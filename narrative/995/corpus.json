{"ori_id":"e57471b92e3889301c10fbf9eb8d78204ca7d80e","title":"The Eustace Diamonds","context":"The Eustace Diamonds\n In this novel, the characters of Plantagenet Palliser, his wife Lady Glencora and their uncle the ailing Duke of Omnium are in the background. The plot centres on Lizzie Greystock, a fortune-hunter who ensnares the sickly, dissipated Sir Florian Eustace and is soon left a very wealthy widow and mother. While clever and beautiful, Lizzie has several character flaws; the greatest of these is an almost pathological delight in lying, even when it cannot benefit her. (Trollope comments that Lizzie sees lies as \"more beautiful than the truth.\") Before he dies, the disillusioned Sir Florian discovers all this, but does not think to change the generous terms of his will.\nThe diamonds of the book's title are a necklace, a family heirloom that Sir Florian gave to Lizzie to wear. Though they belong to her husband's estate (and thus eventually will be the property of her son), Lizzie refuses to relinquish them. She lies about the terms under which they were given to her, leaving their ownership unclear. The indignant Eustace family lawyer, Mr Camperdown, strives to retrieve the necklace, putting the Eustaces in an awkward position. On the one hand, the diamonds are valuable and Lizzie may not have a legal claim to them, but on the other, they do not want to antagonise the mother of the heir to the family estate (Lizzie having only a life interest).\nMeanwhile, after a respectable period of mourning, Lizzie searches for another husband, a dashing \"Corsair\" more in keeping with her extravagantly romantic fantasies. She becomes engaged to a dull, but honourable politician, Lord Fawn, but they have a falling out when her character becomes better known, especially her determination to keep the diamonds. She then considers her cousin, Frank Greystock, even though he is already engaged to Lucy Morris, a poor but much beloved governess of the Fawn daughters. Greystock is a successful lawyer and Member of Parliament, but his income is inadequate to his position and spendthrift lifestyle. Lizzie believes he can shield her from the legal proceedings being initiated by Mr Camperdown. Another more Corsair-like possibility is one of the guests at her Scottish home, the older Lord George de Bruce Carruthers, a man who supports himself in a somewhat mysterious manner.\nAmong the other guests is a young woman named Lucinda Roanoke, whose financially straitened aunt, Mrs Carbuncle, is desperate to marry her off. Despite Lucinda's deep detestation of the brutish Sir Griffin Tewett, the aunt has her way and the mismatched couple become engaged.\nThings take a dramatic turn on a trip to London. Lizzie, out of fear of Mr Camperdown, keeps her diamonds with her in a conspicuous strongbox. One night, at an inn, the strongbox is stolen and everybody assumes the jewellery is lost. As it turns out, Lizzie had taken the gems out and put them under her pillow, but acting on her first instincts, she perjures herself when she has to report the theft to the magistrate, thinking that she can sell the diamonds and let the robbers take the blame. Suspicion falls on both Lizzie and Lord George, acting either together or separately. In any case, the thieves, aided by Lizzie's disloyal maid, Patience Crabstick, try again and succeed in their second attempt. Lizzie feigns illness and takes to her bed. Lady Glencora Palliser pays Lizzie a visit to offer her sympathy.\nThe police begin to unravel the mystery, putting Lizzie in a very uncomfortable position. In the end, the diamonds are lost, the police discover the truth, and Lizzie is forced to confess her lies, though she escapes legal retribution since her testimony is needed to convict the criminals. Both Frank Greystock and Lord George become disgusted by her conduct and desert her. Lucinda Roanoke grows to loathe Sir Griffin more and more intensely until, on what would have been the day of their wedding, she loses her sanity. Frank Greystock returns to Fawn Court to marry Lucy Morris. Mr Emilius, a foreign crypto-Jewish clergyman, woos Lizzie while she is in a vulnerable state and succeeds in marrying her (though it is hinted earlier in the book and is later confirmed in Phineas Redux that he is already married).\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, The Eustace Diamonds, by Anthony Trollope\n\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

What Was Said About It All at Matching\n\n\n\n\nVOLUME I\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nLizzie Greystock\n\n\nIt was admitted by all her friends, and also by her enemies,--who\nwere in truth the more numerous and active body of the two,--that\nLizzie Greystock had done very well with herself. We will tell the\nstory of Lizzie Greystock from the beginning, but we will not dwell\nover it at great length, as we might do if we loved her. She was the\nonly child of old Admiral Greystock, who in the latter years of his\nlife was much perplexed by the possession of a daughter. The admiral\nwas a man who liked whist, wine,--and wickedness in general we may\nperhaps say, and whose ambition it was to live every day of his life\nup to the end of it. People say that he succeeded, and that the\nwhist, wine, and wickedness were there, at the side even of his dying\nbed. He had no particular fortune, and yet his daughter, when she was\nlittle more than a child, went about everywhere with jewels on her\nfingers, and red gems hanging round her neck, and yellow gems pendent\nfrom her ears, and white gems shining in her black hair. She was\nhardly nineteen when her father died and she was taken home by that\ndreadful old termagant, her aunt, Lady Linlithgow. Lizzie would have\nsooner gone to any other friend or relative, had there been any other\nfriend or relative to take her possessed of a house in town. Her\nuncle, Dean Greystock, of Bobsborough, would have had her, and a more\ngood-natured old soul than the dean's wife did not exist,--and there\nwere three pleasant, good-tempered girls in the deanery, who had\nmade various little efforts at friendship with their cousin Lizzie;\nbut Lizzie had higher ideas for herself than life in the deanery at\nBobsborough. She hated Lady Linlithgow. During her father's lifetime,\nwhen she hoped to be able to settle herself before his death, she was\nnot in the habit of concealing her hatred for Lady Linlithgow. Lady\nLinlithgow was not indeed amiable or easily managed. But when the\nadmiral died, Lizzie did not hesitate for a moment in going to the\nold \"vulturess,\" as she was in the habit of calling the countess in\nher occasional correspondence with the girls at Bobsborough.\n\nThe admiral died greatly in debt;--so much so that it was a marvel\nhow tradesmen had trusted him. There was literally nothing left\nfor anybody,--and Messrs. Harter and Benjamin of Old Bond Street\ncondescended to call at Lady Linlithgow's house in Brook Street, and\nto beg that the jewels supplied during the last twelve months might\nbe returned. Lizzie protested that there were no jewels,--nothing\nto signify, nothing worth restoring. Lady Linlithgow had seen the\ndiamonds, and demanded an explanation. They had been \"parted with,\"\nby the admiral's orders,--so said Lizzie,--for the payment of other\ndebts. Of this Lady Linlithgow did not believe a word, but she could\nnot get at any exact truth. At that moment the jewels were in very\ntruth pawned for money which had been necessary for Lizzie's needs.\nCertain things must be paid for,--one's own maid for instance; and\none must have some money in one's pocket for railway-trains and\nlittle knick-knacks which cannot be had on credit. Lizzie when she\nwas nineteen knew how to do without money as well as most girls; but\nthere were calls which she could not withstand, debts which even she\nmust pay.\n\nShe did not, however, drop her acquaintance with Messrs. Harter and\nBenjamin. Before her father had been dead eight months, she was\ncloseted with Mr. Benjamin, transacting a little business with him.\nShe had come to him, she told him, the moment she was of age, and\nwas willing to make herself responsible for the debt, signing any\nbill, note, or document which the firm might demand from her, to that\neffect. Of course she had nothing of her own, and never would have\nanything. That Mr. Benjamin knew. As for payment of the debt by Lady\nLinlithgow, who for a countess was as poor as Job, Mr. Benjamin,\nshe was quite sure, did not expect anything of the kind. But-- Then\nLizzie paused, and Mr. Benjamin, with the sweetest and wittiest\nof smiles, suggested that perhaps Miss Greystock was going to be\nmarried. Lizzie, with a pretty maiden blush, admitted that such a\ncatastrophe was probable. She had been asked in marriage by Sir\nFlorian Eustace. Now Mr. Benjamin knew, as all the world knew, that\nSir Florian Eustace was a very rich man indeed; a man in no degree\nembarrassed, and who could pay any amount of jewellers' bills for\nwhich claim might be made upon him. Well; what did Miss Greystock\nwant? Mr. Benjamin did not suppose that Miss Greystock was actuated\nsimply by a desire to have her old bills paid by her future husband.\nMiss Greystock wanted a loan sufficient to take the jewels out of\npawn. She would then make herself responsible for the full amount\ndue. Mr. Benjamin said that he would make a few inquiries. \"But you\nwon't betray me,\" said Lizzie, \"for the match might be off.\" Mr.\nBenjamin promised to be more than cautious.\n\nThere was not so much of falsehood as might have been expected in the\nstatement which Lizzie Greystock made to the jeweller. It was not\ntrue that she was of age, and therefore no future husband would be\nlegally liable for any debt which she might then contract. And it was\nnot true that Sir Florian Eustace had asked her in marriage. Those\ntwo little blemishes in her statement must be admitted. But it was\ntrue that Sir Florian was at her feet, and that by a proper use of\nher various charms,--the pawned jewels included,--she might bring\nhim to an offer. Mr. Benjamin made his inquiries, and acceded to the\nproposal. He did not tell Miss Greystock that she had lied to him in\nthat matter of her age, though he had discovered the lie. Sir Florian\nwould no doubt pay the bill for his wife without any arguments as\nto the legality of the claim. From such information as Mr. Benjamin\ncould acquire he thought that there would be a marriage, and that\nthe speculation was on the whole in his favour. Lizzie recovered\nher jewels and Mr. Benjamin was in possession of a promissory note\npurporting to have been executed by a person who was no longer a\nminor. The jeweller was ultimately successful in his views,--and so\nwas the lady.\n\nLady Linlithgow saw the jewels come back, one by one, ring added\nto ring on the little taper fingers, the rubies for the neck, and\nthe pendent yellow earrings. Though Lizzie was in mourning for her\nfather, still these things were allowed to be visible. The countess\nwas not the woman to see them without inquiry, and she inquired\nvigorously. She threatened, stormed, and protested. She attempted\neven a raid upon the young lady's jewel-box. But she was not\nsuccessful. Lizzie snapped and snarled and held her own,--for at that\ntime the match with Sir Florian was near its accomplishment, and\nthe countess understood too well the value of such a disposition of\nher niece to risk it at the moment by any open rupture. The little\nhouse in Brook Street,--for the house was very small and very\ncomfortless,--a house that had been squeezed in, as it were, between\ntwo others without any fitting space for it,--did not contain a happy\nfamily. One bedroom, and that the biggest, was appropriated to the\nEarl of Linlithgow, the son of the countess, a young man who passed\nperhaps five nights in town during the year. Other inmate there was\nnone besides the aunt and the niece and the four servants,--of whom\none was Lizzie's own maid. Why should such a countess have troubled\nherself with the custody of such a niece? Simply because the\ncountess regarded it as a duty. Lady Linlithgow was worldly, stingy,\nill-tempered, selfish, and mean. Lady Linlithgow would cheat a\nbutcher out of a mutton-chop, or a cook out of a month's wages, if\nshe could do so with some slant of legal wind in her favour. She\nwould tell any number of lies to carry a point in what she believed\nto be social success. It was said of her that she cheated at cards.\nIn back-biting, no venomous old woman between Bond Street and Park\nLane could beat her,--or, more wonderful still, no venomous old man\nat the clubs. But nevertheless she recognised certain duties,--and\nperformed them, though she hated them. She went to church, not merely\nthat people might see her there,--as to which in truth she cared\nnothing,--but because she thought it was right. And she took in\nLizzie Greystock, whom she hated almost as much as she did sermons,\nbecause the admiral's wife had been her sister, and she recognised\na duty. But, having thus bound herself to Lizzie,--who was a\nbeauty,--of course it became the first object of her life to get rid\nof Lizzie by a marriage. And, though she would have liked to think\nthat Lizzie would be tormented all her days, though she thoroughly\nbelieved that Lizzie deserved to be tormented, she set her heart upon\na splendid match. She would at any rate be able to throw it daily in\nher niece's teeth that the splendour was of her doing. Now a marriage\nwith Sir Florian Eustace would be very splendid, and therefore she\nwas unable to go into the matter of the jewels with that rigour which\nin other circumstances she would certainly have displayed.\n\nThe match with Sir Florian Eustace,--for a match it came to\nbe,--was certainly very splendid. Sir Florian was a young man\nabout eight-and-twenty, very handsome, of immense wealth, quite\nunencumbered, moving in the best circles, popular, so far prudent\nthat he never risked his fortune on the turf or in gambling-houses,\nwith the reputation of a gallant soldier, and a most devoted lover.\nThere were two facts concerning him which might, or might not, be\ntaken as objections. He was vicious, and--he was dying. When a\nfriend, intending to be kind, hinted the latter circumstance to Lady\nLinlithgow, the countess blinked and winked and nodded, and then\nswore that she had procured medical advice on the subject. Medical\nadvice declared that Sir Florian was not more likely to die than\nanother man,--if only he would get married; all of which statement on\nher ladyship's part was a lie. When the same friend hinted the same\nthing to Lizzie herself, Lizzie resolved that she would have her\nrevenge upon that friend. At any rate the courtship went on.\n\nWe have said that Sir Florian was vicious;--but he was not altogether\na bad man, nor was he vicious in the common sense of the word. He was\none who denied himself no pleasure, let the cost be what it might in\nhealth, pocket, or morals. Of sin or wickedness he had probably no\ndistinct idea. In virtue, as an attribute of the world around him, he\nhad no belief. Of honour he thought very much, and had conceived a\nsomewhat noble idea that because much had been given to him much was\ndemanded of him. He was haughty, polite,--and very generous. There\nwas almost a nobility even about his vices. And he had a special\ngallantry of which it is hard to say whether it is or is not to be\nadmired. They told him that he was like to die,--very like to die, if\nhe did not change his manner of living. Would he go to Algiers for a\nperiod? Certainly not. He would do no such thing. If he died, there\nwas his brother John left to succeed him. And the fear of death never\ncast a cloud over that grandly beautiful brow. They had all been\nshort-lived,--the Eustaces. Consumption had swept a hecatomb of\nvictims from the family. But still they were grand people, and never\nwere afraid of death.\n\nAnd then Sir Florian fell in love. Discussing this matter with his\nbrother, who was perhaps his only intimate friend, he declared that\nif the girl he loved would give herself to him, he would make what\natonement he could to her for his own early death by a princely\nsettlement. John Eustace, who was somewhat nearly concerned in\nthe matter, raised no objection to this proposal. There was ever\nsomething grand about these Eustaces. Sir Florian was a grand\ngentleman; but surely he must have been dull of intellect, slow of\ndiscernment, blear-eyed in his ways about the town, when he took\nLizzie Greystock,--of all the women whom he could find in the\nworld,--to be the purest, the truest, and the noblest. It has been\nsaid of Sir Florian that he did not believe in virtue. He freely\nexpressed disbelief in the virtue of women around him,--in the virtue\nof women of all ranks. But he believed in his mother and sisters as\nthough they were heaven-born; and he was one who could believe in his\nwife as though she were the queen of heaven. He did believe in Lizzie\nGreystock, thinking that intellect, purity, truth, and beauty, each\nperfect in its degree, were combined in her. The intellect and beauty\nwere there;--but, for the purity and truth--; how could it have been\nthat such a one as Sir Florian Eustace should have been so blind!\n\nSir Florian was not, indeed, a clever man; but he believed himself\nto be a fool. And believing himself to be a fool, he desired, nay,\npainfully longed, for some of those results of cleverness which\nmight, he thought, come to him, from contact with a clever woman.\nLizzie read poetry well, and she read verses to him,--sitting very\nnear to him, almost in the dark, with a shaded lamp throwing its\nlight on her book. He was astonished to find how sweet a thing was\npoetry. By himself he could never read a line, but as it came from\nher lips it seemed to charm him. It was a new pleasure, and one\nwhich, though he had ridiculed it, he had so often coveted! And\nthen she told him of such wondrous thoughts,--such wondrous joys\nin the world which would come from thinking! He was proud, I have\nsaid, and haughty; but he was essentially modest and humble in his\nself-estimation. How divine was this creature, whose voice to him was\nas that of a goddess!\n\nThen he spoke out to her, with his face a little turned from her.\nWould she be his wife? But, before she answered him, let her listen\nto him. They had told him that an early death must probably be his\nfate. He did not himself feel that it must be so. Sometimes he was\nill,--very ill; but often he was well. If she would run the risk with\nhim he would endeavour to make her such recompense as might come from\nhis wealth. The speech he made was somewhat long, and as he made it\nhe hardly looked into her face.\n\nBut it was necessary to him that he should be made to know by some\nsignal from her how it was going with her feelings. As he spoke of\nhis danger, there came a gurgling little trill of wailing from her\nthroat, a soft, almost musical sound of woe, which seemed to add an\nunaccustomed eloquence to his words. When he spoke of his own hope\nthe sound was somewhat changed, but it was still continued. When he\nalluded to the disposition of his fortune, she was at his feet. \"Not\nthat,\" she said, \"not that!\" He lifted her, and with his arm round\nher waist he tried to tell her what it would be his duty to do\nfor her. She escaped from his arm and would not listen to him.\nBut,--but--! When he began to talk of love again, she stood with her\nforehead bowed against his bosom. Of course the engagement was then a\nthing accomplished.\n\nBut still the cup might slip from her lips. Her father was now dead\nbut ten months, and what answer could she make when the common\npressing petition for an early marriage was poured into her ear? This\nwas in July, and it would never do that he should be left, unmarried,\nto the rigour of another winter. She looked into his face and knew\nthat she had cause for fear. Oh, heavens! if all these golden hopes\nshould fall to the ground, and she should come to be known only as\nthe girl who had been engaged to the late Sir Florian! But he himself\npressed the marriage on the same ground. \"They tell me,\" he said,\n\"that I had better get a little south by the beginning of October.\nI won't go alone. You know what I mean;--eh, Lizzie?\" Of course she\nmarried him in September.\n\nThey spent a honeymoon of six weeks at a place he had in Scotland,\nand the first blow came upon him as they passed through London, back\nfrom Scotland, on their way to Italy. Messrs. Harter and Benjamin\nsent in their little bill, which amounted to something over \u00c2\u00a3400, and\nother little bills were sent in. Sir Florian was a man by whom such\nbills would certainly be paid, but by whom they would not be paid\nwithout his understanding much and conceiving more as to their\ncause and nature. How much he really did understand she was never\nquite aware;--but she did know that he detected her in a positive\nfalsehood. She might certainly have managed the matter better than\nshe did; and had she admitted everything there might probably have\nbeen but few words about it. She did not, however, understand the\nnature of the note she had signed, and thought that simply new bills\nwould be presented by the jewellers to her husband. She gave a false\naccount of the transaction, and the lie was detected. I do not\nknow that she cared very much. As she was utterly devoid of true\ntenderness, so also was she devoid of conscience. They went abroad,\nhowever; and by the time the winter was half over in Naples, he knew\nwhat his wife was;--and before the end of the spring he was dead.\n\nShe had so far played her game well, and had won her stakes. What\nregrets, what remorse she suffered when she knew that he was going\nfrom her,--and then knew that he was gone, who can say? As man is\nnever strong enough to take unmixed delight in good, so may we\npresume also that he cannot be quite so weak as to find perfect\nsatisfaction in evil. There must have been qualms as she looked at\nhis dying face, soured with the disappointment she had brought upon\nhim, and listened to the harsh querulous voice that was no longer\neager in the expressions of love. There must have been some pang when\nshe reflected that the cruel wrong which she had inflicted on him had\nprobably hurried him to his grave. As a widow, in the first solemnity\nof her widowhood, she was wretched and would see no one. Then she\nreturned to England and shut herself up in a small house at Brighton.\nLady Linlithgow offered to go to her, but she begged that she might\nbe left to herself. For a few short months the awe arising from the\nrapidity with which it had all occurred did afflict her. Twelve\nmonths since she had hardly known the man who was to be her husband.\nNow she was a widow,--a widow very richly endowed,--and she bore\nbeneath her bosom the fruit of her husband's love.\n\nBut, even in these early days, friends and enemies did not hesitate\nto say that Lizzie Greystock had done very well with herself; for it\nwas known by all concerned that in the settlements made she had been\ntreated with unwonted generosity.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nLady Eustace\n\n\nThere were circumstances in her position which made it impossible\nthat Lizzie Greystock,--or Lady Eustace, as we must now call\nher,--should be left altogether to herself in the modest widow's\nretreat which she had found at Brighton. It was then April, and it\nwas known that if all things went well with her, she would be a\nmother before the summer was over. On what the Fates might ordain\nin this matter immense interests were dependent. If a son should be\nborn he would inherit everything, subject, of course, to his mother's\nsettlement. If a daughter, to her would belong the great personal\nwealth which Sir Florian had owned at the time of his death. Should\nthere be no son, John Eustace, the brother, would inherit the estates\nin Yorkshire which had been the backbone of the Eustace wealth.\nShould no child be born, John Eustace would inherit everything that\nhad not been settled upon or left to the widow. Sir Florian had made\na settlement immediately before his marriage, and a will immediately\nafterwards. Of what he had done then, nothing had been altered in\nthose sad Italian days. The settlement had been very generous. The\nwhole property in Scotland was to belong to Lizzie for her life,--and\nafter her death was to go to a second son, if such second son there\nshould be. By the will money was left to her, more than would be\nneeded for any possible temporary emergency. When she knew how it was\nall arranged,--as far as she did know it,--she was aware that she was\na rich woman. For so clever a woman she was infinitely ignorant as\nto the possession and value of money and land and income,--though,\nperhaps, not more ignorant than are most young girls under\ntwenty-one. As for the Scotch property,--she thought that it was her\nown, for ever, because there could not now be a second son,--and yet\nwas not quite sure whether it would be her own at all if she had\nno son. Concerning that sum of money left to her, she did not know\nwhether it was to come out of the Scotch property or be given to\nher separately,--and whether it was to come annually or to come\nonly once. She had received, while still in Naples, a letter from\nthe family lawyer, giving her such details of the will as it was\nnecessary that she should know, and now she longed to ask questions,\nto have her belongings made plain to her, and to realise her wealth.\nShe had brilliant prospects; and yet, through it all, there was a\nsense of loneliness that nearly killed her. Would it not have been\nmuch better if her husband had lived, and still worshipped her, and\nstill allowed her to read poetry to him? But she had read no poetry\nto him after that affair of Messrs. Harter and Benjamin.\n\nThe reader has, or will have, but little to do with these days, and\nmay be hurried on through the twelve, or even twenty-four months\nwhich followed the death of poor Sir Florian. The question of the\nheirship, however, was very grave, and early in the month of May\nLady Eustace was visited by her husband's uncle, Bishop Eustace, of\nBobsborough. The bishop had been the younger brother of Sir Florian's\nfather,--was at this time a man about fifty, very active and very\npopular,--and was one who stood high in the world, even among\nbishops. He suggested to his niece-in-law that it was very expedient\nthat, during her coming hour of trial, she should not absent herself\nfrom her husband's family, and at last persuaded her to take up her\nresidence at the palace at Bobsborough till such time as the event\nshould be over. Lady Eustace was taken to the palace, and in due time\na son was born. John, who was now the uncle of the heir, came down,\nand, with the frankest good humour, declared that he would devote\nhimself to the little head of the family. He had been left as\nguardian, and the management of the great family estates was to be in\nhis hands. Lizzie had read no poetry to him, and he had never liked\nher, and the bishop did not like her, and the ladies of the bishop's\nfamily disliked her very much, and it was thought by them that the\ndean's people,--the Dean of Bobsborough was Lizzie's uncle,--were not\nvery fond of Lizzie since Lizzie had so raised herself in the world\nas to want no assistance from them. But still they were bound to do\ntheir duty by her as the widow of the late and the mother of the\npresent baronet. And they did not find much cause of complaining as\nto Lizzie's conduct in these days. In that matter of the great family\ndiamond necklace,--which certainly should not have been taken to\nNaples at all, and as to which the jeweller had told the lawyer and\nthe lawyer had told John Eustace that it certainly should not now be\ndetained among the widow's own private property,--the bishop strongly\nrecommended that nothing should be said at present. The mistake, if\nthere was a mistake, could be remedied at any time. And nothing in\nthose very early days was said about the great Eustace necklace,\nwhich afterwards became so famous.\n\nWhy Lizzie should have been so generally disliked by the Eustaces, it\nmight be hard to explain. While she remained at the palace she was\nvery discreet,--and perhaps demure. It may be said they disliked her\nexpressed determination to cut her aunt, Lady Linlithgow;--for they\nknew that Lady Linlithgow had been, at any rate, a friend to Lizzie\nGreystock. There are people who can be wise within a certain margin,\nbut beyond that commit great imprudences. Lady Eustace submitted\nherself to the palace people for that period of her prostration, but\nshe could not hold her tongue as to her future intentions. She would,\ntoo, now and then ask of Mrs. Eustace, and even of her daughter, an\neager, anxious question about her own property. \"She is dying to\nhandle her money,\" said Mrs. Eustace to the bishop. \"She is only like\nthe rest of the world in that,\" said the bishop. \"If she would be\nreally open, I wouldn't mind it,\" said Mrs. Eustace. None of them\nliked her,--and she did not like them.\n\nShe remained at the palace for six months, and at the end of that\ntime she went to her own place in Scotland. Mrs. Eustace had strongly\nadvised her to ask her aunt, Lady Linlithgow, to accompany her,\nbut in refusing to do this, Lizzie was quite firm. She had endured\nLady Linlithgow for that year between her father's death and her\nmarriage; she was now beginning to dare to hope for the enjoyment\nof the good things which she had won, and the presence of the\ndowager-countess,--\"the vulturess,\"--was certainly not one of these\ngood things. In what her enjoyment was to consist, she had not as\nyet quite formed a definite conclusion. She liked jewels. She liked\nadmiration. She liked the power of being arrogant to those around\nher. And she liked good things to eat. But there were other matters\nthat were also dear to her. She did like music,--though it may be\ndoubted whether she would ever play it or even listen to it alone.\nShe did like reading, and especially the reading of poetry,--though\neven in this she was false and pretentious, skipping, pretending to\nhave read, lying about books, and making up her market of literature\nfor outside admiration at the easiest possible cost of trouble. And\nshe had some dream of being in love, and would take delight even in\nbuilding castles in the air, which she would people with friends\nand lovers whom she would make happy with the most open-hearted\nbenevolence. She had theoretical ideas of life which were not\nbad,--but in practice, she had gained her objects, and she was in a\nhurry to have liberty to enjoy them.\n\nThere was considerable anxiety in the palace in reference to the\nfuture mode of life of Lady Eustace. Had it not been for that\nbaby-heir, of course there would have been no cause for interference;\nbut the rights of that baby were so serious and important that it was\nalmost impossible not to interfere. The mother, however, gave some\nlittle signs that she did not intend to submit to much interference,\nand there was no real reason why she should not be as free as\nair. But did she really intend to go down to Portray Castle all\nalone;--that is, with her baby and nurses? This was ended by an\narrangement, in accordance with which she was accompanied by her\neldest cousin, Ellinor Greystock, a lady who was just ten years\nher senior. There could hardly be a better woman than Ellinor\nGreystock,--or a more good-humoured, kindly being. After many debates\nin the deanery and in the palace,--for there was much friendship\nbetween the two ecclesiastical establishments,--the offer was made\nand the advice given. Ellinor had accepted the martyrdom on the\nunderstanding that if the advice were accepted she was to remain at\nPortray Castle for three months. After a long discussion between Lady\nEustace and the bishop's wife the offer was accepted, and the two\nladies went to Scotland together.\n\nDuring those three months the widow still bided her time. Of her\nfuture ideas of life she said not a word to her companion. Of her\ninfant she said very little. She would talk of books,--choosing\nsuch books as her cousin did not read; and she would interlard her\nconversation with much Italian, because her cousin did not know\nthe language. There was a carriage kept by the widow, and they had\nthemselves driven out together. Of real companionship there was\nnone. Lizzie was biding her time, and at the end of the three months\nMiss Greystock thankfully, and, indeed, of necessity, returned to\nBobsborough. \"I've done no good,\" she said to her mother, \"and have\nbeen very uncomfortable.\" \"My dear,\" said her mother, \"we have\ndisposed of three months out of a two years' period of danger. In two\nyears from Sir Florian's death she will be married again.\"\n\nWhen this was said Lizzie had been a widow nearly a year, and had\nbided her time upon the whole discreetly. Some foolish letters she\nhad written,--chiefly to the lawyer about her money and property; and\nsome foolish things she had said,--as when she told Ellinor Greystock\nthat the Portray property was her own for ever, to do what she liked\nwith it. The sum of money left to her by her husband had by that time\nbeen paid into her own hands, and she had opened a banker's account.\nThe revenues from the Scotch estate,--some \u00c2\u00a34,000 a year,--were\nclearly her own for life. The family diamond-necklace was still in\nher possession, and no answer had been given by her to a postscript\nto a lawyer's letter in which a little advice had been given\nrespecting it. At the end of another year, when she had just\nreached the age of twenty-two, and had completed her second year\nof widowhood, she was still Lady Eustace, thus contradicting the\nprophecy made by the dean's wife. It was then spring, and she had\na house of her own in London. She had broken openly with Lady\nLinlithgow. She had opposed, though not absolutely refused, all\novertures of brotherly care from John Eustace. She had declined\na further invitation, both for herself and for her child, to the\npalace. And she had positively asserted her intention of keeping the\ndiamonds. Her late husband, she said, had given the diamonds to her.\nAs they were supposed to be worth \u00c2\u00a310,000, and were really family\ndiamonds, the matter was felt by all concerned to be one of much\nimportance. And she was oppressed by a heavy load of ignorance, which\nbecame serious from the isolation of her position. She had learned to\ndraw cheques, but she had no other correct notion as to business. She\nknew nothing as to spending money, saving it, or investing it. Though\nshe was clever, sharp, and greedy, she had no idea what her money\nwould do, and what it would not; and there was no one whom she would\ntrust to tell her. She had a young cousin, a barrister,--a son\nof the dean's, whom she perhaps liked better than any other of\nher relations,--but she declined advice even from her friend the\nbarrister. She would have no dealings on her own behalf with the old\nfamily solicitor of the Eustaces,--the gentleman who had now applied\nvery formally for the restitution of the diamonds; but had appointed\nother solicitors to act for her. Messrs. Mowbray and Mopus were of\nopinion that as the diamonds had been given into her hands by her\nhusband without any terms as to their surrender, no one could claim\nthem. Of the manner in which the diamonds had been placed in her\nhands, no one knew more than she chose to tell.\n\nBut when she started with her house in town,--a modest little house\nin Mount Street, near the park,--just two years after her husband's\ndeath, she had a large circle of acquaintances. The Eustace people,\nand the Greystock people, and even the Linlithgow people, did not\nentirely turn their backs on her. The countess, indeed, was very\nvenomous, as she well might be; but then the countess was known for\nher venom. The dean and his family were still anxious that she should\nbe encouraged to discreet living, and, though they feared many\nthings, thought that they had no ground for open complaint. The\nEustace people were forbearing, and hoped the best. \"D---- the\nnecklace!\" John Eustace had said, and the bishop unfortunately had\nheard him say it! \"John,\" said the prelate, \"whatever is to become\nof the bauble, you might express your opinion in more sensible\nlanguage.\" \"I beg your lordship's pardon,\" said John, \"I only mean to\nsay that I think we shouldn't trouble ourselves about a few stones.\"\nBut the family lawyer, Mr. Camperdown, would by no means take this\nview of the matter. It was, however, generally thought that the young\nwidow opened her campaign more prudently than had been expected.\n\nAnd now as so much has been said of the character and fortune and\nspecial circumstances of Lizzie Greystock, who became Lady Eustace\nas a bride, and Lady Eustace as a widow and a mother, all within the\nspace of twelve months, it may be as well to give some description of\nher person and habits, such as they were at the period in which our\nstory is supposed to have its commencement. It must be understood in\nthe first place that she was very lovely;--much more so, indeed, now\nthan when she had fascinated Sir Florian. She was small, but taller\nthan she looked to be,--for her form was perfectly symmetrical. Her\nfeet and hands might have been taken as models by a sculptor. Her\nfigure was lithe, and soft, and slim, and slender. If it had a fault\nit was this,--that it had in it too much of movement. There were some\nwho said that she was almost snake-like in her rapid bendings and\nthe almost too easy gestures of her body; for she was much given to\naction, and to the expression of her thought by the motion of her\nlimbs. She might certainly have made her way as an actress, had\nfortune called upon her to earn her bread in that fashion. And her\nvoice would have suited the stage. It was powerful when she called\nupon it for power; but, at the same time, flexible and capable of\nmuch pretence at feeling. She could bring it to a whisper that would\nalmost melt your heart with tenderness,--as she had melted Sir\nFlorian's, when she sat near to him reading poetry; and then she\ncould raise it to a pitch of indignant wrath befitting a Lady Macbeth\nwhen her husband ventured to rebuke her. And her ear was quite\ncorrect in modulating these tones. She knew,--and it must have been\nby instinct, for her culture in such matters was small,--how to use\nher voice so that neither its tenderness nor its wrath should be\nmisapplied. There were pieces in verse that she could read,--things\nnot wondrously good in themselves,--so that she would ravish you; and\nshe would so look at you as she did it that you would hardly dare\neither to avert your eyes or to return her gaze. Sir Florian had not\nknown whether to do the one thing or the other, and had therefore\nseized her in his arms. Her face was oval,--somewhat longer than an\noval,--with little in it, perhaps nothing in it, of that brilliancy\nof colour which we call complexion. And yet the shades of her\ncountenance were ever changing between the softest and most\ntransparent white, and the richest, mellowest shades of brown. It\nwas only when she simulated anger,--she was almost incapable of real\nanger,--that she would succeed in calling the thinnest streak of pink\nfrom her heart, to show that there was blood running in her veins.\nHer hair, which was nearly black,--but in truth with more of softness\nand of lustre than ever belong to hair that is really black,--she\nwore bound tight round her perfect forehead, with one long love-lock\nhanging over her shoulder. The form of her head was so good that\nshe could dare to carry it without a chignon, or any adventitious\nadjuncts from an artiste's shop. Very bitter was she in consequence\nwhen speaking of the head-gear of other women. Her chin was perfect\nin its round, not over long,--as is the case with so many such faces,\nutterly spoiling the symmetry of the countenance. But it lacked a\ndimple, and therefore lacked feminine tenderness. Her mouth was\nperhaps faulty in being too small, or, at least, her lips were\ntoo thin. There was wanting from the mouth that expression of\neager-speaking truthfulness which full lips will often convey. Her\nteeth were without flaw or blemish, even, small, white, and delicate;\nbut perhaps they were shown too often. Her nose was small, but struck\nmany as the prettiest feature of her face, so exquisite was the\nmoulding of it, and so eloquent and so graceful the slight inflations\nof the transparent nostrils. Her eyes, in which she herself thought\nthat the lustre of her beauty lay, were blue and clear, bright as\ncerulean waters. They were long large eyes,--but very dangerous. To\nthose who knew how to read a face, there was danger plainly written\nin them. Poor Sir Florian had not known. But, in truth, the charm\nof her face did not lie in her eyes. This was felt by many even who\ncould not read the book fluently. They were too expressive, too loud\nin their demands for attention, and they lacked tenderness. How few\nthere are among women, few perhaps also among men, who know that the\nsweetest, softest, tenderest, truest eyes which a woman can carry in\nher head are green in colour! Lizzie's eyes were not tender,--neither\nwere they true. But they were surmounted by the most wonderfully\npencilled eyebrows that ever nature unassisted planted on a woman's\nface.\n\nWe have said that she was clever. We must add that she had in truth\nstudied much. She spoke French, understood Italian, and read German.\nShe played well on the harp, and moderately well on the piano. She\nsang, at least in good taste and in tune. Of things to be learned\nby reading she knew much, having really taken diligent trouble with\nherself. She had learned much poetry by heart, and could apply it.\nShe forgot nothing, listened to everything, understood quickly, and\nwas desirous to show not only as a beauty but as a wit. There were\nmen at this time who declared that she was simply the cleverest and\nthe handsomest woman in England. As an independent young woman she\nwas perhaps one of the richest.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nLucy Morris\n\n\nAlthough the first two chapters of this new history have been\ndevoted to the fortunes and personal attributes of Lady Eustace,\nthe historian begs his readers not to believe that that opulent and\naristocratic Becky Sharp is to assume the dignity of heroine in the\nforthcoming pages. That there shall be any heroine the historian will\nnot take upon himself to assert; but if there be a heroine, that\nheroine shall not be Lady Eustace. Poor Lizzie Greystock!--as men\ndouble her own age, and who had known her as a forward, capricious,\nspoilt child in her father's lifetime, would still call her. She did\nso many things, made so many efforts, caused so much suffering to\nothers, and suffered so much herself throughout the scenes with which\nwe are about to deal, that the story can hardly be told without\ngiving her that prominence of place which has been assigned to her in\nthe last two chapters.\n\nNor does the chronicler dare to put forward Lucy Morris as a heroine.\nThe real heroine, if it be found possible to arrange her drapery for\nher becomingly, and to put that part which she enacted into properly\nheroic words, shall stalk in among us at some considerably later\nperiod of the narrative, when the writer shall have accustomed\nhimself to the flow of words, and have worked himself up to a state\nof mind fit for the reception of noble acting and noble speaking. In\nthe meantime, let it be understood that poor little Lucy Morris was\na governess in the house of old Lady Fawn, when our beautiful young\nwidow established herself in Mount Street.\n\nLady Eustace and Lucy Morris had known each other for many\nyears,--had indeed been children together,--there having been some\nold family friendship between the Greystocks and the Morrises. When\nthe admiral's wife was living, Lucy had, as a little girl of eight or\nnine, been her guest. She had often been a guest at the deanery. When\nLady Eustace had gone down to the bishop's palace at Bobsborough, in\norder that an heir to the Eustaces might be born under an auspicious\nroof, Lucy Morris was with the Greystocks. Lucy, who was a year\nyounger than Lizzie, had at that time been an orphan for the last\nfour years. She too had been left penniless, but no such brilliant\nfuture awaited her as that which Lizzie had earned for herself. There\nwas no countess-aunt to take her into her London house. The dean and\nthe dean's wife and the dean's daughters had been her best friends,\nbut they were not friends on whom she could be dependent. They were\nin no way connected with her by blood. Therefore, at the age of\neighteen, she had gone out to be a child's governess. Then old Lady\nFawn had heard of her virtues,--Lady Fawn, who had seven unmarried\ndaughters running down from seven-and-twenty to thirteen, and Lucy\nMorris had been hired to teach English, French, German, and something\nof music to the two youngest Miss Fawns.\n\nDuring that visit at the deanery, when the heir of the Eustaces was\nbeing born, Lucy was undergoing a sort of probation for the Fawn\nestablishment. The proposed engagement with Lady Fawn was thought to\nbe a great thing for her. Lady Fawn was known as a miracle of Virtue,\nBenevolence, and Persistency. Every good quality that she possessed\nwas so marked as to be worthy of being expressed with a capital.\nBut her virtues were of that extraordinarily high character that\nthere was no weakness in them,--no getting over them, no perverting\nthem with follies or even exaggerations. When she heard of the\nexcellencies of Miss Morris from the dean's wife, and then, after\nminutest investigation, learned the exact qualities of the young\nlady, she expressed herself willing to take Lucy into her house on\nspecial conditions. She must be able to teach music up to a certain\npoint. \"Then it's all over,\" said Lucy to the dean with her pretty\nsmile,--that smile which caused all the old and middle-aged men to\nfall in love with her. \"It's not over at all,\" said the dean. \"You've\ngot four months. Our organist is about as good a teacher as there is\nin England. You are clever and quick, and he shall teach you.\" So\nLucy went to Bobsborough, and was afterwards accepted by Lady Fawn.\n\nWhile she was at the deanery there sprung up a renewed friendship\nbetween her and Lizzie. It was, indeed, chiefly a one-sided\nfriendship; for Lucy, who was quick and unconsciously capable of\nreading that book to which we alluded in a previous chapter, was\nsomewhat afraid of the rich widow. And when Lizzie talked to her\nof their old childish days, and quoted poetry, and spoke of things\nromantic,--as she was much given to do,--Lucy felt that the metal\ndid not ring true. And then Lizzie had an ugly habit of abusing all\nher other friends behind their backs. Now Lucy did not like to hear\nthe Greystocks abused, and would say so. \"That's all very well, you\nlittle minx,\" Lizzie would say playfully, \"but you know that they are\nall asses!\" Lucy by no means thought that the Greystocks were asses,\nand was very strongly of opinion that one of them was as far removed\nfrom being an ass as any human being she had ever known. This one was\nFrank Greystock, the barrister. Of Frank Greystock some special--but,\nlet it be hoped, very short--description must be given by-and-by. For\nthe present it will be sufficient to declare that, during that short\nEaster holiday which he spent at his father's house in Bobsborough,\nhe found Lucy Morris to be a most agreeable companion.\n\n\"Remember her position,\" said Mrs. Dean to her son.\n\n\"Her position! Well;--and what is her position mother?\"\n\n\"You know what I mean, Frank. She is as sweet a girl as ever lived,\nand a perfect lady. But with a governess, unless you mean to marry\nher, you should be more careful than with another girl, because you\nmay do her such a world of mischief.\"\n\n\"I don't see that at all.\"\n\n\"If Lady Fawn knew that she had an admirer, Lady Fawn would not let\nher come into her house.\"\n\n\"Then Lady Fawn is an idiot. If a girl be admirable, of course she\nwill be admired. Who can hinder it?\"\n\n\"You know what I mean, Frank.\"\n\n\"Yes--I do; well. I don't suppose I can afford to marry Lucy Morris.\nAt any rate, mother, I will never say a word to raise a hope in\nher,--if it would be a hope--\"\n\n\"Of course it would be a hope.\"\n\n\"I don't know that at all. But I will never say any such word to\nher,--unless I make up my mind that I can afford to marry her.\"\n\n\"Oh, Frank, it would be impossible!\" said Mrs. Dean.\n\nMrs. Dean was a very good woman, but she had aspirations in the\ndirection of filthy lucre on behalf of her children, or at least on\nbehalf of this special child, and she did think it would be very\nnice if Frank would marry an heiress. This, however, was a long time\nago, nearly two years ago; and many grave things had got themselves\ntransacted since Lucy's visit to the deanery. She had become quite\nan old and an accustomed member of Lady Fawn's family. The youngest\nFawn girl was not yet fifteen, and it was understood that Lucy was to\nremain with the Fawns for some quite indefinite time to come. Lady\nFawn's eldest daughter, Mrs. Hittaway, had a family of her own,\nhaving been married ten or twelve years, and it was quite probable\nthat Lucy might be transferred. Lady Fawn fully appreciated her\ntreasure, and was, and ever had been, conscientiously anxious to make\nLucy's life happy. But she thought that a governess should not be\ndesirous of marrying, at any rate till a somewhat advanced period of\nlife. A governess, if she were given to falling in love, could hardly\nperform her duties in life. No doubt, not to be a governess, but a\nyoung lady free from the embarrassing necessity of earning bread,\nfree to have a lover and a husband, would be upon the whole nicer.\nSo it is nicer to be born to \u00c2\u00a310,000 a year than to have to wish for\n\u00c2\u00a3500. Lady Fawn could talk excellent sense on this subject by the\nhour, and always admitted that much was due to a governess who knew\nher place and did her duty. She was very fond of Lucy Morris, and\ntreated her dependent with affectionate consideration;--but she did\nnot approve of visits from Mr. Frank Greystock. Lucy, blushing up\nto the eyes, had once declared that she desired to have no personal\nvisitors at Lady Fawn's house; but that, as regarded her own\nfriendships, the matter was one for her own bosom. \"Dear Miss\nMorris,\" Lady Fawn had said, \"we understand each other so perfectly,\nand you are so good, that I am quite sure everything will be as it\nought to be.\" Lady Fawn lived down at Richmond all the year through,\nin a large old-fashioned house with a large old-fashioned garden,\ncalled Fawn Court. After that speech of hers to Lucy, Frank Greystock\ndid not call again at Fawn Court for many months, and it is possible\nthat her ladyship had said a word also to him. But Lady Eustace, with\nher pretty little pair of grey ponies, would sometimes drive down to\nRichmond to see her \"dear little old friend\" Lucy, and her visits\nwere allowed. Lady Fawn had expressed an opinion among her daughters\nthat she did not see any harm in Lady Eustace. She thought that she\nrather liked Lady Eustace. But then Lady Fawn hated Lady Linlithgow\nas only two old women can hate each other;--and she had not heard the\nstory of the diamond necklace.\n\nLucy Morris certainly was a treasure,--a treasure though no heroine.\nShe was a sweetly social, genial little human being whose presence in\nthe house was ever felt to be like sunshine. She was never forward,\nbut never bashful. She was always open to familiar intercourse\nwithout ever putting herself forward. There was no man or woman with\nwhom she would not so talk as to make the man or woman feel that\nthe conversation was remarkably pleasant,--and she could do the\nsame with any child. She was an active, mindful, bright, energetic\nlittle thing to whom no work ever came amiss. She had catalogued\nthe library,--which had been collected by the late Lord Fawn with\npeculiar reference to the Christian theology of the third and fourth\ncenturies. She had planned the new flower-garden,--though Lady Fawn\nthought that she had done that herself. She had been invaluable\nduring Clara Fawn's long illness. She knew every rule at croquet,\nand could play piquet. When the girls got up charades they had to\nacknowledge that everything depended on Miss Morris. They were\ngood-natured, plain, unattractive girls, who spoke of her to her face\nas one who could easily do anything to which she might put her hand.\nLady Fawn did really love her. Lord Fawn, the eldest son, a young man\nof about thirty-five, a Peer of Parliament and an Under-Secretary\nof State,--very prudent and very diligent,--of whom his mother and\nsisters stood in great awe, consulted her frequently and made no\nsecret of his friendship. The mother knew her awful son well, and was\nafraid of nothing wrong in that direction. Lord Fawn had suffered a\ndisappointment in love, but he had consoled himself with blue-books,\nand mastered his passion by incessant attendance at the India Board.\nThe lady he had loved had been rich, and Lord Fawn was poor; but\nnevertheless he had mastered his passion. There was no fear that his\nfeelings towards the governess would become too warm;--nor was it\nlikely that Miss Morris should encounter danger in regard to him. It\nwas quite an understood thing in the family that Lord Fawn must marry\nmoney.\n\nLucy Morris was indeed a treasure. No brighter face ever looked into\nanother to seek sympathy there, either in mirth or woe. There was a\ngleam in her eyes that was almost magnetic, so sure was she to obtain\nby it that community of interest which she desired,--though it were\nbut for a moment. Lord Fawn was pompous, slow, dull, and careful;\nbut even he had given way to it at once. Lady Fawn, too, was very\ncareful, but she had owned to herself long since that she could not\nbear to look forward to any permanent severance. Of course Lucy would\nbe made over to the Hittaways, whose mother lived in Warwick Square,\nand whose father was Chairman of the Board of Civil Appeals. The\nHittaways were the only grandchildren with whom Lady Fawn had as yet\nbeen blessed, and of course Lucy must go to the Hittaways.\n\nShe was but a little thing;--and it cannot be said of her, as of Lady\nEustace, that she was a beauty. The charm of her face consisted in\nthe peculiar, watery brightness of her eyes,--in the corners of which\nit would always seem that a diamond of a tear was lurking whenever\nany matter of excitement was afoot. Her light-brown hair was soft\nand smooth and pretty. As hair it was very well, but it had no\nspeciality. Her mouth was somewhat large, but full of ever-varying\nexpression. Her forehead was low and broad, with prominent temples,\non which it was her habit to clasp tightly her little outstretched\nfingers as she sat listening to you. Of listeners she was the very\nbest, for she would always be saying a word or two, just to help\nyou,--the best word that could be spoken, and then again she would\nbe hanging on your lips. There are listeners who show by their mode\nof listening that they listen as a duty,--not because they are\ninterested. Lucy Morris was not such a one. She would take up your\nsubject, whatever it was, and make it her own. There was forward just\nthen a question as to whether the Sawab of Mygawb should have twenty\nmillions of rupees paid to him and be placed upon a throne, or\nwhether he should be kept in prison all his life. The British world\ngenerally could not be made to interest itself about the Sawab, but\nLucy positively mastered the subject, and almost got Lord Fawn into a\ndifficulty by persuading him to stand up against his chief on behalf\nof the injured prince.\n\nWhat else can be said of her face or personal appearance that will\ninterest a reader? When she smiled, there was the daintiest little\ndimple on her cheek. And when she laughed, that little nose, which\nwas not as well-shaped a nose as it might have been, would almost\nchange its shape and cock itself up in its mirth. Her hands were very\nthin and long, and so were her feet,--by no means models as were\nthose of her friend Lady Eustace. She was a little, thin, quick,\ngraceful creature, whom it was impossible that you should see without\nwishing to have near you. A most unselfish little creature she was,\nbut one who had a well-formed idea of her own identity. She was quite\nresolved to be somebody among her fellow-creatures,--not somebody\nin the way of marrying a lord or a rich man, or somebody in the way\nof being a beauty, or somebody as a wit; but somebody as having a\npurpose and a use in life. She was the humblest little thing in\nthe world in regard to any possible putting of herself forward or\nneedful putting of herself back; and yet, to herself, nobody was her\nsuperior. What she had was her own, whether it was the old grey silk\ndress which she had bought with the money she had earned, or the wit\nwhich nature had given her. And Lord Fawn's title was his own, and\nLady Fawn's rank her own. She coveted no man's possessions,--and no\nwoman's; but she was minded to hold by her own. Of present advantages\nor disadvantages,--whether she had the one or suffered from the\nother,--she thought not at all. It was her fault that she had nothing\nof feminine vanity. But no man or woman was ever more anxious\nto be effective, to persuade, to obtain belief, sympathy, and\nco-operation;--not for any result personal to herself, but because,\nby obtaining these things, she could be effective in the object then\nbefore her, be it what it might.\n\nOne other thing may be told of her. She had given her heart,--for\ngood and all, as she owned to herself,--to Frank Greystock. She\nhad owned to herself that it was so, and had owned to herself that\nnothing could come of it. Frank was becoming a man of mark,--but was\nbecoming a man of mark without much money. Of all men he was the last\nwho could afford to marry a governess. And then, moreover, he had\nnever said a word to make her think that he loved her. He had called\non her once or twice at Fawn Court,--as why should he not? Seeing\nthat there had been friendship between the families for so many\nyears, who could complain of that? Lady Fawn, however, had--not\ncomplained, but just said a word. A word in season, how good is\nit? Lucy did not much regard the word spoken to herself; but\nwhen she reflected that a word must also have been spoken to Mr.\nGreystock,--otherwise how should it have been that he never came\nagain?--that she did not like.\n\nIn herself she regarded this passion of hers as a healthy man regards\nthe loss of a leg or an arm. It is a great nuisance, a loss that\nmaims the whole life,--a misfortune to be much regretted. But because\na leg is gone, everything is not gone. A man with a wooden leg may\nstump about through much action, and may enjoy the keenest pleasures\nof humanity. He has his eyes left to him, and his ears, and his\nintellect. He will not break his heart for the loss of that leg. And\nso it was with Lucy Morris. She would still stump about and be very\nactive. Eyes, ears, and intellect were left to her. Looking at her\nposition, she told herself that a happy love could hardly have been\nher lot in life. Lady Fawn, she thought, was right. A governess\nshould make up her mind to do without a lover. She had given away her\nheart, and yet she would do without a lover. When, on one dull, dark\nafternoon, as she was thinking of all this, Lord Fawn suddenly put\ninto her hands a cruelly long printed document respecting the Sawab,\nshe went to work upon it immediately. As she read it, she could not\nrefrain from thinking how wonderfully Frank Greystock would plead the\ncause of the Indian prince, if the privilege of pleading it could be\ngiven to him.\n\nThe spring had come round, with May and the London butterflies, at\nthe time at which our story begins, and during six months Frank\nGreystock had not been at Fawn Court. Then one day Lady Eustace came\ndown with her ponies, and her footman, and a new dear friend of hers,\nMiss Macnulty. While Miss Macnulty was being honoured by Lady Fawn,\nLizzie had retreated to a corner with her old dear friend Lucy\nMorris. It was pretty to see how so wealthy and fashionable a woman\nas Lady Eustace could show so much friendship to a governess. \"Have\nyou seen Frank, lately?\" said Lady Eustace, referring to her cousin\nthe barrister.\n\n\"Not for ever so long,\" said Lucy, with her cheeriest smile.\n\n\"He is not going to prove a false knight?\" asked Lady Eustace, in her\nlowest whisper.\n\n\"I don't know that Mr. Greystock is much given to knighthood at all,\"\nsaid Lucy,--\"unless it is to being made Sir Francis by his party.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, my dear; as if I didn't know. I suppose Lady Fawn has been\ninterfering--like an old cat as she is.\"\n\n\"She is not an old cat, Lizzie! and I won't hear her called so. If\nyou think so, you shouldn't come here. And she hasn't interfered.\nThat is, she has done nothing that she ought not to have done.\"\n\n\"Then she has interfered,\" said Lady Eustace, as she got up and\nwalked across the room, with a sweet smile to the old cat.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nFrank Greystock\n\n\nFrank Greystock the barrister was the only son of the Dean of\nBobsborough. Now the dean had a family of daughters,--not quite so\nnumerous indeed as that of Lady Fawn, for there were only three of\nthem,--and was by no means a rich man. Unless a dean have a private\nfortune, or has chanced to draw the happy lot of Durham in the\nlottery of deans, he can hardly be wealthy. At Bobsborough the dean\nwas endowed with a large, rambling, picturesque, uncomfortable house,\nand with \u00c2\u00a31,500 a year. In regard to personal property it may be\nasserted of all the Greystocks that they never had any. They were a\nfamily of which the males would surely come to be deans and admirals,\nand the females would certainly find husbands. And they lived on the\ngood things of the world, and mixed with wealthy people. But they\nnever had any money. The Eustaces always had money, and the Bishop of\nBobsborough was wealthy. The dean was a man very different from his\nbrother the admiral, who had never paid anybody anything. The dean\ndid pay; but he was a little slow in his payments, and money with\nhim was never very plentiful. In these circumstances it became very\nexpedient that Frank Greystock should earn his bread early in life.\n\nNevertheless, he had chosen a profession which is not often lucrative\nat first. He had been called to the Bar, and had gone,--and was still\ngoing,--the circuit in which lies the cathedral city of Bobsborough.\nBobsborough is not much of a town, and was honoured with the judges'\nvisits only every other circuit. Frank began pretty well, getting\nsome little work in London, and perhaps nearly enough to pay the cost\nof his circuit out of the county in which the cathedral was situated.\nBut he began life after that impecunious fashion for which the\nGreystocks have been noted. Tailors, robemakers, and booksellers\ngave him trust, and did believe that they would get their money. And\nany persistent tradesman did get it. He did not actually hoist the\nblack flag of impecuniosity, and proclaim his intention of preying\ngenerally upon the retail dealers, as his uncle the admiral had done.\nBut he became known as a young man with whom money was \"tight.\" All\nthis had been going on for three or four years before he had met Lucy\nMorris at the deanery. He was then eight-and-twenty, and had been\nfour years called. He was thirty when old Lady Fawn hinted to him\nthat he had better not pay any more visits at Fawn Court.\n\nBut things had much altered with him of late. At the time of that\nvisit to the deanery he had made a sudden start in his profession.\nThe Corporation of the City of London had brought an action against\nthe Bank of England with reference to certain alleged encroachments,\nof which action, considerable as it was in all its interests, no\nfurther notice need be taken here than is given by the statement\nthat a great deal of money in this cause had found its way among the\nlawyers. Some of it penetrated into the pocket of Frank Greystock;\nbut he earned more than money, better than money, out of that\naffair. It was attributed to him by the attorneys that the Bank\nof England was saved from the necessity of reconstructing all its\nbullion-cellars, and he had made his character for industry. In the\nyear after that the Bobsborough people were rather driven into a\ncorner in search of a clever young Conservative candidate for the\nborough, and Frank Greystock was invited to stand. It was not thought\nthat there was much chance of success, and the dean was against it.\nBut Frank liked the honour and glory of the contest, and so did\nFrank's mother. Frank Greystock stood, and at the time in which he\nwas warned away from Fawn Court had been nearly a year in Parliament.\n\"Of course it does interfere with one's business,\" he had said to his\nfather, \"but then it brings one business also. A man with a seat in\nParliament who shows that he means work will always get nearly as\nmuch work as he can do.\" Such was Frank's exposition to his father.\nIt may perhaps not be found to hold water in all cases. Mrs. Dean was\nof course delighted with her son's success, and so were the girls.\nWomen like to feel that the young men belonging to them are doing\nsomething in the world, so that a reflected glory may be theirs. It\nwas pleasant to talk of Frank as member for the city. Brothers do not\nalways care much for a brother's success, but a sister is generally\nsympathetic. If Frank would only marry money, there was nothing he\nmight not achieve. That he would live to sit on the woolsack was\nnow almost a certainty to the dear old lady. But in order that he\nmight sit there comfortably it was necessary that he should at least\nabstain from marrying a poor wife. For there was fear at the deanery\nalso in regard to Lucy Morris.\n\n\"That notion of marrying money as you call it,\" Frank said to his\nsecond sister Margaret, \"is the most disgusting idea in the world.\"\n\n\"It is as easy to love a girl who has something as one who has\nnothing,\" said Margaret.\n\n\"No,--it is not; because the girls with money are scarce, and those\nwithout it are plentiful,--an argument of which I don't suppose you\nsee the force.\" Then Margaret for the moment was snubbed and retired.\n\n\"Indeed, Frank, I think Lady Fawn was right,\" said the mother.\n\n\"And I think she was quite wrong. If there be anything in it, it\nwon't be expelled by Lady Fawn's interference. Do you think I should\nallow Lady Fawn to tell me not to choose such or such a woman for my\nwife?\"\n\n\"It's the habit of seeing her, my dear. Nobody loves Lucy Morris\nbetter than I do. We all like her. But, dear Frank, would it do for\nyou to make her your wife?\"\n\nFrank Greystock was silent for a moment, and then he answered his\nmother's question. \"I am not quite sure whether it would or would\nnot. But I do think this--that if I were bold enough to marry now,\nand to trust all to the future, and could get Lucy to be my wife, I\nshould be doing a great thing. I doubt, however, whether I have the\ncourage.\" All of which made the dean's wife uneasy.\n\nThe reader, who has read so far, will perhaps think that Frank\nGreystock was in love with Lucy as Lucy was in love with him. But\nsuch was not exactly the case. To be in love, as an absolute,\nwell-marked, acknowledged fact, is the condition of a woman more\nfrequently and more readily than of a man. Such is not the common\ntheory on the matter, as it is the man's business to speak, and the\nwoman's business to be reticent. And the woman is presumed to have\nkept her heart free from any load of love, till she may accept the\nburthen with an assurance that it shall become a joy and a comfort to\nher. But such presumptions, though they may be very useful for the\nregulation of conduct, may not be always true. It comes more within\nthe scope of a woman's mind, than that of a man's, to think closely\nand decide sharply on such a matter. With a man it is often chance\nthat settles the question for him. He resolves to propose to a woman,\nor proposes without resolving, because she is close to him. Frank\nGreystock ridiculed the idea of Lady Fawn's interference in so high\na matter as his love,--or abstinence from love. Nevertheless, had\nhe been made a welcome guest at Fawn Court, he would undoubtedly\nhave told his love to Lucy Morris. He was not a welcome guest, but\nhad been banished; and, as a consequence of that banishment, he had\nformed no resolution in regard to Lucy, and did not absolutely know\nwhether she was necessary to him or not. But Lucy Morris knew all\nabout it.\n\nMoreover, it frequently happens with men that they fail to analyse\nthese things, and do not make out for themselves any clear definition\nof what their feelings are or what they mean. We hear that a man has\nbehaved badly to a girl, when the behaviour of which he has been\nguilty has resulted simply from want of thought. He has found a\ncertain companionship to be agreeable to him, and he has accepted\nthe pleasure without inquiry. Some vague idea has floated across\nhis brain that the world is wrong in supposing that such friendship\ncannot exist without marriage, or question of marriage. It is simply\nfriendship. And yet were his friend to tell him that she intended to\ngive herself in marriage elsewhere, he would suffer all the pangs\nof jealousy, and would imagine himself to be horribly ill-treated!\nTo have such a friend,--a friend whom he cannot or will not make\nhis wife,--is no injury to him. To him it is simply a delight, an\nexcitement in life, a thing to be known to himself only and not\ntalked of to others, a source of pride and inward exultation. It is\na joy to think of when he wakes, and a consolation in his little\ntroubles. It dispels the weariness of life, and makes a green spot of\nholiday within his daily work. It is, indeed, death to her;--but he\ndoes not know it. Frank Greystock did think that he could not marry\nLucy Morris without making an imprudent plunge into deep water, and\nyet he felt that Lady Fawn was an ill-natured old woman for hinting\nto him that he had better not, for the present, continue his visits\nto Fawn Court. \"Of course you understand me, Mr. Greystock,\" she had\nsaid, meaning to be civil. \"When Miss Morris has left us,--should she\never leave us,--I should be most happy to see you.\" \"What on earth\nwould take me to Fawn Court, if Lucy were not there!\" he said to\nhimself,--not choosing to appreciate Lady Fawn's civility.\n\nFrank Greystock was at this time nearly thirty years old. He was a\ngood-looking, but not strikingly handsome man; thin, of moderate\nheight, with sharp grey eyes, a face clean shorn with the exception\nof a small whisker, with wiry, strong dark hair, which was already\nbeginning to show a tinge of grey;--the very opposite in appearance\nto his late friend Sir Florian Eustace. He was quick, ready-witted,\nself-reliant, and not over scrupulous in the outward things of the\nworld. He was desirous of doing his duty to others, but he was\nspecially desirous that others should do their duty to him. He\nintended to get on in the world, and believed that happiness was to\nbe achieved by success. He was certainly made for the profession\nwhich he had adopted. His father, looking to certain morsels of\nChurch patronage which occasionally came in his way, and to the fact\nthat he and the bishop were on most friendly terms, had wished his\nson to take orders. But Frank had known himself and his own qualities\ntoo well to follow his father's advice. He had chosen to be a\nbarrister, and now, at thirty, he was in Parliament.\n\nHe had been asked to stand for Bobsborough in the Conservative\ninterest, and as a Conservative he had been returned. Those who\ninvited him knew probably but little of his own political beliefs or\nfeelings,--did not, probably, know whether he had any. His father was\na fine old Tory of the ancient school, who thought that things were\ngoing from bad to worse, but was able to live happily in spite of his\nanticipations. The dean was one of those old-world politicians,--we\nmeet them every day, and they are generally pleasant people,--who\nenjoy the politics of the side to which they belong without any\nspecial belief in them. If pressed hard they will almost own that\ntheir so-called convictions are prejudices. But not for worlds would\nthey be rid of them. When two or three of them meet together, they\nare as freemasons, who are bound by a pleasant bond which separates\nthem from the outer world. They feel among themselves that everything\nthat is being done is bad,--even though that everything is done by\ntheir own party. It was bad to interfere with Charles, bad to endure\nCromwell, bad to banish James, bad to put up with William. The House\nof Hanover was bad. All interference with prerogative has been bad.\nThe Reform bill was very bad. Encroachment on the estates of the\nbishops was bad. Emancipation of Roman Catholics was the worst of\nall. Abolition of corn-laws, church-rates, and oaths and tests were\nall bad. The meddling with the Universities has been grievous. The\ntreatment of the Irish Church has been Satanic. The overhauling of\nschools is most injurious to English education. Education bills and\nIrish land bills were all bad. Every step taken has been bad. And yet\nto them old England is of all countries in the world the best to live\nin, and is not at all the less comfortable because of the changes\nthat have been made. These people are ready to grumble at every boon\nconferred on them, and yet to enjoy every boon. They know, too, their\nprivileges, and, after a fashion, understand their position. It is\npicturesque, and it pleases them. To have been always in the right\nand yet always on the losing side; always being ruined, always under\npersecution from a wild spirit of republican-demagogism,--and yet\nnever to lose anything, not even position or public esteem, is\npleasant enough. A huge, living, daily increasing grievance that does\none no palpable harm, is the happiest possession that a man can have.\nThere is a large body of such men in England, and, personally, they\nare the very salt of the nation. He who said that all Conservatives\nare stupid did not know them. Stupid Conservatives there may\nbe,--and there certainly are very stupid Radicals. The well-educated,\nwidely-read Conservative, who is well assured that all good things\nare gradually being brought to an end by the voice of the people,\nis generally the pleasantest man to be met. But he is a Buddhist,\npossessing a religious creed which is altogether dark and mysterious\nto the outer world. Those who watch the ways of the advanced Buddhist\nhardly know whether the man does believe himself in his hidden god,\nbut men perceive that he is respectable, self-satisfied, and a man\nof note. It is of course from the society of such that Conservative\ncandidates are to be sought; but, alas, it is hard to indoctrinate\nyoung minds with the old belief, since new theories of life have\nbecome so rife!\n\nNevertheless Frank Greystock, when he was invited to stand for\nBobsborough in the Conservative interest, had not for a moment\nallowed any political heterodoxy on his own part to stand in the way\nof his advancement. It may, perhaps, be the case that a barrister is\nless likely to be influenced by personal convictions in taking his\nside in politics than any other man who devotes himself to public\naffairs. No slur on the profession is intended by this suggestion. A\nbusy, clever, useful man, who has been at work all his life, finds\nthat his own progress towards success demands from him that he shall\nbecome a politician. The highest work of a lawyer can only be reached\nthrough political struggle. As a large-minded man of the world,\npeculiarly conversant with the fact that every question has two\nsides, and that as much may often be said on one side as on the\nother, he has probably not become violent in his feelings as a\npolitical partisan. Thus he sees that there is an opening here or an\nopening there, and the offence in either case is not great to him.\nWith Frank Greystock the matter was very easy. There certainly was no\napostasy. He had now and again attacked his father's ultra-Toryism,\nand rebuked his mother and sisters when they spoke of Gladstone as\nApollyon, and called John Bright the Abomination of Desolation. But\nit was easy to him to fancy himself a Conservative, and as such he\ntook his seat in the House without any feeling of discomfort.\n\nDuring the first four months of his first session he had not\nspoken,--but he had made himself useful. He had sat on one or two\nCommittees, though as a barrister he might have excused himself, and\nhad done his best to learn the forms of the House. But he had already\nbegun to find that the time which he devoted to Parliament was much\nwanted for his profession. Money was very necessary to him. Then a\nnew idea was presented to him.\n\nJohn Eustace and Greystock were very intimate,--as also had been Sir\nFlorian and Greystock. \"I tell you what I wish you'd do, Greystock,\"\nEustace said to him one day, as they were standing idly together in\nthe lobby of the House. For John Eustace was also in Parliament.\n\n\"Anything to oblige you, my friend.\"\n\n\"It's only a trifle,\" said Eustace. \"Just to marry your cousin, my\nbrother's widow.\"\n\n\"By Jove,--I wish I had the chance!\"\n\n\"I don't see why you shouldn't. She is sure to marry somebody, and\nat her age so she ought. She's not twenty-three yet. We could trust\nyou,--with the child and all the rest of it. As it is, she is giving\nus a deal of trouble.\"\n\n\"But, my dear fellow--\"\n\n\"I know she's fond of you. You were dining there last Sunday.\n\n\"And so was Fawn. Lord Fawn is the man to marry Lizzie. You see if he\ndoesn't. He was uncommonly sweet on her the other night, and really\ninterested her about the Sawab.\"\n\n\"She'll never be Lady Fawn,\" said John Eustace. \"And to tell the\ntruth, I shouldn't care to have to deal with Lord Fawn. He would\nbe infinitely troublesome; and I can hardly wash my hands of her\naffairs. She's worth nearly \u00c2\u00a35,000 a year as long as she lives, and\nI really don't think that she's much amiss.\"\n\n\"Much amiss! I don't know whether she's not the prettiest woman I\never saw,\" said Greystock.\n\n\"Yes;--but I mean in conduct, and all that. She is making herself\nqueer; and Camperdown, our lawyer, means to jump upon her; but it's\nonly because she doesn't know what she ought to be at, and what she\nought not. You could tell her.\"\n\n\"It wouldn't suit me at all to have to quarrel with Camperdown,\" said\nthe barrister, laughing.\n\n\"You and he would settle everything in five minutes, and it would\nsave me a world of trouble,\" said Eustace.\n\n\"Fawn is your man;--take my word for it,\" said Greystock, as he\nwalked back into the House.\n\n     *     *     *     *     *\n\nDramatists, when they write their plays, have a delightful privilege\nof prefixing a list of their personages;--and the dramatists of old\nused to tell us who was in love with whom, and what were the blood\nrelationships of all the persons. In such a narrative as this, any\nproceeding of that kind would be unusual,--and therefore the poor\nnarrator has been driven to expend his first four chapters in the\nmere task of introducing his characters. He regrets the length of\nthese introductions, and will now begin at once the action of his\nstory.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nThe Eustace Necklace\n\n\nJohn Eustace, Lady Eustace's brother-in-law, had told his friend\nGreystock, the lady's cousin, that Mr. Camperdown the lawyer intended\nto \"jump upon\" that lady. Making such allowance and deduction from\nthe force of these words as the slang expression requires, we may say\nthat John Eustace was right. Mr. Camperdown was in earnest, and did\nintend to obtain the restoration of those jewels. Mr. Camperdown\nwas a gentleman of about sixty, who had been lawyer to Sir\nFlorian's father, and whose father had been lawyer to Sir Florian's\ngrandfather. His connexion with the property and with the family\nwas of a nature to allow him to take almost any liberty with the\nEustaces. When therefore John Eustace, in regard to those diamonds,\nhad pleaded that the heir in his long minority would obtain ample\nmeans of buying more diamonds, and of suggesting that the plunder for\nthe sake of tranquillity should be allowed, Mr. Camperdown took upon\nhimself to say that he'd \"be ---- if he'd put up with it!\" \"I really\ndon't know what you are to do,\" said John Eustace.\n\n\"I'll file a bill in Chancery if it's necessary,\" said the old\nlawyer. \"Heaven on earth! as trustee how are you to reconcile\nyourself to such a robbery? They represent \u00c2\u00a3500 a year for ever, and\nshe is to have them simply because she chooses to take them!\"\n\n\"I suppose Florian could have given them away. At any rate he could\nhave sold them.\"\n\n\"I don't know that,\" said Mr. Camperdown. \"I have not looked as yet,\nbut I think that this necklace has been made an heirloom. At any rate\nit represents an amount of property that shouldn't and couldn't be\nmade over legally without some visible evidence of transfer. It's\nas clear a case of stealing as I ever knew in my life, and as bad\na case. She hadn't a farthing, and she has got the whole of the\nAyrshire property for her life. She goes about and tells everybody\nthat it's hers to sell to-morrow if she pleases to sell it! No,\nJohn;--\" Mr. Camperdown had known Eustace when he was a boy, and had\nwatched him become a man, and hadn't yet learned to drop the name by\nwhich he had called the boy,--\"we mustn't allow it. What do you think\nof her applying to me for an income to support her child,--a baby not\nyet two years old?\" Mr. Camperdown had been very adverse to all the\ncircumstances of Sir Florian's marriage, and had subjected himself to\nSir Florian's displeasure for expressing his opinion. He had tried to\nexplain that as the lady brought no money into the family she was not\nentitled to such a jointure as Sir Florian was determined to lavish\nupon her. But Sir Florian had been obstinate,--both in regard to the\nsettlement and the will. It was not till after Sir Florian's death\nthat this terrible matter of the jewels had even suggested itself to\nMr. Camperdown. The jewellers in whose custody the things had been\nsince the death of the late Lady Eustace had mentioned the affair to\nhim immediately on the young widow's return from Naples. Sir Florian\nhad withdrawn, not all the jewels, but by far the most valuable of\nthem, from the jewellers' care on his return to London from their\nmarriage tour to Scotland, and this was the result. The jewellers\nwere at that time without any doubt as to the date at which the\nnecklace was taken from them.\n\nMr. Camperdown's first attempt was made by a most courteous and even\ncomplimentary note, in which he suggested to Lady Eustace that it\nwould be for the advantage of all parties that the family jewels\nshould be kept together. Lizzie as she read this note smiled, and\nsaid to herself that she did not exactly see how her own interests\nwould be best served by such an arrangement. She made no answer to\nMr. Camperdown's note. Some months after this, when the heir was\nborn, and as Lady Eustace was passing through London on her journey\nfrom Bobsborough to Portray, a meeting had been arranged between her\nand Mr. Camperdown. She had endeavoured by all the wiles she knew to\navoid this meeting, but it had been forced upon her. She had been\nalmost given to understand that unless she submitted to it, she would\nnot be able to draw her income from the Portray property. Messrs.\nMowbray and Mopus had advised her to submit. \"My husband gave me a\nnecklace, and they want me to give it back,\" she had said to Mr.\nMopus. \"Do nothing of the kind,\" Mr. Mopus had replied. \"If you find\nit necessary, refer Mr. Camperdown to us. We will answer him.\" The\ninterview had taken place, during which Mr. Camperdown took the\ntrouble to explain very plainly and more than once that the income\nfrom the Portray property belonged to Lady Eustace for her life\nonly. It would after her death be rejoined, of necessity, to the\nrest of the Eustace property. This was repeated to Lady Eustace\nin the presence of John Eustace; but she made no remark on being\nso informed. \"You understand the nature of the settlement, Lady\nEustace?\" Mr. Camperdown had said. \"I believe I understand\neverything,\" she replied. Then, just at the close of the interview,\nhe asked a question about the jewels. Lady Eustace at first made no\nreply. \"They might as well be sent back to Messrs. Garnett's,\" said\nMr. Camperdown. \"I don't know that I have any to send back,\" she\nanswered; and then she escaped before Mr. Camperdown was able to\narrange any further attack. \"I can manage with her better by letter\nthan I can personally,\" he said to John Eustace.\n\nLawyers such as Mr. Camperdown are slow, and it was three or four\nmonths after that when he wrote a letter in his own name to Lady\nEustace, explaining to her, still courteously, that it was his\nbusiness to see that the property of the Eustace family was placed in\nfit hands, and that a certain valuable necklace of diamonds, which\nwas an heirloom of the family, and which was undeniably the property\nof the heir, was believed to be in her custody. As such property was\npeculiarly subject to risks, would she have the kindness to make\narrangements for handing over the necklace to the custody of the\nMessrs. Garnett? To this letter Lizzie made no answer whatever, nor\ndid she to a second note, calling attention to the first. When John\nEustace told Greystock that Camperdown intended to \"jump on\" Lady\nEustace, the following further letter had been written by the\nfirm;--but up to that time Lizzie had not replied to it:\n\n\n   62, New Square, Lincoln's Inn,\n   May 5, 186--.\n\n   MADAM,\n\n   It is our duty as attorneys acting on behalf of the estate\n   of your late husband Sir Florian Eustace, and in the\n   interest of your son, his heir, to ask for restitution\n   of a certain valuable diamond necklace which is believed\n   to be now in the possession of your ladyship. Our senior\n   partner, Mr. Camperdown, has written to your ladyship more\n   than once on the subject, but has not been honoured with\n   any reply. Doubtless had there been any mistake as to\n   the necklace being in your hands we should have been\n   so informed. The diamonds were withdrawn from Messrs.\n   Garnett's, the jewellers, by Sir Florian soon after his\n   marriage, and were, no doubt, entrusted to your keeping.\n   They are appanages of the family which should not be in\n   your hands as the widow of the late baronet, and they\n   constitute an amount of property which certainly cannot\n   be alienated from the family without inquiry or right, as\n   might any trifling article either of use or ornament. The\n   jewels are valued at over \u00c2\u00a310,000.\n\n   We are reluctantly compelled, by the fact of your having\n   left unanswered three letters from Mr. Camperdown, Senior,\n   on the subject, to explain to you that if attention be\n   not paid to this letter, we shall be obliged, in the\n   performance of our duty, to take legal steps for the\n   restitution of the property.\n\n   We have the honour to be,\n   Madam,\n   Your ladyship's most obedient servants,\n\n   CAMPERDOWN & SON.\n\n   To Lady Eustace.\n   &c. &c.\n\n\nA few days after it was sent old Mr. Camperdown got the letter-book\nof the office and read the letter to John Eustace.\n\n\"I don't see how you're to get them,\" said Eustace.\n\n\"We'll throw upon her the burthen of showing that they have become\nlegally her property. She can't do it.\"\n\n\"Suppose she sold them?\"\n\n\"We'll follow them up. \u00c2\u00a310,000, my dear John! God bless my soul! it's\na magnificent dowry for a daughter,--an ample provision for a younger\nson. And she is to be allowed to filch it, as other widows filch\nchina cups, and a silver teaspoon or two! It's quite a common thing,\nbut I never heard of such a haul as this.\"\n\n\"It will be very unpleasant,\" said Eustace.\n\n\"And then she still goes about everywhere declaring that the Portray\nproperty is her own. She's a bad lot. I knew it from the first. Of\ncourse we shall have trouble.\" Then Mr. Eustace explained to the\nlawyer that their best way out of it all would be to get the widow\nmarried to some respectable husband. She was sure to marry sooner or\nlater,--so John Eustace said,--and any \"decently decent\" fellow would\nbe easier to deal with than she herself. \"He must be very indecently\nindecent if he is not,\" said Mr. Camperdown. But Mr. Eustace did not\nname Frank Greystock the barrister as the probable future decent\nhusband.\n\nWhen Lizzie first got the letter, which she did on the day after the\nvisit at Fawn Court of which mention has been made, she put it by\nunread for a couple of days. She opened it, not knowing the clerk's\nhandwriting, but read only the first line and the signature. For two\ndays she went on with the ordinary affairs and amusements of her\nlife, as though no such letter had reached her; but she was thinking\nof it all the time. The diamonds were in her possession, and she had\nhad them valued by her old friend Mr. Benjamin--of the firm of Harter\nand Benjamin. Mr. Benjamin had suggested that stones of such a value\nshould not be left to the risk of an ordinary London house; but\nLizzie had felt that if Mr. Benjamin got them into his hands, Mr.\nBenjamin might perhaps not return them. Messrs. Camperdown and\nGarnett between them might form a league with Mr. Benjamin. Where\nwould she be, should Mr. Benjamin tell her that under some legal\nsanction he had given the jewels up to Mr. Camperdown? She hinted\nto Mr. Benjamin that she would perhaps sell them if she got a good\noffer. Mr. Benjamin, who was very familiar with her, hinted that\nthere might be a little family difficulty. \"Oh, none in the least,\"\nsaid Lizzie;--\"but I don't think I shall part with them.\" Then she\ngave Mr. Benjamin an order for a strong box, which was supplied to\nher. The strong box, which was so heavy that she could barely lift it\nherself, was now in her London bedroom.\n\nOn the morning of the third day she read the letter. Miss Macnulty\nwas staying with her, but she had not said a word to Miss Macnulty\nabout the letter. She read it up in her own bedroom, and then sat\ndown to think about it. Sir Florian, as he had handed to her the\nstones for the purpose of a special dinner party which had been\ngiven to them when passing through London, had told her that they\nwere family jewels. \"That setting was done for my mother,\" he said,\n\"but it is already old. When we are at home again they shall be\nreset.\" Then he had added some little husband's joke as to a future\ndaughter-in-law who should wear them. Nevertheless she was not sure\nwhether the fact of their being so handed to her did not make them\nher own. She had spoken a second time to Mr. Mopus, and Mr. Mopus had\nasked her whether there existed any family deed as to the diamonds.\nShe had heard of no such deed, nor did Mr. Camperdown mention such a\ndeed. After reading the letter once she read it a dozen times; and\nthen, like a woman, made up her mind that her safest course would be\nnot to answer it.\n\nBut yet she felt sure that something unpleasant would come of it. Mr.\nCamperdown was not a man to take up such a question and to let it\ndrop. Legal steps! What did legal steps mean, and what could they do\nto her? Would Mr. Camperdown be able to put her in prison,--or to\ntake away from her the estate of Portray? She could swear that her\nhusband had given them to her, and could invent any form of words\nshe pleased as accompanying the gift. No one else had been near them\nthen. But she was, and felt herself to be absolutely, alarmingly\nignorant, not only of the laws, but of custom in such matters.\nMessrs. Mowbray and Mopus and Mr. Benjamin were the allies to whom\nshe looked for guidance; but she was wise enough to know that\nMowbray and Mopus, and Harter and Benjamin were not trustworthy,\nwhereas Camperdown and Son and the Messrs. Garnett were all\nas firm as rocks and as respectable as the Bank of England.\nCircumstances,--unfortunate circumstances,--drove her to Harter and\nBenjamin and to Mowbray and Mopus, while she would have taken so much\ndelight in feeling the strong honesty of the other people to be on\nher side! She would have talked to her friends about Mr. Camperdown\nand the people at Garnett's with so much satisfaction! But ease,\nsecurity, and even respectability may be bought too dearly. Ten\nthousand pounds! Was she prepared to surrender such a sum as that?\nShe had, indeed, already realised the fact that it might be very\ndifficult to touch the money. When she had suggested to Mr. Benjamin\nthat he should buy the jewels, that worthy tradesman had by no means\njumped at the offer. Of what use to her would be a necklace always\nlocked up in an iron box, which box, for aught she knew, myrmidons\nfrom Mr. Camperdown might carry off during her absence from the\nhouse? Would it not be better to come to terms and surrender? But\nthen what should the terms be?\n\nIf only there had been a friend whom she could consult; a friend\nwhom she could consult on a really friendly footing!--not a simply\nrespectable, off-handed, high-minded friend, who would advise her as\na matter of course to make restitution. Her uncle the dean, or her\ncousin Frank, or old Lady Fawn, would be sure to give her such advice\nas that. There are people who are so very high-minded when they have\nto deal with the interests of their friends! What if she were to ask\nLord Fawn?\n\nThoughts of a second marriage had, of course, crossed Lady Eustace's\nmind, and they were by no means the worst thoughts that found a place\nthere. She had a grand idea,--this selfish, hard-fisted little woman,\nwho could not bring herself to abandon the plunder on which she had\nlaid her hand,--a grand idea of surrendering herself and all her\npossessions to a great passion. For Florian Eustace she had never\ncared. She had sat down by his side, and looked into his handsome\nface, and read poetry to him,--because of his wealth, and because\nit had been indispensable to her to settle herself well. And he had\nbeen all very well,--a generous, open-hearted, chivalrous, irascible,\nbut rather heavy-minded gentleman; but she had never been in love\nwith him. Now she desired to be so in love that she could surrender\neverything to her love. There was as yet nothing of such love in her\nbosom. She had seen no one who had so touched her. But she was alive\nto the romance of the thing, and was in love with the idea of being\nin love. \"Ah,\" she would say to herself in her moments of solitude,\n\"if I had a Corsair of my own, how I would sit on watch for my\nlover's boat by the sea-shore!\" And she believed it of herself, that\nshe could do so.\n\nBut it would also be very nice to be a peeress,--so that she might,\nwithout any doubt, be one of the great ladies of London. As a\nbaronet's widow with a large income, she was already almost a great\nlady; but she was quite alive to a suspicion that she was not\naltogether strong in her position. The bishop's people and the dean's\npeople did not quite trust her. The Camperdowns and Garnetts utterly\ndistrusted her. The Mopuses and Benjamins were more familiar than\nthey would be with a really great lady. She was sharp enough to\nunderstand all this. Should it be Lord Fawn or should it be a\nCorsair? The worst of Lord Fawn was the undoubted fact that he was\nnot himself a great man. He could, no doubt, make his wife a peeress;\nbut he was poor, encumbered with a host of sisters, dull as a\nblue-book, and possessed of little beyond his peerage to recommend\nhim. If she could only find a peer, unmarried, with a dash of the\nCorsair about him! In the meantime, what was she to do about the\njewels?\n\nThere was staying with her at this time a certain Miss Macnulty, who\nwas related, after some distant fashion, to old Lady Linlithgow, and\nwho was as utterly destitute of possessions or means of existence\nas any unfortunate, well-born, and moderately-educated, middle-aged\nwoman in London. To live upon her friends, such as they might be,\nwas the only mode of life within her reach. It was not that she had\nchosen such dependence; nor, indeed, had she endeavoured to reject\nit. It had come to her as a matter of course,--either that or the\npoor-house. As to earning her bread, except by that attendance which\na poor friend gives,--the idea of any possibility that way had never\nentered her head. She could do nothing,--except dress like a lady\nwith the smallest possible cost, and endeavour to be obliging.\nNow, at this moment, her condition was terribly precarious. She\nhad quarrelled with Lady Linlithgow, and had been taken in by\nher old friend Lizzie,--her old enemy might, perhaps, be a truer\nexpression,--because of that quarrel. But a permanent home had not\neven been promised to her; and poor Miss Macnulty was aware that even\na permanent home with Lady Eustace would not be an unmixed blessing.\nIn her way, Miss Macnulty was an honest woman.\n\nThey were sitting together one May afternoon in the little back\ndrawing-room in Mount Street. They had dined early, were now drinking\ntea, and intended to go to the opera. It was six o'clock, and was\nstill broad day, but the thick coloured blind was kept across the\nsingle window, and the folding doors of the room were nearly closed,\nand there was a feeling of evening in the room. The necklace during\nthe whole day had been so heavy on Lizzie's heart, that she had been\nunable to apply her thoughts to the building of that castle in the\nair in which the Corsair was to reign supreme, but not alone. \"My\ndear,\" she said,--she generally called Miss Macnulty my dear,--\"you\nknow that box I had made by the jewellers.\"\n\n\"You mean the safe.\"\n\n\"Well,--yes; only it isn't a safe. A safe is a great big thing. I had\nit made especially for the diamonds Sir Florian gave me.\"\n\n\"I supposed it was so.\"\n\n\"I wonder whether there's any danger about it?\"\n\n\"If I were you, Lady Eustace, I wouldn't keep them in the house. I\nshould have them kept where Sir Florian kept them. Suppose anybody\nshould come and murder you!\"\n\n\"I'm not a bit afraid of that,\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"I should be. And what will you do with it when you go to Scotland?\"\n\n\"I took them with me before;--in my own care. I know that wasn't\nsafe. I wish I knew what to do with them!\"\n\n\"There are people who keep such things,\" said Miss Macnulty.\n\nThen Lizzie paused a moment. She was dying for counsel and for\nconfidence. \"I cannot trust them anywhere,\" she said. \"It is just\npossible there may be a lawsuit about them.\"\n\n\"How a lawsuit?\"\n\n\"I cannot explain it all, but I am very unhappy about it. They want\nme to give them up;--but my husband gave them to me, and for his\nsake I will not do so. When he threw them round my neck he told me\nthat they were my own;--so he did. How can a woman give up such a\npresent,--from a husband,--who is dead? As to the value, I care\nnothing. But I won't do it.\" By this time Lady Eustace was in tears,\nand had so far succeeded as to have produced some amount of belief in\nMiss Macnulty's mind.\n\n\"If they are your own, they can't take them from you,\" said Miss\nMacnulty.\n\n\"They sha'n't. They shall find that I've got some spirit left.\" Then\nshe reflected that a real Corsair lover would protect her jewels\nfor her;--would guard them against a score of Camperdowns. But she\ndoubted whether Lord Fawn would do much in that way. Then the door\nwas opened, and Lord Fawn was announced. It was not at all unusual\nwith Lord Fawn to call on the widow at this hour. Mount Street is not\nexactly in the way from the India Office to the House of Lords; but\na Hansom cab can make it almost in the way. Of neglect of official\nduty Lord Fawn was never guilty; but a half hour for private business\nor for relaxation between one stage of duty and another,--can any\nMinister grudge so much to an indefatigable follower? Lady Eustace\nhad been in tears as he was announced, but the light of the room was\nso low that the traces of them could hardly be seen. She was in her\nCorsair state of mind, divided between her jewels and her poetry, and\ncaring not very much for the increased rank which Lord Fawn could\ngive her. \"The Sawab's case is coming on in the House of Commons this\nvery night,\" he said, in answer to a question from Miss Macnulty.\nThen he turned to Lady Eustace. \"Your cousin, Mr. Greystock, is going\nto ask a question in the House.\"\n\n\"Shall you be there to answer him?\" asked Miss Macnulty innocently.\n\n\"Oh dear, no. But I shall be present. A peer can go, you know.\"\nThen Lord Fawn, at considerable length, explained to the two ladies\nthe nature and condition of the British Parliament. Miss Macnulty\nexperienced an innocent pleasure in having such things told to her by\na lord. Lady Eustace knew that this was the way in which Lord Fawn\nmade love, and thought that from him it was as good as any other way.\nIf she were to marry a second time simply with the view of being a\npeeress, of having a respected husband, and making good her footing\nin the world, she would as lief listen to parliamentary details and\nthe prospects of the Sawab as to any other matters. She knew very\nwell that no Corsair propensities would be forthcoming from Lord\nFawn. Lord Fawn had just worked himself round to the Sawab again,\nwhen Frank Greystock entered the room. \"Now we have both the Houses\nrepresented,\" said Lady Eustace, as she welcomed her cousin.\n\n\"You intend to ask your question about the Sawab to-night?\" asked\nLord Fawn, with intense interest, feeling that, had it been his lot\nto perform that task before he went to his couch, he would at this\nmoment have been preparing his little speech.\n\nBut Frank Greystock had not come to his cousin's house to talk of\nthe Prince of the Mygawb territory. When his friend Eustace had\nsuggested to him that he should marry the widow, he had ridiculed\nthe idea;--but nevertheless he had thought of it a good deal. He was\nstruggling hard, working diligently, making for himself a character\nin Parliament, succeeding,--so said all his friends,--as a barrister.\nHe was a rising young man, one of those whose names began to be much\nin the mouths of other men;--but still he was poor. It seemed to\nhimself that among other good gifts that of economy had not been\nbestowed upon him. He owed a little money, and though he owed it,\nhe went on spending his earnings. He wanted just such a lift in the\nworld as a wife with an income would give him. As for looking about\nfor a girl whom he could honestly love, and who should have a fortune\nof her own as well as beauty, birth, and all the other things,--that\nwas out of his reach. If he talked to himself of love, if he were\never to acknowledge to himself that love was to have sway over him,\nthen must Lucy Morris be the mistress of his heart. He had come to\nknow enough about himself to be aware of that;--but he knew also\nthat he had said nothing binding him to walk in that path. It was\nquite open to him to indulge a discreet ambition without dishonour.\nTherefore he also had come to call upon the beautiful widow. The\ncourtship with her he knew need not be long. He could ask her to\nmarry him to-morrow,--as for that matter to-day,--without a feeling\nof hesitation. She might accept him or might reject him; but, as he\nsaid to himself, in neither case would any harm be done.\n\nAn idea of the same kind flitted across Lizzie's mind as she sat\nand talked to the two gentlemen. She knew that her cousin Frank was\npoor, but she thought that she could fall in love with him. He was\nnot exactly a Corsair;--but he was a man who had certain Corsair\npropensities. He was bold and dashing, unscrupulous and clever, a man\nto make a name for himself, and one to whom a woman could endure to\nbe obedient. There could be no question as to choice between him and\nLord Fawn, if she were to allow herself to choose by liking. And she\nthought that Frank Greystock would keep the necklace, if he himself\nwere made to have an interest in the necklace; whereas Lord Fawn\nwould undoubtedly surrender it at once to Mr. Camperdown.\n\nLord Fawn had some slight idea of waiting to see the cousin go; but\nas Greystock had a similar idea, and as he was the stronger of the\ntwo, of course Lord Fawn went. He perhaps remembered that the Hansom\ncab was at the door,--costing sixpence every fifteen minutes,--and\nthat he wished to show himself in the House of Lords before the peers\nrose. Miss Macnulty also left the room, and Frank was alone with the\nwidow. \"Lizzie,\" said he, \"you must be very solitary here.\"\n\n\"I am solitary.\"\n\n\"And hardly happy.\"\n\n\"Anything but happy, Frank. I have things that make me very\nunhappy;--one thing that I will tell you if you will let me.\" Frank\nhad almost made up his mind to ask her on the spot to give him\npermission to console all her sorrows, when there came a clattering\ndouble-knock at the door. \"They know I shall be at home to nobody\nelse now,\" said Lady Eustace. But Frank Greystock had hardly regained\nhis self-possession when Miss Macnulty hurried into the room, and,\nwith a look almost of horror, declared that Lady Linlithgow was in\nthe parlour.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nLady Linlithgow's Mission\n\n\n\"Lady Linlithgow!\"--said Frank Greystock, holding up both his hands.\n\n\"Yes, indeed!\" said Miss Macnulty. \"I did not speak to her, but I saw\nher. She has sent her--love to Lady Eustace, and begs that she will\nsee her.\"\n\nLady Eustace had been so surprised by the announcement that hitherto\nshe had not spoken a word. The quarrel between her and her aunt\nhad been of such a nature that it had seemed to be impossible that\nthe old countess should come to Mount Street. Lizzie had certainly\nbehaved very badly to her aunt;--about as badly as a young woman\ncould behave to an old woman. She had accepted bread, and shelter,\nand the very clothes on her back from her aunt's bounty, and had\nrejected even the hand of her benefactress the first moment that she\nhad bread, and shelter, and clothes of her own. And here was Lady\nLinlithgow down-stairs in the parlour, and sending up her love to her\nniece! \"I won't see her!\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"You had better see her,\" said Frank.\n\n\"I can't see her!\" said Lizzie. \"Good gracious, my dear--what has she\ncome for?\"\n\n\"She says it's very important,\" said Miss Macnulty.\n\n\"Of course you must see her,\" said Frank. \"Let me get out of the\nhouse, and then tell the servant to show her up at once. Don't be\nweak now, Lizzie, and I'll come and find out all about it to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Mind you do,\" said Lizzie. Then Frank took his departure, and Lizzie\ndid as she was bidden. \"You remain in here, Julia,\" she said,--\"so as\nto be near if I want you. She shall come into the front room.\" Then,\nabsolutely shaking with fear of the approaching evil, she took her\nseat in the largest drawing-room. There was still a little delay.\nTime was given to Frank Greystock to get away, and to do so without\nmeeting Lady Linlithgow in the passage. The message was conveyed by\nMiss Macnulty to the servant, and the same servant opened the front\ndoor for Frank before he delivered it. Lady Linlithgow, too, though\nvery strong, was old. She was slow, or perhaps it might more properly\nbe said she was stately in her movements. She was one of those old\nwomen who are undoubtedly old women,--who in the remembrance of\nyounger people seem always to have been old women,--but on whom old\nage appears to have no debilitating effects. If the hand of Lady\nLinlithgow ever trembled, it trembled from anger;--if her foot ever\nfaltered, it faltered for effect. In her way Lady Linlithgow was\na very powerful human being. She knew nothing of fear, nothing of\ncharity, nothing of mercy, and nothing of the softness of love. She\nhad no imagination. She was worldly, covetous, and not unfrequently\ncruel. But she meant to be true and honest, though she often failed\nin her meaning;--and she had an idea of her duty in life. She was not\nself-indulgent. She was as hard as an oak post,--but then she was\nalso as trustworthy. No human being liked her;--but she had the good\nword of a great many human beings. At great cost to her own comfort\nshe had endeavoured to do her duty to her niece, Lizzie Greystock,\nwhen Lizzie was homeless. Undoubtedly Lizzie's bed, while it had been\nspread under her aunt's roof, had not been one of roses; but such as\nit had been, she had endured to occupy it while it served her needs.\nShe had constrained herself to bear her aunt;--but from the moment\nof her escape she had chosen to reject her aunt altogether. Now her\naunt's heavy step was heard upon the stairs! Lizzie also was a brave\nwoman after a certain fashion. She could dare to incur a great danger\nfor an adequate object. But she was too young as yet to have become\nmistress of that persistent courage which was Lady Linlithgow's\npeculiar possession.\n\nWhen the countess entered the drawing-room Lizzie rose upon her\nlegs, but did not come forward from her chair. The old woman was not\ntall;--but her face was long, and at the same time large, square\nat the chin and square at the forehead, and gave her almost an\nappearance of height. Her nose was very prominent, not beaked, but\nstraight and strong, and broad at the bridge, and of a dark-red\ncolour. Her eyes were sharp and grey. Her mouth was large, and over\nit there was almost beard enough for a young man's moustache. Her\nchin was firm, and large, and solid. Her hair was still brown, and\nwas only just grizzled in parts. Nothing becomes an old woman like\ngrey hair, but Lady Linlithgow's hair would never be grey. Her\nappearance on the whole was not pre-possessing, but it gave one\nan idea of honest, real strength. What one saw was not buckram,\nwhalebone, paint, and false hair. It was all human,--hardly\nfeminine, certainly not angelic, with perhaps a hint in the other\ndirection,--but a human body, and not a thing of pads and patches.\nLizzie, as she saw her aunt, made up her mind for the combat. Who is\nthere that has lived to be a man or woman, and has not experienced\na moment in which a combat has impended, and a call for such sudden\ncourage has been necessary? Alas!--sometimes the combat comes, and\nthe courage is not there. Lady Eustace was not at her ease as she saw\nher aunt enter the room. \"Oh, come ye in peace, or come ye in war?\"\nshe would have said had she dared. Her aunt had sent up her love,--if\nthe message had been delivered aright; but what of love could there\nbe between the two? The countess dashed at once to the matter in\nhand, making no allusion to Lizzie's ungrateful conduct to herself.\n\"Lizzie,\" she said, \"I've been asked to come to you by Mr.\nCamperdown. I'll sit down, if you please.\"\n\n\"Oh, certainly, Aunt Penelope. Mr. Camperdown!\"\n\n\"Yes;--Mr. Camperdown. You know who he is. He has been with me\nbecause I am your nearest relation. So I am, and therefore I have\ncome. I don't like it, I can tell you.\"\n\n\"As for that, Aunt Penelope, you've done it to please yourself,\" said\nLizzie, in a tone of insolence with which Lady Linlithgow had been\nfamiliar in former days.\n\n\"No, I haven't, miss. I haven't come for my own pleasure at all.\nI have come for the credit of the family, if any good can be done\ntowards saving it. You've got your husband's diamonds locked up\nsomewhere, and you must give them back.\"\n\n\"My husband's diamonds were my diamonds,\" said Lizzie stoutly.\n\n\"They are family diamonds, Eustace diamonds, heirlooms,--old property\nbelonging to the Eustaces, just like their estates. Sir Florian\ndidn't give 'em away, and couldn't, and wouldn't if he could. Such\nthings ain't given away in that fashion. It's all nonsense, and you\nmust give them up.\"\n\n\"Who says so?\"\n\n\"I say so.\"\n\n\"That's nothing, Aunt Penelope.\"\n\n\"Nothing, is it? You'll see. Mr. Camperdown says so. All the world\nwill say so. If you don't take care, you'll find yourself brought\ninto a court of law, my dear, and a jury will say so. That's what it\nwill come to. What good will they do you? You can't sell them;--and\nas a widow you can't wear 'em. If you marry again, you wouldn't\ndisgrace your husband by going about showing off the Eustace\ndiamonds! But you don't know anything about 'proper feelings.'\"\n\n\"I know every bit as much as you do, Aunt Penelope, and I don't want\nyou to teach me.\"\n\n\"Will you give up the jewels to Mr. Camperdown?\"\n\n\"No--I won't.\"\n\n\"Or to the jewellers?\"\n\n\"No; I won't. I mean to--keep them--for--my child.\" Then there came\nforth a sob, and a tear, and Lizzie's handkerchief was held to her\neyes.\n\n\"Your child! Wouldn't they be kept properly for him, and for the\nfamily, if the jewellers had them? I don't believe you care about\nyour child.\"\n\n\"Aunt Penelope, you had better take care.\"\n\n\"I shall say just what I think, Lizzie. You can't frighten me. The\nfact is, you are disgracing the family you have married into, and as\nyou are my niece--\"\n\n\"I'm not disgracing anybody. You are disgracing everybody.\"\n\n\"As you are my niece, I have undertaken to come to you and to tell\nyou that if you don't give 'em up within a week from this time,\nthey'll proceed against you for--stealing 'em!\" Lady Linlithgow, as\nshe uttered this terrible threat, bobbed her head at her niece in a\nmanner calculated to add very much to the force of her words. The\nwords, and tone, and gesture combined were, in truth, awful.\n\n\"I didn't steal them. My husband gave them to me with his own hands.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't answer Mr. Camperdown's letters, you know. That alone\nwill condemn you. After that there isn't a word to be said about\nit;--not a word. Mr. Camperdown is the family lawyer, and when he\nwrites to you letter after letter you take no more notice of him\nthan a--dog!\" The old woman was certainly very powerful. The way in\nwhich she pronounced that last word did make Lady Eustace ashamed of\nherself. \"Why didn't you answer his letters, unless you knew you were\nin the wrong? Of course you knew you were in the wrong.\"\n\n\"No; I didn't. A woman isn't obliged to answer everything that is\nwritten to her.\"\n\n\"Very well! You just say that before the judge! for you'll have to go\nbefore a judge. I tell you, Lizzie Greystock, or Eustace, or whatever\nyour name is, it's downright picking and stealing. I suppose you want\nto sell them.\"\n\n\"I won't stand this, Aunt Penelope!\" said Lizzie, rising from her\nseat.\n\n\"You must stand it;--and you'll have to stand worse than that. You\ndon't suppose Mr. Camperdown got me to come here for nothing. If you\ndon't want to be made out to be a thief before all the world--\"\n\n\"I won't stand it!\" shrieked Lizzie. \"You have no business to come\nhere and say such things to me. It's my house.\"\n\n\"I shall say just what I please.\"\n\n\"Miss Macnulty, come in.\" And Lizzie threw open the door, hardly\nknowing how the very weak ally whom she now invoked could help her,\nbut driven by the stress of the combat to seek assistance somewhere.\nMiss Macnulty, who was seated near the door, and who had necessarily\nheard every word of the conversation, had no alternative but to\nappear. Of all human beings Lady Linlithgow was to her the most\nterrible, and yet, after a fashion, she loved the old woman. Miss\nMacnulty was humble, cowardly, and subservient; but she was not a\nfool, and she understood the difference between truth and falsehood.\nShe had endured fearful things from Lady Linlithgow; but she knew\nthat there might be more of sound protection in Lady Linlithgow's\nreal wrath than in Lizzie's pretended affection.\n\n\"So you are there, are you?\" said the countess.\n\n\"Yes;--I am here, Lady Linlithgow.\"\n\n\"Listening, I suppose. Well;--so much the better. You know well\nenough, and you can tell her. You ain't a fool, though I suppose\nyou'll be afraid to open your mouth.\"\n\n\"Julia,\" said Lady Eustace, \"will you have the kindness to see that\nmy aunt is shown to her carriage. I cannot stand her violence, and I\nwill go up-stairs.\" So saying she made her way very gracefully into\nthe back drawing-room, whence she could escape to her bed-room.\n\nBut her aunt fired a last shot at her. \"Unless you do as you're bid,\nLizzie, you'll find yourself in prison as sure as eggs!\" Then, when\nher niece was beyond hearing, she turned to Miss Macnulty. \"I suppose\nyou've heard about these diamonds, Macnulty?\"\n\n\"I know she's got them, Lady Linlithgow.\"\n\n\"She has no more right to them than you have. I suppose you're afraid\nto tell her so, lest she should turn you out;--but it's well she\nshould know it. I've done my duty. Never mind about the servant. I'll\nfind my way out of the house.\" Nevertheless the bell was rung, and\nthe countess was shown to her carriage with proper consideration.\n\nThe two ladies went to the opera, and it was not till after their\nreturn, and just as they were going to bed, that anything further was\nsaid about either the necklace or the visit. Miss Macnulty would not\nbegin the subject, and Lizzie purposely postponed it. But not for a\nmoment had it been off Lady Eustace's mind. She did not care much for\nmusic, though she professed to do so,--and thought that she did. But\non this night, had she at other times been a slave to St. Cecilia,\nshe would have been free from that thraldom. The old woman's threats\nhad gone into her very heart's blood. Theft, and prison, and juries,\nand judges had been thrown at her head so violently that she was\nalmost stunned. Could it really be the case that they would prosecute\nher for stealing? She was Lady Eustace, and who but Lady Eustace\nshould have these diamonds or be allowed to wear them? Nobody could\nsay that Sir Florian had not given them to her. It could not, surely,\nbe brought against her as an actual crime that she had not answered\nMr. Camperdown's letters? And yet she was not sure. Her ideas about\nlaw and judicial proceedings were very vague. Of what was wrong and\nwhat was right she had a distinct notion. She knew well enough that\nshe was endeavouring to steal the Eustace diamonds; but she did not\nin the least know what power there might be in the law to prevent, or\nto punish her for the intended theft. She knew well that the thing\nwas not really her own; but there were, as she thought, so many\npoints in her favour, that she felt it to be a cruelty that any one\nshould grudge her the plunder. Was not she the only Lady Eustace\nliving? As to these threats from Mr. Camperdown and Lady Linlithgow,\nshe felt certain they would be used against her whether they were\ntrue or false. She would break her heart should she abandon her\nprey and afterwards find that Mr. Camperdown would have been wholly\npowerless against her had she held on to it. But then who would tell\nher the truth? She was sharp enough to understand, or at any rate\nsuspicious enough to believe, that Mr. Mopus would be actuated by no\nother desire in the matter than that of running up a bill against\nher. \"My dear,\" she said to Miss Macnulty, as they went up-stairs\nafter the opera, \"come into my room a moment. You heard all that my\naunt said?\"\n\n\"I could not help hearing. You told me to stay there, and the door\nwas ajar.\"\n\n\"I wanted you to hear. Of course what she said was the greatest\nnonsense in the world.\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"When she talked about my being taken to prison for not answering\na lawyer's letter, that must be nonsense?\"\n\n\"I suppose that was.\"\n\n\"And then she is such a ferocious old termagant,--such an old\nvulturess. Now isn't she a ferocious old termagant?\" Lizzie paused\nfor an answer, desirous that her companion should join her in her\nenmity against her aunt, but Miss Macnulty was unwilling to say\nanything against one who had been her protectress, and might,\nperhaps, be her protectress again. \"You don't mean to say you don't\nhate her?\" said Lizzie. \"If you didn't hate her after all she has\ndone to you, I should despise you. Don't you hate her?\"\n\n\"I think she's a very upsetting old woman,\" said Miss Macnulty.\n\n\"Oh, you poor creature! Is that all you dare to say about her?\"\n\n\"I'm obliged to be a poor creature,\" said Miss Macnulty, with a red\nspot on each of her cheeks.\n\nLady Eustace understood this, and relented. \"But you needn't be\nafraid,\" she said, \"to tell me what you think.\"\n\n\"About the diamonds, you mean?\"\n\n\"Yes; about the diamonds.\"\n\n\"You have enough without them. I'd give 'em up for peace and quiet.\"\nThat was Miss Macnulty's advice.\n\n\"No;--I haven't enough;--or nearly enough. I've had to buy ever so\nmany things since my husband died. They've done all they could to be\nhard to me. They made me pay for the very furniture at Portray.\" This\nwasn't true; but it was true that Lizzie had endeavoured to palm off\non the Eustace estate bills for new things which she had ordered for\nher own country-house. \"I haven't near enough. I am in debt already.\nPeople talked as though I were the richest woman in the world; but\nwhen it comes to be spent, I ain't rich. Why should I give them up if\nthey're my own?\"\n\n\"Not if they're your own.\"\n\n\"If I give you a present and then die, people can't come and take it\naway afterwards because I didn't put it into my will. There'd be no\nmaking presents like that at all.\" This Lizzie said with an evident\nconviction in the strength of her argument.\n\n\"But this necklace is so very valuable.\"\n\n\"That can't make a difference. If a thing is a man's own he can give\nit away;--not a house, or a farm, or a wood, or anything like that;\nbut a thing that he can carry about with him,--of course he can give\nit away.\"\n\n\"But perhaps Sir Florian didn't mean to give it for always,\"\nsuggested Miss Macnulty.\n\n\"But perhaps he did. He told me that they were mine, and I shall\nkeep them. So that's the end of it. You can go to bed now.\" And Miss\nMacnulty went to bed.\n\nLizzie, as she sat thinking of it, owned to herself that no help was\nto be expected in that quarter. She was not angry with Miss Macnulty,\nwho was, almost of necessity, a poor creature. But she was convinced\nmore strongly than ever that some friend was necessary to her who\nshould not be a poor creature. Lord Fawn, though a peer, was a poor\ncreature. Frank Greystock she believed to be as strong as a house.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nMr. Burke's Speeches\n\n\nLucy Morris had been told by Lady Fawn that,--in point of fact that,\nbeing a governess, she ought to give over falling in love with\nFrank Greystock, and she had not liked it. Lady Fawn no doubt had\nused words less abrupt,--had probably used but few words, and had\nexpressed her meaning chiefly by little winks, and shakings of her\nhead, and small gestures of her hands, and had ended by a kiss,--in\nall of which she had intended to mingle mercy with justice, and had,\nin truth, been full of love. Nevertheless, Lucy had not liked it. No\ngirl likes to be warned against falling in love, whether the warning\nbe needed or not needed. In this case Lucy knew very well that the\ncaution was too late. It might be all very well for Lady Fawn to\ndecide that her governess should not receive visits from a lover in\nher house;--and then the governess might decide whether, in those\ncircumstances, she would remain or go away; but Lady Fawn could have\nno right to tell her governess not to be in love. All this Lucy said\nto herself over and over again, and yet she knew that Lady Fawn had\ntreated her well. The old woman had kissed her, and purred over her,\nand praised her, and had really loved her. As a matter of course,\nLucy was not entitled to have a lover. Lucy knew that well enough. As\nshe walked alone among the shrubs she made arguments in defence of\nLady Fawn as against herself. And yet at every other minute she would\nblaze up into a grand wrath, and picture to herself a scene in which\nshe would tell Lady Fawn boldly that as her lover had been banished\nfrom Fawn Court, she, Lucy, would remain there no longer. There were\nbut two objections to this course. The first was that Frank Greystock\nwas not her lover; and the second, that on leaving Fawn Court\nshe would not know whither to betake herself. It was understood\nby everybody that she was never to leave Fawn Court till an\nunexceptionable home should be found for her, either with the\nHittaways or elsewhere. Lady Fawn would no more allow her to go away,\ndepending for her future on the mere chance of some promiscuous\nengagement, than she would have turned one of her own daughters out\nof the house in the same forlorn condition. Lady Fawn was a tower\nof strength to Lucy. But then a tower of strength may at any moment\nbecome a dungeon.\n\nFrank Greystock was not her lover. Ah,--there was the worst of it\nall! She had given her heart and had got nothing in return. She\nconned it all over in her own mind, striving to ascertain whether\nthere was any real cause for shame to her in her own conduct. Had she\nbeen unmaidenly? Had she been too forward with her heart? Had it been\nextracted from her, as women's hearts are extracted, by efforts on\nthe man's part; or had she simply chucked it away from her to the\nfirst comer? Then she remembered certain scenes at the deanery, words\nthat had been spoken, looks that had been turned upon her, a pressure\nof the hand late at night, a little whisper, a ribbon that had been\nbegged, a flower that had been given;--and once, once--; then there\ncame a burning blush upon her cheek that there should have been so\nmuch, and yet so little that was of avail. She had no right to say\nto any one that the man was her lover. She had no right to assure\nherself that he was her lover. But she knew that some wrong was done\nher in that he was not her lover.\n\nOf the importance of her own self as a living thing with a heart to\nsuffer and a soul to endure, she thought enough. She believed in\nherself, thinking of herself, that should it ever be her lot to be a\nman's wife, she would be to him a true, loving friend and companion,\nliving in his joys, and fighting, if it were necessary, down to the\nstumps of her nails in his interests. But of what she had to give\nover and above her heart and intellect she never thought at all. Of\npersonal beauty she had very little appreciation even in others. The\nform and face of Lady Eustace, which indeed were very lovely, were\ndistasteful to her; whereas she delighted to look upon the broad,\nplain, colourless countenance of Lydia Fawn, who was endeared to\nher by frank good humour and an unselfish disposition. In regard to\nmen she had never asked herself the question whether this man was\nhandsome or that man ugly. Of Frank Greystock she knew that his face\nwas full of quick intellect; and of Lord Fawn she knew that he bore\nno outward index of mind. One man she not only loved, but could not\nhelp loving; the other man, as regarded that sort of sympathy which\nmarriage should recognise, must always have been worlds asunder from\nher. She knew that men demand that women shall possess beauty, and\nshe certainly had never thought of herself as beautiful; but it did\nnot occur to her that on that account she was doomed to fail. She was\ntoo strong-hearted for any such fear. She did not think much of these\nthings, but felt herself to be so far endowed as to be fit to be\nthe wife of such a man as Frank Greystock. She was a proud, stout,\nself-confident, but still modest little woman, too fond of truth to\ntell lies of herself even to herself. She was possessed of a great\npower of sympathy, genial, very social, greatly given to the mirth\nof conversation,--though in talking she would listen much and say\nbut little. She was keenly alive to humour, and had at her command a\ngreat fund of laughter, which would illumine her whole face without\nproducing a sound from her mouth. She knew herself to be too good to\nbe a governess for life;--and yet how could it be otherwise with her?\n\nLady Linlithgow's visit to her niece had been made on a Thursday,\nand on that same evening Frank Greystock had asked his question in\nthe House of Commons,--or rather had made his speech about the Sawab\nof Mygawb. We all know the meaning of such speeches. Had not Frank\nbelonged to the party that was out, and had not the resistance to\nthe Sawab's claim come from the party that was in, Frank would not\nprobably have cared much about the prince. We may be sure that he\nwould not have troubled himself to read a line of that very dull\nand long pamphlet of which he had to make himself master before he\ncould venture to stir in the matter, had not the road of Opposition\nbeen open to him in that direction. But what exertion will not a\npolitician make with the view of getting the point of his lance\nwithin the joints of his enemies' harness? Frank made his speech, and\nmade it very well. It was just the case for a lawyer, admitting that\nkind of advocacy which it is a lawyer's business to practise. The\nIndian minister of the day, Lord Fawn's chief, had determined, after\nmuch anxious consideration, that it was his duty to resist the claim;\nand then, for resisting it, he was attacked. Had he yielded to the\nclaim, the attack would have been as venomous, and very probably\nwould have come from the same quarter. No blame by such an assertion\nis cast upon the young Conservative aspirant for party honours. It is\nthus the war is waged. Frank Greystock took up the Sawab's case, and\nwould have drawn mingled tears and indignation from his hearers, had\nnot his hearers all known the conditions of the contest. On neither\nside did the hearers care much for the Sawab's claims, but they felt\nthat Greystock was making good his own claims to some future reward\nfrom his party. He was very hard upon the minister,--and he was\nhard also upon Lord Fawn, stating that the cruelty of Government\nascendancy had never been put forward as a doctrine in plainer terms\nthan those which had been used in \"another place\" in reference to the\nwrongs of this poor ill-used native chieftain. This was very grievous\nto Lord Fawn, who had personally desired to favour the ill-used\nchieftain;--and harder again because he and Greystock were intimate\nwith each other. He felt the thing keenly, and was full of his\ngrievance when, in accordance with his custom, he came down to Fawn\nCourt on the Saturday evening.\n\nThe Fawn family, which consisted entirely of women, dined early. On\nSaturdays, when his lordship would come down, a dinner was prepared\nfor him alone. On Sundays they all dined together at three o'clock.\nOn Sunday evening Lord Fawn would return to town to prepare himself\nfor his Monday's work. Perhaps, also, he disliked the sermon which\nLady Fawn always read to the assembled household at nine o'clock on\nSunday evening. On this Saturday he came out into the grounds after\ndinner, where the oldest unmarried daughter, the present Miss Fawn,\nwas walking with Lucy Morris. It was almost a summer evening;--so\nmuch so, that some of the party had been sitting on the garden\nbenches, and four of the girls were still playing croquet on the\nlawn, though there was hardly light enough to see the balls. Miss\nFawn had already told Lucy that her brother was very angry with\nMr. Greystock. Now, Lucy's sympathies were all with Frank and the\nSawab. She had endeavoured, indeed, and had partially succeeded, in\nperverting the Under-Secretary. Nor did she now intend to change her\nopinions, although all the Fawn girls, and Lady Fawn, were against\nher. When a brother or a son is an Under-Secretary of State, sisters\nand mothers will constantly be on the side of the Government, so far\nas that Under-Secretary's office is concerned.\n\n\"Upon my word, Frederic,\" said Augusta Fawn, \"I do think Mr.\nGreystock was too bad.\"\n\n\"There's nothing these fellows won't say or do,\" exclaimed Lord Fawn.\n\"I can't understand it myself. When I've been in opposition, I never\ndid that kind of thing.\"\n\n\"I wonder whether it was because he is angry with mamma,\" said Miss\nFawn. Everybody who knew the Fawns knew that Augusta Fawn was not\nclever, and that she would occasionally say the very thing that ought\nnot to be said.\n\n\"Oh, dear, no,\" said the Under-Secretary, who could not endure the\nidea that the weak women-kind of his family should have, in any way,\nan influence on the august doings of Parliament.\n\n\"You know mamma did--\"\n\n\"Nothing of that kind at all,\" said his lordship, putting down his\nsister with great authority. \"Mr. Greystock is simply not an honest\npolitician. That is about the whole of it. He chose to attack me\nbecause there was an opportunity. There isn't a man in either House\nwho cares for such things, personally, less than I do;\"--had his\nlordship said \"more than he did,\" he might, perhaps, have been\ncorrect;--\"but I can't bear the feeling. The fact is, a lawyer never\nunderstands what is and what is not fair fighting.\"\n\nLucy felt her face tingling with heat, and was preparing to say\na word in defence of that special lawyer, when Lady Fawn's voice\nwas heard from the drawing-room window. \"Come in, girls. It's nine\no'clock.\" In that house Lady Fawn reigned supreme, and no one ever\ndoubted, for a moment, as to obedience. The clicking of the balls\nceased, and those who were walking immediately turned their faces to\nthe drawing-room window. But Lord Fawn, who was not one of the girls,\ntook another turn by himself, thinking of the wrongs he had endured.\n\n\"Frederic is so angry about Mr. Greystock,\" said Augusta, as soon as\nthey were seated.\n\n\"I do feel that it was provoking,\" said the second sister.\n\n\"And considering that Mr. Greystock has so often been here, I don't\nthink it was kind,\" said the third.\n\nLydia did not speak, but could not refrain from glancing her eyes at\nLucy's face. \"I believe everything is considered fair in Parliament,\"\nsaid Lady Fawn.\n\nThen Lord Fawn, who had heard the last words, entered through the\nwindow. \"I don't know about that, mother,\" said he. \"Gentleman-like\nconduct is the same everywhere. There are things that may be said\nand there are things which may not. Mr. Greystock has altogether\ngone beyond the usual limits, and I shall take care that he knows my\nopinion.\"\n\n\"You are not going to quarrel with the man?\" asked the mother.\n\n\"I am not going to fight him, if you mean that; but I shall let him\nknow that I think that he has transgressed.\" This his lordship said\nwith that haughty superiority which a man may generally display with\nsafety among the women of his own family.\n\nLucy had borne a great deal, knowing well that it was better that she\nshould bear such injury in silence;--but there was a point beyond\nwhich she could not endure it. It was intolerable to her that Mr.\nGreystock's character as a gentleman should be impugned before all\nthe ladies of the family, every one of whom did, in fact, know her\nliking for the man. And then it seemed to her that she could rush\ninto the battle, giving a side blow at his lordship on behalf of his\nabsent antagonist, but appearing to fight for the Sawab. There had\nbeen a time when the poor Sawab was in favour at Fawn Court. \"I think\nMr. Greystock was right to say all he could for the prince. If he\ntook up the cause, he was bound to make the best of it.\" She spoke\nwith energy and with a heightened colour; and Lady Fawn, hearing her,\nshook her head at her.\n\n\"Did you read Mr. Greystock's speech, Miss Morris?\" asked Lord Fawn.\n\n\"Every word of it, in the _Times_.\"\n\n\"And you understood his allusion to what I had been called upon to\nsay in the House of Lords on behalf of the Government?\"\n\n\"I suppose I did. It did not seem to be difficult to understand.\"\n\n\"I do think Mr. Greystock should have abstained from attacking\nFrederic,\" said Augusta.\n\n\"It was not--not quite the thing that we are accustomed to,\" said\nLord Fawn.\n\n\"Of course I don't know about that,\" said Lucy. \"I think the prince\nis being used very ill,--that he is being deprived of his own\nproperty,--that he is kept out of his rights, just because he is\nweak, and I am very glad that there is some one to speak up for him.\"\n\n\"My dear Lucy,\" said Lady Fawn, \"if you discuss politics with Lord\nFawn, you'll get the worst of it.\"\n\n\"I don't at all object to Miss Morris's views about the Sawab,\" said\nthe Under-Secretary generously. \"There is a great deal to be said on\nboth sides. I know of old that Miss Morris is a great friend of the\nSawab.\"\n\n\"You used to be his friend too,\" said Lucy.\n\n\"I felt for him,--and do feel for him. All that is very well. I ask\nno one to agree with me on the question itself. I only say that Mr.\nGreystock's mode of treating it was unbecoming.\"\n\n\"I think it was the very best speech I ever read in my life,\" said\nLucy, with headlong energy and heightened colour.\n\n\"Then, Miss Morris, you and I have very different opinions about\nspeeches,\" said Lord Fawn, with severity. \"You have, probably, never\nread Burke's speeches.\"\n\n\"And I don't want to read them,\" said Lucy.\n\n\"That is another question,\" said Lord Fawn; and his tone and manner\nwere very severe indeed.\n\n\"We are talking about speeches in Parliament,\" said Lucy. Poor Lucy!\nShe knew quite as well as did Lord Fawn that Burke had been a House\nof Commons orator; but in her impatience, and from absence of the\nhabit of argument, she omitted to explain that she was talking about\nthe speeches of the day.\n\nLord Fawn held up his hands, and put his head a little on one side.\n\"My dear Lucy,\" said Lady Fawn, \"you are showing your ignorance.\nWhere do you suppose that Mr. Burke's speeches were made?\"\n\n\"Of course I know they were made in Parliament,\" said Lucy, almost in\ntears.\n\n\"If Miss Morris means that Burke's greatest efforts were not made\nin Parliament,--that his speech to the electors of Bristol, for\ninstance, and his opening address on the trial of Warren Hastings,\nwere, upon the whole, superior to--\"\n\n\"I didn't mean anything at all,\" said Lucy.\n\n\"Lord Fawn is trying to help you, my dear,\" said Lady Fawn.\n\n\"I don't want to be helped,\" said Lucy. \"I only mean that I thought\nMr. Greystock's speech as good as it could possibly be. There wasn't\na word in it that didn't seem to me to be just what it ought to be. I\ndo think that they are ill-treating that poor Indian prince, and I am\nvery glad that somebody has had the courage to get up and say so.\"\n\nNo doubt it would have been better that Lucy should have held her\ntongue. Had she simply been upholding against an opponent a political\nspeaker whose speech she had read with pleasure, she might have held\nher own in the argument against the whole Fawn family. She was a\nfavourite with them all, and even the Under-Secretary would not have\nbeen hard upon her. But there had been more than this for poor Lucy\nto do. Her heart was so truly concerned in the matter, that she could\nnot refrain herself from resenting an attack on the man she loved.\nShe had allowed herself to be carried into superlatives, and had\nalmost been uncourteous to Lord Fawn. \"My dear,\" said Lady Fawn,\n\"we won't say anything more upon the subject.\" Lord Fawn took up a\nbook. Lady Fawn busied herself in her knitting. Lydia assumed a look\nof unhappiness, as though something very sad had occurred. Augusta\naddressed a question to her brother in a tone which plainly indicated\na feeling on her part that her brother had been ill-used and was\nentitled to special consideration. Lucy sat silent and still, and\nthen left the room with a hurried step. Lydia at once rose to follow\nher, but was stopped by her mother. \"You had better leave her alone\njust at present, my dear,\" said Lady Fawn.\n\n\"I did not know that Miss Morris was so particularly interested in\nMr. Greystock,\" said Lord Fawn.\n\n\"She has known him since she was a child,\" said his mother.\n\nAbout an hour afterwards Lady Fawn went up-stairs and found Lucy\nsitting all alone in the still so-called school-room. She had no\ncandle, and had made no pretence to do anything since she had left\nthe room down-stairs. In the interval family prayers had been read,\nand Lucy's absence was unusual and contrary to rule. \"Lucy, my dear,\nwhy are you sitting here?\" said Lady Fawn.\n\n\"Because I am unhappy.\"\n\n\"What makes you unhappy, Lucy?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I would rather you didn't ask me. I suppose I behaved\nbadly down-stairs.\"\n\n\"My son would forgive you in a moment if you asked him.\"\n\n\"No;--certainly not. I can beg your pardon, Lady Fawn, but not his.\nOf course I had no right to talk about speeches, and politics, and\nthis prince in your drawing-room.\"\n\n\"Lucy, you astonish me.\"\n\n\"But it is so. Dear Lady Fawn, don't look like that. I know how good\nyou are to me. I know you let me do things which other governesses\nmayn't do;--and say things; but still I am a governess, and I know I\nmisbehaved--to you.\" Then Lucy burst into tears.\n\nLady Fawn, in whose bosom there was no stony corner or morsel of hard\niron, was softened at once. \"My dear, you are more like another\ndaughter to me than anything else.\"\n\n\"Dear Lady Fawn!\"\n\n\"But it makes me unhappy when I see your mind engaged about Mr.\nGreystock. There is the truth, Lucy. You should not think of Mr.\nGreystock. Mr. Greystock is a man who has his way to make in the\nworld, and could not marry you, even if, under other circumstances,\nhe would wish to do so. You know how frank I am with you, giving you\ncredit for honest, sound good sense. To me and to my girls, who know\nyou as a lady, you are as dear a friend as though you were--were\nanything you may please to think. Lucy Morris is to us our own dear,\ndear little friend Lucy. But Mr. Greystock, who is a Member of\nParliament, could not marry a governess.\"\n\n\"But I love him so dearly,\" said Lucy, getting up from her chair,\n\"that his slightest word is to me more than all the words of all the\nworld beside! It is no use, Lady Fawn. I do love him, and I don't\nmean to try to give it up!\" Lady Fawn stood silent for a moment, and\nthen suggested that it would be better for them both to go to bed.\nDuring that minute she had been unable to decide what she had better\nsay or do in the present emergency.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nThe Conquering Hero Comes\n\n\nThe reader will perhaps remember that when Lizzie Eustace was told\nthat her aunt was down-stairs Frank Greystock was with her, and that\nhe promised to return on the following day to hear the result of the\ninterview. Had Lady Linlithgow not come at that very moment Frank\nwould probably have asked his rich cousin to be his wife. She had\ntold him that she was solitary and unhappy; and after that what else\ncould he have done but ask her to be his wife? The old countess,\nhowever, arrived, and interrupted him. He went away abruptly,\npromising to come on the morrow;--but on the morrow he never came. It\nwas a Friday, and Lizzie remained at home for him the whole morning.\nWhen four o'clock was passed she knew that he would be at the House.\nBut still she did not stir. And she contrived that Miss Macnulty\nshould be absent the entire day. Miss Macnulty was even made to go\nto the play by herself in the evening. But her absence was of no\nservice. Frank Greystock came not; and at eleven at night Lizzie\nswore to herself that should he ever come again, he should come in\nvain. Nevertheless, through the whole of Saturday she expected him\nwith more or less of confidence, and on the Sunday morning she was\nstill well-inclined towards him. It might be that he would come on\nthat day. She could understand that a man with his hands so full of\nbusiness, as were those of her cousin Frank, should find himself\nunable to keep an appointment. Nor would there be fair ground\nfor permanent anger with such a one, even should he forget an\nappointment. But surely he would come on the Sunday! She had been\nquite sure that the offer was about to be made when that odious old\nharridan had come in and disturbed everything. Indeed, the offer had\nbeen all but made. She had felt the premonitory flutter, had asked\nherself the important question,--and had answered it. She had told\nherself that the thing would do. Frank was not the exact hero that\nher fancy had painted,--but he was sufficiently heroic. Everybody\nsaid that he would work his way up to the top of the tree, and become\na rich man. At any rate she had resolved;--and then Lady Linlithgow\nhad come in! Surely he would come on the Sunday.\n\nHe did not come on the Sunday, but Lord Fawn did come. Immediately\nafter morning church Lord Fawn declared his intention of returning at\nonce from Fawn Court to town. He was very silent at breakfast, and\nhis sisters surmised that he was still angry with poor Lucy. Lucy,\ntoo, was unlike herself,--was silent, sad, and oppressed. Lady Fawn\nwas serious, and almost solemn;--so that there was little even of\nholy mirth at Fawn Court on that Sunday morning. The whole family,\nhowever, went to church, and immediately on their return Lord Fawn\nexpressed his intention of returning to town. All the sisters felt\nthat an injury had been done to them by Lucy. It was only on Sundays\nthat their dinner-table was graced by the male member of the family,\nand now he was driven away. \"I am sorry that you are going to desert\nus, Frederic,\" said Lady Fawn. Lord Fawn muttered something as to\nabsolute necessity, and went. The afternoon was very dreary at Fawn\nCourt. Nothing was said on the subject; but there was still the\nfeeling that Lucy had offended. At four o'clock on that Sunday\nafternoon Lord Fawn was closeted with Lady Eustace.\n\nThe \"closeting\" consisted simply in the fact that Miss Macnulty was\nnot present. Lizzie fully appreciated the pleasure, and utility, and\ngeneral convenience of having a companion, but she had no scruple\nwhatever in obtaining absolute freedom for herself when she desired\nit. \"My dear,\" she would say, \"the best friends in the world\nshouldn't always be together; should they? Wouldn't you like to\ngo to the Horticultural?\" Then Miss Macnulty would go to the\nHorticultural,--or else up into her own bed-room. When Lizzie was\nbeginning to wax wrathful again because Frank Greystock did not come,\nLord Fawn made his appearance. \"How kind this is,\" said Lizzie. \"I\nthought you were always at Richmond on Sundays.\"\n\n\"I have just come up from my mother's,\" said Lord Fawn, twiddling his\nhat. Then Lizzie, with a pretty eagerness, asked after Lady Fawn and\nthe girls, and her dear little friend Lucy Morris. Lizzie could be\nvery prettily eager when she pleased. She leaned forward her face\nas she asked her questions, and threw back her loose lustrous lock\nof hair, with her long lithe fingers covered with diamonds,--the\ndiamonds, these, which Sir Florian had really given her, or which she\nhad procured from Mr. Benjamin in the clever manner described in the\nopening chapter. \"They are, all quite well, thank you,\" said Lord\nFawn. \"I believe Miss Morris is quite well, though she was a little\nout of sorts last night.\"\n\n\"She is not ill, I hope,\" said Lizzie, bringing the lustrous lock\nforward again.\n\n\"In her temper, I mean,\" said Lord Fawn.\n\n\"Indeed! I hope Miss Lucy is not forgetting herself. That would be\nvery sad, after the great kindness she has received.\" Lord Fawn said\nthat it would be very sad, and then put his hat down upon the floor.\nIt came upon Lizzie at that moment, as by a flash of lightning,--by\nan electric message delivered to her intellect by that movement of\nthe hat,--that she might be sure of Lord Fawn if she chose to take\nhim. On Friday she might have been sure of Frank,--only that Lady\nLinlithgow came in the way. But now she did not feel at all sure of\nFrank. Lord Fawn was at any rate a peer. She had heard that he was a\npoor peer,--but a peer, she thought, can't be altogether poor. And\nthough he was a stupid owl,--she did not hesitate to acknowledge to\nherself that he was as stupid as an owl,--he had a position. He was\none of the Government, and his wife would, no doubt, be able to go\nanywhere. It was becoming essential to her that she should marry.\nEven though her husband should give up the diamonds, she would not\nin such case incur the disgrace of surrendering them herself. She\nwould have kept them till she had ceased to be a Eustace. Frank had\ncertainly meant it on that Thursday afternoon;--but surely he would\nhave been in Mount Street before this if he had not changed his mind.\nWe all know that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. \"I have\nbeen at Fawn Court once or twice,\" said Lizzie, with her sweetest\ngrace, \"and I always think it a model of real family happiness.\"\n\n\"I hope you may be there very often,\" said Lord Fawn.\n\n\"Ah, I have no right to intrude myself often on your mother, Lord\nFawn.\"\n\nThere could hardly be a better opening than this for him had he\nchosen to accept it. But it was not thus that he had arranged\nit,--for he had made his arrangements. \"There would be no feeling of\nthat kind, I am sure,\" he said. And then he was silent. How was he to\ndeploy himself on the ground before him so as to make the strategy\nwhich he had prepared answer the occasion of the day? \"Lady Eustace,\"\nhe said, \"I don't know what your views of life may be.\"\n\n\"I have a child, you know, to bring up.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes;--that gives a great interest, of course.\"\n\n\"He will inherit a very large fortune, Lord Fawn;--too large, I fear,\nto be of service to a youth of one-and-twenty; and I must endeavour\nto fit him for the possession of it. That is,--and always must be,\nthe chief object of my existence.\" Then she felt that she had said\ntoo much. He was just the man who would be fool enough to believe\nher. \"Not but what it is hard to do it. A mother can of course devote\nherself to her child;--but when a portion of the devotion must be\ngiven to the preservation of material interests there is less of\ntenderness in it. Don't you think so?\"\n\n\"No doubt,\" said Lord Fawn;--\"no doubt.\" But he had not followed\nher, and was still thinking of his own strategy. \"It's a comfort, of\ncourse, to know that one's child is provided for.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes;--but they tell me the poor little dear will have forty\nthousand a year when he's of age; and when I look at him in his\nlittle bed, and press him in my arms, and think of all that money, I\nalmost wish that his father had been a poor plain gentleman.\" Then\nthe handkerchief was put to her eyes, and Lord Fawn had a moment in\nwhich to collect himself.\n\n\"Ah!--I myself am a poor man;--for my rank I mean.\"\n\n\"A man with your position, Lord Fawn, and your talents and genius for\nbusiness, can never be poor.\"\n\n\"My father's property was all Irish, you know.\"\n\n\"Was it indeed?\"\n\n\"And he was an Irish peer, till Lord Melbourne gave him an English\npeerage.\"\n\n\"An Irish peer, was he?\" Lizzie understood nothing of this, but\npresumed that an Irish peer was a peer who had not sufficient money\nto live upon. Lord Fawn, however, was endeavouring to describe his\nown history in as few words as possible.\n\n\"He was then made Lord Fawn of Richmond, in the peerage of the United\nKingdom. Fawn Court, you know, belonged to my mother's father before\nmy mother's marriage. The property in Ireland is still mine, but\nthere's no place on it.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\"\n\n\"There was a house, but my father allowed it to tumble down. It's in\nTipperary;--not at all a desirable country to live in.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear, no! Don't they murder the people?\"\n\n\"It's about five thousand a year, and out of that my mother has half\nfor her life.\"\n\n\"What an excellent family arrangement,\" said Lizzie. There was so\nlong a pause made between each statement that she was forced to make\nsome reply.\n\n\"You see, for a peer, the fortune is very small indeed.\"\n\n\"But then you have a salary;--don't you?\"\n\n\"At present I have;--but no one can tell how long that may last.\"\n\n\"I'm sure it's for everybody's good that it should go on for ever so\nmany years,\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Lord Fawn. \"I'm afraid, however, there are a great\nmany people who don't think so. Your cousin Greystock would do\nanything on earth to turn us out.\"\n\n\"Luckily, my cousin Frank has not much power,\" said Lizzie. And\nin saying it she threw into her tone, and into her countenance, a\ncertain amount of contempt for Frank as a man and as a politician,\nwhich was pleasant to Lord Fawn.\n\n\"Now,\" said he, \"I have told you everything about myself which I was\nbound, as a man of honour, to tell before--I--I--I--. In short you\nknow what I mean.\"\n\n\"Oh, Lord Fawn!\"\n\n\"I have told you everything. I owe no money, but I could not afford\nto marry a wife without an income. I admire you more than any woman I\never saw. I love you with all my heart.\" He was now standing upright\nbefore her, with the fingers of his right hand touching his left\nbreast, and there was something almost of dignity in his gesture and\ndemeanour. \"It may be that you are determined never to marry again.\nI can only say that if you will trust yourself to me,--yourself and\nyour child,--I will do my duty truly by you both, and will make your\nhappiness the chief object of my existence.\" When she had listened to\nhim thus far, of course she must accept him; but he was by no means\naware of that. She sat silent, with her hands folded on her breast,\nlooking down upon the ground; but he did not as yet attempt to seat\nhimself by her. \"Lady Eustace,\" he continued, \"may I venture to\nentertain a hope?\"\n\n\"May I not have an hour to think of it?\" said Lizzie, just venturing\nto turn a glance of her eye upon his face.\n\n\"Oh, certainly. I will call again whenever you may bid me.\"\n\nNow she was silent for two or three minutes, during which he still\nstood over her. But he had dropped his hand from his breast, and had\nstooped, and picked up his hat ready for his departure. Was he to\ncome again on Monday, or Tuesday, or Wednesday? Let her tell him that\nand he would go. He doubtless reflected that Wednesday would suit him\nbest, because there would be no House. But Lizzie was too magnanimous\nfor this. \"Lord Fawn,\" she said, rising, \"you have paid me the\ngreatest compliment that a man can pay a woman. Coming from you it is\ndoubly precious; first, because of your character; and secondly--\"\n\n\"Why secondly?\"\n\n\"Secondly, because I can love you.\" This was said in her lowest\nwhisper, and then she moved towards him gently, and almost laid her\nhead upon his breast. Of course he put his arm round her waist,--but\nit was first necessary that he should once more disembarrass himself\nof his hat,--and then her head was upon his breast. \"Dearest Lizzie!\"\nhe said.\n\n\"Dearest Frederic!\" she murmured.\n\n\"I shall write to my mother to-night,\" he said.\n\n\"Do, do;--dear Frederic.\"\n\n\"And she will come to you at once, I am sure.\"\n\n\"I will receive her and love her as a mother,\" said Lizzie, with\nall her energy. Then he kissed her again,--her forehead and her\nlips,--and took his leave, promising to be with her at any rate on\nWednesday.\n\n\"Lady Fawn!\" she said to herself. The name did not sound so well as\nthat of Lady Eustace. But it is much to be a wife; and more to be a\npeeress.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nShowing What the Miss Fawns Said, and What Mrs. Hittaway Thought\n\n\nIn the way of duty Lord Fawn was a Hercules,--not, indeed, \"climbing\ntrees in the Hesperides,\" but achieving enterprises which, to other\nmen, if not impossible, would have been so unpalatable as to have\nbeen put aside as impracticable. On the Monday morning, after he was\naccepted by Lady Eustace, he was with his mother at Fawn Court before\nhe went down to the India Office.\n\nHe had at least been very honest in the description he had given of\nhis own circumstances to the lady whom he intended to marry. He had\ntold her the exact truth; and though she, with all her cleverness,\nhad not been able to realise the facts when related to her so\nsuddenly, still enough had been said to make it quite clear that,\nwhen details of business should hereafter be discussed in a less\nhurried manner, he would be able to say that he had explained all his\ncircumstances before he had made his offer. And he had been careful,\ntoo, as to her affairs. He had ascertained that her late husband had\ncertainly settled upon her for life an estate worth four thousand a\nyear. He knew, also, that eight thousand pounds had been left her,\nbut of that he took no account. It might be probable that she had\nspent it. If any of it were left, it would be a godsend. Lord Fawn\nthought a great deal about money. Being a poor man, filling a place\nfit only for rich men, he had been driven to think of money, and had\nbecome self-denying and parsimonious,--perhaps we may say hungry\nand close-fisted. Such a condition of character is the natural\nconsequence of such a position. There is, probably, no man who\nbecomes naturally so hard in regard to money as he who is bound to\nlive among rich men, who is not rich himself, and who is yet honest.\nThe weight of the work of life in these circumstances is so crushing,\nrequires such continued thought, and makes itself so continually\nfelt, that the mind of the sufferer is never free from the\ncontamination of sixpences. Of such a one it is not fair to judge\nas of other men with similar incomes. Lord Fawn had declared to his\nfuture bride that he had half five thousand a year to spend,--or the\nhalf, rather, of such actual income as might be got in from an estate\npresumed to give five thousand a year,--and it may be said that an\nunmarried gentleman ought not to be poor with such an income. But\nLord Fawn unfortunately was a lord, unfortunately was a landlord,\nunfortunately was an Irish landlord. Let him be as careful as he\nmight with his sixpences, his pounds would fly from him, or, as\nmight, perhaps, be better said, could not be made to fly to him. He\nwas very careful with his sixpences, and was always thinking, not\nexactly how he might make two ends meet, but how to reconcile the\nstrictest personal economy with the proper bearing of an English\nnobleman.\n\nSuch a man almost naturally looks to marriage as an assistance in\nthe dreary fight. It soon becomes clear to him that he cannot marry\nwithout money, and he learns to think that heiresses have been\ninvented exactly to suit his case. He is conscious of having been\nsubjected to hardship by Fortune, and regards female wealth as his\nlegitimate mode of escape from it. He has got himself, his position,\nand, perhaps, his title to dispose of, and they are surely worth\nso much per annum. As for giving anything away, that is out of the\nquestion. He has not been so placed as to be able to give. But, being\nan honest man, he will, if possible, make a fair bargain. Lord Fawn\nwas certainly an honest man, and he had been endeavouring for the\nlast six or seven years to make a fair bargain. But then it is so\nhard to decide what is fair. Who is to tell a Lord Fawn how much per\nannum he ought to regard himself as worth? He had, on one or two\noccasions, asked a high price, but no previous bargain had been made.\nNo doubt he had come down a little in his demand in suggesting a\nmatrimonial arrangement to a widow with a child, and with only four\nthousand a year. Whether or no that income was hers in perpetuity, or\nonly for life, he had not positively known when he made his offer.\nThe will made by Sir Florian Eustace did not refer to the property\nat all. In the natural course of things, the widow would only have\na life-interest in the income. Why should Sir Florian make away, in\nperpetuity, with his family property? Nevertheless, there had been\na rumour abroad that Sir Florian had been very generous; that the\nScotch estate was to go to a second son in the event of there being\na second son;--but that otherwise it was to be at the widow's own\ndisposal. No doubt, had Lord Fawn been persistent, he might have\nfound out the exact truth. He had, however, calculated that he could\nafford to accept even the life-income. If more should come of it, so\nmuch the better for him. He might, at any rate, so arrange the family\nmatters, that his heir, should he have one, should not at his death\nbe called upon to pay something more than half the proceeds of the\nfamily property to his mother,--as was now done by himself.\n\nLord Fawn breakfasted at Fawn Court on the Monday, and his mother sat\nat the table with him, pouring out his tea. \"Oh, Frederic,\" she said,\n\"it is so important!\"\n\n\"Just so;--very important indeed. I should like you to call and see\nher either to-day or to-morrow.\"\n\n\"That's of course.\"\n\n\"And you had better get her down here.\"\n\n\"I don't know that she'll come. Ought I to ask the little boy?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Lord Fawn, as he put a spoonful of egg into his\nmouth; \"certainly.\"\n\n\"And Miss Macnulty?\"\n\n\"No; I don't see that at all. I'm not going to marry Miss Macnulty.\nThe child, of course, must be one of us.\"\n\n\"And what is the income, Frederic?\"\n\n\"Four thousand a year. Something more, nominally, but four thousand\nto spend.\"\n\n\"You are sure about that?\"\n\n\"Quite sure.\"\n\n\"And for ever?\"\n\n\"I believe so. Of that I am not sure.\"\n\n\"It makes a great difference, Frederic.\"\n\n\"A very great difference indeed. I think it is her own. But, at any\nrate, she is much younger than I am, and there need be no settlement\nout of my property. That is the great thing. Don't you think\nshe's--nice?\"\n\n\"She is very lovely.\"\n\n\"And clever?\"\n\n\"Certainly very clever. I hope she is not self-willed, Frederic.\"\n\n\"If she is, we must try and balance it,\" said Lord Fawn, with a\nlittle smile. But, in truth, he had thought nothing about any such\nquality as that to which his mother now referred. The lady had an\nincome. That was the first and most indispensable consideration. She\nwas fairly well-born, was a lady, and was beautiful. In doing Lord\nFawn justice, we must allow that, in all his attempted matrimonial\nspeculations, some amount of feminine loveliness had been combined\nwith feminine wealth. He had for two years been a suitor of Violet\nEffingham, who was the acknowledged beauty of the day,--of Violet\nEffingham who, at the present time, was the wife of Lord Chiltern;\nand he had offered himself thrice to Madame Max Goesler, who was\nreputed to be as rich as she was beautiful. In either case, the\nfortune would have been greater than that which he would now win, and\nthe money would certainly have been for ever. But in these attempts\nhe had failed; and Lord Fawn was not a man to think himself ill-used\nbecause he did not get the first good thing for which he asked.\n\n\"I suppose I may tell the girls?\" said Lady Fawn.\n\n\"Yes;--when I am gone. I must be off now, only I could not bear not\nto come and see you.\"\n\n\"It was so like you, Frederic.\"\n\n\"And you'll go to-day?\"\n\n\"Yes; if you wish it,--certainly.\"\n\n\"Go up in the carriage, you know, and take one of the girls with you.\nI would not take more than one. Augusta will be the best. You'll see\nClara, I suppose.\" Clara was the married sister, Mrs. Hittaway.\n\n\"If you wish it.\"\n\n\"She had better call too,--say on Thursday. It's quite as well that\nit should be known. I sha'n't choose to have more delay than can be\navoided. Well;--I believe that's all.\"\n\n\"I hope she'll be a good wife to you, Frederic.\"\n\n\"I don't see why she shouldn't. Good-bye, mother. Tell the girls I\nwill see them next Saturday.\" He didn't see why this woman he was\nabout to marry should not be a good wife to him! And yet he knew\nnothing about her, and had not taken the slightest trouble to make\ninquiry. That she was pretty he could see; that she was clever he\ncould understand; that she lived in Mount Street was a fact; her\nparentage was known to him;--that she was the undoubted mistress\nof a large income was beyond dispute. But, for aught he knew, she\nmight be afflicted by every vice to which a woman can be subject. In\ntruth, she was afflicted by so many, that the addition of all the\nothers could hardly have made her worse than she was. She had never\nsacrificed her beauty to a lover,--she had never sacrificed anything\nto anybody,--nor did she drink. It would be difficult, perhaps, to\nsay anything else in her favour; and yet Lord Fawn was quite content\nto marry her, not having seen any reason why she should not make a\ngood wife! Nor had Sir Florian seen any reason;--but she had broken\nSir Florian's heart.\n\nWhen the girls heard the news, they were half frightened and half\ndelighted. Lady Fawn and her daughters lived very much out of the\nworld. They also were poor rich people,--if such a term may be\nused,--and did not go much into society. There was a butler kept at\nFawn Court, and a boy in buttons, and two gardeners, and a man to\nlook after the cows, and a carriage and horses, and a fat coachman.\nThere was a cook and a scullery maid, and two lady's maids,--who had\nto make the dresses,--and two housemaids and a dairymaid. There was a\nlarge old brick house to be kept in order, and handsome grounds with\nold trees. There was, as we know, a governess, and there were seven\nunmarried daughters. With such encumbrances, and an income altogether\nnot exceeding three thousand pounds per annum, Lady Fawn could not be\nrich. And yet who would say that an old lady and her daughters could\nbe poor with three thousand pounds a year to spend? It may be taken\nalmost as a rule by the unennobled ones of this country, that the\nsudden possession of a title would at once raise the price of every\narticle consumed twenty per cent. Mutton that before cost ninepence\nwould cost tenpence a pound, and the mouths to be fed would demand\nmore meat. The chest of tea would run out quicker. The labourer's\nwork, which for the farmer is ten hours a day, for the squire nine,\nis for the peer only eight. Miss Jones, when she becomes Lady de\nJongh, does not pay less than threepence apiece for each \"my lady\"\nwith which her ear is tickled. Even the baronet when he becomes a\nlord has to curtail his purchases, because of increased price, unless\nhe be very wide awake to the affairs of the world. Old Lady Fawn, who\nwould not on any account have owed a shilling which she could not\npay, and who, in the midst of her economies, was not close-fisted,\nknew very well what she could do and what she could not. The old\nfamily carriage and the two lady's maids were there,--as necessaries\nof life; but London society was not within her reach. It was,\ntherefore, the case that they had not heard very much about Lizzie\nEustace. But they had heard something. \"I hope she won't be too fond\nof going out,\" said Amelia, the second girl.\n\n\"Or extravagant,\" said Georgina, the third.\n\n\"There was some story of her being terribly in debt when she married\nSir Florian Eustace,\" said Diana, the fourth.\n\n\"Frederic will be sure to see to that,\" said Augusta, the eldest.\n\n\"She is very beautiful,\" said Lydia, the fifth.\n\n\"And clever,\" said Cecilia, the sixth.\n\n\"Beauty and cleverness won't make a good wife,\" said Amelia, who was\nthe wise one of the family.\n\n\"Frederic will be sure to see that she doesn't go wrong,\" said\nAugusta, who was not wise.\n\nThen Lucy Morris entered the room with Nina, the cadette of the\nfamily. \"Oh, Nina, what do you think?\" said Lydia.\n\n\"My dear!\" said Lady Fawn, putting up her hand and stopping further\nindiscreet speech.\n\n\"Oh, mamma, what is it?\" asked the cadette.\n\n\"Surely Lucy may be told,\" said Lydia.\n\n\"Well, yes; Lucy may be told certainly. There can be no reason why\nLucy should not know all that concerns our family;--and the more so\nas she has been for many years intimate with the lady. My dear, my\nson is going to be married to Lady Eustace.\"\n\n\"Lord Fawn going to marry Lizzie!\" said Lucy Morris, in a tone which\ncertainly did not express unmingled satisfaction.\n\n\"Unless you forbid the banns,\" said Diana.\n\n\"Is there any reason why he should not?\" said Lady Fawn.\n\n\"Oh, no;--only it seems so odd. I didn't know that they knew each\nother;--not well, that is. And then--\"\n\n\"Then what, my dear?\"\n\n\"It seems odd;--that's all. It's all very nice, I dare say, and I'm\nsure I hope they will be happy.\" Lady Fawn, however, was displeased,\nand did not speak to Lucy again before she started with Augusta on\nthe journey to London.\n\nThe carriage first stopped at the door of the married daughter in\nWarwick Square. Now, Mrs. Hittaway, whose husband was chairman of\nthe Board of Civil Appeals and who was very well known at all Boards\nand among official men generally, heard much more about things that\nwere going on than did her mother. And, having been emancipated from\nmaternal control for the last ten or twelve years, she could express\nherself before her mother with more confidence than would have become\nthe other girls. \"Mamma,\" she said, \"you don't mean it!\"\n\n\"I do mean it, Clara. Why should I not mean it?\"\n\n\"She is the greatest vixen in all London.\"\n\n\"Oh, Clara!\" said Augusta.\n\n\"And such a liar,\" said Mrs. Hittaway.\n\nThere came a look of pain across Lady Fawn's face, for Lady Fawn\nbelieved in her eldest daughter. But yet she intended to fight her\nground on a matter so important to her as was this. \"There is no word\nin the English language,\" she said, \"which conveys to me so little\nof defined meaning as that word vixen. If you can, tell me what you\nmean, Clara.\"\n\n\"Stop it, mamma.\"\n\n\"But why should I stop it,--even if I could?\"\n\n\"You don't know her, mamma.\"\n\n\"She has visited at Fawn Court, more than once. She is a friend of\nLucy's.\"\n\n\"If she is a friend of Lucy Morris, mamma, Lucy Morris shall never\ncome here.\"\n\n\"But what has she done? I have never heard that she has behaved\nimproperly. What does it all mean? She goes out everywhere. I don't\nthink she has had any lovers. Frederic would be the last man in the\nworld to throw himself away upon an ill-conditioned young woman.\"\n\n\"Frederic can see just as far as some other men, and not a bit\nfarther. Of course she has an income,--for her life.\"\n\n\"I believe it is her own altogether, Clara.\"\n\n\"She says so, I don't doubt. I believe she is the greatest liar about\nLondon. You find out about her jewels before she married poor Sir\nFlorian, and how much he had to pay for her; or rather, I'll find\nout. If you want to know, mamma, you just ask her own aunt, Lady\nLinlithgow.\"\n\n\"We all know, my dear, that Lady Linlithgow quarrelled with her.\"\n\n\"It's my belief that she is over head and ears in debt again. But\nI'll learn. And when I have found out, I shall not scruple to tell\nFrederic. Orlando will find out all about it.\" Orlando was the\nChristian name of Mrs. Hittaway's husband. \"Mr. Camperdown, I have\nno doubt, knows all the ins and outs of her story. The long and the\nshort of it is this, mamma, that I've heard quite enough about Lady\nEustace to feel certain that Frederic would live to repent it.\"\n\n\"But what can we do?\" said Lady Fawn.\n\n\"Break it off,\" said Mrs. Hittaway.\n\nHer daughter's violence of speech had a most depressing effect upon\npoor Lady Fawn. As has been said, she did believe in Mrs. Hittaway.\nShe knew that Mrs. Hittaway was conversant with the things of the\nworld, and heard tidings daily which never found their way down\nto Fawn Court. And yet her son went about quite as much as did\nher daughter. If Lady Eustace was such a reprobate as was now\nrepresented, why had not Lord Fawn heard the truth? And then she had\nalready given in her own adhesion, and had promised to call. \"Do you\nmean that you won't go to her?\" said Lady Fawn.\n\n\"As Lady Eustace,--certainly not. If Frederic does marry her, of\ncourse I must know her. That's a different thing. One has to make\nthe best one can of a bad bargain. I don't doubt they'd be separated\nbefore two years were over.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear, how dreadful!\" exclaimed Augusta.\n\nLady Fawn, after much consideration, was of opinion that she must\ncarry out her intention of calling upon her son's intended bride\nin spite of all the evil things that had been said. Lord Fawn had\nundertaken to send a message to Mount Street, informing the lady of\nthe honour intended for her. And in truth Lady Fawn was somewhat\ncurious now to see the household of the woman who might perhaps do\nher the irreparable injury of ruining the happiness of her only son.\nPerhaps she might learn something by looking at the woman in her own\ndrawing-room. At any rate she would go. But Mrs. Hittaway's words had\nthe effect of inducing her to leave Augusta where she was. If there\nwere contamination, why should Augusta be contaminated? Poor Augusta!\nShe had looked forward to the delight of embracing her future\nsister-in-law;--and would not have enjoyed it the less, perhaps,\nbecause she had been told that the lady was false, profligate, and a\nvixen. As, however, her position was that of a girl, she was bound to\nbe obedient,--though over thirty years old,--and she obeyed.\n\nLizzie was of course at home, and Miss Macnulty was of course\nvisiting the Horticultural Gardens or otherwise engaged. On such an\noccasion Lizzie would certainly be alone. She had taken great pains\nwith her dress, studying not so much her own appearance as the\ncharacter of her visitor. She was very anxious, at any rate for the\npresent, to win golden opinions from Lady Fawn. She was dressed\nrichly, but very simply. Everything about her room betokened wealth;\nbut she had put away the French novels, and had placed a Bible on\na little table, not quite hidden, behind her own seat. The long\nlustrous lock was tucked up, but the diamonds were still upon\nher fingers. She fully intended to make a conquest of her future\nmother-in-law and sister-in-law;--for the note which had come up to\nher from the India Office had told her that Augusta would accompany\nLady Fawn. \"Augusta is my favourite sister,\" said the enamoured\nlover, \"and I hope that you two will always be friends.\" Lizzie, when\nshe had read this, had declared to herself that of all the female\noafs she had ever seen, Augusta Fawn was the greatest oaf. When she\nfound that Lady Fawn was alone, she did not betray herself, or ask\nfor the beloved friend of the future. \"Dear, dear Lady Fawn!\" she\nsaid, throwing herself into the arms and nestling herself against the\nbosom of the old lady, \"this makes my happiness perfect.\" Then she\nretreated a little, still holding the hand she had grasped between\nher own, and looking up into the face of her future mother-in-law.\n\"When he asked me to be his wife, the first thing I thought of was\nwhether you would come to me at once.\" Her voice as she thus spoke\nwas perfect. Her manner was almost perfect. Perhaps there was a\nlittle too much of gesture, too much gliding motion, too violent an\nappeal with the eyes, too close a pressure of the hand. No suspicion,\nhowever, of all this would have touched Lady Fawn had she come to\nMount Street without calling in Warwick Square on the way. But those\nhorrible words of her daughter were ringing in her ears, and she did\nnot know how to conduct herself.\n\n\"Of course I came as soon as he told me,\" she said.\n\n\"And you will be a mother to me?\" demanded Lizzie.\n\nPoor Lady Fawn! There was enough of maternity about her to have\nenabled her to undertake the duty for a dozen sons' wives,--if the\nwives were women with whom she could feel sympathy. And she could\nfeel sympathy very easily; and was a woman not at all prone to\ninquire too curiously as to the merits of a son's wife. But what was\nshe to do after the caution she had received from Mrs. Hittaway? How\nwas she to promise maternal tenderness to a vixen and a liar? By\nnature she was not a deceitful woman. \"My dear,\" she said, \"I hope\nyou will make him a good wife.\"\n\nIt was not very encouraging, but Lizzie made the best of it. It was\nher desire to cheat Lady Fawn into a good opinion, and she was not\ndisappointed when no good opinion was expressed at once. It is seldom\nthat a bad person expects to be accounted good. It is the general\ndesire of such a one to conquer the existing evil impression; but it\nis generally presumed that the evil impression is there. \"Oh, Lady\nFawn!\" she said, \"I will so strive to make him happy. What is it that\nhe likes? What would he wish me to do and to be? You know his noble\nnature, and I must look to you for guidance.\"\n\nLady Fawn was embarrassed. She had now seated herself on the sofa,\nand Lizzie was close to her, almost enveloped within her mantle. \"My\ndear,\" said Lady Fawn, \"if you will endeavour to do your duty by him,\nI am sure he will do his by you.\"\n\n\"I know it. I am sure of it. And I will; I will. You will let me love\nyou, and call you mother?\" A peculiar perfume came up from Lizzie's\nhair which Lady Fawn did not like. Her own girls, perhaps, were not\ngiven to the use of much perfumery. She shifted her seat a little,\nand Lizzie was compelled to sit upright, and without support.\nHitherto Lady Fawn had said very little, and Lizzie's part was one\ndifficult to play. She had heard of that sermon read every Sunday\nevening at Fawn Court, and she believed that Lady Fawn was peculiarly\nreligious. \"There,\" she said, stretching out her hand backwards and\nclasping the book which lay upon the small table,--\"there; that\nshall be my guide. That will teach me how to do my duty by my noble\nhusband.\"\n\nLady Fawn in some surprise took the book from Lizzie's hand, and\nfound that it was the Bible. \"You certainly can't do better, my dear,\nthan read your Bible,\" said Lady Fawn,--but there was more of censure\nthan of eulogy in the tone of her voice. She put the Bible down very\nquietly, and asked Lady Eustace when it would suit her to come down\nto Fawn Court. Lady Fawn had promised her son to give the invitation,\nand could not now, she thought, avoid giving it.\n\n\"Oh, I should like it so much!\" said Lizzie. \"Whenever it will suit\nyou, I will be there at a minute's notice.\" It was then arranged\nthat she should be at Fawn Court on that day week, and stay for a\nfortnight. \"Of all things that which I most desire now,\" said Lizzie,\n\"is to know you and the dear girls,--and to be loved by you all.\"\n\nLady Eustace, as soon as she was alone in the room, stood in the\nmiddle of it, scowling,--for she could scowl. \"I'll not go near\nthem,\" she said to herself,--\"nasty, stupid, dull, puritanical\ndrones. If he don't like it, he may lump it. After all it's no such\ngreat catch.\" Then she sat down to reflect whether it was or was not\na catch. As soon as ever Lord Fawn had left her after the engagement\nwas made, she had begun to tell herself that he was a poor creature,\nand that she had done wrong. \"Only five thousand a year!\" she said\nto herself;--for she had not perfectly understood that little\nexplanation which he had given respecting his income. \"It's nothing\nfor a lord.\" And now again she murmured to herself, \"It's my money\nhe's after. He'll find out that I know how to keep what I've got in\nmy own hands.\" Now that Lady Fawn had been cold to her, she thought\nstill less of the proposed marriage. But there was this inducement\nfor her to go on with it. If they, the Fawn women, thought that they\ncould break it off, she would let them know that they had no such\npower.\n\n\"Well, mamma, you've seen her?\" said Mrs. Hittaway.\n\n\"Yes, my dear; I've seen her. I had seen her two or three times\nbefore, you know.\"\n\n\"And you are still in love with her?\"\n\n\"I never said that I was in love with her, Clara.\"\n\n\"And what has been fixed?\"\n\n\"She is to come down to Fawn Court next week, and stay a fortnight\nwith us. Then we shall find out what she is.\"\n\n\"That will be best, mamma,\" said Augusta.\n\n\"Mind, mamma; you understand me. I shall tell Frederic plainly just\nwhat I think. Of course he will be offended, and if the marriage goes\non, the offence will remain,--till he finds out the truth.\"\n\n\"I hope he'll find out no such truth,\" said Lady Fawn. She was,\nhowever, quite unable to say a word in behalf of her future\ndaughter-in-law. She said nothing as to that little scene with the\nBible, but she never forgot it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nLizzie and Her Lover\n\n\nDuring the remainder of that Monday and all the Tuesday, Lizzie's\nmind was, upon the whole, averse to matrimony. She had told Miss\nMacnulty of her prospects, with some amount of exultation; and the\npoor dependant, though she knew that she must be turned out into the\nstreet, had congratulated her patroness. \"The Vulturess will take\nyou in again, when she knows you've nowhere else to go,\" Lizzie had\nsaid,--displaying, indeed, some accurate discernment of her aunt's\ncharacter. But after Lady Fawn's visit she spoke of the marriage in a\ndifferent tone. \"Of course, my dear, I shall have to look very close\nafter the settlement.\"\n\n\"I suppose the lawyers will do that,\" said Miss Macnulty.\n\n\"Yes;--lawyers! That's all very well. I know what lawyers are. I'm\nnot going to trust any lawyer to give away my property. Of course we\nshall live at Portray, because his place is in Ireland;--and nothing\nshall take me to Ireland. I told him that from the very first. But I\ndon't mean to give up my own income. I don't suppose he'll venture to\nsuggest such a thing.\" And then again she grumbled. \"It's all very\nwell being in the Cabinet--!\"\n\n\"Is Lord Fawn in the Cabinet?\" asked Miss Macnulty, who in such\nmatters was not altogether ignorant.\n\n\"Of course he is,\" said Lizzie, with an angry gesture. It may\nseem unjust to accuse her of being stupidly unacquainted with\ncircumstances, and a liar at the same time; but she was both. She\nsaid that Lord Fawn was in the Cabinet because she had heard some\none speak of him as not being a Cabinet Minister, and in so speaking\nappear to slight his political position. Lizzie did not know how much\nher companion knew, and Miss Macnulty did not comprehend the depth of\nthe ignorance of her patroness. Thus the lies which Lizzie told were\namazing to Miss Macnulty. To say that Lord Fawn was in the Cabinet,\nwhen all the world knew that he was an Under-Secretary! What good\ncould a woman get from an assertion so plainly, so manifestly false?\nBut Lizzie knew nothing of Under-Secretaries. Lord Fawn was a lord,\nand even commoners were in the Cabinet. \"Of course he is,\" said\nLizzie; \"but I sha'n't have my drawing-room made a Cabinet. They\nsha'n't come here.\" And then again on the Tuesday evening she\ndisplayed her independence. \"As for those women down at Richmond, I\ndon't mean to be overrun by them, I can tell you. I said I would go\nthere, and of course I shall keep my word.\"\n\n\"I think you had better go,\" said Miss Macnulty.\n\n\"Of course, I shall go. I don't want anybody to tell me where I'm to\ngo, my dear, and where I'm not. But it'll be about the first and the\nlast visit. And as for bringing those dowdy girls out in London, it's\nthe last thing I shall think of doing. Indeed, I doubt whether they\ncan afford to dress themselves.\" As she went up to bed on the Tuesday\nevening, Miss Macnulty doubted whether the match would go on. She\nnever believed her friend's statements; but if spoken words might\nbe supposed to mean anything, Lady Eustace's words on that Tuesday\nbetokened a strong dislike to everything appertaining to the Fawn\nfamily. She had even ridiculed Lord Fawn himself, declaring that he\nunderstood nothing about anything beyond his office.\n\nAnd, in truth, Lizzie almost had made up her mind to break it off.\nAll that she would gain did not seem to weigh down with sufficient\npreponderance all that she would lose. Such were her feelings on the\nTuesday night. But on the Wednesday morning she received a note which\nthrew her back violently upon the Fawn interest. The note was as\nfollows: \"Messrs. Camperdown and Son present their compliments to\nLady Eustace. They have received instructions to proceed by law for\nthe recovery of the Eustace diamonds, now in Lady Eustace's hands,\nand will feel obliged to Lady Eustace if she will communicate to\nthem the name and address of her attorney. 62, New Square, May 30,\n186--.\" The effect of this note was to drive Lizzie back upon the\nFawn interest. She was frightened about the diamonds, and was,\nnevertheless, almost determined not to surrender them. At any rate,\nin such a strait she would want assistance, either in keeping them or\nin giving them up. The lawyer's letter afflicted her with a sense of\nweakness, and there was strength in the Fawn connexion. As Lord Fawn\nwas so poor, perhaps he would adhere to the jewels. She knew that she\ncould not fight Mr. Camperdown with no other assistance than what\nMessrs. Mowbray and Mopus might give her, and therefore her heart\nsoftened towards her betrothed. \"I suppose Frederic will be here\nto-day,\" she said to Miss Macnulty, as they sat at breakfast together\nabout noon. Miss Macnulty nodded. \"You can have a cab, you know, if\nyou like to go anywhere.\" Miss Macnulty said she thought she would\ngo to the National Gallery. \"And you can walk back, you know,\" said\nLizzie. \"I can walk there and back too,\" said Miss Macnulty,--in\nregard to whom it may be said that the last ounce would sometimes\nalmost break the horse's back.\n\n\"Frederic\" came and was received very graciously. Lizzie had placed\nMr. Camperdown's note on the little table behind her, beneath the\nBible, so that she might put her hand upon it at once, if she could\nmake an opportunity of showing it to her future husband. \"Frederic\"\nsat himself beside her, and the intercourse for awhile was such as\nmight be looked for between two lovers of whom one was a widow, and\nthe other an Under-Secretary of State from the India Office. They\nwere loving, but discreetly amatory, talking chiefly of things\nmaterial, each flattering the other, and each hinting now and again\nat certain little circumstances of which a more accurate knowledge\nseemed to be desirable. The one was conversant with things in\ngeneral, but was slow; the other was quick as a lizard in turning\nhither and thither, but knew almost nothing. When she told Lord Fawn\nthat the Ayrshire estate was \"her own, to do what she liked with,\"\nshe did not know that he would certainly find out the truth from\nother sources before he married her. Indeed, she was not quite sure\nherself whether the statement was true or false, though she would not\nhave made it so frequently had her idea of the truth been a fixed\nidea. It had all been explained to her;--but there had been something\nabout a second son, and there was no second son. Perhaps she might\nhave a second son yet,--a future little Lord Fawn, and he might\ninherit it. In regard to honesty, the man was superior to the woman,\nbecause his purpose was declared, and he told no lies;--but the one\nwas as mercenary as the other. It was not love that had brought Lord\nFawn to Mount Street.\n\n\"What is the name of your place in Ireland?\" she asked.\n\n\"There is no house, you know.\"\n\n\"But there was one, Frederic?\"\n\n\"The town-land where the house used to be, is called Killeagent. The\nold demesne is called Killaud.\"\n\n\"What pretty names! and--and--does it go a great many miles?\"\nLord Fawn explained that it did run a good many miles up into the\nmountains. \"How beautifully romantic!\" said Lizzie. \"But the people\nlive on the mountain and pay rent?\"\n\nLord Fawn asked no such inept questions respecting the Ayrshire\nproperty, but he did inquire who was Lizzie's solicitor. \"Of course\nthere will be things to be settled,\" he said, \"and my lawyer had\nbetter see yours. Mr. Camperdown is a--\"\n\n\"Mr. Camperdown!\" almost shrieked Lizzie. Lord Fawn then explained,\nwith some amazement, that Mr. Camperdown was his lawyer. As far as\nhis belief went, there was not a more respectable gentleman in the\nprofession. Then he inquired whether Lizzie had any objection to Mr.\nCamperdown. \"Mr. Camperdown was Sir Florian's lawyer,\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"That will make it all the easier, I should think,\" said Lord Fawn.\n\n\"I don't know how that may be,\" said Lizzie, trying to bring her mind\nto work upon the subject steadily. \"Mr. Camperdown has been very\nuncourteous to me;--I must say that; and, as I think, unfair. He\nwishes to rob me now of a thing that is quite my own.\"\n\n\"What sort of a thing?\" asked Lord Fawn slowly.\n\n\"A very valuable thing. I'll tell you all about it, Frederic. Of\ncourse I'll tell you everything now. I never could keep back anything\nfrom one that I loved. It's not my nature. There; you might as\nwell read that note.\" Then she put her hand back and brought Mr.\nCamperdown's letter from under the Bible. Lord Fawn read it very\nattentively, and as he read it there came upon him a great doubt.\nWhat sort of woman was this to whom he had engaged himself because\nshe was possessed of an income? That Mr. Camperdown should be in the\nwrong in such a matter was an idea which never occurred to Lord Fawn.\nThere is no form of belief stronger than that which the ordinary\nEnglish gentleman has in the discretion and honesty of his own family\nlawyer. What his lawyer tells him to do, he does. What his lawyer\ntells him to sign, he signs. He buys and sells in obedience to the\nsame direction, and feels perfectly comfortable in the possession of\na guide who is responsible and all but divine. \"What diamonds are\nthey?\" asked Lord Fawn in a very low voice.\n\n\"They are my own,--altogether my own. Sir Florian gave them to me.\nWhen he put them into my hands, he said that they were to be my own\nfor ever and ever. 'There,' said he,--'those are yours to do what you\nchoose with them.' After that they oughtn't to ask me to give them\nback,--ought they? If you had been married before, and your wife had\ngiven you a keepsake,--to keep for ever and ever, would you give it\nup to a lawyer? You would not like it;--would you, Frederic?\" She had\nput her hand on his, and was looking up into his face as she asked\nthe question. Again, perhaps, the acting was a little overdone; but\nthere were the tears in her eyes, and the tone of her voice was\nperfect.\n\n\"Mr. Camperdown calls them Eustace diamonds,--family diamonds,\" said\nLord Fawn. \"What do they consist of? What are they worth?\"\n\n\"I'll show them to you,\" said Lizzie, jumping up and hurrying out of\nthe room. Lord Fawn, when he was alone, rubbed his hands over his\neyes and thought about it all. It would be a very harsh measure,\non the part of the Eustace family and of Mr. Camperdown, to demand\nfrom her the surrender of any trinket which her late husband might\nhave given her in the manner she had described. But it was, to his\nthinking, most improbable that the Eustace people or the lawyer\nshould be harsh to a widow bearing the Eustace name. The Eustaces\nwere by disposition lavish, and old Mr. Camperdown was not one who\nwould be strict in claiming little things for rich clients. And yet\nhere was his letter, threatening the widow of the late baronet with\nlegal proceedings for the recovery of jewels which had been given by\nSir Florian himself to his wife as a keepsake! Perhaps Sir Florian\nhad made some mistake, and had caused to be set in a ring or brooch\nfor his bride some jewel which he had thought to be his own, but\nwhich had, in truth, been an heirloom. If so, the jewel should, of\ncourse, be surrendered,--or replaced by one of equal value. He was\nmaking out some such solution, when Lizzie returned with the morocco\ncase in her hand. \"It was the manner in which he gave it to me,\" said\nLizzie, as she opened the clasp, \"which makes its value to me.\"\n\nLord Fawn knew nothing about jewels, but even he knew that if the\ncircle of stones which he saw, with a Maltese cross appended to it,\nwas constituted of real diamonds, the thing must be of great value.\nAnd it occurred to him at once that such a necklace is not given by a\nhusband even to a bride in the manner described by Lizzie. A ring, or\nbrooch, or perhaps a bracelet, a lover or a loving lord may bring in\nhis pocket. But such an ornament as this on which Lord Fawn was now\nlooking, is given in another sort of way. He felt sure that it was\nso, even though he was entirely ignorant of the value of the stones.\n\"Do you know what it is worth?\" he asked.\n\nLizzie hesitated a moment, and then remembered that \"Frederic,\" in\nhis present position in regard to herself, might be glad to assist\nher in maintaining the possession of a substantial property. \"I think\nthey say its value is about--ten thousand pounds,\" she replied.\n\n\"Ten--thousand--pounds!\" Lord Fawn riveted his eyes upon them.\n\n\"That's what I am told--by a jeweller.\"\n\n\"By what jeweller?\"\n\n\"A man had to come and see them,--about some repairs,--or something\nof that kind. Poor Sir Florian wished it. And he said so.\"\n\n\"What was the man's name?\"\n\n\"I forget his name,\" said Lizzie, who was not quite sure whether her\nacquaintance with Mr. Benjamin would be considered respectable.\n\n\"Ten thousand pounds! You don't keep them in the house;--do you?\"\n\n\"I have an iron case up-stairs for them;--ever so heavy.\"\n\n\"And did Sir Florian give you the iron case?\"\n\nLizzie hesitated for a moment. \"Yes,\" said she. \"That is,--no. But he\nordered it to be made; and then it came,--after he was--dead.\"\n\n\"He knew their value, then?\"\n\n\"Oh, dear, yes. Though he never named any sum. He told me, however,\nthat they were very--very valuable.\"\n\nLord Fawn did not immediately recognise the falseness of every word\nthat the woman said to him, because he was slow and could not think\nand hear at the same time. But he was at once involved in a painful\nmaze of doubt and almost of dismay. An action for the recovery of\njewels brought against the lady whom he was engaged to marry, on\nbehalf of the family of her late husband, would not suit him at all.\nTo have his hands quite clean, to be above all evil report, to be\nrespectable, as it were, all round, was Lord Fawn's special ambition.\nHe was a poor man, and a greedy man, but he would have abandoned his\nofficial salary at a moment's notice, rather than there should have\nfallen on him a breath of public opinion hinting that it ought to be\nabandoned. He was especially timid, and lived in a perpetual fear\nlest the newspapers should say something hard of him. In that matter\nof the Sawab he had been very wretched, because Frank Greystock had\naccused him of being an administrator of tyranny. He would have liked\nhis wife to have ten thousand pounds' worth of diamonds very well;\nbut he would rather go without a wife for ever,--and without a wife's\nfortune,--than marry a woman subject to an action for claiming\ndiamonds not her own. \"I think,\" said he, at last, \"that if you were\nto put them into Mr. Camperdown's hands--\"\n\n\"Into Mr. Camperdown's hands!\"\n\n\"And then let the matter be settled by arbitration--\"\n\n\"Arbitration? That means going to law?\"\n\n\"No, dearest,--that means not going to law. The diamonds would be\nentrusted to Mr. Camperdown. And then some one would be appointed to\ndecide whose property they were.\"\n\n\"They're my property,\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"But he says they belong to the family.\"\n\n\"He'll say anything,\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"My dearest girl, there can't be a more respectable man than Mr.\nCamperdown. You must do something of the kind, you know.\"\n\n\"I sha'n't do anything of the kind,\" said Lizzie. \"Sir Florian\nEustace gave them to me, and I shall keep them.\" She did not look\nat her lover as she spoke; but he looked at her, and did not like\nthe change which he saw on her countenance. And he did not like\nthe circumstances in which he found himself placed. \"Why should Mr.\nCamperdown interfere?\" continued Lizzie. \"If they don't belong to me,\nthey belong to my son;--and who has so good a right to keep them for\nhim as I have? But they belong to me.\"\n\n\"They should not be kept in a private house like this at all, if they\nare worth all that money.\"\n\n\"If I were to let them go, Mr. Camperdown would get them. There's\nnothing he wouldn't do to get them. Oh, Frederic, I hope you'll stand\nto me, and not see me injured. Of course I only want them for my\ndarling child.\"\n\nFrederic's face had become very long, and he was much disturbed in\nhis mind. He could only suggest that he himself would go and see Mr.\nCamperdown, and ascertain what ought to be done. To the last, he\nadhered to his assurance that Mr. Camperdown could do no evil;--till\nLizzie, in her wrath, asked him whether he believed Mr. Camperdown's\nword before hers. \"I think he would understand a matter of business\nbetter than you,\" said the prudent lover.\n\n\"He wants to rob me,\" said Lizzie, \"and I shall look to you to\nprevent it.\"\n\nWhen Lord Fawn took his leave,--which he did not do till he\nhad counselled her again and again to leave the matter in Mr.\nCamperdown's hands,--the two were not in good accord together. It was\nhis fixed purpose, as he declared to her, to see Mr. Camperdown; and\nit was her fixed purpose,--so, at least, she declared to him,--to\nkeep the diamonds, in spite of Mr. Camperdown. \"But, my dear, if it's\ndecided against you--\" said Lord Fawn gravely.\n\n\"It can't be decided against me, if you stand by me as you ought to\ndo.\"\n\n\"I can do nothing,\" said Lord Fawn, in a tremor. Then Lizzie looked\nat him,--and her look, which was very eloquent, called him a poltroon\nas plain as a look could speak. Then they parted, and the signs of\naffection between them were not satisfactory.\n\nThe door was hardly closed behind him before Lizzie began to declare\nto herself that he shouldn't escape her. It was not yet twenty-four\nhours since she had been telling herself that she did not like the\nengagement and would break it off; and now she was stamping her\nlittle feet, and clenching her little hands, and swearing to herself\nby all her gods, that this wretched, timid lordling should not get\nout of her net. She did, in truth, despise him because he would not\nclutch the jewels. She looked upon him as mean and paltry because he\nwas willing to submit to Mr. Camperdown. But still she was prompted\nto demand all that could be demanded from her engagement,--because\nshe thought that she perceived a something in him which might\nproduce in him a desire to be relieved from it. No! he should not be\nrelieved. He should marry her. And she would keep the key of that\niron box with the diamonds, and he should find what sort of a noise\nshe would make if he attempted to take it from her. She closed the\nmorocco case, ascended with it to her bed-room, locked it up in the\niron safe, deposited the little patent key in its usual place round\nher neck, and then seated herself at her desk, and wrote letters to\nher various friends, making known to them her engagement. Hitherto\nshe had told no one but Miss Macnulty,--and, in her doubts, had gone\nso far as to desire Miss Macnulty not to mention it. Now she was\nresolved to blazon forth her engagement before all the world.\n\nThe first \"friend\" to whom she wrote was Lady Linlithgow. The reader\nshall see two or three of her letters, and that to the countess shall\nbe the first.\n\n\n   MY DEAR AUNT,\n\n   When you came to see me the other day, I cannot say that\n   you were very kind to me, and I don't suppose you care\n   very much what becomes of me. But I think it right to\n   let you know that I am going to be married. I am engaged\n   to Lord Fawn, who, as you know, is a peer, and a member\n   of Her Majesty's Government, and a nobleman of great\n   influence. I do not suppose that even you can say anything\n   against such an alliance.\n\n   I am, your affectionate niece,\n\n   ELI. EUSTACE.\n\n\nThen she wrote to Mrs. Eustace, the wife of the Bishop of\nBobsborough. Mrs. Eustace had been very kind to her in the first\ndays of her widowhood, and had fully recognised her as the widow\nof the head of her husband's family. Lizzie had liked none of\nthe Bobsborough people. They were, according to her ideas, slow,\nrespectable, and dull. But they had not found much open fault with\nher, and she was aware that it was for her interest to remain on good\nterms with them. Her letter, therefore, to Mrs. Eustace was somewhat\nless acrid than that written to her aunt Linlithgow.\n\n\n   MY DEAR MRS. EUSTACE,\n\n   I hope you will be glad to hear from me, and will not be\n   sorry to hear my news. I am going to be married again. Of\n   course I am not about to take a step which is in every way\n   so very important without thinking about it a great deal.\n   But I am sure it will be better for my darling little\n   Florian in every way; and as for myself, I have felt for\n   the last two years how unfitted I have been to manage\n   everything myself. I have therefore accepted an offer\n   made to me by Lord Fawn, who is, as you know, a peer\n   of Parliament, and a most distinguished member of Her\n   Majesty's Government; and he is, too, a nobleman of very\n   great influence in every respect, and has a property in\n   Ireland, extending over ever so many miles, and running up\n   into the mountains. His mansion there is called Killmage,\n   but I am not sure that I remember the name quite rightly.\n   I hope I may see you there some day, and the dear bishop.\n   I look forward with delight to doing something to make\n   those dear Irish happier. The idea of rambling up into our\n   own mountains charms me, for nothing suits my disposition\n   so well as that kind of solitude.\n\n   Of course Lord Fawn is not so rich a man as Sir Florian,\n   but I have never looked to riches for my happiness. Not\n   but what Lord Fawn has a good income from his Irish\n   estates; and then, of course, he is paid for doing Her\n   Majesty's Government;--so there is no fear that he will\n   have to live upon my jointure, which, of course, would not\n   be right. Pray tell the dear bishop and dear Margaretta\n   all this, with my love. You will be happy, I know, to hear\n   that my little Flo is quite well. He is already so fond of\n   his new papa! [Lizzie's turn for lying was exemplified in\n   this last statement, for, as it happened, Lord Fawn had\n   never yet seen the child.]\n\n   Believe me to be always your most affectionate niece,\n\n   ELI. EUSTACE.\n\n\nThere were two other letters,--one to her uncle, the dean, and the\nother to her cousin Frank. There was great doubt in her mind as to\nthe expediency of writing to Frank Greystock; but at last she decided\nthat she would do it. The letter to the dean need not be given in\nfull, as it was very similar to that written to the bishop's wife.\nThe same mention was made of her intended husband's peerage, and the\nsame allusion to Her Majesty's Government,--a phrase which she had\nheard from Lord Fawn himself. She spoke of the Irish property, but\nin terms less glowing than she had used in writing to the lady, and\nended by asking for her uncle's congratulation--and blessing. Her\nletter to Frank was as follows, and, doubtless, as she wrote it,\nthere was present to her mind a remembrance of the fact that he\nhimself might have offered to her, and have had her if he would.\n\n\n   MY DEAR COUSIN,\n\n   As I would rather that you should hear my news from myself\n   than from any one else, I write to tell you that I am\n   going to be married to Lord Fawn. Of course I know that\n   there are certain matters as to which you and Lord Fawn do\n   not agree,--in politics, I mean; but still I do not doubt\n   but you will think that he is quite able to take care of\n   your poor little cousin. It was only settled a day or\n   two since, but it has been coming on ever so long. You\n   understand all about that;--don't you? Of course you\n   must come to my wedding, and be very good to me,--a\n   kind of brother, you know; for we have always been\n   friends;--haven't we? And if the dean doesn't come up to\n   town, you must give me away. And you must come and see me\n   ever so often; for I have a sort of feeling that I have\n   no one else belonging to me that I can call really my\n   own, except you. And you must be great friends with Lord\n   Fawn, and must give up saying that he doesn't do his work\n   properly. Of course he does everything better than anybody\n   else could possibly do it,--except Cousin Frank.\n\n   I am going down next week to Richmond. Lady Fawn has\n   insisted on my staying there for a fortnight. Oh, dear,\n   what shall I do all the time? You must positively come\n   down and see me,--and see somebody else too! Only, you\n   naughty coz! you mustn't break a poor girl's heart.\n\n   Your affectionate cousin,\n\n   ELI. EUSTACE.\n\n\nSomebody, in speaking on Lady Eustace's behalf, and making the best\nof her virtues, had declared that she did not have lovers. Hitherto\nthat had been true of her;--but her mind had not the less dwelt on\nthe delight of a lover. She still thought of a possible Corsair who\nwould be willing to give up all but his vices for her love, and\nfor whose sake she would be willing to share even them. It was but\na dream, but nevertheless it pervaded her fancy constantly. Lord\nFawn,--peer of Parliament, and member of Her Majesty's Government,\nas he was,--could not have been such a lover to her. Might it not\nbe possible that there should exist something of romance between\nher and her cousin Frank? She was the last woman in the world to\nrun away with a man, or to endanger her position by a serious\nindiscretion; but there might, perhaps, be a something between her\nand her cousin,--a liaison quite correct in its facts, a secret\nunderstanding, if nothing more,--a mutual sympathy, which should be\nchiefly shown in the abuse of all their friends,--and in this she\ncould indulge her passion for romance and poetry.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nLord Fawn at His Office\n\n\nThe news was soon all about London,--as Lizzie had intended. She had\nmade a sudden resolve that Lord Fawn should not escape her, and she\nhad gone to work after the fashion we have seen. Frank Greystock had\ntold John Eustace, and John Eustace had told Mr. Camperdown before\nLord Fawn himself, in the slow prosecution of his purpose, had\nconsulted the lawyer about the necklace. \"God bless my soul;--Lord\nFawn!\" the old lawyer had said when the news was communicated to him.\n\"Well,--yes;--he wants money. I don't envy him; that's all. We shall\nget the diamonds now, John. Lord Fawn isn't the man to let his wife\nkeep what doesn't belong to her.\" Then, after a day or two, Lord Fawn\nhad himself gone to Mr. Camperdown's chambers. \"I believe I am to\ncongratulate you, my lord,\" said the lawyer. \"I'm told you are going\nto marry--; well, I mustn't really say another of my clients, but the\nwidow of one of them. Lady Eustace is a very beautiful woman, and she\nhas a very pretty income too. She has the whole of the Scotch\nproperty for her life.\"\n\n\"It's only for her life, I suppose?\" said Lord Fawn.\n\n\"Oh, no, no;--of course not. There's been some mistake on her\npart;--at least, so I've been told. Women never understand. It's\nall as clear as daylight. Had there been a second son, the second\nson would have had it. As it is, it goes with the rest of the\nproperty--just as it ought to do, you know. Four thousand a year\nisn't so bad, you know, considering that she isn't more than a girl\nyet, and that she hadn't sixpence of her own. When the admiral died,\nthere wasn't sixpence, Lord Fawn.\"\n\n\"So I have heard.\"\n\n\"Not sixpence. It's all Eustace money. She had six or eight thousand\npounds, or something like that, besides. She's as lovely a young\nwidow as I ever saw,--and very clever.\"\n\n\"Yes;--she is clever.\"\n\n\"By-the-bye, Lord Fawn, as you have done me the honour of\ncalling,--there's a stupid mistake about some family diamonds.\"\n\n\"It is in respect to them that I've come,\" said Lord Fawn. Then Mr.\nCamperdown, in his easy, off-hand way, imputing no blame to the lady\nin the hearing of her future husband, and declaring his opinion that\nshe was doubtless unaware of its value, explained the matter of the\nnecklace. Lord Fawn listened, but said very little. He especially did\nnot say that Lady Eustace had had the stones valued. \"They're real, I\nsuppose?\" he asked. Mr. Camperdown assured him that no diamonds more\nreal had ever come from Golconda, or passed through Mr. Garnett's\nhands. \"They are as well known as any family diamonds in England,\"\nsaid Mr. Camperdown. \"She has got into bad hands,\"--continued Mr.\nCamperdown. \"Mowbray and Mopus;--horrible people; sharks, that make\none blush for one's profession; and I was really afraid there would\nhave been trouble. But, of course, it'll be all right now;--and if\nshe'll only come to me, tell her I'll do everything I can to make\nthings straight and comfortable for her. If she likes to have another\nlawyer, of course, that's all right. Only make her understand who\nMowbray and Mopus are. It's quite out of the question, Lord Fawn,\nthat your wife should have anything to do with Mowbray and Mopus.\"\nEvery word that Mr. Camperdown said was gospel to Lord Fawn.\n\nAnd yet, as the reader will understand, Mr. Camperdown had by no\nmeans expressed his real opinion in this interview. He had spoken of\nthe widow in friendly terms,--declaring that she was simply mistaken\nin her ideas as to the duration of her interest in the Scotch\nproperty, and mistaken again about the diamonds;--whereas in truth he\nregarded her as a dishonest, lying, evil-minded harpy. Had Lord Fawn\nconsulted him simply as a client, and not have come to him an engaged\nlover, he would have expressed his opinion quite frankly; but it is\nnot the business of a lawyer to tell his client evil things of the\nlady whom that client is engaged to marry. In regard to the property\nhe spoke the truth, and he spoke what he believed to be the truth\nwhen he said that the whole thing would no doubt now be easily\narranged. When Lord Fawn took his leave, Mr. Camperdown again\ndeclared to himself that as regarded money the match was very well\nfor his lordship; but that, as regarded the woman, Lizzie was dear\nat the price. \"Perhaps he doesn't mind it,\" said Mr. Camperdown to\nhimself, \"but I wouldn't marry such a woman myself, though she owned\nall Scotland.\"\n\nThere had been much in the interview to make Lord Fawn unhappy.\nIn the first place, that golden hope as to the perpetuity of the\nproperty was at an end. He had never believed that it was so; but a\nman may hope without believing. And he was quite sure that Lizzie was\nbound to give up the diamonds,--and would ultimately be made to give\nthem up. Of any property in them, as possibly accruing to himself,\nhe had not thought much;--but he could not abstain from thinking of\nthe woman's grasp upon them. Mr. Camperdown's plain statement, which\nwas gospel to him, was directly at variance with Lizzie's story. Sir\nFlorian certainly would not have given such diamonds in such a way.\nSir Florian would not have ordered a separate iron safe for them,\nwith a view that they might be secure in his wife's bed-room. And\nthen she had had them valued, and manifestly was always thinking of\nher treasure. It was very well for a poor, careful peer to be always\nthinking of his money, but Lord Fawn was well aware that a young\nwoman such as Lady Eustace should have her thoughts elsewhere. As he\nsat signing letters at the India Board, relieving himself when he was\nleft alone between each batch by standing up with his back to the\nfire-place, his mind was full of all this. He could not unravel truth\nquickly, but he could grasp it when it came to him. She was certainly\ngreedy, false, and dishonest. And,--worse than all this,--she had\ndared to tell him to his face that he was a poor creature because he\nwould not support her in her greed, and falsehoods, and dishonesty!\nNevertheless, he was engaged to marry her! Then he thought of one\nViolet Effingham whom he had loved, and then came over him some\nsuspicion of a fear that he himself was hard and selfish. And yet\nwhat was such a one as he to do? It was of course necessary for the\nmaintenance of the very constitution of his country that there should\nbe future Lord Fawns. There could be no future Lord Fawns unless he\nmarried;--and how could he marry without money? \"A peasant can marry\nwhom he pleases,\" said Lord Fawn, pressing his hand to his brow, and\ndropping one flap of his coat, as he thought of his own high and\nperilous destiny, standing with his back to the fire-place, while a\nhuge pile of letters lay there before him waiting to be signed.\n\nIt was a Saturday evening, and as there was no House there was\nnothing to hurry him away from the office. He was the occupier for\nthe time of a large, well-furnished official room, looking out into\nSt. James's Park, and as he glanced round it he told himself that his\nown happiness must be there, and not in the domesticity of a quiet\nhome. The House of Lords, out of which nobody could turn him, and\nofficial life,--as long as he could hold to it,--must be all in all\nto him. He had engaged himself to this woman, and he must--marry\nher. He did not think that he could now see any way of avoiding that\nevent. Her income would supply the needs of her home, and then there\nmight probably be a continuation of Lord Fawns. The world might have\ndone better for him,--had he been able to find favour in Violet\nEffingham's sight. He was a man capable of love,--and very capable\nof constancy to a woman true to him. Then he wiped away a tear as he\nsat down to sign the huge batch of letters. As he read some special\nletter in which instructions were conveyed as to the insufficiency\nof the Sawab's claims, he thought of Frank Greystock's attack upon\nhim, and of Frank Greystock's cousin. There had been a time in\nwhich he had feared that the two cousins would become man and wife.\nAt this moment he uttered a malediction against the member for\nBobsborough, which might perhaps have been spared had the member\nbeen now willing to take the lady off his hands. Then the door was\nopened, and the messenger told him that Mrs. Hittaway was in the\nwaiting-room. Mrs. Hittaway was, of course, at once made welcome to\nthe Under-Secretary's own apartment.\n\nMrs. Hittaway was a strong-minded woman,--the strongest-minded\nprobably of the Fawn family,--but she had now come upon a task\nwhich taxed all her strength to the utmost. She had told her mother\nthat she would tell \"Frederic\" what she thought about his proposed\nbride, and she had now come to carry out her threat. She had asked\nher brother to come and dine with her, but he had declined. His\nengagements hardly admitted of his dining with his relatives. She had\ncalled upon him at the rooms he occupied in Victoria Street,--but\nof course she had not found him. She could not very well go to his\nclub;--so now she had hunted him down at his office. From the very\ncommencement of the interview Mrs. Hittaway was strong-minded. She\nbegan the subject of the marriage, and did so without a word of\ncongratulation. \"Dear Frederic,\" she said, \"you know that we have all\ngot to look up to you.\"\n\n\"Well, Clara,--what does that mean?\"\n\n\"It means this,--that you must bear with me, if I am more anxious as\nto your future career than another sister might be.\"\n\n\"Now I know you are going to say something unpleasant.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am, Frederic. I have heard so many bad things about Lady\nEustace!\"\n\nThe Under-Secretary sat silent for awhile in his great arm-chair.\n\"What sort of evil things do you mean, Clara?\" he asked at last.\n\"Evil things are said of a great many people,--as you know. I am sure\nyou would not wish to repeat slanders.\"\n\nMrs. Hittaway was not to be silenced after this fashion. \"Not\nslanders, certainly, Frederic. But when I hear that you intend to\nraise this lady to the rank and position of your wife, then of course\nthe truth or falsehood of these reports becomes a matter of great\nmoment to us all. Don't you think you had better see Mr. Camperdown?\"\n\n\"I have seen him.\"\n\n\"And what does he say?\"\n\n\"What should he say? Lady Eustace has, I believe, made some mistake\nabout the condition of her property, and people who have heard it\nhave been good-natured enough to say that the error has been wilful.\nThat is what I call slander, Clara.\"\n\n\"And have you heard about her jewels?\" Mrs. Hittaway was alluding\nhere to the report which had reached her as to Lizzie's debt to\nHarter and Benjamin when she married Sir Florian; but Lord Fawn of\ncourse thought of the diamond necklace.\n\n\"Yes;\" said he, \"I have heard all about them. Who told you?\"\n\n\"I have known it ever so long. Sir Florian never got over it.\" Lord\nFawn was again in the dark, but he did not choose to commit himself\nby asking further questions. \"And then her treatment of Lady\nLinlithgow, who was her only friend before she married, was something\nquite unnatural. Ask the dean's people what they think of her. I\nbelieve even they would tell you.\"\n\n\"Frank Greystock desired to marry her himself.\"\n\n\"Yes,--for her money, perhaps;--because he has not got a farthing in\nthe world. Dear Frederic, I only wish to put you on your guard. Of\ncourse this is very unpleasant, and I shouldn't do it if I didn't\nthink it my duty. I believe she is artful and very false. She\ncertainly deceived Sir Florian Eustace about her debts;--and he never\nheld up his head after he found out what she was. If she has told you\nfalsehoods, of course you can break it off. Dear Frederic, I hope you\nwon't be angry with me.\"\n\n\"Is that all?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes;--that is all.\"\n\n\"I'll bear it in mind,\" he said. \"Of course it isn't very pleasant.\"\n\n\"No;--I know it is not pleasant,\" said Mrs. Hittaway, rising, and\ntaking her departure with an offer of affectionate sisterly greeting,\nwhich was not accepted with cordiality.\n\nIt was very unpleasant. That very morning Lord Fawn had received\nletters from the Dean and the Bishop of Bobsborough congratulating\nhim on his intended marriage,--both those worthy dignitaries of the\nChurch having thought it expedient to verify Lizzie's statements.\nLord Fawn was, therefore, well aware that Lady Eustace had published\nthe engagement. It was known to everybody, and could not be broken\noff without public scandal.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\"I Only Thought of It\"\n\n\nThere was great perturbation down at Fawn Court. On the day fixed,\nMonday, June 5, Lizzie arrived. Nothing further had been said by Lady\nFawn to urge the invitation; but, in accordance with the arrangement\nalready made, Lady Eustace, with her child, her nurse, and her own\nmaid, was at Fawn Court by four o'clock. A very long letter had been\nreceived from Mrs. Hittaway that morning,--the writing of which\nmust have seriously interfered with the tranquillity of her Sunday\nafternoon. Lord Fawn did not make his appearance at Richmond on the\nSaturday evening,--nor was he seen on the Sunday. That Sunday was,\nwe may presume, chiefly devoted to reflection. He certainly did not\ncall upon his future wife. His omission to do so no doubt increased\nLizzie's urgency in the matter of her visit to Richmond. Frank\nGreystock had written to congratulate her. \"Dear Frank,\" she had said\nin reply, \"a woman situated as I am has so many things to think of.\nLord Fawn's position will be of service to my child. Mind you come\nand see me at Fawn Court. I count so much on your friendship and\nassistance.\"\n\nOf course she was expected at Richmond,--although throughout the\nmorning Lady Fawn had entertained almost a hope that she wouldn't\ncome. \"He was only lukewarm in defending her,\" Mrs. Hittaway had said\nin her letter, \"and I still think that there may be an escape.\" Not\neven a note had come from Lord Fawn himself,--nor from Lady Eustace.\nPossibly something violent might have been done, and Lady Eustace\nwould not appear. But Lady Eustace did appear,--and, after a fashion,\nwas made welcome at Fawn Court.\n\nThe Fawn ladies were not good hypocrites. Lady Fawn had said almost\nnothing to her daughters of her visit to Mount Street, but Augusta\nhad heard the discussion in Mrs. Hittaway's drawing-room as to the\ncharacter of the future bride. The coming visit had been spoken of\nalmost with awe, and there was a general conviction in the dovecote\nthat an evil thing had fallen upon them. Consequently, their\naffection to the new-comer, though spoken in words, was not made\nevident by signs and manners. Lizzie herself took care that the\nposition in which she was received should be sufficiently declared.\n\"It seems so odd that I am to come among you as a sister,\" she said.\nThe girls were forced to assent to the claim, but they assented\ncoldly. \"He has told me to attach myself especially to you,\" she\nwhispered to Augusta. The unfortunate chosen one, who had but little\nstrength of her own, accepted the position, and then, as the only\nmeans of escaping the embraces of her newly-found sister, pleaded the\nviolence of a headache. \"My mother!\" said Lizzie to Lady Fawn. \"Yes,\nmy dear,\" said Lady Fawn. \"One of the girls had perhaps better go up\nand show you your room.\" \"I am very much afraid about it,\" said Lady\nFawn to her daughter Amelia. Amelia replied only by shaking her head.\n\nOn the Tuesday morning there came a note from Lord Fawn to his\nlady-love. Of course the letter was not shown, but Lizzie received it\nat the breakfast table, and read it with many little smiles and signs\nof satisfaction. And then she gave out various little statements as\nhaving been made in that letter. He says this, and he says that, and\nhe is coming here, and going there, and he will do one thing, and\nhe won't do the other. We have often seen young ladies crowing over\ntheir lovers' letters, and it was pleasant to see Lizzie crowing over\nhers. And yet there was but very little in the letter. Lord Fawn told\nher that what with the House and what with the Office, he could not\nget down to Richmond before Saturday; but that on Saturday he would\ncome. Then he signed himself \"yours affectionately, Fawn.\" Lizzie\ndid her crowing very prettily. The outward show of it was there\nto perfection,--so that the Fawn girls really believed that their\nbrother had written an affectionate lover's letter. Inwardly, Lizzie\nswore to herself, as she read the cold words with indignation, that\nthe man should not escape her.\n\nThe days went by very tediously. On the Wednesday and the Friday Lady\nEustace made an excuse of going up to town, and insisted on taking\nthe unfortunate Augusta with her. There was no real reason for these\njourneys to London,--unless that glance which on each occasion\nwas given to the contents of the iron case was a real reason. The\ndiamonds were safe, and Miss Macnulty was enjoying herself. On the\nFriday Lizzie proposed to Augusta that they should jointly make a\nraid upon the member of Her Majesty's Government at his office; but\nAugusta positively refused to take such a step. \"I know he would\nbe angry,\" pleaded Augusta. \"Psha! who cares for his anger?\" said\nLizzie. But the visit was not made.\n\nOn the Saturday,--the Saturday which was to bring Lord Fawn down to\ndinner,--another most unexpected visitor made his appearance. At\nabout three o'clock Frank Greystock was at Fawn Court. Now it was\ncertainly understood that Mr. Greystock had been told not to come to\nFawn Court as long as Lucy Morris was there. \"Dear Mr. Greystock, I'm\nsure you will take what I say as I mean it,\" Lady Fawn had whispered\nto him. \"You know how attached we all are to our dear little Lucy.\nPerhaps you know--.\" There had been more of it; but the meaning of it\nall was undoubtedly this,--that Frank was not to pay visits to Lucy\nMorris at Fawn Court. Now he had come to see his cousin Lizzie\nEustace.\n\nOn this occasion Lady Fawn, with Amelia and two of the other girls,\nwere out in the carriage. The unfortunate Augusta had been left at\nhome with her bosom friend;--while Cecilia and Nina were supposed to\nbe talking French with Lucy Morris. They were all out in the grounds,\nsitting upon the benches, and rambling among the shrubberies, when\nof a sudden Frank Greystock was in the midst of them. Lizzie's\nexpression of joy at seeing her cousin was almost as great as though\nhe had been in fact a brother. She ran up to him and grasped his\nhand, and hung on his arm, and looked up into his face, and then\nburst into tears. But the tears were not violent tears. There were\njust three sobs, and two bright eyes full of water, and a lace\nhandkerchief,--and then a smile. \"Oh, Frank,\" she said, \"it does make\none think so of old times!\" Augusta had by this time been almost\npersuaded to believe in her,--though the belief by no means made the\npoor young woman happy. Frank thought that his cousin looked very\nwell, and said something as to Lord Fawn being \"the happiest fellow\ngoing.\" \"I hope I shall make him happy,\" said Lizzie, clasping her\nhands together.\n\nLucy meanwhile was standing in the circle with the others. It never\noccurred to her that it was her duty to run away from the man she\nloved. She had shaken hands with him, and felt something of affection\nin his pressure. She did believe that his visit was made entirely to\nhis cousin, and had no idea at the moment of disobeying Lady Fawn.\nDuring the last few days she had been thrown very much with her old\nfriend Lizzie, and had been treated by the future peeress with many\nsigns of almost sisterly affection. \"Dear Lucy,\" Lizzie had said,\n\"you can understand me. These people,--oh, they are so good, but\nthey can't understand me.\" Lucy had expressed a hope that Lord\nFawn understood her. \"Oh, Lord Fawn,--well; yes; perhaps;--I don't\nknow. It so often happens that one's husband is the last person to\nunderstand one.\"\n\n\"If I thought so, I wouldn't marry him,\" said Lucy.\n\n\"Frank Greystock will understand you,\" said Lizzie. It was indeed\ntrue that Lucy did understand something of her wealthy friend's\ncharacter, and was almost ashamed of the friendship. With Lizzie\nGreystock she had never sympathised, and Lizzie Eustace had always\nbeen distasteful to her. She already felt that the less she should\nsee of Lizzie Fawn the better she should like it.\n\nBefore an hour was over, Frank Greystock was walking round the\nshrubberies with Lucy,--and was walking with Lucy alone. It was\nundoubtedly the fact that Lady Eustace had contrived that it should\nbe so. The unfitness of the thing recommended it to her. Frank could\nhardly marry a wife without a shilling. Lucy would certainly not\nthink at all of shillings. Frank,--as Lizzie knew,--had been almost\nat her feet within the last fortnight, and might, in some possible\nemergency, be there again. In the midst of such circumstances nothing\ncould be better than that Frank and Lucy should be thrown together.\nLizzie regarded all this as romance. Poor Lady Fawn, had she known it\nall, would have called it diabolical wickedness and inhuman cruelty.\n\n\"Well, Lucy;--what do you think of it?\" Frank Greystock said to her.\n\n\"Think of what, Mr. Greystock?\"\n\n\"You know what I mean;--this marriage?\"\n\n\"How should I be able to think? I have never seen them together. I\nsuppose Lord Fawn isn't very rich. She is rich. And then she is very\nbeautiful. Don't you think her very beautiful?\"\n\n\"Sometimes exquisitely lovely.\"\n\n\"Everybody says so;--and I am sure it is the fact. Do you know;--but\nperhaps you'll think I am envious.\"\n\n\"If I thought you envious of Lizzie, I should have to think you very\nfoolish at the same time.\"\n\n\"I don't know what that means;\"--she did know well enough what it\nmeant;--\"but sometimes to me she is almost frightful to look at.\"\n\n\"In what way?\"\n\n\"Oh, I can't tell you. She looks like a beautiful animal that you are\nafraid to caress for fear it should bite you;--an animal that would\nbe beautiful if its eyes were not so restless, and its teeth so sharp\nand so white.\"\n\n\"How very odd.\"\n\n\"Why odd, Mr. Greystock?\"\n\n\"Because I feel exactly in the same way about her. I am not in\nthe least afraid that she'll bite me; and as for caressing the\nanimal,--that kind of caressing which you mean,--it seems to me to be\njust what she's made for. But, I do feel sometimes, that she is like\na cat.\"\n\n\"Something not quite so tame as a cat,\" said Lucy.\n\n\"Nevertheless she is very lovely,--and very clever. Sometimes I think\nher the most beautiful woman I ever saw in the world.\"\n\n\"Do you, indeed?\"\n\n\"She will be immensely run after as Lady Fawn. When she pleases she\ncan make her own house quite charming. I never knew a woman who could\nsay pretty things to so many people at once.\"\n\n\"You are making her out to be a paragon of perfection, Mr.\nGreystock.\"\n\n\"And when you add to all the rest that she has four thousand a year,\nyou must admit that Lord Fawn is a lucky man.\"\n\n\"I have said nothing against it.\"\n\n\"Four thousand a year is a very great consideration, Lucy.\" Lucy for\na while said nothing. She was making up her mind that she would say\nnothing;--that she would make no reply indicative of any feeling on\nher part. But she was not sufficiently strong to keep her resolution.\n\"I wonder, Mr. Greystock,\" she said, \"that you did not attempt to win\nthe great prize yourself. Cousins do marry.\"\n\nHe had thought of attempting it, and at this moment he would not lie\nto her. \"The cousinship had nothing to do with it,\" he said.\n\n\"Perhaps you did think of it.\"\n\n\"I did, Lucy. Yes, I did. Thank God, I only thought of it.\" She\ncould not refrain herself from looking up into his face and clasping\nher hands together. A woman never so dearly loves a man as when he\nconfesses that he has been on the brink of a great crime,--but has\nrefrained, and has not committed it. \"I did think of it. I am not\ntelling you that she would have taken me. I have no reason whatever\nfor thinking so.\"\n\n\"I am sure she would,\" said Lucy, who did not in the least know what\nwords she was uttering.\n\n\"It would have been simply for her money,--her money and her beauty.\nIt would not have been because I love her.\"\n\n\"Never--never ask a girl to marry you, unless you love her, Mr.\nGreystock.\"\n\n\"Then there is only one that I can ever ask,\" said he. There was\nnothing of course that she could say to this. If he did not choose\nto go further, she was not bound to understand him. But would he go\nfurther? She felt at the moment that an open declaration of his love\nto herself would make her happy for ever, even though it should be\naccompanied by an assurance that he could not marry her. If they only\nknew each other,--that it was so between them,--that, she thought,\nwould be enough for her. And as for him--if a woman could bear such a\nposition, surely he might bear it. \"Do you know who that one is?\" he\nasked.\n\n\"No,\" she said,--shaking her head.\n\n\"Lucy, is that true?\"\n\n\"What does it matter?\"\n\n\"Lucy;--look at me, Lucy,\" and he put his hand upon her arm.\n\n\"No,--no,--no!\" she said.\n\n\"I love you so well, Lucy, that I never can love another. I have\nthought of many women, but could never even think of one, as a woman\nto love, except you. I have sometimes fancied I could marry for\nmoney and position,--to help myself on in the world by means of a\nwife,--but when my mind has run away with me, to revel amidst ideas\nof feminine sweetness, you have always--always been the heroine of\nthe tale, as the mistress of the happy castle in the air.\"\n\n\"Have I?\" she asked.\n\n\"Always,--always. As regards this,\"--and he struck himself on the\nbreast,--\"no man was ever more constant. Though I don't think much of\nmyself as a man, I know a woman when I see her.\" But he did not ask\nher to be his wife;--nor did he wait at Fawn Court till Lady Fawn had\ncome back with the carriage.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nShowing What Frank Greystock Did\n\n\nFrank Greystock escaped from the dovecote before Lady Fawn had\nreturned. He had not made his visit to Richmond with any purpose of\nseeing Lucy Morris, or of saying to her when he did see her anything\nspecial,--of saying anything that should, or anything that should\nnot, have been said. He had gone there, in truth, simply because his\ncousin had asked him, and because it was almost a duty on his part to\nsee his cousin on the momentous occasion of this new engagement. But\nhe had declared to himself that old Lady Fawn was a fool, and that\nto see Lucy again would be very pleasant. \"See her;--of course I'll\nsee her,\" he had said. \"Why should I be prevented from seeing her?\"\nNow he had seen her, and as he returned by the train to London, he\nacknowledged to himself that it was no longer in his power to promote\nhis fortune by marriage. He had at last said that to Lucy which made\nit impossible for him to offer his hand to any other woman. He had\nnot, in truth, asked her to be his wife; but he had told her that he\nloved her, and could never love any other woman. He had asked for no\nanswer to this assurance, and then he had left her.\n\nIn the course of that afternoon he did question himself as to his\nconduct to this girl, and subjected himself to some of the rigours\nof a cross-examination. He was not a man who could think of a girl\nas the one human being whom he loved above all others, and yet look\nforward with equanimity to the idea of doing her an injury. He could\nunderstand that a man unable to marry should be reticent as to his\nfeelings,--supposing him to have been weak enough to have succumbed\nto a passion which could only mar his own prospects. He was frank\nenough in owning to himself that he had been thus weak. The weakness\nhad come upon himself early in life,--and was there, an established\nfact. The girl was to him unlike any other girl;--or any man. There\nwas to him a sweetness in her companionship which he could not\nanalyse. She was not beautiful. She had none of the charms of\nfashion. He had never seen her well-dressed,--according to the ideas\nof dress which he found to be prevailing in the world. She was a\nlittle thing, who, as a man's wife, could attract no attention by\nfigure, form, or outward manner,--one who had quietly submitted\nherself to the position of a governess, and who did not seem to think\nthat in doing so she obtained less than her due. But yet he knew\nher to be better than all the rest. For him, at any rate, she was\nbetter than all the rest. Her little hand was cool and sweet to him.\nSometimes when he was heated and hard at work, he would fancy how it\nwould be with him if she were by him, and would lay it on his brow.\nThere was a sparkle in her eye that had to him more of sympathy in it\nthan could be conveyed by all the other eyes in the world. There was\nan expression in her mouth when she smiled, which was more eloquent\nto him than any sound. There were a reality and a truth about her\nwhich came home to him, and made themselves known to him as firm\nrocks which could not be shaken. He had never declared to himself\nthat deceit or hypocrisy in a woman was especially abominable. As a\nrule he looked for it in women, and would say that some amount of\naffectation was necessary to a woman's character. He knew that his\ncousin Lizzie was a little liar,--that she was, as Lucy had said, a\npretty animal that would turn and bite;--and yet he liked his cousin\nLizzie. He did not want women to be perfect,--so he would say. But\nLucy Morris, in his eyes, was perfect; and when he told her that she\nwas ever the queen who reigned in those castles in the air which he\nbuilt,--as others build them, he told her no more than the truth.\n\nHe had fallen into these feelings and could not now avoid them, or be\nquit of them;--but he could have been silent respecting them. He knew\nthat in former days, down at Bobsborough, he had not been altogether\nsilent. When he had first seen her at Fawn Court he had not been\naltogether silent. But he had been warned away from Fawn Court, and\nin that very warning there was conveyed, as it were, an absolution\nfrom the effect of words hitherto spoken. Though he had called Lady\nFawn an old fool, he had known that it was so,--had, after a fashion,\nperceived her wisdom,--and had regarded himself as a man free to\ndecide, without disgrace, that he might abandon ideas of ecstatic\nlove and look out for a rich wife. Presuming himself to be reticent\nfor the future in reference to his darling Lucy, he might do as he\npleased with himself. Thus there had come a moment in which he had\ndetermined that he would ask his rich cousin to marry him. In that\nlittle project he had been interrupted, and the reader knows what\nhad come of it. Lord Fawn's success had not in the least annoyed\nhim. He had only half resolved in regard to his cousin. She was very\nbeautiful no doubt, and there was her income;--but he also knew that\nthose teeth would bite and that those claws would scratch. But Lord\nFawn's success had given a turn to his thoughts, and had made him\nthink, for a moment, that if a man loved, he should be true to his\nlove. The reader also knows what had come of that,--how at last he\nhad not been reticent. He had not asked Lucy to be his wife; but he\nhad said that which made it impossible that he should marry any other\nwoman without dishonour.\n\nAs he thought of what he had done himself, he tried to remember\nwhether Lucy had said a word expressive of affection for himself.\nShe had in truth spoken very few words, and he could remember almost\nevery one of them. \"Have I?\"--she had asked, when he told her that\nshe had ever been the princess reigning in his castles. And there had\nbeen a joy in the question which she had not attempted to conceal.\nShe had hesitated not at all. She had not told him that she loved\nhim. But there had been something sweeter than such protestation in\nthe question she had asked him. \"Is it indeed true,\" she had said,\n\"that I have been placed there where all my joy and all my glory\nlies?\" It was not in her to tell a lie to him, even by a tone. She\nhad intended to say nothing of her love, but he knew that it had all\nbeen told. \"Have I?\"--he repeated the words to himself a dozen times,\nand as he did so, he could hear her voice. Certainly there never was\na voice that brought home to the hearer so strong a sense of its own\ntruth!\n\nWhy should he not at once make up his mind to marry her? He could\ndo it. There was no doubt of that. It was possible for him to alter\nthe whole manner of his life, to give up his clubs,--to give up even\nParliament, if the need to do so was there,--and to live as a married\nman on the earnings of his profession. There was no need why he\nshould regard himself as a poor man. Two things, no doubt, were\nagainst his regarding himself as a rich man. Ever since he had\ncommenced life in London he had been more or less in debt; and then,\nunfortunately, he had acquired a seat in Parliament at a period of\nhis career in which the dangers of such a position were greater than\nthe advantages. Nevertheless he could earn an income on which he and\nhis wife, were he to marry, could live in all comfort; and as to his\ndebts, if he would set his shoulder to the work they might be paid\noff in a twelvemonth. There was nothing in the prospect which would\nfrighten Lucy, though there might be a question whether he possessed\nthe courage needed for so violent a change.\n\nHe had chambers in the Temple; he lived in rooms which he hired from\nmonth to month in one of the big hotels at the West End; and he dined\nat his club, or at the House, when he was not dining with a friend.\nIt was an expensive and a luxurious mode of life,--and one from\nthe effects of which a man is prone to drift very quickly into\nselfishness. He was by no means given to drinking,--but he was\nalready learning to like good wine. Small economies in reference to\ncab-hire, gloves, umbrellas, and railway fares were unknown to him.\nSixpences and shillings were things with which, in his mind, it was\ngrievous to have to burden the thoughts. The Greystocks had all lived\nafter that fashion. Even the dean himself was not free from the\ncharge of extravagance. All this Frank knew, and he did not hesitate\nto tell himself, that he must make a great change if he meant to\nmarry Lucy Morris. And he was wise enough to know that the change\nwould become more difficult every day that it was postponed. Hitherto\nthe question had been an open question with him. Could it now be an\nopen question any longer? As a man of honour, was he not bound to\nshare his lot with Lucy Morris?\n\nThat evening,--that Saturday evening,--it so happened that he met\nJohn Eustace at a club to which they both belonged, and they dined\ntogether. They had long known each other, and had been thrown into\ncloser intimacy by the marriage between Sir Florian and Lizzie. John\nEustace had never been fond of Lizzie, and now, in truth, liked\nher less than ever; but he did like Lizzie's cousin, and felt that\npossibly Frank might be of use to him in the growing difficulty of\nmanaging the heir's property and looking after the heir's interests.\n\"You've let the widow slip through your fingers,\" he said to Frank,\nas they sat together at the table.\n\n\"I told you Lord Fawn was to be the lucky man,\" said Frank.\n\n\"I know you did. I hadn't seen it. I can only say I wish it had been\nthe other way.\"\n\n\"Why so? Fawn isn't a bad fellow.\"\n\n\"No;--not exactly a bad fellow. He isn't, you know, what I call a\ngood fellow. In the first place, he is marrying her altogether for\nher money.\"\n\n\"Which is just what you advised me to do.\"\n\n\"I thought you really liked her. And then Fawn will be always afraid\nof her,--and won't be in the least afraid of us. We shall have to\nfight him, and he won't fight her. He's a cantankerous fellow,--is\nFawn,--when he's not afraid of his adversary.\"\n\n\"But why should there be any fighting?\"\n\nEustace paused a minute, and rubbed his face and considered the\nmatter before he answered. \"She is troublesome, you know,\" he said.\n\n\"What; Lizzie?\"\n\n\"Yes;--and I begin to be afraid she'll give us as much as we know how\nto do. I was with Camperdown to-day. I'm blessed if she hasn't begun\nto cut down a whole side of a forest at Portray. She has no more\nright to touch the timber, except for repairs about the place, than\nyou have.\"\n\n\"And if she lives for fifty years,\" asked Greystock, \"is none to be\ncut?\"\n\n\"Yes;--by consent. Of course the regular cutting for the year is\ndone, year by year. That's as regular as the rents, and the produce\nis sold by the acre. But she is marking the old oaks. What the deuce\ncan she want money for?\"\n\n\"Fawn will put all that right.\"\n\n\"He'll have to do it,\" said Eustace. \"Since she has been down with\nthe old Lady Fawn, she has written a note to Camperdown,--after\nleaving all his letters unanswered for the last twelvemonth,--to tell\nhim that Lord Fawn is to have nothing to do with her property, and\nthat certain people, called Mowbray and Mopus, are her lawyers.\nCamperdown is in an awful way about it.\"\n\n\"Lord Fawn will put it all right,\" said Frank.\n\n\"Camperdown is afraid that he won't. They've met twice since the\nengagement was made, and Camperdown says that, at the last meeting,\nFawn gave himself airs, or was, at any rate, unpleasant. There were\nwords about those diamonds.\"\n\n\"You don't mean to say that Lord Fawn wants to keep your brother's\nfamily jewels?\"\n\n\"Camperdown didn't say that exactly;--but Fawn made no offer of\ngiving them up. I wasn't there, and only heard what Camperdown told\nme. Camperdown thinks he's afraid of her.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't wonder at that in the least,\" said Frank.\n\n\"I know there'll be trouble,\" continued Eustace, \"and Fawn won't\nbe able to help us through it. She's a strong-willed, cunning,\nobstinate, clever little creature. Camperdown swears he'll be too\nmany for her, but I almost doubt it.\"\n\n\"And therefore you wish I were going to marry her?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do. You might manage her. The money comes from the Eustace\nproperty, and I'd sooner it should go to you than a half-hearted,\nnumb-fingered, cold-blooded Whig, like Fawn.\"\n\n\"I don't like cunning women,\" said Frank.\n\n\"As bargains go, it wouldn't be a bad one,\" said Eustace. \"She's very\nyoung, has a noble jointure, and is as handsome as she can stand.\nIt's too good a thing for Fawn;--too good for any Whig.\"\n\nWhen Eustace left him, Greystock lit his cigar and walked with it\nin his mouth from Pall Mall to the Temple. He often worked there at\nnight when he was not bound to be in the House, or when the House\nwas not sitting,--and he was now intent on mastering the mysteries\nof some much-complicated legal case which had been confided to him,\nin order that he might present it to a jury enveloped in increased\nmystery. But, as he went, he thought rather of matrimony than of\nlaw;--and he thought especially of matrimony as it was about to\naffect Lord Fawn. Could a man be justified in marrying for money, or\nhave rational ground for expecting that he might make himself happy\nby doing so? He kept muttering to himself as he went, the Quaker's\nadvice to the old farmer, \"Doan't thou marry for munny, but goa where\nmunny is!\" But he muttered it as condemning the advice rather than\naccepting it.\n\nHe could look out and see two altogether different kinds of life\nbefore him, both of which had their allurements. There was the\nBelgravia-cum-Pimlico life, the scene of which might extend itself\nto South Kensington, enveloping the parks and coming round over\nPark Lane, and through Grosvenor Square and Berkeley Square back\nto Piccadilly. Within this he might live with lords and countesses\nand rich folk generally, going out to the very best dinner-parties,\navoiding stupid people, having everything the world could give,\nexcept a wife and family and home of his own. All this he could\nachieve by the work which would certainly fall in his way, and by\nmeans of that position in the world which he had already attained by\nhis wits. And the wife, with the family and house of his own, might\nbe forthcoming, should it ever come in his way to form an attachment\nwith a wealthy woman. He knew how dangerous were the charms of such a\nlife as this to a man growing old among the flesh-pots, without any\none to depend upon him. He had seen what becomes of the man who is\nalways dining out at sixty. But he might avoid that. \"Doan't thou\nmarry for munny, but goa where munny is.\" And then there was that\nother outlook, the scene of which was laid somewhere north of Oxford\nStreet, and the glory of which consisted in Lucy's smile, and Lucy's\nhand, and Lucy's kiss, as he returned home weary from his work.\n\nThere are many men, and some women, who pass their lives without\nknowing what it is to be or to have been in love. They not improbably\nmarry,--the men do, at least,--and make good average husbands. Their\nwives are useful to them, and they learn to feel that a woman, being\na wife, is entitled to all the respect, protection, and honour which\na man can give, or procure for her. Such men, no doubt, often live\nhonest lives, are good Christians, and depart hence with hopes as\njustifiable as though they had loved as well as Romeo. But yet, as\nmen, they have lacked a something, the want of which has made them\nsmall and poor and dry. It has never been felt by such a one that\nthere would be triumph in giving away everything belonging to him\nfor one little whispered, yielding word, in which there should be\nacknowledgment that he had succeeded in making himself master of a\nhuman heart. And there are other men,--very many men,--who have felt\nthis love, and have resisted it, feeling it to be unfit that Love\nshould be Lord of all. Frank Greystock had told himself, a score\nof times, that it would be unbecoming in him to allow a passion to\nobtain such mastery of him as to interfere with his ambition. Could\nit be right that he who, as a young man, had already done so much,\nwho might possibly have before him so high and great a career, should\nmiss that, because he could not resist a feeling which a little chit\nof a girl had created in his bosom,--a girl without money, without\nposition, without even beauty; a girl as to whom, were he to marry\nher, the world would say, \"Oh, heaven!--there has Frank Greystock\ngone and married a little governess out of old Lady Fawn's nursery!\"\nAnd yet he loved her with all his heart, and to-day he had told her\nof his love. What should he do next?\n\nThe complicated legal case received neither much ravelling nor\nunravelling from his brains that night; but before he left his\nchambers he wrote the following letter:--\n\n\n   Midnight, Saturday,\n   All among my books and papers,\n   2, Bolt Court, Middle Temple.\n\n   DEAR, DEAR LUCY,\n\n   I told you to-day that you had ever been the Queen who\n   reigned in those palaces which I have built in Spain.\n   You did not make me much of an answer; but such as it\n   was,--only just one muttered doubtful-sounding word,--it\n   has made me hope that I may be justified in asking you to\n   share with me a home which will not be palatial. If I am\n   wrong--? But no;--I will not think I am wrong, or that I\n   can be wrong. No sound coming from you is really doubtful.\n   You are truth itself, and the muttered word would have\n   been other than it was, if you had not--! may I say,--had\n   you not already learned to love me?\n\n   You will feel, perhaps, that I ought to have said all this\n   to you then, and that a letter in such a matter is but\n   a poor substitute for a spoken assurance of affection.\n   You shall have the whole truth. Though I have long loved\n   you, I did not go down to Fawn Court with the purpose of\n   declaring to you my love. What I said to you was God's\n   truth; but it was spoken without thought at the moment. I\n   have thought of it much since;--and now I write to ask you\n   to be my wife. I have lived for the last year or two with\n   this hope before me; and now-- Dear, dear Lucy, I will not\n   write in too great confidence; but I will tell you that\n   all my happiness is in your hands.\n\n   If your answer is what I hope it may be, tell Lady Fawn at\n   once. I shall immediately write to Bobsborough, as I hate\n   secrets in such matters. And if it is to be so,--then I\n   shall claim the privilege of going to Fawn Court as soon\n   and as often as I please.\n\n   Yours ever and always,--if you will have me,--\n\n   F. G.\n\n\nHe sat for an hour at his desk, with his letter lying on the table,\nbefore he left his chambers,--looking at it. If he should decide on\nposting it, then would that life in Belgravia-cum-Pimlico,--of which\nin truth he was very fond,--be almost closed for him. The lords and\ncountesses, and rich county members, and leading politicians, who\nwere delighted to welcome him, would not care for his wife; nor\ncould he very well take his wife among them. To live with them as\na married man, he must live as they lived;--and must have his own\nhouse in their precincts. Later in life, he might possibly work up to\nthis;--but for the present he must retire into dim domestic security\nand the neighbourhood of Regent's Park. He sat looking at the letter,\ntelling himself that he was now, at this moment, deciding his own\nfate in life. And he again muttered the Quaker's advice, \"Doan't thou\nmarry for munny, but goa where munny is!\" It may be said, however,\nthat no man ever writes such a letter, and then omits to send it. He\nwalked out of the Temple with it in his hand, and dropped it into\na pillar letter-box just outside the gate. As the envelope slipped\nthrough his fingers, he felt that he had now bound himself to his\nfate.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n\"Doan't Thou Marry for Munny\"\n\n\nAs that Saturday afternoon wore itself away, there was much\nexcitement at Fawn Court. When Lady Fawn returned with the carriage,\nshe heard that Frank Greystock had been at Fawn Court; and she heard\nalso, from Augusta, that he had been rambling about the grounds alone\nwith Lucy Morris. At any exhibition of old ladies, held before a\ncompetent jury, Lady Fawn would have taken a prize on the score of\ngood humour. No mother of daughters was ever less addicted to scold\nand to be fretful. But just now she was a little unhappy. Lizzie's\nvisit had not been a success, and she looked forward to her son's\nmarriage with almost unmixed dismay. Mrs. Hittaway had written daily,\nand in all Mrs. Hittaway's letters some addition was made to the evil\nthings already known. In her last letter Mrs. Hittaway had expressed\nher opinion that even yet \"Frederic\" would escape. All this Lady Fawn\nhad, of course, not told to her daughters generally. To the eldest,\nAugusta, it was thought expedient to say nothing, because Augusta had\nbeen selected as the companion of the, alas! too probable future Lady\nFawn. But to Amelia something did leak out, and it became apparent\nthat the household was uneasy. Now,--as an evil added to this,--Frank\nGreystock had been there in Lady Fawn's absence, walking about the\ngrounds alone with Lucy Morris. Lady Fawn could hardly restrain\nherself. \"How could Lucy be so very wrong?\" she said, in the hearing\nboth of Augusta and Amelia.\n\nLizzie Eustace did not hear this; but knowing very well that a\ngoverness should not receive a lover in the absence of the lady of\nthe house, she made her little speech about it. \"Dear Lady Fawn,\" she\nsaid, \"my cousin Frank came to see me while you were out.\"\n\n\"So I hear,\" said Lady Fawn.\n\n\"Frank and I are more like brother and sister than anything else. I\nhad so much to say to him;--so much to ask him to do! I have no one\nelse, you know, and I had especially told him to come here.\"\n\n\"Of course he was welcome to come.\"\n\n\"Only I was afraid you might think that there was some little lover's\ntrick,--on dear Lucy's part, you know.\"\n\n\"I never suspect anything of that kind,\" said Lady Fawn, bridling up.\n\"Lucy Morris is above any sort of trick. We don't have any tricks\nhere, Lady Eustace.\" Lady Fawn herself might say that Lucy was\n\"wrong,\" but no one else in that house should even suggest evil of\nLucy. Lizzie retreated smiling. To have \"put Lady Fawn's back up,\" as\nshe called it, was to her an achievement and a pleasure.\n\nBut the great excitement of the evening consisted in the expected\ncoming of Lord Fawn. Of what nature would be the meeting between\nLord Fawn and his promised bride? Was there anything of truth in the\nopinion expressed by Mrs. Hittaway that her brother was beginning\nto become tired of his bargain? That Lady Fawn was tired of it\nherself,--that she disliked Lizzie, and was afraid of her, and averse\nto the idea of regarding her as a daughter-in-law,--she did not now\nattempt to hide from herself. But there was the engagement, known\nto all the world, and how could its fulfilment now be avoided? The\npoor dear old woman began to repeat to herself the first half of the\nQuaker's advice, \"Doan't thou marry for munny.\"\n\nLord Fawn was to come down only in time for a late dinner. An ardent\nlover, one would have thought, might have left his work somewhat\nearlier on a Saturday, so as to have enjoyed with his sweetheart\nsomething of the sweetness of the Saturday summer afternoon;--but it\nwas seven before he reached Fawn Court, and the ladies were at that\ntime in their rooms dressing. Lizzie had affected to understand all\nhis reasons for being so late, and had expressed herself as perfectly\nsatisfied. \"He has more to do than any of the others,\" she had said\nto Augusta. \"Indeed, the whole of our vast Indian empire may be said\nto hang upon him, just at present;\"--which was not complimentary to\nLord Fawn's chief, the Right Honourable Legge Wilson, who at the\npresent time represented the interests of India in the Cabinet. \"He\nis terribly overworked, and it is a shame;--but what can one do?\"\n\n\"I think he likes work,\" Augusta had replied.\n\n\"But I don't like it,--not so much of it; and so I shall make him\nunderstand, my dear. But I don't complain. As long as he tells me\neverything, I will never really complain.\" Perhaps it might some\nday be as she desired; perhaps as a husband he would be thoroughly\nconfidential and communicative; perhaps when they two were one flesh\nhe would tell her everything about India;--but as yet he certainly\nhad not told her much.\n\n\"How had they better meet?\" Amelia asked her mother.\n\n\"Oh;--I don't know;--anyhow; just as they like. We can't arrange\nanything for her. If she had chosen to dress herself early, she might\nhave seen him as he came in; but it was impossible to tell her so.\"\nNo arrangement was therefore made, and as all the other ladies were\nin the drawing-room before Lizzie came down, she had to give him his\nwelcome in the midst of the family circle. She did it very well.\nPerhaps she had thought of it, and made her arrangements. When he\ncame forward to greet her, she put her cheek up, just a little, so\nthat he might see that he was expected to kiss it;--but so little,\nthat should he omit to do so, there might be no visible awkwardness.\nIt must be acknowledged on Lizzie's behalf, that she could always\navoid awkwardness. He did touch her cheek with his lips, blushing as\nhe did so. She had her ungloved hand in his, and, still holding him,\nreturned into the circle. She said not a word; and what he said was\nof no moment;--but they had met as lovers, and any of the family who\nhad allowed themselves to imagine that even yet the match might be\nbroken, now unconsciously abandoned that hope. \"Was he always such a\ntruant, Lady Fawn?\"--Lizzie asked, when it seemed to her that no one\nelse would speak a word.\n\n\"I don't know that there is much difference,\" said Lady Fawn. \"Here\nis dinner. Frederic, will you give--Lady Eustace your arm?\" Poor Lady\nFawn! It often came to pass that she was awkward.\n\nThere were no less than ten females sitting round the board, at the\nbottom of which Lord Fawn took his place. Lady Fawn had especially\nasked Lucy to come in to dinner, and with Lucy had come the two\nyounger girls. At Lord Fawn's right hand sat Lizzie, and Augusta at\nhis left. Lady Fawn had Amelia on one side and Lucy on the other. \"So\nMr. Greystock was here to-day,\" Lady Fawn whispered into Lucy's ear.\n\n\"Yes; he was here.\"\n\n\"Oh, Lucy!\"\n\n\"I did not bid him come, Lady Fawn.\"\n\n\"I am sure of that, my dear;--but--but--\" Then there was no more to\nbe said on that subject on that occasion.\n\nDuring the whole of the dinner the conversation was kept up at the\nother end of the table by Lizzie talking to Augusta across her lover.\nThis was done in such a manner as to seem to include Lord Fawn in\nevery topic discussed. Parliament, India, the Sawab, Ireland, the\nspecial privileges of the House of Lords, the ease of a bachelor\nlife, and the delight of having at his elbow just such a rural\nretreat as Fawn Court,--these were the fruitful themes of Lizzie's\neloquence. Augusta did her part at any rate with patience; and as for\nLizzie herself, she worked with that superhuman energy which women\ncan so often display in making conversation under unfavourable\ncircumstances. The circumstances were unfavourable, for Lord Fawn\nhimself would hardly open his mouth; but Lizzie persevered, and the\nhour of dinner passed over without any show of ill-humour, or of\nsullen silence. When the hour was over, Lord Fawn left the room with\nthe ladies, and was soon closeted with his mother, while the girls\nstrolled out upon the lawn. Would Lizzie play croquet? No; Lizzie\nwould not play croquet. She thought it probable that she might catch\nher lover and force him to walk with her through the shrubberies; but\nLord Fawn was not seen upon the lawn that evening, and Lizzie was\nforced to content herself with Augusta as a companion. In the course\nof the evening, however, her lover did say a word to her in private.\n\"Give me ten minutes to-morrow between breakfast and church, Lizzie.\"\nLizzie promised that she would do so, smiling sweetly. Then there was\na little music, and then Lord Fawn retired to his studies.\n\n\"What is he going to say to me?\" Lizzie asked Augusta the next\nmorning. There existed in her bosom a sort of craving after\nconfidential friendship,--but with it there existed something that\nwas altogether incompatible with confidence. She thoroughly despised\nAugusta Fawn, and yet would have been willing,--in want of a better\nfriend,--to press Augusta to her bosom, and swear that there should\never be between them the tenderest friendship. She desired to be\nthe possessor of the outward shows of all those things of which the\ninward facts are valued by the good and steadfast ones of the earth.\nShe knew what were the aspirations,--what the ambition, of an honest\nwoman; and she knew, too, how rich were the probable rewards of\nsuch honesty. True love, true friendship, true benevolence, true\ntenderness, were beautiful to her,--qualities on which she could\ndescant almost with eloquence; and therefore she was always shamming\nlove and friendship and benevolence and tenderness. She could tell\nyou, with words most appropriate to the subject, how horrible were\nall shams, and in saying so would be not altogether insincere;--yet\nshe knew that she herself was ever shamming, and she satisfied\nherself with shams. \"What is he going to say to me?\" she asked\nAugusta, with her hands clasped, when she went up to put her bonnet\non after breakfast.\n\n\"To fix the day, I suppose,\" said Augusta.\n\n\"If I thought so, I would endeavour to please him. But it isn't that.\nI know his manner so well! I am sure it is not that. Perhaps it is\nsomething about my boy. He will not wish to separate a mother from\nher child.\"\n\n\"Oh dear, no,\" said Augusta. \"I am sure Frederic will not want to do\nthat.\"\n\n\"In anything else I will obey him,\" said Lizzie, again clasping her\nhands. \"But I must not keep him waiting,--must I? I fear my future\nlord is somewhat impatient.\" Now, if among Lord Fawn's merits one\nmerit was more conspicuous than another, it was that of patience.\nWhen Lizzie descended he was waiting for her in the hall without a\nthought that he was being kept too long. \"Now, Frederic! I should\nhave been with you two whole minutes since, if I had not had just a\nword to say to Augusta. I do so love Augusta.\"\n\n\"She is a very good girl,\" said Lord Fawn.\n\n\"So true and genuine,--and so full of spirit. I will come on the\nother side because of my parasol and the sun. There, that will do. We\nhave an hour nearly before going to church;--haven't we? I suppose\nyou will go to church.\"\n\n\"I intend it,\" said Lord Fawn.\n\n\"It is so nice to go to church,\" said Lizzie. Since her widowhood had\ncommenced, she had compromised matters with the world. One Sunday\nshe would go to church, and the next she would have a headache and\na French novel and stay in bed. But she was prepared for stricter\nconduct during at least the first months of her newly-married life.\n\n\"My dear Lizzie,\" began Lord Fawn, \"since I last saw you I have been\ntwice with Mr. Camperdown.\"\n\n\"You are not going to talk about Mr. Camperdown to-day?\"\n\n\"Well;--yes. I could not do so last night, and I shall be back in\nLondon either to-night or before you are up to-morrow morning.\"\n\n\"I hate the very name of Mr. Camperdown,\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"I am sorry for that, because I am sure you could not find an\nhonester lawyer to manage your affairs for you. He does everything\nfor me, and so he did for Sir Florian Eustace.\"\n\n\"That is just the reason why I employ some one else,\" she answered.\n\n\"Very well. I am not going to say a word about that. I may regret it,\nbut I am, just at present, the last person in the world to urge you\nupon that subject. What I want to say is this. You must restore those\ndiamonds.\"\n\n\"To whom shall I restore them?\"\n\n\"To Mr. Garnett, the silversmith, if you please,--or to Mr.\nCamperdown;--or, if you like it better, to your brother-in-law, Mr.\nJohn Eustace.\"\n\n\"And why am I to give up my own property?\"\n\nLord Fawn paused for some seconds before he replied. \"To satisfy\nmy honour,\" he then said. As she made him no immediate answer, he\ncontinued,--\"It would not suit my views that my wife should be seen\nwearing the jewels of the Eustace family.\"\n\n\"I don't want to wear them,\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"Then why should you desire to keep them?\"\n\n\"Because they are my own. Because I do not choose to be put upon.\nBecause I will not allow such a cunning old snake as Mr. Camperdown\nto rob me of my property. They are my own, and you should defend my\nright to them.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say that you will not oblige me by doing what I ask\nyou?\"\n\n\"I will not be robbed of what is my own,\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"Then I must declare--\" and now Lord Fawn spoke very slowly--\"then\nI must declare that under these circumstances, let the consequences\nbe what they may, I must retreat from the enviable position which\nyour favour has given me.\" The words were cold and solemn, and were\nill-spoken; but they were deliberate, and had been indeed actually\nlearned by heart.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" said Lizzie, flashing round upon him.\n\n\"I mean what I say,--exactly. But perhaps it may be well that I\nshould explain my motives more clearly.\"\n\n\"I don't know anything about motives, and I don't care anything about\nmotives. Do you mean to tell me that you have come here to threaten\nme with deserting me?\"\n\n\"You had better hear me.\"\n\n\"I don't choose to hear a word more after what you have said,--unless\nit be in the way of an apology, or retracting your most injurious\naccusation.\"\n\n\"I have said nothing to retract,\" said Lord Fawn solemnly.\n\n\"Then I will not hear another word from you. I have friends, and you\nshall see them.\"\n\nLord Fawn, who had thought a great deal upon the subject, and had\nwell understood that this interview would be for him one of great\ndifficulty, was very anxious to induce her to listen to a few further\nwords of explanation. \"Dear Lizzie--\" he began.\n\n\"I will not be addressed, sir, in that way by a man who is treating\nme as you are doing,\" she said.\n\n\"But I want you to understand me.\"\n\n\"Understand you! You understand nothing yourself that a man ought to\nunderstand. I wonder that you have the courage to be so insolent. If\nyou knew what you were doing, you would not have the spirit to do\nit.\"\n\nHer words did not quite come home to him, and much of her scorn was\nlost upon him. He was now chiefly anxious to explain to her that\nthough he must abide by the threat he had made, he was quite willing\nto go on with his engagement if she would oblige him in the matter of\nthe diamonds. \"It was necessary that I should explain to you that I\ncould not allow that necklace to be brought into my house.\"\n\n\"No one thought of taking it to your house.\"\n\n\"What were you to do with it, then?\"\n\n\"Keep it in my own,\" said Lizzie stoutly. They were still walking\ntogether, and were now altogether out of sight of the house. Lizzie\nin her excitement had forgotten church, had forgotten the Fawn\nwomen,--had forgotten everything except the battle which it was\nnecessary that she should fight for herself. She did not mean to\nallow the marriage to be broken off,--but she meant to retain\nthe necklace. The manner in which Lord Fawn had demanded its\nrestitution,--in which there had been none of that mock tenderness by\nwhich she might have permitted herself to be persuaded,--had made\nher, at any rate for the moment, as firm as steel on this point. It\nwas inconceivable to her that he should think himself at liberty to\ngo back from his promise, because she would not render up property\nwhich was in her possession, and which no one could prove not to be\nlegally her own! She walked on full of fierce courage,--despising\nhim, but determined that she would marry him.\n\n\"I am afraid we do not understand each other,\" he said at last.\n\n\"Certainly I do not understand you, sir.\"\n\n\"Will you allow my mother to speak to you on the subject?\"\n\n\"No. If I told your mother to give up her diamonds, what would she\nsay?\"\n\n\"But they are not yours, Lady Eustace, unless you will submit that\nquestion to an arbitrator.\"\n\n\"I will submit nothing to anybody. You have no right to speak on such\na subject till after we are married.\"\n\n\"I must have it settled first, Lady Eustace.\"\n\n\"Then, Lord Fawn, you won't have it settled first. Or rather it is\nsettled already. I shall keep my own necklace, and Mr. Camperdown may\ndo anything he pleases. As for you,--if you ill-treat me, I shall\nknow where to go to.\" They had now come out from the shrubbery upon\nthe lawn, and there was the carriage at the door, ready to take the\nelders of the family to church. Of course in such a condition of\naffairs it would be understood that Lizzie was one of the elders. \"I\nshall not go to church now,\" she said, as she advanced across the\nlawn towards the hall door. \"You will be pleased, Lord Fawn, to let\nyour mother know that I am detained. I do not suppose that you will\ndare to tell her why.\" Then she sailed round at the back of the\ncarriage and entered the hall, in which several of the girls were\nstanding. Among them was Augusta, waiting to take her seat among the\nelders;--but Lizzie passed on through them all, without a word, and\nmarched up to her bed-room.\n\n\"Oh, Frederic, what is the matter?\" asked Augusta, as soon as her\nbrother entered the house.\n\n\"Never mind. Nothing is the matter. You had better go to church.\nWhere is my mother?\"\n\nAt this moment Lady Fawn appeared at the bottom of the stairs, having\npassed Lizzie as she was coming down. Not a syllable had then been\nspoken, but Lady Fawn at once knew that much was wrong. Her son went\nup to her and whispered a word in her ear. \"Oh, certainly,\" she said,\ndesisting from the operation of pulling on her gloves. \"Augusta,\nneither your brother nor I will go to church.\"\n\n\"Nor--Lady Eustace?\"\n\n\"It seems not,\" said Lady Fawn.\n\n\"Lady Eustace will not go to church,\" said Lord Fawn.\n\n\"And where is Lucy?\" asked Lydia.\n\n\"She will not go to church either,\" said Lady Fawn. \"I have just been\nwith her.\"\n\n\"Nobody is going to church,\" said Nina. \"All the same, I shall go by\nmyself.\"\n\n\"Augusta, my dear, you and the girls had better go. You can take the\ncarriage of course.\" But Augusta and the girls chose to walk, and the\ncarriage was sent round into the yard.\n\n\"There's a rumpus already between my lord and the young missus,\" said\nthe coachman to the groom;--for the coachman had seen the way in\nwhich Lady Eustace had returned to the house. And there certainly was\na rumpus. During the whole morning Lord Fawn was closeted with his\nmother, and then he went away to London without saying a word to any\none of the family. But he left this note for Lady Eustace:--\n\n\n   DEAREST LIZZIE,\n\n   Think well of what I have said to you. It is not that I\n   desire to break off our engagement; but that I cannot\n   allow my wife to keep the diamonds which belong of right\n   to her late husband's family. You may be sure that I\n   should not be thus urgent had I not taken steps to\n   ascertain that I am right in my judgment. In the meantime\n   you had better consult my mother.\n\n   Yours affectionately,\n\n   FAWN.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n\"I'll Give You a Hundred Guinea Brooch\"\n\n\nThere had been another \"affair\" in the house that morning, though of\na nature very different to the \"rumpus\" which had occurred between\nLord Fawn and Lady Eustace. Lady Fawn had been closeted with Lucy,\nand had expressed her opinion of the impropriety of Frank Greystock's\nvisit. \"I suppose he came to see his cousin,\" said Lady Fawn, anxious\nto begin with some apology for such conduct.\n\n\"I cannot tell,\" said Lucy. \"Perhaps he did. I think he said so.\nI think he cared more to see me.\" Then Lady Fawn was obliged to\nexpress her opinion, and she did so, uttering many words of wisdom.\nFrank Greystock, had he intended to sacrifice his prospects by a\ndisinterested marriage, would have spoken out before now. He was old\nenough to have made up his mind on such a subject, and he had not\nspoken out. He did not mean marriage. That was quite evident to Lady\nFawn;--and her dear Lucy was revelling in hopes which would make her\nmiserable. If Lucy could only have known of the letter, which was\nalready her own property though lying in the pillar letter-box in\nFleet Street, and which had not already been sent down and delivered\nsimply because it was Sunday morning! But she was very brave. \"He\ndoes love me,\" she said. \"He told me so.\"\n\n\"Oh, Lucy;--that is worse and worse. A man to tell you that he loves\nyou, and yet not ask you to be his wife!\"\n\n\"I am contented,\" said Lucy. That assertion, however, could hardly\nhave been true.\n\n\"Contented! And did you tell him that you returned his love?\"\n\n\"He knew it without my telling him,\" said Lucy. It was so hard upon\nher that she should be so interrogated while that letter was lying in\nthe iron box!\n\n\"Dear Lucy, this must not be,\" said Lady Fawn. \"You are preparing for\nyourself inexpressible misery.\"\n\n\"I have done nothing wrong, Lady Fawn.\"\n\n\"No, my dear;--no. I do not say you have been wrong. But I think he\nis wrong,--so wrong! I call it wicked. I do indeed. For your own sake\nyou should endeavour to forget him.\"\n\n\"I will never forget him!\" said Lucy. \"To think of him is everything\nto me. He told me I was his Queen, and he shall be my King. I will\nbe loyal to him always.\" To poor Lady Fawn this was very dreadful.\nThe girl persisted in declaring her love for the man, and yet did\nnot even pretend to think that the man meant to marry her! And this,\ntoo, was Lucy Morris,--of whom Lady Fawn was accustomed to say to her\nintimate friends that she had altogether ceased to look upon her as a\ngoverness. \"Just one of ourselves, Mrs. Winslow,--and almost as dear\nas one of my own girls!\" Thus, in the warmth of her heart, she had\ndescribed Lucy to a neighbour within the last week. Many more words\nof wisdom she spoke, and then she left poor Lucy in no mood for\nchurch. Would she have been in a better mood for the morning service\nhad she known of the letter in the iron post?\n\nThen Lady Fawn had put on her bonnet and gone down into the hall, and\nthe \"rumpus\" had come. After that, everybody in the house knew that\nall things were astray. When the girls came home from church, their\nbrother was gone. Half an hour before dinner Lady Fawn sent the\nnote up to Lizzie, with a message to say that they would dine at\nthree,--it being Sunday. Lizzie sent down word that as she was\nunwell, she would ask to have just a cup of tea and \"something\" sent\nto her own room. If Lady Fawn would allow her, she would remain\nup-stairs with her child. She always made use of her child when\ntroubles came.\n\nThe afternoon was very sad and dreary. Lady Fawn had an interview\nwith Lady Eustace, but Lizzie altogether refused to listen to any\nadvice on the subject of the necklace. \"It is an affair,\" she said\nhaughtily, \"in which I must judge for myself,--or with the advice\nof my own particular friends. Had Lord Fawn waited until we were\nmarried; then indeed--!\"\n\n\"But that would have been too late,\" said Lady Fawn severely.\n\n\"He is, at any rate, premature now in laying his commands upon\nme,\" said Lizzie. Lady Fawn, who was perhaps more anxious that\nthe marriage should be broken off than that the jewels should be\nrestored, then withdrew; and as she left the room Lizzie clasped her\nboy to her bosom. \"He, at any rate, is left to me,\" she said. Lucy\nand the Fawn girls went to evening church, and afterwards Lizzie came\ndown among them when they were at tea. Before she went to bed Lizzie\ndeclared her intention of returning to her own house in Mount Street\non the following day. To this Lady Fawn of course made no objection.\n\nOn the next morning there came an event which robbed Lizzie's\ndeparture of some of the importance which might otherwise have\nbeen attached to it. The post-office, with that accuracy in the\nperformance of its duties for which it is conspicuous among all\noffices, caused Lucy's letter to be delivered to her while the\nmembers of the family were sitting round the breakfast table.\nLizzie, indeed, was not there. She had expressed her intention of\nbreakfasting in her own room, and had requested that a conveyance\nmight be ready to take her to the 11.30 train. Augusta had been with\nher, asking whether anything could be done for her. \"I care for\nnothing now, except my child,\" Lizzie had replied. As the nurse and\nthe lady's maid were both in the room, Augusta, of course, could say\nnothing further. That occurred after prayers, and while the tea was\nbeing made. When Augusta reached the breakfast-room, Lucy was cutting\nup the loaf of bread, and at the same moment the old butler was\nplacing a letter immediately under her eyes. She saw the handwriting\nand recognised it, but yet she finished cutting the bread. \"Lucy, do\ngive me that hunchy bit,\" said Nina.\n\n\"Hunchy is not in the dictionary,\" said Cecilia.\n\n\"I want it in my plate, and not in the dictionary,\" said Nina.\n\nLucy did as she was asked, but her hand trembled as she gave the\nhunch, and Lady Fawn saw that her face was crimson. She took the\nletter and broke the envelope, and as she drew out the sheet of\npaper, she looked up at Lady Fawn. The fate of her whole life was in\nher hands, and there she was standing with all their eyes fixed upon\nher. She did not even know how to sit down, but, still standing, she\nread the first words, and at the last, \"Dear, dear Lucy,\"--\"Yours\never and always, if you will have me, F. G.\" She did not want to read\nany more of it then. She sat down slowly, put the precious paper back\ninto its envelope, looked round upon them all, and knew that she was\ncrimson to the roots of her hair, blushing like a guilty thing.\n\n\"Lucy, my dear,\" said Lady Fawn,--and Lucy at once turned her face\nfull upon her old friend,--\"you have got a letter that agitates you.\"\n\n\"Yes,--I have,\" she said.\n\n\"Go into the book-room. You can come back to breakfast when you have\nread it, you know.\" Thereupon Lucy rose from her seat, and retired\nwith her treasure into the book-room. But even when she was there she\ncould not at once read her letter. When the door was closed and she\nknew that she was alone she looked at it, and then clasped it tight\nbetween her hands. She was almost afraid to read it lest the letter\nitself should contradict the promise which the last words of it had\nseemed to convey to her. She went up to the window and stood there\ngazing out upon the gravel road, with her hand containing the letter\npressed upon her heart. Lady Fawn had told her that she was preparing\nfor herself inexpressible misery;--and now there had come to her joy\nso absolutely inexpressible! \"A man to tell you that he loves you,\nand yet not ask you to be his wife!\" She repeated to herself Lady\nFawn's words,--and then those other words, \"Yours ever and always, if\nyou will have me!\" Have him, indeed! She threw from her, at once, as\nvain and wicked and false, all idea of coying her love. She would\nleap at his neck if he were there, and tell him that for years he had\nbeen almost her god. And of course he knew it. \"If I will have him!\nTraitor!\" she said to herself, smiling through her tears. Then she\nreflected that after all it would be well that she should read the\nletter. There might be conditions;--though what conditions could he\npropose with which she would not comply? However, she seated herself\nin a corner of the room and did read the letter. As she read it, she\nhardly understood it all;--but she understood what she wanted to\nunderstand. He asked her to share with him his home. He had spoken\nto her that day without forethought;--but mustn't such speech be\nthe truest and the sweetest of all speeches? \"And now I write to\nyou to ask you to be my wife.\" Oh, how wrong some people can be in\ntheir judgments! How wrong Lady Fawn had been in hers about Frank\nGreystock! \"For the last year or two I have lived with this hope\nbefore me.\" \"And so have I,\" said Lucy. \"And so have I;--with that\nand no other.\" \"Too great confidence! Traitor,\" she said again,\nsmiling and weeping, \"yes, traitor; when of course you knew it.\" \"Is\nhis happiness in my hands? Oh,--then he shall be happy.\" \"Of course I\nwill tell Lady Fawn at once;--instantly. Dear Lady Fawn! But yet she\nhas been so wrong. I suppose she will let him come here. But what\ndoes it matter, now that I know it?\" \"Yours ever and always,--if you\nwill have me.--F. G.\" \"Traitor, traitor, traitor!\" Then she got up\nand walked about the room, not knowing what she did, holding the\nletter now between her hands, and then pressing it to her lips.\n\nShe was still walking about the room when there came a low tap at the\ndoor, and Lady Fawn entered. \"There is nothing the matter, Lucy?\"\nLucy stood stock still, with her treasure still clasped, smiling,\nalmost laughing, while the tears ran down her cheeks. \"Won't you eat\nyour breakfast, my dear?\" said Lady Fawn.\n\n\"Oh, Lady Fawn--oh, Lady Fawn!\" said Lucy, rushing into her friend's\narms.\n\n\"What is it, Lucy? I think our little wise one has lost her wits.\"\n\n\"Oh, Lady Fawn, he has asked me!\"\n\n\"Is it Mr. Greystock?\"\n\n\"Yes;--Mr. Greystock. He has asked me. He has asked me to be his\nwife. I thought he loved me. I hoped he did, at least. Oh dear, I did\nso hope it! And he does!\"\n\n\"Has he proposed to you?\"\n\n\"Yes, Lady Fawn. I told you what he said to me. And then he went and\nwrote this. Is he not noble and good,--and so kind? You shall read\nit,--but you'll give it me back, Lady Fawn?\"\n\n\"Certainly I'll give it you back. You don't think I'd rob you of your\nlover's letter?\"\n\n\"Perhaps you might think it right.\"\n\n\"If it is really an offer of marriage--,\" said Lady Fawn very\nseriously.\n\n\"It couldn't be more of an offer if he had sat writing it for ever,\"\nsaid Lucy as she gave up her letter with confidence. Lady Fawn read\nit with leisurely attention, and smiled as she put the paper back\ninto the envelope. \"All the men in the world couldn't say it more\nplainly,\" said Lucy, nodding her head forward.\n\n\"I don't think they could,\" said Lady Fawn. \"I never read anything\nplainer in my life. I wish you joy with all my heart, Lucy. There is\nnot a word to be said against him.\"\n\n\"Against him!\" said Lucy, who thought that this was very insufficient\npraise.\n\n\"What I mean is, that when I objected to his coming here I was only\nafraid that he couldn't afford,--or would think, you know, that in\nhis position he couldn't afford to marry a wife without a fortune.\"\n\n\"He may come now, Lady Fawn?\"\n\n\"Well,--yes; I think so. I shall be glad just to say a word to him.\nOf course you are in my hands, and I do love you so dearly, Lucy! I\ncould not bear that anything but good should happen to you.\"\n\n\"This is good,\" said Lucy.\n\n\"It won't be good, and Mr. Greystock won't think you good, if you\ndon't come and eat your breakfast.\" So Lucy was led back into the\nparlour, and sipped her tea and crunched her toast, while Lydia came\nand stood over her.\n\n\"Of course it is from him?\" whispered Lydia. Lucy again nodded her\nhead while she was crunching her toast.\n\nThe fact that Mr. Greystock had proposed in form to Lucy Morris\nwas soon known to all the family, and the news certainly did take\naway something from the importance which would otherwise have been\nattached to Lizzie's departure. There was not the same awe of\nthe ceremony, the same dread of some scene, which, but for Frank\nGreystock's letter, would have existed. Of course, Lord Fawn's future\nmatrimonial prospects were to them all an affair of more moment\nthan those of Lucy; but Lord Fawn himself had gone, and had already\nquarrelled with the lady before he went. There was at present nothing\nmore to be done by them in regard to Lizzie, than just to get rid of\nher. But Lucy's good fortune, so unexpected, and by her so frankly\nowned as the very best fortune in the world that could have befallen\nher, gave an excitement to them all. There could be no lessons that\nmorning for Nina, and the usual studies of the family were altogether\ninterrupted. Lady Fawn purred, and congratulated, and gave good\nadvice, and declared that any other home for Lucy before her marriage\nwould now be quite out of the question. \"Of course it wouldn't do for\nyou to go even to Clara,\" said Lady Fawn,--who seemed to think that\nthere still might be some delay before Frank Greystock would be ready\nfor his wife. \"You know, my dear, that he isn't rich;--not for a\nmember of Parliament. I suppose he makes a good income, but I have\nalways heard that he was a little backward when he began. Of course,\nyou know, nobody need be in a hurry.\" Then Lucy began to think that\nif Frank should wish to postpone his marriage,--say for three or four\nyears,--she might even yet become a burthen on her friend. \"But don't\nyou be frightened,\" continued Lady Fawn; \"you shall never want a home\nas long as I have one to give you. We shall soon find out what are\nMr. Greystock's ideas; and unless he is very unreasonable we'll make\nthings fit.\"\n\nThen there came a message to Lucy from Lady Eustace. \"If you please,\nmiss, Lady Eustace will be glad to see you for a minute up in her\nroom before she starts.\" So Lucy was torn away from the thoughts of\nher own happiness, and taken up-stairs to Lady Eustace. \"You have\nheard that I am going?\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"Yes;--I heard you were to go this morning.\"\n\n\"And you have heard why? I'm sure you will not deceive me, Lucy.\nWhere am I to look for truth, if not to an old, old friend like you?\"\n\n\"Why should I deceive you, Lizzie?\"\n\n\"Why, indeed? only that all people do. The world is so false, so\nmaterial, so worldly! One gives out one's heart and gets in return\nnothing but dust and ashes,--nothing but ashes and dust. Oh, I have\nbeen so disappointed in Lady Fawn!\"\n\n\"You know she is my dearest friend,\" said Lucy.\n\n\"Psha! I know that you have worked for her like a slave, and that she\ngives you but a bare pittance.\"\n\n\"She has been more like a mother to me than anything else,\" said Lucy\nangrily.\n\n\"Because you have been tame. It does not suit me to be tame. It is\nnot my plan to be tame. Have you heard the cause of the disagreement\nbetween Lord Fawn and me?\"\n\n\"Well,--no.\"\n\n\"Tell the truth, Lucy.\"\n\n\"How dare you tell me to tell the truth? Of course I tell the truth.\nI believe it is something about some property which he wants you to\ngive back to somebody; but I don't know any more.\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear husband, Sir Florian, who understood me,--whom I\nidolized,--who seemed to have been made for me,--gave me a present.\nLord Fawn is pleased to say that he does not approve of my keeping\nany gift from my late lord. Considering that he intends to live\nupon the wealth which Sir Florian was generous enough to bestow\nupon me, this does seem to be strange! Of course, I resented such\ninterference. Would not you have resented it?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Lucy, who thought that she could bring herself\nto comply with any request made to her by Frank Greystock.\n\n\"Any woman who had a spark of spirit would resent it, and I have\nresented it. I have told Lord Fawn that I will, on no account, part\nwith the rich presents which my adored Florian showered upon me in\nhis generosity. It is not for their richness that I keep them, but\nbecause they are, for his sake, so inexpressibly dear to me. If Lord\nFawn chooses to be jealous of a necklace, he must be jealous.\" Lucy,\nwho had, in truth, heard but a small fragment of the story,--just so\nmuch of it as Lydia had learned from the discreet Amelia, who herself\nhad but a very hazy idea of the facts,--did not quite know how\nmuch of the tale, as it was now told to her, might be true and how\nmuch false. After a certain fashion she and Lizzie Eustace called\nthemselves friends. But she did not believe her friend to be honest,\nand was aware that in some matters her friend would condescend--to\nfib. Lizzie's poetry, and romance, and high feelings, had never had\nthe ring of true soundness in Lucy's ears. But her imagination was\nnot strong enough to soar to the altitude of the lies which Lizzie\nwas now telling. She did believe that the property which Lizzie was\ncalled upon to restore was held to be objectionable by Lord Fawn\nsimply because it had reached Lizzie from the hands of her late\nhusband. \"What do you think of such conduct as that?\" asked Lady\nEustace.\n\n\"Won't it do if you lock them up instead of wearing them?\" asked\nLucy.\n\n\"I have never dreamed of wearing them.\"\n\n\"I don't understand about such things,\" said Lucy, determined not to\nimpute any blame to one of the Fawn family.\n\n\"It is tyranny, sheer tyranny,\" continued the other, \"and he will\nfind that I am not the woman to yield to it. No. For love I could\ngive up everything;--but nothing from fear. He has told me in so many\nwords that he does not intend to go on with his engagement!\"\n\n\"Has he indeed?\"\n\n\"But I intend that he shall. If he thinks that I am going to be\nthrown over because he takes ideas of that kind into his head, he's\nmistaken. He shall know that I'm not to be made a plaything of like\nthat. I'll tell you what you can do for me, Lucy.\"\n\n\"What can I do for you?\"\n\n\"There is no one in the world I trust more thoroughly than I do you,\"\nsaid Lizzie,--\"and hardly any one that I love so well. Think how long\nwe have known each other! And you may be sure of this;--I always have\nbeen, and always will be, your friend with my cousin Frank.\"\n\n\"I don't want anything of that kind,\" said Lucy,--\"and never did.\"\n\n\"Nobody has so much influence with Frank as I. Just do you write to\nme to-morrow, and the next day,--and the day after,--a mere line, you\nknow, to tell me how the land lies here.\"\n\n\"There would be nothing to tell.\"\n\n\"Yes, there will; ever so much. They will be talking about me every\nhour. If you'll be true to me, Lucy, in this business, I'll make you\nthe handsomest present you ever saw in your life. I'll give you a\nhundred-guinea brooch;--I will, indeed. You shall have the money, and\nbuy it yourself.\"\n\n\"A what!\" said Lucy.\n\n\"A hundred guineas to do what you please with!\"\n\n\"You mean thing!\" said Lucy. \"I didn't think there was a woman so\nmean as that in the world. I'm not surprised now at Lord Fawn. Pick\nup what I hear, and send it you in letters,--and then be paid money\nfor it!\"\n\n\"Why not? It's all to do good.\"\n\n\"How can you have thought to ask me to do such a thing? How can you\nbring yourself to think so badly of people? I'd sooner cut my hand\noff; and as for you, Lizzie--I think you are mean and wicked to\nconceive such a thing. And now good-bye.\" So saying, she left the\nroom, giving her dear friend no time for further argument.\n\nLady Eustace got away that morning, not in time, indeed, for the\n11.30 train, but at such an hour as to make it unnecessary that she\nshould appear at the early dinner. The saying of farewell was very\ncold and ceremonious. Of course, there was no word as to any future\nvisit,--no word as to any future events whatever. They all shook\nhands with her, and special injunctions were given to the coachman\nto drive her safely to the station. At this ceremony Lucy was not\npresent. Lydia had asked her to come down and say good-bye; but Lucy\nrefused. \"I saw her in her own room,\" said Lucy.\n\n\"And was it all very affectionate?\" Lydia asked.\n\n\"Well--no; it was not affectionate at all.\" This was all that Lucy\nsaid, and thus Lady Eustace completed her visit to Fawn Court.\n\nThe letters were taken away for the post at eight o'clock in the\nevening, and before that time it was necessary that Lucy should write\nto her lover. \"Lady Fawn,\" she said in a whisper, \"may I tell him to\ncome here?\"\n\n\"Certainly, my dear. You had better tell him to call on me. Of course\nhe'll see you, too, when he comes.\"\n\n\"I think he'd want to see me,\" said Lucy, \"and I'm sure I should want\nto see him!\" Then she wrote her answer to Frank's letter. She allowed\nherself an hour for the happy task; but though the letter, when\nwritten, was short, the hour hardly sufficed for the writing of it.\n\n\"DEAR MR. GREYSTOCK;\"--there was matter for her of great\nconsideration before she could get even so far as this; but, after\nbiting her pen for ten minutes, during which she pictured to herself\nhow pleasant it would be to call him Frank when he should have told\nher to do so, and had found, upon repeated whispered trials, that of\nall names it was the pleasantest to pronounce, she decided upon\nrefraining from writing it now--\n\n\n   Lady Fawn has seen your letter to me,--the dearest letter\n   that ever was written,--and she says that you may call\n   upon _her_. But you mustn't go away without seeing _me\n   too_.\n\n\nThen there was great difficulty as to the words to be used by her for\nthe actual rendering herself up to him as his future wife. At last\nthe somewhat too Spartan simplicity of her nature prevailed, and the\nwords were written, very plain and very short.\n\n\n   I love you better than all the world, and I will be your\n   wife. It shall be the happiness of my life to try to\n   deserve you.\n\n   I am, with all my heart,\n   Most affectionately your own\n\n   LUCY.\n\n\nWhen it was written it did not content her. But the hour was over,\nand the letters must go. \"I suppose it'll do,\" she said to herself.\n\"He'll know what it means.\" And so the letter was sent.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nCertainly an Heirloom\n\n\nThe burden of his position was so heavy on Lord Fawn's mind that, on\nthe Monday morning after leaving Fawn Court, he was hardly as true to\nthe affairs of India as he himself would have wished. He was resolved\nto do what was right,--if only he could find out what would be the\nright thing in his present difficulty. Not to break his word, not\nto be unjust, not to deviate by a hair's breadth from that line of\nconduct which would be described as \"honourable\" in the circle to\nwhich he belonged; not to give his political enemies an opportunity\nfor calumny,--this was all in all to him. The young widow was very\nlovely and very rich, and it would have suited him well to marry her.\nIt would still suit him well to do so, if she would make herself\namenable to reason and the laws. He had assured himself that he was\nvery much in love with her, and had already, in his imagination,\nreceived the distinguished heads of his party at Portray Castle.\nBut he would give all this up,--love, income, beauty, and\ncastle,--without a doubt, rather than find himself in the mess of\nhaving married a wife who had stolen a necklace, and who would not\nmake restitution. He might marry her, and insist on giving it up\nafterwards; but he foresaw terrible difficulties in the way of such\nan arrangement. Lady Eustace was self-willed, and had already told\nhim that she did not intend to keep the jewels in his house,--but in\nher own! What should he do, so that no human being,--not the most\nbigoted Tory that ever expressed scorn for a Whig lord,--should be\nable to say that he had done wrong? He was engaged to the lady, and\ncould not simply change his mind and give no reason. He believed in\nMr. Camperdown; but he could hardly plead that belief, should he\nhereafter be accused of heartless misconduct. For aught he knew,\nLady Eustace might bring an action against him for breach of\npromise, and obtain a verdict and damages, and annihilate him as an\nUnder-Secretary. How should he keep his hands quite clean?\n\nFrank Greystock was, as far as he knew, Lizzie's nearest relative\nin London. The dean was her uncle, but then the dean was down\nat Bobsborough. It might be necessary for him to go down to\nBobsborough;--but in the meantime he would see Frank Greystock.\nGreystock was as bitter a Tory as any in England. Greystock was the\nvery man who had attacked him, Lord Fawn, in the House of Commons\nrespecting the Sawab,--making the attack quite personal,--and that\nwithout a shadow of a cause! Within the short straight grooves of\nLord Fawn's intellect the remembrance of this supposed wrong was\nalways running up and down, renewing its own soreness. He regarded\nGreystock as an enemy who would lose no opportunity of injuring him.\nIn his weakness and littleness he was quite unable to judge of other\nmen by himself. He would not go a hair's breadth astray, if he knew\nit; but because Greystock had, in debate, called him timid and\ntyrannical, he believed that Greystock would stop short of nothing\nthat might injure him. And yet he must appeal to Greystock. He did\nappeal, and in answer to his appeal Frank came to him at the India\nHouse. But Frank, before he saw Lord Fawn, had, as was fitting, been\nwith his cousin.\n\nNothing was decided at this interview. Lord Fawn became more than\never convinced that the member for Bobsborough was his determined\nenemy, and Frank was more convinced than ever that Lord Fawn was an\nempty, stiff-necked, self-sufficient prig.\n\nGreystock, of course, took his cousin's part. He was there to do so;\nand he himself really did not know whether Lizzie was or was not\nentitled to the diamonds. The lie which she had first fabricated for\nthe benefit of Mr. Benjamin when she had the jewels valued, and which\nshe had since told with different degrees of precision to various\npeople,--to Lady Linlithgow, to Mr. Camperdown, to Lucy, and to Lord\nFawn,--she now repeated with increased precision to her cousin. Sir\nFlorian, in putting the trinket into her hands, had explained to her\nthat it was very valuable, and that she was to regard it as her own\npeculiar property. \"If it was an heirloom he couldn't do it,\" Frank\nhad said, with all the confidence of a practising barrister.\n\n\"He made it over as an heirloom to me,\" said Lizzie, with plaintive\ntenderness.\n\n\"That's nonsense, dear Lizzie.\" Then she smiled sweetly on him, and\npatted the back of his hand with hers. She was very gentle with him,\nand bore his assumed superiority with pretty meekness. \"He could not\nmake it over as an heirloom to you. If it was his to give, he could\ngive it you.\"\n\n\"It was his,--certainly.\"\n\n\"That is just what I cannot tell as yet, and what must be found out.\nIf the diamonds formed part of an heirloom,--and there is evidence\nthat it is so,--you must give them up. Sir Florian could only give\naway what was his own to give.\"\n\n\"But Lord Fawn had no right to dictate.\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" said Frank; and then he made a promise, which he\nknew to be rash, that he would stand by his pretty cousin in this\naffair. \"I don't see why you should assume that Lady Eustace is\nkeeping property that doesn't belong to her,\" he said to Lord Fawn.\n\n\"I go by what Camperdown tells me,\" said Lord Fawn.\n\n\"Mr. Camperdown is a very excellent attorney, and a most respectable\nman,\" said Greystock. \"I have nothing on earth to say against Mr.\nCamperdown. But Mr. Camperdown isn't the law and the prophets, nor\nyet can we allow him to be judge and jury in such a case as this.\"\n\n\"Surely, Mr. Greystock, you wouldn't wish it to go before a jury.\"\n\n\"You don't understand me, Lord Fawn. If any claim be really made\nfor these jewels by Mr. John Eustace on the part of the heir, or on\nbehalf of the estate, a statement had better be submitted to counsel.\nThe family deeds must be inspected, and no doubt counsel would agree\nin telling my cousin, Lady Eustace, what she should, or what she\nshould not do. In the meantime, I understand that you are engaged to\nmarry her?\"\n\n\"I was engaged to her, certainly,\" said Lord Fawn.\n\n\"You can hardly mean to assert, my lord, that you intend to be untrue\nto your promise, and to throw over your own engagement because my\ncousin has expressed her wish to retain property which she believes\nto be her own!\" This was said in a tone which made Lord Fawn surer\nthan ever that Greystock was his enemy to the knife. Personally, he\nwas not a coward; and he knew enough of the world to be quite sure\nthat Greystock would not attempt any personal encounter. But morally,\nLord Fawn was a coward, and he did fear that the man before him\nwould work him some bitter injury. \"You cannot mean that,\" continued\nFrank, \"and you will probably allow me to assure my cousin that she\nmisunderstood you in the matter.\"\n\n\"I'd sooner see Mr. Camperdown again before I say anything.\"\n\n\"I cannot understand, Lord Fawn, that a gentleman should require an\nattorney to tell him what to do in such a case as this.\" They were\nstanding now, and Lord Fawn's countenance was heavy, troubled, and\nfull of doubt. He said nothing, and was probably altogether unaware\nhow eloquent was his face. \"My cousin, Lady Eustace,\" continued\nFrank, \"must not be kept in this suspense. I agree on her behalf that\nher title to these trinkets must be made the subject of inquiry by\npersons adequate to form a judgment. Of course, I, as her relative,\nshall take no part in that inquiry. But, as her relative, I must\ndemand from you an admission that your engagement with her cannot in\nany way be allowed to depend on the fate of those jewels. She has\nchosen to accept you as her future husband, and I am bound to see\nthat she is treated with good faith, honour, and fair observance.\"\n\nFrank made his demand very well, while Lord Fawn was looking like a\nwhipped dog. \"Of course,\" said his lordship, \"all I want is, that the\nright thing should be done.\"\n\n\"The right thing will be done. My cousin wishes to keep nothing that\nis not her own. I may tell her, then, that she will receive from you\nan assurance that you have had no intention of departing from your\nword?\" After this, Lord Fawn made some attempt at a stipulation that\nthis assurance to Lizzie was to be founded on the counter-assurance\ngiven to him that the matter of the diamonds should be decided by\nproper legal authority; but Frank would not submit to this, and at\nlast the Under-Secretary yielded. The engagement was to remain in\nforce. Counsel were to be employed. The two lovers were not to see\neach other just at present. And when the matter had been decided by\nthe lawyers, Lord Fawn was to express his regret for having suspected\nhis lady-love! That was the verbal agreement, according to Frank\nGreystock's view of it. Lord Fawn, no doubt, would have declared that\nhe had never consented to the latter stipulation.\n\nAbout a week after this there was a meeting at Mr. Camperdown's\nchambers. Greystock, as his cousin's friend, attended to hear what\nMr. Camperdown had to say in the presence of Lord Fawn and John\nEustace. He, Frank, had, in the meantime, been down to Richmond, had\ntaken Lucy to his arms as his future bride, and had been closeted\nwith Lady Fawn. As a man who was doing his duty by Lucy Morris,\nhe was welcomed and made much of by her ladyship; but it had been\nimpossible to leave Lizzie's name altogether unmentioned, and Frank\nhad spoken as the champion of his cousin. Of course there had arisen\nsomething of ill-feeling between the two. Lady Fawn had taught\nherself to hate Lizzie, and was desirous that the match should be\nover, diamonds or no diamonds. She could not quite say this to\nher visitor, but she showed her feeling very plainly. Frank was\ncourteous, cold, and resolute in presuming, or pretending to presume,\nthat as a matter of course the marriage would take place. Lady Fawn\nintended to be civil, but she could not restrain her feeling; and\nthough she did not dare to say that her son would have nothing more\nto do with Lizzie Eustace, she showed very plainly that she intended\nto work with that object. Of course, the two did not part as cordial\nfriends, and of course poor Lucy perceived that it was so.\n\nBefore the meeting took place, Mr. Camperdown had been at work,\nlooking over old deeds. It is undoubtedly the case that things often\nbecome complicated which, from the greatness of their importance,\nshould have been kept clear as running water. The diamonds in\nquestion had been bought, with other jewels, by Sir Florian's\ngrandfather, on the occasion of his marriage with the daughter of a\ncertain duke,--on which occasion old family jewels, which were said\nto have been heirlooms, were sold or given in exchange as part value\nfor those then purchased. This grandfather, who had also been Sir\nFlorian in his time, had expressly stated in his will that these\njewels were to be regarded as an heirloom in the family, and had\nas such left them to his eldest son, and to that son's eldest son,\nshould such a child be born. His eldest son had possessed them, but\nnot that son's son. There was such an Eustace born, but he had died\nbefore his father. The younger son of that old Sir Florian had then\nsucceeded, as Sir Thomas, and he was the father of that Florian who\nhad married Lizzie Eustace. That last Sir Florian had therefore been\nthe fourth in succession from the old Sir Florian by whom the will\nhad been made, and who had directed that these jewels should be\nregarded as heirlooms in the family. The two intermediate baronets\nhad made no allusion to the diamonds in any deeds executed by them.\nIndeed, Sir Florian's father had died without a will. There were\nother jewels, larger but much less valuable than the diamonds, still\nin the hands of the Messrs. Garnett, as to which no question was\nraised. The late Sir Florian had, by his will, left all the property\nin his house at Portray to his widow, but all property elsewhere to\nhis heir. This was what Mr. Camperdown had at last learned, but he\nhad been forced to admit to himself, while learning this, that there\nwas confusion.\n\nHe was confident enough, however, that there was no difficulty in\nthe matter. The Messrs. Garnett were able to say that the necklace\nhad been in their keeping, with various other jewels still in their\npossession, from the time of the death of the late Lady Eustace, up\nto the marriage of the late Sir Florian, her son. They stated the\ndate on which the jewels were given up to be the 24th of September,\nwhich was the day after Sir Florian's return from Scotland with his\nbride. Lizzie's first statement had coincided with this entry in\nthe Messrs. Garnett's books; but latterly she had asserted that the\nnecklace had been given to her in Scotland. When Mr. Camperdown\nexamined the entry himself in the jewellers' book, he found the\nfigures to be so blotted that they might represent either the 4th or\n24th September. Now, the 4th September had been the day preceding\nSir Florian's marriage. John Eustace only knew that he had seen the\nnecklace worn in Scotland by his mother. The bishop only knew that\nhe had often seen them on the neck of his sister-in-law when, as\nwas very often the case, she appeared in full-blown society. Mr.\nCamperdown believed that he had traced two stories to Lizzie,--one,\nrepeated more than once, that the diamonds had been given to her in\nLondon, and a second, made to himself, that they had been given to\nher at Portray. He himself believed that they had never been in\nScotland since the death of the former Lady Eustace; but he was quite\nconfident that he could trust altogether to the disposition made of\nthem by the old Sir Florian. There could be no doubt as to these\nbeing the diamonds there described, although the setting had been\naltered. Old Mr. Garnett stated that he would swear to them if he saw\nthe necklace.\n\n\"You cannot suppose that Lady Eustace wishes to keep anything that is\nnot her own,\" said Frank Greystock.\n\n\"Of course not,\" said John Eustace.\n\n\"Nobody imagines it,\" said Mr. Camperdown. Lord Fawn, who felt that\nhe ought not to be there, and who did not know whether he might\nwith a better grace take Lizzie's part or a part against her, said\nnothing. \"But,\" continued Mr. Camperdown, \"there is luckily no doubt\nas to the facts. The diamonds in question formed a part of a set of\nmost valuable ornaments settled in the family by Sir Florian Eustace\nin 1799. The deed was drawn up by my grandfather, and is now here.\nI do not know how we are to have further proof. Will you look at\nthe deed, Mr. Greystock, and at the will?\" Frank suggested that,\nas it might probably be expedient to take advice on the subject\nprofessionally, he had rather not look at the deed. Anything which he\nmight say, on looking at the document now, could have no weight. \"But\nwhy should any advice be necessary,\" said Mr. Camperdown, \"when the\nmatter is so clear?\"\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Frank, \"my cousin, Lady Eustace, is strong in her\nconfidence that her late husband intended to give them to her as her\nown, and that he would not have done this without the power of doing\nso.\" Now, Mr. Camperdown was quite sure that Lizzie was lying in\nthis, and could therefore make no adequate answer. \"Your experience\nmust probably have told you,\" continued Frank, \"that there is\nconsiderable difficulty in dealing with the matter of heirlooms.\"\n\n\"I never heard of any such difficulty,\" said Mr. Camperdown.\n\n\"People generally understand it all so clearly,\" said Lord Fawn.\n\n\"The late Sir Florian does not appear to have understood it very\nclearly,\" said Frank.\n\n\"Let her put them into the hands of any indifferent person or firm\ntill the matter is decided,\" said Mr. Camperdown. \"They will be much\nsafer so than in her keeping.\"\n\n\"I think they are quite safe,\" said Frank.\n\nAnd this was all that took place at that meeting. As Mr. Camperdown\nsaid to John Eustace, it was manifest enough that she meant \"to hang\non to them.\" \"I only hope Lord Fawn will not be fool enough to marry\nher,\" said Mr. Camperdown. Lord Fawn himself was of the same way of\nthinking;--but then how was he to clear his character of the charge\nwhich would be brought against him; and how was he to stand his\nground before Frank Greystock?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nThe Diamonds Are Seen in Public\n\n\nLet it not be supposed that Lady Eustace, during these summer weeks,\nwas living the life of a recluse. The London season was in its full\nsplendour, and she was by no means a recluse. During the first year\nof her widowhood she had been every inch a widow,--as far as crape\nwould go, and a quiet life either at Bobsborough or Portray Castle.\nDuring this year her child was born,--and she was in every way\nthrown upon her good behaviour, living with bishops' wives and deans'\ndaughters. Two years of retreat from the world is generally thought\nto be the proper thing for a widow. Lizzie had not quite accomplished\nher two years before she re-opened the campaign in Mount Street with\nvery small remnants of weeds, and with her crape brought down to a\nminimum;--but she was young and rich, and the world is aware that a\nwoman of twenty-two can hardly afford to sacrifice two whole years.\nIn the matter of her widowhood Lizzie did not encounter very much\nreproach. She was not shunned, or so ill spoken of as to have a\nwidely-spread bad name among the streets and squares in which her\ncarriage-wheels rolled. People called her a flirt, held up their\nhands in surprise at Sir Florian's foolish generosity,--for the\naccounts of Lizzie's wealth were greatly exaggerated,--and said that\nof course she would marry again.\n\nThe general belief which often seizes upon the world in regard to\nsome special falsehood is very surprising. Everybody on a sudden\nadopts an idea that some particular man is over head and ears\nin debt, so that he can hardly leave his house for fear of the\nbailiffs;--or that some ill-fated woman is cruelly ill-used by her\nhusband;--or that some eldest son has ruined his father; whereas the\nman doesn't owe a shilling, the woman never hears a harsh word from\nher lord, and the eldest son in question has never succeeded in\nobtaining a shilling beyond his allowance. One of the lies about\nLondon this season was founded on the extent of Lady Eustace's\njointure. Indeed, the lie went on to state that the jointure was\nmore than a jointure. It was believed that the property in Ayrshire\nwas her own, to do what she pleased with it. That the property in\nAyrshire was taken at double its value was a matter of course. It had\nbeen declared, at the time of his marriage, that Sir Florian had been\nespecially generous to his penniless wife, and the generosity was\nmagnified in the ordinary way. No doubt Lizzie's own diligence had\ndone much to propagate the story as to her positive ownership of\nPortray. Mr. Camperdown had been very busy denying this. John Eustace\nhad denied it whenever occasion offered. The bishop in his quiet way\nhad denied it. Lady Linlithgow had denied it. But the lie had been\nset on foot and had thriven, and there was hardly a man about town\nwho didn't know that Lady Eustace had eight or nine thousand a year,\naltogether at her own disposal, down in Scotland. Of course a woman\nso endowed, so rich, so beautiful, so clever, so young, would marry\nagain, and would marry well. No doubt, added to this there was a\nfeeling that \"Lizzie,\" as she was not uncommonly called by people who\nhad hardly ever seen her, had something amiss with it all. \"I don't\nknow where it is she's lame,\" said that very clever man, Captain\nBoodle, who had lately reappeared among his military friends at his\nclub, \"but she don't go flat all round.\"\n\n\"She has the devil of a temper, no doubt,\" said Lieutenant Griggs.\n\n\"No mouth, I should say,\" said Boodle. It was thus that Lizzie was\ntalked about at the clubs; but she was asked to dinners and balls,\nand gave little dinners herself, and to a certain extent was the\nfashion. Everybody had declared that of course she would marry again,\nand now it was known everywhere that she was engaged to Lord Fawn.\n\n\"Poor dear Lord Fawn!\" said Lady Glencora Palliser to her dear friend\nMadame Max Goesler; \"do you remember how violently he was in love\nwith Violet Effingham two years ago?\"\n\n\"Two years is a long time, Lady Glencora; and Violet Effingham has\nchosen another husband.\"\n\n\"But isn't this a fall for him? Violet was the sweetest girl out, and\nat one time I really thought she meant to take him.\"\n\n\"I thought she meant to take another man whom she did not take,\"\nsaid Madame Goesler, who had her own recollections, who was a widow\nherself, and who, at the period to which Lady Glencora was referring,\nhad thought that perhaps she might cease to be a widow. Not that she\nhad ever suggested to herself that Lord Fawn might be her second\nhusband.\n\n\"Poor Lord Fawn!\" continued Lady Glencora. \"I suppose he is terribly\nin want of money.\"\n\n\"But surely Lady Eustace is very pretty.\"\n\n\"Yes;--she is very pretty; nay more, she is quite lovely to look at.\nAnd she is clever,--very. And she is rich,--very. But--\"\n\n\"Well, Lady Glencora. What does your 'but' mean?\"\n\n\"Who ever explains a 'but'? You're a great deal too clever, Madame\nGoesler, to want any explanation. And I couldn't explain it. I can\nonly say I'm sorry for poor Lord Fawn,--who is a gentleman, but will\nnever set the Thames on fire.\"\n\n\"No, indeed. All the same, I like Lord Fawn extremely,\" said Madame\nGoesler, \"and I think he's just the man to marry Lady Eustace. He's\nalways at his office or at the House.\"\n\n\"A man may be a great deal at his office, and a great deal more at\nthe House than Lord Fawn,\" said Lady Glencora laughing, \"and yet\nthink about his wife, my dear.\" For of all men known, no man spent\nmore hours at the House or in his office than did Lady Glencora's\nhusband, Mr. Palliser, who at this time, and had now for more than\ntwo years, filled the high place of Chancellor of the Exchequer.\n\nThis conversation took place in Madame Goesler's little drawing-room\nin Park Lane; but, three days after this, the same two ladies\nmet again at the house then occupied by Lady Chiltern in Portman\nSquare,--Lady Chiltern, with whom, as Violet Effingham, poor Lord\nFawn had been much in love. \"I think it is the nicest match in the\nworld for him,\" Lady Chiltern had said to Madame Goesler.\n\n\"But have you heard of the diamonds?\" asked Lady Glencora.\n\n\"What diamonds?\" \"Whose diamonds?\" Neither of the others had heard\nof the diamonds, and Lady Glencora was able to tell her story. Lady\nEustace had found all the family jewels belonging to the Eustace\nfamily in the strong plate room at Portray Castle, and had taken\npossession of them as property found in her own house. John Eustace\nand the bishop had combined in demanding them on behalf of the\nheir, and a lawsuit had then commenced! The diamonds were the most\ncostly belonging to any Commoner in England, and had been valued\nat twenty-four thousand pounds! Lord Fawn had retreated from his\nengagement the moment he heard that any doubt was thrown on Lady\nEustace's right to their possession! Lady Eustace had declared her\nintention of bringing an action against Lord Fawn,--and had also\nsecreted the diamonds! The reader will be aware that this statement\nwas by no means an accurate history of the difficulty as far as it\nhad as yet progressed. It was, indeed, absolutely false in every\ndetail; but it sufficed to show that the matter was becoming public.\n\"You don't mean to say that Lord Fawn is off?\" asked Madame Goesler.\n\n\"I do,\" said Lady Glencora.\n\n\"Poor Lord Fawn!\" exclaimed Lady Chiltern. \"It really seems as though\nhe never would be settled.\"\n\n\"I don't think he has courage enough for such conduct as that,\" said\nMadame Goesler.\n\n\"And besides, Lady Eustace's income is quite certain,\" said Lady\nChiltern, \"and poor dear Lord Fawn does want money so badly.\"\n\n\"But it is very disagreeable,\" said Lady Glencora, \"to believe that\nyour wife has got the finest diamonds in England, and then to find\nthat she has only--stolen them. I think Lord Fawn is right. If a man\ndoes marry for money he should have the money. I wonder she ever took\nhim. There is no doubt about her beauty, and she might have done\nbetter.\"\n\n\"I won't hear Lord Fawn be-littled,\" said Lady Chiltern.\n\n\"Done better!\" said Madame Goesler. \"How could she have done better?\nHe is a peer, and her son would be a peer. I don't think she could\nhave done better.\" Lady Glencora in her time had wished to marry a\nman who had sought her for her money. Lady Chiltern in her time had\nrefused to be Lady Fawn. Madame Goesler in her time had declined\nto marry an English peer. There was, therefore, something more of\ninterest in the conversation to each of them than was quite expressed\nin the words spoken. \"Is she to be at your party on Friday, Lady\nGlencora?\" asked Madame Goesler.\n\n\"She has said she would come,--and so has Lord Fawn; for that matter,\nLord Fawn dines with us. She'll find that out, and then she'll stay\naway.\"\n\n\"Not she,\" said Lady Chiltern. \"She'll come for the sake of the\nbravado. She's not the woman to show the white feather.\"\n\n\"If he's ill-using her she's quite right,\" said Madame Goesler.\n\n\"And wear the very diamonds in dispute,\" said Lady Chiltern. It was\nthus that the matter was discussed among ladies in the town.\n\n\"Is Fawn's marriage going on?\" This question was asked of Mr. Legge\nWilson by Barrington Erle. Mr. Legge Wilson was the Secretary of\nState for India, and Barrington Erle was in the Government.\n\n\"Upon my word I don't know,\" said Mr. Wilson. \"The work goes on at\nthe office;--that's all I know about Fawn. He hasn't told me of his\nmarriage, and therefore I haven't spoken to him about it.\"\n\n\"He hasn't made it official?\"\n\n\"The papers haven't come before me yet,\" said Mr. Wilson.\n\n\"When they do they'll be very awkward papers, as far as I hear,\" said\nBarrington Erle. \"There is no doubt they were engaged, and I believe\nthere is no doubt that he has declared off, and refused to give any\nreason.\"\n\n\"I suppose the money is not all there,\" suggested Mr. Wilson.\n\n\"There's a queer story going about as to some diamonds. No one knows\nwhom they belong to, and they say that Fawn has accused her of\nstealing them. He wants to get hold of them, and she won't give them\nup. I believe the lawyers are to have a shy at it. I'm sorry for\nFawn. It'll do him a deal of mischief.\"\n\n\"You'll find he won't come out much amiss,\" said Mr. Legge Wilson.\n\"He's as cautious a man as there is in London. If there is anything\nwrong--\"\n\n\"There is a great deal wrong,\" said Barrington Erle.\n\n\"You'll find it will be on her side.\"\n\n\"And you'll find also that she'll contrive that all the blame shall\nlie upon him. She's clever enough for anything! Who's to be the new\nbishop?\"\n\n\"I have not heard Gresham say as yet; Jones, I should think,\" said\nMr. Wilson.\n\n\"And who is Jones?\"\n\n\"A clergyman, I suppose,--of the safe sort. I don't know that\nanything else is necessary.\" From which it will be seen that Mr.\nWilson had his own opinion about church matters, and also that people\nvery high up in the world were concerning themselves about poor\nLizzie's affairs.\n\nLady Eustace did go to Lady Glencora's evening party, in spite of Mr.\nCamperdown and all her difficulties. Lady Chiltern had been quite\nright in saying that Lizzie was not the woman to show the white\nfeather. She went, knowing that she would meet Lord Fawn, and she did\nwear the diamonds. It was the first time that they had been round her\nneck since the occasion in respect to which Sir Florian had placed\nthem in her hands, and it had not been without much screwing up of\nher courage that she had resolved to appear on this occasion with the\nmuch-talked-of ornament upon her person. It was now something over\na fortnight since she had parted with Lord Fawn at Fawn Court; and,\nalthough they were still presumed to be engaged to marry each other,\nand were both living in London, she had not seen him since. A sort\nof message had reached her, through Frank Greystock, to the effect\nthat Lord Fawn thought it as well that they should not meet till\nthe matter was settled. Stipulations had been made by Frank on her\nbehalf, and this had been inserted among them. She had received the\nmessage with scorn,--with a mixture of scorn and gratitude,--of\nscorn in regard to the man who had promised to marry her, and of\naffectionate gratitude to the cousin who had made the arrangement.\n\"Of course I shall not wish to see him while he chooses to entertain\nsuch an idea,\" she had said, \"but I shall not keep out of his way.\nYou would not wish me to keep out of his way, Frank?\" When she\nreceived a card for Lady Glencora's party, very soon after this, she\nwas careful to answer it in such a manner as to impress Lady Glencora\nwith a remembrance of her assent. Lord Fawn would probably be\nthere,--unless he remained away in order to avoid her. Then she had\nten days in which to make up her mind as to wearing the diamonds. Her\ncourage was good; but then her ignorance was so great! She did not\nknow whether Mr. Camperdown might not contrive to have them taken\nby violence from her neck, even on Lady Glencora's stairs. Her best\nsecurity,--so she thought,--would be in the fact that Mr. Camperdown\nwould not know of her purpose. She told no one,--not even Miss\nMacnulty; but she appeared before that lady, arrayed in all her\nglory, just as she was about to descend to her carriage. \"You've got\nthe necklace on!\" said Miss Macnulty. \"Why should I not wear my own\nnecklace?\" she asked, with assumed anger.\n\nLady Glencora's rooms were already very full when Lizzie entered\nthem, but she was without a gentleman, and room was made for her\nto pass quickly up the stairs. The diamonds had been recognised by\nmany before she had reached the drawing-room;--not that these very\ndiamonds were known, or that there was a special memory for that\nnecklace;--but the subject had been so generally discussed, that the\nblaze of the stones immediately brought it to the minds of men and\nwomen. \"There she is, with poor Eustace's twenty thousand pounds\nround her neck,\" said Laurence Fitzgibbon to his friend Barrington\nErle. \"And there is Lord Fawn going to look after them,\" replied the\nother.\n\nLord Fawn thought it right, at any rate, to look after his bride.\nLady Glencora had whispered into his ear before they went down to\ndinner that Lady Eustace would be there in the evening, so that he\nmight have the option of escaping or remaining. Could he have escaped\nwithout any one knowing that he had escaped, he would not have gone\nup-stairs after dinner; but he knew that he was observed; he knew\nthat people were talking about him; and he did not like it to be said\nthat he had run away. He went up, thinking much of it all, and as\nsoon as he saw Lady Eustace he made his way to her and accosted her.\nMany eyes were upon them, but no ear probably heard how infinitely\nunimportant were the words which they spoke to each other. Her manner\nwas excellent. She smiled and gave him her hand,--just her hand\nwithout the slightest pressure,--and spoke a half-whispered word,\nlooking into his face, but betraying nothing by her look. Then he\nasked her whether she would dance. Yes;--she would stand up for a\nquadrille; and they did stand up for a quadrille. As she danced with\nno one else, it was clear that she treated Lord Fawn as her lover.\nAs soon as the dance was done she took his arm and moved for a few\nminutes about the room with him. She was very conscious of the\ndiamonds, but she did not show the feeling in her face. He also was\nconscious of them, and he did show it. He did not recognise the\nnecklace, but he knew well that this was the very bone of contention.\nThey were very beautiful, and seemed to him to outshine all other\njewellery in the room. And Lady Eustace was a woman of whom it might\nalmost be said that she ought to wear diamonds. She was made to\nsparkle, to be bright with outside garniture,--to shine and glitter,\nand be rich in apparel. The only doubt might be whether paste\ndiamonds might not better suit her character. But these were not\npaste, and she did shine and glitter and was very rich. It must not\nbe brought as an accusation against Lady Glencora's guests that they\npressed round to look at the necklace. Lady Glencora's guests knew\nbetter than to do that. But there was some slight ferment,--slight,\nbut still felt both by Lord Fawn and by Lady Eustace. Eyes were\nturned upon the diamonds, and there were whispers here and there.\nLizzie bore it very well; but Lord Fawn was uncomfortable.\n\n\"I like her for wearing them,\" said Lady Glencora to Lady Chiltern.\n\n\"Yes;--if she means to keep them. I don't pretend, however, to know\nanything about it. You see the match isn't off.\"\n\n\"I suppose not. What do you think I did? He dined here, you know,\nand, before going down-stairs, I told him that she was coming. I\nthought it only fair.\"\n\n\"And what did he say?\"\n\n\"I took care that he shouldn't have to say anything; but, to tell the\ntruth, I didn't expect him to come up.\"\n\n\"There can't be any quarrel at all,\" said Lady Chiltern.\n\n\"I'm not sure of that,\" said Lady Glencora. \"They are not so very\nloving.\"\n\nLady Eustace made the most of her opportunity. Soon after the\nquadrille was over she asked Lord Fawn to get her carriage for her.\nOf course he got it, and of course he put her into it, passing up and\ndown-stairs twice in his efforts on her behalf. And of course all the\nworld saw what he was doing. Up to the last moment not a word had\nbeen spoken between them that might not have passed between the most\nordinary acquaintance, but, as she took her seat, she put her face\nforward and did say a word. \"You had better come to me soon,\" she\nsaid.\n\n\"I will,\" said Lord Fawn.\n\n\"Yes; you had better come soon. All this is wearing me,--perhaps more\nthan you think.\"\n\n\"I will come soon,\" said Lord Fawn, and then he returned among Lady\nGlencora's guests, very uncomfortable. Lizzie got home in safety and\nlocked up her diamonds in the iron box.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\n\"And I Have Nothing to Give\"\n\n\nIt was now the end of June, and Frank Greystock had been as yet but\nonce at Fawn Court since he had written to Lucy Morris asking her to\nbe his wife. That was three weeks since, and as the barrier against\nhim at Fawn Court had been removed by Lady Fawn herself, the Fawn\ngirls thought that as a lover he was very slack; but Lucy was not in\nthe least annoyed. Lucy knew that it was all right; for Frank, as he\ntook his last walk round the shrubbery with her during that visit,\nhad given her to understand that there was a little difference\nbetween him and Lady Fawn in regard to Lizzie Eustace. \"I am her only\nrelative in London,\" Frank had said.\n\n\"Lady Linlithgow,\" suggested Lucy.\n\n\"They have quarrelled, and the old woman is as bitter as gall. There\nis no one else to stand up for her, and I must see that she isn't\nill-used. Women do hate each other so virulently, and Lady Fawn hates\nher future daughter-in-law.\" Lucy did not in the least grudge her\nlover's assistance to his cousin. There was nothing of jealousy\nin her feeling. She thought that Lizzie was unworthy of Frank's\ngoodness, but on such an occasion as this she would not say so. She\ntold him nothing of the bribe that had been offered her, nor on that\nsubject had she said a word to any of the Fawns. She understood,\ntoo, that as Frank had declared his purpose of supporting Lizzie,\nit might be as well that he should see just at present as little of\nLady Fawn as possible. Not a word, however, had Lady Fawn said to\nLucy disparaging her lover for his conduct. It was quite understood\nnow at Fawn Court, by all the girls, and no doubt by the whole\nestablishment, that Lizzie Eustace was to be regarded as an enemy. It\nwas believed by them all that Lord Fawn had broken off the match--or,\nat least, that he was resolved to break it; but various stratagems\nwere to be used, and terrible engines of war were to be brought up,\nif necessary, to prevent an alliance which was now thought to be\ndisreputable. Mrs. Hittaway had been hard at work, and had found out\nsomething very like truth in regard to the whole transaction with Mr.\nBenjamin. Perhaps Mrs. Hittaway had found out more than was quite\ntrue as to poor Lizzie's former sins; but what she did find out she\nused with all her skill, communicating her facts to her mother, to\nMr. Camperdown, and to her brother. Her brother had almost quarrelled\nwith her, but still she continued to communicate her facts.\n\nAt this period Frank Greystock was certainly somewhat unreasonable in\nregard to his cousin. At one time, as the reader will remember, he\nhad thought of asking her to be his wife;--because she was rich; but\neven then he had not thought well of her, had hardly believed her\nto be honest, and had rejoiced when he found that circumstances\nrather than his own judgment had rescued him from that evil. He had\nprofessed to be delighted when Lord Fawn was accepted,--as being\nhappy to think that his somewhat dangerous cousin was provided with\nso safe a husband; and, when he had first heard of the necklace, he\nhad expressed an opinion that of course it would be given up. In all\nthis then he had shown no strong loyalty to his cousin, no very dear\nfriendship, nothing to make those who knew him feel that he would\nbuckle on armour in her cause. But of late,--and that, too, since his\nengagement with Lucy,--he had stood up very stoutly as her friend,\nand the armour was being buckled on. He had not scrupled to say that\nhe meant to see her through this business with Lord Fawn, and had\nsomewhat astonished Mr. Camperdown by raising a doubt on the question\nof the necklace. \"He can't but know that she has no more right to it\nthan I have,\" Mr. Camperdown had said to his son with indignation.\nMr. Camperdown was becoming unhappy about the necklace, not quite\nknowing how to proceed in the matter.\n\nIn the meantime Frank had obeyed his better instincts, and had asked\nLucy Morris to be his wife. He had gone to Fawn Court in compliance\nwith a promise to Lizzie Eustace, that he would call upon her there.\nHe had walked with Lucy because he was at Fawn Court. And he had\nwritten to Lucy because of the words he had spoken during the walk.\nIn all this the matter had arranged itself as such matters do, and\nthere was nothing, in truth, to be regretted. He really did love the\ngirl with all his heart. It may, perhaps, be said that he had never\nin truth loved any other woman. In the best humours of his mind he\nwould tell himself,--had from old times told himself often,--that\nunless he married Lucy Morris he could never marry at all. When his\nmother, knowing that poor Lucy was penniless, had, as mothers will\ndo, begged him to beware, he had spoken up for his love honestly,\ndeclaring to her that in his eyes there was no woman living equal to\nLucy Morris. The reader has seen him with the words almost on his\ntongue with which to offer his hand to his cousin, Lizzie Eustace,\nknowing as he did so that his heart had been given to Lucy,--knowing\nalso that Lucy's heart had been given to him! But he had not done it,\nand the better humour had prevailed.\n\nWithin the figure and frame and clothes and cuticle, within the bones\nand flesh of many of us, there is but one person,--a man or woman,\nwith a preponderance either of good or evil, whose conduct in any\nemergency may be predicted with some assurance of accuracy by any\none knowing the man or woman. Such persons are simple, single, and,\nperhaps, generally, safe. They walk along lines in accordance with\ncertain fixed instincts or principles, and are to-day as they were\nyesterday, and will be to-morrow as they are to-day. Lady Eustace was\nsuch a person, and so was Lucy Morris. Opposite in their characters\nas the two poles, they were, each of them, a simple entity; and any\ndoubt or error in judging of the future conduct of either of them\nwould come from insufficient knowledge of the woman. But there are\nhuman beings who, though of necessity single in body, are dual in\ncharacter;--in whose breasts not only is evil always fighting against\ngood,--but to whom evil is sometimes horribly, hideously evil, but is\nsometimes also not hideous at all. Of such men it may be said that\nSatan obtains an intermittent grasp, from which, when it is released,\nthe rebound carries them high amidst virtuous resolutions and a\nthorough love of things good and noble. Such men,--or women,--may\nhardly, perhaps, debase themselves with the more vulgar vices. They\nwill not be rogues, or thieves, or drunkards,--or, perhaps, liars;\nbut ambition, luxury, self-indulgence, pride, and covetousness will\nget a hold of them, and in various moods will be to them virtues in\nlieu of vices. Such a man was Frank Greystock, who could walk along\nthe banks of the quiet, trout-giving Bob, at Bobsborough, whipping\nthe river with his rod, telling himself that the world lost for love\nwould be a bad thing well lost for a fine purpose; and who could also\nstand, with his hands in his trousers pockets, looking down upon the\npavement, in the purlieus of the courts at Westminster, and swear\nto himself that he would win the game, let the cost to his heart be\nwhat it might. What must a man be who would allow some undefined\nfeeling,--some inward ache which he calls a passion and cannot\nanalyse, some desire which has come of instinct and not of\njudgment,--to interfere with all the projects of his intellect,\nwith all the work which he has laid out for his accomplishment?\nCircumstances had thrown him into a path of life for which, indeed,\nhis means were insufficient, but which he regarded as, of all paths,\nthe noblest and the manliest. If he could be true to himself,--with\nsuch truth as at these moments would seem to him to be the truest\ntruth,--there was nothing in rank, nothing in ambition, which\nmight not be within his reach. He might live with the highest, the\nbest-educated, and the most beautiful; he might assist in directing\nnational councils by his intelligence; and might make a name for\nhimself which should be remembered in his country, and of which men\nwould read the records in the histories written in after ages. But to\ndo this, he must walk warily. He, an embarrassed man, a man already\nin debt, a man with no realised property coming to him in reversion,\nwas called upon to live, and to live as though at his ease, among\nthose who had been born to wealth. And, indeed, he had so cleverly\nlearned the ways of the wealthy, that he hardly knew any longer how\nto live at his ease among the poor.\n\nBut had he walked warily when he went down to Richmond, and\nafterwards, sitting alone in the obscurity of his chamber, wrote the\nletter which had made Lucy Morris so happy? It must be acknowledged\nthat he did, in truth, love the girl,--that he was capable of a\nstrong feeling. She was not beautiful,--hardly even pretty, small,\nin appearance almost insignificant, quite penniless, a governess! He\nhad often asked himself what it was that had so vanquished him. She\nalways wore a pale grey frock,--with, perhaps, a grey ribbon,--never\nrunning into any bright form of clothing. She was educated, very\nwell-educated; but she owned no great accomplishment. She had not\nsung his heart away, or ravished him with the harp. Even of her words\nshe was sparing, seeming to care more to listen than to speak; a\nhumble little thing to look at,--one of whom you might say that she\nregarded herself as well-placed if left in the background. Yet he\nhad found her out, and knew her. He had recognised the treasure, and\nhad greatly desired to possess it. He had confessed to himself that,\ncould splendour and ambition be laid aside, that little thing would\nbe all the world to him. As he sat in court, or in the House, patient\nfrom practice as he half-listened to the ponderous speeches of\nadvocates or politicians, he would think of the sparkle in her eye,\nof the dimple in her chin, of the lines of the mouth which could\nplead so eloquently, though with few words. To sit on some high seat\namong his countrymen, and also to marry Lucy Morris,--that would be a\nhigh ambition. He had chosen his way now, and she was engaged to be\nhis wife.\n\nAs he thought of it after he had done it, it was not all happiness,\nall contentment, with him. He did feel that he had crippled\nhimself,--impeded himself in running the race, as it were, with a\nlog round his leg. He had offered to marry her, and he must do so at\nonce, or almost at once, because she could now find no other home but\nhis. He knew, as well as did Lady Fawn, that she could not go into\nanother family as governess; and he knew also that she ought not to\nremain in Lady Fawn's house an hour longer than she would be wanted\nthere. He must alter his plan of living at once, give up the luxury\nof his rooms at the Grosvenor, take a small house somewhere, probably\nnear the Swiss Cottage, come up and down to his chambers by the\nunderground railway, and, in all probability, abandon Parliament\naltogether. He was not sure whether, in good faith, he should not at\nonce give notice of his intended acceptance of the Chiltern Hundreds\nto the electors of Bobsborough. Thus meditating, under the influence\nof that intermittent evil grasp, almost angry with himself for the\nopen truth which he had spoken,--or rather written, and perhaps\nthinking more of Lizzie and her beauty than he should have done, in\nthe course of three weeks he had paid but one visit to Fawn Court.\nThen, of a sudden, finding himself one afternoon relieved from work,\nhe resolved to go there. The days were still almost at their longest,\nand he did not scruple to present himself before Lady Fawn between\neight and nine in the evening. They were all at tea, and he was\nwelcomed kindly. Lucy, when he was announced, at once got up and met\nhim almost at the doorway, sparkling with just a tear of joy in her\neye, with a look in her face, and a loving manner, which for the\nmoment made him sure that the little house near the Swiss Cottage\nwould, after all, be the only Elysium upon earth. If she spoke a word\nhe hardly heard it, but her hand was in his, so cool and soft, almost\ntrembling in its grasp, with no attempt to withdraw itself, frank,\nloving, and honest. There was a perfect satisfaction in her greeting\nwhich at once told him that she had no discontented thoughts,--had\nhad no such thought,--because he had been so long without coming. To\nsee him was a great joy. But every hour of her life was a joy to her,\nknowing, as she did know, that he loved her.\n\nLady Fawn was gracious, the girls were hospitable, and he found\nhimself made very welcome amidst all the women at the tea-table.\nNot a word was said about Lizzie Eustace. Lady Fawn talked about\nParliament, and professed to pity a poor lover who was so bound\nto his country that he could not see his mistress above once a\nfortnight. \"But there'll be a good time coming next month,\" she\nsaid;--for it was now July. \"Though the girls can't make their claims\nfelt, the grouse can.\"\n\n\"It isn't the House altogether that rules me with a rod of iron, Lady\nFawn,\" said Frank, \"but the necessity of earning daily bread by the\nsweat of my brow. A man who has to sit in court all day must take the\nnight,--or, indeed, any time that he can get,--to read up his cases.\"\n\n\"But the grouse put a stop to all work,\" said Lady Fawn. \"My gardener\ntold me just now that he wanted a day or two in August. I don't doubt\nbut that he is going to the moors. Are you going to the moors, Mr.\nGreystock?\"\n\nAs it happened, Frank Greystock did not quite know whether he was\ngoing to the moors or not. The Ayrshire grouse-shooting is not the\nbest in Scotland;--but there is grouse-shooting in Ayrshire; and the\nshooting on the Portray mountains is not the worst shooting in the\ncounty. The castle at Portray overhangs the sea, but there is a wild\ndistrict attached to it stretching far back inland, in regard to\nwhich Lizzie Eustace was very proud of talking of \"her shooting.\"\nEarly in the spring of the present year she had asked her cousin\nFrank to accept the shooting for the coming season,--and he had\naccepted it. \"I shall probably be abroad,\" she said, \"but there\nis the old castle.\" She had offered it as though he had been her\nbrother, and he had said that he would go down for a couple of\nweeks,--not to the castle, but to a little lodge some miles up from\nthe sea, of which she told him when he declined the castle. When this\ninvitation was given there was no engagement between her and Lord\nFawn. Since that date, within the last day or two, she had reminded\nhim of it. \"Won't his lordship be there?\" he had said laughingly.\n\"Certainly not,\" she had answered with serious earnestness. Then she\nhad explained that her plan of going abroad had been set aside by\ncircumstances. She did mean to go down to Portray. \"I couldn't have\nyou at the castle,\" she said, smiling; \"but even an Othello couldn't\nobject to a first cousin at a little cottage ever so many miles\noff.\" It wasn't for him to suggest what objections might rise to the\nbrain of a modern Othello; but after some hesitation he said that he\nwould be there. He had promised the trip to a friend, and would like\nto keep his promise. But, nevertheless, he almost thought that he\nought to avoid Portray. He intended to support his cousin as far as\nhe might do so honestly; but he was not quite minded to stand by\nher through good report and evil report. He did not desire to be\nspecially known as her champion, and yet he felt that that position\nwould be almost forced upon him. He foresaw danger,--and consequently\nhe was doubting about his journey to Scotland.\n\n\"I hardly know whether I am or not,\" said Frank,--and he almost felt\nthat he was blushing.\n\n\"I hope you are,\" said Lucy. \"When a man has to work all day and\nnearly all night he should go where he may get fresh air.\"\n\n\"There's very good air without going to Scotland for it,\" said Lady\nFawn, who kept up an excellent house at Richmond, but who, with all\nher daughters, could not afford autumn trips. The Fawns lived at Fawn\nCourt all the year round, and consequently Lady Fawn thought that\nair was to be found in England sufficiently good for all purposes of\nvitality and recreation.\n\n\"It's not quite the same thing,\" said Lucy;--\"at least, not for a\nman.\"\n\nAfter that she was allowed to escape into the grounds with her lover,\nand was made happy with half-an-hour of unalloyed bliss. To be alone\nwith the girl to whom he is not engaged is a man's delight;--to be\nalone with the man to whom she is engaged is the woman's. When the\nthing is settled there is always present to the man something of a\nfeeling of clipped wings; whereas the woman is conscious of a new\npower of expanding her pinions. The certainty of the thing is to him\nrepressive. He has done his work, and gained his victory,--and by\nconquering has become a slave. To her the certainty of the thing is\nthe removal of a restraint which has hitherto always been on her.\nShe can tell him everything, and be told everything,--whereas her\nprevious confidences, made with those of her own sex, have been\ntame, and by comparison valueless. He has no new confidence to\nmake,--unless when he comes to tell her he likes his meat well done,\nand wants his breakfast to be punctual. Lucy now not only promised\nherself, but did actually realise a great joy. He seemed to her all\nthat her heart desired. He was a man whose manner was naturally\ncaressing and demonstrative, and she was to him, of all women, the\nsweetest, the dearest, the most perfect,--and all his own. \"But,\nFrank,\"--she had already been taught to call him Frank when they were\nalone together,--\"what will come of all this about Lizzie Eustace?\"\n\n\"They will be married,--of course.\"\n\n\"Do you think so? I am sure Lady Fawn doesn't think so.\"\n\n\"What Lady Fawn thinks on such a matter cannot be helped. When a man\nasks a woman to marry him, and she accepts, the natural consequence\nis that they will be married. Don't you think so?\"\n\n\"I hope so,--sometimes,\" said Lucy, with her two hands joined upon\nhis arm, and hanging to it with all her little weight.\n\n\"You really do hope it?\" he said.\n\n\"Oh, I do; you know I do. Hope it! I should die if I didn't hope it.\"\n\n\"Then why shouldn't she?\" He asked his question with a quick, sharp\nvoice, and then turned upon her for an answer.\n\n\"I don't know,\" she said, very softly, and still clinging to him. \"I\nsometimes think there is a difference in people.\"\n\n\"There is a difference; but, still, we hardly judge of people\nsufficiently by our own feelings. As she accepted him, you may be\nsure that she wishes to marry him. She has more to give than he has.\"\n\n\"And I have nothing to give,\" she said.\n\n\"If I thought so, I'd go back even now,\" he answered. \"It is because\nyou have so much to give,--so much more than most others,--that I\nhave thought of you, dreamed of you as my wife, almost ever since I\nfirst knew you.\"\n\n\"I have nothing left to give,\" she said. \"What I ever had is all\ngiven. People call it the heart. I think it is heart, and brain, and\nmind, and body,--and almost soul. But, Frank, though Lizzie Eustace\nis your cousin, I don't want to be likened to her. She is very\nclever, and beautiful,--and has a way with her that I know is\ncharming;--but--\"\n\n\"But what, Lucy?\"\n\n\"I don't think she cares so much as some people. I dare say she likes\nLord Fawn very well, but I do not believe she loves him as I love\nyou.\"\n\n\"They're engaged,\" said Frank, \"and the best thing they can do is to\nmarry each other. I can tell you this, at any rate,\"--and his manner\nagain became serious,--\"if Lord Fawn behaves ill to her, I, as her\ncousin, shall take her part.\"\n\n\"You don't mean that you'll--fight him!\"\n\n\"No, my darling. Men don't fight each other now-a-days;--not often,\nat least, and Fawn and I are not of the fighting sort. I can make him\nunderstand what I mean and what others will mean without fighting\nhim. He is making a paltry excuse.\"\n\n\"But why should he want to excuse himself--without reason?\"\n\n\"Because he is afraid. People have got hold of him and told him lies,\nand he thinks there will be a scrape about this necklace, and he\nhates a scrape. He'll marry her at last, without a doubt, and Lady\nFawn is only making trouble for herself by trying to prevent it. You\ncan't do anything.\"\n\n\"Oh no;--I can't do anything. When she was here it became at last\nquite disagreeable. She hardly spoke to them, and I'm sure that even\nthe servants understood that there was a quarrel.\" She did not say a\nword of Lizzie's offer of the brooch to herself, nor of the stories\nwhich by degrees were reaching her ears as to the old debts, and the\ndiamonds, and the young bride's conduct to Lady Linlithgow as soon as\nshe married her grand husband, Sir Florian. She did think badly of\nLizzie, and could not but regret that her own noble, generous Frank\nshould have to expend his time and labour on a friend unworthy of his\nfriendship; but there was no shade of jealousy in her feeling, and\nshe uttered no word against Lizzie more bitter than that in which she\ndeclared that there was a difference between people.\n\nAnd then there was something said as to their own prospects in life.\nLucy at once and with vehemence declared that she did not look for or\nexpect an immediate marriage. She did not scruple to tell him that\nshe knew well how difficult was the task before him, and that it\nmight be essential for his interest that he should remain as he was\nfor a year or two. He was astonished to find how completely she\nunderstood his position, and how thoroughly she sympathised with his\ninterests. \"There is only one thing I couldn't do for you,\" she said.\n\n\"And what is the one thing?\"\n\n\"I couldn't give you up. I almost thought that I ought to refuse you\nbecause I can do nothing,--nothing to help you. But there will always\ncome a limit to self-denial. I couldn't do that! Could I?\"\n\nThe reader will know how this question was answered, and will not\nwant to be told of the long, close, clinging, praiseworthy kiss with\nwhich the young barrister assured her that would have been on her\npart an act of self-denial which would to him have been absolutely\nruinous. It was agreed, however, between them, that Lady Fawn should\nbe told that they did not propose to marry till some time in the\nfollowing year, and that she should be formally asked to allow Lucy\nto have a home at Fawn Court in the interval.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\n\"As My Brother\"\n\n\nLord Fawn had promised, as he put Lizzie into her carriage, that he\nwould come to her soon,--but he did not come soon. A fortnight passed\nand he did not show himself. Nothing further had been done in the\nmatter of the diamonds, except that Mr. Camperdown had written to\nFrank Greystock, explaining how impossible it was that the question\nof their possession should be referred to arbitration. According to\nhim they belonged to the heir, as did the estate; and no one would\nhave the power of accepting an arbitration respecting them,--an\narbitration which might separate them from the estate of which an\ninfant was the owner for his life,--any more than such arbitration\ncould be accepted as to the property of the estate itself.\n\"Possession is nine points of the law,\" said Frank to himself, as\nhe put the letter aside,--thinking at the same time that possession\nin the hands of Lizzie Eustace included certainly every one of\nthose nine points. Lizzie wore her diamonds again and then again.\nThere may be a question whether the possession of the necklace and\nthe publicity of their history,--which, however, like many other\nhistories, was most inaccurately told,--did not add something to her\nreputation as a lady of fashion. In the meantime, Lord Fawn did not\ncome to see her. So she wrote to him. \"My dear Frederic, had you not\nbetter come to me? Yours affectionately,--L. I go to the North at the\nend of this month.\"\n\nBut Frank Greystock did visit her,--more than once. On the day\nafter the above letter was written he came to her. It was on Sunday\nafternoon, when July was more than half over, and he found her alone.\nMiss Macnulty had gone to church, and Lizzie was lying listlessly on\na sofa with a volume of poetry in her hand. She had in truth been\nreading the book, and in her way enjoying it. It told her the story\nof certain knights of old, who had gone forth in quest of a sign from\nheaven, which sign, if verily seen by them, might be taken to signify\nthat they themselves were esteemed holy, and fit for heavenly joy.\nOne would have thought that no theme could have been less palatable\nto such a one as Lizzie Eustace; but the melody of the lines had\npleased her ear, and she was always able to arouse for herself a\nfalse enthusiasm on things which were utterly outside herself in\nlife. She thought she too could have travelled in search of that holy\nsign, and have borne all things, and abandoned all things, and have\npersevered,--and of a certainty have been rewarded. But as for giving\nup a string of diamonds, in common honesty,--that was beyond her.\n\n\"I wonder whether men ever were like that?\" she said, as she allowed\nher cousin to take the book from her hands.\n\n\"Let us hope not.\"\n\n\"Oh, Frank!\"\n\n\"They were, no doubt, as fanatic and foolish as you please. If you\nwill read to the end--\"\n\n\"I have read it all,--every word of it,\" said Lizzie,\nenthusiastically.\n\n\"Then you know that Arthur did not go on the search, because he had a\njob of work to do, by the doing of which the people around him might\nperhaps be somewhat benefited.\"\n\n\"I like Launcelot better than Arthur,\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"So did the Queen,\" replied Frank.\n\n\"Your useful, practical man, who attends vestries, and sits at\nBoards, and measures out his gifts to others by the ounce, never has\nany heart. Has he, Frank?\"\n\n\"I don't know what heart means. I sometimes fancy that it is a talent\nfor getting into debt, and running away with other men's wives.\"\n\n\"You say that on purpose to make me quarrel with you. You don't run\naway with other men's wives, and you have heart.\"\n\n\"But I get into debt, unfortunately; and as for other men's wives, I\nam not sure that I may not do even that some day. Has Lord Fawn been\nhere?\" She shook her head. \"Or written?\" Again she shook her head.\nAs she did so the long curl waved and was very near to him, for he\nwas sitting close to the sofa, and she had raised herself so that\nshe might look into his face and speak to him almost in a whisper.\n\"Something should be settled, Lizzie, before you leave town.\"\n\n\"I wrote to him, yesterday,--one line, and desired him to come. I\nexpected him here to-day, but you have come instead. Shall I say that\nI am disappointed?\"\n\n\"No doubt you are so.\"\n\n\"Oh, Frank, how vain you men are! You want me to swear to you that\nI would sooner have you with me than him. You are not content\nwith--thinking it, unless I tell you that it is so. You know that\nit is so. Though he is to be my husband,--I suppose he will be my\nhusband,--his spirit is not congenial to mine, as is yours.\"\n\n\"Had you not loved him you would not have accepted him.\"\n\n\"What was I to do, Frank? What am I to do? Think how desolate I\nam, how unfriended, how much in want of some one whom I can call\na protector! I cannot have you always with me. You care more for\nthe little finger of that prim piece of propriety down at the old\ndowager's than you do for me and all my sorrows.\" This was true,\nbut Frank did not say that it was true. \"Lord Fawn is at any rate\nrespectable. At least, I thought he was so when I accepted his\noffer.\"\n\n\"He is respectable enough.\"\n\n\"Just that;--isn't it?--and nothing more. You do not blame me for\nsaying that I would be his wife? If you do, I will unsay it, let\nit cost me what it may. He is treating me so badly that I need not\ngo far for an excuse.\" Then she looked into his face with all the\neagerness of her gaze, clearly implying that she expected a serious\nanswer. \"Why do you not answer me, Frank?\"\n\n\"What am I to say? He is a timid, cautious man. They have frightened\nhim about this trumpery necklace, and he is behaving badly. But he\nwill make a good husband. He is not a spendthrift. He has rank. All\nhis people are respectable. As Lady Fawn, any house in England will\nbe open to you. He is not rich, but together you will be rich.\"\n\n\"What is all that without love?\"\n\n\"I do not doubt his love. And when you are his own he will love you\ndearly.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes;--as he would a horse or a picture. Is there anything of the\nrapture of love in that? Is that your idea of love? Is it so you love\nyour Miss Demure?\"\n\n\"Don't call names, Lizzie.\"\n\n\"I shall say what I please of her. You and I are to be friends, and I\nmay not speak? No;--I will have no such friendship! She is demure. If\nyou like it, what harm is there in my saying it? I am not demure. I\nknow that. I do not, at least, pretend to be other than I am. When\nshe becomes your wife, I wonder whether you will like her ways?\" He\nhad not yet told her that she was to be his wife, nor did he so tell\nher now. He thought for a moment that he had better tell her, but he\ndid not do so. It would, he said to himself, add an embarrassment\nto his present position. And as the marriage was to be postponed\nfor a year, it might be better, perhaps, for Lucy that it should\nnot be declared openly. It was thus he argued with himself, but yet,\nno doubt, he knew well that he did not declare the truth because it\nwould take away something of its sweetness from this friendship with\nhis cousin Lizzie.\n\n\"If ever I do marry,\" he said, \"I hope I shall like my wife's ways.\"\n\n\"Of course you will not tell me anything. I do not expect confidence\nfrom you. I do not think a man is ever able to work himself up to\nthe mark of true confidence with his friend. Men together, when they\nlike each other, talk of politics, or perhaps of money; but I doubt\nwhether they ever really tell their thoughts and longings to each\nother.\"\n\n\"Are women more communicative?\"\n\n\"Yes;--certainly. What is there that I would not tell you if you\ncared to hear it? Every thought I have is open to you if you choose\nto read it. I have that feeling regarding you that I would keep\nnothing back from you. Oh, Frank, if you understood me, you could\nsave me,--I was going to say--from all unhappiness.\"\n\nShe did it so well that he would have been more than man had he not\nbelieved some of it. She was sitting almost upright now, though her\nfeet were still on the sofa, and was leaning over towards him, as\nthough imploring him for his aid, and her eyes were full of tears,\nand her lips were apart as though still eager with the energy of\nexpression, and her hands were clasped together. She was very lovely,\nvery attractive, almost invincible. For such a one as Frank Greystock\nopposition to her in her present mood was impossible. There are men\nby whom a woman, if she have wit, beauty, and no conscience, cannot\nbe withstood. Arms may be used against them, and a sort of battle\nwaged, against which they can raise no shield,--from which they can\nretire into no fortress,--in which they can parry no blow. A man so\nweak and so attacked may sometimes run; but even the poor chance of\nrunning is often cut off from him. How unlike she was to Lucy! He\nbelieved her,--in part; and yet that was the idea that occurred to\nhim. When Lucy was much in earnest, in her eye, too, a tear would\nsparkle, the smallest drop, a bright liquid diamond that never fell;\nand all her face would be bright and eloquent with feeling;--but how\nunlike were the two! He knew that the difference was that between\ntruth and falsehood;--and yet he partly believed the falsehood! \"If I\nknew how to save you from an hour's uneasiness, I would do it,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"No;--no;--no;\" she murmured.\n\n\"Would I not? You do not know me then.\" He had nothing further to\nsay, and it suited her to remain silent for the moment, while she\ndried her eyes, and recovered her composure, and prepared herself\nto carry on the battle with a smile. She would carry on the battle,\nusing every wile she knew, straining every nerve to be victorious,\nencountering any and all dangers, and yet she had no definite aim\nbefore her. She herself did not know what she would be at. At this\nperiod of her career she did not want to marry her cousin,--having\nresolved that she would be Lady Fawn. Nor did she intend that her\ncousin should be her lover,--in the ordinary sense of love. She was\nfar too wary in the pursuit of the world's goods to sacrifice herself\nto any such wish as that. She did want him to help her about the\ndiamonds,--but such help as that she might have, as she knew well,\non much easier terms. There was probably an anxiety in her bosom to\ncause him to be untrue to Lucy Morris; but the guiding motive of her\nconduct was the desire to make things seem to be other than they\nwere. To be always acting a part rather than living her own life was\nto her everything. \"After all we must come to facts,\" he said, after\na while. \"I suppose it will be better that you should marry Lord\nFawn.\"\n\n\"If you wish it.\"\n\n\"Nay;--I cannot have that said. In this matter you must rule yourself\nby your own judgment. If you are averse to it--\" She shook her head.\n\"Then you will own that it had better be so.\" Again she shook her\nhead. \"Lizzie, for your sake and my own, I must declare, that if you\nhave no opinion in this matter, neither will I have any. You shall\nnever have to say that I pressed you into this marriage or debarred\nyou from marrying. I could not bear such an accusation.\"\n\n\"But you might tell me what I ought to do.\"\n\n\"No;--certainly not.\"\n\n\"Think how young I am, and,--by comparison,--how old you are. You\nare eight years older than I am. Remember;--after all that I have\ngone through, I am but twenty-two. At my age other girls have their\nfriends to tell them. I have no one,--unless you will tell me.\"\n\n\"You have accepted him?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I suppose he is not altogether indifferent to you?\"\n\nShe paused, and again shook her head. \"Indeed, I do not know. If you\nmean, do I love him, as I could love some man whose heart was quite\ncongenial to my own, certainly I do not.\" She continued to shake her\nhead very sadly. \"I esteemed him,--when he asked me.\"\n\n\"Say at once that, having made up your mind, you will go through with\nit.\"\n\n\"You think that I ought?\"\n\n\"You think so,--yourself.\"\n\n\"So be it, Frank. I will. But, Frank, I will not give up my property.\nYou do not wish me to do that. It would be weak, now;--would it not?\nI am sure that it is my own.\"\n\n\"His faith to you should not depend on that.\"\n\n\"No, of course not; that is just what I mean. He can have no right\nto interfere. When he asked me to be his wife, he said nothing about\nthat. But if he does not come to me, what shall I do?\"\n\n\"I suppose I had better see him,\" said Frank slowly.\n\n\"Will you? That will be so good of you. I feel that I can leave it\nall so safely in your hands. I shall go out of town, you know, on the\nthirtieth. I feel that I shall be better away, and I am sick of all\nthe noise, and glitter, and worldliness of London. You will come on\nthe twelfth?\"\n\n\"Not quite so soon as that,\" he said, after a pause.\n\n\"But you will come?\"\n\n\"Yes;--about the twentieth.\"\n\n\"And, of course, I shall see you?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes.\"\n\n\"So that I may have some one to guide me that I can trust. I have\nno brother, Frank; do you ever think of that?\" She put out her hand\nto him, and he clasped it, and held it tight in his own; and then,\nafter a while, he pulled her towards him. In a moment she was on the\nground, kneeling at his feet, and his arm was round her shoulder,\nand his hand was on her back, and he was embracing her. Her face was\nturned up to him, and he pressed his lips upon her forehead. \"As my\nbrother,\" she said, stretching back her head and looking up into his\nface.\n\n\"Yes;--as your brother.\"\n\nThey were sitting, or rather acting their little play together, in\nthe back drawing-room, and the ordinary entrance to the two rooms\nwas from the landing-place into the larger apartment;--of which fact\nLizzie was probably aware, when she permitted herself to fall into a\nposition as to which a moment or two might be wanted for recovery.\nWhen, therefore, the servant in livery opened the door, which he did,\nas Frank thought somewhat suddenly, she was able to be standing on\nher legs before she was caught. The quickness with which she sprung\nfrom her position, and the facility with which she composed not her\nface only, but the loose lock of her hair and all her person, for\nthe reception of the coming visitor, was quite marvellous. About her\nthere was none of the look of having been found out, which is so very\ndisagreeable to the wearer of it; whereas Frank, when Lord Fawn was\nannounced, was aware that his manner was awkward, and his general\nappearance flurried. Lizzie was no more flurried than if she had\nstepped that moment from out of the hands of her tirewoman. She\ngreeted Lord Fawn very prettily, holding him by the hand long enough\nto show that she had more claim to do so than could any other woman,\nand then she just murmured her cousin's name. The two men shook\nhands--and looked at each other as men do who know that they are\nnot friends, and think that they may live to be enemies. Lord Fawn,\nwho rarely forgot anything, had certainly not forgotten the Sawab;\nand Frank was aware that he might soon be called on to address his\nlordship in anything but friendly terms. They said, however, a few\nwords about Parliament and the weather, and the desirability of\nescaping from London.\n\n\"Frank,\" said Lady Eustace, \"is coming down in August to shoot my\nthree annual grouse at Portray. He would keep one for you, my lord,\nif he thought you would come for it.\"\n\n\"I'll promise Lord Fawn a fair third, at any rate,\" said Frank.\n\n\"I cannot visit Portray this August, I'm afraid,\" said his lordship,\n\"much as I might wish to do so. One of us must remain at the India\nOffice--\"\n\n\"Oh, that weary India Office!\" exclaimed Lizzie.\n\n\"I almost think you official men are worse off than we barristers,\"\nsaid Frank. \"Well, Lizzie, good-bye. I dare say I shall see you again\nbefore you start.\"\n\n\"Of course you will,\" said Lizzie. And then the two lovers were left\ntogether. They had met once, at Lady Glencora's ball, since the\nquarrel at Fawn Court, and there, as though by mutual forbearance,\nhad not alluded to their troubles. Now he had come, especially to\nspeak of the matter that concerned them both so deeply. As long as\nFrank Greystock was in the room, his work was comparatively easy,\nbut he had known beforehand that he would not find it at all easy\nshould he be left alone with her. Lizzie began. \"My lord,\" she said,\n\"considering all that has passed between us, you have been a truant.\"\n\n\"Yes;--I admit it--but--\"\n\n\"With me, my lord, a fault admitted is a fault forgiven.\" Then she\ntook her old seat on the sofa, and he placed himself on the chair\nwhich Frank Greystock had occupied. He had not intended to own a\nfault, and certainly not to accept forgiveness; but she had been too\nquick for him; and now he could not find words by which to express\nhimself. \"In truth,\" she continued, \"I would always rather remember\none kindness than a dozen omissions on the part of a friend.\"\n\n\"Lady Eustace, I have not willingly omitted anything.\"\n\n\"So be it. I will not give you the slightest excuse for saying that\nyou have heard a reproach from me. You have come at last, and you are\nwelcome. Is that enough for you?\"\n\nHe had much to say to her about the diamonds, and, when he was\nentering the room, he had not a word to say to her about anything\nelse. Since that, another subject had sprung up before him. Whether\nhe was, or was not, to regard himself as being at this moment engaged\nto marry Lady Eustace, was a matter to him of much doubt;--but of\nthis he was sure, that if she were engaged to him as his wife, she\nought not to be entertaining her cousin Frank Greystock down at\nPortray Castle, unless she had some old lady, not only respectable in\nlife, but high in rank also, to see that everything was right. It was\nalmost an insult to him that such a visit should have been arranged\nwithout his sanction or cognizance. Of course, if he were bound by no\nengagement,--and he had been persuaded by his mother and sister to\nwish that he were not bound,--then the matter would be no affair of\nhis. If, however, the diamonds were abandoned, then the engagement\nwas to be continued;--and in that case it was out of the question\nthat his elected bride should entertain another young man,--even\nthough she was a widow and the young man was her cousin. Of course,\nhe should have spoken of the diamonds first; but the other matter had\nobtruded itself upon him, and he was puzzled. \"Is Mr. Greystock to\naccompany you into Scotland?\" he asked.\n\n\"Oh dear no. I go on the thirtieth of this month. I hardly know when\nhe means to be there.\"\n\n\"He follows you to Portray?\n\n\"Yes;--he follows me, of course. 'The king himself has followed her,\nWhen she has gone before.'\" Lord Fawn did not remember the quotation,\nand was more puzzled than ever. \"Frank will follow me, just as the\nother shooting men will follow me.\"\n\n\"He goes direct to Portray Castle?\"\n\n\"Neither directly nor indirectly. Just at present, Lord Fawn, I am in\nno mood to entertain guests,--not even one that I love so well as my\ncousin Frank. The Portray mountains are somewhat extensive, and at\nthe back of them there is a little shooting-lodge.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed,\" said Lord Fawn, feeling that he had better dash at once\nat the diamonds.\n\n\"If you, my lord, could manage to join us for a day, my cousin and\nhis friend would, I am sure, come over to the castle, so that you\nshould not suffer from being left alone with me and Miss Macnulty.\"\n\n\"At present it is impossible,\" said Lord Fawn;--and then he paused.\n\"Lady Eustace, the position in which you and I stand to each other is\none not altogether free from trouble.\"\n\n\"You cannot say that it is of my making,\" she said, with a smile.\n\"You once asked--what men think a favour from me; and I granted\nit,--perhaps too easily.\"\n\n\"I know how greatly I am indebted to your goodness, Lady Eustace--\"\nAnd then again he paused.\n\n\"Lord Fawn!\"\n\n\"I trust you will believe that nothing can be further from me than\nthat you should be harassed by any conduct of mine.\"\n\n\"I am harassed, my lord.\"\n\n\"And so am I. I have learned that you are in possession of certain\njewels which I cannot allow to be held by my wife.\"\n\n\"I am not your wife, Lord Fawn.\" As she said this, she rose from her\nreclining posture and sat erect.\n\n\"That is true. You are not. But you said you would be.\"\n\n\"Go on, sir.\"\n\n\"It was the pride of my life to think that I had attained to so much\nhappiness. Then came this matter of the diamonds.\"\n\n\"What business have you with my diamonds,--more than any other man?\"\n\n\"Simply that I am told that they are not yours.\"\n\n\"Who tells you so?\"\n\n\"Various people. Mr. Camperdown.\"\n\n\"If you, my lord, intend to take an attorney's word against mine, and\nthat on a matter as to which no one but myself can know the truth,\nthen you are not fit to be my husband. The diamonds are my own, and\nshould you and I become man and wife, they must remain so by special\nsettlement. While I choose to keep them they will be mine,--to do\nwith them as I please. It will be my pleasure, when my boy marries,\nto hang them round his bride's neck.\" She carried herself well, and\nspoke her words with dignity.\n\n\"What I have got to say is this,\" began Lord Fawn;--\"I must consider\nour engagement as at an end unless you will give them up to Mr.\nCamperdown.\"\n\n\"I will not give them up to Mr. Camperdown.\"\n\n\"Then,--then,--then,--\"\n\n\"And I make bold to tell you, Lord Fawn, that you are not behaving to\nme like a man of honour. I shall now leave the matter in the hands of\nmy cousin, Mr. Greystock.\" Then she sailed out of the room, and Lord\nFawn was driven to escape from the house as he might. He stood about\nthe room for five minutes with his hat in his hand, and then walked\ndown and let himself out of the front door.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nThe Diamonds Become Troublesome\n\n\nThe thirtieth of July came round, and Lizzie was prepared for her\njourney down to Scotland. She was to be accompanied by Miss Macnulty\nand her own maid and her own servants, and to travel, of course, like\na grand lady. She had not seen Lord Fawn since the meeting recorded\nin the last chapter, but had seen her cousin Frank nearly every other\nday. He, after much consideration, had written a long letter to Lord\nFawn, in which he had given that nobleman to understand that some\nexplanation was required as to conduct which Frank described as being\nto him \"at present unintelligible.\" He then went, at considerable\nlength, into the matter of the diamonds, with the object of proving\nthat Lord Fawn could have no possible right to interfere in the\nmatter. And though he had from the first wished that Lizzie would\ngive up the trinket, he made various points in her favour. Not only\nhad they been given to his cousin by her late husband,--but even\nhad they not been so given, they would have been hers by will. Sir\nFlorian had left her everything that was within the walls of Portray\nCastle, and the diamonds had been at Portray at the time of Sir\nFlorian's death. Such was Frank's statement,--untrue indeed, but\nbelieved by him to be true. This was one of Lizzie's lies, forged as\nsoon as she understood that some subsidiary claim might be made upon\nthem on the ground that they formed a portion of property left by\nwill away from her;--some claim subsidiary to the grand claim, that\nthe necklace was a family heirloom. Lord Fawn was not in the least\nshaken in his conviction that Lizzie had behaved, and was behaving,\nbadly, and that, therefore, he had better get rid of her; but he knew\nthat he must be very wary in the reasons he would give for jilting\nher. He wrote, therefore, a very short note to Greystock, promising\nthat any explanation needed should be given as soon as circumstances\nshould admit of his forming a decision. In the meantime, the 30th of\nJuly came, and Lady Eustace was ready for her journey.\n\nThere is, or there was, a train leaving London for Carlisle at 11\na.m., by which Lizzie proposed to travel, so that she might sleep\nin that city and go on through Dumfries to Portray the next morning.\nThis was her scheme; but there was another part of her scheme as to\nwhich she had felt much doubt. Should she leave the diamonds, or\nshould she take them with her? The iron box in which they were kept\nwas small, and so far portable that a strong man might carry it\nwithout much trouble. Indeed, Lizzie could move it from one part of\nthe room to the other, and she had often done so. But it was so heavy\nthat it could not be taken with her without attracting attention. The\nservant would know what it was, and the porter would know, and Miss\nMacnulty would know. That her own maid should know was a matter of\ncourse; but even to her own maid the journey of the jewels would be\nremarkable because of the weight of the box, whereas if they went\nwith her other jewels in her dressing-case, there would be nothing\nremarkable. She might even have taken them in her pocket,--had\nshe dared. But she did not dare. Though she was intelligent and\ncourageous, she was wonderfully ignorant as to what might and what\nmight not be done for the recovery of the necklace by Mr. Camperdown.\nShe did not dare to take them without the iron box, and at last\nshe decided that the box should go. At a little after ten, her own\ncarriage,--the job-carriage, which was now about to perform its last\njourney in her service,--was at the door, and a cab was there for the\nservants. The luggage was brought down, and with the larger boxes\nwas brought the iron case with the necklace. The servant, certainly\nmaking more of the weight than he need have done, deposited it as a\nfoot-stool for Lizzie, who then seated herself, and was followed by\nMiss Macnulty. She would have it placed in the same way beneath her\nfeet in the railway carriage, and again brought into her room at the\nCarlisle hotel. What though the porter did know! There was nothing\nillegal in travelling about with a heavy iron box full of diamonds,\nand the risk would be less this way, she thought, than were she to\nleave them behind her in London. The house in Mount Street, which\nshe had taken for the season, was to be given up; and whom could she\ntrust in London? Her very bankers, she feared, would have betrayed\nher, and given up her treasure to Mr. Camperdown. As for Messrs.\nHarter and Benjamin, she felt sure that they would be bribed by Mr.\nCamperdown. She once thought of asking her cousin to take the charge\nof them, but she could not bring herself to let them out of her own\nhands. Ten thousand pounds! If she could only sell them and get\nthe money, from what a world of trouble would she be relieved. And\nthe sale, for another reason, would have been convenient; for Lady\nEustace was already a little in debt. But she could not sell them,\nand therefore when she got into the carriage there was the box under\nher feet.\n\nAt that very moment who should appear on the pavement, standing\nbetween the carriage and the house-door, but Mr. Camperdown! And with\nMr. Camperdown there was another man,--a very suspicious-looking\nman,--whom Lizzie at once took to be a detective officer of police.\n\"Lady Eustace!\" said Mr. Camperdown, taking off his hat. Lizzie bowed\nacross Miss Macnulty, and endeavoured to restrain the tell-tale blood\nfrom flying to her cheeks. \"I believe,\" said Mr. Camperdown, \"that\nyou are now starting for Scotland.\"\n\n\"We are, Mr. Camperdown;--and we are very late.\"\n\n\"Could you allow me two minutes' conversation with you in the house?\"\n\n\"Oh dear, no. We are late, I tell you. What a time you have chosen\nfor coming, Mr. Camperdown!\"\n\n\"It is an awkward hour, Lady Eustace. I only heard this morning that\nyou were going so soon, and it is imperative that I should see you.\"\n\n\"Had you not better write, Mr. Camperdown?\"\n\n\"You will never answer my letters, madam.\"\n\n\"I--I--I really cannot see you now. William, the coachman must drive\non. We cannot allow ourselves to lose the train. I am really very\nsorry, Mr. Camperdown, but we must not lose the train.\"\n\n\"Lady Eustace,\" said Mr. Camperdown, putting his hand on the\ncarriage-door, and so demeaning himself that the coachman did\nnot dare to drive on, \"I must ask you a question.\" He spoke in a\nlow voice, but he was speaking across Miss Macnulty. That lady,\ntherefore, heard him, and so did William, the servant, who was\nstanding close to the door. \"I must insist on knowing where are the\nEustace diamonds.\" Lizzie felt the box beneath her feet, and, without\nshowing that she did so, somewhat widened her drapery.\n\n\"I can tell you nothing now. William, make the coachman drive on.\"\n\n\"If you will not answer me, I must tell you that I shall be driven in\nthe execution of my duty to obtain a search-warrant, in order that\nthey may be placed in proper custody. They are not your property, and\nmust be taken out of your hands.\"\n\nLizzie looked at the suspicious man with a frightened gaze. The\nsuspicious man was, in fact, a very respectable clerk in Mr.\nCamperdown's employment, but Lizzie for a moment felt that the search\nwas about to begin at once. She had hardly understood the threat, and\nthought that the attorney was already armed with the powers of which\nhe spoke. She glanced for a moment at Miss Macnulty, and then at the\nservant. Would they betray her? If they chose to use force to her,\nthe box certainly might be taken from her. \"I know I shall lose the\ntrain,\" she said. \"I know I shall. I must insist that you let my\nservant drive on.\" There was now a little crowd of a dozen persons\non the pavement, and there was nothing to cover her diamonds but the\nskirt of her travelling-dress.\n\n\"Are they in this house, Lady Eustace?\"\n\n\"Why doesn't he go on?\" shouted Lizzie. \"You have no right, sir, to\nstop me. I won't be stopped.\"\n\n\"Or have you got them with you?\"\n\n\"I shall answer no questions. You have no right to treat me in this\nway.\"\n\n\"Then I shall be forced, on behalf of the family, to obtain a\nsearch-warrant, both here and in Ayrshire, and proceedings will\nbe taken also against your ladyship personally.\" So saying, Mr.\nCamperdown withdrew, and at last the carriage was driven on.\n\nAs it happened, there was time enough for catching the train,--and\nto spare. The whole affair in Mount Street had taken less than ten\nminutes. But the effect upon Lizzie was very severe. For a while she\ncould not speak, and at last she burst out into hysteric tears,--not\na sham fit,--but a true convulsive agony of sobbing. All the world of\nMount Street, including her own servants, had heard the accusation\nagainst her. During the whole morning she had been wishing that she\nhad never seen the diamonds; but now it was almost impossible that\nshe should part with them. And yet they were like a load upon her\nchest, a load as heavy as though she were compelled to sit with the\niron box on her lap day and night. In her sobbing she felt the thing\nunder her feet, and knew that she could not get rid of it. She hated\nthe box, and yet she must cling to it now. She was thoroughly ashamed\nof the box, and yet she must seem to take a pride in it. She was\nhorribly afraid of the box, and yet she must keep it in her own\nvery bed-room. And what should she say about the box now to Miss\nMacnulty, who sat by her side, stiff and scornful, offering her\nsmelling-bottles, but not offering her sympathy? \"My dear,\" she said\nat last, \"that horrid man has quite upset me.\"\n\n\"I don't wonder that you should be upset,\" said Miss Macnulty.\n\n\"And so unjust, too,--so false,--so--so--so--. They are my own as\nmuch as that umbrella is yours, Miss Macnulty.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Miss Macnulty.\n\n\"But I tell you,\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"What I mean is, that it is such a pity there should be a doubt.\"\n\n\"There is no doubt,\" said Lizzie;--\"how dare you say there is a\ndoubt? My cousin, Mr. Greystock, says that there is not the slightest\ndoubt. He is a barrister, and must know better than an attorney like\nthat Mr. Camperdown.\" By this time they were at the Euston Square\nstation, and then there was more trouble with the box. The footman\nstruggled with it into the waiting-room, and the porter struggled\nwith it from the waiting-room to the carriage. Lizzie could not but\nlook at the porter as he carried it, and she felt sure that the man\nhad been told of its contents and was struggling with the express\nview of adding to her annoyance. The same thing happened at Carlisle,\nwhere the box was carried up into Lizzie's bedroom by the footman,\nand where she was convinced that her treasure had become the subject\nof conversation for the whole house. In the morning people looked\nat her as she walked down the long platform with the box still\nstruggling before her. She almost wished that she had undertaken its\ncarriage herself, as she thought that even she could have managed\nwith less outward show of effort. Her own servants seemed to be\nin league against her, and Miss Macnulty had never before been so\ngenerally unpleasant. Poor Miss Macnulty, who had a conscientious\nidea of doing her duty, and who always attempted to give an adequate\nreturn for the bread she ate, could not so far overcome the effect of\nMr. Camperdown's visit as to speak on any subject without being stiff\nand hard. And she suffered, too, from the box,--to such a degree that\nshe turned over in her mind the thought of leaving Lizzie, if any\nother possible home might be found for her. Who would willingly live\nwith a woman who always travelled about with a diamond necklace worth\nten thousand pounds, locked up in an iron safe,--and that necklace\nnot her own property.\n\nBut at last Lady Eustace, and Miss Macnulty, and the servants,--and\nthe iron box,--reached Portray Castle in safety.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\n\"Ianthe's Soul\"\n\n\nLady Eustace had been rather cross on the journey down to Scotland,\nand had almost driven the unfortunate Macnulty to think that Lady\nLinlithgow or the workhouse would be better than this young tyrant;\nbut on her arrival at her own house she was for awhile all smiles and\nkindness. During the journey she had been angry without thought, but\nwas almost entitled to be excused for her anger. Could Miss Macnulty\nhave realised the amount of oppression inflicted on her patroness by\nthe box of diamonds she would have forgiven anything. Hitherto there\nhad been some secrecy, or at any rate some privacy attached to the\nmatter; but now that odious lawyer had discussed the matter aloud, in\nthe very streets, in the presence of the servants, and Lady Eustace\nhad felt that it was discussed also by every porter on the railway\nfrom London down to Troon, the station in Scotland at which her own\ncarriage met her to take her to her own castle. The night at Carlisle\nhad been terrible to her, and the diamonds had never been for a\nmoment off her mind. Perhaps the worst of it all was that her own\nman-servant and maid-servant had heard the claim which had been so\nviolently made by Mr. Camperdown. There are people, in that respect\nvery fortunately circumstanced, whose servants, as a matter of\ncourse, know all their affairs, have an interest in their concerns,\nsympathise with their demands, feel their wants, and are absolutely\nat one with them. But in such cases the servants are really known,\nand are almost as completely a part of the family as the sons and\ndaughters. There may be disruptions and quarrels; causes may arise\nfor ending the existing condition of things; but while this condition\nlasts, the servants in such households are, for the most part, only\ntoo well inclined to fight the battles of their employers. Mr. Binns,\nthe butler, would almost foam at the mouth if it were suggested to\nhim that the plate at Silvercup Hall was not the undoubted property\nof the old squire; and Mrs. Pouncebox could not be made to believe,\nby any amount of human evidence, that the jewels which her lady has\nworn for the last fifteen years are not her ladyship's very own.\nBinns would fight for the plate, and so would Pouncebox for the\njewels, almost till they were cut to pieces. The preservation of\nthese treasures on behalf of those who paid them their wages and fed\nthem, who occasionally scolded them, but always succoured them, would\nbe their point of honour. No torture would get the key of the cellar\nfrom Binns; no threats extract from Pouncebox a secret of the toilet.\nBut poor Lizzie Eustace had no Binns and no Pouncebox. They are\nplants that grow slowly. There was still too much of the mushroom\nabout Lady Eustace to permit of her possessing such treasures. Her\nfootman was six feet high, was not bad looking, and was called\nThomas. She knew no more about him, and was far too wise to expect\nsympathy from him, or other aid than the work for which she paid\nhim. Her own maid was somewhat nearer to her; but not much nearer.\nThe girl's name was Patience Crabstick, and she could do hair well.\nLizzie knew but little more of her than that.\n\nLizzie considered herself still to be engaged to be married to Lord\nFawn,--but there was no sympathy to be had in that quarter. Frank\nGreystock might be induced to sympathise with her;--but hardly after\nthe fashion which Lizzie desired. And then sympathy in that direction\nwould be so dangerous should she decide upon going on with the Fawn\nmarriage. For the present she had quarrelled with Lord Fawn;--but\nthe very bitterness of that quarrel, and the decision with which her\nbetrothed had declared his intention of breaking off the match, made\nher the more resolute that she would marry him. During her journey to\nPortray she had again determined that he should be her husband; and,\nif so, advanced sympathy,--sympathy that would be pleasantly tender\nwith her cousin Frank, would be dangerous. She would be quite willing\nto accept even Miss Macnulty's sympathy, if that humble lady would\ngive it to her of the kind she wanted. She declared to herself that\nshe could pour herself out on Miss Macnulty's bosom, and mingle her\ntears even with Miss Macnulty's, if only Miss Macnulty would believe\nin her. If Miss Macnulty would be enthusiastic about the jewels,\nenthusiastic as to the wickedness of Lord Fawn, enthusiastic in\npraising Lizzie herself, Lizzie,--so she told herself,--would have\nshowered all the sweets of female friendship even on Miss Macnulty's\nhead. But Miss Macnulty was as hard as a deal board. She did as she\nwas bidden, thereby earning her bread. But there was no tenderness in\nher;--no delicacy;--no feeling;--no comprehension. It was thus that\nLady Eustace judged her humble companion; and in one respect she\njudged her rightly. Miss Macnulty did not believe in Lady Eustace,\nand was not sufficiently gifted to act up to a belief which she did\nnot entertain.\n\nPoor Lizzie! The world, in judging of people who are false and bad\nand selfish and prosperous to outward appearances, is apt to be hard\nupon them, and to forget the punishments which generally accompany\nsuch faults. Lizzie Eustace was very false and bad and selfish,--and,\nwe may say, very prosperous also; but in the midst of all she was\nthoroughly uncomfortable. She was never at ease. There was no green\nspot in her life with which she could be contented. And though, after\na fashion, she knew herself to be false and bad, she was thoroughly\nconvinced that she was ill-used by everybody about her. She was being\nvery badly treated by Lord Fawn;--but she flattered herself that she\nwould be able to make Lord Fawn know more of her character before she\nhad done with him.\n\nPortray Castle was really a castle,--not simply a country mansion so\ncalled, but a stone edifice with battlements and a round tower at one\ncorner, and a gate which looked as if it might have had a portcullis,\nand narrow windows in a portion of it, and a cannon mounted upon a\nlow roof, and an excavation called the moat,--but which was now a\nfantastic and somewhat picturesque garden,--running round two sides\nof it. In very truth, though a portion of the castle was undoubtedly\nold, and had been built when strength was needed for defence and\nprobably for the custody of booty,--the battlements, and the round\ntower, and the awe-inspiring gateway had all been added by one of\nthe late Sir Florians. But the castle looked like a castle, and was\ninteresting. As a house it was not particularly eligible, the castle\nform of domestic architecture being exigeant in its nature, and\ndemanding that space, which in less ambitious houses can be applied\nto comfort, shall be surrendered to magnificence. There was a great\nhall, and a fine dining-room with plate-glass windows looking out\nupon the sea; but the other sitting-rooms were insignificant, and the\nbedrooms were here and there, and were for the most part small and\ndark. That, however, which Lizzie had appropriated to her own use was\na grand chamber, looking also out upon the open sea.\n\nThe castle stood upon a bluff of land, with a fine prospect of the\nFirth of Clyde, and with a distant view of the Isle of Arran. When\nthe air was clear, as it often is clear there, the Arran hills\ncould be seen from Lizzie's window, and she was proud of talking of\nthe prospect. In other respects, perhaps, the castle was somewhat\ndesolate. There were a few stunted trees around it, but timber had\nnot prospered there. There was a grand kitchen garden,--or rather\na kitchen garden which had been intended to be grand;--but since\nLizzie's reign had been commenced, the grandeur had been neglected.\nGrand kitchen gardens are expensive, and Lizzie had at once been firm\nin reducing the under-gardeners from five men to one and a boy. The\nhead-gardener had of course left her at once; but that had not broken\nher heart, and she had hired a modest man at a guinea a week instead\nof a scientific artist, who was by no means modest, with a hundred\nand twenty pounds a year and coals, house, milk, and all other\nhorticultural luxuries. Though Lizzie was prosperous and had a fine\nincome, she was already aware that she could not keep up a town and\ncountry establishment and be a rich woman on four thousand a year.\nThere was a flower garden and small shrubbery within the so-called\nmoat; but, otherwise, the grounds of Portray Castle were not\nalluring. The place was sombre, exposed, and, in winter, very cold;\nand, except that the expanse of sea beneath the hill on which stood\nthe castle was fine and open, it had no great claim to praise on\nthe score of scenery. Behind the castle, and away from the sea,\nthe low mountains belonging to the estate stretched for some eight\nor ten miles; and towards the further end of them, where stood a\nshooting-lodge, called always The Cottage, the landscape became rough\nand grand. It was in this cottage that Frank Greystock was to be\nsheltered with his friend, when he came down to shoot what Lady\nEustace had called her three annual grouse.\n\nShe ought to have been happy and comfortable. There will, of\ncourse, be some to say that a young widow should not be happy and\ncomfortable,--that she should be weeping her lost lord, and subject\nto the desolation of bereavement. But as the world goes now, young\nwidows are not miserable; and there is, perhaps, a growing tendency\nin society to claim from them year by year still less of any misery\nthat may be avoidable. Suttee propensities of all sorts, from burning\nalive down to bombazine and hideous forms of clothing, are becoming\nless and less popular among the nations, and women are beginning to\nlearn that, let what misfortunes will come upon them, it is well for\nthem to be as happy as their nature will allow them to be. A woman\nmay thoroughly respect her husband, and mourn him truly, honestly,\nwith her whole heart, and yet enjoy thoroughly the good things which\nhe has left behind for her use. It was not, at any rate, sorrow for\nthe lost Sir Florian that made Lady Eustace uncomfortable. She had\nher child. She had her income. She had her youth and beauty. She\nhad Portray Castle. She had a new lover,--and, if she chose to be\nquit of him, not liking him well enough for the purpose, she might\nundoubtedly have another whom she would like better. She had hitherto\nbeen thoroughly successful in her life. And yet she was unhappy. What\nwas it that she wanted?\n\nShe had been a very clever child,--a clever, crafty child; and now\nshe was becoming a clever woman. Her craft remained with her; but\nso keen was her outlook upon the world, that she was beginning to\nperceive that craft, let it be never so crafty, will in the long\nrun miss its own object. She actually envied the simplicity of Lucy\nMorris, for whom she delighted to find evil names, calling her\ndemure, a prig, a sly puss, and so on. But she could see,--or half\nsee,--that Lucy with her simplicity was stronger than was she with\nher craft. She had nearly captivated Frank Greystock with her wiles,\nbut without any wiles Lucy had captivated him altogether. And a man\ncaptivated by wiles was only captivated for a time, whereas a man won\nby simplicity would be won for ever,--if he himself were worth the\nwinning. And this, too, she felt,--that let her success be what it\nmight, she could not be happy unless she could win a man's heart.\nShe had won Sir Florian's, but that had been but for an hour,--for a\nmonth or two. And then Sir Florian had never really won hers. Could\nnot she be simple? Could not she act simplicity so well that the\nthing acted should be as powerful as the thing itself;--perhaps even\nmore powerful? Poor Lizzie Eustace! In thinking over all this, she\nsaw a great deal. It was wonderful that she should see so much and\ntell herself so many home truths. But there was one truth she could\nnot see, and therefore could not tell it to herself. She had not\na heart to give. It had become petrified during those lessons of\nearly craft in which she had taught herself how to get the better of\nMessrs. Harter and Benjamin, of Sir Florian Eustace, of Lady\nLinlithgow, and of Mr. Camperdown.\n\nHer ladyship had now come down to her country house, leaving London\nand all its charms before the end of the season, actuated by various\nmotives. In the first place, the house in Mount Street was taken\nfurnished, by the month, and the servants were hired after the same\nfashion, and the horses jobbed. Lady Eustace was already sufficiently\nintimate with her accounts to know that she would save two hundred\npounds by not remaining another month or three weeks in London, and\nsufficiently observant of her own affairs to have perceived that\nsuch saving was needed. And then it appeared to her that her battle\nwith Lord Fawn could be better fought from a distance than at close\nquarters. London, too, was becoming absolutely distasteful to her.\nThere were many things there that tended to make her unhappy, and\nso few that she could enjoy! She was afraid of Mr. Camperdown, and\never on the rack lest some dreadful thing should come upon her in\nrespect of the necklace,--some horrible paper served upon her from a\nmagistrate, ordering her appearance at Newgate, or perhaps before the\nLord Chancellor, or a visit from policemen, who would be empowered\nto search for and carry off the iron box. And then there was so\nlittle in her London life to gratify her! It is pleasant to win in a\nfight;--but to be always fighting is not pleasant. Except in those\nmoments, few and far between, in which she was alone with her cousin\nFrank,--and perhaps in those other moments in which she wore her\ndiamonds,--she had but little in London that she enjoyed. She still\nthought that a time would come when it would be otherwise. Under\nthese influences she had actually made herself believe that she was\nsighing for the country, and for solitude; for the wide expanse of\nher own bright waves,--as she had called them,--and for the rocks of\ndear Portray. She had told Miss Macnulty and Augusta Fawn that she\nthirsted for the breezes of Ayrshire, so that she might return to her\nbooks and her thoughts. Amidst the whirl of London it was impossible\neither to read or to think. And she believed it too,--herself. She\nso believed it, that on the first morning of her arrival she took a\nlittle volume in her pocket, containing Shelley's \"Queen Mab,\" and\nessayed to go down upon the rocks. She had actually breakfasted at\nnine, and was out on the sloping grounds below the castle before ten,\nhaving made some boast to Miss Macnulty about the morning air.\n\nShe scrambled down,--not very far down, but a little way beneath the\ngarden gate, to a spot on which a knob of rock cropped out from the\nscanty herbage of the incipient cliff. Fifty yards lower the real\nrocks began; and, though the real rocks were not very rocky, not\nprecipitous or even bold, and were partially covered with salt-fed\nmosses down almost to the sea, nevertheless they justified her in\ntalking about her rock-bound shore. The shore was hers,--for her\nlife, and it was rock-bound. This knob she had espied from her\nwindows;--and, indeed, had been thinking of it for the last week,\nas a place appropriate to solitude and Shelley. She had stood on\nit before, and had stretched her arms with enthusiasm towards the\njust-visible mountains of Arran. On that occasion the weather,\nperhaps, had been cool; but now a blazing sun was overhead, and when\nshe had been seated half a minute, and \"Queen Mab\" had been withdrawn\nfrom her pocket, she found that it would not do. It would not do,\neven with the canopy she could make for herself with her parasol. So\nshe stood up and looked about herself for shade;--for shade in some\nspot in which she could still look out upon \"her dear wide ocean,\nwith its glittering smile.\" For it was thus that she would talk about\nthe mouth of the Clyde. Shelter near her there was none. The scrubby\ntrees lay nearly half a mile to the right,--and up the hill, too. She\nhad once clambered down to the actual shore, and might do so again.\nBut she doubted that there would be shelter even there; and the\nclambering up on that former occasion had been a nuisance, and would\nbe a worse nuisance now. Thinking of all this, and feeling the sun\nkeenly, she gradually retraced her steps to the garden within the\nmoat, and seated herself, Shelley in hand, within the summer-house.\nThe bench was narrow, hard, and broken; and there were some snails\nwhich discomposed her;--but, nevertheless, she would make the best\nof it. Her darling \"Queen Mab\" must be read without the coarse,\ninappropriate, every-day surroundings of a drawing-room; and it was\nnow manifest to her that, unless she could get up much earlier in the\nmorning, or come out to her reading after sunset, the knob of rock\nwould not avail her.\n\nShe began her reading, resolved that she would enjoy her poetry in\nspite of the narrow seat. She had often talked of \"Queen Mab,\" and\nperhaps she thought she had read it. This, however, was in truth her\nfirst attempt at that work. \"How wonderful is Death! Death and his\nbrother, Sleep!\" Then she half-closed the volume, and thought that\nshe enjoyed the idea. Death,--and his brother Sleep! She did not\nknow why they should be more wonderful than Action, or Life, or\nThought;--but the words were of a nature which would enable her to\nremember them, and they would be good for quoting. \"Sudden arose\nIanthe's soul; it stood all-beautiful in naked purity.\" The name of\nIanthe suited her exactly. And the antithesis conveyed to her mind\nby naked purity struck her strongly, and she determined to learn the\npassage by heart. Eight or nine lines were printed separately, like a\nstanza, and the labour would not be great, and the task, when done,\nwould be complete. \"Instinct with inexpressible beauty and grace,\nEach stain of earthliness Had passed away, it reassumed Its native\ndignity, and stood Immortal amid ruin.\" Which was instinct with\nbeauty,--the stain or the soul, she did not stop to inquire, and may\nbe excused for not understanding. \"Ah,\"--she exclaimed to herself,\n\"how true it is; how one feels it; how it comes home to one!--'Sudden\narose Ianthe's soul!'\" And then she walked about the garden,\nrepeating the words to herself, and almost forgetting the heat.\n\"'Each stain of earthliness had passed away.' Ha;--yes. They will\npass away, and become instinct with beauty and grace.\" A dim idea\ncame upon her that when this happy time should arrive, no one\nwould claim her necklace from her, and that the man at the stables\nwould not be so disagreeably punctual in sending in his bill.\n\"'All-beautiful in naked purity!'\" What a tawdry world was this, in\nwhich clothes and food and houses are necessary! How perfectly that\nboy-poet had understood it all! \"'Immortal amid ruin!'\" She liked the\nidea of the ruin almost as well as that of the immortality, and the\nstains quite as well as the purity. As immortality must come, and as\nstains were instinct with grace, why be afraid of ruin? But then, if\npeople go wrong,--at least women,--they are not asked out any where!\n\"'Sudden arose Ianthe's soul; it stood all-beautiful--'\" And so the\npiece was learned, and Lizzie felt that she had devoted her hour to\npoetry in a quite rapturous manner. At any rate she had a bit to\nquote; and though in truth she did not understand the exact bearing\nof the image, she had so studied her gestures, and so modulated her\nvoice, that she knew that she could be effective. She did not then\ncare to carry her reading further, but returned with the volume into\nthe house. Though the passage about Ianthe's soul comes very early\nin the work, she was now quite familiar with the poem, and when, in\nafter days, she spoke of it as a thing of beauty that she had made\nher own by long study, she actually did not know that she was lying.\nAs she grew older, however, she quickly became wiser, and was aware\nthat in learning one passage of a poem it is expedient to select\none in the middle, or at the end. The world is so cruelly observant\nnow-a-days, that even men and women who have not themselves read\ntheir \"Queen Mab\" will know from what part of the poem a morsel is\nextracted, and will not give you credit for a page beyond that from\nwhich your passage comes.\n\nAfter lunch Lizzie invited Miss Macnulty to sit at the open window of\nthe drawing-room and look out upon the \"glittering waves.\" In giving\nMiss Macnulty her due, we must acknowledge that, though she owned no\nactual cleverness herself, had no cultivated tastes, read but little,\nand that little of a colourless kind, and thought nothing of her\nhours but that she might get rid of them and live,--yet she had a\ncertain power of insight, and could see a thing. Lizzie Eustace\nwas utterly powerless to impose upon her. Such as Lizzie was, Miss\nMacnulty was willing to put up with her and accept her bread. The\npeople whom she had known had been either worthless,--as had been\nher own father, or cruel,--like Lady Linlithgow, or false,--as was\nLady Eustace. Miss Macnulty knew that worthlessness, cruelty, and\nfalseness had to be endured by such as she. And she could bear them\nwithout caring much about them;--not condemning them, even within\nher own heart, very heavily. But she was strangely deficient in\nthis,--that she could not call these qualities by other names, even\nto the owners of them. She was unable to pretend to believe Lizzie's\nrhapsodies. It was hardly conscience or a grand spirit of truth that\nactuated her, as much as a want of the courage needed for lying. She\nhad not had the face to call old Lady Linlithgow kind, and therefore\nold Lady Linlithgow had turned her out of the house. When Lady\nEustace called on her for sympathy, she had not courage enough to\ndare to attempt the bit of acting which would be necessary for\nsympathetic expression. She was like a dog or a child, and was unable\nnot to be true. Lizzie was longing for a little mock sympathy,--was\nlonging to show off her Shelley, and was very kind to Miss Macnulty\nwhen she got the poor lady into the recess of the window. \"This is\nnice;--is it not?\" she said, as she spread her hand out through the\nopen space towards the \"wide expanse of glittering waves.\"\n\n\"Very nice,--only it glares so,\" said Miss Macnulty.\n\n\"Ah, I love the full warmth of the real summer. With me it always\nseems that the sun is needed to bring to true ripeness the fruit of\nthe heart.\" Nevertheless she had been much troubled both by the heat\nand by the midges when she tried to sit on the stone. \"I always think\nof those few glorious days which I passed with my darling Florian\nat Naples;--days too glorious because they were so few.\" Now Miss\nMacnulty knew some of the history of those days and of their\nglory,--and knew also how the widow had borne her loss.\n\n\"I suppose the bay of Naples is fine,\" she said.\n\n\"It is not only the bay. There are scenes there which ravish you,\nonly it is necessary that there should be some one with you that can\nunderstand you. 'Soul of Ianthe!'\" she said, meaning to apostrophise\nthat of the deceased Sir Florian. \"You have read 'Queen Mab'?\"\n\n\"I don't know that I ever did. If I have, I have forgotten it.\"\n\n\"Ah,--you should read it. I know nothing in the English language that\nbrings home to one so often one's own best feelings and aspirations.\n'It stands all-beautiful in naked purity,'\" she continued, still\nalluding to poor Sir Florian's soul. \"'Instinct with inexpressible\nbeauty and grace, Each stain of earthliness had passed away.' I can\nsee him now in all his manly beauty, as we used to sit together by\nthe hour, looking over the waters. Oh, Julia, the thing itself has\ngone,--the earthly reality; but the memory of it will live for ever!\"\n\n\"He was a very handsome man, certainly,\" said Miss Macnulty, finding\nherself forced to say something.\n\n\"I see him now,\" she went on, still gazing out upon the shining\nwater. \"'It reassumed its native dignity, and stood Primeval amid\nruin.' Is not that a glorious idea, gloriously worded?\" She had\nforgotten one word and used a wrong epithet; but it sounded just as\nwell. Primeval seemed to her to be a very poetical word.\n\n\"To tell the truth,\" said Miss Macnulty, \"I never understand poetry\nwhen it is quoted unless I happen to know the passage beforehand. I\nthink I'll go away from this, for the light is too much for my poor\nold eyes.\" Certainly Miss Macnulty had fallen into a profession for\nwhich she was not suited.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nLady Eustace Procures a Pony for the Use of Her Cousin\n\n\nLady Eustace could make nothing of Miss Macnulty in the way of\nsympathy, and could not bear her disappointment with patience. It was\nhardly to be expected that she should do so. She paid a great deal\nfor Miss Macnulty. In a moment of rash generosity, and at a time when\nshe hardly knew what money meant, she had promised Miss Macnulty\nseventy pounds for the first year, and seventy for the second, should\nthe arrangement last longer than a twelvemonth. The second year had\nbeen now commenced, and Lady Eustace was beginning to think that\nseventy pounds was a great deal of money when so very little was\ngiven in return. Lady Linlithgow had paid her dependant no fixed\nsalary. And then there was the lady's \"keep,\" and first-class\ntravelling when they went up and down to Scotland, and cab-fares\nin London when it was desirable that Miss Macnulty should absent\nherself. Lizzie, reckoning all up, and thinking that for so much\nher friend ought to be ready to discuss Ianthe's soul, or any other\nkindred subject, at a moment's warning, would become angry, and would\ntell herself that she was being swindled out of her money. She knew\nhow necessary it was that she should have some companion at the\npresent emergency of her life, and therefore could not at once send\nMiss Macnulty away; but she would sometimes become very cross, and\nwould tell poor Macnulty that she was--a fool. Upon the whole,\nhowever, to be called a fool was less objectionable to Miss Macnulty\nthan were demands for sympathy which she did not know how to give.\n\nThose first ten days of August went very slowly with Lady Eustace.\n\"Queen Mab\" got itself poked away, and was heard of no more. But\nthere were other books. A huge box full of novels had come down, and\nMiss Macnulty was a great devourer of novels. If Lady Eustace would\ntalk to her about the sorrows of the poorest heroine that ever saw\nher lover murdered before her eyes, and then come to life again with\nten thousand pounds a year,--for a period of three weeks, or till\nanother heroine, who had herself been murdered, obliterated the\nformer horrors from her plastic mind,--Miss Macnulty could discuss\nthe catastrophe with the keenest interest. And Lizzie, finding\nherself to be, as she told herself, unstrung, fell also into\nnovel-reading. She had intended during this vacant time to master the\n\"Faery Queen;\" but the \"Faery Queen\" fared even worse than \"Queen\nMab;\"--and the studies of Portray Castle were confined to novels. For\npoor Macnulty, if she could only be left alone, this was well enough.\nTo have her meals, and her daily walk, and her fill of novels, and\nto be left alone, was all that she asked of the gods. But it was not\nso with Lady Eustace. She asked much more than that, and was now\nthoroughly discontented with her own idleness. She was sure that she\ncould have read Spenser from sunrise to sundown, with no other break\nthan an hour or two given to Shelley,--if only there had been some\none to sympathise with her in her readings. But there was no one,\nand she was very cross. Then there came a letter to her from her\ncousin,--which for that morning brought some life back to the castle.\n\"I have seen Lord Fawn,\" said the letter, \"and I have also seen Mr.\nCamperdown. As it would be very hard to explain what took place at\nthese interviews by letter, and as I shall be at Portray Castle on\nthe 20th,--I will not make the attempt. We shall go down by the night\ntrain, and I will get over to you as soon as I have dressed and\nhad my breakfast. I suppose I can find some kind of a pony for the\njourney. The 'we' consists of myself and my friend, Mr. Herriot,--a\nman whom I think you will like, if you will condescend to see him,\nthough he is a barrister like myself. You need express no immediate\ncondescension in his favour, as I shall of course come over alone on\nWednesday morning. Yours always affectionately, F. G.\"\n\nThe letter she received on the Sunday morning, and as the Wednesday\nnamed for Frank's coming was the next Wednesday, and was close at\nhand, she was in rather a better humour than she had displayed since\nthe poets had failed her. \"What a blessing it will be,\" she said, \"to\nhave somebody to speak to!\"\n\nThis was not complimentary, but Miss Macnulty did not want\ncompliments. \"Yes, indeed,\" she said. \"Of course you will be glad to\nsee your cousin.\"\n\n\"I shall be glad to see anything in the shape of a man. I declare\nthat I have felt almost inclined to ask the minister from Craigie to\nelope with me.\"\n\n\"He has got seven children,\" said Miss Macnulty.\n\n\"Yes, poor man, and a wife, and not more than enough to live upon. I\ndaresay he would have come. By-the-bye, I wonder whether there's a\npony about the place.\"\n\n\"A pony!\" Miss Macnulty of course supposed that it was needed for the\npurpose of the suggested elopement.\n\n\"Yes;--I suppose you know what a pony is? Of course there ought to\nbe a shooting pony at the cottage for these men. My poor head has so\nmany things to work upon that I had forgotten it; and you're never\nany good at thinking of things.\"\n\n\"I didn't know that gentlemen wanted ponies for shooting.\"\n\n\"I wonder what you do know? Of course there must be a pony.\"\n\n\"I suppose you'll want two?\"\n\n\"No, I sha'n't. You don't suppose that men always go riding about.\nBut I want one. What had I better do?\" Miss Macnulty suggested that\nGowran should be consulted. Now, Gowran was the steward and bailiff\nand manager and factotum about the place, who bought a cow or sold\none if occasion required, and saw that nobody stole anything, and\nwho knew the boundaries of the farms, and all about the tenants,\nand looked after the pipes when frost came, and was an honest,\ndomineering, hard-working, intelligent Scotchman, who had been\nbrought up to love the Eustaces, and who hated his present mistress\nwith all his heart. He did not leave her service, having an idea in\nhis mind that it was now the great duty of his life to save Portray\nfrom her ravages. Lizzie fully returned the compliment of the hatred,\nand was determined to rid herself of Andy Gowran's services as soon\nas possible. He had been called Andy by the late Sir Florian, and,\nthough every one else about the place called him Mr. Gowran, Lady\nEustace thought it became her, as the man's mistress, to treat him\nas he had been treated by the late master. So she called him Andy.\nBut she was resolved to get rid of him,--as soon as she should dare.\nThere were things which it was essential that somebody about the\nplace should know, and no one knew them but Mr. Gowran. Every servant\nin the castle might rob her, were it not for the protection afforded\nby Mr. Gowran. In that affair of the garden it was Mr. Gowran who had\nenabled her to conquer the horticultural Leviathan who had oppressed\nher, and who, in point of wages, had been a much bigger man than\nMr. Gowran himself. She trusted Mr. Gowran, and hated him,--whereas\nMr. Gowran hated her, and did not trust her. \"I believe you think\nthat nothing can be done at Portray except by that man,\" said Lady\nEustace.\n\n\"He'll know how much you ought to pay for the pony.\"\n\n\"Yes,--and get some brute not fit for my cousin to ride, on purpose,\nperhaps, to break his neck.\"\n\n\"Then I should ask Mr. Macallum, the postmaster of Troon, for I have\nseen three or four very quiet-looking ponies standing in the carts at\nhis door.\"\n\n\"Macnulty, if there ever was an idiot you are one!\" said Lady\nEustace, throwing up her hands. \"To think that I should get a pony\nfor my cousin Frank out of one of the mail carts.\"\n\n\"I daresay I am an idiot,\" said Miss Macnulty, resuming her novel.\n\nLady Eustace was, of course, obliged to have recourse to Gowran, to\nwhom she applied on the Monday morning. Not even Lizzie Eustace, on\nbehalf of her cousin Frank, would have dared to disturb Mr. Gowran\nwith considerations respecting a pony on the Sabbath. On the Monday\nmorning she found Mr. Gowran superintending four boys and three old\nwomen, who were making a bit of her ladyship's hay on the ground\nabove the castle. The ground about the castle was poor and exposed,\nand her ladyship's hay was apt to be late. \"Andy,\" she said, \"I shall\nwant to get a pony for the gentlemen who are coming to the Cottage.\nIt must be there by Tuesday evening.\"\n\n\"A pownie, my leddie?\"\n\n\"Yes;--a pony. I suppose a pony may be purchased in Ayrshire,--though\nof all places in the world it seems to have the fewest of the\ncomforts of life.\"\n\n\"Them as find it like that, my leddie, needn't bide there.\"\n\n\"Never mind. You will have the kindness to have a pony purchased and\nput into the stables of the Cottage on Tuesday afternoon. There are\nstables, no doubt.\"\n\n\"Oh, ay,--there's shelter, nae doot, for mair pownies than they'll\nride. When the Cottage was biggit, my leddie, there was nae cause for\nsparing nowt.\" Andy Gowran was continually throwing her comparative\npoverty in poor Lizzie's teeth, and there was nothing he could do\nwhich displeased her more.\n\n\"And I needn't spare my cousin the use of a pony,\" she said\ngrandiloquently, but feeling as she did so that she was exposing\nherself before the man. \"You'll have the goodness to procure one for\nhim on Tuesday.\"\n\n\"But there ain't aits nor yet fother, nor nowt for bedding down.\nAnd wha's to tent the pownie? There's mair in keeping a pownie than\nyour leddyship thinks. It'll be a matter of auchteen and saxpence a\nweek,--will a pownie.\" Mr. Gowran, as he expressed his prudential\nscruples, put a very strong emphasis indeed on the sixpence.\n\n\"Very well. Let it be so.\"\n\n\"And there'll be the beastie to buy, my leddie. He'll be a lump of\nmoney, my leddie. Pownies ain't to be had for nowt in Ayrshire, as\nwas ance, my leddie.\"\n\n\"Of course I must pay for him.\"\n\n\"He'll be a matter of ten pound, my leddie.\"\n\n\"Very well.\"\n\n\"Or may be twal; just as likely.\" And Mr. Gowran shook his head at\nhis mistress in a most uncomfortable way. It was not surprising that\nshe should hate him.\n\n\"You must give the proper price,--of course.\"\n\n\"There ain't no proper prices for pownies,--as there is for jew'ls\nand sich like.\" If this was intended for sarcasm upon Lady Eustace in\nregard to her diamonds, Mr. Gowran ought to have been dismissed on\nthe spot. In such a case no English jury would have given him his\ncurrent wages. \"And he'll be to sell again, my leddie?\"\n\n\"We shall see about that afterwards.\"\n\n\"Ye'll never let him eat his head off there a' the winter! He'll\nbe to sell. And the gentles'll ride him, may be, ance across the\nhillside, out and back. As to the grouse, they can't cotch them\nwith the pownie, for there ain't none to cotch.\" There had been two\nkeepers on the mountains,--men who were paid five or six shillings a\nweek to look after the game in addition to their other callings, and\none of these had been sent away, actually in obedience to Gowran's\nadvice;--so that this blow was cruel and unmanly. He made it, too, as\nsevere as he could by another shake of his head.\n\n\"Do you mean to tell me that my cousin cannot be supplied with an\nanimal to ride upon?\"\n\n\"My leddie, I've said nowt o' the kind. There ain't no useful animal\nas I kens the name and nature of as he can't have in Ayrshire,--for\npaying for it, my leddie;--horse, pownie, or ass, just whichever you\nplease, my leddie. But there'll be a seddle--\"\n\n\"A what?\"\n\nThere can be no doubt that Gowran purposely slurred the word so that\nhis mistress should not understand him. \"Seddles don't come for nowt,\nmy leddie, though it be Ayrshire.\"\n\n\"I don't understand what it is that you say, Andy.\"\n\n\"A seddle, my leddie,\"--said he, shouting the word at her at the top\nof his voice,--\"and a briddle. I suppose as your leddyship's cousin\ndon't ride bare-back up in Lunnon?\"\n\n\"Of course there must be the necessary horse-furniture,\" said Lady\nEustace, retiring to the castle. Andy Gowran had certainly ill-used\nher, and she swore that she would have revenge. Nor when she was\ninformed on the Tuesday that an adequate pony had been hired for\neighteen pence a day, saddle, bridle, groom, and all included, was\nher heart at all softened towards Mr. Gowran.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nFrank Greystock's First Visit to Portray\n\n\nHad Frank Greystock known all that his cousin endured for his\ncomfort, would he have been grateful? Women, when they are fond of\nmen, do think much of men's comfort in small matters, and men are apt\nto take the good things provided almost as a matter of course. When\nFrank Greystock and Herriot reached the cottage about nine o'clock in\nthe morning, having left London over night by the limited mail train,\nthe pony at once presented itself to them. It was a little shaggy,\nblack beast, with a boy almost as shaggy as itself, but they were\nboth good of their kind. \"Oh, you're the laddie with the pownie, are\nyou?\" said Frank, in answer to an announcement made to him by the\nboy. He did at once perceive that Lizzie had taken notice of the word\nin his note, in which he had suggested that some means of getting\nover to Portray would be needed, and he learned from the fact that\nshe was thinking of him and anxious to see him.\n\nHis friend was a man a couple of years younger than himself, who had\nhitherto achieved no success at the Bar, but who was nevertheless a\nclever, diligent, well-instructed man. He was what the world calls\npenniless, having an income from his father just sufficient to keep\nhim like a gentleman. He was not much known as a sportsman, his\nopportunities for shooting not having been great; but he dearly loved\nthe hills and fresh air, and the few grouse which were,--or were\nnot,--on Lady Eustace's mountains would go as far with him as they\nwould with any man. Before he had consented to come with Frank, he\nhad especially inquired whether there was a game-keeper, and it was\nnot till he had been assured that there was no officer attached to\nthe estate worthy of such a name, that he had consented to come upon\nhis present expedition. \"I don't clearly know what a gillie is,\" he\nsaid, in answer to one of Frank's explanations. \"If a gillie means\na lad without any breeches on, I don't mind; but I couldn't stand a\nsevere man got up in well-made velveteens, who would see through my\nignorance in a moment, and make known by comment the fact that he had\ndone so.\" Greystock had promised that there should be no severity,\nand Herriot had come. Greystock brought with him two guns, two\nfishing-rods, a man-servant, and a huge hamper from Fortnum and\nMason's. Arthur Herriot, whom the attorneys had not yet loved,\nbrought some very thick boots, a pair of knickerbockers, together\nwith Stone and Toddy's \"Digest of the Common Law.\" The best of the\nlegal profession consists in this;--that when you get fairly at work\nyou may give over working. An aspirant must learn everything; but\na man may make his fortune at it, and know almost nothing. He may\nexamine a witness with judgment, see through a case with precision,\naddress a jury with eloquence,--and yet be altogether ignorant of\nlaw. But he must be believed to be a very pundit before he will get\na chance of exercising his judgment, his precision, or his eloquence.\nThe men whose names are always in the newspapers never look at their\nStone and Toddy,--care for it not at all,--have their Stone and Toddy\ngot up for them by their juniors when cases require that reference\nshall be made to precedents. But till that blessed time has come, a\nbarrister who means success should carry his Stone and Toddy with him\neverywhere. Greystock never thought of the law now, unless he had\nsome special case in hand; but Herriot could not afford to go out on\nhis holiday without two volumes of Stone and Toddy's Digest in his\nportmanteau.\n\n\"You won't mind being left alone for the first morning?\" said Frank,\nas soon as they had finished the contents of one of the pots from\nFortnum and Mason.\n\n\"Not in the least. Stone and Toddy will carry me through.\"\n\n\"I'd go on the mountain if I were you, and get into a habit of steady\nloading.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I will take a turn,--just to find out how I feel in the\nknickerbockers. At what time shall I dine if you don't come back?\"\n\n\"I shall certainly be here to dinner,\" said Frank, \"unless the pony\nfails me or I get lost on the mountain.\" Then he started, and Herriot\nat once went to work on Stone and Toddy, with a pipe in his mouth. He\nhad travelled all night, and it is hardly necessary to say that in\nfive minutes he was fast asleep.\n\nSo also had Frank travelled all night, but the pony and the fresh air\nkept him awake. The boy had offered to go with him, but that he had\naltogether refused;--and, therefore, to his other cares was added\nthat of finding his way. The sweep of the valleys, however, is long\nand not abrupt, and he could hardly miss his road if he would only\nmake one judicious turn through a gap in a certain wall which lay\nhalf way between the cottage and the castle. He was thinking of the\nwork in hand, and he found the gap without difficulty. When through\nthat he ascended the hill for two miles, and then the sea was before\nhim, and Portray Castle, lying, as it seemed to him at that distance,\nclose upon the sea-shore. \"Upon my word, Lizzie has not done badly\nfor herself,\" he said almost aloud, as he looked down upon the fair\nsight beneath him, and round upon the mountains, and remembered that,\nfor her life at least, it was all hers, and after her death would\nbelong to her son. What more does any human being desire of such a\nproperty than that?\n\nHe rode down to the great doorway,--the mountain track which fell\non to the road about half a mile from the castle having been plain\nenough, and there he gave up the pony into the hands of no less a\nman than Mr. Gowran himself. Gowran had watched the pony coming down\nthe mountain-side, and had desired to see of what like was \"her\nleddyship's\" cousin. In telling the whole truth of Mr. Gowran, it\nmust be acknowledged that he thought that his late master had made\na very great mistake in the matter of his marriage. He could not\nimagine bad things enough of Lady Eustace, and almost believed that\nshe was not now, and hadn't been before her marriage, any better than\nshe should be. The name of Admiral Greystock, as having been the\nfather of his mistress, had indeed reached his ears; but Andy Gowran\nwas a suspicious man, and felt no confidence even in an admiral,--in\nregard to whom he heard nothing of his having, or having had, a wife.\n\"It's my fer-rm opeenion she's jist naebody--and waur,\" he had said\nmore than once to his own wife, nodding his head with great emphasis\nat the last word. He was very anxious, therefore, to see \"her\nleddyship's\" cousin. Mr. Gowran thought that he knew a gentleman\nwhen he saw one. He thought, also, that he knew a lady, and that he\ndidn't see one when he was engaged with his mistress. Cousin, indeed!\n\"For the matter o' that, ony man that comes the way may be ca'ed a\ncoosin.\" So Mr. Gowran was on the grand sweep before the garden gate,\nand took the pony from Frank's hand. \"Is Lady Eustace at home?\" Frank\nasked. Mr. Gowran perceived that Frank was a gentleman, and was\ndisappointed. And Frank didn't come as a man comes who calls himself\nby a false name, and pretends to be an honest cousin when in fact\nhe is something,--oh, ever so wicked! Mr. Gowran, who was a stern\nmoralist, was certainly disappointed at Frank's appearance.\n\nLizzie was in a little sitting-room, reached by a long passage with\nsteps in the middle, at some corner of the castle which seemed a long\nway from the great door. It was a cheerful little room, with chintz\ncurtains, and a few shelves laden with brightly-bound books, which\nhad been prepared for Lizzie immediately on her marriage. It looked\nout upon the sea, and she had almost taught herself to think that\nhere she had sat with her adored Florian, gazing in mutual ecstasy\nupon the \"wide expanse of glittering waves.\" She was lying back\nin a low arm-chair as her cousin entered, and she did not rise to\nreceive him. Of course she was alone, Miss Macnulty having received\na suggestion that it would be well that she should do a little\ngardening in the moat. \"Well, Frank?\" she said, with her sweetest\nsmile, as she gave him her hand. She felt and understood the extreme\nintimacy which would be implied by her not rising to receive him. As\nshe could not rush into his arms there was no device by which she\ncould more clearly show to him how close she regarded his friendship.\n\n\"So I am at Portray Castle at last,\" he said, still holding her hand.\n\n\"Yes,--at the dullest, dreariest, deadliest spot in all Christendom,\nI think,--if Ayrshire be Christendom. But never mind about that now.\nPerhaps, as you are at the other side of the mountain at the Cottage,\nwe shall find it less dull here at the castle.\"\n\n\"I thought you were to be so happy here.\"\n\n\"Sit down and we'll talk it all over by degrees. What will you\nhave,--breakfast or lunch?\"\n\n\"Neither, thank you.\"\n\n\"Of course you'll stay to dinner?\"\n\n\"No, indeed. I've a man there at the Cottage with me who would cut\nhis throat in his solitude.\"\n\n\"Let him cut his throat;--but never mind now. As for being happy,\nwomen are never happy without men. I needn't tell any lies to you,\nyou know. What makes me sure that this fuss about making men and\nwomen all the same must be wrong, is just the fact that men can get\nalong without women, and women can't without men. My life has been a\nburthen to me. But never mind. Tell me about my lord;--my lord and\nmaster.\"\n\n\"Lord Fawn?\"\n\n\"Who else? What other lord and master? My bosom's own; my heart's\nbest hope; my spot of terra firma; my cool running brook of fresh\nwater; my rock; my love; my lord; my all! Is he always thinking of\nhis absent Lizzie? Does he still toil at Downing Street? Oh, dear; do\nyou remember, Frank, when he told us that 'one of us must remain in\ntown?'\"\n\n\"I have seen him.\"\n\n\"So you wrote me word.\"\n\n\"And I have seen a very obstinate, pig-headed, but nevertheless\nhonest and truth-speaking gentleman.\"\n\n\"Frank, I don't care twopence for his honesty and truth. If he\nill-treats me--\" Then she paused; looking into his face she had seen\nat once by the manner in which he had taken her badinage, without a\nsmile, that it was necessary that she should be serious as to her\nmatrimonial prospects. \"I suppose I had better let you tell your\nstory,\" she said, \"and I will sit still and listen.\"\n\n\"He means to ill-treat you.\"\n\n\"And you will let him?\"\n\n\"You had better listen, as you promised, Lizzie. He declares that the\nmarriage must be off at once unless you will send those diamonds to\nMr. Camperdown or to the jewellers.\"\n\n\"And by what law or rule does he justify himself in a decision so\nmonstrous? Is he prepared to prove that the property is not my own?\"\n\n\"If you ask me my opinion as a lawyer, I doubt whether any such proof\ncan be shown. But as a man and a friend I do advise you to give them\nup.\"\n\n\"Never!\"\n\n\"You must, of course, judge for yourself;--but that is my advice. You\nhad better, however, hear my whole story.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Lizzie. Her whole manner was now changed. She had\nextricated herself from the crouching position in which her feet, her\ncurl, her arms, her whole body had been so arranged as to combine the\ncharm of her beauty with the charm of proffered intimacy. Her dress\nwas such as a woman would wear to receive her brother, and yet it\nhad been studied. She had no gems about her but what she might well\nwear in her ordinary life, and yet the very rings on her fingers had\nnot been put on without reference to her cousin Frank. Her position\nhad been one of lounging ease, such as a woman might adopt when all\nalone, giving herself all the luxuries of solitude;--but she had\nadopted it in special reference to cousin Frank. Now she was in\nearnest, with business before her; and though it may be said of her\nthat she could never forget her appearance in presence of a man whom\nshe desired to please, her curl, and rings, and attitude were for the\nmoment in the background. She had seated herself on a common chair,\nwith her hands upon the table, and was looking into Frank's face with\neager, eloquent, and combative eyes. She would take his law, because\nshe believed in it; but, as far as she could see as yet, she would\nnot take his advice unless it were backed by his law.\n\n\"Mr. Camperdown,\" continued Greystock, \"has consented to prepare a\ncase for opinion, though he will not agree that the Eustace estate\nshall be bound by that opinion.\"\n\n\"Then what's the good of it?\"\n\n\"We shall at least know, all of us, what is the opinion of some\nlawyer qualified to understand the circumstances of the case.\"\n\n\"Why isn't your opinion as good as that of any lawyer?\"\n\n\"I couldn't give an opinion;--not otherwise than as a private friend\nto you, which is worth nothing, unless for your private guidance. Mr.\nCamperdown--\"\n\n\"I don't care one straw for Mr. Camperdown.\"\n\n\"Just let me finish.\"\n\n\"Oh, certainly;--and you mustn't be angry with me, Frank. The matter\nis so much to me; isn't it?\"\n\n\"I won't be angry. Do I look as if I were angry? Mr. Camperdown is\nright.\"\n\n\"I daresay he may be--what you call right. But I don't care about Mr.\nCamperdown a bit.\"\n\n\"He has no power, nor has John Eustace any power, to decide that the\nproperty which may belong to a third person shall be jeopardised by\nany arbitration. The third person could not be made to lose his legal\nright by any such arbitration, and his claim, if made, would still\nhave to be tried.\"\n\n\"Who is the third person, Frank?\"\n\n\"Your own child at present.\"\n\n\"And will not he have it any way?\"\n\n\"Camperdown and John Eustace say that it belongs to him at present.\nIt is a point that, no doubt, should be settled.\"\n\n\"To whom do you say that it belongs?\"\n\n\"That is a question I am not prepared to answer.\"\n\n\"To whom do you think that it belongs?\"\n\n\"I have refused to look at a single paper on the subject, and my\nopinion is worth nothing. From what I have heard in conversation with\nMr. Camperdown and John Eustace, I cannot find that they make their\ncase good.\"\n\n\"Nor can I,\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"A case is to be prepared for Mr. Dove.\"\n\n\"Who is Mr. Dove?\"\n\n\"Mr. Dove is a barrister, and no doubt a very clever fellow. If his\nopinion be such as Mr. Camperdown expects, he will at once proceed\nagainst you at law for the immediate recovery of the necklace.\"\n\n\"I shall be ready for him,\" said Lizzie, and as she spoke all her\nlittle feminine softnesses were for the moment laid aside.\n\n\"If Mr. Dove's opinion be in your favour--\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Lizzie,--\"what then?\"\n\n\"In that case Mr. Camperdown, acting on behalf of John Eustace and\nyoung Florian--\"\n\n\"How dreadful it is to hear of my bitterest enemy acting on behalf of\nmy own child!\" said Lizzie, holding up her hands piteously. \"Well?\"\n\n\"In that case Mr. Camperdown will serve you with some notice that the\njewels are not yours,--to part with them as you may please.\"\n\n\"But they will be mine.\"\n\n\"He says not;--but in such case he will content himself with taking\nsteps which may prevent you from selling them.\"\n\n\"Who says that I want to sell them?\" demanded Lizzie indignantly.\n\n\"Or from giving them away,--say to a second husband.\"\n\n\"How little they know me!\"\n\n\"Now I have told you all about Mr. Camperdown.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And the next thing is to tell you about Lord Fawn.\"\n\n\"That is everything. I care nothing for Mr. Camperdown; nor yet for\nMr. Dove,--if that is his absurd name. Lord Fawn is of more moment to\nme,--though, indeed, he has given me but little cause to say so.\"\n\n\"In the first place, I must explain to you that Lord Fawn is very\nunhappy.\"\n\n\"He may thank himself for it.\"\n\n\"He is pulled this way and that, and is half distraught; but he has\nstated with as much positive assurance as such a man can assume, that\nthe match must be regarded as broken off unless you will at once\nrestore the necklace.\"\n\n\"He does?\"\n\n\"He has commissioned me to give you that message;--and it is my duty,\nLizzie, as your friend, to tell you my conviction that he repents his\nengagement.\"\n\nShe now rose from her chair and began to walk about the room. \"He\nshall not go back from it. He shall learn that I am not a creature\nat his own disposal in that way. He shall find that I have some\nstrength,--if you have none.\"\n\n\"What would you have had me do?\"\n\n\"Taken him by the throat,\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"Taking by the throat in these days seldom forwards any\nobject,--unless the taken one be known to the police. I think Lord\nFawn is behaving very badly, and I have told him so. No doubt he is\nunder the influence of others,--mother and sisters,--who are not\nfriendly to you.\"\n\n\"False-faced idiots!\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"He himself is somewhat afraid of me,--is much afraid of you;--is\nafraid of what people will say of him; and,--to give him his due,--is\nafraid also of doing what is wrong. He is timid, weak, conscientious,\nand wretched. If you have set your heart upon marrying him--\"\n\n\"My heart!\" said Lizzie scornfully.\n\n\"Or your mind,--you can have him by simply sending the diamonds to\nthe jewellers. Whatever may be his wishes, in that case he will\nredeem his word.\"\n\n\"Not for him or all that belongs to him! It wouldn't be much. He's\njust a pauper with a name.\"\n\n\"Then your loss will be so much the less.\"\n\n\"But what right has he to treat me so? Did you ever before hear\nof such a thing? Why is he to be allowed to go back,--without\npunishment,--more than another?\"\n\n\"What punishment would you wish?\"\n\n\"That he should be beaten within an inch of his life;--and if the\ninch were not there, I should not complain.\"\n\n\"And I am to do it,--to my absolute ruin, and to your great injury?\"\n\n\"I think I could almost do it myself.\" And Lizzie raised her hand\nas though there were some weapon in it. \"But, Frank, there must be\nsomething. You wouldn't have me sit down and bear it. All the world\nhas been told of the engagement. There must be some punishment.\"\n\n\"You would not wish to have an action brought,--for breach of\npromise?\"\n\n\"I would wish to do whatever would hurt him most,--without hurting\nmyself,\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"You won't give up the necklace?\" said Frank.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" said Lizzie. \"Give it up for his sake,--a man that I\nhave always despised?\"\n\n\"Then you had better let him go.\"\n\n\"I will not let him go. What,--to be pointed at as the woman that\nLord Fawn had jilted? Never! My necklace should be nothing more to\nhim than this ring.\" And she drew from her finger a little circlet of\ngold with a stone, for which she had owed Messrs. Harter and Benjamin\nfive-and-thirty pounds till Sir Florian had settled that account for\nher. \"What cause can he give for such treatment?\"\n\n\"He acknowledges that there is no cause which he can state openly.\"\n\n\"And I am to bear it? And it is you that tell me so? Oh, Frank!\"\n\n\"Let us understand each other, Lizzie. I will not fight him,--that\nis, with pistols; nor will I attempt to thrash him. It would be\nuseless to argue whether public opinion is right or wrong; but public\nopinion is now so much opposed to that kind of thing, that it is out\nof the question. I should injure your position and destroy my own. If\nyou mean to quarrel with me on that score, you had better say so.\"\n\nPerhaps at that moment he almost wished that she would quarrel with\nhim, but she was otherwise disposed. \"Oh, Frank,\" she said, \"do not\ndesert me.\"\n\n\"I will not desert you.\"\n\n\"You feel that I am ill-used, Frank?\"\n\n\"I do. I think that his conduct is inexcusable.\"\n\n\"And there is to be no punishment?\" she asked, with that strong\nindignation at injustice which the unjust always feel when they are\ninjured.\n\n\"If you carry yourself well,--quietly and with dignity,--the world\nwill punish him.\"\n\n\"I don't believe a bit of it. I am not a Patient Grizel who can\ncontent myself with heaping benefits on those who injure me, and then\nthinking that they are coals of fire. Lucy Morris is one of that\nsort.\" Frank ought to have resented the attack, but he did not. \"I\nhave no such tame virtues. I'll tell him to his face what he is.\nI'll lead him such a life that he shall be sick of the very name of\nnecklace.\"\n\n\"You cannot ask him to marry you.\"\n\n\"I will. What, not ask a man to keep his promise when you are engaged\nto him? I am not going to be such a girl as that.\"\n\n\"Do you love him, then?\"\n\n\"Love him! I hate him. I always despised him, and now I hate him.\"\n\n\"And yet you would marry him?\"\n\n\"Not for worlds, Frank. No. Because you advised me, I thought that\nI would do so. Yes, you did, Frank. But for you I would never have\ndreamed of taking him. You know, Frank, how it was,--when you told me\nof him and wouldn't come to me yourself.\" Now again she was sitting\nclose to him and had her hand upon his arm. \"No, Frank; even to\nplease you I could not marry him now. But I'll tell you what I'll do.\nHe shall ask me again. In spite of those idiots at Richmond he shall\nkneel at my feet,--necklace or no necklace; and then,--then I'll tell\nhim what I think of him. Marry him! I would not touch him with a pair\nof tongs.\" As she said this, she was holding her cousin fast by the\nhand.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nShowing What Frank Greystock Thought About Marriage\n\n\nIt had not been much after noon when Frank Greystock reached Portray\nCastle, and it was very nearly five when he left it. Of course he had\nlunched with the two ladies, and as the conversation before lunch had\nbeen long and interesting, they did not sit down till near three.\nThen Lizzie had taken him out to show him the grounds and garden, and\nthey had clambered together down to the sea-beach. \"Leave me here,\"\nshe had said, when he insisted on going because of his friend at the\nCottage. When he suggested that she would want help to climb back up\nthe rocks to the castle, she shook her head, as though her heart was\ntoo full to admit of a consideration so trifling. \"My thoughts flow\nmore freely here with the surge of the water in my ears, than they\nwill with that old woman droning to me. I come here often, and know\nevery rock and every stone.\" That was not exactly true, as she had\nnever been down but once before. \"You mean to come again?\" He told\nher that of course he should come again. \"I will name neither day nor\nhour. I have nothing to take me away. If I am not at the castle I\nshall be at this spot. Good-bye, Frank.\" He took her in his arms and\nkissed her,--of course as a brother; and then he clambered up, got on\nhis pony, and rode away. \"I dinna ken just what to mak' o' him,\" said\nGowran to his wife. \"May be he is her coosin; but coosins are nae\nthat sib that a weedow is to be hailed aboot jist ane as though she\nwere ony quean at a fair.\" From which it may be inferred that Mr.\nGowran had watched the pair as they were descending together towards\nthe shore.\n\nFrank had so much to think of, riding back to the Cottage, that when\nhe came to the gap, instead of turning round along the wall down the\nvalley, he took the track right on across the mountain and lost his\nway. He had meant to be back at the Cottage by three or four, and yet\nhad made his visit to the castle so long, that without any losing of\nhis way he could not have been there before seven. As it was, when\nthat hour arrived, he was up on the top of a hill, and could again\nsee Portray Castle clustering down close upon the sea, and the thin\nbelt of trees, and the shining water beyond;--but of the road to the\nCottage he knew nothing. For a moment he thought of returning to\nPortray, till he had taught himself to perceive that the distance was\nmuch greater than it had been from the spot at which he had first\nseen the castle in the morning;--and then he turned his pony round\nand descended on the other side.\n\nHis mind was very full of Lizzie Eustace, and full also of Lucy\nMorris. If it were to be asserted here that a young man may be\nperfectly true to a first young woman while he is falling in love\nwith a second, the readers of this story would probably be offended.\nBut undoubtedly many men believe themselves to be quite true while\nundergoing this process, and many young women expect nothing else\nfrom their lovers. If only he will come right at last, they are\ncontented. And if he don't come right at all,--it is the way of the\nworld, and the game has to be played over again. Lucy Morris, no\ndoubt, had lived a life too retired for the learning of such useful\nforbearance, but Frank Greystock was quite a proficient. He still\nconsidered himself to be true to Lucy Morris, with a truth seldom\nfound in this degenerate age,--with a truth to which he intended to\nsacrifice some of the brightest hopes of his life,--with a truth\nwhich, after much thought, he had generously preferred to his\nambition. Perhaps there was found some shade of regret to tinge the\nmerit which he assumed on this head, in respect of the bright things\nwhich it would be necessary that he should abandon; but, if so, the\nfeeling only assisted him in defending his present conduct from any\naspersions his conscience might bring against it. He intended to\nmarry Lucy Morris,--without a shilling, without position, a girl who\nhad earned her bread as a governess, simply because he loved her.\nIt was a wonder to himself that he, a lawyer, a man of the world, a\nmember of Parliament, one who had been steeped up to his shoulders in\nthe ways of the world, should still be so pure as to be capable of\nsuch a sacrifice. But it was so; and the sacrifice would undoubtedly\nbe made,--some day. It would be absurd in one conscious of such high\nmerit to be afraid of the ordinary social incidents of life. It is\nthe debauched broken drunkard who should become a teetotaller, and\nnot the healthy hard-working father of a family who never drinks a\ndrop of wine till dinner-time. He need not be afraid of a glass of\nchampagne when, on a chance occasion, he goes to a picnic. Frank\nGreystock was now going to his picnic; and, though he meant to be\ntrue to Lucy Morris, he had enjoyed his glass of champagne with\nLizzie Eustace under the rocks. He was thinking a good deal of his\nchampagne when he lost his way.\n\nWhat a wonderful woman was his cousin Lizzie;--and so unlike any\nother girl he had ever seen! How full she was of energy, how\ncourageous, and, then, how beautiful! No doubt her special treatment\nof him was sheer flattery. He told himself that it was so. But, after\nall, flattery is agreeable. That she did like him better than anybody\nelse was probable. He could have no feeling of the injustice he\nmight do to the heart of a woman who at the very moment that she was\nexpressing her partiality for him, was also expressing her anger that\nanother man would not consent to marry her. And then women who have\nhad one husband already are not like young girls in respect to their\nhearts. So at least thought Frank Greystock. Then he remembered the\ntime at which he had intended to ask Lizzie to be his wife,--the very\nday on which he would have done so had he been able to get away from\nthat early division at the House,--and he asked himself whether he\nfelt any regret on that score. It would have been very nice to come\ndown to Portray Castle as to his own mansion after the work of the\ncourts and of the session. Had Lizzie become his wife, her fortune\nwould have helped him to the very highest steps beneath the throne.\nAt present he was almost nobody;--because he was so poor, and in\ndebt. It was so, undoubtedly; but what did all that matter in\ncomparison with the love of Lucy Morris? A man is bound to be true.\nAnd he would be true. Only, as a matter of course, Lucy must wait.\n\nWhen he had first kissed his cousin up in London, she suggested that\nthe kiss was given as by a brother, and asserted that it was accepted\nas by a sister. He had not demurred, having been allowed the kiss.\nNothing of the kind had been said under the rocks to-day;--but then\nthat fraternal arrangement, when once made and accepted, remains,\nno doubt, in force for a long time. He did like his cousin Lizzie.\nHe liked to feel that he could be her friend, with the power of\ndomineering over her. She, also, was fond of her own way, and loved\nto domineer herself; but the moment that he suggested to her that\nthere might be a quarrel, she was reduced to a prayer that he\nwould not desert her. Such a friendship has charms for a young man,\nespecially if the lady be pretty. As to Lizzie's prettiness, no man\nor woman could entertain a doubt. And she had a way of making the\nmost of herself, which it was very hard to resist. Some young women,\nwhen they clamber over rocks, are awkward, heavy, unattractive, and\ntroublesome. But Lizzie had at one moment touched him as a fairy\nmight have done; had sprung at another from stone to stone, requiring\nno help; and then, on a sudden, had become so powerless that he had\nbeen forced almost to carry her in his arms. That, probably, must\nhave been the moment which induced Mr. Gowran to liken her to a quean\nat a fair.\n\nBut, undoubtedly, there might be trouble. Frank was sufficiently\nexperienced in the ways of the world to know that trouble would\nsometimes come from young ladies who treat young men like their\nbrothers, when those young men are engaged to other young ladies.\nThe other young ladies are apt to disapprove of brothers who are\nnot brothers by absolute right of birth. He knew also that all the\ncircumstances of his cousin's position would make it expedient that\nshe should marry a second husband. As he could not be that second\nhusband,--that matter was settled, whether for good or bad,--was he\nnot creating trouble, both for her and for himself? Then there arose\nin his mind a feeling, very strange, but by no means uncommon, that\nprudence on his part would be mean, because by such prudence he would\nbe securing safety for himself as well as for her. What he was doing\nwas not only imprudent,--but wrong also. He knew that it was so. But\nLizzie Eustace was a pretty young woman; and, when a pretty young\nwoman is in the case, a man is bound to think neither of what is\nprudent, nor of what is right. Such was--perhaps his instinct rather\nthan his theory. For her sake, if not for his own, he should have\nabstained. She was his cousin, and was so placed in the world as\nspecially to require some strong hand to help her. He knew her to be,\nin truth, heartless, false, and greedy; but she had so lived that\neven yet her future life might be successful. He had called himself\nher friend as well as cousin, and was bound to protect her from\nevil, if protection were possible. But he was adding to all her\ndifficulties, because she pretended to be in love with him. He knew\nthat it was pretence; and yet, because she was pretty, and because he\nwas a man, he could not save her from herself. \"It doesn't do to be\nwiser than other men,\" he said to himself as he looked round about on\nthe bare hill-side. In the meantime he had altogether lost his way.\n\nIt was between nine and ten when he reached the Cottage. \"Of course\nyou have dined?\" said Herriot.\n\n\"Not a bit of it. I left before five, being sure that I could get\nhere in an hour and a half. I have been riding up and down these\ndreary hills for nearly five hours. You have dined?\"\n\n\"There was a neck of mutton and a chicken. She said the neck of\nmutton would keep hot best, so I took the chicken. I hope you like\nlukewarm neck of mutton?\"\n\n\"I'm hungry enough to eat anything;--not but what I had a first-rate\nluncheon. What have you done all day?\"\n\n\"Stone and Toddy,\" said Herriot.\n\n\"Stick to that. If anything can pull you through, Stone and Toddy\nwill. I lived upon them for two years.\"\n\n\"Stone and Toddy,--with a little tobacco, have been all my comfort.\nI began, however, by sleeping for a few hours. Then I went upon the\nmountains.\"\n\n\"Did you take a gun?\"\n\n\"I took it out of the case, but it didn't come right, and so I left\nit. A man came to me and said he was the keeper.\"\n\n\"He'd have put the gun right for you.\"\n\n\"I was too bashful for that. I persuaded him that I wanted to go out\nalone and see what birds there were, and at last I induced him to\nstay here with the old woman. He's to be at the Cottage at nine\nto-morrow. I hope that is all right.\"\n\nIn the evening, as they smoked and drank whiskey and water,--probably\nsupposing that to be correct in Ayrshire,--they were led on by the\ncombined warmth of the spirit, the tobacco, and their friendship, to\ntalk about women. Frank, some month or six weeks since, in a moment\nof soft confidence, had told his friend of his engagement with Lucy\nMorris. Of Lizzie Eustace he had spoken only as of a cousin whose\ninterests were dear to him. Her engagement with Lord Fawn was known\nto all London, and was, therefore, known to Arthur Herriot. Some\ndistant rumour, however, had reached him that the course of true-love\nwas not running quite smooth, and therefore on that subject he would\nnot speak, at any rate till Greystock should first mention it. \"How\nodd it is to find two women living all alone in a great house like\nthat,\" Frank had said.\n\n\"Because so few women have the means to live in large houses, unless\nthey live with fathers or husbands.\"\n\n\"The truth is,\" said Frank, \"that women don't do well alone. There is\nalways a savour of misfortune,--or, at least, of melancholy,--about\na household which has no man to look after it. With us, generally,\nold maids don't keep houses, and widows marry again. No doubt it\nwas an unconscious appreciation of this feeling which brought about\nthe burning of Indian widows. There is an unfitness in women for\nsolitude. A female Prometheus, even without a vulture, would indicate\ncruelty worse even than Jove's. A woman should marry,--once, twice,\nand thrice if necessary.\"\n\n\"Women can't marry without men to marry them.\"\n\nFrank Greystock filled his pipe as he went on with his lecture. \"That\nidea as to the greater number of women is all nonsense. Of course we\nare speaking of our own kind of men and women, and the disproportion\nof the numbers in so small a division of the population amounts to\nnothing. We have no statistics to tell us whether there be any such\ndisproportion in classes where men do not die early from overwork.\"\n\n\"More females are born than males.\"\n\n\"That's more than I know. As one of the legislators of the country I\nam prepared to state that statistics are always false. What we have\nto do is to induce men to marry. We can't do it by statute.\"\n\n\"No, thank God.\"\n\n\"Nor yet by fashion.\"\n\n\"Fashion seems to be going the other way,\" said Herriot.\n\n\"It can be only done by education and conscience. Take men of forty\nall round,--men of our own class,--you believe that the married men\nare happier than the unmarried? I want an answer, you know, just for\nthe sake of the argument.\"\n\n\"I think the married men are the happier. But you speak as the fox\nwho had lost his tail;--or, at any rate, as a fox in the act of\nlosing it.\"\n\n\"Never mind my tail. If morality in life and enlarged affections are\nconducive to happiness it must be so.\"\n\n\"Short commons and unpaid bills are conducive to misery. That's what\nI should say if I wanted to oppose you.\"\n\n\"I never came across a man willing to speak the truth who did not\nadmit that, in the long run, married men are the happier. As regards\nwomen, there isn't even ground for an argument. And yet men don't\nmarry.\"\n\n\"They can't.\"\n\n\"You mean there isn't food enough in the world.\"\n\n\"The man fears that he won't get enough of what there is for his wife\nand family.\"\n\n\"The labourer with twelve shillings a week has no such fear. And\nif he did marry, the food would come. It isn't that. The man is\nunconscientious and ignorant as to the sources of true happiness,\nand won't submit himself to cold mutton and three clean shirts a\nweek,--not because he dislikes mutton and dirty linen himself,--but\nbecause the world says they are vulgar. That's the feeling that keeps\nyou from marrying, Herriot.\"\n\n\"As for me,\" said Herriot, \"I regard myself as so placed that I\ndo not dare to think of a young woman of my own rank except as a\ncreature that must be foreign to me. I cannot make such a one my\nfriend as I would a man, because I should be in love with her at\nonce. And I do not dare to be in love because I would not see a\nwife and children starve. I regard my position as one of enforced\nmonasticism, and myself as a monk under the cruellest compulsion. I\noften wish that I had been brought up as a journeyman hatter.\"\n\n\"Why a hatter?\"\n\n\"I'm told it's an active sort of life. You're fast asleep, and I\nwas just now, when you were preaching. We'd better go to bed. Nine\no'clock for breakfast, I suppose?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nMr. Dove's Opinion\n\n\nMr. Thomas Dove, familiarly known among club-men, attorneys' clerks,\nand, perhaps, even among judges when very far from their seats of\njudgment, as Turtle Dove, was a counsel learned in the law. He was a\ncounsel so learned in the law, that there was no question within the\nlimits of an attorney's capability of putting to him, that he could\nnot answer with the aid of his books. And when he had once given\nan opinion, all Westminster could not move him from it,--nor could\nChancery Lane and Lincoln's Inn and the Temple added to Westminster.\nWhen Mr. Dove had once been positive, no man on earth was more\npositive. It behoved him, therefore, to be right when he was\npositive; and though whether wrong or right he was equally stubborn,\nit must be acknowledged that he was seldom proved to be wrong.\nConsequently the attorneys believed in him, and he prospered. He was\na thin man, over fifty years of age, very full of scorn and wrath,\nimpatient of a fool, and thinking most men to be fools; afraid of\nnothing on earth,--and, so his enemies said, of nothing elsewhere;\neaten up by conceit; fond of law, but fonder, perhaps, of dominion;\nsoft as milk to those who acknowledged his power, but a tyrant\nto all who contested it; conscientious, thoughtful, sarcastic,\nbright-witted, and laborious. He was a man who never spared himself.\nIf he had a case in hand, though the interest to himself in it was\nalmost nothing, he would rob himself of rest for a week should a\npoint arise which required such labour. It was the theory of Mr.\nDove's life that he would never be beaten. Perhaps it was some fear\nin this respect that had kept him from Parliament and confined him to\nthe courts and the company of attorneys. He was, in truth, a married\nman with a family; but they who knew him as the terror of opponents\nand as the divulger of legal opinions, heard nothing of his wife and\nchildren. He kept all such matters quite to himself, and was not\ngiven to much social intercourse with those among whom his work lay.\nOut at Streatham, where he lived, Mrs. Dove probably had her circle\nof acquaintance;--but Mr. Dove's domestic life and his forensic life\nwere kept quite separate.\n\nAt the present moment Mr. Dove is interesting to us solely as being\nthe learned counsel in whom Mr. Camperdown trusted,--to whom Mr.\nCamperdown was willing to trust for an opinion in so grave a matter\nas that of the Eustace diamonds. A case was made out and submitted\nto Mr. Dove immediately after that scene on the pavement in Mount\nStreet, at which Mr. Camperdown had endeavoured to induce Lizzie to\ngive up the necklace; and the following is the opinion which Mr. Dove\ngave:--\n\n\n   There is much error about heirlooms. Many think that\n   any chattel may be made an heirloom by any owner of it.\n   This is not the case. The law, however, does recognise\n   heirlooms;--as to which the Exors. or Admors. are excluded\n   in favour of the Successor; and when there are such\n   heirlooms they go to the heir by special custom. Any\n   devise of an heirloom is necessarily void, for the will\n   takes place after death, and the heirloom is already\n   vested in the heir by custom. We have it from Littleton,\n   that law prefers custom to devise.\n\n   Brooke says, that the best thing of every sort may be an\n   heirloom,--such as the best bed, the best table, the best\n   pot or pan.\n\n   Coke says, that heirlooms are so by custom, and not by\n   law.\n\n   Spelman says, in defining an heirloom, that it may be\n   \"Omne utensil robustius;\" which would exclude a necklace.\n\n   In the \"Termes de Ley,\" it is defined as \"Ascun parcel des\n   ustensiles.\"\n\n   We are told in \"Coke upon Littleton,\" that Crown jewels\n   are heirlooms, which decision,--as far as it goes,--denies\n   the right to other jewels.\n\n   Certain chattels may undoubtedly be held and claimed as\n   being in the nature of heirlooms,--as swords, pennons of\n   honour, garter and collar of S. S. See case of the Earl\n   of Northumberland; and that of the Pusey horn,--Pusey v.\n   Pusey. The journals of the House of Lords, delivered\n   officially to peers, may be so claimed. See Upton v. Lord\n   Ferrers.\n\n   A devisor may clearly devise or limit the possession\n   of chattels, making them inalienable by devisees in\n   succession. But in such cases they will become the\n   absolute possession of the first person seized in\n   tail,--even though an infant, and in case of death without\n   will, would go to the Exors. Such arrangement, therefore,\n   can only hold good for lives in existence and for 21 years\n   afterwards. Chattels so secured would not be heirlooms.\n   See Carr v. Lord Errol, 14 Vesey, and Rowland v. Morgan.\n\n   Lord Eldon remarks, that such chattels held in families\n   are \"rather favourites of the court.\" This was in the\n   Ormonde case. Executors, therefore, even when setting\n   aside any claim as for heirlooms, ought not to apply such\n   property in payment of debts unless obliged.\n\n   The law allows of claims for paraphernalia for widows,\n   and, having adjusted such claims, seems to show that the\n   claim may be limited.\n\n   If a man deliver cloth to his wife, and die, she shall\n   have it, though she had not fashioned it into the garment\n   intended.\n\n   Pearls and jewels, even though only worn on state\n   occasions, may go to the widow as paraphernalia,--but\n   with a limit. In the case of Lady Douglas, she being the\n   daughter of an Irish Earl and widow of the King's Sergeant\n   (temp. Car. I.), it was held that \u00c2\u00a3370 was not too much,\n   and she was allowed a diamond and a pearl chain to that\n   value.\n\n   In 1674, Lord Keeper Finch declared that he would never\n   allow paraphernalia, except to the widow of a nobleman.\n\n   But in 1721 Lord Macclesfield gave Mistress Tipping\n   paraphernalia to the value of \u00c2\u00a3200,--whether so persuaded\n   by law and precedent, or otherwise, may be uncertain.\n\n   Lord Talbot allowed a gold watch as paraphernalia.\n\n   Lord Hardwicke went much further, and decided that Mrs.\n   Northey was entitled to wear jewels to the value of\n   \u00c2\u00a33000,--saying that value made no difference; but seems to\n   have limited the nature of her possession in the jewels\n   by declaring her to be entitled to wear them only when\n   full-dressed.\n\n   It is, I think, clear that the Eustace estate cannot claim\n   the jewels as an heirloom. They are last mentioned, and,\n   as far as I know, only mentioned as an heirloom in the\n   will of the great-grandfather of the present baronet,--if\n   these be the diamonds then named by him. As such, he could\n   not have devised them to the present claimant, as he died\n   in 1820, and the present claimant is not yet two years\n   old.\n\n   Whether the widow could claim them as paraphernalia is\n   more doubtful. I do not know that Lord Hardwicke's ruling\n   would decide the case; but, if so, she would, I think,\n   be debarred from selling, as he limits the use of jewels\n   of lesser value than these to the wearing of them when\n   full-dressed. The use being limited, possession with power\n   of alienation cannot be intended.\n\n   The lady's claim to them as a gift from her husband\n   amounts to nothing. If they are not hers by will,--and it\n   seems that they are not so,--she can only hold them as\n   paraphernalia belonging to her station.\n\n   I presume it to be capable of proof that the diamonds were\n   not in Scotland when Sir Florian made his will or when he\n   died. The former fact might be used as tending to show his\n   intention when the will was made. I understand that he did\n   leave to his widow by will all the chattels in Portray\n   Castle.\n\n   J. D.\n\n   15 August, 18--.\n\n\nWhen Mr. Camperdown had thrice read this opinion, he sat in his chair\nan unhappy old man. It was undoubtedly the case that he had been\na lawyer for upwards of forty years, and had always believed that\nany gentleman could make any article of value an heirloom in his\nfamily. The title-deeds of vast estates had been confided to his\nkeeping, and he had had much to do with property of every kind;\nand now he was told that, in reference to property of a certain\ndescription,--property which, by its nature, could only belong to\nsuch as they who were his clients,--he had been long without any\nknowledge whatsoever. He had called this necklace an heirloom to John\nEustace above a score of times; and now he was told by Mr. Dove not\nonly that the necklace was not an heirloom, but that it couldn't have\nbeen an heirloom. He was a man who trusted much in a barrister,--as\nwas natural with an attorney; but he was now almost inclined to doubt\nMr. Dove. And he was hardly more at ease in regard to the other\nclauses of the opinion. Not only could not the estate claim the\nnecklace as an heirloom, but that greedy siren, that heartless snake,\nthat harpy of a widow,--for it was thus that Mr. Camperdown in his\nsolitude spoke to himself of poor Lizzie, perhaps throwing in a\nharder word or two,--that female swindler could claim it\nas--paraphernalia!\n\nThere was a crumb of comfort for him in the thought that he could\nforce her to claim that privilege from a decision of the Court of\nQueen's Bench, and that her greed would be exposed should she do so.\nAnd she could be prevented from selling the diamonds. Mr. Dove seemed\nto make that quite clear. But then there came that other question, as\nto the inheritance of the property under the husband's will. That Sir\nFlorian had not intended that she should inherit the necklace, Mr.\nCamperdown was quite certain. On that point he suffered no doubt.\nBut would he be able to prove that the diamonds had never been in\nScotland since Sir Florian's marriage? He had traced their history\nfrom that date with all the diligence he could use, and he thought\nthat he knew it. But it might be doubtful whether he could prove it.\nLady Eustace had first stated,--had so stated before she had learned\nthe importance of any other statement,--that Sir Florian had given\nher the diamonds in London, as they passed through London from\nScotland to Italy, and that she had carried them thence to Naples,\nwhere Sir Florian had died. If this were so, they could not have\nbeen at Portray Castle till she took them there as a widow, and they\nwould undoubtedly be regarded as a portion of that property which Sir\nFlorian habitually kept in London. That this was so Mr. Camperdown\nentertained no doubt. But now the widow alleged that Sir Florian\nhad given the necklace to her in Scotland, whither they had gone\nimmediately after their marriage, and that she herself had brought\nthem up to London. They had been married on the 5th of September; and\nby the jewellers' books it was hard to tell whether the trinket had\nbeen given up to Sir Florian on the 4th or 24th of September. On the\n24th Sir Florian and his young bride had undoubtedly been in London.\nMr. Camperdown anathematised the carelessness of everybody connected\nwith Messrs. Garnett's establishment. \"Those sort of people have no\nmore idea of accuracy than--than--\" than he had had of heirlooms, his\nconscience whispered to him, filling up the blank.\n\nNevertheless he thought he could prove that the necklace was first\nput into Lizzie's hands in London. The middle-aged and very discreet\nman at Messrs. Garnett's, who had given up the jewel-case to Sir\nFlorian, was sure that he had known Sir Florian to be a married man\nwhen he did so. The lady's maid who had been in Scotland with Lady\nEustace, and who was now living in Turin, having married a courier,\nhad given evidence before an Italian man of law, stating that she\nhad never seen the necklace till she came to London. There were,\nmoreover, the probabilities of the case. Was it likely that Sir\nFlorian should take such a thing down in his pocket to Scotland? And\nthere was the statement as first made by Lady Eustace herself to her\ncousin Frank, repeated by him to John Eustace, and not to be denied\nby any one. It was all very well for her now to say that she had\nforgotten; but would any one believe that on such a subject she could\nforget?\n\nBut still the whole thing was very uncomfortable. Mr. Dove's opinion,\nif seen by Lady Eustace and her friends, would rather fortify\nthem than frighten them. Were she once to get hold of that word\nparaphernalia, it would be as a tower of strength to her. Mr.\nCamperdown specially felt this,--that whereas he had hitherto\nbelieved that no respectable attorney would take up such a case as\nthat of Lady Eustace, he could not now but confess to himself that\nany lawyer seeing Mr. Dove's opinion would be justified in taking\nit up. And yet he was as certain as ever that the woman was robbing\nthe estate which it was his duty to guard, and that should he cease\nto be active in the matter, the necklace would be broken up and the\nproperty sold and scattered before a year was out, and then the woman\nwould have got the better of him! \"She shall find that we have not\ndone with her yet,\" he said to himself, as he wrote a line to John\nEustace.\n\nBut John Eustace was out of town, as a matter of course;--and on the\nnext day Mr. Camperdown himself went down and joined his wife and\nfamily at a little cottage which he had at Dawlish. The necklace,\nhowever, interfered much with his holiday.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\nMr. Gowran Is Very Funny\n\n\nFrank Greystock certainly went over to Portray too often,--so often\nthat the pony was proved to be quite necessary. Miss Macnulty held\nher tongue and was gloomy,--believing that Lady Eustace was still\nengaged to Lord Fawn, and feeling that in that case there should not\nbe so many visits to the rocks. Mr. Gowran was very attentive, and\ncould tell on any day, to five minutes, how long the two cousins were\nsitting together on the sea-shore. Arthur Herriot, who cared nothing\nfor Lady Eustace, but who knew that his friend had promised to marry\nLucy Morris, was inclined to be serious on the subject; but,--as is\nalways the case with men,--was not willing to speak about it.\n\nOnce, and once only, the two men dined together at the castle,--for\nthe doing of which it was necessary that a gig should be hired all\nthe way from Prestwick. Herriot had not been anxious to go over,\nalleging various excuses,--the absence of dress clothes, the calls of\nStone and Toddy, his bashfulness, and the absurdity of paying fifteen\nshillings for a gig. But he went at last, constrained by his friend,\nand a very dull evening he passed. Lizzie was quite unlike her usual\nself,--was silent, grave, and solemnly courteous; Miss Macnulty\nhad not a word to say for herself; and even Frank was dull. Arthur\nHerriot had not tried to exert himself, and the dinner had been a\nfailure.\n\n\"You don't think much of my cousin, I daresay,\" said Frank, as they\nwere driving back.\n\n\"She is a very pretty woman.\"\n\n\"And I should say that she does not think much of you.\"\n\n\"Probably not.\"\n\n\"Why on earth wouldn't you speak to her? I went on making speeches to\nMiss Macnulty on purpose to give you a chance. Lizzie generally talks\nabout as well as any young woman I know; but you had not a word to\nsay to her, nor she to you.\"\n\n\"Because you devoted yourself to Miss Mac--whatever her name is.\"\n\n\"That's nonsense,\" said Frank; \"Lizzie and I are more like brother\nand sister than anything else. She has no one else belonging to her,\nand she has to come to me for advice, and all that sort of thing. I\nwanted you to like her.\"\n\n\"I never like people, and people never like me. There is an old\nsaying that you should know a man seven years before you poke his\nfire. I want to know persons seven years before I can ask them how\nthey do. To take me out to dine in this way was of all things the\nmost hopeless.\"\n\n\"But you do dine out,--in London.\"\n\n\"That's different. There's a certain routine of conversation going,\nand one falls into it. At such affairs as that this evening one\nhas to be intimate, or it is a bore. I don't mean to say anything\nagainst Lady Eustace. Her beauty is undeniable, and I don't doubt her\ncleverness.\"\n\n\"She is sometimes too clever,\" said Frank.\n\n\"I hope she is not becoming too clever for you. You've got to\nremember that you're due elsewhere;--eh, old fellow?\" This was the\nfirst word that Herriot had said on the subject, and to that word\nFrank Greystock made no answer. But it had its effect, as also did\nthe gloomy looks of Miss Macnulty, and the not unobserved presence of\nMr. Andy Gowran on various occasions.\n\nBetween them they shot more grouse,--so the keeper swore,--than\nhad ever been shot on these mountains before. Herriot absolutely\nkilled one or two himself, to his own great delight, and Frank, who\nwas fairly skilful, would get four or five in a day. There were\nexcursions to be made, and the air of the hills was in itself a treat\nto both of them. Though Greystock was so often away at the castle,\nHerriot did not find the time hang heavily on his hands, and was\nsorry when his fortnight was over. \"I think I shall stay a couple of\ndays longer,\" Frank said, when Herriot spoke of their return. \"The\ntruth is I must see Lizzie again. She is bothered by business, and I\nhave to see her about a letter that came this morning. You needn't\npull such a long face. There's nothing of the kind you're thinking\nof.\"\n\n\"I thought so much of what you once said to me about another girl\nthat I hope she at any rate may never be in trouble.\"\n\n\"I hope she never may,--on my account,\" said Frank. \"And what\ntroubles she may have,--as life will be troublesome, I trust that I\nmay share and lessen.\"\n\nOn that evening Herriot went, and on the next morning Frank Greystock\nagain rode over to Portray Castle; but when he was alone after\nHerriot's departure, he wrote a letter to Lucy Morris. He had\nexpressed a hope that he might never be a cause of trouble to Lucy\nMorris, and he knew that his silence would trouble her. There could\nbe no human being less inclined to be suspicious than Lucy Morris. Of\nthat Frank was sure. But there had been an express stipulation with\nLady Fawn that she should be allowed to receive letters from him, and\nshe would naturally be vexed when he did not write to her. So he\nwrote.\n\n\n   Portray Cottage, 3 Sept., 18--.\n\n   DEAREST LUCY,\n\n   We have been here for a fortnight, shooting grouse,\n   wandering about the mountains, and going to sleep on the\n   hill-sides. You will say that there never was a time so\n   fit for the writing of letters, but that will be because\n   you have not learned yet that the idler people are,\n   the more inclined they are to be idle. We hear of Lord\n   Chancellors writing letters to their mothers every day\n   of their lives; but men who have nothing on earth to do\n   cannot bring themselves to face a sheet of paper. I would\n   promise that when I am Lord Chancellor I would write to\n   you every day, were it not that when that time comes I\n   shall hope to be always with you.\n\n   And, in truth, I have had to pay constant visits to my\n   cousin, who lives in a big castle on the sea-side, ten\n   miles from here, over the mountains, and who is in a\n   peck of troubles;--in spite of her prosperity one of\n   the unhappiest women, I should say, that you could meet\n   anywhere. You know so much of her affairs that, without\n   breach of trust, I may say so much. I wish she had a\n   father or a brother to manage her matters for her; but\n   she has none, and I cannot desert her. Your Lord Fawn is\n   behaving badly to her; and so, as far as I can see, are\n   the people who manage the Eustace property. Lizzie, as you\n   know, is not the most tractable of women, and altogether\n   I have more to do in the matter than I like. Riding ten\n   miles backwards and forwards so often over the same route\n   on a little pony is not good fun, but I am almost glad the\n   distance is not less. Otherwise I might have been always\n   there. I know you don't quite like Lizzie, but she is to\n   be pitied.\n\n   I go up to London on Friday, but shall only be there for\n   one or two days,--that is, for one night. I go almost\n   entirely on her business, and must, I fear, be here again,\n   or at the castle, before I can settle myself either\n   for work or happiness. On Sunday night I go down to\n   Bobsborough,--where, indeed, I ought to have been earlier.\n   I fear I cannot go to Richmond on the Saturday, and on the\n   Sunday Lady Fawn would hardly make me welcome. I shall be\n   at Bobsborough for about three weeks, and there, if you\n   have commands to give, I will obey them.\n\n   I may, however, tell you the truth at once,--though it\n   is a truth you must keep very much to yourself. In the\n   position in which I now stand as to Lord Fawn,--being\n   absolutely forced to quarrel with him on Lizzie's\n   behalf,--Lady Fawn could hardly receive me with comfort\n   to herself. She is the best of women; and, as she is your\n   dear friend, nothing is further from me than any idea of\n   quarrelling with her; but of course she takes her son's\n   part, and I hardly know how all allusion to the subject\n   could be avoided.\n\n   This, however, dearest, need ruffle no feather between you\n   and me, who love each other better than we love either the\n   Fawns or the Lizzies. Let me find a line at my chambers to\n   say that it is so, and always shall be so.\n\n   God bless my own darling,\n   Ever and always your own,\n\n   F. G.\n\n\nOn the following day he rode over to the castle. He had received a\nletter from John Eustace, who had found himself forced to run up to\nLondon to meet Mr. Camperdown. The lawyer had thought to postpone\nfurther consideration of the whole matter till he and everybody\nelse would be naturally in London,--till November that might be, or,\nperhaps, even till after Christmas. But his mind was ill at ease; and\nhe knew that so much might be done with the diamonds in four months!\nThey might even now be in the hands of some Benjamin or of some\nHarter, and it might soon be beyond the power either of lawyers\nor of policemen to trace them. He therefore went up from Dawlish\nand persuaded John Eustace to come from Yorkshire. It was a great\nnuisance, and Eustace freely anathematised the necklace. \"If only\nsome one would steal it, so that we might hear no more of the thing!\"\nhe said. But, as Mr. Camperdown had frequently remarked, the value\nwas too great for trifling, and Eustace went up to London. Mr.\nCamperdown put into his hands the Turtle Dove's opinion, explaining\nthat it was by no means expedient that it should be shown to the\nother party. Eustace thought that the opinion should be common to\nthem all. \"We pay for it,\" said Mr. Camperdown, \"and they can get\ntheir opinion from any other barrister if they please.\" But what was\nto be done? Eustace declared that as to the present whereabouts of\nthe necklace, he did not in the least doubt that he could get the\ntruth from Frank Greystock. He therefore wrote to Greystock, and with\nthat letter in his pocket, Frank rode over to the castle for the last\ntime.\n\nHe, too, was heartily sick of the necklace;--but unfortunately he was\nnot equally sick of her who held it in possession. And he was, too,\nbetter alive to the importance of the value of the trinket than John\nEustace, though not so keenly as was Mr. Camperdown. Lady Eustace was\nout somewhere among the cliffs, the servant said. He regretted this\nas he followed her, but he was obliged to follow her. Half way down\nto the sea-shore, much below the knob on which she had attempted to\nsit with her Shelley, but yet not below the need of assistance, he\nfound her seated in a little ravine. \"I knew you would come,\" she\nsaid. Of course she had known that he would come. She did not rise,\nor even give him her hand, but there was a spot close beside her on\nwhich it was to be presumed that he would seat himself. She had a\nvolume of Byron in her hand,--the Corsair, Lara, and the Giaour,--a\nkind of poetry which was in truth more intelligible to her than Queen\nMab. \"You go to-morrow?\"\n\n\"Yes;--I go to-morrow.\"\n\n\"And Lubin has gone?\" Arthur Herriot was Lubin.\n\n\"Lubin has gone. Though why Lubin, I cannot guess. The normal Lubin\nto me is a stupid fellow always in love. Herriot is not stupid and is\nnever in love.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, he is Lubin if I choose to call him so. Why did he\ntwiddle his thumbs instead of talking? Have you heard anything of\nLord Fawn?\"\n\n\"I have had a letter from your brother-in-law.\"\n\n\"And what is John the Just pleased to say?\"\n\n\"John the Just, which is a better name for the man than the\nother, has been called up to London, much against his will, by Mr.\nCamperdown.\"\n\n\"Who is Samuel the Unjust.\" Mr. Camperdown's name was Samuel.\n\n\"And now wants to know where this terrible necklace is at this\npresent moment.\" He paused a moment, but Lizzie did not answer him.\n\"I suppose you have no objection to telling me where it is.\"\n\n\"None in the least:--or to giving it you to keep for me, only that\nI would not so far trouble you. But I have an objection to telling\nthem. They are my enemies. Let them find out.\"\n\n\"You are wrong, Lizzie. You do not want, or at any rate should not\nwant, to have any secret in the matter.\"\n\n\"They are here,--in the castle; in the very place in which Sir\nFlorian kept them when he gave them to me. Where should my own jewels\nbe but in my own house? What does that Mr. Dove say, who was to be\nasked about them? No doubt they can pay a barrister to say anything.\"\n\n\"Lizzie, you think too hardly of people.\"\n\n\"And do not people think too hardly of me? Does not all this amount\nto an accusation against me that I am a thief? Am I not persecuted\namong them? Did not this impudent attorney stop me in the public\nstreet and accuse me of theft before my very servants? Have they not\nso far succeeded in misrepresenting me, that the very man who is\nengaged to be my husband betrays me? And now you are turning against\nme? Can you wonder that I am hard?\"\n\n\"I am not turning against you.\"\n\n\"Yes; you are. You take their part, and not mine, in everything.\nI tell you what, Frank;--I would go out in that boat that you see\nyonder, and drop the bauble into the sea, did I not know that they'd\ndrag it up again with their devilish ingenuity. If the stones would\nburn, I would burn them. But the worst of it all is, that you are\nbecoming my enemy!\" Then she burst into violent and almost hysteric\ntears.\n\n\"It will be better that you should give them into the keeping of some\none whom you can both trust, till the law has decided to whom they\nbelong.\"\n\n\"I will never give them up. What does Mr. Dove say?\"\n\n\"I have not seen what Mr. Dove says. It is clear that the necklace is\nnot an heirloom.\"\n\n\"Then how dare Mr. Camperdown say so often that it was?\"\n\n\"He said what he thought,\" pleaded Frank.\n\n\"And he is a lawyer!\"\n\n\"I am a lawyer, and I did not know what is or what is not an\nheirloom. But Mr. Dove is clearly of opinion that such a property\ncould not have been given away simply by word of mouth.\" John Eustace\nin his letter had made no allusion to that complicated question of\nparaphernalia.\n\n\"But it was,\" said Lizzie. \"Who can know but myself, when no one else\nwas present?\"\n\n\"The jewels are here now?\"\n\n\"Not in my pocket. I do not carry them about with me. They are in the\ncastle.\"\n\n\"And will they go back with you to London?\"\n\n\"Was ever lady so interrogated? I do not know yet that I shall go\nback to London. Why am I asked such questions? As to you, Frank, I\nwould tell you everything,--my whole heart, if only you cared to know\nit. But why is John Eustace to make inquiry as to personal ornaments\nwhich are my own property? If I go to London, I will take them there,\nand wear them at every house I enter. I will do so in defiance of Mr.\nCamperdown and Lord Fawn. I think, Frank, that no woman was ever so\nill-treated as I am.\"\n\nHe himself thought that she was ill-treated. She had so pleaded her\ncase, and had been so lovely in her tears and her indignation, that\nhe began to feel something like true sympathy for her cause. What\nright had he, or had Mr. Camperdown, or any one, to say that the\njewels did not belong to her? And if her claim to them was just, why\nshould she be persuaded to give up the possession of them? He knew\nwell that were she to surrender them with the idea that they should\nbe restored to her if her claim were found to be just, she would not\nget them back very soon. If once the jewels were safe, locked up in\nMr. Garnett's strong box, Mr. Camperdown would not care how long it\nmight be before a jury or a judge should have decided on the case.\nThe burthen of proof would then be thrown upon Lady Eustace. In order\nthat she might recover her own property she would have to thrust\nherself forward as a witness, and appear before the world a claimant,\ngreedy for rich ornaments. Why should he advise her to give them up?\n\"I am only thinking,\" said he, \"what may be the best for your own\npeace.\"\n\n\"Peace!\"--she exclaimed. \"How am I to have peace? Remember the\ncondition in which I find myself! Remember the manner in which that\nman is treating me, when all the world has been told of my engagement\nto him! When I think of it my heart is so bitter that I am inclined\nto throw, not the diamonds, but myself from off the rocks. All that\nremains to me is the triumph of getting the better of my enemies. Mr.\nCamperdown shall never have the diamonds. Even if they could prove\nthat they did not belong to me, they should find them--gone.\"\n\n\"I don't think they can prove it.\"\n\n\"I'll flaunt them in the eyes of all of them till they do; and\nthen--they shall be gone. And I'll have such revenge on Lord Fawn\nbefore I have done with him, that he shall know that it may be worse\nto have to fight a woman than a man. Oh, Frank, I do not think that I\nam hard by nature, but these things make a woman hard.\" As she spoke\nshe took his hand in hers, and looked up into his eyes through her\ntears. \"I know that you do not care for me, and you know how much I\ncare for you.\"\n\n\"Not care for you, Lizzie?\"\n\n\"No;--that little thing at Richmond is everything to you. She is tame\nand quiet,--a cat that will sleep on the rug before the fire, and\nyou think that she will never scratch. Do not suppose that I mean to\nabuse her. She was my dear friend before you had ever seen her. And\nmen, I know, have tastes which we women do not understand. You want\nwhat you call--repose.\"\n\n\"We seldom know what we want, I fancy. We take what the gods send\nus.\" Frank's words were perhaps more true than wise. At the present\nmoment the gods had clearly sent Lizzie Eustace to him, and unless he\ncould call up some increased strength of his own, quite independent\nof the gods,--or of what we may perhaps call chance,--he would have\nto put up with the article sent.\n\nLizzie had declared that she would not touch Lord Fawn with a pair of\ntongs, and in saying so had resolved that she could not and would not\nnow marry his lordship even were his lordship in her power. It had\nbeen decided by her as quickly as thoughts flash, but it was decided.\nShe would torture the unfortunate lord, but not torture him by\nbecoming his wife. And, so much being fixed as the stars in heaven,\nmight it be possible that she should even yet induce her cousin to\ntake the place that had been intended for Lord Fawn? After all that\nhad passed between them she need hardly hesitate to tell him of her\nlove. And with the same flashing thoughts she declared to herself\nthat she did love him, and that therefore this arrangement would be\nso much better than that other one which she had proposed to herself.\nThe reader, perhaps, by this time, has not a high opinion of Lady\nEustace, and may believe that among other drawbacks on her character\nthere is especially this,--that she was heartless. But that was\nby no means her own opinion of herself. She would have described\nherself,--and would have meant to do so with truth,--as being all\nheart. She probably thought that an over-amount of heart was the\nmalady under which she specially suffered. Her heart was overflowing\nnow towards the man who was sitting by her side. And then it would\nbe so pleasant to punish that little chit who had spurned her gift\nand had dared to call her mean! This man, too, was needy, and she was\nwealthy. Surely, were she to offer herself to him, the generosity of\nthe thing would make it noble. She was still dissolved in tears and\nwas still hysteric. \"Oh, Frank!\" she said, and threw herself upon his\nbreast.\n\nFrank Greystock felt his position to be one of intense difficulty,\nbut whether his difficulty was increased or diminished by the\nappearance of Mr. Andy Gowran's head over a rock at the entrance of\nthe little cave in which they were sitting, it might be difficult to\ndetermine. But there was the head. And it was not a head that just\npopped itself up and then retreated, as a head would do that was\ndiscovered doing that which made it ashamed of itself. The head, with\nits eyes wide open, held its own, and seemed to say,--\"Ay,--I've\ncaught you, have I?\" And the head did speak, though not exactly in\nthose words. \"Coosins!\" said the head; and then the head was wagged.\nIn the meantime Lizzie Eustace, whose back was turned to the head,\nraised her own, and looked up into Greystock's eyes for love. She\nperceived at once that something was amiss, and, starting to her\nfeet, turned quickly round. \"How dare you intrude here?\" she said to\nthe head. \"Coosins!\" replied the head, wagging itself.\n\nIt was clearly necessary that Greystock should take some steps, if\nonly with the object of proving to the impudent factotum that he was\nnot altogether overcome by the awkwardness of his position. That he\nwas a good deal annoyed, and that he felt not altogether quite equal\nto the occasion, must be acknowledged. \"What is it that the man\nwants?\" he said, glaring at the head. \"Coosins!\" said the head,\nwagging itself again. \"If you don't take yourself off, I shall have\nto thrash you,\" said Frank. \"Coosins!\" said Andy Gowran, stepping\nfrom behind the rock and showing his full figure. Andy was a man on\nthe wrong side of fifty, and therefore, on the score of age, hardly\nfit for thrashing. And he was compact, short, broad, and as hard as\nflint;--a man bad to thrash, look at it from what side you would.\n\"Coosins!\" he said yet again. \"Ye're mair couthie than coosinly, I'm\nthinking.\"\n\n\"Andy Gowran, I dismiss you from my service for your impertinence,\"\nsaid Lady Eustace.\n\n\"It's ae ane to Andy Gowran for that, my leddie. There's timber and a\nwarld o' things aboot the place as wants proteection on behalf o' the\nheir. If your leddieship is minded to be quit o' my sarvices, I'll\nfind a maister in Mr. Camperdoon, as'll nae alloo me to be thrown out\no' employ. Coosins!\"\n\n\"Walk off from this!\" said Frank Greystock, coming forward and\nputting his hand upon the man's breast. Mr. Gowran repeated the\nobjectionable word yet once again, and then retired.\n\nFrank Greystock immediately felt how very bad for him was his\nposition. For the lady, if only she could succeed in her object, the\nannoyance of the interruption would not matter much after its first\nabsurdity had been endured. When she had become the wife of Frank\nGreystock there would be nothing remarkable in the fact that she had\nbeen found sitting with him in a cavern by the sea-shore. But for\nFrank the difficulty of extricating himself from his dilemma was\ngreat, not in regard to Mr. Gowran, but in reference to his cousin\nLizzie. He might, it was true, tell her that he was engaged to Lucy\nMorris;--but then why had he not told her so before? He had not told\nher so;--nor did he tell her on this occasion. When he attempted to\nlead her away up the cliff, she insisted on being left where she was.\n\"I can find my way alone,\" she said, endeavouring to smile through\nher tears. \"The man has annoyed me by his impudence,--that is all.\nGo,--if you are going.\"\n\nOf course he was going; but he could not go without a word of\ntenderness. \"Dear, dear Lizzie,\" he said, embracing her.\n\n\"Frank, you'll be true to me?\"\n\n\"I will be true to you.\"\n\n\"Then go now,\" she said. And he went his way up the cliff, and got\nhis pony, and rode back to the cottage, very uneasy in his mind.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\nLucy Morris Misbehaves\n\n\nLucy Morris got her letter and was contented. She wanted some\ndemonstration of love from her lover, but very little sufficed for\nher comfort. With her it was almost impossible that a man should be\nloved and suspected at the same time. She could not have loved the\nman, or at any rate confessed her love, without thinking well of\nhim; and she could not think good and evil at the same time. She had\nlonged for some word from him since she last saw him; and now she had\ngot a word. She had known that he was close to his fair cousin,--the\ncousin whom she despised, and whom, with womanly instinct, she had\nalmost regarded as a rival. But to her the man had spoken out; and\nthough he was far away from her, living close to the fair cousin, she\nwould not allow a thought of trouble on that score to annoy her. He\nwas her own, and let Lizzie Eustace do her worst, he would remain her\nown. But she had longed to be told that he was thinking of her, and\nat last the letter had come. She answered it that same night with the\nsweetest, prettiest little letter, very short, full of love and full\nof confidence. Lady Fawn, she said, was the dearest of women;--but\nwhat was Lady Fawn to her, or all the Fawns, compared with her lover?\nIf he could come to Richmond without disturbance to himself, let\nhim come; but if he felt that, in the present unhappy condition of\naffairs between him and Lord Fawn, it was better that he should stay\naway, she had not a word to say in the way of urging him. To see him\nwould be a great delight. But had she not the greater delight of\nknowing that he loved her? That was quite enough to make her happy.\nThen there was a little prayer that God might bless him, and an\nassurance that she was in all things his own, own Lucy. When she was\nwriting her letter she was in all respects a happy girl.\n\nBut on the very next day there came a cloud upon her happiness,--not\nin the least, however, affecting her full confidence in her lover. It\nwas a Saturday, and Lord Fawn came down to Richmond. Lord Fawn had\nseen Mr. Greystock in London on that day, and the interview had been\nby no means pleasant to him. The Under-Secretary of State for India\nwas as dark as a November day when he reached his mother's house, and\nthere fell upon every one the unintermittent cold drizzling shower of\nhis displeasure from the moment in which he entered the house. There\nwas never much reticence among the ladies at Richmond in Lucy's\npresence, and since the completion of Lizzie's unfortunate visit to\nFawn Court, they had not hesitated to express open opinions adverse\nto the prospects of the proposed bride. Lucy herself could say but\nlittle in defence of her old friend, who had lost all claim upon\nthat friendship since the offer of the bribe had been made,--so that\nit was understood among them all that Lizzie was to be regarded as\na black sheep;--but hitherto Lord Fawn himself had concealed his\nfeelings before Lucy. Now unfortunately he spoke out, and in speaking\nwas especially bitter against Frank. \"Mr. Greystock has been most\ninsolent,\" he said as they were all sitting together in the library\nafter dinner. Lady Fawn made a sign to him and shook her head. Lucy\nfelt the hot blood fly into both her cheeks, but at the moment she\ndid not speak. Lydia Fawn put out her hand beneath the table and took\nhold of Lucy's. \"We must all remember that he is her cousin,\" said\nAugusta.\n\n\"His relationship to Lady Eustace cannot justify ungentlemanlike\nimpertinence to me,\" said Lord Fawn. \"He has dared to use words to me\nwhich would make it necessary that I should call him out, only--\"\n\n\"Frederic, you shall do nothing of the kind!\" said Lady Fawn, jumping\nup from her chair.\n\n\"Oh, Frederic, pray, pray don't!\" said Augusta, springing on to her\nbrother's shoulder.\n\n\"I am sure Frederic does not mean that,\" said Amelia.\n\n\"Only that nobody does call any body out now,\" added the pacific\nlord. \"But nothing on earth shall ever induce me to speak again to\na man who is so little like a gentleman.\" Lydia now held Lucy's\nhand still tighter, as though to prevent her rising. \"He has never\nforgiven me,\" continued Lord Fawn, \"because he was so ridiculously\nwrong about the Sawab.\"\n\n\"I am sure that had nothing to do with it,\" said Lucy.\n\n\"Miss Morris, I shall venture to hold my own opinion,\" said Lord\nFawn.\n\n\"And I shall hold mine,\" said Lucy bravely. \"The Sawab of Mygawb had\nnothing to do with what Mr. Greystock may have said or done about his\ncousin. I am quite sure of it.\"\n\n\"Lucy, you are forgetting yourself,\" said Lady Fawn.\n\n\"Lucy, dear, you shouldn't contradict my brother,\" said Augusta.\n\n\"Take my advice, Lucy, and let it pass by,\" said Amelia.\n\n\"How can I hear such things said and not notice them?\" demanded Lucy.\n\"Why does Lord Fawn say them when I am by?\"\n\nLord Fawn had now condescended to be full of wrath against his\nmother's governess. \"I suppose I may express my own opinion, Miss\nMorris, in my mother's house.\"\n\n\"And I shall express mine,\" said Lucy. \"Mr. Greystock is a gentleman.\nIf you say that he is not a gentleman, it is not true.\" Upon hearing\nthese terrible words spoken, Lord Fawn rose from his seat and slowly\nleft the room. Augusta followed him with both her arms stretched\nout. Lady Fawn covered her face with her hands, and even Amelia was\ndismayed.\n\n\"Oh, Lucy! why could you not hold your tongue?\" said Lydia.\n\n\"I won't hold my tongue!\" said Lucy, bursting out into tears. \"He is\na gentleman.\"\n\nThen there was great commotion at Fawn Court. After a few moments\nLady Fawn followed her son without having said a word to Lucy, and\nAmelia went with her. Poor Lucy was left with the younger girls, and\nwas no doubt very unhappy. But she was still indignant, and would\nyield nothing. When Georgina, the fourth daughter, pointed out to her\nthat, in accordance with all rules of good breeding, she should have\nabstained from asserting that her brother had spoken an untruth, she\nblazed up again. \"It was untrue,\" she said.\n\n\"But, Lucy, people never accuse each other of untruth. No lady should\nuse such a word to a gentleman.\"\n\n\"He should not have said so. He knows that Mr. Greystock is more to\nme than all the world.\"\n\n\"If I had a lover,\" said Nina, \"and anybody were to say a word\nagainst him, I know I'd fly at them. I don't know why Frederic is to\nhave it all his own way.\"\n\n\"Nina, you're a fool,\" said Diana.\n\n\"I do think it was very hard for Lucy to bear,\" said Lydia.\n\n\"And I won't bear it!\" exclaimed Lucy. \"To think that Mr. Greystock\nshould be so mean as to bear malice about a thing like that wild\nIndian because he takes his own cousin's part! Of course I'd better\ngo away. You all think that Mr. Greystock is an enemy now; but he\nnever can be an enemy to me.\"\n\n\"We think that Lady Eustace is an enemy,\" said Cecilia, \"and a very\nnasty enemy, too.\"\n\n\"I did not say a word about Lady Eustace,\" said Lucy. \"But Mr.\nGreystock is a gentleman.\"\n\nAbout an hour after this Lady Fawn sent for Lucy, and the two were\ncloseted together for a long time. Lord Fawn was very angry, and had\nhitherto altogether declined to overlook the insult offered. \"I am\nbound to tell you,\" declared Lady Fawn, with much emphasis, \"that\nnothing can justify you in having accused Lord Fawn of telling an\nuntruth. Of course, I was sorry that Mr. Greystock's name should have\nbeen mentioned in your presence; but as it was mentioned, you should\nhave borne what was said with patience.\"\n\n\"I couldn't be patient, Lady Fawn.\"\n\n\"That is what wicked people say when they commit murder, and then\nthey are hung for it.\"\n\n\"I'll go away, Lady Fawn--\"\n\n\"That is ungrateful, my dear. You know that I don't wish you to go\naway. But if you behave badly, of course I must tell you of it.\"\n\n\"I'd sooner go away. Everybody here thinks ill of Mr. Greystock. But\nI don't think ill of Mr. Greystock, and I never shall. Why did Lord\nFawn say such very hard things about him?\"\n\nIt was suggested to her that she should be down-stairs early the next\nmorning, and apologise to Lord Fawn for her rudeness; but she would\nnot, on that night, undertake to do any such thing. Let Lady Fawn say\nwhat she might, Lucy thought that the injury had been done to her,\nand not to his lordship. And so they parted hardly friends. Lady\nFawn gave her no kiss as she went, and Lucy, with obstinate pride,\naltogether refused to own her fault. She would only say that she had\nbetter go, and when Lady Fawn over and over again pointed out to her\nthat the last thing that such a one as Lord Fawn could bear was to be\naccused of an untruth, she would continue to say that in that case he\nshould be careful to say nothing that was untrue. All this was very\ndreadful, and created great confusion and unhappiness at Fawn Court.\nLydia came into her room that night, and the two girls talked the\nmatter over for hours. In the morning Lucy was up early, and found\nLord Fawn walking in the grounds. She had been told that he would\nprobably be found walking in the grounds, if she were willing to\ntender to him any apology.\n\nHer mind had been very full of the subject,--not only in reference to\nher lover, but as it regarded her own conduct. One of the elder Fawn\ngirls had assured her that under no circumstances could a lady be\njustified in telling a gentleman that he had spoken an untruth, and\nshe was not quite sure but that the law so laid down was right. And\nthen she could not but remember that the gentleman in question was\nLord Fawn, and that she was Lady Fawn's governess. But Mr. Greystock\nwas her affianced lover, and her first duty was to him. And then,\ngranting that she herself had been wrong in accusing Lord Fawn of\nuntruth, she could not refrain from asking herself whether he had not\nbeen much more wrong in saying in her hearing that Mr. Greystock was\nnot a gentleman? And his offence had preceded her offence, and had\ncaused it! She hardly knew whether she did or did not owe an apology\nto Lord Fawn, but she was quite sure that Lord Fawn owed an apology\nto her.\n\nShe walked straight up to Lord Fawn, and met him beneath the trees.\nHe was still black and solemn, and was evidently brooding over his\ngrievance; but he bowed to her, and stood still as she approached\nhim. \"My lord,\" said she, \"I am very sorry for what happened last\nnight.\"\n\n\"And so was I,--very sorry, Miss Morris.\"\n\n\"I think you know that I am engaged to marry Mr. Greystock?\"\n\n\"I cannot allow that that has anything to do with it.\"\n\n\"When you think that he must be dearer to me than all the world, you\nwill acknowledge that I couldn't hear hard things said of him without\nspeaking.\" His face became blacker than ever, but he made no reply.\nHe wanted an abject begging of unconditional pardon from the little\ngirl who loved his enemy. If that were done, he would vouchsafe his\nforgiveness; but he was too small by nature to grant it on other\nterms. \"Of course,\" continued Lucy, \"I am bound to treat you with\nspecial respect in Lady Fawn's house.\" She looked almost beseechingly\ninto his face as she paused for a moment.\n\n\"But you treated me with especial disrespect,\" said Lord Fawn.\n\n\"And how did you treat me, Lord Fawn?\"\n\n\"Miss Morris, I must be allowed, in discussing matters with my\nmother, to express my own opinions in such language as I may think\nfit to use. Mr. Greystock's conduct to me was--was--was altogether\nmost ungentlemanlike.\"\n\n\"Mr. Greystock is a gentleman.\"\n\n\"His conduct was most offensive, and most--most ungentlemanlike. Mr.\nGreystock disgraced himself.\"\n\n\"It isn't true!\" said Lucy. Lord Fawn gave one start, and then walked\noff to the house as quick as his legs could carry him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\nMr. Dove in His Chambers\n\n\nThe scene between Lord Fawn and Greystock had taken place in Mr.\nCamperdown's chambers, and John Eustace had also been present. The\nlawyer had suffered considerable annoyance, before the arrival of the\ntwo first-named gentlemen, from reiterated assertions made by Eustace\nthat he would take no further trouble whatsoever about the jewels.\nMr. Camperdown had in vain pointed out to him that a plain duty lay\nupon him as executor and guardian to protect the property on behalf\nof his nephew; but Eustace had asserted that, though he himself was\ncomparatively a poor man, he would sooner replace the necklace out of\nhis own property, than be subject to the nuisance of such a continued\nquarrel. \"My dear John; ten thousand pounds!\" Mr. Camperdown had\nsaid. \"It is a fortune for a younger son.\"\n\n\"The boy is only two years old, and will have time enough to\nmake fortunes for his own younger sons, if he does not squander\neverything. If he does, the ten thousand pounds will make no\ndifference.\"\n\n\"But the justice of the thing, John!\"\n\n\"Justice may be purchased too dearly.\"\n\n\"Such a harpy as she is, too!\" pleaded the lawyer. Then Lord Fawn had\ncome in, and Greystock had followed immediately afterwards.\n\n\"I may as well say at once,\" said Greystock, \"that Lady Eustace is\ndetermined to maintain her right to the property; and that she will\nnot give up the diamonds till some adequate court of law shall have\ndecided that she is mistaken in her views. Stop one moment, Mr.\nCamperdown. I feel myself bound to go further than that, and express\nmy own opinion that she is right.\"\n\n\"I can hardly understand such an opinion as coming from you,\" said\nMr. Camperdown.\n\n\"You have changed your mind, at any rate,\" said John Eustace.\n\n\"Not so, Eustace. Mr. Camperdown, you'll be good enough to understand\nthat my opinion expressed here is that of a friend, and not that of a\nlawyer. And you must understand, Eustace,\" continued Greystock, \"that\nI am speaking now of my cousin's right to the property. Though the\nvalue be great, I have advised her to give up the custody of it for a\nwhile, till the matter shall be clearly decided. That has still been\nmy advice to her, and I have in no respect changed my mind. But she\nfeels that she is being cruelly used, and with a woman's spirit will\nnot, in such circumstances, yield anything. Mr. Camperdown actually\nstopped her carriage in the street.\"\n\n\"She would not answer a line that anybody wrote to her,\" said the\nlawyer.\n\n\"And I may say plainly,--for all here know the circumstances,--that\nLady Eustace feels the strongest possible indignation at the manner\nin which she is being treated by Lord Fawn.\"\n\n\"I have only asked her to give up the diamonds till the question\nshould be settled,\" said Lord Fawn.\n\n\"And you backed your request, my lord, by a threat! My cousin is\nnaturally most indignant; and, my lord, you must allow me to tell you\nthat I fully share the feeling.\"\n\n\"There is no use in making a quarrel about it,\" said Eustace.\n\n\"The quarrel is already made,\" replied Greystock. \"I am here to tell\nLord Fawn in your presence, and in the presence of Mr. Camperdown,\nthat he is behaving to a lady with ill-usage, which he would not\ndare to exercise did he not know that her position saves him from\nlegal punishment, as do the present usages of society from other\nconsequences.\"\n\n\"I have behaved to her with every possible consideration,\" said Lord\nFawn.\n\n\"That is a simple assertion,\" said the other. \"I have made one\nassertion, and you have made another. The world will have to judge\nbetween us. What right have you to take upon yourself to decide\nwhether this thing or that belongs to Lady Eustace or to any one\nelse?\"\n\n\"When the thing was talked about I was obliged to have an opinion,\"\nsaid Lord Fawn, who was still thinking of words in which to reply to\nthe insult offered him by Greystock without injury to his dignity as\nan Under-Secretary of State.\n\n\"Your conduct, sir, has been altogether inexcusable.\" Then Frank\nturned to the attorney. \"I have been given to understand that you are\ndesirous of knowing where this diamond necklace is at present. It is\nat Lady Eustace's house in Scotland;--at Portray Castle.\" Then he\nshook hands with John Eustace, bowed to Mr. Camperdown, and succeeded\nin leaving the room before Lord Fawn had so far collected his senses\nas to be able to frame his anger into definite words.\n\n\"I will never willingly speak to that man again,\" said Lord Fawn.\nBut as it was not probable that Greystock would greatly desire any\nfurther conversation with Lord Fawn, this threat did not carry with\nit any powerful feeling of severity.\n\nMr. Camperdown groaned over the matter with thorough vexation of\nspirit. It seemed to him as though the harpy, as he called her, would\nreally make good her case against him,--at any rate, would make it\nseem to be good for so long a time that all the triumph of success\nwould be hers. He knew that she was already in debt, and gave her\ncredit for a propensity to fast living which almost did her an\ninjustice. Of course, the jewels would be sold for half their value,\nand the harpy would triumph. Of what use to him or to the estate\nwould be a decision of the courts in his favour when the diamonds\nshould have been broken up and scattered to the winds of heaven? Ten\nthousand pounds! It was, to Mr. Camperdown's mind, a thing quite\nterrible that, in a country which boasts of its laws and of the\nexecution of its laws, such an impostor as was this widow should be\nable to lay her dirty, grasping fingers on so great an amount of\nproperty, and that there should be no means of punishing her. That\nLizzie Eustace had stolen the diamonds, as a pickpocket steals a\nwatch, was a fact as to which Mr. Camperdown had in his mind no\nshadow of a doubt. And, as the reader knows, he was right. She had\nstolen them. Mr. Camperdown knew that she had stolen them, and was\na wretched man. From the first moment of the late Sir Florian's\ninfatuation about this woman, she had worked woe for Mr. Camperdown.\nMr. Camperdown had striven hard,--to the great and almost permanent\noffence of Sir Florian,--to save Portray from its present condition\nof degradation; but he had striven in vain. Portray belonged to the\nharpy for her life; and moreover, he himself had been forced to be\ninstrumental in paying over to the harpy a large sum of Eustace\nmoney almost immediately on her becoming a widow. Then had come the\naffair of the diamonds;--an affair of ten thousand pounds!--as Mr.\nCamperdown would exclaim to himself, throwing his eyes up to the\nceiling. And now it seemed that she was to get the better of him even\nin that, although there could not be a shadow of doubt as to her\nfalsehood and fraudulent dishonesty! His luck in the matter was so\nbad! John Eustace had no backbone, no spirit, no proper feeling as to\nhis own family. Lord Fawn was as weak as water, and almost disgraced\nthe cause by the accident of his adherence to it. Greystock, who\nwould have been a tower of strength, had turned against him, and was\nnow prepared to maintain that the harpy was right. Mr. Camperdown\nknew that the harpy was wrong,--that she was a harpy, and he would\nnot abandon the cause; but the difficulties in his way were great,\nand the annoyance to which he was subjected was excessive. His\nwife and daughters were still at Dawlish, and he was up in town in\nSeptember, simply because the harpy had the present possession of\nthese diamonds.\n\nMr. Camperdown was a man turned sixty, handsome, grey-haired,\nhealthy, somewhat florid, and carrying in his face and person\nexternal signs of prosperity and that kind of self-assertion which\nprosperity always produces. But they who knew him best were aware\nthat he did not bear trouble well. In any trouble, such as was\nthis about the necklace, there would come over his face a look of\nweakness which betrayed the want of real inner strength. How many\nfaces one sees which, in ordinary circumstances, are comfortable,\nself-asserting, sufficient, and even bold; the lines of which,\nunder difficulties, collapse and become mean, spiritless, and\ninsignificant. There are faces which, in their usual form, seem\nto bluster with prosperity, but which the loss of a dozen points\nat whist will reduce to that currish aspect which reminds one of\na dog-whip. Mr. Camperdown's countenance, when Lord Fawn and Mr.\nEustace left him, had fallen away into this meanness of appearance.\nHe no longer carried himself as a man owning a dog-whip, but rather\nas the hound that feared it.\n\nA better attorney, for the purposes to which his life was devoted,\ndid not exist in London than Mr. Camperdown. To say that he was\nhonest, is nothing. To describe him simply as zealous, would be to\nfall very short of his merits. The interests of his clients were his\nown interests, and the legal rights of the properties of which he had\nthe legal charge, were as dear to him as his own blood. But it could\nnot be said of him that he was a learned lawyer. Perhaps in that\nbranch of a solicitor's profession in which he had been called upon\nto work, experience goes further than learning. It may be doubted,\nindeed, whether it is not so in every branch of every profession. But\nit might, perhaps, have been better for Mr. Camperdown had he devoted\nmore hours of his youth to reading books on conveyancing. He was now\ntoo old for such studies, and could trust only to the reading of\nother people. The reading, however, of other people was always at his\ncommand, and his clients were rich men who did not mind paying for\nan opinion. To have an opinion from Mr. Dove, or some other learned\ngentleman, was the every-day practice of his life; and when he\nobtained, as he often did, little coigns of legal vantage and subtle\ndefinitions as to property which were comfortable to him, he would\nrejoice to think that he could always have a Dove at his hand to\ntell him exactly how far he was justified in going in defence of his\nclients' interests. But now there had come to him no comfort from his\ncorner of legal knowledge. Mr. Dove had taken extraordinary pains in\nthe matter, and had simply succeeded in throwing over his employer.\n\"A necklace can't be an heirloom!\" said Mr. Camperdown to himself,\ntelling off on his fingers half-a-dozen instances in which he had\neither known or had heard that the head of a family had so arranged\nthe future possession of the family jewels. Then he again read Mr.\nDove's opinion, and actually took a law-book off his shelves with the\nview of testing the correctness of the barrister in reference to some\nspecial assertion. A pot or a pan might be an heirloom, but not a\nnecklace! Mr. Camperdown could hardly bring himself to believe that\nthis was law. And then as to paraphernalia! Up to this moment, though\nhe had been called upon to arrange great dealings in reference to\nwidows, he had never as yet heard of a claim made by a widow for\nparaphernalia. But then the widows with whom he had been called upon\nto deal, had been ladies quite content to accept the good things\nsettled upon them by the liberal prudence of their friends and\nhusbands,--not greedy, blood-sucking harpies such as this Lady\nEustace. It was quite terrible to Mr. Camperdown that one of his\nclients should have fallen into such a pit. Mors omnibus est\ncommunis. But to have left such a widow behind one!\n\n\"John,\" he said, opening his door. John was his son and partner, and\nJohn came to him, having been summoned by a clerk from another room.\n\"Just shut the door. I've had such a scene here;--Lord Fawn and Mr.\nGreystock almost coming to blows about that horrid woman.\"\n\n\"The Upper House would have got the worst of it, as it usually does,\"\nsaid the younger attorney.\n\n\"And there is John Eustace cares no more what becomes of the property\nthan if he had nothing to do with it;--absolutely talks of replacing\nthe diamonds out of his own pocket; a man whose personal interest in\nthe estate is by no means equal to her own.\"\n\n\"He wouldn't do it, you know,\" said Camperdown Junior, who did not\nknow the family.\n\n\"It's just what he would do,\" said the father, who did. \"There's\nnothing they wouldn't give away when once the idea takes them. Think\nof that woman having the whole Portray estate, perhaps for the next\nsixty years,--nearly the fee-simple of the property,--just because\nshe made eyes to Sir Florian!\"\n\n\"That's done and gone, father.\"\n\n\"And here's Dove tells us that a necklace can't be an heirloom,\nunless it belongs to the Crown.\"\n\n\"Whatever he says, you'd better take his word for it.\"\n\n\"I'm not so sure of that. It can't be. I'll tell you what I'll do.\nI'll go over and see him. We can file a bill in Chancery, I don't\ndoubt, and prove that the property belongs to the family and must go\nby the will. But she'll sell them before we can get the custody of\nthem.\"\n\n\"Perhaps she has done that already.\"\n\n\"Greystock says they are at Portray, and I believe they are. She was\nwearing them in London only in July,--a day or two before I saw her\nas she was leaving town. If anybody like a jeweller had been down at\nthe castle, I should have heard of it. She hasn't sold 'em yet, but\nshe will.\"\n\n\"She could do that just the same if they were an heirloom.\"\n\n\"No, John. I think not. We could have acted much more quickly, and\nhave frightened her.\"\n\n\"If I were you, father, I'd drop the matter altogether, and let\nJohn Eustace replace them if he pleases. We all know that he would\nnever be called on to do anything of the kind. It isn't our sort of\nbusiness.\"\n\n\"Not ten thousand pounds!\" said Camperdown Senior, to whom the\nmagnitude of the larceny almost ennobled the otherwise mean duty\nof catching the thief. Then Mr. Camperdown rose, and slowly walked\nacross the New Square, Lincoln's Inn, under the low archway, by the\nentrance to the old court in which Lord Eldon used to sit, to the Old\nSquare, in which the Turtle Dove had built his legal nest on a first\nfloor, close to the old gateway.\n\nMr. Dove was a gentleman who spent a very great portion of his life\nin this somewhat gloomy abode of learning. It was not now term time,\nand most of his brethren were absent from London, recruiting their\nstrength among the Alps, or drinking in vigours for fresh campaigns\nwith the salt sea breezes of Kent and Sussex, or perhaps shooting\ndeer in Scotland, or catching fish in Connemara. But Mr. Dove was a\nman of iron, who wanted no such recreation. To be absent from his\nlaw-books and the black, littered, ink-stained old table on which he\nwas wont to write his opinions, was, to him, to be wretched. The only\nexercise necessary to him was that of putting on his wig and going\ninto one of the courts that were close to his chambers;--but even\nthat was almost distasteful to him. He preferred sitting in his old\narm-chair, turning over his old books in search of old cases, and\nproducing opinions which he would be prepared to back against all the\nworld of Lincoln's Inn. He and Mr. Camperdown had known each other\nintimately for many years, and though the rank of the two men in\ntheir profession differed much, they were able to discuss questions\nof law without any appreciation of that difference among themselves.\nThe one man knew much, and the other little; the one was not only\nlearned, but possessed also of great gifts, while the other was\nsimply an ordinary clear-headed man of business; but they had\nsympathies in common which made them friends; they were both honest\nand unwilling to sell their services to dishonest customers; and\nthey equally entertained a deep-rooted contempt for that portion of\nmankind who thought that property could be managed and protected\nwithout the intervention of lawyers. The outside world to them was a\nworld of pretty, laughing, ignorant children; and lawyers were the\nparents, guardians, pastors, and masters by whom the children should\nbe protected from the evils incident to their childishness.\n\n\"Yes, sir; he's here,\" said the Turtle Dove's clerk. \"He is talking\nof going away, but he won't go. He's told me I can have a week, but I\ndon't know that I like to leave him. Mrs. Dove and the children are\ndown at Ramsgate, and he's here all night. He hadn't been out for so\nlong that when he wanted to go as far as the Temple yesterday, we\ncouldn't find his hat.\" Then the clerk opened the door, and ushered\nMr. Camperdown into the room. Mr. Dove was the younger man by five or\nsix years, and his hair was still black. Mr. Camperdown's was nearer\nwhite than grey; but, nevertheless, Mr. Camperdown looked as though\nhe were the younger man. Mr. Dove was a long, thin man, with a\nstoop in his shoulders, with deep-set, hollow eyes, and lanthorn\ncheeks, and sallow complexion, with long, thin hands, who seemed to\nacknowledge by every movement of his body and every tone of his voice\nthat old age was creeping on him,--whereas the attorney's step was\nstill elastic, and his speech brisk. Mr. Camperdown wore a blue\nfrock-coat, and a coloured cravat, and a light waistcoat. With Mr.\nDove every visible article of his raiment was black, except his\nshirt, and he had that peculiar blackness which a man achieves when\nhe wears a dress-coat over a high black waistcoat in the morning.\n\n\"You didn't make much, I fear, of what I sent you about heirlooms,\"\nsaid Mr. Dove, divining the purport of Mr. Camperdown's visit.\n\n\"A great deal more than I wanted, I can assure you, Mr. Dove.\"\n\n\"There is a common error about heirlooms.\"\n\n\"Very common, indeed, I should say. God bless my soul! when one knows\nhow often the word occurs in family deeds, it does startle one to be\ntold that there isn't any such thing.\"\n\n\"I don't think I said quite so much as that. Indeed, I was careful to\npoint out that the law does acknowledge heirlooms.\"\n\n\"But not diamonds,\" said the attorney.\n\n\"I doubt whether I went quite so far as that.\"\n\n\"Only the Crown diamonds.\"\n\n\"I don't think I ever debarred all other diamonds. A diamond in a\nstar of honour might form a part of an heirloom; but I do not think\nthat a diamond itself could be an heirloom.\"\n\n\"If in a star of honour, why not in a necklace?\" argued Mr.\nCamperdown almost triumphantly.\n\n\"Because a star of honour, unless tampered with by fraud, would\nnaturally be maintained in its original form. The setting of a\nnecklace will probably be altered from generation to generation. The\none, like a picture or a precious piece of furniture,--\"\n\n\"Or a pot or a pan,\" said Mr. Camperdown, with sarcasm.\n\n\"Pots and pans may be precious, too,\" replied Mr. Dove. \"Such things\ncan be traced, and can be held as heirlooms without imposing too\ngreat difficulties on their guardians. The Law is generally very wise\nand prudent, Mr. Camperdown;--much more so often than are they who\nattempt to improve it.\"\n\n\"I quite agree with you there, Mr. Dove.\"\n\n\"Would the Law do a service, do you think, if it lent its authority\nto the special preservation in special hands of trinkets only to be\nused for vanity and ornament? Is that a kind of property over which\nan owner should have a power of disposition more lasting, more\nautocratic, than is given him even in regard to land? The land, at\nany rate, can be traced. It is a thing fixed and known. A string of\npearls is not only alterable, but constantly altered, and cannot\neasily be traced.\"\n\n\"Property of such enormous value should, at any rate, be protected,\"\nsaid Mr. Camperdown indignantly.\n\n\"All property is protected, Mr. Camperdown;--although, as we know\ntoo well, such protection can never be perfect. But the system of\nheirlooms, if there can be said to be such a system, was not devised\nfor what you and I mean when we talk of protection of property.\"\n\n\"I should have said that that was just what it was devised for.\"\n\n\"I think not. It was devised with the more picturesque idea of\nmaintaining chivalric associations. Heirlooms have become so, not\nthat the future owners of them may be assured of so much wealth,\nwhatever the value of the thing so settled may be,--but that the son\nor grandson or descendant may enjoy the satisfaction which is derived\nfrom saying, my father or my grandfather or my ancestor sat in that\nchair, or looked as he now looks in that picture, or was graced\nby wearing on his breast that very ornament which you now see\nlying beneath the glass. Crown jewels are heirlooms in the same\nway, as representing not the possession of the sovereign, but the\ntime-honoured dignity of the Crown. The Law, which, in general,\nconcerns itself with our property or lives and our liberties, has in\nthis matter bowed gracefully to the spirit of chivalry and has lent\nits aid to romance;--but it certainly did not do so to enable the\ndiscordant heirs of a rich man to settle a simple dirty question of\nmoney, which, with ordinary prudence, the rich man should himself\nhave settled before he died.\"\n\nThe Turtle Dove had spoken with emphasis and had spoken well, and Mr.\nCamperdown had not ventured to interrupt him while he was speaking.\nHe was sitting far back on his chair, but with his neck bent and with\nhis head forward, rubbing his long thin hands slowly over each other,\nand with his deep bright eyes firmly fixed on his companion's face.\nMr. Camperdown had not unfrequently heard him speak in the same\nfashion before, and was accustomed to his manner of unravelling the\nmysteries and searching into the causes of Law with a spirit which\nalmost lent poetry to the subject. When Mr. Dove would do so, Mr.\nCamperdown would not quite understand the words spoken, but he would\nlisten to them with an undoubting reverence. And he did understand\nthem in part, and was conscious of an infusion of a certain amount of\npoetic spirit into his own bosom. He would think of these speeches\nafterwards, and would entertain high but somewhat cloudy ideas of the\nbeauty and the majesty of Law. Mr. Dove's speeches did Mr. Camperdown\ngood, and helped to preserve him from that worst of all diseases,--a\nlow idea of humanity.\n\n\"You think, then, we had better not claim them as heirlooms?\" he\nasked.\n\n\"I think you had better not.\"\n\n\"And you think that she could claim them--as paraphernalia?\"\n\n\"That question has hardly been put to me,--though I allowed myself to\nwander into it. But for my intimacy with you, I should hardly have\nventured to stray so far.\"\n\n\"I need hardly say how much obliged we are. But we will submit one or\ntwo other cases to you.\"\n\n\"I am inclined to think the court would not allow them to her as\nparaphernalia, seeing that their value is excessive as compared with\nher income and degree; but if it did, it would do so in a fashion\nthat would guard them from alienation.\"\n\n\"She would sell them--under the rose.\"\n\n\"Then she would be guilty of stealing them,--which she would hardly\nattempt, even if not restrained by honesty, knowing, as she would\nknow, that the greatness of the value would almost assuredly lead to\ndetection. The same feeling would prevent buyers from purchasing.\"\n\n\"She says, you know, that they were given to her, absolutely.\"\n\n\"I should like to know the circumstances.\"\n\n\"Yes;--of course.\"\n\n\"But I should be disposed to think that in equity no allegation by\nthe receiver of such a gift, unsubstantiated either by evidence or\nby deed, would be allowed to stand. The gentleman left behind him a\nwill, and regular settlements. I should think that the possession of\nthese diamonds,--not, I presume, touched on in the settlements--\"\n\n\"Oh dear no;--not a word about them.\"\n\n\"I should think, then, that, subject to any claim for paraphernalia,\nthe possession of the diamonds would be ruled by the will.\" Mr.\nCamperdown was rushing into the further difficulty of the chattels\nin Scotland and those in England, when the Turtle Dove stopped him,\ndeclaring that he could not venture to discuss matters as to which he\nknew none of the facts.\n\n\"Of course not;--of course not,\" said Mr. Camperdown. \"We'll have\ncases prepared. I'd apologise for coming at all, only that I get so\nmuch from a few words.\"\n\n\"I'm always delighted to see you, Mr. Camperdown,\" said the Turtle\nDove, bowing.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\n\"I Had Better Go Away\"\n\n\nWhen Lord Fawn gave a sudden jump and stalked away towards the house\non that Sunday morning before breakfast, Lucy Morris was a very\nunhappy girl. She had a second time accused Lord Fawn of speaking an\nuntruth. She did not quite understand the usages of the world in the\nmatter; but she did know that the one offence which a gentleman is\nsupposed never to commit is that of speaking an untruth. The offence\nmay be one committed oftener than any other by gentlemen,--as also\nby all other people; but, nevertheless, it is regarded by the usages\nof society as being the one thing which a gentleman never does. Of\nall this Lucy understood something. The word \"lie\" she knew to be\nutterly abominable. That Lizzie Eustace was a little liar had been\nacknowledged between herself and the Fawn girls very often,--but to\nhave told Lady Eustace that any word spoken by her was a lie, would\nhave been a worse crime than the lie itself. To have brought such\nan accusation, in that term, against Lord Fawn, would have been to\ndegrade herself for ever. Was there any difference between a lie\nand an untruth? That one must be, and that the other need not be,\nintentional, she did feel; but she felt also that the less offensive\nword had come to mean a lie,--the world having been driven so to use\nit because the world did not dare to talk about lies; and this word,\nbearing such a meaning in common parlance, she had twice applied to\nLord Fawn. And yet, as she was well aware, Lord Fawn had told no lie.\nHe had himself believed every word that he had spoken against Frank\nGreystock. That he had been guilty of unmanly cruelty in so speaking\nof her lover in her presence, Lucy still thought, but she should not\ntherefore have accused him of falsehood. \"It was untrue all the\nsame,\" she said to herself, as she stood still on the gravel walk,\nwatching the rapid disappearance of Lord Fawn, and endeavouring to\nthink what she had better now do with herself. Of course Lord Fawn,\nlike a great child, would at once go and tell his mother what that\nwicked governess had said to him.\n\nIn the hall she met her friend Lydia. \"Oh, Lucy, what is the matter\nwith Frederic?\" she asked.\n\n\"Lord Fawn is very angry indeed.\"\n\n\"With you?\"\n\n\"Yes;--with me. He is so angry that I am sure he would not sit down\nto breakfast with me. So I won't come down. Will you tell your mamma?\nIf she likes to send to me, of course I'll go to her at once.\"\n\n\"What have you done, Lucy?\"\n\n\"I've told him again that what he said wasn't true.\"\n\n\"But why?\"\n\n\"Because--Oh, how can I say why? Why does any person do everything\nthat she ought not to do? It's the fall of Adam, I suppose.\"\n\n\"You shouldn't make a joke of it, Lucy.\"\n\n\"You can have no conception how unhappy I am about it. Of course Lady\nFawn will tell me to go away. I went out on purpose to beg his pardon\nfor what I said last night, and I just said the very same thing\nagain.\"\n\n\"But why did you say it?\"\n\n\"And I should say it again and again and again, if he were to go on\ntelling me that Mr. Greystock isn't a gentleman. I don't think he\nought to have done it. Of course, I have been very wrong; I know\nthat. But I think he has been wrong too. But I must own it, and he\nneedn't. I'll go up now and stay in my own room till your mamma sends\nfor me.\"\n\n\"And I'll get Jane to bring you some breakfast.\"\n\n\"I don't care a bit about breakfast,\" said Lucy.\n\nLord Fawn did tell his mother, and Lady Fawn was perplexed in the\nextreme. She was divided in her judgment and feelings between the\nprivilege due to Lucy as a girl possessed of an authorised lover,--a\nprivilege which no doubt existed, but which was not extensive,--and\nthe very much greater privilege which attached to Lord Fawn as a man,\nas a peer, as an Under-Secretary of State,--but which attached to\nhim especially as the head and only man belonging to the Fawn family.\nSuch a one, when, moved by filial duty, he condescends to come once a\nweek to his mother's house, is entitled to say whatever he pleases,\nand should on no account be contradicted by any one. Lucy no doubt\nhad a lover,--an authorised lover; but perhaps that fact could not\nbe taken as more than a balancing weight against the inferiority\nof her position as a governess. Lady Fawn was of course obliged to\ntake her son's part, and would scold Lucy. Lucy must be scolded very\nseriously. But it would be a thing so desirable if Lucy could be\ninduced to accept her scolding and have done with it, and not to make\nmatters worse by talking of going away! \"You don't mean that she came\nout into the shrubbery, having made up her mind to be rude to you?\"\nsaid Lady Fawn to her son.\n\n\"No;--I do not think that. But her temper is so ungovernable, and she\nhas, if I may say so, been so spoilt among you here,--I mean by the\ngirls, of course,--that she does not know how to restrain herself.\"\n\n\"She is as good as gold, you know, Frederic.\" He shrugged his\nshoulders, and declared that he had not a word more to say about\nit. He could, of course, remain in London till it should suit Mr.\nGreystock to take his bride. \"You'll break my heart if you say that!\"\nexclaimed the unhappy mother. \"Of course, she shall leave the house\nif you wish it.\"\n\n\"I wish nothing,\" said Lord Fawn. \"But I peculiarly object to be told\nthat I am a--liar.\" Then he stalked away along the corridor and went\ndown to breakfast, as black as a thunder-cloud.\n\nLady Fawn and Lucy sat opposite to each other in church, but they\ndid not speak till the afternoon. Lady Fawn went to church in the\ncarriage and Lucy walked, and as Lucy retired to her room immediately\non her return to the house, there had not been an opportunity even\nfor a word. After lunch Amelia came up to her, and sat down for a\nlong discussion. \"Now, Lucy, something must be done, you know,\" said\nAmelia.\n\n\"I suppose so.\"\n\n\"Of course, mamma must see you. She can't allow things to go on\nin this way. Mamma is very unhappy, and didn't eat a morsel of\nbreakfast.\" By this latter assertion Amelia simply intended to imply\nthat her mother had refused to be helped a second time to fried\nbacon, as was customary.\n\n\"Of course, I shall go to her the moment she sends for me. Oh,--I am\nso unhappy!\"\n\n\"I don't wonder at that, Lucy. So is my brother unhappy. These things\nmake people unhappy. It is what the world calls--temper, you know,\nLucy.\"\n\n\"Why did he tell me that Mr. Greystock isn't a gentleman? Mr.\nGreystock is a gentleman. I meant to say nothing more than that.\"\n\n\"But you did say more, Lucy.\"\n\n\"When he said that Mr. Greystock wasn't a gentleman, I told him it\nwasn't true. Why did he say it? He knows all about it. Everybody\nknows. Would you think it wise to come and abuse him to me, when you\nknow what he is to me? I can't bear it, and I won't. I'll go away\nto-morrow, if your mamma wishes it.\" But that going away was just\nwhat Lady Fawn did not wish.\n\n\"I think you know, Lucy, you should express your deep sorrow at what\nhas passed.\"\n\n\"To your brother?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then he would abuse Mr. Greystock again, and it would all be as bad\nas ever. I'll beg Lord Fawn's pardon if he'll promise beforehand not\nto say a word about Mr. Greystock.\"\n\n\"You can't expect him to make a bargain like that, Lucy.\"\n\n\"I suppose not. I daresay I'm very wicked, and I must be left wicked.\nI'm too wicked to stay here. That's the long and the short of it.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid you're proud, Lucy.\"\n\n\"I suppose I am. If it wasn't for all that I owe to everybody\nhere, and that I love you all so much, I should be proud of being\nproud;--because of Mr. Greystock. Only it kills me to make Lady Fawn\nunhappy.\"\n\nAmelia left the culprit, feeling that no good had been done, and Lady\nFawn did not see the delinquent till late in the afternoon. Lord Fawn\nhad, in the meantime, wandered out along the river all alone to brood\nover the condition of his affairs. It had been an evil day for him in\nwhich he had first seen Lady Eustace. From the first moment of his\nengagement to her he had been an unhappy man. Her treatment of him,\nthe stories which reached his ears from Mrs. Hittaway and others,\nMr. Camperdown's threats of law in regard to the diamonds, and Frank\nGreystock's insults, altogether made him aware that he could not\npossibly marry Lady Eustace. But yet he had no proper and becoming\nway of escaping from the bonds of his engagement. He was a man with a\nconscience, and was made miserable by the idea of behaving badly to\na woman. Perhaps it might have been difficult to analyse his misery,\nand to decide how much arose from the feeling that he was behaving\nbadly, and how much from the conviction that the world would accuse\nhim of doing so; but, between the two, he was wretched enough. The\npunishment of the offence had been commenced by Greystock's unavenged\ninsults;--and it now seemed to him that this girl's conduct was a\ncontinuation of it. The world was already beginning to treat him with\nthat want of respect which he so greatly dreaded. He knew that he was\ntoo weak to stand up against a widely-spread expression of opinion\nthat he had behaved badly. There are men who can walk about the\nstreets with composed countenances, take their seats in Parliament if\nthey happen to have seats, work in their offices, or their chambers,\nor their counting-houses with diligence, and go about the world\nserenely, even though everybody be saying evil of them behind their\nbacks. Such men can live down temporary calumny, and almost take a\ndelight in the isolation which it will produce. Lord Fawn knew well\nthat he was not such a man. He would have described his own weakness\nas caused, perhaps, by a too thin-skinned sensitiveness. Those who\nknew him were inclined to say that he lacked strength of character,\nand, perhaps, courage.\n\nHe had certainly engaged himself to marry this widow, and he was most\ndesirous to do what was right. He had said that he would not marry\nher unless she would give up the necklace, and he was most desirous\nto be true to his word. He had been twice insulted, and he was\nanxious to support these injuries with dignity. Poor Lucy's little\noffence against him rankled in his mind with the other great\noffences. That this humble friend of his mother's should have been so\ninsolent was a terrible thing to him. He was not sure even whether\nhis own sisters did not treat him with scantier reverence than of\nyore. And yet he was so anxious to do right, and do his duty in\nthat state of life to which it had pleased God to call him! As to\nmuch he was in doubt; but of two things he was quite sure,--that\nFrank Greystock was a scoundrel, and that Lucy Morris was the most\nimpertinent young woman in England.\n\n\"What would you wish to have done, Frederic?\" his mother said to him\non his return.\n\n\"In what respect, mother?\"\n\n\"About Lucy Morris? I have not seen her yet. I have thought it better\nthat she should be left to herself for a while before I did so. I\nsuppose she must come down to dinner. She always does.\"\n\n\"I do not wish to interfere with the young lady's meals.\"\n\n\"No;--but about meeting her? If there is to be no talking it will\nbe so very unpleasant. It will be unpleasant to us all, but I am\nthinking chiefly of you.\"\n\n\"I do not wish anybody to be disturbed for my comfort.\" A young woman\ncoming down to dinner as though in disgrace, and not being spoken to\nby any one, would, in truth, have had rather a soothing effect upon\nLord Fawn, who would have felt that the general silence and dulness\nhad been produced as a sacrifice in his honour. \"I can, of course,\ninsist that she should apologise; but if she refuses, what shall I do\nthen?\"\n\n\"Let there be no more apologies, if you please, mother.\"\n\n\"What shall I do then, Frederic?\"\n\n\"Miss Morris's idea of an apology is a repetition of her offence with\nincreased rudeness. It is not for me to say what you should do. If it\nbe true that she is engaged to that man--\"\n\n\"It is true, certainly.\"\n\n\"No doubt that will make her quite independent of you, and I can\nunderstand that her presence here in such circumstances must be very\nuncomfortable to you all. No doubt she feels her power.\"\n\n\"Indeed, Frederic, you do not know her.\"\n\n\"I can hardly say that I desire to know her better. You cannot\nsuppose that I can be anxious for further intimacy with a young lady\nwho has twice given me the lie in your house. Such conduct is, at\nleast, very unusual; and as no absolute punishment can be inflicted,\nthe offender can only be avoided. It is thus, and thus only, that\nsuch offences can be punished. I shall be satisfied if you will give\nher to understand that I should prefer that she should not address me\nagain.\"\n\nPoor Lady Fawn was beginning to think that Lucy was right in saying\nthat there was no remedy for all these evils but that she should go\naway. But whither was she to go? She had no home but such home as she\ncould earn for herself by her services as a governess, and in her\npresent position it was almost out of the question that she should\nseek another place. Lady Fawn, too, felt that she had pledged herself\nto Mr. Greystock that till next year Lucy should have a home at Fawn\nCourt. Mr. Greystock, indeed, was now an enemy to the family; but\nLucy was not an enemy, and it was out of the question that she should\nbe treated with real enmity. She might be scolded, and scowled at,\nand put into a kind of drawing-room Coventry for a time,--so that all\nkindly intercourse with her should be confined to school-room work\nand bed-room conferences. She could be generally \"sat upon,\" as Nina\nwould call it. But as for quarrelling with her,--making a real enemy\nof one whom they all loved, one whom Lady Fawn knew to be \"as good\nas gold,\" one who had become so dear to the old lady that actual\nextrusion from their family affections would be like the cutting off\nof a limb,--that was simply impossible. \"I suppose I had better go\nand see her,\" said Lady Fawn,--\"and I have got such a headache.\"\n\n\"Do not see her on my account,\" said Lord Fawn. The duty, however,\nwas obligatory, and Lady Fawn with slow steps sought Lucy in the\nschool-room.\n\n\"Lucy,\" she said, seating herself, \"what is to be the end of all\nthis?\"\n\nLucy came up to her and knelt at her feet. \"If you knew how unhappy I\nam because I have vexed you!\"\n\n\"I am unhappy, my dear, because I think you have been betrayed by\nwarm temper into misbehaviour.\"\n\n\"I know I have.\"\n\n\"Then why do you not control your temper?\"\n\n\"If anybody were to come to you, Lady Fawn, and make horrible\naccusations against Lord Fawn, or against Augusta, would not you be\nangry? Would you be able to stand it?\"\n\nLady Fawn was not clear-headed; she was not clever; nor was she even\nalways rational. But she was essentially honest. She knew that she\nwould fly at anybody who should in her presence say such bitter\nthings of any of her children as Lord Fawn had said of Mr. Greystock\nin Lucy's hearing;--and she knew also that Lucy was entitled to hold\nMr. Greystock as dearly as she held her own sons and daughters. Lord\nFawn, at Fawn Court, could not do wrong. That was a tenet by which\nshe was obliged to hold fast. And yet Lucy had been subjected to\ngreat cruelty. She thought awhile for a valid argument. \"My dear,\"\nshe said, \"your youth should make a difference.\"\n\n\"Of course it should.\"\n\n\"And though to me and to the girls you are as dear as any friend can\nbe, and may say just what you please-- Indeed, we all live here in\nsuch a way that we all do say just what we please,--young and old\ntogether. But you ought to know that Lord Fawn is different.\"\n\n\"Ought he to say that Mr. Greystock is not a gentleman to me?\"\n\n\"We are, of course, very sorry that there should be any quarrel. It\nis all the fault of that--nasty, false young woman.\"\n\n\"So it is, Lady Fawn. Lady Fawn, I have been thinking about it all\nthe day, and I am quite sure that I had better not stay here while\nyou and the girls think badly of Mr. Greystock. It is not only about\nLord Fawn, but because of the whole thing. I am always wanting to\nsay something good about Mr. Greystock, and you are always thinking\nsomething bad about him. You have been to me,--oh, the very best\nfriend that a girl ever had. Why you should have treated me so\ngenerously I never could know.\"\n\n\"Because we have loved you.\"\n\n\"But when a girl has got a man whom she loves, and has promised to\nmarry, he must be her best friend of all. Is it not so, Lady Fawn?\"\nThe old woman stooped down and kissed the girl who had got the man.\n\"It is not ingratitude to you that makes me think most of him; is\nit?\"\n\n\"Certainly not, dear.\"\n\n\"Then I had better go away.\"\n\n\"But where will you go, Lucy?\"\n\n\"I will consult Mr. Greystock.\"\n\n\"But what can he do, Lucy? It will only be a trouble to him. He can't\nfind a home for you.\"\n\n\"Perhaps they would have me at the deanery,\" said Lucy slowly. She\nhad evidently been thinking much of it all. \"And, Lady Fawn, I will\nnot go down-stairs while Lord Fawn is here; and when he comes,--if he\ndoes come again while I am here,--he shall not be troubled by seeing\nme. He may be sure of that. And you may tell him that I don't defend\nmyself, only I shall always think that he ought not to have said that\nMr. Greystock wasn't a gentleman before me.\" When Lady Fawn left Lucy\nthe matter was so far settled that Lucy had neither been asked to\ncome down to dinner, nor had she been forbidden to seek another home.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\nMr. Greystock's Troubles\n\n\nFrank Greystock stayed the Sunday in London and went down to\nBobsborough on the Monday. His father and mother and sister all knew\nof his engagement to Lucy, and they had heard also that Lady Eustace\nwas to become Lady Fawn. Of the necklace they had hitherto heard very\nlittle, and of the quarrel between the two lovers they had heard\nnothing. There had been many misgivings at the deanery, and some\nregrets, about these marriages. Mrs. Greystock, Frank's mother, was,\nas we are so wont to say of many women, the best woman in the world.\nShe was unselfish, affectionate, charitable, and thoroughly feminine.\nBut she did think that her son Frank, with all his advantages,--good\nlooks, cleverness, general popularity, and seat in Parliament,--might\njust as well marry an heiress as a little girl without twopence in\nthe world. As for herself, who had been born a Jackson, she could\ndo with very little; but the Greystocks were all people who wanted\nmoney. For them there was never more than ninepence in a shilling, if\nso much. They were a race who could not pay their way with moderate\nincomes. Even the dear dean, who really had a conscience about money,\nand who hardly ever left Bobsborough, could not be kept quite clear\nof debt, let her do what she would. As for the admiral, the dean's\nelder brother, he had been notorious for insolvency; and Frank was a\nGreystock all over. He was the very man to whom money with a wife was\nalmost a necessity of existence.\n\nAnd his pretty cousin, the widow, who was devoted to him, and would\nhave married him at a word, had ever so many thousands a year! Of\ncourse, Lizzie Eustace was not just all that she should be;--but then\nwho is? In one respect, at any rate, her conduct had always been\nproper. There was no rumour against her as to lovers or flirtations.\nShe was very young, and Frank might have moulded her as he pleased.\nOf course there were regrets. Poor dear little Lucy Morris was as\ngood as gold. Mrs. Greystock was quite willing to admit that. She\nwas not good-looking;--so at least Mrs. Greystock said. She never\nwould allow that Lucy was good-looking. And she didn't see much in\nLucy, who, according to her idea, was a little chit of a thing. Her\nposition was simply that of a governess. Mrs. Greystock declared to\nher daughter that no one in the whole world had a higher respect for\ngovernesses than had she. But a governess is a governess;--and for a\nman in Frank's position such a marriage would be simply suicide.\n\n\"You shouldn't say that, mamma, now; for it's fixed,\" said Ellinor\nGreystock.\n\n\"But I do say it, my dear. Things sometimes are fixed which must be\nunfixed. You know your brother.\"\n\n\"Frank is earning a large income, mamma.\"\n\n\"Did you ever know a Greystock who didn't want more than his income?\"\n\n\"I hope I don't, mamma, and mine is very small.\"\n\n\"You're a Jackson. Frank is Greystock to the very backbone. If he\nmarries Lucy Morris he must give up Parliament. That's all.\"\n\nThe dean himself was more reticent and less given to interference\nthan his wife; but he felt it also. He would not for the world have\nhinted to his son that it might be well to marry money; but he\nthought that it was a good thing that his son should go where money\nwas. He knew that Frank was apt to spend his guineas faster than\nhe got them. All his life long the dean had seen what came of such\nspending. Frank had gone out into the world and had prospered,--but\nhe could hardly continue to prosper unless he married money. Of\ncourse, there had been regrets when the news came of that fatal\nengagement with Lucy Morris. \"It can't be for the next ten years, at\nany rate,\" said Mrs. Greystock.\n\n\"I thought at one time that he would have made a match with his\ncousin,\" said the dean.\n\n\"Of course;--so did everybody,\" replied Mrs. Dean.\n\nThen Frank came among them. He had intended staying some\nweeks,--perhaps for a month, and great preparations were made for\nhim; but immediately on his arrival he announced the necessity that\nwas incumbent on him of going down again to Scotland in ten days.\n\"You've heard about Lizzie, of course?\" he said. They had heard\nthat Lizzie was to become Lady Fawn, but beyond that they had heard\nnothing. \"You know about the necklace?\" asked Frank. Something of a\ntale of a necklace had made its way even down to quiet Bobsborough.\nThey had been informed that there was a dispute between the widow and\nthe executors of the late Sir Florian about some diamonds. \"Lord Fawn\nis behaving about it in the most atrocious manner,\" continued Frank,\n\"and the long and the short of it is that there will be no marriage!\"\n\n\"No marriage!\" exclaimed Mrs. Greystock.\n\n\"And what is the truth about the diamonds?\" asked the dean.\n\n\"Ah;--it will give the lawyers a job before they decide that. They're\nvery valuable;--worth about ten thousand pounds, I'm told; but the\nmost of it will go among some of my friends at the Chancery bar. It's\na pity that I should be out of the scramble myself.\"\n\n\"But why should you be out?\" asked his mother with tender\nregrets,--not thinking of the matter as her son was thinking of it,\nbut feeling that when there was so much wealth so very near him, he\nought not to let it all go past him.\n\n\"As far as I can see,\" continued Frank, \"she has a fair claim to\nthem. I suppose they'll file a bill in Chancery, and then it will\nbe out of my line altogether. She says her husband gave them to\nher,--absolutely put them on her neck himself, and told her that\nthey were hers. As to their being an heirloom, that turns out to be\nimpossible. I didn't know it, but it seems you can't make diamonds\nan heirloom. What astonishes me is, that Fawn should object to the\nnecklace. However, he has objected, and has simply told her that he\nwon't marry her unless she gives them up.\"\n\n\"And what does she say?\"\n\n\"Storms and raves,--as of course any woman would. I don't think she\nis behaving badly. What she wants is, to reduce him to obedience, and\nthen to dismiss him. I think that is no more than fair. Nothing on\nearth would make her marry him now.\"\n\n\"Did she ever care for him?\"\n\n\"I don't think she ever did. She found her position to be\ntroublesome, and she thought she had better marry. And then he's a\nlord,--which always goes for something.\"\n\n\"I am sorry you should have so much trouble,\" said Mrs. Greystock.\nBut in truth the mother was not sorry. She did not declare to herself\nthat it would be a good thing that her son should be false to Lucy\nMorris in order that he might marry his rich cousin; but she did\nfeel it to be an advantage that he should be on terms of intimacy\nwith so large an income as that belonging to Lady Eustace. \"Doan't\nthou marry for munny, but goa where munny is.\" Mrs. Greystock would\nhave repudiated the idea of mercenary marriages in any ordinary\nconversation, and would have been severe on any gentleman who was\nfalse to a young lady. But it is so hard to bring one's general\nprinciples to bear on one's own conduct or in one's own family;--and\nthen the Greystocks were so peculiar a people! When her son told her\nthat he must go down to Scotland again very shortly, she reconciled\nherself to his loss. Had he left Bobsborough for the sake of being\nnear Lucy at Richmond, she would have felt it very keenly.\n\nDays passed by, and nothing was said about poor Lucy. Mrs. Greystock\nhad made up her mind that she would say nothing on the subject.\nLucy had behaved badly in allowing herself to be loved by a man who\nought to have loved money, and Mrs. Greystock had resolved that she\nwould show her feelings by silence. The dean had formed no fixed\ndetermination, but he had thought that it might be, perhaps, as well\nto drop the subject. Frank himself was unhappy about it; but from\nmorning to evening, and from day to day, he allowed it to pass by\nwithout a word. He knew that it should not be so, that such silence\nwas in truth treachery to Lucy;--but he was silent. What had he meant\nwhen, as he left Lizzie Eustace among the rocks at Portray,--in that\nlast moment,--he had assured her that he would be true to her? And\nwhat had been Lizzie's meaning? He was more sure of Lizzie's meaning\nthan he was of his own. \"It's a very rough world to live in,\" he said\nto himself in these days as he thought of his difficulties.\n\nBut when he had been nearly a week at the deanery, and when the day\nof his going was so near as to be a matter of concern, his sister did\nat last venture to say a word about Lucy. \"I suppose there is nothing\nsettled about your own marriage, Frank?\"\n\n\"Nothing at all.\"\n\n\"Nor will be for some while?\"\n\n\"Nor will be,--for some while.\" This he said in a tone which he\nhimself felt to be ill-humoured and almost petulant. And he felt also\nthat such ill-humour on such a subject was unkind, not to his sister,\nbut to Lucy. It seemed to imply that the matter of his marriage was\ndistasteful to him. \"The truth is,\" he said, \"that nothing can be\nfixed. Lucy understands that as well as I do. I am not in a position\nat once to marry a girl who has nothing. It's a pity, perhaps, that\none can't train one's self to like some girl best that has got money;\nbut as I haven't, there must be some delay. She is to stay where she\nis,--at any rate, for a twelvemonth.\"\n\n\"But you mean to see her?\"\n\n\"Well, yes; I hardly know how I can see her, as I have quarrelled to\nthe knife with Lord Fawn; and Lord Fawn is recognised by his mother\nand sisters as the one living Jupiter upon earth.\"\n\n\"I like them for that,\" said Ellinor.\n\n\"Only it prevents my going to Richmond;--and poor Fawn himself is\nsuch an indifferent Jupiter.\"\n\nThat was all that was said about Lucy at Bobsborough, till there\ncame a letter from Lucy to her lover acquainting him with the\ncircumstances of her unfortunate position at Richmond. She did not\ntell him quite all the circumstances. She did not repeat the strong\nexpressions which Lord Fawn had used, nor did she clearly explain how\nwrathful she had been herself. \"Lord Fawn has been here,\" she said,\n\"and there has been ever so much unpleasantness. He is very angry\nwith you about Lady Eustace, and of course Lady Fawn takes his part.\nI need not tell you whose part I take. And so there have been what\nthe servants call--'just a few words.' It is very dreadful, isn't\nit? And, after all, Lady Fawn has been as kind as possible. But the\nupshot of it is, that I am not to stay here. You mustn't suppose\nthat I'm to be turned out at twelve hours' notice. I am to stay till\narrangements have been made, and everybody will be kind to me. But\nwhat had I better do? I'll try and get another situation at once if\nyou think it best, only I suppose I should have to explain how long I\ncould stay. Lady Fawn knows that I am writing to you to ask you what\nyou think best.\"\n\nOn receipt of this, Greystock was very much puzzled. What a little\nfool Lucy had been, and yet what a dear little fool! Who cared for\nLord Fawn and his hard words? Of course, Lord Fawn would say all\nmanner of evil things of him, and would crow valiantly in his own\nfarm-yard; but it would have been so much wiser on Lucy's part to\nhave put up with the crowing, and to have disregarded altogether\nthe words of a man so weak and insignificant! But the evil was done,\nand he must make some arrangement for poor Lucy's comfort. Had he\nknown exactly how matters stood, that the proposition as to Lucy's\ndeparture had come wholly from herself, and that at the present time\nall the ladies at Fawn Court,--of course, in the absence of Lord\nFawn,--were quite disposed to forgive Lucy if Lucy would only be\nforgiven, and hide herself when Lord Fawn should come;--had Frank\nknown all this, he might, perhaps, have counselled her to remain\nat Richmond. But he believed that Lady Fawn had insisted on Lucy's\ndeparture; and of course, in such a case, Lucy must depart. He showed\nthe letter to his sister, and asked for advice. \"How very\nunfortunate!\" said Ellinor.\n\n\"Yes; is it not?\"\n\n\"I wonder what she said to Lord Fawn?\"\n\n\"She would speak out very plainly.\"\n\n\"I suppose she has spoken out plainly, or otherwise they would never\nhave told her to go away. It seems so unlike what I have always heard\nof Lady Fawn.\"\n\n\"Lucy can be very headstrong if she pleases,\" said Lucy's lover.\n\"What on earth had I better do for her? I don't suppose she can get\nanother place that would suit.\"\n\n\"If she is to be your wife, I don't think she should go into another\nplace. If it is quite fixed,--\" she said, and then she looked into\nher brother's face.\n\n\"Well; what then?\"\n\n\"If you are sure you mean it--\"\n\n\"Of course I mean it.\"\n\n\"Then she had better come here. As for her going out as a governess,\nand telling the people that she is to be your wife in a few months,\nthat is out of the question. And it would, I think, be equally so\nthat she should go into any house and not tell the truth. Of course,\nthis would be the place for her.\" It was at last decided that Ellinor\nshould discuss the matter with her mother.\n\nWhen the whole matter was unfolded to Mrs. Greystock, that lady was\nmore troubled than ever. If Lucy were to come to the deanery, she\nmust come as Frank's affianced bride, and must be treated as such by\nall Bobsborough. The dean would be giving his express sanction to the\nmarriage, and so would Mrs. Greystock herself. She knew well that she\nhad no power of refusing her sanction. Frank must do as he pleased\nabout marrying. Were Lucy once his wife, of course she would be made\nwelcome to the best the deanery could give her. There was no doubt\nabout Lucy being as good as gold;--only that real gold, vile as it\nis, was the one thing that Frank so much needed. The mother thought\nthat she had discovered in her son something which seemed to indicate\na possibility that this very imprudent match might at last be\nabandoned; and if there were such possibility, surely Lucy ought not\nnow to be brought to the deanery. Nevertheless, if Frank were to\ninsist upon her coming,--she must come.\n\nBut Mrs. Greystock had a plan. \"Oh, mamma,\" said Ellinor, when the\nplan was proposed to her, \"do not you think that would be cruel?\"\n\n\"Cruel, my dear! no; certainly not cruel.\"\n\n\"She is such a virago.\"\n\n\"You think that because Lizzie Eustace has said so. I don't know\nthat she's a virago at all. I believe her to be a very good sort of\nwoman.\"\n\n\"Do you remember, mamma, what the admiral used to say of her?\"\n\n\"The admiral, my dear, tried to borrow her money, as he did\neverybody's, and when she wouldn't give him any, then he said severe\nthings. The poor admiral was never to be trusted in such matters.\"\n\n\"I don't think Frank would like it,\" said Ellinor. The plan was this.\nLady Linlithgow, who, through her brother-in-law, the late Admiral\nGreystock, was connected with the dean's family, had made known\nher desire to have a new companion for six months. The lady was to\nbe treated like a lady, but was to have no salary. Her travelling\nexpenses were to be paid for her, and no duties were to be expected\nfrom her, except that of talking and listening to the countess.\n\n\"I really think it's the very thing for her,\" said Mrs. Greystock.\n\"It's not like being a governess. She's not to have any salary.\"\n\n\"I don't know whether that makes it better, mamma.\"\n\n\"It would just be a visit to Lady Linlithgow. It is that which makes\nthe difference, my dear.\"\n\nEllinor felt sure that her brother would not hear of such an\nengagement,--but he did hear of it, and, after various objections,\ngave a sort of sanction to it. It was not to be pressed upon Lucy if\nLucy disliked it. Lady Linlithgow was to be made to understand that\nLucy might leave whenever she pleased. It was to be an invitation,\nwhich Lucy might accept if she were so minded. Lucy's position as an\nhonourable guest was to be assured to her. It was thought better that\nLady Linlithgow should not be told of Lucy's engagement unless she\nasked questions;--or unless Lucy should choose to tell her. Every\nprecaution was to be taken, and then Frank gave his sanction. He\ncould understand, he said, that it might be inexpedient that Lucy\nshould come at once to the deanery, as,--were she to do so,--she must\nremain there till her marriage, let the time be ever so long. \"It\nmight be two years,\" said the mother. \"Hardly so long as that,\" said\nthe son. \"I don't think it would be--quite fair--to papa,\" said the\nmother. It was well that the argument was used behind the dean's\nback, as, had it been made in his hearing, the dean would have upset\nit at once. The dean was so short-sighted and imprudent, that he\nwould have professed delight at the idea of having Lucy Morris as\na resident at the deanery. Frank acceded to the argument,--and was\nashamed of himself for acceding. Ellinor did not accede, nor did her\nsisters, but it was necessary that they should yield. Mrs. Greystock\nat once wrote to Lady Linlithgow, and Frank wrote by the same post\nto Lucy Morris. \"As there must be a year's delay,\" he wrote, \"we all\nhere think it best that your visit to us should be postponed for a\nwhile. But if you object to the Linlithgow plan, say so at once. You\nshall be asked to do nothing disagreeable.\" He found the letter very\ndifficult to write. He knew that she ought to have been welcomed\nat once to Bobsborough. And he knew, too, the reason on which his\nmother's objection was founded. But it might be two years before he\ncould possibly marry Lucy Morris;--or it might be three. Would it be\nproper that she should be desired to make the deanery her home for\nso long and so indefinite a time? And when an engagement was for so\nlong, could it be well that everybody should know it,--as everybody\nwould if Lucy were to take up her residence permanently at the\ndeanery? Some consideration, certainly, was due to his father.\n\nAnd, moreover, it was absolutely necessary that he and Lizzie Eustace\nshould understand each other as to that mutual pledge of truth which\nhad passed between them.\n\nIn the meantime he received the following letter from Messrs.\nCamperdown:--\n\n\n   62, New Square, Lincoln's Inn,\n   15 September, 18--\n\n   DEAR SIR,\n\n   After what passed in our chambers the other day, we think\n   it best to let you know that we have been instructed by\n   the executor of the late Sir Florian Eustace to file a\n   bill in Chancery against the widow, Lady Eustace, for\n   the recovery of valuable diamonds. You will oblige us\n   by making the necessary communication to her ladyship,\n   and will perhaps tell us the names of her ladyship's\n   solicitors.\n\n   We are, dear sir,\n   Your very obedient servants,\n\n   CAMPERDOWN & SON.\n\n   F. Greystock, Esq., M.P.\n\n\nA few days after the receipt of this letter Frank started for\nScotland.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\nFrank Greystock's Second Visit to Portray\n\n\nOn this occasion Frank Greystock went down to Portray Castle with the\nintention of staying at the house during the very short time that he\nwould remain in Scotland. He was going there solely on his cousin's\nbusiness,--with no view to grouse-shooting or other pleasure, and he\npurposed remaining but a very short time,--perhaps only one night.\nHis cousin, moreover, had spoken of having guests with her, in which\ncase there could be no tinge of impropriety in his doing so. And\nwhether she had guests, or whether she had not, what difference could\nit really make? Mr. Andrew Gowran had already seen what there was\nto see, and could do all the evil that could be done. He could, if\nhe were so minded, spread reports in the neighbourhood, and might,\nperhaps, have the power of communicating what he had discovered to\nthe Eustace faction,--John Eustace, Mr. Camperdown, and Lord Fawn.\nThat evil, if it were an evil, must be encountered with absolute\nindifference. So he went direct to the castle, and was received\nquietly, but very graciously, by his cousin Lizzie.\n\nThere were no guests then staying at Portray; but that very\ndistinguished lady, Mrs. Carbuncle, with her niece, Miss Roanoke, had\nbeen there; as had also that very well-known nobleman, Lord George de\nBruce Carruthers. Lord George and Mrs. Carbuncle were in the habit\nof seeing a good deal of each other, though, as all the world knew,\nthere was nothing between them but the simplest friendship. And Sir\nGriffin Tewett had also been there, a young baronet who was supposed\nto be enamoured of that most gorgeous of beauties, Lucinda Roanoke.\nOf all these grand friends,--friends with whom Lizzie had become\nacquainted in London,--nothing further need be said here, as they\nwere not at the castle when Frank arrived. When he came, whether by\npremeditated plan or by the chance of circumstances, Lizzie had no\none with her at Portray,--except the faithful Macnulty.\n\n\"I thought to have found you with all the world here,\" said\nFrank,--the faithful Macnulty being then present.\n\n\"Well,--we have had people, but only for a couple of days. They\nare all coming again, but not till November. You hunt;--don't you,\nFrank?\"\n\n\"I have no time for hunting. Why do you ask?\"\n\n\"I'm going to hunt. It's a long way to go,--ten or twelve miles\ngenerally; but almost everybody hunts here. Mrs. Carbuncle is coming\nagain, and she is about the best lady in England after hounds;--so\nthey tell me. And Lord George is coming again.\"\n\n\"Who is Lord George?\"\n\n\"You remember Lord George Carruthers, whom we all knew in London?\"\n\n\"What,--the tall man with the hollow eyes and the big whiskers, whose\nlife is a mystery to every one? Is he coming?\"\n\n\"I like him, just because he isn't a ditto to every man one meets.\nAnd Sir Griffin Tewett is coming.\"\n\n\"Who is a ditto to everybody.\"\n\n\"Well;--yes; poor Sir Griffin! The truth is, he is awfully smitten\nwith Mrs. Carbuncle's niece.\"\n\n\"Don't you go match-making, Lizzie,\" said Frank. \"That Sir Griffin is\na fool, we will all allow; but it's my belief he has wit enough to\nmake himself pass off as a man of fortune, with very little to back\nit. He's at law with his mother, at law with his sisters, and at law\nwith his younger brother.\"\n\n\"If he were at law with his great-grandmother, it would be nothing to\nme, Frank. She has her aunt to take care of her, and Sir Griffin is\ncoming with Lord George.\"\n\n\"You don't mean to put up all their horses, Lizzie?\"\n\n\"Well, not all. Lord George and Sir Griffin are to keep theirs at\nTroon, or Kilmarnock, or somewhere. The ladies will bring two apiece,\nand I shall have two of my own.\"\n\n\"And carriage-horses and hacks?\"\n\n\"The carriage-horses are here,--of course.\"\n\n\"It will cost you a great deal of money, Lizzie.\"\n\n\"That's just what I tell her,\" said Miss Macnulty.\n\n\"I've been living here, not spending one shilling, for the last two\nmonths,\" said Lizzie, \"and all for the sake of economy; yet people\nthink that no woman was ever left so rich. Surely I can afford to see\na few friends for one month in the year. If I find I can't afford\nso much as that, I shall let the place, and go and live abroad\nsomewhere. It's too much to suppose that a woman should shut herself\nup here for six or eight months and see nobody all the time.\"\n\nOn that, the day of Frank's arrival, not a word was said about the\nnecklace, nor of Lord Fawn, nor of that mutual pledge which had been\ntaken and given down among the rocks. Frank, before dinner, went out\nabout the place, that he might see how things were going on, and\nobserve whether the widow was being ill-treated and unfairly eaten up\nby her dependants. He was, too, a little curious as to a matter as\nto which his curiosity was soon relieved. He had hardly reached the\nout-buildings which lay behind the kitchen-gardens on his way to\nthe Portray woods, before he encountered Andy Gowran. That faithful\nadherent of the family raised his hand to his cap and bobbed his\nhead, and then silently, and with renewed diligence, applied himself\nto the job which he had in hand. The gate of the little yard in\nwhich the cow-shed stood was off its hinges, and Andy was resetting\nthe post and making the fence tight and tidy. Frank stood a moment\nwatching him, and then asked after his health. \"'Deed am I nae that\nto boost about in the way of bodily heelth, Muster Greystock. I've\njust o'er mony things to tent to, to tent to my ain sell as a prudent\nmon ought. It's airly an' late wi' me, Muster Greystock; and the\nlumbagy just a' o'er a mon isn't the pleasantest freend in the\nwarld.\" Frank said that he was sorry to hear so bad an account of Mr.\nGowran's health, and passed on. It was not for him to refer to the\nlittle scene in which Mr. Gowran had behaved so badly and had shaken\nhis head. If the misbehaviour had been condoned by Lady Eustace, the\nless that he said about it the better. Then he went on through the\nwoods, and was well aware that Mr. Gowran's fostering care had not\nbeen abated by his disapproval of his mistress. The fences had been\nrepaired since Frank was there, and stones had been laid on the road\nor track over which was to be carried away the under-wood which it\nwould be Lady Eustace's privilege to cut during the coming winter.\n\nFrank was not alone for one moment with his cousin during that\nevening, but in the presence of Miss Macnulty all the circumstances\nof the necklace were discussed. \"Of course it is my own,\" said Lady\nEustace, standing up,--\"my own to do just what I please with. If they\ngo on like this with me, they will almost tempt me to sell it for\nwhat it will fetch,--just to prove to them that I can do so. I have\nhalf a mind to sell it, and then send them the money, and tell them\nto put it by for my little Flory. Would not that serve them right,\nFrank?\"\n\n\"I don't think I'd do that, Lizzie.\"\n\n\"Why not? You always tell me what not to do, but you never say what I\nought!\"\n\n\"That is because I am so wise and prudent. If you were to attempt to\nsell the diamonds they would stop you, and would not give you credit\nfor the generous purpose afterwards.\"\n\n\"They wouldn't stop you if you sold the ring you wear.\" The ring had\nbeen given to him by Lucy after their engagement, and was the only\npresent she had ever made him. It had been purchased out of her own\nearnings, and had been put on his finger by her own hand. Either\nfrom accident or craft he had not worn it when he had been before at\nPortray, and Lizzie had at once observed it as a thing she had never\nseen before. She knew well that he would not buy such a ring. Who\nhad given him the ring? Frank almost blushed as he looked down at\nthe trinket, and Lizzie was sure that it had been given by that sly\nlittle creeping thing, Lucy. \"Let me look at the ring,\" she said.\n\"Nobody could stop you if you chose to sell this to me.\"\n\n\"Little things are always less troublesome than big things,\" he said.\n\n\"What is the price?\" she asked.\n\n\"It is not in the market, Lizzie. Nor should your diamonds be there.\nYou must be content to let them take what legal steps they may think\nfit, and defend your property. After that you can do as you please;\nbut keep them safe till the thing is settled. If I were you I would\nhave them at the bankers.\"\n\n\"Yes;--and then when I asked for them be told that they couldn't be\ngiven up to me, because of Mr. Camperdown or the Lord Chancellor.\nAnd what's the good of a thing locked up? You wear your ring;--why\nshouldn't I wear my necklace?\"\n\n\"I have nothing to say against it.\"\n\n\"It isn't that I care for such things. Do I, Julia?\"\n\n\"All ladies like them, I suppose,\" said that stupidest and most\nstubborn of all humble friends, Miss Macnulty.\n\n\"I don't like them at all, and you know I don't. I hate them. They\nhave been the misery of my life. Oh, how they have tormented me! Even\nwhen I am asleep I dream about them, and think that people steal\nthem. They have never given me one moment's happiness. When I have\nthem on I am always fearing that Camperdown and Son are behind me and\nare going to clutch them. And I think too well of myself to believe\nthat anybody will care more for me because of a necklace. The only\ngood they have ever done me has been to save me from a man who I now\nknow never cared for me. But they are mine;--and therefore I choose\nto keep them. Though I am only a woman I have an idea of my own\nrights, and will defend them as far as they go. If you say I ought\nnot to sell them, Frank, I'll keep them; but I'll wear them as\ncommonly as you do that gage d'amour which you carry on your finger.\nNobody shall ever see me without them. I won't go to any old\ndowager's tea-party without them. Mr. John Eustace has chosen to\naccuse me of stealing them.\"\n\n\"I don't think John Eustace has ever said a word about them,\" said\nFrank.\n\n\"Mr. Camperdown, then;--the people who choose to call themselves\nthe guardians and protectors of my boy, as if I were not his best\nguardian and protector! I'll show them at any rate that I'm not\nashamed of my booty. I don't see why I should lock them up in a musty\nold bank. Why don't you send your ring to the bank?\" Frank could\nnot but feel that she did it all very well. In the first place she\nwas very pretty in the display of her half-mock indignation. Though\nshe used some strong words, she used them with an air that carried\nthem off and left no impression that she had been either vulgar or\nviolent. And then, though the indignation was half mock, it was also\nhalf real, and her courage and spirit were attractive. Greystock had\nat last taught himself to think that Mr. Camperdown was not justified\nin the claim which he made, and that in consequence of that unjust\nclaim Lizzie Eustace had been subjected to ill-usage. \"Did you ever\nsee this bone of contention,\" she asked;--\"this fair Helen for which\nGreeks and Romans are to fight?\"\n\n\"I never saw the necklace, if you mean that.\"\n\n\"I'll fetch it. You ought to see it, as you have to talk about it so\noften.\"\n\n\"Can I get it?\" asked Miss Macnulty.\n\n\"Heaven and earth! To suppose that I should ever keep them under\nless than seven keys, and that there should be any of the locks that\nanybody should be able to open except myself!\"\n\n\"And where are the seven keys?\" asked Frank.\n\n\"Next to my heart,\" said Lizzie, putting her hand on her left side.\n\"And when I sleep they are always tied round my neck in a bag, and\nthe bag never escapes from my grasp. And I have such a knife under my\npillow, ready for Mr. Camperdown should he come to seize them!\" Then\nshe ran out of the room, and in a couple of minutes returned with the\nnecklace hanging loose in her hand. It was part of her little play\nto show by her speed that the close locking of the jewels was a\njoke, and that the ornament, precious as it was, received at her\nhands no other treatment than might any indifferent feminine bauble.\nNevertheless within those two minutes she had contrived to unlock\nthe heavy iron case which always stood beneath the foot of her bed.\n\"There,\" she said, chucking the necklace across the table to Frank,\nso that he was barely able to catch it. \"There is ten thousand\npounds' worth, as they tell me. Perhaps you will not believe me when\nI say that I should have the greatest satisfaction in the world in\nthrowing them out among those blue waves yonder, did I not think that\nCamperdown and Son would fish them up again.\"\n\nFrank spread the necklace on the table, and stood up to look at it,\nwhile Miss Macnulty came and gazed at the jewels over his shoulder.\n\"And that is worth ten thousand pounds,\" said he.\n\n\"So people say.\"\n\n\"And your husband gave it you just as another man gives a trinket\nthat costs ten shillings!\"\n\n\"Just as Lucy Morris gave you that ring.\"\n\nHe smiled, but took no other notice of the accusation. \"I am so poor\na man,\" said he, \"that this string of stones, which you throw about\nthe room like a child's toy, would be the making of me.\"\n\n\"Take it and be made,\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"It seems an awful thing to me to have so much value in my hands,\"\nsaid Miss Macnulty, who had lifted the necklace off the table. \"It\nwould buy an estate; wouldn't it?\"\n\n\"It would buy the honourable estate of matrimony if it belonged to\nmany women,\" said Lizzie,--\"but it hasn't had just that effect with\nme;--has it, Frank?\"\n\n\"You haven't used it with that view yet.\"\n\n\"Will you have it, Frank?\" she said. \"Take it with all its\nencumbrances and weight of cares. Take it with all the burthen of\nMessrs. Camperdown's lawsuits upon it. You shall be as welcome to it\nas flowers were ever welcomed in May.\"\n\n\"The encumbrances are too heavy,\" said Frank.\n\n\"You prefer a little ring.\"\n\n\"Very much.\"\n\n\"I don't doubt but you're right,\" said Lizzie. \"Who fears to rise\nwill hardly get a fall. But there they are for you to look at, and\nthere they shall remain for the rest of the evening.\" So saying, she\nclasped the string round Miss Macnulty's throat. \"How do you feel,\nJulia, with an estate upon your neck? Five hundred acres at twenty\npounds an acre. Let us call it five hundred pounds a year. That's\nabout it.\" Miss Macnulty looked as though she did not like it, but\nshe stood for a time bearing the precious burthen, while Frank\nexplained to his cousin that she could hardly buy land to pay her\nfive per cent. They were then taken off and left lying on the table\ntill Lady Eustace took them with her as she went to bed. \"I do feel\nso like some naughty person in the 'Arabian Nights,'\" she said, \"who\nhas got some great treasure that always brings him into trouble; but\nhe can't get rid of it, because some spirit has given it to him. At\nlast some morning it turns into slate stones, and then he has to be a\nwater-carrier, and is happy ever afterwards, and marries the king's\ndaughter. What sort of a king's son will there be for me when this\nturns into slate stones? Good night, Frank.\" Then she went off with\nher diamonds and her bed-candle.\n\nOn the following day Frank suggested that there should be a business\nconversation. \"That means that I am to sit silent and obedient while\nyou lecture me,\" she said. But she submitted, and they went together\ninto the little sitting-room which looked out over the sea,--the room\nwhere she kept her Shelley and her Byron, and practised her music\nand did water-colours, and sat, sometimes, dreaming of a Corsair.\n\"And now, my gravest of Mentors, what must a poor ignorant female\nTelemachus do, so that the world may not trample on her too heavily?\"\nHe began by telling her what had happened between himself and\nLord Fawn, and recommended her to write to that unhappy nobleman,\nreturning any present that she might have received from him, and\nexpressing, with some mild but intelligible sarcasm, her regret that\ntheir paths should have crossed each other. \"I've worse in store for\nhis lordship than that,\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"Do you mean by any personal interview?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"I think you are wrong, Lizzie.\"\n\n\"Of course you do. Men have become so soft themselves, that they no\nlonger dare to think even of punishing those who behave badly, and\nthey expect women to be softer and more fain\u00c3\u00a9ant than themselves. I\nhave been ill-used.\"\n\n\"Certainly you have.\"\n\n\"And I will be revenged. Look here, Frank; if your view of these\nthings is altogether different from mine, let us drop the subject.\nOf all living human beings you are the one that is most to me now.\nPerhaps you are more than any other ever was. But, even for you, I\ncannot alter my nature. Even for you I would not alter it if I could.\nThat man has injured me, and all the world knows it. I will have\nmy revenge, and all the world shall know that. I did wrong;--I am\nsensible enough of that.\"\n\n\"What wrong do you mean?\"\n\n\"I told a man whom I never loved that I would marry him. God knows\nthat I have been punished.\"\n\n\"Perhaps, Lizzie, it is better as it is.\"\n\n\"A great deal better. I will tell you now that I could never induce\nmyself to go into church with that man as his bride. With a man I\ndidn't love I might have done so, but not with a man I despised.\"\n\n\"You have been saved, then, from a greater evil.\"\n\n\"Yes;--but not the less is his injury to me. It is not because he\ndespises me that he rejects me;--nor is it because he thought that I\nhad taken property that was not my own.\"\n\n\"Why then?\"\n\n\"Because he was afraid the world would say that I had done so. Poor\nshallow creature! But he shall be punished.\"\n\n\"I do not know how you can punish him.\"\n\n\"Leave that to me. I have another thing to do much more difficult.\"\nShe paused, looking for a moment up into his face, and then turning\nher eyes upon the ground. As he said nothing, she went on. \"I have to\nexcuse myself to you for having accepted him.\"\n\n\"I have never blamed you.\"\n\n\"Not in words. How should you? But if you have not blamed me in your\nheart, I despise you. I know you have. I have seen it in your eyes\nwhen you have counselled me, either to take the poor creature or to\nleave him. Speak out, now, like a man. Is it not so?\"\n\n\"I never thought you loved him.\"\n\n\"Loved him! Is there anything in him or about him that a woman could\nlove? Is he not a poor social stick;--a bit of half-dead wood, good\nto make a post of, if one wants a post? I did want a post so sorely\nthen!\"\n\n\"I don't see why.\"\n\n\"You don't?\"\n\n\"No, indeed. It was natural that you should be inclined to marry\nagain.\"\n\n\"Natural that I should be inclined to marry again! And is that\nall? It is hard sometimes to see whether men are thick-witted, or\nhypocrites so perfect that they seem to be so. I cannot bring myself\nto think you thick-witted, Frank.\"\n\n\"Then I must be the perfect hypocrite,--of course.\"\n\n\"You believed I accepted Lord Fawn because it was natural that I\nshould wish to marry again! Frank, you believed nothing of the kind.\nI accepted him in my anger, in my misery, in my despair, because\nI had expected you to come to me,--and you had not come!\" She had\nthrown herself now into a chair, and sat looking at him. \"You had\ntold me that you would come, and you had stayed away. It was you,\nFrank, that I wanted to punish then;--but there was no punishment in\nit for you. When is it to be, Frank?\"\n\n\"When is what to be?\" he asked, in a low voice, all but dumb-founded.\nHow was he to put an end to this conversation, and what was he to say\nto her?\n\n\"Your marriage with that little wizened thing who gave you the\nring--that prim morsel of feminine propriety who has been clever\nenough to make you believe that her morality would suffice to make\nyou happy.\"\n\n\"I will not hear Lucy Morris abused, Lizzie.\"\n\n\"Is that abuse? Is it abuse to say that she is moral and proper? But,\nsir, I shall abuse her. I know her for what she is, while your eyes\nare sealed. She is wise and moral, and decorous and prim; but she is\na hypocrite, and has no touch of real heart in her composition. Not\nabuse her when she has robbed me of all--all--all that I have in the\nworld! Go to her. You had better go at once. I did not mean to say\nall this, but it has been said, and you must leave me. I, at any\nrate, cannot play the hypocrite;--I wish I could.\" He rose and came\nto her, and attempted to take her hand, but she flung away from him.\n\"No!\" she said--\"never again; never, unless you will tell me that the\npromise you made me when we were down on the sea-shore was a true\npromise. Was that truth, sir, or was it a--lie?\"\n\n\"Lizzie, do not use such a word as that to me.\"\n\n\"I cannot stand picking my words when the whole world is going round\nwith me, and my very brain is on fire. What is it to me what my words\nare? Say one syllable to me, and every word I utter again while\nbreath is mine shall be spoken to do you pleasure. If you cannot say\nit, it is nothing to me what you or any one may think of my words.\nYou know my secret, and I care not who else knows it. At any rate, I\ncan die!\" Then she paused a moment, and after that stalked steadily\nout of the room.\n\nThat afternoon Frank took a long walk by himself over the mountains,\nnearly to the Cottage and back again; and on his return was informed\nthat Lady Eustace was ill, and had gone to bed. At any rate, she was\ntoo unwell to come down to dinner. He, therefore, and Miss Macnulty\nsat down to dine, and passed the evening together without other\ncompanionship. Frank had resolved during his walk that he would leave\nPortray the next day; but had hardly resolved upon anything else. One\nthing, however, seemed certain to him. He was engaged to marry Lucy\nMorris, and to that engagement he must be true. His cousin was very\ncharming,--and had never looked so lovely in his eyes as when she had\nbeen confessing her love for him. And he had wondered at and admired\nher courage, her power of language, and her force. He could not quite\nforget how useful would be her income to him. And, added to this,\nthere was present to him an unwholesome feeling,--ideas absolutely at\nvariance with those better ideas which had prompted him when he was\nwriting his offer to Lucy Morris in his chambers,--that a woman such\nas was his cousin Lizzie was fitter to be the wife of a man thrown,\nas he must be, into the world, than a dear, quiet, domestic little\ngirl such as Lucy Morris. But to Lucy Morris he was engaged, and\ntherefore there was an end of it.\n\nThe next morning he sent his love to his cousin, asking whether he\nshould see her before he went. It was still necessary that he should\nknow what attorneys to employ on her behalf if the threatened bill\nwere filed by Messrs. Camperdown. Then he suggested a firm in his\nnote. Might he put the case into the hands of Mr. Townsend, who\nwas a friend of his own? There came back to him a scrap of paper,\nan old envelope, on which were written the names of Mowbray and\nMopus;--Mowbray and Mopus in a large scrawling hand, and with pencil.\nHe put the scrap of paper into his pocket, feeling that he could not\nremonstrate with her at this moment, and was prepared to depart, when\nthere came a message to him. Lady Eustace was still unwell, but had\nrisen; and if it were not giving him too much trouble, would see him\nbefore he went. He followed the messenger to the same little room,\nlooking out upon the sea, and then found her, dressed indeed, but\nwith a white morning wrapper on, and with hair loose over her\nshoulders. Her eyes were red with weeping, and her face was pale, and\nthin, and woe-begone. \"I am so sorry that you are ill, Lizzie,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"Yes, I am ill;--sometimes very ill; but what does it matter? I did\nnot send for you, Frank, to speak of aught so trivial as that. I have\na favour to ask.\"\n\n\"Of course I will grant it.\"\n\n\"It is your forgiveness for my conduct yesterday.\"\n\n\"Oh, Lizzie!\"\n\n\"Say that you forgive me. Say it!\"\n\n\"How can I forgive where there has been no fault?\"\n\n\"There has been fault. Say that you forgive me.\" And she stamped her\nfoot as she demanded his pardon.\n\n\"I do forgive you,\" he said.\n\n\"And now, one farewell.\" She then threw herself upon his breast and\nkissed him. \"Now, go,\" she said; \"go, and come no more to me, unless\nyou would see me mad. May God Almighty bless you, and make you\nhappy!\" As she uttered this prayer she held the door in her hand, and\nthere was nothing for him but to leave her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\nMr. and Mrs. Hittaway in Scotland\n\n\nA great many people go to Scotland in the autumn. When you have\nyour autumn holiday in hand to dispose of it, there is nothing more\naristocratic that you can do than go to Scotland. Dukes are more\nplentiful there than in Pall Mall, and you will meet an earl or at\nleast a lord on every mountain. Of course, if you merely travel\nabout from inn to inn, and neither have a moor of your own nor stay\nwith any great friend, you don't quite enjoy the cream of it; but\nto go to Scotland in August and stay there, perhaps, till the end\nof September, is about the most certain step you can take towards\nautumnal fashion. Switzerland and the Tyrol, and even Italy, are all\nredolent of Mr. Cook, and in those beautiful lands you become subject\nat least to suspicion.\n\nBy no persons was the duty of adhering to the best side of society\nmore clearly appreciated than by Mr. and Mrs. Hittaway of Warwick\nSquare. Mr. Hittaway was Chairman of the Board of Civil Appeals, and\nwas a man who quite understood that there are chairmen--and chairmen.\nHe could name to you three or four men holding responsible permanent\nofficial positions quite as good as that he filled in regard to\nsalary,--which, as he often said of his own, was a mere nothing, just\na poor two thousand pounds a year, not as much as a grocer would make\nin a decent business,--but they were simply head clerks and nothing\nmore. Nobody knew anything of them. They had no names. You did not\nmeet them anywhere. Cabinet ministers never heard of them; and nobody\nout of their own offices ever consulted them. But there are others,\nand Mr. Hittaway felt greatly conscious that he was one of them,\nwho move altogether in a different sphere. One minister of State\nwould ask another whether Hittaway had been consulted on this or on\nthat measure;--so at least the Hittawayites were in the habit of\nreporting. The names of Mr. and Mrs. Hittaway were constantly in the\npapers. They were invited to evening gatherings at the houses of both\nthe alternate Prime Ministers. They were to be seen at fashionable\ngatherings up the river. They attended concerts at Buckingham Palace.\nOnce a year they gave a dinner-party which was inserted in the\n\"Morning Post.\" On such occasions at least one Cabinet Minister\nalways graced the board. In fact, Mr. Hittaway, as Chairman of the\nBoard of Civil Appeals, was somebody; and Mrs. Hittaway, as his wife\nand as sister to a peer, was somebody also. The reader will remember\nthat Mrs. Hittaway had been a Fawn before she married.\n\nThere is this drawback upon the happy condition which Mr. Hittaway\nhad achieved,--that it demands a certain expenditure. Let nobody\ndream that he can be somebody without having to pay for that\nhonour;--unless, indeed, he be a clergyman. When you go to a concert\nat Buckingham Palace you pay nothing, it is true, for your ticket;\nand a Cabinet Minister dining with you does not eat or drink more\nthan your old friend Jones the attorney. But in some insidious,\nunforeseen manner,--in a way that can only be understood after much\nexperience,--these luxuries of fashion do make a heavy pull on a\nmodest income. Mrs. Hittaway knew this thoroughly, having much\nexperience, and did make her fight bravely. For Mr. Hittaway's income\nwas no more than modest. A few thousand pounds he had of his own when\nhe married, and his Clara had brought to him the unpretending sum of\nfifteen hundred. But, beyond that, the poor official salary,--which\nwas less than what a decent grocer would make,--was their all.\nThe house in Warwick Square they had prudently purchased on their\nmarriage,--when houses in Warwick Square were cheaper than they are\nnow,--and there they carried on their battle, certainly with success.\nBut two thousand a year does not go very far in Warwick Square,\neven though you sit rent free, if you have a family and absolutely\nmust keep a carriage. It therefore resulted that when Mr. and Mrs.\nHittaway went to Scotland, which they would endeavour to do every\nyear, it was very important that they should accomplish their\naristocratic holiday as visitors at the house of some aristocratic\nfriend. So well had they played their cards in this respect, that\nthey seldom failed altogether. In one year they had been the guests\nof a great marquis quite in the north, and that had been a very\nglorious year. To talk of Stackallan was, indeed, a thing of beauty.\nBut in that year Mr. Hittaway had made himself very useful in London.\nSince that they had been at delicious shooting lodges in Ross and\nInverness-shire, had visited a millionaire at his palace amidst the\nArgyle mountains, had been f\u00c3\u00aated in a western island, had been bored\nby a Dundee dowager, and put up with a Lothian laird. But the thing\nhad been almost always done, and the Hittaways were known as people\nthat went to Scotland. He could handle a gun, and was clever enough\nnever to shoot a keeper. She could read aloud, could act a little,\ncould talk or hold her tongue; and let her hosts be who they would\nand as mighty as you please, never caused them trouble by seeming\nto be out of their circle, and on that account requiring peculiar\nattention.\n\nOn this occasion Mr. and Mrs. Hittaway were the guests of old Lady\nPierrepoint, in Dumfries. There was nothing special to recommend Lady\nPierrepoint except that she had a large house and a good income,\nand that she liked to have people with her of whom everybody knew\nsomething. So far was Lady Pierrepoint from being high in the\nHittaway world, that Mrs. Hittaway felt herself called upon to\nexplain to her friends that she was forced to go to Dumdum House by\nthe duties of old friendship. Dear old Lady Pierrepoint had been\ninsisting on it for the last ten years. And there was this advantage,\nthat Dumfriesshire is next to Ayrshire, that Dumdum was not very\nfar,--some twenty or thirty miles,--from Portray, and that she might\nlearn something about Lizzie Eustace in her country house.\n\nIt was nearly the end of August when the Hittaways left London to\nstay an entire month with Lady Pierrepoint. Mr. Hittaway had very\nfrequently explained his defalcation as to fashion,--in that he was\nremaining in London for three weeks after Parliament had broken\nup,--by the peculiar exigencies of the Board of Appeals in that year.\nTo one or two very intimate friends Mrs. Hittaway had hinted that\neverything must be made to give way to this horrid business of Fawn's\nmarriage. \"Whatever happens, and at whatever cost, that must be\nstopped,\" she had ventured to say to Lady Glencora Palliser,--who,\nhowever, could hardly be called one of her very intimate friends. \"I\ndon't see it at all,\" said Lady Glencora. \"I think Lady Eustace is\nvery nice. And why shouldn't she marry Lord Fawn if she's engaged\nto him?\" \"But you have heard of the necklace, Lady Glencora?\" \"Yes,\nI've heard of it. I wish anybody would come to me and try and get my\ndiamonds! They should hear what I would say.\" Mrs. Hittaway greatly\nadmired Lady Glencora, but not the less was she determined to\npersevere.\n\nHad Lord Fawn been altogether candid and open with his family at\nthis time, some trouble might have been saved; for he had almost\naltogether resolved that, let the consequences be what they might, he\nwould not marry Lizzie Eustace. But he was afraid to say this even to\nhis own sister. He had promised to marry the woman, and he must walk\nvery warily, or the objurgations of the world would be too many for\nhim. \"It must depend altogether on her conduct, Clara,\" he had said\nwhen last his sister had persecuted him on the subject. She was\nnot, however, sorry to have an opportunity of learning something\nof the lady's doings. Mr. Hittaway had more than once called on Mr.\nCamperdown. \"Yes,\" Mr. Camperdown had said in answer to a question\nfrom Lord Fawn's brother-in-law; \"she would play old gooseberry with\nthe property if we hadn't some one to look after it. There's a fellow\nnamed Gowran who has lived there all his life, and we depend very\nmuch upon him.\"\n\nIt is certainly true, that as to many points of conduct, women are\nless nice than men. Mr. Hittaway would not probably have condescended\nhimself to employ espionage, but Mrs. Hittaway was less scrupulous.\nShe actually went down to Troon and had an interview with Mr. Gowran,\nusing freely the names of Mr. Camperdown and of Lord Fawn; and some\nten days afterwards Mr. Gowran travelled as far as Dumfries, and\nDumdum, and had an interview with Mrs. Hittaway. The result of all\nthis, and of further inquiries, will be shown by the following letter\nfrom Mrs. Hittaway to her sister Amelia:--\n\n\n   Dumdum, 9th September, 18--.\n\n   MY DEAR AMELIA,\n\n   Here we are, and here we have to remain to the end of the\n   month. Of course it suits, and all that; but it is awfully\n   dull. Richmond for this time of the year is a paradise to\n   it; and as for coming to Scotland every autumn, I am sick\n   of it. Only what is one to do if one lives in London? If\n   it wasn't for Orlando and the children, I'd brazen it out,\n   and let people say what they pleased. As for health, I'm\n   never so well as at home, and I do like having my own\n   things about me. Orlando has literally nothing to do here.\n   There is no shooting, except pheasants, and that doesn't\n   begin till October.\n\n   But I'm very glad I've come as to Frederic, and the more\n   so, as I have learned the truth as to that Mr. Greystock.\n   She, Lady Eustace, is a bad creature in every way. She\n   still pretends that she is engaged to Frederic, and tells\n   everybody that the marriage is not broken off, and yet she\n   has her cousin with her, making love to him in the most\n   indecent way. People used to say in her favour that at any\n   rate she never flirted. I never quite know what people\n   mean when they talk of flirting. But you may take my word\n   for it that she allows her cousin to embrace her, and\n   _embraces him_. I would not say it if I could not prove\n   it. It is horrible to think of it, when one remembers that\n   she is almost justified in saying that Frederic is engaged\n   to her.\n\n   No doubt he was engaged to her. It was a great misfortune,\n   but, thank God, is not yet past remedy. He has some\n   foolish feeling of what he calls honour; as if a man can\n   be bound in honour to marry a woman who has deceived him\n   in every point! She still sticks to the diamonds,--if\n   she has not sold them, as I believe she has; and Mr.\n   Camperdown is going to bring an action against her in\n   the High Court of Chancery. But still Frederic will not\n   absolutely declare the thing off. I feel, therefore, that\n   it is my duty to let him know what I have learned. I\n   should be the last to stir in such a matter unless I was\n   sure I could prove it. But I don't quite like to write to\n   Frederic. Will mamma see him, and tell him what I say? Of\n   course you will show this letter to mamma. If not, I must\n   postpone it till I am in town;--but I think it would come\n   better from mamma. Mamma may be sure that she is a bad\n   woman.\n\n   And now what do you think of your Mr. Greystock? As sure\n   as I am here he was seen with his arm round his cousin's\n   waist, sitting out of doors,--_kissing her!_ I was never\n   taken in by that story of his marrying Lucy Morris. He is\n   the last man in the world to marry a governess. He is over\n   head and ears in debt, and if he marries at all, he must\n   marry some one with money. I really think that mamma,\n   and you, and all of you have been soft about that girl.\n   I believe she has been a good governess,--that is, good\n   after mamma's easy fashion; and I don't for a moment\n   suppose that she is doing anything underhand. But a\n   governess with a lover never does suit, and I'm sure it\n   won't suit in this case. If I were you I would tell her.\n   I think it would be the best charity. Whether they mean\n   to marry I can't tell,--Mr. Greystock, that is, and this\n   woman; _but they ought to mean it_;--that's all.\n\n   Let me know at once whether mamma will see Frederic, and\n   speak to him openly. She is quite at liberty to use my\n   name; only nobody but mamma should see this letter.\n\n   Love to them all,\n   Your most affectionate sister,\n\n   CLARA HITTAWAY.\n\n\nIn writing to Amelia instead of to her mother, Mrs. Hittaway was sure\nthat she was communicating her ideas to at least two persons at Fawn\nCourt, and that therefore there would be discussion. Had she written\nto her mother, her mother might probably have held her peace, and\ndone nothing.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\n\"It Won't Be True\"\n\n\nMrs. Greystock, in making her proposition respecting Lady Linlithgow,\nwrote to Lady Fawn, and by the same post Frank wrote to Lucy. But\nbefore those letters reached Fawn Court there had come that other\ndreadful letter from Mrs. Hittaway. The consternation caused at Fawn\nCourt in respect to Mr. Greystock's treachery almost robbed of its\nimportance the suggestion made as to Lord Fawn. Could it be possible\nthat this man, who had so openly and in so manly a manner engaged\nhimself to Lucy Morris, should now be proposing to himself a marriage\nwith his rich cousin? Lady Fawn did not believe that it was possible.\nClara had not seen those horrid things with her own eyes, and other\npeople might be liars. But Amelia shook her head. Amelia evidently\nbelieved that all manner of iniquities were possible to man. \"You\nsee, mamma, the sacrifice he was making was so very great!\" \"But he\nmade it!\" pleaded Lady Fawn. \"No, mamma, he said he would make it.\nMen do these things. It is very horrid, but I think they do them more\nnow than they used to. It seems to me that nobody cares now what he\ndoes, if he's not to be put into prison.\" It was resolved between\nthese two wise ones that nothing at the present should be said to\nLucy or to any one of the family. They would wait awhile, and in\nthe meantime they attempted,--as far as it was possible to make the\nattempt without express words,--to let Lucy understand that she might\nremain at Fawn Court if she pleased. While this was going on, Lord\nFawn did come down once again, and on that occasion Lucy simply\nabsented herself from the dinner-table and from the family circle for\nthat evening. \"He's coming in, and you've got to go to prison again,\"\nNina said to her, with a kiss.\n\nThe matter to which Mrs. Hittaway's letter more specially alluded\nwas debated between the mother and daughter at great length. They,\nindeed, were less brave and less energetic than was the married\ndaughter of the family; but as they saw Lord Fawn more frequently,\nthey knew better than Mrs. Hittaway the real state of the case. They\nfelt sure that he was already sufficiently embittered against Lady\nEustace, and thought that therefore the peculiarly unpleasant task\nassigned to Lady Fawn need not be performed. Lady Fawn had not the\nadvantage of living so much in the world as her daughter, and was\noppressed by, perhaps, a squeamish delicacy. \"I really could not tell\nhim about her sitting and--and kissing the man. Could I, my dear?\" \"I\ncouldn't,\" said Amelia;--\"but Clara would.\"\n\n\"And to tell the truth,\" continued Lady Fawn, \"I shouldn't care a bit\nabout it if it was not for poor Lucy. What will become of her if that\nman is untrue to her?\"\n\n\"Nothing on earth would make her believe it, unless it came from\nhimself,\" said Amelia,--who really did know something of Lucy's\ncharacter. \"Till he tells her, or till she knows that he's married,\nshe'll never believe it.\"\n\nThen, after a few days, there came those other letters from\nBobsborough,--one from the dean's wife and the other from Frank. The\nmatter there proposed it was necessary that they should discuss with\nLucy, as the suggestion had reached Lucy as well as themselves. She\nat once came to Lady Fawn with her lover's letter, and with a gentle\nmerry laughing face declared that the thing would do very well. \"I am\nsure I should get on with her, and I should know that it wouldn't be\nfor long,\" said Lucy.\n\n\"The truth is, we don't want you to go at all,\" said Lady Fawn.\n\n\"Oh, but I must,\" said Lucy in her sharp, decided tone. \"I must go. I\nwas bound to wait till I heard from Mr. Greystock, because it is my\nfirst duty to obey him. But of course I cannot stay here after what\nhas passed. As Nina says, it is simply going to prison when Lord Fawn\ncomes here.\"\n\n\"Nina is an impertinent little chit,\" said Amelia.\n\n\"She is the dearest little friend in all the world,\" said Lucy, \"and\nalways tells the exact truth. I do go to prison, and when he comes I\nfeel that I ought to go to prison. Of course, I must go away. What\ndoes it matter? Lady Linlithgow won't be exactly like you,\"--and she\nput her little hand upon Lady Fawn's fat arm caressingly, \"and I\nsha'n't have you all to spoil me; but I shall be simply waiting till\nhe comes. Everything now must be no more than waiting till he comes.\"\n\nIf it was to be that \"he\" would never come, this was very dreadful.\nAmelia clearly thought that \"he\" would never come, and Lady Fawn was\napt to think her daughter wiser than herself. And if Mr. Greystock\nwere such as Mrs. Hittaway had described him to be,--if there were to\nbe no such coming as that for which Lucy fondly waited,--then there\nwould be reason ten-fold strong why she should not leave Fawn Court\nand go to Lady Linlithgow. In such case,--when that blow should\nfall,--Lucy would require very different treatment than might be\nexpected for her from the hands of Lady Linlithgow. She would fade\nand fall to the earth like a flower with an insect at its root. She\nwould be like a wounded branch, into which no sap would run. With\nsuch misfortune and wretchedness possibly before her, Lady Fawn could\nnot endure the idea that Lucy should be turned out to encounter it\nall beneath the cold shade of Lady Linlithgow's indifference. \"My\ndear,\" she said, \"let bygones be bygones. Come down and meet Lord\nFawn. Nobody will say anything. After all, you were provoked very\nmuch, and there has been quite enough about it.\"\n\nThis, from Lady Fawn, was almost miraculous,--from Lady Fawn, to whom\nher son had ever been the highest of human beings! But Lucy had told\nthe tale to her lover, and her lover approved of her going. Perhaps\nthere was acting upon her mind some feeling, of which she was hardly\nconscious, that as long as she remained at Fawn Court she would not\nsee her lover. She had told him that she could make herself supremely\nhappy in the simple knowledge that he loved her. But we all know how\nfar such declarations should be taken as true. Of course, she was\nlonging to see him. \"If he would only pass by the road,\" she would\nsay to herself, \"so that I might peep at him through the gate!\" She\nhad no formed idea in her own mind that she would be able to see\nhim should she go to Lady Linlithgow, but still there would be the\nchances of her altered life! She would tell Lady Linlithgow the\ntruth, and why should Lady Linlithgow refuse her so rational a\npleasure? There was, of course, a reason why Frank should not come to\nFawn Court; but the house in Bruton Street need not be closed to him.\n\"I hardly know how to love you enough,\" she said to Lady Fawn, \"but\nindeed I must go. I do so hope the time may come when you and Mr.\nGreystock may be friends. Of course, it will come. Shall it not?\"\n\n\"Who can look into the future?\" said the wise Amelia.\n\n\"Of course, if he is your husband, we shall love him,\" said the less\nwise Lady Fawn.\n\n\"He is to be my husband,\" said Lucy, springing up. \"What do you mean?\nDo you mean anything?\" Lady Fawn, who was not at all wise, protested\nthat she meant nothing.\n\nWhat were they to do? On that special day they merely stipulated\nthat there should be a day's delay before Lady Fawn answered Mrs.\nGreystock's letter,--so that she might sleep upon it. The sleeping on\nit meant that further discussion which was to take place between Lady\nFawn and her second daughter in her ladyship's bed-room that night.\nDuring all this period the general discomfort of Fawn Court was\nincreased by a certain sullenness on the part of Augusta, the elder\ndaughter, who knew that letters had come and that consultations were\nbeing held,--but who was not admitted to those consultations. Since\nthe day on which poor Augusta had been handed over to Lizzie Eustace\nas her peculiar friend in the family, there had always existed a\nfeeling that she, by her position, was debarred from sympathising in\nthe general desire to be quit of Lizzie; and then, too, poor Augusta\nwas never thoroughly trusted by that great guide of the family, Mrs.\nHittaway. \"She couldn't keep it to herself if you'd give her gold to\ndo it,\" Mrs. Hittaway would say. Consequently Augusta was sullen and\nconscious of ill-usage. \"Have you fixed upon anything?\" she said to\nLucy that evening.\n\n\"Not quite;--only I am to go away.\"\n\n\"I don't see why you should go away at all. Frederic doesn't come\nhere so very often, and when he does come he doesn't say much to any\none. I suppose it's all Amelia's doing.\"\n\n\"Nobody wants me to go, only I feel that I ought. Mr. Greystock\nthinks it best.\"\n\n\"I suppose he's going to quarrel with us all.\"\n\n\"No, dear. I don't think he wants to quarrel with any one;--but above\nall he must not quarrel with me. Lord Fawn has quarrelled with him,\nand that's a misfortune,--just for the present.\"\n\n\"And where are you going?\"\n\n\"Nothing has been settled yet; but we are talking of Lady\nLinlithgow,--if she will take me.\"\n\n\"Lady Linlithgow! Oh dear!\"\n\n\"Won't it do?\"\n\n\"They say she is the most dreadful old woman in London. Lady Eustace\ntold such stories about her.\"\n\n\"Do you know, I think I shall rather like it.\"\n\nBut things were very different with Lucy the next morning. That\ndiscussion in Lady Fawn's room was protracted till midnight, and then\nit was decided that just a word should be said to Lucy, so that, if\npossible, she might be induced to remain at Fawn Court. Lady Fawn was\nto say the word, and on the following morning she was closeted with\nLucy. \"My dear,\" she began, \"we all want you to do us a particular\nfavour.\" As she said this, she held Lucy by the hand, and no one\nlooking at them would have thought that Lucy was a governess and that\nLady Fawn was her employer.\n\n\"Dear Lady Fawn, indeed it is better that I should go.\"\n\n\"Stay just one month.\"\n\n\"I couldn't do that, because then this chance of a home would be\ngone. Of course, we can't wait a month before we let Mrs. Greystock\nknow.\"\n\n\"We must write to her, of course.\"\n\n\"And then, you see, Mr. Greystock wishes it.\" Lady Fawn knew that\nLucy could be very firm, and had hardly hoped that anything could\nbe done by simple persuasion. They had long been accustomed among\nthemselves to call her obstinate, and knew that even in her acts of\nobedience she had a way of obeying after her own fashion. It was as\nwell, therefore, that the thing to be said should be said at once.\n\n\"My dear Lucy, has it ever occurred to you that there may be a slip\nbetween the cup and the lip?\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Lady Fawn?\"\n\n\"That sometimes engagements take place which never become more than\nengagements. Look at Lord Fawn and Lady Eustace.\"\n\n\"Mr. Greystock and I are not like that,\" said Lucy, proudly.\n\n\"Such things are very dreadful, Lucy, but they do happen.\"\n\n\"Do you mean anything;--anything real, Lady Fawn?\"\n\n\"I have so strong a reliance on your good sense, that I will tell\nyou just what I do mean. A rumour has reached me that Mr. Greystock\nis--paying more attention than he ought to do to Lady Eustace.\"\n\n\"His own cousin!\"\n\n\"But people marry their cousins, Lucy.\"\n\n\"To whom he has always been just like a brother! I do think that is\nthe cruellest thing. Because he sacrifices his time and his money\nand all his holidays to go and look after her affairs, this is to be\nsaid of him! She hasn't another human being to look after her, and,\ntherefore, he is obliged to do it. Of course he has told me all about\nit. I do think, Lady Fawn,--I do think that is the greatest shame I\never heard!\"\n\n\"But if it should be true--?\"\n\n\"It isn't true.\"\n\n\"But just for the sake of showing you, Lucy--; if it was to be true.\"\n\n\"It won't be true.\"\n\n\"Surely I may speak to you as your friend, Lucy. You needn't be so\nabrupt with me. Will you listen to me, Lucy?\"\n\n\"Of course I will listen;--only nothing that anybody on earth could\nsay about that would make me believe a word of it.\"\n\n\"Very well! Now just let me go on. If it were to be so--\"\n\n\"Oh-h, Lady Fawn!\"\n\n\"Don't be foolish, Lucy. I will say what I've got to say. If--if--\nLet me see. Where was I? I mean just this. You had better remain\nhere till things are a little more settled. Even if it be only a\nrumour,--and I'm sure I don't believe it's anything more,--you had\nbetter hear about it with us,--with friends round you, than with a\nperfect stranger like Lady Linlithgow. If anything were to go wrong\nthere, you wouldn't know where to go for comfort. If anything were\nwrong with you here, you could come to me as though I were your\nmother.--Couldn't you, now?\"\n\n\"Indeed, indeed I could! And I will;--I always will. Lady Fawn, I\nlove you and the dear darling girls better than all the world--except\nMr. Greystock. If anything like that were to happen, I think I should\ncreep here and ask to die in your house. But it won't. And just now\nit will be better that I should go away.\"\n\nIt was found at last that Lucy must have her way, and letters were\nwritten both to Mrs. Greystock and to Frank, requesting that the\nsuggested overtures might at once be made to Lady Linlithgow. Lucy,\nin her letter to her lover, was more than ordinarily cheerful and\njocose. She had a good deal to say about Lady Linlithgow that was\nreally droll, and not a word to say indicative of the slightest fear\nin the direction of Lady Eustace. She spoke of poor Lizzie, and\ndeclared her conviction that that marriage never could come off now.\n\"You mustn't be angry when I say that I can't break my heart for\nthem, for I never did think that they were very much in love. As for\nLord Fawn, of course he is my--ENEMY!\" And she wrote the word in big\nletters. \"And as for Lizzie,--she's your cousin, and all that. And\nshe's ever so pretty, and all that. And she's as rich as Croesus,\nand all that. But I don't think she'll break her own heart. I would\nbreak mine; only--only--only-- You will understand the rest. If it\nshould come to pass, I wonder whether 'the duchess' would ever let a\npoor creature see a friend of hers in Bruton Street?\" Frank had once\ncalled Lady Linlithgow the duchess, after a certain popular picture\nin a certain popular book, and Lucy never forgot anything that Frank\nhad said.\n\nIt did come to pass. Mrs. Greystock at once corresponded with Lady\nLinlithgow, and Lady Linlithgow, who was at Ramsgate for her autumn\nvacation, requested that Lucy Morris might be brought to see her at\nher house in London on the 2nd of October. Lady Linlithgow's autumn\nholiday always ended on the last day of September. On the 2nd of\nOctober Lady Fawn herself took Lucy up to Bruton Street, and Lady\nLinlithgow appeared. \"Miss Morris,\" said Lady Fawn, \"thinks it right\nthat you should be told that she's engaged to be married.\" \"Who\nto?\" demanded the countess. Lucy was as red as fire, although she\nhad especially made up her mind that she would not blush when the\ncommunication was made. \"I don't know that she wishes me to mention\nthe gentleman's name, just at present; but I can assure you that he\nis all that he ought to be.\" \"I hate mysteries,\" said the countess.\n\"If Lady Linlithgow--\" began Lucy. \"Oh, it's nothing to me,\"\ncontinued the old woman. \"It won't come off for six months, I\nsuppose?\" Lucy gave a mute assurance that there would be no such\ndifficulty as that. \"And he can't come here, Miss Morris.\" To this\nLucy said nothing. Perhaps she might win over even the countess, and\nif not, she must bear her six months of prolonged exclusion from the\nlight of day. And so the matter was settled. Lucy was to be taken\nback to Richmond, and to come again on the following Monday. \"I don't\nlike this parting at all, Lucy,\" Lady Fawn said on her way home.\n\n\"It is better so, Lady Fawn.\"\n\n\"I hate people going away; but, somehow, you don't feel it as we do.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't say that if you really knew what I do feel.\"\n\n\"There was no reason why you should go. Frederic was getting not\nto care for it at all. What's Nina to do now? I can't get another\ngoverness after you. I hate all these sudden breaks up. And all for\nsuch a trumpery thing. If Frederic hasn't forgotten all about it, he\nought.\"\n\n\"It hasn't come altogether from him, Lady Fawn.\"\n\n\"How has it come, then?\"\n\n\"I suppose it is because of Mr. Greystock. I suppose when a girl has\nengaged herself to marry a man she must think more of him than of\nanything else.\"\n\n\"Why couldn't you think of him at Fawn Court?\"\n\n\"Because--because things have been unfortunate. He isn't your\nfriend,--not as yet. Can't you understand, Lady Fawn, that, dear as\nyou all must be to me, I must live in his friendships, and take his\npart when there is a part?\"\n\n\"Then I suppose that you mean to hate all of us?\" Lucy could only cry\nat hearing this;--whereupon Lady Fawn also burst into tears.\n\nOn the Sunday before Lucy took her departure, Lord Fawn was again\nat Richmond. \"Of course, you'll come down,--just as if nothing had\nhappened,\" said Lydia. \"We'll see,\" said Lucy. \"Mamma will be very\nangry if you don't,\" said Lydia.\n\nBut Lucy had a little plot in her head, and her appearance at the\ndinner-table on that Sunday must depend on the manner in which her\nplot was executed. After church, Lord Fawn would always hang about\nthe grounds for awhile before going into the house; and on this\nmorning Lucy also remained outside. She soon found her opportunity,\nand walked straight up to him, following him on the path. \"Lord\nFawn,\" she said, \"I have come to beg your pardon.\"\n\nHe had turned round hearing footsteps behind him, but still was\nstartled and unready. \"It does not matter at all,\" he said.\n\n\"It matters to me, because I behaved badly.\"\n\n\"What I said about Mr. Greystock wasn't intended to be said to you,\nyou know.\"\n\n\"Even if it was it would make no matter. I don't mean to think of\nthat now. I beg your pardon because I said what I ought not to have\nsaid.\"\n\n\"You see, Miss Morris, that as the head of this family--\"\n\n\"If I had said it to Juniper, I would have begged his pardon.\" Now\nJuniper was the gardener, and Lord Fawn did not quite like the way in\nwhich the thing was put to him. The cloud came across his brow, and\nhe began to fear that she would again insult him. \"I oughtn't to\naccuse anybody of an untruth,--not in that way; and I am very sorry\nfor what I did, and I beg your pardon.\" Then she turned as though she\nwere going back to the house.\n\nBut he stopped her. \"Miss Morris, if it will suit you to stay with my\nmother, I will never say a word against it.\"\n\n\"It is quite settled that I am to go to-morrow, Lord Fawn. Only for\nthat I would not have troubled you again.\"\n\nThen she did turn towards the house, but he recalled her. \"We will\nshake hands, at any rate,\" he said, \"and not part as enemies.\" So\nthey shook hands, and Lucy came down and sat in his company at the\ndinner-table.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\nLady Linlithgow at Home\n\n\nLucy, in her letter to her lover, had distinctly asked whether she\nmight tell Lady Linlithgow the name of her future husband, but had\nreceived no reply when she was taken to Bruton Street. The parting at\nRichmond was very painful, and Lady Fawn had declared herself quite\nunable to make another journey up to London with the ungrateful\nrunagate. Though there was no diminution of affection among the\nFawns, there was a general feeling that Lucy was behaving badly. That\nobstinacy of hers was getting the better of her. Why should she have\ngone? Even Lord Fawn had expressed his desire that she should remain.\nAnd then, in the breasts of the wise ones, all faith in the Greystock\nengagement had nearly vanished. Another letter had come from Mrs.\nHittaway, who now declared that it was already understood about\nPortray that Lady Eustace intended to marry her cousin. This was\ndescribed as a terrible crime on the part of Lizzie, though the\nantagonistic crime of a remaining desire to marry Lord Fawn was still\nimputed to her. And, of course, the one crime heightened the other.\nSo that words from the eloquent pen of Mrs. Hittaway failed to make\ndark enough the blackness of poor Lizzie's character. As for Mr.\nGreystock, he was simply a heartless man of the world, wishing to\nfeather his nest. Mrs. Hittaway did not for a moment believe that he\nhad ever dreamed of marrying Lucy Morris. Men always have three or\nfour little excitements of that kind going on for the amusement of\ntheir leisure hours,--so, at least, said Mrs. Hittaway. \"The girl had\nbetter be told at once.\" Such was her decision about poor Lucy. \"I\ncan't do more than I have done,\" said Lady Fawn to Augusta. \"She'll\nnever get over it, mamma; never,\" said Augusta.\n\nNothing more was said, and Lucy was sent off in the family carriage.\nLydia and Nina were sent with her, and though there was some weeping\non the journey, there was also much laughing. The character of the\n\"duchess\" was discussed very much at large, and many promises were\nmade as to long letters. Lucy, in truth, was not unhappy. She would\nbe nearer to Frank; and then it had been almost promised her that she\nshould go to the deanery, after a residence of six months with Lady\nLinlithgow. At the deanery of course she would see Frank; and she\nalso understood that a long visit to the deanery would be the surest\nprelude to that home of her own of which she was always dreaming.\n\n\"Dear me;--sent you up in the carriage, has she? Why shouldn't you\nhave come by the railway?\"\n\n\"Lady Fawn thought the carriage best. She is so very kind.\"\n\n\"It's what I call twaddle, you know. I hope you ain't afraid of going\nin a cab.\"\n\n\"Not in the least, Lady Linlithgow.\"\n\n\"You can't have the carriage to go about here. Indeed, I never have a\npair of horses till after Christmas. I hope you know that I'm as poor\nas Job.\"\n\n\"I didn't know.\"\n\n\"I am, then. You'll get nothing beyond wholesome food with me. And\nI'm not sure it is wholesome always. The butchers are scoundrels, and\nthe bakers are worse. What used you to do at Lady Fawn's?\"\n\n\"I still did lessons with the two youngest girls.\"\n\n\"You won't have any lessons to do here, unless you do 'em with me.\nYou had a salary there?\"\n\n\"Oh yes.\"\n\n\"Fifty pounds a year, I suppose.\"\n\n\"I had eighty.\"\n\n\"Had you, indeed; eighty pounds;--and a coach to ride in!\"\n\n\"I had a great deal more than that, Lady Linlithgow.\"\n\n\"How do you mean?\"\n\n\"I had downright love and affection. They were just so many dear\nfriends. I don't suppose any governess was ever so treated before. It\nwas just like being at home. The more I laughed, the better every one\nliked it.\"\n\n\"You won't find anything to laugh at here; at least, I don't. If you\nwant to laugh, you can laugh up-stairs, or down in the parlour.\"\n\n\"I can do without laughing for a while.\"\n\n\"That's lucky, Miss Morris. If they were all so good to you, what\nmade you come away? They sent you away, didn't they?\"\n\n\"Well;--I don't know that I can explain it just all. There were a\ngreat many things together. No;--they didn't send me away. I came\naway because it suited.\"\n\n\"It was something to do with your having a lover, I suppose.\" To this\nLucy thought it best to make no answer, and the conversation for a\nwhile was dropped.\n\nLucy had arrived at about half-past three, and Lady Linlithgow was\nthen sitting in the drawing-room. After the first series of questions\nand answers, Lucy was allowed to go up to her room, and on her return\nto the drawing-room, found the countess still sitting upright in her\nchair. She was now busy with accounts, and at first took no notice of\nLucy's return. What were to be the companion's duties? What tasks in\nthe house were to be assigned to her? What hours were to be her own;\nand what was to be done in those of which the countess would demand\nthe use? Up to the present moment nothing had been said of all\nthis. She had simply been told that she was to be Lady Linlithgow's\ncompanion,--without salary, indeed,--but receiving shelter,\nguardianship, and bread and meat in return for her services. She took\nup a book from the table and sat with it for ten minutes. It was\nTupper's great poem, and she attempted to read it. Lady Linlithgow\nsat, totting up her figures, but said nothing. She had not spoken a\nword since Lucy's return to the room; and as the great poem did not\nat first fascinate the new companion,--whose mind not unnaturally\nwas somewhat disturbed,--Lucy ventured upon a question. \"Is there\nanything I can do for you, Lady Linlithgow?\"\n\n\"Do you know about figures?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. I consider myself quite a ready-reckoner.\"\n\n\"Can you make two and two come to five on one side of the sheet, and\nonly come to three on the other?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I can't do that, and prove it afterwards.\"\n\n\"Then you ain't worth anything to me.\" Having so declared, Lady\nLinlithgow went on with her accounts and Lucy relapsed into her great\npoem.\n\n\"No, my dear,\" said the countess, when she had completed her work.\n\"There isn't anything for you to do. I hope you haven't come here\nwith that mistaken idea. There won't be any sort of work of any kind\nexpected from you. I poke my own fires, and I carve my own bit of\nmutton. And I haven't got a nasty little dog to be washed. And I\ndon't care twopence about worsted work. I have a maid to darn my\nstockings, and because she has to work, I pay her wages. I don't like\nbeing alone, so I get you to come and live with me. I breakfast at\nnine, and if you don't manage to be down by that time, I shall be\ncross.\"\n\n\"I'm always up long before that.\"\n\n\"There's lunch at two,--just bread and butter and cheese, and perhaps\na bit of cold meat. There's dinner at seven;--and very bad it is,\nbecause they don't have any good meat in London. Down in Fifeshire\nthe meat's a deal better than it is here, only I never go there now.\nAt half-past ten I go to bed. It's a pity you're so young, because\nI don't know what you'll do about going out. Perhaps, as you ain't\npretty, it won't signify.\"\n\n\"Not at all, I should think,\" said Lucy.\n\n\"Perhaps you consider yourself pretty. It's all altered now since\nI was young. Girls make monsters of themselves, and I'm told the\nmen like it;--going about with unclean, frowsy structures on their\nheads, enough to make a dog sick. They used to be clean and sweet and\nnice,--what one would like to kiss. How a man can like to kiss a face\nwith a dirty horse's tail all whizzing about it, is what I can't at\nall understand. I don't think they do like it, but they have to do\nit.\"\n\n\"I haven't even a pony's tail,\" said Lucy.\n\n\"They do like to kiss you, I daresay.\"\n\n\"No, they don't,\" ejaculated Lucy, not knowing what answer to make.\n\n\"I haven't hardly looked at you, but you didn't seem to me to be a\nbeauty.\"\n\n\"You're quite right about that, Lady Linlithgow.\"\n\n\"I hate beauties. My niece, Lizzie Eustace, is a beauty; and I think\nthat, of all the heartless creatures in the world, she is the most\nheartless.\"\n\n\"I know Lady Eustace very well.\"\n\n\"Of course you do. She was a Greystock, and you know the Greystocks.\nAnd she was down staying with old Lady Fawn at Richmond. I should\nthink old Lady Fawn had a time with her;--hadn't she?\"\n\n\"It didn't go off very well.\"\n\n\"Lizzie would be too much for the Fawns, I should think. She was too\nmuch for me, I know. She's about as bad as anybody ever was. She's\nfalse, dishonest, heartless, cruel, irreligious, ungrateful, mean,\nignorant, greedy, and vile!\"\n\n\"Good gracious, Lady Linlithgow!\"\n\n\"She's all that, and a great deal worse. But she is handsome. I don't\nknow that I ever saw a prettier woman. I generally go out in a cab\nat three o'clock, but I sha'n't want you to go with me. I don't know\nwhat you can do. Macnulty used to walk round Grosvenor Square and\nthink that people mistook her for a lady of quality. You mustn't go\nand walk round Grosvenor Square by yourself, you know. Not that I\ncare.\"\n\n\"I'm not a bit afraid of anybody,\" said Lucy.\n\n\"Now you know all about it. There isn't anything for you to do. There\nare Miss Edgeworth's novels down-stairs, and 'Pride and Prejudice' in\nmy bed-room. I don't subscribe to Mudie's, because when I asked for\n'Adam Bede,' they always sent me the 'Bandit Chief.' Perhaps you can\nborrow books from your friends at Richmond. I daresay Mrs. Greystock\nhas told you that I'm very cross.\"\n\n\"I haven't seen Mrs. Greystock for ever so long.\"\n\n\"Then Lady Fawn has told you,--or somebody. When the wind is east,\nor north-east, or even north, I am cross, for I have the lumbago.\nIt's all very well talking about being good-humoured. You can't be\ngood-humoured with the lumbago. And I have the gout sometimes in my\nknee. I'm cross enough then, and so you'd be. And, among 'em all, I\ndon't get much above half what I ought to have out of my jointure.\nThat makes me very cross. My teeth are bad, and I like to have the\nmeat tender. But it's always tough, and that makes me cross. And when\npeople go against the grain with me, as Lizzie Eustace always did,\nthen I'm very cross.\"\n\n\"I hope you won't be very bad with me,\" said Lucy.\n\n\"I don't bite, if you mean that,\" said her ladyship.\n\n\"I'd sooner be bitten than barked at,--sometimes,\" said Lucy.\n\n\"Humph!\" said the old woman, and then she went back to her accounts.\n\nLucy had a few books of her own, and she determined to ask Frank to\nsend her some. Books are cheap things, and she would not mind asking\nhim for magazines, and numbers, and perhaps for the loan of a few\nvolumes. In the meantime she did read Tupper's poem, and \"Pride and\nPrejudice,\" and one of Miss Edgeworth's novels,--probably for the\nthird time. During the first week in Bruton Street she would have\nbeen comfortable enough, only that she had not received a line from\nFrank. That Frank was not specially good at writing letters she had\nalready taught herself to understand. She was inclined to believe\nthat but few men of business do write letters willingly, and that, of\nall men, lawyers are the least willing to do so. How reasonable it\nwas that a man who had to perform a great part of his daily work with\na pen in his hand, should loathe a pen when not at work. To her the\nwriting of letters was perhaps the most delightful occupation of her\nlife, and the writing of letters to her lover was a foretaste of\nheaven; but then men, as she knew, are very different from women. And\nshe knew this also,--that of all her immediate duties, no duty could\nbe clearer than that of abstaining from all jealousy, petulance, and\nimpatient expectation of little attentions. He loved her, and had\ntold her so, and had promised her that she should be his wife, and\nthat ought to be enough for her. She was longing for a letter,\nbecause she was very anxious to know whether she might mention his\nname to Lady Linlithgow;--but she would abstain from any idea of\nblaming him because the letter did not come.\n\nOn various occasions the countess showed some little curiosity about\nthe lover; and at last, after about ten days, when she found herself\nbeginning to be intimate with her new companion, she put the question\npoint-blank. \"I hate mysteries,\" she said. \"Who is the young man you\nare to marry?\"\n\n\"He is a gentleman I've known a long time.\"\n\n\"That's no answer.\"\n\n\"I don't want to tell his name quite yet, Lady Linlithgow.\"\n\n\"Why shouldn't you tell his name, unless it's something improper? Is\nhe a gentleman?\"\n\n\"Yes;--he is a gentleman.\"\n\n\"And how old?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know;--perhaps thirty-two.\"\n\n\"And has he any money?\"\n\n\"He has his profession.\"\n\n\"I don't like these kind of secrets, Miss Morris. If you won't say\nwho he is, what was the good of telling me that you were engaged at\nall? How is a person to believe it?\"\n\n\"I don't want you to believe it.\"\n\n\"Highty, tighty!\"\n\n\"I told you my own part of the affair, because I thought you ought\nto know it as I was coming into your house. But I don't see that you\nought to know his part of it. As for not believing, I suppose you\nbelieved Lady Fawn?\"\n\n\"Not a bit better than I believe you. People don't always tell truth\nbecause they have titles, nor yet because they've grown old. He don't\nlive in London;--does he?\"\n\n\"He generally lives in London. He is a barrister.\"\n\n\"Oh,--oh; a barrister is he. They're always making a heap of money,\nor else none at all. Which is it with him?\"\n\n\"He makes something.\"\n\n\"As much as you could put in your eye and see none the worse.\" To\nsee the old lady, as she made this suggestion, turn sharp round upon\nLucy, was as good as a play. \"My sister's nephew, the dean's son, is\none of the best of the rising ones, I'm told.\" Lucy blushed up to\nher hair, but the dowager's back was turned, and she did not see the\nblushes. \"But he's in Parliament, and they tell me he spends his\nmoney faster than he makes it. I suppose you know him?\"\n\n\"Yes;--I knew him at Bobsborough.\"\n\n\"It's my belief that after all this fuss about Lord Fawn, he'll marry\nhis cousin, Lizzie Eustace. If he's a lawyer, and as sharp as they\nsay, I suppose he could manage her. I wish he would.\"\n\n\"And she so bad as you say she is!\"\n\n\"She'll be sure to get somebody, and why shouldn't he have her money\nas well as another? There never was a Greystock who didn't want\nmoney. That's what it will come to;--you'll see.\"\n\n\"Never,\" said Lucy decidedly.\n\n\"And why not?\"\n\n\"What I mean is that Mr. Greystock is,--at least, I should think\nso from what I hear,--the very last man in the world to marry for\nmoney.\"\n\n\"What do you know of what a man would do?\"\n\n\"It would be a very mean thing;--particularly if he does not love\nher.\"\n\n\"Bother!\" said the countess. \"They were very near it in town last\nyear before Lord Fawn came up at all. I knew as much as that. And\nit's what they'll come to before they've done.\"\n\n\"They'll never come to it,\" said Lucy.\n\nThen a sudden light flashed across the astute mind of the countess.\nShe turned round in her chair, and sat for awhile silent, looking at\nLucy. Then she slowly asked another question. \"He isn't your young\nman;--is he?\" To this Lucy made no reply. \"So that's it, is it?\" said\nthe dowager. \"You've done me the honour of making my house your home\ntill my own sister's nephew shall be ready to marry you?\"\n\n\"And why not?\" said Lucy, rather roughly.\n\n\"And dame Greystock, from Bobsborough, has sent you here to keep you\nout of her son's way. I see it all. And that old frump at Richmond\nhas passed you over to me because she did not choose to have such\ngoings on under her own eye.\"\n\n\"There have been no goings on,\" said Lucy.\n\n\"And he's to come here, I suppose, when my back's turned?\"\n\n\"He is not thinking of coming here. I don't know what you mean.\nNobody has done anything wrong to you. I don't know why you say such\ncruel things.\"\n\n\"He can't afford to marry you, you know.\"\n\n\"I don't know anything about it. Perhaps we must wait ever so\nlong;--five years. That's nobody's business but my own.\"\n\n\"I found it all out;--didn't I?\"\n\n\"Yes;--you found it out.\"\n\n\"I'm thinking of that sly old dame Greystock at Bobsborough,--sending\nyou here!\" Neither on that nor on the two following days did Lady\nLinlithgow say a word further to Lucy about her engagement.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV\n\nToo Bad for Sympathy\n\n\nWhen Frank Greystock left Bobsborough to go to Scotland, he had not\nsaid that he would return, nor had he at that time made up his mind\nwhether he would do so or no. He had promised to go and shoot in\nNorfolk, and had half undertaken to be up in London with Herriot,\nworking. Though it was holiday-time, still there was plenty of work\nfor him to do,--various heavy cases to get up, and papers to be read,\nif only he could settle himself down to the doing of it. But the\nscenes down in Scotland had been of a nature to make him unfit for\nsteady labour. How was he to sail his bark through the rocks by which\nhis present voyage was rendered so dangerous? Of course, to the\nreader, the way to do so seems to be clear enough. To work hard at\nhis profession; to explain to his cousin that she had altogether\nmistaken his feelings; and to be true to Lucy Morris was so\nmanifestly his duty, that to no reader will it appear possible that\nto any gentleman there could be a doubt. Instead of the existence\nof a difficulty, there was a flood of light upon his path,--so the\nreader will think;--a flood so clear that not to see his way was\nimpossible. A man carried away by abnormal appetites, and wickedness,\nand the devil, may of course commit murder, or forge bills, or become\na fraudulent director of a bankrupt company. And so may a man be\nuntrue to his troth,--and leave true love in pursuit of tinsel, and\nbeauty, and false words, and a large income. But why should one tell\nthe story of creatures so base? One does not willingly grovel in\ngutters, or breathe fetid atmospheres, or live upon garbage. If we\nare to deal with heroes and heroines, let us, at any rate, have\nheroes and heroines who are above such meanness as falsehood in love.\nThis Frank Greystock must be little better than a mean villain, if he\nallows himself to be turned from his allegiance to Lucy Morris for an\nhour by the seductions and money of such a one as Lizzie Eustace.\n\nWe know the dear old rhyme:--\n\n\n   \"It is good to be merry and wise,\n       It is good to be honest and true,\n    It is good to be off with the old love\n       Before you are on with the new.\"\n\n\nThere was never better truth spoken than this, and if all men and\nwomen could follow the advice here given, there would be very little\nsorrow in the world. But men and women do not follow it. They are no\nmore able to do so than they are to use a spear, the staff of which\nis like a weaver's beam, or to fight with the sword Excalibur. The\nmore they exercise their arms, the nearer will they get to using the\ngiant's weapon,--or even the weapon that is divine. But as things\nare at present, their limbs are limp and their muscles soft, and\nover-feeding impedes their breath. They attempt to be merry without\nbeing wise, and have theories about truth and honesty with which they\ndesire to shackle others, thinking that freedom from such trammels\nmay be good for themselves. And in that matter of love,--though love\nis very potent,--treachery will sometimes seem to be prudence, and a\nhankering after new delights will often interfere with real devotion.\n\nIt is very easy to depict a hero,--a man absolutely stainless,\nperfect as an Arthur,--a man honest in all his dealings, equal to all\ntrials, true in all his speech, indifferent to his own prosperity,\nstruggling for the general good, and, above all, faithful in love.\nAt any rate, it is as easy to do that as to tell of the man who is\none hour good and the next bad, who aspires greatly but fails in\npractice, who sees the higher but too often follows the lower course.\nThere arose at one time a school of art, which delighted to paint\nthe human face as perfect in beauty; and from that time to this we\nare discontented unless every woman is drawn for us as a Venus, or,\nat least, a Madonna. I do not know that we have gained much by this\nuntrue portraiture, either in beauty or in art. There may be made\nfor us a pretty thing to look at, no doubt;--but we know that that\npretty thing is not really visaged as the mistress whom we serve, and\nwhose lineaments we desire to perpetuate on the canvas. The winds of\nheaven, or the flesh-pots of Egypt, or the midnight gas,--passions,\npains, and, perhaps, rouge and powder, have made her something\ndifferent. But there still is the fire of her eye, and the eager\neloquence of her mouth, and something, too, perhaps, left of the\ndeparting innocence of youth, which the painter might give us without\nthe Venus or the Madonna touches. But the painter does not dare to\ndo it. Indeed, he has painted so long after the other fashion that\nhe would hate the canvas before him, were he to give way to the\nrouge-begotten roughness or to the flesh-pots,--or even to the winds.\nAnd how, my lord, would you, who are giving hundreds, more than\nhundreds, for this portrait of your dear one, like to see it in print\nfrom the art critic of the day, that she is a brazen-faced hoyden who\nseems to have had a glass of wine too much, or to have been making\nhay?\n\nAnd so also has the reading world taught itself to like best the\ncharacters of all but divine men and women. Let the man who paints\nwith pen and ink give the gas-light, and the flesh-pots, the passions\nand pains, the prurient prudence and the rouge-pots and pounce-boxes\nof the world as it is, and he will be told that no one can care a\nstraw for his creations. With whom are we to sympathise? says the\nreader, who not unnaturally imagines that a hero should be heroic.\nOh, thou, my reader, whose sympathies are in truth the great and only\naim of my work, when you have called the dearest of your friends\nround you to your hospitable table, how many heroes are there sitting\nat the board? Your bosom friend,--even if he be a knight without\nfear, is he a knight without reproach? The Ivanhoe that you know, did\nhe not press Rebecca's hand? Your Lord Evandale,--did he not bring\nhis coronet into play when he strove to win his Edith Bellenden?\nWas your Tresilian still true and still forbearing when truth and\nforbearance could avail him nothing? And those sweet girls whom you\nknow, do they never doubt between the poor man they think they love,\nand the rich man whose riches they know they covet?\n\nGo into the market, either to buy or sell, and name the thing you\ndesire to part with or to get, as it is, and the market is closed\nagainst you. Middling oats are the sweepings of the granaries. A\nuseful horse is a jade gone at every point. Good sound port is sloe\njuice. No assurance short of A 1 betokens even a pretence to merit.\nAnd yet in real life we are content with oats that are really\nmiddling, are very glad to have a useful horse, and know that if we\ndrink port at all we must drink some that is neither good nor sound.\nIn those delineations of life and character which we call novels a\nsimilarly superlative vein is desired. Our own friends around us are\nnot always merry and wise, nor, alas! always honest and true. They\nare often cross and foolish, and sometimes treacherous and false.\nThey are so, and we are angry. Then we forgive them, not without a\nconsciousness of imperfection on our own part. And we know--or, at\nleast, believe,--that though they be sometimes treacherous and false,\nthere is a balance of good. We cannot have heroes to dine with us.\nThere are none. And were these heroes to be had, we should not like\nthem. But neither are our friends villains,--whose every aspiration\nis for evil, and whose every moment is a struggle for some\nachievement worthy of the devil.\n\nThe persons whom you cannot care for in a novel, because they are so\nbad, are the very same that you so dearly love in your life, because\nthey are so good. To make them and ourselves somewhat better,--not by\none spring heavenwards to perfection, because we cannot so use our\nlegs,--but by slow climbing, is, we may presume, the object of all\nteachers, leaders, legislators, spiritual pastors, and masters. He\nwho writes tales such as this, probably also has, very humbly, some\nsuch object distantly before him. A picture of surpassing godlike\nnobleness,--a picture of a King Arthur among men, may perhaps do\nmuch. But such pictures cannot do all. When such a picture is\npainted, as intending to show what a man should be, it is true. If\npainted to show what men are, it is false. The true picture of life\nas it is, if it could be adequately painted, would show men what they\nare, and how they might rise, not, indeed, to perfection, but one\nstep first, and then another, on the ladder.\n\nOur hero, Frank Greystock, falling lamentably short in his heroism,\nwas not in a happy state of mind when he reached Bobsborough. It\nmay be that he returned to his own borough and to his mother's arms\nbecause he felt, that were he to determine to be false to Lucy, he\nwould there receive sympathy in his treachery. His mother would, at\nany rate, think that it was well, and his father would acknowledge\nthat the fault committed was in the original engagement with poor\nLucy, and not in the treachery. He had written that letter to her in\nhis chambers one night in a fit of ecstasy; and could it be right\nthat the ruin of a whole life should be the consequence?\n\nIt can hardly be too strongly asserted that Lizzie Greystock did not\nappear to Frank as she has been made to appear to the reader. In all\nthis affair of the necklace he was beginning to believe that she\nwas really an ill-used woman; and as to other traits in Lizzie's\ncharacter,--traits which he had seen, and which were not of a nature\nto attract,--it must be remembered that beauty reclining in a man's\narms does go far towards washing white the lovely blackamoor. Lady\nLinlithgow, upon whom Lizzie's beauty could have no effect of that\nkind, had nevertheless declared her to be very beautiful. And this\nloveliness was of a nature that was altogether pleasing, if once the\nbeholder of it could get over the idea of falseness which certainly\nLizzie's eye was apt to convey to the beholder. There was no unclean\nhorse's tail. There was no get-up of flounces, and padding, and\npaint, and hair, with a dorsal excrescence appended with the object\nsurely of showing in triumph how much absurd ugliness women can force\nmen to endure. She was lithe, and active, and bright,--and was at\nthis moment of her life at her best. Her growing charms had as yet\nhardly reached the limits of full feminine loveliness,--which, when\nreached, have been surpassed. Luxuriant beauty had with her not as\nyet become comeliness; nor had age or the good things of the world\nadded a pound to the fairy lightness of her footstep. All this had\nbeen tendered to Frank,--and with it that worldly wealth which was\nso absolutely necessary to his career. For though Greystock would\nnot have said to any man or woman that nature had intended him to\nbe a spender of much money and a consumer of many good things, he\ndid undoubtedly so think of himself. He was a Greystock, and to\nwhat miseries would he not reduce his Lucy if, burthened by such\npropensities, he were to marry her and then become an aristocratic\npauper!\n\nThe offer of herself by a woman to a man is, to us all, a thing\nso distasteful that we at once declare that the woman must be\nabominable. There shall be no whitewashing of Lizzie Eustace. She\nwas abominable. But the man to whom the offer is made hardly sees\nthe thing in the same light. He is disposed to believe that, in his\npeculiar case, there are circumstances by which the woman is, if not\njustified, at least excused. Frank did put faith in his cousin's\nlove for himself. He did credit her when she told him that she had\naccepted Lord Fawn's offer in pique, because he had not come to her\nwhen he had promised that he would come. It did seem natural to him\nthat she should have desired to adhere to her engagement when he\nwould not advise her to depart from it. And then her jealousy about\nLucy's ring, and her abuse of Lucy, were proofs to him of her love.\nUnless she loved him, why should she care to marry him? What was his\nposition that she should desire to share it;--unless she so desired\nbecause he was dearer to her than aught beside? He had not eyes\nclear enough to perceive that his cousin was a witch whistling for a\nwind, and ready to take the first blast that would carry her and her\nbroomstick somewhere into the sky. And then, in that matter of the\noffer, which in ordinary circumstances certainly should not have\ncome from her to him, did not the fact of her wealth and of his\ncomparative poverty cleanse her from such stain as would, in usual\ncircumstances, attach to a woman who is so forward? He had not\nacceded to her proposition. He had not denied his engagement to Lucy.\nHe had left her presence without a word of encouragement, because\nof that engagement. But he believed that Lizzie was sincere. He\nbelieved, now, that she was genuine; though he had previously been\nall but sure that falsehood and artifice were second nature to her.\n\nAt Bobsborough he met his constituents, and made them the normal\nautumn speech. The men of Bobsborough were well pleased and gave him\na vote of confidence. As none but those of his own party attended\nthe meeting, it was not wonderful that the vote was unanimous. His\nfather, mother, and sister all heard his speech, and there was a\nstrong family feeling that Frank was born to set the Greystocks once\nmore upon their legs. When a man can say what he likes with the\ncertainty that every word will be reported, and can speak to those\naround him as one manifestly their superior, he always looms large.\nWhen the Conservatives should return to their proper place at the\nhead of affairs, there could be no doubt that Frank Greystock would\nbe made Solicitor-General. There were not wanting even ardent\nadmirers who conceived that, with such claims and such talents as\nhis, the ordinary steps in political promotion would not be needed,\nand that he would become Attorney-General at once. All men began to\nsay all good things to the dean, and to Mrs. Greystock it seemed\nthat the woolsack, or at least the Queen's Bench with a peerage, was\nhardly an uncertainty. But then,--there must be no marriage with a\npenniless governess. If he would only marry his cousin one might say\nthat the woolsack was won.\n\nThen came Lucy's letter; the pretty, dear, joking letter about\nthe \"duchess,\" and broken hearts. \"I would break my heart,\nonly--only--only--\" Yes, he knew very well what she meant. I shall\nnever be called upon to break my heart, because you are not a false\nscoundrel. If you were a false scoundrel,--instead of being, as you\nare, a pearl among men,--then I should break my heart. That was what\nLucy meant. She could not have been much clearer, and he understood\nit perfectly. It is very nice to walk about one's own borough and be\nvoted unanimously worthy of confidence, and be a great man; but if\nyou are a scoundrel, and not used to being a scoundrel, black care\nis apt to sit very close behind you as you go caracoling along the\nstreets.\n\nLucy's letter required an answer, and how should he answer it? He\ncertainly did not wish her to tell Lady Linlithgow of her engagement,\nbut Lucy clearly wished to be allowed to tell, and on what ground\ncould he enjoin her to be silent? He knew, or he thought he knew,\nthat till he answered the letter, she would not tell his secret,--and\ntherefore from day to day he put off the answer. A man does not write\na love-letter easily when he is in doubt himself whether he does or\ndoes not mean to be a scoundrel.\n\nThen there came a letter to \"Dame\" Greystock from Lady Linlithgow,\nwhich filled them all with amazement.\n\n\n   MY DEAR MADAM,--[began the letter]\n\n   Seeing that your son is engaged to marry Miss Morris,--at\n   least she says so,--you ought not to have sent her here\n   without telling me all about it. She says you know of the\n   match, and she says that I can write to you if I please.\n   Of course, I can do that without her leave. But it seems\n   to me that if you know all about it, and approve the\n   marriage, your house and not mine would be the proper\n   place for her.\n\n   I'm told that Mr. Greystock is a great man. Any lady\n   being with me as my companion can't be a great woman. But\n   perhaps you wanted to break it off;--else you would have\n   told me. She shall stay here six months, but then she must\n   go.\n\n   Yours truly,\n\n   SUSANNA LINLITHGOW.\n\n\nIt was considered absolutely necessary that this letter should be\nshown to Frank. \"You see,\" said his mother, \"she told the old lady at\nonce.\"\n\n\"I don't see why she shouldn't.\" Nevertheless Frank was annoyed.\nHaving asked for permission, Lucy should at least have waited for a\nreply.\n\n\"Well, I don't know,\" said Mrs. Greystock. \"It is generally\nconsidered that young ladies are more reticent about such things. She\nhas blurted it out and boasted about it at once.\"\n\n\"I thought girls always told of their engagements,\" said Frank, \"and\nI can't for the life of me see that there was any boasting in it.\"\nThen he was silent for a moment. \"The truth is, we are, all of us,\ntreating Lucy very badly.\"\n\n\"I cannot say that I see it,\" said his mother.\n\n\"We ought to have had her here.\"\n\n\"For how long, Frank?\"\n\n\"For as long as a home was needed by her.\"\n\n\"Had you demanded it, Frank, she should have come, of course. But\nneither I nor your father could have had pleasure in receiving her as\nyour future wife. You, yourself, say that it cannot be for two years\nat least.\"\n\n\"I said one year.\"\n\n\"I think, Frank, you said two. And we all know that such a marriage\nwould be ruinous to you. How could we make her welcome? Can you see\nyour way to having a house for her to live in within twelve months?\"\n\n\"Why not a house? I could have a house to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Such a house as would suit you in your position? And, Frank, would\nit be a kindness to marry her and then let her find that you were in\ndebt?\"\n\n\"I don't believe she'd care if she had nothing but a crust to eat.\"\n\n\"She ought to care, Frank.\"\n\n\"I think,\" said the dean to his son, on the next day, \"that in our\nclass of life an imprudent marriage is the one thing that should be\navoided. My marriage has been very happy, God knows; but I have\nalways been a poor man, and feel it now when I am quite unable\nto help you. And yet your mother had some fortune. Nobody, I\nthink, cares less for wealth than I do. I am content almost with\nnothing.\"--The nothing with which the dean had hitherto been\ncontented had always included every comfort of life, a well-kept\ntable, good wine, new books, and canonical habiliments with the gloss\nstill on; but as the Bobsborough tradesmen had, through the agency of\nMrs. Greystock, always supplied him with these things as though they\ncame from the clouds, he really did believe that he had never asked\nfor anything.--\"I am content almost with nothing. But I do feel that\nmarriage cannot be adopted as the ordinary form of life by men in our\nclass as it can be by the rich or by the poor. You, for instance, are\ncalled upon to live with the rich, but are not rich. That can only\nbe done by wary walking, and is hardly consistent with a wife and\nchildren.\"\n\n\"But men in my position do marry, sir.\"\n\n\"After a certain age,--or else they marry ladies with money. You see,\nFrank, there are not many men who go into Parliament with means so\nmoderate as yours; and they who do perhaps have stricter ideas of\neconomy.\" The dean did not say a word about Lucy Morris, and dealt\nentirely with generalities.\n\nIn compliance with her son's advice,--or almost command,--Mrs.\nGreystock did not answer Lady Linlithgow's letter. He was going back\nto London, and would give personally, or by letter written there,\nwhat answer might be necessary. \"You will then see Miss Morris?\"\nasked his mother.\n\n\"I shall certainly see Lucy. Something must be settled.\" There was\na tone in his voice as he said this which gave some comfort to his\nmother.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI\n\nLizzie's Guests\n\n\nTrue to their words, at the end of October, Mrs. Carbuncle and Miss\nRoanoke, and Lord George de Bruce Carruthers, and Sir Griffin Tewett,\narrived at Portray Castle. And for a couple of days there was a\nvisitor whom Lizzie was very glad to welcome, but of whose good\nnature on the occasion Mr. Camperdown thought very ill indeed. This\nwas John Eustace. His sister-in-law wrote to him in very pressing\nlanguage; and as,--so he said to Mr. Camperdown,--he did not wish\nto seem to quarrel with his brother's widow as long as such seeming\nmight be avoided, he accepted the invitation. If there was to be a\nlawsuit about the diamonds, that must be Mr. Camperdown's affair.\nLizzie had never entertained her friends in style before. She had\nhad a few people to dine with her in London, and once or twice\nhad received company on an evening. But in all her London doings\nthere had been the trepidation of fear,--to be accounted for by\nher youth and widowhood; and it was at Portray,--her own house at\nPortray,--that it would best become her to exercise hospitality. She\nhad bided her time even there, but now she meant to show her friends\nthat she had got a house of her own.\n\nShe wrote even to her husband's uncle, the bishop, asking him down\nto Portray. He could not come, but sent an affectionate answer, and\nthanked her for thinking of him. Many people she asked who, she\nfelt sure, would not come,--and one or two of them accepted her\ninvitation. John Eustace promised to be with her for two days. When\nFrank had left her, going out of her presence in the manner that has\nbeen described, she actually wrote to him, begging him to join her\nparty. This was her note:\n\n\"Come to me, just for a week,\" she said, \"when my people are here, so\nthat I may not seem to be deserted. Sit at the bottom of my table,\nand be to me as a brother might. I shall expect you to do so much for\nme.\" To this he had replied that he would come during the first week\nin November.\n\nAnd she got a clergyman down from London, the Rev. Joseph Emilius,\nof whom it was said that he was born a Jew in Hungary, and that his\nname in his own country had been Mealyus. At the present time he was\namong the most eloquent of London preachers, and was reputed by some\nto have reached such a standard of pulpit-oratory as to have had no\nequal within the memory of living hearers. In regard to his reading\nit was acknowledged that no one since Mrs. Siddons had touched him.\nBut he did not get on very well with any particular bishop, and there\nwas doubt in the minds of some people whether there was or was not\nany--Mrs. Emilius. He had come up quite suddenly within the last\nseason, and had made church-going quite a pleasant occupation to\nLizzie Eustace.\n\nOn the last day of October, Mr. Emilius and Mr. John Eustace\ncame, each alone. Mrs. Carbuncle and Miss Roanoke came over with\npost-horses from Ayr,--as also did Lord George and Sir Griffin about\nan hour after them. Frank was not yet expected. He had promised to\nname a day and had not yet named it.\n\n\"Varra weel; varra weel,\" Gowran had said when he was told of what\nwas about to occur, and was desired to make preparations necessary in\nregard to the outside plenishing of the house; \"nae doobt she'll do\nwith her ain what pleases her ainself. The mair ye poor out, the less\nthere'll be left in. Mr. Jo-ohn coming? I'll be glad then to see Mr.\nJo-ohn. Oo, ay; aits,--there'll be aits eneuch. And anither coo?\nYou'll want twa ither coos. I'll see to the coos.\" And Andy Gowran,\nin spite of the internecine warfare which existed between him and his\nmistress, did see to the hay, and the cows, and the oats, and the\nextra servants that were wanted both inside and outside the house.\nThere was enmity between him and Lady Eustace, and he didn't care who\nknew it;--but he took her wages and he did her work.\n\nMrs. Carbuncle was a wonderful woman. She was the wife of a man with\nwhom she was very rarely seen, whom nobody knew, who was something\nin the City, but somebody who never succeeded in making money; and\nyet she went everywhere. She had at least the reputation of going\neverywhere, and did go to a great many places. Carbuncle had no\nmoney,--so it was said; and she had none. She was the daughter of\na man who had gone to New York and had failed there. Of her own\nparentage no more was known. She had a small house in one of the very\nsmall Mayfair streets, to which she was wont to invite her friends\nfor five o'clock tea. Other receptions she never attempted. During\nthe London seasons she always kept a carriage, and during the winters\nshe always had hunters. Who paid for them no one knew or cared. Her\ndress was always perfect,--as far as fit and performance went. As\nto approving Mrs. Carbuncle's manner of dress,--that was a question\nof taste. Audacity may, perhaps, be said to have been the ruling\nprinciple of her toilet;--not the audacity of indecency, which, let\nthe satirists say what they may, is not efficacious in England, but\naudacity in colour, audacity in design, and audacity in construction.\nShe would ride in the park in a black and yellow habit, and appear at\nthe opera in white velvet without a speck of colour. Though certainly\nturned thirty, and probably nearer to forty, she would wear her\njet-black hair streaming down her back, and when June came would\ndrive about London in a straw hat. But yet it was always admitted\nthat she was well dressed. And then would arise that question, who\npaid the bills?\n\nMrs. Carbuncle was certainly a handsome woman. She was\nfull-faced,--with bold eyes, rather far apart, perfect black\neyebrows, a well-formed broad nose, thick lips, and regular teeth.\nHer chin was round and short, with, perhaps, a little bearing towards\na double chin. But though her face was plump and round, there was\na power in it, and a look of command, of which it was, perhaps,\ndifficult to say in what features was the seat. But in truth the\nmind will lend a tone to every feature, and it was the desire of Mrs.\nCarbuncle's heart to command. But perhaps the wonder of her face was\nits complexion. People said,--before they knew her, that, as a matter\nof course, she had been made beautiful for ever. But, though that too\nbrilliant colour was almost always there, covering the cheeks but\nnever touching the forehead or the neck, it would at certain moments\nshift, change, and even depart. When she was angry, it would vanish\nfor a moment and then return intensified. There was no chemistry on\nMrs. Carbuncle's cheek; and yet it was a tint so brilliant and so\nlittle transparent, as almost to justify a conviction that it could\nnot be genuine. There were those who declared that nothing in the way\nof complexion so beautiful as that of Mrs. Carbuncle's had been seen\non the face of any other woman in this age, and there were others\nwho called her an exaggerated milkmaid. She was tall, too, and had\nlearned so to walk as though half the world belonged to her.\n\nHer niece, Miss Roanoke, was a lady of the same stamp, and of similar\nbeauty, with those additions and also with those drawbacks which\nbelong to youth. She looked as though she were four-and-twenty, but\nin truth she was no more than eighteen. When seen beside her aunt,\nshe seemed to be no more than half the elder lady's size; and yet her\nproportions were not insignificant. She, too, was tall, and was as\none used to command, and walked as though she were a young Juno. Her\nhair was very dark,--almost black,--and very plentiful. Her eyes were\nlarge and bright, though too bold for a girl so young. Her nose and\nmouth were exactly as her aunt's, but her chin was somewhat longer,\nso as to divest her face of that plump roundness which, perhaps,\ntook something from the majesty of Mrs. Carbuncle's appearance. Miss\nRoanoke's complexion was certainly marvellous. No one thought that\nshe had been made beautiful for ever, for the colour would go and\ncome and shift and change with every word and every thought;--but\nstill it was there, as deep on her cheeks as on her aunt's, though\nsomewhat more transparent, and with more delicacy of tint as the\nbright hues faded away and became merged in the almost marble\nwhiteness of her skin. With Mrs. Carbuncle there was no merging and\nfading. The red and white bordered one another on her cheek without\nany merging, as they do on a flag.\n\nLucinda Roanoke was undoubtedly a very handsome woman. It probably\nnever occurred to man or woman to say that she was lovely. She had\nsat for her portrait during the last winter, and her picture had\ncaused much remark in the Exhibition. Some said that she might be a\nBrinvilliers, others a Cleopatra, and others again a Queen of Sheba.\nIn her eyes as they were limned there had been nothing certainly of\nlove, but they who likened her to the Egyptian queen believed that\nCleopatra's love had always been used simply to assist her ambition.\nThey who took the Brinvilliers side of the controversy were men so\nused to softness and flattery from women as to have learned to think\nthat a woman silent, arrogant, and hard of approach, must be always\nmeditating murder. The disciples of the Queen of Sheba school, who\nformed, perhaps, the more numerous party, were led to their opinion\nby the majesty of Lucinda's demeanour rather than by any clear idea\nin their own minds of the lady who visited Solomon. All men, however,\nagreed in this, that Lucinda Roanoke was very handsome, but that she\nwas not the sort of girl with whom a man would wish to stray away\nthrough the distant beech-trees at a picnic.\n\nIn truth she was silent, grave, and, if not really haughty, subject\nto all the signs of haughtiness. She went everywhere with her aunt,\nand allowed herself to be walked out at dances, and to be accosted\nwhen on horseback, and to be spoken to at parties; but she seemed\nhardly to trouble herself to talk;--and as for laughing, flirting, or\ngiggling, one might as well expect such levity from a marble Minerva.\nDuring the last winter she had taken to hunting with her aunt, and\nalready could ride well to hounds. If assistance were wanted at a\ngate, or in the management of a fence, and the servant who attended\nthe two ladies were not near enough to give it, she would accept it\nas her due from the man nearest to her; but she rarely did more than\nbow her thanks, and, even by young lords, or hard-riding handsome\ncolonels, or squires of undoubted thousands, she could hardly ever be\nbrought to what might be called a proper hunting-field conversation.\nAll of which things were noted, and spoken of, and admired. It must\nbe presumed that Lucinda Roanoke was in want of a husband, and yet\nno girl seemed to take less pains to get one. A girl ought not to be\nalways busying herself to bring down a man, but a girl ought to give\nherself some charm. A girl so handsome as Lucinda Roanoke, with pluck\nenough to ride like a bird, dignity enough for a duchess, and who was\nundoubtedly clever, ought to put herself in the way of taking such\ngood things as her charms and merits would bring her;--but Lucinda\nRoanoke stood aloof and despised everybody. So it was that Lucinda\nwas spoken of when her name was mentioned; and her name was mentioned\na good deal after the opening of the exhibition of pictures.\n\nThere was some difficulty about her,--as to who she was. That she was\nan American was the received opinion. Her mother, as well as Mrs.\nCarbuncle, had certainly been in New York. Carbuncle was a London\nman; but it was supposed that Mr. Roanoke was, or had been, an\nAmerican. The received opinion was correct. Lucinda had been born\nin New York, had been educated there till she was sixteen, had then\nbeen taken to Paris for nine months, and from Paris had been brought\nto London by her aunt. Mrs. Carbuncle always spoke of Lucinda's\neducation as having been thoroughly Parisian. Of her own education\nand antecedents, Lucinda never spoke at all. \"I'll tell you what\nit is,\" said a young scamp from Eton to his elder sister, when her\ncharacter and position were once being discussed. \"She's a heroine,\nand would shoot a fellow as soon as look at him.\" In that scamp's\nfamily, Lucinda was ever afterwards called the heroine.\n\nThe manner in which Lord George de Bruce Carruthers had attached\nhimself to these ladies was a mystery;--but then Lord George was\nalways mysterious. He was a young man,--so considered,--about\nforty-five years of age, who had never done anything in the manner of\nother people. He hunted a great deal, but he did not fraternise with\nhunting men, and would appear now in this county and now in that,\nwith an utter disregard of grass, fences, friendships, or foxes.\nLeicester, Essex, Ayrshire, or the Baron had equal delights for\nhim; and in all counties he was quite at home. He had never owned a\nfortune, and had never been known to earn a shilling. It was said\nthat early in life he had been apprenticed to an attorney at Aberdeen\nas George Carruthers. His third cousin, the Marquis of Killiecrankie,\nhad been killed out hunting; the second scion of the noble family had\nfallen at Balaclava; a third had perished in the Indian Mutiny; and\na fourth, who did reign for a few months, died suddenly, leaving\na large family of daughters. Within three years the four brothers\nvanished, leaving among them no male heir, and George's elder\nbrother, who was then in a West India Regiment, was called home from\nDemerara to be Marquis of Killiecrankie. By a usual exercise of the\ncourtesy of the Crown, all the brothers were made lords, and some\ntwelve years before the date of our story George Carruthers, who had\nlong since left the attorney's office at Aberdeen, became Lord George\nde Bruce Carruthers. How he lived no one knew. That his brother did\nmuch for him was presumed to be impossible, as the property entailed\non the Killiecrankie title certainly was not large. He sometimes\nwent into the City, and was supposed to know something about shares.\nPerhaps he played a little, and made a few bets. He generally lived\nwith men of means;--or perhaps with one man of means at a time; but\nthey who knew him well declared that he never borrowed a shilling\nfrom a friend, and never owed a guinea to a tradesman. He always had\nhorses, but never had a home. When in London he lodged in a single\nroom, and dined at his club. He was a Colonel of Volunteers, having\ngot up the regiment known as the Long Shore Riflemen,--the roughest\nregiment of Volunteers in all England,--and was reputed to be a\nbitter Radical. He was suspected even of republican sentiments, and\nignorant young men about London hinted that he was the grand centre\nof the British Fenians. He had been invited to stand for the Tower\nHamlets, but had told the deputation which waited upon him that he\nknew a thing worth two of that. Would they guarantee his expenses,\nand then give him a salary? The deputation doubted its ability to\npromise so much. \"I more than doubt it,\" said Lord George; and then\nthe deputation went away.\n\nIn person he was a long-legged, long-bodied, long-faced man, with\nrough whiskers and a rough beard on his upper lip, but with a shorn\nchin. His eyes were very deep set in his head, and his cheeks were\nhollow and sallow, and yet he looked to be and was a powerful,\nhealthy man. He had large hands, which seemed to be all bone, and\nlong arms, and a neck which looked to be long because he so wore his\nshirt that much of his throat was always bare. It was manifest enough\nthat he liked to have good-looking women about him, and yet nobody\npresumed it probable that he would marry. For the last two or three\nyears there had been friendship between him and Mrs. Carbuncle; and\nduring the last season he had become almost intimate with our Lizzie.\nLizzie thought that perhaps he might be the Corsair whom, sooner or\nlater in her life, she must certainly encounter.\n\nSir Griffin Tewett, who at the present period of his existence was\nbeing led about by Lord George, was not exactly an amiable young\nbaronet. Nor were his circumstances such as make a man amiable. He\nwas nominally, not only the heir to, but actually the possessor of,\na large property;--but he could not touch the principal, and of the\nincome only so much as certain legal curmudgeons would allow him. As\nGreystock had said, everybody was at law with him,--so successful\nhad been his father in mismanaging, and miscontrolling, and\nmisappropriating the property. Tewett Hall had gone to rack and ruin\nfor four years, and was now let almost for nothing. He was a fair,\nfrail young man, with a bad eye, and a weak mouth, and a thin hand,\nwho was fond of liqueurs, and hated to the death any acquaintance who\nwon a five-pound note of him, or any tradesman who wished to have\nhis bill paid. But he had this redeeming quality,--that having found\nLucinda Roanoke to be the handsomest woman he had ever seen, he did\ndesire to make her his wife.\n\nSuch were the friends whom Lizzie Eustace received at Portray Castle\non the first day of her grand hospitality,--together with John\nEustace and Mr. Joseph Emilius, the fashionable preacher from\nMayfair.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII\n\nLizzie's First Day\n\n\nThe coming of John Eustace was certainly a great thing for Lizzie,\nthough it was only for two days. It saved her from that feeling of\ndesertion before her friends,--desertion by those who might naturally\nbelong to her,--which would otherwise have afflicted her. His\npresence there for two days gave her a start. She could call him\nJohn, and bring down her boy to him, and remind him, with the\nsweetest smile,--with almost a tear in her eye,--that he was the\nboy's guardian. \"Little fellow! So much depends on that little\nlife,--does it not, John?\" she said, whispering the words into his\near.\n\n\"Lucky little dog!\" said John, patting the boy's head. \"Let me see!\nof course he'll go to Eton.\"\n\n\"Not yet,\" said Lizzie with a shudder.\n\n\"Well; no; hardly;--when he's twelve.\" And then the boy was done with\nand was carried away. She had played that card and had turned her\ntrick. John Eustace was a thoroughly good-natured man of the world,\nwho could forgive many faults, not expecting people to be perfect.\nHe did not like Mrs. Carbuncle;--was indifferent to Lucinda's\nbeauty;--was afraid of that Tartar, Lord George;--and thoroughly\ndespised Sir Griffin. In his heart he believed Mr. Emilius to be an\nimpostor, who might, for aught he knew, pick his pocket; and Miss\nMacnulty had no attraction for him. But he smiled, and was gay, and\ncalled Lady Eustace by her Christian name, and was content to be of\nuse to her in showing her friends that she had not been altogether\ndropped by the Eustace people. \"I got such a nice affectionate letter\nfrom the dear bishop,\" said Lizzie, \"but he couldn't come. He could\nnot escape a previous engagement.\"\n\n\"It's a long way,\" said John, \"and he's not so young as he was\nonce;--and then there are the Bobsborough parsons to look after.\"\n\n\"I don't suppose anything of that kind stops him,\" said Lizzie, who\ndid not think it possible that a bishop's bliss should be alloyed\nby work. John was so very nice that she almost made up her mind to\ntalk to him about the necklace; but she was cautious, and thought of\nit, and found that it would be better that she should abstain. John\nEustace was certainly very good-natured, but perhaps he might say\nan ugly word to her if she were rash. She refrained, therefore, and\nafter breakfast on the second day he took his departure without an\nallusion to things that were unpleasant.\n\n\"I call my brother-in-law a perfect gentleman,\" said Lizzie with\nenthusiasm, when his back was turned.\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle. \"He seems to me to be very quiet.\"\n\n\"He didn't quite like his party,\" said Lord George.\n\n\"I am sure he did,\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"I mean as to politics. To him we are all turbulent demagogues\nand Bohemians. Eustace is an old-world Tory, if there's one left\nanywhere. But you're right, Lady Eustace; he is a gentleman.\"\n\n\"He knows on which side his bread is buttered as well as any man,\"\nsaid Sir Griffin.\n\n\"Am I a demagogue,\" said Lizzie, appealing to the Corsair, \"or a\nBohemian? I didn't know it.\"\n\n\"A little in that way, I think, Lady Eustace;--not a demagogue, but\ndemagognical;--not a Bohemian, but that way given.\"\n\n\"And is Miss Roanoke demagognical?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Lord George. \"I hardly wrong you there, Miss\nRoanoke?\"\n\n\"Lucinda is a democrat, but hardly a demagogue, Lord George,\" said\nMrs. Carbuncle.\n\n\"Those are distinctions which we hardly understand on this\nthick-headed side of the water. But demagogues, democrats,\ndemonstrations, and Demosthenic oratory are all equally odious to\nJohn Eustace. For a young man he's about the best Tory I know.\"\n\n\"He is true to his colours,\" said Mr. Emilius, who had been\nendeavouring to awake the attention of Miss Roanoke on the subject of\nShakespeare's dramatic action, \"and I like men who are true to their\ncolours.\" Mr. Emilius spoke with the slightest possible tone of a\nforeign accent,--a tone so slight that it simply served to attract\nattention to him.\n\nWhile Eustace was still in the house, there had come a letter from\nFrank Greystock, saying that he would reach Portray, by way of\nGlasgow, on Wednesday, the 5th of November. He must sleep in Glasgow\non that night, having business, or friends, or pleasure demanding his\nattention in that prosperous mart of commerce. It had been impressed\nupon him that he should hunt, and he had consented. There was to be\na meet out on the Kilmarnock side of the county on that Wednesday,\nand he would bring a horse with him from Glasgow. Even in Glasgow a\nhunter was to be hired, and could be sent forty or fifty miles out\nof the town in the morning and brought back in the evening. Lizzie\nhad learned all about that, and had told him. If he would call\nat MacFarlane's stables in Buchanan Street, or even write to Mr.\nMacFarlane, he would be sure to get a horse that would carry him.\nMacFarlane was sending horses down into the Ayrshire country every\nday of his life. It was simply an affair of money. Three guineas for\nthe horse, and then just the expense of the railway. Frank, who knew\nquite as much about it as did his cousin, and who never thought much\nof guineas or of railway tickets, promised to meet the party at the\nmeet ready equipped. His things would go on by train, and Lizzie must\nsend for them to Troon. He presumed a beneficent Providence would\ntake the horse back to the bosom of Mr. MacFarlane. Such was the\ntenour of his letter. \"If he don't mind, he'll find himself astray,\"\nsaid Sir Griffin. \"He'll have to go one way by rail and his horse\nanother.\" \"We can manage better for our cousin than that,\" said\nLizzie, with a rebuking nod.\n\nBut there was hunting from Portray before Frank Greystock came. It\nwas specially a hunting party, and Lizzie was to be introduced to the\nglories of the field. In giving her her due, it must be acknowledged\nthat she was fit for the work. She rode well, though she had not\nridden to hounds, and her courage was cool. She looked well on\nhorseback, and had that presence of mind which should never desert a\nlady when she is hunting. A couple of horses had been purchased for\nher, under Lord George's superintendence,--his conjointly with\nMrs. Carbuncle's,--and had been at the castle for the last ten\ndays--\"eating their varra heeds off,\" as Andy Gowran had said in\nsorrow. There had been practising even while John Eustace was there,\nand before her preceptors had slept three nights at the castle, she\nhad ridden backwards and forwards half-a-dozen times over a stone\nwall. \"Oh, yes,\" Lucinda had said, in answer to a remark from\nSir Griffin, \"It's easy enough,--till you come across something\ndifficult.\"\n\n\"Nothing difficult stops you,\" said Sir Griffin;--to which compliment\nLucinda vouchsafed no reply.\n\nOn the Monday Lizzie went out hunting for the first time in her\nlife. It must be owned that, as she put her habit on, and afterwards\nbreakfasted with all her guests in hunting gear around her, and then\nwas driven with them in her own carriage to the meet, there was\nsomething of trepidation at her heart. And her feeling of cautious\nfear in regard to money had received a shock. Mrs. Carbuncle had told\nher that a couple of horses fit to carry her might perhaps cost her\nabout \u00c2\u00a3180. Lord George had received the commission, and the cheque\nrequired from her had been for \u00c2\u00a3320. Of course she had written the\ncheque without a word, but it did begin to occur to her that hunting\nwas an expensive amusement. Gowran had informed her that he had\nbought a rick of hay from a neighbour for \u00c2\u00a375 15s. 9d. \"God forgie\nme,\" said Andy, \"but I b'lieve I've been o'er hard on the puir man\nin your leddyship's service.\" \u00c2\u00a375 15s. 9d. did seem a great deal of\nmoney to pay; and could it be necessary that she should buy a whole\nrick? There were to be eight horses in the stable. To what friend\ncould she apply to learn how much of a rick of hay one horse ought to\neat in a month of hunting? In such a matter she might have trusted\nAndy Gowran implicitly; but how was she to know that? And then, what\nif at some desperate fence she were to be thrown off and break her\nnose and knock out her front teeth! Was the game worth the candle?\nShe was by no means sure that she liked Mrs. Carbuncle very much. And\nthough she liked Lord George very well, could it be possible that he\nbought the horses for \u00c2\u00a390 each and charged her \u00c2\u00a3160? Corsairs do do\nthese sort of things. The horses themselves were two sweet dears,\nwith stars on their foreheads, and shining coats, and a delicious\naptitude for jumping over everything at a moment's notice. Lord\nGeorge had not, in truth, made a penny by them, and they were good\nhunters, worth the money;--but how was Lizzie to know that? But\nthough she doubted, and was full of fears, she could smile and look\nas though she liked it. If the worst should come she could certainly\nget money for the diamonds.\n\nOn that Monday the meet was comparatively near to them,--distant only\ntwelve miles. On the following Wednesday it would be sixteen, and\nthey would use the railway,--having the carriage sent to meet them\nin the evening. The three ladies and Lord George filled the carriage,\nand Sir Griffin was perched upon the box. The ladies' horses had gone\non with two grooms, and those for Lord George and Sir Griffin were\nto come to the meet. Lizzie felt somewhat proud of her establishment\nand her equipage;--but at the same time somewhat fearful. Hitherto\nshe knew but very little of the county people, and was not sure how\nshe might be received;--and then how would it be with her if the fox\nshould at once start away across country, and she should lack either\nthe pluck or the power to follow? There was Sir Griffin to look after\nMiss Roanoke, and Lord George to attend to Mrs. Carbuncle. At last an\nidea so horrible struck her that she could not keep it down. \"What\nam I to do,\" she said, \"if I find myself all alone in a field, and\neverybody else gone away!\"\n\n\"We won't treat you quite in that fashion,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle.\n\n\"The only possible way in which you can be alone in a field is that\nyou will have cut everybody else down,\" said Lord George.\n\n\"I suppose it will all come right,\" said Lizzie, plucking up her\ncourage, and telling herself that a woman can die but once.\n\nEverything was right,--as it usually is. The horses were\nthere,--quite a throng of horses, as the two gentlemen had two each;\nand there was, moreover, a mounted groom to look after the three\nladies. Lizzie had desired to have a groom to herself, but had been\ntold that the expenditure in horseflesh was more than the stable\ncould stand. \"All I ever want of a man is to carry for me my flask,\nand waterproof, and luncheon,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle. \"I don't care if\nI never see a groom, except for that.\"\n\n\"It's convenient to have a gate opened sometimes,\" said Lucinda,\nslowly.\n\n\"Will no one but a groom do that for you?\" asked Sir Griffin.\n\n\"Gentlemen can't open gates,\" said Lucinda. Now, as Sir Griffin\nthought that he had opened many gates during the last season for Miss\nRoanoke, he felt this to be hard.\n\nBut there were eight horses, and eight horses with three servants and\na carriage made quite a throng. Among the crowd of Ayrshire hunting\nmen,--a lord or two, a dozen lairds, two dozen farmers, and as many\nmen of business out of Ayr, Kilmarnock, and away from Glasgow,--it\nwas soon told that Lady Eustace and her party were among them. A good\ndeal had been already heard of Lizzie, and it was at least known of\nher that she had, for her life, the Portray estate in her hands. So\nthere was an undercurrent of whispering, and that sort of commotion\nwhich the appearance of new-comers does produce at a hunt-meet.\nLord George knew one or two men, who were surprised to find him in\nAyrshire, and Mrs. Carbuncle was soon quite at home with a young\nnobleman whom she had met in the vale with the Baron. Sir Griffin did\nnot leave Lucinda's side, and for a while poor Lizzie felt herself\nalone in a crowd.\n\nWho does not know that terrible feeling, and the all but\nnecessity that exists for the sufferer to pretend that he is not\nsuffering,--which again is aggravated by the conviction that the\npretence is utterly vain? This may be bad with a man, but with a\nwoman, who never looks to be alone in a crowd, it is terrible.\nFor five minutes, during which everybody else was speaking to\neverybody,--for five minutes, which seemed to her to be an hour,\nLizzie spoke to no one, and no one spoke to her. Was it for such\nmisery as this that she was spending hundreds upon hundreds, and\nrunning herself into debt? For she was sure that there would be debt\nbefore she had parted with Mrs. Carbuncle. There are people, very\nmany people, to whom an act of hospitality is in itself a good\nthing; but there are others who are always making calculations, and\nendeavouring to count up the thing purchased against the cost. Lizzie\nhad been told that she was a rich woman,--as women go, very rich.\nSurely she was entitled to entertain a few friends; and if Mrs.\nCarbuncle and Miss Roanoke could hunt, it could not be that hunting\nwas beyond her own means. And yet she was spending a great deal of\nmoney. She had seen a large waggon loaded with sacks of corn coming\nup the hill to the Portray stables, and she knew that there would be\na long bill at the corn-chandler's. There had been found a supply\nof wine in the cellars at Portray,--which at her request had been\ninspected by her cousin Frank;--but it had been necessary, so he had\ntold her, to have much more sent down from London,--champagne, and\nliqueurs, and other nice things that cost money. \"You won't like not\nto have them if these people are coming?\" \"Oh, no; certainly not,\"\nsaid Lizzie, with enthusiasm. What other rich people did, she would\ndo. But now, in her five minutes of misery, she counted it all\nup, and was at a loss to find what was to be her return for her\nexpenditure. And then, if on this her first day she should have a\nfall, with no tender hand to help her, and then find that she had\nknocked out her front teeth!\n\nBut the cavalcade began to move, and then Lord George was by her\nside. \"You mustn't be angry if I seem to stick too close to you,\" he\nsaid. She gave him her sweetest smile as she told him that that would\nbe impossible. \"Because, you know, though it's the easiest thing in\nthe world to get along out hunting, and women never come to grief, a\nperson is a little astray at first.\"\n\n\"I shall be so much astray,\" said Lizzie. \"I don't at all know how we\nare going to begin. Are we hunting a fox now?\" At this moment they\nwere trotting across a field or two, through a run of gates up to the\nfirst covert.\n\n\"Not quite yet. The hounds haven't been put in yet. You see that wood\nthere? I suppose they'll draw that.\"\n\n\"What is drawing, Lord George? I want to know all about it, and I am\nso ignorant. Nobody else will tell me.\" Then Lord George gave his\nlesson, and explained the theory and system of fox-hunting. \"We're to\nwait here, then, till the fox runs away? But it's ever so large, and\nif he runs away, and nobody sees him? I hope he will, because it will\nbe nice to go on easily.\"\n\n\"A great many people hope that, and a great many think it nice to go\non easily. Only you must not confess to it.\" Then he went on with\nhis lecture, and explained the meaning of scent, was great on the\ndifficulty of getting away, described the iniquity of heading the\nfox, spoke of up wind and down wind, got as far as the trouble of\n\"carrying,\" and told her that a good ear was everything in a big\nwood,--when there came upon them the thrice-repeated note of an\nold hound's voice, and the quick scampering, and low, timid,\nanxious, trustful whinnying of a dozen comrade younger hounds, who\nrecognised the sagacity of their well-known and highly-appreciated\nelder,--\"That's a fox,\" said Lord George.\n\n\"What shall I do now?\" said Lizzie, all in a twitter.\n\n\"Sit just where you are and light a cigar, if you're given to\nsmoking.\"\n\n\"Pray don't joke with me. You know I want to do it properly.\"\n\n\"And therefore you must sit just where you are, and not gallop about.\nThere's a matter of a hundred and twenty acres here, I should say,\nand a fox doesn't always choose to be evicted at the first notice.\nIt's a chance whether he goes at all from a wood like this. I like\nwoods myself, because, as you say, we can take it easy; but if you\nwant to ride, you should-- By George, they've killed him!\"\n\n\"Killed the fox?\"\n\n\"Yes; he's dead. Didn't you hear?\"\n\n\"And is that a hunt?\"\n\n\"Well;--as far as it goes, it is.\"\n\n\"Why didn't he run away? What a stupid beast! I don't see so very\nmuch in that. Who killed him? That man that was blowing the horn?\"\n\n\"The hounds chopped him.\"\n\n\"Chopped him!\" Lord George was very patient, and explained to Lizzie,\nwho was now indignant and disappointed, the misfortune of chopping.\n\"And are we to go home now? Is it all over?\"\n\n\"They say the country is full of foxes,\" said Lord George. \"Perhaps\nwe shall chop half-a-dozen.\"\n\n\"Dear me! Chop half-a-dozen foxes! Do they like to be chopped? I\nthought they always ran away.\"\n\nLord George was constant and patient, and rode at Lizzie's side from\ncovert to covert. A second fox they did kill in the same fashion as\nthe first; a third they couldn't hunt a yard; a fourth got to ground\nafter five minutes, and was dug out ingloriously;--during which\nprocess a drizzling rain commenced. \"Where is the man with my\nwaterproof?\" demanded Mrs. Carbuncle. Lord George had sent the man to\nsee whether there was shelter to be had in a neighbouring yard. And\nMrs. Carbuncle was angry. \"It's my own fault,\" she said, \"for not\nhaving my own man. Lucinda, you'll be wet.\"\n\n\"I don't mind the wet,\" said Lucinda. Lucinda never did mind\nanything.\n\n\"If you'll come with me, we'll get into a barn,\" said Sir Griffin.\n\n\"I like the wet,\" said Lucinda. All the while seven men were at work\nwith picks and shovels, and the master and four or five of the more\nardent sportsmen were deeply engaged in what seemed to be a mining\noperation on a small scale. The huntsman stood over giving his\norders. One enthusiastic man, who had been lying on his belly,\ngrovelling in the mud for five minutes, with a long stick in his\nhand, was now applying the point of it scientifically to his nose.\nAn ordinary observer with a magnifying-glass might have seen a hair\nat the end of the stick. \"He's there,\" said the enthusiastic man,\ncovered with mud, after a long-drawn, eager sniff at the stick.\nThe huntsman deigned to give one glance. \"That's rabbit,\" said the\nhuntsman. A conclave was immediately formed over the one visible\nhair that stuck to the stick, and three experienced farmers decided\nthat it was rabbit. The muddy enthusiastic man, silenced but not\nconvinced, retired from the crowd, leaving his stick behind him, and\ncomforted himself with his brandy-flask.\n\n\"He's here, my lord,\" said the huntsman to his noble master, \"only\nwe ain't got nigh him yet.\" He spoke almost in a whisper, so that\nthe ignorant crowd should not hear the words of wisdom, which they\nwouldn't understand or perhaps believe. \"It's that full of rabbits\nthat the holes is all hairs. They ain't got no terrier here, I\nsuppose. They never has aught that is wanted in these parts. Work\nround to the right, there;--that's his line.\" The men did work round\nto the right, and in something under an hour the fox was dragged out\nby his brush and hind legs, while the experienced whip who dragged\nhim held the poor brute tight by the back of his neck. \"An old dog,\nmy lord. There's such a many of 'em here, that they'll be a deal\nbetter for a little killing.\" Then the hounds ate their third fox for\nthat day.\n\nLady Eustace, in the meantime, and Mrs. Carbuncle, with Lord George,\nhad found their way to the shelter of a cattle-shed. Lucinda had\nslowly followed, and Sir Griffin had followed her. The gentlemen\nsmoked cigars, and the ladies, when they had eaten their luncheons\nand drank their sherry, were cold and cross. \"If this is hunting,\"\nsaid Lizzie, \"I really don't think so much about it.\"\n\n\"It's Scotch hunting,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle.\n\n\"I have seen foxes dug out south of the Tweed,\" suggested Lord\nGeorge.\n\n\"I suppose everything is slow after the Baron,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle,\nwho had distinguished herself with the Baron's stag-hounds last\nMarch.\n\n\"Are we to go home now?\" asked Lizzie, who would have been\nwell-pleased to have received an answer in the affirmative.\n\n\"I presume they'll draw again,\" exclaimed Mrs. Carbuncle, with an\nangry frown on her brow. \"It's hardly two o'clock.\"\n\n\"They always draw till seven, in Scotland,\" said Lord George.\n\n\"That's nonsense,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle. \"It's dark at four.\"\n\n\"They have torches in Scotland,\" said Lord George.\n\n\"They have a great many things in Scotland that are very far from\nagreeable,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle. \"Lucinda, did you ever see three\nfoxes killed without five minutes' running, before? I never did.\"\n\n\"I've been out all day without finding at all,\" said Lucinda, who\nloved the truth.\n\n\"And so have I,\" said Sir Griffin;--\"often. Don't you remember\nthat day when we went down from London to Bringher Wood, and they\npretended to find at half-past four? That's what I call a sell.\"\n\n\"They're going on, Lady Eustace,\" said Lord George. \"If you're not\ntired, we might as well see it out.\" Lizzie was tired, but said that\nshe was not, and she did see it out. They found a fifth fox, but\nagain there was no scent. \"Who the ---- is to hunt a fox with people\nscurrying about like that!\" said the huntsman, very angrily, dashing\nforward at a couple of riders. \"The hounds is behind you, only you\nain't a-looking. Some people never do look!\" The two peccant riders\nunfortunately were Sir Griffin and Lucinda.\n\nThe day was one of those from which all the men and women return\nhome cross, and which induce some half-hearted folk to declare to\nthemselves that they never will hunt again. When the master decided a\nlittle after three that he would draw no more, because there wasn't a\nyard of scent, our party had nine or ten miles to ride back to their\ncarriages. Lizzie was very tired, and, when Lord George took her from\nher horse, could almost have cried from fatigue. Mrs. Carbuncle was\nnever fatigued, but she had become damp,--soaking wet through, as she\nherself said,--during the four minutes that the man was absent with\nher waterproof jacket, and could not bring herself to forget the\nill-usage she had suffered. Lucinda had become absolutely dumb, and\nany observer would have fancied that the two gentlemen had quarrelled\nwith each other. \"You ought to go on the box now,\" said Sir Griffin,\ngrumbling. \"When you're my age, and I'm yours, I will,\" said Lord\nGeorge, taking his seat in the carriage. Then he appealed to Lizzie.\n\"You'll let me smoke, won't you?\" She simply bowed her head. And\nso they went home,--Lord George smoking, and the ladies dumb.\nLizzie, as she dressed for dinner, almost cried with vexation and\ndisappointment.\n\nThere was a little conversation up-stairs between Mrs. Carbuncle and\nLucinda, when they were free from the attendance of their joint maid.\n\"It seems to me,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle, \"that you won't make up your\nmind about anything.\"\n\n\"There is nothing to make up my mind about.\"\n\n\"I think there is;--a great deal. Do you mean to take this man who is\ndangling after you?\"\n\n\"He isn't worth taking.\"\n\n\"Carruthers says that the property must come right, sooner or later.\nYou might do better, perhaps, but you won't trouble yourself. We\ncan't go on like this for ever, you know.\"\n\n\"If you hated it as much as I do, you wouldn't want to go on.\"\n\n\"Why don't you talk to him? I don't think he's at all a bad fellow.\"\n\n\"I've nothing to say.\"\n\n\"He'll offer to-morrow, if you'll accept him.\"\n\n\"Don't let him do that, Aunt Jane. I couldn't say Yes. As for loving\nhim;--oh, laws!\"\n\n\"It won't do to go on like this, you know.\"\n\n\"I'm only eighteen;--and it's my money, aunt.\"\n\n\"And how long will it last? If you can't accept him, refuse him, and\nlet somebody else come.\"\n\n\"It seems to me,\" said Lucinda, \"that one is as bad as another. I'd a\ndeal sooner marry a shoemaker and help him to make shoes.\"\n\n\"That's downright wickedness,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle. And then they\nwent down to dinner.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\n\nNappie's Grey Horse\n\n\nDuring the leisure of Tuesday, our friends regained their good\nhumour, and on the Wednesday morning they again started for the\nhunting-field. Mrs. Carbuncle, who probably felt that she had behaved\nill about the groom and in regard to Scotland, almost made an\napology, and explained that a cold shower always did make her cross.\n\"My dear Lady Eustace, I hope I wasn't very savage.\" \"My dear Mrs.\nCarbuncle, I hope I wasn't very stupid,\" said Lizzie with a smile.\n\"My dear Lady Eustace, and my dear Mrs. Carbuncle, and my dear Miss\nRoanoke, I hope I wasn't very selfish,\" said Lord George.\n\n\"I thought you were,\" said Sir Griffin.\n\n\"Yes, Griff; and so were you;--but I succeeded.\"\n\n\"I am almost glad that I wasn't of the party,\" said Mr. Emilius,\nwith that musical foreign tone of his. \"Miss Macnulty and I did not\nquarrel; did we?\"\n\n\"No, indeed,\" said Miss Macnulty, who had liked the society of Mr.\nEmilius.\n\nBut on this morning there was an attraction for Lizzie which the\nMonday had wanted. She was to meet her cousin, Frank Greystock. The\njourney was long, and the horses had gone on over night. They went\nby railway to Kilmarnock, and there a carriage from the inn had been\nordered to meet them. Lizzie, as she heard the order given, wondered\nwhether she would have to pay for that, or whether Lord George\nand Sir Griffin would take so much off her shoulders. Young women\ngenerally pay for nothing; and it was very hard that she, who was\nquite a young woman, should have to pay for all. But she smiled,\nand accepted the proposition. \"Oh, yes; of course a carriage at the\nstation. It is so nice to have some one to think of things, like Lord\nGeorge.\" The carriage met them, and everything went prosperously.\nAlmost the first person they saw was Frank Greystock, in a black\ncoat, indeed, but riding a superb grey horse, and looking quite as\nthough he knew what he was about. He was introduced to Mrs. Carbuncle\nand Miss Roanoke and Sir Griffin. With Lord George he had some slight\nprevious acquaintance.\n\n\"You've had no difficulty about a horse?\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"Not the slightest. But I was in an awful fright this morning. I\nwrote to MacFarlane from London, and absolutely hadn't a moment to\ngo to his place yesterday or this morning. I was staying over at\nGlenshiels, and had not a moment to spare in catching the train. But\nI found a horse-box on, and a lad from MacFarlane's just leaving as I\ncame up.\"\n\n\"Didn't he send a boy down with the horse?\" asked Lord George.\n\n\"I believe there is a boy, and the boy'll be awfully bothered. I told\nhim to book the horse for Kilmarnock.\"\n\n\"They always do book for Kilmarnock for this meet,\" said a gentleman\nwho had made acquaintance with some of Lizzie's party on the previous\nhunting-day;--\"but Stewarton is ever so much nearer.\"\n\n\"So somebody told me in the carriage,\" continued Frank, \"and I\ncontrived to get my box off at Stewarton. The guard was uncommon\ncivil, and so was the porter. But I hadn't a moment to look for the\nboy.\"\n\n\"I always make my fellow stick to his horses,\" said Sir Griffin.\n\n\"But you see, Sir Griffin, I haven't got a fellow, and I've only\nhired a horse. But I shall hire a good many horses from Mr.\nMacFarlane if he'll always put me up like this.\"\n\n\"I'm so glad you're here,\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"So am I. I hunt about twice in three years, and no man likes it so\nmuch. I've still got to find out whether the beast can jump.\"\n\n\"Any mortal thing alive, sir,\" said one of those horsey-looking\nmen who are to be found in all hunting-fields, who wear old brown\nbreeches, old black coats, old hunting-caps, who ride screws, and\nnever get thrown out.\n\n\"You know him, do you?\" said Frank.\n\n\"I know him. I didn't know as Muster MacFarlane owned him. No more\nhe don't,\" said the horsey man, turning aside to one of his friends.\n\"That's Nappie's horse, from Jamaica Street.\"\n\n\"Not possible,\" said the friend.\n\n\"You'll tell me I don't know my own horse next.\"\n\n\"I don't believe you ever owned one,\" said the friend.\n\nLizzie was in truth delighted to have her cousin beside her. He had,\nat any rate, forgiven what she had said to him at his last visit,\nor he would not have been there. And then, too, there was a feeling\nof reality in her connexion with him, which was sadly wanting to\nher,--unreal as she was herself,--in her acquaintance with the other\npeople around her. And on this occasion three or four people spoke\nor bowed to her, who had only stared at her before; and the huntsman\ntook off his cap, and hoped that he would do something better for her\nthan on the previous Monday. And the huntsman was very courteous also\nto Miss Roanoke, expressing the same hope, cap in hand, and smiling\ngraciously. A huntsman at the beginning of any day or at the end of a\ngood day is so different from a huntsman at the end of a bad day! A\nhuntsman often has a very bad time out hunting, and it is sometimes a\nmarvel that he does not take the advice which Job got from his wife.\nBut now all things were smiling, and it was soon known that his\nlordship intended to draw Craigattan Gorse. Now in those parts there\nis no surer find, and no better chance of a run, than Craigattan\nGorse affords.\n\n\"There is one thing I want to ask, Mr. Greystock,\" said Lord George,\nin Lizzie's hearing.\n\n\"You shall ask two,\" said Frank.\n\n\"Who is to coach Lady Eustace to-day;--you or I?\"\n\n\"Oh, do let me have somebody to coach me,\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"For devotion in coachmanship,\" said Frank,--\"devotion, that is,\nto my cousin,--I defy the world. In point of skill I yield to Lord\nGeorge.\"\n\n\"My pretensions are precisely the same,\" said Lord George. \"I glow\nwith devotion; my skill is naught.\"\n\n\"I like you best, Lord George,\" said Lizzie, laughing.\n\n\"That settles the question,\" said Lord George.\n\n\"Altogether,\" said Frank, taking off his hat.\n\n\"I mean as a coach,\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"I quite understand the extent of the preference,\" said Lord George.\nLizzie was delighted, and thought the game was worth the candle.\nThe noble master had told her that they were sure of a run from\nCraigattan, and she wasn't in the least tired, and they were not\ncalled upon to stand still in a big wood, and it didn't rain, and,\nin every respect, the day was very different from Monday. Mounted\non a bright-skinned, lively steed, with her cousin on one side and\nLord George de Bruce Carruthers on the other, with all the hunting\nworld of her own county civil around her, and a fox just found in\nCraigattan Gorse, what could the heart of woman desire more? This was\nto live. There was, however, just enough of fear to make the blood\nrun quickly to her heart. \"We'll be away at once now,\" said Lord\nGeorge with utmost earnestness; \"follow me close, but not too close.\nWhen the men see that I am giving you a lead, they won't come\nbetween. If you hang back, I'll not go ahead. Just check your horse\nas he comes to his fences, and, if you can, see me over before you\ngo at them. Now then, down the hill;--there's a gate at the corner,\nand a bridge over the water. We couldn't be better. By George! there\nthey are,--all together. If they don't pull him down in the first two\nminutes, we shall have a run.\"\n\nLizzie understood most of it,--more at least than would nine out of\nten young women who had never ridden a hunt before. She was to go\nwherever Lord George led her, and she was not to ride upon his heels.\nSo much at least she understood,--and so much she was resolved to do.\nThat dread about her front teeth which had perplexed her on Monday\nwas altogether gone now. She would ride as fast as Lucinda Roanoke.\nThat was her prevailing idea. Lucinda, with Mrs. Carbuncle, Sir\nGriffin, and the ladies' groom, was at the other side of the covert.\nFrank had been with his cousin and Lord George, but had crept down\nthe hill while the hounds were in the gorse. A man who likes hunting\nbut hunts only once a year is desirous of doing the best he can with\nhis day. When the hounds came out and crossed the brook at the end\nof the gorse, perhaps he was a little too forward. But, indeed, the\nstate of affairs did not leave much time for waiting, or for the\netiquette of the hunting-field. Along the opposite margin of the\nbrook there ran a low paling, which made the water a rather nasty\nthing to face. A circuit of thirty or forty yards gave the easy\nriding of a little bridge, and to that all the crowd hurried. But one\nor two men with good eyes, and hearts as good, had seen the leading\nhounds across the brook turning up the hill away from the bridge,\nand knew that two most necessary minutes might be lost in the crowd.\nFrank did as they did, having seen nothing of any hounds, but with\ninstinctive knowledge that they were men likely to be right in a\nhunting-field. \"If that ain't Nappie's horse, I'll eat him,\" said one\nof the leading men to the other, as all the three were breasting the\nhill together. Frank only knew that he had been carried over water\nand timber without a mistake, and felt a glow of gratitude towards\nMr. MacFarlane. Up the hill they went, and, not waiting to inquire\ninto the circumstances of a little gate, jumped a four-foot wall and\nwere away. \"How the mischief did he get atop of Nappie's horse?\" said\nthe horsey man to his friend.\n\n\"We're about right for it now,\" said the huntsman, as he came up\nalongside of Frank. He had crossed the bridge, but had been the first\nacross it, and knew how to get over his ground quickly. On they\nwent, the horsey man leading on his thoroughbred screw, the huntsman\nsecond, and Frank third. The pace had already been too good for the\nother horsey man.\n\nWhen Lord George and Lizzie had mounted the hill, there was a rush of\nhorses at the little gate. As they topped the hill Lucinda and Mrs.\nCarbuncle were jumping the wall. Lord George looked back and asked\na question without a word. Lizzie answered it as mutely, Jump it!\nShe was already a little short of breath, but she was ready to jump\nanything that Lucinda Roanoke had jumped. Over went Lord George,\nand she followed him almost without losing the stride of her horse.\nSurely in all the world there was nothing equal to this! There was a\nlarge grass field before them, and for a moment she came up alongside\nof Lord George. \"Just steady him before he leaps,\" said Lord George.\nShe nodded her assent, and smiled her gratitude. She had plenty of\nbreath for riding, but none for speaking. They were now very near to\nLucinda, and Sir Griffin, and Mrs. Carbuncle. \"The pace is too good\nfor Mrs. Carbuncle's horse,\" said Lord George. Oh, if she could only\npass them, and get up to those men whom she saw before her! She knew\nthat one of them was her cousin Frank. She had no wish to pass them,\nbut she did wish that he should see her. In the next fence Lord\nGeorge spied a rail, which he thought safer than a blind hedge, and\nhe made for it. His horse took it well, and so did Lizzie's; but\nLizzie jumped it a little too near him, as he had paused an instant\nto look at the ground. \"Indeed, I won't do it again,\" she said,\ncollecting all her breath for an apology. \"You are going admirably,\"\nhe said, \"and your horse is worth double the money.\" She was so glad\nnow that he had not spared for price in mounting her. Looking to the\nright she could see that Mrs. Carbuncle had only just floundered\nthrough the hedge. Lucinda was still ahead, but Sir Griffin was\nfalling behind, as though divided in duty between the niece and the\naunt. Then they passed through a gate, and Lord George stayed his\nhorse to hold it for her. She tried to thank him but he stopped her.\n\"Don't mind talking, but come along; and take it easy.\" She smiled\nagain, and he told himself that she was wondrous pretty. And then her\npluck was so good! And then she had four thousand a year! \"Now for\nthe gap!--don't be in a hurry. You first, and I'll follow you to keep\noff these two men. Keep to the left, where the other horses have\nbeen.\" On they went, and Lizzie was in heaven. She could not quite\nunderstand her feelings, because it had come to that with her that to\nsave her life she could not have spoken a word. And yet she was not\nonly happy but comfortable. The leaping was delightful, and her horse\ngalloped with her as though his pleasure was as great as her own.\nShe thought that she was getting nearer to Lucinda. For her, in her\nheart, Lucinda was the quarry. If she could only pass Lucinda! That\nthere were any hounds she had altogether forgotten. She only knew\nthat two or three men were leading the way, of whom her cousin Frank\nwas one, that Lucinda Roanoke was following them closely, and that\nshe was gaining upon Lucinda Roanoke. She knew she was gaining a\nlittle, because she could see now how well and squarely Lucinda sat\nupon her horse. As for herself, she feared that she was rolling;--but\nshe need not have feared. She was so small, and lithe, and light,\nthat her body adapted itself naturally to the pace of her horse.\nLucinda was of a different build, and it behoved her to make for\nherself a perfect seat. \"We must have the wall,\" said Lord George,\nwho was again at her side for a moment. She would have \"had\" a castle\nwall, moat included, turrets and all, if he would only have shown her\nthe way. The huntsman and Frank had taken the wall. The horsey man's\nbit of blood, knowing his own powers to an inch, had declined,--not\nroughly, with a sudden stop and a jerk, but with a swerve to the left\nwhich the horsey man at once understood. What the brute lacked in\njumping he could make up in pace, and the horsey man was along the\nwall and over a broken bank at the head of it, with the loss of not\nmore than a minute. Lucinda's horse, following the ill example,\nbalked the jump. She turned him round with a savage gleam in her eye\nwhich Lizzie was just near enough to see, struck him rapidly over\nthe shoulders with her whip, and the animal flew with her into the\nnext field. \"Oh, if I could do it like that!\" thought Lizzie. But\nin that very minute she was doing it, not only as well but better.\nNot following Lord George, but close at his side, the little animal\nchanged his pace, trotted for a yard or two, hopped up as though the\nwall were nothing, knocked off a top stone with his hind feet, and\ndropped onto the ground so softly that Lizzie hardly believed that\nshe had gone over the big obstruction that had cost Lucinda such an\neffort. Lucinda's horse came down on all four legs, with a grunt\nand a groan, and she knew that she had bustled him. At that moment\nLucinda was very full of wrath against the horsey man with the screw\nwho had been in her way. \"He touched it,\" gasped Lizzie, thinking\nthat her horse had disgraced himself. \"He's worth his weight in\ngold,\" said Lord George. \"Come along. There's a brook with a ford.\nMorgan is in it.\" Morgan was the huntsman. \"Don't let them get before\nyou.\" Oh, no. She would let no one get before her. She did her very\nbest, and just got her horse's nose on the broken track leading down\ninto the brook before Lucinda. \"Pretty good, isn't it?\" said Lucinda.\nLizzie smiled sweetly. She could smile, though she could not speak.\n\"Only they do balk one so at one's fences!\" said Lucinda. The horsey\nman had all but regained his place, and was immediately behind\nLucinda, within hearing--as Lucinda knew.\n\nOn the further side of the field, beyond the brook, there was a\nlittle spinny, and for half a minute the hounds came to a check.\n\"Give 'em time, sir, give 'em time,\" said Morgan to Frank, speaking\nin full good humour, with no touch of Monday's savagery. \"Wind him,\nBolton; Beaver's got it. Very good thing, my lady, isn't it? Now,\nCarstairs, if you're a-going to 'unt the fox, you'd better 'unt him.\"\nCarstairs was the horsey man,--and one with whom Morgan very often\nquarrelled. \"That's it, my hearties,\" and Morgan was across a broken\nwall in a moment, after the leading hounds. \"Are we to go on?\" said\nLizzie, who feared much that Lucinda would get ahead of her. There\nwas a matter of three dozen horsemen up now, and, as far as Lizzie\nsaw, the whole thing might have to be done again. In hunting, to have\nridden is the pleasure;--and not simply to have ridden well, but to\nhave ridden better than others. \"I call it very awkward ground,\"\nsaid Mrs. Carbuncle, coming up. \"It can't be compared to the Baron's\ncountry.\" \"Stone walls four feet and a half high, and well built, are\nawkward,\" said the noble master.\n\nBut the hounds were away again, and Lizzie had got across the gap\nbefore Lucinda, who, indeed, made way for her hostess with a haughty\npoliteness which was not lost upon Lizzie. Lizzie could not stop to\nbeg pardon, but she would remember to do it in her prettiest way on\ntheir journey home. They were now on a track of open country, and\nthe pace was quicker even than before. The same three men were still\nleading, Morgan, Greystock, and Carstairs. Carstairs had slightly the\nbest of it; and of course Morgan swore afterwards that he was among\nthe hounds the whole run. \"The scent was that good, there wasn't no\nputting of 'em off;--no thanks to him,\" said Morgan. \"I 'ate to see\n'em galloping, galloping, galloping, with no more eye to the 'ounds\nthan a pig. Any idiot can gallop, if he's got it under 'im.\" All\nwhich only signified that Jack Morgan didn't like to see any of his\nfield before him. There was need, indeed, now for galloping, and it\nmay be doubted whether Morgan himself was not doing his best. There\nwere about five or six in the second flight, and among these Lord\nGeorge and Lizzie were well placed. But Lucinda had pressed again\nahead. \"Miss Roanoke had better have a care, or she'll blow her\nhorse,\" Lord George said. Lizzie didn't mind what happened to Miss\nRoanoke's horse, so that it could be made to go a little slower and\nfall behind. But Lucinda still pressed on, and her animal went with\na longer stride than Lizzie's horse.\n\nThey now crossed a road, descending a hill, and were again in a close\ncountry. A few low hedges seemed as nothing to Lizzie. She could\nsee her cousin gallop over them ahead of her, as though they were\nnothing; and her own horse, as he came to them, seemed to do exactly\nthe same. On a sudden they found themselves abreast with the\nhuntsman. \"There's a biggish brook below there, my lord,\" said he.\nLizzie was charmed to hear it. Hitherto she had jumped all the big\nthings so easily, that it was a pleasure to hear of them. \"How are\nwe to manage it?\" asked Lord George. \"It is rideable, my lord; but\nthere's a place about half a mile down. Let's see how'll they head.\nDrat it, my lord, they've turned up, and we must have it or go back\nto the road.\" Morgan hurried on, showing that he meant to \"have\" it,\nas did also Lucinda. \"Shall we go to the road?\" said Lord George.\n\"No, no!\" said Lizzie. Lord George looked at her and at her horse,\nand then galloped after the huntsman and Lucinda. The horsey man with\nthe well-bred screw was first over the brook. The little animal could\ntake almost any amount of water, and his rider knew the spot. \"He'll\ndo it like a bird,\" he had said to Greystock, and Greystock had\nfollowed him. Mr. MacFarlane's hired horse did do it like a bird. \"I\nknow him, sir,\" said Carstairs. \"Mr. Nappie gave \u00c2\u00a3250 for him down in\nNorthamptonshire last February;--bought him of Mr. Percival. You know\nMr. Percival, sir?\" Frank knew neither Mr. Percival nor Mr. Nappie,\nand at this moment cared nothing for either of them. To him, at this\nmoment, Mr. MacFarlane, of Buchanan Street, Glasgow, was the best\nfriend he ever had.\n\nMorgan, knowing well the horse he rode, dropped him into the brook,\nfloundered and half swam through the mud and water, and scrambled out\nsafely on the other side. \"He wouldn't have jumped it with me, if I'd\nasked him ever so,\" he said afterwards. Lucinda rode at it, straight\nas an arrow, but her brute came to a dead balk, and, but that she\nsat well, would have thrown her into the stream. Lord George let\nLizzie take the leap before he took it, knowing that, if there were\nmisfortune, he might so best render help. To Lizzie it seemed as\nthough the river were the blackest, and the deepest, and the broadest\nthat ever ran. For a moment her heart quailed;--but it was but for a\nmoment. She shut her eyes, and gave the little horse his head. For a\nmoment she thought that she was in the water. Her horse was almost\nupright on the bank, with his hind-feet down among the broken ground,\nand she was clinging to his neck. But she was light, and the beast\nmade good his footing, and then she knew that she had done it. In\nthat moment of the scramble her heart had been so near her mouth that\nshe was almost choked. When she looked round, Lord George was already\nby her side. \"You hardly gave him powder enough,\" he said, \"but still\nhe did it beautifully. Good heavens! Miss Roanoke is in the river.\"\nLizzie looked back, and there, in truth, was Lucinda struggling with\nher horse in the water. They paused a moment, and then there were\nthree or four men assisting her. \"Come on,\" said Lord George;--\"there\nare plenty to take her out, and we couldn't get to her if we stayed.\"\n\n\"I ought to stop,\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"You couldn't get back if you gave your eyes for it,\" said Lord\nGeorge. \"She's all right.\" So instigated, Lizzie followed her leader\nup the hill, and in a minute was close upon Morgan's heels.\n\nThe worst of doing a big thing out hunting is the fact that in nine\ncases out of ten they who don't do it are as well off as they who\ndo. If there were any penalty for riding round, or any mark given to\nthose who had ridden straight,--so that justice might in some sort\nbe done,--it would perhaps be better. When you have nearly broken\nyour neck to get to hounds, or made your horse exert himself beyond\nhis proper power, and then find yourself, within three minutes,\novertaking the hindmost ruck of horsemen on a road because of some\niniquitous turn that the fox has taken, the feeling is not pleasant.\nAnd some man who has not ridden at all, who never did ride at all,\nwill ask you where you have been; and his smile will give you the lie\nin your teeth if you make any attempt to explain the facts. Let it be\nsufficient for you at such a moment to feel that you are not ashamed\nof yourself. Self-respect will support a man even in such misery as\nthis.\n\nThe fox on this occasion, having crossed the river, had not left\nits bank, but had turned from his course up the stream, so that the\nleading spirits who had followed the hounds over the water came upon\na crowd of riders on the road in a space something short of a mile.\nMrs. Carbuncle, among others, was there, and had heard of Lucinda's\nmishap. She said a word to Lord George in anger, and Lord George\nanswered her. \"We were over the river before it happened, and if we\nhad given our eyes we couldn't have got to her. Don't you make a fool\nof yourself!\" The last words were spoken in a whisper, but Lizzie's\nsharp ears caught them.\n\n\"I was obliged to do what I was told,\" said Lizzie apologetically.\n\n\"It will be all right, dear Lady Eustace. Sir Griffin is with her. I\nam so glad you are going so well.\"\n\nThey were off again now, and the stupid fox absolutely went back\nacross the river. But, whether on one side or on the other, his\nstruggle for life was now in vain. Two years of happy, free existence\namidst the wilds of Craigattan had been allowed him. Twice previously\nhad he been \"found,\" and the kindly storm or not less beneficent\nbrightness of the sun had enabled him to baffle his pursuers. Now\nthere had come one glorious day, and the common lot of mortals must\nbe his. A little spurt there was, back towards his own home,--just\nenough to give something of selectness to the few who saw him\nfall,--and then he fell. Among the few were Frank, and Lord George,\nand our Lizzie. Morgan was there, of course, and one of his whips.\nOf Ayrshire folk, perhaps five or six, and among them our friend\nMr. Carstairs. They had run him down close to the outbuildings of a\nfarm-yard, and they broke him up in the home paddock.\n\n\"What do you think of hunting?\" said Frank to his cousin.\n\n\"It's divine!\"\n\n\"My cousin went pretty well, I think,\" he said to Lord George.\n\n\"Like a celestial bird of Paradise. No one ever went better;--or I\nbelieve so well. You've been carried rather nicely yourself.\"\n\n\"Indeed I have,\" said Frank, patting his still palpitating horse,\n\"and he's not to say tired now.\"\n\n\"You've taken it pretty well out of him, sir,\" said Carstairs. \"There\nwas a little bit of hill that told when we got over the brook. I\nknow'd you'd find he'd jump a bit.\"\n\n\"I wonder whether he's to be bought?\" asked Frank in his enthusiasm.\n\n\"I don't know the horse that isn't,\" said Mr. Carstairs,--\"so long as\nyou don't stand at the figure.\"\n\nThey were collected on the farm road, and now, as they were speaking,\nthere was a commotion among the horses. A man, driving a little\nbuggy, was forcing his way along the road, and there was a sound of\nvoices, as though the man in the buggy were angry. And he was very\nangry. Frank, who was on foot by his horse's head, could see that the\nman was dressed for hunting, with a bright red coat and a flat hat,\nand that he was driving the pony with a hunting-whip. The man was\ntalking as he approached, but what he said did not much matter to\nFrank. It did not much matter to Frank till his new friend, Mr.\nCarstairs, whispered a word in his ear. \"It's Nappie, by gum!\" Then\nthere crept across Frank's mind an idea that there might be trouble\ncoming.\n\n\"There he is,\" said Nappie, bringing his pony to a dead stop with a\nchuck, and jumping out of the buggy. \"I say, you, sir; you've stole\nmy 'orse!\" Frank said not a word, but stood his ground with his hand\non the nag's bridle. \"You've stole my 'orse; you've stole him off\nthe rail. And you've been a-riding him all day. Yes, you 'ave. Did\never anybody see the like of this? Why, the poor beast can't a'most\nstand!\"\n\n\"I got him from Mr. MacFarlane.\"\n\n\"MacFarlane be blowed! You didn't do nothing of the kind. You stole\nhim off the rail at Stewarton. Yes, you did;--and him booked to\nKilmarnock. Where's a police? Who's to stand the like o' this? I say,\nmy lord,--just look at this.\" A crowd had now been formed round poor\nFrank, and the master had come up. Mr. Nappie was a Huddersfield man,\nwho had come to Glasgow in the course of the last winter, and whose\npopularity in the hunting-field was not as yet quite so great as it\nperhaps might have been.\n\n\"There's been a mistake, I suppose,\" said the master.\n\n\"Mistake, my lord! Take a man's 'orse off the rail at Stewarton,\nand him booked to Kilmarnock, and ride him to a standstill! It's no\nmistake at all. It's 'orse-nobbling; that's what it is. Is there\nany police here, sir?\" This he said, turning round to a farmer. The\nfarmer didn't deign any reply. \"Perhaps you'll tell me your name,\nsir? if you've got a name. No gen'leman ever took a gen'leman's 'orse\noff the rail like that.\"\n\n\"Oh, Frank, do come away,\" said Lizzie, who was standing by.\n\n\"We shall be all right in two minutes,\" said Frank.\n\n\"No, we sha'n't,\" said Mr. Nappie,--\"nor yet in two hours. I've asked\nwhat's your name?\"\n\n\"My name is--Greystock.\"\n\n\"Greystockings,\" said Mr. Nappie more angrily than ever. \"I don't\nbelieve in no such name. Where do you live?\" Then somebody whispered\na word to him. \"Member of Parliament,--is he? I don't care a ----. A\nmember of Parliament isn't to steal my 'orse off the rail, and him\nbooked to Kilmarnock. Now, my lord, what'd you do if you was served\nlike that?\" This was another appeal to the noble master.\n\n\"I should express a hope that my horse had carried the gentleman as\nhe liked to be carried,\" said the master.\n\n\"And he has,--carried me remarkably well,\" said Frank;--whereupon\nthere was a loud laugh among the crowd.\n\n\"I wish he'd broken the infernal neck of you, you scoundrel,\nyou,--that's what I do!\" said Mr. Nappie. \"There was my man, and my\n'orse, and myself all booked from Glasgow to Kilmarnock;--and when I\ngot there what did the guard say to me?--why, just that a man in a\nblack coat had taken my horse off at Stewarton; and now I've been\ndriving all about the country in that gig there for three hours!\"\nWhen Mr. Nappie had got so far as this in his explanation he was\nalmost in tears. \"I'll make 'im pay, that I will. Take your hand off\nmy horse's bridle, sir. Is there any gentleman here as would like to\ngive two hundred and eighty guineas for a horse, and then have him\nrid to a standstill by a fellow like that down from London? If you're\nin Parliament, why don't you stick to Parliament? I don't suppose\nhe's worth fifty pound this moment.\"\n\nFrank had all the while been endeavouring to explain the accident;\nhow he had ordered a horse from Mr. MacFarlane, and the rest of\nit,--as the reader will understand; but quite in vain. Mr. Nappie in\nhis wrath would not hear a word. But now that he spoke about money,\nFrank thought that he saw an opening. \"Mr. Nappie,\" he said, \"I'll\nbuy the horse for the price you gave for him.\"\n\n\"I'll see you ----; extremely well ---- first,\" said Mr. Nappie.\n\nThe horse had now been surrendered to Mr. Nappie, and Frank suggested\nthat he might as well return to Kilmarnock in the gig, and pay for\nthe hire of it. But Mr. Nappie would not allow him to set a foot upon\nthe gig. \"It's my gig for the day,\" said he, \"and you don't touch it.\nYou shall foot it all the way back to Kilmarnock, Mr. Greystockings.\"\nBut Mr. Nappie, in making this threat, forgot that there were\ngentlemen there with second horses. Frank was soon mounted on one\nbelonging to Lord George, and Lord George's servant, at the corner of\nthe farm-yard, got into the buggy, and was driven back to Kilmarnock\nby the man who had accompanied poor Mr. Nappie in their morning's\nhunt on wheels after the hounds.\n\n\"Upon my word, I was very sorry,\" said Frank as he rode back with his\nfriends to Kilmarnock; \"and when I first really understood what had\nhappened, I would have done anything. But what could I say? It was\nimpossible not to laugh, he was so unreasonable.\"\n\n\"I should have put my whip over his shoulder,\" said a stout farmer,\nmeaning to be civil to Frank Greystock.\n\n\"Not after using it so often over his horse,\" said Lord George.\n\n\"I never had to touch him once,\" said Frank.\n\n\"And are you to have it all for nothing?\" asked the thoughtful\nLizzie.\n\n\"He'll send a bill in, you'll find,\" said a bystander.\n\n\"Not he,\" said Lord George. \"His grievance is worth more to him than\nhis money.\"\n\nNo bill did come to Frank, and he got his mount for nothing. When\nMr. MacFarlane was applied to, he declared that no letter ordering a\nhorse had been delivered in his establishment. From that day to this\nMr. Nappie's grey horse has had a great character in Ayrshire; but\nall the world there says that its owner never rides him as Frank\nGreystock rode him that day.\n\n\n\n\nVOLUME II\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX\n\nSir Griffin Takes an Unfair Advantage\n\n\nWe must return to the unfortunate Lucinda, whom we last saw\nstruggling with her steed in the black waters of the brook which she\nattempted to jump. A couple of men were soon in after her, and she\nwas rescued and brought back to the side from which she had taken off\nwithout any great difficulty. She was neither hurt nor frightened,\nbut she was wet through; and for a while she was very unhappy,\nbecause it was not found quite easy to extricate her horse. During\nthe ten minutes of her agony, while the poor brute was floundering in\nthe mud, she had been quite disregardful of herself, and had almost\nseemed to think that Sir Griffin, who was with her, should go into\nthe water after her steed. But there were already two men in the\nwater, and three on the bank, and Sir Griffin thought that duty\nrequired him to stay by the young lady's side. \"I don't care a bit\nabout myself,\" said Lucinda, \"but if anything can be done for poor\nWarrior!\" Sir Griffin assured her that \"poor Warrior\" was receiving\nthe very best attention; and then he pressed upon her the dangerous\ncondition in which she herself was standing,--quite wet through,\ncovered, as to her feet and legs, with mud, growing colder and colder\nevery minute. She touched her lips with a little brandy that somebody\ngave her, and then declared again that she cared for nothing but\npoor Warrior. At last poor Warrior was on his legs, with the water\ndripping from his black flanks, with his nose stained with mud,\nwith one of his legs a little cut,--and, alas! with the saddle wet\nthrough. Nevertheless, there was nothing to be done better than to\nride into Kilmarnock. The whole party must return to Kilmarnock,\nand, perhaps, if they hurried, she might be able to get her clothes\ndry before they would start by the train. Sir Griffin, of course,\naccompanied her, and they two rode into the town alone. Mrs.\nCarbuncle did hear of the accident soon after the occurrence, but had\nnot seen her niece; nor when she heard of it, could she have joined\nLucinda.\n\nIf anything would make a girl talk to a man, such a ducking as\nLucinda had had would do so. Such sudden events, when they come in\nthe shape of misfortune, or the reverse, generally have the effect\nof abolishing shyness for the time. Let a girl be upset with you in\na railway train, and she will talk like a Rosalind, though before\nthe accident she was as mute as death. But with Lucinda Roanoke the\naccustomed change did not seem to take place. When Sir Griffin had\nplaced her on her saddle, she would have trotted all the way into\nKilmarnock without a word if he would have allowed her. But he,\nat least, understood that such a joint misfortune should create\nconfidence,--for he, too, had lost the run, and he did not intend to\nlose his opportunity also. \"I am so glad that I was near you,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"Oh, thank you, yes; it would have been bad to be alone.\"\n\n\"I mean that I am glad that it was I,\" said Sir Griffin. \"It's very\nhard even to get a moment to speak to you.\" They were now trotting\nalong on the road, and there were still three miles before them.\n\n\"I don't know,\" said she. \"I'm always with the other people.\"\n\n\"Just so.\" And then he paused. \"But I want to find you when you're\nnot with the other people. Perhaps, however, you don't like me.\"\n\nAs he paused for a reply, she felt herself bound to say something.\n\"Oh, yes, I do,\" she said,--\"as well as anybody else.\"\n\n\"And is that all?\"\n\n\"I suppose so.\"\n\nAfter that he rode on for the best part of another mile before he\nspoke to her again. He had made up his mind that he would do it. He\nhardly knew why it was that he wanted her. He had not determined that\nhe was desirous of the charms or comfort of domestic life. He had\nnot even thought where he would live were he married. He had not\nsuggested to himself that Lucinda was a desirable companion, that her\ntemper would suit his, that her ways and his were sympathetic, or\nthat she would be a good mother to the future Sir Griffin Trewett.\nHe had seen that she was a very handsome girl, and therefore he had\nthought that he would like to possess her. Had she fallen like a ripe\nplum into his mouth, or shown herself ready so to fall, he would\nprobably have closed his lips and backed out of the affair. But the\ndifficulty no doubt added something to the desire. \"I had hoped,\" he\nsaid, \"that after knowing each other so long there might have been\nmore than that.\"\n\nShe was again driven to speak because he paused. \"I don't know that\nthat makes much difference.\"\n\n\"Miss Roanoke, you can't but understand what I mean.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I don't,\" said she.\n\n\"Then I'll speak plainer.\"\n\n\"Not now, Sir Griffin, because I'm so wet.\"\n\n\"You can listen to me even if you will not answer me. I am sure that\nyou know that I love you better than all the world. Will you be\nmine?\" Then he moved on a little forward so that he might look back\ninto her face. \"Will you allow me to think of you as my future wife?\"\n\nMiss Roanoke was able to ride at a stone wall or at a river, and to\nride at either the second time when her horse balked the first. Her\nheart was big enough for that. But her heart was not big enough to\nenable her to give Sir Griffin an answer. Perhaps it was that, in\nregard to the river and the stone wall, she knew what she wanted; but\nthat, as to Sir Griffin, she did not. \"I don't think this is a proper\ntime to ask,\" she said.\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because I am wet through and cold. It is taking an unfair\nadvantage.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean to take any unfair advantage,\" said Sir Griffin\nscowling--\"I thought we were alone--\"\n\n\"Oh, Sir Griffin, I am so tired!\" As they were now entering\nKilmarnock, it was quite clear he could press her no further. They\nclattered up, therefore, to the hotel, and he busied himself in\ngetting a bedroom fire lighted, and in obtaining the services of the\nlandlady. A cup of tea was ordered, and toast, and in two minutes\nLucinda Roanoke was relieved from the presence of the baronet. \"It's\na kind of thing a fellow doesn't quite understand,\" said Sir Griffin\nto himself. \"Of course she means it, and why the devil can't she\nsay so?\" He had no idea of giving up the chase, but he thought that\nperhaps he would take it out of her when she became Lady Tewett.\n\nThey were an hour at the inn before Mrs. Carbuncle and Lady Eustace\narrived, and during that hour Sir Griffin did not see Miss Roanoke.\nFor this there was, of course, ample reason. Under the custody of the\nlandlady, Miss Roanoke was being made dry and clean, and was by no\nmeans in a condition to receive a lover's vows. The baronet sent up\nhalf-a-dozen messages as he sauntered about the yard of the inn, but\nhe got no message in return. Lucinda, as she sat drinking her tea and\ndrying her clothes, did no doubt think about him,--but she thought\nabout him as little as she could. Of course, he would come again, and\nshe could make up her mind then. It was no doubt necessary that she\nshould do something. Her fortune, such as it was, would soon be spent\nin the adventure of finding a husband. She also had her ideas about\nlove, and had enough of sincerity about her to love a man thoroughly;\nbut it had seemed to her that all the men who came near her were\nmen whom she could not fail to dislike. She was hurried here and\nhurried there, and knew nothing of real social intimacies. As she\ntold her aunt in her wickedness, she would almost have preferred a\nshoemaker,--if she could have become acquainted with a shoemaker in\na manner that should be unforced and genuine. There was a savageness\nof antipathy in her to the mode of life which her circumstances had\nproduced for her. It was that very savageness which made her ride so\nhard, and which forbade her to smile and be pleasant to people whom\nshe could not like. And yet she knew that something must be done. She\ncould not afford to wait as other girls might do. Why not Sir Griffin\nas well as any other fool? It may be doubted whether she knew how\nobstinate, how hard, how cruel to a woman a fool can be.\n\nHer stockings had been washed and dried, and her boots and trousers\nwere nearly dry, when Mrs. Carbuncle, followed by Lizzie, rushed into\nthe room. \"Oh, my darling, how are you?\" said the aunt, seizing her\nniece in her arms.\n\n\"I'm only dirty now,\" said Lucinda.\n\n\"We've got off the biggest of the muck, my lady,\" said the landlady.\n\n\"Oh, Miss Roanoke,\" said Lizzie, \"I hope you don't think I behaved\nbadly in going on.\"\n\n\"Everybody always goes on, of course,\" said Lucinda.\n\n\"I did so pray Lord George to let me try and jump back to you. We\nwere over, you know, before it happened. But he said it was quite\nimpossible. We did wait till we saw you were out.\"\n\n\"It didn't signify at all, Lady Eustace.\"\n\n\"And I was so sorry when I went through the wall at the corner of\nthe wood before you. But I was so excited I hardly knew what I\nwas doing.\" Lucinda, who was quite used to these affairs in the\nhunting-field, simply nodded her acceptance of this apology. \"But it\nwas a glorious run; wasn't it?\"\n\n\"Pretty well,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle.\n\n\"Oh, it was glorious,--but then I got over the river. And oh, if you\nhad been there afterwards. There was such an adventure between a man\nin a gig and my cousin Frank.\" Then they all went to the train, and\nwere carried home to Portray.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL\n\n\"You Are Not Angry?\"\n\n\nOn their journey back to Portray, the ladies were almost too tired\nfor talking; and Sir Griffin was sulky. Sir Griffin had as yet heard\nnothing about Greystock's adventure, and did not care to be told.\nBut when once they were at the castle, and had taken warm baths, and\nglasses of sherry, and got themselves dressed and had come down to\ndinner, they were all very happy. To Lizzie it had certainly been the\nmost triumphant day of her life. Her marriage with Sir Florian had\nbeen triumphant, but that was only a step to something good that was\nto come after. She then had at her own disposal her little wits and\nher prettiness, and a world before her in which, as it then seemed\nto her, there was a deal of pleasure if she could only reach it. Up\nto this period of her career she had hardly reached any pleasure;\nbut this day had been very pleasant. Lord George de Bruce Carruthers\nhad in truth been her Corsair, and she had found the thing which\nshe liked to do, and would soon know how to do. How glorious it was\nto jump over that black, yawning stream, and then to see Lucinda\nfall into it! And she could remember every jump, and her feeling of\necstasy as she landed on the right side. And she had by heart every\nkind word that Lord George had said to her,--and she loved the sweet,\npleasant, Corsair-like intimacy that had sprung up between them. She\nwondered whether Frank was at all jealous. It wouldn't be amiss that\nhe should be a little jealous. And then somebody had brought home in\nhis pocket the fox's brush, which the master of the hounds had told\nthe huntsman to give her. It was all delightful;--and so much more\ndelightful because Mrs. Carbuncle had not gone quite so well as she\nliked to go, and because Lucinda had fallen into the water.\n\nThey did not dine till past eight, and the ladies and gentlemen all\nleft the room together. Coffee and liqueurs were to be brought into\nthe drawing-room, and they were all to be intimate, comfortable,\nand at their ease;--all except Sir Griffin Tewett, who was still\nvery sulky. \"Did he say anything?\" Mrs. Carbuncle had asked. \"Yes.\"\n\"Well?\" \"He proposed; but of course I could not answer him when I was\nwet through.\" There had been but a moment, and in that moment this\nwas all that Lucinda would say.\n\n\"Now I don't mean to stir again,\" said Lizzie, throwing herself into\na corner of a sofa, \"till somebody carries me to bed. I never was\nso tired in all my life.\" She was tired, but there is a fatigue\nwhich is delightful as long as all the surroundings are pleasant and\ncomfortable.\n\n\"I didn't call it a very hard day,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle.\n\n\"You only killed one fox,\" said Mr. Emilius, pretending a\ndelightfully clerical ignorance, \"and on Monday you killed four. Why\nshould you be tired?\"\n\n\"I suppose it was nearly twenty miles,\" said Frank, who was also\nignorant.\n\n\"About ten, perhaps,\" said Lord George. \"It was an hour and forty\nminutes, and there was a good bit of slow hunting after we had come\nback over the river.\"\n\n\"I'm sure it was thirty,\" said Lizzie, forgetting her fatigue in her\nenergy.\n\n\"Ten is always better than twenty,\" said Lord George, \"and five\ngenerally better than ten.\"\n\n\"It was just whatever is best,\" said Lizzie. \"I know Frank's friend,\nMr. Nappie, said it was twenty. By-the-bye, Frank, oughtn't we to\nhave asked Mr. Nappie home to dinner?\"\n\n\"I thought so,\" said Frank; \"but I couldn't take the liberty myself.\"\n\n\"I really think poor Mr. Nappie was very badly used,\" said Mrs.\nCarbuncle.\n\n\"Of course he was,\" said Lord George;--\"no man ever worse since\nhunting was invented. He was entitled to a dozen dinners and no end\nof patronage; but you see he took it out in calling your cousin Mr.\nGreystockings.\"\n\n\"I felt that blow,\" said Frank.\n\n\"I shall always call you Cousin Greystockings,\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"It was hard,\" continued Lord George, \"and I understood it all so\nwell when he got into a mess in his wrath about booking the horse\nto Kilmarnock. If the horse had been on the roadside, he or his men\ncould have protected him. He is put under the protection of a whole\nrailway company, and the company gives him up to the first fellow\nthat comes and asks for him.\"\n\n\"It was cruel,\" said Frank.\n\n\"If it had happened to me, I should have been very angry,\" said Mrs.\nCarbuncle.\n\n\"But Frank wouldn't have had a horse at all,\" said Lizzie, \"unless he\nhad taken Mr. Nappie's.\"\n\nLord George still continued his plea for Mr. Nappie. \"There's\nsomething in that, certainly; but, still, I agree with Mrs.\nCarbuncle. If it had happened to me, I should--just have committed\nmurder and suicide. I can't conceive anything so terrible. It's all\nvery well for your noble master to talk of being civil, and hoping\nthat the horse had carried him well, and all that. There are\ncircumstances in which a man can't be civil. And then everybody\nlaughed at him! It's the way of the world. The lower you fall, the\nmore you're kicked.\"\n\n\"What can I do for him?\" asked Frank.\n\n\"Put him down at your club, and order thirty dozen of grey shirtings\nfrom Nappie and Co., without naming the price.\"\n\n\"He'd send you grey stockings instead,\" said Lizzie.\n\nBut though Lizzie was in heaven, it behoved her to be careful. The\nCorsair was a very fine specimen of the Corsair breed;--about the\nbest Corsair she had ever seen, and had been devoted to her for the\nday. But these Corsairs are known to be dangerous, and it would not\nbe wise that she should sacrifice any future prospect of importance\non behalf of a feeling, which, no doubt, was founded on poetry, but\nwhich might too probably have no possible beneficial result. As far\nas she knew, the Corsair had not even an island of his own in the\n\u00c3\u0086gean Sea. And, if he had, might not the island too probably have a\nMedora or two of its own? In a ride across the country the Corsair\nwas all that a Corsair should be; but knowing, as she did, but very\nlittle of the Corsair, she could not afford to throw over her cousin\nfor his sake. As she was leaving the drawing-room, she managed to say\none word to her cousin. \"You were not angry with me because I got\nLord George to ride with me instead of you?\"\n\n\"Angry with you?\"\n\n\"I knew I should only be a hindrance to you.\"\n\n\"It was a matter of course. He knows all about it, and I know\nnothing. I am very glad that you liked it so much.\"\n\n\"I did like it;--and so did you. I was so glad you got that poor\nman's horse. You were not angry then?\" They had now passed across the\nhall, and were on the bottom stair.\n\n\"Certainly not.\"\n\n\"And you are not angry for what happened before?\" She did not look\ninto his face as she asked this question, but stood with her eyes\nfixed on the stair-carpet.\n\n\"Indeed no.\"\n\n\"Good night, Frank.\"\n\n\"Good night, Lizzie.\" Then she went, and he returned to a room below\nwhich had been prepared for purposes of tobacco and soda-water and\nbrandy.\n\n\"Why, Griff, you're rather out of sorts to-night,\" said Lord George\nto his friend, before Frank had joined them.\n\n\"So would you be out of sorts if you'd lost your run and had to pick\na young woman out of the water. I don't like young women when they're\ndamp and smell of mud.\"\n\n\"You mean to marry her, I suppose?\"\n\n\"How would you like me to ask you questions? Do you mean to marry the\nwidow? And, if you do, what'll Mrs. Carbuncle say? And if you don't,\nwhat do you mean to do; and all the rest of it?\"\n\n\"As for marrying the widow, I should like to know the facts first.\nAs to Mrs. C., she wouldn't object in the least. I generally have\nmy horses so bitted that they can't very well object. And as to the\nother question, I mean to stay here for the next fortnight, and I\nadvise you to make it square with Miss Roanoke. Here's my lady's\ncousin; for a man who doesn't ride often, he went very well to-day.\"\n\n\"I wonder if he'd take a twenty-pound note if I sent it to him,\" said\nFrank, when they broke up for the night. \"I don't like the idea of\nriding such a fellow's horse for nothing.\"\n\n\"He'll bring an action against the railway, and then you can offer to\npay if you like.\" Mr. Nappie did bring an action against the railway,\nclaiming exorbitant damages;--but with what result, we need not\ntrouble ourselves to inquire.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI\n\n\"Likewise the Bears in Couples Agree\"\n\n\nFrank Greystock stayed till the following Monday at Portray, but\ncould not be induced to hunt on the Saturday,--on which day the other\nsporting men and women went to the meet. He could not, he said, trust\nto that traitor MacFarlane, and he feared that his friend Mr. Nappie\nwould not give him another mount on the grey horse. Lizzie offered\nhim one of her two darlings,--an offer which he, of course, refused;\nand Lord George also proposed to put him up. But Frank averred that\nhe had ridden his hunt for that season, and would not jeopardise the\nlaurels he had gained. \"And, moreover,\" said he, \"I should not dare\nto meet Mr. Nappie in the field.\" So he remained at the castle and\ntook a walk with Mr. Emilius. Mr. Emilius asked a good many questions\nabout Portray, and exhibited the warmest sympathy with Lizzie's\nwidowed condition. He called her a \"sweet, gay, unsophisticated,\nlight-hearted young thing.\" \"She is very young,\" replied her cousin.\n\"Yes,\" he continued, in answer to further questions; \"Portray is\ncertainly very nice. I don't know what the income is. Well; yes.\nI should think it is over a thousand. Eight! No, I never heard it\nsaid that it was as much as that.\" When Mr. Emilius put it down\nin his mind as five, he was not void of acuteness, as very little\ninformation had been given to him.\n\nThere was a joke throughout the castle that Mr. Emilius had fallen in\nlove with Miss Macnulty. They had been a great deal together on those\nhunting days; and Miss Macnulty was unusually enthusiastic in praise\nof his manner and conversation. To her, also, had been addressed\nquestions as to Portray and its income, all of which she had answered\nto the best of her ability;--not intending to betray any secret, for\nshe had no secret to betray; but giving ordinary information on that\ncommonest of all subjects, our friends' incomes. Then there had risen\na question whether there was a vacancy for such promotion to Miss\nMacnulty. Mrs. Carbuncle had certainly heard that there was a Mrs.\nEmilius. Lucinda was sure that there was not,--an assurance which\nmight have been derived from a certain eagerness in the reverend\ngentleman's demeanour to herself on a former occasion. To Lizzie, who\nat present was very good-natured, the idea of Miss Macnulty having\na lover, whether he were a married man or not, was very delightful.\n\"I'm sure I don't know what you mean,\" said Miss Macnulty. \"I don't\nsuppose Mr. Emilius had any idea of the kind.\" Upon the whole,\nhowever, Miss Macnulty liked it.\n\nOn the Saturday nothing especial happened. Mr. Nappie was out on\nhis grey horse, and condescended to a little conversation with Lord\nGeorge. He wouldn't have minded, he said, if Mr. Greystock had come\nforward; but he did think Mr. Greystock hadn't come forward as he\nought to have done. Lord George professed that he had observed the\nsame thing; but then, as he whispered into Mr. Nappie's ear, Mr.\nGreystock was particularly known as a bashful man. \"He didn't ride\nmy 'orse anyway bashful,\" said Mr. Nappie;--all of which was told at\ndinner in the evening, amidst a great deal of laughter. There had\nbeen nothing special in the way of sport, and Lizzie's enthusiasm for\nhunting, though still high, had gone down a few degrees below fever\nheat. Lord George had again coached her; but there had been no great\nneed for coaching, no losing of her breath, no cutting down of\nLucinda, no river, no big wall,--nothing, in short, very fast. They\nhad been much in a big wood; but Lizzie, in giving an account of the\nday to her cousin, had acknowledged that she had not quite understood\nwhat they were doing at any time. \"It was a blowing of horns and\na galloping up and down all the day,\" she said; \"and then Morgan\ngot cross again and scolded all the people. But there was one nice\npaling, and Dandy flew over it beautifully. Two men tumbled down, and\none of them was a good deal hurt. It was very jolly;--but not at all\nlike Wednesday.\"\n\nNor had it been like Wednesday to Lucinda Roanoke, who did not fall\ninto the water, and who did accept Sir Griffin when he again proposed\nto her in Sarkie wood. A great deal had been said to Lucinda on the\nThursday and the Friday by Mrs. Carbuncle,--which had not been taken\nat all in good part by Lucinda. On those days Lucinda kept as much as\nshe could out of Sir Griffin's way, and almost snapped at the baronet\nwhen he spoke to her. Sir Griffin swore to himself that he wasn't\ngoing to be treated that way. He'd have her, by George! There are\nmen in whose love a good deal of hatred is mixed;--who love as the\nhuntsman loves the fox, towards the killing of which he intends to\nuse all his energies and intellects. Mrs. Carbuncle, who did not\nquite understand the sort of persistency by which a Sir Griffin can\nbe possessed, feared greatly that Lucinda was about to lose her\nprize, and spoke out accordingly. \"Will you, then, just have the\nkindness to tell me what it is you propose to yourself?\" asked Mrs.\nCarbuncle.\n\n\"I don't propose anything.\"\n\n\"And where will you go when your money's done?\"\n\n\"Just where I am going now!\" said Lucinda. By which it may be feared\nthat she indicated a place to which she should not on such an\noccasion have made an allusion.\n\n\"You don't like anybody else?\" suggested Mrs. Carbuncle.\n\n\"I don't like anybody or anything,\" said Lucinda.\n\n\"Yes, you do;--you like horses to ride, and dresses to wear.\"\n\n\"No, I don't. I like hunting because, perhaps, some day I may break\nmy neck. It's no use your looking like that, Aunt Jane. I know what\nit all means. If I could break my neck it would be the best thing for\nme.\"\n\n\"You'll break my heart, Lucinda.\"\n\n\"Mine's broken long ago.\"\n\n\"If you'll accept Sir Griffin, and just get a home round yourself,\nyou'll find that everything will be happy. It all comes from the\ndreadful uncertainty. Do you think I have suffered nothing? Carbuncle\nis always threatening that he'll go back to New York, and as for Lord\nGeorge, he treats me that way I'm sometimes afraid to show my face.\"\n\n\"Why should you care for Lord George?\"\n\n\"It's all very well to say, why should I care for him. I don't\ncare for him, only one doesn't want to quarrel with one's friends.\nCarbuncle says he owes him money.\"\n\n\"I don't believe it,\" said Lucinda.\n\n\"And he says Carbuncle owes him money.\"\n\n\"I do believe that,\" said Lucinda.\n\n\"Between it all, I don't know which way to be turning. And now, when\nthere's this great opening for you, you won't know your own mind.\"\n\n\"I know my mind well enough.\"\n\n\"I tell you you'll never have such another chance. Good looks isn't\neverything. You've never a word to say to anybody; and when a man\ndoes come near you, you're as savage and cross as a bear.\"\n\n\"Go on, Aunt Jane.\"\n\n\"What with your hatings and dislikings, one would suppose you didn't\nthink God Almighty made men at all.\"\n\n\"He made some of 'em very bad,\" said Lucinda. \"As for some others,\nthey're only half made. What can Sir Griffin do, do you suppose?\"\n\n\"He's a gentleman.\"\n\n\"Then if I were a man, I should wish not to be a gentleman; that's\nall. I'd a deal sooner marry a man like that huntsman, who has\nsomething to do and knows how to do it.\" Again she said, \"Don't worry\nany more, Aunt Jane. It doesn't do any good. It seems to me that to\nmake myself Sir Griffin's wife would be impossible; but I'm sure\nyour talking won't do it.\" Then her aunt left her, and, having met\nLord George, at his bidding went and made civil speeches to Lizzie\nEustace.\n\nThat was on the Friday afternoon. On the Saturday afternoon Sir\nGriffin, biding his time, found himself, in a ride with Lucinda,\nsufficiently far from other horsemen for his purpose. He wasn't going\nto stand any more nonsense. He was entitled to an answer, and he\nknew that he was entitled, by his rank and position, to a favourable\nanswer. Here was a girl who, as far as he knew, was without a\nshilling, of whose birth and parentage nobody knew anything, who\nhad nothing but her beauty to recommend her,--nothing but that and\na certain capacity for carrying herself in the world as he thought\nladies should carry themselves,--and she was to give herself airs\nwith him, and expect him to propose to her half a dozen times! By\nGeorge!--he had a very good mind to go away and let her find out\nher mistake. And he would have done so,--only that he was a man who\nalways liked to have all that he wanted. It was intolerable to him\nthat anybody should refuse him anything. \"Miss Roanoke,\" he said; and\nthen he paused.\n\n\"Sir Griffin,\" said Lucinda, bowing her head.\n\n\"Perhaps you will condescend to remember what I had the honour of\nsaying to you as we rode into Kilmarnock last Wednesday.\"\n\n\"I had just been dragged out of a river, Sir Griffin, and I don't\nthink any girl ought to be asked to remember what was said to her in\nthat condition.\"\n\n\"If I say it again now, will you remember?\"\n\n\"I cannot promise, Sir Griffin.\"\n\n\"Will you give me an answer?\"\n\n\"That must depend.\"\n\n\"Come;--I will have an answer. When a man tells a lady that he\nadmires her, and asks her to be his wife, he has a right to an\nanswer. Don't you think that in such circumstances a man has a right\nto expect an answer?\"\n\nLucinda hesitated for a moment, and he was beginning again to\nremonstrate impatiently, when she altered her tone, and replied to\nhim seriously, \"In such circumstances a gentleman has a right to\nexpect an answer.\"\n\n\"Then give me one. I admire you above all the world, and I ask you to\nbe my wife. I'm quite in earnest.\"\n\n\"I know that you are in earnest, Sir Griffin. I would do neither you\nnor myself the wrong of supposing that it could be otherwise.\"\n\n\"Very well then. Will you accept the offer that I make you?\"\n\nAgain she paused. \"You have a right to an answer,--of course; but it\nmay be so difficult to give it. It seems to me that you have hardly\nrealised how serious a question it is.\"\n\n\"Haven't I, though! By George, it is serious!\"\n\n\"Will it not be better for you to think it over again?\"\n\nHe now hesitated for a moment. Perhaps it might be better. Should she\ntake him at his word there would be no going back from it. But Lord\nGeorge knew that he had proposed before. Lord George had learned\nthis from Mrs. Carbuncle, and had shown that he knew it. And then,\ntoo,--he had made up his mind about it. He wanted her, and he meant\nto have her. \"It requires no more thinking with me, Lucinda. I'm not\na man who does things without thinking; and when I have thought I\ndon't want to think again. There's my hand;--will you have it?\"\n\n\"I will,\" said Lucinda, putting her hand into his. He no sooner felt\nher assurance than his mind misgave him that he had been precipitate,\nthat he had been rash, and that she had taken advantage of him. After\nall, how many things are there in the world more precious than a\nhandsome girl. And she had never told him that she loved him.\n\n\"I suppose you love me?\" he asked.\n\n\"H'sh!--here they all are.\" The hand was withdrawn, but not before\nboth Mrs. Carbuncle and Lady Eustace had seen it.\n\nMrs. Carbuncle, in her great anxiety, bided her time, keeping close\nto her niece. Perhaps she felt that if the two were engaged, it might\nbe well to keep the lovers separated for awhile, lest they should\nquarrel before the engagement should have been so confirmed by the\nauthority of friends as to be beyond the power of easy annihilation.\nLucinda rode quite demurely with the crowd. Sir Griffin remained near\nher, but without speaking. Lizzie whispered to Lord George that there\nhad been a proposal. Mrs. Carbuncle sat in stately dignity on her\nhorse, as though there were nothing which at that moment especially\nengaged her attention. An hour almost had passed before she was able\nto ask the important question, \"Well;--what have you said to him?\"\n\n\"Oh;--just what you would have me.\"\n\n\"You have accepted him?\"\n\n\"I suppose I was obliged. At any rate I did. You shall know\none thing, Aunt Jane, at any rate, and I hope it will make you\ncomfortable. I hate a good many people; but of all the people in the\nworld I hate Sir Griffin Tewett the worst.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, Lucinda.\"\n\n\"It shall be nonsense, if you please; but it's true. I shall have to\nlie to him,--but there shall be no lying to you, however much you may\nwish it. I hate him!\"\n\nThis was very grim, but Mrs. Carbuncle quite understood that to\npersons situated in great difficulty things might be grim. A\ncertain amount of grimness must be endured. And she knew, too, that\nLucinda was not a girl to be driven without showing something of an\nintractable spirit in harness. Mrs. Carbuncle had undertaken the\ndriving of Lucinda, and had been not altogether unsuccessful. The\nthing so necessary to be done was now effected. Her niece was engaged\nto a man with a title, to a man reported to have a fortune, to a man\nof family, and a man of the world. Now that the engagement was made,\nthe girl could not go back from it, and it was for Mrs. Carbuncle to\nsee that neither should Sir Griffin go back. Her first steps must be\ntaken at once. The engagement should be made known to all the party,\nand should be recognised by some word spoken between herself and\nthe lover. The word between herself and the lover must be the first\nthing. She herself, personally, was not very fond of Sir Griffin; but\non such an occasion as this she could smile and endure the bear. Sir\nGriffin was a bear,--but so also was Lucinda. \"The rabbits and hares\nAll go in pairs; And likewise the bears In couples agree.\" Mrs.\nCarbuncle consoled herself with the song, and assured herself that it\nwould all come right. No doubt the she-bears were not as civil to the\nhe-bears as the turtle doves are to each other. It was, perhaps, her\nmisfortune that her niece was not a turtle dove; but, such as she\nwas, the best had been done for her. \"Dear Sir Griffin,\" she said on\nthe first available opportunity, not caring much for the crowd, and\nalmost desirous that her very words should be overheard, \"my darling\ngirl has made me so happy by what she has told me.\"\n\n\"She hasn't lost any time,\" said Sir Griffin.\n\n\"Of course she would lose no time. She is the same to me as a\ndaughter. I have no child of my own, and she is everything to me. May\nI tell you that you are the luckiest man in Europe?\"\n\n\"It isn't every girl that would suit me, Mrs. Carbuncle.\"\n\n\"I am sure of that. I have noticed how particular you are. I won't\nsay a word of Lucinda's beauty. Men are better judges of that than\nwomen; but for high, chivalrous spirit, for true principle and\nnobility, and what I call downright worth, I don't think you will\neasily find her superior. And she is as true as steel.\"\n\n\"And about as hard, I was beginning to think.\"\n\n\"A girl like that, Sir Griffin, does not give herself away easily.\nYou will not like her the less for that now that you are the\npossessor. She is very young, and has known my wish that she should\nnot engage herself to any one quite yet. But, as it is, I cannot\nregret anything.\"\n\n\"I daresay not,\" said Sir Griffin.\n\nThat the man was a bear was a matter of course, and bears probably\ndo not themselves know how bearish they are. Sir Griffin, no doubt,\nwas unaware of the extent of his own rudeness. And his rudeness\nmattered but little to Mrs. Carbuncle, so long as he acknowledged the\nengagement. She had not expected a lover's raptures from the one more\nthan from the other. And was not there enough in the engagement to\nsatisfy her? She allowed, therefore, no cloud to cross her brow as\nshe rode up alongside of Lord George. \"Sir Griffin has proposed,\nand she has accepted him,\" she said in a whisper. She was not now\ndesirous that any one should hear her but he to whom she spoke.\n\n\"Of course she has,\" said Lord George.\n\n\"I don't know about that, George. Sometimes I thought she would, and\nsometimes that she wouldn't. You have never understood Lucinda.\"\n\n\"I hope Griff will understand her,--that's all. And now that the\nthing is settled, you'll not trouble me about it any more. Their woes\nbe on their own head. If they come to blows Lucinda will thrash him,\nI don't doubt. But while it's simply a matter of temper and words,\nshe won't find Tewett so easy-going as he looks.\"\n\n\"I believe they'll do very well together.\"\n\n\"Perhaps they will. There's no saying who may do well together. You\nand Carbuncle get on \u00c3\u00a0 merveille. When is it to be?\"\n\n\"Of course nothing is settled yet.\"\n\n\"Don't be too hard about settlements, or, maybe, he'll find a way of\nwriggling out. When a girl without a shilling asks very much, the\nworld supports a man for breaking his engagement. Let her pretend to\nbe indifferent about it;--that will be the way to keep him firm.\"\n\n\"What is his income, George?\"\n\n\"I haven't an idea. There never was a closer man about money. I\nbelieve he must have the bulk of the Tewett property some day. He\ncan't spend above a couple of thousand now.\"\n\n\"He's not in debt, is he?\"\n\n\"He owes me a little money,--twelve hundred or so, and I mean to have\nit. I suppose he is in debt, but not much, I think. He makes stupid\nbets, and the devil won't break him of it.\"\n\n\"Lucinda has two or three thousand pounds, you know.\"\n\n\"That's a flea-bite. Let her keep it. You're in for it now, and you'd\nbetter say nothing about money. He has a decent solicitor, and let\nhim arrange about the settlements. And look here, Jane;--get it done\nas soon as you can.\"\n\n\"You'll help me?\"\n\n\"If you don't bother me, I will.\"\n\nOn their way home Mrs. Carbuncle was able to tell Lady Eustace. \"You\nknow what has occurred?\"\n\n\"Oh, dear, yes,\" said Lizzie, laughing.\n\n\"Has Lucinda told you?\"\n\n\"Do you think I've got no eyes? Of course it was going to be. I knew\nthat from the very moment Sir Griffin reached Portray. I am so glad\nthat Portray has been useful.\"\n\n\"Oh, so useful, dear Lady Eustace! Not but what it must have come off\nanywhere, for there never was a man so much in love as Sir Griffin.\nThe difficulty has been with Lucinda.\"\n\n\"She likes him, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, of course,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle with energy.\n\n\"Not that girls ever really care about men now. They've got to be\nmarried, and they make the best of it. She's very handsome, and I\nsuppose he's pretty well off.\"\n\n\"He will be very rich indeed. And they say he's such an excellent\nyoung man when you know him.\"\n\n\"I dare say most young men are excellent,--when you come to know\nthem. What does Lord George say?\"\n\n\"He's in raptures. He is very much attached to Lucinda, you know.\"\nAnd so that affair was managed. They hadn't been home a quarter of an\nhour before Frank Greystock was told. He asked Mrs. Carbuncle about\nthe sport, and then she whispered to him, \"An engagement has been\nmade.\"\n\n\"Sir Griffin?\" suggested Frank. Mrs. Carbuncle smiled and nodded her\nhead. It was well that everybody should know it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII\n\nSunday Morning\n\n\n\"So, miss, you've took him?\" said the joint Abigail of the Carbuncle\nestablishment that evening to the younger of her two mistresses. Mrs.\nCarbuncle had resolved that the thing should be quite public. \"Just\nremember this,\" replied Lucinda, \"I don't want to have a word said to\nme on the subject.\" \"Only just to wish you joy, miss.\" Lucinda turned\nround with a flash of anger at the girl. \"I don't want your wishing.\nThat'll do. I can manage by myself. I won't have you come near me if\nyou can't hold your tongue when you're told.\" \"I can hold my tongue\nas well as anybody,\" said the Abigail with a toss of her head.\n\nThis happened after the party had separated for the evening. At\ndinner Sir Griffin had, of course, given Lucinda his arm; but so he\nhad always done since they had been at Portray. Lucinda hardly opened\nher mouth at table, and had retreated to bed with a headache when the\nmen, who on that day lingered a few minutes after the ladies, went\ninto the drawing-room. This Sir Griffin felt to be almost an affront,\nas there was a certain process of farewell for the night which he had\nanticipated. If she was going to treat him like that, he would cut up\nrough, and she should know it. \"Well, Griff, so it's all settled,\"\nsaid Lord George in the smoking-room. Frank Greystock was there, and\nSir Griffin did not like it.\n\n\"What do you mean by settled? I don't know that anything is settled.\"\n\n\"I thought it was. Weren't you told so?\"--and Lord George turned to\nGreystock.\n\n\"I thought I heard a hint,\" said Frank.\n\n\"I'm ---- if I ever knew such people in my life!\" said Sir Griffin.\n\"They don't seem to have an idea that a man's own affairs may be\nprivate.\"\n\n\"Such an affair as that never is private,\" said Lord George. \"The\nwomen take care of that. You don't suppose they're going to run down\ntheir game, and let nobody know it.\"\n\n\"If they take me for game--\"\n\n\"Of course you're game. Every man's game. Only some men are such bad\ngame that they ain't worth following. Take it easy, Griff; you're\ncaught.\"\n\n\"No; I ain't.\"\n\n\"And enjoy the satisfaction of knowing that she's about the\nhandsomest girl out. As for me, I'd sooner have the widow. I beg your\npardon, Mr. Greystock.\" Frank merely bowed. \"Simply, I mean, because\nshe rides about two stone lighter. It'll cost you something to mount\nLady Tewett.\"\n\n\"I don't mean that she shall hunt,\" said Sir Griffin. It will be\nseen, therefore, that the baronet made no real attempt to deny his\nengagement.\n\nOn the following day, which was a Sunday, Sir Griffin, having\nascertained that Miss Roanoke did not intend to go to church, stayed\nat home also. Mr. Emilius had been engaged to preach at the nearest\nepiscopal place of worship, and the remainder of the party all\nwent to hear him. Lizzie was very particular about her Bible and\nPrayer-book, and Miss Macnulty wore a brighter ribbon on her bonnet\nthan she had ever been known to carry before. Lucinda, when she had\nheard of the arrangement, had protested to her aunt that she would\nnot go down-stairs till they had all returned; but Mrs. Carbuncle,\nfearing the anger of Sir Griffin, doubting whether, in his anger,\nhe might not escape them altogether, said a word or two which\neven Lucinda found to be rational. \"As you have accepted him, you\nshouldn't avoid him, my dear. That is only making things worse for\nthe future. And then it's cowardly, is it not?\" No word that could\nhave been spoken was more likely to be efficacious. At any rate, she\nwould not be cowardly.\n\nAs soon then as the wheels of the carriage were no longer heard\ngrating upon the road, Lucinda, who had been very careful in her\ndress,--so careful as to avoid all appearance of care,--with slow\nmajestic step descended to a drawing-room which they were accustomed\nto use on mornings. It was probable that Sir Griffin was smoking\nsomewhere about the grounds, but it could not be her duty to go after\nhim out of doors. She would remain there, and, if he chose, he might\ncome to her. There could be no ground of complaint on his side if\nshe allowed herself to be found in one of the ordinary sitting-rooms\nof the house. In about half an hour he sauntered upon the terrace,\nand flattened his nose against the window. She bowed and smiled to\nhim,--hating herself for smiling. It was perhaps the first time that\nshe had endeavoured to put on a pleasant face wherewithal to greet\nhim. He said nothing then, but passed round the house, threw away\nthe end of his cigar, and entered the room. Whatever happened, she\nwould not be a coward. The thing had to be done. Seeing that she had\naccepted him on the previous day, had not run away in the night or\ntaken poison, and had come down to undergo the interview, she would\nundergo it at least with courage. What did it matter, even though he\nshould embrace her? It was her lot to undergo misery, and as she had\nnot chosen to take poison, the misery must be endured. She rose as he\nentered and gave him her hand. She had thought what she would do, and\nwas collected and dignified. He had not, and was very awkward. \"So\nyou haven't gone to church, Sir Griffin,--as you ought,\" she said,\nwith another smile.\n\n\"Come; I've gone as much as you.\"\n\n\"But I had a headache. You stayed away to smoke cigars.\"\n\n\"I stayed to see you, my girl.\" A lover may call his lady love his\ngirl, and do so very prettily. He may so use the word that she will\nlike it, and be grateful in her heart for the sweetness of the sound.\nBut Sir Griffin did not do it nicely. \"I've got ever so much to say\nto you.\"\n\n\"I won't flatter you by saying that I stayed to hear it.\"\n\n\"But you did;--didn't you now?\" She shook her head, but there was\nsomething almost of playfulness in her manner of doing it. \"Ah, but I\nknow you did. And why shouldn't you speak out, now that we are to be\nman and wife? I like a girl to speak out. I suppose if I want to be\nwith you, you want as much to be with me; eh?\"\n\n\"I don't see that that follows.\"\n\n\"By ----, if it doesn't, I'll be off!\"\n\n\"You must please yourself about that, Sir Griffin.\"\n\n\"Come; do you love me? You have never said you loved me.\" Luckily\nperhaps for her he thought that the best assurance of love was a\nkiss. She did not revolt, or attempt to struggle with him; but the\nhot blood flew over her entire face, and her lips were very cold to\nhis, and she almost trembled in his grasp. Sir Griffin was not a man\nwho could ever have been the adored of many women, but the instincts\nof his kind were strong enough within him to make him feel that she\ndid not return his embrace with passion. He had found her to be very\nbeautiful;--but it seemed to him that she had never been so little\nbeautiful as when thus pressed close to his bosom. \"Come,\" he said,\nstill holding her; \"you'll give me a kiss?\"\n\n\"I did do it,\" she said.\n\n\"No;--nothing like it. Oh, if you won't, you know--\"\n\nOn a sudden she made up her mind, and absolutely did kiss him. She\nwould sooner have leaped at the blackest, darkest, dirtiest river in\nthe county. \"There,\" she said, \"that will do,\" gently extricating\nherself from his arms. \"Some girls are different, I know; but you\nmust take me as I am, Sir Griffin;--that is, if you do take me.\"\n\n\"Why can't you drop the Sir?\"\n\n\"Oh yes;--I can do that.\"\n\n\"And you do love me?\" There was a pause, while she tried to swallow\nthe lie. \"Come;--I'm not going to marry any girl who is ashamed to\nsay that she loves me. I like a little flesh and blood. You do love\nme?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said. The lie was told; and for the moment he had to be\nsatisfied. But in his heart he didn't believe her. It was all very\nwell for her to say that she wasn't like other girls. Why shouldn't\nshe be like other girls? It might, no doubt, suit her to be made Lady\nTewett;--but he wouldn't make her Lady Tewett if she gave herself\nairs with him. She should lie on his breast and swear that she loved\nhim beyond all the world;--or else she should never be Lady Tewett.\nDifferent from other girls indeed! She should know that he was\ndifferent from other men. Then he asked her to come and take a walk\nabout the grounds. To that she made no objection. She would get her\nhat and be with him in a minute.\n\nBut she was absent more than ten minutes. When she was alone she\nstood before her glass looking at herself, and then she burst into\ntears. Never before had she been thus polluted. The embrace had\ndisgusted her. It made her odious to herself. And if this, the\nbeginning of it, were so bad, how was she to drink the cup to the\nbitter dregs? Other girls, she knew, were fond of their lovers,--some\nso fond of them that all moments of absence were moments, if not of\npain, at any rate of regret. To her, as she stood there ready to tear\nherself because of the vileness of her own condition, it now seemed\nas though no such love as that were possible to her. For the sake\nof this man who was to be her husband, she hated all men. Was not\neverything around her base, and mean, and sordid? She had understood\nthoroughly the quick divulgings of Mrs. Carbuncle's tidings, the\nworking of her aunt's anxious mind. The man, now that he had been\ncaught, was not to be allowed to escape. But how great would be the\nboon if he would escape. How should she escape? And yet she knew that\nshe meant to go on and bear it all. Perhaps by study and due practice\nshe might become,--as were some others,--a beast of prey, and nothing\nmore. The feeling that had made these few minutes so inexpressibly\nloathsome to her might, perhaps, be driven from her heart. She washed\nthe tears from her eyes with savage energy and descended to her lover\nwith a veil fastened closely under her hat. \"I hope I haven't kept\nyou waiting,\" she said.\n\n\"Women always do,\" he replied laughing. \"It gives them importance.\"\n\n\"It is not so with me, I can assure you. I will tell you the truth. I\nwas agitated,--and I cried.\"\n\n\"Oh, ay; I dare say.\" He rather liked the idea of having reduced\nthe haughty Lucinda to tears. \"But you needn't have been ashamed of\nmy seeing it. As it is, I can see nothing. You must take that off\npresently.\"\n\n\"Not now, Griffin.\" Oh, what a name it was! It seemed to blister her\ntongue as she used it without the usual prefix.\n\n\"I never saw you tied up in that way before. You don't do it out\nhunting. I've seen you when the snow has been driving in your face,\nand you didn't mind it,--not so much as I did.\"\n\n\"You can't be surprised that I should be agitated now.\"\n\n\"But you're happy;--ain't you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said. The lie once told must of course be continued.\n\n\"Upon my word, I don't quite understand you,\" said Sir Griffin. \"Look\nhere, Lucinda; if you want to back out of it, you can, you know.\"\n\n\"If you ask me again, I will.\" This was said with the old savage\nvoice, and it at once reduced Sir Griffin to thraldom. To be rejected\nnow would be the death of him. And should there come a quarrel he was\nsure that it would seem to be that he had been rejected.\n\n\"I suppose it's all right,\" he said; \"only when a man is only\nthinking how he can make you happy, he doesn't like to find nothing\nbut crying.\" After this there was but little more said between them\nbefore they returned to the castle.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII\n\nLife at Portray\n\n\nOn the Monday Frank took his departure. Everybody at the castle had\nliked him except Sir Griffin, who, when he had gone, remarked to\nLucinda that he was an insufferable legal prig, and one of those\nchaps who think themselves somebody because they are in Parliament.\nLucinda had liked Frank, and said so very boldly. \"I see what it is,\"\nreplied Sir Griffin; \"you always like the people I don't.\" When he\nwas going, Lizzie left her hand in his for a moment, and gave one\nlook up into his eyes. \"When is Lucy to be made blessed?\" she asked.\n\"I don't know that Lucy will ever be made blessed,\" he replied, \"but\nI am sure I hope she will.\" Not a word more was said, and he returned\nto London.\n\nAfter that Mrs. Carbuncle and Lucinda remained at Portray Castle till\nafter Christmas, greatly overstaying the original time fixed for\ntheir visit. Lord George and Sir Griffin went and returned, and went\nagain and returned again. There was much hunting and a great many\nlove passages, which need not be recorded here. More than once during\nthese six or seven weeks there arose a quarrel, bitter, loud, and\npronounced, between Sir Griffin and Lucinda; but Lord George and Mrs.\nCarbuncle between them managed to throw oil upon the waters, and when\nChristmas came the engagement was still an engagement. The absolute\nsuggestion that it should be broken, and abandoned, and thrown to the\nwinds, always came from Lucinda; and Sir Griffin, when he found that\nLucinda was in earnest, would again be moved by his old desires,\nand would determine that he would have the thing he wanted. Once he\nbehaved with such coarse brutality that nothing but an abject apology\nwould serve the turn. He made the abject apology, and after that\nbecame conscious that his wings were clipped, and that he must do as\nhe was bidden. Lord George took him away, and brought him back again,\nand blew him up;--and at last, under pressure from Mrs. Carbuncle,\nmade him consent to the fixing of a day. The marriage was to take\nplace during the first week in April. When the party moved from\nPortray, he was to go up to London and see his lawyer. Settlements\nwere to be arranged, and something was to be fixed as to future\nresidence.\n\nIn the midst of all this Lucinda was passive as regarded the making\nof the arrangements, but very troublesome to those around her as to\nher immediate mode of life. Even to Lady Eustace she was curt and\nuncivil. To her aunt she was at times ferocious. She told Lord George\nmore than once to his face that he was hurrying her to perdition.\n\"What the d---- is it you want?\" Lord George said to her. \"Not to be\nmarried to this man.\" \"But you have accepted him. I didn't ask you to\ntake him. You don't want to go into a workhouse, I suppose?\" Then she\nrode so hard that all the Ayrshire lairds were startled out of their\npropriety, and there was a general fear that she would meet some\nterrible accident. And Lizzie, instigated by jealousy, learned to\nride as hard, and as they rode against each other every day, there\nwas a turmoil in the hunt. Morgan, scratching his head, declared that\nhe had known \"drunken rampaging men,\" but had never seen ladies so\nwicked. Lizzie did come down rather badly at one wall, and Lucinda\ngot herself jammed against a gate-post. But when Christmas was\ncome and gone, and Portray Castle had been left empty, no very bad\naccident had occurred.\n\nA great friendship had sprung up between Mrs. Carbuncle and Lizzie,\nso that both had become very communicative. Whether both or either\nhad been candid may, perhaps, be doubted. Mrs. Carbuncle had been\nquite confidential in discussing with her friend the dangerous\nvarieties of Lucinda's humours, and the dreadful aversion which she\nstill seemed to entertain for Sir Griffin. But then these humours\nand this aversion were so visible, that they could not well be\nconcealed;--and what can be the use of confidential communications if\nthings are kept back which the confidante would see even if they were\nnot told? \"She would be just like that whoever the man was,\" said\nMrs. Carbuncle.\n\n\"I suppose so,\" said Lizzie, wondering at such a phenomenon in\nfemale nature. But, with this fact understood between them to be a\nfact,--namely, that Lucinda would be sure to hate any man whom she\nmight accept,--they both agreed that the marriage had better go on.\n\n\"She must take a husband, some day, you know,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle.\n\n\"Of course,\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"With her good looks, it would be out of the question that she\nshouldn't be married.\"\n\n\"Quite out of the question,\" repeated Lizzie.\n\n\"And I really don't see how she's to do better. It's her nature, you\nknow. I have had enough of it, I can tell you. And at the pension,\nnear Paris, they couldn't break her in at all. Nobody ever could\nbreak her in. You see it in the way she rides.\"\n\n\"I suppose Sir Griffin must do it,\" said Lizzie laughing.\n\n\"Well;--that, or the other thing, you know.\" But there was no doubt\nabout this;--whoever might break or be broken, the marriage must go\non. \"If you don't persevere with one like her, Lady Eustace, nothing\ncan be done.\" Lizzie quite concurred. What did it matter to her\nwho should break, or who be broken, if she could only sail her own\nlittle bark without dashing it on the rocks? Rocks there were. She\ndidn't quite know what to make of Lord George, who certainly was a\nCorsair,--who had said some very pretty things to her, quite \u00c3\u00a0 la\nCorsair. But in the meantime, from certain rumours that she heard,\nshe believed that Frank had given up, or at least was intending\nto give up, the little chit who was living with Lady Linlithgow.\nThere had been something of a quarrel,--so, at least, she had heard\nthrough Miss Macnulty, with whom Lady Linlithgow still occasionally\ncorresponded in spite of their former breaches. From Frank, Lizzie\nheard repeatedly, but Frank in his letters never mentioned the name\nof Lucy Morris. Now, if there should be a division between Frank and\nLucy, then, she thought, Frank would return to her. And if so, for a\npermanent holding rock of protection in the world, her cousin Frank\nwould be at any rate safer than the Corsair.\n\nLizzie and Mrs. Carbuncle had quite come to understand each other\ncomfortably about money. It suited Mrs. Carbuncle very well to remain\nat Portray. It was no longer necessary that she should carry Lucinda\nabout in search of game to be run down. The one head of game needed\nhad been run down, such as it was,--not, indeed, a very noble stag;\nbut the stag had been accepted; and a home for herself and her niece,\nwhich should have about it a sufficient air of fashion to satisfy\npublic opinion,--out of London,--better still, in Scotland, belonging\nto a person with a title, enjoying the appurtenances of wealth, and\none to which Lord George and Sir Griffin could have access,--was very\ndesirable. But it was out of the question that Lady Eustace should\nbear all the expense. Mrs. Carbuncle undertook to find the stables,\nand did pay for that rick of hay and for the cart-load of forage\nwhich had made Lizzie's heart quake as she saw it dragged up the hill\ntowards her own granaries. It is very comfortable when all these\nthings are clearly understood. Early in January they were all to go\nback to London. Then for a while,--up to the period of Lucinda's\nmarriage,--Lizzie was to be Mrs. Carbuncle's guest at the small house\nin Mayfair;--but Lizzie was to keep the carriage. There came at last\nto be some little attempt, perhaps, at a hard bargain at the hand of\neach lady, in which Mrs. Carbuncle, as the elder, probably got the\nadvantage. There was a question about the liveries in London. The\nfootman there must appertain to Mrs. Carbuncle, whereas the coachman\nwould as necessarily be one of Lizzie's retainers. Mrs. Carbuncle\nassented at last to finding the double livery,--but, like a prudent\nwoman, arranged to get her quid pro quo. \"You can add something,\nyou know, to the present you'll have to give Lucinda. Lucinda shall\nchoose something up to forty pounds.\" \"We'll say thirty,\" said\nLizzie, who was beginning to know the value of money. \"Split the\ndifference,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle, with a pleasant little burst of\nlaughter,--and the difference was split. That the very neat and\neven dandified appearance of the groom who rode out hunting with\nthem should be provided at the expense of Mrs. Carbuncle was quite\nunderstood; but it was equally well understood that Lizzie was to\nprovide the horse on which he rode, on every third day. It adds\ngreatly to the comfort of friends living together when these things\nare accurately settled.\n\nMr. Emilius remained longer than had been anticipated, and did not\ngo till Lord George and Sir Griffin took their departure. It was\nobserved that he never spoke of his wife; and yet Mrs. Carbuncle was\nalmost sure that she had heard of such a lady. He had made himself\nvery agreeable, and was, either by art or nature, a courteous\nman,--one who paid compliments to ladies. It was true, however,\nthat he sometimes startled his hearers by things which might have\nbeen considered to border on coarseness if they had not been said\nby a clergyman. Lizzie had an idea that he intended to marry Miss\nMacnulty. And Miss Macnulty certainly received his attentions with\npleasure. In these circumstances his prolonged stay at the castle was\nnot questioned;--but when towards the end of November Lord George and\nSir Griffin took their departure, he was obliged to return to his\nflock.\n\nOn the great subject of the diamonds Lizzie had spoken her\nmind freely to Mrs. Carbuncle early in the days of their\nfriendship,--immediately, that is, after the bargainings had been\ncompleted. \"Ten thousand pounds!\" ejaculated Mrs. Carbuncle, opening\nwide her eyes. Lizzie nodded her head thrice, in token of reiterated\nassurance. \"Do you mean that you really know their value?\" The ladies\nat this time were closeted together, and were discussing many things\nin the closest confidence.\n\n\"They were valued for me by jewellers.\"\n\n\"Ten thousand pounds! And Sir Florian gave them to you?\"\n\n\"Put them round my neck, and told me they were to be mine,--always.\"\n\n\"Generous man!\"\n\n\"Ah, if you had but known him!\" said Lizzie, just touching her eye\nwith her handkerchief.\n\n\"I daresay. And now the people claim them. I'm not a bit surprised at\nthat, my dear. I should have thought a man couldn't give away so much\nas that,--not just as one makes a present that costs forty or fifty\npounds.\" Mrs. Carbuncle could not resist the opportunity of showing\nthat she did not think so very much of that coming thirty-five-pound\n\"gift\" for which the bargain had been made.\n\n\"That's what they say. And they say ever so many other things\nbesides. They mean to prove that it's an--heirloom.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it is.\"\n\n\"But it isn't. My cousin Frank, who knows more about law than\nany other man in London, says that they can't make a necklace an\nheirloom. If it was a brooch or a ring it would be different. I don't\nquite understand it, but it is so.\"\n\n\"It's a pity Sir Florian didn't say something about it in his will,\"\nsuggested Mrs. Carbuncle.\n\n\"But he did;--at least, not just about the necklace.\" Then Lady\nEustace explained the nature of her late husband's will, as far as it\nregarded chattels to be found in the Castle of Portray at the time of\nhis death; and added the fiction, which had now become common to her,\nas to the necklace having been given to her in Scotland.\n\n\"I shouldn't let them have it,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle.\n\n\"I don't mean,\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"I should--sell them,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle.\n\n\"But why?\"\n\n\"Because there are so many accidents. A woman should be very rich\nindeed before she allows herself to walk about with ten thousand\npounds upon her shoulders. Suppose somebody broke into the house\nand stole them. And if they were sold, my dear, so that some got to\nParis, and others to St. Petersburg, and others to New York, they'd\nhave to give it up then.\" Before the discussion was over, Lizzie\ntripped up-stairs and brought the necklace down, and put it on Mrs.\nCarbuncle's neck. \"I shouldn't like to have such property in my\nhouse, my dear,\" continued Mrs. Carbuncle. \"Of course, diamonds are\nvery nice. Nothing is so nice. And if a person had a proper place to\nkeep them, and all that--\"\n\n\"I've a very strong iron case,\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"But they should be at the bank, or at the jewellers, or somewhere\nquite--quite safe. People might steal the case and all. If I were\nyou, I should sell them.\" It was explained to Mrs. Carbuncle on that\noccasion that Lizzie had brought them down with her in the train from\nLondon, and that she intended to take them back in the same way.\n\"There's nothing the thieves would find easier than to steal them on\nthe way,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle.\n\nIt was some days after this that there came down to her by post some\nterribly frightful documents, which were the first results, as far\nas she was concerned, of the filing of a bill in Chancery;--which\nhostile proceeding was, in truth, effected by the unaided energy of\nMr. Camperdown, although Mr. Camperdown put himself forward simply as\nan instrument used by the trustees of the Eustace property. Within\neight days she was to enter an appearance, or go through some\npreliminary ceremony towards showing why she should not surrender\nher diamonds to the Lord Chancellor, or to one of those satraps of\nhis, the Vice-Chancellors, or to some other terrible myrmidon. Mr.\nCamperdown in his letter explained that the service of this document\nupon her in Scotland would amount to nothing,--even were he to send\nit down by a messenger; but that, no doubt, she would send it to\nher attorney, who would see the expedience of avoiding exposure\nby accepting the service. Of all which explanation Lizzie did not\nunderstand one word. Messrs. Camperdowns' letter and the document\nwhich it contained did frighten her considerably, although the matter\nhad been discussed so often that she had accustomed herself to\ndeclare that no such bugbears as that should have any influence on\nher. She had asked Frank whether, in the event of such missiles\nreaching her, she might send them to him. He had told her that\nthey should be at once placed in the hands of her attorney;--and\nconsequently she now sent them to Messrs. Mowbray and Mopus, with a\nvery short note from herself. \"Lady Eustace presents her compliments\nto Messrs. Mowbray and Mopus, and encloses some papers she has\nreceived about her diamonds. They are her own diamonds, given to her\nby her late husband. Please do what is proper, but Mr. Camperdown\nought to be made to pay all the expenses.\"\n\nShe had, no doubt, allowed herself to hope that no further\nsteps would be taken in the matter; and the very name of the\nVice-Chancellor did for a few hours chill the blood at her heart. In\nthose few hours she almost longed to throw the necklace into the sea,\nfeeling sure that, if the diamonds were absolutely lost, there must\nbe altogether an end of the matter. But, by degrees, her courage\nreturned to her, as she remembered that her cousin had told her that,\nas far as he could see, the necklace was legally her own. Her cousin\nhad, of course, been deceived by the lies which she had repeated\nto him; but lies which had been efficacious with him might be\nefficacious with others. Who could prove that Sir Florian had not\ntaken the diamonds to Scotland, and given them to her there, in that\nvery house which was now her own?\n\nShe told Mrs. Carbuncle of the missiles which had been hurled at her\nfrom the London courts of law, and Mrs. Carbuncle evidently thought\nthat the diamonds were as good as gone. \"Then I suppose you can't\nsell them?\" said she.\n\n\"Yes, I could;--I could sell them to-morrow. What is to hinder me?\nSuppose I took them to jewellers in Paris?\"\n\n\"The jewellers would think you had stolen them.\"\n\n\"I didn't steal them,\" said Lizzie; \"they're my very own. Frank says\nthat nobody can take them away from me. Why shouldn't a man give his\nwife a diamond necklace as well as a diamond ring? That's what I\ncan't understand. What may he give her so that men sha'n't come and\nworry her life out of her in this way? As for an heirloom, anybody\nwho knows anything, knows that it can't be an heirloom. A pot or\na pan may be an heirloom;--but a diamond necklace cannot be an\nheirloom. Everybody knows that, that knows anything.\"\n\n\"I daresay it will all come right,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle, who did not\nin the least believe Lizzie's law about the pot and pan.\n\nIn the first week in January Lord George and Sir Griffin returned to\nthe castle with the view of travelling up to London with the three\nladies. This arrangement was partly thrown over by circumstances, as\nSir Griffin was pleased to leave Portray two days before the others\nand to travel by himself. There was a bitter quarrel between Lucinda\nand her lover, and it was understood afterwards by Lady Eustace that\nSir Griffin had had a few words with Lord George;--but what those few\nwords were, she never quite knew. There was no open rupture between\nthe two gentlemen, but Sir Griffin showed his displeasure to the\nladies, who were more likely to bear patiently his ill-humour in the\npresent circumstances than was Lord George. When a man has shown\nhimself to be so far amenable to feminine authority as to have put\nhimself in the way of matrimony, ladies will bear a great deal from\nhim. There was nothing which Mrs. Carbuncle would not endure from Sir\nGriffin,--just at present; and, on behalf of Mrs. Carbuncle, even\nLizzie was long-suffering. It cannot, however, be said that this\nPetruchio had as yet tamed his own peculiar shrew. Lucinda was as\nsavage as ever, and would snap and snarl, and almost bite. Sir\nGriffin would snarl too, and say very bearish things. But when it\ncame to the point of actual quarrelling, he would become sullen, and\nin his sullenness would yield.\n\n\"I don't see why Carruthers should have it all his own way,\" he said,\none hunting morning, to Lucinda.\n\n\"I don't care twopence who have their way,\" said Lucinda, \"I mean to\nhave mine;--that's all.\"\n\n\"I'm not speaking about you. I call it downright interference on his\npart. And I do think you give way to him. You never do anything that\nI suggest.\"\n\n\"You never suggest anything that I like to do,\" said Lucinda.\n\n\"That's a pity,\" said Sir Griffin, \"considering that I shall have to\nsuggest so many things that you will have to do.\"\n\n\"I don't know that at all,\" said Lucinda.\n\nMrs. Carbuncle came up during the quarrel, meaning to throw oil upon\nthe waters. \"What children you are!\" she said laughing. \"As if each\nof you won't have to do what the other suggests.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Carbuncle,\" began Sir Griffin, \"if you will have the great\nkindness not to endeavour to teach me what my conduct should be now\nor at any future time, I shall take it as a kindness.\"\n\n\"Sir Griffin, pray don't quarrel with Mrs. Carbuncle,\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"Lady Eustace, if Mrs. Carbuncle interferes with me, I shall quarrel\nwith her. I have borne a great deal more of this kind of thing than\nI like. I'm not going to be told this and told that because Mrs.\nCarbuncle happens to be the aunt of the future Lady Tewett,--if it\nshould come to that. I'm not going to marry a whole family; and the\nless I have of this kind of thing the more likely it is that I shall\ncome up to scratch when the time is up.\"\n\nThen Lucinda rose and spoke. \"Sir Griffin Tewett,\" she said, \"there\nis not the slightest necessity that you should come up--'to scratch.'\nI wonder that I have not as yet been able to make you understand that\nif it will suit your convenience to break off our match, it will\nnot in the least interfere with mine. And let me tell you this, Sir\nGriffin,--that any repetition of your unkindness to my aunt will make\nme utterly refuse to see you again.\"\n\n\"Of course, you like her better than you do me.\"\n\n\"A great deal better,\" said Lucinda.\n\n\"If I stand that I'll be ----,\" said Sir Griffin, leaving the room.\nAnd he left the castle, sleeping that night at the inn at Kilmarnock.\nThe day, however, was passed in hunting; and though he said nothing\nto either of the three ladies, it was understood by them as they\nreturned to Portray that there was to be no quarrel. Lord George\nand Sir Griffin had discussed the matter, and Lord George took upon\nhimself to say that there was no quarrel. On the morning but one\nfollowing, there came a note from Sir Griffin to Lucinda,--just as\nthey were leaving home for their journey up to London,--in which Sir\nGriffin expressed his regret if he had said anything displeasing to\nMrs. Carbuncle.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV\n\nA Midnight Adventure\n\n\nSomething as to the jewels had been told to Lord George;--and this\nwas quite necessary, as Lord George intended to travel with the\nladies from Portray to London. Of course, he had heard of the\ndiamonds,--as who had not? He had heard too of Lord Fawn, and knew\nwhy it was that Lord Fawn had peremptorily refused to carry out his\nengagement. But, till he was told by Mrs. Carbuncle, he did not\nknow that the diamonds were then kept within the castle, nor did he\nunderstand that it would be part of his duty to guard them on their\nway back to London. \"They are worth ever so much; ain't they?\" he\nsaid to Mrs. Carbuncle, when she first gave him the information.\n\n\"Ten thousand pounds,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle, almost with awe.\n\n\"I don't believe a word of it,\" said Lord George.\n\n\"She says that they've been valued at that, since she's had them.\"\n\nLord George owned to himself that such a necklace was worth\nhaving,--as also, no doubt, were Portray Castle and the income\narising from the estate, even though they could be held in possession\nonly for a single life. Hitherto in his very chequered career he\nhad escaped the trammels of matrimony, and among his many modes of\nlife had hardly even suggested to himself the expediency of taking\na wife with a fortune, and then settling down for the future, if\nsubmissively, still comfortably. To say that he had never looked\nforward to such a marriage as a possible future arrangement would\nprobably be incorrect. To men such as Lord George it is too easy a\nresult of a career to be altogether banished from the mind. But no\nattempt had ever yet been made, nor had any special lady ever been\nso far honoured in his thoughts as to be connected in them with any\nvague ideas which he might have formed on the subject. But now it did\noccur to him that Portray Castle was a place in which he could pass\ntwo or three months annually without ennui; and that if he were to\nmarry, little Lizzie Eustace would do as well as any other woman\nwith money whom he might chance to meet. He did not say all this to\nanybody, and therefore cannot be accused of vanity. He was the last\nman in the world to speak on such a subject to any one. And as our\nLizzie certainly bestowed upon him many of her smiles, much of her\npoetry, and some of her confidence, it cannot be said that he was not\njustified in his views. But then she was such \"an infernal little\nliar.\" Lord George was quite able to discover so much of her.\n\n\"She does lie, certainly,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle, \"but then who\ndoesn't?\"\n\nOn the morning of their departure the box with the diamonds was\nbrought down into the hall just as they were about to depart. The\ntall London footman again brought it down, and deposited it on one of\nthe oak hall-chairs, as though it were a thing so heavy that he could\nhardly stagger along with it. How Lizzie did hate the man as she\nwatched him, and regret that she had not attempted to carry it down\nherself. She had been with her diamonds that morning, and had seen\nthem out of the box and into it. Few days passed on which she did\nnot handle them and gaze at them. Mrs. Carbuncle had suggested that\nthe box, with all her diamonds in it, might be stolen from her,--and\nas she thought of this her heart almost sank within her. When she\nhad them once again in London she would take some steps to relieve\nherself from this embarrassment of carrying about with her so great a\nburthen of care. The man, with a vehement show of exertion, deposited\nthe box on a chair, and then groaned aloud. Lizzie knew very well\nthat she could lift the box by her own unaided exertions, and that\nthe groan was at any rate unnecessary.\n\n\"Supposing somebody were to steal that on the way,\" said Lord George\nto her, not in his pleasantest tone.\n\n\"Do not suggest anything so horrible,\" said Lizzie, trying to laugh.\n\n\"I shouldn't like it at all,\" said Lord George.\n\n\"I don't think it would make me a bit unhappy. You've heard about it\nall. There never was such a persecution. I often say that I should be\nwell pleased to take the bauble and fling it into the ocean waves.\"\n\n\"I should like to be a mermaid and catch it,\" said Lord George.\n\n\"And what better would you be? Such things are all vanity and\nvexation of spirit. I hate the shining thing.\" And she hit the box\nwith the whip she held in her hand.\n\nIt had been arranged that the party should sleep at Carlisle. It\nconsisted of Lord George, the three ladies, the tall man servant,\nLord George's own man, and the two maids. Miss Macnulty, with the\nheir and the nurses, were to remain at Portray for yet a while\nlonger. The iron box was again put into the carriage, and was used by\nLizzie as a footstool. This might have been very well, had there been\nno necessity for changing their train. At Troon the porter behaved\nwell, and did not struggle much as he carried it from the carriage\non to the platform. But at Kilmarnock, where they met the train\nfrom Glasgow, the big footman interfered again, and the scene was\nperformed under the eyes of a crowd of people. It seemed to Lizzie\nthat Lord George almost encouraged the struggling, as though he were\nin league with the footman to annoy her. But there was no further\nchange between Kilmarnock and Carlisle, and they managed to make\nthemselves very comfortable. Lunch had been provided;--for Mrs.\nCarbuncle was a woman who cared for such things, and Lord George also\nliked a glass of champagne in the middle of the day. Lizzie professed\nto be perfectly indifferent on such matters; but nevertheless she\nenjoyed her lunch, and allowed Lord George to press upon her a\nsecond, and perhaps a portion of a third glass of wine. Even Lucinda\nwas roused up from her general state of apathy, and permitted herself\nto forget Sir Griffin for a while.\n\nDuring this journey to Carlisle Lizzie Eustace almost made up her\nmind that Lord George was the very Corsair she had been expecting\never since she had mastered Lord Byron's great poem. He had a way\nof doing things and of saying things, of proclaiming himself to be\nmaster, and at the same time of making himself thoroughly agreeable\nto his dependants,--and especially to the one dependant whom he most\nhonoured at the time,--which exactly suited Lizzie's ideas of what a\nman should be. And then he possessed that utter indifference to all\nconventions and laws, which is the great prerogative of Corsairs. He\nhad no reverence for aught divine or human,--which is a great thing.\nThe Queen and Parliament, the bench of bishops, and even the police,\nwere to him just so many fungi and parasites, and noxious vapours,\nand false hypocrites. Such were the names by which he ventured to\ncall these bugbears of the world. It was so delightful to live with a\nman who himself had a title of his own, but who could speak of dukes\nand marquises as being quite despicable by reason of their absurd\nposition. And as they became gay and free after their luncheon he\nexpressed almost as much contempt for honesty as for dukes, and\nshowed clearly that he regarded matrimony and marquises to be equally\nvain and useless. \"How dare you say such things in our hearing!\"\nexclaimed Mrs. Carbuncle.\n\n\"I assert that if men and women were really true, no vows would be\nneeded;--and if no vows, then no marriage vows. Do you believe such\nvows are kept?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle enthusiastically.\n\n\"I don't,\" said Lucinda.\n\n\"Nor I,\" said the Corsair. \"Who can believe that a woman will always\nlove her husband because she swears she will? The oath is false on\nthe face of it.\"\n\n\"But women must marry,\" said Lizzie. The Corsair declared freely that\nhe did not see any such necessity.\n\nAnd then, though it could hardly be said that this Corsair was a\nhandsome man, still he had fine Corsair's eyes, full of expression\nand determination, eyes that could look love and bloodshed almost\nat the same time; and then he had those manly properties,--power,\nbigness, and apparent boldness,--which belong to a Corsair. To\nbe hurried about the world by such a man, treated sometimes with\ncrushing severity, and at others with the tenderest love, not to be\nspoken to for one fortnight, and then to be embraced perpetually for\nanother, to be cast every now and then into some abyss of despair\nby his rashness, and then raised to a pinnacle of human joy by his\ncourage,--that, thought Lizzie, would be the kind of life which would\nsuit her poetical temperament. But then, how would it be with her, if\nthe Corsair were to take to hurrying about the world without carrying\nher with him;--and were to do so always at her expense! Perhaps he\nmight hurry about the world and take somebody else with him. Medora,\nif Lizzie remembered rightly, had had no jointure or private fortune.\nBut yet a woman must risk something if the spirit of poetry is to\nbe allowed any play at all! \"And now these weary diamonds again,\"\nsaid Lord George, as the carriage was stopped against the Carlisle\nplatform. \"I suppose they must go into your bedroom, Lady Eustace?\"\n\n\"I wish you'd let the man put the box in yours;--just for this\nnight,\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"No;--not if I know it,\" said Lord George. And then he explained.\nSuch property would be quite as liable to be stolen when in his\ncustody as it would in hers;--but if stolen while in his would entail\nupon him a grievous vexation which would by no means lessen the\neffect of her loss. She did not understand him, but finding that he\nwas quite in earnest she directed that the box should be again taken\nto her own chamber. Lord George suggested that it should be entrusted\nto the landlord; and for a moment or two Lizzie submitted to the\nidea. But she stood for that moment thinking of it, and then decided\nthat the box should go to her own room. \"There's no knowing what that\nMr. Camperdown mightn't do,\" she whispered to Lord George. The porter\nand the tall footman, between them, staggered along under their load,\nand the iron box was again deposited in the bedroom of the Carlisle\ninn.\n\nThe evening at Carlisle was spent very pleasantly. The ladies agreed\nthat they would not dress,--but of course they did so with more or\nless of care. Lizzie made herself to look very pretty, though the\nskirt of the gown in which she came down was that which she had worn\nduring the journey. Pointing this out with much triumph, she accused\nMrs. Carbuncle and Lucinda of great treachery, in that they had not\nadhered to any vestige of their travelling raiment. But the rancour\nwas not vehement, and the evening was passed pleasantly. Lord George\nwas infinitely petted by the three Houris around him, and Lizzie\ncalled him a Corsair to his face. \"And you are the Medora,\" said Mrs.\nCarbuncle.\n\n\"Oh no. That is your place,--certainly,\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"What a pity Sir Griffin isn't here,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle, \"that we\nmight call him the Giaour.\" Lucinda shuddered, without any attempt at\nconcealing her shudder. \"That's all very well, Lucinda, but I think\nSir Griffin would make a very good Giaour.\"\n\n\"Pray don't, aunt. Let one forget it all just for a moment.\"\n\n\"I wonder what Sir Griffin would say if he was to hear this!\" said\nLord George.\n\nLate in the evening Lord George strolled out, and of course the\nladies discussed his character in his absence. Mrs. Carbuncle\ndeclared that he was the soul of honour. In regard to her own feeling\nfor him, she averred that no woman had ever had a truer friend. Any\nother sentiment was of course out of the question,--for was she not\na married woman? Had it not been for that accident, Mrs. Carbuncle\nreally thought that she could have given her heart to Lord George.\nLucinda declared that she always regarded him as a kind of\nsupplementary father. \"I suppose he is a year or two older than\nSir Griffin,\" said Lizzie. \"Lady Eustace, why should you make me\nunhappy?\" said Lucinda. Then Mrs. Carbuncle explained, that whereas\nSir Griffin was not yet thirty, Lord George was over forty. \"All I\ncan say is, he doesn't look it,\" urged Lady Eustace enthusiastically.\n\"Those sort of men never do,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle. Lord George, when\nhe returned, was greeted with an allusion to angels' wings,--and\nwould have been a good deal spoilt among them were it in the nature\nof such an article to receive injury. As soon as the clock had struck\nten the ladies all went away to their beds.\n\nLizzie, when she was in her own room, of course found her maid\nwaiting for her. It was necessarily part of the religion of such a\nwoman as Lizzie Eustace that she could not go to bed, or change her\nclothes, or get up in the morning, without the assistance of her\nown young woman. She would not like to have it thought that she\ncould stick a pin into her own belongings without such assistance.\nNevertheless it was often the case with her, that she was anxious to\nget rid of her girl's attendance. It had been so on this morning, and\nbefore dinner, and was so now again. She was secret in her movements,\nand always had some recess in her boxes and bags and dressing\napparatuses to which she did not choose that Miss Patience Crabstick\nshould have access. She was careful about her letters, and very\ncareful about her money. And then as to that iron box in which the\ndiamonds were kept! Patience Crabstick had never yet seen the inside\nof it. Moreover, it may be said,--either on Lizzie's behalf or to her\ndiscredit, as the reader may be pleased to take it,--that she was\nquite able to dress herself, to brush her own hair, to take off her\nown clothes; and that she was not, either by nature or education, an\nincapable young woman. But that honour and glory demanded it, she\nwould almost as lief have had no Patience Crabstick to pry into her\nmost private matters. All which Crabstick knew, and would often\ndeclare her missus to be \"of all missuses the most slyest and least\ncome-at-able.\" On this present night she was very soon despatched to\nher own chamber. Lizzie, however, took one careful look at the iron\nbox before the girl was sent away.\n\nCrabstick, on this occasion, had not far to go to seek her own couch.\nAlongside of Lizzie's larger chamber there was a small room,--a\ndressing-room with a bed in it, which, for this night, was devoted to\nCrabstick's accommodation. Of course, she departed from attendance\non her mistress by the door which opened from the one room to the\nother; but this had no sooner been closed than Crabstick descended to\ncomplete the amusements of the evening. Lizzie, when she was alone,\nbolted both the doors on the inside, and then quickly retired to\nrest. Some short prayer she said, with her knees close to the iron\nbox. Then she put certain articles of property under her pillow,--her\nwatch and chain, and the rings from her fingers, and a packet which\nshe had drawn from her travelling-desk,--and was soon in bed,\nthinking that, as she fell away to sleep, she would revolve in her\nmind that question of the Corsair;--would it be good to trust herself\nand all her belongings to one who might perhaps take her belongings\naway, but leave herself behind? The subject was not unpleasant, and\nwhile she was considering it, she fell asleep.\n\nIt was, perhaps, about two in the morning when a man, very efficient\nat the trade which he was then following, knelt outside Lady\nEustace's door, and, with a delicately-made saw, aided, probably,\nby some other equally well-finished tools, absolutely cut out that\nportion of the bedroom door on which the bolt was fastened. He must\nhave known the spot exactly, for he did not doubt a moment as he\ncommenced his work; and yet there was nothing on the exterior of the\ndoor to show where the bolt was placed. The bit was cut out without\nthe slightest noise, and then, when the door was opened, was placed,\njust inside, upon the floor. The man then with perfectly noiseless\nstep entered the room, knelt again,--just where poor Lizzie had knelt\nas she said her prayers,--so that he might the more easily raise the\niron box without a struggle, and left the room with it in his arms\nwithout disturbing the lovely sleeper. He then descended the stairs,\npassed into the coffee-room at the bottom of them, and handed the box\nthrough an open window to a man who was crouching on the outside in\nthe dark. He then followed the box, pulled down the window, put on a\npair of boots which his friend had ready for him; and the two, after\nlingering a few moments in the shade of the dark wall, retreated with\ntheir prize round a corner. The night itself was almost pitch-dark,\nand very wet. It was as nearly black with darkness as a night can\nbe. So far, the enterprising adventurers had been successful, and we\nwill now leave them in their chosen retreat, engaged on the longer\noperation of forcing open the iron safe. For it had been arranged\nbetween them that the iron safe should be opened then and there.\nThough the weight to him who had taken it out of Lizzie's room had\nnot been oppressive, as it had oppressed the tall serving-man, it\nmight still have been an encumbrance to gentlemen intending to\ntravel by railway with as little observation as possible. They were,\nhowever, well supplied with tools, and we will leave them at their\nwork.\n\nOn the next morning Lizzie was awakened earlier than she had\nexpected, and found, not only Patience Crabstick in her bedroom, but\nalso a chambermaid, and the wife of the manager of the hotel. The\nstory was soon told to her. Her room had been broken open, and her\ntreasure was gone. The party had intended to breakfast at their\nleisure, and proceed to London by a train leaving Carlisle in the\nmiddle of the day; but they were soon disturbed from their rest. Lady\nEustace had hardly time to get her slippers on her feet, and to wrap\nherself in her dressing-gown, to get rid of her dishevelled nightcap,\nand make herself just fit for public view, before the manager of the\nhotel, and Lord George, and the tall footman, and the boots were\nin her bedroom. It was too plainly manifest to them all that the\ndiamonds were gone. The superintendent of the Carlisle police was\nthere almost as soon as the others;--and following him very quickly\ncame the important gentleman who was the head of the constabulary of\nthe county.\n\nLizzie, when she first heard the news, was awe-struck, rather than\noutwardly demonstrative of grief. \"There has been a regular plot,\"\nsaid Lord George. Captain Fitzmaurice, the gallant chief, nodded his\nhead. \"Plot enough,\" said the superintendent,--who did not mean to\nconfide his thoughts to any man, or to exempt any human being from\nhis suspicion. The manager of the hotel was very angry, and at first\ndid not restrain his anger. Did not everybody know that if articles\nof value were brought into an hotel they should be handed over to the\nsafe-keeping of the manager? He almost seemed to think that Lizzie\nhad stolen her own box of diamonds. \"My dear fellow,\" said Lord\nGeorge, \"nobody is saying a word against you, or your house.\"\n\n\"No, my lord;--but--\"\n\n\"Lady Eustace is not blaming you, and do not you blame anybody else,\"\nsaid Lord George. \"Let the police do what is right.\"\n\nAt last the men retreated, and Lizzie was left with Patience and Mrs.\nCarbuncle. But even then she did not give way to her grief, but sat\nupon the bed awe-struck and mute. \"Perhaps I had better get dressed,\"\nshe said at last.\n\n\"I feared how it might be,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle, holding Lizzie's\nhand affectionately.\n\n\"Yes;--you said so.\"\n\n\"The prize was so great.\"\n\n\"I always was a-telling my lady--\" began Crabstick.\n\n\"Hold your tongue!\" said Lizzie angrily. \"I suppose the police will\ndo the best they can, Mrs. Carbuncle?\"\n\n\"Oh yes;--and so will Lord George.\"\n\n\"I think I'll lie down again for a little while,\" said Lizzie. \"I\nfeel so sick I hardly know what to do. If I were to lie down for a\nlittle I should be better.\" With much difficulty she got them to\nleave her. Then, before she again undressed herself, she bolted the\ndoor that still had a bolt, and turned the lock in the other. Having\ndone this, she took out from under her pillow the little parcel which\nhad been in her desk,--and, untying it, perceived that her dear\ndiamond necklace was perfect, and quite safe.\n\nThe enterprising adventurers had, indeed, stolen the iron case,\nbut they had stolen nothing else. The reader must not suppose\nthat because Lizzie had preserved her jewels, she was therefore a\nconsenting party to the abstraction of the box. The theft had been\na genuine theft, planned with great skill, carried out with much\ningenuity, one in the perpetration of which money had been spent,--a\ntheft which for a while baffled the police of England, and which was\nsupposed to be very creditable to those who had been engaged in it.\nBut the box, and nothing but the box, had fallen into the hands of\nthe thieves.\n\nLizzie's silence when the abstraction of the box was made known to\nher,--her silence as to the fact that the necklace was at that moment\nwithin the grasp of her own fingers,--was not at first the effect\nof deliberate fraud. She was ashamed to tell them that she brought\nthe box empty from Portray, having the diamonds in her own keeping\nbecause she had feared that the box might be stolen. And then it\noccurred to her, quick as thought could flash, that it might be well\nthat Mr. Camperdown should be made to believe that they had been\nstolen. And so she kept her secret. The reflections of the next\nhalf-hour told her how very great would now be her difficulties.\nBut, as she had not disclosed the truth at first, she could hardly\ndisclose it now.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLV\n\nThe Journey to London\n\n\nWhen we left Lady Eustace alone in her bedroom at the Carlisle hotel\nafter the discovery of the robbery, she had very many cares upon her\nmind. The necklace was, indeed, safe under her pillow in the bed;\nbut when all the people were around her,--her own friends, and the\npolice, and they who were concerned with the inn,--she had not told\nthem that it was so, but had allowed them to leave her with the\nbelief that the diamonds had gone with the box. Even at this moment,\nas she knew well, steps were being taken to discover the thieves, and\nto make public the circumstances of the robbery. Already, no doubt,\nthe fact that her chamber had been entered in the night, and her\njewel-box withdrawn, was known to the London police officers. In such\ncircumstances how could she now tell the truth? But it might be that\nalready had the thieves been taken. In that case would not the truth\nbe known, even though she should not tell it? Then she thought for a\nwhile that she would get rid of the diamonds altogether, so that no\none should know aught of them. If she could only think of a place fit\nfor such purpose she would so hide them that no human ingenuity could\ndiscover them. Let the thieves say what they might, her word would,\nin such case, be better than that of the thieves. She would declare\nthat the jewels had been in the box when the box was taken. The\nthieves would swear that the box had been empty. She would appeal\nto the absence of the diamonds, and the thieves,--who would be\nknown as thieves,--would be supposed, even by their own friends\nand associates, to have disposed of the diamonds before they had\nbeen taken. There would be a mystery in all this, and a cunning\ncleverness, the idea of which had in itself a certain charm\nfor Lizzie Eustace. She would have all the world at a loss. Mr.\nCamperdown could do nothing further to harass her; and would have\nbeen, so far, overcome. She would be saved from the feeling of public\ndefeat in the affair of the necklace, which would be very dreadful\nto her. Lord Fawn might probably be again at her feet. And in all\nthe fuss and rumour which such an affair would make in London, there\nwould be nothing of which she need be ashamed. She liked the idea,\nand she had grown to be very sick of the necklace.\n\nBut what should she do with it? It was, at this moment, between her\nfingers beneath the pillow. If she were minded,--and she thought she\nwas so minded,--to get rid of it altogether, the sea would be the\nplace. Could she make up her mind absolutely to destroy so large\na property, it would be best for her to have recourse to \"her own\nbroad waves,\" as she called them even to herself. It was within the\n\"friendly depths of her own rock-girt ocean\" that she should find a\ngrave for her great trouble. But now her back was to the sea, and\nshe could hardly insist on returning to Portray without exciting a\nsuspicion that might be fatal to her.\n\nAnd then might it not be possible to get altogether quit of the\ndiamonds and yet to retain the power of future possession? She knew\nthat she was running into debt, and that money would, some day, be\nmuch needed. Her acquaintance with Mr. Benjamin, the jeweller, was\na fact often present to her mind. She might not be able to get ten\nthousand pounds from Mr. Benjamin;--but if she could get eight, or\nsix, or even five, how pleasant would it be! If she could put away\nthe diamonds for three or four years,--if she could so hide them\nthat no human eyes could see them till she should again produce them\nto the light,--surely, after so long an interval, they might be\nmade available! But where should be found such hiding-place? She\nunderstood well how great was the peril while the necklace was in\nher own immediate keeping. Any accident might discover it, and if\nthe slightest suspicion were aroused, the police would come upon her\nwith violence and discover it. But surely there must be some such\nhiding-place,--if only she could think of it! Then her mind reverted\nto all the stories she had ever heard of mysterious villanies. There\nmust be some way of accomplishing this thing, if she could only\nbring her mind to work upon it exclusively. A hole dug deep into the\nground;--would not that be the place? But then, where should the hole\nbe dug? In what spot should she trust the earth? If anywhere, it\nmust be at Portray. But now she was going from Portray to London. It\nseemed to her to be certain that she could dig no hole in London that\nwould be secret to herself. Nor could she trust herself, during the\nhour or two that remained to her, to find such a hole in Carlisle.\n\nWhat she wanted was a friend;--some one that she could trust. But she\nhad no such friend. She could not dare to give the jewels up to Lord\nGeorge. So tempted, would not any Corsair appropriate the treasure?\nAnd if, as might be possible, she were mistaken about him and he was\nno Corsair, then would he betray her to the police? She thought of\nall her dearest friends,--Frank Greystock, Mrs. Carbuncle, Lucinda,\nMiss Macnulty,--even of Patience Crabstick,--but there was no friend\nwhom she could trust. Whatever she did she must do alone! She began\nto fear that the load of thought required would be more than she\ncould bear. One thing, however, was certain to her;--she could not\nnow venture to tell them all that the necklace was in her possession,\nand that the stolen box had been empty.\n\nThinking of all this, she went to sleep,--still holding the packet\ntight between her fingers,--and in this position was awakened at\nabout ten by a knock at the door from her friend Mrs. Carbuncle.\nLizzie jumped out of bed, and admitted her friend, admitting also\nPatience Crabstick. \"You had better get up now, dear,\" said Mrs.\nCarbuncle. \"We are all going to breakfast.\" Lizzie declared herself\nto be so fluttered, that she must have her breakfast up-stairs. No\none was to wait for her. Crabstick would go down and fetch for her\na cup of tea,--and just a morsel of something to eat. \"You can't be\nsurprised that I shouldn't be quite myself,\" said Lizzie.\n\nMrs. Carbuncle's surprise did not run at all in that direction. Both\nMrs. Carbuncle and Lord George had been astonished to find how well\nshe bore her loss. Lord George gave her credit for real bravery. Mrs.\nCarbuncle suggested, in a whisper, that perhaps she regarded the\ntheft as an easy way out of a lawsuit. \"I suppose you know, George,\nthey would have got it from her.\" Then Lord George whistled, and, in\nanother whisper, declared that, if the little adventure had all been\narranged by Lady Eustace herself with the view of getting the better\nof Mr. Camperdown, his respect for that lady would be very greatly\nraised. \"If,\" said Lord George, \"it turns out that she has had a\ncouple of bravos in her pay, like an old Italian marquis, I shall\nthink very highly of her indeed.\" This had occurred before Mrs.\nCarbuncle came up to Lizzie's room;--but neither of them for a moment\nsuspected that the necklace was still within the hotel.\n\nThe box had been found, and a portion of the fragments were brought\ninto the room while the party were still at breakfast. Lizzie was not\nin the room, but the news was at once taken up to her by Crabstick,\ntogether with a pheasant's wing and some buttered toast. In a recess\nbeneath an archway running under the railroad, not distant from the\nhotel above a hundred and fifty yards, the iron box had been found.\nIt had been forced open, so said the sergeant of police, with tools\nof the finest steel, peculiarly made for such purpose. The sergeant\nof police was quite sure that the thing had been done by London men\nwho were at the very top of their trade. It was manifest that nothing\nhad been spared. Every motion of the party must have been known to\nthem, and probably one of the adventurers had travelled in the same\ntrain with them. And the very doors of the bedroom in the hotel had\nbeen measured by the man who had cut out the bolt. The sergeant of\npolice was almost lost in admiration;--but the superintendent of\npolice, whom Lord George saw more than once, was discreet and silent.\nTo the superintendent of police it was by no means sure that Lord\nGeorge himself might not be fond of diamonds. Of a suspicion flying\nso delightfully high as this, he breathed no word to any one; but\nsimply suggested that he should like to retain the companionship of\none of the party. If Lady Eustace could dispense with the services of\nthe tall footman, the tall footman might be found useful at Carlisle.\nIt was arranged, therefore, that the tall footman should remain;--and\nthe tall footman did remain, though not with his own consent.\n\nThe whole party, including Lady Eustace herself and Patience\nCrabstick, were called upon to give their evidence to the Carlisle\nmagistrates before they could proceed to London. This Lizzie did,\nhaving the necklace at that moment locked up in her desk at the inn.\nThe diamonds were supposed to be worth ten thousand pounds. There\nwas to be a lawsuit about them. She did not for a moment doubt that\nthey were her property. She had been very careful about the diamonds\nbecause of the lawsuit. Fearing that Mr. Camperdown might wrest them\nfrom her possession, she had caused the iron box to be made. She\nhad last seen the diamonds on the evening before her departure from\nPortray. She had then herself locked them up, and she now produced\nthe key. The lock was still so far uninjured that the key would turn\nit. That was her evidence. Crabstick, with a good deal of reticence,\nsupported her mistress. She had seen the diamonds, no doubt, but had\nnot seen them often. She had seen them down at Portray, but not for\never so long. Crabstick had very little to say about them; but the\nclever superintendent was by no means sure that Crabstick did not\nknow more than she said. Mrs. Carbuncle and Lord George had also\nseen the diamonds at Portray. There was no doubt whatever as to the\ndiamonds having been in the iron box;--nor was there, said Lord\nGeorge, any doubt but that this special necklace had acquired so much\npublic notice from the fact of the threatened lawsuit, as might make\nits circumstances and value known to London thieves. The tall footman\nwas not examined, but was detained by the police under a remand given\nby the magistrates.\n\nMuch information as to what had been done oozed out in spite of the\nprecautions of the discreet superintendent. The wires had been put\ninto operation in every direction, and it had been discovered that\none man whom nobody knew had left the down mail train at Annan, and\nanother at Dumfries. These men had taken tickets by the train leaving\nCarlisle between four and five a.m., and were supposed to have been\nthe two thieves. It had been nearly seven before the theft had been\ndiscovered, and by that time not only had the men reached the towns\nnamed, but had had time to make their way back again or farther on\ninto Scotland. At any rate, for the present, all trace of them was\nlost. The sergeant of police did not doubt but that one of these men\nwas making his way up to London with the necklace in his pocket. This\nwas told to Lizzie by Lord George; and though she was awe-struck\nby the danger of her situation, she nevertheless did feel some\nsatisfaction in remembering that she and she only held the key of the\nmystery. And then as to those poor thieves! What must have been their\nconsternation when they found, after all the labour and perils of the\nnight, that the box contained no diamonds,--that the treasure was not\nthere, and that they were nevertheless bound to save themselves by\nflight and stratagem from the hands of the police! Lizzie, as she\nthought of this, almost pitied the poor thieves. What a consternation\nthere would be among the Camperdowns and Garnetts, among the Mopuses\nand Benjamins, when the news was heard in London! Lizzie almost\nenjoyed it. As her mind went on making fresh schemes on the subject,\na morbid desire of increasing the mystery took possession of her.\nShe was quite sure that nobody knew her secret, and that nobody as\nyet could even guess it. There was great danger, but there might be\ndelight and even profit if she could safely dispose of the jewels\nbefore suspicion against herself should be aroused. She could\nunderstand that a rumour should get to the police that the box had\nbeen empty, even if the thieves were not taken;--but such rumour\nwould avail nothing if she could only dispose of the diamonds. As\nshe first thought of all this, the only plan hitherto suggested to\nherself would require her immediate return to Portray. If she were at\nPortray she could find a spot in which she could bury the necklace.\nBut she was obliged to allow herself now to be hurried up to London.\nWhen she got into the train the little parcel was in her desk, and\nthe key of her desk was fastened round her neck.\n\nThey had secured a compartment for themselves from Carlisle to\nLondon, and of course filled four seats. \"As I am alive,\" said\nLord George as soon as the train had left the station, \"that head\npoliceman thinks that I am the thief!\" Mrs. Carbuncle laughed.\nLizzie protested that this was absurd. Lucinda declared that such\na suspicion would be vastly amusing. \"It's a fact,\" continued Lord\nGeorge. \"I can see it in the fellow's eye, and I feel it to be a\ncompliment. They are so very 'cute that they delight in suspicions.\nI remember, when the altar-plate was stolen from Barchester Cathedral\nsome years ago, a splendid idea occurred to one of the police, that\nthe Bishop had taken it!\"\n\n\"Really?\" asked Lizzie.\n\n\"Oh, yes;--really. I don't doubt but that there is already a belief\nin some of their minds that you have stolen your own diamonds for the\nsake of getting the better of Mr. Camperdown.\"\n\n\"But what could I do with them if I had?\" asked Lizzie.\n\n\"Sell them, of course. There is always a market for such goods.\"\n\n\"But who would buy them?\"\n\n\"If you have been so clever, Lady Eustace, I'll find a purchaser for\nthem. One would have to go a good distance to do it,--and there would\nbe some expense. But the thing could be done. Vienna, I should think,\nwould be about the place.\"\n\n\"Very well, then,\" said Lizzie. \"You won't be surprised if I ask you\nto take the journey for me.\" Then they all laughed, and were very\nmuch amused. It was quite agreed among them that Lizzie bore her loss\nvery well.\n\n\"I shouldn't care the least for losing them,\" said Lizzie,--\"only\nthat Florian gave them to me. They have been such a vexation to me\nthat to be without them will be a comfort.\" Her desk had been brought\ninto the carriage and was now used as a foot-stool in place of the\nbox which was gone.\n\nThey arrived at Mrs. Carbuncle's house in Hertford Street quite\nlate, between ten and eleven;--but a note had been sent from Lizzie\nto her cousin Frank's address from the Euston Square station by a\ncommissionaire. Indeed, two notes were sent,--one to the House of\nCommons, and the other to the Grosvenor Hotel. \"My necklace has been\nstolen. Come to me early to-morrow at Mrs. Carbuncle's house, No. --,\nHertford Street.\" And he did come,--before Lizzie was up. Crabstick\nbrought her mistress word that Mr. Greystock was in the parlour soon\nafter nine o'clock. Lizzie again hurried on her clothes so that she\nmight see her cousin, taking care as she did so that though her\ntoilet might betray haste, it should not be other than charming. And\nas she dressed she endeavoured to come to some conclusion. Would it\nnot be best for her that she should tell everything to her cousin,\nand throw herself upon his mercy, trusting to his ingenuity to\nextricate her from her difficulties? She had been thinking of her\nposition almost through the entire night, and had remembered that at\nCarlisle she had committed perjury. She had sworn that the diamonds\nhad been left by her in the box. And should they be found with her it\nmight be that they would put her in gaol for stealing them. Little\nmercy could she expect from Mr. Camperdown should she fall into\nthat gentleman's hands! But Frank, if she would even yet tell him\neverything honestly, might probably save her.\n\n\"What is this about the diamonds?\" he asked as soon as he saw her.\nShe had flown almost into his arms as though carried there by the\nexcitement of the moment. \"You don't really mean that they have been\nstolen?\"\n\n\"I do, Frank.\"\n\n\"On the journey?\"\n\n\"Yes, Frank;--at the inn at Carlisle.\"\n\n\"Box and all?\" Then she told him the whole story;--not the true\nstory, but the story as it was believed by all the world. She found\nit to be impossible to tell him the true story. \"And the box was\nbroken open, and left in the street?\"\n\n\"Under an archway,\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"And what do the police think?\"\n\n\"I don't know what they think. Lord George says that they believe he\nis the thief.\"\n\n\"He knew of them,\" said Frank, as though he imagined that the\nsuggestion was not altogether absurd.\n\n\"Oh, yes;--he knew of them.\"\n\n\"And what is to be done?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I've sent for you to tell me.\" Then Frank averred that\ninformation should be immediately given to Mr. Camperdown. He would\nhimself call on Mr. Camperdown, and would also see the head of the\nLondon police. He did not doubt but that all the circumstances were\nalready known in London at the police office;--but it might be well\nthat he should see the officer. He was acquainted with the gentleman,\nand might perhaps learn something. Lizzie at once acceded, and Frank\nwent direct to Mr. Camperdown's offices. \"If I had lost ten thousand\npounds in that way,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle, \"I think I should have\nbroken my heart.\" Lizzie felt that her heart was bursting rather than\nbeing broken, because the ten thousand pounds' worth of diamonds was\nnot really lost.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVI\n\nLucy Morris in Brook Street\n\n\nLucy Morris went to Lady Linlithgow early in October, and was still\nwith Lady Linlithgow when Lizzie Eustace returned to London in\nJanuary. During these three months she certainly had not been happy.\nIn the first place, she had not once seen her lover. This had aroused\nno anger or suspicion in her bosom against him, because the old\ncountess had told her that she would have no lover come to the house,\nand that, above all, she would not allow a young man with whom she\nherself was connected to come in that guise to her companion. \"From\nall I hear,\" said Lady Linlithgow, \"it's not at all likely to be a\nmatch;--and at any rate it can't go on here.\" Lucy thought that she\nwould be doing no more than standing up properly for her lover by\nasserting her conviction that it would be a match;--and she did\nassert it bravely; but she made no petition for his presence, and\nbore that trouble bravely. In the next place, Frank was not a\nsatisfactory correspondent. He did write to her occasionally;--and he\nwrote also to the old countess immediately on his return to town from\nBobsborough a letter which was intended as an answer to that which\nshe had written to Mrs. Greystock. What was said in that letter Lucy\nnever knew;--but she did know that Frank's few letters to herself\nwere not full and hearty,--were not such thorough-going love-letters\nas lovers write to each other when they feel unlimited satisfaction\nin the work. She excused him,--telling herself that he was\noverworked, that with his double trade of legislator and lawyer he\ncould hardly be expected to write letters,--that men, in respect of\nletter-writing, are not as women are, and the like; but still there\ngrew at her heart a little weed of care, which from week to week\nspread its noxious, heavy-scented leaves, and robbed her of her\njoyousness. To be loved by her lover, and to feel that she was\nhis,--to have a lover of her own to whom she could thoroughly devote\nherself,--to be conscious that she was one of those happy women in\nthe world who find a mate worthy of worship as well as love,--this to\nher was so great a joy that even the sadness of her present position\ncould not utterly depress her. From day to day she assured herself\nthat she did not doubt and would not doubt,--that there was no cause\nfor doubt;--that she would herself be base were she to admit any\nshadow of suspicion. But yet his absence,--and the shortness of those\nlittle notes, which came perhaps once a fortnight, did tell upon\nher in opposition to her own convictions. Each note as it came was\nanswered,--instantly; but she would not write except when the notes\ncame. She would not seem to reproach him by writing oftener than he\nwrote. When he had given her so much, and she had nothing but her\nconfidence to give in return, would she stint him in that? There can\nbe no love, she said, without confidence, and it was the pride of her\nheart to love him.\n\nThe circumstances of her present life were desperately weary to her.\nShe could hardly understand why it was that Lady Linlithgow should\ndesire her presence. She was required to do nothing. She had no\nduties to perform, and, as it seemed to her, was of no use to any\none. The countess would not even allow her to be of ordinary service\nin the house. Lady Linlithgow, as she had said of herself, poked her\nown fires, carved her own meat, lit her own candles, opened and shut\nthe doors for herself, wrote her own letters,--and did not even like\nto have books read to her. She simply chose to have some one sitting\nwith her to whom she could speak and make little cross-grained,\nsarcastic, and ill-natured remarks. There was no company at the house\nin Brook Street, and when the countess herself went out, she went\nout alone. Even when she had a cab to go shopping, or to make calls,\nshe rarely asked Lucy to go with her,--and was benevolent chiefly\nin this,--that if Lucy chose to walk round the square, or as far\nas the park, her ladyship's maid was allowed to accompany her for\nprotection. Poor Lucy often told herself that such a life would be\nunbearable,--were it not for the supreme satisfaction she had in\nremembering her lover. And then the arrangement had been made only\nfor six months. She did not feel quite assured of her fate at the end\nof those six months, but she believed that there would come to her a\nresidence in a sort of outer garden to that sweet Elysium in which\nshe was to pass her life. The Elysium would be Frank's house; and the\nouter garden was the deanery at Bobsborough.\n\nTwice during the three months Lady Fawn, with two of the girls, came\nto call upon her. On the first occasion she was unluckily out, taking\nadvantage of the protection of her ladyship's maid in getting a\nlittle air. Lady Linlithgow had also been away, and Lady Fawn had\nseen no one. Afterwards, both Lucy and her ladyship were found at\nhome, and Lady Fawn was full of graciousness and affection. \"I\ndaresay you've got something to say to each other,\" said Lady\nLinlithgow, \"and I'll go away.\"\n\n\"Pray don't let us disturb you,\" said Lady Fawn.\n\n\"You'd only abuse me if I didn't,\" said Lady Linlithgow.\n\nAs soon as she was gone Lucy rushed into her friend's arms.\n\n\"It is so nice to see you again.\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear, isn't it? I did come before, you know.\"\n\n\"You have been so good to me! To see you again is like the violets\nand primroses.\" She was crouching close to Lady Fawn, with her hand\nin that of her friend Lydia. \"I haven't a word to say against Lady\nLinlithgow, but it is like winter here, after dear Richmond.\"\n\n\"Well;--we think we're prettier at Richmond,\" said Lady Fawn.\n\n\"There were such hundreds of things to do there,\" said Lucy. \"After\nall, what a comfort it is to have things to do.\"\n\n\"Why did you come away?\" said Lydia.\n\n\"Oh, I was obliged. You mustn't scold me now that you have come to\nsee me.\"\n\nThere were a hundred things to be said about Fawn Court and the\nchildren, and a hundred more things about Lady Linlithgow and Bruton\nStreet. Then, at last, Lady Fawn asked the one important question.\n\"And now, my dear, what about Mr. Greystock?\"\n\n\"Oh,--I don't know;--nothing particular, Lady Fawn. It's just as it\nwas, and I am--quite satisfied.\"\n\n\"You see him sometimes?\"\n\n\"No, never. I have not seen him since the last time he came down to\nRichmond. Lady Linlithgow doesn't allow--followers.\" There was a\npleasant little spark of laughter in Lucy's eye as she said this,\nwhich would have told to any bystander the whole story of the\naffection which existed between her and Lady Fawn.\n\n\"That's very ill-natured,\" said Lydia.\n\n\"And he's a sort of cousin, too,\" said Lady Fawn.\n\n\"That's just the reason why,\" said Lucy, explaining. \"Of course, Lady\nLinlithgow thinks that her sister's nephew can do better than marry\nher companion. It's a matter of course she should think so. What I am\nmost afraid of is that the dean and Mrs. Greystock should think so\ntoo.\"\n\nNo doubt the dean and Mrs. Greystock would think so;--Lady Fawn\nwas very sure of that. Lady Fawn was one of the best women\nbreathing,--unselfish, motherly, affectionate, appreciative, and\nnever happy unless she was doing good to somebody. It was her nature\nto be soft, and kind, and beneficent. But she knew very well that if\nshe had had a son,--a second son,--situated as was Frank Greystock,\nshe would not wish him to marry a girl without a penny, who was\nforced to earn her bread by being a governess. The sacrifice on Mr.\nGreystock's part would, in her estimation, be so great, that she did\nnot believe that it would be made. Woman-like, she regarded the man\nas being so much more important than the woman, that she could not\nthink that Frank Greystock would devote himself simply to such a\none as Lucy Morris. Had Lady Fawn been asked which was the better\ncreature of the two, her late governess or the rising barrister who\nhad declared himself to be that governess's lover, she would have\nsaid that no man could be better than Lucy. She knew Lucy's worth\nand goodness so well that she was ready herself to do any act of\nfriendship on behalf of one so sweet and excellent. For herself and\nher girls Lucy was a companion and friend in every way satisfactory.\nBut was it probable that a man of the world, such as was Frank\nGreystock, a rising man, a member of Parliament, one who, as\neverybody knew, was especially in want of money,--was it probable\nthat such a man as this would make her his wife just because she was\ngood, and worthy, and sweet-natured? No doubt the man had said that\nhe would do so,--and Lady Fawn's fears betrayed on her ladyship's\npart a very bad opinion of men in general. It may seem to be a\nparadox to assert that such bad opinion sprung from the high idea\nwhich she entertained of the importance of men in general;--but it\nwas so. She had but one son, and of all her children he was the least\nworthy; but he was more important to her than all her daughters.\nBetween her own girls and Lucy she hardly made any difference;--but\nwhen her son had chosen to quarrel with Lucy it had been necessary to\nsend Lucy to eat her meals up-stairs. She could not believe that Mr.\nGreystock should think so much of such a little girl as to marry her.\nMr. Greystock would no doubt behave very badly in not doing so;--but\nthen men do so often behave very badly! And at the bottom of her\nheart she almost thought that they might be excused for doing so.\nAccording to her view of things, a man out in the world had so many\nthings to think of, and was so very important, that he could hardly\nbe expected to act at all times with truth and sincerity.\n\nLucy had suggested that the dean and Mrs. Greystock would dislike the\nmarriage, and upon that hint Lady Fawn spoke. \"Nothing is settled, I\nsuppose, as to where you are to go when the six months are over?\"\n\n\"Nothing as yet, Lady Fawn.\"\n\n\"They haven't asked you to go to Bobsborough?\"\n\nLucy would have given the world not to blush as she answered, but she\ndid blush. \"Nothing is fixed, Lady Fawn.\"\n\n\"Something should be fixed, Lucy. It should be settled by this\ntime;--shouldn't it, dear? What will you do without a home, if at the\nend of the six months Lady Linlithgow should say that she doesn't\nwant you any more?\"\n\nLucy certainly did not look forward to a condition in which Lady\nLinlithgow should be the arbitress of her destiny. The idea of\nstaying with the countess was almost as bad to her as that of finding\nherself altogether homeless. She was still blushing, feeling herself\nto be hot and embarrassed. But Lady Fawn sat, waiting for an answer.\nTo Lucy there was only one answer possible. \"I will ask Mr. Greystock\nwhat I am to do.\" Lady Fawn shook her head. \"You don't believe in Mr.\nGreystock, Lady Fawn; but I do.\"\n\n\"My darling girl,\" said her ladyship, making the special speech for\nthe sake of making which she had travelled up from Richmond,--\"it is\nnot exactly a question of belief, but one of common prudence. No girl\nshould allow herself to depend on a man before she is married to him.\nBy doing so she will be apt to lose even his respect.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean for money,\" said Lucy, hotter than ever, with her eyes\nfull of tears.\n\n\"She should not be in any respect at his disposal till he has bound\nhimself to her at the altar. You may believe me, Lucy, when I tell\nyou so. It is only because I love you so that I say so.\"\n\n\"I know that, Lady Fawn.\"\n\n\"When your time here is over, just put up your things and come back\nto Richmond. You need fear nothing with us. Frederic quite liked\nyour way of parting with him at last, and all that little affair is\nforgotten. At Fawn Court you'll be safe;--and you shall be happy,\ntoo, if we can make you happy. It's the proper place for you.\"\n\n\"Of course you'll come,\" said Diana Fawn.\n\n\"You'll be the worst little thing in the world if you don't,\" said\nLydia. \"We don't know what to do without you. Do we, mamma?\"\n\n\"Lucy will please us all by coming back to her old home,\" said Lady\nFawn. The tears were now streaming down Lucy's face, so that she was\nhardly able to say a word in answer to all this kindness. And she did\nnot know what word to say. Were she to accept the offer made to her,\nand acknowledge that she could do nothing better than creep back\nunder her old friend's wing,--would she not thereby be showing\nthat she doubted her lover? And yet she could not go to the dean's\nhouse unless the dean and his wife were pleased to take her; and,\nsuspecting as she did, that they would not be pleased, would it\nbecome her to throw upon her lover the burthen of finding for her\na home with people who did not want her? Had she been welcome at\nBobsborough, Mrs. Greystock would surely have so told her before\nthis. \"You needn't say a word, my dear,\" said Lady Fawn. \"You'll\ncome, and there's an end of it.\"\n\n\"But you don't want me any more,\" said Lucy, from amidst her sobs.\n\n\"That's just all that you know about it,\" said Lydia. \"We do want\nyou,--more than anything.\"\n\n\"I wonder whether I may come in now,\" said Lady Linlithgow, entering\nthe room. As it was the countess's own drawing-room, as it was now\nmid-winter, and as the fire in the dining-room had been allowed,\nas was usual, to sink almost to two hot coals, the request was not\nunreasonable. Lady Fawn was profuse in her thanks, and immediately\nbegan to account for Lucy's tears, pleading their dear friendship and\ntheir long absence, and poor Lucy's emotional state of mind. Then\nshe took her leave, and Lucy, as soon as she had been kissed by her\nfriends outside the drawing-room door, took herself to her bedroom,\nand finished her tears in the cold.\n\n\"Have you heard the news?\" said Lady Linlithgow to her companion\nabout a month after this. Lady Linlithgow had been out, and asked the\nquestion immediately on her return. Lucy, of course, had heard no\nnews. \"Lizzie Eustace has just come back to London, and has had all\nher jewels stolen on the road.\"\n\n\"The diamonds?\" asked Lucy, with amaze.\n\n\"Yes,--the Eustace diamonds! And they didn't belong to her any more\nthan they did to you. They've been taken, anyway; and from what I\nhear I shouldn't be at all surprised if she had arranged the whole\nmatter herself.\"\n\n\"Arranged that they should be stolen?\"\n\n\"Just that, my dear. It would be the very thing for Lizzie Eustace to\ndo. She's clever enough for anything.\"\n\n\"But, Lady Linlithgow--\"\n\n\"I know all about that. Of course, it would be very wicked, and if\nit were found out she'd be put in the dock and tried for her life.\nIt is just what I expect she'll come to some of these days. She has\ngone and got up a friendship with some disreputable people, and\nwas travelling with them. There was a man who calls himself Lord\nGeorge de Bruce Carruthers. I know him, and can remember when he was\nerrand-boy to a disreputable lawyer at Aberdeen.\" This assertion was\na falsehood on the part of the countess; Lord George had never been\nan errand-boy, and the Aberdeen lawyer,--as provincial Scotch lawyers\ngo,--had been by no means disreputable. \"I'm told that the police\nthink that he has got them.\"\n\n\"How very dreadful!\"\n\n\"Yes;--it's dreadful enough. At any rate, men got into Lizzie's room\nat night and took away the iron box and diamonds and all. It may be\nshe was asleep at the time;--but she's one of those who pretty nearly\nalways sleep with one eye open.\"\n\n\"She can't be so bad as that, Lady Linlithgow.\"\n\n\"Perhaps not. We shall see. They had just begun a lawsuit about the\ndiamonds,--to get them back. And then all at once,--they're stolen.\nIt looks what the men call--fishy. I'm told that all the police in\nLondon are up about it.\"\n\nOn the very next day who should come to Brook Street, but Lizzie\nEustace herself. She and her aunt had quarrelled, and they hated\neach other;--but the old woman had called upon Lizzie, advising her,\nas the reader will perhaps remember, to give up the diamonds, and\nnow Lizzie returned the visit. \"So you're here, installed in poor\nMacnulty's place,\" began Lizzie to her old friend, the countess at\nthe moment being out of the room.\n\n\"I am staying with your aunt for a few months,--as her companion. Is\nit true, Lizzie, that all your diamonds have been stolen?\" Lizzie\ngave an account of the robbery, true in every respect, except in\nregard to the contents of the box. Poor Lizzie had been wronged in\nthat matter by the countess, for the robbery had been quite genuine.\nThe man had opened her room and taken her box, and she had slept\nthrough it all. And then the broken box had been found, and was in\nthe hands of the police, and was evidence of the fact.\n\n\"People seem to think it possible,\" said Lizzie, \"that Mr. Camperdown\nthe lawyer arranged it all.\" As this suggestion was being made Lady\nLinlithgow came in, and then Lizzie repeated the whole story of the\nrobbery. Though the aunt and niece were open and declared enemies,\nthe present circumstances were so peculiar and full of interest that\nconversation, for a time almost amicable, took place between them.\n\"As the diamonds were so valuable, I thought it right, Aunt Susanna,\nto come and tell you myself.\"\n\n\"It's very good of you, but I'd heard it already. I was telling Miss\nMorris yesterday what very odd things there are being said about it.\"\n\n\"Weren't you very much frightened?\" asked Lucy.\n\n\"You see, my child, I knew nothing about it till it was all over. The\nman cut the bit out of the door in the most beautiful way, without my\never hearing the least sound of the saw.\"\n\n\"And you that sleep so light,\" said the countess.\n\n\"They say that perhaps something was put into the wine at dinner to\nmake me sleep.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" ejaculated the countess, who did not for a moment give up her\nown erroneous suspicion;--\"very likely.\"\n\n\"And they do say these people can do things without making the\nslightest tittle of noise. At any rate, the box was gone.\"\n\n\"And the diamonds?\" asked Lucy.\n\n\"Oh yes;--of course. And now there is such a fuss about it! The\npolice keep on coming to me almost every day.\"\n\n\"And what do the police think?\" asked Lady Linlithgow. \"I'm told that\nthey have their suspicions.\"\n\n\"No doubt they have their suspicions,\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"You travelled up with friends, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Oh yes,--with Lord George de Bruce Carruthers; and with Mrs.\nCarbuncle,--who is my particular friend, and with Lucinda Roanoke,\nwho is just going to be married to Sir Griffin Tewett. We were quite\na large party.\"\n\n\"And Macnulty?\"\n\n\"No. I left Miss Macnulty at Portray with my darling. They thought he\nhad better remain a little longer in Scotland.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes;--perhaps Lord George de Bruce Carruthers does not care for\nbabies. I can easily believe that. I wish Macnulty had been with\nyou.\"\n\n\"Why do you wish that?\" said Lizzie, who already was beginning\nto feel that the countess intended, as usual, to make herself\ndisagreeable.\n\n\"She's a stupid, dull, pig-headed creature; but one can believe what\nshe says.\"\n\n\"And don't you believe what I say?\" demanded Lizzie.\n\n\"It's all true, no doubt, that the diamonds are gone.\"\n\n\"Indeed it is.\"\n\n\"But I don't know much about Lord George de Bruce Carruthers.\"\n\n\"He's the brother of a marquis, anyway,\" said Lizzie, who thought\nthat she might thus best answer the mother of a Scotch Earl.\n\n\"I remember when he was plain George Carruthers, running about the\nstreets of Aberdeen, and it was well with him when his shoes weren't\nbroken at the toes and down at heel. He earned his bread then, such\nas it was;--nobody knows how he gets it now. Why does he call himself\nde Bruce, I wonder?\"\n\n\"Because his godfathers and godmothers gave him that name when he was\nmade a child of Christ, and an inheritor of the kingdom of heaven,\"\nsaid Lizzie, ever so pertly.\n\n\"I don't believe a bit of it.\"\n\n\"I wasn't there to see, Aunt Susanna; and therefore I can't swear to\nit. That's his name in all the peerages, and I suppose they ought to\nknow.\"\n\n\"And what does Lord George de Bruce say about the diamonds?\"\n\nNow it had come to pass that Lady Eustace herself did not feel\naltogether sure that Lord George had not had a hand in this robbery.\nIt would have been a trick worthy of a genuine Corsair to arrange and\ncarry out such a scheme for the appropriation of so rich a spoil. A\nwatch or a brooch would, of course, be beneath the notice of a good\ngenuine Corsair,--of a Corsair who was written down in the peerage as\na marquis's brother;--but diamonds worth ten thousand pounds are not\nto be had every day. A Corsair must live, and if not by plunder rich\nas that,--how then? If Lord George had concocted this little scheme,\nhe would naturally be ignorant of the true event of the robbery till\nhe should meet the humble executors of his design, and would, as\nLizzie thought, have remained unaware of the truth till his arrival\nin London. That he had been ignorant of the truth during the journey\nwas evident to her. But they had now been three days in London,\nduring which she had seen him once. At that interview he had been\nsullen and almost cross,--and had said next to nothing about the\nrobbery. He made but one remark about it. \"I have told the chief man\nhere,\" he said, \"that I shall be ready to give any evidence in my\npower when called upon. Till then I shall take no further steps in\nthe matter. I have been asked questions that should not have been\nasked.\" In saying this he had used a tone which prevented further\nconversation on the subject, but Lizzie, as she thought of it all,\nremembered his jocular remark, made in the railway carriage, as to\nthe suspicion which had already been expressed on the matter in\nregard to himself. If he had been the perpetrator, and had then found\nthat he had only stolen the box, how wonderful would be the mystery!\n\"He hasn't got anything to say,\" replied Lizzie to the question of\nthe countess.\n\n\"And who is your Mrs. Carbuncle?\" asked the old woman.\n\n\"A particular friend of mine with whom I am staying at present. You\ndon't go about a great deal, Aunt Linlithgow, but surely you must\nhave met Mrs. Carbuncle.\"\n\n\"I'm an ignorant old woman, no doubt. My dear, I'm not at all\nsurprised at your losing your diamonds. The pity is that they weren't\nyour own.\"\n\n\"They were my own.\"\n\n\"The loss will fall on you, no doubt, because the Eustace people will\nmake you pay for them. You'll have to give up half your jointure for\nyour life. That's what it will come to. To think of your travelling\nabout with those things in a box!\"\n\n\"They were my own, and I had a right to do what I liked with them.\nNobody accuses you of taking them.\"\n\n\"That's quite true. Nobody will accuse me. I suppose Lord George\nhas left England for the benefit of his health. It would not at\nall surprise me if I were to hear that Mrs. Carbuncle had followed\nhim;--not in the least.\"\n\n\"You're just like yourself, Aunt Susanna,\" said Lizzie, getting up\nand taking her leave. \"Good-bye, Lucy,--I hope you're happy and\ncomfortable here. Do you ever see a certain friend of ours now?\"\n\n\"If you mean Mr. Greystock, I haven't seen him since I left Fawn\nCourt,\" said Lucy, with dignity.\n\nWhen Lizzie was gone, Lady Linlithgow spoke her mind freely about her\nniece. \"Lizzie Eustace won't come to any good. When I heard that she\nwas engaged to that prig, Lord Fawn, I had some hopes that she might\nbe kept out of harm. That's all over, of course. When he heard about\nthe necklace he wasn't going to put his neck into that scrape. But\nnow she's getting among such a set that nothing can save her. She has\ntaken to hunting, and rides about the country like a madwoman.\"\n\n\"A great many ladies hunt,\" said Lucy.\n\n\"And she's got hold of this Lord George, and of that horrid American\nwoman that nobody knows anything about. They've got the diamonds\nbetween them, I don't doubt. I'll bet you sixpence that the police\nfind out all about it, and that there is some terrible scandal. The\ndiamonds were no more hers than they were mine, and she'll be made to\npay for them.\"\n\nThe necklace, the meanwhile, was still locked up in Lizzie's\ndesk,--with a patent Bramah key,--in Mrs. Carbuncle's house, and was\na terrible trouble to our unhappy friend.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVII\n\nMatching Priory\n\n\nBefore the end of January everybody in London had heard of the great\nrobbery at Carlisle,--and most people had heard also that there\nwas something very peculiar in the matter,--something more than a\nrobbery. Various rumours were afloat. It had become widely known that\nthe diamonds were to be the subject of litigation between the young\nwidow and the trustees of the Eustace estate; and it was known also\nthat Lord Fawn had engaged himself to marry the widow, and had then\nretreated from his engagement simply on account of this litigation.\nThere were strong parties formed in the matter,--whom we may call\nLizzieites and anti-Lizzieites. The Lizzieites were of opinion that\npoor Lady Eustace was being very ill-treated;--that the diamonds did\nprobably belong to her, and that Lord Fawn, at any rate, clearly\nought to be her own. It was worthy of remark that these Lizzieites\nwere all of them Conservatives. Frank Greystock had probably set the\nparty on foot;--and it was natural that political opponents should\nbelieve that a noble young Under-Secretary of State on the Liberal\nside,--such as Lord Fawn,--had misbehaved himself. When the matter at\nlast became of such importance as to demand leading articles in the\nnewspapers, those journals which had devoted themselves to upholding\nthe Conservative politicians of the day were very heavy indeed\nupon Lord Fawn. The whole force of the Government, however, was\nanti-Lizzieite; and as the controversy advanced, every good Liberal\nbecame aware that there was nothing so wicked, so rapacious, so bold,\nor so cunning but that Lady Eustace might have done it, or caused it\nto be done, without delay, without difficulty, and without scruple.\nLady Glencora Palliser for a while endeavoured to defend Lizzie in\nLiberal circles,--from generosity rather than from any real belief,\nand instigated, perhaps, by a feeling that any woman in society who\nwas capable of doing anything extraordinary ought to be defended.\nBut even Lady Glencora was forced to abandon her generosity, and to\nconfess, on behalf of her party, that Lizzie Eustace was--a very\nwicked young woman, indeed. All this, no doubt, grew out of the\ndiamonds, and chiefly arose from the robbery; but there had been\nenough of notoriety attached to Lizzie before the affair at Carlisle\nto make people fancy that they had understood her character long\nbefore that.\n\nThe party assembled at Matching Priory, a country house belonging\nto Mr. Palliser, in which Lady Glencora took much delight, was not\nlarge, because Mr. Palliser's uncle, the Duke of Omnium, who was\nwith them, was now a very old man, and one who did not like very\nlarge gatherings of people. Lord and Lady Chiltern were there,--that\nLord Chiltern who had been known so long and so well in the hunting\ncounties of England, and that Lady Chiltern who had been so popular\nin London as the beautiful Violet Effingham; and Mr. and Mrs. Grey\nwere there, very particular friends of Mr. Palliser's. Mr. Grey was\nnow sitting for the borough of Silverbridge, in which the Duke of\nOmnium was still presumed to have a controlling influence, in spite\nof all Reform bills, and Mrs. Grey was in some distant way connected\nwith Lady Glencora. And Madame Max Goesler was there,--a lady whose\nsociety was still much affected by the old duke; and Mr. and Mrs.\nBonteen,--who had been brought there, not, perhaps altogether because\nthey were greatly loved, but in order that the gentleman's services\nmight be made available by Mr. Palliser in reference to some great\nreform about to be introduced in monetary matters. Mr. Palliser, who\nwas now Chancellor of the Exchequer, was intending to alter the value\nof the penny. Unless the work should be too much for him, and he\nshould die before he had accomplished the self-imposed task, the\nfuture penny was to be made, under his auspices, to contain five\nfarthings, and the shilling ten pennies. It was thought that if this\ncould be accomplished, the arithmetic of the whole world would be so\nsimplified that henceforward the name of Palliser would be blessed\nby all schoolboys, clerks, shopkeepers, and financiers. But the\ndifficulties were so great that Mr. Palliser's hair was already grey\nfrom toil, and his shoulders bent by the burthen imposed upon them.\nMr. Bonteen, with two private secretaries from the Treasury, was now\nat Matching to assist Mr. Palliser;--and it was thought that both\nMr. and Mrs. Bonteen were near to madness under the pressure of\nthe five-farthing penny. Mr. Bonteen had remarked to many of his\npolitical friends that those two extra farthings that could not be\nmade to go into the shilling would put him into his cold grave before\nthe world would know what he had done,--or had rewarded him for it\nwith a handle to his name, and a pension. Lord Fawn was also at\nMatching,--a suggestion having been made to Lady Glencora by some\nleading Liberals that he should be supported in his difficulties by\nher hospitality.\n\nThe mind of Mr. Palliser himself was too deeply engaged to admit of\nits being interested in the great necklace affair; but, of all the\nothers assembled, there was not one who did not listen anxiously for\nnews on the subject. As regarded the old duke, it had been found\nto be quite a godsend; and from post to post as the facts reached\nMatching they were communicated to him. And, indeed, there were some\nthere who would not wait for the post, but had the news about poor\nLizzie's diamonds down by the wires. The matter was of the greatest\nmoment to Lord Fawn, and Lady Glencora was, perhaps, justified,\non his behalf, in demanding a preference for her affairs over the\nmessages which were continually passing between Matching and the\nTreasury respecting those two ill-conditioned farthings.\n\n\"Duke,\" she said, entering rather abruptly the small, warm, luxurious\nroom in which her husband's uncle was passing his morning, \"duke,\nthey say now that after all the diamonds were not in the box when it\nwas taken out of the room at Carlisle.\" The duke was reclining in an\neasy-chair, with his head leaning forward on his breast, and Madame\nGoesler was reading to him. It was now three o'clock, and the old\nman had been brought down to this room after his breakfast. Madame\nGoesler was reading the last famous new novel, and the duke was\ndozing. That, probably, was the fault neither of the reader nor of\nthe novelist, as the duke was wont to doze in these days. But Lady\nGlencora's tidings awakened him completely. She had the telegram in\nher hand,--so that he could perceive that the very latest news was\nbrought to him.\n\n\"The diamonds not in the box!\" he said,--pushing his head a little\nmore forward in his eagerness, and sitting with the extended fingers\nof his two hands touching each other.\n\n\"Barrington Erle says that Major Mackintosh is almost sure the\ndiamonds were not there.\" Major Mackintosh was an officer very\nhigh in the police force, whom everybody trusted implicitly, and\nas to whom the outward world believed that he could discover the\nperpetrators of any iniquity, if he would only take the trouble\nto look into it. Such was the pressing nature of his duties that\nhe found himself compelled in one way or another to give up about\nsixteen hours a day to them;--but the outer world accused him of\nidleness. There was nothing he couldn't find out;--only he would not\ngive himself the trouble to find out all the things that happened.\nTwo or three newspapers had already been very hard upon him in regard\nto the Eustace diamonds. Such a mystery as that, they said, he ought\nto have unravelled long ago. That he had not unravelled it yet was\nquite certain.\n\n\"The diamonds not in the box!\" said the duke.\n\n\"Then she must have known it,\" said Madame Goesler.\n\n\"That doesn't quite follow, Madame Max,\" said Lady Glencora.\n\n\"But why shouldn't the diamonds have been in the box?\" asked the\nduke. As this was the first intimation given to Lady Glencora of any\nsuspicion that the diamonds had not been taken with the box, and as\nthis had been received by telegraph, she could not answer the duke's\nquestion with any clear exposition of her own. She put up her hands\nand shook her head. \"What does Plantagenet think about it?\" asked the\nduke. Plantagenet Palliser was the full name of the duke's nephew and\nheir. The duke's mind was evidently much disturbed.\n\n\"He doesn't think that either the box or the diamonds were ever worth\nfive farthings,\" said Lady Glencora.\n\n\"The diamonds not in the box!\" repeated the duke. \"Madame Max, do\nyou believe that the diamonds were not in the box?\" Madame Goesler\nshrugged her shoulders and made no answer; but the shrugging of her\nshoulders was quite satisfactory to the duke, who always thought that\nMadame Goesler did everything better than anybody else. Lady Glencora\nstayed with her uncle for the best part of an hour, and every word\nspoken was devoted to Lizzie and her necklace; but as this new idea\nhad been broached, and as they had no other information than that\nconveyed in the telegram, very little light could be thrown upon it.\nBut on the next morning there came a letter from Barrington Erle to\nLady Glencora, which told so much, and hinted so much more, that it\nwill be well to give it to the reader.\n\n\n   Travellers', 29 Jan., 186--\n\n   MY DEAR LADY GLENCORA,\n\n   I hope you got my telegram yesterday. I had just seen\n   Mackintosh,--on whose behalf, however, I must say that\n   he told me as little as he possibly could. It is leaking\n   out, however, on every side, that the police believe that\n   when the box was taken out of the room at Carlisle, the\n   diamonds were not in it. As far as I can learn, they\n   ground this suspicion on the fact that they cannot trace\n   the stones. They say that, if such a lot of diamonds had\n   been through the thieves' market in London, they would\n   have left some track behind them. As far as I can judge,\n   Mackintosh thinks that Lord George has them, but that her\n   ladyship gave them to him; and that this little game of\n   the robbery at Carlisle was planned to put John Eustace\n   and the lawyers off the scent. If it should turn out that\n   the box was opened before it left Portray, that the door\n   of her ladyship's room was cut by her ladyship's self,\n   or by his lordship with her ladyship's aid, and that the\n   fragments of the box were carried out of the hotel by\n   his lordship in person, it will altogether have been so\n   delightful a plot, that all concerned in it ought to be\n   canonised,--or at least allowed to keep their plunder. One\n   of the old detectives told me that the opening of the box\n   under the arch of the railway, in an exposed place, could\n   hardly have been executed so neatly as was done;--that no\n   thief so situated would have given the time necessary to\n   it; and that, if there had been thieves at all at work,\n   they would have been traced. Against this, there is the\n   certain fact,--as I have heard from various men engaged in\n   the inquiry,--that certain persons among the community of\n   thieves are very much at loggerheads with each other,--the\n   higher, or creative department in thiefdom, accusing the\n   lower or mechanical department of gross treachery in\n   having appropriated to its own sole profit plunder, for\n   the taking of which it had undertaken to receive a certain\n   stipulated price. But then it may be the case that his\n   lordship and her ladyship have set such a rumour abroad\n   for the sake of putting the police off the scent. Upon the\n   whole, the little mystery is quite delightful; and has put\n   the ballot, and poor Mr. Palliser's five-farthinged penny,\n   quite out of joint. Nobody now cares for anything except\n   the Eustace diamonds. Lord George, I am told, has offered\n   to fight everybody or anybody, beginning with Lord Fawn\n   and ending with Major Mackintosh. Should he be innocent,\n   which, of course, is possible, the thing must be annoying.\n   I should not at all wonder myself, if it should turn out\n   that her ladyship left them in Scotland. The place there,\n   however, has been searched, in compliance with an order\n   from the police and by her ladyship's consent.\n\n   Don't let Mr. Palliser quite kill himself. I hope the\n   Bonteen plan answers. I never knew a man who could find\n   more farthings in a shilling than Mr. Bonteen. Remember\n   me very kindly to the duke, and pray enable poor Fawn to\n   keep up his spirits. If he likes to arrange a meeting with\n   Lord George, I shall be only too happy to be his friend.\n   You remember our last duel. Chiltern is with you, and\n   can put Fawn up to the proper way of getting over to\n   Flanders,--and of returning, should he chance to escape.\n\n   Yours always most faithfully,\n\n   BARRINGTON ERLE.\n\n   Of course, I'll keep you posted in everything respecting\n   the necklace till you come to town yourself.\n\n\nThe whole of this letter Lady Glencora read to the duke, to Lady\nChiltern, and to Madame Goesler;--and the principal contents of it\nshe repeated to the entire company. It was certainly the general\nbelief at Matching that Lord George had the diamonds in his\npossession,--either with or without the assistance of their late fair\npossessor.\n\nThe duke was struck with awe when he thought of all the\ncircumstances. \"The brother of a marquis!\" he said to his nephew's\nwife. \"It's such a disgrace to the peerage!\"\n\n\"As for that, duke,\" said Lady Glencora, \"the peerage is used to it\nby this time.\"\n\n\"I never heard of such an affair as this before.\"\n\n\"I don't see why the brother of a marquis shouldn't turn thief\nas well as anybody else. They say he hasn't got anything of his\nown;--and I suppose that is what makes men steal other people's\nproperty. Peers go into trade, and peeresses gamble on the Stock\nExchange. Peers become bankrupt, and the sons of peers run\naway;--just like other men. I don't see why all enterprises should\nnot be open to them. But to think of that little purring cat,\nLady Eustace, having been so very--very clever! It makes me quite\nenvious.\"\n\nAll this took place in the morning;--that is, about two o'clock;\nbut after dinner the subject became general. There might be some\nlittle reticence in regard to Lord Fawn's feelings,--but it was not\nsufficient to banish a subject so interesting from the minds and lips\nof the company. \"The Tewett marriage is to come off, after all,\" said\nMrs. Bonteen. \"I've a letter from dear Mrs. Rutter, telling me so as\na fact.\"\n\n\"I wonder whether Miss Roanoke will be allowed to wear one or two of\nthe diamonds at the wedding,\" suggested one of the private\nsecretaries.\n\n\"Nobody will dare to wear a diamond at all next season,\" said Lady\nGlencora. \"As for my own, I sha'n't think of having them out. I\nshould always feel that I was being inspected.\"\n\n\"Unless they unravel the mystery,\" said Madame Goesler.\n\n\"I hope they won't do that,\" said Lady Glencora. \"The play is too\ngood to come to an end so soon. If we hear that Lord George is\nengaged to Lady Eustace, nothing, I suppose, can be done to stop the\nmarriage.\"\n\n\"Why shouldn't she marry if she pleases?\" asked Mr. Palliser.\n\n\"I've not the slightest objection to her being married. I hope she\nwill, with all my heart. I certainly think she should have her\nhusband after buying him at such a price. I suppose Lord Fawn won't\nforbid the banns.\" These last words were only whispered to her next\nneighbour, Lord Chiltern; but poor Lord Fawn saw the whisper, and was\naware that it must have had reference to his condition.\n\nOn the next morning there came further news. The police had asked\npermission from their occupants to search the rooms in which lived\nLady Eustace and Lord George, and in each case the permission had\nbeen refused. So said Barrington Erle in his letter to Lady Glencora.\nLord George had told the applicant, very roughly, that nobody should\ntouch any article belonging to him without a search-warrant. If any\nmagistrate would dare to give such a warrant, let him do it. \"I'm\ntold that Lord George acts the indignant madman uncommonly well,\"\nsaid Barrington Erle in his letter. As for poor Lizzie, she had\nfainted when the proposition was made to her. The request was renewed\nas soon as she had been brought to herself; and then she refused,--on\nthe advice, as she said, of her cousin, Mr. Greystock. Barrington\nErle went on to say that the police were very much blamed. It was\nbelieved that no information could be laid before a magistrate\nsufficient to justify a search-warrant;--and, in such circumstances,\nno search should have been attempted. Such was the public verdict, as\ndeclared in Barrington Erle's last letter to Lady Glencora.\n\nMr. Palliser was of opinion that the attempt to search the lady's\nhouse was iniquitous. Mr. Bonteen shook his head, and rather thought\nthat, if he were Home Secretary, he would have had the search made.\nLady Chiltern said that if policemen came to her, they might search\neverything she had in the world. Mrs. Grey reminded them that all\nthey really knew of the unfortunate woman was, that her jewel-box had\nbeen stolen out of her bedroom at her hotel. Madame Goesler was of\nopinion that a lady who could carry such a box about the country with\nher deserved to have it stolen. Lord Fawn felt himself obliged to\nconfess that he agreed altogether with Madame Goesler. Unfortunately,\nhe had been acquainted with the lady, and now was constrained to say\nthat her conduct had been such as to justify the suspicions of the\npolice. \"Of course, we all suspect her,\" said Lady Glencora; \"and,\nof course, we suspect Lord George too, and Mrs. Carbuncle and Miss\nRoanoke. But then, you know, if I were to lose my diamonds, people\nwould suspect me just the same,--or perhaps Plantagenet. It is so\ndelightful to think that a woman has stolen her own property, and\nput all the police into a state of ferment.\" Lord Chiltern declared\nhimself to be heartily sick of the whole subject; and Mr. Grey, who\nwas a very just man, suggested that the evidence, as yet, against\nanybody, was very slight. \"Of course, it's slight,\" said Lady\nGlencora. \"If it were more than slight, it would be just like any\nother robbery, and there would be nothing in it.\" On the same morning\nMrs. Bonteen received a second letter from her friend Mrs. Rutter.\nThe Tewett marriage had been certainly broken off. Sir Griffin had\nbeen very violent, misbehaving himself grossly in Mrs. Carbuncle's\nhouse, and Miss Roanoke had declared that under no circumstances\nwould she ever speak to him again. It was Mrs. Rutter's opinion,\nhowever, that this violence had been \"put on\" by Sir Griffin, who\nwas desirous of escaping from the marriage because of the affair of\nthe diamonds. \"He's very much bound up with Lord George,\" said Mrs.\nRutter, \"and is afraid that he may be implicated.\"\n\n\"In my opinion he's quite right,\" said Lord Fawn.\n\nAll these matters were told to the duke by Lady Glencora and Madame\nGoesler in the recesses of his grace's private room; for the duke\nwas now infirm, and did not dine in company unless the day was\nvery auspicious to him. But in the evening he would creep into the\ndrawing-room, and on this occasion he had a word to say about the\nEustace diamonds to every one in the room. It was admitted by them\nall that the robbery had been a godsend in the way of amusing the\nduke. \"Wouldn't have her boxes searched, you know,\" said the duke;\n\"that looks uncommonly suspicious. Perhaps, Lady Chiltern, we shall\nhear to-morrow morning something more about it.\"\n\n\"Poor dear duke,\" said Lady Chiltern to her husband.\n\n\"Doting old idiot!\" he replied.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVIII\n\nLizzie's Condition\n\n\nWhen such a man as Barrington Erle undertakes to send information\nto such a correspondent as Lady Glencora in reference to such a\nmatter as Lady Eustace's diamonds, he is bound to be full rather\nthan accurate. We may say, indeed, that perfect accuracy would be\ndetrimental rather than otherwise, and would tend to disperse that\nfeeling of mystery which is so gratifying. No suggestion had in truth\nbeen made to Lord George de Bruce Carruthers as to the searching of\nhis lordship's boxes and desks. That very eminent detective officer,\nMr. Bunfit, had, however, called upon Lord George more than once, and\nLord George had declared very plainly that he did not like it. \"If\nyou'll have the kindness to explain to me what it is you want, I'll\nbe much obliged to you,\" Lord George had said to Mr. Bunfit.\n\n\"Well, my lord,\" said Bunfit, \"what we want is these diamonds.\"\n\n\"Do you believe that I've got them?\"\n\n\"A man in my situation, my lord, never believes anything. We has to\nsuspect, but we never believes.\"\n\n\"You suspect that I stole them?\"\n\n\"No, my lord;--I didn't say that. But things are very queer; aren't\nthey?\" The immediate object of Mr. Bunfit's visit on this morning\nhad been to ascertain from Lord George whether it was true that his\nlordship had been with Messrs. Harter and Benjamin, the jewellers,\non the morning after his arrival in town. No one from the police\nhad as yet seen either Harter or Benjamin in connexion with this\nrobbery; but it may not be too much to say that the argus eyes of\nMajor Mackintosh were upon Messrs. Harter and Benjamin's whole\nestablishment, and it was believed that, if the jewels were in\nLondon, they were locked up in some box within that house. It was\nthought more than probable by Major Mackintosh and his myrmidons that\nthe jewels were already at Hamburg; and by this time, as the major\nhad explained to Mr. Camperdown, every one of them might have been\nreset,--or even recut. But it was known that Lord George had been at\nthe house of Messrs. Harter and Benjamin early on the morning after\nhis return to town, and the ingenuous Mr. Bunfit, who, by reason\nof his situation, never believed anything and only suspected, had\nexpressed a very strong opinion to Major Mackintosh that the necklace\nhad in truth been transferred to the Jews on that morning. That there\nwas nothing \"too hot or too heavy\" for Messrs. Harter and Benjamin\nwas quite a creed with the police of the west end of London. Might it\nnot be well to ask Lord George what he had to say about the visit?\nShould Lord George deny the visit, such denial would go far to\nconfirm Mr. Bunfit. The question was asked, and Lord George did not\ndeny the visit. \"Unfortunately, they hold acceptances of mine,\" said\nLord George, \"and I am often there.\" \"We know as they have your\nlordship's name to paper,\" said Mr. Bunfit,--thanking Lord George,\nhowever, for his courtesy. It may be understood that all this would\nbe unpleasant to Lord George, and that he should be indignant almost\nto madness.\n\nBut Mr. Erle's information, though certainly defective in regard to\nLord George de Bruce Carruthers, had been more correct when he spoke\nof the lady. An interview that was very terrible to poor Lizzie did\ntake place between her and Mr. Bunfit in Mrs. Carbuncle's house on\nTuesday, the 30th of January. There had been many interviews between\nLizzie and various members of the police force in reference to the\ndiamonds, but the questions put to her had always been asked on the\nsupposition that she might have mislaid the necklace. Was it not\npossible that she might have thought that she locked it up, but\nhave omitted to place it in the box? As long as these questions had\nreference to a possible oversight in Scotland,--to some carelessness\nwhich she might have committed on the night before she left her\nhome,--Lizzie upon the whole seemed rather to like the idea. It\ncertainly was possible. She believed thoroughly that the diamonds had\nbeen locked by her in the box,--but she acknowledged that it might be\nthe case that they had been left on one side. This had happened when\nthe police first began to suspect that the necklace had not been in\nthe box when it was carried out of the Carlisle hotel, but before\nit had occurred to them that Lord George had been concerned in\nthe robbery, and possibly Lady Eustace herself. Men had been sent\ndown from London, of course at considerable expense, and Portray\nCastle had been searched, with the consent of its owner, from the\nweathercock to the foundation-stone,--much to the consternation of\nMiss Macnulty, and to the delight of Andy Gowran. No trace of the\ndiamonds was found, and Lizzie had so far fraternised with the\npolice. But when Mr. Bunfit called upon her, perhaps for the fifth\nor sixth time, and suggested that he should be allowed, with the\nassistance of the female whom he had left behind him in the hall, to\nsearch all her ladyship's boxes, drawers, presses, and receptacles in\nLondon, the thing took a very different aspect. \"You see, my lady,\"\nsaid Mr. Bunfit, excusing the peculiar nature of his request, \"it may\nhave got anywhere among your ladyship's things, unbeknownst.\" Lady\nEustace and Mrs. Carbuncle were at the time sitting together, and\nMrs. Carbuncle was the first to protest. If Mr. Bunfit thought that\nhe was going to search her things, Mr. Bunfit was very much mistaken.\nWhat she had suffered about this necklace no man or woman knew,--and\nshe meant that there should be an end of it. It was her opinion that\nthe police should have discovered every stone of it days and days\nago. At any rate, her house was her own, and she gave Mr. Bunfit to\nunderstand that his repeated visits were not agreeable to her. But\nwhen Mr. Bunfit, without showing the slightest displeasure at the\nevil things said of him, suggested that the search should be confined\nto the rooms used exclusively by Lady Eustace, Mrs. Carbuncle\nabsolutely changed her views, and recommended that he should be\nallowed to have his way.\n\nAt that moment the condition of poor Lizzie Eustace was very sad.\nHe who recounts these details has scorned to have a secret between\nhimself and his readers. The diamonds were at this moment locked\nup within Lizzie's desk. For the last three weeks they had been\nthere,--if it may not be more truly said that they were lying heavily\non her heart. For three weeks had her mind with constant stretch been\nworking on that point,--whither should she take the diamonds, and\nwhat should she do with them? A certain very wonderful strength she\ndid possess, or she could not have endured the weight of so terrible\nan anxiety; but from day to day the thing became worse and worse\nwith her, as gradually she perceived that suspicion was attached to\nherself. Should she confide the secret to Lord George, or to Mrs.\nCarbuncle, or to Frank Greystock? She thought she could have borne\nit all if only some one would have borne it with her. But when the\nmoments came in which such confidence might be made, her courage\nfailed her. Lord George she saw frequently; but he was unsympathetic\nand almost rough with her. She knew that he also was suspected, and\nshe was almost disposed to think that he had planned the robbery.\nIf it were so, if the robbery had been his handiwork, it was not\nsingular that he should be unsympathetic with the owner and probable\nholder of the prey which he had missed. Nevertheless Lizzie thought\nthat if he would have been soft with her, like a dear, good, genuine\nCorsair, for half an hour, she would have told him all, and placed\nthe necklace in his hands. And there were moments in which she\nalmost resolved to tell her secret to Mrs. Carbuncle. She had stolen\nnothing;--so she averred to herself. She had intended only to defend\nand save her own property. Even the lie that she had told, and the\ntelling of which was continued from day to day, had in a measure been\nforced upon her by circumstances. She thought that Mrs. Carbuncle\nwould sympathise with her in that feeling which had prevented her\nfrom speaking the truth when first the fact of the robbery was made\nknown to herself in her own bedroom. Mrs. Carbuncle was a lady\nwho told many lies, as Lizzie knew well,--and surely could not be\nhorrified at a lie told in such circumstances. But it was not in\nLizzie's nature to trust a woman. Mrs. Carbuncle would tell Lord\nGeorge,--and that would destroy everything. When she thought of\nconfiding everything to her cousin, it was always in his absence. The\nidea became dreadful to her as soon as he was present. She could not\ndare to own to him that she had sworn falsely to the magistrate at\nCarlisle. And so the burthen had to be borne, increasing every hour\nin weight, and the poor creature's back was not broad enough to bear\nit. She thought of the necklace every waking minute, and dreamed of\nit when she slept. She could not keep herself from unlocking her desk\nand looking at it twenty times a day, although she knew the peril\nof such nervous solicitude. If she could only rid herself of it\naltogether, she was sure now that she would do so. She would throw\nit into the ocean fathoms deep, if only she could find herself alone\nupon the ocean. But she felt that, let her go where she might, she\nwould be watched. She might declare to-morrow her intention of going\nto Ireland,--or, for that matter, to America. But, were she to do so,\nsome horrid policeman would be on her track. The iron box had been\na terrible nuisance to her;--but the iron box had been as nothing\ncompared to the necklace locked up in her desk. From day to day\nshe meditated a plan of taking the thing out into the streets, and\ndropping it in the dark; but she was sure that, were she to do\nso, some one would have watched her while she dropped it. She was\nunwilling to trust her old friend Mr. Benjamin; but in these days her\nfavourite scheme was to offer the diamonds for sale to him at some\nvery low price. If he would help her they might surely be got out of\ntheir present hiding-place into his hands. Any man would be powerful\nto help, if there were any man whom she could trust. In furtherance\nof this scheme she went so far as to break a brooch,--a favourite\nbrooch of her own,--in order that she might have an excuse for\ncalling at the jewellers'. But even this she postponed from day to\nday. Circumstances, as they had occurred, had taught her to believe\nthat the police could not insist on breaking open her desk unless\nsome evidence could be brought against her. There was no evidence,\nand her desk was so far safe. But the same circumstances had made\nher understand that she was already suspected of some intrigue with\nreference to the diamonds,--though of what she was suspected she did\nnot clearly perceive. As far as she could divine the thoughts of her\nenemies, they did not seem to suppose that the diamonds were in her\npossession. It seemed to be believed by those enemies that they had\npassed into the hands of Lord George. As long as her enemies were on\na scent so false, might it not be best that she should remain quiet?\n\nBut all the ingenuity, the concentrated force, and trained experience\nof the police of London would surely be too great and powerful for\nher in the long run. She could not hope to keep her secret and the\ndiamonds till they should acknowledge themselves to be baffled. And\nthen she was aware of a morbid desire on her own part to tell the\nsecret,--of a desire that amounted almost to a disease. It would soon\nburst her bosom open, unless she could share her knowledge with some\none. And yet, as she thought of it all, she told herself that she had\nno friend so fast and true as to justify such confidence. She was ill\nwith anxiety, and,--worse than that,--Mrs. Carbuncle knew that she\nwas ill. It was acknowledged between them that this affair of the\nnecklace was so terrible as to make a woman ill. Mrs. Carbuncle at\npresent had been gracious enough to admit so much as that. But might\nit not be probable that Mrs. Carbuncle would come to suspect that she\ndid not know the whole secret? Mrs. Carbuncle had already, on more\nthan one occasion, said a little word or two which had been\nunpleasant.\n\nSuch was Lizzie's condition when Mr. Bunfit came, with his\nauthoritative request to be allowed to inspect Lizzie's boxes,--and\nwhen Mrs. Carbuncle, having secured her own privacy, expressed her\nopinion that Mr. Bunfit should be allowed to do as he desired.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIX\n\nBunfit and Gager\n\n\nAs soon as the words were out of Mrs. Carbuncle's mouth,--those\nill-natured words in which she expressed her assent to Mr. Bunfit's\nproposition that a search should be made after the diamonds among\nall the possessions of Lady Eustace which were now lodged in her own\nhouse,--poor Lizzie's courage deserted her entirely. She had been\nvery courageous; for, though her powers of endurance had sometimes\nnearly deserted her, though her heart had often failed her, still\nshe had gone on and had endured and been silent. To endure and to be\nsilent in her position did require great courage. She was all alone\nin her misery, and could see no way out of it. The diamonds were\nheavy as a load of lead within her bosom. And yet she had persevered.\nNow, as she heard Mrs. Carbuncle's words, her courage failed her.\nThere came some obstruction in her throat, so that she could not\nspeak. She felt as though her heart were breaking. She put out both\nher hands and could not draw them back again. She knew that she\nwas betraying herself by her weakness. She could just hear the man\nexplaining that the search was merely a thing of ceremony,--just to\nsatisfy everybody that there was no mistake;--and then she fainted.\nSo far, Barrington Erle was correct in the information given by him\nto Lady Glencora. She pressed one hand against her heart, gasped for\nbreath, and then fell back upon the sofa. Perhaps she could have\ndone nothing better. Had the fainting been counterfeit, the measure\nwould have shown ability. But the fainting was altogether true. Mrs.\nCarbuncle first, and then Mr. Bunfit, hurried from their seats to\nhelp her. To neither of them did it occur for a moment that the fit\nwas false.\n\n\"The whole thing has been too much for her,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle\nseverely, ringing the bell at the same time for further aid.\n\n\"No doubt,--mum; no doubt. We has to see a deal of this sort of\nthing. Just a little air, if you please, mum,--and as much water as'd\ngo to christen a babby. That's always best, mum.\"\n\n\"If you'll have the kindness to stand on one side,\" said Mrs.\nCarbuncle, as she stretched Lizzie on the sofa.\n\n\"Certainly, mum,\" said Bunfit, standing erect by the wall, but not\nshowing the slightest disposition to leave the room.\n\n\"You had better go,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle,--loudly and very severely.\n\n\"I'll just stay and see her come to, mum. I won't do her a morsel of\nharm, mum. Sometimes they faints at the very fust sight of such as\nwe; but we has to bear it. A little more air, if you could, mum;--and\njust dash the water on in drops like. They feels a drop more than\nthey would a bucketful,--and then when they comes to they hasn't to\nchange theirselves.\"\n\nBunfit's advice, founded on much experience, was good, and Lizzie\ngradually came to herself and opened her eyes. She immediately\nclutched at her breast, feeling for her key. She found it unmoved,\nbut before her finger had recognised the touch, her quick mind had\ntold her how wrong the movement had been. It had been lost upon Mrs.\nCarbuncle, but not on Mr. Bunfit. He did not at once think that she\nhad the diamonds in her desk; but he felt almost sure that there was\nsomething in her possession,--probably some document,--which, if\nfound, would place him on the track of the diamonds. But he could\nnot compel a search. \"Your ladyship'll soon be better,\" said Bunfit\ngraciously. Lizzie endeavoured to smile as she expressed her assent\nto this proposition. \"As I was a saying to the elder lady--\"\n\n\"Saying to who, sir?\" exclaimed Mrs. Carbuncle, rising up in wrath.\n\"Elder, indeed!\"\n\n\"As I was a venturing to explain, these fits of fainting come often\nin our way. Thieves, mum,--that is, the regulars,--don't mind us a\nbit, and the women is more hardeneder than the men; but when we has\nto speak to a lady, it is so often that she goes off like that! I've\nknown 'em do it just at being looked at.\"\n\n\"Don't you think, sir, that you'd better leave us now?\" said Mrs.\nCarbuncle.\n\n\"Indeed you had,\" said Lizzie. \"I'm fit for nothing just at present.\"\n\n\"We won't disturb your ladyship the least in life,\" said Mr. Bunfit,\n\"if you'll only just let us have your keys. Your servant can be with\nus, and we won't move one tittle of anything.\" But Lizzie, though she\nwas still suffering that ineffable sickness which always accompanies\nand follows a real fainting-fit, would not surrender her keys.\nAlready had an excuse for not doing so occurred to her. But for a\nwhile she seemed to hesitate. \"I don't demand it, Lady Eustace,\" said\nMr. Bunfit, \"but if you'll allow me to say so, I do think it will\nlook better for your ladyship.\"\n\n\"I can take no step without consulting my cousin, Mr. Greystock,\"\nsaid Lizzie; and having thought of this she adhered to it. The\ndetective supplied her with many reasons for giving up her keys,\nalleging that it would do no harm, and that her refusal would create\ninfinite suspicions. But Lizzie had formed her answer and stuck\nto it. She always consulted her cousin, and always acted upon his\nadvice. He had already cautioned her not to take any steps without\nhis sanction. She would do nothing till he consented. If Mr. Bunfit\nwould see Mr. Greystock, and if Mr. Greystock would come to her and\ntell her to submit,--she would submit. Ill as she was, she could\nbe obstinate, and Bunfit left the house without having been able\nto finger that key which he felt sure that Lady Eustace carried\nsomewhere on her person.\n\nAs he walked back to his own quarters in Scotland Yard, Bunfit was by\nno means dissatisfied with his morning's work. He had not expected to\nfind anything with Lady Eustace, and, when she fainted, had not hoped\nto be allowed to search. But he was now sure that her ladyship was\npossessed, at any rate, of some guilty knowledge. Bunfit was one\nof those who, almost from the first, had believed that the box was\nempty when taken out of the hotel. \"Stones like them must turn up\nmore or less,\" was Bunfit's great argument. That the police should\nalready have found the stones themselves was not perhaps probable;\nbut had any ordinary thieves had them in their hands, they could\nnot have been passed on without leaving a trace behind them. It\nwas his opinion that the box had been opened and the door cut\nby the instrumentality and concurrence of Lord George de Bruce\nCarruthers,--with the assistance of some well-skilled mechanical\nthief. Nothing could be made out of the tall footman;--indeed,\nthe tall footman had already been set at liberty, although he was\nknown to have evil associates; and the tall footman was now loud in\ndemanding compensation for the injury done to him. Many believed that\nthe tall footman had been concerned in the matter,--many, that is,\namong the experienced craftsmen of the police force. Bunfit thought\notherwise. Bunfit believed that the diamonds were now either in the\npossession of Lord George or of Harter and Benjamin, that they had\nbeen handed over to Lord George to save them from Messrs. Camperdown\nand the lawsuit, and that Lord George and the lady were lovers. The\nlady's conduct at their last interview, her fit of fainting, and\nher clutching for the key, all confirmed Bunfit in his opinion. But\nunfortunately for Bunfit he was almost alone in his opinion. There\nwere men in the force,--high in their profession as detectives,--who\navowed that certainly two very experienced and well-known thieves had\nbeen concerned in the business. That a certain Mr. Smiler had been\nthere,--a gentleman for whom the whole police of London entertained a\nfeeling which approached to veneration, and that most diminutive of\nfull-grown thieves, Billy Cann,--most diminutive but at the same time\nmost expert,--was not doubted by some minds which were apt to doubt\ntill conviction had become certainty. The traveller who had left the\nScotch train at Dumfries had been a very small man, and it was a\nknown fact that Mr. Smiler had left London by train, from the Euston\nSquare station, on the day before that on which Lizzie and her party\nhad reached Carlisle. If it were so, if Mr. Smiler and Billy Cann had\nboth been at work at the hotel, then,--so argued they who opposed the\nBunfit theory,--it was hardly conceivable that the robbery should\nhave been arranged by Lord George. According to the Bunfit theory,\nthe only thing needed by the conspirators had been that the diamonds\nshould be handed over by Lady Eustace to Lord George in such a way\nas to escape suspicion that such transfer had been made. This might\nhave been done with very little trouble,--by simply leaving the box\nempty, with the key in it. The door of the bedroom had been opened\nby skilful professional men, and the box had been forced by the use\nof tools which none but professional gentlemen would possess. Was it\nprobable that Lord George would have committed himself with such men,\nand incurred the very heavy expense of paying for their services,\nwhen he was,--according to the Bunfit theory,--able to get at the\ndiamonds without any such trouble, danger, and expenditure? There\nwas a young detective in the force, very clever,--almost too clever,\nand certainly a little too fast,--Gager by name, who declared that\nthe Bunfit theory \"warn't on the cards.\" According to Gager's\ninformation, Smiler was at this moment a broken-hearted man,--ranging\nbetween mad indignation and suicidal despondency, because he had been\ntreated with treachery in some direction. Mr. Gager was as fully\nconvinced as Bunfit that the diamonds had not been in the box. There\nwas bitter, raging, heart-breaking disappointment about the diamonds\nin more quarters than one. That there had been a double robbery Gager\nwas quite sure;--or rather a robbery in which two sets of thieves had\nbeen concerned, and in which one set had been duped by the other set.\nIn this affair Mr. Smiler and poor little Billy Cann had been the\ndupes. So far Gager's mind had arrived at certainty. But then how had\nthey been duped, and who had duped them? And who had employed them?\nSuch a robbery would hardly have been arranged and executed except\non commission. Even Mr. Smiler would not have burthened himself with\nsuch diamonds without knowing what to do with them, and what he\nshould get for them. That they were intended ultimately for the hands\nof Messrs. Harter and Benjamin, Gager almost believed. And Gager\nwas inclined to think that Messrs. Harter and Benjamin,--or rather\nMr. Benjamin, for Mr. Harter himself was almost too old for work\nrequiring so very great mental activity,--that Mr. Benjamin, fearing\nthe honesty of his executive officer Mr. Smiler, had been splendidly\ntreacherous to his subordinate. Gager had not quite completed his\ntheory; but he was very firm on one great point,--that the thieves at\nCarlisle had been genuine thieves, thinking that they were stealing\nthe diamonds, and finding their mistake out when the box had been\nopened by them under the bridge. \"Who have 'em, then?\" asked Bunfit\nof his younger brother, in a disparaging whisper.\n\n\"Well; yes; who 'ave 'em? It's easy to say, who 'ave 'em? Suppose\n'e 'ave 'em.\" The \"he\" alluded to by Gager was Lord George de Bruce\nCarruthers. \"But laws, Bunfit, they're gone--weeks ago. You know\nthat, Bunfit.\" This had occurred before the intended search among\npoor Lizzie's boxes, but Bunfit's theory had not been shaken. Bunfit\ncould see all round his own theory. It was whole, and the motives as\nwell as the operations of the persons concerned were explained by it.\nBut the Gager theory only went to show what had not been done, and\noffered no explanation of the accomplished scheme. Then Bunfit went a\nlittle further in his theory, not disdaining to accept something from\nGager. Perhaps Lord George had engaged these men, and had afterwards\nfound it practicable to get the diamonds without their assistance. On\none great point all concerned in the inquiry were in unison,--that\nthe diamonds had not been in the box when it was carried out of the\nbedroom at Carlisle. The great point of difference consisted in this,\nthat whereas Gager was sure that the robbery when committed had been\ngenuine, Bunfit was of opinion that the box had been first opened,\nand then taken out of the hotel in order that the police might be put\non a wrong track.\n\nThe matter was becoming very important. Two or three of the leading\nnewspapers had first hinted at and then openly condemned the\nincompetence and slowness of the police. Such censure, as we all\nknow, is very common, and in nine cases out of ten it is unjust. They\nwho write it probably know but little of the circumstances;--and, in\nspeaking of a failure here and a failure there, make no reference\nto the numerous successes, which are so customary as to partake\nof the nature of routine. It is the same in regard to all public\nmatters,--army matters, navy matters, poor-law matters, and\npost-office matters. Day after day, and almost every day, one meets\ncensure which is felt to be unjust;--but the general result of all\nthis injustice is increased efficiency. The coach does go the faster\nbecause of the whip in the coachman's hand, though the horses driven\nmay never have deserved the thong. In this matter of the Eustace\ndiamonds the police had been very active; but they had been\nunsuccessful, and had consequently been abused. The robbery was now\nmore than three weeks old. Property to the amount of ten thousand\npounds had been abstracted, and as yet the police had not even formed\nan assured opinion on the subject! Had the same thing occurred in\nNew York or Paris every diamond would by this time have been traced.\nSuch were the assertions made, and the police were instigated to new\nexertions. Bunfit would have jeopardised his right hand, and Gager\nhis life, to get at the secret. Even Major Mackintosh was anxious.\n\nThe facts of the claim made by Mr. Camperdown, and of the bill which\nhad been filed in Chancery for the recovery of the diamonds, were\nof course widely known, and added much to the general interest and\ncomplexity. It was averred that Mr. Camperdown's determination\nto get the diamonds had been very energetic, and Lady Eustace's\ndetermination to keep them equally so. Wonderful stories were told of\nLizzie's courage, energy, and resolution. There was hardly a lawyer\nof repute but took up the question, and had an opinion as to Lizzie's\nright to the necklace. The Attorney and Solicitor-General were dead\nagainst her, asserting that the diamonds certainly did not pass to\nher under the will, and could not have become hers by gift. But they\nwere members of a Liberal government, and of course anti-Lizzieite.\nGentlemen who were equal to them in learning, who had held offices\nequally high, were distinctly of a different opinion. Lady\nEustace might probably claim the jewels as paraphernalia properly\nappertaining to her rank;--in which claim the bestowal of them by her\nhusband would no doubt assist her. And to these gentlemen,--who were\nLizzieites and of course Conservatives in politics,--it was by no\nmeans clear that the diamonds did not pass to her by will. If it\ncould be shown that the diamonds had been lately kept in Scotland,\nthe ex-Attorney-General thought that they would so pass. All which\nquestions, now that the jewels had been lost, were discussed openly,\nand added greatly to the anxiety of the police. Both Lizzieites and\nanti-Lizzieites were disposed to think that Lizzie was very clever.\n\nFrank Greystock in these days took up his cousin's part altogether in\ngood faith. He entertained not the slightest suspicion that she was\ndeceiving him in regard to the diamonds. That the robbery had been a\nbona-fide robbery, and that Lizzie had lost her treasure, was to him\nbeyond doubt. He had gradually convinced himself that Mr. Camperdown\nwas wrong in his claim, and was strongly of opinion that Lord Fawn\nhad disgraced himself by his conduct to the lady. When he now heard,\nas he did hear, that some undefined suspicion was attached to his\ncousin,--and when he heard also, as unfortunately he did hear,--that\nLord Fawn had encouraged that suspicion, he was very irate, and said\ngrievous things of Lord Fawn. It seemed to him to be the extremity\nof cruelty that suspicion should be attached to his cousin because\nshe had been robbed of her jewels. He was among those who were most\nsevere in their denunciation of the police,--and was the more so,\nbecause he had heard it asserted that the necklace had not in truth\nbeen stolen. He busied himself very much in the matter, and even\ninterrogated John Eustace as to his intentions. \"My dear fellow,\"\nsaid Eustace, \"if you hated those diamonds as much as I do, you would\nnever mention them again.\" Greystock declared that this expression of\naversion to the subject might be all very well for Mr. Eustace, but\nthat he found himself bound to defend his cousin. \"You cannot defend\nher against me,\" said Eustace, \"for I do not attack her. I have never\nsaid a word against her. I went down to Portray when she asked me. As\nfar as I am concerned she is perfectly welcome to wear the necklace,\nif she can get it back again. I will not make or meddle in the matter\none way or the other.\" Frank, after that, went to Mr. Camperdown, but\nhe could get no satisfaction from the attorney. Mr. Camperdown would\nonly say that he had a duty to do, and that he must do it. On the\nmatter of the robbery he refused to give an opinion. That was in the\nhands of the police. Should the diamonds be recovered, he would, of\ncourse, claim them on behalf of the estate. In his opinion, whether\nthe diamonds were recovered or not, Lady Eustace was responsible to\nthe estate for their value. In opposition, first to the entreaties,\nand then to the demands of her late husband's family, she had\ninsisted on absurdly carrying about with her an enormous amount of\nproperty which did not belong to her. Mr. Camperdown opined that\nshe must pay for the lost diamonds out of her jointure. Frank, in a\nhuff, declared that, as far as he could see, the diamonds belonged\nto his cousin;--in answer to which Mr. Camperdown suggested that\nthe question was one for the decision of the Vice-Chancellor. Frank\nGreystock found that he could do nothing with Mr. Camperdown, and\nfelt that he could wreak his vengeance only on Lord Fawn.\n\nBunfit, when he returned from Mrs. Carbuncle's house to Scotland\nYard, had an interview with Major Mackintosh. \"Well, Bunfit, have you\nseen the lady?\"\n\n\"Yes,--I did see her, sir.\"\n\n\"And what came of it?\"\n\n\"She fainted away, sir--just as they always do.\"\n\n\"There was no search, I suppose?\"\n\n\"No, sir;--no search. She wouldn't have it, unless her cousin, Mr.\nGreystock, permitted.\"\n\n\"I didn't think she would.\"\n\n\"Nor yet didn't I, sir. But I'll tell you what it is, major. She\nknows all about it.\"\n\n\"You think she does, Bunfit?\"\n\n\"She does, sir; and she's got something locked up somewhere in that\nhouse as'd elucidate the whole of this aggravating mystery, if only\nwe could get at it. Major,--\"\n\n\"Well, Bunfit?\"\n\n\"I ain't noways sure as she ain't got them very diamonds themselves\nlocked up, or, perhaps, tied round her person.\"\n\n\"Neither am I sure that she has not,\" said the major.\n\n\"The robbery at Carlisle was no robbery,\" continued Bunfit. \"It was\na got-up plant, and about the best as I ever knowed. It's my mind\nthat it was a got-up plant between her ladyship and his lordship; and\neither the one or the other is just keeping the diamonds till it's\nsafe to take 'em into the market.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L\n\nIn Hertford Street\n\n\nDuring all this time Lucinda Roanoke was engaged to marry Sir Griffin\nTewett, and the lover was an occasional visitor in Hertford Street.\nMrs. Carbuncle was as anxious as ever that the marriage should be\ncelebrated on the appointed day, and though there had been repeated\nquarrels, nothing had as yet taken place to make her despond. Sir\nGriffin would make some offensive speech; Lucinda would tell him\nthat she had no desire ever to see him again; and then the baronet,\nusually under the instigation of Lord George, would make some awkward\napology. Mrs. Carbuncle,--whose life at this period was not a\npleasant one,--would behave on such occasions with great patience,\nand sometimes with great courage. Lizzie, who in her present\nemergency could not bear the idea of losing the assistance of any\nfriend, was soft and graceful, and even gracious, to the bear. The\nbear himself certainly seemed to desire the marriage, though he would\nso often give offence which made any prospect of a marriage almost\nimpossible. But with Sir Griffin, when the prize seemed to be lost,\nit again became valuable. He would talk about his passionate love to\nMrs. Carbuncle, and to Lizzie,--and then, when things had been made\nstraight for him, he would insult them, and neglect Lucinda. To\nLucinda herself, however, he would rarely dare to say such words as\nhe used daily to the other two ladies in the house. What could have\nbeen the man's own idea of his future married life, how can any\nreader be made to understand, or any writer adequately describe! He\nmust have known that the woman despised him, and hated him. In the\nvery bottom of his heart he feared her. He had no idea of other\npleasure from her society than what might arise to him from the pride\nof having married a beautiful woman. Had she shown the slightest\nfondness for him, the slightest fear that she might lose him, the\nslightest feeling that she had won a valuable prize in getting him,\nhe would have scorned her, and jilted her without the slightest\nremorse. But the scorn came from her, and it beat him down.\n\"Yes;--you hate me, and would fain be rid of me; but you have said\nthat you will be my wife, and you cannot now escape me.\" Sir Griffin\ndid not exactly speak such words as these, but he acted them. Lucinda\nwould bear his presence,--sitting apart from him, silent, imperious,\nbut very beautiful. People said that she became more handsome from\nday to day, and she did so, in spite of her agony. Hers was a face\nwhich could stand such condition of the heart without fading or\nsinking under it. She did not weep, or lose her colour, or become\nthin. The pretty softness of a girl,--delicate feminine weakness,\nor laughing eyes and pouting lips, no one expected from her. Sir\nGriffin, in the early days of their acquaintance, had found her to be\na woman with a character for beauty,--and she was now more beautiful\nthan ever. He probably thought that he loved her; but, at any rate,\nhe was determined that he would marry her.\n\nHe had expressed himself more than once as very angry about this\naffair of the jewels. He had told Mrs. Carbuncle that her inmate,\nLady Eustace, was suspected by the police, and that it might be well\nthat Lady Eustace should be--be made to go, in fact. But it did not\nsuit Mrs. Carbuncle that Lady Eustace should be made to go;--nor\ndid it suit Lord George de Bruce Carruthers. Lord George, at Mrs.\nCarbuncle's instance, had snubbed Sir Griffin more than once, and\nthen it came to pass that he was snubbed yet again more violently\nthan before. He was at the house in Hertford Street on the day of Mr.\nBunfit's visit, some hours after Mr. Bunfit was gone, when Lizzie was\nstill lying on her bed up-stairs, nearly beaten by the great danger\nwhich had oppressed her. He was told of Mr. Bunfit's visit, and then\nagain said that he thought that the continued residence of Lady\nEustace beneath that roof was a misfortune. \"Would you wish us\nto turn her out because her necklace has been stolen?\" asked Mrs.\nCarbuncle.\n\n\"People say very queer things,\" said Sir Griffin.\n\n\"So they do, Sir Griffin,\" continued Mrs. Carbuncle. \"They say such\nqueer things that I can hardly understand that they should be allowed\nto say them. I am told that the police absolutely suggest that Lord\nGeorge stole the diamonds.\"\n\n\"That's nonsense.\"\n\n\"No doubt, Sir Griffin. And so is the other nonsense. Do you mean to\ntell us that you believe that Lady Eustace stole her own diamonds?\"\n\n\"I don't see the use of having her here. Situated as I am, I have a\nright to object to it.\"\n\n\"Situated as you are, Sir Griffin!\" said Lucinda.\n\n\"Well;--yes, of course; if we are to be married, I cannot but think a\ngood deal of the persons you stay with.\"\n\n\"You were very glad to stay yourself with Lady Eustace at Portray,\"\nsaid Lucinda.\n\n\"I went there to follow you,\" said Sir Griffin gallantly.\n\n\"I wish with all my heart you had stayed away,\" said Lucinda. At\nthat moment Lord George was shown into the room, and Miss Roanoke\ncontinued speaking, determined that Lord George should know how the\nbear was conducting himself. \"Sir Griffin is saying that my aunt\nought to turn Lady Eustace out of the house.\"\n\n\"Not quite that,\" said Sir Griffin with an attempt at laughter.\n\n\"Quite that,\" said Lucinda. \"I don't suppose that he suspects poor\nLady Eustace, but he thinks that my aunt's friend should be like\nCaesar's wife, above the suspicion of others.\"\n\n\"If you would mind your own business, Tewett,\" said Lord George, \"it\nwould be a deal better for us all. I wonder Mrs. Carbuncle does not\nturn you out of the room for making such a proposition here. If it\nwere my room, I would.\"\n\n\"I suppose I can say what I please to Mrs. Carbuncle? Miss Roanoke is\nnot going to be your wife.\"\n\n\"It is my belief that Miss Roanoke will be nobody's wife,--at any\nrate, for the present,\" said that young lady;--upon which Sir Griffin\nleft the room, muttering some words which might have been, perhaps,\nintended for an adieu. Immediately after this, Lizzie came in, moving\nslowly, but without a sound, like a ghost, with pale cheeks and\ndishevelled hair, and that weary, worn look of illness which was\nbecome customary with her. She greeted Lord George with a faint\nattempt at a smile, and seated herself in a corner of a sofa. She\nasked whether he had been told the story of the proposed search, and\nthen bade her friend Mrs. Carbuncle describe the scene.\n\n\"If it goes on like this it will kill me,\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"They are treating me in precisely the same way,\" said Lord George.\n\n\"But think of your strength and of my weakness, Lord George.\"\n\n\"By heavens, I don't know!\" said Lord George. \"In this matter your\nweakness is stronger than any strength of mine. I never was so cut up\nin my life. It was a good joke when we talked of the suspicions of\nthat fellow at Carlisle as we came up by the railway,--but it is no\njoke now. I've had men with me, almost asking to search among my\nthings.\"\n\n\"They have quite asked me!\" said Lizzie piteously.\n\n\"You;--yes. But there's some reason in that. These infernal diamonds\ndid belong to you, or, at any rate, you had them. You are the last\nperson known to have seen them. Even if you had them still, you'd\nonly have what you call your own.\" Lizzie looked at him with all her\neyes and listened to him with all her ears. \"But what the mischief\ncan I have had to do with them?\"\n\n\"It's very hard upon you,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle.\n\n\"Unless I stole them,\" continued Lord George.\n\n\"Which is so absurd, you know,\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"That a pig-headed provincial fool should have taken me for a\nmidnight thief, did not disturb me much. I don't think I am very\neasily annoyed by what other people think of me. But these fellows, I\nsuppose, were sent here by the head of the metropolitan police; and\neverybody knows that they have been sent. Because I was civil enough\nto you women to look after you coming up to town, and because one\nof you was careless enough to lose her jewels, I--I am to be talked\nabout all over London as the man who took them!\" This was not spoken\nwith much courtesy to the ladies present. Lord George had dropped\nthat customary chivalry of manner which, in ordinary life, makes it\nto be quite out of the question that a man shall be uncivil to a\nwoman. He had escaped from conventional usage into rough, truthful\nspeech, under stress from the extremity of the hardship to which he\nhad been subjected. And the women understood it and appreciated it,\nand liked it rather than otherwise. To Lizzie it seemed fitting that\na Corsair so circumstanced should be as uncivil as he pleased; and\nMrs. Carbuncle had long been accustomed to her friend's moods.\n\n\"They can't really think it,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle.\n\n\"Somebody thinks it. I am told that your particular friend, Lord\nFawn,\"--this he said, specially addressing Lizzie,--\"has expressed a\nstrong opinion that I carry about the necklace always in my pocket. I\ntrust to have the opportunity of wringing his neck some day.\"\n\n\"I do so wish you would,\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"I shall not lose a chance if I can get it. Before all this occurred\nI should have said of myself that nothing of the kind could put me\nout. I don't think there is a man in the world cares less what people\nsay of him than I do. I am as indifferent to ordinary tittle-tattle\nas a rhinoceros. But, by George,--when it comes to stealing ten\nthousand pounds' worth of diamonds, and the delicate attentions\nof all the metropolitan police, one begins to feel that one is\nvulnerable. When I get up in the morning, I half feel that I shall be\nlocked up before night, and I can see in the eyes of every man I meet\nthat he takes me for the prince of burglars!\"\n\n\"And it is all my fault,\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"I wish the diamonds had been thrown into the sea,\" said Mrs.\nCarbuncle.\n\n\"What do you think about them yourself?\" asked Lucinda.\n\n\"I don't know what to think. I'm at a dead loss. You know that man\nMr. Benjamin, Lady Eustace?\" Lizzie, with a little start, answered\nthat she did,--that she had had dealings with him before her\nmarriage, and had once owed him two or three hundred pounds. As the\nman's name had been mentioned, she thought it better to own as much.\n\"So he tells me. Now, in all London, I don't suppose there is a\ngreater rascal than Benjamin.\"\n\n\"I didn't know that,\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"But I did; and with that rascal I have had money dealings for the\nlast six or seven years. He has cashed bills for me, and has my name\nto bills now,--and Sir Griffin's too. I'm half inclined to think that\nhe has got the diamonds.\"\n\n\"Do you indeed?\" said Mrs. Carbuncle.\n\n\"Mr. Benjamin!\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"And he returns the compliment.\"\n\n\"How does he return it?\" asked Mrs. Carbuncle.\n\n\"He either thinks that I've got 'em, or he wants to make me believe\nthat he thinks so. He hasn't dared to say it;--but that's his\nintention. Such an opinion from such a man on such a subject would be\nquite a compliment. And I feel it. But yet it troubles me. You know\nthat greasy, Israelitish smile of his, Lady Eustace.\" Lizzie nodded\nher head and tried to smile. \"When I asked him yesterday about the\ndiamonds, he leered at me and rubbed his hands. 'It's a pretty little\ngame;--ain't it, Lord George?' he said. I told him that I thought it\na very bad game, and that I hoped the police would have the thief and\nthe necklace soon. 'It's been managed a deal too well for that, Lord\nGeorge;--don't you think so?'\" Lord George mimicked the Jew as he\nrepeated the words, and the ladies, of course, laughed. But poor\nLizzie's attempt at laughter was very sorry. \"I told him to his face\nthat I thought he had them among his treasures. 'No, no, no, Lord\nGeorge,' he said, and seemed quite to enjoy the joke. If he's got\nthem himself, he can't think that I have them;--but if he has not, I\ndon't doubt but he believes that I have. And I'll tell you another\nperson who suspects me.\"\n\n\"What fools they are,\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"I don't know how that may be. Sir Griffin, Lucinda, isn't at all\nsure but what I have them in my pocket.\"\n\n\"I can believe anything of him,\" said Lucinda.\n\n\"And it seems he can believe anything of me. I shall begin to think\nsoon that I did take them, myself,--or, at any rate, that I ought to\nhave done so. I wonder what you three women think of it. If you do\nthink I've got 'em, don't scruple to say so. I'm quite used to it,\nand it won't hurt me any further.\" The ladies again laughed. \"You\nmust have your suspicions,\" continued he.\n\n\"I suppose some of the London thieves did get them,\" said Mrs.\nCarbuncle.\n\n\"The police say the box was empty,\" said Lord George.\n\n\"How can the police know?\" asked Lucinda. \"They weren't there to see.\nOf course, the thieves would say that they didn't take them.\"\n\n\"What do you think, Lady Eustace?\"\n\n\"I don't know what to think. Perhaps Mr. Camperdown did it.\"\n\n\"Or the Lord Chancellor,\" said Lord George. \"One is just as likely\nas the other. I wish I could get at what you really think. The whole\nthing would be so complete if all you three suspected me. I can't get\nout of it all by going to Paris or Kamschatka, as I should have half\na dozen detectives on my heels wherever I went. I must brazen it out\nhere; and the worst of it is, that I feel that a look of guilt is\ncreeping over me. I have a sort of conviction growing upon me that I\nshall be taken up and tried, and that a jury will find me guilty. I\ndream about it; and if,--as is probable,--it drives me mad, I'm sure\nthat I shall accuse myself in my madness. There's a fascination about\nit that I can't explain or escape. I go on thinking how I would have\ndone it if I did do it. I spend hours in calculating how much I would\nhave realised, and where I would have found my market. I couldn't\nkeep myself from asking Benjamin the other day how much they would be\nworth to him.\"\n\n\"What did he say?\" asked Lizzie, who sat gazing upon the Corsair, and\nwho was now herself fascinated. Lord George was walking about the\nroom, then sitting for a moment in one chair and again in another,\nand after a while leaning on the mantelpiece. In his speaking he\naddressed himself almost exclusively to Lizzie, who could not keep\nher eyes from his.\n\n\"He grinned greasily,\" said the Corsair, \"and told me they had\nalready been offered to him once before by you.\"\n\n\"That's false,\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"Very likely. And then he said that no doubt they'd fall into his\nhands some day. 'Wouldn't it be a game, Lord George,' he said, 'if,\nafter all, they should be no more than paste?' That made me think\nhe had got them, and that he'd get paste diamonds put into the same\nsetting,--and then give them up with some story of his own making.\n'You'd know whether they were paste or not; wouldn't you, Lord\nGeorge?' he asked.\" The Corsair, as he repeated Mr. Benjamin's words,\nimitated the Jew's manner so well, that he made Lizzie shudder.\n\"While I was there, a detective named Gager came in.\"\n\n\"The same man who came here, perhaps,\" suggested Mrs. Carbuncle.\n\n\"I think not. He seemed to be quite intimate with Mr. Benjamin, and\nwent on at once about the diamonds. Benjamin said that they'd made\ntheir way over to Paris, and that he'd heard of them. I found myself\ngetting quite intimate with Mr. Gager, who seemed hardly to scruple\nat showing that he thought that Benjamin and I were confederates. Mr.\nCamperdown has offered four hundred pounds reward for the jewels,--to\nbe paid on their surrender to the hands of Mr. Garnett, the jeweller.\nGager declared that, if any ordinary thief had them, they would be\ngiven up at once for that sum.\"\n\n\"That's true, I suppose,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle.\n\n\"How would the ordinary thief get his money without being detected?\nWho would dare to walk into Garnett's shop with the diamonds in\nhis hands and ask for the four hundred pounds? Besides, they have\nbeen sold to some one,--and, as I believe, to my dear friend, Mr.\nBenjamin. 'I suppose you ain't a-going anywhere just at present, Lord\nGeorge?' said that fellow Gager. 'What the devil's that to you?' I\nasked him. He just laughed and shook his head. I don't doubt but\nthat there's a policeman about waiting till I leave this house;--or\nlooking at me now with a magnifying glass from the windows at the\nother side. They've photographed me while I'm going about, and\npublished a list of every hair on my face in the 'Hue and Cry.' I\ndined at the club yesterday, and found a strange waiter. I feel\ncertain that he was a policeman done up in livery all for my sake.\nI turned sharp round in the street yesterday, and found a man at a\ncorner. I am sure that man was watching me, and was looking at my\npockets to see whether the jewel case was there. As for myself, I can\nthink of nothing else. I wish I had got them. I should have something\nthen to pay me for all this nuisance.\"\n\n\"I do wish you had,\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"What I should do with them I cannot even imagine. I am always\nthinking of that, too,--making plans for getting rid of them,\nsupposing I had stolen them. My belief is, that I should be so\nsick of them that I should chuck them over the bridge into the\nriver,--only that I should fear that some policeman's eye would be on\nme as I did it. My present position is not comfortable,--but if I had\ngot them, I think that the weight of them would crush me altogether.\nHaving a handle to my name, and being a lord, or, at least, called a\nlord, makes it all the worse. People are so pleased to think that a\nlord should have stolen a necklace.\"\n\nLizzie listened to it all with a strange fascination. If this strong\nman were so much upset by the bare suspicion, what must be her\ncondition? The jewels were in her desk up-stairs, and the police had\nbeen with her also,--were even now probably looking after her and\nwatching her. How much more difficult must it be for her to deal with\nthe diamonds than it would have been for this man. Presently Mrs.\nCarbuncle left the room, and Lucinda followed her. Lizzie saw them\ngo, and did not dare to go with them. She felt as though her limbs\nwould not have carried her to the door. She was now alone with her\nCorsair; and she looked up timidly into his deep-set eyes, as he came\nand stood over her. \"Tell me all that you know about it,\" he said, in\nthat deep, low voice which, from her first acquaintance with him, had\nfilled her with interest, and almost with awe.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI\n\nConfidence\n\n\nLizzie Eustace was speechless as she continued to look up into the\nCorsair's face. She ought to have answered him briskly, either with\nindignation or with a touch of humour. But she could not answer him\nat all. She was desired to tell him all that she knew about the\nrobbery, and she was unable to declare that she knew nothing. How\nmuch did he suspect? What did he believe? Had she been watched by\nMrs. Carbuncle, and had something of the truth been told to him?\nAnd then would it not be better for her that he should know it all?\nUnsupported and alone she could not bear the trouble which was on\nher. If she were driven to tell her secret to any one, had she not\nbetter tell it to him? She knew that if she did so, she would be a\ncreature in his hands to be dealt with as he pleased;--but would\nthere not be a certain charm in being so mastered? He was but a\npinchbeck lord. She had wit enough to know that; but then she had wit\nenough also to feel that she herself was but a pinchbeck lady. He\nwould be fit for her, and she for him,--if only he would take her.\nSince her daydreams first began, she had been longing for a Corsair;\nand here he was, not kneeling at her feet, but standing over her,--as\nbecame a Corsair. At any rate he had mastered her now, and she could\nnot speak to him.\n\nHe waited perhaps a minute, looking at her, before he renewed his\nquestion; and the minute seemed to her to be an age. During every\nsecond her power beneath his gaze sank lower and lower. There\ngradually came a grim smile over his face, and she was sure that\nhe could read her very heart. Then he called her by her Christian\nname,--as he had never called her before. \"Come, Lizzie,\" he said,\n\"you might as well tell me all about it. You know.\"\n\n\"Know what?\" The words were audible to him, though they were uttered\nin the lowest whisper.\n\n\"About this d---- necklace. What is it all? Where are they? And how\ndid you manage it?\"\n\n\"I didn't manage anything!\"\n\n\"But you know where they are?\" He paused again, still gazing at her.\nGradually there came across his face, or she fancied that it was so,\na look of ferocity which thoroughly frightened her. If he should turn\nagainst her, and be leagued with the police against her, what chance\nwould she have? \"You know where they are,\" he said, repeating his\nwords. Then at last she nodded her head, assenting to his assertion.\n\"And where are they? Come;--out with it! If you won't tell me, you\nmust tell some one else. There has been a deal too much of this\nalready.\"\n\n\"You won't betray me?\"\n\n\"Not if you deal openly with me.\"\n\n\"I will; indeed I will. And it was all an accident. When I took them\nout of the box, I only did it for safety.\"\n\n\"You did take them out of the box then?\" Again she nodded her head.\n\"And have got them now?\" There was another nod. \"And where are they?\nCome; with such a spirit of enterprise as yours you ought to be able\nto speak. Has Benjamin got them?\"\n\n\"Oh, no.\"\n\n\"And he knows nothing about them?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"Then I have wronged in my thoughts that son of Abraham?\"\n\n\"Nobody knows anything,\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"Not even Jane or Lucinda?\"\n\n\"Nothing at all.\"\n\n\"Then you have kept your secret marvellously. And where are they?\"\n\n\"Up-stairs.\"\n\n\"In your bed-room?\"\n\n\"In my desk in the little sitting-room.\"\n\n\"The Lord be good to us!\" ejaculated Lord George. \"All the police in\nLondon, from the chief downwards, are agog about this necklace. Every\nwell-known thief in the town is envied by every other thief because\nhe is thought to have had a finger in the pie. I am suspected, and\nMr. Benjamin is suspected; Sir Griffin is suspected, and half the\njewellers in London and Paris are supposed to have the stones in\ntheir keeping. Every man and woman is talking about it, and people\nare quarrelling about it till they almost cut each other's throats;\nand all the while you have got them locked up in your desk! How on\nearth did you get the box broken open and then conveyed out of your\nroom at Carlisle?\"\n\nThen Lizzie, in a frightened whisper, with her eyes often turned on\nthe floor, told the whole story. \"If I'd had a minute to think of\nit,\" she said, \"I would have confessed the truth at Carlisle. Why\nshould I want to steal what was my own? But they came to me all so\nquickly, and I didn't like to say that I had them under my pillow.\"\n\n\"I daresay not.\"\n\n\"And then I couldn't tell anybody afterwards. I always meant to tell\nyou,--from the very first; because I knew you would be good to me.\nThey are my own. Surely I might do what I liked with my own?\"\n\n\"Well,--yes; in one way. But you see there was a lawsuit in Chancery\ngoing on about them; and then you committed perjury at Carlisle. And\naltogether,--it's not quite straight sailing, you know.\"\n\n\"I suppose not.\"\n\n\"Hardly. Major Mackintosh, and the magistrates, and Messrs. Bunfit\nand Gager won't settle down, peaceable and satisfied, when they hear\nthe end of the story. And I think Messrs. Camperdown will have a bill\nagainst you. It's been uncommonly clever, but I don't see the use of\nit.\"\n\n\"I've been very foolish,\" said Lizzie,--\"but you won't desert me!\"\n\n\"Upon my word I don't know what I'm to do.\"\n\n\"Will you have them,--as a present?\"\n\n\"Certainly not.\"\n\n\"They're worth ever so much;--ten thousand pounds! And they are my\nown, to do just what I please with them.\"\n\n\"You are very good;--but what should I do with them?\"\n\n\"Sell them.\"\n\n\"Who'd buy them? And before a week was over I should be in prison,\nand in a couple of months should be standing at the Old Bailey at my\ntrial. I couldn't just do that, my dear.\"\n\n\"What will you do for me? You are my friend;--ain't you?\" The diamond\nnecklace was not a desirable possession in the eyes of Lord George\nde Bruce Carruthers;--but Portray Castle, with its income, and\nthe fact that Lizzie Eustace was still a very young woman, was\ndesirable. Her prettiness too was not altogether thrown away on Lord\nGeorge,--though, as he was wont to say to himself, he was too old now\nto sacrifice much for such a toy as that. Something he must do,--if\nonly because of the knowledge which had come to him. He could not go\naway and leave her, and neither say nor do anything in the matter.\nAnd he could not betray her to the police. \"You will not desert me!\"\nshe said, taking hold of his hand, and kissing it as a suppliant.\n\nHe passed his arm round her waist, but more as though she were a\nchild than a woman, as he stood thinking. Of all the affairs in which\nhe had ever been engaged, it was the most difficult. She submitted\nto his embrace, and leaned upon his shoulder, and looked up into his\nface. If he would only tell her that he loved her, then he would\nbe bound to her,--then must he share with her the burthen of the\ndiamonds,--then must he be true to her. \"George!\" she said, and burst\ninto a low suppressed wailing, with her face hidden upon his arm.\n\n\"That's all very well,\" said he, still holding her,--for she was\npleasant to hold,--\"but what the d---- is a fellow to do? I don't\nsee my way out of it. I think you'd better go to Camperdown, and\ngive them up to him, and tell him the truth.\" Then she sobbed more\nviolently than before, till her quick ear caught the sound of a\nfootstep on the stairs, and in a moment she was out of his arms and\nseated on the sofa, with hardly a trace of tears in her eyes. It was\nthe footman, who desired to know whether Lady Eustace would want the\ncarriage that afternoon. Lady Eustace, with her cheeriest voice, sent\nher love to Mrs. Carbuncle, and her assurance that she would not\nwant the carriage before the evening. \"I don't know that you can do\nanything else,\" continued Lord George, \"except just give them up and\nbrazen it out. I don't suppose they'd prosecute you.\"\n\n\"Prosecute me!\" ejaculated Lizzie.\n\n\"For perjury, I mean.\"\n\n\"And what could they do to me?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know. Lock you up for five years, perhaps.\"\n\n\"Because I had my own necklace under the pillow in my own room?\"\n\n\"Think of all the trouble you've given.\"\n\n\"I'll never give them up to Mr. Camperdown. They are mine;--my very\nown. My cousin, Mr. Greystock, who is much more of a lawyer than Mr.\nCamperdown, says so. Oh, George, do think of something! Don't tell me\nthat I must give them up! Wouldn't Mr. Benjamin buy them?\"\n\n\"Yes;--for half nothing; and then go and tell the whole story and get\nmoney from the other side. You can't trust Benjamin.\"\n\n\"But I can trust you.\" She clung to him and implored him, and did\nget from him a renewed promise that he would not reveal her secret.\nShe wanted him to take the terrible packet from her there and then,\nand use his own judgment in disposing of it. But this he positively\nrefused to do. He protested that they were safer with her than they\ncould be with him. He explained to her that if they were found in his\nhands, his offence in having them in his possession would be much\ngreater than hers. They were her own,--as she was ever so ready to\nassert; or if not her own, the ownership was so doubtful that she\ncould not be accused of having stolen them. And then he needed to\nconsider it all,--to sleep upon it,--before he could make up his mind\nwhat he would do.\n\nBut there was one other trouble on her mind as to which he was called\nupon to give her counsel before he was allowed to leave her. She had\ntold the detective officer that she would submit her boxes and desks\nto be searched if her cousin Frank should advise it. If the policeman\nwere to return with her cousin while the diamonds were still in her\ndesk, what should she do? He might come at any time; and then she\nwould be bound to obey him. \"And he thinks that they were stolen at\nCarlisle?\" asked Lord George. \"Of course he thinks so,\" said Lizzie,\nalmost indignantly. \"They would never ask to search your person,\"\nsuggested Lord George. Lizzie could not say. She had simply declared\nthat she would be guided by her cousin. \"Have them about you when he\ncomes. Don't take them out with you; but keep them in your pocket\nwhile you are in the house during the day. They will hardly bring a\nwoman with them to search you.\"\n\n\"But there was a woman with the man when he came before.\"\n\n\"Then you must refuse in spite of your cousin. Show yourself angry\nwith him and with everybody. Swear that you did not intend to submit\nyourself to such indignity as that. They can't do it without a\nmagistrate's order, unless you permit it. I don't suppose they will\ncome at all; and if they do they will only look at your clothes and\nyour boxes. If they ask to do more, be stout with them and refuse. Of\ncourse they'll suspect you, but they do that already. And your cousin\nwill suspect you;--but you must put up with that. It will be very\nbad;--but I see nothing better. But, of all things, say nothing of\nme.\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said Lizzie, promising to be obedient to him. And then he\ntook his leave of her. \"You will be true to me;--will you not?\" she\nsaid, still clinging to his arm. He promised her that he would. \"Oh,\nGeorge,\" she said, \"I have no friend now but you. You will care for\nme?\" He took her in his arms and kissed her, and promised her that he\nwould care for her. How was he to save himself from doing so? When he\nwas gone, Lizzie sat down to think of it all, and felt sure that at\nlast she had found her Corsair.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LII\n\nMrs. Carbuncle Goes to the Theatre\n\n\nMrs. Carbuncle and Lizzie Eustace did not, in these days, shut\nthemselves up because there was trouble in the household. It would\nnot have suited the creed of Mrs. Carbuncle on social matters to be\nshut up from the amusements of life. She had sacrificed too much\nin seeking them for that, and was too conscious of the price she\npaid for them. It was still mid-winter, but nevertheless there was\ngenerally some amusement arranged for every evening. Mrs. Carbuncle\nwas very fond of the play, and made herself acquainted with every\nnew piece as it came out. Every actor and actress of note on the\nstage was known to her, and she dealt freely in criticisms on their\nrespective merits. The three ladies had a box at the Haymarket taken\nfor this very evening, at which a new piece, \"The Noble Jilt,\" from\nthe hand of a very eminent author, was to be produced. Mrs. Carbuncle\nhad talked a great deal about \"The Noble Jilt,\" and could boast\nthat she had discussed the merits of the two chief characters with\nthe actor and actress who were to undertake them. Miss Talbot had\nassured her that the Margaret was altogether impracticable, and\nMrs. Carbuncle was quite of the same opinion. And as for the hero,\nSteinmark,--it was a part that no man could play so as to obtain\nthe sympathy of an audience. There was a second hero,--a Flemish\nCount,--tame as rain-water, Mrs. Carbuncle said. She was very anxious\nfor the success of the piece, which, as she said, had its merits;\nbut she was sure that it wouldn't do. She had talked about it a\ngreat deal, and now, when the evening came, she was not going to be\ndeterred from seeing it by any trouble in reference to a diamond\nnecklace. Lizzie, when she was left by Lord George, had many doubts\non the subject,--whether she would go or stay at home. If he would\nhave come to her, or her cousin Frank, or if, had it been possible,\nLord Fawn would have come, she would have given up the play very\nwillingly. But to be alone,--with her necklace in the desk up-stairs,\nor in her pocket, was terrible to her. And then, they could not\nsearch her or her boxes while she was at the theatre. She must not\ntake the necklace with her there. He had told her to leave it in her\ndesk, when she went from home.\n\nLucinda, also, was quite determined that she would see the new piece.\nShe declared to her aunt, in Lizzie's presence, without a vestige\nof a smile, that it might be well to see how a jilt could behave\nherself, so as to do her work of jilting in any noble fashion. \"My\ndear,\" said her aunt, \"you let things weigh upon your heart a great\ndeal too much.\" \"Not upon my heart, Aunt Jane,\" the young lady had\nanswered. She also intended to go, and when she had made up her mind\nto anything, nothing would deter her. She had no desire to stay at\nhome in order that she might see Sir Griffin. \"I daresay the play may\nbe very bad,\" she said, \"but it can hardly be so bad as real life.\"\n\nLizzie, when Lord George had left her, crept up-stairs, and sat for\nawhile thinking of her condition, with the key of her desk in her\nhand. Should there come a knock at the door, the case of diamonds\nwould be in her pocket in a moment. Her own room door was bolted on\nthe inside, so that she might have an instant for her preparation.\nShe was quite resolved that she would carry out Lord George's\nrecommendation, and that no policeman or woman should examine her\nperson, unless it were done by violence. There she sat, almost\nexpecting that at every moment her cousin would be there with Bunfit\nand the woman. But nobody came, and at six she went down to dinner.\nAfter much consideration she then left the diamonds in the desk.\nSurely no one would come to search at such an hour as that. No one\nhad come when the carriage was announced, and the three ladies went\noff together.\n\nDuring the whole way Mrs. Carbuncle talked of the terrible situation\nin which poor Lord George was placed by the robbery, and of all\nthat Lizzie owed him on account of his trouble. \"My dear,\" said Mrs.\nCarbuncle, \"the least you can do for him is to give him all that\nyou've got to give.\" \"I don't know that he wants me to give him\nanything,\" said Lizzie. \"I think that's quite plain,\" said Mrs.\nCarbuncle, \"and I'm sure I wish it may be so. He and I have been dear\nfriends,--very dear friends, and there is nothing I wish so much\nas to see him properly settled. Ill-natured people like to say all\nmanner of things because everybody does not choose to live in their\nown heartless, conventional form. But I can assure you there is\nnothing between me and Lord George which need prevent him from giving\nhis whole heart to you.\" \"I don't suppose there is,\" said Lizzie, who\nloved an opportunity of giving Mrs. Carbuncle a little rap.\n\nThe play, as a play, was a failure; at least so said Mrs. Carbuncle.\nThe critics, on the next morning, were somewhat divided,--not only in\njudgment, but as to facts. To say how a play has been received is of\nmore moment than to speak of its own merits or of the merits of the\nactors. Three or four of the papers declared that the audience was\nnot only eulogistic, but enthusiastic. One or two others averred that\nthe piece fell very flatly. As it was not acted above four or five\ndozen times consecutively, it must be regarded as a failure. On their\nway home Mrs. Carbuncle declared that Minnie Talbot had done her very\nbest with such a part as Margaret, but that the character afforded\nno scope for sympathy. \"A noble jilt, my dears,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle\neloquently, \"is a contradiction in terms. There can be no such thing.\nA woman, when she has once said the word, is bound to stick to it.\nThe delicacy of the female character should not admit of hesitation\nbetween two men. The idea is quite revolting.\"\n\n\"But may not one have an idea of no man at all?\"--asked Lucinda.\n\"Must that be revolting also?\"\n\n\"Of course a young woman may entertain such an idea; though for my\npart I look upon it as unnatural. But when she has once given herself\nthere can be no taking back without the loss of that aroma which\nshould be the apple of a young woman's eye.\"\n\n\"If she finds that she has made a mistake--?\" said Lucinda fiercely.\n\"Why shouldn't a young woman make a mistake as well as an old woman?\nHer aroma won't prevent her from having been wrong and finding it\nout.\"\n\n\"My dear, such mistakes, as you call them, always arise from\nfantastic notions. Look at this piece. Why does the lady jilt her\nlover? Not because she doesn't like him. She's just as fond of him as\never.\"\n\n\"He's a stupid sort of a fellow, and I think she was quite right,\"\nsaid Lizzie. \"I'd never marry a man merely because I said I would. If\nI found I didn't like him, I'd leave him at the altar. If I found I\ndidn't like him, I'd leave him even after the altar. I'd leave him\nany time I found I didn't like him. It's all very well to talk of\naroma, but to live with a man you don't like--is the devil!\"\n\n\"My dear, those whom God has joined together shouldn't be\nseparated,--for any mere likings or dislikings.\" This Mrs. Carbuncle\nsaid in a high tone of moral feeling, just as the carriage stopped\nat the door in Hertford Street. They at once perceived that the\nhall-door was open, and Mrs. Carbuncle, as she crossed the pavement,\nsaw that there were two policemen in the hall. The footman had\nbeen with them to the theatre, but the cook and housemaid, and Mrs.\nCarbuncle's own maid, were with the policemen in the passage. She\ngave a little scream, and then Lizzie, who had followed her, seized\nher by the arm. She turned round and saw by the gas-light that\nLizzie's face was white as a sheet, and that all the lines of her\ncountenance were rigid and almost distorted. \"Then she does know all\nabout it!\" said Mrs. Carbuncle to herself. Lizzie didn't speak, but\nstill hung on to Mrs. Carbuncle's arm, and Lucinda, having seen how\nit was, was also supporting her. A policeman stepped forward and\ntouched his hat. He was not Bunfit;--neither was he Gager. Indeed,\nthough the ladies had not perceived the difference, he was not at all\nlike Bunfit or Gager. This man was dressed in a policeman's uniform,\nwhereas Bunfit and Gager always wore plain clothes. \"My lady,\" said\nthe policeman, addressing Mrs. Carbuncle, \"there's been a robbery\nhere.\"\n\n\"A robbery!\" ejaculated Mrs. Carbuncle.\n\n\"Yes, my lady. The servants all out,--all to one; and she's off.\nThey've taken jewels, and, no doubt, money, if there was any. They\ndon't mostly come unless they know what they comes for.\"\n\nWith a horrid spasm across her heart, which seemed ready to kill\nher, so sharp was the pain, Lizzie recovered the use of her legs and\nfollowed Mrs. Carbuncle into the dining-room. She had been hardly\nconscious of hearing; but she had heard, and it had seemed to her\nthat the robbery spoken of was something distinct from her own\naffair. The policemen did not speak of having found the diamonds. It\nwas of something lost that they spoke. She seated herself in a chair\nagainst the wall, but did not utter a word. \"We've been up-stairs,\nmy lady, and they've been in most of the rooms. There's a desk broke\nopen,\"--Lizzie gave an involuntary little scream;--\"Yes, mum, a\ndesk,\" continued the policeman turning to Lizzie, \"and a bureau, and\na dressing-case. What's gone your ladyship can tell when you sees.\nAnd one of the young women is off. It's she as done it.\" Then the\ncook explained. She and the housemaid, and Mrs. Carbuncle's lady's\nmaid, had just stepped out, only round the corner, to get a little\nair, leaving Patience Crabstick in charge of the house; and when they\ncame back, the area gate was locked against them, the front door was\nlocked, and finding themselves unable to get in after many knockings,\nthey had at last obtained the assistance of a policeman. He had got\ninto the place over the area gate, had opened the front door from\nwithin, and then the robbery had been discovered. It was afterwards\nfound that the servants had all gone out to what they called a\ntea-party, at a public-house in the neighbourhood, and that by\nprevious agreement Patience Crabstick had remained in charge. When\nthey came back Patience Crabstick was gone, and the desk, and bureau,\nand dressing-case, were found to have been opened. \"She had a reg'lar\nthief along with her, my lady,\" said the policeman, still addressing\nhimself to Mrs. Carbuncle,--\"'cause of the way the things was\nopened.\"\n\n\"I always knew that young woman was downright bad,\" said Mrs.\nCarbuncle in her first expression of wrath.\n\nBut Lizzie sat in her chair without saying a word, still pale, with\nthat almost awful look of agony in her face. Within ten minutes\nof their entering the house, Mrs. Carbuncle was making her way\nup-stairs, with the two policemen following her. That her bureau and\nher dressing-case should have been opened was dreadful to her, though\nthe value that she could thus lose was very small. She also possessed\ndiamonds,--but her diamonds were paste; and whatever jewellery she\nhad of any value,--a few rings, and a brooch, and such like,--had\nbeen on her person in the theatre. What little money she had by her\nwas in the drawing-room, and the drawing-room, as it seemed, had not\nbeen entered. In truth, all Mrs. Carbuncle's possessions in the house\nwere not sufficient to have tempted a well-bred, well-instructed\nthief. But it behoved her to be indignant; and she could be indignant\nwith grace, as the thief was discovered to be, not her maid, but\nPatience Crabstick. The policemen followed Mrs. Carbuncle, and the\nmaids followed the policemen; but Lizzie Eustace kept her seat in\nthe chair by the wall. \"Do you think they have taken much of yours?\"\nsaid Lucinda, coming up to her and speaking very gently. Lizzie\nmade a motion with her two hands upon her heart, and struggled, and\ngasped,--as though she wished to speak but could not. \"I suppose it\nis that girl who has done it all,\" said Lucinda. Lizzie nodded her\nhead, and tried to smile. The attempt was so ghastly that Lucinda,\nthough not timid by nature, was frightened. She sat down and took\nLizzie's hand, and tried to comfort her. \"It is very hard upon you,\"\nshe said, \"to be twice robbed.\" Lizzie again nodded her head. \"I hope\nit is not much now. Shall we go up and see?\" The poor creature did\nget upon her legs, but she gasped so terribly that Lucinda feared\nthat she was dying. \"Shall I send for some one?\" she said. Lizzie\nmade an effort to speak, was shaken convulsively while the other\nsupported her, and then burst into a flood of tears.\n\nWhen that had come she was relieved, and could again act her part.\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"we will go with them. It is so dreadful;--is it\nnot?\"\n\n\"Very dreadful;--but how much better that we weren't at home! Shall\nwe go now?\" Then together they followed the others, and on the stairs\nLizzie explained that in her desk, of which she always carried\nthe key round her neck, there was what money she had by her;--two\nten-pound notes, and four five-pound notes, and three sovereigns;--in\nall, forty-three pounds. Her other jewels,--the jewels which she had\npossessed over and above the fatal diamond necklace,--were in her\ndressing-case. Patience, she did not doubt, had known that the money\nwas there, and certainly knew of her jewels. So they went up-stairs.\nThe desk was open and the money gone. Five or six rings and a\nbracelet had been taken also from Lizzie's dressing-case, which she\nhad left open. Of Mrs. Carbuncle's property sufficient had been\nstolen to make a long list in that lady's handwriting. Lucinda\nRoanoke's room had not been entered,--as far as they could judge.\nThe girl had taken the best of her own clothes, and a pair of strong\nboots belonging to the cook. A superintendent of police was there\nbefore they went to bed, and a list was made out. The superintendent\nwas of opinion that the thing had been done very cleverly, but was\nof opinion that the thieves had expected to find more plunder. \"They\ndon't care so much about banknotes, my lady, because they fetches\nsuch a low price with them as they deal with. The three sovereigns is\nmore to them than all the forty pounds in notes.\" The superintendent\nhad heard of the diamond necklace, and expressed an opinion that poor\nLady Eustace was especially marked out for misfortune. \"It all comes\nof having such a girl as that about her,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle. The\nsuperintendent, who intended to be consolatory to Lizzie, expressed\nhis opinion that it was very hard to know what a young woman was.\n\"They looks as soft as butter, and they're as sly as foxes, and as\nquick, as quick--as quick as greased lightning, my lady.\" Such a\npiece of business as this which had just occurred, will make people\nintimate at a very short notice.\n\nAnd so the diamond necklace, known to be worth ten thousand pounds,\nhad at last been stolen in earnest! Lizzie, when the policemen were\ngone, and the noise was over, and the house was closed, slunk away to\nher bedroom, refusing any aid in lieu of that of the wicked Patience.\nShe herself had examined the desk beneath the eyes of her two friends\nand of the policemen, and had seen at once that the case was gone.\nThe money was gone too, as she was rejoiced to find. She perceived\nat once that had the money been left,--the very leaving of it would\nhave gone to prove that other prize had been there. But the money was\ngone,--money of which she had given a correct account;--and she could\nnow honestly allege that she had been robbed. But she had at last\nreally lost her great treasure;--and if the treasure should be found,\nthen would she infallibly be exposed. She had talked twice of giving\naway her necklace, and had seriously thought of getting rid of it by\nburying it deep in the sea. But now that it was in very truth gone\nfrom her, the loss of it was horrible to her. Ten thousand pounds,\nfor which she had struggled so much and borne so many things, which\nhad come to be the prevailing fact of her life, gone from her for\never! Nevertheless it was not that sorrow, that regret, which had\nso nearly overpowered her in the dining-parlour. At that moment she\nhardly knew, had hardly thought, whether the diamonds had or had\nnot been taken. But the feeling came upon her at once that her own\ndisgrace was every hour being brought nearer to her. Her secret was\nno longer quite her own. One man knew it, and he had talked to her of\nperjury and of five years' imprisonment. Patience must have known it,\ntoo; and now some one else also knew it. The police, of course, would\nfind it out, and then horrid words would be used against her. She\nhardly knew what perjury was. It sounded like forgery and burglary.\nTo stand up before a judge and be tried,--and then to be locked up\nfor five years in prison--! What an end would this be to all her\nglorious success? And what evil had she done to merit all this\nterrible punishment? When they came to her in her bedroom at Carlisle\nshe had simply been too much frightened to tell them all that the\nnecklace was at that moment under her pillow.\n\nShe tried to think of it all, and to form some idea in her mind of\nwhat might be the truth. Of course, Patience Crabstick had known her\nsecret, but how long had the girl known it? And how had the girl\ndiscovered it? She was almost certain, from certain circumstances,\nfrom words which the girl had spoken, and from signs which she had\nobserved, that Patience had not even suspected that the necklace had\nbeen brought with them from Carlisle to London. Of course, the coming\nof Bunfit and the woman would have set the girl's mind to work in\nthat direction; but then Bunfit and the woman had only been there on\nthat morning. The Corsair knew the facts, and no one but the Corsair.\nThat the Corsair was a Corsair, the suspicions of the police had\nproved to her. She had offered the necklace to the Corsair; but when\nso offered, he had refused to take it. She could understand that he\nshould see the danger of accepting the diamonds from her hand, and\nyet should be desirous of having them. And might not he have thought\nthat he could best relieve her from the burthen of their custody in\nthis manner? She felt no anger against the Corsair as she weighed\nthe probability of his having taken them in this fashion. A Corsair\nmust be a Corsair. Were he to come to her and confess the deed, she\nwould almost like him the better for it,--admiring his skill and\nenterprise. But how very clever he must have been, and how brave!\nHe had known, no doubt, that the three ladies were all going to the\ntheatre; but in how short a time had he got rid of the other women\nand availed himself of the services of Patience Crabstick!\n\nBut in what way would she conduct herself when the police should come\nto her on the following morning,--the police and all the other people\nwho would crowd to the house? How should she receive her cousin\nFrank? How should she look when the coincidence of the double robbery\nshould be spoken of in her hearing? How should she bear herself when,\nas of course would be the case, she should again be taken before the\nmagistrates, and made to swear as to the loss of her property? Must\nshe commit more perjury, with the certainty that various people must\nknow that her oath was false? All the world would suspect her. All\nthe world would soon know the truth. Might it not be possible that\nthe diamonds were at this moment in the hands of Messrs. Camperdown,\nand that they would be produced before her eyes, as soon as her\nsecond false oath had been registered against her? And yet how could\nshe tell the truth? And what would the Corsair think of her,--the\nCorsair, who would know everything? She made one resolution during\nthe night. She would not be taken into court. The magistrates and\nthe people might come to her, but she would not go before them. When\nthe morning came she said that she was ill, and refused to leave her\nbed. Policemen, she knew, were in the house early. At about nine Mrs.\nCarbuncle and Lucinda were up and in her room. The excitement of the\naffair had taken them from their beds,--but she would not stir. If it\nwere absolutely necessary, she said, the men must come into her room.\nShe had been so overset by what had occurred on the previous night,\nthat she could not leave her room. She appealed to Lucinda as to the\nfact of her illness. The trouble of these robberies was so great\nupon her that her heart was almost broken. If her deposition must\nbe taken, she would make it in bed. In the course of the day the\nmagistrate did come into her room and the deposition was taken.\nForty-three pounds had been taken from her desk, and certain jewels,\nwhich she described, from her dressing-case. As far as she was aware,\nno other property of hers was missing. This she said in answer to a\ndirect question from the magistrate, which, as she thought, was asked\nwith a stern voice and searching eye. And so, a second time, she had\nsworn falsely. But this at least was gained,--that Lord George de\nBruce Carruthers was not looking at her as she swore.\n\nLord George was in the house for a great part of the day, but he did\nnot ask to be admitted to Lizzie's room;--nor did she ask to see him.\nFrank Greystock was there late in the afternoon, and went up at once\nto his cousin. The moment that she saw him she stretched out her arms\nto him, and burst into tears. \"My poor girl,\" said he, \"what is the\nmeaning of it all?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I think they will kill me. They want to kill me. How\ncan I bear it all? The robbers were here last night, and magistrates\nand policemen and people have been here all day.\" Then she fell\ninto a fit of sobbing and wailing, which was, in truth, hysterical.\nFor,--if the readers think of it,--the poor woman had a great deal to\nbear.\n\nFrank, into whose mind no glimmer of suspicion against his cousin had\nyet entered, and who firmly believed that she had been made a victim\nbecause of the value of her diamonds,--and who had a theory of his\nown about the robbery at Carlisle, to the circumstances of which he\nwas now at some pains to make these latter circumstances adhere,--was\nvery tender with his cousin, and remained in the house for more than\nan hour. \"Oh, Frank, what had I better do?\" she asked him.\n\n\"I would leave London, if I were you.\"\n\n\"Yes;--of course. I will. Oh yes, I will!\"\n\n\"If you don't fear the cold of Scotland--\"\n\n\"I fear nothing,--nothing but being where these policemen can come to\nme. Oh!\"--and then she shuddered and was again hysterical. Nor was\nshe acting the condition. As she remembered the magistrates, and the\ndetectives, and the policemen in their uniforms,--and reflected that\nshe might probably see much more of them before the game was played\nout, the thoughts that crowded on her were almost more than she could\nbear.\n\n\"Your child is there, and it is your own house. Go there till all\nthis passes by.\" Whereupon she promised him that, as soon as she was\nwell enough, she would at once go to Scotland.\n\nIn the meantime, the Eustace diamonds were locked up in a small\nsafe fixed into the wall at the back of a small cellar beneath the\nestablishment of Messrs. Harter and Benjamin, in Minto Lane, in\nthe City. Messrs. Harter and Benjamin always kept a second place\nof business. Their great shop was at the West-end; but they had\naccommodation in the City.\n\nThe chronicler states this at once, as he scorns to keep from his\nreader any secret that is known to himself.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIII\n\nLizzie's Sick-Room\n\n\nWhen the Hertford Street robbery was three days old, and was still\nthe talk of all the town, Lizzie Eustace was really ill. She had\npromised to go down to Scotland in compliance with the advice given\nto her by her cousin Frank, and at the moment of promising would have\nbeen willing enough to be transported at once to Portray, had that\nbeen possible--so as to be beyond the visits of policemen and the\nauthority of lawyers and magistrates; but as the hours passed over\nher head, and as her presence of mind returned to her, she remembered\nthat even at Portray she would not be out of danger, and that she\ncould do nothing in furtherance of her plans if once immured there.\nLord George was in London, Frank Greystock was in London, and Lord\nFawn was in London. It was more than ever necessary to her that she\nshould find a husband among them,--a husband who would not be less\nher husband when the truth of that business at Carlisle should\nbe known to all the world. She had, in fact, stolen nothing. She\nendeavoured to comfort herself by repeating to herself over and over\nagain that assurance. She had stolen nothing; and she still thought\nthat if she could obtain the support of some strong arm on which to\nlean, she might escape punishment for those false oaths which she had\nsworn. Her husband might take her abroad, and the whole thing would\ndie away. If she should succeed with Lord George, of course he would\ntake her abroad, and there would be no need for any speedy return.\nThey might roam among islands in pleasant warm suns, and the dreams\nof her youth might be realised. Her income was still her own. They\ncould not touch that. So she thought, at least,--oppressed by some\nslight want of assurance in that respect. Were she to go at once to\nScotland, she must for the present give up that game altogether. If\nFrank would pledge himself to become her husband in three or four,\nor even in six months, she would go at once. She had more confidence\nin Frank than even in Lord George. As for love,--she would sometimes\ntell herself that she was violently in love; but she hardly knew with\nwhich. Lord George was certainly the best representative of that\nperfect Corsair which her dreams had represented to her; but, in\nregard to working life, she thought that she liked her cousin Frank\nbetter than she had ever yet liked any other human being. But, in\ntruth, she was now in that condition, as she acknowledged to herself,\nthat she was hardly entitled to choose. Lord Fawn had promised to\nmarry her, and to him as a husband she conceived that she still had a\nright. Nothing had as yet been proved against her which could justify\nhim in repudiating his engagement. She had, no doubt, asserted with\nall vehemence to her cousin that no consideration would now induce\nher to give her hand to Lord Fawn;--and when making that assurance\nshe had been, after her nature, sincere. But circumstances were\nchanged since that. She had not much hope that Lord Fawn might be\nmade to succumb,--though evidence had reached her before the last\nrobbery which induced her to believe that he did not consider himself\nto be quite secure. In these circumstances she was unwilling to leave\nLondon though she had promised, and was hardly sorry to find an\nexcuse in her recognised illness.\n\nAnd she was ill. Though her mind was again at work with schemes on\nwhich she would not have busied herself without hope, yet she had not\nrecovered from the actual bodily prostration to which she had been\ncompelled to give way when first told of the robbery on her return\nfrom the theatre. There had been moments then in which she thought\nthat her heart would have broken,--moments in which, but that the\npower of speech was wanting, she would have told everything to\nLucinda Roanoke. When Mrs. Carbuncle was marching up-stairs with the\npolicemen at her heels she would have willingly sold all her hopes,\nPortray Castle, her lovers, her necklace, her income, her beauty,\nfor any assurance of the humblest security. With that quickness of\nintellect which was her peculiar gift, she had soon understood, in\nthe midst of her sufferings, that her necklace had been taken by\nthieves whose robbery might assist her for a while in keeping her\nsecret, rather than lead to the immediate divulging of it. Neither\nCamperdown nor Bunfit had been at work among the boxes. Her secret\nhad been discovered, no doubt, by Patience Crabstick, and the\ndiamonds were gone. But money also was taken, and the world need not\nknow that the diamonds had been there. But Lord George knew. And then\nthere arose to her that question: Had the diamonds been taken in\nconsequence of that revelation to Lord George? It was not surprising\nthat in the midst of all this Lizzie should be really ill.\n\nShe was most anxious to see Lord George; but, if what Mrs. Carbuncle\nsaid to her was true, Lord George refused to see her. She did\nnot believe Mrs. Carbuncle, and was, therefore, quite in the\ndark about her Corsair. As she could only communicate with him\nthrough Mrs. Carbuncle, it might well be the case that he should\nhave been told that he could not have access to her. Of course\nthere were difficulties. That her cousin Frank should see her\nin her bedroom,--her cousin Frank, with whom it was essentially\nnecessary that she should hold counsel as to her present great\ndifficulties,--was a matter of course. There was no hesitation about\nthat. A fresh nightcap, and a clean pocket-handkerchief with a bit of\nlace round it, and, perhaps, some pretty covering to her shoulders if\nshe were to be required to sit up in bed, and the thing was arranged.\nHe might have spent the best part of his days in her bedroom if he\ncould have spared the time. But the Corsair was not a cousin,--nor\nas yet an acknowledged lover. There was difficulty even in framing a\nreason for her request, when she made it to Mrs. Carbuncle; and the\nvery reason which she gave was handed back to her as the Corsair's\nreason for not coming to her. She desired to see him because he had\nbeen so much mixed up in the matter of these terrible robberies. But\nMrs. Carbuncle declared to her that Lord George would not come to her\nbecause his name had been so frequently mentioned in connexion with\nthe diamonds. \"You see, my dear,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle, \"there can be\nno real reason for his seeing you up in your bedroom. If there had\nbeen anything between you, as I once thought there would--\" There\nwas something in the tone of Mrs. Carbuncle's voice which grated on\nLizzie's ear,--something which seemed to imply that all that prospect\nwas over.\n\n\"Of course,\" said Lizzie querulously, \"I am very anxious to know what\nhe thinks. I care more about his opinion than anybody else's. As to\nhis name being mixed up in it,--that is all a joke.\"\n\n\"It has been no joke to him, I can assure you,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle.\nLizzie could not press her request. Of course, she knew more about it\nthan did Mrs. Carbuncle. The secret was in her own bosom,--the secret\nas to the midnight robbery at Carlisle, and that secret she had told\nto Lord George. As to the robbery in London she knew nothing,--except\nthat it had been perpetrated through the treachery of Patience\nCrabstick. Did Lord George know more about it than she knew?--and if\nso, was he now deterred by that knowledge from visiting her? \"You\nsee, my dear,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle, \"that a gentleman visiting a lady\nwith whom he has no connexion, in her bedroom, is in itself something\nvery peculiar.\" Lizzie made a motion of impatience under the\nbedclothes. Any such argument was trash to her, and she knew that it\nwas trash to Mrs. Carbuncle also. What was one man in her bedroom\nmore than another? She could see a dozen doctors if she pleased, and\nif so, why not this man, whose real powers of doctoring her would be\nso much more efficacious? \"You would want to see him alone, too,\"\ncontinued Mrs. Carbuncle, \"and, of course, the police would hear of\nit. I am not at all surprised that he should stay away.\" Lizzie's\ncondition did not admit of much argument on her side, and she only\nshowed her opposition to Mrs. Carbuncle by being cross and querulous.\n\nFrank Greystock came to her with great constancy almost every day,\nand from him she did hear about the robbery all that he knew or\nheard. When three days had passed,--when six days, and even when\nten days were gone, nobody had been as yet arrested. The police,\naccording to Frank, were much on the alert, but were very secret.\nThey either would not, or could not, tell anything. To him the two\nrobberies, that at Carlisle and the last affair in Hertford Street,\nwere of course distinct. There were those who believed that the\nHertford Street thieves and the Carlisle thieves were not only the\nsame, but that they had been in quest of the same plunder,--and had\nat last succeeded. But Frank was not one of these. He never for a\nmoment doubted that the diamonds had been taken at Carlisle, and\nexplained the second robbery by the supposition that Patience\nCrabstick had been emboldened by success. The iron box had no doubt\nbeen taken by her assistance, and her familiarity with the thieves,\nthen established, had led to the second robbery. Lizzie's loss in\nthat second robbery had amounted to some hundred pounds. This was\nFrank Greystock's theory, and of course it was one very comfortable\nto Lizzie.\n\n\"They all seem to think that the diamonds are at Paris,\" he said to\nher one day.\n\n\"If you only knew how little I care about them. It seems as though I\nhad almost forgotten them in these after troubles.\"\n\n\"Mr. Camperdown cares about them. I'm told he says that he can make\nyou pay for them out of your jointure.\"\n\n\"That would be very terrible, of course,\" said Lizzie, to whose mind\nthere was something consolatory in the idea that the whole affair of\nthe robbery might perhaps remain so mysterious as to remove her from\nthe danger of other punishment than this.\n\n\"I feel sure that he couldn't do it,\" said Frank, \"and I don't think\nhe'll try it. John Eustace would not let him. It would be\npersecution.\"\n\n\"Mr. Camperdown has always chosen to persecute me,\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"I can understand that he shouldn't like the loss of the diamonds. I\ndon't think, Lizzie, you ever realised their true value.\"\n\n\"I suppose not. After all, a necklace is only a necklace. I cared\nnothing for it,--except that I could not bear the idea that that\nman should dictate to me. I would have given it up at once, at the\nslightest word from you.\" He did not care to remind her then, as\nshe lay in bed, that he had been very urgent in his advice to her\nto abandon the diamonds,--and not the less urgent because he had\nthought that the demand for them was unjust. \"I told you often,\" she\ncontinued, \"that I was tempted to throw them among the waves. It was\ntrue;--quite true. I offered to give them to you, and should have\nbeen delighted to have been relieved from them.\"\n\n\"That was, of course, simply impossible.\"\n\n\"I know it was;--impossible on your part; but I would have been\ndelighted. Of what use were they to me? I wore them twice because\nthat man,\"--meaning Lord Fawn,--\"disputed my right to them. Before\nthat I never even looked at them. Do you think I had pleasure in\nwearing them, or pleasure in looking at them? Never. They were only a\ntrouble to me. It was a point of honour with me to keep them, because\nI was attacked. But I am glad they are gone,--thoroughly glad.\" This\nwas all very well, and was not without its effect on Frank Greystock.\nIt is hardly expected of a woman in such a condition, with so many\ntroubles on her mind, who had been so persecuted, that every word\nuttered by her should be strictly true. Lizzie, with her fresh\nnightcap, and her laced handkerchief, pale, and with her eyes just\nglittering with tears, was very pretty. \"Didn't somebody once give\nsome one a garment which scorched him up when he wore it,--some woman\nwho sent it because she loved the man so much?\"\n\n\"The shirt, you mean, which Dejanira sent to Hercules. Yes;--Hercules\nwas a good deal scorched.\"\n\n\"And that necklace, which my husband gave me because he loved me so\nwell, has scorched me horribly. It has nearly killed me. It has been\nlike the white elephant which the Eastern king gives to his subject\nwhen he means to ruin him. Only poor Florian didn't mean to hurt me.\nHe gave it all in love. If these people bring a lawsuit against me,\nFrank, you must manage it for me.\"\n\n\"There will be no lawsuit. Your brother-in-law will stop it.\"\n\n\"I wonder who will really get the diamonds after all, Frank? They\nwere very valuable. Only think that the ten thousand pounds should\ndisappear in such a way!\" The subject was a very dangerous one, but\nthere was a fascination about it which made it impossible for her to\nrefrain from it.\n\n\"A dishonest dealer in diamonds will probably realise the\nplunder,--after some years. There would be something very alluring\nin the theft of articles of great value, were it not that, when got,\nthey at once become almost valueless by the difficulty of dealing\nwith them. Supposing I had the necklace!\"\n\n\"I wish you had, Frank.\"\n\n\"I could do nothing with it. Ten sovereigns would go further with\nme,--or ten shillings. The burthen of possessing it would in itself\nbe almost more than I could bear. The knowledge that I had the thing,\nand might be discovered in having it, would drive me mad. By my own\nweakness I should be compelled to tell my secret to some one. And\nthen I should never sleep for fear my partner in the matter should\nturn against me.\" How well she understood it all! How probable it\nwas that Lord George should turn against her! How exact was Frank's\ndescription of that burthen of a secret so heavy that it cannot be\nborne alone! \"A little reflection,\" continued Frank, \"soon convinces\na man that rough downright stealing is an awkward, foolish trade; and\nit therefore falls into the hands of those who want education for\nthe higher efforts of dishonesty. To get into a bank at midnight and\nsteal what little there may be in the till, or even an armful of\nbank-notes, with the probability of a policeman catching you as you\ncreep out of the chimney and through a hole, is clumsy work; but to\nwalk in amidst the smiles and bows of admiring managers and draw out\nmoney over the counter by thousands and tens of thousands, which you\nhave never put in and which you can never repay, and which, when all\nis done, you have only borrowed;--that is a great feat.\"\n\n\"Do you really think so?\"\n\n\"The courage, the ingenuity, and the self-confidence needed are\ncertainly admirable. And then there is a cringing and almost\ncontemptible littleness about honesty, which hardly allows it to\nassert itself. The really honest man can never say a word to make\nthose who don't know of his honesty believe that it is there. He has\none foot in the grave before his neighbours have learned that he is\npossessed of an article for the use of which they would so willingly\nhave paid, could they have been made to see that it was there. The\ndishonest man almost doubts whether in him dishonesty is dishonest,\nlet it be practised ever so widely. The honest man almost doubts\nwhether his honesty be honest, unless it be kept hidden. Let two\nunknown men be competitors for any place, with nothing to guide the\njudges but their own words and their own looks, and who can doubt but\nthe dishonest man would be chosen rather than the honest? Honesty\ngoes about with a hang-dog look about him, as though knowing that\nhe cannot be trusted till he be proved. Dishonesty carries his eyes\nhigh, and assumes that any question respecting him must be considered\nto be unnecessary.\"\n\n\"Oh, Frank, what a philosopher you are.\"\n\n\"Well, yes; meditating about your diamonds has brought my philosophy\nout. When do you think you will go to Scotland?\"\n\n\"I am hardly strong enough for the journey yet. I fear the cold so\nmuch.\"\n\n\"You would not find it cold there by the sea-side. To tell you the\ntruth, Lizzie, I want to get you out of this house. I don't mean to\nsay a word against Mrs. Carbuncle; but after all that has occurred,\nit would be better that you should be away. People talk about you and\nLord George.\"\n\n\"How can I help it, Frank?\"\n\n\"By going away;--that is, if I may presume one thing. I don't want to\npry into your secrets.\"\n\n\"I have none from you.\"\n\n\"Unless there be truth in the assertion that you are engaged to marry\nLord George Carruthers.\"\n\n\"There is no truth in it.\"\n\n\"And you do not wish to stay here in order that there may be an\nengagement? I am obliged to ask you home questions, Lizzie, as I\ncould not otherwise advise you.\"\n\n\"You do, indeed, ask home questions.\"\n\n\"I will desist at once, if they be disagreeable.\"\n\n\"Frank, you are false to me!\" As she said this she rose in her bed,\nand sat with her eyes fixed upon his, and her thin hands stretched\nout upon the bedclothes. \"You know that I cannot wish to be engaged\nto him or to any other man. You know, better almost than I can\nknow myself, how my heart stands. There has, at any rate, been no\nhypocrisy with me in regard to you. Everything has been told to\nyou;--at what cost I will not now say. The honest woman, I fear,\nfares worse even than the honest man of whom you spoke. I think you\nadmitted that he would be appreciated at last. She to her dying day\nmust pay the penalty of her transgressions. Honesty in a woman the\nworld never forgives.\" When she had done speaking, he sat silent by\nher bedside, but, almost unconsciously, he stretched out his left\nhand and took her right hand in his. For a few seconds she admitted\nthis, and she lay there with their hands clasped. Then with a start\nshe drew back her arm, and retreated as it were from his touch. \"How\ndare you,\" she said, \"press my hand, when you know that such pressure\nfrom you is treacherous and damnable!\"\n\n\"Damnable, Lizzie!\"\n\n\"Yes;--damnable. I will not pick my words for you. Coming from you,\nwhat does such pressure mean?\"\n\n\"Affection.\"\n\n\"Yes;--and of what sort? You are wicked enough to feed my love by\nsuch tokens, when you know that you do not mean to return it. Oh,\nFrank, Frank, will you give me back my heart? What was it that you\npromised me when we sat together upon the rocks at Portray?\"\n\nIt is inexpressibly difficult for a man to refuse the tender of a\nwoman's love. We may almost say that a man should do so as a matter\nof course,--that the thing so offered becomes absolutely valueless\nby the offer,--that the woman who can make it has put herself out\nof court by her own abandonment of the privileges due to her as a\nwoman,--that stern rebuke and even expressed contempt are justified\nby such conduct,--and that the fairest beauty and most alluring\ncharms of feminine grace should lose their attraction when thus\ntendered openly in the market. No doubt such is our theory as to love\nand love-making. But the action to be taken by us in matters as to\nwhich the plainest theory prevails for the guidance of our practice,\ndepends so frequently on accompanying circumstances and correlative\nissues, that the theory, as often as not, falls to the ground. Frank\ncould not despise this woman, and could not be stern to her. He could\nnot bring himself to tell her boldly that he would have nothing to\nsay to her in the way of love. He made excuses for her, and persuaded\nhimself that there were peculiar circumstances in her position\njustifying unwomanly conduct, although, had he examined himself on\nthe subject, he would have found it difficult to say what those\ncircumstances were. She was rich, beautiful, clever,--and he was\nflattered. Nevertheless he knew that he could not marry her;--and he\nknew also that much as he liked her he did not love her. \"Lizzie,\" he\nsaid, \"I think you hardly understand my position.\"\n\n\"Yes, I do. That little girl has cozened you out of a promise.\"\n\n\"If it be so, you would not have me break it.\"\n\n\"Yes, I would, if you think she is not fit to be your wife. Is a\nman such as you are, to be tied by the leg for life, have all his\nambition clipped, and his high hopes shipwrecked, because a girl has\nbeen clever enough to extract a word from him? Is it not true that\nyou are in debt?\"\n\n\"What of that? At any rate, Lizzie, I do not want help from you.\"\n\n\"That is so like a man's pride! Do we not all know that in such a\ncareer as you have marked out for yourself, wealth, or at any rate an\neasy income, is necessary? Do you think that I cannot put two and two\ntogether? Do you believe so meanly of me as to imagine that I should\nhave said to you what I have said, if I did not know that I could\nhelp you? A man, I believe, cannot understand that love which induces\na woman to sacrifice her pride simply for his advantage. I want to\nsee you prosper. I want to see you a great man and a lord, and I know\nthat you cannot become so without an income. Ah, I wish I could give\nyou all that I have got, and save you from the encumbrance that is\nattached to it!\"\n\nIt might be that he would then have told her of his engagement to\nLucy, and of his resolution to adhere to that promise, had not Mrs.\nCarbuncle at that moment entered the room. Frank had been there for\nabove an hour, and as Lizzie was still an invalid, and to some extent\nunder the care of Mrs. Carbuncle, it was natural that that lady\nshould interfere. \"You know, my dear, you should not exhaust yourself\naltogether. Mr. Emilius is to come to you this afternoon.\"\n\n\"Mr. Emilius!\" said Greystock.\n\n\"Yes;--the clergyman. Don't you remember him at Portray? A dark man\nwith eyes close together! You used to be very wicked, and say that\nhe was once a Jew-boy in the streets.\" Lizzie, as she spoke of her\nspiritual guide, was evidently not desirous of doing him much honour.\n\n\"I remember him well enough. He made sheep's eyes at Miss Macnulty,\nand drank a great deal of wine at dinner.\"\n\n\"Poor Macnulty! I don't believe a word about the wine; and as for\nMacnulty, I don't see why she should not be converted as well as\nanother. He is coming here to read to me. I hope you don't object.\"\n\n\"Not in the least;--if you like it.\"\n\n\"One does have solemn thoughts sometimes, Frank,--especially when one\nis ill.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. Well or ill, one does have solemn thoughts;--ghosts, as\nit were, which will appear. But is Mr. Emilius good at laying such\napparitions?\"\n\n\"He is a clergyman, Mr. Greystock,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle, with\nsomething of rebuke in her voice.\n\n\"So they tell me. I was not present at his ordination, but I daresay\nit was done according to rule. When one reflects what a deal of harm\na bishop may do, one wishes that there was some surer way of getting\nbishops.\"\n\n\"Do you know anything against Mr. Emilius?\" asked Lizzie.\n\n\"Nothing at all but his looks, and manners, and voice,--unless it be\nthat he preaches popular sermons, and drinks too much wine, and makes\nsheep's eyes at Miss Macnulty. Look after your silver spoons, Mrs.\nCarbuncle,--if the last thieves have left you any. You were asking\nafter the fate of your diamonds, Lizzie. Perhaps they will endow a\nProtestant church in Mr. Emilius's native land.\"\n\nMr. Emilius did come and read to Lady Eustace that afternoon. A\nclergyman is as privileged to enter the bedroom of a sick lady as is\na doctor or a cousin. There was another clean cap, and another laced\nhandkerchief, and on this occasion a little shawl over Lizzie's\nshoulders. Mr. Emilius first said a prayer, kneeling at Lizzie's\nbedside; then he read a chapter in the Bible;--and after that he read\nthe first half of the fourth canto of Childe Harold so well, that\nLizzie felt for the moment that after all, poetry was life and life\nwas poetry.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIV\n\n\"I Suppose I May Say a Word\"\n\n\nThe second robbery to which Lady Eustace had been subjected by no\nmeans decreased the interest which was attached to her and her\nconcerns in the fashionable world. Parliament had now met, and the\nparty at Matching Priory,--Lady Glencora Palliser's party in the\ncountry,--had been to some extent broken up. All those gentlemen\nwho were engaged in the service of Her Majesty's Government had\nnecessarily gone to London, and they who had wives at Matching had\ntaken their wives with them. Mr. and Mrs. Bonteen had seen the last\nof their holiday; Mr. Palliser himself was, of course, at his post;\nand all the private secretaries were with the public secretaries\non the scene of action. On the 13th of February Mr. Palliser made\nhis first great statement in Parliament on the matter of the\nfive-farthinged penny, and pledged himself to do his very best to\ncarry that stupendous measure through Parliament in the present\nsession. The City men who were in the House that night,--and all\nthe Directors of the Bank of England were in the gallery, and every\nchairman of a great banking company, and every Baring and every\nRothschild, if there be Barings and Rothschilds who have not been\nreturned by constituencies, and have not seats in the House by\nright,--agreed in declaring that the job in hand was too much for any\none member or any one session. Some said that such a measure never\ncould be passed, because the unfinished work of one session could\nnot be used in lessening the labours of the next. Everything must be\nrecommenced; and therefore,--so said these hopeless ones,--the penny\nwith five farthings, the penny of which a hundred would make ten\nshillings, the halcyon penny, which would make all future pecuniary\ncalculations easy to the meanest British capacity, could never become\nthe law of the land. Others, more hopeful, were willing to believe\nthat gradually the thing would so sink into the minds of members of\nParliament, of writers of leading articles, and of the active public\ngenerally, as to admit of certain established axioms being taken as\nestablished, and placed, as it were, beyond the procrastinating power\nof debate. It might, for instance, at last be taken for granted that\na decimal system was desirable,--so that a month or two of the spring\nneed not be consumed on that preliminary question. But this period\nhad not as yet been reached, and it was thought by the entire City\nthat Mr. Palliser was much too sanguine. It was so probable, many\nsaid, that he might kill himself by labour which would be Herculean\nin all but success, and that no financier after him would venture to\nface the task. It behoved Lady Glencora to see that her Hercules did\nnot kill himself.\n\nIn this state of affairs Lady Glencora,--into whose hands the custody\nof Mr. Palliser's uncle, the duke, had now altogether fallen,--had\na divided duty between Matching and London. When the members of\nParliament went up to London, she went there also, leaving some\nhalf-dozen friends whom she could trust to amuse the duke; but she\nsoon returned, knowing that there might be danger in a long absence.\nThe duke, though old, was his own master; he much affected the\ncompany of Madame Goesler, and that lady's kindness to him was\nconsiderate and incessant; but there might still be danger, and Lady\nGlencora felt that she was responsible that the old nobleman should\ndo nothing, in the feebleness of age, to derogate from the splendour\nof his past life. What if some day his grace should be off to Paris\nand insist on making Madame Goesler a duchess in the chapel of the\nEmbassy! Madame Goesler had hitherto behaved very well;--would\nprobably continue to behave well. Lady Glencora really loved Madame\nGoesler. But then the interests at stake were very great! So\ncircumstanced, Lady Glencora found herself compelled to be often on\nthe road between Matching and London.\n\nBut though she was burthened with great care, Lady Glencora by no\nmeans dropped her interest in the Eustace diamonds; and when she\nlearned that on the top of the great Carlisle robbery a second\nrobbery had been superadded, and that this had been achieved while\nall the London police were yet astray about the former operation, her\nsolicitude was of course enhanced. The duke himself, too, took the\nmatter up so strongly, that he almost wanted to be carried up to\nLondon, with some view, as it was supposed by the ladies who were\nso good to him, of seeing Lady Eustace personally. \"It's out of the\nquestion, my dear,\" Lady Glencora said to Madame Goesler, when the\nduke's fancy was first mentioned to her by that lady. \"I told him\nthat the trouble would be too much for him.\" \"Of course it would be\ntoo much,\" said Lady Glencora. \"It is quite out of the question.\"\nThen, after a moment, she added in a whisper, \"Who knows but what\nhe'd insist on marrying her! It isn't every woman that can resist\ntemptation.\" Madame Goesler smiled, and shook her head, but made\nno answer to Lady Glencora's suggestion. Lady Glencora assured her\nuncle that everything should be told to him. She would write about it\ndaily, and send him the latest news by the wires if the post should\nbe too slow. \"Ah;--yes,\" said the duke; \"I like telegrams best. I\nthink, you know, that that Lord George Carruthers has had something\nto do with it. Don't you, Madame Goesler?\" It had long been evident\nthat the duke was anxious that one of his own order should be proved\nto have been the thief, as the plunder taken was so lordly.\n\nIn regard to Lizzie herself, Lady Glencora, on her return to London,\ntook it into her head to make a diversion in our heroine's favour. It\nhad hitherto been a matter of faith with all the Liberal party that\nLady Eustace had had something to do with stealing her own diamonds.\nThat esprit de corps which is the glorious characteristic of English\nstatesmen had caused the whole Government to support Lord Fawn, and\nLord Fawn could only be supported on the supposition that Lizzie\nEustace had been a wicked culprit. But Lady Glencora, though very\ntrue as a politician, was apt to have opinions of her own, and to\ntake certain flights in which she chose that others of the party\nshould follow her. She now expressed an opinion that Lady Eustace\nwas a victim, and all the Mrs. Bonteens, with some even of the Mr.\nBonteens, found themselves compelled to agree with her. She stood too\nhigh among her set to be subject to that obedience which restrained\nothers,--too high, also, for others to resist her leading. As a\nmember of a party she was erratic and dangerous, but from her\nposition and peculiar temperament she was powerful. When she declared\nthat poor Lady Eustace was a victim, others were obliged to say so\ntoo. This was particularly hard upon Lord Fawn, and the more so as\nLady Glencora took upon her to assert that Lord Fawn had no right\nto jilt the young woman. And Lady Glencora had this to support\nher views,--that, for the last week past, indeed ever since the\ndepositions which had been taken after the robbery in Hertford\nStreet, the police had expressed no fresh suspicions in regard to\nLizzie Eustace. She heard daily from Barrington Erle that Major\nMackintosh and Bunfit and Gager were as active as ever in their\ninquiries, that all Scotland Yard was determined to unravel the\nmystery, and that there were emissaries at work tracking the diamonds\nat Hamburg, Paris, Vienna, and New York. It had been whispered to Mr.\nErle that the whereabouts of Patience Crabstick had been discovered,\nand that many of the leading thieves in London were assisting the\npolice;--but nothing more was done in the way of fixing any guilt\nupon Lizzie Eustace. \"Upon my word, I am beginning to think that she\nhas been more sinned against than sinning.\" This was said to Lady\nGlencora on the morning after Mr. Palliser's great speech about the\nfive farthings, by Barrington Erle, who, as it seemed, had been\nspecially told off by the party to watch this investigation.\n\n\"I am sure she has had nothing to do with it. I have thought so ever\nsince the last robbery. Sir Simon Slope told me yesterday afternoon\nthat Mr. Camperdown has given it up altogether.\" Sir Simon Slope was\nthe Solicitor-General of that day.\n\n\"It would be absurd for him to go on with his bill in Chancery now\nthat the diamonds are gone,--unless he meant to make her pay for\nthem.\"\n\n\"That would be rank persecution. Indeed, she has been persecuted.\nI shall call upon her.\" Then she wrote the following letter to the\nduke:--\n\n\n   February 14, 18--.\n\n   MY DEAR DUKE,\n\n   Plantagenet was on his legs last night for three hours\n   and three quarters, and I sat through it all. As far as\n   I could observe through the bars I was the only person in\n   the House who listened to him. I'm sure Mr. Gresham was\n   fast asleep. It was quite piteous to see some of them\n   yawning. Plantagenet did it very well, and I almost think\n   I understood him. They seem to say that nobody on the\n   other side will take trouble enough to make a regular\n   opposition, but that there are men in the City who will\n   write letters to the newspapers, and get up a sort of Bank\n   clamour. Plantagenet says nothing about it, but there is\n   a do-or-die manner with him which is quite tragical. The\n   House was up at eleven, when he came home and eat three\n   oysters, drank a glass of beer, and slept well. They say\n   the real work will come when it's in Committee;--that is,\n   if it gets there. The bill is to be brought in, and will\n   be read the first time next Monday week.\n\n   As to the robberies, I believe there is no doubt that\n   the police have got hold of the young woman. They don't\n   arrest her, but deal with her in a friendly sort of way.\n   Barrington Erle says that a sergeant is to marry her in\n   order to make quite sure of her. I suppose they know their\n   business; but that wouldn't strike me as being the safest\n   way. They seem to think the diamonds went to Paris but\n   have since been sent on to New York.\n\n   As to the little widow, I do believe she has been made a\n   victim. She first lost her diamonds, and now her other\n   jewels and her money have gone. I cannot see what she was\n   to gain by treachery, and I think she has been ill-used.\n   She is staying at the house of that Mrs. Carbuncle, but\n   all the same I shall go and call on her. I wish you could\n   see her, because she is such a little beauty;--just what\n   you would like; not so much colour as our friend, but\n   perfect features, with infinite play,--not perhaps always\n   in the very best taste; but then we can't have everything;\n   can we, dear duke?\n\n   As to the real thief;--of course you must burn this at\n   once, and keep it strictly private as coming from me;--I\n   fancy that delightful Scotch lord managed it entirely.\n   The idea is, that he did it on commission for the Jew\n   jewellers. I don't suppose he had money enough to carry it\n   out himself. As to the second robbery, whether he had or\n   had not a hand in that, I can't make up my mind. I don't\n   see why he shouldn't. If a man does go into a business,\n   he ought to make the best of it. Of course, it was a poor\n   thing after the diamonds; but still it was worth having.\n   There is some story about a Sir Griffin Tewett. He's a\n   real Sir Griffin, as you'll find by the peerage. He was to\n   marry a young woman, and our Lord George insists that he\n   shall marry her. I don't understand all about it, but the\n   girl lives in the same house with Lady Eustace, and if I\n   call I shall find out. They say that Sir Griffin knows all\n   about the necklace, and threatens to tell unless he is let\n   off marrying. I rather think the girl is Lord George's\n   daughter, so that there is a thorough complication.\n\n   I shall go down to Matching on Saturday. If anything turns\n   up before that, I'll write again, or send a message. I\n   don't know whether Plantagenet will be able to leave\n   London. He says he must be back on Monday, and that he\n   loses too much time on the road. Kiss my little darlings\n   for me,--[the darlings were Lady Glencora's children, and\n   the duke's playthings]--and give my love to Madame Max. I\n   suppose you don't see much of the others.\n\n   Most affectionately yours,\n\n   GLENCORA.\n\n\nOn the next day Lady Glencora actually did call in Hertford Street,\nand saw our friend Lizzie. She was told by the servant that Lady\nEustace was in bed; but, with her usual persistence, she asked\nquestions, and when she found that Lizzie did receive visitors in her\nroom, she sent up her card. The compliment was one much too great\nto be refused. Lady Glencora stood so high in the world, that her\ncountenance would be almost as valuable as another lover. If Lord\nGeorge would keep her secret, and Lady Glencora would be her friend,\nmight she not still be a successful woman? So Lady Glencora Palliser\nwas shown up to Lizzie's chamber. Lizzie was found with her nicest\nnightcap and prettiest handkerchief, with a volume of Tennyson's\npoetry, and a scent-bottle. She knew that it behoved her to be\nvery clever at this interview. Her instinct told her that her\nfirst greeting should show more of surprise than of gratification.\nAccordingly, in a pretty, feminine, almost childish way, she was very\nmuch surprised. \"I'm doing the strangest thing in the world, I know,\nLady Eustace,\" said Lady Glencora with a smile.\n\n\"I'm sure you mean to do a kind thing.\"\n\n\"Well;--yes, I do. I think we have not met since you were at my house\nnear the end of last season.\"\n\n\"No, indeed. I have been in London six weeks, but have not been out\nmuch. For the last fortnight I have been in bed. I have had things to\ntrouble me so much that they have made me ill.\"\n\n\"So I have heard, Lady Eustace, and I have just come to offer you my\nsympathy. When I was told that you did see people, I thought that\nperhaps you would admit me.\"\n\n\"So willingly, Lady Glencora!\"\n\n\"I have heard, of course, of your terrible losses.\"\n\n\"The loss has been as nothing to the vexation that has accompanied\nit. I don't know how to speak of it. Ladies have lost their jewels\nbefore now, but I don't know that any lady before me has ever been\naccused of stealing them herself.\"\n\n\"There has been no accusation, surely?\"\n\n\"I haven't exactly been put in prison, Lady Glencora, but I have\nhad policemen here wanting to search my things;--and then you know\nyourself what reports have been spread.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; I do. Only for that, to tell you plainly, I should\nhardly have been here now.\" Then Lady Glencora poured out her\nsympathy,--perhaps with more eloquence and grace than discretion. She\nwas, at any rate, both graceful and eloquent. \"As for the loss of the\ndiamonds, I think you bear it wonderfully,\" said Lady Glencora.\n\n\"If you could imagine how little I care about it!\" said Lizzie with\nenthusiasm. \"They had lost the delight which I used to feel in them\nas a present from my husband. People had talked about them, and I had\nbeen threatened because I chose to keep what I knew to be my own. Of\ncourse, I would not give them up. Would you have given them up, Lady\nGlencora?\"\n\n\"Certainly not.\"\n\n\"Nor would I. But when once all that had begun, they became an\nirrepressible burthen to me. I often used to say that I would throw\nthem into the sea.\"\n\n\"I don't think I would have done that,\" said Lady Glencora.\n\n\"Ah,--you have never suffered as I have suffered.\"\n\n\"We never know where each other's shoes pinch each other's toes.\"\n\n\"You have never been left desolate. You have a husband and friends.\"\n\n\"A husband that wants to put five farthings into a penny! All is not\ngold that glistens, Lady Eustace.\"\n\n\"You can never have known trials such as mine,\" continued Lizzie, not\nunderstanding in the least her new friend's allusion to the great\ncurrency question. \"Perhaps you may have heard that in the course\nof last summer I became engaged to marry a nobleman, with whom I am\naware that you are acquainted.\" This she said in her softest whisper.\n\n\"Oh, yes;--Lord Fawn. I know him very well. Of course I heard of it.\nWe all heard of it.\"\n\n\"And you have heard how he has treated me?\"\n\n\"Yes,--indeed.\"\n\n\"I will say nothing about him--to you, Lady Glencora. It would not\nbe proper that I should do so. But all that came of this wretched\nnecklace. After that, can you wonder that I should say that I wish\nthese stones had been thrown into the sea?\"\n\n\"I suppose Lord Fawn will--will come all right again now?\" said Lady\nGlencora.\n\n\"All right!\" exclaimed Lizzie in astonishment.\n\n\"His objection to the marriage will now be over.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I do not in the least know what are his lordship's views,\"\nsaid Lizzie in scorn, \"and, to tell the truth, I do not very much\ncare.\"\n\n\"What I mean is, that he didn't like you to have the Eustace\ndiamonds--\"\n\n\"They were not Eustace diamonds. They were my diamonds.\"\n\n\"But he did not like you to have them; and as they are now gone--for\never--\"\n\n\"Oh, yes;--they are gone for ever.\"\n\n\"His objection is gone too. Why don't you write to him, and make him\ncome and see you? That's what I should do.\"\n\nLizzie, of course, repudiated vehemently any idea of forcing Lord\nFawn into a marriage which had become distasteful to him,--let the\nreason be what it might. \"His lordship is perfectly free, as far as I\nam concerned,\" said Lizzie with a little show of anger. But all this\nLady Glencora took at its worth. Lizzie Eustace had been a good deal\nknocked about, and Lady Glencora did not doubt but that she would be\nvery glad to get back her betrothed husband. The little woman had\nsuffered hardships,--so thought Lady Glencora,--and a good thing\nwould be done by bringing her into fashion, and setting the marriage\nup again. As to Lord Fawn,--the fortune was there, as good now as it\nhad been when he first sought it; and the lady was very pretty, a\nbaronet's widow too!--and in all respects good enough for Lord Fawn.\nA very pretty little baronet's widow she was, with four thousand\na year, and a house in Scotland, and a history. Lady Glencora\ndetermined that she would remake the match.\n\n\"I think, you know, friends who have been friends should be brought\ntogether. I suppose I may say a word to Lord Fawn?\"\n\nLizzie hesitated for a moment before she answered, and then\nremembered that revenge, at least, would be sweet to her. She had\nsworn that she would be revenged upon Lord Fawn. After all, might it\nnot suit her best to carry out her oath by marrying him? But whether\nso or otherwise, it would not but be well for her that he should be\nagain at her feet. \"Yes,--if you think good will come of it.\" The\nacquiescence was given with much hesitation;--but the circumstances\nrequired that it should be so, and Lady Glencora fully understood the\ncircumstances. When she took her leave, Lizzie was profuse in her\ngratitude. \"Oh, Lady Glencora, it has been so good of you to come.\nPray come again, if you can spare me another moment.\" Lady Glencora\nsaid that she would come again.\n\nDuring the visit she had asked some question concerning Lucinda and\nSir Griffin, and had been informed that that marriage was to go on. A\nhint had been thrown out as to Lucinda's parentage;--but Lizzie had\nnot understood the hint, and the question had not been pressed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LV\n\nQuints or Semitenths\n\n\nThe task which Lady Glencora had taken upon herself was not a very\neasy one. No doubt Lord Fawn was a man subservient to the leaders of\nhis party, much afraid of the hard judgment of those with whom he\nwas concerned, painfully open to impression from what he would have\ncalled public opinion, to a certain extent a coward, most anxious to\ndo right so that he might not be accused of being in the wrong,--and\nat the same time gifted with but little of that insight into things\nwhich teaches men to know what is right and what is wrong. Lady\nGlencora, having perceived all this, felt that he was a man upon\nwhom a few words from her might have an effect. But even Lady\nGlencora might hesitate to tell a gentleman that he ought to marry\na lady, when the gentleman had already declared his intention of not\nmarrying, and had attempted to justify his decision almost publicly\nby a reference to the lady's conduct. Lady Glencora almost felt that\nshe had undertaken too much as she turned over in her mind the means\nshe had of performing her promise to Lady Eustace.\n\nThe five-farthing bill had been laid upon the table on a Tuesday, and\nwas to be read the first time on the following Monday week. On the\nWednesday Lady Glencora had written to the duke, and had called in\nHertford Street. On the following Sunday she was at Matching, looking\nafter the duke;--but she returned to London on the Tuesday, and on\nthe Wednesday there was a little dinner at Mr. Palliser's house,\ngiven avowedly with the object of further friendly discussion\nrespecting the new Palliser penny. The prime minister was to be\nthere, and Mr. Bonteen, and Barrington Erle, and those special\nmembers of the Government who would be available for giving special\nhelp to the financial Hercules of the day. A question, perhaps of no\ngreat practical importance, had occurred to Mr. Palliser,--but one\nwhich, if overlooked, might be fatal to the ultimate success of the\nmeasure. There is so much in a name,--and then an ounce of ridicule\nis often more potent than a hundredweight of argument. By what\ndenomination should the fifth part of a penny be hereafter known?\nSome one had, ill-naturedly, whispered to Mr. Palliser that a\nfarthing meant a fourth, and at once there arose a new trouble, which\nfor a time bore very heavily on him. Should he boldly disregard the\noriginal meaning of the useful old word; or should he venture on the\ndangers of new nomenclature? October, as he said to himself, is still\nthe tenth month of the year, November the eleventh, and so on, though\nby these names they are so plainly called the eighth and ninth. All\nFrance tried to rid itself of this absurdity, and failed. Should he\nstick by the farthing; or should he call it a fifthing, a quint, or\na semitenth? \"There's the 'Fortnightly Review' comes out but once a\nmonth,\" he said to his friend Mr. Bonteen, \"and I'm told that it does\nvery well.\" Mr. Bonteen, who was a rational man, thought the \"Review\"\nwould do better if it were called by a more rational name, and was\nvery much in favour of \"a quint.\" Mr. Gresham had expressed an\nopinion, somewhat off-hand, that English people would never be got\nto talk about quints, and so there was a difficulty. A little dinner\nwas therefore arranged, and Mr. Palliser, as was his custom in such\nmatters, put the affair of the dinner into his wife's hands. When he\nwas told that she had included Lord Fawn among the guests he opened\nhis eyes. Lord Fawn, who might be good enough at the India Office,\nknew literally nothing about the penny. \"He'll take it as the\ngreatest compliment in the world,\" said Lady Glencora. \"I don't want\nto pay Lord Fawn a compliment,\" said Mr. Palliser. \"But I do,\" said\nLady Glencora. And so the matter was arranged.\n\nIt was a very nice little dinner. Mrs. Gresham and Mrs. Bonteen were\nthere, and the great question of the day was settled in two minutes,\nbefore the guests went out of the drawing-room. \"Stick to your\nfarthing,\" said Mr. Gresham.\n\n\"I think so,\" said Mr. Palliser.\n\n\"Quint's a very easy word,\" said Mr. Bonteen.\n\n\"But squint is an easier,\" said Mr. Gresham, with all a prime\nminister's jocose authority.\n\n\"They'd certainly be called cock-eyes,\" said Barrington Erle.\n\n\"There's nothing of the sound of a quarter in farthing,\" said Mr.\nPalliser.\n\n\"Stick to the old word,\" said Mr. Gresham. And so the matter was\ndecided while Lady Glencora was flattering Lord Fawn as to the manner\nin which he had finally arranged the affair of the Sawab of Mygawb.\nThen they went down to dinner, and not a word more was said that\nevening about the new penny by Mr. Palliser.\n\nBefore dinner Lady Glencora had exacted a promise from Lord Fawn that\nhe would return to the drawing-room. Lady Glencora was very clever\nat such work, and said nothing then of her purpose. She did not\nwant her guests to run away, and therefore Lord Fawn,--Lord Fawn\nespecially,--must stay. If he were to go there would be nothing\nspoken of all the evening, but that weary new penny. To oblige her he\nmust remain;--and, of course, he did remain. \"Whom do you think I saw\nthe other day?\" said Lady Glencora, when she got her victim into a\ncorner. Of course, Lord Fawn had no idea whom she might have seen. Up\nto that moment no suspicion of what was coming upon him had crossed\nhis mind. \"I called upon poor Lady Eustace, and found her in bed.\"\nThen did Lord Fawn blush up to the roots of his hair, and for a\nmoment he was stricken dumb. \"I do feel for her so much! I think she\nhas been so hardly used!\"\n\nHe was obliged to say something. \"My name has, of course, been much\nmixed up with hers.\"\n\n\"Yes, Lord Fawn, I know it has. And it is because I am so sure of\nyour high-minded generosity and--and thorough devotion, that I have\nventured to speak to you. I am sure there is nothing you would wish\nso much as to get at the truth.\"\n\n\"Certainly, Lady Glencora.\"\n\n\"All manner of stories have been told about her, and, as I believe,\nwithout the slightest foundation. They tell me now that she had an\nundoubted right to keep the diamonds;--that even if Sir Florian did\nnot give them to her, they were hers under his will. Those lawyers\nhave given up all idea of proceeding against her.\"\n\n\"Because the necklace has been stolen.\"\n\n\"Altogether independently of that. Do you see Mr. Eustace, and ask\nhim if what I say is not true. If it had not been her own she would\nhave been responsible for the value, even though it were stolen; and\nwith such a fortune as hers they would never have allowed her to\nescape. They were as bitter against her as they could be;--weren't\nthey?\"\n\n\"Mr. Camperdown thought that the property should be given up.\"\n\n\"Oh yes;--that's the man's name; a horrid man. I am told that he was\nreally most cruel to her. And then, because a lot of thieves had\ngot about her,--after the diamonds, you know, like flies round a\nhoney-pot,--and took first her necklace and then her money, they were\nimpudent enough to say that she had stolen her own things!\"\n\n\"I don't think they quite said that, Lady Glencora.\"\n\n\"Something very much like it, Lord Fawn. I have no doubt in my own\nmind who did steal all the things.\"\n\n\"Who was it?\"\n\n\"Oh,--one mustn't mention names in such an affair without evidence.\nAt any rate, she has been very badly treated, and I shall take her\nup. If I were you I would go and call upon her;--I would indeed.\nI think you owe it to her. Well, duke, what do you think of\nPlantagenet's penny now? Will it ever be worth two halfpence?\" This\nquestion was asked of the Duke of St. Bungay, a great nobleman whom\nall Liberals loved, and a member of the Cabinet. He had come in since\ndinner, and had been asking a question or two as to what had been\ndecided.\n\n\"Well, yes; if properly invested I think it will. I'm glad that it is\nnot to contain five semitenths. A semitenth would never have been a\npopular form of money in England. We hate new names so much that we\nhave not yet got beyond talking of fourpenny bits.\"\n\n\"There's a great deal in a name;--isn't there? You don't think\nthey'll call them Pallisers, or Palls, or anything of that sort;--do\nyou? I shouldn't like to hear that under the new r\u00c3\u00a9gime two lollypops\nwere to cost three Palls. But they say it never can be carried this\nsession,--and we sha'n't be in, in the next year.\"\n\n\"Who says so? Don't be such a prophetess of evil, Lady Glencora.\nI mean to be in for the next three sessions, and I mean to see\nPalliser's measure carried through the House of Lords next session. I\nshall be paying for my mutton-chops at the club at so many quints a\nchop yet. Don't you think so, Fawn?\"\n\n\"I don't know what to think,\" said Lord Fawn, whose mind was intent\non other matters. After that he left the room as quickly as he could,\nand escaped out into the street. His mind was very much disturbed. If\nLady Glencora was determined to take up the cudgels for the woman he\nhad rejected, the comfort and peace of his life would be over. He\nknew well enough how strong was Lady Glencora.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVI\n\nJob's Comforters\n\n\nMrs. Carbuncle and Lady Eustace had now been up in town between six\nand seven weeks, and the record of their doings has necessarily dealt\nchiefly with robberies and the rumours of robberies. But at intervals\nthe minds of the two ladies had been intent on other things. The\nformer was still intent on marrying her niece, Lucinda Roanoke, to\nSir Griffin, and the latter had never for a moment forgotten the\nimperative duty which lay upon her of revenging herself upon Lord\nFawn. The match between Sir Griffin and Lucinda was still to be a\nmatch. Mrs. Carbuncle persevered in the teeth both of the gentleman\nand of the lady, and still promised herself success. And our Lizzie,\nin the midst of all her troubles, had not been idle. In doing her\njustice we must acknowledge that she had almost abandoned the hope\nof becoming Lady Fawn. Other hopes and other ambitions had come\nupon her. Latterly the Corsair had been all in all to her,--with\nexceptional moments in which she told herself that her heart belonged\nexclusively to her cousin Frank. But Lord Fawn's offences were not to\nbe forgotten, and she continually urged upon her cousin the depth of\nthe wrongs which she had suffered.\n\nOn the part of Frank Greystock there was certainly no desire to let\nthe Under-Secretary escape. It is hoped that the reader, to whom\nevery tittle of this story has been told without reserve, and every\nsecret unfolded, will remember that others were not treated with so\nmuch open candour. The reader knows much more of Lizzie Eustace than\ndid her cousin Frank. He, indeed, was not quite in love with Lizzie;\nbut to him she was a pretty, graceful young woman, to whom he was\nbound by many ties, and who had been cruelly injured. Dangerous she\nwas doubtless, and perhaps a little artificial. To have had her\nmarried to Lord Fawn would have been a good thing,--and would still\nbe a good thing. According to all the rules known in such matters\nLord Fawn was bound to marry her. He had become engaged to her,\nand Lizzie had done nothing to forfeit her engagement. As to the\nnecklace,--the plea made for jilting her on that ground was a\ndisgraceful pretext. Everybody was beginning to perceive that Mr.\nCamperdown would never have succeeded in getting the diamonds from\nher, even if they had not been stolen. It was \"preposterous,\" as\nFrank said over and over again to his friend Herriot, that a man\nwhen he was engaged to a lady, should take upon himself to judge her\nconduct as Lord Fawn had done,--and then ride out of his engagement\non a verdict found by himself. Frank had therefore willingly\ndisplayed alacrity in persecuting his lordship, and had not been\naltogether without hope that he might drive the two into a marriage\nyet,--in spite of the protestations made by Lizzie at Portray.\n\nLord Fawn had certainly not spent a happy winter. Between Mrs.\nHittaway on one side and Frank Greystock on the other, his life had\nbeen a burthen to him. It had been suggested to him by various people\nthat he was behaving badly to the lady,--who was represented as\nhaving been cruelly misused by fortune and by himself. On the other\nhand it had been hinted to him, that nothing was too bad to believe\nof Lizzie Eustace, and that no calamity could be so great as that by\nwhich he would be overwhelmed were he still to allow himself to be\nforced into that marriage. \"It would be better,\" Mrs. Hittaway had\nsaid, \"to retire to Ireland at once, and cultivate your demesne in\nTipperary.\" This was a grievous sentence, and one which had greatly\nexcited the brother's wrath;--but it had shown how very strong was\nhis sister's opinion against the lady to whom he had unfortunately\noffered his hand. Then there came to him a letter from Mr. Greystock,\nin which he was asked for his \"written explanation.\" If there be a\nproceeding which an official man dislikes worse than another, it is a\ndemand for a written explanation. \"It is impossible,\" Frank had said,\n\"that your conduct to my cousin should be allowed to drop without\nfurther notice. Hers has been without reproach. Your engagement with\nher has been made public,--chiefly by you, and it is out of the\nquestion that she should be treated as you are treating her, and that\nyour lordship should escape without punishment.\" What the punishment\nwas to be he did not say; but there did come a punishment on Lord\nFawn from the eyes of every man whose eyes met his own, and in the\ntones of every voice that addressed him. The looks of the very clerks\nin the India Office accused him of behaving badly to a young woman,\nand the doorkeeper at the House of Lords seemed to glance askance\nat him. And now Lady Glencora, who was the social leader of his\nown party, the feminine pole-star of the Liberal heavens, the most\npopular and the most daring woman in London, had attacked him\npersonally, and told him that he ought to call on Lady Eustace!\n\nLet it not for a moment be supposed that Lord Fawn was without\nconscience in the matter, or indifferent to moral obligations. There\nwas not a man in London less willing to behave badly to a young woman\nthan Lord Fawn; or one who would more diligently struggle to get back\nto the right path, if convinced that he was astray. But he was one\nwho detested interference in his private matters, and who was nearly\ndriven mad between his sister and Frank Greystock. When he left Lady\nGlencora's house he walked towards his own abode with a dark cloud\nupon his brow. He was at first very angry with Lady Glencora. Even\nher position gave her no right to meddle with his most private\naffairs as she had done. He would resent it, and would quarrel with\nLady Glencora. What right could she have to advise him to call upon\nany woman? But by degrees this wrath died away, and gave place to\nfears, and qualms, and inward questions. He, too, had found a change\nin general opinion about the diamonds. When he had taken upon himself\nwith a high hand to dissolve his own engagement, everybody had, as he\nthought, acknowledged that Lizzie Eustace was keeping property which\ndid not belong to her. Now people talked of her losses as though the\ndiamonds had been undoubtedly her own. On the next morning Lord Fawn\ntook an opportunity of seeing Mr. Camperdown.\n\n\"My dear lord,\" said Mr. Camperdown, \"I shall wash my hands of the\nmatter altogether. The diamonds are gone, and the questions now are,\nwho stole them, and where are they? In our business we can't meddle\nwith such questions as those.\"\n\n\"You will drop the bill in Chancery then?\"\n\n\"What good can the bill do us when the diamonds are gone? If Lady\nEustace had anything to do with the robbery--\"\n\n\"You suspect her, then?\"\n\n\"No, my lord; no. I cannot say that. I have no right to say that.\nIndeed it is not Lady Eustace that I suspect. She has got into bad\nhands, perhaps; but I do not think that she is a thief.\"\n\n\"You were suggesting that,--if she had anything to do with the\nrobbery--\"\n\n\"Well;--yes;--if she had, it would not be for us to take steps\nagainst her in the matter. In fact, the trustees have decided that\nthey will do nothing more, and my hands are tied. If the minor, when\nhe comes of age, claims the property from them, they will prefer to\nreplace it. It isn't very likely; but that's what they say.\"\n\n\"But if it was an heirloom--\" suggested Lord Fawn, going back to the\nold claim.\n\n\"That's exploded,\" said Mr. Camperdown. \"Mr. Dove was quite clear\nabout that.\"\n\nThis was the end of the filing of that bill in Chancery as to which\nMr. Camperdown had been so very enthusiastic! Now it certainly was\nthe case that poor Lord Fawn in his conduct towards Lizzie had\ntrusted greatly to the support of Mr. Camperdown's legal proceeding.\nThe world could hardly have expected him to marry a woman against\nwhom a bill in Chancery was being carried on for the recovery of\ndiamonds which did not belong to her. But that support was now\naltogether withdrawn from him. It was acknowledged that the necklace\nwas not an heirloom,--clearly acknowledged by Mr. Camperdown! And\neven Mr. Camperdown would not express an opinion that the lady had\nstolen her own diamonds.\n\nHow would it go with him, if after all, he were to marry her? The\nbone of contention between them had at any rate been made to vanish.\nThe income was still there, and Lady Glencora Palliser had all but\npromised her friendship. As he entered the India Office on his return\nfrom Mr. Camperdown's chambers, he almost thought that that would\nbe the best way out of his difficulty. In his room he found his\nbrother-in-law, Mr. Hittaway, waiting for him. It is always necessary\nthat a man should have some friend whom he can trust in delicate\naffairs, and Mr. Hittaway was selected as Lord Fawn's friend. He was\nnot at all points the man whom Lord Fawn would have chosen, but for\ntheir close connexion. Mr. Hittaway was talkative, perhaps a little\nloud, and too apt to make capital out of every incident of his life.\nBut confidential friends are not easily found, and one does not wish\nto increase the circle to whom one's family secrets must become\nknown. Mr. Hittaway was at any rate zealous for the Fawn family, and\nthen his character as an official man stood high. He had been asked\non the previous evening to step across from the Civil Appeal Office\nto give his opinion respecting that letter from Frank Greystock\ndemanding a written explanation. The letter had been sent to him; and\nMr. Hittaway had carried it home and shown it to his wife. \"He's a\ncantankerous Tory, and determined to make himself disagreeable,\" said\nMr. Hittaway, taking the letter from his pocket and beginning the\nconversation. Lord Fawn seated himself in his great arm-chair,\nand buried his face in his hands. \"I am disposed, after much\nconsideration, to advise you to take no notice of the letter,\" said\nMr. Hittaway, giving his counsel in accordance with instructions\nreceived from his wife. Lord Fawn still buried his face. \"Of course\nthe thing is painful,--very painful. But out of two evils one should\nchoose the least. The writer of this letter is altogether unable to\ncarry out his threat.\" \"What can the man do to him?\" Mrs. Hittaway\nhad asked, almost snapping at her husband as she did so. \"And then,\"\ncontinued Mr. Hittaway, \"we all know that public opinion is with you\naltogether. The conduct of Lady Eustace is notorious.\"\n\n\"Everybody is taking her part,\" said Lord Fawn, almost crying.\n\n\"Surely not.\"\n\n\"Yes;--they are. The bill in Chancery has been withdrawn, and it's\nmy belief that if the necklace were found to-morrow, there would be\nnothing to prevent her keeping it,--just as she did before.\"\n\n\"But it was an heirloom?\"\n\n\"No, it wasn't. The lawyers were all wrong about it. As far as I can\nsee, lawyers always are wrong. About those nine lacs of rupees for\nthe Sawab, Finlay was all wrong. Camperdown owns that he was wrong.\nIf, after all, the diamonds were hers, I'm sure I don't know what I\nam to do. Thank you, Hittaway, for coming over. That'll do for the\npresent. Just leave that ruffian's letter, and I'll think about it.\"\n\nThis was considered by Mrs. Hittaway to be a very bad state of\nthings, and there was great consternation in Warwick Square when Mr.\nHittaway told his wife this new story of her brother's weakness.\nShe was not going to be weak. She did not intend to withdraw her\nopposition to the marriage. She was not going to be frightened by\nLizzie Eustace and Frank Greystock,--knowing as she did that they\nwere lovers, and very improper lovers, too. \"Of course she stole them\nherself,\" said Mrs. Hittaway; \"and I don't doubt but she stole her\nown money afterwards. There's nothing she wouldn't do. I'd sooner see\nFrederic in his grave than married to such a woman as that. Men don't\nknow how sly women can be;--that's the truth. And Frederic has been\nso spoilt among them down at Richmond, that he has no real judgment\nleft. I don't suppose he means to marry her.\"\n\n\"Upon my word I don't know,\" said Mr. Hittaway. Then Mrs. Hittaway\nmade up her mind that she would at once write a letter to Scotland.\n\nThere was an old lord about London in those days,--or, rather, one\nwho was an old Liberal but a young lord,--one Lord Mount Thistle,\nwho had sat in the Cabinet, and had lately been made a peer when\nhis place in the Cabinet was wanted. He was a pompous, would-be\nimportant, silly old man, well acquainted with all the traditions of\nhis party, and perhaps, on that account, useful,--but a bore, and\nvery apt to meddle when he was not wanted. Lady Glencora, on the\nday after her dinner-party, whispered into his ear that Lord Fawn\nwas getting himself into trouble, and that a few words of caution,\ncoming to him from one whom he respected so much as he did Lord Mount\nThistle, would be of service to him. Lord Mount Thistle had known\nLord Fawn's father, and declared himself at once to be quite entitled\nto interfere. \"He is really behaving badly to Lady Eustace,\" said\nLady Glencora, \"and I don't think that he knows it.\" Lord Mount\nThistle, proud of a commission from the hands of Lady Glencora, went\nalmost at once to his old friend's son. He found him at the House\nthat night, and whispered his few words of caution in one of the\nlobbies.\n\n\"I know you will excuse me, Fawn,\" Lord Mount Thistle said, \"but\npeople seem to think that you are not behaving quite well to Lady\nEustace.\"\n\n\"What people?\" demanded Lord Fawn.\n\n\"My dear fellow, that is a question that cannot be answered. You know\nthat I am the last man to interfere if I didn't think it my duty as a\nfriend. You were engaged to her?\"--Lord Fawn only frowned. \"If so,\"\ncontinued the late cabinet minister, \"and if you have broken it off,\nyou ought to give your reasons. She has a right to demand as much as\nthat.\"\n\nOn the next morning, Friday, there came to him the note which Lady\nGlencora had recommended Lizzie to write. It was very short. \"Had you\nnot better come and see me? You can hardly think that things should\nbe left as they are now. L. E.--Hertford Street, Thursday.\" He had\nhoped,--he had ventured to hope,--that things might be left, and\nthat they would arrange themselves; that he could throw aside his\nengagement without further trouble, and that the subject would drop.\nBut it was not so. His enemy, Frank Greystock, had demanded from him\na \"written explanation\" of his conduct. Mr. Camperdown had deserted\nhim. Lady Glencora Palliser, with whom he had not the honour of any\nintimate acquaintance, had taken upon herself to give him advice.\nLord Mount Thistle had found fault with him. And now there had come\na note from Lizzie Eustace herself, which he could hardly venture to\nleave altogether unnoticed. On that Friday he dined at his club, and\nthen went to his sister's house in Warwick Square. If assistance\nmight be had anywhere, it would be from his sister;--she, at any\nrate, would not want courage in carrying on the battle on his behalf.\n\n\"Ill-used!\" she said, as soon as they were closeted together. \"Who\ndares to say so?\"\n\n\"That old fool, Mount Thistle, has been with me.\"\n\n\"I hope, Frederic, you don't mind what such a man as that says. He\nhas probably been prompted by some friend of hers. And who else?\"\n\n\"Camperdown turns round now and says that they don't mean to do\nanything more about the necklace. Lady Glencora Palliser told me the\nother day that all the world believes that the thing was her own.\"\n\n\"What does Lady Glencora Palliser know about it? If Lady Glencora\nPalliser would mind her own affairs it would be much better for her.\nI remember when she had troubles enough of her own, without meddling\nwith other people's.\"\n\n\"And now I've got this note.\" Lord Fawn had already shown Lizzie's\nfew scrawled words to his sister. \"I think I must go and see her.\"\n\n\"Do no such thing, Frederic.\"\n\n\"Why not? I must answer it, and what can I say?\"\n\n\"If you go there, that woman will be your wife, and you'll never have\na happy day again as long as you live. The match is broken off, and\nshe knows it. I shouldn't take the slightest notice of her, or of her\ncousin, or of any of them. If she chooses to bring an action against\nyou, that is another thing.\"\n\nLord Fawn paused for a few moments before he answered. \"I think I\nought to go,\" he said.\n\n\"And I am sure that you ought not. It is not only about the\ndiamonds,--though that was quite enough to break off any engagement.\nHave you forgotten what I told you that the man saw at Portray?\"\n\n\"I don't know that the man spoke the truth.\"\n\n\"But he did.\"\n\n\"And I hate that kind of espionage. It is so very likely that\nmistakes should be made.\"\n\n\"When she was sitting in his arms,--and kissing him! If you choose\nto do it, Frederic, of course you must. We can't prevent it. You are\nfree to marry any one you please.\"\n\n\"I'm not talking of marrying her.\"\n\n\"What do you suppose she wants you to go there for? As for political\nlife, I am quite sure it would be the death of you. If I were you I\nwouldn't go near her. You have got out of the scrape, and I would\nremain out.\"\n\n\"But I haven't got out,\" said Lord Fawn.\n\nOn the next day, Saturday, he did nothing in the matter. He went\ndown, as was his custom, to Richmond, and did not once mention\nLizzie's name. Lady Fawn and her daughters never spoke of her\nnow,--neither of her, nor, in his presence, of poor Lucy Morris. But\non his return to London on the Sunday evening he found another note\nfrom Lizzie. \"You will hardly have the hardihood to leave my note\nunanswered. Pray let me know when you will come to me.\" Some answer\nmust, as he felt, be made to her. For a moment he thought of asking\nhis mother to call;--but he at once saw that by doing so he might lay\nhimself open to terrible ridicule. Could he induce Lord Mount Thistle\nto be his Mercury? It would, he felt, be quite impossible to make\nLord Mount Thistle understand all the facts of his position. His\nsister, Mrs. Hittaway, might have gone, were it not that she herself\nwas violently opposed to any visit. The more he thought of it the\nmore convinced he became that, should it be known that he had\nreceived two such notes from a lady and that he had not answered or\nnoticed them, the world would judge him to have behaved badly. So, at\nlast, he wrote,--on that Sunday evening,--fixing a somewhat distant\nday for his visit to Hertford Street. His note was as follows:--\n\n\n   Lord Fawn presents his compliments to Lady Eustace. In\n   accordance with the wish expressed in Lady Eustace's two\n   notes of the 23rd instant and this date, Lord Fawn will\n   do himself the honour of waiting upon Lady Eustace on\n   Saturday next, March 3rd, at 12, noon. Lord Fawn had\n   thought that under circumstances as they now exist, no\n   further personal interview could lead to the happiness of\n   either party; but as Lady Eustace thinks otherwise, he\n   feels himself constrained to comply with her desire.\n\n   Sunday evening, 25 February, 18--.\n\n\n\"I am going to see her in the course of this week,\" he said, in\nanswer to a further question from Lady Glencora, who, chancing to\nmeet him in society, had again addressed him on the subject. He\nlacked the courage to tell Lady Glencora to mind her own business and\nto allow him to do the same. Had she been a little less great than\nshe was,--either as regarded herself or her husband,--he would have\ndone so. But Lady Glencora was the social queen of the party to which\nhe belonged, and Mr. Palliser was Chancellor of the Exchequer, and\nwould some day be Duke of Omnium.\n\n\"As you are great, be merciful, Lord Fawn,\" said Lady Glencora. \"You\nmen, I believe, never realise what it is that women feel when they\nlove. It is my belief that she will die unless you are re-united to\nher. And then she is so beautiful!\"\n\n\"It is a subject that I cannot discuss, Lady Glencora.\"\n\n\"I daresay not. And I'm sure I am the last person to wish to give you\npain. But you see,--if the poor lady has done nothing to merit your\nanger, it does seem rather a strong measure to throw her off and\ngive her no reason whatever. How would you defend yourself, suppose\nshe published it all?\" Lady Glencora's courage was very great,--and\nperhaps we may say her impudence also. This last question Lord Fawn\nleft unanswered, walking away in great dudgeon.\n\nIn the course of the week he told his sister of the interview which\nhe had promised, and she endeavoured to induce him to postpone it\ntill a certain man should arrive from Scotland. She had written for\nMr. Andrew Gowran,--sending down funds for Mr. Gowran's journey,--so\nthat her brother might hear Mr. Gowran's evidence out of Mr.\nGowran's own mouth. Would not Frederic postpone the interview\ntill he should have seen Mr. Gowran? But to this request Frederic\ndeclined to accede. He had fixed a day and an hour. He had made an\nappointment;--of course he must keep it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVII\n\nHumpty Dumpty\n\n\nThe robbery at the house in Hertford Street took place on the 30th of\nJanuary, and on the morning of the 28th of February Bunfit and Gager\nwere sitting together in a melancholy, dark little room in Scotland\nYard, discussing the circumstances of that nefarious act. A month had\ngone by, and nobody was yet in custody. A month had passed since that\nsecond robbery; but nearly eight weeks had passed since the robbery\nat Carlisle, and even that was still a mystery. The newspapers had\nbeen loud in their condemnation of the police. It had been asserted\nover and over again that in no other civilised country in the world\ncould so great an amount of property have passed through the hands\nof thieves without leaving some clue by which the police would have\nmade their way to the truth. Major Mackintosh had been declared to be\naltogether incompetent, and all the Bunfits and Gagers of the force\nhad been spoken of as drones and moles and ostriches. They were idle\nand blind, and so stupid as to think that, when they saw nothing,\nothers saw less. The major, who was a broad-shouldered, philosophical\nman, bore all this as though it were, of necessity, a part of the\nburthen of his profession;--but the Bunfits and Gagers were very\nangry, and at their wits' ends. It did not occur to them to feel\nanimosity against the newspapers which abused them. The thieves who\nwould not be caught were their great enemies; and there was common\nto them a conviction that men so obstinate as these thieves,--men\nto whom a large amount of grace and liberty for indulgence had\naccrued,--should be treated with uncommon severity when they were\ncaught. There was this excuse always on their lips,--that had it\nbeen an affair simply of thieves, such as thieves ordinarily are,\neverything would have been discovered long since;--but when lords and\nladies with titles come to be mixed up with such an affair,--folk\nin whose house a policeman can't have his will at searching and\nbrow-beating,--how is a detective to detect anything?\n\nBunfit and Gager had both been driven to recast their theories as to\nthe great Carlisle affair by the circumstances of the later affair\nin Hertford Street. They both thought that Lord George had been\nconcerned in the robbery;--that, indeed, had now become the general\nopinion of the world at large. He was a man of doubtful character,\nwith large expenses, and with no recognised means of living. He had\nformed a great intimacy with Lady Eustace at a period in which she\nwas known to be carrying these diamonds about with her, had been\nstaying with her at Portray Castle when the diamonds were there, and\nhad been her companion on the journey during which the diamonds were\nstolen. The only men in London supposed to be capable of dealing\nadvantageously with such a property were Harter and Benjamin,--as to\nwhom it was known that they were conversant with the existence of\nthe diamonds, and known, also, that they were in the habit of having\ndealings with Lord George. It was, moreover, known that Lord George\nhad been closeted with Mr. Benjamin on the morning after his arrival\nin London. These things put together made it almost a certainty that\nLord George had been concerned in the matter. Bunfit had always been\nsure of it. Gager, though differing much from Bunfit as to details,\nhad never been unwilling to suspect Lord George. But the facts known\ncould not be got to dovetail themselves pleasantly. If Lord George\nhad possessed himself of the diamonds at Carlisle,--or with Lizzie's\nconnivance before they reached Carlisle,--then, why had there been\na second robbery? Bunfit, who was very profound in his theory,\nsuggested that the second robbery was an additional plant, got up\nwith the view of throwing more dust into the eyes of the police.\nPatience Crabstick had, of course, been one of the gang throughout,\nand she had now been allowed to go off with her mistress's money and\nlesser trinkets,--so that the world of Scotland Yard might be thrown\nmore and more into the mire of ignorance and darkness of doubt. To\nthis view Gager was altogether opposed. He was inclined to think\nthat Lord George had taken the diamonds at Carlisle with Lizzie's\nconnivance;--that he had restored them in London to her keeping,\nfinding the suspicion against him too heavy to admit of his dealing\nwith them,--and that now he had stolen them a second time, again with\nLizzie's connivance; but in this latter point Gager did not pretend\nto the assurance of any conviction.\n\nBut Gager at the present moment had achieved a triumph in the matter\nwhich he was not at all disposed to share with his elder officer.\nPerhaps, on the whole, more power is lost than gained by habits of\nsecrecy. To be discreet is a fine thing,--especially for a policeman;\nbut when discretion is carried to such a length in the direction\nof self-confidence as to produce a belief that no aid is wanted\nfor the achievement of great results, it will often militate\nagainst all achievement. Had Scotland Yard been less discreet\nand more confidential, the mystery might, perhaps, have been\nsooner unravelled. Gager at this very moment had reason to\nbelieve that a man whom he knew could,--and would, if operated\nupon duly,--communicate to him, Gager, the secret of the present\nwhereabouts of Patience Crabstick! That belief was a great\npossession, and much too important, as Gager thought, to be shared\nlightly with such an one as Mr. Bunfit,--a thick-headed sort of man,\nin Gager's opinion, although, no doubt, he had by means of industry\nbeen successful in some difficult cases.\n\n\"'Is lordship ain't stirred,\" said Bunfit.\n\n\"How do you mean,--stirred, Mr. Bunfit?\"\n\n\"Ain't moved nowheres out of London.\"\n\n\"What should he move out of London for? What could he get by cutting?\nThere ain't nothing so bad when anything's up against one as letting\non that one wants to bolt. He knows all that. He'll stand his ground.\nHe won't bolt.\"\n\n\"I don't suppose as he will, Gager. It's a rum go; ain't it?--the\nrummest as I ever see.\" This remark had been made so often by Mr.\nBunfit, that Gager had become almost weary of hearing it.\n\n\"Oh,--rum; rum be b---- What's the use of all that? From what the\ngovernor told me this morning, there isn't a shadow of doubt where\nthe diamonds are.\"\n\n\"In Paris,--of course,\" said Bunfit.\n\n\"They never went to Paris. They were taken from here to Hamburg in a\ncommercial man's kit,--a fellow as travels in knives and scissors.\nThen they was recut. They say the cutting was the quickest bit of\nwork ever done by one man in Hamburg. And now they're in New York.\nThat's what has come of the diamonds.\"\n\n\"Benjamin, in course,\" said Bunfit, in a low whisper, just taking the\npipe from between his lips.\n\n\"Well;--yes. No doubt it was Benjamin. But how did Benjamin get 'em?\"\n\n\"Lord George,--in course,\" said Bunfit.\n\n\"And how did he get 'em?\"\n\n\"Well;--that's where it is; isn't it?\" Then there was a pause, during\nwhich Bunfit continued to smoke. \"As sure as your name's Gager, he\ngot 'em at Carlisle.\"\n\n\"And what took Smiler down to Carlisle?\"\n\n\"Just to put a face on it,\" said Bunfit.\n\n\"And who cut the door?\"\n\n\"Billy Cann did,\" said Bunfit.\n\n\"And who forced the box?\"\n\n\"Them two did,\" said Bunfit.\n\n\"And all to put a face on it?\"\n\n\"Yes;--just that. And an uncommon good face they did put on it\nbetween 'em;--the best as I ever see.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Gager. \"So far, so good. I don't agree with you,\nMr. Bunfit; because the thing, when it was done, wouldn't be worth\nthe money. Lord love you, what would all that have cost? And what was\nto prevent the lady and Lord George together taking the diamonds to\nBenjamin and getting their price? It never does to be too clever,\nMr. Bunfit. And when that was all done, why did the lady go and get\nherself robbed again? No;--I don't say but what you're a clever man,\nin your way, Mr. Bunfit; but you've not got a hold of the thing\nhere. Why was Smiler going about like a mad dog,--only that he found\nhimself took in?\"\n\n\"Maybe he expected something else in the box,--more than the\nnecklace,--as was to come to him,\" suggested Bunfit.\n\n\"Gammon.\"\n\n\"I don't see why you say gammon, Gager. It ain't polite.\"\n\n\"It is gammon,--running away with ideas like them, just as if you was\none of the public. When they two opened that box at Carlisle, which\nthey did as certain as you sit there, they believed as the diamonds\nwere there. They were not there.\"\n\n\"I don't think as they was,\" said Bunfit.\n\n\"Very well;--where were they? Just walk up to it, Mr. Bunfit, making\nyour ground good as you go. They two men cut the door, and took the\nbox, and opened it,--and when they'd opened it, they didn't get the\nswag. Where was the swag?\"\n\n\"Lord George,\" said Bunfit again.\n\n\"Very well,--Lord George. Like enough. But it comes to this.\nBenjamin, and they two men of his, had laid themselves out for the\nrobbery. Now, Mr. Bunfit, whether Lord George and Benjamin were\ntogether in that first affair, or whether they weren't, I can't see\nmy way just at present, and I don't know as you can see yours;--not\nsaying but what you're as quick as most men, Mr. Bunfit. If he\nwas,--and I rayther think that's about it,--then he and Benjamin must\nhave had a few words, and he must have got the jewels from the lady\nover night.\"\n\n\"Of course he did,--and Smiler and Billy Cann knew as they weren't\nthere.\"\n\n\"There you are, all back again, Mr. Bunfit, not making your\nground good as you go. Smiler and Cann did their job according\nto order,--and precious sore hearts they had when they'd got\nthe box open. Those fellows at Carlisle,--just like all the\nprovincials,--went to work open-mouthed, and before the party had\nleft Carlisle it was known that Lord George was suspected.\"\n\n\"You can't trust them fellows any way,\" said Mr. Bunfit.\n\n\"Well;--what happens next? Lord George, he goes to Benjamin, but he\nisn't goin' to take the diamonds with him. He has had words with\nBenjamin or he has not. Any ways he isn't goin' to take the necklace\nwith him on that morning. He hasn't been goin' to keep the diamonds\nabout him, not since what was up at Carlisle. So he gives the\ndiamonds back to the lady.\"\n\n\"And she had 'em all along?\"\n\n\"I don't say it was so,--but I can see my way upon that hypothesis.\"\n\n\"There was something as she had to conceal, Gager. I've said that all\nthrough. I knew it in a moment when I see'd her faint.\"\n\n\"She's had a deal to conceal, I don't doubt. Well, there they\nare,--with her still,--and the box is gone, and the people as is\nbringing the lawsuit, Mr. Camperdown and the rest of 'em, is off\ntheir tack. What's she to do with 'em?\"\n\n\"Take 'em to Benjamin,\" said Bunfit, with confidence.\n\n\"That's all very well, Mr. Bunfit. But there's a quarrel up already\nwith Benjamin. Benjamin was to have had 'em before. Benjamin has\nspent a goodish bit of money, and has been thrown over rather. I\ndaresay Benjamin was as bad as Smiler, or worse. No doubt Benjamin\nlet on to Smiler, and thought as Smiler was too many for him. I\ndaresay there was a few words between him and Smiler. I wouldn't\nwonder if Smiler didn't threaten to punch Benjamin's head,--which\nwell he could do it,--and if there wasn't a few playful remarks\nbetween 'em about penal servitude for life. You see, Mr. Bunfit, it\ncouldn't have been pleasant for any of 'em.\"\n\n\"They'd've split,\" said Bunfit.\n\n\"But they didn't,--not downright. Well,--there we are. The diamonds\nis with the lady. Lord George has done it all. Lord George and Lady\nEustace,--they're keeping company, no doubt, after their own fashion.\nHe's a-robbing of her, and she has to do pretty much as she's bid.\nThe diamonds is with the lady, and Lord George is pretty well afraid\nto look at 'em. After all that's being done, there isn't much to\nwonder at in that. Then comes the second robbery.\"\n\n\"And Lord George planned that too?\" asked Bunfit.\n\n\"I don't pretend to say I know, but just put it this way, Mr. Bunfit.\nOf course the thieves were let in by the woman Crabstick.\"\n\n\"Not a doubt.\"\n\n\"Of course they was Smiler and Billy Cann.\"\n\n\"I suppose they was.\"\n\n\"She was always about the lady,--a-doing for her in everything. Say\nshe goes to Benjamin and tells him as how her lady still has the\nnecklace,--and then he puts up the second robbery. Then you'd have it\nall round.\"\n\n\"And Lord George would have lost 'em. It can't be. Lord George and he\nare thick as thieves up to this day.\"\n\n\"Very well. I don't say anything against that. Lord George knows as\nshe has 'em;--indeed he'd given 'em back to her to keep. We've got as\nfar as that, Mr. Bunfit.\"\n\n\"I think she did 'ave 'em.\"\n\n\"Very well. What does Lord George do then? He can't make money of\n'em. They're too hot for his fingers, and so he finds when he thinks\nof taking 'em into the market. So he puts Benjamin up to the second\nrobbery.\"\n\n\"Who's drawing it fine, now, Gager;--eh?\"\n\n\"Mr. Bunfit, I'm not saying as I've got the truth beyond this,--that\nBenjamin and his two men were clean done at Carlisle, that Lord\nGeorge and his lady brought the jewels up to town between 'em, and\nthat the party who didn't get 'em at Carlisle tried their hand again\nand did get 'em in Hertford Street.\" In all of which the ingenious\nGager would have been right, if he could have kept his mind clear\nfrom the alluring conviction that a lord had been the chief of the\nthieves.\n\n\"We shall never make a case of it now,\" said Bunfit despondently.\n\n\"I mean to try it on all the same. There's Smiler about town as bold\nas brass, and dressed to the nines. He had the cheek to tell me he\nwas going down to the Newmarket Spring to look after a horse he's got\na share in.\"\n\n\"I was talking to Billy only yesterday,\" added Bunfit. \"I've got\nit on my mind that they didn't treat Billy quite on the square. He\ndidn't let on anything about Benjamin; but he told me out plain, as\nhow he was very much disgusted. 'Mr. Bunfit,' said he, 'there's that\nroguery about, that a plain man like me can't touch it. There's them\nas'd pick my eyes out while I was sleeping, and then swear it against\nmy very self.' Them were his words, and I knew as how Benjamin hadn't\nbeen on the square with him.\"\n\n\"You didn't let on anything, Mr. Bunfit?\"\n\n\"Well,--I just reminded him as how there was five hundred pounds\ngoing a-begging from Mr. Camperdown.\"\n\n\"And what did he say to that, Mr. Bunfit?\"\n\n\"Well, he said a good deal. He's a sharp little fellow, is Billy, as\nhas read a deal. You've heard of 'Umpty Dumpty, Gager? 'Umpty Dumpty\nwas a hegg.\"\n\n\"All right.\"\n\n\"As had a fall, and was smashed,--and there's a little poem about\nhim.\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n\"Well;--Billy says to me: 'Mr. Camperdown don't want no hinformation;\nhe wants the diamonds. Them diamonds is like 'Umpty Dumpty, Mr.\nBunfit. All the king's horses and all the king's men couldn't put\n'Umpty Dumpty up again.'\"\n\n\"Billy was about right there,\" said the younger officer, rising from\nhis seat.\n\nLate on the afternoon of the same day, when London had already been\ngiven over to the gaslights, Mr. Gager, having dressed himself\nespecially for the occasion of the friendly visit which he intended\nto make, sauntered into a small public-house at the corner of Meek\nStreet and Pineapple Court, which locality,--as all men well versed\nwith London are aware,--lies within one minute's walk of the top of\nGray's Inn Lane. Gager, during his conference with his colleague\nBunfit, had been dressed in plain black clothes; but in spite of his\nplain clothes he looked every inch a policeman. There was a stiffness\nabout his limbs, and, at the same time, a sharpness in his eyes,\nwhich, in the conjunction with the locality in which he was placed,\ndeclared his profession beyond the possibility of mistake. Nor, in\nthat locality, would he have desired to be taken for anything else.\nBut as he entered the \"Rising Sun\" in Meek Street, there was nothing\nof the policeman about him. He might probably have been taken for a\nbetting man, with whom the world had latterly gone well enough to\nenable him to maintain that sleek, easy, greasy appearance which\nseems to be the beau-ideal of a betting man's personal ambition.\n\"Well, Mr. Howard,\" said the lady at the bar, \"a sight of you is good\nfor sore eyes.\"\n\n\"Six penn'orth of brandy,--warm, if you please, my dear,\" said the\npseudo-Howard, as he strolled easily into an inner room, with which\nhe seemed to be quite familiar. He seated himself in an old-fashioned\nwooden arm-chair, gazed up at the gas lamp, and stirred his liquor\nslowly. Occasionally he raised the glass to his lips, but he did not\nseem to be at all intent upon his drinking. When he entered the room,\nthere had been a gentleman and a lady there, whose festive moments\nseemed to be disturbed by some slight disagreement; but Howard, as he\ngazed at the lamp, paid no attention to them whatever. They soon left\nthe room, their quarrel and their drink finished together, and others\ndropped in and out. Mr. Howard's \"warm\" must almost have become\ncold, so long did he sit there, gazing at the gas lamps rather than\nattending to his brandy and water. Not a word did he speak to any one\nfor more than an hour, and not a sign did he show of impatience. At\nlast he was alone;--but had not been so for above a minute when in\nstepped a jaunty little man, certainly not more than five feet high,\nabout three or four and twenty years of age, dressed with great care,\nwith his trousers sticking to his legs, with a French chimney-pot hat\non his head, very much peaked fore and aft and closely turned up at\nthe sides. He had a bright-coloured silk handkerchief round his neck,\nand a white shirt, of which the collar and wristbands were rather\nlarger and longer than suited the small dimensions of the man.\nHe wore a white greatcoat tight buttoned round his waist, but so\narranged as to show the glories of the coloured handkerchief; and\nin his hand he carried a diminutive cane with a little silver knob.\nHe stepped airily into the room, and as he did so he addressed our\nfriend the policeman with much cordiality. \"My dear Mr. 'Oward,\" he\nsaid, \"this is a pleasure. This is a pleasure. This is a pleasure.\"\n\n\"What is it to be?\" asked Gager.\n\n\"Well;--ay, what? Shall I say a little port wine negus, with the\nnutmeg in it rayther strong?\" This suggestion he made to a young\nlady from the bar, who had followed him into the room. The negus was\nbrought and paid for by Gager, who then requested that they might be\nleft there undisturbed for five minutes. The young lady promised to\ndo her best, and then closed the door. \"And now, Mr. 'Oward, what can\nI do for you?\" said Mr. Cann, the burglar.\n\nGager, before he answered, took a pipe-case out of his pocket, and\nlit the pipe. \"Will you smoke, Billy?\" said he.\n\n\"Well;--no, I don't know that I will smoke. A very little tobacco\ngoes a long way with me, Mr. 'Oward. One cigar before I turn\nin;--that's about the outside of it. You see, Mr. 'Oward, pleasures\nshould never be made necessities, when the circumstances of a\ngentleman's life may perhaps require that they shall be abandoned for\nprolonged periods. In your line of life, Mr. 'Oward,--which has its\nobjections,--smoking may be pretty well a certainty.\" Mr. Cann, as\nhe made these remarks, skipped about the room, and gave point to his\nargument by touching Mr. Howard's waistcoat with the end of his cane.\n\n\"And now, Billy, how about the young woman?\"\n\n\"I haven't set eyes on her these six weeks, Mr. 'Oward. I never see\nher but once in my life, Mr. 'Oward;--or, maybe, twice, for one's\nmemory is deceitful; and I don't know that I ever wish to see her\nagain. She ain't one of my sort, Mr. 'Oward. I likes 'em soft, and\nsweet, and coming. This one,--she has her good p'ints about her,--as\nclean a foot and ankle as I'd wish to see;--but, laws, what a nose,\nMr. 'Oward! And then for manner;--she's no more manner than a stable\ndog.\"\n\n\"She's in London, Billy?\"\n\n\"How am I to know, Mr. 'Oward?\"\n\n\"What's the good, then, of your coming here?\" asked Gager, with no\nlittle severity in his voice.\n\n\"I don't know as it is good. I 'aven't said nothing about any good,\nMr. 'Oward. What you wants to find is them diamonds?\"\n\n\"Of course I do.\"\n\n\"Well;--you won't find 'em. I knows nothing about 'em, in course,\nexcept just what I'm told. You know my line of life, Mr. 'Oward?\"\n\n\"Not a doubt about it.\"\n\n\"And I know yours. I'm in the way of hearing about these things,--and\nfor the matter of that, so are you too. It may be, my ears are the\nlonger. I 'ave 'eard. You don't expect me to tell you more than just\nthat. I 'ave 'eard. It was a pretty thing, wasn't it? But I wasn't in\nit myself, more's the pity. You can't expect fairer than that, Mr.\n'Oward?\"\n\n\"And what have you heard?\"\n\n\"Them diamonds is gone where none of you can get at 'em. That five\nhundred pounds as the lawyers 'ave offered is just nowhere. If you\nwant information, Mr. 'Oward, you should say information.\"\n\n\"And you could give it;--eh, Billy?\"\n\n\"No--; no--\" He uttered these two negatives in a low voice, and with\nmuch deliberation. \"I couldn't give it. A man can't give what he\nhasn't got;--but perhaps I could get it.\"\n\n\"What an ass you are, Billy. Don't you know that I know all about\nit?\"\n\n\"What an ass you are, Mr. 'Oward. Don't I know that you don't\nknow;--or you wouldn't come to me. You guess. You're always\na-guessing. And because you know how to guess, they pays you for\nguessing. But guessing ain't knowing. You don't know;--nor yet don't\nI. What is it to be, if I find out where that young woman is?\"\n\n\"A tenner, Billy.\"\n\n\"Five quid now, and five when you've seen her.\"\n\n\"All right, Billy.\"\n\n\"She's a-going to be married to Smiler next Sunday as ever is down at\nRamsgate;--and at Ramsgate she is now. You'll find her, Mr. 'Oward,\nif you'll keep your eyes open, somewhere about the 'Fiddle with One\nString.'\"\n\nThis information was so far recognised by Mr. Howard as correct, that\nhe paid Mr. Cann five sovereigns down for it at once.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVIII\n\n\"The Fiddle with One String\"\n\n\nMr. Gager reached Ramsgate by the earliest train on the following\nmorning, and was not long in finding out the \"Fiddle with One\nString.\" The \"Fiddle with One String\" was a public-house, very humble\nin appearance, in the outskirts of the town, on the road leading to\nPegwell Bay. On this occasion Mr. Gager was dressed in his ordinary\nplain clothes, and though the policeman's calling might not be\nso manifestly declared by his appearance at Ramsgate as it was\nin Scotland Yard,--still, let a hint in that direction have ever\nbeen given, and the ordinary citizens of Ramsgate would at once\nbe convinced that the man was what he was. Gager had doubtless\nconsidered all the circumstances of his day's work carefully, and had\ndetermined that success would more probably attend him with this than\nwith any other line of action. He walked at once into the house, and\nasked whether a young woman was not lodging there. The man of the\nhouse was behind the bar, with his wife, and to him Gager whispered a\nfew words. The man stood dumb for a moment, and then his wife spoke.\n\"What's up now?\" said she. \"There's no young women here. We don't\nhave no young women.\" Then the man whispered a word to his wife,\nduring which Gager stood among the customers before the bar with an\neasy, unembarrassed air. \"Well, what's the odds?\" said the wife.\n\"There ain't anything wrong with us.\"\n\n\"Never thought there was, ma'am,\" said Gager. \"And there's nothing\nwrong as I know of with the young woman.\" Then the husband and wife\nconsulted together, and Mr. Gager was asked to take a seat in a\nlittle parlour, while the woman ran up-stairs for half an instant.\nGager looked about him quickly, and took in at a glance the system\nof the construction of the \"Fiddle with One String.\" He did sit down\nin the little parlour, with the door open, and remained there for\nperhaps a couple of minutes. Then he went to the front door, and\nglanced up at the roof. \"It's all right,\" said the keeper of the\nhouse, following him. \"She ain't a-going to get away. She ain't just\nvery well, and she's a-lying down.\"\n\n\"You tell her, with my regards,\" said Gager, \"that she needn't be a\nbit the worse because of me.\" The man looked at him suspiciously.\n\"You tell her what I say. And tell her, too, the quicker the better.\nShe has a gentleman a-looking after her, I daresay. Perhaps I'd\nbetter be off before he comes.\" The message was taken up to the lady,\nand Gager again seated himself in the little parlour.\n\nWe are often told that all is fair in love and war, and, perhaps,\nthe operation on which Mr. Gager was now intent may be regarded as\nwarlike. But he now took advantage of a certain softness in the\ncharacter of the lady whom he wished to meet, which hardly seems to\nbe justifiable even in a policeman. When Lizzie's tall footman had\nbeen in trouble about the necklace, a photograph had been taken\nfrom him which had not been restored to him. This was a portrait of\nPatience Crabstick, which she, poor girl, in a tender moment, had\ngiven to him who, had not things gone roughly with them, was to have\nbeen her lover. The little picture had fallen into Gager's hands, and\nhe now pulled it from his pocket. He himself had never visited the\nhouse in Hertford Street till after the second robbery, and, in the\nflesh, had not as yet seen Miss Crabstick; but he had studied her\nface carefully, expecting, or, at any rate, hoping, that he might\nsome day enjoy the pleasure of personal acquaintance. That pleasure\nwas now about to come to him, and he prepared himself for it by\nmaking himself intimate with the lines of the lady's face as the sun\nhad portrayed them. There was even yet some delay, and Mr. Gager more\nthan once testified uneasiness. \"She ain't a-going to get away,\" said\nthe mistress of the house, \"but a lady as is going to see a gentleman\ncan't jump into her things as a man does.\" Gager intimated his\nacquiescence in all this, and again waited.\n\n\"The sooner she comes the less trouble for her,\" said Gager to the\nwoman; \"if you'll only make her believe that.\" At last, when he\nhad been somewhat over an hour in the house, he was asked to walk\nup-stairs, and then, in a little sitting-room over the bar, he had\nthe opportunity, so much desired, of making personal acquaintance\nwith Patience Crabstick.\n\nIt may be imagined that the poor waiting-woman had not been in a\nhappy state of mind since she had been told that a gentleman was\nwaiting to see her down-stairs, who had declared himself to be a\npoliceman immediately on entering the shop. To escape was of course\nher first idea, but she was soon made to understand that this was\nimpracticable. In the first place there was but one staircase, at the\nbottom of which was the open door of the room in which the policeman\nwas sitting; and then, the woman of the house was very firm in\ndeclaring that she would connive at nothing which might cost her and\nher husband their licence. \"You've got to face it,\" said the woman.\n\"I suppose they can't make me get out of bed unless I pleases,\" said\nPatience firmly. But she knew that even that resource would fail her,\nand that a policeman, when aggravated, can take upon him all the\nduties of a lady's maid. She had to face it,--and she did face it.\n\"I've just got to have a few words with you, my dear,\" said Gager.\n\n\"I suppose, then, we'd better be alone,\" said Patience; whereupon the\nwoman of the house discreetly left the room.\n\nThe interview was so long that the reader would be fatigued were he\nasked to study a record of all that was said on the occasion. The\ngentleman and lady were closeted together for more than an hour,\nand so amicably was the conversation carried on that when the time\nwas half over Gager stepped down-stairs and interested himself in\nprocuring Miss Crabstick's breakfast. He even condescended himself to\npick a few shrimps and drink a glass of beer in her company. A great\ndeal was said, and something was even settled, as may be learned from\na few concluding words of that very memorable conversation. \"Just\ndon't you say anything about it, my dear, but leave word for him that\nyou've gone up to town on business.\"\n\n\"Lord love you, Mr. Gager, he'll know all about it.\"\n\n\"Let him know. Of course he'll know,--if he comes down. It's my\nbelief he'll never show himself at Ramsgate again.\"\n\n\"But, Mr. Gager--\"\n\n\"Well, my dear?\"\n\n\"You aren't a perjuring of yourself?\"\n\n\"What;--about making you my wife? That I ain't. I'm upright, and\nalways was. There's no mistake about me when you've got my word. As\nsoon as this work is off my mind, you shall be Mrs. Gager, my dear.\nAnd you'll be all right. You've been took in, that's what you have.\"\n\n\"That I have, Mr. Gager,\" said Patience, wiping her eyes.\n\n\"You've been took in, and you must be forgiven.\"\n\n\"I didn't get--not nothing out of the necklace; and as for the other\nthings, they've frighted me so, that I let 'em all go for just what I\ntell you. And as for Mr. Smiler,--I never didn't care for him; that I\ndidn't. He ain't the man to touch my heart,--not at all; and it was\nnot likely either. A plain fellow,--very, Mr. Gager.\"\n\n\"He'll be plainer before long, my dear.\"\n\n\"But I've been that worrited among 'em, Mr. Gager, since first they\nmade their wicked prepositions, that I've been jest-- I don't know\nhow I've been. And though my lady was not a lady as any girl could\nlike, and did deserve to have her things took if anybody's things\never should be took, still, Mr. Gager, I knows I did wrong. I do know\nit,--and I'm a-repenting of it in sackcloth and ashes;--so I am. But\nyou'll be as good as your word, Mr. Gager?\"\n\nIt must be acknowledged that Mr. Gager had bidden high for success,\nand had allowed himself to be carried away by his zeal almost to the\nverge of imprudence. It was essential to him that he should take\nPatience Crabstick back with him to London,--and that he should take\nher as a witness and not as a criminal. Mr. Benjamin was the game at\nwhich he was flying,--Mr. Benjamin, and, if possible, Lord George;\nand he conceived that his net might be big enough to hold Smiler as\nwell as the other two greater fishes, if he could induce Patience\nCrabstick and Billy Cann to co-operate with him cordially in his\nfishing.\n\nBut his mind was still disturbed on one point. Let him press his\nbeloved Patience as closely as he might with questions, there was one\npoint on which he could not get from her what he believed to be the\ntruth. She persisted that Lord George de Bruce Carruthers had had no\nhand in either robbery, and Gager had so firmly committed himself to\na belief on this matter, that he could not throw the idea away from\nhim, even on the testimony of Patience Crabstick.\n\nOn that evening he returned triumphant to Scotland Yard with Patience\nCrabstick under his wing; and that lady was housed there with every\ncomfort she could desire, except that of personal liberty.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIX\n\nMr. Gowran Up in London\n\n\nIn the meantime Mrs. Hittaway was diligently spreading a report that\nLizzie Eustace either was engaged to marry her cousin Frank,--or\nought to be so engaged. This she did, no doubt, with the sole object\nof saving her brother; but she did it with a zeal that dealt as\nfreely with Frank's name as with Lizzie's. They, with all their\nfriends, were her enemies, and she was quite sure that they were,\naltogether, a wicked, degraded set of people. Of Lord George and\nMrs. Carbuncle, of Miss Roanoke and Sir Griffin Tewett, she believed\nall manner of evil. She had theories of her own about the jewels,\nstories,--probably of her own manufacture in part, although no doubt\nshe believed them to be true,--as to the manner of living at Portray,\nlittle histories of Lizzie's debts, and the great fact of the scene\nwhich Mr. Gowran had seen with his own eyes. Lizzie Eustace was an\nabomination to her, and this abominable woman her brother was again\nin danger of marrying! She was very loud in her denunciations, and\ntook care that they should reach even Lady Linlithgow, so that\npoor Lucy Morris might know of what sort was the lover in whom she\ntrusted. Andy Gowran had been sent for to town, and was on his\njourney while Mr. Gager was engaged at Ramsgate. It was at present\nthe great object of Mrs. Hittaway's life to induce her brother to see\nMr. Gowran before he kept his appointment with Lady Eustace.\n\nPoor Lucy received the wound which was intended for her. The enemy's\nweapons had repeatedly struck her, but hitherto they had alighted on\nthe strong shield of her faith. But let a shield be never so strong,\nit may at last be battered out of all form and service. On Lucy's\nshield there had been much of such batterings, and the blows which\nhad come from him in whom she most trusted had not been the lightest.\nShe had not seen him for months, and his letters were short,\nunsatisfactory, and rare. She had declared to herself and to her\nfriend Lady Fawn, that no concurrence of circumstances, no absence,\nhowever long, no rumours that might reach her ears, would make\nher doubt the man she loved. She was still steadfast in the same\nresolution; but in spite of her resolution her heart began to fail\nher. She became weary, unhappy, and ill at ease, and though she would\nnever acknowledge to herself that she doubted, she did doubt.\n\n\"So, after all, your Mr. Greystock is to marry my niece, Lizzie\nGreystock.\" This good-natured speech was made one morning to poor\nLucy by her present patroness, Lady Linlithgow.\n\n\"I rather think not,\" said Lucy plucking up her spirits and smiling\nas she spoke.\n\n\"Everybody says so. As for Lizzie, she has become quite a heroine.\nWhat with her necklace, and her two robberies, and her hunting,\nand her various lovers,--two lords and a member of Parliament, my\ndear,--there is nothing to equal her. Lady Glencora Palliser has been\ncalling on her. She took care to let me know that. And I'm now told\nthat she certainly is engaged to her cousin.\"\n\n\"According to your own showing, Lady Linlithgow, she has got two\nother lovers. Couldn't you oblige me by letting her marry one of the\nlords?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid, my dear, that Mr. Greystock is to be the chosen one.\"\nThen after a pause the old woman became serious. \"What is the use,\nMiss Morris, of not looking the truth in the face? Mr. Greystock is\nneglecting you.\"\n\n\"He is not neglecting me. You won't let him come to see me.\"\n\n\"Certainly not;--but if he were not neglecting you, you would not be\nhere. And there he is with Lizzie Eustace every day of his life. He\ncan't afford to marry you, and he can afford to marry her. It's a\ndeal better that you should look it all in the face and know what it\nmust all come to.\"\n\n\"I shall just wait,--and never believe a word till he speaks it.\"\n\n\"You hardly know what men are, my dear.\"\n\n\"Very likely not, Lady Linlithgow. It may be that I shall have to\npay dear for learning. Of course, I may be mistaken as well as\nanother,--only I don't believe I am mistaken.\"\n\nWhen this little scene took place, only a month remained of the time\nfor which Lucy's services were engaged to Lady Linlithgow, and no\ndefinite arrangement had been made as to her future residence. Lady\nFawn was prepared to give her a home, and to Lady Fawn, as it seemed,\nshe must go. Lady Linlithgow had declared herself unwilling to\ncontinue the existing arrangement because, as she said, it did not\nsuit her that her companion should be engaged to marry her late\nsister's nephew. Not a word had been said about the deanery for the\nlast month or two, and Lucy, though her hopes in that direction had\nonce been good, was far too high-spirited to make any suggestion\nherself as to her reception by her lover's family. In the ordinary\ncourse of things she would have to look out for another situation,\nlike any other governess in want of a place; but she could do this\nonly by consulting Lady Fawn; and Lady Fawn when consulted would\nalways settle the whole matter by simply bidding her young friend to\ncome to Fawn Court.\n\nThere must be some end of her living at Fawn Court. So much Lucy told\nherself over and over again. It could be but a temporary measure.\nIf--if it was to be her fate to be taken away from Fawn Court a\nhappy, glorious, triumphant bride, then the additional obligation put\nupon her by her dear friends would not be more than she could bear.\nBut to go to Fawn Court, and, by degrees, to have it acknowledged\nthat another place must be found for her, would be very bad. She\nwould infinitely prefer any intermediate hardship. How, then, should\nshe know? As soon as she was able to escape from the countess, she\nwent up to her own room, and wrote the following letter. She studied\nthe words with great care as she wrote them,--sitting and thinking\nbefore she allowed her pen to run on the paper.\n\n\n   MY DEAR FRANK,\n\n   It is a long time since we met;--is it not? I do not write\n   this as a reproach; but because my friends tell me that I\n   should not continue to think myself engaged to you. They\n   say that, situated as you are, you cannot afford to marry\n   a penniless girl, and that I ought not to wish you to\n   sacrifice yourself. I do understand enough of your affairs\n   to know that an imprudent marriage may ruin you, and I\n   certainly do not wish to be the cause of injury to you.\n   All I ask is that you should tell me the truth. It is not\n   that I am impatient; but that I must decide what to do\n   with myself when I leave Lady Linlithgow.\n\n   Your most affectionate friend,\n\n   LUCY MORRIS.\n\n   March 2, 18--.\n\n\nShe read this letter over and over again, thinking of all that\nit said and of all that it omitted to say. She was at first half\ndisposed to make protestations of forgiveness,--to assure him that\nnot even within her own heart would she reproach him, should he feel\nhimself bound to retract the promise he had made her. She longed to\nbreak out into love, but so to express her love that her lover should\nknow that it was strong enough even to sacrifice itself for his sake.\nBut though her heart longed to speak freely, her judgment told her\nthat it would be better that she should be reticent and tranquil in\nher language. Any warmth on her part would be in itself a reproach to\nhim. If she really wished to assist him in extricating himself from a\ndifficulty into which he had fallen in her behalf, she would best do\nso by offering him his freedom in the fewest and plainest words which\nshe could select.\n\nBut even when the letter was written she doubted as to the wisdom of\nsending it. She kept it that she might sleep upon it. She did sleep\nupon it,--and when the morning came she would not send it. Had not\nabsolute faith in her lover been the rock on which she had declared\nto herself that she would build the house of her future hopes? Had\nnot she protested again and again that no caution from others should\ninduce her to waver in her belief? Was it not her great doctrine to\ntrust,--to trust implicitly, even though all should be lost if her\ntrust should be misplaced? And was it well that she should depart\nfrom all this, merely because it might be convenient for her to make\narrangements as to the coming months? If it were to be her fate to be\nrejected, thrown over, and deceived, of what use to her could be any\nfuture arrangements? All to her would be ruin, and it would matter\nto her nothing whither she should be taken. And then, why should\nshe lie to him as she would lie in sending such a letter? If he did\nthrow her over he would be a traitor, and her heart would be full of\nreproaches. Whatever might be his future lot in life, he owed it to\nher to share it with her, and if he evaded his debt he would be a\ntraitor and a miscreant. She would never tell him so. She would be\nfar too proud to condescend to spoken or written reproaches. But\nshe would know that it would be so, and why should she lie to him\nby saying that it would not be so? Thinking of all this, when the\nmorning came, she left the letter lying within her desk.\n\nLord Fawn was to call upon Lady Eustace on the Saturday, and on\nFriday afternoon Mr. Andrew Gowran was in Mrs. Hittaway's back\nparlour in Warwick Square. After many efforts, and with much\npersuasion, the brother had agreed to see his sister's great witness.\nLord Fawn had felt that he would lower himself by any intercourse\nwith such a one as Andy Gowran in regard to the conduct of the woman\nwhom he had proposed to make his wife, and had endeavoured to avoid\nthe meeting. He had been angry, piteous, haughty, and sullen by\nturns; but Mrs. Hittaway had overcome him by dogged perseverance;\nand poor Lord Fawn had at last consented. He was to come to Warwick\nSquare as soon as the House was up on Friday evening, and dine there.\nBefore dinner he was to be introduced to Mr. Gowran. Andy arrived at\nthe house at half-past five, and after some conversation with Mrs.\nHittaway, was left there all alone to await the coming of Lord Fawn.\nHe was in appearance and manners very different from the Andy Gowran\nfamiliarly known among the braes and crofts of Portray. He had a\nheavy stiff hat, which he carried in his hand. He wore a black\nswallow-tail coat and black trousers, and a heavy red waistcoat\nbuttoned up nearly to his throat, round which was tightly tied a\ndingy black silk handkerchief. At Portray no man was more voluble, no\nman more self-confident, no man more equal to his daily occupations\nthan Andy Gowran; but the unaccustomed clothes, and the journey to\nLondon, and the town houses overcame him, and for a while almost\nsilenced him. Mrs. Hittaway found him silent, cautious, and timid.\nNot knowing what to do with him, fearing to ask him to go and eat in\nthe kitchen, and not liking to have meat and unlimited drink brought\nfor him into the parlour, she directed the servant to supply him\nwith a glass of sherry and a couple of biscuits. He had come an hour\nbefore the time named, and there, with nothing to cheer him beyond\nthese slight creature-comforts, he was left to wait all alone till\nLord Fawn should be ready to see him.\n\nAndy had seen lords before. Lords are not rarer in Ayrshire than\nin other Scotch counties; and then, had not Lord George de Bruce\nCarruthers been staying at Portray half the winter? But Lord George\nwas not to Andy a real lord,--and then a lord down in his own county\nwas so much less to him than a lord up in London. And this lord was\na lord of Parliament, and a government lord, and might probably have\nthe power of hanging such a one as Andy Gowran were he to commit\nperjury, or say anything which the lord might choose to call perjury.\nWhat it was that Lord Fawn wished him to say, he could not make\nhimself sure. That the lord's sister wished him to prove Lady Eustace\nto be all that was bad, he knew very well. But he thought that he was\nable to perceive that the brother and sister were not at one, and\nmore than once during his journey up to London he had almost made up\nhis mind that he would turn tail and go back to Portray. No doubt\nthere was enmity between him and his mistress; but then his mistress\ndid not attempt to hurt him even though he had insulted her grossly;\nand were she to tell him to leave her service, it would be from Mr.\nJohn Eustace, and not from Mrs. Hittaway, that he must look for\nthe continuation of his employment. Nevertheless he had taken Mrs.\nHittaway's money and there he was.\n\nAt half-past seven Lord Fawn was brought into the room by his sister,\nand Andy Gowran, rising from his chair, three times ducked his head.\n\"Mr. Gowran,\" said Mrs. Hittaway, \"my brother is desirous that you\nshould tell him exactly what you have seen of Lady Eustace's conduct\ndown at Portray. You may speak quite freely, and I know you will\nspeak truly.\" Andy again ducked his head. \"Frederic,\" continued the\nlady, \"I am sure that you may implicitly believe all that Mr. Gowran\nwill say to you.\" Then Mrs. Hittaway left the room,--as her brother\nhad expressly stipulated that she should do.\n\nLord Fawn was quite at a loss how to begin, and Andy was by no means\nprepared to help him. \"If I am rightly informed,\" said the lord, \"you\nhave been for many years employed on the Portray property?\"\n\n\"A' my life,--so please your lairdship.\"\n\n\"Just so;--just so. And, of course, interested in the welfare of the\nEustace family?\"\n\n\"Nae doobt, my laird,--nae doobt; vera interasted indeed.\"\n\n\"And being an honest man, have felt sorrow that the Portray property\nshould--should--should--; that anything bad should happen to it.\"\nAndy nodded his head, and Lord Fawn perceived that he was nowhere\nnear the beginning of his matter. \"Lady Eustace is at present your\nmistress?\"\n\n\"Just in a fawshion, my laird,--as a mon may say. That is she\nis,--and she is nae. There's a mony things at Portray as ha' to be\nlookit after.\"\n\n\"She pays you your wages?\" said Lord Fawn shortly.\n\n\"Eh;--wages! Yes, my laird; she does a' that.\"\n\n\"Then she's your mistress.\" Andy again nodded his head, and Lord\nFawn again struggled to find some way in which he might approach his\nsubject. \"Her cousin, Mr. Greystock, has been staying at Portray\nlately?\"\n\n\"More coothie than coosinly,\" said Andy, winking his eye.\n\nIt was dreadful to Lord Fawn that the man should wink his eye at\nhim. He did not quite understand what Andy had last said, but he did\nunderstand that some accusation as to indecent familiarity with her\ncousin was intended to be brought by this Scotch steward against the\nwoman to whom he had engaged himself. Every feeling of his nature\nrevolted against the task before him, and he found that on trial\nit became absolutely impracticable. He could not bring himself to\ninquire minutely as to poor Lizzie's flirting down among the rocks.\nHe was weak, and foolish, and in many respects ignorant,--but he was\na gentleman. As he got nearer to the point which it had been intended\nthat he should reach, the more he hated Andy Gowran,--and the more\nhe hated himself for having submitted to such contact. He paused a\nmoment, and then he declared that the conversation was at an end.\n\"I think that will do, Mr. Gowran,\" he said. \"I don't know that you\ncan tell me anything I want to hear. I think you had better go back\nto Scotland.\" So saying, he left Andy alone and stalked up to the\ndrawing-room. When he entered it, both Mr. Hittaway and his sister\nwere there. \"Clara,\" he said very sternly, \"you had better send some\none to dismiss that man. I shall not speak to him again.\"\n\nLord Fawn did not speak to Andy Gowran again, but Mrs. Hittaway did.\nAfter a faint and futile endeavour made by her to ascertain what had\ntaken place in the parlour down-stairs, she descended and found Andy\nseated in his chair, still holding his hat in his hand, as stiff as a\nwax figure. He had been afraid of the lord, but as soon as the lord\nhad left him he was very angry with the lord. He had been brought up\nall that way to tell his story to the lord, and the lord had gone\naway without hearing a word of it,--had gone away and had absolutely\ninsulted him, had asked him who paid him his wages, and had then told\nhim that Lady Eustace was his mistress. Andy Gowran felt strongly\nthat this was not that kind of confidential usage which he had had\na right to expect. And after his experience of the last hour and a\nhalf, he did not at all relish his renewed solitude in that room.\n\"A drap of puir thin liquor,--poored out, too, in a weeny glass\nnae deeper than an egg-shell,--and twa cookies; that's what she\nca'ed--rafrashment!\" It was thus that Andy afterwards spoke to his\nwife of the hospitalities offered to him in Warwick Square, regarding\nwhich his anger was especially hot, in that he had been treated like\na child or a common labourer, instead of having the decanter left\nwith him to be used at his own discretion. When, therefore, Mrs.\nHittaway returned to him, the awe with which new circumstances and\nthe lord had filled him was fast vanishing, and giving place to that\nstubborn indignation against people in general which was his normal,\ncondition. \"I suppose I'm jist to gang bock again to Portray, Mrs.\nHeetaway, and that'll be a' you'll want o' me?\" This he said the\nmoment the lady entered the room.\n\nBut Mrs. Hittaway did not want to lose his services quite so soon.\nShe expressed regret that her brother should have found himself\nunable to discuss a subject that was naturally so very distasteful\nto him, and begged Mr. Gowran to come to her again the next morning.\n\"What I saw wi' my ain twa e'es, Mrs. Heetaway, I saw,--and nane\nthe less because his lairdship may nae find it jist tastefu', as\nyour leddyship was saying. There were them twa, a' colloguing, and\na-seetting ilk in ither's laps a' o'er, and a-keessing,--yes, my\nleddy, a-keessing as females, not to say males, ought nae to keess,\nunless they be mon and wife,--and then not amang the rocks, my leddy;\nand if his lairdship does nae care to hear tell o' it, and finds it\nnae tastefu', as your leddyship was saying, he should nae ha' sent\nfor Andy Gowran a' the way from Portray, jist to tell him what he\nwanna hear, now I'm come to tell't to him!\"\n\nAll this was said with so much unction that even Mrs. Hittaway\nherself found it to be not \"tasteful.\" She shrunk and shivered under\nMr. Gowran's eloquence, and almost repented of her zeal. But women,\nperhaps, feel less repugnance than do men at using ignoble assistance\nin the achievement of good purposes. Though Mrs. Hittaway shrunk and\nshivered under the strong action with which Mr. Gowran garnished his\nstrong words, still she was sure of the excellence of her purpose;\nand, believing that useful aid might still be obtained from Andy\nGowran, and, perhaps, prudently anxious to get value in return for\nthe cost of the journey up from Ayrshire, she made the man promise to\nreturn to her on the following morning.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LX\n\n\"Let It Be As Though It Had Never Been\"\n\n\nBetween her son, and her married daughter, and Lucy Morris, poor Lady\nFawn's life had become a burthen to her. Everything was astray, and\nthere was no happiness or tranquillity at Fawn Court. Of all simply\nhuman creeds the strongest existing creed for the present in the\nminds of the Fawn ladies was that which had reference to the general\niniquity of Lizzie Eustace. She had been the cause of all these\nsorrows, and she was hated so much the more because she had not been\nproved to be iniquitous before all the world. There had been a time\nwhen it seemed to be admitted that she was so wicked in keeping the\ndiamonds in opposition to the continued demands made for them by\nMr. Camperdown, that all people would be justified in dropping her,\nand Lord Fawn among the number. But since the two robberies, public\nopinion had veered round three or four points in Lizzie's favour, and\npeople were beginning to say that she had been ill-used. Then had\ncome Mrs. Hittaway's evidence as to Lizzie's wicked doings down in\nScotland,--the wicked doings which Andy Gowran had described with a\nvehemence so terribly moral; and that which had been at first, as it\nwere, added to the diamonds, as a supplementary weight thrown into\nthe scale, so that Lizzie's iniquities might bring her absolutely to\nthe ground, had gradually assumed the position of being the first\ncharge against her. Lady Fawn had felt no aversion to discussing the\ndiamonds. When Lizzie was called a \"thief,\" and a \"robber,\" and a\n\"swindler\" by one or another of the ladies of the family,--who, in\nusing those strong terms, whispered the words as ladies are wont to\ndo when they desire to lessen the impropriety of the strength of\ntheir language by the gentleness of the tone in which the words are\nspoken,--when Lizzie was thus described in Lady Fawn's hearing in her\nown house, she had felt no repugnance to it. It was well that the\nfact should be known, so that everybody might be aware that her son\nwas doing right in refusing to marry so wicked a lady. But when the\nother thing was added to it; when the story was told of what Mr.\nGowran had seen among the rocks, and when gradually that became the\nspecial crime which was to justify her son in dropping the lady's\nacquaintance, then Lady Fawn became very unhappy, and found the\nsubject to be, as Mrs. Hittaway had described it, very distasteful.\n\nAnd this trouble hit Lucy Morris as hard as it did Lord Fawn. If\nLizzie Eustace was unfit to marry Lord Fawn because of these things,\nthen was Frank Greystock not only unfit to marry Lucy, but most\nunlikely to do so, whether fit or unfit. For a week or two Lady Fawn\nhad allowed herself to share Lucy's joy, and to believe that Mr.\nGreystock would prove himself true to the girl whose heart he had\nmade all his own;--but she had soon learned to distrust the young\nmember of Parliament who was always behaving insolently to her son,\nwho spent his holidays down with Lizzie Eustace, who never visited\nand rarely wrote to the girl he had promised to marry, and as to whom\nall the world agreed in saying that he was far too much in debt to\nmarry any woman who had not means to help him. It was all sorrow and\nvexation together; and yet when her married daughter would press the\nsubject upon her, and demand her co-operation, she had no power of\nescaping. \"Mamma,\" Mrs. Hittaway had said, \"Lady Glencora Palliser\nhas been with her, and everybody is taking her up, and if her conduct\ndown in Scotland isn't proved, Frederic will be made to marry her.\"\n\"But what can I do, my dear?\" Lady Fawn had asked, almost in tears.\n\"Insist that Frederic shall know the whole truth,\" replied Mrs.\nHittaway with energy. \"Of course, it is very disagreeable. Nobody\ncan feel it more than I do. It is horrible to have to talk about\nsuch things,--and to think of them.\" \"Indeed it is, Clara,--very\nhorrible.\" \"But anything, mamma, is better than that Frederic should\nbe allowed to marry such a woman as that. It must be proved to\nhim--how unfit she is to be his wife.\" With the view of carrying out\nthis intention, Mrs. Hittaway had, as we have seen, received Andy\nGowran at her own house; and with the same view she took Andy Gowran\nthe following morning down to Richmond.\n\nMrs. Hittaway, and her mother, and Andy were closeted together for\nhalf an hour, and Lady Fawn suffered grievously. Lord Fawn had found\nthat he couldn't hear the story, and he had not heard it. He had been\nstrong enough to escape, and had, upon the whole, got the best of\nit in the slight skirmish which had taken place between him and the\nScotchman; but poor old Lady Fawn could not escape. Andy was allowed\nto be eloquent, and the whole story was told to her, though she would\nalmost sooner have been flogged at a cart's tail than have heard it.\nThen \"rafrashments\" were administered to Andy of a nature which made\nhim prefer Fawn Court to Warwick Square, and he was told that he\nmight go back to Portray as soon as he pleased.\n\nWhen he was gone, Mrs. Hittaway opened her mind to her mother\naltogether. \"The truth is, mamma, that Frederic will marry her.\"\n\n\"But why? I thought that he had declared that he would give it up. I\nthought that he had said so to herself.\"\n\n\"What of that, if he retracts what he said? He is so weak. Lady\nGlencora Palliser has made him promise to go and see her; and he is\nto go to-day. He is there now, probably,--at this very moment. If he\nhad been firm, the thing was done. After all that has taken place,\nnobody would ever have supposed that his engagement need go for\nanything. But what can he say to her now that he is with her, except\njust do the mischief all over again? I call it quite wicked in\nthat woman's interfering. I do, indeed! She's a nasty, insolent,\nimpertinent creature;--that's what she is! After all the trouble I've\ntaken, she comes and undoes it all with one word.\"\n\n\"What can we do, Clara?\"\n\n\"Well;--I do believe that if Frederic could be made to act as he\nought to do, just for a while, she would marry her cousin, Mr.\nGreystock, and then there would be an end of it altogether. I really\nthink that she likes him best, and from all that I can hear, she\nwould take him now, if Frederic would only keep out of the way. As\nfor him, of course he is doing his very best to get her. He has not\none shilling to rub against another, and is over head and ears in\ndebt.\"\n\n\"Poor Lucy!\" ejaculated Lady Fawn.\n\n\"Well;--yes; but really that is a matter of course. I always thought,\nmamma, that you and Amelia were a little wrong to coax her up in that\nbelief.\"\n\n\"But, my dear, the man proposed for her in the plainest possible\nmanner. I saw his letter.\"\n\n\"No doubt;--men do propose. We all know that. I'm sure I don't know\nwhat they get by it, but I suppose it amuses them. There used to be a\nsort of feeling that if a man behaved badly something would be done\nto him; but that's all over now. A man may propose to whom he likes,\nand if he chooses to say afterwards that it doesn't mean anything,\nthere's nothing in the world to bring him to book.\"\n\n\"That's very hard,\" said the elder lady, of whom everybody said that\nshe did not understand the world as well as her daughter.\n\n\"The girls,--they all know that it is so, and I suppose it comes to\nthe same thing in the long run. The men have to marry, and what one\ngirl loses another girl gets.\"\n\n\"It will kill Lucy.\"\n\n\"Girls ain't killed so easy, mamma;--not now-a-days. Saying that it\nwill kill her won't change the man's nature. It wasn't to be expected\nthat such a man as Frank Greystock, in debt, and in Parliament, and\ngoing to all the best houses, should marry your governess. What was\nhe to get by it? That's what I want to know.\"\n\n\"I suppose he loved her.\"\n\n\"Laws, mamma, how antediluvian you are! No doubt he did like\nher,--after his fashion; though what he saw in her, I never could\ntell. I think Miss Morris would make a very nice wife for a country\nclergyman who didn't care how poor things were. But she has no\nstyle;--and as far as I can see, she has no beauty. Why should such a\nman as Frank Greystock tie himself by the leg for ever to such a girl\nas that? But, mamma, he doesn't mean to marry Lucy Morris. Would he\nhave been going on in that way with his cousin down in Scotland had\nhe meant it? He means nothing of the kind. He means to marry Lady\nEustace's income if he can get it;--and she would marry him before\nthe summer if only we could keep Frederic away from her.\"\n\nMrs. Hittaway demanded from her mother that in season and out of\nseason she should be urgent with Lord Fawn, impressing upon him the\nnecessity of waiting, in order that he might see how false Lady\nEustace was to him; and also that she should teach Lucy Morris how\nvain were all her hopes. If Lucy Morris would withdraw her claims\naltogether the thing might probably be more quickly and more surely\nmanaged. If Lucy could be induced to tell Frank that she withdrew her\nclaim, and that she saw how impossible it was that they should ever\nbe man and wife, then,--so argued Mrs. Hittaway,--Frank would at once\nthrow himself at his cousin's feet, and all the difficulty would\nbe over. The abominable, unjustifiable, and insolent interference\nof Lady Glencora just at the present moment would be the means\nof undoing all the good that had been done, unless it could be\nneutralised by some such activity as this. The necklace had\nabsolutely faded away into nothing. The sly creature was almost\nbecoming a heroine on the strength of the necklace. The very mystery\nwith which the robberies were pervaded was acting in her favour.\nLord Fawn would absolutely be made to marry her,--forced into it by\nLady Glencora and that set,--unless the love affair between her and\nher cousin, of which Andy Gowran was able to give such sufficient\ntestimony, could in some way be made available to prevent it.\n\nThe theory of life and system on which social matters should be\nmanaged, as displayed by her married daughter, was very painful to\npoor old Lady Fawn. When she was told that under the new order of\nthings promises from gentlemen were not to be looked upon as binding,\nthat love was to go for nothing, that girls were to be made contented\nby being told that when one lover was lost another could be found,\nshe was very unhappy. She could not disbelieve it all, and throw\nherself back upon her faith in virtue, constancy, and honesty. She\nrather thought that things had changed for the worse since she was\nyoung, and that promises were not now as binding as they used to be.\nShe herself had married into a Liberal family, had a Liberal son, and\nwould have called herself a Liberal; but she could not fail to hear\nfrom others, her neighbours, that the English manners, and English\nprinciples, and English society were all going to destruction in\nconsequence of the so-called liberality of the age. Gentlemen, she\nthought, certainly did do things which gentlemen would not have done\nforty years ago; and as for ladies,--they, doubtless, were changed\naltogether. Most assuredly she could not have brought an Andy Gowran\nto her mother to tell such tales in their joint presence as this man\nhad told!\n\nMrs. Hittaway had ridiculed her for saying that poor Lucy would die\nwhen forced to give up her lover. Mrs. Hittaway had spoken of the\nnecessity of breaking up that engagement without a word of anger\nagainst Frank Greystock. According to Mrs. Hittaway's views Frank\nGreystock had amused himself in the most natural way in the world\nwhen he asked Lucy to be his wife. A governess like Lucy had been\nquite foolish to expect that such a man as Greystock was in earnest.\nOf course she must give up her lover; and if there must be blame,\nshe must blame herself for her folly! Nevertheless, Lady Fawn was so\nsoft-hearted that she believed that the sorrow would crush Lucy, even\nif it did not kill her.\n\nBut not the less was it her duty to tell Lucy what she thought to be\nthe truth. The story of what had occurred among the rocks at Portray\nwas very disagreeable, but she believed it to be true. The man had\nbeen making love to his cousin after his engagement to Lucy. And\nthen, was it not quite manifest that he was neglecting poor Lucy in\nevery way? He had not seen her for nearly six months. Had he intended\nto marry her, would he not have found a home for her at the deanery?\nDid he in any respect treat her as he would treat the girl whom\nhe intended to marry? Putting all these things together, Lady\nFawn thought that she saw that Lucy's case was hopeless;--and, so\nthinking, wrote to her the following letter:--\n\n\n   Fawn Court, 3rd March, 18--.\n\n   DEAREST LUCY,\n\n   I have so much to say to you that I did think of getting\n   Lady Linlithgow to let you come to us here for a day, but\n   I believe it will perhaps be better that I should write.\n   I think you leave Lady Linlithgow after the first week in\n   April, and it is quite necessary that you should come to\n   some fixed arrangement as to the future. If that were all,\n   there need not be any trouble, as you will come here, of\n   course. Indeed, this is your natural home, as we all feel;\n   and I must say that we have missed you most terribly since\n   you went,--not only for Cecilia and Nina, but for all of\n   us. And I don't know that I should write at all if it\n   wasn't for something else, that must be said sooner or\n   later;--because, as to your coming here in April, that is\n   so much a matter of course. The only mistake was, that you\n   should ever have gone away. So we shall expect you here on\n   whatever day you may arrange with Lady Linlithgow as to\n   leaving her.\n\n\nThe poor, dear lady went on repeating her affectionate invitation,\nbecause of the difficulty she encountered in finding words with which\nto give the cruel counsel which she thought that it was her duty to\noffer.\n\n\n   And now, dearest Lucy, I must say what I believe to be the\n   truth about Mr. Greystock. I think that you should teach\n   yourself to forget him,--or, at any rate, that you should\n   teach yourself to forget the offer which he made to you\n   last autumn. Whether he was or was not in earnest then,\n   I think that he has now determined to forget it. I fear\n   there is no doubt that he has been making love to his\n   cousin, Lady Eustace. You well know that I should not\n   mention such a thing, if I had not the strongest possible\n   grounds to convince me that I ought to do so. But,\n   independent of this, his conduct to you during the last\n   six months has been such as to make us all feel sure that\n   the engagement is distasteful to him. He has probably\n   found himself so placed that he cannot marry without\n   money, and has wanted the firmness, or perhaps you will\n   say the hardness of heart, to say so openly. I am sure of\n   this, and so is Amelia, that it will be better for you\n   to give the matter up altogether, and to come here and\n   recover the blow among friends who will be as kind to you\n   as possible. I know all that you will feel, and you have\n   my fullest sympathy; but even such sorrows as that are\n   cured by time, and by the mercy of God, which is not only\n   infinite, but all-powerful.\n\n   Your most affectionate friend,\n\n   C. FAWN.\n\n\nLady Fawn, when she had written her letter, discussed it with Amelia,\nand the two together agreed that Lucy would never surmount the ill\neffects of the blow which was thus prophesied. \"As to saying it will\nkill her, mamma,\" said Amelia, \"I don't believe in that. If I were\nto break my leg, the accident might shorten my life, and this may\nshorten hers. It won't kill her in any other way. But it will alter\nher altogether. Nobody ever used to make herself happy so easily as\nLucy Morris; but all that will be gone now.\"\n\nWhen Lucy received the letter, the immediate effect upon her, the\neffect which came from the first reading of it, was not very great.\nShe succeeded for some half-hour in putting it aside, as referring\nto a subject on which she had quite made up her mind in a direction\ncontrary to that indicated by her correspondent's advice. Lady Fawn\ntold her that her lover intended to be false to her. She had thought\nthe matter over very carefully within the last day or two, and had\naltogether made up her mind that she would continue to trust her\nlover. She had abstained from sending to him the letter which she had\nwritten, and had abstained on that resolution. Lady Fawn, of course,\nwas as kind and friendly as a friend could be. She loved Lady Fawn\ndearly. But she was not bound to think Lady Fawn right, and in this\ninstance she did not think Lady Fawn right. So she folded up the\nletter and put it in her pocket.\n\nBut by putting the letter into her pocket she could not put it out\nof her mind. Though she had resolved, of what use to her was a\nresolution in which she could not trust? Day had passed by after day,\nweek after week, and month after month, and her very soul within her\nhad become sad for want of seeing this man, who was living almost in\nthe next street to her. She was ashamed to own to herself how many\nhours she had sat at the window, thinking that, perhaps, he might\nwalk before the house in which he knew that she was immured. And,\neven had it been impossible that he should come to her, the post was\nopen to him. She had scorned to write to him oftener than he would\nwrite to her, and now their correspondence had dwindled almost to\nnothing. He knew as well as did Lady Fawn when the period of her\nincarceration in Lady Linlithgow's dungeon would come to an end; and\nhe knew, too, how great had been her hope that she might be accepted\nas a guest at the deanery when that period should arrive. He knew\nthat she must look for a new home, unless he would tell her where\nshe should live. Was it likely,--was it possible, that he should be\nsilent so long if he still intended to make her his wife? No doubt he\nhad come to remember his debts, to remember his ambition, to think of\nhis cousin's wealth,--and to think also of his cousin's beauty. What\nright had she ever had to hope for such a position as that of his\nwife,--she who had neither money nor beauty,--she who had nothing\nto give him in return for his name and the shelter of his house\nbeyond her mind and her heart? As she thought of it all, she looked\ndown upon her faded grey frock, and stood up that she might glance\nat her features in the glass; and she saw how small she was and\ninsignificant, and reminded herself that all she had in the world\nwas a few pounds which she had saved and was still saving in order\nthat she might go to him with decent clothes upon her back. Was it\nreasonable that she should expect it?\n\nBut why had he come to her and made her thus wretched? She could\nacknowledge to herself that she had been foolish, vain, utterly\nignorant of her own value in venturing to hope; perhaps unmaidenly in\nallowing it to be seen that she had hoped;--but what was he in having\nfirst exalted her before all her friends, and then abasing her so\nterribly and bringing her to such utter shipwreck? From spoken or\nwritten reproaches she could, of course, abstain. She would neither\nwrite nor speak any;--but from unuttered reproaches how could she\nabstain? She had called him a traitor once in playful, loving irony,\nduring those few hours in which her love had been to her a luxury\nthat she could enjoy. But now he was a traitor indeed. Had he left\nher alone she would have loved him in silence, and not have been\nwretched in her love. She would, she knew, in that case, have had\nvigour enough and sufficient strength of character to bear her\nburthen without outward signs of suffering, without any inward\nsuffering that would have disturbed the current of her life. But now\neverything was over with her. She had no thought of dying, but her\nfuture life was a blank to her.\n\nShe came down-stairs to sit at lunch with Lady Linlithgow, and\nthe old woman did not perceive that anything was amiss with her\ncompanion. Further news had been heard of Lizzie Eustace, and of Lord\nFawn, and of the robberies, and the countess declared how she had\nread in the newspaper that one man was already in custody for the\nburglary at the house in Hertford Street. From that subject she\nwent on to tidings which had reached her from her old friend Lady\nClantantram that the Fawn marriage was on again. \"Not that I believe\nit, my dear; because I think that Mr. Greystock has made it quite\nsafe in that quarter.\" All this Lucy heard, and never showed by a\nsingle sign, or by a motion of a muscle, that she was in pain. Then\nLady Linlithgow asked her what she meant to do after the 5th of\nApril. \"I don't see at all why you shouldn't stay here, if you like\nit, Miss Morris;--that is, if you have abandoned the stupid idea of\nan engagement with Frank Greystock.\" Lucy smiled, and even thanked\nthe countess, and said that she had made up her mind to go back to\nRichmond for a month or two, till she could get another engagement\nas a governess. Then she returned to her room and sat again at her\nwindow, looking out upon the street.\n\nWhat did it matter now where she went? And yet she must go somewhere,\nand do something. There remained to her the wearisome possession of\nherself, and while she lived she must eat, and have clothes, and\nrequire shelter. She could not dawdle out a bitter existence under\nLady Fawn's roof, eating the bread of charity, hanging about the\nrooms and shrubberies useless and idle. How bitter to her was that\npossession of herself, as she felt that there was nothing good to be\ndone with the thing so possessed! She doubted even whether ever again\nshe could become serviceable as a governess, and whether the energy\nwould be left to her of earning her bread by teaching adequately the\nfew things that she knew. But she must make the attempt,--and must go\non making it, till God in his mercy should take her to himself.\n\nAnd yet but a few months since life had been so sweet to her! As\nshe felt this she was not thinking of those short days of excited,\nfeverish bliss in which she had believed that all the good things of\nthe world were to be showered into her lap; but of previous years\nin which everything had been with her as it was now,--with the one\nexception that she had not then been deceived. She had been full of\nsmiles, and humour, and mirth, absolutely happy among her friends,\nthough conscious of the necessity of earning her bread by the\nexercise of a most precarious profession,--while elated by no hope.\nThough she had loved the man and had been hopeless, she was happy.\nBut now, surely, of all maidens and of all women, she was the most\nforlorn.\n\nHaving once acceded to the truth of Lady Fawn's views, she abandoned\nall hope. Everybody said so, and it was so. There was no word from\nany side to encourage her. The thing was done and over, and she would\nnever mention his name again. She would simply beg of all the Fawns\nthat no allusion might be made to him in her presence. She would\nnever blame him, and certainly she would never praise him. As far as\nshe could rule her tongue, she would never have his name upon her\nlips again.\n\nShe thought for a time that she would send the letter which she had\nalready written. Any other letter she could not bring herself to\nwrite. Even to think of him was an agony to her; but to communicate\nher thoughts to him was worse than agony. It would be almost madness.\nWhat need was there for any letter? If the thing was done, it was\ndone. Perhaps there remained with her,--staying by her without her\nown knowledge, some faint spark of hope, that even yet he might\nreturn to her. At last she resolved that there should be no letter,\nand she destroyed that which she had written.\n\nBut she did write a note to Lady Fawn, in which she gratefully\naccepted her old friend's kindness till such time as she could \"find\na place.\" \"As to that other subject,\" she said, \"I know that you are\nright. Please let it all be as though it had never been.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXI\n\nLizzie's Great Friend\n\n\nThe Saturday morning came at last for which Lord Fawn had made his\nappointment with Lizzie, and a very important day it was in Hertford\nStreet,--chiefly on account of his lordship's visit, but also in\nrespect to other events which crowded themselves into the day. In the\ntelling of our tale, we have gone a little in advance of this, as it\nwas not till the subsequent Monday that Lady Linlithgow read in the\nnewspaper, and told Lucy, how a man had been arrested on account of\nthe robbery. Early on the Saturday morning Sir Griffin Tewett was\nin Hertford Street, and, as Lizzie afterwards understood, there\nwas a terrible scene between both him and Lucinda and him and Mrs.\nCarbuncle. She saw nothing of it herself, but Mrs. Carbuncle brought\nher the tidings. For the last few days Mrs. Carbuncle had been very\naffectionate in her manner to Lizzie, thereby showing a great change;\nfor during nearly the whole of February the lady, who in fact owned\nthe house, had hardly been courteous to her remunerative guest,\nexpressing more than once a hint that the arrangement which had\nbrought them together had better come to an end. \"You see, Lady\nEustace,\" Mrs. Carbuncle had once said, \"the trouble about these\nrobberies is almost too much for me.\" Lizzie, who was ill at the\ntime, and still trembling with constant fear on account of the lost\ndiamonds, had taken advantage of her sick condition, and declined\nto argue the question of her removal. Now she was supposed to be\nconvalescent, but Mrs. Carbuncle had returned to her former ways of\naffection. No doubt there was cause for this,--cause that was patent\nto Lizzie herself. Lady Glencora Palliser had called,--which thing\nalone was felt by Lizzie to alter her position altogether. And then,\nthough her diamonds were gone, and though the thieves who had stolen\nthem were undoubtedly aware of her secret as to the first robbery,\nthough she had herself told that secret to Lord George, whom she had\nnot seen since she had done so,--in spite of all these causes for\ntrouble, she had of late gradually found herself to be emerging\nfrom the state of despondency into which she had fallen while the\ndiamonds were in her own custody. She knew that she was regaining\nher ascendancy; and, therefore, when Mrs. Carbuncle came to tell her\nof the grievous things which had been said down-stairs between Sir\nGriffin and his mistress, and to consult her as to the future, Lizzie\nwas not surprised. \"I suppose the meaning of it is that the match\nmust be off,\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"Oh dear, no;--pray don't say anything so horrid after all that I\nhave gone through. Don't suggest anything of that kind to Lucinda.\"\n\n\"But surely after what you've told me now, he'll never come here\nagain.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, he will. There's no danger about his coming back. It's only\na sort of a way he has.\"\n\n\"A very disagreeable way,\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"No doubt, Lady Eustace. But then you know you can't have it all\nsweet. There must be some things disagreeable. As far as I can\nlearn, the property will be all right after a few years,--and it is\nabsolutely indispensable that Lucinda should do something. She has\naccepted him, and she must go on with it.\"\n\n\"She seems to me to be very unhappy, Mrs. Carbuncle.\"\n\n\"That was always her way. She was never gay and cheery like other\ngirls. I have never known her once to be what you would call happy.\"\n\n\"She likes hunting.\"\n\n\"Yes,--because she can gallop away out of herself. I have done all I\ncan for her, and she must go on with the marriage now. As for going\nback, it is out of the question. The truth is, we couldn't afford\nit.\"\n\n\"Then you must keep him in a better humour.\"\n\n\"I am not so much afraid about him; but, dear Lady Eustace, we want\nyou to help us a little.\"\n\n\"How can I help you?\"\n\n\"You can, certainly. Could you lend me two hundred and fifty pounds,\njust for six weeks?\" Lizzie's face fell and her eyes became very\nserious in their aspect. Two hundred and fifty pounds! \"You know you\nwould have ample security. You need not give Lucinda her present till\nI've paid you, and that will be forty-five pounds.\"\n\n\"Thirty-five,\" said Lizzie with angry decision.\n\n\"I thought we agreed upon forty-five when we settled about the\nservants' liveries;--and then you can let the man at the stables know\nthat I am to pay for the carriage and horses. You wouldn't be out of\nthe money hardly above a week or so, and it might be the salvation of\nLucinda just at present.\"\n\n\"Why don't you ask Lord George?\"\n\n\"Ask Lord George! He hasn't got it. It's much more likely that he\nshould ask me. I don't know what's come to Lord George this last\nmonth past. I did believe that you and he were to come together.\nI think these two robberies have upset him altogether. But, dear\nLizzie;--you can let me have it, can't you?\"\n\nLizzie did not at all like the idea of lending money, and by no means\nappreciated the security now offered to her. It might be very well\nfor her to tell the man at the stables that Mrs. Carbuncle would pay\nhim her bill, but how would it be with her if Mrs. Carbuncle did not\npay the bill? And as for her present to Lucinda,--which was to have\nbeen a present, and regarded by the future Lady Tewett as a voluntary\noffering of good-will and affection,--she was altogether averse to\nhaving it disposed of in this fashion. And yet she did not like to\nmake an enemy of Mrs. Carbuncle. \"I never was so poor in my life\nbefore,--not since I was married,\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"You can't be poor, dear Lady Eustace.\"\n\n\"They took my money out of my desk, you know,--ever so much.\"\n\n\"Forty-three pounds,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle, who was, of course, well\ninstructed in all the details of the robbery.\n\n\"And I don't suppose you can guess what the autumn cost me at\nPortray. The bills are only coming in now, and really they sometimes\nso frighten me that I don't know what I shall do. Indeed, I haven't\ngot the money to spare.\"\n\n\"You'll have every penny of it back in six weeks,\" said Mrs.\nCarbuncle, upon whose face a glow of anger was settling down. She\nquite intended to make herself very disagreeable to her \"dear Lady\nEustace\" or her \"dear Lizzie\" if she did not get what she wanted;\nand she knew very well how to do it. It must be owned that Lizzie\nwas afraid of the woman. It was almost impossible for her not to be\nafraid of the people with whom she lived. There were so many things\nagainst her;--so many sources of fear! \"I am quite sure you won't\nrefuse me such a trifling favour as this,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle, with\nthe glow of anger reddening more and more upon her brow.\n\n\"I don't think I have so much at the bankers,\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"They'll let you overdraw,--just as much as you please. If the cheque\ncomes back that will be my look out.\" Lizzie had tried that game\nbefore, and knew that the bankers would allow her to overdraw. \"Come,\nbe a good friend and do it at once,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle.\n\n\"Perhaps I can manage a hundred and fifty,\" said Lizzie, trembling.\nMrs. Carbuncle fought hard for the greater sum; but at last consented\nto take the less, and the cheque was written.\n\n\"This, of course, won't interfere with Lucinda's present,\" said Mrs.\nCarbuncle,--\"as we can make all this right by the horse and carriage\naccount.\" To this proposition, however, Lady Eustace made no answer.\n\nSoon after lunch, at which meal Miss Roanoke did not show herself,\nLady Glencora Palliser was announced, and sat for about ten minutes\nin the drawing-room. She had come, she said, especially to give the\nDuke of Omnium's compliments to Lady Eustace, and to express a wish\non the part of the duke that the lost diamonds might be recovered.\n\"I doubt,\" said Lady Glencora, \"whether there is any one in England\nexcept professed jewellers who knows so much about diamonds as his\ngrace.\"\n\n\"Or who has so many,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle, smiling graciously.\n\n\"I don't know about that. I suppose there are family diamonds, though\nI have never seen them. But he sympathises with you completely, Lady\nEustace. I suppose there is hardly hope now of recovering them.\"\nLizzie smiled and shook her head. \"Isn't it odd that they never\nshould have discovered the thieves? I'm told they haven't at all\ngiven it up,--only, unfortunately, they'll never get back the\nnecklace.\" She sat there for about a quarter of an hour, and then,\nas she took her leave, she whispered a few words to Lizzie. \"He is\nto come and see you;--isn't he?\" Lizzie assented with a smile, but\nwithout a word. \"I hope it will be all right,\" said Lady Glencora,\nand then she went.\n\nLizzie liked this friendship from Lady Glencora amazingly. Perhaps,\nafter all, nothing more would ever be known about the diamonds,\nand they would simply be remembered as having added a peculiar and\nnot injurious mystery to her life. Lord George knew,--but then\nshe trusted that a benevolent, true-hearted Corsair, such as was\nLord George, would never tell the story against her. The thieves\nknew,--but surely they, if not detected, would never tell. And if the\nstory were told by thieves, or even by a Corsair, at any rate half\nthe world would not believe it. What she had feared,--had feared till\nthe dread had nearly overcome her,--was public exposure at the hands\nof the police. If she could escape that, the world might still be\nbright before her. And the interest taken in her by such persons as\nthe Duke of Omnium and Lady Glencora was evidence not only that she\nhad escaped it hitherto, but also that she was in a fair way to\nescape it altogether. Three weeks ago she would have given up half\nher income to have been able to steal out of London without leaving\na trace behind her. Three weeks ago Mrs. Carbuncle was treating her\nwith discourtesy, and she was left alone nearly the whole day in\nher sick bedroom. Things were going better with her now. She was\nrecovering her position. Mr. Camperdown, who had been the first to\nattack her, was, so to say, \"nowhere.\" He had acknowledged himself\nbeaten. Lord Fawn, whose treatment to her had been so great an\ninjury, was coming to see her that very day. Her cousin Frank, though\nhe had never offered to marry her, was more affectionate to her than\never. Mrs. Carbuncle had been at her feet that morning borrowing\nmoney. And Lady Glencora Palliser,--the very leading star of\nfashion,--had called upon her twice! Why should she succumb? She had\nan income of four thousand pounds a year, and she thought that she\ncould remember that her aunt, Lady Linlithgow, had but seven hundred\npounds. Lady Fawn with all her daughters had not near so much as she\nhad. And she was beautiful, too, and young, and perfectly free to do\nwhat she pleased. No doubt the last eighteen months of her life had\nbeen made wretched by those horrid diamonds;--but they were gone, and\nshe had fair reason to hope that the very knowledge of them was gone\nalso.\n\nIn this condition would it be expedient for her to accept Lord Fawn\nwhen he came? She could not, of course, be sure that any renewed\noffer would be the result of his visit;--but she thought it probable\nthat with care she might bring him to that. Why should he come to her\nif he himself had no such intention? Her mind was quite made up on\nthis point,--that he should be made to renew his offer; but whether\nshe would renew her acceptance was quite another question. She had\nsworn to her cousin Frank that she would never do so, and she had\nsworn also that she would be revenged on this wretched lord. Now\nwould be her opportunity of accomplishing her revenge, and of proving\nto Frank that she had been in earnest. And she positively disliked\nthe man. That, probably, did not go for much, but it went for\nsomething, even with Lizzie Eustace. Her cousin she did like,--and\nLord George. She hardly knew which was her real love;--though, no\ndoubt, she gave the preference greatly to her cousin, because she\ncould trust him. And then Lord Fawn was very poor. The other two\nmen were poor also; but their poverty was not so objectionable in\nLizzie's eyes as were the respectable, close-fisted economies of\nLord Fawn. Lord Fawn, no doubt, had an assured income and a real\npeerage, and could make her a peeress. As she thought of it all, she\nacknowledged that there was a great deal to be said on each side, and\nthat the necessity of making up her mind then and there was a heavy\nburthen upon her.\n\nExactly at the hour named Lord Fawn came, and Lizzie was, of course,\nfound alone. That had been carefully provided. He was shown up, and\nshe received him very gracefully. She was sitting, and she rose from\nher chair, and put out her hand for him to take. She spoke no word\nof greeting, but looked at him with a pleasant smile, and stood\nfor a few seconds with her hand in his. He was awkward, and much\nembarrassed, and she certainly had no intention of lessening his\nembarrassment. \"I hope you are better than you have been,\" he said at\nlast.\n\n\"I am getting better, Lord Fawn. Will you not sit down?\" He then\nseated himself, placing his hat beside him on the floor, but at the\nmoment could not find words to speak. \"I have been very ill.\"\n\n\"I have been so sorry to hear it.\"\n\n\"There has been much to make me ill,--has there not?\"\n\n\"About the robbery, you mean?\"\n\n\"About many things. The robbery has been by no means the worst,\nthough, no doubt, it frightened me much. There were two robberies,\nLord Fawn.\"\n\n\"Yes,--I know that.\"\n\n\"And it was very terrible. And then, I had been threatened with a\nlawsuit. You have heard that, too?\"\n\n\"Yes,--I had heard it.\"\n\n\"I believe they have given that up now. I understand from my cousin,\nMr. Greystock, who has been my truest friend in all my troubles, that\nthe stupid people have found out at last that they had not a leg to\nstand on. I daresay you have heard that, Lord Fawn?\"\n\nLord Fawn certainly had heard, in a doubtful way, the gist of Mr.\nDove's opinion, namely, that the necklace could not be claimed from\nthe holder of it as an heirloom attached to the Eustace family. But\nhe had heard at the same time that Mr. Camperdown was as confident as\never that he could recover the property by claiming it after another\nfashion. Whether or no that claim had been altogether abandoned, or\nhad been allowed to fall into abeyance because of the absence of the\ndiamonds, he did not know, nor did any one know,--Mr. Camperdown\nhimself having come to no decision on the subject. But Lord Fawn had\nbeen aware that his sister had of late shifted the ground of her\ninveterate enmity to Lizzie Eustace, making use of the scene which\nMr. Gowran had witnessed, in lieu of the lady's rapacity in regard to\nthe necklace. It might therefore be assumed, Lord Fawn thought and\nfeared, that his strong ground in regard to the necklace had been cut\nfrom under his feet. But still, it did not behove him to confess that\nthe cause which he had always alleged as the ground for his retreat\nfrom the engagement was no cause at all. It might go hard with him\nshould an attempt be made to force him to name another cause. He knew\nthat he would lack the courage to tell the lady that he had heard\nfrom his sister that one Andy Gowran had witnessed a terrible scene\ndown among the rocks at Portray. So he sat silent, and made no answer\nto Lizzie's first assertion respecting the diamonds.\n\nBut the necklace was her strong point, and she did not intend that\nhe should escape the subject. \"If I remember right, Lord Fawn, you\nyourself saw that wretched old attorney once or twice on the\nsubject?\"\n\n\"I did see Mr. Camperdown, certainly. He is my own family lawyer.\"\n\n\"You were kind enough to interest yourself about the diamonds,--were\nyou not?\" She asked him this as a question, and then waited for a\nreply. \"Was it not so?\"\n\n\"Yes, Lady Eustace; it was so.\"\n\n\"They were of great value, and it was natural,\" continued Lizzie.\n\"Of course you interested yourself. Mr. Camperdown was full of awful\nthreats against me;--was he not? I don't know what he was not going\nto do. He stopped me in the street as I was driving to the station in\nmy own carriage, when the diamonds were with me;--which was a very\nstrong measure, I think. And he wrote me ever so many,--oh, such\nhorrid letters. And he went about telling everybody that it was an\nheirloom;--didn't he? You know all that, Lord Fawn?\"\n\n\"I know that he wanted to recover them.\"\n\n\"And did he tell you that he went to a real lawyer,--somebody who\nreally knew about it, Mr. Turbot, or Turtle, or some such name as\nthat, and the real lawyer told him that he was all wrong, and that\nthe necklace couldn't be an heirloom at all, because it belonged to\nme, and that he had better drop his lawsuit altogether? Did you hear\nthat?\"\n\n\"No;--I did not hear that.\"\n\n\"Ah, Lord Fawn, you dropped your inquiries just at the wrong place.\nNo doubt you had too many things to do in Parliament and the\nGovernment to go on with them; but if you had gone on, you would have\nlearned that Mr. Camperdown had just to give it up,--because he had\nbeen wrong from beginning to end.\" Lizzie's words fell from her with\nextreme rapidity, and she had become almost out of breath from the\neffects of her own energy.\n\nLord Fawn felt strongly the necessity of clinging to the diamonds as\nhis one great and sufficient justification. \"I thought,\" said he,\n\"that Mr. Camperdown had abandoned his action for the present because\nthe jewels had been stolen.\"\n\n\"Not a bit of it,\" said Lizzie, rising suddenly to her legs. \"Who\nsays so? Who dares to say so? Whoever says so is--is a storyteller. I\nunderstand all about that. The action could go on just the same, and\nI could be made to pay for the necklace out of my own income if it\nhadn't been my own. I am sure, Lord Fawn, such a clever man as you,\nand one who has always been in the Government and in Parliament,\ncan see that. And will anybody believe that such an enemy as Mr.\nCamperdown has been to me, persecuting me in every possible way,\ntelling lies about me to everybody,--who tried to prevent my dear,\ndarling husband from marrying me,--that he wouldn't go on with it if\nhe could?\"\n\n\"Mr. Camperdown is a very respectable man, Lady Eustace.\"\n\n\"Respectable! Talk to me of respectable after all that he has made me\nsuffer! As you were so fond of making inquiries, Lord Fawn, you ought\nto have gone on with them. You never would believe what my cousin\nsaid.\"\n\n\"Your cousin always behaved very badly to me.\"\n\n\"My cousin, who is a brother rather than a cousin, has known how to\nprotect me from the injuries done to me,--or, rather, has known how\nto take my part when I have been injured. My lord, as you have been\nunwilling to believe him, why have you not gone to that gentleman\nwho, as I say, is a real lawyer? I don't know, my lord, that it need\nhave concerned you at all, but as you began, you surely should have\ngone on with it. Don't you think so?\" She was still standing up,\nand, small as was her stature, was almost menacing the unfortunate\nUnder-Secretary of State, who was still seated in his chair. \"My\nlord,\" continued Lizzie, \"I have had great wrong done me.\"\n\n\"Do you mean by me?\"\n\n\"Yes, by you. Who else has done it?\"\n\n\"I do not think that I have done wrong to any one. I was obliged to\nsay that I could not recognise those diamonds as the property of my\nwife.\"\n\n\"But what right had you to say so? I had the diamonds when you asked\nme to be your wife.\"\n\n\"I did not know it.\"\n\n\"Nor did you know that I had this little ring upon my finger. Is it\nfit that you, or that any man should turn round upon a lady and say\nto her that your word is to be broken, and that she is to be exposed\nbefore all her friends, because you have taken a fancy to dislike her\nring or her brooch? I say, Lord Fawn, it was no business of yours,\neven after you were engaged to me. What jewels I might have, or not\nhave, was no concern of yours till after I had become your wife.\nGo and ask all the world if it is not so? You say that my cousin\naffronts you because he takes my part,--like a brother. Ask any one\nelse. Ask any lady you may know. Let us name some one to decide\nbetween us which of us has been wrong. Lady Glencora Palliser is a\nfriend of yours, and her husband is in the Government. Shall we name\nher? It is true, indeed, that her uncle, the Duke of Omnium, the\ngrandest and greatest of English noblemen, is specially interested on\nmy behalf.\" This was very fine in Lizzie. The Duke of Omnium she had\nnever seen; but his name had been mentioned to her by Lady Glencora,\nand she was quick to use it.\n\n\"I can admit of no reference to any one,\" said Lord Fawn.\n\n\"And I then,--what am I to do? I am to be thrown over simply because\nyour lordship--chooses to throw me over? Your lordship will admit no\nreference to any one! Your lordship makes inquiries as long as an\nattorney tells you stories against me, but drops them at once when\nthe attorney is made to understand that he is wrong. Tell me this,\nsir. Can you justify yourself,--in your own heart?\"\n\nUnfortunately for Lord Fawn, he was not sure that he could justify\nhimself. The diamonds were gone, and the action was laid aside, and\nthe general opinion which had prevailed a month or two since, that\nLizzie had been disreputably concerned in stealing her own necklace,\nseemed to have been laid aside. Lady Glencora and the duke went for\nalmost as much with Lord Fawn as they did with Lizzie. No doubt the\nmisbehaviour down among the rocks was left to him; but he had that\nonly on the evidence of Andy Gowran,--and even Andy Gowran's evidence\nhe had declined to receive otherwise than second-hand. Lizzie, too,\nwas prepared with an answer to this charge,--an answer which she had\nalready made more than once, though the charge was not positively\nbrought against her, and which consisted in an assertion that Frank\nGreystock was her brother rather than her cousin. Such brotherhood\nwas not altogether satisfactory to Lord Fawn, when he came once more\nto regard Lizzie Eustace as his possible future wife; but still the\nassertion was an answer, and one that he could not altogether reject.\n\nIt certainly was the case that he had again begun to think what would\nbe the result of a marriage with Lady Eustace. He must sever himself\naltogether from Mrs. Hittaway, and must relax the closeness of his\nrelations with Fawn Court. He would have a wife respecting whom he\nhimself had spread evil tidings, and the man whom he most hated\nin the world would be his wife's favourite cousin, or, so to\nsay,--brother. He would, after a fashion, be connected with Mrs.\nCarbuncle, Lord George de Bruce Carruthers, and Sir Griffin Tewett,\nall of whom he regarded as thoroughly disreputable. And, moreover, at\nhis own country house at Portray, as in such case it would be, his\nown bailiff or steward would be the man who had seen--what he had\nseen. These were great objections; but how was he to avoid marrying\nher? He was engaged to her. How, at any rate, was he to escape from\nthe renewal of his engagement at this moment? He had more than once\npositively stated that he was deterred from marrying her only by her\npossession of the diamonds. The diamonds were now gone.\n\nLizzie was still standing, waiting for an answer to her\nquestion,--Can you justify yourself in your own heart? Having paused\nfor some seconds, she repeated her question in a stronger and more\npersonal form. \"Had I been your sister, Lord Fawn, and had another\nman behaved to me as you have now done, would you say that he had\nbehaved well, and that she had no ground for complaint? Can you bring\nyourself to answer that question honestly?\"\n\n\"I hope I shall answer no question dishonestly.\"\n\n\"Answer it then. No; you cannot answer it, because you would condemn\nyourself. Now, Lord Fawn, what do you mean to do?\"\n\n\"I had thought, Lady Eustace, that any regard which you might ever\nhave entertained for me--\"\n\n\"Well;--what had you thought of my regard?\"\n\n\"That it had been dissipated.\"\n\n\"Have I told you so? Has any one come to you from me with such a\nmessage?\"\n\n\"Have you not received attentions from any one else?\"\n\n\"Attentions,--what attentions? I have received plenty of\nattentions,--most flattering attentions. I was honoured even this\nmorning by a most gratifying attention on the part of his grace the\nDuke of Omnium.\"\n\n\"I did not mean that.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, then? I am not going to marry the Duke of Omnium\nbecause of his attention,--nor any one else. If you mean, sir, after\nthe other inquiries you have done me the honour to make, to throw it\nin my face now, that I have--have in any way rendered myself unworthy\nof the position of your wife because people have been civil and kind\nto me in my sorrow, you are a greater dastard than I took you to be.\nTell me at once, sir, whom you mean.\"\n\nIt is hardly too much to say that the man quailed before her. And\nit certainly is not too much to say that, had Lizzie Eustace been\ntrained as an actress, she would have become a favourite with the\ntown. When there came to her any fair scope for acting, she was\nperfect. In the ordinary scenes of ordinary life, such as befell her\nduring her visit to Fawn Court, she could not acquit herself well.\nThere was no reality about her, and the want of it was strangely\nplain to most unobservant eyes. But give her a part to play that\nrequired exaggerated, strong action, and she hardly ever failed. Even\nin that terrible moment, when, on her return from the theatre, she\nthought that the police had discovered her secret about the diamonds,\nthough she nearly sank through fear, she still carried on her acting\nin the presence of Lucinda Roanoke; and when she had found herself\nconstrained to tell the truth to Lord George Carruthers, the power\nto personify a poor, weak, injured creature was not wanting to her.\nThe reader will not think that her position in society at the present\nmoment was very well established,--will feel, probably, that she must\nstill have known herself to be on the brink of social ruin. But she\nhad now fully worked herself up to the necessities of the occasion,\nand was as able to play her part as well as any actress that ever\nwalked the boards. She had called him a dastard, and now stood\nlooking him in the face. \"I didn't mean anybody in particular,\" said\nLord Fawn.\n\n\"Then what right can you have to ask me whether I have received\nattentions? Had it not been for the affectionate attention of my\ncousin, Mr. Greystock, I should have died beneath the load of sorrow\nyou have heaped upon me!\" This she said quite boldly, and yet the\nman she named was he of whom Andy Gowran told his horrid story, and\nwhose love-making to Lizzie had, in Mrs. Hittaway's opinion, been\nsufficient to atone for any falling off of strength in the matter of\nthe diamonds.\n\n\"A rumour reached me,\" said Lord Fawn, plucking up his courage, \"that\nyou were engaged to marry your cousin.\"\n\n\"Then rumour lied, my lord. And he or she who repeated the rumour to\nyou, lied also. And any he or she who repeats it again will go on\nwith the lie.\" Lord Fawn's brow became very black. The word \"lie\"\nitself was offensive to him,--offensive, even though it might not be\napplied directly to himself; but he still quailed, and was unable to\nexpress his indignation,--as he had done to poor Lucy Morris, his\nmother's governess. \"And now let me ask, Lord Fawn, on what ground\nyou and I stand together. When my friend, Lady Glencora, asked me,\nonly this morning, whether my engagement with you was still an\nexisting fact, and brought me the kindest possible message on the\nsame subject from her uncle, the duke, I hardly knew what answer to\nmake her.\" It was not surprising that Lizzie in her difficulties\nshould use her new friend, but perhaps she over-did the friendship a\nlittle. \"I told her that we were engaged, but that your lordship's\nconduct to me had been so strange, that I hardly knew how to speak of\nyou among my friends.\"\n\n\"I thought I explained myself to your cousin.\"\n\n\"My cousin certainly did not understand your explanation.\"\n\nLord Fawn was certain that Greystock had understood it well; and\nGreystock had in return insulted him,--because the engagement was\nbroken off. But it is impossible to argue on facts with a woman who\nhas been ill-used. \"After all that has passed, perhaps we had better\npart,\" said Lord Fawn.\n\n\"Then I shall put the matter into the hands of the Duke of Omnium,\"\nsaid Lizzie boldly. \"I will not have my whole life ruined, my good\nname blasted--\"\n\n\"I have not said a word to injure your good name.\"\n\n\"On what plea, then, have you dared to take upon yourself to\nput an end to an engagement which was made at your own pressing\nrequest,--which was, of course, made at your own request? On what\nground do you justify such conduct? You are a Liberal, Lord Fawn;\nand everybody regards the Duke of Omnium as the head of the Liberal\nnobility in England. He is my friend, and I shall put the matter into\nhis hands.\" It was, probably, from her cousin Frank that Lizzie had\nlearned that Lord Fawn was more afraid of the leaders of his own\nparty than of any other tribunal upon earth,--or perhaps elsewhere.\n\nLord Fawn felt the absurdity of the threat, and yet it had effect\nupon him. He knew that the Duke of Omnium was a worn-out old\ndebauchee, with one foot in the grave, who was looked after by two or\nthree women who were only anxious that he should not disgrace himself\nby some absurdity before he died. Nevertheless, the Duke of Omnium,\nor the duke's name, was a power in the nation. Lady Glencora was\ncertainly very powerful, and Lady Glencora's husband was Chancellor\nof the Exchequer. He did not suppose that the duke cared in the least\nwhether Lizzie Eustace was or was not married;--but Lady Glencora\nhad certainly interested herself about Lizzie, and might make London\nalmost too hot to hold him if she chose to go about everywhere\nsaying that he ought to marry the lady. And in addition to all this\nprospective grief, there was the trouble of the present moment. He\nwas in Lizzie's own room,--fool that he had been to come there,--and\nhe must get out as best he could. \"Lady Eustace,\" he said, \"I am most\nanxious not to behave badly in this matter.\"\n\n\"But you are behaving badly,--very badly.\"\n\n\"With your leave I will tell you what I would suggest. I will submit\nto you in writing my opinion on this matter;\"--Lord Fawn had been all\nhis life submitting his opinion in writing, and thought that he was\nrather a good hand at the work. \"I will then endeavour to explain to\nyou the reasons which make me think that it will be better for us\nboth that our engagement should be at an end. If, after reading it,\nyou shall disagree with me, and still insist on the right which I\ngave you when I asked you to become my wife,--I will then perform the\npromise which I certainly made.\" To this most foolish proposal on his\npart, Lizzie, of course, acquiesced. She acquiesced, and bade him\nfarewell with her sweetest smile. It was now manifest to her that she\ncould have her husband,--or her revenge, just as she might prefer.\n\nThis had been a day of triumph to her, and she was talking of it in\nthe evening triumphantly to Mrs. Carbuncle, when she was told that a\npoliceman wanted to see her down-stairs! Oh, those wretched police!\nAgain all the blood rushed to her head and nearly killed her. She\ndescended slowly; and was then informed by a man, not dressed,\nlike Bunfit, in plain clothes, but with all the paraphernalia of a\npoliceman's uniform, that her late servant, Patience Crabstick, had\ngiven herself up as Queen's evidence, and was now in custody in\nScotland Yard. It had been thought right that she should be so far\ninformed; but the man was able to tell her nothing further.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXII\n\n\"You Know Where My Heart Is\"\n\n\nOn the Sunday following, Frank, as usual, was in Hertford Street. He\nhad become almost a favourite with Mrs. Carbuncle; and had so far\ningratiated himself even with Lucinda Roanoke that, according to\nLizzie's report, he might, if so inclined, rob Sir Griffin of his\nprize without much difficulty. On this occasion he was unhappy and in\nlow spirits; and when questioned on the subject made no secret of the\nfact that he was harassed for money. \"The truth is I have overdrawn\nmy bankers by five hundred pounds, and they have, as they say,\nventured to remind me of it. I wish they were not venturesome quite\nso often; for they reminded me of the same fact about a fortnight\nago.\"\n\n\"What do you do with your money, Mr. Greystock?\" asked Mrs.\nCarbuncle, laughing.\n\n\"Muddle it away, paying my bills with it,--according to the very,\nvery old story. The fact is, I live in that detestable no-man's land,\nbetween respectability and insolvency, which has none of the pleasure\nof either. I am fair game for every creditor, as I am supposed to pay\nmy way,--and yet I never can pay my way.\"\n\n\"Just like my poor dear father,\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"Not exactly, Lizzie. He managed much better, and never paid anybody.\nIf I could only land on terra-firma,--one side or the other,--I\nshouldn't much care which. As it is I have all the recklessness, but\nnone of the carelessness, of the hopelessly insolvent man. And it is\nso hard with us. Attorneys owe us large sums of money, and we can't\ndun them very well. I have a lot of money due to me from rich men,\nwho don't pay me simply because they don't think that it matters.\nI talk to them grandly, and look big, as though money was the last\nthing I thought of, when I am longing to touch my hat and ask them as\na great favour to settle my little bill.\" All this time Lizzie was\nfull of matter which she must impart to her cousin, and could impart\nto him only in privacy.\n\nIt was absolutely necessary that she should tell him what she had\nheard of Patience Crabstick. In her heart of hearts she wished that\nPatience Crabstick had gone off safely with her plunder to the\nAntipodes. She had no wish to get back what had been lost, either in\nthe matter of the diamonds or of the smaller things taken. She had\nsincerely wished that the police might fail in all their endeavours,\nand that the thieves might enjoy perfect security with their booty.\nShe did not even begrudge Mr. Benjamin the diamonds,--or Lord George,\nif in truth Lord George had been the last thief. The robbery had\nenabled her to get the better of Mr. Camperdown, and apparently of\nLord Fawn; and had freed her from the custody of property which she\nhad learned to hate. It had been a very good robbery. But now these\nwretched police had found Patience Crabstick, and would disturb her\nagain!\n\nOf course she must tell her cousin. He must hear the news, and it\nwould be better that he should hear it from her than from others.\nThis was Sunday, and she thought he would be sure to know the truth\non the following Monday. In this she was right; for on the Monday old\nLady Linlithgow saw it stated in the newspapers that an arrest had\nbeen made. \"I have something to tell you,\" she said, as soon as she\nhad succeeded in finding herself alone with him.\n\n\"Anything about the diamonds?\"\n\n\"Well, no; not exactly about the diamonds;--though perhaps it is. But\nfirst, Frank, I want to say something else to you.\"\n\n\"Not about the diamonds?\"\n\n\"Oh no;--not at all. It is this. You must let me lend you that five\nhundred pounds you want.\"\n\n\"Indeed you shall do no such thing. I should not have mentioned it to\nyou if I had not thought that you were one of the insolvent yourself.\nYou were in debt yourself when we last talked about money.\"\n\n\"So I am;--and that horrid woman, Mrs. Carbuncle, has made me lend\nher one hundred and fifty pounds. But it is so different with you,\nFrank.\"\n\n\"Yes;--my needs are greater than hers.\"\n\n\"What is she to me?--while you are everything! Things can't be so bad\nwith me but what I can raise five hundred pounds. After all, I am not\nreally in debt, for a person with my income; but if I were, still my\nfirst duty would be to help you if you want help.\"\n\n\"Be generous first, and just afterwards. That's it;--isn't it,\nLizzie? But indeed, under no circumstances could I take a penny of\nyour money. There are some persons from whom a man can borrow, and\nsome from whom he cannot. You are clearly one of those from whom I\ncannot borrow.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Ah,--one can't explain these things. It simply is so. Mrs. Carbuncle\nwas quite the natural person to borrow your money, and it seems that\nshe has complied with nature. Some Jew who wants thirty per cent. is\nthe natural person for me. All these things are arranged, and it is\nof no use disturbing the arrangements and getting out of course. I\nshall pull through. And now let me know your own news.\"\n\n\"The police have taken Patience.\"\n\n\"They have,--have they? Then at last we shall know all about the\ndiamonds.\" This was gall to poor Lizzie. \"Where did they get her?\"\n\n\"Ah!--I don't know that.\"\n\n\"And who told you?\"\n\n\"A policeman came here last night and said so. She is going to\nturn against the thieves, and tell all that she knows. Nasty, mean\ncreature.\"\n\n\"Thieves are nasty, mean creatures generally. We shall get it all\nout now,--as to what happened at Carlisle and what happened here. Do\nyou know that everybody believes, up to this moment, that your dear\nfriend Lord George de Bruce sold the diamonds to Mr. Benjamin, the\njeweller?\"\n\nLizzie could only shrug her shoulders. She herself, among many\ndoubts, was upon the whole disposed to think as everybody thought.\nShe did believe,--as far as she believed anything in the matter, that\nthe Corsair had determined to become possessed of the prize from the\nmoment that he saw it in Scotland, that the Corsair arranged the\nrobbery in Carlisle, and that again he arranged the robbery in the\nLondon house as soon as he learned from Lizzie where the diamonds\nwere placed. To her mind this had been the most ready solution of the\nmystery, and when she found that other people almost regarded him as\nthe thief, her doubts became a belief. And she did not in the least\ndespise or dislike him or condemn him for what he had done. Were he\nto come to her and confess it all, telling his story in such a manner\nas to make her seem to be safe for the future, she would congratulate\nhim and accept him at once as her own dear, expected Corsair. But, if\nso, he should not have bungled the thing. He should have managed his\nsubordinates better than to have one of them turn evidence against\nhim. He should have been able to get rid of a poor weak female like\nPatience Crabstick. Why had he not sent her to New York, or--or--or\nanywhere? If Lizzie were to hear that Lord George had taken Patience\nout to sea in a yacht,--somewhere among the bright islands of which\nshe thought so much,--and dropped the girl overboard, tied up in a\nbag, she would regard it as a proper Corsair arrangement. Now she was\nangry with Lord George because her trouble was coming back upon her.\nFrank had suggested that Lord George was the robber in chief, and\nLizzie merely shrugged her shoulders. \"We shall know all about it\nnow,\" said he triumphantly.\n\n\"I don't know that I want to know any more about it. I have been so\ntortured about these wretched diamonds, that I never wish to hear\nthem mentioned again. I don't care who has got them. My enemies used\nto think that I loved them so well that I could not bear to part with\nthem. I hated them always, and never took any pleasure in them. I\nused to think that I would throw them into the sea; and when they\nwere gone I was glad of it.\"\n\n\"Thieves ought to be discovered, Lizzie,--for the good of the\ncommunity.\"\n\n\"I don't care for the community. What has the community ever done for\nme? And now I have something else to tell you. Ever so many people\ncame yesterday as well as that wretched policeman. Dear Lady Glencora\nwas here again.\"\n\n\"They'll make a Radical of you among them, Lizzie.\"\n\n\"I don't care a bit about that. I'd just as soon be a Radical as a\nstupid old Conservative. Lady Glencora has been most kind, and she\nbrought me the dearest message from the Duke of Omnium. The duke had\nheard how ill I had been treated.\"\n\n\"The duke is doting.\"\n\n\"It is so easy to say that when a man is old. I don't think you know\nhim, Frank.\"\n\n\"Not in the least;--nor do I wish.\"\n\n\"It is something to have the sympathy of men high placed in the\nworld. And as to Lady Glencora, I do love her dearly. She just comes\nup to my beau-ideal of what a woman should be,--disinterested, full\nof spirit, affectionate, with a dash of romance about her.\"\n\n\"A great dash of romance, I fancy.\"\n\n\"And a determination to be something in the world. Lady Glencora\nPalliser is something.\"\n\n\"She is awfully rich, Lizzie.\"\n\n\"I suppose so. At any rate, that is no disgrace. And then, Frank,\nsomebody else came.\"\n\n\"Lord Fawn was to have come.\"\n\n\"He did come.\"\n\n\"And how did it go between you?\"\n\n\"Ah,--that will be so difficult to explain. I wish you had been\nbehind the curtain to hear it all. It is so necessary that you should\nknow, and yet it is so hard to tell. I spoke up to him, and was quite\nhigh-spirited.\"\n\n\"I daresay you were.\"\n\n\"I told him out, bravely, of all the wrong he had done me. I did not\nsit and whimper, I can assure you. Then he talked about you,--of your\nattentions.\"\n\nFrank Greystock, of course, remembered the scene among the rocks, and\nMr. Gowran's wagging head and watchful eyes. At the time he had felt\ncertain that some use would be made of Andy's vigilance, though he\nhad not traced the connexion between the man and Mrs. Hittaway. If\nLord Fawn had heard of the little scene, there might, doubtless, be\ncause for him to talk of \"attentions.\" \"What did it matter to him?\"\nasked Frank. \"He is an insolent ass,--as I have told him once, and\nshall have to tell him again.\"\n\n\"I think it did matter, Frank.\"\n\n\"I don't see it a bit. He had resigned his rights,--whatever they\nwere.\"\n\n\"But I had not accepted his resignation,--as they say in the\nnewspapers;--nor have I now.\"\n\n\"You would still marry him?\"\n\n\"I don't say that, Frank. This is an important business, and let us\ngo through it steadily. I would certainly like to have him again at\nmy feet. Whether I would deign to lift him up again is another thing.\nIs not that natural, after what he has done to me?\"\n\n\"Woman's nature.\"\n\n\"And I am a woman. Yes, Frank. I would have him again at my\ndisposal,--and he is so. He is to write me a long letter;--so like\na Government-man, isn't it? And he has told me already what he is\nto put into the letter. They always do, you know. He is to say that\nhe'll marry me if I choose.\"\n\n\"He has promised to say that?\"\n\n\"When he said that he would come, I made up my mind that he should\nnot go out of the house till he had promised that. He couldn't get\nout of it. What had I done?\" Frank thought of the scene among the\nrocks. He did not, of course, allude to it, but Lizzie was not so\nreticent. \"As to what that old rogue saw down in Scotland, I don't\ncare a bit about it, Frank. He has been up in London, and telling\nthem all, no doubt. Nasty, dirty eavesdropper! But what does it come\nto? Psha! When he mentioned your name I silenced him at once. What\ncould I have done, unless I had had some friend? At any rate, he is\nto ask me again in writing,--and then what shall I say?\"\n\n\"You must consult your own heart.\"\n\n\"No, Frank;--I need not do that. Why do you say so?\"\n\n\"I know not what else to say.\"\n\n\"A woman can marry without consulting her heart. Women do so every\nday. This man is a lord, and has a position. No doubt I despise him\nthoroughly,--utterly. I don't hate him, because he is not worth being\nhated.\"\n\n\"And yet you would marry him?\"\n\n\"I have not said so. I will tell you this truth, though perhaps you\nwill say it is not feminine. I would fain marry some one. To be as I\nhave been for the last two years is not a happy condition.\"\n\n\"I would not marry a man I despised.\"\n\n\"Nor would I,--willingly. He is honest and respectable; and in spite\nof all that has come and gone would, I think, behave well to a woman\nwhen she was once his wife. Of course, I would prefer to marry a man\nthat I could love. But if that is impossible, Frank--\"\n\n\"I thought that you had determined that you would have nothing to do\nwith this lord.\"\n\n\"I thought so too. Frank, you have known all that I have thought, and\nall that I have wished. You talk to me of marrying where my heart has\nbeen given. Is it possible that I should do so?\"\n\n\"How am I to say?\"\n\n\"Come, Frank, be true with me. I am forcing myself to speak truth to\nyou. I think that between you and me, at any rate, there should be no\nwords spoken that are not true. Frank, you know where my heart is.\"\nAs she said this, she stood over him, and laid her hand upon his\nshoulder. \"Will you answer me one question?\"\n\n\"If I can, I will.\"\n\n\"Are you engaged to marry Lucy Morris?\"\n\n\"I am.\"\n\n\"And you intend to marry her?\" To this question he made no immediate\nanswer. \"We are old enough now, Frank, to know that something more\nthan what you call heart is wanted to make us happy when we marry. I\nwill say nothing hard of Lucy, though she be my rival.\"\n\n\"You can say nothing hard of her. She is perfect.\"\n\n\"We will let that pass, though it is hardly kind of you, just at the\npresent moment. Let her be perfect. Can you marry this perfection\nwithout a sixpence,--you that are in debt, and who never could save a\nsixpence in your life? Would it be for her good,--or for yours? You\nhave done a foolish thing, sir, and you know that you must get out of\nit.\"\n\n\"I know nothing of the kind.\"\n\n\"You cannot marry Lucy Morris. That is the truth. My present need\nmakes me bold. Frank, shall I be your wife? Such a marriage will not\nbe without love, at any rate on one side,--though there be utter\nindifference on the other!\"\n\n\"You know I am not indifferent to you,\" said he, with wicked\nweakness.\n\n\"Now, at any rate,\" she continued, \"you must understand what must\nbe my answer to Lord Fawn. It is you that must answer Lord Fawn. If\nmy heart is to be broken, I may as well break it under his roof as\nanother.\"\n\n\"I have no roof to offer you,\" he said.\n\n\"But I have one for you,\" she said, throwing her arm round his neck.\nHe bore her embrace for a minute, returning it with the pressure of\nhis arm; and then, escaping from it, seized his hat and left her\nstanding in the room.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXIII\n\nThe Corsair Is Afraid\n\n\nOn the following morning,--Monday morning,--there appeared in one\nof the daily newspapers the paragraph of which Lady Linlithgow had\nspoken to Lucy Morris. \"We are given to understand,\"--newspapers are\nvery frequently given to understand,--\"that a man well-known to the\nLondon police as an accomplished housebreaker has been arrested in\nreference to the robbery which was effected on the 30th of January\nlast at Lady Eustace's house in Hertford Street. No doubt the same\nperson was concerned in the robbery of her ladyship's jewels at\nCarlisle on the night of the 8th of January. The mystery which has so\nlong enveloped these two affairs, and which has been so discreditable\nto the metropolitan police, will now probably be cleared up.\" There\nwas not a word about Patience Crabstick in this; and, as Lizzie\nobserved, the news brought by the policeman on Saturday night\nreferred only to Patience, and said nothing of the arrest of any\nburglar. The ladies in Hertford Street scanned the sentence with the\ngreatest care, and Mrs. Carbuncle was very angry because the house\nwas said to be Lizzie's house. \"It wasn't my doing,\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"The policeman came to you about it.\"\n\n\"I didn't say a word to the man,--and I didn't want him to come.\"\n\n\"I hope it will be all found out now,\" said Lucinda.\n\n\"I wish it were all clean forgotten,\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"It ought to be found out,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle. \"But the police\nshould be more careful in what they say. I suppose we shall all have\nto go before the magistrates again.\"\n\nPoor Lizzie felt that fresh trouble was certainly coming upon her.\nShe had learned now that the crime for which she might be prosecuted\nand punished was that of perjury,--that even if everything was known,\nshe could not be accused of stealing, and that if she could only get\nout of the way till the wrath of the magistrate and policemen should\nhave evaporated, she might possibly escape altogether. At any rate,\nthey could not take her income away from her. But how could she get\nout of the way, and how could she endure to be cross-examined, and\nlooked at, and inquired into, by all those who would be concerned in\nthe matter? She thought that, if only she could have arranged her\nmatrimonial affairs before the bad day came upon her, she could have\nendured it better. If she might be allowed to see Lord George, she\ncould ask for advice,--could ask for advice, not as she was always\nforced to do from her cousin, on a false statement of facts, but with\neverything known and declared.\n\nOn that very day Lord George came to Hertford Street. He had been\nthere more than once, perhaps half a dozen times, since the robbery;\nbut on all these occasions Lizzie had been in bed, and he had\ndeclined to visit her in her chamber. In fact, even Lord George had\nbecome somewhat afraid of her since he had been told the true story\nas to the necklace at Carlisle. That story he had heard from herself,\nand he had also heard from Mr. Benjamin some other little details as\nto her former life. Mr. Benjamin, whose very close attention had been\ndrawn to the Eustace diamonds, had told Lord George how he had valued\nthem at her ladyship's request, and had caused an iron case to be\nmade for them, and how her ladyship had, on one occasion, endeavoured\nto sell the necklace to him. Mr. Benjamin, who certainly was intimate\nwith Lord George, was very fond of talking about the diamonds, and\nhad once suggested to his lordship that, were they to become his\nlordship's by marriage, he, Benjamin, might be willing to treat with\nhis lordship. In regard to treating with her ladyship,--Mr. Benjamin\nacknowledged that he thought it would be too hazardous. Then came the\nrobbery of the box, and Lord George was all astray. Mr. Benjamin was\nfor a while equally astray, but neither friend believed in the other\nfriend's innocence. That Lord George should suspect Mr. Benjamin was\nquite natural. Mr. Benjamin hardly knew what to think;--hardly gave\nLord George credit for the necessary courage, skill, and energy. But\nat last, as he began to put two and two together, he divined the\ntruth, and was enabled to set the docile Patience on the watch over\nher mistress's belongings. So it had been with Mr. Benjamin, who at\nlast was able to satisfy Mr. Smiler and Mr. Cann that he had been no\nparty to their cruel disappointment at Carlisle. How Lord George had\nlearned the truth has been told;--the truth as to Lizzie's hiding the\nnecklace under her pillow and bringing it up to London in her desk.\nBut of the facts of the second robbery he knew nothing up to this\nmorning. He almost suspected that Lizzie had herself again been at\nwork,--and he was afraid of her. He had promised her that he would\ntake care of her,--had, perhaps, said enough to make her believe\nthat some day he would marry her. He hardly remembered what he had\nsaid;--but he was afraid of her. She was so wonderfully clever that,\nif he did not take care, she would get him into some mess from which\nhe would be unable to extricate himself.\n\nHe had never whispered her secret to any one; and had still been at a\nloss about the second robbery, when he too saw the paragraph in the\nnewspaper. He went direct to Scotland Yard and made inquiry there.\nHis name had been so often used in the affair, that such inquiry from\nhim was justified. \"Well, my lord; yes; we have found out something,\"\nsaid Bunfit. \"Mr. Benjamin is off, you know.\"\n\n\"Benjamin off?\"\n\n\"Cut the painter, my lord, and started. But what's the good, now we\nhas the wires?\"\n\n\"And who were the thieves?\"\n\n\"Ah, my lord, that's telling. Perhaps I don't know. Perhaps I do.\nPerhaps two or three of us knows. You'll hear all in good time, my\nlord.\" Mr. Bunfit wished to appear communicative because he knew\nbut little himself. Gager, in the meanest possible manner, had kept\nthe matter very close; but the fact that Mr. Benjamin had started\nsuddenly on foreign travel had become known to Mr. Bunfit.\n\nLord George had been very careful, asking no question about the\nnecklace;--no question which would have shown that he knew that the\nnecklace had been in Hertford Street when the robbery took place\nthere; but it seemed to him now that the police must be aware that it\nwas so. The arrest had been made because of the robbery in Hertford\nStreet, and because of that arrest Mr. Benjamin had taken his\ndeparture. Mr. Benjamin was too big a man to have concerned himself\ndeeply in the smaller matters which had then been stolen.\n\nFrom Scotland Yard Lord George went direct to Hertford Street. He\nwas in want of money, in want of a settled home, in want of a future\nincome, and altogether unsatisfied with his present mode of life.\nLizzie Eustace, no doubt, would take him,--unless she had told her\nsecret to some other lover. To have his wife, immediately on her\nmarriage, or even before it, arraigned for perjury, would not be\npleasant. There was very much in the whole affair of which he would\nnot be proud as he led his bride to the altar;--but a man does not\nexpect to get four thousand pounds a year for nothing. Lord George,\nat any rate, did not conceive himself to be in a position to do so.\nHad there not been something crooked about Lizzie,--a screw loose, as\npeople say,--she would never have been within his reach. There are\nmen who always ride lame horses, and yet see as much of the hunting\nas others. Lord George, when he had begun to think that, after the\ntale which he had forced her to tell him, she had caused the diamonds\nto be stolen by her own maid out of her own desk, became almost\nafraid of her. But now, as he looked at the matter again and again,\nhe believed that the second robbery had been genuine. He did not\nquite make up his mind, but he went to Hertford Street resolved to\nsee her.\n\nHe asked for her, and was shown at once into her own sitting-room.\n\"So you have come at last,\" she said.\n\n\"Yes;--I've come at last. It would not have done for me to come up to\nyou when you were in bed. Those women down-stairs would have talked\nabout it everywhere.\"\n\n\"I suppose they would,\" said Lizzie almost piteously.\n\n\"It wouldn't have been at all wise after all that has been said.\nPeople would have been sure to suspect that I had got the things out\nof your desk.\"\n\n\"Oh, no;--not that.\"\n\n\"I wasn't going to run the risk, my dear.\" His manner to her was\nanything but civil, anything but complimentary. If this was his\nCorsair humour, she was not sure that a Corsair might be agreeable to\nher. \"And now tell me what you know about this second robbery.\"\n\n\"I know nothing, Lord George.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, you do. You know something. You know, at any rate, that the\ndiamonds were there.\"\n\n\"Yes;--I know that.\"\n\n\"And that they were taken?\"\n\n\"Of course they were taken.\"\n\n\"You are sure of that?\" There was something in his manner absolutely\ninsolent to her. Frank was affectionate, and even Lord Fawn treated\nher with deference. \"Because, you know, you have been very clever.\nTo tell you the truth, I did not think at first that they had been\nreally stolen. It might, you know, have been a little game to get\nthem out of your own hands,--between you and your maid.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you take me for, Lord George.\"\n\n\"I take you for a lady who, for a long time, got the better of the\npolice and the magistrates, and who managed to shift all the trouble\noff your own shoulders on to those of other people. You have heard\nthat they have taken one of the thieves?\"\n\n\"And they have got the girl.\"\n\n\"Have they? I didn't know that. That scoundrel Benjamin has levanted\ntoo.\"\n\n\"Levanted!\" said Lizzie, raising both her hands.\n\n\"Not an hour too soon, my lady. And now what do you mean to do?\"\n\n\"What ought I to do?\"\n\n\"Of course the whole truth will come out.\"\n\n\"Must it come out?\"\n\n\"Not a doubt of that. How can it be helped?\"\n\n\"You won't tell. You promised that you would not.\"\n\n\"Psha;--promised! If they put me in a witness-box of course I must\ntell. When you come to this kind of work, promises don't go for much.\nI don't know that they ever do. What is a broken promise?\"\n\n\"It's a story,\" said Lizzie, in innocent amazement.\n\n\"And what was it you told when you were upon your oath at Carlisle;\nand again when the magistrate came here?\"\n\n\"Oh, Lord George;--how unkind you are to me!\"\n\n\"Patience Crabstick will tell it all, without any help from me. Don't\nyou see that the whole thing must be known? She'll say where the\ndiamonds were found;--and how did they come there, if you didn't put\nthem there? As for telling, there'll be telling enough. You've only\ntwo things to do.\"\n\n\"What are they, Lord George?\"\n\n\"Go off, like Mr. Benjamin; or else make a clean breast of it. Send\nfor John Eustace and tell him the whole. For his brother's sake he'll\nmake the best of it. It will all be published, and then, perhaps,\nthere will be an end of it.\"\n\n\"I couldn't do that, Lord George!\" said Lizzie, bursting into tears.\n\n\"You ask me, and I can only tell you what I think. That you should\nbe able to keep the history of the diamonds a secret, does not seem\nto me to be upon the cards. No doubt people who are rich, and are\nconnected with rich people, and have great friends,--who are what the\nworld call swells,--have great advantages over their inferiors when\nthey get into trouble. You are the widow of a baronet, and you have\nan uncle a bishop, and another a dean, and a countess for an aunt.\nYou have a brother-in-law and a first-cousin in Parliament, and your\nfather was an admiral. The other day you were engaged to marry a\npeer.\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" said Lizzie, \"and Lady Glencora Palliser is my particular\nfriend.\"\n\n\"She is; is she? So much the better. Lady Glencora, no doubt, is a\nvery swell among swells.\"\n\n\"The Duke of Omnium would do anything for me,\" said Lizzie with\nenthusiasm.\n\n\"If you were nobody, you would, of course, be indicted for perjury,\nand would go to prison. As it is, if you will tell all your story\nto one of your swell friends, I think it very likely that you may\nbe pulled through. I should say that Mr. Eustace, or your cousin\nGreystock, would be the best.\"\n\n\"Why couldn't you do it? You know it all. I told you\nbecause--because--because I thought you would be the kindest to me.\"\n\n\"You told me, my dear, because you thought it would not matter much\nwith me, and I appreciate the compliment. I can do nothing for you. I\nam not near enough to those who wear wigs.\"\n\nLizzie did not above half understand him,--did not at all understand\nhim when he spoke of those who wore wigs, and was quite dark to his\nirony about her great friends;--but she did perceive that he was in\nearnest in recommending her to confess. She thought about it for a\nmoment in silence, and the more she thought the more she felt that\nshe could not do it. Had he not suggested a second alternative,--that\nshe should go off like Mr. Benjamin? It might be possible that she\nshould go off, and yet be not quite like Mr. Benjamin. In that case\nought she not to go under the protection of her Corsair? Would not\nthat be the proper way of going? \"Might I not go abroad,--just for a\ntime?\" she asked.\n\n\"And so let it blow over?\"\n\n\"Just so, you know.\"\n\n\"It is possible that you might,\" he said. \"Not that it would blow\nover altogether. Everybody would know it. It is too late now to\nstop the police, and if you meant to be off, you should be off at\nonce;--to-day or to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Oh dear!\"\n\n\"Indeed, there's no saying whether they will let you go. You could\nstart now, this moment;--and if you were at Dover could get over to\nFrance. But when once it is known that you had the necklace all that\ntime in your own desk, any magistrate, I imagine, could stop you.\nYou'd better have some lawyer you can trust;--not that blackguard\nMopus.\"\n\nLord George had certainly brought her no comfort. When he told her\nthat she might go at once if she chose, she remembered, with a pang\nof agony, that she had already overdrawn her account at the bankers.\nShe was the actual possessor of an income of four thousand pounds a\nyear, and now, in her terrible strait, she could not stir because she\nhad no money with which to travel. Had all things been well with her,\nshe could, no doubt, have gone to her bankers and have arranged this\nlittle difficulty. But as it was, she could not move, because her\npurse was empty.\n\nLord George sat looking at her, and thinking whether he would make\nthe plunge and ask her to be his wife,--with all her impediments and\ndrawbacks about her. He had been careful to reduce her to such a\ncondition of despair, that she would undoubtedly have accepted him,\nso that she might have some one to lean upon in her trouble;--but,\nas he looked at her, he doubted. She was such a mass of deceit, that\nhe was afraid of her. She might say that she would marry him, and\nthen, when the storm was over, refuse to keep her word. She might\nbe in debt,--almost to any amount. She might be already married,\nfor anything that he knew. He did know that she was subject to all\nmanner of penalties for what she had done. He looked at her, and told\nhimself that she was very pretty. But in spite of her beauty, his\njudgment went against her. He did not dare to share even his boat\nwith so dangerous a fellow-passenger. \"That's my advice,\" he said,\ngetting up from his chair.\n\n\"Are you going?\"\n\n\"Well;--yes; I don't know what else I can do for you.\"\n\n\"You are so unkind!\" He shrugged his shoulders, just touched her\nhand, and left the room without saying another word to her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXIV\n\nLizzie's Last Scheme\n\n\nLizzie, when she was left alone, was very angry with the Corsair,--in\ntruth, more sincerely angry than she had ever been with any of her\nlovers, or, perhaps, with any human being. Sincere, true, burning\nwrath was not the fault to which she was most exposed. She could snap\nand snarl, and hate, and say severe things; she could quarrel, and\nfight, and be malicious;--but to be full of real wrath was uncommon\nwith her. Now she was angry. She had been civil, more than civil,\nto Lord George. She had opened her house to him, and her heart. She\nhad told him her great secret. She had implored his protection.\nShe had thrown herself into his arms. And now he had rejected her.\nThat he should have been rough to her was only in accordance with\nthe poetical attributes which she had attributed to him. But his\nroughness should have been streaked with tenderness. He should not\nhave left her roughly. In the whole interview he had not said a\nloving word to her. He had given her advice,--which might be good or\nbad,--but he had given it as to one whom he despised. He had spoken\nto her throughout the interview exactly as he might have spoken to\nSir Griffin Tewett. She could not analyse her feelings thoroughly,\nbut she felt that because of what had passed between them, by reason\nof his knowledge of her secret, he had robbed her of all that\nobservance which was due to her as a woman and a lady. She had been\nroughly used before,--by people of inferior rank who had seen through\nher ways. Andrew Gowran had insulted her. Patience Crabstick had\nargued with her. Benjamin, the employer of thieves, had been familiar\nwith her. But hitherto, in what she was pleased to call her own set,\nshe had always been treated with that courtesy which ladies seldom\nfail to receive. She understood it all. She knew how much of mere\nword-service there often is in such complimentary usage. But,\nnevertheless, it implies respect, and an acknowledgement of the\nposition of her who is so respected. Lord George had treated her as\none schoolboy treats another.\n\nAnd he had not spoken to her one word of love. Love will excuse\nroughness. Spoken love will palliate even spoken roughness. Had he\nonce called her his own Lizzie, he might have scolded her as he\npleased,--might have abused her to the top of his bent. But as there\nhad been nothing of the manner of a gentleman to a lady, so also had\nthere been nothing of the lover to his mistress. That dream was over.\nLord George was no longer a Corsair, but a brute.\n\nBut what should she do? Even a brute may speak truth. She was to have\ngone to a theatre that evening with Mrs. Carbuncle, but she stayed\nat home thinking over her position. She heard nothing throughout the\nday from the police; and she made up her mind that, unless she were\nstopped by the police, she would go to Scotland on the day but one\nfollowing. She thought that she was sure that she would do so; but,\nof course, she must be guided by events as they occurred. She wrote,\nhowever, to Miss Macnulty saying that she would come, and she told\nMrs. Carbuncle of her proposed journey as that lady was leaving the\nhouse for the theatre. On the following morning, however, news came\nwhich again made her journey doubtful. There was another paragraph\nin the newspaper about the robbery, acknowledging the former\nparagraph to have been in some respect erroneous. The \"accomplished\nhousebreaker\" had not been arrested. A confederate of the\n\"accomplished housebreaker\" was in the hands of the police, and the\npolice were on the track of the \"accomplished housebreaker\" himself.\nThen there was a line or two alluding in a very mysterious way to the\ndisappearance of a certain jeweller. Taking it altogether, Lizzie\nthought that there was ground for hope,--and that, at any rate, there\nwould be delay. She would, perhaps, put off going to Scotland for\nyet a day or two. Was it not necessary that she should wait for Lord\nFawn's answer; and would it not be incumbent on her cousin Frank to\nsend her some account of himself after the abrupt manner in which he\nhad left her?\n\nIf in real truth she should be driven to tell her story to any\none,--and she began to think that she was so driven,--she would tell\nit to him. She believed more in his regard for her than that of any\nother human being. She thought that he would, in truth, have been\ndevoted to her, had he not become entangled with that wretched little\ngoverness. And she thought that if he could see his way out of that\nscrape, he would marry her even yet,--would marry her, and be good\nto her, so that her dream of a poetical phase of life should not\nbe altogether dissolved. After all, the diamonds were her own. She\nhad not stolen them. When perplexed in the extreme by magistrates\nand policemen, with nobody near her whom she trusted to give her\nadvice,--for Lizzie now of course declared to herself that she had\nnever for a moment trusted the Corsair,--she had fallen into an\nerror, and said what was not true. As she practised it before the\nglass, she thought that she could tell her story in a becoming\nmanner, with becoming tears, to Frank Greystock. And were it not for\nLucy Morris, she thought that he would take her with all her faults\nand all her burthens.\n\nAs for Lord Fawn, she knew well enough that, let him write what he\nwould, and renew his engagement in what most formal manner might be\npossible, he would be off again when he learned the facts as to that\nnight at Carlisle. She had brought him to succumb, because he could\nno longer justify his treatment of her by reference to the diamonds.\nBut when once all the world should know that she had twice perjured\nherself, his justification would be complete,--and his escape\nwould be certain. She would use his letter simply to achieve that\nrevenge which she had promised herself. Her effort,--her last final\neffort,--must be made to secure the hand and heart of her cousin\nFrank. \"Ah, 'tis his heart I want!\" she said to herself.\n\nShe must settle something before she went to Scotland,--if there was\nanything that could be settled. If she could only get a promise from\nFrank before all her treachery had been exposed, he probably would\nremain true to his promise. He would not desert her as Lord Fawn had\ndone. Then, after much thinking of it, she resolved upon a scheme\nwhich, of all her schemes, was the wickedest. Whatever it might cost\nher, she would create a separation between Frank Greystock and Lucy\nMorris. Having determined upon this, she wrote to Lucy, asking her to\ncall in Hertford Street at a certain hour.\n\n\n   DEAR LUCY,\n\n   I particularly want to see you,--on business. Pray come to\n   me at twelve to-morrow. I will send the carriage for you,\n   and it will take you back again. Pray do this. We used to\n   love one another, and I am sure I love you still.\n\n   Your affectionate old friend,\n\n   LIZZIE.\n\n\nAs a matter of course Lucy went to her. Lizzie, before the interview,\nstudied the part she was to play with all possible care,--even to the\nwords which she was to use. The greeting was at first kindly, for\nLucy had almost forgotten the bribe that had been offered to her, and\nhad quite forgiven it. Lizzie Eustace never could be dear to her;\nbut,--so Lucy had thought during her happiness,--this former friend\nof hers was the cousin of the man who was to be her husband, and was\ndear to him. Of course she had forgiven the offence. \"And now, dear,\nI want to ask you a question,\" Lizzie said; \"or rather, perhaps not a\nquestion. I can do it better than that. I think that my cousin Frank\nonce talked of--of making you his wife.\" Lucy answered not a word,\nbut she trembled in every limb, and the colour came to her face. \"Was\nit not so, dear?\"\n\n\"What if it was? I don't know why you should ask me any question like\nthat about myself.\"\n\n\"Is he not my cousin?\"\n\n\"Yes,--he is your cousin. Why don't you ask him? You see him every\nday, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Nearly every day.\"\n\n\"Why do you send for me, then?\"\n\n\"It is so hard to tell you, Lucy. I have sent to you in good faith,\nand in love. I could have gone to you,--only for the old vulture, who\nwould not have let us had a word in peace. I do see him--constantly.\nAnd I love him dearly.\"\n\n\"That is nothing to me,\" said Lucy. Anybody hearing them, and not\nknowing them, would have said that Lucy's manner was harsh in the\nextreme.\n\n\"He has told me everything.\" Lizzie, when she said this, paused,\nlooking at her victim. \"He has told me things which he could\nnot mention to you. It was only yesterday,--the day before\nyesterday,--that he was speaking to me of his debts. I offered to\nplace all that I have at his disposal, so as to free him, but he\nwould not take my money.\"\n\n\"Of course he would not.\"\n\n\"Not my money alone. Then he told me that he was engaged to you. He\nhad never told me before, but yet I knew it. It all came out then.\nLucy, though he is engaged to you, it is me that he loves.\"\n\n\"I don't believe it,\" said Lucy.\n\n\"You can't make me angry, Lucy, because my heart bleeds for you.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! trash! I don't want your heart to bleed. I don't believe\nyou've got a heart. You've got money; I know that.\"\n\n\"And he has got none. If I did not love him, why should I wish to\ngive him all that I have? Is not that disinterested?\"\n\n\"No. You are always thinking of yourself. You couldn't be\ndisinterested.\"\n\n\"And of whom are you thinking? Are you doing the best for him,--a man\nin his position, without money, ambitious, sure to succeed if want\nof money does not stop him,--in wishing him to marry a girl with\nnothing? Cannot I do more for him than you can?\"\n\n\"I could work for him on my knees, I love him so truly!\"\n\n\"Would that do him any service? He cannot marry you. Does he ever see\nyou? Does he write to you as though you were to be his wife? Do you\nnot know that it is all over?--that it must be over? It is impossible\nthat he should marry you. But if you will give him back his word, he\nshall be my husband, and shall have all that I possess. Now, let us\nsee who loves him best!\"\n\n\"I do!\" said Lucy.\n\n\"How will you show it?\"\n\n\"There is no need that I should show it. He knows it. The only one\nin the world to whom I wish it to be known, knows it already well\nenough. Did you send for me for this?\"\n\n\"Yes;--for this.\"\n\n\"It is for him to tell me the tidings;--not for you. You are nothing\nto me;--nothing. And what you say to me now is all for yourself,--not\nfor him. But it is true that he does not see me. It is true that he\ndoes not write to me. You may tell him from me,--for I cannot write\nto him myself,--that he may do whatever is best for him. But if you\ntell him that I do not love him better than all the world, you will\nlie to him. And if you say that he loves you better than he does me,\nthat also will be a lie. I know his heart.\"\n\n\"But Lucy--\"\n\n\"I will hear no more. He can do as he pleases. If money be more to\nhim than love and honesty, let him marry you. I shall never trouble\nhim; he may be sure of that. As for you, Lizzie, I hope that we may\nnever meet again.\"\n\nShe would not get into the Eustace-Carbuncle carriage, which was\nwaiting for her at the door, but walked back to Bruton Street. She\ndid not doubt but that it was all over with her now. That Lizzie\nEustace was an inveterate liar, she knew well; but she did believe\nthat the liar had on this occasion been speaking truth. Lady Fawn was\nnot a liar, and Lady Fawn had told her the same. And, had she wanted\nmore evidence, did not her lover's conduct give it? \"It is because I\nam poor,\" she said to herself,--\"for I know well that he loves me!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXV\n\nTribute\n\n\nLizzie put off her journey to Scotland from day to day, though her\ncousin Frank continually urged upon her the expediency of going.\nThere were various reasons, he said, why she should go. Her child\nwas there, and it was proper that she should be with her child. She\nwas living at present with people whose reputation did not stand\nhigh,--and as to whom all manner of evil reports were flying about\nthe town. It was generally thought,--so said Frank,--that that Lord\nGeorge de Bruce Carruthers had assisted Mr. Benjamin in stealing the\ndiamonds, and Frank himself did not hesitate to express his belief\nin the accusation. \"Oh no, that cannot be,\" said Lizzie, trembling.\nBut, though she rejected the supposition, she did not reject it very\nfirmly. \"And then, you know,\" continued Lizzie, \"I never see him. I\nhave actually only set eyes on him once since the second robbery,\nand then just for a minute. Of course, I used to know him,--down\nat Portray,--but now we are strangers.\" Frank went on with his\nobjections. He declared that the manner in which Mrs. Carbuncle\nhad got up the match between Lucinda Roanoke and Sir Griffin was\nshameful,--all the world was declaring that it was shameful,--that\nshe had not a penny, that the girl was an adventurer, and that Sir\nGriffin was an obstinate, pig-headed, ruined idiot. It was expedient\non every account that Lizzie should take herself away from that\n\"lot.\" The answer that Lizzie desired to make was very simple. Let me\ngo as your betrothed bride, and I will start to-morrow,--to Scotland\nor elsewhere, as you may direct. Let that little affair be settled,\nand I shall be quite as willing to get out of London as you can be to\nsend me. But I am in such a peck of troubles that something must be\nsettled. And as it seems that after all the police are still astray\nabout the necklace, perhaps I needn't run away from them for a little\nwhile even yet. She did not say this. She did not even in so many\nwords make the first proposition. But she did endeavour to make Frank\nunderstand that she would obey his dictation if he would earn the\nright to dictate. He either did not or would not understand her, and\nthen she became angry with him,--or pretended to be angry. \"Really,\nFrank,\" she said, \"you are hardly fair to me.\"\n\n\"In what way am I unfair?\"\n\n\"You come here and abuse all my friends, and tell me to go here and\ngo there, just as though I were a child. And--and--and--\"\n\n\"And what, Lizzie?\"\n\n\"You know what I mean. You are one thing one day, and one another. I\nhope Miss Lucy Morris was quite well when you last heard from her.\"\n\n\"You have no right to speak to me of Lucy,--at least, not in\ndisparagement.\"\n\n\"You are treating her very badly;--you know that.\"\n\n\"I am.\"\n\n\"Then why don't you give it up? Why don't you let her have her\nchances,--to do what she can with them? You know very well that you\ncan't marry her. You know that you ought not to have asked her. You\ntalk of Miss Roanoke and Sir Griffin Tewett. There are people quite\nas bad as Sir Griffin,--or Mrs. Carbuncle either. Don't suppose I am\nspeaking for myself. I've given up all that idle fancy long ago. I\nshall never marry a second time myself. I have made up my mind to\nthat. I have suffered too much already.\" Then she burst into tears.\n\nHe dried her tears and comforted her, and forgave all the injurious\nthings she had said of him. It is almost impossible for a man,--a man\nunder forty and unmarried, and who is not a philosopher,--to have\nfamiliar and affectionate intercourse with a beautiful young woman,\nand carry it on as he might do with a friend of the other sex. In his\nvery heart Greystock despised this woman; he had told himself over\nand over again that were there no Lucy in the case he would not marry\nher; that she was affected, unreal,--and, in fact, a liar in every\nword and look and motion which came from her with premeditation.\nJudging, not from her own account, but from circumstances as he saw\nthem and such evidence as had reached him, he did not condemn her\nin reference to the diamonds. He had never for a moment conceived\nthat she had secreted them. He acquitted her altogether from those\nspecial charges which had been widely circulated against her; but,\nnevertheless, he knew her to be heartless and bad. He had told\nhimself a dozen times that it would be well for him that she should\nbe married and taken out of his hands. And yet he loved her after a\nfashion, and was prone to sit near her, and was fool enough to be\nflattered by her caresses. When she would lay her hand on his arm, a\nthrill of pleasure went through him. And yet he would willingly have\nseen any decent man take her and marry her, making a bargain that\nhe should never see her again. Young or old, men are apt to become\nMerlins when they encounter Viviens. On this occasion he left her,\ndisgusted indeed, but not having told her that he was disgusted.\n\"Come again, Frank, to-morrow, won't you?\" she said. He made her no\npromise as he went, nor had she expected it. He had left her quite\nabruptly the other day, and he now went away almost in the same\nfashion. But she was not surprised. She understood that the task she\nhad in hand was one very difficult to be accomplished,--and she did\nperceive, in some dark way, that, good as her acting was, it was not\nquite good enough. Lucy held her ground because she was real. You\nmay knock about a diamond, and not even scratch it; whereas paste\nin rough usage betrays itself. Lizzie, with all her self-assuring\nprotestations, knew that she was paste, and knew that Lucy was real\nstone. Why could she not force herself to act a little better, so\nthat the paste might be as good as the stone,--might at least seem to\nbe as good? \"If he despises me now, what will he say when he finds it\nall out?\" she asked herself.\n\nAs for Frank Greystock himself, though he had quite made up his mind\nabout Lizzie Eustace, he was still in doubt about the other girl. At\nthe present moment he was making over two thousand pounds a year,\nand yet was more in debt now than he had been a year ago. When he\nattempted to look at his affairs, he could not even remember what\nhad become of his money. He did not gamble. He had no little yacht,\ncosting him about six hundred a year. He kept one horse in London,\nand one only. He had no house. And when he could spare time from his\nwork, he was generally entertained at the houses of his friends. And\nyet from day to day his condition seemed to become worse and worse.\nIt was true that he never thought of half-a-sovereign; that in\ncalling for wine at his club he was never influenced by the cost;\nthat it seemed to him quite rational to keep a cab waiting for him\nhalf the day; that in going or coming he never calculated expense;\nthat in giving an order to a tailor he never dreamed of anything\nbeyond his own comfort. Nevertheless, when he recounted with pride\nhis great economies, reminding himself that he, a successful man,\nwith a large income and no family, kept neither hunters, nor yacht,\nnor moor, and that he did not gamble, he did think it very hard\nthat he should be embarrassed. But he was embarrassed, and in that\ncondition could it be right for him to marry a girl without a\nshilling?\n\nIn these days Mrs. Carbuncle was very urgent with her friend not\nto leave London till after the marriage. Lizzie had given no\npromise,--had only been induced to promise that the loan of one\nhundred and fifty pounds should not be held to have any bearing on\nthe wedding present to be made to Lucinda. That could be got on\ncredit from Messrs. Harter and Benjamin; for though Mr. Benjamin was\nabsent,--on a little tour through Europe in search of precious stones\nin the cheap markets, old Mr. Harter suggested,--the business went\non the same as ever. There was a good deal of consultation about\nthe present, and Mrs. Carbuncle at last decided, no doubt with the\nconcurrence of Miss Roanoke, that it should consist simply of silver\nforks and spoons,--real silver as far as the money would go. Mrs.\nCarbuncle herself went with her friend to select the articles,--as to\nwhich, perhaps, we shall do her no injustice in saying that a ready\nsale, should such a lamentable occurrence ever become necessary,\nwas one of the objects which she had in view. Mrs. Carbuncle's\ninvestigations as to the quality of the metal quite won Mr. Harter's\nrespect; and it will probably be thought that she exacted no\nmore than justice,--seeing that the thing had become a matter\nof bargain,--in demanding that the thirty-five pounds should be\nstretched to fifty, because the things were bought on long credit.\n\"My dear Lizzie,\" Mrs. Carbuncle said, \"the dear girl won't have an\nounce more than she would have got, had you gone into another sort of\nshop with thirty-five sovereigns in your hand.\" Lizzie growled, but\nMrs. Carbuncle's final argument was conclusive. \"I'll tell you what\nwe'll do,\" said she; \"we'll take thirty pounds down in ready money.\"\nThere was no answer to be made to so reasonable a proposition.\n\nThe presents to be made to Lucinda were very much thought of in\nHertford Street at this time, and Lizzie,--independently of any\nfeeling that she might have as to her own contribution,--did all she\ncould to assist the collection of tribute. It was quite understood\nthat as a girl can only be married once,--for a widow's chance in\nsuch matters amounts to but little,--everything should be done to\ngather toll from the tax-payers of society. It was quite fair on such\nan occasion that men should be given to understand that something\nworth having was expected,--no trumpery thirty-shilling piece of\ncrockery, no insignificant glass bottle, or fantastic paper-knife\nof no real value whatever, but got up just to put money into the\ntradesmen's hands. To one or two elderly gentlemen upon whom Mrs.\nCarbuncle had smiled, she ventured to suggest in plain words that a\ncheque was the most convenient cadeau. \"What do you say to a couple\nof sovereigns?\" one sarcastic old gentleman replied, upon whom\nprobably Mrs. Carbuncle had not smiled enough. She laughed and\ncongratulated her sarcastic friend upon his joke;--but the two\nsovereigns were left upon the table, and went to swell the spoil.\n\n\"You must do something handsome for Lucinda,\" Lizzie said to her\ncousin.\n\n\"What do you call handsome?\"\n\n\"You are a bachelor and a Member of Parliament. Say fifteen pounds.\"\n\n\"I'll be ---- if I do!\" said Frank, who was beginning to be very much\ndisgusted with the house in Hertford Street. \"There's a five-pound\nnote, and you may do what you please with it.\" Lizzie gave over the\nfive-pound note,--the identical bit of paper that had come from\nFrank; and Mrs. Carbuncle, no doubt, did do what she pleased with it.\n\nThere was almost a quarrel because Lizzie, after much consideration,\ndeclared that she did not see her way to get a present from the Duke\nof Omnium. She had talked so much to Mrs. Carbuncle about the duke,\nthat Mrs. Carbuncle was almost justified in making the demand. \"It\nisn't the value, you know,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle; \"neither I nor\nLucinda would think of that; but it would look so well to have the\ndear duke's name on something.\" Lizzie declared that the duke was\nunapproachable on such subjects. \"There you're wrong,\" said Mrs.\nCarbuncle. \"I happen to know there is nothing his grace likes so much\nas giving wedding presents.\" This was the harder upon Lizzie as she\nactually did succeed in saying such kind things about Lucinda, that\nLady Glencora sent Miss Roanoke the prettiest smelling-bottle in the\nworld. \"You don't mean to say you've given a present to the future\nLady Tewett?\" said Madame Max Goesler to her friend. \"Why not? Sir\nGriffin can't hurt me. When one begins to be good-natured, why\nshouldn't one be good-natured all round?\" Madame Max remarked that\nit might, perhaps, be preferable to put an end to good-nature\naltogether. \"There I daresay you're right, my dear,\" said Lady\nGlencora. \"I've long felt that making presents means nothing. Only if\none has a lot of money and people like it, why shouldn't one? I've\nmade so many to people I hardly ever saw that one more to Lady Tewett\ncan't hurt.\"\n\nPerhaps the most wonderful affair in that campaign was the spirited\nattack which Mrs. Carbuncle made on a certain Mrs. Hanbury Smith, who\nfor the last six or seven years had not been among Mrs. Carbuncle's\nmore intimate friends. Mrs. Hanbury Smith lived with her husband in\nParis, but before her marriage had known Mrs. Carbuncle in London.\nHer father, Mr. Bunbury Jones, had, from certain causes, chosen to\nshow certain civilities to Mrs. Carbuncle just at the period of his\ndaughter's marriage, and Mrs. Carbuncle being perhaps at that moment\nwell supplied with ready money, had presented a marriage present.\nFrom that to this present day Mrs. Carbuncle had seen nothing of Mrs.\nHanbury Smith, nor of Mr. Bunbury Jones, but she was not the woman to\nwaste the return-value of such a transaction. A present so given was\nseed sown in the earth,--seed, indeed, that could not be expected to\ngive back twenty-fold, or even ten-fold, but still seed from which\na crop should be expected. So she wrote to Mrs. Hanbury Smith,\nexplaining that her darling niece Lucinda was about to be married to\nSir Griffin Tewett, and that, as she had no child of her own, Lucinda\nwas the same to her as a daughter. And then, lest there might be any\nwant of comprehension, she expressed her own assurance that her\nfriend would be glad to have an opportunity of reciprocating the\nfeelings which had been evinced on the occasion of her own marriage.\n\"It is no good mincing matters now-a-days,\" Mrs. Carbuncle would have\nsaid, had any friend pointed out to her that she was taking strong\nmeasures in the exaction of toll. \"People have come to understand\nthat a spade is a spade, and \u00c2\u00a310, \u00c2\u00a310,\" she would have said. Had Mrs.\nHanbury Smith not noticed the application, there might, perhaps, have\nbeen an end of it, but she was silly enough to send over from Paris\na little trumpery bit of finery, bought in the Palais Royal for ten\nfrancs. Whereupon Mrs. Carbuncle wrote the following letter:--\n\n\n   MY DEAR MRS. HANBURY SMITH,\n\n   Lucinda has received your little brooch, and is much\n   obliged to you for thinking of her; but you must remember\n   that when you were married, I sent you a bracelet which\n   cost \u00c2\u00a310. If I had a daughter of my own, I should, of\n   course, expect that she would reap the benefit of this\n   on her marriage;--and my niece is the same to me as a\n   daughter. I think that this is quite understood now among\n   people in society. Lucinda will be disappointed much if\n   you do not send her what she thinks she has a right to\n   expect. Of course you can deduct the brooch if you please.\n\n   Yours very sincerely,\n\n   JANE CARBUNCLE.\n\n\nMr. Hanbury Smith was something of a wag, and caused his wife to\nwrite back as follows:--\n\n\n   DEAR MRS. CARBUNCLE,\n\n   I quite acknowledge the reciprocity system, but don't\n   think it extends to descendants,--certainly not to nieces.\n   I acknowledge, too, the present quoted at \u00c2\u00a310. I thought\n   it had been \u00c2\u00a37 10s.--[\"The nasty, mean creature,\" said\n   Mrs. Carbuncle, when showing the correspondence to\n   Lizzie, \"must have been to the tradesman to inquire! The\n   price named was \u00c2\u00a310, but I got \u00c2\u00a32 l0s. off for ready\n   money.\"]--At your second marriage I will do what is\n   needful; but I can assure you I haven't recognised nieces\n   with any of my friends.\n\n   Yours very truly,\n\n   CAROLINE HANBURY SMITH.\n\n\nThe correspondence was carried no further, for not even can a Mrs.\nCarbuncle exact payment of such a debt in any established court; but\nshe inveighed bitterly against the meanness of Mrs. Smith, telling\nthe story openly, and never feeling that she told it against herself.\nIn her set it was generally thought that she had done quite right.\n\nShe managed better with old Mr. Cabob, who had certainly received\nmany of Mrs. Carbuncle's smiles, and who was very rich. Mr. Cabob did\nas he was desired, and sent a cheque,--a cheque for \u00c2\u00a320; and added\na message that he hoped Miss Roanoke would buy with it any little\nthing that she liked. Miss Roanoke,--or her aunt for her,--liked a\nthirty-guinea ring, and bought it, having the bill for the balance\nsent in to Mr. Cabob. Mr. Cabob, who probably knew that he must pay\nwell for his smiles, never said anything about it.\n\nLady Eustace went into all this work, absolutely liking it. She had\nfelt nothing of anger even as regarded her own contribution,--much as\nshe had struggled to reduce the amount. People, she felt, ought to be\nsharp;--and it was nice to look at pretty things, and to be cunning\nabout them. She would have applied to the Duke of Omnium had she\ndared, and was very triumphant when she got the smelling-bottle from\nLady Glencora. But Lucinda herself took no part whatever in all these\nthings. Nothing that Mrs. Carbuncle could say would induce her to\ntake any interest in them, or even in the trousseau, which, without\nreference to expense, was being supplied chiefly on the very\nindifferent credit of Sir Griffin. What Lucinda had to say about\nthe matter was said solely to her aunt. Neither Lady Eustace, nor\nLord George, nor even the maid who dressed her, heard any of her\ncomplaints. But complain she did, and that with terrible energy.\n\"What is the use of it, Aunt Jane? I shall never have a house to put\nthem into.\"\n\n\"What nonsense, my dear! Why shouldn't you have a house as well as\nothers?\"\n\n\"And if I had, I should never care for them. I hate them. What does\nLady Glencora Palliser or Lord Fawn care for me?\" Even Lord Fawn\nhad been put under requisition, and had sent a little box full of\nstationery.\n\n\"They are worth money, Lucinda; and when a girl marries she always\ngets them.\"\n\n\"Yes;--and when they come from people who love her, and who pour them\ninto her lap with kisses, because she has given herself to a man she\nloves, then it must be nice. Oh,--if I were marrying a poor man, and\na poor friend had given me a gridiron to help me to cook my husband's\ndinner, how I could have valued it!\"\n\n\"I don't know that you like poor things and poor people better than\nanybody else,\" said Aunt Jane.\n\n\"I don't like anything or anybody,\" said Lucinda.\n\n\"You had better take the good things that come to you, then; and not\ngrumble. How I have worked to get all this arranged for you, and now\nwhat thanks have I?\"\n\n\"You'll find you have worked for very little, Aunt Jane. I shall\nnever marry the man yet.\" This, however, had been said so often that\nAunt Jane thought nothing of the threat.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXVI\n\nThe Aspirations of Mr. Emilius\n\n\nIt was acknowledged by Mrs. Carbuncle very freely that in the matter\nof tribute no one behaved better than Mr. Emilius, the fashionable,\nforeign, ci-devant Jew preacher, who still drew great congregations\nin the neighbourhood of Mrs. Carbuncle's house. Mrs. Carbuncle, no\ndoubt, attended regularly at Mr. Emilius's church, and had taken\na sitting for thirteen Sundays at something like ten shillings a\nSunday. But she had not as yet paid the money, and Mr. Emilius was\nwell aware that if his tickets were not paid for in advance, there\nwould be considerable defalcations in his income. He was, as a rule,\nvery particular as to such payments, and would not allow a name to\nbe put on a sitting till the money had reached his pockets; but with\nMrs. Carbuncle he had descended to no such commercial accuracy. Mrs.\nCarbuncle had seats for three,--for one of which Lady Eustace paid\nher share in advance,--in the midst of the very best pews in the most\nconspicuous part of the house,--and hardly a word had been said to\nher about the money. And now there came to them from Mr. Emilius\nthe prettiest little gold salver that ever was seen. \"I send Messrs.\nClerico's docket,\" wrote Mr. Emilius, \"as Miss Roanoke may like to\nknow the quality of the metal.\" \"Ah,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle, inspecting\nthe little dish, and putting two and two together; \"he's got it\ncheap, no doubt,--at the place where they commissioned him to buy\nthe plate and candlesticks for the church; but at \u00c2\u00a33 16s. 3d. the\ngold is worth nearly twenty pounds.\" Mr. Emilius no doubt had had his\nouting in the autumn through the instrumentality of Mrs. Carbuncle's\nkindness; but that was past and gone, and such lavish gratitude for\na past favour could hardly be expected from Mr. Emilius. \"I'll be\nhanged if he isn't after Portray Castle,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle to\nherself.\n\nMr. Emilius was after Portray Castle, and had been after Portray\nCastle in a silent, not very confident, but yet not altogether\nhopeless manner ever since he had seen the glories of that place, and\nlearned something of truth as to the widow's income. Mrs. Carbuncle\nwas led to her conclusion not simply by the wedding present, but in\npart also by the diligence displayed by Mr. Emilius in removing the\ndoubts which had got abroad respecting his condition in life. He\nassured Mrs. Carbuncle that he had never been married. Shortly after\nhis ordination, which had been effected under the hands of that great\nand good man the late Bishop of Jerusalem, he had taken to live with\nhim a lady who was-- Mrs. Carbuncle did not quite recollect who the\nlady was, but remembered that she was connected in some way with a\nstep-mother of Mr. Emilius who lived in Bohemia. This lady had for\nawhile kept house for Mr. Emilius;--but ill-natured things had been\nsaid, and Mr. Emilius, having respect to his cloth, had sent the poor\nlady back to Bohemia. The consequence was that he now lived in a\nsolitude which was absolute, and, as Mr. Emilius added, somewhat\nmelancholy. All this Mr. Emilius explained very fully, not to Lizzie\nherself, but to Mrs. Carbuncle. If Lady Eustace chose to entertain\nsuch a suitor, why should he not come? It was nothing to Mrs.\nCarbuncle.\n\nLizzie laughed when she was told that she might add the reverend\ngentleman to the list of her admirers. \"Don't you remember,\" she\nsaid, \"how we used to chaff Miss Macnulty about him?\"\n\n\"I knew better than that,\" replied Mrs. Carbuncle.\n\n\"There is no saying what a man may be after,\" said Lizzie. \"I didn't\nknow but what he might have thought that Macnulty's connexions would\nincrease his congregation.\"\n\n\"He's after you, my dear, and your income. He can manage a\ncongregation for himself.\"\n\nLizzie was very civil to him, but it would be unjust to her to say\nthat she gave him any encouragement. It is quite the proper thing for\na lady to be on intimate, and even on affectionate, terms with her\nfavourite clergyman, and Lizzie certainly had intercourse with no\nclergyman who was a greater favourite with her than Mr. Emilius. She\nhad a dean for an uncle, and a bishop for an uncle-in-law; but she\nwas at no pains to hide her contempt for these old fogies of the\nChurch. \"They preach now and then in the cathedral,\" she said to Mr.\nEmilius, \"and everybody takes the opportunity of going to sleep.\" Mr.\nEmilius was very much amused at this description of the eloquence of\nthe dignitaries. It was quite natural to him that people should go to\nsleep in church who take no trouble in seeking eloquent preachers.\n\"Ah,\" he said, \"the Church in England, which is my Church,--the\nChurch which I love,--is beautiful. She is as a maiden, all glorious\nwith fine raiment. But alas! she is mute. She does not sing. She has\nno melody. But the time cometh in which she shall sing. I, myself,--I\nam a poor singer in the great choir.\" In saying which Mr. Emilius no\ndoubt intended to allude to his eloquence as a preacher.\n\nHe was a man who could listen as well as sing, and he was very\ncareful to hear well that which was being said in public about Lady\nEustace and her diamonds. He had learned thoroughly what was her\ncondition in reference to the Portray estate, and was rejoiced rather\nthan otherwise to find that she enjoyed only a life-interest in the\nproperty. Had the thing been better than it was, it would have been\nthe further removed from his reach. And in the same way, when rumours\nreached him prejudicial to Lizzie in respect of the diamonds, he\nperceived that such prejudice might work weal for him. A gentleman\nonce, on ordering a mackerel for dinner, was told that a fresh\nmackerel would come to a shilling. He could have a stale mackerel for\nsixpence. \"Then bring me a stale mackerel,\" said the gentleman. Mr.\nEmilius coveted fish, but was aware that his position did not justify\nhim in expecting the best fish on the market. The Lord Fawns and the\nFrank Greystocks of the world would be less likely to covet Lizzie,\nshould she, by any little indiscretion, have placed herself under a\ntemporary cloud. Mr. Emilius had carefully observed the heavens, and\nknew how quickly such clouds will disperse themselves when they are\ntinged with gold. There was nothing which Lizzie had done, or would\nbe likely to do, which could materially affect her income. It might\nindeed be possible that the Eustaces should make her pay for the\nnecklace; but even in that case, there would be quite enough left for\nthat modest, unambitious comfort which Mr. Emilius desired. It was by\npreaching, and not by wealth, that he must make himself known in the\nworld!--but for a preacher to have a pretty wife with a title and a\ngood income,--and a castle in Scotland,--what an Elysium it would be!\nIn such a condition he would envy no dean, no bishop,--no archbishop!\nHe thought a great deal about it, and saw no positive bar to his\nsuccess.\n\nShe told him that she was going to Scotland. \"Not immediately!\" he\nexclaimed.\n\n\"My little boy is there,\" she said.\n\n\"But why should not your little boy be here? Surely, for people who\ncan choose, the great centre of the world offers attractions which\ncannot be found in secluded spots.\"\n\n\"I love seclusion,\" said Lizzie, with rapture.\n\n\"Ah, yes; I can believe that.\" Mr. Emilius had himself witnessed the\nseclusion of Portray Castle, and had heard, when there, many stories\nof the Ayrshire hunting. \"It is your nature;--but, dear Lady Eustace,\nwill you allow me to say that our nature is implanted in us in\naccordance with the Fall?\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say that it is wicked to like to be in Scotland\nbetter than in this giddy town?\"\n\n\"I say nothing about wicked, Lady Eustace; but this I do say, that\nnature alone will not lead us always aright. It is good to be at\nPortray part of the year, no doubt; but are there not blessings in\nsuch a congregation of humanity as this London which you cannot find\nat Portray?\"\n\n\"I can hear you preach, Mr. Emilius, certainly.\"\n\n\"I hope that is something, too, Lady Eustace;--otherwise a great many\npeople who kindly come to hear me must sadly waste their time. And\nyour example to the world around;--is it not more serviceable amidst\nthe crowds of London than in the solitudes of Scotland? There is more\ngood to be done, Lady Eustace, by living among our fellow-creatures\nthan by deserting them. Therefore I think you should not go to\nScotland before August, but should have your little boy brought to\nyou here.\"\n\n\"The air of his native mountains is everything to my child,\" said\nLizzie. The child had, in fact, been born at Bobsborough, but that\nprobably would make no real difference.\n\n\"You cannot wonder that I should plead for your stay,\" said Mr.\nEmilius, throwing all his soul into his eyes. \"How dark would\neverything be to me if I missed you from your seat in the house of\npraise and prayer!\"\n\nLizzie Eustace, like some other ladies who ought to be more\nappreciative, was altogether deficient in what may perhaps be called\ngood taste in reference to men. Though she was clever, and though,\nin spite of her ignorance, she at once knew an intelligent man from\na fool, she did not know the difference between a gentleman and\na--\"cad.\" It was in her estimation something against Mr. Emilius that\nhe was a clergyman, something against him that he had nothing but\nwhat he earned, something against him that he was supposed to be a\nrenegade Jew, and that nobody knew whence he came nor who he was.\nThese deficiencies or drawbacks Lizzie recognised. But it was nothing\nagainst him in her judgment that he was a greasy, fawning, pawing,\ncreeping, black-browed rascal, who could not look her full in the\nface, and whose every word sounded like a lie. There was a twang\nin his voice which ought to have told her that he was utterly\nuntrustworthy. There was an oily pretence at earnestness in his\nmanner which ought to have told that he was not fit to associate with\ngentlemen. There was a foulness of demeanour about him which ought to\nhave given to her, as a woman at any rate brought up among ladies,\nan abhorrence of his society. But all this Lizzie did not feel. She\nridiculed to Mrs. Carbuncle the idea of the preacher's courtship.\nShe still thought that in the teeth of all her misfortunes she could\ndo better with herself than marry Mr. Emilius. She conceived that\nthe man must be impertinent if Mrs. Carbuncle's assertions were\ntrue;--but she was neither angry nor disgusted, and she allowed\nhim to talk to her, and even to make love to her, after his nasty\npseudo-clerical fashion.\n\nShe could surely still do better with herself than marry Mr. Emilius!\nIt was now the twentieth of March, and a fortnight had gone since an\nintimation had been sent to her from the headquarters of the police\nthat Patience Crabstick was in their hands. Nothing further had\noccurred, and it might be that Patience Crabstick had told no tale\nagainst her. She could not bring herself to believe that Patience had\nno tale to tell, but it might be that Patience, though she was in the\nhands of the police, would find it to her interest to tell no tale\nagainst her late mistress. At any rate, there was silence and quiet,\nand the affair of the diamonds seemed almost to be passing out of\npeople's minds. Greystock had twice called in Scotland Yard, but had\nbeen able to learn nothing. It was feared, they said, that the people\nreally engaged in the robbery had got away scot-free. Frank did\nnot quite believe them, but he could learn nothing from them. Thus\nencouraged, Lizzie determined that she would remain in London till\nafter Lucinda's marriage,--till after she should have received the\npromised letter from Lord Fawn, as to which, though it was so long in\ncoming, she did not doubt that it would come at last. She could do\nnothing with Frank,--who was a fool! She could do nothing with Lord\nGeorge,--who was a brute! Lord Fawn would still be within her reach,\nif only the secret about the diamonds could be kept a secret till\nafter she should have become his wife.\n\nAbout this time Lucinda spoke to her respecting her proposed journey.\n\"You were talking of going to Scotland a week ago, Lady Eustace.\"\n\n\"And am still talking of it.\"\n\n\"Aunt Jane says that you are waiting for my wedding. It is very kind\nof you;--but pray don't do that.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't think of going now till after your marriage. It only\nwants ten or twelve days.\"\n\n\"I count them. I know how many days it wants. It may want more than\nthat.\"\n\n\"You can't put it off now, I should think,\" said Lizzie; \"and as I\nhave ordered my dress for the occasion I shall certainly stay and\nwear it.\"\n\n\"I am very sorry for your dress. I am very sorry for it all. Do you\nknow;--I sometimes think I shall--murder him.\"\n\n\"Lucinda,--how can you say anything so horrible! But I see you are\nonly joking.\" There did come a ghastly smile over that beautiful\nface, which was so seldom lighted up by any expression of mirth or\ngood humour. \"But I wish you would not say such horrible things.\"\n\n\"It would serve him right;--and if he were to murder me, that would\nserve me right. He knows that I detest him, and yet he goes on with\nit. I have told him so a score of times, but nothing will make him\ngive it up. It is not that he loves me, but he thinks that that will\nbe his triumph.\"\n\n\"Why don't you give it up, if it makes you unhappy?\"\n\n\"It ought to come from him,--ought it not?\"\n\n\"I don't see why,\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"He is not bound to anybody as I am bound to my aunt. No one can have\nexacted an oath from him. Lady Eustace, you don't quite understand\nhow we are situated. I wonder whether you would take the trouble to\nbe good to me?\"\n\nLucinda Roanoke had never asked a favour of her before;--had never,\nto Lizzie's knowledge, asked a favour of any one. \"In what way can I\nbe good to you?\" she said.\n\n\"Make him give it up. You may tell him what you like of me. Tell him\nthat I shall only make him miserable, and more despicable than he\nis;--that I shall never be a good wife to him. Tell him that I am\nthoroughly bad, and that he will repent it to the last day of his\nlife. Say whatever you like,--but make him give it up.\"\n\n\"When everything has been prepared!\"\n\n\"What does all that signify compared to a life of misery? Lady\nEustace, I really think that I should--kill him, if he really\nwere--were my husband.\" Lizzie at last said that she would, at any\nrate, speak to Sir Griffin.\n\nAnd she did speak to Sir Griffin, having waited three or four days\nfor an opportunity to do so. There had been some desperately sharp\nwords between Sir Griffin and Mrs. Carbuncle with reference to money.\nSir Griffin had been given to understand that Lucinda had, or would\nhave, some few hundred pounds, and insisted that the money should be\nhanded over to him on the day of his marriage. Mrs. Carbuncle had\ndeclared that the money was to come from property to be realised in\nNew York, and had named a day which had seemed to Sir Griffin to be\nas the Greek Kalends. He expressed an opinion that he was swindled,\nand Mrs. Carbuncle, unable to restrain herself, had turned upon him\nfull of wrath. He was caught by Lizzie as he was descending the\nstairs, and in the dining-room he poured out the tale of his wrongs.\n\"That woman doesn't know what fair dealing means,\" said he.\n\n\"That's a little hard, Sir Griffin, isn't it?\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"Not a bit. A trumpery six hundred pounds! And she hasn't a shilling\nof fortune, and never will have, beyond that! No fellow ever was more\ngenerous or more foolish than I have been.\" Lizzie, as she heard\nthis, could not refrain from thinking of the poor departed Sir\nFlorian. \"I didn't look for fortune, or say a word about money, as\nalmost every man does,--but just took her as she was. And now she\ntells me that I can't have just the bit of money that I wanted for\nour tour. It would serve them both right if I were to give it up.\"\n\n\"Why don't you?\" said Lizzie. He looked quickly, sharply, and closely\ninto her face as she asked the question. \"I would, if I thought as\nyou do.\"\n\n\"And lay myself in for all manner of damages,\" said Sir Griffin.\n\n\"There wouldn't be anything of that kind, I'm sure. You see, the\ntruth is, you and Miss Roanoke are always having--having little tiffs\ntogether. I sometimes think you don't really care a bit for her.\"\n\n\"It's the old woman I'm complaining of,\" said Sir Griffin, \"and I'm\nnot going to marry her. I shall have seen the last of her when I get\nout of the church, Lady Eustace.\"\n\n\"Do you think she wishes it?\"\n\n\"Who do you mean?\" asked Sir Griffin.\n\n\"Why;--Lucinda.\"\n\n\"Of course she does. Where'd she be now if it wasn't to go on? I\ndon't believe they've money enough between them to pay the rent of\nthe house they're living in.\"\n\n\"Of course, I don't want to make difficulties, Sir Griffin, and no\ndoubt the affair has gone very far now. But I really think Lucinda\nwould consent to break it off if you wish it. I have never thought\nthat you were really in love with her.\"\n\nHe again looked at her very sharply and very closely. \"Has she sent\nyou to say all this?\"\n\n\"Has who sent me? Mrs. Carbuncle didn't.\"\n\n\"But Lucinda?\"\n\nShe paused for a moment before she replied;--but she could not bring\nherself to be absolutely honest in the matter. \"No;--she didn't send\nme. But from what I see and hear, I am quite sure she does not wish\nto go on with it.\"\n\n\"Then she shall go on with it,\" said Sir Griffin. \"I'm not going to\nbe made a fool of in that way. She shall go on with it; and the first\nthing I mean to tell her as my wife is, that she shall never see\nthat woman again. If she thinks she's going to be master, she's very\nmuch mistaken.\" Sir Griffin, as he said this, showed his teeth, and\ndeclared his purpose to be masterful by his features as well as by\nhis words;--but Lady Eustace was, nevertheless, of opinion that when\nthe two came to an absolute struggle for mastery, the lady would get\nthe better of it.\n\nLizzie never told Miss Roanoke of her want of success, or even of\nthe effort she had made; nor did the unhappy young woman come to her\nfor any reply. The preparations went on, and it was quite understood\nthat on this peculiar occasion Mrs. Carbuncle intended to treat her\nfriends with profuse hospitality. She proposed to give a breakfast;\nand as the house in Hertford Street was very small, rooms had been\ntaken at an hotel in Albemarle Street. Thither, as the day of the\nmarriage drew near, all the presents were taken,--so that they might\nbe viewed by the guests, with the names of the donors attached to\nthem. As some of the money given had been very much wanted indeed, so\nthat the actual cheques could not be conveniently spared just at the\nmoment to pay for the presents which ought to have been bought,--a\nfew very pretty things were hired, as to which, when the donors\nshould see their names attached to them, they should surely think\nthat the money given had been laid out to great advantage.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXVII\n\nThe Eye of the Public\n\n\nIt took Lord Fawn a long time to write his letter, but at last\nhe wrote it. The delay must not be taken as throwing any slur on\nhis character as a correspondent or a man of business, for many\nirritating causes sprang up sufficient to justify him in pleading\nthat it arose from circumstances beyond his own control. It is,\nmoreover, felt by us all that the time which may fairly be taken in\nthe performance of any task depends, not on the amount of work, but\non the performance of it when done. A man is not expected to write a\ncheque for a couple of thousand pounds as readily as he would one for\nfive,--unless he be a man to whom a couple of thousand pounds is a\nmere nothing. To Lord Fawn the writing of this letter was everything.\nHe had told Lizzie, with much exactness, what he would put into it.\nHe would again offer his hand,--acknowledging himself bound to do\nso by his former offer,--but would give reasons why she should not\naccept it. If anything should occur in the meantime which would, in\nhis opinion, justify him in again repudiating her, he would of course\ntake advantage of such circumstance. If asked himself what was his\nprevailing motive in all that he did or intended to do, he would have\ndeclared that it was above all things necessary that he should \"put\nhimself right in the eye of the British public.\"\n\nBut he was not able to do this without interference from the judgment\nof others. Both Mr. and Mrs. Hittaway interfered; and he could not\nprevent himself from listening to them and believing them, though he\nwould contradict all they said, and snub all their theories. Frank\nGreystock also continued to interfere, and Lady Glencora Palliser.\nEven John Eustace had been worked upon to write to Lord Fawn, stating\nhis opinion, as trustee for his late brother's property, that the\nEustace family did not think that there was ground of complaint\nagainst Lady Eustace in reference to the diamonds which had been\nstolen. This was a terrible blow to Lord Fawn, and had come, no\ndoubt, from a general agreement among the Eustace faction,--including\nthe bishop, John Eustace, and even Mr. Camperdown,--that it would be\na good thing to get the widow married and placed under some decent\ncontrol.\n\nLady Glencora absolutely had the effrontery to ask him whether the\nmarriage was not going to take place, and when a day would be fixed.\nHe gathered up his courage to give her ladyship a rebuke. \"My private\naffairs do seem to be uncommonly interesting,\" he said.\n\n\"Why, yes, Lord Fawn,\" said Lady Glencora, whom nothing could\nabash;--\"most interesting. You see, dear Lady Eustace is so very\npopular, that we all want to know what is to be her fate.\"\n\n\"I regret to say that I cannot answer your ladyship's question with\nany precision,\" said Lord Fawn.\n\nBut the Hittaway persecution was by far the worst. \"You have seen\nher, Frederic?\" said his sister.\n\n\"Yes,--I have.\"\n\n\"You have made her no promise?\"\n\n\"My dear Clara, this is a matter in which I must use my own\njudgment.\"\n\n\"But the family, Frederic?\"\n\n\"I do not think that any member of our family has a just right to\ncomplain of my conduct since I have had the honour of being its head.\nI have endeavoured so to live that my actions should encounter no\nprivate or public censure. If I fail to meet with your approbation,\nI shall grieve; but I cannot on that account act otherwise than in\naccordance with my own judgment.\"\n\nMrs. Hittaway knew her brother well, and was not afraid of him.\n\"That's all very well; and I am sure you know, Frederic, how\nproud we all are of you. But this woman is a nasty, low, scheming,\nill-conducted, dishonest little wretch; and if you make her your wife\nyou'll be miserable all your life. Nothing would make me and Orlando\nso unhappy as to quarrel with you. But we know that it is so, and to\nthe last minute I shall say so. Why don't you ask her to her face\nabout that man down in Scotland?\"\n\n\"My dear Clara, perhaps I know what to ask her and what not to ask\nher better than you can tell me.\"\n\nAnd his brother-in-law was quite as bad. \"Fawn,\" he said, \"in this\nmatter of Lady Eustace, don't you think you ought to put your conduct\ninto the hands of some friend?\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"I think it is an affair in which a man would have so much comfort in\nbeing able to say that he was guided by advice. Of course, her people\nwant you to marry her. Now, if you could just tell them that the\nwhole thing was in the hands of,--say me,--or any other friend, you\nwould be relieved, you know, of so much responsibility. They might\nhammer away at me ever so long, and I shouldn't care twopence.\"\n\n\"If there is to be any hammering, it cannot be borne vicariously,\"\nsaid Lord Fawn,--and as he said it, he was quite pleased by his own\nsharpness and wit.\n\nHe had, indeed, put himself beyond protection by vicarious endurance\nof hammering when he promised to write to Lady Eustace, explaining\nhis own conduct and giving reasons. Had anything turned up in\nScotland Yard which would have justified him in saying,--or even in\nthinking,--that Lizzie had stolen her own diamonds, he would have\nsent word to her that he must abstain from any communication till\nthat matter had been cleared up; but since the appearance of that\nmysterious paragraph in the newspapers, nothing had been heard of\nthe robbery, and public opinion certainly seemed to be in favour\nof Lizzie's innocence. He did think that the Eustace faction was\nbetraying him, as he could not but remember how eager Mr. Camperdown\nhad been in asserting that the widow was keeping an enormous amount\nof property and claiming it as her own, whereas, in truth, she\nhad not the slightest title to it. It was, in a great measure, in\nconsequence of the assertions of the Eustace faction, almost in\nobedience to their advice, that he had resolved to break off the\nmatch; and now they turned upon him, and John Eustace absolutely went\nout of his way to write him a letter which was clearly meant to imply\nthat he, Lord Fawn, was bound to marry the woman to whom he had once\nengaged himself! Lord Fawn felt that he was ill-used, and that a man\nmight have to undergo a great deal of bad treatment who should strive\nto put himself right in the eye of the public.\n\nAt last he wrote his letter,--on a Wednesday, which with him had\nsomething of the comfort of a half-holiday, as on that day he was not\nrequired to attend Parliament.\n\n\n   India Office, 28th March, 18--.\n\n   MY DEAR LADY EUSTACE,\n\n   In accordance with the promise which I made to you when\n   I did myself the honour of waiting upon you in Hertford\n   Street, I take up my pen with the view of communicating\n   to you the result of my deliberations respecting the\n   engagement of marriage which, no doubt, did exist between\n   us last summer.\n\n   Since that time I have no doubt taken upon myself to say\n   that that engagement was over; and I am free to admit that\n   I did so without any assent or agreement on your part to\n   that effect. Such conduct no doubt requires a valid and\n   strong defence. My defence is as follows:--\n\n   I learned that you were in possession of a large amount\n   of property, vested in diamonds, which was claimed by the\n   executors under your late husband's will as belonging to\n   his estate; and as to which they declared, in the most\n   positive manner, that you had no right or title to it\n   whatever. I consulted friends and I consulted lawyers, and\n   I was led to the conviction that this property certainly\n   did not belong to you. Had I married you in these\n   circumstances, I could not but have become a participator\n   in the lawsuit which I was assured would be commenced. I\n   could not be a participator with you, because I believed\n   you to be in the wrong. And I certainly could not\n   participate with those who would in such case be attacking\n   my own wife.\n\n   In this condition of things I requested you,--as you\n   must, I think, yourself own, with all deference and\n   good feeling,--to give up the actual possession of\n   the property, and to place the diamonds in neutral\n   hands,--[Lord Fawn was often called upon to be neutral\n   in reference to the condition of outlying Indian\n   principalities]--till the law should have decided as to\n   their ownership. As regards myself, I neither coveted nor\n   rejected the possession of that wealth for my future wife.\n   I desired simply to be free from an embarrassment which\n   would have overwhelmed me. You declined my request,--not\n   only positively, but perhaps I may add peremptorily;\n   and then I was bound to adhere to the decision I had\n   communicated to you.\n\n   Since that time the property has been stolen and, as I\n   believe, dissipated. The lawsuit against you has been\n   withdrawn; and the bone of contention, so to say, is no\n   longer existing. I am no longer justified in declining\n   to keep my engagement because of the prejudice to which\n   I should have been subjected by your possession of the\n   diamonds;--and, therefore, as far as that goes, I withdraw\n   my withdrawal. [This Lord Fawn thought was rather a happy\n   phrase, and he read it aloud to himself more than once.]\n\n   But now there arises the question whether, in both our\n   interests, this marriage should go on, or whether it may\n   not be more conducive to your happiness and to mine that\n   it should be annulled for causes altogether irrespective\n   of the diamonds. In a matter so serious as marriage, the\n   happiness of the two parties is that which requires graver\n   thought than any other consideration.\n\n   There has no doubt sprung up between us a feeling of\n   mutual distrust, which has led to recrimination, and which\n   is hardly compatible with that perfect confidence which\n   should exist between a man and his wife. This first arose,\n   no doubt, from the different views which we took as to\n   that property of which I have spoken,--and as to which\n   your judgment may possibly have been better than mine. On\n   that head I will add nothing to what I have already said;\n   but the feeling has arisen; and I fear it cannot be so\n   perfectly allayed as to admit of that reciprocal trust\n   without which we could not live happily together. I\n   confess that for my own part I do not now desire a union\n   which was once the great object of my ambition,--and that\n   I could not go to the altar with you without fear and\n   trembling. As to your own feelings, you best know what\n   they are. I bring no charge against you;--but if you have\n   ceased to love me, I think you should cease to wish to be\n   my wife, and that you should not insist upon a marriage\n   simply because by doing so you would triumph over a former\n   objection.\n\n\nBefore he finished this paragraph, he thought much of Andy Gowran and\nof the scene among the rocks of which he had heard. But he could not\nspeak of it. He had found himself unable to examine the witness who\nhad been brought to him, and had honestly told himself that he could\nnot take that charge as proved. Andy Gowran might have lied. In his\nheart he believed that Andy Gowran had lied. The matter was\ndistasteful to him, and he would not touch it. And yet he knew that\nthe woman did not love him, and he longed to tell her so.\n\n\n   As to what we might each gain or each lose in a worldly\n   point of view, either by marrying or not marrying, I will\n   not say a word. You have rank and wealth, and therefore I\n   can comfort myself by thinking that if I dissuade you from\n   this marriage I shall rob you of neither. I acknowledge\n   that I wish to dissuade you, as I believe that we should\n   not make each other happy. As, however, I do consider that\n   I am bound to keep my engagement to you if you demand\n   that I shall do so, I leave the matter in your hands for\n   decision.\n\n   I am, and shall remain,\n\n   Your sincere friend,\n\n   FAWN.\n\n\nHe read the letter and copied it, and gave himself great credit for\nthe composition. He thought that it was impossible that any woman\nafter reading it should express a wish to become the wife of the man\nwho wrote it; and yet,--so he believed,--no man or woman could find\nfault with him for writing it. There certainly was one view of the\ncase which was very distressing. How would it be with him if, after\nall, she should say that she would marry him? After having given\nher her choice,--having put it all in writing,--he could not again\ngo back from it. He would be in her power, and of what use would\nhis life be to him? Would Parliament, or the India Office, or the\neye of the public be able to comfort him then in the midst of his\nmany miseries? What could he do with a wife whom he married with a\ndeclaration that he disliked her? With such feelings as were his, how\ncould he stand before a clergyman and take an oath that he would love\nher and cherish her? Would she not ever be as an adder to him,--as\nan adder whom it would be impossible that he should admit into his\nbosom? Could he live in the same house with her; and if so, could he\nask his mother and sisters to visit her? He remembered well what Mrs.\nHittaway had called her;--a nasty, low, scheming, ill-conducted,\ndishonest little wretch! And he believed that she was so! Yet he was\nonce again offering to marry her, should she choose to accept him.\n\nNevertheless, the letter was sent. There was, in truth, no\nalternative. He had promised that he would write such a letter, and\nall that had remained to him was the power of cramming into it every\navailable argument against the marriage. This he had done, and, as he\nthought, had done well. It was impossible that she should desire to\nmarry him after reading such a letter as that!\n\nLizzie received it in her bedroom, where she breakfasted, and told\nof its arrival to her friend Mrs. Carbuncle as soon as they met each\nother. \"My lord has come down from his high horse at last,\" she said,\nwith the letter in her hand.\n\n\"What,--Lord Fawn?\"\n\n\"Yes; Lord Fawn. What other lord? There is no other lord for me. He\nis my lord, my peer of Parliament, my Cabinet minister, my right\nhonourable, my member of the Government,--my young man, too, as the\nmaid-servants call them.\"\n\n\"What does he say?\"\n\n\"Say;--what should he say?--just that he has behaved very badly, and\nthat he hopes I shall forgive him.\"\n\n\"Not quite that; does he?\"\n\n\"That's what it all means. Of course, there is ever so much of\nit,--pages of it. It wouldn't be Lord Fawn if he didn't spin it all\nout like an Act of Parliament, with 'whereas' and 'wherein,' and\n'whereof.' It is full of all that; but the meaning of it is that he's\nat my feet again, and that I may pick him up if I choose to take him.\nI'd show you the letter, only perhaps it wouldn't be fair to the poor\nman.\"\n\n\"What excuse does he make?\"\n\n\"Oh,--as to that he's rational enough. He calls the necklace\nthe--bone of contention. That's rather good for Lord Fawn; isn't it?\nThe bone of contention, he says, has been removed; and, therefore,\nthere is no reason why we shouldn't marry if we like it. He shall\nhear enough about the bone of contention if we do 'marry.'\"\n\n\"And what shall you do now?\"\n\n\"Ah, yes; that's easily asked; is it not? The man's a good sort of\nman in his way, you know. He doesn't drink or gamble; and I don't\nthink there is a bit of the King David about him,--that I don't.\"\n\n\"Virtue personified, I should say.\"\n\n\"And he isn't extravagant.\"\n\n\"Then why not have him and have done with it?\" asked Mrs. Carbuncle.\n\n\"He is such a lumpy man,\" said Lizzie;--\"such an ass; such a load of\nGovernment waste-paper.\"\n\n\"Come, my dear;--you've had troubles.\"\n\n\"I have, indeed,\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"And there's no quite knowing yet how far they're over.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that, Mrs. Carbuncle?\"\n\n\"Nothing very much;--but still, you see, they may come again. As to\nLord George, we all know that he has not got a penny-piece in the\nworld that he can call his own.\"\n\n\"If he had as many pennies as Judas, Lord George would be nothing to\nme,\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"And your cousin really doesn't seem to mean anything.\"\n\n\"I know very well what my cousin means. He and I understand each\nother thoroughly; but cousins can love one another very well without\nmarrying.\"\n\n\"Of course you know your own business, but if I were you I would take\nLord Fawn. I speak in true kindness,--as one woman to another. After\nall, what does love signify? How much real love do we ever see among\nmarried people? Does Lady Glencora Palliser really love her husband,\nwho thinks of nothing in the world but putting taxes on and off?\"\n\n\"Do you love your husband, Mrs. Carbuncle?\"\n\n\"No;--but that is a different kind of thing. Circumstances have\ncaused me to live apart from him. The man is a good man, and there\nis no reason why you should not respect him, and treat him well. He\nwill give you a fixed position,--which really you want badly, Lady\nEustace.\"\n\n\"Tooriloo, tooriloo, tooriloo, looriloo,\" said Lizzie, in\ncontemptuous disdain of her friend's caution.\n\n\"And then all this trouble about the diamonds and the robberies\nwill be over,\" continued Mrs. Carbuncle. Lizzie looked at her very\nintently. What should make Mrs. Carbuncle suppose that there need be,\nor, indeed, could be, any further trouble about the diamonds?\n\n\"So;--that's your advice,\" said Lizzie. \"I'm half inclined to take\nit, and perhaps I shall. However, I have brought him round, and\nthat's something, my dear. And either one way or the other, I shall\nlet him know that I like my triumph. I was determined to have it, and\nI've got it.\"\n\nThen she read the letter again very seriously. Could she possibly\nmarry a man who in so many words told her that he didn't want her?\nWell;--she thought she could. Was not everybody treating everybody\nelse much in the same way? Had she not loved her Corsair truly,--and\nhow had he treated her? Had she not been true, disinterested, and\nmost affectionate to Frank Greystock; and what had she got from\nhim? To manage her business wisely, and put herself upon firm\nground;--that was her duty at present. Mrs. Carbuncle was right\nthere. The very name of Lady Fawn would be a rock to her,--and she\nwanted a rock. She thought upon the whole that she could marry\nhim;--unless Patience Crabstick and the police should again interfere\nwith her prosperity.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXVIII\n\nThe Major\n\n\nLady Eustace did not intend to take as much time in answering Lord\nFawn's letter as he had taken in writing it; but even she found\nthat the subject was one which demanded a good deal of thought. Mrs.\nCarbuncle had very freely recommended her to take the man, supporting\nher advice by arguments which Lizzie felt to be valid; but then Mrs.\nCarbuncle did not know all the circumstances. Mrs. Carbuncle had not\nactually seen his lordship's letter; and though the great part of\nthe letter, the formal repetition, namely, of the writer's offer of\nmarriage, had been truly told to her, still, as the reader will have\nperceived, she had been kept in the dark as to some of the details.\nLizzie did sit at her desk with the object of putting a few words\ntogether in order that she might see how they looked, and she found\nthat there was a difficulty. \"My dear Lord Fawn. As we have been\nengaged to marry each other, and as all our friends have been told, I\nthink that the thing had better go on.\" That, after various attempts,\nwas, she thought, the best letter that she could send,--if she should\nmake up her mind to be Lady Fawn. But, on the morning of the 30th\nof March she had not sent her letter. She had told herself that\nshe would take two days to think of her reply,--and, on the Friday\nmorning the few words she had prepared were still lying in her desk.\n\nWhat was she to get by marrying a man she absolutely disliked?\nThat he also absolutely disliked her was not a matter much in her\nthoughts. The man would not ill-treat her because he disliked her;\nor, it might perhaps be juster to say, that the ill-treatment which\nshe might fairly anticipate would not be of a nature which would much\naffect her comfort grievously. He would not beat her, nor rob her,\nnor lock her up, nor starve her. He would either neglect her, or\npreach sermons to her. For the first she could console herself by the\nattention of others; and should he preach, perhaps she could preach\ntoo,--as sharply if not as lengthily as his lordship. At any rate,\nshe was not afraid of him. But what would she gain? It is very\nwell to have a rock, as Mrs. Carbuncle had said, but a rock is not\neverything. She did not know whether she cared much for living upon\na rock. Even stability may be purchased at too high a price. There\nwas not a grain of poetry in the whole composition of Lord Fawn, and\npoetry was what her very soul craved;--poetry, together with houses,\nchampagne, jewels, and admiration. Her income was still her own, and\nshe did not quite see that the rock was so absolutely necessary to\nher. Then she wrote another note to Lord Fawn, a specimen of a note,\nso that she might have the opportunity of comparing the two. This\nnote took her much longer than the one first written.\n\n\n   MY LORD,--\n\n   I do not know how to acknowledge with sufficient humility\n   the condescension and great kindness of your lordship's\n   letter. But perhaps its manly generosity is more\n   conspicuous than either. The truth is, my lord, you want\n   to escape from your engagement, but are too much afraid\n   of the consequences to dare to do so by any act of your\n   own;--therefore you throw it upon me. You are quite\n   successful. I don't think you ever read poetry, but\n   perhaps you may understand the two following lines:--\n\n      \"I am constrained to say, your lordship's scullion\n       Should sooner be my husband than yourself.\"\n\n   I see through you, and despise you thoroughly.\n\n   E. EUSTACE.\n\n\nShe was comparing the two answers together, very much in doubt as to\nwhich should be sent, when there came a message to her by a man whom\nshe knew to be a policeman, though he did not announce himself as\nsuch, and was dressed in plain clothes. Major Mackintosh sent his\ncompliments to her, and would wait upon her that afternoon at three\no'clock, if she would have the kindness to receive him. At the first\nmoment of seeing the man she felt that after all the rock was what\nshe wanted. Mrs. Carbuncle was right. She had had troubles and might\nhave more, and the rock was the thing. But then the more certainly\ndid she become convinced of this by the presence of the major's\nmessenger, the more clearly did she see the difficulty of attaining\nthe security which the rock offered. If this public exposure should\nfall upon her, Lord Fawn's renewed offer, as she knew well, would\nstand for nothing. If once it were known that she had kept the\nnecklace,--her own necklace,--under her pillow at Carlisle, he would\nwant no further justification in repudiating her, were it for the\ntenth time.\n\nShe was very uncivil to the messenger, and the more so because she\nfound that the man bore her rudeness without turning upon her and\nrending her. When she declared that the police had behaved very\nbadly, and that Major Mackintosh was inexcusable in troubling\nher again, and that she had ceased to care twopence about the\nnecklace,--the man made no remonstrance to her petulance. He owned\nthat the trouble was very great, and the police very inefficient. He\nalmost owned that the major was inexcusable. He did not care what he\nowned so that he achieved his object. But when Lizzie said that she\ncould not see Major Mackintosh at three, and objected equally to two,\nfour, or five; then the courteous messenger from Scotland Yard did\nsay a word to make her understand that there must be a meeting,--and\nhe hinted also that the major was doing a most unusually good-natured\nthing in coming to Hertford Street. Of course, Lizzie made the\nappointment. If the major chose to come, she would be at home at\nthree.\n\nAs soon as the policeman was gone, she sat alone, with a manner very\nmuch changed from that which she had worn since the arrival of Lord\nFawn's letter,--with a fresh weight of care upon her, greater perhaps\nthan she had ever hitherto borne. She had had bad moments,--when, for\ninstance, she had been taken before the magistrates at Carlisle, when\nshe found the police in her house on her return from the theatre, and\nwhen Lord George had forced her secret from her. But at each of these\nperiods hope had come renewed before despair had crushed her. Now it\nseemed to her that the thing was done and that the game was over.\nThis chief man of the London police no doubt knew the whole story.\nIf she could only already have climbed upon some rock, so that there\nmight be a man bound to defend her,--a man at any rate bound to put\nhimself forward on her behalf and do whatever might be done in her\ndefence,--she might have endured it!\n\nWhat should she do now,--at this minute? She looked at her watch and\nfound that it was already past one. Mrs. Carbuncle, as she knew,\nwas closeted up-stairs with Lucinda, whose wedding was fixed for\nthe following Monday. It was now Friday. Were she to call upon Mrs.\nCarbuncle for aid, no aid would be forthcoming unless she were to\ntell the whole truth. She almost thought that she would do so. But\nthen, how great would have been her indiscretion if, after all, when\nthe major should come, she should discover that he did not know the\ntruth himself! That Mrs. Carbuncle would keep her secret she did\nnot for a moment think. She longed for the comfort of some friend's\ncounsel, but she found at last that she could not purchase it by\ntelling everything to a woman.\n\nMight it not be possible that she should still run away? She did not\nknow much of the law, but she thought that they could not punish her\nfor breaking an appointment even with a man so high in authority\nas Major Mackintosh. She could leave a note saying that pressing\nbusiness called her out. But whither should she go? She thought of\ntaking a cab to the House of Commons, finding her cousin, and telling\nhim everything. It would be so much better that he should see the\nmajor. But then again, it might be that she should be mistaken as\nto the amount of the major's information. After a while she almost\ndetermined to fly off at once to Scotland, leaving word that she was\nobliged to go instantly to her child. But there was no direct train\nto Scotland before eight or nine in the evening, and during the\nintervening hours the police would have ample time to find her. What,\nindeed, could she do with herself during these intervening hours?\nAh, if she had but a rock now, so that she need not be dependent\naltogether on the exercise of her own intellect!\n\nGradually the minutes passed by, and she became aware that she must\nface the major. Well! What had she done? She had stolen nothing.\nShe had taken no person's property. She had, indeed, been wickedly\nrobbed, and the police had done nothing to get back for her her\nproperty, as they were bound to have done. She would take care to\ntell the major what she thought about the negligence of the police.\nThe major should not have the talk all to himself.\n\nIf it had not been for one word with which Lord George had stunned\nher ears, she could still have borne it well. She had told a\nlie;--perhaps two or three lies. She knew that she had lied. But\nthen people lie every day. She would not have minded it much if she\nwere simply to be called a liar. But he had told her that she would\nbe accused of--perjury. There was something frightful to her in\nthe name. And there were, she knew not what, dreadful penalties\nattached to it. Lord George had told her that she might be put\nin prison,--whether he had said for years or for months she had\nforgotten. And she thought she had heard of people's property being\nconfiscated to the Crown when they had been made out to be guilty of\ncertain great offences. Oh, how she wished that she had a rock!\n\nWhen three o'clock came she had not started for Scotland or\nelsewhere, and at last she received the major. Could she have\nthoroughly trusted the servant, she would have denied herself at\nthe last moment, but she feared that she might be betrayed, and she\nthought that her position would be rendered even worse than it was\nat present by a futile attempt. She was sitting alone, pale, haggard,\ntrembling, when Major Mackintosh was shown into her room. It may be\nas well explained at once that, at this moment, the major knew, or\nthought that he knew, every circumstance of the two robberies, and\nthat his surmises were in every respect right. Miss Crabstick and\nMr. Cann were in comfortable quarters, and were prepared to tell all\nthat they could tell. Mr. Smiler was in durance, and Mr. Benjamin was\nat Vienna, in the hands of the Austrian police, who were prepared\nto give him up to those who desired his society in England, on the\ncompletion of certain legal formalities. That Mr. Benjamin and Mr.\nSmiler would be prosecuted, the latter for the robbery and the former\nfor conspiracy to rob, and for receiving stolen goods, was a matter\nof course. But what was to be done with Lady Eustace? That, at the\npresent moment, was the prevailing trouble with the police. During\nthe last three weeks every precaution had been taken to keep the\nmatter secret, and it is hardly too much to say that Lizzie's\ninterests were handled not only with consideration but with\ntenderness.\n\n\"Lady Eustace,\" said the major, \"I am very sorry to trouble you. No\ndoubt the man who called on you this morning explained to you who I\nam.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, I know who you are,--quite well.\" Lizzie made a great effort\nto speak without betraying her consternation; but she was nearly\nprostrated. The major, however, hardly observed her, and was by no\nmeans at ease himself in his effort to save her from unnecessary\nannoyance. He was a tall, thin, gaunt man of about forty, with large,\ngood-natured eyes;--but it was not till the interview was half over\nthat Lizzie took courage to look even into his face.\n\n\"Just so; I am come, you know, about the robbery which took place\nhere,--and the other robbery at Carlisle.\"\n\n\"I have been so troubled about these horrid robberies! Sometimes I\nthink they'll be the death of me.\"\n\n\"I think, Lady Eustace, we have found out the whole truth.\"\n\n\"Oh, I daresay. I wonder why--you have been so long--finding it out.\"\n\n\"We have had very clever people to deal with, Lady Eustace;--and I\nfear that, even now, we shall never get back the property.\"\n\n\"I do not care about the property, sir;--although it was all my own.\nNobody has lost anything but myself; and I really don't see why the\nthing should not die out, as I don't care about it. Whoever it is,\nthey may have it now.\"\n\n\"We were bound to get to the bottom of it all, if we could; and I\nthink that we have,--at last. Perhaps, as you say, we ought to have\ndone it sooner.\"\n\n\"Oh,--I don't care.\"\n\n\"We have two persons in custody, Lady Eustace, whom we shall use as\nwitnesses, and I am afraid we shall have to call upon you also,--as\na witness.\" It occurred to Lizzie that they could not lock her up in\nprison and make her a witness too, but she said nothing. Then the\nmajor continued his speech,--and asked her the question which was, in\nfact, alone material. \"Of course, Lady Eustace, you are not bound to\nsay anything to me unless you like it,--and you must understand that\nI by no means wish you to criminate yourself.\"\n\n\"I don't know what that means.\"\n\n\"If you yourself have done anything wrong, I don't want to ask you to\nconfess it.\"\n\n\"I have had all my diamonds stolen, if you mean that. Perhaps it was\nwrong to have diamonds.\"\n\n\"But to come to my question,--I suppose we may take it for granted\nthat the diamonds were in your desk when the thieves made their\nentrance into this house, and broke the desk open, and stole the\nmoney out of it?\" Lizzie breathed so hardly, that she was quite\nunable to speak. The man's voice was very gentle and very kind,--but\nthen how could she admit that one fact? All depended on that one\nfact. \"The woman Crabstick,\" said the major, \"has confessed, and will\nstate on her oath that she saw the necklace in your hands in Hertford\nStreet, and that she saw it placed in the desk. She then gave\ninformation of this to Benjamin,--as she had before given information\nas to your journey up from Scotland,--and she was introduced to the\ntwo men whom she let into the house. One of them, indeed, who will\nalso give evidence for us, she had before met at Carlisle. She then\nwas present when the necklace was taken out of the desk. The man who\nopened the desk and took it out, who also cut the door at Carlisle,\nwill give evidence to the same effect. The man who carried the\nnecklace out of the house, and who broke open the box at Carlisle,\nwill be tried,--as will also Benjamin, who disposed of the diamonds.\nI have told you the whole story, as it has been told to me by the\nwoman Crabstick. Of course, you will deny the truth of it, if it be\nuntrue.\" Lizzie sat with her eyes fixed upon the floor, but said\nnothing. She could not speak. \"If you will allow me, Lady Eustace, to\ngive you advice,--really friendly advice--\"\n\n\"Oh, pray do.\"\n\n\"You had better admit the truth of the story, if it is true.\"\n\n\"They were my own,\" she whispered.\n\n\"Or, at any rate, you believed that they were. There can be no doubt,\nI think, as to that. No one supposes that the robbery at Carlisle was\narranged on your behalf.\"\n\n\"Oh, no.\"\n\n\"But you had taken them out of the box before you went to bed at the\ninn?\"\n\n\"Not then.\"\n\n\"But you had taken them?\"\n\n\"I did it in the morning before I started from Scotland. They\nfrightened me by saying the box would be stolen.\"\n\n\"Exactly;--and then you put them into your desk here, in this house?\"\n\n\"Yes,--sir.\"\n\n\"I should tell you, Lady Eustace, that I had not a doubt about this\nbefore I came here. For some time past I have thought that it must be\nso; and latterly the confessions of two of the accomplices have made\nit certain to me. One of the housebreakers and the jeweller will\nbe tried for the felony, and I am afraid that you must undergo the\nannoyance of being one of the witnesses.\"\n\n\"What will they do to me, Major Mackintosh?\" Lizzie now for the first\ntime looked up into his eyes, and felt that they were kind. Could he\nbe her rock? He did not speak to her like an enemy;--and then, too,\nhe would know better than any man alive how she might best escape\nfrom her trouble.\n\n\"They will ask you to tell the truth.\"\n\n\"Indeed I will do that,\" said Lizzie,--not aware that, after so many\nlies, it might be difficult to tell the truth.\n\n\"And you will probably be asked to repeat it, this way and that, in a\nmanner that will be troublesome to you. You see that here in London,\nand at Carlisle, you have--given incorrect versions.\"\n\n\"I know I have. But the necklace was my own. There was nothing\ndishonest;--was there, Major Mackintosh? When they came to me at\nCarlisle I was so confused that I hardly knew what to tell them. And\nwhen I had once--given an incorrect version, you know, I didn't know\nhow to go back.\"\n\nThe major was not so well acquainted with Lizzie as is the reader,\nand he pitied her. \"I can understand all that,\" he said.\n\nHow much kinder he was than Lord George had been when she confessed\nthe truth to him. Here would be a rock! And such a handsome man as he\nwas, too,--not exactly a Corsair, as he was great in authority over\nthe London police,--but a powerful, fine fellow, who would know what\nto do with swords and pistols as well as any Corsair;--and one, too,\nno doubt, who would understand poetry! Any such dream, however, was\naltogether unavailing, as the major had a wife at home and seven\nchildren. \"If you will only tell me what to do, I will do it,\" she\nsaid, looking up into his face with entreaty, and pressing her hands\ntogether in supplication.\n\nThen at great length, and with much patience, he explained to her\nwhat he would have her do. He thought that, if she were summoned and\nused as a witness, there would be no attempt to prosecute her for\nthe--incorrect versions--of which she had undoubtedly been guilty.\nThe probability was, that she would receive assurance to this effect\nbefore she would be asked to give her evidence, preparatory to the\ncommittal of Benjamin and Smiler. He could not assure her that it\nwould be so, but he had no doubt of it. In order, however, that\nthings might be made to run as smooth as possible, he recommended her\nvery strongly to go at once to Mr. Camperdown and make a clean breast\nof it to him. \"The whole family should be told,\" said the major, \"and\nit will be better for you that they should know it from yourself than\nfrom us.\" When she hesitated, he explained to her that the matter\ncould no longer be kept as a secret, and that her evidence would\ncertainly appear in the papers. He proposed that she should be\nsummoned for that day week,--which would be the Friday after\nLucinda's marriage, and he suggested that she should go to Mr.\nCamperdown's on the morrow. \"What!--to-morrow?\" exclaimed Lizzie, in\ndismay.\n\n\"My dear Lady Eustace,\" said the major, \"the sooner you get back\ninto straight running, the sooner you will be comfortable.\" Then\nshe promised that she would go on the Tuesday,--the day after\nthe marriage. \"If he learns it in the meantime, you must not be\nsurprised,\" said the major.\n\n\"Tell me one thing, Major Mackintosh,\" she said, as she gave him her\nhand at parting,--\"they can't take away from me anything that is my\nown;--can they?\"\n\n\"I don't think they can,\" said the major, escaping rather quickly\nfrom the room.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXIX\n\n\"I Cannot Do It\"\n\n\nThe Saturday and the Sunday Lizzie passed in outward tranquillity,\nthough doubtless her mind was greatly disturbed. She said nothing of\nwhat had passed between her and Major Mackintosh, explaining that\nhis visit had been made solely with the object of informing her that\nMr. Benjamin was to be sent home from Vienna, but that the diamonds\nwere gone for ever. She had, as she declared to herself, agreed with\nMajor Mackintosh that she would not go to Mr. Camperdown till the\nTuesday,--justifying her delay by her solicitude in reference to Miss\nRoanoke's marriage; and therefore these two days were her own. After\nthem would come a totally altered phase of existence. All the world\nwould know the history of the diamonds,--cousin Frank, and Lord Fawn,\nand John Eustace, and Mrs. Carbuncle, and the Bobsborough people,\nand Lady Glencora, and that old vulturess, her aunt, the Countess\nof Linlithgow. It must come now;--but she had two days in which she\ncould be quiet and think of her position. She would, she thought,\nsend one of her letters to Lord Fawn before she went to Mr.\nCamperdown;--but which should she send? Or should she write a third\nexplaining the whole matter in sweetly piteous feminine terms, and\nswearing that the only remaining feeling in her bosom was a devoted\naffection to the man who had now twice promised to be her husband?\n\nIn the meantime the preparations for the great marriage went on.\nMrs. Carbuncle spent her time busily between Lucinda's bedchamber\nand the banqueting hall in Albemarle Street. In spite of pecuniary\ndifficulties the trousseau was to be a wonder; and even Lizzie was\nastonished at the jewellery which that indefatigable woman had\ncollected together for a preliminary show in Hertford Street. She had\nspent hours at Howell and James's, and had made marvellous bargains\nthere and elsewhere. Things were sent for selection, of which the\ngreater portion were to be returned, but all were kept for the show.\nThe same things which were shown to separate friends in Hertford\nStreet as part of the trousseau on Friday and Saturday were carried\nover to Albemarle Street on the Sunday, so as to add to the\nquasi-public exhibition of presents on the Monday. The money expended\nhad gone very far. The most had been made of a failing credit. Every\nparticle of friendly generosity had been so manipulated as to add\nto the external magnificence. And Mrs. Carbuncle had done all this\nwithout any help from Lucinda,--in the midst of most contemptuous\nindifference on Lucinda's part. She could hardly be got to allow\nthe milliners to fit the dresses to her body, and positively\nrefused to thrust her feet into certain golden-heeled boots with\nbrightly-bronzed toes, which were a great feature among the raiment.\nNobody knew it except Mrs. Carbuncle and the maid,--even Lizzie\nEustace did not know it;--but once the bride absolutely ran amuck\namong the finery, scattering the laces here and there, pitching the\nglove-boxes under the bed, chucking the golden-heeled boots into\nthe fire-place, and exhibiting quite a tempest of fury against one\nof the finest shows of petticoats ever arranged with a view to the\nadmiration and envy of female friends. But all this Mrs. Carbuncle\nbore, and still persevered. The thing was so nearly done now that she\ncould endure to persevere though the provocation to abandon it was so\ngreat. She had even ceased to find fault with her niece,--but went on\nin silence counting the hours till the trouble should be taken off\nher own shoulders and placed on those of Sir Griffin. It was a great\nthing to her, almost more than she had expected, that neither Lucinda\nnor Sir Griffin should have positively declined the marriage. It was\nimpossible that either should retreat from it now.\n\nLuckily for Mrs. Carbuncle, Sir Griffin took delight in the show.\nHe did this after a bearish fashion, putting his finger upon little\nflaws with an intelligence for which Mrs. Carbuncle had not hitherto\ngiven him credit. As to certain ornaments, he observed that the\nsilver was plated and the gold ormolu. A \"rope\" of pearls he at once\ndetected as being false,--and after fingering certain lace he turned\nup his nose and shook his head. Then, on the Sunday, in Albemarle\nStreet, he pointed out to Mrs. Carbuncle sundry articles which\nhe had seen in the bedroom on the Saturday. \"But, my dear Sir\nGriffin,--that's of course,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle. \"Oh;--that's of\ncourse, is it?\" said Sir Griffin, turning up his nose again. \"Where\ndid that Delph bowl come from?\" \"It is one of Mortlock's finest\nEtruscan vases,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle. \"Oh,--I thought that Etruscan\nvases came from--from somewhere in Greece or Italy,\" said Sir\nGriffin. \"I declare that you are shocking,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle,\nstruggling to maintain her good humour.\n\nHe passed hours of the Sunday in Hertford Street, and Lord George\nalso was there for some time. Lizzie, who could hardly devote her\nmind to the affairs of the wedding, remained alone in her own\nsitting-room during the greater part of the day;--but she did show\nherself while Lord George was there. \"So I hear that Mackintosh has\nbeen here,\" said Lord George.\n\n\"Yes,--he was here.\"\n\n\"And what did he say?\" Lizzie did not like the way in which the man\nlooked at her, feeling it to be not only unfriendly, but absolutely\ncruel. It seemed to imply that he knew that her secret was about to\nbe divulged. And what was he to her now that he should be impertinent\nto her? What he knew, all the world would know before the end of the\nweek. And that other man who knew it already, had been kind to her,\nhad said nothing about perjury, but had explained to her that what\nshe would have to bear would be trouble, and not imprisonment and\nloss of money. Lord George, to whom she had been so civil, for whom\nshe had spent money, to whom she had almost offered herself and all\nthat she possessed,--Lord George, whom she had selected as the first\nrepository of her secret, had spoken no word to comfort her, but had\nmade things look worse for her than they were. Why should she submit\nto be questioned by Lord George? In a day or two the secret which he\nknew would be no secret. \"Never mind what he said, Lord George,\" she\nreplied.\n\n\"Has he found it all out?\"\n\n\"You had better go and ask himself,\" said Lizzie. \"I am sick of the\nsubject, and I mean to have done with it.\"\n\nLord George laughed, and Lizzie hated him for his laugh.\n\n\"I declare,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle, \"that you two who were such friends\nare always snapping at each other now.\"\n\n\"The fickleness is all on her ladyship's part,--not on mine,\" said\nLord George; whereupon Lady Eustace walked out of the room and was\nnot seen again till dinner-time.\n\nSoon afterwards Lucinda also endeavoured to escape, but to this Sir\nGriffin objected. Sir Griffin was in a very good humour, and bore\nhimself like a prosperous bridegroom. \"Come, Luce,\" he said, \"get off\nyour high horse for a little. To-morrow, you know, you must come down\naltogether.\"\n\n\"So much the more reason for my remaining up to-day.\"\n\n\"I'll be shot if you shall,\" said Sir Griffin. \"Luce, sit in my lap,\nand give me a kiss.\"\n\nAt this moment Lord George and Mrs. Carbuncle were in the front\ndrawing-room, and Lord George was telling her the true story as to\nthe necklace. It must be explained on his behalf that in doing this\nhe did not consider that he was betraying the trust reposed in him.\n\"They know all about it in Scotland Yard,\" he said; \"I got it from\nGager. They were bound to tell me, as up to this week past every\nman in the police thought that I had been the master-mind among the\nthieves. When I think of it I hardly know whether to laugh or cry.\"\n\n\"And she had them all the time?\" exclaimed Mrs. Carbuncle.\n\n\"Yes;--in this house! Did you ever hear of such a little cat? I could\ntell you more than that. She wanted me to take them and dispose of\nthem.\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"She did though;--and now see the way she treats me! Never mind.\nDon't say a word to her about it till it comes out of itself. She'll\nhave to be arrested, no doubt.\"\n\n\"Arrested!\" Mrs. Carbuncle's further exclamations were stopped by\nLucinda's struggles in the other room. She had declined to sit upon\nthe bridegroom's lap, but had acknowledged that she was bound to\nsubmit to be kissed. He had kissed her, and then had striven to drag\nher on to his knee. But she was strong, and had resisted violently,\nand, as he afterwards said, had struck him savagely. \"Of course I\nstruck him,\" said Lucinda.\n\n\"By ----, you shall pay for it!\" said Sir Griffin. This took place in\nthe presence of Lord George and Mrs. Carbuncle, and yet they were to\nbe married to-morrow.\n\n\"The idea of complaining that a girl hit you,--and the girl who is to\nbe your wife!\" said Lord George, as they walked off together.\n\n\"I know what to complain of, and what not,\" said Sir Griffin. \"Are\nyou going to let me have that money?\"\n\n\"No;--I am not,\" said Lord George,--\"so there's an end of that.\"\nNevertheless, they dined together at their club afterwards, and in\nthe evening Sir Griffin was again in Hertford Street.\n\nThis happened on the Sunday, on which day none of the ladies had gone\nto church. Mr. Emilius well understood the cause of their absence,\nand felt nothing of a parson's anger at it. He was to marry the\ncouple on the Monday morning, and dined with the ladies on the\nSunday. He was peculiarly gracious and smiling, and spoke of the\nHymeneals as though they were even more than ordinarily joyful and\nhappy in their promise. To Lizzie he was almost affectionate, and\nMrs. Carbuncle he flattered to the top of her bent. The power of the\nman in being sprightly under such a load of trouble as oppressed the\nhousehold, was wonderful. He had to do with three women who were\nworldly, hard, and given entirely to evil things. Even as regarded\nthe bride, who felt the horror of her position, so much must be in\ntruth admitted. Though from day to day and hour to hour she would\nopenly declare her hatred of the things around her,--yet she went on.\nSince she had entered upon life she had known nothing but falsehood\nand scheming wickedness;--and, though she rebelled against the\nconsequences, she had not rebelled against the wickedness. Now to\nthis unfortunate young woman and her two companions, Mr. Emilius\ndiscoursed with an unctuous mixture of celestial and terrestrial\nglorification, which was proof, at any rate, of great ability on his\npart. He told them how a good wife was a crown, or rather a chaplet\nof aetherial roses to her husband, and how high rank and great\nstation in the world made such a chaplet more beautiful and more\nvaluable. His work in the vineyard, he said, had fallen lately among\nthe wealthy and nobly born; and though he would not say that he was\nentitled to take glory on that account, still he gave thanks daily in\nthat he had been enabled to give his humble assistance towards the\nrunning of a godly life to those who, by their example, were enabled\nto have so wide an effect upon their poorer fellow-creatures. He\nknew well how difficult it was for a camel to go through the eye\nof a needle. They had the highest possible authority for that. But\nScripture never said that the camel,--which, as he explained it, was\nsimply a thread larger than ordinary thread,--could not go through\nthe needle's eye. The camel which succeeded, in spite of the\ndifficulties attending its exalted position, would be peculiarly\nblessed. And he went on to suggest that the three ladies before him,\none of whom was about to enter upon a new phase of life to-morrow,\nunder auspices peculiarly propitious, were, all of them, camels of\nthis description. Sir Griffin, when he came in, received for a while\nthe peculiar attention of Mr. Emilius. \"I think, Sir Griffin,\" he\ncommenced, \"that no period of a man's life is so blessed, as that\nupon which you will enter to-morrow.\" This he said in a whisper, but\nit was a whisper audible to the ladies.\n\n\"Well;--yes; it's all right, I daresay,\" said Sir Griffin.\n\n\"Well, after all, what is life till a man has met and obtained the\npartner of his soul? It is a blank,--and the blank becomes every day\nmore and more intolerable to the miserable solitary.\"\n\n\"I wonder you don't get married yourself,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle, who\nperceived that Sir Griffin was rather astray for an answer.\n\n\"Ah!--if one could always be fortunate when one loved!\" said Mr.\nEmilius, casting his eyes across to Lizzie Eustace. It was evident to\nthem all that he did not wish to conceal his passion.\n\nIt was the object of Mrs. Carbuncle that the lovers should not be\nleft alone together, but that they should be made to think that they\nwere passing the evening in affectionate intercourse. Lucinda hardly\nspoke, hardly had spoken since her disagreeable struggle with Sir\nGriffin. He said but little, but with Mrs. Carbuncle was better\nhumoured than usual. Every now and then she made little whispered\ncommunications to him, telling that they would be sure to be at the\nchurch at eleven to the moment, explaining to him what would be the\nextent of Lucinda's boxes for the wedding tour, and assuring him that\nhe would find Lucinda's new maid a treasure in regard to his own\nshirts and pocket-handkerchiefs. She toiled marvellously at little\nsubjects, always making some allusion to Lucinda, and never hinting\nthat aught short of Elysium was in store for him. The labour was\ngreat; the task was terrible; but now it was so nearly over! And to\nLizzie she was very courteous, never hinting by a word or a look that\nthere was any new trouble impending on the score of the diamonds.\nShe, too, as she received the greasy compliments of Mr. Emilius with\npretty smiles, had her mind full enough of care.\n\nAt last Sir Griffin went, again kissing his bride as he left. Lucinda\naccepted his embrace without a word and almost without a shudder.\n\"Eleven to the moment, Sir Griffin,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle, with her\nbest good humour. \"All right,\" said Sir Griffin as he passed out of\nthe door. Lucinda walked across the room, and kept her eyes fixed on\nhis retreating figure as he descended the stairs. Mr. Emilius had\nalready departed, with many promises of punctuality, and Lizzie\nnow withdrew for the night. \"Dear Lizzie, good night,\" said Mrs.\nCarbuncle, kissing her.\n\n\"Good night, Lady Eustace,\" said Lucinda. \"I suppose I shall see you\nto-morrow?\"\n\n\"See me!--of course you will see me. I shall come into your room with\nthe girls, after you have had your tea.\" The girls mentioned were\nthe four bridesmaids, as to whom there had been some difficulty,\nas Lucinda had neither sister nor cousins, and had contracted no\npeculiarly tender friendships. But Mrs. Carbuncle had arranged it,\nand four properly-equipped young ladies were to be in attendance at\nten on the morrow.\n\nThen Lucinda and Mrs. Carbuncle were alone. \"Of one thing I feel\nsure,\" said Lucinda in a low voice.\n\n\"What is that, dear?\"\n\n\"I shall never see Sir Griffin Tewett again.\"\n\n\"You talk in that way on purpose to break me down at the last\nmoment,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle.\n\n\"Dear Aunt Jane, I would not break you down if I could help it. I\nhave struggled so hard,--simply that you might be freed from me.\nWe have been very foolish, both of us; but I would bear all the\npunishment,--if I could.\"\n\n\"You know that this is nonsense now.\"\n\n\"Very well. I only tell you. I know that I shall never see him again.\nI will never trust myself alone in his presence. I could not do it.\nWhen he touches me my whole body is in agony. To be kissed by him is\nmadness.\"\n\n\"Lucinda, this is very wicked. You are working yourself up to a\nparoxysm of folly.\"\n\n\"Wicked;--yes, I know that I am wicked. There has been enough of\nwickedness certainly. You don't suppose that I mean to excuse\nmyself?\"\n\n\"Of course you will marry Sir Griffin to-morrow.\"\n\n\"I shall never be married to him. How I shall escape from him,--by\ndying, or going mad,--or by destroying him, God only knows.\" Then she\npaused, and her aunt looking into her face almost began to fear that\nshe was in earnest. But she would not take it as at all indicating\nany real result for the morrow. The girl had often said nearly the\nsame thing before, and had still submitted. \"Do you know, Aunt Jane,\nI don't think I could feel to any man as though I loved him. But for\nthis man,-- Oh God, how I do detest him! I cannot do it.\"\n\n\"You had better go to bed, Lucinda, and let me come to you in the\nmorning.\"\n\n\"Yes;--come to me in the morning;--early.\"\n\n\"I will,--at eight.\"\n\n\"I shall know then, perhaps.\"\n\n\"My dear, will you come to my room to-night, and sleep with me?\"\n\n\"Oh, no. I have ever so many things to do. I have papers to burn,\nand things to put away. But come to me at eight. Good night, Aunt\nJane.\" Mrs. Carbuncle went up to her room with her, kissed her\naffectionately, and then left her.\n\nShe was now really frightened. What would be said of her if she\nshould press the marriage forward to a completion, and if after\nthat some terrible tragedy should take place between the bride and\nbridegroom? That Lucinda, in spite of all that had been said, would\nstand at the altar, and allow the ceremony to be performed, she still\nbelieved. Those last words about burning papers and putting things\naway, seemed to imply that the girl still thought that she would\nbe taken away from her present home on the morrow. But what would\ncome afterwards? The horror which the bride expressed was, as Mrs.\nCarbuncle well knew, no mock feeling, no pretence at antipathy. She\ntried to think of it, and to realise what might in truth be the\ngirl's action and ultimate fate when she should find herself in the\npower of this man whom she so hated. But had not other girls done the\nsame thing, and lived through it all, and become fat, indifferent,\nand fond of the world? It is only the first step that signifies.\n\nAt any rate, the thing must go on now;--must go on, whatever might\nbe the result to Lucinda or to Mrs. Carbuncle herself. Yes; it must\ngo on. There was, no doubt, very much of bitterness in the world\nfor such as them,--for persons doomed by the necessities of their\nposition to a continual struggle. It always had been so, and always\nwould be so. But each bitter cup must be drained in the hope that the\nnext might be sweeter. Of course the marriage must go on; though,\ndoubtless, this cup was very bitter.\n\nMore than once in the night Mrs. Carbuncle crept up to the door\nof her niece's room, endeavouring to ascertain what might be going\non within. At two o'clock, while she was on the landing-place,\nthe candle was extinguished, and she could hear that Lucinda put\nherself to bed. At any rate, so far, things were safe. An indistinct,\nincompleted idea of some possible tragedy had flitted across the mind\nof the poor woman, causing her to shake and tremble, forbidding her,\nweary as she was, to lie down;--but now she told herself at last that\nthis was an idle phantasy, and she went to bed. Of course Lucinda\nmust go through with it. It had been her own doing, and Sir Griffin\nwas not worse than other men. As she said this to herself, Mrs.\nCarbuncle hardened her heart by remembering that her own married life\nhad not been peculiarly happy.\n\nExactly at eight on the following morning she knocked at her niece's\ndoor, and was at once bidden to enter. \"Come in, Aunt Jane.\" The\nwords cheered her wonderfully. At any rate, there had been no tragedy\nas yet, and as she turned the handle of the door, she felt that, as\na matter of course, the marriage would go on just like any other\nmarriage. She found Lucinda up and dressed,--but so dressed as\ncertainly to show no preparation for a wedding-toilet. She had on an\nordinary stuff morning frock, and her hair was close tucked up and\npinned, as it might have been had she already prepared herself for a\njourney. But what astonished Mrs. Carbuncle more than the dress was\nthe girl's manner. She was sitting at a table with a book before her,\nwhich was afterwards found to be the Bible, and she never turned her\nhead as her aunt entered the room. \"What, up already,\" said Mrs.\nCarbuncle,--\"and dressed?\"\n\n\"Yes; I am up,--and dressed. I have been up ever so long. How was I\nto lie in bed on such a morning as this? Aunt Jane, I wish you to\nknow as soon as possible that no earthly consideration will induce me\nto leave this room to-day.\"\n\n\"What nonsense, Lucinda!\"\n\n\"Very well;--all the same you might as well believe me. I want you\nto send to Mr. Emilius, and to those girls,--and to the man. And you\nhad better get Lord George to let the other people know. I'm quite in\nearnest.\"\n\nAnd she was in earnest,--quite in earnest, though there was a\nflightiness about her manner which induced Mrs. Carbuncle for awhile\nto think that she was less so than she had been on the previous\nevening. The unfortunate woman remained with her niece for an hour\nand a half, imploring, threatening, scolding, and weeping. When the\nmaids came to the door, first one maid and then another, they were\nrefused entrance. It might still be possible, Mrs. Carbuncle thought,\nthat she would prevail. But nothing now could shake Lucinda or induce\nher even to discuss the subject. She sat there looking steadfastly at\nthe book,--hardly answering, never defending herself, but protesting\nthat nothing should induce her to leave the room on that day. \"Do you\nwant to destroy me?\" Mrs. Carbuncle said at last.\n\n\"You have destroyed me,\" said Lucinda.\n\nAt half-past nine Lizzie Eustace came to the room, and Mrs.\nCarbuncle, in her trouble, thought it better to take other counsel.\nLizzie, therefore, was admitted. \"Is anything wrong?\" asked Lizzie.\n\n\"Everything is wrong,\" said the aunt. \"She says that--she won't be\nmarried.\"\n\n\"Oh, Lucinda!\"\n\n\"Pray speak to her, Lady Eustace. You see it is getting so late, and\nshe ought to be nearly dressed now. Of course she must allow herself\nto be dressed.\"\n\n\"I am dressed,\" said Lucinda.\n\n\"But, dear Lucinda,--everybody will be waiting for you,\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"Let them wait,--till they're tired. If Aunt Jane doesn't choose to\nsend, it is not my fault. I sha'n't go out of this room to-day unless\nI am carried out. Do you want to hear that I have murdered the man?\"\n\nThey brought her tea, and endeavoured to induce her to eat and drink.\nShe would take the tea, she said, if they would promise to send to\nput the people off. Mrs. Carbuncle so far gave way as to undertake to\ndo so, if she would name the next day or the day following for the\nwedding. But on hearing this she arose almost in a majesty of wrath.\nNeither on this day, or on the next, or on any following day, would\nshe yield herself to the wretch whom they had endeavoured to force\nupon her. \"She must do it, you know,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle, turning to\nLizzie. \"You'll see if I must,\" said Lucinda, sitting square at the\ntable, with her eyes firmly fixed upon the book.\n\nThen came up the servant to say that the four bridesmaids were\nall assembled in the drawing-room. When she heard this, even Mrs.\nCarbuncle gave way, and threw herself upon the bed and wept. \"Oh,\nLady Eustace, what are we to do? Lucinda, you have destroyed me. You\nhave destroyed me altogether, after all that I have done for you.\"\n\n\"And what has been done to me, do you think?\" said Lucinda.\n\nSomething must be settled. All the servants in the house by this time\nknew that there would be no wedding, and no doubt some tidings as to\nthe misadventure of the day had already reached the four ladies in\nthe drawing-room. \"What am I to do?\" said Mrs. Carbuncle, starting up\nfrom the bed.\n\n\"I really think you had better send to Mr. Emilius,\" said\nLizzie;--\"and to Lord George.\"\n\n\"What am I to say? Who is there to go? Oh,--I wish that somebody\nwould kill me this minute! Lady Eustace, would you mind going down\nand telling those ladies to go away?\"\n\n\"And had I not better send Richard to the church?\"\n\n\"Oh yes;--send anybody everywhere. I don't know what to do. Oh,\nLucinda, this is the unkindest and the wickedest, and the most\nhorrible thing that anybody ever did! I shall never, never be able\nto hold up my head again.\" Mrs. Carbuncle was completely prostrate,\nbut Lucinda sat square at the table, firm as a rock, saying nothing,\nmaking no excuse for herself, with her eyes fixed upon the Bible.\n\nLady Eustace carried her message to the astonished and indignant\nbridesmaids, and succeeded in sending them back to their respective\nhomes. Richard, glorious in new livery, forgetting that his flowers\nwere still on his breast,--ready dressed to attend the bride's\ncarriage,--went with his sad message, first to the church and then\nto the banqueting-hall in Albemarle Street.\n\n\"Not any wedding?\" said the head-waiter at the hotel. \"I knew they\nwas folks as would have a screw loose somewheres. There's lots to\nstand for the bill, anyways,\" he added, as he remembered all the\ntribute.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXX\n\nAlas!\n\n\nNo attempt was made to send other messages from Hertford Street than\nthose which were taken to the church and to the hotel. Sir Griffin\nand Lord George went together to the church in a brougham, and, on\nthe way, the best man rather ridiculed the change in life which he\nsupposed that his friend was about to make. \"I don't in the least\nknow how you mean to get along,\" said Lord George.\n\n\"Much as other men do, I suppose.\"\n\n\"But you're always sparring, already.\"\n\n\"It's that old woman that you're so fond of,\" said Sir Griffin. \"I\ndon't mean to have any ill-humour from my wife, I can tell you. I\nknow who will have the worst of it if there is.\"\n\n\"Upon my word, I think you'll have your hands full,\" said Lord\nGeorge. They got out at a sort of private door attached to the\nchapel, and were there received by the clerk, who wore a very long\nface. The news had already come, and had been communicated to Mr.\nEmilius, who was in the vestry. \"Are the ladies here yet?\" asked\nLord George. The woebegone clerk told them that the ladies were not\nyet there, and suggested that they should see Mr. Emilius. Into the\npresence of Mr. Emilius they were led, and then they heard the truth.\n\n\"Sir Griffin,\" said Mr. Emilius, holding the baronet by the hand,\n\"I'm sorry to have to tell you that there's something wrong in\nHertford Street.\"\n\n\"What's wrong?\" asked Sir Griffin.\n\n\"You don't mean to say that Miss Roanoke is not to be here?\" demanded\nLord George. \"By George, I thought as much. I did indeed.\"\n\n\"I can only tell you what I know, Lord George. Mrs. Carbuncle's\nservant was here ten minutes since, Sir Griffin,--before I came down,\nand he told the clerk that--that--\"\n\n\"What the d---- did he tell him?\" asked Sir Griffin.\n\n\"He said that Miss Roanoke had changed her mind, and didn't mean to\nbe married at all. That's all that I can learn from what he says.\nPerhaps you will think it best to go up to Hertford Street?\"\n\n\"I'll be ---- if I do,\" said Sir Griffin.\n\n\"I am not in the least surprised,\" repeated Lord George. \"Tewett, my\nboy, we might as well go home to lunch, and the sooner you're out of\ntown the better.\"\n\n\"I knew that I should be taken in at last by that accursed woman,\"\nsaid Sir Griffin.\n\n\"It wasn't Mrs. Carbuncle, if you mean that. She'd have given her\nleft hand to have had it completed. I rather think you've had an\nescape, Griff; and if I were you, I'd make the best of it.\" Sir\nGriffin spoke not another word, but left the church with his friend\nin the brougham that had brought them, and so he disappears from our\nstory. Mr. Emilius looked after him with wistful eyes, regretful for\nhis fee. Had the baronet been less coarse and violent in his language\nhe would have asked for it; but he feared that he might be cursed\nin his own church, before his clerk, and abstained. Late in the\nafternoon Lord George, when he had administered comfort to the\ndisappointed bridegroom in the shape of a hot lunch, Cura\u00c3\u00a7oa,\nand cigars, walked up to Hertford Street, calling at the hotel\nin Albemarle Street on the way. The waiter told him all that he\nknew. Some thirty or forty guests had come to the wedding-banquet,\nand had all been sent away with tidings that the marriage had\nbeen--postponed. \"You might have told 'em a trifle more than that,\"\nsaid Lord George. \"Postponed was pleasantest, my lord,\" said the\nwaiter. \"Anyways, that was said, and we supposes, my lord, as the\nthings ain't wanted now.\" Lord George replied that, as far as he\nknew, the things were not wanted, and then continued his way up to\nHertford Street.\n\nAt first he saw Lizzie Eustace, upon whom the misfortune of the\nday had had a most depressing effect. The wedding was to have been\nthe one morsel of pleasing excitement which would come before she\nunderwent the humble penance to which she was doomed. That was\nfrustrated and abandoned, and now she could think only of Mr.\nCamperdown, her cousin Frank, and Lady Glencora Palliser. \"What's\nup now?\" said Lord George, with that disrespect which had always\naccompanied his treatment of her since she had told him her secret.\n\"What's the meaning of all this?\"\n\n\"I daresay that you know as well as I do, my lord.\"\n\n\"I must know a good deal if I do. It seems that among you there is\nnothing but one trick upon another.\"\n\n\"I suppose you are speaking of your own friends, Lord George. You\ndoubtless know much more than I do of Miss Roanoke's affairs.\"\n\n\"Does she mean to say that she doesn't mean to marry the man at all?\"\n\n\"So I understand;--but really you had better send for Mrs.\nCarbuncle.\"\n\nHe did send for Mrs. Carbuncle, and after some words with her, was\ntaken up into Lucinda's room. There sat the unfortunate girl, in the\nchair from which she had not moved since the morning. There had come\nover her face a look of fixed but almost idiotic resolution; her\nmouth was compressed, and her eyes were glazed, and she sat twiddling\nher book before her with her fingers. She had eaten nothing since she\nhad got up, and had long ceased to be violent when questioned by her\naunt. But, nevertheless, she was firm enough when her aunt begged to\nbe allowed to write a letter to Sir Griffin, explaining that all this\nhad arisen from temporary indisposition. \"No; it isn't temporary. It\nisn't temporary at all. You can write to him; but I'll never come out\nof this room if I am told that I am to see him.\"\n\n\"What is all this about, Lucinda?\" said Lord George, speaking in his\nkindest voice.\n\n\"Is he there?\" said she, turning round suddenly.\n\n\"Sir Griffin?--no indeed. He has left town.\"\n\n\"You're sure he's not there? It's no good his coming. If he comes for\never and ever he shall never touch me again;--not alive; he shall\nnever touch me again alive.\" As she spoke she moved across the room\nto the fire-place and grasped the poker in her hand.\n\n\"Has she been like that all the morning?\" whispered Lord George.\n\n\"No;--not like. She has been quite quiet. Lucinda!\"\n\n\"Don't let him come here, then; that's all. What's the use? They\ncan't make me marry him. And I won't marry him. Everybody has known\nthat I hated him,--detested him. Oh, Lord George, it has been very,\nvery cruel.\"\n\n\"Has it been my fault, Lucinda?\"\n\n\"She wouldn't have done it if you had told her not. But you won't\nbring him again;--will you?\"\n\n\"Certainly not. He means to go abroad.\"\n\n\"Ah,--yes; that will be best. Let him go abroad. He knew it all the\ntime,--that I hated him. Why did he want me to be his wife? If he has\ngone abroad, I will go down-stairs. But I won't go out of the house.\nNothing shall make me go out of the house. Are the bridesmaids gone?\"\n\n\"Long ago,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle, piteously.\n\n\"Then I will go down.\" And, between them, they led her into the\ndrawing-room.\n\n\"It is my belief,\" said Lord George to Mrs. Carbuncle, some minutes\nafterwards, \"that you have driven her mad.\"\n\n\"Are you going to turn against me?\"\n\n\"It is true. How you have had the heart to go on pressing it upon\nher, I could never understand. I am about as hard as a milestone, but\nI'll be shot if I could have done it. From day to day I thought that\nyou would have given way.\"\n\n\"That is so like a man,--when it is all over, to turn upon a woman\nand say that she did it.\"\n\n\"Didn't you do it? I thought you did, and that you took a great deal\nof pride in the doing of it. When you made him offer to her down in\nScotland, and made her accept him, you were so proud that you could\nhardly hold yourself. What will you do now? Go on just as though\nnothing had happened?\"\n\n\"I don't know what we shall do. There will be so many things to be\npaid.\"\n\n\"I should think there would,--and you can hardly expect Sir Griffin\nto pay for them. You'll have to take her away somewhere. You'll find\nthat she can't remain here. And that other woman will be in prison\nbefore the week's over, I should say,--unless she runs away.\"\n\nThere was not much of comfort to be obtained by any of them from\nLord George, who was quite as harsh to Mrs. Carbuncle as he had been\nto Lizzie Eustace. He remained in Hertford Street for an hour, and\nthen took his leave, saying that he thought that he also should go\nabroad. \"I didn't think,\" he said, \"that anything could have hurt my\ncharacter much; but, upon my word, between you and Lady Eustace, I\nbegin to find that in every deep there may be a lower depth. All the\ntown has given me credit for stealing her ladyship's necklace, and\nnow I shall be mixed up in this mock marriage. I shouldn't wonder if\nRooper were to send his bill in to me,\"--Mr. Rooper was the keeper of\nthe hotel in Albemarle Street,--\"I think I shall follow Sir Griffin\nabroad. You have made England too hot to hold me.\" And so he left\nthem.\n\nThe evening of that day was a terrible time to the three ladies in\nHertford Street,--and the following day was almost worse. Nobody came\nto see them, and not one of them dared to speak of the future. For\nthe third day, the Wednesday, Lady Eustace had made her appointment\nwith Mr. Camperdown, having written to the attorney, in compliance\nwith the pressing advice of Major Mackintosh, to name an hour. Mr.\nCamperdown had written again, sending his compliments, and saying\nthat he would receive Lady Eustace at the time fixed by her. The\nprospect of this interview was very bad, but even this was hardly so\noppressive as the actual existing wretchedness of that house. Mrs.\nCarbuncle, whom Lizzie had always known as high-spirited, bold, and\nalmost domineering, was altogether prostrated by her misfortunes. She\nwas querulous, lachrymose, and utterly despondent. From what Lizzie\nnow learned, her hostess was enveloped in a mass of debt which would\nhave been hopeless, even had Lucinda gone off as a bride; but she had\nbeen willing to face all that with the object of establishing her\nniece. She could have expected nothing from the marriage for herself.\nShe well knew that Sir Griffin would neither pay her debts nor give\nher a home nor lend her money. But to have married the girl who was\nin her charge would have been in itself a success, and would have in\nsome sort repaid her for her trouble. There would have been something\nleft to show for her expenditure of time and money. But now there was\nnothing around her but failure and dismay. The very servants in the\nhouse seemed to know that ordinary respect was hardly demanded from\nthem.\n\nAs to Lucinda, Lizzie felt, from the very hour in which she first saw\nher on the morning of the intended wedding, that her mind was astray.\nShe insisted on passing the time up in her own room, and always sat\nwith the Bible before her. At every knock at the door, or ring at\nthe bell, she would look round suspiciously, and once she whispered\ninto Lizzie's ear that if ever \"he\" should come there again she\nwould \"give him a kiss with a vengeance.\" On the Tuesday, Lizzie\nrecommended Mrs. Carbuncle to get medical advice,--and at last they\nsent for Mr. Emilius that they might ask counsel of him. Mr. Emilius\nwas full of smiles and consolation, and still allowed his golden\nhopes as to some Elysian future to crop out;--but he did acknowledge\nat last, in a whispered conference with Lady Eustace, that somebody\nought to see Miss Roanoke. Somebody did see Miss Roanoke,--and the\ndoctor who was thus appealed to shook his head. Perhaps Miss Roanoke\nhad better be taken into the country for a little while.\n\n\"Dear Lady Eustace,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle, \"now you can be a friend\nindeed,\"--meaning, of course, that an invitation to Portray Castle\nwould do more than could anything else towards making straight\nthe crooked things of the hour. Mrs. Carbuncle, when she made the\nrequest, of course knew of Lizzie's coming troubles;--but let them\ndo what they could to Lizzie, they could not take away her house.\n\nBut Lizzie felt at once that this would not suit. \"Ah, Mrs.\nCarbuncle,\" she said. \"You do not know the condition which I am in\nmyself!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXI\n\nLizzie Is Threatened with the Treadmill\n\n\nEarly on the Wednesday morning, two or three hours before the time\nfixed for Lizzie's visit to Mr. Camperdown, her cousin Frank came to\ncall upon her. She presumed him to be altogether ignorant of all that\nMajor Mackintosh had known, and therefore endeavoured to receive him\nas though her heart were light.\n\n\"Oh, Frank,\" she said, \"you have heard of our terrible misfortune\nhere?\"\n\n\"I have heard so much,\" said he gravely, \"that I hardly know what to\nbelieve and what not to believe.\"\n\n\"I mean about Miss Roanoke's marriage?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes;--I have been told that it is broken off.\"\n\nThen Lizzie, with affected eagerness, gave him a description of the\nwhole affair, declaring how horrible, how tragic, the thing had been\nfrom its very commencement. \"Don't you remember, Frank, down at\nPortray, they never really cared for each other? They became engaged\nthe very time you were there.\"\n\n\"I have not forgotten it.\"\n\n\"The truth is, Lucinda Roanoke did not understand what real love\nmeans. She had never taught herself to comprehend what is the very\nessence of love;--and as for Sir Griffin Tewett, though he was\nanxious to marry her, he never had any idea of love at all. Did not\nyou always feel that, Frank?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry you have had so much to do with them, Lizzie.\"\n\n\"There's no help for spilt milk, Frank; and, as for that, I don't\nsuppose that Mrs. Carbuncle can do me any harm. The man is a baronet,\nand the marriage would have been respectable. Miss Roanoke has been\neccentric, and that has been the long and the short of it. What will\nbe done, Frank, with all the presents that were bought?\"\n\n\"I haven't an idea. They'd better be sold to pay the bills. But I\ncame to you, Lizzie, about another piece of business.\"\n\n\"What piece of business?\" she asked, looking him in the face for a\nmoment, trying to be bold, but trembling as she did so. She had\nbelieved him to be ignorant of her story, but she had soon perceived,\nfrom his manner to her, that he knew it all,--or, at least, that he\nknew so much that she would have to tell him all the rest. There\ncould be no longer any secret with him. Indeed there could be no\nlonger any secret with anybody. She must be prepared to encounter a\nworld accurately informed as to every detail of the business which,\nfor the last three months, had been to her a burden so oppressive\nthat, at some periods, she had sunk altogether under the weight. She\nhad already endeavoured to realise her position, and to make clear to\nherself the condition of her future life. Lord George had talked to\nher of perjury and prison, and had tried to frighten her by making\nthe very worst of her faults. According to him she would certainly\nbe made to pay for the diamonds, and would be enabled to do so by\nsaving her income during a long term of incarceration. This was a\nterrible prospect of things;--and she had almost believed in it. Then\nthe major had come to her. The major, she thought, was the truest\ngentleman she had ever seen, and her best friend. Ah;--if it had not\nbeen for the wife and seven children, there might still have been\ncomfort! That which had been perjury with Lord George, had by the\nmajor been so simply, and yet so correctly, called an incorrect\nversion of facts! And so it was,--and no more than that. Lizzie, in\ndefending herself to herself, felt that, though cruel magistrates and\nhard-hearted lawyers and pig-headed jurymen might call her little\nfault by the name of perjury, it could not be real, wicked perjury,\nbecause the diamonds had been her own. She had defrauded nobody,--had\nwished to defraud nobody,--if only the people would have left her\nalone. It had suited her to give--an incorrect version of facts,\nbecause people had troubled themselves about her affairs; and now all\nthis had come upon her! The major had comforted her very greatly; but\nstill,--what would the world say? Even he, kind and comfortable as\nhe had been, had made her understand that she must go into court and\nconfess the incorrectness of her own version. She believed every word\nthe major said. Ah, there was a man worthy to be believed;--a man of\nmen! They could not take away her income or her castle. They could\nnot make her pay for the diamonds. But still,--what would the world\nsay? And what would her lovers say? What one of her lovers thought\nproper to say, she had already heard. Lord George had spoken out,\nand had made himself very disagreeable. Lord Fawn, she knew, would\nwithdraw the renewal of his offer, let her answer to him be what it\nmight. But what would Frank say? And now Frank was with her, looking\ninto her face with severe eyes.\n\nShe was more than ever convinced that the life of a widow was not\nsuited for her, and that, among her several lovers, she must settle\nher wealth and her heart upon some special lover. Neither her wealth\nnor her heart would be in any way injured by the confession which she\nwas prepared to make. But then men are so timid, so false, and so\nblind! In regard to Frank, whom she now believed that she had loved\nwith all the warmth of her young affections from the first moment\nin which she had seen him after Sir Florian's death,--she had been\nat great trouble to clear the way for him. She knew of his silly\nengagement to Lucy Morris, and was willing to forgive him that\noffence. She knew that he could not marry Lucy, because of her\npennilessness and his indebtedness; and therefore she had taken the\ntrouble to see Lucy with the view of making things straight on that\nside. Lucy had, of course, been rough with her, and ill-mannered,\nbut Lizzie thought that, upon the whole, she had succeeded. Lucy was\nrough and ill-mannered, but was, at the same time, what the world\ncalls good, and would hardly persevere after what had been said to\nher. Lizzie was sure that, a month since, her cousin would have\nyielded himself to her willingly, if he could only have freed himself\nfrom Lucy Morris. But now, just in this very nick of time, which was\nso momentous to her, the police had succeeded in unravelling her\nsecret, and there sat Frank, looking at her with stern, ill-natured\neyes, like an enemy rather than a lover.\n\n\"What piece of business?\" she asked, in answer to his question. She\nmust be bold,--if she could. She must brazen it out with him, if only\nshe could be strong enough to put on her brass in his presence. He\nhad been so stupidly chivalrous in believing all her stories about\nthe robbery when nobody else had quite believed them, that she felt\nthat she had before her a task that was very disagreeable and very\ndifficult. She looked up at him, struggling to be bold, and then her\nglance sank before his gaze and fell upon the floor.\n\n\"I do not at all wish to pry into your secrets,\" he said.\n\nSecrets from him! Some such exclamation was on her lips, when she\nremembered that her special business, at the present moment, was to\nacknowledge a secret which had been kept from him. \"It is unkind of\nyou to speak to me in that way,\" she said.\n\n\"I am quite in earnest. I do not wish to pry into your secrets. But I\nhear rumours which seem to be substantiated; and though, of course, I\ncould stay away from you--\"\n\n\"Oh,--whatever happens, pray, pray do not stay away from me. Where am\nI to look for advice if you stay away from me?\"\n\n\"That is all very well, Lizzie.\"\n\n\"Ah, Frank! if you desert me, I am undone.\"\n\n\"It is, of course, true that some of the police have been with you\nlately?\"\n\n\"Major Mackintosh was here, about the end of last week,--a most kind\nman, altogether a gentleman, and I was so glad to see him.\"\n\n\"What made him come?\"\n\n\"What made him come?\" How should she tell her story? \"Oh, he came,\nof course, about the robbery. They have found out everything. It was\nthe jeweller, Benjamin, who concocted it all. That horrid sly girl I\nhad, Patience Crabstick, put him up to it. And there were two regular\nhousebreakers. They have found it all out at last.\"\n\n\"So I hear.\"\n\n\"And Major Mackintosh came to tell me about it.\"\n\n\"But the diamonds are gone?\"\n\n\"Oh yes;--those weary, weary diamonds. Do you know, Frank, that,\nthough they were my own, as much as the coat you wear is your own, I\nam glad they are gone. I am glad that the police have not found them.\nThey tormented me so that I hated them. Don't you remember that I\ntold you how I longed to throw them into the sea, and to be rid of\nthem for ever?\"\n\n\"That, of course, was a joke.\"\n\n\"It was no joke, Frank. It was solemn, serious truth.\"\n\n\"What I want to know is,--where were they stolen?\"\n\nThat, of course, was the question which hitherto Lizzie Eustace had\nanswered by an incorrect version of facts, and now she must give the\ntrue version. She tried to put a bold face upon it, but it was very\ndifficult. A face bold with brass she could not assume. Perhaps a\nlittle bit of acting might serve her turn, and a face that should be\ntender rather than bold. \"Oh, Frank!\" she exclaimed, bursting out\ninto tears.\n\n\"I always supposed that they were taken at Carlisle,\" said Frank.\nLizzie fell on her knees, at his feet, with her hands clasped\ntogether, and her one long lock of hair hanging down so as to touch\nhis arm. Her eyes were bright with tears, but were not, as yet, wet\nand red with weeping. Was not this confession enough? Was he so\nhard-hearted as to make her tell her own disgrace in spoken words? Of\ncourse he knew, well enough, now, when the diamonds had been stolen.\nIf he were possessed of any tenderness, any tact, any manliness, he\nwould go on, presuming that question to have been answered.\n\n\"I don't quite understand it all,\" he said, laying his hand softly\nupon her shoulder. \"I have been led to make so many statements to\nother people, which now seem to have been--incorrect! It was only the\nbox that was taken at Carlisle?\"\n\n\"Only the box.\" She could answer that question.\n\n\"But the thieves thought that the diamonds were in the box?\"\n\n\"I suppose so. But, oh, Frank! don't cross-question me about it. If\nyou could know what I have suffered, you would not punish me any\nmore. I have got to go to Mr. Camperdown's this very day. I offered\nto do that at once, and I sha'n't have strength to go through it if\nyou are not kind to me now. Dear, dear Frank,--do be kind to me.\"\n\nAnd he was kind to her. He lifted her up to the sofa and did not ask\nher another question about the necklace. Of course she had lied to\nhim and to all the world. From the very commencement of his intimacy\nwith her, he had known that she was a liar, and what else could he\nhave expected but lies? As it happened, this particular lie had been\nvery big, very efficacious, and the cause of boundless troubles. It\nhad been wholly unnecessary, and, from the first, though injurious to\nmany, more injurious to her than to any other. He himself had been\ninjured, but it seemed to him now that she had absolutely ruined\nherself. And all this had been done for nothing,--had been done, as\nhe thought, that Mr. Camperdown might be kept in the dark, whereas\nall the light in the world would have assisted Mr. Camperdown\nnothing. He brought to mind, as he stood over her, all those scenes\nwhich she had so successfully performed in his presence since she had\ncome to London,--scenes in which the robbery in Carlisle had been\ndiscussed between them. She had on these occasions freely expressed\nher opinion about the necklace, saying, in a low whisper, with\na pretty little shrug of her shoulders, that she presumed it to\nbe impossible that Lord George should have been concerned in the\nrobbery. Frank had felt, as she said so, that some suspicion was\nintended by her to be attached to Lord George. She had wondered\nwhether Mr. Camperdown had known anything about it. She had hoped\nthat Lord Fawn would now be satisfied. She had been quite convinced\nthat Mr. Benjamin had the diamonds. She had been indignant that\nthe police had not traced the property. She had asked in another\nwhisper,--a very low whisper indeed,--whether it was possible that\nMrs. Carbuncle should know more about it than she was pleased to\ntell? And all the while the necklace had been lying in her own desk,\nand she had put it there with her own hands!\n\nIt was marvellous to him that the woman could have been so false and\nhave sustained her falsehood so well. And this was his cousin, his\nwell-beloved,--as a cousin, certainly well-beloved; and there had,\ndoubtless, been times in which he had thought that he would make\nher his wife! He could not but smile as he stood looking at her,\ncontemplating all the confusion which she had caused, and thinking\nhow very little the disclosure of her iniquity seemed to confound\nherself. \"Oh, Frank, do not laugh at me,\" she said.\n\n\"I am not laughing, Lizzie; I am only wondering.\"\n\n\"And now, Frank, what had I better do?\"\n\n\"Ah;--that is difficult; is it not? You see I hardly know all the\ntruth yet. I do not want to know more,--but how can I advise you?\"\n\n\"I thought you knew everything.\"\n\n\"I don't suppose anybody can do anything to you.\"\n\n\"Major Mackintosh says that nobody can. He quite understands that\nthey were my own property, and that I had a right to keep them in\nmy desk if I pleased. Why was I to tell everybody where they were?\nOf course I was foolish, and now they are lost. It is I that have\nsuffered. Major Mackintosh quite understands that, and says that\nnobody can do anything to me;--only I must go to Mr. Camperdown.\"\n\n\"You will have to be examined again before a magistrate.\"\n\n\"Yes;--I suppose I must be examined. You will go with me,\nFrank,--won't you?\" He winced, and made no immediate reply. \"I don't\nmean to Mr. Camperdown, but before the magistrate. Will it be in a\ncourt?\"\n\n\"I suppose so.\"\n\n\"The gentleman came here before. Couldn't he come here again?\" Then\nhe explained to her the difference of her present position, and in\ndoing so he did say something of her iniquity. He made her understand\nthat the magistrate had gone out of his way at the last inquiry,\nbelieving her to be a lady who had been grievously wronged, and one,\ntherefore, to whom much consideration was due. \"And I have been\ngrievously wronged,\" said Lizzie. But now she would be required to\ntell the truth in opposition to the false evidence which she had\nformerly given; and she would herself be exempted from prosecution\nfor perjury only on the ground that she would be called on to\ncriminate herself in giving evidence against criminals whose crimes\nhad been deeper than her own. \"I suppose they can't quite eat me,\"\nshe said, smiling through her tears.\n\n\"No;--they won't eat you,\" he replied gravely.\n\n\"And you will go with me?\"\n\n\"Yes;--I suppose I had better do so.\"\n\n\"Ah;--that will be so nice.\" The idea of the scene at the\npolice-court was not at all \"nice\" to Frank Greystock. \"I shall not\nmind what they say to me as long as you are by my side. Everybody\nwill know that they were my own,--won't they?\"\n\n\"And there will be the trial afterwards.\"\n\n\"Another trial?\" Then he explained to her the course of\naffairs,--that the men might not improbably be tried at Carlisle\nfor stealing the box, and again in London for stealing the\ndiamonds,--that two distinct acts of burglary had been committed, and\nthat her evidence would be required on both occasions. He told her\nalso that her attendance before the magistrate on Friday would only\nbe a preliminary ceremony, and that, before the thing was over she\nwould, doubtless, be doomed to bear a great deal of annoyance, and to\nanswer very many disagreeable questions. \"I shall care for nothing if\nyou will only be at my side,\" she exclaimed.\n\nHe was very urgent with her to go to Scotland as soon as her\nexamination before the magistrates should be over, and was much\nastonished at the excuse she made for not doing so. Mrs. Carbuncle\nhad borrowed all her ready money; but as she was now in Mrs.\nCarbuncle's house, she could repay herself a portion of the loan by\nremaining there and eating it out. She did not exactly say how much\nMrs. Carbuncle had borrowed, but she left an impression on Frank's\nmind that it was about ten times the actual sum. With this excuse he\nwas not satisfied, and told her that she must go to Scotland, if only\nfor the sake of escaping from the Carbuncle connexion. She promised\nto obey him if he would be her convoy. The Easter holidays were\njust now at hand, and he could not refuse on the plea of time. \"Oh,\nFrank, do not refuse me this;--only think how terribly forlorn is my\nposition!\" He did not refuse, but he did not quite promise. He was\nstill tender-hearted towards her in spite of her enormities. One\niniquity,--perhaps her worst iniquity, he did not yet know. He had\nnot as yet heard of her disinterested appeal to Lucy Morris.\n\nWhen he left her she was almost joyous for a few minutes;--till\nthe thought of her coming interview with Mr. Camperdown again\novershadowed her. She had dreaded two things chiefly,--her first\ninterview with her cousin Frank after he should have learned the\ntruth, and those perils in regard to perjury with which Lord George\nhad threatened her. Both these bugbears had now vanished. That dear\nman, the major, had told her that there would be no such perils, and\nher cousin Frank had not seemed to think so very much of her lies and\ntreachery! He had still been affectionate with her; he would support\nher before the magistrate, and would travel with her to Scotland. And\nafter that who could tell what might come next? How foolish she had\nbeen to trouble herself as she had done,--almost to choke herself\nwith an agony of fear, because she had feared detection. Now she was\ndetected;--and what had come of it? That great officer of justice,\nMajor Mackintosh, had been almost more than civil to her; and her\ndear cousin Frank was still a cousin,--dear as ever. People, after\nall, did not think so very much of perjury,--of perjury such as hers,\ncommitted in regard to one's own property. It was that odious Lord\nGeorge who had frightened her, instead of comforting, as he would\nhave done had there been a spark of the true Corsair poetry about\nhim. She did not feel comfortably confident as to what might be said\nof her by Lady Glencora and the Duke of Omnium, but she was almost\ninclined to think that Lady Glencora would support her. Lady Glencora\nwas no poor, mealy-mouthed thing, but a woman of the world who\nunderstood what was what. Lizzie no doubt wished that the trials and\nexaminations were over;--but her money was safe. They could not take\naway Portray, nor could they rob her of four thousand a year. As for\nthe rest, she could live it down.\n\nShe had ordered the carriage to take her to Mr. Camperdown's\nchambers, and now she dressed herself for the occasion. He should not\nbe made to think, at any rate by her outside appearance, that she was\nashamed of herself. But before she started she had just a word with\nMrs. Carbuncle. \"I think I shall go down to Scotland on Saturday,\"\nshe said, proclaiming her news not in the most gracious manner.\n\n\"That is if they let you go,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle.\n\n\"What do you mean? Who is to prevent me?\"\n\n\"The police. I know all about it, Lady Eustace, and you need not look\nlike that. Lord George informs me that you will probably--be locked\nup to-day or to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Lord George is a story-teller. I don't believe he ever said so. And\nif he did, he knows nothing about it.\"\n\n\"He ought to know, considering all that you have made him suffer.\nThat you should have gone on, with the necklace in your own box all\nthe time, letting people think that he had taken it, and accepting\nhis attentions all the while, is what I cannot understand! And\nhowever you were able to look those people at Carlisle in the face,\npasses me! Of course, Lady Eustace, you can't stay here after what\nhas occurred.\"\n\n\"I shall stay just as long as I like, Mrs. Carbuncle.\"\n\n\"Poor dear Lucinda! I do not wonder that she should be driven beyond\nherself by so horrible a story. The feeling that she has been living\nall this time in the same house with a woman who had deceived all the\npolice,--all the police,--has been too much for her. I know it has\nbeen almost too much for me.\" And yet, as Lizzie at once understood,\nMrs. Carbuncle knew nothing now which she had not known when she made\nher petition to be taken to Portray. And this was the woman, too, who\nhad borrowed her money last week, whom she had entertained for months\nat Portray, and who had pretended to be her bosom-friend. \"You are\nquite right in getting off to Scotland as soon as possible,--if they\nwill let you go,\" continued Mrs. Carbuncle. \"Of course you could not\nstay here. Up to Friday night it can be permitted; but the servants\nhad better wait upon you in your own rooms.\"\n\n\"How dare you talk to me in that way?\" screamed Lizzie.\n\n\"When a woman has committed perjury,\" said Mrs. Carbuncle, holding\nup both her hands in awe and grief, \"nothing too bad can possibly be\nsaid to her. You are amenable to the outraged laws of the country,\nand it is my belief that they can keep you upon the treadmill and\nbread and water for months and months,--if not for years.\" Having\npronounced this terrible sentence, Mrs. Carbuncle stalked out of the\nroom. \"That they can sequester your property for your creditors, I\nknow,\" she said, returning for a moment and putting her head within\nthe door.\n\nThe carriage was ready, and it was time for Lizzie to start if\nshe intended to keep her appointment with Mr. Camperdown. She was\nmuch flustered and weakened by Mrs. Carbuncle's ill-usage, and had\ndifficulty in restraining herself from tears. And yet what the woman\nhad said was false from beginning to end. The maid, who was the\nsuccessor of Patience Crabstick, was to accompany her; and, as she\npassed through the hall, she so far recovered herself as to be able\nto conceal her dismay from the servants.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXII\n\nLizzie Triumphs\n\n\nReports had, of course, reached Mr. Camperdown of the true story of\nthe Eustace diamonds. He had learned that the Jew jeweller had made a\ndetermined set at them, having in the first place hired housebreakers\nto steal them at Carlisle, and having again hired the same\nhousebreakers to steal them from the house in Hertford Street, as\nsoon as he knew that Lady Eustace had herself secreted them. By\ndegrees this information had reached him,--but not in a manner to\ninduce him to declare himself satisfied with the truth. But now Lady\nEustace was coming to him,--as he presumed, to confess everything.\n\nWhen he first heard that the diamonds had been stolen at Carlisle, he\nwas eager with Mr. Eustace in contending that the widow's liability\nin regard to the property was not at all the less because she had\nmanaged to lose it through her own pig-headed obstinacy. He consulted\nhis trusted friend, Mr. Dove, on the occasion, making out another\ncase for the barrister, and Mr. Dove had opined that, if it could be\nfirst proved that the diamonds were the property of the estate and\nnot of Lady Eustace, and afterwards proved that they had been stolen\nthrough her laches,--then could the Eustace estate recover the value\nfrom her estate. As she had carried the diamonds about with her in an\nabsurd manner, her responsibility might probably be established;--but\nthe non-existence of ownership by her must be first declared by a\nVice-Chancellor,--with probability of appeal to the Lords Justices\nand to the House of Lords. A bill in Chancery must be filed, in the\nfirst place, to have the question of ownership settled; and then,\nshould the estate be at length declared the owner, restitution of the\nproperty which had been lost through the lady's fault must be sought\nat Common Law.\n\nThat had been the opinion of the Turtle Dove, and Mr. Camperdown had\nat once submitted to the law of his great legal mentor. But John\nEustace had positively declared when he heard it that no more money\nshould be thrown away in looking after property which would require\ntwo lawsuits to establish, and which, when established, might not be\nrecovered. \"How can we make her pay ten thousand pounds? She might\ndie first,\" said John Eustace;--and Mr. Camperdown had been forced to\nyield. Then came the second robbery, and gradually there was spread\nabout a report that the diamonds had been in Hertford Street all the\ntime;--that they had not been taken at Carlisle, but certainly had\nbeen stolen at last.\n\nMr. Camperdown was again in a fever, and again had recourse to Mr.\nDove and to John Eustace. He learned from the police all that they\nwould tell him, and now the whole truth was to be divulged to him by\nthe chief culprit herself. For, to the mind of Mr. Camperdown the\ntwo housebreakers, and Patience Crabstick,--and even Mr. Benjamin\nhimself, were white as snow compared with the blackness of Lady\nEustace. In his estimation no punishment could be too great for\nher,--and yet he began to understand that she would escape scot-free!\nHer evidence would be needed to convict the thieves, and she could\nnot be prosecuted for perjury when once she had been asked for\nher evidence. \"After all, she has only told a fib about her own\nproperty,\" said the Turtle Dove. \"About property not her own,\"\nreplied Mr. Camperdown stoutly. \"Her own,--till the contrary shall\nhave been proved; her own, for all purposes of defence before a jury,\nif she were prosecuted now. Were she tried for the perjury, your\nattempt to obtain possession of the diamonds would be all so much in\nher favour.\" With infinite regrets, Mr. Camperdown began to perceive\nthat nothing could be done to her.\n\nBut she was to come to him and let him know, from her own lips,\nfacts of which nothing more than rumour had yet reached him.\nHe had commenced his bill in Chancery, and had hitherto stayed\nproceedings simply because it had been reported,--falsely, as it\nnow appeared,--that the diamonds had been stolen at Carlisle. Major\nMackintosh, in his desire to use Lizzie's evidence against the\nthieves, had recommended her to tell the whole truth openly to those\nwho claimed the property on behalf of her husband's estate; and now,\nfor the first time in her life, this odious woman was to visit him in\nhis own chambers.\n\nHe did not think it expedient to receive her alone. He consulted\nhis mentor, Mr. Dove, and his client, John Eustace, and the latter\nconsented to be present. It was suggested to Mr. Dove that he might,\non so peculiar an occasion as this, venture to depart from the\nestablished rule, and visit the attorney on his own quarter-deck;\nbut he smiled, and explained that, though he was altogether superior\nto any such prejudice as that, and would not object at all to call\non his friend, Mr. Camperdown, could any good effect arise from his\ndoing so, he considered that, were he to be present on this occasion,\nhe would simply assist in embarrassing the poor lady.\n\nOn this very morning, while Mrs. Carbuncle was abusing Lizzie in\nHertford Street, John Eustace and Mr. Camperdown were in Mr. Dove's\nchambers, whither they had gone to tell him of the coming interview.\nThe Turtle Dove was sitting back in his chair, with his head leaning\nforward as though it were going to drop from his neck, and the two\nvisitors were listening to his words. \"Be merciful, I should say,\"\nsuggested the barrister. John Eustace was clearly of opinion that\nthey ought to be merciful. Mr. Camperdown did not look merciful.\n\"What can you get by harassing the poor, weak, ignorant creature?\"\ncontinued Mr. Dove. \"She has hankered after her bauble, and has told\nfalsehoods in her efforts to keep it. Have you never heard of older\npersons, and more learned persons, and persons nearer to ourselves,\nwho have done the same?\" At that moment there was presumed to be\ngreat rivalry, not unaccompanied by intrigue, among certain leaders\nof the learned profession with reference to various positions of\nhigh honour and emolument, vacant or expected to be vacant. A Lord\nChancellor was about to resign, and a Lord Justice had died. Whether\na somewhat unpopular Attorney-General should be forced to satisfy\nhimself with the one place, or allowed to wait for the other,\nhad been debated in all the newspapers. It was agreed that there\nwas a middle course in reference to a certain second-class\nChief-Justiceship,--only that the present second-class Chief-Justice\nobjected to shelving himself. There existed considerable jealousy,\nand some statements had been made which were not, perhaps, strictly\nfounded on fact. It was understood, both by the attorney and by the\nMember of Parliament, that the Turtle Dove was referring to these\ncircumstances when he spoke of baubles and falsehoods, and of\nlearned persons near to themselves. He himself had hankered after no\nbauble,--but, as is the case with many men and women who are free\nfrom such hankerings, he was hardly free from that dash of malice\nwhich the possession of such things in the hands of others is so\nprone to excite. \"Spare her,\" said Mr. Dove. \"There is no longer\nany material question as to the property, which seems to be gone\nirrecoverably. It is, upon the whole, well for the world, that\nproperty so fictitious as diamonds should be subject to the risk\nof such annihilation. As far as we are concerned, the property\nis annihilated, and I would not harass the poor, ignorant young\ncreature.\"\n\nAs Eustace and the attorney walked across from the Old to the New\nSquare, the former declared that he quite agreed with Mr. Dove. \"In\nthe first place, Mr. Camperdown, she is my brother's widow.\" Mr.\nCamperdown with sorrow admitted the fact. \"And she is the mother of\nthe head of our family. It should not be for us to degrade her;--but\nrather to protect her from degradation, if that be possible.\" \"I\nheartily wish she had got her merits before your poor brother ever\nsaw her,\" said Mr. Camperdown.\n\nLizzie, in her fears, had been very punctual; and when the two\ngentlemen reached the door leading up to Mr. Camperdown's chambers,\nthe carriage was already standing there. Lizzie had come up the\nstairs, and had been delighted at hearing that Mr. Camperdown was\nout, and would be back in a moment. She instantly resolved that\nit did not become her to wait. She had kept her appointment, had\nnot found Mr. Camperdown at home, and would be off as fast as her\ncarriage-wheels could take her. But, unfortunately, while with a\ngentle murmur she was explaining to the clerk how impossible it\nwas that she should wait for a lawyer who did not keep his own\nappointment, John Eustace and Mr. Camperdown appeared upon the\nlanding, and she was at once convoyed into the attorney's particular\nroom.\n\nLizzie, who always dressed well, was now attired as became a lady of\nrank, who had four thousand a year, and was the intimate friend of\nLady Glencora Palliser. When last she saw Mr. Camperdown she had\nbeen arrayed for a long, dusty summer journey down to Scotland, and\nneither by her outside garniture nor by her manner had she then been\nable to exact much admiration. She had been taken by surprise in the\nstreet, and was frightened. Now, in difficulty though she was, she\nresolved that she would hold up her head and be very brave. She was\na little taken aback when she saw her brother-in-law, but she strove\nhard to carry herself with confidence. \"Ah, John,\" she said, \"I did\nnot expect to find you with Mr. Camperdown.\"\n\n\"I thought it best that I should be here,--as a friend,\" he said.\n\n\"It makes it much pleasanter for me, of course,\" said Lizzie. \"I am\nnot quite sure that Mr. Camperdown will allow me to regard him as a\nfriend.\"\n\n\"You have never had any reason to regard me as your enemy, Lady\nEustace,\" said Mr. Camperdown. \"Will you take a seat? I understand\nthat you wish to state the circumstances under which the Eustace\nfamily diamonds were stolen while they were in your hands.\"\n\n\"My own diamonds, Mr. Camperdown.\"\n\n\"I cannot admit that for a moment, my lady.\"\n\n\"What does it signify?\" said Eustace. \"The wretched stones are\ngone for ever; and whether they were of right the property of my\nsister-in-law, or of her son, cannot matter now.\"\n\nMr. Camperdown was irritated, and shook his head. It cut him to the\nheart that everybody should take the part of the wicked, fraudulent\nwoman who had caused him such infinite trouble. Lizzie saw her\nopportunity and was bolder than ever. \"You will never get me to\nacknowledge that they were not my own,\" she said. \"My husband gave\nthem to me, and I know that they were my own.\"\n\n\"They have been stolen, at any rate,\" said the lawyer.\n\n\"Yes;--they have been stolen.\"\n\n\"And now will you tell us how?\"\n\nLizzie looked round upon her brother-in-law and sighed. She had never\nyet told the story in all its nakedness, although it had been three\nor four times extracted from her by admission. She paused, hoping\nthat questions might be asked her which she could answer by easy\nmonosyllables, but not a word was uttered to help her. \"I suppose you\nknow all about it,\" she said at last.\n\n\"I know nothing about it,\" said Mr. Camperdown.\n\n\"We heard that your jewel-case was taken out of your room at Carlisle\nand broken open,\" said Eustace.\n\n\"So it was. They broke into my room in the dead of night, when I was\nin bed, fast asleep, and took the case away. When the morning came,\neverybody rushed into my room, and I was so frightened that I did not\nknow what I was doing. How would your daughter bear it, if two men\ncut away the locks and got into her bedroom when she was asleep? You\ndon't think about that at all.\"\n\n\"And where was the necklace?\" asked Eustace.\n\nLizzie remembered that her friend the major had specially advised her\nto tell the whole truth to Mr. Camperdown,--suggesting that by doing\nso she would go far towards saving herself from any prosecution. \"It\nwas under my pillow,\" she whispered.\n\n\"And why did you not tell the magistrate that it had been under your\npillow?\"\n\nMr. Camperdown's voice, as he put to her this vital question, was\nsevere, and almost justified the little burst of sobs which came\nforth as a prelude to Lizzie's answer. \"I did not know what I was\ndoing. I don't know what you expect from me. You had been persecuting\nme ever since Sir Florian's death about the diamonds, and I didn't\nknow what I was to do. They were my own, and I thought I was not\nobliged to tell everybody where I kept them. There are things which\nnobody tells. If I were to ask you all your secrets, would you tell\nthem? When Sir Walter Scott was asked whether he wrote the novels, he\ndidn't tell.\"\n\n\"He was not upon his oath, Lady Eustace.\"\n\n\"He did take his oath,--ever so many times. I don't know what\ndifference an oath makes. People ain't obliged to tell their secrets,\nand I wouldn't tell mine.\"\n\n\"The difference is this, Lady Eustace;--that if you give false\nevidence upon oath, you commit perjury.\"\n\n\"How was I to think of that, when I was so frightened and confused\nthat I didn't know where I was or what I was doing? There;--now I\nhave told you everything.\"\n\n\"Not quite everything. The diamonds were not stolen at Carlisle, but\nthey were stolen afterwards. Did you tell the police what you had\nlost,--or the magistrate,--after the robbery in Hertford Street?\"\n\n\"Yes; I did. There was some money taken, and rings, and other\njewellery.\"\n\n\"Did you tell them that the diamonds had been really stolen on that\noccasion?\"\n\n\"They never asked me, Mr. Camperdown.\"\n\n\"It is all as clear as a pike-staff, John,\" said the lawyer.\n\n\"Quite clear, I should say,\" replied Mr. Eustace.\n\n\"And I suppose I may go,\" said Lizzie, rising from her chair.\n\nThere was no reason why she should not go; and, indeed, now that\nthe interview was over, there did not seem to be any reason why she\nshould have come. Though they had heard so much from her own mouth,\nthey knew no more than they had known before. The great mystery\nhad been elucidated, and Lizzie Eustace had been found to be the\nintriguing villain; but it was quite clear, even to Mr. Camperdown,\nthat nothing could be done to her. He had never really thought that\nit would be expedient that she should be prosecuted for perjury, and\nhe now found that she must go utterly scatheless, although, by her\nobstinacy and dishonesty, she had inflicted so great a loss on the\ndistinguished family which had taken her to its bosom. \"I have no\nreason for wishing to detain you, Lady Eustace,\" he said. \"If I were\nto talk for ever, I should not, probably, make you understand the\nextent of the injury you have done, or teach you to look in a proper\nlight at the position in which you have placed yourself and all those\nwho belong to you. When your husband died, good advice was given you,\nand given, I think, in a very kind way. You would not listen to it,\nand you see the result.\"\n\n\"I ain't a bit ashamed of anything,\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"I suppose not,\" rejoined Mr. Camperdown.\n\n\"Good-bye, John.\" And Lizzie put out her hand to her brother-in-law.\n\n\"Good-bye, Lizzie.\"\n\n\"Mr. Camperdown, I have the honour to wish you good morning.\" And\nLizzie made a low curtsey to the lawyer, and was then attended to her\ncarriage by the lawyer's clerk. She had certainly come forth from the\ninterview without fresh wounds.\n\n\"The barrister who will have the cross-examining of her at the\nCentral Criminal Court,\" said Mr. Camperdown, as soon as the door was\nclosed behind her, \"will have a job of work on his hands. There's\nnothing a pretty woman can't do when she has got rid of all sense of\nshame.\"\n\n\"She is a very great woman,\" said John Eustace,--\"a very great woman;\nand, if the sex could have its rights, would make an excellent\nlawyer.\" In the meantime Lizzie Eustace returned home to Hertford\nStreet in triumph.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXIII\n\nLizzie's Last Lover\n\n\nLizzie's interview with the lawyer took place on the Wednesday\nafternoon, and, on her return to Hertford Street she found a note\nfrom Mrs. Carbuncle. \"I have made arrangements for dining out to-day,\nand shall not return till after ten. I will do the same to-morrow,\nand on every day till you leave town, and you can breakfast in your\nown room. Of course you will carry out your plan for leaving this\nhouse on Monday. After what has passed, I shall prefer not to meet\nyou again.--J.C.\" And this was written by a woman who, but a few days\nsince, had borrowed \u00c2\u00a3150 from her, and who at this moment had in her\nhands fifty pounds' worth of silver-plate, supposed to have been\ngiven to Lucinda, and which clearly ought to have been returned to\nthe donor when Lucinda's marriage was--postponed, as the newspapers\nhad said! Lucinda at this time had left the house in Hertford Street,\nbut Lizzie had not been informed whither she had been taken. She\ncould not apply to Lucinda for restitution of the silver,--which was,\nin fact, held at the moment by the Albemarle Street hotel-keeper\nas part security for his debt,--and she was quite sure that any\napplication to Mrs. Carbuncle for either the silver or the debt would\nbe unavailing. But she might, perhaps, cause annoyance by a letter,\nand could, at any rate, return insult for insult. She therefore wrote\nto her late friend.\n\n\n   MADAM,\n\n   I certainly am not desirous of continuing an acquaintance\n   into which I was led by false representations, and in the\n   course of which I have been almost absurdly hospitable to\n   persons altogether unworthy of my kindness. You, and your\n   niece, and your especial friend Lord George Carruthers,\n   and that unfortunate young man your niece's lover, were\n   entertained at my country-house as my guests for some\n   months. I am here, in my own right, by arrangement; and\n   as I pay more than a proper share of the expense of the\n   establishment, I shall stay as long as I please, and go\n   when I please.\n\n   In the meantime, as we are about to part, certainly for\n   ever, I must beg you at once to repay me the sum of\n   \u00c2\u00a3150,--which you have borrowed from me; and I must also\n   insist on your letting me have back the present of silver\n   which was prepared for your niece's marriage. That you\n   should retain it as a perquisite for yourself cannot for\n   a moment be thought of, however convenient it might be to\n   yourself.\n\n   Yours, &c.,\n\n   E. EUSTACE.\n\n\nAs far as the application for restitution went, or indeed in regard\nto the insult, she might as well have written to a milestone. Mrs.\nCarbuncle was much too strong, and had fought her battle with the\nworld much too long, to regard such word-pelting as that. She paid no\nattention to the note, and as she had come to terms with the agent of\nthe house by which she was to evacuate it on the following Monday,--a\nfact which was communicated to Lizzie by the servant,--she did not\nmuch regard Lizzie's threat to remain there. She knew, moreover, that\narrangements were already being made for the journey to Scotland.\n\nLizzie had come back from the attorney's chambers in triumph, and\nhad been triumphant when she wrote her note to Mrs. Carbuncle; but\nher elation was considerably repressed by a short notice which she\nread in the fashionable evening paper of the day. She always took the\nfashionable evening paper, and had taught herself to think that life\nwithout it was impossible. But on this afternoon she quarrelled\nwith that fashionable evening paper for ever. The popular and\nwell-informed organ of intelligence in question informed its readers,\nthat the Eustace diamonds--&c., &c. In fact, it told the whole\nstory; and then expressed a hope that, as the matter had from the\ncommencement been one of great interest to the public, who had\nsympathised with Lady Eustace deeply as to the loss of her diamonds,\nLady Eustace would be able to explain that part of her conduct\nwhich certainly, at present, was quite unintelligible. Lizzie threw\nthe paper from her with indignation, asking what right newspaper\nscribblers could have to interfere with the private affairs of such\npersons as herself!\n\nBut on this evening the question of her answer to Lord Fawn was\nthe one which most interested her. Lord Fawn had taken long in the\nwriting of his letter, and she was justified in taking what time she\npleased in answering it;--but, for her own sake, it had better be\nanswered quickly. She had tried her hand at two different replies,\nand did not at all doubt but what she would send the affirmative\nanswer, if she were sure that these latter discoveries would not\nalter Lord Fawn's decision. Lord Fawn had distinctly told her that,\nif she pleased, he would marry her. She would please;--having been\nmuch troubled by the circumstances of the past six months. But then,\nwas it not almost a certainty that Lord Fawn would retreat from his\noffer on learning the facts which were now so well known as to have\nbeen related in the public papers? She thought that she would take\none more night to think of it.\n\nAlas! she took one night too many. On the next morning, while she was\nstill in bed, a letter was brought to her from Lord Fawn, dated from\nhis club the preceding evening. \"Lord Fawn presents his compliments\nto Lady Eustace. Lady Eustace will be kind enough to understand that\nLord Fawn recedes altogether from the proposition made by him in his\nletter to Lady Eustace dated March 28th last. Should Lady Eustace\nthink proper to call in question the propriety of this decision on\nthe part of Lord Fawn, she had better refer the question to some\nfriend, and Lord Fawn will do the same. Lord Fawn thinks it best to\nexpress his determination, under no circumstances, to communicate\nagain personally with Lady Eustace on this subject,--or, as far as he\ncan see at present, on any other.\"\n\nThe letter was a blow to her, although she had felt quite certain\nthat Lord Fawn would have no difficulty in escaping from her hands\nas soon as the story of the diamonds should be made public. It was a\nblow to her, although she had assured herself a dozen times that a\nmarriage with such a one as Lord Fawn, a man who had not a grain of\npoetry in his composition, would make her unutterably wretched. What\nescape would her heart have had from itself in such a union? This\nquestion she had asked herself over and over again, and there had\nbeen no answer to it. But then why had she not been beforehand with\nLord Fawn? Why had she not rejected his second offer with the scorn\nwhich such an offer had deserved? Ah,--there was her misfortune;\nthere was her fault!\n\nBut, with Lizzie Eustace, when she could not do a thing which it\nwas desirable that she should be known to have done, the next\nconsideration was whether she could not so arrange as to seem to have\ndone it. The arrival of Lord Fawn's note just as she was about to\nwrite to him, was unfortunate. But she would still write to him, and\ndate her letter before the time that his was dated. He probably would\nnot believe her date. She hardly ever expected to be really believed\nby anybody. But he would have to read what she wrote; and writing on\nthis pretence, she would avoid the necessity of alluding to his last\nletter.\n\nNeither of the notes which she had by her quite suited the\noccasion,--so she wrote a third. The former letter in which she\ndeclined his offer was, she thought, very charmingly insolent, and\nthe allusion to his lordship's scullion would have been successful,\nhad it been sent on the moment, but now a graver letter was\nrequired,--and the graver letter was as follows:--\n\n\n   Hertford Street, Wednesday, April 3.\n\n\n--The date, it will be observed, was the day previous to the morning\non which she had received Lord Fawn's last very conclusive note.--\n\n\n   MY LORD,\n\n   I have taken a week to answer the letter which your\n   lordship has done me the honour of writing to me, because\n   I have thought it best to have time for consideration in\n   a matter of such importance. In this I have copied your\n   lordship's official caution.\n\n   I think I never read a letter so false, so unmanly, and so\n   cowardly, as that which you have found yourself capable of\n   sending to me.\n\n   You became engaged to me when, as I admit with shame, I\n   did not know your character. You have since repudiated me\n   and vilified my name, simply because, having found that I\n   had enemies, and being afraid to face them, you wished to\n   escape from your engagement. It has been cowardice from\n   the beginning to the end. Your whole conduct to me has\n   been one long, unprovoked insult, studiously concocted,\n   because you have feared that there might possibly be\n   some trouble for you to encounter. Nobody ever heard of\n   anything so mean, either in novels or in real life.\n\n   And now you again offer to marry me,--because you are\n   again afraid. You think you will be thrashed, I suppose,\n   if you decline to keep your engagement; and feel that if\n   you offer to go on with it, my friends cannot beat you.\n   You need not be afraid. No earthly consideration would\n   induce me to be your wife. And if any friend of mine\n   should look at you as though he meant to punish you, you\n   can show him this letter and make him understand that it\n   is I who have refused to be your wife, and not you who\n   have refused to be my husband.\n\n   E. EUSTACE.\n\n\nThis epistle Lizzie did send, believing that she could add nothing to\nits insolence, let her study it as she might. And, she thought, as\nshe read it for the fifth time, that it sounded as though it had been\nwritten before her receipt of the final note from himself, and that\nit would, therefore, irritate him the more.\n\nThis was to be the last week of her sojourn in town, and then she was\nto go down and bury herself at Portray, with no other companionship\nthan that of the faithful Macnulty, who had been left in Scotland for\nthe last three months as nurse-in-chief to the little heir. She must\ngo and give her evidence before the magistrate on Friday, as to which\nshe had already received an odious slip of paper;--but Frank would\naccompany her. Other misfortunes had passed off so lightly that she\nhardly dreaded this. She did not quite understand why she was to\nbe so banished, and thought much on the subject. She had submitted\nherself to Frank's advice when first she had begun to fear that her\ntroubles would be insuperable. Her troubles were now disappearing;\nand, as for Frank,--what was Frank to her, that she should obey him?\nNevertheless, her trunks were being already packed, and she knew that\nshe must go. He was to accompany her on her journey, and she would\nstill have one more chance with him.\n\nAs she was thinking of all this, Mr. Emilius, the clergyman, was\nannounced. In her loneliness she was delighted to receive any\nvisitor, and she knew that Mr. Emilius would be at least courteous to\nher. When he had seated himself, he at once began to talk about the\nmisfortune of the unaccomplished marriage, and in a very low voice\nhinted that from the beginning to end there had been something wrong.\nHe had always feared that an alliance based on a footing that was so\nopenly \"pecuniary,\"--he declared that the word pecuniary expressed\nhis meaning better than any other epithet,--could not lead to\nmatrimonial happiness. \"We all know,\" said he, \"that our dear\nfriend, Mrs. Carbuncle, had views of her own quite distinct from her\nniece's happiness. I have the greatest possible respect for Mrs.\nCarbuncle,--and I may say esteem; but it is impossible to live long\nin any degree of intimacy with Mrs. Carbuncle without seeing that she\nis--mercenary.\"\n\n\"Mercenary;--indeed she is,\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"You have observed it? Oh, yes; it is so, and it casts a shadow over\na character which otherwise has so much to charm.\"\n\n\"She is the most insolent and the most ungrateful woman that I ever\nheard of!\" exclaimed Lizzie, with energy. Mr. Emilius opened his\neyes, but did not contradict her assertion. \"As you have mentioned\nher name, Mr. Emilius, I must tell you. I have done everything for\nthat woman. You know how I treated her down in Scotland.\"\n\n\"With a splendid hospitality,\" said Mr. Emilius.\n\n\"Of course she did not pay for anything there.\"\n\n\"Oh, no.\" The idea of any one being called upon to pay for what one\nate and drank at a friend's house, was peculiarly painful to Mr.\nEmilius.\n\n\"And I have paid for everything here. That is to say, we have made an\narrangement, very much in her favour. And she has borrowed large sums\nof money from me.\"\n\n\"I am not at all surprised at that,\" said Mr. Emilius.\n\n\"And when that unfortunate girl, her niece, was to be married to poor\nSir Griffin Tewett, I gave her a whole service of plate.\"\n\n\"What unparalleled generosity!\"\n\n\"Would you believe she has taken the whole for her own base purposes?\nAnd then what do you think she has done?\"\n\n\"My dear Lady Eustace, hardly anything would astonish me.\"\n\nLizzie suddenly found a difficulty in describing to her friend the\nfact that Mrs. Carbuncle was endeavouring to turn her out of the\nhouse, without also alluding to her own troubles about the robbery.\n\"She has actually told me,\" she continued, \"that I must leave the\nhouse without a day's warning. But I believe the truth is, that she\nhas run so much into debt that she cannot remain.\"\n\n\"I know that she is very much in debt, Lady Eustace.\"\n\n\"But she owed me some civility. Instead of that, she has treated me\nwith nothing but insolence. And why, do you think? It is all because\nI would not allow her to take that poor, insane young woman to\nPortray Castle.\"\n\n\"You don't mean that she asked to go there?\"\n\n\"She did, though.\"\n\n\"I never heard such impertinence in my life,--never,\" said Mr.\nEmilius, again opening his eyes and shaking his head.\n\n\"She proposed that I should ask them both down to Portray,\nfor--for--of course it would have been almost for ever. I don't know\nhow I should have got rid of them. And that poor young woman is mad,\nyou know;--quite mad. She never recovered herself after that morning.\nOh,--what I have suffered about that unhappy marriage, and the cruel,\ncruel way in which Mrs. Carbuncle urged it on. Mr. Emilius, you can't\nconceive the scenes which have been acted in this house during the\nlast month. It has been dreadful. I wouldn't go through such a time\nagain for anything that could be offered to me. It has made me so ill\nthat I am obliged to go down to Scotland to recruit my health.\"\n\n\"I heard that you were going to Scotland, and I wished to have an\nopportunity of saying--just a word to you, in private, before you\ngo.\" Mr. Emilius had thought a good deal about this interview, and\nhad prepared himself for it with considerable care. He knew, with\ntolerable accuracy, the whole story of the necklace, having discussed\nit with Mrs. Carbuncle, who, as the reader will remember, had been\ntold the tale by Lord George. He was aware of the engagement with\nLord Fawn, and of the growing intimacy which had existed between Lord\nGeorge and Lizzie. He had been watchful, diligent, patient, and had\nat last become hopeful. When he learned that his beloved was about\nto start for Scotland, he felt that it would be well that he should\nstrike a blow before she went. As to a journey down to Ayrshire, that\nwould be nothing to one so enamoured as was Mr. Emilius; and he would\nnot scruple to show himself at the castle-door without invitation.\nWhatever may have been his deficiencies, Mr. Emilius did not lack\nthe courage needed to carry such an enterprise as this to a happy\nconclusion. As far as pluck and courage might serve a man, he was\nwell served by his own gifts. He could, without a blush, or a quiver\nin his voice, have asked a duchess to marry him, with ten times\nLizzie's income. He had now considered deeply whether, with the view\nof prevailing, it would be better that he should allude to the lady's\ntrespasses in regard to the diamonds, or that he should pretend to be\nin ignorance; and he had determined that ultimate success might, with\nmost probability, be achieved by a bold declaration of the truth.\n\"I know how desperately you must be in want of some one to help you\nthrough your troubles, and I know also that your grand lovers will\navoid you because of what you have done, and therefore you had better\ntake me at once. Take me, and I'll bring you through everything.\nRefuse me, and I'll help to crush you.\" Such were the arguments\nwhich Mr. Emilius had determined to use, and such the language,--of\ncourse, with some modifications. He was now commencing his work, and\nwas quite resolved to leave no stone unturned in carrying it to a\nsuccessful issue. He drew his chair nearer to Lizzie as he announced\nhis desire for a private interview, and leaned over towards her with\nhis two hands closed together between his knees. He was a dark,\nhookey-nosed, well-made man, with an exuberance of greasy hair, who\nwould have been considered handsome by many women, had there not been\nsomething, almost amounting to a squint, amiss with one of his eyes.\nWhen he was preaching, it could hardly be seen, but in the closeness\nof private conversation it was disagreeable.\n\n\"Oh,--indeed!\" said Lizzie, with a look of astonishment, perfectly\nwell assumed. She had already begun to consider whether, after all,\nMr. Emilius--would do.\n\n\"Yes;--Lady Eustace; it is so. You and I have known each other now\nfor many months, and I have received the most unaffected pleasure\nfrom the acquaintance,--may I not say from the intimacy which has\nsprung up between us?\" Lizzie did not forbid the use of the pleasant\nword, but merely bowed. \"I think that, as a devoted friend and a\nclergyman, I shall not be thought to be intruding on private ground\nin saying that circumstances have made me aware of the details of the\nrobberies by which you have been so cruelly persecuted.\" So the man\nhad come about the diamonds, and not to make an offer! Lizzie raised\nher eyebrows and bowed her head with the slightest possible motion.\n\"I do not know how far your friends or the public may condemn you,\nbut--\"\n\n\"My friends don't condemn me at all, sir.\"\n\n\"I am so glad to hear it!\"\n\n\"Nobody has dared to condemn me, except this impudent woman here, who\nwants an excuse for not paying me what she owes me.\"\n\n\"I am delighted. I was going to explain that although I am aware you\nhave infringed the letter of the law, and made yourself liable to\nproceedings which may, perhaps, be unpleasant--\"\n\n\"I ain't liable to anything unpleasant at all, Mr. Emilius.\"\n\n\"Then my mind is greatly relieved. I was about to remark, having\nheard in the outer world that there were those who ventured to accuse\nyou of--of perjury--\"\n\n\"Nobody has dared to accuse me of anything. What makes you come here\nand say such things?\"\n\n\"Ah,--Lady Eustace. It is because these calumnies are spoken so\nopenly behind your back.\"\n\n\"Who speaks them? Mrs. Carbuncle, and Lord George Carruthers;--my\nenemies.\"\n\nMr. Emilius was beginning to feel that he was not making progress. \"I\nwas on the point of observing to you that according to the view of\nthe matter which I, as a clergyman, have taken, you were altogether\njustified in the steps which you took for the protection of property\nwhich was your own, but which had been attacked by designing\npersons.\"\n\n\"Of course I was justified,\" said Lizzie.\n\n\"You know best, Lady Eustace, whether any assistance I can offer will\navail you anything.\"\n\n\"I don't want any assistance, Mr. Emilius,--thank you.\"\n\n\"I certainly have been given to understand that they who ought to\nstand by you with the closest devotion have, in this period of what\nI may, perhaps, call--tribulation, deserted your side with cold\nselfishness.\"\n\n\"But there isn't any tribulation, and nobody has deserted my side.\"\n\n\"I was told that Lord Fawn--\"\n\n\"Lord Fawn is an idiot.\"\n\n\"Quite so;--no doubt.\"\n\n\"And I have deserted him. I wrote to him this very morning, in answer\nto a pressing letter from him to renew our engagement, to tell him\nthat that was out of the question. I despise Lord Fawn, and my heart\nnever can be given where my respect does not accompany it.\"\n\n\"A noble sentiment, Lady Eustace, which I reciprocate completely. And\nnow, to come to what I may call the inner purport of my visit to you\nthis morning, the sweet cause of my attendance on you, let me assure\nyou that I should not now offer you my heart, unless with my heart\nwent the most perfect respect and esteem which any man ever felt for\na woman.\" Mr. Emilius had found the necessity of coming to the point\nby some direct road, as the lady had refused to allow him to lead up\nto it in the manner he had proposed to himself. He still thought that\nwhat he had said might be efficacious, as he did not for a moment\nbelieve her assertions as to her own friends, and the non-existence\nof any trouble as to the oaths which she had falsely sworn. But she\ncarried the matter with a better courage than he had expected to\nfind, and drove him out of his intended line of approach. He had,\nhowever, seized his opportunity without losing much time.\n\n\"What on earth do you mean, Mr. Emilius?\" she said.\n\n\"I mean to lay my heart, my hand, my fortunes, my profession, my\ncareer at your feet. I make bold to say of myself that I have, by\nmy own unaided eloquence and intelligence, won for myself a great\nposition in this swarming metropolis. Lady Eustace, I know your great\nrank. I feel your transcendent beauty,--ah, too acutely. I have been\ntold that you are rich. But I, myself, who venture to approach you\nas a suitor for your hand, am also somebody in the world. The blood\nthat runs in my veins is as illustrious as your own, having descended\nto me from the great and ancient nobles of my native country. The\nprofession which I have adopted is the grandest which ever filled the\nheart of man with aspirations. I have barely turned my thirty-second\nyear, and I am known as the greatest preacher of my day, though I\npreach in a language which is not my own. Your House of Lords would\nbe open to me as a spiritual peer, would I condescend to come to\nterms with those who crave the assistance which I could give them. I\ncan move the masses. I can touch the hearts of men. And in this great\nassemblage of mankind which you call London, I can choose my own\nsociety among the highest of the land. Lady Eustace, will you share\nwith me my career and my fortunes? I ask you, because you are the\nonly woman whom my heart has stooped to love.\"\n\nThe man was a nasty, greasy, lying, squinting Jew preacher; an\nimpostor, over forty years of age, whose greatest social success had\nbeen achieved when, through the agency of Mrs. Carbuncle, he made his\nway into Portray Castle. He was about as near an English mitre as had\nbeen that great man of a past generation, the Deputy Shepherd. He\nwas a creature to loathe,--because he was greasy, and a liar, and an\nimpostor. But there was a certain manliness in him. He was not afraid\nof the woman; and in pleading his cause with her he could stand up\nfor himself courageously. He had studied his speech, and having\nstudied it, he knew how to utter the words. He did not blush, nor\nstammer, nor cringe. Of grandfather or grandmother belonging to\nhimself he had probably never heard, but he could so speak of his\nnoble ancestors as to produce belief in Lizzie's mind. And he almost\nsucceeded in convincing her that he was, by the consent of mankind,\nthe greatest preacher of the day. While he was making his speech\nshe almost liked his squint. She certainly liked the grease and\nnastiness. Presuming, as she naturally did, that something of what he\nsaid was false, she liked the lies. There was a dash of poetry about\nhim; and poetry, as she thought, was not compatible with humdrum\ntruth. A man, to be a man in her eyes, should be able to swear that\nall his geese are swans;--should be able to reckon his swans by the\ndozen, though he have not a feather belonging to him, even from a\ngoose's wing. She liked his audacity; and then, when he was making\nlove, he was not afraid of talking out boldly about his heart.\nNevertheless he was only Mr. Emilius, the clergyman; and she had\nmeans of knowing that his income was not generous. Though she\nadmired his manner and his language, she was quite aware that he\nwas in pursuit of her money. And from the moment in which she first\nunderstood his object, she was resolved that she would never become\nthe wife of Mr. Emilius as long as there was a hope as to Frank\nGreystock.\n\n\"I was told, Mr. Emilius,\" she said, \"that some time since you used\nto have a wife.\"\n\n\"It was a falsehood, Lady Eustace. From motives of pure charity I\ngave a home to a distant cousin. I was then in a land of strangers,\nand my life was misinterpreted. I made no complaint, but sent the\nlady back to her native country. My compassion could supply her wants\nthere as well as here.\"\n\n\"Then you still support her?\"\n\nMr. Emilius bethought himself for a moment. There might be danger\nin asserting that he was subject to such an encumbrance. \"I did do\nso,\" he answered, \"till she found a congenial home as the wife of an\nhonest man.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed. I'm quite glad to hear that.\"\n\n\"And now, Lady Eustace, may I venture to hope for a favourable\nanswer?\"\n\nUpon this, Lizzie made him a speech as long and almost as well-turned\nas his own. Her heart had of late been subject to many vicissitudes.\nShe had lost the dearest husband that a woman had ever worshipped.\nShe had ventured, for purposes with reference to her child which she\ncould not now explain, to think once again of matrimony with a man\nof high rank, but who had turned out to be unworthy of her. She had\nreceded;--Lizzie, as she said this, acted the part of receding with a\nfine expression of scornful face;--and after that she was unwilling\nto entertain any further idea of marriage. Upon hearing this, Mr.\nEmilius bowed low, and before the street-door was closed against him\nhad begun to calculate how much a journey to Scotland would cost him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXIV\n\nLizzie at the Police-Court\n\n\nOn the Wednesday and Thursday Lizzie had been triumphant; for she had\ncertainly come out unscathed from Mr. Camperdown's chambers, and a\nlady may surely be said to triumph when a gentleman lays his hand,\nhis heart, his fortunes, and all that he has got, at her feet. But\nwhen the Friday came, though she was determined to be brave, her\nheart did sink within her bosom. She understood well that she would\nbe called upon to admit in public the falseness of the oaths she had\nsworn upon two occasions; and that, though she would not be made\namenable to any absolute punishment for her perjury, she would be\nsubject to very damaging remarks from the magistrate, and probably\nalso from some lawyers employed to defend the prisoners. She went\nto bed in fairly good spirits, but in the morning she was cowed and\nunhappy. She dressed herself from head to foot in black, and prepared\nfor herself a heavy black veil. She had ordered from the livery\nstable a brougham for the occasion, thinking it wise to avoid the\ndisplay of her own carriage. She breakfasted early, and then took a\nlarge glass of wine to support her. When Frank called for her at a\nquarter to ten, she was quite ready, and grasped his hand almost\nwithout a word. But she looked into his face with her eyes filled\nwith tears. \"It will soon be over,\" he said. She pressed his hand,\nand made him a sign to show that she was ready to follow him to the\ndoor. \"The case will come on at once,\" he said, \"so that you will not\nbe kept waiting.\"\n\n\"Oh, you are so good;--so good to me.\" She pressed his arm, and did\nnot speak another word on their way to the police-court.\n\nThere was a great crowd about the office, which was in a little\nby-street, and so circumstanced that Lizzie's brougham could hardly\nmake its way up to the door. But way was at once made for her when\nFrank handed her out of it, and the policemen about the place were as\ncourteous to her as though she had been the Lord Chancellor's wife.\nEvil-doing will be spoken of with bated breath and soft words even by\npolicemen, when the evil-doer comes in a carriage, and with a title.\nLizzie was led at once into a private room, and told that she would\nbe kept there only a very few minutes. Frank made his way into the\ncourt and found that two magistrates had just seated themselves on\nthe bench. One would have sufficed for the occasion; but this was\na case of great interest, and even police-magistrates are human in\ntheir interests. Greystock was allowed to get round to the bench, and\nto whisper a word or two to the gentleman who was to preside. The\nmagistrate nodded his head, and then the case began.\n\nThe unfortunate Mr. Benjamin had been sent back in durance vile\nfrom Vienna, and was present in the court. With him, as joint\nmalefactor, stood Mr. Smiler, the great housebreaker, a huge, ugly,\nresolute-looking scoundrel, possessed of enormous strength, who was\nvery intimately known to the police, with whom he had had various\ndealings since he had been turned out upon the town to earn his bread\nsome fifteen years before. Indeed, long before that he had known the\npolice. As far as his memory went back he had always known them. But\nthe sportive industry of his boyish years was not now counted up\nagainst him. In the last fifteen years his biography had been written\nwith all the accuracy due to the achievements of a great man; and\nduring those hundred and eighty months he had spent over one hundred\nin prison, and had been convicted twenty-three times. He was now\ngrowing old,--as a thief; and it was thought by his friends that he\nwould be settled for life in some quiet retreat. Mr. Benjamin was a\nvery respectable-looking man of about fifty, with slightly grizzled\nhair, with excellent black clothes, showing, by a surprised air, his\ngreat astonishment at finding himself in such a position. He spoke\nconstantly, both to his attorney and to the barrister who was to\nshow cause why he should not be committed, and throughout the whole\nmorning was very busy. Smiler, who was quite at home, and who\nunderstood his position, never said a word to any one. He stood,\nperfectly straight, looking at the magistrate, and never for a moment\nleaning on the rail before him during the four hours that the case\nconsumed. Once, when his friend, Billy Cann, was brought into court\nto give evidence against him, dressed up to the eyes, serene and\nsleek as when we saw him once before at the \"Rising Sun,\" in Meek\nStreet, Smiler turned a glance upon him which, to the eyes of all\npresent, contained a threat of most bloody revenge. But Billy knew\nthe advantages of his situation, and nodded at his old comrade, and\nsmiled. His old comrade was very much stronger than he, and possessed\nof many natural advantages; but, perhaps, upon the whole, his old\ncomrade had been the less intelligent thief of the two. It was thus\nthat the bystanders read the meaning of Billy's smile.\n\nThe case was opened very shortly and very clearly by the gentleman\nwho was employed for the prosecution. It would all, he said, have\nlaid in a nutshell, had it not been complicated by a previous robbery\nat Carlisle. Were it necessary, he said, there would be no difficulty\nin convicting the prisoners for that offence also, but it had been\nthought advisable to confine the prosecution to the act of burglary\ncommitted in Hertford Street. He stated the facts of what had\nhappened at Carlisle, merely for explanation, but would state nothing\nthat could not be proved. Then he told all that the reader knows\nabout the iron box. But the diamonds were not then in the box,--and\nhe told that story also, treating Lizzie with great tenderness as he\ndid so. Lizzie, all this time, was sitting behind her veil in the\nprivate room, and did not hear a word of what was going on. Then\nhe came to the robbery in Hertford Street. He would prove by Lady\nEustace that the diamonds were left by her in a locked desk,--were so\ndeposited, though all her friends believed them to have been taken\nat Carlisle; and he would, moreover, prove by accomplices that they\nwere stolen by two men,--the younger prisoner at the bar being one\nof them, and the witness who would be adduced, the other,--that they\nwere given up by these men to the elder prisoner, and that a certain\nsum had been paid by him for the execution of the two robberies.\nThere was much more of it;--but to the reader, who knows it all,\nit would be but a thrice-told tale. He then said that he first\nproposed to take the evidence of Lady Eustace, the lady who had been\nin possession of the diamonds when they were stolen. Then Frank\nGreystock left the court, and returned with poor Lizzie on his arm.\n\nShe was handed to a chair, and, after she was sworn, was told that\nshe might sit down. But she was requested to remove her veil, which\nshe had replaced as soon as she had kissed the book. The first\nquestion asked her was very easy. Did she remember the night at\nCarlisle? Would she tell the history of what occurred on that night?\nWhen the box was stolen, were the diamonds in it? No; she had taken\nthe diamonds out for security, and had kept them under her pillow.\nThen came a bitter moment, in which she had to confess her perjury\nbefore the Carlisle bench;--but even that seemed to pass off\nsmoothly. The magistrate asked one severe question. \"Do you\nmean to say, Lady Eustace, that you gave false evidence on that\noccasion,--knowing it to be false?\" \"I was in such a state, sir,\nfrom fear, that I did not know what I was saying,\" exclaimed Lizzie,\nbursting into tears and stretching forth towards the bench her two\nclasped hands with the air of a suppliant. From that moment the\nmagistrate was altogether on her side,--and so were the public. Poor\nignorant, ill-used young creature;--and then so lovely! That was the\ngeneral feeling. But she had not as yet come beneath the harrow of\nthe learned gentleman on the other side, whose best talents were due\nto Mr. Benjamin. Then she told all she knew about the other robbery.\nShe certainly had not said, when examined on that occasion, that the\ndiamonds had then been taken. She had omitted to name the diamonds\nin her catalogue of the things stolen; but she was sure that she had\nnever said that they were not then taken. She had said nothing about\nthe diamonds, knowing them to be her own, and preferring to lose them\nto the trouble of again referring to the night at Carlisle. Such was\nher evidence for the prosecution, and then she was turned over to the\nvery learned and very acute gentleman whom Mr. Benjamin had hired for\nhis defence,--or rather, to show cause why he should not be sent for\ntrial.\n\nIt must be owned that poor Lizzie did receive from his hands some of\nthat punishment which she certainly deserved. This acute and learned\ngentleman seemed to possess for the occasion the blandest and most\ndulcet voice that ever was bestowed upon an English barrister. He\naddressed Lady Eustace with the softest words, as though he hardly\ndared to speak to a woman so eminent for wealth, rank, and beauty;\nbut nevertheless he asked her some very disagreeable questions. \"Was\nhe to understand that she went of her own will before the bench\nof magistrates at Carlisle, with the view of enabling the police\nto capture certain persons for stealing certain jewels, while she\nknew that the jewels were actually in her own possession?\" Lizzie,\nconfounded by the softness of his voice as joined to the harshness of\nthe question, could hardly understand him, and he repeated it thrice,\nbecoming every time more and more mellifluous. \"Yes,\" said Lizzie at\nlast. \"Yes?\" he asked. \"Yes,\" said Lizzie. \"Your ladyship did send\nthe Cumberland police after men for stealing jewels which were in\nyour ladyship's own hands when you swore the information?\" \"Yes,\"\nsaid Lizzie. \"And your ladyship knew that the information was\nuntrue?\" \"Yes,\" said Lizzie. \"And the police were pursuing the men\nfor many weeks?\" \"Yes,\" said Lizzie. \"On your information?\" \"Yes,\"\nsaid Lizzie, through her tears. \"And your ladyship knew all the time\nthat the poor men were altogether innocent of taking the jewels?\"\n\"But they took the box,\" said Lizzie, through her tears. \"Yes,\" said\nthe acute and learned gentleman, \"somebody took your ladyship's\niron box out of the room, and you swore that the diamonds had been\ntaken. Was it not the fact that legal proceedings were being taken\nagainst you for recovery of the diamonds by persons who claimed the\nproperty?\" \"Yes,\" said Lizzie. \"And these persons withdrew their\nproceedings as soon as they heard that the diamonds had been stolen?\"\n\nSoft as he was in his manner, he nearly reduced Lizzie Eustace to\nfainting. It seemed to her that the questions would never end. It was\nin vain that the magistrate pointed out to the learned gentleman that\nLady Eustace had confessed her own false swearing, both at Carlisle\nand in London, a dozen times. He continued his questions over and\nover again, harping chiefly on the affair at Carlisle, and saying\nvery little as to the second robbery in Hertford Street. His idea was\nto make it appear that Lizzie had arranged the robbery with the view\nof defrauding Mr. Camperdown, and that Lord George Carruthers was\nher accomplice. He even asked her, almost in a whisper, and with the\nsweetest smile, whether she was not engaged to marry Lord George.\nWhen Lizzie denied this, he still suggested that some such alliance\nmight be in contemplation. Upon this, Frank Greystock called upon the\nmagistrate to defend Lady Eustace from such unnecessary vulgarity,\nand there was a scene in the court. Lizzie did not like the scene,\nbut it helped to protect her from the contemplation of the public,\nwho of course were much gratified by high words between two\nbarristers.\n\nLady Eustace was forced to remain in the private room during the\nexamination of Patience Crabstick and Mr. Cann; and she did not hear\nit. Patience was a most obdurate and difficult witness,--extremely\naverse to say evil of herself, and on that account unworthy\nof the good things which she had received. But Billy Cann was\ncharming,--graceful, communicative, and absolutely accurate. There\nwas no shaking him. The learned and acute gentleman who tried to tear\nhim in pieces could do nothing with him. He was asked whether he had\nnot been a professional thief for ten years. \"Ten or twelve,\" he\nsaid. Did he expect that any juryman would believe him on his oath?\n\"Not unless I am fully corroborated.\" \"Can you look that man in the\nface,--that man who is at any rate so much honester than yourself?\"\nasked the learned gentleman with pathos. Billy said that he thought\nhe could, and the way in which he smiled upon Smiler caused a roar\nthrough the whole court.\n\nThe two men were, as a matter of course, committed for trial at the\nCentral Criminal Court, and Lizzie Eustace was bound by certain\npenalties to come forward when called upon, and give her evidence\nagain. \"I am glad that it is over,\" said Frank, as he left her at\nMrs. Carbuncle's hall-door.\n\n\"Oh, Frank, dearest Frank, where should I be if it were not for you?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXV\n\nLord George Gives His Reasons\n\n\nLady Eustace did not leave the house during the Saturday and Sunday,\nand engaged herself exclusively with preparing for her journey. She\nhad no further interview with Mrs. Carbuncle, but there were messages\nbetween them, and even notes were written. They resulted in nothing.\nLizzie was desirous of getting back the spoons and forks, and, if\npossible, some of her money. The spoons and forks were out of Mrs.\nCarbuncle's power,--in Albemarle Street; and the money had of course\nbeen spent. Lizzie might have saved herself the trouble, had it\nnot been that it was a pleasure to her to insult her late friend,\neven though in doing so new insults were heaped upon her own head.\nAs for the trumpery spoons, they,--so said Mrs. Carbuncle,--were\nthe property of Miss Roanoke, having been made over to her\nunconditionally long before the wedding, as a part of a separate\npecuniary transaction. Mrs. Carbuncle had no power of disposing of\nMiss Roanoke's property. As to the money which Lady Eustace claimed,\nMrs. Carbuncle asserted that, when the final accounts should be made\nup between them, it would be found that there was a considerable\nbalance due to Mrs. Carbuncle. But even were there anything due\nto Lady Eustace, Mrs. Carbuncle would decline to pay it, as she\nwas informed that all moneys possessed by Lady Eustace were now\nconfiscated to the Crown by reason of the PERJURIES,--the word was\ndoubly scored in Mrs. Carbuncle's note,--which Lady Eustace had\ncommitted. This, of course, was unpleasant; but Mrs. Carbuncle did\nnot have the honours of the battle all to herself. Lizzie also said\nsome unpleasant things,--which, perhaps, were the more unpleasant\nbecause they were true. Mrs. Carbuncle had come pretty nearly to\nthe end of her career, whereas Lizzie's income, in spite of her\nperjuries, was comparatively untouched. The undoubted mistress of\nPortray Castle, and mother of the Sir Florian Eustace of the day,\ncould still despise and look down upon Mrs. Carbuncle, although she\nwere known to have told fibs about the family diamonds.\n\nLord George always came to Hertford Street on a Sunday, and Lady\nEustace left word for him with the servant that she would be glad to\nsee him before her journey into Scotland. \"Goes to-morrow, does she?\"\nsaid Lord George to the servant. \"Well; I'll see her.\" And he was\nshown up to her room before he went to Mrs. Carbuncle.\n\nLizzie, in sending to him, had some half-formed idea of a romantic\nfarewell. The man, she thought, had behaved very badly to her,--had\naccepted very much from her hands, and had refused to give her\nanything in return; had become the first depository of her great\nsecret, and had placed no mutual confidence in her. He had been harsh\nto her, and unjust; and then, too, he had declined to be in love with\nher! She was full of spite against Lord George, and would have been\nglad to injure him. But, nevertheless, there would be some excitement\nin a farewell in which some mock affection might be displayed, and\nshe would have an opportunity of abusing Mrs. Carbuncle.\n\n\"So you are off to-morrow?\" said Lord George, taking his place on the\nrug before her fire, and looking down at her with his head a little\non one side. Lizzie's anger against the man chiefly arose from a\nfeeling that he treated her with all a Corsair's freedom without\nany of a Corsair's tenderness. She could have forgiven the want of\ndeferential manner, had there been any devotion;--but Lord George was\nboth impudent and indifferent.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"Thank goodness, I shall get out of this frightful\nplace to-morrow, and soon have once more a roof of my own over my\nhead. What an experience I have had since I have been here!\"\n\n\"We have all had an experience,\" said Lord George, still looking at\nher with that half-comic turn of his face,--almost as though he were\ninvestigating some curious animal of which so remarkable a specimen\nhad never before come under his notice.\n\n\"No woman ever intended to show a more disinterested friendship than\nI have done; and what has been my return?\"\n\n\"You mean to me?--disinterested friendship to me?\" And Lord George\ntapped his breast lightly with his fingers. His head was still a\nlittle on one side, and there was still the smile upon his face.\n\n\"I was alluding particularly to Mrs. Carbuncle.\"\n\n\"Lady Eustace, I cannot take charge of Mrs. Carbuncle's friendships.\nI have enough to do to look after my own. If you have any complaint\nto make against me,--I will at least listen to it.\"\n\n\"God knows I do not want to make complaints,\" said Lizzie, covering\nher face with her hands.\n\n\"They don't do much good;--do they? It's better to take people as you\nfind 'em, and then make the best of 'em. They're a queer lot;--ain't\nthey,--the sort of people one meets about in the world?\"\n\n\"I don't know what you mean by that, Lord George.\"\n\n\"Just what you were saying, when you talked of your experiences.\nThese experiences do surprise one. I have knocked about the world a\ngreat deal, and would have almost said that nothing would surprise\nme. You are no more than a child to me, but you have surprised me.\"\n\n\"I hope I have not injured you, Lord George.\"\n\n\"Do you remember how you rode to hounds the day your cousin took that\nother man's horse? That surprised me.\"\n\n\"Oh, Lord George, that was the happiest day of my life. How little\nhappiness there is for people!\"\n\n\"And when Tewett got that girl to say she'd marry him, the coolness\nwith which you bore all the abomination of it in your house,--for\npeople who were nothing to you;--that surprised me!\"\n\n\"I meant to be so kind to you all.\"\n\n\"And when I found that you always travelled with ten thousand pounds'\nworth of diamonds in a box, that surprised me very much. I thought\nthat you were a very dangerous companion.\"\n\n\"Pray don't talk about the horrid necklace.\"\n\n\"Then came the robbery, and you seemed to lose your diamonds without\nbeing at all unhappy about them. Of course, we understand that now.\"\nOn hearing this, Lizzie smiled, but did not say a word. \"Then I\nperceived that I--I was supposed to be the thief. You--you yourself\ncouldn't have suspected me of taking the diamonds, because--because\nyou'd got them, you know, all safe in your pocket. But you might as\nwell own the truth now. Didn't you think that it was I who stole the\nbox?\"\n\n\"I wish it had been you,\" said Lizzie laughing.\n\n\"All that surprised me. The police were watching me every day as a\ncat watches a mouse, and thought that they surely had got the thief\nwhen they found that I had dealings with Benjamin. Well; you--you\nwere laughing at me in your sleeve all the time.\"\n\n\"Not laughing, Lord George.\"\n\n\"Yes, you were. You had got the kernel yourself, and thought that I\nhad taken all the trouble to crack the nut and had found myself with\nnothing but the shell. Then, when you found you couldn't eat the\nkernel, that you couldn't get rid of the swag without assistance, you\ncame to me to help you. I began to think then that you were too many\nfor all of us. By Jove, I did! Then I heard of the second robbery,\nand, of course, I thought you had managed that too.\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said Lizzie\n\n\"Unfortunately you didn't; but I thought you did. And you thought\nthat I had done it! Mr. Benjamin was too clever for us both, and\nnow he is going to have penal servitude for the rest of his life. I\nwonder who will be the better of it all. Who'll have the diamonds at\nlast?\"\n\n\"I do not in the least care. I hate the diamonds. Of course I would\nnot give them up, because they were my own.\"\n\n\"The end of it seems to be that you have lost your property, and\nsworn ever so many false oaths, and have brought all your friends\ninto trouble, and have got nothing by it. What was the good of being\nso clever?\"\n\n\"You need not come here to tease me, Lord George.\"\n\n\"I came here because you sent for me. There's my poor friend, Mrs.\nCarbuncle, declares that all her credit is destroyed, and her niece\nunable to marry, and her house taken away from her,--all because of\nher connexion with you.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Carbuncle is--is--is-- Oh, Lord George, don't you know what she\nis?\"\n\n\"I know that Mrs. Carbuncle is in a very bad way, and that that girl\nhas gone crazy, and that poor Griff has taken himself off to Japan,\nand that I am so knocked about that I don't know where to go; and\nsomehow it seems all to have come from your little manoeuvres. You\nsee, we have, all of us, been made remarkable; haven't we?\"\n\n\"You are always remarkable, Lord George.\"\n\n\"And it is all your doing. To be sure you have lost your diamonds for\nyour pains. I wouldn't mind it so much if anybody were the better for\nit. I shouldn't have begrudged even Benjamin the pull, if he'd got\nit.\"\n\nHe stood there, still looking down upon her, speaking with a\nsarcastic subrisive tone, and, as she felt, intending to be severe\nto her. She had sent for him, and now she didn't know what to say to\nhim. Though she believed that she hated him, she would have liked to\nget up some show of an affectionate farewell, some scene in which\nthere might have been tears, and tenderness, and poetry,--and,\nperhaps, a parting caress. But with his jeering words, and sneering\nface, he was as hard to her as a rock. He was now silent, but still\nlooking down upon her as he stood motionless upon the rug,--so that\nshe was compelled to speak again. \"I sent for you, Lord George,\nbecause I did not like the idea of parting with you for ever, without\none word of adieu.\"\n\n\"You are going to tear yourself away;--are you?\"\n\n\"I am going to Portray on Monday.\"\n\n\"And never coming back any more? You'll be up here before the season\nis over, with fifty more wonderful schemes in your little head. So\nLord Fawn is done with, is he?\"\n\n\"I have told Lord Fawn that nothing shall induce me ever to see him\nagain.\"\n\n\"And cousin Frank?\"\n\n\"My cousin attends me down to Scotland.\"\n\n\"Oh-h. That makes it altogether another thing. He attends you down to\nScotland;--does he? Does Mr. Emilius go too?\"\n\n\"I believe you are trying to insult me, sir.\"\n\n\"You can't expect but what a man should be a little jealous, when he\nhas been so completely cut out himself. There was a time, you know,\nwhen even cousin Frank wasn't a better fellow than myself.\"\n\n\"Much you thought about it, Lord George.\"\n\n\"Well;--I did. I thought about it a good deal, my lady. And I liked\nthe idea of it very much.\" Lizzie pricked up her ears. In spite of\nall his harshness, could it be that he should be the Corsair still?\n\"I am a rambling, uneasy, ill-to-do sort of man; but still I thought\nabout it. You are pretty, you know,--uncommonly pretty.\"\n\n\"Don't, Lord George.\"\n\n\"And I'll acknowledge that the income goes for much. I suppose that's\nreal at any rate?\"\n\n\"Well;--I hope so. Of course it's real. And so is the prettiness,\nLord George;--if there is any.\"\n\n\"I never doubted that, Lady Eustace. But when it came to my thinking\nthat you had stolen the diamonds, and you thinking that I had stolen\nthe box--! I'm not a man to stand on trifles, but, by George, it\nwouldn't do then.\"\n\n\"Who wanted it to do?\" said Lizzie. \"Go away. You are very unkind to\nme. I hope I may never see you again. I believe you care more for\nthat odious vulgar woman down-stairs than you do for anybody else in\nthe world.\"\n\n\"Ah, dear! I have known her for many years, Lizzie, and that both\ncovers and discovers many faults. One learns to know how bad one's\nold friends are, but then one forgives them, because they are old\nfriends.\"\n\n\"You can't forgive me,--because I'm bad, and only a new friend.\"\n\n\"Yes, I will. I forgive you all, and hope you may do well yet. If\nI may give you one bit of advice at parting, it is to caution you\nagainst being clever when there is nothing to get by it.\"\n\n\"I ain't clever at all,\" said Lizzie, beginning to whimper.\n\n\"Good-bye, my dear.\"\n\n\"Good-bye,\" said Lizzie. He took her hand in one of his; patted her\non the head with the other, as though she had been a child, and then\nhe left her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXVI\n\nLizzie Returns to Scotland\n\n\nFrank Greystock, the writer fears, will not have recommended himself\nto those readers of this tale who think the part of lover to\nthe heroine should be always filled by a young man with heroic\nattributes. And yet the young member for Bobsborough was by no means\ndeficient in fine qualities, and perhaps was quite as capable of\nheroism as the majority of barristers and members of Parliament among\nwhom he consorted, and who were to him--the world. A man born to\ngreat wealth may,--without injury to himself or friends,--do pretty\nnearly what he likes in regard to marriage, always presuming that the\nwife he selects be of his own rank. He need not marry for money, nor\nneed he abstain from marriage because he can't support a wife without\nmoney. And the very poor man, who has no pretension to rank or\nstanding, other than that which honesty may give him, can do the\nsame. His wife's fortune will consist in the labour of her hands, and\nin her ability to assist him in his home. But between these there\nis a middle class of men, who, by reason of their education, are\npeculiarly susceptible to the charms of womanhood, but who literally\ncannot marry for love, because their earnings will do no more\nthan support themselves. As to this special young man, it must be\nconfessed that his earnings should have done much more than that; but\nnot the less did he find himself in a position in which marriage with\na penniless girl seemed to threaten him and her with ruin. All his\nfriends told Frank Greystock that he would be ruined were he to marry\nLucy Morris;--and his friends were people supposed to be very good\nand wise. The dean, and the dean's wife, his father and mother,\nwere very clear that it would be so. Old Lady Linlithgow had spoken\nof such a marriage as quite out of the question. The Bishop of\nBobsborough, when it was mentioned in his hearing, had declared that\nsuch a marriage would be a thousand pities. And even dear old Lady\nFawn, though she wished it for Lucy's sake, had many times prophesied\nthat such a thing was quite impossible. When the rumour of the\nmarriage reached Lady Glencora, Lady Glencora told her friend, Madame\nMax Goesler, that that young man was going to blow his brains out.\nTo her thinking, the two actions were equivalent. It is only when we\nread of such men that we feel that truth to his sweetheart is the\nfirst duty of man. I am afraid that it is not the advice which we\ngive to our sons.\n\nBut it was the advice which Frank Greystock had most persistently\ngiven to himself since he had first known Lucy Morris. Doubtless he\nhad vacillated, but, on the balance of his convictions as to his own\nfuture conduct, he had been much nobler than his friends. He had\nnever hesitated for a moment as to the value of Lucy Morris. She\nwas not beautiful. She had no wonderful gifts of nature. There was\nnothing of a goddess about her. She was absolutely penniless. She had\nnever been what the world calls well-dressed. And yet she had been\neverything to him. There had grown up a sympathy between them quite\nas strong on his part as on hers, and he had acknowledged it to\nhimself. He had never doubted his own love,--and when he had been\nmost near to convincing himself that in his peculiar position he\nought to marry his rich cousin, because of her wealth, then, at those\nmoments, he had most strongly felt that to have Lucy Morris close to\nhim was the greatest charm in existence. Hitherto his cousin's money,\njoined to flatteries and caresses,--which, if a young man can resist,\nhe is almost more than a young man,--had tempted him; but he had\ncombated the temptation. On one memorable evening his love for Lucy\nhad tempted him. To that temptation he had yielded, and the letter by\nwhich he became engaged to her had been written. He had never meant\nto evade it;--had always told himself that it should not be evaded;\nbut, gradually, days had been added to days, and months to months,\nand he had allowed her to languish without seeing him, and almost\nwithout hearing from him.\n\nShe, too, had heard from all sides that she was deserted by him, and\nshe had written to him to give him back his troth; but she had not\nsent her letters. She did not doubt that the thing was over,--she\nhardly doubted. And yet she would not send any letter. Perhaps it\nwould be better that the matter should be allowed to drop without any\nletter-writing. She would never reproach him,--though she would ever\nthink him to be a traitor. Would not she have starved herself for\nhim, could she so have served him? And yet he could bear for her sake\nno touch of delay in his prosperity! Would she not have been content\nto wait, and always to wait,--so that he with some word of love would\nhave told her that he waited also? But he would not only desert\nher,--but would give himself to that false, infamous woman, who was\nso wholly unfitted to be his wife. For Lucy, though to herself she\nwould call him a traitor,--and would think him to be a traitor, still\nregarded him as the best of mankind, as one who, in marrying such a\none as Lizzie Eustace, would destroy all his excellence, as a man\nmight mar his strength and beauty by falling into a pit. For Lizzie\nEustace Lucy Morris had now no forgiveness. Lucy had almost forgotten\nLizzie's lies, and her proffered bribe, and all her meanness, when\nshe made that visit to Hertford Street. Then, when Lizzie claimed\nthis man as her lover, a full remembrance of all the woman's\niniquities came back on Lucy's mind. The statement that Lizzie then\nmade, Lucy did believe. She did think that Frank, her Frank, the man\nwhom she worshipped, was to take this harpy to his bosom as his wife.\nAnd if it were to be so, was it not better that she should be so\ntold? But, from that moment, poor Lizzie's sins were ranker to Lucy\nMorris than even to Mr. Camperdown or Mrs. Hittaway. She could not\nrefrain from saying a word even to old Lady Linlithgow. The countess\nhad called her niece a little liar. \"Liar!\" said Lucy. \"I do not\nthink Satan himself can lie as she does.\" \"Heighty-tighty,\" said the\ncountess. \"I suppose, then, there's to be a match between Lady Satan\nand her cousin Frank?\" \"They can do as they like about that,\" said\nLucy, walking out of the room.\n\nThen came the paragraph in the fashionable evening newspaper; after\nthat, the report of the examination before the magistrate, and\nthen certain information that Lady Eustace was about to proceed to\nScotland together with her cousin Mr. Greystock, the Member for\nBobsborough. \"It is a large income,\" said the countess; \"but, upon my\nword, she's dear at the money.\" Lucy did not speak, but she bit her\nlip till the blood ran into her mouth. She was going down to Fawn\nCourt almost immediately, to stay there with her old friends till she\nshould be able to find some permanent home for herself. Once, and\nonce only, would she endure discussion, and then the matter should be\nbanished for ever from her tongue.\n\nEarly on the appointed morning Frank Greystock, with a couple of\ncabs, was at Mrs. Carbuncle's door in Hertford Street. Lizzie had\nagreed to start by a very early train,--at eight a.m.,--so that\nshe might get through to Portray in one day. It had been thought\nexpedient, both by herself and by her cousin, that for the present\nthere should be no more sleeping at the Carlisle hotel. The robbery\nwas probably still talked about in that establishment; and the report\nof the proceedings at the police-court had, no doubt, travelled as\nfar north as the border city. It was to be a long day, and could\nhardly be other than sad. Lizzie, understanding this, feeling\nthat though she had been in a great measure triumphant over her\ndifficulties before the magistrate, she ought still to consider\nherself, for a short while, as being under a cloud, crept down into\nthe cab and seated herself beside her cousin almost without a word.\nShe was again dressed in black, and again wore the thick veil. Her\nmaid, with the luggage, followed them, and they were driven to Euston\nSquare almost without a word. On this occasion no tall footman\naccompanied them. \"Oh, Frank; dear Frank,\" she had said, and that\nwas all. He had been active about the luggage and useful in giving\norders;--but beyond his directions and inquiries as to the journey,\nhe spoke not a word. Had she breakfasted? Would she have a cup of\ntea at the station? Should he take any luncheon for her? At every\nquestion she only looked into his face and shook her head. All\nthoughts as to creature-comforts were over with her now for ever.\nTranquillity, a little poetry, and her darling boy, were all that she\nneeded for the short remainder of her sojourn upon earth. These were\nthe sentiments which she intended to convey when she shook her head\nand looked up into his eyes. The world was over for her. She had had\nher day of pleasure, and found how vain it was. Now she would devote\nherself to her child. \"I shall see my boy again to-night,\" she said,\nas she took her seat in the carriage.\n\nSuch was the state of mind, or such, rather, the resolutions,\nwith which she commenced her journey. Should he become bright,\ncommunicative, and pleasant, or even tenderly silent, or, perhaps,\nnow at length affectionate and demonstrative, she, no doubt, might be\nable to change as he changed. He had been cousinly, but gloomy, at\nthe police-court; in the same mood when he brought her home; and,\nas she saw with the first glance of her eye, in the same mood again\nwhen she met him in the hall this morning. Of course she must play\nhis tunes. Is it not the fate of women to play the tunes which men\ndictate,--except in some rare case in which the woman can make\nherself the dictator? Lizzie loved to be a dictator; but at the\npresent moment she knew that circumstances were against her.\n\nShe watched him,--so closely. At first he slept a good deal. He was\nnever in bed very early, and on this morning had been up at six. At\nRugby he got out and ate what he said was his breakfast. Would not\nshe have a cup of tea? Again she shook her head and smiled. She\nsmiled as some women smile when you offer them a third glass of\nchampagne. \"You are joking with me, I know. You cannot think that\nI would take it.\" That was the meaning of Lizzie's smile. He went\ninto the refreshment-room, growled at the heat of the tea and the\nabominable nastiness of the food provided, and then, after the\nallotted five minutes, took himself to a smoking-carriage. He did not\nrejoin his cousin till they were at Crewe. When he went back to his\nold seat, she only smiled again. He asked her whether she had slept,\nand again she shook her head. She had been repeating to herself the\naddress to Ianthe's soul, and her whole being was pervaded with\npoetry.\n\nIt was absolutely necessary, as he thought, that she should eat\nsomething, and he insisted that she should dine upon the road,\nsomewhere. He, of course, was not aware that she had been nibbling\nbiscuits and chocolate while he had been smoking, and had had\nrecourse even to the comfort of a sherry-flask which she carried in\nher dressing-bag. When he talked of dinner she did more than smile\nand refuse. She expostulated. For she well knew that the twenty\nminutes for dinner were allowed at the Carlisle station; and even if\nthere had been no chocolate and no sherry, she would have endured\non, even up to absolute inanition, rather than step out upon this\nwell-remembered platform. \"You must eat, or you'll be starved,\" he\nsaid. \"I'll fetch you something.\" So he bribed a special waiter, and\nshe was supplied with cold chicken and more sherry. After this Frank\nsmoked again, and did not reappear till they had reached Dumfries.\n\nHitherto there had been no tenderness,--nothing but the coldest\ncousinship. He clearly meant her to understand that he had submitted\nto the task of accompanying her back to Portray Castle as a duty, but\nthat he had nothing to say to one who had so misbehaved herself. This\nwas very irritating. She could have taken herself home to Portray\nwithout his company, and have made the journey more endurable\nwithout him than with him, if this were to be his conduct throughout.\nThey had had the carriage to themselves all the way from Crewe to\nCarlisle, and he had hardly spoken a word to her. If he would have\nrated her soundly for her wickednesses, she could have made something\nof that. She could have thrown herself on her knees, and implored his\npardon; or, if hard pressed, have suggested the propriety of throwing\nherself out of the carriage-window. She could have brought him round\nif he would only have talked to her, but there is no doing anything\nwith a silent man. He was not her master. He had no power over her.\nShe was the lady of Portray, and he could not interfere with her.\nIf he intended to be sullen with her to the end, and to show his\ncontempt for her, she would turn against him. \"The worm will turn,\"\nshe said to herself. And yet she did not think herself a worm.\n\nA few stations beyond Dumfries they were again alone. It was now\nquite dark, and they had already been travelling over ten hours. They\nwould not reach their own station till eight, and then again there\nwould be the journey to Portray. At last he spoke to her. \"Are you\ntired, Lizzie?\"\n\n\"Oh, so tired!\"\n\n\"You have slept, I think.\"\n\n\"No, not once; not a wink. You have slept.\" This she said in a tone\nof reproach.\n\n\"Indeed I have.\"\n\n\"I have endeavoured to read, but one cannot command one's mind at\nall times. Oh, I am so weary. Is it much further? I have lost all\nreckoning as to time and place.\"\n\n\"We change at the next station but one. It will soon be over now.\nWill you have a glass of sherry? I have some in my flask.\" Again she\nshook her head. \"It is a long way down to Portray, I must own.\"\n\n\"Oh, I am so sorry that I have given you the trouble to accompany\nme.\"\n\n\"I was not thinking of myself. I don't mind it. It was better that\nyou should have somebody with you,--just for this journey.\"\n\n\"I don't know why this journey should be different from any other,\"\nsaid Lizzie crossly. She had not done anything that made it necessary\nthat she should be taken care of,--like a naughty girl.\n\n\"I'll see you to the end of it now, anyway.\"\n\n\"And you'll stay a few days with me, Frank? You won't go away at\nonce? Say you'll stay a week. Dear, dear Frank; say you'll stay a\nweek. I know that the House doesn't meet for ever so long. Oh, Frank,\nI do so wish you'd be more like yourself.\" There was no reason why\nshe should not make one other effort, and as she made it every sign\nof fatigue passed away from her.\n\n\"I'll stay over to-morrow certainly,\" he replied.\n\n\"Only one day!\"\n\n\"Days with me mean money, Lizzie, and money is a thing which is at\npresent very necessary to me.\"\n\n\"I hate money.\"\n\n\"That's very well for you, because you have plenty of it.\"\n\n\"I hate money. It is the only thing that one has that one cannot give\nto those one loves. I could give you anything else;--though it cost a\nthousand pounds.\"\n\n\"Pray don't. Most people like presents, but they only bore me.\"\n\n\"Because you are so indifferent, Frank;--so cold. Do you remember\ngiving me a little ring?\"\n\n\"Very well indeed. It cost eight and sixpence.\"\n\n\"I never thought what it cost;--but there it is.\" This she said,\ndrawing off her glove and showing him her finger. \"And when I am\ndead, there it will be. You say you want money, Frank. May I not give\nit you? Are not we brother and sister?\"\n\n\"My dear Lizzie, you say you hate money. Don't talk about it.\"\n\n\"It is you that talk about it. I only talk about it because I want\nto give it you;--yes, all that I have. When I first knew what was\nthe real meaning of my husband's will, my only thought was to be of\nassistance to you.\"\n\nIn real truth Frank was becoming very sick of her. It seemed to him\nnow to have been almost impossible that he should ever soberly have\nthought of making her his wife. The charm was all gone, and even her\nprettiness had in his eyes lost its value. He looked at her, asking\nhimself whether in truth she was pretty. She had been travelling all\nday, and perhaps the scrutiny was not fair. But he thought that even\nafter the longest day's journey Lucy would not have been soiled,\nhaggard, dishevelled, and unclean, as was this woman.\n\nTravellers again entered the carriage, and they went on with a crowd\nof persons till they reached the platform at which they changed the\ncarriage for Troon. Then they were again alone, for a few minutes,\nand Lizzie with infinite courage determined that she would make her\nlast attempt. \"Frank,\" she said, \"you know what it is that I mean.\nYou cannot feel that I am ungenerous. You have made me love you. Will\nyou have all that I have to give?\" She was leaning over, close to\nhim, and he was observing that her long lock of hair was out of curl\nand untidy,--a thing that ought not to have been there during such a\njourney as this.\n\n\"Do you not know,\" he said, \"that I am engaged to marry Lucy Morris?\"\n\n\"No;--I do not know it.\"\n\n\"I have told you so more than once.\"\n\n\"You cannot afford to marry her.\"\n\n\"Then I shall do it without affording.\" Lizzie was about to\nspeak,--had already pronounced her rival's name in that tone of\ncontempt which she so well knew how to use, when he stopped her. \"Do\nnot say anything against her, Lizzie, in my hearing, for I will not\nbear it. It would force me to leave you at the Troon station, and\nI had better see you now to the end of the journey.\" Lizzie flung\nherself back into the corner of her carriage, and did not utter\nanother word till she reached Portray Castle. He handed her out of\nthe railway carriage, and into her own vehicle which was waiting for\nthem, attended to the maid, and got the luggage; but still she did\nnot speak. It would be better that she should quarrel with him. That\nlittle snake, Lucy, would of course now tell him of the meeting\nbetween them in Hertford Street, after which anything but quarrelling\nwould be impossible. What a fool the man must be, what an idiot, what\na soft-hearted, mean-spirited fellow! Lucy, by her sly, quiet little\nstratagems, had got him once to speak the word, and now he had not\ncourage enough to go back from it! He had less strength of will even\nthan Lord Fawn! What she offered to him would be the making of him.\nWith his position, his seat in Parliament, such a country house as\nPortray Castle, and the income which she would give him, there was\nnothing that he might not reach! And he was so infirm of purpose,\nthat though he had hankered after it all, he would not open his hand\nto take it,--because he was afraid of such a little thing as Lucy\nMorris! It was thus that she thought of him as she leaned back in\nthe carriage without speaking. In giving her all that is due to her,\nwe must acknowledge that she had less feeling of the injury done to\nher charms as a woman than might have been expected. That she hated\nLucy was a matter of course;--and equally so that she should be\nvery angry with Frank Greystock. But the anger arose from general\ndisappointment, rather than from any sense of her own despised\nbeauty. \"Ah, now I shall see my child,\" she said, as the carriage\nstopped at the castle-gate.\n\nWhen Frank Greystock went to his supper, Miss Macnulty brought to him\nhis cousin's compliments with a message saying that she was too weary\nto see him again that night. The message had been intended to be curt\nand uncourteous, but Miss Macnulty had softened it,--so that no harm\nwas done. \"She must be very weary,\" said Frank.\n\n\"I suppose though that nothing would ever really tire Lady Eustace,\"\nsaid Miss Macnulty. \"When she is excited nothing will tire her.\nPerhaps the journey has been dull.\"\n\n\"Exceedingly dull,\" said Frank, as he helped himself to the collops\nwhich the Portray cook had prepared for his supper.\n\nMiss Macnulty was very attentive to him, and had many questions to\nask. About the necklace she hardly dared to speak, merely observing\nhow sad it was that all those precious diamonds should have been lost\nfor ever. \"Very sad indeed,\" said Frank with his mouth full. She then\nwent on to the marriage,--the marriage that was no marriage. Was not\nthat very dreadful? Was it true that Miss Roanoke was really--out of\nher mind? Frank acknowledged that it was dreadful, but thought that\nthe marriage had it been completed would have been more so. As for\nthe young lady, he only knew that she had been taken somewhere out of\nthe way. Sir Griffin, he had been told, had gone to Japan.\n\n\"To Japan!\" said Miss Macnulty, really interested. Had Sir Griffin\ngone no further than Boulogne, her pleasure in the news would\ncertainly have been much less. Then she asked some single question\nabout Lord George, and from that came to the real marrow of her\nanxiety. Had Mr. Greystock lately seen the--the Rev. Mr. Emilius?\nFrank had not seen the clergyman, and could only say of him that had\nLucinda Roanoke and Sir Griffin Tewett been made one, the knot would\nhave been tied by Mr. Emilius.\n\n\"Would it indeed? Did you not think Mr. Emilius very clever when you\nmet him down here?\"\n\n\"I don't doubt but what he is a sharp sort of fellow.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Greystock, I don't think that that's the word for him at\nall. He did promise me when he was here that he would write to\nme occasionally, but I suppose that the increasing duties of his\nposition have rendered that impossible.\" Frank, who had no idea of\nthe extent of the preacher's ambition, assured Miss Macnulty that\namong his multifarious clerical labours it was out of the question\nthat Mr. Emilius should find time to write letters.\n\nFrank had consented to stay one day at Portray, and did not now like\nto run away without again seeing his cousin. Though much tempted to\ngo at once, he did stay the day, and had an opportunity of speaking\na few words to Mr. Gowran. Mr. Gowran was very gracious, but said\nnothing of his journey up to London. He asked various questions\nconcerning her \"leddyship's\" appearance at the police-court, as to\nwhich tidings had already reached Ayrshire, and pretended to be\ngreatly shocked at the loss of the diamonds. \"When they talk o' ten\nthoosand poond, that's a lee, nae doobt?\" asked Andy.\n\n\"No lie at all, I believe,\" said Greystock.\n\n\"And her leddyship wad tak' aboot wi' her ten thoosand poond--in a\nbox?\" Andy still showed much doubt by the angry glance of his eye\nand the close compression of his lips, and the great severity of his\ndemeanour as he asked the question.\n\n\"I know nothing about diamonds myself, but that is what they say they\nwere worth.\"\n\n\"Her leddyship's her ain sell seems nae to ha' been in ain story\naboot the box, Muster Greystock?\" But Frank could not stand to be\ncross-questioned on this delicate matter, and walked off, saying that\nas the thieves had not yet been tried for the robbery, the less said\nabout it the better.\n\nAt four o'clock on that afternoon he had not seen Lizzie, and then\nhe received a message from her to the effect that she was still\nso unwell from the fatigue of her journey that she could bear no\none with her but her child. She hoped that her cousin was quite\ncomfortable, and that she might be able to see him after breakfast\non the following day. But Frank was determined to leave Portray very\nearly on the following day, and therefore wrote a note to his cousin.\nHe begged that she would not disturb herself, that he would leave the\ncastle the next morning before she could be up, and that he had only\nfurther to remind her that she must come up to London at once as\nsoon as she should be summoned for the trial of Mr. Benjamin and his\ncomrade. It had seemed to Frank that she had almost concluded that\nher labours connected with that disagreeable matter were at an end.\n\"The examination may be long, and I will attend you if you wish it,\"\nsaid her cousin. Upon receiving this she thought it expedient to come\ndown to him, and there was an interview for about a quarter of an\nhour in her own little sitting-room looking out upon the sea. She\nhad formed a project, and at once suggested it to him. If she found\nherself ill when the day of the trial came, could they make her go up\nand give her evidence? Frank told her that they could, and that they\nwould. She was very clever about it. \"They couldn't go back to what\nI said at Carlisle, you know; because they already have made me tell\nall that myself.\" As she had been called upon to criminate herself,\nshe could not now be tried for the crime. Frank, however, would not\nlisten to this, and told her that she must come. \"Very well, Frank. I\nknow you like to have your own way. You always did. And you think so\nlittle of my feelings! I shall make inquiry, and if I must,--why I\nsuppose I must.\"\n\n\"You'd better make up your mind to come.\"\n\n\"Very well. And now, Frank, as I am so very tired, if you please I'll\nsay good-bye to you. I am very much obliged to you for coming with\nme. Good-bye.\" And so they parted.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXVII\n\nThe Story of Lucy Morris Is Concluded\n\n\nOn the day appointed, Lucy Morris went back from the house of the old\ncountess to Fawn Court. \"My dear,\" said Lady Linlithgow, \"I am sorry\nthat you are going. Perhaps you'll think I haven't been very kind to\nyou, but I never am kind. People have always been hard to me, and I'm\nhard. But I do like you.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you like me, as we have lived together so long.\"\n\n\"You may go on staying here, if you choose, and I'll try to make it\nbetter.\"\n\n\"It hasn't been bad at all,--only that there's nothing particular\nto do. But I must go. I shall get another place as a governess\nsomewhere, and that will suit me best.\"\n\n\"Because of the money, you mean.\"\n\n\"Well;--that in part.\"\n\n\"I mean to pay you something,\" said the countess, opening her\npocket-book, and fumbling for two bank-notes which she had deposited\nthere.\n\n\"Oh, dear, no. I haven't earned anything.\"\n\n\"I always gave Macnulty something, and she was not near so nice as\nyou.\" And then the countess produced two ten-pound notes. But Lucy\nwould have none of her money, and when she was pressed, became proud\nand almost indignant in her denial. She had earned nothing, and she\nwould take nothing; and it was in vain that the old lady spread the\nclean bits of paper before her. \"And so you'll go and be a governess\nagain; will you?\"\n\n\"When I can get a place.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what, my dear. If I were Frank Greystock, I'd stick to\nmy bargain.\" Lucy at once fell a-crying, but she smiled upon the old\nwoman through her tears. \"Of course he's going to marry that little\nlimb of the devil.\"\n\n\"Oh, Lady Linlithgow,--if you can, prevent that!\"\n\n\"How am I to prevent it, my dear? I've nothing to say to either of\nthem.\"\n\n\"It isn't for myself I'm speaking. If I can't--if I can't--can't have\nthings go as I thought they would by myself, I will never ask any one\nto help me. It is not that I mean. I have given all that up.\"\n\n\"You have given it up?\"\n\n\"Yes;--I have. But nevertheless I think of him. She is bad, and he\nwill never be happy if he marries her. When he asked me to be his\nwife, he was mistaken as to what would be good for him. He ought not\nto have made such a mistake. For my sake he ought not.\"\n\n\"That's quite true, my dear.\"\n\n\"But I do not wish him to be unhappy all his life. He is not bad, but\nshe is very bad. I would not for worlds that anybody should tell him\nthat he owed me anything; but if he could be saved from her,--oh, I\nshould be so-glad.\"\n\n\"You won't have my money, then?\"\n\n\"No,--Lady Linlithgow.\"\n\n\"You'd better. It is honestly your own.\"\n\n\"I will not take it, thank you.\"\n\n\"Then I may as well put it up again.\" And the countess replaced the\nnotes in her pocket-book. When this conversation took place, Frank\nGreystock was travelling back alone from Portray to London. On the\nsame day the Fawn carriage came to fetch Lucy away. As Lucy was in\npeculiar distress, Lady Fawn would not allow her to come by any\nother conveyance. She did not exactly think that the carriage would\nconsole her poor favourite; but she did it as she would have ordered\nsomething specially nice to eat for any one who had broken his leg.\nHer soft heart had compassion for misery, though she would sometimes\nshow her sympathy by strange expressions. Lady Linlithgow was almost\nangry about the carriage. \"How many carriages and how many horses\ndoes Lady Fawn keep?\" she asked.\n\n\"One carriage and two horses.\"\n\n\"She's very fond of sending them up into the streets of London, I\nthink.\" Lucy said nothing more, knowing that it would be impossible\nto soften the heart of this dowager in regard to the other. But she\nkissed the old woman at parting, and then was taken down to Richmond\nin state.\n\nShe had made up her mind to have one discussion with Lady Fawn\nabout her engagement,--the engagement which was no longer an\nengagement,--and then to have done with it. She would ask Lady\nFawn to ask the girls never to mention Mr. Greystock's name in her\nhearing. Lady Fawn had also made up her mind to the same effect.\nShe felt that the subject should be mentioned once,--and once only.\nOf course Lucy must have another place, but there need be no hurry\nabout that. She fully recognised her young friend's feeling of\nindependence, and was herself aware that she would be wrong to offer\nto the girl a permanent home among her own daughters, and therefore\nshe could not abandon the idea of a future place; but Lucy would, of\ncourse, remain till a situation should have been found for her that\nwould be in every sense unexceptionable. There need, however, be no\nhaste,--and, in the meantime, the few words about Frank Greystock\nmust be spoken. They need not, however, be spoken quite immediately.\nLet there be smiles, and joy, and a merry ring of laughter on this\nthe first day of the return of their old friend. As Lucy had the same\nfeelings on that afternoon, they did talk pleasantly and were merry.\nThe girls asked questions about the Vulturess,--as they had heard her\ncalled by Lizzie Eustace,--and laughed at Lucy to her face when she\nswore that, after a fashion, she liked the old woman.\n\n\"You'd like anybody, then,\" said Nina.\n\n\"Indeed I don't,\" said Lucy, thinking at once of Lizzie Eustace.\n\nLady Fawn planned out the next day with great precision. After\nbreakfast, Lucy and the girls were to spend the morning in the old\nschool-room, so that there might be a general explanation as to the\ndoings of the last six months. They were to dine at three, and after\ndinner there should be the discussion. \"Will you come up to my room\nat four o'clock, my dear?\" said Lady Fawn, patting Lucy's shoulder,\nin the breakfast-parlour. Lucy knew well why her presence was\nrequired. Of course she would come. It would be wise to get it over\nand have done with it.\n\nAt noon Lady Fawn, with her three eldest daughters, went out in the\ncarriage, and Lucy was busy among the others with books and maps and\nsheets of scribbled music. Nothing was done on that day in the way\nof instruction; but there was much of half-jocose acknowledgement of\npast idleness, and a profusion of resolutions of future diligence.\nOne or two of the girls were going to commence a course of reading\nthat would have broken the back of any professor, and suggestions\nwere made as to very rigid rules as to the talking of French and\nGerman. \"But as we can't talk German,\" said Nina, \"we should simply\nbe dumb.\" \"You'd talk High Dutch, Nina, sooner than submit to that,\"\nsaid one of the sisters.\n\nThe conclave was still sitting in full deliberation, when one of the\nmaids entered the room with a very long face. There was a gentleman\nin the drawing-room asking for Miss Morris! Lucy, who at the moment\nwas standing at a table on which were spread an infinity of books,\nbecame at once as white as a sheet. Her fast friend, Lydia Fawn, who\nwas standing by her, immediately took hold of her hand quite tightly.\nThe face of the maid was fit for a funeral. She knew that Miss Morris\nhad had a \"follower,\"--that the follower had come,--and that then\nMiss Morris had gone away. Miss Morris had been allowed to come back;\nand now, on the very first day, just when my lady's back was turned,\nhere was the follower again! Before she had come up with her message,\nthere had been an unanimous expression of opinion in the kitchen that\nthe fat would all be in the fire. Lucy was as white as marble, and\nfelt such a sudden shock at her heart, that she could not speak. And\nyet she never doubted for a moment that Frank Greystock was the man.\nAnd with what purpose but one could he have come there? She had on\nthe old, old frock in which, before her visit to Lady Linlithgow,\nshe used to pass the morning amidst her labours with the girls,--a\npale, grey, well-worn frock, to which must have been imparted some\nattraction from the milliner's art, because everybody liked it so\nwell,--but which she had put on this very morning as a testimony, to\nall the world around her, that she had abandoned the idea of being\nanything except a governess. Lady Fawn had understood the frock well.\n\"Here is the dear little old woman just the same as ever,\" Lydia had\nsaid, embracing her. \"She looks as if she'd gone to bed before the\nwinter, and had a long sleep, like a dormouse,\" said Cecilia. Lucy\nhad liked it all, and thoroughly appreciated the loving-kindness; but\nshe had known what it all meant. She had left them as the engaged\nbride of Mr. Greystock, the member for Bobsborough; and now she had\ncome back as Lucy Morris, the governess, again. \"Just the same as\never,\" Lucy had said, with the sweetest smile. They all understood\nthat, in so saying, she renounced her lover.\n\nAnd now there stood the maid, inside the room, who, having announced\nthat there was a gentleman asking for Miss Morris, was waiting for an\nanswer. Was the follower to be sent about his business, with a flea\nin his ear, having come, slyly, craftily, and wickedly, in Lady\nFawn's absence; or would Miss Morris brazen it out, and go and see\nhim?\n\n\"Who is the gentleman?\" asked Diana, who was the eldest of the Fawn\ngirls present.\n\n\"It's he as used to come after Miss Morris before,\" said the maid.\n\n\"It is Mr. Greystock,\" said Lucy, recovering herself with an effort.\n\"I had better go down to him. Will you tell him, Mary, that I'll be\nwith him almost immediately?\"\n\n\"You ought to have put on the other frock, after all,\" said Nina,\nwhispering into her ear.\n\n\"He has not lost much time in coming to see you,\" said Lydia.\n\n\"I suppose it was all because he didn't like Lady Linlithgow,\" said\nCecilia. Lucy had not a word to say. She stood for a minute among\nthem, trying to think, and then she slowly left the room.\n\nShe would not condescend to alter her dress by the aid of a single\npin, or by the adjustment of a ribbon. It might well be that, after\nthe mingled work and play of the morning, her hair should not be\nsmooth; but she was too proud to look at her hair. The man whom she\nhad loved, who had loved her but had neglected her, was in the house.\nHe would surely not have followed her thither did he not intend\nto make reparation for his neglect. But she would use no art with\nhim;--nor would she make any entreaty. It might be that, after all,\nhe had the courage to come and tell her, in a manly, straightforward\nway, that the thing must be all over,--that he had made a mistake,\nand would beg her pardon. If it were so, there should be no word of\nreproach. She would be quite quiet with him; but there should be no\nword of reproach. But if-- In that other case she could not be sure\nof her behaviour, but she knew well that he would not have to ask\nlong for forgiveness. As for her dress,--he had chosen to love her\nin that frock before, and she did not think that he would pay much\nattention to her dress on the present occasion.\n\nShe opened the door very quietly and very slowly, intending to\napproach him in the same way. But in a moment, before she could\nremember that she was in the room, he had seized her in his arms, and\nwas showering kisses upon her forehead, her eyes, and her lips. When\nshe thought of it afterwards, she could not call to mind a single\nword that he had spoken before he held her in his embrace. It was\nshe, surely, who had spoken first, when she begged to be released\nfrom his pressure. But she well remembered the first words that\nstruck her ear. \"Dearest Lucy, will you forgive me?\" She could only\nanswer them through her tears by taking up his hand and kissing it.\n\nWhen Lady Fawn came back with the carriage, she herself saw the\nfigures of two persons, walking very close together, in the\nshrubberies. \"Is that Lucy?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Augusta, with a tone of horror. \"Indeed it is, and--Mr.\nGreystock.\"\n\nLady Fawn was neither shocked nor displeased; nor was she\ndisappointed; but a certain faint feeling of being ill-used by\ncircumstances came over her. \"Dear me;--the very first day!\" she\nsaid.\n\n\"It's because he wouldn't go to Lady Linlithgow's,\" said Amelia. \"He\nhas only waited, mamma.\"\n\n\"But the very first day!\" exclaimed Lady Fawn. \"I hope Lucy will be\nhappy;--that's all.\"\n\nThere was a great meeting of all the Fawns, as soon as Lady Fawn and\nthe eldest girls were in the house. Mr. Greystock had been walking\nabout the grounds with Lucy for the last hour and a half. Lucy had\ncome in once to beg that Lady Fawn might be told directly she came\nin. \"She said you were to send for her, mamma,\" said Lydia.\n\n\"But it's dinner-time, my dear. What are we to do with Mr.\nGreystock?\"\n\n\"Ask him to lunch, of course,\" said Amelia.\n\n\"I suppose it's all right,\" said Lady Fawn.\n\n\"I'm quite sure it's all right,\" said Nina.\n\n\"What did she say to you, Lydia?\" asked the mother.\n\n\"She was as happy as ever she could be,\" said Lydia. \"There's no\ndoubt about its being all right, mamma. She looked just as she did\nwhen she got the letter from him before.\"\n\n\"I hope she managed to change her frock,\" said Augusta.\n\n\"She didn't then,\" said Cecilia.\n\n\"I don't suppose he cares one halfpenny about her frock,\" said Nina.\n\"I should never think about a man's coat if I was in love.\"\n\n\"Nina, you shouldn't talk in that way,\" said Augusta. Whereupon Nina\nmade a face behind one of her sisters' backs. Poor Augusta was never\nallowed to be a prophetess among them.\n\nThe consultation was ended by a decision in accordance with which\nNina went as an ambassador to the lovers. Lady Fawn sent her\ncompliments to Mr. Greystock, and hoped he would come in to lunch.\nLucy must come in to dinner, because dinner was ready. \"And mamma\nwants to see you just for a minute,\" added Nina, in a pretended\nwhisper.\n\n\"Oh, Nina, you darling girl!\" said Lucy, kissing her young friend in\nan ecstasy of joy.\n\n\"It's all right?\" asked Nina in a whisper which was really intended\nfor privacy. Lucy did not answer the question otherwise than by\nanother kiss.\n\nFrank Greystock was, of course, obliged to take his seat at the\ntable, and was entertained with a profusion of civility. Everybody\nknew that he had behaved badly to Lucy,--everybody, except Lucy\nherself, who, from this time forward, altogether forgot that she had\nfor some time looked upon him as a traitor, and had made up her mind\nthat she had been deceived and ill-used. All the Fawns had spoken\nof him, in Lucy's absence, in the hardest terms of reproach, and\ndeclared that he was not fit to be spoken to by any decent person.\nLady Fawn had known from the first that such a one as he was not to\nbe trusted. Augusta had never liked him. Amelia had feared that poor\nLucy Morris had been unwise, and too ambitious. Georgina had seen\nthat, of course, it would never do. Diana had sworn that it was a\ngreat shame. Lydia was sure that Lucy was a great deal too good for\nhim. Cecilia had wondered where he would go to;--a form of anathema\nwhich had brought down a rebuke from her mother. And Nina had always\nhated him like poison. But now nothing was too good for him. An\nunmarried man who is willing to sacrifice himself is, in feminine\neyes, always worthy of ribbons and a chaplet. Among all these Fawns\nthere was as little selfishness as can be found,--even among women.\nThe lover was not the lover of one of themselves, but of their\ngoverness. And yet, though he desired neither to eat nor drink at\nthat hour, something special had been cooked for him, and a special\nbottle of wine had been brought out of the cellar. All his sins were\nforgiven him. No single question was asked as to his gross misconduct\nduring the last six months. No pledge or guarantee was demanded for\nthe future. There he was, in the guise of a declared lover, and the\nfatted calf was killed.\n\nAfter this early dinner it was necessary that he should return to\ntown, and Lucy obtained leave to walk with him to the station. To her\nthinking now, there was no sin to be forgiven. Everything was, and\nhad been, just as it ought to be. Had any human being hinted that he\nhad sinned, she would have defended him to the death. Something was\nsaid between them about Lizzie, but nothing that arose from jealousy.\nNot till many months had passed did she tell him of Lizzie's message\nto herself, and of her visit to Hertford Street. But they spoke of\nthe necklace, and poor Lucy shuddered as she was told the truth about\nthose false oaths. \"I really do think that, after that, Lord Fawn is\nright,\" she said, looking round at her lover. \"Yes; but what he did,\nhe did before that,\" said Frank. \"But are they not good and kind?\"\nshe said, pleading for her friends. \"Was ever anybody so well treated\nas they have treated me? I'll tell you what, sir, you mustn't quarrel\nwith Lord Fawn any more. I won't allow it.\" Then she walked back from\nthe station alone, almost bewildered by her own happiness.\n\nThat evening something like an explanation was demanded by Lady Fawn,\nbut no explanation was forthcoming. When questions were asked about\nhis silence, Lucy, half in joke and half in earnest, fired up and\ndeclared that everything had been as natural as possible. He could\nnot have come to Lady Linlithgow's house. Lady Linlithgow would not\nreceive him. No doubt she had been impatient, but then that had been\nher fault. Had he not come to her the very first day after her return\nto Richmond? When Augusta said something as to letters which might\nhave been written, Lucy snubbed her. \"Who says he didn't write? He\ndid write. If I am contented, why should you complain?\" \"Oh, I don't\ncomplain,\" said Augusta.\n\nThen questions were asked as to the future,--questions to which Lady\nFawn had a right to demand an answer. What did Mr. Greystock propose\nto do now? Then Lucy broke down, sobbing, crying, triumphing, with\nmingled love and happiness. She was to go to the deanery. Frank had\nbrought with him a little note to her from his mother, in which she\nwas invited to make the deanery at Bobsborough her home for the\npresent.\n\n\"And you are to go away just when you've come?\" asked Nina.\n\n\"Stay with us a month, my dear,\" said Lady Fawn, \"just to let people\nknow that we are friends, and after that the deanery will be the best\nhome for you.\" And so it was arranged.\n\n     *     *     *     *     *\n\nIt need only be further said, in completing the history of Lucy\nMorris as far as it can be completed in these pages, that she did\ngo to the deanery, and that there she was received with all the\naffection which Mrs. Greystock could show to an adopted daughter. Her\nquarrel had never been with Lucy personally,--but with the untoward\nfact that her son would not marry money. At the deanery she remained\nfor fifteen happy months, and then became Mrs. Greystock, with a bevy\nof Fawn bridesmaids around her. As the personages of a chronicle such\nas this should all be made to operate backwards and forwards on each\nother from the beginning to the end, it would have been desirable\nthat the chronicler should have been able to report that the ceremony\nwas celebrated by Mr. Emilius. But as the wedding did not take place\ntill the end of the summer, and as Mr. Emilius at that time never\nremained in town, after the season was over, this was impossible. It\nwas the Dean of Bobsborough, assisted by one of the minor canons, who\nperformed the service.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXVIII\n\nThe Trial\n\n\nHaving told the tale of Lucy Morris to the end, the chronicler must\nnow go back to the more important persons of this history. It was\nstill early in April when Lizzie Eustace was taken down to Scotland\nby her cousin, and the trial of Mr. Benjamin and Mr. Smiler was fixed\nto take place at the Central Criminal Court about the middle of May.\nEarly in May the attorneys for the prosecution applied to Greystock,\nasking him whether he would make arrangements for his cousin's\nappearance on the occasion, informing him that she had already been\nformally summoned. Whereupon he wrote to Lizzie, telling her what\nshe had better do, in the kindest manner,--as though there had been\nno cessation of their friendly intercourse, offering to go with her\ninto court,--and naming an hotel at which he would advise her to\nstay during the very short time that she need remain in London. She\nanswered this letter at once. She was sorry to say that she was much\ntoo ill to travel, or even to think of travelling. Such was her\npresent condition that she doubted greatly whether she would ever\nagain be able to leave the two rooms to which she was at present\nconfined. All that remained to her in life was to watch her own blue\nwaves from the casement of her dear husband's castle,--that casement\nat which he had loved to sit, and to make herself happy in the smiles\nof her child. A few months would see the last of it all, and then,\nperhaps, they who had trampled her to death would feel some pangs of\nremorse as they thought of her early fate. She had given her evidence\nonce and had told all the truth,--though she was now aware that she\nneed not have done so, as she had been defrauded of a vast amount of\nproperty through the gross negligence of the police. She was advised\nnow by persons who seemed really to understand the law, that she\ncould recover the value of the diamonds which her dear, dear husband\nhad given her, from the freeholders of the parish in which the\nrobbery had taken place. She feared that her health did not admit of\nthe necessary exertion. Were it otherwise she would leave no stone\nunturned to recover the value of her property,--not on account of its\nvalue, but because she had been so ill-treated by Mr. Camperdown and\nthe police. Then she added a postscript to say that it was quite out\nof the question that she should take any journey for the next six\nmonths.\n\nThe reader need hardly be told that Greystock did not believe a word\nof what she said. He felt sure that she was not ill. There was an\nenergy in the letter hardly compatible with illness. But he could\nnot make her come. He certainly did not intend to go down again to\nScotland to fetch her,--and even had he done so he could not have\nforced her to accompany him. He could only go to the attorneys\nconcerned, and read to them so much of the letter as he thought fit\nto communicate to them. \"That won't do at all,\" said an old gentleman\nat the head of the firm. \"She has been very leniently treated, and\nshe must come.\"\n\n\"You must manage it, then,\" said Frank.\n\n\"I hope she won't give us trouble, because if she does we must expose\nher,\" said the second member.\n\n\"She has not even sent a medical certificate,\" said the tyro of the\nfirm, who was not quite so sharp as he will probably become when he\nhas been a member of it for ten or twelve years. You should never ask\nthe ostler whether he greases his oats. In this case Frank Greystock\nwas not exactly in the position of the ostler; but he did inform\nhis cousin by letter that she would lay herself open to all manner\nof pains and penalties if she disobeyed such a summons as she had\nreceived, unless she did so by a very strong medical advice, backed\nby a medical certificate.\n\nLizzie, when she received this, had two strings to her bow. A\nwriter from Ayr had told her that the summons sent to her was not\nworth the paper on which it was printed in regard to a resident in\nScotland;--and she had also got a doctor from the neighbourhood\nwho was satisfied that she was far too ill to travel up to London.\nPulmonary debilitation was the complaint from which she was\nsuffering, which, with depressed vitality in all the organs, and\nundue languor in all the bodily functions, would be enough to bring\nher to a speedy end if she so much as thought of making a journey\nup to London. A certificate to this effect was got in triplicate.\nOne copy she sent to the attorneys, one to Frank, and one she kept\nherself.\n\nThe matter was very pressing indeed. It was considered that the\ntrial could not be postponed till the next sitting at the Criminal\nCourt, because certain witnesses in respect to the diamonds had been\nprocured from Hamburg and Vienna, at a very great cost; they were\nactually on their way to London when Lizzie's second letter was\nreceived. Mr. Camperdown had resolved to have the diamonds, still\nwith a hope that they might be restored to the keeping of Messrs.\nGarnett, there to lie hidden and unused at any rate for the next\ntwenty years. The diamonds had been traced first to Hamburg, and then\nto Vienna;--and it was to be proved that they were now adorning the\nbosom of a certain enormously rich Russian princess. From the grasp\nof the Russian princess it was found impossible to rescue them; but\nthe witnesses who, as it was hoped, might have aided Mr. Camperdown\nin his efforts, were to be examined at the trial.\n\nA confidential clerk was sent down to Portray, but the confidential\nclerk altogether failed in making his way into Lizzie's presence.\nWord was brought to him that nothing but force could take Lady\nEustace from her bed-chamber; and that force used to that effect\nmight take her out dead, but certainly not alive. He made inquiry,\nhowever, about the doctor, and found that he certainly was a doctor.\nIf a doctor will certify that a lady is dying, what can any judge\ndo, or any jury? There are certain statements which, though they are\nfalse as hell, must be treated as though they were true as gospel.\nThe clerk reported, when he got back to London, that, to his belief,\nLady Eustace was enjoying an excellent state of health;--but that he\nwas perfectly certain that she would not appear as a witness at the\ntrial.\n\nThe anger felt by many persons as to Lizzie's fraudulent obstinacy\nwas intense. Mr. Camperdown thought that she ought to be dragged up\nto London by cart ropes. The attorneys engaged for the prosecution\nwere almost beside themselves. They did send down a doctor of their\nown, but Lizzie would not see the doctor,--would not see the doctor\nthough threats of most frightful consequences were conveyed to her.\nShe would be exposed, fined thousands of pounds, committed to gaol\nfor contempt of court, and prosecuted for perjury into the bargain.\nBut she was firm. She wrote one scrap of a note to the doctor\nwho came from London, \"I shall not live to satisfy their rabid\nvengeance.\" Even Frank Greystock felt almost more annoyed than\ngratified that she should be able thus to escape. People who had\nheard of the inquiry before the magistrate, had postponed their\nexcitement and interest on the occasion, because they knew that\nthe day of the trial would be the great day; and when they heard\nthat they were to be robbed of the pleasure of Lady Eustace's\ncross-examination, there arose almost a public feeling of wrath\nthat justice should be thus outraged. The doctor who had given the\ncertificate was vilified in the newspapers, and long articles were\nwritten as to the impotence of the law. But Lizzie was successful,\nand the trial went on without her.\n\nIt appeared that though her evidence was very desirable it was not\nabsolutely essential, as, in consequence of her certified illness,\nthe statement which she had made at the police-court could be brought\nup and used against the prisoners. All the facts of the robbery\nwere, moreover, proved by Patience Crabstick and Billy Cann; and the\ntransfer of the diamonds by Mr. Benjamin to the man who recut them at\nHamburg was also proved. Many other morsels of collateral evidence\nhad also been picked up by the police,--so that there was no possible\ndoubt as to any detail of the affair in Hertford Street. There was a\nrumour that Mr. Benjamin intended to plead guilty. He might, perhaps,\nhave done so had it not been for the absence of Lady Eustace; but as\nthat was thought to give him a possible chance of escape, he stood\nhis ground.\n\nLizzie's absence was a great disappointment to the sight-seers of\nLondon, but nevertheless the court was crowded. It was understood\nthat the learned serjeant who was retained on this occasion to defend\nMr. Benjamin, and who was assisted by the acute gentleman who had\nappeared before the magistrate, would be rather severe upon Lady\nEustace, even in her absence; and that he would ground his demand for\nan acquittal on the combined facts of her retention of the diamonds,\nher perjury, and of her obstinate refusal to come forward on the\npresent occasion. As it was known that he could be very severe, many\ncame to hear him,--and they were not disappointed. The reader shall\nsee a portion of his address to the jury,--which we hope may have\nhad some salutary effect on Lizzie, as she read it in her retreat at\nPortray, looking out upon her own blue waves.\n\n\"And now, gentlemen of the jury, let me recapitulate to you the\nhistory of this lady as far as it relates to the diamonds as to which\nmy client is now in jeopardy. You have heard on the testimony of Mr.\nCamperdown that they were not hers at all,--that, at any rate, they\nwere not supposed to be hers by those in whose hands was left the\nadministration of her husband's estate, and that when they were first\nsupposed to have been stolen at the inn at Carlisle, he had already\ncommenced legal steps for the recovery of them from her clutches. A\nbill in Chancery had been filed because she had obstinately refused\nto allow them to pass out of her hands. It has been proved to you\nby Lord Fawn that though he was engaged to marry her, he broke his\nengagement because he supposed her possession of these diamonds to be\nfraudulent and dishonest.\" This examination had been terrible to the\nunfortunate Under-Secretary;--and had absolutely driven him away from\nthe India Board and from Parliament for a month. \"It has been proved\nto you that when the diamonds were supposed to have vanished at\nCarlisle, she there committed perjury. That she did so she herself\nstated on oath in that evidence which she gave before the magistrate\nwhen my client was committed, and which has, as I maintain,\nimproperly and illegally been used against my client at this trial.\"\nHere the judge looked over his spectacles and admonished the learned\nserjeant, that his argument on that subject had already been heard,\nand the matter decided. \"True, my lord; but my conviction of my duty\nto my client compels me to revert to it. Lady Eustace committed\nperjury at Carlisle, having the diamonds in her pocket at the very\nmoment in which she swore that they had been stolen from her. And\nif justice had really been done in this case, gentlemen, it is\nLady Eustace who should now be on her trial before you, and not my\nunfortunate client. Well,--what is the next that we hear of it? It\nseems that she brought the diamonds up to London; but how long she\nkept them there, nobody knows. It was, however, necessary to account\nfor them. A robbery is got up between a young woman who seems to have\nbeen the confidential friend rather than the maid of Lady Eustace,\nand that other witness whom you have heard testifying against\nhimself, and who is, of all the informers that ever came into my\nhands, the most flippant, the most hardened, the least conscientious,\nand the least credible. That they two were engaged in a conspiracy\nI cannot doubt. That Lady Eustace was engaged with them, I will not\nsay. But I will ask you to consider whether such may not probably\nhave been the case. At any rate, she then perjures herself again. She\ngives a list of the articles stolen from her, and omits the diamonds.\nShe either perjures herself a second time,--or else the diamonds, in\nregard to which my client is in jeopardy, were not in the house at\nall, and could not then have been stolen. It may very probably have\nbeen so. Nothing more probable. Mr. Camperdown and the managers of\nthe Eustace estate had gradually come to a belief that the Carlisle\nrobbery was a hoax,--and, therefore, another robbery is necessary\nto account for the diamonds. Another robbery is arranged, and this\nyoung and beautiful widow, as bold as brass, again goes before the\nmagistrate and swears. Either the diamonds were not stolen, or else\nagain she commits a second perjury.\n\n\"And now, gentlemen, she is not here. She is sick forsooth at her own\ncastle in Scotland, and sends to us a medical certificate. But the\ngentlemen who are carrying on the prosecution know their witness, and\ndon't believe a word of her sickness. Had she the feelings of woman\nin her bosom she ought indeed to be sick unto death. But they know\nher better, and send down a doctor of their own. You have heard his\nevidence,--and yet this wonderful lady is not before us. I say again\nthat she ought to be here in that dock,--in that dock in spite of her\nfortune, in that dock in spite of her title, in that dock in spite of\nher castle, her riches, her beauty, and her great relatives. A most\nwonderful woman, indeed, is the widow Eustace. It is she whom public\nopinion will convict as the guilty one in this marvellous mass of\nconspiracy and intrigue. In her absence, and after what she has done\nherself, can you convict any man either of stealing or of disposing\nof these diamonds?\" The vigour, the attitude, and the indignant tone\nof the man were more even than his words;--but, nevertheless, the\njury did find both Benjamin and Smiler guilty, and the judge did\nsentence them to penal servitude for fifteen years.\n\nAnd this was the end of the Eustace diamonds as far as anything was\never known of them in England. Mr. Camperdown altogether failed, even\nin his attempt to buy them back at something less than their value,\nand was ashamed himself to look at the figures when he found how much\nmoney he had wasted for his clients in their pursuit. In discussing\nthe matter afterwards with Mr. Dove, he excused himself by asserting\nhis inability to see so gross a robbery perpetrated by a little minx\nunder his very eyes without interfering with the plunder. \"I knew\nwhat she was,\" he said, \"from the moment of Sir Florian's unfortunate\nmarriage. He had brought a little harpy into the family, and I was\nobliged to declare war against her.\" Mr. Dove seemed to be of opinion\nthat the ultimate loss of the diamonds was upon the whole desirable,\nas regarded the whole community. \"I should like to have had the case\nsettled as to right of possession,\" he said, \"because there were in\nit one or two points of interest. We none of us know, for instance,\nwhat a man can, or what a man cannot, give away by a mere word.\"\n\n\"No such word was ever spoken,\" said Mr. Camperdown in wrath.\n\n\"Such evidence as there is would have gone to show that it had been\nspoken. But the very existence of such property so to be disposed of,\nor so not to be disposed of, is in itself an evil. Thus, we have had\nto fight for six months about a lot of stones hardly so useful as the\nflags in the street, and then they vanish from us, leaving us nothing\nto repay us for our labour.\" All which Mr. Camperdown did not quite\nunderstand. Mr. Dove would be paid for his labour,--as to which,\nhowever, Mr. Camperdown knew well that no human being was more\nindifferent than Mr. Dove.\n\nThere was much sorrow, too, among the police. They had no doubt\nsucceeded in sending two scoundrels out of the social world, probably\nfor life, and had succeeded in avoiding the reproach which a great\nrobbery, unaccounted for, always entails upon them. But it was sad to\nthem that the property should altogether have been lost, and sad also\nthat they should have been constrained to allow Billy Cann to escape\nout of their hands. Perhaps the sadness may have been lessened to a\ncertain degree in the breast of the great Mr. Gager by the charms\nand graces of Patience Crabstick, to whom he kept his word by making\nher his wife. This fact,--or rather the prospect of this fact, as it\nthen was,--had also come to the knowledge of the learned serjeant,\nand, in his hands, had served to add another interest to the trial.\nMr. Gager, when examined on the subject, did not attempt to deny\nthe impeachment, and expressed a strong opinion that, though Miss\nCrabstick had given way to temptation under the wiles of the Jew, she\nwould make an honest and an excellent wife. In which expectation let\nus trust that he may not be deceived.\n\nAmusement had, indeed, been expected from other sources which failed.\nMrs. Carbuncle had been summoned, and Lord George; but both of them\nhad left town before the summons could reach them. It was rumoured\nthat Mrs. Carbuncle, with her niece, had gone to join her husband\nat New York. At any rate, she disappeared altogether from London,\nleaving behind her an amount of debts which showed how extremely\nliberal in their dealings the great tradesmen of London will\noccasionally be. There were milliners' bills which had been running\nfor three years, and horse-dealers had given her credit year after\nyear, though they had scarcely ever seen the colour of her money.\nOne account, however, she had honestly settled. The hotel-keeper in\nAlbemarle Street had been paid, and all the tribute had been packed\nand carried off from the scene of the proposed wedding banquet. What\nbecame of Lord George for the next six months, nobody ever knew; but\nhe appeared at Melton in the following November, and I do not know\nthat any one dared to ask him questions about the Eustace diamonds.\n\nOf Lizzie, and her future career, something further must be said in\nthe concluding chapters of this work. She has been our heroine, and\nwe must see her through her immediate troubles before we can leave\nher; but it may be as well to mention here, that although many\nthreats had been uttered against her, not only by Mr. Camperdown and\nthe other attorneys, but even by the judge himself, no punishment at\nall was inflicted upon her in regard to her recusancy, nor was any\nattempt made to punish her. The affair was over, and men were glad\nto avoid the necessity of troubling themselves further with the\nbusiness. It was said that a case would be got up with the view of\nproving that she had not been ill at all, and that the Scotch doctor\nwould be subjected to the loss of his degree, or whatever privileges\nin the healing art belonged to him;--but nothing was done, and Lizzie\ntriumphed in her success.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXIX\n\nOnce More at Portray\n\n\nOn the very day of the trial Mr. Emilius travelled from London to\nKilmarnock. The trial took place on a Monday, so that he had at his\ncommand an entire week before he would be required to appear again\nin his church. He had watched the case against Benjamin and Smiler\nvery closely, and had known beforehand, almost with accuracy, what\nwitnesses would appear and what would not at the great coming event\nat the Old Bailey. When he first heard of Lady Eustace's illness, he\nwrote to her a most affectionately pastoral letter, strongly adjuring\nher to think of her health before all things, and assuring her that\nin his opinion, and in that of all his friends, she was quite right\nnot to come up to London. She wrote him a very short but a very\ngracious answer, thanking him for his solicitude, and explaining to\nhim that her condition made it quite impossible that she should leave\nPortray.\n\n\"I don't suppose anybody knows how ill I am; but it does not matter.\nWhen I am gone, they will know what they have done.\" Then Mr. Emilius\nresolved that he would go down to Scotland. Perhaps Lady Eustace was\nnot as ill as she thought; but it might be that the trial, and the\nhard things lately said of her, and her loneliness, and the feeling\nthat she needed protection, might, at such a moment as this, soften\nher heart. She should know at least that one tender friend did not\ndesert her because of the evil things which men said of her.\n\nHe went to Kilmarnock, thinking it better to make his approaches\nby degrees. Were he to present himself at once at the castle and\nbe refused admittance, he would hardly know how to repeat his\napplication or to force himself upon her presence. From Kilmarnock he\nwrote to her, saying that business connected with his ministrations\nduring the coming autumn had brought him into her beautiful\nneighbourhood, and that he could not leave it without paying his\nrespects to her in person. With her permission he would call upon\nher on the Thursday at about noon. He trusted that the state of her\nhealth would not prevent her from seeing him, and reminded her that\na clergyman was often as welcome a visitor at the bedside of the\ninvalid, as the doctor or the nurse. He gave her no address, as he\nrather wished to hinder her from answering him, but at the appointed\nhour he knocked at the castle-door.\n\nNeed it be said that Lizzie's state of health was not such as to\npreclude her from seeing so intimate a friend as Mr. Emilius? That\nshe was right to avoid by any effort the castigation which was to\nhave fallen upon her from the tongue of the learned serjeant, the\nreader who is not straight-laced will be disposed to admit. A lone\nwoman, very young, and delicately organised! How could she have stood\nup against such treatment as was in store for her? And is it not the\ncase that false pretexts against public demands are always held to be\njustifiable by the female mind? What lady will ever scruple to avoid\nher taxes? What woman ever understood her duty to the State? And this\nduty which was required of her was so terrible, that it might well\nhave reduced to falsehood a stouter heart than her own. It can hardly\nbe reckoned among Lizzie's great sins that she did not make that\njourney up to London. An appearance of sickness she did maintain,\neven with her own domestics. To do as much as that was due even to\nthe doctor whom she had cajoled out of the certificate, and who\nwas afterwards frightened into maintaining it. But Mr. Emilius was\nher clergyman,--her own clergyman, as she took care to say to her\nmaid,--her own clergyman, who had come all the way from London to be\npresent with her in her sickness; and of course she would see him.\n\nLizzie did not think much of the coming autumnal ministration at\nKilmarnock. She knew very well why Mr. Emilius had undertaken the\nexpense of a journey into Scotland in the middle of the London\nseason. She had been maimed fearfully in her late contests with the\nworld, and was now lame and soiled and impotent. The boy with none of\nthe equipments of the skilled sportsman can make himself master of\na wounded bird. Mr. Emilius was seeking her in the moment of her\nweakness, fearing that all chance of success might be over for him\nshould she ever again recover the full use of her wings. All this\nLizzie understood, and was able to measure Mr. Emilius at his own\nvalue of himself. But then, again, she was forced to ask herself what\nwas her value. She had been terribly mauled by the fowlers. She had\nbeen hit, so to say, on both wings, and hardly knew whether she would\never again be able to attempt a flight in public. She could not live\nalone in Portray Castle for the rest of her days. Ianthe's soul and\nthe Corsair were not, in truth, able to console her for the loss of\nsociety. She must have somebody to depend upon;--ah, some one whom,\nif it were possible, she might love. She saw no reason why she should\nnot love Mr. Emilius. She had been shockingly ill-treated by Lord\nFawn, and the Corsair, and Frank Greystock. No woman had ever been so\nknocked about in her affections. She pitied herself with an exceeding\npity when she thought of all the hardships which she had endured.\nLeft an early widow, persecuted by her husband's family, twice\nrobbed, spied upon by her own servants, unappreciated by the world at\nlarge, ill-used by three lovers, victimised by her selected friend,\nMrs. Carbuncle, and now driven out of society because she had lost\nher diamonds, was she not more cruelly treated than any woman of whom\nshe had ever read or heard? But she was not going to give up the\nbattle, even now. She still had her income, and she had great faith\nin income. And though she knew that she had been grievously wounded\nby the fowlers, she believed that time would heal her wounds. The\nworld would not continue to turn its back altogether upon a woman\nwith four thousand pounds a year, because she had told a fib about\nher necklace. She weighed all this; but the conviction strongest upon\nher mind was the necessity that she should have a husband. She felt\nthat a woman by herself in the world can do nothing, and that an\nunmarried woman's strength lies only in the expectation that she may\nsoon be married. To her it was essentially necessary that she should\nhave the protection of a husband who might endure on her behalf some\nportion of those buffetings to which she seemed to be especially\ndoomed. Could she do better with herself than take Mr. Emilius?\n\nMight she have chosen from all the world, Mr. Emilius was not,\nperhaps, the man whom she would have selected. There were, indeed,\nattributes in the man, very objectionable in the sight of some\npeople, which to her were not specially disagreeable. She thought him\nrather good-looking than otherwise, in spite of a slight defect in\nhis left eye. His coal-black, glossy hair commanded and obtained her\nadmiration, and she found his hooky nose to be handsome. She did not\nthink much of the ancestral blood of which he had boasted, and hardly\nbelieved that he would ever become a bishop. But he was popular, and\nwith a rich, titled wife, might become more so. Mr. Emilius and Lady\nEustace would, she thought, sound very well, and would surely make\ntheir way in society. The man had a grasping ambition about him,\nand a capacity, too, which, combined, would enable him to preach\nhimself into notoriety. And then in marrying Mr. Emilius, should she\ndetermine to do so, she might be sure, almost sure, of dictating her\nown terms as to settlement. With Lord Fawn, with Lord George, or even\nwith her cousin Frank, there would have been much difficulty. She\nthought that with Mr. Emilius she might obtain the undisputed command\nof her own income. But she did not quite make up her mind. She would\nsee him and hear what he had to say. Her income was her own, and\nshould she refuse Mr. Emilius, other suitors would no doubt come.\n\nShe dressed herself with considerable care,--having first thought of\nreceiving him in bed. But as the trial had now gone on without her,\nit would be convenient that her recovery should be commenced. So she\nhad herself dressed in a white morning wrapper with pink bows, and\nallowed the curl to be made fit to hang over her shoulder. And she\nput on a pair of pretty slippers, with gilt bindings, and took a\nlaced handkerchief and a volume of Shelley,--and so she prepared\nherself to receive Mr. Emilius. Lizzie, since the reader first knew\nher, had begun to use a little colouring in the arrangement of her\nface, and now, in honour of her sickness, she was very pale indeed.\nBut still, through the paleness, there was the faintest possible\ntinge of pink colour shining through the translucent pearl powder.\nAny one who knew Lizzie would be sure that, when she did paint, she\nwould paint well.\n\nThe conversation was at first, of course, confined to the lady's\nhealth. She thought that she was, perhaps, getting better, though, as\nthe doctor had told her, the reassuring symptoms might too probably\nonly be too fallacious. She could eat nothing,--literally nothing. A\nfew grapes out of the hothouse had supported her for the last week.\nThis statement was foolish on Lizzie's part, as Mr. Emilius was a man\nof an inquiring nature, and there was not a grape in the garden. Her\nonly delight was in reading and in her child's society. Sometimes she\nthought that she would pass away with the boy in her arms and her\nfavourite volume of Shelley in her hand. Mr. Emilius expressed a hope\nthat she would not pass away yet, for ever so many years. \"Oh, my\nfriend,\" said Lizzie, \"what is life, that one should desire it?\" Mr.\nEmilius of course reminded her that, though her life might be nothing\nto herself, it was very much indeed to those who loved her. \"Yes;--to\nmy boy,\" said Lizzie. Mr. Emilius informed her, with confidence, that\nit was not only her boy that loved her. There were others;--or, at\nany rate, one other. She might be sure of one faithful heart, if she\ncared for that. Lizzie only smiled, and threw from her taper fingers\na little paper pellet into the middle of the room,--probably with\nthe view of showing at what value she priced the heart of which Mr.\nEmilius was speaking.\n\nThe trial had occupied two days, Monday and Tuesday, and this was now\nthe Wednesday. The result had been telegraphed to Mr. Emilius,--of\ncourse without any record of the serjeant's bitter speech,--and the\nsuitor now gave the news to his lady-love. Those two horrid men had\nat last been found guilty, and punished with all the severity of the\nlaw. \"Poor fellows,\" said Lady Eustace,--\"poor Mr. Benjamin! Those\nill-starred jewels have been almost as unkind to him as to me.\"\n\n\"He'll never come back alive, of course,\" said Mr. Emilius. \"It'll\nkill him.\"\n\n\"And it will kill me too,\" said Lizzie. \"I have a something here\nwhich tells me that I shall never recover. Nobody will ever believe\nwhat I have suffered about those paltry diamonds. But he coveted\nthem. I never coveted them, Mr. Emilius; though I clung to them\nbecause they were my darling husband's last gift to me.\" Mr. Emilius\nassured her that he quite understood the facts, and appreciated all\nher feelings.\n\nAnd now, as he thought, had come the time for pressing his suit. With\nwidows, he had been told, the wooing should be brisk. He had already\nonce asked her to be his wife, and of course she knew the motive of\nhis journey to Scotland. \"Dearest Lady Eustace,\" he said suddenly,\n\"may I be allowed to renew the petition which I was once bold enough\nto make to you in London?\"\n\n\"Petition!\" exclaimed Lizzie.\n\n\"Ah yes; I can well understand that your indifference should enable\nyou to forget it. Lady Eustace, I did venture to tell you--that--I\nloved you.\"\n\n\"Mr. Emilius, so many men have told me that.\"\n\n\"I can well believe it. Some have told you so, perhaps, from base,\nmercenary motives.\"\n\n\"You are very complimentary, sir.\"\n\n\"I shall never pay you any compliments, Lady Eustace. Whatever may\nbe our future intercourse in life, you will only hear words of truth\nfrom my lips. Some have told you so from mercenary motives.\"--Mr.\nEmilius repeated the words with severity, and then paused to hear\nwhether she would dare to argue with him. As she was silent, he\nchanged his voice, and went on with that sweet, oily tone which had\nmade his fortune for him.--\"Some, no doubt, have spoken from the\ninner depths of their hearts. But none, Lady Eustace, have spoken\nwith such adamantine truth, with so intense an anxiety, with so\npersonal a solicitude for your welfare in this world and the next, as\nthat,--or I should rather say those,--which glow within this bosom.\"\nLizzie was certainly pleased by the manner in which he addressed her.\nShe thought that a man ought to dare to speak out, and that on such\nan occasion as this he should venture to do so with some enthusiasm\nand some poetry. She considered that men generally were afraid of\nexpressing themselves, and were as dumb as dogs from the want of\nbecoming spirit. Mr. Emilius gesticulated, and struck his breast, and\nbrought out his words as though he meant them.\n\n\"It is easy to say all that, Mr. Emilius,\" she replied.\n\n\"The saying of it is hard enough, Lady Eustace. You can never know\nhow hard it is to speak from a full heart. But to feel it, I will not\nsay is easy;--only to me, not to feel it is impossible. Lady Eustace,\nmy heart is devoted to your heart, and seeks its comrade. It is sick\nwith love and will not be stayed. It forces from me words,--words\nwhich will return upon me with all the bitterness of gall, if they be\nnot accepted by you as faithful, ay and of great value.\"\n\n\"I know well the value of such a heart as yours, Mr. Emilius.\"\n\n\"Accept it then, dearest one.\"\n\n\"Love will not always go by command, Mr. Emilius.\"\n\n\"No indeed;--nor at command will it stay away. Do you think I have\nnot tried that? Do you believe that for a man it can be pleasant to\nbe rebuffed;--that for one who up to this day has always walked on,\ntriumphant over every obstacle, who has conquered every nay that\nhas obstructed his path, it can have less of bitterness than the\nbitterness of death to encounter a no from the lips of a woman?\"\n\n\"A poor woman's no should be nothing to you, Mr. Emilius.\"\n\n\"It is everything to me,--death, destruction, annihilation,--unless\nI can overcome it. Darling of my heart, queen of my soul, empress\npresiding over the very spirit of my being, say,--shall I overcome it\nnow?\"\n\nShe had never been made love to after this fashion before. She\nknew, or half knew, that the man was a scheming hypocrite, craving\nher money, and following her in the hour of her troubles, because\nhe might then have the best chance of success. She had no belief\nwhatever in his love; and yet she liked it, and approved his\nproceedings. She liked lies, thinking them to be more beautiful than\ntruth. To lie readily and cleverly, recklessly and yet successfully,\nwas, according to the lessons which she had learned, a necessity in\nwoman and an added grace in man. There was that wretched Macnulty,\nwho would never lie; and what was the result? She was unfit even for\nthe poor condition of life which she pretended to fill. When poor\nMacnulty had heard that Mr. Emilius was coming to the castle, and had\nnot even mentioned her name, and again, when he had been announced on\nthis very morning, the unfortunate woman had been unable to control\nher absurd disappointment. \"Mr. Emilius,\" Lizzie said, throwing\nherself back upon her couch, \"you press me very hard.\"\n\n\"I would press you harder still to gain the glory I covet.\" And he\nmade a motion with his arms as though he had already got her tight\nwithin his grasp.\n\n\"You take advantage of my illness.\"\n\n\"In attacking a fortress do not the besiegers take all advantages?\nDear Lady Eustace, allow me to return to London with the right of\nprotecting your name at this moment, in which the false and the\nthoughtless are attacking it. You need a defender now.\"\n\n\"I can defend myself, sir, from all attacks. I do not know that any\none can hurt me.\"\n\n\"God forbid that you should be hurt. Heaven forbid that even the\nwinds of heaven should blow too harshly on my beloved. But my beloved\nis subject to the malice of the world. My beloved is a flower all\nbeautiful within and without, but one whose stalk is weak, whose\npetals are too delicate, whose soft bloom is evanescent. Let me be\nthe strong staff against which my beloved may blow in safety.\"\n\nA vague idea came across Lizzie's mind that this glowing language had\na taste of the Bible about it, and that, therefore, it was in some\ndegree impersonal, and intended to be pious. She did not relish piety\nat such a crisis as this, and was, therefore, for a moment inclined\nto be cold. But she liked being called a flower, and was not quite\nsure whether she remembered her Bible rightly. The words which struck\nher ear as familiar might have come from Juan and Haidee, and if so,\nnothing could be more opportune. \"Do you expect me to give you answer\nnow, Mr. Emilius?\"\n\n\"Yes,--now.\" And he stood before her in calm dignity, with his arms\ncrossed upon his breast.\n\nShe did give him his answer then and there, but first she turned her\nface to the wall,--or rather to the back of the sofa, and burst into\na flood of tears. It was a delicious moment to her, that in which she\nwas weeping. She sobbed forth something about her child, something\nabout her sorrows, something as to the wretchedness of her lot in\nlife, something of her widowed heart,--something also of that duty to\nothers which would compel her to keep her income in her own hands;\nand then she yielded herself to his entreaties.\n\n     *     *     *     *     *\n\nThat evening she thought it proper to tell Miss Macnulty what had\noccurred. \"He is a great preacher of the gospel,\" she said, \"and\nI know no position in the world more worthy of a woman's fondest\nadmiration.\" Miss Macnulty was unable to answer a word. She could not\ncongratulate her successful rival, even though her bread depended on\nit. She crept slowly out of the room, and went up-stairs, and wept.\n\nEarly in the month of June, Lady Eustace was led to the hymeneal\naltar by her clerical bridegroom. The wedding took place at the\nEpiscopal church at Ayr, far from the eyes of curious Londoners. It\nneed only be further said that Mr. Emilius could be persuaded to\nagree to no settlements prejudicial to that marital supremacy which\nshould be attached to the husband; and that Lizzie, when the moment\ncame, knowing that her betrothal had been made public to all the\nworld, did not dare to recede from another engagement. It may be\nthat Mr. Emilius will suit her as well as any husband that she could\nfind,--unless it shall be found that his previous career has been\ntoo adventurous. After a certain fashion he will, perhaps, be tender\nto her; but he will have his own way in everything, and be no whit\nafraid when she is about to die in an agony of tears before his eyes.\nThe writer of the present story may, however, declare that the future\nfate of this lady shall not be left altogether in obscurity.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXX\n\nWhat Was Said About It All at Matching\n\n\nThe Whitsuntide holidays were late this year, not taking place till\nthe beginning of June, and were protracted till the 9th of that\nmonth. On the 8th Lizzie and Mr. Emilius became man and wife, and\non that same day Lady Glencora Palliser entertained a large company\nof guests at Matching Priory. That the Duke of Omnium was there was\nquite a matter of course. Indeed, in these days Lady Glencora seldom\nseparated herself far, or for any long time, from her husband's\nuncle,--doing her duty to the head of her husband's family in the\nmost exemplary manner. People indeed said that she watched him\nnarrowly, but of persons in high station common people will say\nanything. It was at any rate certain that she made the declining\nyears of that great nobleman's life comfortable and decorous. Madame\nMax Goesler was also at Matching, a lady whose society always gave\ngratification to the duke. And Mr. Palliser was also there, taking\nthe rest that was so needful to him;--by which it must be understood\nthat after having worked all day, he was able to eat his dinner,\nand then only write a few letters before going to bed, instead of\nattending the House of Commons till two or three o'clock in the\nmorning. But his mind was still deep in quints and semitenths. His\ngreat measure was even now in committee. His hundred and second\nclause had been carried, with only nine divisions against him of any\nconsequence. Seven of the most material clauses had, no doubt, been\npostponed, and the great bone of contention as to the two superfluous\nfarthings still remained before him. Nevertheless he fondly hoped\nthat he would be able to send his bill complete to the House of Lords\nbefore the end of July. What might be done in the way of amendments\nthere he had hitherto refused to consider. \"If the peers choose\nto put themselves in opposition to the whole nation on a purely\ncommercial question, the responsibility of all evils that may follow\nmust be at their doors.\" This he had said as a commoner. A year or\ntwo at the farthest,--or more probably a few months,--would make him\na peer; and then, no doubt, he would look at the matter in a wholly\ndifferent light. But he worked at his great measure with a diligence\nwhich at any rate deserved success; and he now had with him a\nwhole bevy of secretaries, private secretaries, chief clerks, and\naccountants, all of whom Lady Glencora captivated by her flattering\nways, and laughed at behind their backs. Mr. Bonteen was there with\nhis wife, repeatedly declaring to all his friends that England would\nachieve the glories of decimal coinage by his blood and over his\ngrave,--and Barrington Erle, who took things much more easily, and\nLord Chiltern, with his wife, who would occasionally ask her if she\ncould explain to him the value of a quint, and many others whom it\nmay not be necessary to name. Lord Fawn was not there. Lord Fawn,\nwhose health had temporarily given way beneath the pressing labours\nof the India Board, was visiting his estates in Tipperary.\n\n\"She is married to-day, duke, down in Scotland,\"--said Lady Glencora,\nsitting close to the duke's ear, for the duke was a little deaf. They\nwere in the duke's small morning sitting-room, and no one else was\npresent excepting Madame Max Goesler.\n\n\"Married to-morrow,--down in Scotland. Dear, dear! what is he?\" The\nprofession to which Mr. Emilius belonged had been mentioned to the\nduke more than once before.\n\n\"He's some sort of a clergyman, duke. You went and heard him preach,\nMadame Max. You can tell us what he's like.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; he's a clergyman of our church,\" said Madame Goesler.\n\n\"A clergyman of our church;--dear, dear. And married in Scotland!\nThat makes it stranger. I wonder what made a clergyman marry her?\"\n\n\"Money, duke,\" said Lady Glencora, speaking very loud.\n\n\"Oh, ah, yes; money. So he'd got money; had he?\"\n\n\"Not a penny, duke; but she had.\"\n\n\"Oh, ah, yes. I forgot. She was very well left; wasn't she? And so\nshe has married a clergyman without a penny. Dear, dear! Did not you\nsay she was very beautiful?\"\n\n\"Lovely!\"\n\n\"Let me see,--you went and saw her, didn't you?\"\n\n\"I went to her twice,--and got quite scolded about it. Plantagenet\nsaid that if I wanted horrors I'd better go to Madame Tussaud. Didn't\nhe, Madame Max?\" Madame Max smiled and nodded her head.\n\n\"And what's the clergyman like?\" asked the duke.\n\n\"Now, my dear, you must take up the running,\" said Lady Glencora,\ndropping her voice. \"I ran after the lady, but it was you who ran\nafter the gentleman.\" Then she raised her voice. \"Madame Max will\ntell you all about it, duke. She knows him very well.\"\n\n\"You know him very well; do you? Dear, dear, dear!\"\n\n\"I don't know him at all, duke, but I once went to hear him preach.\nHe's one of those men who string words together, and do a good deal\nof work with a cambric pocket-handkerchief.\"\n\n\"A gentleman?\" asked the duke.\n\n\"About as like a gentleman as you're like an archbishop,\" said Lady\nGlencora.\n\nThis tickled the duke amazingly. \"He, he, he;--I don't see why I\nshouldn't be like an archbishop. If I hadn't happened to be a duke,\nI should have liked to be an archbishop. Both the archbishops take\nrank of me. I never quite understood why that was, but they do. And\nthese things never can be altered when they're once settled. It's\nquite absurd, now-a-days, since they've cut the archbishops down so\nterribly. They were princes once, I suppose, and had great power. But\nit's quite absurd now, and so they must feel it. I have often thought\nabout that a good deal, Glencora.\"\n\n\"And I think about poor Mrs. Arch, who hasn't got any rank at all.\"\n\n\"A great prelate having a wife does seem to be an absurdity,\" said\nMadame Max, who had passed some years of her life in a Catholic\ncountry.\n\n\"And the man is a cad;--is he?\" asked the duke.\n\n\"A Bohemian Jew, duke,--an impostor who has come over here to make a\nfortune. We hear that he has a wife in Prague, and probably two or\nthree elsewhere. But he has got poor little Lizzie Eustace and all\nher money into his grasp, and they who know him say that he's likely\nto keep it.\"\n\n\"Dear, dear, dear!\"\n\n\"Barrington says that the best spec he knows out, for a younger son,\nwould be to go to Prague for the former wife, and bring her back with\nevidence of the marriage. The poor little woman could not fail of\nbeing grateful to the hero who would liberate her.\"\n\n\"Dear, dear, dear!\" said the duke. \"And the diamonds never turned up\nafter all. I think that was a pity, because I knew the late man's\nfather very well. We used to be together a good deal at one time. He\nhad a fine property, and we used to live--but I can't just tell you\nhow we used to live. He, he, he!\"\n\n\"You had better tell us nothing about it, duke,\" said Madame Max.\n\nThe affairs of our heroine were again discussed that evening in\nanother part of the Priory. They were in the billiard-room in the\nevening, and Mr. Bonteen was inveighing against the inadequacy of the\nlaw as it had been brought to bear against the sinners who, between\nthem, had succeeded in making away with the Eustace diamonds. \"It\nwas a most unworthy conclusion to such a plot,\" he said. \"It always\nhappens that they catch the small fry, and let the large fish\nescape.\"\n\n\"Whom did you specially want to catch?\" asked Lady Glencora.\n\n\"Lady Eustace, and Lord George de Bruce Carruthers,--as he calls\nhimself.\"\n\n\"I quite agree with you, Mr. Bonteen, that it would be very nice to\nsend the brother of a marquis to Botany Bay, or wherever they go now;\nand that it would do a deal of good to have the widow of a baronet\nlocked up in the Penitentiary; but you see, if they didn't happen to\nbe guilty, it would be almost a shame to punish them for the sake of\nthe example.\"\n\n\"They ought to have been guilty,\" said Barrington Erle.\n\n\"They were guilty,\" protested Mr. Bonteen.\n\nMr. Palliser was enjoying ten minutes of recreation before he went\nback to his letters. \"I can't say that I attended to the case very\nclosely,\" he observed, \"and perhaps, therefore, I am not entitled to\nspeak about it.\"\n\n\"If people only spoke about what they attended to, how very little\nthere would be to say,--eh, Mr. Bonteen?\" This observation came, of\ncourse, from Lady Glencora.\n\n\"But as far as I could hear,\" continued Mr. Palliser, \"Lord George\nCarruthers cannot possibly have had anything to do with it. It was a\nstupid mistake on the part of the police.\"\n\n\"I'm not quite so sure, Mr. Palliser,\" said Bonteen.\n\n\"I know Coldfoot told me so.\" Now Sir Harry Coldfoot was at this time\nSecretary of State for the Home affairs, and in a matter of such\nimportance of course had an opinion of his own.\n\n\"We all know that he had money dealings with Benjamin, the Jew,\" said\nMrs. Bonteen.\n\n\"Why didn't he come forward as a witness when he was summoned?\" asked\nMr. Bonteen triumphantly. \"And as for the woman, does anybody mean to\nsay that she should not have been indicted for perjury?\"\n\n\"The woman, as you are pleased to call her, is my particular friend,\"\nsaid Lady Glencora. When Lady Glencora made any such statement as\nthis,--and she often did make such statements,--no one dared to\nanswer her. It was understood that Lady Glencora was not to be\nsnubbed, though she was very much given to snubbing others. She had\nattained this position for herself by a mixture of beauty, rank,\nwealth, and courage;--but the courage had, of the four, been her\ngreatest mainstay.\n\nThen Lord Chiltern, who was playing billiards with Barrington Erle,\nrapped his cue down on the floor, and made a speech. \"I never was\nso sick of anything in my life as I am of Lady Eustace. People have\ntalked about her now for the last six months.\"\n\n\"Only three months, Lord Chiltern,\" said Lady Glencora, in a tone of\nrebuke.\n\n\"And all that I can hear of her is, that she has told a lot of lies\nand lost a necklace.\"\n\n\"When Lady Chiltern loses a necklace worth ten thousand pounds there\nwill be talk of her,\" said Lady Glencora.\n\nAt that moment Madame Max Goesler entered the room and whispered a\nword to the hostess. She had just come from the duke, who could not\nbear the racket of the billiard-room. \"Wants to go to bed, does he?\nVery well. I'll go to him.\"\n\n\"He seems to be quite fatigued with his fascination about Lady\nEustace.\"\n\n\"I call that woman a perfect God-send. What should we have done\nwithout her?\" This Lady Glencora said almost to herself as she\nprepared to join the duke. The duke had only one more observation to\nmake before he retired for the night. \"I'm afraid, you know, that\nyour friend hasn't what I call a good time before her, Glencora.\"\n\nIn this opinion of the Duke of Omnium, the readers of this story will\nperhaps agree.\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE EUSTACE DIAMONDS***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 7381-8.txt or 7381-8.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/dirs\/7\/3\/8\/7381\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/pglaf.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/about\/contact\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":995,"split":"train"}
