Doctor Thorne begins to establish a medical practice, while Henry seduces Mary Scatcherd, the sister of stonemason Roger Scatcherd. When Scatcherd finds out that Mary has become pregnant, he seeks out Henry and kills him in a fight.\nWhile her brother is in prison, Mary gives birth to a girl. A former suitor offers to marry her and emigrate to the United States to start a new life but refuses to take the baby. Doctor Thorne persuades her to accept the generous offer, promising to raise his niece. He names her Mary Thorne but wishing neither to have her illegitimacy made public nor to have her associate with the uncouth Roger Scatcherd, he keeps her birth secret. He tells Scatcherd that the baby had died.\nAfter his release, Scatcherd rises quickly in the world as a railway project undertaker. In time, his skills make him extremely rich. When he completes a seemingly-impossible important project on time, he is made a baronet for his efforts. Throughout his career, he entrusts his financial affairs to Doctor Thorne. When Thorne becomes the family doctor to the Greshams, he persuades Scatcherd to lend ever growing sums to the head of the family, the local squire, who has troubles managing his finance. Eventually, much of the Gresham estate is put up as collateral.\nMeanwhile, Mary grows up with the Gresham children and becomes a great favourite with the whole family. As a result, Thorne feels obliged to tell his friend the squire the secret concerning her birth.\nMary falls in love with Frank Gresham, the only son and heir of the squire of Greshamsbury and nephew of the Earl and Countess de Courcy, and he with her. His parents desperately need him to marry wealth, to rescue them from the financial distress resulting from the squire's expensive and fruitless campaigns for a seat in Parliament. As Mary is penniless and of low birth, such a marriage is frowned upon by his mother Lady Arabella and the de Courcys.\nHis snobbish mother and maternal aunt bearing the aristocratic de Courcy family name wish him to marry a thirty-year-old eccentric but intelligent and kind-hearted, heiress, Martha Dunstable. He reluctantly visits Courcy Castle and they become friends. He foolishly and playfully proposes. She demurs, knowing that he does not love her and he tells her about his love for Mary.\nSir Roger is a chronic drunkard and Doctor Thorne tries in vain to get him to curtail his drinking. In his will, he stipulates that the bulk of his estate go to his odious, dissolute only son Louis Philippe but he leaves Doctor Thorne in control of the inheritance until the heir reaches the age of twenty-five. Should Louis die before then, Scatcherd stipulates that the estate go to his sister Mary's eldest child. Thorne is forced to divulge Mary's history but Scatcherd leaves the will unchanged.\nSir Roger eventually dies of drink and Sir Louis inherits his vast wealth. The son proves just as much an alcoholic as the father and his weaker constitution quickly brings him to the same end, before he reaches twenty-five. After consulting with many lawyers, Doctor Thorne confirms that his niece Mary is the heiress, richer than even Miss Dunstable.\nUnaware of these proceedings, the still resolute Frank finally persuades his doting father to consent to his marriage to Mary. When all is revealed, everyone is elated, even Frank's mother and Countess de Courcy and their wedding becomes a much talked of event after the marriage of Mr Oriel and Beatrice Gresham, Frank's younger sister and Mary's best friend.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, Doctor Thorne, by Anthony Trollope\n\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Its green pastures, its waving wheat, its deep\nand shady and--let us add--dirty lanes, its paths and stiles, its\ntawny-coloured, well-built rural churches, its avenues of beeches,\nand frequent Tudor mansions, its constant county hunt, its social\ngraces, and the general air of clanship which pervades it, has made\nit to its own inhabitants a favoured land of Goshen. It is purely\nagricultural; agricultural in its produce, agricultural in its poor,\nand agricultural in its pleasures. There are towns in it, of course;\nd\u00c3\u00a9p\u00c3\u00b4ts from whence are brought seeds and groceries, ribbons and\nfire-shovels; in which markets are held and county balls are carried\non; which return members to Parliament, generally--in spite of Reform\nBills, past, present, and coming--in accordance with the dictates\nof some neighbouring land magnate: from whence emanate the country\npostmen, and where is located the supply of post-horses necessary\nfor county visitings. But these towns add nothing to the importance\nof the county; they consist, with the exception of the assize town,\nof dull, all but death-like single streets. Each possesses two\npumps, three hotels, ten shops, fifteen beer-houses, a beadle, and a\nmarket-place.\n\nIndeed, the town population of the county reckons for nothing when\nthe importance of the county is discussed, with the exception, as\nbefore said, of the assize town, which is also a cathedral city.\nHerein is a clerical aristocracy, which is certainly not without its\ndue weight. A resident bishop, a resident dean, an archdeacon, three\nor four resident prebendaries, and all their numerous chaplains,\nvicars, and ecclesiastical satellites, do make up a society\nsufficiently powerful to be counted as something by the county\nsquirearchy. In other respects the greatness of Barsetshire depends\nwholly on the landed powers.\n\nBarsetshire, however, is not now so essentially one whole as it was\nbefore the Reform Bill divided it. There is in these days an East\nBarsetshire, and there is a West Barsetshire; and people conversant\nwith Barsetshire doings declare that they can already decipher some\ndifference of feeling, some division of interests. The eastern moiety\nof the county is more purely Conservative than the western; there\nis, or was, a taint of Peelism in the latter; and then, too, the\nresidence of two such great Whig magnates as the Duke of Omnium and\nthe Earl de Courcy in that locality in some degree overshadows and\nrenders less influential the gentlemen who live near them.\n\nIt is to East Barsetshire that we are called. When the division above\nspoken of was first contemplated, in those stormy days in which\ngallant men were still combatting reform ministers, if not with hope,\nstill with spirit, the battle was fought by none more bravely than\nby John Newbold Gresham of Greshamsbury, the member for Barsetshire.\nFate, however, and the Duke of Wellington were adverse, and in the\nfollowing Parliament John Newbold Gresham was only member for East\nBarsetshire.\n\nWhether or not it was true, as stated at the time, that the aspect of\nthe men with whom he was called on to associate at St Stephen's broke\nhis heart, it is not for us now to inquire. It is certainly true that\nhe did not live to see the first year of the reformed Parliament\nbrought to a close. The then Mr Gresham was not an old man at the\ntime of his death, and his eldest son, Francis Newbold Gresham, was a\nvery young man; but, notwithstanding his youth, and notwithstanding\nother grounds of objection which stood in the way of such preferment,\nand which must be explained, he was chosen in his father's place.\nThe father's services had been too recent, too well appreciated, too\nthoroughly in unison with the feelings of those around him to allow\nof any other choice; and in this way young Frank Gresham found\nhimself member for East Barsetshire, although the very men who\nelected him knew that they had but slender ground for trusting him\nwith their suffrages.\n\nFrank Gresham, though then only twenty-four years of age, was a\nmarried man, and a father. He had already chosen a wife, and by\nhis choice had given much ground of distrust to the men of East\nBarsetshire. He had married no other than Lady Arabella de Courcy,\nthe sister of the great Whig earl who lived at Courcy Castle in the\nwest; that earl who not only voted for the Reform Bill, but had been\ninfamously active in bringing over other young peers so to vote,\nand whose name therefore stank in the nostrils of the staunch Tory\nsquires of the county.\n\nNot only had Frank Gresham so wedded, but having thus improperly and\nunpatriotically chosen a wife, he had added to his sins by becoming\nrecklessly intimate with his wife's relations. It is true that he\nstill called himself a Tory, belonged to the club of which his father\nhad been one of the most honoured members, and in the days of the\ngreat battle got his head broken in a row, on the right side; but,\nnevertheless, it was felt by the good men, true and blue, of East\nBarsetshire, that a constant sojourner at Courcy Castle could not be\nregarded as a consistent Tory. When, however, his father died, that\nbroken head served him in good stead: his sufferings in the cause\nwere made the most of; these, in unison with his father's merits,\nturned the scale, and it was accordingly decided, at a meeting held\nat the George and Dragon, at Barchester, that Frank Gresham should\nfill his father's shoes.\n\nBut Frank Gresham could not fill his father's shoes; they were too\nbig for him. He did become member for East Barsetshire, but he was\nsuch a member--so lukewarm, so indifferent, so prone to associate\nwith the enemies of the good cause, so little willing to fight the\ngood fight, that he soon disgusted those who most dearly loved the\nmemory of the old squire.\n\nDe Courcy Castle in those days had great allurements for a young man,\nand all those allurements were made the most of to win over young\nGresham. His wife, who was a year or two older than himself, was a\nfashionable woman, with thorough Whig tastes and aspirations, such\nas became the daughter of a great Whig earl; she cared for politics,\nor thought that she cared for them, more than her husband did; for\na month or two previous to her engagement she had been attached to\nthe Court, and had been made to believe that much of the policy of\nEngland's rulers depended on the political intrigues of England's\nwomen. She was one who would fain be doing something if she only\nknew how, and the first important attempt she made was to turn her\nrespectable young Tory husband into a second-rate Whig bantling. As\nthis lady's character will, it is hoped, show itself in the following\npages, we need not now describe it more closely.\n\nIt is not a bad thing to be son-in-law to a potent earl, member of\nParliament for a county, and a possessor of a fine old English seat,\nand a fine old English fortune. As a very young man, Frank Gresham\nfound the life to which he was thus introduced agreeable enough. He\nconsoled himself as best he might for the blue looks with which he\nwas greeted by his own party, and took his revenge by consorting more\nthoroughly than ever with his political adversaries. Foolishly, like\na foolish moth, he flew to the bright light, and, like the moths,\nof course he burnt his wings. Early in 1833 he had become a member\nof Parliament, and in the autumn of 1834 the dissolution came.\nYoung members of three or four-and-twenty do not think much of\ndissolutions, forget the fancies of their constituents, and are too\nproud of the present to calculate much as to the future. So it was\nwith Mr Gresham. His father had been member for Barsetshire all his\nlife, and he looked forward to similar prosperity as though it were\npart of his inheritance; but he failed to take any of the steps which\nhad secured his father's seat.\n\nIn the autumn of 1834 the dissolution came, and Frank Gresham, with\nhis honourable lady wife and all the de Courcys at his back, found\nthat he had mortally offended the county. To his great disgust\nanother candidate was brought forward as a fellow to his late\ncolleague, and though he manfully fought the battle, and spent ten\nthousand pounds in the contest, he could not recover his position. A\nhigh Tory, with a great Whig interest to back him, is never a popular\nperson in England. No one can trust him, though there may be those\nwho are willing to place him, untrusted, in high positions. Such\nwas the case with Mr Gresham. There were many who were willing, for\nfamily considerations, to keep him in Parliament; but no one thought\nthat he was fit to be there. The consequences were, that a bitter\nand expensive contest ensued. Frank Gresham, when twitted with being\na Whig, foreswore the de Courcy family; and then, when ridiculed as\nhaving been thrown over by the Tories, foreswore his father's old\nfriends. So between the two stools he fell to the ground, and, as a\npolitician, he never again rose to his feet.\n\nHe never again rose to his feet; but twice again he made violent\nefforts to do so. Elections in East Barsetshire, from various\ncauses, came quick upon each other in those days, and before he was\neight-and-twenty years of age Mr Gresham had three times contested\nthe county and been three times beaten. To speak the truth of him,\nhis own spirit would have been satisfied with the loss of the first\nten thousand pounds; but Lady Arabella was made of higher mettle. She\nhad married a man with a fine place and a fine fortune; but she had\nnevertheless married a commoner and had in so far derogated from her\nhigh birth. She felt that her husband should be by rights a member of\nthe House of Lords; but, if not, that it was at least essential that\nhe should have a seat in the lower chamber. She would by degrees sink\ninto nothing if she allowed herself to sit down, the mere wife of a\nmere country squire.\n\nThus instigated, Mr Gresham repeated the useless contest three times,\nand repeated it each time at a serious cost. He lost his money, Lady\nArabella lost her temper, and things at Greshamsbury went on by no\nmeans as prosperously as they had done in the days of the old squire.\n\nIn the first twelve years of their marriage, children came fast into\nthe nursery at Greshamsbury. The first that was born was a boy; and\nin those happy halcyon days, when the old squire was still alive,\ngreat was the joy at the birth of an heir to Greshamsbury; bonfires\ngleamed through the country-side, oxen were roasted whole, and\nthe customary paraphernalia of joy, usual to rich Britons on such\noccasions were gone through with wondrous \u00c3\u00a9clat. But when the tenth\nbaby, and the ninth little girl, was brought into the world, the\noutward show of joy was not so great.\n\nThen other troubles came on. Some of these little girls were sickly,\nsome very sickly. Lady Arabella had her faults, and they were such as\nwere extremely detrimental to her husband's happiness and her own;\nbut that of being an indifferent mother was not among them. She had\nworried her husband daily for years because he was not in Parliament,\nshe had worried him because he would not furnish the house in Portman\nSquare, she had worried him because he objected to have more people\nevery winter at Greshamsbury Park than the house would hold; but now\nshe changed her tune and worried him because Selina coughed, because\nHelena was hectic, because poor Sophy's spine was weak, and Matilda's\nappetite was gone.\n\nWorrying from such causes was pardonable it will be said. So it was;\nbut the manner was hardly pardonable. Selina's cough was certainly\nnot fairly attributable to the old-fashioned furniture in Portman\nSquare; nor would Sophy's spine have been materially benefited by\nher father having a seat in Parliament; and yet, to have heard Lady\nArabella discussing those matters in family conclave, one would have\nthought that she would have expected such results.\n\nAs it was, her poor weak darlings were carried about from London to\nBrighton, from Brighton to some German baths, from the German baths\nback to Torquay, and thence--as regarded the four we have named--to\nthat bourne from whence no further journey could be made under the\nLady Arabella's directions.\n\nThe one son and heir to Greshamsbury was named as his father, Francis\nNewbold Gresham. He would have been the hero of our tale had not that\nplace been pre-occupied by the village doctor. As it is, those who\nplease may so regard him. It is he who is to be our favourite young\nman, to do the love scenes, to have his trials and his difficulties,\nand to win through them or not, as the case may be. I am too old now\nto be a hard-hearted author, and so it is probable that he may not\ndie of a broken heart. Those who don't approve of a middle-aged\nbachelor country doctor as a hero, may take the heir to Greshamsbury\nin his stead, and call the book, if it so please them, \"The Loves and\nAdventures of Francis Newbold Gresham the Younger.\"\n\nAnd Master Frank Gresham was not ill adapted for playing the part\nof a hero of this sort. He did not share his sisters' ill-health,\nand though the only boy of the family, he excelled all his sisters\nin personal appearance. The Greshams from time immemorial had been\nhandsome. They were broad browed, blue eyed, fair haired, born with\ndimples in their chins, and that pleasant, aristocratic dangerous\ncurl of the upper lip which can equally express good humour or scorn.\nYoung Frank was every inch a Gresham, and was the darling of his\nfather's heart.\n\nThe de Courcys had never been plain. There was too much hauteur, too\nmuch pride, we may perhaps even fairly say, too much nobility in\ntheir gait and manners, and even in their faces, to allow of their\nbeing considered plain; but they were not a race nurtured by Venus\nor Apollo. They were tall and thin, with high cheek-bones, high\nforeheads, and large, dignified, cold eyes. The de Courcy girls had\nall good hair; and, as they also possessed easy manners and powers\nof talking, they managed to pass in the world for beauties till they\nwere absorbed in the matrimonial market, and the world at large cared\nno longer whether they were beauties or not. The Misses Gresham were\nmade in the de Courcy mould, and were not on this account the less\ndear to their mother.\n\nThe two eldest, Augusta and Beatrice, lived, and were apparently\nlikely to live. The four next faded and died one after another--all\nin the same sad year--and were laid in the neat, new cemetery at\nTorquay. Then came a pair, born at one birth, weak, delicate, frail\nlittle flowers, with dark hair and dark eyes, and thin, long, pale\nfaces, with long, bony hands, and long bony feet, whom men looked on\nas fated to follow their sisters with quick steps. Hitherto, however,\nthey had not followed them, nor had they suffered as their sisters\nhad suffered; and some people at Greshamsbury attributed this to the\nfact that a change had been made in the family medical practitioner.\n\nThen came the youngest of the flock, she whose birth we have said was\nnot heralded with loud joy; for when she came into the world, four\nothers, with pale temples, wan, worn cheeks, and skeleton, white\narms, were awaiting permission to leave it.\n\nSuch was the family when, in the year 1854, the eldest son came of\nage. He had been educated at Harrow, and was now still at Cambridge;\nbut, of course, on such a day as this he was at home. That coming of\nage must be a delightful time to a young man born to inherit broad\nacres and wide wealth. Those full-mouthed congratulations; those\nwarm prayers with which his manhood is welcomed by the grey-haired\nseniors of the county; the affectionate, all but motherly caresses of\nneighbouring mothers who have seen him grow up from his cradle, of\nmothers who have daughters, perhaps, fair enough, and good enough,\nand sweet enough even for him; the soft-spoken, half-bashful, but\ntender greetings of the girls, who now, perhaps for the first time,\ncall him by his stern family name, instructed by instinct rather than\nprecept that the time has come when the familiar Charles or familiar\nJohn must by them be laid aside; the \"lucky dogs,\" and hints of\nsilver spoons which are poured into his ears as each young compeer\nslaps his back and bids him live a thousand years and then never die;\nthe shouting of the tenantry, the good wishes of the old farmers who\ncome up to wring his hand, the kisses which he gets from the farmers'\nwives, and the kisses which he gives to the farmers' daughters; all\nthese things must make the twenty-first birthday pleasant enough to\na young heir. To a youth, however, who feels that he is now liable\nto arrest, and that he inherits no other privilege, the pleasure may\nvery possibly not be quite so keen.\n\nThe case with young Frank Gresham may be supposed to much nearer the\nformer than the latter; but yet the ceremony of his coming of age\nwas by no means like that which fate had accorded to his father. Mr\nGresham was now an embarrassed man, and though the world did not know\nit, or, at any rate, did not know that he was deeply embarrassed, he\nhad not the heart to throw open his mansion and receive the county\nwith a free hand as though all things were going well with him.\n\nNothing was going well with him. Lady Arabella would allow nothing\nnear him or around him to be well. Everything with him now turned to\nvexation; he was no longer a joyous, happy man, and the people of\nEast Barsetshire did not look for gala doings on a grand scale when\nyoung Gresham came of age.\n\nGala doings, to a certain extent, there were there. It was in July,\nand tables were spread under the oaks for the tenants. Tables were\nspread, and meat, and beer, and wine were there, and Frank, as he\nwalked round and shook his guests by the hand, expressed a hope that\ntheir relations with each other might be long, close, and mutually\nadvantageous.\n\nWe must say a few words now about the place itself. Greshamsbury\nPark was a fine old English gentleman's seat--was and is; but we can\nassert it more easily in past tense, as we are speaking of it with\nreference to a past time. We have spoken of Greshamsbury Park; there\nwas a park so called, but the mansion itself was generally known as\nGreshamsbury House, and did not stand in the park. We may perhaps\nbest describe it by saying that the village of Greshamsbury consisted\nof one long, straggling street, a mile in length, which in the centre\nturned sharp round, so that one half of the street lay directly at\nright angles to the other. In this angle stood Greshamsbury House,\nand the gardens and grounds around it filled up the space so made.\nThere was an entrance with large gates at each end of the village,\nand each gate was guarded by the effigies of two huge pagans with\nclubs, such being the crest borne by the family; from each entrance a\nbroad road, quite straight, running through to a majestic avenue of\nlimes, led up to the house. This was built in the richest, perhaps we\nshould rather say in the purest, style of Tudor architecture; so much\nso that, though Greshamsbury is less complete than Longleat, less\nmagnificent than Hatfield, it may in some sense be said to be the\nfinest specimen of Tudor architecture of which the country can boast.\n\nIt stands amid a multitude of trim gardens and stone-built terraces,\ndivided one from another: these to our eyes are not so attractive as\nthat broad expanse of lawn by which our country houses are generally\nsurrounded; but the gardens of Greshamsbury have been celebrated for\ntwo centuries, and any Gresham who would have altered them would have\nbeen considered to have destroyed one of the well-known landmarks of\nthe family.\n\nGreshamsbury Park--properly so called--spread far away on the other\nside of the village. Opposite to the two great gates leading up\nto the mansion were two smaller gates, the one opening on to the\nstables, kennels, and farm-yard, and the other to the deer park. This\nlatter was the principal entrance to the demesne, and a grand and\npicturesque entrance it was. The avenue of limes which on one side\nstretched up to the house, was on the other extended for a quarter of\na mile, and then appeared to be terminated only by an abrupt rise in\nthe ground. At the entrance there were four savages and four clubs,\ntwo to each portal, and what with the massive iron gates, surmounted\nby a stone wall, on which stood the family arms supported by two\nother club-bearers, the stone-built lodges, the Doric, ivy-covered\ncolumns which surrounded the circle, the four grim savages, and the\nextent of the space itself through which the high road ran, and which\njust abutted on the village, the spot was sufficiently significant of\nold family greatness.\n\nThose who examined it more closely might see that under the arms was\na scroll bearing the Gresham motto, and that the words were repeated\nin smaller letters under each of the savages. \"Gardez Gresham,\"\nhad been chosen in the days of motto-choosing probably by some\nherald-at-arms as an appropriate legend for signifying the peculiar\nattributes of the family. Now, however, unfortunately, men were not\nof one mind as to the exact idea signified. Some declared, with much\nheraldic warmth, that it was an address to the savages, calling on\nthem to take care of their patron; while others, with whom I myself\nam inclined to agree, averred with equal certainty that it was an\nadvice to the people at large, especially to those inclined to rebel\nagainst the aristocracy of the county, that they should \"beware the\nGresham.\" The latter signification would betoken strength--so said\nthe holders of this doctrine; the former weakness. Now the Greshams\nwere ever a strong people, and never addicted to a false humility.\n\nWe will not pretend to decide the question. Alas! either construction\nwas now equally unsuited to the family fortunes. Such changes had\ntaken place in England since the Greshams had founded themselves that\nno savage could any longer in any way protect them; they must protect\nthemselves like common folk, or live unprotected. Nor now was it\nnecessary that any neighbour should shake in his shoes when the\nGresham frowned. It would have been to be wished that the present\nGresham himself could have been as indifferent to the frowns of some\nof his neighbours.\n\nBut the old symbols remained, and may such symbols long remain among\nus; they are still lovely and fit to be loved. They tell us of the\ntrue and manly feelings of other times; and to him who can read\naright, they explain more fully, more truly than any written history\ncan do, how Englishmen have become what they are. England is not yet\na commercial country in the sense in which that epithet is used for\nher; and let us still hope that she will not soon become so. She\nmight surely as well be called feudal England, or chivalrous England.\nIf in western civilised Europe there does exist a nation among whom\nthere are high signors, and with whom the owners of the land are\nthe true aristocracy, the aristocracy that is trusted as being best\nand fittest to rule, that nation is the English. Choose out the ten\nleading men of each great European people. Choose them in France, in\nAustria, Sardinia, Prussia, Russia, Sweden, Denmark, Spain (?), and\nthen select the ten in England whose names are best known as those of\nleading statesmen; the result will show in which country there still\nexists the closest attachment to, the sincerest trust in, the old\nfeudal and now so-called landed interests.\n\nEngland a commercial country! Yes; as Venice was. She may excel\nother nations in commerce, but yet it is not that in which she most\nprides herself, in which she most excels. Merchants as such are not\nthe first men among us; though it perhaps be open, barely open, to\na merchant to become one of them. Buying and selling is good and\nnecessary; it is very necessary, and may, possibly, be very good; but\nit cannot be the noblest work of man; and let us hope that it may not\nin our time be esteemed the noblest work of an Englishman.\n\nGreshamsbury Park was very large; it lay on the outside of the angle\nformed by the village street, and stretched away on two sides without\napparent limit or boundaries visible from the village road or house.\nIndeed, the ground on this side was so broken up into abrupt hills,\nand conical-shaped, oak-covered excrescences, which were seen peeping\nup through and over each other, that the true extent of the park was\nmuch magnified to the eye. It was very possible for a stranger to get\ninto it and to find some difficulty in getting out again by any of\nits known gates; and such was the beauty of the landscape, that a\nlover of scenery would be tempted thus to lose himself.\n\nI have said that on one side lay the kennels, and this will give\nme an opportunity of describing here one especial episode, a long\nepisode, in the life of the existing squire. He had once represented\nhis county in Parliament, and when he ceased to do so he still felt\nan ambition to be connected in some peculiar way with that county's\ngreatness; he still desired that Gresham of Greshamsbury should be\nsomething more in East Barsetshire than Jackson of the Grange, or\nBaker of Mill Hill, or Bateson of Annesgrove. They were all his\nfriends, and very respectable country gentlemen; but Mr Gresham of\nGreshamsbury should be more than this: even he had enough of ambition\nto be aware of such a longing. Therefore, when an opportunity\noccurred he took to hunting the county.\n\nFor this employment he was in every way well suited--unless it was in\nthe matter of finance. Though he had in his very earliest manly years\ngiven such great offence by indifference to his family politics,\nand had in a certain degree fostered the ill-feeling by contesting\nthe county in opposition to the wishes of his brother squires,\nnevertheless, he bore a loved and popular name. Men regretted that he\nshould not have been what they wished him to be, that he should not\nhave been such as was the old squire; but when they found that such\nwas the case, that he could not be great among them as a politician,\nthey were still willing that he should be great in any other way if\nthere were county greatness for which he was suited. Now he was known\nas an excellent horseman, as a thorough sportsman, as one knowing in\ndogs, and tender-hearted as a sucking mother to a litter of young\nfoxes; he had ridden in the county since he was fifteen, had a fine\nvoice for a view-hallo, knew every hound by name, and could wind a\nhorn with sufficient music for all hunting purposes; moreover, he had\ncome to his property, as was well known through all Barsetshire, with\na clear income of fourteen thousand a year.\n\nThus, when some old worn-out master of hounds was run to ground,\nabout a year after Mr Gresham's last contest for the county, it\nseemed to all parties to be a pleasant and rational arrangement that\nthe hounds should go to Greshamsbury. Pleasant, indeed, to all except\nthe Lady Arabella; and rational, perhaps, to all except the squire\nhimself.\n\nAll this time he was already considerably encumbered. He had spent\nmuch more than he should have done, and so indeed had his wife, in\nthose two splendid years in which they had figured as great among the\ngreat ones of the earth. Fourteen thousand a year ought to have been\nenough to allow a member of Parliament with a young wife and two or\nthree children to live in London and keep up their country family\nmansion; but then the de Courcys were very great people, and Lady\nArabella chose to live as she had been accustomed to do, and as her\nsister-in-law the countess lived: now Lord de Courcy had much more\nthan fourteen thousand a year. Then came the three elections, with\ntheir vast attendant cost, and then those costly expedients to which\ngentlemen are forced to have recourse who have lived beyond their\nincome, and find it impossible so to reduce their establishments as\nto live much below it. Thus when the hounds came to Greshamsbury, Mr\nGresham was already a poor man.\n\nLady Arabella said much to oppose their coming; but Lady Arabella,\nthough it could hardly be said of her that she was under her\nhusband's rule, certainly was not entitled to boast that she had him\nunder hers. She then made her first grand attack as to the furniture\nin Portman Square; and was then for the first time specially informed\nthat the furniture there was not matter of much importance, as she\nwould not in future be required to move her family to that residence\nduring the London seasons. The sort of conversations which grew from\nsuch a commencement may be imagined. Had Lady Arabella worried her\nlord less, he might perhaps have considered with more coolness the\nfolly of encountering so prodigious an increase to the expense of his\nestablishment; had he not spent so much money in a pursuit which his\nwife did not enjoy, she might perhaps have been more sparing in her\nrebukes as to his indifference to her London pleasures. As it was,\nthe hounds came to Greshamsbury, and Lady Arabella did go to London\nfor some period in each year, and the family expenses were by no\nmeans lessened.\n\nThe kennels, however, were now again empty. Two years previous to the\ntime at which our story begins, the hounds had been carried off to\nthe seat of some richer sportsman. This was more felt by Mr Gresham\nthan any other misfortune which he had yet incurred. He had been\nmaster of hounds for ten years, and that work he had at any rate done\nwell. The popularity among his neighbours which he had lost as a\npolitician he had regained as a sportsman, and he would fain have\nremained autocratic in the hunt, had it been possible. But he so\nremained much longer than he should have done, and at last they went\naway, not without signs and sounds of visible joy on the part of Lady\nArabella.\n\nBut we have kept the Greshamsbury tenantry waiting under the\noak-trees by far too long. Yes; when young Frank came of age there\nwas still enough left at Greshamsbury, still means enough at the\nsquire's disposal, to light one bonfire, to roast, whole in its skin,\none bullock. Frank's virility came on him not quite unmarked, as\nthat of the parson's son might do, or the son of the neighbouring\nattorney. It could still be reported in the Barsetshire Conservative\n_Standard_ that \"The beards wagged all\" at Greshamsbury, now as they\nhad done for many centuries on similar festivals. Yes; it was so\nreported. But this, like so many other such reports, had but a shadow\nof truth in it. \"They poured the liquor in,\" certainly, those who\nwere there; but the beards did not wag as they had been wont to wag\nin former years. Beards won't wag for the telling. The squire was at\nhis wits' end for money, and the tenants one and all had so heard.\nRents had been raised on them; timber had fallen fast; the lawyer\non the estate was growing rich; tradesmen in Barchester, nay, in\nGreshamsbury itself, were beginning to mutter; and the squire himself\nwould not be merry. Under such circumstances the throats of a\ntenantry will still swallow, but their beards will not wag.\n\n\"I minds well,\" said Farmer Oaklerath to his neighbour, \"when the\nsquoire hisself comed of age. Lord love 'ee! There was fun going that\nday. There was more yale drank then than's been brewed at the big\nhouse these two years. T'old squoire was a one'er.\"\n\n\"And I minds when squoire was borned; minds it well,\" said an old\nfarmer sitting opposite. \"Them was the days! It an't that long ago\nneither. Squoire a'nt come o' fifty yet; no, nor an't nigh it, though\nhe looks it. Things be altered at Greemsbury\"--such was the rural\npronunciation--\"altered sadly, neebor Oaklerath. Well, well; I'll\nsoon be gone, I will, and so it an't no use talking; but arter paying\none pound fifteen for them acres for more nor fifty year, I didn't\nthink I'd ever be axed for forty shilling.\"\n\nSuch was the style of conversation which went on at the various\ntables. It had certainly been of a very different tone when the\nsquire was born, when he came of age, and when, just two years\nsubsequently, his son had been born. On each of these events similar\nrural f\u00c3\u00aates had been given, and the squire himself had on these\noccasions been frequent among his guests. On the first, he had been\ncarried round by his father, a whole train of ladies and nurses\nfollowing. On the second, he had himself mixed in all the sports, the\ngayest of the gay, and each tenant had squeezed his way up to the\nlawn to get a sight of the Lady Arabella, who, as was already known,\nwas to come from Courcy Castle to Greshamsbury to be their mistress.\nIt was little they any of them cared now for the Lady Arabella. On\nthe third, he himself had borne his child in his arms as his father\nhad before borne him; he was then in the zenith of his pride, and\nthough the tenantry whispered that he was somewhat less familiar with\nthem than of yore, that he had put on somewhat too much of the de\nCourcy airs, still he was their squire, their master, the rich man\nin whose hand they lay. The old squire was then gone, and they were\nproud of the young member and his lady bride in spite of a little\nhauteur. None of them were proud of him now.\n\nHe walked once round among the guests, and spoke a few words of\nwelcome at each table; and as he did so the tenants got up and bowed\nand wished health to the old squire, happiness to the young one, and\nprosperity to Greshamsbury; but, nevertheless, it was but a tame\naffair.\n\nThere were also other visitors, of the gentle sort, to do honour to\nthe occasion; but not such swarms, not such a crowd at the mansion\nitself and at the houses of the neighbouring gentry as had always\nbeen collected on these former gala doings. Indeed, the party at\nGreshamsbury was not a large one, and consisted chiefly of Lady de\nCourcy and her suite. Lady Arabella still kept up, as far as she was\nable, her close connexion with Courcy Castle. She was there as much\nas possible, to which Mr Gresham never objected; and she took her\ndaughters there whenever she could, though, as regarded the two elder\ngirls, she was interfered with by Mr Gresham, and not unfrequently by\nthe girls themselves. Lady Arabella had a pride in her son, though\nhe was by no means her favourite child. He was, however, the heir of\nGreshamsbury, of which fact she was disposed to make the most, and\nhe was also a fine gainly open-hearted young man, who could not but\nbe dear to any mother. Lady Arabella did love him dearly, though she\nfelt a sort of disappointment in regard to him, seeing that he was\nnot so much like a de Courcy as he should have been. She did love him\ndearly; and, therefore, when he came of age she got her sister-in-law\nand all the Ladies Amelia, Rosina etc., to come to Greshamsbury; and\nshe also, with some difficulty, persuaded the Honourable Georges and\nthe Honourable Johns to be equally condescending. Lord de Courcy\nhimself was in attendance at the Court--or said that he was--and Lord\nPorlock, the eldest son, simply told his aunt when he was invited\nthat he never bored himself with those sort of things.\n\nThen there were the Bakers, and the Batesons, and the Jacksons, who\nall lived near and returned home at night; there was the Reverend\nCaleb Oriel, the High-Church rector, with his beautiful sister,\nPatience Oriel; there was Mr Yates Umbleby, the attorney and agent;\nand there was Dr Thorne, and the doctor's modest, quiet-looking\nlittle niece, Miss Mary.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nLong, Long Ago\n\n\nAs Dr Thorne is our hero--or I should rather say my hero, a privilege\nof selecting for themselves in this respect being left to all my\nreaders--and as Miss Mary Thorne is to be our heroine, a point on\nwhich no choice whatsoever is left to any one, it is necessary that\nthey shall be introduced and explained and described in a proper,\nformal manner. I quite feel that an apology is due for beginning a\nnovel with two long dull chapters full of description. I am perfectly\naware of the danger of such a course. In so doing I sin against the\ngolden rule which requires us all to put our best foot foremost, the\nwisdom of which is fully recognised by novelists, myself among the\nnumber. It can hardly be expected that any one will consent to go\nthrough with a fiction that offers so little of allurement in its\nfirst pages; but twist it as I will I cannot do otherwise. I find\nthat I cannot make poor Mr Gresham hem and haw and turn himself\nuneasily in his arm-chair in a natural manner till I have said why\nhe is uneasy. I cannot bring in my doctor speaking his mind freely\namong the bigwigs till I have explained that it is in accordance\nwith his usual character to do so. This is unartistic on my part,\nand shows want of imagination as well as want of skill. Whether or\nnot I can atone for these faults by straightforward, simple, plain\nstory-telling--that, indeed, is very doubtful.\n\nDr Thorne belonged to a family in one sense as good, and at any rate\nas old, as that of Mr Gresham; and much older, he was apt to boast,\nthan that of the de Courcys. This trait in his character is mentioned\nfirst, as it was the weakness for which he was most conspicuous. He\nwas second cousin to Mr Thorne of Ullathorne, a Barsetshire squire\nliving in the neighbourhood of Barchester, and who boasted that his\nestate had remained in his family, descending from Thorne to Thorne,\nlonger than had been the case with any other estate or any other\nfamily in the county.\n\nBut Dr Thorne was only a second cousin; and, therefore, though he was\nentitled to talk of the blood as belonging to some extent to himself,\nhe had no right to lay claim to any position in the county other than\nsuch as he might win for himself if he chose to locate himself in it.\nThis was a fact of which no one was more fully aware than our doctor\nhimself. His father, who had been first cousin of a former Squire\nThorne, had been a clerical dignitary in Barchester, but had been\ndead now many years. He had had two sons; one he had educated as a\nmedical man, but the other, and the younger, whom he had intended\nfor the Bar, had not betaken himself in any satisfactory way to any\ncalling. This son had been first rusticated from Oxford, and then\nexpelled; and thence returning to Barchester, had been the cause to\nhis father and brother of much suffering.\n\nOld Dr Thorne, the clergyman, died when the two brothers were yet\nyoung men, and left behind him nothing but some household and\nother property of the value of about two thousand pounds, which he\nbequeathed to Thomas, the elder son, much more than that having been\nspent in liquidating debts contracted by the younger. Up to that time\nthere had been close harmony between the Ullathorne family and that\nof the clergyman; but a month or two before the doctor's death--the\nperiod of which we are speaking was about two-and-twenty years before\nthe commencement of our story--the then Mr Thorne of Ullathorne had\nmade it understood that he would no longer receive at his house his\ncousin Henry, whom he regarded as a disgrace to the family.\n\nFathers are apt to be more lenient to their sons than uncles to their\nnephews, or cousins to each other. Dr Thorne still hoped to reclaim\nhis black sheep, and thought that the head of his family showed an\nunnecessary harshness in putting an obstacle in his way of doing so.\nAnd if the father was warm in support of his profligate son, the\nyoung medical aspirant was warmer in support of his profligate\nbrother. Dr Thorne, junior, was no rou\u00c3\u00a9 himself, but perhaps, as a\nyoung man, he had not sufficient abhorrence of his brother's vices.\nAt any rate, he stuck to him manfully; and when it was signified\nin the Close that Henry's company was not considered desirable at\nUllathorne, Dr Thomas Thorne sent word to the squire that under such\ncircumstances his visits there would also cease.\n\nThis was not very prudent, as the young Galen had elected to\nestablish himself in Barchester, very mainly in expectation of the\nhelp which his Ullathorne connexion would give him. This, however, in\nhis anger he failed to consider; he was never known, either in early\nor in middle life, to consider in his anger those points which were\nprobably best worth his consideration. This, perhaps, was of the less\nmoment as his anger was of an unenduring kind, evaporating frequently\nwith more celerity than he could get the angry words out of his\nmouth. With the Ullathorne people, however, he did establish a\nquarrel sufficiently permanent to be of vital injury to his medical\nprospects.\n\nAnd then the father died, and the two brothers were left living\ntogether with very little means between them. At this time there\nwere living, in Barchester, people of the name of Scatcherd. Of that\nfamily, as then existing, we have only to do with two, a brother and\na sister. They were in a low rank of life, the one being a journeyman\nstone-mason, and the other an apprentice to a straw-bonnet maker; but\nthey were, nevertheless, in some sort remarkable people. The sister\nwas reputed in Barchester to be a model of female beauty of the\nstrong and robuster cast, and had also a better reputation as being\na girl of good character and honest, womanly conduct. Both of her\nbeauty and of her reputation her brother was exceedingly proud, and\nhe was the more so when he learnt that she had been asked in marriage\nby a decent master-tradesman in the city.\n\nRoger Scatcherd had also a reputation, but not for beauty or\npropriety of conduct. He was known for the best stone-mason in the\nfour counties, and as the man who could, on occasion, drink the most\nalcohol in a given time in the same localities. As a workman, indeed,\nhe had higher reputate even than this: he was not only a good and\nvery quick stone-mason, but he had also a capacity for turning other\nmen into good stone-masons: he had a gift of knowing what a man could\nand should do; and, by degrees, he taught himself what five, and ten,\nand twenty--latterly, what a thousand and two thousand men might\naccomplish among them: this, also, he did with very little aid\nfrom pen and paper, with which he was not, and never became, very\nconversant. He had also other gifts and other propensities. He could\ntalk in a manner dangerous to himself and others; he could persuade\nwithout knowing that he did so; and being himself an extreme\ndemagogue, in those noisy times just prior to the Reform Bill,\nhe created a hubbub in Barchester of which he himself had had no\nprevious conception.\n\nHenry Thorne among his other bad qualities had one which his friends\nregarded as worse than all the others, and which perhaps justified\nthe Ullathorne people in their severity. He loved to consort with\nlow people. He not only drank--that might have been forgiven--but he\ndrank in tap-rooms with vulgar drinkers; so said his friends, and so\nsaid his enemies. He denied the charge as being made in the plural\nnumber, and declared that his only low co-reveller was Roger\nScatcherd. With Roger Scatcherd, at any rate, he associated, and\nbecame as democratic as Roger was himself. Now the Thornes of\nUllathorne were of the very highest order of Tory excellence.\n\nWhether or not Mary Scatcherd at once accepted the offer of the\nrespectable tradesman, I cannot say. After the occurrence of certain\nevents which must here shortly be told, she declared that she never\nhad done so. Her brother averred that she most positively had. The\nrespectable tradesman himself refused to speak on the subject.\n\nIt is certain, however, that Scatcherd, who had hitherto been silent\nenough about his sister in those social hours which he passed with\nhis gentleman friend, boasted of the engagement when it was, as he\nsaid, made; and then boasted also of the girl's beauty. Scatcherd, in\nspite of his occasional intemperance, looked up in the world, and the\ncoming marriage of his sister was, he thought, suitable to his own\nambition for his family.\n\nHenry Thorne had already heard of, and already seen, Mary Scatcherd;\nbut hitherto she had not fallen in the way of his wickedness. Now,\nhowever, when he heard that she was to be decently married, the devil\ntempted him to tempt her. It boots not to tell all the tale. It came\nout clearly enough when all was told, that he made her most distinct\npromises of marriage; he even gave her such in writing; and having\nin this way obtained from her her company during some of her little\nholidays--her Sundays or summer evenings--he seduced her. Scatcherd\naccused him openly of having intoxicated her with drugs; and Thomas\nThorne, who took up the case, ultimately believed the charge. It\nbecame known in Barchester that she was with child, and that the\nseducer was Henry Thorne.\n\nRoger Scatcherd, when the news first reached him, filled himself with\ndrink, and then swore that he would kill them both. With manly wrath,\nhowever, he set forth, first against the man, and that with manly\nweapons. He took nothing with him but his fists and a big stick as he\nwent in search of Henry Thorne.\n\nThe two brothers were then lodging together at a farm-house close\nabutting on the town. This was not an eligible abode for a medical\npractitioner; but the young doctor had not been able to settle\nhimself eligibly since his father's death; and wishing to put what\nconstraint he could upon his brother, had so located himself. To this\nfarm-house came Roger Scatcherd one sultry summer evening, his anger\ngleaming from his bloodshot eyes, and his rage heightened to madness\nby the rapid pace at which he had run from the city, and by the\nardent spirits which were fermenting within him.\n\nAt the very gate of the farm-yard, standing placidly with his\ncigar in his mouth, he encountered Henry Thorne. He had thought\nof searching for him through the whole premises, of demanding his\nvictim with loud exclamations, and making his way to him through\nall obstacles. In lieu of that, there stood the man before him.\n\n\"Well, Roger, what's in the wind?\" said Henry Thorne.\n\nThey were the last words he ever spoke. He was answered by a blow\nfrom the blackthorn. A contest ensued, which ended in Scatcherd\nkeeping his word--at any rate, as regarded the worst offender. How\nthe fatal blow on the temple was struck was never exactly determined:\none medical man said it might have been done in a fight with a\nheavy-headed stick; another thought that a stone had been used; a\nthird suggested a stone-mason's hammer. It seemed, however, to be\nproved subsequently that no hammer was taken out, and Scatcherd\nhimself persisted in declaring that he had taken in his hand no\nweapon but the stick. Scatcherd, however, was drunk; and even though\nhe intended to tell the truth, may have been mistaken. There were,\nhowever, the facts that Thorne was dead; that Scatcherd had sworn\nto kill him about an hour previously; and that he had without delay\naccomplished his threat. He was arrested and tried for murder; all\nthe distressing circumstances of the case came out on the trial: he\nwas found guilty of manslaughter, and sentenced to be imprisoned for\nsix months. Our readers will probably think that the punishment was\ntoo severe.\n\nThomas Thorne and the farmer were on the spot soon after Henry Thorne\nhad fallen. The brother was at first furious for vengeance against\nhis brother's murderer; but, as the facts came out, as he learnt\nwhat had been the provocation given, what had been the feelings of\nScatcherd when he left the city, determined to punish him who had\nruined his sister, his heart was changed. Those were trying days for\nhim. It behoved him to do what in him lay to cover his brother's\nmemory from the obloquy which it deserved; it behoved him also to\nsave, or to assist to save, from undue punishment the unfortunate man\nwho had shed his brother's blood; and it behoved him also, at least\nso he thought, to look after that poor fallen one whose misfortunes\nwere less merited than those either of his brother or of hers.\n\nAnd he was not the man to get through these things lightly, or with\nas much ease as he perhaps might conscientiously have done. He would\npay for the defence of the prisoner; he would pay for the defence of\nhis brother's memory; and he would pay for the poor girl's comforts.\nHe would do this, and he would allow no one to help him. He stood\nalone in the world, and insisted on so standing. Old Mr Thorne\nof Ullathorne offered again to open his arms to him; but he had\nconceived a foolish idea that his cousin's severity had driven his\nbrother on to his bad career, and he would consequently accept no\nkindness from Ullathorne. Miss Thorne, the old squire's daughter--a\ncousin considerably older than himself, to whom he had at one time\nbeen much attached--sent him money; and he returned it to her under a\nblank cover. He had still enough for those unhappy purposes which he\nhad in hand. As to what might happen afterwards, he was then mainly\nindifferent.\n\nThe affair made much noise in the county, and was inquired into\nclosely by many of the county magistrates; by none more closely than\nby John Newbold Gresham, who was then alive. Mr Gresham was greatly\ntaken with the energy and justice shown by Dr Thorne on the occasion;\nand when the trial was over, he invited him to Greshamsbury. The\nvisit ended in the doctor establishing himself in that village.\n\nWe must return for a moment to Mary Scatcherd. She was saved from the\nnecessity of encountering her brother's wrath, for that brother was\nunder arrest for murder before he could get at her. Her immediate\nlot, however, was a cruel one. Deep as was her cause for anger\nagainst the man who had so inhumanly used her, still it was natural\nthat she should turn to him with love rather than with aversion. To\nwhom else could she in such plight look for love? When, therefore,\nshe heard that he was slain, her heart sank within her; she turned\nher face to the wall, and laid herself down to die: to die a double\ndeath, for herself and the fatherless babe that was now quick within\nher.\n\nBut, in fact, life had still much to offer, both to her and to her\nchild. For her it was still destined that she should, in a distant\nland, be the worthy wife of a good husband, and the happy mother of\nmany children. For that embryo one it was destined--but that may not\nbe so quickly told: to describe her destiny this volume has yet to be\nwritten.\n\nEven in those bitterest days God tempered the wind to the shorn\nlamb. Dr Thorne was by her bedside soon after the bloody tidings\nhad reached her, and did for her more than either her lover or her\nbrother could have done. When the baby was born, Scatcherd was still\nin prison, and had still three months' more confinement to undergo.\nThe story of her great wrongs and cruel usage was much talked of,\nand men said that one who had been so injured should be regarded as\nhaving in nowise sinned at all.\n\nOne man, at any rate, so thought. At twilight, one evening, Thorne\nwas surprised by a visit from a demure Barchester hardware dealer,\nwhom he did not remember ever to have addressed before. This was the\nformer lover of poor Mary Scatcherd. He had a proposal to make, and\nit was this:--if Mary would consent to leave the country at once, to\nleave it without notice from her brother, or talk or \u00c3\u00a9clat on the\nmatter, he would sell all that he had, marry her, and emigrate.\nThere was but one condition; she must leave her baby behind her.\nThe hardware-man could find it in his heart to be generous, to be\ngenerous and true to his love; but he could not be generous enough to\nfather the seducer's child.\n\n\"I could never abide it, sir, if I took it,\" said he; \"and she,--why\nin course she would always love it the best.\"\n\nIn praising his generosity, who can mingle any censure for such\nmanifest prudence? He would still make her the wife of his bosom,\ndefiled in the eyes of the world as she had been; but she must be\nto him the mother of his own children, not the mother of another's\nchild.\n\nAnd now again our doctor had a hard task to win through. He saw at\nonce that it was his duty to use his utmost authority to induce the\npoor girl to accept such an offer. She liked the man; and here was\nopened to her a course which would have been most desirable, even\nbefore her misfortune. But it is hard to persuade a mother to part\nwith her first babe; harder, perhaps, when the babe had been so\nfathered and so born than when the world has shone brightly on its\nearliest hours. She at first refused stoutly: she sent a thousand\nloves, a thousand thanks, profusest acknowledgements for his\ngenerosity to the man who showed her that he loved her so well; but\nNature, she said, would not let her leave her child.\n\n\"And what will you do for her here, Mary?\" said the doctor. Poor Mary\nreplied to him with a deluge of tears.\n\n\"She is my niece,\" said the doctor, taking up the tiny infant in his\nhuge hands; \"she is already the nearest thing, the only thing that I\nhave in this world. I am her uncle, Mary. If you will go with this\nman I will be father to her and mother to her. Of what bread I eat,\nshe shall eat; of what cup I drink, she shall drink. See, Mary, here\nis the Bible;\" and he covered the book with his hand. \"Leave her to\nme, and by this word she shall be my child.\"\n\nThe mother consented at last; left her baby with the doctor, married,\nand went to America. All this was consummated before Roger Scatcherd\nwas liberated from jail. Some conditions the doctor made. The first\nwas, that Scatcherd should not know his sister's child was thus\ndisposed of. Dr Thorne, in undertaking to bring up the baby, did not\nchoose to encounter any tie with persons who might hereafter claim\nto be the girl's relations on the other side. Relations she would\nundoubtedly have had none had she been left to live or die as a\nworkhouse bastard; but should the doctor succeed in life, should he\nultimately be able to make this girl the darling of his own house,\nand then the darling of some other house, should she live and win the\nheart of some man whom the doctor might delight to call his friend\nand nephew; then relations might spring up whose ties would not be\nadvantageous.\n\nNo man plumed himself on good blood more than Dr Thorne; no man had\ngreater pride in his genealogical tree, and his hundred and thirty\nclearly proved descents from MacAdam; no man had a stronger theory\nas to the advantage held by men who have grandfathers over those who\nhave none, or have none worth talking about. Let it not be thought\nthat our doctor was a perfect character. No, indeed; most far from\nperfect. He had within him an inner, stubborn, self-admiring pride,\nwhich made him believe himself to be better and higher than those\naround him, and this from some unknown cause which he could hardly\nexplain to himself. He had a pride in being a poor man of a high\nfamily; he had a pride in repudiating the very family of which he\nwas proud; and he had a special pride in keeping his pride silently\nto himself. His father had been a Thorne, and his mother a Thorold.\nThere was no better blood to be had in England. It was in the\npossession of such properties as these that he condescended to\nrejoice; this man, with a man's heart, a man's courage, and a man's\nhumanity! Other doctors round the county had ditch-water in their\nveins; he could boast of a pure ichor, to which that of the great\nOmnium family was but a muddy puddle. It was thus that he loved to\nexcel his brother practitioners, he who might have indulged in the\npride of excelling them both in talent and in energy! We speak now\nof his early days; but even in his maturer life, the man, though\nmellowed, was the same.\n\nThis was the man who now promised to take to his bosom as his own\nchild a poor bastard whose father was already dead, and whose\nmother's family was such as the Scatcherds! It was necessary that\nthe child's history should be known to none. Except to the mother's\nbrother it was an object of interest to no one. The mother had for\nsome short time been talked of; but now the nine-days' wonder was a\nwonder no longer. She went off to her far-away home; her husband's\ngenerosity was duly chronicled in the papers, and the babe was left\nuntalked of and unknown.\n\nIt was easy to explain to Scatcherd that the child had not lived.\nThere was a parting interview between the brother and sister in the\njail, during which, with real tears and unaffected sorrow, the mother\nthus accounted for the offspring of her shame. Then she started,\nfortunate in her coming fortunes; and the doctor took with him his\ncharge to the new country in which they were both to live. There he\nfound for her a fitting home till she should be old enough to sit\nat his table and live in his bachelor house; and no one but old Mr\nGresham knew who she was, or whence she had come.\n\nThen Roger Scatcherd, having completed his six months' confinement,\ncame out of prison.\n\nRoger Scatcherd, though his hands were now red with blood, was to be\npitied. A short time before the days of Henry Thorne's death he had\nmarried a young wife in his own class of life, and had made many\nresolves that henceforward his conduct should be such as might become\na married man, and might not disgrace the respectable brother-in-law\nhe was about to have given him. Such was his condition when he first\nheard of his sister's plight. As has been said, he filled himself\nwith drink and started off on the scent of blood.\n\nDuring his prison days his wife had to support herself as she might.\nThe decent articles of furniture which they had put together were\nsold; she gave up their little house, and, bowed down by misery, she\nalso was brought near to death. When he was liberated he at once got\nwork; but those who have watched the lives of such people know how\nhard it is for them to recover lost ground. She became a mother\nimmediately after his liberation, and when her child was born they\nwere in direst want; for Scatcherd was again drinking, and his\nresolves were blown to the wind.\n\nThe doctor was then living at Greshamsbury. He had gone over there\nbefore the day on which he undertook the charge of poor Mary's baby,\nand soon found himself settled as the Greshamsbury doctor. This\noccurred very soon after the birth of the young heir. His predecessor\nin this career had \"bettered\" himself, or endeavoured to do so, by\nseeking the practice of some large town, and Lady Arabella, at a very\ncritical time, was absolutely left with no other advice than that of\na stranger, picked up, as she declared to Lady de Courcy, somewhere\nabout Barchester jail, or Barchester court-house, she did not know\nwhich.\n\nOf course Lady Arabella could not suckle the young heir herself.\nLadies Arabella never can. They are gifted with the powers of being\nmothers, but not nursing-mothers. Nature gives them bosoms for show,\nbut not for use. So Lady Arabella had a wet-nurse. At the end of six\nmonths the new doctor found Master Frank was not doing quite so well\nas he should do; and after a little trouble it was discovered that\nthe very excellent young woman who had been sent express from Courcy\nCastle to Greshamsbury--a supply being kept up on the lord's demesne\nfor the family use--was fond of brandy. She was at once sent back to\nthe castle, of course; and, as Lady de Courcy was too much in dudgeon\nto send another, Dr Thorne was allowed to procure one. He thought of\nthe misery of Roger Scatcherd's wife, thought also of her health,\nand strength, and active habits; and thus Mrs Scatcherd became the\nfoster-mother to young Frank Gresham.\n\nOne other episode we must tell of past times. Previous to his\nfather's death, Dr Thorne was in love. Nor had he altogether sighed\nand pleaded in vain; though it had not quite come to that, that the\nyoung lady's friends, or even the young lady herself, had actually\naccepted his suit. At that time his name stood well in Barchester.\nHis father was a prebendary; his cousins and his best friends were\nthe Thornes of Ullathorne, and the lady, who shall be nameless, was\nnot thought to be injudicious in listening to the young doctor. But\nwhen Henry Thorne went so far astray, when the old doctor died, when\nthe young doctor quarrelled with Ullathorne, when the brother was\nkilled in a disgraceful quarrel, and it turned out that the physician\nhad nothing but his profession and no settled locality in which to\nexercise it; then, indeed, the young lady's friends thought that she\nwas injudicious, and the young lady herself had not spirit enough, or\nlove enough, to be disobedient. In those stormy days of the trial she\ntold Dr Thorne that perhaps it would be wise that they should not see\neach other any more.\n\nDr Thorne, so counselled, at such a moment,--so informed then, when\nhe most required comfort from his love, at once swore loudly that he\nagreed with her. He rushed forth with a bursting heart, and said to\nhimself that the world was bad, all bad. He saw the lady no more;\nand, if I am rightly informed, never again made matrimonial overtures\nto any one.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nDr Thorne\n\n\nAnd thus Dr Thorne became settled for life in the little village of\nGreshamsbury. As was then the wont with many country practitioners,\nand as should be the wont with them all if they consulted their own\ndignity a little less and the comforts of their customers somewhat\nmore, he added the business of a dispensing apothecary to that of\nphysician. In doing so, he was of course much reviled. Many people\naround him declared that he could not truly be a doctor, or, at any\nrate, a doctor to be so called; and his brethren in the art living\naround him, though they knew that his diplomas, degrees, and\ncertificates were all _en r\u00c3\u00a8gle_, rather countenanced the report.\nThere was much about this new-comer which did not endear him to his\nown profession. In the first place he was a new-comer, and, as such,\nwas of course to be regarded by other doctors as being _de trop_.\nGreshamsbury was only fifteen miles from Barchester, where there was\na regular d\u00c3\u00a9p\u00c3\u00b4t of medical skill, and but eight from Silverbridge,\nwhere a properly established physician had been in residence for the\nlast forty years. Dr Thorne's predecessor at Greshamsbury had been a\nhumble-minded general practitioner, gifted with a due respect for\nthe physicians of the county; and he, though he had been allowed to\nphysic the servants, and sometimes the children of Greshamsbury, had\nnever had the presumption to put himself on a par with his betters.\n\nThen, also, Dr Thorne, though a graduated physician, though entitled\nbeyond all dispute to call himself a doctor, according to all the\nlaws of all the colleges, made it known to the East Barsetshire\nworld, very soon after he had seated himself at Greshamsbury, that\nhis rate of pay was to be seven-and-sixpence a visit within a\ncircuit of five miles, with a proportionally increased charge at\nproportionally increased distances. Now there was something low,\nmean, unprofessional, and democratic in this; so, at least, said the\nchildren of \u00c3\u0086sculapius gathered together in conclave at Barchester.\nIn the first place, it showed that this Thorne was always thinking\nof his money, like an apothecary, as he was; whereas, it would have\nbehoved him, as a physician, had he had the feelings of a physician\nunder his hat, to have regarded his own pursuits in a purely\nphilosophical spirit, and to have taken any gain which might have\naccrued as an accidental adjunct to his station in life. A physician\nshould take his fee without letting his left hand know what his right\nhand was doing; it should be taken without a thought, without a look,\nwithout a move of the facial muscles; the true physician should\nhardly be aware that the last friendly grasp of the hand had been\nmade more precious by the touch of gold. Whereas, that fellow Thorne\nwould lug out half a crown from his breeches pocket and give it in\nchange for a ten shilling piece. And then it was clear that this man\nhad no appreciation of the dignity of a learned profession. He might\nconstantly be seen compounding medicines in the shop, at the left\nhand of his front door; not making experiments philosophically in\nmateria medica for the benefit of coming ages--which, if he did, he\nshould have done in the seclusion of his study, far from profane\neyes--but positively putting together common powders for rural\nbowels, or spreading vulgar ointments for agricultural ailments.\n\nA man of this sort was not fit society for Dr Fillgrave of\nBarchester. That must be admitted. And yet he had been found to be\nfit society for the old squire of Greshamsbury, whose shoe-ribbons Dr\nFillgrave would not have objected to tie; so high did the old squire\nstand in the county just previous to his death. But the spirit of the\nLady Arabella was known by the medical profession of Barsetshire, and\nwhen that good man died it was felt that Thorne's short tenure of\nGreshamsbury favour was already over. The Barsetshire regulars were,\nhowever, doomed to disappointment. Our doctor had already contrived\nto endear himself to the heir; and though there was not even then\nmuch personal love between him and the Lady Arabella, he kept his\nplace at the great house unmoved, not only in the nursery and in the\nbedrooms, but also at the squire's dining-table.\n\nNow there was in this, it must be admitted, quite enough to make him\nunpopular with his brethren; and this feeling was soon shown in a\nmarked and dignified manner. Dr Fillgrave, who had certainly the\nmost respectable professional connexion in the county, who had a\nreputation to maintain, and who was accustomed to meet, on almost\nequal terms, the great medical baronets from the metropolis at the\nhouses of the nobility--Dr Fillgrave declined to meet Dr Thorne in\nconsultation. He exceedingly regretted, he said, most exceedingly,\nthe necessity which he felt of doing so: he had never before had\nto perform so painful a duty; but, as a duty which he owed to his\nprofession, he must perform it. With every feeling of respect for\nLady ----, a sick guest at Greshamsbury--and for Mr Gresham, he must\ndecline to attend in conjunction with Dr Thorne. If his services\ncould be made available under any other circumstances, he would go to\nGreshamsbury as fast as post-horses could carry him.\n\nThen, indeed, there was war in Barsetshire. If there was on Dr\nThorne's cranium one bump more developed than another, it was that of\ncombativeness. Not that the doctor was a bully, or even pugnacious,\nin the usual sense of the word; he had no disposition to provoke a\nfight, no propense love of quarrelling; but there was that in him\nwhich would allow him to yield to no attack. Neither in argument nor\nin contest would he ever allow himself to be wrong; never at least to\nany one but to himself; and on behalf of his special hobbies, he was\nready to meet the world at large.\n\nIt will therefore be understood, that when such a gauntlet was thus\nthrown in his very teeth by Dr Fillgrave, he was not slow to take it\nup. He addressed a letter to the Barsetshire Conservative _Standard_,\nin which he attacked Dr Fillgrave with some considerable acerbity.\nDr Fillgrave responded in four lines, saying that on mature\nconsideration he had made up his mind not to notice any remarks\nthat might be made on him by Dr Thorne in the public press. The\nGreshamsbury doctor then wrote another letter, more witty and much\nmore severe than the last; and as this was copied into the Bristol,\nExeter, and Gloucester papers, Dr Fillgrave found it very difficult\nto maintain the magnanimity of his reticence. It is sometimes\nbecoming enough for a man to wrap himself in the dignified toga of\nsilence, and proclaim himself indifferent to public attacks; but it\nis a sort of dignity which it is very difficult to maintain. As well\nmight a man, when stung to madness by wasps, endeavour to sit in his\nchair without moving a muscle, as endure with patience and without\nreply the courtesies of a newspaper opponent. Dr Thorne wrote a third\nletter, which was too much for medical flesh and blood to bear. Dr\nFillgrave answered it, not, indeed, in his own name, but in that of\na brother doctor; and then the war raged merrily. It is hardly too\nmuch to say that Dr Fillgrave never knew another happy hour. Had he\ndreamed of what materials was made that young compounder of doses at\nGreshamsbury he would have met him in consultation, morning, noon,\nand night, without objection; but having begun the war, he was\nconstrained to go on with it: his brethren would allow him no\nalternative. Thus he was continually being brought up to the fight,\nas a prize-fighter may be seen to be, who is carried up round after\nround, without any hope on his own part, and who, in each round,\ndrops to the ground before the very wind of his opponent's blows.\n\nBut Dr Fillgrave, though thus weak himself, was backed in practice\nand in countenance by nearly all his brethren in the county. The\nguinea fee, the principle of _giving_ advice and of selling no\nmedicine, the great resolve to keep a distinct barrier between\nthe physician and the apothecary, and, above all, the hatred of\nthe contamination of a bill, were strong in the medical mind of\nBarsetshire. Dr Thorne had the provincial medical world against him,\nand so he appealed to the metropolis. The _Lancet_ took the matter up\nin his favour, but the _Journal of Medical Science_ was against him;\nthe _Weekly Chirurgeon_, noted for its medical democracy, upheld him\nas a medical prophet, but the _Scalping Knife_, a monthly periodical\ngot up in dead opposition to the _Lancet_, showed him no mercy. So\nthe war went on, and our doctor, to a certain extent, became a noted\ncharacter.\n\nHe had, moreover, other difficulties to encounter in his professional\ncareer. It was something in his favour that he understood his\nbusiness; something that he was willing to labour at it with energy;\nand resolved to labour at it conscientiously. He had also other\ngifts, such as conversational brilliancy, an aptitude for true\ngood fellowship, firmness in friendship, and general honesty of\ndisposition, which stood him in stead as he advanced in life. But,\nat his first starting, much that belonged to himself personally was\nagainst him. Let him enter what house he would, he entered it with a\nconviction, often expressed to himself, that he was equal as a man to\nthe proprietor, equal as a human being to the proprietress. To age he\nwould allow deference, and to special recognised talent--at least so\nhe said; to rank also, he would pay that respect which was its clear\nand recognised prerogative; he would let a lord walk out of a room\nbefore him if he did not happen to forget it; in speaking to a duke\nhe would address him as his Grace; and he would in no way assume a\nfamiliarity with bigger men than himself, allowing to the bigger man\nthe privilege of making the first advances. But beyond this he would\nadmit that no man should walk the earth with his head higher than his\nown.\n\nHe did not talk of these things much; he offended no rank by boasts\nof his own equality; he did not absolutely tell the Earl de Courcy in\nwords, that the privilege of dining at Courcy Castle was to him no\ngreater than the privilege of dining at Courcy Parsonage; but there\nwas that in his manner that told it. The feeling in itself was\nperhaps good, and was certainly much justified by the manner in which\nhe bore himself to those below him in rank; but there was folly in\nthe resolution to run counter to the world's recognised rules on such\nmatters; and much absurdity in his mode of doing so, seeing that at\nheart he was a thorough Conservative. It is hardly too much to say\nthat he naturally hated a lord at first sight; but, nevertheless, he\nwould have expended his means, his blood, and spirit, in fighting for\nthe upper house of Parliament.\n\nSuch a disposition, until it was thoroughly understood, did not tend\nto ingratiate him with the wives of the country gentlemen among whom\nhe had to look for practice. And then, also, there was not much in\nhis individual manner to recommend him to the favour of ladies. He\nwas brusque, authoritative, given to contradiction, rough though\nnever dirty in his personal belongings, and inclined to indulge\nin a sort of quiet raillery, which sometimes was not thoroughly\nunderstood. People did not always know whether he was laughing\nat them or with them; and some people were, perhaps, inclined to\nthink that a doctor should not laugh at all when called in to act\ndoctorially.\n\nWhen he was known, indeed, when the core of the fruit had been\nreached, when the huge proportions of that loving trusting heart had\nbeen learned, and understood, and appreciated, when that honesty had\nbeen recognised, that manly, and almost womanly tenderness had been\nfelt, then, indeed, the doctor was acknowledged to be adequate in his\nprofession. To trifling ailments he was too often brusque. Seeing\nthat he accepted money for the cure of such, he should, we may say,\nhave cured them without an offensive manner. So far he is without\ndefence. But to real suffering no one found him brusque; no patient\nlying painfully on a bed of sickness ever thought him rough.\n\nAnother misfortune was, that he was a bachelor. Ladies think, and\nI, for one, think that ladies are quite right in so thinking, that\ndoctors should be married men. All the world feels that a man when\nmarried acquires some of the attributes of an old woman--he becomes,\nto a certain extent, a motherly sort of being; he acquires a\nconversance with women's ways and women's wants, and loses the wilder\nand offensive sparks of his virility. It must be easier to talk to\nsuch a one about Matilda's stomach, and the growing pains in Fanny's\nlegs, than to a young bachelor. This impediment also stood much in Dr\nThorne's way during his first years at Greshamsbury.\n\nBut his wants were not at first great; and though his ambition was\nperhaps high, it was not of an impatient nature. The world was his\noyster; but, circumstanced as he was, he knew that it was not for him\nto open it with his lancet all at once. He had bread to earn, which\nhe must earn wearily; he had a character to make, which must come\nslowly; it satisfied his soul that, in addition to his immortal\nhopes, he had a possible future in this world to which he could look\nforward with clear eyes, and advance with a heart that would know no\nfainting.\n\nOn his first arrival at Greshamsbury he had been put by the squire\ninto a house, which he still occupied when that squire's grandson\ncame of age. There were two decent, commodious, private houses in the\nvillage--always excepting the rectory, which stood grandly in its own\ngrounds, and, therefore, was considered as ranking above the village\nresidences--of these two Dr Thorne had the smaller. They stood\nexactly at the angle before described, on the outer side of it, and\nat right angles to each other. They both possessed good stables and\nample gardens; and it may be as well to specify, that Mr Umbleby, the\nagent and lawyer to the estate, occupied the larger one.\n\nHere Dr Thorne lived for eleven or twelve years, all alone; and\nthen for ten or eleven more with his niece, Mary Thorne. Mary was\nthirteen when she came to take up permanent abode as mistress of the\nestablishment--or, at any rate, to act as the only mistress which the\nestablishment possessed. This advent greatly changed the tenor of\nthe doctor's ways. He had been before pure bachelor; not a room in\nhis house had been comfortably furnished; he at first commenced in a\nmakeshift sort of way, because he had not at his command the means of\ncommencing otherwise; and he had gone on in the same fashion, because\nthe exact time had never come at which it was imperative in him to\nset his house in order. He had had no fixed hour for his meals, no\nfixed place for his books, no fixed wardrobe for his clothes. He had\na few bottles of good wine in his cellar, and occasionally asked a\nbrother bachelor to take a chop with him; but beyond this he had\ntouched very little on the cares of housekeeping. A slop-bowl full of\nstrong tea, together with bread, and butter, and eggs, was produced\nfor him in the morning, and he expected that at whatever hour he\nmight arrive in the evening, some food should be presented to him\nwherewith to satisfy the cravings of nature; if, in addition to this,\nhe had another slop-bowl of tea in the evening, he got all that he\never required, or all, at least, that he ever demanded.\n\nBut when Mary came, or rather, when she was about to come, things\nwere altogether changed at the doctor's. People had hitherto\nwondered--and especially Mrs Umbleby--how a gentleman like Dr Thorne\ncould continue to live in so slovenly a manner; and how people again\nwondered, and again especially Mrs Umbleby, how the doctor could\npossibly think it necessary to put such a lot of furniture into a\nhouse because a little chit of a girl of twelve years of age was\ncoming to live with him.\n\nMrs Umbleby had great scope for her wonder. The doctor made a\nthorough revolution in his household, and furnished his house from\nthe ground to the roof completely. He painted--for the first time\nsince the commencement of his tenancy--he papered, he carpeted, and\ncurtained, and mirrored, and linened, and blanketed, as though a Mrs\nThorne with a good fortune were coming home to-morrow; and all for a\ngirl of twelve years old. \"And how,\" said Mrs Umbleby, to her friend\nMiss Gushing, \"how did he find out what to buy?\" as though the doctor\nhad been brought up like a wild beast, ignorant of the nature of\ntables and chairs, and with no more developed ideas of drawing-room\ndrapery than an hippopotamus.\n\nTo the utter amazement of Mrs Umbleby and Miss Gushing, the doctor\ndid it all very well. He said nothing about it to any one--he never\ndid say much about such things--but he furnished his house well and\ndiscreetly; and when Mary Thorne came home from her school at Bath,\nto which she had been taken some six years previously, she found\nherself called upon to be the presiding genius of a perfect paradise.\n\nIt has been said that the doctor had managed to endear himself to the\nnew squire before the old squire's death, and that, therefore, the\nchange at Greshamsbury had had no professional ill effects upon him.\nSuch was the case at the time; but, nevertheless, all did not go\nsmoothly in the Greshamsbury medical department. There was six or\nseven years' difference in age between Mr Gresham and the doctor,\nand, moreover, Mr Gresham was young for his age, and the doctor old;\nbut, nevertheless, there was a very close attachment between them\nearly in life. This was never thoroughly sundered, and, backed by\nthis, the doctor did maintain himself for some years before the\nfire of Lady Arabella's artillery. But drops falling, if they fall\nconstantly, will bore through a stone.\n\nDr Thorne's pretensions, mixed with his subversive professional\ndemocratic tendencies, his seven-and-sixpenny visits, added to his\nutter disregard of Lady Arabella's airs, were too much for her\nspirit. He brought Frank through his first troubles, and that at\nfirst ingratiated her; he was equally successful with the early\ndietary of Augusta and Beatrice; but, as his success was obtained\nin direct opposition to the Courcy Castle nursery principles, this\nhardly did much in his favour. When the third daughter was born,\nhe at once declared that she was a very weakly flower, and sternly\nforbade the mother to go to London. The mother, loving her babe,\nobeyed; but did not the less hate the doctor for the order, which\nshe firmly believed was given at the instance and express dictation\nof Mr Gresham. Then another little girl came into the world, and the\ndoctor was more imperative than ever as to the nursery rules and the\nexcellence of country air. Quarrels were thus engendered, and Lady\nArabella was taught to believe that this doctor of her husband's\nwas after all no Solomon. In her husband's absence she sent for Dr\nFillgrave, giving very express intimation that he would not have to\nwound either his eyes or dignity by encountering his enemy; and she\nfound Dr Fillgrave a great comfort to her.\n\nThen Dr Thorne gave Mr Gresham to understand that, under such\ncircumstances, he could not visit professionally at Greshamsbury\nany longer. The poor squire saw there was no help for it, and though\nhe still maintained his friendly connexion with his neighbour,\nthe seven-and-sixpenny visits were at an end. Dr Fillgrave from\nBarchester, and the gentleman at Silverbridge, divided the\nresponsibility between them, and the nursery principles of Courcy\nCastle were again in vogue at Greshamsbury.\n\nSo things went on for years, and those years were years of sorrow.\nWe must not ascribe to our doctor's enemies the sufferings, and\nsickness, and deaths that occurred. The four frail little ones that\ndied would probably have been taken had Lady Arabella been more\ntolerant of Dr Thorne. But the fact was, that they did die; and that\nthe mother's heart then got the better of the woman's pride, and Lady\nArabella humbled herself before Dr Thorne. She humbled herself, or\nwould have done so, had the doctor permitted her. But he, with his\neyes full of tears, stopped the utterance of her apology, took her\ntwo hands in his, pressed them warmly, and assured her that his joy\nin returning would be great, for the love that he bore to all that\nbelonged to Greshamsbury. And so the seven-and-sixpenny visits were\nrecommenced; and the great triumph of Dr Fillgrave came to an end.\n\nGreat was the joy in the Greshamsbury nursery when the second change\ntook place. Among the doctor's attributes, not hitherto mentioned,\nwas an aptitude for the society of children. He delighted to talk to\nchildren, and to play with them. He would carry them on his back,\nthree or four at a time, roll with them on the ground, race with\nthem in the garden, invent games for them, contrive amusements in\ncircumstances which seemed quite adverse to all manner of delight;\nand, above all, his physic was not nearly so nasty as that which came\nfrom Silverbridge.\n\nHe had a great theory as to the happiness of children; and though\nhe was not disposed altogether to throw over the precepts of\nSolomon--always bargaining that he should, under no circumstances,\nbe himself the executioner--he argued that the principal duty which\na parent owed to a child was to make him happy. Not only was the man\nto be made happy--the future man, if that might be possible--but the\nexisting boy was to be treated with equal favour; and his happiness,\nso said the doctor, was of much easier attainment.\n\n\"Why struggle after future advantage at the expense of present pain,\nseeing that the results were so very doubtful?\" Many an opponent of\nthe doctor had thought to catch him on the hip when so singular a\ndoctrine was broached; but they were not always successful. \"What!\"\nsaid his sensible enemies, \"is Johnny not to be taught to read\nbecause he does not like it?\" \"Johnny must read by all means,\" would\nthe doctor answer; \"but is it necessary that he should not like it?\nIf the preceptor have it in him, may not Johnny learn, not only to\nread, but to like to learn to read?\"\n\n\"But,\" would say his enemies, \"children must be controlled.\" \"And so\nmust men also,\" would say the doctor. \"I must not steal your peaches,\nnor make love to your wife, nor libel your character. Much as I\nmight wish through my natural depravity to indulge in such vices,\nI am debarred from them without pain, and I may almost say without\nunhappiness.\"\n\nAnd so the argument went on, neither party convincing the other. But,\nin the meantime, the children of the neighbourhood became very fond\nof Dr Thorne.\n\nDr Thorne and the squire were still fast friends, but circumstances\nhad occurred, spreading themselves now over a period of many years,\nwhich almost made the poor squire uneasy in the doctor's company. Mr\nGresham owed a large sum of money, and he had, moreover, already sold\na portion of his property. Unfortunately it had been the pride of the\nGreshams that their acres had descended from one to another without\nan entail, so that each possessor of Greshamsbury had had the full\npower to dispose of the property as he pleased. Any doubt as to\nits going to the male heir had never hitherto been felt. It had\noccasionally been encumbered by charges for younger children; but\nthese charges had been liquidated, and the property had come down\nwithout any burden to the present squire. Now a portion of this had\nbeen sold, and it had been sold to a certain degree through the\nagency of Dr Thorne.\n\nThis made the squire an unhappy man. No man loved his family name and\nhonour, his old family blazon and standing more thoroughly than he\ndid; he was every whit a Gresham at heart; but his spirit had been\nweaker than that of his forefathers; and, in his days, for the first\ntime, the Greshams were to go to the wall! Ten years before the\nbeginning of our story it had been necessary to raise a large sum of\nmoney to meet and pay off pressing liabilities, and it was found that\nthis could be done with more material advantage by selling a portion\nof the property than in any other way. A portion of it, about a third\nof the whole in value, was accordingly sold.\n\nBoxall Hill lay half-way between Greshamsbury and Barchester, and was\nknown as having the best partridge shooting in the county; as having\non it also a celebrated fox cover, Boxall Gorse, held in very high\nrepute by Barsetshire sportsmen. There was no residence on the\nimmediate estate, and it was altogether divided from the remainder of\nthe Greshamsbury property. This, with many inward and outward groans,\nMr Gresham permitted to be sold.\n\nIt was sold, and sold well, by private contract to a native of\nBarchester, who, having risen from the world's ranks, had made for\nhimself great wealth. Somewhat of this man's character must hereafter\nbe told; it will suffice to say that he relied for advice in money\nmatters upon Dr Thorne, and that at Dr Thorne's suggestion he had\npurchased Boxall Hill, partridge-shooting and gorse cover all\nincluded. He had not only bought Boxall Hill, but had subsequently\nlent the squire large sums of money on mortgage, in all which\ntransactions the doctor had taken part. It had therefore come to pass\nthat Mr Gresham was not unfrequently called upon to discuss his money\naffairs with Dr Thorne, and occasionally to submit to lectures and\nadvice which might perhaps as well have been omitted.\n\nSo much for Dr Thorne. A few words must still be said about Miss Mary\nbefore we rush into our story; the crust will then have been broken,\nand the pie will be open to the guests. Little Miss Mary was kept at\na farm-house till she was six; she was then sent to school at Bath,\nand transplanted to the doctor's newly furnished house a little more\nthan six years after that. It must not be supposed that he had lost\nsight of his charge during her earlier years. He was much too well\naware of the nature of the promise which he had made to the departing\nmother to do that. He had constantly visited his little niece, and\nlong before the first twelve years of her life were over had lost all\nconsciousness of his promise, and of his duty to the mother, in the\nstronger ties of downright personal love for the only creature that\nbelonged to him.\n\nWhen Mary came home the doctor was like a child in his glee. He\nprepared surprises for her with as much forethought and trouble as\nthough he were contriving mines to blow up an enemy. He took her\nfirst into the shop, and then into the kitchen, thence to the\ndining-rooms, after that to his and her bedrooms, and so on till\nhe came to the full glory of the new drawing-room, enhancing the\npleasure by little jokes, and telling her that he should never dare\nto come into the last paradise without her permission, and not then\ntill he had taken off his boots. Child as she was, she understood the\njoke, and carried it on like a little queen; and so they soon became\nthe firmest of friends.\n\nBut though Mary was a queen, it was still necessary that she should\nbe educated. Those were the earlier days in which Lady Arabella had\nhumbled herself, and to show her humility she invited Mary to share\nthe music-lessons of Augusta and Beatrice at the great house. A\nmusic-master from Barchester came over three times a week, and\nremained for three hours, and if the doctor chose to send his girl\nover, she could pick up what was going on without doing any harm.\nSo said the Lady Arabella. The doctor with many thanks and with no\nhesitation, accepted the offer, merely adding, that he had perhaps\nbetter settle separately with Signor Cantabili, the music-master. He\nwas very much obliged to Lady Arabella for giving his little girl\npermission to join her lessons to those of the Miss Greshams.\n\nIt need hardly be said that the Lady Arabella was on fire at once.\nSettle with Signor Cantabili! No, indeed; she would do that; there\nmust be no expense whatever incurred in such an arrangement on Miss\nThorne's account! But here, as in most things, the doctor carried his\npoint. It being the time of the lady's humility, she could not make\nas good a fight as she would otherwise have done; and thus she\nfound, to her great disgust, that Mary Thorne was learning music in\nher schoolroom on equal terms, as regarded payment, with her own\ndaughters. The arrangement having been made could not be broken,\nespecially as the young lady in nowise made herself disagreeable; and\nmore especially as the Miss Greshams themselves were very fond of\nher.\n\nAnd so Mary Thorne learnt music at Greshamsbury, and with her music\nshe learnt other things also; how to behave herself among girls of\nher own age; how to speak and talk as other young ladies do; how to\ndress herself, and how to move and walk. All which, she, being quick\nto learn, learnt without trouble at the great house. Something also\nshe learnt of French, seeing that the Greshamsbury French governess\nwas always in the room.\n\nAnd then, some few years later, there came a rector, and a rector's\nsister; and with the latter Mary studied German, and French also.\nFrom the doctor himself she learnt much; the choice, namely, of\nEnglish books for her own reading, and habits of thought somewhat\nakin to his own, though modified by the feminine softness of her\nindividual mind.\n\nAnd so Mary Thorne grew up and was educated. Of her personal\nappearance it certainly is my business as an author to say something.\nShe is my heroine, and, as such, must necessarily be very beautiful;\nbut, in truth, her mind and inner qualities are more clearly distinct\nto my brain than her outward form and features. I know that she was\nfar from being tall, and far from being showy; that her feet and\nhands were small and delicate; that her eyes were bright when looked\nat, but not brilliant so as to make their brilliancy palpably\nvisible to all around her; her hair was dark brown, and worn very\nplainly brushed from her forehead; her lips were thin, and her\nmouth, perhaps, in general inexpressive, but when she was eager in\nconversation it would show itself to be animated with curves of\nwondrous energy; and, quiet as she was in manner, sober and demure as\nwas her usual settled appearance, she could talk, when the fit came\non her, with an energy which in truth surprised those who did not\nknow her; aye, and sometimes those who did. Energy! nay, it was\noccasionally a concentration of passion, which left her for the\nmoment perfectly unconscious of all other cares but solicitude for\nthat subject which she might then be advocating.\n\nAll her friends, including the doctor, had at times been made unhappy\nby this vehemence of character; but yet it was to that very vehemence\nthat she owed it that all her friends so loved her. It had once\nnearly banished her in early years from the Greshamsbury schoolroom;\nand yet it ended in making her claim to remain there so strong, that\nLady Arabella could no longer oppose it, even when she had the wish\nto do so.\n\nA new French governess had lately come to Greshamsbury, and was, or\nwas to be, a great pet with Lady Arabella, having all the great gifts\nwith which a governess can be endowed, and being also a prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9e\nfrom the castle. The castle, in Greshamsbury parlance, always meant\nthat of Courcy. Soon after this a valued little locket belonging to\nAugusta Gresham was missing. The French governess had objected to its\nbeing worn in the schoolroom, and it had been sent up to the bedroom\nby a young servant-girl, the daughter of a small farmer on the\nestate. The locket was missing, and after a while, a considerable\nnoise in the matter having been made, was found, by the diligence of\nthe governess, somewhere among the belongings of the English servant.\nGreat was the anger of Lady Arabella, loud were the protestations\nof the girl, mute the woe of her father, piteous the tears of her\nmother, inexorable the judgment of the Greshamsbury world. But\nsomething occurred, it matters now not what, to separate Mary Thorne\nin opinion from that world at large. Out she then spoke, and to her\nface accused the governess of the robbery. For two days Mary was in\ndisgrace almost as deep as that of the farmer's daughter. But she was\nneither quiet nor dumb in her disgrace. When Lady Arabella would not\nhear her, she went to Mr Gresham. She forced her uncle to move in the\nmatter. She gained over to her side, one by one, the potentates of\nthe parish, and ended by bringing Mam'selle Larron down on her knees\nwith a confession of the facts. From that time Mary Thorne was dear\nto the tenantry of Greshamsbury; and specially dear at one small\nhousehold, where a rough-spoken father of a family was often heard to\ndeclare, that for Miss Mary Thorne he'd face man or magistrate, duke\nor devil.\n\nAnd so Mary Thorne grew up under the doctor's eye, and at the\nbeginning of our tale she was one of the guests assembled at\nGreshamsbury on the coming of age of the heir, she herself having\nthen arrived at the same period of her life.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nLessons from Courcy Castle\n\n\nIt was the first of July, young Frank Gresham's birthday, and the\nLondon season was not yet over; nevertheless, Lady de Courcy had\nmanaged to get down into the country to grace the coming of age\nof the heir, bringing with her all the Ladies Amelia, Rosina,\nMargaretta, and Alexandrina, together with such of the Honourable\nJohns and Georges as could be collected for the occasion.\n\nThe Lady Arabella had contrived this year to spend ten weeks in town,\nwhich, by a little stretching, she made to pass for the season; and\nhad managed, moreover, at last to refurnish, not ingloriously, the\nPortman Square drawing-room. She had gone up to London under the\npretext, imperatively urged, of Augusta's teeth--young ladies' teeth\nare not unfrequently of value in this way;--and having received\nauthority for a new carpet, which was really much wanted, had made\nsuch dexterous use of that sanction as to run up an upholsterer's\nbill of six or seven hundred pounds. She had of course had her\ncarriage and horses; the girls of course had gone out; it had been\npositively necessary to have a few friends in Portman Square;\nand, altogether, the ten weeks had not been unpleasant, and not\ninexpensive.\n\nFor a few confidential minutes before dinner, Lady de Courcy and her\nsister-in-law sat together in the latter's dressing-room, discussing\nthe unreasonableness of the squire, who had expressed himself with\nmore than ordinary bitterness as to the folly--he had probably used\nsome stronger word--of these London proceedings.\n\n\"Heavens!\" said the countess, with much eager animation; \"what can\nthe man expect? What does he wish you to do?\"\n\n\"He would like to sell the house in London, and bury us all here for\never. Mind, I was there only for ten weeks.\"\n\n\"Barely time for the girls to get their teeth properly looked at! But\nArabella, what does he say?\" Lady de Courcy was very anxious to learn\nthe exact truth of the matter, and ascertain, if she could, whether\nMr Gresham was really as poor as he pretended to be.\n\n\"Why, he said yesterday that he would have no more going to town at\nall; that he was barely able to pay the claims made on him, and keep\nup the house here, and that he would not--\"\n\n\"Would not what?\" asked the countess.\n\n\"Why, he said that he would not utterly ruin poor Frank.\"\n\n\"Ruin Frank!\"\n\n\"That's what he said.\"\n\n\"But, surely, Arabella, it is not so bad as that? What possible\nreason can there be for him to be in debt?\"\n\n\"He is always talking of those elections.\"\n\n\"But, my dear, Boxall Hill paid all that off. Of course Frank will\nnot have such an income as there was when you married into the\nfamily; we all know that. And whom will he have to thank but his\nfather? But Boxall Hill paid all those debts, and why should there be\nany difficulty now?\"\n\n\"It was those nasty dogs, Rosina,\" said the Lady Arabella, almost in\ntears.\n\n\"Well, I for one never approved of the hounds coming to Greshamsbury.\nWhen a man has once involved his property he should not incur any\nexpenses that are not absolutely necessary. That is a golden rule\nwhich Mr Gresham ought to have remembered. Indeed, I put it to him\nnearly in those very words; but Mr Gresham never did, and never will\nreceive with common civility anything that comes from me.\"\n\n\"I know, Rosina, he never did; and yet where would he have been\nbut for the de Courcys?\" So exclaimed, in her gratitude, the Lady\nArabella; to speak the truth, however, but for the de Courcys, Mr\nGresham might have been at this moment on the top of Boxall Hill,\nmonarch of all he surveyed.\n\n\"As I was saying,\" continued the countess, \"I never approved of the\nhounds coming to Greshamsbury; but yet, my dear, the hounds can't\nhave eaten up everything. A man with ten thousand a year ought to be\nable to keep hounds; particularly as he had a subscription.\"\n\n\"He says the subscription was little or nothing.\"\n\n\"That's nonsense, my dear. Now, Arabella, what does he do with his\nmoney? That's the question. Does he gamble?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Lady Arabella, very slowly, \"I don't think he does.\" If\nthe squire did gamble he must have done it very slyly, for he rarely\nwent away from Greshamsbury, and certainly very few men looking like\ngamblers were in the habit of coming thither as guests. \"I don't\nthink he does gamble.\" Lady Arabella put her emphasis on the word\ngamble, as though her husband, if he might perhaps be charitably\nacquitted of that vice, was certainly guilty of every other known in\nthe civilised world.\n\n\"I know he used,\" said Lady de Courcy, looking very wise, and rather\nsuspicious. She certainly had sufficient domestic reasons for\ndisliking the propensity; \"I know he used; and when a man begins, he\nis hardly ever cured.\"\n\n\"Well, if he does, I don't know it,\" said the Lady Arabella.\n\n\"The money, my dear, must go somewhere. What excuse does he give when\nyou tell him you want this and that--all the common necessaries of\nlife, that you have always been used to?\"\n\n\"He gives no excuse; sometimes he says the family is so large.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! Girls cost nothing; there's only Frank, and he can't have\ncost anything yet. Can he be saving money to buy back Boxall Hill?\"\n\n\"Oh no!\" said the Lady Arabella, quickly. \"He is not saving anything;\nhe never did, and never will save, though he is so stingy to me. He\n_is_ hard pushed for money, I know that.\"\n\n\"Then where has it gone?\" said the Countess de Courcy, with a look of\nstern decision.\n\n\"Heaven only knows! Now, Augusta is to be married. I must of course\nhave a few hundred pounds. You should have heard how he groaned when\nI asked him for it. Heaven only knows where the money goes!\" And the\ninjured wife wiped a piteous tear from her eye with her fine dress\ncambric handkerchief. \"I have all the sufferings and privations of\na poor man's wife, but I have none of the consolations. He has no\nconfidence in me; he never tells me anything; he never talks to\nme about his affairs. If he talks to any one it is to that horrid\ndoctor.\"\n\n\"What, Dr Thorne?\" Now the Countess de Courcy hated Dr Thorne with a\nholy hatred.\n\n\"Yes; Dr Thorne. I believe that he knows everything; and advises\neverything, too. Whatever difficulties poor Gresham may have, I do\nbelieve Dr Thorne has brought them about. I do believe it, Rosina.\"\n\n\"Well, that is surprising. Mr Gresham, with all his faults, is\na gentleman; and how he can talk about his affairs with a low\napothecary like that, I, for one, cannot imagine. Lord de Courcy has\nnot always been to me all that he should have been; far from it.\" And\nLady de Courcy thought over in her mind injuries of a much graver\ndescription than any that her sister-in-law had ever suffered; \"but I\nhave never known anything like that at Courcy Castle. Surely Umbleby\nknows all about it, doesn't he?\"\n\n\"Not half so much as the doctor,\" said Lady Arabella.\n\nThe countess shook her head slowly; the idea of Mr Gresham, a country\ngentleman of good estate like him, making a confidant of a country\ndoctor was too great a shock for her nerves; and for a while she was\nconstrained to sit silent before she could recover herself.\n\n\"One thing at any rate is certain, Arabella,\" said the countess,\nas soon as she found herself again sufficiently composed to offer\ncounsel in a properly dictatorial manner. \"One thing at any rate is\ncertain; if Mr Gresham be involved so deeply as you say, Frank has\nbut one duty before him. He must marry money. The heir of fourteen\nthousand a year may indulge himself in looking for blood, as Mr\nGresham did, my dear\"--it must be understood that there was very\nlittle compliment in this, as the Lady Arabella had always conceived\nherself to be a beauty--\"or for beauty, as some men do,\" continued\nthe countess, thinking of the choice that the present Earl de Courcy\nhad made; \"but Frank must marry money. I hope he will understand this\nearly; do make him understand this before he makes a fool of himself;\nwhen a man thoroughly understands this, when he knows what his\ncircumstances require, why, the matter becomes easy to him. I hope\nthat Frank understands that he has no alternative. In his position he\nmust marry money.\"\n\nBut, alas! alas! Frank Gresham had already made a fool of himself.\n\n\"Well, my boy, I wish you joy with all my heart,\" said the Honourable\nJohn, slapping his cousin on the back, as he walked round to the\nstable-yard with him before dinner, to inspect a setter puppy of\npeculiarly fine breed which had been sent to Frank as a birthday\npresent. \"I wish I were an elder son; but we can't all have that\nluck.\"\n\n\"Who wouldn't sooner be the younger son of an earl than the eldest\nson of a plain squire?\" said Frank, wishing to say something civil in\nreturn for his cousin's civility.\n\n\"I wouldn't for one,\" said the Honourable John. \"What chance have I?\nThere's Porlock as strong as a horse; and then George comes next. And\nthe governor's good for these twenty years.\" And the young man sighed\nas he reflected what small hope there was that all those who were\nnearest and dearest to him should die out of his way, and leave him\nto the sweet enjoyment of an earl's coronet and fortune. \"Now, you're\nsure of your game some day; and as you've no brothers, I suppose the\nsquire'll let you do pretty well what you like. Besides, he's not so\nstrong as my governor, though he's younger.\"\n\nFrank had never looked at his fortune in this light before, and was\nso slow and green that he was not much delighted at the prospect now\nthat it was offered to him. He had always, however, been taught to\nlook to his cousins, the de Courcys, as men with whom it would be\nvery expedient that he should be intimate; he therefore showed no\noffence, but changed the conversation.\n\n\"Shall you hunt with the Barsetshire this season, John? I hope you\nwill; I shall.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know. It's very slow. It's all tillage here, or else\nwoodland. I rather fancy I shall go to Leicestershire when the\npartridge-shooting is over. What sort of a lot do you mean to come\nout with, Frank?\"\n\nFrank became a little red as he answered, \"Oh, I shall have two,\" he\nsaid; \"that is, the mare I have had these two years, and the horse my\nfather gave me this morning.\"\n\n\"What! only those two? and the mare is nothing more than a pony.\"\n\n\"She is fifteen hands,\" said Frank, offended.\n\n\"Well, Frank, I certainly would not stand that,\" said the Honourable\nJohn. \"What, go out before the county with one untrained horse and a\npony; and you the heir to Greshamsbury!\"\n\n\"I'll have him so trained before November,\" said Frank, \"that\nnothing in Barsetshire shall stop him. Peter says\"--Peter was\nthe Greshamsbury stud-groom--\"that he tucks up his hind legs\nbeautifully.\"\n\n\"But who the deuce would think of going to work with one horse; or\ntwo either, if you insist on calling the old pony a huntress? I'll\nput you up to a trick, my lad: if you stand that you'll stand\nanything; and if you don't mean to go in leading-strings all your\nlife, now is the time to show it. There's young Baker--Harry Baker,\nyou know--he came of age last year, and he has as pretty a string of\nnags as any one would wish to set eyes on; four hunters and a hack.\nNow, if old Baker has four thousand a year it's every shilling he has\ngot.\"\n\nThis was true, and Frank Gresham, who in the morning had been made so\nhappy by his father's present of a horse, began to feel that hardly\nenough had been done for him. It was true that Mr Baker had only four\nthousand a year; but it was also true that he had no other child than\nHarry Baker; that he had no great establishment to keep up; that he\nowed a shilling to no one; and, also, that he was a great fool in\nencouraging a mere boy to ape all the caprices of a man of wealth.\nNevertheless, for a moment, Frank Gresham did feel that, considering\nhis position, he was being treated rather unworthily.\n\n\"Take the matter in your own hands, Frank,\" said the Honourable John,\nseeing the impression that he had made. \"Of course the governor knows\nvery well that you won't put up with such a stable as that. Lord\nbless you! I have heard that when he married my aunt, and that was\nwhen he was about your age, he had the best stud in the whole county;\nand then he was in Parliament before he was three-and-twenty.\"\n\n\"His father, you know, died when he was very young,\" said Frank.\n\n\"Yes; I know he had a stroke of luck that doesn't fall to everyone;\nbut--\"\n\nYoung Frank's face grew dark now instead of red. When his cousin\nsubmitted to him the necessity of having more than two horses for\nhis own use he could listen to him; but when the same monitor talked\nof the chance of a father's death as a stroke of luck, Frank was\ntoo much disgusted to be able to pretend to pass it over with\nindifference. What! was he thus to think of his father, whose face\nwas always lighted up with pleasure when his boy came near to him,\nand so rarely bright at any other time? Frank had watched his father\nclosely enough to be aware of this; he knew how his father delighted\nin him; he had had cause to guess that his father had many troubles,\nand that he strove hard to banish the memory of them when his son was\nwith him. He loved his father truly, purely, and thoroughly, liked to\nbe with him, and would be proud to be his confidant. Could he then\nlisten quietly while his cousin spoke of the chance of his father's\ndeath as a stroke of luck?\n\n\"I shouldn't think it a stroke of luck, John. I should think it the\ngreatest misfortune in the world.\"\n\nIt is so difficult for a young man to enumerate sententiously a\nprinciple of morality, or even an expression of ordinary good\nfeeling, without giving himself something of a ridiculous air,\nwithout assuming something of a mock grandeur!\n\n\"Oh, of course, my dear fellow,\" said the Honourable John, laughing;\n\"that's a matter of course. We all understand that without saying it.\nPorlock, of course, would feel exactly the same about the governor;\nbut if the governor were to walk, I think Porlock would console\nhimself with the thirty thousand a year.\"\n\n\"I don't know what Porlock would do; he's always quarrelling with my\nuncle, I know. I only spoke of myself; I never quarrelled with my\nfather, and I hope I never shall.\"\n\n\"All right, my lad of wax, all right. I dare say you won't be tried;\nbut if you are, you'll find before six months are over, that it's a\nvery nice thing to master of Greshamsbury.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I shouldn't find anything of the kind.\"\n\n\"Very well, so be it. You wouldn't do as young Hatherly did, at\nHatherly Court, in Gloucestershire, when his father kicked the\nbucket. You know Hatherly, don't you?\"\n\n\"No; I never saw him.\"\n\n\"He's Sir Frederick now, and has, or had, one of the finest fortunes\nin England, for a commoner; the most of it is gone now. Well, when he\nheard of his governor's death, he was in Paris, but he went off to\nHatherly as fast as special train and post-horses would carry him,\nand got there just in time for the funeral. As he came back to\nHatherly Court from the church, they were putting up the hatchment\nover the door, and Master Fred saw that the undertakers had put at\nthe bottom 'Resurgam.' You know what that means?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Frank.\n\n\"'I'll come back again,'\" said the Honourable John, construing the\nLatin for the benefit of his cousin. \"'No,' said Fred Hatherly,\nlooking up at the hatchment; 'I'm blessed if you do, old gentleman.\nThat would be too much of a joke; I'll take care of that.' So he\ngot up at night, and he got some fellows with him, and they climbed\nup and painted out 'Resurgam,' and they painted into its place,\n'Requiescat in pace;' which means, you know, 'you'd a great deal\nbetter stay where you are.' Now I call that good. Fred Hatherly did\nthat as sure as--as sure as--as sure as anything.\"\n\nFrank could not help laughing at the story, especially at his\ncousin's mode of translating the undertaker's mottoes; and then they\nsauntered back from the stables into the house to dress for dinner.\n\nDr Thorne had come to the house somewhat before dinner-time, at Mr\nGresham's request, and was now sitting with the squire in his own\nbook-room--so called--while Mary was talking to some of the girls\nupstairs.\n\n\"I must have ten or twelve thousand pounds; ten at the very least,\"\nsaid the squire, who was sitting in his usual arm-chair, close to his\nlittered table, with his head supported on his hand, looking very\nunlike the father of an heir of a noble property, who had that day\ncome of age.\n\nIt was the first of July, and of course there was no fire in the\ngrate; but, nevertheless, the doctor was standing with his back to\nthe fireplace, with his coat-tails over his arms, as though he were\nengaged, now in summer as he so often was in winter, in talking, and\nroasting his hinder person at the same time.\n\n\"Twelve thousand pounds! It's a very large sum of money.\"\n\n\"I said ten,\" said the squire.\n\n\"Ten thousand pounds is a very large sum of money. There is no doubt\nhe'll let you have it. Scatcherd will let you have it; but I know\nhe'll expect to have the title deeds.\"\n\n\"What! for ten thousand pounds?\" said the squire. \"There is not a\nregistered debt against the property but his own and Armstrong's.\"\n\n\"But his own is very large already.\"\n\n\"Armstrong's is nothing; about four-and-twenty thousand pounds.\"\n\n\"Yes; but he comes first, Mr Gresham.\"\n\n\"Well, what of that? To hear you talk, one would think that there was\nnothing left of Greshamsbury. What's four-and-twenty thousand pounds?\nDoes Scatcherd know what rent-roll is?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, he knows it well enough: I wish he did not.\"\n\n\"Well, then, why does he make such a bother about a few thousand\npounds? The title-deeds, indeed!\"\n\n\"What he means is, that he must have ample security to cover what he\nhas already advanced before he goes on. I wish to goodness you had\nno further need to borrow. I did think that things were settled last\nyear.\"\n\n\"Oh if there's any difficulty, Umbleby will get it for me.\"\n\n\"Yes; and what will you have to pay for it?\"\n\n\"I'd sooner pay double than be talked to in this way,\" said the\nsquire, angrily, and, as he spoke, he got up hurriedly from his\nchair, thrust his hands into his trousers-pockets, walked quickly to\nthe window, and immediately walking back again, threw himself once\nmore into his chair.\n\n\"There are some things a man cannot bear, doctor,\" said he, beating\nthe devil's tattoo on the floor with one of his feet, \"though God\nknows I ought to be patient now, for I am made to bear a good many\nthings. You had better tell Scatcherd that I am obliged to him for\nhis offer, but that I will not trouble him.\"\n\nThe doctor during this little outburst had stood quite silent with\nhis back to the fireplace and his coat-tails hanging over his arms;\nbut though his voice said nothing, his face said much. He was very\nunhappy; he was greatly grieved to find that the squire was so soon\nagain in want of money, and greatly grieved also to find that this\nwant had made him so bitter and unjust. Mr Gresham had attacked him;\nbut as he was determined not to quarrel with Mr Gresham, he refrained\nfrom answering.\n\nThe squire also remained silent for a few minutes; but he was not\nendowed with the gift of silence, and was soon, as it were, compelled\nto speak again.\n\n\"Poor Frank!\" said he. \"I could yet be easy about everything if it\nwere not for the injury I have done him. Poor Frank!\"\n\nThe doctor advanced a few paces from off the rug, and taking his hand\nout of his pocket, he laid it gently on the squire's shoulder. \"Frank\nwill do very well yet,\" said the he. \"It is not absolutely necessary\nthat a man should have fourteen thousand pounds a year to be happy.\"\n\n\"My father left me the property entire, and I should leave it entire\nto my son;--but you don't understand this.\"\n\nThe doctor did understand the feeling fully. The fact, on the other\nhand, was that, long as he had known him, the squire did not\nunderstand the doctor.\n\n\"I would you could, Mr Gresham,\" said the doctor, \"so that your mind\nmight be happier; but that cannot be, and, therefore, I say again,\nthat Frank will do very well yet, although he will not inherit\nfourteen thousand pounds a year; and I would have you say the same\nthing to yourself.\"\n\n\"Ah! you don't understand it,\" persisted the squire. \"You don't know\nhow a man feels when he--Ah, well! it's no use my troubling you with\nwhat cannot be mended. I wonder whether Umbleby is about the place\nanywhere?\"\n\nThe doctor was again standing with his back against the\nchimney-piece, and with his hands in his pockets.\n\n\"You did not see Umbleby as you came in?\" again asked the squire.\n\n\"No, I did not; and if you will take my advice you will not see him\nnow; at any rate with reference to this money.\"\n\n\"I tell you I must get it from someone; you say Scatcherd won't let\nme have it.\"\n\n\"No, Mr Gresham; I did not say that.\"\n\n\"Well, you said what was as bad. Augusta is to be married in\nSeptember, and the money must be had. I have agreed to give Moffat\nsix thousand pounds, and he is to have the money down in hard cash.\"\n\n\"Six thousand pounds,\" said the doctor. \"Well, I suppose that is not\nmore than your daughter should have. But then, five times six are\nthirty; thirty thousand pounds will be a large sum to make up.\"\n\nThe father thought to himself that his younger girls were but\nchildren, and that the trouble of arranging their marriage portions\nmight well be postponed a while. Sufficient for the day is the evil\nthereof.\n\n\"That Moffat is a griping, hungry fellow,\" said the squire. \"I\nsuppose Augusta likes him; and, as regards money, it is a good\nmatch.\"\n\n\"If Miss Gresham loves him, that is everything. I am not in love with\nhim myself; but then, I am not a young lady.\"\n\n\"The de Courcys are very fond of him. Lady de Courcy says that he is\na perfect gentleman, and thought very much of in London.\"\n\n\"Oh! if Lady de Courcy says that, of course, it's all right,\" said\nthe doctor, with a quiet sarcasm, that was altogether thrown away on\nthe squire.\n\nThe squire did not like any of the de Courcys; especially, he did not\nlike Lady de Courcy; but still he was accessible to a certain amount\nof gratification in the near connexion which he had with the earl and\ncountess; and when he wanted to support his family greatness, would\nsometimes weakly fall back upon the grandeur of Courcy Castle. It\nwas only when talking to his wife that he invariably snubbed the\npretensions of his noble relatives.\n\nThe two men after this remained silent for a while; and then the\ndoctor, renewing the subject for which he had been summoned into the\nbook-room, remarked, that as Scatcherd was now in the country--he\ndid not say, was now at Boxall Hill, as he did not wish to wound the\nsquire's ears--perhaps he had better go and see him, and ascertain\nin what way this affair of the money might be arranged. There was\nno doubt, he said, that Scatcherd would supply the sum required at\na lower rate of interest than that at which it could be procured\nthrough Umbleby's means.\n\n\"Very well,\" said the squire. \"I'll leave it in your hands, then. I\nthink ten thousand pounds will do. And now I'll dress for dinner.\"\nAnd then the doctor left him.\n\nPerhaps the reader will suppose after this that the doctor had some\npecuniary interest of his own in arranging the squire's loans; or, at\nany rate, he will think that the squire must have so thought. Not in\nthe least; neither had he any such interest, nor did the squire think\nthat he had any. What Dr Thorne did in this matter the squire well\nknew was done for love. But the squire of Greshamsbury was a great\nman at Greshamsbury; and it behoved him to maintain the greatness of\nhis squirehood when discussing his affairs with the village doctor.\nSo much he had at any rate learnt from his contact with the de\nCourcys.\n\nAnd the doctor--proud, arrogant, contradictory, headstrong as he\nwas--why did he bear to be thus snubbed? Because he knew that the\nsquire of Greshamsbury, when struggling with debt and poverty,\nrequired an indulgence for his weakness. Had Mr Gresham been in easy\ncircumstances, the doctor would by no means have stood so placidly\nwith his hands in his pockets, and have had Mr Umbleby thus thrown in\nhis teeth. The doctor loved the squire, loved him as his own oldest\nfriend; but he loved him ten times better as being in adversity than\nhe could ever have done had things gone well at Greshamsbury in his\ntime.\n\nWhile this was going on downstairs, Mary was sitting upstairs with\nBeatrice Gresham in the schoolroom. The old schoolroom, so called,\nwas now a sitting-room, devoted to the use of the grown-up young\nladies of the family, whereas one of the old nurseries was now the\nmodern schoolroom. Mary well knew her way to the sanctum, and,\nwithout asking any questions, walked up to it when her uncle went to\nthe squire. On entering the room she found that Augusta and the Lady\nAlexandrina were also there, and she hesitated for a moment at the\ndoor.\n\n\"Come in, Mary,\" said Beatrice, \"you know my cousin Alexandrina.\"\nMary came in, and having shaken hands with her two friends, was\nbowing to the lady, when the lady condescended, put out her noble\nhand, and touched Miss Thorne's fingers.\n\nBeatrice was Mary's friend, and many heart-burnings and much mental\nsolicitude did that young lady give to her mother by indulging in\nsuch a friendship. But Beatrice, with some faults, was true at heart,\nand she persisted in loving Mary Thorne in spite of the hints which\nher mother so frequently gave as to the impropriety of such an\naffection.\n\nNor had Augusta any objection to the society of Miss Thorne. Augusta\nwas a strong-minded girl, with much of the de Courcy arrogance, but\nquite as well inclined to show it in opposition to her mother as in\nany other form. To her alone in the house did Lady Arabella show much\ndeference. She was now going to make a suitable match with a man of\nlarge fortune, who had been procured for her as an eligible _parti_\nby her aunt, the countess. She did not pretend, had never pretended,\nthat she loved Mr Moffat, but she knew, she said, that in the present\nstate of her father's affairs such a match was expedient. Mr Moffat\nwas a young man of very large fortune, in Parliament, inclined to\nbusiness, and in every way recommendable. He was not a man of birth,\nto be sure; that was to be lamented;--in confessing that Mr Moffat\nwas not a man of birth, Augusta did not go so far as to admit that he\nwas the son of a tailor; such, however, was the rigid truth in this\nmatter--he was not a man of birth, that was to be lamented; but in\nthe present state of affairs at Greshamsbury, she understood well\nthat it was her duty to postpone her own feelings in some respect. Mr\nMoffat would bring fortune; she would bring blood and connexion. And\nas she so said, her bosom glowed with strong pride to think that she\nwould be able to contribute so much more towards the proposed future\npartnership than her husband would do.\n\n'Twas thus that Miss Gresham spoke of her match to her dear friends,\nher cousins the de Courcys for instance, to Miss Oriel, her sister\nBeatrice, and even to Mary Thorne. She had no enthusiasm, she\nadmitted, but she thought she had good judgment. She thought she\nhad shown good judgment in accepting Mr Moffat's offer, though she\ndid not pretend to any romance of affection. And, having so said,\nshe went to work with considerable mental satisfaction, choosing\nfurniture, carriages, and clothes, not extravagantly as her mother\nwould have done, not in deference to sterner dictates of the latest\nfashion as her aunt would have done, with none of the girlish glee\nin new purchases which Beatrice would have felt, but with sound\njudgment. She bought things that were rich, for her husband was to be\nrich, and she meant to avail herself of his wealth; she bought things\nthat were fashionable, for she meant to live in the fashionable\nworld; but she bought what was good, and strong, and lasting, and\nworth its money.\n\nAugusta Gresham had perceived early in life that she could not obtain\nsuccess either as an heiress, or as a beauty, nor could she shine\nas a wit; she therefore fell back on such qualities as she had, and\ndetermined to win the world as a strong-minded, useful woman. That\nwhich she had of her own was blood; having that, she would in all\nways do what in her lay to enhance its value. Had she not possessed\nit, it would to her mind have been the vainest of pretences.\n\nWhen Mary came in, the wedding preparations were being discussed. The\nnumber and names of the bridesmaids were being settled, the dresses\nwere on the tapis, the invitations to be given were talked over.\nSensible as Augusta was, she was not above such feminine cares; she\nwas, indeed, rather anxious that the wedding should go off well. She\nwas a little ashamed of her tailor's son, and therefore anxious that\nthings should be as brilliant as possible.\n\nThe bridesmaid's names had just been written on a card as Mary\nentered the room. There were the Ladies Amelia, Rosina, Margaretta,\nand Alexandrina of course at the head of it; then came Beatrice and\nthe twins; then Miss Oriel, who, though only a parson's sister, was\na person of note, birth, and fortune. After this there had been here\na great discussion whether or not there should be any more. If there\nwere to be one more there must be two. Now Miss Moffat had expressed\na direct wish, and Augusta, though she would much rather have done\nwithout her, hardly knew how to refuse. Alexandrina--we hope we\nmay be allowed to drop the \"lady\" for the sake of brevity, for the\npresent scene only--was dead against such an unreasonable request.\n\"We none of us know her, you know; and it would not be comfortable.\"\nBeatrice strongly advocated the future sister-in-law's acceptance\ninto the bevy; she had her own reasons; she was pained that Mary\nThorne should not be among the number, and if Miss Moffat were\naccepted, perhaps Mary might be brought in as her colleague.\n\n\"If you have Miss Moffat,\" said Alexandrina, \"you must have dear\nPussy too; and I really think that Pussy is too young; it will be\ntroublesome.\" Pussy was the youngest Miss Gresham, who was now only\neight years old, and whose real name was Nina.\n\n\"Augusta,\" said Beatrice, speaking with some slight hesitation, some\nsoup\u00c3\u00a7on of doubt, before the high authority of her noble cousin, \"if\nyou do have Miss Moffat would you mind asking Mary Thorne to join\nher? I think Mary would like it, because, you see, Patience Oriel\nis to be one; and we have known Mary much longer than we have known\nPatience.\"\n\nThen out and spake the Lady Alexandrina.\n\n\"Beatrice, dear, if you think of what you are asking, I am sure you\nwill see that it would not do; would not do at all. Miss Thorne is a\nvery nice girl, I am sure; and, indeed, what little I have seen of\nher I highly approve. But, after all, who is she? Mamma, I know,\nthinks that Aunt Arabella has been wrong to let her be here so much,\nbut--\"\n\nBeatrice became rather red in the face, and, in spite of the dignity\nof her cousin, was preparing to defend her friend.\n\n\"Mind, I am not saying a word against Miss Thorne.\"\n\n\"If I am married before her, she shall be one of my bridesmaids,\"\nsaid Beatrice.\n\n\"That will probably depend on circumstances,\" said the Lady\nAlexandrina; I find that I cannot bring my courteous pen to drop the\ntitle. \"But Augusta is very peculiarly situated. Mr Moffat is, you\nsee, not of the very highest birth; and, therefore, she should take\ncare that on her side every one about her is well born.\"\n\n\"Then you cannot have Miss Moffat,\" said Beatrice.\n\n\"No; I would not if I could help it,\" said the cousin.\n\n\"But the Thornes are as good a family as the Greshams,\" said\nBeatrice. She had not quite the courage to say, as good as the de\nCourcys.\n\n\"I dare say they are; and if this was Miss Thorne of Ullathorne,\nAugusta probably would not object to her. But can you tell me who\nMiss Mary Thorne is?\"\n\n\"She is Dr Thorne's niece.\"\n\n\"You mean that she is called so; but do you know who her father\nwas, or who her mother was? I, for one, must own I do not. Mamma, I\nbelieve, does, but--\"\n\nAt this moment the door opened gently and Mary Thorne entered the\nroom.\n\nIt may easily be conceived, that while Mary was making her\nsalutations the three other young ladies were a little cast aback.\nThe Lady Alexandrina, however, quickly recovered herself, and, by her\ninimitable presence of mind and facile grace of manner, soon put the\nmatter on a proper footing.\n\n\"We were discussing Miss Gresham's marriage,\" said she; \"I am sure I\nmay mention to an acquaintance of so long standing as Miss Thorne,\nthat the first of September has been now fixed for the wedding.\"\n\nMiss Gresham! Acquaintance of so long standing! Why, Mary and Augusta\nGresham had for years, we will hardly say now for how many, passed\ntheir mornings together in the same schoolroom; had quarrelled, and\nsquabbled, and caressed and kissed, and been all but as sisters to\neach other. Acquaintance indeed! Beatrice felt that her ears were\ntingling, and even Augusta was a little ashamed. Mary, however,\nknew that the cold words had come from a de Courcy, and not from a\nGresham, and did not, therefore, resent them.\n\n\"So it's settled, Augusta, is it?\" said she; \"the first of September.\nI wish you joy with all my heart,\" and, coming round, she put her arm\nover Augusta's shoulder and kissed her. The Lady Alexandrina could\nnot but think that the doctor's niece uttered her congratulations\nvery much as though she were speaking to an equal; very much as\nthough she had a father and mother of her own.\n\n\"You will have delicious weather,\" continued Mary. \"September, and\nthe beginning of October, is the nicest time of the year. If I were\ngoing honeymooning it is just the time of year I would choose.\"\n\n\"I wish you were, Mary,\" said Beatrice.\n\n\"So do not I, dear, till I have found some decent sort of a body to\nhoneymoon along with me. I won't stir out of Greshamsbury till I have\nsent you off before me, at any rate. And where will you go, Augusta?\"\n\n\"We have not settled that,\" said Augusta. \"Mr Moffat talks of Paris.\"\n\n\"Who ever heard of going to Paris in September?\" said the Lady\nAlexandrina.\n\n\"Or who ever heard of the gentleman having anything to say on the\nmatter?\" said the doctor's niece. \"Of course Mr Moffat will go\nwherever you are pleased to take him.\"\n\nThe Lady Alexandrina was not pleased to find how completely the\ndoctor's niece took upon herself to talk, and sit, and act at\nGreshamsbury as though she was on a par with the young ladies of\nthe family. That Beatrice should have allowed this would not have\nsurprised her; but it was to be expected that Augusta would have\nshown better judgment.\n\n\"These things require some tact in their management; some delicacy\nwhen high interests are at stake,\" said she; \"I agree with Miss\nThorne in thinking that, in ordinary circumstances, with ordinary\npeople, perhaps, the lady should have her way. Rank, however, has its\ndrawbacks, Miss Thorne, as well as its privileges.\"\n\n\"I should not object to the drawbacks,\" said the doctor's niece,\n\"presuming them to be of some use; but I fear I might fail in getting\non so well with the privileges.\"\n\nThe Lady Alexandrina looked at her as though not fully aware whether\nshe intended to be pert. In truth, the Lady Alexandrina was rather in\nthe dark on the subject. It was almost impossible, it was incredible,\nthat a fatherless, motherless, doctor's niece should be pert to an\nearl's daughter at Greshamsbury, seeing that that earl's daughter was\nthe cousin of the Miss Greshams. And yet the Lady Alexandrina hardly\nknew what other construction to put on the words she had just heard.\n\nIt was at any rate clear to her that it was not becoming that she\nshould just then stay any longer in that room. Whether she intended\nto be pert or not, Miss Mary Thorne was, to say the least, very free.\nThe de Courcy ladies knew what was due to them--no ladies better;\nand, therefore, the Lady Alexandrina made up her mind at once to go\nto her own bedroom.\n\n\"Augusta,\" she said, rising slowly from her chair with much stately\ncomposure, \"it is nearly time to dress; will you come with me? We\nhave a great deal to settle, you know.\"\n\nSo she swam out of the room, and Augusta, telling Mary that she would\nsee her again at dinner, swam--no, tried to swim--after her. Miss\nGresham had had great advantages; but she had not been absolutely\nbrought up at Courcy Castle, and could not as yet quite assume the\nCourcy style of swimming.\n\n\"There,\" said Mary, as the door closed behind the rustling muslins\nof the ladies. \"There, I have made an enemy for ever, perhaps two;\nthat's satisfactory.\"\n\n\"And why have you done it, Mary? When I am fighting your battles\nbehind your back, why do you come and upset it all by making the\nwhole family of the de Courcys dislike you? In such a matter as that,\nthey'll all go together.\"\n\n\"I am sure they will,\" said Mary; \"whether they would be equally\nunanimous in a case of love and charity, that, indeed, is another\nquestion.\"\n\n\"But why should you try to make my cousin angry; you that ought to\nhave so much sense? Don't you remember what you were saying yourself\nthe other day, of the absurdity of combatting pretences which the\nworld sanctions?\"\n\n\"I do, Trichy, I do; don't scold me now. It is so much easier to\npreach than to practise. I do so wish I was a clergyman.\"\n\n\"But you have done so much harm, Mary.\"\n\n\"Have I?\" said Mary, kneeling down on the ground at her friend's\nfeet. \"If I humble myself very low; if I kneel through the whole\nevening in a corner; if I put my neck down and let all your cousins\ntrample on it, and then your aunt, would not that make atonement? I\nwould not object to wearing sackcloth, either; and I'd eat a little\nashes--or, at any rate, I'd try.\"\n\n\"I know you're clever, Mary; but still I think you're a fool. I do,\nindeed.\"\n\n\"I am a fool, Trichy, I do confess it; and am not a bit clever; but\ndon't scold me; you see how humble I am; not only humble but umble,\nwhich I look upon to be the comparative, or, indeed, superlative\ndegree. Or perhaps there are four degrees; humble, umble, stumble,\ntumble; and then, when one is absolutely in the dirt at their feet,\nperhaps these big people won't wish one to stoop any further.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mary!\"\n\n\"And, oh, Trichy! you don't mean to say I mayn't speak out before\nyou. There, perhaps you'd like to put your foot on my neck.\" And then\nshe put her head down to the footstool and kissed Beatrice's feet.\n\n\"I'd like, if I dared, to put my hand on your cheek and give you a\ngood slap for being such a goose.\"\n\n\"Do; do, Trichy: you shall tread on me, or slap me, or kiss me;\nwhichever you like.\"\n\n\"I can't tell you how vexed I am,\" said Beatrice; \"I wanted to\narrange something.\"\n\n\"Arrange something! What? arrange what? I love arranging. I fancy\nmyself qualified to be an arranger-general in female matters. I\nmean pots and pans, and such like. Of course I don't allude to\nextraordinary people and extraordinary circumstances that require\ntact, and delicacy, and drawbacks, and that sort of thing.\"\n\n\"Very well, Mary.\"\n\n\"But it's not very well; it's very bad if you look like that. Well,\nmy pet, there I won't. I won't allude to the noble blood of your\nnoble relatives either in joke or in earnest. What is it you want to\narrange, Trichy?\"\n\n\"I want you to be one of Augusta's bridesmaids.\"\n\n\"Good heavens, Beatrice! Are you mad? What! Put me, even for a\nmorning, into the same category of finery as the noble blood from\nCourcy Castle!\"\n\n\"Patience is to be one.\"\n\n\"But that is no reason why Impatience should be another, and I should\nbe very impatient under such honours. No, Trichy; joking apart, do\nnot think of it. Even if Augusta wished it I should refuse. I should\nbe obliged to refuse. I, too, suffer from pride; a pride quite as\nunpardonable as that of others: I could not stand with your four\nlady-cousins behind your sister at the altar. In such a galaxy they\nwould be the stars and I--\"\n\n\"Why, Mary, all the world knows that you are prettier than any of\nthem!\"\n\n\"I am all the world's very humble servant. But, Trichy, I should\nnot object if I were as ugly as the veiled prophet and they all as\nbeautiful as Zuleika. The glory of that galaxy will be held to depend\nnot on its beauty, but on its birth. You know how they would look at\nme; how they would scorn me; and there, in church, at the altar, with\nall that is solemn round us, I could not return their scorn as I\nmight do elsewhere. In a room I'm not a bit afraid of them all.\" And\nMary was again allowing herself to be absorbed by that feeling of\nindomitable pride, of antagonism to the pride of others, which she\nherself in her cooler moments was the first to blame.\n\n\"You often say, Mary, that that sort of arrogance should be despised\nand passed over without notice.\"\n\n\"So it should, Trichy. I tell you that as a clergyman tells you to\nhate riches. But though the clergyman tells you so, he is not the\nless anxious to be rich himself.\"\n\n\"I particularly wish you to be one of Augusta's bridesmaids.\"\n\n\"And I particularly wish to decline the honour; which honour has\nnot been, and will not be, offered to me. No, Trichy. I will not be\nAugusta's bridesmaid, but--but--but--\"\n\n\"But what, dearest?\"\n\n\"But, Trichy, when some one else is married, when the new wing has\nbeen built to a house that you know of--\"\n\n\"Now, Mary, hold your tongue, or you know you'll make me angry.\"\n\n\"I do so like to see you angry. And when that time comes, when that\nwedding does take place, then I will be a bridesmaid, Trichy. Yes!\neven though I am not invited. Yes! though all the de Courcys in\nBarsetshire should tread upon me and obliterate me. Though I should\nbe as dust among the stars, though I should creep up in calico among\ntheir satins and lace, I will nevertheless be there; close, close to\nthe bride; to hold something for her, to touch her dress, to feel\nthat I am near to her, to--to--to--\" and she threw her arms round her\ncompanion, and kissed her over and over again. \"No, Trichy; I won't\nbe Augusta's bridesmaid; I'll bide my time for bridesmaiding.\"\n\nWhat protestations Beatrice made against the probability of such an\nevent as foreshadowed in her friend's promise we will not repeat. The\nafternoon was advancing, and the ladies also had to dress for dinner,\nto do honour to the young heir.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nFrank Gresham's First Speech\n\n\nWe have said, that over and above those assembled in the house, there\ncame to the Greshamsbury dinner on Frank's birthday the Jacksons\nof the Grange, consisting of Mr and Mrs Jackson; the Batesons from\nAnnesgrove, viz., Mr and Mrs Bateson, and Miss Bateson, their\ndaughter--an unmarried lady of about fifty; the Bakers of Mill Hill,\nfather and son; and Mr Caleb Oriel, the rector, with his beautiful\nsister, Patience. Dr Thorne, and his niece Mary, we count among those\nalready assembled at Greshamsbury.\n\nThere was nothing very magnificent in the number of the guests thus\nbrought together to do honour to young Frank; but he, perhaps, was\ncalled on to take a more prominent part in the proceedings, to be\nmade more of a hero than would have been the case had half the county\nbeen there. In that case the importance of the guests would have been\nso great that Frank would have got off with a half-muttered speech or\ntwo; but now he had to make a separate oration to every one, and very\nweary work he found it.\n\nThe Batesons, Bakers, and Jacksons were very civil; no doubt the more\nso from an unconscious feeling on their part, that as the squire was\nknown to be a little out at elbows as regards money, any deficiency\non their part might be considered as owing to the present state\nof affairs at Greshamsbury. Fourteen thousand a year will receive\nhonour; in that case there is no doubt, and the man absolutely\npossessing it is not apt to be suspicious as to the treatment he may\nreceive; but the ghost of fourteen thousand a year is not always so\nself-assured. Mr Baker, with his moderate income, was a very much\nricher man than the squire; and, therefore, he was peculiarly forward\nin congratulating Frank on the brilliancy of his prospects.\n\nPoor Frank had hardly anticipated what there would be to do, and\nbefore dinner was announced he was very tired of it. He had no warmer\nfeeling for any of the grand cousins than a very ordinary cousinly\nlove; and he had resolved, forgetful of birth and blood, and all\nthose gigantic considerations which, now that manhood had come upon\nhim, he was bound always to bear in mind,--he had resolved to sneak\nout to dinner comfortably with Mary Thorne if possible; and if not\nwith Mary, then with his other love, Patience Oriel.\n\nGreat, therefore, was his consternation at finding that, after being\nkept continually in the foreground for half an hour before dinner, he\nhad to walk out to the dining-room with his aunt the countess, and\ntake his father's place for the day at the bottom of the table.\n\n\"It will now depend altogether upon yourself, Frank, whether you\nmaintain or lose that high position in the county which has been held\nby the Greshams for so many years,\" said the countess, as she walked\nthrough the spacious hall, resolving to lose no time in teaching\nto her nephew that great lesson which it was so imperative that he\nshould learn.\n\nFrank took this as an ordinary lecture, meant to inculcate general\ngood conduct, such as old bores of aunts are apt to inflict on\nyouthful victims in the shape of nephews and nieces.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Frank; \"I suppose so; and I mean to go along all square,\naunt, and no mistake. When I get back to Cambridge, I'll read like\nbricks.\"\n\nHis aunt did not care two straws about his reading. It was not by\nreading that the Greshams of Greshamsbury had held their heads up in\nthe county, but by having high blood and plenty of money. The blood\nhad come naturally to this young man; but it behoved him to look for\nthe money in a great measure himself. She, Lady de Courcy, could\ndoubtless help him; she might probably be able to fit him with a wife\nwho would bring her money onto his birth. His reading was a matter in\nwhich she could in no way assist him; whether his taste might lead\nhim to prefer books or pictures, or dogs and horses, or turnips in\ndrills, or old Italian plates and dishes, was a matter which did not\nmuch signify; with which it was not at all necessary that his noble\naunt should trouble herself.\n\n\"Oh! you are going to Cambridge again, are you? Well, if your father\nwishes it;--though very little is ever gained now by a university\nconnexion.\"\n\n\"I am to take my degree in October, aunt; and I am determined, at any\nrate, that I won't be plucked.\"\n\n\"Plucked!\"\n\n\"No; I won't be plucked. Baker was plucked last year, and all because\nhe got into the wrong set at John's. He's an excellent fellow if you\nknew him. He got among a set of men who did nothing but smoke and\ndrink beer. Malthusians, we call them.\"\n\n\"Malthusians!\"\n\n\"'Malt,' you know, aunt, and 'use;' meaning that they drink beer. So\npoor Harry Baker got plucked. I don't know that a fellow's any the\nworse; however, I won't get plucked.\"\n\nBy this time the party had taken their place round the long board,\nMr Gresham sitting at the top, in the place usually occupied by Lady\nArabella. She, on the present occasion, sat next to her son on the\none side, as the countess did on the other. If, therefore, Frank now\nwent astray, it would not be from want of proper leading.\n\n\"Aunt, will you have some beef?\" said he, as soon as the soup\nand fish had been disposed of, anxious to perform the rites of\nhospitality now for the first time committed to his charge.\n\n\"Do not be in a hurry, Frank,\" said his mother; \"the servants will--\"\n\n\"Oh! ah! I forgot; there are cutlets and those sort of things. My\nhand is not in yet for this work, aunt. Well, as I was saying about\nCambridge--\"\n\n\"Is Frank to go back to Cambridge, Arabella?\" said the countess to\nher sister-in-law, speaking across her nephew.\n\n\"So his father seems to say.\"\n\n\"Is it not a waste of time?\" asked the countess.\n\n\"You know I never interfere,\" said the Lady Arabella; \"I never liked\nthe idea of Cambridge myself at all. All the de Courcys were Christ\nChurch men; but the Greshams, it seems, were always at Cambridge.\"\n\n\"Would it not be better to send him abroad at once?\"\n\n\"Much better, I would think,\" said the Lady Arabella; \"but you know,\nI never interfere: perhaps you would speak to Mr Gresham.\"\n\nThe countess smiled grimly, and shook her head with a decidedly\nnegative shake. Had she said out loud to the young man, \"Your father\nis such an obstinate, pig-headed, ignorant fool, that it is no use\nspeaking to him; it would be wasting fragrance on the desert air,\"\nshe could not have spoken more plainly. The effect on Frank was this:\nthat he said to himself, speaking quite as plainly as Lady de Courcy\nhad spoken by her shake of the face, \"My mother and aunt are always\ndown on the governor, always; but the more they are down on him the\nmore I'll stick to him. I certainly will take my degree: I will read\nlike bricks; and I'll begin to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Now will you take some beef, aunt?\" This was said out loud.\n\nThe Countess de Courcy was very anxious to go on with her lesson\nwithout loss of time; but she could not, while surrounded by guests\nand servants, enunciate the great secret: \"You must marry money,\nFrank; that is your one great duty; that is the matter to be borne\nsteadfastly in your mind.\" She could not now, with sufficient weight\nand impress of emphasis, pour this wisdom into his ears; the more\nespecially as he was standing up to his work of carving, and was deep\nto his elbows in horse-radish, fat, and gravy. So the countess sat\nsilent while the banquet proceeded.\n\n\"Beef, Harry?\" shouted the young heir to his friend Baker. \"Oh! but I\nsee it isn't your turn yet. I beg your pardon, Miss Bateson,\" and he\nsent to that lady a pound and a half of excellent meat, cut out with\ngreat energy in one slice, about half an inch thick.\n\nAnd so the banquet went on.\n\nBefore dinner Frank had found himself obliged to make numerous small\nspeeches in answer to the numerous individual congratulations of his\nfriends; but these were as nothing to the one great accumulated onus\nof an oration which he had long known that he should have to sustain\nafter the cloth was taken away. Someone of course would propose his\nhealth, and then there would be a clatter of voices, ladies and\ngentlemen, men and girls; and when that was done he would find\nhimself standing on his legs, with the room about him, going round\nand round and round.\n\nHaving had a previous hint of this, he had sought advice from his\ncousin, the Honourable George, whom he regarded as a dab at speaking;\nat least, so he had heard the Honourable George say of himself.\n\n\"What the deuce is a fellow to say, George, when he stands up after\nthe clatter is done?\"\n\n\"Oh, it's the easiest thing in life,\" said the cousin. \"Only remember\nthis: you mustn't get astray; that is what they call presence of\nmind, you know. I'll tell you what I do, and I'm often called up, you\nknow; at our agriculturals I always propose the farmers' daughters:\nwell, what I do is this--I keep my eye steadfastly fixed on one of\nthe bottles, and never move it.\"\n\n\"On one of the bottles!\" said Frank; \"wouldn't it be better if I made\na mark of some old covey's head? I don't like looking at the table.\"\n\n\"The old covey'd move, and then you'd be done; besides there isn't\nthe least use in the world in looking up. I've heard people say, who\ngo to those sort of dinners every day of their lives, that whenever\nanything witty is said; the fellow who says it is sure to be looking\nat the mahogany.\"\n\n\"Oh, you know I shan't say anything witty; I'll be quite the other\nway.\"\n\n\"But there's no reason you shouldn't learn the manner. That's the way\nI succeeded. Fix your eye on one of the bottles; put your thumbs in\nyour waist-coat pockets; stick out your elbows, bend your knees a\nlittle, and then go ahead.\"\n\n\"Oh, ah! go ahead; that's all very well; but you can't go ahead if\nyou haven't got any steam.\"\n\n\"A very little does it. There can be nothing so easy as your speech.\nWhen one has to say something new every year about the farmers'\ndaughters, why one has to use one's brains a bit. Let's see: how will\nyou begin? Of course, you'll say that you are not accustomed to this\nsort of thing; that the honour conferred upon you is too much for\nyour feelings; that the bright array of beauty and talent around\nyou quite overpowers your tongue, and all that sort of thing. Then\ndeclare you're a Gresham to the backbone.\"\n\n\"Oh, they know that.\"\n\n\"Well, tell them again. Then of course you must say something about\nus; or you'll have the countess as black as old Nick.\"\n\n\"Abut my aunt, George? What on earth can I say about her when she's\nthere herself before me?\"\n\n\"Before you! of course; that's just the reason. Oh, say any lie you\ncan think of; you must say something about us. You know we've come\ndown from London on purpose.\"\n\nFrank, in spite of the benefit he was receiving from his cousin's\nerudition, could not help wishing in his heart that they had all\nremained in London; but this he kept to himself. He thanked his\ncousin for his hints, and though he did not feel that the trouble\nof his mind was completely cured, he began to hope that he might go\nthrough the ordeal without disgracing himself.\n\nNevertheless, he felt rather sick at heart when Mr Baker got up to\npropose the toast as soon as the servants were gone. The servants,\nthat is, were gone officially; but they were there in a body, men\nand women, nurses, cooks, and ladies' maids, coachmen, grooms, and\nfootmen, standing in two doorways to hear what Master Frank would\nsay. The old housekeeper headed the maids at one door, standing\nboldly inside the room; and the butler controlled the men at the\nother, marshalling them back with a drawn corkscrew.\n\nMr Baker did not say much; but what he did say, he said well. They\nhad all seen Frank Gresham grow up from a child; and were now\nrequired to welcome as a man amongst them one who was well qualified\nto carry on the honour of that loved and respected family. His\nyoung friend, Frank, was every inch a Gresham. Mr Baker omitted to\nmake mention of the infusion of de Courcy blood, and the countess,\ntherefore, drew herself up on her chair and looked as though she were\nextremely bored. He then alluded tenderly to his own long friendship\nwith the present squire, Francis Newbold Gresham the elder; and sat\ndown, begging them to drink health, prosperity, long life, and an\nexcellent wife to their dear young friend, Francis Newbold Gresham\nthe younger.\n\nThere was a great jingling of glasses, of course; made the merrier\nand the louder by the fact that the ladies were still there as\nwell as the gentlemen. Ladies don't drink toasts frequently; and,\ntherefore, the occasion coming rarely was the more enjoyed. \"God\nbless you, Frank!\" \"Your good health, Frank!\" \"And especially a\ngood wife, Frank!\" \"Two or three of them, Frank!\" \"Good health and\nprosperity to you, Mr Gresham!\" \"More power to you, Frank, my boy!\"\n\"May God bless you and preserve you, my dear boy!\" and then a merry,\nsweet, eager voice from the far end of the table, \"Frank! Frank! Do\nlook at me, pray do Frank; I am drinking your health in real wine;\nain't I, papa?\" Such were the addresses which greeted Mr Francis\nNewbold Gresham the younger as he essayed to rise up on his feet for\nthe first time since he had come to man's estate.\n\nWhen the clatter was at an end, and he was fairly on his legs, he\ncast a glance before him on the table, to look for a decanter. He\nhad not much liked his cousin's theory of sticking to the bottle;\nnevertheless, in the difficulty of the moment, it was well to have\nany system to go by. But, as misfortune would have it, though the\ntable was covered with bottles, his eye could not catch one. Indeed,\nhis eye first could catch nothing, for the things swam before him,\nand the guests all seemed to dance in their chairs.\n\nUp he got, however, and commenced his speech. As he could not follow\nhis preceptor's advice as touching the bottle, he adopted his own\ncrude plan of \"making a mark on some old covey's head,\" and therefore\nlooked dead at the doctor.\n\n\"Upon my word, I am very much obliged to you, gentlemen and ladies,\nladies and gentlemen, I should say, for drinking my health, and\ndoing me so much honour, and all that sort of thing. Upon my word I\nam. Especially to Mr Baker. I don't mean you, Harry, you're not Mr\nBaker.\"\n\n\"As much as you're Mr Gresham, Master Frank.\"\n\n\"But I am not Mr Gresham; and I don't mean to be for many a long year\nif I can help it; not at any rate till we have had another coming of\nage here.\"\n\n\"Bravo, Frank; and whose will that be?\"\n\n\"That will be my son, and a very fine lad he will be; and I hope\nhe'll make a better speech than his father. Mr Baker said I was every\ninch a Gresham. Well, I hope I am.\" Here the countess began to look\ncold and angry. \"I hope the day will never come when my father won't\nown me for one.\"\n\n\"There's no fear, no fear,\" said the doctor, who was almost put out\nof countenance by the orator's intense gaze. The countess looked\ncolder and more angry, and muttered something to herself about a\nbear-garden.\n\n\"Gardez Gresham; eh? Harry! mind that when you're sticking in a gap\nand I'm coming after you. Well, I am sure I am very obliged to you\nfor the honour you have all done me, especially the ladies, who don't\ndo this sort of thing on ordinary occasions. I wish they did; don't\nyou, doctor? And talking of the ladies, my aunt and cousins have come\nall the way from London to hear me make this speech, which certainly\nis not worth the trouble; but, all the same I am very much obliged\nto them.\" And he looked round and made a little bow at the countess.\n\"And so I am to Mr and Mrs Jackson, and Mr and Mrs and Miss Bateson,\nand Mr Baker--I'm not at all obliged to you, Harry--and to Mr Oriel\nand Miss Oriel, and to Mr Umbleby, and to Dr Thorne, and to Mary--I\nbeg her pardon, I mean Miss Thorne.\" And then he sat down, amid the\nloud plaudits of the company, and a string of blessings which came\nfrom the servants behind him.\n\nAfter this the ladies rose and departed. As she went, Lady Arabella,\nkissed her son's forehead, and then his sisters kissed him, and one\nor two of his lady-cousins; and then Miss Bateson shook him by the\nhand. \"Oh, Miss Bateson,\" said he, \"I thought the kissing was to go\nall round.\" So Miss Bateson laughed and went her way; and Patience\nOriel nodded at him, but Mary Thorne, as she quietly left the room,\nalmost hidden among the extensive draperies of the grander ladies,\nhardly allowed her eyes to meet his.\n\nHe got up to hold the door for them as they passed; and as they went,\nhe managed to take Patience by the hand; he took her hand and pressed\nit for a moment, but dropped it quickly, in order that he might go\nthrough the same ceremony with Mary, but Mary was too quick for him.\n\n\"Frank,\" said Mr Gresham, as soon as the door was closed, \"bring\nyour glass here, my boy;\" and the father made room for his son close\nbeside himself. \"The ceremony is now over, so you may have your place\nof dignity.\" Frank sat himself down where he was told, and Mr Gresham\nput his hand on his son's shoulder and half caressed him, while the\ntears stood in his eyes. \"I think the doctor is right, Baker, I think\nhe'll never make us ashamed of him.\"\n\n\"I am sure he never will,\" said Mr Baker.\n\n\"I don't think he ever will,\" said Dr Thorne.\n\nThe tones of the men's voices were very different. Mr Baker did not\ncare a straw about it; why should he? He had an heir of his own as\nwell as the squire; one also who was the apple of _his_ eye. But the\ndoctor,--he did care; he had a niece, to be sure, whom he loved,\nperhaps as well as these men loved their sons; but there was room in\nhis heart also for young Frank Gresham.\n\nAfter this small expos\u00c3\u00a9 of feeling they sat silent for a moment or\ntwo. But silence was not dear to the heart of the Honourable John,\nand so he took up the running.\n\n\"That's a niceish nag you gave Frank this morning,\" he said to his\nuncle. \"I was looking at him before dinner. He is a Monsoon, isn't\nhe?\"\n\n\"Well I can't say I know how he was bred,\" said the squire. \"He shows\na good deal of breeding.\"\n\n\"He's a Monsoon, I'm sure,\" said the Honourable John. \"They've all\nthose ears, and that peculiar dip in the back. I suppose you gave a\ngoodish figure for him?\"\n\n\"Not so very much,\" said the squire.\n\n\"He's a trained hunter, I suppose?\"\n\n\"If not, he soon will be,\" said the squire.\n\n\"Let Frank alone for that,\" said Harry Baker.\n\n\"He jumps beautifully, sir,\" said Frank. \"I haven't tried him myself,\nbut Peter made him go over the bar two or three times this morning.\"\n\nThe Honourable John was determined to give his cousin a helping hand,\nas he considered it. He thought that Frank was very ill-used in being\nput off with so incomplete a stud, and thinking also that the son had\nnot spirit enough to attack his father himself on the subject, the\nHonourable John determined to do it for him.\n\n\"He's the making of a very nice horse, I don't doubt. I wish you had\na string like him, Frank.\"\n\nFrank felt the blood rush to his face. He would not for worlds have\nhis father think that he was discontented, or otherwise than pleased\nwith the present he had received that morning. He was heartily\nashamed of himself in that he had listened with a certain degree of\ncomplacency to his cousin's tempting; but he had no idea that the\nsubject would be repeated--and then repeated, too, before his father,\nin a manner to vex him on such a day as this, before such people as\nwere assembled there. He was very angry with his cousin, and for a\nmoment forgot all his hereditary respect for a de Courcy.\n\n\"I tell you what, John,\" said he, \"do you choose your day, some day\nearly in the season, and come out on the best thing you have, and\nI'll bring, not the black horse, but my old mare; and then do you try\nand keep near me. If I don't leave you at the back of Godspeed before\nlong, I'll give you the mare and the horse too.\"\n\nThe Honourable John was not known in Barsetshire as one of the most\nforward of its riders. He was a man much addicted to hunting, as far\nas the get-up of the thing was concerned; he was great in boots and\nbreeches; wondrously conversant with bits and bridles; he had quite\na collection of saddles; and patronised every newest invention for\ncarrying spare shoes, sandwiches, and flasks of sherry. He was\nprominent at the cover side;--some people, including the master\nof hounds, thought him perhaps a little too loudly prominent;\nhe affected a familiarity with the dogs, and was on speaking\nacquaintance with every man's horse. But when the work was cut out,\nwhen the pace began to be sharp, when it behoved a man either to ride\nor visibly to decline to ride, then--so at least said they who had\nnot the de Courcy interest quite closely at heart--then, in those\nheart-stirring moments, the Honourable John was too often found\ndeficient.\n\nThere was, therefore, a considerable laugh at his expense when Frank,\ninstigated to his innocent boast by a desire to save his father,\nchallenged his cousin to a trial of prowess. The Honourable John\nwas not, perhaps, as much accustomed to the ready use of his tongue\nas was his honourable brother, seeing that it was not his annual\nbusiness to depict the glories of the farmers' daughters; at any\nrate, on this occasion he seemed to be at some loss for words; he\nshut up, as the slang phrase goes, and made no further allusion to\nthe necessity of supplying young Gresham with a proper string of\nhunters.\n\nBut the old squire had understood it all; had understood the meaning\nof his nephew's attack; had thoroughly understood also the meaning of\nhis son's defence, and the feeling which actuated it. He also had\nthought of the stableful of horses which had belonged to himself when\nhe came of age; and of the much more humble position which his son\nwould have to fill than that which _his_ father had prepared for him.\nHe thought of this, and was sad enough, though he had sufficient\nspirit to hide from his friends around him the fact, that the\nHonourable John's arrow had not been discharged in vain.\n\n\"He shall have Champion,\" said the father to himself. \"It is time for\nme to give it up.\"\n\nNow Champion was one of the two fine old hunters which the squire\nkept for his own use. And it might have been said of him now, at the\nperiod of which we are speaking, that the only really happy moments\nof his life were those which he spent in the field. So much as to its\nbeing time for him to give up.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nFrank Gresham's Early Loves\n\n\nIt was, we have said, the first of July, and such being the time of\nthe year, the ladies, after sitting in the drawing-room for half an\nhour or so, began to think that they might as well go through the\ndrawing-room windows on to the lawn. First one slipped out a little\nway, and then another; and then they got on to the lawn; and then\nthey talked of their hats; till, by degrees, the younger ones of the\nparty, and at last of the elder also, found themselves dressed for\nwalking.\n\nThe windows, both of the drawing-room and the dining-room, looked out\non to the lawn; and it was only natural that the girls should walk\nfrom the former to the latter. It was only natural that they, being\nthere, should tempt their swains to come to them by the sight of\ntheir broad-brimmed hats and evening dresses; and natural, also, that\nthe temptation should not be resisted. The squire, therefore, and the\nelder male guests soon found themselves alone round their wine.\n\n\"Upon my word, we were enchanted by your eloquence, Mr Gresham, were\nwe not?\" said Miss Oriel, turning to one of the de Courcy girls who\nwas with her.\n\nMiss Oriel was a very pretty girl; a little older than Frank\nGresham,--perhaps a year or so. She had dark hair, large round dark\neyes, a nose a little too broad, a pretty mouth, a beautiful chin,\nand, as we have said before, a large fortune;--that is, moderately\nlarge--let us say twenty thousand pounds, there or thereabouts.\nShe and her brother had been living at Greshamsbury for the last\ntwo years, the living having been purchased for him--such were\nMr Gresham's necessities--during the lifetime of the last old\nincumbent. Miss Oriel was in every respect a nice neighbour; she was\ngood-humoured, lady-like, lively, neither too clever nor too stupid,\nbelonging to a good family, sufficiently fond of this world's good\nthings, as became a pretty young lady so endowed, and sufficiently\nfond, also, of the other world's good things, as became the mistress\nof a clergyman's house.\n\n\"Indeed, yes,\" said the Lady Margaretta. \"Frank is very eloquent.\nWhen he described our rapid journey from London, he nearly moved me\nto tears. But well as he talks, I think he carves better.\"\n\n\"I wish you'd had to do it, Margaretta; both the carving and\ntalking.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Frank; you're very civil.\"\n\n\"But there's one comfort, Miss Oriel; it's over now, and done. A\nfellow can't be made to come of age twice.\"\n\n\"But you'll take your degree, Mr Gresham; and then, of course,\nthere'll be another speech; and then you'll get married, and there\nwill be two or three more.\"\n\n\"I'll speak at your wedding, Miss Oriel, long before I do at my own.\"\n\n\"I shall not have the slightest objection. It will be so kind of you\nto patronise my husband.\"\n\n\"But, by Jove, will he patronise me? I know you'll marry some awful\nbigwig, or some terribly clever fellow; won't she, Margaretta?\"\n\n\"Miss Oriel was saying so much in praise of you before you came out,\"\nsaid Margaretta, \"that I began to think that her mind was intent on\nremaining at Greshamsbury all her life.\"\n\nFrank blushed, and Patience laughed. There was but a year's\ndifference in their age; Frank, however, was still a boy, though\nPatience was fully a woman.\n\n\"I am ambitious, Lady Margaretta,\" said she. \"I own it; but I am\nmoderate in my ambition. I do love Greshamsbury, and if Mr Gresham\nhad a younger brother, perhaps, you know--\"\n\n\"Another just like myself, I suppose,\" said Frank.\n\n\"Oh, yes. I could not possibly wish for any change.\"\n\n\"Just as eloquent as you are, Frank,\" said the Lady Margaretta.\n\n\"And as good a carver,\" said Patience.\n\n\"Miss Bateson has lost her heart to him for ever, because of his\ncarving,\" said the Lady Margaretta.\n\n\"But perfection never repeats itself,\" said Patience.\n\n\"Well, you see, I have not got any brothers,\" said Frank; \"so all I\ncan do is to sacrifice myself.\"\n\n\"Upon my word, Mr Gresham, I am under more than ordinary obligations\nto you; I am indeed,\" and Miss Oriel stood still in the path, and\nmade a very graceful curtsy. \"Dear me! only think, Lady Margaretta,\nthat I should be honoured with an offer from the heir the very moment\nhe is legally entitled to make one.\"\n\n\"And done with so much true gallantry, too,\" said the other;\n\"expressing himself quite willing to postpone any views of his own or\nyour advantage.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Patience; \"that's what I value so much: had he loved me\nnow, there would have been no merit on his part; but a sacrifice, you\nknow--\"\n\n\"Yes, ladies are so fond of such sacrifices, Frank, upon my word, I\nhad no idea you were so very excellent at making speeches.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Frank, \"I shouldn't have said sacrifice, that was a\nslip; what I meant was--\"\n\n\"Oh, dear me,\" said Patience, \"wait a minute; now we are going\nto have a regular declaration. Lady Margaretta, you haven't got\na scent-bottle, have you? And if I should faint, where's the\ngarden-chair?\"\n\n\"Oh, but I'm not going to make a declaration at all,\" said Frank.\n\n\"Are you not? Oh! Now, Lady Margaretta, I appeal to you; did you not\nunderstand him to say something very particular?\"\n\n\"Certainly, I thought nothing could be plainer,\" said the Lady\nMargaretta.\n\n\"And so, Mr Gresham, I am to be told, that after all it means\nnothing,\" said Patience, putting her handkerchief up to her eyes.\n\n\"It means that you are an excellent hand at quizzing a fellow like\nme.\"\n\n\"Quizzing! No; but you are an excellent hand at deceiving a poor\ngirl like me. Well, remember I have got a witness; here is Lady\nMargaretta, who heard it all. What a pity it is that my brother is\na clergyman. You calculated on that, I know; or you would never had\nserved me so.\"\n\nShe said so just as her brother joined them, or rather just as he\nhad joined Lady Margaretta de Courcy; for her ladyship and Mr Oriel\nwalked on in advance by themselves. Lady Margaretta had found it\nrather dull work, making a third in Miss Oriel's flirtation with her\ncousin; the more so as she was quite accustomed to take a principal\npart herself in all such transactions. She therefore not unwillingly\nwalked on with Mr Oriel. Mr Oriel, it must be conceived, was not a\ncommon, everyday parson, but had points about him which made him\nquite fit to associate with an earl's daughter. And as it was known\nthat he was not a marrying man, having very exalted ideas on that\npoint connected with his profession, the Lady Margaretta, of course,\nhad the less objection to trust herself alone with him.\n\nBut directly she was gone, Miss Oriel's tone of banter ceased. It was\nvery well making a fool of a lad of twenty-one when others were by;\nbut there might be danger in it when they were alone together.\n\n\"I don't know any position on earth more enviable than yours, Mr\nGresham,\" said she, quite soberly and earnestly; \"how happy you ought\nto be.\"\n\n\"What, in being laughed at by you, Miss Oriel, for pretending to be\na man, when you choose to make out that I am only a boy? I can bear\nto be laughed at pretty well generally, but I can't say that your\nlaughing at me makes me feel so happy as you say I ought to be.\"\n\nFrank was evidently of an opinion totally different from that of Miss\nOriel. Miss Oriel, when she found herself _t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aate_ with him,\nthought it was time to give over flirting; Frank, however, imagined\nthat it was just the moment for him to begin. So he spoke and looked\nvery languishing, and put on him quite the airs of an Orlando.\n\n\"Oh, Mr Gresham, such good friends as you and I may laugh at each\nother, may we not?\"\n\n\"You may do what you like, Miss Oriel: beautiful women I believe\nalways may; but you remember what the spider said to the fly, 'That\nwhich is sport to you, may be death to me.'\" Anyone looking at\nFrank's face as he said this, might well have imagined that he was\nbreaking his very heart for love of Miss Oriel. Oh, Master Frank!\nMaster Frank! if you act thus in the green leaf, what will you do in\nthe dry?\n\nWhile Frank Gresham was thus misbehaving himself, and going on as\nthough to him belonged the privilege of falling in love with pretty\nfaces, as it does to ploughboys and other ordinary people, his great\ninterests were not forgotten by those guardian saints who were so\nanxious to shower down on his head all manner of temporal blessings.\n\nAnother conversation had taken place in the Greshamsbury gardens,\nin which nothing light had been allowed to present itself; nothing\nfrivolous had been spoken. The countess, the Lady Arabella, and Miss\nGresham had been talking over Greshamsbury affairs, and they had\nlatterly been assisted by the Lady Amelia, than whom no de Courcy\never born was more wise, more solemn, more prudent, or more proud.\nThe ponderosity of her qualifications for nobility was sometimes too\nmuch even for her mother, and her devotion to the peerage was such,\nthat she would certainly have declined a seat in heaven if offered to\nher without the promise that it should be in the upper house.\n\nThe subject first discussed had been Augusta's prospects. Mr Moffat\nhad been invited to Courcy Castle, and Augusta had been taken thither\nto meet him, with the express intention on the part of the countess,\nthat they should be man and wife. The countess had been careful to\nmake it intelligible to her sister-in-law and niece, that though Mr\nMoffat would do excellently well for a daughter of Greshamsbury, he\ncould not be allowed to raise his eyes to a female scion of Courcy\nCastle.\n\n\"Not that we personally dislike him,\" said the Lady Amelia; \"but rank\nhas its drawbacks, Augusta.\" As the Lady Amelia was now somewhat\nnearer forty than thirty, and was still allowed to walk,\n\n\n   \"In maiden meditation, fancy free,\"\n\n\nit may be presumed that in her case rank had been found to have\nserious drawbacks.\n\nTo this Augusta said nothing in objection. Whether desirable by a\nde Courcy or not, the match was to be hers, and there was no doubt\nwhatever as to the wealth of the man whose name she was to take; the\noffer had been made, not to her, but to her aunt; the acceptance\nhad been expressed, not by her, but by her aunt. Had she thought of\nrecapitulating in her memory all that had ever passed between Mr\nMoffat and herself, she would have found that it did not amount to\nmore than the most ordinary conversation between chance partners\nin a ball-room. Nevertheless, she was to be Mrs Moffat. All that Mr\nGresham knew of him was, that when he met the young man for the first\nand only time in his life, he found him extremely hard to deal with\nin the matter of money. He had insisted on having ten thousand pounds\nwith his wife, and at last refused to go on with the match unless\nhe got six thousand pounds. This latter sum the poor squire had\nundertaken to pay him.\n\nMr Moffat had been for a year or two M.P. for Barchester; having\nbeen assisted in his views on that ancient city by all the de\nCourcy interest. He was a Whig, of course. Not only had Barchester,\ndeparting from the light of other days, returned a Whig member of\nParliament, but it was declared, that at the next election, now near\nat hand, a Radical would be sent up, a man pledged to the ballot, to\neconomies of all sorts, one who would carry out Barchester politics\nin all their abrupt, obnoxious, pestilent virulence. This was one\nScatcherd, a great railway contractor, a man who was a native of\nBarchester, who had bought property in the neighbourhood, and who had\nachieved a sort of popularity there and elsewhere by the violence of\nhis democratic opposition to the aristocracy. According to this man's\npolitical tenets, the Conservatives should be laughed at as fools,\nbut the Whigs should be hated as knaves.\n\nMr Moffat was now coming down to Courcy Castle to look after his\nelectioneering interests, and Miss Gresham was to return with her\naunt to meet him. The countess was very anxious that Frank should\nalso accompany them. Her great doctrine, that he must marry money,\nhad been laid down with authority, and received without doubt. She\nnow pushed it further, and said that no time should be lost; that\nhe should not only marry money, but do so very early in life; there\nwas always danger in delay. The Greshams--of course she alluded only\nto the males of the family--were foolishly soft-hearted; no one\ncould say what might happen. There was that Miss Thorne always at\nGreshamsbury.\n\nThis was more than the Lady Arabella could stand. She protested\nthat there was at least no ground for supposing that Frank would\nabsolutely disgrace his family.\n\nStill the countess persisted: \"Perhaps not,\" she said; \"but when\nyoung people of perfectly different ranks were allowed to associate\ntogether, there was no saying what danger might arise. They all knew\nthat old Mr Bateson--the present Mr Bateson's father--had gone off\nwith the governess; and young Mr Everbeery, near Taunton, had only\nthe other day married a cook-maid.\"\n\n\"But Mr Everbeery was always drunk, aunt,\" said Augusta, feeling\ncalled upon to say something for her brother.\n\n\"Never mind, my dear; these things do happen, and they are very\ndreadful.\"\n\n\"Horrible!\" said the Lady Amelia; \"diluting the best blood of the\ncountry, and paving the way for revolutions.\" This was very grand;\nbut, nevertheless, Augusta could not but feel that she perhaps might\nbe about to dilute the blood of her coming children in marrying the\ntailor's son. She consoled herself by trusting that, at any rate, she\npaved the way for no revolutions.\n\n\"When a thing is so necessary,\" said the countess, \"it cannot be done\ntoo soon. Now, Arabella, I don't say that anything will come of it;\nbut it may: Miss Dunstable is coming down to us next week. Now, we\nall know that when old Dunstable died last year, he left over two\nhundred thousand to his daughter.\"\n\n\"It is a great deal of money, certainly,\" said Lady Arabella.\n\n\"It would pay off everything, and a great deal more,\" said the\ncountess.\n\n\"It was ointment, was it not, aunt?\" said Augusta.\n\n\"I believe so, my dear; something called the ointment of Lebanon, or\nsomething of that sort: but there's no doubt about the money.\"\n\n\"But how old is she, Rosina?\" asked the anxious mother.\n\n\"About thirty, I suppose; but I don't think that much signifies.\"\n\n\"Thirty,\" said Lady Arabella, rather dolefully. \"And what is she\nlike? I think that Frank already begins to like girls that are young\nand pretty.\"\n\n\"But surely, aunt,\" said the Lady Amelia, \"now that he has come to\nman's discretion, he will not refuse to consider all that he owes to\nhis family. A Mr Gresham of Greshamsbury has a position to support.\"\nThe de Courcy scion spoke these last words in the sort of tone that a\nparish clergyman would use, in warning some young farmer's son that\nhe should not put himself on an equal footing with the ploughboys.\n\nIt was at last decided that the countess should herself convey to\nFrank a special invitation to Courcy Castle, and that when she got\nhim there, she should do all that lay in her power to prevent his\nreturn to Cambridge, and to further the Dunstable marriage.\n\n\"We did think of Miss Dunstable for Porlock, once,\" she said,\nna\u00c3\u00afvely; \"but when we found that it wasn't much over two hundred\nthousand, why, that idea fell to the ground.\" The terms on which the\nde Courcy blood might be allowed to dilute itself were, it must be\npresumed, very high indeed.\n\nAugusta was sent off to find her brother, and to send him to the\ncountess in the small drawing-room. Here the countess was to have\nher tea, apart from the outer common world, and here, without\ninterruption, she was to teach her great lesson to her nephew.\n\nAugusta did find her brother, and found him in the worst of bad\nsociety--so at least the stern de Courcys would have thought. Old Mr\nBateson and the governess, Mr Everbeery and his cook's diluted blood,\nand ways paved for revolutions, all presented themselves to Augusta's\nmind when she found her brother walking with no other company than\nMary Thorne, and walking with her, too, in much too close proximity.\n\nHow he had contrived to be off with the old love and so soon on with\nthe new, or rather, to be off with the new love and again on with the\nold, we will not stop to inquire. Had Lady Arabella, in truth, known\nall her son's doings in this way, could she have guessed how very\nnigh he had approached the iniquity of old Mr Bateson, and to the\nfolly of young Mr Everbeery, she would in truth have been in a hurry\nto send him off to Courcy Castle and Miss Dunstable. Some days\nbefore the commencement of our story, young Frank had sworn in sober\nearnest--in what he intended for his most sober earnest, his most\nearnest sobriety--that he loved Mary Thorne with a love for which\nwords could find no sufficient expression--with a love that could\nnever die, never grow dim, never become less, which no opposition on\nthe part of others could extinguish, which no opposition on her part\ncould repel; that he might, could, would, and should have her for his\nwife, and that if she told him she didn't love him, he would--\n\n\"Oh, oh! Mary; do you love me? Don't you love me? Won't you love me?\nSay you will. Oh, Mary, dearest Mary, will you? won't you? do you?\ndon't you? Come now, you have a right to give a fellow an answer.\"\n\nWith such eloquence had the heir of Greshamsbury, when not yet\ntwenty-one years of age, attempted to possess himself of the\naffections of the doctor's niece. And yet three days afterwards he\nwas quite ready to flirt with Miss Oriel.\n\nIf such things are done in the green wood, what will be done in the\ndry?\n\nAnd what had Mary said when these fervent protestations of an undying\nlove had been thrown at her feet? Mary, it must be remembered, was\nvery nearly of the same age as Frank; but, as I and others have so\noften said before, \"Women grow on the sunny side of the wall.\" Though\nFrank was only a boy, it behoved Mary to be something more than a\ngirl. Frank might be allowed, without laying himself open to much\njust reproach, to throw all of what he believed to be his heart into\na protestation of what he believed to be love; but Mary was in duty\nbound to be more thoughtful, more reticent, more aware of the facts\nof their position, more careful of her own feelings, and more careful\nalso of his.\n\nAnd yet she could not put him down as another young lady might put\ndown another young gentleman. It is very seldom that a young man,\nunless he be tipsy, assumes an unwelcome familiarity in his early\nacquaintance with any girl; but when acquaintance has been long and\nintimate, familiarity must follow as a matter of course. Frank and\nMary had been so much together in his holidays, had so constantly\nconsorted together as boys and girls, that, as regarded her, he had\nnot that innate fear of a woman which represses a young man's tongue;\nand she was so used to his good-humour, his fun, and high jovial\nspirits, and was, withal, so fond of them and him, that it was very\ndifficult for her to mark with accurate feeling, and stop with\nreserved brow, the shade of change from a boy's liking to a man's\nlove.\n\nAnd Beatrice, too, had done harm in this matter. With a spirit\npainfully unequal to that of her grand relatives, she had quizzed\nMary and Frank about their early flirtations. This she had done; but\nhad instinctively avoided doing so before her mother and sister, and\nhad thus made a secret of it, as it were, between herself, Mary, and\nher brother;--had given currency, as it were, to the idea that there\nmight be something serious between the two. Not that Beatrice had\never wished to promote a marriage between them, or had even thought\nof such a thing. She was girlish, thoughtless, imprudent, inartistic,\nand very unlike a de Courcy. Very unlike a de Courcy she was in all\nthat; but, nevertheless, she had the de Courcy veneration for blood,\nand, more than that, she had the Gresham feeling joined to that of\nthe de Courcys. The Lady Amelia would not for worlds have had the\nde Courcy blood defiled; but gold she thought could not defile.\nNow Beatrice was ashamed of her sister's marriage, and had often\ndeclared, within her own heart, that nothing could have made her\nmarry a Mr Moffat.\n\nShe had said so also to Mary, and Mary had told her that she was\nright. Mary also was proud of blood, was proud of her uncle's blood,\nand the two girls talked together in all the warmth of girlish\nconfidence, of the great glories of family traditions and family\nhonours. Beatrice had talked in utter ignorance as to her friend's\nbirth; and Mary, poor Mary, she had talked, being as ignorant; but\nnot without a strong suspicion that, at some future time, a day of\nsorrow would tell her some fearful truth.\n\nOn one point Mary's mind was strongly made up. No wealth, no mere\nworldly advantage could make any one her superior. If she were born\na gentlewoman, then was she fit to match with any gentleman. Let\nthe most wealthy man in Europe pour all his wealth at her feet, she\ncould, if so inclined, give him back at any rate more than that.\nThat offered at her feet she knew she would never tempt her to yield\nup the fortress of her heart, the guardianship of her soul, the\npossession of her mind; not that alone, nor that, even, as any\npossible slightest fraction of a make-weight.\n\nIf she were born a gentlewoman! And then came to her mind those\ncurious questions; what makes a gentleman? what makes a gentlewoman?\nWhat is the inner reality, the spiritualised quintessence of that\nprivilege in the world which men call rank, which forces the\nthousands and hundreds of thousands to bow down before the few elect?\nWhat gives, or can give it, or should give it?\n\nAnd she answered the question. Absolute, intrinsic, acknowledged,\nindividual merit must give it to its possessor, let him be whom, and\nwhat, and whence he might. So far the spirit of democracy was strong\nwith her. Beyond this it could be had but by inheritance, received\nas it were second-hand, or twenty-second-hand. And so far the spirit\nof aristocracy was strong within her. All this she had, as may be\nimagined, learnt in early years from her uncle; and all this she was\nat great pains to teach Beatrice Gresham, the chosen of her heart.\n\nWhen Frank declared that Mary had a right to give him an answer,\nhe meant that he had a right to expect one. Mary acknowledged this\nright, and gave it to him.\n\n\"Mr Gresham,\" she said.\n\n\"Oh, Mary; Mr Gresham!\"\n\n\"Yes, Mr Gresham. It must be Mr Gresham after that. And, moreover, it\nmust be Miss Thorne as well.\"\n\n\"I'll be shot if it shall, Mary.\"\n\n\"Well; I can't say that I shall be shot if it be not so; but if it be\nnot so, if you do not agree that it shall be so, I shall be turned\nout of Greshamsbury.\"\n\n\"What! you mean my mother?\" said Frank.\n\n\"Indeed, I mean no such thing,\" said Mary, with a flash from her eye\nthat made Frank almost start. \"I mean no such thing. I mean you, not\nyour mother. I am not in the least afraid of Lady Arabella; but I am\nafraid of you.\"\n\n\"Afraid of me, Mary!\"\n\n\"Miss Thorne; pray, pray, remember. It must be Miss Thorne. Do not\nturn me out of Greshamsbury. Do not separate me from Beatrice. It\nis you that will drive me out; no one else. I could stand my ground\nagainst your mother--I feel I could; but I cannot stand against you\nif you treat me otherwise than--than--\"\n\n\"Otherwise than what? I want to treat you as the girl I have chosen\nfrom all the world as my wife.\"\n\n\"I am sorry you should so soon have found it necessary to make a\nchoice. But, Mr Gresham, we must not joke about this at present. I am\nsure you would not willingly injure me; but if you speak to me, or of\nme, again in that way, you will injure me, injure me so much that I\nshall be forced to leave Greshamsbury in my own defence. I know you\nare too generous to drive me to that.\"\n\nAnd so the interview had ended. Frank, of course, went upstairs to\nsee if his new pocket-pistols were all ready, properly cleaned,\nloaded, and capped, should he find, after a few days' experience,\nthat prolonged existence was unendurable.\n\nHowever, he managed to live through the subsequent period; doubtless\nwith a view of preventing any disappointment to his father's guests.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nThe Doctor's Garden\n\n\nMary had contrived to quiet her lover with considerable propriety\nof demeanour. Then came on her the somewhat harder task of quieting\nherself. Young ladies, on the whole, are perhaps quite as susceptible\nof the softer feelings as young gentlemen are. Now Frank Gresham was\nhandsome, amiable, by no means a fool in intellect, excellent in\nheart; and he was, moreover, a gentleman, being the son of Mr Gresham\nof Greshamsbury. Mary had been, as it were, brought up to love him.\nHad aught but good happened to him, she would have cried as for a\nbrother. It must not therefore be supposed that when Frank Gresham\ntold her that he loved her, she had heard it altogether unconcerned.\n\nHe had not, perhaps, made his declaration with that propriety of\nlanguage in which such scenes are generally described as being\ncarried on. Ladies may perhaps think that Mary should have been\ndeterred, by the very boyishness of his manner, from thinking at all\nseriously on the subject. His \"will you, won't you--do you, don't\nyou?\" does not sound like the poetic raptures of a highly inspired\nlover. But, nevertheless, there had been warmth, and a reality in it\nnot in itself repulsive; and Mary's anger--anger? no, not anger--her\nobjections to the declarations were probably not based on the\nabsurdity of her lover's language.\n\nWe are inclined to think that these matters are not always discussed\nby mortal lovers in the poetically passionate phraseology which is\ngenerally thought to be appropriate for their description. A man\ncannot well describe that which he has never seen nor heard; but\nthe absolute words and acts of one such scene did once come to the\nauthor's knowledge. The couple were by no means plebeian, or below\nthe proper standard of high bearing and high breeding; they were\na handsome pair, living among educated people, sufficiently given\nto mental pursuits, and in every way what a pair of polite lovers\nought to be. The all-important conversation passed in this wise. The\nsite of the passionate scene was the sea-shore, on which they were\nwalking, in autumn.\n\nGentleman. \"Well, Miss ----, the long and short of it is this: here\nI am; you can take me or leave me.\"\n\nLady--scratching a gutter on the sand with her parasol, so as to\nallow a little salt water to run out of one hole into another. \"Of\ncourse, I know that's all nonsense.\"\n\nGentleman. \"Nonsense! By Jove, it isn't nonsense at all: come, Jane;\nhere I am: come, at any rate you can say something.\"\n\nLady. \"Yes, I suppose I can say something.\"\n\nGentleman. \"Well, which is it to be; take me or leave me?\"\n\nLady--very slowly, and with a voice perhaps hardly articulate,\ncarrying on, at the same time, her engineering works on a wider\nscale. \"Well, I don't exactly want to leave you.\"\n\nAnd so the matter was settled: settled with much propriety and\nsatisfaction; and both the lady and gentleman would have thought, had\nthey ever thought about the matter at all, that this, the sweetest\nmoment of their lives, had been graced by all the poetry by which\nsuch moments ought to be hallowed.\n\nWhen Mary had, as she thought, properly subdued young Frank, the\noffer of whose love she, at any rate, knew was, at such a period of\nhis life, an utter absurdity, then she found it necessary to subdue\nherself. What happiness on earth could be greater than the possession\nof such a love, had the true possession been justly and honestly\nwithin her reach? What man could be more lovable than such a man as\nwould grow from such a boy? And then, did she not love him,--love him\nalready, without waiting for any change? Did she not feel that there\nwas that about him, about him and about herself, too, which might so\nwell fit them for each other? It would be so sweet to be the sister\nof Beatrice, the daughter of the squire, to belong to Greshamsbury as\na part and parcel of itself.\n\nBut though she could not restrain these thoughts, it never for a\nmoment occurred to her to take Frank's offer in earnest. Though she\nwas a grown woman, he was still a boy. He would have to see the world\nbefore he settled in it, and would change his mind about woman half a\nscore of times before he married. Then, too, though she did not like\nthe Lady Arabella, she felt that she owed something, if not to her\nkindness, at least to her forbearance; and she knew, felt inwardly\ncertain, that she would be doing wrong, that the world would say\nshe was doing wrong, that her uncle would think her wrong, if she\nendeavoured to take advantage of what had passed.\n\nShe had not for an instant doubted; not for a moment had she\ncontemplated it as possible that she should ever become Mrs Gresham\nbecause Frank had offered to make her so; but, nevertheless, she\ncould not help thinking of what had occurred--of thinking of it, most\nprobably much more than Frank did himself.\n\nA day or two afterwards, on the evening before Frank's birthday, she\nwas alone with her uncle, walking in the garden behind their house,\nand she then essayed to question him, with the object of learning if\nshe were fitted by her birth to be the wife of such a one as Frank\nGresham. They were in the habit of walking there together when he\nhappened to be at home of a summer's evening. This was not often the\ncase, for his hours of labour extended much beyond those usual to the\nupper working world, the hours, namely, between breakfast and dinner;\nbut those minutes that they did thus pass together, the doctor\nregarded as perhaps the pleasantest of his life.\n\n\"Uncle,\" said she, after a while, \"what do you think of this marriage\nof Miss Gresham's?\"\n\n\"Well, Minnie\"--such was his name of endearment for her--\"I can't say\nI have thought much about it, and I don't suppose anybody else has\neither.\"\n\n\"She must think about it, of course; and so must he, I suppose.\"\n\n\"I'm not so sure of that. Some folks would never get married if they\nhad to trouble themselves with thinking about it.\"\n\n\"I suppose that's why you never got married, uncle?\"\n\n\"Either that, or thinking of it too much. One is as bad as the\nother.\"\n\nMary had not contrived to get at all near her point as yet; so she\nhad to draw off, and after a while begin again.\n\n\"Well, I have been thinking about it, at any rate, uncle.\"\n\n\"That's very good of you; that will save me the trouble; and perhaps\nsave Miss Gresham too. If you have thought it over thoroughly, that\nwill do for all.\"\n\n\"I believe Mr Moffat is a man of no family.\"\n\n\"He'll mend in that point, no doubt, when he has got a wife.\"\n\n\"Uncle, you're a goose; and what is worse, a very provoking goose.\"\n\n\"Niece, you're a gander; and what is worse, a very silly gander. What\nis Mr Moffat's family to you and me? Mr Moffat has that which ranks\nabove family honours. He is a very rich man.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mary, \"I know he is rich; and a rich man I suppose can\nbuy anything--except a woman that is worth having.\"\n\n\"A rich man can buy anything,\" said the doctor; \"not that I meant to\nsay that Mr Moffat has bought Miss Gresham. I have no doubt that they\nwill suit each other very well,\" he added with an air of decisive\nauthority, as though he had finished the subject.\n\nBut his niece was determined not to let him pass so. \"Now, uncle,\"\nsaid she, \"you know you are pretending to a great deal of worldly\nwisdom, which, after all, is not wisdom at all in your eyes.\"\n\n\"Am I?\"\n\n\"You know you are: and as for the impropriety of discussing Miss\nGresham's marriage--\"\n\n\"I did not say it was improper.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, you did; of course such things must be discussed. How is\none to have an opinion if one does not get it by looking at the\nthings which happen around us?\"\n\n\"Now I am going to be blown up,\" said Dr Thorne.\n\n\"Dear uncle, do be serious with me.\"\n\n\"Well, then, seriously, I hope Miss Gresham will be very happy as Mrs\nMoffat.\"\n\n\"Of course you do: so do I. I hope it as much as I can hope what I\ndon't at all see ground for expecting.\"\n\n\"People constantly hope without any such ground.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I'll hope in this case. But, uncle--\"\n\n\"Well, my dear?\"\n\n\"I want your opinion, truly and really. If you were a girl--\"\n\n\"I am perfectly unable to give any opinion founded on so strange an\nhypothesis.\"\n\n\"Well; but if you were a marrying man.\"\n\n\"The hypothesis is quite as much out of my way.\"\n\n\"But, uncle, I am a girl, and perhaps I may marry;--or at any rate\nthink of marrying some day.\"\n\n\"The latter alternative is certainly possible enough.\"\n\n\"Therefore, in seeing a friend taking such a step, I cannot but\nspeculate on the matter as though I were myself in her place. If I\nwere Miss Gresham, should I be right?\"\n\n\"But, Minnie, you are not Miss Gresham.\"\n\n\"No, I am Mary Thorne; it is a very different thing, I know. I\nsuppose _I_ might marry any one without degrading myself.\"\n\nIt was almost ill-natured of her to say this; but she had not meant\nto say it in the sense which the sounds seemed to bear. She had\nfailed in being able to bring her uncle to the point she wished\nby the road she had planned, and in seeking another road, she had\nabruptly fallen into unpleasant places.\n\n\"I should be very sorry that my niece should think so,\" said he; \"and\nam sorry, too, that she should say so. But, Mary, to tell the truth,\nI hardly know at what you are driving. You are, I think, not so clear\nminded--certainly, not so clear worded--as is usual with you.\"\n\n\"I will tell you, uncle;\" and, instead of looking up into his face,\nshe turned her eyes down on the green lawn beneath her feet.\n\n\"Well, Minnie, what is it?\" and he took both her hands in his.\n\n\"I think that Miss Gresham should not marry Mr Moffat. I think so\nbecause her family is high and noble, and because he is low and\nignoble. When one has an opinion on such matters, one cannot but\napply it to things and people around one; and having applied my\nopinion to her, the next step naturally is to apply it to myself.\nWere I Miss Gresham, I would not marry Mr Moffat though he rolled\nin gold. I know where to rank Miss Gresham. What I want to know is,\nwhere I ought to rank myself?\"\n\nThey had been standing when she commenced her last speech; but as\nshe finished it, the doctor moved on again, and she moved with him.\nHe walked on slowly without answering her; and she, out of her full\nmind, pursued aloud the tenor of her thoughts.\n\n\"If a woman feels that she would not lower herself by marrying in\na rank beneath herself, she ought also to feel that she would not\nlower a man that she might love by allowing him to marry into a rank\nbeneath his own--that is, to marry her.\"\n\n\"That does not follow,\" said the doctor quickly. \"A man raises a\nwoman to his own standard, but a woman must take that of the man she\nmarries.\"\n\nAgain they were silent, and again they walked on, Mary holding her\nuncle's arm with both her hands. She was determined, however, to come\nto the point, and after considering for a while how best she might\ndo it, she ceased to beat any longer about the bush, and asked him a\nplain question.\n\n\"The Thornes are as good a family as the Greshams, are they not?\"\n\n\"In absolute genealogy they are, my dear. That is, when I choose to\nbe an old fool and talk of such matters in a sense different from\nthat in which they are spoken of by the world at large, I may say\nthat the Thornes are as good, or perhaps better, than the Greshams,\nbut I should be sorry to say so seriously to any one. The Greshams\nnow stand much higher in the county than the Thornes do.\"\n\n\"But they are of the same class.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes; Wilfred Thorne of Ullathorne, and our friend the squire\nhere, are of the same class.\"\n\n\"But, uncle, I and Augusta Gresham--are we of the same class?\"\n\n\"Well, Minnie, you would hardly have me boast that I am the same\nclass with the squire--I, a poor country doctor?\"\n\n\"You are not answering me fairly, dear uncle; dearest uncle, do you\nnot know that you are not answering me fairly? You know what I mean.\nHave I a right to call the Thornes of Ullathorne my cousins?\"\n\n\"Mary, Mary, Mary!\" said he after a minute's pause, still allowing\nhis arm to hang loose, that she might hold it with both her hands.\n\"Mary, Mary, Mary! I would that you had spared me this!\"\n\n\"I could not have spared it to you for ever, uncle.\"\n\n\"I would that you could have done so; I would that you could!\"\n\n\"It is over now, uncle: it is told now. I will grieve you no more.\nDear, dear, dearest! I should love you more than ever now; I would,\nI would, I would if that were possible. What should I be but for\nyou? What must I have been but for you?\" And she threw herself on\nhis breast, and clinging with her arms round his neck, kissed his\nforehead, cheeks, and lips.\n\nThere was nothing more said then on the subject between them. Mary\nasked no further question, nor did the doctor volunteer further\ninformation. She would have been most anxious to ask about her\nmother's history had she dared to do so; but she did not dare to ask;\nshe could not bear to be told that her mother had been, perhaps was,\na worthless woman. That she was truly a daughter of a brother of the\ndoctor, that she did know. Little as she had heard of her relatives\nin her early youth, few as had been the words which had fallen from\nher uncle in her hearing as to her parentage, she did know this, that\nshe was the daughter of Henry Thorne, a brother of the doctor, and a\nson of the old prebendary. Trifling little things that had occurred,\naccidents which could not be prevented, had told her this; but not\na word had ever passed any one's lips as to her mother. The doctor,\nwhen speaking of his youth, had spoken of her father; but no one had\nspoken of her mother. She had long known that she was the child of a\nThorne; now she knew also that she was no cousin of the Thornes of\nUllathorne; no cousin, at least, in the world's ordinary language, no\nniece indeed of her uncle, unless by his special permission that she\nshould be so.\n\nWhen the interview was over, she went up alone to the drawing-room,\nand there she sat thinking. She had not been there long before her\nuncle came up to her. He did not sit down, or even take off the hat\nwhich he still wore; but coming close to her, and still standing, he\nspoke thus:--\n\n\"Mary, after what has passed I should be very unjust and very cruel\nto you not to tell you one thing more than you have now learned. Your\nmother was unfortunate in much, not in everything; but the world,\nwhich is very often stern in such matters, never judged her to have\ndisgraced herself. I tell you this, my child, in order that you may\nrespect her memory;\" and so saying, he again left her without giving\nher time to speak a word.\n\nWhat he then told her he had told in mercy. He felt what must be her\nfeelings when she reflected that she had to blush for her mother;\nthat not only could she not speak of her mother, but that she might\nhardly think of her with innocence; and to mitigate such sorrow as\nthis, and also to do justice to the woman whom his brother had so\nwronged, he had forced himself to reveal so much as is stated above.\n\nAnd then he walked slowly by himself, backwards and forwards through\nthe garden, thinking of what he had done with reference to this girl,\nand doubting whether he had done wisely and well. He had resolved,\nwhen first the little infant was given over to his charge, that\nnothing should be known of her or by her as to her mother. He was\nwilling to devote himself to this orphan child of his brother, this\nlast seedling of his father's house; but he was not willing so to do\nthis as to bring himself in any manner into familiar contact with the\nScatcherds. He had boasted to himself that he, at any rate, was a\ngentleman; and that she, if she were to live in his house, sit at his\ntable, and share his hearth, must be a lady. He would tell no lie\nabout her; he would not to any one make her out to be aught other or\naught better than she was; people would talk about her of course,\nonly let them not talk to him; he conceived of himself--and the\nconception was not without due ground--that should any do so, he\nhad that within him which would silence them. He would never claim\nfor this little creature--thus brought into the world without a\nlegitimate position in which to stand--he would never claim for her\nany station that would not properly be her own. He would make for her\na station as best he could. As he might sink or swim, so should she.\n\nSo he had resolved; but things had arranged themselves, as they often\ndo, rather than been arranged by him. During ten or twelve years no\none had heard of Mary Thorne; the memory of Henry Thorne and his\ntragic death had passed away; the knowledge that an infant had been\nborn whose birth was connected with that tragedy, a knowledge never\nwidely spread, had faded down into utter ignorance. At the end of\nthese twelve years, Dr Thorne had announced, that a young niece, a\nchild of a brother long since dead, was coming to live with him. As\nhe had contemplated, no one spoke to him; but some people did no\ndoubt talk among themselves. Whether or not the exact truth was\nsurmised by any, it matters not to say; with absolute exactness,\nprobably not; with great approach to it, probably yes. By one person,\nat any rate, no guess whatever was made; no thought relative to Dr\nThorne's niece ever troubled him; no idea that Mary Scatcherd had\nleft a child in England ever occurred to him; and that person was\nRoger Scatcherd, Mary's brother.\n\nTo one friend, and only one, did the doctor tell the whole truth,\nand that was to the old squire. \"I have told you,\" said the doctor,\n\"partly that you may know that the child has no right to mix with\nyour children if you think much of such things. Do you, however, see\nto this. I would rather that no one else should be told.\"\n\nNo one else had been told; and the squire had \"seen to it,\" by\naccustoming himself to look at Mary Thorne running about the house\nwith his own children as though she were of the same brood. Indeed,\nthe squire had always been fond of Mary, had personally noticed her,\nand, in the affair of Mam'selle Larron, had declared that he would\nhave her placed at once on the bench of magistrates;--much to the\ndisgust of the Lady Arabella.\n\nAnd so things had gone on and on, and had not been thought of with\nmuch downright thinking; till now, when she was one-and-twenty\nyears of age, his niece came to him, asking as to her position, and\ninquiring in what rank of life she was to look for a husband.\n\nAnd so the doctor walked backwards and forwards through the garden,\nslowly, thinking now with some earnestness what if, after all, he\nhad been wrong about his niece? What if by endeavouring to place her\nin the position of a lady, he had falsely so placed her, and robbed\nher of all legitimate position? What if there was no rank of life to\nwhich she could now properly attach herself?\n\nAnd then, how had it answered, that plan of his of keeping her all\nto himself? He, Dr Thorne, was still a poor man; the gift of saving\nmoney had not been his; he had ever had a comfortable house for her\nto live in, and, in spite of Doctors Fillgrave, Century, Rerechild,\nand others, had made from his profession an income sufficient for\ntheir joint wants; but he had not done as others do: he had no three\nor four thousand pounds in the Three per Cents. on which Mary might\nlive in some comfort when he should die. Late in life he had insured\nhis life for eight hundred pounds; and to that, and that only, had\nhe to trust for Mary's future maintenance. How had it answered,\nthen, this plan of letting her be unknown to, and undreamed of by,\nthose who were as near to her on her mother's side as he was on the\nfather's? On that side, though there had been utter poverty, there\nwas now absolute wealth.\n\nBut when he took her to himself, had he not rescued her from the very\ndepths of the lowest misery: from the degradation of the workhouse;\nfrom the scorn of honest-born charity-children; from the lowest of\nthe world's low conditions? Was she not now the apple of his eye, his\none great sovereign comfort--his pride, his happiness, his glory?\nWas he to make her over, to make any portion of her over to others,\nif, by doing so, she might be able to share the wealth, as well as\nthe coarse manners and uncouth society of her at present unknown\nconnexions? He, who had never worshipped wealth on his own behalf;\nhe, who had scorned the idol of gold, and had ever been teaching her\nto scorn it; was he now to show that his philosophy had all been\nfalse as soon as the temptation to do so was put in his way?\n\nBut yet, what man would marry this bastard child, without a sixpence,\nand bring not only poverty, but ill blood also on his own children?\nIt might be very well for him, Dr Thorne; for him whose career was\nmade, whose name, at any rate, was his own; for him who had a fixed\nstanding-ground in the world; it might be well for him to indulge in\nlarge views of a philosophy antagonistic to the world's practice; but\nhad he a right to do it for his niece? What man would marry a girl\nso placed? For those among whom she might have legitimately found\na level, education had now utterly unfitted her. And then, he well\nknew that she would never put out her hand in token of love to any\none without telling all she knew and all she surmised as to her own\nbirth.\n\nAnd that question of this evening; had it not been instigated by some\nappeal to her heart? Was there not already within her breast some\ncause for disquietude which had made her so pertinacious? Why else\nhad she told him then, for the first time, that she did not know\nwhere to rank herself? If such an appeal had been made to her, it\nmust have come from young Frank Gresham. What, in such case, would it\nbehove him to do? Should he pack up his all, his lancet-cases, pestle\nand mortar, and seek anew fresh ground in a new world, leaving behind\na huge triumph to those learned enemies of his, Fillgrave, Century,\nand Rerechild? Better that than remain at Greshamsbury at the cost of\nhis child's heart and pride.\n\nAnd so he walked slowly backwards and forwards through his garden,\nmeditating these things painfully enough.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nMatrimonial Prospects\n\n\nIt will of course be remembered that Mary's interview with the other\ngirls at Greshamsbury took place some two or three days subsequently\nto Frank's generous offer of his hand and heart. Mary had quite made\nup her mind that the whole thing was to be regarded as a folly, and\nthat it was not to be spoken of to any one; but yet her heart was\nsore enough. She was full of pride, and yet she knew she must bow her\nneck to the pride of others. Being, as she was herself, nameless, she\ncould not but feel a stern, unflinching antagonism, the antagonism of\na democrat, to the pretensions of others who were blessed with that\nof which she had been deprived. She had this feeling; and yet, of\nall the things that she coveted, she most coveted that, for glorying\nin which, she was determined to heap scorn on others. She said to\nherself, proudly, that God's handiwork was the inner man, the inner\nwoman, the naked creature animated by a living soul; that all other\nadjuncts were but man's clothing for the creature; all others,\nwhether stitched by tailors or contrived by kings. Was it not within\nher capacity to do as nobly, to love as truly, to worship her God in\nheaven with as perfect a faith, and her god on earth with as leal a\ntroth, as though blood had descended to her purely through scores\nof purely born progenitors? So to herself she spoke; and yet, as\nshe said it, she knew that were she a man, such a man as the heir\nof Greshamsbury should be, nothing would tempt her to sully her\nchildren's blood by mating herself with any one that was base born.\nShe felt that were she an Augusta Gresham, no Mr Moffat, let his\nwealth be what it might, should win her hand unless he too could tell\nof family honours and a line of ancestors.\n\nAnd so, with a mind at war with itself, she came forth armed to do\nbattle against the world's prejudices, those prejudices she herself\nloved so well.\n\nAnd was she to give up her old affections, her feminine loves,\nbecause she found that she was a cousin to nobody? Was she no longer\nto pour out her heart to Beatrice Gresham with all the girlish\nvolubility of an equal? Was she to be severed from Patience Oriel,\nand banished--or rather was she to banish herself--from the free\nplace she had maintained in the various youthful female conclaves\nheld within that parish of Greshamsbury?\n\nHitherto, what Mary Thorne would say, what Miss Thorne suggested in\nsuch or such a matter, was quite as frequently asked as any opinion\nfrom Augusta Gresham--quite as frequently, unless when it chanced\nthat any of the de Courcy girls were at the house. Was this to be\ngiven up? These feelings had grown up among them since they were\nchildren, and had not hitherto been questioned among them. Now they\nwere questioned by Mary Thorne. Was she in fact to find that her\nposition had been a false one, and must be changed?\n\nSuch had been her feelings when she protested that she would not be\nAugusta Gresham's bridesmaid, and offered to put her neck beneath\nBeatrice's foot; when she drove the Lady Margaretta out of the room,\nand gave her own opinion as to the proper grammatical construction of\nthe word humble; such also had been her feelings when she kept her\nhand so rigidly to herself while Frank held the dining-room door open\nfor her to pass through.\n\n\"Patience Oriel,\" said she to herself, \"can talk to him of her father\nand mother: let Patience take his hand; let her talk to him;\" and\nthen, not long afterwards, she saw that Patience did talk to him; and\nseeing it, she walked along silent, among some of the old people, and\nwith much effort did prevent a tear from falling down her cheek.\n\nBut why was the tear in her eye? Had she not proudly told Frank that\nhis love-making was nothing but a boy's silly rhapsody? Had she not\nsaid so while she had yet reason to hope that her blood was as good\nas his own? Had she not seen at a glance that his love tirade was\nworthy of ridicule, and of no other notice? And yet there was a tear\nnow in her eye because this boy, whom she had scolded from her, whose\nhand, offered in pure friendship, she had just refused, because he,\nso rebuffed by her, had carried his fun and gallantry to one who\nwould be less cross to him!\n\nShe could hear as she was walking, that while Lady Margaretta was\nwith them, their voices were loud and merry; and her sharp ear could\nalso hear, when Lady Margaretta left them, that Frank's voice became\nlow and tender. So she walked on, saying nothing, looking straight\nbefore her, and by degrees separating herself from all the others.\n\nThe Greshamsbury grounds were on one side somewhat too closely hemmed\nin by the village. On this side was a path running the length of one\nof the streets of the village; and far down the path, near to the\nextremity of the gardens, and near also to a wicket-gate which led\nout into the village, and which could be opened from the inside, was\na seat, under a big yew-tree, from which, through a breach in the\nhouses, might be seen the parish church, standing in the park on the\nother side. Hither Mary walked alone, and here she seated herself,\ndetermined to get rid of her tears and their traces before she again\nshowed herself to the world.\n\n\"I shall never be happy here again,\" said she to herself; \"never. I\nam no longer one of them, and I cannot live among them unless I am\nso.\" And then an idea came across her mind that she hated Patience\nOriel; and then, instantly another idea followed it--quick as such\nthoughts are quick--that she did not hate Patience Oriel at all; that\nshe liked her, nay, loved her; that Patience Oriel was a sweet girl;\nand that she hoped the time would come when she might see her the\nlady of Greshamsbury. And then the tear, which had been no whit\ncontrolled, which indeed had now made itself master of her, came to a\nhead, and, bursting through the floodgates of the eye, came rolling\ndown, and in its fall, wetted her hand as it lay on her lap. \"What a\nfool! what an idiot! what an empty-headed cowardly fool I am!\" said\nshe, springing up from the bench on her feet.\n\nAs she did so, she heard voices close to her, at the little gate.\nThey were those of her uncle and Frank Gresham.\n\n\"God bless you, Frank!\" said the doctor, as he passed out of the\ngrounds. \"You will excuse a lecture, won't you, from so old a\nfriend?--though you are a man now, and discreet, of course, by Act of\nParliament.\"\n\n\"Indeed I will, doctor,\" said Frank. \"I will excuse a longer lecture\nthan that from you.\"\n\n\"At any rate it won't be to-night,\" said the doctor, as he\ndisappeared. \"And if you see Mary, tell her that I am obliged to go;\nand that I will send Janet down to fetch her.\"\n\nNow Janet was the doctor's ancient maid-servant.\n\nMary could not move on without being perceived; she therefore stood\nstill till she heard the click of the door, and then began walking\nrapidly back to the house by the path which had brought her thither.\nThe moment, however, that she did so, she found that she was\nfollowed; and in a very few moments Frank was alongside of her.\n\n\"Oh, Mary!\" said he, calling to her, but not loudly, before he quite\novertook her, \"how odd that I should come across you just when I have\na message for you! and why are you all alone?\"\n\nMary's first impulse was to reiterate her command to him to call her\nno more by her Christian name; but her second impulse told her that\nsuch an injunction at the present moment would not be prudent on her\npart. The traces of her tears were still there; and she well knew\nthat a very little, the slightest show of tenderness on his part, the\nslightest effort on her own to appear indifferent, would bring down\nmore than one other such intruder. It would, moreover, be better\nfor her to drop all outward sign that she remembered what had taken\nplace. So long, then, as he and she were at Greshamsbury together, he\nshould call her Mary if he pleased. He would soon be gone; and while\nhe remained, she would keep out of his way.\n\n\"Your uncle has been obliged to go away to see an old woman at\nSilverbridge.\"\n\n\"At Silverbridge! why, he won't be back all night. Why could not the\nold woman send for Dr Century?\"\n\n\"I suppose she thought two old women could not get on well together.\"\n\nMary could not help smiling. She did not like her uncle going off so\nlate on such a journey; but it was always felt as a triumph when he\nwas invited into the strongholds of his enemies.\n\n\"And Janet is to come over for you. However, I told him it was quite\nunnecessary to disturb another old woman, for that I should of course\nsee you home.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, Mr Gresham; indeed you'll not do that.\"\n\n\"Indeed, and indeed, I shall.\"\n\n\"What! on this great day, when every lady is looking for you, and\ntalking of you. I suppose you want to set the countess against me for\never. Think, too, how angry Lady Arabella will be if you are absent\non such an errand as this.\"\n\n\"To hear you talk, Mary, one would think that you were going to\nSilverbridge yourself.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I am.\"\n\n\"If I did not go with you, some of the other fellows would. John, or\nGeorge--\"\n\n\"Good gracious, Frank! Fancy either of the Mr de Courcys walking home\nwith me!\"\n\nShe had forgotten herself, and the strict propriety on which she had\nresolved, in the impossibility of forgoing her little joke against\nthe de Courcy grandeur; she had forgotten herself, and had called\nhim Frank in her old, former, eager, free tone of voice; and then,\nremembering she had done so, she drew herself up, bit her lips, and\ndetermined to be doubly on her guard in the future.\n\n\"Well, it shall be either one of them or I,\" said Frank: \"perhaps you\nwould prefer my cousin George to me?\"\n\n\"I should prefer Janet to either, seeing that with her I should not\nsuffer the extreme nuisance of knowing that I was a bore.\"\n\n\"A bore! Mary, to me?\"\n\n\"Yes, Mr Gresham, a bore to you. Having to walk home through the mud\nwith village young ladies is boring. All gentlemen feel it to be so.\"\n\n\"There is no mud; if there were you would not be allowed to walk at\nall.\"\n\n\"Oh! village young ladies never care for such things, though\nfashionable gentlemen do.\"\n\n\"I would carry you home, Mary, if it would do you a service,\" said\nFrank, with considerable pathos in his voice.\n\n\"Oh, dear me! pray do not, Mr Gresham. I should not like it at all,\"\nsaid she: \"a wheelbarrow would be preferable to that.\"\n\n\"Of course. Anything would be preferable to my arm, I know.\"\n\n\"Certainly; anything in the way of a conveyance. If I were to act\nbaby; and you were to act nurse, it really would not be comfortable\nfor either of us.\"\n\nFrank Gresham felt disconcerted, though he hardly knew why. He was\nstriving to say something tender to his lady-love; but every word\nthat he spoke she turned into joke. Mary did not answer him coldly\nor unkindly; but, nevertheless, he was displeased. One does not like\nto have one's little offerings of sentimental service turned into\nburlesque when one is in love in earnest. Mary's jokes had appeared\nso easy too; they seemed to come from a heart so little troubled.\nThis, also, was cause of vexation to Frank. If he could but have\nknown all, he would, perhaps, have been better pleased.\n\nHe determined not to be absolutely laughed out of his tenderness.\nWhen, three days ago, he had been repulsed, he had gone away owning\nto himself that he had been beaten; owning so much, but owning it\nwith great sorrow and much shame. Since that he had come of age;\nsince that he had made speeches, and speeches had been made to him;\nsince that he had gained courage by flirting with Patience Oriel. No\nfaint heart ever won a fair lady, as he was well aware; he resolved,\ntherefore, that his heart should not be faint, and that he would see\nwhether the fair lady might not be won by becoming audacity.\n\n\"Mary,\" said he, stopping in the path--for they were now near the\nspot where it broke out upon the lawn, and they could already hear\nthe voices of the guests--\"Mary, you are unkind to me.\"\n\n\"I am not aware of it, Mr Gresham; but if I am, do not you retaliate.\nI am weaker than you, and in your power; do not you, therefore, be\nunkind to me.\"\n\n\"You refused my hand just now,\" continued he. \"Of all the people here\nat Greshamsbury, you are the only one that has not wished me joy; the\nonly one--\"\n\n\"I do wish you joy; I will wish you joy; there is my hand,\" and she\nfrankly put out her ungloved hand. \"You are quite man enough to\nunderstand me: there is my hand; I trust you use it only as it is\nmeant to be used.\"\n\nHe took it in his and pressed it cordially, as he might have done\nthat of any other friend in such a case; and then--did not drop it\nas he should have done. He was not a St Anthony, and it was most\nimprudent in Miss Thorne to subject him to such a temptation.\n\n\"Mary,\" said he; \"dear Mary! dearest Mary! if you did but know how I\nlove you!\"\n\nAs he said this, holding Miss Thorne's hand, he stood on the pathway\nwith his back towards the lawn and house, and, therefore, did not at\nfirst see his sister Augusta, who had just at that moment come upon\nthem. Mary blushed up to her straw hat, and, with a quick jerk,\nrecovered her hand. Augusta saw the motion, and Mary saw that Augusta\nhad seen it.\n\nFrom my tedious way of telling it, the reader will be led to imagine\nthat the hand-squeezing had been protracted to a duration quite\nincompatible with any objection to such an arrangement on the part of\nthe lady; but the fault is mine: in no part hers. Were I possessed\nof a quick spasmodic style of narrative, I should have been able\nto include it all--Frank's misbehaviour, Mary's immediate anger,\nAugusta's arrival, and keen, Argus-eyed inspection, and then Mary's\nsubsequent misery--in five words and half a dozen dashes and inverted\ncommas. The thing should have been so told; for, to do Mary justice,\nshe did not leave her hand in Frank's a moment longer than she could\nhelp herself.\n\nFrank, feeling the hand withdrawn, and hearing, when it was too late,\nthe step on the gravel, turned sharply round. \"Oh, it's you, is it,\nAugusta? Well, what do you want?\"\n\nAugusta was not naturally very ill-natured, seeing that in her veins\nthe high de Courcy blood was somewhat tempered by an admixture of\nthe Gresham attributes; nor was she predisposed to make her brother\nher enemy by publishing to the world any of his little tender\npeccadilloes; but she could not but bethink herself of what her aunt\nhad been saying as to the danger of any such encounters as that she\njust now had beheld; she could not but start at seeing her brother\nthus, on the very brink of the precipice of which the countess had\nspecially forewarned her mother. She, Augusta, was, as she well knew,\ndoing her duty by her family by marrying a tailor's son for whom she\ndid not care a chip, seeing the tailor's son was possessed of untold\nwealth. Now when one member of a household is making a struggle for a\nfamily, it is painful to see the benefit of that struggle negatived\nby the folly of another member. The future Mrs Moffat did feel\naggrieved by the fatuity of the young heir, and, consequently, took\nupon herself to look as much like her Aunt de Courcy as she could do.\n\n\"Well, what is it?\" said Frank, looking rather disgusted. \"What makes\nyou stick your chin up and look in that way?\" Frank had hitherto been\nrather a despot among his sisters, and forgot that the eldest of\nthem was now passing altogether from under his sway to that of the\ntailor's son.\n\n\"Frank,\" said Augusta, in a tone of voice which did honour to the\ngreat lessons she had lately received. \"Aunt de Courcy wants to see\nyou immediately in the small drawing-room;\" and, as she said so, she\nresolved to say a few words of advice to Miss Thorne as soon as her\nbrother should have left them.\n\n\"In the small drawing-room, does she? Well, Mary, we may as well go\ntogether, for I suppose it is tea-time now.\"\n\n\"You had better go at once, Frank,\" said Augusta; \"the countess will\nbe angry if you keep her waiting. She has been expecting you these\ntwenty minutes. Mary Thorne and I can return together.\"\n\nThere was something in the tone in which the words, \"Mary Thorne,\"\nwere uttered, which made Mary at once draw herself up. \"I hope,\" said\nshe, \"that Mary Thorne will never be any hindrance to either of you.\"\n\nFrank's ear had also perceived that there was something in the tone\nof his sister's voice not boding comfort to Mary; he perceived that\nthe de Courcy blood in Augusta's veins was already rebelling against\nthe doctor's niece on his part, though it had condescended to submit\nitself to the tailor's son on her own part.\n\n\"Well, I am going,\" said he; \"but look here Augusta, if you say one\nword of Mary--\"\n\nOh, Frank! Frank! you boy, you very boy! you goose, you silly goose!\nIs that the way you make love, desiring one girl not to tell of\nanother, as though you were three children, tearing your frocks and\ntrousers in getting through the same hedge together? Oh, Frank!\nFrank! you, the full-blown heir of Greshamsbury? You, a man already\nendowed with a man's discretion? You, the forward rider, that did but\nnow threaten young Harry Baker and the Honourable John to eclipse\nthem by prowess in the field? You, of age? Why, thou canst not as yet\nhave left thy mother's apron-string!\n\n\"If you say one word of Mary--\"\n\nSo far had he got in his injunction to his sister, but further than\nthat, in such a case, was he never destined to proceed. Mary's\nindignation flashed upon him, striking him dumb long before the sound\nof her voice reached his ears; and yet she spoke as quick as the\nwords would come to her call, and somewhat loudly too.\n\n\"Say one word of Mary, Mr Gresham! And why should she not say as many\nwords of Mary as she may please? I must tell you all now, Augusta!\nand I must also beg you not to be silent for my sake. As far as I am\nconcerned, tell it to whom you please. This was the second time your\nbrother--\"\n\n\"Mary, Mary,\" said Frank, deprecating her loquacity.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, Mr Gresham; you have made it necessary that I\nshould tell your sister all. He has now twice thought it well to\namuse himself by saying to me words which it was ill-natured in him\nto speak, and--\"\n\n\"Ill-natured, Mary!\"\n\n\"Ill-natured in him to speak,\" continued Mary, \"and to which it would\nbe absurd for me to listen. He probably does the same to others,\" she\nadded, being unable in heart to forget that sharpest of her wounds,\nthat flirtation of his with Patience Oriel; \"but to me it is almost\ncruel. Another girl might laugh at him, or listen to him, as she\nwould choose; but I can do neither. I shall now keep away from\nGreshamsbury, at any rate till he has left it; and, Augusta, I can\nonly beg you to understand, that, as far as I am concerned, there is\nnothing which may not be told to all the world.\"\n\nAnd, so saying, she walked on a little in advance of them, as proud\nas a queen. Had Lady de Courcy herself met her at this moment, she\nwould almost have felt herself forced to shrink out of the pathway.\n\"Not say a word of me!\" she repeated to herself, but still out loud.\n\"No word need be left unsaid on my account; none, none.\"\n\nAugusta followed her, dumfounded at her indignation; and Frank also\nfollowed, but not in silence. When his first surprise at Mary's\ngreat anger was over, he felt himself called upon to say some word\nthat might tend to exonerate his lady-love; and some word also of\nprotestation as to his own purpose.\n\n\"There is nothing to be told, nothing, at least of Mary,\" he said,\nspeaking to his sister; \"but of me, you may tell this, if you choose\nto disoblige your brother--that I love Mary Thorne with all my heart;\nand that I will never love any one else.\"\n\nBy this time they had reached the lawn, and Mary was able to turn\naway from the path which led up to the house. As she left them she\nsaid in a voice, now low enough, \"I cannot prevent him from talking\nnonsense, Augusta; but you will bear me witness, that I do not\nwillingly hear it.\" And, so saying, she started off almost in a run\ntowards the distant part of the gardens, in which she saw Beatrice.\n\nFrank, as he walked up to the house with his sister, endeavoured to\ninduce her to give him a promise that she would tell no tales as to\nwhat she had heard and seen.\n\n\"Of course, Frank, it must be all nonsense,\" she had said; \"and you\nshouldn't amuse yourself in such a way.\"\n\n\"Well, but, Guss, come, we have always been friends; don't let us\nquarrel just when you are going to be married.\" But Augusta would\nmake no promise.\n\nFrank, when he reached the house, found the countess waiting for him,\nsitting in the little drawing-room by herself,--somewhat impatiently.\nAs he entered he became aware that there was some peculiar gravity\nattached to the coming interview. Three persons, his mother, one of\nhis younger sisters, and the Lady Amelia, each stopped him to let\nhim know that the countess was waiting; and he perceived that a\nsort of guard was kept upon the door to save her ladyship from any\nundesirable intrusion.\n\nThe countess frowned at the moment of his entrance, but soon smoothed\nher brow, and invited him to take a chair ready prepared for him\nopposite to the elbow of the sofa on which she was leaning. She had a\nsmall table before her, on which was her teacup, so that she was able\nto preach at him nearly as well as though she had been ensconced in a\npulpit.\n\n\"My dear Frank,\" said she, in a voice thoroughly suitable to the\nimportance of the communication, \"you have to-day come of age.\"\n\nFrank remarked that he understood that such was the case, and added\nthat \"that was the reason for all the fuss.\"\n\n\"Yes; you have to-day come of age. Perhaps I should have been glad to\nsee such an occasion noticed at Greshamsbury with some more suitable\nsigns of rejoicing.\"\n\n\"Oh, aunt! I think we did it all very well.\"\n\n\"Greshamsbury, Frank, is, or at any rate ought to be, the seat of the\nfirst commoner in Barsetshire.\n\n\"Well; so it is. I am quite sure there isn't a better fellow than\nfather anywhere in the county.\"\n\nThe countess sighed. Her opinion of the poor squire was very\ndifferent from Frank's. \"It is no use now,\" said she, \"looking back\nto that which cannot be cured. The first commoner in Barsetshire\nshould hold a position--I will not of course say equal to that of a\npeer.\"\n\n\"Oh dear no; of course not,\" said Frank; and a bystander might have\nthought that there was a touch of satire in his tone.\n\n\"No, not equal to that of a peer; but still of very paramount\nimportance. Of course my first ambition is bound up in Porlock.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Frank, thinking how very weak was the staff on\nwhich his aunt's ambition rested; for Lord Porlock's youthful career\nhad not been such as to give unmitigated satisfaction to his parents.\n\n\"Is bound up in Porlock:\" and then the countess plumed herself; but\nthe mother sighed. \"And next to Porlock, Frank, my anxiety is about\nyou.\"\n\n\"Upon my honour, aunt, I am very much obliged. I shall be all right,\nyou'll see.\"\n\n\"Greshamsbury, my dear boy, is not now what it used to be.\"\n\n\"Isn't it?\" asked Frank.\n\n\"No, Frank; by no means. I do not wish to say a word against your\nfather. It may, perhaps have been his misfortune, rather than his\nfault--\"\n\n\"She is always down on the governor; always,\" said Frank to himself;\nresolving to stick bravely to the side of the house to which he had\nelected to belong.\n\n\"But there is the fact, Frank, too plain to us all; Greshamsbury is\nnot what it was. It is your duty to restore it to its former\nimportance.\"\n\n\"My duty!\" said Frank, rather puzzled.\n\n\"Yes, Frank, your duty. It all depends on you now. Of course you know\nthat your father owes a great deal of money.\"\n\nFrank muttered something. Tidings had in some shape reached his ear\nthat his father was not comfortably circumstances as regarded money.\n\n\"And then, he has sold Boxall Hill. It cannot be expected that Boxall\nHill shall be repurchased, as some horrid man, a railway-maker, I\nbelieve--\"\n\n\"Yes; that's Scatcherd.\"\n\n\"Well, he has built a house there, I'm told; so I presume that it\ncannot be bought back: but it will be your duty, Frank, to pay all\nthe debts that there are on the property, and to purchase what, at\nany rate, will be equal to Boxall Hill.\"\n\nFrank opened his eyes wide and stared at his aunt, as though doubting\nmuch whether or no she were in her right mind. He pay off the\nfamily debts! He buy up property of four thousand pounds a year!\nHe remained, however, quite quiet, waiting the elucidation of the\nmystery.\n\n\"Frank, of course you understand me.\"\n\nFrank was obliged to declare, that just at the present moment he did\nnot find his aunt so clear as usual.\n\n\"You have but one line of conduct left you, Frank: your position,\nas heir to Greshamsbury, is a good one; but your father has\nunfortunately so hampered you with regard to money, that unless you\nset the matter right yourself, you can never enjoy that position. Of\ncourse you must marry money.\"\n\n\"Marry money!\" said he, considering for the first time that in all\nprobability Mary Thorne's fortune would not be extensive. \"Marry\nmoney!\"\n\n\"Yes, Frank. I know no man whose position so imperatively demands it;\nand luckily for you, no man can have more facility for doing so. In\nthe first place you are very handsome.\"\n\nFrank blushed like a girl of sixteen.\n\n\"And then, as the matter is made plain to you at so early an age,\nyou are not of course hampered by any indiscreet tie; by any absurd\nengagement.\"\n\nFrank blushed again; and then saying to himself, \"How much the old\ngirl knows about it!\" felt a little proud of his passion for Mary\nThorne, and of the declaration he had made to her.\n\n\"And your connexion with Courcy Castle,\" continued the countess, now\ncarrying up the list of Frank's advantages to its great climax, \"will\nmake the matter so easy for you, that really, you will hardly have\nany difficulty.\"\n\nFrank could not but say how much obliged he felt to Courcy Castle and\nits inmates.\n\n\"Of course I would not wish to interfere with you in any underhand\nway, Frank; but I will tell you what has occurred to me. You have\nheard, probably, of Miss Dunstable?\"\n\n\"The daughter of the ointment of Lebanon man?\"\n\n\"And of course you know that her fortune is immense,\" continued\nthe countess, not deigning to notice her nephew's allusion to the\nointment. \"Quite immense when compared with the wants and position of\nany commoner. Now she is coming to Courcy Castle, and I wish you to\ncome and meet her.\"\n\n\"But, aunt, just at this moment I have to read for my degree like\nanything. I go up, you know, in October.\"\n\n\"Degree!\" said the countess. \"Why, Frank, I am talking to you of\nyour prospects in life, of your future position, of that on which\neverything hangs, and you tell me of your degree!\"\n\nFrank, however, obstinately persisted that he must take his degree,\nand that he should commence reading hard at six a.m. to-morrow\nmorning.\n\n\"You can read just as well at Courcy Castle. Miss Dunstable will\nnot interfere with that,\" said his aunt, who knew the expediency of\nyielding occasionally; \"but I must beg you will come over and meet\nher. You will find her a most charming young woman, remarkably well\neducated I am told, and--\"\n\n\"How old is she?\" asked Frank.\n\n\"I really cannot say exactly,\" said the countess; \"but it is not, I\nimagine, matter of much moment.\"\n\n\"Is she thirty?\" asked Frank, who looked upon an unmarried woman of\nthat age as quite an old maid.\n\n\"I dare say she may be about that age,\" said the countess, who\nregarded the subject from a very different point of view.\n\n\"Thirty!\" said Frank out loud, but speaking, nevertheless, as though\nto himself.\n\n\"It is a matter of no moment,\" said his aunt, almost angrily. \"When\nthe subject itself is of such vital importance, objections of no\nreal weight should not be brought into view. If you wish to hold up\nyour head in the country; if you wish to represent your county in\nParliament, as has been done by your father, your grandfather, and\nyour great-grandfathers; if you wish to keep a house over your head,\nand to leave Greshamsbury to your son after you, you must marry\nmoney. What does it signify whether Miss Dunstable be twenty-eight\nor thirty? She has got money; and if you marry her, you may then\nconsider that your position in life is made.\"\n\nFrank was astonished at his aunt's eloquence; but, in spite of\nthat eloquence, he made up his mind that he would not marry Miss\nDunstable. How could he, indeed, seeing that his troth was already\nplighted to Mary Thorne in the presence of his sister? This\ncircumstance, however, he did not choose to plead to his aunt, so he\nrecapitulated any other objections that presented themselves to his\nmind.\n\nIn the first place, he was so anxious about his degree that he could\nnot think of marrying at present; then he suggested that it might be\nbetter to postpone the question till the season's hunting should be\nover; he declared that he could not visit Courcy Castle till he got a\nnew suit of clothes home from the tailor; and ultimately remembered\nthat he had a particular engagement to go fly-fishing with Mr Oriel\non that day week.\n\nNone, however, of these valid reasons were sufficiently potent to\nturn the countess from her point.\n\n\"Nonsense, Frank,\" said she, \"I wonder that you can talk of\nfly-fishing when the property of Greshamsbury is at stake. You will\ngo with Augusta and myself to Courcy Castle to-morrow.\"\n\n\"To-morrow, aunt!\" he said, in the tone in which a condemned criminal\nmight make his ejaculation on hearing that a very near day had been\nnamed for his execution. \"To-morrow!\"\n\n\"Yes, we return to-morrow, and shall be happy to have your company.\nMy friends, including Miss Dunstable, come on Thursday. I am quite\nsure you will like Miss Dunstable. I have settled all that with your\nmother, so we need say nothing further about it. And now, good-night,\nFrank.\"\n\nFrank, finding that there was nothing more to be said, took his\ndeparture, and went out to look for Mary. But Mary had gone home with\nJanet half an hour since, so he betook himself to his sister\nBeatrice.\n\n\"Beatrice,\" said he, \"I am to go to Courcy Castle to-morrow.\"\n\n\"So I heard mamma say.\"\n\n\"Well; I only came of age to-day, and I will not begin by running\ncounter to them. But I tell you what, I won't stay above a week\nat Courcy Castle for all the de Courcys in Barsetshire. Tell me,\nBeatrice, did you ever hear of a Miss Dunstable?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nSir Roger Scatcherd\n\n\nEnough has been said in this narrative to explain to the reader that\nRoger Scatcherd, who was whilom a drunken stone-mason in Barchester,\nand who had been so prompt to avenge the injury done to his sister,\nhad become a great man in the world. He had become a contractor,\nfirst for little things, such as half a mile or so of a railway\nembankment, or three or four canal bridges, and then a contractor for\ngreat things, such as Government hospitals, locks, docks, and quays,\nand had latterly had in his hands the making of whole lines of\nrailway.\n\nHe had been occasionally in partnership with one man for one thing,\nand then with another for another; but had, on the whole, kept his\ninterests to himself, and now at the time of our story, he was a very\nrich man.\n\nAnd he had acquired more than wealth. There had been a time when the\nGovernment wanted the immediate performance of some extraordinary\npiece of work, and Roger Scatcherd had been the man to do it. There\nhad been some extremely necessary bit of a railway to be made in half\nthe time that such work would properly demand, some speculation to\nbe incurred requiring great means and courage as well, and Roger\nScatcherd had been found to be the man for the time. He was then\nelevated for the moment to the dizzy pinnacle of a newspaper hero,\nand became one of those \"whom the king delighteth to honour.\" He went\nup one day to kiss Her Majesty's hand, and come down to his new grand\nhouse at Boxall Hill, Sir Roger Scatcherd, Bart.\n\n\"And now, my lady,\" said he, when he explained to his wife the high\nstate to which she had been called by his exertions and the Queen's\nprerogative, \"let's have a bit of dinner, and a drop of som'at hot.\"\nNow the drop of som'at hot signified a dose of alcohol sufficient to\nsend three ordinary men very drunk to bed.\n\nWhile conquering the world Roger Scatcherd had not conquered his old\nbad habits. Indeed, he was the same man at all points that he had\nbeen when formerly seen about the streets of Barchester with his\nstone-mason's apron tucked up round his waist. The apron he had\nabandoned, but not the heavy prominent thoughtful brow, with the\nwildly flashing eye beneath it. He was still the same good companion,\nand still also the same hard-working hero. In this only had he\nchanged, that now he would work, and some said equally well, whether\nhe were drunk or sober. Those who were mostly inclined to make a\nmiracle of him--and there was a school of worshippers ready to adore\nhim as their idea of a divine, superhuman, miracle-moving, inspired\nprophet--declared that his wondrous work was best done, his\ncalculations most quickly and most truly made, that he saw with most\naccurate eye into the far-distant balance of profit and loss, when\nhe was under the influence of the rosy god. To these worshippers his\nbreakings-out, as his periods of intemperance were called in his own\nset, were his moments of peculiar inspiration--his divine frenzies,\nin which he communicated most closely with those deities who preside\nover trade transactions; his Eleusinian mysteries, to approach him in\nwhich was permitted only to a few of the most favoured.\n\n\"Scatcherd has been drunk this week past,\" they would say one to\nanother, when the moment came at which it was to be decided whose\noffer should be accepted for constructing a harbour to hold all the\ncommerce of Lancashire, or to make a railway from Bombay to Canton.\n\"Scatcherd has been drunk this week past; I am told that he has taken\nover three gallons of brandy.\" And then they felt sure that none but\nScatcherd would be called upon to construct the dock or make the\nrailway.\n\nBut be this as it may, be it true or false that Sir Roger was most\nefficacious when in his cups, there can be no doubt that he could not\nwallow for a week in brandy, six or seven times every year, without\nin a great measure injuring, and permanently injuring, the outward\nman. Whatever immediate effect such symposiums might have on the\ninner mind--symposiums indeed they were not; posiums I will call\nthem, if I may be allowed; for in latter life, when he drank heavily,\nhe drank alone--however little for evil, or however much for good the\nworking of his brain might be affected, his body suffered greatly. It\nwas not that he became feeble or emaciated, old-looking or inactive,\nthat his hand shook, or that his eye was watery; but that in the\nmoments of his intemperance his life was often not worth a day's\npurchase. The frame which God had given to him was powerful beyond\nthe power of ordinary men; powerful to act in spite of these violent\nperturbations; powerful to repress and conquer the qualms and\nheadaches and inward sicknesses to which the votaries of Bacchus are\nordinarily subject; but this power was not without its limit. If\nencroached on too far, it would break and fall and come asunder, and\nthen the strong man would at once become a corpse.\n\nScatcherd had but one friend in the world. And, indeed, this friend\nwas no friend in the ordinary acceptance of the word. He neither ate\nwith him nor drank with him, nor even frequently talked with him.\nTheir pursuits in life were wide asunder. Their tastes were all\ndifferent. The society in which each moved very seldom came together.\nScatcherd had nothing in unison with this solitary friend; but he\ntrusted him, and he trusted no other living creature on God's earth.\n\nHe trusted this man; but even him he did not trust thoroughly; not at\nleast as one friend should trust another. He believed that this man\nwould not rob him; would probably not lie to him; would not endeavour\nto make money of him; would not count him up or speculate on him, and\nmake out a balance of profit and loss; and, therefore, he determined\nto use him. But he put no trust whatever in his friend's counsel, in\nhis modes of thought; none in his theory, and none in his practice.\nHe disliked his friend's counsel, and, in fact, disliked his\nsociety, for his friend was somewhat apt to speak to him in a manner\napproaching to severity. Now Roger Scatcherd had done many things\nin the world, and made much money; whereas his friend had done but\nfew things, and made no money. It was not to be endured that the\npractical, efficient man should be taken to task by the man who\nproved himself to be neither practical nor efficient; not to be\nendured, certainly, by Roger Scatcherd, who looked on men of his own\nclass as the men of the day, and on himself as by no means the least\namong them.\n\nThe friend was our friend Dr Thorne.\n\nThe doctor's first acquaintance with Scatcherd has been already\nexplained. He was necessarily thrown into communication with the man\nat the time of the trial, and Scatcherd then had not only sufficient\nsense, but sufficient feeling also to know that the doctor behaved\nvery well. This communication had in different ways been kept up\nbetween them. Soon after the trial Scatcherd had begun to rise, and\nhis first savings had been entrusted to the doctor's care. This had\nbeen the beginning of a pecuniary connexion which had never wholly\nceased, and which had led to the purchase of Boxall Hill, and to the\nloan of large sums of money to the squire.\n\nIn another way also there had been a close alliance between them, and\none not always of a very pleasant description. The doctor was, and\nlong had been, Sir Roger's medical attendant, and, in his unceasing\nattempts to rescue the drunkard from the fate which was so much to\nbe dreaded, he not unfrequently was driven into a quarrel with his\npatient.\n\nOne thing further must be told of Sir Roger. In politics he was as\nviolent a Radical as ever, and was very anxious to obtain a position\nin which he could bring his violence to bear. With this view he was\nabout to contest his native borough of Barchester, in the hope of\nbeing returned in opposition to the de Courcy candidate; and with\nthis object he had now come down to Boxall Hill.\n\nNor were his claims to sit for Barchester such as could be despised.\nIf money were to be of avail, he had plenty of it, and was prepared\nto spend it; whereas, rumour said that Mr Moffat was equally\ndetermined to do nothing so foolish. Then again, Sir Roger had a sort\nof rough eloquence, and was able to address the men of Barchester in\nlanguage that would come home to their hearts, in words that would\nendear him to one party while they made him offensively odious to the\nother; but Mr Moffat could make neither friends nor enemies by his\neloquence. The Barchester roughs called him a dumb dog that could not\nbark, and sometimes sarcastically added that neither could he bite.\nThe de Courcy interest, however, was at his back, and he had also the\nadvantage of possession. Sir Roger, therefore, knew that the battle\nwas not to be won without a struggle.\n\nDr Thorne got safely back from Silverbridge that evening, and found\nMary waiting to give him his tea. He had been called there to a\nconsultation with Dr Century, that amiable old gentleman having so\nfar fallen away from the high Fillgrave tenets as to consent to the\noccasional endurance of such degradation.\n\nThe next morning he breakfasted early, and, having mounted his strong\niron-grey cob, started for Boxall Hill. Not only had he there to\nnegotiate the squire's further loan, but also to exercise his medical\nskill. Sir Roger having been declared contractor for cutting a canal\nfrom sea to sea, through the Isthmus of Panama, had been making a\nweek of it; and the result was that Lady Scatcherd had written rather\nperemptorily to her husband's medical friend.\n\nThe doctor consequently trotted off to Boxall Hill on his iron-grey\ncob. Among his other merits was that of being a good horseman, and\nhe did much of his work on horseback. The fact that he occasionally\ntook a day with the East Barsetshires, and that when he did so he\nthoroughly enjoyed it, had probably not failed to add something to\nthe strength of the squire's friendship.\n\n\"Well, my lady, how is he? Not much the matter, I hope?\" said the\ndoctor, as he shook hands with the titled mistress of Boxall Hill in\na small breakfast-parlour in the rear of the house. The show-rooms\nof Boxall Hill were furnished most magnificently, but they were set\napart for company; and as the company never came--seeing that they\nwere never invited--the grand rooms and the grand furniture were not\nof much material use to Lady Scatcherd.\n\n\"Indeed then, doctor, he's just bad enough,\" said her ladyship, not\nin a very happy tone of voice; \"just bad enough. There's been some'at\nat the back of his head, rapping, and rapping, and rapping; and if\nyou don't do something, I'm thinking it will rap him too hard yet.\"\n\n\"Is he in bed?\"\n\n\"Why, yes, he is in bed; for when he was first took he couldn't very\nwell help hisself, so we put him to bed. And then, he don't seem to\nbe quite right yet about the legs, so he hasn't got up; but he's got\nthat Winterbones with him to write for him, and when Winterbones is\nthere, Scatcherd might as well be up for any good that bed'll do\nhim.\"\n\nMr Winterbones was confidential clerk to Sir Roger. That is to say,\nhe was a writing-machine of which Sir Roger made use to do certain\nwork which could not well be adjusted without some contrivance. He\nwas a little, withered, dissipated, broken-down man, whom gin and\npoverty had nearly burnt to a cinder, and dried to an ash. Mind he\nhad none left, nor care for earthly things, except the smallest\nmodicum of substantial food, and the largest allowance of liquid\nsustenance. All that he had ever known he had forgotten, except how\nto count up figures and to write: the results of his counting and his\nwriting never stayed with him from one hour to another; nay, not from\none folio to another. Let him, however, be adequately screwed up with\ngin, and adequately screwed down by the presence of his master, and\nthen no amount of counting and writing would be too much for him.\nThis was Mr Winterbones, confidential clerk to the great Sir Roger\nScatcherd.\n\n\"We must send Winterbones away, I take it,\" said the doctor.\n\n\"Indeed, doctor, I wish you would. I wish you'd send him to Bath, or\nanywhere else out of the way. There is Scatcherd, he takes brandy;\nand there is Winterbones, he takes gin; and it'd puzzle a woman to\nsay which is worst, master or man.\"\n\nIt will seem from this, that Lady Scatcherd and the doctor were on\nvery familiar terms as regarded her little domestic inconveniences.\n\n\"Tell Sir Roger I am here, will you?\" said the doctor.\n\n\"You'll take a drop of sherry before you go up?\" said the lady.\n\n\"Not a drop, thank you,\" said the doctor.\n\n\"Or, perhaps, a little cordial?\"\n\n\"Not a drop of anything, thank you; I never do, you know.\"\n\n\"Just a thimbleful of this?\" said the lady, producing from some\nrecess under a sideboard a bottle of brandy; \"just a thimbleful? It's\nwhat he takes himself.\"\n\nWhen Lady Scatcherd found that even this argument failed, she led the\nway to the great man's bedroom.\n\n\"Well, doctor! well, doctor! well, doctor!\" was the greeting with\nwhich our son of Galen was saluted some time before he entered the\nsick-room. His approaching step was heard, and thus the ci-devant\nBarchester stone-mason saluted his coming friend. The voice was loud\nand powerful, but not clear and sonorous. What voice that is nurtured\non brandy can ever be clear? It had about it a peculiar huskiness, a\ndissipated guttural tone, which Thorne immediately recognised, and\nrecognised as being more marked, more guttural, and more husky than\nheretofore.\n\n\"So you've smelt me out, have you, and come for your fee? Ha! ha!\nha! Well, I have had a sharpish bout of it, as her ladyship there\nno doubt has told you. Let her alone to make the worst of it. But,\nyou see, you're too late, man. I've bilked the old gentleman again\nwithout troubling you.\"\n\n\"Anyway, I'm glad you're something better, Scatcherd.\"\n\n\"Something! I don't know what you call something. I never was better\nin my life. Ask Winterbones there.\"\n\n\"Indeed, now, Scatcherd, you ain't; you're bad enough if you only\nknew it. And as for Winterbones, he has no business here up in your\nbedroom, which stinks of gin so, it does. Don't you believe him,\ndoctor; he ain't well, nor yet nigh well.\"\n\nWinterbones, when the above ill-natured allusion was made to\nthe aroma coming from his libations, might be seen to deposit\nsurreptitiously beneath the little table at which he sat, the cup\nwith which he had performed them.\n\nThe doctor, in the meantime, had taken Sir Roger's hand on the\npretext of feeling his pulse, but was drawing quite as much\ninformation from the touch of the sick man's skin, and the look of\nthe sick man's eye.\n\n\"I think Mr Winterbones had better go back to the London office,\"\nsaid he. \"Lady Scatcherd will be your best clerk for some time, Sir\nRoger.\"\n\n\"Then I'll be d---- if Mr Winterbones does anything of the kind,\"\nsaid he; \"so there's an end of that.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said the doctor. \"A man can die but once. It is my duty\nto suggest measures for putting off the ceremony as long as possible.\nPerhaps, however, you may wish to hasten it.\"\n\n\"Well, I am not very anxious about it, one way or the other,\" said\nScatcherd. And as he spoke there came a fierce gleam from his eye,\nwhich seemed to say--\"If that's the bugbear with which you wish to\nfrighten me, you will find that you are mistaken.\"\n\n\"Now, doctor, don't let him talk that way, don't,\" said Lady\nScatcherd, with her handkerchief to her eyes.\n\n\"Now, my lady, do you cut it; cut at once,\" said Sir Roger, turning\nhastily round to his better-half; and his better-half, knowing that\nthe province of a woman is to obey, did cut it. But as she went she\ngave the doctor a pull by the coat's sleeve, so that thereby his\nhealing faculties might be sharpened to the very utmost.\n\n\"The best woman in the world, doctor; the very best,\" said he, as the\ndoor closed behind the wife of his bosom.\n\n\"I'm sure of it,\" said the doctor.\n\n\"Yes, till you find a better one,\" said Scatcherd. \"Ha! ha! ha! but\ngood or bad, there are some things which a woman can't understand,\nand some things which she ought not to be let to understand.\"\n\n\"It's natural she should be anxious about your health, you know.\"\n\n\"I don't know that,\" said the contractor. \"She'll be very well off.\nAll that whining won't keep a man alive, at any rate.\"\n\nThere was a pause, during which the doctor continued his medical\nexamination. To this the patient submitted with a bad grace; but\nstill he did submit.\n\n\"We must turn over a new leaf, Sir Roger; indeed we must.\"\n\n\"Bother,\" said Sir Roger.\n\n\"Well, Scatcherd; I must do my duty to you, whether you like it or\nnot.\"\n\n\"That is to say, I am to pay you for trying to frighten me.\"\n\n\"No human nature can stand such shocks as these much longer.\"\n\n\"Winterbones,\" said the contractor, turning to his clerk, \"go down,\ngo down, I say; but don't be out of the way. If you go to the\npublic-house, by G----, you may stay there for me. When I take a\ndrop,--that is if I ever do, it does not stand in the way of work.\"\nSo Mr Winterbones, picking up his cup again, and concealing it in\nsome way beneath his coat flap, retreated out of the room, and the\ntwo friends were alone.\n\n\"Scatcherd,\" said the doctor, \"you have been as near your God, as any\nman ever was who afterwards ate and drank in this world.\"\n\n\"Have I, now?\" said the railway hero, apparently somewhat startled.\n\n\"Indeed you have; indeed you have.\"\n\n\"And now I'm all right again?\"\n\n\"All right! How can you be all right, when you know that your limbs\nrefuse to carry you? All right! why the blood is still beating round\nyour brain with a violence that would destroy any other brain but\nyours.\"\n\n\"Ha! ha! ha!\" laughed Scatcherd. He was very proud of thinking\nhimself to be differently organised from other men. \"Ha! ha! ha!\nWell, and what am I to do now?\"\n\nThe whole of the doctor's prescription we will not give at length.\nTo some of his ordinances Sir Roger promised obedience; to others he\nobjected violently, and to one or two he flatly refused to listen.\nThe great stumbling-block was this, that total abstinence from\nbusiness for two weeks was enjoined; and that it was impossible, so\nSir Roger said, that he should abstain for two days.\n\n\"If you work,\" said the doctor, \"in your present state, you will\ncertainly have recourse to the stimulus of drink; and if you drink,\nmost assuredly you will die.\"\n\n\"Stimulus! Why do you think I can't work without Dutch courage?\"\n\n\"Scatcherd, I know that there is brandy in the room at this moment,\nand that you have been taking it within these two hours.\"\n\n\"You smell that fellow's gin,\" said Scatcherd.\n\n\"I feel the alcohol working within your veins,\" said the doctor, who\nstill had his hand on his patient's arm.\n\nSir Roger turned himself roughly in the bed so as to get away from\nhis Mentor, and then he began to threaten in his turn.\n\n\"I'll tell you what it is, doctor; I've made up my mind, and I'll do\nit. I'll send for Fillgrave.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said he of Greshamsbury, \"send for Fillgrave. Your case\nis one in which even he can hardly go wrong.\"\n\n\"You think you can hector me, and do as you like because you had me\nunder your thumb in other days. You're a very good fellow, Thorne,\nbut I ain't sure that you are the best doctor in all England.\"\n\n\"You may be sure I am not; you may take me for the worst if you will.\nBut while I am here as your medical adviser, I can only tell you the\ntruth to the best of my thinking. Now the truth is this, that another\nbout of drinking will in all probability kill you; and any recourse\nto stimulus in your present condition may do so.\"\n\n\"I'll send for Fillgrave--\"\n\n\"Well, send for Fillgrave, only do it at once. Believe me at any\nrate in this, that whatever you do, you should do at once. Oblige\nme in this; let Lady Scatcherd take away that brandy bottle till Dr\nFillgrave comes.\"\n\n\"I'm d---- if I do. Do you think I can't have a bottle of brandy in\nmy room without swigging?\"\n\n\"I think you'll be less likely to swig it if you can't get at it.\"\n\nSir Roger made another angry turn in his bed as well as his\nhalf-paralysed limbs would let him; and then, after a few moments'\npeace, renewed his threats with increased violence.\n\n\"Yes; I'll have Fillgrave over here. If a man be ill, really ill,\nhe should have the best advice he can get. I'll have Fillgrave, and\nI'll have that other fellow from Silverbridge to meet him. What's his\nname?--Century.\"\n\nThe doctor turned his head away; for though the occasion was serious,\nhe could not help smiling at the malicious vengeance with which his\nfriend proposed to gratify himself.\n\n\"I will; and Rerechild too. What's the expense? I suppose five or six\npound apiece will do it; eh, Thorne?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; that will be liberal I should say. But, Sir Roger, will you\nallow me to suggest what you ought to do? I don't know how far you\nmay be joking--\"\n\n\"Joking!\" shouted the baronet; \"you tell a man he's dying and joking\nin the same breath. You'll find I'm not joking.\"\n\n\"Well I dare say not. But if you have not full confidence in me--\"\n\n\"I have no confidence in you at all.\"\n\n\"Then why not send to London? Expense is no object to you.\"\n\n\"It is an object; a great object.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! Send to London for Sir Omicron Pie: send for some man whom\nyou will really trust when you see him.\n\n\"There's not one of the lot I'd trust as soon as Fillgrave. I've\nknown Fillgrave all my life, and I trust him. I'll send for Fillgrave\nand put my case in his hands. If any one can do anything for me,\nFillgrave is the man.\"\n\n\"Then in God's name send for Fillgrave,\" said the doctor. \"And now,\ngood-bye, Scatcherd; and as you do send for him, give him a fair\nchance. Do not destroy yourself by more brandy before he comes.\"\n\n\"That's my affair, and his; not yours,\" said the patient.\n\n\"So be it; give me your hand, at any rate, before I go. I wish you\nwell through it, and when you are well, I'll come and see you.\"\n\n\"Good-bye--good-bye; and look here, Thorne, you'll be talking to Lady\nScatcherd downstairs I know; now, no nonsense. You understand me, eh?\nno nonsense, you know.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nSir Roger's Will\n\n\nDr Thorne left the room and went downstairs, being fully aware that\nhe could not leave the house without having some communication with\nLady Scatcherd. He was not sooner within the passage than he heard\nthe sick man's bell ring violently; and then the servant, passing\nhim on the staircase, received orders to send a mounted messenger\nimmediately to Barchester. Dr Fillgrave was to be summoned to come as\nquickly as possible to the sick man's room, and Mr Winterbones was to\nbe sent up to write the note.\n\nSir Roger was quite right in supposing that there would be some words\nbetween the doctor and her ladyship. How, indeed, was the doctor to\nget out of the house without such, let him wish it ever so much?\nThere were words; and these were protracted, while the doctor's\ncob was being ordered round, till very many were uttered which the\ncontractor would probably have regarded as nonsense.\n\nLady Scatcherd was no fit associate for the wives of English\nbaronets;--was no doubt by education and manners much better fitted\nto sit in their servants' halls; but not on that account was she a\nbad wife or a bad woman. She was painfully, fearfully, anxious for\nthat husband of hers, whom she honoured and worshipped, as it behoved\nher to do, above all other men. She was fearfully anxious as to his\nlife, and faithfully believed, that if any man could prolong it, it\nwas that old and faithful friend whom she had known to be true to her\nlord since their early married troubles.\n\nWhen, therefore, she found that he had been dismissed, and that a\nstranger was to be sent for in his place, her heart sank low within\nher.\n\n\"But, doctor,\" she said, with her apron up to her eyes, \"you ain't\ngoing to leave him, are you?\"\n\nDr Thorne did not find it easy to explain to her ladyship that\nmedical etiquette would not permit him to remain in attendance on her\nhusband after he had been dismissed and another physician called in\nhis place.\n\n\"Etiquette!\" said she, crying. \"What's etiquette to do with it when a\nman is a-killing hisself with brandy?\"\n\n\"Fillgrave will forbid that quite as strongly as I can do.\"\n\n\"Fillgrave!\" said she. \"Fiddlesticks! Fillgrave, indeed!\"\n\nDr Thorne could almost have embraced her for the strong feeling of\nthorough confidence on the one side, and thorough distrust on the\nother, which she contrived to throw into those few words.\n\n\"I'll tell you what, doctor; I won't let the messenger go. I'll bear\nthe brunt of it. He can't do much now he ain't up, you know. I'll\nstop the boy; we won't have no Fillgraves here.\"\n\nThis, however, was a step to which Dr Thorne would not assent. He\nendeavoured to explain to the anxious wife, that after what had\npassed he could not tender his medical services till they were again\nasked for.\n\n\"But you can slip in as a friend, you know; and then by degrees you\ncan come round him, eh? can't you now, doctor? And as to the\npayment--\"\n\nAll that Dr Thorne said on the subject may easily be imagined. And in\nthis way, and in partaking of the lunch which was forced upon him, an\nhour had nearly passed between his leaving Sir Roger's bedroom and\nputting his foot in the stirrup. But no sooner had the cob begun to\nmove on the gravel-sweep before the house, than one of the upper\nwindows opened, and the doctor was summoned to another conference\nwith the sick man.\n\n\"He says you are to come back, whether or no,\" said Mr Winterbones,\nscreeching out of the window, and putting all his emphasis on the\nlast words.\n\n\"Thorne! Thorne! Thorne!\" shouted the sick man from his sick-bed, so\nloudly that the doctor heard him, seated as he was on horseback out\nbefore the house.\n\n\"You're to come back, whether or no,\" repeated Winterbones, with\nmore emphasis, evidently conceiving that there was a strength of\ninjunction in that \"whether or no\" which would be found quite\ninvincible.\n\nWhether actuated by these magic words, or by some internal process of\nthought, we will not say; but the doctor did slowly, and as though\nunwillingly, dismount again from his steed, and slowly retrace his\nsteps into the house.\n\n\"It is no use,\" he said to himself, \"for that messenger has already\ngone to Barchester.\"\n\n\"I have sent for Dr Fillgrave,\" were the first words which the\ncontractor said to him when he again found himself by the bedside.\n\n\"Did you call me back to tell me that?\" said Thorne, who now realy\nfelt angry at the impertinent petulance of the man before him: \"you\nshould consider, Scatcherd, that my time may be of value to others,\nif not to you.\"\n\n\"Now don't be angry, old fellow,\" said Scatcherd, turning to him,\nand looking at him with a countenance quite different from any that\nhe had shown that day; a countenance in which there was a show of\nmanhood,--some show also of affection. \"You ain't angry now because\nI've sent for Fillgrave?\"\n\n\"Not in the least,\" said the doctor very complacently. \"Not in the\nleast. Fillgrave will do as much good as I can do you.\"\n\n\"And that's none at all, I suppose; eh, Thorne?\"\n\n\"That depends on yourself. He will do you good if you will tell him\nthe truth, and will then be guided by him. Your wife, your servant,\nany one can be as good a doctor to you as either he or I; as good,\nthat is, in the main point. But you have sent for Fillgrave now; and\nof course you must see him. I have much to do, and you must let me\ngo.\"\n\nScatcherd, however, would not let him go, but held his hand fast.\n\"Thorne,\" said he, \"if you like it, I'll make them put Fillgrave\nunder the pump directly he comes here. I will indeed, and pay all the\ndamage myself.\"\n\nThis was another proposition to which the doctor could not consent;\nbut he was utterly unable to refrain from laughing. There was an\nearnest look of entreaty about Sir Roger's face as he made the\nsuggestion; and, joined to this, there was a gleam of comic\nsatisfaction in his eye which seemed to promise, that if he received\nthe least encouragement he would put his threat into execution. Now\nour doctor was not inclined to taking any steps towards subjecting\nhis learned brother to pump discipline; but he could not but admit to\nhimself that the idea was not a bad one.\n\n\"I'll have it done, I will, by heavens! if you'll only say the word,\"\nprotested Sir Roger.\n\nBut the doctor did not say the word, and so the idea was passed off.\n\n\"You shouldn't be so testy with a man when he is ill,\" said\nScatcherd, still holding the doctor's hand, of which he had again got\npossession; \"specially not an old friend; and specially again when\nyou're been a-blowing of him up.\"\n\nIt was not worth the doctor's while to aver that the testiness\nhad all been on the other side, and that he had never lost his\ngood-humour; so he merely smiled, and asked Sir Roger if he could do\nanything further for him.\n\n\"Indeed you can, doctor; and that's why I sent for you,--why I sent\nfor you yesterday. Get out of the room, Winterbones,\" he then said,\ngruffly, as though he were dismissing from his chamber a dirty\ndog. Winterbones, not a whit offended, again hid his cup under his\ncoat-tail and vanished.\n\n\"Sit down, Thorne, sit down,\" said the contractor, speaking quite in\na different manner from any that he had yet assumed. \"I know you're\nin a hurry, but you must give me half an hour. I may be dead before\nyou can give me another; who knows?\"\n\nThe doctor of course declared that he hoped to have many a\nhalf-hour's chat with him for many a year to come.\n\n\"Well, that's as may be. You must stop now, at any rate. You can make\nthe cob pay for it, you know.\"\n\nThe doctor took a chair and sat down. Thus entreated to stop, he had\nhardly any alternative but to do so.\n\n\"It wasn't because I'm ill that I sent for you, or rather let her\nladyship send for you. Lord bless you, Thorne; do you think I don't\nknow what it is that makes me like this? When I see that poor wretch,\nWinterbones, killing himself with gin, do you think I don't know\nwhat's coming to myself as well as him?\n\n\"Why do you take it then? Why do you do it? Your life is not like\nhis. Oh, Scatcherd! Scatcherd!\" and the doctor prepared to pour out\nthe flood of his eloquence in beseeching this singular man to abstain\nfrom his well-known poison.\n\n\"Is that all you know of human nature, doctor? Abstain. Can you\nabstain from breathing, and live like a fish does under water?\"\n\n\"But Nature has not ordered you to drink, Scatcherd.\"\n\n\"Habit is second nature, man; and a stronger nature than the first.\nAnd why should I not drink? What else has the world given me for\nall that I have done for it? What other resource have I? What other\ngratification?\"\n\n\"Oh, my God! Have you not unbounded wealth? Can you not do anything\nyou wish? be anything you choose?\"\n\n\"No,\" and the sick man shrieked with an energy that made him audible\nall through the house. \"I can do nothing that I would choose to do;\nbe nothing that I would wish to be! What can I do? What can I be?\nWhat gratification can I have except the brandy bottle? If I go among\ngentlemen, can I talk to them? If they have anything to say about\na railway, they will ask me a question: if they speak to me beyond\nthat, I must be dumb. If I go among my workmen, can they talk to me?\nNo; I am their master, and a stern master. They bob their heads and\nshake in their shoes when they see me. Where are my friends? Here!\"\nsaid he, and he dragged a bottle from under his very pillow. \"Where\nare my amusements? Here!\" and he brandished the bottle almost in the\ndoctor's face. \"Where is my one resource, my one gratification, my\nonly comfort after all my toils. Here, doctor; here, here, here!\"\nand, so saying, he replaced his treasure beneath his pillow.\n\nThere was something so horrifying in this, that Dr Thorne shrank back\namazed, and was for a moment unable to speak.\n\n\"But, Scatcherd,\" he said at last; \"surely you would not die for such\na passion as that?\"\n\n\"Die for it? Aye, would I. Live for it while I can live; and die for\nit when I can live no longer. Die for it! What is that for a man to\ndo? Do not men die for a shilling a day? What is a man the worse for\ndying? What can I be the worse for dying? A man can die but once, you\nsaid just now. I'd die ten times for this.\"\n\n\"You are speaking now either in madness, or else in folly, to startle\nme.\"\n\n\"Folly enough, perhaps, and madness enough, also. Such a life as mine\nmakes a man a fool, and makes him mad too. What have I about me that\nI should be afraid to die? I'm worth three hundred thousand pounds;\nand I'd give it all to be able to go to work to-morrow with a hod and\nmortar, and have a fellow clap his hand upon my shoulder, and say:\n'Well, Roger, shall us have that 'ere other half-pint this morning?'\nI'll tell you what, Thorne, when a man has made three hundred\nthousand pounds, there's nothing left for him but to die. It's all\nhe's good for then. When money's been made, the next thing is to\nspend it. Now the man who makes it has not the heart to do that.\"\n\nThe doctor, of course, in hearing all this, said something of a\ntendency to comfort and console the mind of his patient. Not that\nanything he could say would comfort or console the man; but that it\nwas impossible to sit there and hear such fearful truths--for as\nregarded Scatcherd they were truths--without making some answer.\n\n\"This is as good as a play, isn't, doctor?\" said the baronet. \"You\ndidn't know how I could come out like one of those actor fellows.\nWell, now, come; at last I'll tell you why I have sent for you.\nBefore that last burst of mine I made my will.\"\n\n\"You had a will made before that.\"\n\n\"Yes, I had. That will is destroyed. I burnt it with my own hand, so\nthat there should be no mistake about it. In that will I had named\ntwo executors, you and Jackson. I was then partner with Jackson in\nthe York and Yeovil Grand Central. I thought a deal of Jackson then.\nHe's not worth a shilling now.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm exactly in the same category.\"\n\n\"No, you're not. Jackson is nothing without money; but money'll never\nmake you.\"\n\n\"No, nor I shan't make money,\" said the doctor.\n\n\"No, you never will. Nevertheless, there's my other will, there,\nunder that desk there; and I've put you in as sole executor.\"\n\n\"You must alter that, Scatcherd; you must indeed; with three hundred\nthousand pounds to be disposed of, the trust is far too much for any\none man: besides you must name a younger man; you and I are of the\nsame age, and I may die the first.\"\n\n\"Now, doctor, doctor, no humbug; let's have no humbug from you.\nRemember this; if you're not true, you're nothing.\"\n\n\"Well, but, Scatcherd--\"\n\n\"Well, but doctor, there's the will, it's already made. I don't want\nto consult you about that. You are named as executor, and if you have\nthe heart to refuse to act when I'm dead, why, of course, you can do\nso.\"\n\nThe doctor was no lawyer, and hardly knew whether he had any means\nof extricating himself from this position in which his friend was\ndetermined to place him.\n\n\"You'll have to see that will carried out, Thorne. Now I'll tell you\nwhat I have done.\"\n\n\"You're not going to tell me how you have disposed of your property?\"\n\n\"Not exactly; at least not all of it. One hundred thousand I've left\nin legacies, including, you know, what Lady Scatcherd will have.\"\n\n\"Have you not left the house to Lady Scatcherd?\"\n\n\"No; what the devil would she do with a house like this? She doesn't\nknow how to live in it now she has got it. I have provided for her;\nit matters not how. The house and the estate, and the remainder of my\nmoney, I have left to Louis Philippe.\"\n\n\"What! two hundred thousand pounds?\" said the doctor.\n\n\"And why shouldn't I leave two hundred thousand pounds to my son,\neven to my eldest son if I had more than one? Does not Mr Gresham\nleave all his property to his heir? Why should not I make an eldest\nson as well as Lord de Courcy or the Duke of Omnium? I suppose a\nrailway contractor ought not to be allowed an eldest son by Act of\nParliament! Won't my son have a title to keep up? And that's more\nthan the Greshams have among them.\"\n\nThe doctor explained away what he said as well as he could. He could\nnot explain that what he had really meant was this, that Sir Roger\nScatcherd's son was not a man fit to be trusted with the entire\ncontrol of an enormous fortune.\n\nSir Roger Scatcherd had but one child; that child which had been born\nin the days of his early troubles, and had been dismissed from his\nmother's breast in order that the mother's milk might nourish the\nyoung heir of Greshamsbury. The boy had grown up, but had become\nstrong neither in mind nor body. His father had determined to make\na gentleman of him, and had sent to Eton and to Cambridge. But\neven this receipt, generally as it is recognised, will not make a\ngentleman. It is hard, indeed, to define what receipt will do so,\nthough people do have in their own minds some certain undefined, but\nyet tolerably correct ideas on the subject. Be that as it may, two\nyears at Eton, and three terms at Cambridge, did not make a gentleman\nof Louis Philippe Scatcherd.\n\nYes; he was christened Louis Philippe, after the King of the French.\nIf one wishes to look out in the world for royal nomenclature, to\nfind children who have been christened after kings and queens, or\nthe uncles and aunts of kings and queens, the search should be made\nin the families of democrats. None have so servile a deference for\nthe very nail-parings of royalty; none feel so wondering an awe at\nthe exaltation of a crowned head; none are so anxious to secure\nthemselves some shred or fragment that has been consecrated by the\nroyal touch. It is the distance which they feel to exist between\nthemselves and the throne which makes them covet the crumbs of\nmajesty, the odds and ends and chance splinters of royalty.\n\nThere was nothing royal about Louis Philippe Scatcherd but his\nname. He had now come to man's estate, and his father, finding the\nCambridge receipt to be inefficacious, had sent him abroad to travel\nwith a tutor. The doctor had from time to time heard tidings of this\nyouth; he knew that he had already shown symptoms of his father's\nvices, but no symptoms of his father's talents; he knew that he had\nbegun life by being dissipated, without being generous; and that at\nthe age of twenty-one he had already suffered from delirium tremens.\n\nIt was on this account that he had expressed disapprobation, rather\nthan surprise, when he heard that his father intended to bequeath\nthe bulk of his large fortune to the uncontrolled will of this\nunfortunate boy.\n\n\"I have toiled for my money hard, and I have a right to do as I like\nwith it. What other satisfaction can it give me?\"\n\nThe doctor assured him that he did not at all mean to dispute this.\n\n\"Louis Philippe will do well enough, you'll find,\" continued the\nbaronet, understanding what was passing within his companion's\nbreast. \"Let a young fellow sow his wild oats while he is young, and\nhe'll be steady enough when he grows old.\"\n\n\"But what if he never lives to get through the sowing?\" thought the\ndoctor to himself. \"What if the wild-oats operation is carried on\nin so violent a manner as to leave no strength in the soil for the\nproduct of a more valuable crop?\" It was of no use saying this,\nhowever, so he allowed Scatcherd to continue.\n\n\"If I'd had a free fling when I was a youngster, I shouldn't have\nbeen so fond of the brandy bottle now. But any way, my son shall be\nmy heir. I've had the gumption to make the money, but I haven't the\ngumption to spend it. My son, however, shall be able to ruffle it\nwith the best of them. I'll go bail he shall hold his head higher\nthan ever young Gresham will be able to hold his. They are much of\nthe same age, as well I have cause to remember;--and so has her\nladyship there.\"\n\nNow the fact was, that Sir Roger Scatcherd felt in his heart no\nspecial love for young Gresham; but with her ladyship it might almost\nbe a question whether she did not love the youth whom she had nursed\nalmost as well as that other one who was her own proper offspring.\n\n\"And will you not put any check on thoughtless expenditure? If\nyou live ten or twenty years, as we hope you may, it will become\nunnecessary; but in making a will, a man should always remember he\nmay go off suddenly.\"\n\n\"Especially if he goes to bed with a brandy bottle under his head;\neh, doctor? But, mind, that's a medical secret, you know; not a word\nof that out of the bedroom.\"\n\nDr Thorne could but sigh. What could he say on such a subject to such\na man as this?\n\n\"Yes, I have put a check on his expenditure. I will not let his daily\nbread depend on any man; I have therefore left him five hundred a\nyear at his own disposal, from the day of my death. Let him make what\nducks and drakes of that he can.\"\n\n\"Five hundred a year certainly is not much,\" said the doctor.\n\n\"No; nor do I want to keep him to that. Let him have whatever he\nwants if he sets about spending it properly. But the bulk of the\nproperty--this estate of Boxall Hill, and the Greshamsbury mortgage,\nand those other mortgages--I have tied up in this way: they shall be\nall his at twenty-five; and up to that age it shall be in your power\nto give him what he wants. If he shall die without children before\nhe shall be twenty-five years of age, they are all to go to Mary's\neldest child.\"\n\nNow Mary was Sir Roger's sister, the mother, therefore, of Miss\nThorne, and, consequently, the wife of the respectable ironmonger who\nwent to America, and the mother of a family there.\n\n\"Mary's eldest child!\" said the doctor, feeling that the perspiration\nhad nearly broken out on his forehead, and that he could hardly\ncontrol his feelings. \"Mary's eldest child! Scatcherd, you should\nbe more particular in your description, or you will leave your best\nlegacy to the lawyers.\"\n\n\"I don't know, and never heard the name of one of them.\"\n\n\"But do you mean a boy or a girl?\"\n\n\"They may be all girls for what I know, or all boys; besides, I\ndon't care which it is. A girl would probably do best with it. Only\nyou'd have to see that she married some decent fellow; you'd be her\nguardian.\"\n\n\"Pooh, nonsense,\" said the doctor. \"Louis will be five-and-twenty in\na year or two.\"\n\n\"In about four years.\"\n\n\"And for all that's come and gone yet, Scatcherd, you are not going\nto leave us yourself quite so soon as all that.\"\n\n\"Not if I can help it, doctor; but that's as may be.\"\n\n\"The chances are ten to one that such a clause in your will will\nnever come to bear.\"\n\n\"Quite so, quite so. If I die, Louis Philippe won't; but I thought it\nright to put in something to prevent his squandering it all before he\ncomes to his senses.\"\n\n\"Oh! quite right, quite right. I think I would have named a later age\nthan twenty-five.\"\n\n\"So would not I. Louis Philippe will be all right by that time.\nThat's my lookout. And now, doctor, you know my will; and if I die\nto-morrow, you will know what I want you to do for me.\"\n\n\"You have merely said the eldest child, Scatcherd?\"\n\n\"That's all; give it here, and I'll read it to you.\"\n\n\"No, no; never mind. The eldest child! You should be more particular,\nScatcherd; you should, indeed. Consider what an enormous interest may\nhave to depend on those words.\"\n\n\"Why, what the devil could I say? I don't know their names; never\neven heard them. But the eldest is the eldest, all the world over.\nPerhaps I ought to say the youngest, seeing that I am only a railway\ncontractor.\"\n\nScatcherd began to think that the doctor might now as well go away\nand leave him to the society of Winterbones and the brandy; but, much\nas our friend had before expressed himself in a hurry, he now seemed\ninclined to move very leisurely. He sat there by the bedside, resting\nhis hands on his knees and gazing unconsciously at the counterpane.\nAt last he gave a deep sigh, and then he said, \"Scatcherd, you must\nbe more particular in this. If I am to have anything to do with it,\nyou must, indeed, be more explicit.\"\n\n\"Why, how the deuce can I be more explicit? Isn't her eldest living\nchild plain enough, whether he be Jack, or she be Gill?\"\n\n\"What did your lawyer say to this, Scatcherd?\"\n\n\"Lawyer! You don't suppose I let my lawyer know what I was putting.\nNo; I got the form and the paper, and all that from him, and had him\nhere, in one room, while Winterbones and I did it in another. It's\nall right enough. Though Winterbones wrote it, he did it in such a\nway he did not know what he was writing.\"\n\nThe doctor sat a while longer, still looking at the counterpane,\nand then got up to depart. \"I'll see you again soon,\" said he;\n\"to-morrow, probably.\"\n\n\"To-morrow!\" said Sir Roger, not at all understanding why Dr Thorne\nshould talk of returning so soon. \"To-morrow! why I ain't so bad as\nthat, man, am I? If you come so often as that you'll ruin me.\"\n\n\"Oh, not as a medical man; not as that; but about this will,\nScatcherd. I must think if over; I must, indeed.\"\n\n\"You need not give yourself the least trouble in the world about my\nwill till I'm dead; not the least. And who knows--maybe, I may be\nsettling your affairs yet; eh, doctor? looking after your niece when\nyou're dead and gone, and getting a husband for her, eh? Ha! ha! ha!\"\n\nAnd then, without further speech, the doctor went his way.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nThe Doctor Drinks His Tea\n\n\nThe doctor got on his cob and went his way, returning duly to\nGreshamsbury. But, in truth, as he went he hardly knew whither he was\ngoing, or what he was doing. Sir Roger had hinted that the cob would\nbe compelled to make up for lost time by extra exertion on the road;\nbut the cob had never been permitted to have his own way as to pace\nmore satisfactorily than on the present occasion. The doctor, indeed,\nhardly knew that he was on horseback, so completely was he enveloped\nin the cloud of his own thoughts.\n\nIn the first place, that alternative which it had become him to put\nbefore the baronet as one unlikely to occur--that of the speedy death\nof both father and son--was one which he felt in his heart of hearts\nmight very probably come to pass.\n\n\"The chances are ten to one that such a clause will never be brought\nto bear.\" This he had said partly to himself, so as to ease the\nthoughts which came crowding on his brain; partly, also, in pity for\nthe patient and the father. But now that he thought the matter over,\nhe felt that there were no such odds. Were not the odds the other\nway? Was it not almost probable that both these men might be gathered\nto their long account within the next four years? One, the elder, was\na strong man, indeed; one who might yet live for years to come if he\nwould but give himself fair play. But then, he himself protested,\nand protested with a truth too surely grounded, that fair play to\nhimself was beyond his own power to give. The other, the younger,\nhad everything against him. Not only was he a poor, puny creature,\nwithout physical strength, one of whose life a friend could never\nfeel sure under any circumstances, but he also was already addicted\nto his father's vices; he also was already killing himself with\nalcohol.\n\nAnd then, if these two men did die within the prescribed period, if\nthis clause in Sir Roger's will were brought to bear, if it should\nbecome his, Dr Thorne's, duty to see that clause carried out, how\nwould he be bound to act? That woman's eldest child was his own\nniece, his adopted bairn, his darling, the pride of his heart, the\ncynosure of his eye, his child also, his own Mary. Of all his duties\non this earth, next to that one great duty to his God and conscience,\nwas his duty to her. What, under these circumstances, did his duty to\nher require of him?\n\nBut then, that one great duty, that duty which she would be the first\nto expect from him; what did that demand of him? Had Scatcherd made\nhis will without saying what its clauses were, it seemed to Thorne\nthat Mary must have been the heiress, should that clause become\nnecessarily operative. Whether she were so or not would at any rate\nbe for lawyers to decide. But now the case was very different.\nThis rich man had confided in him, and would it not be a breach of\nconfidence, an act of absolute dishonesty--an act of dishonesty both\nto Scatcherd and to that far-distant American family, to that father,\nwho, in former days, had behaved so nobly, and to that eldest child\nof his, would it not be gross dishonesty to them all if he allowed\nthis man to leave a will by which his property might go to a person\nnever intended to be his heir?\n\nLong before he had arrived at Greshamsbury his mind on this point\nhad been made up. Indeed, it had been made up while sitting there by\nScatcherd's bedside. It had not been difficult to make up his mind to\nso much; but then, his way out of this dishonesty was not so easy for\nhim to find. How should he set this matter right so as to inflict no\ninjury on his niece, and no sorrow to himself--if that indeed could\nbe avoided?\n\nAnd then other thoughts crowded on his brain. He had always\nprofessed--professed at any rate to himself and to her--that of all\nthe vile objects of a man's ambition, wealth, wealth merely for its\nown sake, was the vilest. They, in their joint school of inherent\nphilosophy, had progressed to ideas which they might find it not easy\nto carry out, should they be called on by events to do so. And if\nthis would have been difficult to either when acting on behalf of\nself alone, how much more difficult when one might have to act for\nthe other! This difficulty had now come to the uncle. Should he, in\nthis emergency, take upon himself to fling away the golden chance\nwhich might accrue to his niece if Scatcherd should be encouraged to\nmake her partly his heir?\n\n\"He'd want her to go and live there--to live with him and his wife.\nAll the money in the Bank of England would not pay her for such\nmisery,\" said the doctor to himself, as he slowly rode into his own\nyard.\n\nOn one point, and one only, had he definitely made up his mind. On\nthe following day he would go over again to Boxall Hill, and would\ntell Scatcherd the whole truth. Come what might, the truth must be\nthe best. And so, with some gleam of comfort, he went into the house,\nand found his niece in the drawing-room with Patience Oriel.\n\n\"Mary and I have been quarrelling,\" said Patience. \"She says the\ndoctor is the greatest man in a village; and I say the parson is, of\ncourse.\"\n\n\"I only say that the doctor is the most looked after,\" said Mary.\n\"There's another horrid message for you to go to Silverbridge, uncle.\nWhy can't that Dr Century manage his own people?\"\n\n\"She says,\" continued Miss Oriel, \"that if a parson was away for a\nmonth, no one would miss him; but that a doctor is so precious that\nhis very minutes are counted.\"\n\n\"I am sure uncle's are. They begrudge him his meals. Mr Oriel never\ngets called away to Silverbridge.\"\n\n\"No; we in the Church manage our parish arrangements better than you\ndo. We don't let strange practitioners in among our flocks because\nthe sheep may chance to fancy them. Our sheep have to put up with our\nspiritual doses whether they like them or not. In that respect we are\nmuch the best off. I advise you, Mary, to marry a clergyman, by all\nmeans.\"\n\n\"I will when you marry a doctor,\" said she.\n\n\"I am sure nothing on earth would give me greater pleasure,\" said\nMiss Oriel, getting up and curtseying very low to Dr Thorne; \"but I\nam not quite prepared for the agitation of an offer this morning, so\nI'll run away.\"\n\nAnd so she went; and the doctor, getting on his other horse, started\nagain for Silverbridge, wearily enough. \"She's happy now where she\nis,\" said he to himself, as he rode along. \"They all treat her there\nas an equal at Greshamsbury. What though she be no cousin to the\nThornes of Ullathorne. She has found her place there among them all,\nand keeps it on equal terms with the best of them. There is Miss\nOriel; her family is high; she is rich, fashionable, a beauty,\ncourted by every one; but yet she does not look down on Mary. They\nare equal friends together. But how would it be if she were taken to\nBoxall Hill, even as a recognised niece of the rich man there? Would\nPatience Oriel and Beatrice Gresham go there after her? Could she be\nhappy there as she is in my house here, poor though it be? It would\nkill her to pass a month with Lady Scatcherd and put up with that\nman's humours, to see his mode of life, to be dependent on him, to\nbelong to him.\" And then the doctor, hurrying on to Silverbridge,\nagain met Dr Century at the old lady's bedside, and having made his\nendeavours to stave off the inexorable coming of the grim visitor,\nagain returned to his own niece and his own drawing-room.\n\n\"You must be dead, uncle,\" said Mary, as she poured out his tea for\nhim, and prepared the comforts of that most comfortable meal--tea,\ndinner, and supper, all in one. \"I wish Silverbridge was fifty miles\noff.\"\n\n\"That would only make the journey worse; but I am not dead yet, and,\nwhat is more to the purpose, neither is my patient.\" And as he spoke\nhe contrived to swallow a jorum of scalding tea, containing in\nmeasure somewhat near a pint. Mary, not a whit amazed at this feat,\nmerely refilled the jorum without any observation; and the doctor\nwent on stirring the mixture with his spoon, evidently oblivious that\nany ceremony had been performed by either of them since the first\nsupply had been administered to him.\n\nWhen the clatter of knives and forks was over, the doctor turned\nhimself to the hearthrug, and putting one leg over the other, he\nbegan to nurse it as he looked with complacency at his third cup of\ntea, which stood untasted beside him. The fragments of the solid\nbanquet had been removed, but no sacrilegious hand had been laid on\nthe teapot and the cream-jug.\n\n\"Mary,\" said he, \"suppose you were to find out to-morrow morning\nthat, by some accident, you had become a great heiress, would you be\nable to suppress your exultation?\"\n\n\"The first thing I'd do, would be to pronounce a positive edict that\nyou should never go to Silverbridge again; at least without a day's\nnotice.\"\n\n\"Well, and what next? what would you do next?\"\n\n\"The next thing--the next thing would be to send to Paris for a\nFrench bonnet exactly like the one Patience Oriel had on. Did you see\nit?\"\n\n\"Well I can't say I did; bonnets are invisible now; besides I never\nremark anybody's clothes, except yours.\"\n\n\"Oh! do look at Miss Oriel's bonnet the next time you see her. I\ncannot understand why it should be so, but I am sure of this--no\nEnglish fingers could put together such a bonnet as that; and I am\nnearly sure that no French fingers could do it in England.\"\n\n\"But you don't care so much about bonnets, Mary!\" This the doctor\nsaid as an assertion; but there was, nevertheless, somewhat of a\nquestion involved in it.\n\n\"Don't I, though?\" said she. \"I do care very much about bonnets;\nespecially since I saw Patience this morning. I asked how much it\ncost--guess.\"\n\n\"Oh! I don't know--a pound?\"\n\n\"A pound, uncle!\"\n\n\"What! a great deal more? Ten pounds?\"\n\n\"Oh, uncle.\"\n\n\"What! more than ten pounds? Then I don't think even Patience Oriel\nought to give it.\"\n\n\"No, of course she would not; but, uncle, it really cost a hundred\nfrancs!\"\n\n\"Oh! a hundred francs; that's four pounds, isn't it? Well, and how\nmuch did your last new bonnet cost?\"\n\n\"Mine! oh, nothing--five and ninepence, perhaps; I trimmed it myself.\nIf I were left a great fortune, I'd send to Paris to-morrow; no,\nI'd go myself to Paris to buy a bonnet, and I'd take you with me to\nchoose it.\"\n\nThe doctor sat silent for a while meditating about this, during\nwhich he unconsciously absorbed the tea beside him; and Mary again\nreplenished his cup.\n\n\"Come, Mary,\" said he at last, \"I'm in a generous mood; and as I am\nrather more rich than usual, we'll send to Paris for a French bonnet.\nThe going for it must wait a while longer I am afraid.\"\n\n\"You're joking.\"\n\n\"No, indeed. If you know the way to send--that I must confess would\npuzzle me; but if you'll manage the sending, I'll manage the paying;\nand you shall have a French bonnet.\"\n\n\"Uncle!\" said she, looking up at him.\n\n\"Oh, I'm not joking; I owe you a present, and I'll give you that.\"\n\n\"And if you do, I'll tell you what I'll do with it. I'll cut it into\nfragments, and burn them before your face. Why, uncle, what do you\ntake me for? You're not a bit nice to-night to make such an offer as\nthat to me; not a bit, not a bit.\" And then she came over from her\nseat at the tea-tray and sat down on a foot-stool close at his knee.\n\"Because I'd have a French bonnet if I had a large fortune, is that a\nreason why I should like one now? if you were to pay four pounds for\na bonnet for me, it would scorch my head every time I put it on.\"\n\n\"I don't see that: four pounds would not ruin me. However, I don't\nthink you'd look a bit better if you had it; and, certainly, I should\nnot like to scorch these locks,\" and putting his hand upon her\nshoulders, he played with her hair.\n\n\"Patience has a pony-phaeton, and I'd have one if I were rich; and\nI'd have all my books bound as she does; and, perhaps, I'd give fifty\nguineas for a dressing-case.\"\n\n\"Fifty guineas!\"\n\n\"Patience did not tell me; but so Beatrice says. Patience showed it\nto me once, and it is a darling. I think I'd have the dressing-case\nbefore the bonnet. But, uncle--\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"You don't suppose I want such things?\"\n\n\"Not improperly. I am sure you do not.\"\n\n\"Not properly, or improperly; not much, or little. I covet many\nthings; but nothing of that sort. You know, or should know, that I do\nnot. Why did you talk of buying a French bonnet for me?\"\n\nDr Thorne did not answer this question, but went on nursing his leg.\n\n\"After all,\" said he, \"money is a fine thing.\"\n\n\"Very fine, when it is well come by,\" she answered; \"that is, without\ndetriment to the heart or soul.\"\n\n\"I should be a happier man if you were provided for as is Miss Oriel.\nSuppose, now, I could give you up to a rich man who would be able to\ninsure you against all wants?\"\n\n\"Insure me against all wants! Oh, that would be a man. That would be\nselling me, wouldn't it, uncle? Yes, selling me; and the price you\nwould receive would be freedom from future apprehensions as regards\nme. It would be a cowardly sale for you to make; and then, as to\nme--me the victim. No, uncle; you must bear the misery of having to\nprovide for me--bonnets and all. We are in the same boat, and you\nshan't turn me overboard.\"\n\n\"But if I were to die, what would you do then?\"\n\n\"And if I were to die, what would you do? People must be bound\ntogether. They must depend on each other. Of course, misfortunes may\ncome; but it is cowardly to be afraid of them beforehand. You and I\nare bound together, uncle; and though you say these things to tease\nme, I know you do not wish to get rid of me.\"\n\n\"Well, well; we shall win through, doubtless; if not in one way, then\nin another.\"\n\n\"Win through! Of course we shall; who doubts our winning? but,\nuncle--\"\n\n\"But, Mary.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"You haven't got another cup of tea, have you?\"\n\n\"Oh, uncle! you have had five.\"\n\n\"No, my dear! not five; only four--only four, I assure you; I have\nbeen very particular to count. I had one while I was--\"\n\n\"Five uncle; indeed and indeed.\"\n\n\"Well, then, as I hate the prejudice which attaches luck to an odd\nnumber, I'll have a sixth to show that I am not superstitious.\"\n\nWhile Mary was preparing the sixth jorum, there came a knock at the\ndoor. Those late summonses were hateful to Mary's ear, for they were\nusually the forerunners of a midnight ride through the dark lanes to\nsome farmer's house. The doctor had been in the saddle all day, and,\nas Janet brought the note into the room, Mary stood up as though to\ndefend her uncle from any further invasion on his rest.\n\n\"A note from the house, miss,\" said Janet: now \"the house,\" in\nGreshamsbury parlance, always meant the squire's mansion.\n\n\"No one ill at the house, I hope,\" said the doctor, taking the note\nfrom Mary's hand. \"Oh--ah--yes; it's from the squire--there's nobody\nill: wait a minute, Janet, and I'll write a line. Mary, lend me your\ndesk.\"\n\nThe squire, anxious as usual for money, had written to ask what\nsuccess the doctor had had in negotiating the new loan with Sir\nRoger. The fact, however, was, that in his visit at Boxall Hill, the\ndoctor had been altogether unable to bring on the carpet the matter\nof this loan. Subjects had crowded themselves in too quickly during\nthat interview--those two interviews at Sir Roger's bedside; and he\nhad been obliged to leave without even alluding to the question.\n\n\"I must at any rate go back now,\" said he to himself. So he wrote to\nthe squire, saying that he was to be at Boxall Hill again on the\nfollowing day, and that he would call at the house on his return.\n\n\"That's settled, at any rate,\" said he.\n\n\"What's settled?\" said Mary.\n\n\"Why, I must go to Boxall Hill again to-morrow. I must go early, too,\nso we'd better both be off to bed. Tell Janet I must breakfast at\nhalf-past seven.\"\n\n\"You couldn't take me, could you? I should so like to see that Sir\nRoger.\"\n\n\"To see Sir Roger! Why, he's ill in bed.\"\n\n\"That's an objection, certainly; but some day, when he's well, could\nnot you take me over? I have the greatest desire to see a man like\nthat; a man who began with nothing and now has more than enough to\nbuy the whole parish of Greshamsbury.\"\n\n\"I don't think you'd like him at all.\"\n\n\"Why not? I am sure I should; I am sure I should like him, and Lady\nScatcherd, too. I've heard you say that she is an excellent woman.\"\n\n\"Yes, in her way; and he, too, is good in his way; but they are\nneither of them in your way: they are extremely vulgar--\"\n\n\"Oh! I don't mind that; that would make them more amusing; one\ndoesn't go to those sort of people for polished manners.\"\n\n\"I don't think you'd find the Scatcherds pleasant acquaintances at\nall,\" said the doctor, taking his bed-candle, and kissing his niece's\nforehead as he left the room.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nWhen Greek Meets Greek, Then Comes the Tug of War\n\n\nThe doctor, that is our doctor, had thought nothing more of the\nmessage which had been sent to that other doctor, Dr Fillgrave; nor\nin truth did the baronet. Lady Scatcherd had thought of it, but her\nhusband during the rest of the day was not in a humour which allowed\nher to remind him that he would soon have a new physician on his\nhands; so she left the difficulty to arrange itself, waiting in some\nlittle trepidation till Dr Fillgrave should show himself.\n\nIt was well that Sir Roger was not dying for want of his assistance,\nfor when the message reached Barchester, Dr Fillgrave was some five\nor six miles out of town, at Plumstead; and as he did not get back\ntill late in the evening, he felt himself necessitated to put off his\nvisit to Boxall Hill till next morning. Had he chanced to have been\nmade acquainted with that little conversation about the pump, he\nwould probably have postponed it even yet a while longer.\n\nHe was, however, by no means sorry to be summoned to the bedside of\nSir Roger Scatcherd. It was well known at Barchester, and very well\nknown to Dr Fillgrave, that Sir Roger and Dr Thorne were old friends.\nIt was very well known to him also, that Sir Roger, in all his bodily\nailments, had hitherto been contented to entrust his safety to the\nskill of his old friend. Sir Roger was in his way a great man, and\nmuch talked of in Barchester, and rumour had already reached the\nears of the Barchester Galen, that the great railway contractor was\nill. When, therefore, he received a peremptory summons to go over to\nBoxall Hill, he could not but think that some pure light had broken\nin upon Sir Roger's darkness, and taught him at last where to look\nfor true medical accomplishment.\n\nAnd then, also, Sir Roger was the richest man in the county, and to\ncounty practitioners a new patient with large means is a godsend; how\nmuch greater a godsend when he be not only acquired, but taken also\nfrom some rival practitioner, need hardly be explained.\n\nDr Fillgrave, therefore, was somewhat elated when, after a very early\nbreakfast, he stepped into the post-chaise which was to carry him\nto Boxall Hill. Dr Fillgrave's professional advancement had been\nsufficient to justify the establishment of a brougham, in which he\npaid his ordinary visits round Barchester; but this was a special\noccasion, requiring special speed, and about to produce no doubt a\nspecial guerdon, and therefore a pair of post-horses were put into\nrequest.\n\nIt was hardly yet nine when the post-boy somewhat loudly rang the\nbell at Sir Roger's door; and then Dr Fillgrave, for the first time,\nfound himself in the new grand hall of Boxall Hill house.\n\n\"I'll tell my lady,\" said the servant, showing him into the grand\ndining-room; and there for some fifteen minutes or twenty minutes Dr\nFillgrave walked up and down the length of the Turkey carpet all\nalone.\n\nDr Fillgrave was not a tall man, and was perhaps rather more inclined\nto corpulence than became his height. In his stocking-feet, according\nto the usually received style of measurement, he was five feet five;\nand he had a little round abdominal protuberance, which an inch and a\nhalf added to the heels of his boots hardly enabled him to carry off\nas well as he himself would have wished. Of this he was apparently\nconscious, and it gave to him an air of not being entirely at his\nease. There was, however, a personal dignity in his demeanour, a\npropriety in his gait, and an air of authority in his gestures which\nshould prohibit one from stigmatizing those efforts at altitude as a\nfailure. No doubt he did achieve much; but, nevertheless, the effort\nwould occasionally betray itself, and the story of the frog and the\nox would irresistibly force itself into one's mind at those moments\nwhen it most behoved Dr Fillgrave to be magnificent.\n\nBut if the bulgy roundness of his person and the shortness of his\nlegs in any way detracted from his personal importance, these\ntrifling defects were, he was well aware, more than atoned for by the\npeculiar dignity of his countenance. If his legs were short, his face\nwas not; if there was any undue preponderance below the waistcoat,\nall was in due symmetry above the necktie. His hair was grey, not\ngrizzled nor white, but properly grey; and stood up straight from off\nhis temples on each side with an unbending determination of purpose.\nHis whiskers, which were of an admirable shape, coming down and\nturning gracefully at the angle of his jaw, were grey also, but\nsomewhat darker than his hair. His enemies in Barchester declared\nthat their perfect shade was produced by a leaden comb. His eyes were\nnot brilliant, but were very effective, and well under command. He\nwas rather short-sighted, and a pair of eye-glasses was always on his\nnose, or in his hand. His nose was long, and well pronounced, and his\nchin, also, was sufficiently prominent; but the great feature of his\nface was his mouth. The amount of secret medical knowledge of which\nhe could give assurance by the pressure of those lips was truly\nwonderful. By his lips, also, he could be most exquisitely courteous,\nor most sternly forbidding. And not only could he be either the one\nor the other; but he could at his will assume any shade of difference\nbetween the two, and produce any mixture of sentiment.\n\nWhen Dr Fillgrave was first shown into Sir Roger's dining-room, he\nwalked up and down the room for a while with easy, jaunty step, with\nhis hands joined together behind his back, calculating the price\nof the furniture, and counting the heads which might be adequately\nentertained in a room of such noble proportions; but in seven or\neight minutes an air of impatience might have been seen to suffuse\nhis face. Why could he not be shown into the sick man's room? What\nnecessity could there be for keeping him there, as though he were\nsome apothecary with a box of leeches in his pocket? He then rang\nthe bell, perhaps a little violently. \"Does Sir Roger know that I am\nhere?\" he said to the servant. \"I'll tell my lady,\" said the man,\nagain vanishing.\n\nFor five minutes more he walked up and down, calculating no longer\nthe value of the furniture, but rather that of his own importance.\nHe was not wont to be kept waiting in this way; and though Sir Roger\nScatcherd was at present a great and rich man, Dr Fillgrave had\nremembered him a very small and a very poor man. He now began to\nthink of Sir Roger as the stone-mason, and to chafe somewhat more\nviolently at being so kept by such a man.\n\nWhen one is impatient, five minutes is as the duration of all time,\nand a quarter of an hour is eternity. At the end of twenty minutes\nthe step of Dr Fillgrave up and down the room had become very quick,\nand he had just made up his mind that he would not stay there all\nday to the serious detriment, perhaps fatal injury, of his other\nexpectant patients. His hand was again on the bell, and was about to\nbe used with vigour, when the door opened and Lady Scatcherd entered.\n\nThe door opened and Lady Scatcherd entered; but she did so very\nslowly, as though she were afraid to come into her own dining-room.\nWe must go back a little and see how she had been employed during\nthose twenty minutes.\n\n\"Oh, laws!\" Such had been her first exclamation on hearing that the\ndoctor was in the dining-room. She was standing at the time with her\nhousekeeper in a small room in which she kept her linen and jam,\nand in which, in company with the same housekeeper, she spent the\nhappiest moments of her life.\n\n\"Oh laws! now, Hannah, what shall we do?\"\n\n\"Send 'un up at once to master, my lady! let John take 'un up.\"\n\n\"There'll be such a row in the house, Hannah; I know there will.\"\n\n\"But sure-ly didn't he send for 'un? Let the master have the row\nhimself, then; that's what I'd do, my lady,\" added Hannah, seeing\nthat her ladyship still stood trembling in doubt, biting her\nthumb-nail.\n\n\"You couldn't go up to the master yourself, could you now, Hannah?\"\nsaid Lady Scatcherd in her most persuasive tone.\n\n\"Why no,\" said Hannah, after a little deliberation; \"no, I'm afeard I\ncouldn't.\"\n\n\"Then I must just face it myself.\" And up went the wife to tell her\nlord that the physician for whom he had sent had come to attend his\nbidding.\n\nIn the interview which then took place the baronet had not indeed\nbeen violent, but he had been very determined. Nothing on earth, he\nsaid, should induce him to see Dr Fillgrave and offend his dear old\nfriend Dr Thorne.\n\n\"But Roger,\" said her ladyship, half crying, or rather pretending to\ncry in her vexation, \"what shall I do with the man? How shall I get\nhim out of the house?\"\n\n\"Put him under the pump,\" said the baronet; and he laughed his\npeculiar low guttural laugh, which told so plainly of the havoc which\nbrandy had made in his throat.\n\n\"That's nonsense, Roger; you know I can't put him under the pump. Now\nyou are ill, and you'd better see him just for five minutes. I'll\nmake it all right with Dr Thorne.\"\n\n\"I'll be d---- if I do, my lady.\" All the people about Boxall Hill\ncalled poor Lady Scatcherd \"my lady\" as if there was some excellent\njoke in it; and, so, indeed, there was.\n\n\"You know you needn't mind nothing he says, nor yet take nothing he\nsends: and I'll tell him not to come no more. Now do 'ee see him,\nRoger.\"\n\nBut there was no coaxing Roger over now, or indeed ever: he was a\nwilful, headstrong, masterful man; a tyrant always though never\na cruel one; and accustomed to rule his wife and household as\ndespotically as he did his gangs of workmen. Such men it is not easy\nto coax over.\n\n\"You go down and tell him I don't want him, and won't see him, and\nthat's an end of it. If he chose to earn his money, why didn't he\ncome yesterday when he was sent for? I'm well now, and don't want\nhim; and what's more, I won't have him. Winterbones, lock the door.\"\n\nSo Winterbones, who during this interview had been at work at his\nlittle table, got up to lock the door, and Lady Scatcherd had no\nalternative but to pass through it before the last edict was obeyed.\n\nLady Scatcherd, with slow step, went downstairs and again sought\ncounsel with Hannah, and the two, putting their heads together,\nagreed that the only cure for the present evil was to be found in a\ngood fee. So Lady Scatcherd, with a five-pound note in her hand, and\ntrembling in every limb, went forth to encounter the august presence\nof Dr Fillgrave.\n\nAs the door opened, Dr Fillgrave dropped the bell-rope which was in\nhis hand, and bowed low to the lady. Those who knew the doctor well,\nwould have known from his bow that he was not well pleased; it was\nas much as though he said, \"Lady Scatcherd, I am your most obedient\nhumble servant; at any rate it appears that it is your pleasure to\ntreat me as such.\"\n\nLady Scatcherd did not understand all this; but she perceived at once\nthat the man was angry.\n\n\"I hope Sir Roger does not find himself worse,\" said the doctor. \"The\nmorning is getting on; shall I step up and see him?\"\n\n\"Hem! ha! oh! Why, you see, Dr Fillgrave, Sir Roger finds hisself\nvastly better this morning, vastly so.\"\n\n\"I'm very glad to hear it; but as the morning is getting on, shall I\nstep up to see Sir Roger?\"\n\n\"Why, Dr Fillgrave, sir, you see, he finds hisself so much hisself\nthis morning, that he a'most thinks it would be a shame to trouble\nyou.\"\n\n\"A shame to trouble me!\" This was the sort of shame which Dr\nFillgrave did not at all comprehend. \"A shame to trouble me! Why Lady\nScatcherd--\"\n\nLady Scatcherd saw that she had nothing for it but to make the whole\nmatter intelligible. Moreover, seeing that she appreciated more\nthoroughly the smallness of Dr Fillgrave's person than she did the\npeculiar greatness of his demeanour, she began to be a shade less\nafraid of him than she had thought she should have been.\n\n\"Yes, Dr Fillgrave; you see, when a man like he gets well, he can't\nabide the idea of doctors: now, yesterday, he was all for sending for\nyou; but to-day he comes to hisself, and don't seem to want no doctor\nat all.\"\n\nThen did Dr Fillgrave seem to grow out of his boots, so suddenly did\nhe take upon himself sundry modes of expansive attitude;--to grow out\nof his boots and to swell upwards, till his angry eyes almost looked\ndown on Lady Scatcherd, and each erect hair bristled up towards the\nheavens.\n\n\"This is very singular, very singular, Lady Scatcherd; very singular,\nindeed; very singular; quite unusual. I have come here from\nBarchester, at some considerable inconvenience, at some very\nconsiderable inconvenience, I may say, to my regular patients;\nand--and--and--I don't know that anything so very singular ever\noccurred to me before.\" And then Dr Fillgrave, with a compression of\nhis lips which almost made the poor woman sink into the ground, moved\ntowards the door.\n\nThen Lady Scatcherd bethought her of her great panacea. \"It isn't\nabout the money, you know, doctor,\" said she; \"of course Sir Roger\ndon't expect you to come here with post-horses for nothing.\" In this,\nby the by, Lady Scatcherd did not stick quite close to veracity,\nfor Sir Roger, had he known it, would by no means have assented to\nany payment; and the note which her ladyship held in her hand was\ntaken from her own private purse. \"It ain't at all about the money,\ndoctor;\" and then she tendered the bank-note, which she thought would\nimmediately make all things smooth.\n\nNow Dr Fillgrave dearly loved a five-pound fee. What physician is so\nunnatural as not to love it? He dearly loved a five-pound fee; but he\nloved his dignity better. He was angry also; and like all angry men,\nhe loved his grievance. He felt that he had been badly treated; but\nif he took the money he would throw away his right to indulge in any\nsuch feeling. At that moment his outraged dignity and his cherished\nanger were worth more than a five-pound note. He looked at it with\nwishful but still averted eyes, and then sternly refused the tender.\n\n\"No, madam,\" said he; \"no, no;\" and with his right hand raised with\nhis eye-glasses in it, he motioned away the tempting paper. \"No; I\nshould have been happy to have given Sir Roger the benefit of any\nmedical skill I may have, seeing that I was specially called in--\"\n\n\"But, doctor; if the man's well, you know--\"\n\n\"Oh, of course; if he's well, and does not choose to see me, there's\nan end of it. Should he have any relapse, as my time is valuable, he\nwill perhaps oblige me by sending elsewhere. Madam, good morning.\nI will, if you will allow me, ring for my carriage--that is,\npost-chaise.\"\n\n\"But, doctor, you'll take the money; you must take the money; indeed\nyou'll take the money,\" said Lady Scatcherd, who had now become\nreally unhappy at the idea that her husband's unpardonable whim had\nbrought this man with post-horses all the way from Barchester, and\nthat he was to be paid nothing for his time nor costs.\n\n\"No, madam, no. I could not think of it. Sir Roger, I have no doubt,\nwill know better another time. It is not a question of money; not at\nall.\"\n\n\"But it is a question of money, doctor; and you really shall, you\nmust.\" And poor Lady Scatcherd, in her anxiety to acquit herself at\nany rate of any pecuniary debt to the doctor, came to personal close\nquarters with him, with the view of forcing the note into his hands.\n\n\"Quite impossible, quite impossible,\" said the doctor, still\ncherishing his grievance, and valiantly rejecting the root of all\nevil. \"I shall not do anything of the kind, Lady Scatcherd.\"\n\n\"Now doctor, do 'ee; to oblige me.\"\n\n\"Quite out of the question.\" And so, with his hands and hat behind\nhis back, in token of his utter refusal to accept any pecuniary\naccommodation of his injury, he made his way backwards to the door,\nher ladyship perseveringly pressing him in front. So eager had been\nthe attack on him, that he had not waited to give his order about the\npost-chaise, but made his way at once towards the hall.\n\n\"Now, do 'ee take it, do 'ee,\" pressed Lady Scatcherd.\n\n\"Utterly out of the question,\" said Dr Fillgrave, with great\ndeliberation, as he backed his way into the hall. As he did so, of\ncourse he turned round,--and he found himself almost in the arms of\nDr Thorne.\n\nAs Burley must have glared at Bothwell when they rushed together in\nthe dread encounter on the mountain side; as Achilles may have glared\nat Hector when at last they met, each resolved to test in fatal\nconflict the prowess of the other, so did Dr Fillgrave glare at his\nfoe from Greshamsbury, when, on turning round on his exalted heel,\nhe found his nose on a level with the top button of Dr Thorne's\nwaistcoat.\n\nAnd here, if it be not too tedious, let us pause a while to\nrecapitulate and add up the undoubted grievances of the Barchester\npractitioner. He had made no effort to ingratiate himself into the\nsheepfold of that other shepherd-dog; it was not by his seeking that\nhe was now at Boxall Hill; much as he hated Dr Thorne, full sure\nas he felt of that man's utter ignorance, of his incapacity to\nadminister properly even a black dose, of his murdering propensities\nand his low, mean, unprofessional style of practice; nevertheless, he\nhad done nothing to undermine him with these Scatcherds. Dr Thorne\nmight have sent every mother's son at Boxall Hill to his long\naccount, and Dr Fillgrave would not have interfered;--would not have\ninterfered unless specially and duly called upon to do so.\n\nBut he had been specially and duly called on. Before such a step was\ntaken some words must undoubtedly have passed on the subject between\nThorne and the Scatcherds. Thorne must have known what was to be\ndone. Having been so called, Dr Fillgrave had come--had come all the\nway in a post-chaise--had been refused admittance to the sick man's\nroom, on the plea that the sick man was no longer sick; and just as\nhe was about to retire fee-less--for the want of the fee was not\nthe less a grievance from the fact of its having been tendered and\nrefused--fee-less, dishonoured, and in dudgeon, he encountered this\nother doctor--this very rival whom he had been sent to supplant; he\nencountered him in the very act of going to the sick man's room.\n\nWhat mad fanatic Burley, what god-succoured insolent Achilles,\never had such cause to swell with wrath as at that moment had Dr\nFillgrave? Had I the pen of Moliere, I could fitly tell of such\nmedical anger, but with no other pen can it be fitly told. He did\nswell, and when the huge bulk of his wrath was added to his natural\nproportions, he loomed gigantic before the eyes of the surrounding\nfollowers of Sir Roger.\n\nDr Thorne stepped back three steps and took his hat from his head,\nhaving, in the passage from the hall-door to the dining-room,\nhitherto omitted to do so. It must be borne in mind that he had no\nconception whatever that Sir Roger had declined to see the physician\nfor whom he had sent; none whatever that the physician was now about\nto return, fee-less, to Barchester.\n\nDr Thorne and Dr Fillgrave were doubtless well-known enemies. All\nthe world of Barchester, and all that portion of the world of London\nwhich is concerned with the lancet and the scalping-knife, were well\naware of this: they were continually writing against each other;\ncontinually speaking against each other; but yet they had never\nhitherto come to that positive personal collision which is held to\njustify a cut direct. They very rarely saw each other; and when they\ndid meet, it was in some casual way in the streets of Barchester or\nelsewhere, and on such occasions their habit had been to bow with\nvery cold propriety.\n\nOn the present occasion, Dr Thorne of course felt that Dr Fillgrave\nhad the whip-hand of him; and, with a sort of manly feeling on\nsuch a point, he conceived it to be most compatible with his own\ndignity to show, under such circumstances, more than his usual\ncourtesy--something, perhaps, amounting almost to cordiality. He\nhad been supplanted, _quoad_ doctor, in the house of this rich,\neccentric, railway baronet, and he would show that he bore no malice\non that account.\n\nSo he smiled blandly as he took off his hat, and in a civil speech he\nexpressed a hope that Dr Fillgrave had not found his patient to be in\nany very unfavourable state.\n\nHere was an aggravation to the already lacerated feelings of the\ninjured man. He had been brought thither to be scoffed at and scorned\nat, that he might be a laughing-stock to his enemies, and food\nfor mirth to the vile-minded. He swelled with noble anger till he\nwould have burst, had it not been for the opportune padding of his\nfrock-coat.\n\n\"Sir,\" said he; \"sir:\" and he could hardly get his lips open to give\nvent to the tumult of his heart. Perhaps he was not wrong; for it may\nbe that his lips were more eloquent than would have been his words.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" said Dr Thorne, opening his eyes wide, and\naddressing Lady Scatcherd over the head and across the hairs of the\nirritated man below him. \"What on earth is the matter? Is anything\nwrong with Sir Roger?\"\n\n\"Oh, laws, doctor!\" said her ladyship. \"Oh, laws; I'm sure it ain't\nmy fault. Here's Dr Fillgrave in a taking, and I'm quite ready to\npay him,--quite. If a man gets paid, what more can he want?\" And she\nagain held out the five-pound note over Dr Fillgrave's head.\n\nWhat more, indeed, Lady Scatcherd, can any of us want, if only\nwe could keep our tempers and feelings a little in abeyance? Dr\nFillgrave, however, could not so keep his; and, therefore, he did\nwant something more, though at the present moment he could have\nhardly said what.\n\nLady Scatcherd's courage was somewhat resuscitated by the presence of\nher ancient trusty ally; and, moreover, she began to conceive that\nthe little man before her was unreasonable beyond all conscience in\nhis anger, seeing that that for which he was ready to work had been\noffered to him without any work at all.\n\n\"Madam,\" said he, again turning round at Lady Scatcherd, \"I was\nnever before treated in such a way in any house in Barchester--\nnever--never.\"\n\n\"Good heavens, Dr Fillgrave!\" said he of Greshamsbury, \"what is the\nmatter?\"\n\n\"I'll let you know what is the matter, sir,\" said he, turning round\nagain as quickly as before. \"I'll let you know what is the matter.\nI'll publish this, sir, to the medical world;\" and as he shrieked\nout the words of the threat, he stood on tiptoes and brandished his\neye-glasses up almost into his enemy's face.\n\n\"Don't be angry with Dr Thorne,\" said Lady Scatcherd. \"Any ways, you\nneedn't be angry with him. If you must be angry with anybody--\"\n\n\"I shall be angry with him, madam,\" ejaculated Dr Fillgrave, making\nanother sudden demi-pirouette. \"I am angry with him--or, rather, I\ndespise him;\" and completing the circle, Dr Fillgrave again brought\nhimself round in full front of his foe.\n\nDr Thorne raised his eyebrows and looked inquiringly at Lady\nScatcherd; but there was a quiet sarcastic motion round his mouth\nwhich by no means had the effect of throwing oil on the troubled\nwaters.\n\n\"I'll publish the whole of this transaction to the medical world, Dr\nThorne--the whole of it; and if that has not the effect of rescuing\nthe people of Greshamsbury out of your hands, then--then--then, I\ndon't know what will. Is my carriage--that is, post-chaise there?\"\nand Dr Fillgrave, speaking very loudly, turned majestically to one of\nthe servants.\n\n\"What have I done to you, Dr Fillgrave,\" said Dr Thorne, now\nabsolutely laughing, \"that you should determine to take my bread out\nof my mouth? I am not interfering with your patient. I have come here\nsimply with reference to money matters appertaining to Sir Roger.\"\n\n\"Money matters! Very well--very well; money matters. That is your\nidea of medical practice! Very well--very well. Is my post-chaise at\nthe door? I'll publish it all to the medical world--every word--every\nword of it, every word of it.\"\n\n\"Publish what, you unreasonable man?\"\n\n\"Man! sir; whom do you call a man? I'll let you know whether I'm a\nman--post-chaise there!\"\n\n\"Don't 'ee call him names now, doctor; don't 'ee, pray don't 'ee,\"\nsaid Lady Scatcherd.\n\nBy this time they had all got somewhere nearer the hall-door; but the\nScatcherd retainers were too fond of the row to absent themselves\nwillingly at Dr Fillgrave's bidding, and it did not appear that any\none went in search of the post-chaise.\n\n\"Man! sir; I'll let you know what it is to speak to me in that style.\nI think, sir, you hardly know who I am.\"\n\n\"All that I know of you at present is, that you are my friend Sir\nRoger's physician, and I cannot conceive what has occurred to make\nyou so angry.\" And as he spoke, Dr Thorne looked carefully at him to\nsee whether that pump-discipline had in truth been applied. There\nwere no signs whatever that cold water had been thrown upon Dr\nFillgrave.\n\n\"My post-chaise--is my post-chaise there? The medical world shall\nknow all; you may be sure, sir, the medical world shall know it all;\"\nand thus, ordering his post-chaise, and threatening Dr Thorne with\nthe medical world, Dr Fillgrave made his way to the door.\n\nBut the moment he put on his hat he returned. \"No, madam,\" said\nhe. \"No; it is quite out of the question: such an affair is not\nto be arranged by such means. I'll publish it all to the medical\nworld--post-chaise there!\" and then, using all his force, he flung\nas far as he could into the hall a light bit of paper. It fell at Dr\nThorne's feet, who, raising it, found that it was a five-pound note.\n\n\"I put it into his hat just while he was in his tantrum,\" said Lady\nScatcherd. \"And I thought that perhaps he would not find it till he\ngot to Barchester. Well I wish he'd been paid, certainly, although\nSir Roger wouldn't see him;\" and in this manner Dr Thorne got some\nglimpse of understanding into the cause of the great offence.\n\n\"I wonder whether Sir Roger will see _me_,\" said he, laughing.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nThe Two Uncles\n\n\n\"Ha! ha! ha! Ha! ha! ha!\" laughed Sir Roger, lustily, as Dr Thorne\nentered the room. \"Well, if that ain't rich, I don't know what is.\nHa! ha! ha! But why did they not put him under the pump, doctor?\"\n\nThe doctor, however, had too much tact, and too many things of\nimportance to say, to allow of his giving up much time to the\ndiscussion of Dr Fillgrave's wrath. He had come determined to open\nthe baronet's eyes as to what would be the real effect of his will,\nand he had also to negotiate a loan for Mr Gresham, if that might be\npossible. Dr Thorne therefore began about the loan, that being the\neasier subject, and found that Sir Roger was quite clear-headed as to\nhis money concerns, in spite of his illness. Sir Roger was willing\nenough to lend Mr Gresham more money--six, eight, ten, twenty\nthousand; but then, in doing so, he should insist on obtaining\npossession of the title-deeds.\n\n\"What! the title-deeds of Greshamsbury for a few thousand pounds?\"\nsaid the doctor.\n\n\"I don't know whether you call ninety thousand pounds a few\nthousands; but the debt will about amount to that.\"\n\n\"Ah! that's the old debt.\"\n\n\"Old and new together, of course; every shilling I lend more weakens\nmy security for what I have lent before.\"\n\n\"But you have the first claim, Sir Roger.\"\n\n\"It ought to be first and last to cover such a debt as that. If he\nwants further accommodation, he must part with his deeds, doctor.\"\n\nThe point was argued backwards and forwards for some time without\navail, and the doctor then thought it well to introduce the other\nsubject.\n\n\"Well, Sir Roger, you're a hard man.\"\n\n\"No I ain't,\" said Sir Roger; \"not a bit hard; that is, not a bit too\nhard. Money is always hard. I know I found it hard to come by; and\nthere is no reason why Squire Gresham should expect to find me so\nvery soft.\"\n\n\"Very well; there is an end of that. I thought you would have done as\nmuch to oblige me, that is all.\"\n\n\"What! take bad security to oblige you?\"\n\n\"Well, there's an end of that.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what; I'll do as much to oblige a friend as any one.\nI'll lend you five thousand pounds, you yourself, without security at\nall, if you want it.\"\n\n\"But you know I don't want it; or, at any rate, shan't take it.\"\n\n\"But to ask me to go on lending money to a third party, and he over\nhead and ears in debt, by way of obliging you, why, it's a little too\nmuch.\"\n\n\"Well, there's an end of it. Now I've something to say to you about\nthat will of yours.\"\n\n\"Oh! that's settled.\"\n\n\"No, Scatcherd; it isn't settled. It must be a great deal more\nsettled before we have done with it, as you'll find when you hear\nwhat I have to tell you.\"\n\n\"What you have to tell me!\" said Sir Roger, sitting up in bed; \"and\nwhat have you to tell me?\"\n\n\"Your will says your sister's eldest child.\"\n\n\"Yes; but that's only in the event of Louis Philippe dying before he\nis twenty-five.\"\n\n\"Exactly; and now I know something about your sister's eldest child,\nand, therefore, I have come to tell you.\"\n\n\"You know something about Mary's eldest child?\"\n\n\"I do, Scatcherd; it is a strange story, and maybe it will make you\nangry. I cannot help it if it does so. I should not tell you this if\nI could avoid it; but as I do tell you, for your sake, as you will\nsee, and not for my own, I must implore you not to tell my secret to\nothers.\"\n\nSir Roger now looked at him with an altered countenance. There was\nsomething in his voice of the authoritative tone of other days,\nsomething in the doctor's look which had on the baronet the same\neffect which in former days it had sometimes had on the stone-mason.\n\n\"Can you give me a promise, Scatcherd, that what I am about to tell\nyou shall not be repeated?\"\n\n\"A promise! Well, I don't know what it's about, you know. I don't\nlike promises in the dark.\"\n\n\"Then I must leave it to your honour; for what I have to say must be\nsaid. You remember my brother, Scatcherd?\"\n\nRemember his brother! thought the rich man to himself. The name of\nthe doctor's brother had not been alluded to between them since the\ndays of that trial; but still it was impossible but that Scatcherd\nshould well remember him.\n\n\"Yes, yes; certainly. I remember your brother,\" said he. \"I remember\nhim well; there's no doubt about that.\"\n\n\"Well, Scatcherd,\" and, as he spoke, the doctor laid his hand with\nkindness on the other's arm. \"Mary's eldest child was my brother's\nchild as well.\n\n\"But there is no such child living,\" said Sir Roger; and, in his\nviolence, as he spoke he threw from off him the bedclothes, and tried\nto stand upon the floor. He found, however, that he had no strength\nfor such an effort, and was obliged to remain leaning on the bed and\nresting on the doctor's arm.\n\n\"There was no such child ever lived,\" said he. \"What do you mean by\nthis?\"\n\nDr Thorne would say nothing further till he had got the man into bed\nagain. This he at last effected, and then he went on with the story\nin his own way.\n\n\"Yes, Scatcherd, that child is alive; and for fear that you should\nunintentionally make her your heir, I have thought it right to tell\nyou this.\"\n\n\"A girl, is it?\"\n\n\"Yes, a girl.\"\n\n\"And why should you want to spite her? If she is Mary's child, she is\nyour brother's child also. If she is my niece, she must be your niece\ntoo. Why should you want to spite her? Why should you try to do her\nsuch a terrible injury?\"\n\n\"I do not want to spite her.\"\n\n\"Where is she? Who is she? What is she called? Where does she live?\"\n\nThe doctor did not at once answer all these questions. He had made\nup his mind that he would tell Sir Roger that this child was living,\nbut he had not as yet resolved to make known all the circumstances\nof her history. He was not even yet quite aware whether it would be\nnecessary to say that this foundling orphan was the cherished darling\nof his own house.\n\n\"Such a child, is, at any rate, living,\" said he; \"of that I give\nyou my assurance; and under your will, as now worded, it might come\nto pass that that child should be your heir. I do not want to spite\nher, but I should be wrong to let you make your will without such\nknowledge, seeing that I am possessed of it myself.\"\n\n\"But where is the girl?\"\n\n\"I do not know that that signifies.\"\n\n\"Signifies! Yes; it does signify a great deal. But, Thorne, Thorne,\nnow that I remember it, now that I can think of things, it was--was\nit not you yourself who told me that the baby did not live?\"\n\n\"Very possibly.\"\n\n\"And was it a lie that you told me?\"\n\n\"If so, yes. But it is no lie that I tell you now.\"\n\n\"I believed you then, Thorne; then, when I was a poor, broken-down\nday-labourer, lying in jail, rotting there; but I tell you fairly, I\ndo not believe you now. You have some scheme in this.\"\n\n\"Whatever scheme I may have, you can frustrate by making another\nwill. What can I gain by telling you this? I only do so to induce you\nto be more explicit in naming your heir.\"\n\nThey both remained silent for a while, during which the baronet\npoured out from his hidden resource a glass of brandy and swallowed\nit.\n\n\"When a man is taken aback suddenly by such tidings as these, he must\ntake a drop of something, eh, doctor?\"\n\nDr Thorne did not see the necessity; but the present, he felt, was no\ntime for arguing the point.\n\n\"Come, Thorne, where is the girl? You must tell me that. She is my\nniece, and I have a right to know. She shall come here, and I will do\nsomething for her. By the Lord! I would as soon she had the money as\nany one else, if she is anything of a good 'un;--some of it, that is.\nIs she a good 'un?\"\n\n\"Good!\" said the doctor, turning away his face. \"Yes; she is good\nenough.\"\n\n\"She must be grown up by now. None of your light skirts, eh?\"\n\n\"She is a good girl,\" said the doctor somewhat loudly and sternly. He\ncould hardly trust himself to say much on this point.\n\n\"Mary was a good girl, a very good girl, till\"--and Sir Roger raised\nhimself up in his bed with his fist clenched, as though he were again\nabout to strike that fatal blow at the farm-yard gate. \"But come,\nit's no good thinking of that; you behaved well and manly, always.\nAnd so poor Mary's child is alive; at least, you say so.\"\n\n\"I say so, and you may believe it. Why should I deceive you?\"\n\n\"No, no; I don't see why. But then why did you deceive me before?\"\n\nTo this the doctor chose to make no answer, and again there was\nsilence for a while.\n\n\"What do you call her, doctor?\"\n\n\"Her name is Mary.\"\n\n\"The prettiest women's name going; there's no name like it,\" said the\ncontractor, with an unusual tenderness in his voice. \"Mary--yes; but\nMary what? What other name does she go by?\"\n\nHere the doctor hesitated.\n\n\"Mary Scatcherd--eh?\"\n\n\"No. Not Mary Scatcherd.\"\n\n\"Not Mary Scatcherd! Mary what, then? You, with your d---- pride,\nwouldn't let her be called Mary Thorne, I know.\"\n\nThis was too much for the doctor. He felt that there were tears in\nhis eyes, so he walked away to the window to dry them, unseen. Had he\nhad fifty names, each more sacred than the other, the most sacred of\nthem all would hardly have been good enough for her.\n\n\"Mary what, doctor? Come, if the girl is to belong to me, if I am to\nprovide for her, I must know what to call her, and where to look for\nher.\"\n\n\"Who talked of your providing for her?\" said the doctor, turning\nround at the rival uncle. \"Who said that she was to belong to you?\nShe will be no burden to you; you are only told of this that you\nmay not leave your money to her without knowing it. She is provided\nfor--that is, she wants nothing; she will do well enough; you need\nnot trouble yourself about her.\"\n\n\"But if she's Mary's child, Mary's child in real truth, I will\ntrouble myself about her. Who else should do so? For the matter of\nthat, I'd as soon say her as any of those others in America. What do\nI care about blood? I shan't mind her being a bastard. That is to\nsay, of course, if she's decently good. Did she ever get any kind of\nteaching; book-learning, or anything of that sort?\"\n\nDr Thorne at this moment hated his friend the baronet with almost a\ndeadly hatred; that he, rough brute as he was--for he was a rough\nbrute--that he should speak in such language of the angel who gave to\nthat home in Greshamsbury so many of the joys of Paradise--that he\nshould speak of her as in some degree his own, that he should inquire\ndoubtingly as to her attributes and her virtues. And then the doctor\nthought of her Italian and French readings, of her music, of her nice\nbooks, and sweet lady ways, of her happy companionship with Patience\nOriel, and her dear, bosom friendship with Beatrice Gresham. He\nthought of her grace, and winning manners, and soft, polished\nfeminine beauty; and, as he did so, he hated Sir Roger Scatcherd, and\nregarded him with loathing, as he might have regarded a wallowing\nhog.\n\nAt last a light seemed to break in upon Sir Roger's mind. Dr Thorne,\nhe perceived, did not answer his last question. He perceived, also,\nthat the doctor was affected with some more than ordinary emotion.\nWhy should it be that this subject of Mary Scatcherd's child moved\nhim so deeply? Sir Roger had never been at the doctor's house at\nGreshamsbury, had never seen Mary Thorne, but he had heard that\nthere lived with the doctor some young female relative; and thus a\nglimmering light seemed to come in upon Sir Roger's bed.\n\nHe had twitted the doctor with his pride; had said that it was\nimpossible that the girl should be called Mary Thorne. What if she\nwere so called? What if she were now warming herself at the doctor's\nhearth?\n\n\"Well, come, Thorne, what is it you call her? Tell it out, man. And,\nlook you, if it's your name she bears, I shall think more of you, a\ndeal more than ever I did yet. Come, Thorne, I'm her uncle too. I\nhave a right to know. She is Mary Thorne, isn't she?\"\n\nThe doctor had not the hardihood nor the resolution to deny it.\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"that is her name; she lives with me.\"\n\n\"Yes, and lives with all those grand folks at Greshamsbury too. I\nhave heard of that.\"\n\n\"She lives with me, and belongs to me, and is as my daughter.\"\n\n\"She shall come over here. Lady Scatcherd shall have her to stay with\nher. She shall come to us. And as for my will, I'll make another.\nI'll--\"\n\n\"Yes, make another will--or else alter that one. But as to Miss\nThorne coming here--\"\n\n\"What! Mary--\"\n\n\"Well, Mary. As to Mary Thorne coming here, that I fear will not be\npossible. She cannot have two homes. She has cast her lot with one of\nher uncles, and she must remain with him now.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say that she must never have any relation but one?\"\n\n\"But one such as I am. She would not be happy over here. She does not\nlike new faces. You have enough depending on you; I have but her.\"\n\n\"Enough! why, I have only Louis Philippe. I could provide for a dozen\ngirls.\"\n\n\"Well, well, well, we will not talk about that.\"\n\n\"Ah! but, Thorne, you have told me of this girl now, and I cannot but\ntalk of her. If you wished to keep the matter dark, you should have\nsaid nothing about it. She is my niece as much as yours. And, Thorne,\nI loved my sister Mary quite as well as you loved your brother; quite\nas well.\"\n\nAny one who might now have heard and seen the contractor would have\nhardly thought him to be the same man who, a few hours before, was\nurging that the Barchester physician should be put under the pump.\n\n\"You have your son, Scatcherd. I have no one but that girl.\"\n\n\"I don't want to take her from you. I don't want to take her; but\nsurely there can be no harm in her coming here to see us? I can\nprovide for her, Thorne, remember that. I can provide for her without\nreference to Louis Philippe. What are ten or fifteen thousand pounds\nto me? Remember that, Thorne.\"\n\nDr Thorne did remember it. In that interview he remembered many\nthings, and much passed through his mind on which he felt himself\ncompelled to resolve somewhat too suddenly. Would he be justified\nin rejecting, on behalf of Mary, the offer of pecuniary provision\nwhich this rich relative seemed so well inclined to make? Or, if he\naccepted it, would he in truth be studying her interests? Scatcherd\nwas a self-willed, obstinate man--now indeed touched by unwonted\ntenderness; but he was one to whose lasting tenderness Dr Thorne\nwould be very unwilling to trust his darling. He did resolve, that on\nthe whole he should best discharge his duty, even to her, by keeping\nher to himself, and rejecting, on her behalf, any participation in\nthe baronet's wealth. As Mary herself had said, \"some people must\nbe bound together;\" and their destiny, that of himself and his\nniece, seemed to have so bound them. She had found her place at\nGreshamsbury, her place in the world; and it would be better for\nher now to keep it, than to go forth and seek another that would be\nricher, but at the same time less suited to her.\n\n\"No, Scatcherd,\" he said at last, \"she cannot come here; she would\nnot be happy here, and, to tell the truth, I do not wish her to know\nthat she has other relatives.\"\n\n\"Ah! she would be ashamed of her mother, you mean, and of her\nmother's brother too, eh? She's too fine a lady, I suppose, to take\nme by the hand and give me a kiss, and call me her uncle? I and Lady\nScatcherd would not be grand enough for her, eh?\"\n\n\"You may say what you please, Scatcherd: I of course cannot stop\nyou.\"\n\n\"But I don't know how you'll reconcile what you are doing to your\nconscience. What right can you have to throw away the girl's chance,\nnow that she has a chance? What fortune can you give her?\"\n\n\"I have done what little I could,\" said Thorne, proudly.\n\n\"Well, well, well, well, I never heard such a thing in my life;\nnever. Mary's child, my own Mary's child, and I'm not to see her!\nBut, Thorne, I tell you what; I will see her. I'll go over to her,\nI'll go to Greshamsbury, and tell her who I am, and what I can do\nfor her. I tell you fairly I will. You shall not keep her away from\nthose who belong to her, and can do her a good turn. Mary's daughter;\nanother Mary Scatcherd! I almost wish she were called Mary Scatcherd.\nIs she like her, Thorne? Come, tell me that, is she like her mother.\"\n\n\"I do not remember her mother; at least not in health.\"\n\n\"Not remember her! ah, well. She was the handsomest girl in\nBarchester, anyhow. That was given up to her. Well, I didn't think to\nbe talking of her again. Thorne, you cannot but expect that I shall\ngo over and see Mary's child?\"\n\n\"Now, Scatcherd, look here,\" and the doctor, coming away from the\nwindow, where he had been standing, sat himself down by the bedside,\n\"you must not come over to Greshamsbury.\"\n\n\"Oh! but I shall.\"\n\n\"Listen to me, Scatcherd. I do not want to praise myself in any way;\nbut when that girl was an infant, six months old, she was like to be\na thorough obstacle to her mother's fortune in life. Tomlinson was\nwilling to marry your sister, but he would not marry the child too.\nThen I took the baby, and I promised her mother that I would be to\nher as a father. I have kept my word as fairly as I have been able.\nShe has sat at my hearth, and drunk of my cup, and been to me as my\nown child. After that, I have a right to judge what is best for her.\nHer life is not like your life, and her ways are not as your ways--\"\n\n\"Ah, that is just it; we are too vulgar for her.\"\n\n\"You may take it as you will,\" said the doctor, who was too much in\nearnest to be in the least afraid of offending his companion. \"I have\nnot said so; but I do say that you and she are unlike in your way of\nliving.\"\n\n\"She wouldn't like an uncle with a brandy bottle under his head, eh?\"\n\n\"You could not see her without letting her know what is the connexion\nbetween you; of that I wish to keep her in ignorance.\"\n\n\"I never knew any one yet who was ashamed of a rich connexion. How do\nyou mean to get a husband for her, eh?\"\n\n\"I have told you of her existence,\" continued the doctor, not\nappearing to notice what the baronet had last said, \"because I found\nit necessary that you should know the fact of your sister having left\nthis child behind her; you would otherwise have made a will different\nfrom that intended, and there might have been a lawsuit, and mischief\nand misery when we are gone. You must perceive that I have done this\nin honesty to you; and you yourself are too honest to repay me by\ntaking advantage of this knowledge to make me unhappy.\"\n\n\"Oh, very well, doctor. At any rate, you are a brick, I will say\nthat. But I'll think of all this, I'll think of it; but it does\nstartle me to find that poor Mary has a child living so near to me.\"\n\n\"And now, Scatcherd, I will say good-bye. We part as friends, don't\nwe?\"\n\n\"Oh, but doctor, you ain't going to leave me so. What am I to do?\nWhat doses shall I take? How much brandy may I drink? May I have a\ngrill for dinner? D---- me, doctor, you have turned Fillgrave out of\nthe house. You mustn't go and desert me.\"\n\nDr Thorne laughed, and then, sitting himself down to write medically,\ngave such prescriptions and ordinances as he found to be necessary.\nThey amounted but to this: that the man was to drink, if possible, no\nbrandy; and if that were not possible, then as little as might be.\n\nThis having been done, the doctor again proceeded to take his leave;\nbut when he got to the door he was called back. \"Thorne! Thorne!\nAbout that money for Mr Gresham; do what you like, do just what\nyou like. Ten thousand, is it? Well, he shall have it. I'll make\nWinterbones write about it at once. Five per cent., isn't it? No,\nfour and a half. Well, he shall have ten thousand more.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Scatcherd, thank you, I am really very much obliged to\nyou, I am indeed. I wouldn't ask it if I was not sure your money is\nsafe. Good-bye, old fellow, and get rid of that bedfellow of yours,\"\nand again he was at the door.\n\n\"Thorne,\" said Sir Roger once more. \"Thorne, just come back for a\nminute. You wouldn't let me send a present would you,--fifty pounds\nor so,--just to buy a few flounces?\"\n\nThe doctor contrived to escape without giving a definite answer\nto this question; and then, having paid his compliments to Lady\nScatcherd, remounted his cob and rode back to Greshamsbury.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nSentence of Exile\n\n\nDr Thorne did not at once go home to his own house. When he reached\nthe Greshamsbury gates, he sent his horse to its own stable by one of\nthe people at the lodge, and then walked on to the mansion. He had\nto see the squire on the subject of the forthcoming loan, and he had\nalso to see Lady Arabella.\n\nThe Lady Arabella, though she was not personally attached to the\ndoctor with quite so much warmth as some others of her family, still\nhad reasons of her own for not dispensing with his visits to the\nhouse. She was one of his patients, and a patient fearful of the\ndisease with which she was threatened. Though she thought the doctor\nto be arrogant, deficient as to properly submissive demeanour\ntowards herself, an instigator to marital parsimony in her lord,\none altogether opposed to herself and her interest in Greshamsbury\npolitics, nevertheless, she did feel trust in him as a medical man.\nShe had no wish to be rescued out of his hands by any Dr Fillgrave,\nas regarded that complaint of hers, much as she may have desired,\nand did desire, to sever him from all Greshamsbury councils in all\nmatters not touching the healing art.\n\nNow the complaint of which the Lady Arabella was afraid, was cancer:\nand her only present confidant in this matter was Dr Thorne.\n\nThe first of the Greshamsbury circle whom he saw was Beatrice, and he\nmet her in the garden.\n\n\"Oh, doctor,\" said she, \"where has Mary been this age? She has not\nbeen up here since Frank's birthday.\"\n\n\"Well, that was only three days ago. Why don't you go down and ferret\nher out in the village?\"\n\n\"So I have done. I was there just now, and found her out. She was out\nwith Patience Oriel. Patience is all and all with her now. Patience\nis all very well, but if they throw me over--\"\n\n\"My dear Miss Gresham, Patience is and always was a virtue.\"\n\n\"A poor, beggarly, sneaking virtue after all, doctor. They should\nhave come up, seeing how deserted I am here. There's absolutely\nnobody left.\"\n\n\"Has Lady de Courcy gone?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes! All the de Courcys have gone. I think, between ourselves,\nMary stays away because she does not love them too well. They have\nall gone, and taken Augusta and Frank with them.\"\n\n\"Has Frank gone to Courcy Castle?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; did you not hear? There was rather a fight about it. Master\nFrank wanted to get off, and was as hard to catch as an eel, and then\nthe countess was offended; and papa said he didn't see why Frank was\nto go if he didn't like it. Papa is very anxious about his degree,\nyou know.\"\n\nThe doctor understood it all as well as though it had been described\nto him at full length. The countess had claimed her prey, in order\nthat she might carry him off to Miss Dunstable's golden embrace. The\nprey, not yet old enough and wise enough to connect the worship of\nPlutus with that of Venus, had made sundry futile feints and dodges\nin the vain hope of escape. Then the anxious mother had enforced the\nde Courcy behests with all a mother's authority. But the father,\nwhose ideas on the subject of Miss Dunstable's wealth had probably\nnot been consulted, had, as a matter of course, taken exactly the\nother side of the question. The doctor did not require to be told all\nthis in order to know how the battle had raged. He had not yet heard\nof the great Dunstable scheme; but he was sufficiently acquainted\nwith Greshamsbury tactics to understand that the war had been carried\non somewhat after this fashion.\n\nAs a rule, when the squire took a point warmly to heart, he was\nwont to carry his way against the de Courcy interest. He could be\nobstinate enough when it so pleased him, and had before now gone so\nfar as to tell his wife, that her thrice-noble sister-in-law might\nremain at home at Courcy Castle--or, at any rate, not come to\nGreshamsbury--if she could not do so without striving to rule him and\nevery one else when she got here. This had of course been repeated to\nthe countess, who had merely replied to it by a sisterly whisper, in\nwhich she sorrowfully intimated that some men were born brutes, and\nalways would remain so.\n\n\"I think they all are,\" the Lady Arabella had replied; wishing,\nperhaps, to remind her sister-in-law that the breed of brutes was as\nrampant in West Barsetshire as in the eastern division of the county.\n\nThe squire, however, had not fought on this occasion with all his\nvigour. There had, of course, been some passages between him and his\nson, and it had been agreed that Frank should go for a fortnight to\nCourcy Castle.\n\n\"We mustn't quarrel with them, you know, if we can help it,\" said the\nfather; \"and, therefore, you must go sooner or later.\"\n\n\"Well, I suppose so; but you don't know how dull it is, governor.\"\n\n\"Don't I!\" said Gresham.\n\n\"There's a Miss Dunstable to be there; did you ever hear of her,\nsir?\"\n\n\"No, never.\"\n\n\"She's a girl whose father used to make ointment, or something of\nthat sort.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, to be sure; the ointment of Lebanon. He used to cover all\nthe walls in London. I haven't heard of him this year past.\"\n\n\"No; that's because he's dead. Well, she carries on the ointment now,\nI believe; at any rate, she has got all the money. I wonder what\nshe's like.\"\n\n\"You'd better go and see,\" said the father, who now began to have\nsome inkling of an idea why the two ladies were so anxious to carry\nhis son off to Courcy Castle at this exact time. And so Frank had\npacked up his best clothes, given a last fond look at the new black\nhorse, repeated his last special injunctions to Peter, and had then\nmade one of the stately _cort\u00c3\u00a8ge_ which proceeded through the county\nfrom Greshamsbury to Courcy Castle.\n\n\"I am very glad of that, very,\" said the squire, when he heard that\nthe money was to be forthcoming. \"I shall get it on easier terms from\nhim than elsewhere; and it kills me to have continual bother about\nsuch things.\" And Mr Gresham, feeling that that difficulty was tided\nover for a time, and that the immediate pressure of little debts\nwould be abated, stretched himself on his easy chair as though he\nwere quite comfortable;--one may say almost elated.\n\nHow frequent it is that men on their road to ruin feel elation such\nas this! A man signs away a moiety of his substance; nay, that were\nnothing; but a moiety of the substance of his children; he puts\nhis pen to the paper that ruins him and them; but in doing so he\nfrees himself from a score of immediate little pestering, stinging\ntroubles: and, therefore, feels as though fortune has been almost\nkind to him.\n\nThe doctor felt angry with himself for what he had done when he saw\nhow easily the squire adapted himself to this new loan. \"It will make\nScatcherd's claim upon you very heavy,\" said he.\n\nMr Gresham at once read all that was passing through the doctor's\nmind. \"Well, what else can I do?\" said he. \"You wouldn't have me\nallow my daughter to lose this match for the sake of a few thousand\npounds? It will be well at any rate to have one of them settled. Look\nat that letter from Moffat.\"\n\nThe doctor took the letter and read it. It was a long, wordy,\nill-written rigmarole, in which that amorous gentleman spoke with\nmuch rapture of his love and devotion for Miss Gresham; but at the\nsame time declared, and most positively swore, that the adverse\ncruelty of his circumstances was such, that it would not allow him to\nstand up like a man at the hymeneal altar until six thousand pounds\nhard cash had been paid down at his banker's.\n\n\"It may be all right,\" said the squire; \"but in my time gentlemen\nwere not used to write such letters as that to each other.\"\n\nThe doctor shrugged his shoulders. He did not know how far he would\nbe justified in saying much, even to his friend the squire, in\ndispraise of his future son-in-law.\n\n\"I told him that he should have the money; and one would have thought\nthat that would have been enough for him. Well: I suppose Augusta\nlikes him. I suppose she wishes the match; otherwise, I would give\nhim such an answer to that letter as would startle him a little.\"\n\n\"What settlement is he to make?\" said Thorne.\n\n\"Oh, that's satisfactory enough; couldn't be more so; a thousand a\nyear and the house at Wimbledon for her; that's all very well. But\nsuch a lie, you know, Thorne. He's rolling in money, and yet he talks\nof this beggarly sum as though he couldn't possibly stir without it.\"\n\n\"If I might venture to speak my mind,\" said Thorne.\n\n\"Well?\" said the squire, looking at him earnestly.\n\n\"I should be inclined to say that Mr Moffat wants to cry off,\nhimself.\"\n\n\"Oh, impossible; quite impossible. In the first place, he was so very\nanxious for the match. In the next place, it is such a great thing\nfor him. And then, he would never dare; you see, he is dependent on\nthe de Courcys for his seat.\"\n\n\"But suppose he loses his seat?\"\n\n\"But there is not much fear of that, I think. Scatcherd may be a very\nfine fellow, but I think they'll hardly return him at Barchester.\"\n\n\"I don't understand much about it,\" said Thorne; \"but such things do\nhappen.\"\n\n\"And you believe that this man absolutely wants to get off the match;\nabsolutely thinks of playing such a trick as that on my daughter;--on\nme?\"\n\n\"I don't say he intends to do it; but it looks to me as though he\nwere making a door for himself, or trying to make a door: if so, your\nhaving the money will stop him there.\"\n\n\"But, Thorne, don't you think he loves the girl? If I thought not--\"\n\nThe doctor stood silent for a moment, and then he said, \"I am not a\nlove-making man myself, but I think that if I were much in love with\na young lady I should not write such a letter as that to her father.\"\n\n\"By heavens! If I thought so,\" said the squire--\"but, Thorne, we\ncan't judge of those fellows as one does of gentlemen; they are so\nused to making money, and seeing money made, that they have an eye to\nbusiness in everything.\"\n\n\"Perhaps so, perhaps so,\" muttered the doctor, showing evidently that\nhe still doubted the warmth of Mr Moffat's affection.\n\n\"The match was none of my making, and I cannot interfere now to break\nit off: it will give her a good position in the world; for, after\nall, money goes a great way, and it is something to be in Parliament.\nI can only hope she likes him. I do truly hope she likes him;\" and\nthe squire also showed by the tone of his voice that, though he might\nhope that his daughter was in love with her intended husband, he\nhardly conceived it to be possible that she should be so.\n\nAnd what was the truth of the matter? Miss Gresham was no more in\nlove with Mr Moffat than you are--oh, sweet, young, blooming beauty!\nNot a whit more; not, at least, in your sense of the word, nor in\nmine. She had by no means resolved within her heart that of all the\nmen whom she had ever seen, or ever could see, he was far away the\nnicest and best. That is what you will do when you are in love, if\nyou be good for anything. She had no longing to sit near to him--the\nnearer the better; she had no thought of his taste and his choice\nwhen she bought her ribbons and bonnets; she had no indescribable\ndesire that all her female friends should be ever talking to her\nabout him. When she wrote to him, she did not copy her letters again\nand again, so that she might be, as it were, ever speaking to him;\nshe took no special pride in herself because he had chosen her to\nbe his life's partner. In point of fact, she did not care one straw\nabout him.\n\nAnd yet she thought she loved him; was, indeed, quite confident\nthat she did so; told her mother that she was sure Gustavus would\nwish this, she knew Gustavus would like that, and so on; but as for\nGustavus himself, she did not care a chip for him.\n\nShe was in love with her match just as farmers are in love with\nwheat at eighty shillings a quarter; or shareholders--innocent\ngudgeons--with seven and half per cent. interest on their paid-up\ncapital. Eighty shillings a quarter, and seven and half per cent.\ninterest, such were the returns which she had been taught to look\nfor in exchange for her young heart; and, having obtained them, or\nbeing thus about to obtain them, why should not her young heart be\nsatisfied? Had she not sat herself down obediently at the feet of her\nlady Gamaliel, and should she not be rewarded? Yes, indeed, she shall\nbe rewarded.\n\nAnd then the doctor went to the lady. On their medical secrets we\nwill not intrude; but there were other matters bearing on the course\nof our narrative, as to which Lady Arabella found it necessary to say\na word or so to the doctor; and it is essential that we should know\nwhat was the tenor of those few words so spoken.\n\nHow the aspirations, and instincts, and feelings of a household\nbecome changed as the young birds begin to flutter with feathered\nwings, and have half-formed thoughts of leaving the parental nest! A\nfew months back, Frank had reigned almost autocratic over the lesser\nsubjects of the kingdom of Greshamsbury. The servants, for instance,\nalways obeyed him, and his sisters never dreamed of telling anything\nwhich he directed should not be told. All his mischief, all his\ntroubles, and all his loves were confided to them, with the sure\nconviction that they would never be made to stand in evidence against\nhim.\n\nTrusting to this well-ascertained state of things, he had not\nhesitated to declare his love for Miss Thorne before his sister\nAugusta. But his sister Augusta had now, as it were, been received\ninto the upper house; having duly received, and duly profited by the\nlessons of her great instructress, she was now admitted to sit in\nconclave with the higher powers: her sympathies, of course, became\nchanged, and her confidence was removed from the young and giddy\nand given to the ancient and discreet. She was as a schoolboy, who,\nhaving finished his schooling, and being fairly forced by necessity\ninto the stern bread-earning world, undertakes the new duties of\ntutoring. Yesterday he was taught, and fought, of course, against the\nschoolmaster; to-day he teaches, and fights as keenly for him. So\nit was with Augusta Gresham, when, with careful brow, she whispered\nto her mother that there was something wrong between Frank and Mary\nThorne.\n\n\"Stop it at once, Arabella: stop it at once,\" the countess had said;\n\"that, indeed, will be ruin. If he does not marry money, he is lost.\nGood heavens! the doctor's niece! A girl that nobody knows where she\ncomes from!\"\n\n\"He's going with you to-morrow, you know,\" said the anxious mother.\n\n\"Yes; and that is so far well: if he will be led by me, the evil\nmay be remedied before he returns; but it is very, very hard to\nlead young men. Arabella, you must forbid that girl to come to\nGreshamsbury again on any pretext whatever. The evil must be stopped\nat once.\"\n\n\"But she is here so much as a matter of course.\"\n\n\"Then she must be here as a matter of course no more: there has been\nfolly, very great folly, in having her here. Of course she would turn\nout to be a designing creature with such temptation before her; with\nsuch a prize within her reach, how could she help it?\"\n\n\"I must say, aunt, she answered him very properly,\" said Augusta.\n\n\"Nonsense,\" said the countess; \"before you, of course she did.\nArabella, the matter must not be left to the girl's propriety. I\nnever knew the propriety of a girl of that sort to be fit to be\ndepended upon yet. If you wish to save the whole family from ruin,\nyou must take steps to keep her away from Greshamsbury now at once.\nNow is the time; now that Frank is to be away. Where so much, so very\nmuch depends on a young man's marrying money, not one day ought to be\nlost.\"\n\nInstigated in this manner, Lady Arabella resolved to open her mind\nto the doctor, and to make it intelligible to him that, under\npresent circumstances, Mary's visits at Greshamsbury had better be\ndiscontinued. She would have given much, however, to have escaped\nthis business. She had in her time tried one or two falls with the\ndoctor, and she was conscious that she had never yet got the better\nof him: and then she was in a slight degree afraid of Mary herself.\nShe had a presentiment that it would not be so easy to banish Mary\nfrom Greshamsbury: she was not sure that that young lady would not\nboldly assert her right to her place in the school-room; appeal\nloudly to the squire, and perhaps, declare her determination of\nmarrying the heir, out before them all. The squire would be sure to\nuphold her in that, or in anything else.\n\nAnd then, too, there would be the greatest difficulty in wording her\nrequest to the doctor; and Lady Arabella was sufficiently conscious\nof her own weakness to know that she was not always very good at\nwords. But the doctor, when hard pressed, was never at fault: he\ncould say the bitterest things in the quietest tone, and Lady\nArabella had a great dread of these bitter things. What, also, if he\nshould desert her himself; withdraw from her his skill and knowledge\nof her bodily wants and ailments now that he was so necessary to her?\nShe had once before taken that measure of sending to Barchester for\nDr Fillgrave, but it had answered with her hardly better than with\nSir Roger and Lady Scatcherd.\n\nWhen, therefore, Lady Arabella found herself alone with the doctor,\nand called upon to say out her say in what best language she could\nselect for the occasion, she did not feel to be very much at her ease.\nThere was that about the man before her which cowed her, in spite of\nher being the wife of the squire, the sister of an earl, a person\nquite acknowledged to be of the great world, and the mother of the\nvery important young man whose affections were now about to be called\nin question. Nevertheless, there was the task to be done, and with a\nmother's courage she essayed it.\n\n\"Dr Thorne,\" said she, as soon as their medical conference was at\nan end, \"I am very glad you came over to-day, for I had something\nspecial which I wanted to say to you:\" so far she got, and then\nstopped; but, as the doctor did not seem inclined to give her any\nassistance, she was forced to flounder on as best she could.\n\n\"Something very particular indeed. You know what a respect and\nesteem, and I may say affection, we all have for you,\"--here the\ndoctor made a low bow--\"and I may say for Mary also;\" here the\ndoctor bowed himself again. \"We have done what little we could to be\npleasant neighbours, and I think you'll believe me when I say that I\nam a true friend to you and dear Mary--\"\n\nThe doctor knew that something very unpleasant was coming, but he\ncould not at all guess what might be its nature. He felt, however,\nthat he must say something; so he expressed a hope that he was duly\nsensible of all the acts of kindness he had ever received from the\nsquire and the family at large.\n\n\"I hope, therefore, my dear doctor, you won't take amiss what I am\ngoing to say.\"\n\n\"Well, Lady Arabella, I'll endeavour not to do so.\"\n\n\"I am sure I would not give any pain if I could help it, much less\nto you. But there are occasions, doctor, in which duty must be\nparamount; paramount to all other considerations, you know, and,\ncertainly, this occasion is one of them.\"\n\n\"But what is the occasion, Lady Arabella?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you, doctor. You know what Frank's position is?\"\n\n\"Frank's position! as regards what?\"\n\n\"Why, his position in life; an only son, you know.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; I know his position in that respect; an only son, and his\nfather's heir; and a very fine fellow, he is. You have but one son,\nLady Arabella, and you may well be proud of him.\"\n\nLady Arabella sighed. She did not wish at the present moment to\nexpress herself as being in any way proud of Frank. She was desirous\nrather, on the other hand, of showing that she was a good deal\nashamed of him; only not quite so much ashamed of him as it behoved\nthe doctor to be of his niece.\n\n\"Well, perhaps so; yes,\" said Lady Arabella, \"he is, I believe, a\nvery good young man, with an excellent disposition; but, doctor, his\nposition is very precarious; and he is just at that time of life when\nevery caution is necessary.\"\n\nTo the doctor's ears, Lady Arabella was now talking of her son as a\nmother might of her infant when whooping-cough was abroad or croup\nimminent. \"There is nothing on earth the matter with him, I should\nsay,\" said the doctor. \"He has every possible sign of perfect\nhealth.\"\n\n\"Oh yes; his health! Yes, thank God, his health is good; that is a\ngreat blessing.\" And Lady Arabella thought of her four flowerets that\nhad already faded. \"I am sure I am most thankful to see him growing\nup so strong. But it is not that I mean, doctor.\"\n\n\"Then what is it, Lady Arabella?\"\n\n\"Why, doctor, you know the squire's position with regard to money\nmatters?\"\n\nNow the doctor undoubtedly did know the squire's position with regard\nto money matters,--knew it much better than did Lady Arabella; but\nhe was by no means inclined to talk on that subject to her ladyship.\nHe remained quite silent, therefore, although Lady Arabella's last\nspeech had taken the form of a question. Lady Arabella was a little\noffended at this want of freedom on his part, and become somewhat\nsterner in her tone--a thought less condescending in her manner.\n\n\"The squire has unfortunately embarrassed the property, and Frank\nmust look forward to inherit it with very heavy encumbrances; I\nfear very heavy indeed, though of what exact nature I am kept in\nignorance.\"\n\nLooking at the doctor's face, she perceived that there was no\nprobability whatever that her ignorance would be enlightened by him.\n\n\"And, therefore, it is highly necessary that Frank should be very\ncareful.\"\n\n\"As to his private expenditure, you mean?\" said the doctor.\n\n\"No; not exactly that: though of course he must be careful as to\nthat, too; that's of course. But that is not what I mean, doctor; his\nonly hope of retrieving his circumstances is by marrying money.\"\n\n\"With every other conjugal blessing that a man can have, I hope he\nmay have that also.\" So the doctor replied with imperturbable face;\nbut not the less did he begin to have a shade of suspicion of what\nmight be the coming subject of the conference. It would be untrue to\nsay that he had ever thought it probable that the young heir should\nfall in love with his niece; that he had ever looked forward to such\na chance, either with complacency or with fear; nevertheless, the\nidea had of late passed through his mind. Some word had fallen from\nMary, some closely watched expression of her eye, or some quiver\nin her lip when Frank's name was mentioned, had of late made him\ninvoluntarily think that such might not be impossible; and then, when\nthe chance of Mary becoming the heiress to so large a fortune had\nbeen forced upon his consideration, he had been unable to prevent\nhimself from building happy castles in the air, as he rode slowly\nhome from Boxall Hill. But not a whit the more on that account was\nhe prepared to be untrue to the squire's interest or to encourage a\nfeeling which must be distasteful to all the squire's friends.\n\n\"Yes, doctor; he must marry money.\"\n\n\"And worth, Lady Arabella; and a pure feminine heart; and youth and\nbeauty. I hope he will marry them all.\"\n\nCould it be possible, that in speaking of a pure feminine heart, and\nyouth and beauty, and such like gewgaws, the doctor was thinking of\nhis niece? Could it be that he had absolutely made up his mind to\nfoster and encourage this odious match?\n\nThe bare idea made Lady Arabella wrathful, and her wrath gave her\ncourage. \"He must marry money, or he will be a ruined man. Now,\ndoctor, I am informed that things--words that is--have passed between\nhim and Mary which never ought to have been allowed.\"\n\nAnd now also the doctor was wrathful. \"What things? what words?\" said\nhe, appearing to Lady Arabella as though he rose in his anger nearly\na foot in altitude before her eyes. \"What has passed between them?\nand who says so?\"\n\n\"Doctor, there have been love-makings, you may take my word for it;\nlove-makings of a very, very, very advanced description.\"\n\nThis, the doctor could not stand. No, not for Greshamsbury and its\nheir; not for the squire and all his misfortunes; not for Lady\nArabella and the blood of all the de Courcys could he stand quiet\nand hear Mary thus accused. He sprang up another foot in height, and\nexpanded equally in width as he flung back the insinuation.\n\n\"Who says so? Whoever says so, whoever speaks of Miss Thorne in such\nlanguage, says what is not true. I will pledge my word--\"\n\n\"My dear doctor, my dear doctor, what took place was quite clearly\nheard; there was no mistake about it, indeed.\"\n\n\"What took place? What was heard?\"\n\n\"Well, then, I don't want, you know, to make more of it than can be\nhelped. The thing must be stopped, that is all.\"\n\n\"What thing? Speak out, Lady Arabella. I will not have Mary's conduct\nimpugned by innuendoes. What is it that eavesdroppers have heard?\"\n\n\"Dr Thorne, there have been no eavesdroppers.\"\n\n\"And no talebearers either? Will your ladyship oblige me by letting me\nknow what is the accusation which you bring against my niece?\"\n\n\"There has been most positively an offer made, Dr Thorne.\"\n\n\"And who made it?\"\n\n\"Oh, of course I am not going to say but what Frank must have been\nvery imprudent. Of course he has been to blame. There has been fault\non both sides, no doubt.\"\n\n\"I utterly deny it. I positively deny it. I know nothing of the\ncircumstances; have heard nothing about it--\"\n\n\"Then of course you can't say,\" said Lady Arabella.\n\n\"I know nothing of the circumstance; have heard nothing about it,\"\ncontinued Dr Thorne; \"but I do know my niece, and am ready to assert\nthat there has not been fault on both sides. Whether there has been\nany fault on any side, that I do not yet know.\"\n\n\"I can assure you, Dr Thorne, that an offer was made by Frank;\nsuch an offer cannot be without its allurements to a young lady\ncircumstanced like your niece.\"\n\n\"Allurements!\" almost shouted the doctor, and, as he did so, Lady\nArabella stepped back a pace or two, retreating from the fire which\nshot out of his eyes. \"But the truth is, Lady Arabella, you do not\nknow my niece. If you will have the goodness to let me understand\nwhat it is that you desire I will tell you whether I can comply with\nyour wishes.\"\n\n\"Of course it will be very inexpedient that the young people should\nbe thrown together again;--for the present, I mean.\"\n\n\"Well!\"\n\n\"Frank has now gone to Courcy Castle; and he talks of going from\nthence to Cambridge. But he will doubtless be here, backwards and\nforwards; and perhaps it will be better for all parties--safer,\nthat is, doctor--if Miss Thorne were to discontinue her visits to\nGreshamsbury for a while.\"\n\n\"Very well!\" thundered out the doctor. \"Her visits to Greshamsbury\nshall be discontinued.\"\n\n\"Of course, doctor, this won't change the intercourse between us;\nbetween you and the family.\"\n\n\"Not change it!\" said he. \"Do you think that I will break bread in a\nhouse from whence she has been ignominiously banished? Do you think\nthat I can sit down in friendship with those who have spoken of her\nas you have now spoken? You have many daughters; what would you say\nif I accused one of them as you have accused her?\"\n\n\"Accused, doctor! No, I don't accuse her. But prudence, you know,\ndoes sometimes require us--\"\n\n\"Very well; prudence requires you to look after those who belong\nto you; and prudence requires me to look after my one lamb. Good\nmorning, Lady Arabella.\"\n\n\"But, doctor, you are not going to quarrel with us? You will come\nwhen we want you; eh! won't you?\"\n\nQuarrel! quarrel with Greshamsbury! Angry as he was, the doctor felt\nthat he could ill bear to quarrel with Greshamsbury. A man past fifty\ncannot easily throw over the ties that have taken twenty years to\nform, and wrench himself away from the various close ligatures with\nwhich, in such a period, he has become bound. He could not quarrel\nwith the squire; he could ill bear to quarrel with Frank; though he\nnow began to conceive that Frank had used him badly, he could not do\nso; he could not quarrel with the children, who had almost been born\ninto his arms; nor even with the very walls, and trees, and grassy\nknolls with which he was so dearly intimate. He could not proclaim\nhimself an enemy to Greshamsbury; and yet he felt that fealty to Mary\nrequired of him that, for the present, he should put on an enemy's\nguise.\n\n\"If you want me, Lady Arabella, and send for me, I will come to you;\notherwise I will, if you please, share the sentence which has been\npassed on Mary. I will now wish you good morning.\" And then bowing\nlow to her, he left the room and the house, and sauntered slowly away\nto his own home.\n\nWhat was he to say to Mary? He walked very slowly down the\nGreshamsbury avenue, with his hands clasped behind his back, thinking\nover the whole matter; thinking of it, or rather trying to think\nof it. When a man's heart is warmly concerned in any matter, it\nis almost useless for him to endeavour to think of it. Instead of\nthinking, he gives play to his feelings, and feeds his passion by\nindulging it. \"Allurements!\" he said to himself, repeating Lady\nArabella's words. \"A girl circumstanced like my niece! How utterly\nincapable is such a woman as that to understand the mind, and heart,\nand soul of such a one as Mary Thorne!\" And then his thoughts\nrecurred to Frank. \"It has been ill done of him; ill done of him:\nyoung as he is, he should have had feeling enough to have spared me\nthis. A thoughtless word has been spoken which will now make her\nmiserable!\" And then, as he walked on, he could not divest his mind\nof the remembrance of what had passed between him and Sir Roger.\nWhat, if after all, Mary should become the heiress to all that money?\nWhat, if she should become, in fact, the owner of Greshamsbury? for,\nindeed it seemed too possible that Sir Roger's heir would be the\nowner of Greshamsbury.\n\nThe idea was one which he disliked to entertain, but it would recur\nto him again and again. It might be, that a marriage between his\nniece and the nominal heir to the estate might be of all the matches\nthe best for young Gresham to make. How sweet would be the revenge,\nhow glorious the retaliation on Lady Arabella, if, after what had\nnow been said, it should come to pass that all the difficulties of\nGreshamsbury should be made smooth by Mary's love, and Mary's hand!\nIt was a dangerous subject on which to ponder; and, as he sauntered\ndown the road, the doctor did his best to banish it from his\nmind,--not altogether successfully.\n\nBut as he went he again encountered Beatrice. \"Tell Mary I went to\nher to-day,\" said she, \"and that I expect her up here to-morrow. If\nshe does not come, I shall be savage.\"\n\n\"Do not be savage,\" said he, putting out his hand, \"even though she\nshould not come.\"\n\nBeatrice immediately saw that his manner with her was not playful,\nand that his face was serious. \"I was only in joke,\" said she; \"of\ncourse I was only joking. But is anything the matter? Is Mary ill?\"\n\n\"Oh, no; not ill at all; but she will not be here to-morrow, nor\nprobably for some time. But, Miss Gresham, you must not be savage\nwith her.\"\n\nBeatrice tried to interrogate him, but he would not wait to answer\nher questions. While she was speaking he bowed to her in his usual\nold-fashioned courteous way, and passed on out of hearing. \"She will\nnot come up for some time,\" said Beatrice to herself. \"Then mamma\nmust have quarrelled with her.\" And at once in her heart she\nacquitted her friend of all blame in the matter, whatever it might\nbe, and condemned her mother unheard.\n\nThe doctor, when he arrived at his own house, had in nowise made\nup his mind as to the manner in which he would break the matter to\nMary; but by the time that he had reached the drawing-room, he had\nmade up his mind to this, that he would put off the evil hour till\nthe morrow. He would sleep on the matter--lie awake on it, more\nprobably--and then at breakfast, as best he could, tell her what had\nbeen said of her.\n\nMary that evening was more than usually inclined to be playful.\nShe had not been quite certain till the morning, whether Frank had\nabsolutely left Greshamsbury, and had, therefore, preferred the\ncompany of Miss Oriel to going up to the house. There was a peculiar\ncheerfulness about her friend Patience, a feeling of satisfaction\nwith the world and those in it, which Mary always shared with her;\nand now she had brought home to the doctor's fireside, in spite of\nher young troubles, a smiling face, if not a heart altogether happy.\n\n\"Uncle,\" she said at last, \"what makes you so sombre? Shall I read to\nyou?\"\n\n\"No; not to-night, dearest.\"\n\n\"Why, uncle; what is the matter?\"\n\n\"Nothing, nothing.\"\n\n\"Ah, but it is something, and you shall tell me;\" getting up, she\ncame over to his arm-chair, and leant over his shoulder.\n\nHe looked at her for a minute in silence, and then, getting up from\nhis chair, passed his arm round her waist, and pressed her closely to\nhis heart.\n\n\"My darling!\" he said, almost convulsively. \"My best own, truest\ndarling!\" and Mary, looking up into his face, saw that big tears were\nrunning down his cheeks.\n\nBut still he told her nothing that night.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nCourcy\n\n\nWhen Frank Gresham expressed to his father an opinion that Courcy\nCastle was dull, the squire, as may be remembered, did not pretend to\ndiffer from him. To men such as the squire, and such as the squire's\nson, Courcy Castle was dull. To what class of men it would not be\ndull the author is not prepared to say; but it may be presumed that\nthe de Courcys found it to their liking, or they would have made it\nother than it was.\n\nThe castle itself was a huge brick pile, built in the days of William\nIII, which, though they were grand for days of the construction of\nthe Constitution, were not very grand for architecture of a more\nmaterial description. It had, no doubt, a perfect right to be called\na castle, as it was entered by a castle-gate which led into a court,\nthe porter's lodge for which was built as it were into the wall;\nthere were attached to it also two round, stumpy adjuncts, which\nwere, perhaps properly, called towers, though they did not do much in\nthe way of towering; and, moreover, along one side of the house, over\nwhat would otherwise have been the cornice, there ran a castellated\nparapet, through the assistance of which, the imagination no doubt\nwas intended to supply the muzzles of defiant artillery. But any\nartillery which would have so presented its muzzle must have been\nvery small, and it may be doubted whether even a bowman could have\nobtained shelter there.\n\nThe grounds about the castle were not very inviting, nor, as grounds,\nvery extensive; though, no doubt, the entire domain was such as\nsuited the importance of so puissant a nobleman as Earl de Courcy.\nWhat, indeed, should have been the park was divided out into various\nlarge paddocks. The surface was flat and unbroken; and though\nthere were magnificent elm-trees standing in straight lines, like\nhedgerows, the timber had not that beautiful, wild, scattered look\nwhich generally gives the great charm to English scenery.\n\nThe town of Courcy--for the place claimed to rank as a town--was\nin many particulars like the castle. It was built of dingy-red\nbrick--almost more brown than red--and was solid, dull-looking, ugly\nand comfortable. It consisted of four streets, which were formed by\ntwo roads crossing each other, making at the point of junction a\ncentre for the town. Here stood the Red Lion; had it been called the\nbrown lion, the nomenclature would have been more strictly correct;\nand here, in the old days of coaching, some life had been wont to\nstir itself at those hours in the day and night when the Freetraders,\nTallyhoes, and Royal Mails changed their horses. But now there was a\nrailway station a mile and a half distant, and the moving life of the\ntown of Courcy was confined to the Red Lion omnibus, which seemed to\npass its entire time in going up and down between the town and the\nstation, quite unembarrassed by any great weight of passengers.\n\nThere were, so said the Courcyites when away from Courcy, excellent\nshops in the place; but they were not the less accustomed, when\nat home among themselves, to complain to each other of the vile\nextortion with which they were treated by their neighbours. The\nironmonger, therefore, though he loudly asserted that he could beat\nBristol in the quality of his wares in one direction, and undersell\nGloucester in another, bought his tea and sugar on the sly in one\nof those larger towns; and the grocer, on the other hand, equally\ndistrusted the pots and pans of home production. Trade, therefore, at\nCourcy, had not thriven since the railway had opened: and, indeed,\nhad any patient inquirer stood at the cross through one entire day,\ncounting customers who entered the neighbouring shops, he might well\nhave wondered that any shops in Courcy could be kept open.\n\nAnd how changed has been the bustle of that once noisy inn to the\npresent death-like silence of its green courtyard! There, a lame\nostler crawls about with his hands thrust into the capacious pockets\nof his jacket, feeding on memory. That weary pair of omnibus jades,\nand three sorry posters, are all that now grace those stables where\nhorses used to be stalled in close contiguity by the dozen; where\ntwenty grains apiece, abstracted from every feed of oats consumed\nduring the day, would have afforded a daily quart to the lucky\npilferer.\n\nCome, my friend, and discourse with me. Let us know what are thy\nideas of the inestimable benefits which science has conferred on us\nin these, our latter days. How dost thou, among others, appreciate\nrailways and the power of steam, telegraphs, telegrams, and our new\nexpresses? But indifferently, you say. \"Time was I've zeed vifteen\npair o' 'osses go out of this 'ere yard in vour-and-twenty hour;\nand now there be'ant vifteen, no, not ten, in vour-and-twenty days!\nThere was the duik--not this 'un; he be'ant no gude; but this 'un's\nvather--why, when he'd come down the road, the cattle did be a-going,\nvour days an eend. Here'd be the tooter and the young gen'lmen, and\nthe governess and the young leddies, and then the servants--they'd\nbe al'ays the grandest folk of all--and then the duik and the\ndoochess--Lord love 'ee, zur; the money did fly in them days! But\nnow--\" and the feeling of scorn and contempt which the lame ostler\nwas enabled by his native talent to throw into the word \"now,\" was\nquite as eloquent against the power of steam as anything that has\nbeen spoken at dinners, or written in pamphlets by the keenest\nadmirers of latter-day lights.\n\n\"Why, luke at this 'ere town,\" continued he of the sieve, \"the grass\nbe a-growing in the very streets;--that can't be no gude. Why, luke\n'ee here, zur; I do be a-standing at this 'ere gateway, just this\nway, hour arter hour, and my heyes is hopen mostly;--I zees who's\na-coming and who's a-going. Nobody's a-coming and nobody's a-going;\nthat can't be no gude. Luke at that there homnibus; why, darn me--\"\nand now, in his eloquence at this peculiar point, my friend became\nmore loud and powerful than ever--\"why, darn me, if maister harns\nenough with that there bus to put hiron on them 'osses' feet,\nI'll--be--blowed!\" And as he uttered this hypothetical denunciation\non himself he spoke very slowly, bringing out every word as it were\nseparately, and lowering himself at his knees at every sound, moving\nat the same time his right hand up and down. When he had finished,\nhe fixed his eyes upon the ground, pointing downwards, as if there\nwas to be the site of his doom if the curse that he had called down\nupon himself should ever come to pass; and then, waiting no further\nconverse, he hobbled away, melancholy, to his deserted stables.\n\nOh, my friend! my poor lame friend! it will avail nothing to tell\nthee of Liverpool and Manchester; of the glories of Glasgow, with her\nflourishing banks; of London, with its third millions of inhabitants;\nof the great things which commerce is doing for this nation of thine!\nWhat is commerce to thee, unless it be commerce in posting on that\nworn-out, all but useless great western turnpike-road? There is\nnothing left for thee but to be carted away as rubbish--for thee\nand for many of us in these now prosperous days; oh, my melancholy,\ncare-ridden friend!\n\nCourcy Castle was certainly a dull place to look at, and Frank, in\nhis former visits, had found that the appearance did not belie the\nreality. He had been but little there when the earl had been at\nCourcy; and as he had always felt from his childhood a peculiar\ndistaste to the governance of his aunt the countess, this perhaps may\nhave added to his feeling of dislike. Now, however, the castle was\nto be fuller than he had ever before known it; the earl was to be at\nhome; there was some talk of the Duke of Omnium coming for a day or\ntwo, though that seemed doubtful; there was some faint doubt of Lord\nPorlock; Mr Moffat, intent on the coming election--and also, let us\nhope, on his coming bliss--was to be one of the guests; and there was\nalso to be the great Miss Dunstable.\n\nFrank, however, found that those grandees were not expected quite\nimmediately. \"I might go back to Greshamsbury for three or four days\nas she is not to be here,\" he said na\u00c3\u00afvely to his aunt, expressing,\nwith tolerable perspicuity, his feeling, that he regarded his visit\nto Courcy Castle quite as a matter of business. But the countess\nwould hear of no such arrangement. Now that she had got him, she\nwas not going to let him fall back into the perils of Miss Thorne's\nintrigues, or even of Miss Thorne's propriety. \"It is quite\nessential,\" she said, \"that you should be here a few days before her,\nso that she may see that you are at home.\" Frank did not understand\nthe reasoning; but he felt himself unable to rebel, and he therefore,\nremained there, comforting himself, as best he might, with the\neloquence of the Honourable George, and the sporting humours of the\nHonourable John.\n\nMr Moffat's was the earliest arrival of any importance. Frank had\nnot hitherto made the acquaintance of his future brother-in-law, and\nthere was, therefore, some little interest in the first interview. Mr\nMoffat was shown into the drawing-room before the ladies had gone up\nto dress, and it so happened that Frank was there also. As no one\nelse was in the room but his sister and two of his cousins, he had\nexpected to see the lovers rush into each other's arms. But Mr Moffat\nrestrained his ardour, and Miss Gresham seemed contented that he\nshould do so.\n\nHe was a nice, dapper man, rather above the middle height, and\ngood-looking enough had he had a little more expression in his face.\nHe had dark hair, very nicely brushed, small black whiskers, and a\nsmall black moustache. His boots were excellently well made, and\nhis hands were very white. He simpered gently as he took hold of\nAugusta's fingers, and expressed a hope that she had been quite well\nsince last he had the pleasure of seeing her. Then he touched the\nhands of the Lady Rosina and the Lady Margaretta.\n\n\"Mr Moffat, allow me to introduce you to my brother?\"\n\n\"Most happy, I'm sure,\" said Mr Moffat, again putting out his hand,\nand allowing it to slip through Frank's grasp, as he spoke in a\npretty, mincing voice: \"Lady Arabella quite well?--and your father,\nand sisters? Very warm isn't it?--quite hot in town, I do assure\nyou.\"\n\n\"I hope Augusta likes him,\" said Frank to himself, arguing on the\nsubject exactly as his father had done; \"but for an engaged lover he\nseems to me to have a very queer way with him.\" Frank, poor fellow!\nwho was of a coarser mould, would, under such circumstances, have\nbeen all for kissing--sometimes, indeed, even under other\ncircumstances.\n\nMr Moffat did not do much towards improving the conviviality of\nthe castle. He was, of course, a good deal intent upon his coming\nelection, and spent much of his time with Mr Nearthewinde, the\ncelebrated parliamentary agent. It behoved him to be a good deal\nat Barchester, canvassing the electors and undermining, by Mr\nNearthewinde's aid, the mines for blowing him out of his seat, which\nwere daily being contrived by Mr Closerstil, on behalf of Sir Roger.\nThe battle was to be fought on the internecine principle, no quarter\nbeing given or taken on either side; and of course this gave Mr\nMoffat as much as he knew how to do.\n\nMr Closerstil was well known to be the sharpest man at his business\nin all England, unless the palm should be given to his great rival\nMr Nearthewinde; and in this instance he was to be assisted in the\nbattle by a very clever young barrister, Mr Romer, who was an admirer\nof Sir Roger's career in life. Some people in Barchester, when they\nsaw Sir Roger, Closerstil and Mr Romer saunter down the High Street,\narm in arm, declared that it was all up with poor Moffat; but others,\nin whose head the bump of veneration was strongly pronounced,\nwhispered to each other that great shibboleth--the name of the Duke\nof Omnium--and mildly asserted it to be impossible that the duke's\nnominee should be thrown out.\n\nOur poor friend the squire did not take much interest in the matter,\nexcept in so far that he liked his son-in-law to be in Parliament.\nBoth the candidates were in his eye equally wrong in their opinions.\nHe had long since recanted those errors of his early youth, which\nhad cost him his seat for the county, and had abjured the de Courcy\npolitics. He was staunch enough as a Tory now that his being so would\nno longer be of the slightest use to him; but the Duke of Omnium,\nand Lord de Courcy, and Mr Moffat were all Whigs; Whigs, however,\ndiffering altogether in politics from Sir Roger, who belonged to\nthe Manchester school, and whose pretensions, through some of those\ninscrutable twists in modern politics which are quite unintelligible\nto the minds of ordinary men outside the circle, were on this\noccasion secretly favoured by the high Conservative party.\n\nHow Mr Moffat, who had been brought into the political world by Lord\nde Courcy, obtained all the weight of the duke's interest I never\ncould exactly learn. For the duke and the earl did not generally act\nas twin-brothers on such occasions.\n\nThere is a great difference in Whigs. Lord de Courcy was a Court\nWhig, following the fortunes, and enjoying, when he could get it, the\nsunshine of the throne. He was a sojourner at Windsor, and a visitor\nat Balmoral. He delighted in gold sticks, and was never so happy as\nwhen holding some cap of maintenance or spur of precedence with due\ndignity and acknowledged grace in the presence of all the Court.\nHis means had been somewhat embarrassed by early extravagance; and,\ntherefore, as it was to his taste to shine, it suited him to shine at\nthe cost of the Court rather than at his own.\n\nThe Duke of Omnium was a Whig of a very different calibre. He rarely\nwent near the presence of majesty, and when he did do so, he did it\nmerely as a disagreeable duty incident to his position. He was very\nwilling that the Queen should be queen so long as he was allowed to\nbe Duke of Omnium. Nor had he begrudged Prince Albert any of his\nhonours till he was called Prince Consort. Then, indeed, he had,\nto his own intimate friends, made some remark in three words, not\nflattering to the discretion of the Prime Minister. The Queen might\nbe queen so long as he was Duke of Omnium. Their revenues were\nabout the same, with the exception, that the duke's were his own,\nand he could do what he liked with them. This remembrance did not\nunfrequently present itself to the duke's mind. In person, he was a\nplain, thin man, tall, but undistinguished in appearance, except that\nthere was a gleam of pride in his eye which seemed every moment to be\nsaying, \"I am the Duke of Omnium.\" He was unmarried, and, if report\nsaid true, a great debauchee; but if so he had always kept his\ndebaucheries decently away from the eyes of the world, and was not,\ntherefore, open to that loud condemnation which should fall like a\nhailstorm round the ears of some more open sinners.\n\nWhy these two mighty nobles put their heads together in order that\nthe tailor's son should represent Barchester in Parliament, I cannot\nexplain. Mr Moffat, was, as has been said, Lord de Courcy's friend;\nand it may be that Lord de Courcy was able to repay the duke for his\nkindness, as touching Barchester, with some little assistance in the\ncounty representation.\n\nThe next arrival was that of the Bishop of Barchester; a meek, good,\nworthy man, much attached to his wife, and somewhat addicted to his\nease. She, apparently, was made in a different mould, and by her\nenergy and diligence atoned for any want in those qualities which\nmight be observed in the bishop himself. When asked his opinion, his\nlordship would generally reply by saying--\"Mrs Proudie and I think so\nand so.\" But before that opinion was given, Mrs Proudie would take\nup the tale, and she, in her more concise manner, was not wont to\nquote the bishop as having at all assisted in the consideration of\nthe subject. It was well known in Barsetshire that no married pair\nconsorted more closely or more tenderly together; and the example of\nsuch conjugal affection among persons in the upper classes is worth\nmentioning, as it is believed by those below them, and too often with\ntruth, that the sweet bliss of connubial reciprocity is not so common\nas it should be among the magnates of the earth.\n\nBut the arrival even of the bishop and his wife did not make the\nplace cheerful to Frank Gresham, and he began to long for Miss\nDunstable, in order that he might have something to do. He could not\nget on at all with Mr Moffat. He had expected that the man would at\nonce have called him Frank, and that he would have called the man\nGustavus; but they did not even get beyond Mr Moffat and Mr Gresham.\n\"Very hot in Barchester to-day, very,\" was the nearest approach to\nconversation which Frank could attain with him; and as far as he,\nFrank, could see, Augusta never got much beyond it. There might be\n_t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aate_ meetings between them, but, if so, Frank could not\ndetect when they took place; and so, opening his heart at last to the\nHonourable George, for the want of a better confidant, he expressed\nhis opinion that his future brother-in-law was a muff.\n\n\"A muff--I believe you too. What do you think now? I have been with\nhim and Nearthewinde in Barchester these three days past, looking up\nthe electors' wives and daughters, and that kind of thing.\"\n\n\"I say, if there is any fun in it you might as well take me with\nyou.\"\n\n\"Oh, there is not much fun; they are mostly so slobbered and dirty. A\nsharp fellow in Nearthewinde, and knows what he is about well.\"\n\n\"Does he look up the wives and daughters too?\"\n\n\"Oh, he goes on every tack, just as it's wanted. But there was\nMoffat, yesterday, in a room behind the milliner's shop near\nCuthbert's Gate; I was with him. The woman's husband is one of the\nchoristers and an elector, you know, and Moffat went to look for his\nvote. Now, there was no one there when we got there but the three\nyoung women, the wife, that is, and her two girls--very pretty women\nthey are too.\"\n\n\"I say, George, I'll go and get the chorister's vote for Moffat; I\nought to do it as he's to be my brother-in-law.\"\n\n\"But what do you think Moffat said to the women?\"\n\n\"Can't guess--he didn't kiss any of them, did he?\"\n\n\"Kiss any of them? No; but he begged to give them his positive\nassurance as a gentleman, that if he was returned to Parliament he\nwould vote for an extension of the franchise, and the admission of\nthe Jews into Parliament.\"\n\n\"Well, he is a muff!\" said Frank.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nMiss Dunstable\n\n\nAt last the great Miss Dunstable came. Frank, when he heard that\nthe heiress had arrived, felt some slight palpitation at his heart.\nHe had not the remotest idea in the world of marrying her; indeed,\nduring the last week past, absence had so heightened his love for\nMary Thorne that he was more than ever resolved that he would never\nmarry any one but her. He knew that he had made her a formal offer\nfor her hand, and that it behoved him to keep to it, let the charms\nof Miss Dunstable be what they might; but, nevertheless, he was\nprepared to go through a certain amount of courtship, in obedience\nto his aunt's behests, and he felt a little nervous at being brought\nup in that way, face to face, to do battle with two hundred thousand\npounds.\n\n\"Miss Dunstable has arrived,\" said his aunt to him, with great\ncomplacency, on his return from an electioneering visit to the\nbeauties of Barchester which he made with his cousin George on the\nday after the conversation which was repeated at the end of the last\nchapter. \"She has arrived, and is looking remarkably well; she has\nquite a _distingu\u00c3\u00a9_ air, and will grace any circle to which she may\nbe introduced. I will introduce you before dinner, and you can take\nher out.\"\n\n\"I couldn't propose to her to-night, I suppose?\" said Frank,\nmaliciously.\n\n\"Don't talk nonsense, Frank,\" said the countess, angrily. \"I am doing\nwhat I can for you, and taking on an infinity of trouble to endeavour\nto place you in an independent position; and now you talk nonsense to\nme.\"\n\nFrank muttered some sort of apology, and then went to prepare himself\nfor the encounter.\n\nMiss Dunstable, though she had come by train, had brought with her\nher own carriage, her own horses, her own coachman and footman, and\nher own maid, of course. She had also brought with her half a score\nof trunks, full of wearing apparel; some of them nearly as rich as\nthat wonderful box which was stolen a short time since from the top\nof a cab. But she brought all these things, not in the least because\nshe wanted them herself, but because she had been instructed to do\nso.\n\nFrank was a little more than ordinarily careful in dressing. He\nspoilt a couple of white neckties before he was satisfied, and was\nrather fastidious as the set of his hair. There was not much of the\ndandy about him in the ordinary meaning of the word; but he felt that\nit was incumbent on him to look his best, seeing what it was expected\nthat he should now do. He certainly did not mean to marry Miss\nDunstable; but as he was to have a flirtation with her, it was well\nthat he should do so under the best possible auspices.\n\nWhen he entered the drawing-room he perceived at once that the lady\nwas there. She was seated between the countess and Mrs Proudie; and\nmammon, in her person, was receiving worship from the temporalities\nand spiritualities of the land. He tried to look unconcerned, and\nremained in the farther part of the room, talking with some of his\ncousins; but he could not keep his eye off the future possible Mrs\nFrank Gresham; and it seemed as though she was as much constrained to\nscrutinise him as he felt to scrutinise her.\n\nLady de Courcy had declared that she was looking extremely well, and\nhad particularly alluded to her _distingu\u00c3\u00a9_ appearance. Frank at once\nfelt that he could not altogether go along with his aunt in this\nopinion. Miss Dunstable might be very well; but her style of beauty\nwas one which did not quite meet with his warmest admiration.\n\nIn age she was about thirty; but Frank, who was no great judge in\nthese matters, and who was accustomed to have very young girls round\nhim, at once put her down as being ten years older. She had a very\nhigh colour, very red cheeks, a large mouth, big white teeth, a broad\nnose, and bright, small, black eyes. Her hair also was black and\nbright, but very crisp, and strong, and was combed close round her\nface in small crisp black ringlets. Since she had been brought out\ninto the fashionable world some one of her instructors in fashion\nhad given her to understand that curls were not the thing. \"They'll\nalways pass muster,\" Miss Dunstable had replied, \"when they are done\nup with bank-notes.\" It may therefore be presumed that Miss Dunstable\nhad a will of her own.\n\n\"Frank,\" said the countess, in the most natural and unpremeditated\nway, as soon as she caught her nephew's eye, \"come here. I want to\nintroduce you to Miss Dunstable.\" The introduction was then made.\n\"Mrs Proudie, would you excuse me? I must positively go and say a few\nwords to Mrs Barlow, or the poor woman will feel herself huffed;\"\nand, so saying, she moved off, leaving the coast clear for Master\nFrank.\n\nHe of course slipped into his aunt's place, and expressed a hope that\nMiss Dunstable was not fatigued by her journey.\n\n\"Fatigued!\" said she, in a voice rather loud, but very good-humoured,\nand not altogether unpleasing; \"I am not to be fatigued by such a\nthing as that. Why, in May we came through all the way from Rome to\nParis without sleeping--that is, without sleeping in a bed--and we\nwere upset three times out of the sledges coming over the Simplon. It\nwas such fun! Why, I wasn't to say tired even then.\"\n\n\"All the way from Rome to Paris!\" said Mrs Proudie--in a tone of\nastonishment, meant to flatter the heiress--\"and what made you in\nsuch a hurry?\"\n\n\"Something about money matters,\" said Miss Dunstable, speaking rather\nlouder than usual. \"Something to do with the ointment. I was selling\nthe business just then.\"\n\nMrs Proudie bowed, and immediately changed the conversation.\n\"Idolatry is, I believe, more rampant than ever in Rome,\" said she;\n\"and I fear there is no such thing at all as Sabbath observance.\"\n\n\"Oh, not in the least,\" said Miss Dunstable, with rather a joyous\nair; \"Sundays and week-days are all the same there.\"\n\n\"How very frightful!\" said Mrs Proudie.\n\n\"But it's a delicious place. I do like Rome, I must say. And as for\nthe Pope, if he wasn't quite so fat he would be the nicest old fellow\nin the world. Have you been in Rome, Mrs Proudie?\"\n\nMrs Proudie sighed as she replied in the negative, and declared her\nbelief that danger was to be apprehended from such visits.\n\n\"Oh!--ah!--the malaria--of course--yes; if you go at the wrong time;\nbut nobody is such a fool as that now.\"\n\n\"I was thinking of the soul, Miss Dunstable,\" said the lady-bishop,\nin her peculiar, grave tone. \"A place where there are no Sabbath\nobservances--\"\n\n\"And have you been in Rome, Mr Gresham?\" said the young lady, turning\nalmost abruptly round to Frank, and giving a somewhat uncivilly cold\nshoulder to Mrs Proudie's exhortation. She, poor lady, was forced to\nfinish her speech to the Honourable George, who was standing near to\nher. He having an idea that bishops and all their belongings, like\nother things appertaining to religion, should, if possible, be\navoided; but if that were not possible, should be treated with\nmuch assumed gravity, immediately put on a long face, and remarked\nthat--\"it was a deuced shame: for his part he always liked to see\npeople go quiet on Sundays. The parsons had only one day out of\nseven, and he thought they were fully entitled to that.\" Satisfied\nwith which, or not satisfied, Mrs Proudie had to remain silent till\ndinner-time.\n\n\"No,\" said Frank; \"I never was in Rome. I was in Paris once, and\nthat's all.\" And then, feeling a not unnatural anxiety as to the\npresent state of Miss Dunstable's worldly concerns, he took an\nopportunity of falling back on that part of the conversation which\nMrs Proudie had exercised so much tact in avoiding.\n\n\"And was it sold?\" said he.\n\n\"Sold! what sold?\"\n\n\"You were saying about the business--that you came back without going\nto bed because of selling the business.\"\n\n\"Oh!--the ointment. No; it was not sold. After all, the affair did\nnot come off, and I might have remained and had another roll in the\nsnow. Wasn't it a pity?\"\n\n\"So,\" said Frank to himself, \"if I should do it, I should be owner of\nthe ointment of Lebanon: how odd!\" And then he gave her his arm and\nhanded her down to dinner.\n\nHe certainly found that the dinner was less dull than any other he\nhad sat down to at Courcy Castle. He did not fancy that he should\never fall in love with Miss Dunstable; but she certainly was an\nagreeable companion. She told him of her tour, and the fun she had in\nher journeys; how she took a physician with her for the benefit of\nher health, whom she generally was forced to nurse; of the trouble it\nwas to her to look after and wait upon her numerous servants; of the\ntricks she played to bamboozle people who came to stare at her; and,\nlastly, she told him of a lover who followed her from country to\ncountry, and was now in hot pursuit of her, having arrived in London\nthe evening before she left.\n\n\"A lover?\" said Frank, somewhat startled by the suddenness of the\nconfidence.\n\n\"A lover--yes--Mr Gresham; why should I not have a lover?\"\n\n\"Oh!--no--of course not. I dare say you have a good many.\"\n\n\"Only three or four, upon my word; that is, only three or four that I\nfavour. One is not bound to reckon the others, you know.\"\n\n\"No, they'd be too numerous. And so you have three whom you favour,\nMiss Dunstable;\" and Frank sighed, as though he intended to say that\nthe number was too many for his peace of mind.\n\n\"Is not that quite enough? But of course I change them sometimes;\"\nand she smiled on him very good-naturedly. \"It would be very dull if\nI were always to keep the same.\"\n\n\"Very dull indeed,\" said Frank, who did not quite know what to say.\n\n\"Do you think the countess would mind my having one or two of them\nhere if I were to ask her?\"\n\n\"I am quite sure she would,\" said Frank, very briskly. \"She would not\napprove of it at all; nor should I.\"\n\n\"You--why, what have you to do with it?\"\n\n\"A great deal--so much so that I positively forbid it; but, Miss\nDunstable--\"\n\n\"Well, Mr Gresham?\"\n\n\"We will contrive to make up for the deficiency as well as possible,\nif you will permit us to do so. Now for myself--\"\n\n\"Well, for yourself?\"\n\nAt this moment the countess gleamed her accomplished eye round the\ntable, and Miss Dunstable rose from her chair as Frank was preparing\nhis attack, and accompanied the other ladies into the drawing-room.\n\nHis aunt, as she passed him, touched his arm lightly with her fan, so\nlightly that the action was perceived by no one else. But Frank well\nunderstood the meaning of the touch, and appreciated the approbation\nwhich it conveyed. He merely blushed, however, at his own\ndissimulation; for he felt more certain that ever that he would never\nmarry Miss Dunstable, and he felt nearly equally sure that Miss\nDunstable would never marry him.\n\nLord de Courcy was now at home; but his presence did not add much\nhilarity to the claret-cup. The young men, however, were very keen\nabout the election, and Mr Nearthewinde, who was one of the party,\nwas full of the most sanguine hopes.\n\n\"I have done one good at any rate,\" said Frank; \"I have secured the\nchorister's vote.\"\n\n\"What! Bagley?\" said Nearthewinde. \"The fellow kept out of my way,\nand I couldn't see him.\"\n\n\"I haven't exactly seen him,\" said Frank; \"but I've got his vote all\nthe same.\"\n\n\"What! by a letter?\" said Mr Moffat.\n\n\"No, not by letter,\" said Frank, speaking rather low as he looked at\nthe bishop and the earl; \"I got a promise from his wife: I think he's\na little in the henpecked line.\"\n\n\"Ha--ha--ha!\" laughed the good bishop, who, in spite of Frank's\nmodulation of voice, had overheard what had passed. \"Is that the way\nyou manage electioneering matters in our cathedral city? Ha--ha--ha!\"\nThe idea of one of his choristers being in the henpecked line was\nvery amusing to the bishop.\n\n\"Oh, I got a distinct promise,\" said Frank, in his pride; and then\nadded incautiously, \"but I had to order bonnets for the whole\nfamily.\"\n\n\"Hush-h-h-h-h!\" said Mr Nearthewinde, absolutely flabbergasted by\nsuch imprudence on the part of one of his client's friends. \"I am\nquite sure that your order had no effect, and was intended to have no\neffect on Mr Bagley's vote.\"\n\n\"Is that wrong?\" said Frank; \"upon my word I thought that it was\nquite legitimate.\"\n\n\"One should never admit anything in electioneering matters, should\none?\" said George, turning to Mr Nearthewinde.\n\n\"Very little, Mr de Courcy; very little indeed--the less the better.\nIt's hard to say in these days what is wrong and what is not. Now,\nthere's Reddypalm, the publican, the man who has the Brown Bear.\nWell, I was there, of course: he's a voter, and if any man in\nBarchester ought to feel himself bound to vote for a friend of the\nduke's, he ought. Now, I was so thirsty when I was in that man's\nhouse that I was dying for a glass of beer; but for the life of me I\ndidn't dare order one.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" said Frank, whose mind was only just beginning to be\nenlightened by the great doctrine of purity of election as practised\nin English provincial towns.\n\n\"Oh, Closerstil had some fellow looking at me; why, I can't walk down\nthat town without having my very steps counted. I like sharp fighting\nmyself, but I never go so sharp as that.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless I got Bagley's vote,\" said Frank, persisting in praise\nof his own electioneering prowess; \"and you may be sure of this, Mr\nNearthewinde, none of Closerstil's men were looking at me when I got\nit.\"\n\n\"Who'll pay for the bonnets, Frank?\" said George.\n\n\"Oh, I'll pay for them if Moffat won't. I think I shall keep an\naccount there; they seem to have good gloves and those sort of\nthings.\"\n\n\"Very good, I have no doubt,\" said George.\n\n\"I suppose your lordship will be in town soon after the meeting of\nParliament?\" said the bishop, questioning the earl.\n\n\"Oh! yes; I suppose I must be there. I am never allowed to remain\nvery long in quiet. It is a great nuisance; but it is too late to\nthink of that now.\"\n\n\"Men in high places, my lord, never were, and never will be, allowed\nto consider themselves. They burn their torches not in their own\nbehalf,\" said the bishop, thinking, perhaps, as much of himself as he\ndid of his noble friend. \"Rest and quiet are the comforts of those\nwho have been content to remain in obscurity.\"\n\n\"Perhaps so,\" said the earl, finishing his glass of claret with\nan air of virtuous resignation. \"Perhaps so.\" His own martyrdom,\nhowever, had not been severe, for the rest and quiet of home had\nnever been peculiarly satisfactory to his tastes. Soon after this\nthey all went to the ladies.\n\nIt was some little time before Frank could find an opportunity of\nrecommencing his allotted task with Miss Dunstable. She got into\nconversation with the bishop and some other people, and, except that\nhe took her teacup and nearly managed to squeeze one of her fingers\nas he did so, he made very little further progress till towards the\nclose of the evening.\n\nAt last he found her so nearly alone as to admit of his speaking to\nher in his low confidential voice.\n\n\"Have you managed that matter with my aunt?\"\n\n\"What matter?\" said Miss Dunstable; and her voice was not low, nor\nparticularly confidential.\n\n\"About those three or four gentlemen whom you wish to invite here?\"\n\n\"Oh! my attendant knights! no, indeed; you gave me such very slight\nhope of success; besides, you said something about my not wanting\nthem.\"\n\n\"Yes I did; I really think they'd be quite unnecessary. If you should\nwant any one to defend you--\"\n\n\"At these coming elections, for instance.\"\n\n\"Then, or at any other time, there are plenty here who will be ready\nto stand up for you.\"\n\n\"Plenty! I don't want plenty: one good lance in the olden days was\nalways worth more than a score of ordinary men-at-arms.\"\n\n\"But you talked about three or four.\"\n\n\"Yes; but then you see, Mr Gresham, I have never yet found the one\ngood lance--at least, not good enough to suit my ideas of true\nprowess.\"\n\nWhat could Frank do but declare that he was ready to lay his own in\nrest, now and always in her behalf? His aunt had been quite angry\nwith him, and had thought that he turned her into ridicule, when he\nspoke of making an offer to her guest that very evening; and yet here\nhe was so placed that he had hardly an alternative. Let his inward\nresolution to abjure the heiress be ever so strong, he was now in a\nposition which allowed him no choice in the matter. Even Mary Thorne\ncould hardly have blamed him for saying, that so far as his own\nprowess went, it was quite at Miss Dunstable's service. Had Mary been\nlooking on, she, perhaps, might have thought that he could have done\nso with less of that look of devotion which he threw into his eyes.\n\n\"Well, Mr Gresham, that's very civil--very civil indeed,\" said Miss\nDunstable. \"Upon my word, if a lady wanted a true knight she might\ndo worse than trust to you. Only I fear that your courage is of so\nexalted a nature that you would be ever ready to do battle for any\nbeauty who might be in distress--or, indeed, who might not. You could\nnever confine your valour to the protection of one maiden.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes! but I would though if I liked her,\" said Frank. \"There\nisn't a more constant fellow in the world than I am in that way--you\ntry me, Miss Dunstable.\"\n\n\"When young ladies make such trials as that, they sometimes find it\ntoo late to go back if the trial doesn't succeed, Mr Gresham.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course there's always some risk. It's like hunting; there\nwould be no fun if there was no danger.\"\n\n\"But if you get a tumble one day you can retrieve your honour the\nnext; but a poor girl, if she once trusts a man who says that he\nloves her, has no such chance. For myself, I would never listen to a\nman unless I'd known him for seven years at least.\"\n\n\"Seven years!\" said Frank, who could not help thinking that in seven\nyears' time Miss Dunstable would be almost an old woman. \"Seven days\nis enough to know any person.\"\n\n\"Or perhaps seven hours; eh, Mr Gresham?\"\n\n\"Seven hours--well, perhaps seven hours, if they happen to be a good\ndeal together during the time.\"\n\n\"There's nothing after all like love at first sight, is there, Mr\nGresham?\"\n\nFrank knew well enough that she was quizzing him, and could not\nresist the temptation he felt to be revenged on her. \"I am sure it's\nvery pleasant,\" said he; \"but as for myself, I have never experienced\nit.\"\n\n\"Ha, ha, ha!\" laughed Miss Dunstable. \"Upon my word, Mr Gresham, I\nlike you amazingly. I didn't expect to meet anybody down here that\nI should like half so much. You must come and see me in London, and\nI'll introduce you to my three knights,\" and so saying, she moved\naway and fell into conversation with some of the higher powers.\n\nFrank felt himself to be rather snubbed, in spite of the strong\nexpression which Miss Dunstable had made in his favour. It was not\nquite clear to him that she did not take him for a boy. He was, to be\nsure, avenged on her for that by taking her for a middle-aged woman;\nbut, nevertheless, he was hardly satisfied with himself; \"I might\ngive her a heartache yet,\" said he to himself, \"and she might find\nafterwards that she was left in the lurch with all her money.\" And\nso he retired, solitary, into a far part of the room, and began to\nthink of Mary Thorne. As he did so, and as his eyes fell upon Miss\nDunstable's stiff curls, he almost shuddered.\n\nAnd then the ladies retired. His aunt, with a good-natured smile on\nher face, come to him as she was leaving the room, the last of the\nbevy, and putting her hand on his arm, led him out into a small\nunoccupied chamber which opened from the grand saloon.\n\n\"Upon my word, Master Frank,\" said she, \"you seem to be losing no\ntime with the heiress. You have quite made an impression already.\"\n\n\"I don't know much about that, aunt,\" said he, looking rather\nsheepish.\n\n\"Oh, I declare you have; but, Frank, my dear boy, you should not\nprecipitate these sort of things too much. It is well to take a\nlittle more time: it is more valued; and perhaps, you know, on the\nwhole--\"\n\nPerhaps Frank might know; but it was clear that Lady de Courcy did\nnot: at any rate, she did not know how to express herself. Had she\nsaid out her mind plainly, she would probably have spoken thus: \"I\nwant you to make love to Miss Dunstable, certainly; or at any rate to\nmake an offer to her; but you need not make a show of yourself and of\nher, too, by doing it so openly as all that.\" The countess, however,\ndid not want to reprimand her obedient nephew, and therefore did not\nspeak out her thoughts.\n\n\"Well?\" said Frank, looking up into her face.\n\n\"Take a _leetle_ more time--that is all, my dear boy; slow and sure,\nyou know;\" so the countess again patted his arm and went away to bed.\n\n\"Old fool!\" muttered Frank to himself, as he returned to the room\nwhere the men were still standing. He was right in this: she was an\nold fool, or she would have seen that there was no chance whatever\nthat her nephew and Miss Dunstable should become man and wife.\n\n\"Well Frank,\" said the Honourable John; \"so you're after the heiress\nalready.\"\n\n\"He won't give any of us a chance,\" said the Honourable George.\n\"If he goes on in that way she'll be Mrs Gresham before a month is\nover. But, Frank, what will she say of your manner of looking for\nBarchester votes?\"\n\n\"Mr Gresham is certainly an excellent hand at canvassing,\" said Mr\nNearthewinde; \"only a little too open in his manner of proceeding.\"\n\n\"I got that chorister for you at any rate,\" said Frank. \"And you\nwould never have had him without me.\"\n\n\"I don't think half so much of the chorister's vote as that of Miss\nDunstable,\" said the Honourable George: \"that's the interest that is\nreally worth looking after.\"\n\n\"But, surely,\" said Mr Moffat, \"Miss Dunstable has no property in\nBarchester?\" Poor man! his heart was so intent on his election that\nhe had not a moment to devote to the claims of love.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nThe Election\n\n\nAnd now the important day of the election had arrived, and some men's\nhearts beat quickly enough. To be or not to be a member of the British\nParliament is a question of very considerable moment in a man's mind.\nMuch is often said of the great penalties which the ambitious pay for\nenjoying this honour; of the tremendous expenses of elections; of the\nlong, tedious hours of unpaid labour: of the weary days passed in the\nHouse; but, nevertheless, the prize is one very well worth the price\npaid for it--well worth any price that can be paid for it short of\nwading through dirt and dishonour.\n\nNo other great European nation has anything like it to offer to the\nambition of its citizens; for in no other great country of Europe,\nnot even in those which are free, has the popular constitution\nobtained, as with us, true sovereignty and power of rule. Here it is\nso; and when a man lays himself out to be a member of Parliament, he\nplays the highest game and for the highest stakes which the country\naffords.\n\nTo some men, born silver-spooned, a seat in Parliament comes as\na matter of course. From the time of their early manhood they\nhardly know what it is not to sit there; and the honour is hardly\nappreciated, being too much a matter of course. As a rule, they\nnever know how great a thing it is to be in Parliament; though, when\nreverse comes, as reverses occasionally will come, they fully feel\nhow dreadful it is to be left out.\n\nBut to men aspiring to be members, or to those who having been\nonce fortunate have again to fight the battle without assurance of\nsuccess, the coming election must be matter of dread concern. Oh, how\ndelightful to hear that the long-talked-of rival has declined the\ncontest, and that the course is clear! or to find by a short canvass\nthat one's majority is safe, and the pleasures of crowing over an\nunlucky, friendless foe quite secured!\n\nNo such gratification as this filled the bosom of Mr Moffat on\nthe morning of the Barchester election. To him had been brought\nno positive assurance of success by his indefatigable agent, Mr\nNearthewinde. It was admitted on all sides that the contest would be\na very close one; and Mr Nearthewinde would not do more than assert\nthat they ought to win unless things went very wrong with them.\n\nMr Nearthewinde had other elections to attend to, and had not been\nremaining at Courcy Castle ever since the coming of Miss Dunstable:\nbut he had been there, and at Barchester, as often as possible, and\nMr Moffat was made greatly uneasy by reflecting how very high the\nbill would be.\n\nThe two parties had outdone each other in the loudness of their\nassertions, that each would on his side conduct the election in\nstrict conformity to law. There was to be no bribery. Bribery! who,\nindeed, in these days would dare to bribe; to give absolute money for\nan absolute vote, and pay for such an article in downright palpable\nsovereigns? No. Purity was much too rampant for that, and the means\nof detection too well understood. But purity was to be carried much\nfurther than this. There should be no treating; no hiring of two\nhundred voters to act as messengers at twenty shillings a day in\nlooking up some four hundred other voters; no bands were to be paid\nfor; no carriages furnished; no ribbons supplied. British voters were\nto vote, if vote they would, for the love and respect they bore to\ntheir chosen candidate. If so actuated, they would not vote, they\nmight stay away; no other inducement would be offered.\n\nSo much was said loudly--very loudly--by each party; but,\nnevertheless, Mr Moffat, early in these election days, began to have\nsome misgivings about the bill. The proclaimed arrangement had been\none exactly suitable to his taste; for Mr Moffat loved his money. He\nwas a man in whose breast the ambition of being great in the world,\nand of joining himself to aristocratic people was continually at war\nwith the great cost which such tastes occasioned. His last election\nhad not been a cheap triumph. In one way or another money had\nbeen dragged from him for purposes which had been to his mind\nunintelligible; and when, about the middle of his first session, he\nhad, with much grumbling, settled all demands, he had questioned with\nhimself whether his whistle was worth its cost.\n\nHe was therefore a great stickler for purity of election; although,\nhad he considered the matter, he should have known that with him\nmoney was his only passport into that Elysium in which he had now\nlived for two years. He probably did not consider it; for when, in\nthose canvassing days immediately preceding the election, he had\nseen that all the beer-houses were open, and half the population\nwas drunk, he had asked Mr Nearthewinde whether this violation of\nthe treaty was taking place only on the part of his opponent, and\nwhether, in such case, it would not be duly noticed with a view to a\npossible future petition.\n\nMr Nearthewinde assured him triumphantly that half at least of the\nwallowing swine were his own especial friends; and that somewhat\nmore than half of the publicans of the town were eagerly engaged in\nfighting his, Mr Moffat's battle. Mr Moffat groaned, and would have\nexpostulated had Mr Nearthewinde been willing to hear him. But that\ngentleman's services had been put into requisition by Lord de Courcy\nrather than by the candidate. For the candidate he cared but little.\nTo pay the bill would be enough for him. He, Mr Nearthewinde, was\ndoing his business as he well knew how to do it; and it was not\nlikely that he should submit to be lectured by such as Mr Moffat on a\ntrumpery score of expense.\n\nIt certainly did appear on the morning of the election as though some\ngreat change had been made in that resolution of the candidates to be\nvery pure. From an early hour rough bands of music were to be heard\nin every part of the usually quiet town; carts and gigs, omnibuses\nand flys, all the old carriages from all the inn-yards, and every\nvehicle of any description which could be pressed into the service\nwere in motion; if the horses and post-boys were not to be paid for\nby the candidates, the voters themselves were certainly very liberal\nin their mode of bringing themselves to the poll. The election\ndistrict of the city of Barchester extended for some miles on each\nside of the city, so that the omnibuses and flys had enough to do.\nBeer was to be had at the public-houses, almost without question, by\nall who chose to ask for it; and rum and brandy were dispensed to\nselect circles within the bars with equal profusion. As for ribbons,\nthe mercers' shops must have been emptied of that article, as far as\nscarlet and yellow were concerned. Scarlet was Sir Roger's colour,\nwhile the friends of Mr Moffat were decked with yellow. Seeing what\nhe did see, Mr Moffat might well ask whether there had not been a\nviolation of the treaty of purity!\n\nAt the time of this election there was some question whether England\nshould go to war with all her energy; or whether it would not be\nbetter for her to save her breath to cool her porridge, and not\nmeddle more than could be helped with foreign quarrels. The last view\nof the matter was advocated by Sir Roger, and his motto of course\nproclaimed the merits of domestic peace and quiet. \"Peace abroad and\na big loaf at home,\" was consequently displayed on four or five huge\nscarlet banners, and carried waving over the heads of the people. But\nMr Moffat was a staunch supporter of the Government, who were already\ninclined to be belligerent, and \"England's honour\" was therefore the\nlegend under which he selected to do battle. It may, however, be\ndoubted whether there was in all Barchester one inhabitant--let alone\none elector--so fatuous as to suppose that England's honour was in\nany special manner dear to Mr Moffat; or that he would be a whit more\nsure of a big loaf than he was now, should Sir Roger happily become a\nmember of the legislature.\n\nAnd then the fine arts were resorted to, seeing that language fell\nshort in telling all that was found necessary to be told. Poor Sir\nRoger's failing as regards the bottle was too well known; and it was\nalso known that, in acquiring his title, he had not quite laid aside\nthe rough mode of speech which he had used in his early years. There\nwas, consequently, a great daub painted up on sundry walls, on which\na navvy, with a pimply, bloated face, was to be seen standing on a\nrailway bank, leaning on a spade holding a bottle in one hand, while\nhe invited a comrade to drink. \"Come, Jack, shall us have a drop of\nsome'at short?\" were the words coming out of the navvy's mouth; and\nunder this was painted in huge letters,\n\n\n   \"THE LAST NEW BARONET.\"\n\n\nBut Mr Moffat hardly escaped on easier terms. The trade by which his\nfather had made his money was as well known as that of the railway\ncontractor; and every possible symbol of tailordom was displayed in\ngraphic portraiture on the walls and hoardings of the city. He was\ndrawn with his goose, with his scissors, with his needle, with his\ntapes; he might be seen measuring, cutting, stitching, pressing,\ncarrying home his bundle, and presenting his little bill; and under\neach of these representations was repeated his own motto: \"England's\nhonour.\"\n\nSuch were the pleasant little amenities with which the people of\nBarchester greeted the two candidates who were desirous of the honour\nof serving them in Parliament.\n\nThe polling went on briskly and merrily. There were somewhat above\nnine hundred registered voters, of whom the greater portion recorded\ntheir votes early in the day. At two o'clock, according to Sir\nRoger's committee, the numbers were as follows:--\n\n\n   Scatcherd    275\n   Moffat       268\n\n\nWhereas, by the light afforded by Mr Moffat's people, they stood in a\nslightly different ratio to each other, being written thus:--\n\n\n   Moffat       277\n   Scatcherd    269\n\n\nThis naturally heightened the excitement, and gave additional delight\nto the proceedings. At half-past two it was agreed by both sides that\nMr Moffat was ahead; the Moffatites claiming a majority of twelve,\nand the Scatcherdites allowing a majority of one. But by three\no'clock sundry good men and true, belonging to the railway interest,\nhad made their way to the booth in spite of the efforts of a band\nof roughs from Courcy, and Sir Roger was again leading, by ten or a\ndozen, according to his own showing.\n\nOne little transaction which took place in the earlier part of the\nday deserves to be recorded. There was in Barchester an honest\npublican--honest as the world of publicans goes--who not only was\npossessed of a vote, but possessed also of a son who was a voter.\nHe was one Reddypalm, and in former days, before he had learned to\nappreciate the full value of an Englishman's franchise, he had been a\ndeclared Liberal and an early friend of Roger Scatcherd's. In latter\ndays he had governed his political feelings with more decorum, and\nhad not allowed himself to be carried away by such foolish fervour as\nhe had evinced in his youth. On this special occasion, however, his\nline of conduct was so mysterious as for a while to baffle even those\nwho knew him best.\n\nHis house was apparently open in Sir Roger's interest. Beer, at any\nrate, was flowing there as elsewhere; and scarlet ribbons going\nin--not, perhaps, in a state of perfect steadiness--came out more\nunsteady than before. Still had Mr Reddypalm been deaf to the voice\nof that charmer, Closerstil, though he had charmed with all his\nwisdom. Mr Reddypalm had stated, first his unwillingness to vote at\nall:--he had, he said, given over politics, and was not inclined to\ntrouble his mind again with the subject; then he had spoken of his\ngreat devotion to the Duke of Omnium, under whose grandfathers his\ngrandfather had been bred: Mr Nearthewinde had, as he said, been\nwith him, and proved to him beyond a shadow of a doubt that it would\nshow the deepest ingratitude on his part to vote against the duke's\ncandidate.\n\nMr Closerstil thought he understood all this, and sent more, and\nstill more men to drink beer. He even caused--taking infinite trouble\nto secure secrecy in the matter--three gallons of British brandy to\nbe ordered and paid for as the best French. But, nevertheless, Mr\nReddypalm made no sign to show that he considered that the right\nthing had been done. On the evening before the election, he told\none of Mr Closerstil's confidential men, that he had thought a good\ndeal about it, and that he believed he should be constrained by his\nconscience to vote for Mr Moffat.\n\nWe have said that Mr Closerstil was accompanied by a learned friend\nof his, one Mr Romer, a barrister, who was greatly interested in Sir\nRoger, and who, being a strong Liberal, was assisting in the canvass\nwith much energy. He, hearing how matters were likely to go with\nthis conscientious publican, and feeling himself peculiarly capable\nof dealing with such delicate scruples, undertook to look into the\ncase in hand. Early, therefore, on the morning of the election, he\nsauntered down the cross street in which hung out the sign of the\nBrown Bear, and, as he expected, found Mr Reddypalm near his own\ndoor.\n\nNow it was quite an understood thing that there was to be no bribery.\nThis was understood by no one better than by Mr Romer, who had, in\ntruth, drawn up many of the published assurances to that effect. And,\nto give him his due, he was fully minded to act in accordance with\nthese assurances. The object of all the parties was to make it worth\nthe voters' while to give their votes; but to do so without bribery.\nMr Romer had repeatedly declared that he would have nothing to do\nwith any illegal practising; but he had also declared that, as long\nas all was done according to law, he was ready to lend his best\nefforts to assist Sir Roger. How he assisted Sir Roger, and adhered\nto the law, will now be seen.\n\nOh, Mr Romer! Mr Romer! is it not the case with thee that thou\n\"wouldst not play false, and yet wouldst wrongly win?\" Not in\nelectioneering, Mr Romer, any more than in other pursuits, can a man\ntouch pitch and not be defiled; as thou, innocent as thou art, wilt\nsoon learn to thy terrible cost.\n\n\"Well, Reddypalm,\" said Mr Romer, shaking hands with him. Mr Romer\nhad not been equally cautious as Nearthewinde, and had already drunk\nsundry glasses of ale at the Brown Bear, in the hope of softening the\nstern Bear-warden. \"How is it to be to-day? Which is to be the man?\"\n\n\"If any one knows that, Mr Romer, you must be the man. A poor\nnumbskull like me knows nothing of them matters. How should I?\nAll I looks to, Mr Romer, is selling a trifle of drink now and\nthen--selling it, and getting paid for it, you know, Mr Romer.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's important, no doubt. But come, Reddypalm, such an old\nfriend of Sir Roger as you are, a man he speaks of as one of his\nintimate friends, I wonder how you can hesitate about it? Now with\nanother man, I should think that he wanted to be paid for voting--\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr Romer!--fie--fie--fie!\"\n\n\"I know it's not the case with you. It would be an insult to offer\nyou money, even if money were going. I should not mention this, only\nas money is not going, neither on our side nor on the other, no harm\ncan be done.\"\n\n\"Mr Romer, if you speak of such a thing, you'll hurt me. I know the\nvalue of an Englishman's franchise too well to wish to sell it. I\nwould not demean myself so low; no, not though five-and-twenty pound\na vote was going, as there was in the good old times--and that's not\nso long ago neither.\"\n\n\"I am sure you wouldn't, Reddypalm; I'm sure you wouldn't. But an\nhonest man like you should stick to old friends. Now, tell me,\" and\nputting his arm through Reddypalm's, he walked with him into the\npassage of his own house; \"Now, tell me--is there anything wrong?\nIt's between friends, you know. Is there anything wrong?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't sell my vote for untold gold,\" said Reddypalm, who was\nperhaps aware that untold gold would hardly be offered to him for it.\n\n\"I am sure you would not,\" said Mr Romer.\n\n\"But,\" said Reddypalm, \"a man likes to be paid his little bill.\"\n\n\"Surely, surely,\" said the barrister.\n\n\"And I did say two years since, when your friend Mr Closerstil\nbrought a friend of his down to stand here--it wasn't Sir Roger\nthen--but when he brought a friend of his down, and when I drew\ntwo or three hogsheads of ale on their side, and when my bill was\nquestioned and only half-settled, I did say that I wouldn't interfere\nwith no election no more. And no more I will, Mr Romer--unless it be\nto give a quiet vote for the nobleman under whom I and mine always\nlived respectable.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Mr Romer.\n\n\"A man do like to have his bill paid, you know, Mr Romer.\"\n\nMr Romer could not but acknowledge that this was a natural feeling on\nthe part of an ordinary mortal publican.\n\n\"It goes agin the grain with a man not to have his little bill paid,\nand specially at election time,\" again urged Mr Reddypalm.\n\nMr Romer had not much time to think about it; but he knew well that\nmatters were so nearly balanced, that the votes of Mr Reddypalm and\nhis son were of inestimable value.\n\n\"If it's only about your bill,\" said Mr Romer, \"I'll see to have that\nsettled. I'll speak to Closerstil about that.\"\n\n\"All right!\" said Reddypalm, seizing the young barrister's hand, and\nshaking it warmly; \"all right!\" And late in the afternoon when a vote\nor two became matter of intense interest, Mr Reddypalm and his son\ncame up to the hustings and boldly tendered theirs for their old\nfriend, Sir Roger.\n\nThere was a great deal of eloquence heard in Barchester on that day.\nSir Roger had by this time so far recovered as to be able to go\nthrough the dreadfully hard work of canvassing and addressing the\nelectors from eight in the morning till near sunset. A very perfect\nrecovery, most men will say. Yes; a perfect recovery as regarded the\ntemporary use of his faculties, both physical and mental; though\nit may be doubted whether there can be any permanent recovery from\nsuch disease as his. What amount of brandy he consumed to enable\nhim to perform this election work, and what lurking evil effect the\nexcitement might have on him--of these matters no record was kept in\nthe history of those proceedings.\n\nSir Roger's eloquence was of a rough kind; but not perhaps the less\noperative on those for whom it was intended. The aristocracy of\nBarchester consisted chiefly of clerical dignitaries, bishops, deans,\nprebendaries, and such like: on them and theirs it was not probable\nthat anything said by Sir Roger would have much effect. Those men\nwould either abstain from voting, or vote for the railway hero,\nwith the view of keeping out the de Courcy candidate. Then came the\nshopkeepers, who might also be regarded as a stiff-necked generation,\nimpervious to electioneering eloquence. They would, generally,\nsupport Mr Moffat. But there was an inferior class of voters,\nten-pound freeholders, and such like, who, at this period, were\nsomewhat given to have an opinion of their own, and over them it was\nsupposed that Sir Roger did obtain some power by his gift of talking.\n\n\"Now, gentlemen, will you tell me this,\" said he, bawling at the top\nof his voice from off the portico which graced the door of the Dragon\nof Wantley, at which celebrated inn Sir Roger's committee sat:--\"Who\nis Mr Moffat, and what has he done for us? There have been some\npicture-makers about the town this week past. The Lord knows who\nthey are; I don't. These clever fellows do tell you who I am, and\nwhat I've done. I ain't very proud of the way they've painted me,\nthough there's something about it I ain't ashamed of either. See\nhere,\" and he held up on one side of him one of the great daubs of\nhimself--\"just hold it there till I can explain it,\" and he handed\nthe paper to one of his friends. \"That's me,\" said Sir Roger, putting\nup his stick, and pointing to the pimply-nosed representation of\nhimself.\n\n\"Hurrah! Hur-r-rah! more power to you--we all know who you are,\nRoger. You're the boy! When did you get drunk last?\" Such-like\ngreetings, together with a dead cat which was flung at him from the\ncrowd, and which he dexterously parried with his stick, were the\nanswers which he received to this exordium.\n\n\"Yes,\" said he, quite undismayed by this little missile which had\nso nearly reached him: \"that's me. And look here; this brown,\ndirty-looking broad streak here is intended for a railway; and that\nthing in my hand--not the right hand; I'll come to that presently--\"\n\n\"How about the brandy, Roger?\"\n\n\"I'll come to that presently. I'll tell you about the brandy in good\ntime. But that thing in my left hand is a spade. Now, I never handled\na spade, and never could; but, boys, I handled a chisel and mallet;\nand many a hundred block of stone has come out smooth from under that\nhand;\" and Sir Roger lifted up his great broad palm wide open.\n\n\"So you did, Roger, and well we minds it.\"\n\n\"The meaning, however, of that spade is to show that I made the\nrailway. Now I'm very much obliged to those gentlemen over at the\nWhite Horse for putting up this picture of me. It's a true picture,\nand it tells you who I am. I did make that railway. I have made\nthousands of miles of railway; I am making thousands of miles of\nrailways--some in Europe, some in Asia, some in America. It's a\ntrue picture,\" and he poked his stick through it and held it up to\nthe crowd. \"A true picture: but for that spade and that railway, I\nshouldn't be now here asking your votes; and, when next February\ncomes, I shouldn't be sitting in Westminster to represent you, as, by\nGod's grace, I certainly will do. That tells you who I am. But now,\nwill you tell me who Mr Moffat is?\"\n\n\"How about the brandy, Roger?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, the brandy! I was forgetting that and the little speech\nthat is coming out of my mouth--a deal shorter speech, and a better\none than what I am making now. Here, in the right hand you see a\nbrandy bottle. Well, boys, I'm not a bit ashamed of that; as long\nas a man does his work--and the spade shows that--it's only fair he\nshould have something to comfort him. I'm always able to work, and\nfew men work much harder. I'm always able to work, and no man has a\nright to expect more of me. I never expect more than that from those\nwho work for me.\"\n\n\"No more you don't, Roger: a little drop's very good, ain't it,\nRoger? Keeps the cold from the stomach, eh, Roger?\"\n\n\"Then as to this speech, 'Come, Jack, let's have a drop of some'at\nshort.' Why, that's a good speech too. When I do drink I like to\nshare with a friend; and I don't care how humble that friend is.\"\n\n\"Hurrah! more power. That's true too, Roger; may you never be without\na drop to wet your whistle.\"\n\n\"They say I'm the last new baronet. Well, I ain't ashamed of that;\nnot a bit. When will Mr Moffat get himself made a baronet? No man\ncan truly say I'm too proud of it. I have never stuck myself up; no,\nnor stuck my wife up either: but I don't see much to be ashamed of\nbecause the bigwigs chose to make a baronet of me.\"\n\n\"Nor, no more thee h'ant, Roger. We'd all be barrownites if so be we\nknew the way.\"\n\n\"But now, having polished off this bit of picture, let me ask you who\nMr Moffat is? There are pictures enough about him, too; though Heaven\nknows where they all come from. I think Sir Edwin Landseer must have\ndone this one of the goose; it is so deadly natural. Look at it;\nthere he is. Upon my word, whoever did that ought to make his fortune\nat some of these exhibitions. Here he is again, with a big pair\nof scissors. He calls himself 'England's honour;' what the deuce\nEngland's honour has to do with tailoring, I can't tell you: perhaps\nMr Moffat can. But mind you, my friends, I don't say anything against\ntailoring: some of you are tailors, I dare say.\"\n\n\"Yes, we be,\" said a little squeaking voice from out of the crowd.\n\n\"And a good trade it is. When I first knew Barchester there were\ntailors here could lick any stone-mason in the trade; I say nothing\nagainst tailors. But it isn't enough for a man to be a tailor unless\nhe's something else along with it. You're not so fond of tailors that\nyou'll send one up to Parliament merely because he is a tailor.\"\n\n\"We won't have no tailors. No; nor yet no cabbaging. Take a go of\nbrandy, Roger; you're blown.\"\n\n\"No, I'm not blown yet. I've a deal more to say about Mr Moffat\nbefore I shall be blown. What has he done to entitle him to come here\nbefore you and ask you to send him to Parliament? Why; he isn't even\na tailor. I wish he were. There's always some good in a fellow who\nknows how to earn his own bread. But he isn't a tailor; he can't even\nput a stitch in towards mending England's honour. His father was a\ntailor; not a Barchester tailor, mind you, so as to give him any\nclaim on your affections; but a London tailor. Now the question is,\ndo you want to send the son of a London tailor up to Parliament to\nrepresent you?\"\n\n\"No, we don't; nor yet we won't either.\"\n\n\"I rather think not. You've had him once, and what has he done for\nyou? Has he said much for you in the House of Commons? Why, he's so\ndumb a dog that he can't bark even for a bone. I'm told it's quite\npainful to hear him fumbling and mumbling and trying to get up a\nspeech there over at the White Horse. He doesn't belong to the city;\nhe hasn't done anything for the city; and he hasn't the power to do\nanything for the city. Then, why on earth does he come here? I'll\ntell you. The Earl de Courcy brings him. He's going to marry the\nEarl de Courcy's niece; for they say he's very rich--this tailor's\nson--only they do say also that he doesn't much like to spend his\nmoney. He's going to marry Lord de Courcy's niece, and Lord de Courcy\nwishes that his nephew should be in Parliament. There, that's the\nclaim which Mr Moffat has here on the people of Barchester. He's Lord\nde Courcy's nominee, and those who feel themselves bound hand and\nfoot, heart and soul, to Lord de Courcy, had better vote for him.\nSuch men have my leave. If there are enough of such at Barchester to\nsend him to Parliament, the city in which I was born must be very\nmuch altered since I was a young man.\"\n\nAnd so finishing his speech, Sir Roger retired within, and recruited\nhimself in the usual manner.\n\nSuch was the flood of eloquence at the Dragon of Wantly. At the White\nHorse, meanwhile, the friends of the de Courcy interest were treated\nperhaps to sounder political views; though not expressed in periods\nso intelligibly fluent as those of Sir Roger.\n\nMr Moffat was a young man, and there was no knowing to what\nproficiency in the Parliamentary gift of public talking he might yet\nattain; but hitherto his proficiency was not great. He had, however,\nendeavoured to make up by study for any want of readiness of speech,\nand had come to Barchester daily, for the last four days, fortified\nwith a very pretty harangue, which he had prepared for himself in\nthe solitude of his chamber. On the three previous days matters\nhad been allowed to progress with tolerable smoothness, and he had\nbeen permitted to deliver himself of his elaborate eloquence with\nfew other interruptions than those occasioned by his own want of\npractice. But on this, the day of days, the Barchesterian roughs were\nnot so complaisant. It appeared to Mr Moffat, when he essayed to\nspeak, that he was surrounded by enemies rather than friends; and in\nhis heart he gave great blame to Mr Nearthewinde for not managing\nmatters better for him.\n\n\"Men of Barchester,\" he began, in a voice which was every now and\nthen preternaturally loud, but which, at each fourth or fifth word,\ngave way from want of power, and descended to its natural weak tone.\n\"Men of Barchester--electors and non-electors--\"\n\n\"We is hall electors; hall on us, my young kiddy.\"\n\n\"Electors and non-electors, I now ask your suffrages, not for the\nfirst time--\"\n\n\"Oh! we've tried you. We know what you're made on. Go on, Snip; don't\nyou let 'em put you down.\"\n\n\"I've had the honour of representing you in Parliament for the last\ntwo years and--\"\n\n\"And a deuced deal you did for us, didn't you?\"\n\n\"What could you expect from the ninth part of a man? Never mind,\nSnip--go on; don't you be put out by any of them. Stick to your wax\nand thread like a man--like the ninth part of a man--go on a little\nfaster, Snip.\"\n\n\"For the last two years--and--and--\" Here Mr Moffat looked round to\nhis friends for some little support, and the Honourable George, who\nstood close behind him, suggested that he had gone through it like a\nbrick.\n\n\"And--and I went through it like a brick,\" said Mr Moffat, with the\ngravest possible face, taking up in his utter confusion the words\nthat were put into his mouth.\n\n\"Hurray!--so you did--you're the real brick. Well done, Snip; go it\nagain with the wax and thread!\"\n\n\"I am a thorough-paced reformer,\" continued Mr Moffat, somewhat\nreassured by the effect of the opportune words which his friend had\nwhispered into his ear. \"A thorough-paced reformer--a thorough-paced\nreformer--\"\n\n\"Go on, Snip. We all know what that means.\"\n\n\"A thorough-paced reformer--\"\n\n\"Never mind your paces, man; but get on. Tell us something new. We're\nall reformers, we are.\"\n\nPoor Mr Moffat was a little thrown back. It wasn't so easy to tell\nthese gentlemen anything new, harnessed as he was at this moment; so\nhe looked back at his honourable supporter for some further hint.\n\"Say something about their daughters,\" whispered George, whose own\nflights of oratory were always on that subject. Had he counselled Mr\nMoffat to say a word or two about the tides, his advice would not\nhave been less to the purpose.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" he began again--\"you all know that I am a thorough-paced\nreformer--\"\n\n\"Oh, drat your reform. He's a dumb dog. Go back to your goose,\nSnippy; you never were made for this work. Go to Courcy Castle and\nreform that.\"\n\nMr Moffat, grieved in his soul, was becoming inextricably bewildered\nby such faceti\u00c3\u00a6 as these, when an egg,--and it may be feared not a\nfresh egg,--flung with unerring precision, struck him on the open\npart of his well-plaited shirt, and reduced him to speechless\ndespair.\n\nAn egg is a means of delightful support when properly administered;\nbut it is not calculated to add much spirit to a man's eloquence, or\nto ensure his powers of endurance, when supplied in the manner above\ndescribed. Men there are, doubtless, whose tongues would not be\nstopped even by such an argument as this; but Mr Moffat was not one\nof them. As the insidious fluid trickled down beneath his waistcoat,\nhe felt that all further powers of coaxing the electors out of their\nvotes, by words flowing from his tongue sweeter than honey, was\nfor that occasion denied to him. He could not be self-confident,\nenergetic, witty, and good-humoured with a rotten egg drying through\nhis clothes. He was forced, therefore, to give way, and with sadly\ndisconcerted air retired from the open window at which he had been\nstanding.\n\nIt was in vain that the Honourable George, Mr Nearthewinde, and Frank\nendeavoured again to bring him to the charge. He was like a beaten\nprize-fighter, whose pluck has been cowed out of him, and who, if he\nstands up, only stands up to fall. Mr Moffat got sulky also, and when\nhe was pressed, said that Barchester and the people in it might be\nd----. \"With all my heart,\" said Mr Nearthewinde. \"That wouldn't have\nany effect on their votes.\"\n\nBut, in truth, it mattered very little whether Mr Moffat spoke,\nor whether he didn't speak. Four o'clock was the hour for closing\nthe poll, and that was now fast coming. Tremendous exertions had\nbeen made about half-past three, by a safe emissary sent from\nNearthewinde, to prove to Mr Reddypalm that all manner of contingent\nadvantages would accrue to the Brown Bear if it should turn out that\nMr Moffat should take his seat for Barchester. No bribe was, of\ncourse, offered or even hinted at. The purity of Barchester was not\ncontaminated during the day by one such curse as this. But a man, and\na publican, would be required to do some great deed in the public\nline; to open some colossal tap; to draw beer for the million; and no\none would be so fit as Mr Reddypalm--if only it might turn out that\nMr Moffat should, in the coming February, take his seat as member for\nBarchester.\n\nBut Mr Reddypalm was a man of humble desires, whose ambitions soared\nno higher than this--that his little bills should be duly settled. It\nis wonderful what love an innkeeper has for his bill in its entirety.\nAn account, with a respectable total of five or six pounds, is\nbrought to you, and you complain but of one article; that fire in the\nbedroom was never lighted; or that second glass of brandy and water\nwas never called for. You desire to have the shilling expunged, and\nall your host's pleasure in the whole transaction is destroyed. Oh!\nmy friends, pay for the brandy and water, though you never drank it;\nsuffer the fire to pass, though it never warmed you. Why make a good\nman miserable for such a trifle?\n\nIt became notified to Reddypalm with sufficient clearness that his\nbill for the past election should be paid without further question;\nand, therefore, at five o'clock the Mayor of Barchester proclaimed\nthe results of the contest in the following figures:--\n\n\n   Scatcherd    378\n   Moffat       376\n\n\nMr Reddypalm's two votes had decided the question. Mr Nearthewinde\nimmediately went up to town; and the dinner party at Courcy Castle\nthat evening was not a particularly pleasant meal.\n\nThis much, however, had been absolutely decided before the yellow\ncommittee concluded their labour at the White Horse: there should be\na petition. Mr Nearthewinde had not been asleep, and already knew\nsomething of the manner in which Mr Reddypalm's mind had been\nquieted.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nThe Rivals\n\n\nThe intimacy between Frank and Miss Dunstable grew and prospered.\nThat is to say, it prospered as an intimacy, though perhaps hardly\nas a love affair. There was a continued succession of jokes between\nthem, which no one else in the castle understood; but the very fact\nof there being such a good understanding between them rather stood\nin the way of, than assisted, that consummation which the countess\ndesired. People, when they are in love with each other, or even when\nthey pretend to be, do not generally show it by loud laughter. Nor is\nit frequently the case that a wife with two hundred thousand pounds\ncan be won without some little preliminary despair. Now there was no\ndespair at all about Frank Gresham.\n\nLady de Courcy, who thoroughly understood that portion of the world\nin which she herself lived, saw that things were not going quite as\nthey should do, and gave much and repeated advice to Frank on the\nsubject. She was the more eager in doing this, because she imagined\nFrank had done what he could to obey her first precepts. He had not\nturned up his nose at Miss Dunstable's curls, nor found fault with\nher loud voice: he had not objected to her as ugly, nor even shown\nany dislike to her age. A young man who had been so amenable to\nreason was worthy of further assistance; and so Lady de Courcy did\nwhat she could to assist him.\n\n\"Frank, my dear boy,\" she would say, \"you are a little too noisy, I\nthink. I don't mean for myself, you know; I don't mind it. But Miss\nDunstable would like it better if you were a little more quiet with\nher.\"\n\n\"Would she, aunt?\" said Frank, looking demurely up into the\ncountess's face. \"I rather think she likes fun and noise, and that\nsort of thing. You know she's not very quiet herself.\"\n\n\"Ah!--but Frank, there are times, you know, when that sort of thing\nshould be laid aside. Fun, as you call it, is all very well in its\nplace. Indeed, no one likes it better than I do. But that's not the\nway to show admiration. Young ladies like to be admired; and if\nyou'll be a little more soft-mannered with Miss Dunstable, I'm sure\nyou'll find it will answer better.\"\n\nAnd so the old bird taught the young bird how to fly--very\nneedlessly--for in this matter of flying, Nature gives her own\nlessons thoroughly; and the ducklings will take the water, even\nthough the maternal hen warn them against the perfidious element\nnever so loudly.\n\nSoon after this, Lady de Courcy began to be not very well pleased\nin the matter. She took it into her head that Miss Dunstable was\nsometimes almost inclined to laugh at her; and on one or two\noccasions it almost seemed as though Frank was joining Miss Dunstable\nin doing so. The fact indeed was, that Miss Dunstable was fond of\nfun; and, endowed as she was with all the privileges which two\nhundred thousand pounds may be supposed to give to a young lady,\ndid not very much care at whom she laughed. She was able to make a\ntolerably correct guess at Lady de Courcy's plan towards herself;\nbut she did not for a moment think that Frank had any intention\nof furthering his aunt's views. She was, therefore, not at all\nill-inclined to have her revenge on the countess.\n\n\"How very fond your aunt is of you!\" she said to him one wet morning,\nas he was sauntering through the house; now laughing, and almost\nromping with her--then teasing his sister about Mr Moffat--and then\nbothering his lady-cousins out of all their propriety.\n\n\"Oh, very!\" said Frank: \"she is a dear, good woman, is my Aunt de\nCourcy.\"\n\n\"I declare she takes more notice of you and your doings than of any\nof your cousins. I wonder they ain't jealous.\"\n\n\"Oh! they're such good people. Bless me, they'd never be jealous.\"\n\n\"You are so much younger than they are, that I suppose she thinks you\nwant more of her care.\"\n\n\"Yes; that's it. You see she's fond of having a baby to nurse.\"\n\n\"Tell me, Mr Gresham, what was it she was saying to you last night? I\nknow we had been misbehaving ourselves dreadfully. It was all your\nfault; you would make me laugh so.\"\n\n\"That's just what I said to her.\"\n\n\"She was talking about me, then?\"\n\n\"How on earth should she talk of any one else as long as you are\nhere? Don't you know that all the world is talking about you?\"\n\n\"Is it?--dear me, how kind! But I don't care a straw about any world\njust at present but Lady de Courcy's world. What did she say?\"\n\n\"She said you were very beautiful--\"\n\n\"Did she?--how good of her!\"\n\n\"No; I forgot. It--it was I that said that; and she said--what was\nit she said? She said, that after all, beauty was but skin deep--and\nthat she valued you for your virtues and prudence rather than your\ngood looks.\"\n\n\"Virtues and prudence! She said I was prudent and virtuous?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And you talked of my beauty? That was so kind of you. You didn't\neither of you say anything about other matters?\"\n\n\"What other matters?\"\n\n\"Oh! I don't know. Only some people are sometimes valued rather for\nwhat they've got than for any good qualities belonging to themselves\nintrinsically.\"\n\n\"That can never be the case with Miss Dunstable; especially not at\nCourcy Castle,\" said Frank, bowing easily from the corner of the sofa\nover which he was leaning.\n\n\"Of course not,\" said Miss Dunstable; and Frank at once perceived\nthat she spoke in a tone of voice differing much from that\nhalf-bantering, half-good-humoured manner that was customary with\nher. \"Of course not: any such idea would be quite out of the question\nwith Lady de Courcy.\" She paused for a moment, and then added\nin a tone different again, and unlike any that he had yet heard\nfrom her:--\"It is, at any rate, out of the question with Mr Frank\nGresham--of that I am quite sure.\"\n\nFrank ought to have understood her, and have appreciated the good\nopinion which she intended to convey; but he did not entirely do so.\nHe was hardly honest himself towards her; and he could not at first\nperceive that she intended to say that she thought him so. He knew\nvery well that she was alluding to her own huge fortune, and was\nalluding also to the fact that people of fashion sought her because\nof it; but he did not know that she intended to express a true\nacquittal as regarded him of any such baseness.\n\nAnd did he deserve to be acquitted? Yes, upon the whole he did;--to\nbe acquitted of that special sin. His desire to make Miss Dunstable\ntemporarily subject to his sway arose, not from a hankering after her\nfortune, but from an ambition to get the better of a contest in which\nother men around him seemed to be failing.\n\nFor it must not be imagined that, with such a prize to be struggled\nfor, all others stood aloof and allowed him to have his own way\nwith the heiress, undisputed. The chance of a wife with two hundred\nthousand pounds is a godsend which comes in a man's life too seldom\nto be neglected, let that chance be never so remote.\n\nFrank was the heir to a large embarrassed property; and, therefore,\nthe heads of families, putting their wisdoms together, had thought it\nmost meet that this daughter of Plutus should, if possible, fall to\nhis lot. But not so thought the Honourable George; and not so thought\nanother gentleman who was at that time an inmate of Courcy Castle.\n\nThese suitors perhaps somewhat despised their young rival's efforts.\nIt may be that they had sufficient worldly wisdom to know that so\nimportant a crisis of life is not settled among quips and jokes, and\nthat Frank was too much in jest to be in earnest. But be that as it\nmay, his love-making did not stand in the way of their love-making;\nnor his hopes, if he had any, in the way of their hopes.\n\nThe Honourable George had discussed the matter with the Honourable\nJohn in a properly fraternal manner. It may be that John had also\nan eye to the heiress; but, if so, he had ceded his views to his\nbrother's superior claims; for it came about that they understood\neach other very well, and John favoured George with salutary advice\non the occasion.\n\n\"If it is to be done at all, it should be done very sharp,\" said\nJohn.\n\n\"As sharp as you like,\" said George. \"I'm not the fellow to be\nstudying three months in what attitude I'll fall at a girl's feet.\"\n\n\"No: and when you are there you mustn't take three months more to\nstudy how you'll get up again. If you do it at all, you must do it\nsharp,\" repeated John, putting great stress on his advice.\n\n\"I have said a few soft words to her already, and she didn't seem to\ntake them badly,\" said George.\n\n\"She's no chicken, you know,\" remarked John; \"and with a woman like\nthat, beating about the bush never does any good. The chances are she\nwon't have you--that's of course; plums like that don't fall into a\nman's mouth merely for shaking the tree. But it's possible she may;\nand if she will, she's as likely to take you to-day as this day six\nmonths. If I were you I'd write her a letter.\"\n\n\"Write her a letter--eh?\" said George, who did not altogether dislike\nthe advice, for it seemed to take from his shoulders the burden of\npreparing a spoken address. Though he was so glib in speaking about\nthe farmers' daughters, he felt that he should have some little\ndifficulty in making known his passion to Miss Dunstable by word of\nmouth.\n\n\"Yes; write a letter. If she'll take you at all, she'll take you that\nway; half the matches going are made up by writing letters. Write her\na letter and get it put on her dressing-table.\" George said that he\nwould, and so he did.\n\nGeorge spoke quite truly when he hinted that he had said a few soft\nthings to Miss Dunstable. Miss Dunstable, however, was accustomed to\nhear soft things. She had been carried much about in society among\nfashionable people since, on the settlement of her father's will, she\nhad been pronounced heiress to all the ointment of Lebanon; and many\nmen had made calculations respecting her similar to those which were\nnow animating the brain of the Honourable George de Courcy. She was\nalready quite accustomed to being the target at which spendthrifts\nand the needy rich might shoot their arrows: accustomed to being shot\nat, and tolerably accustomed to protect herself without making scenes\nin the world, or rejecting the advantageous establishments offered\nto her with any loud expressions of disdain. The Honourable George,\ntherefore, had been permitted to say soft things very much as a\nmatter of course.\n\nAnd very little more outward fracas arose from the correspondence\nwhich followed than had arisen from the soft things so said. George\nwrote the letter, and had it duly conveyed to Miss Dunstable's\nbed-chamber. Miss Dunstable duly received it, and had her answer\nconveyed back discreetly to George's hands. The correspondence ran as\nfollows:--\n\n\n   Courcy Castle, Aug. --, 185--.\n\n   MY DEAREST MISS DUNSTABLE,\n\n   I cannot but flatter myself that you must have perceived\n   from my manner that you are not indifferent to me. Indeed,\n   indeed, you are not. I may truly say, and swear [these\n   last strong words had been put in by the special counsel\n   of the Honourable John], that if ever a man loved a woman\n   truly, I truly love you. You may think it very odd that\n   I should say this in a letter instead of speaking it out\n   before your face; but your powers of raillery are so great\n   [\"touch her up about her wit\" had been the advice of the\n   Honourable John] that I am all but afraid to encounter\n   them. Dearest, dearest Martha--oh do not blame me for so\n   addressing you!--if you will trust your happiness to me\n   you shall never find that you have been deceived. My\n   ambition shall be to make you shine in that circle which\n   you are so well qualified to adorn, and to see you firmly\n   fixed in that sphere of fashion for which all your tastes\n   adapt you.\n\n   I may safely assert--and I do assert it with my hand on\n   my heart--that I am actuated by no mercenary motives. Far\n   be it from me to marry any woman--no, not a princess--on\n   account of her money. No marriage can be happy without\n   mutual affection; and I do fully trust--no, not trust, but\n   hope--that there may be such between you and me, dearest\n   Miss Dunstable. Whatever settlements you might propose,\n   I should accede to. It is you, your sweet person, that I\n   love, not your money.\n\n   For myself, I need not remind you that I am the second son\n   of my father; and that, as such, I hold no inconsiderable\n   station in the world. My intention is to get into\n   Parliament, and to make a name for myself, if I can, among\n   those who shine in the House of Commons. My elder brother,\n   Lord Porlock, is, you are aware, unmarried; and we\n   all fear that the family honours are not likely to be\n   perpetuated by him, as he has all manner of troublesome\n   liaisons which will probably prevent his settling in life.\n   There is nothing at all of that kind in my way. It will\n   indeed be a delight to place a coronet on the head of my\n   lovely Martha: a coronet which can give no fresh grace to\n   her, but which will be so much adorned by her wearing it.\n\n   Dearest Miss Dunstable, I shall wait with the utmost\n   impatience for your answer; and now, burning with hope\n   that it may not be altogether unfavourable to my love, I\n   beg permission to sign myself--\n\n   Your own most devoted,\n\n   GEORGE DE COURCY.\n\n\nThe ardent lover had not to wait long for an answer from his\nmistress. She found this letter on her toilet-table one night as she\nwent to bed. The next morning she came down to breakfast and met her\nswain with the most unconcerned air in the world; so much so that\nhe began to think, as he munched his toast with rather a shamefaced\nlook, that the letter on which so much was to depend had not yet come\nsafely to hand. But his suspense was not of a prolonged duration.\nAfter breakfast, as was his wont, he went out to the stables with his\nbrother and Frank Gresham; and while there, Miss Dunstable's man,\ncoming up to him, touched his hat, and put a letter into his hand.\n\nFrank, who knew the man, glanced at the letter and looked at his\ncousin; but he said nothing. He was, however, a little jealous, and\nfelt that an injury was done to him by any correspondence between\nMiss Dunstable and his cousin George.\n\nMiss Dunstable's reply was as follows; and it may be remarked that\nit was written in a very clear and well-penned hand, and one which\ncertainly did not betray much emotion of the heart:--\n\n\n   MY DEAR MR DE COURCY,\n\n   I am sorry to say that I had not perceived from your\n   manner that you entertained any peculiar feelings towards\n   me; as, had I done so, I should at once have endeavoured\n   to put an end to them. I am much flattered by the way in\n   which you speak of me; but I am in too humble a position\n   to return your affection; and can, therefore, only express\n   a hope that you may be soon able to eradicate it from your\n   bosom. A letter is a very good way of making an offer, and\n   as such I do not think it at all odd; but I certainly did\n   not expect such an honour last night. As to my raillery, I\n   trust it has never yet hurt you. I can assure you it never\n   shall. I hope you will soon have a worthier ambition than\n   that to which you allude; for I am well aware that no\n   attempt will ever make me shine anywhere.\n\n   I am quite sure you have had no mercenary motives: such\n   motives in marriage are very base, and quite below your\n   name and lineage. Any little fortune that I may have must\n   be a matter of indifference to one who looks forward, as\n   you do, to put a coronet on his wife's brow. Nevertheless,\n   for the sake of the family, I trust that Lord Porlock, in\n   spite of his obstacles, may live to do the same for a wife\n   of his own some of these days. I am glad to hear that\n   there is nothing to interfere with your own prospects of\n   domestic felicity.\n\n   Sincerely hoping that you may be perfectly successful in\n   your proud ambition to shine in Parliament, and regretting\n   extremely that I cannot share that ambition with you, I\n   beg to subscribe myself, with very great respect,--\n\n   Your sincere well-wisher,\n\n   MARTHA DUNSTABLE.\n\n\nThe Honourable George, with that modesty which so well became him,\naccepted Miss Dunstable's reply as a final answer to his little\nproposition, and troubled her with no further courtship. As he said\nto his brother John, no harm had been done, and he might have better\nluck next time. But there was an inmate of Courcy Castle who was\nsomewhat more pertinacious in his search after love and wealth. This\nwas no other than Mr Moffat: a gentleman whose ambition was not\nsatisfied by the cares of his Barchester contest, or the possession\nof one affianced bride.\n\nMr Moffat was, as we have said, a man of wealth; but we all know,\nfrom the lessons of early youth, how the love of money increases and\ngains strength by its own success. Nor was he a man of so mean a\nspirit as to be satisfied with mere wealth. He desired also place and\nstation, and gracious countenance among the great ones of the earth.\nHence had come his adherence to the de Courcys; hence his seat in\nParliament; and hence, also, his perhaps ill-considered match with\nMiss Gresham.\n\nThere is no doubt but that the privilege of matrimony offers\nopportunities to money-loving young men which ought not to be lightly\nabused. Too many young men marry without giving any consideration to\nthe matter whatever. It is not that they are indifferent to money,\nbut that they recklessly miscalculate their own value, and omit to\nlook around and see how much is done by those who are more careful.\nA man can be young but once, and, except in cases of a special\ninterposition of Providence, can marry but once. The chance once\nthrown away may be said to be irrevocable! How, in after-life, do\nmen toil and turmoil through long years to attain some prospect of\ndoubtful advancement! Half that trouble, half that care, a tithe of\nthat circumspection would, in early youth, have probably secured to\nthem the enduring comfort of a wife's wealth.\n\nYou will see men labouring night and day to become bank directors;\nand even a bank direction may only be the road to ruin. Others will\nspend years in degrading subserviency to obtain a niche in a will;\nand the niche, when at last obtained and enjoyed, is but a sorry\npayment for all that has been endured. Others, again, struggle\nharder still, and go through even deeper waters: they make wills for\nthemselves, forge stock-shares, and fight with unremitting, painful\nlabour to appear to be the thing that they are not. Now, in many\nof these cases, all this might have been spared had the men made\nadequate use of those opportunities which youth and youthful charms\nafford once--and once only. There is no road to wealth so easy and\nrespectable as that of matrimony; that, is of course, provided that\nthe aspirant declines the slow course of honest work. But then, we\ncan so seldom put old heads on young shoulders!\n\nIn the case of Mr Moffat, we may perhaps say that a specimen was\nproduced of this bird, so rare in the land. His shoulders were\ncertainly young, seeing that he was not yet six-and-twenty; but\nhis head had ever been old. From the moment when he was first put\nforth to go alone--at the age of twenty-one--his life had been one\ncalculation how he could make the most of himself. He had allowed\nhimself to be betrayed into no folly by an unguarded heart; no\nyouthful indiscretion had marred his prospects. He had made the\nmost of himself. Without wit, or depth, or any mental gift--without\nhonesty of purpose or industry for good work--he had been for two\nyears sitting member for Barchester; was the guest of Lord de Courcy;\nwas engaged to the eldest daughter of one of the best commoners'\nfamilies in England; and was, when he first began to think of Miss\nDunstable, sanguine that his re-election to Parliament was secure.\n\nWhen, however, at this period he began to calculate what his position\nin the world really was, it occurred to him that he was doing an\nill-judged thing in marrying Miss Gresham. Why marry a penniless\ngirl--for Augusta's trifle of a fortune was not a penny in his\nestimation--while there was Miss Dunstable in the world to be won?\nHis own six or seven thousand a year, quite unembarrassed as it was,\nwas certainly a great thing; but what might he not do if to that\nhe could add the almost fabulous wealth of the great heiress? Was\nshe not here, put absolutely in his path? Would it not be a wilful\nthrowing away of a chance not to avail himself of it? He must, to\nbe sure, lose the de Courcy friendship; but if he should then have\nsecured his Barchester seat for the usual term of parliamentary\nsession, he might be able to spare that. He would also, perhaps,\nencounter some Gresham enmity: this was a point on which he did think\nmore than once: but what will not a man encounter for the sake of two\nhundred thousand pounds?\n\nIt was thus that Mr Moffat argued with himself, with much prudence,\nand brought himself to resolve that he would at any rate become a\ncandidate for the great prize. He also, therefore, began to say\nsoft things; and it must be admitted that he said them with more\nconsiderate propriety than had the Honourable George. Mr Moffat had\nan idea that Miss Dunstable was not a fool, and that in order to\ncatch her he must do more than endeavour to lay salt on her tail,\nin the guise of flattery. It was evident to him that she was a bird\nof some cunning, not to be caught by an ordinary gin, such as those\ncommonly in use with the Honourable Georges of Society.\n\nIt seemed to Mr Moffat, that though Miss Dunstable was so sprightly,\nso full of fun, and so ready to chatter on all subjects, she well\nknew the value of her own money, and of her position as dependent on\nit: he perceived that she never flattered the countess, and seemed\nto be no whit absorbed by the titled grandeur of her host's family.\nHe gave her credit, therefore, for an independent spirit: and an\nindependent spirit in his estimation was one that placed its sole\ndependence on a respectable balance at its banker's.\n\nWorking on these ideas, Mr Moffat commenced operations in such manner\nthat his overtures to the heiress should not, if unsuccessful,\ninterfere with the Greshamsbury engagement. He began by making common\ncause with Miss Dunstable: their positions in the world, he said to\nher, were closely similar. They had both risen from the lower class\nby the strength of honest industry: they were both now wealthy, and\nhad both hitherto made such use of their wealth as to induce the\nhighest aristocracy of England to admit them into their circles.\n\n\"Yes, Mr Moffat,\" had Miss Dunstable remarked; \"and if all that I\nhear be true, to admit you into their very families.\"\n\nAt this Mr Moffat slightly demurred. He would not affect, he said,\nto misunderstand what Miss Dunstable meant. There had been something\nsaid on the probability of such an event; but he begged Miss\nDunstable not to believe all that she heard on such subjects.\n\n\"I do not believe much,\" said she; \"but I certainly did think that\nthat might be credited.\"\n\nMr Moffat then went on to show how it behoved them both, in holding\nout their hands half-way to meet the aristocratic overtures that\nwere made to them, not to allow themselves to be made use of. The\naristocracy, according to Mr Moffat, were people of a very nice\nsort; the best acquaintance in the world; a portion of mankind to be\nnoticed by whom should be one of the first objects in the life of the\nDunstables and the Moffats. But the Dunstables and Moffats should be\nvery careful to give little or nothing in return. Much, very much in\nreturn, would be looked for. The aristocracy, said Mr Moffat, were\nnot a people to allow the light of their countenance to shine forth\nwithout looking for a _quid pro quo_, for some compensating value.\nIn all their intercourse with the Dunstables and Moffats, they would\nexpect a payment. It was for the Dunstables and Moffats to see that,\nat any rate, they did not pay more for the article they got than its\nmarket value.\n\nThe way in which she, Miss Dunstable, and he, Mr Moffat, would be\nrequired to pay would be by taking each of them some poor scion of\nthe aristocracy in marriage; and thus expending their hard-earned\nwealth in procuring high-priced pleasures for some well-born pauper.\nAgainst this, peculiar caution was to be used. Of course, the further\ninduction to be shown was this: that people so circumstanced should\nmarry among themselves; the Dunstables and the Moffats each with the\nother, and not tumble into the pitfalls prepared for them.\n\nWhether these great lessons had any lasting effect on Miss\nDunstable's mind may be doubted. Perhaps she had already made up her\nmind on the subject which Mr Moffat so well discussed. She was older\nthan Mr Moffat, and, in spite of his two years of parliamentary\nexperience, had perhaps more knowledge of the world with which she\nhad to deal. But she listened to what he said with complacency;\nunderstood his object as well as she had that of his aristocratic\nrival; was no whit offended; but groaned in her spirit as she thought\nof the wrongs of Augusta Gresham.\n\nBut all this good advice, however, would not win the money for Mr\nMoffat without some more decided step; and that step he soon decided\non taking, feeling assured that what he had said would have its due\nweight with the heiress.\n\nThe party at Courcy Castle was now soon about to be broken up. The\nmale de Courcys were going down to a Scotch mountain. The female de\nCourcys were to be shipped off to an Irish castle. Mr Moffat was to\ngo up to town to prepare his petition. Miss Dunstable was again about\nto start on a foreign tour in behalf of her physician and attendants;\nand Frank Gresham was at last to be allowed to go to Cambridge; that\nis to say, unless his success with Miss Dunstable should render such\na step on his part quite preposterous.\n\n\"I think you may speak now, Frank,\" said the countess. \"I really\nthink you may: you have known her now for a considerable time; and,\nas far as I can judge, she is very fond of you.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, aunt,\" said Frank; \"she doesn't care a button for me.\"\n\n\"I think differently; and lookers-on, you know, always understand the\ngame best. I suppose you are not afraid to ask her.\"\n\n\"Afraid!\" said Frank, in a tone of considerable scorn. He almost made\nup his mind that he would ask her to show that he was not afraid.\nHis only obstacle to doing so was, that he had not the slightest\nintention of marrying her.\n\nThere was to be but one other great event before the party broke up,\nand that was a dinner at the Duke of Omnium's. The duke had already\ndeclined to come to Courcy; but he had in a measure atoned for this\nby asking some of the guests to join a great dinner which he was\nabout to give to his neighbours.\n\nMr Moffat was to leave Courcy Castle the day after the dinner-party,\nand he therefore determined to make his great attempt on the morning\nof that day. It was with some difficulty that he brought about an\nopportunity; but at last he did so, and found himself alone with Miss\nDunstable in the walks of Courcy Park.\n\n\"It is a strange thing, is it not,\" said he, recurring to his old\nview of the same subject, \"that I should be going to dine with the\nDuke of Omnium--the richest man, they say, among the whole English\naristocracy?\"\n\n\"Men of that kind entertain everybody, I believe, now and then,\" said\nMiss Dunstable, not very civilly.\n\n\"I believe they do; but I am not going as one of the everybodies.\nI am going from Lord de Courcy's house with some of his own family.\nI have no pride in that--not the least; I have more pride in my\nfather's honest industry. But it shows what money does in this\ncountry of ours.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed; money does a great deal many queer things.\" In saying\nthis Miss Dunstable could not but think that money had done a very\nqueer thing in inducing Miss Gresham to fall in love with Mr Moffat.\n\n\"Yes; wealth is very powerful: here we are, Miss Dunstable, the most\nhonoured guests in the house.\"\n\n\"Oh! I don't know about that; you may be, for you are a member of\nParliament, and all that--\"\n\n\"No; not a member now, Miss Dunstable.\"\n\n\"Well, you will be, and that's all the same; but I have no such title\nto honour, thank God.\"\n\nThey walked on in silence for a little while, for Mr Moffat hardly\nknew how to manage the business he had in hand. \"It is quite\ndelightful to watch these people,\" he said at last; \"now they accuse\nus of being tuft-hunters.\"\n\n\"Do they?\" said Miss Dunstable. \"Upon my word I didn't know that\nanybody ever so accused me.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean you and me personally.\"\n\n\"Oh! I'm glad of that.\"\n\n\"But that is what the world says of persons of our class. Now it\nseems to me that the toadying is all on the other side. The countess\nhere does toady you, and so do the young ladies.\"\n\n\"Do they? if so, upon my word I didn't know it. But, to tell the\ntruth, I don't think much of such things. I live mostly to myself, Mr\nMoffat.\"\n\n\"I see that you do, and I admire you for it; but, Miss Dunstable, you\ncannot always live so,\" and Mr Moffat looked at her in a manner which\ngave her the first intimation of his coming burst of tenderness.\n\n\"That's as may be, Mr Moffat,\" said she.\n\nHe went on beating about the bush for some time--giving her to\nunderstand how necessary it was that persons situated as they were\nshould live either for themselves or for each other, and that,\nabove all things, they should beware of falling into the mouths of\nvoracious aristocratic lions who go about looking for prey--till they\ncame to a turn in the grounds; at which Miss Dunstable declared her\ndetermination of going in. She had walked enough, she said. As by\nthis time Mr Moffat's immediate intentions were becoming visible she\nthought it prudent to retire. \"Don't let me take you in, Mr Moffat;\nbut my boots are a little damp, and Dr Easyman will never forgive me\nif I do not hurry in as fast as I can.\"\n\n\"Your feet damp?--I hope not: I do hope not,\" said he, with a look of\nthe greatest solicitude.\n\n\"Oh! it's nothing to signify; but it's well to be prudent, you know.\nGood morning, Mr Moffat.\"\n\n\"Miss Dunstable!\"\n\n\"Eh--yes!\" and Miss Dunstable stopped in the grand path. \"I won't let\nyou return with me, Mr Moffat, because I know you were not coming in\nso soon.\"\n\n\"Miss Dunstable; I shall be leaving this to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Yes; and I go myself the day after.\"\n\n\"I know it. I am going to town and you are going abroad. It may be\nlong--very long--before we meet again.\"\n\n\"About Easter,\" said Miss Dunstable; \"that is, if the doctor doesn't\nknock up on the road.\"\n\n\"And I had, had wished to say something before we part for so long a\ntime. Miss Dunstable--\"\n\n\"Stop!--Mr Moffat. Let me ask you one question. I'll hear anything\nthat you have got to say, but on one condition: that is, that Miss\nAugusta Gresham shall be by while you say it. Will you consent to\nthat?\"\n\n\"Miss Augusta Gresham,\" said he, \"has no right to listen to my\nprivate conversation.\"\n\n\"Has she not, Mr Moffat? then I think she should have. I, at any\nrate, will not so far interfere with what I look on as her undoubted\nprivileges as to be a party to any secret in which she may not\nparticipate.\"\n\n\"But, Miss Dunstable--\"\n\n\"And to tell you fairly, Mr Moffat, any secret that you do tell me, I\nshall most undoubtedly repeat to her before dinner. Good morning, Mr\nMoffat; my feet are certainly a little damp, and if I stay a moment\nlonger, Dr Easyman will put off my foreign trip for at least a week.\"\nAnd so she left him standing alone in the middle of the gravel-walk.\n\nFor a moment or two, Mr Moffat consoled himself in his misfortune by\nthinking how he might best avenge himself on Miss Dunstable. Soon,\nhowever, such futile ideas left his brain. Why should he give over\nthe chase because the rich galleon had escaped him on this, his\nfirst cruise in pursuit of her? Such prizes were not to be won so\neasily. Her present objection clearly consisted in his engagement to\nMiss Gresham, and in that only. Let that engagement be at an end,\nnotoriously and publicly broken off, and this objection would fall to\nthe ground. Yes; ships so richly freighted were not to be run down\nin one summer morning's plain sailing. Instead of looking for his\nrevenge on Miss Dunstable, it would be more prudent in him--more in\nkeeping with his character--to pursue his object, and overcome such\ndifficulties as he might find in his way.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nThe Duke of Omnium\n\n\nThe Duke of Omnium was, as we have said, a bachelor. Not the less on\nthat account did he on certain rare gala days entertain the beauty\nof the county at his magnificent rural seat, or the female fashion\nof London in Belgrave Square; but on this occasion the dinner at\nGatherum Castle--for such was the name of his mansion--was to be\nconfined to the lords of the creation. It was to be one of those days\non which he collected round his board all the notables of the county,\nin order that his popularity might not wane, or the established glory\nof his hospitable house become dim.\n\nOn such an occasion it was not probable that Lord de Courcy would be\none of the guests. The party, indeed, who went from Courcy Castle was\nnot large, and consisted of the Honourable George, Mr Moffat, and\nFrank Gresham. They went in a tax-cart, with a tandem horse, driven\nvery knowingly by George de Courcy; and the fourth seat on the back\nof the vehicle was occupied by a servant, who was to look after the\nhorses at Gatherum.\n\nThe Honourable George drove either well or luckily, for he reached\nthe duke's house in safety; but he drove very fast. Poor Miss\nDunstable! what would have been her lot had anything but good\nhappened to that vehicle, so richly freighted with her three lovers!\nThey did not quarrel as to the prize, and all reached Gatherum Castle\nin good humour with each other.\n\nThe castle was a new building of white stone, lately erected at an\nenormous cost by one of the first architects of the day. It was an\nimmense pile, and seemed to cover ground enough for a moderate-sized\ntown. But, nevertheless, report said that when it was completed,\nthe noble owner found that he had no rooms to live in; and that, on\nthis account, when disposed to study his own comfort, he resided in\na house of perhaps one-tenth the size, built by his grandfather in\nanother county.\n\nGatherum Castle would probably be called Italian in its style of\narchitecture; though it may, I think, be doubted whether any such\nedifice, or anything like it, was ever seen in any part of Italy.\nIt was a vast edifice; irregular in height--or it appeared to be\nso--having long wings on each side too high to be passed over by the\neye as mere adjuncts to the mansion, and a portico so large as to\nmake the house behind it look like another building of a greater\naltitude. This portico was supported by Ionic columns, and was in\nitself doubtless a beautiful structure. It was approached by a\nflight of steps, very broad and very grand; but, as an approach by a\nflight of steps hardly suits an Englishman's house, to the immediate\nentrance of which it is necessary that his carriage should drive,\nthere was another front door in one of the wings which was commonly\nused. A carriage, however, could on very stupendously grand\noccasions--the visits, for instance, of queens and kings, and royal\ndukes--be brought up under the portico; as the steps had been so\nconstructed as to admit of a road, with a rather stiff ascent, being\nmade close in front of the wing up into the very porch.\n\nOpening from the porch was the grand hall, which extended up to the\ntop of the house. It was magnificent, indeed; being decorated with\nmany-coloured marbles, and hung round with various trophies of the\nhouse of Omnium; banners were there, and armour; the sculptured busts\nof many noble progenitors; full-length figures in marble of those\nwho had been especially prominent; and every monument of glory that\nwealth, long years, and great achievements could bring together. If\nonly a man could but live in his hall and be for ever happy there!\nBut the Duke of Omnium could not live happily in his hall; and the\nfact was, that the architect, in contriving this magnificent entrance\nfor his own honour and fame, had destroyed the duke's house as\nregards most of the ordinary purposes of residence.\n\nNevertheless, Gatherum Castle is a very noble pile; and, standing as\nit does on an eminence, has a very fine effect when seen from many a\ndistant knoll and verdant-wooded hill.\n\nAt seven o'clock Mr de Courcy and his friends got down from their\ndrag at the smaller door--for this was no day on which to mount up\nunder the portico; nor was that any suitable vehicle to have been\nentitled to such honour. Frank felt some excitement a little stronger\nthan that usual to him at such moments, for he had never yet been in\ncompany with the Duke of Omnium; and he rather puzzled himself to\nthink on what points he would talk to the man who was the largest\nlandowner in that county in which he himself had so great an\ninterest. He, however, made up his mind that he would allow the duke\nto choose his own subjects; merely reserving to himself the right of\npointing out how deficient in gorse covers was West Barsetshire--that\nbeing the duke's division.\n\nThey were soon divested of their coats and hats, and,\nwithout entering on the magnificence of the great hall, were\nconducted through rather a narrow passage into rather a small\ndrawing-room--small, that is, in proportion to the number of\ngentlemen there assembled. There might be about thirty, and Frank was\ninclined to think that they were almost crowded. A man came forward\nto greet them when their names were announced; but our hero at once\nknew that he was not the duke; for this man was fat and short,\nwhereas the duke was thin and tall.\n\nThere was a great hubbub going on; for everybody seemed to be talking\nto his neighbour; or, in default of a neighbour, to himself. It\nwas clear that the exalted rank of their host had put very little\nconstraint on his guests' tongues, for they chatted away with as much\nfreedom as farmers at an ordinary.\n\n\"Which is the duke?\" at last Frank contrived to whisper to his\ncousin.\n\n\"Oh;--he's not here,\" said George; \"I suppose he'll be in presently.\nI believe he never shows till just before dinner.\"\n\nFrank, of course, had nothing further to say; but he already began to\nfeel himself a little snubbed: he thought that the duke, duke though\nhe was, when he asked people to dinner should be there to tell them\nthat he was glad to see them.\n\nMore people flashed into the room, and Frank found himself rather\nclosely wedged in with a stout clergyman of his acquaintance. He was\nnot badly off, for Mr Athill was a friend of his own, who had held a\nliving near Greshamsbury. Lately, however, at the lamented decease\nof Dr Stanhope--who had died of apoplexy at his villa in Italy--Mr\nAthill had been presented with the better preferment of Eiderdown,\nand had, therefore, removed to another part of the county. He was\nsomewhat of a bon-vivant, and a man who thoroughly understood\ndinner-parties; and with much good nature he took Frank under his\nspecial protection.\n\n\"You stick to me, Mr Gresham,\" he said, \"when we go into the\ndining-room. I'm an old hand at the duke's dinners, and know how to\nmake a friend comfortable as well as myself.\"\n\n\"But why doesn't the duke come in?\" demanded Frank.\n\n\"He'll be here as soon as dinner is ready,\" said Mr Athill. \"Or,\nrather, the dinner will be ready as soon as he is here. I don't care,\ntherefore, how soon he comes.\"\n\nFrank did not understand this, but he had nothing to do but to wait\nand see how things went.\n\nHe was beginning to be impatient, for the room was now nearly full,\nand it seemed evident that no other guests were coming; when suddenly\na bell rang, and a gong was sounded, and at the same instant a door\nthat had not yet been used flew open, and a very plainly dressed,\nplain, tall man entered the room. Frank at once knew that he was at\nlast in the presence of the Duke of Omnium.\n\nBut his grace, late as he was in commencing the duties as host,\nseemed in no hurry to make up for lost time. He quietly stood on the\nrug, with his back to the empty grate, and spoke one or two words in\na very low voice to one or two gentlemen who stood nearest to him.\nThe crowd, in the meanwhile, became suddenly silent. Frank, when he\nfound that the duke did not come and speak to him, felt that he ought\nto go and speak to the duke; but no one else did so, and when he\nwhispered his surprise to Mr Athill, that gentleman told him that\nthis was the duke's practice on all such occasions.\n\n\"Fothergill,\" said the duke--and it was the only word he had yet\nspoken out loud--\"I believe we are ready for dinner.\" Now Mr\nFothergill was the duke's land-agent, and he it was who had greeted\nFrank and his friends at their entrance.\n\nImmediately the gong was again sounded, and another door leading out\nof the drawing-room into the dining-room was opened. The duke led the\nway, and then the guests followed. \"Stick close to me, Mr Gresham,\"\nsaid Athill, \"we'll get about the middle of the table, where we shall\nbe cosy--and on the other side of the room, out of this dreadful\ndraught--I know the place well, Mr Gresham; stick to me.\"\n\nMr Athill, who was a pleasant, chatty companion, had hardly seated\nhimself, and was talking to Frank as quickly as he could, when Mr\nFothergill, who sat at the bottom of the table, asked him to say\ngrace. It seemed to be quite out of the question that the duke should\ntake any trouble with his guests whatever. Mr Athill consequently\ndropped the word he was speaking, and uttered a prayer--if it was a\nprayer--that they might all have grateful hearts for that which God\nwas about to give them.\n\nIf it was a prayer! As far as my own experience goes, such utterances\nare seldom prayers, seldom can be prayers. And if not prayers, what\nthen? To me it is unintelligible that the full tide of glibbest\nchatter can be stopped at a moment in the midst of profuse good\nliving, and the Giver thanked becomingly in words of heartfelt\npraise. Setting aside for the moment what one daily hears and sees,\nmay not one declare that a change so sudden is not within the compass\nof the human mind? But then, to such reasoning one cannot but add\nwhat one does hear and see; one cannot but judge of the ceremony by\nthe manner in which one sees it performed--uttered, that is--and\nlistened to. Clergymen there are--one meets them now and then--who\nendeavour to give to the dinner-table grace some of the solemnity of\na church ritual, and what is the effect? Much the same as though one\nwere to be interrupted for a minute in the midst of one of our church\nliturgies to hear a drinking-song.\n\nAnd it will be argued, that a man need be less thankful because, at\nthe moment of receiving, he utters no thanksgiving? or will it be\nthought that a man is made thankful because what is called a grace is\nuttered after dinner? It can hardly be imagined that any one will so\nargue, or so think.\n\nDinner-graces are, probably, the last remaining relic of certain\ndaily services [1] which the Church in olden days enjoined: nones,\ncomplines, and vespers were others. Of the nones and complines we\nhave happily got quit; and it might be well if we could get rid of\nthe dinner-graces also. Let any man ask himself whether, on his own\npart, they are acts of prayer and thanksgiving--and if not that, what\nthen?\n\n\n   [Footnote 1: It is, I know, alleged that graces are said\n   before dinner, because our Saviour uttered a blessing before\n   his last supper. I cannot say that the idea of such analogy\n   is pleasing to me.]\n\n\nWhen the large party entered the dining-room one or two gentlemen\nmight be seen to come in from some other door and set themselves at\nthe table near to the duke's chair. These were guests of his own, who\nwere staying in the house, his particular friends, the men with whom\nhe lived: the others were strangers whom he fed, perhaps once a year,\nin order that his name might be known in the land as that of one who\ndistributed food and wine hospitably through the county. The food\nand wine, the attendance also, and the view of the vast repository\nof plate he vouchsafed willingly to his county neighbours;--but it\nwas beyond his good nature to talk to them. To judge by the present\nappearance of most of them, they were quite as well satisfied to be\nleft alone.\n\nFrank was altogether a stranger there, but Mr Athill knew every one\nat the table.\n\n\"That's Apjohn,\" said he: \"don't you know, Mr Apjohn, the attorney\nfrom Barchester? he's always here; he does some of Fothergill's law\nbusiness, and makes himself useful. If any fellow knows the value of\na good dinner, he does. You'll see that the duke's hospitality will\nnot be thrown away on him.\"\n\n\"It's very much thrown away upon me, I know,\" said Frank, who could\nnot at all put up with the idea of sitting down to dinner without\nhaving been spoken to by his host.\n\n\"Oh, nonsense!\" said his clerical friend; \"you'll enjoy yourself\namazingly by and by. There is not such champagne in any other house\nin Barsetshire; and then the claret--\" And Mr Athill pressed his lips\ntogether, and gently shook his head, meaning to signify by the motion\nthat the claret of Gatherum Castle was sufficient atonement for any\npenance which a man might have to go through in his mode of obtaining\nit.\n\n\"Who's that funny little man sitting there, next but one to Mr de\nCourcy? I never saw such a queer fellow in my life.\"\n\n\"Don't you know old Bolus? Well, I thought every one in Barsetshire\nknew Bolus; you especially should do so, as he is such a dear friend\nof Dr Thorne.\"\n\n\"A dear friend of Dr Thorne?\"\n\n\"Yes; he was apothecary at Scarington in the old days, before Dr\nFillgrave came into vogue. I remember when Bolus was thought to be a\nvery good sort of doctor.\"\n\n\"Is he--is he--\" whispered Frank, \"is he by way of a gentleman?\"\n\n\"Ha! ha! ha! Well, I suppose we must be charitable, and say that he\nis quite as good, at any rate, as many others there are here--\" and\nMr Athill, as he spoke, whispered into Frank's ear, \"You see there's\nFinnie here, another Barchester attorney. Now, I really think where\nFinnie goes Bolus may go too.\"\n\n\"The more the merrier, I suppose,\" said Frank.\n\n\"Well, something a little like that. I wonder why Thorne is not here?\nI'm sure he was asked.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he did not particularly wish to meet Finnie and Bolus. Do\nyou know, Mr Athill, I think he was quite right not to come. As for\nmyself, I wish I was anywhere else.\"\n\n\"Ha! ha! ha! You don't know the duke's ways yet; and what's more,\nyou're young, you happy fellow! But Thorne should have more sense; he\nought to show himself here.\"\n\nThe gormandizing was now going on at a tremendous rate. Though the\nvolubility of their tongues had been for a while stopped by the first\nshock of the duke's presence, the guests seemed to feel no such\nconstraint upon their teeth. They fed, one may almost say, rabidly,\nand gave their orders to the servants in an eager manner; much more\nimpressive than that usual at smaller parties. Mr Apjohn, who sat\nimmediately opposite to Frank, had, by some well-planned manoeuvre,\ncontrived to get before him the jowl of a salmon; but, unfortunately,\nhe was not for a while equally successful in the article of sauce. A\nvery limited portion--so at least thought Mr Apjohn--had been put on\nhis plate; and a servant, with a huge sauce tureen, absolutely passed\nbehind his back inattentive to his audible requests. Poor Mr Apjohn\nin his despair turned round to arrest the man by his coat-tails; but\nhe was a moment too late, and all but fell backwards on the floor. As\nhe righted himself he muttered an anathema, and looked with a face of\nanguish at his plate.\n\n\"Anything the matter, Apjohn?\" said Mr Fothergill, kindly, seeing\nthe utter despair written on the poor man's countenance; \"can I get\nanything for you?\"\n\n\"The sauce!\" said Mr Apjohn, in a voice that would have melted a\nhermit; and as he looked at Mr Fothergill, he pointed at the now\ndistant sinner, who was dispensing his melted ambrosia at least ten\nheads upwards, away from the unfortunate supplicant.\n\nMr Fothergill, however, knew where to look for balm for such wounds,\nand in a minute or two, Mr Apjohn was employed quite to his heart's\ncontent.\n\n\"Well,\" said Frank to his neighbour, \"it may be very well once in a\nway; but I think that on the whole Dr Thorne is right.\"\n\n\"My dear Mr Gresham, see the world on all sides,\" said Mr Athill,\nwho had also been somewhat intent on the gratification of his own\nappetite, though with an energy less evident than that of the\ngentleman opposite. \"See the world on all sides if you have an\nopportunity; and, believe me, a good dinner now and then is a very\ngood thing.\"\n\n\"Yes; but I don't like eating it with hogs.\"\n\n\"Whish-h! softly, softly, Mr Gresham, or you'll disturb Mr Apjohn's\ndigestion. Upon my word, he'll want it all before he has done. Now, I\nlike this kind of thing once in a way.\"\n\n\"Do you?\" said Frank, in a tone that was almost savage.\n\n\"Yes; indeed I do. One sees so much character. And after all, what\nharm does it do?\"\n\n\"My idea is that people should live with those whose society is\npleasant to them.\"\n\n\"Live--yes, Mr Gresham--I agree with you there. It wouldn't do for me\nto live with the Duke of Omnium; I shouldn't understand, or probably\napprove, his ways. Nor should I, perhaps, much like the constant\npresence of Mr Apjohn. But now and then--once in a year or so--I do\nown I like to see them both. Here's the cup; now, whatever you do, Mr\nGresham, don't pass the cup without tasting it.\"\n\nAnd so the dinner passed on, slowly enough as Frank thought, but\nall too quickly for Mr Apjohn. It passed away, and the wine came\ncirculating freely. The tongues again were loosed, the teeth being\nreleased from their labours, and under the influence of the claret\nthe duke's presence was forgotten.\n\nBut very speedily the coffee was brought. \"This will soon be over\nnow,\" said Frank, to himself, thankfully; for, though he be no means\ndespised good claret, he had lost his temper too completely to enjoy\nit at the present moment. But he was much mistaken; the farce as yet\nwas only at its commencement. The duke took his cup of coffee, and so\ndid the few friends who sat close to him; but the beverage did not\nseem to be in great request with the majority of the guests. When the\nduke had taken his modicum, he rose up and silently retired, saying\nno word and making no sign. And then the farce commenced.\n\n\"Now, gentlemen,\" said Mr Fothergill, cheerily, \"we are all right.\nApjohn, is there claret there? Mr Bolus, I know you stick to the\nMadeira; you are quite right, for there isn't much of it left, and my\nbelief is there'll never be more like it.\"\n\nAnd so the duke's hospitality went on, and the duke's guests drank\nmerrily for the next two hours.\n\n\"Shan't we see any more of him?\" asked Frank.\n\n\"Any more of whom?\" said Mr Athill.\n\n\"Of the duke?\"\n\n\"Oh, no; you'll see no more of him. He always goes when the coffee\ncomes. It's brought in as an excuse. We've had enough of the light of\nhis countenance to last till next year. The duke and I are excellent\nfriends; and have been so these fifteen years; but I never see more\nof him than that.\"\n\n\"I shall go away,\" said Frank.\n\n\"Nonsense. Mr de Courcy and your other friend won't stir for this\nhour yet.\"\n\n\"I don't care. I shall walk on, and they may catch me. I may be\nwrong; but it seems to me that a man insults me when he asks me to\ndine with him and never speaks to me. I don't care if he be ten times\nDuke of Omnium; he can't be more than a gentleman, and as such I\nam his equal.\" And then, having thus given vent to his feelings in\nsomewhat high-flown language, he walked forth and trudged away along\nthe road towards Courcy.\n\nFrank Gresham had been born and bred a Conservative, whereas the\nDuke of Omnium was well known as a consistent Whig. There is no one\nso devoutly resolved to admit of no superior as your Conservative,\nborn and bred, no one so inclined to high domestic despotism as your\nthoroughgoing consistent old Whig.\n\nWhen he had proceeded about six miles, Frank was picked up by his\nfriends; but even then his anger had hardly cooled.\n\n\"Was the duke as civil as ever when you took your leave of him?\" said\nhe to his cousin George, as he took his seat on the drag.\n\n\"The juke was jeuced jude wine--lem me tell you that, old fella,\"\nhiccupped out the Honourable George, as he touched up the leader\nunder the flank.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nThe Proposal\n\n\nAnd now the departures from Courcy Castle came rapidly one after\nanother, and there remained but one more evening before Miss\nDunstable's carriage was to be packed. The countess, in the early\nmoments of Frank's courtship, had controlled his ardour and checked\nthe rapidity of his amorous professions; but as days, and at last\nweeks, wore away, she found that it was necessary to stir the fire\nwhich she had before endeavoured to slacken.\n\n\"There will be nobody here to-night but our own circle,\" said she to\nhim, \"and I really think you should tell Miss Dunstable what your\nintentions are. She will have fair ground to complain of you if you\ndo not.\"\n\nFrank began to feel that he was in a dilemma. He had commenced making\nlove to Miss Dunstable partly because he liked the amusement, and\npartly from a satirical propensity to quiz his aunt by appearing to\nfall into her scheme. But he had overshot the mark, and did not know\nwhat answer to give when he was thus called upon to make a downright\nproposal. And then, although he did not care two rushes about Miss\nDunstable in the way of love, he nevertheless experienced a sort of\njealousy when he found that she appeared to be indifferent to him,\nand that she corresponded the meanwhile with his cousin George.\nThough all their flirtations had been carried on on both sides\npalpably by way of fun, though Frank had told himself ten times a\nday that his heart was true to Mary Thorne, yet he had an undefined\nfeeling that it behoved Miss Dunstable to be a little in love with\nhim. He was not quite at ease in that she was not a little melancholy\nnow that his departure was so nigh; and, above all, he was anxious to\nknow what were the real facts about that letter. He had in his own\nbreast threatened Miss Dunstable with a heartache; and now, when the\ntime for their separation came, he found that his own heart was the\nmore likely to ache of the two.\n\n\"I suppose I must say something to her, or my aunt will never be\nsatisfied,\" said he to himself as he sauntered into the little\ndrawing-room on that last evening. But at the very time he was\nashamed of himself, for he knew he was going to ask badly.\n\nHis sister and one of his cousins were in the room, but his aunt, who\nwas quite on the alert, soon got them out of it, and Frank and Miss\nDunstable were alone.\n\n\"So all our fun and all our laughter is come to an end,\" said she,\nbeginning the conversation. \"I don't know how you feel, but for\nmyself I really am a little melancholy at the idea of parting;\" and\nshe looked up at him with her laughing black eyes, as though she\nnever had, and never could have a care in the world.\n\n\"Melancholy! oh, yes; you look so,\" said Frank, who really did feel\nsomewhat lackadaisically sentimental.\n\n\"But how thoroughly glad the countess must be that we are both\ngoing,\" continued she. \"I declare we have treated her most\ninfamously. Ever since we've been here we've had all the amusement\nto ourselves. I've sometimes thought she would turn me out of the\nhouse.\"\n\n\"I wish with all my heart she had.\"\n\n\"Oh, you cruel barbarian! why on earth should you wish that?\"\n\n\"That I might have joined you in your exile. I hate Courcy Castle,\nand should have rejoiced to leave--and--and--\"\n\n\"And what?\"\n\n\"And I love Miss Dunstable, and should have doubly, trebly rejoiced\nto leave it with her.\"\n\nFrank's voice quivered a little as he made this gallant profession;\nbut still Miss Dunstable only laughed the louder. \"Upon my word, of\nall my knights you are by far the best behaved,\" said she, \"and say\nmuch the prettiest things.\" Frank became rather red in the face, and\nfelt that he did so. Miss Dunstable was treating him like a boy.\nWhile she pretended to be so fond of him she was only laughing at\nhim, and corresponding the while with his cousin George. Now Frank\nGresham already entertained a sort of contempt for his cousin, which\nincreased the bitterness of his feelings. Could it really be possible\nthat George had succeeded while he had utterly failed; that his\nstupid cousin had touched the heart of the heiress while she was\nplaying with him as with a boy?\n\n\"Of all your knights! Is that the way you talk to me when we are\ngoing to part? When was it, Miss Dunstable, that George de Courcy\nbecame one of them?\"\n\nMiss Dunstable for a while looked serious enough. \"What makes you ask\nthat?\" said she. \"What makes you inquire about Mr de Courcy?\"\n\n\"Oh, I have eyes, you know, and can't help seeing. Not that I see, or\nhave seen anything that I could possibly help.\"\n\n\"And what have you seen, Mr Gresham?\"\n\n\"Why, I know you have been writing to him.\"\n\n\"Did he tell you so?\"\n\n\"No; he did not tell me; but I know it.\"\n\nFor a moment she sat silent, and then her face again resumed its\nusual happy smile. \"Come, Mr Gresham, you are not going to quarrel\nwith me, I hope, even if I did write a letter to your cousin. Why\nshould I not write to him? I correspond with all manner of people.\nI'll write to you some of these days if you'll let me, and will\npromise to answer my letters.\"\n\nFrank threw himself back on the sofa on which he was sitting, and, in\ndoing so, brought himself somewhat nearer to his companion than he\nhad been; he then drew his hand slowly across his forehead, pushing\nback his thick hair, and as he did so he sighed somewhat plaintively.\n\n\"I do not care,\" said he, \"for the privilege of correspondence on\nsuch terms. If my cousin George is to be a correspondent of yours\nalso, I will give up my claim.\"\n\nAnd then he sighed again, so that it was piteous to hear him. He was\ncertainly an arrant puppy, and an egregious ass into the bargain;\nbut then, it must be remembered in his favour that he was only\ntwenty-one, and that much had been done to spoil him. Miss Dunstable\ndid remember this, and therefore abstained from laughing at him.\n\n\"Why, Mr Gresham, what on earth do you mean? In all human probability\nI shall never write another line to Mr de Courcy; but, if I did, what\npossible harm could it do you?\"\n\n\"Oh, Miss Dunstable! you do not in the least understand what my\nfeelings are.\"\n\n\"Don't I? Then I hope I never shall. I thought I did. I thought they\nwere the feelings of a good, true-hearted friend; feelings that I\ncould sometimes look back upon with pleasure as being honest when\nso much that one meets is false. I have become very fond of you, Mr\nGresham, and I should be sorry to think that I did not understand\nyour feelings.\"\n\nThis was almost worse and worse. Young ladies like Miss\nDunstable--for she was still to be numbered in the category of young\nladies--do not usually tell young gentlemen that they are very fond\nof them. To boys and girls they may make such a declaration. Now\nFrank Gresham regarded himself as one who had already fought his\nbattles, and fought them not without glory; he could not therefore\nendure to be thus openly told by Miss Dunstable that she was very\nfond of him.\n\n\"Fond of me, Miss Dunstable! I wish you were.\"\n\n\"So I am--very.\"\n\n\"You little know how fond I am of you, Miss Dunstable,\" and he put\nout his hand to take hold of hers. She then lifted up her own, and\nslapped him lightly on the knuckles.\n\n\"And what can you have to say to Miss Dunstable that can make it\nnecessary that you should pinch her hand? I tell you fairly, Mr\nGresham, if you make a fool of yourself, I shall come to a conclusion\nthat you are all fools, and that it is hopeless to look out for any\none worth caring for.\"\n\nSuch advice as this, so kindly given, so wisely meant, so clearly\nintelligible, he should have taken and understood, young as he was.\nBut even yet he did not do so.\n\n\"A fool of myself! Yes; I suppose I must be a fool if I have so much\nregard for Miss Dunstable as to make it painful for me to know that I\nam to see her no more: a fool: yes, of course I am a fool--a man is\nalways a fool when he loves.\"\n\nMiss Dunstable could not pretend to doubt his meaning any longer; and\nwas determined to stop him, let it cost what it would. She now put\nout her hand, not over white, and, as Frank soon perceived, gifted\nwith a very fair allowance of strength.\n\n\"Now, Mr Gresham,\" said she, \"before you go any further you shall\nlisten to me. Will you listen to me for a moment without interrupting\nme?\"\n\nFrank was of course obliged to promise that he would do so.\n\n\"You are going--or rather you were going, for I shall stop you--to\nmake a profession of love.\"\n\n\"A profession!\" said Frank making a slight unsuccessful effort to get\nhis hand free.\n\n\"Yes; a profession--a false profession, Mr Gresham,--a false\nprofession--a false profession. Look into your heart--into your heart\nof hearts. I know you at any rate have a heart; look into it closely.\nMr Gresham, you know you do not love me; not as a man should love the\nwoman whom he swears to love.\"\n\nFrank was taken aback. So appealed to he found that he could not any\nlonger say that he did love her. He could only look into her face\nwith all his eyes, and sit there listening to her.\n\n\"How is it possible that you should love me? I am Heaven knows how\nmany years your senior. I am neither young nor beautiful, nor have I\nbeen brought up as she should be whom you in time will really love\nand make your wife. I have nothing that should make you love me;\nbut--but I am rich.\"\n\n\"It is not that,\" said Frank, stoutly, feeling himself imperatively\ncalled upon to utter something in his own defence.\n\n\"Ah, Mr Gresham, I fear it is that. For what other reason can you\nhave laid your plans to talk in this way to such a woman as I am?\"\n\n\"I have laid no plans,\" said Frank, now getting his hand to himself.\n\"At any rate, you wrong me there, Miss Dunstable.\"\n\n\"I like you so well--nay, love you, if a woman may talk of love in\nthe way of friendship--that if money, money alone would make you\nhappy, you should have it heaped on you. If you want it, Mr Gresham,\nyou shall have it.\"\n\n\"I have never thought of your money,\" said Frank, surlily.\n\n\"But it grieves me,\" continued she, \"it does grieve me, to think that\nyou, you, you--so young, so gay, so bright--that you should have\nlooked for it in this way. From others I have taken it just as the\nwind that whistles;\" and now two big slow tears escaped from her\neyes, and would have rolled down her rosy cheeks were it not that she\nbrushed them off with the back of her hand.\n\n\"You have utterly mistaken me, Miss Dunstable,\" said Frank.\n\n\"If I have, I will humbly beg your pardon,\" said she.\n\"But--but--but--\"\n\n\"You have; indeed you have.\"\n\n\"How can I have mistaken you? Were you not about to say that you\nloved me; to talk absolute nonsense; to make me an offer? If you were\nnot, if I have mistaken you indeed, I will beg your pardon.\"\n\nFrank had nothing further to say in his own defence. He had not\nwanted Miss Dunstable's money--that was true; but he could not deny\nthat he had been about to talk that absolute nonsense of which she\nspoke with so much scorn.\n\n\"You would almost make me think that there are none honest in this\nfashionable world of yours. I well know why Lady de Courcy has had\nme here: how could I help knowing it? She has been so foolish in\nher plans that ten times a day she has told her own secret. But I\nhave said to myself twenty times, that if she were crafty, you were\nhonest.\"\n\n\"And am I dishonest?\"\n\n\"I have laughed in my sleeve to see how she played her game, and to\nhear others around playing theirs; all of them thinking that they\ncould get the money of the poor fool who had come at their beck and\ncall; but I was able to laugh at them as long as I thought that I had\none true friend to laugh with me. But one cannot laugh with all the\nworld against one.\"\n\n\"I am not against you, Miss Dunstable.\"\n\n\"Sell yourself for money! why, if I were a man I would not sell one\njot of liberty for mountains of gold. What! tie myself in the heyday\nof my youth to a person I could never love, for a price! perjure\nmyself, destroy myself--and not only myself, but her also, in order\nthat I might live idly! Oh, heavens! Mr Gresham! can it be that\nthe words of such a woman as your aunt have sunk so deeply in your\nheart; have blackened you so foully as to make you think of such vile\nfolly as this? Have you forgotten your soul, your spirit, your man's\nenergy, the treasure of your heart? And you, so young! For shame, Mr\nGresham! for shame--for shame.\"\n\nFrank found the task before him by no means an easy one. He had to\nmake Miss Dunstable understand that he had never had the slightest\nidea of marrying her, and that he had made love to her merely with\nthe object of keeping his hand in for the work as it were; with that\nobject, and the other equally laudable one of interfering with his\ncousin George.\n\nAnd yet there was nothing for him but to get through this task as\nbest he might. He was goaded to it by the accusations which Miss\nDunstable brought against him; and he began to feel, that though her\ninvective against him might be bitter when he had told the truth,\nthey could not be so bitter as those she now kept hinting at under\nher mistaken impression as to his views. He had never had any strong\npropensity for money-hunting; but now that offence appeared in his\neyes abominable, unmanly, and disgusting. Any imputation would be\nbetter than that.\n\n\"Miss Dunstable, I never for a moment thought of doing what\nyou accuse me of; on my honour, I never did. I have been very\nfoolish--very wrong--idiotic, I believe; but I have never intended\nthat.\"\n\n\"Then, Mr Gresham, what did you intend?\"\n\nThis was rather a difficult question to answer; and Frank was not\nvery quick in attempting it. \"I know you will not forgive me,\" he\nsaid at last; \"and, indeed, I do not see how you can. I don't know\nhow it came about; but this is certain, Miss Dunstable; I have never\nfor a moment thought about your fortune; that is, thought about it in\nthe way of coveting it.\"\n\n\"You never thought of making me your wife, then?\"\n\n\"Never,\" said Frank, looking boldly into her face.\n\n\"You never intended really to propose to go with me to the altar, and\nthen make yourself rich by one great perjury?\"\n\n\"Never for a moment,\" said he.\n\n\"You have never gloated over me as the bird of prey gloats over the\npoor beast that is soon to become carrion beneath its claws? You have\nnot counted me out as equal to so much land, and calculated on me as\na balance at your banker's? Ah, Mr Gresham,\" she continued, seeing\nthat he stared as though struck almost with awe by her strong\nlanguage; \"you little guess what a woman situated as I am has to\nsuffer.\"\n\n\"I have behaved badly to you, Miss Dunstable, and I beg your pardon;\nbut I have never thought of your money.\"\n\n\"Then we will be friends again, Mr Gresham, won't we? It is so nice\nto have a friend like you. There, I think I understand it now; you\nneed not tell me.\"\n\n\"It was half by way of making a fool of my aunt,\" said Frank, in an\napologetic tone.\n\n\"There is merit in that, at any rate,\" said Miss Dunstable. \"I\nunderstand it all now; you thought to make a fool of me in real\nearnest. Well, I can forgive that; at any rate it is not mean.\"\n\nIt may be, that Miss Dunstable did not feel much acute anger at\nfinding that this young man had addressed her with words of love in\nthe course of an ordinary flirtation, although that flirtation had\nbeen unmeaning and silly. This was not the offence against which her\nheart and breast had found peculiar cause to arm itself; this was not\nthe injury from which she had hitherto experienced suffering.\n\nAt any rate, she and Frank again became friends, and, before the\nevening was over, they perfectly understood each other. Twice during\nthis long _t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aate_ Lady de Courcy came into the room to see how\nthings were going on, and twice she went out almost unnoticed. It\nwas quite clear to her that something uncommon had taken place, was\ntaking place, or would take place; and that should this be for weal\nor for woe, no good could now come from her interference. On each\noccasion, therefore, she smiled sweetly on the pair of turtle-doves,\nand glided out of the room as quietly as she had glided into it.\n\nBut at last it became necessary to remove them; for the world had\ngone to bed. Frank, in the meantime, had told to Miss Dunstable all\nhis love for Mary Thorne, and Miss Dunstable had enjoined him to be\ntrue to his vows. To her eyes there was something of heavenly beauty\nin young, true love--of beauty that was heavenly because it had been\nunknown to her.\n\n\"Mind you let me hear, Mr Gresham,\" said she. \"Mind you do; and, Mr\nGresham, never, never forget her for one moment; not for one moment,\nMr Gresham.\"\n\nFrank was about to swear that he never would--again, when the\ncountess, for the third time, sailed into the room.\n\n\"Young people,\" said she, \"do you know what o'clock it is?\"\n\n\"Dear me, Lady de Courcy, I declare it is past twelve; I really am\nashamed of myself. How glad you will be to get rid of me to-morrow!\"\n\n\"No, no, indeed we shan't; shall we, Frank?\" and so Miss Dunstable\npassed out.\n\nThen once again the aunt tapped her nephew with her fan. It was the\nlast time in her life that she did so. He looked up in her face, and\nhis look was enough to tell her that the acres of Greshamsbury were\nnot to be reclaimed by the ointment of Lebanon.\n\nNothing further on the subject was said. On the following morning\nMiss Dunstable took her departure, not much heeding the rather cold\nwords of farewell which her hostess gave her; and on the following\nday Frank started for Greshamsbury.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nMr Moffat Falls into Trouble\n\n\nWe will now, with the reader's kind permission, skip over some months\nin our narrative. Frank returned from Courcy Castle to Greshamsbury,\nand having communicated to his mother--much in the same manner as he\nhad to the countess--the fact that his mission had been unsuccessful,\nhe went up after a day or two to Cambridge. During his short stay at\nGreshamsbury he did not even catch a glimpse of Mary. He asked for\nher, of course, and was told that it was not likely that she would be\nat the house just at present. He called at the doctor's, but she was\ndenied to him there; \"she was out,\" Janet said,--\"probably with Miss\nOriel.\" He went to the parsonage and found Miss Oriel at home; but\nMary had not been seen that morning. He then returned to the house;\nand, having come to the conclusion that she had not thus vanished\ninto air, otherwise than by preconcerted arrangement, he boldly taxed\nBeatrice on the subject.\n\nBeatrice looked very demure; declared that no one in the house had\nquarrelled with Mary; confessed that it had been thought prudent that\nshe should for a while stay away from Greshamsbury; and, of course,\nended by telling her brother everything, including all the scenes\nthat had passed between Mary and herself.\n\n\"It is out of the question your thinking of marrying her, Frank,\"\nsaid she. \"You must know that nobody feels it more strongly than\npoor Mary herself;\" and Beatrice looked the very personification of\ndomestic prudence.\n\n\"I know nothing of the kind,\" said he, with the headlong imperative\nair that was usual with him in discussing matters with his sisters.\n\"I know nothing of the kind. Of course I cannot say what Mary's\nfeelings may be: a pretty life she must have had of it among you. But\nyou may be sure of this, Beatrice, and so may my mother, that nothing\non earth shall make me give her up--nothing.\" And Frank, as he made\nthe protestation, strengthened his own resolution by thinking of all\nthe counsel that Miss Dunstable had given him.\n\nThe brother and sister could hardly agree, as Beatrice was dead\nagainst the match. Not that she would not have liked Mary Thorne for\na sister-in-law, but that she shared to a certain degree the feeling\nwhich was now common to all the Greshams--that Frank must marry\nmoney. It seemed, at any rate, to be imperative that he should either\ndo that or not marry at all. Poor Beatrice was not very mercenary\nin her views: she had no wish to sacrifice her brother to any\nMiss Dunstable; but yet she felt, as they all felt--Mary Thorne\nincluded--that such a match as that, of the young heir with the\ndoctor's niece, was not to be thought of;--not to be spoken of as\na thing that was in any way possible. Therefore, Beatrice, though\nshe was Mary's great friend, though she was her brother's favourite\nsister, could give Frank no encouragement. Poor Frank! circumstances\nhad made but one bride possible to him: he must marry money.\n\nHis mother said nothing to him on the subject: when she learnt that\nthe affair with Miss Dunstable was not to come off, she merely\nremarked that it would perhaps be best for him to return to Cambridge\nas soon as possible. Had she spoken her mind out, she would probably\nhave also advised him to remain there as long as possible. The\ncountess had not omitted to write to her when Frank left Courcy\nCastle; and the countess's letter certainly made the anxious mother\nthink that her son's education had hardly yet been completed. With\nthis secondary object, but with that of keeping him out of the way of\nMary Thorne in the first place, Lady Arabella was now quite satisfied\nthat her son should enjoy such advantages as an education completed\nat the university might give him.\n\nWith his father Frank had a long conversation; but, alas! the gist of\nhis father's conversation was this, that it behoved him, Frank, to\nmarry money. The father, however, did not put it to him in the cold,\ncallous way in which his lady-aunt had done, and his lady-mother.\nHe did not bid him go and sell himself to the first female he could\nfind possessed of wealth. It was with inward self-reproaches, and\ntrue grief of spirit, that the father told the son that it was not\npossible for him to do as those may do who are born really rich, or\nreally poor.\n\n\"If you marry a girl without a fortune, Frank, how are you to live?\"\nthe father asked, after having confessed how deep he himself had\ninjured his own heir.\n\n\"I don't care about money, sir,\" said Frank. \"I shall be just as\nhappy as if Boxall Hill had never been sold. I don't care a straw\nabout that sort of thing.\"\n\n\"Ah! my boy; but you will care: you will soon find that you do care.\"\n\n\"Let me go into some profession. Let me go to the Bar. I am sure I\ncould earn my own living. Earn it! of course I could, why not I as\nwell as others? I should like of all things to be a barrister.\"\n\nThere was much more of the same kind, in which Frank said all that he\ncould think of to lessen his father's regrets. In their conversation\nnot a word was spoken about Mary Thorne. Frank was not aware whether\nor no his father had been told of the great family danger which was\ndreaded in that quarter. That he had been told, we may surmise, as\nLady Arabella was not wont to confine the family dangers to her own\nbosom. Moreover, Mary's presence had, of course, been missed. The\ntruth was, that the squire had been told, with great bitterness, of\nwhat had come to pass, and all the evil had been laid at his door.\nHe it had been who had encouraged Mary to be regarded almost as a\ndaughter of the house of Greshamsbury; he it was who taught that\nodious doctor--odious in all but his aptitude for good doctoring--to\nthink himself a fit match for the aristocracy of the county. It had\nbeen his fault, this great necessity that Frank should marry money;\nand now it was his fault that Frank was absolutely talking of\nmarrying a pauper.\n\nBy no means in quiescence did the squire hear these charges brought\nagainst him. The Lady Arabella, in each attack, got quite as much as\nshe gave, and, at last, was driven to retreat in a state of headache,\nwhich she declared to be chronic; and which, so she assured her\ndaughter Augusta, must prevent her from having any more lengthened\nconversations with her lord--at any rate for the next three months.\nBut though the squire may be said to have come off on the whole as\nvictor in these combats, they did not perhaps have, on that account,\nthe less effect upon him. He knew it was true that he had done much\ntowards ruining his son; and he also could think of no other remedy\nthan matrimony. It was Frank's doom, pronounced even by the voice of\nhis father, that he must marry money.\n\nAnd so, Frank went off again to Cambridge, feeling himself, as he\nwent, to be a much lesser man in Greshamsbury estimation than he had\nbeen some two months earlier, when his birthday had been celebrated.\nOnce during his short stay at Greshamsbury he had seen the doctor;\nbut the meeting had been anything but pleasant. He had been afraid\nto ask after Mary; and the doctor had been too diffident of himself\nto speak of her. They had met casually on the road, and, though each\nin his heart loved the other, the meeting had been anything but\npleasant.\n\nAnd so Frank went back to Cambridge; and, as he did so, he stoutly\nresolved that nothing should make him untrue to Mary Thorne.\n\"Beatrice,\" said he, on the morning he went away, when she came into\nhis room to superintend his packing--\"Beatrice, if she ever talks\nabout me--\"\n\n\"Oh, Frank, my darling Frank, don't think of it--it is madness; she\nknows it is madness.\"\n\n\"Never mind; if she ever talks about me, tell her that the last word\nI said was, that I would never forget her. She can do as she likes.\"\n\nBeatrice made no promise, never hinted that she would give the\nmessage; but it may be taken for granted that she had not been long\nin company with Mary Thorne before she did give it.\n\nAnd then there were other troubles at Greshamsbury. It had been\ndecided that Augusta's marriage was to take place in September; but\nMr Moffat had, unfortunately, been obliged to postpone the happy day.\nHe himself had told Augusta--not, of course, without protestations\nas to his regret--and had written to this effect to Mr Gresham,\n\"Electioneering matters, and other troubles had,\" he said, \"made this\npeculiarly painful postponement absolutely necessary.\"\n\nAugusta seemed to bear her misfortune with more equanimity than is,\nwe believe, usual with young ladies under such circumstances. She\nspoke of it to her mother in a very matter-of-fact way, and seemed\nalmost contented at the idea of remaining at Greshamsbury till\nFebruary; which was the time now named for the marriage. But Lady\nArabella was not equally well satisfied, nor was the squire.\n\n\"I half believe that fellow is not honest,\" he had once said out loud\nbefore Frank, and this set Frank a-thinking of what dishonesty in the\nmatter it was probable that Mr Moffat might be guilty, and what would\nbe the fitting punishment for such a crime. Nor did he think on the\nsubject in vain; especially after a conference on the matter which he\nhad with his friend Harry Baker. This conference took place during\nthe Christmas vacation.\n\nIt should be mentioned, that the time spent by Frank at Courcy Castle\nhad not done much to assist him in his views as to an early degree,\nand that it had at last been settled that he should stay up at\nCambridge another year. When he came home at Christmas he found that\nthe house was not peculiarly lively. Mary was absent on a visit with\nMiss Oriel. Both these young ladies were staying with Miss Oriel's\naunt, in the neighbourhood of London; and Frank soon learnt that\nthere was no chance that either of them would be home before his\nreturn. No message had been left for him by Mary--none at least had\nbeen left with Beatrice; and he began in his heart to accuse her of\ncoldness and perfidy;--not, certainly, with much justice, seeing that\nshe had never given him the slightest encouragement.\n\nThe absence of Patience Oriel added to the dullness of the place. It\nwas certainly hard upon Frank that all the attraction of the village\nshould be removed to make way and prepare for his return--harder,\nperhaps, on them; for, to tell the truth, Miss Oriel's visit had been\nentirely planned to enable her to give Mary a comfortable way of\nleaving Greshamsbury during the time that Frank should remain at\nhome. Frank thought himself cruelly used. But what did Mr Oriel think\nwhen doomed to eat his Christmas pudding alone, because the young\nsquire would be unreasonable in his love? What did the doctor think,\nas he sat solitary by his deserted hearth--the doctor, who no\nlonger permitted himself to enjoy the comforts of the Greshamsbury\ndining-table? Frank hinted and grumbled; talked to Beatrice of the\ndetermined constancy of his love, and occasionally consoled himself\nby a stray smile from some of the neighbouring belles. The black\nhorse was made perfect; the old grey pony was by no means discarded;\nand much that was satisfactory was done in the sporting line. But\nstill the house was dull, and Frank felt that he was the cause of\nits being so. Of the doctor he saw but little: he never came to\nGreshamsbury unless to see Lady Arabella as doctor, or to be closeted\nwith the squire. There were no social evenings with him; no animated\nconfabulations at the doctor's house; no discourses between them,\nas there had wont to be, about the merits of the different covers,\nand the capacities of the different hounds. These were dull days on\nthe whole for Frank; and sad enough, we may say, for our friend the\ndoctor.\n\nIn February, Frank again went back to college; having settled with\nHarry Baker certain affairs which weighed on his mind. He went back\nto Cambridge, promising to be home on the 20th of the month, so as to\nbe present at his sister's wedding. A cold and chilling time had been\nnamed for these hymeneal joys, but one not altogether unsuited to the\nfeelings of the happy pair. February is certainly not a warm month;\nbut with the rich it is generally a cosy, comfortable time. Good\nfires, winter cheer, groaning tables, and warm blankets, make a\nfictitious summer, which, to some tastes, is more delightful than\nthe long days and the hot sun. And some marriages are especially\nwinter matches. They depend for their charm on the same substantial\nattractions: instead of heart beating to heart in sympathetic unison,\npurse chinks to purse. The rich new furniture of the new abode is\nlooked to instead of the rapture of a pure embrace. The new carriage\nis depended on rather than the new heart's companion; and the first\nbright gloss, prepared by the upholsterer's hands, stands in lieu of\nthe rosy tints which young love lends to his true votaries.\n\nMr Moffat had not spent his Christmas at Greshamsbury. That eternal\nelection petition, those eternal lawyers, the eternal care of his\nwell-managed wealth, forbade him the enjoyment of any such pleasures.\nHe could not come to Greshamsbury for Christmas, nor yet for the\nfestivities of the new year; but now and then he wrote prettily\nworded notes, sending occasionally a silver-gilt pencil-case, or a\nsmall brooch, and informed Lady Arabella that he looked forward to\nthe 20th of February with great satisfaction. But, in the meanwhile,\nthe squire became anxious, and at last went up to London; and Frank,\nwho was at Cambridge, bought the heaviest cutting whip to be found in\nthat town, and wrote a confidential letter to Harry Baker.\n\nPoor Mr Moffat! It is well known that none but the brave deserve the\nfair; but thou, without much excuse for bravery, had secured for\nthyself one who, at any rate, was fair enough for thee. Would it\nnot have been well hadst thou looked into thyself to see what real\nbravery might be in thee, before thou hadst prepared to desert this\nfair one thou hadst already won? That last achievement, one may say,\ndid require some special courage.\n\nPoor Mr Moffat! It is wonderful that as he sat in that gig, going to\nGatherum Castle, planning how he would be off with Miss Gresham and\nafterwards on with Miss Dunstable, it is wonderful that he should not\nthen have cast his eye behind him, and looked at that stalwart pair\nof shoulders which were so close to his own back. As he afterwards\npondered on his scheme while sipping the duke's claret, it is odd\nthat he should not have observed the fiery pride of purpose and power\nof wrath which was so plainly written on that young man's brow: or,\nwhen he matured, and finished, and carried out his purpose, that he\ndid not think of that keen grasp which had already squeezed his own\nhand with somewhat too warm a vigour, even in the way of friendship.\n\nPoor Mr Moffat! it is probable that he forgot to think of Frank at\nall as connected with his promised bride; it is probable that he\nlooked forward only to the squire's violence and the enmity of the\nhouse of Courcy; and that he found from enquiry at his heart's\npulses, that he was man enough to meet these. Could he have guessed\nwhat a whip Frank Gresham would have bought at Cambridge--could he\nhave divined what a letter would have been written to Harry Baker--it\nis probable, nay, we think we may say certain, that Miss Gresham\nwould have become Mrs Moffat.\n\nMiss Gresham, however, never did become Mrs Moffat. About two days\nafter Frank's departure for Cambridge--it is just possible that Mr\nMoffat was so prudent as to make himself aware of the fact--but just\ntwo days after Frank's departure, a very long, elaborate, and clearly\nexplanatory letter was received at Greshamsbury. Mr Moffat was quite\nsure that Miss Gresham and her very excellent parents would do him\nthe justice to believe that he was not actuated, &c., &c., &c.\nThe long and the short of this was, that Mr Moffat signified his\nintention of breaking off the match without offering any intelligible\nreason.\n\nAugusta again bore her disappointment well: not, indeed, without\nsorrow and heartache, and inward, hidden tears; but still well. She\nneither raved, nor fainted, nor walked about by moonlight alone. She\nwrote no poetry, and never once thought of suicide. When, indeed, she\nremembered the rosy-tinted lining, the unfathomable softness of that\nLong-acre carriage, her spirit did for one moment give way; but, on\nthe whole, she bore it as a strong-minded woman and a de Courcy\nshould do.\n\nBut both Lady Arabella and the squire were greatly vexed. The former\nhad made the match, and the latter, having consented to it, had\nincurred deeper responsibilities to enable him to bring it about.\nThe money which was to have been given to Mr Moffat was still to the\nfore; but alas! how much, how much that he could ill spare, had been\nthrown away on bridal preparations! It is, moreover, an unpleasant\nthing for a gentleman to have his daughter jilted; perhaps peculiarly\nso to have her jilted by a tailor's son.\n\nLady Arabella's woe was really piteous. It seemed to her as though\ncruel fate were heaping misery after misery upon the wretched house\nof Greshamsbury. A few weeks since things were going so well with\nher! Frank then was all but the accepted husband of almost untold\nwealth--so, at least, she was informed by her sister-in-law--whereas,\nAugusta, was the accepted wife of wealth, not indeed untold, but of\ndimensions quite sufficiently respectable to cause much joy in the\ntelling. Where now were her golden hopes? Where now the splendid\nfuture of her poor duped children? Augusta was left to pine alone;\nand Frank, in a still worse plight, insisted on maintaining his love\nfor a bastard and a pauper.\n\nFor Frank's affair she had received some poor consolation by laying\nall the blame on the squire's shoulders. What she had then said\nwas now repaid to her with interest; for not only had she been the\nmaker of Augusta's match, but she had boasted of the deed with all a\nmother's pride.\n\nIt was from Beatrice that Frank had obtained his tidings. This last\nresolve on the part of Mr Moffat had not altogether been unsuspected\nby some of the Greshams, though altogether unsuspected by the Lady\nArabella. Frank had spoken of it as a possibility to Beatrice,\nand was not quite unprepared when the information reached him. He\nconsequently bought his big cutting whip, and wrote his confidential\nletter to Harry Baker.\n\nOn the following day Frank and Harry might have been seen, with their\nheads nearly close together, leaning over one of the tables in the\nlarge breakfast-room at the Tavistock Hotel in Covent Garden. The\nominous whip, to the handle of which Frank had already made his hand\nwell accustomed, was lying on the table between them; and ever and\nanon Harry Baker would take it up and feel its weight approvingly.\nOh, Mr Moffat! poor Mr Moffat! go not out into the fashionable world\nto-day; above all, go not to that club of thine in Pall Mall; but,\noh! especially go not there, as is thy wont to do, at three o'clock\nin the afternoon!\n\nWith much care did those two young generals lay their plans of\nattack. Let it not for a moment be thought that it was ever in the\nminds of either of them that two men should attack one. But it\nwas thought that Mr Moffat might be rather coy in coming out from\nhis seclusion to meet the proffered hand of his once intended\nbrother-in-law when he should see that hand armed with a heavy whip.\nBaker, therefore, was content to act as a decoy duck, and remarked\nthat he might no doubt make himself useful in restraining the public\nmercy, and, probably, in controlling the interference of policemen.\n\n\"It will be deuced hard if I can't get five or six shies at him,\"\nsaid Frank, again clutching his weapon almost spasmodically. Oh, Mr\nMoffat! five or six shies with such a whip, and such an arm! For\nmyself, I would sooner join in a second Balaclava gallop than\nencounter it.\n\nAt ten minutes before four these two heroes might be seen walking up\nPall Mall, towards the ---- Club. Young Baker walked with an eager\ndisengaged air. Mr Moffat did not know his appearance; he had,\ntherefore, no anxiety to pass along unnoticed. But Frank had in some\nmysterious way drawn his hat very far over his forehead, and had\nbuttoned his shooting-coat up round his chin. Harry had recommended\nto him a great-coat, in order that he might the better conceal his\nface; but Frank had found that the great-coat was an encumbrance to\nhis arm. He put it on, and when thus clothed he had tried the whip,\nhe found that he cut the air with much less potency than in the\nlighter garment. He contented himself, therefore, with looking down\non the pavement as he walked along, letting the long point of the\nwhip stick up from his pocket, and flattering himself that even Mr\nMoffat would not recognise him at the first glance. Poor Mr Moffat!\nIf he had but had the chance!\n\nAnd now, having arrived at the front of the club, the two friends for\na moment separate: Frank remains standing on the pavement, under the\nshade of the high stone area-railing, while Harry jauntily skips up\nthree steps at a time, and with a very civil word of inquiry of the\nhall porter, sends in his card to Mr Moffat--\n\n\n   MR HARRY BAKER\n\n\nMr Moffat, never having heard of such a gentleman in his life,\nunwittingly comes out into the hall, and Harry, with the sweetest\nsmile, addresses him.\n\nNow the plan of the campaign had been settled in this wise: Baker\nwas to send into the club for Mr Moffat, and invite that gentleman\ndown into the street. It was probable that the invitation might\nbe declined; and it had been calculated in such case that the two\ngentlemen would retire for parley into the strangers' room, which was\nknown to be immediately opposite the hall door. Frank was to keep his\neye on the portals, and if he found that Mr Moffat did not appear\nas readily as might be desired, he also was to ascend the steps and\nhurry into the strangers' room. Then, whether he met Mr Moffat there\nor elsewhere, or wherever he might meet him, he was to greet him with\nall the friendly vigour in his power, while Harry disposed of the\nclub porters.\n\nBut fortune, who ever favours the brave, specially favoured Frank\nGresham on this occasion. Just as Harry Baker had put his card\ninto the servant's hand, Mr Moffat, with his hat on, prepared for\nthe street, appeared in the hall; Mr Baker addressed him with his\nsweetest smile, and begged the pleasure of saying a word or two as\nthey descended into the street. Had not Mr Moffat been going thither\nit would have been very improbable that he should have done so at\nHarry's instance. But, as it was, he merely looked rather solemn\nat his visitor--it was his wont to look solemn--and continued the\ndescent of the steps.\n\nFrank, his heart leaping the while, saw his prey, and retreated two\nsteps behind the area-railing, the dread weapon already well poised\nin his hand. Oh! Mr Moffat! Mr Moffat! if there be any goddess to\ninterfere in thy favour, let her come forward now without delay; let\nher now bear thee off on a cloud if there be one to whom thou art\nsufficiently dear! But there is no such goddess.\n\nHarry smiled blandly till they were well on the pavement, saying some\nnothing, and keeping the victim's face averted from the avenging\nangel; and then, when the raised hand was sufficiently nigh, he\nwithdrew two steps towards the nearest lamp-post. Not for him was the\nhonour of the interview;--unless, indeed, succouring policemen might\ngive occasion for some gleam of glory.\n\nBut succouring policemen were no more to be come by than goddesses.\nWhere were ye, men, when that savage whip fell about the ears of the\npoor ex-legislator? In Scotland Yard, sitting dozing on your benches,\nor talking soft nothings to the housemaids round the corner; for ye\nwere not walking on your beats, nor standing at coign of vantage, to\nwatch the tumults of the day. But had ye been there what could ye\nhave done? Had Sir Richard himself been on the spot Frank Gresham\nwould still, we may say, have had his five shies at that unfortunate\none.\n\nWhen Harry Baker quickly seceded from the way, Mr Moffat at once saw\nthe fate before him. His hair doubtless stood on end, and his voice\nrefused to give the loud screech with which he sought to invoke the\nclub. An ashy paleness suffused his cheeks, and his tottering steps\nwere unable to bear him away in flight. Once, and twice, the cutting\nwhip came well down across his back. Had he been wise enough to stand\nstill and take his thrashing in that attitude, it would have been\nwell for him. But men so circumstanced have never such prudence.\nAfter two blows he made a dash at the steps, thinking to get back\ninto the club; but Harry, who had by no means reclined in idleness\nagainst the lamp-post, here stopped him: \"You had better go back into\nthe street,\" said Harry; \"indeed you had,\" giving him a shove from\noff the second step.\n\nThen of course Frank could not do other than hit him anywhere. When a\ngentleman is dancing about with much energy it is hardly possible to\nstrike him fairly on his back. The blows, therefore, came now on his\nlegs and now on his head; and Frank unfortunately got more than his\nfive or six shies before he was interrupted.\n\nThe interruption however came, all too soon for Frank's idea of\njustice. Though there be no policeman to take part in a London row,\nthere are always others ready enough to do so; amateur policemen,\nwho generally sympathise with the wrong side, and, in nine cases\nout of ten, expend their generous energy in protecting thieves and\npickpockets. When it was seen with what tremendous ardour that\ndread weapon fell about the ears of the poor undefended gentleman,\ninterference there was at last, in spite of Harry Baker's best\nendeavours, and loudest protestations.\n\n\"Do not interrupt them, sir,\" said he; \"pray do not. It is a family\naffair, and they will neither of them like it.\"\n\nIn the teeth, however, of these assurances, rude people did\ninterfere, and after some nine or ten shies Frank found himself\nencompassed by the arms, and encumbered by the weight of a very stout\ngentleman, who hung affectionately about his neck and shoulders;\nwhereas, Mr Moffat was already receiving consolation from two\nmotherly females, sitting in a state of syncope on the good-natured\nknees of a fishmonger's apprentice.\n\nFrank was thoroughly out of breath: nothing came from his lips but\nhalf-muttered expletives and unintelligible denunciations of the\niniquity of his foe. But still he struggled to be at him again. We\nall know how dangerous is the taste of blood; now cruelty will become\na custom even with the most tender-hearted. Frank felt that he had\nhardly fleshed his virgin lash: he thought, almost with despair, that\nhe had not yet at all succeeded as became a man and a brother; his\nmemory told him of but one or two of the slightest touches that had\ngone well home to the offender. He made a desperate effort to throw\noff that incubus round his neck and rush again to the combat.\n\n\"Harry--Harry; don't let him go--don't let him go,\" he barely\narticulated.\n\n\"Do you want to murder the man, sir; to murder him?\" said the stout\ngentleman over his shoulder, speaking solemnly into his very ear.\n\n\"I don't care,\" said Frank, struggling manfully but uselessly. \"Let\nme out, I say; I don't care--don't let him go, Harry, whatever you\ndo.\"\n\n\"He has got it prettily tidily,\" said Harry; \"I think that will\nperhaps do for the present.\"\n\nBy this time there was a considerable concourse. The club steps were\ncrowded with the members; among whom there were many of Mr Moffat's\nacquaintance. Policemen also now flocked up, and the question arose\nas to what should be done with the originators of the affray. Frank\nand Harry found that they were to consider themselves under a gentle\narrest, and Mr Moffat, in a fainting state, was carried into the\ninterior of the club.\n\nFrank, in his innocence, had intended to have celebrated this little\naffair when it was over by a light repast and a bottle of claret\nwith his friend, and then to have gone back to Cambridge by the mail\ntrain. He found, however, that his schemes in this respect were\nfrustrated. He had to get bail to attend at Marlborough Street\npolice-office should he be wanted within the next two or three days;\nand was given to understand that he would be under the eye of the\npolice, at any rate until Mr Moffat should be out of danger.\n\n\"Out of danger!\" said Frank to his friend with a startled look.\n\"Why I hardly got at him.\" Nevertheless, they did have their slight\nrepast, and also their bottle of claret.\n\nOn the second morning after this occurrence, Frank was again sitting\nin that public room at the Tavistock, and Harry was again sitting\nopposite to him. The whip was not now so conspicuously produced\nbetween them, having been carefully packed up and put away among\nFrank's other travelling properties. They were so sitting, rather\nglum, when the door swung open, and a heavy, quick step was heard\nadvancing towards them. It was the squire; whose arrival there had\nbeen momentarily expected.\n\n\"Frank,\" said he--\"Frank, what on earth is all this?\" and as he spoke\nhe stretched out both hands, the right to his son and the left to his\nfriend.\n\n\"He has given a blackguard a licking, that is all,\" said Harry.\n\nFrank felt that his hand was held with a peculiarly warm grasp; and\nhe could not but think that his father's face, raised though his\neyebrows were--though there was on it an intended expression of\namazement and, perhaps, regret--nevertheless he could not but think\nthat his father's face looked kindly at him.\n\n\"God bless my soul, my dear boy! what have you done to the man?\"\n\n\"He's not a ha'porth the worse, sir,\" said Frank, still holding his\nfather's hand.\n\n\"Oh, isn't he!\" said Harry, shrugging his shoulders. \"He must be made\nof some very tough article then.\"\n\n\"But my dear boys, I hope there's no danger. I hope there's no\ndanger.\"\n\n\"Danger!\" said Frank, who could not yet induce himself to believe\nthat he had been allowed a fair chance with Mr Moffat.\n\n\"Oh, Frank! Frank! how could you be so rash? In the middle of Pall\nMall, too. Well! well! well! All the women down at Greshamsbury will\nhave it that you have killed him.\"\n\n\"I almost wish I had,\" said Frank.\n\n\"Oh, Frank! Frank! But now tell me--\"\n\nAnd then the father sat well pleased while he heard, chiefly from\nHarry Baker, the full story of his son's prowess. And then they did\nnot separate without another slight repast and another bottle of\nclaret.\n\nMr Moffat retired to the country for a while, and then went abroad;\nhaving doubtless learnt that the petition was not likely to give him\na seat for the city of Barchester. And this was the end of the wooing\nwith Miss Gresham.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nSir Roger Is Unseated\n\n\nAfter this, little occurred at Greshamsbury, or among Greshamsbury\npeople, which it will be necessary for us to record. Some notice was,\nof course, taken of Frank's prolonged absence from his college; and\ntidings, perhaps exaggerated tidings, of what had happened in Pall\nMall were not slow to reach the High Street of Cambridge. But that\naffair was gradually hushed up; and Frank went on with his studies.\n\nHe went back to his studies: it then being an understood arrangement\nbetween him and his father that he should not return to Greshamsbury\ntill the summer vacation. On this occasion, the squire and Lady\nArabella had, strange to say, been of the same mind. They both wished\nto keep their son away from Miss Thorne; and both calculated, that\nat his age and with his disposition, it was not probable that any\npassion would last out a six months' absence. \"And when the summer\ncomes it will be an excellent opportunity for us to go abroad,\" said\nLady Arabella. \"Poor Augusta will require some change to renovate her\nspirits.\"\n\nTo this last proposition the squire did not assent. It was, however,\nallowed to pass over; and this much was fixed, that Frank was not to\nreturn home till midsummer.\n\nIt will be remembered that Sir Roger Scatcherd had been elected\nas sitting member for the city of Barchester; but it will also be\nremembered that a petition against his return was threatened. Had\nthat petition depended solely on Mr Moffat, Sir Roger's seat no doubt\nwould have been saved by Frank Gresham's cutting whip. But such\nwas not the case. Mr Moffat had been put forward by the de Courcy\ninterest; and that noble family with its dependants was not to go to\nthe wall because Mr Moffat had had a thrashing. No; the petition was\nto go on; and Mr Nearthewinde declared, that no petition in his hands\nhad half so good a chance of success. \"Chance, no, but certainty,\"\nsaid Mr Nearthewinde; for Mr Nearthewinde had learnt something with\nreference to that honest publican and the payment of his little bill.\n\nThe petition was presented and duly backed; the recognisances were\nsigned, and all the proper formalities formally executed; and Sir\nRoger found that his seat was in jeopardy. His return had been a\ngreat triumph to him; and, unfortunately, he had celebrated that\ntriumph as he had been in the habit of celebrating most of the very\ntriumphant occasions of his life. Though he was than hardly yet\nrecovered from the effects of his last attack, he indulged in another\nviolent drinking bout; and, strange to say, did so without any\nimmediate visible bad effects.\n\nIn February he took his seat amidst the warm congratulations of\nall men of his own class, and early in the month of April his case\ncame on for trial. Every kind of electioneering sin known to the\nelectioneering world was brought to his charge; he was accused of\nfalseness, dishonesty, and bribery of every sort: he had, it was said\nin the paper of indictment, bought votes, obtained them by treating,\ncarried them off by violence, conquered them by strong drink, polled\nthem twice over, counted those of dead men, stolen them, forged them,\nand created them by every possible, fictitious contrivance: there was\nno description of wickedness appertaining to the task of procuring\nvotes of which Sir Roger had not been guilty, either by himself or\nby his agents. He was quite horror-struck at the list of his own\nenormities. But he was somewhat comforted when Mr Closerstil told him\nthat the meaning of it all was that Mr Romer, the barrister, had paid\na former bill due to Mr Reddypalm, the publican.\n\n\"I fear he was indiscreet, Sir Roger; I really fear he was. Those\nyoung men always are. Being energetic, they work like horses; but\nwhat's the use of energy without discretion, Sir Roger?\"\n\n\"But, Mr Closerstil, I knew nothing about it from first to last.\"\n\n\"The agency can be proved, Sir Roger,\" said Mr Closerstil, shaking\nhis head. And then there was nothing further to be said on the\nmatter.\n\nIn these days of snow-white purity all political delinquency is\nabominable in the eyes of British politicians; but no delinquency is\nso abominable as that of venality at elections. The sin of bribery is\ndamnable. It is the one sin for which, in the House of Commons, there\ncan be no forgiveness. When discovered, it should render the culprit\nliable to political death, without hope of pardon. It is treason\nagainst a higher throne than that on which the Queen sits. It is a\nheresy which requires an _auto-da-f\u00c3\u00a9_. It is a pollution to the whole\nHouse, which can only be cleansed by a great sacrifice. Anathema\nmaranatha! out with it from amongst us, even though the half of our\nheart's blood be poured forth in the conflict! out with it, and for\never!\n\nSuch is the language of patriotic members with regard to bribery;\nand doubtless, if sincere, they are in the right. It is a bad thing,\ncertainly, that a rich man should buy votes; bad also that a poor man\nshould sell them. By all means let us repudiate such a system with\nheartfelt disgust.\n\nWith heartfelt disgust, if we can do so, by all means; but not with\ndisgust pretended only and not felt in the heart at all. The laws\nagainst bribery at elections are now so stringent that an unfortunate\ncandidate may easily become guilty, even though actuated by the\npurest intentions. But not the less on that account does any\ngentleman, ambitious of the honour of serving his country in\nParliament, think it necessary as a preliminary measure to provide\na round sum of money at his banker's. A candidate must pay for no\ntreating, no refreshments, no band of music; he must give neither\nribbons to the girls nor ale to the men. If a huzza be uttered in\nhis favour, it is at his peril; it may be necessary for him to prove\nbefore a committee that it was the spontaneous result of British\nfeeling in his favour, and not the purchased result of British beer.\nHe cannot safely ask any one to share his hotel dinner. Bribery hides\nitself now in the most impalpable shapes, and may be effected by the\noffer of a glass of sherry. But not the less on this account does a\npoor man find that he is quite unable to overcome the difficulties of\na contested election.\n\nWe strain at our gnats with a vengeance, but we swallow our camels\nwith ease. For what purpose is it that we employ those peculiarly\nsafe men of business--Messrs Nearthewinde and Closerstil--when we\nwish to win our path through all obstacles into that sacred recess,\nif all be so open, all so easy, all so much above board? Alas! the\nmoney is still necessary, is still prepared, or at any rate expended.\nThe poor candidate of course knows nothing of the matter till the\nattorney's bill is laid before him, when all danger of petitions has\npassed away. He little dreamed till then, not he, that there had been\nbanquetings and junketings, secret doings and deep drinkings at his\nexpense. Poor candidate! Poor member! Who was so ignorant as he!\n'Tis true he has paid such bills before; but 'tis equally true that\nhe specially begged his managing friend, Mr Nearthewinde, to be\nvery careful that all was done according to law! He pays the bill,\nhowever, and on the next election will again employ Mr Nearthewinde.\n\nNow and again, at rare intervals, some glimpse into the inner\nsanctuary does reach the eyes of ordinary mortal men without;\nsome slight accidental peep into those mysteries from whence\nall corruption has been so thoroughly expelled; and then, how\ndelightfully refreshing is the sight, when, perhaps, some ex-member,\nhurled from his paradise like a fallen peri, reveals the secret of\nthat pure heaven, and, in the agony of his despair, tells us all\nthat it cost him to sit for ---- through those few halcyon years!\n\nBut Mr Nearthewinde is a safe man, and easy to be employed with but\nlittle danger. All these stringent bribery laws only enhance the\nvalue of such very safe men as Mr Nearthewinde. To him, stringent\nlaws against bribery are the strongest assurance of valuable\nemployment. Were these laws of a nature to be evaded with ease, any\nindifferent attorney might manage a candidate's affairs and enable\nhim to take his seat with security.\n\nIt would have been well for Sir Roger if he had trusted solely to\nMr Closerstil; well also for Mr Romer had he never fished in those\ntroubled waters. In due process of time the hearing of the petition\ncame on, and then who so happy, sitting at his ease at his London\nInn, blowing his cloud from a long pipe, with measureless content, as\nMr Reddypalm? Mr Reddypalm was the one great man of the contest. All\ndepended on Mr Reddypalm; and well he did his duty.\n\nThe result of the petition was declared by the committee to be as\nfollows:--that Sir Roger's election was null and void--that the\nelection altogether was null and void--that Sir Roger had, by his\nagent, been guilty of bribery in obtaining a vote, by the payment\nof a bill alleged to have been previously refused payment--that Sir\nRoger himself knew nothing about it;--this is always a matter of\ncourse;--but that Sir Roger's agent, Mr Romer, had been wittingly\nguilty of bribery with reference to the transaction above described.\nPoor Sir Roger! Poor Mr Romer.\n\nPoor Mr Romer indeed! His fate was perhaps as sad as well might be,\nand as foul a blot to the purism of these very pure times in which\nwe live. Not long after those days, it so happening that some\nconsiderable amount of youthful energy and quidnunc ability were\nrequired to set litigation afloat at Hong-Kong, Mr Romer was sent\nthither as the fittest man for such work, with rich assurance of\nfuture guerdon. Who so happy then as Mr Romer! But even among the\npure there is room for envy and detraction. Mr Romer had not yet\nceased to wonder at new worlds, as he skimmed among the islands of\nthat southern ocean, before the edict had gone forth for his return.\nThere were men sitting in that huge court of Parliament on whose\nbreasts it lay as an intolerable burden, that England should be\nrepresented among the antipodes by one who had tampered with the\npurity of the franchise. For them there was no rest till this great\ndisgrace should be wiped out and atoned for. Men they were of that\ncalibre, that the slightest reflection on them of such a stigma\nseemed to themselves to blacken their own character. They could not\nbreak bread with satisfaction till Mr Romer was recalled. He was\nrecalled, and of course ruined--and the minds of those just men were\nthen at peace.\n\nTo any honourable gentleman who really felt his brow suffused with\na patriotic blush, as he thought of his country dishonoured by Mr\nRomer's presence at Hong-Kong--to any such gentleman, if any such\nthere were, let all honour be given, even though the intensity of his\npurity may create amazement to our less finely organised souls. But\nif no such blush suffused the brow of any honourable gentleman; if Mr\nRomer was recalled from quite other feelings--what then in lieu of\nhonour shall we allot to those honourable gentlemen who were most\nconcerned?\n\nSir Roger, however, lost his seat, and, after three months of the\njoys of legislation, found himself reduced by a terrible blow to the\nlow level of private life.\n\nAnd the blow to him was very heavy. Men but seldom tell the truth of\nwhat is in them, even to their dearest friends; they are ashamed of\nhaving feelings, or rather of showing that they are troubled by any\nintensity of feeling. It is the practice of the time to treat all\npursuits as though they were only half important to us, as though\nin what we desire we were only half in earnest. To be visibly eager\nseems childish, and is always bad policy; and men, therefore,\nnowadays, though they strive as hard as ever in the service of\nambition--harder than ever in that of mammon--usually do so with\na pleasant smile on, as though after all they were but amusing\nthemselves with the little matter in hand.\n\nPerhaps it had been so with Sir Roger in those electioneering days\nwhen he was looking for votes. At any rate, he had spoken of his seat\nin Parliament as but a doubtful good. \"He was willing, indeed, to\nstand, having been asked; but the thing would interfere wonderfully\nwith his business; and then, what did he know about Parliament?\nNothing on earth: it was the maddest scheme, but nevertheless, he was\nnot going to hang back when called upon--he had always been rough and\nready when wanted,--and there he was now ready as ever, and rough\nenough too, God knows.\"\n\n'Twas thus that he had spoken of his coming parliamentary honours;\nand men had generally taken him at his word. He had been returned,\nand this success had been hailed as a great thing for the cause and\nclass to which he belonged. But men did not know that his inner heart\nwas swelling with triumph, and that his bosom could hardly contain\nhis pride as he reflected that the poor Barchester stone-mason was\nnow the representative in Parliament of his native city. And so, when\nhis seat was attacked, he still laughed and joked. \"They were welcome\nto it for him,\" he said; \"he could keep it or want it; and of the\ntwo, perhaps, the want of it would come most convenient to him. He\ndid not exactly think that he had bribed any one; but if the bigwigs\nchose to say so, it was all one to him. He was rough and ready, now\nas ever,\" &c., &c.\n\nBut when the struggle came, it was to him a fearful one; not the\nless fearful because there was no one, no, not one friend in all the\nworld, to whom he could open his mind and speak out honestly what\nwas in his heart. To Dr Thorne he might perhaps have done so had his\nintercourse with the doctor been sufficiently frequent; but it was\nonly now and again when he was ill, or when the squire wanted to\nborrow money, that he saw Dr Thorne. He had plenty of friends, heaps\nof friends in the parliamentary sense; friends who talked about\nhim, and lauded him at public meetings; who shook hands with him on\nplatforms, and drank his health at dinners; but he had no friend\nwho could sit with him over his own hearth, in true friendship, and\nlisten to, and sympathise with, and moderate the sighings of the\ninner man. For him there was no sympathy; no tenderness of love; no\nretreat, save into himself, from the loud brass band of the outer\nworld.\n\nThe blow hit him terribly hard. It did not come altogether\nunexpectedly, and yet, when it did come, it was all but unendurable.\nHe had made so much of the power of walking into that august chamber,\nand sitting shoulder to shoulder in legislative equality with the\nsons of dukes and the curled darlings of the nation. Money had given\nhim nothing, nothing but the mere feeling of brute power: with his\nthree hundred thousand pounds he had felt himself to be no more\npalpably near to the goal of his ambition than when he had chipped\nstones for three shillings and sixpence a day. But when he was led up\nand introduced at that table, when he shook the old premier's hand\non the floor of the House of Commons, when he heard the honourable\nmember for Barchester alluded to in grave debate as the greatest\nliving authority on railway matters, then, indeed, he felt that he\nhad achieved something.\n\nAnd now this cup was ravished from his lips, almost before it was\ntasted. When he was first told as a certainty that the decision of\nthe committee was against him, he bore up against the misfortune like\na man. He laughed heartily, and declared himself well rid of a very\nprofitless profession; cut some little joke about Mr Moffat and his\nthrashing, and left on those around him an impression that he was\na man so constituted, so strong in his own resolves, so steadily\npursuant of his own work, that no little contentions of this kind\ncould affect him. Men admired his easy laughter, as, shuffling his\nhalf-crowns with both his hands in his trouser-pockets, he declared\nthat Messrs Romer and Reddypalm were the best friends he had known\nfor this many a day.\n\nBut not the less did he walk out from the room in which he was\nstanding a broken-hearted man. Hope could not buoy him up as she may\ndo other ex-members in similarly disagreeable circumstances. He could\nnot afford to look forward to what further favours parliamentary\nfuture might have in store for him after a lapse of five or six\nyears. Five or six years! Why, his life was not worth four years'\npurchase; of that he was perfectly aware: he could not now live\nwithout the stimulus of brandy; and yet, while he took it, he knew he\nwas killing himself. Death he did not fear; but he would fain have\nwished, after his life of labour, to have lived, while yet he could\nlive, in the blaze of that high world to which for a moment he had\nattained.\n\nHe laughed loud and cheerily as he left his parliamentary friends,\nand, putting himself into the train, went down to Boxall Hill. He\nlaughed loud and cheerily; but he never laughed again. It had not\nbeen his habit to laugh much at Boxall Hill. It was there he kept his\nwife, and Mr Winterbones, and the brandy bottle behind his pillow. He\nhad not often there found it necessary to assume that loud and cheery\nlaugh.\n\nOn this occasion he was apparently well in health when he got home;\nbut both Lady Scatcherd and Mr Winterbones found him more than\nordinarily cross. He made an affectation at sitting very hard to\nbusiness, and even talked of going abroad to look at some of his\nforeign contracts. But even Winterbones found that his patron did not\nwork as he had been wont to do; and at last, with some misgivings, he\ntold Lady Scatcherd that he feared that everything was not right.\n\n\"He's always at it, my lady, always,\" said Mr Winterbones.\n\n\"Is he?\" said Lady Scatcherd, well understanding what Mr\nWinterbones's allusion meant.\n\n\"Always, my lady. I never saw nothing like it. Now, there's me--I can\nalways go my half-hour when I've had my drop; but he, why, he don't\ngo ten minutes, not now.\"\n\nThis was not cheerful to Lady Scatcherd; but what was the poor woman\nto do? When she spoke to him on any subject he only snarled at her;\nand now that the heavy fit was on him, she did not dare even to\nmention the subject of his drinking. She had never known him so\nsavage in his humour as he was now, so bearish in his habits, so\nlittle inclined to humanity, so determined to rush headlong down,\nwith his head between his legs, into the bottomless abyss.\n\nShe thought of sending for Dr Thorne; but she did not know under what\nguise to send for him,--whether as doctor or as friend: under neither\nwould he now be welcome; and she well knew that Sir Roger was not the\nman to accept in good part either a doctor or a friend who might be\nunwelcome. She knew that this husband of hers, this man who, with\nall his faults, was the best of her friends, whom of all she loved\nbest--she knew that he was killing himself, and yet she could do\nnothing. Sir Roger was his own master, and if kill himself he would,\nkill himself he must.\n\nAnd kill himself he did. Not indeed by one sudden blow. He did not\ntake one huge dose of his consuming poison and then fall dead upon\nthe floor. It would perhaps have been better for himself, and better\nfor those around him, had he done so. No; the doctors had time to\ncongregate around his bed; Lady Scatcherd was allowed a period of\nnurse-tending; the sick man was able to say his last few words and\nbid adieu to his portion of the lower world with dying decency. As\nthese last words will have some lasting effect upon the surviving\npersonages of our story, the reader must be content to stand for a\nshort while by the side of Sir Roger's sick-bed, and help us to bid\nhim God-speed on the journey which lies before him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nRetrospective\n\n\nIt was declared in the early pages of this work that Dr Thorne was to\nbe our hero; but it would appear very much as though he had latterly\nbeen forgotten. Since that evening when he retired to rest without\nletting Mary share the grievous weight which was on his mind, we have\nneither seen nor heard aught of him.\n\nIt was then full midsummer, and it is now early spring: and during the\nintervening months the doctor had not had a happy time of it. On that\nnight, as we have before told, he took his niece to his heart; but\nhe could not then bring himself to tell her that which it was so\nimperative that she should know. Like a coward, he would put off\nthe evil hour till the next morning, and thus robbed himself of his\nnight's sleep.\n\nBut when the morning came the duty could not be postponed. Lady\nArabella had given him to understand that his niece would no longer\nbe a guest at Greshamsbury; and it was quite out of the question that\nMary, after this, should be allowed to put her foot within the gate\nof the domain without having learnt what Lady Arabella had said. So\nhe told it her before breakfast, walking round their little garden,\nshe with her hand in his.\n\nHe was perfectly thunderstruck by the collected--nay, cool way in\nwhich she received his tidings. She turned pale, indeed; he felt also\nthat her hand somewhat trembled in his own, and he perceived that\nfor a moment her voice shook; but no angry word escaped her lip, nor\ndid she even deign to repudiate the charge, which was, as it were,\nconveyed in Lady Arabella's request. The doctor knew, or thought he\nknew--nay, he did know--that Mary was wholly blameless in the matter:\nthat she had at least given no encouragement to any love on the part\nof the young heir; but, nevertheless, he had expected that she would\navouch her own innocence. This, however, she by no means did.\n\n\"Lady Arabella is quite right,\" she said, \"quite right; if she has\nany fear of that kind, she cannot be too careful.\"\n\n\"She is a selfish, proud woman,\" said the doctor; \"quite indifferent\nto the feelings of others; quite careless how deeply she may hurt her\nneighbours, if, in doing so, she may possibly benefit herself.\"\n\n\"She will not hurt me, uncle, nor yet you. I can live without going\nto Greshamsbury.\"\n\n\"But it is not to be endured that she should dare to cast an\nimputation on my darling.\"\n\n\"On me, uncle? She casts no imputation on me. Frank has been foolish:\nI have said nothing of it, for it was not worth while to trouble you.\nBut as Lady Arabella chooses to interfere, I have no right to blame\nher. He has said what he should not have said; he has been foolish.\nUncle, you know I could not prevent it.\"\n\n\"Let her send him away then, not you; let her banish him.\"\n\n\"Uncle, he is her son. A mother can hardly send her son away so\neasily: could you send me away, uncle?\"\n\nHe merely answered her by twining his arm round her waist and\npressing her to his side. He was well sure that she was badly\ntreated; and yet now that she so unaccountably took Lady Arabella's\npart, he hardly knew how to make this out plainly to be the case.\n\n\"Besides, uncle, Greshamsbury is in a manner his own; how can he be\nbanished from his father's house? No, uncle; there is an end of my\nvisits there. They shall find that I will not thrust myself in their\nway.\"\n\nAnd then Mary, with a calm brow and steady gait, went in and made the\ntea.\n\nAnd what might be the feelings of her heart when she so sententiously\ntold her uncle that Frank had been foolish? She was of the same age\nwith him; as impressionable, though more powerful in hiding such\nimpressions,--as all women should be; her heart was as warm, her\nblood as full of life, her innate desire for the companionship of\nsome much-loved object as strong as his. Frank had been foolish in\navowing his passion. No such folly as that could be laid at her door.\nBut had she been proof against the other folly? Had she been able to\nwalk heart-whole by his side, while he chatted his commonplaces about\nlove? Yes, they are commonplaces when we read of them in novels;\ncommon enough, too, to some of us when we write them; but they are by\nno means commonplace when first heard by a young girl in the rich,\nbalmy fragrance of a July evening stroll.\n\nNor are they commonplaces when so uttered for the first or second\ntime at least, or perhaps the third. 'Tis a pity that so heavenly a\npleasure should pall upon the senses.\n\nIf it was so that Frank's folly had been listened to with a certain\namount of pleasure, Mary did not even admit so much to herself. But\nwhy should it have been otherwise? Why should she have been less\nprone to love than he was? Had he not everything which girls do love?\nwhich girls should love? which God created noble, beautiful, all but\ngodlike, in order that women, all but goddesslike, might love? To\nlove thoroughly, truly, heartily, with her whole body, soul, heart,\nand strength; should not that be counted for a merit in a woman? And\nyet we are wont to make a disgrace of it. We do so most unnaturally,\nmost unreasonably; for we expect our daughters to get themselves\nmarried off our hands. When the period of that step comes, then love\nis proper enough; but up to that--before that--as regards all those\npreliminary passages which must, we suppose, be necessary--in all\nthose it becomes a young lady to be icy-hearted as a river-god in\nwinter.\n\n\n   O whistle and I'll come to you, my lad!\n   O whistle and I'll come to you, my lad!\n   Tho' father and mither and a' should go mad,\n   O whistle and I'll come to you, my lad!\n\n\nThis is the kind of love which a girl should feel before she puts her\nhand proudly in that of her lover, and consents that they two shall\nbe made one flesh.\n\nMary felt no such love as this. She, too, had some inner perception\nof that dread destiny by which it behoved Frank Gresham to be\nforewarned. She, too--though she had never heard so much said in\nwords--had an almost instinctive knowledge that his fate required him\nto marry money. Thinking over this in her own way, she was not slow\nto convince herself that it was out of the question that she should\nallow herself to love Frank Gresham. However well her heart might\nbe inclined to such a feeling, it was her duty to repress it. She\nresolved, therefore, to do so; and she sometimes flattered herself\nthat she had kept her resolution.\n\nThese were bad times for the doctor, and bad times for Mary too. She\nhad declared that she could live without going to Greshamsbury; but\nshe did not find it so easy. She had been going to Greshamsbury all\nher life, and it was as customary with her to be there as at home.\nSuch old customs are not broken without pain. Had she left the place\nit would have been far different; but, as it was, she daily passed\nthe gates, daily saw and spoke to some of the servants, who knew her\nas well as they did the young ladies of the family--was in hourly\ncontact, as it were, with Greshamsbury. It was not only that she\ndid not go there, but that everyone knew that she had suddenly\ndiscontinued doing so. Yes, she could live without going to\nGreshamsbury; but for some time she had but a poor life of it. She\nfelt, nay, almost heard, that every man and woman, boy and girl, in\nthe village was telling his and her neighbour that Mary Thorne no\nlonger went to the house because of Lady Arabella and the young\nsquire.\n\nBut Beatrice, of course, came to her. What was she to say to\nBeatrice? The truth! Nay, but it is not always so easy to say the\ntruth, even to one's dearest friends.\n\n\"But you'll come up now he has gone?\" said Beatrice.\n\n\"No, indeed,\" said Mary; \"that would hardly be pleasant to Lady\nArabella, nor to me either. No, Trichy, dearest; my visits to dear\nold Greshamsbury are done, done, done: perhaps in some twenty years'\ntime I may be walking down the lawn with your brother, and discussing\nour childish days--that is, always, if the then Mrs Gresham shall\nhave invited me.\"\n\n\"How can Frank have been so wrong, so unkind, so cruel?\" said\nBeatrice.\n\nThis, however, was a light in which Miss Thorne did not take any\npleasure in discussing the matter. Her ideas of Frank's fault, and\nunkindness, and cruelty, were doubtless different from those of his\nsister. Such cruelty was not unnaturally excused in her eyes by many\ncircumstances which Beatrice did not fully understand. Mary was quite\nready to go hand in hand with Lady Arabella and the rest of the\nGreshamsbury fold in putting an end, if possible, to Frank's passion:\nshe would give no one a right to accuse her of assisting to ruin the\nyoung heir; but she could hardly bring herself to admit that he was\nso very wrong--no, nor yet even so very cruel.\n\nAnd then the squire came to see her, and this was a yet harder trial\nthan the visit of Beatrice. It was so difficult for her to speak to\nhim that she could not but wish him away; and yet, had he not come,\nhad he altogether neglected her, she would have felt it to be unkind.\nShe had ever been his pet, had always received kindness from him.\n\n\"I am sorry for all this, Mary; very sorry,\" said he, standing up,\nand holding both her hands in his.\n\n\"It can't be helped, sir,\" said she, smiling.\n\n\"I don't know,\" said he; \"I don't know--it ought to be helped\nsomehow--I am quite sure you have not been to blame.\"\n\n\"No,\" said she, very quietly, as though the position was one quite\na matter of course. \"I don't think I have been very much to blame.\nThere will be misfortunes sometimes when nobody is to blame.\"\n\n\"I do not quite understand it all,\" said the squire; \"but if Frank--\"\n\n\"Oh! we will not talk about him,\" said she, still laughing gently.\n\n\"You can understand, Mary, how dear he must be to me; but if--\"\n\n\"Mr Gresham, I would not for worlds be the cause of any\nunpleasantness between you and him.\"\n\n\"But I cannot bear to think that we have banished you, Mary.\"\n\n\"It cannot be helped. Things will all come right in time.\"\n\n\"But you will be so lonely here.\"\n\n\"Oh! I shall get over all that. Here, you know, Mr Gresham, 'I am\nmonarch of all I survey;' and there is a great deal in that.\"\n\nThe squire did not quite catch her meaning, but a glimmering of it\ndid reach him. It was competent to Lady Arabella to banish her from\nGreshamsbury; it was within the sphere of the squire's duties to\nprohibit his son from an imprudent match; it was for the Greshams to\nguard their Greshamsbury treasure as best they could within their\nown territories: but let them beware that they did not attack her on\nhers. In obedience to the first expression of their wishes, she had\nsubmitted herself to this public mark of their disapproval because\nshe had seen at once, with her clear intellect, that they were only\ndoing that which her conscience must approve. Without a murmur,\ntherefore, she consented to be pointed at as the young lady who had\nbeen turned out of Greshamsbury because of the young squire. She had\nno help for it. But let them take care that they did not go beyond\nthat. Outside those Greshamsbury gates she and Frank Gresham, she\nand Lady Arabella met on equal terms; let them each fight their own\nbattle.\n\nThe squire kissed her forehead affectionately and took his leave,\nfeeling, somehow, that he had been excused and pitied, and made much\nof; whereas he had called on his young neighbour with the intention\nof excusing, and pitying, and making much of her. He was not\nquite comfortable as he left the house; but, nevertheless, he was\nsufficiently honest-hearted to own to himself that Mary Thorne was a\nfine girl. Only that it was so absolutely necessary that Frank should\nmarry money--and only, also, that poor Mary was such a birthless\nfoundling in the world's esteem--only, but for these things, what a\nwife she would have made for that son of his!\n\nTo one person only did she talk freely on the subject, and that one\nwas Patience Oriel; and even with her the freedom was rather of the\nmind than of the heart. She never said a word of her feeling with\nreference to Frank, but she said much of her position in the village,\nand of the necessity she was under to keep out of the way.\n\n\"It is very hard,\" said Patience, \"that the offence should be all\nwith him, and the punishment all with you.\"\n\n\"Oh! as for that,\" said Mary, laughing, \"I will not confess to any\noffence, nor yet to any punishment; certainly not to any punishment.\"\n\n\"It comes to the same thing in the end.\"\n\n\"No, not so, Patience; there is always some little sting of disgrace\nin punishment: now I am not going to hold myself in the least\ndisgraced.\"\n\n\"But, Mary, you must meet the Greshams sometimes.\"\n\n\"Meet them! I have not the slightest objection on earth to meet all,\nor any of them. They are not a whit dangerous to me, my dear. 'Tis\nI that am the wild beast, and 'tis they that must avoid me,\" and\nthen she added, after a pause--slightly blushing--\"I have not the\nslightest objection even to meet him if chance brings him in my way.\nLet them look to that. My undertaking goes no further than this, that\nI will not be seen within their gates.\"\n\nBut the girls so far understood each other that Patience undertook,\nrather than promised, to give Mary what assistance she could; and,\ndespite Mary's bravado, she was in such a position that she much\nwanted the assistance of such a friend as Miss Oriel.\n\nAfter an absence of some six weeks, Frank, as we have seen, returned\nhome. Nothing was said to him, except by Beatrice, as to these new\nGreshamsbury arrangements; and he, when he found Mary was not at the\nplace, went boldly to the doctor's house to seek her. But it has been\nseen, also, that she discreetly kept out of his way. This she had\nthought fit to do when the time came, although she had been so ready\nwith her boast that she had no objection on earth to meet him.\n\nAfter that there had been the Christmas vacation, and Mary had again\nfound discretion to be the better part of valour. This was doubtless\ndisagreeable enough. She had no particular wish to spend her\nChristmas with Miss Oriel's aunt instead of at her uncle's fireside.\nIndeed, her Christmas festivities had hitherto been kept at\nGreshamsbury, the doctor and herself having made a part of the family\ncircle there assembled. This was out of the question now; and perhaps\nthe absolute change to old Miss Oriel's house was better for her than\nthe lesser change to her uncle's drawing-room. Besides, how could she\nhave demeaned herself when she met Frank in their parish church? All\nthis had been fully understood by Patience, and, therefore, had this\nChristmas visit been planned.\n\nAnd then this affair of Frank and Mary Thorne ceased for a while to\nbe talked of at Greshamsbury, for that other affair of Mr Moffat and\nAugusta monopolised the rural attention. Augusta, as we have said,\nbore it well, and sustained the public gaze without much flinching.\nHer period of martyrdom, however, did not last long, for soon\nthe news arrived of Frank's exploit in Pall Mall; and then the\nGreshamsburyites forgot to think much more of Augusta, being fully\noccupied in thinking of what Frank had done.\n\nThe tale, as it was first told, declared that Frank had followed Mr\nMoffat up into his club; had dragged him thence into the middle of\nPall Mall, and had then slaughtered him on the spot. This was by\ndegrees modified till a sobered fiction became generally prevalent,\nthat Mr Moffat was lying somewhere, still alive, but with all his\nbones in a general state of compound fracture. This adventure again\nbrought Frank into the ascendant, and restored to Mary her former\nposition as the Greshamsbury heroine.\n\n\"One cannot wonder at his being very angry,\" said Beatrice,\ndiscussing the matter with Mary--very imprudently.\n\n\"Wonder--no; the wonder would have been if he had not been angry. One\nmight have been quite sure that he would have been angry enough.\"\n\n\"I suppose it was not absolutely right for him to beat Mr Moffat,\"\nsaid Beatrice, apologetically.\n\n\"Not right, Trichy? I think he was very right.\"\n\n\"Not to beat him so very much, Mary!\"\n\n\"Oh, I suppose a man can't exactly stand measuring how much he does\nthese things. I like your brother for what he has done, and I say\nso frankly--though I suppose I ought to eat my tongue out before I\nshould say such a thing, eh, Trichy?\"\n\n\"I don't know that there's any harm in that,\" said Beatrice,\ndemurely. \"If you both liked each other there would be no harm in\nthat--if that were all.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't there?\" said Mary, in a low tone of bantering satire; \"that\nis so kind, Trichy, coming from you--from one of the family, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"You are well aware, Mary, that if I could have my wishes--\"\n\n\"Yes: I am well aware what a paragon of goodness you are. If you\ncould have your way I should be admitted into heaven again; shouldn't\nI? Only with this proviso, that if a stray angel should ever whisper\nto me with bated breath, mistaking me, perchance, for one of his own\nclass, I should be bound to close my ears to his whispering, and\nremind him humbly that I was only a poor mortal. You would trust me\nso far, wouldn't you, Trichy?\"\n\n\"I would trust you in any way, Mary. But I think you are unkind in\nsaying such things to me.\"\n\n\"Into whatever heaven I am admitted, I will go only on this\nunderstanding: that I am to be as good an angel as any of those\naround me.\"\n\n\"But, Mary dear, why do you say this to me?\"\n\n\"Because--because--because--ah me! Why, indeed, but because I have no\none else to say it to. Certainly not because you have deserved it.\"\n\n\"It seems as though you were finding fault with me.\"\n\n\"And so I am; how can I do other than find fault? How can I help\nbeing sore? Trichy, you hardly realise my position; you hardly see\nhow I am treated; how I am forced to allow myself to be treated\nwithout a sign of complaint. You don't see it all. If you did, you\nwould not wonder that I should be sore.\"\n\nBeatrice did not quite see it all; but she saw enough of it to know\nthat Mary was to be pitied; so, instead of scolding her friend\nfor being cross, she threw her arms round her and kissed her\naffectionately.\n\nBut the doctor all this time suffered much more than his niece did.\nHe could not complain out loudly; he could not aver that his pet lamb\nhad been ill treated; he could not even have the pleasure of openly\nquarrelling with Lady Arabella; but not the less did he feel it to\nbe most cruel that Mary should have to live before the world as an\noutcast, because it had pleased Frank Gresham to fall in love with\nher.\n\nBut his bitterness was not chiefly against Frank. That Frank had been\nvery foolish he could not but acknowledge; but it was a kind of folly\nfor which the doctor was able to find excuse. For Lady Arabella's\ncold propriety he could find no excuse.\n\nWith the squire he had spoken no word on the subject up to this\nperiod of which we are now writing. With her ladyship he had never\nspoken on it since that day when she had told him that Mary was\nto come no more to Greshamsbury. He never now dined or spent his\nevenings at Greshamsbury, and seldom was to be seen at the house,\nexcept when called in professionally. The squire, indeed, he\nfrequently met; but he either did so in the village, or out on\nhorseback, or at his own house.\n\nWhen the doctor first heard that Sir Roger had lost his seat, and had\nreturned to Boxall Hill, he resolved to go over and see him. But the\nvisit was postponed from day to day, as visits are postponed which\nmay be made any day, and he did not in fact go till he was summoned\nthere somewhat peremptorily. A message was brought to him one evening\nto say that Sir Roger had been struck by paralysis, and that not a\nmoment was to be lost.\n\n\"It always happens at night,\" said Mary, who had more sympathy for\nthe living uncle whom she did know, than for the other dying uncle\nwhom she did not know.\n\n\"What matters?--there--just give me my scarf. In all probability I\nmay not be home to-night--perhaps not till late to-morrow. God bless\nyou, Mary!\" and away the doctor went on his cold bleak ride to Boxall\nHill.\n\n\"Who will be his heir?\" As the doctor rode along, he could not quite\nrid his mind of this question. The poor man now about to die had\nwealth enough to make many heirs. What if his heart should have\nsoftened towards his sister's child! What if Mary should be found in\na few days to be possessed of such wealth that the Greshams should be\nagain happy to welcome her at Greshamsbury!\n\nThe doctor was not a lover of money--and he did his best to get rid\nof such pernicious thoughts. But his longings, perhaps, were not so\nmuch that Mary should be rich, as that she should have the power of\nheaping coals of fire upon the heads of those people who had so\ninjured her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nLouis Scatcherd\n\n\nWhen Dr Thorne reached Boxall Hill he found Mr Rerechild from\nBarchester there before him. Poor Lady Scatcherd, when her husband\nwas stricken by the fit, hardly knew in her dismay what adequate\nsteps to take. She had, as a matter of course, sent for Dr Thorne;\nbut she had thought that in so grave a peril the medical skill of no\none man could suffice. It was, she knew, quite out of the question\nfor her to invoke the aid of Dr Fillgrave, whom no earthly persuasion\nwould have brought to Boxall Hill; and as Mr Rerechild was supposed\nin the Barchester world to be second--though at a long interval--to\nthat great man, she had applied for his assistance.\n\nNow Mr Rerechild was a follower and humble friend of Dr Fillgrave;\nand was wont to regard anything that came from the Barchester doctor\nas sure light from the lamp of \u00c3\u0086sculapius. He could not therefore be\nother than an enemy of Dr Thorne. But he was a prudent, discreet man,\nwith a long family, averse to professional hostilities, as knowing\nthat he could make more by medical friends than medical foes, and\nnot at all inclined to take up any man's cudgel to his own detriment.\nHe had, of course, heard of that dreadful affront which had been\nput upon his friend, as had all the \"medical world\"--all the\nmedical world at least of Barsetshire; and he had often expressed\nhis sympathy with Dr Fillgrave and his abhorrence of Dr Thorne's\nanti-professional practices. But now that he found himself about to\nbe brought in contact with Dr Thorne, he reflected that the Galen\nof Greshamsbury was at any rate equal in reputation to him of\nBarchester; that the one was probably on the rise, whereas the other\nwas already considered by some as rather antiquated; and he therefore\nwisely resolved that the present would be an excellent opportunity\nfor him to make a friend of Dr Thorne.\n\nPoor Lady Scatcherd had an inkling that Dr Fillgrave and Mr Rerechild\nwere accustomed to row in the same boat, and she was not altogether\nfree from fear that there might be an outbreak. She therefore took\nan opportunity before Dr Thorne's arrival to deprecate any wrathful\ntendency.\n\n\"Oh, Lady Scatcherd! I have the greatest respect for Dr Thorne,\"\nsaid he; \"the greatest possible respect; a most skilful\npractitioner--something brusque certainly, and perhaps a little\nobstinate. But what then? we all have our faults, Lady Scatcherd.\"\n\n\"Oh--yes; we all have, Mr Rerechild; that's certain.\"\n\n\"There's my friend Fillgrave--Lady Scatcherd. He cannot bear anything\nof that sort. Now I think he's wrong; and so I tell him.\" Mr\nRerechild was in error here; for he had never yet ventured to tell Dr\nFillgrave that he was wrong in anything. \"We must bear and forbear,\nyou know. Dr Thorne is an excellent man--in his way very excellent,\nLady Scatcherd.\"\n\nThis little conversation took place after Mr Rerechild's first visit\nto his patient: what steps were immediately taken for the relief of\nthe sufferer we need not describe. They were doubtless well intended,\nand were, perhaps, as well adapted to stave off the coming evil day\nas any that Dr Fillgrave, or even the great Sir Omicron Pie might\nhave used.\n\nAnd then Dr Thorne arrived.\n\n\"Oh, doctor! doctor!\" exclaimed Lady Scatcherd, almost hanging round\nhis neck in the hall. \"What are we to do? What are we to do? He's\nvery bad.\"\n\n\"Has he spoken?\"\n\n\"No; nothing like a word: he has made one or two muttered sounds;\nbut, poor soul, you could make nothing of it--oh, doctor! doctor! he\nhas never been like this before.\"\n\nIt was easy to see where Lady Scatcherd placed any such faith as she\nmight still have in the healing art. \"Mr Rerechild is here and has\nseen him,\" she continued. \"I thought it best to send for two, for\nfear of accidents. He has done something--I don't know what. But,\ndoctor, do tell the truth now; I look to you to tell me the truth.\"\n\nDr Thorne then went up and saw his patient; and had he literally\ncomplied with Lady Scatcherd's request, he might have told her at\nonce that there was no hope. As, however, he had not the heart to do\nthis, he mystified the case as doctors so well know how to do, and\ntold her that \"there was cause to fear, great cause for fear; he was\nsorry to say, very great cause for much fear.\"\n\nDr Thorne promised to stay the night there, and, if possible, the\nfollowing night also; and then Lady Scatcherd became troubled in her\nmind as to what she should do with Mr Rerechild. He also declared,\nwith much medical humanity, that, let the inconvenience be what it\nmight, he too would stay the night. \"The loss,\" he said, \"of such a\nman as Sir Roger Scatcherd was of such paramount importance as to\nmake other matters trivial. He would certainly not allow the whole\nweight to fall on the shoulders of his friend Dr Thorne: he also\nwould stay at any rate that night by the sick man's bedside. By the\nfollowing morning some change might be expected.\"\n\n\"I say, Dr Thorne,\" said her ladyship, calling the doctor into the\nhousekeeping-room, in which she and Hannah spent any time that they\nwere not required upstairs; \"just come in, doctor: you couldn't tell\nhim we don't want him any more, could you?\"\n\n\"Tell whom?\" said the doctor.\n\n\"Why--Mr Rerechild: mightn't he go away, do you think?\"\n\nDr Thorne explained that Mr Rerechild certainly might go away if he\npleased; but that it would by no means be proper for one doctor to\ntell another to leave the house. And so Mr Rerechild was allowed to\nshare the glories of the night.\n\nIn the meantime the patient remained speechless; but it soon became\nevident that Nature was using all her efforts to make one final\nrally. From time to time he moaned and muttered as though he was\nconscious, and it seemed as though he strove to speak. He gradually\nbecame awake, at any rate to suffering, and Dr Thorne began to think\nthat the last scene would be postponed for yet a while longer.\n\n\"Wonderful strong constitution--eh, Dr Thorne? wonderful!\" said Mr\nRerechild.\n\n\"Yes; he has been a strong man.\"\n\n\"Strong as a horse, Dr Thorne. Lord, what that man would have been if\nhe had given himself a chance! You know his constitution of course.\"\n\n\"Yes; pretty well. I've attended him for many years.\"\n\n\"Always drinking, I suppose; always at it--eh?\"\n\n\"He has not been a temperate man, certainly.\"\n\n\"The brain, you see, clean gone--and not a particle of coating left\nto the stomach; and yet what a struggle he makes--an interesting\ncase, isn't it?\"\n\n\"It's very sad to see such an intellect so destroyed.\"\n\n\"Very sad, very sad indeed. How Fillgrave would have liked to have\nseen this case. He is a clever man, is Fillgrave--in his way, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"I'm sure he is,\" said Dr Thorne.\n\n\"Not that he'd make anything of a case like this now--he's not, you\nknow, quite--quite--perhaps not quite up to the new time of day, if\none may say so.\"\n\n\"He has had a very extensive provincial practice,\" said Dr Thorne.\n\n\"Oh, very--very; and made a tidy lot of money too, has Fillgrave.\nHe's worth six thousand pounds, I suppose; now that's a good deal of\nmoney to put by in a little town like Barchester.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed.\"\n\n\"What I say to Fillgrave is this--keep your eyes open; one should\nnever be too old to learn--there's always something new worth picking\nup. But, no--he won't believe that. He can't believe that any new\nideas can be worth anything. You know a man must go to the wall in\nthat way--eh, doctor?\"\n\nAnd then again they were called to their patient. \"He's doing finely,\nfinely,\" said Mr Rerechild to Lady Scatcherd. \"There's fair ground to\nhope he'll rally; fair ground, is there not, doctor?\"\n\n\"Yes; he'll rally; but how long that may last, that we can hardly\nsay.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, certainly not, certainly not--that is not with any\ncertainty; but still he's doing finely, Lady Scatcherd, considering\neverything.\"\n\n\"How long will you give him, doctor?\" said Mr Rerechild to his new\nfriend, when they were again alone. \"Ten days? I dare say ten days,\nor from that to a fortnight, not more; but I think he'll struggle on\nten days.\"\n\n\"Perhaps so,\" said the doctor. \"I should not like to say exactly to\na day.\"\n\n\"No, certainly not. We cannot say exactly to a day; but I say ten\ndays; as for anything like a recovery, that you know--\"\n\n\"Is out of the question,\" said Dr Thorne, gravely.\n\n\"Quite so; quite so; coating of the stomach clean gone, you know;\nbrain destroyed: did you observe the periporollida? I never saw\nthem so swelled before: now when the periporollida are swollen like\nthat--\"\n\n\"Yes, very much; it's always the case when paralysis has been brought\nabout by intemperance.\"\n\n\"Always, always; I have remarked that always; the periporollida in\nsuch cases are always extended; most interesting case, isn't it? I do\nwish Fillgrave could have seen it. But, I believe you and Fillgrave\ndon't quite--eh?\"\n\n\"No, not quite,\" said Dr Thorne; who, as he thought of his last\ninterview with Dr Fillgrave, and of that gentleman's exceeding anger\nas he stood in the hall below, could not keep himself from smiling,\nsad as the occasion was.\n\nNothing would induce Lady Scatcherd to go to bed; but the two doctors\nagreed to lie down, each in a room on one side of the patient. How\nwas it possible that anything but good should come to him, being so\nguarded? \"He is going on finely, Lady Scatcherd, quite finely,\" were\nthe last words Mr Rerechild said as he left the room.\n\nAnd then Dr Thorne, taking Lady Scatcherd's hand and leading her out\ninto another chamber, told her the truth.\n\n\"Lady Scatcherd,\" said he, in his tenderest voice--and his voice\ncould be very tender when occasion required it--\"Lady Scatcherd, do\nnot hope; you must not hope; it would be cruel to bid you do so.\"\n\n\"Oh, doctor! oh, doctor!\"\n\n\"My dear friend, there is no hope.\"\n\n\"Oh, Dr Thorne!\" said the wife, looking wildly up into her\ncompanion's face, though she hardly yet realised the meaning of what\nhe said, although her senses were half stunned by the blow.\n\n\"Dear Lady Scatcherd, is it not better that I should tell you the\ntruth?\"\n\n\"Oh, I suppose so; oh yes, oh yes; ah me! ah me! ah me!\" And then she\nbegan rocking herself backwards and forwards on her chair, with her\napron up to her eyes. \"What shall I do? what shall I do?\"\n\n\"Look to Him, Lady Scatcherd, who only can make such grief\nendurable.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, yes; I suppose so. Ah me! ah me! But, Dr Thorne, there\nmust be some chance--isn't there any chance? That man says he's going\non so well.\"\n\n\"I fear there is no chance--as far as my knowledge goes there is no\nchance.\"\n\n\"Then why does that chattering magpie tell such lies to a woman? Ah\nme! ah me! ah me! oh, doctor! doctor! what shall I do? what shall I\ndo?\" and poor Lady Scatcherd, fairly overcome by her sorrow, burst\nout crying like a great school-girl.\n\nAnd yet what had her husband done for her that she should thus weep\nfor him? Would not her life be much more blessed when this cause of\nall her troubles should be removed from her? Would she not then be a\nfree woman instead of a slave? Might she not then expect to begin to\ntaste the comforts of life? What had that harsh tyrant of hers done\nthat was good or serviceable for her? Why should she thus weep for\nhim in paroxysms of truest grief?\n\nWe hear a good deal of jolly widows; and the slanderous raillery of\nthe world tells much of conjugal disturbances as a cure for which\nwomen will look forward to a state of widowhood with not unwilling\neyes. The raillery of the world is very slanderous. In our daily\njests we attribute to each other vices of which neither we, nor our\nneighbours, nor our friends, nor even our enemies are ever guilty.\nIt is our favourite parlance to talk of the family troubles of Mrs\nGreen on our right, and to tell how Mrs Young on our left is strongly\nsuspected of having raised her hand to her lord and master. What\nright have we to make these charges? What have we seen in our own\npersonal walks through life to make us believe that women are devils?\nThere may possibly have been a Xantippe here and there, but Imogenes\nare to be found under every bush. Lady Scatcherd, in spite of the\nlife she had led, was one of them.\n\n\"You should send a message up to London for Louis,\" said the doctor.\n\n\"We did that, doctor; we did that to-day--we sent up a telegraph. Oh\nme! oh me! poor boy, what will he do? I shall never know what to do\nwith him, never! never!\" And with such sorrowful wailings she sat\nrocking herself through the long night, every now and then comforting\nherself by the performance of some menial service in the sick man's\nroom.\n\nSir Roger passed the night much as he had passed the day, except\nthat he appeared gradually to be growing nearer to a state of\nconsciousness. On the following morning they succeeded at last in\nmaking Mr Rerechild understand that they were not desirous of keeping\nhim longer from his Barchester practice; and at about twelve o'clock\nDr Thorne also went, promising that he would return in the evening,\nand again pass the night at Boxall Hill.\n\nIn the course of the afternoon Sir Roger once more awoke to his\nsenses, and when he did so his son was standing at his bedside. Louis\nPhilippe Scatcherd--or as it may be more convenient to call him,\nLouis--was a young man just of the age of Frank Gresham. But there\ncould hardly be two youths more different in their appearance. Louis,\nthough his father and mother were both robust persons, was short and\nslight, and now of a sickly frame. Frank was a picture of health\nand strength; but, though manly in disposition, was by no means\nprecocious either in appearance or manners. Louis Scatcherd looked\nas though he was four years the other's senior. He had been sent to\nEton when he was fifteen, his father being under the impression that\nthis was the most ready and best-recognised method of making him a\ngentleman. Here he did not altogether fail as regarded the coveted\nobject of his becoming the companion of gentlemen. He had more\npocket-money than any other lad in the school, and was possessed also\nof a certain effrontery which carried him ahead among boys of his own\nage. He gained, therefore, a degree of \u00c3\u00a9clat, even among those who\nknew, and very frequently said to each other, that young Scatcherd\nwas not fit to be their companion except on such open occasions as\nthose of cricket-matches and boat-races. Boys, in this respect, are\nat least as exclusive as men, and understand as well the difference\nbetween an inner and an outer circle. Scatcherd had many companions\nat school who were glad enough to go up to Maidenhead with him in his\nboat; but there was not one among them who would have talked to him\nof his sister.\n\nSir Roger was vastly proud of his son's success, and did his best\nto stimulate it by lavish expenditure at the Christopher, whenever\nhe could manage to run down to Eton. But this practice, though\nsufficiently unexceptionable to the boys, was not held in equal\ndelight by the masters. To tell the truth, neither Sir Roger nor his\nson were favourites with these stern custodians. At last it was felt\nnecessary to get rid of them both; and Louis was not long in giving\nthem an opportunity, by getting tipsy twice in one week. On the\nsecond occasion he was sent away, and he and Sir Roger, though long\ntalked of, were seen no more at Eton.\n\nBut the universities were still open to Louis Philippe, and before he\nwas eighteen he was entered as a gentleman-commoner at Trinity. As he\nwas, moreover, the eldest son of a baronet, and had almost unlimited\ncommand of money, here also he was enabled for a while to shine.\n\nTo shine! but very fitfully; and one may say almost with a ghastly\nglare. The very lads who had eaten his father's dinners at Eton, and\nshared his four-oar at Eton, knew much better than to associate with\nhim at Cambridge now that they had put on the _toga virilis_. They\nwere still as prone as ever to fun, frolic, and devilry--perhaps more\nso than ever, seeing that more was in their power; but they acquired\nan idea that it behoved them to be somewhat circumspect as to the men\nwith whom their pranks were perpetrated. So, in those days, Louis\nScatcherd was coldly looked on by his whilom Eton friends.\n\nBut young Scatcherd did not fail to find companions at Cambridge\nalso. There are few places indeed in which a rich man cannot buy\ncompanionship. But the set with whom he lived at Cambridge were the\nworst of the place. They were fast, slang men, who were fast and\nslang, and nothing else--men who imitated grooms in more than their\ndress, and who looked on the customary heroes of race-courses as the\nhighest lords of the ascendant upon earth. Among those at college\nyoung Scatcherd did shine as long as such lustre was permitted him.\nHere, indeed, his father, who had striven only to encourage him at\nEton, did strive somewhat to control him. But that was not now easy.\nIf he limited his son's allowance, he only drove him to do his\ndebauchery on credit. There were plenty to lend money to the son of\nthe great millionaire; and so, after eighteen months' trial of a\nuniversity education, Sir Roger had no alternative but to withdraw\nhis son from his _alma mater_.\n\nWhat was he then to do with him? Unluckily it was considered quite\nunnecessary to take any steps towards enabling him to earn his\nbread. Now nothing on earth can be more difficult than bringing up\nwell a young man who has not to earn his own bread, and who has no\nrecognised station among other men similarly circumstanced. Juvenile\ndukes, and sprouting earls, find their duties and their places as\neasily as embryo clergymen and sucking barristers. Provision is\nmade for their peculiar positions: and, though they may possibly go\nastray, they have a fair chance given to them of running within the\nposts. The same may be said of such youths as Frank Gresham. There\nare enough of them in the community to have made it necessary that\ntheir well-being should be a matter of care and forethought. But\nthere are but few men turned out in the world in the position of\nLouis Scatcherd; and, of those few, but very few enter the real\nbattle of life under good auspices.\n\nPoor Sir Roger, though he had hardly time with all his multitudinous\nrailways to look into this thoroughly, had a glimmering of it. When\nhe saw his son's pale face, and paid his wine bills, and heard of his\ndoings in horse-flesh, he did know that things were not going well;\nhe did understand that the heir to a baronetcy and a fortune of some\nten thousand a year might be doing better. But what was he to do? He\ncould not watch over his boy himself; so he took a tutor for him and\nsent him abroad.\n\nLouis and the tutor got as far as Berlin, with what mutual\nsatisfaction to each other need not be specially described. But from\nBerlin Sir Roger received a letter in which the tutor declined to go\nany further in the task which he had undertaken. He found that he\nhad no influence over his pupil, and he could not reconcile it to\nhis conscience to be the spectator of such a life as that which Mr\nScatcherd led. He had no power in inducing Mr Scatcherd to leave\nBerlin; but he would remain there himself till he should hear from\nSir Roger. So Sir Roger had to leave the huge Government works which\nhe was then erecting on the southern coast, and hurry off to Berlin\nto see what could be done with young Hopeful.\n\nThe young Hopeful was by no means a fool; and in some matters was\nmore than a match for his father. Sir Roger, in his anger, threatened\nto cast him off without a shilling. Louis, with mixed penitence and\neffrontery, reminded him that he could not change the descent of the\ntitle; promised amendment; declared that he had done only as do other\nyoung men of fortune; and hinted that the tutor was a strait-laced\nass. The father and the son returned together to Boxall Hill, and\nthree months afterwards Mr Scatcherd set up for himself in London.\n\nAnd now his life, if not more virtuous, was more crafty than it had\nbeen. He had no tutor to watch his doings and complain of them, and\nhe had sufficient sense to keep himself from absolute pecuniary ruin.\nHe lived, it is true, where sharpers and blacklegs had too often\nopportunities of plucking him; but, young as he was, he had been\nsufficiently long about the world to take care he was not openly\nrobbed; and as he was not openly robbed, his father, in a certain\nsense, was proud of him.\n\nTidings, however, came--came at least in those last days--which cut\nSir Roger to the quick; tidings of vice in the son which the father\ncould not but attribute to his own example. Twice the mother was\ncalled up to the sick-bed of her only child, while he lay raving in\nthat horrid madness by which the outraged mind avenges itself on the\nbody! Twice he was found raging in delirium tremens, and twice the\nfather was told that a continuance of such life must end in an early\ndeath.\n\nIt may easily be conceived that Sir Roger was not a happy man. Lying\nthere with that brandy bottle beneath his pillow, reflecting in his\nmoments of rest that that son of his had his brandy bottle beneath\nhis pillow, he could hardly have been happy. But he was not a man to\nsay much about his misery. Though he could restrain neither himself\nnor his heir, he could endure in silence; and in silence he did\nendure, till, opening his eyes to the consciousness of death, he at\nlast spoke a few words to the only friend he knew.\n\nLouis Scatcherd was not a fool, nor was he naturally, perhaps, of a\ndepraved disposition; but he had to reap the fruits of the worst\neducation which England was able to give him. There were moments in\nhis life when he felt that a better, a higher, nay, a much happier\ncareer was open to him than that which he had prepared himself to\nlead. Now and then he would reflect what money and rank might have\ndone for him; he would look with wishful eyes to the proud doings of\nothers of his age; would dream of quiet joys, of a sweet wife, of a\nhouse to which might be asked friends who were neither jockeys nor\ndrunkards; he would dream of such things in his short intervals of\nconstrained sobriety; but the dream would only serve to make him\nmoody.\n\nThis was the best side of his character; the worst, probably, was\nthat which was brought into play by the fact that he was not a fool.\nHe would have a better chance of redemption in this world--perhaps\nalso in another--had he been a fool. As it was, he was no fool: he\nwas not to be done, not he; he knew, no one better, the value of\na shilling; he knew, also, how to keep his shillings, and how to\nspend them. He consorted much with blacklegs and such-like, because\nblacklegs were to his taste. But he boasted daily, nay, hourly to\nhimself, and frequently to those around him, that the leeches who\nwere stuck round him could draw but little blood from him. He could\nspend his money freely; but he would so spend it that he himself\nmight reap the gratification of the expenditure. He was acute,\ncrafty, knowing, and up to every damnable dodge practised by men of\nthe class with whom he lived. At one-and-twenty he was that most\nodious of all odious characters--a close-fisted reprobate.\n\nHe was a small man, not ill-made by Nature, but reduced to unnatural\ntenuity by dissipation--a corporeal attribute of which he was apt\nto boast, as it enabled him, as he said, to put himself up at 7 st.\n7 lb. without any \"d---- nonsense of not eating and drinking.\" The\npower, however, was one of which he did not often avail himself, as\nhis nerves were seldom in a fit state for riding. His hair was dark\nred, and he wore red moustaches, and a great deal of red beard\nbeneath his chin, cut in a manner to make him look like an American.\nHis voice also had a Yankee twang, being a cross between that of an\nAmerican trader and an English groom; and his eyes were keen and\nfixed, and cold and knowing.\n\nSuch was the son whom Sir Roger saw standing at his bedside when\nfirst he awoke to consciousness. It must not be supposed that Sir\nRoger looked at him with our eyes. To him he was an only child,\nthe heir of his wealth, the future bearer of his title; the most\nheart-stirring remembrancer of those other days, when he had been\nso much a poorer, and so much a happier man. Let that boy be bad\nor good, he was all Sir Roger had; and the father was still able\nto hope, when others thought that all ground for hope was gone.\n\nThe mother also loved her son with a mother's natural love; but Louis\nhad ever been ashamed of his mother, and had, as far as possible,\nestranged himself from her. Her heart, perhaps, fixed itself\nwith almost a warmer love on Frank Gresham, her foster-son. Frank\nshe saw but seldom, but when she did see him he never refused her\nembrace. There was, too, a joyous, genial lustre about Frank's face\nwhich always endeared him to women, and made his former nurse regard\nhim as the pet creation of the age. Though she but seldom interfered\nwith any monetary arrangement of her husband's, yet once or twice she\nhad ventured to hint that a legacy left to the young squire would\nmake her a happy woman. Sir Roger, however, on these occasions had\nnot appeared very desirous of making his wife happy.\n\n\"Ah, Louis! is that you?\" ejaculated Sir Roger, in tones hardly more\nthan half-formed: afterwards, in a day or two that is, he fully\nrecovered his voice; but just then he could hardly open his jaws, and\nspoke almost through his teeth. He managed, however, to put out his\nhand and lay it on the counterpane, so that his son could take it.\n\n\"Why, that's well, governor,\" said the son; \"you'll be as right as a\ntrivet in a day or two--eh, governor?\"\n\nThe \"governor\" smiled with a ghastly smile. He already pretty well\nknew that he would never again be \"right,\" as his son called it, on\nthat side of the grave. It did not, moreover, suit him to say much\njust at that moment, so he contented himself with holding his son's\nhand. He lay still in this position for a moment, and then, turning\nround painfully on his side, endeavoured to put his hand to the place\nwhere his dire enemy usually was concealed. Sir Roger, however, was\ntoo weak now to be his own master; he was at length, though too late,\na captive in the hands of nurses and doctors, and the bottle had now\nbeen removed.\n\nThen Lady Scatcherd came in, and seeing that her husband was no\nlonger unconscious, she could not but believe that Dr Thorne had been\nwrong; she could not but think that there must be some ground for\nhope. She threw herself on her knees at the bedside, bursting into\ntears as she did so, and taking Sir Roger's hand in hers covered it\nwith kisses.\n\n\"Bother!\" said Sir Roger.\n\nShe did not, however, long occupy herself with the indulgence of her\nfeelings; but going speedily to work, produced such sustenance as\nthe doctors had ordered to be given when the patient might awake. A\nbreakfast-cup was brought to him, and a few drops were put into his\nmouth; but he soon made it manifest that he would take nothing more\nof a description so perfectly innocent.\n\n\"A drop of brandy--just a little drop,\" said he, half-ordering, and\nhalf-entreating.\n\n\"Ah, Roger!\" said Lady Scatcherd.\n\n\"Just a little drop, Louis,\" said the sick man, appealing to his son.\n\n\"A little will be good for him; bring the bottle, mother,\" said the\nson.\n\nAfter some altercation the brandy bottle was brought, and Louis, with\nwhat he thought a very sparing hand, proceeded to pour about half a\nwine-glassful into the cup. As he did so, Sir Roger, weak as he was,\ncontrived to shake his son's arm, so as greatly to increase the dose.\n\n\"Ha! ha! ha!\" laughed the sick man, and then greedily swallowed the\ndose.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nSir Roger Dies\n\n\nThat night the doctor stayed at Boxall Hill, and the next night;\nso that it became a customary thing for him to sleep there during\nthe latter part of Sir Roger's illness. He returned home daily to\nGreshamsbury; for he had his patients there, to whom he was as\nnecessary as to Sir Roger, the foremost of whom was Lady Arabella. He\nhad, therefore, no slight work on his hands, seeing that his nights\nwere by no means wholly devoted to rest.\n\nMr Rerechild had not been much wrong as to the remaining space of\nlife which he had allotted to the dying man. Once or twice Dr Thorne\nhad thought that the great original strength of his patient would\nhave enabled him to fight against death for a somewhat longer period;\nbut Sir Roger would give himself no chance. Whenever he was strong\nenough to have a will of his own, he insisted on having his very\nmedicine mixed with brandy; and in the hours of the doctor's absence,\nhe was too often successful in his attempts.\n\n\"It does not much matter,\" Dr Thorne had said to Lady Scatcherd. \"Do\nwhat you can to keep down the quantity, but do not irritate him by\nrefusing to obey. It does not much signify now.\" So Lady Scatcherd\nstill administered the alcohol, and he from day to day invented\nlittle schemes for increasing the amount, over which he chuckled with\nghastly laughter.\n\nTwo or three times during these days Sir Roger essayed to speak\nseriously to his son; but Louis always frustrated him. He either got\nout of the room on some excuse, or made his mother interfere on the\nscore that so much talking would be bad for his father. He already\nknew with tolerable accuracy what was the purport of his father's\nwill, and by no means approved of it; but as he could not now hope\nto induce his father to alter it so as to make it more favourable to\nhimself, he conceived that no conversation on matters of business\ncould be of use to him.\n\n\"Louis,\" said Sir Roger, one afternoon to his son; \"Louis, I have not\ndone by you as I ought to have done--I know that now.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, governor; never mind about that now; I shall do well\nenough, I dare say. Besides, it isn't too late; you can make it\ntwenty-three years instead of twenty-five, if you like it.\"\n\n\"I do not mean as to money, Louis. There are things besides money\nwhich a father ought to look to.\"\n\n\"Now, father, don't fret yourself--I'm all right; you may be sure of\nthat.\"\n\n\"Louis, it's that accursed brandy--it's that that I'm afraid of: you\nsee me here, my boy, how I'm lying here now.\"\n\n\"Don't you be annoying yourself, governor; I'm all right--quite\nright; and as for you, why, you'll be up and about yourself in\nanother month or so.\"\n\n\"I shall never be off this bed, my boy, till I'm carried into my\ncoffin, on those chairs there. But I'm not thinking of myself, Louis,\nbut you; think what you may have before you if you can't avoid that\naccursed bottle.\"\n\n\"I'm all right, governor; right as a trivet. It's very little I take,\nexcept at an odd time or so.\"\n\n\"Oh, Louis! Louis!\"\n\n\"Come, father, cheer up; this sort of thing isn't the thing for you\nat all. I wonder where mother is: she ought to be here with the\nbroth; just let me go, and I'll see for her.\"\n\nThe father understood it all. He saw that it was now much beyond his\nfaded powers to touch the heart or conscience of such a youth as his\nson had become. What now could he do for his boy except die? What\nelse, what other benefit, did his son require of him but to die; to\ndie so that his means of dissipation might be unbounded? He let go\nthe unresisting hand which he held, and, as the young man crept out\nof the room, he turned his face to the wall. He turned his face to\nthe wall and held bitter commune with his own heart. To what had he\nbrought himself? To what had he brought his son? Oh, how happy would\nit have been for him could he have remained all his days a working\nstone-mason in Barchester! How happy could he have died as such,\nyears ago! Such tears as those which wet that pillow are the\nbitterest which human eyes can shed.\n\nBut while they were dropping, the memoir of his life was in quick\ncourse of preparation. It was, indeed, nearly completed, with\nconsiderable detail. He had lingered on four days longer than might\nhave been expected, and the author had thus had more than usual time\nfor the work. In these days a man is nobody unless his biography\nis kept so far posted up that it may be ready for the national\nbreakfast-table on the morning after his demise. When it chances that\nthe dead hero is one who was taken in his prime of life, of whose\ndeparture from among us the most far-seeing biographical scribe can\nhave no prophetic inkling, this must be difficult. Of great men, full\nof years, who are ripe for the sickle, who in the course of Nature\nmust soon fall, it is of course comparatively easy for an active\ncompiler to have his complete memoir ready in his desk. But in order\nthat the idea of omnipresent and omniscient information may be kept\nup, the young must be chronicled as quickly as the old. In some cases\nthis task must, one would say, be difficult. Nevertheless, it is\ndone.\n\nThe memoir of Sir Roger Scatcherd was progressing favourably. In\nthis it was told how fortunate had been his life; how, in his case,\nindustry and genius combined had triumphed over the difficulties\nwhich humble birth and deficient education had thrown in his way;\nhow he had made a name among England's great men; how the Queen had\ndelighted to honour him, and nobles had been proud to have him for a\nguest at their mansions. Then followed a list of all the great works\nwhich he had achieved, of the railroads, canals, docks, harbours,\njails, and hospitals which he had constructed. His name was held up\nas an example to the labouring classes of his countrymen, and he was\npointed at as one who had lived and died happy--ever happy, said the\nbiographer, because ever industrious. And so a great moral question\nwas inculcated. A short paragraph was devoted to his appearance in\nParliament; and unfortunate Mr Romer was again held up for disgrace,\nfor the thirtieth time, as having been the means of depriving\nour legislative councils of the great assistance of Sir Roger's\nexperience.\n\n\"Sir Roger,\" said the biographer in his concluding passage, \"was\npossessed of an iron frame; but even iron will yield to the repeated\nblows of the hammer. In the latter years of his life he was known to\novertask himself; and at length the body gave way, though the mind\nremained firm to the _last_. The subject of this memoir was only\nfifty-nine when he was taken from us.\"\n\nAnd thus Sir Roger's life was written, while the tears were\nyet falling on his pillow at Boxall Hill. It was a pity that a\nproof-sheet could not have been sent to him. No man was vainer of\nhis reputation, and it would have greatly gratified him to know that\nposterity was about to speak of him in such terms--to speak of him\nwith a voice that would be audible for twenty-four hours.\n\nSir Roger made no further attempt to give counsel to his son. It was\ntoo evidently useless. The old dying lion felt that the lion's power\nhad already passed from him, and that he was helpless in the hands\nof the young cub who was so soon to inherit the wealth of the forest.\nBut Dr Thorne was more kind to him. He had something yet to say as to\nhis worldly hopes and worldly cares; and his old friend did not turn\na deaf ear to him.\n\nIt was during the night that Sir Roger was most anxious to talk, and\nmost capable of talking. He would lie through the day in a state\nhalf-comatose; but towards evening he would rouse himself, and by\nmidnight he would be full of fitful energy. One night, as he lay\nwakeful and full of thought, he thus poured forth his whole heart to\nDr Thorne.\n\n\"Thorne,\" said he, \"I told you about my will, you know.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the other; \"and I have blamed myself greatly that I have\nnot again urged you to alter it. Your illness came too suddenly,\nScatcherd; and then I was averse to speak of it.\"\n\n\"Why should I alter it? It is a good will; as good as I can make. Not\nbut that I have altered it since I spoke to you. I did it that day\nafter you left me.\"\n\n\"Have you definitely named your heir in default of Louis?\"\n\n\"No--that is--yes--I had done that before; I have said Mary's eldest\nchild: I have not altered that.\"\n\n\"But, Scatcherd, you must alter it.\"\n\n\"Must! well then I won't; but I'll tell you what I have done. I have\nadded a postscript--a codicil they call it--saying that you, and you\nonly, know who is her eldest child. Winterbones and Jack Martin have\nwitnessed that.\"\n\nDr Thorne was going to explain how very injudicious such an\narrangement appeared to be; but Sir Roger would not listen to him.\nIt was not about that that he wished to speak to him. To him it was\nmatter of but minor interest who might inherit his money if his son\nshould die early; his care was solely for his son's welfare. At\ntwenty-five the heir might make his own will--might bequeath all this\nwealth according to his own fancy. Sir Roger would not bring himself\nto believe that his son could follow him to the grave in so short a\ntime.\n\n\"Never mind that, doctor, now; but about Louis; you will be his\nguardian, you know.\"\n\n\"Not his guardian. He is more than of age.\"\n\n\"Ah! but doctor, you will be his guardian. The property will not be\nhis till he be twenty-five. You will not desert him?\"\n\n\"I will not desert him; but I doubt whether I can do much for\nhim--what can I do, Scatcherd?\"\n\n\"Use the power that a strong man has over a weak one. Use the power\nthat my will will give you. Do for him as you would for a son of your\nown if you saw him going in bad courses. Do as a friend should do for\na friend that is dead and gone. I would do so for you, doctor, if our\nplaces were changed.\"\n\n\"What I can do, that I will do,\" said Thorne, solemnly, taking as he\nspoke the contractor's hand in his own with a tight grasp.\n\n\"I know you will; I know you will. Oh! doctor, may you never feel as\nI do now! May you on your death-bed have no dread as I have, as to\nthe fate of those you will leave behind you!\"\n\nDoctor Thorne felt that he could not say much in answer to this. The\nfuture fate of Louis Scatcherd was, he could not but own to himself,\ngreatly to be dreaded. What good, what happiness, could be presaged\nfor such a one as he was? What comfort could he offer to the father?\nAnd then he was called on to compare, as it were, the prospects of\nthis unfortunate with those of his own darling; to contrast all that\nwas murky, foul, and disheartening, with all that was perfect--for to\nhim she was all but perfect; to liken Louis Scatcherd to the angel\nwho brightened his own hearthstone. How could he answer to such an\nappeal?\n\nHe said nothing; but merely tightened his grasp of the other's hand,\nto signify that he would do, as best he could, all that was asked\nof him. Sir Roger looked up sadly into the doctor's face, as though\nexpecting some word of consolation. There was no comfort, no\nconsolation to come to him!\n\n\"For three or four years he must greatly depend upon you,\" continued\nSir Roger.\n\n\"I will do what I can,\" said the doctor. \"What I can do I will do.\nBut he is not a child, Scatcherd: at his age he must stand or fall\nmainly by his own conduct. The best thing for him will be to marry.\"\n\n\"Exactly; that's just it, Thorne: I was coming to that. If he would\nmarry, I think he would do well yet, for all that has come and gone.\nIf he married, of course you would let him have the command of his\nown income.\"\n\n\"I will be governed entirely by your wishes: under any circumstances\nhis income will, as I understand, be quite sufficient for him,\nmarried or single.\"\n\n\"Ah!--but, Thorne, I should like to think he should shine with the\nbest of them. For what have I made the money if not for that? Now if\nhe marries--decently, that is--some woman you know that can assist\nhim in the world, let him have what he wants. It is not to save the\nmoney that I put it into your hands.\"\n\n\"No, Scatcherd; not to save the money, but to save him. I think that\nwhile you are yet with him you should advise him to marry.\"\n\n\"He does not care a straw for what I advise, not one straw. Why\nshould he? How can I tell him to be sober when I have been a beast\nall my life myself? How can I advise him? That's where it is! It is\nthat that now kills me. Advise! Why, when I speak to him he treats me\nlike a child.\"\n\n\"He fears that you are too weak, you know: he thinks that you should\nnot be allowed to talk.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! he knows better; you know better. Too weak! what\nsignifies? Would I not give all that I have of strength at one blow\nif I could open his eyes to see as I see but for one minute?\" And\nthe sick man raised himself up in his bed as though he were actually\ngoing to expend all that remained to him of vigour in the energy of a\nmoment.\n\n\"Gently, Scatcherd; gently. He will listen to you yet; but do not be\nso unruly.\"\n\n\"Thorne, you see that bottle there? Give me half a glass of brandy.\"\n\nThe doctor turned round in his chair; but he hesitated in doing as he\nwas desired.\n\n\"Do as I ask you, doctor. It can do no harm now; you know that well\nenough. Why torture me now?\"\n\n\"No, I will not torture you; but you will have water with it?\"\n\n\"Water! No; the brandy by itself. I tell you I cannot speak without\nit. What's the use of canting now? You know it can make no\ndifference.\"\n\nSir Roger was right. It could make no difference; and Dr Thorne gave\nhim the half glass of brandy.\n\n\"Ah, well; you've a stingy hand, doctor; confounded stingy. You don't\nmeasure your medicines out in such light doses.\"\n\n\"You will be wanting more before morning, you know.\"\n\n\"Before morning! indeed I shall; a pint or so before that. I remember\nthe time, doctor, when I have drunk to my own cheek above two quarts\nbetween dinner and breakfast! aye, and worked all the day after it!\"\n\n\"You have been a wonderful man, Scatcherd, very wonderful.\"\n\n\"Aye, wonderful! well, never mind. It's over now. But what was I\nsaying?--about Louis, doctor; you'll not desert him?\"\n\n\"Certainly not.\"\n\n\"He's not strong; I know that. How should he be strong, living as he\nhas done? Not that it seemed to hurt me when I was his age.\"\n\n\"You had the advantage of hard work.\"\n\n\"That's it. Sometimes I wish that Louis had not a shilling in the\nworld; that he had to trudge about with an apron round his waist as I\ndid. But it's too late now to think of that. If he would only marry,\ndoctor.\"\n\nDr Thorne again expressed an opinion that no step would be so likely\nto reform the habits of the young heir as marriage; and repeated his\nadvice to the father to implore his son to take a wife.\n\n\"I'll tell you what, Thorne,\" said he. And then, after a pause, he\nwent on. \"I have not half told you as yet what is on my mind; and I'm\nnearly afraid to tell it; though, indeed, I don't know why I should\nbe.\"\n\n\"I never knew you afraid of anything yet,\" said the doctor, smiling\ngently.\n\n\"Well, then, I'll not end by turning coward. Now, doctor, tell the\ntruth to me; what do you expect me to do for that girl of yours that\nwe were talking of--Mary's child?\"\n\nThere was a pause for a moment, for Thorne was slow to answer him.\n\n\"You would not let me see her, you know, though she is my niece as\ntruly as she is yours.\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" at last said the doctor, slowly. \"I expect nothing. I\nwould not let you see her, and therefore, I expect nothing.\"\n\n\"She will have it all if poor Louis should die,\" said Sir Roger.\n\n\"If you intend it so you should put her name into the will,\" said the\nother. \"Not that I ask you or wish you to do so. Mary, thank God, can\ndo without wealth.\"\n\n\"Thorne, on one condition I will put her name into it. I will alter\nit all on one condition. Let the two cousins be man and wife--let\nLouis marry poor Mary's child.\"\n\nThe proposition for a moment took away the doctor's breath, and he\nwas unable to answer. Not for all the wealth of India would he have\ngiven up his lamb to that young wolf, even though he had had the\npower to do so. But that lamb--lamb though she was--had, as he well\nknew, a will of her own on such a matter. What alliance could be more\nimpossible, thought he to himself, than one between Mary Thorne and\nLouis Scatcherd?\n\n\"I will alter it all if you will give me your hand upon it that you\nwill do your best to bring about this marriage. Everything shall be\nhis on the day he marries her; and should he die unmarried, it shall\nall then be hers by name. Say the word, Thorne, and she shall come\nhere at once. I shall yet have time to see her.\"\n\nBut Dr Thorne did not say the word; just at the moment he said\nnothing, but he slowly shook his head.\n\n\"Why not, Thorne?\"\n\n\"My friend, it is impossible.\"\n\n\"Why impossible?\"\n\n\"Her hand is not mine to dispose of, nor is her heart.\"\n\n\"Then let her come over herself.\"\n\n\"What! Scatcherd, that the son might make love to her while the\nfather is so dangerously ill! Bid her come to look for a rich\nhusband! That would not be seemly, would it?\"\n\n\"No; not for that: let her come merely that I may see her; that we\nmay all know her. I will leave the matter then in your hands if you\nwill promise me to do your best.\"\n\n\"But, my friend, in this matter I cannot do my best. I can do\nnothing. And, indeed, I may say at once, that it is altogether out of\nthe question. I know--\"\n\n\"What do you know?\" said the baronet, turning on him almost angrily.\n\"What can you know to make you say that it is impossible? Is she a\npearl of such price that a man may not win her?\"\n\n\"She is a pearl of great price.\"\n\n\"Believe me, doctor, money goes far in winning such pearls.\"\n\n\"Perhaps so; I know little about it. But this I do know, that money\nwill not win her. Let us talk of something else; believe me it is\nuseless for us to think of this.\"\n\n\"Yes; if you set your face against it obstinately. You must think\nvery poorly of Louis if you suppose that no girl can fancy him.\"\n\n\"I have not said so, Scatcherd.\"\n\n\"To have the spending of ten thousand a year, and be a baronet's\nlady! Why, doctor, what is it you expect for this girl?\"\n\n\"Not much, indeed; not much. A quiet heart and a quiet home; not much\nmore.\"\n\n\"Thorne, if you will be ruled by me in this, she shall be the most\ntopping woman in this county.\"\n\n\"My friend, my friend, why thus grieve me? Why should you thus harass\nyourself? I tell you it is impossible. They have never seen each\nother; they have nothing, and can have nothing in common; their\ntastes, and wishes, and pursuits are different. Besides, Scatcherd,\nmarriages never answer that are so made; believe me, it is\nimpossible.\"\n\nThe contractor threw himself back on his bed, and lay for some ten\nminutes perfectly quiet; so much so that the doctor began to think\nthat he was sleeping. So thinking, and wearied by the watching,\nDr Thorne was beginning to creep quietly from the room, when his\ncompanion again roused himself, almost with vehemence.\n\n\"You won't do this thing for me, then?\" said he.\n\n\"Do it! It is not for you or me to do such things as that. Such\nthings must be left to those concerned themselves.\"\n\n\"You will not even help me?\"\n\n\"Not in this thing, Sir Roger.\"\n\n\"Then, by ----, she shall not under any circumstances ever have a\nshilling of mine. Give me some of that stuff there,\" and he again\npointed to the brandy bottle which stood ever within his sight.\n\nThe doctor poured out and handed to him another small modicum of\nspirit.\n\n\"Nonsense, man; fill the glass. I'll stand no nonsense now. I'll be\nmaster in my own house to the last. Give it here, I tell you. Ten\nthousand devils are tearing me within. You--you could have comforted\nme; but you would not. Fill the glass I tell you.\"\n\n\"I should be killing you were I to do it.\"\n\n\"Killing me! killing me! you are always talking of killing me. Do you\nsuppose that I am afraid to die? Do not I know how soon it is coming?\nGive me the brandy, I say, or I will be out across the room to fetch\nit.\"\n\n\"No, Scatcherd. I cannot give it to you; not while I am here. Do you\nremember how you were engaged this morning?\"--he had that morning\ntaken the sacrament from the parish clergyman--\"you would not wish to\nmake me guilty of murder, would you?\"\n\n\"Nonsense! You are talking nonsense; habit is second nature. I tell\nyou I shall sink without it. Why, you know I always get it directly\nyour back is turned. Come, I will not be bullied in my own house;\ngive me that bottle, I say!\"--and Sir Roger essayed, vainly enough,\nto raise himself from the bed.\n\n\"Stop, Scatcherd; I will give it you--I will help you. It may be\nthat habit is second nature.\" Sir Roger in his determined energy\nhad swallowed, without thinking of it, the small quantity which the\ndoctor had before poured out for him, and still held the empty glass\nwithin his hand. This the doctor now took and filled nearly to the\nbrim.\n\n\"Come, Thorne, a bumper; a bumper for this once. 'Whatever the drink,\nit a bumper must be.' You stingy fellow! I would not treat you so.\nWell--well.\"\n\n\"It's as full as you can hold it, Scatcherd.\"\n\n\"Try me; try me! my hand is a rock; at least at holding liquor.\" And\nthen he drained the contents of the glass, which were sufficient in\nquantity to have taken away the breath from any ordinary man.\n\n\"Ah, I'm better now. But, Thorne, I do love a full glass, ha! ha!\nha!\"\n\nThere was something frightful, almost sickening, in the peculiar\nhoarse guttural tone of his voice. The sounds came from him as\nthough steeped in brandy, and told, all too plainly, the havoc which\nthe alcohol had made. There was a fire too about his eyes which\ncontrasted with his sunken cheeks: his hanging jaw, unshorn beard,\nand haggard face were terrible to look at. His hands and arms were\nhot and clammy, but so thin and wasted! Of his lower limbs the lost\nuse had not returned to him, so that in all his efforts at vehemence\nhe was controlled by his own want of vitality. When he supported\nhimself, half-sitting against the pillows, he was in a continual\ntremor; and yet, as he boasted, he could still lift his glass\nsteadily to his mouth. Such now was the hero of whom that ready\ncompiler of memoirs had just finished his correct and succinct\naccount.\n\nAfter he had had his brandy, he sat glaring a while at vacancy, as\nthough he was dead to all around him, and was thinking--thinking--\nthinking of things in the infinite distance of the past.\n\n\"Shall I go now,\" said the doctor, \"and send Lady Scatcherd to you?\"\n\n\"Wait a while, doctor; just one minute longer. So you will do nothing\nfor Louis, then?\"\n\n\"I will do everything for him that I can do.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes! everything but the one thing that will save him. Well, I\nwill not ask you again. But remember, Thorne, I shall alter my will\nto-morrow.\"\n\n\"Do so by all means; you may well alter it for the better. If I\nmay advise you, you will have down your own business attorney from\nLondon. If you will let me send he will be here before to-morrow\nnight.\"\n\n\"Thank you for nothing, Thorne: I can manage that matter myself. Now\nleave me; but remember, you have ruined that girl's fortune.\"\n\nThe doctor did leave him, and went not altogether happy to his room.\nHe could not but confess to himself that he had, despite himself as\nit were, fed himself with hope that Mary's future might be made more\nsecure, aye, and brighter too, by some small unheeded fraction broken\noff from the huge mass of her uncle's wealth. Such hope, if it had\namounted to hope, was now all gone. But this was not all, nor was\nthis the worst of it. That he had done right in utterly repudiating\nall idea of a marriage between Mary and her cousin--of that he was\ncertain enough; that no earthly consideration would have induced Mary\nto plight her troth to such a man--that, with him, was as certain as\ndoom. But how far had he done right in keeping her from the sight of\nher uncle? How could he justify it to himself if he had thus robbed\nher of her inheritance, seeing that he had done so from a selfish\nfear lest she, who was now all his own, should be known to the world\nas belonging to others rather than to him? He had taken upon him on\nher behalf to reject wealth as valueless; and yet he had no sooner\ndone so than he began to consume his hours with reflecting how great\nto her would be the value of wealth. And thus, when Sir Roger told\nhim, as he left the room, that he had ruined Mary's fortune, he was\nhardly able to bear the taunt with equanimity.\n\nOn the next morning, after paying his professional visit to his\npatient, and satisfying himself that the end was now drawing near\nwith steps terribly quickened, he went down to Greshamsbury.\n\n\"How long is this to last, uncle?\" said his niece, with sad voice, as\nhe again prepared to return to Boxall Hill.\n\n\"Not long, Mary; do not begrudge him a few more hours of life.\"\n\n\"No, I do not, uncle. I will say nothing more about it. Is his son\nwith him?\" And then, perversely enough, she persisted in asking\nnumerous questions about Louis Scatcherd.\n\n\"Is he likely to marry, uncle?\"\n\n\"I hope so, my dear.\"\n\n\"Will he be so very rich?\"\n\n\"Yes; ultimately he will be very rich.\"\n\n\"He will be a baronet, will he not?\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear.\"\n\n\"What is he like, uncle?\"\n\n\"Like--I never know what a young man is like. He is like a man with\nred hair.\"\n\n\"Uncle, you are the worst hand in describing I ever knew. If I'd seen\nhim for five minutes, I'd be bound to make a portrait of him; and\nyou, if you were describing a dog, you'd only say what colour his\nhair was.\"\n\n\"Well, he's a little man.\"\n\n\"Exactly, just as I should say that Mrs Umbleby had a red-haired\nlittle dog. I wish I had known these Scatcherds, uncle. I do so\nadmire people that can push themselves in the world. I wish I had\nknown Sir Roger.\"\n\n\"You will never know him now, Mary.\"\n\n\"I suppose not. I am so sorry for him. Is Lady Scatcherd nice?\"\n\n\"She is an excellent woman.\"\n\n\"I hope I may know her some day. You are so much there now, uncle; I\nwonder whether you ever mention me to them. If you do, tell her from\nme how much I grieve for her.\"\n\nThat same night Dr Thorne again found himself alone with Sir Roger.\nThe sick man was much more tranquil, and apparently more at ease\nthan he had been on the preceding night. He said nothing about his\nwill, and not a word about Mary Thorne; but the doctor knew that\nWinterbones and a notary's clerk from Barchester had been in the\nbedroom a great part of the day; and, as he knew also that the great\nman of business was accustomed to do his most important work by the\nhands of such tools as these, he did not doubt but that the will\nhad been altered and remodelled. Indeed, he thought it more than\nprobable, that when it was opened it would be found to be wholly\ndifferent in its provisions from that which Sir Roger had already\ndescribed.\n\n\"Louis is clever enough,\" he said, \"sharp enough, I mean. He won't\nsquander the property.\"\n\n\"He has good natural abilities,\" said the doctor.\n\n\"Excellent, excellent,\" said the father. \"He may do well, very well,\nif he can only be kept from this;\" and Sir Roger held up the empty\nwine-glass which stood by his bedside. \"What a life he may have\nbefore him!--and to throw it away for this!\" and as he spoke he took\nthe glass and tossed it across the room. \"Oh, doctor! would that it\nwere all to begin again!\"\n\n\"We all wish that, I dare say, Scatcherd.\"\n\n\"No, you don't wish it. You ain't worth a shilling, and yet you\nregret nothing. I am worth half a million in one way or the other,\nand I regret everything--everything--everything!\"\n\n\"You should not think in that way, Scatcherd; you need not think so.\nYesterday you told Mr Clarke that you were comfortable in your mind.\"\nMr Clarke was the clergyman who had visited him.\n\n\"Of course I did. What else could I say when he asked me? It wouldn't\nhave been civil to have told him that his time and words were\nall thrown away. But, Thorne, believe me, when a man's heart is\nsad--sad--sad to the core, a few words from a parson at the last\nmoment will never make it all right.\"\n\n\"May He have mercy on you, my friend!--if you will think of Him, and\nlook to Him, He will have mercy on you.\"\n\n\"Well--I will try, doctor; but would that it were all to do again.\nYou'll see to the old woman for my sake, won't you?\"\n\n\"What, Lady Scatcherd?\"\n\n\"Lady Devil! If anything angers me now it is that 'ladyship'--her to\nbe my lady! Why, when I came out of jail that time, the poor creature\nhad hardly a shoe to her foot. But it wasn't her fault, Thorne; it\nwas none of her doing. She never asked for such nonsense.\"\n\n\"She has been an excellent wife, Scatcherd; and what is more, she\nis an excellent woman. She is, and ever will be, one of my dearest\nfriends.\"\n\n\"Thank'ee, doctor, thank'ee. Yes; she has been a good wife--better\nfor a poor man than a rich one; but then, that was what she was born\nto. You won't let her be knocked about by them, will you, Thorne?\"\n\nDr Thorne again assured him, that as long as he lived Lady Scatcherd\nshould never want one true friend; in making this promise, however,\nhe managed to drop all allusion to the obnoxious title.\n\n\"You'll be with him as much as possible, won't you?\" again asked the\nbaronet, after lying quite silent for a quarter of an hour.\n\n\"With whom?\" said the doctor, who was then all but asleep.\n\n\"With my poor boy; with Louis.\"\n\n\"If he will let me, I will,\" said the doctor.\n\n\"And, doctor, when you see a glass at his mouth, dash it down; thrust\nit down, though you thrust out the teeth with it. When you see that,\nThorne, tell him of his father--tell him what his father might have\nbeen but for that; tell him how his father died like a beast, because\nhe could not keep himself from drink.\"\n\nThese, reader, were the last words spoken by Sir Roger Scatcherd. As\nhe uttered them he rose up in bed with the same vehemence which he\nhad shown on the former evening. But in the very act of doing so\nhe was again struck by paralysis, and before nine on the following\nmorning all was over.\n\n\"Oh, my man--my own, own man!\" exclaimed the widow, remembering in\nthe paroxysm of her grief nothing but the loves of their early days;\n\"the best, the brightest, the cleverest of them all!\"\n\nSome weeks after this Sir Roger was buried, with much pomp and\nceremony, within the precincts of Barchester Cathedral; and a\nmonument was put up to him soon after, in which he was portrayed as\nsmoothing a block of granite with a mallet and chisel; while his\neagle eye, disdaining such humble work, was fixed upon some intricate\nmathematical instrument above him. Could Sir Roger have seen it\nhimself, he would probably have declared, that no workman was ever\nworth his salt who looked one way while he rowed another.\n\nImmediately after the funeral the will was opened, and Dr Thorne\ndiscovered that the clauses of it were exactly identical with those\nwhich his friend had described to him some months back. Nothing had\nbeen altered; nor had the document been unfolded since that strange\ncodicil was added, in which it was declared that Dr Thorne knew--and\nonly Dr Thorne--who was the eldest child of the testator's only\nsister. At the same time, however, a joint executor with Dr Thorne\nhad been named--one Mr Stock, a man of railway fame--and Dr Thorne\nhimself was made a legatee to the humble extent of a thousand pounds.\nA life income of a thousand pounds a year was left to Lady Scatcherd.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\nWar\n\n\nWe need not follow Sir Roger to his grave, nor partake of the baked\nmeats which were furnished for his funeral banquet. Such men as Sir\nRoger Scatcherd are always well buried, and we have already seen that\nhis glories were duly told to posterity in the graphic diction of his\nsepulchral monument. In a few days the doctor had returned to his\nquiet home, and Sir Louis found himself reigning at Boxall Hill in\nhis father's stead--with, however, a much diminished sway, and, as he\nthought it, but a poor exchequer. We must soon return to him and say\nsomething of his career as a baronet; but for the present, we may go\nback to our more pleasant friends at Greshamsbury.\n\nBut our friends at Greshamsbury had not been making themselves\npleasant--not so pleasant to each other as circumstances would have\nadmitted. In those days which the doctor had felt himself bound to\npass, if not altogether at Boxall Hill, yet altogether away from his\nown home, so as to admit of his being as much as possible with his\npatient, Mary had been thrown more than ever with Patience Oriel,\nand, also, almost more than ever with Beatrice Gresham. As regarded\nMary, she would doubtless have preferred the companionship of\nPatience, though she loved Beatrice far the best; but she had no\nchoice. When she went to the parsonage Beatrice came there also, and\nwhen Patience came to the doctor's house Beatrice either accompanied\nor followed her. Mary could hardly have rejected their society, even\nhad she felt it wise to do so. She would in such case have been all\nalone, and her severance from the Greshamsbury house and household,\nfrom the big family in which she had for so many years been almost at\nhome, would have made such solitude almost unendurable.\n\nAnd then these two girls both knew--not her secret: she had no\nsecret--but the little history of her ill-treatment. They knew that\nthough she had been blameless in this matter, yet she had been the\none to bear the punishment; and, as girls and bosom friends, they\ncould not but sympathise with her, and endow her with heroic\nattributes; make her, in fact, as we are doing, their little heroine\nfor the nonce. This was, perhaps, not serviceable for Mary; but it\nwas far from being disagreeable.\n\nThe tendency to finding matter for hero-worship in Mary's endurance\nwas much stronger with Beatrice than with Miss Oriel. Miss Oriel was\nthe elder, and naturally less afflicted with the sentimentation of\nromance. She had thrown herself into Mary's arms because she had\nseen that it was essentially necessary for Mary's comfort that she\nshould do so. She was anxious to make her friend smile, and to smile\nwith her. Beatrice was quite as true in her sympathy; but she rather\nwished that she and Mary might weep in unison, shed mutual tears, and\nbreak their hearts together.\n\nPatience had spoken of Frank's love as a misfortune, of his conduct\nas erroneous, and to be excused only by his youth, and had never\nappeared to surmise that Mary also might be in love as well as he.\nBut to Beatrice the affair was a tragic difficulty, admitting of no\nsolution; a Gordian knot, not to be cut; a misery now and for ever.\nShe would always talk about Frank when she and Mary were alone; and,\nto speak the truth, Mary did not stop her as she perhaps should have\ndone. As for a marriage between them, that was impossible; Beatrice\nwas well sure of that: it was Frank's unfortunate destiny that he\nmust marry money--money, and, as Beatrice sometimes thoughtlessly\nadded, cutting Mary to the quick,--money and family also. Under such\ncircumstances a marriage between them was quite impossible; but not\nthe less did Beatrice declare, that she would have loved Mary as her\nsister-in-law had it been possible; and how worthy Frank was of a\ngirl's love, had such love been permissible.\n\n\"It is so cruel,\" Beatrice would say; \"so very, very, cruel. You\nwould have suited him in every way.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, Trichy; I should have suited him in no possible way at\nall; nor he me.\"\n\n\"Oh, but you would--exactly. Papa loves you so well.\"\n\n\"And mamma; that would have been so nice.\"\n\n\"Yes; and mamma, too--that is, had you had a fortune,\" said the\ndaughter, na\u00c3\u00afvely. \"She always liked you personally, always.\"\n\n\"Did she?\"\n\n\"Always. And we all love you so.\"\n\n\"Especially Lady Alexandrina.\"\n\n\"That would not have signified, for Frank cannot endure the de\nCourcys himself.\"\n\n\"My dear, it does not matter one straw whom your brother can endure\nor not endure just at present. His character is to be formed, and his\ntastes, and his heart also.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mary!--his heart.\"\n\n\"Yes, his heart; not the fact of his having a heart. I think he has a\nheart; but he himself does not yet understand it.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mary! you do not know him.\"\n\nSuch conversations were not without danger to poor Mary's comfort.\nIt came soon to be the case that she looked rather for this sort\nof sympathy from Beatrice, than for Miss Oriel's pleasant but less\npiquant gaiety.\n\nSo the days of the doctor's absence were passed, and so also the\nfirst week after his return. During this week it was almost daily\nnecessary that the squire should be with him. The doctor was now the\nlegal holder of Sir Roger's property, and, as such, the holder also\nof all the mortgages on Mr Gresham's property; and it was natural\nthat they should be much together. The doctor would not, however,\ngo up to Greshamsbury on any other than medical business; and it\ntherefore became necessary that the squire should be a good deal at\nthe doctor's house.\n\nThen the Lady Arabella became unhappy in her mind. Frank, it was\ntrue, was away at Cambridge, and had been successfully kept out\nof Mary's way since the suspicion of danger had fallen upon Lady\nArabella's mind. Frank was away, and Mary was systematically\nbanished, with due acknowledgement from all the powers in\nGreshamsbury. But this was not enough for Lady Arabella as long as\nher daughter still habitually consorted with the female culprit, and\nas long as her husband consorted with the male culprit. It seemed to\nLady Arabella at this moment as though, in banishing Mary from the\nhouse, she had in effect banished herself from the most intimate of\nthe Greshamsbury social circles. She magnified in her own mind the\nimportance of the conferences between the girls, and was not without\nsome fear that the doctor might be talking the squire over into very\ndangerous compliance.\n\nShe resolved, therefore, on another duel with the doctor. In the\nfirst she had been pre-eminently and unexpectedly successful. No\nyoung sucking dove could have been more mild than that terrible enemy\nwhom she had for years regarded as being too puissant for attack. In\nten minutes she had vanquished him, and succeeded in banishing both\nhim and his niece from the house without losing the value of his\nservices. As is always the case with us, she had begun to despise\nthe enemy she had conquered, and to think that the foe, once beaten,\ncould never rally.\n\nHer object was to break off all confidential intercourse between\nBeatrice and Mary, and to interrupt, as far as she could do it, that\nbetween the doctor and the squire. This, it may be said, could be\nmore easily done by skilful management within her own household. She\nhad, however, tried that and failed. She had said much to Beatrice as\nto the imprudence of her friendship with Mary, and she had done this\npurposely before the squire; injudiciously however,--for the squire\nhad immediately taken Mary's part, and had declared that he had no\nwish to see a quarrel between his family and that of the doctor; that\nMary Thorne was in every way a good girl, and an eligible friend for\nhis own child; and had ended by declaring, that he would not have\nMary persecuted for Frank's fault. This had not been the end, nor\nnearly the end of what had been said on the matter at Greshamsbury;\nbut the end, when it came, came in this wise, that Lady Arabella\ndetermined to say a few words to the doctor as to the expediency\nof forbidding familiar intercourse between Mary and any of the\nGreshamsbury people.\n\nWith this view Lady Arabella absolutely bearded the lion in his den,\nthe doctor in his shop. She had heard that both Mary and Beatrice\nwere to pass a certain afternoon at the parsonage, and took that\nopportunity of calling at the doctor's house. A period of many years\nhad passed since she had last so honoured that abode. Mary, indeed,\nhad been so much one of her own family that the ceremony of calling\non her had never been thought necessary; and thus, unless Mary had\nbeen absolutely ill, there would have been nothing to bring her\nladyship to the house. All this she knew would add to the importance\nof the occasion, and she judged it prudent to make the occasion as\nimportant as it might well be.\n\nShe was so far successful that she soon found herself _t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aate_\nwith the doctor in his own study. She was no whit dismayed by the\npair of human thigh-bones which lay close to his hand, and which,\nwhen he was talking in that den of his own, he was in the constant\nhabit of handling with much energy; nor was she frightened out of her\npropriety even by the little child's skull which grinned at her from\noff the chimney-piece.\n\n\"Doctor,\" she said, as soon as the first complimentary greetings were\nover, speaking in her kindest and most would-be-confidential tone,\n\"Doctor, I am still uneasy about that boy of mine, and I have thought\nit best to come and see you at once, and tell you freely what I\nthink.\"\n\nThe doctor bowed, and said that he was very sorry that she should\nhave any cause for uneasiness about his young friend Frank.\n\n\"Indeed, I am very uneasy, doctor; and having, as I do have, such\nreliance on your prudence, and such perfect confidence in your\nfriendship, I have thought it best to come and speak to you openly:\"\nthereupon the Lady Arabella paused, and the doctor bowed again.\n\n\"Nobody knows so well as you do the dreadful state of the squire's\naffairs.\"\n\n\"Not so very dreadful; not so very dreadful,\" said the doctor,\nmildly: \"that is, as far as I know.\"\n\n\"Yes they are, doctor; very dreadful; very dreadful indeed. You know\nhow much he owes to this young man: I do not, for the squire never\ntells anything to me; but I know that it is a very large sum of\nmoney; enough to swamp the estate and ruin Frank. Now I call that\nvery dreadful.\"\n\n\"No, no, not ruin him, Lady Arabella; not ruin him, I hope.\"\n\n\"However, I did not come to talk to you about that. As I said before,\nI know nothing of the squire's affairs, and, as a matter of course,\nI do not ask you to tell me. But I am sure you will agree with me in\nthis, that, as a mother, I cannot but be interested about my only\nson,\" and Lady Arabella put her cambric handkerchief to her eyes.\n\n\"Of course you are; of course you are,\" said the doctor; \"and, Lady\nArabella, my opinion of Frank is such, that I feel sure that he\nwill do well;\" and, in his energy, Dr Thorne brandished one of the\nthigh-bones almost in the lady's face.\n\n\"I hope he will; I am sure I hope he will. But, doctor, he has such\ndangers to contend with; he is so warm and impulsive that I fear\nhis heart will bring him into trouble. Now, you know, unless Frank\nmarries money he is lost.\"\n\nThe doctor made no answer to this last appeal, but as he sat and\nlistened a slight frown came across his brow.\n\n\"He must marry money, doctor. Now we have, you see, with your\nassistance, contrived to separate him from dear Mary--\"\n\n\"With my assistance, Lady Arabella! I have given no assistance, nor\nhave I meddled in the matter; nor will I.\"\n\n\"Well, doctor, perhaps not meddled; but you agreed with me, you know,\nthat the two young people had been imprudent.\"\n\n\"I agreed to no such thing, Lady Arabella; never, never. I not only\nnever agreed that Mary had been imprudent, but I will not agree to it\nnow, and will not allow any one to assert it in my presence without\ncontradicting it:\" and then the doctor worked away at the thigh-bones\nin a manner that did rather alarm her ladyship.\n\n\"At any rate, you thought that the young people had better be kept\napart.\"\n\n\"No; neither did I think that: my niece, I felt sure, was safe from\ndanger. I knew that she would do nothing that would bring either her\nor me to shame.\"\n\n\"Not to shame,\" said the lady, apologetically, as it were, using the\nword perhaps not exactly in the doctor's sense.\n\n\"I felt no alarm for her,\" continued the doctor, \"and desired no\nchange. Frank is your son, and it is for you to look to him. You\nthought proper to do so by desiring Mary to absent herself from\nGreshamsbury.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, no, no!\" said Lady Arabella.\n\n\"But you did, Lady Arabella; and as Greshamsbury is your home,\nneither I nor my niece had any ground of complaint. We acquiesced,\nnot without much suffering, but we did acquiesce; and you, I think,\ncan have no ground of complaint against us.\"\n\nLady Arabella had hardly expected that the doctor would reply to her\nmild and conciliatory exordium with so much sternness. He had yielded\nso easily to her on the former occasion. She did not comprehend that\nwhen she uttered her sentence of exile against Mary, she had given\nan order which she had the power of enforcing; but that obedience to\nthat order had now placed Mary altogether beyond her jurisdiction.\nShe was, therefore, a little surprised, and for a few moments\noverawed by the doctor's manner; but she soon recovered herself,\nremembering, doubtless, that fortune favours none but the brave.\n\n\"I make no complaint, Dr Thorne,\" she said, after assuming a tone\nmore befitting a de Courcy than that hitherto used, \"I make no\ncomplaint either as regards you or Mary.\"\n\n\"You are very kind, Lady Arabella.\"\n\n\"But I think that it is my duty to put a stop, a peremptory stop to\nanything like a love affair between my son and your niece.\"\n\n\"I have not the least objection in life. If there is such a love\naffair, put a stop to it--that is, if you have the power.\"\n\nHere the doctor was doubtless imprudent. But he had begun to think\nthat he had yielded sufficiently to the lady; and he had begun to\nresolve, also, that though it would not become him to encourage even\nthe idea of such a marriage, he would make Lady Arabella understand\nthat he thought his niece quite good enough for her son, and that\nthe match, if regarded as imprudent, was to be regarded as equally\nimprudent on both sides. He would not suffer that Mary and her heart\nand feelings and interest should be altogether postponed to those\nof the young heir; and, perhaps, he was unconsciously encouraged in\nthis determination by the reflection that Mary herself might perhaps\nbecome a young heiress.\n\n\"It is my duty,\" said Lady Arabella, repeating her words with even a\nstronger de Courcy intonation; \"and your duty also, Dr Thorne.\"\n\n\"My duty!\" said he, rising from his chair and leaning on the table\nwith the two thigh-bones. \"Lady Arabella, pray understand at once,\nthat I repudiate any such duty, and will have nothing whatever to do\nwith it.\"\n\n\"But you do not mean to say that you will encourage this unfortunate\nboy to marry your niece?\"\n\n\"The unfortunate boy, Lady Arabella--whom, by the by, I regard as\na very fortunate young man--is your son, not mine. I shall take no\nsteps about his marriage, either one way or the other.\"\n\n\"You think it right, then, that your niece should throw herself in\nhis way?\"\n\n\"Throw herself in his way! What would you say if I came up to\nGreshamsbury, and spoke to you of your daughters in such language?\nWhat would my dear friend Mr Gresham say, if some neighbour's wife\nshould come and so speak to him? I will tell you what he would say:\nhe would quietly beg her to go back to her own home and meddle only\nwith her own matters.\"\n\nThis was dreadful to Lady Arabella. Even Dr Thorne had never before\ndared thus to lower her to the level of common humanity, and liken\nher to any other wife in the country-side. Moreover, she was not\nquite sure whether he, the parish doctor, was not desiring her, the\nearl's daughter, to go home and mind her own business. On this first\npoint, however, there seemed to be no room for doubt, of which she\ngave herself the benefit.\n\n\"It would not become me to argue with you, Dr Thorne,\" she said.\n\n\"Not at least on this subject,\" said he.\n\n\"I can only repeat that I mean nothing offensive to our dear Mary;\nfor whom, I think I may say, I have always shown almost a mother's\ncare.\"\n\n\"Neither am I, nor is Mary, ungrateful for the kindness she has\nreceived at Greshamsbury.\"\n\n\"But I must do my duty: my own children must be my first\nconsideration.\"\n\n\"Of course they must, Lady Arabella; that's of course.\"\n\n\"And, therefore, I have called on you to say that I think it is\nimprudent that Beatrice and Mary should be so much together.\"\n\nThe doctor had been standing during the latter part of this\nconversation, but now he began to walk about, still holding the two\nbones like a pair of dumb-bells.\n\n\"God bless my soul!\" he said; \"God bless my soul! Why, Lady Arabella,\ndo you suspect your own daughter as well as your own son? Do you\nthink that Beatrice is assisting Mary in preparing this wicked\nclandestine marriage? I tell you fairly, Lady Arabella, the present\ntone of your mind is such that I cannot understand it.\"\n\n\"I suspect nobody, Dr Thorne; but young people will be young.\"\n\n\"And old people must be old, I suppose; the more's the pity. Lady\nArabella, Mary is the same to me as my own daughter, and owes me the\nobedience of a child; but as I do not disapprove of your daughter\nBeatrice as an acquaintance for her, but rather, on the other hand,\nregard with pleasure their friendship, you cannot expect that I\nshould take any steps to put an end to it.\"\n\n\"But suppose it should lead to renewed intercourse between Frank and\nMary?\"\n\n\"I have no objection. Frank is a very nice young fellow,\ngentleman-like in his manners, and neighbourly in his disposition.\"\n\n\"Dr Thorne--\"\n\n\"Lady Arabella--\"\n\n\"I cannot believe that you really intend to express a wish--\"\n\n\"You are quite right. I have not intended to express any wish; nor do\nI intend to do so. Mary is at liberty, within certain bounds--which\nI am sure she will not pass--to choose her own friends. I think she\nhas not chosen badly as regards Miss Beatrice Gresham; and should she\neven add Frank Gresham to the number--\"\n\n\"Friends! why they were more than friends; they were declared\nlovers.\"\n\n\"I doubt that, Lady Arabella, because I have not heard of it from\nMary. But even if it were so, I do not see why I should object.\"\n\n\"Not object!\"\n\n\"As I said before, Frank is, to my thinking, an excellent young man.\nWhy should I object?\"\n\n\"Dr Thorne!\" said her ladyship, now also rising from her chair in a\nstate of too evident perturbation.\n\n\"Why should _I_ object? It is for you, Lady Arabella, to look after\nyour lambs; for me to see that, if possible, no harm shall come to\nmine. If you think that Mary is an improper acquaintance for your\nchildren, it is for you to guide them; for you and their father. Say\nwhat you think fit to your own daughter; but pray understand, once\nfor all, that I will allow no one to interfere with my niece.\"\n\n\"Interfere!\" said Lady Arabella, now absolutely confused by the\nseverity of the doctor's manner.\n\n\"I will allow no one to interfere with her; no one, Lady Arabella.\nShe has suffered very greatly from imputations which you have most\nunjustly thrown on her. It was, however, your undoubted right to turn\nher out of your house if you thought fit;--though, as a woman who\nhad known her for so many years, you might, I think, have treated\nher with more forbearance. That, however, was your right, and you\nexercised it. There your privilege stops; yes, and must stop, Lady\nArabella. You shall not persecute her here, on the only spot of\nground she can call her own.\"\n\n\"Persecute her, Dr Thorne! You do not mean to say that I have\npersecuted her?\"\n\n\"Ah! but I do mean to say so. You do persecute her, and would\ncontinue to do so did I not defend her. It is not sufficient that\nshe is forbidden to enter your domain--and so forbidden with the\nknowledge of all the country round--but you must come here also with\nthe hope of interrupting all the innocent pleasures of her life.\nFearing lest she should be allowed even to speak to your son, to hear\na word of him through his own sister, you would put her in prison,\ntie her up, keep her from the light of day--\"\n\n\"Dr Thorne! how can you--\"\n\nBut the doctor was not to be interrupted.\n\n\"It never occurs to you to tie him up, to put him in prison. No; he\nis the heir of Greshamsbury; he is your son, an earl's grandson. It\nis only natural, after all, that he should throw a few foolish words\nat the doctor's niece. But she! it is an offence not to be forgiven\non her part that she should, however, unwillingly, have been forced\nto listen to them! Now understand me, Lady Arabella; if any of your\nfamily come to my house I shall be delighted to welcome them: if Mary\nshould meet any of them elsewhere I shall be delighted to hear of it.\nShould she tell me to-morrow that she was engaged to marry Frank, I\nshould talk the matter over with her, quite coolly, solely with a\nview to her interest, as would be my duty; feeling, at the same time,\nthat Frank would be lucky in having such a wife. Now you know my\nmind, Lady Arabella. It is so I should do my duty;--you can do yours\nas you may think fit.\"\n\nLady Arabella had by this time perceived that she was not destined on\nthis occasion to gain any great victory. She, however, was angry as\nwell as the doctor. It was not the man's vehemence that provoked her\nso much as his evident determination to break down the prestige of\nher rank, and place her on a footing in no respect superior to his\nown. He had never before been so audaciously arrogant; and, as she\nmoved towards the door, she determined in her wrath that she would\nnever again have confidential intercourse with him in any relation of\nlife whatsoever.\n\n\"Dr Thorne,\" said she. \"I think you have forgotten yourself. You must\nexcuse me if I say that after what has passed I--I--I--\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said he, fully understanding what she meant; and bowing\nlow as he opened first the study-door, then the front-door, then the\ngarden-gate.\n\nAnd then Lady Arabella stalked off, not without full observation from\nMrs Yates Umbleby and her friend Miss Gushing, who lived close by.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\nMiss Thorne Goes on a Visit\n\n\nAnd now began the unpleasant things at Greshamsbury of which we have\nhere told. When Lady Arabella walked away from the doctor's house\nshe resolved that, let it cost what it might, there should be war to\nthe knife between her and him. She had been insulted by him--so at\nleast she said to herself, and so she was prepared to say to others\nalso--and it was not to be borne that a de Courcy should allow her\nparish doctor to insult her with impunity. She would tell her husband\nwith all the dignity that she could assume, that it had now become\nabsolutely necessary that he should protect his wife by breaking\nentirely with his unmannered neighbour; and, as regarded the young\nmembers of her family, she would use the authority of a mother, and\nabsolutely forbid them to hold any intercourse with Mary Thorne. So\nresolving, she walked quickly back to her own house.\n\nThe doctor, when left alone, was not quite satisfied with the part he\nhad taken in the interview. He had spoken from impulse rather than\nfrom judgement, and, as is generally the case with men who do so\nspeak, he had afterwards to acknowledge to himself that he had been\nimprudent. He accused himself probably of more violence than he\nhad really used, and was therefore unhappy; but, nevertheless, his\nindignation was not at rest. He was angry with himself; but not\non that account the less angry with Lady Arabella. She was cruel,\noverbearing, and unreasonable; cruel in the most cruel of manners, so\nhe thought; but not on that account was he justified in forgetting\nthe forbearance due from a gentleman to a lady. Mary, moreover, had\nowed much to the kindness of this woman, and, therefore, Dr Thorne\nfelt that he should have forgiven much.\n\nThus the doctor walked about his room, much disturbed; now accusing\nhimself for having been so angry with Lady Arabella, and then feeding\nhis own anger by thinking of her misconduct.\n\nThe only immediate conclusion at which he resolved was this, that it\nwas unnecessary that he should say anything to Mary on the subject\nof her ladyship's visit. There was, no doubt, sorrow enough in store\nfor his darling; why should he aggravate it? Lady Arabella would\ndoubtless not stop now in her course; but why should he accelerate\nthe evil which she would doubtless be able to effect?\n\nLady Arabella, when she returned to the house, allowed no grass to\ngrow under her feet. As she entered the house she desired that Miss\nBeatrice should be sent to her directly she returned; and she desired\nalso, that as soon as the squire should be in his room a message to\nthat effect might be immediately brought to her.\n\n\"Beatrice,\" she said, as soon as the young lady appeared before her,\nand in speaking she assumed her firmest tone of authority, \"Beatrice,\nI am sorry, my dear, to say anything that is unpleasant to you, but I\nmust make it a positive request that you will for the future drop all\nintercourse with Dr Thorne's family.\"\n\nBeatrice, who had received Lady Arabella's message immediately on\nentering the house, and had run upstairs imagining that some instant\nhaste was required, now stood before her mother rather out of breath,\nholding her bonnet by the strings.\n\n\"Oh, mamma!\" she exclaimed, \"what on earth has happened?\"\n\n\"My dear,\" said the mother, \"I cannot really explain to you what has\nhappened; but I must ask you to give me your positive assurance that\nyou will comply with my request.\"\n\n\"You don't mean that I am not to see Mary any more?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do, my dear; at any rate, for the present. When I tell you\nthat your brother's interest imperatively demands it, I am sure that\nyou will not refuse me.\"\n\nBeatrice did not refuse, but she did not appear too willing to\ncomply. She stood silent, leaning against the end of a sofa and\ntwisting her bonnet-strings in her hand.\n\n\"Well, Beatrice--\"\n\n\"But, mamma, I don't understand.\"\n\nLady Arabella had said that she could not exactly explain: but she\nfound it necessary to attempt to do so.\n\n\"Dr Thorne has openly declared to me that a marriage between poor\nFrank and Mary is all he could desire for his niece. After such\nunparalleled audacity as that, even your father will see the\nnecessity of breaking with him.\"\n\n\"Dr Thorne! Oh, mamma, you must have misunderstood him.\"\n\n\"My dear, I am not apt to misunderstand people; especially when I am\nso much in earnest as I was in talking to Dr Thorne.\"\n\n\"But, mamma, I know so well what Mary herself thinks about it.\"\n\n\"And I know what Dr Thorne thinks about it; he, at any rate, has been\ncandid in what he said; there can be no doubt on earth that he has\nspoken his true thoughts; there can be no reason to doubt him: of\ncourse such a match would be all that he could wish.\"\n\n\"Mamma, I feel sure that there is some mistake.\"\n\n\"Very well, my dear. I know that you are infatuated about these\npeople, and that you are always inclined to contradict what I say to\nyou; but, remember, I expect that you will obey me when I tell you\nnot to go to Dr Thorne's house any more.\"\n\n\"But, mamma--\"\n\n\"I expect you to obey me, Beatrice. Though you are so prone to\ncontradict, you have never disobeyed me; and I fully trust that you\nwill not do so now.\"\n\nLady Arabella had begun by exacting, or trying to exact a promise,\nbut as she found that this was not forthcoming, she thought it better\nto give up the point without a dispute. It might be that Beatrice\nwould absolutely refuse to pay this respect to her mother's\nauthority, and then where would she have been?\n\nAt this moment a servant came up to say that the squire was in his\nroom, and Lady Arabella was opportunely saved the necessity of\ndiscussing the matter further with her daughter. \"I am now,\" she\nsaid, \"going to see your father on the same subject; you may be quite\nsure, Beatrice, that I should not willingly speak to him on any\nmatter relating to Dr Thorne did I not find it absolutely necessary\nto do so.\"\n\nThis Beatrice knew was true, and she did therefore feel convinced\nthat something terrible must have happened.\n\nWhile Lady Arabella opened her budget the squire sat quite silent,\nlistening to her with apparent respect. She found it necessary that\nher description to him should be much more elaborate than that which\nshe had vouchsafed to her daughter, and, in telling her grievance,\nshe insisted most especially on the personal insult which had been\noffered to herself.\n\n\"After what has now happened,\" said she, not quite able to repress a\ntone of triumph as she spoke, \"I do expect, Mr Gresham, that you\nwill--will--\"\n\n\"Will what, my dear?\"\n\n\"Will at least protect me from the repetition of such treatment.\"\n\n\"You are not afraid that Dr Thorne will come here to attack you? As\nfar as I can understand, he never comes near the place, unless when\nyou send for him.\"\n\n\"No; I do not think that he will come to Greshamsbury any more. I\nbelieve I have put a stop to that.\"\n\n\"Then what is it, my dear, that you want me to do?\"\n\nLady Arabella paused a minute before she replied. The game which she\nnow had to play was not very easy; she knew, or thought she knew,\nthat her husband, in his heart of hearts, much preferred his friend\nto the wife of his bosom, and that he would, if he could, shuffle out\nof noticing the doctor's iniquities. It behoved her, therefore, to\nput them forward in such a way that they must be noticed.\n\n\"I suppose, Mr Gresham, you do not wish that Frank should marry the\ngirl?\"\n\n\"I do not think there is the slightest chance of such a thing; and I\nam quite sure that Dr Thorne would not encourage it.\"\n\n\"But I tell you, Mr Gresham, that he says he will encourage it.\"\n\n\"Oh, you have misunderstood him.\"\n\n\"Of course; I always misunderstand everything. I know that. I\nmisunderstood it when I told you how you would distress yourself if\nyou took those nasty hounds.\"\n\n\"I have had other troubles more expensive than the hounds,\" said the\npoor squire, sighing.\n\n\"Oh, yes; I know what you mean; a wife and family are expensive, of\ncourse. It is a little too late now to complain of that.\"\n\n\"My dear, it is always too late to complain of any troubles when they\nare no longer to be avoided. We need not, therefore, talk any more\nabout the hounds at present.\"\n\n\"I do not wish to speak of them, Mr Gresham.\"\n\n\"Nor I.\"\n\n\"But I hope you will not think me unreasonable if I am anxious to\nknow what you intend to do about Dr Thorne.\"\n\n\"To do?\"\n\n\"Yes; I suppose you will do something: you do not wish to see your\nson marry such a girl as Mary Thorne.\"\n\n\"As far as the girl herself is concerned,\" said the squire, turning\nrather red, \"I am not sure that he could do much better. I know\nnothing whatever against Mary. Frank, however, cannot afford to make\nsuch a match. It would be his ruin.\"\n\n\"Of course it would; utter ruin; he never could hold up his head\nagain. Therefore it is I ask, What do you intend to do?\"\n\nThe squire was bothered. He had no intention whatever of doing\nanything, and no belief in his wife's assertion as to Dr Thorne's\niniquity. But he did not know how to get her out of the room. She\nasked him the same question over and over again, and on each occasion\nurged on him the heinousness of the insult to which she personally\nhad been subjected; so that at last he was driven to ask her what it\nwas she wished him to do.\n\n\"Well, then, Mr Gresham, if you ask me, I must say, that I think you\nshould abstain from any intercourse with Dr Thorne whatever.\"\n\n\"Break off all intercourse with him?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"What do you mean? He has been turned out of this house, and I'm not\nto go to see him at his own.\"\n\n\"I certainly think that you ought to discontinue your visits to Dr\nThorne altogether.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, my dear; absolute nonsense.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! Mr Gresham; it is no nonsense. As you speak in that way,\nI must let you know plainly what I feel. I am endeavouring to do\nmy duty by my son. As you justly observe, such a marriage as this\nwould be utter ruin to him. When I found that the young people were\nactually talking of being in love with each other, making vows and\nall that sort of thing, I did think it time to interfere. I did not,\nhowever, turn them out of Greshamsbury as you accuse me of doing. In\nthe kindest possible manner--\"\n\n\"Well--well--well; I know all that. There, they are gone, and that's\nenough. I don't complain; surely that ought to be enough.\"\n\n\"Enough! Mr Gresham. No; it is not enough. I find that, in spite\nof what has occurred, the closest intimacy exists between the two\nfamilies; that poor Beatrice, who is so very young, and not so\nprudent as she should be, is made to act as a go-between; and when\nI speak to the doctor, hoping that he will assist me in preventing\nthis, he not only tells me that he means to encourage Mary in her\nplans, but positively insults me to my face, laughs at me for being\nan earl's daughter, and tells me--yes, he absolutely told me--to get\nout of his house.\"\n\nLet it be told with some shame as to the squire's conduct, that his\nfirst feeling on hearing this was one of envy--of envy and regret\nthat he could not make the same uncivil request. Not that he wished\nto turn his wife absolutely out of his house; but he would have been\nvery glad to have had the power of dismissing her summarily from his\nown room. This, however, was at present impossible; so he was obliged\nto make some mild reply.\n\n\"You must have mistaken him, my dear. He could not have intended to\nsay that.\"\n\n\"Oh! of course, Mr Gresham. It is all a mistake, of course. It will\nbe a mistake, only a mistake when you find your son married to Mary\nThorne.\"\n\n\"Well, my dear, I cannot undertake to quarrel with Dr Thorne.\" This\nwas true; for the squire could hardly have quarrelled with Dr Thorne,\neven had he wished it.\n\n\"Then I think it right to tell you that I shall. And, Mr Gresham, I\ndid not expect much co-operation from you; but I did think that you\nwould have shown some little anger when you heard that I had been so\nill-treated. I shall, however, know how to take care of myself; and\nI shall continue to do the best I can to protect Frank from these\nwicked intrigues.\"\n\nSo saying, her ladyship arose and left the room, having succeeded in\ndestroying the comfort of all our Greshamsbury friends. It was very\nwell for the squire to declare that he would not quarrel with Dr\nThorne, and of course he did not do so. But he, himself, had no wish\nwhatever that his son should marry Mary Thorne; and as a falling drop\nwill hollow a stone, so did the continual harping of his wife on the\nsubject give rise to some amount of suspicion in his own mind. Then\nas to Beatrice, though she had made no promise that she would not\nagain visit Mary, she was by no means prepared to set her mother's\nauthority altogether at defiance; and she also was sufficiently\nuncomfortable.\n\nDr Thorne said nothing of the matter to his niece, and she,\ntherefore, would have been absolutely bewildered by Beatrice's\nabsence, had she not received some tidings of what had taken place at\nGreshamsbury through Patience Oriel. Beatrice and Patience discussed\nthe matter fully, and it was agreed between them that it would be\nbetter that Mary should know what sterner orders respecting her\nhad gone forth from the tyrant at Greshamsbury, and that she might\nunderstand that Beatrice's absence was compulsory. Patience was thus\nplaced in this position, that on one day she walked and talked with\nBeatrice, and on the next with Mary; and so matters went on for a\nwhile at Greshamsbury--not very pleasantly.\n\nVery unpleasantly and very uncomfortably did the months of May and\nJune pass away. Beatrice and Mary occasionally met, drinking tea\ntogether at the parsonage, or in some other of the ordinary meetings\nof country society; but there were no more confidentially distressing\nconfidential discourses, no more whispering of Frank's name, no more\nsweet allusions to the inexpediency of a passion, which, according\nto Beatrice's views, would have been so delightful had it been\nexpedient.\n\nThe squire and the doctor also met constantly; there were\nunfortunately many subjects on which they were obliged to meet. Louis\nPhilippe--or Sir Louis as we must call him--though he had no power\nover his own property, was wide awake to all the coming privileges\nof ownership, and he would constantly point out to his guardian the\nmanner in which, according to his ideas, the most should be made of\nit. The young baronet's ideas of good taste were not of the most\nrefined description, and he did not hesitate to tell Dr Thorne that\nhis, the doctor's, friendship with Mr Gresham must be no bar to his,\nthe baronet's, interest. Sir Louis also had his own lawyer, who gave\nDr Thorne to understand that, according to his ideas, the sum due\non Mr Gresham's property was too large to be left on its present\nfooting; the title-deeds, he said, should be surrendered or the\nmortgage foreclosed. All this added to the sadness which now seemed\nto envelop the village of Greshamsbury.\n\nEarly in July, Frank was to come home. The manner in which the\ncomings and goings of \"poor Frank\" were allowed to disturb the\narrangements of all the ladies, and some of the gentlemen, of\nGreshamsbury was most abominable. And yet it can hardly be said to\nhave been his fault. He would have been only too well pleased had\nthings been allowed to go on after their old fashion. Things were\nnot allowed so to go on. At Christmas Miss Oriel had submitted to be\nexiled, in order that she might carry Mary away from the presence of\nthe young Bashaw, an arrangement by which all the winter festivities\nof the poor doctor had been thoroughly sacrificed; and now it began\nto be said that some similar plan for the summer must be suggested.\n\nIt must not be supposed that any direction to this effect was\nconveyed either to Mary or to the doctor. The suggestion came from\nthem, and was mentioned only to Patience. But Patience, as a matter\nof course, told Beatrice, and Beatrice told her mother, somewhat\ntriumphantly, hoping thereby to convince the she-dragon of Mary's\ninnocence. Alas! she-dragons are not easily convinced of the\ninnocence of any one. Lady Arabella quite coincided in the propriety\nof Mary's being sent off,--whither she never inquired,--in order that\nthe coast might be clear for \"poor Frank;\" but she did not a whit the\nmore abstain from talking of the wicked intrigues of those Thornes.\nAs it turned out, Mary's absence caused her to talk all the more.\n\nThe Boxall Hill property, including the house and furniture, had been\nleft to the contractor's son; it being understood that the property\nwould not be at present in his own hands, but that he might inhabit\nthe house if he chose to do so. It would thus be necessary for Lady\nScatcherd to find a home for herself, unless she could remain at\nBoxall Hill by her son's permission. In this position of affairs the\ndoctor had been obliged to make a bargain between them. Sir Louis did\nwish to have the comfort, or perhaps the honour, of a country house;\nbut he did not wish to have the expense of keeping it up. He was\nalso willing to let his mother live at the house; but not without\na consideration. After a prolonged degree of haggling, terms were\nagreed upon; and a few weeks after her husband's death, Lady\nScatcherd found herself alone at Boxall Hill--alone as regards\nsociety in the ordinary sense, but not quite alone as concerned her\nladyship, for the faithful Hannah was still with her.\n\nThe doctor was of course often at Boxall Hill, and never left it\nwithout an urgent request from Lady Scatcherd that he would bring his\nniece over to see her. Now Lady Scatcherd was no fit companion for\nMary Thorne, and though Mary had often asked to be taken to Boxall\nHill, certain considerations had hitherto induced the doctor to\nrefuse the request; but there was that about Lady Scatcherd,--a kind\nof homely honesty of purpose, an absence of all conceit as to her own\nposition, and a strength of womanly confidence in the doctor as her\nfriend, which by degrees won upon his heart. When, therefore, both he\nand Mary felt that it would be better for her again to absent herself\nfor a while from Greshamsbury, it was, after much deliberation,\nagreed that she should go on a visit to Boxall Hill.\n\nTo Boxall Hill, accordingly, she went, and was received almost as a\nprincess. Mary had all her life been accustomed to women of rank, and\nhad never habituated herself to feel much trepidation in the presence\nof titled grandees; but she had prepared herself to be more than\nordinarily submissive to Lady Scatcherd. Her hostess was a widow, was\nnot a woman of high birth, was a woman of whom her uncle spoke well;\nand, for all these reasons, Mary was determined to respect her, and\npay to her every consideration. But when she settled down in the\nhouse she found it almost impossible to do so. Lady Scatcherd treated\nher as a farmer's wife might have treated some convalescent young\nlady who had been sent to her charge for a few weeks, in order that\nshe might benefit by the country air. Her ladyship could hardly bring\nherself to sit still and eat her dinner tranquilly in her guest's\npresence. And then nothing was good enough for Mary. Lady Scatcherd\nbesought her, almost with tears, to say what she liked best to eat\nand drink; and was in despair when Mary declared she didn't care,\nthat she liked anything, and that she was in nowise particular in\nsuch matters.\n\n\"A roast fowl, Miss Thorne?\"\n\n\"Very nice, Lady Scatcherd.\"\n\n\"And bread sauce?\"\n\n\"Bread sauce--yes; oh, yes--I like bread sauce,\"--and poor Mary tried\nhard to show a little interest.\n\n\"And just a few sausages. We make them all in the house, Miss Thorne;\nwe know what they are. And mashed potatoes--do you like them best\nmashed or baked?\"\n\nMary finding herself obliged to vote, voted for mashed potatoes.\n\n\"Very well. But, Miss Thorne, if you like boiled fowl better, with\na little bit of ham, you know, I do hope you'll say so. And there's\nlamb in the house, quite beautiful; now do 'ee say something; do 'ee,\nMiss Thorne.\"\n\nSo invoked, Mary felt herself obliged to say something, and declared\nfor the roast fowl and sausages; but she found it very difficult to\npay much outward respect to a person who would pay so much outward\nrespect to her. A day or two after her arrival it was decided that\nshe should ride about the place on a donkey; she was accustomed to\nriding, the doctor having generally taken care that one of his own\nhorses should, when required, consent to carry a lady; but there was\nno steed at Boxall Hill that she could mount; and when Lady Scatcherd\nhad offered to get a pony for her, she had willingly compromised\nmatters by expressing the delight she would have in making a campaign\non a donkey. Upon this, Lady Scatcherd had herself set off in quest\nof the desired animal, much to Mary's horror; and did not return till\nthe necessary purchase had been effected. Then she came back with the\ndonkey close at her heels, almost holding its collar, and stood there\nat the hall-door till Mary came to approve.\n\n\"I hope she'll do. I don't think she'll kick,\" said Lady Scatcherd,\npatting the head of her purchase quite triumphantly.\n\n\"Oh, you are so kind, Lady Scatcherd. I'm sure she'll do quite\nnicely; she seems very quiet,\" said Mary.\n\n\"Please, my lady, it's a he,\" said the boy who held the halter.\n\n\"Oh! a he, is it?\" said her ladyship; \"but the he-donkeys are quite\nas quiet as the shes, ain't they?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, my lady; a deal quieter, all the world over, and twice as\nuseful.\"\n\n\"I'm so glad of that, Miss Thorne,\" said Lady Scatcherd, her eyes\nbright with joy.\n\nAnd so Mary was established with her donkey, who did all that could\nbe expected from an animal in his position.\n\n\"But, dear Lady Scatcherd,\" said Mary, as they sat together at the\nopen drawing-room window the same evening, \"you must not go on\ncalling me Miss Thorne; my name is Mary, you know. Won't you call me\nMary?\" and she came and knelt at Lady Scatcherd's feet, and took hold\nof her, looking up into her face.\n\nLady Scatcherd's cheeks became rather red, as though she was somewhat\nashamed of her position.\n\n\"You are so very kind to me,\" continued Mary, \"and it seems so cold\nto hear you call me Miss Thorne.\"\n\n\"Well, Miss Thorne, I'm sure I'd call you anything to please you.\nOnly I didn't know whether you'd like it from me. Else I do think\nMary is the prettiest name in all the language.\"\n\n\"I should like it very much.\"\n\n\"My dear Roger always loved that name better than any other; ten\ntimes better. I used to wish sometimes that I'd been called Mary.\"\n\n\"Did he! Why?\"\n\n\"He once had a sister called Mary; such a beautiful creature! I\ndeclare I sometimes think you are like her.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear! then she must have been beautiful indeed!\" said Mary,\nlaughing.\n\n\"She was very beautiful. I just remember her--oh, so beautiful! she\nwas quite a poor girl, you know; and so was I then. Isn't it odd that\nI should have to be called 'my lady' now? Do you know Miss Thorne--\"\n\n\"Mary! Mary!\" said her guest.\n\n\"Ah, yes; but somehow, I hardly like to make so free; but, as I was\nsaying, I do so dislike being called 'my lady:' I always think the\npeople are laughing at me; and so they are.\"\n\n\"Oh, nonsense.\"\n\n\"Yes, they are though: poor dear Roger, he used to call me 'my lady'\njust to make fun of me; I didn't mind it so much from him. But, Miss\nThorne--\"\n\n\"Mary, Mary, Mary.\"\n\n\"Ah, well! I shall do it in time. But, Miss--Mary, ha! ha! ha! never\nmind, let me alone. But what I want to say is this: do you think I\ncould drop it? Hannah says, that if I go the right way about it she\nis sure I can.\"\n\n\"Oh! but, Lady Scatcherd, you shouldn't think of such a thing.\"\n\n\"Shouldn't I now?\"\n\n\"Oh, no; for your husband's sake you should be proud of it. He gained\ngreat honour, you know.\"\n\n\"Ah, well,\" said she, sighing after a short pause; \"if you think it\nwill do him any good, of course I'll put up with it. And then I know\nLouis would be mad if I talked of such a thing. But, Miss Thorne,\ndear, a woman like me don't like to have to be made a fool of all the\ndays of her life if she can help it.\"\n\n\"But, Lady Scatcherd,\" said Mary, when this question of the title had\nbeen duly settled, and her ladyship made to understand that she must\nbear the burden for the rest of her life, \"but, Lady Scatcherd, you\nwere speaking of Sir Roger's sister; what became of her?\"\n\n\"Oh, she did very well at last, as Sir Roger did himself; but in\nearly life she was very unfortunate--just at the time of my marriage\nwith dear Roger--,\" and then, just as she was about to commence so\nmuch as she knew of the history of Mary Scatcherd, she remembered\nthat the author of her sister-in-law's misery had been a Thorne, a\nbrother of the doctor; and, therefore, as she presumed, a relative of\nher guest; and suddenly she became mute.\n\n\"Well,\" said Mary; \"just as you were married, Lady Scatcherd?\"\n\nPoor Lady Scatcherd had very little worldly knowledge, and did not\nin the least know how to turn the conversation or escape from the\ntrouble into which she had fallen. All manner of reflections began to\ncrowd upon her. In her early days she had known very little of the\nThornes, nor had she thought much of them since, except as regarded\nher friend the doctor; but at this moment she began for the first\ntime to remember that she had never heard of more than two brothers in\nthe family. Who then could have been Mary's father? She felt at once\nthat it would be improper for to say anything as to Henry Thorne's\nterrible faults and sudden fate;--improper also, to say more about\nMary Scatcherd; but she was quite unable to drop the matter otherwise\nthan abruptly, and with a start.\n\n\"She was very unfortunate, you say, Lady Scatcherd?\"\n\n\"Yes, Miss Thorne; Mary, I mean--never mind me--I shall do it in\ntime. Yes, she was; but now I think of it, I had better say nothing\nmore about it. There are reasons, and I ought not to have spoken of\nit. You won't be provoked with me, will you?\"\n\nMary assured her that she would not be provoked, and of course asked\nno more questions about Mary Scatcherd; nor did she think much more\nabout it. It was not so however with her ladyship, who could not\nkeep herself from reflecting that the old clergyman in the Close at\nBarchester certainly had but two sons, one of whom was now the doctor\nat Greshamsbury, and the other of whom had perished so wretchedly at\nthe gate of that farmyard. Who then was the father of Mary Thorne?\n\nThe days passed very quietly at Boxall Hill. Every morning Mary went\nout on her donkey, who justified by his demeanour all that had been\nsaid in his praise; then she would read or draw, then walk with Lady\nScatcherd, then dine, then walk again; and so the days passed quietly\naway. Once or twice a week the doctor would come over and drink his\ntea there, riding home in the cool of the evening. Mary also received\none visit from her friend Patience.\n\nSo the days passed quietly away till the tranquillity of the house\nwas suddenly broken by tidings from London. Lady Scatcherd received a\nletter from her son, contained in three lines, in which he intimated\nthat on the following day he meant to honour her with a visit. He had\nintended, he said, to have gone to Brighton with some friends; but as\nhe felt himself a little out of sorts, he would postpone his marine\ntrip and do his mother the grace of spending a few days with her.\n\nThis news was not very pleasant to Mary, by whom it had been\nunderstood, as it had also by her uncle, that Lady Scatcherd would\nhave had the house to herself; but as there were no means of\npreventing the evil, Mary could only inform the doctor, and prepare\nherself to meet Sir Louis Scatcherd.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\nThe Doctor Hears Something to His Advantage\n\n\nSir Louis Scatcherd had told his mother that he was rather out of\nsorts, and when he reached Boxall Hill it certainly did not appear\nthat he had given any exaggerated statement of his own maladies. He\ncertainly was a good deal out of sorts. He had had more than one\nattack of delirium tremens since his father's death, and had almost\nbeen at death's door.\n\nNothing had been said about this by Dr Thorne at Boxall Hill; but\nhe was by no means ignorant of his ward's state. Twice he had gone\nup to London to visit him; twice he had begged him to go down into\nthe country and place himself under his mother's care. On the last\noccasion, the doctor had threatened him with all manner of pains and\npenalties: with pains, as to his speedy departure from this world and\nall its joys; and with penalties, in the shape of poverty if that\ndeparture should by any chance be retarded. But these threats had\nat the moment been in vain, and the doctor had compromised matters\nby inducing Sir Louis to promise that he would go to Brighton. The\nbaronet, however, who was at length frightened by some renewed\nattack, gave up his Brighton scheme, and, without any notice to the\ndoctor, hurried down to Boxall Hill.\n\nMary did not see him on the first day of his coming, but the doctor\ndid. He received such intimation of the visit as enabled him to be at\nthe house soon after the young man's arrival; and, knowing that his\nassistance might be necessary, he rode over to Boxall Hill. It was\na dreadful task to him, this of making the same fruitless endeavour\nfor the son that he had made for the father, and in the same house.\nBut he was bound by every consideration to perform the task. He had\npromised the father that he would do for the son all that was in his\npower; and he had, moreover, the consciousness, that should Sir Louis\nsucceed in destroying himself, the next heir to all the property was\nhis own niece, Mary Thorne.\n\nHe found Sir Louis in a low, wretched, miserable state. Though he\nwas a drunkard as his father was, he was not at all such a drunkard\nas was his father. The physical capacities of the men were very\ndifferent. The daily amount of alcohol which the father had consumed\nwould have burnt up the son in a week; whereas, though the son\nwas continually tipsy, what he swallowed would hardly have had an\ninjurious effect upon the father.\n\n\"You are all wrong, quite wrong,\" said Sir Louis, petulantly; \"it\nisn't that at all. I have taken nothing this week past--literally\nnothing. I think it's the liver.\"\n\nDr Thorne wanted no one to tell him what was the matter with his\nward. It was his liver; his liver, and his head, and his stomach, and\nhis heart. Every organ in his body had been destroyed, or was in the\ncourse of destruction. His father had killed himself with brandy;\nthe son, more elevated in his tastes, was doing the same thing with\ncura\u00c3\u00a7oa, maraschino, and cherry-bounce.\n\n\"Sir Louis,\" said the doctor--he was obliged to be much more\npunctilious with him than he had been with the contractor--\"the\nmatter is in your own hands entirely: if you cannot keep your lips\nfrom that accursed poison, you have nothing in this world to look\nforward to; nothing, nothing!\"\n\nMary proposed to return with her uncle to Greshamsbury, and he was\nat first well inclined that she should do so. But this idea was\noverruled, partly in compliance with Lady Scatcherd's entreaties, and\npartly because it would have seemed as though they had both thought\nthe presence of its owner had made the house an unfit habitation for\ndecent people. The doctor therefore returned, leaving Mary there; and\nLady Scatcherd busied herself between her two guests.\n\nOn the next day Sir Louis was able to come down to a late dinner, and\nMary was introduced to him. He had dressed himself in his best array;\nand as he had--at any rate for the present moment--been frightened\nout of his libations, he was prepared to make himself as agreeable as\npossible. His mother waited on him almost as a slave might have done;\nbut she seemed to do so with the fear of a slave rather than the love\nof a mother. She was fidgety in her attentions, and worried him by\nendeavouring to make her evening sitting-room agreeable.\n\nBut Sir Louis, though he was not very sweetly behaved under these\nmanipulations from his mother's hands, was quite complaisant to\nMiss Thorne; nay, after the expiration of a week he was almost more\nthan complaisant. He piqued himself on his gallantry, and now found\nthat, in the otherwise dull seclusion of Boxall Hill, he had a good\nopportunity of exercising it. To do him justice it must be admitted\nthat he would not have been incapable of a decent career had he\nstumbled upon some girl who could have loved him before he stumbled\nupon his maraschino bottle. Such might have been the case with many\na lost rake. The things that are bad are accepted because the things\nthat are good do not come easily in his way. How many a miserable\nfather reviles with bitterness of spirit the low tastes of his son,\nwho has done nothing to provide his child with higher pleasures!\n\nSir Louis--partly in the hopes of Mary's smiles, and partly\nfrightened by the doctor's threats--did, for a while, keep himself\nwithin decent bounds. He did not usually appear before Mary's eyes\ntill three or four in the afternoon; but when he did come forth, he\ncame forth sober and resolute to please. His mother was delighted,\nand was not slow to sing his praises; and even the doctor, who now\nvisited Boxall Hill more frequently than ever, began to have some\nhopes.\n\nOne constant subject, I must not say of conversation, on the part\nof Lady Scatcherd, but rather of declamation, had hitherto been the\nbeauty and manly attributes of Frank Gresham. She had hardly ceased\nto talk to Mary of the infinite good qualities of the young squire,\nand especially of his prowess in the matter of Mr Moffat. Mary had\nlistened to all this eloquence, not perhaps with inattention, but\nwithout much reply. She had not been exactly sorry to hear Frank\ntalked about; indeed, had she been so minded, she could herself have\nsaid something on the same subject; but she did not wish to take Lady\nScatcherd altogether into her confidence, and she had been unable to\nsay much about Frank Gresham without doing so. Lady Scatcherd had,\ntherefore, gradually conceived the idea that her darling was not a\nfavourite with her guest.\n\nNow, therefore, she changed the subject; and, as her own son was\nbehaving with such unexampled propriety, she dropped Frank and\nconfined her eulogies to Louis. He had been a little wild, she\nadmitted; young men so often were so; but she hoped that it was now\nover.\n\n\"He does still take a little drop of those French drinks in the\nmorning,\" said Lady Scatcherd, in her confidence; for she was too\nhonest to be false, even in her own cause. \"He does do that, I know:\nbut that's nothing, my dear, to swilling all day; and everything\ncan't be done at once, can it, Miss Thorne?\"\n\nOn this subject Mary found her tongue loosened. She could not talk\nabout Frank Gresham, but she could speak with hope to the mother of\nher only son. She could say that Sir Louis was still very young; that\nthere was reason to trust that he might now reform; that his present\nconduct was apparently good; and that he appeared capable of better\nthings. So much she did say; and the mother took her sympathy for\nmore than it was worth.\n\nOn this matter, and on this matter perhaps alone, Sir Louis and Lady\nScatcherd were in accord. There was much to recommend Mary to the\nbaronet; not only did he see her to be beautiful, and perceive her\nto be attractive and ladylike; but she was also the niece of the man\nwho, for the present, held the purse-strings of his wealth. Mary, it\nis true, had no fortune. But Sir Louis knew that she was acknowledged\nto be a lady; and he was ambitious that his \"lady\" should be a lady.\nThere was also much to recommend Mary to the mother, to any mother;\nand thus it came to pass, that Miss Thorne had no obstacle between\nher and the dignity of being Lady Scatcherd the second;--no obstacle\nwhatever, if only she could bring herself to wish it.\n\nIt was some time--two or three weeks, perhaps--before Mary's mind was\nfirst opened to this new brilliancy in her prospects. Sir Louis at\nfirst was rather afraid of her, and did not declare his admiration\nin any very determined terms. He certainly paid her many compliments\nwhich, from any one else, she would have regarded as abominable.\nBut she did not expect great things from the baronet's taste: she\nconcluded that he was only doing what he thought a gentleman should\ndo; and she was willing to forgive much for Lady Scatcherd's sake.\n\nHis first attempts were, perhaps, more ludicrous than passionate. He\nwas still too much an invalid to take walks, and Mary was therefore\nsaved from his company in her rambles; but he had a horse of his own\nat Boxall Hill, and had been advised to ride by the doctor. Mary\nalso rode--on a donkey only, it is true--but Sir Louis found himself\nbound in gallantry to accompany her. Mary's steed had answered every\nexpectation, and proved himself very quiet; so quiet, that without\nthe admonition of a cudgel behind him, he could hardly be persuaded\ninto the demurest trot. Now, as Sir Louis's horse was of a very\ndifferent mettle, he found it rather difficult not to step faster\nthan his inamorata; and, let him struggle as he would, was generally\nso far ahead as to be debarred the delights of conversation.\n\nWhen for the second time he proposed to accompany her, Mary did what\nshe could to hinder it. She saw that he had been rather ashamed of\nthe manner in which his companion was mounted, and she herself would\nhave enjoyed her ride much more without him. He was an invalid,\nhowever; it was necessary to make much of him, and Mary did not\nabsolutely refuse his offer.\n\n\"Lady Scatcherd,\" said he, as they were standing at the door previous\nto mounting--he always called his mother Lady Scatcherd--\"why don't\nyou have a horse for Miss Thorne? This donkey is--is--really is, so\nvery--very--can't go at all, you know?\"\n\nLady Scatcherd began to declare that she would willingly have got a\npony if Mary would have let her do so.\n\n\"Oh, no, Lady Scatcherd; not on any account. I do like the donkey so\nmuch--I do indeed.\"\n\n\"But he won't go,\" said Sir Louis. \"And for a person who rides like\nyou, Miss Thorne--such a horsewoman you know--why, you know, Lady\nScatcherd, it's positively ridiculous; d---- absurd, you know.\"\n\nAnd then, with an angry look at his mother, he mounted his horse, and\nwas soon leading the way down the avenue.\n\n\"Miss Thorne,\" said he, pulling himself up at the gate, \"if I had\nknown that I was to be so extremely happy as to have found you here,\nI would have brought you down the most beautiful creature, an Arab.\nShe belongs to my friend Jenkins; but I wouldn't have stood at any\nprice in getting her for you. By Jove! if you were on that mare, I'd\nback you, for style and appearance, against anything in Hyde Park.\"\n\nThe offer of this sporting wager, which naturally would have been\nvery gratifying to Mary, was lost upon her, for Sir Louis had again\nunwittingly got on in advance, but he stopped himself in time to hear\nMary again declare her passion was a donkey.\n\n\"If you could only see Jenkins's little mare, Miss Thorne! Only say\none word, and she shall be down here before the week's end. Price\nshall be no obstacle--none whatever. By Jove, what a pair you would\nbe!\"\n\nThis generous offer was repeated four or five times; but on each\noccasion Mary only half heard what was said, and on each occasion the\nbaronet was far too much in advance to hear Mary's reply. At last he\nrecollected that he wanted to call on one of the tenants, and begged\nhis companion to allow him to ride on.\n\n\"If you at all dislike being left alone, you know--\"\n\n\"Oh dear no, not at all, Sir Louis. I am quite used to it.\"\n\n\"Because I don't care about it, you know; only I can't make this\nhorse walk the same pace as that brute.\"\n\n\"You mustn't abuse my pet, Sir Louis.\"\n\n\"It's a d---- shame on my mother's part;\" said Sir Louis, who, even\nwhen in his best behaviour, could not quite give up his ordinary mode\nof conversation. \"When she was fortunate enough to get such a girl as\nyou to come and stay with her, she ought to have had something proper\nfor her to ride upon; but I'll look to it as soon as I am a little\nstronger, you see if I don't;\" and, so saying, Sir Louis trotted off,\nleaving Mary in peace with her donkey.\n\nSir Louis had now been living cleanly and forswearing sack for what\nwas to him a very long period, and his health felt the good effects\nof it. No one rejoiced at this more cordially than did the doctor. To\nrejoice at it was with him a point of conscience. He could not help\ntelling himself now and again that, circumstanced as he was, he was\nmost specially bound to take joy in any sign of reformation which\nthe baronet might show. Not to do so would be almost tantamount\nto wishing that he might die in order that Mary might inherit his\nwealth; and, therefore, the doctor did with all his energy devote\nhimself to the difficult task of hoping and striving that Sir Louis\nmight yet live to enjoy what was his own. But the task was altogether\na difficult one, for as Sir Louis became stronger in health, so\nalso did he become more exorbitant in his demands on the doctor's\npatience, and more repugnant to the doctor's tastes.\n\nIn his worst fits of disreputable living he was ashamed to apply to\nhis guardian for money; and in his worst fits of illness he was,\nthrough fear, somewhat patient under his doctor's hands; but just at\npresent he had nothing of which to be ashamed, and was not at all\npatient.\n\n\"Doctor,\"--said he, one day, at Boxall Hill--\"how about those\nGreshamsbury title-deeds?\"\n\n\"Oh, that will all be properly settled between my lawyer and your\nown.\"\n\n\"Oh--ah--yes; no doubt the lawyers will settle it: settle it with a\nfine bill of costs, of course. But, as Finnie says,\"--Finnie was Sir\nLouis's legal adviser--\"I have got a tremendously large interest at\nstake in this matter; eighty thousand pounds is no joke. It ain't\neverybody that can shell out eighty thousand pounds when they're\nwanted; and I should like to know how the thing's going on. I've a\nright to ask, you know; eh, doctor?\"\n\n\"The title-deeds of a large portion of the Greshamsbury estate will\nbe placed with the mortgage-deeds before the end of next month.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's all right. I choose to know about these things; for\nthough my father did make such a con-found-ed will, that's no reason\nI shouldn't know how things are going.\"\n\n\"You shall know everything that I know, Sir Louis.\"\n\n\"And now, doctor, what are we to do about money?\"\n\n\"About money?\"\n\n\"Yes; money, rhino, ready! 'put money in your purse and cut a dash;'\neh, doctor? Not that I want to cut a dash. No, I'm going on the quiet\nline altogether now: I've done with all that sort of thing.\"\n\n\"I'm heartily glad of it; heartily,\" said the doctor.\n\n\"Yes, I'm not going to make way for my far-away cousin yet; not if I\nknow it, at least. I shall soon be all right now, doctor; shan't I?\"\n\n\"'All right' is a long word, Sir Louis. But I do hope you will be all\nright in time, if you will live with decent prudence. You shouldn't\ntake that filth in the morning though.\"\n\n\"Filth in the morning! That's my mother, I suppose! That's her\nladyship! She's been talking, has she? Don't you believe her, doctor.\nThere's not a young man in Barsetshire is going more regular, all\nright within the posts, than I am.\"\n\nThe doctor was obliged to acknowledge that there did seem to be some\nimprovement.\n\n\"And now, doctor, how about money? Eh?\"\n\nDoctor Thorne, like other guardians similarly circumstanced, began to\nexplain that Sir Louis had already had a good deal of money, and had\nbegun also to promise that more should be forthcoming in the event\nof good behaviour, when he was somewhat suddenly interrupted by Sir\nLouis.\n\n\"Well, now; I'll tell you what, doctor; I've got a bit of news for\nyou; something that I think will astonish you.\"\n\nThe doctor opened his eyes, and tried to look as though ready to be\nsurprised.\n\n\"Something that will really make you look about; and something, too,\nthat will be very much to the hearer's advantage,--as the newspaper\nadvertisements say.\"\n\n\"Something to my advantage?\" said the doctor.\n\n\"Well, I hope you'll think so. Doctor, what would you think now of my\ngetting married?\"\n\n\"I should be delighted to hear of it--more delighted than I can\nexpress; that is, of course, if you were to marry well. It was your\nfather's most eager wish that you should marry early.\"\n\n\"That's partly my reason,\" said the young hypocrite. \"But then, if I\nmarry I must have an income fit to live on; eh, doctor?\"\n\nThe doctor had some fear that his interesting prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9e was desirous\nof a wife for the sake of the income, instead of desiring the income\nfor the sake of the wife. But let the cause be what it would,\nmarriage would probably be good for him; and he had no hesitation,\ntherefore, in telling him, that if he married well, he should be put\nin possession of sufficient income to maintain the new Lady Scatcherd\nin a manner becoming her dignity.\n\n\"As to marrying well,\" said Sir Louis, \"you, I take it, will be the\nlast man, doctor, to quarrel with my choice.\"\n\n\"Shall I?\" said the doctor, smiling.\n\n\"Well, you won't disapprove, I guess, as the Yankee says. What would\nyou think of Miss Mary Thorne?\"\n\nIt must be said in Sir Louis's favour that he had probably no idea\nwhatever of the estimation in which such young ladies as Mary Thorne\nare held by those who are nearest and dearest to them. He had no sort\nof conception that she was regarded by her uncle as an inestimable\ntreasure, almost too precious to be rendered up to the arms of any\nman; and infinitely beyond any price in silver and gold, baronets'\nincomes of eight or ten thousand a year, and such coins usually\ncurrent in the world's markets. He was a rich man and a baronet,\nand Mary was an unmarried girl without a portion. In Sir Louis's\nestimation he was offering everything, and asking for nothing. He\ncertainly had some idea that girls were apt to be coy, and required\na little wooing in the shape of presents, civil speeches--perhaps\nkisses also. The civil speeches he had, he thought, done, and\nimagined that they had been well received. The other things were to\nfollow; an Arab pony, for instance,--and the kisses probably with it;\nand then all these difficulties would be smoothed.\n\nBut he did not for a moment conceive that there would be any\ndifficulty with the uncle. How should there be? Was he not a baronet\nwith ten thousand a year coming to him? Had he not everything which\nfathers want for portionless daughters, and uncles for dependant\nnieces? Might he not well inform the doctor that he had something to\ntell him for his advantage?\n\nAnd yet, to tell the truth, the doctor did not seem to be overjoyed\nwhen the announcement was first made to him. He was by no means\noverjoyed. On the contrary, even Sir Louis could perceive his\nguardian's surprise was altogether unmixed with delight.\n\nWhat a question was this that was asked him! What would he think of\na marriage between Mary Thorne--his Mary and Sir Louis Scatcherd?\nBetween the alpha of the whole alphabet, and him whom he could not\nbut regard as the omega! Think of it! Why he would think of it as\nthough a lamb and a wolf were to stand at the altar together. Had Sir\nLouis been a Hottentot, or an Esquimaux, the proposal could not have\nastonished him more. The two persons were so totally of a different\nclass, that the idea of the one falling in love with the other had\nnever occurred to him. \"What would you think of Miss Mary Thorne?\"\nSir Louis had asked; and the doctor, instead of answering him\nwith ready and pleased alacrity, stood silent, thunderstruck with\namazement.\n\n\"Well, wouldn't she be a good wife?\" said Sir Louis, rather in a tone\nof disgust at the evident disapproval shown at his choice. \"I thought\nyou'd have been so delighted.\"\n\n\"Mary Thorne!\" ejaculated the doctor at last. \"Have you spoken to my\nniece about this, Sir Louis?\"\n\n\"Well, I have and yet I haven't; I haven't, and yet in a manner I\nhave.\"\n\n\"I don't understand you,\" said the doctor.\n\n\"Why, you see, I haven't exactly popped to her yet; but I have been\ndoing the civil; and if she's up to snuff, as I take her to be, she\nknows very well what I'm after by this time.\"\n\nUp to snuff! Mary Thorne, his Mary Thorne, up to snuff! To snuff too\nof such a very disagreeable description!\n\n\"I think, Sir Louis, that you are in mistake about this. I think you\nwill find that Mary will not be disposed to avail herself of the\ngreat advantages--for great they undoubtedly are--which you are able\nto offer to your intended wife. If you will take my advice, you will\ngive up thinking of Mary. She would not suit you.\"\n\n\"Not suit me! Oh, but I think she just would. She's got no money, you\nmean?\"\n\n\"No, I did not mean that. It will not signify to you whether your\nwife has money or not. You need not look for money. But you should\nthink of some one more nearly of your own temperament. I am quite\nsure that my niece would refuse you.\"\n\nThese last words the doctor uttered with much emphasis. His intention\nwas to make the baronet understand that the matter was quite\nhopeless, and to induce him if possible to drop it on the spot. But\nhe did not know Sir Louis; he ranked him too low in the scale of\nhuman beings, and gave him no credit for any strength of character.\nSir Louis in his way did love Mary Thorne; and could not bring\nhimself to believe that Mary did not, or at any rate, would not soon\nreturn his passion. He was, moreover, sufficiently obstinate, firm we\nought perhaps to say,--for his pursuit in this case was certainly not\nan evil one,--and he at once made up his mind to succeed in spite of\nthe uncle.\n\n\"If she consents, however, you will do so too?\" asked he.\n\n\"It is impossible she should consent,\" said the doctor.\n\n\"Impossible! I don't see anything at all impossible. But if she\ndoes?\"\n\n\"But she won't.\"\n\n\"Very well,--that's to be seen. But just tell me this, if she does,\nwill you consent?\"\n\n\"The stars would fall first. It's all nonsense. Give it up, my dear\nfriend; believe me you are only preparing unhappiness for yourself;\"\nand the doctor put his hand kindly on the young man's arm. \"She will\nnot, cannot accept such an offer.\"\n\n\"Will not! cannot!\" said the baronet, thinking over all the reasons\nwhich in his estimation could possibly be inducing the doctor to be\nso hostile to his views, and shaking the hand off his arm. \"Will not!\ncannot! But come, doctor, answer my question fairly. If she'll have\nme for better or worse, you won't say aught against it; will you?\"\n\n\"But she won't have you; why should you give her and yourself the\npain of a refusal?\"\n\n\"Oh, as for that, I must stand my chances like another. And as for\nher, why d----, doctor, you wouldn't have me believe that any young\nlady thinks it so very dreadful to have a baronet with ten thousand\npounds a year at her feet, specially when that same baronet ain't\nvery old, nor yet particularly ugly. I ain't so green as that,\ndoctor.\"\n\n\"I suppose she must go through it, then,\" said the doctor, musing.\n\n\"But, Dr Thorne, I did look for a kinder answer from you, considering\nall that you so often say about your great friendship with my father.\nI did think you'd at any rate answer me when I asked you a question.\"\n\nBut the doctor did not want to answer that special question. Could\nit be possible that Mary should wish to marry this odious man, could\nsuch a state of things be imagined to be the case, he would not\nrefuse his consent, infinitely as he would be disgusted by her\nchoice. But he would not give Sir Louis any excuse for telling Mary\nthat her uncle approved of so odious a match.\n\n\"I cannot say that in any case I should approve of such a marriage,\nSir Louis. I cannot bring myself to say so; for I know it would make\nyou both miserable. But on that matter my niece will choose wholly\nfor herself.\"\n\n\"And about the money, doctor?\"\n\n\"If you marry a decent woman you shall not want the means of\nsupporting her decently,\" and so saying the doctor walked away,\nleaving Sir Louis to his meditations.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\nThe Donkey Ride\n\n\nSir Louis, when left to himself, was slightly dismayed and somewhat\ndiscouraged; but he was not induced to give up his object. The first\neffort of his mind was made in conjecturing what private motive\nDr Thorne could possibly have in wishing to debar his niece from\nmarrying a rich young baronet. That the objection was personal to\nhimself, Sir Louis did not for a moment imagine. Could it be that the\ndoctor did not wish that his niece should be richer, and grander, and\naltogether bigger than himself? Or was it possible that his guardian\nwas anxious to prevent him from marrying from some view of the\nreversion of the large fortune? That there was some such reason, Sir\nLouis was well sure; but let it be what it might, he would get the\nbetter of the doctor. \"He knew,\" so he said to himself, \"what stuff\ngirls were made of. Baronets did not grow like blackberries.\" And so,\nassuring himself with such philosophy, he determined to make his\noffer.\n\nThe time he selected for doing this was the hour before dinner; but\non the day on which his conversation with the doctor had taken place,\nhe was deterred by the presence of a strange visitor. To account for\nthis strange visit it will be necessary that we should return to\nGreshamsbury for a few minutes.\n\nFrank, when he returned home for his summer vacation, found that\nMary had again flown; and the very fact of her absence added fuel to\nthe fire of his love, more perhaps than even her presence might have\ndone. For the flight of the quarry ever adds eagerness to the pursuit\nof the huntsman. Lady Arabella, moreover, had a bitter enemy; a\nfoe, utterly opposed to her side in the contest, where she had once\nfondly looked for her staunchest ally. Frank was now in the habit\nof corresponding with Miss Dunstable, and received from her most\nenergetic admonitions to be true to the love which he had sworn. True\nto it he resolved to be; and therefore, when he found that Mary was\nflown, he resolved to fly after her.\n\nHe did not, however, do this till he had been in a measure provoked\nto it by it by the sharp-tongued cautions and blunted irony of his\nmother. It was not enough for her that she had banished Mary out of\nthe parish, and made Dr Thorne's life miserable; not enough that\nshe harassed her husband with harangues on the constant subject of\nFrank's marrying money, and dismayed Beatrice with invectives against\nthe iniquity of her friend. The snake was so but scotched; to kill it\noutright she must induce Frank utterly to renounce Miss Thorne.\n\nThis task she essayed, but not exactly with success. \"Well, mother,\"\nsaid Frank, at last turning very red, partly with shame, and partly\nwith indignation, as he made the frank avowal, \"since you press me\nabout it, I tell you fairly that my mind is made up to marry Mary\nsooner or later, if--\"\n\n\"Oh, Frank! good heavens! you wicked boy; you are saying this\npurposely to drive me distracted.\"\n\n\"If,\" continued Frank, not attending to his mother's interjections,\n\"if she will consent.\"\n\n\"Consent!\" said Lady Arabella. \"Oh, heavens!\" and falling into the\ncorner of the sofa, she buried her face in her handkerchief.\n\n\"Yes, mother, if she will consent. And now that I have told you so\nmuch, it is only just that I should tell you this also; that as far\nas I can see at present I have no reason to hope that she will do\nso.\"\n\n\"Oh, Frank, the girl is doing all she can to catch you,\" said Lady\nArabella,--not prudently.\n\n\"No, mother; there you wrong her altogether; wrong her most cruelly.\"\n\n\"You ungracious, wicked boy! you call me cruel!\"\n\n\"I don't call you cruel; but you wrong her cruelly, most cruelly.\nWhen I have spoken to her about this--for I have spoken to her--she\nhas behaved exactly as you would have wanted her to do; but not at\nall as I wished her. She has given me no encouragement. You have\nturned her out among you\"--Frank was beginning to be very bitter\nnow--\"but she has done nothing to deserve it. If there has been any\nfault it has been mine. But it is well that we should all understand\neach other. My intention is to marry Mary if I can.\" And, so\nspeaking, certainly without due filial respect, he turned towards the\ndoor.\n\n\"Frank,\" said his mother, raising herself up with energy to make one\nlast appeal. \"Frank, do you wish to see me die of a broken heart?\"\n\n\"You know, mother, I would wish to make you happy, if I could.\"\n\n\"If you wish to see me ever happy again, if you do not wish to see\nme sink broken-hearted to my grave, you must give up this mad idea,\nFrank,\"--and now all Lady Arabella's energy came out. \"Frank there is\nbut one course left open to you. You MUST _marry money_.\" And then\nLady Arabella stood up before her son as Lady Macbeth might have\nstood, had Lady Macbeth lived to have a son of Frank's years.\n\n\"Miss Dunstable, I suppose,\" said Frank, scornfully. \"No, mother; I\nmade an ass, and worse than an ass of myself once in that way, and I\nwon't do it again. I hate money.\"\n\n\"Oh, Frank!\"\n\n\"I hate money.\"\n\n\"But, Frank, the estate?\"\n\n\"I hate the estate--at least I shall hate it if I am expected to buy\nit at such a price as that. The estate is my father's.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, Frank; it is not.\"\n\n\"It is in the sense I mean. He may do with it as he pleases; he will\nnever have a word of complaint from me. I am ready to go into a\nprofession to-morrow. I'll be a lawyer, or a doctor, or an engineer;\nI don't care what.\" Frank, in his enthusiasm, probably overlooked\nsome of the preliminary difficulties. \"Or I'll take a farm under him,\nand earn my bread that way; but, mother, don't talk to me any more\nabout marrying money.\" And, so saying, Frank left the room.\n\nFrank, it will be remembered, was twenty-one when he was first\nintroduced to the reader; he is now twenty-two. It may be said that\nthere was a great difference between his character then and now. A\nyear at that period will make a great difference; but the change has\nbeen, not in his character, but in his feelings.\n\nFrank went out from his mother and immediately ordered his black\nhorse to be got ready for him. He would at once go over to Boxall\nHill. He went himself to the stables to give his orders; and as he\nreturned to get his gloves and whip he met Beatrice in the corridor.\n\n\"Beatrice,\" said he, \"step in here,\" and she followed him into his\nroom. \"I'm not going to bear this any longer; I'm going to Boxall\nHill.\"\n\n\"Oh, Frank! how can you be so imprudent?\"\n\n\"You, at any rate, have some decent feeling for Mary. I believe you\nhave some regard for her; and therefore I tell you. Will you send her\nany message?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; my best, best love; that is if you will see her; but,\nFrank, you are very foolish, very; and she will be infinitely\ndistressed.\"\n\n\"Do not mention this, that is, not at present; not that I mean to\nmake any secret of it. I shall tell my father everything. I'm off\nnow!\" and then, paying no attention to her remonstrance, he turned\ndown the stairs and was soon on horseback.\n\nHe took the road to Boxall Hill, but he did not ride very fast: he\ndid not go jauntily as a jolly, thriving wooer; but musingly, and\noften with diffidence, meditating every now and then whether it\nwould not be better for him to turn back: to turn back--but not from\nfear of his mother; not from prudential motives; not because that\noften-repeated lesson as to marrying money was beginning to take\neffect; not from such causes as these; but because he doubted how he\nmight be received by Mary.\n\nHe did, it is true, think something about his worldly prospects. He\nhad talked rather grandiloquently to his mother as to his hating\nmoney, and hating the estate. His mother's never-ceasing worldly\ncares on such subjects perhaps demanded that a little grandiloquence\nshould be opposed to them. But Frank did not hate the estate; nor did\nhe at all hate the position of an English country gentleman. Miss\nDunstable's eloquence, however, rang in his ears. For Miss Dunstable\nhad an eloquence of her own, even in her letters. \"Never let them\ntalk you out of your own true, honest, hearty feelings,\" she had\nsaid. \"Greshamsbury is a very nice place, I am sure; and I hope I\nshall see it some day; but all its green knolls are not half so nice,\nshould not be half so precious, as the pulses of your own heart. That\nis your own estate, your own, your very own--your own and another's;\nwhatever may go to the money-lenders, don't send that there. Don't\nmortgage that, Mr Gresham.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Frank, pluckily, as he put his horse into a faster trot,\n\"I won't mortgage that. They may do what they like with the estate;\nbut my heart's my own,\" and so speaking to himself, almost aloud, he\nturned a corner of the road rapidly and came at once upon the doctor.\n\n\"Hallo, doctor! is that you?\" said Frank, rather disgusted.\n\n\"What! Frank! I hardly expected to meet you here,\" said Dr Thorne,\nnot much better pleased.\n\nThey were now not above a mile from Boxall Hill, and the doctor,\ntherefore, could not but surmise whither Frank was going. They had\nrepeatedly met since Frank's return from Cambridge, both in the\nvillage and in the doctor's house; but not a word had been said\nbetween them about Mary beyond what the merest courtesy had required.\nNot that each did not love the other sufficiently to make a full\nconfidence between them desirable to both; but neither had had the\ncourage to speak out.\n\nNor had either of them the courage to do so now. \"Yes,\" said Frank,\nblushing, \"I am going to Lady Scatcherd's. Shall I find the ladies at\nhome?\"\n\n\"Yes; Lady Scatcherd is there; but Sir Louis is there also--an\ninvalid: perhaps you would not wish to meet him.\"\n\n\"Oh! I don't mind,\" said Frank, trying to laugh; \"he won't bite, I\nsuppose?\"\n\nThe doctor longed in his heart to pray to Frank to return with him;\nnot to go and make further mischief; not to do that which might cause\na more bitter estrangement between himself and the squire. But he had\nnot the courage to do it. He could not bring himself to accuse Frank\nof being in love with his niece. So after a few more senseless words\non either side, words which each knew to be senseless as he uttered\nthem, they both rode on their own ways.\n\nAnd then the doctor silently, and almost unconsciously, made such a\ncomparison between Louis Scatcherd and Frank Gresham as Hamlet made\nbetween the dead and live king. It was Hyperion to a satyr. Was it\nnot as impossible that Mary should not love the one, as that she\nshould love the other? Frank's offer of his affections had at first\nprobably been but a boyish ebullition of feeling; but if it should\nnow be, that this had grown into a manly and disinterested love, how\ncould Mary remain unmoved? What could her heart want more, better,\nmore beautiful, more rich than such a love as his? Was he not\npersonally all that a girl could like? Were not his disposition,\nmind, character, acquirements, all such as women most delight to\nlove? Was it not impossible that Mary should be indifferent to him?\n\nSo meditated the doctor as he rode along, with only too true a\nknowledge of human nature. Ah! it was impossible, it was quite\nimpossible that Mary should be indifferent. She had never been\nindifferent since Frank had uttered his first half-joking word of\nlove. Such things are more important to women than they are to men,\nto girls than they are to boys. When Frank had first told her that he\nloved her; aye, months before that, when he merely looked his love,\nher heart had received the whisper, had acknowledged the glance,\nunconscious as she was herself, and resolved as she was to rebuke his\nadvances. When, in her hearing, he had said soft nothings to Patience\nOriel, a hated, irrepressible tear had gathered in her eye. When he\nhad pressed in his warm, loving grasp the hand which she had offered\nhim as a token of mere friendship, her heart had forgiven him the\ntreachery, nay, almost thanked him for it, before her eyes or\nher words had been ready to rebuke him. When the rumour of his\nliaison with Miss Dunstable reached her ears, when she heard of\nMiss Dunstable's fortune, she had wept, wept outright, in her\nchamber--wept, as she said to herself, to think that he should be so\nmercenary; but she had wept, as she should have said to herself, at\nfinding that he was so faithless. Then, when she knew at last that\nthis rumour was false, when she found that she was banished from\nGreshamsbury for his sake, when she was forced to retreat with her\nfriend Patience, how could she but love him, in that he was not\nmercenary? How could she not love him in that he was so faithful?\n\nIt was impossible that she should not love him. Was he not the\nbrightest and the best of men that she had ever seen, or was like\nto see?--that she could possibly ever see, she would have said to\nherself, could she have brought herself to own the truth? And then,\nwhen she heard how true he was, how he persisted against father,\nmother, and sisters, how could it be that that should not be a merit\nin her eyes which was so great a fault in theirs? When Beatrice, with\nwould-be solemn face, but with eyes beaming with feminine affection,\nwould gravely talk of Frank's tender love as a terrible misfortune,\nas a misfortune to them all, to Mary herself as well as others, how\ncould Mary do other than love him? \"Beatrice is his sister,\" she\nwould say within her own mind, \"otherwise she would never talk like\nthis; were she not his sister, she could not but know the value of\nsuch love as this.\" Ah! yes; Mary did love him; love him with all the\nstrength of her heart; and the strength of her heart was very great.\nAnd now by degrees, in those lonely donkey-rides at Boxall Hill, in\nthose solitary walks, she was beginning to own to herself the truth.\n\nAnd now that she did own it, what should be her course? What should\nshe do, how should she act if this loved one persevered in his\nlove? And, ah! what should she do, how should she act if he did not\npersevere? Could it be that there should be happiness in store for\nher? Was it not too clear that, let the matter go how it would, there\nwas no happiness in store for her? Much as she might love Frank\nGresham, she could never consent to be his wife unless the squire\nwould smile on her as his daughter-in-law. The squire had been\nall that was kind, all that was affectionate. And then, too, Lady\nArabella! As she thought of the Lady Arabella a sterner form of\nthought came across her brow. Why should Lady Arabella rob her of her\nheart's joy? What was Lady Arabella that she, Mary Thorne, need quail\nbefore her? Had Lady Arabella stood only in her way, Lady Arabella,\nflanked by the de Courcy legion, Mary felt that she could have\ndemanded Frank's hand as her own before them all without a blush of\nshame or a moment's hesitation. Thus, when her heart was all but\nready to collapse within her, would she gain some little strength by\nthinking of the Lady Arabella.\n\n\"Please, my lady, here be young squoire Gresham,\" said one of the\nuntutored servants at Boxall Hill, opening Lady Scatcherd's little\nparlour door as her ladyship was amusing herself by pulling down and\nturning, and re-folding, and putting up again, a heap of household\nlinen which was kept in a huge press for the express purpose of\nsupplying her with occupation.\n\nLady Scatcherd, holding a vast counterpane in her arms, looked back\nover her shoulders and perceived that Frank was in the room. Down\nwent the counterpane on the ground, and Frank soon found himself in\nthe very position which that useful article had so lately filled.\n\n\"Oh! Master Frank! oh, Master Frank!\" said her ladyship, almost in an\nhysterical fit of joy; and then she hugged and kissed him as she had\nnever kissed and hugged her own son since that son had first left the\nparent nest.\n\nFrank bore it patiently and with a merry laugh. \"But, Lady\nScatcherd,\" said he, \"what will they all say? you forget I am a man\nnow,\" and he stooped his head as she again pressed her lips upon his\nforehead.\n\n\"I don't care what none of 'em say,\" said her ladyship, quite going\nback to her old days; \"I will kiss my own boy; so I will. Eh, but\nMaster Frank, this is good of you. A sight of you is good for sore\neyes; and my eyes have been sore enough too since I saw you;\" and she\nput her apron up to wipe away a tear.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Frank, gently trying to disengage himself, but not\nsuccessfully; \"yes, you have had a great loss, Lady Scatcherd. I was\nso sorry when I heard of your grief.\"\n\n\"You always had a soft, kind heart, Master Frank; so you had. God's\nblessing on you! What a fine man you have grown! Deary me! Well, it\nseems as though it were only just t'other day like.\" And she pushed\nhim a little off from her, so that she might look the better into his\nface.\n\n\"Well. Is it all right? I suppose you would hardly know me again now\nI've got a pair of whiskers?\"\n\n\"Know you! I should know you well if I saw but the heel of your\nfoot. Why, what a head of hair you have got, and so dark too! but it\ndoesn't curl as it used once.\" And she stroked his hair, and looked\ninto his eyes, and put her hand to his cheeks. \"You'll think me an\nold fool, Master Frank: I know that; but you may think what you like.\nIf I live for the next twenty years you'll always be my own boy; so\nyou will.\"\n\nBy degrees, slow degrees, Frank managed to change the conversation,\nand to induce Lady Scatcherd to speak on some other topic than his\nown infantine perfections. He affected an indifference as he spoke of\nher guest, which would have deceived no one but Lady Scatcherd; but\nher it did deceive; and then he asked where Mary was.\n\n\"She's just gone out on her donkey--somewhere about the place. She\nrides on a donkey mostly every day. But you'll stop and take a bit of\ndinner with us? Eh, now do 'ee, Master Frank.\"\n\nBut Master Frank excused himself. He did not choose to pledge himself\nto sit down to dinner with Mary. He did not know in what mood they\nmight return with regard to each other at dinner-time. He said,\ntherefore, that he would walk out and, if possible, find Miss Thorne;\nand that he would return to the house again before he went.\n\nLady Scatcherd then began making apologies for Sir Louis. He was an\ninvalid; the doctor had been with him all the morning, and he was not\nyet out of his room.\n\nThese apologies Frank willingly accepted, and then made his way as\nhe could on to the lawn. A gardener, of whom he inquired, offered to\ngo with him in pursuit of Miss Thorne. This assistance, however, he\ndeclined, and set forth in quest of her, having learnt what were her\nmost usual haunts. Nor was he directed wrongly; for after walking\nabout twenty minutes, he saw through the trees the legs of a donkey\nmoving on the green-sward, at about two hundred yards from him. On\nthat donkey doubtless sat Mary Thorne.\n\nThe donkey was coming towards him; not exactly in a straight line,\nbut so much so as to make it impossible that Mary should not see him\nif he stood still. He did stand still, and soon emerging from the\ntrees, Mary saw him all but close to her.\n\nHer heart gave a leap within her, but she was so far mistress of\nherself as to repress any visible sign of outward emotion. She did\nnot fall from her donkey, or scream, or burst into tears. She merely\nuttered the words, \"Mr Gresham!\" in a tone of not unnatural surprise.\n\n\"Yes,\" said he, trying to laugh, but less successful than she had\nbeen in suppressing a show of feeling. \"Mr Gresham! I have come over\nat last to pay my respects to you. You must have thought me very\nuncourteous not to do so before.\"\n\nThis she denied. \"She had not,\" she said, \"thought him at all\nuncivil. She had come to Boxall Hill to be out of the way; and, of\ncourse, had not expected any such formalities.\" As she uttered this\nshe almost blushed at the abrupt truth of what she was saying. But\nshe was taken so much unawares that she did not know how to make the\ntruth other than abrupt.\n\n\"To be out of the way!\" said Frank. \"And why should you want to be\nout of the way?\"\n\n\"Oh! there were reasons,\" said she, laughing. \"Perhaps I have\nquarrelled dreadfully with my uncle.\"\n\nFrank at the present moment had not about him a scrap of badinage. He\nhad not a single easy word at his command. He could not answer her\nwith anything in guise of a joke; so he walked on, not answering at\nall.\n\n\"I hope all my friends at Greshamsbury are well,\" said Mary. \"Is\nBeatrice quite well?\"\n\n\"Quite well,\" said he.\n\n\"And Patience?\"\n\n\"What, Miss Oriel; yes, I believe so. I haven't seen her this day or\ntwo.\" How was it that Mary felt a little flush of joy, as Frank spoke\nin this indifferent way about Miss Oriel's health?\n\n\"I thought she was always a particular friend of yours,\" said she.\n\n\"What! who? Miss Oriel? So she is! I like her amazingly; so does\nBeatrice.\" And then he walked about six steps in silence, plucking up\ncourage for the great attempt. He did pluck up his courage and then\nrushed at once to the attack.\n\n\"Mary!\" said he, and as he spoke he put his hand on the donkey's\nneck, and looked tenderly into her face. He looked tenderly, and, as\nMary's ear at once told her, his voice sounded more soft than it had\never sounded before. \"Mary, do you remember the last time that we\nwere together?\"\n\nMary did remember it well. It was on that occasion when he had\ntreacherously held her hand; on that day when, according to law, he\nhad become a man; when he had outraged all the propriety of the de\nCourcy interest by offering his love to Mary in Augusta's hearing.\nMary did remember it well; but how was she to speak of it? \"It was\nyour birthday, I think,\" said she.\n\n\"Yes, it was my birthday. I wonder whether you remember what I said\nto you then?\"\n\n\"I remember that you were very foolish, Mr Gresham.\"\n\n\"Mary, I have come to repeat my folly;--that is, if it be folly.\nI told you then that I loved you, and I dare say that I did so\nawkwardly, like a boy. Perhaps I may be just as awkward now; but you\nought at any rate to believe me when you find that a year has not\naltered me.\"\n\nMary did not think him at all awkward, and she did believe him. But\nhow was she to answer him? She had not yet taught herself what answer\nshe ought to make if he persisted in his suit. She had hitherto been\ncontent to run away from him; but she had done so because she would\nnot submit to be accused of the indelicacy of putting herself in his\nway. She had rebuked him when he first spoke of his love; but she had\ndone so because she looked on what he said as a boy's nonsense. She\nhad schooled herself in obedience to the Greshamsbury doctrines. Was\nthere any real reason, any reason founded on truth and honesty, why\nshe should not be a fitting wife to Frank Gresham,--Francis Newbold\nGresham, of Greshamsbury, though he was, or was to be?\n\nHe was well born--as well born as any gentleman in England. She\nwas basely born--as basely born as any lady could be. Was this\nsufficient bar against such a match? Mary felt in her heart that some\ntwelvemonth since, before she knew what little she did now know of\nher own story, she would have said it was so. And would she indulge\nher own love by inveigling him she loved into a base marriage? But\nthen reason spoke again. What, after all, was this blood of which she\nhad taught herself to think so much? Would she have been more honest,\nmore fit to grace an honest man's hearthstone, had she been the\nlegitimate descendant of a score of legitimate duchesses? Was it not\nher first duty to think of him--of what would make him happy? Then of\nher uncle--what he would approve? Then of herself--what would best\nbecome her modesty; her sense of honour? Could it be well that she\nshould sacrifice the happiness of two persons to a theoretic love of\npure blood?\n\nSo she had argued within herself; not now, sitting on the donkey,\nwith Frank's hand before her on the tame brute's neck; but on other\nformer occasions as she had ridden along demurely among those trees.\nSo she had argued; but she had never brought her arguments to a\ndecision. All manner of thoughts crowded on her to prevent her doing\nso. She would think of the squire, and resolve to reject Frank; and\nwould then remember Lady Arabella, and resolve to accept him. Her\nresolutions, however, were most irresolute; and so, when Frank\nappeared in person before her, carrying his heart in his hand, she\ndid not know what answer to make to him. Thus it was with her as with\nso many other maidens similarly circumstanced; at last she left it\nall to chance.\n\n\"You ought, at any rate, to believe me,\" said Frank, \"when you find\nthat a year has not altered me.\"\n\n\"A year should have taught you to be wiser,\" said she. \"You should\nhave learnt by this time, Mr Gresham, that your lot and mine are not\ncast in the same mould; that our stations in life are different.\nWould your father or mother approve of your even coming here to see\nme?\"\n\nMary, as she spoke these sensible words, felt that they were \"flat,\nstale, and unprofitable.\" She felt, also, that they were not true in\nsense; that they did not come from her heart; that they were not such\nas Frank deserved at her hands, and she was ashamed of herself.\n\n\"My father I hope will approve of it,\" said he. \"That my mother\nshould disapprove of it is a misfortune which I cannot help; but\non this point I will take no answer from my father or mother; the\nquestion is one too personal to myself. Mary, if you say that you\nwill not, or cannot return my love, I will go away;--not from here\nonly, but from Greshamsbury. My presence shall not banish you from\nall that you hold dear. If you can honestly say that I am nothing to\nyou, can be nothing to you, I will then tell my mother that she may\nbe at ease, and I will go away somewhere and get over it as I may.\"\nThe poor fellow got so far, looking apparently at the donkey's ears,\nwith hardly a gasp of hope in his voice, and he so far carried Mary\nwith him that she also had hardly a gasp of hope in her heart. There\nhe paused for a moment, and then looking up into her face, he spoke\nbut one word more. \"But,\" said he--and there he stopped. It was\nclearly told in that \"but.\" Thus would he do if Mary would declare\nthat she did not care for him. If, however, she could not bring\nherself so to declare, then was he ready to throw his father and\nmother to the winds; then would he stand his ground; then would he\nlook all other difficulties in the face, sure that they might finally\nbe overcome. Poor Mary! the whole onus of settling the matter was\nthus thrown upon her. She had only to say that he was indifferent to\nher;--that was all.\n\nIf \"all the blood of the Howards\" had depended upon it, she could\nnot have brought herself to utter such a falsehood. Indifferent to\nher, as he walked there by her donkey's side, talking thus earnestly\nof his love for her! Was he not to her like some god come from the\nheavens to make her blessed? Did not the sun shine upon him with a\nhalo, so that he was bright as an angel? Indifferent to her! Could\nthe open unadulterated truth have been practicable for her, she\nwould have declared her indifference in terms that would truly have\nastonished him. As it was, she found it easier to say nothing. She\nbit her lips to keep herself from sobbing. She struggled hard, but\nin vain, to prevent her hands and feet from trembling. She seemed to\nswing upon her donkey as though like to fall, and would have given\nmuch to be upon her own feet upon the sward.\n\n\"_Si la jeunesse savait . . ._\" There is so much in that wicked old\nFrench proverb! Had Frank known more about a woman's mind--had he,\nthat is, been forty-two instead of twenty-two--he would at once have\nbeen sure of his game, and have felt that Mary's silence told him\nall he wished to know. But then, had he been forty-two instead of\ntwenty-two, he would not have been so ready to risk the acres of\nGreshamsbury for the smiles of Mary Thorne.\n\n\"If you can't say one word to comfort me, I will go,\" said he,\ndisconsolately. \"I made up my mind to tell you this, and so I came\nover. I told Lady Scatcherd I should not stay,--not even for dinner.\"\n\n\"I did not know you were so hurried,\" said she, almost in a whisper.\n\nOn a sudden he stood still, and pulling the donkey's rein, caused him\nto stand still also. The beast required very little persuasion to be\nso guided, and obligingly remained meekly passive.\n\n\"Mary, Mary!\" said Frank, throwing his arms round her knees as she\nsat upon her steed, and pressing his face against her body. \"Mary,\nyou were always honest; be honest now. I love you with all my heart.\nWill you be my wife?\"\n\nBut still Mary said not a word. She no longer bit her lips; she was\nbeyond that, and was now using all her efforts to prevent her tears\nfrom falling absolutely on her lover's face. She said nothing. She\ncould no more rebuke him now and send him from her than she could\nencourage him. She could only sit there shaking and crying and\nwishing she was on the ground. Frank, on the whole, rather liked the\ndonkey. It enabled him to approach somewhat nearer to an embrace than\nhe might have found practicable had they both been on their feet. The\ndonkey himself was quite at his ease, and looked as though he was\napprovingly conscious of what was going on behind his ears.\n\n\"I have a right to a word, Mary; say 'Go,' and I will leave you at\nonce.\"\n\nBut Mary did not say \"Go.\" Perhaps she would have done so had she\nbeen able; but just at present she could say nothing. This came from\nher having failed to make up her mind in due time as to what course\nit would best become her to follow.\n\n\"One word, Mary; one little word. There, if you will not speak,\nhere is my hand. If you will have it, let it lie in yours;--if not,\npush it away.\" So saying, he managed to get the end of his fingers\non to her palm, and there it remained unrepulsed. \"La jeunesse\"\nwas beginning to get a lesson; experience when duly sought after\nsometimes comes early in life.\n\nIn truth Mary had not strength to push the fingers away. \"My love,\nmy own, my own!\" said Frank, presuming on this very negative sign of\nacquiescence. \"My life, my own one, my own Mary!\" and then the hand\nwas caught hold of and was at his lips before an effort could be made\nto save it from such treatment.\n\n\"Mary, look at me; say one word to me.\"\n\nThere was a deep sigh, and then came the one word--\"Oh, Frank!\"\n\n\"Mr Gresham, I hope I have the honour of seeing you quite well,\"\nsaid a voice close to his ear. \"I beg to say that you are welcome to\nBoxall Hill.\" Frank turned round and instantly found himself shaking\nhands with Sir Louis Scatcherd.\n\nHow Mary got over her confusion Frank never saw, for he had enough\nto do to get over his own. He involuntarily deserted Mary and began\ntalking very fast to Sir Louis. Sir Louis did not once look at Miss\nThorne, but walked back towards the house with Mr Gresham, sulky\nenough in temper, but still making some effort to do the fine\ngentleman. Mary, glad to be left alone, merely occupied herself with\nsitting on the donkey; and the donkey, when he found that the two\ngentlemen went towards the house, for company's sake and for his\nstable's sake, followed after them.\n\nFrank stayed but three minutes in the house; gave another kiss to\nLady Scatcherd, getting three in return, and thereby infinitely\ndisgusting Sir Louis, shook hands, anything but warmly, with the\nyoung baronet, and just felt the warmth of Mary's hand within his\nown. He felt also the warmth of her eyes' last glance, and rode home\na happy man.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\nPost Prandial\n\n\nFrank rode home a happy man, cheering himself, as successful lovers\ndo cheer themselves, with the brilliancy of his late exploit: nor was\nit till he had turned the corner into the Greshamsbury stables that\nhe began to reflect what he would do next. It was all very well to\nhave induced Mary to allow his three fingers to lie half a minute\nin her soft hand; the having done so might certainly be sufficient\nevidence that he had overcome one of the lions in his path; but it\ncould hardly be said that all his difficulties were now smoothed. How\nwas he to make further progress?\n\nTo Mary, also, the same ideas no doubt occurred--with many others.\nBut, then, it was not for Mary to make any progress in the matter. To\nher at least belonged this passive comfort, that at present no act\nhostile to the de Courcy interest would be expected from her. All\nthat she could do would be to tell her uncle so much as it was\nfitting that he should know. The doing this would doubtless be in\nsome degree difficult; but it was not probable that there would be\nmuch difference, much of anything but loving anxiety for each other,\nbetween her and Dr Thorne. One other thing, indeed, she must do;\nFrank must be made to understand what her birth had been. \"This,\" she\nsaid to herself, \"will give him an opportunity of retracting what\nhe has done should he choose to avail himself of it. It is well he\nshould have such opportunity.\"\n\nBut Frank had more than this to do. He had told Beatrice that he\nwould make no secret of his love, and he fully resolved to be as good\nas his word. To his father he owed an unreserved confidence; and he\nwas fully minded to give it. It was, he knew, altogether out of the\nquestion that he should at once marry a portionless girl without his\nfather's consent; probably out of the question that he should do so\neven with it. But he would, at any rate, tell his father, and then\ndecide as to what should be done next. So resolving, he put his black\nhorse into the stable and went in to dinner. After dinner he and his\nfather would be alone.\n\nYes; after dinner he and his father would be alone. He dressed\nhimself hurriedly, for the dinner-bell was almost on the stroke as he\nentered the house. He said this to himself once and again; but when\nthe meats and the puddings, and then the cheese, were borne away,\nas the decanters were placed before his father, and Lady Arabella\nsipped her one glass of claret, and his sisters ate their portion of\nstrawberries, his pressing anxiety for the coming interview began to\nwax somewhat dull.\n\nHis mother and sisters, however, rendered him no assistance by\nprolonging their stay. With unwonted assiduity he pressed a second\nglass of claret on his mother. But Lady Arabella was not only\ntemperate in her habits, but also at the present moment very angry\nwith her son. She thought that he had been to Boxall Hill, and was\nonly waiting a proper moment to cross-question him sternly on the\nsubject. Now she departed, taking her train of daughters with her.\n\n\"Give me one big gooseberry,\" said Nina, as she squeezed herself in\nunder her brother's arm, prior to making her retreat. Frank would\nwillingly have given her a dozen of the biggest, had she wanted them;\nbut having got the one, she squeezed herself out again and scampered\noff.\n\nThe squire was very cheery this evening; from what cause cannot now\nbe said. Perhaps he had succeeded in negotiating a further loan, thus\ntemporarily sprinkling a drop of water over the ever-rising dust of\nhis difficulties.\n\n\"Well, Frank, what have you been after to-day? Peter told me you had\nthe black horse out,\" said he, pushing the decanter to his son. \"Take\nmy advice, my boy, and don't give him too much summer road-work. Legs\nwon't stand it, let them be ever so good.\"\n\n\"Why, sir, I was obliged to go out to-day, and therefore, it had to\nbe either the old mare or the young horse.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you take Ramble?\" Now Ramble was the squire's own saddle\nhack, used for farm surveying, and occasionally for going to cover.\n\n\"I shouldn't think of doing that, sir.\"\n\n\"My dear boy, he is quite at your service; for goodness' sake do let\nme have a little wine, Frank--quite at your service; any riding I\nhave now is after the haymakers, and that's all on the grass.\"\n\n\"Thank'ee, sir. Well, perhaps I will take a turn out of Ramble should\nI want it.\"\n\n\"Do, and pray, pray take care of that black horse's legs. He's\nturning out more of a horse than I took him to be, and I should be\nsorry to see him injured. Where have you been to-day?\"\n\n\"Well, father, I have something to tell you.\"\n\n\"Something to tell me!\" and then the squire's happy and gay look,\nwhich had been only rendered more happy and more gay by his assumed\nanxiety about the black horse, gave place to that heaviness of visage\nwhich acrimony and misfortune had made so habitual to him. \"Something\nto tell me!\" Any grave words like these always presaged some money\ndifficulty to the squire's ears. He loved Frank with the tenderest\nlove. He would have done so under almost any circumstances; but,\ndoubtless, that love had been made more palpable to himself by the\nfact that Frank had been a good son as regards money--not exigeant\nas was Lady Arabella, or selfishly reckless as was his nephew Lord\nPorlock. But now Frank must be in difficulty about money. This was\nhis first idea. \"What is it, Frank; you have seldom had anything\nto say that has not been pleasant for me to hear?\" And then the\nheaviness of visage again gave way for a moment as his eye fell upon\nhis son.\n\n\"I have been to Boxall Hill, sir.\"\n\nThe tenor of his father's thoughts was changed in an instant; and the\ndread of immediate temporary annoyance gave place to true anxiety for\nhis son. He, the squire, had been no party to Mary's exile from his\nown domain; and he had seen with pain that she had now a second time\nbeen driven from her home: but he had never hitherto questioned the\nexpediency of separating his son from Mary Thorne. Alas! it became\ntoo necessary--too necessary through his own default--that Frank\nshould marry money!\n\n\"At Boxall Hill, Frank! Has that been prudent? Or, indeed, has it\nbeen generous to Miss Thorne, who has been driven there, as it were,\nby your imprudence?\"\n\n\"Father, it is well that we should understand each other about\nthis--\"\n\n\"Fill your glass, Frank;\" Frank mechanically did as he was told, and\npassed the bottle.\n\n\"I should never forgive myself were I to deceive you, or keep\nanything from you.\"\n\n\"I believe it is not in your nature to deceive me, Frank.\"\n\n\"The fact is, sir, that I have made up my mind that Mary Thorne shall\nbe my wife--sooner or later that is, unless, of course, she should\nutterly refuse. Hitherto, she has utterly refused me. I believe I may\nnow say that she has accepted me.\"\n\nThe squire sipped his claret, but at the moment said nothing. There\nwas a quiet, manly, but yet modest determination about his son\nthat he had hardly noticed before. Frank had become legally of\nage, legally a man, when he was twenty-one. Nature, it seems, had\npostponed the ceremony till he was twenty-two. Nature often does\npostpone the ceremony even to a much later age;--sometimes,\naltogether forgets to accomplish it.\n\nThe squire continued to sip his claret; he had to think over the\nmatter a while before he could answer a statement so deliberately\nmade by his son.\n\n\"I think I may say so,\" continued Frank, with perhaps unnecessary\nmodesty. \"She is so honest that, had she not intended it, she\nwould have said so honestly. Am I right, father, in thinking that,\nas regards Mary, personally, you would not reject her as a\ndaughter-in-law?\"\n\n\"Personally!\" said the squire, glad to have the subject presented to\nhim in a view that enabled him to speak out. \"Oh, no; personally, I\nshould not object to her, for I love her dearly. She is a good girl.\nI do believe she is a good girl in every respect. I have always liked\nher; liked to see her about the house. But--\"\n\n\"I know what you would say, father.\" This was rather more than the\nsquire knew himself. \"Such a marriage is imprudent.\"\n\n\"It is more than that, Frank; I fear it is impossible.\"\n\n\"Impossible! No, father; it is not impossible.\"\n\n\"It is impossible, Frank, in the usual sense. What are you to live\nupon? What would you do with your children? You would not wish to see\nyour wife distressed and comfortless.\"\n\n\"No, I should not like to see that.\"\n\n\"You would not wish to begin life as an embarrassed man and end it\nas a ruined man. If you were now to marry Miss Thorne such would, I\nfear, doubtless be your lot.\"\n\nFrank caught at the word \"now.\" \"I don't expect to marry immediately.\nI know that would be imprudent. But I am pledged, father, and I\ncertainly cannot go back. And now that I have told you all this, what\nis your advice to me?\"\n\nThe father again sat silent, still sipping his wine. There was\nnothing in his son that he could be ashamed of, nothing that he could\nmeet with anger, nothing that he could not love; but how should he\nanswer him? The fact was, that the son had more in him than the\nfather; this his mind and spirit were of a calibre not to be opposed\nsuccessfully by the mind and spirit of the squire.\n\n\"Do you know Mary's history?\" said Mr Gresham, at last; \"the history\nof her birth?\"\n\n\"Not a word of it,\" said Frank. \"I did not know she had a history.\"\n\n\"Nor does she know it; at least, I presume not. But you should know\nit now. And, Frank, I will tell it you; not to turn you from her--not\nwith that object, though I think that, to a certain extent, it should\nhave that effect. Mary's birth was not such as would become your wife\nand be beneficial to your children.\"\n\n\"If so, father, I should have known that sooner. Why was she brought\nin here among us?\"\n\n\"True, Frank. The fault is mine; mine and your mother's.\nCircumstances brought it about years ago, when it never occurred to\nus that all this would arise. But I will tell you her history. And,\nFrank, remember this, though I tell it you as a secret, a secret to\nbe kept from all the world but one, you are quite at liberty to let\nthe doctor know that I have told you. Indeed, I shall be careful to\nlet him know myself should it ever be necessary that he and I should\nspeak together as to this engagement.\" The squire then told his son\nthe whole story of Mary's birth, as it is known to the reader.\n\nFrank sat silent, looking very blank; he also had, as had every\nGresham, a great love for his pure blood. He had said to his mother\nthat he hated money, that he hated the estate; but he would have been\nvery slow to say, even in his warmest opposition to her, that he\nhated the roll of the family pedigree. He loved it dearly, though he\nseldom spoke of it;--as men of good family seldom do speak of it. It\nis one of those possessions which to have is sufficient. A man having\nit need not boast of what he has, or show it off before the world.\nBut on that account he values it more. He had regarded Mary as a\ncutting duly taken from the Ullathorne tree; not, indeed, as a\ngrafting branch, full of flower, just separated from the parent\nstalk, but as being not a whit the less truly endowed with the pure\nsap of that venerable trunk. When, therefore, he heard her true\nhistory he sat awhile dismayed.\n\n\"It is a sad story,\" said the father.\n\n\"Yes, sad enough,\" said Frank, rising from his chair and standing\nwith it before him, leaning on the back of it. \"Poor Mary, poor Mary!\nShe will have to learn it some day.\"\n\n\"I fear so, Frank;\" and then there was again a few moments' silence.\n\n\"To me, father, it is told too late. It can now have no effect on me.\nIndeed,\" said he, sighing as he spoke, but still relieving himself by\nthe very sigh, \"it could have had no effect had I learned it ever so\nsoon.\"\n\n\"I should have told you before,\" said the father; \"certainly I ought\nto have done so.\"\n\n\"It would have been no good,\" said Frank. \"Ah, sir, tell me this: who\nwere Miss Dunstable's parents? What was that fellow Moffat's family?\"\n\nThis was perhaps cruel of Frank. The squire, however, made no answer\nto the question. \"I have thought it right to tell you,\" said he.\n\"I leave all commentary to yourself. I need not tell you what your\nmother will think.\"\n\n\"What did she think of Miss Dunstable's birth?\" said he, again more\nbitterly than before. \"No, sir,\" he continued, after a further pause.\n\"All that can make no change; none at any rate now. It can't make my\nlove less, even if it could have prevented it. Nor, even, could it do\nso--which it can't the least, not in the least--but could it do so,\nit could not break my engagement. I am now engaged to Mary Thorne.\"\n\nAnd then he again repeated his question, asking for his father's\nadvice under the present circumstances. The conversation was a very\nlong one, as long as to disarrange all Lady Arabella's plans. She\nhad determined to take her son most stringently to task that very\nevening; and with this object had ensconced herself in the small\ndrawing-room which had formerly been used for a similar purpose by\nthe august countess herself. Here she now sat, having desired Augusta\nand Beatrice, as well as the twins, to beg Frank to go to her as soon\nas he should come out of the dining-room. Poor lady! there she waited\ntill ten o'clock,--tealess. There was not much of the Bluebeard about\nthe squire; but he had succeeded in making it understood through the\nhousehold that he was not to be interrupted by messages from his wife\nduring the post-prandial hour, which, though no toper, he loved so\nwell.\n\nAs a period of twelve months will now have to be passed over, the\nupshot of this long conversation must be told in as few words as\npossible. The father found it impracticable to talk his son out of\nhis intended marriage; indeed, he hardly attempted to do so by any\ndirect persuasion. He explained to him that it was impossible that he\nshould marry at once, and suggested that he, Frank, was very young.\n\n\"You married, sir, before you were one-and-twenty,\" said Frank. Yes,\nand repented before I was two-and-twenty. So did not say the squire.\n\nHe suggested that Mary should have time to ascertain what would be\nher uncle's wishes, and ended by inducing Frank to promise, that\nafter taking his degree in October he would go abroad for some\nmonths, and that he would not indeed return to Greshamsbury till he\nwas three-and-twenty.\n\n\"He may perhaps forget her,\" said the father to himself, as this\nagreement was made between them.\n\n\"He thinks that I shall forget her,\" said Frank to himself at the\nsame time; \"but he does not know me.\"\n\nWhen Lady Arabella at last got hold of her son she found that the\ntime for her preaching was utterly gone by. He told her, almost with\n_sang-froid_, what his plans were; and when she came to understand\nthem, and to understand also what had taken place at Boxall Hill, she\ncould not blame the squire for what he had done. She also said to\nherself, more confidently than the squire had done, that Frank would\nquite forget Mary before the year was out. \"Lord Buckish,\" said she\nto herself, rejoicingly, \"is now with the ambassador at Paris\"--Lord\nBuckish was her nephew--\"and with him Frank will meet women that are\nreally beautiful--women of fashion. When with Lord Buckish he will\nsoon forget Mary Thorne.\"\n\nBut not on this account did she change her resolve to follow up\nto the furthest point her hostility to the Thornes. She was fully\nenabled now to do so, for Dr Fillgrave was already reinstalled at\nGreshamsbury as her medical adviser.\n\nOne other short visit did Frank pay to Boxall Hill, and one interview\nhad he with Dr Thorne. Mary told him all she knew of her own sad\nhistory, and was answered only by a kiss,--a kiss absolutely not in\nany way by her to be avoided; the first, the only one, that had ever\nyet reached her lips from his. And then he went away.\n\nThe doctor told him all the story. \"Yes,\" said Frank, \"I knew it all\nbefore. Dear Mary, dearest Mary! Don't you, doctor, teach yourself to\nbelieve that I shall forget her.\" And then also he went his way from\nhim--went his way also from Greshamsbury, and was absent for the full\nperiod of his allotted banishment--twelve months, namely, and a day.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\nThe Small End of the Wedge\n\n\nFrank Gresham was absent from Greshamsbury twelve months and a day: a\nday is always added to the period of such absences, as shown in the\nhistory of Lord Bateman and other noble heroes. We need not detail\nall the circumstances of his banishment, all the details of the\ncompact that was made. One detail of course was this, that there\nshould be no corresponding; a point to which the squire found some\ndifficulty in bringing his son to assent.\n\nIt must not be supposed that Mary Thorne or the doctor were in any\nway parties to, or privy to these agreements. By no means. The\nagreements were drawn out, and made, and signed, and sealed at\nGreshamsbury, and were known of nowhere else. The reader must not\nimagine that Lady Arabella was prepared to give up her son, if\nonly his love could remain constant for one year. Neither did Lady\nArabella consent to any such arrangement, nor did the squire. It was\nsettled rather in this wise: that Frank should be subjected to no\ntorturing process, pestered to give no promises, should in no way be\nbullied about Mary--that is, not at present--if he would go away for\na year. Then, at the end of the year, the matter should again be\ndiscussed. Agreeing to this, Frank took his departure, and was absent\nas per agreement.\n\nWhat were Mary's fortunes immediately after his departure must be\nshortly told, and then we will again join some of our Greshamsbury\nfriends at a period about a month before Frank's return.\n\nWhen Sir Louis saw Frank Gresham standing by Mary's donkey, with\nhis arms round Mary's knees, he began to fear that there must be\nsomething in it. He had intended that very day to throw himself\nat Mary's feet, and now it appeared to his inexperienced eyes as\nthough somebody else had been at the same work before him. This not\nunnaturally made him cross; so, after having sullenly wished the\nvisitor good-bye, he betook himself to his room, and there drank\ncura\u00c3\u00a7oa alone, instead of coming down to dinner.\n\nThis he did for two or three days, and then, taking heart of grace,\nhe remembered that, after all, he had very many advantages over young\nGresham. In the first place, he was a baronet, and could make his\nwife a \"lady.\" In the next place, Frank's father was alive and like\nto live, whereas his own was dead. He possessed Boxall Hill in his\nown right, but his rival had neither house nor land of his own. After\nall, might it not be possible for him also to put his arm round\nMary's knees;--her knees, or her waist, or, perhaps, even her neck?\nFaint heart never won fair lady. At any rate, he would try.\n\nAnd he did try. With what result, as regards Mary, need hardly be\ntold. He certainly did not get nearly so far as putting his hand even\nupon her knee before he was made to understand that it \"was no go,\"\nas he graphically described it to his mother. He tried once and\nagain. On the first time Mary was very civil, though very determined.\nOn the second, she was more determined, though less civil; and then\nshe told him, that if he pressed her further he would drive her from\nhis mother's house. There was something then about Mary's eye, a\nfixed composure round her mouth, and an authority in her face, which\nwent far to quell him; and he did not press her again.\n\nHe immediately left Boxall Hill, and, returning to London, had more\nviolent recourse to the cura\u00c3\u00a7oa. It was not long before the doctor\nheard of him, and was obliged to follow him, and then again occurred\nthose frightful scenes in which the poor wretch had to expiate,\neither in terrible delirium or more terrible prostration of spirits,\nthe vile sin which his father had so early taught him.\n\nThen Mary returned to her uncle's home. Frank was gone, and she\ntherefore could resume her place at Greshamsbury. Yes, she came back\nto Greshamsbury; but Greshamsbury was by no means the same place that\nit was formerly. Almost all intercourse was now over between the\ndoctor and the Greshamsbury people. He rarely ever saw the squire,\nand then only on business. Not that the squire had purposely\nquarrelled with him; but Dr Thorne himself had chosen that it should\nbe so, since Frank had openly proposed for his niece. Frank was now\ngone, and Lady Arabella was in arms against him. It should not be\nsaid that he kept up any intimacy for the sake of aiding the lovers\nin their love. No one should rightfully accuse him of inveigling the\nheir to marry his niece.\n\nMary, therefore, found herself utterly separated from Beatrice. She\nwas not even able to learn what Beatrice would think, or did think,\nof the engagement as it now stood. She could not even explain to\nher friend that love had been too strong for her, and endeavour to\nget some comfort from that friend's absolution from her sin. This\nestrangement was now carried so far that she and Beatrice did not\neven meet on neutral ground. Lady Arabella made it known to Miss\nOriel that her daughter could not meet Mary Thorne, even as strangers\nmeet; and it was made known to others also. Mrs Yates Umbleby, and\nher dear friend Miss Gushing, to whose charming tea-parties none of\nthe Greshamsbury ladies went above once in a twelvemonth, talked\nthrough the parish of this distressing difficulty. They would have\nbeen so happy to have asked dear Mary Thorne, only the Greshamsbury\nladies did not approve.\n\nMary was thus tabooed from all society in the place in which a\ntwelvemonth since she had been, of all its denizens, perhaps the\nmost courted. In those days, no bevy of Greshamsbury young ladies\nhad fairly represented the Greshamsbury young ladyhood if Mary\nThorne was not there. Now she was excluded from all such bevies.\nPatience did not quarrel with her, certainly;--came to see her\nfrequently;--invited her to walk;--invited her frequently to the\nparsonage. But Mary was shy of acceding to such invitations, and at\nlast frankly told her friend Patience, that she would not again break\nbread in Greshamsbury in any house in which she was not thought fit\nto meet the other guests who habitually resorted there.\n\nIn truth, both the doctor and his niece were very sore, but they\nwere of that temperament that keeps all its soreness to itself. Mary\nwalked out by herself boldly, looking at least as though she were\nindifferent to all the world. She was, indeed, hardly treated. Young\nladies' engagements are generally matters of profoundest secrecy, and\nare hardly known of by their near friends till marriage is a thing\nsettled. But all the world knew of Mary's engagement within a month\nof that day on which she had neglected to expel Frank's finger from\nher hand; it had been told openly through the country-side that she\nhad confessed her love for the young squire. Now it is disagreeable\nfor a young lady to walk about under such circumstances, especially\nso when she has no female friend to keep her in countenance,\nmore especially so when the gentleman is of such importance in the\nneighbourhood as Frank was in that locality. It was a matter of\nmoment to every farmer, and every farmer's wife, which bride Frank\nshould marry of those bespoken for him; Mary, namely, or Money. Every\nyokel about the place had been made to understand that, by some\nfeminine sleight of hand, the doctor's niece had managed to trap\nMaster Frank, and that Master Frank had been sent out of the way so\nthat he might, if yet possible, break through the trapping. All this\nmade life rather unpleasant for her.\n\nOne day, walking solitary in the lanes, she met that sturdy farmer to\nwhose daughter she had in former days been so serviceable. \"God bless\n'ee, Miss Mary,\" said he--he always did bid God bless her when he saw\nher. \"And, Miss Mary, to say my mind out freely, thee be quite gude\nenough for un, quite gude enough; so thee be'st tho'f he were ten\nsquoires.\" There may, perhaps, have been something pleasant in the\nheartiness of this; but it was not pleasant to have this heart affair\nof hers thus publicly scanned and talked over: to have it known to\nevery one that she had set her heart on marrying Frank Gresham, and\nthat all the Greshams had set their hearts on preventing it. And yet\nshe could in nowise help it. No girl could have been more staid and\ndemure, less demonstrative and boastful about her love. She had never\nyet spoken freely, out of her full heart, to one human being. \"Oh,\nFrank!\" All her spoken sin had been contained in that.\n\nBut Lady Arabella had been very active. It suited her better that it\nshould be known, far and wide, that a nameless pauper--Lady Arabella\nonly surmised that her foe was nameless; but she did not scruple to\ndeclare it--was intriguing to catch the heir of Greshamsbury. None of\nthe Greshams must meet Mary Thorne; that was the edict sent about the\ncountry; and the edict was well understood. Those, therefore, were\nbad days for Miss Thorne.\n\nShe had never yet spoken on the matter freely, out of her full heart\nto one human being. Not to one? Not to him? Not to her uncle? No, not\neven to him, fully and freely. She had told him that that had passed\nbetween Frank and her which amounted, at any rate on his part, to a\nproposal.\n\n\"Well, dearest, and what was your answer?\" said her uncle, drawing\nher close to him, and speaking in his kindest voice.\n\n\"I hardly made any answer, uncle.\"\n\n\"You did not reject him, Mary?\"\n\n\"No, uncle,\" and then she paused;--he had never known her tremble as\nshe now trembled. \"But if you say that I ought, I will,\" she added,\ndrawing every word from herself with difficulty.\n\n\"I say you ought, Mary! Nay; but this question you must answer\nyourself.\"\n\n\"Must I?\" said she, plaintively. And then she sat for the next\nhalf hour with her head against his shoulder; but nothing more was\nsaid about it. They both acquiesced in the sentence that had been\npronounced against them, and went on together more lovingly than\nbefore.\n\nThe doctor was quite as weak as his niece; nay, weaker. She hesitated\nfearfully as to what she ought to do: whether she should obey her\nheart or the dictates of Greshamsbury. But he had other doubts than\nhers, which nearly set him wild when he strove to bring his mind to\na decision. He himself was now in possession--of course as a trustee\nonly--of the title-deeds of the estate; more of the estate, much\nmore, belonged to the heirs under Sir Roger Scatcherd's will than to\nthe squire. It was now more than probable that that heir must be Mary\nThorne. His conviction became stronger and stronger that no human\nefforts would keep Sir Louis in the land of the living till he\nwas twenty-five. Could he, therefore, wisely or honestly, in true\nfriendship to the squire, to Frank, or to his niece, take any steps\nto separate two persons who loved each other, and whose marriage\nwould in all human probability be so suitable?\n\nAnd yet he could not bring himself to encourage it then. The idea\nof \"looking after dead men's shoes\" was abhorrent to his mind,\nespecially when the man whose death he contemplated had been so\ntrusted to him as had been Sir Louis Scatcherd. He could not speak\nof the event, even to the squire, as being possible. So he kept his\npeace from day to day, and gave no counsel to Mary in the matter.\n\nAnd then he had his own individual annoyances, and very aggravating\nannoyances they were. The carriage--or rather post-chaise--of Dr\nFillgrave was now frequent in Greshamsbury, passing him constantly\nin the street, among the lanes, and on the high roads. It seemed as\nthough Dr Fillgrave could never get to his patients at the big house\nwithout showing himself to his beaten rival, either on his way\nthither or on his return. This alone would, perhaps, not have hurt\nthe doctor much; but it did hurt him to know that Dr Fillgrave was\nattending the squire for a little incipient gout, and that dear Nina\nwas in measles under those unloving hands.\n\nAnd then, also, the old-fashioned phaeton, of old-fashioned old\nDr Century was seen to rumble up to the big house, and it became\nknown that Lady Arabella was not very well. \"Not very well,\" when\npronounced in a low, grave voice about Lady Arabella, always meant\nsomething serious. And, in this case, something serious was meant.\nLady Arabella was not only ill, but frightened. It appeared, even to\nher, that Dr Fillgrave himself hardly knew what he was about, that he\nwas not so sure in his opinion, so confident in himself, as Dr Thorne\nused to be. How should he be, seeing that Dr Thorne had medically had\nLady Arabella in his hands for the last ten years?\n\nIf sitting with dignity in his hired carriage, and stepping with\nauthority up the big front steps, would have done anything, Dr\nFillgrave might have done much. Lady Arabella was greatly taken with\nhis looks when he first came to her, and it was only when she by\ndegrees perceived that the symptoms, which she knew so well, did not\nyield to him that she began to doubt those looks.\n\nAfter a while Dr Fillgrave himself suggested Dr Century. \"Not that\nI fear anything, Lady Arabella,\" said he,--lying hugely, for he did\nfear; fear both for himself and for her. \"But Dr Century has great\nexperience, and in such a matter, when the interests are so\nimportant, one cannot be too safe.\"\n\nSo Dr Century came and toddled slowly into her ladyship's room. He\ndid not say much; he left the talking to his learned brother, who\ncertainly was able to do that part of the business. But Dr Century,\nthough he said very little, looked very grave, and by no means\nquieted Lady Arabella's mind. She, as she saw the two putting their\nheads together, already had misgivings that she had done wrong. She\nknew that she could not be safe without Dr Thorne at her bedside, and\nshe already felt that she had exercised a most injudicious courage in\ndriving him away.\n\n\"Well, doctor?\" said she, as soon as Dr Century had toddled\ndownstairs to see the squire.\n\n\"Oh! we shall be all right, Lady Arabella; all right, very soon. But\nwe must be careful, very careful; I am glad I've had Century here,\nvery; but there's nothing to alter; little or nothing.\"\n\nThere were but few words spoken between Dr Century and the squire;\nbut few as they were, they frightened Mr Gresham. When Dr Fillgrave\ncame down the grand stairs, a servant waited at the bottom to ask him\nalso to go to the squire. Now there never had been much cordiality\nbetween the squire and Dr Fillgrave, though Mr Gresham had consented\nto take a preventative pill from his hands, and the little man\ntherefore swelled himself out somewhat more than ordinarily as he\nfollowed the servant.\n\n\"Dr Fillgrave,\" said the squire, at once beginning the conversation,\n\"Lady Arabella, is, I fear, in danger?\"\n\n\"Well, no; I hope not in danger, Mr Gresham. I certainly believe I\nmay be justified in expressing a hope that she is not in danger. Her\nstate is, no doubt, rather serious--rather serious--as Dr Century has\nprobably told you;\" and Dr Fillgrave made a bow to the old man, who\nsat quiet in one of the dining-room arm-chairs.\n\n\"Well, doctor,\" said the squire, \"I have not any grounds on which to\ndoubt your judgement.\"\n\nDr Fillgrave bowed, but with the stiffest, slightest inclination\nwhich a head could possibly make. He rather thought that Mr Gresham\nhad no ground for doubting his judgement.\n\n\"Nor do I.\"\n\nThe doctor bowed, and a little, a very little less stiffly.\n\n\"But, doctor, I think that something ought to be done.\"\n\nThe doctor this time did his bowing merely with his eyes and mouth.\nThe former he closed for a moment, the latter he pressed; and then\ndecorously rubbed his hands one over the other.\n\n\"I am afraid, Dr Fillgrave, that you and my friend Thorne are not the\nbest friends in the world.\"\n\n\"No, Mr Gresham, no; I may go so far as to say we are not.\"\n\n\"Well, I am sorry for it--\"\n\n\"Perhaps, Mr Gresham, we need hardly discuss it; but there have been\ncircumstances--\"\n\n\"I am not going to discuss anything, Dr Fillgrave; I say I am sorry\nfor it, because I believe that prudence will imperatively require\nLady Arabella to have Doctor Thorne back again. Now, if you would not\nobject to meet him--\"\n\n\"Mr Gresham, I beg pardon; I beg pardon, indeed; but you must really\nexcuse me. Doctor Thorne has, in my estimation--\"\n\n\"But, Doctor Fillgrave--\"\n\n\"Mr Gresham, you really must excuse me; you really must, indeed.\nAnything else that I could do for Lady Arabella, I should be most\nhappy to do; but after what has passed, I cannot meet Doctor Thorne;\nI really cannot. You must not ask me to do so; Mr Gresham. And, Mr\nGresham,\" continued the doctor, \"I did understand from Lady Arabella\nthat his--that is, Dr Thorne's--conduct to her ladyship had been\nsuch--so very outrageous, I may say, that--that--that--of course, Mr\nGresham, you know best; but I did think that Lady Arabella herself\nwas quite unwilling to see Doctor Thorne again;\" and Dr Fillgrave\nlooked very big, and very dignified, and very exclusive.\n\nThe squire did not ask again. He had no warrant for supposing that\nLady Arabella would receive Dr Thorne if he did come; and he saw\nthat it was useless to attempt to overcome the rancour of a man so\npig-headed as the little Galen now before him. Other propositions\nwere then broached, and it was at last decided that assistance should\nbe sought for from London, in the person of the great Sir Omicron\nPie.\n\nSir Omicron came, and Drs Fillgrave and Century were there to meet\nhim. When they all assembled in Lady Arabella's room, the poor\nwoman's heart almost sank within her,--as well it might, at such\na sight. If she could only reconcile it with her honour, her\nconsistency, with her high de Courcy principles, to send once more\nfor Dr Thorne. Oh, Frank! Frank! to what misery your disobedience\nbrought your mother!\n\nSir Omicron and the lesser provincial lights had their consultation,\nand the lesser lights went their way to Barchester and Silverbridge,\nleaving Sir Omicron to enjoy the hospitality of Greshamsbury.\n\n\"You should have Thorne back here, Mr Gresham,\" said Sir Omicron,\nalmost in a whisper, when they were quite alone. \"Doctor Fillgrave\nis a very good man, and so is Dr Century; very good, I am sure. But\nThorne has known her ladyship so long.\" And then, on the following\nmorning, Sir Omicron also went his way.\n\nAnd then there was a scene between the squire and her ladyship. Lady\nArabella had given herself credit for great good generalship when she\nfound that the squire had been induced to take that pill. We have\nall heard of the little end of the wedge, and we have most of us an\nidea that the little end is the difficulty. That pill had been the\nlittle end of Lady Arabella's wedge. Up to that period she had been\nstruggling in vain to make a severance between her husband and her\nenemy. That pill should do the business. She well knew how to make\nthe most of it; to have it published in Greshamsbury that the squire\nhad put his gouty toe into Dr Fillgrave's hands; how to let it\nbe known--especially at that humble house in the corner of the\nstreet--that Fillgrave's prescriptions now ran current through the\nwhole establishment. Dr Thorne did hear of it, and did suffer. He had\nbeen a true friend to the squire, and he thought the squire should\nhave stood to him more staunchly.\n\n\"After all,\" said he himself, \"perhaps it's as well--perhaps it will\nbe best that I should leave this place altogether.\" And then he\nthought of Sir Roger and his will, and of Mary and her lover. And\nthen of Mary's birth, and of his own theoretical doctrines as to pure\nblood. And so his troubles multiplied, and he saw no present daylight\nthrough them.\n\nSuch had been the way in which Lady Arabella had got in the little\nend of the wedge. And she would have triumphed joyfully had not her\nincreased doubts and fears as to herself then come in to check her\ntriumph and destroy her joy. She had not yet confessed to any one\nher secret regret for the friend she had driven away. She hardly yet\nacknowledged to herself that she did regret him; but she was uneasy,\nfrightened, and in low spirits.\n\n\"My dear,\" said the squire, sitting down by her bedside, \"I want to\ntell you what Sir Omicron said as he went away.\"\n\n\"Well?\" said her ladyship, sitting up and looking frightened.\n\n\"I don't know how you may take it, Bell; but I think it very good\nnews:\" the squire never called his wife Bell, except when he wanted\nher to be on particularly good terms with him.\n\n\"Well?\" said she again. She was not over-anxious to be gracious, and\ndid not reciprocate his familiarity.\n\n\"Sir Omicron says that you should have Thorne back again, and upon my\nhonour, I cannot but agree with him. Now, Thorne is a clever man, a\nvery clever man; nobody denies that; and then, you know--\"\n\n\"Why did not Sir Omicron say that to me?\" said her ladyship, sharply,\nall her disposition in Dr Thorne's favour becoming wonderfully damped\nby her husband's advocacy.\n\n\"I suppose he thought it better to say it to me,\" said the squire,\nrather curtly.\n\n\"He should have spoken to myself,\" said Lady Arabella, who, though\nshe did not absolutely doubt her husband's word, gave him credit\nfor having induced and led on Sir Omicron to the uttering of this\nopinion. \"Doctor Thorne has behaved to me in so gross, so indecent a\nmanner! And then, as I understand, he is absolutely encouraging that\ngirl--\"\n\n\"Now, Bell, you are quite wrong--\"\n\n\"Of course I am; I always am quite wrong.\"\n\n\"Quite wrong in mixing up two things; Doctor Thorne as an\nacquaintance, and Dr Thorne as a doctor.\"\n\n\"It is dreadful to have him here, even standing in the room with me.\nHow can one talk to one's doctor openly and confidentially when one\nlooks upon him as one's worst enemy?\" And Lady Arabella, softening,\nalmost melted into tears.\n\n\"My dear, you cannot wonder that I should be anxious for you.\"\n\nLady Arabella gave a little snuffle, which might be taken as a not\nvery eloquent expression of thanks for the squire's solicitude, or as\nan ironical jeer at his want of sincerity.\n\n\"And, therefore, I have not lost a moment in telling you what Sir\nOmicron said. 'You should have Thorne back here;' those were his very\nwords. You can think it over, my dear. And remember this, Bell; if he\nis to do any good no time should be lost.\"\n\nAnd then the squire left the room, and Lady Arabella remained alone,\nperplexed by many doubts.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\nMr Oriel\n\n\nI must now, shortly--as shortly as it is in my power to do\nit--introduce a new character to my reader. Mention has been made\nof the rectory of Greshamsbury; but, hitherto, no opportunity has\noffered itself for the Rev Caleb Oriel to come upon the boards.\n\nMr Oriel was a man of family and fortune, who, having gone to Oxford\nwith the usual views of such men, had become inoculated there with\nvery High-Church principles, and had gone into orders influenced by a\nfeeling of enthusiastic love for the priesthood. He was by no means\nan ascetic--such men, indeed, seldom are--nor was he a devotee. He\nwas a man well able, and certainly willing, to do the work of a\nparish clergyman; and when he became one, he was efficacious in his\nprofession. But it may perhaps be said of him, without speaking\nslanderously, that his original calling, as a young man, was rather\nto the outward and visible signs of religion than to its inward and\nspiritual graces.\n\nHe delighted in lecterns and credence-tables, in services at dark\nhours of winter mornings when no one would attend, in high waistcoats\nand narrow white neckties, in chanted services and intoned prayers,\nand in all the paraphernalia of Anglican formalities which have given\nsuch offence to those of our brethren who live in daily fear of the\nscarlet lady. Many of his friends declared that Mr Oriel would sooner\nor later deliver himself over body and soul to that lady; but there\nwas no need to fear for him: for though sufficiently enthusiastic to\nget out of bed at five a.m. on winter mornings--he did so, at least,\nall through his first winter at Greshamsbury--he was not made of\nthat stuff which is necessary for a staunch, burning, self-denying\nconvert. It was not in him to change his very sleek black coat for a\nCapuchin's filthy cassock, nor his pleasant parsonage for some dirty\nhole in Rome. And it was better so both for him and others. There are\nbut few, very few, to whom it is given to be a Huss, a Wickliffe,\nor a Luther; and a man gains but little by being a false Huss, or a\nfalse Luther,--and his neighbours gain less.\n\nBut certain lengths in self-privation Mr Oriel did go; at any rate,\nfor some time. He eschewed matrimony, imagining that it became him\nas a priest to do so. He fasted rigorously on Fridays; and the\nneighbours declared that he scourged himself.\n\nMr Oriel was, as it has been said, a man of fortune; that is to say,\nwhen he came of age he was master of thirty thousand pounds. When he\ntook it into his head to go into the Church, his friends bought for\nhim the next presentation to the living at Greshamsbury; and, a year\nafter his ordination, the living falling in, Mr Oriel brought himself\nand his sister to the rectory.\n\nMr Oriel soon became popular. He was a dark-haired, good-looking\nman, of polished manners, agreeable in society, not given to monkish\nausterities--except in the matter of Fridays--nor yet to the\nLow-Church severity of demeanour. He was thoroughly a gentleman,\ngood-humoured, inoffensive, and sociable. But he had one fault: he\nwas not a marrying man.\n\nOn this ground there was a feeling against him so strong as almost at\none time to throw him into serious danger. It was not only that he\nshould be sworn against matrimony in his individual self--he whom\nfate had made so able to sustain the weight of a wife and family;\nbut what an example he was setting! If other clergymen all around\nshould declare against wives and families, what was to become of the\ncountry? What was to be done in the rural districts? The religious\nobservances, as regards women, of a Brigham Young were hardly so bad\nas this!\n\nThere were around Greshamsbury very many unmarried ladies--I believe\nthere generally are so round most such villages. From the great house\nhe did not receive much annoyance. Beatrice was then only just on the\nverge of being brought out, and was not perhaps inclined to think\nvery much of a young clergyman; and Augusta certainly intended to fly\nat higher game. But there were the Miss Athelings, the daughters of\na neighbouring clergyman, who were ready to go all lengths with him\nin High-Church matters, except as that one tremendously papal step\nof celibacy; and the two Miss Hesterwells, of Hesterwell Park, the\nyounger of whom boldly declared her purpose of civilising the savage;\nand Mrs Opie Green, a very pretty widow, with a very pretty jointure,\nwho lived in a very pretty house about a mile from Greshamsbury, and\nwho declared her opinion that Mr Oriel was quite right in his view of\na clergyman's position. How could a woman, situated as she was, have\nthe comfort of a clergyman's attention if he were to be regarded\njust as any other man? She could now know in what light to regard\nMr Oriel, and would be able without scruple to avail herself of his\nzeal. So she did avail herself of his zeal,--and that without any\nscruple.\n\nAnd then there was Miss Gushing,--a young thing. Miss Gushing had a\ngreat advantage over the other competitors for the civilisation of\nMr Oriel, namely, in this--that she was able to attend his morning\nservices. If Mr Oriel was to be reached in any way, it was probable\nthat he might be reached in this way. If anything could civilise\nhim, this would do it. Therefore, the young thing, through all one\nlong, tedious winter, tore herself from her warm bed, and was to\nbe seen--no, not seen, but heard--entering Mr Oriel's church at\nsix o'clock. With indefatigable assiduity the responses were made,\nuttered from under a close bonnet, and out of a dark corner, in an\nenthusiastically feminine voice, through the whole winter.\n\nNor did Miss Gushing altogether fail in her object. When a\nclergyman's daily audience consists of but one person, and that\nperson is a young lady, it is hardly possible that he should not\nbecome personally intimate with her; hardly possible that he should\nnot be in some measure grateful. Miss Gushing's responses came from\nher with such fervour, and she begged for ghostly advice with such\neager longing to have her scruples satisfied, that Mr Oriel had\nnothing for it but to give way to a certain amount of civilisation.\n\nBy degrees it came to pass that Miss Gushing could never get her\nfinal prayer said, her shawl and boa adjusted, and stow away her\nnice new Prayer-Book with the red letters inside, and the cross on\nthe back, till Mr Oriel had been into his vestry and got rid of\nhis surplice. And then they met at the church-porch, and naturally\nwalked together till Mr Oriel's cruel gateway separated them. The\nyoung thing did sometimes think that, as the parson's civilisation\nprogressed, he might have taken the trouble to walk with her as far\nas Mr Yates Umbleby's hall door; but she had hope to sustain her, and\na firm resolve to merit success, even though she might not attain it.\n\n\"Is it not ten thousand pities,\" she once said to him, \"that none\nhere should avail themselves of the inestimable privilege which your\ncoming has conferred upon us? Oh, Mr Oriel, I do so wonder at it! To\nme it is so delightful! The morning service in the dark church is so\nbeautiful, so touching!\"\n\n\"I suppose they think it is a bore getting up so early,\" said Mr\nOriel.\n\n\"Ah, a bore!\" said Miss Gushing, in an enthusiastic tone of\ndepreciation. \"How insensate they must be! To me it gives a new charm\nto life. It quiets one for the day; makes one so much fitter for\none's daily trials and daily troubles. Does it not, Mr Oriel?\"\n\n\"I look upon morning prayer as an imperative duty, certainly.\"\n\n\"Oh, certainly, a most imperative duty; but so delicious at the same\ntime. I spoke to Mrs Umbleby about it, but she said she could not\nleave the children.\"\n\n\"No: I dare say not,\" said Mr Oriel.\n\n\"And Mr Umbleby said his business kept him up so late at night.\"\n\n\"Very probably. I hardly expect the attendance of men of business.\"\n\n\"But the servants might come, mightn't they, Mr Oriel?\"\n\n\"I fear that servants seldom can have time for daily prayers in\nchurch.\"\n\n\"Oh, ah, no; perhaps not.\" And then Miss Gushing began to bethink\nherself of whom should be composed the congregation which it must be\npresumed that Mr Oriel wished to see around him. But on this matter\nhe did not enlighten her.\n\nThen Miss Gushing took to fasting on Fridays, and made some futile\nattempts to induce her priest to give her the comfort of confessional\nabsolution. But, unfortunately, the zeal of the master waxed cool\nas that of the pupil waxed hot; and, at last, when the young thing\nreturned to Greshamsbury from an autumn excursion which she had made\nwith Mrs Umbleby to Weston-super-Mare, she found that the delicious\nmorning services had died a natural death. Miss Gushing did not on\nthat account give up the game, but she was bound to fight with no\nparticular advantage in her favour.\n\nMiss Oriel, though a good Churchwoman, was by no means a convert to\nher brother's extremist views, and perhaps gave but scanty credit\nto the Gushings, Athelings, and Opie Greens for the sincerity of\ntheir religion. But, nevertheless, she and her brother were staunch\nfriends; and she still hoped to see the day when he might be induced\nto think that an English parson might get through his parish work\nwith the assistance of a wife better than he could do without such\nfeminine encumbrance. The girl whom she selected for his bride was\nnot the young thing, but Beatrice Gresham.\n\nAnd at last it seemed probable to Mr Oriel's nearest friends that he\nwas in a fair way to be overcome. Not that he had begun to make love\nto Beatrice, or committed himself by the utterance of any opinion as\nto the propriety of clerical marriages; but he daily became looser\nabout his peculiar tenets, raved less immoderately than heretofore as\nto the atrocity of the Greshamsbury church pews, and was observed to\ntake some opportunities of conversing alone with Beatrice. Beatrice\nhad always denied the imputation--this had usually been made by Mary\nin their happy days--with vehement asseverations of anger; and Miss\nGushing had tittered, and expressed herself as supposing that great\npeople's daughters might be as barefaced as they pleased.\n\nAll this had happened previous to the great Greshamsbury feud. Mr\nOriel gradually got himself into a way of sauntering up to the great\nhouse, sauntering into the drawing-room for the purpose, as I am sure\nhe thought, of talking to Lady Arabella, and then of sauntering home\nagain, having usually found an opportunity for saying a few words to\nBeatrice during the visit. This went on all through the feud up to\nthe period of Lady Arabella's illness; and then one morning, about\na month before the date fixed for Frank's return, Mr Oriel found\nhimself engaged to Miss Beatrice Gresham.\n\nFrom the day that Miss Gushing heard of it--which was not however\nfor some considerable time after this--she became an Independent\nMethodist. She could no longer, she said at first, have any faith in\nany religion; and for an hour or so she was almost tempted to swear\nthat she could no longer have any faith in any man. She had nearly\ncompleted a worked cover for a credence-table when the news reached\nher, as to which, in the young enthusiasm of her heart, she had not\nbeen able to remain silent; it had already been promised to Mr Oriel;\nthat promise she swore should not be kept. He was an apostate, she\nsaid, from his principles; an utter pervert; a false, designing man,\nwith whom she would never have trusted herself alone on dark mornings\nhad she known that he had such grovelling, worldly inclinations. So\nMiss Gushing became an Independent Methodist; the credence-table\ncovering was cut up into slippers for the preacher's feet; and the\nyoung thing herself, more happy in this direction than she had been\nin the other, became the arbiter of that preacher's domestic\nhappiness.\n\nBut this little history of Miss Gushing's future life is premature.\nMr Oriel became engaged demurely, nay, almost silently, to Beatrice,\nand no one out of their own immediate families was at the time\ninformed of the matter. It was arranged very differently from those\ntwo other matches--embryo, or not embryo, those, namely, of Augusta\nwith Mr Moffat, and Frank with Mary Thorne. All Barsetshire had heard\nof them; but that of Beatrice and Mr Oriel was managed in a much more\nprivate manner.\n\n\"I do think you are a happy girl,\" said Patience to her one morning.\n\n\"Indeed I am.\"\n\n\"He is so good. You don't know how good he is as yet; he never thinks\nof himself, and thinks so much of those he loves.\"\n\nBeatrice took her friend's hand in her own and kissed it. She was\nfull of joy. When a girl is about to be married, when she may\nlawfully talk of her love, there is no music in her ears so sweet as\nthe praises of her lover.\n\n\"I made up my mind from the first that he should marry you.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, Patience.\"\n\n\"I did, indeed. I made up my mind that he should marry; and there\nwere only two to choose from.\"\n\n\"Me and Miss Gushing,\" said Beatrice, laughing.\n\n\"No; not exactly Miss Gushing. I had not many fears for Caleb there.\"\n\n\"I declare she's very pretty,\" said Beatrice, who could afford to be\ngood-natured. Now Miss Gushing certainly was pretty; and would have\nbeen very pretty had her nose not turned up so much, and could she\nhave parted her hair in the centre.\n\n\"Well, I am very glad you chose me;--if it was you who chose,\" said\nBeatrice, modestly; having, however, in her own mind a strong opinion\nthat Mr Oriel had chosen for himself, and had never had any doubt in\nthe matter. \"And who was the other?\"\n\n\"Can't you guess?\"\n\n\"I won't guess any more; perhaps Mrs Green.\"\n\n\"Oh, no; certainly not a widow. I don't like widows marrying. But of\ncourse you could guess if you would; of course it was Mary Thorne.\nBut I soon saw Mary would not do, for two reasons; Caleb would never\nhave liked her well enough nor would she ever have liked him.\"\n\n\"Not like him! oh I hope she will; I do so love Mary Thorne.\"\n\n\"So do I, dearly; and so does Caleb; but he could never have loved\nher as he loves you.\"\n\n\"But, Patience, have you told Mary?\"\n\n\"No, I have told no one, and shall not without your leave.\"\n\n\"Ah, you must tell her. Tell it her with my best, and kindest,\nwarmest love. Tell her how happy I am, and how I long to talk to\nher. Tell that I will have her for my bridesmaid. Oh! I do hope that\nbefore that all this horrid quarrel will be settled.\"\n\nPatience undertook the commission, and did tell Mary; did give her\nalso the message which Beatrice had sent. And Mary was rejoiced to\nhear it; for though, as Patience had said of her, she had never\nherself felt any inclination to fall in love with Mr Oriel, she\nbelieved him to be one in whose hands her friend's happiness would be\nsecure. Then, by degrees, the conversation changed from the loves of\nMr Oriel and Beatrice to the troubles of Frank Gresham and herself.\n\n\"She says, that let what will happen you shall be one of her\nbridesmaids.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes, dear Trichy! that was settled between us in auld lang syne;\nbut those settlements are all unsettled now, must all be broken. No,\nI cannot be her bridesmaid; but I shall yet hope to see her once\nbefore her marriage.\"\n\n\"And why not be her bridesmaid? Lady Arabella will hardly object to\nthat.\"\n\n\"Lady Arabella!\" said Mary, curling her lip with deep scorn. \"I do\nnot care that for Lady Arabella,\" and she let her silver thimble fall\nfrom her fingers on to the table. \"If Beatrice invited me to her\nwedding, she might manage as to that; I should ask no question as to\nLady Arabella.\"\n\n\"Then why not come to it?\"\n\nShe remained silent for a while, and then boldly answered. \"Though I\ndo not care for Lady Arabella, I do care for Mr Gresham:--and I do\ncare for his son.\"\n\n\"But the squire always loved you.\"\n\n\"Yes, and therefore I will not be there to vex his sight. I will tell\nyou the truth, Patience. I can never be in that house again till\nFrank Gresham is a married man, or till I am about to be a married\nwoman. I do not think they have treated me well, but I will not treat\nthem ill.\"\n\n\"I am sure you will not do that,\" said Miss Oriel.\n\n\"I will endeavour not to do so; and, therefore, will go to none of\ntheir f\u00c3\u00aates! No, Patience.\" And then she turned her head to the arm\nof the sofa, and silently, without audible sobs, hiding her face, she\nendeavoured to get rid of her tears unseen. For one moment she had\nall but resolved to pour out the whole truth of her love into her\nfriend's ears; but suddenly she changed her mind. Why should she talk\nof her own unhappiness? Why should she speak of her own love when she\nwas fully determined not to speak of Frank's promises.\n\n\"Mary, dear Mary.\"\n\n\"Anything but pity, Patience; anything but that,\" said she,\nconvulsively, swallowing down her sobs, and rubbing away her tears.\n\"I cannot bear that. Tell Beatrice from me, that I wish her every\nhappiness; and, with such a husband, I am sure she will be happy. I\nwish her every joy; give her my kindest love; but tell her I cannot\nbe at her marriage. Oh, I should so like to see her; not there, you\nknow, but here, in my own room, where I still have liberty to speak.\"\n\n\"But why should you decide now? She is not to be married yet, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"Now, or this day twelvemonth, can make no difference. I will not go\ninto that house again, unless--but never mind; I will not go into it\nall; never, never again. If I could forgive her for myself, I could\nnot forgive her for my uncle. But tell me, Patience, might not\nBeatrice now come here? It is so dreadful to see her every Sunday in\nchurch and never to speak to her, never to kiss her. She seems to\nlook away from me as though she too had chosen to quarrel with me.\"\n\nMiss Oriel promised to do her best. She could not imagine, she said,\nthat such a visit could be objected to on such an occasion. She would\nnot advise Beatrice to come without telling her mother; but she\ncould not think that Lady Arabella would be so cruel as to make any\nobjection, knowing, as she could not but know, that her daughter,\nwhen married, would be at liberty to choose her own friends.\n\n\"Good-bye, Mary,\" said Patience. \"I wish I knew how to say more to\ncomfort you.\"\n\n\"Oh, comfort! I don't want comfort. I want to be let alone.\"\n\n\"That's just it: you are so ferocious in your scorn, so unbending, so\ndetermined to take all the punishment that comes in your way.\"\n\n\"What I do take, I'll take without complaint,\" said Mary; and then\nthey kissed each other and parted.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\nA Morning Visit\n\n\nIt must be remembered that Mary, among her miseries, had to suffer\nthis: that since Frank's departure, now nearly twelve months ago, she\nhad not heard a word about him; or rather, she had only heard that he\nwas very much in love with some lady in London. This news reached her\nin a manner so circuitous, and from such a doubtful source; it seemed\nto her to savour so strongly of Lady Arabella's precautions, that\nshe attributed it at once to malice, and blew it to the winds. It\nmight not improbably be the case that Frank was untrue to her; but\nshe would not take it for granted because she was now told so. It\nwas more than probable that he should amuse himself with some one;\nflirting was his prevailing sin; and if he did flirt, the most would\nof course be made of it.\n\nBut she found it to be very desolate to be thus left alone without\na word of comfort or a word of love; without being able to speak to\nany one of what filled her heart; doubting, nay, more than doubting,\nbeing all but sure that her passion must terminate in misery. Why had\nshe not obeyed her conscience and her better instinct in that moment\nwhen the necessity for deciding had come upon her? Why had she\nallowed him to understand that he was master of her heart? Did she\nnot know that there was everything against such a marriage as that\nwhich he proposed? Had she not done wrong, very wrong, even to think\nof it? Had she not sinned deeply, against Mr Gresham, who had ever\nbeen so kind to her? Could she hope, was it possible, that a boy like\nFrank should be true to his first love? And, if he were true, if he\nwere ready to go to the altar with her to-morrow, ought she to allow\nhim to degrade himself by such a marriage?\n\nThere was, alas! some truth about the London lady. Frank had taken\nhis degree, as arranged, and had then gone abroad for the winter,\ndoing the fashionable things, going up the Nile, crossing over to\nMount Sinai, thence over the long desert to Jerusalem, and home by\nDamascus, Beyrout, and Constantinople, bringing back a long beard, a\nred cap, and a chibook, just as our fathers used to go through Italy\nand Switzerland, and our grandfathers to spend a season in Paris. He\nhad then remained for a couple of months in London, going through\nall the society which the de Courcys were able to open to him. And\nit was true that a certain belle of the season, of that season and\nsome others, had been captivated--for the tenth time--by the silken\nsheen of his long beard. Frank had probably been more demonstrative,\nperhaps even more susceptible, than he should have been; and\nhence the rumour, which had all too willingly been forwarded to\nGreshamsbury.\n\nBut young Gresham had also met another lady in London, namely Miss\nDunstable. Mary would indeed have been grateful to Miss Dunstable,\ncould she have known all that lady did for her. Frank's love was\nnever allowed to flag. When he spoke of the difficulties in his way,\nshe twitted him by being overcome by straws; and told him that no\none was worth having who was afraid of every lion that he met in his\npath. When he spoke of money, she bade him earn it; and always ended\nby offering to smooth for him any real difficulty which want of means\nmight put in his way.\n\n\"No,\" Frank used to say to himself, when these offers were made, \"I\nnever intended to take her and her money together; and, therefore, I\ncertainly will never take the money alone.\"\n\nA day or two after Miss Oriel's visit, Mary received the following\nnote from Beatrice.\n\n\n   DEAREST, DEAREST MARY,\n\n   I shall be so happy to see you, and will come to-morrow at\n   twelve. I have asked mamma, and she says that, for once,\n   she has no objection. You know it is not my fault that\n   I have never been with you; don't you? Frank comes home\n   on the 12th. Mr Oriel wants the wedding to be on the 1st\n   of September; but that seems to be so very, very soon;\n   doesn't it? However, mamma and papa are all on his side.\n   I won't write about this, though, for we shall have such a\n   delicious talk. Oh, Mary! I have been so unhappy without\n   you.\n\n   Ever your own affectionate,\n\n   TRICHY\n\n   Monday.\n\n\nThough Mary was delighted at the idea of once more having her friend\nin her arms, there was, nevertheless, something in this letter which\noppressed her. She could not put up with the idea that Beatrice\nshould have permission given to come to her--just for once. She\nhardly wished to be seen by permission. Nevertheless, she did not\nrefuse the proffered visit, and the first sight of Beatrice's face,\nthe first touch of the first embrace, dissipated for the moment all\nher anger.\n\nAnd then Beatrice fully enjoyed the delicious talk which she had\npromised herself. Mary let her have her way, and for two hours\nall the delights and all the duties, all the comforts and all the\nresponsibilities of a parson's wife were discussed with almost equal\nardour on both sides. The duties and responsibilities were not\nexactly those which too often fall to the lot of the mistress of\nan English vicarage. Beatrice was not doomed to make her husband\ncomfortable, to educate her children, dress herself like a lady, and\nexercise open-handed charity on an income of two hundred pounds a\nyear. Her duties and responsibilities would have to spread themselves\nover seven or eight times that amount of worldly burden. Living also\nclose to Greshamsbury, and not far from Courcy Castle, she would have\nthe full advantages and all the privileges of county society. In\nfact, it was all _couleur de rose_, and so she chatted deliciously\nwith her friend.\n\nBut it was impossible that they should separate without something\nhaving been said as to Mary's own lot. It would, perhaps, have been\nbetter that they should do so; but this was hardly within the compass\nof human nature.\n\n\"And Mary, you know, I shall be able to see you as often as I\nlike;--you and Dr Thorne, too, when I have a house of my own.\"\n\nMary said nothing, but essayed to smile. It was but a ghastly\nattempt.\n\n\"You know how happy that will make me,\" continued Beatrice. \"Of\ncourse mamma won't expect me to be led by her then: if he likes it,\nthere can be no objection; and he will like it, you may be sure of\nthat.\"\n\n\"You are very kind, Trichy,\" said Mary; but she spoke in a tone very\ndifferent from that she would have used eighteen months ago.\n\n\"Why, what is the matter, Mary? Shan't you be glad to come to see\nus?\"\n\n\"I do not know, dearest; that must depend on circumstances. To see\nyou, you yourself, your own dear, sweet, loving face must always be\npleasant to me.\"\n\n\"And shan't you be glad to see him?\"\n\n\"Yes, certainly, if he loves you.\"\n\n\"Of course he loves me.\"\n\n\"All that alone would be pleasant enough, Trichy. But what if there\nshould be circumstances which should still make us enemies; should\nmake your friends and my friends--friend, I should say, for I have\nonly one--should make them opposed to each other?\"\n\n\"Circumstances! What circumstances?\"\n\n\"You are going to be married, Trichy, to the man you love; are you\nnot?\"\n\n\"Indeed, I am!\"\n\n\"And it is not pleasant? is it not a happy feeling?\"\n\n\"Pleasant! happy! yes, very pleasant; very happy. But, Mary, I am not\nat all in such a hurry as he is,\" said Beatrice, naturally thinking\nof her own little affairs.\n\n\"And, suppose I should wish to be married to the man that I love?\"\nMary said this slowly and gravely, and as she spoke she looked her\nfriend full in the face.\n\nBeatrice was somewhat astonished, and for the moment hardly\nunderstood. \"I am sure I hope you will, some day.\"\n\n\"No, Trichy; no, you hope the other way. I love your brother; I love\nFrank Gresham; I love him quite as well, quite as warmly, as you love\nCaleb Oriel.\"\n\n\"Do you?\" said Beatrice, staring with all her eyes, and giving one\nlong sigh, as this new subject for sorrow was so distinctly put\nbefore her.\n\n\"It that so odd?\" said Mary. \"You love Mr Oriel, though you have been\nintimate with him hardly more than two years. Is it so odd that I\nshould love your brother, whom I have known almost all my life?\"\n\n\"But, Mary, I thought it was always understood between us\nthat--that--I mean that you were not to care about him; not in the\nway of loving him, you know--I thought you always said so--I have\nalways told mamma so as if it came from yourself.\"\n\n\"Beatrice, do not tell anything to Lady Arabella as though it came\nfrom me; I do not want anything to be told to her, either of me or\nfrom me. Say what you like to me yourself; whatever you say will not\nanger me. Indeed, I know what you would say--and yet I love you. Oh,\nI love you, Trichy--Trichy, I do love you so much! Don't turn away\nfrom me!\"\n\nThere was such a mixture in Mary's manner of tenderness and almost\nferocity, that poor Beatrice could hardly follow her. \"Turn away from\nyou, Mary! no never; but this does make me unhappy.\"\n\n\"It is better that you should know it all, and then you will not be\nled into fighting my battles again. You cannot fight them so that I\nshould win; I do love your brother; love him truly, fondly, tenderly.\nI would wish to have him for my husband as you wish to have Mr\nOriel.\"\n\n\"But, Mary, you cannot marry him!\"\n\n\"Why not?\" said she, in a loud voice. \"Why can I not marry him? If\nthe priest says a blessing over us, shall we not be married as well\nas you and your husband?\"\n\n\"But you know he cannot marry unless his wife shall have money.\"\n\n\"Money--money; and he is to sell himself for money? Oh, Trichy! do\nnot you talk about money. It is horrible. But, Trichy, I will grant\nit--I cannot marry him; but still, I love him. He has a name, a place\nin the world, and fortune, family, high blood, position, everything.\nHe has all this, and I have nothing. Of course I cannot marry him.\nBut yet I do love him.\"\n\n\"Are you engaged to him, Mary?\"\n\n\"He is not engaged to me; but I am to him.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mary, that is impossible!\"\n\n\"It is not impossible: it is the case--I am pledged to him; but he is\nnot pledged to me.\"\n\n\"But, Mary, don't look at me in that way. I do not quite understand\nyou. What is the good of your being engaged if you cannot marry him?\"\n\n\"Good! there is no good. But can I help it, if I love him? Can I make\nmyself not love him by just wishing it? Oh, I would do it if I could.\nBut now you will understand why I shake my head when you talk of my\ncoming to your house. Your ways and my ways must be different.\"\n\nBeatrice was startled, and, for a time, silenced. What Mary said of\nthe difference of their ways was quite true. Beatrice had dearly\nloved her friend, and had thought of her with affection through all\nthis long period in which they had been separated; but she had given\nher love and her thoughts on the understanding, as it were, that they\nwere in unison as to the impropriety of Frank's conduct.\n\nShe had always spoken, with a grave face, of Frank and his love as of\na great misfortune, even to Mary herself; and her pity for Mary had\nbeen founded on the conviction of her innocence. Now all those ideas\nhad to be altered. Mary owned her fault, confessed herself to be\nguilty of all that Lady Arabella so frequently laid to her charge,\nand confessed herself anxious to commit every crime as to which\nBeatrice had been ever so ready to defend her.\n\nHad Beatrice up to this dreamed that Mary was in love with Frank,\nshe would doubtless have sympathised with her more or less, sooner\nor later. As it was, it was beyond all doubt that she would soon\nsympathise with her. But, at the moment, the suddenness of the\ndeclaration seemed to harden her heart, and she forgot, as it were,\nto speak tenderly to her friend.\n\nShe was silent, therefore, and dismayed; and looked as though she\nthought that her ways and Mary's ways must be different.\n\nMary saw all that was passing in the other's mind: no, not all; all\nthe hostility, the disappointment, the disapproval, the unhappiness,\nshe did see; but not the under-current of love, which was strong\nenough to well up and drown all these, if only time could be allowed\nfor it to do so.\n\n\"I am glad I have told you,\" said Mary, curbing herself, \"for deceit\nand hypocrisy are detestable.\"\n\n\"It was a misunderstanding, not deceit,\" said Beatrice.\n\n\"Well, now we understand each other; now you know that I have a heart\nwithin me, which like those of some others has not always been under\nmy own control. Lady Arabella believes that I am intriguing to be the\nmistress of Greshamsbury. You, at any rate, will not think that of\nme. If it could be discovered to-morrow that Frank were not the heir,\nI might have some chance of happiness.\"\n\n\"But, Mary--\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"You say you love him.\"\n\n\"Yes; I do say so.\"\n\n\"But if he does not love you, will you cease to do so?\"\n\n\"If I have a fever, I will get rid of it if I can; in such case I\nmust do so, or die.\"\n\n\"I fear,\" continued Beatrice, \"you hardly know, perhaps do not think,\nwhat is Frank's real character. He is not made to settle down early\nin life; even now, I believe he is attached to some lady in London,\nwhom, of course, he cannot marry.\"\n\nBeatrice said this in perfect trueness of heart. She had heard of\nFrank's new love-affair, and believing what she had heard, thought\nit best to tell the truth. But the information was not of a kind to\nquiet Mary's spirit.\n\n\"Very well,\" said she, \"let it be so. I have nothing to say against\nit.\"\n\n\"But are you not preparing wretchedness and unhappiness for\nyourself?\"\n\n\"Very likely.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mary, do not be so cold with me! you know how delighted I should\nbe to have you for a sister-in-law, if only it were possible.\"\n\n\"Yes, Trichy; but it is impossible, is it not? Impossible that\nFrancis Gresham of Greshamsbury should disgrace himself by marrying\nsuch a poor creature as I am. Of course, I know it; of course, I am\nprepared for unhappiness and misery. He can amuse himself as he likes\nwith me or others--with anybody. It is his privilege. It is quite\nenough to say that he is not made for settling down. I know my own\nposition;--and yet I love him.\"\n\n\"But, Mary, has he asked you to be his wife? If so--\"\n\n\"You ask home-questions, Beatrice. Let me ask you one; has he ever\ntold you that he has done so?\"\n\nAt this moment Beatrice was not disposed to repeat all that Frank had\nsaid. A year ago, before he went away, he had told his sister a score\nof times that he meant to marry Mary Thorne if she would have him;\nbut Beatrice now looked on all that as idle, boyish vapouring. The\npity was, that Mary should have looked on it differently.\n\n\"We will each keep our secret,\" said Mary. \"Only remember this:\nshould Frank marry to-morrow, I shall have no ground for blaming him.\nHe is free as far I as am concerned. He can take the London lady if\nhe likes. You may tell him so from me. But, Trichy, what else I have\ntold you, I have told you only.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes!\" said Beatrice, sadly; \"I shall say nothing of it to\nanybody. It is very sad, very, very; I was so happy when I came here,\nand now I am so wretched.\" This was the end of that delicious talk to\nwhich she had looked forward with so much eagerness.\n\n\"Don't be wretched about me, dearest; I shall get through it. I\nsometimes think I was born to be unhappy, and that unhappiness agrees\nwith me best. Kiss me now, Trichy, and don't be wretched any more.\nYou owe it to Mr Oriel to be as happy as the day is long.\"\n\nAnd then they parted.\n\nBeatrice, as she went out, saw Dr Thorne in his little shop on the\nright-hand side of the passage, deeply engaged in some derogatory\nbranch of an apothecary's mechanical trade; mixing a dose, perhaps,\nfor a little child. She would have passed him without speaking if she\ncould have been sure of doing so without notice, for her heart was\nfull, and her eyes were red with tears; but it was so long since she\nhad been in his house that she was more than ordinarily anxious not\nto appear uncourteous or unkind to him.\n\n\"Good morning, doctor,\" she said, changing her countenance as best\nshe might, and attempting a smile.\n\n\"Ah, my fairy!\" said he, leaving his villainous compounds, and coming\nout to her; \"and you, too, are about to become a steady old lady.\"\n\n\"Indeed, I am not, doctor; I don't mean to be either steady or old\nfor the next ten years. But who has told you? I suppose Mary has been\na traitor.\"\n\n\"Well, I will confess, Mary was the traitor. But hadn't I a right\nto be told, seeing how often I have brought you sugar-plums in my\npocket? But I wish you joy with all my heart,--with all my heart.\nOriel is an excellent, good fellow.\"\n\n\"Is he not, doctor?\"\n\n\"An excellent, good fellow. I never heard but of one fault that he\nhad.\"\n\n\"What was that one fault, Doctor Thorne?\"\n\n\"He thought that clergymen should not marry. But you have cured that,\nand now he's perfect.\"\n\n\"Thank you, doctor. I declare that you say the prettiest things of\nall my friends.\"\n\n\"And none of your friends wish prettier things for you. I do\ncongratulate you, Beatrice, and hope you may be happy with the man\nyou have chosen;\" and taking both her hands in his, he pressed them\nwarmly, and bade God bless her.\n\n\"Oh, doctor! I do so hope the time will come when we shall all be\nfriends again.\"\n\n\"I hope it as well, my dear. But let it come, or let it not come, my\nregard for you will be the same:\" and then she parted from him also,\nand went her way.\n\nNothing was spoken of that evening between Dr Thorne and his niece\nexcepting Beatrice's future happiness; nothing, at least, having\nreference to what had passed that morning. But on the following\nmorning circumstances led to Frank Gresham's name being mentioned.\n\nAt the usual breakfast-hour the doctor entered the parlour with a\nharassed face. He had an open letter in his hand, and it was at once\nclear to Mary that he was going to speak on some subject that vexed\nhim.\n\n\"That unfortunate fellow is again in trouble. Here is a letter from\nGreyson.\" Greyson was a London apothecary, who had been appointed as\nmedical attendant to Sir Louis Scatcherd, and whose real business\nconsisted in keeping a watch on the baronet, and reporting to Dr\nThorne when anything was very much amiss. \"Here is a letter from\nGreyson; he has been drunk for the last three days, and is now laid\nup in a terribly nervous state.\"\n\n\"You won't go up to town again; will you, uncle?\"\n\n\"I hardly know what to do. No, I think not. He talks of coming down\nhere to Greshamsbury.\"\n\n\"Who, Sir Louis?\"\n\n\"Yes, Sir Louis. Greyson says that he will be down as soon as he can\nget out of his room.\"\n\n\"What! to this house?\"\n\n\"What other house can he come to?\"\n\n\"Oh, uncle! I hope not. Pray, pray do not let him come here.\"\n\n\"I cannot prevent it, my dear. I cannot shut my door on him.\"\n\nThey sat down to breakfast, and Mary gave him his tea in silence. \"I\nam going over to Boxall Hill before dinner,\" said he. \"Have you any\nmessage to send to Lady Scatcherd?\"\n\n\"Message! no, I have no message; not especially: give her my love,\nof course,\" she said listlessly. And then, as though a thought had\nsuddenly struck her, she spoke with more energy. \"But, couldn't I go\nto Boxall Hill again? I should be so delighted.\"\n\n\"What! to run away from Sir Louis? No, dearest, we will have no more\nrunning away. He will probably also go to Boxall Hill, and he could\nannoy you much more there than he can here.\"\n\n\"But, uncle, Mr Gresham will be home on the 12th,\" she said,\nblushing.\n\n\"What! Frank?\"\n\n\"Yes. Beatrice said he was to be here on the 12th.\"\n\n\"And would you run away from him too, Mary?\"\n\n\"I do not know: I do not know what to do.\"\n\n\"No; we will have no more running away: I am sorry that you ever did\nso. It was my fault, altogether my fault; but it was foolish.\"\n\n\"Uncle, I am not happy here.\" As she said this, she put down the cup\nwhich she had held, and, leaning her elbows on the table, rested her\nforehead on her hands.\n\n\"And would you be happier at Boxall Hill? It is not the place makes\nthe happiness.\"\n\n\"No, I know that; it is not the place. I do not look to be happy in\nany place; but I should be quieter, more tranquil elsewhere than\nhere.\"\n\n\"I also sometimes think that it will be better for us to take up our\nstaves and walk away out of Greshamsbury;--leave it altogether, and\nsettle elsewhere; miles, miles, miles away from here. Should you like\nthat, dearest?\"\n\nMiles, miles, miles away from Greshamsbury! There was something in\nthe sound that fell very cold on Mary's ears, unhappy as she was.\nGreshamsbury had been so dear to her; in spite of all that had\npassed, was still so dear to her! Was she prepared to take up her\nstaff, as her uncle said, and walk forth from the place with the\nfull understanding that she was to return to it no more; with a mind\nresolved that there should be an inseparable gulf between her and its\ninhabitants? Such she knew was the proposed nature of the walking\naway of which her uncle spoke. So she sat there, resting on her arms,\nand gave no answer to the question that had been asked her.\n\n\"No, we will stay a while yet,\" said her uncle. \"It may come to\nthat, but this is not the time. For one season longer let us face--I\nwill not say our enemies; I cannot call anybody my enemy who bears\nthe name of Gresham.\" And then he went on for a moment with his\nbreakfast. \"So Frank will be here on the 12th?\"\n\n\"Yes, uncle.\"\n\n\"Well, dearest, I have no questions to ask you: no directions to\ngive. I know how good you are, and how prudent; I am anxious only for\nyour happiness; not at all--\"\n\n\"Happiness, uncle, is out of the question.\"\n\n\"I hope not. It is never out of the question, never can be out of the\nquestion. But, as I was saying, I am quite satisfied your conduct\nwill be good, and, therefore, I have no questions to ask. We will\nremain here; and, whether good or evil come, we will not be ashamed\nto show our faces.\"\n\nShe sat for a while again silent, collecting her courage on the\nsubject that was nearest her heart. She would have given the world\nthat he should ask her questions; but she could not bid him to do so;\nand she found it impossible to talk openly to him about Frank unless\nhe did so. \"Will he come here?\" at last she said, in a low-toned\nvoice.\n\n\"Who? He, Louis? Yes, I think that in all probability he will.\"\n\n\"No; but Frank,\" she said, in a still lower voice.\n\n\"Ah! my darling, that I cannot tell; but will it be well that he\nshould come here?\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" she said. \"No, I suppose not. But, uncle, I don't\nthink he will come.\"\n\nShe was now sitting on a sofa away from the table, and he got up, sat\ndown beside her, and took her hands in his. \"Mary,\" said he, \"you\nmust be strong now; strong to endure, not to attack. I think you have\nthat strength; but, if not, perhaps it will be better that we should\ngo away.\"\n\n\"I will be strong,\" said she, rising up and going towards the door.\n\"Never mind me, uncle; don't follow me; I will be strong. It will be\nbase, cowardly, mean, to run away; very base in me to make you do\nso.\"\n\n\"No, dearest, not so; it will be the same to me.\"\n\n\"No,\" said she, \"I will not run away from Lady Arabella. And, as for\nhim--if he loves this other one, he shall hear no reproach from me.\nUncle, I will be strong;\" and running back to him, she threw her\narms round him and kissed him. And, still restraining her tears, she\ngot safely to her bedroom. In what way she may there have shown her\nstrength, it would not be well for us to inquire.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\nA Barouche and Four Arrives at Greshamsbury\n\n\nDuring the last twelve months Sir Louis Scatcherd had been very\nefficacious in bringing trouble, turmoil, and vexation upon\nGreshamsbury. Now that it was too late to take steps to save himself,\nDr Thorne found that the will left by Sir Roger was so made as to\nentail upon him duties that he would find it almost impossible to\nperform. Sir Louis, though his father had wished to make him still\na child in the eye of the law, was no child. He knew his own rights\nand was determined to exact them; and before Sir Roger had been dead\nthree months, the doctor found himself in continual litigation with\na low Barchester attorney, who was acting on behalf of his, the\ndoctor's, own ward.\n\nAnd if the doctor suffered so did the squire, and so did those who\nhad hitherto had the management of the squire's affairs. Dr Thorne\nsoon perceived that he was to be driven into litigation, not only\nwith Mr Finnie, the Barchester attorney, but with the squire himself.\nWhile Finnie harassed him, he was compelled to harass Mr Gresham. He\nwas no lawyer himself; and though he had been able to manage very\nwell between the squire and Sir Roger, and had perhaps given himself\nsome credit for his lawyer-like ability in so doing, he was utterly\nunable to manage between Sir Louis and Mr Gresham.\n\nHe had, therefore, to employ a lawyer on his own account, and it\nseemed probable that the whole amount of Sir Roger's legacy to\nhimself would by degrees be expended in this manner. And then, the\nsquire's lawyers had to take up the matter; and they did so greatly\nto the detriment of poor Mr Yates Umbleby, who was found to have made\na mess of the affairs entrusted to him. Mr Umbleby's accounts were\nincorrect; his mind was anything but clear, and he confessed, when\nput to it by the very sharp gentleman that came down from London,\nthat he was \"bothered;\" and so, after a while, he was suspended from\nhis duties, and Mr Gazebee, the sharp gentleman from London, reigned\nover the diminished rent-roll of the Greshamsbury estate.\n\nThus everything was going wrong at Greshamsbury--with the one\nexception of Mr Oriel and his love-suit. Miss Gushing attributed\nthe deposition of Mr Umbleby to the narrowness of the victory which\nBeatrice had won in carrying off Mr Oriel. For Miss Gushing was a\nrelation of the Umblebys, and had been for many years one of their\nfamily. \"If she had only chosen to exert herself as Miss Gresham had\ndone, she could have had Mr Oriel, easily; oh, too easily! but she\nhad despised such work,\" so she said. \"But though she had despised\nit, the Greshams had not been less irritated, and, therefore, Mr\nUmbleby had been driven out of his house.\" We can hardly believe\nthis, as victory generally makes men generous. Miss Gushing, however,\nstated it as a fact so often that it is probable she was induced to\nbelieve it herself.\n\nThus everything was going wrong at Greshamsbury, and the squire\nhimself was especially a sufferer. Umbleby had at any rate been his\nown man, and he could do what he liked with him. He could see him\nwhen he liked, and where he liked, and how he liked; could scold him\nif in an ill-humour, and laugh at him when in a good humour. All this\nMr Umbleby knew, and bore. But Mr Gazebee was a very different sort\nof gentleman; he was the junior partner in the firm of Gumption,\nGazebee & Gazebee, of Mount Street, a house that never defiled\nitself with any other business than the agency business, and that in\nthe very highest line. They drew out leases, and managed property\nboth for the Duke of Omnium and Lord de Courcy; and ever since her\nmarriage, it had been one of the objects dearest to Lady Arabella's\nheart, that the Greshamsbury acres should be superintended by the\npolite skill and polished legal ability of that all but elegant firm\nin Mount Street.\n\nThe squire had long stood firm, and had delighted in having\neverything done under his own eye by poor Mr Yates Umbleby. But now,\nalas! he could stand it no longer. He had put off the evil day as\nlong as he could; he had deferred the odious work of investigation\ntill things had seemed resolved on investigating themselves; and\nthen, when it was absolutely necessary that Mr Umbleby should go,\nthere was nothing for him left but to fall into the ready hands of\nMessrs Gumption, Gazebee and Gazebee.\n\nIt must not be supposed that Messrs Gumption, Gazebee & Gazebee\nwere in the least like the ordinary run of attorneys. They wrote\nno letters for six-and-eightpence each: they collected no debts,\nfiled no bills, made no charge per folio for \"whereases\" and \"as\naforesaids;\" they did no dirty work, and probably were as ignorant\nof the interior of a court of law as any young lady living in their\nMayfair vicinity. No; their business was to manage the property of\ngreat people, draw up leases, make legal assignments, get the family\nmarriage settlements made, and look after wills. Occasionally, also,\nthey had to raise money; but it was generally understood that this\nwas done by proxy.\n\nThe firm had been going on for a hundred and fifty years, and the\ndesignation had often been altered; but it always consisted of\nGumptions and Gazebees differently arranged, and no less hallowed\nnames had ever been permitted to appear. It had been Gazebee, Gazebee\n& Gumption; then Gazebee & Gumption; then Gazebee, Gumption &\nGumption; then Gumption, Gumption & Gazebee; and now it was Gumption,\nGazebee & Gazebee.\n\nMr Gazebee, the junior member of this firm, was a very elegant young\nman. While looking at him riding in Rotten Row, you would hardly have\ntaken him for an attorney; and had he heard that you had so taken\nhim, he would have been very much surprised indeed. He was rather\nbald; not being, as people say, quite so young as he was once. His\nexact age was thirty-eight. But he had a really remarkable pair of\njet-black whiskers, which fully made up for any deficiency as to his\nhead; he had also dark eyes, and a beaked nose, what may be called a\ndistinguished mouth, and was always dressed in fashionable attire.\nThe fact was, that Mr Mortimer Gazebee, junior partner in the firm\nGumption, Gazebee & Gazebee, by no means considered himself to be\nmade of that very disagreeable material which mortals call small\nbeer.\n\nWhen this great firm was applied to, to get Mr Gresham through his\ndifficulties, and when the state of his affairs was made known to\nthem, they at first expressed rather a disinclination for the work.\nBut at last, moved doubtless by their respect for the de Courcy\ninterest, they assented; and Mr Gazebee, junior, went down to\nGreshamsbury. The poor squire passed many a sad day after that before\nhe again felt himself to be master even of his own domain.\n\nNevertheless, when Mr Mortimer Gazebee visited Greshamsbury, which\nhe did on more than one or two occasions, he was always received _en\ngrand seigneur_. To Lady Arabella he was by no means an unwelcome\nguest, for she found herself able, for the first time in her life, to\nspeak confidentially on her husband's pecuniary affairs with the man\nwho had the management of her husband's property. Mr Gazebee also was\na pet with Lady de Courcy; and being known to be a fashionable man in\nLondon, and quite a different sort of person from poor Mr Umbleby,\nhe was always received with smiles. He had a hundred little ways of\nmaking himself agreeable, and Augusta declared to her cousin, the\nLady Amelia, after having been acquainted with him for a few months,\nthat he would be a perfect gentleman, only, that his family had\nnever been anything but attorneys. The Lady Amelia smiled in her own\npeculiarly aristocratic way, shrugged her shoulders slightly, and\nsaid, \"that Mr Mortimer Gazebee was a very good sort of a person,\nvery.\" Poor Augusta felt herself snubbed, thinking perhaps of the\ntailor's son; but as there was never any appeal against the Lady\nAmelia, she said nothing more at that moment in favour of Mr Mortimer\nGazebee.\n\nAll these evils--Mr Mortimer Gazebee being the worst of them--had Sir\nLouis Scatcherd brought down on the poor squire's head. There may be\nthose who will say that the squire had brought them on himself, by\nrunning into debt; and so, doubtless, he had; but it was not the less\ntrue that the baronet's interference was unnecessary, vexatious, and\none might almost say, malicious. His interest would have been quite\nsafe in the doctor's hands, and he had, in fact, no legal right to\nmeddle; but neither the doctor nor the squire could prevent him. Mr\nFinnie knew very well what he was about, if Sir Louis did not; and\nso the three went on, each with his own lawyer, and each of them\ndistrustful, unhappy, and ill at ease. This was hard upon the doctor,\nfor he was not in debt, and had borrowed no money.\n\nThere was not much reason to suppose that the visit of Sir Louis to\nGreshamsbury would much improve matters. It must be presumed that he\nwas not coming with any amicable views, but with the object rather\nof looking after his own; a phrase which was now constantly in his\nmouth. He might probably find it necessary while looking after his\nown at Greshamsbury, to say some very disagreeable things to the\nsquire; and the doctor, therefore, hardly expected that the visit\nwould go off pleasantly.\n\nWhen last we saw Sir Louis, now nearly twelve months since, he\nwas intent on making a proposal of marriage to Miss Thorne. This\nintention he carried out about two days after Frank Gresham had done\nthe same thing. He had delayed doing so till he had succeeded in\npurchasing his friend Jenkins's Arab pony, imagining that such a\npresent could not but go far in weaning Mary's heart from her other\nlover. Poor Mary was put to the trouble of refusing both the baronet\nand the pony, and a very bad time she had of it while doing so. Sir\nLouis was a man easily angered, and not very easily pacified, and\nMary had to endure a good deal of annoyance; from any other person,\nindeed, she would have called it impertinence. Sir Louis, however,\nhad to bear his rejection as best he could, and, after a perseverance\nof three days, returned to London in disgust; and Mary had not seen\nhim since.\n\nMr Greyson's first letter was followed by a second; and the second\nwas followed by the baronet in person. He also required to be\nreceived _en grand seigneur_, perhaps more imperatively than Mr\nMortimer Gazebee himself. He came with four posters from the\nBarchester Station, and had himself rattled up to the doctor's door\nin a way that took the breath away from all Greshamsbury. Why! the\nsquire himself for a many long year had been contented to come home\nwith a pair of horses; and four were never seen in the place, except\nwhen the de Courcys came to Greshamsbury, or Lady Arabella with all\nher daughters returned from her hard-fought metropolitan campaigns.\n\nSir Louis, however, came with four, and very arrogant he looked,\nleaning back in the barouche belonging to the George and Dragon,\nand wrapped up in fur, although it was now midsummer. And up in the\ndicky behind was a servant, more arrogant, if possible, than his\nmaster--the baronet's own man, who was the object of Dr Thorne's\nspecial detestation and disgust. He was a little fellow, chosen\noriginally on account of his light weight on horseback; but if that\nmay be considered a merit, it was the only one he had. His out-door\nshow dress was a little tight frock-coat, round which a polished\nstrap was always buckled tightly, a stiff white choker, leather\nbreeches, top-boots, and a hat, with a cockade, stuck on one side\nof his head. His name was Jonah, which his master and his master's\nfriends shortened into Joe; none, however, but those who were very\nintimate with his master were allowed to do so with impunity.\n\nThis Joe was Dr Thorne's special aversion. In his anxiety to take\nevery possible step to keep Sir Louis from poisoning himself, he had\nat first attempted to enlist the baronet's \"own man\" in the cause.\nJoe had promised fairly, but had betrayed the doctor at once, and\nhad become the worst instrument of his master's dissipation. When,\ntherefore, his hat and the cockade were seen, as the carriage dashed\nup to the door, the doctor's contentment was by no means increased.\n\nSir Louis was now twenty-three years old, and was a great deal too\nknowing to allow himself to be kept under the doctor's thumb. It\nhad, indeed, become his plan to rebel against his guardian in almost\neverything. He had at first been decently submissive, with the view\nof obtaining increased supplies of ready money; but he had been sharp\nenough to perceive that, let his conduct be what it would, the doctor\nwould keep him out of debt; but that the doing so took so large a sum\nthat he could not hope for any further advances. In this respect Sir\nLouis was perhaps more keen-witted than Dr Thorne.\n\nMary, when she saw the carriage, at once ran up to her own bedroom.\nThe doctor, who had been with her in the drawing-room, went down to\nmeet his ward, but as soon as he saw the cockade he darted almost\ninvoluntarily into his shop and shut the door. This protection,\nhowever, lasted only for a moment; he felt that decency required him\nto meet his guest, and so he went forth and faced the enemy.\n\n\"I say,\" said Joe, speaking to Janet, who stood curtsying at the\ngate, with Bridget, the other maid, behind her, \"I say, are there\nany chaps about the place to take these things--eh? come, look sharp\nhere.\"\n\nIt so happened that the doctor's groom was not on the spot, and\n\"other chaps\" the doctor had none.\n\n\"Take those things, Bridget,\" he said, coming forward and offering\nhis hand to the baronet. Sir Louis, when he saw his host, roused\nhimself slowly from the back of his carriage. \"How do, doctor?\" said\nhe. \"What terrible bad roads you have here! and, upon my word, it's\nas cold as winter:\" and, so saying, he slowly proceeded to descend.\n\nSir Louis was a year older than when we last saw him, and, in his\ngeneration, a year wiser. He had then been somewhat humble before the\ndoctor; but now he was determined to let his guardian see that he\nknew how to act the baronet; that he had acquired the manners of a\ngreat man; and that he was not to be put upon. He had learnt some\nlessons from Jenkins, in London, and other friends of the same sort,\nand he was about to profit by them.\n\nThe doctor showed him to his room, and then proceeded to ask after\nhis health. \"Oh, I'm right enough,\" said Sir Louis. \"You mustn't\nbelieve all that fellow Greyson tells you: he wants me to take salts\nand senna, opodeldoc, and all that sort of stuff; looks after his\nbill, you know--eh? like all the rest of you. But I won't have\nit;--not at any price; and then he writes to you.\"\n\n\"I'm glad to see you able to travel,\" said Dr Thorne, who could not\nforce himself to tell his guest that he was glad to see him at\nGreshamsbury.\n\n\"Oh, travel; yes, I can travel well enough. But I wish you had some\nbetter sort of trap down in these country parts. I'm shaken to bits.\nAnd, doctor, would you tell your people to send that fellow of mine\nup here with hot water.\"\n\nSo dismissed, the doctor went his way, and met Joe swaggering in one\nof the passages, while Janet and her colleague dragged along between\nthem a heavy article of baggage.\n\n\"Janet,\" said he, \"go downstairs and get Sir Louis some hot water,\nand Joe, do you take hold of your master's portmanteau.\"\n\nJoe sulkily did as he was bid. \"Seems to me,\" said he, turning to\nthe girl, and speaking before the doctor was out of hearing, \"seems\nto me, my dear, you be rather short-handed here; lots of work and\nnothing to get; that's about the ticket, ain't it?\" Bridget was too\ndemurely modest to make any answer upon so short an acquaintance; so,\nputting her end of the burden down at the strange gentleman's door,\nshe retreated into the kitchen.\n\nSir Louis, in answer to the doctor's inquiries, had declared himself\nto be all right; but his appearance was anything but all right.\nTwelve months since, a life of dissipation, or rather, perhaps, a\nlife of drinking, had not had upon him so strong an effect but that\nsome of the salt of youth was still left; some of the freshness of\nyoung years might still be seen in his face. But this was now all\ngone; his eyes were sunken and watery, his cheeks were hollow and\nwan, his mouth was drawn and his lips dry; his back was even bent,\nand his legs were unsteady under him, so that he had been forced to\nstep down from his carriage as an old man would do. Alas, alas! he\nhad no further chance now of ever being all right again.\n\nMary had secluded herself in her bedroom as soon as the carriage had\ndriven up to the door, and there she remained till dinner-time. But\nshe could not shut herself up altogether. It would be necessary that\nshe should appear at dinner; and, therefore, a few minutes before the\nhour, she crept out into the drawing-room. As she opened the door,\nshe looked in timidly, expecting Sir Louis to be there; but when\nshe saw that her uncle was the only occupant of the room, her brow\ncleared, and she entered with a quick step.\n\n\"He'll come down to dinner; won't he, uncle?\"\n\n\"Oh, I suppose so.\"\n\n\"What's he doing now?\"\n\n\"Dressing, I suppose; he's been at it this hour.\"\n\n\"But, uncle--\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Will he come up after dinner, do you think?\"\n\nMary spoke of him as though he were some wild beast, whom her uncle\ninsisted on having in his house.\n\n\"Goodness knows what he will do! Come up? Yes. He will not stay in\nthe dining-room all night.\"\n\n\"But, dear uncle, do be serious.\"\n\n\"Serious!\"\n\n\"Yes; serious. Don't you think that I might go to bed, instead of\nwaiting?\"\n\nThe doctor was saved the trouble of answering by the entrance of the\nbaronet. He was dressed in what he considered the most fashionable\nstyle of the day. He had on a new dress-coat lined with satin,\nnew dress-trousers, a silk waistcoat covered with chains, a white\ncravat, polished pumps, and silk stockings, and he carried a scented\nhandkerchief in his hand; he had rings on his fingers, and carbuncle\nstuds in his shirt, and he smelt as sweet as patchouli could make\nhim. But he could hardly do more than shuffle into the room, and\nseemed almost to drag one of his legs behind him.\n\nMary, in spite of her aversion, was shocked and distressed when she\nsaw him. He, however, seemed to think himself perfect, and was no\nwhit abashed by the unfavourable reception which twelve months since\nhad been paid to his suit. Mary came up and shook hands with him, and\nhe received her with a compliment which no doubt he thought must be\nacceptable. \"Upon my word, Miss Thorne, every place seems to agree\nwith you; one better than another. You were looking charming at\nBoxall Hill; but, upon my word, charming isn't half strong enough\nnow.\"\n\nMary sat down quietly, and the doctor assumed a face of unutterable\ndisgust. This was the creature for whom all his sympathies had been\ndemanded, all his best energies put in requisition; on whose behalf\nhe was to quarrel with his oldest friends, lose his peace and\nquietness of life, and exercise all the functions of a loving friend!\nThis was his self-invited guest, whom he was bound to foster, and\nwhom he could not turn from his door.\n\nThen dinner came, and Mary had to put her hand upon his arm. She\ncertainly did not lean upon him, and once or twice felt inclined to\ngive him some support. They reached the dining-room, however, the\ndoctor following them, and then sat down, Janet waiting in the room,\nas was usual.\n\n\"I say, doctor,\" said the baronet, \"hadn't my man better come in\nand help? He's got nothing to do, you know. We should be more cosy,\nshouldn't we?\"\n\n\"Janet will manage pretty well,\" said the doctor.\n\n\"Oh, you'd better have Joe; there's nothing like a good servant at\ntable. I say, Janet, just send that fellow in, will you?\"\n\n\"We shall do very well without him,\" said the doctor, becoming rather\nred about the cheek-bones, and with a slight gleam of determination\nabout the eye. Janet, who saw how matters stood, made no attempt to\nobey the baronet's order.\n\n\"Oh, nonsense, doctor; you think he's an uppish sort of fellow, I\nknow, and you don't like to trouble him; but when I'm near him, he's\nall right; just send him in, will you?\"\n\n\"Sir Louis,\" said the doctor, \"I'm accustomed to none but my own old\nwoman here in my own house, and if you will allow me, I'll keep my\nold ways. I shall be sorry if you are not comfortable.\" The baronet\nsaid nothing more, and the dinner passed off slowly and wearily\nenough.\n\nWhen Mary had eaten her fruit and escaped, the doctor got into one\narm-chair and the baronet into another, and the latter began the only\nwork of existence of which he knew anything.\n\n\"That's good port,\" said he; \"very fair port.\"\n\nThe doctor loved his port wine, and thawed a little in his manner. He\nloved it not as a toper, but as a collector loves his pet pictures.\nHe liked to talk about it, and think about it; to praise it, and hear\nit praised; to look at it turned towards the light, and to count over\nthe years it had lain in his cellar.\n\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"it's pretty fair wine. It was, at least, when I got\nit, twenty years ago, and I don't suppose time has hurt it;\" and he\nheld the glass up to the window, and looked at the evening light\nthrough the ruby tint of the liquid. \"Ah, dear, there's not much of\nit left; more's the pity.\"\n\n\"A good thing won't last for ever. I'll tell you what now; I wish\nI'd brought down a dozen or two of claret. I've some prime stuff in\nLondon; got it from Muzzle & Drug, at ninety-six shillings; it was\na great favour, though. I'll tell you what now, I'll send up for a\ncouple of dozen to-morrow. I mustn't drink you out of house, high and\ndry; must I, doctor?\"\n\nThe doctor froze immediately.\n\n\"I don't think I need trouble you,\" said he; \"I never drink claret,\nat least not here; and there's enough of the old bin left to last\nsome little time longer yet.\"\n\nSir Louis drank two or three glasses of wine very quickly after each\nother, and they immediately began to tell upon his weak stomach. But\nbefore he was tipsy, he became more impudent and more disagreeable.\n\n\"Doctor,\" said he, \"when are we to see any of this Greshamsbury\nmoney? That's what I want to know.\"\n\n\"Your money is quite safe, Sir Louis; and the interest is paid to the\nday.\"\n\n\"Interest, yes; but how do I know how long it will be paid? I should\nlike to see the principal. A hundred thousand pounds, or something\nlike it, is a precious large stake to have in one man's hands, and he\npreciously hard up himself. I'll tell you what, doctor--I shall look\nthe squire up myself.\"\n\n\"Look him up?\"\n\n\"Yes; look him up; ferret him out; tell him a bit of my mind. I'll\nthank you to pass the bottle. D---- me doctor; I mean to know how\nthings are going on.\"\n\n\"Your money is quite safe,\" repeated the doctor, \"and, to my mind,\ncould not be better invested.\"\n\n\"That's all very well; d---- well, I dare say, for you and Squire\nGresham--\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Sir Louis?\"\n\n\"Mean! why I mean that I'll sell the squire up; that's what I\nmean--hallo--beg pardon. I'm blessed if I haven't broken the\nwater-jug. That comes of having water on the table. Oh, d---- me,\nit's all over me.\" And then, getting up, to avoid the flood he\nhimself had caused, he nearly fell into the doctor's arms.\n\n\"You're tired with your journey, Sir Louis; perhaps you'd better go\nto bed.\"\n\n\"Well, I am a bit seedy or so. Those cursed roads of yours shake a\nfellow so.\"\n\nThe doctor rang the bell, and, on this occasion, did request that Joe\nmight be sent for. Joe came in, and, though he was much steadier than\nhis master, looked as though he also had found some bin of which he\nhad approved.\n\n\"Sir Louis wishes to go to bed,\" said the doctor; \"you had better\ngive him your arm.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; in course I will,\" said Joe, standing immoveable about\nhalf-way between the door and the table.\n\n\"I'll just take one more glass of the old port--eh, doctor?\" said Sir\nLouis, putting out his hand and clutching the decanter.\n\nIt is very hard for any man to deny his guest in his own house, and\nthe doctor, at the moment, did not know how to do it; so Sir Louis\ngot his wine, after pouring half of it over the table.\n\n\"Come in, sir, and give Sir Louis your arm,\" said the doctor,\nangrily.\n\n\"So I will in course, if my master tells me; but, if you please, Dr\nThorne,\"--and Joe put his hand up to his hair in a manner that had a\ngreat deal more of impudence than reverence in it--\"I just want to ax\none question: where be I to sleep?\"\n\nNow this was a question which the doctor was not prepared to answer\non the spur of the moment, however well Janet or Mary might have been\nable to do so.\n\n\"Sleep,\" said he, \"I don't know where you are to sleep, and don't\ncare; ask Janet.\"\n\n\"That's all very well, master--\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue, sirrah!\" said Sir Louis. \"What the devil do you\nwant of sleep?--come here,\" and then, with his servant's help, he\nmade his way up to his bedroom, and was no more heard of that night.\n\n\"Did he get tipsy,\" asked Mary, almost in a whisper, when her uncle\njoined her in the drawing-room.\n\n\"Don't talk of it,\" said he. \"Poor wretch! poor wretch! Let's\nhave some tea now, Molly, and pray don't talk any more about him\nto-night.\" Then Mary did make the tea, and did not talk any more\nabout Sir Louis that night.\n\nWhat on earth were they to do with him? He had come there\nself-invited; but his connexion with the doctor was such, that it\nwas impossible he should be told to go away, either he himself, or\nthat servant of his. There was no reason to disbelieve him when he\ndeclared that he had come down to ferret out the squire. Such was,\ndoubtless, his intention. He would ferret out the squire. Perhaps he\nmight ferret out Lady Arabella also. Frank would be home in a few\ndays; and he, too, might be ferreted out.\n\nBut the matter took a very singular turn, and one quite unexpected\non the doctor's part. On the morning following the little dinner of\nwhich we have spoken, one of the Greshamsbury grooms rode up to the\ndoctor's door with two notes. One was addressed to the doctor in the\nsquire's well-known large handwriting, and the other was for Sir\nLouis. Each contained an invitation to dinner for the following day;\nand that to the doctor was in this wise:--\n\n\n   DEAR DOCTOR,\n\n   Do come and dine here to-morrow, and bring Sir Louis\n   Scatcherd with you. If you're the man I take you to be,\n   you won't refuse me. Lady Arabella sends a note for\n   Sir Louis. There will be nobody here but Oriel, and Mr\n   Gazebee, who is staying in the house.\n\n   Yours ever,\n\n   F. N. GRESHAM.\n\n   Greshamsbury, July, 185--.\n\n   P.S.--I make a positive request that you'll come, and I\n   think you will hardly refuse me.\n\n\nThe doctor read it twice before he could believe it, and then ordered\nJanet to take the other note up to Sir Louis. As these invitations\nwere rather in opposition to the then existing Greshamsbury tactics,\nthe cause of Lady Arabella's special civility must be explained.\n\nMr Mortimer Gazebee was now at the house, and therefore, it must\nbe presumed, that things were not allowed to go on after their old\nfashion. Mr Gazebee was an acute as well as a fashionable man; one\nwho knew what he was about, and who, moreover, had determined to give\nhis very best efforts on behalf of the Greshamsbury property. His\nenergy, in this respect, will explain itself hereafter. It was not\nprobable that the arrival in the village of such a person as Sir\nLouis Scatcherd should escape attention. He had heard of it before\ndinner, and, before the evening was over, had discussed it with Lady\nArabella.\n\nHer ladyship was not at first inclined to make much of Sir Louis, and\nexpressed herself as but little inclined to agree with Mr Gazebee\nwhen that gentleman suggested that he should be treated with civility\nat Greshamsbury. But she was at last talked over. She found it\npleasant enough to have more to do with the secret management of the\nestate than Mr Gresham himself; and when Mr Gazebee proved to her,\nby sundry nods and winks, and subtle allusions to her own infinite\ngood sense, that it was necessary to catch this obscene bird which\nhad come to prey upon the estate, by throwing a little salt upon his\ntail, she also nodded and winked, and directed Augusta to prepare the\nsalt according to order.\n\n\"But won't it be odd, Mr Gazebee, asking him out of Dr Thorne's\nhouse?\"\n\n\"Oh, we must have the doctor, too, Lady Arabella; by all means ask\nthe doctor also.\"\n\nLady Arabella's brow grew dark. \"Mr Gazebee,\" she said, \"you can\nhardly believe how that man has behaved to me.\"\n\n\"He is altogether beneath your anger,\" said Mr Gazebee, with a bow.\n\n\"I don't know: in one way he may be, but not in another. I really do\nnot think I can sit down to table with Doctor Thorne.\"\n\nBut, nevertheless, Mr Gazebee gained his point. It was now about a\nweek since Sir Omicron Pie had been at Greshamsbury, and the squire\nhad, almost daily, spoken to his wife as to that learned man's\nadvice. Lady Arabella always answered in the same tone: \"You can\nhardly know, Mr Gresham, how that man has insulted me.\" But,\nnevertheless, the physician's advice had not been disbelieved: it\ntallied too well with her own inward convictions. She was anxious\nenough to have Doctor Thorne back at her bedside, if she could only\nget him there without damage to her pride. Her husband, she thought,\nmight probably send the doctor there without absolute permission from\nherself; in which case she would have been able to scold, and show\nthat she was offended; and, at the same time, profit by what had been\ndone. But Mr Gresham never thought of taking so violent a step as\nthis, and, therefore, Dr Fillgrave still came, and her ladyship's\n_finesse_ was wasted in vain.\n\nBut Mr Gazebee's proposition opened a door by which her point might\nbe gained. \"Well,\" said she, at last, with infinite self-denial, \"if\nyou think it is for Mr Gresham's advantage, and if he chooses to ask\nDr Thorne, I will not refuse to receive him.\"\n\nMr Gazebee's next task was to discuss the matter with the squire. Nor\nwas this easy, for Mr Gazebee was no favourite with Mr Gresham. But\nthe task was at last performed successfully. Mr Gresham was so glad\nat heart to find himself able, once more, to ask his old friend to\nhis own house; and, though it would have pleased him better that this\nsign of relenting on his wife's part should have reached him by other\nmeans, he did not refuse to take advantage of it; and so he wrote the\nabove letter to Dr Thorne.\n\nThe doctor, as we have said, read it twice; and he at once resolved\nstoutly that he would not go.\n\n\"Oh, do, do go!\" said Mary. She well knew how wretched this feud had\nmade her uncle. \"Pray, pray go!\"\n\n\"Indeed, I will not,\" said he. \"There are some things a man should\nbear, and some he should not.\"\n\n\"You must go,\" said Mary, who had taken the note from her uncle's\nhand, and read it. \"You cannot refuse him when he asks you like\nthat.\"\n\n\"It will greatly grieve me; but I must refuse him.\"\n\n\"I also am angry, uncle; very angry with Lady Arabella; but for him,\nfor the squire, I would go to him on my knees if he asked me in that\nway.\"\n\n\"Yes; and had he asked you, I also would have gone.\"\n\n\"Oh! now I shall be so wretched. It is his invitation, not hers: Mr\nGresham could not ask me. As for her, do not think of her; but do, do\ngo when he asks you like that. You will make me so miserable if you\ndo not. And then Sir Louis cannot go without you,\"--and Mary pointed\nupstairs--\"and you may be sure that he will go.\"\n\n\"Yes; and make a beast of himself.\"\n\nThis colloquy was cut short by a message praying the doctor to go up\nto Sir Louis's room. The young man was sitting in his dressing-gown,\ndrinking a cup of coffee at his toilet-table, while Joe was preparing\nhis razor and hot water. The doctor's nose immediately told him\nthat there was more in the coffee-cup than had come out of his own\nkitchen, and he would not let the offence pass unnoticed.\n\n\"Are you taking brandy this morning, Sir Louis?\"\n\n\"Just a little _chasse-caf\u00c3\u00a9_,\" said he, not exactly understanding\nthe word he used. \"It's all the go now; and a capital thing for the\nstomach.\"\n\n\"It's not a capital thing for your stomach;--about the least capital\nthing you can take; that is, if you wish to live.\"\n\n\"Never mind about that now, doctor, but look here. This is what we\ncall the civil thing--eh?\" and he showed the Greshamsbury note. \"Not\nbut what they have an object, of course. I understand all that. Lots\nof girls there--eh?\"\n\nThe doctor took the note and read it. \"It is civil,\" said he; \"very\ncivil.\"\n\n\"Well; I shall go, of course. I don't bear malice because he can't\npay me the money he owes me. I'll eat his dinner, and look at the\ngirls. Have you an invite too, doctor?\"\n\n\"Yes; I have.\"\n\n\"And you'll go?\"\n\n\"I think not; but that need not deter you. But, Sir Louis--\"\n\n\"Well! eh! what is it?\"\n\n\"Step downstairs a moment,\" said the doctor, turning to the servant,\n\"and wait till you are called for. I wish to speak to your master.\"\nJoe, for a moment, looked up at the baronet's face, as though he\nwanted but the slightest encouragement to disobey the doctor's\norders; but not seeing it, he slowly retired, and placed himself, of\ncourse, at the keyhole.\n\nAnd then, the doctor began a long and very useless lecture. The first\nobject of it was to induce his ward not to get drunk at Greshamsbury;\nbut having got so far, he went on, and did succeed in frightening\nhis unhappy guest. Sir Louis did not possess the iron nerves of\nhis father--nerves which even brandy had not been able to subdue.\nThe doctor spoke strongly, very strongly; spoke of quick, almost\nimmediate death in case of further excesses; spoke to him of the\ncertainty there would be that he could not live to dispose of his own\nproperty if he could not refrain. And thus he did frighten Sir Louis.\nThe father he had never been able to frighten. But there are men\nwho, though they fear death hugely, fear present suffering more;\nwho, indeed, will not bear a moment of pain if there be any mode of\nescape. Sir Louis was such: he had no strength of nerve, no courage,\nno ability to make a resolution and keep it. He promised the doctor\nthat he would refrain; and, as he did so, he swallowed down his cup\nof coffee and brandy, in which the two articles bore about equal\nproportions.\n\nThe doctor did, at last, make up his mind to go. Whichever way he\ndetermined, he found that he was not contented with himself. He did\nnot like to trust Sir Louis by himself, and he did not like to show\nthat he was angry. Still less did he like the idea of breaking bread\nin Lady Arabella's house till some amends had been made to Mary. But\nhis heart would not allow him to refuse the petition contained in\nthe squire's postscript, and the matter ended in his accepting the\ninvitation.\n\nThis visit of his ward's was, in every way, pernicious to the doctor.\nHe could not go about his business, fearing to leave such a man alone\nwith Mary. On the afternoon of the second day, she escaped to the\nparsonage for an hour or so, and then walked away among the lanes,\ncalling on some of her old friends among the farmers' wives. But even\nthen, the doctor was afraid to leave Sir Louis. What could such a\nman do, left alone in a village like Greshamsbury? So he stayed at\nhome, and the two together went over their accounts. The baronet was\nparticular about his accounts, and said a good deal as to having\nFinnie over to Greshamsbury. To this, however, Dr Thorne positively\nrefused his consent.\n\nThe evening passed off better than the preceding one; at least the\nearly part of it. Sir Louis did not get tipsy; he came up to tea, and\nMary, who did not feel so keenly on the subject as her uncle, almost\nwished that he had done so. At ten o'clock he went to bed.\n\nBut after that new troubles came on. The doctor had gone downstairs\ninto his study to make up some of the time which he had lost, and\nhad just seated himself at his desk, when Janet, without announcing\nherself, burst into the room; and Bridget, dissolved in hysterical\ntears, with her apron to her eyes, appeared behind the senior\ndomestic.\n\n\"Please, sir,\" said Janet, driven by excitement much beyond her\nusual pace of speaking, and becoming unintentionally a little less\nrespectful than usual, \"please sir, that 'ere young man must go out\nof this here house; or else no respectable young 'ooman can't stop\nhere; no, indeed, sir; and we be sorry to trouble you, Dr Thorne; so\nwe be.\"\n\n\"What young man? Sir Louis?\" asked the doctor.\n\n\"Oh, no! he abides mostly in bed, and don't do nothing amiss; least\nway not to us. 'Tan't him, sir; but his man.\"\n\n\"Man!\" sobbed Bridget from behind. \"He an't no man, nor nothing\nlike a man. If Tummas had been here, he wouldn't have dared; so he\nwouldn't.\" Thomas was the groom, and, if all Greshamsbury reports\nwere true, it was probable, that on some happy, future day, Thomas\nand Bridget would become one flesh and one bone.\n\n\"Please sir,\" continued Janet, \"there'll be bad work here if that\n'ere young man doesn't quit this here house this very night, and I'm\nsorry to trouble you, doctor; and so I am. But Tom, he be given to\nfight a'most for nothin'. He's hout now; but if that there young man\nbe's here when Tom comes home, Tom will be punching his head; I know\nhe will.\"\n\n\"He wouldn't stand by and see a poor girl put upon; no more he\nwouldn't,\" said Bridget, through her tears.\n\nAfter many futile inquiries, the doctor ascertained that Mr Jonah had\nexpressed some admiration for Bridget's youthful charms, and had, in\nthe absence of Janet, thrown himself at the lady's feet in a manner\nwhich had not been altogether pleasing to her. She had defended\nherself stoutly and loudly, and in the middle of the row Janet had\ncome down.\n\n\"And where is he now?\" said the doctor.\n\n\"Why, sir,\" said Janet, \"the poor girl was so put about that she did\ngive him one touch across the face with the rolling-pin, and he be\nall bloody now, in the back kitchen.\" At hearing this achievement of\nhers thus spoken of, Bridget sobbed more hysterically than ever; but\nthe doctor, looking at her arm as she held her apron to her face,\nthought in his heart that Joe must have had so much the worst of it,\nthat there could be no possible need for the interference of Thomas\nthe groom.\n\nAnd such turned out to be the case. The bridge of Joe's nose was\nbroken; and the doctor had to set it for him in a little bedroom at\nthe village public-house, Bridget having positively refused to go to\nbed in the same house with so dreadful a character.\n\n\"Quiet now, or I'll be serving thee the same way; thee see I've found\nthe trick of it.\" The doctor could not but hear so much as he made\nhis way into his own house by the back door, after finishing his\nsurgical operation. Bridget was recounting to her champion the fracas\nthat had occurred; and he, as was so natural, was expressing his\nadmiration at her valour.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV\n\nSir Louis Goes Out to Dinner\n\n\nThe next day Joe did not make his appearance, and Sir Louis, with\nmany execrations, was driven to the terrible necessity of dressing\nhimself. Then came an unexpected difficulty: how were they to get up\nto the house? Walking out to dinner, though it was merely through\nthe village and up the avenue, seemed to Sir Louis to be a thing\nimpossible. Indeed, he was not well able to walk at all, and\npositively declared that he should never be able to make his way over\nthe gravel in pumps. His mother would not have thought half as much\nof walking from Boxall Hill to Greshamsbury and back again. At last,\nthe one village fly was sent for, and the matter was arranged.\n\nWhen they reached the house, it was easy to see that there was some\nunwonted bustle. In the drawing-room there was no one but Mr Mortimer\nGazebee, who introduced himself to them both. Sir Louis, who knew\nthat he was only an attorney, did not take much notice of him, but\nthe doctor entered into conversation.\n\n\"Have you heard that Mr Gresham has come home?\" said Mr Gazebee.\n\n\"Mr Gresham! I did not know that he had been away.\"\n\n\"Mr Gresham, junior, I mean.\" No, indeed; the doctor had not heard.\nFrank had returned unexpectedly just before dinner, and he was now\nundergoing his father's smiles, his mother's embraces, and his\nsisters' questions.\n\n\"Quite unexpectedly,\" said Mr Gazebee. \"I don't know what has brought\nhim back before his time. I suppose he found London too hot.\"\n\n\"Deuced hot,\" said the baronet. \"I found it so, at least. I don't\nknow what keeps men in London when it's so hot; except those fellows\nwho have business to do: they're paid for it.\"\n\nMr Mortimer Gazebee looked at him. He was managing an estate which\nowed Sir Louis an enormous sum of money, and, therefore, he could not\nafford to despise the baronet; but he thought to himself, what a very\nabject fellow the man would be if he were not a baronet, and had not\na large fortune!\n\nAnd then the squire came in. His broad, honest face was covered with\na smile when he saw the doctor.\n\n\"Thorne,\" he said, almost in a whisper, \"you're the best fellow\nbreathing; I have hardly deserved this.\" The doctor, as he took his\nold friend's hand, could not but be glad that he had followed Mary's\ncounsel.\n\n\"So Frank has come home?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; quite unexpectedly. He was to have stayed a week longer in\nLondon. You would hardly know him if you met him. Sir Louis, I beg\nyour pardon.\" And the squire went up to his other guest, who had\nremained somewhat sullenly standing in one corner of the room. He was\nthe man of highest rank present, or to be present, and he expected to\nbe treated as such.\n\n\"I am happy to have the pleasure of making your acquaintance,\nMr Gresham,\" said the baronet, intending to be very courteous.\n\"Though we have not met before, I very often see your name in my\naccounts--ha! ha! ha!\" and Sir Louis laughed as though he had said\nsomething very good.\n\nThe meeting between Lady Arabella and the doctor was rather\ndistressing to the former; but she managed to get over it. She shook\nhands with him graciously, and said that it was a fine day. The\ndoctor said that it was fine, only perhaps a little rainy. And then\nthey went into different parts of the room.\n\nWhen Frank came in, the doctor hardly did know him. His hair was\ndarker than it had been, and so was his complexion; but his chief\ndisguise was in a long silken beard, which hung down over his cravat.\nThe doctor had hitherto not been much in favour of long beards, but\nhe could not deny that Frank looked very well with the appendage.\n\n\"Oh, doctor, I am so delighted to find you here,\" said he, coming up\nto him; \"so very, very glad:\" and, taking the doctor's arm, he led\nhim away into a window, where they were alone. \"And how is Mary?\"\nsaid he, almost in a whisper. \"Oh, I wish she were here! But, doctor,\nit shall all come in time. But tell me, doctor, there is no news\nabout her, is there?\"\n\n\"News--what news?\"\n\n\"Oh, well; no news is good news: you will give her my love, won't\nyou?\"\n\nThe doctor said that he would. What else could he say? It appeared\nquite clear to him that some of Mary's fears were groundless.\n\nFrank was again very much altered. It has been said, that though\nhe was a boy at twenty-one, he was a man at twenty-two. But now,\nat twenty-three, he appeared to be almost a man of the world. His\nmanners were easy, his voice under his control, and words were at his\ncommand: he was no longer either shy or noisy; but, perhaps, was open\nto the charge of seeming, at least, to be too conscious of his own\nmerits. He was, indeed, very handsome; tall, manly, and powerfully\nbuilt, his form was such as women's eyes have ever loved to look\nupon. \"Ah, if he would but marry money!\" said Lady Arabella to\nherself, taken up by a mother's natural admiration for her son. His\nsisters clung round him before dinner, all talking to him at once.\nHow proud a family of girls are of one, big, tall, burly brother!\n\n\"You don't mean to tell me, Frank, that you are going to eat soup\nwith that beard?\" said the squire, when they were seated round the\ntable. He had not ceased to rally his son as to this patriarchal\nadornment; but, nevertheless, any one could have seen, with half an\neye, that he was as proud of it as were the others.\n\n\"Don't I, sir? All I require is a relay of napkins for every course:\"\nand he went to work, covering it with every spoonful, as men with\nbeards always do.\n\n\"Well, if you like it!\" said the squire, shrugging his shoulders.\n\n\"But I do like it,\" said Frank.\n\n\"Oh, papa, you wouldn't have him cut it off,\" said one of the twins.\n\"It is so handsome.\"\n\n\"I should like to work it into a chair-back instead of floss-silk,\"\nsaid the other twin.\n\n\"Thank'ee, Sophy; I'll remember you for that.\"\n\n\"Doesn't it look nice, and grand, and patriarchal?\" said Beatrice,\nturning to her neighbour.\n\n\"Patriarchal, certainly,\" said Mr Oriel. \"I should grow one myself if\nI had not the fear of the archbishop before my eyes.\"\n\nWhat was next said to him was in a whisper, audible only to himself.\n\n\"Doctor, did you know Wildman of the 9th? He was left as surgeon at\nScutari for two years. Why, my beard to his is only a little down.\"\n\n\"A little way down, you mean,\" said Mr Gazebee.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Frank, resolutely set against laughing at Mr Gazebee's\npun. \"Why, his beard descends to his ankles, and he is obliged to tie\nit in a bag at night, because his feet get entangled in it when he is\nasleep!\"\n\n\"Oh, Frank!\" said one of the girls.\n\nThis was all very well for the squire, and Lady Arabella, and the\ngirls. They were all delighted to praise Frank, and talk about him.\nNeither did it come amiss to Mr Oriel and the doctor, who had both a\npersonal interest in the young hero. But Sir Louis did not like it\nat all. He was the only baronet in the room, and yet nobody took any\nnotice of him. He was seated in the post of honour, next to Lady\nArabella; but even Lady Arabella seemed to think more of her own\nson than of him. Seeing how he was ill-used, he meditated revenge;\nbut not the less did it behove him to make some effort to attract\nattention.\n\n\"Was your ladyship long in London, this season?\" said he.\n\nLady Arabella had not been in London at all this year, and it\nwas a sore subject with her. \"No,\" said she, very graciously;\n\"circumstances have kept us at home.\"\n\nSir Louis only understood one description of \"circumstances.\"\nCircumstances, in his idea, meant the want of money, and he\nimmediately took Lady Arabella's speech as a confession of poverty.\n\n\"Ah, indeed! I am very sorry for that; that must be very distressing\nto a person like your ladyship. But things are mending, perhaps?\"\n\nLady Arabella did not in the least understand him. \"Mending!\" she\nsaid, in her peculiar tone of aristocratic indifference; and then\nturned to Mr Gazebee, who was on the other side of her.\n\nSir Louis was not going to stand this. He was the first man in the\nroom, and he knew his own importance. It was not to be borne that\nLady Arabella should turn to talk to a dirty attorney, and leave him,\na baronet, to eat his dinner without notice. If nothing else would\nmove her, he would let her know who was the real owner of the\nGreshamsbury title-deeds.\n\n\"I think I saw your ladyship out to-day, taking a ride.\" Lady\nArabella had driven through the village in her pony-chair.\n\n\"I never ride,\" said she, turning her head for one moment from Mr\nGazebee.\n\n\"In the one-horse carriage, I mean, my lady. I was delighted with the\nway you whipped him up round the corner.\"\n\nWhipped him up round the corner! Lady Arabella could make no answer\nto this; so she went on talking to Mr Gazebee. Sir Louis, repulsed,\nbut not vanquished--resolved not to be vanquished by any Lady\nArabella--turned his attention to his plate for a minute or two, and\nthen recommenced.\n\n\"The honour of a glass of wine with you, Lady Arabella,\" said he.\n\n\"I never take wine at dinner,\" said Lady Arabella. The man was\nbecoming intolerable to her, and she was beginning to fear that it\nwould be necessary for her to fly the room to get rid of him.\n\nThe baronet was again silent for a moment; but he was determined not\nto be put down.\n\n\"This is a nice-looking country about here,\" said he.\n\n\"Yes; very nice,\" said Mr Gazebee, endeavouring to relieve the lady\nof the mansion.\n\n\"I hardly know which I like best; this, or my own place at Boxall\nHill. You have the advantage here in trees, and those sort of things.\nBut, as to the house, why, my box there is very comfortable, very.\nYou'd hardly know the place now, Lady Arabella, if you haven't seen\nit since my governor bought it. How much do you think he spent about\nthe house and grounds, pineries included, you know, and those sort of\nthings?\"\n\nLady Arabella shook her head.\n\n\"Now guess, my lady,\" said he. But it was not to be supposed that\nLady Arabella should guess on such a subject.\n\n\"I never guess,\" said she, with a look of ineffable disgust.\n\n\"What do you say, Mr Gazebee?\"\n\n\"Perhaps a hundred thousand pounds.\"\n\n\"What! for a house! You can't know much about money, nor yet about\nbuilding, I think, Mr Gazebee.\"\n\n\"Not much,\" said Mr Gazebee, \"as to such magnificent places as Boxall\nHill.\"\n\n\"Well, my lady, if you won't guess, I'll tell you. It cost twenty-two\nthousand four hundred and nineteen pounds four shillings and\neightpence. I've all the accounts exact. Now, that's a tidy lot of\nmoney for a house for a man to live in.\"\n\nSir Louis spoke this in a loud tone, which at least commanded the\nattention of the table. Lady Arabella, vanquished, bowed her head,\nand said that it was a large sum; Mr Gazebee went on sedulously\neating his dinner; the squire was struck momentarily dumb in the\nmiddle of a long chat with the doctor; even Mr Oriel ceased to\nwhisper; and the girls opened their eyes with astonishment. Before\nthe end of his speech, Sir Louis's voice had become very loud.\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" said Frank; \"a very tidy lot of money. I'd have\ngenerously dropped the four and eightpence if I'd been the\narchitect.\"\n\n\"It wasn't all one bill; but that's the tot. I can show the bills:\"\nand Sir Louis, well pleased with his triumph, swallowed a glass of\nwine.\n\nAlmost immediately after the cloth was removed, Lady Arabella\nescaped, and the gentlemen clustered together. Sir Louis found\nhimself next to Mr Oriel, and began to make himself agreeable.\n\n\"A very nice girl, Miss Beatrice; very nice.\"\n\nNow Mr Oriel was a modest man, and, when thus addressed as to his\nfuture wife, found it difficult to make any reply.\n\n\"You parsons always have your own luck,\" said Sir Louis. \"You get all\nthe beauty, and generally all the money, too. Not much of the latter\nin this case, though--eh?\"\n\nMr Oriel was dumbfounded. He had never said a word to any creature as\nto Beatrice's dowry; and when Mr Gresham had told him, with sorrow,\nthat his daughter's portion must be small, he had at once passed away\nfrom the subject as one that was hardly fit for conversation, even\nbetween him and his future father-in-law; and now he was abruptly\nquestioned on the subject by a man he had never before seen in his\nlife. Of course, he could make no answer.\n\n\"The squire has muddled his matters most uncommonly,\" continued Sir\nLouis, filling his glass for the second time before he passed the\nbottle. \"What do you suppose now he owes me alone; just at one lump,\nyou know?\"\n\nMr Oriel had nothing for it but to run. He could make no answer, nor\nwould he sit there to hear tidings as to Mr Gresham's embarrassments.\nSo he fairly retreated, without having said one word to his\nneighbour, finding such discretion to be the only kind of valour left\nto him.\n\n\"What, Oriel! off already?\" said the squire. \"Anything the matter?\"\n\n\"Oh, no; nothing particular. I'm not just quite--I think I'll go out\nfor a few minutes.\"\n\n\"See what it is to be in love,\" said the squire, half-whispering to\nDr Thorne. \"You're not in the same way, I hope?\"\n\nSir Louis then shifted his seat again, and found himself next to\nFrank. Mr Gazebee was opposite to him, and the doctor opposite to\nFrank.\n\n\"Parson seems peekish, I think,\" said the baronet.\n\n\"Peekish?\" said the squire, inquisitively.\n\n\"Rather down on his luck. He's decently well off himself, isn't he?\"\n\nThere was another pause, and nobody seemed inclined to answer the\nquestion.\n\n\"I mean, he's got something more than his bare living.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Frank, laughing. \"He's got what will buy him bread\nand cheese when the Rads shut up the Church:--unless, indeed, they\nshut up the Funds too.\"\n\n\"Ah, there's nothing like land,\" said Sir Louis: \"nothing like the\ndirty acres; is there, squire?\"\n\n\"Land is a very good investment, certainly,\" said Mr Gresham.\n\n\"The best going,\" said the other, who was now, as people say when\nthey mean to be good-natured, slightly under the influence of liquor.\n\"The best going--eh, Gazebee?\"\n\nMr Gazebee gathered himself up, and turned away his head, looking out\nof the window.\n\n\"You lawyers never like to give an opinion without money, ha! ha! ha!\nDo they, Mr Gresham? You and I have had to pay for plenty of them,\nand will have to pay for plenty more before they let us alone.\"\n\nHere Mr Gazebee got up, and followed Mr Oriel out of the room. He was\nnot, of course, on such intimate terms in the house as was Mr Oriel;\nbut he hoped to be forgiven by the ladies in consequence of the\nseverity of the miseries to which he was subjected. He and Mr Oriel\nwere soon to be seen through the dining-room window, walking about\nthe grounds with the two eldest Miss Greshams. And Patience Oriel,\nwho had also been of the party, was also to be seen with the twins.\nFrank looked at his father with almost a malicious smile, and began\nto think that he too might be better employed out among the walks.\nDid he think then of a former summer evening, when he had half broken\nMary's heart by walking there too lovingly with Patience Oriel?\n\nSir Louis, if he continued his brilliant career of success, would\nsoon be left the cock of the walk. The squire, to be sure, could\nnot bolt, nor could the doctor very well; but they might be equally\nvanquished, remaining there in their chairs. Dr Thorne, during all\nthis time, was sitting with tingling ears. Indeed, it may be said\nthat his whole body tingled. He was in a manner responsible for this\nhorrid scene; but what could he do to stop it? He could not take Sir\nLouis up bodily and carry him away. One idea did occur to him. The\nfly had been ordered for ten o'clock. He could rush out and send for\nit instantly.\n\n\"You're not going to leave me?\" said the squire, in a voice of\nhorror, as he saw the doctor rising from his chair.\n\n\"Oh, no, no, no,\" said the doctor; and then he whispered the purpose\nof his mission. \"I will be back in two minutes.\" The doctor would\nhave given twenty pounds to have closed the scene at once; but he was\nnot the man to desert his friend in such a strait as that.\n\n\"He's a well-meaning fellow, the doctor,\" said Sir Louis, when his\nguardian was out of the room, \"very; but he's not up to trap--not at\nall.\"\n\n\"Up to trap--well, I should say he was; that is, if I know what trap\nmeans,\" said Frank.\n\n\"Ah, but that's just the ticket. Do you know? Now I say Dr Thorne's\nnot a man of the world.\"\n\n\"He's about the best man I know, or ever heard of,\" said the squire.\n\"And if any man ever had a good friend, you have got one in him; and\nso have I:\" and the squire silently drank the doctor's health.\n\n\"All very true, I dare say; but yet he's not up to trap. Now look\nhere, squire--\"\n\n\"If you don't mind, sir,\" said Frank, \"I've got something very\nparticular--perhaps, however--\"\n\n\"Stay till Thorne returns, Frank.\"\n\nFrank did stay till Thorne returned, and then escaped.\n\n\"Excuse me, doctor,\" said he, \"but I've something very particular to\nsay; I'll explain to-morrow.\" And then the three were left alone.\n\nSir Louis was now becoming almost drunk, and was knocking his words\ntogether. The squire had already attempted to stop the bottle; but\nthe baronet had contrived to get hold of a modicum of Madeira, and\nthere was no preventing him from helping himself; at least, none at\nthat moment.\n\n\"As we were saying about lawyers,\" continued Sir Louis. \"Let's see,\nwhat were we saying? Why, squire, it's just here. Those fellows will\nfleece us both if we don't mind what we are after.\"\n\n\"Never mind about lawyers now,\" said Dr Thorne, angrily.\n\n\"Ah, but I do mind; most particularly. That's all very well for you,\ndoctor; you've nothing to lose. You've no great stake in the matter.\nWhy, now, what sum of money of mine do you think those d---- doctors\nare handling?\"\n\n\"D---- doctors!\" said the squire in a tone of dismay.\n\n\"Lawyers, I mean, of course. Why, now, Gresham; we're all totted\nnow, you see; you're down in my books, I take it, for pretty near a\nhundred thousand pounds.\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue, sir,\" said the doctor, getting up.\n\n\"Hold my tongue!\" said Sir Louis.\n\n\"Sir Louis Scatcherd,\" said the squire, slowly rising from his chair,\n\"we will not, if you please, talk about business at the present\nmoment. Perhaps we had better go to the ladies.\"\n\nThis latter proposition had certainly not come from the squire's\nheart: going to the ladies was the very last thing for which Sir\nLouis was now fit. But the squire had said it as being the only\nrecognised formal way he could think of for breaking up the\nsymposium.\n\n\"Oh, very well,\" hiccupped the baronet, \"I'm always ready for the\nladies,\" and he stretched out his hand to the decanter to get a last\nglass of Madeira.\n\n\"No,\" said the doctor, rising stoutly, and speaking with a determined\nvoice. \"No; you will have no more wine:\" and he took the decanter\nfrom him.\n\n\"What's all this about?\" said Sir Louis, with a drunken laugh.\n\n\"Of course he cannot go into the drawing-room, Mr Gresham. If you\nwill leave him here with me, I will stay with him till the fly\ncomes. Pray tell Lady Arabella from me, how sorry I am that this has\noccurred.\"\n\nThe squire would not leave his friend, and they sat together till the\nfly came. It was not long, for the doctor had dispatched his\nmessenger with much haste.\n\n\"I am so heartily ashamed of myself,\" said the doctor, almost with\ntears.\n\nThe squire took him by the hand affectionately. \"I've seen a tipsy\nman before to-night,\" said he.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the doctor, \"and so have I, but--\" He did not express the\nrest of his thoughts.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI\n\nWill He Come Again?\n\n\nLong before the doctor returned home after the little dinner-party\nabove described, Mary had learnt that Frank was already at\nGreshamsbury. She had heard nothing of him or from him, not a word,\nnothing in the shape of a message, for twelve months; and at her age\ntwelve months is a long period. Would he come and see her in spite of\nhis mother? Would he send her any tidings of his return, or notice\nher in any way? If he did not, what would she do? and if he did, what\nthen would she do? It was so hard to resolve; so hard to be deserted;\nand so hard to dare to wish that she might not be deserted! She\ncontinued to say to herself, that it would be better that they should\nbe strangers; and she could hardly keep herself from tears in the\nfear that they might be so. What chance could there be that he should\ncare for her, after an absence spent in travelling over the world?\nNo; she would forget that affair of his hand; and then, immediately\nafter having so determined, she would confess to herself that it was\na thing not to be forgotten, and impossible of oblivion.\n\nOn her uncle's return, she would hear some word about him; and so\nshe sat alone, with a book before her, of which she could not read\na line. She expected them about eleven, and was, therefore, rather\nsurprised when the fly stopped at the door before nine.\n\nShe immediately heard her uncle's voice, loud and angry, calling\nfor Thomas. Both Thomas and Bridget were unfortunately out, being,\nat this moment, forgetful of all sublunary cares, and seated in\nhappiness under a beech-tree in the park. Janet flew to the little\ngate, and there found Sir Louis insisting that he would be taken at\nonce to his own mansion at Boxall Hill, and positively swearing that\nhe would no longer submit to the insult of the doctor's surveillance.\n\nIn the absence of Thomas, the doctor was forced to apply for\nassistance to the driver of the fly. Between them the baronet was\ndragged out of the vehicle, the windows suffered much, and the\ndoctor's hat also. In this way, he was taken upstairs, and was at\nlast put to bed, Janet assisting; nor did the doctor leave the room\ntill his guest was asleep. Then he went into the drawing-room to\nMary. It may easily be conceived that he was hardly in a humour to\ntalk much about Frank Gresham.\n\n\"What am I to do with him?\" said he, almost in tears: \"what am I to\ndo with him?\"\n\n\"Can you not send him to Boxall Hill?\" asked Mary.\n\n\"Yes; to kill himself there! But it is no matter; he will kill\nhimself somewhere. Oh! what that family have done for me!\" And then,\nsuddenly remembering a portion of their doings, he took Mary in his\narms, and kissed and blessed her; and declared that, in spite of all\nthis, he was a happy man.\n\nThere was no word about Frank that night. The next morning the doctor\nfound Sir Louis very weak, and begging for stimulants. He was worse\nthan weak; he was in such a state of wretched misery and mental\nprostration; so low in heart, in such collapse of energy and spirit,\nthat Dr Thorne thought it prudent to remove his razors from his\nreach.\n\n\"For God's sake do let me have a little _chasse-caf\u00c3\u00a9_; I'm always\nused to it; ask Joe if I'm not! You don't want to kill me, do you?\"\nAnd the baronet cried piteously, like a child, and, when the doctor\nleft him for the breakfast-table, abjectly implored Janet to get him\nsome cura\u00c3\u00a7oa which he knew was in one of his portmanteaus. Janet,\nhowever, was true to her master.\n\nThe doctor did give him some wine; and then, having left strict\norders as to his treatment--Bridget and Thomas being now both in the\nhouse--went forth to some of his too much neglected patients.\n\nThen Mary was again alone, and her mind flew away to her lover. How\nshould she be able to compose herself when she should first see him?\nSee him she must. People cannot live in the same village without\nmeeting. If she passed him at the church-door, as she often passed\nLady Arabella, what should she do? Lady Arabella always smiled\na peculiar, little, bitter smile, and this, with half a nod of\nrecognition, carried off the meeting. Should she try the bitter\nsmile, the half-nod with Frank? Alas! she knew it was not in her to\nbe so much mistress of her own heart's blood.\n\nAs she thus thought, she stood at the drawing-room window, looking\nout into her garden; and, as she leant against the sill, her head was\nsurrounded by the sweet creepers. \"At any rate, he won't come here,\"\nshe said: and so, with a deep sigh, she turned from the window into\nthe room.\n\nThere he was, Frank Gresham himself standing there in her immediate\npresence, beautiful as Apollo. Her next thought was how she might\nescape from out of his arms. How it happened that she had fallen into\nthem, she never knew.\n\n\"Mary! my own, own love! my own one! sweetest! dearest! best! Mary!\ndear Mary! have you not a word to say to me?\"\n\nNo; she had not a word, though her life had depended on it. The\nexertion necessary for not crying was quite enough for her. This,\nthen, was the bitter smile and the half-nod that was to pass between\nthem; this was the manner in which estrangement was to grow into\nindifference; this was the mode of meeting by which she was to prove\nthat she was mistress of her conduct, if not her heart! There he held\nher close bound to his breast, and she could only protect her face,\nand that all ineffectually, with her hands. \"He loves another,\"\nBeatrice had said. \"At any rate, he will not love me,\" her own heart\nhad said also. Here was now the answer.\n\n\"You know you cannot marry him,\" Beatrice had said, also. Ah! if that\nreally were so, was not this embrace deplorable for them both? And\nyet how could she not be happy? She endeavoured to repel him; but\nwith what a weak endeavour! Her pride had been wounded to the core,\nnot by Lady Arabella's scorn, but by the conviction which had grown\non her, that though she had given her own heart absolutely away,\nhad parted with it wholly and for ever, she had received nothing in\nreturn. The world, her world, would know that she had loved, and\nloved in vain. But here now was the loved one at her feet; the first\nmoment that his enforced banishment was over, had brought him there.\nHow could she not be happy?\n\nThey all said that she could not marry him. Well, perhaps it might\nbe so; nay, when she thought of it, must not that edict too probably\nbe true? But if so, it would not be his fault. He was true to her,\nand that satisfied her pride. He had taken from her, by surprise,\na confession of her love. She had often regretted her weakness in\nallowing him to do so; but she could not regret it now. She could\nendure to suffer; nay, it would not be suffering while he suffered\nwith her.\n\n\"Not one word, Mary? Then after all my dreams, after all my patience,\nyou do not love me at last?\"\n\nOh, Frank! notwithstanding what has been said in thy praise, what a\nfool thou art! Was any word necessary for thee? Had not her heart\nbeat against thine? Had she not borne thy caresses? Had there been\none touch of anger when she warded off thy threatened kisses?\nBridget, in the kitchen, when Jonah became amorous, smashed his nose\nwith the rolling-pin. But when Thomas sinned, perhaps as deeply, she\nonly talked of doing so. Miss Thorne, in the drawing-room, had she\nneeded self-protection, could doubtless have found the means, though\nthe process would probably have been less violent.\n\nAt last Mary succeeded in her efforts at enfranchisement, and she and\nFrank stood at some little distance from each other. She could not\nbut marvel at him. That long, soft beard, which just now had been so\nclose to her face, was all new; his whole look was altered; his mien,\nand gait, and very voice were not the same. Was this, indeed, the\nvery Frank who had chattered of his boyish love, two years since, in\nthe gardens at Greshamsbury?\n\n\"Not one word of welcome, Mary?\"\n\n\"Indeed, Mr Gresham, you are welcome home.\"\n\n\"Mr Gresham! Tell me, Mary--tell me, at once--has anything happened?\nI could not ask up there.\"\n\n\"Frank,\" she said, and then stopped; not being able at the moment to\nget any further.\n\n\"Speak to me honestly, Mary; honestly and bravely. I offered you my\nhand once before; there it is again. Will you take it?\"\n\nShe looked wistfully up in his eyes; she would fain have taken it.\nBut though a girl may be honest in such a case, it is so hard for her\nto be brave.\n\nHe still held out his hand. \"Mary,\" said he, \"if you can value it,\nit shall be yours through good fortune or ill fortune. There may be\ndifficulties; but if you can love me, we will get over them. I am a\nfree man; free to do as I please with myself, except so far as I am\nbound to you. There is my hand. Will you have it?\" And then he, too,\nlooked into her eyes, and waited composedly, as though determined to\nhave an answer.\n\nShe slowly raised her hand, and, as she did so, her eyes fell to the\nground. It then drooped again, and was again raised; and, at last,\nher light tapering fingers rested on his broad open palm.\n\nThey were soon clutched, and the whole hand brought absolutely within\nhis grasp. \"There, now you are my own!\" he said, \"and none of them\nshall part us; my own Mary, my own wife.\"\n\n\"Oh, Frank, is not this imprudent? Is it not wrong?\"\n\n\"Imprudent! I am sick of prudence. I hate prudence. And as for\nwrong--no. I say it is not wrong; certainly not wrong if we love each\nother. And you do love me, Mary--eh? You do! don't you?\"\n\nHe would not excuse her, or allow her to escape from saying it in so\nmany words; and when the words did come at last, they came freely.\n\"Yes, Frank, I do love you; if that were all you would have no cause\nfor fear.\"\n\n\"And I will have no cause for fear.\"\n\n\"Ah; but your father, Frank, and my uncle. I can never bring myself\nto do anything that shall bring either of them to sorrow.\"\n\nFrank, of course, ran through all his arguments. He would go into a\nprofession, or take a farm and live in it. He would wait; that is,\nfor a few months. \"A few months, Frank!\" said Mary. \"Well, perhaps\nsix.\" \"Oh, Frank!\" But Frank would not be stopped. He would do\nanything that his father might ask him. Anything but the one thing.\nHe would not give up the wife he had chosen. It would not be\nreasonable, or proper, or righteous that he should be asked to do so;\nand here he mounted a somewhat high horse.\n\nMary had no arguments which she could bring from her heart to offer\nin opposition to all this. She could only leave her hand in his, and\nfeel that she was happier than she had been at any time since the day\nof that donkey-ride at Boxall Hill.\n\n\"But, Mary,\" continued he, becoming very grave and serious. \"We must\nbe true to each other, and firm in this. Nothing that any of them can\nsay shall drive me from my purpose; will you say as much?\"\n\nHer hand was still in his, and so she stood, thinking for a moment\nbefore she answered him. But she could not do less for him than he\nwas willing to do for her. \"Yes,\" said she--said in a very low voice,\nand with a manner perfectly quiet--\"I will be firm. Nothing that they\ncan say shall shake me. But, Frank, it cannot be soon.\"\n\nNothing further occurred in this interview which needs recording.\nFrank had been three times told by Mary that he had better go before\nhe did go; and, at last, she was obliged to take the matter into her\nown hands, and lead him to the door.\n\n\"You are in a great hurry to get rid of me,\" said he.\n\n\"You have been here two hours, and you must go now; what will they\nall think?\"\n\n\"Who cares what they think? Let them think the truth: that after a\nyear's absence, I have much to say to you.\" However, at last, he did\ngo, and Mary was left alone.\n\nFrank, although he had been so slow to move, had a thousand other\nthings to do, and went about them at once. He was very much in love,\nno doubt; but that did not interfere with his interest in other\npursuits. In the first place, he had to see Harry Baker, and Harry\nBaker's stud. Harry had been specially charged to look after the\nblack horse during Frank's absence, and the holiday doings of\nthat valuable animal had to be inquired into. Then the kennel of\nthe hounds had to be visited, and--as a matter of second-rate\nimportance--the master. This could not be done on the same day; but a\nplan for doing so must be concocted with Harry--and then there were\ntwo young pointer pups.\n\nFrank, when he left his betrothed, went about these things quite as\nvehemently as though he were not in love at all; quite as vehemently\nas though he had said nothing as to going into some profession which\nmust necessarily separate him from horses and dogs. But Mary sat\nthere at her window, thinking of her love, and thinking of nothing\nelse. It was all in all to her now. She had pledged herself not to be\nshaken from her troth by anything, by any person; and it would behove\nher to be true to this pledge. True to it, though all the Greshams\nbut one should oppose her with all their power; true to it, even\nthough her own uncle should oppose her.\n\nAnd how could she have done any other than so pledge herself, invoked\nto it as she had been? How could she do less for him than he was so\nanxious to do for her? They would talk to her of maiden delicacy, and\ntell her that she had put a stain on that snow-white coat of proof,\nin confessing her love for one whose friends were unwilling to\nreceive her. Let them so talk. Honour, honesty, and truth, out-spoken\ntruth, self-denying truth, and fealty from man to man, are worth more\nthan maiden delicacy; more, at any rate, than the talk of it. It\nwas not for herself that this pledge had been made. She knew her\nposition, and the difficulties of it; she knew also the value of it.\nHe had much to offer, much to give; she had nothing but herself. He\nhad name, and old repute, family, honour, and what eventually would\nat least be wealth to her. She was nameless, fameless, portionless.\nHe had come there with all his ardour, with the impulse of his\ncharacter, and asked for her love. It was already his own. He had\nthen demanded her troth, and she acknowledged that he had a right to\ndemand it. She would be his if ever it should be in his power to take\nher.\n\nBut there let the bargain end. She would always remember, that though\nit was in her power to keep her pledge, it might too probably not be\nin his power to keep his. That doctrine, laid down so imperatively\nby the great authorities of Greshamsbury, that edict, which demanded\nthat Frank should marry money, had come home also to her with a\ncertain force. It would be sad that the fame of Greshamsbury should\nperish, and that the glory should depart from the old house. It might\nbe, that Frank also should perceive that he must marry money. It\nwould be a pity that he had not seen it sooner; but she, at any rate,\nwould not complain.\n\nAnd so she stood, leaning on the open window, with her book unnoticed\nlying beside her. The sun had been in the mid-sky when Frank had left\nher, but its rays were beginning to stream into the room from the\nwest before she moved from her position. Her first thought in the\nmorning had been this: Would he come to see her? Her last now was\nmore soothing to her, less full of absolute fear: Would it be right\nthat he should come again?\n\nThe first sounds she heard were the footsteps of her uncle, as he\ncame up to the drawing-room, three steps at a time. His step was\nalways heavy; but when he was disturbed in spirit, it was slow; when\nmerely fatigued in body by ordinary work, it was quick.\n\n\"What a broiling day!\" he said, and he threw himself into a chair.\n\"For mercy's sake give me something to drink.\" Now the doctor was a\ngreat man for summer-drinks. In his house, lemonade, currant-juice,\norange-mixtures, and raspberry-vinegar were used by the quart. He\nfrequently disapproved of these things for his patients, as being apt\nto disarrange the digestion; but he consumed enough himself to throw\na large family into such difficulties.\n\n\"Ha--a!\" he ejaculated, after a draught; \"I'm better now. Well,\nwhat's the news?\"\n\n\"You've been out, uncle; you ought to have the news. How's Mrs\nGreen?\"\n\n\"Really as bad as ennui and solitude can make her.\"\n\n\"And Mrs Oaklerath?\"\n\n\"She's getting better, because she has ten children to look after,\nand twins to suckle. What has he been doing?\" And the doctor pointed\ntowards the room occupied by Sir Louis.\n\nMary's conscience struck her that she had not even asked. She had\nhardly remembered, during the whole day, that the baronet was in the\nhouse. \"I do not think he has been doing much,\" she said. \"Janet has\nbeen with him all day.\"\n\n\"Has he been drinking?\"\n\n\"Upon my word, I don't know, uncle. I think not, for Janet has been\nwith him. But, uncle--\"\n\n\"Well, dear--but just give me a little more of that tipple.\"\n\nMary prepared the tumbler, and, as she handed it to him, she said,\n\"Frank Gresham has been here to-day.\"\n\nThe doctor swallowed his draught, and put down the glass before he\nmade any reply, and even then he said but little.\n\n\"Oh! Frank Gresham.\"\n\n\"Yes, uncle.\"\n\n\"You thought him looking pretty well?\"\n\n\"Yes, uncle; he was very well, I believe.\"\n\nDr Thorne had nothing more to say, so he got up and went to his\npatient in the next room.\n\n\"If he disapproves of it, why does he not say so?\" said Mary to\nherself. \"Why does he not advise me?\"\n\nBut it was not so easy to give advice while Sir Louis Scatcherd was\nlying there in that state.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII\n\nSir Louis Leaves Greshamsbury\n\n\nJanet had been sedulous in her attentions to Sir Louis, and had not\ntroubled her mistress; but she had not had an easy time of it. Her\norders had been, that either she or Thomas should remain in the room\nthe whole day, and those orders had been obeyed.\n\nImmediately after breakfast, the baronet had inquired after his own\nservant. \"His confounded nose must be right by this time, I suppose?\"\n\n\"It was very bad, Sir Louis,\" said the old woman, who imagined that\nit might be difficult to induce Jonah to come into the house again.\n\n\"A man in such a place as his has no business to be laid up,\" said\nthe master, with a whine. \"I'll see and get a man who won't break his\nnose.\"\n\nThomas was sent to the inn three or four times, but in vain. The man\nwas sitting up, well enough, in the tap-room; but the middle of his\nface was covered with streaks of plaster, and he could not bring\nhimself to expose his wounds before his conqueror.\n\nSir Louis began by ordering the woman to bring him _chasse-caf\u00c3\u00a9_. She\noffered him coffee, as much as he would; but no _chasse_. \"A glass of\nport wine,\" she said, \"at twelve o'clock, and another at three had\nbeen ordered for him.\"\n\n\"I don't care a ---- for the orders,\" said Sir Louis; \"send me my\nown man.\" The man was again sent for; but would not come. \"There's\na bottle of that stuff that I take, in that portmanteau, in the\nleft-hand corner--just hand it to me.\"\n\nBut Janet was not to be done. She would give him no stuff, except\nwhat the doctor had ordered, till the doctor came back. The doctor\nwould then, no doubt, give him anything that was proper.\n\nSir Louis swore a good deal, and stormed as much as he could. He\ndrank, however, his two glasses of wine, and he got no more. Once or\ntwice he essayed to get out of bed and dress; but, at every effort,\nhe found that he could not do it without Joe: and there he was, still\nunder the clothes when the doctor returned.\n\n\"I'll tell you what it is,\" said he, as soon as his guardian entered\nthe room, \"I'm not going to be made a prisoner of here.\"\n\n\"A prisoner! no, surely not.\"\n\n\"It seems very much like it at present. Your servant here--that\nold woman--takes it upon her to say she'll do nothing without your\norders.\"\n\n\"Well; she's right there.\"\n\n\"Right! I don't know what you call right; but I won't stand it. You\nare not going to make a child of me, Dr Thorne; so you need not think\nit.\"\n\nAnd then there was a long quarrel between them, and but an\nindifferent reconciliation. The baronet said that he would go to\nBoxall Hill, and was vehement in his intention to do so because the\ndoctor opposed it. He had not, however, as yet ferreted out the\nsquire, or given a bit of his mind to Mr Gazebee, and it behoved him\nto do this before he took himself off to his own country mansion. He\nended, therefore, by deciding to go on the next day but one.\n\n\"Let it be so, if you are well enough,\" said the doctor.\n\n\"Well enough!\" said the other, with a sneer. \"There's nothing to make\nme ill that I know of. It certainly won't be drinking too much here.\"\n\nOn the next day, Sir Louis was in a different mood, and in one more\ndistressing for the doctor to bear. His compelled abstinence from\nintemperate drinking had, no doubt, been good for him; but his mind\nhad so much sunk under the pain of the privation, that his state was\npiteous to behold. He had cried for his servant, as a child cries\nfor its nurse, till at last the doctor, moved to pity, had himself\ngone out and brought the man in from the public-house. But when he\ndid come, Joe was of but little service to his master, as he was\naltogether prevented from bringing him either wine or spirits; and\nwhen he searched for the liqueur-case, he found that even that had\nbeen carried away.\n\n\"I believe you want me to die,\" he said, as the doctor, sitting\nby his bedside, was trying, for the hundredth time, to make him\nunderstand that he had but one chance of living.\n\nThe doctor was not the least irritated. It would have been as wise to\nbe irritated by the want of reason in a dog.\n\n\"I am doing what I can to save your life,\" he said calmly; \"but, as\nyou said just now, I have no power over you. As long as you are able\nto move and remain in my house, you certainly shall not have the\nmeans of destroying yourself. You will be very wise to stay here\nfor a week or ten days: a week or ten days of healthy living might,\nperhaps, bring you round.\"\n\nSir Louis again declared that the doctor wished him to die, and spoke\nof sending for his attorney, Finnie, to come to Greshamsbury to look\nafter him.\n\n\"Send for him if you choose,\" said the doctor. \"His coming will cost\nyou three or four pounds, but can do no other harm.\"\n\n\"And I will send for Fillgrave,\" threatened the baronet. \"I'm not\ngoing to die here like a dog.\"\n\nIt was certainly hard upon Dr Thorne that he should be obliged to\nentertain such a guest in the house;--to entertain him, and foster\nhim, and care for him, almost as though he were a son. But he had no\nalternative; he had accepted the charge from Sir Roger, and he must\ngo through with it. His conscience, moreover, allowed him no rest in\nthis matter: it harassed him day and night, driving him on sometimes\nto great wretchedness. He could not love this incubus that was on his\nshoulders; he could not do other than be very far from loving him. Of\nwhat use or value was he to any one? What could the world make of him\nthat would be good, or he of the world? Was not an early death his\ncertain fate? The earlier it might be, would it not be the better?\n\nWere he to linger on yet for two years longer--and such a space of\nlife was possible for him--how great would be the mischief that he\nmight do; nay, certainly would do! Farewell then to all hopes for\nGreshamsbury, as far as Mary was concerned. Farewell then to that\ndear scheme which lay deep in the doctor's heart, that hope that he\nmight, in his niece's name, give back to the son the lost property of\nthe father. And might not one year--six months be as fatal. Frank,\nthey all said, must marry money; and even he--he the doctor himself,\nmuch as he despised the idea for money's sake--even he could not but\nconfess that Frank, as the heir to an old, but grievously embarrassed\nproperty, had no right to marry, at his early age, a girl without\na shilling. Mary, his niece, his own child, would probably be the\nheiress of this immense wealth; but he could not tell this to Frank;\nno, nor to Frank's father while Sir Louis was yet alive. What, if by\nso doing he should achieve this marriage for his niece, and that then\nSir Louis should live to dispose of his own? How then would he face\nthe anger of Lady Arabella?\n\n\"I will never hanker after a dead man's shoes, neither for myself nor\nfor another,\" he had said to himself a hundred times; and as often\ndid he accuse himself of doing so. One path, however, was plainly\nopen before him. He would keep his peace as to the will; and would\nuse such efforts as he might use for a son of his own loins to\npreserve the life that was so valueless. His wishes, his hopes,\nhis thoughts, he could not control; but his conduct was at his own\ndisposal.\n\n\"I say, doctor, you don't really think that I'm going to die?\" Sir\nLouis said, when Dr Thorne again visited him.\n\n\"I don't think at all; I am sure you will kill yourself if you\ncontinue to live as you have lately done.\"\n\n\"But suppose I go all right for a while, and live--live just as you\ntell me, you know?\"\n\n\"All of us are in God's hands, Sir Louis. By so doing you will, at\nany rate, give yourself the best chance.\"\n\n\"Best chance? Why, d----n, doctor! there are fellows have done ten\ntimes worse than I; and they are not going to kick. Come, now, I know\nyou are trying to frighten me; ain't you, now?\"\n\n\"I am trying to do the best I can for you.\"\n\n\"It's very hard on a fellow like me; I have nobody to say a kind word\nto me; no, not one.\" And Sir Louis, in his wretchedness, began to\nweep. \"Come, doctor; if you'll put me once more on my legs, I'll let\nyou draw on the estate for five hundred pounds; by G----, I will.\"\n\nThe doctor went away to his dinner, and the baronet also had his in\nbed. He could not eat much, but he was allowed two glasses of wine,\nand also a little brandy in his coffee. This somewhat invigorated\nhim, and when Dr Thorne again went to him, in the evening, he did not\nfind him so utterly prostrated in spirit. He had, indeed, made up his\nmind to a great resolve; and thus unfolded his final scheme for his\nown reformation:--\n\n\"Doctor,\" he began again, \"I believe you are an honest fellow; I do\nindeed.\"\n\nDr Thorne could not but thank him for his good opinion.\n\n\"You ain't annoyed at what I said this morning, are you?\"\n\nThe doctor had forgotten the particular annoyance to which Sir Louis\nalluded; and informed him that his mind might be at rest on any such\nmatter.\n\n\"I do believe you'd be glad to see me well; wouldn't you, now?\"\n\nThe doctor assured him that such was in very truth the case.\n\n\"Well, now, I'll tell you what: I've been thinking about it a great\ndeal to-day; indeed, I have, and I want to do what's right. Mightn't\nI have a little drop more of that stuff, just in a cup of coffee?\"\n\nThe doctor poured him out a cup of coffee, and put about a\nteaspoonful of brandy in it. Sir Louis took it with a disconsolate\nface, not having been accustomed to such measures in the use of his\nfavourite beverage.\n\n\"I do wish to do what's right--I do, indeed; only, you see, I'm so\nlonely. As to those fellows up in London, I don't think that one of\nthem cares a straw about me.\"\n\nDr Thorne was of the same way of thinking, and he said so. He could\nnot but feel some sympathy with the unfortunate man as he thus spoke\nof his own lot. It was true that he had been thrown on the world\nwithout any one to take care of him.\n\n\"My dear friend, I will do the best I can in every way; I will,\nindeed. I do believe that your companions in town have been too ready\nto lead you astray. Drop them, and you may yet do well.\"\n\n\"May I though, doctor? Well, I will drop them. There's Jenkins; he's\nthe best of them; but even he is always wanting to make money of me.\nNot but what I'm up to the best of them in that way.\"\n\n\"You had better leave London, Sir Louis, and change your old mode of\nlife. Go to Boxall Hill for a while; for two or three years or so;\nlive with your mother there and take to farming.\"\n\n\"What! farming?\"\n\n\"Yes; that's what all country gentlemen do: take the land there into\nyour own hand, and occupy your mind upon it.\"\n\n\"Well, doctor, I will--upon one condition.\"\n\nDr Thorne sat still and listened. He had no idea what the condition\nmight be, but he was not prepared to promise acquiescence till he\nheard it.\n\n\"You know what I told you once before,\" said the baronet.\n\n\"I don't remember at this moment.\"\n\n\"About my getting married, you know.\"\n\nThe doctor's brow grew black, and promised no help to the poor\nwretch. Bad in every way, wretched, selfish, sensual, unfeeling,\npurse-proud, ignorant as Sir Louis Scatcherd was, still, there was\nleft to him the power of feeling something like sincere love. It may\nbe presumed that he did love Mary Thorne, and that he was at the time\nearnest in declaring, that if she could be given to him, he would\nendeavour to live according to her uncle's counsel. It was only a\ntrifle he asked; but, alas! that trifle could not be vouchsafed.\n\n\"I should much approve of your getting married, but I do not know how\nI can help you.\"\n\n\"Of course, I mean to Miss Mary: I do love her; I really do, Dr\nThorne.\"\n\n\"It is quite impossible, Sir Louis; quite. You do my niece much\nhonour; but I am able to answer for her, positively, that such a\nproposition is quite out of the question.\"\n\n\"Look here now, Dr Thorne; anything in the way of settlements--\"\n\n\"I will not hear a word on the subject: you are very welcome to the\nuse of my house as long as it may suit you to remain here; but I must\ninsist that my niece shall not be troubled on this matter.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say she's in love with that young Gresham?\"\n\nThis was too much for the doctor's patience. \"Sir Louis,\" said he,\n\"I can forgive you much for your father's sake. I can also forgive\nsomething on the score of your own ill health. But you ought to know,\nyou ought by this time to have learnt, that there are some things\nwhich a man cannot forgive. I will not talk to you about my niece;\nand remember this, also, I will not have her troubled by you:\" and,\nso saying, the doctor left him.\n\nOn the next day the baronet was sufficiently recovered to be able to\nresume his braggadocio airs. He swore at Janet; insisted on being\nserved by his own man; demanded in a loud voice, but in vain,\nthat his liqueur-case should be restored to him; and desired that\npost-horses might be ready for him on the morrow. On that day he\ngot up and ate his dinner in his bedroom. On the next morning he\ncountermanded the horses, informing the doctor that he did so because\nhe had a little bit of business to transact with Squire Gresham\nbefore he left the place! With some difficulty, the doctor made him\nunderstand that the squire would not see him on business; and it was\nat last decided, that Mr Gazebee should be invited to call on him at\nthe doctor's house; and this Mr Gazebee agreed to do, in order to\nprevent the annoyance of having the baronet up at Greshamsbury.\n\nOn this day, the evening before Mr Gazebee's visit, Sir Louis\ncondescended to come down to dinner. He dined, however, _t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aate_\nwith the doctor. Mary was not there, nor was anything said as to her\nabsence. Sir Louis Scatcherd never set eyes upon her again.\n\nHe bore himself very arrogantly on that evening, having resumed the\nairs and would-be dignity which he thought belonged to him as a man\nof rank and property. In his periods of low spirits, he was abject\nand humble enough; abject, and fearful of the lamentable destiny\nwhich at these moments he believed to be in store for him. But it\nwas one of the peculiar symptoms of his state, that as he partially\nrecovered his bodily health, the tone of his mind recovered itself\nalso, and his fears for the time were relieved.\n\nThere was very little said between him and the doctor that evening.\nThe doctor sat guarding the wine, and thinking when he should have\nhis house to himself again. Sir Louis sat moody, every now and then\nuttering some impertinence as to the Greshams and the Greshamsbury\nproperty, and, at an early hour, allowed Joe to put him to bed.\n\nThe horses were ordered on the next day for three, and, at two, Mr\nGazebee came to the house. He had never been there before, nor had he\never met Dr Thorne except at the squire's dinner. On this occasion he\nasked only for the baronet.\n\n\"Ah! ah! I'm glad you're come, Mr Gazebee; very glad,\" said Sir\nLouis; acting the part of the rich, great man with all the power he\nhad. \"I want to ask you a few questions so as to make it all clear\nsailing between us.\"\n\n\"As you have asked to see me, I have come, Sir Louis,\" said the\nother, putting on much dignity as he spoke. \"But would it not be\nbetter that any business there may be should be done among the\nlawyers?\"\n\n\"The lawyers are very well, I dare say; but when a man has so large a\nstake at interest as I have in this Greshamsbury property, why, you\nsee, Mr Gazebee, he feels a little inclined to look after it himself.\nNow, do you know, Mr Gazebee, how much it is that Mr Gresham owes\nme?\"\n\nMr Gazebee, of course, did know very well; but he was not going to\ndiscuss the subject with Sir Louis, if he could help it.\n\n\"Whatever claim your father's estate may have on that of Mr Gresham\nis, as far as I understand, vested in Dr Thorne's hands as trustee.\nI am inclined to believe that you have not yourself at present any\nclaim on Greshamsbury. The interest, as it becomes due, is paid to\nDr Thorne; and if I may be allowed to make a suggestion, I would say\nthat it will not be expedient to make any change in that arrangement\ntill the property shall come into your own hands.\"\n\n\"I differ from you entirely, Mr Gazebee; _in toto_, as we used to say\nat Eton. What you mean to say is--I can't go to law with Mr Gresham;\nI'm not so sure of that; but perhaps not. But I can compel Dr Thorne\nto look after my interests. I can force him to foreclose. And to tell\nyou the truth, Gazebee, unless some arrangement is proposed to me\nwhich I shall think advantageous, I shall do so at once. There is\nnear a hundred thousand pounds owing to me; yes to me. Thorne is only\na name in the matter. The money is my money; and, by ----, I mean to\nlook after it.\"\n\n\"Have you any doubt, Sir Louis, as to the money being secure?\"\n\n\"Yes, I have. It isn't so easy to have a hundred thousand pounds\nsecured. The squire is a poor man, and I don't choose to allow a poor\nman to owe me such a sum as that. Besides, I mean to invest it in\nland. I tell you fairly, therefore, I shall foreclose.\"\n\nMr Gazebee, using all the perspicuity which his professional\neducation had left to him, tried to make Sir Louis understand that he\nhad no power to do anything of the kind.\n\n\"No power! Mr Gresham shall see whether I have no power. When a man\nhas a hundred thousand pounds owing to him he ought to have some\npower; and, as I take it, he has. But we will see. Perhaps you know\nFinnie, do you?\"\n\nMr Gazebee, with a good deal of scorn in his face, said that he had\nnot that pleasure. Mr Finnie was not in his line.\n\n\"Well, you will know him then, and you'll find he's sharp enough;\nthat is, unless I have some offer made to me that I may choose to\naccept.\" Mr Gazebee declared that he was not instructed to make any\noffer, and so he took his leave.\n\nOn that afternoon, Sir Louis went off to Boxall Hill, transferring\nthe miserable task of superintending his self-destruction from the\nshoulders of the doctor to those of his mother. Of Lady Scatcherd,\nthe baronet took no account in his proposed sojourn in the country,\nnor did he take much of the doctor in leaving Greshamsbury. He again\nwrapped himself in his furs, and, with tottering steps, climbed up\ninto the barouche which was to carry him away.\n\n\"Is my man up behind?\" he said to Janet, while the doctor was\nstanding at the little front garden-gate, making his adieux.\n\n\"No, sir, he's not up yet,\" said Janet, respectfully.\n\n\"Then send him out, will you? I can't lose my time waiting here all\nday.\"\n\n\"I shall come over to Boxall Hill and see you,\" said the doctor,\nwhose heart softened towards the man, in spite of his brutality, as\nthe hour of his departure came.\n\n\"I shall be happy to see you if you like to come, of course; that is,\nin the way of visiting, and that sort of thing. As for doctoring, if\nI want any I shall send for Fillgrave.\" Such were his last words as\nthe carriage, with a rush, went off from the door.\n\nThe doctor, as he re-entered the house, could not avoid smiling, for\nhe thought of Dr Fillgrave's last patient at Boxall Hill. \"It's a\nquestion to me,\" said he to himself, \"whether Dr Fillgrave will ever\nbe induced to make another visit to that house, even with the object\nof rescuing a baronet out of my hands.\"\n\n\"He's gone; isn't he, uncle?\" said Mary, coming out of her room.\n\n\"Yes, my dear; he's gone, poor fellow.\"\n\n\"He may be a poor fellow, uncle; but he's a very disagreeable inmate\nin a house. I have not had any dinner these two days.\"\n\n\"And I haven't had what can be called a cup of tea since he's been in\nthe house. But I'll make up for that to-night.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\n\nDe Courcy Precepts and de Courcy Practice\n\n\nThere is a mode of novel-writing which used to be much in vogue, but\nwhich has now gone out of fashion. It is, nevertheless, one which is\nvery expressive when in good hands, and which enables the author to\ntell his story, or some portion of his story, with more natural trust\nthan any other, I mean that of familiar letters. I trust I shall be\nexcused if I attempt it as regards this one chapter; though, it may\nbe, that I shall break down and fall into the commonplace narrative,\neven before the one chapter be completed. The correspondents are the\nLady Amelia de Courcy and Miss Gresham. I, of course, give precedence\nto the higher rank, but the first epistle originated with the\nlatter-named young lady. Let me hope that they will explain\nthemselves.\n\n\n   Miss Gresham to Lady Amelia de Courcy\n\n   Greshamsbury House, June, 185--.\n\n   MY DEAREST AMELIA,\n\n   I wish to consult you on a subject which, as you will\n   perceive, is of a most momentous nature. You know how much\n   reliance I place in your judgement and knowledge of what\n   is proper, and, therefore, I write to you before speaking\n   to any other living person on the subject: not even to\n   mamma; for, although her judgement is good too, she has so\n   many cares and troubles, that it is natural that it should\n   be a little warped when the interests of her children are\n   concerned. Now that it is all over, I feel that it may\n   possibly have been so in the case of Mr Moffat.\n\n   You are aware that Mr Mortimer Gazebee is now staying\n   here, and that he has been here for nearly two months. He\n   is engaged in managing poor papa's affairs, and mamma, who\n   likes him very much, says that he is a most excellent man\n   of business. Of course, you know that he is the junior\n   partner in the very old firm of Gumption, Gazebee, &\n   Gazebee, who, I understand, do not undertake any business\n   at all, except what comes to them from peers, or commoners\n   of the very highest class.\n\n   I soon perceived, dearest Amelia, that Mr Gazebee paid me\n   more than ordinary attention, and I immediately became\n   very guarded in my manner. I certainly liked Mr Gazebee\n   from the first. His manners are quite excellent, his\n   conduct to mamma is charming, and, as regards myself, I\n   must say that there has been nothing in his behaviour of\n   which even _you_ could complain. He has never attempted\n   the slightest familiarity, and I will do him the justice\n   to say, that, though he has been very attentive, he has\n   also been very respectful.\n\n   I must confess that, for the last three weeks, I have\n   thought that he meant something. I might, perhaps, have\n   done more to repel him; or I might have consulted you\n   earlier as to the propriety of keeping altogether out of\n   his way. But you know, Amelia, how often these things lead\n   to nothing, and though I thought all along that Mr Gazebee\n   was in earnest, I hardly liked to say anything about it\n   even to you till I was quite certain. If you had advised\n   me, you know, to accept his offer, and if, after that, he\n   had never made it, I should have felt so foolish.\n\n   But now he has made it. He came to me yesterday just\n   before dinner, in the little drawing-room, and told me, in\n   the most delicate manner, in words that even you could not\n   have but approved, that his highest ambition was to be\n   thought worthy of my regard, and that he felt for me the\n   warmest love, and the most profound admiration, and the\n   deepest respect. You may say, Amelia, that he is only an\n   attorney, and I believe that he is an attorney; but I am\n   sure you would have esteemed him had you heard the very\n   delicate way in which he expressed his sentiments.\n\n   Something had given me a presentiment of what he was going\n   to do when I saw him come into the room, so that I was\n   on my guard. I tried very hard to show no emotion; but I\n   suppose I was a little flurried, as I once detected myself\n   calling him Mr Mortimer: his name, you know, is Mortimer\n   Gazebee. I ought not to have done so, certainly; but it\n   was not so bad as if I had called him Mortimer without\n   the Mr, was it? I don't think there could possibly be a\n   prettier Christian name than Mortimer. Well, Amelia, I\n   allowed him to express himself without interruption. He\n   once attempted to take my hand; but even this was done\n   without any assumption of familiarity; and when he saw\n   that I would not permit it, he drew back, and fixed his\n   eyes on the ground as though he were ashamed even of that.\n\n   Of course, I had to give him an answer; and though I had\n   expected that something of this sort would take place,\n   I had not made up my mind on the subject. I would not,\n   certainly, under any circumstances, accept him without\n   consulting you. If I really disliked him, of course there\n   would be no doubt; but I can't say, dearest Amelia, that\n   I do absolutely dislike him; and I really think that we\n   would make each other very happy, if the marriage were\n   suitable as regarded both our positions.\n\n   I collected myself as well as I could, and I really do\n   think that you would have said that I did not behave\n   badly, though the position was rather trying. I told him\n   that, of course, I was flattered by his sentiments, though\n   much surprised at hearing them; that since I knew him, I\n   had esteemed and valued him as an acquaintance, but that,\n   looking on him as a man of business, I had never expected\n   anything more. I then endeavoured to explain to him, that\n   I was not perhaps privileged, as some other girls might\n   be, to indulge my own feelings altogether: perhaps that\n   was saying too much, and might make him think that I was\n   in love with him; but, from the way I said it, I don't\n   think he would, for I was very much guarded in my manner,\n   and very collected; and then I told him, that in any\n   proposal of marriage that might be made to me, it would\n   be my duty to consult my family as much, if not more than\n   myself.\n\n   He said, of course; and asked whether he might speak to\n   papa. I tried to make him understand, that in talking of\n   my family, I did not exactly mean papa, or even mamma.\n   Of course I was thinking of what was due to the name of\n   Gresham. I know very well what papa would say. He would\n   give his consent in half a minute; he is so broken-hearted\n   by these debts. And, to tell you the truth, Amelia, I\n   think mamma would too. He did not seem quite to comprehend\n   what I meant; but he did say that he knew it was a high\n   ambition to marry into the family of the Greshams. I\n   am sure you would confess that he has the most proper\n   feelings; and as for expressing them no man could do it\n   better.\n\n   He owned that it was ambition to ally himself with a\n   family above his own rank in life, and that he looked to\n   doing so as a means of advancing himself. Now this was at\n   any rate honest. That was one of his motives, he said;\n   though, of course, not his first: and then he declared\n   how truly attached he was to me. In answer to this, I\n   remarked, that he had known me only a very short time.\n   This, perhaps, was giving him too much encouragement; but,\n   at that moment, I hardly knew what to say, for I did not\n   wish to hurt his feelings. He then spoke of his income.\n   He has fifteen hundred a year from the business, and that\n   will be greatly increased when his father leaves it; and\n   his father is much older than Mr Gumption, though he is\n   only the second partner. Mortimer Gazebee will be the\n   senior partner himself before very long; and perhaps that\n   does alter his position a little.\n\n   He has a very nice place down somewhere in Surrey; I have\n   heard mamma say it is quite a gentleman's place. It is let\n   now; but he will live there when he is married. And he\n   has property of his own besides which he can settle. So,\n   you see, he is quite as well off as Mr Oriel; better,\n   indeed; and if a man is in a profession, I believe it is\n   considered that it does not much matter what. Of course, a\n   clergyman can be a bishop; but then, I think I have heard\n   that one attorney did once become Lord Chancellor. I\n   should have my carriage, you know; I remember his saying\n   that, especially, though I cannot recollect how he brought\n   it in.\n\n   I told him, at last, that I was so much taken by surprise\n   that I could not give him an answer then. He was going\n   up to London, he said, on the next day, and might he\n   be permitted to address me on the same subject when he\n   returned? I could not refuse him, you know; and so now I\n   have taken the opportunity of his absence to write to you\n   for your advice. You understand the world so very well,\n   and know so exactly what one ought to do in such a strange\n   position!\n\n   I hope I have made it intelligible, at least, as to what\n   I have written about. I have said nothing as to my own\n   feelings, because I wish you to think on the matter\n   without consulting them. If it would be derogatory to\n   accept Mr Gazebee, I certainly would not do so because I\n   happen to like him. If we were to act in that way, what\n   would the world come to, Amelia? Perhaps my ideas may be\n   overstrained; if so, you will tell me.\n\n   When Mr Oriel proposed for Beatrice, nobody seemed to make\n   any objection. It all seemed to go as a matter of course.\n   She says that his family is excellent; but as far as I can\n   learn, his grandfather was a general in India, and came\n   home very rich. Mr Gazebee's grandfather was a member of\n   the firm, and so, I believe, was his great-grandfather.\n   Don't you think this ought to count for something?\n   Besides, they have no business except with the most\n   aristocratic persons, such as uncle de Courcy, and the\n   Marquis of Kensington Gore, and that sort. I mention the\n   marquis, because Mr Mortimer Gazebee is there now. And I\n   know that one of the Gumptions was once in Parliament; and\n   I don't think that any of the Oriels ever were. The name\n   of attorney is certainly very bad, is it not, Amelia? but\n   they certainly do not seem to be all the same, and I do\n   think that this ought to make a difference. To hear Mr\n   Mortimer Gazebee talk of some attorney at Barchester, you\n   would say that there is quite as much difference between\n   them as between a bishop and a curate. And so I think\n   there is.\n\n   I don't wish at all to speak of my own feelings; but if he\n   were not an attorney, he is, I think, the sort of man I\n   should like. He is very nice in every way, and if you were\n   not told, I don't think you'd know he was an attorney.\n   But, dear Amelia, I will be guided by you altogether. He\n   is certainly much nicer than Mr Moffat, and has a great\n   deal more to say for himself. Of course, Mr Moffat having\n   been in Parliament, and having been taken up by uncle\n   de Courcy, was in a different sphere; but I really felt\n   almost relieved when he behaved in that way. With Mortimer\n   Gazebee, I think it would be different.\n\n   I shall wait so impatiently for your answer, so do pray\n   write at once. I hear some people say that these sort of\n   things are not so much thought of now as they were once,\n   and that all manner of marriages are considered to be\n   _comme il faut_. I do not want, you know, to make myself\n   foolish by being too particular. Perhaps all these changes\n   are bad, and I rather think they are; but if the world\n   changes, one must change too; one can't go against the\n   world.\n\n   So do write and tell me what you think. Do not suppose\n   that I dislike the man, for I really cannot say that I do.\n   But I would not for anything make an alliance for which\n   any one bearing the name of de Courcy would have to blush.\n\n   Always, dearest Amelia,\n\n   Your most affectionate cousin,\n\n   AUGUSTA GRESHAM.\n\n   P.S.--I fear Frank is going to be very foolish with Mary\n   Thorne. You know it is absolutely important that Frank\n   should marry money.\n\n   It strikes me as quite possible that Mortimer Gazebee may\n   be in Parliament some of these days. He is just the man\n   for it.\n\n\nPoor Augusta prayed very hard for her husband; but she prayed to a\nbosom that on this subject was as hard as a flint, and she prayed\nin vain. Augusta Gresham was twenty-two, Lady Amelia de Courcy was\nthirty-four; was it likely that Lady Amelia would permit Augusta\nto marry, the issue having thus been left in her hands? Why should\nAugusta derogate from her position by marrying beneath herself,\nseeing that Lady Amelia had spent so many more years in the world\nwithout having found it necessary to do so? Augusta's letter was\nwritten on two sheets of note-paper, crossed all over; and Lady\nAmelia's answer was almost equally formidable.\n\n\n   Lady Amelia de Courcy to Miss Augusta Gresham\n\n   Courcy Castle, June, 185--.\n\n   MY DEAR AUGUSTA,\n\n   I received your letter yesterday morning, but I have put\n   off answering it till this evening, as I have wished to\n   give it very mature consideration. The question is one\n   which concerns, not only your character, but happiness\n   for life, and nothing less than very mature consideration\n   would justify me in giving a decided opinion on the\n   subject.\n\n   In the first place, I may tell you, that I have not a word\n   to say against Mr Mortimer Gazebee. [When Augusta had read\n   as far as this, her heart sank within her; the rest was\n   all leather and prunella; she saw at once that the fiat\n   had gone against her, and that her wish to become Mrs\n   Mortimer Gazebee was not to be indulged.] I have known\n   him for a long time, and I believe him to be a very\n   respectable person, and I have no doubt a good man of\n   business. The firm of Messrs Gumption & Gazebee stands\n   probably quite among the first attorneys in London, and I\n   know that papa has a very high opinion of them.\n\n   All of these would be excellent arguments to use in favour\n   of Mr Gazebee as a suitor, had his proposals been made to\n   any one in his own rank of life. But you, in considering\n   the matter, should, I think, look on it in a very\n   different light. The very fact that you pronounce him to\n   be so much superior to other attorneys, shows in how very\n   low esteem you hold the profession in general. It shows\n   also, dear Augusta, how well aware you are that they are a\n   class of people among whom you should not seek a partner\n   for life.\n\n   My opinion is, that you should make Mr Gazebee\n   understand--very courteously, of course--that you cannot\n   accept his hand. You observe that he himself confesses,\n   that in marrying you he would seek a wife in a rank above\n   his own. Is it not, therefore, clear, that in marrying\n   him, you would descend to a rank below your own?\n\n   I shall be very sorry if this grieves you; but still\n   it will be better that you should bear the grief of\n   overcoming a temporary fancy, than take a step which may\n   so probably make you unhappy; and which some of your\n   friends would certainly regard as disgraceful.\n\n   It is not permitted to us, my dear Augusta, to think of\n   ourselves in such matters. As you truly say, if we were\n   to act in that way, what would the world come to? It has\n   been God's pleasure that we should be born with high blood\n   in our veins. This is a great boon which we both value,\n   but the boon has its responsibilities as well as its\n   privileges. It is established by law, that the royal\n   family shall not intermarry with subjects. In our case\n   there is no law, but the necessity is not the less felt;\n   we should not intermarry with those who are probably\n   of a lower rank. Mr Mortimer Gazebee is, after all,\n   only an attorney; and, although you speak of his\n   great-grandfather, he is a man of no blood whatsoever. You\n   must acknowledge that such an admixture should be looked\n   on by a de Courcy, or even by a Gresham, as a pollution.\n   [Here Augusta got very red, and she felt almost inclined\n   to be angry with her cousin.] Beatrice's marriage with Mr\n   Oriel is different; though, remember, I am by no means\n   defending that; it may be good or bad, and I have had no\n   opportunity of inquiring respecting Mr Oriel's family.\n   Beatrice, moreover, has never appeared to me to feel\n   what was due to herself in such matters; but, as I\n   said, her marriage with Mr Oriel is very different.\n   Clergymen--particularly the rectors and vicars of country\n   parishes--do become privileged above other professional\n   men. I could explain why, but it would be too long in a\n   letter.\n\n   Your feelings on the subject altogether do you great\n   credit. I have no doubt that Mr Gresham, if asked, would\n   accede to the match; but that is just the reason why he\n   should not be asked. It would not be right that I should\n   say anything against your father to you; but it is\n   impossible for any of us not to see that all through life\n   he has thrown away every advantage, and sacrificed his\n   family. Why is he now in debt, as you say? Why is he not\n   holding the family seat in Parliament? Even though you are\n   his daughter, you cannot but feel that you would not do\n   right to consult him on such a subject.\n\n   As to dear aunt, I feel sure, that were she in good\n   health, and left to exercise her own judgement, she would\n   not wish to see you married to the agent for the family\n   estate. For, dear Augusta, that is the real truth. Mr\n   Gazebee often comes here in the way of business; and\n   though papa always receives him as a gentleman--that is,\n   he dines at table and all that--he is not on the same\n   footing in the house as the ordinary guests and friends of\n   the family. How would you like to be received at Courcy\n   Castle in the same way?\n\n   You will say, perhaps, that you would still be papa's\n   niece; so you would. But you know how strict in such\n   matters papa is, and you must remember, that the wife\n   always follows the rank of the husband. Papa is accustomed\n   to the strict etiquette of a court, and I am sure that no\n   consideration would induce him to receive the estate-agent\n   in the light of a nephew. Indeed, were you to marry Mr\n   Gazebee, the house to which he belongs would, I imagine,\n   have to give up the management of this property.\n\n   Even were Mr Gazebee in Parliament--and I do not see how\n   it is probable that he should get there--it would not make\n   any difference. You must remember, dearest, that I never\n   was an advocate for the Moffat match. I acquiesced in it,\n   because mamma did so. If I could have had my own way,\n   I would adhere to all our old prescriptive principles.\n   Neither money nor position can atone to me for low birth.\n   But the world, alas! is retrograding; and, according to\n   the new-fangled doctrines of the day, a lady of blood is\n   not disgraced by allying herself to a man of wealth, and\n   what may be called quasi-aristocratic position. I wish it\n   were otherwise; but so it is. And, therefore, the match\n   with Mr Moffat was not disgraceful, though it could not be\n   regarded as altogether satisfactory.\n\n   But with Mr Gazebee the matter would be altogether\n   different. He is a man earning his bread; honestly, I\n   dare say, but in a humble position. You say he is very\n   respectable: I do not doubt it; and so is Mr Scraggs,\n   the butcher at Courcy. You see, Augusta, to what such\n   arguments reduce you.\n\n   I dare say he may be nicer than Mr Moffat, in one way.\n   That is, he may have more small-talk at his command, and\n   be more clever in all those little pursuits and amusements\n   which are valued by ordinary young ladies. But my\n   opinion is, that neither I nor you would be justified in\n   sacrificing ourselves for such amusements. We have high\n   duties before us. It may be that the performance of those\n   duties will prohibit us from taking a part in the ordinary\n   arena of the feminine world. It is natural that girls\n   should wish to marry; and, therefore, those who are weak,\n   take the first that come. Those who have more judgement,\n   make some sort of selection. But the strongest-minded are,\n   perhaps, those who are able to forgo themselves and their\n   own fancies, and to refrain from any alliance that does\n   not tend to the maintenance of high principles. Of course,\n   I speak of those who have blood in their veins. You and I\n   need not dilate as to the conduct of others.\n\n   I hope what I have said will convince you. Indeed, I know\n   that it only requires that you and I should have a little\n   cousinly talk on this matter to be quite in accord. You\n   must now remain at Greshamsbury till Mr Gazebee shall\n   return. Immediately that he does so, seek an interview\n   with him; do not wait till he asks for it; then tell him,\n   that when he addressed you, the matter had taken you so\n   much by surprise, that you were not at the moment able to\n   answer him with that decision that the subject demanded.\n   Tell him, that you are flattered--in saying this, however,\n   you must keep a collected countenance, and be very cold\n   in your manner--but that family reasons would forbid you\n   to avail yourself of his offer, even did no other cause\n   prevent it.\n\n   And then, dear Augusta, come to us here. I know you\n   will be a little down-hearted after going through this\n   struggle; but I will endeavour to inspirit you. When we\n   are both together, you will feel more sensibly the value\n   of that high position which you will preserve by rejecting\n   Mr Gazebee, and will regret less acutely whatever you may\n   lose.\n\n   Your very affectionate cousin,\n\n   AMELIA DE COURCY.\n\n   P.S.--I am greatly grieved about Frank; but I have long\n   feared that he would do some very silly thing. I have\n   heard lately that Miss Mary Thorne is not even the\n   legitimate niece of your Dr Thorne, but is the daughter\n   of some poor creature who was seduced by the doctor, in\n   Barchester. I do not know how true this may be, but I\n   think your brother should be put on his guard: it might do\n   good.\n\n\nPoor Augusta! She was in truth to be pitied, for her efforts were\nmade with the intention of doing right according to her lights. For\nMr Moffat she had never cared a straw; and when, therefore, she lost\nthe piece of gilding for which she had been instructed by her mother\nto sell herself, it was impossible to pity her. But Mr Gazebee she\nwould have loved with that sort of love which it was in her power\nto bestow. With him she would have been happy, respectable, and\ncontented.\n\nShe had written her letter with great care. When the offer was made\nto her, she could not bring herself to throw Lady Amelia to the winds\nand marry the man, as it were, out of her own head. Lady Amelia had\nbeen the tyrant of her life, and so she strove hard to obtain her\ntyrant's permission. She used all her little cunning in showing\nthat, after all, Mr Gazebee was not so very plebeian. All her little\ncunning was utterly worthless. Lady Amelia's mind was too strong to\nbe caught with such chaff. Augusta could not serve God and Mammon.\nShe must either be true to the god of her cousin's idolatry, and\nremain single, or serve the Mammon of her own inclinations, and marry\nMr Gazebee.\n\nWhen refolding her cousin's letter, after the first perusal, she did\nfor a moment think of rebellion. Could she not be happy at the nice\nplace in Surrey, having, as she would have, a carriage, even though\nall the de Courcys should drop her? It had been put to her that\nshe would not like to be received at Courcy Castle with the scant\ncivility which would be considered due to a Mrs Mortimer Gazebee; but\nwhat if she could put up without being received at Courcy Castle at\nall? Such ideas did float through her mind, dimly.\n\nBut her courage failed her. It is so hard to throw off a tyrant; so\nmuch easier to yield, when we have been in the habit of yielding.\nThis third letter, therefore, was written; and it is the end of the\ncorrespondence.\n\n\n   Miss Augusta Gresham to Lady Amelia de Courcy\n\n   Greshamsbury House, July, 185--.\n\n   MY DEAREST AMELIA,\n\n   I did not answer your letter before, because I thought it\n   better to delay doing so till Mr Gazebee had been here.\n   He came the day before yesterday, and yesterday I did,\n   as nearly as possible, what you advised. Perhaps, on\n   the whole, it will be better. As you say, rank has its\n   responsibilities as well as its privileges.\n\n   I don't quite understand what you mean about clergymen,\n   but we can talk that over when we meet. Indeed, it seems\n   to me that if one is to be particular about family--and\n   I am sure I think we ought--one ought to be so without\n   exception. If Mr Oriel be a _parvenu_, Beatrice's\n   children won't be well born merely because their father\n   was a clergyman, even though he is a rector. Since\n   my former letter, I have heard that Mr Gazebee's\n   great-great-great-grandfather established the firm; and\n   there are many people who were nobodies then who are\n   thought to have good blood in their veins now.\n\n   But I do not say this because I differ from you. I agree\n   with you so fully, that I at once made up my mind to\n   reject the man; and, consequently, I have done so.\n\n   When I told him I could not accept him from family\n   considerations, he asked me whether I had spoken to papa.\n   I told him, no; and that it would be no good, as I had\n   made up my own mind. I don't think he quite understood me;\n   but it did not perhaps much matter. You told me to be very\n   cold, and I think that perhaps he thought me less gracious\n   than before. Indeed, I fear that when he first spoke,\n   I may seem to have given him too much encouragement.\n   However, it is all over now; quite over! [As Augusta wrote\n   this, she barely managed to save the paper beneath her\n   hand from being moistened with the tear which escaped from\n   her eye.]\n\n   I do not mind confessing now, [she continued] at any rate\n   to you, that I did like Mr Gazebee a little. I think his\n   temper and disposition would have suited me. But I am\n   quite satisfied that I have done right. He tried very hard\n   to make me change my mind. That is, he said a great many\n   things as to whether I would not put off my decision. But\n   I was quite firm. I must say that he behaved very well,\n   and that I really do think he liked me honestly and truly;\n   but, of course, I could not sacrifice family\n   considerations on that account.\n\n   Yes, rank has its responsibilities as well as its\n   privileges. I will remember that. It is necessary to do\n   so, as otherwise one would be without consolation for what\n   one has to suffer. For I find that one has to suffer,\n   Amelia. I know papa would have advised me to marry this\n   man; and so, I dare say, mamma would, and Frank, and\n   Beatrice, if they knew that I liked him. It would not be\n   so bad if we all thought alike about it; but it is hard to\n   have the responsibilities all on one's own shoulder; is it\n   not?\n\n   But I will go over to you, and you will comfort me. I\n   always feel stronger on this subject at Courcy than at\n   Greshamsbury. We will have a long talk about it, and then\n   I shall be happy again. I purpose going on next Friday, if\n   that will suit you and dear aunt. I have told mamma that\n   you all wanted me, and she made no objection. Do write at\n   once, dearest Amelia, for to hear from you now will be my\n   only comfort.\n\n   Yours, ever most affectionately and obliged,\n\n   AUGUSTA GRESHAM.\n\n   P.S.--I told mamma what you said about Mary Thorne, and\n   she said, \"Yes; I suppose all the world knows it now; and\n   if all the world did know it, it makes no difference to\n   Frank.\" She seemed very angry; so you see it was true.\n\n\nThough, by so doing, we shall somewhat anticipate the end of our\nstory, it may be desirable that the full tale of Mr Gazebee's loves\nshould be told here. When Mary is breaking her heart on her death-bed\nin the last chapter, or otherwise accomplishing her destiny, we shall\nhardly find a fit opportunity of saying much about Mr Gazebee and his\naristocratic bride.\n\nFor he did succeed at last in obtaining a bride in whose veins ran\nthe noble ichor of de Courcy blood, in spite of the high doctrine\npreached so eloquently by the Lady Amelia. As Augusta had truly said,\nhe had failed to understand her. He was led to think, by her manner\nof receiving his first proposal--and justly so, enough--that she\nliked him, and would accept him; and he was, therefore, rather\nperplexed by his second interview. He tried again and again, and\nbegged permission to mention the matter to Mr Gresham; but Augusta\nwas very firm, and he at last retired in disgust. Augusta went to\nCourcy Castle, and received from her cousin that consolation and\nre-strengthening which she so much required.\n\nFour years afterwards--long after the fate of Mary Thorne had fallen,\nlike a thunderbolt, on the inhabitants of Greshamsbury; when Beatrice\nwas preparing for her second baby, and each of the twins had her\naccepted lover--Mr Mortimer Gazebee went down to Courcy Castle; of\ncourse, on matters of business. No doubt he dined at the table, and\nall that. We have the word of Lady Amelia, that the earl, with his\nusual good-nature, allowed him such privileges. Let us hope that he\nnever encroached on them.\n\nBut on this occasion, Mr Gazebee stayed a long time at the castle,\nand singular rumours as to the cause of his prolonged visit became\ncurrent in the little town. No female scion of the present family of\nCourcy had, as yet, found a mate. We may imagine that eagles find it\ndifficult to pair when they become scarce in their localities; and\nwe all know how hard it has sometimes been to get _comme il faut_\nhusbands when there has been any number of Protestant princesses on\nhand.\n\nSome such difficulty had, doubtless, brought it about that the\ncountess was still surrounded by her full bevy of maidens. Rank has\nits responsibilities as well as its privileges, and these young\nladies' responsibilities seemed to have consisted in rejecting any\nsuitor who may have hitherto kneeled to them. But now it was told\nthrough Courcy, that one suitor had kneeled, and not in vain; from\nCourcy the rumour flew to Barchester, and thence came down to\nGreshamsbury, startling the inhabitants, and making one poor heart\nthrob with a violence that would have been piteous had it been known.\nThe suitor, so named, was Mr Mortimer Gazebee.\n\nYes; Mr Mortimer Gazebee had now awarded to him many other privileges\nthan those of dining at the table, and all that. He rode with the\nyoung ladies in the park, and they all talked to him very familiarly\nbefore company; all except the Lady Amelia. The countess even called\nhim Mortimer, and treated him quite as one of the family.\n\nAt last came a letter from the countess to her dear sister Arabella.\nIt should be given at length, but that I fear to introduce another\nepistle. It is such an easy mode of writing, and facility is always\ndangerous. In this letter it was announced with much preliminary\nambiguity, that Mortimer Gazebee--who had been found to be a treasure\nin every way; quite a paragon of men--was about to be taken into the\nde Courcy bosom as a child of that house. On that day fortnight, he\nwas destined to lead to the altar--the Lady Amelia.\n\nThe countess then went on to say, that dear Amelia did not\nwrite herself, being so much engaged by her coming duties--the\nresponsibilities of which she doubtless fully realised, as well as\nthe privileges; but she had begged her mother to request that the\ntwins should come and act as bridesmaids on the occasion. Dear\nAugusta, she knew, was too much occupied in the coming event in Mr\nOriel's family to be able to attend.\n\nMr Mortimer Gazebee was taken into the de Courcy family, and did lead\nthe Lady Amelia to the altar; and the Gresham twins did go there and\nact as bridesmaids. And, which is much more to say for human nature,\nAugusta did forgive her cousin, and, after a certain interval, went\non a visit to that nice place in Surrey which she had once hoped\nwould be her own home. It would have been a very nice place, Augusta\nthought, had not Lady Amelia Gazebee been so very economical.\n\nWe must presume that there was some explanation between them. If so,\nAugusta yielded to it, and confessed it to be satisfactory. She had\nalways yielded to her cousin, and loved her with that sort of love\nwhich is begotten between fear and respect. Anything was better than\nquarrelling with her cousin Amelia.\n\nAnd Mr Mortimer Gazebee did not altogether make a bad bargain. He\nnever received a shilling of dowry, but that he had not expected.\nNor did he want it. His troubles arose from the overstrained economy\nof his noble wife. She would have it, that as she had married a\npoor man--Mr Gazebee, however, was not a poor man--it behoved\nher to manage her house with great care. Such a match as that\nshe had made--this she told in confidence to Augusta--had its\nresponsibilities as well as its privileges.\n\nBut, on the whole, Mr Gazebee did not repent his bargain; when he\nasked his friends to dine, he could tell them that Lady Amelia would\nbe very glad to see them; his marriage gave him some \u00c3\u00a9clat at his\nclub, and some additional weight in the firm to which he belonged;\nhe gets his share of the Courcy shooting, and is asked about to\nGreshamsbury and other Barsetshire houses, not only \"to dine at table\nand all that,\" but to take his part in whatever delights country\nsociety there has to offer. He lives with the great hope that\nhis noble father-in-law may some day be able to bring him into\nParliament.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX\n\nWhat the World Says about Blood\n\n\n\"Beatrice,\" said Frank, rushing suddenly into his sister's room, \"I\nwant you to do me one especial favour.\" This was three or four days\nafter Frank had seen Mary Thorne. Since that time he had spoken to\nnone of his family on the subject; but he was only postponing from\nday to day the task of telling his father. He had now completed his\nround of visits to the kennel, master huntsman, and stables of the\ncounty hunt, and was at liberty to attend to his own affairs. So he\nhad decided on speaking to the squire that very day; but he first\nmade his request to his sister.\n\n\"I want you to do me one especial favour.\" The day for Beatrice's\nmarriage had now been fixed, and it was not to be very distant.\nMr Oriel had urged that their honeymoon trip would lose half its\ndelights if they did not take advantage of the fine weather; and\nBeatrice had nothing to allege in answer. The day had just been\nfixed, and when Frank ran into her room with his special request,\nshe was not in a humour to refuse him anything.\n\n\"If you wish me to be at your wedding, you must do it,\" said he.\n\n\"Wish you to be there! You must be there, of course. Oh, Frank! what\ndo you mean? I'll do anything you ask; if it is not to go to the\nmoon, or anything of that sort.\"\n\nFrank was too much in earnest to joke. \"You must have Mary for one of\nyour bridesmaids,\" he said. \"Now, mind; there may be some difficulty,\nbut you must insist on it. I know what has been going on; but it is\nnot to be borne that she should be excluded on such a day as that.\nYou that have been like sisters all your lives till a year ago!\"\n\n\"But, Frank--\"\n\n\"Now, Beatrice, don't have any buts; say that you will do it, and it\nwill be done: I am sure Oriel will approve, and so will my father.\"\n\n\"But, Frank, you won't hear me.\"\n\n\"Not if you make objections; I have set my heart on your doing it.\"\n\n\"But I had set my heart on the same thing.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"And I went to Mary on purpose; and told her just as you tell me now,\nthat she must come. I meant to make mamma understand that I could not\nbe happy unless it were so; but Mary positively refused.\"\n\n\"Refused! What did she say?\"\n\n\"I could not tell you what she said; indeed, it would not be right if\nI could; but she positively declined. She seemed to feel, that after\nall that had happened, she never could come to Greshamsbury again.\"\n\n\"Fiddlestick!\"\n\n\"But, Frank, those are her feelings; and, to tell the truth, I could\nnot combat them. I know she is not happy; but time will cure that.\nAnd, to tell you the truth, Frank--\"\n\n\"It was before I came back that you asked her, was it not?\"\n\n\"Yes; just the day before you came, I think.\"\n\n\"Well, it's all altered now. I have seen her since that.\"\n\n\"Have you Frank?\"\n\n\"What do you take me for? Of course, I have. The very first day I\nwent to her. And now, Beatrice, you may believe me or not, as you\nlike; but if I ever marry, I shall marry Mary Thorne; and if ever she\nmarries, I think I may say, she will marry me. At any rate, I have\nher promise. And now, you cannot be surprised that I should wish\nher to be at your wedding; or that I should declare, that if she is\nabsent, I will be absent. I don't want any secrets, and you may tell\nmy mother if you like it--and all the de Courcys too, for anything I\ncare.\"\n\nFrank had ever been used to command his sisters: and they, especially\nBeatrice, had ever been used to obey. On this occasion, she was well\ninclined to do so, if she only knew how. She again remembered how\nMary had once sworn to be at her wedding, to be near her, and to\ntouch her--even though all the blood of the de Courcys should be\ncrowded before the altar railings.\n\n\"I should be so happy that she should be there; but what am I to do,\nFrank, if she refuses? I have asked her, and she has refused.\"\n\n\"Go to her again; you need not have any scruples with her. Do\nnot I tell you she will be your sister? Not come here again to\nGreshamsbury! Why, I tell you that she will be living here while you\nare living there at the parsonage, for years and years to come.\"\n\nBeatrice promised that she would go to Mary again, and that she would\nendeavour to talk her mother over if Mary would consent to come. But\nshe could not yet make herself believe that Mary Thorne would ever\nbe mistress of Greshamsbury. It was so indispensably necessary that\nFrank should marry money! Besides, what were those horrid rumours\nwhich were now becoming rife as to Mary's birth; rumours more horrid\nthan any which had yet been heard?\n\nAugusta had said hardly more than the truth when she spoke of her\nfather being broken-hearted by his debts. His troubles were becoming\nalmost too many for him; and Mr Gazebee, though no doubt he was an\nexcellent man of business, did not seem to lessen them. Mr Gazebee,\nindeed, was continually pointing out how much he owed, and in what\na quagmire of difficulties he had entangled himself. Now, to do Mr\nYates Umbleby justice, he had never made himself disagreeable in this\nmanner.\n\nMr Gazebee had been doubtless right, when he declared that Sir Louis\nScatcherd had not himself the power to take any steps hostile to the\nsquire; but Sir Louis had also been right, when he boasted that,\nin spite of his father's will, he could cause others to move in\nthe matter. Others did move, and were moving, and it began to be\nunderstood that a moiety, at least, of the remaining Greshamsbury\nproperty must be sold. Even this, however, would by no means leave\nthe squire in undisturbed possession of the other moiety. And thus,\nMr Gresham was nearly broken-hearted.\n\nFrank had now been at home a week, and his father had not as yet\nspoken to him about the family troubles; nor had a word as yet been\nsaid between them as to Mary Thorne. It had been agreed that Frank\nshould go away for twelve months, in order that he might forget her.\nHe had been away the twelvemonth, and had now returned, not having\nforgotten her.\n\nIt generally happens, that in every household, one subject of\nimportance occupies it at a time. The subject of importance now\nmostly thought of in the Greshamsbury household, was the marriage of\nBeatrice. Lady Arabella had to supply the trousseau for her daughter;\nthe squire had to supply the money for the trousseau; Mr Gazebee had\nthe task of obtaining the money for the squire. While this was going\non, Mr Gresham was not anxious to talk to his son, either about his\nown debts or his son's love. There would be time for these things\nwhen the marriage-feast should be over.\n\nSo thought the father, but the matter was precipitated by Frank. He\nalso had put off the declaration which he had to make, partly from\na wish to spare the squire, but partly also with a view to spare\nhimself. We have all some of that cowardice which induces us to\npostpone an inevitably evil day. At this time the discussions as\nto Beatrice's wedding were frequent in the house, and at one of\nthem Frank had heard his mother repeat the names of the proposed\nbridesmaids. Mary's name was not among them, and hence had arisen his\nattack on his sister.\n\nLady Arabella had had her reason for naming the list before her son;\nbut she overshot her mark. She wished to show him how totally Mary\nwas forgotten at Greshamsbury; but she only inspired him with a\nresolve that she should not be forgotten. He accordingly went to his\nsister; and then, the subject being full on his mind, he resolved at\nonce to discuss it with his father.\n\n\"Sir, are you at leisure for five minutes?\" he said, entering the\nroom in which the squire was accustomed to sit majestically, to\nreceive his tenants, scold his dependants, and in which, in former\nhappy days, he had always arranged the meets of the Barsetshire hunt.\n\nMr Gresham was quite at leisure: when was he not so? But had he been\nimmersed in the deepest business of which he was capable, he would\ngladly have put it aside at his son's instance.\n\n\"I don't like to have any secret from you, sir,\" said Frank; \"nor,\nfor the matter of that, from anybody else\"--the anybody else was\nintended to have reference to his mother--\"and, therefore, I would\nrather tell you at once what I have made up my mind to do.\"\n\nFrank's address was very abrupt, and he felt it was so. He was rather\nred in the face, and his manner was fluttered. He had quite made up\nhis mind to break the whole affair to his father; but he had hardly\nmade up his mind as to the best mode of doing so.\n\n\"Good heavens, Frank! what do you mean? you are not going to do\nanything rash? What is it you mean, Frank?\"\n\n\"I don't think it is rash,\" said Frank.\n\n\"Sit down, my boy; sit down. What is it that you say you are going to\ndo?\"\n\n\"Nothing immediately, sir,\" said he, rather abashed; \"but as I have\nmade up my mind about Mary Thorne,--quite made up my mind, I think it\nright to tell you.\"\n\n\"Oh, about Mary,\" said the squire, almost relieved.\n\nAnd then Frank, in voluble language, which he hardly, however, had\nquite under his command, told his father all that had passed between\nhim and Mary. \"You see, sir,\" said he, \"that it is fixed now, and\ncannot be altered. Nor must it be altered. You asked me to go away\nfor twelve months, and I have done so. It has made no difference, you\nsee. As to our means of living, I am quite willing to do anything\nthat may be best and most prudent. I was thinking, sir, of taking a\nfarm somewhere near here, and living on that.\"\n\nThe squire sat quite silent for some moments after this communication\nhad been made to him. Frank's conduct, as a son, had been such that\nhe could not find fault with it; and, in this special matter of his\nlove, how was it possible for him to find fault? He himself was\nalmost as fond of Mary as of a daughter; and, though he too would\nhave been desirous that his son should relieve the estate from its\nembarrassments by a rich marriage, he did not at all share Lady\nArabella's feelings on the subject. No Countess de Courcy had ever\nengraved it on the tablets of his mind that the world would come to\nruin if Frank did not marry money. Ruin there was, and would be, but\nit had been brought about by no sin of Frank's.\n\n\"Do you remember about her birth, Frank?\" he said, at last.\n\n\"Yes, sir; everything. She told me all she knew; and Dr Thorne\nfinished the story.\"\n\n\"And what do you think of it?\"\n\n\"It is a pity, and a misfortune. It might, perhaps, have been a\nreason why you or my mother should not have had Mary in the house\nmany years ago; but it cannot make any difference now.\"\n\nFrank had not meant to lean so heavily on his father; but he did do\nso. The story had never been told to Lady Arabella; was not even\nknown to her now, positively, and on good authority. But Mr Gresham\nhad always known it. If Mary's birth was so great a stain upon her,\nwhy had he brought her into his house among his children?\n\n\"It is a misfortune, Frank; a very great misfortune. It will not\ndo for you and me to ignore birth; too much of the value of one's\nposition depends upon it.\"\n\n\"But what was Mr Moffat's birth?\" said Frank, almost with scorn; \"or\nwhat Miss Dunstable's?\" he would have added, had it not been that his\nfather had not been concerned in that sin of wedding him to the oil\nof Lebanon.\n\n\"True, Frank. But yet, what you would mean to say is not true. We\nmust take the world as we find it. Were you to marry a rich heiress,\nwere her birth even as low as that of poor Mary--\"\n\n\"Don't call her poor Mary, father; she is not poor. My wife will have\na right to take rank in the world, however she was born.\"\n\n\"Well,--poor in that way. But were she an heiress, the world would\nforgive her birth on account of her wealth.\"\n\n\"The world is very complaisant, sir.\"\n\n\"You must take it as you find it, Frank. I only say that such is the\nfact. If Porlock were to marry the daughter of a shoeblack, without a\nfarthing, he would make a _m\u00c3\u00a9salliance_; but if the daughter of the\nshoeblack had half a million of money, nobody would dream of saying\nso. I am stating no opinion of my own: I am only giving you the\nworld's opinion.\"\n\n\"I don't give a straw for the world.\"\n\n\"That is a mistake, my boy; you do care for it, and would be very\nfoolish if you did not. What you mean is, that, on this particular\npoint, you value your love more than the world's opinion.\"\n\n\"Well, yes, that is what I mean.\"\n\nBut the squire, though he had been very lucid in his definition, had\ngot no nearer to his object; had not even yet ascertained what his\nown object was. This marriage would be ruinous to Greshamsbury; and\nyet, what was he to say against it, seeing that the ruin had been\nhis fault, and not his son's?\n\n\"You could let me have a farm; could you not, sir? I was thinking\nof about six or seven hundred acres. I suppose it could be managed\nsomehow?\"\n\n\"A farm?\" said the father, abstractedly.\n\n\"Yes, sir. I must do something for my living. I should make less of\na mess of that than of anything else. Besides, it would take such a\ntime to be an attorney, or a doctor, or anything of that sort.\"\n\nDo something for his living! And was the heir of Greshamsbury come to\nthis--the heir and only son? Whereas, he, the squire, had succeeded\nat an earlier age than Frank's to an unembarrassed income of fourteen\nthousand pounds a year! The reflection was very hard to bear.\n\n\"Yes: I dare say you could have a farm:\" and then he threw himself\nback in his chair, closing his eyes. Then, after a while, rose again,\nand walked hurriedly about the room. \"Frank,\" he said, at last,\nstanding opposite to his son, \"I wonder what you think of me?\"\n\n\"Think of you, sir?\" ejaculated Frank.\n\n\"Yes; what do you think of me, for having thus ruined you. I wonder\nwhether you hate me?\"\n\nFrank, jumping up from his chair, threw his arms round his father's\nneck. \"Hate you, sir? How can you speak so cruelly? You know well\nthat I love you. And, father, do not trouble yourself about the\nestate for my sake. I do not care for it; I can be just as happy\nwithout it. Let the girls have what is left, and I will make my own\nway in the world, somehow. I will go to Australia; yes, sir, that\nwill be best. I and Mary will both go. Nobody will care about her\nbirth there. But, father, never say, never think, that I do not love\nyou!\"\n\nThe squire was too much moved to speak at once, so he sat down again,\nand covered his face with his hands. Frank went on pacing the room,\ntill, gradually, his first idea recovered possession of his mind, and\nthe remembrance of his father's grief faded away. \"May I tell Mary,\"\nhe said at last, \"that you consent to our marriage? It will make her\nso happy.\"\n\nBut the squire was not prepared to say this. He was pledged to his\nwife to do all that he could to oppose it; and he himself thought,\nthat if anything could consummate the family ruin, it would be this\nmarriage.\n\n\"I cannot say that, Frank; I cannot say that. What would you both\nlive on? It would be madness.\"\n\n\"We would go to Australia,\" answered he, bitterly. \"I have just said\nso.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, my boy; you cannot do that. You must not throw the old place\nup altogether. There is no other one but you, Frank; and we have\nlived here now for so many, many years.\"\n\n\"But if we cannot live here any longer, father?\"\n\n\"But for this scheme of yours, we might do so. I will give up\neverything to you, the management of the estate, the park, all the\nland we have in hand, if you will give up this fatal scheme. For,\nFrank, it is fatal. You are only twenty-three; why should you be in\nsuch a hurry to marry?\"\n\n\"You married at twenty-one, sir.\"\n\nFrank was again severe on his father, but unwittingly. \"Yes, I did,\"\nsaid Mr Gresham; \"and see what has come of it! Had I waited ten years\nlonger, how different would everything have been! No, Frank, I cannot\nconsent to such a marriage; nor will your mother.\"\n\n\"It is your consent I ask, sir; and I am asking for nothing but your\nconsent.\"\n\n\"It would be sheer madness; madness for you both. My own Frank, my\ndear, dear boy, do not drive me to distraction! Give it up for four\nyears.\"\n\n\"Four years!\"\n\n\"Yes; for four years. I ask it as a personal favour; as an obligation\nto myself, in order that we may be saved from ruin; you, your mother,\nand sisters, your family name, and the old house. I do not talk about\nmyself; but were such a marriage to take place, I should be driven to\ndespair.\"\n\nFrank found it very hard to resist his father, who now had hold of\nhis hand and arm, and was thus half retaining him, and half embracing\nhim. \"Frank, say that you will forget this for four years--say for\nthree years.\"\n\nBut Frank would not say so. To postpone his marriage for four years,\nor for three, seemed to him to be tantamount to giving up Mary\naltogether; and he would not acknowledge that any one had the right\nto demand of him to do that.\n\n\"My word is pledged, sir,\" he said.\n\n\"Pledged! Pledged to whom?\"\n\n\"To Miss Thorne.\"\n\n\"But I will see her, Frank;--and her uncle. She was always\nreasonable. I am sure she will not wish to bring ruin on her old\nfriends at Greshamsbury.\"\n\n\"Her old friends at Greshamsbury have done but little lately to\ndeserve her consideration. She has been treated shamefully. I know\nit has not been by you, sir; but I must say so. She has already been\ntreated shamefully; but I will not treat her falsely.\"\n\n\"Well, Frank, I can say no more to you. I have destroyed the estate\nwhich should have been yours, and I have no right to expect you\nshould regard what I say.\"\n\nFrank was greatly distressed. He had not any feeling of animosity\nagainst his father with reference to the property, and would have\ndone anything to make the squire understand this, short of giving up\nhis engagement to Mary. His feeling rather was, that, as each had a\ncase against the other, they should cry quits; that he should forgive\nhis father for his bad management, on condition that he himself was\nto be forgiven with regard to his determined marriage. Not that he\nput it exactly in that shape, even to himself; but could he have\nunravelled his own thoughts, he would have found that such was the\nweb on which they were based.\n\n\"Father, I do regard what you say; but you would not have me be\nfalse. Had you doubled the property instead of lessening it, I could\nnot regard what you say any more.\"\n\n\"I should be able to speak in a very different tone; I feel that,\nFrank.\"\n\n\"Do not feel it any more, sir; say what you wish, as you would have\nsaid it under any other circumstances; and pray believe this, the\nidea never occurs to me, that I have ground of complaint as regards\nthe property; never. Whatever troubles we may have, do not let that\ntrouble you.\"\n\nSoon after this Frank left him. What more was there that could be\nsaid between them? They could not be of one accord; but even yet it\nmight not be necessary that they should quarrel. He went out, and\nroamed by himself through the grounds, rather more in meditation than\nwas his wont.\n\nIf he did marry, how was he to live? He talked of a profession; but\nhad he meant to do as others do, who make their way in professions,\nhe should have thought of that a year or two ago!--or, rather, have\ndone more than think of it. He spoke also of a farm, but even that\ncould not be had in a moment; nor, if it could, would it produce a\nliving. Where was his capital? Where his skill? and he might have\nasked also, where the industry so necessary for such a trade? He\nmight set his father at defiance, and if Mary were equally headstrong\nwith himself, he might marry her. But, what then?\n\nAs he walked slowly about, cutting off the daisies with his stick, he\nmet Mr Oriel, going up to the house, as was now his custom, to dine\nthere and spend the evening, close to Beatrice.\n\n\"How I envy you, Oriel!\" he said. \"What would I not give to have such\na position in the world as yours!\"\n\n\"Thou shalt not covet a man's house, nor his wife,\" said Mr Oriel;\n\"perhaps it ought to have been added, nor his position.\"\n\n\"It wouldn't have made much difference. When a man is tempted, the\nCommandments, I believe, do not go for much.\"\n\n\"Do they not, Frank? That's a dangerous doctrine; and one which, if\nyou had my position, you would hardly admit. But what makes you so\nmuch out of sorts? Your own position is generally considered about\nthe best which the world has to give.\"\n\n\"Is it? Then let me tell you that the world has very little to give.\nWhat can I do? Where can I turn? Oriel, if there be an empty, lying\nhumbug in the world, it is the theory of high birth and pure blood\nwhich some of us endeavour to maintain. Blood, indeed! If my father\nhad been a baker, I should know by this time where to look for my\nlivelihood. As it is, I am told of nothing but my blood. Will my\nblood ever get me half a crown?\"\n\nAnd then the young democrat walked on again in solitude, leaving Mr\nOriel in doubt as to the exact line of argument which he had meant to\ninculcate.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL\n\nThe Two Doctors Change Patients\n\n\nDr Fillgrave still continued his visits to Greshamsbury, for Lady\nArabella had not yet mustered the courage necessary for swallowing\nher pride and sending once more for Dr Thorne. Nothing pleased Dr\nFillgrave more than those visits.\n\nHe habitually attended grander families, and richer people; but then,\nhe had attended them habitually. Greshamsbury was a prize taken from\nthe enemy; it was his rock of Gibraltar, of which he thought much\nmore than of any ordinary Hampshire or Wiltshire which had always\nbeen within his own kingdom.\n\nHe was just starting one morning with his post-horses for\nGreshamsbury, when an impudent-looking groom, with a crooked nose,\ntrotted up to his door. For Joe still had a crooked nose, all the\ndoctor's care having been inefficacious to remedy the evil effects\nof Bridget's little tap with the rolling-pin. Joe had no written\ncredentials, for his master was hardly equal to writing, and\nLady Scatcherd had declined to put herself into further personal\ncommunication with Dr Fillgrave; but he had effrontery enough to\ndeliver any message.\n\n\"Be you Dr Fillgrave?\" said Joe, with one finger just raised to his\ncocked hat.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Dr Fillgrave, with one foot on the step of the carriage,\nbut pausing at the sight of so well-turned-out a servant. \"Yes; I am\nDr Fillgrave.\"\n\n\"Then you be to go to Boxall Hill immediately; before anywhere else.\"\n\n\"Boxall Hill!\" said the doctor, with a very angry frown.\n\n\"Yes; Boxall Hill: my master's place--my master is Sir Louis\nScatcherd, baronet. You've heard of him, I suppose?\"\n\nDr Fillgrave had not his mind quite ready for such an occasion. So he\nwithdrew his foot from the carriage step, and rubbing his hands one\nover another, looked at his own hall door for inspiration. A single\nglance at his face was sufficient to show that no ordinary thoughts\nwere being turned over within his breast.\n\n\"Well!\" said Joe, thinking that his master's name had not altogether\nproduced the magic effect which he had expected; remembering, also,\nhow submissive Greyson had always been, who, being a London doctor,\nmust be supposed to be a bigger man than this provincial fellow.\n\"Do you know as how my master is dying, very like, while you stand\nthere?\"\n\n\"What is your master's disease?\" said the doctor, facing Joe, slowly,\nand still rubbing his hands. \"What ails him? What is the matter with\nhim?\"\n\n\"Oh; the matter with him? Well, to say it out at once then, he do\ntake a drop too much at times, and then he has the horrors--what is\nit they call it? delicious beam-ends, or something of that sort.\"\n\n\"Oh, ah, yes; I know; and tell me, my man, who is attending him?\"\n\n\"Attending him? why, I do, and his mother, that is, her ladyship.\"\n\n\"Yes; but what medical attendant: what doctor?\"\n\n\"Why, there was Greyson, in London, and--\"\n\n\"Greyson!\" and the doctor looked as though a name so medicinally\nhumble had never before struck the tympanum of his ear.\n\n\"Yes; Greyson. And then, down at what's the name of the place, there\nwas Thorne.\"\n\n\"Greshamsbury?\"\n\n\"Yes; Greshamsbury. But he and Thorne didn't hit it off; and so since\nthat he has had no one but myself.\"\n\n\"I will be at Boxall Hill in the course of the morning,\" said Dr\nFillgrave; \"or, rather, you may say, that I will be there at once: I\nwill take it in my way.\" And having thus resolved, he gave his orders\nthat the post-horses should make such a detour as would enable him\nto visit Boxall Hill on his road. \"It is impossible,\" said he to\nhimself, \"that I should be twice treated in such a manner in the same\nhouse.\"\n\nHe was not, however, altogether in a comfortable frame of mind as he\nwas driven up to the hall door. He could not but remember the smile\nof triumph with which his enemy had regarded him in that hall; he\ncould not but think how he had returned fee-less to Barchester, and\nhow little he had gained in the medical world by rejecting Lady\nScatcherd's bank-note. However, he also had had his triumphs since\nthat. He had smiled scornfully at Dr Thorne when he had seen him in\nthe Greshamsbury street; and had been able to tell, at twenty houses\nthrough the county, how Lady Arabella had at last been obliged to\nplace herself in his hands. And he triumphed again when he found\nhimself really standing by Sir Louis Scatcherd's bedside. As for Lady\nScatcherd, she did not even show herself. She kept in her own little\nroom, sending out Hannah to ask him up the stairs; and she only just\ngot a peep at him through the door as she heard the medical creak of\nhis shoes as he again descended.\n\nWe need say but little of his visit to Sir Louis. It mattered\nnothing now, whether it was Thorne, or Greyson, or Fillgrave. And Dr\nFillgrave knew that it mattered nothing: he had skill at least for\nthat--and heart enough also to feel that he would fain have been\nrelieved from this task; would fain have left this patient in the\nhands even of Dr Thorne.\n\nThe name which Joe had given to his master's illness was certainly\nnot a false one. He did find Sir Louis \"in the horrors.\" If any\nfather have a son whose besetting sin is a passion for alcohol, let\nhim take his child to the room of a drunkard when possessed by \"the\nhorrors.\" Nothing will cure him if not that.\n\nI will not disgust my reader by attempting to describe the poor\nwretch in his misery: the sunken, but yet glaring eyes; the emaciated\ncheeks; the fallen mouth; the parched, sore lips; the face, now dry\nand hot, and then suddenly clammy with drops of perspiration; the\nshaking hand, and all but palsied limbs; and worse than this, the\nfearful mental efforts, and the struggles for drink; struggles to\nwhich it is often necessary to give way.\n\nDr Fillgrave soon knew what was to be the man's fate; but he did what\nhe might to relieve it. There, in one big, best bedroom, looking out\nto the north, lay Sir Louis Scatcherd, dying wretchedly. There, in\nthe other big, best bedroom, looking out to the south, had died the\nother baronet about a twelvemonth since, and each a victim to the\nsame sin. To this had come the prosperity of the house of Scatcherd!\n\nAnd then Dr Fillgrave went on to Greshamsbury. It was a long day's\nwork, both for himself and the horses; but then, the triumph of being\ndragged up that avenue compensated for both the expense and the\nlabour. He always put on his sweetest smile as he came near the hall\ndoor, and rubbed his hands in the most complaisant manner of which he\nknew. It was seldom that he saw any of the family but Lady Arabella;\nbut then he desired to see none other, and when he left her in a good\nhumour, was quite content to take his glass of sherry and eat his\nlunch by himself.\n\nOn this occasion, however, the servant at once asked him to go into\nthe dining-room, and there he found himself in the presence of Frank\nGresham. The fact was, that Lady Arabella, having at last decided,\nhad sent for Dr Thorne; and it had become necessary that some one\nshould be entrusted with the duty of informing Dr Fillgrave. That\nsome one must be the squire, or Frank. Lady Arabella would doubtless\nhave preferred a messenger more absolutely friendly to her own side\nof the house; but such messenger there was none: she could not send\nMr Gazebee to see her doctor, and so, of the two evils, she chose the\nleast.\n\n\"Dr Fillgrave,\" said Frank, shaking hands with him very cordially as\nhe came up, \"my mother is so much obliged to you for all your care\nand anxiety on her behalf! and, so indeed, are we all.\"\n\nThe doctor shook hands with him very warmly. This little expression\nof a family feeling on his behalf was the more gratifying, as he had\nalways thought that the males of the Greshamsbury family were still\nwedded to that pseudo-doctor, that half-apothecary who lived in the\nvillage.\n\n\"It has been awfully troublesome to you, coming over all this way, I\nam sure. Indeed, money could not pay for it; my mother feels that. It\nmust cut up your time so much.\"\n\n\"Not at all, Mr Gresham; not at all,\" said the Barchester doctor,\nrising up on his toes proudly as he spoke. \"A person of your mother's\nimportance, you know! I should be happy to go any distance to see\nher.\"\n\n\"Ah! but, Dr Fillgrave, we cannot allow that.\"\n\n\"Mr Gresham, don't mention it.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; but I must,\" said Frank, who thought that he had done\nenough for civility, and was now anxious to come to the point. \"The\nfact is, doctor, that we are very much obliged for what you have\ndone; but, for the future, my mother thinks she can trust to such\nassistance as she can get here in the village.\"\n\nFrank had been particularly instructed to be very careful how he\nmentioned Dr Thorne's name, and, therefore, cleverly avoided it.\n\nGet what assistance she wanted in the village! What words were those\nthat he heard? \"Mr Gresham, eh--hem--perhaps I do not completely--\"\nYes, alas! he had completely understood what Frank had meant that he\nshould understand. Frank desired to be civil, but he had no idea of\nbeating unnecessarily about the bush on such an occasion as this.\n\n\"It's by Sir Omicron's advice, Dr Fillgrave. You see, this man\nhere\"--and he nodded his head towards the doctor's house, being still\nanxious not to pronounce the hideous name--\"has known my mother's\nconstitution for so many years.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr Gresham; of course, if it is wished.\"\n\n\"Yes, Dr Fillgrave, it is wished. Lunch is coming directly:\" and\nFrank rang the bell.\n\n\"Nothing, I thank you, Mr Gresham.\"\n\n\"Do take a glass of sherry.\"\n\n\"Nothing at all, I am very much obliged to you.\"\n\n\"Won't you let the horses get some oats?\"\n\n\"I will return at once, if you please, Mr Gresham.\" And the doctor\ndid return, taking with him, on this occasion, the fee that was\noffered to him. His experience had at any rate taught him so much.\n\nBut though Frank could do this for Lady Arabella, he could not\nreceive Dr Thorne on her behalf. The bitterness of that interview had\nto be borne by herself. A messenger had been sent for him, and he was\nupstairs with her ladyship while his rival was receiving his _cong\u00c3\u00a9_\ndownstairs. She had two objects to accomplish, if it might be\npossible: she had found that high words with the doctor were of\nno avail; but it might be possible that Frank could be saved by\nhumiliation on her part. If she humbled herself before this man,\nwould he consent to acknowledge that his niece was not the fit bride\nfor the heir of Greshamsbury?\n\nThe doctor entered the room where she was lying on her sofa, and\nwalking up to her with a gentle, but yet not constrained step,\ntook the seat beside her little table, just as he had always been\naccustomed to do, and as though there had been no break in their\nintercourse.\n\n\"Well, doctor, you see that I have come back to you,\" she said, with\na faint smile.\n\n\"Or, rather I have come back to you. And, believe me, Lady Arabella,\nI am very happy to do so. There need be no excuses. You were,\ndoubtless, right to try what other skill could do; and I hope it has\nnot been tried in vain.\"\n\nShe had meant to have been so condescending; but now all that was put\nquite beyond her power. It was not easy to be condescending to the\ndoctor: she had been trying all her life, and had never succeeded.\n\n\"I have had Sir Omicron Pie,\" she said.\n\n\"So I was glad to hear. Sir Omicron is a clever man, and has a good\nname. I always recommend Sir Omicron myself.\"\n\n\"And Sir Omicron returns the compliment,\" said she, smiling\ngracefully, \"for he recommends you. He told Mr Gresham that I was\nvery foolish to quarrel with my best friend. So now we are friends\nagain, are we not? You see how selfish I am.\" And she put out her\nhand to him.\n\nThe doctor took her hand cordially, and assured her that he bore her\nno ill-will; that he fully understood her conduct--and that he had\nnever accused her of selfishness. This was all very well and very\ngracious; but, nevertheless, Lady Arabella felt that the doctor\nkept the upper hand in those sweet forgivenesses. Whereas, she had\nintended to keep the upper hand, at least for a while, so that her\nhumiliation might be more effective when it did come.\n\nAnd then the doctor used his surgical lore, as he well knew how to\nuse it. There was an assured confidence about him, an air which\nseemed to declare that he really knew what he was doing. These\nwere very comfortable to his patients, but they were wanting in Dr\nFillgrave. When he had completed his examinations and questions,\nand she had completed her little details and made her answer, she\ncertainly was more at ease than she had been since the doctor had\nlast left her.\n\n\"Don't go yet for a moment,\" she said. \"I have one word to say to\nyou.\"\n\nHe declared that he was not the least in a hurry. He desired nothing\nbetter, he said, than to sit there and talk to her. \"And I owe you a\nmost sincere apology, Lady Arabella.\"\n\n\"A sincere apology!\" said she, becoming a little red. Was he going to\nsay anything about Mary? Was he going to own that he, and Mary, and\nFrank had all been wrong?\n\n\"Yes, indeed. I ought not to have brought Sir Louis Scatcherd here: I\nought to have known that he would have disgraced himself.\"\n\n\"Oh! it does not signify,\" said her ladyship in a tone almost of\ndisappointment. \"I had forgotten it. Mr Gresham and you had more\ninconvenience than we had.\"\n\n\"He is an unfortunate, wretched man--most unfortunate; with an\nimmense fortune which he can never live to possess.\"\n\n\"And who will the money go to, doctor?\"\n\nThis was a question for which Dr Thorne was hardly prepared. \"Go to?\"\nhe repeated. \"Oh, some member of the family, I believe. There are\nplenty of nephews and nieces.\"\n\n\"Yes; but will it be divided, or all go to one?\"\n\n\"Probably to one, I think. Sir Roger had a strong idea of leaving\nit all in one hand.\" If it should happen to be a girl, thought Lady\nArabella, what an excellent opportunity would that be for Frank to\nmarry money!\n\n\"And now, doctor, I want to say one word to you; considering the very\nlong time that we have known each other, it is better that I should\nbe open with you. This estrangement between us and dear Mary has\ngiven us all so much pain. Cannot we do anything to put an end to\nit?\"\n\n\"Well, what can I say, Lady Arabella? That depends so wholly on\nyourself.\"\n\n\"If it depends on me, it shall be done at once.\"\n\nThe doctor bowed. And though he could hardly be said to do so\nstiffly, he did it coldly. His bow seemed to say, \"Certainly; if you\nchoose to make a proper _amende_ it can be done. But I think it is\nvery unlikely that you will do so.\"\n\n\"Beatrice is just going to be married, you know that, doctor.\" The\ndoctor said that he did know it. \"And it will be so pleasant that\nMary should make one of us. Poor Beatrice; you don't know what she\nhas suffered.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the doctor, \"there has been suffering, I am sure;\nsuffering on both sides.\"\n\n\"You cannot wonder that we should be so anxious about Frank, Dr\nThorne; an only son, and the heir to an estate that has been so very\nlong in the family:\" and Lady Arabella put her handkerchief to her\neyes, as though these facts were in themselves melancholy, and not\nto be thought of by a mother without some soft tears. \"Now I wish\nyou could tell me what your views are, in a friendly manner, between\nourselves. You won't find me unreasonable.\"\n\n\"My views, Lady Arabella?\"\n\n\"Yes, doctor; about your niece, you know: you must have views of some\nsort; that's of course. It occurs to me, that perhaps we are all in\nthe dark together. If so, a little candid speaking between you and me\nmay set it all right.\"\n\nLady Arabella's career had not hitherto been conspicuous for candour,\nas far as Dr Thorne had been able to judge of it; but that was no\nreason why he should not respond to so very becoming an invitation\non her part. He had no objection to a little candid speaking; at\nleast, so he declared. As to his views with regard to Mary, they were\nmerely these: that he would make her as happy and comfortable as he\ncould while she remained with him; and that he would give her his\nblessing--for he had nothing else to give her--when she left him;--if\never she should do so.\n\nNow, it will be said that the doctor was not very candid in this;\nnot more so, perhaps, than was Lady Arabella herself. But when one\nis specially invited to be candid, one is naturally set upon one's\nguard. Those who by disposition are most open, are apt to become\ncrafty when so admonished. When a man says to you, \"Let us be candid\nwith each other,\" you feel instinctively that he desires to squeeze\nyou without giving a drop of water himself.\n\n\"Yes; but about Frank,\" said Lady Arabella.\n\n\"About Frank!\" said the doctor, with an innocent look, which her\nladyship could hardly interpret.\n\n\"What I mean is this: can you give me your word that these young\npeople do not intend to do anything rash? One word like that from\nyou will set my mind quite at rest. And then we could be so happy\ntogether again.\"\n\n\"Ah! who is to answer for what rash things a young man will do?\" said\nthe doctor, smiling.\n\nLady Arabella got up from the sofa, and pushed away the little table.\nThe man was false, hypocritical, and cunning. Nothing could be made\nof him. They were all in a conspiracy together to rob her of her son;\nto make him marry without money! What should she do? Where should\nshe turn for advice or counsel? She had nothing more to say to the\ndoctor; and he, perceiving that this was the case, took his leave.\nThis little attempt to achieve candour had not succeeded.\n\nDr Thorne had answered Lady Arabella as had seemed best to him on the\nspur of the moment; but he was by no means satisfied with himself.\nAs he walked away through the gardens, he bethought himself whether\nit would be better for all parties if he could bring himself to be\nreally candid. Would it not be better for him at once to tell the\nsquire what were the future prospects of his niece, and let the\nfather agree to the marriage, or not agree to it, as he might think\nfit. But then, if so, if he did do this, would he not in fact say,\n\"There is my niece, there is this girl of whom you have been talking\nfor the last twelvemonth, indifferent to what agony of mind you may\nhave occasioned to her; there she is, a probable heiress! It may be\nworth your son's while to wait a little time, and not cast her off\ntill he shall know whether she be an heiress or no. If it shall turn\nout that she is rich, let him take her; if not, why, he can desert\nher then as well as now.\" He could not bring himself to put his niece\ninto such a position as this. He was anxious enough that she should\nbe Frank Gresham's wife, for he loved Frank Gresham; he was anxious\nenough, also, that she should give to her husband the means of saving\nthe property of his family. But Frank, though he might find her rich,\nwas bound to take her while she was poor.\n\nThen, also, he doubted whether he would be justified in speaking\nof this will at all. He almost hated the will for the trouble and\nvexation it had given him, and the constant stress it had laid on his\nconscience. He had spoken of it as yet to no one, and he thought that\nhe was resolved not to do so while Sir Louis should yet be in the\nland of the living.\n\nOn reaching home, he found a note from Lady Scatcherd, informing him\nthat Dr Fillgrave had once more been at Boxall Hill, and that, on\nthis occasion, he had left the house without anger.\n\n\"I don't know what he has said about Louis,\" she added, \"for, to\ntell the truth, doctor, I was afraid to see him. But he comes again\nto-morrow, and then I shall be braver. But I fear that my poor boy is\nin a bad way.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI\n\nDoctor Thorne Won't Interfere\n\n\nAt this period there was, as it were, a truce to the ordinary little\nskirmishes which had been so customary between Lady Arabella and\nthe squire. Things had so fallen out, that they neither of them had\nmuch spirit for a contest; and, moreover, on that point which at\nthe present moment was most thought of by both of them, they were\nstrangely in unison. For each of them was anxious to prevent the\nthreatened marriage of their only son.\n\nIt must, moreover, be remembered, that Lady Arabella had carried a\ngreat point in ousting Mr Yates Umbleby and putting the management of\nthe estate into the hands of her own partisan. But then the squire\nhad not done less in getting rid of Fillgrave and reinstating Dr\nThorne in possession of the family invalids. The losses, therefore,\nhad been equal; the victories equal; and there was a mutual object.\n\nAnd it must be confessed, also, that Lady Arabella's taste for\ngrandeur was on the decline. Misfortune was coming too near to her to\nleave her much anxiety for the gaieties of a London season. Things\nwere not faring well with her. When her eldest daughter was going to\nmarry a man of fortune, and a member of Parliament, she had thought\nnothing of demanding a thousand pounds or so for the extraordinary\nexpenses incident to such an occasion. But now, Beatrice was to\nbecome the wife of a parish parson, and even that was thought to be\na fortunate event; she had, therefore, no heart for splendour.\n\n\"The quieter we can do it the better,\" she wrote to her\ncountess-sister. \"Her father wanted to give him at least a thousand\npounds; but Mr Gazebee has told me confidentially that it literally\ncannot be done at the present moment! Ah, my dear Rosina! how things\nhave been managed! If one or two of the girls will come over, we\nshall all take it as a favour. Beatrice would think it very kind of\nthem. But I don't think of asking you or Amelia.\" Amelia was always\nthe grandest of the de Courcy family, being almost on an equality\nwith--nay, in some respect superior to--the countess herself. But\nthis, of course, was before the days of the nice place in Surrey.\n\nSuch, and so humble being the present temper of the lady of\nGreshamsbury, it will not be thought surprising that she and Mr\nGresham should at last come together in their efforts to reclaim\ntheir son.\n\nAt first Lady Arabella urged upon the squire the duty of being very\nperemptory and very angry. \"Do as other fathers do in such cases.\nMake him understand that he will have no allowance to live on.\" \"He\nunderstands that well enough,\" said Mr Gresham.\n\n\"Threaten to cut him off with a shilling,\" said her ladyship, with\nspirit. \"I haven't a shilling to cut him off with,\" answered the\nsquire, bitterly.\n\nBut Lady Arabella herself soon perceived, that this line would not\ndo. As Mr Gresham himself confessed, his own sins against his son had\nbeen too great to allow of his taking a high hand with him. Besides,\nMr Gresham was not a man who could ever be severe with a son whose\nindividual conduct had been so good as Frank's. This marriage was, in\nhis view, a misfortune to be averted if possible,--to be averted by\nany possible means; but, as far as Frank was concerned, it was to be\nregarded rather as a monomania than a crime.\n\n\"I did feel so certain that he would have succeeded with Miss\nDunstable,\" said the mother, almost crying.\n\n\"I thought it impossible but that at his age a twelvemonth's knocking\nabout the world would cure him,\" said the father.\n\n\"I never heard of a boy being so obstinate about a girl,\" said the\nmother. \"I'm sure he didn't get it from the de Courcys:\" and then,\nagain, they talked it over in all its bearings.\n\n\"But what are they to live upon?\" said Lady Arabella, appealing, as\nit were, to some impersonation of reason. \"That's what I want him to\ntell me. What are they to live upon?\"\n\n\"I wonder whether de Courcy could get him into some embassy?\" said\nthe father. \"He does talk of a profession.\"\n\n\"What! with the girl and all?\" asked Lady Arabella with horror,\nalarmed at the idea of such an appeal being made to her noble\nbrother.\n\n\"No; but before he marries. He might be broken of it that way.\"\n\n\"Nothing will break him,\" said the wretched mother;\n\"nothing--nothing. For my part, I think that he is possessed. Why was\nshe brought here? Oh, dear! oh, dear! Why was she ever brought into\nthis house?\"\n\nThis last question Mr Gresham did not think it necessary to answer.\nThat evil had been done, and it would be useless to dispute it. \"I'll\ntell you what I'll do,\" said he. \"I'll speak to the doctor himself.\"\n\n\"It's not the slightest use,\" said Lady Arabella. \"He will not assist\nus. Indeed, I firmly believe it's all his own doing.\"\n\n\"Oh, nonsense! that really is nonsense, my love.\"\n\n\"Very well, Mr Gresham. What I say is always nonsense, I know; you\nhave always told me so. But yet, see how things have turned out. I\nknew how it would be when she was first brought into the house.\" This\nassertion was rather a stretch on the part of Lady Arabella.\n\n\"Well, it is nonsense to say that Frank is in love with the girl at\nthe doctor's bidding.\"\n\n\"I think you know, Mr Gresham, that I don't mean that. What I say is\nthis, that Dr Thorne, finding what an easy fool Frank is--\"\n\n\"I don't think he's at all easy, my love; and certainly is not a\nfool.\"\n\n\"Very well, have it your own way. I'll not say a word more. I'm\nstruggling to do my best, and I'm browbeaten on every side. God knows\nI am not in a state of health to bear it!\" And Lady Arabella bowed\nher head into her pocket-handkerchief.\n\n\"I think, my dear, if you were to see Mary herself it might do some\ngood,\" said the squire, when the violence of his wife's grief had\nsomewhat subsided.\n\n\"What! go and call upon this girl?\"\n\n\"Yes; you can send Beatrice to give her notice, you know. She never\nwas unreasonable, and I do not think that you would find her so. You\nshould tell her, you know--\"\n\n\"Oh, I should know very well what to tell her, Mr Gresham.\"\n\n\"Yes, my love; I'm sure you would; nobody better. But what I mean is,\nthat if you are to do any good, you should be kind in your manner.\nMary Thorne has a spirit that you cannot break. You may perhaps lead,\nbut nobody can drive her.\"\n\nAs this scheme originated with her husband, Lady Arabella could not,\nof course, confess that there was much in it. But, nevertheless,\nshe determined to attempt it, thinking that if anything could be\nefficacious for good in their present misfortunes, it would be her\nown diplomatic powers. It was, therefore, at last settled between\nthem, that he should endeavour to talk over the doctor, and that she\nwould do the same with Mary.\n\n\"And then I will speak to Frank,\" said Lady Arabella. \"As yet he has\nnever had the audacity to open his mouth to me about Mary Thorne,\nthough I believe he declares his love openly to every one else in the\nhouse.\"\n\n\"And I will get Oriel to speak to him,\" said the squire.\n\n\"I think Patience might do more good. I did once think he was getting\nfond of Patience, and I was quite unhappy about it then. Ah, dear! I\nshould be almost pleased at that now.\"\n\nAnd thus it was arranged that all the artillery of Greshamsbury was\nto be brought to bear at once on Frank's love, so as to crush it, as\nit were, by the very weight of metal.\n\nIt may be imagined that the squire would have less scruple in\naddressing the doctor on this matter than his wife would feel; and\nthat his part of their present joint undertaking was less difficult\nthan hers. For he and the doctor had ever been friends at heart. But,\nnevertheless, he did feel much scruple, as, with his stick in hand,\nhe walked down to the little gate which opened out near the doctor's\nhouse.\n\nThis feeling was so strong, that he walked on beyond this door to the\nentrance, thinking of what he was going to do, and then back again.\nIt seemed to be his fate to be depending always on the clemency or\nconsideration of Dr Thorne. At this moment the doctor was imposing\nthe only obstacle which was offered to the sale of a great part of\nhis estate. Sir Louis, through his lawyer, was pressing the doctor to\nsell, and the lawyer was loudly accusing the doctor of delaying to do\nso. \"He has the management of your property,\" said Mr Finnie; \"but he\nmanages it in the interest of his own friend. It is quite clear, and\nwe will expose it.\" \"By all means,\" said Sir Louis. \"It is a d----d\nshame, and it shall be exposed.\" Of all this the squire was aware.\n\nWhen he reached the doctor's house, he was shown into the\ndrawing-room, and found Mary there alone. It had always been his\nhabit to kiss her forehead when he chanced to meet her about the\nhouse at Greshamsbury. She had been younger and more childish then;\nbut even now she was but a child to him, so he kissed her as he had\nbeen wont to do. She blushed slightly as she looked up into his face,\nand said: \"Oh, Mr Gresham, I am so glad to see you here again.\"\n\nAs he looked at her he could not but acknowledge that it was natural\nthat Frank should love her. He had never before seen that she was\nattractive;--had never had an opinion about it. She had grown up\nas a child under his eye; and as she had not had the name of being\nespecially a pretty child, he had never thought on the subject. Now\nhe saw before him a woman whose every feature was full of spirit and\nanimation; whose eye sparkled with more than mere brilliancy; whose\nface was full of intelligence; whose very smile was eloquent. Was it\nto be wondered at that Frank should have learned to love her?\n\nMiss Thorne wanted but one attribute which many consider essential\nto feminine beauty. She had no brilliancy of complexion, no pearly\nwhiteness, no vivid carnation; nor, indeed, did she possess the dark\nbrilliance of a brunette. But there was a speaking earnestness in her\nface; an expression of mental faculty which the squire now for the\nfirst time perceived to be charming.\n\nAnd then he knew how good she was. He knew well what was her nature;\nhow generous, how open, how affectionate, and yet how proud! Her\npride was her fault; but even that was not a fault in his eyes. Out\nof his own family there was no one whom he had loved, and could love,\nas he loved her. He felt, and acknowledged that no man could have a\nbetter wife. And yet he was there with the express object of rescuing\nhis son from such a marriage!\n\n\"You are looking very well, Mary,\" he said, almost involuntarily.\n\"Am I?\" she answered, smiling. \"It's very nice at any rate to be\ncomplimented. Uncle never pays me any compliments of that sort.\"\n\nIn truth, she was looking well. She would say to herself over\nand over again, from morning to night, that Frank's love for her\nwould be, must be, unfortunate; could not lead to happiness. But,\nnevertheless, it did make her happy. She had before his return made\nup her mind to be forgotten, and it was so sweet to find that he had\nbeen so far from forgetting her. A girl may scold a man in words for\nrashness in his love, but her heart never scolds him for such an\noffence as that. She had not been slighted, and her heart, therefore,\nstill rose buoyant within her breast.\n\nThe doctor entered the room. As the squire's visit had been expected\nby him, he had of course not been out of the house. \"And now I\nsuppose I must go,\" said Mary; \"for I know you are going to talk\nabout business. But, uncle, Mr Gresham says I'm looking very well.\nWhy have you not been able to find that out?\"\n\n\"She's a dear, good girl,\" said the squire, as the door shut behind\nher; \"a dear good girl;\" and the doctor could not fail to see that\nhis eyes were filled with tears.\n\n\"I think she is,\" said he, quietly. And then they both sat silent, as\nthough each was waiting to hear whether the other had anything more\nto say on that subject. The doctor, at any rate, had nothing more to\nsay.\n\n\"I have come here specially to speak to you about her,\" said the\nsquire.\n\n\"About Mary?\"\n\n\"Yes, doctor; about her and Frank: something must be done, some\narrangement made: if not for our sakes, at least for theirs.\"\n\n\"What arrangement, squire?\"\n\n\"Ah! that is the question. I take it for granted that either Frank or\nMary has told you that they have engaged themselves to each other.\"\n\n\"Frank told me so twelve months since.\"\n\n\"And has not Mary told you?\"\n\n\"Not exactly that. But, never mind; she has, I believe, no secret\nfrom me. Though I have said but little to her, I think I know it\nall.\"\n\n\"Well, what then?\"\n\nThe doctor shook his head and put up his hands. He had nothing to\nsay; no proposition to make; no arrangement to suggest. The thing was\nso, and he seemed to say that, as far as he was concerned, there was\nan end of it.\n\nThe squire sat looking at him, hardly knowing how to proceed. It\nseemed to him, that the fact of a young man and a young lady being in\nlove with each other was not a thing to be left to arrange itself,\nparticularly, seeing the rank of life in which they were placed. But\nthe doctor seemed to be of a different opinion.\n\n\"But, Dr Thorne, there is no man on God's earth who knows my affairs\nas well as you do; and in knowing mine, you know Frank's. Do you\nthink it possible that they should marry each other?\"\n\n\"Possible; yes, it is possible. You mean, will it be prudent?\"\n\n\"Well, take it in that way; would it not be most imprudent?\"\n\n\"At present, it certainly would be. I have never spoken to either of\nthem on the subject; but I presume they do not think of such a thing\nfor the present.\"\n\n\"But, doctor--\" The squire was certainly taken aback by the coolness\nof the doctor's manner. After all, he, the squire, was Mr Gresham\nof Greshamsbury, generally acknowledged to be the first commoner in\nBarsetshire; after all, Frank was his heir, and, in process of time,\nhe would be Mr Gresham of Greshamsbury. Crippled as the estate was,\nthere would be something left, and the rank at any rate remained. But\nas to Mary, she was not even the doctor's daughter. She was not only\npenniless, but nameless, fatherless, worse than motherless! It was\nincredible that Dr Thorne, with his generally exalted ideas as to\nfamily, should speak in this cold way as to a projected marriage\nbetween the heir of Greshamsbury and his brother's bastard child!\n\n\"But, doctor,\" repeated the squire.\n\nThe doctor put one leg over the other, and began to rub his calf.\n\"Squire,\" said he. \"I think I know all that you would say, all that\nyou mean. And you don't like to say it, because you would not wish to\npain me by alluding to Mary's birth.\"\n\n\"But, independently of that, what would they live on?\" said the\nsquire, energetically. \"Birth is a great thing, a very great thing.\nYou and I think exactly alike about that, so we need have no dispute.\nYou are quite as proud of Ullathorne as I am of Greshamsbury.\"\n\n\"I might be if it belonged to me.\"\n\n\"But you are. It is no use arguing. But, putting that aside\naltogether, what would they live on? If they were to marry, what\nwould they do? Where would they go? You know what Lady Arabella\nthinks of such things; would it be possible that they should live up\nat the house with her? Besides, what a life would that be for both of\nthem! Could they live here? Would that be well for them?\"\n\nThe squire looked at the doctor for an answer; but he still went on\nrubbing his calf. Mr Gresham, therefore, was constrained to continue\nhis expostulation.\n\n\"When I am dead there will still, I hope, be something;--something\nleft for the poor fellow. Lady Arabella and the girls would be better\noff, perhaps, than now, and I sometimes wish, for Frank's sake, that\nthe time had come.\"\n\nThe doctor could not now go on rubbing his leg. He was moved to\nspeak, and declared that, of all events, that was the one which would\nbe furthest from Frank's heart. \"I know no son,\" said he, \"who loves\nhis father more dearly than he does.\"\n\n\"I do believe it,\" said the squire; \"I do believe it. But yet, I\ncannot but feel that I am in his way.\"\n\n\"No, squire, no; you are in no one's way. You will find yourself\nhappy with your son yet, and proud of him. And proud of his wife,\ntoo. I hope so, and I think so: I do, indeed, or I should not say so,\nsquire; we will have many a happy day yet together, when we shall\ntalk of all these things over the dining-room fire at Greshamsbury.\"\n\nThe squire felt it kind in the doctor that he should thus endeavour\nto comfort him; but he could not understand, and did not inquire, on\nwhat basis these golden hopes was founded. It was necessary, however,\nto return to the subject which he had come to discuss. Would the\ndoctor assist him in preventing this marriage? That was now the one\nthing necessary to be kept in view.\n\n\"But, doctor, about the young people; of course they cannot marry,\nyou are aware of that.\"\n\n\"I don't know that exactly.\"\n\n\"Well, doctor, I must say I thought you would feel it.\"\n\n\"Feel what, squire?\"\n\n\"That, situated as they are, they ought not to marry.\"\n\n\"That is quite another question. I have said nothing about that\neither to you or to anybody else. The truth is, squire, I have never\ninterfered in this matter one way or the other; and I have no wish to\ndo so now.\"\n\n\"But should you not interfere? Is not Mary the same to you as your\nown child?\"\n\nDr Thorne hardly knew how to answer this. He was aware that his\nargument about not interfering was in fact absurd. Mary could not\nmarry without his interference; and had it been the case that she\nwas in danger of making an improper marriage, of course he would\ninterfere. His meaning was, that he would not at the present moment\nexpress any opinion; he would not declare against a match which\nmight turn out to be in every way desirable; nor, if he spoke in\nfavour of it, could he give his reasons for doing so. Under these\ncircumstances, he would have wished to say nothing, could that only\nhave been possible.\n\nBut as it was not possible, and as he must say something, he answered\nthe squire's last question by asking another. \"What is your\nobjection, squire?\"\n\n\"Objection! Why, what on earth would they live on?\"\n\n\"Then I understand, that if that difficulty were over, you would not\nrefuse your consent merely because of Mary's birth?\"\n\nThis was a manner in which the squire had by no means expected to\nhave the affair presented to him. It seemed so impossible that any\nsound-minded man should take any but his view of the case, that he\nhad not prepared himself for argument. There was every objection to\nhis son marrying Miss Thorne; but the fact of their having no income\nbetween them, did certainly justify him in alleging that first.\n\n\"But that difficulty can't be got over, doctor. You know, however,\nthat it would be cause of grief to us all to see Frank marry much\nbeneath his station; that is, I mean, in family. You should not press\nme to say this, for you know that I love Mary dearly.\"\n\n\"But, my dear friend, it is necessary. Wounds sometimes must be\nopened in order that they may be healed. What I mean is this;--and,\nsquire, I'm sure I need not say to you that I hope for an honest\nanswer,--were Mary Thorne an heiress; had she, for instance, such\nwealth as that Miss Dunstable that we hear of; in that case would you\nobject to the match?\"\n\nWhen the doctor declared that he expected an honest answer the squire\nlistened with all his ears; but the question, when finished, seemed\nto have no bearing on the present case.\n\n\"Come, squire, speak your mind faithfully. There was some talk once\nof Frank's marrying Miss Dunstable; did you mean to object to that\nmatch?\"\n\n\"Miss Dunstable was legitimate; at least, I presume so.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr Gresham! has it come to that? Miss Dunstable, then, would\nhave satisfied your ideas of high birth?\"\n\nMr Gresham was rather posed, and regretted, at the moment, his\nallusion to Miss Dunstable's presumed legitimacy. But he soon\nrecovered himself. \"No,\" said he, \"it would not. And I am willing\nto admit, as I have admitted before, that the undoubted advantages\narising from wealth are taken by the world as atoning for what\notherwise would be a _m\u00c3\u00a9salliance_. But--\"\n\n\"You admit that, do you? You acknowledge that as your conviction on\nthe subject?\"\n\n\"Yes. But--\" The squire was going on to explain the propriety of this\nopinion, but the doctor uncivilly would not hear him.\n\n\"Then squire, I will not interfere in this matter one way or the\nother.\"\n\n\"How on earth can such an opinion--\"\n\n\"Pray excuse me, Mr Gresham; but my mind is now quite made up. It was\nvery nearly so before. I will do nothing to encourage Frank, nor will\nI say anything to discourage Mary.\"\n\n\"That is the most singular resolution that a man of sense like you\never came to.\"\n\n\"I can't help it, squire; it is my resolution.\"\n\n\"But what has Miss Dunstable's fortune to do with it?\"\n\n\"I cannot say that it has anything; but, in this matter, I will not\ninterfere.\"\n\nThe squire went on for some time, but it was all to no purpose;\nand at last he left the house, considerably in dudgeon. The only\nconclusion to which he could come was, that Dr Thorne had thought the\nchance on his niece's behalf too good to be thrown away, and had,\ntherefore, resolved to act in this very singular way.\n\n\"I would not have believed it of him, though all Barsetshire had told\nme,\" he said to himself as he entered the great gates; and he went on\nrepeating the same words till he found himself in his own room. \"No,\nnot if all Barsetshire had told me!\"\n\nHe did not, however, communicate the ill result of his visit to the\nLady Arabella.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII\n\nWhat Can You Give in Return?\n\n\nIn spite of the family troubles, these were happy days for Beatrice.\nIt so seldom happens that young ladies on the eve of their marriage\nhave their future husbands living near them. This happiness was hers,\nand Mr Oriel made the most of it. She was constantly being coaxed\ndown to the parsonage by Patience, in order that she might give her\nopinion, in private, as to some domestic arrangement, some piece of\nfurniture, or some new carpet; but this privacy was always invaded.\nWhat Mr Oriel's parishioners did in these halcyon days, I will not\nask. His morning services, however, had been altogether given up, and\nhe had provided himself with a very excellent curate.\n\nBut one grief did weigh heavily on Beatrice. She continually heard\nher mother say things which made her feel that it would be more than\never impossible that Mary should be at her wedding; and yet she had\npromised her brother to ask her. Frank had also repeated his threat,\nthat if Mary were not present, he would absent himself.\n\nBeatrice did what most girls do in such a case; what all would do who\nare worth anything; she asked her lover's advice.\n\n\"Oh! but Frank can't be in earnest,\" said the lover. \"Of course he'll\nbe at our wedding.\"\n\n\"You don't know him, Caleb. He is so changed that no one hardly\nwould know him. You can't conceive how much in earnest he is, how\ndetermined and resolute. And then, I should like to have Mary so much\nif mamma would let her come.\"\n\n\"Ask Lady Arabella,\" said Caleb.\n\n\"Well, I suppose I must do that; but I know what she'll say, and\nFrank will never believe that I have done my best.\" Mr Oriel\ncomforted her with such little whispered consolations as he was able\nto afford, and then she went away on her errand to her mother.\n\nShe was indeed surprised at the manner in which her prayer was\nreceived. She could hardly falter forth her petition; but when she\nhad done so, Lady Arabella answered in this wise:--\n\n\"Well my dear, I have no objection, none the least; that is, of\ncourse, if Mary is disposed to behave herself properly.\"\n\n\"Oh, mamma! of course she will,\" said Beatrice; \"she always did and\nalways does.\"\n\n\"I hope she will, my love. But, Beatrice, when I say that I shall be\nglad to see her, of course I mean under certain conditions. I never\ndisliked Mary Thorne, and if she would only let Frank understand that\nshe will not listen to his mad proposals, I should be delighted to\nsee her at Greshamsbury just as she used to be.\"\n\nBeatrice could say nothing in answer to this; but she felt very sure\nthat Mary, let her intention be what it might, would not undertake to\nmake Frank understand anything at anybody's bidding.\n\n\"I will tell you what I will do, my dear,\" continued Lady Arabella;\n\"I will call on Mary myself.\"\n\n\"What! at Dr Thorne's house?\"\n\n\"Yes; why not? I have been at Dr Thorne's house before now.\" And\nLady Arabella could not but think of her last visit thither, and the\nstrong feeling she had, as she came out, that she would never again\nenter those doors. She was, however, prepared to do anything on\nbehalf of her rebellious son.\n\n\"Oh, yes! I know that, mamma.\"\n\n\"I will call upon her, and if I can possibly manage it, I will ask her\nmyself to make one of your party. If so, you can go to her afterwards\nand make your own arrangements. Just write her a note, my dear, and\nsay that I will call to-morrow at twelve. It might fluster her if I\nwere to go in without notice.\"\n\nBeatrice did as she was bid, but with a presentiment that no good\nwould come of it. The note was certainly unnecessary for the purpose\nassigned by Lady Arabella, as Mary was not given to be flustered by\nsuch occurrences; but, perhaps, it was as well that it was written,\nas it enabled her to make up her mind steadily as to what information\nshould be given, and what should not be given to her coming visitor.\n\nOn the next morning, at the appointed hour, Lady Arabella walked down\nto the doctor's house. She never walked about the village without\nmaking some little disturbance among the inhabitants. With the\nsquire, himself, they were quite familiar, and he could appear and\nreappear without creating any sensation; but her ladyship had not\nmade herself equally common in men's sight. Therefore, when she\nwent in at the doctor's little gate, the fact was known through all\nGreshamsbury in ten minutes, and before she had left the house, Mrs\nUmbleby and Miss Gushing had quite settled between them what was the\nexact cause of the very singular event.\n\nThe doctor, when he had heard what was going to happen, carefully\nkept out of the way: Mary, therefore, had the pleasure of\nreceiving Lady Arabella alone. Nothing could exceed her ladyship's\naffability. Mary thought that it perhaps might have savoured less\nof condescension; but then, on this subject, Mary was probably\nprejudiced. Lady Arabella smiled and simpered, and asked after the\ndoctor, and the cat, and Janet, and said everything that could have\nbeen desired by any one less unreasonable than Mary Thorne.\n\n\"And now, Mary, I'll tell you why I have called.\" Mary bowed her\nhead slightly, as much to say, that she would be glad to receive any\ninformation that Lady Arabella could give her on that subject. \"Of\ncourse you know that Beatrice is going to be married very shortly.\"\n\nMary acknowledged that she had heard so much.\n\n\"Yes: we think it will be in September--early in September--and that\nis coming very soon now. The poor girl is anxious that you should be\nat her wedding.\" Mary turned slightly red; but she merely said, and\nthat somewhat too coldly, that she was much indebted to Beatrice for\nher kindness.\n\n\"I can assure you, Mary, that she is very fond of you, as much so as\never; and so, indeed, am I, and all of us are so. You know that Mr\nGresham was always your friend.\"\n\n\"Yes, he always was, and I am grateful to Mr Gresham,\" answered Mary.\nIt was well for Lady Arabella that she had her temper under command,\nfor had she spoken her mind out there would have been very little\nchance left for reconciliation between her and Mary.\n\n\"Yes, indeed he was; and I think we all did what little we could\nto make you welcome at Greshamsbury, Mary, till those unpleasant\noccurrences took place.\"\n\n\"What occurrences, Lady Arabella?\"\n\n\"And Beatrice is so very anxious on this point,\" said her ladyship,\nignoring for the moment Mary's question. \"You two have been so much\ntogether, that she feels she cannot be quite happy if you are not\nnear her when she is being married.\"\n\n\"Dear Beatrice!\" said Mary, warmed for the moment to an expression of\ngenuine feeling.\n\n\"She came to me yesterday, begging that I would waive any objection I\nmight have to your being there. I have made her no answer yet. What\nanswer do you think I ought to make her?\"\n\nMary was astounded at this question, and hesitated in her reply.\n\"What answer ought you to make her?\" she said.\n\n\"Yes, Mary. What answer do you think I ought to give? I wish to ask\nyou the question, as you are the person the most concerned.\"\n\nMary considered for a while, and then did give her opinion on the\nmatter in a firm voice. \"I think you should tell Beatrice, that as\nyou cannot at present receive me cordially in your house, it will be\nbetter that you should not be called on to receive me at all.\"\n\nThis was certainly not the sort of answer that Lady Arabella\nexpected, and she was now somewhat astounded in her turn. \"But,\nMary,\" she said, \"I should be delighted to receive you cordially if\nI could do so.\"\n\n\"But it seems you cannot, Lady Arabella; and so there must be an end\nof it.\"\n\n\"Oh, but I do not know that:\" and she smiled her sweetest smile. \"I\ndo not know that. I want to put an end to all this ill-feeling if I\ncan. It all depends upon one thing, you know.\"\n\n\"Does it, Lady Arabella?\"\n\n\"Yes, upon one thing. You won't be angry if I ask you another\nquestion--eh, Mary?\"\n\n\"No; at least I don't think I will.\"\n\n\"Is there any truth in what we hear about your being engaged to\nFrank?\"\n\nMary made no immediate answer to this, but sat quite silent, looking\nLady Arabella in the face; not but that she had made up her mind as\nto what answer she would give, but the exact words failed her at the\nmoment.\n\n\"Of course you must have heard of such a rumour,\" continued Lady\nArabella.\n\n\"Oh, yes, I have heard of it.\"\n\n\"Yes, and you have noticed it, and I must say very properly. When you\nwent to Boxall Hill, and before that with Miss Oriel's to her aunt's,\nI thought you behaved extremely well.\" Mary felt herself glow with\nindignation, and began to prepare words that should be sharp and\ndecisive. \"But, nevertheless, people talk; and Frank, who is still\nquite a boy\" (Mary's indignation was not softened by this allusion\nto Frank's folly), \"seems to have got some nonsense in his head. I\ngrieve to say it, but I feel myself in justice bound to do so, that\nin this matter he has not acted as well as you have done. Now,\ntherefore, I merely ask you whether there is any truth in the report.\nIf you tell me that there is none, I shall be quite contented.\"\n\n\"But it is altogether true, Lady Arabella; I am engaged to Frank\nGresham.\"\n\n\"Engaged to be married to him?\"\n\n\"Yes; engaged to be married to him.\"\n\nWhat was to say or do now? Nothing could be more plain, more decided,\nor less embarrassed with doubt than Mary's declaration. And as she\nmade it she looked her visitor full in the face, blushing indeed, for\nher cheeks were now suffused as well as her forehead; but boldly,\nand, as it were, with defiance.\n\n\"And you tell me so to my face, Miss Thorne?\"\n\n\"And why not? Did you not ask me the question; and would you have me\nanswer you with a falsehood? I am engaged to him. As you would put\nthe question to me, what other answer could I make? The truth is,\nthat I am engaged to him.\"\n\nThe decisive abruptness with which Mary declared her own iniquity\nalmost took away her ladyship's breath. She had certainly believed\nthat they were engaged, and had hardly hoped that Mary would deny it;\nbut she had not expected that the crime would be acknowledged, or, at\nany rate, if acknowledged, that the confession would be made without\nsome show of shame. On this Lady Arabella could have worked; but\nthere was no such expression, nor was there the slightest hesitation.\n\"I am engaged to Frank Gresham,\" and having so said, Mary looked her\nvisitor full in the face.\n\n\"Then it is indeed impossible that you should be received at\nGreshamsbury.\"\n\n\"At present, quite so, no doubt: in saying so, Lady Arabella, you\nonly repeat the answer I made to your first question. I can now go\nto Greshamsbury only in one light: that of Mr Gresham's accepted\ndaughter-in-law.\"\n\n\"And that is perfectly out of the question; altogether out of the\nquestion, now and for ever.\"\n\n\"I will not dispute with you about that; but, as I said before, my\nbeing at Beatrice's wedding is not to be thought of.\"\n\nLady Arabella sat for a while silent, that she might meditate, if\npossible, calmly as to what line of argument she had now better take.\nIt would be foolish in her, she thought, to return home, having\nmerely expressed her anger. She had now an opportunity of talking to\nMary which might not again occur: the difficulty was in deciding in\nwhat special way she should use the opportunity. Should she threaten,\nor should she entreat? To do her justice, it should be stated, that\nshe did actually believe that the marriage was all but impossible;\nshe did not think that it could take place. But the engagement might\nbe the ruin of her son's prospects, seeing how he had before him one\nimperative, one immediate duty--that of marrying money.\n\nHaving considered all this as well as her hurry would allow her,\nshe determined first to reason, then to entreat, and lastly, if\nnecessary, to threaten.\n\n\"I am astonished! you cannot be surprised at that, Miss Thorne: I am\nastonished at hearing so singular a confession made.\"\n\n\"Do you think my confession singular, or is it the fact of my being\nengaged to your son?\"\n\n\"We will pass over that for the present. But do let me ask you, do\nyou think it possible, I say possible, that you and Frank should be\nmarried?\"\n\n\"Oh, certainly; quite possible.\"\n\n\"Of course you know that he has not a shilling in the world.\"\n\n\"Nor have I, Lady Arabella.\"\n\n\"Nor will he have were he to do anything so utterly hostile to his\nfather's wishes. The property, you are aware, is altogether at Mr\nGresham's disposal.\"\n\n\"I am aware of nothing about the property, and can say nothing about\nit except this, that it has not been, and will not be inquired after\nby me in this matter. If I marry Frank Gresham, it will not be for\nthe property. I am sorry to make such an apparent boast, but you\nforce me to do it.\"\n\n\"On what then are you to live? You are too old for love in a cottage,\nI suppose?\"\n\n\"Not at all too old; Frank, you know is 'still quite a boy.'\"\n\nImpudent hussy! forward, ill-conditioned saucy minx! such were\nthe epithets which rose to Lady Arabella's mind; but she politely\nsuppressed them.\n\n\"Miss Thorne, this subject is of course to me very serious; very\nill-adapted for jesting. I look upon such a marriage as absolutely\nimpossible.\"\n\n\"I do not know what you mean by impossible, Lady Arabella.\"\n\n\"I mean, in the first place, that you two could not get yourselves\nmarried.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; Mr Oriel would manage that for us. We are his parishioners,\nand he would be bound to do it.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon; I believe that under all the circumstances it\nwould be illegal.\"\n\nMary smiled; but she said nothing. \"You may laugh, Miss Thorne, but I\nthink you will find that I am right. There are still laws to prevent\nsuch fearful distress as would be brought about by such a marriage.\"\n\n\"I hope that nothing I shall do will bring distress on the family.\"\n\n\"Ah, but it would; don't you know that it would? Think of it, Miss\nThorne. Think of Frank's state, and of his father's state. You know\nenough of that, I am sure, to be well aware that Frank is not in a\ncondition to marry without money. Think of the position which Mr\nGresham's only son should hold in the county; think of the old name,\nand the pride we have in it; you have lived among us enough to\nunderstand all this; think of these things, and then say whether it\nis possible such a marriage should take place without family distress\nof the deepest kind. Think of Mr Gresham; if you truly love my son,\nyou could not wish to bring on him all this misery and ruin.\"\n\nMary now was touched, for there was truth in what Lady Arabella said.\nBut she had no power of going back; her troth was plighted, and\nnothing that any human being could say should shake her from it. If\nhe, indeed, chose to repent, that would be another thing.\n\n\"Lady Arabella,\" she said, \"I have nothing to say in favour of this\nengagement, except that he wishes it.\"\n\n\"And is that a reason, Mary?\"\n\n\"To me it is; not only a reason, but a law. I have given him my\npromise.\"\n\n\"And you will keep your promise even to his own ruin?\"\n\n\"I hope not. Our engagement, unless he shall choose to break it off,\nmust necessarily be a long one; but the time will come--\"\n\n\"What! when Mr Gresham is dead?\"\n\n\"Before that, I hope.\"\n\n\"There is no probability of it. And because he is headstrong, you,\nwho have always had credit for so much sense, will hold him to this\nmad engagement?\"\n\n\"No, Lady Arabella; I will not hold him to anything to which he does\nnot wish to be held. Nothing that you can say shall move me: nothing\nthat anybody can say shall induce me to break my promise to him. But\na word from himself will do it. One look will be sufficient. Let him\ngive me to understand, in any way, that his love for me is injurious\nto him--that he has learnt to think so--and then I will renounce my\npart in this engagement as quickly as you could wish it.\"\n\nThere was much in this promise, but still not so much as Lady\nArabella wished to get. Mary, she knew, was obstinate, but yet\nreasonable; Frank, she thought, was both obstinate and unreasonable.\nIt might be possible to work on Mary's reason, but quite impossible\nto touch Frank's irrationality. So she persevered--foolishly.\n\n\"Miss Thorne--that, is, Mary, for I still wish to be thought your\nfriend--\"\n\n\"I will tell you the truth, Lady Arabella: for some considerable time\npast I have not thought you so.\"\n\n\"Then you have wronged me. But I will go on with what I was saying.\nYou quite acknowledge that this is a foolish affair?\"\n\n\"I acknowledge no such thing.\"\n\n\"Something very much like it. You have not a word in its defence.\"\n\n\"Not to you: I do not choose to be put on my defence by you.\"\n\n\"I don't know who has more right; however, you promise that if Frank\nwishes it, you will release him from his engagement.\"\n\n\"Release him! It is for him to release me, that is, if he wishes it.\"\n\n\"Very well; at any rate, you give him permission to do so. But will\nit not be more honourable for you to begin?\"\n\n\"No; I think not.\"\n\n\"Ah, but it would. If he, in his position, should be the first to\nspeak, the first to suggest that this affair between you is a foolish\none, what would people say?\"\n\n\"They would say the truth.\"\n\n\"And what would you yourself say?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"What would he think of himself?\"\n\n\"Ah, that I do not know. It is according as that may be, that he will\nor will not act at your bidding.\"\n\n\"Exactly; and because you know him to be high-minded, because you\nthink that he, having so much to give, will not break his word to\nyou--to you who have nothing to give in return--it is, therefore,\nthat you say that the first step must be taken by him. Is that\nnoble?\"\n\nThen Mary rose from her seat, for it was no longer possible for her\nto speak what it was in her to say, sitting there leisurely on her\nsofa. Lady Arabella's worship of money had not hitherto been so\nbrought forward in the conversation as to give her unpardonable\noffence; but now she felt that she could no longer restrain her\nindignation. \"To you who have nothing to give in return!\" Had she not\ngiven all that she possessed? Had she not emptied his store into his\nlap? that heart of hers, beating with such genuine life, capable of\nsuch perfect love, throbbing with so grand a pride; had she not given\nthat? And was it not that, between him and her, more than twenty\nGreshamsburys, nobler than any pedigree? \"To you who have nothing to\ngive,\" indeed! This to her who was so ready to give everything!\n\n\"Lady Arabella,\" she said, \"I think that you do not understand me,\nand that it is not likely that you should. If so, our further talking\nwill be worse than useless. I have taken no account of what will be\ngiven between your son and me in your sense of the word giving. But\nhe has professed to--to love me\"--as she spoke, she still looked on\nthe lady's face, but her eyelashes for a moment screened her eyes,\nand her colour was a little heightened--\"and I have acknowledged that\nI also love him, and so we are engaged. To me my promise is sacred. I\nwill not be threatened into breaking it. If, however, he shall wish\nto change his mind, he can do so. I will not upbraid him; will not,\nif I can help it, think harshly of him. So much you may tell him if\nit suits you; but I will not listen to your calculations as to how\nmuch or how little each of us may have to give to the other.\"\n\nShe was still standing when she finished speaking, and so she\ncontinued to stand. Her eyes were fixed on Lady Arabella, and her\nposition seemed to say that sufficient words had been spoken, and\nthat it was time that her ladyship should go; and so Lady Arabella\nfelt it. Gradually she also rose; slowly, but tacitly, she\nacknowledged that she was in the presence of a spirit superior to her\nown; and so she took her leave.\n\n\"Very well,\" she said, in a tone that was intended to be\ngrandiloquent, but which failed grievously; \"I will tell him that he\nhas your permission to think a second time on this matter. I do not\ndoubt but that he will do so.\" Mary would not condescend to answer,\nbut curtsied low as her visitor left the room. And so the interview\nwas over.\n\nThe interview was over, and Mary was alone. She remained standing as\nlong as she heard the footsteps of Frank's mother on the stairs; not\nimmediately thinking of what had passed, but still buoying herself up\nwith her hot indignation, as though her work with Lady Arabella was\nnot yet finished; but when the footfall was no longer heard, and the\nsound of the closing door told her that she was in truth alone, she\nsank back in her seat, and, covering her face with her hands, burst\ninto bitter tears.\n\nAll that doctrine about money was horrible to her; that insolent\npretence, that she had caught at Frank because of his worldly\nposition, made her all but ferocious; but Lady Arabella had not the\nless spoken much that was true. She did think of the position which\nthe heir of Greshamsbury should hold in the county, and of the fact\nthat a marriage would mar that position so vitally; she did think of\nthe old name, and the old Gresham pride; she did think of the squire\nand his deep distress: it was true that she had lived among them\nlong enough to understand these things, and to know that it was not\npossible that this marriage should take place without deep family\nsorrow.\n\nAnd then she asked herself whether, in consenting to accept Frank's\nhand, she had adequately considered this; and she was forced to\nacknowledge that she had not considered it. She had ridiculed Lady\nArabella for saying that Frank was still a boy; but was it not true\nthat his offer had been made with a boy's energy, rather than a man's\nforethought? If so, if she had been wrong to accede to that offer\nwhen made, would she not be doubly wrong to hold him to it now that\nshe saw their error?\n\nIt was doubtless true that Frank himself could not be the first to\ndraw back. What would people say of him? She could now calmly ask\nherself the question that had so angered her when asked by Lady\nArabella. If he could not do it, and if, nevertheless, it behoved\nthem to break off this match, by whom was it to be done if not\nby her? Was not Lady Arabella right throughout, right in her\nconclusions, though so foully wrong in her manner of drawing them?\n\nAnd then she did think for one moment of herself. \"You who have\nnothing to give in return!\" Such had been Lady Arabella's main\naccusation against her. Was it in fact true that she had nothing to\ngive? Her maiden love, her feminine pride, her very life, and spirit,\nand being--were these things nothing? Were they to be weighed against\npounds sterling per annum? and, when so weighed, were they ever to\nkick the beam like feathers? All these things had been nothing to\nher when, without reflection, governed wholly by the impulse of the\nmoment, she had first allowed his daring hand to lie for an instant\nin her own. She had thought nothing of these things when that other\nsuitor came, richer far than Frank, to love whom it was as impossible\nto her as it was not to love him.\n\nHer love had been pure from all such thoughts; she was conscious\nthat it ever would be pure from them. Lady Arabella was unable to\ncomprehend this, and, therefore, was Lady Arabella so utterly\ndistasteful to her.\n\nFrank had once held her close to his warm breast; and her very soul\nhad thrilled with joy to feel that he so loved her,--with a joy which\nshe had hardly dared to acknowledge. At that moment, her maidenly\nefforts had been made to push him off, but her heart had grown to\nhis. She had acknowledged him to be master of her spirit; her bosom's\nlord; the man whom she had been born to worship; the human being to\nwhom it was for her to link her destiny. Frank's acres had been of no\naccount; nor had his want of acres. God had brought them two together\nthat they should love each other; that conviction had satisfied her,\nand she had made it a duty to herself that she would love him with\nher very soul. And now she was called upon to wrench herself asunder\nfrom him because she had nothing to give in return!\n\nWell, she would wrench herself asunder, as far as such wrenching\nmight be done compatibly with her solemn promise. It might be right\nthat Frank should have an opportunity offered him, so that he might\nescape from his position without disgrace. She would endeavour to\ngive him this opportunity. So, with one deep sigh, she arose, took\nherself pen, ink, and paper, and sat herself down again so that the\nwrenching might begin.\n\nAnd then, for a moment, she thought of her uncle. Why had he not\nspoken to her of all this? Why had he not warned her? He who had ever\nbeen so good to her, why had he now failed her so grievously? She had\ntold him everything, had had no secret from him; but he had never\nanswered her a word. \"He also must have known,\" she said to herself,\npiteously, \"he also must have known that I could give nothing in\nreturn.\" Such accusation, however, availed her not at all, so she sat\ndown and slowly wrote her letter.\n\n\"Dearest Frank,\" she began. She had at first written \"dear Mr\nGresham;\" but her heart revolted against such useless coldness. She\nwas not going to pretend she did not love him.\n\n\n   DEAREST FRANK,\n\n   Your mother has been here talking to me about our\n   engagement. I do not generally agree with her about such\n   matters; but she has said some things to-day which I\n   cannot but acknowledge to be true. She says, that our\n   marriage would be distressing to your father, injurious to\n   all your family, and ruinous to yourself. If this be so,\n   how can I, who love you, wish for such a marriage?\n\n   I remember my promise, and have kept it. I would not\n   yield to your mother when she desired me to disclaim our\n   engagement. But I do think it will be more prudent if\n   you will consent to forget all that has passed between\n   us--not, perhaps, to forget it; that may not be possible\n   for us--but to let it pass by as though it had never\n   been. If so, if you think so, dear Frank, do not have any\n   scruples on my account. What will be best for you, must be\n   best for me. Think what a reflection it would ever be to\n   me, to have been the ruin of one that I love so well.\n\n   Let me have but one word to say that I am released from my\n   promise, and I will tell my uncle that the matter between\n   us is over. It will be painful for us at first; those\n   occasional meetings which must take place will distress\n   us, but that will wear off. We shall always think well\n   of each other, and why should we not be friends? This,\n   doubtless, cannot be done without inward wounds; but such\n   wounds are in God's hands, and He can cure them.\n\n   I know what your first feelings will be on reading this\n   letter; but do not answer it in obedience to first\n   feelings. Think over it, think of your father, and all you\n   owe him, of your old name, your old family, and of what\n   the world expects from you. [Mary was forced to put her\n   hand to her eyes, to save her paper from her falling\n   tears, as she found herself thus repeating, nearly word\n   for word, the arguments that had been used by Lady\n   Arabella.] Think of these things, coolly, if you can, but,\n   at any rate, without passion: and then let me have one\n   word in answer. One word will suffice.\n\n   I have but to add this: do not allow yourself to think\n   that my heart will ever reproach you. It cannot reproach\n   you for doing that which I myself suggest. [Mary's logic\n   in this was very false; but she was not herself aware of\n   it.] I will never reproach you either in word or thought;\n   and as for all others, it seems to me that the world\n   agrees that we have hitherto been wrong. The world, I\n   hope, will be satisfied when we have obeyed it.\n\n   God bless you, dearest Frank! I shall never call you\n   so again; but it would be a pretence were I to write\n   otherwise in this letter. Think of this, and then let me\n   have one line.\n\n   Your affectionate friend,\n\n   MARY THORNE.\n\n   P.S.--Of course I cannot be at dear Beatrice's marriage;\n   but when they come back to the parsonage, I shall see her.\n   I am sure they will both be happy, because they are so\n   good. I need hardly say that I shall think of them on\n   their wedding day.\n\n\nWhen she had finished her letter, she addressed it plainly, in her\nown somewhat bold handwriting, to Francis N. Gresham, Jun., Esq., and\nthen took it herself to the little village post-office. There should\nbe nothing underhand about her correspondence: all the Greshamsbury\nworld should know of it--that world of which she had spoken in her\nletter--if that world so pleased. Having put her penny label on it,\nshe handed it, with an open brow and an unembarrassed face, to the\nbaker's wife, who was Her Majesty's postmistress at Greshamsbury;\nand, having so finished her work, she returned to see the table\nprepared for her uncle's dinner. \"I will say nothing to him,\" said\nshe to herself, \"till I get the answer. He will not talk to me about\nit, so why should I trouble him?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII\n\nThe Race of Scatcherd Becomes Extinct\n\n\nIt will not be imagined, at any rate by feminine readers, that Mary's\nletter was written off at once, without alterations and changes, or\nthe necessity for a fair copy. Letters from one young lady to another\nare doubtless written in this manner, and even with them it might\nsometimes be better if more patience had been taken; but with Mary's\nfirst letter to her lover--her first love-letter, if love-letter it\ncan be called--much more care was used. It was copied and re-copied,\nand when she returned from posting it, it was read and re-read.\n\n\"It is very cold,\" she said to herself; \"he will think I have no\nheart, that I have never loved him!\" And then she all but resolved to\nrun down to the baker's wife, and get back her letter, that she might\nalter it. \"But it will be better so,\" she said again. \"If I touched\nhis feelings now, he would never bring himself to leave me. It is\nright that I should be cold to him. I should be false to myself if\nI tried to move his love--I, who have nothing to give him in return\nfor it.\" And so she made no further visit to the post-office, and the\nletter went on its way.\n\nWe will now follow its fortunes for a short while, and explain how\nit was that Mary received no answer for a week; a week, it may well\nbe imagined, of terrible suspense to her. When she took it to the\npost-office, she doubtless thought that the baker's wife had nothing\nto do but to send it up to the house at Greshamsbury, and that Frank\nwould receive it that evening, or, at latest, early on the following\nmorning. But this was by no means so. The epistle was posted on a\nFriday afternoon, and it behoved the baker's wife to send it into\nSilverbridge--Silverbridge being the post-town--so that all due\nformalities, as ordered by the Queen's Government, might there be\nperfected. Now, unfortunately, the post-boy had taken his departure\nbefore Mary reached the shop, and it was not, therefore, dispatched\ntill Saturday. Sunday was always a _dies non_ with the Greshamsbury\nMercury, and, consequently, Frank's letter was not delivered at the\nhouse till Monday morning; at which time Mary had for two long days\nbeen waiting with weary heart for the expected answer.\n\nNow Frank had on that morning gone up to London by the early train,\nwith his future brother-in-law, Mr Oriel. In order to accomplish\nthis, they had left Greshamsbury for Barchester exactly as the\npostboy was leaving Silverbridge for Greshamsbury.\n\n\"I should like to wait for my letters,\" Mr Oriel had said, when the\njourney was being discussed.\n\n\"Nonsense,\" Frank had answered. \"Who ever got a letter that was worth\nwaiting for?\" and so Mary was doomed to a week of misery.\n\nWhen the post-bag arrived at the house on Monday morning, it was\nopened as usual by the squire himself at the breakfast-table. \"Here\nis a letter for Frank,\" said he, \"posted in the village. You had\nbetter send it to him:\" and he threw the letter across the table to\nBeatrice.\n\n\"It's from Mary,\" said Beatrice, out loud, taking the letter up and\nexamining the address. And having said so, she repented what she had\ndone, as she looked first at her father and then at her mother.\n\nA cloud came over the squire's brow as for a minute he went on\nturning over the letters and newspapers. \"Oh, from Mary Thorne, is\nit?\" he said. \"Well, you had better send it to him.\"\n\n\"Frank said that if any letters came they were to be kept,\" said his\nsister Sophy. \"He told me so particularly. I don't think he likes\nhaving letters sent after him.\"\n\n\"You had better send that one,\" said the squire.\n\n\"Mr Oriel is to have all his letters addressed to Long's Hotel, Bond\nStreet, and this one can very well be sent with them,\" said Beatrice,\nwho knew all about it, and intended herself to make a free use of the\naddress.\n\n\"Yes, you had better send it,\" said the squire; and then nothing\nfurther was said at the table. But Lady Arabella, though she said\nnothing, had not failed to mark what had passed. Had she asked for\nthe letter before the squire, he would probably have taken possession\nof it himself; but as soon as she was alone with Beatrice, she did\ndemand it. \"I shall be writing to Frank myself,\" she said, \"and will\nsend it to him.\" And so, Beatrice, with a heavy heart, gave it up.\n\nThe letter lay before Lady Arabella's eyes all that day, and many a\nwistful glance was cast at it. She turned it over and over, and much\nshe desired to know its contents; but she did not dare to break the\nseal of her son's letter. All that day it lay upon her desk, and all\nthe next, for she could hardly bring herself to part with it; but on\nthe Wednesday it was sent--sent with these lines from herself:--\n\n\"Dearest, dearest Frank, I send you a letter which has come by the\npost from Mary Thorne. I do not know what it may contain; but before\nyou correspond with her, pray, pray think of what I said to you. For\nmy sake, for your father's, for your own, pray think of it.\"\n\nThat was all, but it was enough to make her word to Beatrice true.\nShe did send it to Frank enclosed in a letter from herself. We must\nreserve to the next chapter what had taken place between Frank and\nhis mother; but, for the present, we will return to the doctor's\nhouse.\n\nMary said not a word to him about the letter; but, keeping silent on\nthe subject, she felt wretchedly estranged from him. \"Is anything the\nmatter, Mary?\" he said to her on the Sunday afternoon.\n\n\"No, uncle,\" she answered, turning away her head to hide her tears.\n\n\"Ah, but there is something; what is it, dearest?\"\n\n\"Nothing--that is, nothing that one can talk about.\"\n\n\"What Mary! Be unhappy and not to talk about it to me? That's\nsomething new, is it not?\"\n\n\"One has presentiments sometimes, and is unhappy without knowing why.\nBesides, you know--\"\n\n\"I know! What do I know? Do I know anything that will make my pet\nhappier?\" and he took her in his arms as they sat together on the\nsofa. Her tears were now falling fast, and she no longer made an\neffort to hide them. \"Speak to me, Mary; this is more than a\npresentiment. What is it?\"\n\n\"Oh, uncle--\"\n\n\"Come, love, speak to me; tell me why you are grieving.\"\n\n\"Oh, uncle, why have you not spoken to me? Why have you not told\nme what to do? Why have you not advised me? Why are you always so\nsilent?\"\n\n\"Silent about what?\"\n\n\"You know, uncle, you know; silent about him; silent about Frank.\"\n\nWhy, indeed? What was he to say to this? It was true that he had\nnever counselled her; never shown her what course she should take;\nhad never even spoken to her about her lover. And it was equally true\nthat he was not now prepared to do so, even in answer to such an\nappeal as this. He had a hope, a strong hope, more than a hope, that\nMary's love would yet be happy; but he could not express or explain\nhis hope; nor could he even acknowledge to himself a wish that would\nseem to be based on the death of him whose life he was bound, if\npossible, to preserve.\n\n\"My love,\" he said, \"it is a matter in which you must judge for\nyourself. Did I doubt your conduct, I should interfere; but I do\nnot.\"\n\n\"Conduct! Is conduct everything? One may conduct oneself excellently,\nand yet break one's heart.\"\n\nThis was too much for the doctor; his sternness and firmness\ninstantly deserted him. \"Mary,\" he said, \"I will do anything that you\nwould have me. If you wish it, I will make arrangements for leaving\nthis place at once.\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" she said, plaintively.\n\n\"When you tell me of a broken heart, you almost break my own. Come\nto me, darling; do not leave me so. I will say all that I can say. I\nhave thought, do still think, that circumstances will admit of your\nmarriage with Frank if you both love each other, and can both be\npatient.\"\n\n\"You think so,\" said she, unconsciously sliding her hand into his,\nas though to thank him by its pressure for the comfort he was giving\nher.\n\n\"I do think so now more than ever. But I only think so; I have been\nunable to assure you. There, darling, I must not say more; only that\nI cannot bear to see you grieving, I would not have said this:\" and\nthen he left her, and nothing more was spoken on the subject.\n\nIf you can be patient! Why, a patience of ten years would be as\nnothing to her. Could she but live with the knowledge that she was\nfirst in his estimation, dearest in his heart; could it be also\ngranted to her to feel that she was regarded as his equal, she could\nbe patient for ever. What more did she want than to know and feel\nthis? Patient, indeed!\n\nBut what could these circumstances be to which her uncle had alluded?\n\"I do think that circumstances will admit of your marriage.\" Such was\nhis opinion, and she had never known him to be wrong. Circumstances!\nWhat circumstances? Did he perhaps mean that Mr Gresham's affairs\nwere not so bad as they had been thought to be? If so, that alone\nwould hardly alter the matter, for what could she give in return? \"I\nwould give him the world for one word of love,\" she said to herself,\n\"and never think that he was my debtor. Ah! how beggarly the heart\nmust be that speculates on such gifts as those!\"\n\nBut there was her uncle's opinion: he still thought that they might\nbe married. Oh, why had she sent her letter? and why had she made it\nso cold? With such a letter as that before him, Frank could not do\nother than consent to her proposal. And then, why did he not at least\nanswer it?\n\nOn the Sunday afternoon there arrived at Greshamsbury a man and a\nhorse from Boxall Hill, bearing a letter from Lady Scatcherd to Dr\nThorne, earnestly requesting the doctor's immediate attendance. \"I\nfear everything is over with poor Louis,\" wrote the unhappy mother.\n\"It has been very dreadful. Do come to me; I have no other friend,\nand I am nearly worn through with it. The man from the city\"--she\nmeant Dr Fillgrave--\"comes every day, and I dare say he is all very\nwell, but he has never done much good. He has not had spirit enough\nto keep the bottle from him; and it was that, and that only, that\nmost behoved to be done. I doubt you won't find him in this world\nwhen you arrive here.\"\n\nDr Thorne started immediately. Even though he might have to meet Dr\nFillgrave, he could not hesitate, for he went not as a doctor to the\ndying man, but as the trustee under Sir Roger's will. Moreover, as\nLady Scatcherd had said, he was her only friend, and he could not\ndesert her at such a moment for an army of Fillgraves. He told\nMary he should not return that night; and taking with him a small\nsaddle-bag, he started at once for Boxall Hill.\n\nAs he rode up to the hall door, Dr Fillgrave was getting into his\ncarriage. They had never met so as to speak to each other since that\nmemorable day, when they had their famous passage of arms in the hall\nof that very house before which they both now stood. But, at the\npresent moment, neither of them was disposed to renew the fight.\n\n\"What news of your patient, Dr Fillgrave?\" said our doctor, still\nseated on his sweating horse, and putting his hand lightly to his\nhat.\n\nDr Fillgrave could not refrain from one moment of supercilious\ndisdain: he gave one little chuck to his head, one little twist to\nhis neck, one little squeeze to his lips, and then the man within him\novercame the doctor. \"Sir Louis is no more,\" he said.\n\n\"God's will be done!\" said Dr Thorne.\n\n\"His death is a release; for his last days have been very frightful.\nYour coming, Dr Thorne, will be a comfort to Lady Scatcherd.\" And\nthen Dr Fillgrave, thinking that even the present circumstances\nrequired no further condescension, ensconced himself in the carriage.\n\n\"His last days have been very dreadful! Ah, me, poor fellow! Dr\nFillgrave, before you go, allow me to say this: I am quite aware that\nwhen he fell into your hands, no medical skill in the world could\nsave him.\"\n\nDr Fillgrave bowed low from the carriage, and after this unwonted\nexchange of courtesies, the two doctors parted, not to meet again--at\nany rate, in the pages of this novel. Of Dr Fillgrave, let it now be\nsaid, that he grows in dignity as he grows in years, and that he is\nuniversally regarded as one of the celebrities of the city of\nBarchester.\n\nLady Scatcherd was found sitting alone in her little room on the\nground-floor. Even Hannah was not with her, for Hannah was now\noccupied upstairs. When the doctor entered the room, which he did\nunannounced, he found her seated on a chair, with her back against\none of the presses, her hands clasped together over her knees, gazing\ninto vacancy. She did not ever hear him or see him as he approached,\nand his hand had slightly touched her shoulder before she knew that\nshe was not alone. Then, she looked up at him with a face so full of\nsorrow, so worn with suffering, that his own heart was racked to see\nher.\n\n\"It is all over, my friend,\" said he. \"It is better so; much better\nso.\"\n\nShe seemed at first hardly to understand him, but still regarding him\nwith that wan face, shook her head slowly and sadly. One might have\nthought that she was twenty years older than when Dr Thorne last saw\nher.\n\nHe drew a chair to her side, and sitting by her, took her hand in\nhis. \"It is better so, Lady Scatcherd; better so,\" he repeated. \"The\npoor lad's doom had been spoken, and it is well for him, and for you,\nthat it should be over.\"\n\n\"They are both gone now,\" said she, speaking very low; \"both gone\nnow. Oh, doctor! To be left alone here, all alone!\"\n\nHe said some few words trying to comfort her; but who can comfort\na widow bereaved of her child? Who can console a heart that has\nlost all that it possessed? Sir Roger had not been to her a tender\nhusband; but still he had been the husband of her love. Sir Louis had\nnot been to her an affectionate son; but still he had been her child,\nher only child. Now they were both gone. Who can wonder that the\nworld should be a blank to her?\n\nStill the doctor spoke soothing words, and still he held her hand.\nHe knew that his words could not console her; but the sounds of his\nkindness at such desolate moments are, to such minds as hers, some\nalleviation of grief. She hardly answered him, but sat there staring\nout before her, leaving her hand passively to him, and swaying her\nhead backwards and forwards as though her grief were too heavy to be\nborne.\n\nAt last, her eye rested on an article which stood upon the table, and\nshe started up impetuously from her chair. She did this so suddenly,\nthat the doctor's hand fell beside him before he knew that she had\nrisen. The table was covered with all those implements which become\nso frequent about a house when severe illness is an inhabitant there.\nThere were little boxes and apothecaries' bottles, cups and saucers\nstanding separate, and bowls, in which messes have been prepared with\nthe hope of suiting a sick man's failing appetite. There was a small\nsaucepan standing on a plate, a curiously shaped glass utensil left\nby the doctor, and sundry pieces of flannel, which had been used in\nrubbing the sufferer's limbs. But in the middle of the d\u00c3\u00a9bris stood\none black bottle, with head erect, unsuited to the companionship in\nwhich it was found.\n\n\"There,\" she said, rising up, and seizing this in a manner that\nwould have been ridiculous had it not been so truly tragic. \"There,\nthat has robbed me of everything--of all that I ever possessed; of\nhusband and child; of the father and son; that has swallowed them\nboth--murdered them both! Oh, doctor! that such a thing as that\nshould cause such bitter sorrow! I have hated it always, but now--Oh,\nwoe is me! weary me!\" And then she let the bottle drop from her hand\nas though it were too heavy for her.\n\n\"This comes of their barro-niting,\" she continued. \"If they had let\nhim alone, he would have been here now, and so would the other one.\nWhy did they do it? why did they do it? Ah, doctor! people such as us\nshould never meddle with them above us. See what has come of it; see\nwhat has come of it!\"\n\nThe doctor could not remain with her long, as it was necessary that\nhe should take upon himself the direction of the household, and give\norders for the funeral. First of all, he had to undergo the sad duty\nof seeing the corpse of the deceased baronet. This, at any rate,\nmay be spared to my readers. It was found to be necessary that the\ninterment should be made very quickly, as the body was already nearly\ndestroyed by alcohol. Having done all this, and sent back his horse\nto Greshamsbury, with directions that clothes for a journey might be\nsent to him, and a notice that he should not be home for some days,\nhe again returned to Lady Scatcherd.\n\nOf course he could not but think much of the immense property\nwhich was now, for a short time, altogether in his own hands. His\nresolution was soon made to go at once to London and consult the\nbest lawyer he could find--or the best dozen lawyers should such be\nnecessary--as to the validity of Mary's claims. This must be done\nbefore he said a word to her or to any of the Gresham family; but it\nmust be done instantly, so that all suspense might be at an end as\nsoon as possible. He must, of course, remain with Lady Scatcherd till\nthe funeral should be over; but when that office should be complete,\nhe would start instantly for London.\n\nIn resolving to tell no one as to Mary's fortune till after he had\nfortified himself with legal warranty, he made one exception. He\nthought it rational that he should explain to Lady Scatcherd who was\nnow the heir under her husband's will; and he was the more inclined\nto do so, from feeling that the news would probably be gratifying to\nher. With this view, he had once or twice endeavoured to induce her\nto talk about the property, but she had been unwilling to do so. She\nseemed to dislike all allusions to it, and it was not till she had\nincidentally mentioned the fact that she would have to look for a\nhome, that he was able to fix her to the subject. This was on the\nevening before the funeral; on the afternoon of which day he intended\nto proceed to London.\n\n\"It may probably be arranged that you may continue to live here,\"\nsaid the doctor.\n\n\"I don't wish it at all,\" said she, rather sharply. \"I don't wish to\nhave any arrangements made. I would not be indebted to any of them\nfor anything. Oh, dear! if money could make it all right, I should\nhave enough of that.\"\n\n\"Indebted to whom, Lady Scatcherd? Who do you think will be the owner\nof Boxall Hill?\"\n\n\"Indeed, then, Dr Thorne, I don't much care: unless it be yourself,\nit won't be any friend of mine, or any one I shall care to make a\nfriend of. It isn't so easy for an old woman like me to make new\nfriends.\"\n\n\"Well, it certainly won't belong to me.\"\n\n\"I wish it did, with all my heart. But even then, I would not live\nhere. I have had too many troubles here to wish to see more.\"\n\n\"That shall be just as you like, Lady Scatcherd; but you will\nbe surprised to hear that the place will--at least I think it\nwill--belong to a friend of yours: to one to whom you have been very\nkind.\"\n\n\"And who is he, doctor? Won't it go to some of those Americans? I am\nsure I never did anything kind to them; though, indeed, I did love\npoor Mary Scatcherd. But that's years upon years ago, and she is dead\nand gone now. Well, I begrudge nothing to Mary's children. As I have\nnone of my own, it is right they should have the money. It has not\nmade me happy; I hope it may do so to them.\"\n\n\"The property will, I think, go to Mary Scatcherd's eldest child. It\nis she whom you have known as Mary Thorne.\"\n\n\"Doctor!\" And then Lady Scatcherd, as she made the exclamation, put\nboth her hands down to hold her chair, as though she feared the\nweight of her surprise would topple her off her seat.\n\n\"Yes; Mary Thorne--my Mary--to whom you have been so good, who loves\nyou so well; she, I believe, will be Sir Roger's heiress. And it was\nso that Sir Roger intended on his deathbed, in the event of poor\nLouis's life being cut short. If this be so, will you be ashamed to\nstay here as the guest of Mary Thorne? She has not been ashamed to be\nyour guest.\"\n\nBut Lady Scatcherd was now too much interested in the general tenor\nof the news which she had heard to care much about the house which\nshe was to inhabit in future. Mary Thorne, the heiress of Boxall\nHill! Mary Thorne, the still living child of that poor creature who\nhad so nearly died when they were all afflicted with their early\ngrief! Well; there was consolation, there was comfort in this. There\nwere but three people left in the world that she could love: her\nfoster-child, Frank Gresham--Mary Thorne, and the doctor. If the\nmoney went to Mary, it would of course go to Frank, for she now knew\nthat they loved each other; and if it went to them, would not the\ndoctor have his share also; such share as he might want? Could she\nhave governed the matter, she would have given it all to Frank; and\nnow it would be as well bestowed.\n\nYes; there was consolation in this. They both sat up more than half\nthe night talking over it, and giving and receiving explanations. If\nonly the council of lawyers would not be adverse! That was now the\npoint of suspense.\n\nThe doctor, before he left her, bade her hold her peace, and say\nnothing of Mary's fortune to any one till her rights had been\nabsolutely acknowledged. \"It will be nothing not to have it,\" said\nthe doctor; \"but it would be very bad to hear it was hers, and then\nto lose it.\"\n\nOn the next morning, Dr Thorne deposited the remains of Sir Louis in\nthe vault prepared for the family in the parish church. He laid the\nson where a few months ago he had laid the father,--and so the title\nof Scatcherd became extinct. Their race of honour had not been long.\n\nAfter the funeral, the doctor hurried up to London, and there we will\nleave him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV\n\nSaturday Evening and Sunday Morning\n\n\nWe must now go back a little and describe how Frank had been sent off\non special business to London. The household at Greshamsbury was at\nthis time in but a doleful state. It seemed to be pervaded, from the\nsquire down to the scullery-maid, with a feeling that things were\nnot going well; and men and women, in spite of Beatrice's coming\nmarriage, were grim-visaged, and dolorous. Mr Mortimer Gazebee,\nrejected though he had been, still went and came, talking much to the\nsquire, much also to her ladyship, as to the ill-doings which were in\nthe course of projection by Sir Louis; and Frank went about the house\nwith clouded brow, as though finally resolved to neglect his one\ngreat duty.\n\nPoor Beatrice was robbed of half her joy: over and over again her\nbrother asked her whether she had yet seen Mary, and she was obliged\nas often to answer that she had not. Indeed, she did not dare to\nvisit her friend, for it was hardly possible that they should\nsympathise with each other. Mary was, to say the least, stubborn in\nher pride; and Beatrice, though she could forgive her friend for\nloving her brother, could not forgive the obstinacy with which Mary\npersisted in a course which, as Beatrice thought, she herself knew to\nbe wrong.\n\nAnd then Mr Gazebee came down from town, with an intimation that it\nbehoved the squire himself to go up that he might see certain learned\npundits, and be badgered in his own person at various dingy, dismal\nchambers in Lincoln's Inn Fields, the Temple, and Gray's Inn Lane. It\nwas an invitation exactly of that sort which a good many years ago\nwas given to a certain duck.\n\n\"Will you, will you--will you, will you--come and be killed?\"\nAlthough Mr Gazebee urged the matter with such eloquence, the squire\nremained steady to his objection, and swam obstinately about his\nGreshamsbury pond in any direction save that which seemed to lead\ntowards London.\n\nThis occurred on the very evening of that Friday which had witnessed\nthe Lady Arabella's last visit to Dr Thorne's house. The question of\nthe squire's necessary journey to the great fountains of justice was,\nof course, discussed between Lady Arabella and Mr Gazebee; and it\noccurred to the former, full as she was of Frank's iniquity and of\nMary's obstinacy, that if Frank were sent up in lieu of his father,\nit would separate them at least for a while. If she could only get\nFrank away without seeing his love, she might yet so work upon him,\nby means of the message which Mary had sent, as to postpone, if not\nbreak off, this hateful match. It was inconceivable that a youth\nof twenty-three, and such a youth as Frank, should be obstinately\nconstant to a girl possessed of no great beauty--so argued Lady\nArabella to herself--and who had neither wealth, birth, nor fashion\nto recommend her.\n\nAnd thus it was at last settled--the squire being a willing party\nto the agreement--that Frank should go up and be badgered in lieu\nof his father. At his age it was possible to make it appear a\nthing desirable, if not necessary--on account of the importance\nconveyed--to sit day after day in the chambers of Messrs Slow &\nBideawhile, and hear musty law talk, and finger dusty law parchments.\nThe squire had made many visits to Messrs Slow & Bideawhile, and he\nknew better. Frank had not hitherto been there on his own bottom, and\nthus he fell easily into the trap.\n\nMr Oriel was also going to London, and this was another reason for\nsending Frank. Mr Oriel had business of great importance, which it\nwas quite necessary that he should execute before his marriage. How\nmuch of this business consisted in going to his tailor, buying a\nwedding-ring, and purchasing some other more costly present for\nBeatrice, we need not here inquire. But Mr Oriel was quite on Lady\nArabella's side with reference to this mad engagement, and as Frank\nand he were now fast friends, some good might be done in that way.\n\"If we all caution him against it, he can hardly withstand us all!\"\nsaid Lady Arabella to herself.\n\nThe matter was broached to Frank on the Saturday evening, and settled\nbetween them all the same night. Nothing, of course, was at that\nmoment said about Mary; but Lady Arabella was too full of the subject\nto let him go to London without telling him that Mary was ready to\nrecede if only he would allow her to do so. About eleven o'clock,\nFrank was sitting in his own room, conning over the difficulties\nof the situation--thinking of his father's troubles, and his own\nposition--when he was roused from his reverie by a slight tap at the\ndoor.\n\n\"Come in,\" said he, somewhat loudly. He thought it was one of his\nsisters, who were apt to visit him at all hours and for all manner\nof reasons; and he, though he was usually gentle to them, was not at\npresent exactly in a humour to be disturbed.\n\nThe door gently opened, and he saw his mother standing hesitating in\nthe passage.\n\n\"Can I come in, Frank?\" said she.\n\n\"Oh, yes, mother; by all means:\" and then, with some surprise marked\nin his countenance, he prepared a seat for her. Such a visit as this\nfrom Lady Arabella was very unusual; so much so, that he had probably\nnot seen her in his own room since the day when he first left school.\nHe had nothing, however, to be ashamed of; nothing to conceal, unless\nit were an open letter from Miss Dunstable which he had in his hand\nwhen she entered, and which he somewhat hurriedly thrust into his\npocket.\n\n\"I wanted to say a few words to you, Frank, before you start for\nLondon about this business.\" Frank signified by a gesture, that he\nwas quite ready to listen to her.\n\n\"I am so glad to see your father putting the matter into your hands.\nYou are younger than he is; and then--I don't know why, but somehow\nyour father has never been a good man of business--everything has\ngone wrong with him.\"\n\n\"Oh, mother! do not say anything against him.\"\n\n\"No, Frank, I will not; I do not wish it. Things have been\nunfortunate, certainly. Ah me! I little thought when I married--but I\ndon't mean to complain--I have excellent children, and I ought to be\nthankful for that.\"\n\nFrank began to fear that no good could be coming when his mother\nspoke in that strain. \"I will do the best I can,\" said he, \"up in\ntown. I can't help thinking myself that Mr Gazebee might have done as\nwell, but--\"\n\n\"Oh, dear no; by no means. In such cases the principal must show\nhimself. Besides, it is right you should know how matters stand. Who\nis so much interested in it as you are? Poor Frank! I so often feel\nfor you when I think how the property has dwindled.\"\n\n\"Pray do not mind me, mother. Why should you talk of it as my matter\nwhile my father is not yet forty-five? His life, so to speak, is as\ngood as mine. I can do very well without it; all I want is to be\nallowed to settle to something.\"\n\n\"You mean a profession.\"\n\n\"Yes; something of that sort.\"\n\n\"They are so slow, dear Frank. You, who speak French so well--I\nshould think my brother might get you in as attach\u00c3\u00a9 to some embassy.\"\n\n\"That wouldn't suit me at all,\" said Frank.\n\n\"Well, we'll talk about that some other time. But I came about\nsomething else, and I do hope you will hear me.\"\n\nFrank's brow again grew black, for he knew that his mother was about\nto say something which it would be disagreeable for him to hear.\n\n\"I was with Mary, yesterday.\"\n\n\"Well, mother?\"\n\n\"Don't be angry with me, Frank; you can't but know that the fate\nof an only son must be a subject of anxiety to a mother.\" Ah! how\nsingularly altered was Lady Arabella's tone since first she had taken\nupon herself to discuss the marriage prospects of her son! Then how\nautocratic had she been as she sent him away, bidding him, with full\ncommand, to throw himself into the golden embraces of Miss Dunstable!\nBut now, how humble, as she came suppliantly to his room, craving\nthat she might have leave to whisper into his ears a mother's anxious\nfears! Frank had laughed at her stern behests, though he had half\nobeyed them; but he was touched to the heart by her humility.\n\nHe drew his chair nearer to her, and took her by the hand. But she,\ndisengaging hers, parted the hair from off his forehead, and kissed\nhis brow. \"Oh, Frank,\" she said, \"I have been so proud of you, am\nstill so proud of you. It will send me to my grave if I see you sink\nbelow your proper position. Not that it will be your fault. I am sure\nit will not be your fault. Only circumstanced as you are, you should\nbe doubly, trebly, careful. If your father had not--\"\n\n\"Do not speak against my father.\"\n\n\"No, Frank; I will not--no, I will not; not another word. And now,\nFrank--\"\n\nBefore we go on we must say one word further as to Lady Arabella's\ncharacter. It will probably be said that she was a consummate\nhypocrite; but at the present moment she was not hypocritical. She\ndid love her son; was anxious--very, very anxious for him; was proud\nof him, and almost admired the very obstinacy which so vexed her to\nher inmost soul. No grief would be to her so great as that of seeing\nhim sink below what she conceived to be his position. She was as\ngenuinely motherly, in wishing that he should marry money, as another\nwoman might be in wishing to see her son a bishop; or as the Spartan\nmatron, who preferred that her offspring should return on his shield,\nto hearing that he had come back whole in limb but tainted in honour.\nWhen Frank spoke of a profession, she instantly thought of what Lord\nde Courcy might do for him. If he would not marry money, he might, at\nany rate, be an attach\u00c3\u00a9 at an embassy. A profession--hard work, as\na doctor, or as an engineer--would, according to her ideas, degrade\nhim; cause him to sink below his proper position; but to dangle at\na foreign court, to make small talk at the evening parties of a\nlady ambassadress, and occasionally, perhaps, to write demi-official\nnotes containing demi-official tittle-tattle; this would be in proper\naccordance with the high honour of a Gresham of Greshamsbury.\n\nWe may not admire the direction taken by Lady Arabella's energy on\nbehalf of her son, but that energy was not hypocritical.\n\n\"And now, Frank--\" She looked wistfully into his face as she\naddressed him, as though half afraid to go on, and begging that he\nwould receive with complaisance whatever she found herself forced to\nsay.\n\n\"Well, mother?\"\n\n\"I was with Mary, yesterday.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes; what then? I know what your feelings are with regard to\nher.\"\n\n\"No, Frank; you wrong me. I have no feelings against her--none,\nindeed; none but this: that she is not fit to be your wife.\"\n\n\"I think her fit.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes; but how fit? Think of your position, Frank, and what means\nyou have of keeping her. Think what you are. Your father's only son;\nthe heir to Greshamsbury. If Greshamsbury be ever again more than a\nname, it is you that must redeem it. Of all men living you are the\nleast able to marry a girl like Mary Thorne.\"\n\n\"Mother, I will not sell myself for what you call my position.\"\n\n\"Who asks you? I do not ask you; nobody asks you. I do not want you\nto marry any one. I did think once--but let that pass. You are now\ntwenty-three. In ten years' time you will still be a young man. I\nonly ask you to wait. If you marry now, that is, marry such a girl as\nMary Thorne--\"\n\n\"Such a girl! Where shall I find such another?\"\n\n\"I mean as regards money, Frank; you know I mean that; how are you to\nlive? Where are you to go? And then, her birth. Oh, Frank, Frank!\"\n\n\"Birth! I hate such pretence. What was--but I won't talk about it.\nMother, I tell you my word is pledged, and on no account will I be\ninduced to break it.\"\n\n\"Ah, that's just it; that's just the point. Now, Frank, listen to me.\nPray listen to me patiently for one minute. I do not ask much of\nyou.\"\n\nFrank promised that he would listen patiently; but he looked anything\nbut patient as he said so.\n\n\"I have seen Mary, as it was certainly my duty to do. You cannot be\nangry with me for that.\"\n\n\"Who said that I was angry, mother?\"\n\n\"Well, I have seen her, and I must own, that though she was not\ndisposed to be courteous to me, personally, she said much that marked\nher excellent good sense. But the gist of it was this; that as she\nhad made you a promise, nothing should turn her from that promise but\nyour permission.\"\n\n\"And do you think--\"\n\n\"Wait a moment, Frank, and listen to me. She confessed that this\nmarriage was one which would necessarily bring distress on all your\nfamily; that it was one which would probably be ruinous to yourself;\nthat it was a match which could not be approved of: she did, indeed;\nshe confessed all that. 'I have nothing', she said--those were her\nown words--'I have nothing to say in favour of this engagement,\nexcept that he wishes it.' That is what she thinks of it herself.\n'His wishes are not a reason; but a law,' she said--\"\n\n\"And, mother, would you have me desert such a girl as that?\"\n\n\"It is not deserting, Frank: it would not be deserting: you would be\ndoing that which she herself approves of. She feels the impropriety\nof going on; but she cannot draw back because of her promise to you.\nShe thinks that she cannot do it, even though she wishes it.\"\n\n\"Wishes it! Oh, mother!\"\n\n\"I do believe she does, because she has sense to feel the truth of\nall that your friends say. Oh, Frank, I will go on my knees to you if\nyou will listen to me.\"\n\n\"Oh, mother! mother! mother!\"\n\n\"You should think twice, Frank, before you refuse the only request\nyour mother ever made you. And why do I ask you? why do I come to you\nthus? Is it for my own sake? Oh, my boy! my darling boy! will you\nlose everything in life, because you love the child with whom you\nhave played as a child?\"\n\n\"Whose fault is it that we were together as children? She is now more\nthan a child. I look on her already as my wife.\"\n\n\"But she is not your wife, Frank; and she knows that she ought not to\nbe. It is only because you hold her to it that she consents to be\nso.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say that she does not love me?\"\n\nLady Arabella would probably have said this, also, had she dared;\nbut she felt, that in doing so, she would be going too far. It was\nuseless for her to say anything that would be utterly contradicted by\nan appeal to Mary herself.\n\n\"No, Frank; I do not mean to say that you do not love her. What\nI do mean is this: that it is not becoming in you to give up\neverything--not only yourself, but all your family--for such a love\nas this; and that she, Mary herself, acknowledges this. Every one is\nof the same opinion. Ask your father: I need not say that he would\nagree with you about everything if he could. I will not say the de\nCourcys.\"\n\n\"Oh, the de Courcys!\"\n\n\"Yes, they are my relations; I know that.\" Lady Arabella could not\nquite drop the tone of bitterness which was natural to her in saying\nthis. \"But ask your sisters; ask Mr Oriel, whom you esteem so much;\nask your friend Harry Baker.\"\n\nFrank sat silent for a moment or two while his mother, with a look\nalmost of agony, gazed into his face. \"I will ask no one,\" at last he\nsaid.\n\n\"Oh, my boy! my boy!\"\n\n\"No one but myself can know my own heart.\"\n\n\"And you will sacrifice all to such a love as that, all; her, also,\nwhom you say that you so love? What happiness can you give her as\nyour wife? Oh, Frank! is that the only answer you will make your\nmother on her knees?\n\n\"Oh, mother! mother!\"\n\n\"No, Frank, I will not let you ruin yourself; I will not let you\ndestroy yourself. Promise this, at least, that you will think of what\nI have said.\"\n\n\"Think of it! I do think of it.\"\n\n\"Ah, but think of it in earnest. You will be absent now in London;\nyou will have the business of the estate to manage; you will have\nheavy cares upon your hands. Think of it as a man, and not as a boy.\"\n\n\"I will see her to-morrow before I go.\"\n\n\"No, Frank, no; grant me that trifle, at any rate. Think upon this\nwithout seeing her. Do not proclaim yourself so weak that you cannot\ntrust yourself to think over what your mother says to you without\nasking her leave. Though you be in love, do not be childish with it.\nWhat I have told you as coming from her is true, word for word; if it\nwere not, you would soon learn so. Think now of what I have said, and\nof what she says, and when you come back from London, then you can\ndecide.\"\n\nTo so much Frank consented after some further parley; namely, that he\nwould proceed to London on the following Monday morning without again\nseeing Mary. And in the meantime, she was waiting with sore heart for\nhis answer to that letter that was lying, and was still to lie for so\nmany hours, in the safe protection of the Silverbridge postmistress.\n\nIt may seem strange; but, in truth, his mother's eloquence had more\neffect on Frank than that of his father: and yet, with his father he\nhad always sympathised. But his mother had been energetic; whereas,\nhis father, if not lukewarm, had, at any rate, been timid. \"I will\nask no one,\" Frank had said in the strong determination of his heart;\nand yet the words were hardly out of his mouth before he bethought\nhimself that he would talk the thing over with Harry Baker. \"Not,\"\nsaid he to himself, \"that I have any doubt; I have no doubt; but I\nhate to have all the world against me. My mother wishes me to ask\nHarry Baker. Harry is a good fellow, and I will ask him.\" And with\nthis resolve he betook himself to bed.\n\nThe following day was Sunday. After breakfast Frank went with the\nfamily to church, as was usual; and there, as usual, he saw Mary in\nDr Thorne's pew. She, as she looked at him, could not but wonder why\nhe had not answered the letter which was still at Silverbridge; and\nhe endeavoured to read in her face whether it was true, as his mother\nhad told him, that she was quite ready to give him up. The prayers of\nboth of them were disturbed, as is so often the case with the prayers\nof other anxious people.\n\nThere was a separate door opening from the Greshamsbury pew out into\nthe Greshamsbury grounds, so that the family were not forced into\nunseemly community with the village multitude in going to and from\ntheir prayers; for the front door of the church led out into a road\nwhich had no connexion with the private path. It was not unusual with\nFrank and his father to go round, after the service, to the chief\nentrance, so that they might speak to their neighbours, and get rid\nof some of the exclusiveness which was intended for them. On this\nmorning the squire did so; but Frank walked home with his mother and\nsisters, so that Mary saw no more of him.\n\nI have said that he walked home with his mother and his sisters;\nbut he rather followed in their path. He was not inclined to talk\nmuch, at least, not to them; and he continued asking himself the\nquestion--whether it could be possible that he was wrong in remaining\ntrue to his promise? Could it be that he owed more to his father and\nhis mother, and what they chose to call his position, than he did to\nMary?\n\nAfter church, Mr Gazebee tried to get hold of him, for there was much\nstill to be said, and many hints to be given, as to how Frank should\nspeak, and, more especially, as to how he should hold his tongue\namong the learned pundits in and about Chancery Lane. \"You must be\nvery wide awake with Messrs Slow & Bideawhile,\" said Mr Gazebee. But\nFrank would not hearken to him just at that moment. He was going to\nride over to Harry Baker, so he put Mr Gazebee off till the half-hour\nbefore dinner,--or else the half-hour after tea.\n\nOn the previous day he had received a letter from Miss Dunstable,\nwhich he had hitherto read but once. His mother had interrupted him\nas he was about to refer to it; and now, as his father's nag was\nbeing saddled--he was still prudent in saving the black horse--he\nagain took it out.\n\nMiss Dunstable had written in an excellent humour. She was in great\ndistress about the oil of Lebanon, she said. \"I have been trying to\nget a purchaser for the last two years; but my lawyer won't let me\nsell it, because the would-be purchasers offer a thousand pounds or\nso less than the value. I would give ten to be rid of the bore; but I\nam as little able to act myself as Sancho was in his government. The\noil of Lebanon! Did you hear anything of it when you were in those\nparts? I thought of changing the name to 'London particular;' but my\nlawyer says the brewers would bring an action against me.\n\n\"I was going down to your neighbourhood--to your friend the duke's,\nat least. But I am prevented by my poor doctor, who is so weak that\nI must take him to Malvern. It is a great bore; but I have the\nsatisfaction that I do my duty by him!\n\n\"Your cousin George is to be married at last. So I hear, at least.\nHe loves wisely, if not well; for his widow has the name of being\nprudent and fairly well to do in the world. She has got over the\ncaprices of her youth. Dear Aunt de Courcy will be so delighted. I\nmight perhaps have met her at Gatherum Castle. I do so regret it.\n\n\"Mr Moffat has turned up again. We all thought you had finally\nextinguished him. He left a card the other day, and I have told the\nservant always to say that I am at home, and that you are with me. He\nis going to stand for some borough in the west of Ireland. He's used\nto shillelaghs by this time.\n\n\"By the by, I have a _cadeau_ for a friend of yours. I won't tell you\nwhat it is, nor permit you to communicate the fact. But when you tell\nme that in sending it I may fairly congratulate her on having so\ndevoted a slave as you, it shall be sent.\n\n\"If you have nothing better to do at present, do come and see my\ninvalid at Malvern. Perhaps you might have a mind to treat for the\noil of Lebanon. I'll give you all the assistance I can in cheating my\nlawyers.\"\n\nThere was not much about Mary in this; but still, the little that was\nsaid made him again declare that neither father nor mother should\nmove him from his resolution. \"I will write to her and say that she\nmay send her present when she pleases. Or I will run down to Malvern\nfor a day. It will do me good to see her.\" And so resolved, he rode\naway to Mill Hill, thinking, as he went, how he would put the matter\nto Harry Baker.\n\nHarry was at home; but we need not describe the whole interview. Had\nFrank been asked beforehand, he would have declared, that on no\npossible subject could he have had the slightest hesitation in asking\nHarry any question, or communicating to him any tidings. But when the\ntime came, he found that he did hesitate much. He did not want to ask\nhis friend if he should be wise to marry Mary Thorne. Wise or not, he\nwas determined to do that. But he wished to be quite sure that his\nmother was wrong in saying that all the world would dissuade him from\nit. Miss Dunstable, at any rate, did not do so.\n\nAt last, seated on a stile at the back of the Mill Hill stables,\nwhile Harry stood close before him with both his hands in his\npockets, he did get his story told. It was by no means the first\ntime that Harry Baker had heard about Mary Thorne, and he was not,\ntherefore, so surprised as he might have been, had the affair\nbeen new to him. And thus, standing there in the position we have\ndescribed, did Mr Baker, junior, give utterance to such wisdom as was\nin him on this subject.\n\n\"You see, Frank, there are two sides to every question; and, as I\ntake it, fellows are so apt to go wrong because they are so fond of\none side, they won't look at the other. There's no doubt about it,\nLady Arabella is a very clever woman, and knows what's what; and\nthere's no doubt about this either, that you have a very ticklish\nhand of cards to play.\"\n\n\"I'll play it straightforward; that's my game\" said Frank.\n\n\"Well and good, my dear fellow. That's the best game always. But what\nis straightforward? Between you and me, I fear there's no doubt that\nyour father's property has got into a deuce of a mess.\"\n\n\"I don't see that that has anything to do with it.\"\n\n\"Yes, but it has. If the estate was all right, and your father could\ngive you a thousand a year to live on without feeling it, and if your\neldest child would be cock-sure of Greshamsbury, it might be very\nwell that you should please yourself as to marrying at once. But\nthat's not the case; and yet Greshamsbury is too good a card to be\nflung away.\"\n\n\"I could fling it away to-morrow,\" said Frank.\n\n\"Ah! you think so,\" said Harry the Wise. \"But if you were to hear\nto-morrow that Sir Louis Scatcherd were master of the whole place,\nand be d---- to him, you would feel very uncomfortable.\" Had Harry\nknown how near Sir Louis was to his last struggle, he would not have\nspoken of him in this manner. \"That's all very fine talk, but it\nwon't bear wear and tear. You do care for Greshamsbury if you are the\nfellow I take you to be: care for it very much; and you care too for\nyour father being Gresham of Greshamsbury.\"\n\n\"This won't affect my father at all.\"\n\n\"Ah, but it will affect him very much. If you were to marry Miss\nThorne to-morrow, there would at once be an end to any hope of your\nsaving the property.\"\n\n\"And do you mean to say I'm to be a liar to her for such reasons as\nthat? Why, Harry, I should be as bad as Moffat. Only it would be ten\ntimes more cowardly, as she has no brother.\"\n\n\"I must differ from you there altogether; but mind, I don't mean to\nsay anything. Tell me that you have made up your mind to marry her,\nand I'll stick to you through thick and thin. But if you ask my\nadvice, why, I must give it. It is quite a different affair to that\nof Moffat's. He had lots of tin, everything he could want, and there\ncould be no reason why he should not marry,--except that he was a\nsnob, of whom your sister was well quit. But this is very different.\nIf I, as your friend, were to put it to Miss Thorne, what do you\nthink she would say herself?\"\n\n\"She would say whatever she thought best for me.\"\n\n\"Exactly: because she is a trump. And I say the same. There can be no\ndoubt about it, Frank, my boy: such a marriage would be very foolish\nfor you both; very foolish. Nobody can admire Miss Thorne more than\nI do; but you oughtn't to be a marrying man for the next ten years,\nunless you get a fortune. If you tell her the truth, and if she's the\ngirl I take her to be, she'll not accuse you of being false. She'll\npeak for a while; and so will you, old chap. But others have had to\ndo that before you. They have got over it, and so will you.\"\n\nSuch was the spoken wisdom of Harry Baker, and who can say that he\nwas wrong? Frank sat a while on his rustle seat, paring his nails\nwith his penknife, and then looking up, he thus thanked his friend:--\n\n\"I'm sure you mean well, Harry; and I'm much obliged to you. I dare\nsay you're right too. But, somehow, it doesn't come home to me. And\nwhat is more, after what has passed, I could not tell her that I wish\nto part from her. I could not do it. And besides, I have that sort of\nfeeling, that if I heard she was to marry any one else, I am sure I\nshould blow his brains out. Either his or my own.\"\n\n\"Well, Frank, you may count on me for anything, except the last\nproposition:\" and so they shook hands, and Frank rode back to\nGreshamsbury.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLV\n\nLaw Business in London\n\n\nOn the Monday morning at six o'clock, Mr Oriel and Frank started\ntogether; but early as it was, Beatrice was up to give them a cup of\ncoffee, Mr Oriel having slept that night in the house. Whether Frank\nwould have received his coffee from his sister's fair hands had not\nMr Oriel been there, may be doubted. He, however, loudly asserted\nthat he should not have done so, when she laid claim to great merit\nfor rising in his behalf.\n\nMr Oriel had been specially instigated by Lady Arabella to use the\nopportunity of their joint journey, for pointing out to Frank the\niniquity as well as madness of the course he was pursuing; and he had\npromised to obey her ladyship's behests. But Mr Oriel was perhaps not\nan enterprising man, and was certainly not a presumptuous one. He did\nintend to do as he was bid; but when he began, with the object of\nleading up to the subject of Frank's engagement, he always softened\ndown into some much easier enthusiasm in the matter of his own\nengagement with Beatrice. He had not that perspicuous, but not\nover-sensitive strength of mind which had enabled Harry Baker to\nexpress his opinion out at once; and boldly as he did it, yet to do\nso without offence.\n\nFour times before the train arrived in London, he made some little\nattempt; but four times he failed. As the subject was matrimony, it\nwas his easiest course to begin about himself; but he never could get\nany further.\n\n\"No man was ever more fortunate in a wife than I shall be,\" he said,\nwith a soft, euphuistic self-complacency, which would have been silly\nhad it been adopted to any other person than the bride's brother. His\nintention, however, was very good, for he meant to show, that in his\ncase marriage was prudent and wise, because his case differed so\nwidely from that of Frank.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Frank. \"She is an excellent good girl:\" he had said it\nthree times before, and was not very energetic.\n\n\"Yes, and so exactly suited to me; indeed, all that I could have\ndreamed of. How very well she looked this morning! Some girls only\nlook well at night. I should not like that at all.\"\n\n\"You mustn't expect her to look like that always at six o'clock\na.m.,\" said Frank, laughing. \"Young ladies only take that trouble on\nvery particular occasions. She wouldn't have come down like that if\nmy father or I had been going alone. No, and she won't do so for you\nin a couple of years' time.\"\n\n\"Oh, but she's always nice. I have seen her at home as much almost as\nyou could do; and then she's so sincerely religious.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, of course; that is, I am sure she is,\" said Frank, looking\nsolemn as became him.\n\n\"She's made to be a clergyman's wife.\"\n\n\"Well, so it seems,\" said Frank.\n\n\"A married life is, I'm sure, the happiest in the world--if people\nare only in a position to marry,\" said Mr Oriel, gradually drawing\nnear to the accomplishment of his design.\n\n\"Yes; quite so. Do you know, Oriel, I never was so sleepy in my life.\nWhat with all that fuss of Gazebee's, and one thing and another, I\ncould not get to bed till one o'clock; and then I couldn't sleep.\nI'll take a snooze now, if you won't think it uncivil.\" And then,\nputting his feet upon the opposite seat, he settled himself\ncomfortably to his rest. And so Mr Oriel's last attempt for lecturing\nFrank in the railway-carriage faded away and was annihilated.\n\nBy twelve o'clock Frank was with Messrs Slow & Bideawhile. Mr\nBideawhile was engaged at the moment, but he found the managing\nChancery clerk to be a very chatty gentleman. Judging from what he\nsaw, he would have said that the work to be done at Messrs Slow &\nBideawhile's was not very heavy.\n\n\"A singular man that Sir Louis,\" said the Chancery clerk.\n\n\"Yes; very singular,\" said Frank.\n\n\"Excellent security, excellent; no better; and yet he will foreclose;\nbut you see he has no power himself. But the question is, can the\ntrustee refuse? Then, again, trustees are so circumscribed nowadays\nthat they are afraid to do anything. There has been so much said\nlately, Mr Gresham, that a man doesn't know where he is, or what he\nis doing. Nobody trusts anybody. There have been such terrible things\nthat we can't wonder at it. Only think of the case of those Hills!\nHow can any one expect that any one else will ever trust a lawyer\nagain after that? But that's Mr Bideawhile's bell. How can any one\nexpect it? He will see you now, I dare say, Mr Gresham.\"\n\nSo it turned out, and Frank was ushered into the presence of Mr\nBideawhile. He had got his lesson by heart, and was going to rush\ninto the middle of his subject; such a course, however, was not in\naccordance with Mr Bideawhile's usual practice. Mr Bideawhile got up\nfrom his large wooden-seated Windsor chair, and, with a soft smile,\nin which, however, was mingled some slight dash of the attorney's\nacuteness, put out his hand to his young client; not, indeed, as\nthough he were going to shake hands with him, but as though the hand\nwere some ripe fruit all but falling, which his visitor might take\nand pluck if he thought proper. Frank took hold of the hand, which\nreturned him no pressure, and then let it go again, not making any\nattempt to gather the fruit.\n\n\"I have come up to town, Mr Bideawhile, about this mortgage,\"\ncommenced Frank.\n\n\"Mortgage--ah, sit down, Mr Gresham; sit down. I hope your father is\nquite well?\"\n\n\"Quite well, thank you.\"\n\n\"I have a great regard for your father. So I had for your\ngrandfather; a very good man indeed. You, perhaps, don't remember\nhim, Mr Gresham?\"\n\n\"He died when I was only a year old.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; no, you of course, can't remember him; but I do, well: he\nused to be very fond of some port wine I had. I think it was '11;'\nand if I don't mistake, I have a bottle or two of it yet; but it is\nnot worth drinking now. Port wine, you know, won't keep beyond a\ncertain time. That was very good wine. I don't exactly remember what\nit stood me a dozen then; but such wine can't be had now. As for the\nMadeira, you know there's an end of that. Do you drink Madeira, Mr\nGresham?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Frank, \"not very often.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry for that, for it's a fine wine; but then there's none\nof it left, you know. I have a few dozen, I'm told they're growing\npumpkins where the vineyards were. I wonder what they do with all the\npumpkins they grow in Switzerland! You've been in Switzerland, Mr\nGresham?\"\n\nFrank said he had been in Switzerland.\n\n\"It's a beautiful country; my girls made me go there last year. They\nsaid it would do me good; but then you know, they wanted to see it\nthemselves; ha! ha! ha! However, I believe I shall go again this\nautumn. That is to Aix, or some of those places; just for three\nweeks. I can't spare any more time, Mr Gresham. Do you like that\ndining at the _tables d'h\u00c3\u00b4te_?\"\n\n\"Pretty well, sometimes.\"\n\n\"One would get tired of it--eh! But they gave us capital dinners at\nZurich. I don't think much of their soup. But they had fish, and\nabout seven kinds of meats and poultry, and three or four puddings,\nand things of that sort. Upon my word, I thought we did very well,\nand so did my girls, too. You see a great many ladies travelling\nnow.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Frank; \"a great many.\"\n\n\"Upon my word, I think they are right; that is, if they can afford\ntime. I can't afford time. I'm here every day till five, Mr Gresham;\nthen I go out and dine in Fleet Street, and then back to work till\nnine.\"\n\n\"Dear me! that's very hard.\"\n\n\"Well, yes it is hard work. My boys don't like it; but I manage it\nsomehow. I get down to my little place in the country on Saturday. I\nshall be most happy to see you there next Saturday.\"\n\nFrank, thinking it would be outrageous on his part to take up much of\nthe time of the gentleman who was constrained to work so unreasonably\nhard, began again to talk about his mortgages, and, in so doing, had\nto mention the name of Mr Yates Umbleby.\n\n\"Ah, poor Umbleby!\" said Mr Bideawhile; \"what is he doing now? I am\nquite sure your father was right, or he wouldn't have done it; but I\nused to think that Umbleby was a decent sort of man enough. Not so\ngrand, you know, as your Gazebees and Gumptions--eh, Mr Gresham? They\ndo say young Gazebee is thinking of getting into Parliament. Let me\nsee: Umbleby married--who was it he married? That was the way your\nfather got hold of him; not your father, but your grandfather. I\nused to know all about it. Well, I was sorry for Umbleby. He has got\nsomething, I suppose--eh?\"\n\nFrank said that he believed Mr Yates Umbleby had something wherewith\nto keep the wolf from the door.\n\n\"So you have got Gazebee down there now? Gumption, Gazebee & Gazebee:\nvery good people, I'm sure; only, perhaps, they have a little too\nmuch on hand to do your father justice.\"\n\n\"But about Sir Louis, Mr Bideawhile.\"\n\n\"Well, about Sir Louis; a very bad sort of fellow, isn't he?\nDrinks--eh? I knew his father a little. He was a rough diamond, too.\nI was once down in Northamptonshire, about some railway business; let\nme see; I almost forget whether I was with him, or against him. But I\nknow he made sixty thousand pounds by one hour's work; sixty thousand\npounds! And then he got so mad with drinking that we all thought--\"\n\nAnd so Mr Bideawhile went on for two hours, and Frank found no\nopportunity of saying one word about the business which had brought\nhim up to town. What wonder that such a man as this should be obliged\nto stay at his office every night till nine o'clock?\n\nDuring these two hours, a clerk had come in three or four times,\nwhispering something to the lawyer, who, on the last of such\noccasions, turned to Frank, saying, \"Well, perhaps that will do for\nto-day. If you'll manage to call to-morrow, say about two, I will\nhave the whole thing looked up; or, perhaps Wednesday or Thursday\nwould suit you better.\" Frank, declaring that the morrow would suit\nhim very well, took his departure, wondering much at the manner in\nwhich business was done at the house of Messrs Slow & Bideawhile.\n\nWhen he called the next day, the office seemed to be rather\ndisturbed, and he was shown quickly into Mr Bideawhile's room. \"Have\nyou heard this?\" said that gentleman, putting a telegram into his\nhands. It contained tidings of the death of Sir Louis Scatcherd.\nFrank immediately knew that these tidings must be of importance to\nhis father; but he had no idea how vitally they concerned his own\nmore immediate interests.\n\n\"Dr Thorne will be up in town on Thursday evening after the funeral,\"\nsaid the talkative clerk. \"And nothing of course can be done till he\ncomes,\" said Mr Bideawhile. And so Frank, pondering on the mutability\nof human affairs, again took his departure.\n\nHe could do nothing now but wait for Dr Thorne's arrival, and so\nhe amused himself in the interval by running down to Malvern, and\ntreating with Miss Dunstable in person for the oil of Lebanon. He\nwent down on the Wednesday, and thus, failed to receive, on the\nThursday morning, Mary's letter, which reached London on that day.\nHe returned, however, on the Friday, and then got it; and perhaps\nit was well for Mary's happiness that he had seen Miss Dunstable in\nthe interval. \"I don't care what your mother says,\" said she, with\nemphasis. \"I don't care for any Harry, whether it be Harry Baker, or\nold Harry himself. You made her a promise, and you are bound to keep\nit; if not on one day, then on another. What! because you cannot draw\nback yourself, get out of it by inducing her to do so! Aunt de Courcy\nherself could not improve upon that.\" Fortified in this manner, he\nreturned to town on the Friday morning, and then got Mary's letter.\nFrank also got a note from Dr Thorne, stating that he had taken up\nhis temporary domicile at the Gray's Inn Coffee-house, so as to be\nnear the lawyers.\n\nIt has been suggested that the modern English writers of fiction\nshould among them keep a barrister, in order that they may be set\nright on such legal points as will arise in their little narratives,\nand thus avoid that exposure of their own ignorance of the laws,\nwhich, now, alas! they too often make. The idea is worthy of\nconsideration, and I can only say, that if such an arrangement can be\nmade, and if a counsellor adequately skilful can be found to accept\nthe office, I shall be happy to subscribe my quota; it would be but a\nmodest tribute towards the cost.\n\nBut as the suggestion has not yet been carried out, and as there is\nat present no learned gentleman whose duty would induce him to set\nme right, I can only plead for mercy if I be wrong allotting all Sir\nRoger's vast possessions in perpetuity to Miss Thorne, alleging also,\nin excuse, that the course of my narrative absolutely demands that\nshe shall be ultimately recognised as Sir Roger's undoubted heiress.\n\nSuch, after a not immoderate delay, was the opinion expressed to Dr\nThorne by his law advisers; and such, in fact, turned out to be the\ncase. I will leave the matter so, hoping that my very absence of\ndefence may serve to protect me from severe attack. If under such\na will as that described as having been made by Sir Roger, Mary\nwould not have been the heiress, that will must have been described\nwrongly.\n\nBut it was not quite at once that those tidings made themselves\nabsolutely certain to Dr Thorne's mind; nor was he able to express\nany such opinion when he first met Frank in London. At that time\nMary's letter was in Frank's pocket; and Frank, though his real\nbusiness appertained much more to the fact of Sir Louis's death, and\nthe effect that would immediately have on his father's affairs, was\nmuch more full of what so much more nearly concerned himself. \"I will\nshow it Dr Thorne himself,\" said he, \"and ask him what he thinks.\"\n\nDr Thorne was stretched fast asleep on the comfortless horse-hair\nsofa in the dingy sitting-room at the Gray's Inn Coffee-house when\nFrank found him. The funeral, and his journey to London, and the\nlawyers had together conquered his energies, and he lay and snored,\nwith nose upright, while heavy London summer flies settled on his\nhead and face, and robbed his slumbers of half their charms.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said he, jumping up as though he had been\ndetected in some disgraceful act. \"Upon my word, Frank, I beg your\npardon; but--well, my dear fellow, all well at Greshamsbury--eh?\" and\nas he shook himself, he made a lunge at one uncommonly disagreeable\nfly that had been at him for the last ten minutes. It is hardly\nnecessary to say that he missed his enemy.\n\n\"I should have been with you before, doctor, but I was down at\nMalvern.\"\n\n\"At Malvern, eh? Ah! so Oriel told me. The death of poor Sir Louis\nwas very sudden--was it not?\"\n\n\"Very.\"\n\n\"Poor fellow--poor fellow! His fate has for some time been past\nhope. It is a madness, Frank; the worst of madness. Only think of\nit--father and son! And such a career as the father had--such a\ncareer as the son might have had!\"\n\n\"It has been very quickly run,\" said Frank.\n\n\"May it be all forgiven him! I sometimes cannot but believe in a\nspecial Providence. That poor fellow was not able, never would have\nbeen able, to make proper use of the means which fortune had given\nhim. I hope they may fall into better hands. There is no use in\ndenying it, his death will be an immense relief to me, and a relief\nalso to your father. All this law business will now, of course, be\nstopped. As for me, I hope I may never be a trustee again.\"\n\nFrank had put his hand four or five times into his breast-pocket, and\nhad as often taken out and put back again Mary's letter before he\ncould find himself able to bring Dr Thorne to the subject. At last\nthere was a lull in the purely legal discussion, caused by the doctor\nintimating that he supposed Frank would now soon return to\nGreshamsbury.\n\n\"Yes; I shall go to-morrow morning.\"\n\n\"What! so soon as that? I counted on having you one day in London\nwith me.\"\n\n\"No, I shall go to-morrow. I'm not fit for company for any one. Nor\nam I fit for anything. Read that, doctor. It's no use putting it off\nany longer. I must get you to talk this over with me. Just read that,\nand tell me what you think about it. It was written a week ago, when\nI was there, but somehow I have only got it to-day.\" And putting the\nletter into the doctor's hands, he turned away to the window, and\nlooked out among the Holborn omnibuses. Dr Thorne took the letter and\nread it. Mary, after she had written it, had bewailed to herself that\nthe letter was cold; but it had not seemed cold to her lover, nor did\nit appear so to her uncle. When Frank turned round from the window,\nthe doctor's handkerchief was up to his eyes; who, in order to hide\nthe tears that were there, was obliged to go through a rather violent\nprocess of blowing his nose.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, as he gave back the letter to Frank.\n\nWell! what did well mean? Was it well? or would it be well were he,\nFrank, to comply with the suggestion made to him by Mary?\n\n\"It is impossible,\" he said, \"that matters should go on like that.\nThink what her sufferings must have been before she wrote that. I am\nsure she loves me.\"\n\n\"I think she does,\" said the doctor.\n\n\"And it is out of the question that she should be sacrificed; nor\nwill I consent to sacrifice my own happiness. I am quite willing to\nwork for my bread, and I am sure that I am able. I will not submit\nto-- Doctor, what answer do you think I ought to give to that\nletter? There can be no person so anxious for her happiness as you\nare--except myself.\" And as he asked the question, he again put into\nthe doctor's hand, almost unconsciously, the letter which he had\nstill been holding in his own.\n\nThe doctor turned it over and over, and then opened it again.\n\n\"What answer ought I to make to it?\" demanded Frank, with energy.\n\n\"You see, Frank, I have never interfered in this matter, otherwise\nthan to tell you the whole truth about Mary's birth.\"\n\n\"Oh, but you must interfere: you should say what you think.\"\n\n\"Circumstanced as you are now--that is, just at the present\nmoment--you could hardly marry immediately.\"\n\n\"Why not let me take a farm? My father could, at any rate, manage a\ncouple of thousand pounds or so for me to stock it. That would not\nbe asking much. If he could not give it me, I would not scruple\nto borrow so much elsewhere.\" And Frank bethought him of all Miss\nDunstable's offers.\n\n\"Oh, yes; that could be managed.\"\n\n\"Then why not marry immediately; say in six months or so? I am not\nunreasonable; though, Heaven knows, I have been kept in suspense long\nenough. As for her, I am sure she must be suffering frightfully. You\nknow her best, and, therefore, I ask you what answer I ought to make:\nas for myself, I have made up my own mind; I am not a child, nor will\nI let them treat me as such.\"\n\nFrank, as he spoke, was walking rapidly about the room; and he\nbrought out his different positions, one after the other, with a\nlittle pause, while waiting for the doctor's answer. The doctor was\nsitting, with the letter still in his hands, on the head of the sofa,\nturning over in his mind the apparent absurdity of Frank's desire to\nborrow two thousand pounds for a farm, when, in all human\nprobability, he might in a few months be in possession of almost any\nsum he should choose to name. And yet he would not tell him of Sir\nRoger's will. \"If it should turn out to be all wrong?\" said he to\nhimself.\n\n\"Do you wish me to give her up?\" said Frank, at last.\n\n\"No. How can I wish it? How can I expect a better match for her?\nBesides, Frank, I love no man in the world so well as I do you.\"\n\n\"Then you will help me?\"\n\n\"What! against your father?\"\n\n\"Against! no, not against anybody. But will you tell Mary that she\nhas your consent?\"\n\n\"I think she knows that.\"\n\n\"But you have never said anything to her.\"\n\n\"Look here, Frank; you ask me for my advice, and I will give it you:\ngo home; though, indeed, I would rather you went anywhere else.\"\n\n\"No, I must go home; and I must see her.\"\n\n\"Very well, go home: as for seeing Mary, I think you had better put\nit off for a fortnight.\"\n\n\"Quite impossible.\"\n\n\"Well, that's my advice. But, at any rate, make up your mind to\nnothing for a fortnight. Wait for one fortnight, and I then will tell\nyou plainly--you and her too--what I think you ought to do. At the\nend of a fortnight come to me, and tell the squire that I will take\nit as a great kindness if he will come with you. She has suffered,\nterribly, terribly; and it is necessary that something should be\nsettled. But a fortnight more can make no great difference.\"\n\n\"And the letter?\"\n\n\"Oh! there's the letter.\"\n\n\"But what shall I say? Of course I shall write to-night.\"\n\n\"Tell her to wait a fortnight. And, Frank, mind you bring your father\nwith you.\"\n\nFrank could draw nothing further from his friend save constant\nrepetitions of this charge to him to wait a fortnight,--just one\nother fortnight.\n\n\"Well, I will come to you at any rate,\" said Frank; \"and, if\npossible, I will bring my father. But I shall write to Mary\nto-night.\"\n\nOn the Saturday morning, Mary, who was then nearly broken-hearted at\nher lover's silence, received a short note:--\n\n\n   MY OWN MARY,\n\n   I shall be home to-morrow. I will by no means release you\n   from your promise. Of course you will perceive that I only\n   got your letter to-day.\n\n   Your own dearest,\n\n   FRANK.\n\n   P.S.--You will have to call me so hundreds and hundreds of\n   times yet.\n\n\nShort as it was, this sufficed Mary. It is one thing for a young lady\nto make prudent, heart-breaking suggestions, but quite another to\nhave them accepted. She did call him dearest Frank, even on that one\nday, almost as often as he had desired her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVI\n\nOur Pet Fox Finds a Tail\n\n\nFrank returned home, and his immediate business was of course with\nhis father, and with Mr Gazebee, who was still at Greshamsbury.\n\n\"But who is the heir?\" asked Mr Gazebee, when Frank had explained\nthat the death of Sir Louis rendered unnecessary any immediate legal\nsteps.\n\n\"Upon my word I don't know,\" said Frank.\n\n\"You saw Dr Thorne,\" said the squire. \"He must have known.\"\n\n\"I never thought of asking him,\" said Frank, na\u00c3\u00afvely.\n\nMr Gazebee looked rather solemn. \"I wonder at that,\" said he; \"for\neverything now depends on the hands the property will go into. Let\nme see; I think Sir Roger had a married sister. Was not that so, Mr\nGresham?\" And then it occurred for the first time, both to the squire\nand to his son, that Mary Thorne was the eldest child of this sister.\nBut it never occurred to either of them that Mary could be the\nbaronet's heir.\n\nDr Thorne came down for a couple of days before the fortnight was\nover to see his patients, and then returned again to London. But\nduring this short visit he was utterly dumb on the subject of the\nheir. He called at Greshamsbury to see Lady Arabella, and was even\nquestioned by the squire on the subject. But he obstinately refused\nto say more than that nothing certain could be known for yet a few\ndays.\n\nImmediately after his return, Frank saw Mary, and told her all that\nhad happened. \"I cannot understand my uncle,\" said she, almost\ntrembling as she stood close to him in her own drawing-room. \"He\nusually hates mysteries, and yet now he is so mysterious. He told me,\nFrank--that was after I had written that unfortunate letter--\"\n\n\"Unfortunate, indeed! I wonder what you really thought of me when you\nwere writing it?\"\n\n\"If you had heard what your mother said, you would not be surprised.\nBut, after that, uncle said--\"\n\n\"Said what?\"\n\n\"He seemed to think--I don't remember what it was he said. But he\nsaid, he hoped that things might yet turn out well; and then I was\nalmost sorry that I had written the letter.\"\n\n\"Of course you were sorry, and so you ought to have been. To say that\nyou would never call me Frank again!\"\n\n\"I didn't exactly say that.\"\n\n\"I have told him I will wait a fortnight, and so I will. After that,\nI shall take the matter into my own hands.\"\n\nIt may be well supposed that Lady Arabella was not well pleased to\nlearn that Frank and Mary had been again together; and, in the agony\nof her spirit, she did say some ill-natured things before Augusta,\nwho had now returned from Courcy Castle, as to the gross impropriety\nof Mary's conduct. But to Frank she said nothing.\n\nNor was there much said between Frank and Beatrice. If everything\ncould really be settled at the end of that fortnight which was to\nwitness the disclosure of the doctor's mystery, there would still\nbe time to arrange that Mary should be at the wedding. \"It shall be\nsettled then,\" he said to himself; \"and if it be settled, my mother\nwill hardly venture to exclude my affianced bride from the house.\"\nIt was now the beginning of August, and it wanted yet a month to the\nOriel wedding.\n\nBut though he said nothing to his mother or to Beatrice, he did say\nmuch to his father. In the first place, he showed him Mary's letter.\n\"If your heart be not made of stone it will be softened by that,\" he\nsaid. Mr Gresham's heart was not of stone, and he did acknowledge\nthat the letter was a very sweet letter. But we know how the drop of\nwater hollows stone. It was not by the violence of his appeal that\nFrank succeeded in obtaining from his father a sort of half-consent\nthat he would no longer oppose the match; but by the assiduity with\nwhich the appeal was repeated. Frank, as we have said, had more\nstubbornness of will than his father; and so, before the fortnight\nwas over, the squire had been talked over, and promised to attend at\nthe doctor's bidding.\n\n\"I suppose you had better take the Hazlehurst farm,\" said he to his\nson, with a sigh. \"It joins the park and the home-fields, and I will\ngive you up them also. God knows, I don't care about farming any\nmore--or about anything else either.\"\n\n\"Don't say that, father.\"\n\n\"Well, well! But, Frank, where will you live? The old house is big\nenough for us all. But how would Mary get on with your mother?\"\n\nAt the end of his fortnight, true to his time, the doctor returned to\nthe village. He was a bad correspondent; and though he had written\nsome short notes to Mary, he had said no word to her about his\nbusiness. It was late in the evening when he got home, and it was\nunderstood by Frank and the squire that they were to be with him on\nthe following morning. Not a word had been said to Lady Arabella on\nthe subject.\n\nIt was late in the evening when he got home, and Mary waited for him\nwith a heart almost sick with expectation. As soon as the fly had\nstopped at the little gate she heard his voice, and heard at once\nthat it was quick, joyful, and telling much of inward satisfaction.\nHe had a good-natured word for Janet, and called Thomas an old\nblunder-head in a manner that made Bridget laugh outright.\n\n\"He'll have his nose put out of joint some day; won't he?\" said the\ndoctor. Bridget blushed and laughed again, and made a sign to Thomas\nthat he had better look to his face.\n\nMary was in his arms before he was yet within the door. \"My darling,\"\nsaid he, tenderly kissing her. \"You are my own darling yet awhile.\"\n\n\"Of course I am. Am I not always to be so?\"\n\n\"Well, well; let me have some tea, at any rate, for I'm in a fever of\nthirst. They may call that tea at the Junction if they will; but if\nChina were sunk under the sea it would make no difference to them.\"\n\nDr Thorne always was in a fever of thirst when he got home from the\nrailway, and always made complaint as to the tea at the Junction.\nMary went about her usual work with almost more than her usual\nalacrity, and so they were soon seated in the drawing-room together.\n\nShe soon found that his manner was more than ordinarily kind to her;\nand there was moreover something about him which seemed to make him\nsparkle with contentment, but he said no word about Frank, nor did he\nmake any allusion to the business which had taken him up to town.\n\n\"Have you got through all your work?\" she said to him once.\n\n\"Yes, yes; I think all.\"\n\n\"And thoroughly?\"\n\n\"Yes; thoroughly, I think. But I am very tired, and so are you too,\ndarling, with waiting for me.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, I am not,\" said she, as she went on continually filling his\ncup; \"but I am so happy to have you home again. You have been away so\nmuch lately.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes; well I suppose I shall not go away any more now. It will be\nsomebody else's turn now.\"\n\n\"Uncle, I think you're going to take up writing mystery romances,\nlike Mrs Radcliffe's.\"\n\n\"Yes; and I'll begin to-morrow, certainly with-- But, Mary, I will\nnot say another word to-night. Give me a kiss, dearest, and I'll go.\"\n\nMary did kiss him, and he did go. But as she was still lingering in\nthe room, putting away a book, or a reel of thread, and then sitting\ndown to think what the morrow would bring forth, the doctor again\ncame into the room in his dressing-gown, and with the slippers on.\n\n\"What, not gone yet?\" said he.\n\n\"No, not yet; I'm going now.\"\n\n\"You and I, Mary, have always affected a good deal of indifference as\nto money, and all that sort of thing.\"\n\n\"I won't acknowledge that it has been an affectation at all,\" she\nanswered.\n\n\"Perhaps not; but we have often expressed it, have we not?\"\n\n\"I suppose, uncle, you think that we are like the fox that lost his\ntail, or rather some unfortunate fox that might be born without one.\"\n\n\"I wonder how we should either of us bear it if we found ourselves\nsuddenly rich. It would be a great temptation--a sore temptation. I\nfear, Mary, that when poor people talk disdainfully of money, they\noften are like your fox, born without a tail. If nature suddenly\nshould give that beast a tail, would he not be prouder of it than all\nthe other foxes in the wood?\"\n\n\"Well, I suppose he would. That's the very meaning of the story. But\nhow moral you've become all of a sudden at twelve o'clock at night!\nInstead of being Mrs Radcliffe, I shall think you're Mr \u00c3\u0086sop.\"\n\nHe took up the article which he had come to seek, and kissing her\nagain on the forehead, went away to his bed-room without further\nspeech. \"What can he mean by all this about money?\" said Mary to\nherself. \"It cannot be that by Sir Louis's death he will get any of\nall this property;\" and then she began to bethink herself whether,\nafter all, she would wish him to be a rich man. \"If he were very\nrich, he might do something to assist Frank; and then--\"\n\nThere never was a fox yet without a tail who would not be delighted\nto find himself suddenly possessed of that appendage. Never; let the\nuntailed fox have been ever so sincere in his advice to his friends!\nWe are all of us, the good and the bad, looking for tails--for one\ntail, or for more than one; we do so too often by ways that are\nmean enough: but perhaps there is no tail-seeker more mean, more\nsneakingly mean than he who looks out to adorn his bare back with a\ntail by marriage.\n\nThe doctor was up very early the next morning, long before Mary was\nready with her teacups. He was up, and in his own study behind the\nshop, arranging dingy papers, pulling about tin boxes which he had\nbrought down with him from London, and piling on his writing-table\none set of documents in one place, and one in another. \"I think I\nunderstand it all,\" said he; \"but yet I know I shall be bothered.\nWell, I never will be anybody's trustee again. Let me see!\" and then\nhe sat down, and with bewildered look recapitulated to himself sundry\nheavy items. \"What those shares are really worth I cannot understand,\nand nobody seems able to tell one. They must make it out among\nthem as best they can. Let me see; that's Boxall Hill, and this is\nGreshamsbury. I'll put a newspaper over Greshamsbury, or the squire\nwill know it!\" and then, having made his arrangements, he went to his\nbreakfast.\n\nI know I am wrong, my much and truly honoured critic, about these\ntitle-deeds and documents. But when we've got that barrister in\nhand, then if I go wrong after that, let the blame be on my own\nshoulders--or on his.\n\nThe doctor ate his breakfast quickly; and did not talk much to his\nniece. But what he did say was of a nature to make her feel strangely\nhappy. She could not analyse her own feelings, or give a reason for\nher own confidence; but she certainly did feel, and even trust, that\nsomething was going to happen after breakfast which would make her\nmore happy than she had been for many months.\n\n\"Janet,\" said he, looking at his watch, \"if Mr Gresham and Mr\nFrank call, show them into my study. What are you going to do with\nyourself, my dear?\"\n\n\"I don't know, uncle; you are so mysterious, and I am in such a\ntwitter, that I don't know what to do. Why is Mr Gresham coming\nhere--that is, the squire?\"\n\n\"Because I have business with him about the Scatcherd property. You\nknow that he owed Sir Louis money. But don't go out, Mary. I want you\nto be in the way if I should have to call for you. You can stay in\nthe drawing-room, can't you?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, uncle; or here.\"\n\n\"No, dearest; go into the drawing-room.\" Mary obediently did as she\nwas bid; and there she sat, for the next three hours, wondering,\nwondering, wondering. During the greater part of that time, however,\nshe well knew that Mr Gresham, senior, and Mr Gresham, junior, were\nboth with her uncle, below.\n\nAt eleven o'clock the doctor's visitors came. He had expected them\nsomewhat earlier, and was beginning to become fidgety. He had so much\non his hands that he could not sit still for a moment till he had, at\nany rate, commenced it. The expected footsteps were at last heard on\nthe gravel-path, and a moment or two afterwards Janet ushered the\nfather and son into the room.\n\nThe squire did not look very well. He was worn and sorrowful, and\nrather pale. The death of his young creditor might be supposed to\nhave given him some relief from his more pressing cares, but the\nnecessity of yielding to Frank's wishes had almost more than balanced\nthis. When a man has daily to reflect that he is poorer than he was\nthe day before, he soon becomes worn and sorrowful.\n\nBut Frank was well; both in health and spirits. He also felt as Mary\ndid, that the day was to bring forth something which should end his\npresent troubles; and he could not but be happy to think that he\ncould now tell Dr Thorne that his father's consent to his marriage\nhad been given.\n\nThe doctor shook hands with them both, and then they sat down. They\nwere all rather constrained in their manner; and at first it seemed\nthat nothing but little speeches of compliment were to be made. At\nlast, the squire remarked that Frank had been talking to him about\nMiss Thorne.\n\n\"About Mary?\" said the doctor.\n\n\"Yes; about Mary,\" said the squire, correcting himself. It was quite\nunnecessary that he should use so cold a name as the other, now that\nhe had agreed to the match.\n\n\"Well!\" said Dr Thorne.\n\n\"I suppose it must be so, doctor. He has set his heart upon it, and\nGod knows, I have nothing to say against her--against her personally.\nNo one could say a word against her. She is a sweet, good girl,\nexcellently brought up; and, as for myself, I have always loved her.\"\nFrank drew near to his father, and pressed his hand against the\nsquire's arm, by way of giving him, in some sort, a filial embrace\nfor his kindness.\n\n\"Thank you, squire, thank you,\" said the doctor. \"It is very good of\nyou to say that. She is a good girl, and if Frank chooses to take\nher, he will, in my estimation, have made a good choice.\"\n\n\"Chooses!\" said Frank, with all the enthusiasm of a lover.\n\nThe squire felt himself perhaps a little ruffled at the way in which\nthe doctor received his gracious intimation; but he did now show it\nas he went on. \"They cannot, you know, doctor, look to be rich\npeople--\"\n\n\"Ah! well, well,\" interrupted the doctor.\n\n\"I have told Frank so, and I think that you should tell Mary. Frank\nmeans to take some land into his hand, and he must farm it as a\nfarmer. I will endeavour to give him three, or perhaps four hundred a\nyear. But you know better--\"\n\n\"Stop, squire; stop a minute. We will talk about that presently. This\ndeath of poor Sir Louis will make a difference.\"\n\n\"Not permanently,\" said the squire mournfully.\n\n\"And now, Frank,\" said the doctor, not attending to the squire's last\nwords, \"what do you say?\"\n\n\"What do I say? I say what I said to you in London the other day. I\nbelieve Mary loves me; indeed, I won't be affected--I know she does.\nI have loved her--I was going to say always; and, indeed, I almost\nmight say so. My father knows that this is no light fancy of mine. As\nto what he says about our being poor, why--\"\n\nThe doctor was very arbitrary, and would hear neither of them on this\nsubject.\n\n\"Mr Gresham,\" said he, interrupting Frank, \"of course I am well aware\nhow very little suited Mary is by birth to marry your only son.\"\n\n\"It is too late to think about it now,\" said the squire.\n\n\"It is not too late for me to justify myself,\" replied the doctor.\n\"We have long known each other, Mr Gresham, and you said here the\nother day, that this is a subject as to which we have been both of\none mind. Birth and blood are very valuable gifts.\"\n\n\"I certainly think so,\" said the squire; \"but one can't have\neverything.\"\n\n\"No; one can't have everything.\"\n\n\"If I am satisfied in that matter--\" began Frank.\n\n\"Stop a moment, my dear boy,\" said the doctor. \"As your father says,\none can't have everything. My dear friend--\" and he gave his hand to\nthe squire--\"do not be angry if I alluded for a moment to the estate.\nIt has grieved me to see it melting away--the old family acres that\nhave so long been the heritage of the Greshams.\"\n\n\"We need not talk about that now, Dr Thorne,\" said Frank, in an\nalmost angry tone.\n\n\"But I must, Frank, for one moment, to justify myself. I could not\nhave excused myself in letting Mary think that she could become your\nwife if I had not hoped that good might come of it.\"\n\n\"Well; good will come of it,\" said Frank, who did not quite\nunderstand at what the doctor was driving.\n\n\"I hope so. I have had much doubt about this, and have been sorely\nperplexed; but now I do hope so. Frank--Mr Gresham--\" and then Dr\nThorne rose from his chair; but was, for a moment, unable to go on\nwith his tale.\n\n\"We will hope that it is all for the best,\" said the squire.\n\n\"I am sure it is,\" said Frank.\n\n\"Yes; I hope it is. I do think it is; I am sure it is, Frank. Mary\nwill not come to you empty-handed. I wish for your sake--yes, and for\nhers too--that her birth were equal to her fortune, as her worth is\nsuperior to both. Mr Gresham, this marriage will, at any rate, put an\nend to your pecuniary embarrassments--unless, indeed, Frank should\nprove a hard creditor. My niece is Sir Roger Scatcherd's heir.\"\n\nThe doctor, as soon as he made the announcement, began to employ\nhimself sedulously about the papers on the table; which, in the\nconfusion caused by his own emotion, he transferred hither and\nthither in such a manner as to upset all his previous arrangements.\n\"And now,\" he said, \"I might as well explain, as well as I can, of\nwhat that fortune consists. Here, this is--no--\"\n\n\"But, Dr Thorne,\" said the squire, now perfectly pale, and almost\ngasping for breath, \"what is it you mean?\"\n\n\"There's not a shadow of doubt,\" said the doctor. \"I've had Sir\nAbraham Haphazard, and Sir Rickety Giggs, and old Neversaye Die, and\nMr Snilam; and they are all of the same opinion. There is not the\nsmallest doubt about it. Of course, she must administer, and all\nthat; and I'm afraid there'll be a very heavy sum to pay for the tax;\nfor she cannot inherit as a niece, you know. Mr Snilam pointed that\nout particularly. But, after all that, there'll be--I've got it down\non a piece of paper, somewhere--three grains of blue pill. I'm really\nso bothered, squire, with all these papers, and all those lawyers,\nthat I don't know whether I'm sitting or standing. There's ready\nmoney enough to pay all the tax and all the debts. I know that, at\nany rate.\"\n\n\"You don't mean to say that Mary Thorne is now possessed of all Sir\nRoger Scatcherd's wealth?\" at last ejaculated the squire.\n\n\"But that's exactly what I do mean to say,\" said the doctor, looking\nup from his papers with a tear in his eye, and a smile on his\nmouth; \"and what is more, squire, you owe her at the present moment\nexactly--I've got that down too, somewhere, only I am so bothered\nwith all these papers. Come, squire, when do you mean to pay her?\nShe's in a great hurry, as young ladies are when they want to get\nmarried.\"\n\nThe doctor was inclined to joke if possible, so as to carry off, as\nit were, some of the great weight of obligation which it might seem\nthat he was throwing on the father and son; but the squire was by no\nmeans in a state to understand a joke: hardly as yet in a state to\ncomprehend what was so very serious in this matter.\n\n\"Do you mean that Mary is the owner of Boxall Hill?\" said he.\n\n\"Indeed, I do,\" said the doctor; and he was just going to add, \"and\nof Greshamsbury also,\" but he stopped himself.\n\n\"What, the whole property there?\"\n\n\"That's only a small portion,\" said the doctor. \"I almost wish it\nwere all, for then I should not be so bothered. Look here; these are\nthe Boxall Hill title-deeds; that's the simplest part of the whole\naffair; and Frank may go and settle himself there to-morrow if he\npleases.\"\n\n\"Stop a moment, Dr Thorne,\" said Frank. These were the only words\nwhich he had yet uttered since the tidings had been conveyed to him.\n\n\"And these, squire, are the Greshamsbury papers:\" and the doctor,\nwith considerable ceremony, withdrew the covering newspapers. \"Look\nat them; there they all are once again. When I suggested to Mr Snilam\nthat I supposed they might now all go back to the Greshamsbury\nmuniment room, I thought he would have fainted. As I cannot return\nthem to you, you will have to wait till Frank shall give them up.\"\n\n\"But, Dr Thorne,\" said Frank.\n\n\"Well, my boy.\"\n\n\"Does Mary know all about this?\"\n\n\"Not a word of it. I mean that you shall tell her.\"\n\n\"Perhaps, under such very altered circumstances--\"\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\n\"The change is so great and so sudden, so immense in its effects,\nthat Mary may perhaps wish--\"\n\n\"Wish! wish what? Wish not to be told of it at all?\"\n\n\"I shall not think of holding her to her engagement--that is, if--I\nmean to say, she should have time at any rate for consideration.\"\n\n\"Oh, I understand,\" said the doctor. \"She shall have time for\nconsideration. How much shall we give her, squire? three minutes? Go\nup to her Frank: she is in the drawing-room.\"\n\nFrank went to the door, and then hesitated, and returned. \"I could\nnot do it,\" said he. \"I don't think that I understand it all yet. I\nam so bewildered that I could not tell her;\" and he sat down at the\ntable, and began to sob with emotion.\n\n\"And she knows nothing of it?\" said the squire.\n\n\"Not a word. I thought that I would keep the pleasure of telling her\nfor Frank.\"\n\n\"She should not be left in suspense,\" said the squire.\n\n\"Come, Frank, go up to her,\" again urged the doctor. \"You've been\nready enough with your visits when you knew that you ought to stay\naway.\"\n\n\"I cannot do it,\" said Frank, after a pause of some moments; \"nor is\nit right that I should. It would be taking advantage of her.\"\n\n\"Go to her yourself, doctor; it is you that should do it,\" said the\nsquire.\n\nAfter some further slight delay, the doctor got up, and did go\nupstairs. He, even, was half afraid of the task. \"It must be done,\"\nhe said to himself, as his heavy steps mounted the stairs. \"But how\nto tell it?\"\n\nWhen he entered, Mary was standing half-way up the room, as though\nshe had risen to meet him. Her face was troubled, and her eyes were\nalmost wild. The emotion, the hopes, the fears of that morning had\nalmost been too much for her. She had heard the murmuring of the\nvoices in the room below, and had known that one of them was that\nof her lover. Whether that discussion was to be for her good or ill\nshe did not know; but she felt that further suspense would almost\nkill her. \"I could wait for years,\" she said to herself, \"if I did\nbut know. If I lost him, I suppose I should bear it, if I did but\nknow.\"--Well; she was going to know.\n\nHer uncle met her in the middle of the room. His face was serious,\nthough not sad; too serious to confirm her hopes at that moment of\ndoubt. \"What is it, uncle?\" she said, taking one of his hands between\nboth of her own. \"What is it? Tell me.\" And as she looked up into his\nface with her wild eyes, she almost frightened him.\n\n\"Mary,\" he said gravely, \"you have heard much, I know, of Sir Roger\nScatcherd's great fortune.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, yes!\"\n\n\"Now that poor Sir Louis is dead--\"\n\n\"Well, uncle, well?\"\n\n\"It has been left--\"\n\n\"To Frank! to Mr Gresham, to the squire!\" exclaimed Mary, who felt,\nwith an agony of doubt, that this sudden accession of immense wealth\nmight separate her still further from her lover.\n\n\"No, Mary, not to the Greshams; but to yourself.\"\n\n\"To me!\" she cried, and putting both her hands to her forehead, she\nseemed to be holding her temples together. \"To me!\"\n\n\"Yes, Mary; it is all your own now. To do as you like best with it\nall--all. May God, in His mercy, enable you to bear the burden, and\nlighten for you the temptation!\"\n\nShe had so far moved as to find the nearest chair, and there she\nwas now seated, staring at her uncle with fixed eyes. \"Uncle,\" she\nsaid, \"what does it mean?\" Then he came, and sitting beside her, he\nexplained, as best he could, the story of her birth, and her kinship\nwith the Scatcherds. \"And where is he, uncle?\" she said. \"Why does he\nnot come to me?\"\n\n\"I wanted him to come, but he refused. They are both there now, the\nfather and son; shall I fetch them?\"\n\n\"Fetch them! whom? The squire? No, uncle; but may we go to them?\"\n\n\"Surely, Mary.\"\n\n\"But, uncle--\"\n\n\"Yes, dearest.\"\n\n\"Is it true? are you sure? For his sake, you know; not for my own.\nThe squire, you know--Oh, uncle! I cannot go.\"\n\n\"They shall come to you.\"\n\n\"No--no. I have gone to him such hundreds of times; I will never\nallow that he shall be sent to me. But, uncle, is it true?\"\n\nThe doctor, as he went downstairs, muttered something about Sir\nAbraham Haphazard, and Sir Rickety Giggs; but these great names were\nmuch thrown away upon poor Mary. The doctor entered the room first,\nand the heiress followed him with downcast eyes and timid steps. She\nwas at first afraid to advance, but when she did look up, and saw\nFrank standing alone by the window, her lover restored her courage,\nand rushing up to him, she threw herself into his arms. \"Oh, Frank;\nmy own Frank! my own Frank! we shall never be separated now.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVII\n\nHow the Bride Was Received, and Who Were Asked to the Wedding\n\n\nAnd thus after all did Frank perform his great duty; he did marry\nmoney; or rather, as the wedding has not yet taken place, and is,\nindeed, as yet hardly talked of, we should more properly say that\nhe had engaged himself to marry money. And then, such a quantity of\nmoney! The Scatcherd wealth greatly exceeded the Dunstable wealth; so\nthat our hero may be looked on as having performed his duties in a\nmanner deserving the very highest commendation from all classes of\nthe de Courcy connexion.\n\nAnd he received it. But that was nothing. That _he_ should be f\u00c3\u00aated\nby the de Courcys and Greshams, now that he was about to do his duty\nby his family in so exemplary a manner: that he should be patted on\nthe back, now that he no longer meditated that vile crime which had\nbeen so abhorrent to his mother's soul; this was only natural; this\nis hardly worthy of remark. But there was another to be f\u00c3\u00aated,\nanother person to be made a personage, another blessed human mortal\nabout to do her duty by the family of Gresham in a manner that\ndeserved, and should receive, Lady Arabella's warmest caresses.\n\nDear Mary! It was, indeed, not singular that she should be prepared\nto act so well, seeing that in early youth she had had the advantage\nof an education in the Greshamsbury nursery; but not on that account\nwas it the less fitting that her virtue should be acknowledged,\neulogised, nay, all but worshipped.\n\nHow the party at the doctor's got itself broken up, I am not prepared\nto say. Frank, I know, stayed and dined there, and his poor mother,\nwho would not retire to rest till she had kissed him, and blessed\nhim, and thanked him for all he was doing for the family, was kept\nwaiting in her dressing-room till a very unreasonable hour of the\nnight.\n\nIt was the squire who brought the news up to the house. \"Arabella,\"\nhe said, in a low, but somewhat solemn voice, \"you will be surprised\nat the news I bring you. Mary Thorne is the heiress to all the\nScatcherd property!\"\n\n\"Oh, heavens! Mr Gresham.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" continued the squire. \"So it is; it is very, very--\"\nBut Lady Arabella had fainted. She was a woman who generally had her\nfeelings and her emotions much under her own control; but what she\nnow heard was too much for her. When she came to her senses, the\nfirst words that escaped her lips were, \"Dear Mary!\"\n\nBut the household had to sleep on the news before it could be fully\nrealised. The squire was not by nature a mercenary man. If I have at\nall succeeded in putting his character before the reader, he will be\nrecognised as one not over attached to money for money's sake. But\nthings had gone so hard with him, the world had become so rough, so\nungracious, so full of thorns, the want of means had become an evil\nso keenly felt in every hour, that it cannot be wondered at that his\ndreams that night should be of a golden elysium. The wealth was not\ncoming to him. True. But his chief sorrow had been for his son. Now\nthat son would be his only creditor. It was as though mountains of\nmarble had been taken from off his bosom.\n\nBut Lady Arabella's dreams flew away at once into the seventh heaven.\nSordid as they certainly were, they were not absolutely selfish.\nFrank would now certainly be the first commoner in Barsetshire; of\ncourse he would represent the county; of course there would be the\nhouse in town; it wouldn't be her house, but she was contented that\nthe grandeur should be that of her child. He would have heaven\nknows what to spend per annum. And that it should come through Mary\nThorne! What a blessing she had allowed Mary to be brought into the\nGreshamsbury nursery! Dear Mary!\n\n\"She will of course be one now,\" said Beatrice to her sister. With\nher, at the present moment, \"one\" of course meant one of the bevy\nthat was to attend her at the altar. \"Oh dear! how nice! I shan't\nknow what to say to her to-morrow. But I know one thing.\"\n\n\"What is that?\" asked Augusta.\n\n\"She will be as mild and as meek as a little dove. If she and the\ndoctor had lost every shilling in the world, she would have been as\nproud as an eagle.\" It must be acknowledged that Beatrice had had the\nwit to read Mary's character aright.\n\nBut Augusta was not quite pleased with the whole affair. Not that\nshe begrudged her brother his luck, or Mary her happiness. But her\nideas of right and wrong--perhaps we should rather say Lady Amelia's\nideas--would not be fairly carried out.\n\n\"After all, Beatrice, this does not alter her birth. I know it is\nuseless saying anything to Frank.\"\n\n\"Why, you wouldn't break both their hearts now?\"\n\n\"I don't want to break their hearts, certainly. But there are those\nwho put their dearest and warmest feelings under restraint rather\nthan deviate from what they know to be proper.\" Poor Augusta! she was\nthe stern professor of the order of this philosophy; the last in the\nfamily who practised with unflinching courage its cruel behests; the\nlast, always excepting the Lady Amelia.\n\nAnd how slept Frank that night? With him, at least, let us hope, nay,\nlet us say boldly, that his happiest thoughts were not of the wealth\nwhich he was to acquire. But yet it would be something to restore\nBoxall Hill to Greshamsbury; something to give back to his father\nthose rumpled vellum documents, since the departure of which the\nsquire had never had a happy day; nay, something to come forth again\nto his friends as a gay, young country squire, instead of as a\nfarmer, clod-compelling for his bread. We would not have him thought\nto be better than he was, nor would we wish him to make him of other\nstuff than nature generally uses. His heart did exult at Mary's\nwealth; but it leaped higher still when he thought of purer joys.\n\nAnd what shall we say of Mary's dreams? With her, it was altogether\nwhat she should give, not at all what she should get. Frank had loved\nher so truly when she was so poor, such an utter castaway; Frank, who\nhad ever been the heir of Greshamsbury! Frank, who with his beauty,\nand spirit, and his talents might have won the smiles of the richest,\nthe grandest, the noblest! What lady's heart would not have rejoiced\nto be allowed to love her Frank? But he had been true to her through\neverything. Ah! how often she thought of that hour, when suddenly\nappearing before her, he had strained her to his breast, just as she\nhad resolved how best to bear the death-like chill of his supposed\nestrangements! She was always thinking of that time. She fed her love\nby recurring over and over to the altered feeling of that moment. Any\nnow she could pay him for his goodness. Pay him! No, that would be a\nbase word, a base thought. Her payment must be made, if God would so\ngrant it, in many, many years to come. But her store, such as it was,\nshould be emptied into his lap. It was soothing to her pride that she\nwould not hurt him by her love, that she would bring no injury to the\nold house. \"Dear, dear Frank\" she murmured, as her waking dreams,\nconquered at last by sleep, gave way to those of the fairy world.\n\nBut she thought not only of Frank; dreamed not only of him. What had\nhe not done for her, that uncle of hers, who had been more loving to\nher than any father! How was he, too, to be paid? Paid, indeed! Love\ncan only be paid in its own coin: it knows of no other legal tender.\nWell, if her home was to be Greshamsbury, at any rate she would not\nbe separated from him.\n\nWhat the doctor dreamed of that, neither he or any one ever knew.\n\"Why, uncle, I think you've been asleep,\" said Mary to him that\nevening as he moved for a moment uneasily on the sofa. He had been\nasleep for the last three-quarters of an hour;--but Frank, his guest,\nhad felt no offence. \"No, I've not been exactly asleep,\" said he;\n\"but I'm very tired. I wouldn't do it all again, Frank, to double the\nmoney. You haven't got any more tea, have you, Mary?\"\n\nOn the following morning, Beatrice was of course with her friend.\nThere was no awkwardness between them in meeting. Beatrice had loved\nher when she was poor, and though they had not lately thought alike\non one very important subject, Mary was too gracious to impute that\nto Beatrice as a crime.\n\n\"You will be one now, Mary; of course you will.\"\n\n\"If Lady Arabella will let me come.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mary; let you! Do you remember what you said once about coming,\nand being near me? I have so often thought of it. And now, Mary, I\nmust tell you about Caleb;\" and the young lady settled herself on the\nsofa, so as to have a comfortable long talk. Beatrice had been quite\nright. Mary was as meek with her, and as mild as a dove.\n\nAnd then Patience Oriel came. \"My fine, young, darling, magnificent,\novergrown heiress,\" said Patience, embracing her. \"My breath deserted\nme, and I was nearly stunned when I heard of it. How small we shall\nall be, my dear! I am quite prepared to toady to you immensely; but\npray be a little gracious to me, for the sake of auld lang syne.\"\n\nMary gave a long, long kiss. \"Yes, for auld lang syne, Patience; when\nyou took me away under your wing to Richmond.\" Patience also had\nloved her when she was in her trouble, and that love, too, should\nnever be forgotten.\n\nBut the great difficulty was Lady Arabella's first meeting with her.\n\"I think I'll go down to her after breakfast,\" said her ladyship to\nBeatrice, as the two were talking over the matter while the mother\nwas finishing her toilet.\n\n\"I am sure she will come up if you like it, mamma.\"\n\n\"She is entitled to every courtesy--as Frank's accepted bride, you\nknow,\" said Lady Arabella. \"I would not for worlds fail in any\nrespect to her for his sake.\"\n\n\"He will be glad enough for her to come, I am sure,\" said Beatrice.\n\"I was talking with Caleb this morning, and he says--\"\n\nThe matter was of importance, and Lady Arabella gave it her most\nmature consideration. The manner of receiving into one's family an\nheiress whose wealth is to cure all one's difficulties, disperse\nall one's troubles, give a balm to all the wounds of misfortune,\nmust, under any circumstances, be worthy of much care. But when that\nheiress has been already treated as Mary had been treated!\n\n\"I must see her, at any rate, before I go to Courcy.\" said Lady\nArabella.\n\n\"Are you going to Courcy, mamma?\"\n\n\"Oh, certainly; yes, I must see my sister-in-law now. You don't seem\nto realise the importance, my dear, of Frank's marriage. He will be\nin a great hurry about it, and, indeed, I cannot blame him. I expect\nthat they will all come here.\"\n\n\"Who, mamma? the de Courcys?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course. I shall be very much surprised if the earl does not\ncome now. And I must consult my sister-in-law as to asking the Duke\nof Omnium.\"\n\nPoor Mary!\n\n\"And I think it will perhaps be better,\" continued Lady Arabella,\n\"that we should have a larger party than we intended at your affair.\nThe countess, I'm sure, would come now. We couldn't put it off for\nten days; could we, dear?\"\n\n\"Put it off ten days!\"\n\n\"Yes; it would be convenient.\"\n\n\"I don't think Mr Oriel would like that at all, mamma. You know he\nhas made all his arrangements for his Sundays--\"\n\nPshaw! The idea of the parson's Sundays being allowed to have any\nbearing on such a matter as Frank's wedding would now become! Why,\nthey would have--how much? Between twelve and fourteen thousand a\nyear! Lady Arabella, who had made her calculations a dozen times\nduring the night, had never found it to be much less than the larger\nsum. Mr Oriel's Sundays, indeed!\n\nAfter much doubt, Lady Arabella acceded to her daughter's suggestion,\nthat Mary should be received at Greshamsbury instead of being called\non at the doctor's house. \"If you think she won't mind the coming\nup first,\" said her ladyship. \"I certainly could receive her better\nhere. I should be more--more--more able, you know, to express what I\nfeel. We had better go into the big drawing-room to-day, Beatrice.\nWill you remember to tell Mrs Richards?\"\n\n\"Oh, certainly,\" was Mary's answer when Beatrice, with a voice a\nlittle trembling, proposed to her to walk up to the house. \"Certainly\nI will, if Lady Arabella will receive me;--only one thing, Trichy.\"\n\n\"What's that, dearest?\"\n\n\"Frank will think that I come after him.\"\n\n\"Never mind what he thinks. To tell you the truth, Mary, I often call\nupon Patience for the sake of finding Caleb. That's all fair now, you\nknow.\"\n\nMary very quietly put on her straw bonnet, and said she was ready\nto go up to the house. Beatrice was a little fluttered, and showed\nit. Mary was, perhaps, a good deal fluttered, but she did not show\nit. She had thought a good deal of her first interview with Lady\nArabella, of her first return to the house; but she had resolved\nto carry herself as though the matter were easy to her. She would\nnot allow it to be seen that she felt that she brought with her to\nGreshamsbury, comfort, ease, and renewed opulence.\n\nSo she put on her straw bonnet and walked up with Beatrice. Everybody\nabout the place had already heard the news. The old woman at the\nlodge curtsied low to her; the gardener, who was mowing the lawn; the\nbutler, who opened the front door--he must have been watching Mary's\napproach--had manifestly put on a clean white neckcloth for the\noccasion.\n\n\"God bless you once more, Miss Thorne!\" said the old man, in a\nhalf-whisper. Mary was somewhat troubled, for everything seemed,\nin a manner, to bow down before her. And why should not everything\nbow down before her, seeing that she was in truth the owner of\nGreshamsbury?\n\nAnd then a servant in livery would open the big drawing-room door.\nThis rather upset both Mary and Beatrice. It became almost impossible\nfor Mary to enter the room just as she would have done two years ago;\nbut she got through the difficulty with much self-control.\n\n\"Mamma, here's Mary,\" said Beatrice.\n\nNor was Lady Arabella quite mistress of herself, although she had\nstudied minutely how to bear herself.\n\n\"Oh, Mary, my dear Mary; what can I say to you?\" and then, with a\nhandkerchief to her eyes, she ran forward and hid her face on Miss\nThorne's shoulders. \"What can I say--can you forgive me my anxiety\nfor my son?\"\n\n\"How do you do, Lady Arabella?\" said Mary.\n\n\"My daughter! my child! my Frank's own bride! Oh, Mary! oh, my child!\nIf I have seemed unkind to you, it has been through love to him.\"\n\n\"All these things are over now,\" said Mary. \"Mr Gresham told me\nyesterday that I should be received as Frank's future wife; and so,\nyou see, I have come.\" And then she slipped through Lady Arabella's\narms, and sat down, meekly down, on a chair. In five minutes she\nhad escaped with Beatrice into the school-room, and was kissing the\nchildren, and turning over the new trousseau. They were, however,\nsoon interrupted, and there was, perhaps, some other kissing besides\nthat of the children.\n\n\"You have no business in here at all, Frank,\" said Beatrice. \"Has he,\nMary?\"\n\n\"None in the world, I should think.\"\n\n\"See what he has done to my poplin; I hope you won't have your things\ntreated so cruelly. He'll be careful enough about them.\"\n\n\"Is Oriel a good hand at packing up finery--eh, Beatrice?\" asked\nFrank.\n\n\"He is, at any rate, too well-behaved to spoil it.\" Thus Mary was\nagain made at home in the household of Greshamsbury.\n\nLady Arabella did not carry out her little plan of delaying the Oriel\nwedding. Her idea had been to add some grandeur to it, in order to\nmake it a more fitting precursor of that other greater wedding which\nwas to follow so soon in its wake. But this, with the assistance of\nthe countess, she found herself able to do without interfering with\npoor Mr Oriel's Sunday arrangements. The countess herself, with the\nLadies Alexandrina and Margaretta, now promised to come, even to this\nfirst affair; and for the other, the whole de Courcy family would\nturn out, count and countess, lords and ladies, Honourable Georges\nand Honourable Johns. What honour, indeed, could be too great to show\nto a bride who had fourteen thousand a year in her own right, or to a\ncousin who had done his duty by securing such a bride to himself!\n\n\"If the duke be in the country, I am sure he will be happy to come,\"\nsaid the countess. \"Of course, he will be talking to Frank about\npolitics. I suppose the squire won't expect Frank to belong to the\nold school now.\"\n\n\"Frank, of course, will judge for himself, Rosina;--with his\nposition, you know!\" And so things were settled at Courcy Castle.\n\nAnd then Beatrice was wedded and carried off to the Lakes. Mary, as\nshe had promised, did stand near her; but not exactly in the gingham\nfrock of which she had once spoken. She wore on that occasion-- But\nit will be too much, perhaps, to tell the reader what she wore as\nBeatrice's bridesmaid, seeing that a couple of pages, at least, must\nbe devoted to her marriage-dress, and seeing, also, that we have only\na few pages to finish everything; the list of visitors, the marriage\nsettlements, the dress, and all included.\n\nIt was in vain that Mary endeavoured to repress Lady Arabella's\nardour for grand doings. After all, she was to be married from the\ndoctor's house, and not from Greshamsbury, and it was the doctor\nwho should have invited the guests; but, in this matter, he did not\nchoose to oppose her ladyship's spirit, and she had it all her own\nway.\n\n\"What can I do?\" said he to Mary. \"I have been contradicting her in\neverything for the last two years. The least we can do is to let her\nhave her own way now in a trifle like this.\"\n\nBut there was one point on which Mary would let nobody have his or\nher own way; on which the way to be taken was very manifestly to be\nher own. This was touching the marriage settlements. It must not be\nsupposed, that if Beatrice were married on a Tuesday, Mary could be\nmarried on the Tuesday week following. Ladies with twelve thousand a\nyear cannot be disposed of in that way: and bridegrooms who do their\nduty by marrying money often have to be kept waiting. It was spring,\nthe early spring, before Frank was made altogether a happy man.\n\nBut a word about the settlements. On this subject the doctor thought\nhe would have been driven mad. Messrs Slow & Bideawhile, as the\nlawyers of the Greshamsbury family--it will be understood that Mr\nGazebee's law business was of quite a different nature, and his\nwork, as regarded Greshamsbury, was now nearly over--Messrs Slow &\nBideawhile declared that it would never do for them to undertake\nalone to draw out the settlements. An heiress, such as Mary, must\nhave lawyers of her own; half a dozen at least, according to the\napparent opinion of Messrs Slow & Bideawhile. And so the doctor had\nto go to other lawyers, and they had again to consult Sir Abraham,\nand Mr Snilam on a dozen different heads.\n\nIf Frank became tenant in tail, in right of his wife, but under his\nfather, would he be able to grant leases for more than twenty-one\nyears? and, if so, to whom would the right of trover belong? As to\nflotsam and jetsam--there was a little property, Mr Critic, on the\nsea-shore--that was a matter that had to be left unsettled at the\nlast. Such points as these do take a long time to consider. All\nthis bewildered the doctor sadly, and Frank himself began to make\naccusations that he was to be done out of his wife altogether.\n\nBut, as we have said, there was one point on which Mary would have\nher own way. The lawyers might tie up as they would on her behalf all\nthe money, and shares, and mortgages which had belonged to the late\nSir Roger, with this exception, all that had ever appertained to\nGreshamsbury should belong to Greshamsbury again; not in perspective,\nnot to her children, or to her children's children, but at once.\nFrank should be lord of Boxall Hill in his own right; and as to those\nother _liens_ on Greshamsbury, let Frank manage that with his father\nas he might think fit. She would only trouble herself to see that he\nwas empowered to do as he did think fit.\n\n\"But,\" argued the ancient, respectable family attorney to the doctor,\n\"that amounts to two-thirds of the whole estate. Two-thirds, Dr\nThorne! It is preposterous; I should almost say impossible.\" And the\nscanty hairs on the poor man's head almost stood on end as he thought\nof the outrageous manner in which the heiress prepared to sacrifice\nherself.\n\n\"It will all be the same in the end,\" said the doctor, trying to make\nthings smooth. \"Of course, their joint object will be to put the\nGreshamsbury property together again.\"\n\n\"But, my dear sir,\"--and then, for twenty minutes, the lawyer\nwent on proving that it would by no means be the same thing; but,\nnevertheless, Mary Thorne did have her own way.\n\nIn the course of the winter, Lady de Courcy tried very hard to induce\nthe heiress to visit Courcy Castle, and this request was so backed by\nLady Arabella, that the doctor said he thought she might as well go\nthere for three or four days. But here, again, Mary was obstinate.\n\n\"I don't see it at all,\" she said. \"If you make a point of it,\nor Frank, or Mr Gresham, I will go; but I can't see any possible\nreason.\" The doctor, when so appealed to, would not absolutely say\nthat he made a point of it, and Mary was tolerably safe as regarded\nFrank or the squire. If she went, Frank would be expected to go, and\nFrank disliked Courcy Castle almost more than ever. His aunt was now\nmore than civil to him, and, when they were together, never ceased to\ncompliment him on the desirable way in which he had done his duty by\nhis family.\n\nAnd soon after Christmas a visitor came to Mary, and stayed a\nfortnight with her: one whom neither she nor the doctor had expected,\nand of whom they had not much more than heard. This was the famous\nMiss Dunstable. \"Birds of a feather flock together,\" said Mrs\nRantaway--late Miss Gushing--when she heard of the visit. \"The\nrailway man's niece--if you can call her a niece--and the quack's\ndaughter will do very well together, no doubt.\"\n\n\"At any rate, they can count their money-bags,\" said Mrs Umbleby.\n\nAnd in fact, Mary and Miss Dunstable did get on very well together;\nand Miss Dunstable made herself quite happy at Greshamsbury, although\nsome people--including Mrs Rantaway--contrived to spread a report,\nthat Dr Thorne, jealous of Mary's money, was going to marry her.\n\n\"I shall certainly come and see you turned off,\" said Miss Dunstable,\ntaking leave of her new friend. Miss Dunstable, it must be\nacknowledged, was a little too fond of slang; but then, a lady with\nher fortune, and of her age, may be fond of almost whatever she\npleases.\n\nAnd so by degrees the winter wore away--very slowly to Frank, as he\ndeclared often enough; and slowly, perhaps, to Mary also, though she\ndid not say so. The winter wore away, and the chill, bitter, windy,\nearly spring came round. The comic almanacs give us dreadful pictures\nof January and February; but, in truth, the months which should be\nmade to look gloomy in England are March and April. Let no man boast\nhimself that he has got through the perils of winter till at least\nthe seventh of May.\n\nIt was early in April, however, that the great doings were to be done\nat Greshamsbury. Not exactly on the first. It may be presumed, that\nin spite of the practical, common-sense spirit of the age, very few\npeople do choose to have themselves united on that day. But some\nday in the first week of that month was fixed for the ceremony, and\nfrom the end of February all through March, Lady Arabella worked and\nstrove in a manner that entitled her to profound admiration.\n\nIt was at last settled that the breakfast should be held in the large\ndining-room at Greshamsbury. There was a difficulty about it which\ntaxed Lady Arabella to the utmost, for, in making the proposition,\nshe could not but seem to be throwing some slight on the house in\nwhich the heiress had lived. But when the affair was once opened to\nMary, it was astonishing how easy it became.\n\n\"Of course,\" said Mary, \"all the rooms in our house would not hold\nhalf the people you are talking about--if they must come.\"\n\nLady Arabella looked so beseechingly, nay, so piteously, that Mary\nhad not another word to say. It was evident that they must all come:\nthe de Courcys to the fifth generation; the Duke of Omnium himself,\nand others in concatenation accordingly.\n\n\"But will your uncle be angry if we have the breakfast up here? He\nhas been so very handsome to Frank, that I wouldn't make him angry\nfor all the world.\"\n\n\"If you don't tell him anything about it, Lady Arabella, he'll think\nthat it is all done properly. He will never know, if he's not told,\nthat he ought to give the breakfast, and not you.\"\n\n\"Won't he, my dear?\" And Lady Arabella looked her admiration for this\nvery talented suggestion. And so that matter was arranged. The doctor\nnever knew, till Mary told him some year or so afterwards, that he\nhad been remiss in any part of his duty.\n\nAnd who was asked to the wedding? In the first place, we have said\nthat the Duke of Omnium was there. This was, in fact, the one\ncircumstance that made this wedding so superior to any other that\nhad ever taken place in that neighbourhood. The Duke of Omnium never\nwent anywhere; and yet he went to Mary's wedding! And Mary, when\nthe ceremony was over, absolutely found herself kissed by a duke.\n\"Dearest Mary!\" exclaimed Lady Arabella, in her ecstasy of joy, when\nshe saw the honour that was done to her daughter-in-law.\n\n\"I hope we shall induce you to come to Gatherum Castle soon,\" said\nthe duke to Frank. \"I shall be having a few friends there in the\nautumn. Let me see; I declare, I have not seen you since you were\ngood enough to come to my collection. Ha! ha! ha! It wasn't bad fun,\nwas it?\" Frank was not very cordial with his answer. He had not quite\nreconciled himself to the difference of his position. When he was\ntreated as one of the \"collection\" at Gatherum Castle, he had not\nmarried money.\n\nIt would be vain to enumerate all the de Courcys that were there.\nThere was the earl, looking very gracious, and talking to the\nsquire about the county. And there was Lord Porlock, looking very\nungracious, and not talking to anybody about anything. And there was\nthe countess, who for the last week past had done nothing but pat\nFrank on the back whenever she could catch him. And there were the\nLadies Alexandrina, Margaretta, and Selina, smiling at everybody.\nAnd the Honourable George, talking in whispers to Frank about his\nwidow--\"Not such a catch as yours, you know; but something extremely\nsnug;--and have it all my own way, too, old fellow, or I shan't come\nto the scratch.\" And the Honourable John prepared to toady Frank\nabout his string of hunters; and the Lady Amelia, by herself, not\nquite contented with these democratic nuptials--\"After all, she is so\nabsolutely nobody; absolutely, absolutely,\" she said confidentially\nto Augusta, shaking her head. But before Lady Amelia had left\nGreshamsbury, Augusta was quite at a loss to understand how there\ncould be need for so much conversation between her cousin and Mr\nMortimer Gazebee.\n\nAnd there were many more de Courcys, whom to enumerate would be much\ntoo long.\n\nAnd the bishop of the diocese, and Mrs Proudie were there. A hint\nhad even been given, that his lordship would himself condescend to\nperform the ceremony, if this should be wished; but that work had\nalready been anticipated by a very old friend of the Greshams.\nArchdeacon Grantly, the rector of Plumstead Episcopi, had long since\nundertaken this part of the business; and the knot was eventually\ntied by the joint efforts of himself and Mr Oriel. Mrs Grantly came\nwith him, and so did Mrs Grantly's sister, the new dean's wife. The\ndean himself was at the time unfortunately absent at Oxford.\n\nAnd all the Bakers and the Jacksons were there. The last time they\nhad all met together under the squire's roof, was on the occasion of\nFrank's coming of age. The present gala doings were carried on in a\nvery different spirit. That had been a very poor affair, but this was\nworthy of the best days of Greshamsbury.\n\nOccasion also had been taken of this happy moment to make up, or\nrather to get rid of the last shreds of the last feud that had so\nlong separated Dr Thorne from his own relatives. The Thornes of\nUllathorne had made many overtures in a covert way. But our doctor\nhad contrived to reject them. \"They would not receive Mary as their\ncousin,\" said he, \"and I will go nowhere that she cannot go.\" But now\nall this was altered. Mrs Gresham would certainly be received in any\nhouse in the county. And thus, Mr Thorne of Ullathorne, an amiable,\npopular old bachelor, came to the wedding; and so did his maiden\nsister, Miss Monica Thorne, than whose no kinder heart glowed through\nall Barsetshire.\n\n\"My dear,\" said she to Mary, kissing her, and offering her some\nlittle tribute, \"I am very glad to make your acquaintance; very. It\nwas not her fault,\" she added, speaking to herself. \"And now that\nshe will be a Gresham, that need not be any longer thought of.\"\nNevertheless, could Miss Thorne have spoken her inward thoughts out\nloud, she would have declared, that Frank would have done better to\nhave borne his poverty than marry wealth without blood. But then,\nthere are but few so stanch as Miss Thorne; perhaps none in that\ncounty--always excepting Lady Amelia.\n\nAnd Miss Dunstable, also, was a bridesmaid. \"Oh, no\" said she, when\nasked; \"you should have them young and pretty.\" But she gave way when\nshe found that Mary did not flatter her by telling her that she was\neither the one or the other. \"The truth is,\" said Miss Dunstable, \"I\nhave always been a little in love with your Frank, and so I shall do\nit for his sake.\" There were but four: the other two were the Gresham\ntwins. Lady Arabella exerted herself greatly in framing hints to\ninduce Mary to ask some of the de Courcy ladies to do her so much\nhonour; but on this head Mary would please herself. \"Rank,\" said she\nto Beatrice, with a curl on her lip, \"has its drawbacks--and must put\nup with them.\"\n\nAnd now I find that I have not one page--not half a page--for the\nwedding-dress. But what matters? Will it not be all found written in\nthe columns of the _Morning Post_?\n\nAnd thus Frank married money, and became a great man. Let us hope\nthat he will be a happy man. As the time of the story has been\nbrought down so near to the present era, it is not practicable for\nthe novelist to tell much of his future career. When I last heard\nfrom Barsetshire, it seemed to be quite settled that he is to take\nthe place of one of the old members at the next election; and they\nsay, also, that there is no chance of any opposition. I have heard,\ntoo, that there have been many very private consultations between him\nand various gentlemen of the county, with reference to the hunt; and\nthe general feeling is said to be that the hounds should go to Boxall\nHill.\n\nAt Boxall Hill the young people established themselves on their\nreturn from the Continent. And that reminds me that one word must be\nsaid of Lady Scatcherd.\n\n\"You will always stay here with us,\" said Mary to her, caressing her\nladyship's rough hand, and looking kindly into that kind face.\n\nBut Lady Scatcherd would not consent to this. \"I will come and see\nyou sometimes, and then I shall enjoy myself. Yes, I will come and\nsee you, and my own dear boy.\" The affair was ended by her taking Mrs\nOpie Green's cottage, in order that she might be near the doctor; Mrs\nOpie Green having married--somebody.\n\nAnd of whom else must we say a word? Patience, also, of course, got\na husband--or will do so. Dear Patience! it would be a thousand\npities that so good a wife should be lost to the world. Whether Miss\nDunstable will ever be married, or Augusta Gresham, or Mr Moffat, or\nany of the tribe of the de Courcys--except Lady Amelia--I cannot say.\nThey have all of them still their future before them. That Bridget\nwas married to Thomas--that I am able to assert; for I know that\nJanet was much put out by their joint desertion.\n\nLady Arabella has not yet lost her admiration for Mary, and Mary,\nin return, behaves admirably. Another event is expected, and her\nladyship is almost as anxious about that as she was about the\nwedding. \"A matter, you know, of such importance in the county!\" she\nwhispered to Lady de Courcy.\n\nNothing can be more happy than the intercourse between the squire and\nhis son. What their exact arrangements are, we need not specially\ninquire; but the demon of pecuniary embarrassment has lifted his\nblack wings from the demesne of Greshamsbury.\n\nAnd now we have but one word left for the doctor. \"If you don't\ncome and dine with me,\" said the squire to him, when they found\nthemselves both deserted, \"mind I shall come and dine with you.\" And\non this principle they seem to act. Dr Thorne continues to extend\nhis practice, to the great disgust of Dr Fillgrave; and when Mary\nsuggested to him that he should retire, he almost boxed her ears. He\nknows the way, however, to Boxall Hill as well as he ever did, and is\nwilling to acknowledge, that the tea there is almost as good as it\never was at Greshamsbury.\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK DOCTOR THORNE***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 3166-8.txt or 3166-8.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/dirs\/3\/1\/6\/3166\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/pglaf.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":752,"split":"train"}
