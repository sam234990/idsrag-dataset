{"ori_id":"f91675dfda3bf99e3668a7f1ff06f9eacedaf28c","title":"Our Southern Highlanders","context":"Our Southern Highlanders\n The bulk of Our Southern Highlanders is based on observations Kephart made while at Hazel Creek (1904\u20131907), although several chapters added in 1922 were based on events that occurred later when Kephart lived in Bryson City. Chapters 9 (\"The Snake-Stick Man\") and 10 (\"A Raid into the Sugarlands\") were based on events that occurred in 1919. Chapter 11 (\"The Killing of Hol Rose\") was based on events that occurred in late 1920.\nChapter I, \"Something Hidden; Go and Find It,\" discusses the remoteness and ruggedness of the Southern Appalachian Mountains, the lack of realistic literature regarding its inhabitants, and gives a brief history of the region.\nChapter II, \"The Back of Beyond,\" gives a description of Medlin and discusses how the mountaineers have adapted to their environment, the difficulties in farming the rugged terrain, and grazing in the highland meadows.\nChapter III, \"The Great Smoky Mountains,\" discusses the topography, geology, wildlife and plant life of the Great Smokies range. Kephart also relates a story by a \"Mr. and Mrs. Ferris\" who ventured across the nearly-impassable crest of the central and eastern Smokies to Mount Guyot in search of plant specimens. He also discusses the harshness of the highland meadows, and recounts a story of 17 cattle freezing to death at Silers Meadow.\nChapter IV, \"A Bear Hunt in the Smokies,\" recounts a bear hunt undertaken by Kephart and several Hazel Creek natives. The party includes Granville Calhoun, a Bone Valley resident named Bill Cope (\"the hunchback\"), John Baker \"Little John\" Cable, Jr. (1855\u20131939), Matt Hyde, and Andrew Jackson \"Doc\" Jones (1851\u20131935). The chapter begins at Hall cabin amidst a windstorm and ends with the successful killing of a bear. This chapter contains one of the earliest references to the Appalachian folk song Cumberland Gap.\nChapter V, \"Moonshine Land,\" discusses Kephart's initial curiosity about moonshining, and recounts one mountaineer's justification for the practice.\nChapter VI, \"Ways That Are Dark,\" continues Kephart's discussion of moonshining, particularly how it is made in Southern Appalachia, the typical size and settings of stills, etc.\nChapter VII, \"A Leaf from the Past,\" traces the roots of moonshining to the British Isles, and explains how the practice made its way to Southern Appalachia.\nChapter VIII, \"Blockaders and the Revenue,\" discusses the ongoing conflict between moonshiners and federal revenue agents.\nChapter IX, \"The Snake-Stick Man,\" tells the story of a federal revenue agent whom Kephart calls \"Mr. Quick\" (an alias). Quick, who has a hobby of carving sticks into the form of snakes, has a polymathic expertise that Kephart finds most impressive. He is in the area to investigate illegal liquor sales at the nearby Cherokee Reservation.\nChapter X, \"A Raid into the Sugarlands,\" recounts a manhunt led by \"Mr. Quick\" into the Sugarlands, a remote valley south of Gatlinburg on the Tennessee side of the Smokies. The chapter includes an anachronistic story about a mountaineer named \"Jasper Fenn\" (based on a real-life Sugarlander named Davis Bracken, who lived near what is now the Chimneys Campground) who claimed to have read a copy of Our Southern Highlanders given to him by the Pi Beta Phi settlement school in Gatlinburg.\nChapter XI, \"The Killing of Hol Rose,\" recounts the killing of revenuer James Holland \"Hol\" Rose by J.E. \"Babe\" Burnett and Burnett's subsequent trial.\nChapter XII, \"The Outlander and the Native,\" discusses the mountaineers' attitudes toward outsiders.\nChapter XIII, \"The People of the Hills,\" describes the mountaineers' typical physical traits, work ethic, their ability to endure harsh conditions, and their general preference for mountain life over urban life.\nChapter XIV, \"The Land of Do Without,\" discusses the mountaineers' homelife, their manner of dress, the prevalence of poverty and the mountaineers' scorn of charity.\nChapter XV, \"Home Folks and Neighbor People,\" discusses gender and family roles, religion and funerary rights, music and dancing, and Christmas and New Years Day customs among the mountain people.\nChapter XVI, \"The Mountain Dialect,\" discusses mountain speech. Kephart's observations in this chapter mark one of the first serious analyses of the Southern Appalachian dialect, and one of the first to label it a distinct dialect rather than merely the speech habits of the uneducated. While Kephart overemphasizes archaic \"Elizabethan\" traits in the dialect, linguists acknowledge his keen observations and painstaking scholarship in this analysis.\nChapter XVII, \"The Law of the Wilderness,\" discusses the mountaineers' penchant for self-reliance and individualism, the importance of family bonds, and attitudes toward government.\nChapter XVIII, \"The Blood-Feud,\" discusses Appalachian clan feuding, its typical causes, and how it compares to other cultural clan feuds, such as Corsican vendettas.\nChapter XIV, \"Who Are the Mountaineers?\", traces the Scotch-Irish roots and migration patterns of the Southern Appalachian mountaineers, and emphasizes that the Appalachian culture is a distinct culture spread across the highlands of several states.\nChapter XX, \"When the Sleeper Awakes,\" discusses how encroaching commercialism and modernity, brought to the region by logging firms and other corporations, threatened to erode the mountain culture.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Our Southern Highlanders, by Horace Kephart\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Among reading people generally, South as well as North, to\nname him is to conjure up a tall, slouching figure in homespun, who\ncarries a rifle as habitually as he does his hat, and who may tilt its\nmuzzle toward a stranger before addressing him, the form of salutation\nbeing:\n\n\"Stop thar! Whut's you-unses name? Whar's you-uns a-goin' ter?\"\n\nLet us admit that there is just enough truth in this caricature to give\nit a point that will stick. Our typical mountaineer is lank, he is\nalways unkempt, he is fond of toting a gun on his shoulder, and his\ncuriosity about a stranger's name and business is promptly, though\npolitely, outspoken. For the rest, he is a man of mystery. The great\nworld outside his mountains knows almost as little about him as he does\nof it; and that is little indeed. News in order to reach him must be of\nsuch widespread interest as fairly to fall from heaven; correspondingly,\nscarce any incidents of mountain life will leak out unless they be of\nsensational nature, such as the shooting of a revenue officer in\nCarolina, the massacre of a Virginia court, or the outbreak of another\nfeud in \"bloody Breathitt.\" And so, from the grim sameness of such\nreports, the world infers that battle, murder, and sudden death are\ncommonplaces in Appalachia.\n\nTo be sure, in Miss Murfree's novels, as in those of John Fox, Jr., and\nof Alice MacGowan, we do meet characters more genial than feudists and\nillicit distillers; none the less, when we have closed the book, who is\nit that stands out clearest as type and pattern of the mountaineer? Is\nit not he of the long rifle and peremptory challenge? And whether this\nbe because he gets most of the limelight, or because we have a furtive\nliking for that sort of thing (on paper), or whether the armed outlaw be\nindeed a genuine protagonist--in any case, the Appalachian people remain\nin public estimation to-day, as Poe judged them, an uncouth and fierce\nrace of men, inhabiting a wild mountain region little known.\n\nThe Southern highlands themselves are a mysterious realm. When I\nprepared, eight years ago, for my first sojourn in the Great Smoky\nMountains, which form the master chain of the Appalachian system, I\ncould find in no library a guide to that region. The most diligent\nresearch failed to discover so much as a magazine article, written\nwithin this generation, that described the land and its people. Nay,\nthere was not even a novel or a story that showed intimate local\nknowledge. Had I been going to Teneriffe or Timbuctu, the libraries\nwould have furnished information a-plenty; but about this housetop of\neastern America they were strangely silent; it was _terra incognita_.\n\nOn the map I could see that the Southern Appalachians cover an area much\nlarger than New England, and that they are nearer the center of our\npopulation than any other mountains that deserve the name. Why, then, so\nlittle known? Quaintly there came to mind those lines familiar to my\nboyhood: \"Get you up this way southward, and go up into the mountain;\nand see the land, what it is; and the people that dwelleth therein,\nwhether they be strong or weak, few or many; and what the land is that\nthey dwell in, whether it be good or bad; and what cities they be that\nthey dwell in, whether in tents, or in strongholds; and what the land\nis, whether it be fat or lean, whether there be wood therein or not.\"\n\nIn that dustiest room of a great library where \"pub. docs.\" are stored,\nI unearthed a government report on forestry that gave, at last, a clear\nidea of the lay of the land. And here was news. We are wont to think of\nthe South as a low country with sultry climate; yet its mountain chains\nstretch uninterruptedly southwestward from Virginia to Alabama, 650\nmiles in an air line. They spread over parts of eight contiguous States,\nand cover an area somewhat larger than England and Scotland, or about\nthe same as that of the Alps. In short, the greatest mountain system of\neastern America is massed in our Southland. In its upper zone one sleeps\nunder blankets the year round.\n\nIn all the region north of Virginia and east of the Black Hills of\nDakota there is but one summit (Mount Washington, in New Hampshire) that\nreaches 6,000 feet above sea level, and there are only a dozen others\nthat exceed 5,000 feet. By contrast, south of the Potomac there are\nforty-six peaks, and forty-one miles of dividing ridges, that rise above\n6,000 feet, besides 288 mountains and some 300 miles of divide that\nstand more than 5,000 feet above the sea. In North Carolina alone the\nmountains cover 6,000 square miles, with an _average_ elevation of 2,700\nfeet, and with twenty-one peaks that overtop Mount Washington.\n\nI repeated to myself: \"Why, then, so little known?\" The Alps and the\nRockies, the Pyrennees and the Harz are more familiar to the American\npeople, in print and picture, if not by actual visit, than are the\nBlack, the Balsam, and the Great Smoky Mountains. It is true that summer\ntourists flock to Asheville and Toxaway, Linville and Highlands, passing\ntheir time at modern hotels and motoring along a few macadamed roads,\nbut what do they see of the billowy wilderness that conceals most of the\nnative homes? Glimpses from afar. What do they learn of the real\nmountaineer? Hearsay. For, mark you, nine-tenths of the Appalachian\npopulation are a sequestered folk. The typical, the average mountain\nman prefers his native hills and his primitive ancient ways.\n\nWe read more and talk more about the Filipinos, see more of the Chinese\nand the Syrians, than of these three million next-door Americans who are\nof colonial ancestry and mostly of British stock. New York, we say, is a\ncosmopolitan city; more Irish than in Dublin, more Germans than in\nMunich, more Italians than in Rome, more Jews than in nine Jerusalems;\nbut how many New Yorkers ever saw a Southern mountaineer? I am sure that\na party of hillsmen fresh from the back settlements of the Unakas, if\ndropped on the streets of any large city in the Union, and left to their\nown guidance, would stir up more comment (and probably more trouble)\nthan would a similar body of whites from any other quarter of the earth;\nand yet this same odd people is more purely bred from old American stock\nthan any other element of our population that occupies, by itself, so\ngreat a territory.\n\nThe mountaineers of the South are marked apart from all other folks by\ndialect, by customs, by character, by self-conscious isolation. So true\nis this that they call all outsiders \"furriners.\" It matters not whether\nyour descent be from Puritan or Cavalier, whether you come from\nBoston or Chicago, Savannah or New Orleans, in the mountains you are a\n\"furriner.\" A traveler, puzzled and scandalized at this, asked a native\nof the Cumberlands what he would call a \"Dutchman or a Dago.\" The fellow\nstudied a bit and then replied: \"Them's the outlandish.\"\n\n\n[Illustration: A Family of Pioneers in the Twentieth Century]\n\n\nForeigner, outlander, it is all one; we are \"different,\" we are \"quar,\"\nto the mountaineer. He knows he is an American; but his conception of\nthe metes and bounds of America is vague to the vanishing point. As for\ncountries over-sea--well, when a celebrated Nebraskan returned from his\ntrip around the globe, one of my backwoods neighbors proudly informed\nme: \"I see they give Bryan a lot of receptions when he kem back from the\nother world.\"\n\nNo one can understand the attitude of our highlanders toward the rest of\nthe earth until he realizes their amazing isolation from all that lies\nbeyond the blue, hazy skyline of their mountains. Conceive a shipload of\nemigrants cast away on some unknown island, far from the regular track\nof vessels, and left there for five or six generations, unaided and\nuntroubled by the growth of civilization. Among the descendants of such\na company we would expect to find customs and ideas unaltered from the\ntime of their forefathers. And that is just what we do find to-day among\nour castaways in the sea of mountains. Time has lingered in Appalachia.\nThe mountain folk still live in the eighteenth century. The progress of\nmankind from that age to this is no heritage of theirs.\n\nOur backwoodsmen of the Blue Ridge and the Unakas, of their connecting\nchains, and of the outlying Cumberlands, are still thinking essentially\nthe same thoughts, still living in much the same fashion, as did their\nancestors in the days of Daniel Boone. Nor is this their fault. They are\na people of keen intelligence and strong initiative when they can see\nanything to win. But, as President Frost says, they have been\n\"beleaguered by nature.\" They are belated--ghettoed in the midst of a\ncivilization that is as aloof from them as if it existed only on another\nplanet. And so, in order to be fair and just with these, our backward\nkinsmen, we must, for the time, decivilize ourselves to the extent of\n_going back_ and getting an eighteenth century point of view.\n\nBut, first, how comes it that the mountain folk have been so long\ndetached from the life and movement of their times? Why are they so\nforeign to present-day Americanism that they innocently call all the\nrest of us foreigners?\n\nThe answer lies on the map. They are creatures of environment, enmeshed\nin a labyrinth that has deflected and repelled the march of our nation\nfor three hundred years.\n\nIn 1728, when Colonel William Byrd, of Westover, was running the\nboundary line between Virginia and North Carolina, he finally was\nrepulsed by parallel chains of savage, unpeopled mountains that rose\ntier beyond tier to the westward, everywhere densely forested, and\nmatted into jungle by laurel and other undergrowth. In his _Journal_,\nwriting in the quaint, old-fashioned way, he said: \"Our country has now\nbeen inhabited more than 130 years by the English, and still we hardly\nknow anything of the Appalachian Mountains, that are nowhere above 250\nmiles from the sea. Whereas the French, who are later comers, have\nrang'd from Quebec Southward as far as the Mouth of Mississippi, in the\nbay of Mexico, and to the West almost as far as California, which is\neither way above 2,000 miles.\"\n\nA hundred and thirty years later, the same thing could have been said of\nthese same mountains; for the \"fierce and uncouth races of men\" that Poe\nfaintly heard of remained practically undiscovered until they startled\nthe nation on the scene of our Civil War, by sending 180,000 of their\nriflemen into the Union Army.\n\nIf a corps of surveyors to-day should be engaged to run a line due west\nfrom eastern Virginia to the Blue Grass of Kentucky, they would have an\narduous task. Let us suppose that they start from near Richmond and\nproceed along the line of 37\u00c2\u00b0 50'. The Blue Ridge is not especially\ndifficult: only eight transverse ridges to climb up and down in fourteen\nmiles, and none of them more than 2,000 feet high from bottom to top.\nThen, thirteen miles across the lower end of The Valley, a curious\nformation begins.\n\nAs a foretaste, in the three and a half miles crossing Little House and\nBig House mountains, one ascends 2,200 feet, descends 1,400, climbs\nagain 1,600, and goes down 2,000 feet on the far side. Beyond lie steep\nand narrow ridges athwart the way, paralleling each other like waves at\nsea. Ten distinct mountain chains are scaled and descended in the next\nforty miles. There are few \"leads\" rising gradually to their crests.\nEach and every one of these ridges is a Chinese wall magnified to\naltitudes of from a thousand to two thousand feet, and covered with\nthicket. The hollows between them are merely deep troughs.\n\nIn the next thirty miles we come upon novel topography. Instead of wave\nfollowing wave in orderly procession, we find here a choppy sea of small\nmountains, with hollows running toward all points of the compass.\nInstead of Chinese walls, we now have Chinese puzzles. The innate\nperversity of such configuration grows more and more exasperating as we\ntoil westward. In the two hundred miles from the Greenbrier to the\nKentucky River, the ridges are all but unscalable, and the streams\nsprangle in every direction like branches of mountain laurel.\n\nThe only roads follow the beds of tortuous and rock-strewn water\ncourses, which may be nearly dry when you start out in the morning, but\nwithin an hour may be raging torrents. There are no bridges. One may\nford a dozen times in a mile. A spring \"tide\" will stop all travel, even\nfrom neighbor to neighbor, for a day or two at a time. Buggies and\ncarriages are unheard of. In many districts the only means of\ntransportation is with saddlebags on horseback, or with a \"tow sack\"\nafoot. If the pedestrian tries a short-cut he will learn what the\nnatives mean when they say: \"Goin' up, you can might' nigh stand up\nstraight and bite the ground; goin' down, a man wants hobnails in the\nseat of his pants.\"\n\nJames Lane Allen was not writing fiction when he said of the far-famed\nWilderness Road into Kentucky: \"Despite all that has been done to\ncivilize it since Boone traced its course in 1790, this honored historic\nthoroughfare remains to-day as it was in the beginning, with all its\nsloughs and sands, its mud and holes, and jutting ledges of rock and\nloose boulders, and twists and turns, and general total depravity....\nOne such road was enough. They are said to have been notorious for\nprofanity, those who came into Kentucky from this side. Naturally. Many\nwere infidels--there are roads that make a man lose faith. It is known\nthat the more pious companies of them, as they traveled along, would now\nand then give up in despair, sit down, raise a hymn, and have prayers\nbefore they could go further. Perhaps one of the provocations to\nhomicide among the mountain people should be reckoned this road. I have\nseen two of the mildest of men, after riding over it for a few hours,\nlose their temper and begin to fight--fight their horses, fight the\nflies, fight the cobwebs on their noses.\"\n\nSuch difficulties of intercommunication are enough to explain the\nisolation of the mountaineers. In the more remote regions this\nloneliness reaches a degree almost unbelievable. Miss Ellen Semple, in a\nfine monograph published in the _Geographical Journal_, of London, in\n1901, gave us some examples:\n\n     \"These Kentucky mountaineers are not only cut off from the outside\n     world, but they are separated from each other. Each is confined to\n     his own locality, and finds his little world within a radius of a\n     few miles from his cabin. There are many men in these mountains who\n     have never seen a town, or even the poor village that constitutes\n     their county-seat.... The women ... are almost as rooted as the\n     trees. We met one woman who, during the twelve years of her married\n     life, had lived only ten miles across the mountain from her own\n     home, but had never in this time been back home to visit her father\n     and mother. Another back in Perry county told me she had never been\n     farther from home than Hazard, the county-seat, which is only six\n     miles distant. Another had never been to the post-office, four\n     miles away; and another had never seen the ford of the Rockcastle\n     River, only two miles from her home, and marked, moreover, by the\n     country store of the district.\"\n\n\nWhen I first went into the Smokies, I stopped one night in a single-room\nlog cabin, and soon had the good people absorbed in my tales of travel\nbeyond the seas. Finally the housewife said to me, with pathetic\nresignation: \"Bushnell's the furdest ever I've been.\" Bushnell, at that\ntime, was a hamlet of thirty people, only seven miles from where we sat.\nWhen I lived alone on \"the Little Fork of Sugar Fork of Hazel Creek,\"\nthere were women in the neighborhood, young and old, who had never seen\na railroad, and men who had never boarded a train, although the Murphy\nbranch ran within sixteen miles of our post-office. The first time that\na party of these people went to the railroad, they were uneasy and\nsuspicious. Nearing the way-station, a girl in advance came upon the\nfirst negro she ever saw in her life, and ran screaming back: \"My\ngoddamighty, Mam, thar's the boogerman--I done seed him!\"\n\nBut before discussing the mountain people and their problems, let us\ntake an imaginary balloon voyage over their vast domain. South of the\nPotomac the Blue Ridge is a narrow rampart rising abruptly from the\neast, one or two thousand feet above its base, and descending sharply to\nthe Shenandoah Valley on the west. Across the Valley begin the\nAlleghanies. These mountains, from the Potomac through to the northern\nTennessee border, consist of a multitude of narrow ridges with steep\nescarpment on both sides, running southwesterly in parallel chains, and\neach chain separated from its neighbors by deep, slender dales. Wherever\none goes westward from the Valley he will encounter tier after tier of\nthese ridges, as I have already described.\n\n\n[Illustration: Photo by U. S. Forest Service\n\n\"The very cliffs are sheathed with trees and shrubs\"--Linville River and\nFalls, N. C. The walls of one gorge are from 500 to 2,000 feet high.]\n\n\nAs a rule, the links in each chain can be passed by following small\ngaps; but often one must make very wide detours. For example, Pine\nMountain (every link has its own distinct name) is practically\nimpassable for nearly 150 miles, except for two water gaps and five\ndifficult crossings. Although it averages only a mile thick, the people\non its north side, generally, know less about those on the south than a\nMaine Yankee does about Pennsylvania Dutchmen.\n\nThe Alleghanies together have a width of from forty to sixty miles.\nWestward of them, for a couple of hundred miles, are the labyrinthine\nroughs of West Virginia and eastern Kentucky.\n\nIn southwestern Virginia the Blue Ridge and the Alleghanies coalesce,\nbut soon spread apart again, the Blue Ridge retaining its name, as well\nas its general character, although much loftier and more massive than in\nthe north. The southeast front of the Blue Ridge is a steep escarpment,\nrising abruptly from the Piedmont Plateau of Carolina. Not one river\ncuts through the Ridge, notwithstanding that the mountains to the\nwestward are higher and much more massive. It is the watershed of this\nwhole mountain region. The streams rising on its northwestern front flow\ndown into central plateaus, and thence cut their way through the Unakas\nin deep and precipitous gorges, draining finally into the Gulf of\nMexico, through the Tennessee, Ohio and Mississippi rivers.\n\nThe northwestern range, which corresponds to the Alleghanies of\nVirginia, now assumes a character entirely different from them. Instead\nof parallel chains of low ridges, we have here, on the border of North\nCarolina and Tennessee, a single chain that dwarfs all others in the\nAppalachian system. It is cut into segments by the rivers (Nolichucky,\nFrench Broad, Pigeon, Little Tennessee, Hiwassee) that drain the\ninterior plateaus, and each segment has a distinct name of its own\n(Iron, Northern Unaka, Bald, Great Smoky, Southern Unaka or Unicoi\nmountains). The Carolina mountaineers still call this system\ncollectively the Alleghanies, but the U. S. Geological Survey has given\nit a more distinctive name, the Unakas. While the Blue Ridge has only\nseven peaks that rise above 5,000 feet, the Unakas have 125 summits\nexceeding 5,000, and ten that are over 6,000 feet.\n\nConnecting the Unaka chain with the Blue Ridge are several transverse\nranges, the Stone, Beech, Roan, Yellow, Black, Newfound, Pisgah, Balsam,\nCowee, Nantahala, Tusquitee, and a few minor mountains, which as a whole\nare much higher than the Blue Ridge, 156 summits rising over 5,000\nfeet, and thirty-six over 6,000 feet above sea-level.\n\nIn northern Georgia the Unakas and the Blue Ridge gradually fade away\ninto straggling ridges and foothills, which extend into small parts of\nSouth Carolina and Alabama.\n\nThe Cumberland Plateau is not attached to either of these mountain\nsystems, but is rather a prolongation of the roughs of eastern Kentucky.\nIt is separated from the Unakas by the broad valley of the Tennessee\nRiver. The Plateau rises very abruptly from the surrounding plains. It\nconsists mainly of tableland gashed by streams that have cut their way\ndown in deep narrow gulches with precipitous sides.\n\nMost of the literature about our Southern mountaineers refers only to\nthe inhabitants of the comparatively meagre hills of eastern Kentucky,\nor to the Cumberlands of Tennessee. Little has been written about the\nreal mountaineers of southwestern Virginia, western North Carolina, and\nthe extreme north of Georgia. The great mountain masses still await\ntheir annalist, their artist, and, in some places, even their explorer.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\"THE BACK OF BEYOND\"\n\n\nOf certain remote parts of Erin, Jane Barlow says: \"In Bogland, if you\ninquire the address of such or such person, you will hear not very\ninfrequently that he or she lives 'off away at the Back of Beyond.'... A\nTraveler to the Back of Beyond may consider himself rather exceptionally\nfortunate, should he find that he is able to arrive at his destination\nby any mode of conveyance other than 'the two standin' feet of him.'\nOften enough the last stage of his journey proceeds down some boggy\n_boreen_, or up some craggy hill-track, inaccessible to any wheel or\nhoof that ever was shod.\"\n\nSo in Appalachia, one steps shortly from the railway into the primitive.\nMost of the river valleys are narrow. In their bottoms the soil is rich,\nthe farms well kept and generous, the owners comfortable and urbane. But\nfrom the valleys directly spring the mountains, with slopes rising\ntwenty to forty degrees or more. These mountains cover nine-tenths of\nwestern North Carolina, and among them dwell a majority of the native\npeople.\n\nThe back country is rough. No boat nor canoe can stem its brawling\nwaters. No bicycle nor automobile can enter it. No coach can endure its\nroads. Here is a land of lumber wagons, and saddle-bags, and shackly\nlittle sleds that are dragged over the bare ground by harnessed steers.\nThis is the country that ordinary tourists shun. And well for such that\nthey do, since whoso cares more for bodily comfort than for freedom and\nair and elbow-room should tarry by still waters and pleasant pastures.\nTo him the backwoods could be only what Burns called Argyleshire: \"A\ncountry where savage streams tumble over savage mountains, thinly\noverspread with savage flocks, which starvingly support as savage\ninhabitants.\"\n\nWhen I went south into the mountains I was seeking a Back of Beyond.\nThis for more reasons than one. With an inborn taste for the wild and\nromantic, I yearned for a strange land and a people that had the charm\nof originality. Again, I had a passion for early American history; and,\nin Far Appalachia, it seemed that I might realize the past in the\npresent, seeing with my own eyes what life must have been to my pioneer\nancestors of a century or two ago. Besides, I wanted to enjoy a free\nlife in the open air, the thrill of exploring new ground, the joys of\nthe chase, and the man's game of matching my woodcraft against the\nforces of nature, with no help from servants or hired guides.\n\nSo, casting about for a biding place that would fill such needs, I\npicked out the upper settlement of Hazel Creek, far up under the lee of\nthose Smoky Mountains that I had learned so little about. On the edge of\nthis settlement, scant two miles from the post-office of Medlin, there\nwas a copper mine, long disused on account of litigation, and I got\npermission to occupy one of its abandoned cabins.\n\nA mountain settlement consists of all who get their mail at the same\nplace. Ours was made up of forty-two households (about two hundred\nsouls) scattered over an area eight miles long by two wide. These are\nair-line measurements. All roads and trails \"wiggled and wingled around\"\nso that some families were several miles from a neighbor. Fifteen homes\nhad no wagon road, and could be reached by no vehicle other than a\nnarrow sled. Quill Rose had not even a sledpath, but journeyed full five\nmiles by trail to the nearest wagon road.\n\nMedlin itself comprised two little stores built of rough planks and\nbearing no signs, a corn mill, and four dwellings. A mile and a half\naway was the log schoolhouse, which, once or twice a month, served also\nas church. Scattered about the settlement were seven tiny tub-mills for\ngrinding corn, some of them mere open sheds with a capacity of about a\nbushel a day. Most of the dwellings were built of logs. Two or three,\nonly, were weatherboarded frame houses and attained the dignity of a\nstory and a half.\n\nAll about us was the forest primeval, where roamed some sparse herds of\ncattle, razorback hogs, and the wild beasts. Speckled trout were in all\nthe streams. Bears sometimes raided the fields, and wildcats were a\ncommon nuisance. Our settlement was a mere slash in the vast woodland\nthat encompassed it.\n\nThe post-office occupied a space about five feet square, in a corner of\none of the stores. There was a daily mail, by rider, serving four other\ncommunities along the way. The contractor for this service had to\nfurnish two horses, working turnabout, pay the rider, and squeeze his\nown profit, out of $499 a year. In Star Route days the mail was carried\nafoot, two barefooted young men \"toting the sacks on their own wethers\"\nover this thirty-two-mile round trip, for forty-eight cents a day; and\nthey boarded themselves!\n\nIn the group that gathered at mail time I often was solicited to \"back\"\nenvelopes, give out the news, or decipher letters for men who could not\nread. Several times, in the postmaster's absence, I registered letters\nfor myself, or for someone else, the law of the nation being suspended\nby general consent.\n\nOur stores, as I have said, were small, yet many of their shelves were\nempty. Oftentimes there was no flour to be had, no meat, cereals, canned\ngoods, coffee, sugar, or oil. It excited no comment at all when Old Pete\nwould lean across his bare counter and lament that \"Thar's lots o' folks\na-hurtin' around hyur for lard, and I ain't got none.\"\n\nI have seen the time when our neighborhood could get no salt nor tobacco\nwithout making a twenty-four-mile trip over the mountain and back, in\nthe dead of winter. This was due, partly, to the state of the roads, and\nto the fact that there would be no wagon available for weeks at a time.\nWagoning, by the way, was no sinecure. Often it meant to chop a fallen\ntree out of the road, and then, with handspikes, \"man-power the log\nouten the way.\" Sometimes an axle would break (far upon the mountain,\nof course); then a tree must be felled, and a new axle made on the spot\nfrom the green wood, with no tools but axe and jackknife.\n\n\n[Illustration: At the Post-Office]\n\n\nTrade was mostly by barter, in which 'coon skins and ginseng had the\nsame rank as in the days of Davy Crockett and Daniel Boone. Long credits\nwere given on anticipated crops; but the risks were great and the market\nlimited by local consumption, as it did not pay to haul bulky\ncommodities to the railroad. Hence it was self-preservation for the\nstorekeepers to carry only a slender stock of essentials and take pains\nto have little left through unproductive times.\n\nAs a rule, credit would not be asked so long as anything at all could be\noffered in trade. When Bill took the last quart of meal from the house,\nas rations for a bear hunt, his patient Marg walked five miles to the\nstore with a skinny old chicken, last of the flock, and offered to\nbarter it for \"a dustin' o' salt.\" There was not a bite in her house\nbeyond potatoes, and \"'taters don't go good 'thout salt.\"\n\nIn our primitive community there were no trades, no professions. Every\nman was his own farmer, blacksmith, gunsmith, carpenter, cobbler,\nmiller, tinker. Someone in his family, or a near neighbor, served him as\nbarber and dentist, and would make him a coffin when he died. One\nfarmer was also the wagoner of the district, as well as storekeeper,\nmagistrate, veterinarian, and accoucheur. He also owned the only\n\"tooth-pullers\" in the settlement: a pair of universal forceps that he\ndesigned, forged, filed out, and wielded with barbaric grit. His wife\nkept the only boarding-house for leagues around. Truly, an accomplished\ncouple!\n\nAbout two-thirds of our householders owned their homes. Of the remainder\nabout three-fifths were renters and two-fifths were squatters, in the\nsense that these last were permitted to occupy ground for the sake of\nreporting trespass and putting out fires--or, maybe, to prevent them\ndoing both. Nearly all of the wild land belonged to Northern timber\ncompanies who had not yet begun operations (they have done so within the\npast three years).\n\nTitles were confused, owing to careless surveys, or guesswork, in the\npast. Many boundaries overlapped, and there were bits of no-man's land\nhere and there, covered by no deed and subject to entry by anyone who\ndiscovered them. Our old frontier always was notorious for\nhappy-go-lucky surveys and neglect to make legal entry of claims. Thus\nBoone lost the fairest parts of the Kentucky he founded, and was\nejected and sent adrift. In our own time, overlapping boundaries have\nled to bitter litigation and murderous feuds.\n\nAs our territory was sparsely occupied, there were none of those\n\"perpendicular farms\" so noticeable in older settlements near the river\nvalleys, where men plow fields as steep as their own house roofs and\ntill with the hoe many an acre that is steeper still. John Fox tells of\na Kentucky farmer who fell out of his own cornfield and broke his neck.\nI have seen fields in Carolina where this might occur, as where a\nforty-five degree slope is tilled to the brink of a precipice. A woman\ntold me: \"I've hoed corn many a time on my knees--yes, I have;\" and\nanother: \"Many's the hill o' corn I've propped up with a rock to keep it\nfrom fallin' down-hill.\"[1]\n\nEven in our new region many of the fields suffered quickly from erosion.\nWhen a forest is cleared there is a spongy humus on the ground surface\nthat is extremely rich, but this washes away in a single season. The\nsoil beneath is good, but thin on the hillsides, and its soluble,\nfertile ingredients soon leach out and vanish. Without terracing, which\nI have never seen practiced in the mountains of the South, no field with\na surface slope of more than ten degrees (about two feet in ten) will\nlast more than a few years. As one of my neighbors put it: \"Thar, I've\ncl'ared me a patch and grubbed hit out--now I can raise me two or three\nsevere craps!\"\n\n\"Then what?\" I asked.\n\n\"When corn won't grow no more I can turn the field into grass a couple\no' years.\"\n\n\"Then you'll rotate, and grow corn again?\"\n\n\"La, no! By that time the land will be so poor hit wouldn't raise a\ncuss-fight.\"\n\n\"But then you must move, and begin all over again. This continual moving\nmust be a great nuisance.\"\n\nHe rolled his quid and placidly answered: \"Huk-uh; when I move, all I\nhaffter do is put out the fire and call the dog.\"\n\nHis apparent indifference was only philosophy expressed with sardonic\nhumor; just as another neighbor would say, \"This is good, strong land,\nor it wouldn't hold up all the rocks there is around hyur.\"\n\nRight here is the basis for much of what strangers call shiftlessness\namong the mountaineers. But of that, more anon in other chapters.\n\nIn clearing new ground, everyone followed the ancient custom of girdling\nthe tree trunks and letting them stand in spectral ugliness until they\nrotted and fell. This is a quick and easy way to get rid of the shade\nthat otherwise would stunt the crops, and it prevents such trees as\nchestnut, buckeye and basswood from sprouting from the stumps. In the\nfields stood scores of gigantic hemlocks, deadened, that never would be\nused even for fuel, save as their bark furnished the women with\nquick-burning stove-wood in wet weather. No one dreamt that hemlock ever\nwould be marketable. And this was only five years ago!\n\nThe tillage was as rude and destructive as anything we read of in\npioneer history. The common plow was a \"bull-tongue,\" which has aptly\nbeen described as \"hardly more than a sharpened stick with a metal rim.\"\nThe harrows were of wood, throughout, with locust teeth (a friend and I\nmade one from the green trees in half a day, and it lasted three seasons\non rocky ground). Sometimes no harrow was used at all, the plowed ground\nbeing \"drug\" with a big evergreen bough. This needed only to be withed\ndirectly to a pony's tail, as they used to do in ancient Ireland, and\nthe picture of prehistoric agriculture would have been complete. After\nthe corn was up, all cultivating was done with the hoe. For this the\nentire family turned out, the toddlers being left to play in the furrows\nwhile their mother toiled like a man.\n\nCorn was the staple crop--in fact, the only crop of most farmers. Some\nrye was raised along the creek, and a little oats, but our settlement\ngrew no wheat--there was no mill that could grind it. Wheat is raised,\nto some extent, in the river bottoms, and on the plateaus of the\ninterior. I have seen it flailed out on the bare ground, and winnowed by\npouring the grain and chaff from basket to basket while the women\nfluttered aprons or bed-sheets. Corn is topped for the blade-fodder, the\nears gathered from the stalk, and the main stalks afterwards used as\n\"roughness\" (roughage). The cribs generally are ramshackle pens, and\nthere is much waste from mold and vermin.\n\nThe Carolina mountains are, by nature, one of the best fruit regions in\neastern America. Apples, grapes, and berries, especially, thrive\nexceeding well. But our mountaineer is no horticulturist. He lets his\nfruit trees take care of themselves, and so, everywhere except on select\nfarms near the towns, we see old apple and peach trees that never were\npruned, bristling with shoots, and often bearing wizened fruit, dry and\nbitter, or half rotted on the stem.\n\nSo, too, the gardens are slighted. Late in the season our average garden\nis a miniature jungle, chiefly of weeds that stand high as one's head.\nCabbage and field beans survive and figure mightily in the diet of the\nmountaineer. Potatoes generally do well, but few farmers raise enough to\nsee them through the winter. Generally some tobacco is grown for family\nconsumption, the strong \"twist\" being smoked or chewed indifferently.\n\nAn interesting crop in our neighborhood was ginseng, of which there were\nseveral patches in cultivation. This curious plant is native throughout\nthe Appalachians, but has been exterminated in all but the wildest\nregions, on account of the high price that its dried root brings. It has\nlong since passed out of our pharmacopoeia, and is marketed only in\nChina, though our own people formerly esteemed it as a panacea for all\nills of the flesh. Colonel Byrd, in his \"History of the Dividing Line,\"\nsays of it:\n\n     \"Though Practice wilt soon make a man of tolerable Vigour an able\n     Footman, yet, as a help to bear Fatigue I us'd to chew a Root of\n     Ginseng as I Walk't along. This kept up my Spirits, and made me\n     trip away as nimbly in my half Jack-Boots as younger men cou'd in\n     their Shoes. This Plant is in high Esteem in China, where it sells\n     for its Weight in Silver.... Its vertues are, that it gives an\n     uncommon Warmth and Vigour to the Blood, and frisks the Spirits,\n     beyond any other Cordial. It chears the Heart, even of a Man that\n     has a bad Wife, and makes him look down with great Composure on the\n     crosses of the World. It promotes insensible Perspiration,\n     dissolves all Phlegmatick and Viscous Humours, that are apt to\n     obstruct the Narrow channels of the Nerves. It helps the Memory and\n     would quicken even Helvetian dullness. 'Tis friendly to the Lungs,\n     much more than Scolding itself. It comforts the Stomach, and\n     Strengthens the Bowels, preventing all Colicks and Fluxes. In one\n     Word, it will make a Man live a great while, and very well while he\n     does live. And what is more, it will even make Old Age amiable, by\n     rendering it lively, chearful, and good-humour'd.\"\n\n\nAlas that only Chinamen and eighteenth-century Cavaliers could absorb\nthe virtues of this sovereign herb!\n\nA successful ginseng grower of our settlement told me that two acres of\nthe plant will bring an income of $2,500 to $5,000 a year, planting\n100,000 to the acre. The roots take eight years to mature. They weigh\nfrom one and a half to four ounces each, when fresh, and one-third of\nthis dried. Two acres produce 25,000 roots a year, by progression. The\ndried root, at that time, brought five dollars a pound. At present, I\nbelieve, it is higher. Another friend of mine, who is in this business\nextensively, tried exporting for himself, but got only $6.50 a pound in\nAmoy, when the U. S. consul at that port assured him that the real\nmarket price was from $12.60 to $24.40. The local trader, knowing\nAmerican prices, pocketed the difference.\n\n\n[Illustration: The Author in Camp in the Big Smokies]\n\n\nIn times of scarcity many of our people took to the woods and gathered\ncommoner medicinal roots, such as bloodroot and wild ginger (there are\nscores of others growing wild in great profusion), but made only a\npittance at it, as synthetic drugs have mostly taken the place of herbal\nsimples in modern medicine. Women and children did better, in the days\nbefore Christmas, by gathering galax, \"hemlock\" (_leucothoe_), and\nmistletoe, selling to the dealers at the railroad, who ship them North\nfor holiday decorations. One bright lad from town informed me, with\nevident pride of geography, that \"Some of this goes to London, England.\"\nNearly everywhere in our woods the beautiful ruddy-bronze galax is\nabundant. Along the water-courses, _leucothoe_, which similarly turns\nbronze in autumn, and lasts throughout the winter, is so prolific as to\nbe a nuisance to travelers, being hard to push through.\n\nMost of our farmers had neither horse nor mule. For the rough work of\ncultivating the hillsides a single steer hitched to the \"bull-tongue\"\nwas better adapted, and the same steer patiently dragged a little sled\nto the trading post. On steep declivities the sled is more practical\nthan a cart or wagon, because it can go where wheels cannot, it does not\nrequire so wide a track, and it \"brakes\" automatically in going\ndownhill. Nearly all the farmer's hauling is downhill to his home, or\ndown farther to the village. A sled can be made quite easily by one man,\nout of wood growing on the spot, and with few iron fittings, or none at\nall. The runners are usually made of natural sourwood crooks, this\ntimber being chosen because it wears very smooth and does not fur up nor\nsplinter.\n\nThe hinterland is naturally adapted to grazing, rather than to\nagriculture. As it stands, the best pasturage is high up in the\nmountains, where there are \"balds\" covered with succulent wild grass\nthat resembles Kentucky bluegrass. Clearing and sowing would extend such\nareas indefinitely. The cattle forage for themselves through eight or\nnine months of the year, running wild like the razorbacks, and the only\nattention given them is when the herdsmen go out to salt them or to mark\nthe calves. Nearly all the beasts are scrub stock. Jerseys, and other\nblooded cattle thrive in the valleys, where there are no free ranges,\nbut the backwoodsman does not want \"critters that haffter be gentled and\nhand-fed.\" The result is that many families go without milk a great part\nof the year, and seldom indeed taste butter or beef.\n\nThe truth is that mountain beef, being fed nothing but grass and browse,\nwith barely enough corn and roughage to keep the animal alive through\nwinter, is blue-fleshed, watery, and tough. If properly reared, the\nquality would be as good as any. Almost any of our farmers could have\nhad a pasture near home and could have grown hay, but not one in ten\nwould take the trouble. His cattle were only for export--let the buyer\nfatten them! It should be understood that nobody had any provision for\ntaking care of fresh meat when the weather was not frosty.\n\nOn those rare occasions when somebody killed a beef, he had to travel\nall over the neighborhood to dispose of it in small portions. The\ncarcass was cut up in the same way as a hog, and all parts except the\ncheap \"bilin' pieces\" were sold at the same price: ten cents a pound, or\nwhatever they would bring on the spot. The butchering was done with an\naxe and a jackknife. The meat was either sliced thin and fried to a\ncrackling, or cut in chunks and boiled furiously just long enough to fit\nit for boot-heels. What the butcher mangled, the cook damned.\n\nFew sheep were raised in our settlement, and these only for their wool.\nThe untamed Smokies were no place for such defenseless creatures. Sheep\nwill not, cannot, run wild. They are wholly dependent on the fostering\nhand of man and perish without his shepherding. Curiously enough, our\nmountaineer knows little or nothing about the goat--an animal perfectly\nadapted to the free range of the Smokies. I am convinced that goats\nwould be more profitable to the small farmers of the wild mountains than\ncattle. Goats do not graze, but browse upon the shrubbery, of which\nthere is a vast superfluity in all the Southern mountains. Unlike the\nweak, timorous and stupid sheep, a flock of goats can fight their own\nbattles against wild animals. They are hardy in any weather, and thrive\nfrom their own pickings where other foragers would starve.\n\nA good milch goat gives more and richer milk than the average mountain\ncow. And a kid yields excellent fresh meat in _manageable_ quantity, at\na time when no one would butcher a beef because it would spoil. I used\nto shut my eyes and imagine the transformation that would be wrought in\nthese mountains by a colony of Swiss, who would turn the coves into\ngardens, the moderate slopes into orchards, the steeper ones into\nvineyards, by terracing, and who would export the finest of cheese made\nfrom the surplus milk of their goats. But our native mountaineers--well,\na man who will not eat beef nor drink fresh cow's milk, and who despises\nbutter, cannot be interested in anything of the dairy order.\n\nThe chickens ran wild and scratched for a living; hence were thin,\ntough, and poor layers. Eggs seldom were for sale. It was not of much\nuse to try to raise many chickens where they were unprotected from\nhawks, minks, foxes, weasels and snakes.\n\nHoney often was procured by spotting wild bees to their hoard and\nchopping the tree, a mild form of sport in which most settlers are\nexpert. Our local preacher had a hundred hives of tame bees, producing\n1,500 pounds of honey a year, for which he got ten cents a pound at the\nrailroad.\n\nThe mainstay of every farmer, aside from his cornfield, was his litter\nof razorback hogs. \"Old cornbread and sowbelly\" are a menu complete for\nthe mountaineer. The wild pig, roaming foot-loose and free over hill and\ndale, picks up his own living at all seasons and requires no attention\nat all. He is the cheapest possible source of meat and yields the\nquickest return: \"no other food animal can increase his own weight a\nhundred and fifty fold in the first eight months of his life.\" And so he\nis regarded by his owner with the same affection that Connemara Paddy\nbestows upon \"the gintleman that pays the rint.\"\n\nIn physique and mentality, the razorback differs even more from a\ndomestic hog than a wild goose does from a tame one. Shaped in front\nlike a thin wedge, he can go through laurel thickets like a bear.\nArmored with tough hide cushioned by bristles, he despises thorns,\nbrambles, and rattlesnakes, alike. His extravagantly long snout can\nscent like a cat's, and yet burrow, uproot, overturn, as if made of\nmetal. The long legs, thin flanks, pliant hoofs, fit him to run like a\ndeer and climb like a goat. In courage and sagacity he outranks all\nother beasts. A warrior born, he is also a strategist of the first\norder. Like man, he lives a communal life, and unites with others of his\nkind for purposes of defense.\n\nThe pig is the only large mammal I know of, besides man, whose eyes\nwill not shine by reflected light--they are too bold and crafty, I wit.\nThe razorback has a mind of his own; not instinct, but _mind_--whatever\npsychologists may say. He thinks. Anybody can see that when he is not\nrooting or sleeping he is studying devilment. He shows remarkable\nunderstanding of human speech, especially profane speech, and even an\nuncanny gift of reading men's thoughts, whenever those thoughts are\ndirected against the peace and dignity of pigship. He bears grudges,\nbroods over indignities, and plans redresses for the morrow or the week\nafter. If he cannot get even with you, he will lay for your unsuspecting\nfriend. And at the last, when arrested in his crimes and lodged in the\npen, he is liable to attacks of mania from sheer helpless rage.\n\nIf you camp out in the mountains, nothing will molest you but razorback\nhogs. Bears will flee and wildcats sneak to their dens, but the moment\nincense of cooking arises from your camp every pig within two miles will\nscent it and hasten to call. You may throw your arm out of joint: they\nwill laugh in your face. You may curse in five languages: it is music to\ntheir titillating ears.\n\nThroughout summer and autumn I cooked out of doors, on the woodsman's\nrange of forked stakes and a lug-pole spanning parallel beds of rock.\nWhen the pigs came, I fed them red-pepper pie. Then all said good-bye to\nmy hospitality save one slab-sided, tusky old boar--and he planned a\ncampaign. At the first smell of smoke he would start for my premises.\nHiding securely in a nearby thicket, he would spy on the operations\nuntil my stew got to simmering gently and I would retire to the cabin\nand get my fists in the dough. Then, charging at speed, he would knock\ndown a stake, trip the lug-pole, and send my dinner flying. Every day he\nwould do this. It got so that I had to sit there facing the fire all\nthrough my cooking, or that beast of a hog would ruin me. With this I\nthought he was outgeneraled. Idle dream! He would slip off to my\nfavorite neighbor's, break through the garden fence, and raise Ned\ninstanter--all because he hated _me_, for that peppery fraud, and knew\nthat Bob and I were cronies.\n\nI dubbed this pig Belial; a name that Bob promptly adapted to his own\nnotion by calling it Be-liar. \"That Be-liar,\" swore he, \"would cross\nhell on a rotten rail to git into my 'tater patch!\"\n\nFinally I could stand it no longer, and took down my rifle. It was a\nnail-driver, and I, through constant practice in beheading squirrels,\nwas in good form. However, in the mountains it is more heinous to kill\nanother man's pig than to shoot the owner. So I took craft for my guide,\nand guile for my heart's counsel. I stalked Belial as stealthily as ever\nhunter crept on an antelope against the wind. At last I had him dead\nright: broadside to me and motionless as if in a daydream. I knew that\nif I drilled his ear, or shot his tail clean off, it would only make him\nmeaner than ever. He sported an uncommonly fine tail, and was proud to\nflaunt it. I drew down on that member, purposely a trifle scant, fired,\nand--away scuttled that boar, with a _broken_ tail that would dangle and\ncling to him disgracefully through life.\n\n\n[Illustration: \"Bob\"]\n\n\nExit Belial! It was equivalent to a broken heart. He emigrated, or\ncommitted suicide, I know not which, but the Smoky Mountains knew him no\nmore.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTHE GREAT SMOKY MOUNTAINS\n\n\nFor a long time my chief interest was not in human neighbors, but in the\nmountains themselves--in that mysterious beckoning hinterland which rose\nright back of my chimney and spread upward, outward, almost to three\ncardinal points of the compass, mile after mile, hour after hour of\nlusty climbing--an Eden still unpeopled and unspoiled.\n\nI loved of a morning to slip on my haversack, pick up my rifle, or maybe\na mere staff, and stride forth alone over haphazard routes, to enjoy in\nmy own untutored way the infinite variety of form and color and shade,\nof plant and tree and animal life, in that superb wilderness that\ntowered there far above all homes of men. (And I love it still, albeit\nthe charm of new discovery is gone from those heights and gulfs that are\nnow so intimate and full of memories).\n\nThe Carolina mountains have a character all their own. Rising abruptly\nfrom a low base, and then rounding more gradually upward for 2,000 to\n5,000 feet above their valleys, their apparent height is more impressive\nthan that of many a loftier summit in the West which forms only a\nprotuberance on an elevated plateau. Nearly all of them are clad to\ntheir tops in dense forest and thick undergrowth. Here and there is a\ngrassy \"bald\": a natural meadow curiously perched on the very top of a\nmountain. There are no bare, rocky summits rising above timber-line, few\njutting crags, no ribs and vertebr\u00c3\u00a6 of the earth exposed. Seldom does\none see even a naked ledge of rock. The very cliffs are sheathed with\ntrees and shrubs, so that one treading their edges has no fear of\nfalling into an abyss.\n\nPinnacles or serrated ridges are rare. There are few commanding peaks.\nFrom almost any summit in Carolina one looks out upon a sea of flowing\ncurves and dome-shaped eminences undulating, with no great disparity of\nheight, unto the horizon. Almost everywhere the contours are similar:\nsteep sides gradually rounding to the tops, smooth-surfaced to the eye\nbecause of the endless verdure. Every ridge is separated from its\nsisters by deep and narrow ravines. Not one of the thousand water\ncourses shows a glint of its dashing stream, save where some far-off\nriver may reveal, through a gap in the mountain, one single shimmering\ncurve. In all this vast prospect, a keen eye, knowing where to look, may\ndetect an occasional farmer's clearing, but to the stranger there is\nonly mountain and forest, mountain and forest, as far as the eye can\nreach.\n\nCharacteristic, too, is the dreamy blue haze, like that of Indian summer\nintensified, that ever hovers over the mountains, unless they be swathed\nin cloud, or, for a few minutes, after a sharp rain-storm has cleared\nthe atmosphere. Both the Blue Ridge and the Smoky Mountains owe their\nnames to this tenuous mist. It softens all outlines, and lends a\nmirage-like effect of great distance to objects that are but a few miles\noff, while those farther removed grow more and more intangible until\nfinally the sky-line blends with the sky itself.\n\nThe foreground of such a landscape, in summer, is warm, soft, dreamy,\ncaressing, habitable; beyond it are gentle and luring solitudes; the\nremote ranges are inexpressibly lonesome, isolated and mysterious; but\neverywhere the green forest mantle bespeaks a vital present; nowhere\ndoes cold, bare granite stand as the sepulchre of an immemorial past.\n\nAnd yet these very mountains of Carolina are among the ancients of the\nearth. They were old, very old, before the Alps and the Andes, the\nRockies and the Himalayas were molded into their primal shapes. Upon\nthem, in after ages, were born the first hardwoods of America--perhaps\nthose of Europe, too--and upon them to-day the last great hardwood\nforests of our country stand in primeval majesty, mutely awaiting their\nimminent doom.\n\nThe richness of the Great Smoky forest has been the wonder and the\nadmiration of everyone who has traversed it. As one climbs from the\nriver to one of the main peaks, he passes successively through the same\nfloral zones he would encounter in traveling from mid-Georgia to\nsouthern Canada.\n\nStarting amid sycamores, elms, gums, willows, persimmons, chinquapins,\nhe soon enters a region of beech, birch, basswood, magnolia, cucumber,\nbutternut, holly, sourwood, box elder, ash, maple, buckeye, poplar,\nhemlock, and a great number of other growths along the creeks and\nbranches. On the lower slopes are many species of oaks, with hickory,\nhemlock, pitch pine, locust, dogwood, chestnut. In this region nearly\nall trees attain their fullest development. On north fronts of hills the\noaks reach a diameter of five to six feet. In cool, rich coves, chestnut\ntrees grow from six to nine feet across the stump; and tulip poplars up\nto ten or eleven feet, their straight trunks towering like gigantic\ncolumns, with scarcely a noticeable taper, seventy or eighty feet to the\nnearest limb.\n\nAscending above the zone of 3,000 feet, white oak is replaced by the no\nless valuable \"mountain oak.\" Beech, birch, buckeye, and chestnut\npersist to 5,000 feet. Then, where the beeches dwindle until adult trees\nare only knee-high, there begins a sub-arctic zone of black spruce,\nbalsam, striped maple, aspen and the \"Peruvian\" or red cherry.\n\nI have named only a few of the prevailing growths. Nowhere else in the\ntemperate zone is there such a variety of merchantable timber as in\nwestern Carolina and the Tennessee front of the Unaka system. About a\nhundred and twenty species of native trees grow in the Smoky Forest\nitself. When Asa Gray visited the North Carolina mountains he\nidentified, in a thirty-mile trip, a greater variety of indigenous trees\nthan could be observed in crossing Europe from England to Turkey, or in\na trip from Boston to the Rocky Mountain plateau. As John Muir has said,\nour forests, \"however slighted by man, must have been a great delight to\nGod; for they were the best He ever planted.\"\n\nThe undergrowth is of almost tropical luxuriance and variety. Botanists\nsay that this is the richest collecting ground in the United States.\nWhether one be seeking ferns or fungi or orchids or almost anything else\nvegetal, each hour will bring him some new delight. In summer the upper\nmountains are one vast flower garden: the white and pink of\nrhododendron, the blaze of azalea, conspicuous above all else, in\nsettings of every imaginable shade of green.\n\nIt was the botanist who discovered this Eden for us. Far back in the\neighteenth century, when this was still \"Cherokee Country,\" inhabited by\nno whites but a few Indian-traders, William Bartram of Philadelphia came\nplant-hunting into the mountains of western Carolina, and spread their\nfame to the world. One of his choicest finds was the fiery azalea, of\nwhich he recorded: \"The epithet fiery I annex to this most celebrated\nspecies of azalea, as being expressive of the appearance of its flowers;\nwhich are in general of the color of the finest red-lead, orange, and\nbright gold, as well as yellow and cream-color. These various splendid\ncolors are not only in separate plants, but frequently all the varieties\nand shades are seen in separate branches on the same plant; and the\nclusters of the blossoms cover the shrubs in such incredible profusion\non the hillsides that, suddenly opening to view from dark shades, we\nare alarmed with apprehension of the woods being set on fire. This is\ncertainly the most gay and brilliant flowering shrub yet known.\"\n\nAnd we of a later age, seeing the same wild gardens still unspoiled, can\nappreciate the almost religious fervor of those early botanists, as of\nMichaux, for example, who, in 1794, ascending the peak of Grandfather,\nbroke out in song: \"_Mont\u00c3\u00a9 au sommet de la plus haut montagne de tout\nl'Am\u00c3\u00a9rique Septentrionale, chante avec mon compagnon-guide l'hymn de\nMarsellois, et cri\u00c3\u00a9, 'Vive la Libert\u00c3\u00a9 et la R\u00c3\u00a9publique Fran\u00c3\u00a7aise!'_\"\n\nOf course Michaux was wildly mistaken in thinking Grandfather \"the\nhighest mountain in all North America.\" It is far from being even the\nhighest of the Appalachians. Yet we scarcely know to-day, to a downright\ncertainty, which peak is supreme among our Southern highlands. The honor\nis conceded to Mount Mitchell in the Black Mountains, northeast of\nAsheville. Still, the heights of the Carolina peaks have been taken\n(with but one exception, so far as I know) only by barometric\nmeasurements, and these, even when official, may vary as much as a\nhundred feet for the same mountain. Since the highest ten or a dozen of\nour Carolina peaks differ in altitude only one or two hundred feet,\ntheir actual rank has not yet been determined.\n\n\n[Illustration: Photo by U. S. Forest Service\n\n\"There are few jutting crags\"--Southeast profile of Whiteside Mountain,\nN. C.]\n\n\nFor a long time there was controversy as to whether Mount Mitchell or\nClingman Dome was the crowning summit of eastern America. The Coast and\nGeodetic Survey gave the height of Mount Mitchell as 6,688 feet; but\nlater figures of the U. S. Geological Survey are 6,711 and 6,712. In\n1859 Buckley claimed for Clingman Dome of the Smokies an altitude of\n6,941 feet. In recent government reports the Dome appears variously as\n6,619 and 6,660. In 1911 I was told by Mr. H. M. Ramseur that when he\nlaid out the route of the railroad from Asheville to Murphy he ran a\nline of levels from a known datum on this road to the top of Clingman,\nand that the result was \"four sixes\" (6,666 feet above sea-level). It is\nprobable that second place among the peaks of Appalachia may belong\neither to Clingman Dome or Guyot or LeConte, of the Smokies, or to\nBalsam Cone of the Black Mountains.\n\nIn any case, the Great Smoky mountains are the master chain of the\nAppalachian system, the greatest mass of highland east of the Rockies.\nThis segment of the Unakas forms the boundary between North Carolina\nand Tennessee from the Big Pigeon River to the McDaniel Bald.\n\nAlthough some parts of the Smokies are very rugged, with sharp changes\nof elevation, yet the range as a whole has no one dominating peak. Mount\nGuyot (pronounced _Gee_-o, with _g_ as in get), Mount LeConte, and\nClingman Dome all are over 6,600 feet and under 6,700, according to the\nmost trustworthy measurements. Many miles of the divide rise 6,000 feet\nabove sea-level, with only small undulations like ocean swells.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe most rugged and difficult part of the Smokies (and of the United\nStates east of Colorado) is in the sawtooth mountains between Collins\nand Guyot, at the headwaters of the Okona Lufty River. I know but few\nmen who have ever followed this part of the divide, although during the\npresent year trails have been cut from Clingman to Collins, or near it,\nand possibly others beyond to the northeastward.\n\nIn August and September, 1900, Mr. James H. Ferriss and wife,\nnaturalists from Joliet, Illinois, explored the Smokies to the Lufty Gap\nnortheast of Clingman, collecting rare species of snails and ferns. No\ndoubt Mrs. Ferriss is the only white woman who ever went beyond\nClingman or even ascended the Dome itself. She stayed at the Lufty Gap\nwhile her husband and a Carolina mountaineer of my acquaintance\nstruggled through to Guyot and returned. Of this trip Mr. Ferriss sent\nme the following account:\n\n\"We bought another axe of a moonshiner, and, with a week's provisions on\nour backs, one of the guides and I took the Consolidated American Black\nBear and Ruffed Grouse Line for Mount Guyot, twenty miles farther by map\nmeasurement. The bears were in full possession of the property, and we\ncould get no information in the settlements, as the settlers do not\ntravel this line. They did not know the names of the peaks other than as\ntops of the Great Smokies--knew nothing of the character of the country\nexcept that it was rough. The Tennesseeans seem afraid of the mountains,\nand the Cherokees of the North Carolina side equally so; for, two miles\nfrom camp, all traces of man, except surveyors' marks, had disappeared.\nIn the first two days we routed eight bears out of their nests and mud\nwallows, and they seemed to stay routed, for upon our return we found\nthe blackberry crop unharvested and had a bag pudding--'duff'--or what\nyou call it.\n\n\"A surveyor had run part of the line this year, which helped us\ngreatly, and the bears had made well-beaten trails part of the way. In\nplaces they had mussed up the ground as much as a barnyard. We tried to\nfollow the boundary line between the two States, which is exactly upon\nthe top of the Smokies, but often missed it. The government [state]\nsurveyor many years ago made two hacks upon the trees, but sometimes the\nlinemen neglected to use their axes for half a mile or so. It took us\nthree and one-half days to go, and two and one-half to return, and we\narose with the morning star and worked hard all day. The last day and a\nhalf, going, there was nothing to guide us but the old hacks.\n\n\"Equipped with government maps, a good compass, and a little conceit, I\nthought I could follow the boundary-line. In fact, at one time we\nintended to go through without a guide. A trail that runs through\nblackberry bushes two miles out of three is hard to follow. Then there\nwas a huckleberry bush reaching to our waists growing thickly upon the\nground as tomato vines, curled hard, and stubborn; and laurel much like\na field of lilac bushes, crooked and strong as iron. In one place we\nwalked fully a quarter of a mile over the tops of laurel bushes and\nthese were ten or twelve feet in height, but blown over one way by the\nwind. Much of the trail was along rocky edges, sometimes but six inches\nor so wide, but almost straight down on both sides for hundreds of feet.\nOne night, delayed by lack of water, we did not camp till dark, and,\nfinding a smooth spot, lay down with a small log on each side to hold us\nfrom rolling out of bed. When daylight came we found that, had we rolled\nover the logs, my partner would have dropped 500 feet into Tennessee and\nI would have dropped as far into North Carolina, unless some friendly\ntree top had caught us. Sometimes the mountain forked, and these ridges,\nconcealed by the balsams, would not be seen. Then there were round\nknobs--and who can tell where the highest ridge lies on a round mountain\nor a ball? My woolen shirt was torn off to the shoulders, and my\npartner, who had started out with corduroys, stayed in the brush until I\ngot him a pair of overalls from camp.\"\n\nEven to the west of Clingman a stranger is likely to find some\ndesperately rough travel if he should stray from the trail that follows\nthe divide. It is easy going for anyone in fair weather, but when cloud\nsettles on the mountain, as it often does without warning, it may be so\nthick that one cannot see a tree ten feet away. Under such circumstances\nI have myself floundered from daylight till dark through heart-breaking\nlaurel thickets, and without a bite to eat, not knowing whither I was\ngoing except that it was toward the Little Tennessee River.\n\nIn 1906 I spent the summer in a herders' hut on top of the divide, just\nwest of the Locust Ridge (miscalled Chestnut Ridge on the map), about\nsix miles east of Thunderhead. This time I had a partner, and we had a\nglorious three months of it, nearly a mile above sea-level, and only\nhalf a day's climb from the nearest settlement. One day I was alone,\nAndy having gone down to Medlin for the mail. It had rained a good\ndeal--in fact, there was a shower nearly every day throughout the\nsummer, the only semblance of a dry season in the Smokies being the\nautumn and early winter. The nights were cold enough for fires and\nblankets, even in our well-chinked cabin.\n\nWell, I had finished my lonesome dinner, and was washing up, when I saw\na man approaching. This was an event, for we seldom saw other men than\nour two selves. He was a lame man, wearing an iron extension on one\nfoot, and he hobbled with a cane. He looked played-out and gaunt. I met\nhim outside. He smiled as though I looked good to him, and asked with\nsome eagerness, \"Can I buy something to eat here?\"\n\n\"No,\" I answered, \"you can't buy anything here\"--how his face\nfell!--\"but I'll give you the best we have, and you're welcome.\"\n\nThen you should have seen that smile!\n\nHe seemed to have just enough strength left to drag himself into the\nhut. I asked no questions, though wondering what a cripple, evidently a\ngentleman, though in rather bad repair, was doing on top of the Smoky\nMountains. It was plain that he had spent more than one night\nshelterless in the cold rain, and that he was quite famished. While I\nwas baking the biscuit and cooking some meat, he told his story. This is\nthe short of it:\n\n\"I am a Canadian, McGill University man, electrician. My company sent me\nto Cincinnati. I got a vacation of a couple of weeks, and thought I'd\ntake a pedestrian tour. I can walk better than you'd think,\" and he\ntapped the short leg.\n\nI liked his grit.\n\n\"I knew no place to go,\" he continued; \"so I took a map and looked for\nwhat might be interesting country, not too far from Cincinnati. I picked\nout these mountains, got a couple of government topographical sheets,\nand, thinking they would serve like European ordnance maps, I had no\nfear of going astray. It was my plan to walk through to the Balsam\nMountains, and so on to the Big Pigeon River. I went to Maryville,\nTennessee, and there I was told that I would find a cabin every five or\nsix miles along the summit from Thunderhead to the Balsams.\"\n\nI broke in abruptly: \"Whoever told you that was either an impostor or an\nignoramus. There are only four of these shacks on the whole Smoky range.\nTwo of them, the Russell cabin and the Spencer place, you have already\npassed without knowing it. This is called the Hall cabin. None of these\nthree are occupied save for a week or so in the fall when the cattle are\nbeing rounded up, or by chance, as my partner and I happen to be here\nnow. Beyond this there is just one shack, at Siler's Meadow. It is down\nbelow the summit, hidden in timber, and you would never have seen it.\nEven if you had, you would have found it as bare as a last year's mouse\nnest, for nobody ever goes there except a few bear-hunters. From there\nonward for forty miles is an uninhabited wilderness so rough that you\ncould not make seven miles a day in it to save your life, even if you\nknew the course; and there is no trail at all. Those government maps\nare good and reliable to show the _approaches_ to this wild country, but\nwhere you need them most they are good for nothing.\"\n\n\n[Illustration: The Bears' Home--Laurel and Rhododendron]\n\n\n\"Then,\" said he, \"if I had missed your cabin I would have starved to\ndeath, for I depended on finding a house to the eastward, and would have\nfollowed the trail till I dropped. I have been out in the laurel\nthickets, now, three days and two nights; so nothing could have induced\nme to leave this trail, once I found it, or until I could see out to a\nhouse on one side or other of the mountain.\"\n\n\"You would see no house on either side from here to beyond Guyot, about\nforty miles. Had you no rations at all?\"\n\n\"I traveled light, expecting to find entertainment among the natives.\nHere is what I have left.\"\n\nHe showed me a crumpled buckwheat flapjack, a pinch of tea, and a couple\nof ounces of brandy.\n\n\"I was saving them for the last extremity; have had nothing to eat since\nyesterday morning. Drink the brandy, please; it came from Montreal.\"\n\n\"No, my boy, that liquor goes down your own throat instanter. You're the\nchap that needs it. This coffee will boil now in a minute. I won't give\nyou all the food you want, for it wouldn't be prudent; but by and by you\nshall have a bellyful.\"\n\nThen, as well as he could, he sketched the route he had followed. Where\nthe trail from Tennessee crosses from Thunderhead to Haw Gap he had\nswerved off from the divide, and he discovered his error somewhere in\nthe neighborhood of Blockhouse. There, instead of retracing his steps,\nhe sought a short-cut by plunging down to the headwaters of Haw Creek,\nthus worming deeper and deeper into the devil's nest. One more day would\nhave finished him. When I told him that the trip from Clingman to Guyot\nwould be hard work for a party of experienced mountaineers, and that it\nwould probably take them a week, during which time they would have to\npack all supplies on their own backs, he agreed that his best course\nwould be down into Carolina and out to the railroad.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOf animal life in the mountains I was most entertained by the raven.\nThis extraordinary bird was the first creature Noah liberated from the\nark--he must have known, even at that early period of nature study, that\nit was the most sagacious of all winged things. Or perhaps Noah and the\nraven did not get on well together and he rid himself of the pest at\nfirst opportunity. Doubtless there could have been no peace aboard a\ncraft that harbored so inquisitive and talkative a fowl. Anyway, the\nwild raven has been superlatively shy of man ever since the flood.\n\nProbably there is no place south of Labrador where our raven (_Corvus\ncorax principalis_) is seen so often as in the Smokies; and yet, even\nhere, a man may haunt the tops for weeks without sight or sound of the\nebon mystery--then, for a few days, they will be common. On the\nsoutheast side of the Locust Ridge, opposite Huggins's Hell, between\nBone Valley and the main fork of Hazel Creek, there is a \"Raven's Cliff\"\nwhere they winter and breed, using the same nests year after year.\nOccasionally one is trapped, with bloody groundhog for bait; but I have\nyet to meet a man who has succeeded in shooting one.\n\nIf the raven's body be elusive his tongue assuredly is not. No other\nanimal save man has anything like his vocal range. The raven croaks,\nclucks, caws, chuckles, squalls, pleads, \"pooh-poohs,\" grunts, barks,\nmimics small birds, hectors, cajoles--yes, pulls a cork, whets a scythe,\nfiles a saw--with his throat. As is well known, ravens can be taught\nhuman speech, like parrots; and I am told they show the same preference\nfor bad words--which, I think, is quite in character with their\nreputation as thieves and butchers. However, I may be prejudiced, seeing\nthat the raven's favorite dainties for his menu are the eyes of living\nfawns and lambs.\n\nA stranger in these mountains will be surprised at the apparent scarcity\nof game animals. It is not unusual for one to hunt all day in an\nabsolute wilderness, where he sees never a fresh track of man, and not\nget a shot at anything fit to eat. The cover is so dense that one\nstill-hunting (going without dogs) has poor chance of spying the game\nthat lurks about him; and there really is little of it by comparison\nwith such huntings fields as the Adirondacks, Maine, Canada, where game\nhas been conserved for many years. It used to be the same up there. The\nlate W. J. Stillman, writing in 1877 of the Maine woods, said:\n\n     \"The most striking feature of the forest, after one has become\n     habituated to the gloom, the pathlessness, and the apparent\n     impenetrability of the screen it forms around him, is the absence\n     of animal life. You may wander for hours without seeing a living\n     creature.... One thinks of the woods and the wild beasts; yet in\n     all the years of my wilderness living I can catalogue the wild\n     creatures other than squirrels, grouse, and small birds (never\n     plenty, generally very rare) which I have accidentally encountered\n     and seen while wandering for hunting or mere pastime in the wild\n     forest; one deer, one porcupine, one marten (commonly called\n     sable), and maybe half a dozen hares. You may walk hours and not\n     see a living creature larger than a fly, for days together and not\n     see a grouse, a squirrel, or a bird larger than the Canada jay....\n     Lands running with game are like those flowing with milk and honey;\n     and when the sporting books tell you that game is abundant, don't\n     imagine that you are assured from starvation thereby. I have been\n     reduced, in a country where deer were swarming, to live several\n     days together on corn meal.\"\n\n\nIt is much the same to-day in our Appalachian wilderness, where no\nprotection worthy the name has ever been afforded the game and fish\nsince Indian times. There is a class of woods-loafers, very common here,\nthat ranges the forest at all seasons with single-barrel shotguns or\n\"hog rifles,\" killing bearing females as well as legitimate game,\nfishing at night, even using dynamite in the streams; and so, in spite\nof the fact that there is no better game harborage granted by Nature on\nour continent than the Carolina mountains, the deer are all but\nexterminated in most districts, turkeys and even squirrels are rather\nscarce, and good trout fishing is limited to stocked waters or streams\nflowing through virgin forest. The only game animal that still holds his\nown is the black bear, and he endures in few places other than the\nroughest districts, such as that southwest of the Sugarland Mountains,\nwhere laurel and cliffs daunt all but the hardiest of men.\n\nThe only venomous snakes in the mountains are rattlers and copperheads,\nthe former common, the latter rare. The chance of being bitten by one is\nabout as remote as that of being struck by lightning--either accident\n_might_ happen, of course. The mountaineers have an absurd notion that\nthe little lizard so common in the hills is rank \"pizen.\" Oddly enough,\nthey call it a \"scorpion.\"\n\nFrom those two pests of the North Woods, black-flies and mosquitoes, the\nSmokies are mercifully exempt. At least there are no mosquitoes that\nbite or sting, except down in the river valleys where they have been\nintroduced by railroad trains--and even there they are but a feeble\nfolk. The reason is that in the mountains there is almost no standing\nwater where they can breed.\n\nOn the other hand, the common house-fly is extraordinarily numerous and\npersistent--a daily curse, even on top of Smoky. I imagine this is due\nto the wet climate, as in Ireland. Minute gnats (the \"punkies\" or\n\"no-see-ums\" of the North) are also offensively present in trout-fishing\ntime. And every cabin is alive with fleas. A hundred nights I have\nanointed myself with citronella from head to foot, and outsmelt a cheap\nbarber-shop, to escape their plague. In a tent, and without dogs, one\ncan be immune.\n\nIn most years there are very few chiggers, except on pine ridges. They\nare worse along rivers than in the mountains. The ticks of this country\nare not numerous, and seldom fasten on man.\n\nThe climate of the Carolina mountains is pleasantly cool in summer. Even\nat low altitudes (1,600 to 2,000 feet) the nights generally are\nrefreshing. It may be hot in the sun, but always cool in the shade. The\nair is drier (less relative humidity) than in the lowlands,\nnotwithstanding that there is greater rainfall here than elsewhere in\nthe United States outside of Florida and the Puget Sound country. The\nannual rainfall varies a great deal according to locality, being least\nat Asheville (42 inches) and greatest on the southeastern slope of the\nBlue Ridge, where as much as 105 inches has been recorded in a year. The\naverage rainfall of the whole region is 73 inches a year.[2]\n\nIn general the mornings are apt to be lowery, with fogs hanging low\nuntil, say, 9 o'clock, so that one cannot predict weather for the day.\nHeavy dews remain on the bushes until about the same hour.\n\nThe winters are short. What Northerners would call cold weather is not\nexpected until Christmas, and generally it is gone by the end of\nFebruary. Snow sometimes falls on the higher mountains by the first of\nOctober, and the last snow may linger there until April (exceptionally\nit falls in May). Tornadoes are unknown here, but sometimes a hurricane\nwill sweep the upper ranges. On April 19, 1900, a blizzard from the\nnorthwest struck the Smokies. In twenty minutes everything was frozen.\nAt Siler's Meadow seventeen cattle climbed upon each other for warmth\nand froze to death in a solid hecatomb. A herdsman who was out at the\ntime, and narrowly escaped a similar fate, assured me that \"that was the\nbeatenest snowstorm ever I seen.\" In the valleys there may be a few days\nin January and February when the mercury drops to zero or a few\ndegrees lower. On the high peaks, of course, the winter cold often is\nintense, and on the sunless north side of Clingman there are overhangs\nor crevices where a little ice may be found the year around.\n\n\n[Illustration: The old copper mine]\n\n\nUndoubtedly there is vast mineral wealth hidden in the Carolina\nmountains. A greater variety of minerals has been found here than in any\nother State save Colorado. But, for the present, it is a hard country to\nprospect in, owing to the thick covering of the forest floor. Not only\nis the underbrush very dense, but beneath it there generally is a thick\nstratum of clay overlaying the rocks, even on steep slopes. Gold has\nbeen found in numberless places, but finely disseminated. I do not know\na locality in the mountains proper where a working vein has been\ndiscovered. At my cabin I did just enough panning to get a notion that\nif I could stand working in icy water ten hours a day I might average a\ndollar in yellow dust by it. The adjacent copper mine carries\nconsiderable gold. Silver and lead are not common, so far as known, but\nthere are many good copper and iron properties. Gems are mined\nprofitably in several of the western counties. The corundum, mica, talc,\nand monazite are, I believe, unexcelled in the United States. Building\nstone is abundant, and there is fine marble in various places. Kaolin is\nshipped out in considerable quantities. The rocks chiefly are gneisses,\ngranites, metamorphosed marbles, quartzites, and slates, all of them far\ntoo old to bear fossils or coal.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nA BEAR HUNT IN THE SMOKIES\n\n\n\"Git up, pup! you've scrouged right in hyur in front of the fire. You\nDred! what makes you so blamed contentious?\"\n\nLittle John shoved both dogs into a corner, and strove to scrape some\ncoals from under a beech forestick that glowed almost hot enough to melt\nbrass.\n\n\"This is the wust coggled-up fire I ever seed, to fry by. Bill, hand me\nsome Old Ned from that suggin o' mine.\"\n\nA bearded hunchback reached his long arm to a sack that hung under our\nrifles, drew out a chuck of salt pork, and began slicing it with his\njackknife. On inquiry I learned that \"Old Ned\" is merely slang for fat\npork, but that \"suggin\" or \"sujjit\" (the _u_ pronounced like _oo_ in\nlook) is true mountain dialect for a pouch, valise, or carryall, its\netymology being something to puzzle over.\n\nFour dogs growled at each other under a long bunk of poles and hay that\nspanned one side of our cabin. The fire glared out upon the middle of an\nunfloored and windowless room. Deep shadows clung to the walls and\nbenches, charitably concealing much dirt and disorder left by previous\noccupants, much litter of our own contributing.\n\nAt last we were on a saddle of the divide, a mile above sea-level, in a\nhut built years ago for temporary lodgment of cattle-men herding on the\ngrassy \"balds\" of the Smokies. A sagging clapboard roof covered its two\nrooms and the open space between them that we called our \"entry.\" The\nState line between North Carolina and Tennessee ran through this\nuninclosed hallway. The Carolina room had a puncheon floor and a\nclapboard table, also better bunks than its mate; but there had risen a\nstiff southerly gale that made the chimney smoke so abominably that we\nwere forced to take quarters in the neighbor State.\n\nGranville lifted the lid from a big Dutch oven and reported \"Bread's\ndone.\"\n\nThere was a flash in the frying-pan, a curse and a puff from Little\nJohn. The coffee-pot boiled over. We gathered about the hewn benches\nthat served for tables, and sat _\u00c3\u00a0 la Turc_ upon the ground. For some\ntime there was no sound but the gale without and the munching of\nravenous men.\n\n\"If this wind 'll only cease afore mornin', we'll git us a bear\nto-morrow.\"\n\nA powerful gust struck the cabin, by way of answer; a great roaring\nsurged up from the gulf of Defeat, from Desolation, and from the other\nforks of Bone Valley--clamor of ten thousand trees struggling with the\nblast.\n\n\"Hit's gittin' wusser.\"\n\n\"Any danger of this roost being blown off the mountain?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Hit's stood hyur twenty year through all the storms; I reckon it can\nstand one more night of it.\"\n\n\"A man couldn't walk upright, outside the cabin,\" I asserted, thinking\nof the St. Louis tornado, in which I had lain flat on my belly, clinging\nto an iron post.\n\nThe hunchback turned to me with a grave face. \"I've seed hit blow, here\non top o' Smoky, till a hoss couldn't stand up agin it. You'll spy,\nto-morrow, whar several trees has been wind-throwed and busted to\nkindlin'.\"\n\nI recalled that several, in the South, means many--\"a good many,\" as our\nown tongues phrase it.\n\n\"Oh, shucks! Bill Cope,\" put in \"Doc\" Jones, \"whut do you-uns know about\nwindstorms? Now, _I've_ hed some experiencin' up hyur that 'll do to tell\nabout. You remember the big storm three year ago, come grass, when the\ncattle all huddled up a-top o' each other and friz in one pile, solid.\"\n\nBill grunted an affirmative.\n\n\"Wal, sir, I was a-herdin', over at the Spencer Place, and was out on\nThunderhead when the wind sprung up. Thar come one turrible vyg'rous\nblow that jest nacherally lifted the ground. I went up in the sky, my\ncoat ripped off, and I went a-sailin' end-over-end.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Yes. About half an hour later, I lit _spang_ in the mud, way down\nyander in Tuckaleechee Cove--yes, sir: ten mile as the crow flies, and a\nmile deeper 'n trout-fish swim.\"\n\nThere was silence for a moment. Then Little John spoke up: \"I mind about\nthat time, Doc; but I disremember which buryin'-ground they-all planted\nye in.\"\n\n\"Planted! _Me?_ Huh! But I had one tormentin' time findin' my hat!\"\n\nThe cabin shook under a heavier blast, to match Bill's yarn.\n\n\"Old Wind-maker's blowin' liars out o' North Car'lina. Hang on to yer\nhat, Doc! Whoop! hear 'em a-comin'!\"\n\n\"Durn this blow, anyhow! No bear 'll cross the mountain sich a night as\nthis.\"\n\n\"Can't we hunt down on the Carolina side?\" I asked.\n\n\"That's whar we're goin' to drive; but hit's no use if the bear don't\ncome over.\"\n\n\"How is that? Do they sleep in one State and eat in the other?\"\n\n\"Yes: you see, the Tennessee side of the mountain is powerful steep and\nlaurely, so 't man nor dog cain't git over it in lots o' places; that's\nwhar the bears den. But the mast, sich as acorns and beech and hickory\nnuts, is mostly on the Car'lina side; that's whar they hafter come to\nfeed. So, when it blows like this, they stay at home and suck their paws\ntill the weather clars.\"\n\n\"So we'll have to do, at this rate.\"\n\n\"I'll go see whut the el-e-ments looks like.\"\n\nWe arose from our squatting postures. John opened the little clapboard\ndoor, which swung violently backward as another gust boomed against the\ncabin. Dust and hot ashes scattered in every direction. The dogs sprang\nup, one encroached upon another, and they flew at each other's throats.\nThey were powerful beasts, dangerous to man as well as to the brutes\nthey were trained to fight; but John was their master, and he soon\nbooted them into surly subjection.\n\n\"The older dog don't ginerally raise no ruction; hit's the younger one\nthat's ill,\" by which he meant vicious. \"You, Coaly, you'll git some o'\nthat meanness shuck outen you if you tackle an old she-bear to-morrow!\"\n\n\"Has the young dog ever fought a bear?\"\n\n\"No; he don't know nothin'; but I reckon he'll pick up some larnin' in\nthe next two, three days.\"\n\n\"Have these dogs got the Plott strain? I've been told that the Plott\nhounds are the best bear dogs in the country.\"\n\n\"'Tain't so,\" snorted John. \"The Plott curs are the best: that is, half\nhound, half cur--though what we-uns calls the cur, in this case, raelly\ncomes from a big furrin dog that I don't rightly know the breed of.\nFellers, you can talk as you please about a streak o' the cur spilin' a\ndog; but I know hit ain't so--not for bear fightin' in these mountains,\nwhar you cain't foller up on hossback, but hafter do your own runnin'.\"\n\n\"What is the reason, John?\"\n\n\n[Illustration: \"What soldiers these fellows would make, under leadership\nof some Backwoods Napoleon!\"]\n\n\n\"Waal, hit's like this: a plumb cur, of course, cain't foller a cold\ntrack--he just runs by sight; and he won't hang--he quits. But,\nt'other way, no hound 'll raelly fight a bear--hit takes a big severe\ndog to do that. Hounds has the best noses, and they'll run a bear all\nday and night, and the next day, too; but they won't never tree--they're\nafeared to close in. Now, look at them dogs o' mine. A cur ain't got no\ndew-claws--them dogs has. My dogs can foller ary trail, same's a hound;\nbut they'll run right in on the varmint, snappin' and chawin' and\nworryin' him till he gits so mad you can hear his tushes pop half a\nmile. He cain't run away--he haster stop every bit, and fight. Finally\nhe gits so tired and het up that he trees to rest hisself. Then we-uns\nketches up and finishes him.\"\n\n\"Mebbe you-uns don't know that a dew-clawed dog is snake-proof----\"\n\nBut somebody, thinking that dog-talk had gone far enough, produced a\nbottle of soothing-syrup that was too new to have paid tax. Then we\ndiscovered that there was musical talent, of a sort, in Little John. He\ncut a pigeon-wing, twirled around with an imaginary banjo, and sang in a\nquaint minor:\n\n  Did you _ever_ see the devil,\n  With his _pitchfork_ and ladle,\n  And his _old_ iron shovel,\n  And his old gourd head?\n    O, I _will_ go to meetin',\n    And I _will_ go to meetin',\n    Yes, I _will_ go to meetin',\n    In an old tin pan.\n\n\nOther songs followed, with utter irrelevance--mere snatches from\n\"ballets\" composed, mainly, by the mountaineers themselves, though some\ndated back to a long-forgotten age when the British ancestors of these\nCarolina woodsmen were battling with lance and long-bow. It was one of\nmodern and local origin that John was singing when there came a\ndiversion from without--\n\n  La-a-ay down, boys,\n    Le's take a nap:\n  Thar's goin' to be trouble\n    In the Cumberland Gap--\n\n\nOur ears were stunned by one sudden thundering crash. The roof rose\nvisibly, as though pushed upward from within. In an instant we were\nblinded by moss and dried mud--the chinking blown from between the logs\nof our shabby cabin. Dred and Coaly cowered as though whipped, while\n\"Doc's\" little hound slunk away in the keen misery of fear. We men\nlooked at each other with lowered eyelids and the grim smile that\ndenotes readiness, though no special eagerness, for dissolution. Beyond\nthe \"gant-lot\" we could hear trees and limbs popping like skirmishers in\naction.\n\nThen that tidal wave of air swept by. The roof settled again with only a\nfew shingles missing. We went to \"redding up.\" Squalls broke against the\nmountainside, hither and yon, like the hammer of Thor testing the\nfoundations of the earth. But they were below us. Here, on top, there\nwas only the steady drive of a great surge of wind; and speech was\npossible once more.\n\n\"Fellers, you want to mark whut you dream about, to-night: hit'll shore\ncome true to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Yes: but you mustn't tell whut yer dream was till the hunt's over, or\nit'll spile the charm.\"\n\nThere ensued a grave discussion of dream-lore, in which the illiterates\nof our party declared solemn faith. If one dreamt of blood, he would\nsurely see blood the next day. Another lucky sign for a hunter was to\ndream of quarreling with a woman, for that meant a she-bear; it was\nfavorable to dream of clear water, but muddy water meant trouble.\n\nThe wind died away. When we went out for a last observation of the\nweather we found the air so clear that the lights of Knoxville were\nplainly visible, in the north-north west, thirty-two miles in an air\nline. Not another light was to be seen on earth, although in some\ndirections we could scan for nearly a hundred miles. The moon shone\nbrightly. Things looked rather favorable for the morrow, after all.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Brek-k-k-_fust_!\"\n\nI awoke to a knowledge that somebody had built a roaring fire and was\nstirring about. Between the cabin logs one looked out upon a starry sky\nand an almost pitch-dark world. What did that pottering vagabond mean by\narousing us in the middle of the night? But I was hungry. Everybody half\narose on elbows and blinked about. Then we got up, each after his\nfashion, except one scamp who resumed snoring.\n\n\"Whar's that brekfust you're yellin' about?\"\n\n\"Hit's for you-uns to help _git_! I knowed I couldn't roust ye no other\nway. Here, you, go down to the spring and fetch water. Rustle out, boys;\nwe've got to git a soon start if you want bear brains an' liver for\nsupper.\"\n\nThe \"soon start\" tickled me into good humor.\n\nOur dogs were curled together under the long bunk, having popped indoors\nas soon as the way was opened. Somebody trod on Coaly's tail. Coaly\nsnapped Dred. Instantly there was action between the four. It is\ninteresting to observe what two or three hundred pounds of dog can do to\na ramshackle berth with a man on top of it. Poles and hay and ragged\nquilts flew in every direction. Sleepy Matt went down in the midst of\nthe m\u00c3\u00aal\u00c3\u00a9e, swearing valiantly. I went out and hammered ice out of the\nwash-basin while Granville and John quelled the riot. Presently our\nfrying-pans sputtered and the huge coffee-pot began to get up steam.\n\n\"Waal, who dreamt him a good dream?\"\n\n\"I did,\" affirmed the writer. \"I dreamt that I had an old colored woman\nby the throat and was choking dollars out of her mouth----\"\n\n\"Good la!\" exclaimed four men in chorus; \"you hadn't orter a-told.\"\n\n\"Why? Wasn't that a lovely dream?\"\n\n\"Hit means a she-bear, shore as a cap-shootin' gun; but you've done\nspiled it all by tellin'. Mebbe somebody'll git her to-day, but _you_\nwon't--your chanct is ruined.\"\n\nSo the reader will understand why, in this veracious narrative, I cannot\nrelate any heroic exploits of my own in battling with Ursus Major. And\nso you, ambitious one, when you go into the Smokies after that long-lost\nbear, remember these two cardinal points of the Law:\n\n     (1) Dream that you are fighting some poor old colored woman. (That\n     is easy: the victuals you get will fix up your dream, all right.)\n     And--\n\n     (2) Keep your mouth shut about it.\n\n\nThere was still no sign of rose-color in the eastern sky when we sallied\nforth. The ground, to use a mountaineer's expression, was \"all spewed up\nwith frost.\" Rime crackled underfoot and our mustaches soon stiffened in\nthe icy wind.\n\nIt was settled that Little John Cable and the hunchback Cope should take\nthe dogs far down into Bone Valley and start the drive, leaving\nGranville, \"Doc,\" Matt, and myself to picket the mountain. I was given a\nstand about half a mile east of the cabin, and had but a vague notion of\nwhere the others went.\n\nBy jinks, it was cold! I built a little fire between the buttressing\nroots of a big mountain oak, but still my toes and fingers were numb.\nThis was the 25th of November, and we were at an altitude where\nsometimes frost forms in July. The other men were more thinly clad than\nI, and with not a stitch of wool beyond their stockings; but they seemed\nto revel in the keen air. I wasted some pity on Cope, who had no\nunderwear worthy of the name; but afterwards I learned that he would not\nhave worn more clothes if they had been given him. Many a night my\ncompanions had slept out on the mountain without blanket or shelter,\nwhen the ground froze and every twig in the forest was coated with rime\nfrom the winter fog.\n\nAway out yonder beyond the mighty bulk of Clingman Dome, which, black\nwith spruce and balsam, looked like a vast bear rising to contemplate\nthe northern world, there streaked the first faint, nebulous hint of\ndawn. Presently the big bear's head was tipped with a golden crown\nflashing against the scarlet fires of the firmament, and the earth\nawoke.\n\nA rustling some hundred yards below me gave signal that the gray\nsquirrels were on their way to water. Out of a tree overhead hopped a\nmountain \"boomer\" (red squirrel), and down he came, eyed me, and\nstopped. Cocking his head to one side he challenged peremptorily: \"Who\nare you? Stump? Stump? Not a stump. What the deuce!\"\n\nI moved my hand.\n\n\"Lawk--the booger-man! Run, run, run!\"\n\nSomewhere from the sky came a strange, half-human note, as of someone\nchiding: \"_Wal_-lace, _Wal_-lace, _Wat_!\" I could get no view for the\ntrees. Then the voice flexibly changed to a deep-toned \"Co-_logne_,\nCo-_logne_, Co-_logne_,\" that rang like a bell through the forest\naisles.\n\nTwo names uttered distinctly from the air! Two scenes conjured in a\nbreath, vivid but unrelated as in dreams: Wallace--an iron-bound\nScottish coast; Cologne--tall spires, and cliffs along the Rhine! What\nmagic had flashed such pictures upon a remote summit of the Smoky\nMountains?\n\nThe weird speaker sailed into view--a raven. Forward it swept with great\nspeed of ebon wings, fairly within gunshot for one teasing moment. Then,\nas if to mock my gaping stupor, it hurtled like a hawk far into the safe\ndistance, whence it flung back loud screams of defiance and chuckles of\nderision.\n\nAs the morning drew on, I let the fire die to ashes and basked lazily in\nthe sun. Not a sound had I heard from the dogs. My hoodoo was working\nmalignly. Well, let it work. I was comfortable now, and that old bear\ncould go to any other doom she preferred. It was pleasant enough to\nlie here alone in the forest and be free! Aye, it was good to be alive,\nand to be far, far away from the broken bottles and old tin cans of\ncivilization.\n\n\n[Illustration: \"By and by up they came, carrying the Bear on a trimmed\nsapling\"]\n\n\nFor many a league to the southward clouds covered all the valleys in\nbillows of white, from which rose a hundred mountain tops, like islands\nin a tropic ocean. My fancy sailed among and beyond them, beyond the\nhorizon's rim, even unto those far seas that I had sailed in my youth,\nto the old times and the old friends that I should never see again.\n\nBut a forenoon is long-drawn-out when one has breakfasted before dawn,\nand has nothing to do but sit motionless in the woods and watch and\nlisten. I got to fingering my rifle trigger impatiently and wishing that\na wild Thanksgiving gobbler might blunder into view. Squirrels made\nceaseless chatter all around my stand. Large hawks shrilled by me within\ntempting range, whistling like spent bullets. A groundhog sat up on a\nlog and whistled, too, after a manner of his own. He was so near that I\ncould see his nose wiggle. A skunk waddled around for twenty minutes,\nand once came so close that I thought he would nibble my boot. I was\namong old mossy beeches, scaled with polyphori, and twisted into\npostures of torture by their battles with the storms. Below, among\nchestnuts and birches, I could hear the _t-wee, t-wee_ of \"joree-birds\"\n(towhees), which winter in the valleys. Incessantly came the\n_chip-chip-cluck_ of ground squirrels, the saucy bark of the grays, and\ngreat chirruping among the \"boomers,\" which had ceased swearing and were\nhard at work.\n\nFar off on my left a rifle cracked. I pricked up and listened intently,\nbut there was never a yelp from a dog. Since it is a law of the chase to\nfire at nothing smaller than turkeys, lest big game be scared away, this\nshot might mean a gobbler. I knew that Matt Hyde could not, to save his\nsoul, sit ten minutes on a stand without calling turkeys (and he _could_\ncall them, with his unassisted mouth, better than anyone I ever heard\nperform with leaf or wing-bone or any other contrivance).\n\nThus the slow hours dragged along. I yearned mightily to stretch my\nlegs. Finally, being certain that no drive would approach my stand that\nday, I ambled back to the hut and did a turn at dinner-getting. Things\nwere smoking, and smelt good, by the time four of our men turned up, all\nof them dog-tired and disappointed, but stoical.\n\n\"That pup Coaly chased off atter a wildcat,\" blurted John. \"We held the\nold dogs together and let him rip. Then Dred started a deer. It was that\nold buck that everybody's shot at, and missed, this three year back. I'd\nbelieve he's a hant if 't wasn't for his tracks--they're the biggest I\never seen. He must weigh two hunderd and fifty. But he's a foxy cuss.\nTuk right down the bed o' Desolation, up the left prong of Roaring Fork,\nright through the Devil's Race-path (how a deer can git through thar I\ndon't see!), crossed at the Meadow Gap, went down Eagle Creek, and by\nnow he's in the Little Tennessee. That buck, shorely to God, has wings!\"\n\nWe were at table in the Carolina room when Matt Hyde appeared. Sure\nenough, he bore a turkey hen.\n\n\"I was callin' a gobbler when this fool thing showed up. I fired a shoot\nas she riz in the air, but only bruk her wing. She made off on her legs\nlike the devil whoppin' out fire. I run, an' she run. Guess I run her\nhalf a mile through all-fired thickets. She piped '_Quit--quit_,' but I\nsaid, 'I'll see you in hell afore I quit!' and the chase resumed.\nFinally I knocked her over with a birch stob, and here we are.\"\n\nMatt ruefully surveyed his almost denuded legs, evidence of his chase.\n\"Boys,\" said he, \"I'm nigh breechless!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNone but native-born mountaineers could have stood the strain of another\ndrive that day, for the country that Cope and Cable had been through was\nfearful, especially the laurel up Roaring Fork and Killpeter Ridge. But\nthe stamina of these \"withey\" little men was even more remarkable than\ntheir endurance of cold. After a small slice of fried pork, a chunk of\nhalf-baked johnny-cake, and a pint or so of coffee, they were as fresh\nas ever.\n\nWhat soldiers these fellows would make, under leadership of some\nbackwoods Napoleon who could hold them together!--some man like Daniel\nMorgan of the Revolution, who was one of them, yet greater!\n\nI had made the coffee strong, and it was good stuff that I had brought\nfrom home. After his first deep draught, Little John exclaimed:\n\n\"Hah! boys, that coffee hits whar ye hold it!\"\n\nI thought that a neat compliment from a sharpshooter.\n\nWe took new stands; but the afternoon passed without incident to those\nof us on the mountain tops. I returned to camp about five o'clock, and\nwas surprised to see three of our men lugging across the \"gant-lot\"[3]\ntoward the cabin a small female bear.\n\n\"Hyur's yer old nigger woman,\" shouted John.\n\nThe hunters showed no elation--in fact, they looked sheepish--and I\nsuspected a nigger in the woodpile.\n\n\"How's this? I didn't hear any drive.\"\n\n\"There wa'n't none.\"\n\n\"Then where did you get your bear?\"\n\n\"In one of Wit Hensley's traps, dum him! Boys, I wish t' we _hed_\nroasted the temper outen them trap-springs, like we talked o' doin'.\"\n\n\"Was the bear alive?\"\n\n\"Live as a hot coal. See the pup's head!\"\n\nI examined Coaly, who looked sick. The flesh was torn from his lower jaw\nand hung down a couple of inches. Two holes in the top of his head\nshowed where the bear's tusks had tried to crack his skull.\n\n\"When the other dogs found her, he rushed right in. She hadn't been\ntrapped more'n a few hours, and she larned Coaly somethin' about the\nbear business.\"\n\n\"Won't this spoil him for hunting hereafter?\"\n\n\"Not if he has his daddy's and mammy's grit. We'll know by to-morrow\nwhether he's a shore-enough bear dog; for I've larned now whar they're\ncrossin'--seed sign a-plenty and it's spang fraish. Coaly, old boy!\nyou-uns won't be so feisty and brigaty after this, will ye!\"\n\n\"John, what do those two words mean?\"\n\n\"_Good_ la! whar was you fotch up? Them's common. They mean nigh about\nthe same thing, only there's a differ. When I say that Doc Jones thar is\nbrigaty among women-folks, hit means that he's stuck on hisself and\nwants to show off----\"\n\n\"And John Cable's sulkin' around with his nose out o' jint,\" interjected\n\"Doc.\"\n\n\"Feisty,\" proceeded the interpreter, \"feisty means when a feller's\nallers wigglin' about, wantin' ever'body to see him, like a kid when the\npreacher comes. You know a feist is one o' them little bitty dogs that\nginerally runs on three legs and pretends a whole lot.\"\n\nAll of us were indignant at the setter of the trap. It had been hidden\nin a trail, with no sign to warn a man from stepping into it. In\nTennessee, I was told, it is a penitentiary offense to set out a bear\ntrap. We agreed that a similar law ought to be passed as soon as\npossible in North Carolina.\n\n\"It's only two years ago,\" said Granville to me, \"that Jasper\nMillington, an old man living on the Tennessee side, started acrost the\nmountain to get work at the Everett mine, where you live. Not fur from\nwhere we are now, he stepped into a bear trap that was hid in the\nleaves, like this one. It broke his leg, and he starved to death in it.\"\n\nDespite our indignation meeting, it was decided to carry the trapped\nbear's hide to Hensley, and for us to use only the meat as recompense\nfor trouble, to say nothing of risk to life and limb. Such is the\nmountaineers' regard for property rights!\n\nThe animal we had ingloriously won was undersized, weighing scant 175\npounds. The average weight of Smoky Mountain bears is not great, but\noccasionally a very large beast is killed. Matt Hyde told us that he\nkilled one on the Welch Divide in 1901, the meat of which, dressed,\nwithout the hide, weighed 434 pounds, and the hide \"squared eight feet\"\nwhen stretched for drying. \"Doc\" Jones killed a bear that was \"kivered\nwith fat, five inches thick.\"\n\nAfterwards I took pains to ask the most famous bear hunters of our\nregion what were the largest bears they had personally killed. Uncle\nJimmy Crawford, of the Balsam Mountains, estimated his largest at 500\npounds gross, and the hide of another that he had killed weighed forty\npounds after three days' drying. Quill Rose, of Eagle Creek, said that,\nafter stripping the hide from one of his bears, he took the fresh skin\nby the ears and raised it as high as he could reach above his head, and\nthat four inches of the butt end of the hide (not legs) trailed on the\nground. \"And,\" he added severely, \"thar's no lie about it.\" Quill is six\nfeet one and one-half inches tall. Black Bill Walker, of the middle\nprong of Little River (Tennessee side), told me \"The biggest one I ever\nsaw killed had a hide that measured ten feet from nose to rump,\nstretched for drying. The biggest I ever killed myself measured nine and\na half feet, same way, and weighed a good four hundred net, which,\nallowin' for hide, blood, and entrails, would run full five hunderd live\nweight.\"\n\n\n[Illustration: Skinning a frozen bear]\n\n\nWithin the past two years two bears of about 500 pounds each have been\nkilled in Swain and Graham counties, the Cables getting one of them.\nThe veteran hunters that I have named have killed their hundreds of\nbears and are men superior to silly exaggeration. In the Smoky Mountains\nthe black bear, like most of the trees, attains its fullest development,\nand that it occasionally reaches a weight of 500 pounds when \"hog fat\"\nis beyond reasonable doubt, though the average would not be more than\nhalf that weight.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe spent the evening in debate as to where the next drive should be\nmade. Some favored moving six miles eastward, to the old mining shack at\nSiler's Meadow, and trying the headwaters of Forney's Creek, around Rip\nShin Thicket and the Gunstick Laurel, driving towards Clingman Dome and\nover into the bleak gulf, southwest of the Sugarland Mountains, that I\nhad named Godforsaken--a title that stuck. We knew there were bears in\nthat region, though it was a desperately rough country to hunt in.\n\nBut John and the hunchback had found \"sign\" in the opposite direction.\nBears were crossing from Little River in the neighborhood of Thunderhead\nand Briar Knob, coming up just west of the Devil's Court House and\n\"using\" around Block House, Woolly Ridge, Bear Pen, and thereabouts.\nThe motion carried, and we adjourned to bed.\n\nWe breakfasted on bear meat, the remains of our Thanksgiving turkey, and\nwheat bread shortened with bear's grease until it was light as a\nfeather; and I made tea. It was the first time that Little John ever saw\n\"store tea.\" He swallowed some of it as if it had been boneset, under\nthe impression that it was some sort of \"yerb\" that would be good for\nhis insides. Without praising its flavor, he asked what it had cost,\nand, when I told him \"a dollar a pound,\" reckoned that it was \"rich\nman's medicine\"; said he preferred dittany or sassafras or goldenrod.\n\"Doc\" Jones opined that it \"looked yaller,\" and he even affirmed that it\n\"tasted yaller.\"\n\n\"Waal, people,\" exclaimed Matt, \"I 'low I've done growed a bit, atter\nthat mess o' meat. Le's be movin'.\"\n\nIt was a hard pull for me, climbing up the rocky approach to Briar Knob.\nThis was my first trip to the main divide, and my heart was not yet used\nto mountain climbing.\n\nThe boys were anxious for me to get a shot. I was paying them nothing;\nit was share-and-share alike; but their neighborly kindness moved them\nto do their best for the outlander.\n\nSo they put me on what was probably the best stand for the day. It was\nabove the Fire-scald, a brul\u00c3\u00a9 or burnt-over space on the steep southern\nside of the ridge between Briar Knob and Laurel Top, overlooking the\ngrisly slope of Killpeter. Here I could both see and hear an uncommonly\nlong distance, and if the bear went either east or west I would have\ntimely warning.\n\nThis Fire-scald, by the way, is a famous place for wildcats. Once in a\nblue moon a lynx is killed in the highest zone of the Smokies, up among\nthe balsams and spruces, where both the flora and fauna, as well as the\nclimate, resemble those of the Canadian woods. Our native hunters never\nheard the word lynx, but call the animal a \"catamount.\" Wolves and\npanthers used to be common here, but it is a long time since either has\nbeen killed in this region, albeit impressionable people see wolf tracks\nor hear a \"pant'er\" scream every now and then.\n\nI had shivered on the mountain top for a couple of hours, hearing only\nan occasional yelp from the dogs, which had been working in the thickets\na mile or so below me, when suddenly there burst forth the devil of a\nracket.\n\nOn came the chase, right in my direction. Presently I could distinguish\nthe different notes: the deep bellow of old Dred, the hound-like baying\nof Rock and Coaly, and little Towse's feisty yelp.\n\nI thought that the bear might chance the comparatively open space of the\nFire-scald, because there were still some ashes on the ground that would\ndust the dogs' nostrils and throw them off the scent. And such, I\nbelieve, was his intention. But the dogs caught up with him. They nipped\nhim fore and aft. Time after time he shook them off; but they were true\nbear dogs, and, like Matt Hyde after the turkey, they knew no such word\nas quit.\n\nI took a last squint at my rifle sights, made sure there was a cartridge\nin the chamber, and then felt my ears grow as I listened. Suddenly the\nchase swerved at a right angle and took straight up the side of\nSaddle-back. Either the bear would tree, or he would try to smash on\nthrough to the low rhododendron of the Devil's Court House, where dogs\nwho followed might break their legs. I girded myself and ran, \"wiggling\nand wingling\" along the main divide, and then came the steep pull up\nBriar Knob. As I was grading around the summit with all the lope that\nwas left in me, I heard a rifle crack, half a mile down Saddle-back. Old\n\"Doc\" was somewhere in that vicinity. I halted to listen. Creation,\nwhat a rumpus! Then another shot. Then the warwhoop of the South, that\nwe read about.\n\nBy and by, up they came, John and Cope and \"Doc,\" two at a time,\ncarrying the bear on a trimmed sapling. Presently Hyde joined us, then\ncame Granville, and we filed back to camp, where \"Doc\" told his story:\n\n\"Boys, them dogs' eyes shined like new money. Coaly fit agin, all right,\nand got his tail bit. The bear div down into a sink-hole with the dogs\na-top o' him. Soon's I could shoot without hittin' a dog, I let him have\nit. Thought I'd shot him through the head, but he fit on. Then I jumped\ndown into the sink and kicked him loose from the dogs, or he'd a-killed\nCoaly. Waal, sir, he wa'n't hurt a bit--the ball jest glanced off his\nhead. He riz an' knocked me down with his left paw, an' walked right\nover me, an' lit up the ridge. The dogs treed him in a minute. I went to\nshoot up at him, but my new hulls [cartridges] fit loose in this old\nchamber and this one drap [dropped] out, so the gun stuck. Had to git my\nknife out and fix hit. Then the dad-burned gun wouldn't stand roostered\n[cocked]; the feather-spring had jumped out o' place. But I held back\nwith my thumb, and killed him anyhow.\n\n\"Fellers,\" he added feelingly, \"I wish t' my legs growed\nhind-side-fust.\"\n\n\"_What_ fer?\"\n\n\"So 's 't I wouldn't bark my shins!\"\n\n\"Bears,\" remarked John, \"is all left-handed. Ever note that? Hit's the\nleft paw you wanter look out fer. He'd a-knocked somethin' out o' yer\nhead if there'd been much in it, Doc.\"\n\n\"Funny thing, but hit's true,\" declared Bill, \"that a bear allers dies\nflat on his back, onless he's trapped.\"\n\n\"So do men,\" said \"Doc\" grimly; \"men who've been shot in battle. You go\nalong a battlefield, right atter the action, and you'll find most o' the\ndead faces pintin' to the sky.\"\n\n\"Bears is almost human, anyhow. A skinned bear looks like a great\nbig-bodied man with long arms and stumpy legs.\"\n\nI did not relish this turn of the conversation, for we had two bears to\nskin immediately. The one that had been hung up over night was frozen\nsolid, so I photographed her standing on her legs, as in life. When it\ncame to skinning this beast the job was a mean one; a fellow had to drop\nout now and then to warm his fingers.\n\nThe mountaineers have an odd way of sharing the spoils of the chase.\nThey call it \"stoking the meat,\" a use of the word _stoke_ that I have\nnever heard elsewhere. The hide is sold, and the proceeds divided\nequally among the hunters, but the meat is cut up into as many pieces as\nthere are partners in the chase; then one man goes indoors or behind a\ntree, and somebody at the carcass, laying his hand on a portion, calls\nout: \"Whose piece is this?\"\n\n\"Granville Calhoun's,\" cries the hidden man, who cannot see it.\n\n\"Whose is this?\"\n\n\"Bill Cope's.\"\n\nAnd so on down the line. Everybody gets what chance determines for him,\nand there can be no charges of unfairness.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt turned very cold that night. The last thing I heard was Matt Hyde\nprotesting to the hunchback:\n\n\"Durn you, Bill Cope, you're so cussed crooked a man cain't lay cluss\nenough to you to keep warm!\"\n\nOnce when I awoke in the night the beech trees were cracking like\nrifle-shots from the intense frost.\n\nNext morning John announced that we were going to get another bear.\n\n\"Night afore last,\" he said, \"Bill dremp that he seed a lot o' fat meat\nlayin' on the table; an' it done come true. Last night I dremp me one\nthat never was knowed to fail yet. Now you see!\"\n\nIt did not look like it by evening. We all worked hard and endured\nmuch--standers as well as drivers--but not a rifle had spoken up to the\ntime when, from my far-off stand, I yearned for a hot supper.\n\nAway down in the rear I heard the snort of a locomotive, one of those\ncog-wheel affairs that are specially built for mountain climbing. With a\nsteam-loader and three camps of a hundred men each, it was despoiling\nthe Tennessee forest. Slowly, but inexorably, a leviathan was crawling\ninto the wilderness and was soon to consume it.\n\n\n[Illustration: \"....Powerful steep and Laurely....\"]\n\n\n\"All this,\" I apostrophized, \"shall be swept away, tree and plant, beast\nand fish. Fire will blacken the earth; flood will swallow and spew forth\nthe soil. The simple-hearted native men and women will scatter and\ndisappear. In their stead will come slaves speaking strange tongues, to\ntoil in the darkness under the rocks. Soot will arise, and foul gases;\nthe streams will run murky death. Let me not see it! No; I will\n\n  \"'... Get me to some far-off land\n    Where higher mountains under heaven stand ...\n    Where other thunders roll amid the hills,\n    Some mightier wind a mightier forest fills\n  With other strains through other-shapen boughs.'\"\n\n\nWearily I plodded back to camp. No one had arrived but \"Doc.\" The old\nman had been thumped rather severely in yesterday's scrimmage, but\ncomplained only of \"a touch o' rheumatiz.\" Just how this disease had\nleft his clothes in tatters he did not explain.\n\nIt was late when Matt and Granville came in. The crimson and yellow of\nsunset had turned to a faultless turquoise, and this to a violet\nafterglow; then suddenly night rose from the valleys and enveloped us.\n\nAbout nine o'clock I went out on the Little Chestnut Bald and fired\nsignals, but there was no answer. The last we had known of the drivers\nwas that they had been beyond Thunderhead, six miles of hard travel to\nthe westward. There was fog on the mountain. We did some uneasy\nspeculating. Then Granville and Matt took the lantern and set out for\nBriar Knob. \"Doc\" was too stiff for travel, and I, being at that time a\nstranger in the Smokies, would be of no use hunting amid clouds and\ndarkness. \"Doc\" and I passed a dreary three hours. Finally, at midnight,\nmy shots were answered, and soon the dogs came limping in. Dred had been\nseverely bitten in the shoulders and Rock in the head. Coaly was bloody\nabout the mouth, where his first day's wound had reopened. Then came the\nfour men, empty-handed, it seemed, until John slapped a bear's \"melt\"\n(spleen) upon the table. He limped from a bruised hip.\n\n\"That bear outsharped us and went around all o' you-uns. We follered him\nclar over to the Spencer Place, and then he doubled and come back on the\nfur side o' the ridge. He crossed through the laurel on the Devil's\nCourt House and tuk down an almighty steep place. It was plumb night by\nthat time. I fell over a rock clift twenty feet down, and if 't hadn't\nbeen for the laurel I'd a-bruk some bones. I landed right in the middle\nof them, bear and dogs, fightin' like gamecocks. The bear clim a tree.\nBill sung out 'Is it fur down thar?' and I said 'Purty fur.' 'Waal, I'm\na-comin',' says he; and with that he grabbed a laurel to swing hisself\ndown by, but the stem bruk, and down he come suddent, to jine the music.\nHit was so dark I couldn't see my gun barrel, and we wuz all tangled up\nin greenbriers as thick as ploughlines. I had to fire twiste afore he\ntumbled. Then Matt an' Granville come. The four of us tuk turn-about\ncrawlin' up out o' thar with the bear on our back. Only one man could\nhandle him at a time--and he'll go a good two hunderd, that bear. We\ngutted him, and left him near the top, to fotch in the mornin'. Fellers,\nI'm bodaciously tired out. This is the time I'd give half what I'm worth\nfor a gallon o' liquor--and I'd promise the rest!\"\n\n\"You'd orter see what Coaly did to that varmint,\" said Bill. \"He bit a\nhole under the fore leg, through hide and ha'r, clar into the holler, so\nt' you can stick your hand in and seize the bear's heart.\"\n\n\"John, what was that dream of yours?\"\n\n\"I dremp I stole a feller's overcoat. Now d'ye see? That means a bear's\nhide.\"\n\nCoaly, three days ago, had been an inconsequential pup; but now he\nlooked up into my eyes with the calm dignity that no fool or braggart\ncan assume. He had been knighted. As he licked his wounds he was proud\nof them. \"Scars of battle, sir. You may have your swagger ribbons and\nprize collars in the New York dog show, but _this_ for me!\"\n\nPoor Coaly! after two more years of valiant service, he was to meet an\nevil fortune. In connection with it I will relate a queer coincidence:\n\nTwo years after this hunt, a friend and I spent three summer months in\nthis same old cabin on top of Smoky. When Andy had to return North he\nleft with me, for sale, a .30-30 carbine, as he had more guns than he\nneeded. I showed this carbine to Quill Rose, and the old hunter said: \"I\ndon't like them power-guns; you could shoot clar through a bear and kill\nyour dog on the other side.\" The next day I sold the weapon to Granville\nCalhoun. Within a short time, word came from Granville's father that\n\"Old Reelfoot\" was despoiling his orchard. This Reelfoot was a large\nbear whose cunning had defied our best hunters for five or six years. He\ngot his name from the fact that he \"reeled\" or twisted his hind feet in\nwalking, as some horses do, leaving a peculiar track. This seems rather\ncommon among old bears, for I have known of several \"reelfoots\" in\nother, and widely separated, regions.\n\nCable and his dogs were sent for. A drive was made, and the bear was\nactually caught within a few rods of old Mr. Calhoun's stable. His teeth\nwere worn to the gums, and, as he could no longer kill hogs, he had come\ndown to an apple diet. He was large-framed, but very poor. The only\nhunters on the spot were Granville, with the .30-30, and a northern\nlumberman named Hastings, with a Luger carbine. After two or three shots\nhad wounded the bear, he rose on his hind feet and made for Granville. A\n.30-30 bullet went clear through the beast at the very instant that\nCoaly, who was unseen, jumped up on the log behind it, and the missile\ngave both animals their death wound.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nMOONSHINE LAND\n\n\nI was hunting alone in the mountains, and exploring ground that was new\nto me. About noon, while descending from a high ridge into a creek\nvalley, to get some water, I became enmeshed in a rhododendron \"slick,\"\nand, to some extent, lost my bearings.\n\nAfter floundering about for an hour or two, I suddenly came out upon a\nlittle clearing. Giant hemlocks, girdled and gaunt, rose from a steep\ncornfield of five acres, beyond which loomed the primeval forest of the\nGreat Smoky Mountains. Squat in the foreground sat one of the rudest log\nhuts I had ever seen, a tiny one-room shack, without window, cellar, or\nloft, and without a sawed board showing in its construction. A thin curl\nof smoke rose from one end of the cabin, not from a chimney, but from a\nmere semi-circle of stones piled four feet high around a hole cut\nthrough the log wall. The stones of this fireplace were not even\nplastered together with mud, nor had the builder ever intended to raise\nthe pile as high as the roof to guard his premises against the imminent\nrisk of fire. Two low doors of riven boards stood wide open, opposite\neach other. These, helped by wide crevices between the unchinked logs,\nserved to let in some sunlight, and quite too much of the raw November\nair. The surroundings were squalid and filthy beyond anything I had\nhitherto witnessed in the mountains. As I approached, wading ankle-deep\nin muck that reached to the doorsill, two pigs scampered out through the\nopposite door.\n\nWithin the hut I found only a slip of a girl, rocking a baby almost as\nbig as herself, and trying to knit a sock at the same time. She was\ntoasting her bare toes before the fire, and crooning in a weird minor\nsome mountain ditty that may have been centuries old.\n\nI shivered as I looked at this midget, comparing her only garment, a\ntorn calico dress, with my own stout hunter's garb that seemed none too\nwarm for such a day as this.\n\nKnowing that the sudden appearance of a stranger would startle the girl,\nI chose the quickest way to reassure her by saluting in the vernacular:\n\n\"Howdy?\"\n\n\"Howdy?\" she gasped.\n\n\"Who lives here?\"\n\n\"Tom Kirby.\"\n\n\"Kirby? Oh! yes, I know him--we've been hunting together. Is your father\nat home?\"\n\n\"No, he's out somewheres.\"\n\n\"Where is your mother?\"\n\n\"She's in the field, up yan, gittin' roughness.\"\n\nI took some pride in not being stumped by this answer. \"Roughness,\" in\nmountain lingo, is any kind of rough fodder, specifically corn fodder.\n\n\"How far is it to the next house?\"\n\n\"I don't know; maw, she knows.\"\n\n\"All right; I'll find her.\"\n\nI went up to the field. No one was in sight; but a shock of fodder was\nwalking away from me, and I conjectured that \"maw's\" feet were under it;\nso I hailed:\n\n\"Hello!\"\n\nThe shock turned around, then tumbled over, and there stood revealed a\nbare-headed, bare-footed woman, coarse featured but of superb\nphysique--one of those mountain giantesses who think nothing of\nshouldering a two-bushel sack of corn and carrying it a mile or two\nwithout letting it down.\n\n\n[Illustration: Moonshine Still-House Hidden in the Laurel]\n\n\nShe flushed, then paled, staring at me round-eyed--frightened, I\nthought, by this apparition of a stranger whose approach she had not\ndetected. To these people of the far backwoods everyone from outside\ntheir mountains is a doubtful character at best.\n\nHowever, Mistress Kirby quickly recovered her aplomb. Her mouth\nstraightened to a thin slit. She planted herself squarely across my\npath, now regarding me with contracted lids and a hard glint, till I\nfelt fairly bayoneted by those steel-gray eyes.\n\n\"Good-morning. Is Mr. Kirby about?\" I inquired.\n\nThere was no answer. Instead, the thin slit opened and let out a yell of\nalmost yodel quality, penetrating as a warwhoop--a yell that would carry\nnear half a mile. I wondered what she meant by this; but she did not\nenlighten me by so much as a single word. It was puzzling, not to say\ndisconcerting; but, charging it to the custom of a country that still\nwas new to me, I found my tongue again, and started to give credentials.\n\n\"My name is Kephart. I am staying at the Everett Mine on Sugar Fork----\"\n\nAnother yell that set the wild echoes flying.\n\n\"I am acquainted with your husband; we've hunted together. Perhaps he\nhas told you----\"\n\nYell number three, same pitch and vigor as before.\n\nBy this time I was quite nonplussed. I waited for her to speak; but\nnever a word did the woman deign. So there we stood and stared at each\nother in silence--I leaning on my rifle, she with red arms akimbo--till\nI grew embarrassed, half wondering, too, if the creature were demented.\n\nSuddenly a light flashed upon my groping wits. This amazon was on\npicket. Her three shrieks had been a signal to someone up the branch.\nHer attitude showed that there was no thoroughfare in that direction at\npresent. Circumstances, whatever they were, forbade explanation.\nClearly, the woman thought that I could not help seeing how matters\nstood. Not for a moment did she suspect but that her yells, her\nbelligerent attitude, and her refusal to speak, were the conventional\nway, this world over, of intimating that there was a _contretemps_. She\nconsidered that if I was what I claimed to be, an acquaintance of her\nhusband and on friendly footing, I would be gentleman enough to retire.\nIf I was something else--an officer, a spy--well, she was there to stop\nme until the captain of the guard arrived.\n\nFor one silly moment I was tempted to advance and see what this martial\nspouse would do if I tried to pass her on the trail. But a hunter's\ninstinct made me glance forward to the upper corner of the field. There\nwas thick cover beyond the fence, with a clear range of a hundred and\nfifty yards between it and me--too far for Tom to recognize me, I\nthought, but deadly range for his Winchester, I knew. One forward step\nof mine would put me in the status of an armed intruder. So I concluded\nthat common sense would better become me at this juncture than a bit of\nfooling that surely would be misinterpreted, and that might end\ningloriously.\n\n\"Ah, well!\" I remarked, \"when your husband gets back, tell him, please,\nthat I was sorry to miss him; though I did not call on any special\nbusiness--just wanted to say 'Howdy?' you know. Good day!\"\n\nI turned and went down the valley.\n\nAll the way home I speculated on this queer adventure. What was going on\n\"up yan\"?\n\nA month before, when I had started for this wildest nook of the Smokies,\na friend had intimated that I was venturing into a dubious\ndistrict--Moonshine Land. It is but frank to confess that this prospect\nwas not unpleasant. My only fear had been that I might not find any\nmoonshiners, or that, having found them, I might not succeed in winning\ntheir confidence to the extent of learning their own side of an\ninteresting story. As to how I could do this without getting tarred with\nthe same stick, I was by no means clear; but I hoped that good luck\nmight find a way. And now it seemed as if luck had indeed favored me\nwith an excuse for broaching the topic to some friendly mountaineer, so\nI could at least see how he would take it.\n\nAnd it chanced (or was it chance?) that I had no more than finished\nsupper, that evening, when a man called at my lonely cabin. He was the\none that I knew best among my scattered neighbors. I gave him a rather\nhumorous account of my reception by Madame Kirby, and asked him what he\nthought she was yelling about.\n\nThere was no answering smile on my visitor's face. He pondered in\nsilence, weighing many contingencies, it seemed, and ventured no more\nthan a helpless \"Waal, now I wonder!\"\n\nIt did not suit me to let the matter go at that; so, on a sudden\nimpulse, I fired the question point-blank at him: \"Do you suppose that\nTom is running a still up there at the head of that little cove?\"\n\nThe man's face hardened, and there came a glint into his eyes such as I\nhad noticed in Mistress Kirby's.\n\n\"Jedgmatically, I don't know.\"\n\n\"Excuse me! I don't want to know, either. But let me explain just what I\nam driving at. People up North, and in the lowlands of the South as\nwell, have a notion that there is little or nothing going on in these\nmountains except feuds and moonshining. They think that a stranger\ntraveling here alone is in danger of being potted by a bullet from\nalmost any laurel thicket that he passes, on mere suspicion that he may\nbe a revenue officer or a spy. Of course, that is nonsense;[4] but there\nis one thing that I'm as ignorant about as any novel-reader of them all.\nYou know my habits; I like to explore--I never take a guide--and when I\ncome to a place that's particularly wild and primitive, that's just the\nplace I want to peer into. Now the dubious point is this: Suppose that,\none of these days when I'm out hunting, or looking for rare plants, I\nshould stumble upon a moonshine still in full operation--what would\nhappen? What would they do?\"\n\n\"Waal, sir, I'll tell you whut they'd do. They'd fust-place ask you some\nquestions about yourself, and whut you-uns was doin' in that thar neck\no' the woods. Then they'd git you to do some triflin' work about the\nstill--feed the furnace, or stir the mash--jest so 's 't they could\nprove that you took a hand in it your own self.\"\n\n\"What good would that do?\"\n\n\"Hit would make you one o' them in the eyes of the law.\"\n\n\"I see. But, really, doesn't that seem rather childish? I could easily\nconvince any court that I did it under compulsion; for that's what it\nwould amount to.\"\n\n\"I reckon you-uns would find a United States court purty hard to\nconvince. The judge 'd right up and want to know why you let grass go to\nseed afore you came and informed on them.\"\n\nHe paused, watched my expression, and then continued quizzically: \"I\nreckon you wouldn't be in no great hurry to do _that_.\"\n\n\"No! Then, if I stirred the mash and sampled their liquor, nobody would\nbe likely to mistreat me?\"\n\n\"Shucks! Why, man, whut could they gain by hurtin' you? At the wust,\ns'posin' they was convicted by your own evidence, they'd only git a\nmonth or two in the pen. So why should they murder you and get hung for\nit? Hit's all 'tarnal foolishness, the notions some folks has!\"\n\n\"I thought so. Now, here! the public has been fed all sorts of nonsense\nabout this moonshining business. I'd like to learn the plain truth about\nit, without bias one way or the other. I have no curiosity about\npersonal affairs, and don't want to learn incriminating details; but I\nwould like to know how the business is conducted, and especially how it\nis regarded from the mountain people's own point of view. I have already\nlearned that a stranger's life and property are safer here than they\nwould be on the streets of Chicago or of St. Louis. It will do your\ncountry good to have that known. But I can't say that there is no\nmoonshining going on here; for a man with a wooden nose could smell it.\nNow what is your excuse for defying the law? You don't seem ashamed of\nit.\"\n\nThe man's face turned an angry red.\n\n\"Mister, we-uns hain't no call to be ashamed of ourselves, nor of ary\nthing we do. We're poor; but we don't ax no favors. We stay 'way up hyar\nin these coves, and mind our own business. When a stranger comes along,\nhe's welcome to the best we've got, such as 'tis; but if he imposes on\nus, he gits his medicine purty damned quick!\"\n\n\"And you think the Government tax on whiskey is an imposition.\"\n\n\"Hit is, under some sarcumstances.\"\n\nMy guest stretched his legs, and \"jedgmatically\" proceeded to enlighten\nme.\n\n\"Thar's plenty o' men and women grown, in these mountains, who don't\nknow that the Government is ary thing but a president in a biled shirt\nwho commands two-three judges and a gang o' revenue officers. They know\nthar's a president, because the men folks's voted for him, and the women\nfolks's seed his pictur. They've heered tell about the judges; and\nthey've seed the revenuers in flesh and blood. They believe in\nsupportin' the Government, because hit's the law. Nobody refuses to pay\nhis taxes, for taxes is fair and squar'. Taxes cost mebbe three cents on\nthe dollar; and that's all right. But revenue costs a dollar and ten\ncents on twenty cents' worth o' liquor; and that's robbin' the people\nwith a gun to their faces.\n\n\"Of course, I ain't so ignorant as all that--I've traveled about the\ncountry, been to Asheville wunst, and to Waynesville a heap o'\ntimes--and I know the theory. Theory says 't revenue is a tax on luxury.\nWaal, that's all right--anything in reason. The big fellers that\nmakes lots of money out o' stillin', and lives in luxury, ought to pay\nhandsome for it. But who ever seen luxury cavortin' around in these\nSmoky Mountains?\"\n\n\n[Illustration: MOONSHINE MILL--SIDE VIEW\n\nThe trails that lead hither are blind and rough. Behind the mill rises\nan almost precipitous mountain-side. Much of the corn is brought in on\nmen's backs at the dead of night.]\n\n\nHe paused for a reply. Even then, with my limited experience in the\nmountains, I could not help wincing at the idea. Often, in later times,\nthis man's question came back to me with peculiar force. Luxury! in a\nland where the little stores were often out of coffee, sugar, kerosene,\nand even salt; where, in dead of winter, there was no meal, much less\nflour, to be had for love or money. Luxury! where I had to live on\nbear-meat (tough old sow bear) for six weeks, because the only side of\npork that I could find for sale was full of maggots.\n\nMy friend continued: \"Whiskey means more to us mountain folks than hit\ndoes to folks in town, whar thar's drug-stores and doctors. Let ary\nthing go wrong in the fam'ly--fever, or snake bite, or somethin'--and we\ncan't git a doctor up hyar less'n three days; and it costs scand'lous.\nThe only medicines we-uns has is yerbs, which customarily ain't no good\n'thout a leetle grain o' whiskey. Now, th'r ain't no saloons allowed in\nall these western counties. The nighest State dispensary, even, is sixty\nmiles away.[5] The law wunt let us have liquor shipped to us from\nanywhars in the State. If we git it sent to us from outside the State it\nhas to come by express--and reg-lar old pop-skull it is, too. So, to be\ngood law-abiding citizens, we-uns must travel back and forth at a heap\nof expense, or pay express rates on pizened liquor--and we are too\ndurned poor to do ary one or t'other.\n\n\"Now, yan's my field o' corn. I gather the corn, and shuck hit and grind\nhit my own self, and the woman she bakes us a pone o' bread to eat--and\nI don't pay no tax, do I? Then why can't I make some o' my corn into\npure whiskey to drink, without payin' tax? I tell you, _'taint fair_,\nthis way the Government does! But, when all's said and done, the main\nreason for this 'moonshining,' as you-uns calls it, is bad roads.\"\n\n\"Bad roads?\" I exclaimed. \"What the----\"\n\n\"Jest thisaway: From hyar to the railroad is seventeen miles, with two\nmountains to cross; and you've seed that road! I recollect you-uns said\nevery one o' them miles was a thousand rods long. Nobody's ever measured\nthem, except by mountain man's foot-rule--big feet, and a long stride\nbetween 'em. Seven hundred pounds is all the load a good team can haul\nover that road, when the weather's good. Hit takes three days to make\nthe round trip, less'n you break an axle, and then hit takes four. When\nyou do git to the railroad, th'r ain't no town of a thousand people\nwithin fifty mile. Now us folks ain't even got wagons. Thar's only one\nsarviceable wagon in this whole settlement, and you can't hire it\nwithout team and driver, which is two dollars and a half a day. Whar one\no' our leetle sleds can't go, we haffter pack on mule-back or tussle it\non our own wethers. Look, then! The only farm produce we-uns can sell is\ncorn. You see for yourself that corn can't be shipped outen hyar. We can\ntrade hit for store credit--that's all. Corn _juice_ is about all we can\ntote around over the country and git cash money for. Why, man, that's\nthe only way some folks has o' payin' their taxes!\"\n\n\"But, aside from the work and the worry,\" I remarked, \"there is the\ndanger of being shot, in this business.\"\n\n\"Oh, we-uns don't lay _that_ up agin the Government! Hit's as fair for\none as 'tis for t'other. When a revenuer comes sneakin' around, why,\nwhut he gits, or whut we-uns gits, that's a 'fortune of war,' as the old\nsayin' is.\"\n\nThere is no telegraph, wired or wireless, in the mountains, but there is\nan efficient substitute. It seemed as though, in one night, the news\ntraveled from valley to cove, and from cove to nook, that I was\ninvestigating the moonshining business, and that I was apparently\n\"safe.\" Each individual interpreted that word to suit himself. Some\nregarded me askance, others were so confiding that their very frankness\nthreatened at times to become embarrassing.\n\nThereafter I had many talks and adventures with men who, at one time or\nother, had been engaged in the moonshining industry. Some of these men\nhad known the inside of the penitentiary; some were not without\nblood-guilt. I doubt not that more than one of them could, even now,\nfind his way through night and fog and laurel thicket to some \"beautiful\npiece of copper\" that has not yet been punched full of holes. They knew\nthat I was on friendly terms with revenue agents. What was worse, they\nknew that I was a scribbler. More than once I took notes in their\npresence while interviewing them, and we had the frankest understanding\nas to what would become of those notes.\n\nMy immunity was not due to any promises made or hostages given, for\nthere were none. I did not even pose as an apologist, but merely\nvolunteered to give a fair report of what I heard and saw. They took me\nat my word. Had I used such representations as a mask and secretly\nplayed the spy or informer--well, I would have deserved whatever might\nhave befallen me. As it was, I never met with any but respectful\ntreatment from these gentry, nor, to the best of my belief, did they\never tell me a lie.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nWAYS THAT ARE DARK\n\n\nOur terms moonshiner and moonshining are not used in the mountains. Here\nan illicit distiller is called a blockader, his business is blockading,\nand the product is blockade liquor. Just as the smugglers of old Britain\ncalled themselves free-traders, thereby proclaiming that they risked and\nfought for a principle, so the moonshiner considers himself simply a\nblockade-runner dealing in contraband. His offense is only _malum\nprohibitum_, not _malum in se_.\n\nThere are two kinds of blockaders, big and little. The big blockader\nmakes unlicensed whiskey on a fairly large scale. He may have several\nstills, operating alternately in different places, so as to avert\nsuspicion. In any case, the still is large and the output is quite\nprofitable. The owner himself may not actively engage in the work, but\nmay furnish the capital and hire confederates to do the distilling for\nhim, so that personally he shuns the appearance of evil. These big\nfellows are rare. They are the ones who seek collusion with the\nsmall-fry of Government officialdom, or, failing in that, instruct their\nminions to \"kill on sight.\"\n\nThe little moonshiner is a more interesting character, if for no other\nreason than that he fights fair, according to his code, and\nsingle-handed against tremendous odds. He is innocent of graft. There is\nnothing between him and the whole power of the Federal Government,\nexcept his own wits and a well-worn Winchester or muzzleloader. He is\nvery poor; he is very ignorant; he has no friends at court; his\napparatus is crude in the extreme, and his output is miserably small.\nThis man is usually a good enough citizen in other ways, of decent\nstanding in his own community, and a right good fellow toward all the\nworld, save revenue officers. Although a criminal in the eyes of the\nlaw, he is soundly convinced that the law is unjust, and that he is only\nexercising his natural rights. Such a man, as President Frost has\npointed out, suffers none of the moral degradation that comes from\nviolating his conscience; his self-respect is whole.\n\nIn describing the process of making whiskey in the mountain stills, I\nshall confine myself to the operations of the little moonshiner,\nbecause they illustrate the surprising shiftiness of our backwoodsmen.\nEvery man in the big woods is a jack-of-all-trades. His skill in\nextemporizing utensils, and even crude machines, out of the trees that\ngrow around him, is of no mean order. As good cider as ever I drank was\nmade in a hollowed log fitted with a press-block and operated by a\nhandspike. It took but half a day's work to make this cider press, and\nthe only tools used in its construction were an ax, a mattock in lieu of\nadze, an auger, and a jackknife.\n\nIt takes two or three men to run a still. It is possible for one man to\ndo the work, on so small a scale as is usually practiced, but it would\nbe a hard task for him; then, too, there are few mountaineers who could\nindividually furnish the capital, small though it be. So three men, let\nus say, will \"chip in\" five or ten dollars apiece, and purchase a\nsecond-hand still, if such is procurable, otherwise a new one, and that\nis all the apparatus they have to pay money for. If they should be too\npoor even to go to this expense, they will make a retort by inverting a\nhalf-barrel or an old wooden churn over a soap-kettle, and then all they\nhave to buy is a piece of copper tubing for the worm.\n\n\n[Illustration: Moonshine Still in Full Operation]\n\n\nIn choosing a location for their clandestine work, the first\nessential is running water. This can be found in almost any gulch; yet,\nout of a hundred known spring-branches, only one or two may be suitable\nfor the business, most of them being too public. In a country where\ncattle and hogs run wild, and where a good part of every farmer's time\nis taken in keeping track of his stock, there is no place so secret but\nthat it is liable to be visited at any time, even though it be in the\ndepths of the great forest, several miles from any human habitation.\nMoreover, cattle, and especially hogs, are passionately fond of\nstill-slop, and can scent it a great distance, so that no still can long\nremain unknown to them.[6] Consequently the still must be placed several\nmiles away from the residence of anyone who might be liable to turn\ninformer. Although nearly all the mountain people are indulgent in the\nmatter of blockading, yet personal rivalries and family jealousies are\nrife among them, and it is not uncommon for them to inform against\ntheir enemies in the neighborhood.\n\nOf course, it would not do to set up a still near a common trail--at\nleast in the far-back settlements. Our mountaineers habitually notice\nevery track they pass, whether of beast or man, and \"read the sign\" with\nIndian-like facility. Often one of my companions would stop, as though\nshot, and point with his toe to the fresh imprint of a human foot in the\ndust or mud of a public road, exclaiming: \"Now, I wonder who _that_\nfeller was! 'Twa'n't (so-and-so), for he hain't got no squar'-headed\nbob-nails; 'twa'n't (such-a-one), 'cause he wouldn't be hyar at this\ntime o' day\"; and so he would go on, figuring by a process of\nelimination that is extremely cunning, until some such conclusion as\nthis was reached, \"That's some stranger goin' over to Little River\n[across the line in Tennessee], and he's footin' hit as if the devil was\natter him--I'll bet he's stobbed somebody and is runnin' from the\nsheriff!\" Nor is the incident closed with that; our mountaineer will\ninquire of neighbors and passersby until he gets a description of the\nwayfarer, and then he will pass the word along.\n\nSome little side-branch is chosen that runs through a gully so choked\nwith laurel and briers and rhododendron as to be quite impassable, save\nby such worming and crawling as must make a great noise. Doubtless a\nfaint cattle-trail follows the backbone of the ridge above it, and this\nis the workers' ordinary highway in going to and fro; but the descent\nfrom ridge to gully is seldom made twice over the same course, lest a\ntrail be printed direct to the still-house.\n\nThis house is sometimes inclosed with logs, but oftener it is no more\nthan a shed, built low, so as to be well screened by the undergrowth. A\ngreat hemlock tree may be felled in such position as to help the\nmasking, so long as its top stays green, which will be about a year.\nBack far enough from the still-house to remain in dark shadow when the\nfurnace is going, there is built a sort of nest for the workmen, barely\nhigh enough to sit up in, roofed with bark and thatched all over with\nbrowse. Here many a dismal hour of night is passed when there is nothing\nto do but to wait on the \"cooking.\" Now and then a man crawls on all\nfours to the furnace and pitches in a few billets of wood, keeping low\nat the time, so as to offer as small a target as possible in the flare\nof the fire. Such precaution is especially needed when the number of\nconfederates is too small for efficient picketing. Around the little\nplot where the still-shed and lair are hidden, laurel may be cut in such\nway as to make a _cheval-de-frise_, sharp stubs being entangled with\nbranches, so that a quick charge through them would be out of the\nquestion. Two or three days' work, at most, will build the still-house\nand equip it ready for business, without so much as a shingle being\nbrought from outside.\n\nAfter the blockaders have established their still, the next thing is to\nmake arrangements with some miller who will jeopardize himself by\ngrinding the sprouted corn; for be it known that corn which has been\nforced to sprout is a prime essential in the making of moonshine\nwhiskey, and that the unlicensed grinding of such corn is an offense\nagainst the law of the United States no less than its distillation. Now,\nto any one living in a well-settled country, where there is, perhaps,\nonly one mill to every hundred farms, and it is visited daily by men\nfrom all over the township, the finding of an accessory in the person of\na miller would seem a most hopeless project. But when you travel in our\nsouthern mountains, one of the first things that will strike you is that\nabout every fourth or fifth farmer has a tiny tub-mill of his own. Tiny\nis indeed the word, for there are few of these mills that can grind\nmore than a bushel or two of corn in a day; some have a capacity of only\nhalf a bushel in ten hours of steady grinding. Red grains of corn being\nharder than white ones, it is a humorous saying in the mountains that \"a\nred grain in the gryste [grist] will stop the mill.\" The appurtenances\nof such a mill, even to the very buhr-stones themselves, are fashioned\non the spot. How primitive such a meal-grinder may be is shown by the\nfact that a neighbor of mine recently offered a new mill, complete, for\nsale at six dollars. A few nails, and a country-made iron rynd and\nspindle, were the only things in it that he had not made himself, from\nthe raw materials.\n\nIn making spirits from corn, the first step is to convert the starch of\nthe grain into sugar. Regular distillers do this in a few hours by using\nmalt, but at the little blockade still a slower process is used, for\nmalt is hard to get. The unground corn is placed in a vessel that has a\nsmall hole in the bottom, warm water is poured over the corn and a hot\ncloth is placed over the top. As water percolates out through the hole,\nthe vessel is replenished with more of the warm fluid. This is continued\nfor two or three days and nights until the corn has put forth sprouts a\ncouple of inches long. The diastase in the germinating seeds has the\nsame chemical effect as malt--the starch is changed to sugar.\n\nThe sprouted corn is then dried and ground into meal. This sweet meal is\nthen made into a mush with boiling water, and is let stand two or three\ndays. The \"sweet mash\" thus made is then broken up, and a little rye\nmalt, similarly prepared in the meantime, is added to it, if rye is\nprocurable. Fermentation begins at once. In large distilleries, yeast is\nadded to hasten fermentation, and the mash can then be used in three or\nfour days; the blockader, however, having no yeast, must let his mash stand\nfor eight or ten days, keeping it all that time at a proper temperature\nfor fermentation. This requires not only constant attention, but some\nskill as well, for there is no thermometer nor saccharometer in our\nmountain still-house. When done, the sugar of what is now \"sour mash\"\nhas been converted into carbonic acid and alcohol. The resulting liquid\nis technically called the \"wash,\" but blockaders call it \"beer.\" It is\nintoxicating, of course, but \"sour enough to make a pig squeal.\"\n\nThis beer is then placed in the still, a vessel with a closed head,\nconnected with a spiral tube, the worm. The latter is surrounded by a\nclosed jacket through which cold water is constantly passing. A wood\nfire is built in the rude furnace under the still; the spirit rises in\nvapor, along with more or less steam; these vapors are condensed in the\ncold worm and trickle down into the receiver. The product of this first\ndistillation (the \"low wines\" of the trade, the \"singlings\" of the\nblockader) is a weak and impure liquid, which must be redistilled at a\nlower temperature to rid it of water and rank oils.\n\nIn moonshiners' parlance, the liquor of second distillation is called\nthe \"doublings.\" It is in watching and testing the doublings that an\naccomplished blockader shows his skill, for if distillation be not\ncarried far enough, the resulting spirits will be rank, though weak, and\nif carried too far, nothing but pure alcohol will result. Regular\ndistillers are assisted at this stage by scientific instruments by which\nthe \"proof\" is tested; but the maker of \"mountain dew\" has no other\ninstrument than a small vial, and his testing is done entirely by the\n\"bead\" of the liquor, the little iridescent bubbles that rise when the\nvial is tilted. When a mountain man is shown any brand of whiskey,\nwhether a regular distillery product or not, he invariably tilts the\nbottle and levels it again, before tasting; if the bead rises and is\npersistent, well and good; if not, he is prepared to condemn the liquor\nat once.\n\nIt is possible to make an inferior whiskey at one distillation, by\nrunning the singlings through a steam-chest, commonly known as a\n\"thumpin'-chist.\" The advantage claimed is that \"Hit allows you to make\nyour whiskey afore the revenue gits it; that's all.\"\n\nThe final process is to run the liquor through a rude charcoal filter,\nto rid it of most of its fusel oil. This having been done, we have\nmoonshine whiskey, uncolored, limpid as water, and ready for _immediate\nconsumption_.\n\nI fancy that some gentlemen will stare at the words here italicised; but\nI am stating facts.\n\nIt is quite impracticable for a blockader to age his whiskey. In the\nfirst place, he is too poor to wait; in the second place, his product is\nvery small, and the local demand is urgent; in the third place, he has\nenough trouble to conceal, or run away with, a mere copper still, to say\nnothing of barrels of stored whiskey. Cheerfully he might \"waive the\nquantum o' the sin,\" but he is quite alive to \"the hazard o'\nconcealin'.\" So, while the stuff is yet warm from the still, it is taken\nby confederates and quickly disposed of. There is no exaggeration in the\nanswer a moonshiner once made to me when I asked him how old the best\nblockade liquor ever got to be: \"If it 'd git to be a month old, it 'd\nfool me!\"\n\n\n[Illustration: Photo by F. B. Laney\n\nCornmill and Blacksmith Forge]\n\n\nThey tell a story on a whilom neighbor of mine, the redoubtable Quill\nRose, which, to those who know him, sounds like one of his own: \"A\nslick-faced dude from Knoxville,\" said Quill, \"told me once that all\ngood red-liquor was aged, and that if I'd age my blockade it would bring\na fancy price. Well, sir, I tried it; I kept some for three months--and,\nby godlings, _it aint so_.\"\n\nAs for purity, all of the moonshine whiskey used to be pure, and much of\nit still is; but every blockader knows how to adulterate, and when one\nof them does stoop to such tricks he will stop at no halfway measures.\nSome add washing lye, both to increase the yield and to give the liquor\nan artificial bead, then prime this abominable fluid with pepper,\nginger, tobacco, or anything else that will make it sting. Even\nbuckeyes, which are poisonous themselves, are sometimes used to give the\ndrink a soapy bead. Such decoctions are known in the mountains by the\nexpressive terms \"pop-skull,\" \"bust head,\" \"bumblings\" (\"they make a\nbumbly noise in a feller's head\"). Some of them are so toxic that their\ncontinued use might be fatal to the drinker. A few drams may turn a\nnormally good-hearted fellow into a raging fiend who will shoot or stab\nwithout provocation.\n\nAs a rule, the mountain people have no compunctions about drinking,\ntheir ideas on this, as on other matters of conduct, being those current\neverywhere in the eighteenth century. Men, women and children drink\nwhiskey in family concert. I have seen undiluted spirits drunk, a\nspoonful at a time, by a babe that was still at the breast, and she\nnever batted an eye (when I protested that raw whiskey would ruin the\ninfant's stomach, the mother replied, with widened eyes: \"Why, if\nthere's liquor about, and she don't git none, _she jist raars_!\"). In\nspite of this, taking the mountain people by and large, they are an\nabstemious race. In drinking, as in everything else, this is the Land of\nDo Without. Comparatively few highlanders see liquor oftener than once\nor twice a month. The lumberjacks and townspeople get most of the\noutput; for they can pay the price.\n\nBlockade whiskey, until recently, sold to the consumer at from $2.50 to\n$3.00 a gallon. The average yield is only two gallons to the bushel of\ncorn. Two and a half gallons is all that can be got out of a bushel by\nblockaders' methods, even with the aid of a \"thumpin'-chist,\" unless\nlye be added. With corn selling at seventy-five cents to a dollar a\nbushel, as it did in our settlement, and taking into account that the\naverage sales of a little moonshiner's still probably did not exceed a\ngallon a day, and that a bootlegger must be rewarded liberally for\nmarketing the stuff, it will be seen that there was no fortune in this\nmysterious trade, before prohibition raised the price. Let me give you a\npicture in a few words.--\n\nHere in the laurel-thicketed forest, miles from any wagon road, is a\nlittle still, without so much as a roof over it. Hard by is a little\nmill. There is not a sawed board in that mill--even the hopper is made\nof clapboards riven on the spot.\n\nThree or four men, haggard from sleepless vigils, strike out into\npathless forest through driving rain. Within five minutes the wet\nunderbrush has drenched them to the skin. They climb, climb, climb.\nThere is no trail for a long way; then they reach a faint one that\nwinds, winds, climbs, climbs. Hour after hour the men climb. Then they\nbegin to descend.\n\nThey have crossed the divide, a mile above sea-level, and are in another\nState. Hour after hour they \"climb down,\" as they would say. They visit\nfarmers' homes at dead of night. Each man shoulders two bushels of\nshelled corn and starts back again over the highest mountain range in\neastern America. It is twenty miles to the little mill. They carry the\ncorn thither on their own backs. They sprout it, grind it, distill it.\nTwo of them then carry the whiskey twenty miles in the opposite\ndirection, and, at the risk of capture and imprisonment, or of death if\nthey resist, peddle it out by dodging, secret methods.\n\nThis is no fancy sketch; it is literal truth. It is no story of the\nolden time, but of our own day. Do you wonder that one of these men\nshould say, with a sigh--should say this? \"Blockadin' is the hardest\nwork a man ever done. And hit's wearin' on a feller's narves. Fust\nchance I git, I'm a-goin' ter quit!\"\n\nAnd it is a fact that nine out of ten of those who try the moonshining\ngame do quit before long, of their own accord.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOne day there came a ripple of excitement in our settlement. A blockader\nhad shot at Jack Coburn, and a posse had arrested the would-be\nassassin--so flew the rumor, and it proved to be true.\n\nCoburn was a northern man who, years ago, opened a little store on the\nedge of the wilderness, bought timber land, and finally rose to\naffluence. With ready wit he adapted himself to the ways of the\nmountaineers and gained ascendancy among them. Once in a while an\nemergency would arise in which it was necessary either to fight or to\nback down, and in these contests a certain art that Jack had acquired in\nMichigan lumber camps proved the undoing of more than one mountain\ntough, at the same time winning the respect of the spectators. He was\nwhat a mountaineer described to me as \"a practiced knocker.\" This\nphrase, far from meaning what it would on the Bowery, was interpreted to\nme as denoting \"a master hand in a knock-fight.\" Pugilism, as\ndistinguished from shooting or stabbing, was an unknown art in the\nmountains until Jack introduced it.\n\nCoburn had several tenants, among whom was a character whom we will call\nEdwards. In leasing a farm to Edwards, Jack had expressly stipulated\nthat there was to be no moonshining on the premises. But, by and by,\nthere was reason to suspect that Edwards was violating this part of the\ncontract. Coburn did not send for a revenue officer; he merely set forth\non a little still-hunt of his own. Before starting, he picked up a\nrevolver and was about to stick it in his pocket, but, on second\nthought, he concluded that no red-headed man should be trusted with a\nloaded gun, even in such a case as this; so he thrust the weapon back\ninto its drawer, and strode away, with nothing but his two big fists to\nenforce a seizure.\n\nCoburn searched long and diligently, but could find no sign of a still.\nFinally, when he was about to give it up, his curiosity was aroused by\nthe particularly dense browse in the top of an enormous hemlock that had\nrecently been felled. Pushing his way forward, he discovered a neat\nlittle copper still installed in the treetop itself. He picked up the\ncontraband utensil, and marched away with it.\n\nMeantime, Edwards had not been asleep. When Jack came in sight of the\nfarmhouse, humped under his bulky burden, the enraged moonshiner seized\na shotgun and ran toward him, breathing death and destruction. Jack,\nhowever, trudged along about his business. Edwards, seeing that no bluff\nwould work, fired; but the range was too great for his birdshot even to\npepper holes through the copper still.\n\nEdwards made a mistake in firing that shot. It did not hurt Coburn's\nskin, but it ruffled his dignity. In this case it was out of the\nquestion to pommel the blackguard, for he had swiftly reloaded his gun.\nSo Jack ran off with the still, carried it home, sought out our\nmagistrate, Brooks, and forthwith swore out a warrant.\n\nBrooks did not fuss over any law books. Moonshining in itself may be\nonly a peccadillo, a venial sin--let the Government skin its own\nskunks--but when a man has promised not to moonshine, and then goes and\ndoes it, why that, by Jeremy, is a breach of contract! Straightway the\nmagistrate hastened to the post-office, and swore in, as a posse\ncomitatus, the first four men that he met.\n\nNow, when four men are picked up at random in our township, it is safe\nto assume that at least three of them have been moonshiners themselves,\nand know how this sort of thing should be done. At any rate, the posse\nwasted no time in discussion. They went straight after that malefactor,\ngot him, and, within an hour after the shot was fired, he was drummed\nout of the county for good and forever.\n\nBut Edwards had a son who was a trifle brash. This son armed himself,\nand offered show of battle. He fired two or three shots with his\nWinchester (wisely over the posse's heads) and then took to the tall\ntimber. Dodging from tree to tree he led the impromptu officers such a\ndance up the mountainside that by the time they had corralled him they\nwere \"plumb overhet.\"\n\nThey set that impetuous young man on a sharp-spined little jackass,\nstrapped his feet under the animal's belly, and their chief (my hunting\npartner, he was) drove him, that same night, twenty-five miles over a\nhorrible mountain trail, and lodged him in the county jail, on a charge\nmore serious than that of moonshining.\n\nIn due time, a United States deputy arrived in our midst, bearing a\nfunny-looking hatchet with a pick at one end, which he called a \"devil.\"\nWith the pick end of this instrument he punched numerous holes through\nthe offending copper vessel, until the still looked somewhat like a\ngigantic horseradish-grater turned inside out. Then he straightened out\nthe worm by ramming a long stick through it, and triumphantly carried\naway with him the copper-sheathed staff, as legal proof, trophy, and\nburgeon of office.\n\nThe sorry old still itself reposes to this day in old Brooks's backyard,\nwhere it is regarded by passersby as an emblem, not so much of Federal\nomnipotence, as of local efficiency in administering the law with\npromptitude, and without a pennyworth of cost to anybody, save to the\noffender.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nA LEAF FROM THE PAST\n\n\nIn the United States, moonshining is seldom practiced outside the\nmountains and foothills of the southern Appalachians, and those parts of\nthe southwest (namely, in southern Missouri, Arkansas and Texas), into\nwhich the mountaineers have immigrated in considerable numbers.\n\nHere, then, is a conundrum: How does it happen that moonshining is\ndistinctly a foible of the southern mountaineer?\n\nTo get to the truth, we must hark back into that eighteenth century\nwherein, as I have already remarked, our mountain people are lingering\nto this day. We must leave the South; going, first, to Ireland of 150 or\n175 years ago, and then to western Pennsylvania shortly after the\nRevolution.\n\nThe people of Great Britain, irrespective of race, have always been\nardent haters of excise laws. As Blackstone has curtly said, \"From its\noriginal to the present time, the very name of excise has been odious\nto the people of England.\" Dr. Johnson, in his dictionary, defined\nexcise as \"A hateful tax levied upon commodities, and adjudged not by\nthe common judges of property, but by wretches hired by those to whom\nexcise is paid.\" In 1659, when the town of Edinburgh placed an\nadditional impost on ale, the Convenanter Nicoll proclaimed it an act so\nimpious that immediately \"God frae the heavens declared his anger by\nsending thunder and unheard tempests and storms.\" And we still recall\nBurns' fiery invective:\n\n    Thae curst horse-leeches o' the Excise\n    Wha mak the whisky stills their prize!\n  Haud up thy han', Deil! ance, twice, thrice!\n      There, seize the blinkers! [wretches]\n  An bake them up in brunstane pies\n      For poor d--n'd drinkers.\n\n\nPerhaps the chief reason, in England, for this outspoken detestation of\nthe exciseman lay in the fact that the law empowered him to enter\nprivate houses and to search at his own discretion. In Scotland and\nIreland there was another objection, even more valid in the eyes of the\ncommon people; excise struck heaviest at their national drink.\nEnglishmen, at the time of which we are speaking, were content with\ntheir ale, not yet having contracted the habit of drinking gin; but\nScotchmen and Irishmen preferred distilled spirits, manufactured, as a\nrule, out of their own barley, in small pot-stills (_poteen_ means,\nliterally, a little pot), the process being a common household art\nfrequently practiced \"every man for himself and his neighbor.\" A tax,\nthen, upon whiskey was as odious as a tax upon bread baked on the\ndomestic hearth--if not, indeed, more so.\n\nNow, there came a time when the taxes laid upon spirituous liquors had\nincreased almost to the point of prohibition. This was done, not so much\nfor the sake of revenue, as for the sake of the public health and\nmorals. Englishmen had suddenly taken to drinking gin, and the immediate\neffect was similar to that of introducing firewater among a race of\nsavages. There was hue and cry (apparently with good reason), that the\ngin habit, spreading like a plague, among a people unused to strong\nliquors, would soon exterminate the English race. Parliament, alarmed at\nthe outlook, then passed an excise law of extreme severity. As always\nhappens in such cases, the law promptly defeated its own purpose by\nbreeding a spirit of defiance and resistance among the great body of the\npeople.\n\nThe heavier the tax, the more widespread became the custom of illicit\ndistilling. The law was evaded in two different ways, the method\ndepending somewhat upon the relative loyalty of the people toward the\nCrown, and somewhat upon the character of the country, as to whether it\nwas thickly or thinly settled.\n\nIn rich and populous districts, as around London and Edinburgh and\nDublin, the common practice was to bribe government officials. A\nhistorian of that time declares that \"Not infrequently the gauger could\nhave laid his hands upon a dozen stills within as many hours; but he had\ncogent reasons for avoiding discoveries unless absolutely forced to make\nthem. Where informations were laid, it was by no means uncommon for a\ntrusty messenger to be dispatched from the residence of the gauger to\ngive due notice, so that by daybreak next morning 'the boys,' with all\ntheir utensils, might disappear. Now and then they were required to\nleave an old and worn-out still in place of that which they were to\nremove, so that a report of actual seizure might be made. A good\nunderstanding was thus often kept up between the gaugers and the\ndistillers; the former not infrequently received a 'duty' upon every\nstill within his jurisdiction, and his cellars were never without 'a sup\nof the best.'... The commerce was carried on to a very great extent,\nand openly. Poteen was usually preferred, even by the gentry, to\n'Parliament' or 'King's' whiskey. It was known to be free from\nadulteration, and had a smoky flavor (arising from the peat fires) which\nmany liked.\" Another writer says that \"The amount of spirits produced by\ndistillation avowedly illicit vastly exceeded that produced by the\nlicensed distilleries. According to Wakefield, stills were erected even\nin the kitchens of baronets and in the stables of clergymen.\"\n\nHowever, this sort of thing was not moonshining. It was only the\nbeginning of that system of wholesale collusion which, in later times,\nwas perfected in our own country by the \"Whiskey Ring.\"\n\nMoonshining proper was confined to the poorer class of people,\nespecially in Ireland, who lived in wild and sparsely settled regions,\nwho were governed by a clan feeling stronger than their loyalty to the\ncentral Government, and who either could not afford to share their\nprofits with the gaugers, or disdained to do so. Such people hid their\nlittle pot-stills in inaccessible places, as in the savage mountains and\nglens of Connemara, where it was impossible, or at least hazardous, for\nthe law to reach them. With arms in hand they defied the officers. \"The\nhatred of the people toward the gauger was for a very long period\nintense. The very name invariably aroused the worst passions. To kill a\ngauger was considered anything but a crime; wherever it could be done\nwith comparative safety, he was hunted to the death.\"\n\nThus we see that the townsman's weapon against the government was graft,\nand the mountaineer's weapon was his gun--a hundred and fifty years ago,\nin Ireland, as they are in America to-day. Whether racial character had\nmuch to do with this is a debatable question. But, having spoken of\nrace, a new factor, and a curious one, steps into our story. Let it be\nnoted closely, for it bears directly on a problem that has puzzled many\nof our own people, namely: What was the origin of our southern\nmountaineers?\n\nThe north of Ireland, at the time of which we have been speaking, was\nnot settled by Irishmen, but by Scotchmen, who had been imported by\nJames I. to take the place of native Hibernians whom he had dispossessed\nfrom the three northern counties. These immigrants came to be known as\nthe Scotch-Irish. They learned how to make poteen in little stills,\nafter the Irish fashion, and to defend their stills from intrusive\nforeigners, also after the Irish fashion. By and by these Scotch-Irish\nfell out with the British Government, and large bodies of them emigrated\nto America, settling, for the most part, in western Pennsylvania.\n\nThey were a fighting race. Accustomed to plenty of hard knocks at home,\nthey took to the rough fare and Indian wars of our border as naturally\nas ducks take to water. They brought with them, too, an undying hatred\nof excise laws, and a spirit of unhesitating resistance to any authority\nthat sought to enforce such laws.\n\nIt was these Scotchmen, in the main, assisted by a good sprinkling of\nnative Irish, and by the wilder blades among the Pennsylvania-Dutch, who\ndrove out the Indians from the Alleghany border, formed our rear-guard\nin the Revolution, won that rough mountain region for civilization, left\nit when the game became scarce and neighbors' houses too frequent,\nfollowed the mountains southward, settled western Virginia and Carolina,\nand formed the vanguard westward into Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri, and\nso onward till there was no longer a West to conquer. Some of their\ndescendants remained behind in the fastnesses of the Alleghanies, the\nBlue Ridge, and the Unakas, and became, in turn, the progenitors of that\nsingular race which, by an absurd pleonasm, is now commonly known as\nthe \"mountain whites,\" but properly southern highlanders.\n\nThe first generation of Pennsylvania frontiersmen knew no laws but those\nof their own making. They were too far away, too scattered, and too\npoor, for the Crown to bother with them. Then came the Revolution. The\nbackwoodsmen were loyal to the new American Government--loyal to a man.\nThey not only fought off the Indians from the rear, but sent many of\ntheir incomparable riflemen to fight at the front as well.\n\nThey were the first English-speaking people to use weapons of precision\n(the rifle, introduced by the Pennsylvania-Dutch about 1700, was used by\nour backwoodsmen exclusively throughout the war). They were the first to\nemploy open-order formation in civilized warfare. They were the first\noutside colonists to assist their New England brethren at the siege of\nBoston. They were mustered in as the First Regiment of Foot of the\nContinental Army (being the first troops enrolled by our Congress, and\nthe first to serve under a Federal banner). They carried the day at\nSaratoga, the Cowpens, and King's Mountain. From the beginning to the\nend of the war, they were Washington's favorite troops.\n\n\n[Illustration: A Tub Mill]\n\n\nAnd yet these same men were the first rebels against the authority of\nthe United States Government! And it was their old commander-in-chief,\nWashington himself, who had the ungrateful task of bringing them to\norder by a show of Federal bayonets.\n\nIt happened in this wise:\n\nUp to the year 1791 there had been no excise tax in the United Colonies\nor the United States. (One that had been tried in Pennsylvania was\nutterly abortive). Then the country fell upon hard times. A larger\nrevenue had to be raised, and Hamilton suggested an excise. The measure\nwas bitterly opposed by many public men, notably by Jefferson; but it\npassed. Immediately there was trouble in the tall timber.\n\nWestern Pennsylvania, and the mountains southward, had been settled, as\nwe have seen, by the Scotch-Irish; men who had brought with them a\ncertain fondness for whiskey, a certain knack in making it, and an\nintense hatred of excise, on general as well as special principles.\nThere were few roads across the mountains, and these few were\nexecrable--so bad, indeed, that it was impossible for the backwoodsmen\nto bring their corn and rye to market, except in a concentrated form.\nThe farmers of the seaboard had grown rich, from the high prices that\nprevailed during the French Revolution; but the mountain farmers had\nremained poor, owing partly to difficulties of tillage, but chiefly to\ndifficulties of transportation. As Albert Gallatin said, in defending\nthe western people, \"We have no means of bringing the produce of our\nlands to sale either in grain or in meal. We are therefore distillers\nthrough necessity, not choice, that we may comprehend the greatest value\nin the smallest size and weight. The inhabitants of the eastern side of\nthe mountains can dispose of their grain without the additional labor of\ndistillation at a higher price than we can after we have disposed that\nlabor upon it.\"\n\nAgain, as in all frontier communities, there was a scarcity of cash in\nthe mountains. Commerce was carried on by barter; but there had to be\nsome means of raising enough cash to pay taxes, and to purchase such\nnecessities as sugar, calico, gun powder, etc., from the peddlers who\nbrought them by pack train across the Alleghanies. Consequently a still\nhad been set up on nearly every farm. A horse could carry about sixteen\ngallons of liquor, which represented eight bushels of grain, in weight\nand bulk, and double that amount in value. This whiskey, even after it\nhad been transported across the mountains, could undersell even so\ncheap a beverage as New England rum--so long as no tax was laid upon it.\n\nBut when the newly created Congress passed an excise law, it virtually\nplaced a heavy tax on the poor mountaineers' grain, and let the grain of\nthe wealthy eastern farmers pass on to market without a cent of charge.\nNaturally enough, the excitable people of the border regarded such a law\nas aimed exclusively at themselves. They remonstrated, petitioned,\nstormed. \"From the passing of the law in January, 1791, there appeared a\nmarked dissatisfaction in the western parts of Pennsylvania, Maryland,\nVirginia, the Carolinas, and Georgia. The legislatures of North\nCarolina, Virginia and Maryland passed resolutions against the law, and\nthat of Pennsylvania manifested a strong spirit of opposition to it. As\nearly as 1791, Washington was informed that throughout this whole region\nthe people were ready for revolt.\" \"To tax their stills seemed a blow at\nthe only thing which obdurate nature had given them--a lot hard indeed,\nin comparison with that of the people of the sea-board.\"\n\nOur western mountains (we call most of them southern mountains now)\nresembled somewhat those wild highlands of Connemara to which reference\nhas been made--only they were far wilder, far less populous, and\ninhabited by a people still prouder, more independent, more used to\nbeing a law unto themselves than were their ancestors in old Hibernia.\nWhen the Federal exciseman came among this border people and sought to\nlevy tribute, they blackened or otherwise disguised themselves and\ntreated him to a coat of tar and feathers, at the same time threatening\nto burn his house. He resigned. Indignation meetings were held,\nresolutions were passed calling on all good citizens to _disobey_ the\nlaw, and whenever anyone ventured to express a contrary opinion, or\nrented a house to a collector, he, too, was tarred and feathered. If a\nprudent or ultra-conscientious individual took out a license and sought\nto observe the law, he was visited by a gang of \"Whiskey Boys\" who\nsmashed the still and inflicted corporal punishment upon its owner.\n\nFinally, warrants were issued against the lawbreakers. The attempt to\nserve these writs produced an uprising. On July 16, 1794, a company of\nmountain militia marched to the house of the inspector, General Neville,\nto force him to give up his commission. Neville fired upon them, and, in\nthe skirmish that ensued, five of the attacking force were wounded and\none was killed. The next day, a regiment of 500 mountaineers, led by\none \"Tom the Tinker,\" burned Neville's house, and forced him to flee for\nhis life. His guard of eleven U. S. soldiers surrendered, after losing\none killed and several wounded.\n\nA call was then issued for a meeting of the mountain militia at the\nhistoric Braddock's Field. On Aug. 1, a large body assembled, of whom\n2,000 were armed. They marched on Pittsburgh, then a village of 1,200\nsouls. The townsmen, eager to conciliate and to ward off pillage,\nappointed a committee to meet the mob half way. The committee, finding\nthat it could not induce the mountain men to go home, made a virtue of\nnecessity by escorting 5,400 of them into Pittsburgh town. As Fisher\nsays, \"The town was warned by messengers, and every preparation was\nmade, not for defense, but to extinguish the fire of the Whiskey Boys'\nthirst, which would prevent the necessity of having to extinguish the\nfire they might apply to houses.... Then the work began. Every citizen\nworked like a slave to carry provisions and buckets of whiskey to that\ncamp.\" Judge Brackenridge tells us that it was an expensive as well as\nlaborious day, and cost him personally four barrels of prime old\nwhiskey. The day ended in a bloodless, but probably uproarious,\njollification.\n\nOn this same day (the Governor of Pennsylvania having declined to\ninterfere) Washington issued a proclamation against the rioters, and\ncalled for 15,000 militia to quell the insurrection. Meantime he had\nappointed commissioners to go into the disaffected region and try to\npersuade the people to submit peacefully before the troops should\narrive. Peace was offered on condition that the leaders of the\ndisturbance should submit to arrest.\n\nWhile negotiations were proceeding, the army advanced. Eighteen\nringleaders of the mob were arrested, and the \"insurrection\" faded away\nlike smoke. When the troops arrived, there was nothing for them to do.\nThe insurgent leaders were tried for treason, and two of them were\nconvicted, but Washington pardoned both of them. The cost of this\nexpedition was more than one-third of the total expenditures of the\nGovernment, for that year, for all other purposes. The moral effect upon\nthe nation at large was wholesome, for the Federal Government had\ndemonstrated, on this its first test, that it could enforce its own laws\nand maintain domestic tranquility. The result upon the mountain people\nthemselves was dubious. Thomas Jefferson wrote to Madison in December:\n\"The information of our [Virginia's] militia, returned from the\nwestward, is uniform, that though the people there let them pass\nquietly, they were objects of their laughter, not of their fear; that\none thousand men could have cut off their whole force in a thousand\nplaces of the Alleghany; that their detestation of the excise law was\nuniversal, and has now associated with it a detestation of the\nGovernment; and that a separation which was perhaps a very distant and\nproblematical event, is now near and certain, and determined in the mind\nof every man.\"\n\nBut Jefferson himself came to the presidency within six years, and the\nexcise tax was promptly repealed, never again to be instituted, save as\na war measure, until within a time so recent that it is now remembered\nby men whom we would not call very old.\n\nThe moonshiners of our own day know nothing of the story that has here\nbeen written. Only once, within my knowledge, has it been told in the\nmountains, and then the result was so unexpected, that I append the\nincident as a color contrast to this rather sombre narrative.--\n\nI was calling on a white-bearded patriarch who was a trifle vain of his\nhistorical learning. He could not read, but one of his daughters read\nto him, and he had learned by heart nearly all that lay between the two\nlids of a \"Universal History\" such as book agents peddle about. Like one\nof John Fox's characters, he was fond of the expression \"hist'ry says\"\nso-and-so, and he considered it a clincher in all matters of debate.\n\nOur conversation drifted to the topic of moonshining.\n\n\"Down to the time of the Civil War,\" declared the old settler, \"nobody\npaid tax on the whiskey he made. Hit was thataway in my Pa's time, and\nin Gran'sir's, too. And so 'way back to the time of George Washington.\nNow, hist'ry says that Washington was the Father of his Country; and I\nreckon he was the _greatest_ man that ever lived--don't you?\"\n\nI murmured a complaisant assent.\n\n\"Waal, sir, if 't was right to make free whiskey in Washington's day,\nhit's right _now_!\" and the old man brought his fist down on the table.\n\n\"But that is where you make a mistake,\" I replied. \"Washington did\nenforce a whiskey tax.\" Then I told about the Whiskey Insurrection of\n1794.\n\nThis was news to Grandpa. He listened with deep attention, his brows\nlowering as the narrative proceeded. When it was finished he offered\nno comment, but brooded to himself in silence. My own thoughts wandered\nfar afield, until recalled to the topic by a blunt demand:\n\n\n[Illustration: Cabin on the Little Fork of Sugar Fork of Hazel Creek in\nwhich the author lived alone for three years]\n\n\n\"You say Washington done that?\"\n\n\"He did.\"\n\n\"George Washington?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir: the Father of his Country.\"\n\n\"Waal, I'm satisfied now that Washington was a leetle-grain cracked.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe law of 1791, although it imposed a tax on whiskey of only 9 to 11\ncents per proof gallon, came near bringing on a civil war, which was\nonly averted by the leniency of the Federal Government in granting\nwholesale amnesty. The most stubborn malcontents in the mountains moved\nsouthward along the Alleghanies into western Virginia and the Carolinas,\nwhere no serious attempt was made to collect the excise; so they could\npractice moonshining to their heart's content, and there their\ndescendants remain to-day.\n\nOn the accession of Jefferson, in 1800, the tax on spirits was repealed.\nThe war of 1812 compelled the Government to tax whiskey again, but as\nthis was a war tax, shared by commodities generally, it aroused no\nopposition. In 1817 the excise was again repealed; and from that time\nuntil 1862 no specific tax was levied on liquors. During this period of\nthirty-five years the average market price of whiskey was 24 cents a\ngallon, sometimes dropping as low as 14 cents. Spirits were so cheap\nthat a \"burning fluid,\" consisting of one part spirits of turpentine to\nfour or five parts alcohol was used in the lamps of nearly every\nhousehold. Moonshining, of course, had ceased to exist.\n\nThen came the Civil War. In 1862 a tax of 20 cents a gallon was levied.\nEarly in 1864 it rose to 60 cents. This cut off the industrial use of\nspirits, but did not affect its use as a beverage. In the latter part of\n1864 the tax leaped to $1.50 a gallon, and the next year it reached the\nprohibitive figure of $2. The result of such excessive taxation was just\nwhat it had been in the old times, in Great Britain. In and around the\ncenters of population there was wholesale fraud and collusion. \"Efforts\nmade to repress and punish frauds were of absolutely no account\nwhatever.... The current price at which distilled spirits were sold in\nthe markets was everywhere recognized and commented on by the press as\nless than the amount of the tax, allowing nothing whatever for the cost\nof manufacture.\"\n\nSeeing that the outcome was disastrous from a fiscal point of view--the\nrevenue from this source was falling to the vanishing point--Congress,\nin 1868, cut down the tax to 50 cents a gallon. \"Illicit distillation\npractically ceased the very hour that the new law came into operation;\n... the Government collected during the second year of the continuance\nof the act $3 for every one that was obtained during the last year of\nthe $2 rate.\"\n\nIn 1869 there came a new administration, with frequent removals of\nrevenue officials for political purposes. The revenue fell off. In 1872\nthe rate was raised to 70 cents, and in 1875 to 90 cents. The result is\nthus summarized by David A. Wells:\n\n\"Investigation carefully conducted showed that on the average the\nproduct of illicit distillation costs, through deficient yields, the\nnecessary bribery of attendants, and the expenses of secret and unusual\nmethods of transportation, from two to three times as much as the\nproduct of legitimate and legal distillation. So that, calling the\naverage cost of spirits in the United States 20 cents per gallon, the\nproduct of the illicit distiller would cost 40 to 60 cents, leaving but\n10 cents per gallon as the maximum profit to be realized from fraud\nunder the most favorable conditions--an amount not sufficient to offset\nthe possibility of severe penalties of fine, imprisonment, and\nconfiscation of property.... The rate of 70 cents ... constituted a\nmoderate temptation to fraud. Its increase to 90 cents constituted a\ntemptation altogether too great for human nature, as employed in\nmanufacturing and selling whiskey, to resist.... During 1875-6,\nhighwines sold openly in the Chicago and Cincinnati markets at prices\nless than the average cost of production plus the Government tax.\nInvestigations showed that the persons mainly concerned in the work of\nfraud were the Government officials rather than the distillers; and that\na so-called 'Whiskey Ring' ... extended to Washington, and embraced\nwithin its sphere of influence and participation, not merely local\nsupervisors, collectors, inspectors, and storekeepers of the revenue,\nbut even officers of the Internal Revenue Bureau, and probably, also,\npersons occupying confidential relations with the Executive of the\nNation.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSuch being the condition of affairs in the centers of civilization in\nthe latter part of the nineteenth century, let us now turn to the\nmountains, and see how matters stood among those primitive people who\nwere still tarrying in the eighteenth. Their situation at that time is\nthus briefly sketched by a southern historian[7]:\n\n\"Before the war these simple folks made their apples and peaches into\nbrandy, and their corn into whiskey, and these products, with a few\ncattle, some dried fruits, honey, beeswax, nuts, wool, hides, fur,\nherbs, ginseng and other roots, and woolen socks knitted by the women in\ntheir long winter evenings, formed the stock in trade which they\nbartered for their plain necessaries and few luxuries, their homespun\nand cotton cloths, sugar, coffee, snuff, and fiddles.... The raising of\na crop of corn in summer, and the getting out of tan-bark and lumber in\nwinter, were almost their only resources.... The burden of taxation\nrested lightly on them. For near two generations no excise duties had\nbeen levied.... The war came on. They were mostly loyal to the Union.\nThey paid the first moderate tax without a murmur.\n\n\"They were willing to pay any tax that they were able to pay. But\nsuddenly the tax jumped to $1.50, and then to $2, a gallon. The people\nwere goaded to open rebellion. Their corn at that time brought only from\n25 to 40 cents a bushel; apples and peaches, rarely more than 10 cents\nat the stills. These were the only crops that could be grown in their\ndeep and narrow valleys. Transportation was so difficult, and markets so\nremote, that there was no way to utilize the surplus except to distill\nit. Their stills were too small to bear the cost of government\nsupervision. The superior officers of the Revenue Department\n(collectors, marshals, and district-attorneys or commissioners) were\npaid only by commissions on collections and by fees. Their subordinate\nagents, whose income depended upon the number of stills they cut up and\nupon the arrests made, were, as a class, brutal and desperate\ncharacters. Guerrilla warfare was the natural sequence.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\"BLOCKADERS\" AND \"THE REVENUE\"\n\n\nLittle or no attention seems to have been paid to the moonshining that\nwas going on in the mountains until about 1876, owing, no doubt, to the\nlarger game in registered distilleries. In his report for 1876-7, the\nnew Commissioner of Internal Revenue called attention to the illicit\nmanufacture of whiskey in the mountain counties of the South, and urged\nvigorous measures for its immediate suppression.\n\n\"The extent of these frauds,\" said he, \"would startle belief. I can\nsafely say that during the past year not less than 3,000 illicit stills\nhave been operated in the districts named. Those stills are of a\nproducing capacity of 10 to 50 gallons a day. They are usually located\nat inaccessible points in the mountains, away from the ordinary lines of\ntravel, and are generally owned by unlettered men of desperate\ncharacter, armed and ready to resist the officers of the law. Where\noccasion requires, they come together in companies of from ten to fifty\npersons, gun in hand, to drive the officers out of the country. They\nresist as long as resistance is possible, and when their stills are\nseized, and they themselves are arrested, they plead ignorance and\npoverty, and at once crave the pardon of the Government.\n\n\"These frauds had become so open and notorious ... that I became\nsatisfied extraordinary measures would be required to break them up.\nCollectors were ... each authorized to employ from five to ten\nadditional deputies.... Experienced revenue agents of perseverance and\ncourage were assigned to duty to co-operate with the collectors. United\nStates marshals were called upon to co-operate with the collectors and\nto arrest all persons known to have violated the laws, and\ndistrict-attorneys were enjoined to prosecute all offenders.\n\n\"In certain portions of the country many citizens not guilty of\nviolating the law themselves were in strong sympathy with those who did\nviolate, and the officers in many instances found themselves unsupported\nin the execution of the laws by a healthy state of public opinion. The\ndistillers--ever ready to forcibly resist the officers--were, I have no\ndoubt, at times treated with harshness. This occasioned much\nindignation on the part of those who sympathized with the\nlawbreakers....\"\n\nThe Commissioner recommended, in his report, the passage of a law\n\"expressly providing that where a person is caught in the act of\noperating an illicit still, he may be arrested without warrant.\" In\nconclusion, he said: \"At this time not only is the United States\ndefrauded of its revenues, and its officers openly resisted, but when\narrests are made it often occurs that prisoners are rescued by mob\nviolence, and officers and witnesses are often at night dragged from\ntheir homes and cruelly beaten, or waylaid and assassinated.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOne day I asked a mountain man, \"How about the revenue officers? What\nsort of men are they?\"\n\n\"Torn down scoundrels, every one.\"\n\n\"Oh, come, now!\"\n\n\"Yes, they are; plumb onery--lock, stock, barrel and gun-stick.\"\n\n\"Consider what they have to go through,\" I remarked. \"Like other\ndetectives, they cannot secure evidence without practicing deception.\nTheir occupation is hard and dangerous. Here in the mountains, every\nman's hand is against them.\"\n\n\"Why is it agin them? We ain't all blockaders; yet you can search these\nmountains through with a fine-tooth comb and you wunt find ary critter\nas has a good word to say for the revenue. The reason is 't we know them\nmen from 'way back; we know whut they uster do afore they jined the\nsarvice, and why they did it. Most of them were blockaders their own\nselves, till they saw how they could make more money turncoatin'. They\nuse their authority to abuse people who ain't never done nothin' nohow.\nDangerous business? Shucks! There's Jim Cody, for a sample [I suppress\nthe real name]; he was principally raised in this county, and I've\nknowed him from a boy. He's been eight years in the Government sarvice,\nand hain't never been shot at once. But he's killed a blockader--oh,\nyes! He arrested Tom Hayward, a chunk of a boy, that was scared most\nfitified and never resisted more'n a mouse. Cody, who was half drunk\nhis-self, handcuffed Tom, quarreled with him, and shot the boy dead\nwhile the handcuffs was on him! Tom's relations sued Cody in the County\nCourt, but he carried the case to the Federal Court, and they were too\npoor to follow it up. I tell you, though, thar's a settlement less 'n a\nthousand mile from the river whar Jim Cody ain't never showed his nose\nsence. He knows there'd be another revenue 'murdered.'\"\n\n\"It must be ticklish business for an officer to prowl about the\nheadwaters of these mountain streams, looking for 'sign.'\"\n\n\"Hell's banjer! they don't go prodjectin' around looking for stills.\nThey set at home on their hunkers till some feller comes and informs.\"\n\n\"What class of people does the informing?\"\n\n\"Oh, sometimes hit's some pizen old bum who's been refused credit.\nSometimes hit's the wife or mother of some feller who's drinkin' too\nmuch. Then, agin, hit may be some rival blockader who aims to cut off\nthe other feller's trade, and, same time, divert suspicion from his own\nself. But ginerally hit's jest somebody who has a gredge agin the\nblockader fer family reasons, or business reasons, and turns informer to\ngit even.\"\n\nIt is only fair to present this side of the case, because there is much\ntruth in it, and because it goes far to explain the bitter feeling\nagainst revenue agents personally that is almost universal in the\nmountains, and is shared even by the mountain preachers. It should be\nunderstood, too, in this connection, that the southern highlander has a\nlong memory. Slights and injuries suffered by one generation have their\nscars transmitted to sons and grandsons. There is no denying that there\nhave been officers in the revenue service who, stung by the contempt in\nwhich they were held as renegades from their own people, have used their\nauthority in settling private scores, and have inflicted grievous wrongs\nupon innocent people. This is matter of official record. In his report\nfor 1882, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue himself declared that\n\"Instances have been brought to my attention where numerous prosecutions\nhave been instituted for the most trivial violations of law, and the\narrested parties taken long distances and subjected to great\ninconveniences and expense, not in the interest of the Government, but\napparently for no other reason than to make costs.\"\n\nAn ex-United States Commissioner told me that, in the darkest days of\nthis struggle, when he himself was obliged to buckle on a revolver every\ntime he put his head out of doors, he had more trouble with his own\ndeputies than with the moonshiners. \"As a rule, none but desperadoes\ncould be hired for the service,\" he declared. \"For example, one time my\ndeputy in your county wanted some liquor for himself. He and two of his\ncronies crossed the line into South Carolina, raided a still, and got\nbeastly drunk. The blockaders bushwhacked them, riddled a mule and its\nrider with buckshot, and shot my deputy through the brain with a\nsquirrel rifle. We went over there and buried the victims a few days\nlater, during a snow storm, working with our holster flaps unbuttoned. I\nhad all that work and worry simply because that rascal was bent on\ngetting drunk without paying for it. However, it cost him his life.\n\n\"They were not all like that, though,\" continued the Judge. \"Now and\nthen there would turn up in the service a man who had entered it from\nhonorable motives, and whose conduct, at all times, was chivalric and\nclean. There was Hersh Harkins, for example, now United States Collector\nat Asheville. I had many cases in which Harkins figured.\"\n\n\"Tell me of one,\" I urged.\n\n\"Well, one time there was a man named Jenks [that was not the real name,\nbut it will serve], who was too rich to be suspected of blockading.\nJenks had a license to make brandy, but not whiskey. One day Harkins was\nvisiting his still-house, and he noticed something dubious. Thrusting\nhis arm down through the peach pomace, he found mash underneath. It is a\npenitentiary offense to mix the two. Harkins procured more evidence\nfrom Jenk's distiller, and hauled the offender before me. The trial was\nconducted in a hotel room, full of people. We were not very formal in\nthose days--kept our hats on. There was no thought of Jenks trying to\nrun away, for he was well-to-do; so he was given the freedom of the\nroom. He paced nervously back and forth between my desk and the door,\ngrowing more restless as the trial proceeded. A clerk sat near me,\nwriting a bond, and Harkins stood behind him dictating its terms.\nSuddenly Jenks wheeled around, near the door, jerked out a navy\nrevolver, fired and bolted. It is hard to say whom he shot at, for the\nbullet went through Harkins's coat, through the clerk's hat, and through\nmy hat, too. I ducked under the desk to get my revolver, and Harkins,\nthinking that I was killed, sprang to pick me up; but I came up firing.\nIt was wonderful how soon that room was emptied! Harkins took after the\nfugitive, and had a wild chase; but he got him.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was my good fortune, a few evenings later, to have a long talk with\nMr. Harkins himself. He was a fine giant of a man, standing six feet\nthree, and symmetrically proportioned. No one looking into his kindly\ngray eyes would suspect that they belonged to one who had seen as hard\nand dangerous service in the Revenue Department as any man then living.\nIn an easy, unassuming way he told me many stories of his own adventures\namong moonshiners and counterfeiters in the old days when these southern\nAppalachians fairly swarmed with desperate characters. One grim affair\nwill suffice to give an impression of the man, and of the times in which\nhis spurs were won.\n\nThere was a man on South Mountain, South Carolina, whom, for the sake of\nrelatives who may still be living, we will call Lafonte. There was\ninformation that Lafonte was running a blind tiger. He got his whiskey\nfrom four brothers who were blockading near his father's house, just\nwithin the North Carolina line. The Government had sent an officer named\nMerrill to capture Lafonte, but the latter drove Merrill away with a\nshotgun. Harkins then received orders to make the arrest. Taking Merrill\nwith him as guide, Harkins rode to the father's house, and found Lafonte\nhimself working near a high fence. As soon as the criminal saw the\nofficers approaching, he ran for the house to get his gun. Harkins\ngalloped along the other side of the fence, and, after a\nrough-and-tumble fight, captured his man. The officers then carried\ntheir prisoner to the house of a man whose name I have forgotten--call\nhim White--who lived about two miles away. Meantime they had heard\nLafonte's sister give three piercing screams as a signal to his\nconfederates in the neighborhood, and they knew that trouble would\nquickly brew.\n\nBreakfast was ready in White's home when the mob arrived. Harkins sent\nMerrill in to breakfast, and himself went out on the porch, carbine in\nhand, to stand off the thoroughly angry gang. White also went out,\nbeseeching the mob to disperse. Matters looked squally for a time, but\nit was finally agreed that Lafonte should give bond, whereupon he was\npromptly released.\n\nThe two officers then finished their breakfast, and shortly set out for\nthe Blue House, an abandoned schoolhouse about forty miles distant,\nwhere the trial was to be conducted. They were followed at a distance by\nLafonte's half-drunken champions, who were by no means placated, owing\nto the fact that the Blue House was in a neighborhood friendly to the\nGovernment. Harkins and Merrill soon dodged to one side in the forest,\nuntil the rioters had passed them, and then proceeded leisurely in the\nrear. On their way to the Blue House they cut up four stills,\ndestroyed a furnace, and made several arrests.\n\n\n[Illustration: A Mountain Home]\n\n\nThe next day three United States commissioners opened court in the old\nschoolhouse. The room was crowded by curious spectators. The trial had\nnot proceeded beyond preliminaries when shots and shouts from the\npursuing mob were heard in the distance. Immediately the room was\nemptied of both crowd and commissioners, who fled in all directions,\nleaving Harkins and Merrill to fight their battle alone.\n\nThere were thirteen men in the moonshiners' mob. They surrounded the\nhouse, and immediately began shooting in through the windows. The\nofficers returned the fire, but a hard-pine ceiling in the room caused\nthe bullets of the attacking party to ricochet in all directions and\nmade the place untenable. Harkins and his comrade sprang out through the\nwindows, but from opposite sides of the house. Merrill ran, but Harkins\ngrappled with the men nearest to him, and in a moment the whole force of\ndesperadoes was upon him like a swarm of bees. Unfortunately, the brave\nfellow had left his carbine at the house where he had spent the night.\nHis only weapon was a revolver that had only three cartridges in the\ncylinder. Each of these shots dropped a man; but there were ten men\nleft. Nothing but Harkins's gigantic strength saved him, that day, from\nimmediate death. His long arms tackled three or four men at once, and\nall went down in a bunch. Others fell on top, as in a college cane-rush.\nThere had been swift shooting, hitherto, but now it was mostly knife and\npistol-butt. It is almost incredible, but it is true, that this\nextraordinary battle waged for three-quarters of an hour. At its end\nonly one man faced the now thoroughly exhausted and badly wounded, but\nindomitable officer. At this fellow, Harkins hurled his pistol; it\nstruck him in the forehead, and the battle was won.\n\nA thick overcoat that Mr. Harkins wore was pierced by twenty-one\nbullets, seven of which penetrated his body. He received, besides, three\nor four bad knife-wounds in his back, and he was literally dripping\nblood from head to foot.\n\nThis tragedy had an almost comic sequel. After all danger had passed, a\nsheriff appeared on the scene, who placed, not the mob-leader, but the\nFederal officer under arrest. Harkins left a guard over the three men\nwhom he had shot, and submitted to arrest, but demanded that he be taken\nto the farmhouse where he had left his horse. This the sheriff actually\nrefused to permit, although Harkins was evidently past all possibility\nof continuing far afoot. Disgusted at such imbecility, the deputy\nstalked away from the sheriff, leaving the latter with his mouth open,\nand utterly obsessed.\n\nA short distance up the road, Harkins met a countryman mounted on a\nsorry old mule. \"Loan me that mule for half an hour,\" he requested; \"you\nsee, I can walk no further.\" But the fellow, scared out of his wits by\nthe spectacle of a man in such desperate plight, refused to accommodate\nhim.\n\n\"Get down off that mule, or I'll break your neck!\"\n\nThe mule changed riders.\n\nWhen the story was finished, I asked Mr. Harkins if it was true, as the\nreading public generally believes, that moonshiners prefer death to\ncapture. \"Do they shoot a revenue officer at sight?\"\n\nThe answer was terse:\n\n\"They used to shoot; nowadays they run.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe have come to the time when our Government began in dead earnest to\nfight the moonshiners and endeavor to suppress their traffic. It was in\n1877. To give a fair picture, from the official standpoint, of the state\nof affairs at that time, I will quote from the report of the\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue for the year 1877-78:\n\n\"It is with extreme regret,\" he said, \"I find it my duty to report the\ngreat difficulties that have been and still are encountered in many of\nthe Southern States in the enforcement of the laws. In the mountain\nregions of West Virginia, Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina,\nGeorgia and Alabama, and in some portions of Missouri, Arkansas and\nTexas, the illicit manufacture of spirits has been carried on for a\nnumber of years, and I am satisfied that the annual loss to the\nGovernment from this source has been very nearly, if not quite, equal to\nthe annual appropriation for the collection of the internal revenue tax\nthroughout the whole country. In the regions of country named there are\nknown to exist about 5,000 copper stills, many of which at certain times\nare lawfully used in the production of brandy from apples and peaches,\nbut I am convinced that a large portion of these stills have been and\nare used in the illicit manufacture of spirits. Part of the spirits thus\nproduced has been consumed in the immediate neighborhood; the balance\nhas been distributed and sold throughout the adjacent districts.\n\n\"This nefarious business has been carried on, as a rule, by a\ndetermined set of men, who in their various neighborhoods league\ntogether for defense against the officers of the law, and at a given\nsignal are ready to come together with arms in their hands to drive the\nofficers of internal revenue out of the country.\n\n\"As illustrating the extraordinary resistance which the officers have\nhad on some occasions to encounter, I refer to occurrences in Overton\nCounty, Tennessee, in August last, where a posse of eleven internal\nrevenue officers, who had stopped at a farmer's house for the night,\nwere attacked by a band of armed illicit distillers, who kept up a\nconstant fusillade during the whole night, and whose force was augmented\nduring the following day till it numbered nearly two hundred men. The\nofficers took shelter in a log house, which served them as a fort,\nreturning the fire as best they could, and were there besieged for\nforty-two hours, three of their party being shot--one through the body,\none through the arm, and one in the face. I directed a strong force to\ngo to their relief, but in the meantime, through the intervention of\ncitizens, the besieged officers were permitted to retire, taking their\nwounded with them, and without surrendering their arms.\n\n\"So formidable has been the resistance to the enforcement of the laws\nthat in the districts of 5th Virginia, 6th North Carolina, South\nCarolina, 2d and 5th Tennessee, 2d West Virginia, Arkansas, and\nKentucky, I have found it necessary to supply the collectors with\nbreech-loading carbines. In these districts, and also in the States of\nGeorgia, Alabama, Mississippi, in the 4th district of North Carolina,\nand in the 2d and 5th districts of Missouri, I have authorized the\norganization of posses ranging from five to sixty in number, to aid in\nmaking seizures and arrests, the object being to have a force\nsufficiently strong to deter resistance if possible, and, if need be, to\novercome it.\"\n\nThe intention of the Revenue Department was certainly not to inflame the\nmountain people, but to treat them as considerately as possible. And\nyet, the policy of \"be to their faults a little blind\" had borne no\nother fruit than to strengthen the combinations of moonshiners and their\nsympathizers to such a degree that they could set the ordinary force of\nofficers at defiance, and things had come to such a pass that men of\nwide experience in the revenue service had reached the conclusion that\n\"the fraud of illicit distilling was an evil too firmly established to\nbe uprooted, and that it must be endured.\"\n\nThe real trouble was that public sentiment in the mountains was almost\nunanimously in the moonshiners' favor. Leading citizens were either\ndirectly interested in the traffic, or were in active sympathy with the\ndistillers. \"In some cases,\" said the Commissioner, \"State officers,\nincluding judges on the bench, have sided with the illicit distillers\nand have encouraged the use of the State courts for the prosecution of\nthe officers of the United States upon all sorts of charges, with the\nevident purpose of obstructing the enforcement of the laws of the United\nStates.... I regret to have to record the fact that when the officers of\nthe United States have been shot down from ambuscade, in cold blood, as\na rule no efforts have been made on the part of the State officers to\narrest the murderers; but in cases where the officers of the United\nStates have been engaged in enforcement of the laws, and have\nunfortunately come in conflict with the violators of the law, and\nhomicides have occurred, active steps have been at once taken for the\narrest of such officers, and nothing would be left undone by the State\nauthorities to bring them to trial and punishment.\"\n\nThere is no question but that this statement of the Commissioner was a\nfair presentation of facts; but when he went on to expose the root of\nthe evil, the underlying sentiment that made, and still makes, illicit\ndistilling popular among our mountaineers, I think that he was\nsingularly at fault. This was his explanation--the only one that I have\nfound in all the reports of the Department from 1870 to 1904:\n\n\"Much of the opposition to the enforcement of the internal revenue laws\n[he does not say _all_, but offers no other theory] is properly\nattributable to a latent feeling of hostility to the government and laws\nof the United States still prevailing in the breasts of a portion of the\npeople of these districts, and in consequence of this condition of\nthings the officers of the United States have often been treated very\nmuch as though they were emissaries from some foreign country quartered\nupon the people for the collection of tribute.\"\n\nThis shows an out-and-out misunderstanding of the character of the\nmountain people, their history, their proclivities, and the\ncircumstances of their lives. The southern mountaineers, as a class,\nhave been remarkably loyal to the Union ever since it was formed. Far\nmore of them fought for the Union than for the Confederacy in our Civil\nWar. And, anyway, politics has never had anything to do with the\nmoonshining question. The reason for illicit distilling is purely an\neconomic one, as I have shown. If officers of the Federal Government\nhave been treated as foreigners they have met the same reception that\n_all_ outsiders meet from the mountaineers. A native of the Carolina\ntidewater is a \"furriner\" in the Carolina mountains, and so is a native\nof the \"bluegrass\" when he enters the eastern hills of his own State.\nThe highlander's word \"furriner\" means to him what +barbaros+ did\nto an ancient Greek. Ordinarily he is courteous to the unfortunate\nalien, though never deferential; in his heart of hearts he regards the\nqueer fellow with lofty superiority. This trait is characteristic of all\nprimitive peoples, of all isolated peoples. It is provincialism, pure\nand simple--a provincialism more crudely expressed in Appalachia than in\nGotham or The Hub, but no cruder in essence for all that.\n\nThe vigorous campaign of 1877 bore such fruit that, in the following\nyear, the Commissioner was able to report: \"We virtually have peaceable\npossession of the districts of 4th and 5th North Carolina, Georgia, West\nTennessee, Kentucky, Alabama, and Arkansas, in many of which formidable\nresistance to the enforcement of the law has prevailed.... In the\nwestern portion of the 5th Virginia district, in part of West Virginia,\nin the 6th North Carolina district, in part of South Carolina, and in\nthe 2d and 5th districts of Tennessee, I apprehend further serious\ndifficulties.... It is very desirable, in order to prevent bloodshed,\nthat the internal revenue forces sent into these infected regions to\nmake seizures and arrests shall be so strong as to deter armed\nresistance.\"\n\nIn January, 1880, a combined movement by armed bodies of internal\nrevenue officers was made from West Virginia southwestward through the\nmountains and foothills infested with illicit distillers. \"The effect of\nthis movement was to convince violators of the law that it was the\ndetermination of the Government to put an end to frauds and resistance\nof authority, and since that time it has been manifest to all\nwell-meaning men in those regions of the country that the day of the\nillicit distiller is past.\" In his report for 1881-82 the Commissioner\ndeclared that \"The supremacy of the laws ... has been established in all\nparts of the country.\"\n\nAs a matter of fact, the number of arrests per annum, which hitherto had\nranged from 1,000 to 3,000, now dropped off considerably, and the\ncasualties in the service became few and far between. But, in 1894,\nCongress increased the tax on spirits from the old 90 cents figure to\n$1.10 a gallon. The effect was almost instantaneous. We have no means\nof learning how many new moonshine stills were set up, but we do know\nthat the number of seizures doubled and trebled, and that bloodshed\nproportionally increased. Again the complaint went out that \"justice was\nfrequently defeated,\" even in cases of conviction, by failure to visit\nadequate punishment upon the offenders. It is, to-day, a notorious fact\nthat our blockaders dread their own State courts far more than they do\nthe Federal courts, because the punishment for selling liquor in the\nmountain counties is surer to follow conviction than is the penalty for\nviolating Federal law. The latter is severe enough, if it were enforced;\nfor defrauding, or attempting to defraud, the United States of the tax\non spirits, the law prescribes forfeiture of the distillery and\napparatus, and of all spirits and raw materials, besides a fine of not\nless than $500 nor more than $5,000, _and_ imprisonment for not less\nthan six months nor longer than three years. I am not able to say what\npercentage of arrests is followed by conviction, nor how many convicted\npersons suffer the full penalty of the law. I only know that public\nopinion in the mountains did not consider an arrest, or even a\nconviction, by the Federal authorities, as a very serious matter during\nthe period from 1880 up to the past two or three years, and little\nresistance was offered by blockaders when captured.\n\nRecently, however, a new factor has entered the moonshining problem and\nprofoundly altered it: the South has gone \"dry.\"\n\nOne might have expected that prohibition would be bitterly opposed in\nAppalachia, in view of the fact that here the old-fashioned principle\nstill prevails, in practice, that moderate drinking is neither a sin nor\na disgrace, and that a man has the same right to make his own whiskey as\nhis own soup, if he chooses. Undoubtedly those who fight the liquor\ntraffic on purely moral grounds are a small minority in the mountains.\nBut the blockaders themselves are glad to see prohibitory laws enforced\nto the letter, so far as saloons and registered distilleries are\nconcerned, and the drinking public prefer their native product from both\npatriotic and gustatory motives. Such a combination is irresistible.\n\nWhen pure \"blockade\" of normal strength sold as cheaply as it did before\nprohibition there was no great profit in it, all risks and expenses\nconsidered. But to-day, even with interstate shipments of liquors to\nconsumers, a gallon of \"blockade\" will be watered to half-strength, then\nfortified with cologne spirits or other abominations, and peddled out\nby bootleggers, at $1.50 a quart, in villages and lumber camps where\nsomebody always is thirsty and can find the coin to assuage it. Thus,\namid a poverty-stricken class of mountaineers, the temptation to run a\nsecret still, and adulterate the output, inflames and spreads.\n\nIn any case, the fact is that blockading as a business conducted in\narmed defiance of the law is increasing by leaps and bounds since the\nmountain region went \"dry.\" The profits to-day are much greater than\nbefore, because liquor is harder to get, in country districts, and\nconsumers will pay higher prices without question.\n\nCorrespondingly, the risks are greater than ever. Arrests have increased\nrapidly, and so have mortal combats between officers and outlaws.\nBlockading has returned to much the same status described (as previously\nquoted) by our Commissioner of Internal Revenue in 1876. I have not seen\nrecent revenue reports, but I do not need to; for the war between\nofficers and moonshiners is so close to us that we almost live within\ngun-crack of it. If Mr. Harkins were alive to-day, he would say: \"They\nused to shoot--and they have taken it up again.\"\n\nObserve, please, that this is no argument for or against prohibition.\nThat is not my business. As a descriptive writer it is my duty to\ncollect facts, whether pleasant or unpleasant, regardless of my own or\nanyone else's bias, and present them in orderly sequence. It is for the\nreader to deduce his own conclusions, and with them I have nothing at\nall to do.\n\nI have given in brief the history of illicit distilling because we must\nconsider it before we can grasp firmly the basic fact that this is not\nso much a moral as an economic problem. Men do not make whiskey in\nsecret, at the peril of imprisonment or death, because they are outlaws\nby nature nor from any other kind of depravity, but simply and solely\nbecause it looks like \"easy money to poor folks.\"\n\nIf I may voice my own opinion of a working remedy, it is this: Give the\nmountaineers a lawful chance to make decent livings where they are. This\nmeans, first of all, decent roads whereby to market their farm produce\nwithout losing all profit in cost of transportation. The first problem\nof Appalachia to-day is the very same problem as that of western\nPennsylvania in 1784.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nTHE OUTLANDER AND THE NATIVE\n\n\nAmong the many letters that come to me from men who think of touring or\ncamping in Highland Dixie there are few but ask, \"How are strangers\ntreated?\"\n\nThis question, natural and prudent though it be, never fails to make me\nsmile, for I know so well the thoughts that lie back of it: \"Suppose one\nshould blunder innocently upon a moonshine still--what would happen? If\na feud were raging in the land, how would a stranger fare? If one goes\nalone into the mountains, does he run any risk of being robbed?\"\n\nBefore I left the tame West and came into this wild East, I would have\nasked a few questions myself, if I had known anyone to answer them. As\nit was, I turned up rather abruptly in a backwoods settlement where the\n\"furriner\" was more than a nine-days wonder. I bore no credentials; and\nit was quite as well. If I had presented a letter from some clergyman or\nfrom the President of the United States it would have been--just what I\nwas myself--a curiosity: as when the puppy discovers some weird and\nmarvelous new bug.\n\nEveryone greeted me politely but with unfeigned interest. I was welcome\nto sup and bed wherever I went. Moonshiners and man-slayers were as\naffable as common folks. I dwelt alone for a long time, first in open\ncamp, afterwards in a secluded hut. Then I boarded with a native family.\nOften I left my belongings to look out for themselves whilst I went away\non expeditions of days or weeks at a time. And nobody ever stole from me\nso much as a fish-hook or a brass cartridge. So, in the retrospect, I\nsmile.\n\nDoes this mean, then, that Poe's characterization of the mountaineers is\nout of date? Not at all. They are the same \"fierce and uncouth race of\nmen\" to-day that they were in his time. Homicide is so prevalent in the\ndistricts that I personally am acquainted with that nearly every adult\ncitizen has been directly interested in some murder case, either as\nprincipal, officer, witness, kinsman, or friend.\n\nThis grewsome subject I shall treat elsewhere, in detail. It is\nintroduced here only to emphasize a fact pertinent to the present topic,\nnamely: that the private wars of the highlanders are limited to their\nown people. In our corner of North Carolina no traveler from the\noutside ever has been a victim, nor do I know of any such case in the\nwhole Appalachian region.\n\n\n[Illustration: Many of the homes have but one window]\n\n\nAnd here is another significant fact: as regards personal property I do\nnot know any race in the world that is more honest than our backwoodsmen\nof the southern mountains. As soon as you leave the railroad you enter a\nland where sneak-thieves are rare and burglars almost unheard of. In my\nown county and all those adjoining it there has been only one case of\nhighway robbery and only one of murder for money, so far as I can learn,\nin the past _forty_ years.\n\nThe mountain code of conduct is a curious mixture of savagery and\ncivility. One man will kill another over a pig or a panel of fence (not\nfor the property's sake, but because of hot words ensuing) and he will\n\"come clear\" in court because every fellow on the jury feels he would\nhave done the same thing himself under similar provocation; yet these\nvery men, vengeful and cruel though they are, regard hospitality as a\nsacred duty toward wayfarers of any degree, and the bare idea of\nstealing from a stranger would excite their instant loathing or\nwhite-hot scorn.\n\nAnyone of tact and common sense can go as he pleases through the darkest\ncorner of Appalachia without being molested. Tact, however, implies the\nwill and the insight to put yourself truly in the other man's place.\nImagine yourself born, bred, circumstanced like him. It implies, also,\nthe courtesy of doing as you would be done by if you were in that\nfellow's shoes. No arrogance, no condescension, but man to man on a\nfooting of equal manliness.\n\nAnd there are \"manners\" in the rudest community: customs and rules of\nconduct that it is well to learn before one goes far afield. For\nexample, when you stop at a mountain cabin, if no dogs sound an alarm,\ndo not walk up to the door and knock. You are expected to call out\n_Hello!_ until someone comes to inspect you. None but the most intimate\nneighbors neglect this usage and there is mighty good reason back of it\nin a land where the path to one's door may be a warpath.\n\nIf you are armed, as a hunter, do not fail to remove the cartridges from\nthe gun, in your host's presence, before you set foot on his porch. Then\ngive him the weapon or stand it in a corner or hang it up in plain view.\nEven our sheriff, when he stopped with us, would lay his revolver on the\nmantel-shelf and leave it there until he went his way. If you think a\nmoment you can see the courtesy of such an act. It proves that the\nguest puts implicit trust in the honor of his host and in his ability to\nprotect all within his house. There never has been a case in which such\ntrust was violated.\n\nI knew a traveler who, spending the night in a one-room cabin, was fool\nenough (I can use no milder term) to thrust a loaded revolver under his\npillow when he went to bed. In the morning his weapon was still there,\nbut empty, and its cartridges lay conspicuously on a table across the\nroom. Nobody said a word about the incident: the hint was left to soak\nin.\n\nThe only real danger that one may encounter from the native people, so\nlong as he behaves himself, is when he comes upon a man who is wild with\nliquor and cannot sidestep him. In such case, give him the glad word and\nmove on at once. I have had a drunken \"ball-hooter\" (log-roller) from\nthe lumber camps fire five shots around my head as a _feu-de-joie_, and\nthen stand tantalizingly, with hammer cocked over the sixth cartridge,\nto see what I would do about it. As it chanced, I did not mind his\nfireworks, for my head was a-swim with the rising fever of erysipelas\nand I had come dragging my heels many an irk mile down from the\nmountains to find a doctor. So I merely smiled at the fellow and asked\nif he was having a good time. He grinned sheepishly and let me pass\nunharmed.\n\nThe chief drawback to travel in this region, aside from the roads, is\nnot the character of the people, but the quality of bed and board. Of\ncourse there are good hotels at most of the summer resorts, but these\nare few and scattering, at present, for a territory so immense. In most\nregions where there is noble scenery, unspoiled forest, and good\nfishing, the accommodations are extremely rude. Many of the village inns\nare dirty, and their tables a shock and a despair to the hungry pilgrim.\nThere are blessed exceptions, to be sure, but on the other hand the\ntraveler sometimes will encounter a cuisine that is neither edible nor\nspeakable, and will be shown to a bed wherein it needs no Sherlock\nHolmes to detect that the previous biped retired with his boots on, or\nat least with much realty attached to his person. Such places often are\nlike that unpronounceable town in Russia of which Paragot said: \"The\nbugs are the most companionable creatures in it, and they are the\ncleanest.\"\n\nIf one be of the same mind as the plain-spoken Dr. Samuel Johnson, that\n\"the finest landscape in the world is not worth a damn without a cozy\ninn in the foreground,\" he should keep to the stock show-places of our\nhighlands or seek other playgrounds.\n\nBy far the most comfortable way to stay in the back country at present\nis in a camp of one's own where he can keep things tidy and have food to\nsuit him. If you be, though, of stout stomach and wishful to get true\ninsight into mountain ways and character you can find some sort of\nboarding-place almost anywhere. In such case go first to the sheriff of\nthe county (in person, not by letter). This officer is a walking bureau\nof information and dispenses it freely to any stranger. He knows almost\nevery man in the county, his character and his circumstances. He may be\ndepended upon to direct you to the best stopping-places, will tell you\nhow to get hunting and fishing privileges, and will recommend a good\npacker or teamster if such help is wanted.\n\nAlong the railways and main county roads the farmers show a\nwell-justified mistrust about admitting company for the night. But in\nthe back districts the latch-string generally is out to all comers. \"If\nyou-uns can stand what we-uns has ter, w'y come right in and set you a\ncheer.\"\n\nIf the man of the house has misgivings as to the state of the larder, he\nwill say: \"I'll ax the woman gin she can git ye a bite.\" Seldom does\nthe wife demur, though sometimes her patience is sorely tried.\n\nA stranger whose calked boots betrayed his calling stopped at Uncle\nMark's to inquire, \"Can I git to stay all night?\" Aunt Nance, peeping\nthrough a crack, warned her man in a whisper: \"Them loggers jest louzes\nup folkses houses.\" Whereat Mark answered the lumberjack: \"We don't\nginerally foller takin' in strangers.\"\n\nJack glanced significantly at the lowering clouds, and grunted:\n\"Uh--looks like I could stand hitched all night!\"\n\nThis was too much for Mark. \"Well!\" he exclaimed, \"mebbe we-uns can find\nye a pallet--I'll try to enjoy ye somehow.\" Which, being interpreted,\nmeans, \"I'll entertain you as best I can.\"\n\nThe hospitality of the backwoods knows no bounds short of sickness in\nthe family or downright destitution. Travelers often innocently impose\non poor people, and even criticise the scanty fare, when they may be\ngetting a lion's share of the last loaf in the house. And few of them\nrealize the actual cost of entertaining company in a home that is long\nmountain miles from any market. Fancy yourself making a twenty-mile\nround trip over awful roads to carry back a sack of flour on your\nshoulder and a can of oil in your hand; then figure what the\ntransportation is worth.\n\nOnce when I was trying a short-cut through the forest by following vague\ndirections I swerved to the wrong trail. Sunset found me on the summit\nof an unfamiliar mountain, with cold rain setting in, and below me lay\nthe impenetrable laurel of Huggins's Hell. I turned back to the head of\nthe nearest water course, not knowing whither it led, fought my way\nthrough thicket and darkness to the nearest house, and asked for\nlodging. The man was just coming in from work. He betrayed some anxiety\nbut admitted me with grave politeness. Then he departed on an errand,\nleaving his wife to hear the story of my wanderings.\n\nI was eager for supper; but madame made no move toward the kitchen. An\nhour passed. A little child whimpered with hunger. The mother, flushing,\nsoothed it on her breast.\n\nIt was well on in the night when her husband returned, bearing a little\n\"poke\" of cornmeal. Then the woman flew to her post. Soon we had hot\nbread, three or four slices of pork, and black coffee unsweetened--all\nthere was in the house.\n\nIt developed that when I arrived there was barely enough meal for the\nfamily's supper and breakfast. My host had to shell some corn, go in\nalmost pitch darkness, without a lantern, to a tub-mill far down the\nbranch, wait while it ground out a few spoonfuls to the minute and bring\nthe meal back.\n\nNext morning, when I offered pay for my entertainment, he waved it\naside. \"I ain't never tuk money from company,\" he said, \"and this ain't\nno time to begin.\"\n\nLaughing, I slipped some silver into the hand of the eldest child. \"This\nis not pay; it's a present.\" The girl was awed into speechlessness at\nsight of money of her own, and the parents did not know how to thank me\nfor her, but bade me \"Stay on, stranger; pore folks has a pore way, but\nyou're welcome to what we got.\"\n\nThis incident is a little out of the common, nowadays; but it is typical\nof what was customary until lumbering and other industrial works began\nto invade the solitudes. To-day it is the rule to charge twenty-five\ncents a meal and the same for lodging, regardless of what the fare and\nthe bed may be. When you think of it, this is right, for \"the porer\nfolks is the harder it is to _git_ things.\"\n\nThe mountaineers always are eager for news. In the drab monotony of\ntheir shut-in lives the coming of an unknown traveler is an event that\nwill set the whole neighborhood gossiping. Every word and action of his\nwill be discussed for weeks after he has gone his way. This, of course,\nis a trait of rural people everywhere; but imagine, if you can, how it\nmay be intensified where there are no newspapers, few visitors, and\nwhere the average man gets maybe two or three letters a year!\n\nRiding up a branch road, you come upon a white-bearded patriarch who\nhalts you with a wave of the hand.\n\n\"Stranger--meanin' no harm--_whar_ are you gwine?\"\n\nYou tell him.\n\n\"What did you say your name was?\"\n\nYou had not mentioned it; but you do so now.\n\n\"What mought you-uns foller for a living?\"\n\nIt is wise to humor the old man, and tell him frankly what is your\nbusiness \"up this 'way-off branch.\"\n\nHalf a mile farther you espy a girl coming toward you. She stops like a\nstartled fawn, wide-eyed with amazement. Then, at a bound, she dodges\ninto a thicket, doubles on her course and runs back as fast as her\nnimble bare legs can carry her to report that \"Some-_body_ 's comin'!\"\n\nAt the next house, stopping for a drink of water, you chat a few\nmoments. High up the opposite hill is a half-hidden cabin from which\nkeen eyes scrutinize your every move, and a woman cries to her boy:\n\"Run, Kit, down to Mederses, and ax who _is_ he!\"\n\nAs you approach a cross-roads store every idler pricks up to instant\nattention. Your presence is detected from every neighboring cabin and\ncornfield. Long John quits his plowing, Red John drops his axe, Sick\nJohn (\"who's allers ailin', to hear _him_ tell\") pops out of bed, and\nLyin' John (whose \"mouth ain't no praar-book, if it _does_ open and\nshet\") grabs his hat, with \"I jes' got ter know who that feller is!\"\nThen all Johns descend their several paths, to congregate at the store\nand estimate the stranger as though he were so many board-feet of lumber\nin the tree or so many pounds of beef on the hoof.\n\nIn every settlement there is somebody who makes a pleasure of gathering\nand spreading news. Such a one we had--a happy-go-lucky fellow from\nwhom, they said, \"you can hear the news jinglin' afore he comes within\ngunshot.\" It amused me to record the many ways he had of announcing his\nmission by indirection. Here is the list:\n\n\"I'm jes' broguin' about.\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm jest cooterin' around.\"\n\n\"I'm santerin' about.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm jes' prodjectin' around.\"\n\n\"Jist traffickin' about.\"\n\n\"No, I ain't workin' none--jest spuddin' around.\"\n\n\"Me? I'm jes' shacklin' around.\"\n\n\"Yea, la! I'm jist loaferin' about.\"\n\nAnd yet one hears that our mountaineers have a limited vocabulary!\n\nAlthough this is no place to discuss the mountain dialect, I must\nexplain that to \"brogue\" means to go about in brogues (brogans\nnowadays). A \"cooter\" is a box-tortoise, and the noun is turned into a\nverb with an ease characteristic of the mountaineers. \"Spuddin' around\"\nmeans toddling or jolting along. To \"shummick\" (also \"shammick\") is to\nshuffle about, idly nosing into things, as a bear does when there is\nnothing serious in view. And \"shacklin' around\" pictures a shackly,\nloose-jointed way of walking, expressive of the idle vagabond.\n\nA stranger takes the mountaineers for simple characters that can be\ngauged at a glance. This illusion--for it is an illusion--comes from\nthe childlike directness with which they ask him the most intimate\nquestions about himself, from the genuine good-will with which they\nadmit him to their homes, and from the stark openness of their domestic\naffairs in houses where no privacy can possibly exist.\n\nIn so far as simplicity means only a shrewd regard for essentials, a\nrigid exclusion of whatever can be done without, perhaps no white race\nis nearer a state of nature than these highlanders of ours. Yet this\nrelates only to the externals of life. Diogenes sat in a tub, but his\nthoughts were deep as the sea. And whoever estimates our mountaineers as\na shallow-minded or open-minded people has much to learn.\n\nWhen Long John asks, \"What you aimin' to do up hyur? How much money do\nyou make? Whar's your old woman?\" he does not really expect sincere\nanswers. Certainly he will take them with more than a grain of salt.\nConversation, with him, is a game. In quizzing you, the interests that\nhe is actually curious about lie hidden in the back of his head, and he\nwill proceed toward them by cunning circumventions, seeking to entrap\nyou into telling the truth by accident. Being himself born to intrigue\nand skilled in dodging the leading question, he assumes that you have\nhad equal advantages. When you discuss with him any business of serious\nconcern, if you should go straight to the point, and open your mind\nfrankly, he would be nonplussed.\n\nThe fact is that our highlanders are a sly, suspicious, and secretive\nfolk. That, too, is a state of nature. Primitive society is by no means\na Utopia or a Garden of Eden. In wilderness life the feral arts of\nconcealment, spying, false \"leads,\" and doubling on trails, are the arts\nself-preservative. The native backwoodsman practices them as\ninstinctively and with as little compunction upon his own species as\nupon the deer and the wolf from whom he learned them.\n\nAs a friend, no one will spring quicker to your aid, reckless of\nconsequences, and fight with you to the last ditch; but fear of betrayal\nlies at the very bottom of his nature. His sleepless suspicion of\nulterior motives is no more, no less, than a feral trait, inherited from\na long line of forebears whose isolated lives were preserved only by\nincessant vigilance against enemies that stalked by night and struck\nwithout warning.\n\nCasual visitors learn nothing about the true character of the\nmountaineers. I am not speaking of personal but of race character--type.\nNo outsider can discern and measure those powerful but obscure motives,\nthose rooted prejudices, that constitute their real difference from\nother men, until he has lived with the people a long time on terms of\nintimacy. Nor can anyone be trusted to portray them if he holds a brief\neither for or against this people. The fluttering tourist marks only the\noddities he sees, without knowing the reason for them. On the other\nhand, a misguided champion flies to arms at first mention of an\nunpleasant fact, and either denies it, clamoring for legal proof, or\ntries to befog the whole subject and run it on the rocks of altercation.\n\nThe mountaineers are high-strung and sensitive to criticism. No one has\nless use for \"that worst scourge of avenging heaven, the candid friend.\"\nOf late years they are growing conscious of their own belatedness, and\nthat touches a tender spot. \"Hit don't take a big seed to hurt a sore\ntooth.\" Since they do not see how anyone can find beauty or historic\ninterest in ways of life that the rest of the world has cast aside, so\nthey resent every exposure of their peculiarities as if that were\nholding them up to ridicule or blame.\n\nStrange to say, it provokes them to be called mountaineers, that being a\n\"furrin word\" which they take as a term of reproach. They call\nthemselves mountain people, or citizens; sometimes humorously \"mountain\nboomers,\" the word boomer being their name for the common red squirrel\nwhich is found here only in the upper zones of the mountains.\nBackwoodsman is another term that they deem opprobrious. Among\nthemselves the backwoods are called \"the sticks.\" Hillsman and\nhighlander are strange words to them--and anything that is strange is\nsuspicious. Hence it is next to impossible for anyone to write much\nabout these people without offending them or else falling into singsong\nrepetition of the same old terms.\n\nI have found it beyond me to convince anyone here that my studies of the\nmountain dialect are made from any better motive than vulgar curiosity.\nIt has been my habit to jot down, on the spot, every dialectical word or\nvariant or idiom that I hear, along with the phrase or sentence in which\nit occurred; for I never trust memory in such matters. And although I\ntell frankly what I am about, and why, yet all that the folks can or\nwill see is that--\n\n  A chiel 's amang ye, takin' notes,\n  And, faith, he'll prent 'em.\n\n\nNothing worse than dour looks has yet befallen me, but other scribes\nhave not got off so easy. On more than one occasion newspaper men who\nwent into eastern Kentucky to report feuds were escorted forcibly to the\nrailroad and warned never to return. The feudists are scarce to blame,\nfor the average news story of their wars is neither sacred nor profane\nhistory. It is bad enough to be shown up as an assassin; but when one is\nposed as \"cocking the _trigger_\" of a gun, or shooting a \"forty-four\"\nbullet from a thirty-caliber \"automatic _revolver_,\" who in Kentucky\ncould be expected to stand it?\n\nThe novelists have their troubles, too. President Frost relates that\nwhen John Fox gave a reading from his Cumberland tales at Berea College\n\"the mountain boys were ready to mob him. They had no comprehension of\nthe nature of fiction. Mr. Fox's stories were either true or false. If\nthey were true, then he was 'no gentleman' for telling all the family\naffairs of people who had entertained him with their best. If they were\nnot true, then, of course, they were libellous upon the mountain people.\nSuch an attitude may remind us of the general condemnation of fiction by\nthe 'unco gude' a generation ago.\"\n\n\n[Illustration: The Schoolhouse]\n\n\nAs for settlement workers, let them teach more by example than by\nprecept. Bishop Wilson has given them some advice that cannot be\nbettered: \"It must be said with emphasis that our problem is an\nexceedingly delicate one. The Highlanders are Scotch-Irish in their\nhigh-spiritedness and proud independence. Those who would help them must\ndo so in a perfectly frank and kindly way, showing always genuine\ninterest in them but never a trace of patronizing condescension. As\nquick as a flash the mountaineer will recognize and resent the intrusion\nof any such spirit, and will refuse even what he sorely needs if he\ndetects in the accents or the demeanor of the giver any indication of an\nair of superiority.\"\n\n\"The worker among the mountaineers,\" he continues, \"must 'meet with them\non the level and part on the square' and conquer their oftentimes\nunreasonable suspicion by genuine brotherly friendship. The less he has\nto say about the superiority of other sections or of the deficiencies of\nthe mountains, the better for his cause. The fact is that comparatively\nfew workers are at first able to pass muster in this regard under the\nsearching and silent scrutiny of the mountain people.\"\n\nAllow me to add that this is no place for the \"unco gude\" to exercise\ntheir talents, but rather for those whose studies and travels have\ntaught them both tolerance and hopefulness. Some well-meaning\nmissionaries are shocked and scandalized at what seems to them incurable\nperversity and race degeneration. It is nothing of the sort. There are\nreasons, good reasons, for the worst that we find in any Hell-fer-Sartin\nor Loafer's Glory. All that is the inevitable result of isolation and\nlack of opportunity. It is no more hopeless than the same features of\nlife were in the Scotch highlands two centuries ago.\n\nBut it must be known that the future of this really fine race is, at\nbottom, an economic problem, which must be studied hand-in-hand with the\neducational one. Civilization only repels the mountaineer until you show\nhim something to gain by it--he knows by instinct what he is bound to\nlose. There is no use in teaching cleanliness and thrift to serfs or\noutcasts. The _independence_ of the mountain farm must be preserved, or\nthe fine spirit of the race will vanish and all that is manly in the\nHighlander will wither to the core.\n\nIt is far from my own purpose to preach or advise. \"Portray the\nstruggle, and you need write no tract.\" Still farther is it from my\nthought to let characterization degenerate into caricature. Wherever I\ntell anything that is unusual or below the average of backwoods life, I\ngive fair warning that it is admitted only for spice or contrast, and\nlet it go at that. But even in writing with severe restraint it will be\nnecessary at times to show conditions so rude and antiquated that\nprofessional apologists will growl, and many others may find my\nstatements hard to credit as typical of anything at all in our modern\nAmerica.\n\nSo, let me remind the reader again that full three-fourths of our\nmountaineers still live in the eighteenth century, and that in their\nfar-flung wilderness, away from large rivers and railways, the habits,\ncustoms, morals of the people have changed but little from those of our\nold colonial frontier; in essentials they are closely analogous to what\nwe read of lower-class English and Scottish life in Covenanter and\nJacobite times.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nTHE PEOPLE OF THE HILLS\n\n\nIn delineating a strange race we are prone to disregard what is common\nin our own experience and observe sharply what is odd. The oddities we\nsketch and remember and tell about. But there is little danger of\nmisrepresenting the physical features and mental traits of the hill\npeople, because among them there is one definite type that greatly\npredominates. This is not to be wondered at when we remember that fully\nthree-fourths of our highlanders are practically of the same descent,\nhave lived the same kind of life for generations, and have intermarried\nto a degree unknown in other parts of America.\n\nOur average mountaineer is lean, inquisitive, shrewd. If that be what\nconstitutes a Yankee, as is popularly supposed outside of New England,\nthen this Yankee of the South is as true to type as the conventional\nUncle Sam himself.\n\nA fat mountaineer is a curiosity. The hill folk even seem to affect a\nslender type of comeliness. In Alice MacGowan's _Judith of the\nCumberlands_, old Jepthah Turrentine says of one of his sons: \"I named\nthat boy after the finest man that ever walked God's green earth--and\nthen the fool had to go and git fat on me! Think of me with a _fat_ son!\nI allers did hold that a fat woman was bad enough, but a fat man ort\np'intedly to be led out and killed!\"\n\nSpartan diet does not put on flesh. Still, it should be noted that long\nlegs, baggy clothing, and scantiness or lack of underwear make people\nseem thinner than they really are. Our highlanders are conspicuously a\ntall race. Out of seventy-six men that I have listed just as they\noccurred to me, but four are below average American height and only two\nare fat. About two-thirds of them are brawny or sinewy fellows of great\nendurance. The others generally are slab-sided, stoop-shouldered, but\nwithey. The townsfolk and the valley farmers, being better nourished and\nmore observant of the prime laws of wholesome living, are noticeably\nsuperior in appearance but not in stamina.\n\nNearly all males of the back country have a grave and deliberate\nbearing. They travel with the long, sure-footed stride of the born\nwoodsman, not graceful and lithe like a moccasined Indian (their coarse\nbrogans forbid it), but shambling as if every joint had too much play.\nThere is nothing about them to suggest the Swiss or Tyrolean\nmountaineers; rather they resemble the gillies of the Scotch Highlands.\nGenerally they are lean-faced, sallow, level-browed, with rather high\ncheek-bones. Gray eyes predominate, sometimes vacuous, but oftener hard,\nsearching, crafty--the feral eye of primitive man.\n\nFrom infancy these people have been schooled to dissimulate and hide\nemotion, and ordinarily their faces are as opaque as those of veteran\npoker players. Many wear habitually a sullen scowl, hateful and\nsuspicious, which in men of combative age, and often in the old women,\nis sinister and vindictive. The smile of comfortable assurance, the\nfrank eye of good-fellowship, are rare indeed. Nearly all of the young\npeople and many of the adults plant themselves before a stranger and\nregard him with a fixed stare, peculiarly annoying until one realizes\nthat they have no thought of impertinence.\n\nMany of the women are pretty in youth; but hard toil in house and field,\nearly marriage, frequent child-bearing with shockingly poor attention,\nand ignorance or defiance of the plainest necessities of hygiene, soon\nwarp and age them. At thirty or thirty-five a mountain woman is apt to\nhave a worn and faded look, with form prematurely bent--and what wonder?\nAlways bending over the hoe in the cornfield, or bending over the hearth\nas she cooks by an open fire, or bending over her baby, or bending to\npick up, for the thousandth time, the wet duds that her lord flings on\nthe floor as he enters from the woods--what wonder that she soon grows\nshort-waisted and round-shouldered?\n\nThe voices of the highland women, low toned by habit, often are\nsingularly sweet, being pitched in a sad, musical, minor key. With\nstrangers, the women are wont to be shy, but speculative rather than\ntimid, as they glance betimes with \"a slow, long look of mild inquiry,\nor of general listlessness, or of unconscious and unaccountable\nmelancholy.\" Many, however, scrutinize a visitor calmly for minutes at a\ntime or frankly measure him with the gipsy eye of Carmen.\n\nOutsiders, judging from the fruits of labor in more favored lands, have\ncharged the mountaineers with indolence. It is the wrong word. Shiftless\nmany of them are--afflicted with that malady which Barrie calls \"acute\ndisinclination to work\"--but that is not so much in their physical\nnature as in their economic outlook. Rarely do we find mountaineers who\nloaf all day on the floor or the doorstep like so many of the poor\nwhites of the lowlands. If not laboring, they at least must be doing\nsomething, be it no more than walking ten miles to shoot a squirrel or\nvisit a crony.\n\nAs a class, they have great and restless physical energy. Considering\nthe quantity and quality of what they eat there is no people who can\nbeat them in endurance of strain and privation. They are great walkers\nand carriers of burdens. Before there was a tub-mill in our settlement\none of my neighbors used to go, every other week, thirteen miles to\nmill, carrying a two-bushel sack of corn (112 pounds) and returning with\nhis meal on the following day. This was done without any pack-strap but\nsimply shifting the load from one shoulder to the other, betimes.\n\nOne of our women, known as \"Long Goody\" (I measured her; six feet three\ninches she stood) walked eighteen miles across the Smokies into\nTennessee, crossing at an elevation of 5,000 feet, merely to shop more\nadvantageously than she could at home. The next day she shouldered fifty\npounds of flour and some other groceries, and bore them home before\nnightfall. Uncle Jimmy Crawford, in his seventy-second year came to\njoin a party of us on a bear hunt. He walked twelve miles across the\nmountain, carrying his equipment and four days' rations for himself _and\ndogs_. Finding that we had gone on ahead of him he followed to our camp\non Siler's Bald, twelve more miles, climbing another 3,000 feet, much of\nit by bad trail, finished the twenty-four-mile trip in seven hours--and\nthen wanted to turn in and help cut the night-wood. Young mountaineers\nafoot easily outstrip a horse on a day's journey by road and trail.\n\n\n[Illustration: \"At thirty a mountain woman is apt to have a worn and\nfaded look\"]\n\n\nIn a climate where it showers about two days out of three through spring\nand summer the women go about, like the men, unshielded from the wet. If\nyou expostulate, one will laugh and reply: \"I ain't sugar, nor salt, nor\nnobody's honey.\" Slickers are worn only on horseback--and two-thirds of\nour people had no horses. A man who was so eccentric as to carry an\numbrella is known to this day as \"Umbrell'\" John Walker.\n\nIn winter, one sometimes may see adults and children going barefoot in\nsnow that is ankle deep. It used to be customary in our settlement to do\nthe morning chores barefooted in the snow. \"Then,\" said one, \"our feet\n'd tingle and burn, so 't they wouldn't git a bit cold all day when we\nput our shoes on.\" I knew a family whose children had no shoes all one\nwinter, and occasionally we had zero weather.\n\nIt seems to have been common, in earlier times, to go barefooted all the\nyear. Frederick Law Olmsted, a noted writer of the Civil War period, was\ntold by a squire of the Tennessee hills that \"a majority of the folks\nwent barefoot all winter, though they had snow much of the time four or\nfive inches deep; and the man said he didn't think most of the men about\nhere had more than one coat, and they never wore one in winter except on\nholidays. 'That was the healthiest way,' he reckoned, 'just to toughen\nyourself and not wear no coat.' No matter how cold it was, he 'didn't\nwear no coat.'\" One of my own neighbors in the Smokies never owned a\ncoat until after his marriage, when a friend of mine gave him one.\n\nIt is the usual thing for men and boys to wade cold trout streams all\nday, come in at sunset, disrobe to shirt and trousers, and then sit in\nthe piercing drafts of an open cabin drying out before the fire, though\nthe night be so cool that a stranger beside them shivers in his dry\nflannels. After supper, the women, if they have been wearing shoes, will\nremove them to ease their feet, no matter if it be freezing cold--and\nthe cracks in the floor may be an inch wide.\n\nIn bear hunting, our parties usually camped at about 5,000 feet above\nsea level. At this elevation, in the long nights before Christmas, the\ncold often was bitter and the wind might blow a gale. Sometimes the\nnative hunters would lie out in the open all night without a sign of a\nblanket or an axe. They would say: \"La! many's the night I've been out\nwhen the frost was spewed up so high [measuring three or four inches\nwith the hand], and that right around the fire, too.\" Cattle hunters in\nthe mountains never carry a blanket or a shelter-cloth, and they sleep\nout wherever night finds them, often in pouring rain or flying snow. On\ntheir arduous trips they find it burden enough to carry the salt for\ntheir cattle, with a frying-pan, cup, corn pone, coffee, and\n\"sow-belly,\" all in a grain sack strapped to the man's back.\n\nSuch nurture, from childhood, makes white men as indifferent to the\nelements as Fuegians. And it makes them anything but comfortable\ncompanions for one who has been differently reared. During \"court week\"\nwhen the hotels at the county-seat are overcrowded with countrymen, the\nluckless drummers who happen to be there have continuous exercise in\nclosing doors. No mountaineer closes a door behind him. Winter or\nsummer, doors are to be shut only when folks go to bed. That is what\nthey are for. After close study of mountain speech I have failed to\ndiscern that the word draft is understood, except in parts of the\nVirginia and Kentucky mountains, where it means a brook. One is reminded\nof the colonial, who, visiting England, remarked of the British people:\n\"It is a survival of the fittest--the fittest to exist in fog.\" Here, it\nis the fittest to survive cold, and wet, and drafts.\n\nRunning barefooted in the snow is exceptional nowadays; but it is by no\nmeans the limit of hardiness or callosity that some of these people\ndisplay. It is not so long ago that I passed an open lean-to of chestnut\nbark far back in the wilderness, wherein a family of Tennesseans was\nspending the year. There were three children, the eldest a lad of\ntwelve. The entire worldly possessions of this family could easily be\npacked around on their backs. Poverty, however, does not account for\nsuch manner of living. There is none so poor in the mountains that he\nneed rear his children in a bark shed. It is all a matter of taste.\n\nThere is a wealthy man known to everyone around Waynesville, who, being\nasked where he resided, as a witness in court, answered: \"Three, four\nmiles up and down Jonathan Creek.\" The judge was about to fine him for\ncontempt, when it developed that the witness spoke literal truth. He\nlives neither in house nor camp, but perambulates his large estate and\nwhen night comes lies down wherever he may happen to be. In winter he\nhas been known to go where some of his pigs bedded in the woods, usurp\nthe middle for himself, and borrow comfort from their bodily heat.\n\nThis man is worth over a hundred thousand dollars. He visited the\nworld's fairs at Chicago and St. Louis, wearing the old long coat that\nserves him also as blanket, and carrying his rations in a sack. Far from\nbeing demented, he is notoriously so shrewd on the stand and so learned\nin the law that he is formidable to every attorney who cross-questions\nhim.\n\nI cite these last two instances not merely as eccentricities of\ncharacter, but as really typical of the bodily stamina that most of the\nmountaineers can display if they want to. Their smiling endurance of\ncold and wet and privation would have endeared them to the first\nNapoleon, who declared that those soldiers were the best who bivouacked\nshelterless throughout the year.\n\nIn spite of such apparent \"toughness,\" the mountaineers are not a\nnotably healthy people. The man who exposes himself wantonly year after\nyear must pay the piper. Sooner or later he \"adopts a rheumatiz,\" and\nthe adoption lasts till he dies. So also in dietary matters. The\nbackwoodsmen through ruthless weeding-out of the normally sensitive have\nacquired a wonderful tolerance of swimming grease, doughy bread and\nhalf-fried cabbage; but, even so, they are gnawed by dyspepsia. This\naccounts in great measure for the \"glunch o' sour disdain\" that mars so\nmany countenances. A neighbor said to me of another: \"He has a gredge\nagin all creation, and glories in human misery.\" So would anyone else\nwho ate at the same table. Many a homicide in the mountains can be\ntraced directly to bad food and the raw whiskey taken to appease a\nsoured stomach.\n\nEvery stranger in Appalachia is quick to note the high percentage of\ndefectives among the people. However, we should bear in mind that in the\nmountains proper there are few, if any, public refuges for this class,\nand that home ties are so powerful that mountaineers never send their\n\"fitified folks\" or \"half-wits,\" or other unfortunates, to any\ninstitution in the lowlands, so long as it is bearable to have them\naround. Such poor creatures as would be segregated in more advanced\ncommunities, far from the public eye, here go at large and reproduce\ntheir kind.\n\nExtremely early marriages are tolerated, as among all primitive people.\nI knew a hobbledehoy of sixteen who married a frail, tuberculous girl of\ntwelve, and in the same small settlement another lad of sixteen who\nwedded a girl of thirteen. In both cases the result was wretched beyond\ndescription.\n\nThe evil consequences of inbreeding of persons closely akin are well\nknown to the mountaineers; but here knowledge is no deterrent, since\nwhole districts are interrelated to start with. Owing to the isolation\nof the clans, and their extremely limited travels, there are abundant\ncases like those caustically mentioned in _King Spruce_: \"All Skeets and\nBushees, and married back and forth and crossways and upside down till\nev'ry man is his own grandmother, if he only knew enough to figger\nrelationship.\"\n\nThe mountaineers are touchy on these topics and it is but natural that\nthey should be so. Nevertheless it is the plain duty of society to study\nsuch conditions and apply the remedy. There was a time when the Scotch\npeople (to cite only one instance out of many) were in still worse\ncase, threatened with race degeneration; but improved economic\nconditions, followed by education, made them over into one of the most\nvigorous of modern peoples.\n\nWhen I lived up in the Smokies there was no doctor within sixteen miles\n(and then, none who ever had attended a medical school). It was\ninevitable that my first-aid kit and limited knowledge of medicine\nshould be requisitioned until I became a sort of \"doctor to the\nsettle_ment_.\"[8] My services, being free, at once became popular, and\nthere was no escape; for, if I treated the Smiths, let us say, and\nignored a call from the Robinsons, the slight would be resented by all\nRobinson connections throughout the land. So my normal occupations often\nwere interrupted by such calls as these:\n\n\"John's Lize Ann she ain't much; cain't you-uns give her some\neasin'-powder for that hurtin' in her chist?\"\n\n\"Old Uncle Bobby Tuttle's got a pone come up on his side; looks like he\nmought drap off, him bein' weak and right narvish and sick with a\nhead-swimmin'.\"\n\n\"Ike Morgan Pringle's a-been horse-throwed down the clift, and he's in a\nmanner stone dead.\"\n\n\"Right sensibly atween the shoulders I've got a pain; somethin' 's gone\nwrong with my stummick; I don't 'pear to have no stren'th left; and\nsometimes I'm nigh sifflicated. Whut you reckon ails me?\"\n\n\"Come right over to Mis' Fullwiler's, quick; she's fell down and busted\na rib inside o' her!\"\n\nOn these errands of mercy I soon picked up some rules of practice that\nare not laid down in the books. I learned to carry not only my own\nbandages but my own towels and utensils for washing and sterilizing. I\nkept my mouth shut about germ theories of disease, having no troops to\nenforce orders and finding that mere advice incited downright\nperversity. I administered potent drugs in person and left nothing to be\ntaken according to direction except placebos.\n\nOnce, in forgetfulness, I left a tablet of corrosive sublimate on the\nmantel after dressing a wound, and the man of the house told me next day\nthat he had \"'lowed to swaller it' and see if it wouldn't ease his\nheadache!\" A geologist and I, exploring the hills with a mountaineer,\nfell into discussion of filth diseases and germs, not realizing that we\nwere overheard. Happening to pass an ant-hill, Frank remarked to me\nthat formic acid was supposed to be antagonistic to the germ of\nlaziness. Instantly we heard a growl from our woodsman: \"By God, I was\n_expectin'_ to hear the like o' that!\"\n\nOrdinarily wounds are stanched with dusty cobwebs and bound up in any\nold rag. If infection ensues, Providence has to take the blame. A woman\ngashed her foot badly with an axe; I asked her what she did for it;\ndisdainfully she answered, \"Tied it up in sut and a rag, and went to\nhoein' corn.\"\n\nAn injured person gets scant sympathy, if any. So far as outward\ndemeanor goes, and public comment, the witnesses are utterly callous.\nThe same indifference is shown in the face of impending death. People\ncrowd around with no other motive, seemingly, than morbid curiosity to\nsee a person die. I asked our local preacher what the folks would do if\na man broke his thigh so that the bone protruded. He merely elevated his\neyebrows and replied: \"We'd set around and sing until he died.\"\n\nThe mountaineers' fortitude under severe pain is heroic, though often\nneedless. For all minor operations and frequently for major ones they\nobstinately refuse to take an anesthetic, being perversely suspicious\nof everything that they do not understand. Their own minor surgery and\nobstetric practice is barbarous. A large proportion of the mountain\ndoctors know less about human anatomy than a butcher does about a pig's.\nSometimes this ignorance passes below ordinary common sense. There is a\n\"doctor\" still practicing who, after a case of confinement, sits beside\nthe patient and presses hard upon the hips for half an hour, explaining\nthat it is to \"push the bones back into place; don't you know they\nallers comes uncoupled in the socket?\" This, I suppose, is the limit;\nbut there are very many practicing physicians in the back country who\ncould not name or locate the arteries of either foot or hand to save\ntheir lives.\n\nIt was here I first heard of \"tooth-jumping.\" Let one of my old\nneighbors tell it in his own way:\n\n\"You take a cut nail (not one o' those round wire nails) and place its\nsquar p'int agin the ridge of the tooth, jest under the edge of the gum.\nThen jump the tooth out with a hammer. A man who knows how can jump a\ntooth without it hurtin' half as bad as pullin'. But old Uncle Neddy\nCyarter went to jump one of his own teeth out, one time, and missed the\nnail and mashed his nose with the hammer. He had the weak trembles.\"\n\n\"I have heard of tooth-jumping,\" said I, \"and reported it to dentists\nback home, but they laughed at me.\"\n\n\"Well, they needn't laugh; for it's so. Some men git to be as\nexperienced at it as tooth-dentists are at pullin'. They cut around the\ngum, and then put the nail at jest sich an angle, slantin' downward for\nan upper tooth, or upwards for a lower one, and hit one lick.\"\n\n\"Will the tooth come at the first lick?\"\n\n\"Ginerally. If it didn't, you might as well stick your head in a swarm\no' bees and fergit who you are.\"\n\n\"Are back teeth extracted in that way?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; any kind of a tooth. I've burnt my holler teeth out with a\nred-hot wire.\"\n\n\"Good God!\"\n\n\"Hit's so. The wire'd sizzle like fryin'.\"\n\n\"Kill the nerve?\"\n\n\"No; but it'd sear the mar so it wouldn't be so sensitive.\"\n\n\"Didn't hurt, eh?\"\n\n\"Hurt like hell for a moment. I held the wire one time for Jim Bob\nJimwright, who couldn't reach the spot for hisself. I _told_ him to hold\nhis tongue back; but when I touched the holler he jumped and wropped\nhis tongue agin the wire. The words that man used ain't fitty to tell.\"\n\nSome of the ailments common in the mountains were new to me. For\ninstance, \"dew pizen,\" presumably the poison of some weed, which,\ndissolved in dew, enters the blood through a scratch or abrasion. As a\nwoman described it, \"Dew pizen comes like a risin', and laws-a-marcy how\nit does hurt! I stove a brier in my heel wunst, and then had to hunt\ncows every morning in the dew. My leg swelled up black to clar above the\nknee, and Dr. Stinchcomb lanced the place seven times. I lay on a pallet\non the floor for over a month. My leg like to killed me. I've seed\npersons jest a lot o' sores all over, as big as my hand, from dew\npizen.\"\n\nA more mysterious disease is \"milk-sick,\" which prevails in certain\nrestricted districts, chiefly where the cattle graze in rich and deeply\nshaded coves. If not properly treated it is fatal both to the cow and to\nany human being who drinks her fresh milk or eats her butter. It is not\ntransmitted by sour milk or by buttermilk. There is a characteristic\nfetor of the breath. It is said that milk from an infected cow will not\nfoam and that silver is turned black by it. Mountaineers are divided in\nopinion as to whether this disease is of vegetable or of mineral origin;\nsome think it is an efflorescence from gas that settles on plants. This\nmuch is certain: that it disappears from \"milk-sick coves\" when they are\ncleared of timber and the sunlight let in. The prevalent treatment is an\nemetic, followed by large doses of apple brandy and honey; then oil to\nopen the bowels. Perhaps the extraordinary distaste for fresh milk and\nbutter, or the universal suspicion of these foods that mountaineers\nevince in so many localities, may have sprung up from experience with\n\"milk-sick\" cows. I have not found this malady mentioned in any treatise\non medicine; yet it has been known from our earliest frontier times.\nAbraham Lincoln's mother died of it.\n\nThat the hill folk remain a rugged and hardy people in spite of\nunsanitary conditions so gross that I can barely hint at them, is due\nchiefly to their love of pure air and pure water. No mountain cabin\nneeds a window to ventilate it: there are cracks and cat-holes\neverywhere, and, as I have said, the doors are always open except at\nnight. \"Tight houses,\" sheathed or plastered, are universally despised,\npartly from inherited shiftlessness, partly for less obvious reasons.\n\nOne of Miss MacGowan's characters fairly insulted the neighborhood by\nbuilding a modern house. \"Why lordy! Lookee hyer, Creed,\" remonstrated\nDoss Provine over a question of matching boards and battening joints,\n\"ef you git yo' pen so almighty tight as that you won't git no fresh\nair. Man's bound to have ventilation. Course you can leave the do' open\nall the time like we-all do; but when you're a-holdin' co't and\nsech-like maybe you'll want to shet the do' sometimes--and then whar'll\nye git breath to breathe?... All these here glass winders is blame\nfoolishness to _me_. Ef ye need light, open the do'. Ef somebody comes\nthat ye don't want in, you can shet it and put up a bar. But saw the\nwalls full o' holes an' set in glass winders, an' any feller that's got\na mind to can pick ye off with a rifle ball as easy as not whilst ye set\nby the fire of an evenin'.\"\n\nWhen mountain people move to the lowlands and go to living in\ntight-framed houses, they soon deteriorate like Indians. It is of no use\nto teach them to ventilate by lowering windows from the top. That is\nsome more \"blame foolishness\"--their adherence to old ways is stubborn,\nsullen, and perverse to a degree that others cannot comprehend. Then,\ntoo, in the lowlands, they simply cannot stand the water. As Emma Miles\nsays: \"No other advantages will ever make up for the lack of good water.\nThere is a strong prejudice against pumps; if a well must be dug, it is\nusually left open to the air, and the water is reached by means of a\nhooked pole which requires some skillful manipulation to prevent losing\nthe bucket. Cisterns are considered filthy; water that has stood\novernight is 'dead water,' hardly fit to wash one's face in. The\nmountaineer takes the same pride in his water supply as the rich man in\nhis wine cellar, and is in this respect a connoisseur. None but the\npurest and coldest of freestone will satisfy him.\"\n\nOnce when I was staying in a lumber camp on the Tennessee side, near the\ntop of Smoky, my friend Bob and I tramped down to the nearest town, ten\nmiles, for supplies. We did not start until after dinner and intended to\nspend the night at a hotel. It was a sultry day and we arrived very\nthirsty. Bob took some ice-water into his mouth, and instantly spat it\nout, exclaiming: \"Be damned if I'll stay here; that ain't fit to drink;\nI'm goin' back.\" And back he would have gone, ten miles up a hard grade,\nat night, if someone had not shown us a spring.\n\n\n[Illustration: Photo by Arthur Keith\n\nA misty veil of falling water]\n\n\nA little colony of our Hazel Creek people took a notion to try the\nGeorgia cotton mills. They nearly died there from homesickness, tight\nhouses, and \"bad water.\" All but one family returned as soon as they\npossibly could. While trying to save enough money to get away one old\nman said; \"I lied to my God when I left the mountains and kem to these\ndevilish cotton mills. Ef only He'd turn me into a varmint I'd run back\nto-night! Boys, I dream I'm in torment; an' when I wake up I lay thar\nan' think o' the spring branch runnin' over the root o' that thar\npoplar; an' I say, could I git me one drink o' that water I'd be content\nto lay me down and die!\"\n\nPoor old John! In his country there are a hundred spring branches\nrunning over poplar roots; but \"_that thar_ poplar\": we knew the very\none he meant. It was by the roadside. The brooklet came from a disused\nstill-house hidden in laurel and hemlock so dense that direct sunlight\nnever penetrated the glen. Cold and sparkling and crystal clear, the\ngushing water enticed every wayfarer to bend and drink, whether he was\nthirsty or no. John is back in his own land now, and doubtless often\ngoes to drink of that veritable fountain of youth.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nTHE LAND OF DO WITHOUT\n\n\nHomespun jeans and linsey used to be the universal garb of the mountain\npeople. Nowadays you will seldom find them, except in far-back places.\nShoddy \"store clothes\" are cheaper and easier to get. And this is a\nsorry change, for the old-time material was sound and enduring, the\ndirect product of hard personal toil, and so it was prized and taken\ncare of; whereas such stuff as a backwoodsman can buy in his crossroads\nstore is flimsy, soon loses shape and breaks down his own pride of\npersonal appearance. Our average hillsman now goes about in a dirty blue\nshirt, wapsy and ragged trousers toggled up with a nail or two, thick\nsocks sagging untidily over rusty brogans, and a huge, black, floppy hat\nthat desecrates the landscape. Presently his hatband disappears, to be\nreplaced with a groundhog thong, woven in and out of knife slits, like a\nshoestring.\n\nWhen he comes home he \"hangs his hat on the floor\" until his wife picks\nit up. He never brushes it. In time that battered old headpiece becomes\nas pliant to its owner's whim, as expressive of his mood, as a clown's\ncap in the circus. Commonly it is a symbol of shiftlessness and\nunconcern. A touch, and it becomes a banner of defiance to law and\norder. To meet on some lonesome road at night a horseman enveloped to\nthe heels in a black slicker and topped with one of those prodigious\nfunnels that conceals his features like a cowl, is to face the Ku Klux\nor the Spanish Inquisition.\n\nWhen your young mountaineer is properly filled up on corn liquor and\nfeels like challenging the world, the flesh, and the devil, he pins up\nthe front of his hat with a thorn, sticks a sprig of balsam or cedar in\nthe thong for an aigrette, and then gallops forth with bottle and pistol\nto tilt against whatsoever may dare oppose him. And on the gray dawn of\nthe morning after you may find _that hat_ lying wilted in a corner, as\ncrumpled, spiritless and forlorn as--its owner, upon whom we charitably\ndrop the curtain.\n\nI doubt, though, if anywhere in this wide world mere personal appearance\nis more deceitful than among our mountaineers. The slovenly lout whom\nyou shrink from approaching against the wind is one of the most\nindependent and self-satisfied fellows on earth, as quick to resent alms\nas to return a blow. And it is wonderful what soap and clean clothes\nwill do! About the worst specimen of tatter-demalion that I ever saw\noutside of trampdom used to come into town every week, always with a\nloaded Winchester on his shoulder. He may have washed his face now and\nthen, but there was no sign that he ever combed his mane. I took him for\none of those defectives alluded to in a previous chapter; but no, I was\ntold he was \"nobody's fool.\" The rifle, it was explained, never left his\nhand when he was abroad: they said that a feud was brewing \"over on\n'Larky,\" and that this man was \"in the bilin'.\" Well, it boiled over,\nand the person in question killed two men in front of his own door.\n\nWhen the prisoner was brought into court I could not recognize him. A\nbath, the barber, and a new store suit had transformed him into a right\ngood-looking fellow--anything but a tramp, anything but a desperado. He\nbore himself throughout that grilling ordeal like the downright man he\nwas, made out a clear case of self-defense, was set at liberty\nand--promptly reverted to a condition in which he is recognizable once\nmore.\n\nThe women of the back country usually go bareheaded around home and\noften barefooted, too, as did the daughters of Highland chiefs a century\nor two ago, and for the same reason: simply that they feel better so.\nWhen \"visit-in\" or expecting visitors their extremities are clad. They\nmake their own dresses and the style seems never to change. When\ntraveling horseback they use a man's saddle and ride astride in their\nordinary skirts with an ingenuity of \"tucking up\" that is beyond my\nunderstanding (as no doubt it should be). Often one sees a man and a\nwoman riding a-pillion, in which case the lady perches sidewise, of\ncourse.\n\nIf I were disposed to startle the reader, after the manner of\nimpressionistic writers who strive after effect at any cost, I could\nfill a book with oddities observed in the mountains, and that without\nexaggeration by commission or omission. Let one or two anecdotes\nsuffice; and then we will get back to our averages again. I took down\nthe following incident verbatim (save for proper names) from lips that I\nknow to be truthful. It is introduced here as a specimen of vivid\noffhand description in few words:\n\n\"There was a fam'ly on Pick-Yer-Flint that was named Higgins, and\nanother named the McBees. They married through and through till the\nwhole gineration nigh run out; though what helped was that they'd fly\nmad sometimes and kill one another like fools. They had great big heads\nand mottly faces--ears as big as sheepskins. Well, when they dressed up\nto come to church the men--grown men--'d have shirts made of this common\ndomestic, with the letters _AAA_ on their backs; and them barefooted,\nand some without hats, but with three yards of red ribbon around their\nnecks. The sleeves of their shirts looked like a whole web of cloth jest\nsewed up together; and them sleeves'd git full o' wind, and that red\nribbon a-flyin'--O my la!\n\n\"There was lots o' leetle boys of 'em that kem only in their\nshirt-tails. There was cracks between the logs that a dog could jump\nthrough, and them leetle fellers 'd git 'em a crack and grin in at us\nall through the sarmon. 'T ain't no manner o' use to ax me what the tex'\nwas that day!\"\n\nI may explain that it still is common in many districts of the mountain\ncountry for small boys to go about through the summer in a single\nabbreviated garment and that they are called \"shirt-tail boys.\"\n\nSome of the expedients that mountain girls invent to make themselves\nattractive are bizarre in the extreme. Without invading the sanctities\nof toilet, I will cite one instance that is interesting from a\nscientific viewpoint. They told me that a certain blue-eyed girl thought\nthat black eyes were \"purtier\" and that she actually changed her eyes to\njet black whenever she went to \"meetin'\" or other public gathering.\nWhile I could see how the trick might be worked, it seemed utterly\nabsurd that an unschooled maid of the wilderness could acquire either\nthe knowledge or the means to accomplish such change. Well, one day I\nwas called to treat a sick baby. While waiting for the medicine to react\nI chanced to mention this tale as it had been told me. The father, who\nhad blue eyes, solemnly assured me that there was \"no lie about it,\" and\nsaid he would convince me in a few minutes.\n\nHe stepped to the garden and plucked a leaf of jimson weed. His wife\ncrushed the leaf and instilled a drop of its juice into one of his eyes.\nI took out my watch. One side of the eyeball reddened slightly. The man\nsaid \"hit smarts a leetle--not much.\" Within fifteen minutes the pupil\nhad expanded like a cat's eye in the dark, leaving a rim of blue iris so\nthin as to be quite unnoticeable without close inspection. The eye\nconsequently was jet black and its expression utterly changed. My host\nsaid it did not affect his vision materially, save that \"things glimmer\na bit.\" I met him again the next day and he still was an odd-looking\ncreature indeed, with one eye a light blue and the other an absolute\nblack. The thing puzzled me until I recalled that the Latin name of\njimson weed is _Datura stramonium_; then, in a flash, it came to me that\nstramonium is a powerful mydriatic.\n\nIf our man killer, hitherto mentioned, had had blue or gray eyes and had\nnot chosen to stand trial, then, with a cake of soap and a new suit and\na jimson leaf he might have made himself over so that his own mother\nwould not have known him. These simple facts are offered gratis to\nwriters of detective tales, whose stock of disguises nowadays is so\nthreadbare and (pardon me) so absurd.\n\nThe mountain home of to-day is the log cabin of the American\npioneer--not such a lodge as well-to-do people affect in Adirondack\n\"camps\" (which cost more than framed structures of similar size), but a\npen that can be erected by four \"corner men\" in one day and is finished\nby the owner at his leisure. The commonest type is a single large room,\nwith maybe a narrow porch in front and a plank door, a big stone\nchimney at one end, a single sash for a window at the other, and a seven\nor eight-foot lean-to at the rear for kitchen.\n\n\n[Illustration: An Average Mountain Cabin]\n\n\nSome of the early settlers, who had first choice of land, took pains in\nbuilding their houses, squaring the logs like bridge timbers, joining\nthem closely, smoothing their puncheons with an adze almost as truly as\nif they were planed, and using mortar instead of clay in laying chimney\nand hearth. But such houses nowadays are rare. If a man can afford so\nmuch effort as all that he will build a framed dwelling. If not, he will\ncontent himself with such a cabin as I have described. If he prospers he\nmay add a duplicate of it alongside and cover the whole with one roof,\nleaving a ten or twelve-foot entry between.\n\nIn Carolina they seldom build a house of round logs, but rather hew the\ninner and outer faces flat, out of a curious notion that this adds an\nappearance of finish to the structure. If only they would turn the logs\nover, so that the flat faces joined, leaving at least the outside in the\nnatural round, the house would need hardly any chinking and the effect\nwould be far more pleasing to good taste. As it is they merely notch the\nlogs at the corners, leaving wide spaces to be filled up with splits,\nrocks, mud--anything to keep out the weather. As a matter of fact, few\nhouses ever are thoroughly chinked and he who would take pains to make a\nworkmanlike job of chinking would be ridiculed as \"fussin' around like\nan old granny-woman.\" Nobody but a tenderfoot feels drafts, you know.\n\nIt is hard to keep such a dwelling clean, even if the family be small.\nThe whole structure being built of green timber throughout, soon\nshrinks, checks, warps and sags, so that there cannot be a square joint,\na neat fit, a perpendicular face, or a level place anywhere about it.\nThe roof droops in a season or two, the shingles curl and leaky places\nopen. Flooring shrinks apart, leaving wide and irregular cracks through\nwhich the winter winds are sucked upward as through so many flues (no\nmountain home has a cellar under it). Everywhere there are crannies and\nrough surfaces to hold dust and soot, there being probably not a single\nplaned board in the whole house.\n\nBut, for all that, there is something very attractive and picturesque\nabout the little old log cabin. In its setting of ancient forests and\nmighty hills it fits, it harmonizes, where the prim and precise product\nof modern carpentry would shock an artistic eye. The very roughness of\nthe honest logs and the home-made furniture gives texture to the\npicture. Having no mathematically straight lines nor uniform curves, the\ncabin's outlines conform to its surroundings. Without artificial stain,\nor varnish, or veneer, it _is_ what it seems, a genuine thing, a jewel\nin the rough. And it is a home. When wind whistles through the cracks\nand snow sifts into the corners of the room one draws his stumpy little\nsplit-bottomed chair close to the wide hearth and really knows the\ncomfort of fire leaping and sap singing from big birch logs.\n\nEvery room except the kitchen (if there be a kitchen) has a couple of\nbeds in it: enough all told for the family and, generally, one spare\nbed. If much company comes, some pallets are made on the floor for the\nwomen and children of the household. In a single-room cabin there\nusually is a cockloft, reached by a ladder, for storage, and maybe a\nbunk or two. Closets and pantries there are none, for they would only\nfurnish good harborage for woods-rats and other vermin.\n\nEverything must be in sight and accessible to the housewife's little\nsedge broom. Linen and small articles of apparel are stored in a chest\nor a cheap little tin trunk or two. Most of the family wardrobe hangs\nfrom pegs in the walls or nails in the loft beams, along with strings\nof dried apples, peppers, bunches of herbs, twists of tobacco, gourds\nfull of seeds, the hunter's pouch, and other odd bric-a-brac interesting\nto \"furrin\" eyes. The narrow mantel-shelf holds pipes and snuff and\nvarious other articles of frequent use, among them a twig or two of\nsweet birch that has been chewed to shreds at one end and is queerly\ndiscolored with something brown (this is what the mountain woman calls\nher \"tooth brush\"--a snuff stick, understand).\n\nFor wall decorations there may be a few gaudy advertisements\nlithographed in colors, perhaps some halftones from magazines that\ntravelers have left (a magazine is always called a \"book\" in this\nregion, as, I think, throughout the South). Of late years the agents for\nphoto-enlarging companies have invaded the mountains and have reaped a\nharvest; for if there be one curse of civilization that our hillsman\ncraves, it is a huge _tinted_ \"family group\" in an abominable rococo\nframe.\n\nThere is an almanac in the cabin, but no clock. \"What does man need of a\nclock when he has a good-crowin' rooster?\" Strange as it may seem, in\nthis roughest of backwoods countries I have never seen candles, unless\nthey were brought in by outsiders like myself. Beef, you must remember,\nis exported, not eaten, by our farmers, and hence there is no tallow to\nmake candles with. Instead of these, every home is provided with a\nkerosene lamp of narrow wick, and seldom do you find a chimney for it.\nThis is partly because lamp chimneys are hard to carry safely over the\nmountain roads and partly because \"man can do without sich like,\nanyhow.\" But kerosene, also, is hard to transport, and so one sometimes\nwill find pine knots used for illumination; but oftener the woman will\npour hog's grease into a tin or saucer, twist up a bit of rag for the\nwick and so make a \"slut\" that, believe me, deserves the name. In fact,\nthe supply of pine knots within convenient distance of home is soon\nexhausted, and anyway, as the mountaineer disdains to be forehanded, he\nwould burn up the knots for kindling rather than save any for\nillumination.\n\nVery few cabins have carpet on the floor. It would hold too much mud\nfrom the feet of the men who would not use a scraper if there was one.\nBeds generally are bought, nowadays, at the stores, but some are\nhome-made, with bedcords of bast rope. Tables and chairs mostly are made\non the spot or obtained by barter from some handy neighbor. In many\nhomes you will still find the ancient spinning-wheel, with a hand-loom\non the porch and in the loft there will be a set of quilting frames for\nmaking \"kivers.\"\n\nOut in the yard you see an ash hopper for running the lye to make soap,\nmaybe a few bee gums sawed from hollow logs, and a crude but effective\ncider press. At the spring there is a box for cold storage in summer.\nNear by stands the great iron kettle for boiling clothes, making soap,\nscalding pigs, and a variety of other uses. Alongside of it is the\n\"battlin' block\" on which the family wash is hammered with a beetle\n(\"battlin' stick\") if the woman has no washboard, which very often is\nthe case.\n\nNaturally there can be no privacy and hence no delicacy, in such a home.\nI never will forget my embarrassment about getting to bed the first\nnight I ever spent in a one-room cabin where there was a good-sized\nfamily. I did not know what was expected of me. When everybody looked\nsleepy I went outdoors and strolled around in the moonlight until the\nwomen had time to retire. On returning to the house I found them still\nbolt upright around the hearth. Then the hostess pointed to the bed I\nwas to occupy and said it was ready whenever I was. Well, I \"shucked off\nmy clothes,\" tumbled in, turned my face to the wall, and immediately\neverybody else did the same. That is the way to do: just _go_ to bed! I\nlay there awake for a long time. Finally I had to roll over. A ruddy\nglow from the embers showed the family in all postures of deep, healthy\nslumber. It also showed something glittering on the nipple of the long,\nmuzzle-loading rifle that hung over the father's bed. It was a bright,\nnew percussion cap, where a greased rag had been when I went out for my\nmoonlight stroll. There was no need of a curtain in that house. They\ncould do without.\n\nI have been describing an average mountain home. In valleys and coves\nthere are better ones, of course. Along the railroads, and on fertile\nplateaus between the Blue Ridge and the Unakas, are hundreds of fine\nfarms, cultivated by machinery, and here dwell a class of farmers that\nare scarcely to be distinguished from people of similar station in the\nWest. But a prosperous and educated few are not the people. When\nspeaking of southern mountaineers I mean the mass, or the average, and\nthe pictures here given are typical of that mass. It is not the\nwell-to-do valley people, but the real mountaineers, who are especially\ninteresting to the reading public; and they are interesting _chiefly_\nbecause they preserve traits and manners that have been transmitted\nalmost unchanged from ancient times--because, as John Fox puts it, they\nare \"a distinct remnant of an Anglo-Saxon past.\"\n\nAlmost everywhere in the backwoods of Appalachia we have with us to-day,\nin flesh and blood, the Indian-fighter of our colonial border--aye, back\nof him, the half-wild clansman of elder Britain--adapted to other\nconditions, but still virtually the same in character, in ideas, in\nattitude toward the outer world. Here, in great part, is spoken to-day\nthe language of Piers the Ploughman, a speech long dead elsewhere, save\nas fragments survive in some dialects of rural England.\n\nNo picture of mountain life would be complete or just if it omitted a\nclass lower than the average hillsman I have been describing. As this is\nnot a pleasant topic, I shall be terse. Hundreds of backwoods families,\nlarge ones at that, exist in \"blind\" cabins that remind one somewhat of\nIrish hovels, Norwegian saeters, the \"black houses\" of the Hebrides, the\nwindowless rock piles inhabited by Corsican shepherds and by Basques of\nthe Pyrenees. Such a cabin has but one room for all purposes. In rainy\nor gusty weather, when the two doors must be closed, no light enters the\nroom save through cracks in the wall and down the chimney. In the\ndamp climate of western Carolina such an interior is fusty, or even wet.\nIn many cases the chimney is no more than a semi-circular pile of rough\nrocks and rises no higher than a man's shoulder, hence the common\nsaying, \"You can set by the fire and spit out through the chimbly.\" When\nthe wind blows \"contrary\" one's lungs choke and his eyes stream from the\nsmoke.\n\n\n[Illustration: A Bee-Gum]\n\n\nIn some of these places you will find a \"pet pig\" harbored in the house.\nI know of two cases where the pig was kept in a box directly under the\ntable, so that scraps could be chucked to him without rising from\ndinner.\n\nHastening from this extreme, we still shall find dire poverty the rule\nrather than the exception among the multitude of \"branch-water people.\"\nOne house will have only an earthen floor; another will be so small that\n\"you cain't cuss a cat in it 'thout gittin' ha'r in yer teeth.\" Utensils\nare limited to a frying-pan, an iron pot, a coffee-pot, a bucket, and\nsome gourds. There is not enough tableware to go around, and children\neat out of their parents' plates, or all \"soup-in together\" around one\nbowl of stew or porridge.\n\nEven to families that are fairly well-to-do there will come periods of\nfamine, such as Lincoln, speaking of his boyhood, called \"pretty\npinching times.\" Hickory ashes then are used as a substitute for soda in\nbiscuits, and the empty salt-gourd will be soaked for brine to cook\nwith. Once, when I was boarding with a good family, our stores ran out\nof everything, and none of our neighbors had the least to spare. We had\nno meat of any kind for two weeks (the game had migrated) and no lard or\nother grease for nearly a week. Then the meal and salt played out. One\nday we were reduced to potatoes \"straight,\" which were parboiled in\nfresh water, and then burnt a little on the surface as substitute for\nsalt. Another day we had not a bite but string beans boiled in unsalted\nwater.\n\nIt is not uncommon in the far backwoods for a traveler, asking for a\nmatch, to be told there is none in the house, nor even the pioneer's\nflint and steel. Should the embers on the hearth go out, someone must\ntramp to a neighbor's and fetch fire on a torch. Hence the saying: \"Have\nyou come to borry fire, that you're in sich a hurry you can't chat?\"\n\nThe shifts and expedients to which some of the mountain women are put,\nfrom lack of utensils and vessels, are simply pathetic. John Fox tells\nof a young preacher who stopped at a cabin in Georgia to pass the night.\n\"His hostess, as a mark of unusual distinction, killed a chicken, and\ndressed it in a pan. She rinsed the pan and made up her dough in it. She\nrinsed it again and went out and used it for a milk-pail. She came in,\nrinsed it again, and went to the spring and brought it back full of\nwater. She filled up the glasses on the table, and gave him the pan with\nthe rest of the water in which to wash his hands. The woman was not a\nslattern; it was the only utensil she had.\"\n\nSuch poverty is exceptional; yet it is an all but universal rule that\nanything that cannot be cooked in a pot or fried in a pan must go\nbegging in the mountains. Once I helped my hostess to make kraut. We\nchopped up a hundred pounds of cabbage with no cutter but a tin\ncoffee-can, holding this in the two hands and chopping downward with the\nedge. Many times I stopped to hammer the edge smooth on a round stick.\nVerily this is the land of make-it-yourself-or-do-without!\n\nYet, however destitute the mountain people may be, they are never\nabject. The mordant misery of hunger is borne with a sardonic grin.\nAfter a course of such diet as described above, a woman laughingly said\nto me: \"I'm gittin' the dropsy--the meat is all droppin' off my bones.\"\nDuring the campaign of 1904 a brother Democrat confided to me that \"The\npeople around hyur is so pore that if free silver war shipped in by the\ncarload, we-uns couldn't pay the freight.\" So, when a settlement is\ndubbed Poverty, it is with no suggestion of whining lament, but with the\nstoical good-humor that shows in Needmore, Poor Fork, Long Hungry, No\nPone, and No Fat--all of them real names.\n\nOccasionally, as at \"hog-killin' time,\" the poorest live in abundance;\noccasionally, as at Christmas, they will go on sprees. But, taking them\nthe year through, the Highlanders are a notably abstemious race. When a\nfamily is reduced to dry corn bread and black coffee unsweetened--so\nmuch and no more--it will joke about the lack of meat and vegetables.\nAnd, when there is meat, two mountaineers engaged in hard outdoor work\nwill consume less of it than a northern office-man would eat. Indeed,\nthe heartiness with which \"furriners\" stuff themselves is a wonder and a\nmerriment to the people of the hills. When a friend came to visit me,\nthe landlady giggled an aside to her husband: \"Git the almanick and see\nwhen that feller 'll full!\" (as though she were bidding him look to see\nwhen the moon would be full).\n\nIn truth, it is not so bad to be poor where everyone else is in the same\nfix. One does not lose caste nor self-respect. He is not tempted by a\ndisplay of good things all around him, nor is he embittered by the\nhaughtiness and extravagance of the rich. And, socially, the mountaineer\nis a democrat by nature: equal to any man, as all men are equal before\nhim. Even though hunger be eating like a slow acid into his vitals, he\nstill will preserve a high spirit, a proud independence, that accepts no\nfavor unless it be offered in a neighborly way, as man to man. I have\nnever seen a mountain beggar; never heard of one.\n\nCharity, or anything that smells to him like charity, is declined with\npatrician dignity or open scorn. In the last house up Hazel Creek dwelt\n\"old man\" Stiles. He had a large family, and was on the verge of\ndestitution. His eldest son, a veteran from the Philippines, had been\ninvalided home, and died there. Jack Coburn, in the kindness of his\nheart, sent away and got a blank form of application to the Government\nfor funeral expenses, to which the family was entitled by law. He filled\nit out, all but the signature, and rode away up to Stiles's to have the\nold man sign it. But Stiles peremptorily refused to accept from the\nnation what was due his dead son. \"I ain't that hard pushed yit,\" was\nhis first and last word on the subject. This might seem to be the very\nperversity of ignorance; but it was, in fact, renunciation on a point of\nhonor, and native pride refused to see the matter in any other light.\n\nThe mountaineer, born and bred to Spartan self-denial, has a scorn of\nluxury, regarding its effeminacies with the same contempt as does the\nnomadic Arab. And any assumption of superiority he will resent with blow\nor sarcasm. A ragged hobbledehoy stood on the Vanderbilt grounds at\nBiltmore, mouth open but silent, watching a gardener at work. The\nlatter, annoyed by the boy's vacuous stare, spoke up sharply: \"What do\nyou want?\" Like a flash the lad retorted: \"Oh, dad sent me down hyur to\nlook at the place--said if I liked it, he mought buy it for me.\"\n\nOnce, as an experiment, I took a backwoodsman from the Smokies to\nKnoxville, and put him up at a good hotel. Was he self-conscious,\nbashful? Not a bit of it. When the waiter brought him a juicy\ntenderloin, he snapped: \"I don't eat my meat raw!\" It was hard to find\nanything on the long menu that he would eat. On the street he held his\nhead proudly erect, and regarded the crowd with an expression of \"Tetch\nme gin ye dar!\" Although the surroundings were as strange to him as a\ncity of Mars would be to us, he showed neither concern nor approval,\nbut rather a fine disdain, like that of Diogenes at the country fair:\n\"Lord, how many things there be in this world of which Diogenes hath no\nneed!\"\n\nThe poverty of the mountain people is naked, but high-minded and\nunashamed. To comment on it, as I have done, is taken as an\nimpertinence. This is a fine trait, in its way, though rather hard on a\ndescriptive writer whose motives are ascribed to mere vulgarity and a\ntaste for scandal-mongering. The people, of course, have no ghost of an\nidea that poverty may be more picturesque than luxury; and they are\nquite as far from conceiving that a plain and friendly statement of\ntheir actual condition, published to the world, is the surest way to\nawaken the nation to consciousness of its duties toward a region that it\nhas so long and so singularly neglected.\n\nThe worst enemies of the mountain people are those public men who,\nknowing the true state of things, yet conceal or deny the facts in order\nto salve a sore local pride, encourage the supine fatalism of \"what must\nbe will be,\" and so drug the highlanders back into their Rip Van Winkle\nsleep.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nHOME FOLKS AND NEIGHBOR PEOPLE\n\n\nDespite the low standard of living that prevails in the backwoods, the\naverage mountain home is a happy one, as homes go. There is little worry\nand less fret. Nobody's nerves are on edge. Our highlander views all\nexigencies of life with the calm fortitude and tolerant good-humor of\nBret Harte's southwesterner, \"to whom cyclones, famine, drought, floods,\npestilence and savages were things to be accepted, and whom disaster, if\nit did not stimulate, certainly did not appall.\"\n\nIt is a patriarchal existence. The man of the house is lord. He takes no\norders from anybody at home or abroad. Whether he shall work or visit or\nroam the woods with dog and gun is nobody's affair but his own. About\nfamily matters he consults with his wife, but in the end his word is\nlaw. If Madame be a bit shrewish he is likely to tolerate it as natural\nto the weaker vessel; but if she should go too far he checks her with a\ncurt \"Shet up!\" and the incident is closed.\n\n\"The woman,\" as every wife is called, has her kingdom within the house,\nand her man seldom meddles with its administration. Now and then he may\ngrumble \"A woman's allers findin' somethin' to do that a man can't see\nno sense in;\" but, then, the Lord made women fussy over trifles--His\nways are inscrutable--so why bother about it?\n\nThe mountain farmer's wife is not only a household drudge, but a\nfield-hand as well. She helps to plant, hoes corn, gathers fodder,\nsometimes even plows or splits rails. It is the commonest of sights for\na woman to be awkwardly hacking up firewood with a dull axe. When her\nman leaves home on a journey he is not likely to have laid in wood for\nthe stove or hearth: so she and the children must drag from the\nhillsides whatever dead timber they can find.\n\nOutside the towns no hat is lifted to maid or wife. A swain would\nconsider it belittled his dignity. At table, if women be seated at all,\nthe dishes are passed first to the men; but generally the wife stands by\nand serves. There is no conscious discourtesy in such customs; but they\nbetoken an indifference to woman's weakness, a disregard for her finer\nnature, a denial of her proper rank, that are real and deep-seated in\nthe mountaineer. To him she is little more than a sort of superior\ndomestic animal. The chivalric regard for women that characterized our\npioneers of the Far West is altogether lacking in the habits of the\nbackwoodsman of Appalachia.\n\nAnd yet it is seldom that a highland woman complains of her lot. She\nknows no other. From aboriginal times the men of her race have been\nwarriors, hunters, herdsmen, clearers of forests, and their women have\ntoiled in the fields. Indeed she would scarce respect her husband if he\ndid not lord it over her and cast upon her the menial tasks. It is\n\"manners\" for a woman to drudge and obey. All respectable wives do that.\nAnd they stay at home where they belong, never visiting or going\nanywhere without first asking their husband's consent.\n\nI am satisfied that there is less bickering in mountain households than\nin the most advanced society of Christendom. Certainly there are fewer\ndivorces in proportion to the marriages. This is not by grace of any\nuncommon regard for the seventh commandment, but rather from a more\ntolerant attitude of mind.\n\nMountain women marry early, many of them at fourteen or fifteen, and\nnearly all before they are twenty. Large families are the rule, seven\nto ten children being considered normal, and fifteen is not an uncommon\nnumber; but the infant mortality is high.\n\nThe children have few toys other than rag dolls, broken bits of crockery\nfor \"play-purties,\" and such \"ridey-hosses\" and so forth as they make\nfor themselves. They play few games, but rather frisk about like young\ncolts without aim or method. Every mountain child has at least one dog\nfor a playfellow, and sometimes a pet pig is equally familiar. In many\ndistricts there is not enough level land for a ballground. A prime\namusement of the small boys is \"rocking\" (throwing stones at marks or at\neach other), in which rather doubtful pastime they become singularly\nexpert.\n\nTo encourage a child to do chores about the house and stable, he may be\npromised a pig of his own the next time a sow litters. To know when to\nlook for the pigs an expedient is practiced that I never heard of\nelsewhere: the child bores a small hole at the base of his thumbnail. I\nwas assured by a mountain preacher that the hole \"will grow out to the\nedge of the nail in three months and twenty-four days\"--the period, he\nsaid, of a sow's gestation (in reality the average term is about three\nmonths).\n\nMost mountaineers are indulgent, super-indulgent parents. The oft-heard\nthreat \"I'll w'ar ye out with a hick'ry!\" is seldom carried out. The\nboys, especially, grow up with little restraint beyond their own natural\nsense of filial duty. Little children are allowed to eat and drink\nanything they want--green fruit, adulterated candy, fresh cider, no\nmatter what--to the limit of repletion; and fatal consequences are not\nrare. I have observed the very perversity of license allowed children,\nsimilar to what Julian Ralph tells of a man on Bullskin Creek, who,\nexplaining why his child died, said that \"No one couldn't make her take\nno medicine; she just wouldn't take it; she was a Baker through and\nthrough, and you never could make a Baker do nothin' he didn't want to!\"\n\nThe saddest spectacle in the mountains is the tiny burial-ground,\nwithout a headstone or headboard in it, all overgrown with weeds, and\nperhaps unfenced, with cattle grazing over the low mounds or sunken\ngraves. The spot seems never to be visited between interments. I have\nremarked elsewhere that most mountaineers are singularly callous in the\npresence of serious injury or death. They show a no less remarkable lack\nof reverence for the dead. Nothing on earth can be more poignantly\nlonesome than one of these mountain burial-places, nothing so mutely\nevident of neglect.\n\nFuneral services are extremely simple. In the backwoods, where lumber is\nscarce, a coffin will be knocked together from rough planks taken from\nsomeone's loft, or out of puncheons hewn from the green trees. It is\nslung on poles and carried like a litter. The only exercises at the\ngrave are singing and praying; and sometimes even those are omitted, as\nin case no preacher can be summoned in time.\n\nIn all back settlements that I have visited, from Kentucky southward,\nthere is a strange custom as to the funeral sermon, that seems to have\nno analogue elsewhere. It is not preached until long after the\ninterment, maybe a year or several years. In some districts the practice\nis to hold joint services, at the same time and place, for all in the\nneighborhood who died within the year. The time chosen will be after the\ncrops are gathered, so that everybody can attend. In other places a\nhusband's funeral sermon is postponed until his wife dies, or _vice\nversa_, though the interval may be many years. These collective funeral\nservices last two or three days, and are attended by hundreds of people,\nlike a camp-meeting.\n\nStrange scenes sometimes are witnessed at the graveside, prompted\nperhaps by weird superstitions. At one of our burials, which was\nattended by more than the usual retinue of kinsfolk, there were present\ntwo mothers who bore each other the deadliest hate that women know. Each\nhad a child at her breast. When the clods fell, they silently exchanged\nbabies long enough for each to suckle her rival's child. Was it a\nreconciliation cemented by the very life of their blood? Or was it a\ncharm to keep off evil spirits? No one could (or would) explain it to\nme.\n\nWeddings never are celebrated in church, but at the home of the bride,\nand are jolly occasions, of course. Often the young men, stimulated with\nmore or less \"moonshine,\" add the literally stunning compliment of a\nshivaree.\n\nThe mountaineers have a native fondness for music and dancing, which,\nwith the shouting-spells of their revivals, are the only outlets for\nthose powerful emotions which otherwise they studiously conceal. The\nharmony of \"part singing\" is unknown in the back districts, where men\nand women both sing in a jerky treble. Most of their music is in the\nweird, plaintive minor key that seems spontaneous with primitive people\nthroughout the world. Not only the tone, but the sentiment of their\nhymns and ballads is usually of a melancholy nature, expressing the\nwrath of God and the doom of sinners, or the luckless adventures of wild\nblades and of maidens all forlorn. A Highlander might well say, with the\nclown in _A Winter's Tale_, \"I love a ballad but even too well; if it be\ndoleful matter, merrily set down, or a very pleasant thing indeed, and\nsung lamentably.\"\n\nBut where banjo and fiddle enter, the vapors vanish. Up strike The Fox\nChase, Shady Grove, Gamblin' man, Sourwood Mountain, and knees are\nlimbered, and merry voices rise.--\n\n  Call up your dog, O call up your dog!\n    Call up your dog!\n    Call up your dog!\n  Let 's a-go huntin' to ketch a groundhog.\n    Rang tang a-whaddle linky day!\n\n\nWherever the church has not put its ban on \"twistifications\" the country\ndance is the chief amusement of young and old. I have never succeeded in\nmemorizing the queer \"calls\" at these dances, in proper order, and so\ntake the liberty of quoting from Mr. Haney's _Mountain People of\nKentucky_.--\n\n     \"Eight hands up and go to the left; half and back; corners turn;\n     partners sash-i-ate. First four, forwards and back; forward again\n     and cross over; forward and back and home you go. Gents stand and\n     ladies swing in the center; own partners and half sash-i-ate.\n\n     \"Eight hands and gone again; half and back; partners by the right\n     and opposite by the left--sash-i-ate. Right hands across and howdy\n     do? Left and back and how are you? Opposite partners, half\n     sash-i-ate and go to the next (and so on for each couple).\n\n     \"All hands up and go to the left. Hit the floor. Corners turn and\n     sash-i-ate. First couple cage the bird with three arms around. Bird\n     hop out and hoot-owl in; three arms around and hootin' agin. Swing\n     and circle four, ladies change and gents the same; right and left;\n     the shoo-fly swing (and so on for each couple).\"\n\n\nIn homes where dancing is not permitted, and often in others,\n\"play-parties\" are held, at which social games are practiced with\nchildlike abandon: Roll the Platter, Weavilly Wheat, Needle's Eye, We\nFish Who Bite, Grin an' Go 'Foot, Swing the Cymblin, Skip t' m' Lou\n(pronounced \"Skip-tum a-loo\") and many others of a rollicking,\nhalf-dancing nature.\n\n  Round the house; skip t' m' Lou, my darlin'.\n  Steal my partner and I'll steal again; skip (etc.).\n  Take her and go with her--I don't care; skip (etc.).\n  I can get another as pretty as you; skip (etc.).\n  Pretty as a red-bird, and prettier too; skip (etc.).\n\n\nA substitute for the church fair is the \"poke-supper,\" at which dainty\npokes (bags) of cake and other home-made delicacies are auctioned off\nto the highest bidder. Whoever bids-in a poke is entitled to eat with\nthe girl who prepared it, and escort her home. The rivalry excited among\nthe mountain swains by such artful lures may be judged from the fact\nthat, in a neighborhood where a man's work brings only a dollar a day, a\npretty girl's poke may be bid up to ten, twenty, or even fifty dollars.\n\n\n[Illustration: Let the women do the work]\n\n\nAs a rule, the only holidays observed in the mountains, outside the\ntowns, are Christmas and New Year's. Christmas is celebrated after the\nsouthern fashion, which seems bizarre indeed to one witnessing it for\nthe first time. The boys and men, having no firecrackers (which they\nwould disdain, anyway), go about shooting revolvers and drinking to the\nlimit of capacity or supply. Blank cartridges are never used in this\nuproarious jollification, and the courses of the bullets are left to\nchance, so that discreet people keep their noses indoors. Christmas is a\nday of license, of general indulgence, it being tacitly assumed that\npunishment is remitted for any ordinary sins of the flesh that may be\ncommitted on that day. There is no church festivity, nor are Christmas\ntrees ever set up. Few mountain children hang up their stockings, and\nmany have never heard of Santa Claus.\n\nNew Year's Day is celebrated with whatever effervescence remains from\nChristmas, and in the same manner; but generally it is a feeble\nreminder, as the liquid stimulus has run short and there are many sore\nheads in the neighborhood.\n\nMost of the mountain preachers nowadays denounce dances and\n\"play-parties\" as sinful diversions, though their real objection seems\nto be that such gatherings are counter-attractions that thin out the\nreligious ones. Be that as it may, they certainly have put a damper on\nfrolics, so that in very many mountain settlements \"goin' to meetin'\" is\nrecognized primarily as a social function and affords almost the only\nchance for recreation in which family can join family without restraint.\n\nMeetings are held in the log schoolhouse. The congregation ranges\nitself, men on one side, women on the other, on rude benches that\nsometimes have no backs. Everybody goes. If one judged from attendance\nhe would rate our highlanders as the most religious people in America.\nThis impression is strengthened, in a stranger, by the grave and\nastoundingly patient attention that is given an illiterate or nearly\nilliterate minister while he holds forth for two or three mortal hours\non the beauties of predestination, free-will, foreordination,\nimmersion, foot-washing, or on the delinquencies of \"them acorn-fed\ncritters that has gone New Light over in Cope's Cove.\"\n\nAfter an _al fresco_ lunch, everybody doggedly returns to hear another\ncircuit-rider expound and denounce at the top of his voice until late\nafternoon--as long as \"the spirit lasts\" and he has \"good wind.\" When he\nwarms up, he throws in a gasping _ah_ or _uh_ at short intervals, which\nconstitutes the \"holy tone.\" Doctor MacClintock gives this example: \"Oh,\nbrethren, repent ye, and repent ye of your sins, ah; fer if ye don't ah,\nthe Lord, ah, he will grab yer by the seat of yer pants, ah, and held\nyer over hell fire till ye holler like a coon!\"\n\nDuring these services there is a good deal of running in and out by the\nmen and boys, most of whom gradually congregate on the outside to\nwhittle, gossip, drive bargains, and debate among themselves some point\nof dogma that is too good to keep still about.\n\nNearly all of our highlanders, from youth upward, show an amazing\nfondness for theological dispute. This consists mainly in capping texts,\ninstead of reasoning, with the single-minded purpose of confusing or\ndowning an opponent. Into this battle of memories rather than of wits\nthe most worthless scapegrace will enter with keen gusto and perfect\nseriousness. I have known two or three hundred mountain lumber-jacks,\nhard-swearing and hard-drinking tough-as-they-make-'ems, to be whetted\nto a fighting edge over the rocky problem \"Was Saul damned?\" (Can a\nsuicide enter the kingdom of heaven?)\n\nThe mountaineers are intensely, universally Protestant. You will seldom\nfind a backwoodsman who knows what a Roman Catholic is. As John Fox\nsays, \"He is the only man in the world whom the Catholic Church has made\nlittle or no effort to proselyte. Dislike of Episcopalianism is still\nstrong among people who do not know, or pretend not to know, what the\nword means. 'Any Episcopalians around here?' asked a clergyman at a\nmountain cabin. 'I don't know,' said the old woman. 'Jim's got the skins\nof a lot o' varmints up in the loft. Mebbe you can find one up thar.'\"\n\nThe first settlers of Appalachia mainly were Presbyterians, as became\nScotch-Irishmen, but they fell away from that faith, partly because the\nwilderness was too poor to support a regular ministry, and partly\nbecause it was too democratic for Calvinism with its supreme authority\nof the clergy. This much of seventeenth century Calvinism the\nmountaineer retains: a passion for hair-splitting argument over points\nof doctrine, and the cocksure intolerance of John Knox; but the\nancestral creed itself has been forgotten.\n\nThe circuit-rider, whether Methodist or Baptist, found here a field ripe\nfor his harvest. Being himself self-supporting and unassuming, he won\neasily the confidence of the people. He preached a highly emotional\nreligion that worked his audience into the ecstasy that all primitive\npeople love. And he introduced a mighty agent of evangelization among\noutdoor folk when he started the camp-meeting.\n\nThe season for camp-meetings is from mid-August to October. The festival\nmay last a week in one place. It is a jubilee-week to the work-worn and\nhome-chained women, their only diversion from a year of unspeakably\nmonotonous toil. And for the young folks, it is their theater, their\ncircus, their county fair. (I say this with no disrespect: \"big-meetin'\ntime\" is a gala week, if there be any such thing at all in the\nmountains--its attractiveness is full as much secular as spiritual to\nthe great body of the people.)\n\nIt is a camp by day only, or up to closing time. No mountaineer owns a\ntent. Preachers and exhorters are housed nearby, and visitors from all\nthe country scatter about with their friends, or sleep in the open,\ncooking their meals by the wayside.\n\nIn these backwoods revival meetings we can witness to-day the weird\nphenomena of ungovernable shouting, ecstasy, bodily contortions, trance,\ncatalepsy, and other results of hypnotic suggestion and the contagious\none-mindedness of an overwrought crowd. This is called \"taking a big\nthrough,\" and is regarded as the madness of supernatural joy. It is a\nmild form of that extraordinary frenzy which swept the Kentucky\nsettlements in 1800, when thousands of men and women at the\ncamp-meetings fell victims to \"the jerks,\" \"barking exercises,\" erotic\nvagaries, physical wreckage, or insanity, to which the frenzy led.\n\nMany mountaineers are easily carried away by new doctrines extravagantly\npresented. Religious mania is taken for inspiration by the superstitious\nwho are looking for \"signs and wonders.\" At one time Mormon prophets\nlured women from the backwoods of western Carolina and eastern\nTennessee. Later there was a similar exodus of people to the\nCastellites, a sect of whom it was commonly remarked that \"everybody who\njoins the Castellites goes crazy.\" In our day the same may be said of\nthe Holy Rollers and Holiness People.\n\nIn a feud town of eastern Kentucky, not long ago, I saw two Holiness\nexhorters prancing before a solemnly attentive crowd in the court-house\nsquare, one of them shouting and exhibiting the \"holy laugh,\" while the\nother pointed to the Cumberland River and cried, \"I don't say _if_ I had\nthe faith, I say I _have_ the faith, to walk over that river dry-shod!\"\nI scanned the crowd, and saw nothing but belief, or willingness to\nbelieve, on any countenance. Of course, most mountaineers are more\nintelligent than that; but few of them are free from superstitions of\none kind or other. There are to-day many believers in witchcraft among\nthem (though none own it to any but their intimates) and nearly\neverybody in the hills has faith in portents.\n\nThe mountain clergy, as a general rule, are hostile to \"book larnin',\"\nfor \"there ain't no Holy Ghost in it.\" One of them who had spent three\nmonths at a theological school told President Frost, \"Yes, the seminary\nis a good place ter go and git rested up, but 'tain't worth while fer me\nter go thar no more 's long as I've got good wind.\"\n\nIt used to amuse me to explain how I knew that the earth was a sphere;\nbut one day, when I was busy, a tiresome old preacher put the\neverlasting question to me: \"Do you believe the yearth is round?\" An\nimpish perversity seized me and I answered, \"No--all blamed humbug!\"\n\"Amen!\" cried my delighted catechist, \"I knowed in reason you had more\nsense.\"\n\nIn general the religion of the mountaineers has little influence on\nevery-day behavior, little to do with the moral law. Salvation is by\nfaith alone, and not by works. Sometimes a man is \"churched\" for\nbreaking the Sabbath, \"cussin',\" \"tale-bearin'\"; but sins of the flesh\nare rarely punished, being regarded as amiable frailties of mankind. It\nshould be understood that the mountaineer's morals are \"all tail-first,\"\nlike those of Alan Breck in Stevenson's _Kidnapped_.\n\nOne of our old-timers nonchalantly admitted in court that he and a\npreacher had marked a false corner-tree which figured in an important\nland suit. On cross-examination he was asked:\n\n\"You admit that you and Preacher X---- forged that corner-tree? Didn't\nyou give Preacher X---- a good character, in your testimony? Do you\nconsider it consistent with his profession as a minister of the Gospel\nto forge corner-trees?\"\n\n\"Aw,\" replied the witness, \"religion ain't got nothin' to do with\ncorner-trees!\"\n\nJohn Fox relates that, \"A feud leader who had about exterminated the\nopposing faction, and had made a good fortune for a mountaineer while\ndoing it, for he kept his men busy getting out timber when they weren't\nfighting, said to me in all seriousness:\n\n\"'I have triumphed agin my enemies time and time agin. The Lord's on my\nside, and I gits a better and better Christian ever' year.'\n\n\"A preacher, riding down a ravine, came upon an old mountaineer hiding\nin the bushes with his rifle.\n\n\"'What are you doing there, my friend?'\n\n\"'Ride on, stranger,' was the easy answer. 'I'm a-waitin' fer Jim\nJohnson, and with the help of the Lawd I'm goin' to blow his damn head\noff.'\"\n\nBut let us never lose sight of the fact that these people,\nintellectually, are not living in our age. To judge them fairly we must\ngo back and get a medieval point of view, which, by the way, persisted\nin Europe and America until well into the Georgian period. If history be\ntoo dry, read Stevenson's _Kidnapped_, and especially its sequel _David\nBalfour_, to learn what that viewpoint was. The parallel is so\nclose--eighteenth century Britain and twentieth century\nAppalachia--that here we walk the same paths with Alan and David, the\nEdinboro' law-sharks, Katriona and Lady Allardyce. The only difference\nof moment is that we have no aristocracy.\n\nAs for the morals of our highlanders, they are precisely what any\nwell-read person would expect after taking their belatedness into\nconsideration. In speech and conduct, when at ease among themselves,\nthey are frank, old-fashioned Englishmen and Scots, such as Fielding and\nSmollet and Pepys and Burns have shown us to the life. Their manners are\nboorish, of course, judged by a feminized modern standard, and their\nhome conversation is as coarse as the mixed-company speeches in\nShakespeare's comedies or the offhand pleasantries of Good Queen Bess.\n\nBut what is refinement? What is morality?\n\n\"I don't mind,\" said the Belov\u00c3\u00a9d Vagabond, \"I don't mind the frank\ndungheap outside a German peasant's kitchen window; but what I loathe\nand abominate is the dungheap hidden beneath Hedwige's draper papa's\nparlor floor.\" And we do well to consider that fine remark by Sir Oliver\nLodge: \"Vice is reversion to a lower type _after perception of a\nhigher_.\"\n\nI have seen the worst as well as the best of Appalachia. There _are_\n\"places on Sand Mountain\"--scores of them--where unspeakable orgies\nprevail at times. But I know that between these two extremes the great\nmass of the mountain people are very like persons of similar station\nelsewhere, just human, with human frailties, only a little more honest,\nI think, in owning them. And even in the tenebra of far-back coves,\nwhere conditions exist as gross as anything to be found in the wynds and\ncloses of our great cities, there is this blessed difference: that these\nhalf-wild creatures have not been hopelessly submerged, have not been\ndriven into desperate war against society. The worst of them still have\ngood traits, strong characters, something responsive to decent\ntreatment. They are kind-hearted, loyal to their friends, quick to help\nanyone in distress. They know nothing of civilization. They are simply\n_the unstarted_--and their thews are sound.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nTHE MOUNTAIN DIALECT\n\n\nOne day I handed a volume of John Fox's stories to a neighbor and asked\nhim to read it, being curious to learn how those vivid pictures of\nmountain life would impress one who was born and bred in the same\natmosphere. He scanned a few lines of the dialogue, then suddenly stared\nat me in amazement.\n\n\"What's the matter with it?\" I asked, wondering what he could have found\nto startle him at the very beginning of a story.\n\n\"Why, that feller _don't know how to spell_!\"\n\nGravely I explained that dialect must be spelled as it is pronounced, so\nfar as possible, or the life and savor of it would be lost. But it was\nof no use. My friend was outraged. \"That tale-teller then is jest makin'\nfun of the mountain people by misspellin' our talk. You educated folks\ndon't spell your own words the way you say them.\"\n\nA most palpable hit; and it gave me a new point of view.\n\nTo the mountaineers themselves their speech is natural and proper, of\ncourse, and when they see it bared to the spotlight, all eyes drawn\ntoward it by an orthography that is as odd to them as it is to us, they\nare stirred to wrath, just as we would be if our conversation were\nreported by some Josh Billings or Artemas Ward.\n\nThe curse of dialect writing is elision. Still, no one can write it\nwithout using the apostrophe more than he likes to; for our highland\nspeech is excessively clipped. \"I'm comin' d'reck'ly\" has a quaintness\nthat should not be lost. We cannot visualize the shambling but eager\nmountaineer with a sample of ore in his hand unless the writer reports\nhim faithfully: \"Wisht you'd 'zamine this rock fer me--I heern tell you\nwas one o' them 'sperts.\"\n\nAlthough the hillsmen save some breath in this way, they waste a good\ndeal by inserting sounds where they do not belong. Sometimes it is only\nan added consonant: gyarden, acrost, corkus (caucus); sometimes a\nsyllable: loaferer, musicianer, suddenty. Occasionally a word is both\nadded to and clipped from, as cyarn (carrion). They are fond of grace\nsyllables: \"I gotta me a deck o' cyards.\" \"There ain't nary bitty sense\nin it.\"\n\nMore interesting are substitutions of one sound for another. In mountain\ndialect all vowels may be interchanged with others. Various sounds of\n_a_ are confused with _e_, as hed (had), kem (came), keerful; or with\n_i_, grit (grate), rifle (raffle); with _o_, pomper, toper (taper),\nwrop; or with _u_, fur, ruther. So any other vowel may serve in place of\n_e_: sarve, chist, upsot, tumble. Any other may displace _i_: arn\n(iron), eetch, hender, whope or whup. The _o_ sounds are more stable,\nbut we have crap (crop), yan, clus, and many similar variants. Any other\nvowel may do for _u_: braysh or bresh (brush), shet, sich, shore (sure).\n\nMountaineers have peculiar difficulty with diphthongs: haar (hair),\ncheer (chair), brile, and a host of others. The word coil is variously\npronounced quile, querl or quorl.\n\nSubstitution of consonants is not so common as of vowels, but most\nhillsmen say nabel (navel), ballet (ballad), Babtis', rench or rinch,\nbrickie (brittle), and many say atter or arter, jue (due), tejus,\nvascinator (fascinator--a woman's scarf). They never drop _h_, nor\nsubstitute anything for it.\n\nThe word woman has suffered some strange sea-changes. Most mountaineers\npronounce it correctly, but some drop the _w_ ('oman), others add an\n_r_ (womern and wimmern), while in Michell County, North Carolina, we\nhear the extraordinary forms ummern and dummern (\"La, look at all the\ndummerunses a-comin'!\")\n\nOn the other hand, some words that most Americans mispronounce are\nalways sounded correctly in the southern highlands, as dew and new\n(never doo, noo). Creek is always given its true _ee_ sound, never\ncrick. Nare (as we spell it in dialect stories) is simply the right\npronunciation of ne'er, and nary is ne'er a, with the _a_ turned into a\nshort _i_ sound.\n\nIt should be understood that the dialect varies a good deal from place\nto place, and, even in the same neighborhood, we rarely hear all\nfamilies speaking it alike. Outlanders who essay to write it are prone\nto err by making their characters speak it too consistently. It is only\nin the backwoods, or among old people and the penned-at-home women, that\nthe dialect is used with any integrity. In railroad towns we hear little\nof it, and farmers who trade in those towns adapt their speech somewhat\nto the company they may be in. The same man, at different times, may say\ncan't and cain't, set and sot, jest and jes' and jist, atter and arter\nor after, seed and seen, here and hyur and hyar, heerd and heern or\nheard, sich and sech, took and tuk--there is no uniformity about it. An\nunconscious sense of euphony seems to govern the choice of hit or it,\nthere or thar.\n\nSince the Appalachian people have a marked Scotch-Irish strain, we would\nexpect their speech to show a strong Scotch influence. So far as\nvocabulary is concerned, there is really little of it. A few words,\ncaigy (cadgy), coggled, fernent, gin for if, needcessity, trollop,\nalmost exhaust the list of distinct Scotticisms. The Scotch-Irish, as we\ncall them, were mainly Ulstermen, and the Ulster dialect of to-day bears\nlittle analogy to that of Appalachia.\n\nScotch influence does appear, however, in one vital characteristic of\nthe pronunciation: with few exceptions our highlanders sound _r_\ndistinctly wherever it occurs, though they never trill it. In the\nBritish Isles this constant sounding of _r_ in all positions is\npeculiar, I think, to Scotland, Ireland, and a few small districts in\nthe northern border counties of England. With us it is general practice\noutside of New England and those parts of the southern lowlands that had\nno flood of Celtic immigration in the eighteenth century. I have never\nheard a Carolina mountaineer say niggah or No'th Ca'lina, though in the\nlast word the syllable _ro_ is often elided.\n\nIn some mountain districts we hear do' (door), flo', mo', yo', co'te,\nsca'ce (long _a_), pusson; but such skipping of the _r_ is common only\nwhere lowland influence has crept in. Much oftener the _r_ is dropped\nfrom dare, first, girl, horse, nurse, parcel, worth (dast, fust, gal,\nhoss, nuss, passel, wuth). By way of compensation the hillsmen sometimes\ninsert a euphonic _r_ where it has no business; just as many New\nEnglanders say, \"The idear of it!\"\n\nThroughout Appalachia such words as last, past, advantage, are\npronounced with the same vowel sound as is heard in man. This helps to\ndelimit the people, classifying them with Pennsylvanians and Westerners:\na linguistic grouping that will prove significant when we come to study\nthe origin and history of this isolated race.\n\nAn editor who had made one or two short trips into the mountains once\nwrote me that he thought the average mountaineer's vocabulary did not\nexceed three hundred words. This may be a natural inference if one\nspends but a few weeks among these people and sees them only under the\nprosaic conditions of workaday life. But gain their intimacy and you\nshall find that even the illiterates among them have a range of\nexpression that is truly remarkable. I have myself taken down from the\nlips of Carolina mountaineers some eight hundred dialectical or\nobsolete words, to say nothing of the much greater number of standard\nEnglish terms that they command.\n\nSeldom is a \"hill-billy\" at a loss for a word. Lacking other means of\nexpression, there will come \"spang\" from his mouth a coinage of his own.\nInstantly he will create (always from English roots, of course) new\nwords by combination, or by turning nouns into verbs or otherwise\ninterchanging the parts of speech.\n\nCrudity or deficiency of the verb characterizes the speech of all\nprimitive peoples. In mountain vernacular many words that serve as verbs\nare only nouns of action, or adjectives, or even adverbs. \"That bear 'll\nmeat me a month.\" \"They churched Pitt for tale-bearin'.\" \"Granny kept\nfaultin' us all day.\" \"Are ye fixin' to go squirrelin'?\" \"Sis blouses\nher waist a-purpose to carry a pistol.\" \"My boy Jesse book-kept for the\ncamp.\" \"I disgust bad liquor.\" \"This poke salat eats good.\" \"I ain't\ngoin' to bed it no longer\" (lie abed). \"We can muscle this log up.\" \"I\nwouldn't pleasure them enough to say it.\" \"Josh ain't much on\nsweet-heartin'.\" \"I don't confidence them dogs much.\" \"The creek away up\nthar turkey-tails out into numerous leetle forks.\"\n\nA verb will be coined from an adverb: \"We better git some wood, bettern\nwe?\" Or from an adjective: \"Much that dog and see won't he come along\"\n(pet him, make much of him). \"I didn't do nary thing to contrary her.\"\n\"Baby, that onion 'll strong ye!\" \"Little Jimmy fell down and benastied\nhimself to beat the devil.\"\n\nConversely, nouns are created from verbs. \"Hit don't make no differ.\" \"I\ndidn't hear no give-out at meetin'\" (announcement). \"You can git ye one\nmore gittin' o' wood up thar.\" \"That Nantahala is a master shut-in, jest\na plumb gorge.\" Or from an adjective: \"Them bugs--the little old\nhatefuls!\" \"If anybody wanted a history of this county for fifty years\nhe'd git a lavish of it by reading that mine-suit testimony.\" Or from an\nadverb: \"Nance tuk the biggest through at meetin'!\" (shouting spell). An\nold lady quoted to me in a plaintive quaver:\n\n  \"It matters not, so I've been told,\n  Where the body goes when the heart grows cold;\n\n\"But,\" she added, \"a person has a rather about where he'd be put.\"\n\nIn mountain vernacular the Old English strong past tense still lives in\nbegun, drunk, holped, rung, shrunk, sprung, stunk, sung, sunk, swum.\nHolp is used both as preterite and as infinitive: the _o_ is long, and\nthe _l_ distinctly sounded by most of the people, but elided by such as\ndrop it from almost, already, self (the _l_ is elided from help by many\nwho use that form of the verb).\n\nExamples of a strong preterite with dialectical change of the vowel are\nbruk, brung, drap or drapped, drug, friz, roke or ruck (raked), saunt\n(sent), shet, shuck (shook), whoped (long _o_). The variant whupped is a\nScotticism. Whope is sometimes used in the present tense, but whup is\nmore common. By some the vowel of whup is sounded like _oo_ in book (Mr.\nFox writes \"whoop,\" which, I presume, he intends for that sound).\n\nIn many cases a weak preterite supplants the proper strong one: div,\ndriv, fit, gi'n or give, rid, riv, riz, writ, done, run, seen or seed,\nblowed, crowed, drawed, growed, knowed, throwed.\n\nThere are many corrupt forms of the verb, such as gwine for gone or\ngoing, mought (mowt) for might, dim, het, ort or orter, wed (weeded),\nwar (was or were--the _a_ as in far), shun (shone), cotch (in all\ntenses) or cotched, fotch or fotched, borned, hurted, dremp.\n\nPeculiar adjectives are formed from verbs. \"Chair-bottoming is easy\nsettin'-down work.\" \"When my youngest was a leetle set-along child\"\n(interpreted as \"settin' along the floor\"). \"That Thunderhead is the\ntorndowndest place!\" \"Them's the travellinest hosses ever I seed.\"\n\"She's the workinest woman!\" \"Jim is the disablest one o' the fam'ly.\"\n\"Damn this fotch-on kraut that comes in tin cans!\"\n\nA verb may serve as an adverb: \"If I'd a-been thoughted enough.\" An\nadverb may be used as an adjective: \"I hope the folks with you is gaily\"\n(well). An adjective can serve as an adverb: \"He laughed master.\"\nSometimes a conjunction is employed as a preposition: \"We have oblige to\ntake care on him.\"\n\nThese are not mere blunders of individual illiterates, but usages common\nthroughout the mountains, and hence real dialect.\n\nThe ancient syllabic plural is preserved in beasties (horses), nesties,\nposties, trousies (these are not diminutives), and in that strange word\ndummerunses that I cited before.\n\nPleonasms are abundant. \"I done done it\" (have done it or did do it).\n\"Durin' the while.\" \"In this day and time.\" \"I thought it would surely,\nundoubtedly turn cold.\" \"A small, little bitty hole.\" \"Jane's a\ntol'able big, large, fleshy woman.\" \"I ginerally, usually take a dram\nmornin's.\" \"These ridges is might' nigh straight up and down, and, as\nthe feller said, perpendic'lar.\"\n\nEverywhere in the mountains we hear of biscuit-bread, ham-meat,\nrifle-gun, rock-clift, ridin'-critter, cow-brute, man-person,\nwomen-folks, preacher-man, granny-woman and neighbor-people. In this\ncategory belong the famous double-barreled pronouns: we-all and you-all\nin Kentucky, we-uns and you-uns in Carolina and Tennessee. (I have even\nheard such locution as this: \"Let's we-uns all go over to youerunses\nhouse.\") Such usages are regarded generally as mere barbarisms, and so\nthey are in English, but Miss Murfree cites correlatives in the Romance\nlanguages: French _nous autres_, Italian _noi altri_, Spanish\n_nosotros_.\n\nThe mountaineers have some queer ways of intensifying expression. \"I'd\n_tell_ a man,\" with the stress as here indicated, is simply a strong\naffirmative. \"We had one more _time_\" means a rousing good time.\n\"P'int-blank\" is a superlative or an epithet: \"We jist p'int-blank got\nit to do.\" \"Well, p'int-blank, if they ever come back again, I'll move!\"\n\nA double negative is so common that it may be crowded into a single\nword: \"I did it the unthoughtless of anything I ever done in my life.\"\nTriple negatives are easy: \"I ain't got nary none.\" A mountaineer can\naccomplish the quadruple: \"That boy ain't never done nothin' nohow.\"\nYea, even the quintuple: \"I ain't never seen no men-folks of no kind do\nno washin'.\"\n\nOn the other hand, the veriest illiterates often startle a stranger by\nglib use of some word that most of us picked up in school or seldom use\ninformally. \"I can make a hunderd pound o' pork outen that hog--tutor it\njist right.\" \"Them clouds denote rain.\" \"She's so dilitary!\" \"They stood\nthar and caviled about it.\" \"That exceeds the measure.\" \"Old Tom is\nblind, but he can discern when the sun is shinin'.\" \"Jerry proffered to\nfix the gun for me.\" I had supposed that the words cuckold and moon-calf\nhad none but literary usage in America, but we often hear them in the\nmountains, cuckold being employed both as verb and as noun, and\nmoon-calf in its baldly literal sense that would make Prospero's taunt\nto Caliban a superlative insult.\n\nOur highlander often speaks in Elizabethan or Chaucerian or even\npre-Chaucerian terms. His pronoun hit antedates English itself, being\nthe Anglo-Saxon neuter of he. Ey God, a favorite expletive, is the\noriginal of egad, and goes back of Chaucer. Ax for ask and kag for keg\nwere the primitive and legitimate forms, which we trace as far as the\ntime of Layamon. When the mountain boy challenges his mate: \"I dar ye--I\nain't afeared!\" his verb and participle are of the same ancient and\nsterling rank. Afore, atwixt, awar, heap o' folks, peart, up and done\nit, usen for used, all these everyday expressions of the backwoods were\ncontemporary with the _Canterbury Tales_.\n\nA man said to me of three of our acquaintances: \"There's been a fray on\nthe river--I don't know how the fraction begun, but Os feathered into\nDan and Phil, feedin' them lead.\" He meant fray in its original sense of\ndeadly combat, as was fitting where two men were killed. Fraction for\nrupture is an archaic word, rare in literature, though we find it in\n_Troilus and Cressida_. \"Feathered into them!\" Where else can we hear\nto-day a phrase that passed out of standard English when \"villainous\nsaltpetre\" supplanted the long-bow? It means to bury an arrow up to the\nfeather, as when the old chronicler Harrison says, \"An other arrow\nshould haue beene fethered in his bowels.\"\n\n\n[Illustration: Photo by Arthur Keith\n\n\"Till the skyline blends with the sky itself.\"--Great Smokies. N. C.\nfrom Mt. Collins.]\n\n\nOur schoolmaster, composing a form of oath for the new mail-carrier,\nremarked: \"Let me study this thing over; then I can edzact it\"--a verb\nso rare and obsolete that we find it in no American dictionary, but only\nin Murray.\n\nA remarkable word, common in the Smokies, is dauncy, defined for me as\n\"mincy about eating,\" which is to say fastidious, over-nice. Dauncy\nprobably is a variant of daunch, of which the _Oxford New English\nDictionary_ cites but one example, from the _Townley Mysteries_ of\n_circa_ 1460.\n\nA queer term used by Carolina mountaineers, without the faintest notion\nof its origin, is doney (long _o_) or doney-gal, meaning a sweetheart.\nIts history is unique. British sailors of the olden time brought it to\nEngland from Spanish or Italian ports. Doney is simply _do\u00c3\u00b1a_ or _donna_\na trifle anglicized in pronunciation. Odd, though, that it should be\npreserved in America by none but backwoodsmen whose ancestors for two\ncenturies never saw the tides!\n\nIn the vocabulary of the mountaineers I have detected only three words\nof directly foreign origin. Doney is one. Another is kraut, which is the\nsole contribution to highland speech of those numerous Germans (mostly\nPennsylvania Dutch) who joined the first settlers in this region, and\nwhose descendants, under wondrously anglicized names, form to-day a\nconsiderable element of the highland population. The third is sashiate\n(French _chass\u00c3\u00a9_), used in calling figures at the country dances.\n\nThere is something intrinsically, stubbornly English in the nature of\nthe mountaineer: he will assimilate nothing foreign. In the Smokies the\nEastern Band of Cherokees still holds its ancient capital on the Okona\nLufty River, and the whites mingle freely with these redskins, bearing\nthem no such despite as they do negroes, but eating at the same table\nand admitting Indians to the white compartment of a Jim Crow car. Yet\nthe mountain dialect contains not one word of Cherokee origin, albeit\nmany of the whites can speak a little Cherokee.\n\nIn our county some Indians always appear at each term of court, and an\ninterpreter must be engaged. He never goes by that name, but by the\nobsolete title linkister or link'ster, by some lin-gis-ter.\n\nMany other old-fashioned terms are preserved in Appalachia that sound\ndelightfully quaint to strangers who never met them outside of books. A\nmarried woman is not addressed as Missis by the mountaineers, but as\nMistress when they speak formally, and as Mis' or Miz' for a\ncontraction. We will hear an aged man referred to as \"old Grandsir'\"\nSo-and-So. \"Back this letter for me\" is a phrase unchanged from the days\nbefore envelopes, when an address had to be written on the back of the\nletter itself. \"Can I borry a race of ginger?\" means the unground\nroot--you will find the word in _A Winter's Tale_. \"Them sorry fellers\"\ndenotes scabby knaves, good-for-nothings. Sorry has no etymological\nconnection with sorrow, but literally means sore-y, covered with sores,\nand the highlander sticks to its original import.\n\nWe have in the mountains many home-born words to fit the circumstances\nof backwoods life. When maize has passed from the soft and milky stage\nof roasting-ears, but is not yet hard enough for grinding, the ears are\ngrated into a soft meal and baked into delectable pones called\ngritted-bread.\n\nIn some places to-day we still find the ancient quern or hand-mill,\njocularly called an armstrong-machine. Someone who irked from turning it\ninvented the extraordinary improvement that goes by the name of\npounding-mill. This consists of a pole pivoted horizontally on top of a\npost and free to move up and down like the walking-beam of an\nold-fashioned engine. To one end of this pole is attached a heavy\npestle that works in a mortar underneath. At the other end is a box\nfrom which water flows from an elevated spout. When the box fills it\nwill go down, lifting the pestle; then the water spills out and the\npestle's weight lifts the box back again.\n\nWho knows what a toddick or taddle is? I did not until my friend Dargan\nreported it from the Nantahala. \"Ben didn't git a full turn o' meal, but\njest a toddick.\" When a farmer goes to one of our little tub-mills,\nmentioned in previous chapters, he leaves a portion of the meal as toll.\nThis he measures out in a toll-dish or toddick or taddle (the name\nvaries with the locality) which the mill-owner left for that purpose.\nToddick, then, is a small measure. A turn of meal is so called because\n\"each man's corn is ground in turn--he waits his turn.\"\n\nWhen one dines in a cabin back in the hills he will taste some strange\ndishes that go by still stranger names. Beans dried in the pod, then\nboiled \"hull and all,\" are called leather-breeches (this is not slang,\nbut the regular name). Green beans in the pod are called snaps; when\nshelled they are shuck-beans. The old Germans taught their Scotch and\nEnglish neighbors the merits of scrapple, but here it is known as\npoor-do. Lath-open bread is made from biscuit dough, with soda and\nbuttermilk, in the usual way, except that the shortening is worked in\nlast. It is then baked in flat cakes, and has the peculiar property of\nparting readily into thin flakes when broken edgewise. I suppose that\npoor-do was originally poor-doin's, and lath-open bread denotes that it\nopens into lath-like strips. But etymology cannot be pushed recklessly\nin the mountains, and I offer these clews as a mere surmise.\n\nYour hostess, proffering apple sauce, will ask, \"Do you love sass?\" I\nhad to kick my chum Andy's shins the first time he faced this question.\nIt is well for a traveler to be forewarned that the word love is\ncommonly used here in the sense of like or relish.\n\nIf one is especially fond of a certain dish he declares that he is a\nfool about it. \"I'm a plumb fool about pickle-beans.\" Conversely, \"I\nain't much of a fool about liver\" is rather more than a hint of\ndistaste. \"I et me a bait\" literally means a mere snack, but jocosely it\nmay admit a hearty meal. If the provender be scant the hostess may say,\n\"That's right at a smidgen,\" meaning little more than a mite; but if\nplenteous, then there are rimptions.\n\nTo \"grabble 'taters\" is to pick from a hill of new potatoes a few of\nthe best, then smooth back the soil without disturbing the immature\nones.\n\nIf the house be in disorder it is said to be all gormed or gaumed up, or\nthings are just in a mommick.\n\nWhen a man is tired he likely will call it worried; if in a hurry, he is\nin a swivvet; if nervous, he has the all-overs; if declining in health,\nhe is on the down-go. If he and his neighbor dislike each other, there\nis a hardness between them; if they quarrel, it is a ruction, a rippit,\na jower, or an upscuddle--so be it there are no fatalities which would\namount to a real fray.\n\nA choleric or fretful person is tetchious. Survigrous (ser-_vi_-grus) is\na superlative of vigorous (here pronounced _vi_-grus, with long _i_): as\n\"a survigrous baby,\" \"a most survigrous cusser.\" Bodaciously means\nbodily or entirely: \"I'm bodaciously ruint\" (seriously injured). \"Sim\ngreened him out bodaciously\" (to green out or sap is to outwit in\ntrade). To disfurnish or discon_fit_ means to incommode: \"I hope it has\nnot disconfit you very bad.\"\n\nTo shamp means to shingle or trim one's hair. A bastard is a woods-colt\nor an outsider. Slaunchways denotes slanting, and si-godlin or\nsi-antigodlin is out of plumb or out of square (factitious words, of\ncourse--mere nonsense terms, like catawampus).\n\nCritter and beast are usually restricted to horse and mule, and brute to\na bovine. A bull or boar is not to be mentioned as such in mixed\ncompany, but male-brute and male-hog are used as euphemisms.[9]\n\nA female shoat is called a gilt. A spotted animal is said to be pieded\n(pied), and a striped one is listed. In the Smokies a toad is called a\nfrog or a toad-frog, and a toadstool is a frog-stool. The woodpecker is\nturned around into a peckerwood, except that the giant woodpecker (here\nstill a common bird) is known as a woodcock or woodhen.\n\nWhat the mountaineers call hemlock is the shrub leucothoe. The hemlock\ntree is named spruce-pine, while spruce is he-balsam, balsam itself is\nshe-balsam, laurel is ivy, and rhododendron is laurel. In some places\npine needles are called twinkles, and the locust insect is known as a\nferro (Pharaoh?). A treetop left on the ground after logging is called\nthe lap. Sobby wood means soggy or sodden, and the verb is to sob.\n\nEvening, in the mountains, begins at noon instead of at sunset. Spell is\nused in the sense of while (\"a good spell atterward\") and soon for early\n(\"a soon start in the morning\"). The hillsmen say \"a year come June,\"\n\"Thursday 'twas a week ago,\" and \"the year nineteen and eight.\"\n\nMany common English words are used in peculiar senses by the mountain\nfolk, as call for name or mention or occasion, clever for obliging,\nmimic or mock for resemble, a power or a sight for much, risin' for\nexceeding (also for inflammation), ruin for injure, scout for elude,\nstove for jabbed, surround for go around, word for phrase, take off for\nhelp yourself. Tale always means an idle or malicious report.\n\nSome highland usages that sound odd to us are really no more than the\noriginal and literal meanings, as budget for bag or parcel, hampered for\nshackled or jailed. When a mountain swain \"carries his gal to meetin'\"\nhe is not performing so great an athletic feat as was reported by\nBenjamin Franklin, who said, \"My father carried his wife with three\nchildren to New England\" (from Pennsylvania).\n\nA mountaineer does not throw a stone; he \"flings a rock.\" He sharpens\ntools on a grindin'-rock or whet-rock. Tomato, cabbage, molasses and\nbaking powder are used always as plural nouns. \"Pass me them molasses.\"\n\"I'll have a few more of them cabbage.\" \"How many bakin'-powders has you\ngot?\"\n\nMany other peculiar words and phrases are explained in their proper\nplace elsewhere in this volume.\n\nThe speech of the southern highlanders is alive with quaint idioms. \"I\nswapped hosses, and I'll tell you fer why.\" \"Your name ain't much\ncommon.\" \"Who got to beat?\" \"You think me of it in the mornin'.\" \"I 'low\nto go to town to-morrow.\" \"The woman's aimin' to go to meetin'.\" \"I had\nin head to plow to-day, but hit's come on to rain.\" \"I've laid off and\nlaid off to fix that fence.\" \"Reckon Pete was knowin' to the\nsarcumstance?\" \"I'll name it to Newt, if so be he's thar.\" \"I knowed in\nreason she'd have the mullygrubs over them doin's.\" \"You cain't handily\nblame her.\"\n\n\"Air ye plumb bereft?\" \"How come it was this: he done me dirt.\" \"I ain't\ncarin' which nor whether about it.\" \"Sam went to Andrews or to Murphy,\none.\" \"I tuk my fut in my hand and lit out.\" \"He lit a rag fer home.\"\n\"Don't much believe the wagon 'll come to-day.\" \"Tain't powerful long\nto dinner, I don't reckon.\" \"Phil's Ann give it out to each and every\nthat Walt and Layunie 'd orter wed.\"\n\n\"Howdy, Tom: light and hitch.\"\n\n\"Reckon I'd better git on.\"\n\n\"Come in and set.\"\n\n\"Cain't stop long.\"\n\n\"Oh, set down and eat you some supper!\"\n\n\"I've been.\"\n\n\"Won't ye stay the night? Looks like to me we'll have a rainin', windin'\nspell.\"\n\n\"No: I'll haffter go down.\"\n\n\"Well, come agin, and fix to stay a week.\"\n\n\"You-uns come down with me.\"\n\n\"Won't go now, I guess, Tom.\"\n\n\"Giddep! I'll be back by in the mornin'.\"\n\n\"Farwell!\"\n\nRather laconic. Yet, on occasion, when the mountaineer is drawn out of\nhis natural reserve and allows his emotions free rein, there are few\neducated people who can match his picturesque and pungent diction. His\ntrick of apt phrasing is intuitive. Like an artist striking off a\nportrait or a caricature with a few swift strokes his characterization\nis quick and vivid. Whether he use quaint obsolete English or equally\ndelightful perversions, what he says will go straight to the mark with\nepigrammatic force.\n\nI cannot quit this topic without reference to the bizarre and original\nplace-names that sprinkle the map of Appalachia.\n\nMany readers of John Fox's novels take for granted that the author\ncoined such piquant titles as Lonesome, Troublesome, Hell fer Sartin,\nand Kingdom Come. But all of these are real names in the Kentucky\nmountains. They denote rough country, and the country _is_ rough, so\nthat to a traveler it is plain enough why travel and travail were used\ninterchangeably in old editions of Shakespeare. There is nothing like\nfirst-hand knowledge of mountain roads to revive sixteenth-century\nhabits of thought and speech. The most scrupulous visitor will fain\nadmit the aptness of mountain nomenclature.\n\nKentucky has no monopoly of grotesque and whimsical local names. The\nwhole Appalachian region, from the Virginias to Alabama, is peppered\nwith them. Whatever else the southern mountaineer may be, he is\noriginal. Elsewhere throughout America we have place-names imported from\nthe Old World as thick as weeds; but the pioneers of the southern hills\neither forgot that there was an Old World or they disdained to borrow\nfrom it.\n\nPersonal names applied to localities are common enough, but they are\nthose of actual settlers, not of notables honored from afar (Mitchell,\nLeConte, Guyot, were not the highlanders' names for those peaks). Often\na surname is put to such use, as Jake's Creek, Old Nell Knob, and Big\nJonathan Run. We even have Granny's Branch, and Daddy and Mammy creeks.\n\nIn the main it is characteristic of our Appalachian place-names that\nthey are descriptive or commemorate some incident. The Shut-in is a\ngorge; the Suck is a whirlpool; Pinch-gut is a narrow passage between\nthe cliffs. Calf-killer Run is \"whar a meat-eatin' bear was usin',\" and\nBarren She Mountain was the death-ground of a she-bear that had no cubs.\nKemmer's Old Stand was a certain hunter's favorite ambush on a runway.\nMeat-scaffold Branch is where venison was hung up for \"jerking.\"\nGraining-block Creek was a trappers' rendezvous, and Honey Camp Run is\nwhere the bee hunters stayed. Lick-log denotes a notched log used for\nsalting cattle. Still-house Branch was a moonshiners' retreat. Skin-linn\nFork is where the bast was peeled from young lindens. Big Butt is what\nWesterners call a butte. Ball-play Bottom was a lacrosse field of the\nIndians. Pizen Gulch was infested with poison ivy or sumach. Keerless\nKnob is \"a joyful place for wild salat\" (_amaranthus_). A \"hell\" or\n\"slick\" or \"woolly-head\" or \"yaller patch\" is a thicket of laurel or\nrhododendron, impassable save where the bears have bored out trails.\n\nThe qualities of the raw backwoodsmen are printed from untouched\nnegatives in the names he has left upon the map. His literalness shows\nin Black Rock, Standing Stone, Sharp Top, Twenty Mile, Naked Place, The\nPocket, Tumbling Creek, and in the endless designations taken from\ntrees, plants, minerals, or animals noted on the spot. Incidents of his\nlonely life are signalized in Dusk Camp Run, Mad Sheep Mountain, Dog\nSlaughter Creek, Drowning Creek, Burnt Cabin Branch, Broken Leg, Raw\nDough, Burnt Pone, Sandy Mush, and a hundred others. His contentious\nspirit blazes forth in Fighting Creek, Shooting Creek, Gouge-eye,\nVengeance, Four Killer, and Disputanta.\n\nSometimes even his superstitions are commemorated. In Owesley County,\nKentucky, is a range of hills bearing the singular name of Whoop fer\nLarrie. A party of hunters, so the legend goes, had encamped for the\nnight in the shelter of a bluff. They were startled from sleep by a\nloud rumble, as of some wagon hurrying along the pathless ridge, and\nthey heard a voice shouting \"Whoop fer Larrie! Whoop fer Larrie!\" The\nhills would return no echo, for the cry came from a riotous \"ha'nt.\"\n\nA sardonic humor, sometimes smudged with \"that touch of grossness in our\nEnglish race,\" characterizes many of the backwoods place-names. In the\nmountains of Old Virginia we have Dry Tripe settlement and Jerk 'em\nTight. In West Virginia are Take In Creek, Get In Run, Seldom Seen\nHollow, Odd, Buster Knob, Shabby Room, and Stretch Yer Neck. North\nCarolina has its Shoo Bird Mountain, Big Bugaboo Creek, Weary Hut, Frog\nLevel, Shake a Rag, and the Chunky Gal. In eastern Tennessee are No Time\nsettlement and No Business Knob, with creeks known as Big Soak, Suee, Go\nForth, and How Come You. Georgia has produced Scataway, Too Nigh, Long\nNose, Dug Down, Silly Cook, Turkey Trot, Broke Jug Creek, and Tear\nBreeches Ridge.\n\nAllowing some license for the mountaineer's irreverence, his whimsical\nfancies, and his scorn of sentimentalism, it must be said that his\ndescriptive terms are usually apposite and sometimes felicitous. Often\nhe is poetically imaginative, occasionally romantic, and generally\npicturesque. Roan Mountain, Grandfather, the Lone Bald, Craggy Dome,\nthe Black Brothers, Hairy Bear, the Balsam Cone, Sunset Mountain, the\nLittle Snowbird, are names that linger lovingly in one's memory.\n\nThe writer recalls with pleasure not only the features but the mere\ntitles of that superb landscape that he shared with the wild creatures\nand a few woodsmen when living far up on the divide of the Great Smoky\nMountains. Immediately below his cabin were the Defeat and Desolation\nbranches of Bone Valley, with Hazel Creek meandering to the Little\nTennessee. Cheoah, Tululah, Santeetlah, the Tuckaseegee, and the\nNantahala (Valley of the Noonday Sun) flowed through gorges overlooked\nby the Wauchecha, the Yalaka and the Cowee ranges, Tellico, Wahyah, the\nStanding Indian and the Tusquitee.[10] Sonorous names, these, which our\npioneers had the good sense to adopt from the aborigines.\n\nTo the east were Cold Spring Knob, the Miry Ridge, Siler's Bald,\nClingman's Dome, and the great peaks at the head of Okona Lufty. On the\nwest rose Brier Knob, Laurel Top, Thunderhead, Blockhouse, the\nFodder-stack, and various \"balds\" of the Unakas guarding Hiwassee. To\nthe northward were Cade's Cove and the vale of Tuckaleechee, with\nChilhowee in the near distance, and the Appalachian Valley stretching\nbeyond our ramparts to where the far Cumberlands marked an ever-blue\nhorizon.\n\nWhat matter that the plenteous roughs about us were branded with rude or\nopprobrious names? Rip Shin Thicket, Dog-hobble Ridge, the Rough Arm,\nBear-wallow, Woolly Ridge, Roaring Fork, Huggins's Hell, the Devil's\nRacepath, his Den, his Courthouse, and other playgrounds of Old\nNick--they, too, were well and fitly named.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nTHE LAW OF THE WILDERNESS\n\n\nIt is only a town-dreamed allegory that represents Nature as a fond\nmother suckling her young upon her breast. Those who have lived\nliterally close to wild Nature know her for a tyrant, void of pity and\nof mercy, from whom nothing can be wrung without toil and the risk of\ndeath.\n\nTo all pioneer men--to their women and children, too--life has been one\nlong, hard, cruel war against elemental powers. Nothing else than\nwarlike arts, nothing short of warlike hazards, could have subdued the\nbeasts and savages, felled the forests and made our land habitable for\nthose teeming millions who can exist only in a state of mutual\ndependence and cultivation. The first lesson of pioneering was\nself-reliance. \"Provide with thine own arm,\" said the Wilderness,\n\"against frost and famine and skulking foes, or thou shalt surely die!\"\n\nBut there were compensations. As the school of the woods was harsh and\nstern, so it brought up sons and daughters of lion heart. And its\nreward to those who endured was the most outright independence to be had\non earth. No king was so irresponsible as the pioneer, no czar so\nabsolute as he. It needed no martyr spirit in him to sing:\n\n  \"I am the master of my fate,\n  I am the captain of my soul.\"\n\n\nWe have seen that the Appalachian region was peculiar in this: that good\nbottom lands were few and far between. So our mountain farmers were cut\noff more from the world and from each other, were thrown still more upon\ntheir individual resources, than other pioneers. By compulsion their\nself-reliance was more complete; hence their independence grew more\nhaughty, their individualism more intense. And these traits, exaggerated\nas they were by force of environment, remain unweakened among their\ndescendants to the present day.\n\nHere, then, is a key to much that is puzzling in highland character. In\nthe beginning isolation was forced upon the mountaineers; they accepted\nit as inevitable and bore it with stoical fortitude until in time they\ncame to love solitude for its own sake and to find compensations in it\nfor lack of society.\n\nSays a native writer, Miss Emma Miles, in a clever and illuminating book\non _The Spirit of the Mountains_: \"We who live so far apart that we\nrarely see more of one another than the blue smoke of each other's\nchimneys are never at ease without the feel of the forest on every\nside--room to breathe, to expand, to develop, as well as to hunt and to\nwander at will. The nature of the mountaineer demands that he have\nsolitude for the unhampered growth of his personality, wing-room for his\neagle heart.\"\n\nSuch feeling, such longing, most of us have experienced in passing\nmoods; but in the highlander it is a permanent state of mind, sustaining\nhim from the cradle to the grave. To enjoy freedom and air and\nelbow-room he cheerfully puts aside all that society can offer, and\nstints himself and bears adversity with a calm and steadfast soul. To be\nfree, unbeholden, lord of himself and his surroundings--that is the wine\nof life to a mountaineer.\n\nSuch a man cannot stand it to be bossed around. If he works for another,\nit must be on a footing of equality. Poverty may oblige him to take a\nturn on some \"public works\" (by which he means any job where many men\nwork together, such as lumbering or railroad building), but he must be\nhandled with more respect than is shown common laborers elsewhere. At a\nsharp order or a curse from the foreman he will flare back: \"That's\nenough out o' you!\" and immediately he will drop his tools. Generally he\nwill stay on a job just long enough to earn money for immediate needs;\nthen back to the farm he goes.\n\nBear in mind that in the mountains every person is accorded the\nconsideration that his own qualities entitle him to, and no whit more.\nIt has always been so. Our Highlanders have neither memory nor tradition\nof ever having been herded together, lorded over, persecuted or denied\nthe privileges of free-men. So, even within their clans, there is no\nservility nor any headship by right of birth. Leaders arise, when\nneeded, only by virtue of acknowledged ability and efficiency. In this\nrespect there is no analogy whatever to the clan system of ancient\nScotland, to which the loose social structure of our own highlanders has\nbeen compared.\n\nWe might expect such fiery individualism to cool gradually as population\ngrew denser; but, oddly enough, crowding only intensifies it in the shy\nbackwoodsman. Neighborliness has not grown in the mountains--it is on\nthe wane. There are to-day fewer log-rollings and house-raisings, fewer\nhusking bees and quilting parties than in former times; _and no new\nsocial gatherings have taken their place_. Our mountain farmer, seeing\nall arable land taken up, and the free range ever narrowing, has grown\njealous and distrustful, resenting the encroachment of too many sharers\nin what once he felt was his own unfenced domain. And so it has come\nabout that the very quality that is his strength and charm as a man--his\nstaunch individualism--is proving his weakness and reproach as a\nneighbor and citizen. The virtue of a time out-worn has become the vice\nof an age new-born.\n\nThe mountaineers are non-social. As they stand to-day, each man\n\"fighting for his own hand, with his back against the wall,\" they\nrecognize no social compact. Each one is suspicious of the other. Except\nas kinsmen or partisans they cannot pull together. Speak to them of\ncommunity of interests, try to show them the advantages of co-operation,\nand you might as well be proffering advice to the North Star. They will\nnot work together zealously even to improve their neighborhood roads,\neach mistrusting that the other may gain some trifling advantage over\nhimself or turn fewer shovelfuls of earth. Labor chiefs fail to organize\nunions or granges among them because they simply will not stick\ntogether.\n\nMiss Miles says of her people (the italics are my own): \"There is no\nsuch thing as a community of mountaineers. They are knit together, man\nto man, as friends, but not as a body of men.... Our men are almost\nincapable of concerted action unless they are needed by the\nGovernment.... Between blood-relationship and the Federal Government no\nrelations of master and servant, rich and poor, learned and ignorant,\nemployer and employee, are interposed to bind society into a whole....\n_The mountaineers must awake to a consciousness of themselves as a\npeople._ For although throughout the highlands of Kentucky, Tennessee\nand the Carolinas our nature is one, our hopes, our loves, our daily\nlife the same, we are yet a people asleep, _a race without knowledge of\nits own existence_. This condition is due ... to the isolation that\nseparates the mountaineer from all the world but his own blood and kin,\nand to the consequent utter simplicity of social relations. When they\nshall have established a unity of thought corresponding to their\nhomogeneity of character, then their love of country will assume a\npractical form, and then, indeed, America, with all her peoples, can\nboast no stronger sons than these same mountaineers.\"\n\nTo the Highlanders of four States here mentioned should be added all\nthose of Old Virginia, West Virginia, Georgia, and Alabama, making an\naggregate to-day of close on four million souls. Together they\nconstitute a distinct people. Not only are they all closely akin in\nblood, in speech, in ideas, in manners, in ways of living; but their\nneeds, their problems are identical throughout this vast domain. There\nis no other ethnic group in America so unmixed as these mountaineers and\nso segregated from all others.\n\nAnd the strange thing is that they do not know it. Their isolation is so\ncomplete that they have no race consciousness at all. In this respect I\ncan think of no other people on the face of the earth to which they may\nbe likened.\n\nAs compensation for the peculiar weakness of their social structure, the\nHighlanders display an undying devotion to family and kindred.\nMountaineers everywhere are passionately attached to their homes. Tear\naway from his native rock your Switzer, your Tyrolean, your Basque, your\nMontenegrin, and all alike are stricken with homesickness beyond speech\nor cure. At the first chance they will return, and thenceforth will\ncling to their patrimonies, however poor these be.\n\nSo, too, our man of the Appalachians.--\"I went down into the valley,\nwunst, and I declar I nigh sultered! 'Pears like there ain't breath\nenough to go round, with all them people. And the water don't do a body\nno good; an' you cain't eat hearty, nor sleep good o' nights. Course\nthey pay big money down thar; but I'd a heap-sight ruther ketch me a big\nold 'coon fer his hide. Boys, I did hone fer my dog Fiddler, an' the\ntimes we'd have a-huntin', and the trout-fishin', an' the smell o' the\nwoods, and nobody bossin' and jowerin' at all. I'm a hill-billy, all\nright, and they needn't to glory their old flat lands to me!\"\n\nDomestic affection is seldom expressed by the mountaineers--not even by\nmotherly or sisterly kisses--but it is very deep and real for all that.\nIn fact, the ties of kinship are stronger with them, and extend to\nremoter degrees of consanguinity, than with any other Americans that I\nknow. Here again we see working the old feudal idea, an anachronism, but\noften a beautiful one, in this bustling commercial age. Our hived and\npromiscuous life in cities is breaking down the old fealty of kith and\nkin. \"God gives us our relatives,\" sighs the modern, \"but, thank God, we\ncan choose our friends!\" Such words would strike a mountaineer deep\nwith horror. Rather would he go the limit of Stevenson's Saint Ives:\n\"If it is a question of going to hell, go to hell like a gentleman, with\nyour ancestors!\"\n\n\n[Illustration: Photo by U. S. Forest Service\n\nWhitewater Falls]\n\n\nWhen the wilderness came to be settled by white men, courts were feeble\nto puerility, and every man was a law unto himself. Many hard characters\ncame in with the pioneers--bad neighbors, arrogant, thievish, bold. As\nsociety was not organized for mutual protection, it was inevitable that\ncousin should look to cousin for help in time of trouble. So arose the\nclan, the family league, and, as things change very slowly in the\nmountains, we still have clan loyalty outside of and superior to the\nlaw. \"My family _right or wrong_!\" is a slogan to which every highlander\nwill rise, with money or arms in hand, and for it he will lay down his\nlast dollar, the last drop of his blood. There is scarce any limit to\nwhich this fealty will not go. Your brother or cousin may have committed\na crime that shocks you as it does all other decent citizens; but will\nyou give him up to the officers and testify against him? Not if you are\na mountaineer. You will hide him out in the laurel, carry him food, keep\nhim posted, help him to break jail, perjure yourself for him in\ncourt--anything, everything, to get him clear.\n\nWe see here a survival, very real and widespread, in this\ntwentieth-century Appalachia, of a condition that was general throughout\nthe Scotch Highlands in the far past. \"The great virtue of the\nHighlander,\" says Lecky, \"was his fidelity to his chief and to his clan.\nIt took the place of patriotism and of loyalty to his sovereign.... In\nthe reign of James V., an insurrection of Clan Chattan having been\nsuppressed by Murray, two hundred of the insurgents were condemned to\ndeath. Each one as he was led to the gallows was offered a pardon if he\nwould reveal the hiding-place of his chief, but they all answered that,\nwere they acquainted with it, no sort of punishment could induce them to\nbe guilty of treachery to their leader.... In 1745 the house of\nMacpherson of Cluny was burnt to the ground by the King's troops. A\nreward of \u00c2\u00a31,000 was offered for his apprehension. A large body of\nsoldiers was stationed in the district and a step of promotion was\npromised to any officer who should secure him. Yet for nine years the\nchief was able to live concealed on his own property in a cave which his\nclansmen dug for him during the night, and, though upwards of one\nhundred persons knew of his place of retreat, no bribe or menace could\nextort the secret.\"\n\nThe same chivalrous, self-sacrificing fidelity to family and to clan\nleader is still shown by our own highlanders, as scores of feuds and\nhundreds of criminal trials attest. All this is openly and unblushingly\n\"above the law\"; but let us remember that the law itself, in many of\nthese localities, is but a feeble, dilatory thing that offers\npractically no protection to those who would obey its letter. So, in an\nimperfectly organized society, it is good to have blood-ties that are\nfaithful unto death. And none knows it better than he who has missed\nit--he who has lived strange and alone in some wild, lawless region\nwhere everyone else had a clan to back him.\n\nSo far as primitive society is concerned, we may admit with the Scotch\nhistorian Henderson that \"the clan system of government was in its way\nan ideally perfect one--probably the only perfect one that has ever\nexisted.... The clansman was not the subject--a term implying some sort\nof conquest--but the kinsman of his chief.... Obedience became rather a\nprivilege than a task, and no possible bribery or menace could shake his\nfidelity. Towards the Sassenach or the members of clans at feud with him\nhe might act meanly, treacherously, and cruelly without check and\nwithout compunction, for there he recognized no moral obligations\nwhatever. But as a clansman to his clan he was courteous, truthful,\nvirtuous, benevolent, with notions of honor as punctilious as those of\nthe ancient knight.\"\n\nThe trouble with clan government was, as this same writer has pointed\nout, that \"it was the very thoroughness of its adaptation to early needs\nthat made it so hard to adjust to new necessities. In its principles and\nmotives it was essentially opposed to the bent of modern influences. Its\nappeal was to sentiment rather than to law or even reason: it was a\nsystem not of the letter but of the spirit.... The clan system was\nefficient only within a narrow area; it gave rise to interminable feuds;\nand it was inapplicable to the circumstances created by the rise of\nmodern industry and trade.\"\n\nEverywhere throughout Highland Dixie to-day we can observe how clan\nloyalty interferes with the administration of justice. When a case\ninvolving some strong family comes up in the courts, immediately a cloud\nof false witnesses arises, men who should testify on the other side are\nbribed or run out of the country before subpoenas can be served, and\nevery juror knows that his peace and prosperity in future depend largely\nupon which side he espouses.\n\nTo what lengths the hostility of a clan may go in defying justice was\nshown recently in the massacre of almost a whole court by the Allen clan\nat Hillsville, Virginia. The news of that atrocity swept like wildfire\nthroughout all Appalachia, its history is being reviewed to-day in\nthousands of mountain cabins, and it is deeply significant that, away\nout here in western Carolina, where no Allen blood relationship\nprejudices men's minds, the prevailing judgment of our backwoodsmen is\nthat the State of Virginia did wrong in executing any of the offenders.\n\"There was something back of it--you mark my words,\" say the country\nfolk. And the drummers, cattle-buyers, and others who pass this way from\nsouthwestern Virginia tell us, \"Everybody up our way sympathizes with\nthe Allens.\"\n\nIn some measure this morbid sentiment is due to the spectacular features\nof the Hillsville tragedy. If there be one human quality that the\nmountaineer admires above all others, it is \"nerve.\" And what greater\ndisplay of nerve has been made in this generation than for a few\nclansmen to shoot down a judge at the bench, the public prosecutor, the\nsheriff, the clerk of the court, and two jurymen, then take to the\nmountain laurel like Corsicans to the _maquis_, and defy the armed\npower of the country? The cause does not matter, to a mountaineer. Our\nHighlanders are anything but robbers, for instance, and yet the only\noutsider who has ballads sung in his memory throughout Appalachia is\nJesse James!--unless Jack Donohue was one--I do not know.--\n\n  Come all ye bold undaunted men\n    And outlaws of the day,\n  Who'd rather wear the ball and chain\n    Than work in slavery!\n\n     *       *       *       *\n\n  Said Donohue to his comrades,\n    \"If you'll prove true to me,\n  This day I'll fight with all my might,\n    I'll fight for liberty;\n  Be of good courage, be bold and strong,\n    Be galliant and be true;\n  This day I'll fight with all my might,\"\n    Says bold Jack Donohue.\n\n     *       *       *       *\n\n  Six policemen he shot down\n    Before the fatal ball\n  Pierced the heart of Donohue\n    And 'casioned him to fall;\n  And then he closed his struggling eyes,\n  And bid this world adieu.\n    Come all ye boys that fear no noise,\n    And pray for Donohue!\n\n\nNo doubt the mountain minstrels are already composing ballads in honor\nof the Allens; for it is a fact we cannot blink at that the outlaw is\nthe popular hero of Appalachia to-day, as Rob Roy and Robin Hood were in\nthe Britain of long ago. This is not due to any ingrained hostility to\nlaw and order as such, but simply to admiration for any men who fight\ndesperately against overwhelming odds. There is a glamour about bold and\nlawless adventure that fascinates mature men and women who have never\noutgrown youthful habits of mind. Whoever has the reputation of being a\ndangerous man to cross--the \"marked\" man, who carries his life upon his\nsleeve, but bears himself as a smiling cavalier--he is the only true\naristocrat among a valorous but primitive people.\n\nBut this is only half an explanation. The statement that our highlanders\nare not hostile to law and order must be qualified to this extent: they\nhave a profound distrust of the courts. The mountaineer is not only a\nborn fighter but he is also litigious by nature and tradition. A\nstranger will be surprised to find how deeply the average backwoodsman\nis versed in the petty subtleties of legal practice. It comes from\nexperience. \"Court-week\" draws bigger crowds than a circus. The\nmountaineer who has never served as juror, witness, or principal in a\nlawsuit is a curiosity. And this familiarity has bred secret contempt. I\nviolate no confidence in saying that many a mountaineer would hold up\none hand to testify his respect for the law while the other hand hovered\nover his pistol.\n\nWhy so?\n\nJust because his experience has taught him (rightly or wrongly--but he\nfirmly believes it) that courts are swayed by sinister influences when\nimportant matters are at stake. Those influences are clan money and clan\nvotes. Hence, if he or a kinsman be involved in \"lawin'\" with a member\nof some rival tribe, he does not look for impartial treatment, but\nprepares to fight cunning with cunning, local influence with local\ninfluence. There are no moral obligations here. \"All's fair in love and\nwar\"--and this is one form of war.\n\nIf the reader will take down his _David Balfour_ and read the intrigues,\nplots, and counterplots of David's attorneys and those of the Crown, he\nwill grasp our own highlanders' viewpoint.\n\n\n[Illustration: Photo by Arthur Keith\n\nThe road follows the Creek.--There may be a dozen fords in a mile.]\n\n\nThat mountain courts are often impotent is due in part to the\nlimitations under which their officers are obliged to serve. For\nexample, in the judicial district where I reside, the solicitor\n(State's attorney) receives nothing but fees, and then only _in case\nof conviction_. It might seem that this would stir him to extra zeal,\nand perhaps it does; but he has a large circuit, there are no local\nofficials specially interested in securing evidence for him while the\ncase is white-hot, everything spurs the defendant to get rid of\ndangerous witnesses before the solicitor can get at them, public opinion\nis extremely lenient toward homicides, and man-slayers so often get off\nscot-free after the most faithful and laborious efforts of the\nsolicitor, that he becomes discouraged.\n\nThe sheriff, too, serves without salary, getting only fees and a\npercentage of tax collections. How this works, in securing witnesses,\nmay be shown by an anecdote.--\n\nI looked up from my work, one day, to see a neighbor striding swiftly\nalong the trail that passed my cabin.\n\n\"You seem in a hurry, John. Woods afire?\"\n\n\"No: I'm dodgin' the sheriff.\"\n\n\"Whose pig was it?\"\n\n\"Aw! He wants me as witness in a concealed weepon case.\"\n\n\"One of your boys?\"\n\n\"Huk-uh: nobody as I'm keerin' fer.\"\n\n\"Then why don't you go?\"\n\n\"I cain't afford to. I'd haffter walk nineteen miles out to the\nrailroad, pay seventy cents the round-trip to the county-site, pay my\nboard thar fer mebbe a week, and then a witness don't git no fee at all\nonless they convict.\"\n\n\"What does the sheriff get for coming away up here?\"\n\n\"Thirty cents for each witness he cotches. He won't git me, Mister Man;\nnot if I know these woods since yistiddy.\"\n\nVerily the law of Swain is hard on the solicitor, hard on the sheriff,\nand hard on the witness, too!\n\nMountaineers place a low valuation on human life. I need not go outside\nmy own habitat for illustrations. In our judicial district, which\ncomprises the westernmost seven counties of North Carolina, the present\nyearly toll of homicides varies, according to counties, from about one\nin 1,000 to one in 2,500 of the population. And ours is not a feud\ndistrict, nor are there any negroes to speak of. Compare these figures\nwith the rate of homicide in the United States at large, about one to\n8,300 population; of Italy, one to 66,000; Great Britain, one to\n111,000; Germany, one to 200,000.\n\nAnd the worst of it is that no Black Hand conspirators or ward gun-men\nor other professional criminals figure in these killings. Practically\nall of them are committed by representative citizens, mostly farmers.\nTake that fact home, and think what it means. Remember, too, that most\nof these murderers either escape with light penal sentences or none at\nall. The only capital sentence imposed in our district within the past\nten years was upon an Indian who had assaulted and murdered a white girl\n(there was no red tape or procrastination about _that_ trial, the\ncourt-house being filled with men who were ready to lynch him under the\njudge's nose if the sentence were not satisfactory).\n\nI said at the very outset of this book that \"Our mountain folk still\nlive in the eighteenth century. The progress of mankind from that age to\nthis is no heritage of theirs.... And so, in order to be fair and just\nwith these our backward kinsmen, we must, for the time, decivilize\nourselves to the extent of _going back_ and getting an eighteenth\ncentury point of view.\"\n\nAs regards the valuation of human life, what was that point of view?\n\nThe late Professor Shaler of Harvard, himself a Southerner, one time\nexplained the prevalence of manslaughter among southern gentlemen. His\nremarks apply with equal truth to our mountaineers, for they, however\npoor they may be in worldly goods, are by no means \"poor white trash,\"\nbut rather patricians, like the ragged but lofty chiefs and clansmen of\nold Scotland.--\n\n     \"Nothing so surprises the northern people as the fact that southern\n     men of good estate will, for what seems to the distant onlooker\n     trifling matters of dispute, proceed to slay each other. Nothing so\n     gravely offends the characteristic southern man as the incapacity\n     of his brethren of northern societies to perceive that such action\n     is natural and consistent with the rules of gentlemanly behavior.\n     The only way to understand these differences of opinion is by a\n     proper consideration of the history of the moral growth of these\n     diverse peoples.\n\n     \"The Southerner has retained and fostered--in a certain way\n     reinstated--the medieval estimate as to the value of life. In the\n     opinion of those ages it was but lightly esteemed; it was not a\n     supreme good for which almost all else was to be sacrificed, but\n     something to be taken in hand and put in risk in the pursuit of\n     manly ideals.\n\n     \"Modernism has worked to intensify the passion for existence until\n     those who are the most under its dominion cannot well conceive how\n     a man, except for some supreme duty to which he is pledged by\n     altruistic motives, can give up his own life or take that of his\n     neighbor. If these people of to-day will but perceive that the\n     characteristic Southerner has preserved the motives of two\n     centuries ago, if they will but inform themselves as to the state\n     of mind on this subject which prevailed in the epoch when those\n     motives were shaped in men, they will see that their judgment is\n     harsh and unreasonable. It is much as if they judged the actions of\n     Englishmen of the seventeenth century by the changed standards of\n     to-day.\n\n     \"Nor will it be altogether reasonable to condemn the lack of regard\n     of life which we find in the southern gentleman as compared with\n     his northern contemporary. We must, of course, reprobate in every\n     way the evil consequences of this state of mind; but the question\n     as to the propriety of that extreme devotion to continued mundane\n     existence which is so manifest in our modern civilization is\n     certainly open to debate. Irrational and brutal as are the ways in\n     which the old-fashioned gentleman of the South shows that his\n     regard for his own honor or that of his household outweighs his\n     love of life, it must be remembered that the same condition existed\n     in the richest ages of our race--those which gave proportionally\n     the largest share of ability and nobility to its history.\n\n     \"As long as men are more keenly sensitive to the opinions of their\n     fellows than they are to the other goods which existence brings\n     them, as long as this opinion makes personal valor and truthfulness\n     the jewels of their lives, we must expect now and then to have\n     degradation of the essentially noble motives. It is, undoubtedly, a\n     dangerous state of mind, but not one that is degraded.\"--(_North\n     American Review_, October, 1890.)\n\n\n\"The motives of two centuries ago\" are the motives of present-day\nAppalachia. Here the right of private war is not questioned, outside of\na judge's charge from the bench, which everybody takes as a mere\nformality, a convention that is not to be taken seriously. The argument\nis this: that when Society, as represented by the State, cannot protect\na man or secure him his dues, then he is not only justified but in duty\nbound to defend himself or seize what is his own. And in the mountains\nSociety with the big _S_ is often powerless against the Clan with a\nbigger _C_.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nTHE BLOOD-FEUD\n\n\nIn Corsica, when a man is wronged by another, public sentiment requires\nthat he redress his own grievance, and that his family and friends shall\nshare the consequences.\n\n\"Before the law made us citizens, great Nature made us men.\"\n\n\"When one has an enemy, one must choose between the three\nS's--_schiopetto, stiletto, strada_: the rifle, the dagger, or\nflight.\"\n\n\"There are two presents to be made to an enemy--_palla calda o ferro\nfreddo_: hot shot or cold steel.\"\n\nThe Corsican code of honor does not require that vengeance be taken in\nfair fight. Rather should there be a sudden thrust of the knife, or a\npistol fired point-blank into the enemy's breast, or a rifle-shot from\nsome ambush picked in advance.\n\nThe assassin is not conscious of any cowardice in such act. If the\ntrouble between him and his foe had been strictly a personal matter, to\nbe settled forever by one man's fall, then he might have welcomed a\nduel with all the punctilios. But his blood is not his alone--it belongs\nto his clan. Whenever a Corsican is slain his family takes up the feud.\nA vendetta ensues--a war of extermination by clan against clan.\n\nNow, the chief object of war, as all strategists agree, is to inflict\nthe greatest loss upon the enemy with the least loss to one's own side.\nHence we have hostilities without declaration of war; we have the\nambush, the night attack, masked batteries, mines and submarines. Thus\nwe murder hundreds asleep or unshriven. This is war.\n\nMoreover, while a soldier must be brave in any extremity, it is no less\nhis duty to save himself unharmed as long as he can, so that he may help\nhis own side and kill more and more of the enemy. Therefore it is proper\nand military for him to \"snipe\" his foes by deliberate sharpshooting\nfrom behind any lurking-place that he can find. This is war.\n\nAnd the vendetta, says our Corsican, is nothing else than war.\n\nWhen Matteo has been slain by an enemy, his friends carry his body home\nand swear vengeance over the corpse, while his wife soaks her\nhandkerchief in his wounds to keep as a token whereby she will incite\nher children, as they grow up, to war against all kinsmen of their\nfather's murderer.\n\nThen a son or brother of Matteo slips forth into the night, full-armed\nto slay like a dog any member of the rival faction whom he may find at a\ndisadvantage. The deed done, he flies to the _maquis_, the mountain\nthicket, and there he will hide, dodging the gendarmes, fighting off his\nenemies--an outlaw with a price upon his head, but pitied or admired by\nall Corsicans outside the feud, and succored by his clan.\n\nIt is a far cry from the Mediterranean to our own Appalachia: so why\nthis prelude? Our mountaineers never heard of Corsica. Not a drop of\nSouth European blood flows in their veins. Few of them ever heard one\nword of a foreign tongue. True. And yet we shall mark some strange\nanalogies between Corsican vendettas and Appalachian feuds, Corsican\nclannishness and Appalachian clannishness, Corsican women and our\nmountain women--before this chapter ends.\n\nLong, long ago, in the mountains of eastern Kentucky, Dr. Abner Baker\nmarried a Miss White. Daniel Bates married Baker's sister, but separated\nfrom her in 1844. Baker charged Bates with undue intimacy with his wife,\nand killed him. The Whites, defending their kinswoman, prosecuted the\nDoctor, but he was acquitted, and moved to Cuba.\n\nAfterwards Baker returned. In flat violation of the Constitution of the\nUnited States, he was tried a second time for the murder of Bates, was\nconvicted, and was hanged. Thenceforth there was \"bad blood\" between the\nBakers and the Whites, involving the Garrards on one side and the\nHowards on the other, as allies to the respective clans.\n\nIn 1898, Tom Baker, reputed to be the best shot in the Kentucky\nmountains, bought a note given by A. B. Howard, for whom he was cutting\ntimber. Howard became furious, a fight ensued, one of the Howard boys\nand Burt Stores were killed from ambush, and the elder Howard was\nwounded.\n\nThereupon Jim Howard, son of the clan chief, sought out Tom Baker's\nfather, who was county attorney, compelled the unarmed old man to fall\nupon his knees, shot him twenty-five times with careful aim to avoid a\nvital spot, and so killed him by inches. Howard was tried and convicted\nof murder, but it is said that a pardon was offered him if he would go\nto the State Capitol at Frankfort and assassinate Governor Goebel, which\nhe is charged with having done.\n\nIn Clay County, where this feud waged, the judge, clerk, sheriff, and\njailer were of the White clan. Tom Baker killed a brother of the sheriff\nand took to the hills rather than give himself up to a court ruled by\nhis foemen. Then Albert Garrard was fired upon from ambush while riding\nwith his wife to a religious meeting. He removed to Pineville, in\nanother county, under guard of two armed men, both of whom were shot\ndead \"from the bresh.\"\n\nGovernor Bradley sent State troops into Clay County, and Tom Baker\nsurrendered to them. Baker was tried in the Knox Circuit Court, on a\nchange of venue, and was sentenced to the penitentiary for life. On\nappeal his attorneys secured a reversal of the verdict, and Baker was\nreleased on bail. The new trial was set for June, 1899. Governor Bradley\nagain sent a company of State militia, with a Gatling gun, to Manchester\nwhere the trial was to be held. Baker was put in a guard-tent surrounded\nby a squad of soldiers. A hundred yards or so from this tent stood the\nunoccupied residence of the sheriff, at the foot of a wooded mountain.\nAn assassin hidden in this house spied upon the guard-tent, and, when\nBaker appeared, shot him dead with a rifle, then took to the woods and\nescaped.\n\nI quote now from a history of this feud published in _Munsey's Magazine_\nof November, 1903.--\n\n     \"Captain John Bryan, of the 2d Kentucky, said to the widow of the\n     murdered Tom Baker, after they returned from the funeral:\n\n     \"'Mrs. Baker, why don't you leave this miserable country and escape\n     from these terrible feuds? Move away, and teach your children to\n     forget.'\n\n     \"'Captain Bryan,' said the widow, and she spoke evenly and quietly,\n     'I have twelve sons. It will be the chief aim of my life to bring\n     them up to avenge their father's death. Each day I shall show my\n     boys _the handkerchief stained with his blood_, and tell them who\n     murdered him.'\"\n\n\nCorsican vendetta or Kentucky feud--what are language and race against\nage-long isolation and an environment that keeps humanity feral to the\ncore?\n\nShortly after Baker's death, four Griffins, of the White-Howard faction,\nambushed Big John Philpotts and his cousin, wounding the former severely\nand the latter mortally. Big John fought them from behind a log and\nkilled all four.\n\nOn July 17, 1899, four of the Philpotts were attacked by four Morrises,\nof the Howard side. Three men were killed, three mortally wounded, and\nthe other two were severely injured. No arrests were made.\n\nFinally, in 1901, the two clans fought a pitched battle in front of the\ncourt-house in Manchester. At its conclusion they formally signed a\ntruce.\n\nThis is a mere scenario of a feud in the wealthiest and best-schooled\ncounty of eastern Kentucky. Two of the families involved were of\ndistinguished lineage, counting in their ranks a governor, three\ngenerals, a member of Congress, and a prohibition candidate for the\nPresidency.\n\nIn reviewing this feud, Governor Bradley stated:\n\n     \"The whole fault in Clay County is a vitiated public sentiment and\n     a failure of the civil authorities to do their duty. The laws are\n     insufficient for the Governor to apply a remedy. Such feuds have\n     been in progress more or less for years, and no Governor of the\n     State has ever been able to quell them. They have terminated only\n     when their force was spent by one side or the other being killed or\n     moving out of the country.\"\n\n\n\"The laws are insufficient for the Governor to apply a remedy.\" One\nnaturally asks, \"How so?\" The answer is that the Governor cannot send\ntroops into a county except upon request of the civil authorities, and\nthey must go as a posse to civil officers. In most feuds these officers\nare partisans (in fact, it is a favorite ruse for one clan to win or\nusurp the county offices before making war). Hence the State troops\nwould only serve as a reinforcement to one of the contending factions.\nTo show how this works out, we will sketch briefly the course of another\nfeud.--\n\nIn Rowan County, Kentucky, in 1884, there was an election quarrel\nbetween two members of the Martin and Toliver families. The Logans sided\nwith the Martins and the Youngs with the Tolivers. The Logan-Martin\nfaction elected their candidate for sheriff by a margin of twelve votes.\nThen there was an affray in which one Logan was killed and three were\nwounded.\n\nAs usual, in feuds, no immediate redress was attempted, but the injured\nclan plotted its vengeance with deadly deliberation. After five months,\nDick Martin killed Floyd Toliver. His own people worked the trick of\narresting him themselves and sent him to Winchester for safe-keeping.\nThe Tolivers succeeded in having him brought back on a forged order and\nkilled him when he was bound and helpless.\n\nThe leader of the Young-Toliver faction was a notorious bravo named\nCraig Toliver. To strengthen his power he became candidate for town\nmarshal of Morehead, and he won the office by intimidation at the polls.\nThen, for two years, a bushwhacking war went on. Three times the\nGovernor sent troops into Rowan County, but each time they found nothing\nbut creeks and thickets to fight. Then he prevailed upon the clans to\nsign a truce and expatriate their chiefs for one year in distant States.\nCraig Toliver obeyed the order by going to Missouri, but returned\nseveral months before the expiration of his term, _resumed office_, and\nrenewed his atrocities. In the warfare that ensued all the county\nofficers were involved, from the judge down.\n\nIn 1887, Proctor Knott, Governor of Kentucky, said in his message, of\nthe Logan-Toliver feud:\n\n     \"Though composed of only a small portion of the community, these\n     factions have succeeded by their violence in overawing and\n     silencing the voice of the peaceful element, and in intimidating\n     the officers of the law. Having their origin partly in party\n     rancor, they have ceased to have any political significance, and\n     have become contests of personal ambition and revenge; each party\n     seeking apparently to possess itself of the machinery of justice in\n     order that it may, under the forms of law, seek the gratification\n     of personal animosities.\n\n     \"During the present year the local leader of one of these factions\n     came in possession of the office of police judge of the town of\n     Morehead. Under color of the authority of that office, and\n     sustained by an armed band of adherents, he exercised despotic sway\n     over the town and its vicinage. He banished citizens who were\n     obnoxious to him; and, in one instance, after arresting two\n     citizens who seem to have been guilty of no offense, he and his\n     party, attended by a deputy sheriff of the county, murdered them in\n     cold blood.\n\n     \"This act of atrocity fully aroused the community. A posse acting\n     under the authority of a warrant from the county judge attacked the\n     police judge and his adherents on the 22d of June last, killed\n     several of their number, and put the rest to flight, and\n     temporarily restored something like tranquility to the community.\n\n     \"The proceedings of the Circuit Court, which was held in August,\n     were not calculated to inspire the citizens with confidence in\n     securing justice. The report of the Adjutant General on this\n     subject shows, from information derived 'from representative men\n     without reference to party affiliations,' that the judge of the\n     Circuit Court seems so far under the influence of the reputed\n     leader of one of the factions as to permit such an organization of\n     the grand juries as will effectually prevent the indictment of\n     members of that faction for the most flagrant crimes.\"\n\n\nThe posse here mentioned was organized by Daniel Boone Logan, a cousin\nof the two young men who had been murdered, a college graduate, and a\nlawyer of good standing. With the assent of the Governor, he gathered\nfifty to seventy-five picked men and armed them with the best modern\nrifles and revolvers. Some of the men were of his own clan; others he\nhired. His plan was to end the war by exterminating the Tolivers.\n\n\n[Illustration: Photo by U. S. Forest Service\n\n\"Dense forest luxuriant undergrowth.\"--Mixed hardwoods, Jackson Co., N. C.]\n\n\nThe posse, led by Logan and the sheriff, suddenly surrounded the town of\nMorehead. Everybody gave in except Craig Toliver, Jay Toliver, Bud\nToliver, and Hiram Cook, who barricaded themselves in the railroad\nstation, where all of them were shot dead by the posse.\n\nBoone Logan was indicted for murder. At the trial he admitted the\nkillings; but he showed that the feud had cost the lives of not less\nthan twenty-three men, that not one person had been legally punished for\nthese murders, and that he had acted for the good of the public in\nending this infamous struggle. The court accepted this view of the case,\nthe community sustained it, and the \"war\" was closed.\n\nA feud, in the restricted sense here used, is an armed conflict between\nfamilies, each endeavoring to exterminate or drive out the other. It\nspreads swiftly not only to blood-kin and relatives by marriage, but to\nfriends and retainers as well. It may lie dormant for a time, perhaps\nfor a generation, and then burst forth with recruited strength long\nafter its original cause has ceased to interest anyone, or maybe after\nit has been forgotten.\n\nSuch feuds are by no means prevalent throughout the length and breadth\nof Appalachia, but are restricted mostly to certain well defined\ndistricts, of which the chief, in extent of territory as well as in the\nnumber and ferocity of its \"wars,\" is the country round the upper waters\nof the Kentucky, Licking, Big Sandy, Tug, and Cumberland rivers,\nembracing many of the mountain counties of eastern Kentucky and\nadjoining parts of West Virginia, Old Virginia, and Tennessee. In this\nthinly settled region probably five hundred men have been slain in feuds\nsince our centennial year, and only three of the murderers, so far as I\nknow, have been executed by law.\n\nThe active feudists, as a rule, include only a small part of the\ncommunity; but public sentiment, in feud districts, approves or at least\ntolerates the vendetta, just as it does in Corsica or the Balkans. Those\ncitizens who are not directly implicated take pains to hear little and\nsee less. They keep their mouths shut. They can neither be persuaded,\nbribed, nor coerced into informing or testifying against either side,\nbut, on the contrary, will throw dust in the eyes of an investigator or\ntry to stare him down. A jury composed of such men will not convict\nanybody.\n\nWhen a feud is raging, nobody outside the warring clans is in any danger\nat all. A stranger is safer in the heart of Feuddom than he would be in\nChicago or New York, so long as he attends strictly to his own business,\nasks no questions, and tells no \"tales.\" If, on the contrary, he should\nexpress horror or curiosity, he is regarded as a busybody or suspected\nas a spy, and is likely to be run out of the country or even \"laywayed\"\nand silenced forever.\n\nWhat causes feuds?\n\nSome of them start in mere drunken rows or in a dispute over a game of\ncards; others in quarrels over land boundaries or other property. The\nHatfield-McCoy feud started because Randolph McCoy penned up two wild\nhogs that were claimed by Floyd Hatfield. The spite over these hogs\nbroke out two years later, and one partisan was killed from ambush. The\nfeud itself began in 1882 over a debt of $1.75, with the hogs and the\nbushwhacking brought up in recrimination. Love of women is the primary\ncause, or the secondary aggravation, of many a feud. Some of the most\nwidespread and deadliest vendettas have originated in political strifes.\n\nIt should be understood that national and state politics cut little or\nno figure in these \"wars.\" Local politics in most of the mountain\ncounties is merely a factional fight, in which family matters and\nbusiness interests are involved, and the contest becomes bitterly\npersonal on that account. This explains most of the collusion or\npartisanship of county officers and their remissness in enforcing the\nlaw in murder cases. Family ties or political alliances override even\nthe oath of office.\n\nWithin the past year I have heard a deputy sheriff admit nonchalantly,\non the stand, that when a homicide was committed near him, and he was\nthe only officer in the vicinity, he advised the slayer to take to the\nmountains and \"hide out.\" The judge questioned him sharply on this\npoint, was reassured by the witness that it was so, and then--offered no\ncomment at all. Within the same period, in another but not distant\ncourt, a desperado from the Shelton Laurel, on trial for murder,\nadmitted that he had shot six men since he moved over from Tennessee to\nNorth Carolina, and swore that while he was being held in jail pending\ntrial for this last offense the sheriff permitted him to \"keep a gun in\nhis cell, drink whiskey in the jail, and eat at table with the family of\nthe sheriff.\"\n\nFeuds spread not only through clan fealty but also because they offer\nexcellent chances to pay off old scores. The mountaineer has a long\nmemory. The average highlander is fiery and combative by nature, but at\nthe same time cunning and vindictive. If publicly insulted he will\nstrike at once, but if he feels wronged by some act that does not demand\ninstant retaliation he will brood over it and plot patiently to get his\nenemy at a disadvantage. Some mountaineers always fight fair; but many\nof them prefer to wait and watch quietly until the foe gets drunk and\nunwary, or until he is engaged in some illegal or scandalous act, or\nuntil he is known to be carrying a concealed weapon, whereupon he can be\nshot down unexpectedly and his assailant can \"prove\" by friendly\nwitnesses that he acted in self-defense. So, if a man be involved in\nfeud, he may be assassinated from ambush by someone who is not concerned\nin the clan trouble, but who has hated him for years on another account,\nand who knows that his death now will be charged up to the opposing\nfaction.\n\nFrom the earliest times it has been customary for our highlanders to go\narmed most of the time. This was a necessity in the old Indian-fighting\ndays, and throughout the kukluxing and white-capping era following the\nCivil War. Such a habit, once formed, is hard to eradicate. Even to-day,\nin all parts of Appalachia that I am familiar with, most of the young\nmen, I judge, and many of the older ones, carry concealed weapons.\n\nAmong them I have never seen a stand-up and knock-down fight according\nto the rules of the ring. They have many rough-and-tumble brawls, in\nwhich they slug, wrestle, kick, bite, strangle, until one gets the other\ndown, whereat the one on top continues to maul his victim until he cries\n\"Enough!\" Oftener a club or stone will be used in mad endeavor to knock\nthe opponent senseless at a blow. There is no compunction about striking\nfoul and very little about \"double-teaming.\" Let us pause long enough to\nadmit that this was the British and American way of man-handling,\nuniversal among the common people, until well into the nineteenth\ncentury--and the mountaineers are still ignorant of any other, except\nfighting with weapons.\n\nMany of the young men carry home-made billies or \"brass knucks.\" Every\nman and boy has at least a pocket-knife with serviceable blade. Fights\nwith such crude weapons are frequent. There are few spectacles more\nsickening than two powerful but awkward men slashing each other with\ncommon jack-knives, though the fatalities are much less frequent than in\ngun-fighting. I have known two old mountain preachers to draw knives on\neach other at the close of a sermon.\n\nThe typical highland bravo always carries a revolver or an automatic\npistol. This is likely to be a weapon of large bore and good\nstopping-power that is worn in a shoulder-holster concealed under the\ncoat or vest or shirt. Most mountaineers are good shots with such arms,\nthough not so deadly quick as the frontiersmen of our old-time West--in\nfact, they cannot be so quick without wearing the weapon exposed. When a\nhighlander has time, he prefers to hold his pistol in both hands (left\nclasped over right) and aims it as he would a rifle. To a Westerner such\ngun practice looks absurd; but it is accurate, beyond question. Few\nmountain gun-fights fail to score at least one victim.\n\nThe average mountain woman is as combative in spirit as her menfolk. She\nwould despise any man who took insult or injury without showing fight.\nIn fact, the woman, in many cases, deliberately stirs up trouble out of\nvanity, or for the sheer excitement of it. Some of the older women\ndisplay the ferocity of she-wolves. The mother of a large family said in\nmy presence, with the calm earnestness of one fully experienced: \"If a\nfeller 'd treated me the way ------ did ------ I'd git me a\nforty-some-odd and shoot enough meat off o' his bones to feed a\nhound-dog a week.\" Three of this woman's brothers had been shot dead in\nfrays. One of them killed the first husband of her sister, who married\nagain, and whose second husband was killed by a man with whom she then\ntried a third matrimonial venture. Such matters may not be interesting\nin themselves, but they give one pause when he learns, in addition, that\nthese people are received as friends and on a footing of equality by\neverybody in their community.\n\nThat the mountaineers are fierce and relentless in their feuds is beyond\ndenial. A warfare of bushwhacking and assassination knows no\nrefinements. Quarter is neither given nor expected. Property, however,\nis not violated, and women are not often injured. There have been some\natrocious exceptions. In the Hatfield-McCoy feud, Cap Hatfield and Tom\nWallace attacked the latter's wife and her mother at night, dragged both\nwomen from bed, and Cap beat the old woman with a cow's tail that he had\nclipped off \"jes' to see 'er jump.\" He broke two of the woman's ribs,\nleaving her injured for life, while Tom beat his wife. Later, on New\nYear's night, 1888, a gang of the Hatfields surrounded the home of\nRandolph McCoy, killed the eldest daughter, Allaphare, broke her\nmother's ribs and knocked her senseless with their guns, and killed a\nson, Calvin. In several instances women who fought in defense of their\nhomes have been killed, as in the case of Mrs. Charles Daniels and her\n16-year-old daughter, in Pike County, Kentucky, in November, 1909.\n\nThe mountain women do not shrink from feuds, but on the contrary excite\nand cheer their men to desperate deeds, and sometimes fight by their\nside. In the French-Eversole feud, a woman, learning that her unarmed\nhusband was besieged by his foes, seized his rifle, filled her apron\nwith cartridges, rushed past the firing-line, and stood by her \"old man\"\nuntil he beat his assailants off. When men are \"hiding out\" in the\nlaurel, it is the women's part, which they never shirk, to carry them\nfood and information.\n\nIn every feud each clan has a leader, a man of prominence either on\naccount of his wealth or his political influence or his shrewdness or\nhis physical prowess. This leader's orders are obeyed, while hostilities\nlast, with the same unquestioning loyalty that the old Scotch retainer\nshowed to his chieftain. Either the leader or someone acting for him\nsupplies the men with food, with weapons if they need them, with\nammunition, and with money. Sometimes mercenaries are hired. Mr. Fox\nsays that \"In one local war, I remember, four dollars per day were the\nwages of the fighting man, and the leader on one occasion, while\nbesieging his enemies--in the county court-house--tried to purchase a\ncannon, and from no other place than the State arsenal, and from no\nother personage than the Governor himself.\" In some of the feuds\nprofessional bravos have been employed who would assassinate, for a few\ndollars, anybody who was pointed out to them, provided he was alien to\ntheir own clans.\n\nThe character of the highland bravo is precisely that of the western\n\"bad man\" as pictured by Jed Parker in Stewart Edward White's _Arizona\nNights_:\n\n     \"'There's a good deal of romance been written about the \"bad man,\"\n     and there's about the same amount of nonsense. The bad man is just\n     a plain murderer, neither more nor less. He never does get into a\n     real, good, plain, stand-up gun-fight if he can possibly help it.\n     His killin's are done from behind a door, or when he's got his man\n     dead to rights. There's Sam Cook. You've all heard of him. He had\n     nerve, of course, and when he was backed into a corner he made\n     good; and he was sure sudden death with a gun. But when he went out\n     for a man deliberate, he didn't take no special chances....\n\n     \"'The point is that these yere bad men are a low-down, miserable\n     proposition, and plain, cold-blooded murderers, willin' to wait for\n     a sure thing, and without no compunctions whatever. The bad man\n     takes you unawares, when you're sleepin', or talkin', or drinkin',\n     or lookin' to see what for a day it's goin' to be, anyway. He don't\n     give you no show, and sooner or later he's goin' to get you in the\n     safest and easiest way for himself. There ain't no romance about\n     that.'\"\n\n\nAnd there is no romance about a real mountain feud. It is marked by\nsuave treachery, \"double-teaming,\" \"laywaying,\" \"blind-shooting,\" and\ngeneral heartlessness and brutality. If one side refuses to assassinate\nbut seeks open, honorable combat, as has happened in several feuds, it\nis sure to be beaten. Whoever appeals to the law is sure to be beaten.\nIn either case he is considered a fool or a coward by most of the\ncountryside. Our highlander, untouched by the culture of the world about\nhim, has never been taught the meaning of fair play. Magnanimity to a\nfallen foe he would regard as sure proof of an addled brain. The motive\nof one who forgives his enemy is utterly beyond his comprehension. As\nfor bushwhacking, \"Hit's as fa'r for one as 'tis for t'other. You can't\nfight a man fa'r and squar who'll shoot you in the back. A pore man\ncan't fight money in the courts.\" In this he is simply his ancient\nScotch or English ancestor born over again. Such was the code of\nJacobite Scotland and Tudor England. And _back there_ is where our\nmountaineer belongs in the scale of human evolution.\n\nThe feud, as Miss Miles puts it, is an outbreak of _perverted_ family\naffection. Its mainspring is an honorable clan loyalty. It is a direct\nconsequence of the clan organization that our mountaineers preserve as\nit was handed down to them by their forefathers. The implacability of\ntheir vengeance, the treacheries they practice, the murders from ambush,\nare invariable features of clan warfare wherever and by whomsoever it is\nwaged. They are not vices or crimes peculiar to the Kentuckian or the\nCorsican or the Sicilian or the Albanian or the Arab, but natural\nresults of clan government, which in turn is a result of isolation, of\nphysical environment, of geographical position unfavorable to free\nintercourse and commerce with the world at large.\n\nThe most hideous feature of the feud is the shooting down of unarmed or\nunwarned men. Assassination, in our modern eyes, is the last and lowest\ninfamy of a coward. Such it truly is, when committed in the civilized\nsociety of our day. But in studying primitive races, or in going back\nalong the line of our own ancestry to the civilized society of two\ncenturies ago, we must face and acknowledge the strange paradox of a\nvalorous and honorable people (according to their lights) who, in\ncertain cases, practiced assassination without compunction and, in fact,\nwith pride. History is red with it in those very \"richest ages of our\nrace\" that Professor Shaler cited. Until a century or two ago,\nthroughout Christendom, the secret murder of enemies was committed\nunblushingly by nobles and kings and prelates, often with a pious \"Thus\nsayeth the Lord!\" It was practiced by men valiant in open battle, and by\nthose wise in the counsels of the realm. Take Scotland, for example, as\npictured by a native writer.--\n\n     \"No tenet nor practice, no influence nor power nor principality in\n     the Scotland of the past has outvied assassination in ascendancy or\n     in moment. Not theoretically, indeed, but practically, it occupied\n     for centuries a distinct, almost a supreme, place in her political\n     constitution--was, in fact, the understood if not recognized\n     expedient always in reserve should other milder and more hallowed\n     methods fail of accomplishing the desired political or, it might\n     be, religious consummation....\n\n     \"For centuries such justice as was exercised was haphazard and\n     rude, and practically there was no law but the will of the\n     stronger. Few, if any, of the great families but had their special\n     feud; and feuds once originated survived for ages; to forget them\n     would have been treason to the dead, and wild purposes of revenge\n     were handed down from generation to generation as a sacred legacy.\n\n     \"To take an enemy at a disadvantage was not deemed mean and\n     contemptible, but--\n\n       'Of all the arts in which the wise excel\n       Nature's chief masterpiece.'\n\n     To do it boldly and adroitly was to win a peculiar halo of renown;\n     and thus assassination ceased to be the weapon of the avowed\n     desperado, and came to be wielded unblushingly not only by\n     so-called men of honor, but by the so-called religious as well. A\n     noble did not scruple to use it against his king, and the king\n     himself felt no dishonor in resorting to it against a dangerous\n     noble. James I. was hacked to death in the night by Sir Robert\n     Graham; and James I. rid himself of the imperious and intriguing\n     Douglas by suddenly stabbing him while within his own royal palace\n     under protection of a safe conduct.\n\n     \"The leaders of the Reformation discerned in assassination (that of\n     their enemies) the special 'work and judgment of God.'... When the\n     assassination of Cardinal Beaton took place in 1546, all the savage\n     details of it were set down by Knox with unbridled gusto. 'These\n     things we wreat mearlie,' is his own ingenuous comment on his\n     performance.\n\n     \"The burden of George Buchanan's _De Jure Regni apud Scotos_ is the\n     lawfulness or righteousness of the removal--by assassination or any\n     other fitting or convenient means--of incompetent kings, whether\n     heinously wicked and tyrannical or merely unwise and weak of\n     purpose; and he cites as a case in point and an 'example in time\n     coming,' the murder of James III., which, if it were only on\n     account of the assassin's hideous travesty of the last offices of\n     the Church, would deserve to be held in unique and everlasting\n     detestation.\"--(Henderson, _Old-world Scotland_, 182-186.)\n\n\nYet the Scots have always been a notably warlike and fearless race. So,\ntoo, are our southern mountaineers: in the Civil War and the Spanish War\nthey sent a larger proportion of their men into the service than almost\nany other section of our country.\n\nLet us not overlook the fact that it demands courage of a high order for\none to stay in a feud-infested district, conscious of being marked for\nslaughter--stay there month in and month out, year in and year out, not\nknowing at what moment he may be beset by overpowering numbers, from\nwhat laurel thicket he may be shot, or at what hour of the night he may\nbe called to his door and struck dead before his family. On the credit\nside of their valor, then, be it entered that few mountaineers will\nshrink from such ordeal when, even from no fault of their own, it is\nthrust upon them.\n\nThe blood-feud is simply a horrible survival of medievalism. It is the\nhighlander's misfortune to be stranded far out of the course of\ncivilization. He is no worse than that bygone age that he really belongs\nto. In some ways he is better. He is far less cruel than his ancestors\nwere--than our ancestors were. He does not torture with the tumbril,\nthe stocks, the ducking-stool, the pillory, the branding-irons, the\near-pruners and nostril-shears and tongue-branks that were in everyday\nuse under the old criminal code. He does not tie a woman to the cart's\ntail and publicly lash her bare back until it streams with blood, nor\ndoes he hang a man for picking somebody's pocket of twelve pence and a\nfarthing. He does not go slumming in bedlam, paying tuppence for the\nsport of mocking the maniacs until they rattle their chains in rage or\nhorror. He does not turn executions of criminals into public festivals.\nHe never has been known to burn a condemned one at the stake. If he\nhangs a man, he does not first draw his entrails and burn them before\nhis eyes, with a mob crowding about to jeer the poor devil's flinching\nor to compliment him on his \"nerve.\" Yet all these pleasantries were\nproper and legal in Christian Britain two centuries ago.\n\nThis isolated and belated people who still carry on the blood-feud are\nnot half so much to blame for such a savage survival as the rich,\npowerful, educated, twentieth-century nation that abandons them as if\nthey were hopelessly derelict or wrecked. It took but a few decades to\ncivilize Scotland. How much swifter and surer and easier are our means\nof enlightenment to-day! Let us not forget that these highlanders are\nblood of our blood and bone of our bone; for they are old-time Americans\nto a man, proud of their nationality, and passionately loyal to the flag\nthat they, more than any other of us, according to their strength, have\nfought and suffered for.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nWHO ARE THE MOUNTAINEERS?\n\n\nThe Southern Appalachian Mountains happen to be parceled out among eight\ndifferent States, and for that reason they are seldom considered as a\ngeographical unit. In the same way their inhabitants are thought of as\nKentucky mountaineers or Carolina mountaineers, and so on, but not often\nas a body of Appalachian mountaineers. And yet these inhabitants are as\ndistinct an ethnographic group as the mountains themselves are a\ngeographic group.\n\nThe mountaineers are homogeneous so far as speech and manners and\nexperiences and ideals can make them. In the aggregate they are nearly\ntwice as numerous and cover twice as much territory as any one of the\nStates among which they have been distributed; but in each of these\nStates they occupy only the backyard, and generally take back seats in\nthe councils of the commonwealth. They have been fenced off from each\nother by political boundaries, and have no such coherence among\nthemselves as would come from common leadership or a sense of common\norigin and mutual dependence.\n\nAnd they are a people without annals. Back of their grandfathers they\nhave neither screed nor hearsay. \"Borned in the kentry and ain't never\nbeen out o' hit\" is all that most of them can say for themselves. Here\nand there one will assert, \"My foreparents war principally Scotch,\" or\n\"Us Bumgyarners [Baumgartners] was Dutch,\" but such traditions of a\nfar-back foreign origin are uncommon.\n\nWho are these southern mountaineers? Whence came they? What is the\nsecret of their belatedness and isolation?\n\nBefore the Civil War they were seldom heard of in the outside world.\nVaguely it was understood that the Appalachian highlands were occupied\nby a peculiar people called \"mountain whites.\" This odd name was given\nthem not to distinguish them from mountain negroes, for there were,\npractically, no mountain negroes; but to indicate their similarity, in\nsocial condition and economic status, to the \"poor whites\" of the\nsouthern lowlands. It was assumed, on no historical basis whatever, that\nthe highlanders came from the more venturesome or desperate element of\nthe \"poor whites,\" and differed from these only to the extent that\nenvironment had shaped them.\n\nSince this theory still prevails throughout the South, and is accepted\ngenerally elsewhere on its face value, it deserves just enough\nconsideration to refute it.\n\nThe unfortunate class known as poor whites in the South is descended\nmainly from the convicts and indentured servants with which England\nsupplied labor to the southern plantations before slavery days. The\nCavaliers who founded and dominated southern society came from the\nconservative, the feudal element of England. Their character and\ntraining were essentially aristocratic and military. They were not\ntown-dwellers, but masters of plantations. Their chief crop and article\nof export was tobacco. The culture of tobacco required an abundance of\ncheap and servile labor.\n\nOn the plantations there was little demand for skilled labor, small room\nanywhere for a middle class of manufacturers and merchants, no\ninducement for independent farmers who would till with their own hands.\nOutside of the planters and a small professional class there was little\nemployment offered save what was menial and degrading. Consequently the\nSouth was shunned, from the beginning, by British yeomanry and by the\nthrifty Teutons such as flocked into the northern provinces. The demand\nfor menials on the plantations was met, then, by importing bond-servants\nfrom Great Britain. These were obtained in three ways.--\n\n1. Convicted criminals were deported to serve out their terms on the\nplantations. Some of these had been charged only with political\noffenses, and had the making of good citizens; but the greater number\nwere rogues of the shiftless and petty delinquent order, such as were\ntoo lazy to work but not desperate enough to have incurred capital\nsentences.\n\n2. Boys and girls, chiefly from the slums of British seaports, were\nkidnapped and sold into temporary slavery on the plantations.\n\n3. Impoverished people who wished to emigrate, but could not pay for\ntheir passage, voluntarily sold their services for a term of years in\nreturn for transportation.\n\nThus a considerable proportion of the white laborers of the South, in\nthe seventeenth century, were criminals or ne'er-do-wells from the\nstart. A large number of the others came from the dregs of society. As\nfor the remainder, the companionships into which they were thrust, the\nbrutalities to which they were subjected, their impotence before the\nlaw, the contempt in which they were held by the ruling caste, and the\nwretchedness of their prospect when released, were enough to undermine\nall but the strongest characters. Few ever succeeded in rising to\nrespectable positions.\n\nThen came a vast social change. At a time when the laboring classes of\nEurope had achieved emancipation from serfdom, and feudalism was\noverthrown, African slavery in our own Southland laid the foundation for\na new feudalism. Southern society reverted to a type that the rest of\nthe civilized world had outgrown.\n\nThe effect upon white labor was deplorable. The former bond-servants\nwere now freedmen, it is true, but freedmen shorn of such opportunities\nas they were fitted to use. Sprung from a more or less degraded stock,\nstill branded by caste, untrained to any career demanding skill and\nintelligence, devitalized by evil habits of life, densely ignorant of\nthe world around them, these, the naturally shiftless, were now turned\nout into the backwoods to shift for themselves. It was inevitable that\nmost of them should degenerate even below the level of their former\nestate, for they were no longer forced into steady industry.\n\nThe white freedmen generally became squatters on such land as was unfit\nfor tobacco, cotton, and other crops profitable to slave-owners. As the\nplantations expanded, these freedmen were pushed further and further\nback upon more and more sterile soil. They became \"pine-landers\" or\n\"piney-woods-people,\" \"sand-hillers,\" \"knob-people,\" \"corn-crackers\" or\n\"crackers,\" gaining a bare subsistence from corn planted and \"tended\"\nchiefly by the women and children, from hogs running wild in the forest,\nand from desultory hunting and fishing. As a class, such whites lapsed\ninto sloth and apathy. Even the institution of slavery they regarded\nwith cynical tolerance, doubtless realizing that if it were not for the\nblacks they would be slaves themselves.\n\nNow these poor whites had nothing to do with settling the mountains.\nThere was then, and still is, plenty of wild land for them in their\nnative lowlands. They had neither the initiative nor the courage to seek\na promised land far away among the unexplored and savage peaks of the\nwestern country. They were a brave enough folk in facing familiar\ndangers, but they had a terror of the unknown, being densely ignorant\nand superstitious. The mountains, to those who ever heard of them,\nsuggested nothing but laborious climbing amid mysterious and portentous\nperils. The poor whites were not highlanders by descent, nor had they a\nwhit of the bold, self-reliant spirit of our western pioneers. They\nnever entered Appalachia until after it had been won and settled by a\nfar manlier race, and even then they went only in driblets. The theory\nthat the southern mountains were peopled mainly by outcasts or refugees\nfrom old settlements in the lowlands rests on no other basis than\nimagination.\n\nHow the mountains actually were settled is another and a very different\nstory.--\n\nThe first frontiersmen of the Appalachians were those Swiss and Palatine\nGermans who began flocking into Pennsylvania about 1682. They settled\nwestward of the Quakers in the fertile limestone belts at the foot of\nthe Blue Ridge and the Alleghanies. Here they formed the Quakers' buffer\nagainst the Indians, and, for some time, theirs were the westernmost\nsettlements of British subjects in America. These Germans were of the\nReformed or Lutheran faith. They were strongly democratic in a social\nsense, and detested slavery. They were model farmers and many of them\nwere skilled workmen at trades.\n\nShortly after the tide of German immigration set into Pennsylvania,\nanother and quite different class of foreigners began to arrive in this\nprovince, attracted hither by the same lodestones that drew the Germans,\nnamely, democratic institutions and religious liberty. These newcomers\nwere the Scotch-Irish, or Ulstermen of Ireland.\n\nWhen James I., in 1607, confiscated the estates of the native Irish in\nsix counties of Ulster, he planted them with Scotch and English\nPresbyterians. These outsiders came to be known as Scotch-Irish, because\nthey were chiefly of Scotch blood and had settled in Ireland. The native\nIrish, to whom they were alien both by blood and by religion, detested\nthem as usurpers, and fought them many a bloody battle.\n\nIn time, as their leases in Ulster began to expire, the Scotch-Irish\nthemselves came in conflict with the Crown, by whom they were persecuted\nand evicted. Then the Ulstermen began immigrating in large numbers to\nPennsylvania. As Froude says, \"In the two years that followed the Antrim\nevictions, thirty thousand Protestants left Ulster for a land where\nthere was no legal robbery, and where those who sowed the seed could\nreap the harvest.\"\n\nSo it was that these people became, in their turn, our westernmost\nfrontiersmen, taking up land just outside the German settlements.\nImmediately they began to clash with the Indians, and there followed a\nlong series of border wars, waged with extreme ferocity, in which\nsometimes it is hard to say which side was most to blame. One thing,\nhowever, is certain: if any race was ordained to exterminate the Indians\nthat race was the Scotch-Irish.\n\nThey were a brave but hot-headed folk, as might be expected of a people\nwho for a century had been planted amid hostile Hibernians. Justin\nWinsor describes them as having \"all that excitable character which goes\nwith a keen-minded adherence to original sin, total depravity,\npredestination, and election,\" and as seeing \"no use in an Indian but to\nbe a target for their bullets.\" They were quick-witted as well as\nquick-tempered, rather visionary, imperious, and aggressive.\n\nBeing by tradition and habit a border people the Scotch-Irish pushed to\nthe extreme western fringe of settlement amid the Alleghanies. They were\nnot over-solicitous about the quality of soil. When Arthur Lee, of\nVirginia, was telling Doctor Samuel Johnson, in London, of a colony of\nScotch who had settled upon a particularly sterile tract in western\nVirginia, and had expressed his wonder that they should do so, Johnson\nreplied, \"Why, sir, all barrenness is comparative: the Scotch will never\nknow that it is barren.\"\n\nWest of the Susquehanna, however, the land was so rocky and poor that\neven the Scotch shied at it, and so, when eastern Pennsylvania became\ncrowded, the overflow of settlers passed not westward but southwestward,\nalong the Cumberland Valley, into western Maryland, and then into the\nShenandoah and those other long, narrow, parallel valleys of western\nVirginia that we noted in our first chapter. This western region still\nlay unoccupied and scarcely known by the Virginians themselves. Its\nfertile lands were discovered by Pennsylvania Dutchmen. The first house\nin western Virginia was erected by one of them, Joist Hite, and he\nestablished a colony of his people near the future site of Winchester. A\nmajority of those who settled in the eastern part of the Shenandoah\nValley were Pennsylvania Dutch, while the Scotch-Irish, following in\ntheir train, pushed a little to the west of them and occupied more\nexposed positions. There were representatives of other races along the\nborder: English, Irish, French Huguenots, and so on; but everywhere the\nScotch-Irish and Germans predominated.\n\nAnd the southwestward movement, once started, never stopped. So there\nwent on a gradual but sure progress of northern peoples across the\nPotomac, up the Shenandoah, across the Staunton, the Dan, the Yadkin,\nuntil the western piedmont and foot-hill region of Carolina was\nsimilarly settled, chiefly by Pennsylvanians.\n\nThe archivist of North Carolina, the late William L. Saunders, Secretary\nof State, said in one of his historical sketches that \"to Lancaster and\nYork counties, in Pennsylvania, North Carolina owes more of her\npopulation than to any other known part of the world.\" He called\nattention to the interesting fact that when the North Carolina boys of\nScotch-Irish and Pennsylvania Dutch descent followed Lee into\nPennsylvania in the Gettysburg campaign, they were returning to the\nhomes of their ancestors, by precisely the same route that those\nancestors had taken in going south.\n\nAmong those who made the long trek from Pennsylvania southward in the\neighteenth century, were Daniel Boone and the ancestors of David\nCrockett, Samuel Houston, John C. Calhoun, \"Stonewall\" Jackson, and\nAbraham Lincoln. Boone and the Lincolns, although English themselves,\nhad been neighbors in Berks County, one of the most German parts of all\neastern Pennsylvania.\n\nSo the western piedmont and the mountains were settled neither by\nCavaliers nor by poor whites, but by a radically distinct and even\nantagonistic people who are appropriately called the Roundheads of the\nSouth. These Roundheads had little or nothing to do with slavery,\ndetested the state church, loathed tithes, and distrusted all authority\nsave that of conspicuous merit and natural justice. The first\ncharacteristic that these pioneers developed was an intense\nindividualism. The strong and even violent independence that made them\nforsake all the comforts of civilization and prefer the wild freedom of\nthe border was fanned at times into turbulence and riot; but it blazed\nforth at a happy time for this country when our liberties were\nimperilled.\n\nDaniel Boone first appears in history when, from his new home on the\nYadkin, he crossed the Blue Ridge and the Unakas into that part of\nwestern Carolina which is now eastern Tennessee. He was exploring the\nWatauga region as early as 1760. Both British and French Indian traders\nand soldiers had been in this region before him, but had left few marks\nof their wanderings. In 1761 a party of hunters from Pennsylvania and\ncontiguous counties of Virginia, piloted by Boone, began to use this\nregion as a hunting-ground, on account of the great abundance of game.\nFrom them, and especially from Boone, the fame of its attractions spread\nto the settlements on the eastern slope of the mountains, and in the\nwinter of 1768-69 the first permanent occupation of eastern Tennessee\nwas made by a few families from North Carolina.\n\nAbout this time there broke out in Carolina a struggle between the\nindependent settlers of the piedmont and the rich trading and official\nclass of the coast. The former rose in bodies under the name of\nRegulators and a battle followed in which they were defeated. To escape\nfrom the persecutions of the aristocracy, many of the Regulators and\ntheir friends crossed the Appalachian Mountains and built their cabins\nin the Watauga region. Here, in 1772, there was established by these\n\"rebels\" the first republic in America, based upon a written\nconstitution \"the first ever adopted by a community of American-born\nfreemen.\" Of these pioneers in \"The Winning of the West,\" Theodore\nRoosevelt says: \"As in western Virginia the first settlers came, for the\nmost part, from Pennsylvania, so, in turn, in what was then western\nNorth Carolina, and is now eastern Tennessee, the first settlers came\nmainly from Virginia, and indeed, in great part, from this same\nPennsylvania stock.\"\n\nBoone first visited Kentucky, on a hunting trip, in 1769. Six years\nlater he began to colonize it, in flat defiance of the British\ngovernment, and in the face of a menacing proclamation from the royal\ngovernor of North Carolina. On the Kentucky River, three days after the\nbattle of Lexington, the flag of the new colony of Transylvania was run\nup on his fort at Boonesborough. It was not until the following August\nthat these \"rebels of Kentuck\" heard of the signing of the Declaration\nof Independence, and celebrated it with shrill warwhoops around a\nbonfire in the center of their stockade.\n\nSuch was the stuff of which the Appalachian frontiersmen were made. They\nwere the first Americans to cut loose entirely from the seaboard and\nfall back upon their own resources. They were the first to establish\ngovernments of their own, in defiance of king and aristocracy. Says John\nFiske:\n\n     \"Jefferson is often called the father of modern American democracy;\n     in a certain sense the Shenandoah Valley and adjacent Appalachian\n     regions may be called its cradle. In that rude frontier society,\n     life assumed many new aspects, old customs were forgotten, old\n     distinctions abolished, social equality acquired even more\n     importance than unchecked individualism. The notions, sometimes\n     crude and noxious, sometimes just and wholesome, which\n     characterized Jeffersonian democracy, flourished greatly on the\n     frontier and have thence been propagated eastward through the older\n     communities, affecting their legislation and their politics more or\n     less according to frequency of contact and intercourse.\n     Massachusetts, relatively remote and relatively ancient, has been\n     perhaps least affected by this group of ideas, but all parts of the\n     United States have felt its influence powerfully. This phase of\n     democracy, which is destined to continue so long as frontier life\n     retains any importance, can nowhere be so well studied in its\n     beginnings as among the Presbyterian population of the Appalachian\n     region in the 18th century.\"\n\n\nDuring the Revolution, the Appalachian frontier was held by a double\nline of the men whom we have been considering: one line east of the\nmountains, and the other west of them. The mountain region itself\nremained almost uninhabited by whites, because the pioneers who crossed\nit were seeking better hunting grounds and farmsteads than the mountains\nafforded. It was not until the buffalo and elk and beaver had been\ndriven out of Tennessee and Kentucky, and those rolling savannahs were\nbeing fenced and tilled, that much attention was given to the mountains\nproper. Then small companies of hunters and trappers from both east and\nwest began to move into the highlands and settle there.\n\nThese explorers, pushing outward from the cross-mountain trails in every\ndirection, found many interesting things that had been overlooked in the\nscurry of migration westward. They discovered fair river valleys and\nrich coves, adapted to tillage, which soon attracted settlers of a\nbetter class; and so, gradually, the mountain solitudes began to echo\nwith the ring of axes and the lowing of herds. By 1830 about a million\npermanent settlers occupied the southern Appalachians. Naturally, most\nof them came from adjoining regions--from the foot of the Blue Ridge on\none side and from the foot of the Unakas or of the Cumberlands on the\nother, and hence they were chiefly of the same frontier stock that we\nhave been describing. No colonies of farmers from a distance ever have\nbeen imported into the mountains, down to our own day.\n\nDeterioration of the mountain people began as soon as population began\nto press upon the limits of subsistence. At first, naturally, the best\npeople among the mountaineers were attracted to the best lands. And\nthere to-day, in the generous river valleys, we find a class of\ncitizens superior to the average mountaineers that we have been\nconsidering in this book. But the number and extent of such valleys was\nnarrowly limited. The United States topographers report that in\nAppalachia, as a whole, the mountain slopes occupy 90 per cent. of the\ntotal area, and that 85 per cent. of the land has a steeper slope than\none foot in five. So, as the years passed, a larger and larger\nproportion of the highlanders was forced back along the creek branches\nand up along the steep hillsides to \"scrabble\" for a living.\n\nIt will be asked, Why did not this overplus do as other crowded\nAmericans did: move west?\n\nFirst, because they were so immured in the mountains, so utterly cut off\nfrom communication with the outer world, that they did not know anything\nabout the opportunities offered new settlers in far-away lands. Moving\n\"west\" to them would have meant merely going a few days' wagon-travel\ndown into the lowlands of Kentucky or Tennessee, which already were\nthickly settled by a people of very different social class. Here they\ncould not hope to be anything but tenants or menials, ruled over by\nproprietors or bosses--and they would die rather than endure such\ntreatment. As for the new lands of the farther West, there was scarce a\npeasant in Ireland or in Scandinavia but knew more about them than did\nthe southern mountaineers.\n\nSecond, because they were passionately attached to their homes and\nkindred, to their own old-fashioned ways. The mountaineer shrinks from\nlowland society as he does from the water and the climate of such\nregions. He is never at ease until back with his home-folks, foot-loose\nand free.\n\nThird, because there was nothing in his environment to arouse ambition.\nThe hard, hopeless life of the mountain farm, sustained only by a meager\nand ill-cooked diet, begat laziness and shiftless unconcern.\n\nFinally, the poverty of the hillside farmers and branch-water people was\nso extreme that they could not gather funds to emigrate with. There were\nno industries to which a man might turn and earn ready money, no markets\nin which he could sell a surplus from the farm.\n\nSo, while the transmontane settlers grew rapidly in wealth and culture,\ntheir kinsfolk back in the mountains either stood still or retrograded,\nand the contrast was due not nearly so much to any difference of\ncapacity as to a law of Nature that dooms an isolated and impoverished\npeople to deterioration.\n\nBeyond this, it is not to be overlooked that the mountains were cursed\nwith a considerable incubus of naturally weak or depraved characters,\nnot lowland \"poor whites,\" but a miscellaneous flotsam from all\nquarters, which, after more or less circling round and round, was drawn\ninto the stagnant eddy of highland society as derelicts drift into the\nSargasso Sea. In the train of western immigration there were some feeble\nsouls who never got across the mountains. These have been described\ntersely as the men who lost heart on account of a broken axle.\n\nThe anemic element thus introduced is less noticeable in Kentucky than\nin Virginia and the States farther south--for the reason, no doubt, that\nit took at least two axles to reach Kentucky--but it exists in all parts\nof Appalachia. Moreover, the vast roughs of the mountain region offered\nharborage for outlaws, desperadoes of the border, and here many of them\nsettled and propagated their kind. In the backwoods one cannot choose\nhis neighbors. All are on equal footing. Hence the contagion of crime\nand shiftlessness spreads to decent families and tends to undermine\nthem.\n\nWe can understand, then, how it happened in many cases that highland\nfamilies founded by well-informed and thrifty pioneers deteriorated\ninto illiterate and idle triflers, all run down at heels. Lincoln's\nfamily is an apt illustration. His grandfather sold his Virginia farms\nfor seventeen thousand dollars and bought large tracts of land in\nKentucky. But Abraham Lincoln's father set up housekeeping in a shed,\nlater built a log hut of one room without doors or windows (although he\nwas a carpenter by trade), then moved to another cabin a little better,\ntired of it, moved over into Indiana, and made his family spend the\nwinter in a half-faced camp, where they were saved from freezing by\nkeeping up a great log fire in front of the lean-to through days and\nnights when the temperature was far below zero. The Lincolns were not\nmountaineers, but they were of the same stock, and were subjected to\nmuch the same vicissitudes.\n\nSo the southern highlanders languished in isolation, sunk in a Rip Van\nWinkle sleep, until aroused by the thunder-crash of the Civil War. Let\nJohn Fox tell the extraordinary result of that awakening.--\n\n     \"The American mountaineer was discovered, I say, at the beginning\n     of the war, when the Confederate leaders were counting on the\n     presumption that Mason and Dixon's Line was the dividing line\n     between the North and South, and formed, therefore, the plan of\n     marching an army from Wheeling, in West Virginia, to some point on\n     the Lakes, and thus dissevering the North at one blow.\n\n     \"The plan seemed so feasible that it is said to have materially\n     aided the sale of Confederate bonds in England. But when Captain\n     Garnett, a West Point graduate, started to carry it out, he got no\n     farther than Harper's Ferry. When he struck the mountains, he\n     struck enemies who shot at his men from ambush, cut down bridges\n     before him, carried the news of his march to the Federals, and\n     Garnett himself fell with a bullet from a mountaineer's squirrel\n     rifle at Harper's Ferry.\n\n     \"Then the South began to realize what a long, lean, powerful arm of\n     the Union it was that the southern mountaineer stretched through\n     its very vitals; for that arm helped hold Kentucky in the Union by\n     giving preponderance to the Union sympathizers in the Blue-grass;\n     it kept the east Tennesseans loyal to the man; it made West\n     Virginia, as the phrase goes, 'secede from secession'; it drew out\n     a horde of one hundred thousand volunteers, when Lincoln called for\n     troops, depleting Jackson County, Kentucky, for instance, of every\n     male under sixty years of age and over fifteen; and it raised a\n     hostile barrier between the armies of the coast and the armies of\n     the Mississippi. The North has never realized, perhaps, what it\n     owes for its victory to this non-slaveholding southern\n     mountaineer.\"\n\n\nPresident Frost, of Berea College, says:\n\n     \"The loyalty of this region in the Civil War was a surprise to both\n     northern and southern statesmen. The mountain people owned land\n     but did not own slaves, and the national feeling of the\n     revolutionary period had not spent its force among them. Their\n     services in West Virginia and east Tennessee are perhaps generally\n     known. But very few know or remember that the whole mountain region\n     was loyal [except where conscripted]. General Carl Schurz had\n     soldiers enlisted in the mountains of Alabama, and the writer has\n     recently seen a letter written by the Confederate Governor of South\n     Carolina in which he relates to General Hardee the troubles caused\n     by Union sentiment in the mountain counties.\n\n     \"It is pathetic to know how these mountain regiments disbanded with\n     no poet or historian or monument to perpetuate the memory of their\n     valor. The very flag that was first on Lookout Mountain and 'waved\n     above the clouds' was lost to fame in an obscure mountain home\n     until Berea discovered and rescued it from oblivion and\n     destruction.\"\n\n\nIt may be added that no other part of our country suffered longer or\nmore severely from the aftermath of war. Throughout that struggle the\nmountain region was a nest for bushwhackers and bandits that preyed upon\nthe aged and defenseless who were left at home, and thus there was left\nan evil legacy of neighborhood wrongs and private grudges. Most of the\nmountain counties had incurred the bitter hostility of their own States\nby standing loyal to the Union. After Appomattox they were cast back\ninto a worse isolation than they had ever known. Most unfortunately,\ntoo, the Federal Government, at this juncture, instead of interposing\nto restore law and order in the highlands, turned the loyalty of the\nmountaineers into outlawry, as in 1794, by imposing a prohibitive excise\ntax upon their chief merchantable commodity.\n\nLeft, then, to their own devices, unchecked by any stronger arm,\ninflamed by a multitude of personal wrongs, habituated to the shedding\nof human blood, contemptuous of State laws that did not reach them,\nenraged by Federal acts that impugned, as they thought, an inalienable\nright of man, it was inevitable that this fiery and vindictive race\nshould fall speedily into warring among themselves. Old scores were now\nto be wiped out in a reign of terror. The open combat of bannered war\nwas turned into the secret ferocity of family feuds.\n\nBut the mountaineers of to-day are face to face with a mighty change.\nThe feud epoch has ceased throughout the greater part of Appalachia. A\nnew era dawns. Everywhere the highways of civilization are pushing into\nremote mountain fastnesses. Vast enterprises are being installed. The\ntimber and the minerals are being garnered. The mighty waterpower that\nhas been running to waste since these mountains rose from the primal sea\nis now about to be harnessed in the service of man. Along with this\neconomic revolution will come, inevitably, good schools, newspapers, a\nfiner and more liberal social life. The highlander, at last, is to be\ncaught up in the current of human progress.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n\"WHEN THE SLEEPER WAKES\"\n\n\nThe southern mountaineers are pre-eminently a rural folk. When the\ntwentieth century opened, only four per cent. of them dwelt in cities of\n8,000 inhabitants and upwards. There were but seven such cities in all\nAppalachia--a region larger than England and Scotland combined--and\nthese owed their development to outside influences. Only 77 out of 186\nmountain counties had towns of 1,000 and upwards.\n\nOur highlanders are the most homogeneous people in the United States. In\n1900, out of a total population of 3,039,835, there were only 18,617 of\nforeign birth. This includes the cities and industrial camps. Back in\nthe mountains, a man using any other tongue than English, or speaking\nbroken English, was regarded as a freak. Nine mountain counties of\nVirginia, four of West Virginia, fifteen of Kentucky, ten of Tennessee,\nnine of North Carolina, eight of Georgia, two of Alabama, and one of\nSouth Carolina had less than ten foreign-born residents each. Three of\nthem had none at all.\n\nCompare the North Atlantic states. In this same census year, 57 per\ncent. of their people lived in cities of 8,000 and upwards. As for\nforeigners--the one city of Fall River, Mass., with 104,863 inhabitants,\nhad 50,042 of foreign birth.\n\nThe mountains proper are free not only from foreigners but from negroes\nas well. There are many blacks in the larger valleys and towns, but\nthroughout most of Appalachia the population is almost exclusively\nwhite. In 1900, Jackson County, Ky. (the same that sent every one of its\nsons into the Union army who could bear arms), had only nineteen negroes\namong 10,542 whites; Johnson County, Ky., only one black resident among\n13,729 whites; Dickenson County, Va., not a single negro within its\nborders.\n\nIn many mountain settlements negroes are not allowed to tarry. It has\nbeen assumed that this prejudice against colored folk had its origin far\nback in the time when \"poor whites\" found themselves thrust aside by\ncompetition with slave labor. This is an error. Our mountaineers never\nhad to compete with slavery. Few of them knew anything about it except\nfrom hearsay. Their dislike of negroes is simply an instinctive racial\nantipathy, plus a contempt for anyone who submits to servile conditions.\nA neighbor in the Smokies said to me: \"I b'lieve in treatin' niggers\nsquar. The Bible says they're human--leastways some says it does--and so\nthere'd orter be a place for them. But it's _some place else_--not\naround me!\" That is the whole thing in a nutshell.\n\nHere, then, is Appalachia: one of the great land-locked areas of the\nglobe, more English in speech than Britain itself, more American by\nblood than any other part of America, encompassed by a high-tensioned\ncivilization, yet less affected to-day by modern ideas, less cognizant\nof modern progress, than any other part of the English-speaking world.\n\nOf course, such an anomaly cannot continue. Commercialism has discovered\nthe mountains at last, and no sentiment, however honest, however\nhallowed, can keep it out. The transformation is swift. Suddenly the\nmountaineer is awakened from his eighteenth-century bed by the blare of\nsteam whistles and the boom of dynamite. He sees his forests leveled and\nwhisked away; his rivers dammed by concrete walls and shot into turbines\nthat outpower all the horses in Appalachia. He is dazed by electric\nlights, nonplussed by speaking wires, awed by vast transfers of\nproperty, incensed by rude demands. Aroused, now, and wide-eyed, he\nrealizes with sinking heart that here is a sudden end of that Old\nDispensation under which he and his ancestors were born, the beginning\nof a New Order that heeds him and his neighbors not a whit.\n\nAll this insults his conservatism. The old way was the established order\nof the universe: to change it is fairly impious. What is the good of all\nthis fuss and fury? That fifty-story building they tell about, in their\nbig city--what is it but another Tower of Babel? And these silly,\nstuck-up strangers who brag and brag about \"modern improvements\"--what\nare they, under their fine manners and fine clothes? Hirelings all.\nShrewdly he observes them in their relations to each other.--\n\n  \"Each man is some man's servant; every soul\n    Is by some other's presence quite discrowned.\"\n\nProudly he contrasts his ragged self: he who never has acknowledged a\nsuperior, never has taken an order from living man, save as a patriot in\ntime of war. And he turns upon his heel.\n\nYet, before he can fairly credit it as a reality, the lands around his\nown home are bought up by corporations. All about him, slash, crash, go\nthe devastating forces. His old neighbors vanish. New and unwelcome ones\nswarm in. He is crowded, but ignored. His hard-earned patrimony is\nrobbed of all that made it precious: its home-like seclusion,\nindependence, dignity. He sells out, and moves away to some uninvaded\nplace where he \"will not be bothered.\"\n\n\"I don't like these improve_ments_,\" said an old mountaineer to me.\n\"Some calls them 'progress,' and says they put money to circulatin'. So\nthey do; but _who gits it_?\"\n\nThere is a class of highlanders more sanguine, more adaptable, that\nwelcomes all outsiders who come with skill and capital to develop their\ncountry. Many of these are shrewd traders in merchandise or in real\nestate, or they are capable foremen who can handle native labor much\nbetter than any strangers could. Such men naturally profit by the\nchange.\n\nOthers, deluded by what seems easy money, sell their little homesteads\nfor just enough cash to set them up as laborers in town or camp. Being\nuntrained to any trade, they can get only the lowest wages, which are\nquickly dissipated in rent and in foods that formerly they raised for\nthemselves. Unused to continuous labor, they irk under its discipline,\ndrop out, and fall into desultory habits. Meantime false ambitions\narise, especially among the womenfolk. Store credit soon runs such a\nfamily in debt.\n\n\"When I was a young man,\" said one of my neighbors, \"the traders never\nthought of bringin' meal in here. If a man run out of meal, why, he was\n_out_, and he had to live on 'taters or somethin' else. Nowadays we\ndress better, and live better, but some other feller allers has his\nhands in our pockets.\"\n\nThen it is \"good-by\" to the old independence that made such characters\nmanly. Enmeshed in obligations that they cannot meet, they struggle\nvainly, brood hopelessly, and lose that dearest of all possessions,\ntheir self-respect. Servility is literal hell to a mountaineer, and when\nit is forced upon him he turns into a mean, underhanded, slinking\nfellow, easily tempted into crime.\n\nThe curse of our invading civilization is that its vanguard is composed\nof men who care nothing for the welfare of the people they dispossess. A\nnorthern lumberman admitted to me, with frankness unusual in his class,\nthat \"All we want here is to get the most we can out of this country, as\nquick as we can, and then get out.\" This is all we can expect of those\nwho exploit raw materials, or of manufactures that employ only cheap\nlabor. Until we have industries that demand skilled workmen, and until\nmanual training schools are established in the mountains, we may look\nfor deterioration, rather than betterment, of those highlanders who\nleave their farms.\n\nAll who know the mountaineers intimately have observed that the sudden\ninroad of commercialism has a bad effect upon them. As President Frost\nsays, \"Ruthless change is knocking at the door of every mountain cabin.\nThe jackals of civilization have already abused the confidence of many a\nhighland home. The lumber, coal, and mineral wealth of the mountains is\nto be possessed, and the unprincipled vanguard of commercialism can\neasily debauch a simple people. The question is whether the mountain\npeople can be enlightened and guided so that they can have a part in the\ndevelopment of their own country, or whether they must give place to\nforeigners and melt away like so many Indians.\"\n\nIt is easy to say that the fittest will survive. But the fittest for\nwhat? Miss Miles answers: \"I have heard it said that civilization, when\nit touches the people of the backwoods, acts as a useful precipitant in\nthus sending the dregs to the bottom. As a matter of fact, it is only\nthe shrewder and more determined, not the truly fit, that survive the\nstruggle. Among these very submerged ones, reduced to dependence on an\nalien people, there are thousands who inherit the skill of their\nforefathers who fashioned their own locks, musical instruments, and\nguns. And these very women who are breaking their health and spirit over\na thankless tub of suds ought surely to turn their talents to better\naccount, ought to be designing and weaving coverlets and Roman-striped\nrugs, or 'piecing' the quilt patterns now so popular. Need these razors\nbe used to cut grindstones? Must this free folk who are in many ways the\ntruest Americans of America be brought under the yoke of caste division,\nto the degradation of all their finer qualities, merely for lack of the\nright work to do?\"\n\nThere are some who would have it so; who would calmly write for these\nour own kindred, as for the Indians, _fuerunt_--their day is past. In a\nHistory of Southern Literature, written not long ago by a professor in\nthe University of Virginia, a sketch of Miss Murfree's work closes with\nthese words: \"There [at Beersheba Springs, Tenn.] it was that she first\nstudied the curious type of humanity, the Tennessee mountaineer, a\npeople so ignorant, so superstitious, so far behind the world of to-day\nas to excite wonder and even pity in all who see them.... [She] is\ntelling the story of a people who, in these opening years of the 20th\ncentury, wander on through their limited range of life much as their\nancestors for generations have wandered. They, too, will some time\nvanish--the sooner the better.\"\n\nOne cannot read such a sentiment without wonder and even pity for the\nignorance of history and of human nature that it discloses. Is the case\nof our mountaineers so much worse than that of the Scotch highlanders of\ntwo centuries ago? We know that those Scotchmen did not \"vanish--the\nquicker the better.\" What were they before civilization reached them?\nLet us open the ready pages of Macaulay.--\n\n     \"It is not easy for a modern Englishman ... to believe that, in the\n     time of his great-grandfathers, Saint James's Street had as little\n     connection with the Grampians as with the Andes. Yet so it was. In\n     the south of our island scarcely anything was known about the\n     Celtic part of Scotland; and what was known excited no feeling but\n     contempt and loathing....\n\n     \"It is not strange that the Wild Scotch, as they were sometimes\n     called, should, in the 17th century, have been considered by the\n     Saxons as mere savages. But it is surely strange that, considered\n     as savages, they should not have been objects of interest and\n     curiosity. The English were then abundantly inquisitive about the\n     manners of rude nations separated from our island by great\n     continents and oceans. Numerous books were printed describing the\n     laws, the superstitions, the cabins, the repasts, the dresses, the\n     marriages, the funerals of Laplanders and Hottentots, Mohawks and\n     Malays. The plays and poems of that age are full of allusions to\n     the usages of the black men of Africa and the red men of America.\n     The only barbarian about whom there was no wish to have any\n     information was the Highlander....\n\n     \"While the old Gaelic institutions were in full vigor, no account\n     of them was given by any observer qualified to judge of them\n     fairly. Had such an observer studied the character of the\n     Highlanders, he would doubtless have found in it closely\n     intermingled the good and the bad qualities of an uncivilised\n     nation. He would have found that the people had no love for their\n     country or for their king, that they had no attachment to any\n     commonwealth larger than the clan, or to any magistrate superior to\n     the chief. He would have found that life was governed by a code of\n     morality and honor widely different from that which is established\n     in peaceful and prosperous societies. He would have learned that a\n     stab in the back, or a shot from behind a fragment of rock, were\n     approved modes of taking satisfaction for insults. He would have\n     heard men relate boastfully how they or their fathers had wracked\n     on hereditary enemies in a neighboring valley such vengeance as\n     would have made old soldiers of the Thirty Years' War shudder.\n\n     \"He would have found that robbery was held to be a calling not\n     merely innocent but honorable. He would have seen, wherever he\n     turned, that dislike of steady industry, and that disposition to\n     throw on the weaker sex the heaviest part of manual labor, which\n     are characteristic of savages. He would have been struck by the\n     spectacle of athletic men basking in the sun, angling for salmon,\n     or taking aim at grouse, while their aged mothers, their pregnant\n     wives, their tender daughters, were reaping the scanty harvest of\n     oats. Nor did the women repine at their hard lot. In their view it\n     was quite fit that a man, especially if he assumed the aristocratic\n     title of Duinhe Wassel and adorned his bonnet with the eagle's\n     feather, should take his ease, except when he was fighting,\n     hunting, or marauding. To mention the name of such a man in\n     connection with commerce or with any mechanical art was an insult.\n     Agriculture was indeed less despised. Yet a highborn warrior was\n     much more becomingly employed in plundering the land of others than\n     in tilling his own.\n\n     \"The religion of the greater part of the Highlands was a rude\n     mixture of Popery and Paganism. The symbol of redemption was\n     associated with heathen sacrifices and incantations. Baptised men\n     poured libations of ale on one D\u00c3\u00a6mon, and set out drink offerings\n     of milk for another. Seers wrapped themselves up in bulls' hides,\n     and awaited, in that vesture, the inspiration which was to reveal\n     the future. Even among those minstrels and genealogists whose\n     hereditary vocation was to preserve the memory of past events, an\n     enquirer would have found very few who could read. In truth, he\n     might easily have journeyed from sea to sea without discovering a\n     page of Gaelic printed or written.\n\n     \"The price which he would have had to pay for his knowledge of the\n     country would have been heavy. He would have had to endure\n     hardships as great as if he had sojourned among the Esquimaux or\n     the Samoyeds. Here and there, indeed, at the castle of some great\n     lord who had a seat in the Parliament and Privy Council, and who\n     was accustomed to pass a large part of his life in the cities of\n     the South, might have been found wigs and embroidered coats, plate\n     and fine linen, lace and jewels, French dishes and French wines.\n     But, in general, the traveler would have been forced to content\n     himself with very different quarters. In many dwellings the\n     furniture, the food, the clothing, nay, the very hair and skin of\n     his hosts, would have put his philosophy to the proof. His lodging\n     would sometimes have been in a hut of which every nook would have\n     swarmed with vermin. He would have inhaled an atmosphere thick with\n     peat smoke, and foul with a hundred exhalations. At supper grain\n     fit only for horses would have been set before him, accompanied\n     with a cake of blood drawn from living cows. Some of the company\n     with whom he would have feasted would have been covered with\n     cutaneous eruptions, and others would have been smeared with tar\n     like sheep. His couch would have been the bare earth, dry or wet as\n     the weather might be; and from that couch he would have risen half\n     poisoned with stench, half blind with the reek of turf, and half\n     mad with the itch.\n\n     \"This is not an attractive picture. And yet an enlightened and\n     dispassionate observer would have found in the character and\n     manners of this rude people something which might well excite\n     admiration and a good hope. Their courage was what great exploits\n     achieved in all the four quarters of the globe have since proved it\n     to be. Their intense attachment to their own tribe and to their own\n     patriarch, though politically a great evil, partook of the nature\n     of virtue. The sentiment was misdirected and ill regulated; but\n     still it was heroic. There must be some elevation of soul in a man\n     who loves the society of which he is a member and the leader whom\n     he follows with a love stronger than the love of life. It was true\n     that the Highlander had few scruples about shedding the blood of an\n     enemy; but it was not less true that he had high notions of the\n     duty of observing faith to allies and hospitality to guests. It was\n     true that his predatory habits were most pernicious to the\n     commonwealth. Yet those erred greatly who imagined that he bore any\n     resemblance to villains who, in rich and well governed communities,\n     live by stealing. When he drove before him the herds of Lowland\n     farmers up the pass which led to his native glen, he no more\n     considered himself as a thief than the Raleighs and Drakes\n     considered themselves as thieves when they divided the cargoes of\n     Spanish galleons. He was a warrior seizing lawful prize of war, of\n     war never once intermitted during the thirty-five generations which\n     had passed away since the Teutonic invaders had driven the children\n     of the soil to the mountains....\n\n     \"His inordinate pride of birth and his contempt for labor and trade\n     were indeed great weaknesses, and had done far more than the\n     inclemency of the air and the sterility of the soil to keep his\n     country poor and rude. Yet even here there was some compensation.\n     It must in fairness be acknowledged that the patrician virtues were\n     not less widely diffused among the population of the Highlands than\n     the patrician vices. As there was no other part of the island where\n     men, sordidly clothed, lodged, and fed, indulged themselves to such\n     a degree in the idle, sauntering habits of an aristocracy, so\n     there was no other part of the island where such men had in such a\n     degree the better qualities of an aristocracy, grace and dignity of\n     manner, self-respect, and that noble sensibility which makes\n     dishonor more terrible than death. A gentleman of Skye or Lochaber,\n     whose clothes were begrimed with the accumulated filth of years,\n     and whose hovel smelt worse than an English hogstye, would often do\n     the honors of that hovel with a lofty courtesy worthy of the\n     splendid circle of Versailles. Though he had as little\n     book-learning as the most stupid ploughboys of England, it would\n     have been a great error to put him in the same intellectual rank\n     with such ploughboys. It is indeed only by reading that men can\n     become profoundly acquainted with any science. But the arts of\n     poetry and rhetoric may be carried near to absolute perfection, and\n     may exercise a mighty influence on the public mind, in an age in\n     which books are wholly or almost wholly unknown.\"\n\n\nSo, too, in the rudest communities of Appalachia, among the most\ntrifling and unmoral natives of this region, among the illiterate and\nhide-bound, there still is much to excite admiration and good hope. I\nhave not shrunk from telling the truth about these people, even when it\nwas far from pleasant; but I would have preserved strict silence had I\nnot seen in the most backward of them certain sterling qualities of\nmanliness that our nation can ill afford to waste. It is a truth as old\nas the human race that savageries may co-exist with admirable qualities\nof head and heart. The only people who can consistently despair of the\nfuture for even the lowest of our mountaineers are those who deny\nevolution and who believe, with Archbishop Usher, that man was created\n_perfect_ at 9 A. M. on the 21st of October, in the year B. C. 4004.\n\nLet us remember, Sir and Madam, that we ourselves are descended from\nwhite barbarians. From William the Conqueror, you? Very well; how many\nother ancestors of yours were walking about England and elsewhere at the\ntime of William? Untold thousands of them were just such people as you\ncan find to-day brawling in some mountain still-house (unless there has\nbeen a deal of incest somewhere along your line), and you have\ninfinitely more of their blood in your veins than you have of the\nConqueror's--who, by the way, could he be re-incarnated, would not be\ntolerated in your drawing-room for half an hour. I may have made the\npoint too brutally plain; but if it sinks through the smug\nself-complacency of those who \"do not belong to the masses,\" who act as\nthough civilization and morals and good manners were entailed to them\nthrough a mere dozen or so of selected ancestors, I remain unrepentant\nand unashamed. Let us thank whatever gods there be that it is not\nmerely thou and I, our few friends and next of kin, but all humanity,\nthat scientific faith embraces and will sustain.\n\n\"People who have been among the southern mountaineers testify,\" says Mr.\nFox, \"that, as a race, they are proud, sensitive, hospitable, kindly,\nobliging in an unreckoning way that is almost pathetic, honest, loyal,\nin spite of their common ignorance, poverty, and isolation; that they\nare naturally capable, eager to learn, easy to uplift. Americans to the\ncore, they make the southern mountains a storehouse of patriotism; in\nthemselves they are an important offset to the Old World outcasts whom\nwe have welcomed to our shores; and they surely deserve as much\nconsideration from the nation as the negroes, or as the heathen, to whom\nwe give millions.\"\n\nPresident Frost, of Berea College, who has worked among these people for\nnearly a lifetime, and has helped to educate their young folks by\nthousands, says: \"It does one's heart good to help a young Lincoln who\ncomes walking in perhaps a three-days' journey on foot, with a few\nhard-earned dollars in his pocket and a great eagerness for the\neducation he can so faintly comprehend. (Scores of our young people see\ntheir first railroad train at Berea.) And it is a joy to welcome the\nmountain girl who comes back after having taught her first school,\nbringing the money to pay her debts and buy her first comfortable\noutfit--including rubbers and suitable underclothing--and perhaps\nbringing with her a younger sister. Such a girl exerts a great influence\nin her school and mountain home. An enthusiastic mountaineer described\nan example in this wise: 'I tell yeou hit teks a moughty resol_ute_ gal\nter do what that thar gal has done. She got, I reckon, about the\ntoughest deestric' in the ceounty, which is sayin' a good deal. An' then\nfer boardin'-place--well, there warn't much choice. There was one house,\nwith one room. But she kep right on, an' yeou would hev thought she was\nhavin' the finest kind of a time, ter look at her. An' then the last\nday, when they was sayin' their pieces and sich, some sorry fellers come\nin thar full o' moonshine an' shot their revolvers. I'm a-tellin' ye hit\ntakes a moughty resol_ute_ gal.\"\n\nThe great need of our mountaineers to-day is trained leaders of their\nown. The future of Appalachia lies mostly in the hands of those resolute\nnative boys and girls who win the education fitting them for such\nleadership. Here is where the nation at large is summoned by a solemn\nduty. And it should act quickly, because commercialism exploits and\ndebauches quickly. But the schools needed here are not ordinary graded\nschools. They should be vocational schools that will turn out good\nfarmers, good mechanics, good housewives. Meantime let a model farm be\nestablished in every mountain county showing how to get the most out of\nmountain land. Such object lessons would speedily work an economic\nrevolution. It is an economic problem, fundamentally, that the\nmountaineer has to face.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes:\n\n[1] A friend of mine on the U. S.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1443,"split":"test"}
