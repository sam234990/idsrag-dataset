He marries the pretty and cosseted Rosalie Vanderpoel, the daughter of an American millionaire. But on their return to England, Nigel and his mother control and isolate Rosalie from her family. Many years later, Rosalie's now-grown up sister Bettina, who has spent a decade wondering why Rosy has lost contact with the family, arrives at Stornham Court to investigate. She discovers Rosalie and her son Ughtred, physically and emotionally fragile, living in the ruined estate. Bettina, who is both beautiful and made of considerably stronger stuff than her sister, begins to restore both Rosalie's health and spirits and the building and grounds of Stornham Court in Nigel's absence. Bettina, as an attractive heiress, attracts the attention of the local gentry and re-integrates her sister into society, while also gaining the respect of the villagers by her insistence that repairs be done by local workers.\nBettina also makes the acquaintance of another impoverished English nobleman, Lord Mount Dunstan, who has considerably more pride and spirit than Sir Nigel and has no intention of marrying an American heiress to restore his estate, but who is not well-respected in the neighbourhood due to his disreputable late father and brother. Mount Dunstan regains the respect of the neighbourhood due to a chance encounter with an American typewriter salesman on holiday, G. Seldon, and because he opens his estate to workers afflicted by typhoid fever. When Sir Nigel returns home to discover Rosalie and Ughtred in improved health and spirits, the estate nearly restored, and Betty responsible for it all, he tries to conceal his ill-will but has never been particularly good at self-control. In a final confrontation, Nigel attempts to bully Bettina into leaving Rosalie at Stornham Court, this time with more of her father's money, but she hides from him and eventually returns with Mount Dunstan, who she had believed dead of typhus. Mount Dunstan whips Sir Nigel \"like a dog,\" and the latter eventually suffers a fit and dies, while Bettina and Mount Dunstan overcome their pride and confess their love for each other.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Shuttle, by Frances Hodgson Burnett\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Fate\nalone saw the meaning of the web it wove, the might of it, and its place\nin the making of a world's history. Men thought but little of either web\nor weaving, calling them by other names and lighter ones, for the time\nunconscious of the strength of the thread thrown across thousands of\nmiles of leaping, heaving, grey or blue ocean.\n\nFate and Life planned the weaving, and it seemed mere circumstance\nwhich guided the Shuttle to and fro between two worlds divided by a gulf\nbroader and deeper than the thousands of miles of salt, fierce sea--the\ngulf of a bitter quarrel deepened by hatred and the shedding of\nbrothers' blood. Between the two worlds of East and West there was no\nwill to draw nearer. Each held apart. Those who had rebelled against\nthat which their souls called tyranny, having struggled madly and\nshed blood in tearing themselves free, turned stern backs upon their\nunconquered enemies, broke all cords that bound them to the past,\nflinging off ties of name, kinship and rank, beginning with fierce\ndisdain a new life.\n\nThose who, being rebelled against, found the rebels too passionate\nin their determination and too desperate in their defence of their\nstrongholds to be less than unconquerable, sailed back haughtily to the\nworld which seemed so far the greater power. Plunging into new battles,\nthey added new conquests and splendour to their land, looking back with\nsomething of contempt to the half-savage West left to build its own\ncivilisation without other aid than the strength of its own strong right\nhand and strong uncultured brain.\n\nBut while the two worlds held apart, the Shuttle, weaving slowly in the\ngreat hand of Fate, drew them closer and held them firm, each of them\nall unknowing for many a year, that what had at first been mere threads\nof gossamer, was forming a web whose strength in time none could\ncompute, whose severance could be accomplished but by tragedy and\nconvulsion.\n\nThe weaving was but in its early and slow-moving years when this\nstory opens. Steamers crossed and recrossed the Atlantic, but they\naccomplished the journey at leisure and with heavy rollings and all such\ndiscomforts as small craft can afford. Their staterooms and decks were\nnot crowded with people to whom the voyage was a mere incident--in many\ncases a yearly one. \"A crossing\" in those days was an event. It was\nplanned seriously, long thought of, discussed and re-discussed, with and\namong the various members of the family to which the voyager belonged.\nA certain boldness, bordering on recklessness, was almost to be\npresupposed in the individual who, turning his back upon New York,\nPhiladelphia, Boston, and like cities, turned his face towards \"Europe.\"\nIn those days when the Shuttle wove at leisure, a man did not lightly\nrun over to London, or Paris, or Berlin, he gravely went to \"Europe.\"\n\nThe journey being likely to be made once in a lifetime, the traveller's\nintention was to see as much as possible, to visit as many cities\ncathedrals, ruins, galleries, as his time and purse would allow. People\nwho could speak with any degree of familiarity of Hyde Park, the Champs\nElysees, the Pincio, had gained a certain dignity. The ability to touch\nwith an intimate bearing upon such localities was a raison de plus for\nbeing asked out to tea or to dinner. To possess photographs and relics\nwas to be of interest, to have seen European celebrities even at a\ndistance, to have wandered about the outside of poets' gardens and\nphilosophers' houses, was to be entitled to respect. The period was a\nfar cry from the time when the Shuttle, having shot to and fro, faster\nand faster, week by week, month by month, weaving new threads into its\nweb each year, has woven warp and woof until they bind far shore to\nshore.\n\nIt was in comparatively early days that the first thread we follow\nwas woven into the web. Many such have been woven since and have\nadded greater strength than any others, twining the cord of sex and\nhome-building and race-founding. But this was a slight and weak\none, being only the thread of the life of one of Reuben Vanderpoel's\ndaughters--the pretty little simple one whose name was Rosalie.\n\nThey were--the Vanderpoels--of the Americans whose fortunes were a\nportion of the history of their country. The building of these fortunes\nhad been a part of, or had created epochs and crises. Their millions\ncould scarcely be regarded as private property. Newspapers bandied them\nabout, so to speak, employing them as factors in argument, using them\nas figures of speech, incorporating them into methods of calculation.\nLiterature touched upon them, moral systems considered them, stories for\nthe young treated them gravely as illustrative.\n\nThe first Reuben Vanderpoel, who in early days of danger had traded with\nsavages for the pelts of wild animals, was the lauded hero of stories\nof thrift and enterprise. Throughout his hard-working life he had been\nirresistibly impelled to action by an absolute genius of commerce,\nexpressing itself at the outset by the exhibition of courage in mere\nexchange and barter. An alert power to perceive the potential value of\nthings and the possible malleability of men and circumstances, had stood\nhim in marvellous good stead. He had bought at low prices things which\nin the eyes of the less discerning were worthless, but, having obtained\npossession of such things, the less discerning had almost invariably\nawakened to the fact that, in his hands, values increased, and methods\nof remunerative disposition, being sought, were found. Nothing remained\nunutilisable. The practical, sordid, uneducated little man developed the\npower to create demand for his own supplies. If he was betrayed into\nan error, he quickly retrieved it. He could live upon nothing and\nconsequently could travel anywhere in search of such things as he\ndesired. He could barely read and write, and could not spell, but he was\ndaring and astute. His untaught brain was that of a financier, his blood\nburned with the fever of but one desire--the desire to accumulate. Money\nexpressed to his nature, not expenditure, but investment in such small\nor large properties as could be resold at profit in the near or far\nfuture. The future held fascinations for him. He bought nothing for his\nown pleasure or comfort, nothing which could not be sold or bartered\nagain. He married a woman who was a trader's daughter and shared his\npassion for gain. She was of North of England blood, her father having\nbeen a hard-fisted small tradesman in an unimportant town, who had been\ndaring enough to emigrate when emigration meant the facing of unknown\ndangers in a half-savage land. She had excited Reuben Vanderpoel's\nadmiration by taking off her petticoat one bitter winter's day to sell\nit to a squaw in exchange for an ornament for which she chanced to know\nanother squaw would pay with a skin of value. The first Mrs. Vanderpoel\nwas as wonderful as her husband. They were both wonderful. They were\nthe founders of the fortune which a century and a half later was the\ndelight--in fact the piece de resistance--of New York society reporters,\nits enormity being restated in round figures when a blank space must be\nfilled up. The method of statement lent itself to infinite variety and\nwas always interesting to a particular class, some elements of which\nfelt it encouraging to be assured that so much money could be a personal\npossession, some elements feeling the fact an additional argument to be\nused against the infamy of monopoly.\n\nThe first Reuben Vanderpoel transmitted to his son his accumulations and\nhis fever for gain. He had but one child. The second Reuben built upon\nthe foundations this afforded him, a fortune as much larger than the\nfirst as the rapid growth and increasing capabilities of the country\ngave him enlarging opportunities to acquire. It was no longer necessary\nto deal with savages: his powers were called upon to cope with those\nof white men who came to a new country to struggle for livelihood and\nfortune. Some were shrewd, some were desperate, some were dishonest. But\nshrewdness never outwitted, desperation never overcame, dishonesty never\ndeceived the second Reuben Vanderpoel. Each characteristic ended by\nadapting itself to his own purposes and qualities, and as a result of\neach it was he who in any business transaction was the gainer. It was\nthe common saying that the Vanderpoels were possessed of a money-making\nspell. Their spell lay in their entire mental and physical absorption in\none idea. Their peculiarity was not so much that they wished to be rich\nas that Nature itself impelled them to collect wealth as the load-stone\ndraws towards it iron. Having possessed nothing, they became rich,\nhaving become rich they became richer, having founded their fortunes\non small schemes, they increased them by enormous ones. In time they\nattained that omnipotence of wealth which it would seem no circumstance\ncan control or limit. The first Reuben Vanderpoel could not spell, the\nsecond could, the third was as well educated as a man could be whose\nsole profession is money-making. His children were taught all that\nexpensive teachers and expensive opportunities could teach them. After\nthe second generation the meagre and mercantile physical type of the\nVanderpoels improved upon itself. Feminine good looks appeared and were\nmade the most of. The Vanderpoel element invested even good looks to an\nadvantage. The fourth Reuben Vanderpoel had no son and two daughters.\nThey were brought up in a brown-stone mansion built upon a fashionable\nNew York thoroughfare roaring with traffic. To the farthest point of\nthe Rocky Mountains the number of dollars this \"mansion\" (it was always\ncalled so) had cost, was known. There may have existed Pueblo Indians\nwho had heard rumours of the price of it. All the shop-keepers and\nfarmers in the United States had read newspaper descriptions of its\nfurnishings and knew the value of the brocade which hung in the bedrooms\nand boudoirs of the Misses Vanderpoel. It was a fact much cherished that\nMiss Rosalie's bath was of Carrara marble, and to good souls actively\nengaged in doing their own washing in small New England or Western\ntowns, it was a distinct luxury to be aware that the water in the\nCarrara marble bath was perfumed with Florentine Iris. Circumstances\nsuch as these seemed to become personal possessions and even to lighten\nsomewhat the burden of toil.\n\nRosalie Vanderpoel married an Englishman of title, and part of the\nstory of her married life forms my prologue. Hers was of the early\ninternational marriages, and the republican mind had not yet adjusted\nitself to all that such alliances might imply. It was yet ingenuous,\nimaginative and confiding in such matters. A baronetcy and a manor house\nreigning over an old English village and over villagers in possible\nsmock frocks, presented elements of picturesque dignity to people whose\nintimacy with such allurements had been limited by the novels of Mrs.\nOliphant and other writers. The most ordinary little anecdotes in which\nvicarages, gamekeepers, and dowagers figured, were exciting in these\nearly days. \"Sir Nigel Anstruthers,\" when engraved upon a visiting card,\nwore an air of distinction almost startling. Sir Nigel himself was\nnot as picturesque as his name, though he was not entirely without\nattraction, when for reasons of his own he chose to aim at agreeableness\nof bearing. He was a man with a good figure and a good voice, and but\nfor a heaviness of feature the result of objectionable living, might\nhave given the impression of being better looking than he really was.\nNew York laid amused and at the same time, charmed stress upon the fact\nthat he spoke with an \"English accent.\" His enunciation was in fact\nclear cut and treated its vowels well. He was a man who observed with an\nair of accustomed punctiliousness such social rules and courtesies as he\ndeemed it expedient to consider. An astute worldling had remarked that\nhe was at once more ceremonious and more casual in his manner than men\nbred in America.\n\n\"If you invite him to dinner,\" the wording said, \"or if you die,\nor marry, or meet with an accident, his notes of condolence or\ncongratulation are prompt and civil, but the actual truth is that he\ncares nothing whatever about you or your relations, and if you don't\nplease him he does not hesitate to sulk or be astonishingly rude, which\nlast an American does not allow himself to be, as a rule.\"\n\nBy many people Sir Nigel was not analysed, but accepted. He was of the\nearly English who came to New York, and was a novelty of interest, with\nhis background of Manor House and village and old family name. He was\nvery much talked of at vivacious ladies' luncheon parties, he was very\nmuch talked to at equally vivacious afternoon teas. At dinner parties he\nwas furtively watched a good deal, but after dinner when he sat with\nthe men over their wine, he was not popular. He was not perhaps exactly\ndisliked, but men whose chief interest at that period lay in stocks\nand railroads, did not find conversation easy with a man whose sole\noccupation had been the shooting of birds and the hunting of foxes,\nwhen he was not absolutely loitering about London, with his time on his\nhands. The stories he told--and they were few--were chiefly anecdotes\nwhose points gained their humour by the fact that a man was a comically\nbad shot or bad rider and either peppered a gamekeeper or was thrown\ninto a ditch when his horse went over a hedge, and such relations\ndid not increase in the poignancy of their interest by being filtered\nthrough brains accustomed to applying their powers to problems of\nspeculation and commerce. He was not so dull but that he perceived\nthis at an early stage of his visit to New York, which was probably the\nreason of the infrequency of his stories.\n\nHe on his side was naturally not quick to rise to the humour of a \"big\ndeal\" or a big blunder made on Wall Street--or to the wit of jokes\nconcerning them. Upon the whole he would have been glad to have\nunderstood such matters more clearly. His circumstances were such as\nhad at last forced him to contemplate the world of money-makers with\nsomething of an annoyed respect. \"These fellows\" who had neither\ntitles nor estates to keep up could make money. He, as he acknowledged\ndisgustedly to himself, was much worse than a beggar. There was Stornham\nCourt in a state of ruin--the estate going to the dogs, the farmhouses\ntumbling to pieces and he, so to speak, without a sixpence to bless\nhimself with, and head over heels in debt. Englishmen of the rank which\nin bygone times had not associated itself with trade had begun at least\nto trifle with it--to consider its potentialities as factors possibly\nto be made useful by the aristocracy. Countesses had not yet spiritedly\nopened milliners' shops, nor belted Earls adorned the stage, but certain\nnoblemen had dallied with beer and coquetted with stocks. One of\nthe first commercial developments had been the discovery of\nAmerica--particularly of New York--as a place where if one could make up\none's mind to the plunge, one might marry one's sons profitably. At\nthe outset it presented a field so promising as to lead to rashness and\nindiscretion on the part of persons not given to analysis of character\nand in consequence relying too serenely upon an ingenuousness which\nrather speedily revealed that it had its limits. Ingenuousness combining\nitself with remarkable alertness of perception on occasion, is\nrather American than English, and is, therefore, to the English mind,\nmisleading.\n\nAt first younger sons, who \"gave trouble\" to their families, were sent\nout. Their names, their backgrounds of castles or manors, relatives of\ndistinction, London seasons, fox hunting, Buckingham Palace and Goodwood\nRaces, formed a picturesque allurement. That the castles and manors\nwould belong to their elder brothers, that the relatives of distinction\ndid not encourage intimacy with swarms of the younger branches of their\nfamilies; that London seasons, hunting, and racing were for their elders\nand betters, were facts not realised in all their importance by the\nrepublican mind. In the course of time they were realised to the full,\nbut in Rosalie Vanderpoel's nineteenth year they covered what was at\nthat time almost unknown territory. One may rest assured Sir Nigel\nAnstruthers said nothing whatsoever in New York of an interview he had\nhad before sailing with an intensely disagreeable great-aunt, who was\nthe wife of a Bishop. She was a horrible old woman with a broad face,\nblunt features and a raucous voice, whose tones added acridity to\nher observations when she was indulging in her favourite pastime of\ninterfering with the business of her acquaintances and relations.\n\n\"I do not know what you are going chasing off to America for, Nigel,\"\nshe commented. \"You can't afford it and it is perfectly ridiculous of\nyou to take it upon yourself to travel for pleasure as if you were a man\nof means instead of being in such a state of pocket that Maria tells me\nyou cannot pay your tailor. Neither the Bishop nor I can do anything\nfor you and I hope you don't expect it. All I can hope is that you know\nyourself what you are going to America in search of, and that it is\nsomething more practical than buffaloes. You had better stop in New\nYork. Those big shopkeepers' daughters are enormously rich, they say,\nand they are immensely pleased by attentions from men of your class.\nThey say they'll marry anything if it has an aunt or a grandmother with\na title. You can mention the Marchioness, you know. You need not refer\nto the fact that she thought your father a blackguard and your mother an\ninterloper, and that you have never been invited to Broadmere since you\nwere born. You can refer casually to me and to the Bishop and to the\nPalace, too. A Palace--even a Bishop's--ought to go a long way with\nAmericans. They will think it is something royal.\" She ended her remarks\nwith one of her most insulting snorts of laughter, and Sir Nigel became\ndark red and looked as if he would like to knock her down.\n\nIt was not, however, her sentiments which were particularly revolting to\nhim. If she had expressed them in a manner more flattering to himself he\nwould have felt that there was a good deal to be said for them. In\nfact, he had put the same thing to himself some time previously, and, in\nsumming up the American matter, had reached certain thrifty decisions.\nThe impulse to knock her down surged within him solely because he had a\nbrutally bad temper when his vanity was insulted, and he was furious at\nher impudence in speaking to him as if he were a villager out of work\nwhom she was at liberty to bully and lecture.\n\n\"For a woman who is supposed to have been born of gentle people,\" he\nsaid to his mother afterwards, \"Aunt Marian is the most vulgar old beast\nI have ever beheld. She has the taste of a female costermonger.\" Which\nwas entirely true, but it might be added that his own was no better and\nhis points of view and morals wholly coincided with his taste.\n\nNaturally Rosalie Vanderpoel knew nothing of this side of the matter.\nShe had been a petted, butterfly child, who had been pretty and admired\nand indulged from her infancy; she had grown up into a petted, butterfly\ngirl, pretty and admired and surrounded by inordinate luxury. Her world\nhad been made up of good-natured, lavish friends and relations, who\nenjoyed themselves and felt a delight in her girlish toilettes and\ntriumphs. She had spent her one season of belledom in being whirled from\nfestivity to festivity, in dancing in rooms festooned with thousands of\ndollars' worth of flowers, in lunching or dining at tables loaded with\nroses and violets and orchids, from which ballrooms or feasts she had\nborne away wonderful \"favours\" and gifts, whose prices, being recorded\nin the newspapers, caused a thrill of delight or envy to pass over the\nland. She was a slim little creature, with quantities of light feathery\nhair like a French doll's. She had small hands and small feet and a\nsmall waist--a small brain also, it must be admitted, but she was an\ninnocent, sweet-tempered girl with a childlike simpleness of mind.\nIn fine, she was exactly the girl to find Sir Nigel's domineering\ntemperament at once imposing and attractive, so long as it was cloaked\nby the ceremonies of external good breeding.\n\nHer sister Bettina, who was still a child, was of a stronger and less\nsusceptible nature. Betty--at eight--had long legs and a square but\ndelicate small face. Her well-opened steel-blue eyes were noticeable\nfor rather extravagant ink-black lashes and a straight young stare\nwhich seemed to accuse if not to condemn. She was being educated at\na ruinously expensive school with a number of other inordinately rich\nlittle girls, who were all too wonderfully dressed and too lavishly\nsupplied with pocket money. The school considered itself especially\nrefined and select, but was in fact interestingly vulgar.\n\nThe inordinately rich little girls, who had most of them pretty and\nspiritual or pretty and piquant faces, ate a great many bon bons and\nchattered a great deal in high unmodulated voices about the parties\ntheir sisters and other relatives went to and the dresses they wore.\nSome of them were nice little souls, who in the future would emerge from\ntheir chrysalis state enchanting women, but they used colloquialisms\nfreely, and had an ingenuous habit of referring to the prices of\nthings. Bettina Vanderpoel, who was the richest and cleverest and most\npromisingly handsome among them, was colloquial to slanginess, but she\nhad a deep, mellow, child voice and an amazing carriage.\n\nShe could not endure Sir Nigel Anstruthers, and, being an American\nchild, did not hesitate to express herself with force, if with some\ncrudeness. \"He's a hateful thing,\" she said, \"I loathe him. He's stuck\nup and he thinks you are afraid of him and he likes it.\"\n\nSir Nigel had known only English children, little girls who lived in\nthat discreet corner of their parents' town or country houses known\nas \"the schoolroom,\" apparently emerging only for daily walks with\ngovernesses; girls with long hair and boys in little high hats and with\nfaces which seemed curiously made to match them. Both boys and girls\nwere decently kept out of the way and not in the least dwelt on except\nwhen brought out for inspection during the holidays and taken to the\npantomime.\n\nSir Nigel had not realised that an American child was an absolute factor\nto be counted with, and a \"youngster\" who entered the drawing-room when\nshe chose and joined fearlessly in adult conversation was an element he\nconsidered annoying. It was quite true that Bettina talked too much\nand too readily at times, but it had not been explained to her that\nthe opinions of eight years are not always of absorbing interest to the\nmature. It was also true that Sir Nigel was a great fool for interfering\nwith what was clearly no affair of his in such a manner as would have\nmade him an enemy even had not the child's instinct arrayed her against\nhim at the outset.\n\n\"You American youngsters are too cheeky,\" he said on one of the\noccasions when Betty had talked too much. \"If you were my sister and\nlived at Stornham Court, you would be learning lessons in the schoolroom\nand wearing a pinafore. Nobody ever saw my sister Emily when she was\nyour age.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm not your sister Emily,\" retorted Betty, \"and I guess I'm glad\nof it.\"\n\nIt was rather impudent of her, but it must be confessed that she was\nnot infrequently rather impudent in a rude little-girl way, but she was\nserenely unconscious of the fact.\n\nSir Nigel flushed darkly and laughed a short, unpleasant laugh. If she\nhad been his sister Emily she would have fared ill at the moment, for\nhis villainous temper would have got the better of him.\n\n\"I 'guess' that I may be congratulated too,\" he sneered.\n\n\"If I was going to be anybody's sister Emily,\" said Betty, excited a\nlittle by the sense of the fray, \"I shouldn't want to be yours.\"\n\n\"Now Betty, don't be hateful,\" interposed Rosalie, laughing, and her\nlaugh was nervous. \"There's Mina Thalberg coming up the front steps. Go\nand meet her.\"\n\nRosalie, poor girl, always found herself nervous when Sir Nigel and\nBetty were in the room together. She instinctively recognised their\nantagonism and was afraid Betty would do something an English baronet\nwould think vulgar. Her simple brain could not have explained to her\nwhy it was that she knew Sir Nigel often thought New Yorkers vulgar. She\nwas, however, quite aware of this but imperfectly concealed fact, and\nfelt a timid desire to be explanatory.\n\nWhen Bettina marched out of the room with her extraordinary carriage\nfinely manifest, Rosy's little laugh was propitiatory.\n\n\"You mustn't mind her,\" she said. \"She's a real splendid little thing,\nbut she's got a quick temper. It's all over in a minute.\"\n\n\"They wouldn't stand that sort of thing in England,\" said Sir Nigel.\n\"She's deucedly spoiled, you know.\"\n\nHe detested the child. He disliked all children, but this one awakened\nin him more than mere dislike. The fact was that though Betty herself\nwas wholly unconscious of the subtle truth, the as yet undeveloped\nintellect which later made her a brilliant and captivating personality,\nvaguely saw him as he was, an unscrupulous, sordid brute, as remorseless\nan adventurer and swindler in his special line, as if he had been\nengaged in drawing false cheques and arranging huge jewel robberies,\ninstead of planning to entrap into a disadvantageous marriage a girl\nwhose gentleness and fortune could be used by a blackguard of reputable\nname. The man was cold-blooded enough to see that her gentle weakness\nwas of value because it could be bullied, her money was to be counted on\nbecause it could be spent on himself and his degenerate vices and on his\nracked and ruined name and estate, which must be rebuilt and restocked\nat an early date by someone or other, lest they tumbled into ignominious\ncollapse which could not be concealed. Bettina of the accusing eyes did\nnot know that in the depth of her yet crude young being, instinct was\nsumming up for her the potentialities of an unusually fine specimen of\nthe British blackguard, but this was nevertheless the interesting truth.\nWhen later she was told that her sister had become engaged to Sir\nNigel Anstruthers, a flame of colour flashed over her face, she stared\nsilently a moment, then bit her lip and burst into tears.\n\n\"Well, Bett,\" exclaimed Rosalie, \"you are the queerest thing I ever\nsaw.\"\n\nBettina's tears were an outburst, not a flow. She swept them away\npassionately with her small handkerchief.\n\n\"He'll do something awful to you,\" she said. \"He'll nearly kill you. I\nknow he will. I'd rather be dead myself.\"\n\nShe dashed out of the room, and could never be induced to say a word\nfurther about the matter. She would indeed have found it impossible to\nexpress her intense antipathy and sense of impending calamity. She had\nnot the phrases to make herself clear even to herself, and after all\nwhat controlling effort can one produce when one is only eight years\nold?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nA LACK OF PERCEPTION\n\nMercantile as Americans were proclaimed to be, the opinion of Sir\nNigel Anstruthers was that they were, on some points, singularly\nunbusinesslike. In the perfectly obvious and simple matter of the\nsettlement of his daughter's fortune, he had felt that Reuben Vanderpoel\nwas obtuse to the point of idiocy. He seemed to have none of the\nordinary points of view. Naturally there was to Anstruthers' mind but\none point of view to take. A man of birth and rank, he argued, does not\ncareer across the Atlantic to marry a New York millionaire's daughter\nunless he anticipates deriving some advantage from the alliance. Such\na man--being of Anstruthers' type--would not have married a rich woman\neven in his own country with out making sure that advantages were to\naccrue to himself as a result of the union. \"In England,\" to use his\nown words, \"there was no nonsense about it.\" Women's fortunes as well as\nthemselves belonged to their husbands, and a man who was master in his\nown house could make his wife do as he chose. He had seen girls with\nmoney managed very satisfactorily by fellows who held a tight rein, and\nwere not moved by tears, and did not allow talking to relations. If\nhe had been desirous of marrying and could have afforded to take a\npenniless wife, there were hundreds of portionless girls ready to thank\nGod for a decent chance to settle themselves for life, and one need not\nstir out of one's native land to find them.\n\nBut Sir Nigel had not in the least desired to saddle himself with a\ndomestic encumbrance, in fact nothing would have induced him to consider\nthe step if he had not been driven hard by circumstances. His fortunes\nhad reached a stage where money must be forthcoming somehow--from\nsomewhere. He and his mother had been living from hand to mouth, so to\nspeak, for years, and they had also been obliged to keep up appearances,\nwhich is sometimes embittering even to persons of amiable tempers. Lady\nAnstruthers, it is true, had lived in the country in as niggardly\na manner as possible. She had narrowed her existence to absolute\nprivation, presenting at the same time a stern, bold front to the\npersons who saw her, to the insufficient staff of servants, to the\nvillage to the vicar and his wife, and the few far-distant neighbours\nwho perhaps once a year drove miles to call or leave a card. She was an\nold woman sufficiently unattractive to find no difficulty in the way\nof limiting her acquaintances. The unprepossessing wardrobe she had\ngathered in the passing years was remade again and again by the village\ndressmaker. She wore dingy old silk gowns and appalling bonnets, and\nmantles dripping with rusty fringes and bugle beads, but these mitigated\nnot in the least the unflinching arrogance of her bearing, or the\nsimple, intolerant rudeness which she considered proper and becoming\nin persons like herself. She did not of course allow that there existed\nmany persons like herself.\n\nThat society rejoiced in this fact was but the stamp of its inferiority\nand folly. While she pinched herself and harried her few hirelings at\nStornham it was necessary for Sir Nigel to show himself in town and\npresent as decent an appearance as possible. His vanity was far too\narrogant to allow of his permitting himself to drop out of the world to\nwhich he could not afford to belong. That he should have been forgotten\nor ignored would have been intolerable to him. For a few years he was\ninvited to dine at good houses, and got shooting and hunting as part\nof the hospitality of his acquaintances. But a man who cannot afford to\nreturn hospitalities will find that he need not expect to avail himself\nof those of his acquaintances to the end of his career unless he is an\nextremely engaging person. Sir Nigel Anstruthers was not an engaging\nperson. He never gave a thought to the comfort or interest of any other\nhuman being than himself. He was also dominated by the kind of nasty\ntemper which so reveals itself when let loose that its owner cannot\ncontrol it even when it would be distinctly to his advantage to do so.\n\nFinding that he had nothing to give in return for what he took as if it\nwere his right, society gradually began to cease to retain any lively\nrecollection of his existence. The tradespeople he had borne himself\nloftily towards awakened to the fact that he was the kind of man it was\nat once safe and wise to dun, and therefore proceeded to make his life\na burden to him. At his clubs he had never been a member surrounded and\nrejoiced over when he made his appearance. The time came when he began\nto fancy that he was rather edged away from, and he endeavoured to\nsustain his dignity by being sulky and making caustic speeches when he\nwas approached. Driven occasionally down to Stornham by actual pressure\nof circumstances, he found the outlook there more embittering still.\n\nLady Anstruthers laid the bareness of the land before him without any\neffort to palliate unpleasantness. If he chose to stalk about and look\nglum, she could sit still and call his attention to revolting truths\nwhich he could not deny. She could point out to him that he had no\nmoney, and that tenants would not stay in houses which were tumbling to\npieces, and work land which had been starved. She could tell him just\nhow long a time had elapsed since wages had been paid and accounts\ncleared off. And she had an engaging, unbiassed way of seeming to drive\nthese maddening details home by the mere manner of her statement.\n\n\"You make the whole thing as damned disagreeable as you can,\" Nigel\nwould snarl.\n\n\"I merely state facts,\" she would reply with acrid serenity.\n\nA man who cannot keep up his estate, pay his tailor or the rent of his\nlodgings in town, is in a strait which may drive him to desperation.\nSir Nigel Anstruthers borrowed some money, went to New York and made his\nsuit to nice little silly Rosalie Vanderpoel.\n\nBut the whole thing was unexpectedly disappointing and surrounded by\nirritating circumstances. He found himself face to face with a state of\naffairs such as he had not contemplated. In England when a man married,\ncertain practical matters could be inquired into and arranged by\nsolicitors, the amount of the prospective bride's fortune, the\nallowances and settlements to be made, the position of the bridegroom\nwith regard to pecuniary matters. To put it simply, a man found out\nwhere he stood and what he was to gain. But, at first to his sardonic\nentertainment and later to his disgusted annoyance, Sir Nigel gradually\ndiscovered that in the matter of marriage, Americans had an ingenuous\ntendency to believe in the sentimental feelings of the parties\nconcerned. The general impression seemed to be that a man married purely\nfor love, and that delicacy would make it impossible for him to ask\nquestions as to what his bride's parents were in a position to hand\nover to him as a sort of indemnity for the loss of his bachelor freedom.\nAnstruthers began to discover this fact before he had been many weeks\nin New York. He reached the realisation of its existence by processes of\nexclusion and inclusion, by hearing casual remarks people let drop, by\nasking roundabout and careful questions, by leading both men and women\nto the innocent expounding of certain points of view. Millionaires, it\nappeared, did not expect to make allowances to men who married their\ndaughters; young women, it transpired, did not in the least realise that\na man should be liberally endowed in payment for assuming the duties\nof a husband. If rich fathers made allowances, they made them to their\ndaughters themselves, who disposed of them as they pleased. In this\ncase, of course, Sir Nigel privately argued with fine acumen, it became\nthe husband's business to see that what his wife pleased should be what\nmost agreeably coincided with his own views and conveniences.\n\nHis most illuminating experience had been the hearing of some men,\nhard-headed, rich stockbrokers with a vulgar sense of humour, enjoying\nthemselves quite uproariously one night at a club, over a story one\nof them was relating of an unsatisfactory German son-in-law who had\ndemanded an income. He was a man of small title, who had married the\nnarrator's daughter, and after some months spent in his father-in-law's\nhouse, had felt it but proper that his financial position should be put\non a practical footing.\n\n\"He brought her back after the bridal tour to make us a visit,\" said the\nstoryteller, a sharp-featured man with a quaint wry mouth, which seemed\nto express a perpetual, repressed appreciation of passing events. \"I had\nnothing to say against that, because we were all glad to see her home\nand her mother had been missing her. But weeks passed and months passed\nand there was no mention made of them going over to settle in the\nSlosh we'd heard so much of, and in time it came out that the Slosh\nthing\"--Anstruthers realised with gall in his soul that the \"brute,\"\nas he called him, meant \"Schloss,\" and that his mispronunciation was\nat once a matter of humour and derision--\"wasn't his at all. It was his\nelder brother's. The whole lot of them were counts and not one of them\nseemed to own a dime. The Slosh count hadn't more than twenty-five cents\nand he wasn't the kind to deal any of it out to his family. So Lily's\ncount would have to go clerking in a dry goods store, if he promised to\nsupport himself. But he didn't propose to do it. He thought he'd got on\nto a soft thing. Of course we're an easy-going lot and we should have\nstood him if he'd been a nice fellow. But he wasn't. Lily's mother used\nto find her crying in her bedroom and it came out by degrees that it was\nbecause Adolf had been quarrelling with her and saying sneering things\nabout her family. When her mother talked to him he was insulting. Then\nbills began to come in and Lily was expected to get me to pay them. And\nthey were not the kind of bills a decent fellow calls on another man to\npay. But I did it five or six times to make it easy for her. I didn't\ntell her that they gave an older chap than himself sidelights on the\nsituation. But that didn't work well. He thought I did it because I had\nto, and he began to feel free and easy about it, and didn't try to cover\nup his tracks so much when he sent in a new lot. He was always working\nLily. He began to consider himself master of the house. He intimated\nthat a private carriage ought to be kept for them. He said it was\nbeggarly that he should have to consider the rest of the family when he\nwanted to go out. When I got on to the situation, I began to enjoy it.\nI let him spread himself for a while just to see what he would do. Good\nLord! I couldn't have believed that any fellow could have thought any\nother fellow could be such a fool as he thought I was. He went perfectly\ncrazy after a month or so and ordered me about and patronised me as if I\nwas a bootblack he meant to teach something to. So at last I had a talk\nwith Lily and told her I was going to put an end to it. Of course she\ncried and was half frightened to death, but by that time he had ill-used\nher so that she only wanted to get rid of him. So I sent for him and had\na talk with him in my office. I led him on to saying all he had on his\nmind. He explained to me what a condescension it was for a man like\nhimself to marry a girl like Lily. He made a dignified, touching picture\nof all the disadvantages of such an alliance and all the advantages they\nought to bring in exchange to the man who bore up under them. I rubbed\nmy head and looked worried every now and then and cleared my throat\napologetically just to warm him up. I can tell you that fellow felt\nhappy, downright happy when he saw how humbly I listened to him. He\npositively swelled up with hope and comfort. He thought I was going to\nturn out well, real well. I was going to pay up just as a vulgar New\nYork father-in-law ought to do, and thank God for the blessed privilege.\nWhy, he was real eloquent about his blood and his ancestors and the\nhoary-headed Slosh. So when he'd finished, I cleared my throat in\na nervous, ingratiating kind of way again and I asked him kind of\nanxiously what he thought would be the proper thing for a base-born New\nYork millionaire to do under the circumstances--what he would approve of\nhimself.\"\n\nSir Nigel was disgusted to see the narrator twist his mouth into a\nsweet, shrewd, repressed grin even as he expectorated into the nearest\nreceptacle. The grin was greeted by a shout of laughter from his\ncompanions.\n\n\"What did he say, Stebbins?\" someone cried.\n\n\"He said,\" explained Mr. Stebbins deliberately, \"he said that an\nallowance was the proper thing. He said that a man of his rank must have\nresources, and that it wasn't dignified for him to have to ask his wife\nor his wife's father for money when he wanted it. He said an allowance\nwas what he felt he had a right to expect. And then he twisted his\nmoustache and said, 'what proposition' did I make--what would I allow\nhim?\"\n\nThe storyteller's hearers evidently knew him well. Their laughter was\nlouder than before.\n\n\"Let's hear the rest, Joe! Let's hear it!\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied Mr. Stebbins almost thoughtfully, \"I just got up and\nsaid, 'Well, it won't take long for me to answer that. I've always\nbeen fond of my children, and Lily is rather my pet. She's always had\neverything she wanted, and she always shall. She's a good girl and she\ndeserves it. I'll allow you----\" The significant deliberation of his\ndrawl could scarcely be described. \"I'll allow you just five minutes to\nget out of this room, before I kick you out, and if I kick you out of\nthe room, I'll kick you down the stairs, and if I kick you down the\nstairs, I shall have got my blood comfortably warmed up and I'll kick\nyou down the street and round the block and down to Hoboken, because\nyou're going to take the steamer there and go back to the place you came\nfrom, to the Slosh thing or whatever you call it. We haven't a damned\nbit of use for you here.' And believe it or not, gentlemen----\" looking\nround with the wry-mouthed smile, \"he took that passage and back he\nwent. And Lily's living with her mother and I mean to hold on to her.\"\n\nSir Nigel got up and left the club when the story was finished. He took\na long walk down Broadway, gnawing his lip and holding his head in the\nair. He used blasphemous language at intervals in a low voice. Some of\nit was addressed to his fate and some of it to the vulgar mercantile\ncoarseness and obtuseness of other people.\n\n\"They don't know what they are talking of,\" he said. \"It is unheard of.\nWhat do they expect? I never thought of this. Damn it! I'm like a rat in\na trap.\"\n\nIt was plain enough that he could not arrange his fortune as he had\nanticipated when he decided to begin to make love to little pink and\nwhite, doll-faced Rosy Vanderpoel. If he began to demand monetary\nadvantages in his dealing with his future wife's people in their\nsettlement of her fortune, he might arouse suspicion and inquiry. He\ndid not want inquiry either in connection with his own means or his past\nmanner of living. People who hated him would be sure to crop up with\nstories of things better left alone. There were always meddling fools\nready to interfere.\n\nHis walk was long and full of savage thinking. Once or twice as he\nrealised what the disinterestedness of his sentiments was supposed to\nbe, a short laugh broke from him which was rather like the snort of the\nBishopess.\n\n\"I am supposed to be moonstruck over a simpering American\nchit--moonstruck! Damn!\" But when he returned to his hotel he had made\nup his mind and was beginning to look over the situation in evil cold\nblood. Matters must be settled without delay and he was shrewd enough to\nrealise that with his temper and its varied resources a timid girl\nwould not be difficult to manage. He had seen at an early stage of their\nacquaintance that Rosy was greatly impressed by the superiority of\nhis bearing, that he could make her blush with embarrassment when he\nconveyed to her that she had made a mistake, that he could chill her\nmiserably when he chose to assume a lofty stiffness. A man's domestic\narmoury was filled with weapons if he could make a woman feel gauche,\ninexperienced, in the wrong. When he was safely married, he could pave\nthe way to what he felt was the only practical and feasible end.\n\nIf he had been marrying a woman with more brains, she would be more\ndifficult to subdue, but with Rosalie Vanderpoel, processes were\nnot necessary. If you shocked, bewildered or frightened her with\naccusations, sulks, or sneers, her light, innocent head was set in such\na whirl that the rest was easy. It was possible, upon the whole, that\nthe thing might not turn out so infernally ill after all. Supposing that\nit had been Bettina who had been the marriageable one! Appreciating to\nthe full the many reasons for rejoicing that she had not been, he walked\nin gloomy reflection home.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nYOUNG LADY ANSTRUTHERS\n\nWhen the marriage took place the event was accompanied by an ingenuously\nelate flourish of trumpets. Miss Vanderpoel's frocks were multitudinous\nand wonderful, as also her jewels purchased at Tiffany's. She carried\na thousand trunks--more or less--across the Atlantic. When the ship\nsteamed away from the dock, the wharf was like a flower garden in the\nblaze of brilliant and delicate attire worn by the bevy of relatives and\nintimates who stood waving their handkerchiefs and laughingly calling\nout farewell good wishes.\n\nSir Nigel's mental attitude was not a sympathetic or admiring one as\nhe stood by his bride's side looking back. If Rosy's half happy,\nhalf tearful excitement had left her the leisure to reflect on his\nexpression, she would not have felt it encouraging.\n\n\"What a deuce of a row Americans make,\" he said even before they were\nout of hearing of the voices. \"It will be a positive rest to be in a\ncountry where the women do not cackle and shriek with laughter.\"\n\nHe said it with that simple rudeness which at times professed to be\nalmost impersonal, and which Rosalie had usually tried to believe was\nthe outcome of a kind of cool British humour. But this time she started\na little at his words.\n\n\"I suppose we do make more noise than English people,\" she admitted\na second or so later. \"I wonder why?\" And without waiting for an\nanswer--somewhat as if she had not expected or quite wanted one--she\nleaned a little farther over the side to look back, waving her small,\nfluttering handkerchief to the many still in tumult on the wharf. She\nwas not perceptive or quick enough to take offence, to realise that the\nremark was significant and that Sir Nigel had already begun as he meant\nto go on. It was far from being his intention to play the part of an\nAmerican husband, who was plainly a creature in whom no authority vested\nitself. Americans let their women say and do anything, and were capable\nof fetching and carrying for them. He had seen a man run upstairs for\nhis wife's wrap, cheerfully, without the least apparent sense that\nthe service was the part of a footman if there was one in the house, a\nparlour maid if there was not. Sir Nigel had been brought up in the good\nEarly Victorian days when \"a nice little woman to fetch your slippers\nfor you\" figured in certain circles as domestic bliss. Girls were\neducated to fetch slippers as retrievers were trained to go into the\nwater after sticks, and terriers to bring back balls thrown for them.\n\nThe new Lady Anstruthers had, it supervened, several opportunities to\nobtain a new view of her bridegroom's character before their voyage\nacross the Atlantic was over. At this period of the slower and more\ncumbrous weaving of the Shuttle, the world had not yet awakened even to\nthe possibilities of the ocean greyhound. An Atlantic voyage at times\nwas capable of offering to a bride and bridegroom days enough to begin\nto glance into their future with a premonition of the waning of the\nhoneymoon, at least, and especially if they were not sea-proof, to wish\nwearily that the first half of it were over. Rosalie was not weary, but\nshe began to be bewildered. As she had never been a clever girl or quick\nto perceive, and had spent her life among women-indulging American men,\nshe was not prepared with any precedent which made her situation clear.\nThe first time Sir Nigel showed his temper to her she simply stared at\nhim, her eyes looking like those of a puzzled, questioning child. Then\nshe broke into her nervous little laugh, because she did not know what\nelse to do. At his second outbreak her stare was rather startled and she\ndid not laugh.\n\nHer first awakening was to an anxious wonderment concerning certain\nmoods of gloom, or what seemed to be gloom, to which he seemed prone. As\nshe lay in her steamer chair he would at times march stiffly up and\ndown the deck, apparently aware of no other existence than his own,\nhis features expressing a certain clouded resentment of whose very\nunexplainableness she secretly stood in awe. She was not astute enough,\npoor girl, to leave him alone, and when with innocent questionings she\nendeavoured to discover his trouble, the greatest mystification she\nencountered was that he had the power to make her feel that she was in\nsome way taking a liberty, and showing her lack of tact and perspicuity.\n\n\"Is anything the matter, Nigel?\" she asked at first, wondering if she\nwere guilty of silliness in trying to slip her hand into his. She was\nsure she had been when he answered her.\n\n\"No,\" he said chillingly.\n\n\"I don't believe you are happy,\" she returned. \"Somehow you seem so--so\ndifferent.\"\n\n\"I have reasons for being depressed,\" he replied, and it was with a\nstiff finality which struck a note of warning to her, signifying that it\nwould be better taste in her to put an end to her simple efforts.\n\nShe vaguely felt herself put in the wrong, and he preferred that it\nshould be so. It was the best form of preparation for any mood he might\nsee that it might pay him to show her in the future. He was, in fact,\nconfronting disdainfully his position. He had her on his hands and he\nwas returning to his relations with no definite advantage to exhibit as\nthe result of having married her. She had been supplied with an income\nbut he had no control over it. It would not have been so if he had\nnot been in such straits that he had been afraid to risk his chance by\nmaking a stand. To have a wife with money, a silly, sweet temper and no\nwill of her own, was of course better than to be penniless, head over\nheels in debt and hemmed in by difficulties on every side. He had seen\nwomen trained to give in to anything rather than be bullied in public,\nto accede in the end to any demand rather than endure the shame of\na certain kind of scene made before servants, and a certain kind of\ninsolence used to relatives and guests. The quality he found\nmost maddeningly irritating in Rosalie was her obviously absolute\nunconsciousness of the fact that it was entirely natural and proper that\nher resources should be in her husband's hands. He had, indeed, even\nin these early days, made a tentative effort or so in the form of a\nsuggestive speech; he had given her openings to give him an opening to\nput things on a practical basis, but she had never had the intelligence\nto see what he was aiming at, and he had found himself almost\nfloundering ungracefully in his remarks, while she had looked at him\nwithout a sign of comprehension in her simple, anxious blue eyes. The\ncreature was actually trying to understand him and could not. That was\nthe worst of it, the blank wall of her unconsciousness, her childlike\nbelief that he was far too grand a personage to require anything. These\nwere the things he was thinking over when he walked up and down the deck\nin unamiable solitariness. Rosy awakened to the amazed consciousness of\nthe fact that, instead of being pleased with the luxury and prettiness\nof her wardrobe and appointments, he seemed to dislike and disdain them.\n\n\"You American women change your clothes too much and think too much of\nthem,\" was one of his first amiable criticisms. \"You spend more than\nwell-bred women should spend on mere dresses and bonnets. In New York it\nalways strikes an Englishman that the women look endimanche at whatever\ntime of day you come across them.\"\n\n\"Oh, Nigel!\" cried Rosy woefully. She could not think of anything more\nto say than, \"Oh, Nigel!\"\n\n\"I am sorry to say it is true,\" he replied loftily. That she was an\nAmerican and a New Yorker was being impressed upon poor little Lady\nAnstruthers in a new way--somehow as if the mere cold statement of the\nfact put a fine edge of sarcasm to any remark. She was of too innocent a\nloyalty to wish that she was neither the one nor the other, but she did\nwish that Nigel was not so prejudiced against the places and people she\ncared for so much.\n\nShe was sitting in her stateroom enfolded in a dressing gown covered\nwith cascades of lace, tied with knots of embroidered ribbon, and her\nmaid, Hannah, who admired her greatly, was brushing her fair long hair\nwith a gold-backed brush, ornamented with a monogram of jewels.\n\nIf she had been a French duchess of a piquant type, or an English one\nwith an aquiline nose, she would have been beyond criticism; if she had\nbeen a plump, over-fed woman, or an ugly, ill-natured, gross one, she\nwould have looked vulgar, but she was a little, thin, fair New\nYorker, and though she was not beyond criticism--if one demanded high\ndistinction--she was pretty and nice to look at. But Nigel Anstruthers\nwould not allow this to her. His own tailors' bills being far in\narrears and his pocket disgustingly empty, the sight of her ingenuous\nsumptuousness and the gay, accustomed simpleness of outlook with which\nshe accepted it as her natural right, irritated him and roused his\nvenom. Bills would remain unpaid if she was permitted to spend her money\non this sort of thing without any consideration for the requirements of\nother people.\n\nHe inhaled the air and made a gesture of distaste.\n\n\"This sachet business is rather overpowering,\" he said. \"It is the sort\nof thing a woman should be particularly discreet about.\"\n\n\"Oh, Nigel!\" cried the poor girl agitatedly. \"Hannah, do go and call\nthe steward to open the windows. Is it really strong?\" she implored as\nHannah went out. \"How dreadful. It's only orris and I didn't know Hannah\nhad put it in the trunks.\"\n\n\"My dear Rosalie,\" with a wave of the hand taking in both herself and\nher dressing case, \"it is all too strong.\"\n\n\"All--wh--what?\" gaspingly.\n\n\"The whole thing. All that lace and love knot arrangement, the\ngold-backed brushes and scent bottles with diamonds and rubies sticking\nin them.\"\n\n\"They--they were wedding presents. They came from Tiffany's. Everyone\nthought them lovely.\"\n\n\"They look as if they belonged to the dressing table of a French woman\nof the demi-monde. I feel as if I had actually walked into the apartment\nof some notorious Parisian soubrette.\"\n\nRosalie Vanderpoel was a clean-minded little person, her people were of\nthe clean-minded type, therefore she did not understand all that this\nironic speech implied, but she gathered enough of its significance to\ncause her to turn first red and then pale and then to burst into tears.\nShe was crying and trying to conceal the fact when Hannah returned.\nShe bent her head and touched her eyes furtively while her toilette was\ncompleted.\n\nSir Nigel had retired from the scene, but he had done so feeling that he\nhad planted a seed and bestowed a practical lesson. He had, it is true,\nbestowed one, but again she had not understood its significance and was\nonly left bewildered and unhappy. She began to be nervous and uncertain\nabout herself and about his moods and points of view. She had never been\nmade to feel so at home. Everyone had been kind to her and lenient to\nher lack of brilliancy. No one had expected her to be brilliant, and she\nhad been quite sweet-temperedly resigned to the fact that she was not\nthe kind of girl who shone either in society or elsewhere. She did not\nresent the fact that she knew people said of her, \"She isn't in the\nleast bit bright, Rosy Vanderpoel, but she's a nice, sweet little\nthing.\" She had tried to be nice and sweet and had aspired to nothing\nhigher.\n\nBut now that seemed so much less than enough. Perhaps Nigel ought to\nhave married one of the clever ones, someone who would have known how to\nunderstand him and who would have been more entertaining than she could\nbe. Perhaps she was beginning to bore him, perhaps he was finding her\nout and beginning to get tired. At this point the always too ready\ntears would rise to her eyes and she would be overwhelmed by a sense of\nhomesickness. Often she cried herself silently to sleep, longing for\nher mother--her nice, comfortable, ordinary mother, whom she had several\ntimes felt Nigel had some difficulty in being unreservedly polite\nto--though he had been polite on the surface.\n\nBy the time they landed she had been living under so much strain in her\neffort to seem quite unchanged, that she had lost her nerve. She did not\nfeel well and was sometimes afraid that she might do something silly and\nhysterical in spite of herself, begin to cry for instance when there was\nreally no explanation for her doing it. But when she reached London the\nnovelty of everything so excited her that she thought she was going to\nbe better, and then she said to herself it would be proved to her that\nall her fears had been nonsense. This return of hope made her quite\nlight-spirited, and she was almost gay in her little outbursts of\ndelight and admiration as she drove about the streets with her husband.\nShe did not know that her ingenuous ignorance of things he had known all\nhis life, her rapture over common monuments of history, led him to say\nto himself that he felt rather as if he were taking a housemaid to see a\nLord Mayor's Show.\n\nBefore going to Stornham Court they spent a few days in town. There had\nbeen no intention of proclaiming their presence to the world, and they\ndid not do so, but unluckily certain tradesmen discovered the fact that\nSir Nigel Anstruthers had returned to England with the bride he had\nsecured in New York. The conclusion to be deduced from this circumstance\nwas that the particular moment was a good one at which to send in bills\nfor \"acct. rendered.\" The tradesmen quite shared Anstruthers' point\nof view. Their reasoning was delightfully simple and they were wholly\nunaware that it might have been called gross. A man over his head and\nears in debt naturally expected his creditors would be paid by the young\nwoman who had married him. America had in these days been so little\nexplored by the thrifty impecunious well-born that its ingenuous\nsentimentality in certain matters was by no means comprehended.\n\nBy each post Sir Nigel received numerous bills. Sometimes letters\naccompanied them, and once or twice respectful but firm male persons\nbrought them by hand and demanded interviews which irritated Sir Nigel\nextremely. Given time to arrange matters with Rosalie, to train her to\nsome sense of her duty, he believed that the \"acct. rendered\" could be\nwiped off, but he saw he must have time. She was such a little fool.\nAgain and again he was furious at the fate which had forced him to take\nher.\n\nThe truth was that Rosalie knew nothing whatever about unpaid bills.\nReuben Vanderpoel's daughters had never encountered an indignant\ntradesman in their lives. When they went into \"stores\" they were\nreceived with unfeigned rapture. Everything was dragged forth to be\ndisplayed to them, attendants waited to leap forth to supply their\nsmallest behest. They knew no other phase of existence than the one in\nwhich one could buy anything one wanted and pay any price demanded for\nit.\n\nConsequently Rosalie did not recognise signs which would have been\nobviously recognisable by the initiated. If Sir Nigel Anstruthers had\nbeen a nice young fellow who had loved her, and he had been honest\nenough to make a clean breast of his difficulties, she would have thrown\nherself into his arms and implored him effusively to make use of all\nher available funds, and if the supply had been insufficient, would have\nimmediately written to her father for further donations, knowing that\nher appeal would be responded to at once. But Sir Nigel Anstruthers\ncherished no sentiment for any other individual than himself, and he\nhad no intention of explaining that his mere vanity had caused him to\nmislead her, that his rank and estate counted for nothing and that he\nwas in fact a pauper loaded with dishonest debts. He wanted money, but\nhe wanted it to be given to him as if he conferred a favour by receiving\nit. It must be transferred to him as though it were his by right. What\ndid a man marry for? Therefore his wife's unconsciousness that she was\ninflicting outrage upon him by her mere mental attitude filled his being\nwith slowly rising gall.\n\nPoor Rosalie went joyfully forth shopping after the manner of all newly\narrived Americans. She bought new toilettes and gewgaws and presents\nfor her friends and relations in New York, and each package which was\ndelivered at the hotel added to Sir Nigel's rage.\n\nThat the little blockhead should be allowed to do what she liked with\nher money and that he should not be able to forbid her! This he said\nto himself at intervals of five minutes through the day--which led to\nanother small episode.\n\n\"You are spending a great deal of money,\" he said one morning in his\ncondemnatory manner. Rosalie looked up from the lace flounce which\nhad just been delivered and gave the little nervous laugh, which was\nbecoming entirely uncertain of propitiating.\n\n\"Am I?\" she answered. \"They say all Americans spend a good deal.\"\n\n\"Your money ought to be in proper hands and properly managed,\" he went\non with cold precision. \"If you were an English woman, your husband\nwould control it.\"\n\n\"Would he?\" The simple, sweet-tempered obtuseness of her tone was an\ninfuriating thing to him. There was the usual shade of troubled surprise\nin her eyes as they met his. \"I don't think men in America ever do that.\nI don't believe the nice ones want to. You see they have such a pride\nabout always giving things to women, and taking care of them. I believe\na nice American man would break stones in the street rather than take\nmoney from a woman--even his wife. I mean while he could work. Of course\nif he was ill or had ill luck or anything like that, he wouldn't be so\nproud as not to take it from the person who loved him most and wanted\nto help him. You do sometimes hear of a man who won't work and lets his\nwife support him, but it's very seldom, and they are always the low kind\nthat other men look down on.\"\n\n\"Wanted to help him.\" Sir Nigel selected the phrase and quoted it\nbetween puffs of the cigar he held in his fine, rather cruel-looking\nhands, and his voice expressed a not too subtle sneer. \"A woman is not\n'helping' her husband when she gives him control of her fortune. She\nis only doing her duty and accepting her proper position with regard to\nhim. The law used to settle the thing definitely.\"\n\n\"Did-did it?\" Rosy faltered weakly. She knew he was offended again and\nthat she was once more somehow in the wrong. So many things about her\nseemed to displease him, and when he was displeased he always reminded\nher that she was stupidly, objectionably guilty of not being an English\nwoman.\n\nWhatsoever it happened to be, the fault she had committed out of her\ndepth of ignorance, he did not forget it. It was no habit of his to\nendeavour to dismiss offences. He preferred to hold them in possession\nas if they were treasures and to turn them over and over, in the mental\nseclusion which nourishes the growth of injuries, since within its\nbarriers there is no chance of their being palliated by the apologies or\nexplanations of the offender.\n\nDuring their journey to Stornham Court the next day he was in one of his\nblack moods. Once in the railway carriage he paid small attention to\nhis wife, but sat rigidly reading his Times, until about midway to their\ndestination he descended at a station and paid a visit to the buffet in\nthe small refreshment room, after which he settled himself to doze in\nan exceedingly unbecoming attitude, his travelling cap pulled down,\nhis rather heavy face congested with the dark flush Rosalie had not yet\nlearned was due to the fact that he had hastily tossed off two or three\nwhiskies and sodas. Though he was never either thick of utterance or\nunsteady on his feet, whisky and soda formed an important factor in his\nexistence. When he was annoyed or dull he at once took the necessary\nprecautions against being overcome by these feelings, and the effect\nupon a constitutionally evil temper was to transform it into an infernal\none. The night had been a bad one for Rosy. Such floods of homesick\nlonging had overpowered her that she had not been able to sleep. She had\nrisen feeling shaky and hysterical and her nervousness had been added to\nby her fear that Nigel might observe her and make comment. Of course\nshe told herself it was natural that he should not wish her to appear at\nStornham Court looking a pale, pink-nosed little fright. Her efforts\nto be cheerful had indeed been somewhat touching, but they had met with\nsmall encouragement.\n\nShe thought the green-clothed country lovely as the train sped through\nit, and a lump rose in her small throat because she knew she might have\nbeen so happy if she had not been so frightened and miserable. The thing\nwhich had been dawning upon her took clearer, more awful form. Incidents\nshe had tried to explain and excuse to herself, upon all sorts of\nfutile, simple grounds, began to loom up before her in something like\ntheir actual proportions. She had heard of men who had changed their\nmanner towards girls after they had married them, but she did not know\nthey had begun to change so soon. This was so early in the honeymoon to\nbe sitting in a railway carriage, in a corner remote from that occupied\nby a bridegroom, who read his paper in what was obviously intentional,\nresentful solitude. Emily Soame's father, she remembered it against her\nwill, had been obliged to get a divorce for Emily after her two years\nof wretched married life. But Alfred Soames had been quite nice for six\nmonths at least. It seemed as if all this must be a dream, one of those\nnightmare things, in which you suddenly find yourself married to\nsomeone you cannot bear, and you don't know how it happened, because you\nyourself have had nothing to do with the matter. She felt that presently\nshe must waken with a start and find herself breathing fast, and panting\nout, half laughing, half crying, \"Oh, I am so glad it's not true! I am\nso glad it's not true!\"\n\nBut this was true, and there was Nigel. And she was in a new, unexplored\nworld. Her little trembling hands clutched each other. The happy, light\ngirlish days full of ease and friendliness and decency seemed gone\nforever. It was not Rosalie Vanderpoel who pressed her colourless face\nagainst the glass of the window, looking out at the flying trees; it was\nthe wife of Nigel Anstruthers, and suddenly, by some hideous magic, she\nhad been snatched from the world to which she belonged and was being\ndragged by a gaoler to a prison from which she did not know how to\nescape. Already Nigel had managed to convey to her that in England a\nwoman who was married could do nothing to defend herself against her\nhusband, and that to endeavour to do anything was the last impossible\ntouch of vulgar ignominy.\n\nThe vivid realisation of the situation seized upon her like a possession\nas she glanced sideways at her bridegroom and hurriedly glanced away\nagain with a little hysterical shudder. New York, good-tempered,\nlenient, free New York, was millions of miles away and Nigel was so\nloathly near and--and so ugly. She had never known before that he was so\nugly, that his face was so heavy, his skin so thick and coarse and his\nexpression so evilly ill-tempered. She was not sufficiently analytical\nto be conscious that she had with one bound leaped to the appalling\npoint of feeling uncontrollable physical abhorrence of the creature\nto whom she was chained for life. She was terrified at finding herself\nforced to combat the realisation that there were certain expressions\nof his countenance which made her feel sick with repulsion. Her\nself-reproach also was as great as her terror. He was her husband--her\nhusband--and she was a wicked girl. She repeated the words to herself\nagain and again, but remotely she knew that when she said, \"He is my\nhusband,\" that was the worst thing of all.\n\nThis inward struggle was a bad preparation for any added misery, and\nwhen their railroad journey terminated at Stornham Station she was met\nby new bewilderment.\n\nThe station itself was a rustic place where wild roses climbed down a\nbank to meet the very train itself. The station master's cottage had\nroses and clusters of lilies waving in its tiny garden. The station\nmaster, a good-natured, red-faced man, came forward, baring his head,\nto open the railroad carriage door with his own hand. Rosy thought him\ndelightful and bowed and smiled sweet-temperedly to him and to his\nwife and little girls, who were curtseying at the garden gate. She was\nsufficiently homesick to be actually grateful to them for their air of\nwelcoming her. But as she smiled she glanced furtively at Nigel to see\nif she was doing exactly the right thing.\n\nHe himself was not smiling and did not unbend even when the station\nmaster, who had known him from his boyhood, felt at liberty to offer a\ndeferential welcome.\n\n\"Happy to see you home with her ladyship, Sir Nigel,\" he said; \"very\nhappy, if I may say so.\"\n\nSir Nigel responded to the respectful amiability with a half-military\nlifting of his right hand, accompanied by a grunt.\n\n\"D'ye do, Wells,\" he said, and strode past him to speak to the footman\nwho had come from Stornham Court with the carriage.\n\nThe new and nervous little Lady Anstruthers, who was left to trot after\nher husband, smiled again at the ruddy, kind-looking fellow, this time\nin conscious deprecation. In the simplicity of her republican sympathy\nwith a well-meaning fellow creature who might feel himself snubbed,\nshe could have shaken him by the hand. She had even parted her lips to\nventure a word of civility when she was startled by hearing Sir Nigel's\nvoice raised in angry rating.\n\n\"Damned bad management not to bring something else,\" she heard. \"Kind of\nthing you fellows are always doing.\"\n\nShe made her way to the carriage, flurried again by not knowing whether\nshe was doing right or wrong. Sir Nigel had given her no instructions\nand she had not yet learned that when he was in a certain humour there\nwas equal fault in obeying or disobeying such orders as he gave.\n\nThe carriage from the Court--not in the least a new or smart\nequipage--was drawn up before the entrance of the station and Sir Nigel\nwas in a rage because the vehicle brought for the luggage was too small\nto carry it all.\n\n\"Very sorry, Sir Nigel,\" said the coachman, touching his hat two or\nthree times in his agitation. \"Very sorry. The omnibus was a little out\nof order--the springs, Sir Nigel--and I thought----\"\n\n\"You thought!\" was the heated interruption. \"What right had you to\nthink, damn it! You are not paid to think, you are paid to do your\nwork properly. Here are a lot of damned boxes which ought to go with us\nand--where's your maid?\" wheeling round upon his wife.\n\nRosalie turned towards the woman, who was approaching from the waiting\nroom.\n\n\"Hannah,\" she said timorously.\n\n\"Drop those confounded bundles,\" ordered Sir Nigel, \"and show James the\nboxes her ladyship is obliged to have this evening. Be quick about it\nand don't pick out half a dozen. The cart can't take them.\"\n\nHannah looked frightened. This sort of thing was new to her, too. She\nshuffled her packages on to a seat and followed the footman to the\nluggage. Sir Nigel continued rating the coachman. Any form of violent\nself-assertion was welcome to him at any time, and when he was irritated\nhe found it a distinct luxury to kick a dog or throw a boot at a cat.\nThe springs of the omnibus, he argued, had no right to be broken when\nit was known that he was coming home. His anger was only added to by the\ncoachman's halting endeavours in his excuses to veil a fact he knew his\nmaster was aware of, that everything at Stornham was more or less out of\norder, and that dilapidations were the inevitable result of there being\nno money to pay for repairs. The man leaned forward on his box and spoke\nat last in a low tone.\n\n\"The bus has been broken some time,\" he said. \"It's--it's an expensive\njob, Sir Nigel. Her ladyship thought it better to----\" Sir Nigel turned\nwhite about the mouth.\n\n\"Hold your tongue,\" he commanded, and the coachman got red in the face,\nsaluted, biting his lips, and sat very stiff and upright on his box.\n\nThe station master edged away uneasily and tried to look as if he were\nnot listening. But Rosalie could see that he could not help hearing, nor\ncould the country people who had been passengers by the train and who\nwere collecting their belongings and getting into their traps.\n\nLady Anstruthers was ignored and remained standing while the scene\nwent on. She could not help recalling the manner in which she had been\ninvariably received in New York on her return from any journey, how she\nwas met by comfortable, merry people and taken care of at once. This was\nso strange, it was so queer, so different.\n\n\"Oh, never mind, Nigel dear,\" she said at last, with innocent\nindiscretion. \"It doesn't really matter, you know.\"\n\nSir Nigel turned upon her a blaze of haughty indignation.\n\n\"If you'll pardon my saying so, it does matter,\" he said. \"It matters\nconfoundedly. Be good enough to take your place in the carriage.\"\n\nHe moved to the carriage door, and not too civilly put her in. She\ngasped a little for breath as she sat down. He had spoken to her as if\nshe had been an impertinent servant who had taken a liberty. The poor\ngirl was bewildered to the verge of panic. When he had ended his tirade\nand took his place beside her he wore his most haughtily intolerant air.\n\n\"May I request that in future you will be good enough not to interfere\nwhen I am reproving my servants,\" he remarked.\n\n\"I didn't mean to interfere,\" she apologised tremulously.\n\n\"I don't know what you meant. I only know what you did,\" was his\nresponse. \"You American women are too fond of cutting in. An Englishman\ncan think for himself without his wife's assistance.\"\n\nThe tears rose to her eyes. The introduction of the international\nquestion overpowered her as always.\n\n\"Don't begin to be hysterical,\" was the ameliorating tenderness with\nwhich he observed the two hot salt drops which fell despite her. \"I\nshould scarcely wish to present you to my mother bathed in tears.\"\n\nShe wiped the salt drops hastily away and sat for a moment silent in the\ncorner of the carriage. Being wholly primitive and unanalytical, she was\nashamed and began to blame herself. He was right. She must not be silly\nbecause she was unused to things. She ought not to be disturbed by\ntrifles. She must try to be nice and look cheerful. She made an effort\nand did no speak for a few minutes. When she had recovered herself she\ntried again.\n\n\"English country is so pretty,\" she said, when she thought she was quite\nsure that her voice would not tremble. \"I do so like the hedges and the\ndarling little red-roofed cottages.\"\n\nIt was an innocent tentative at saying something agreeable which might\npropitiate him. She was beginning to realise that she was continually\nmaking efforts to propitiate him. But one of the forms of unpleasantness\nmost enjoyable to him was the snubbing of any gentle effort at\npalliating his mood. He condescended in this case no response whatever,\nbut merely continued staring contemptuously before him.\n\n\"It is so picturesque, and so unlike America,\" was the pathetic little\ncommonplace she ventured next. \"Ain't it, Nigel?\"\n\nHe turned his head slowly towards her, as if she had taken a new liberty\nin disturbing his meditations.\n\n\"Wha--at?\" he drawled.\n\nIt was almost too much for her to sustain herself under. Her courage\ncollapsed.\n\n\"I was only saying how pretty the cottages were,\" she faltered. \"And\nthat there's nothing like this in America.\"\n\n\"You ended your remark by adding, 'ain't it,'\" her husband\ncondescended. \"There is nothing like that in England. I shall ask you to\ndo me the favour of leaving Americanisms out of your conversation when\nyou are in the society of English ladies and gentlemen. It won't do.\"\n\n\"I didn't know I said it,\" Rosy answered feebly.\n\n\"That is the difficulty,\" was his response. \"You never know, but\neducated people do.\"\n\nThere was nothing more to be said, at least for a girl who had never\nknown what it was to be bullied. This one felt like a beggar or a\nscullery maid, who, being rated by her master, had not the refuge of\nbeing able to \"give warning.\" She could never give warning. The Atlantic\nOcean was between her and those who had loved and protected her all\nher short life, and the carriage was bearing her onwards to the home in\nwhich she was to live alone as this man's companion to the end of her\nexistence.\n\nShe made no further propitiatory efforts, but sat and stared in simple\nblankness at the country, which seemed to increase in loveliness at each\nnew point of view. Sometimes she saw sweet wooded, rolling lands made\nlovelier by the homely farmhouses and cottages enclosed and sheltered by\nthick hedges and trees; once or twice they drove past a park enfolding\na great house guarded by its huge sentinel oaks and beeches; once the\ncarriage passed through an adorable little village, where children\nplayed on the green and a square-towered grey church seemed to watch\nover the steep-roofed cottages and creeper-covered vicarage. If she had\nbeen a happy American tourist travelling in company with impressionable\nfriends, she would have broken into ecstatic little exclamations of\nadmiration every five minutes, but it had been driven home to her that\nto her present companion, to whom nothing was new, her rapture would\nmerely represent the crudeness which had existed in contentment in a\nbrown-stone house on a noisy thoroughfare, through a life which had been\npassed tramping up and down numbered streets and avenues.\n\nThey approached at last a second village with a green, a grass-grown\nstreet and the irregular red-tiled cottages, which to the unaccustomed\neye seemed rather to represent studies for sketches than absolute\nrealities. The bells in the church tower broke forth into a chime and\npeople appeared at the doors of the cottages. The men touched their\nforeheads as the carriage passed, and the children made bobbing\ncurtsies. Sir Nigel condescended to straighten himself a trifle in his\nseat, and recognised the greetings with the stiff, half-military salute.\nThe poor girl at his side felt that he put as little feeling as possible\ninto the movement, and that if she herself had been a bowing villager\nshe would almost have preferred to be wholly ignored. She looked at him\nquestioningly.\n\n\"Are they--must _I_?\" she began.\n\n\"Make some civil recognition,\" answered Sir Nigel, as if he were\ninstructing an ignorant child. \"It is customary.\"\n\nSo she bowed and tried to smile, and the joyous clamour of the bells\nbrought the awful lump into her throat again. It reminded her of\nthe ringing of the chimes at the New York church on that day of her\nmarriage, which had been so full of gay, luxurious bustle, so crowded\nwith wedding presents, and flowers, and warm-hearted, affectionate\ncongratulations, and good wishes uttered in merry American voices.\n\nThe park at Stornham Court was large and beautiful and old. The trees\nwere magnificent, and the broad sweep of sward and rich dip of ferny\ndell all that the imagination could desire. The Court itself was old,\nand many-gabled and mellow-red and fine. Rosalie had learned from no\nprecedent as yet that houses of its kind may represent the apotheosis\nof discomfort and dilapidation within, and only become more beautiful\nwithout. Tumbled-down chimneys and broken tiles, being clambered over by\ntossing ivy, are pictures to delight the soul.\n\nAs she descended from the carriage the girl was tremulous and uncertain\nof herself and much overpowered by the unbending air of the man-servant\nwho received her as if she were a parcel in which it was no part of his\nduty to take the smallest interest. As she mounted the stone steps she\ncaught a glimpse of broad gloom within the threshold, a big, square,\ndingy hall where some other servants were drawn up in a row. She had\nread of something of the sort in English novels, and she was suddenly\nembarrassed afresh by her realisation of the fact that she did not know\nwhat to do and that if she made a mistake Nigel would never forgive her.\n\nAn elderly woman came out of a room opening into the hall. She was an\nugly woman of a rigid carriage, which, with the obvious intention of\nbeing severely majestic, was only antagonistic. She had a flaccid\nchin, and was curiously like Nigel. She had also his expression when he\nintended to be disagreeable. She was the Dowager Lady Anstruthers,\nand being an entirely revolting old person at her best, she objected\nextremely to the transatlantic bride who had made her a dowager, though\nshe was determinedly prepared to profit by any practical benefit likely\nto accrue.\n\n\"Well, Nigel,\" she said in a deep voice. \"Here you are at last.\"\n\nThis was of course a statement not to be refuted. She held out a\nleathern cheek, and as Sir Nigel also presented his, their caress of\ngreeting was a singular and not effusive one.\n\n\"Is this your wife?\" she asked, giving Rosalie a bony hand. And as he\ndid not indignantly deny this to be the fact, she added, \"How do you\ndo?\"\n\nRosalie murmured a reply and tried to control herself by making another\neffort to swallow the lump in her throat. But she could not swallow\nit. She had been keeping a desperate hold on herself too long. The\nbewildered misery of her awakening, the awkwardness of the public row\nat the station, the sulks which had filled the carriage to repletion\nthrough all the long drive, and finally the jangling bells which had\nso recalled that last joyous day at home--at home--had brought her to\na point where this meeting between mother and son--these two stony,\nunpleasant creatures exchanging a reluctant rub of uninviting cheeks--as\ntwo savages might have rubbed noses--proved the finishing impetus to\nhysteria. They were so hideous, these two, and so ghastly comic and\nfantastic in their unresponsive glumness, that the poor girl lost all\nhold upon herself and broke into a trembling shriek of laughter.\n\n\"Oh!\" she gasped in terror at what she felt to be her indecent madness.\n\"Oh! how--how----\" And then seeing Nigel's furious start, his mother's\nglare and all the servants' alarmed stare at her, she rushed staggering\nto the only creature she felt she knew--her maid Hannah, clutched her\nand broke down into wild sobbing.\n\n\"Oh, take me away!\" she cried. \"Oh, do! Oh, do! Oh, Hannah! Oh,\nmother--mother!\"\n\n\"Take your mistress to her room,\" commanded Sir Nigel. \"Go downstairs,\"\nhe called out to the servants. \"Take her upstairs at once and throw\nwater in her face,\" to the excited Hannah.\n\nAnd as the new Lady Anstruthers was half led, half dragged, in\nhumiliated hysteric disorder up the staircase, he took his mother by the\nelbow, marched her into the nearest room and shut the door. There they\nstood and stared at each other, breathing quick, enraged breaths and\nlooking particularly alike with their heavy-featured, thick-skinned,\ninfuriated faces.\n\nIt was the Dowager who spoke first, and her whole voice and manner\nexpressed all she intended that they should, all the derision, dislike\nand scathing resignment to a grotesque fate.\n\n\"Well,\" said her ladyship. \"So THIS is what you have brought home from\nAmerica!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nA MISTAKE OF THE POSTBOY'S\n\nAs the weeks passed at Stornham Court the Atlantic Ocean seemed to\nRosalie Anstruthers to widen endlessly, and gay, happy, noisy New York\nto recede until it was as far away as some memory of heaven. The girl\nhad been born in the midst of the rattling, rumbling bustle, and it\nhad never struck her as assuming the character of noise; she had only\nthought of it as being the cheerful confusion inseparable from town. She\nhad been secretly offended and hurt when strangers said that New York\nwas noisy and dirty; when they called it vulgar, she never wholly\nforgave them. She was of the New Yorkers who adore their New York\nas Parisians adore Paris and who feel that only within its beloved\nboundaries can the breath of life be breathed. People were often too hot\nor too cold there, but there was usually plenty of bright glaring sun,\nand the extremes of the weather had at least something rather dramatic\nabout them. There were dramatic incidents connected with them, at any\nrate. People fell dead of sunstroke or were frozen to death, and the\nnewspapers were full of anecdotes during a \"cold snap\" or a \"torrid\nwave,\" which all made for excitement and conversation.\n\nBut at Stornham the rain seemed to young Lady Anstruthers to descend\nceaselessly. The season was a wet one, and when she rose in the morning\nand looked out over the huge stretch of trees and sward she thought she\nalways saw the rain falling either in hopeless sheets or more hopeless\ndrizzle. The occasions upon which this was a dreary truth blotted out or\nblurred the exceptions, when in liquid ultramarine deeps of sky, floated\nislands and mountains of snow-white fleece, of a beauty of which she had\nbefore had no conception.\n\nIn the English novels she had read, places such as Stornham Court were\nalways filled with \"house parties,\" made up of wonderful town wits and\nbeauties, who provided endless entertainment for each other, who played\ngames, who hunted and shot pheasants and shone in dazzling amateur\ntheatricals. There were, however, no visitors at Stornham, and there\nwere in fact, no accommodations for any. There were numberless bedrooms,\nbut none really fit for guests to occupy. Carpets and curtains were\nancient and ragged, furniture was dilapidated, chimneys would not draw,\nbeds were falling to pieces. The Dowager Lady Anstruthers had never\neither attracted desired, or been able to afford company. Her son's wife\nsuffered from the resulting boredom and unpopularity without being able\nto comprehend the significance of the situation.\n\nAs the weeks dragged by a few heavy carriages deposited at the Court\na few callers. Some of the visitors bore imposing titles, which made\nRosalie very nervous and caused her hastily to array herself to receive\nthem in toilettes much too pretty and delicate for the occasion. Her\ninnocent idea was that she must do her husband credit by appearing as\n\"stylish\" as possible.\n\nAs a result she was stared at, either with open disfavour, or with\nwell-bred, furtive criticism, and was described afterwards as being\neither \"very American\" or \"very over-dressed.\" When she had lived in\nhuge rooms in Fifth Avenue, Rosalie had changed her attire as many times\na day as she had changed her fancy; every hour had been filled with\nengagements and amusements; the Vanderpoel carriages had driven up\nto the door and driven away again and again through the mornings and\nafternoons and until midnight and later. Someone was always going out or\ncoming in. There had been in the big handsome house not much more of an\nair of repose than one might expect to find at a railway station; but\nthe flurry, the coming and going, the calling and chatting had all been\ncheery, amiable. At Stornham, Rosalie sat at breakfast before unchanging\nboiled eggs, unfailing toast and unalterable broiled bacon, morning\nafter morning. Sir Nigel sat and munched over the newspapers, his\nmother, with an air of relentless disapproval from a lofty height of\nboth her food and companions, disposed of her eggs and her rasher at\nRosalie's right hand. She had transferred to her daughter-in-law her\npreviously occupied seat at the head of the table. This had been\ndone with a carefully prepared scene of intense though correct\ndisagreeableness, in which she had managed to convey all the rancour of\nher dethroned spirit and her disapproval and disdain of international\nalliances.\n\n\"It is of course proper that you should sit at the head of your\nhusband's table,\" she had said, among other agreeable things. \"A woman\nhaving devoted her life to her son must relinquish her position to the\nperson he chooses to marry. If you should have a son you will give\nup your position to his wife. Since Nigel has married you, he has, of\ncourse, a right to expect that you will at least make an effort to learn\nsomething of what is required of women of your position.\"\n\n\"Sit down, Rosalie,\" said Nigel. \"Of course you take the head of the\ntable, and naturally you must learn what is expected of my wife, but\ndon't talk confounded rubbish, mother, about devoting your life to your\nson. We have seen about as little of each other as we could help. We\nnever agreed.\" They were both bullies and each made occasional efforts\nat bullying the other without any particular result. But each could at\nleast bully the other into intensified unpleasantness.\n\nThe vicar's wife having made her call of ceremony upon the new\nLady Anstruthers, followed up the acquaintance, and found her quite\nexotically unlike her mother-in-law, whose charities one may be sure had\nneither been lavish nor dispensed by any hand less impressive than her\nown. The younger woman was of wholly malleable material. Her sympathies\nwere easily awakened and her purse was well filled and readily opened.\nSmall families or large ones, newly born infants or newly buried ones,\nold women with \"bad legs\" and old men who needed comforts, equally\ntouched her heart. She innocently bestowed sovereigns where an\nEnglishwoman would have known that half-crowns would have been\nsufficient. As the vicaress was her almoner that lady felt her\nimportance rapidly on the increase. When she left a cottage saying,\n\"I'll speak to young Lady Anstruthers about you,\" the good woman of the\nhouse curtsied low and her husband touched his forehead respectfully.\n\nBut this did not advance the fortunes of Sir Nigel, who personally\nrequired of her very different things. Two weeks after her arrival at\nStornham, Rosalie began to see that somehow she was regarded as a person\nalmost impudently in the wrong. It appeared that if she had been an\nEnglish girl she would have been quite different, that she would have\nbeen an advantage instead of a detriment. As an American she was a\ndetriment. That seemed to go without saying. She tried to do everything\nshe was told, and learn something from each cold insinuation. She did\nnot know that her very amenability and timidity were her undoing. Sir\nNigel and his mother thoroughly enjoyed themselves at her expense. They\nknew they could say anything they chose, and that at the most she would\nonly break down into crying and afterwards apologise for being so badly\nbehaved. If some practical, strong-minded person had been near to defend\nher she might have been rescued promptly and her tyrants routed. But she\nwas a young girl, tender of heart and weak of nature. She used to cry a\ngreat deal when she was alone, and when she wrote to her mother she was\ntoo frightened to tell the truth concerning her unhappiness.\n\n\"Oh, if I could just see some of them!\" she would wail to herself. \"If\nI could just see mother or father or anybody from New York! Oh, I know\nI shall never see New York again, or Broadway or Fifth Avenue or Central\nPark--I never--never--never shall!\" And she would grovel among her\npillows, burying her face and half stifling herself lest her sobs should\nbe heard. Her feeling for her husband had become one of terror and\nrepulsion. She was almost more afraid of his patronising, affectionate\nmoments than she was of his temper.\n\nHis conjugal condescensions made her feel vaguely--without knowing\nwhy--as if she were some lower order of little animal.\n\nAmerican women, he said, had no conception of wifely duties and\naffection. He had a great deal to say on the subject of wifely duty.\nIt was part of her duty as a wife to be entirely satisfied with his\nsociety, and to be completely happy in the pleasure it afforded her. It\nwas her wifely duty not to talk about her own family and palpitatingly\nexpect letters by every American mail. He objected intensely to this\nletter writing and receiving, and his mother shared his prejudices.\n\n\"You have married an Englishman,\" her ladyship said. \"You have put it\nout of his power to marry an Englishwoman, and the least consideration\nyou can show is to let New York and Nine-hundredth street remain upon\nthe other side of the Atlantic and not insist on dragging them into\nStornham Court.\"\n\nThe Dowager Lady Anstruthers was very fine in her picture of her mental\ncondition, when she realised, as she seemed periodically to do, that it\nwas no longer possible for her son to make a respectable marriage with\na woman of his own nation. The unadorned fact was that both she and\nSir Nigel were infuriated by the simplicity which made Rosalie slow in\ncomprehending that it was proper that the money her father allowed\nher should be placed in her husband's hands, and left there with no\nindelicate questioning. If she had been an English girl matters would\nhave been made plain to her from the first and arranged satisfactorily\nbefore her marriage. Sir Nigel's mother considered that he had played\nthe fool, and would not believe that New York fathers were such touchy,\nsentimental idiots as not to know what was expected of them.\n\nThey wasted no time, however, in coming to the point, and in a measure\nit was the vicaress who aided them. Not she entirely, however.\n\nSince her mother-in-law's first mention of a possible son whose wife\nwould eventually thrust her from her seat at the head of the table,\nRosalie had several times heard this son referred to. It struck her\nthat in England such things seemed discussed with more freedom than in\nAmerica. She had never heard a young woman's possible family arranged\nfor and made the subject of conversation in the more crude atmosphere\nof New York. It made her feel rather awkward at first. Then she began\nto realise that the son was part of her wifely duty also; that she was\nexpected to provide one, and that he was in some way expected to provide\nfor the estate--to rehabilitate it--and that this was because her\nfather, being a rich man, would provide for him. It had also struck her\nthat in England there was a tendency to expectation that someone\nwould \"provide\" for someone else, that relatives even by marriage were\nsupposed to \"make allowances\" on which it was quite proper for other\npersons to live. Rosalie had been accustomed to a community in which\neven rich men worked, and in which young and able-bodied men would have\nfelt rather indignant if aunts or uncles had thought it necessary to\npension them off as if they had been impotent paupers. It was Rosalie's\nson who was to be \"provided for\" in this case, and who was to \"provide\nfor\" his father.\n\n\"When you have a son,\" her mother-in-law had remarked severely, \"I\nsuppose something will be done for Nigel and the estate.\"\n\nThis had been said before she had been ten days in the house, and had\nset her not-too-quick brain working. She had already begun to see that\nlife at Stornham Court was not the luxurious affair it was in the\nhouse in Fifth Avenue. Things were shabby and queer and not at all\ncomfortable. Fires were not lighted because a day was chilly and gloomy.\nShe had once asked for one in her bedroom and her mother-in-law had\nreproved her for indecent extravagance in a manner which took her breath\naway.\n\n\"I suppose in America you have your house at furnace heat in July,\" she\nsaid. \"Mere wastefulness and self-indulgence! That is why Americans are\nold women at twenty. They are shrivelled and withered by the unhealthy\nlives they lead. Stuffing themselves with sweets and hot bread and never\nbreathing the fresh air.\"\n\nRosalie could not at the moment recall any withered and shrivelled old\nwomen of twenty, but she blushed and stammered as usual.\n\n\"It is never cold enough for fires in July,\" she answered, \"but we--we\nnever think fires extravagant when we are not comfortable without them.\"\n\n\"Coal must be cheaper than it is in England,\" said her ladyship. \"When\nyou have a daughter, I hope you do not expect to bring her up as girls\nare brought up in New York.\"\n\nThis was the first time Rosalie had heard of her daughter, and she was\nnot ready enough to reply. She naturally went into her room and cried\nagain, wondering what her father and mother would say if they knew that\nbedroom fires were considered vulgarly extravagant by an impressive\nmember of the British aristocracy.\n\nShe was not at all strong at the time and was given to feeling chilly\nand miserable on wet, windy days. She used to cry more than ever and was\nso desolate that there were days when she used to go to the vicarage for\ncompanionship. On such days the vicar's wife would entertain her with\nstories of the villagers' catastrophes, and she would empty her purse\nupon the tea table and feel a little consoled because she was the means\nof consoling someone else.\n\n\"I suppose it gratifies your vanity to play the Lady Bountiful,\" Sir\nNigel sneered one evening, having heard in the village what she was\ndoing.\n\n\"I--never thought of such a thing,\" she stammered feebly. \"Mrs. Brent\nsaid they were so poor.\"\n\n\"You throw your money about as if you were a child,\" said her\nmother-in-law. \"It is a pity it is not put in the hands of some person\nwith discretion.\"\n\nIt had begun to dawn upon Rosalie that her ladyship was deeply convinced\nthat either herself or her son would be admirably discreet custodians of\nthe money referred to. And even the dawning of this idea had frightened\nthe girl. She was so inexperienced and ignorant that she felt it might\nbe possible that in England one's husband and one's mother-in-law could\ndo what they liked. It might be that they could take possession of one's\nmoney as they seemed to take possession of one's self and one's very\nsoul. She would have been very glad to give them money, and had indeed\nwondered frequently if she might dare to offer it to them, if they would\nbe outraged and insulted and slay her in their wrath at her purse-proud\ndaring. She had tried to invent ways in which she could approach the\nsubject, but had not been able to screw up her courage to any sticking\npoint. She was so overpowered by her consciousness that they seemed\ncontinually to intimate that Americans with money were ostentatious and\nalways laying stress upon the amount of their possessions. She had no\nconception of the primeval simpleness of their attitude in such matters,\nand that no ceremonies were necessary save the process of transferring\nsufficiently large sums as though they were the mere right of the\nrecipients. She was taught to understand this later. In the meantime,\nhowever, ready as she would have been to give large sums if she had\nknown how, she was terrified by the thought that it might be possible\nthat she could be deprived of her bank account and reduced to the\ncondition of a sort of dependent upon the humours of her lately acquired\nrelations. She thought over this a good deal, and would have found\nimmense relief if she dared have consulted anyone. But she could not\nmake up her mind to reveal her unhappiness to her people. She had been\nmarried so recently, everybody had thought her marriage so delightful,\nshe could not bear that her father and mother should be distressed by\nknowing that she was wretched. She also reflected with misery that\nNew York would talk the matter over excitedly and that finally the\nnewspapers would get hold of the gossip. She could even imagine\ninterviewers calling at the house in Fifth Avenue and endeavouring\nto obtain particulars of the situation. Her father would be angry and\nrefuse to give them, but that would make no difference; the newspapers\nwould give them and everybody would read what they said, whether it was\ntrue or not. She could not possibly write facts, she thought, so her\npoor little letters were restrained and unlike herself, and to the\nwarm-hearted souls in New York, even appearing stiff and unaffectionate,\nas if her aristocratic surroundings had chilled her love for them. In\nfact, it became far from easy for her to write at all, since Sir Nigel\nso disapproved of her interest in the American mail. His objections had\nindeed taken the form of his feeling himself quite within his rights\nwhen he occasionally intercepted letters from her relations, with a view\nof finding out whether they contained criticisms of himself, which would\nbetray that she had been guilty of indiscreet confidences. He discovered\nthat she had not apparently been so guilty, but it was evident that\nthere were moments when Mrs. Vanderpoel was uneasy and disposed to ask\nanxious questions. When this occurred he destroyed the letters, and as a\nresult of this precaution on his part her motherly queries seemed to be\nignored, and she several times shed tears in the belief that Rosy had\ngrown so patrician that she was capable of snubbing her mother in\nher resentment at feeling her privacy intruded upon and an unrefined\neffusiveness shown.\n\n\"I just feel as if she was beginning not to care about us at all,\nBetty,\" she said. \"I couldn't have believed it of Rosy. She was always\nsuch an affectionate girl.\"\n\n\"I don't believe it now,\" replied Betty sharply. \"Rosy couldn't grow\nhateful and stuck up. It's that nasty Nigel I know it is.\"\n\nSir Nigel's intention was that there should be as little intercourse\nbetween Fifth Avenue and Stornham Court as was possible. Among other\nthings, he did not intend that a lot of American relations should come\ntumbling in when they chose to cross the Atlantic. He would not have it,\nand took discreet steps to prevent any accident of the sort. He wrote\nto America occasionally himself, and knowing well how to make himself\ncivilly repellent, so subtly chilled his parents-in-law as to discourage\nin them more than once their half-formed plan of paying a visit to their\nchild in her new home. He opened, read and reclosed all epistles to\nand from New York, and while Mrs. Vanderpoel was much hurt to find\nthat Rosalie never condescended to make any response to her tentatives\nconcerning her possible visit, Rosalie herself was mystified by the fact\nthat the journey \"to Europe\" was never spoken of.\n\n\"I don't see why they never seem to think of coming over,\" she said\nplaintively one day. \"They used to talk so much about it.\"\n\n\"They?\" ejaculated the Dowager Lady Anstruthers. \"Whom may you mean?\"\n\n\"Mother and father and Betty and some of the others.\"\n\nHer mother-in-law put up her eye-glasses to stare at her.\n\n\"The whole family?\" she inquired.\n\n\"There are not so many of them,\" Rosalie answered.\n\n\"A family is always too many to descend upon a young woman when she is\nmarried,\" observed her ladyship unmovedly. Nigel glanced over the top of\nhis Times.\n\n\"I may as well tell you that it would not do at all,\" he put in.\n\n\"Why--why not?\" exclaimed Rosalie, aghast.\n\n\"Americans don't do in English society,\" slightingly.\n\n\"But they are coming over so much. They like London so--all Americans\nlike London.\"\n\n\"Do they?\" with a drawl which made Rosalie blush until the tears started\nto her eyes. \"I am afraid the sentiment is scarcely mutual.\"\n\nRosalie turned and fled from the room. She turned and fled because she\nrealised that she should burst out crying if she waited to hear another\nword, and she realised that of late she seemed always to be bursting out\ncrying before one or the other of those two. She could not help it. They\nalways seemed to be implying something slighting or scathing. They were\nalways putting her in the wrong and hurting her feelings.\n\nThe day was damp and chill, but she put on her hat and ran out into the\npark. She went down the avenue and turned into a coppice. There, among\nthe wet bracken, she sank down on the mossy trunk of a fallen tree and\nhuddled herself in a small heap, her head on her arms, actually wailing.\n\n\"Oh, mother! Oh, mother!\" she cried hysterically. \"Oh, I do wish you\nwould come. I'm so cold, mother; I'm so ill! I can't bear it! It seems\nas if you'd forgotten all about me! You're all so happy in New York that\nperhaps you have forgotten--perhaps you have! Oh, don't, mother--don't!\"\n\nIt was a month later that through the vicar's wife she reached a\ndiscovery and a climax. She had heard one morning from this lady of a\nmisfortune which had befallen a small farmer. It was a misfortune which\nwas an actual catastrophe to a man in his position. His house had caught\nfire during a gale of wind and the fire had spread to the outbuildings\nand rickyard and swept away all his belongings, his house, his\nfurniture, his hayricks, and stored grain, and even his few cows and\nhorses. He had been a poor, hard-working fellow, and his small insurance\nhad lapsed the day before the fire. He was absolutely ruined, and\nwith his wife and six children stood face to face with beggary and\nstarvation.\n\nRosalie Anstruthers entered the vicarage to find the poor woman who was\nhis companion in calamity sobbing in the hall. A child of a few weeks\nwas in her arms, and two small creatures clung crying to her skirts.\n\n\"We've worked hard,\" she wept; \"we have, ma'am. Father, he's always been\nsteady, an' up early an' late. P'r'aps it's the Lord's 'and, as you\nsay, ma'am, but we've been decent people an' never missed church when we\ncould 'elp it--father didn't deserve it--that he didn't.\"\n\nShe was heartbroken in her downtrodden hopelessness. Rosalie literally\nquaked with sympathy. She poured forth her pity in such words as the\npoor woman had never heard spoken by a great lady to a humble creature\nlike herself. The villagers found the new Lady Anstruthers' interviews\nwith them curiously simple and suggestive of an equality they could\nnot understand. Stornham was a conservative old village, where the\ndistinction between the gentry and the peasants was clearly marked. The\ncottagers were puzzled by Sir Nigel's wife, but they decided that she\nwas kind, if unusual.\n\nAs Rosalie talked to the farmer's wife she longed for her father's\npresence. She had remembered a time when a man in his employ had lost\nhis all by fire, the small house he had just made his last payment upon\nhaving been burned to the ground. He had lost one of his children in\nthe fire, and the details had been heartrending. The entire Vanderpoel\nhousehold had wept on hearing them, and Mr. Vanderpoel had drawn a\ncheque which had seemed like a fortune to the sufferer. A new house\nhad been bought, and Mrs. Vanderpoel and her daughters and friends had\nbestowed furniture and clothing enough to make the family comfortable to\nthe verge of luxury.\n\n\"See, you poor thing,\" said Rosalie, glowing with memories of this\nincident, her homesick young soul comforted by the mere likeness in the\ntwo calamities. \"I brought my cheque book with me because I meant to\nhelp you. A man worked for my father had his house burned, just as yours\nwas, and my father made everything all right for him again. I'll make it\nall right for you; I'll make you a cheque for a hundred pounds now, and\nthen when your husband begins to build I'll give him some more.\"\n\nThe woman gasped for breath and turned pale. She was frightened. It\nreally seemed as if her ladyship must have lost her wits a little. She\ncould not mean this. The vicaress turned pale also.\n\n\"Lady Anstruthers,\" she said, \"Lady Anstruthers, it--it is too much. Sir\nNigel----\"\n\n\"Too much!\" exclaimed Rosalie. \"They have lost everything, you know;\ntheir hayricks and cattle as well as their house; I guess it won't be\nhalf enough.\"\n\nMrs. Brent dragged her into the vicar's study and talked to her. She\ntried to explain that in English villages such things were not done in\na manner so casual, as if they were the mere result of unconsidered\nfeeling, as if they were quite natural things, such as any human person\nmight do. When Rosalie cried: \"But why not--why not? They ought to be.\"\nMrs. Brent could not seem to make herself quite clear. Rosalie only\ngathered in a bewildered way that there ought to be more ceremony, more\ndeliberation, more holding off, before a person of rank indulged in\nsuch munificence. The recipient ought to be made to feel it more, to\nunderstand fully what a great thing was being done.\n\n\"They will think you will do anything for them.\"\n\n\"So I will,\" said young Lady Anstruthers, \"if I have the money when they\nare in such awful trouble. Suppose we lost everything in the world and\nthere were people who could easily help us and wouldn't?\"\n\n\"You and Sir Nigel--that is quite different,\" said Mrs. Brent. \"I am\nafraid that if you do not discuss the matter and ask advice from your\nhusband and mother-in-law they will be very much offended.\"\n\n\"If I were doing it with their money they would have the right to be,\"\nreplied Rosalie, with entire ingenuousness. \"I wouldn't presume to do\nsuch a thing as that. That wouldn't be right, of course.\"\n\n\"They will be angry with me,\" said the vicaress awkwardly. This queer,\nsilly girl, who seemed to see nothing in the right light, frequently\nmade her feel awkward. Mrs. Brent told her husband that she appeared to\nhave no sense of dignity or proper appreciation of her position.\n\nThe wife of the farmer, John Wilson, carried away the cheque, quite\nstunned. She was breathless with amazement and turned rather faint with\nexcitement, bewilderment and her sense of relief. She had to sit down\nin the vicarage kitchen for a few minutes and drink a glass of the thin\nvicarage beer.\n\nRosalie promised that she would discuss the matter and ask advice\nwhen she returned to the Court. Just as she left the house Mrs. Brent\nsuddenly remembered something she had forgotten.\n\n\"The Wilson trouble completely drove it out of my mind,\" she said. \"It\nwas a stupid mistake of the postboy's. He left a letter of yours among\nmine when he came this morning. It was most careless. I shall speak\nto his father about it. It might have been important that you should\nreceive it early.\"\n\nWhen she saw the letter Rosalie uttered an exclamation. It was addressed\nin her father's handwriting.\n\n\"Oh!\" she cried. \"It's from father! And the postmark is Havre. What does\nit mean?\"\n\nShe was so excited that she almost forgot to express her thanks.\nHer heart leaped up in her throat. Could they have come over from\nAmerica--could they? Why was it written from Havre? Could they be near\nher?\n\nShe walked along the road choked with ecstatic, laughing sobs. Her hand\nshook so that she could scarcely tear open the envelope; she tore a\ncorner of the letter, and when the sheet was spread open her eyes were\nfull of wild, delighted tears, which made it impossible for her to see\nfor the moment. But she swept the tears away and read this:\n\n\nDEAR DAUGHTER:\n\nIt seems as if we had had pretty bad luck in not seeing you. We had\ncounted on it very much, and your mother feels it all the more because\nshe is weak after her illness. We don't quite understand why you did\nnot seem to know about her having had diphtheria in Paris. You did not\nanswer Betty's letter. Perhaps it missed you in some way. Things do\nsometimes go wrong in the mail, and several times your mother has\nthought a letter has been lost. She thought so because you seemed to\nforget to refer to things. We came over to leave Betty at a French\nschool and we had expected to visit you later. But your mother fell ill\nof diphtheria and not hearing from you seemed to make her homesick,\nso we decided to return to New York by the next steamer. I ran over to\nLondon, however, to make some inquiries about you, and on the first day\nI arrived I met your husband in Bond Street. He at once explained to me\nthat you had gone to a house party at some castle in Scotland, and said\nyou were well and enjoying yourself very much, and he was on his way to\njoin you. I am sorry, daughter, that it has turned out that we could not\nsee each other. It seems a long time since you left us. But I am very\nglad, however, that you are so well and really like English life. If we\nhad time for it I am sure it would be delightful. Your mother sends\nher love and wants very much to hear of all you are doing and enjoying.\nHoping that we may have better luck the next time we cross--\n\nYour affectionate father,\n\nREUBEN L. VANDERPOEL.\n\n\nRosalie found herself running breathlessly up the avenue. She was\nclutching the letter still in her hand, and staggering from side to\nside. Now and then she uttered horrible little short cries, like an\nanimal's. She ran and ran, seeing nothing, and now and then with the\nclenched hand in which the letter was crushed striking a sharp blow at\nher breast.\n\nShe stumbled up the big stone steps she had mounted on the day she was\nbrought home as a bride. Her dress caught her feet and she fell on her\nknees and scrambled up again, gasping; she dashed across the huge\ndark hall, and, hurling herself against the door of the morning room,\nappeared, dishevelled, haggard-eyed, and with scarlet patches on her\nwild, white face, before the Dowager, who started angrily to her feet:\n\n\"Where is Nigel? Where is Nigel?\" she cried out frenziedly.\n\n\"What in heaven's name do you mean by such manners?\" demanded her\nladyship. \"Apologise at once!\"\n\n\"Where is Nigel? Nigel! Nigel!\" the girl raved. \"I will see him--I\nwill--I will see him!\"\n\nShe who had been the mildest of sweet-tempered creatures all her life\nhad suddenly gone almost insane with heartbroken, hysteric grief and\nrage. She did not know what she was saying and doing; she only realised\nin an agony of despair that she was a thing caught in a trap; that these\npeople had her in their power, and that they had tricked and lied to her\nand kept her apart from what her girl's heart so cried out to and longed\nfor. Her father, her mother, her little sister; they had been near her\nand had been lied to and sent away.\n\n\"You are quite mad, you violent, uncontrolled creature!\" cried the\nDowager furiously. \"You ought to be put in a straitjacket and drenched\nwith cold water.\"\n\nThen the door opened again and Nigel strode in. He was in riding dress\nand was breathless and livid with anger. He was in a nice mood to\nconfront a wife on the verge of screaming hysterics. After a bad half\nhour with his steward, who had been talking of impending disasters,\nhe had heard by chance of Wilson's conflagration and the hundred-pound\ncheque. He had galloped home at the top of his horse's speed.\n\n\"Here is your wife raving mad,\" cried out his mother.\n\nRosalie staggered across the room to him. She held up her hand clenching\nthe letter and shook it at him.\n\n\"My mother and father have been here,\" she shrieked. My mother has been\nill. They wanted to come to see me. You knew and you kept it from me.\nYou told my father lies--lies--hideous lies! You said I was away in\nScotland--enjoying myself--when I was here and dying with homesickness.\nYou made them think I did not care for them--or for New York! You have\nkilled me! Why did you do such a wicked thing!\n\nHe looked at her with glaring eyes. If a man born a gentleman is ever in\nthe mood to kick his wife to death, as costermongers do, he was in that\nmood. He had lost control over himself as completely as she had, and\nwhile she was only a desperate, hysteric girl, he was a violent man.\n\n\"I did it because I did not mean to have them here,\" he said. \"I did it\nbecause I won't have them here.\"\n\n\"They shall come,\" she quavered shrilly in her wildness. \"They shall\ncome to see me. They are my own father and mother, and I will have\nthem.\"\n\nHe caught her arm in such a grip that she must have thought he would\nbreak it, if she could have thought or felt anything.\n\n\"No, you will not have them,\" he ground forth between his teeth. \"You\nwill do as I order you and learn to behave yourself as a decent married\nwoman should. You will learn to obey your husband and respect his wishes\nand control your devilish American temper.\"\n\n\"They have gone--gone!\" wailed Rosalie. \"You sent them away! My father,\nmy mother, my sister!\"\n\n\"Stop your indecent ravings!\" ordered Sir Nigel, shaking her. \"I will\nnot submit to be disgraced before the servants.\"\n\n\"Put your hand over her mouth, Nigel,\" cried his mother. \"The very\nscullery maids will hear.\"\n\nShe was as infuriated as her son. And, indeed, to behold civilised human\nbeings in the state of uncontrolled violence these three had reached was\na sight to shudder at.\n\n\"I won't stop,\" cried the girl. \"Why did you take me away from\neverything--I was quite happy. Everybody was kind to me. I loved people,\nI had everything. No one ever--ever--ever ill-used anyone----\"\n\nSir Nigel clutched her arm more brutally still and shook her with\nabsolute violence. Her hair broke loose and fell about her awful little\ndistorted, sobbing face.\n\n\"I did not take you to give you an opportunity to display your vulgar\nostentation by throwing away hundred-pound cheques to villagers,\" he\nsaid. \"I didn't take you to give you the position of a lady and be made\na fool of by you.\"\n\n\"You have ruined him,\" burst forth his mother. \"You have put it out of\nhis power to marry an Englishwoman who would have known it was her duty\nto give something in return for his name and protection.\"\n\nHer ladyship had begun to rave also, and as mother and son were of equal\nviolence when they had ceased to control themselves, Rosalie began to\nfind herself enlightened unsparingly. She and her people were vulgar\nsharpers. They had trapped a gentleman into a low American marriage and\nhad not the decency to pay for what they had got. If she had been an\nEnglishwoman, well born, and of decent breeding, all her fortune would\nhave been properly transferred to her husband and he would have had the\ndispensing of it. Her husband would have been in the position to control\nher expenditure and see that she did not make a fool of herself. As it\nwas she was the derision of all decent people, of all people who had\nbeen properly brought up and knew what was in good taste and of good\nmorality.\n\nFirst it was the Dowager who poured forth, and then it was Sir\nNigel. They broke in on each other, they interrupted one another with\nexclamations and interpolations. They had so far lost themselves that\nthey did not know they became grotesque in the violence of their fury.\nRosalie's brain whirled. Her hysteria mounted and mounted. She stared\nfirst at one and then at the other, gasping and sobbing by turns; she\nswayed on her feet and clutched at a chair.\n\n\"I did not know,\" she broke forth at last, trying to make her voice\nheard in the storm. \"I never understood. I knew something made you\nhate me, but I didn't know you were angry about money.\" She laughed\ntremulously and wildly. \"I would have given it to you--father would have\ngiven you some--if you had been good to me.\" The laugh became hysterical\nbeyond her management. Peal after peal broke from her, she shook all\nover with her ghastly merriment, sobbing at one and the same time.\n\n\"Oh! oh! oh!\" she shrieked. \"You see, I thought you were so\naristocratic. I wouldn't have dared to think of such a thing. I thought\nan English gentleman--an English gentleman--oh! oh! to think it was\nall because I did not give you money--just common dollars and cents\nthat--that I daren't offer to a decent American who could work for\nhimself.\"\n\nSir Nigel sprang at her. He struck her with his open hand upon the\ncheek, and as she reeled she held up her small, feverish, shaking hand,\nlaughing more wildly than before.\n\n\"You ought not to strike me,\" she cried. \"You oughtn't! You don't know\nhow valuable I am. Perhaps----\" with a little, crazy scream--\"perhaps I\nmight have a son.\"\n\nShe fell in a shuddering heap, and as she dropped she struck heavily\nagainst the protruding end of an oak chest and lay upon the floor, her\narms flung out and limp, as if she were a dead thing.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nON BOTH SIDES OF THE ATLANTIC\n\nIn the course of twelve years the Shuttle had woven steadily and--its\nmovements lubricated by time and custom--with increasing rapidity.\nThreads of commerce it caught up and shot to and fro, with threads of\nliterature and art, threads of life drawn from one shore to the other\nand back again, until they were bound in the fabric of its weaving.\nColdness there had been between both lands, broad divergence of taste\nand thought, argument across seas, sometimes resentment, but the web in\nFate's hands broadened and strengthened and held fast. Coldness faintly\nwarmed despite itself, taste and thought drawn into nearer contact,\nreflecting upon their divergences, grew into tolerance and the knowledge\nthat the diverging, seen more clearly, was not so broad; argument\ncoming within speaking distance reasoned itself to logical and practical\nconclusions. Problems which had stirred anger began to find solutions.\nBooks, in the first place, did perhaps more than all else. Cheap,\npirated editions of English works, much quarrelled over by authors and\npublishers, being scattered over the land, brought before American eyes\nsoft, home-like pictures of places which were, after all was said and\ndone, the homes of those who read of them, at least in the sense of\nhaving been the birthplaces of fathers or grandfathers. Some subtle,\nfar-reaching power of nature caused a stirring of the blood, a vague,\nunexpressed yearning and lingering over pages which depicted sweet,\ngreen lanes, broad acres rich with centuries of nourishment and care;\ngrey church towers, red roofs, and village children playing before\ncottage doors. None of these things were new to those who pondered over\nthem, kinsmen had dwelt on memories of them in their fireside talk,\nand their children had seen them in fancy and in dreams. Old grievances\nhaving had time to fade away and take on less poignant colour, the\nstirring of the blood stirred also imaginations, and wakened something\nakin to homesickness, though no man called the feeling by its name. And\nthis, perhaps, was the strongest cord the Shuttle wove and was the true\nmeaning of its power. Being drawn by it, Americans in increasing numbers\nturned their faces towards the older land. Gradually it was discovered\nthat it was the simplest affair in the world to drive down to the\nwharves and take a steamer which landed one, after a more or less\ninteresting voyage, in Liverpool, or at some other convenient port.\nFrom there one went to London, or Paris, or Rome; in fact, whithersoever\none's fancy guided, but first or last it always led the traveller to\nthe treading of green, velvet English turf. And once standing on\nsuch velvet, both men and women, looking about them, felt, despite\nthemselves, the strange old thrill which some of them half resented and\nsome warmly loved.\n\nIn the course of twelve years, a length of time which will transform a\nlittle girl wearing a short frock into a young woman wearing a long one,\nthe pace of life and the ordering of society may become so altered as\nto appear amazing when one finds time to reflect on the subject. But one\ndoes not often find time. Changes occur so gradually that one scarcely\nobserves them, or so swiftly that they take the form of a kind of amazed\nshock which one gets over as quickly as one experiences it and realises\nthat its cause is already a fixed fact.\n\nIn the United States of America, which have not yet acquired the serene\nsense of conservative self-satisfaction and repose which centuries of\nage may bestow, the spirit of life itself is the aspiration for change.\nAmbition itself only means the insistence on change. Each day is to be\nbetter than yesterday fuller of plans, of briskness, of initiative. Each\nto-day demands of to-morrow new men, new minds, new work. A to-day which\nhas not launched new ships, explored new countries, constructed new\nbuildings, added stories to old ones, may consider itself a failure,\nunworthy even of being consigned to the limbo of respectable yesterdays.\nSuch a country lives by leaps and bounds, and the ten years which\nfollowed the marriage of Reuben Vanderpoel's eldest daughter made many\nsuch bounds and leaps. They were years which initiated and established\ninternational social relations in a manner which caused them to\nincorporate themselves with the history of both countries. As America\ndiscovered Europe, that continent discovered America. American beauties\nbegan to appear in English drawing-rooms and Continental salons. They\nwere presented at court and commented upon in the Row and the Bois.\nTheir little transatlantic tricks of speech and their mots were repeated\nwith gusto. It became understood that they were amusing and amazing.\nAmericans \"came in\" as the heroes and heroines of novels and stories.\nPunch delighted in them vastly. Shopkeepers and hotel proprietors\nstocked, furnished, and provisioned for them. They spent money\nenormously and were singularly indifferent (at the outset) under\nimposition. They \"came over\" in a manner as epoch-making, though less\nwar-like than that of William the Conqueror.\n\nInternational marriages ceased to be a novelty. As Bettina Vanderpoel\ngrew up, she grew up, so to speak, in the midst of them. She saw her\ncountry, its people, its newspapers, its literature, innocently rejoiced\nby the alliances its charming young women contracted with foreign\nrank. She saw it affectionately, gleefully, rubbing its hands over its\nduchesses, its countesses, its miladies. The American Eagle spread its\nwings and flapped them sometimes a trifle, over this new but so natural\nand inevitable triumph of its virgins. It was of course only \"American\"\nthat such things should happen. America ruled the universe, and its\nwomen ruled America, bullying it a little, prettily, perhaps. What could\nbe more a matter of course than that American women, being aided by\nadoring fathers, brothers and husbands, sumptuously to ship themselves\nto other lands, should begin to rule these lands also? Betty, in her\ngrowing up, heard all this intimated. At twelve years old, though she\nhad detested Rosalie's marriage, she had rather liked to hear people\ntalk of the picturesqueness of places like Stornham Court, and of the\nlife led by women of rank in their houses in town and country. Such\ntalk nearly always involved the description of things and people, whose\ncolour and tone had only reached her through the medium of books, most\nfrequently fiction.\n\nShe was, however, of an unusually observing mind, even as a child, and\nthe time came when she realised that the national bird spread its wings\nless proudly when the subject of international matches was touched upon,\nand even at such times showed signs of restlessness. Now and then things\nhad not turned out as they appeared to promise; two or three seemingly\nbrilliant unions had resulted in disaster. She had not understood all\nthe details the newspapers cheerfully provided, but it was clear to\nher that more than one previously envied young woman had had practical\nreasons for discovering that she had made an astonishingly bad bargain.\nThis being the case, she used frequently to ponder over the case of\nRosy--Rosy! who had been swept away from them and swallowed up, as it\nseemed, by that other and older world. She was in certain ways a silent\nchild, and no one but herself knew how little she had forgotten Rosy,\nhow often she pondered over her, how sometimes she had lain awake in the\nnight and puzzled out lines of argument concerning her and things which\nmight be true.\n\nThe one grief of poor Mrs. Vanderpoel's life had been the apparent\nestrangement of her eldest child. After her first six months in England\nLady Anstruthers' letters had become fewer and farther between, and had\ngiven so little information connected with herself that affectionate\ncuriosity became discouraged. Sir Nigel's brief and rare epistles\nrevealed so little desire for any relationship with his wife's family\nthat gradually Rosy's image seemed to fade into far distance and become\nfainter with the passing of each month. It seemed almost an incredible\nthing, when they allowed themselves to think of it, but no member of the\nfamily had ever been to Stornham Court. Two or three efforts to arrange\na visit had been made, but on each occasion had failed through some\napparently accidental cause. Once Lady Anstruthers had been away, once\na letter had seemingly failed to reach her, once her children had had\nscarlet fever and the orders of the physicians in attendance had\nbeen stringent in regard to visitors, even relatives who did not fear\ncontagion.\n\n\"If she had been living in New York and her children had been ill I\nshould have been with her all the time,\" poor Mrs. Vanderpoel had said\nwith tears. \"Rosy's changed awfully, somehow. Her letters don't sound a\nbit like she used to be. It seems as if she just doesn't care to see her\nmother and father.\"\n\nBetty had frowned a good deal and thought intensely in secret. She did\nnot believe that Rosy was ashamed of her relations. She remembered,\nhowever, it is true, that Clara Newell (who had been a schoolmate) had\nbecome very super-fine and indifferent to her family after her marriage\nto an aristocratic and learned German. Hers had been one of the\nsuccessful alliances, and after living a few years in Berlin she had\nquite looked down upon New Yorkers, and had made herself exceedingly\nunpopular during her one brief visit to her relatives. She seemed\nto think her father and mother undignified and uncultivated, and she\ndisapproved entirely of her sisters dress and bearing. She said that\nthey had no distinction of manner and that all their interests were\nfrivolous and unenlightened.\n\n\"But Clara always was a conceited girl,\" thought Betty. \"She was always\npatronising people, and Rosy was only pretty and sweet. She always said\nherself that she had no brains. But she had a heart.\"\n\nAfter the lapse of a few years there had been no further discussion of\nplans for visiting Stornham. Rosalie had become so remote as to appear\nalmost unreachable. She had been presented at Court, she had had three\nchildren, the Dowager Lady Anstruthers had died. Once she had written\nto her father to ask for a large sum of money, which he had sent to\nher, because she seemed to want it very much. She required it to pay off\ncertain debts on the estate and spoke touchingly of her boy who would\ninherit.\n\n\"He is a delicate boy, father,\" she wrote, \"and I don't want the estate\nto come to him burdened.\"\n\nWhen she received the money she wrote gratefully of the generosity shown\nher, but she spoke very vaguely of the prospect of their seeing each\nother in the future. It was as if she felt her own remoteness even more\nthan they felt it themselves.\n\nIn the meantime Bettina had been taken to France and placed at school\nthere. The resulting experience was an enlightening one, far more\nilluminating to the quick-witted American child than it would have been\nto an English, French, or German one, who would not have had so much to\nlearn, and probably would not have been so quick at the learning.\n\nBetty Vanderpoel knew nothing which was not American, and only vaguely\na few things which were not of New York. She had lived in Fifth Avenue,\nattended school in a numbered street near her own home, played in and\nbeen driven round Central Park. She had spent the hot months of the\nsummer in places up the Hudson, or on Long Island, and such resorts of\npleasure. She had believed implicitly in all she saw and knew. She\nhad been surrounded by wealth and decent good nature throughout her\nexistence, and had enjoyed her life far too much to admit of any doubt\nthat America was the most perfect country in the world, Americans the\ncleverest and most amusing people, and that other nations were a little\nout of it, and consequently sufficiently scant of resource to render\npity without condemnation a natural sentiment in connection with one's\noccasional thoughts of them.\n\nBut hers was a mentality by no means ordinary. Inheritance in her nature\nhad combined with circumstances, as it has a habit of doing in all human\nbeings. But in her case the combinations were unusual and produced a\nresult somewhat remarkable. The quality of brains which, in the first\nReuben Vanderpoel had expressed itself in the marvellously successful\nplanning and carrying to their ends of commercial and financial schemes,\nthe absolute genius of penetration and calculation of the sordid and\nuneducated little trader in skins and barterer of goods, having\nfiltered through two generations of gradual education and refinement\nof existence, which was no longer that of the mere trader, had\nbeen transformed in the great-granddaughter into keen, clear sight,\nlevel-headed perceptiveness and a logical sense of values. As the first\nReuben had known by instinct the values of pelts and lands, Bettina\nknew by instinct the values of qualities, of brains, of hearts, of\ncircumstances, and the incidents which affect them. She was as unaware\nof the significance of her great possession as were those around her.\nNevertheless it was an unerring thing. As a mere child, unformed and\nuneducated by life, she had not been one of the small creatures to be\ndeceived or flattered.\n\n\"She's an awfully smart little thing, that Betty,\" her New York aunts\nand cousins often remarked. \"She seems to see what people mean, it\ndoesn't matter what they say. She likes people you would not expect her\nto like, and then again she sometimes doesn't care the least for people\nwho are thought awfully attractive.\"\n\nAs has been already intimated, the child was crude enough and not\nparticularly well bred, but her small brain had always been at work, and\neach day of her life recorded for her valuable impressions. The page of\nher young mind had ceased to be a blank much earlier than is usual.\n\nThe comparing of these impressions with such as she received when her\nlife in the French school was new afforded her active mental exercise.\n\nShe began with natural, secret indignation and rebellion. There was no\nother American pupil in the establishment besides herself. But for the\nfact that the name of Vanderpoel represented wealth so enormous as\nto amount to a sort of rank in itself, Bettina would not have been\nreceived. The proprietress of the institution had gravely disquieting\ndoubts of the propriety of America. Her pupils were not accustomed\nto freedom of opinions and customs. An American child might either\nconsciously or unconsciously introduce them. As this must be guarded\nagainst, Betty's first few months at the school were not agreeable to\nher. She was supervised and expurgated, as it were. Special Sisters\nwere told off to converse and walk with her, and she soon perceived\nthat conversations were not only French lessons in disguise, but were\nlectures on ethics, morals, and good manners, imperfectly concealed\nby the mask and domino of amiable entertainment. She translated into\nEnglish after the following manner the facts her swift young perceptions\ngathered. There were things it was so inelegant to say that only\nthe most impossible persons said them; there were things it was so\ninexcusable to do that when done their inexcusability assumed the\nproportions of a crime. There were movements, expressions, points of\nview, which one must avoid as one would avoid the plague. And they were\nall things, acts, expressions, attitudes of mind which Bettina had\nbeen familiar with from her infancy, and which she was well aware were\nconsidered almost entirely harmless and unobjectionable in New York,\nin her beloved New York, which was the centre of the world, which was\nbigger, richer, gayer, more admirable than any other city known upon the\nearth.\n\nIf she had not so loved it, if she had ever dreamed of the existence of\nany other place as being absolutely necessary, she would not have felt\nthe thing so bitterly. But it seemed to her that all these amiable\ndiatribes in exquisite French were directed at her New York, and it\nmust be admitted that she was humiliated and enraged. It was a personal,\nindeed, a family matter. Her father, her mother, her relatives, and\nfriends were all in some degree exactly the kind of persons whose\nspeech, habits, and opinions she must conscientiously avoid. But for\nthe instinct of summing up values, circumstances, and intentions, it is\nprobable that she would have lost her head, let loose her temper and her\ntongue, and have become insubordinate. But the quickness of perception\nwhich had revealed practical potentialities to old Reuben Vanderpoel,\nrevealed to her the value of French which was perfectly fluent, a voice\nwhich was musical, movements which were grace, manners which had a\nstill beauty, and comparing these things with others less charming\nshe listened and restrained herself, learning, marking, and inwardly\ndigesting with a cleverness most enviable.\n\nAmong her fellow pensionnaires she met with discomforting illuminations,\nwhich were fine discipline also, though if she herself had been a less\nintellectual creature they might have been embittering. Without doubt\nBetty, even at twelve years, was intellectual. Hers was the practical\nworking intellect which begins duty at birth and does not lay down its\ntools because the sun sets. The little and big girls who wrote their\nexercises at her side did not deliberately enlighten her, but she\nlearned from them in vague ways that it was not New York which was the\ncentre of the earth, but Paris, or Berlin, Madrid, London, or Rome.\nParis and London were perhaps more calmly positive of themselves than\nother capitals, and were a little inclined to smile at the lack of\nseriousness in other claims. But one strange fact was more predominant\nthan any other, and this was that New York was not counted as a\ncivilised centre at all; it had no particular existence. Nobody\nexpressed this rudely; in fact, it did not acquire the form of actual\nstatement at any time. It was merely revealed by amiable and ingenuous\nunconsciousness of the circumstance that such a part of the world\nexpected to be regarded or referred to at all. Betty began early to\nrealise that as her companions did not talk of Timbuctoo or Zanzibar,\nso they did not talk of New York. Stockholm or Amsterdam seemed,\ndespite their smallness, to be considered. No one denied the presence of\nZanzibar on the map, but as it conveyed nothing more than the impression\nof being a mere geographical fact, there was no reason why one should\ndwell on it in conversation. Remembering all she had left behind, the\ncrowded streets, the brilliant shop windows, the buzz of individual\npeople, there were moments when Betty ground her strong little teeth.\nShe wanted to express all these things, to call out, to explain, and\ncommand recognition for them. But her cleverness showed to her that\nargument or protestation would be useless. She could not make such\nhearers understand. There were girls whose interest in America was\nfounded on their impression that magnificent Indian chieftains in\nblankets and feathers stalked about the streets of the towns, and\nthat Betty's own thick black hair had been handed down to her by some\nbeautiful Minnehaha or Pocahontas. When first she was approached by\ntimid, tentative questionings revealing this point of view, Betty felt\nhot and answered with unamiable curtness. No, there were no red Indians\nin New York. There had been no red Indians in her family. She had\nneither grandmothers nor aunts who were squaws, if they meant that.\n\nShe felt so scornfully, so disgustedly indignant at their benighted\nignorance, that she knew she behaved very well in saying so little in\nreply. She could have said so much, but whatsoever she had said would\nhave conveyed nothing to them, so she thought it all out alone. She\nwent over the whole ground and little realised how much she was teaching\nherself as she turned and tossed in her narrow, spotlessly white bed at\nnight, arguing, comparing, drawing deductions from what she knew and\ndid not know of the two continents. Her childish anger, combining\nitself with the practical, alert brain of Reuben Vanderpoel the first,\ndeveloped in her a logical reasoning power which led her to arrive at\nmany an excellent and curiously mature conclusion. The result was\nfinely educational. All the more so that in her fevered desire for\njustification of the things she loved, she began to read books such as\nlittle girls do not usually take interest in. She found some difficulty\nin obtaining them at first, but a letter or two written to her father\nobtained for her permission to read what she chose. The third Reuben\nVanderpoel was deeply fond of his younger daughter, and felt in secret\na profound admiration for her, which was saved from becoming too obvious\nby the ever present American sense of humour.\n\n\"Betty seems to be going in for politics,\" he said after reading the\nletter containing her request and her first list of books. \"She's about\nas mad as she can be at the ignorance of the French girls about America\nand Americans. She wants to fill up on solid facts, so that she can come\nout strong in argument. She's got an understanding of the power of solid\nfacts that would be a fortune to her if she were a man.\"\n\nIt was no doubt her understanding of the power of facts which led her\nto learn everything well and to develop in many directions. She began to\ndip into political and historical volumes because she was furious, and\nwished to be able to refute idiocy, but she found herself continuing to\nread because she was interested in a way she had not expected. She began\nto see things. Once she made a remark which was prophetic. She made\nit in answer to a guileless observation concerning the gold mines with\nwhich Boston was supposed to be enriched.\n\n\"You don't know anything about America, you others,\" she said. \"But you\nWILL know!\"\n\n\"Do you think it will become the fashion to travel in America?\" asked a\nGerman girl.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Betty. \"But--it isn't so much that you will go to\nAmerica. I believe it will come to you. It's like that--America. It\ndoesn't stand still. It goes and gets what it wants.\"\n\nShe laughed as she ended, and so did the other girls. But in ten years'\ntime, when they were young women, some of them married, some of them\ncourt beauties, one of them recalled this speech to another, whom she\nencountered in an important house in St. Petersburg, the wife of the\ncelebrated diplomat who was its owner being an American woman.\n\nBettina Vanderpoel's education was a rather fine thing. She herself\nhad more to do with it than girls usually have to do with their own\ntraining. In a few months' time those in authority in the French school\nfound that it was not necessary to supervise and expurgate her. She\nlearned with an interested rapacity which was at once unusual and\namazing. And she evidently did not learn from books alone. Her voice, as\nan organ, had been musical and full from babyhood. It began to modulate\nitself and to express things most voices are incapable of expressing.\nShe had been so built by nature that the carriage of her head and limbs\nwas good to behold. She acquired a harmony of movement which caused her\nto lose no shade of grace and spirit. Her eyes were full of thought, of\nspeculation, and intentness.\n\n\"She thinks a great deal for one so young,\" was said of her frequently\nby one or the other of her teachers. One finally went further and added,\n\"She has genius.\"\n\nThis was true. She had genius, but it was not specialised. It was not\ngenius which expressed itself through any one art. It was a genius for\nlife, for living herself, for aiding others to live, for vivifying\nmere existence. She herself was, however, aware only of an eagerness\nof temperament, a passion for seeing, doing, and gaining knowledge.\nEverything interested her, everybody was suggestive and more or less\nenlightening.\n\nHer relatives thought her original in her fancies. They called them\nfancies because she was so young. Fortunately for her, there was no\nreason why she should not be gratified. Most girls preferred to spend\ntheir holidays on the Continent. She elected to return to America every\nalternate year. She enjoyed the voyage and she liked the entire change\nof atmosphere and people.\n\n\"It makes me like both places more,\" she said to her father when she was\nthirteen. \"It makes me see things.\"\n\nHer father discovered that she saw everything. She was the pleasure of\nhis life. He was attracted greatly by the interest she exhibited in\nall orders of things. He saw her make bold, ingenuous plunges into all\nwaters, without any apparent consciousness that the scraps of knowledge\nshe brought to the surface were unusual possessions for a schoolgirl.\nShe had young views on the politics and commerce of different countries,\nas she had views on their literature. When Reuben Vanderpoel swooped\nacross the American continent on journeys of thousands of miles, taking\nher as a companion, he discovered that he actually placed a sort of\nconfidence in her summing up of men and schemes. He took her to see\nmines and railroads and those who worked them, and he talked them over\nwith her afterward, half with a sense of humour, half with a sense of\nfinding comfort in her intelligent comprehension of all he said.\n\nShe enjoyed herself immensely and gained a strong picturesqueness of\ncharacter. After an American holiday she used to return to France,\nGermany, or Italy, with a renewed zest of feeling for all things\nromantic and antique. After a few years in the French convent she asked\nthat she might be sent to Germany.\n\n\"I am gradually changing into a French girl,\" she wrote to her father.\n\"One morning I found I was thinking it would be nice to go into a\nconvent, and another day I almost entirely agreed with one of the girls\nwho was declaiming against her brother who had fallen in love with a\nCalifornian. You had better take me away and send me to Germany.\"\n\nReuben Vanderpoel laughed. He understood Betty much better than most of\nher relations did. He knew when seriousness underlay her jests and his\nrespect for her seriousness was great. He sent her to school in Germany.\nDuring the early years of her schooldays Betty had observed that America\nappeared upon the whole to be regarded by her schoolfellows principally\nas a place to which the more unfortunate among the peasantry emigrated\nas steerage passengers when things could become no worse for them in\ntheir own country. The United States was not mentally detached from any\nother portion of the huge Western Continent. Quite well-educated persons\nspoke casually of individuals having \"gone to America,\" as if there were\nno particular difference between Brazil and Massachusetts.\n\n\"I wonder if you ever saw my cousin Gaston,\" a French girl once asked\nher as they sat at their desks. \"He became very poor through ill living.\nHe was quite without money and he went to America.\"\n\n\"To New York?\" inquired Bettina.\n\n\"I am not sure. The town is called Concepcion.\"\n\n\"That is not in the United States,\" Betty answered disdainfully. \"It is\nin Chili.\"\n\nShe dragged her atlas towards her and found the place.\n\n\"See,\" she said. \"It is thousands of miles from New York.\" Her companion\nwas a near-sighted, rather slow girl. She peered at the map, drawing a\nline with her finger from New York to Concepcion.\n\n\"Yes, they are at a great distance from one another,\" she admitted, \"but\nthey are both in America.\"\n\n\"But not both in the United States,\" cried Betty. \"French girls always\nseem to think that North and South America are the same, that they are\nboth the United States.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the slow girl with deliberation. \"We do make odd mistakes\nsometimes.\" To which she added with entire innocence of any ironic\nintention. \"But you Americans, you seem to feel the United States, your\nNew York, to be all America.\"\n\nBetty started a little and flushed. During a few minutes of rapid\nreflection she sat bolt upright at her desk and looked straight\nbefore her. Her mentality was of the order which is capable of making\ndiscoveries concerning itself as well as concerning others. She had\nnever thought of this view of the matter before, but it was quite true.\nTo passionate young patriots such as herself at least, that portion of\nthe map covered by the United States was America. She suddenly saw also\nthat to her New York had been America. Fifth Avenue Broadway, Central\nPark, even Tiffany's had been \"America.\" She laughed and reddened a\nshade as she put the atlas aside having recorded a new idea. She had\nfound out that it was not only Europeans who were local, which was a\ndiscovery of some importance to her fervid youth.\n\nBecause she thought so often of Rosalie, her attention was, during the\npassing years, naturally attracted by the many things she heard of such\nmarriages as were made by Americans with men of other countries than\ntheir own. She discovered that notwithstanding certain commercial\nviews of matrimony, all foreigners who united themselves with American\nheiresses were not the entire brutes primitive prejudice might lead\none to imagine. There were rather one-sided alliances which proved\nthemselves far from happy. The Cousin Gaston, for instance, brought home\na bride whose fortune rebuilt and refurnished his dilapidated chateau\nand who ended by making of him a well-behaved and cheery country\ngentleman not at all to be despised in his amiable, if light-minded good\nnature and good spirits. His wife, fortunately, was not a young woman\nwho yearned for sentiment. She was a nice-tempered, practical American\ngirl, who adored French country life and knew how to amuse and manage\nher husband. It was a genial sort of menage and yet though this was an\nundeniable fact, Bettina observed that when the union was spoken of it\nwas always referred to with a certain tone which conveyed that though\none did not exactly complain of its having been undesirable, it was\nnot quite what Gaston might have expected. His wife had money and was\ngood-natured, but there were limitations to one's appreciation of a\nmarriage in which husband and wife were not on the same plane.\n\n\"She is an excellent person, and it has been good for Gaston,\" said\nBettina's friend. \"We like her, but she is not--she is not----\" She\npaused there, evidently seeing that the remark was unlucky. Bettina, who\nwas still in short frocks, took her up.\n\n\"What is she not?\" she asked.\n\n\"Ah!--it is difficult to explain--to Americans. It is really not exactly\na fault. But she is not of his world.\"\n\n\"But if he does not like that,\" said Bettina coolly, \"why did he let her\nbuy him and pay for him?\"\n\nIt was young and brutal, but there were times when the business\nperspicuity of the first Reuben Vanderpoel, combining with the fiery,\nwounded spirit of his young descendant, rendered Bettina brutal. She saw\ncertain unadorned facts with unsparing young eyes and wanted to state\nthem. After her frocks were lengthened, she learned how to state them\nwith more fineness of phrase, but even then she was sometimes still\nrather unsparing.\n\nIn this case her companion, who was not fiery of temperament, only\ncoloured slightly.\n\n\"It was not quite that,\" she answered. \"Gaston really is fond of her.\nShe amuses him, and he says she is far cleverer than he is.\"\n\nBut there were unions less satisfactory, and Bettina had opportunities\nto reflect upon these also. The English and Continental papers did\nnot give enthusiastic, detailed descriptions of the marriages New York\njournals dwelt upon with such delight. They were passed over with a\nparagraph. When Betty heard them spoken of in France, Germany or Italy,\nshe observed that they were not, as a rule, spoken of respectfully. It\nseemed to her that the bridegrooms were, in conversation, treated by\ntheir equals with scant respect. It appeared that there had always been\nsome extremely practical reason for the passion which had led them to\nthe altar. One generally gathered that they or their estates were very\nmuch out at elbow, and frequently their characters were not considered\nadmirable by their relatives and acquaintances. Some had been rather\ncold shouldered in certain capitals on account of embarrassing little,\nor big, stories. Some had spent their patrimonies in riotous living.\nThose who had merely begun by coming into impoverished estates, and had\nlater attenuated their resources by comparatively decent follies, were\nof the more desirable order. By the time she was nineteen, Bettina had\nfelt the blood surge in her veins more than once when she heard some\ncomments on alliances over which she had seen her compatriots glow with\naffectionate delight.\n\n\"It was time Ludlow married some girl with money,\" she heard said of one\nsuch union. \"He had been playing the fool ever since he came into\nthe estate. Horses and a lot of stupid women. He had come some awful\ncroppers during the last ten years. Good-enough looking girl, they tell\nme--the American he has married--tremendous lot of money. Couldn't\nhave picked it up on this side. English young women of fortune are not\nlooking for that kind of thing. Poor old Billy wasn't good enough.\"\n\nBettina told the story to her father when they next met. She had grown\ninto a tall young creature by this time. Her low, full voice was like a\nbell and was capable of ringing forth some fine, mellow tones of irony.\n\n\"And in America we are pleased,\" she said, \"and flatter ourselves that\nwe are receiving the proper tribute of adoration of our American wit and\nbeauty. We plume ourselves on our conquests.\"\n\n\"No, Betty,\" said her father, and his reflective deliberation had\nmeaning. \"There are a lot of us who don't plume ourselves particularly\nin these days. We are not as innocent as we were when this sort of thing\nbegan. We are not as innocent as we were when Rosy was married.\" And\nhe sighed and rubbed his forehead with the handle of his pen. \"Not as\ninnocent as we were when Rosy was married,\" he repeated.\n\nBettina went to him and slid her fine young arm round his neck. It was\na long, slim, round arm with a wonderful power to caress in its curves.\nShe kissed Vanderpoel's lined cheek.\n\n\"Have you had time to think much about Rosy?\" she said.\n\n\"I've not had time, but I've done it,\" he answered. \"Anything that hurts\nyour mother hurts me. Sometimes she begins to cry in her sleep, and when\nI wake her she tells me she has been dreaming that she has seen Rosy.\"\n\n\"I have had time to think of her,\" said Bettina. \"I have heard so much\nof these things. I was at school in Germany when Annie Butterfield and\nBaron von Steindahl were married. I heard it talked about there, and\nthen my mother sent me some American papers.\"\n\nShe laughed a little, and for a moment her laugh did not sound like a\ngirl's.\n\n\"Well, it's turned out badly enough,\" her father commented. \"The papers\nhad plenty to say about it later. There wasn't much he was too good to\ndo to his wife, apparently.\"\n\n\"There was nothing too bad for him to do before he had a wife,\" said\nBettina. \"He was black. It was an insolence that he should have dared to\nspeak to Annie Butterfield. Somebody ought to have beaten him.\"\n\n\"He beat her instead.\"\n\n\"Yes, and I think his family thought it quite natural. They said that\nshe was so vulgar and American that she exasperated Frederick beyond\nendurance. She was not geboren, that was it.\" She laughed her severe\nlittle laugh again. \"Perhaps we shall get tired in time,\" she added. \"I\nthink we are learning. If it is made a matter of business quite open and\naboveboard, it will be fair. You know, father, you always said that I\nwas businesslike.\"\n\nThere was interested curiosity in Vanderpoel's steady look at her. There\nwere times when he felt that Betty's summing up of things was well worth\nlistening to. He saw that now she was in one of her moods when it would\npay one to hear her out. She held her chin up a little, and her face\ntook on a fine stillness at once sweet and unrelenting. She was very\ngood to look at in such moments.\n\n\"Yes,\" he answered, \"you have a particularly level head for a girl.\"\n\n\"Well,\" she went on. \"What I see is that these things are not business,\nand they ought to be. If a man comes to a rich American girl and says,\n'I and my title are for sale. Will you buy us?' If the girl is--is that\nkind of a girl and wants that kind of man, she can look them both over\nand say, 'Yes, I will buy you,' and it can be arranged. He will not\nreturn the money if he is unsatisfactory, but she cannot complain that\nshe has been deceived. She can only complain of that when he pretends\nthat he asks her to marry him because he wants her for his wife, because\nhe would want her for his wife if she were as poor as himself. Let it\nbe understood that he is property for sale, let her make sure that he is\nthe kind of property she wants to buy. Then, if, when they are married,\nhe is brutal or impudent, or his people are brutal or impudent, she can\nsay, 'I will forfeit the purchase money, but I will not forfeit myself.\nI will not stay with you.'\"\n\n\"They would not like to hear you say that, Betty,\" said her father,\nrubbing his chin reflectively.\n\n\"No,\" she answered. \"Neither the girl nor the man would like it, and it\nis their business, not mine. But it is practical and would prevent silly\nmistakes. It would prevent the girls being laughed at. It is when they\nare flattered by the choice made of them that they are laughed at. No\none can sneer at a man or woman for buying what they think they want,\nand throwing it aside if it turns out a bad bargain.\"\n\nShe had seated herself near her father. She rested her elbow slightly\non the table and her chin in the hollow of her hand. She was a beautiful\nyoung creature. She had a soft curving mouth, and a soft curving cheek\nwhich was warm rose. Taken in conjunction with those young charms, her\nnext words had an air of incongruity.\n\n\"You think I am hard,\" she said. \"When I think of these things I\nam hard--as hard as nails. That is an Americanism, but it is a good\nexpression. I am angry for America. If we are sordid and undignified,\nlet us get what we pay for and make the others acknowledge that we have\npaid.\"\n\nShe did not smile, nor did her father. Mr. Vanderpoel, on the contrary,\nsighed. He had a dreary suspicion that Rosy, at least, had not received\nwhat she had paid for, and he knew she had not been in the least aware\nthat she had paid or that she was expected to do so. Several times\nduring the last few years he had thought that if he had not been so hard\nworked, if he had had time, he would have seriously investigated\nthe case of Rosy. But who is not aware that the profession of\nmultimillionaire does not allow of any swerving from duty or of any\ninterests requiring leisure?\n\n\"I wonder, Betty,\" he said quite deliberately, \"if you know how handsome\nyou are?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Bettina. \"I think so. And I am tall. It is the fashion\nto be tall now. It was Early Victorian to be little. The Queen brought\nin the 'dear little woman,' and now the type has gone out.\"\n\n\"They will come to look at you pretty soon,\" said Vanderpoel. \"What\nshall you say then?\"\n\n\"I?\" said Bettina, and her voice sounded particularly low and mellow.\n\"I have a little monomania, father. Some people have a monomania for one\nthing and some for another. Mine is for NOT taking a bargain from the\nducal remnant counter.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nAN UNFAIR ENDOWMENT\n\nTo Bettina Vanderpoel had been given, to an extraordinary extent, the\nextraordinary thing which is called beauty--which is a thing\nentirely set apart from mere good looks or prettiness. This thing\nis extraordinary because, if statistics were taken, the result would\nprobably be the discovery that not three human beings in a million\nreally possess it. That it should be bestowed at all--since it is so\nrare--seems as unfair a thing as appears to the mere mortal mind the\nbestowal of unbounded wealth, since it quite as inevitably places the\nlife of its owner upon an abnormal plane. There are millions of pretty\nwomen, and billions of personable men, but the man or woman of entire\nphysical beauty may cross one's pathway only once in a lifetime--or not\nat all. In the latter case it is natural to doubt the absolute truth of\nthe rumours that the thing exists. The abnormal creature seems a mere\nfreak of nature and may chance to be angel, criminal, total insipidity,\nvirago or enchanter, but let such an one enter a room or appear in the\nstreet, and heads must turn, eyes light and follow, souls yearn or\nenvy, or sink under the discouragement of comparison. With the complete\nharmony and perfect balance of the singular thing, it would be folly for\nthe rest of the world to compete. A human being who had lived in poverty\nfor half a lifetime, might, if suddenly endowed with limitless fortune,\nretain, to a certain extent, balance of mind; but the same creature\nhaving lived the same number of years a wholly unlovely thing, suddenly\nawakening to the possession of entire physical beauty, might find the\nstrain upon pure sanity greater and the balance less easy to preserve.\nThe relief from the conscious or unconscious tension bred by the sense\nof imperfection, the calm surety of the fearlessness of meeting in\nany eye a look not lighted by pleasure, would be less normal than the\nknowledge that no wish need remain unfulfilled, no fancy ungratified.\nEven at sixteen Betty was a long-limbed young nymph whose small head,\nset high on a fine slim column of throat, might well have been crowned\nwith the garland of some goddess of health and the joy of life. She was\nlight and swift, and being a creature of long lines and tender curves,\nthere was pleasure in the mere seeing her move. The cut of her spirited\nlip, and delicate nostril, made for a profile at which one turned to\nlook more than once, despite one's self. Her hair was soft and black and\nrepeated its colour in the extravagant lashes of her childhood, which\nmade mysterious the changeful dense blue of her eyes. They were eyes\nwith laughter in them and pride, and a suggestion of many deep things\nyet unstirred. She was rather unusually tall, and her body had the\nsuppleness of a young bamboo. The deep corners of her red mouth curled\ngenerously, and the chin, melting into the fine line of the lovely\nthroat, was at once strong and soft and lovely. She was a creature of\nharmony, warm richness of colour, and brilliantly alluring life.\n\nWhen her school days were over she returned to New York and gave\nherself into her mother's hands. Her mother's kindness of heart and\nsweet-tempered lovingness were touching things to Bettina. In the midst\nof her millions Mrs. Vanderpoel was wholly unworldly. Bettina knew that\nshe felt a perpetual homesickness when she allowed herself to think of\nthe daughter who seemed lost to her, and the girl's realisation of this\ncaused her to wish to be especially affectionate and amenable. She was\nglad that she was tall and beautiful, not merely because such physical\ngifts added to the colour and agreeableness of life, but because\nhers gave comfort and happiness to her mother. To Mrs. Vanderpoel, to\nintroduce to the world the loveliest debutante of many years was to be\nlaunched into a new future. To concern one's self about her exquisite\nwardrobe was to have an enlivening occupation. To see her surrounded,\nto watch eyes as they followed her, to hear her praised, was to feel\nsomething of the happiness she had known in those younger days when New\nYork had been less advanced in its news and methods, and slim little\nblonde Rosalie had come out in white tulle and waltzed like a fairy with\na hundred partners.\n\n\"I wonder what Rosy looks like now,\" the poor woman said involuntarily\none day. Bettina was not a fairy. When her mother uttered her\nexclamation Bettina was on the point of going out, and as she stood near\nher, wrapped in splendid furs, she had the air of a Russian princess.\n\n\"She could not have worn the things you do, Betty,\" said the affectionate\nmaternal creature. \"She was such a little, slight thing. But she was\nvery pretty. I wonder if twelve years have changed her much?\"\n\nBetty turned towards her rather suddenly.\n\n\"Mother,\" she said, \"sometime, before very long, I am going to see.\"\n\n\"To see!\" exclaimed Mrs. Vanderpoel. \"To see Rosy!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Betty answered. \"I have a plan. I have never told you of it, but\nI have been thinking over it ever since I was fifteen years old.\"\n\nShe went to her mother and kissed her. She wore a becoming but resolute\nexpression.\n\n\"We will not talk about it now,\" she said. \"There are some things I must\nfind out.\"\n\nWhen she had left the room, which she did almost immediately, Mrs.\nVanderpoel sat down and cried. She nearly always shed a few tears\nwhen anyone touched upon the subject of Rosy. On her desk were some\nphotographs. One was of Rosy as a little girl with long hair, one was of\nLady Anstruthers in her wedding dress, and one was of Sir Nigel.\n\n\"I never felt as if I quite liked him,\" she said, looking at this last,\n\"but I suppose she does, or she would not be so happy that she could\nforget her mother and sister.\"\n\nThere was another picture she looked at. Rosalie had sent it with the\nletter she wrote to her father after he had forwarded the money she\nasked for. It was a little study in water colours of the head of her\nboy. It was nothing but a head, the shoulders being fancifully draped,\nbut the face was a peculiar one. It was over-mature, and unlovely, but\nfor a mouth at once pathetic and sweet.\n\n\"He is not a pretty child,\" sighed Mrs. Vanderpoel. \"I should have\nthought Rosy would have had pretty babies. Ughtred is more like his\nfather than his mother.\"\n\nShe spoke to her husband later, of what Betty had said.\n\n\"What do you think she has in her mind, Reuben?\" she asked.\n\n\"What Betty has in her mind is usually good sense,\" was his response.\n\"She will begin to talk to me about it presently. I shall not ask\nquestions yet. She is probably thinking things over.\"\n\nShe was, in truth, thinking things over, as she had been doing for some\ntime. She had asked questions on several occasions of English people she\nhad met abroad. But a schoolgirl cannot ask many questions, and though\nshe had once met someone who knew Sir Nigel Anstruthers, it was a person\nwho did not know him well, for the reason that she had not desired\nto increase her slight acquaintance. This lady was the aunt of one\nof Bettina's fellow pupils, and she was not aware of the girl's\nrelationship to Sir Nigel. What Betty gathered was that her\nbrother-in-law was regarded as a decidedly bad lot, that since his\nmarriage to some American girl he had seemed to have money which he\nspent in riotous living, and that the wife, who was said to be a silly\ncreature, was kept in the country, either because her husband did not\nwant her in London, or because she preferred to stay at Stornham. About\nthe wife no one appeared to know anything, in fact.\n\n\"She is rather a fool, I believe, and Sir Nigel Anstruthers is the kind\nof man a simpleton would be obliged to submit to,\" Bettina had heard the\nlady say.\n\nHer own reflections upon these comments had led her through various\npaths of thought. She could recall Rosalie's girlhood, and what\nshe herself, as an unconsciously observing child, had known of her\ncharacter. She remembered the simple impressionability of her mind. She\nhad been the most amenable little creature in the world. Her yielding\namiability could always be counted upon as a factor by the calculating;\nsweet-tempered to weakness, she could be beguiled or distressed into any\ncourse the desires of others dictated. An ill-tempered or self-pitying\nperson could alter any line of conduct she herself wished to pursue.\n\n\"She was neither clever nor strong-minded,\" Betty said to herself. \"A\nman like Sir Nigel Anstruthers could make what he chose of her. I wonder\nwhat he has done to her?\"\n\nOf one thing she thought she was sure. This was that Rosalie's aloofness\nfrom her family was the result of his design.\n\nShe comprehended, in her maturer years, the dislike of her childhood.\nShe remembered a certain look in his face which she had detested. She\nhad not known then that it was the look of a rather clever brute, who\nwas malignant, but she knew now.\n\n\"He used to hate us all,\" she said to herself. \"He did not mean to know\nus when he had taken Rosalie away, and he did not intend that she should\nknow us.\"\n\nShe had heard rumours of cases somewhat parallel, cases in which girls'\nlives had become swamped in those of their husbands, and their husbands'\nfamilies. And she had also heard unpleasant details of the means\nemployed to reach the desired results. Annie Butterfield's husband had\nforbidden her to correspond with her American relatives. He had argued\nthat such correspondence was disturbing to her mind, and to the domestic\nduties which should be every decent woman's religion. One of the\noccasions of his beating her had been in consequence of his finding her\nwriting to her mother a letter blotted with tears. Husbands frequently\nobjected to their wives' relatives, but there was a special order\nof European husband who opposed violently any intimacy with American\nrelations on the practical ground that their views of a wife's position,\nwith regard to her husband, were of a revolutionary nature.\n\nMrs. Vanderpoel had in her possession every letter Rosalie or her\nhusband had ever written. Bettina asked to be allowed to read them, and\none morning seated herself in her own room before a blazing fire, with\nthe collection on a table at her side. She read them in order. Nigel's\nbegan as they went on. They were all in one tone, formal, uninteresting,\nand requiring no answers. There was not a suggestion of human feeling in\none of them.\n\n\"He wrote them,\" said Betty, \"so that we could not say that he had never\nwritten.\"\n\nRosalie's first epistles were affectionate, but timid. At the outset\nshe was evidently trying to conceal the fact that she was homesick.\nGradually she became briefer and more constrained. In one she said\npathetically, \"I am such a bad letter writer. I always feel as if I want\nto tear up what I have written, because I never say half that is in my\nheart.\" Mrs. Vanderpoel had kissed that letter many a time. She was sure\nthat a mark on the paper near this particular sentence was where a tear\nhad fallen. Bettina was sure of this, too, and sat and looked at the\nfire for some time.\n\nThat night she went to a ball, and when she returned home, she persuaded\nher mother to go to bed.\n\n\"I want to have a talk with father,\" she exclaimed. \"I am going to ask\nhim something.\"\n\nShe went to the great man's private room, where he sat at work, even\nafter the hours when less seriously engaged people come home from balls.\nThe room he sat in was one of the apartments newspapers had with much\ndetail described. It was luxuriously comfortable, and its effect was\nsober and rich and fine.\n\nWhen Bettina came in, Vanderpoel, looking up to smile at her in welcome,\nwas struck by the fact that as a background to an entering figure of\ntall, splendid girlhood in a ball dress it was admirable, throwing up\nall its whiteness and grace and sweep of line. He was always glad to see\nBetty. The rich strength of the life radiating from her, the reality and\nglow of her were good for him and had the power of detaching him from\nwork of which he was tired.\n\nShe smiled back at him, and, coming forward took her place in a\nbig armchair close to him, her lace-frilled cloak slipping from\nher shoulders with a soft rustling sound which seemed to convey her\nintention to stay.\n\n\"Are you too busy to be interrupted?\" she asked, her mellow voice\ncaressing him. \"I want to talk to you about something I am going to do.\"\nShe put out her hand and laid it on his with a clinging firmness which\nmeant strong feeling. \"At least, I am going to do it if you will help\nme,\" she ended.\n\n\"What is it, Betty?\" he inquired, his usual interest in her accentuated\nby her manner.\n\nShe laid her other hand on his and he clasped both with his own.\n\n\"When the Worthingtons sail for England next month,\" she explained, \"I\nwant to go with them. Mrs. Worthington is very kind and will be good\nenough to take care of me until I reach London.\"\n\nMr. Vanderpoel moved slightly in his chair. Then their eyes met\ncomprehendingly. He saw what hers held.\n\n\"From there you are going to Stornham Court!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"To see Rosy,\" she answered, leaning a little forward. \"To SEE her.\n\n\"You believe that what has happened has not been her fault?\" he said.\nThere was a look in her face which warmed his blood.\n\n\"I have always been sure that Nigel Anstruthers arranged it.\"\n\n\"Do you think he has been unkind to her?\"\n\n\"I am going to see,\" she answered.\n\n\"Betty,\" he said, \"tell me all about it.\"\n\nHe knew that this was no suddenly-formed plan, and he knew it would\nbe well worth while to hear the details of its growth. It was so\ninterestingly like her to have remained silent through the process of\nthinking a thing out, evolving her final idea without having disturbed\nhim by bringing to him any chaotic uncertainties.\n\n\"It's a sort of confession,\" she answered. \"Father, I have been thinking\nabout it for years. I said nothing because for so long I knew I was only\na child, and a child's judgment might be worth so little. But through\nall those years I was learning things and gathering evidence. When I was\nat school, first in one country and then another, I used to tell myself\nthat I was growing up and preparing myself to do a particular thing--to\ngo to rescue Rosy.\"\n\n\"I used to guess you thought of her in a way of your own,\" Vanderpoel\nsaid, \"but I did not guess you were thinking that much. You were always\na solid, loyal little thing, and there was business capacity in your\nkeeping your scheme to yourself. Let us look the matter in the face.\nSuppose she does not need rescuing. Suppose, after all, she is a\ncomfortable, fine lady and adores her husband. What then?\"\n\n\"If I should find that to be true, I will behave myself very well--as\nif we had expected nothing else. I will make her a short visit and come\naway. Lady Cecilia Orme, whom I knew in Florence, has asked me to stay\nwith her in London. I will go to her. She is a charming woman. But I\nmust first see Rosy--SEE her.\"\n\nMr. Vanderpoel thought the matter over during a few moments of silence.\n\n\"You do not wish your mother to go with you?\" he said presently.\n\n\"I believe it will be better that she should not,\" she answered. \"If\nthere are difficulties or disappointments she would be too unhappy.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said slowly, \"and she could not control her feelings. She\nwould give the whole thing away, poor girl.\"\n\nHe had been looking at the carpet reflectively, and now he looked at\nBettina.\n\n\"What are you expecting to find, at the worst?\" he asked her. \"The kind\nof thing which will need management while it is being looked into?\"\n\n\"I do not know what I am expecting to find,\" was her reply. \"We know\nabsolutely nothing; but that Rosy was fond of us, and that her marriage\nhas seemed to make her cease to care. She was not like that; she was not\nlike that! Was she, father?\"\n\n\"No, she wasn't,\" he exclaimed. The memory of her in her short-frocked\nand early girlish days, a pretty, smiling, effusive thing, given to\nlavish caresses and affectionate little surprises for them all, came\nback to him vividly. \"She was the most affectionate girl I ever knew,\"\nhe said. \"She was more affectionate than you, Betty,\" with a smile.\n\nBettina smiled in return and bent her head to put a kiss on his hand, a\nwarm, lovely, comprehending kiss.\n\n\"If she had been different I should not have thought so much of the\nchange,\" she said. \"I believe that people are always more or less LIKE\nthemselves as long as they live. What has seemed to happen has been so\nunlike Rosy that there must be some reason for it.\"\n\n\"You think that she has been prevented from seeing us?\"\n\n\"I think it so possible that I am not going to announce my visit\nbeforehand.\"\n\n\"You have a good head, Betty,\" her father said.\n\n\"If Sir Nigel has put obstacles in our way before, he will do it again.\nI shall try to find out, when I reach London, if Rosalie is at Stornham.\nWhen I am sure she is there, I shall go and present myself. If Sir Nigel\nmeets me at the park gates and orders his gamekeepers to drive me off\nthe premises, we shall at least know that he has some reason for not\nwishing to regard the usual social and domestic amenities. I feel rather\nlike a detective. It entertains me and excites me a little.\"\n\nThe deep blue of her eyes shone under the shadow of the extravagant\nlashes as she laughed.\n\n\"Are you willing that I should go, father?\" she said next.\n\n\"Yes,\" he answered. \"I am willing to trust you, Betty, to do things I\nwould not trust other girls to try at. If you were not my girl at all,\nif you were a man on Wall Street, I should know you would be pretty safe\nto come out a little more than even in any venture you made. You know\nhow to keep cool.\"\n\nBettina picked up her fallen cloak and laid it over her arm. It was made\nof billowy frills of Malines lace, such as only Vanderpoels could buy.\nShe looked down at the amazing thing and touched up the frills with her\nfingers as she whimsically smiled.\n\n\"There are a good many girls who can be trusted to do things in these\ndays,\" she said. \"Women have found out so much. Perhaps it is because\nthe heroines of novels have informed them. Heroines and heroes always\nbring in the new fashions in character. I believe it is years since a\nheroine 'burst into a flood of tears.' It has been discovered, really,\nthat nothing is to be gained by it. Whatsoever I find at Stornham Court,\nI shall neither weep nor be helpless. There is the Atlantic cable, you\nknow. Perhaps that is one of the reasons why heroines have changed. When\nthey could not escape from their persecutors except in a stage coach,\nand could not send telegrams, they were more or less in everyone's\nhands. It is different now. Thank you, father, you are very good to\nbelieve in me.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nON BOARD THE \"MERIDIANA\"\n\nA large transatlantic steamer lying at the wharf on a brilliant, sunny\nmorning just before its departure is an interesting and suggestive\nobject to those who are fond of following suggestion to its end. One\nsometimes wonders if it is possible that the excitement in the dock\natmosphere could ever become a thing to which one was sufficiently\naccustomed to be able to regard it as among things commonplace. The\nrumbling and rattling of waggons and carts, the loading and unloading of\nboxes and bales, the people who are late, and the people who are early,\nthe faces which are excited, and the faces which are sad, the trunks and\nbales, and cranes which creak and groan, the shouts and cries, the hurry\nand confusion of movement, notwithstanding that every day has seen them\nall for years, have a sort of perennial interest to the looker-on.\n\nThis is, perhaps, more especially the case when the looker-on is to be\na passenger on the outgoing ship; and the exhilaration of his point of\nview may greatly depend upon the reason for his voyage and the class\nby which he travels. Gaiety and youth usually appear upon the promenade\ndeck, having taken saloon passage. Dulness, commerce, and eld mingling\nwith them, it is true, but with a discretion which does not seem to\ndominate. Second-class passengers wear a more practical aspect, and\nyouth among them is rarer and more grave. People who must travel second\nand third class make voyages for utilitarian reasons. Their object is\nusually to better themselves in one way or another. When they are going\nfrom Liverpool to New York, it is usually to enter upon new efforts and\nnew labours. When they are returning from New York to Liverpool, it is\noften because the new life has proved less to be depended upon than\nthe old, and they are bearing back with them bitterness of soul and\ndiscouragement of spirit.\n\nOn the brilliant spring morning when the huge liner Meridiana was to\nsail for England a young man, who was a second-class passenger, leaned\nupon the ship's rail and watched the turmoil on the wharf with a\ndetached and not at all buoyant air.\n\nHis air was detached because he had other things in his mind than those\nmerely passing before him, and he was not buoyant because they were not\ncheerful or encouraging subjects for reflection. He was a big young man,\nwell hung together, and carrying himself well; his face was square-jawed\nand rugged, and he had dark red hair restrained by its close cut from\nwaving strongly on his forehead. His eyes were red brown, and a few dark\nfreckles marked his clear skin. He was of the order of man one looks at\ntwice, having looked at him once, though one does not in the least know\nwhy, unless one finally reaches some degree of intimacy.\n\nHe watched the vehicles, heavy and light, roll into the big shed-like\nbuilding and deposit their freight; he heard the voices and caught the\nsentences of instruction and comment; he saw boxes and bales hauled from\nthe dock side to the deck and swung below with the rattling of machinery\nand chains. But these formed merely a noisy background to his mood,\nwhich was self-centred and gloomy. He was one of those who go back to\ntheir native land knowing themselves conquered. He had left England two\nyears before, feeling obstinately determined to accomplish a certain\ndifficult thing, but forces of nature combining with the circumstances\nof previous education and living had beaten him. He had lost two years\nand all the money he had ventured. He was going back to the place he\nhad come from, and he was carrying with him a sense of having been used\nhardly by fortune, and in a way he had not deserved.\n\nHe had gone out to the West with the intention of working hard and using\nhis hands as well as his brains; he had not been squeamish; he had, in\nfact, laboured like a ploughman; and to be obliged to give in had been\ngalling and bitter. There are human beings into whose consciousness of\nthemselves the possibility of being beaten does not enter. This man was\none of them.\n\nThe ship was of the huge and luxuriously-fitted class by which the rich\nand fortunate are transported from one continent to another. Passengers\ncould indulge themselves in suites of rooms and live sumptuously. As the\nman leaning on the rail looked on, he saw messengers bearing baskets and\nboxes of fruit and flowers with cards and notes attached, hurrying up\nthe gangway to deliver them to waiting stewards. These were the farewell\nofferings to be placed in staterooms, or to await their owners on the\nsaloon tables. Salter--the second-class passenger's name was Salter--had\nseen a few such offerings before on the first crossing. But there had\nnot been such lavishness at Liverpool. It was the New Yorkers who\nwere sumptuous in such matters, as he had been told. He had also heard\ncasually that the passenger list on this voyage was to record important\nnames, the names of multi-millionaire people who were going over for the\nLondon season.\n\nTwo stewards talking near him, earlier in the morning, had been exulting\nover the probable largesse such a list would result in at the end of the\npassage.\n\n\"The Worthingtons and the Hirams and the John William Spayters,\" said\none. \"They travel all right. They know what they want and they want a\ngood deal, and they're willing to pay for it.\"\n\n\"Yes. They're not school teachers going over to improve their minds and\ncontriving to cross in a big ship by economising in everything else.\nMiss Vanderpoel's sailing with the Worthingtons. She's got the best\nsuite all to herself. She'll bring back a duke or one of those prince\nfellows. How many millions has Vanderpoel?\"\n\n\"How many millions. How many hundred millions!\" said his companion,\ngloating cheerfully over the vastness of unknown possibilities. \"I've\ncrossed with Miss Vanderpoel often, two or three times when she was in\nshort frocks. She's the kind of girl you read about. And she's got money\nenough to buy in half a dozen princes.\"\n\n\"There are New Yorkers who won't like it if she does,\" returned the\nother. \"There's been too much money going out of the country. Her\nsuite is crammed full of Jack roses, now, and there are boxes waiting\noutside.\"\n\nSalter moved away and heard no more. He moved away, in fact, because he\nwas conscious that to a man in his case, this dwelling upon millions,\nthis plethora of wealth, was a little revolting. He had walked down\nBroadway and seen the price of Jacqueminot roses, and he was not soothed\nor allured at this particular moment by the picture of a girl whose\nhalf-dozen cabins were crowded with them.\n\n\"Oh, the devil!\" he said. \"It sounds vulgar.\" And he walked up and\ndown fast, squaring his shoulders, with his hands in the pockets of his\nrough, well-worn coat. He had seen in England something of the American\nyoung woman with millionaire relatives. He had been scarcely more than a\nboy when the American flood first began to rise. He had been old enough,\nhowever, to hear people talk. As he had grown older, Salter had observed\nits advance. Englishmen had married American beauties. American fortunes\nhad built up English houses, which otherwise threatened to fall into\ndecay. Then the American faculty of adaptability came into play.\nAnglo-American wives became sometimes more English than their husbands.\nThey proceeded to Anglicise their relations, their relations' clothes,\neven, in time, their speech. They carried or sent English conventions to\nthe States, their brothers ordered their clothes from West End tailors,\ntheir sisters began to wear walking dresses, to play out-of-door games\nand take active exercise. Their mothers tentatively took houses in\nLondon or Paris, there came a period when their fathers or uncles,\nserious or anxious business men, the most unsporting of human beings,\nrented castles or manors with huge moors and covers attached and\nentertained large parties of shooters or fishers who could be lured to\nany quarter by the promise of the particular form of slaughter for which\nthey burned.\n\n\"Sheer American business perspicacity, that,\" said Salter, as he marched\nup and down, thinking of a particular case of this order. \"There's\nsomething admirable in the practical way they make for what they want.\nThey want to amalgamate with English people, not for their own sake,\nbut because their women like it, and so they offer the men thousands of\nacres full of things to kill. They can get them by paying for them,\nand they know how to pay.\" He laughed a little, lifting his square\nshoulders. \"Balthamor's six thousand acres of grouse moor and Elsty's\nsalmon fishing are rented by the Chicago man. He doesn't care twopence\nfor them, and does not know a pheasant from a caper-cailzie, but his\nwife wants to know men who do.\"\n\nIt must be confessed that Salter was of the English who were not pleased\nwith the American Invasion. In some of his views of the matter he was a\nlittle prehistoric and savage, but the modern side of his character\nwas too intelligent to lack reason. He was by no means entirely modern,\nhowever; a large part of his nature belonged to the age in which men\nhad fought fiercely for what they wanted to get or keep, and when the\namenities of commerce had not become powerful factors in existence.\n\n\"They're not a bad lot,\" he was thinking at this moment. \"They are\nrather fine in a way. They are clever and powerful and interesting--more\nso than they know themselves. But it is all commerce. They don't come\nand fight with us and get possession of us by force. They come and\nbuy us. They buy our land and our homes, and our landowners, for that\nmatter--when they don't buy them, they send their women to marry them,\nconfound it!\"\n\nHe took half a dozen more strides and lifted his shoulders again.\n\n\"Beggarly lot as I am,\" he said, \"unlikely as it seems that I can marry\nat all, I'm hanged if I don't marry an Englishwoman, if I give my life\nto a woman at all.\"\n\nBut, in fact, he was of the opinion that he should never give his life\nto any woman, and this was because he was, at this period, also of the\nopinion that there was small prospect of its ever being worth the giving\nor taking. It had been one of those lives which begin untowardly and are\nruled by unfair circumstances.\n\nHe had a particularly well-cut and expressive mouth, and, as he went\nback to the ship's side and leaned on his folded arms on the rail again,\nits curves concealed a good deal of strong feeling.\n\nThe wharf was busier than before. In less than half an hour the ship\nwas to sail. The bustle and confusion had increased. There were people\nhurrying about looking for friends, and there were people scribbling\noff excited farewell messages at the telegraph office. The situation was\nworking up to its climax. An observing looker-on might catch glimpses of\nemotional scenes. Many of the passengers were already on board, parties\nof them accompanied by their friends were making their way up the\ngangplank.\n\nSalter had just been watching a luxuriously cared-for little invalid\nwoman being carried on deck in a reclining chair, when his attention\nwas attracted by the sound of trampling hoofs and rolling wheels. Two\nnoticeably big and smart carriages had driven up to the stopping-place\nfor vehicles. They were gorgeously of the latest mode, and their tall,\nsatin-skinned horses jangled silver chains and stepped up to their\nnoses.\n\n\"Here come the Worthingtons, whosoever they may be,\" thought\nSalter. \"The fine up-standing young woman is, no doubt, the\nmulti-millionairess.\"\n\nThe fine, up-standing young woman WAS the multi-millionairess. Bettina\nwalked up the gangway in the sunshine, and the passengers upon the upper\ndeck craned their necks to look at her. Her carriage of her head and\nshoulders invariably made people turn to look.\n\n\"My, ain't she fine-looking!\" exclaimed an excited lady beholder above.\n\"I guess that must be Miss Vanderpoel, the multi-millionaire's daughter.\nJane told me she'd heard she was crossing this trip.\"\n\nBettina heard her. She sometimes wondered if she was ever pointed out,\nif her name was ever mentioned without the addition of the explanatory\nstatement that she was the multi-millionaire's daughter. As a child she\nhad thought it ridiculous and tiresome, as she had grown older she had\nfelt that only a remarkable individuality could surmount a fact so ever\npresent.\n\nIt was like a tremendous quality which overshadowed everything else.\n\n\"It wounds my vanity, I have no doubt,\" she had said to her father.\n\"Nobody ever sees me, they only see you and your millions and millions\nof dollars.\"\n\nSalter watched her pass up the gangway. The phase through which he\nwas living was not of the order which leads a man to dwell upon the\nbeautiful and inspiriting as expressed by the female image. Success and\nthe hopefulness which engender warmth of soul and quickness of heart\nare required for the development of such allurements. He thought of the\nVanderpoel millions as the lady on the deck had thought of them, and\nin his mind somehow the girl herself appeared to express them. The rich\nup-springing sweep of her abundant hair, her height, her colouring, the\nremarkable shade and length of her lashes, the full curve of her mouth,\nall, he told himself, looked expensive, as if even nature herself had\nbeen given carte blanche, and the best possible articles procured for\nthe money.\n\n\"She moves,\" he thought sardonically, \"as if she were perfectly\naware that she could pay for anything. An unlimited income, no doubt,\nestablishes in the owner the equivalent to a sense of rank.\"\n\nHe changed his position for one in which he could command a view of the\npromenade deck where the arriving passengers were gradually appearing.\nHe did this from the idle and careless curiosity which, though it is not\na matter of absolute interest, does not object to being entertained by\npassing objects. He saw the Worthington party reappear. It struck Salter\nthat they looked not so much like persons coming on board a ship, as\nlike people who were returning to a hotel to which they were accustomed,\nand which was also accustomed to them. He argued that they had probably\ncrossed the Atlantic innumerable times in this particular steamer.\nThe deck stewards knew them and made obeisance with empressement. Miss\nVanderpoel nodded to the steward Salter had heard discussing her. She\ngave him a smile of recognition and paused a moment to speak to him.\nSalter saw her sweep the deck with her glance and then designate a\nsequestered corner, such as the experienced voyager would recognise as\nbeing desirably sheltered. She was evidently giving an order concerning\nthe placing of her deck chair, which was presently brought. An elegantly\nneat and decorous person in black, who was evidently her maid, appeared\nlater, followed by a steward who carried cushions and sumptuous fur\nrugs. These being arranged, a delightful corner was left alluringly\nprepared. Miss Vanderpoel, after her instructions to the deck steward,\nhad joined her party and seemed to be awaiting some arrival anxiously.\n\n\"She knows how to do herself well,\" Salter commented, \"and she realises\nthat forethought is a practical factor. Millions have been productive of\ncomposure. It is not unnatural, either.\"\n\nIt was but a short time later that the warning bell was rung. Stewards\npassed through the crowds calling out, \"All ashore, if you please--all\nashore.\" Final embraces were in order on all sides. People shook hands\nwith fervour and laughed a little nervously. Women kissed each other and\npoured forth hurried messages to be delivered on the other side of\nthe Atlantic. Having kissed and parted, some of them rushed back and\nindulged in little clutches again. Notwithstanding that the tide of\nhumanity surges across the Atlantic almost as regularly as the daily\ntide surges in on its shores, a wave of emotion sweeps through every\nship at such partings.\n\nSalter stood on deck and watched the crowd dispersing. Some of the\npeople were laughing and some had red eyes. Groups collected on the\nwharf and tried to say still more last words to their friends crowding\nagainst the rail.\n\nThe Worthingtons kept their places and were still looking out, by this\ntime disappointedly. It seemed that the friend or friends they\nexpected were not coming. Salter saw that Miss Vanderpoel looked more\ndisappointed than the rest. She leaned forward and strained her eyes to\nsee. Just at the last moment there was the sound of trampling horses and\nrolling wheels again. From the arriving carriage descended hastily an\nelderly woman, who lifted out a little boy excited almost to tears. He\nwas a dear, chubby little person in flapping sailor trousers, and he\ncarried a splendidly-caparisoned toy donkey in his arms. Salter could\nnot help feeling slightly excited himself as they rushed forward. He\nwondered if they were passengers who would be left behind.\n\nThey were not passengers, but the arrivals Miss Vanderpoel had been\nexpecting so ardently. They had come to say good-bye to her and were too\nlate for that, at least, as the gangway was just about to be withdrawn.\n\nMiss Vanderpoel leaned forward with an amazingly fervid expression on\nher face.\n\n\"Tommy! Tommy!\" she cried to the little boy. \"Here I am, Tommy. We can\nsay good-bye from here.\"\n\nThe little boy, looking up, broke into a wail of despair.\n\n\"Betty! Betty! Betty!\" he cried. \"I wanted to kiss you, Betty.\"\n\nBetty held out her arms. She did it with entire forgetfulness of the\nexistence of any lookers-on, and with such outreaching love on her\nface that it seemed as if the child must feel her touch. She made a\nbeautiful, warm, consoling bud of her mouth.\n\n\"We'll kiss each other from here, Tommy,\" she said. \"See, we can. Kiss\nme, and I will kiss you.\"\n\nTommy held out his arms and the magnificent donkey. \"Betty,\" he cried,\n\"I brought you my donkey. I wanted to give it to you for a present,\nbecause you liked it.\"\n\nMiss Vanderpoel bent further forward and addressed the elderly woman.\n\n\"Matilda,\" she said, \"please pack Master Tommy's present and send it to\nme! I want it very much.\"\n\nTender smiles irradiated the small face. The gangway was withdrawn, and,\namid the familiar sounds of a big craft's first struggle, the ship began\nto move. Miss Vanderpoel still bent forward and held out her arms.\n\n\"I will soon come back, Tommy,\" she cried, \"and we are always friends.\"\n\nThe child held out his short blue serge arms also, and Salter watching\nhim could not but be touched for all his gloom of mind.\n\n\"I wanted to kiss you, Betty,\" he heard in farewell. \"I did so want to\nkiss you.\"\n\nAnd so they steamed away upon the blue.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nTHE SECOND-CLASS PASSENGER\n\nUp to a certain point the voyage was like all other voyages. During the\nfirst two days there were passengers who did not appear on deck, but\nas the weather was fair for the season of the year, there were fewer\nabsentees than is usual. Indeed, on the third day the deck chairs were\nall filled, people who were given to tramping during their voyages had\nbegun to walk their customary quota of carefully-measured miles the\nday. There were a few pale faces dozing here and there, but the general\naspect of things had begun to be sprightly. Shuffleboard players and\nquoit enthusiasts began to bestir themselves, the deck steward appeared\nregularly with light repasts of beef tea and biscuits, and the brilliant\nhues of red, blue, or yellow novels made frequent spots of colour upon\nthe promenade. Persons of some initiative went to the length of making\ntentative observations to their next-chair neighbours. The second-cabin\npassengers were cheerful, and the steerage passengers, having tumbled\nup, formed friendly groups and began to joke with each other.\n\nThe Worthingtons had plainly the good fortune to be respectable sailors.\nThey reappeared on the second day and established regular habits, after\nthe manner of accustomed travellers. Miss Vanderpoel's habits were\nregular from the first, and when Salter saw her he was impressed even\nmore at the outset with her air of being at home instead of on board\nship. Her practically well-chosen corner was an agreeable place to look\nat. Her chair was built for ease of angle and width, her cushions were\nof dark rich colours, her travelling rugs were of black fox fur, and\nshe owned an adjustable table for books and accompaniments. She appeared\nearly in the morning and walked until the sea air crimsoned her cheeks,\nshe sat and read with evident enjoyment, she talked to her companions\nand plainly entertained them.\n\nSalter, being bored and in bad spirits, found himself watching her\nrather often, but he knew that but for the small, comic episode of\nTommy, he would have definitely disliked her. The dislike would not have\nbeen fair, but it would have existed in spite of himself. It would\nnot have been fair because it would have been founded simply upon the\nignoble resentment of envy, upon the poor truth that he was not in the\nstate of mind to avoid resenting the injustice of fate in bestowing\nmulti-millions upon one person and his offspring. He resented his own\nresentment, but was obliged to acknowledge its existence in his humour.\nHe himself, especially and peculiarly, had always known the bitterness\nof poverty, the humiliation of seeing where money could be well used,\nindeed, ought to be used, and at the same time having ground into him\nthe fact that there was no money to lay one's hand on. He had hated it\neven as a boy, because in his case, and that of his people, the whole\nthing was undignified and unbecoming. It was humiliating to him now to\nbring home to himself the fact that the thing for which he was inclined\nto dislike this tall, up-standing girl was her unconscious (he realised\nthe unconsciousness of it) air of having always lived in the atmosphere\nof millions, of never having known a reason why she should not have\nanything she had a desire for. Perhaps, upon the whole, he said to\nhimself, it was his own ill luck and sense of defeat which made her\ncorner, with its cushions and comforts, her properly attentive maid,\nand her cold weather sables expressive of a fortune too colossal to be\ndecent.\n\nThe episode of the plump, despairing Tommy he had liked, however. There\nhad been a fine naturalness about it and a fine practicalness in her\nprompt order to the elderly nurse that the richly-caparisoned donkey\nshould be sent to her. This had at once made it clear to the donor that\nhis gift was too valuable to be left behind.\n\n\"She did not care twopence for the lot of us,\" was his summing up. \"She\nmight have been nothing but the nicest possible warm-hearted nursemaid\nor a cottage woman who loved the child.\"\n\nHe was quite aware that though he had found himself more than once\nobserving her, she herself had probably not recognised the trivial fact\nof his existing upon that other side of the barrier which separated the\nhigher grade of passenger from the lower. There was, indeed, no reason\nwhy she should have singled him out for observation, and she was, in\nfact, too frequently absorbed in her own reflections to be in the\nframe of mind to remark her fellow passengers to the extent which was\ngenerally customary with her. During her crossings of the Atlantic she\nusually made mental observation of the people on board. This time, when\nshe was not talking to the Worthingtons, or reading, she was thinking of\nthe possibilities of her visit to Stornham. She used to walk about the\ndeck thinking of them and, sitting in her chair, sum them up as her eyes\nrested on the rolling and breaking waves.\n\nThere were many things to be considered, and one of the first was the\nperfectly sane suggestion her father had made.\n\n\"Suppose she does not want to be rescued? Suppose you find her a\ncomfortable fine lady who adores her husband.\"\n\nSuch a thing was possible, though Bettina did not think it probable. She\nintended, however, to prepare herself even for this. If she found Lady\nAnstruthers plump and roseate, pleased with herself and her position,\nshe was quite equal to making her visit appear a casual and conventional\naffair.\n\n\"I ought to wish it to be so,\" she thought, \"and, yet, how\ndisappointingly I should feel she had changed. Still, even ethical\nreasons would not excuse one for wishing her to be miserable.\" She was a\ncreature with a number of passionate ideals which warred frequently with\nthe practical side of her mentality. Often she used to walk up and down\nthe deck or lean upon the ship's side, her eyes stormy with emotions.\n\n\"I do not want to find Rosy a heartless woman, and I do not want to find\nher wretched. What do I want? Only the usual thing--that what cannot be\nundone had never been done. People are always wishing that.\"\n\nShe was standing near the second-cabin barrier thinking this, the first\ntime she saw the passenger with the red hair. She had paused by mere\nchance, and while her eyes were stormy with her thought, she suddenly\nbecame conscious that she was looking directly into other eyes as\ndarkling as her own. They were those of a man on the wrong side of the\nbarrier. He had a troubled, brooding face, and, as their gaze met,\neach of them started slightly and turned away with the sense of having\nunconsciously intruded and having been intruded upon.\n\n\"That rough-looking man,\" she commented to herself, \"is as anxious and\ndisturbed as I am.\"\n\nSalter did look rough, it was true. His well-worn clothes had suffered\nsomewhat from the restrictions of a second-class cabin shared with two\nother men. But the aspect which had presented itself to her brief glance\nhad been not so much roughness of clothing as of mood expressing itself\nin his countenance. He was thinking harshly and angrily of the life\nahead of him.\n\nThese looks of theirs which had so inadvertently encountered each\nother were of that order which sometimes startles one when in passing a\nstranger one finds one's eyes entangled for a second in his or hers, as\nthe case may be. At such times it seems for that instant difficult to\ndisentangle one's gaze. But neither of these two thought of the other\nmuch, after hurrying away. Each was too fully mastered by personal mood.\n\nThere would, indeed, have been no reason for their encountering each\nother further but for \"the accident,\" as it was called when spoken of\nafterwards, the accident which might so easily have been a catastrophe.\nIt occurred that night. This was two nights before they were to land.\n\nEverybody had begun to come under the influence of that cheerfulness of\nhumour, the sense of relief bordering on gaiety, which generally elates\npeople when a voyage is drawing to a close. If one has been dull, one\nbegins to gather one's self together, rejoiced that the boredom is over.\nIn any case, there are plans to be made, thought of, or discussed.\n\n\"You wish to go to Stornham at once?\" Mrs. Worthington said to Bettina.\n\"How pleased Lady Anstruthers and Sir Nigel must be at the idea of\nseeing you with them after so long.\"\n\n\"I can scarcely tell you how I am looking forward to it,\" Betty\nanswered.\n\nShe sat in her corner among her cushions looking at the dark water\nwhich seemed to sweep past the ship, and listening to the throb of the\nengines. She was not gay. She was wondering how far the plans she had\nmade would prove feasible. Mrs. Worthington was not aware that her visit\nto Stornham Court was to be unannounced. It had not been necessary to\nexplain the matter. The whole affair was simple and decorous enough.\nMiss Vanderpoel was to bid good-bye to her friends and go at once to her\nsister, Lady Anstruthers, whose husband's country seat was but a short\njourney from London. Bettina and her father had arranged that the fact\nshould be kept from the society paragraphist. This had required some\nadroit management, but had actually been accomplished.\n\nAs the waves swished past her, Bettina was saying to herself, \"What\nwill Rosy say when she sees me! What shall I say when I see Rosy? We are\ndrawing nearer to each other with every wave that passes.\"\n\nA fog which swept up suddenly sent them all below rather early. The\nWorthingtons laughed and talked a little in their staterooms, but\npresently became quiet and had evidently gone to bed. Bettina was\nrestless and moved about her room alone after she had sent away her\nmaid. She at last sat down and finished a letter she had been writing to\nher father.\n\n\"As I near the land,\" she wrote, \"I feel a sort of excitement. Several\ntimes to-day I have recalled so distinctly the picture of Rosy as I saw\nher last, when we all stood crowded upon the wharf at New York to see\nher off. She and Nigel were leaning upon the rail of the upper deck.\nShe looked such a delicate, airy little creature, quite like a pretty\nschoolgirl with tears in her eyes. She was laughing and crying at the\nsame time, and kissing both her hands to us again and again. I was\ncrying passionately myself, though I tried to conceal the fact, and I\nremember that each time I looked from Rosy to Nigel's heavy face the\npoignancy of my anguish made me break forth again. I wonder if it was\nbecause I was a child, that he looked such a contemptuous brute, even\nwhen he pretended to smile. It is twelve years since then. I wonder--how\nI wonder, what I shall find.\"\n\nShe stopped writing and sat a few moments, her chin upon her hand,\nthinking. Suddenly she sprang to her feet in alarm. The stillness of the\nnight was broken by wild shouts, a running of feet outside, a tumult of\nmingled sounds and motion, a dash and rush of surging water, a strange\nthumping and straining of engines, and a moment later she was hurled\nfrom one side of her stateroom to the other by a crashing shock which\nseemed to heave the ship out of the sea, shuddering as if the end of all\nthings had come.\n\nIt was so sudden and horrible a thing that, though she had only been\nflung upon a pile of rugs and cushions and was unhurt, she felt as if\nshe had been struck on the head and plunged into wild delirium. Above\nthe sound of the dashing and rocking waves, the straining and roaring of\nhacking engines and the pandemonium of voices rose from one end of the\nship to the other, one wild, despairing, long-drawn shriek of women and\nchildren. Bettina turned sick at the mad terror in it--the insensate,\nawful horror.\n\n\n\"Something has run into us!\" she gasped, getting up with her heart\nleaping in her throat.\n\nShe could hear the Worthingtons' tempest of terrified confusion through\nthe partitions between them, and she remembered afterwards that in the\nspace of two or three seconds, and in the midst of their clamour, a\nhundred incongruous thoughts leaped through her brain. Perhaps they were\nthis moment going down. Now she knew what it was like! This thing she\nhad read of in newspapers! Now she was going down in mid-ocean, she,\nBetty Vanderpoel! And, as she sprang to clutch her fur coat, there\nflashed before her mental vision a gruesome picture of the headlines\nin the newspapers and the inevitable reference to the millions she\nrepresented.\n\n\"I must keep calm,\" she heard herself say, as she fastened the\nlong coat, clenching her teeth to keep them from chattering. \"Poor\nDaddy--poor Daddy!\"\n\nMaddening new sounds were all about her, sounds of water dashing and\nchurning, sounds of voices bellowing out commands, straining and leaping\nsounds of the engines. What was it--what was it? She must at least\nfind out. Everybody was going mad in the staterooms, the stewards were\nrushing about, trying to quiet people, their own voices shaking and\nbreaking into cracked notes. If the worst had happened, everyone would\nbe fighting for life in a few minutes. Out on deck she must get and find\nout for herself what the worst was.\n\nShe was the first woman outside, though the wails and shrieks swelled\nbelow, and half-dressed, ghastly creatures tumbled gasping up the\ncompanion-way.\n\n\"What is it?\" she heard. \"My God! what's happened? Where's the Captain!\nAre we going down! The boats! The boats!\"\n\nIt was useless to speak to the seamen rushing by. They did not see, much\nless hear! She caught sight of a man who could not be a sailor, since\nhe was standing still. She made her way to him, thankful that she had\nmanaged to stop her teeth chattering.\n\n\"What has happened to us?\" she said.\n\nHe turned and looked at her straitly. He was the second-cabin passenger\nwith the red hair.\n\n\"A tramp steamer has run into us in the fog,\" he answered.\n\n\"How much harm is done?\"\n\n\"They are trying to find out. I am standing here on the chance of\nhearing something. It is madness to ask any man questions.\"\n\nThey spoke to each other in short, sharp sentences, knowing there was no\ntime to lose.\n\n\"Are you horribly frightened?\" he asked.\n\nShe stamped her foot.\n\n\"I hate it--I hate it!\" she said, flinging out her hand towards the\nblack, heaving water. \"The plunge--the choking! No one could hate it\nmore. But I want to DO something!\"\n\nShe was turning away when he caught her hand and held her.\n\n\"Wait a second,\" he said. \"I hate it as much as you do, but I believe we\ntwo can keep our heads. Those who can do that may help, perhaps. Let us\ntry to quiet the people. As soon as I find out anything I will come to\nyour friends' stateroom. You are near the boats there. Then I shall go\nback to the second cabin. You work on your side and I'll work on mine.\nThat's all.\"\n\n\"Thank you. Tell the Worthingtons. I'm going to the saloon deck.\" She\nwas off as she spoke.\n\nUpon the stairway she found herself in the midst of a struggling\npanic-stricken mob, tripping over each other on the steps, and clutching\nat any garment nearest, to drag themselves up as they fell, or were on\nthe point of falling. Everyone was crying out in question and appeal.\n\nBettina stood still, a firm, tall obstacle, and clutched at the hysteric\nwoman who was hurled against her.\n\n\"I've been on deck,\" she said. \"A tramp steamer has run into us. No one\nhas time to answer questions. The first thing to do is to put on warm\nclothes and secure the life belts in case you need them.\"\n\nAt once everyone turned upon her as if she was an authority. She replied\nwith almost fierce determination to the torrent of words poured forth.\n\n\"I know nothing further--only that if one is not a fool one must make\nsure of clothes and belts.\"\n\n\"Quite right, Miss Vanderpoel,\" said one young man, touching his cap in\nnervous propitiation.\n\n\"Stop screaming,\" Betty said mercilessly to the woman. \"It's\nidiotic--the more noise you make the less chance you have. How can men\nkeep their wits among a mob of shrieking, mad women?\"\n\nThat the remote Miss Vanderpoel should have emerged from her luxurious\ncorner to frankly bully the lot of them was an excellent shock for the\ncrowd. Men, who had been in danger of losing their heads and becoming\nas uncontrolled as the women, suddenly realised the fact and pulled\nthemselves together. Bettina made her way at once to the Worthingtons'\nstaterooms.\n\nThere she found frenzy reigning. Blanche and Marie Worthington were\ndarting to and fro, dragging about first one thing and then another.\nThey were silly with fright, and dashed at, and dropped alternately,\nlife belts, shoes, jewel cases, and wraps, while they sobbed and cried\nout hysterically. \"Oh, what shall we do with mother! What shall we do!\"\n\nThe manners of Betty Vanderpoel's sharp schoolgirl days returned to her\nin full force. She seized Blanche by the shoulder and shook her.\n\n\"What a donkey you are!\" she said. \"Put on your clothes. There they\nare,\" pushing her to the place where they hung. \"Marie--dress yourself\nthis moment. We may be in no real danger at all.\"\n\n\"Do you think not! Oh, Betty!\" they wailed in concert. \"Oh, what shall\nwe do with mother!\"\n\n\"Where is your mother?\"\n\n\"She fainted--Louise----\"\n\nBetty was in Mrs. Worthington's cabin before they had finished speaking.\nThe poor woman had fainted, and struck her cheek against a chair. She\nlay on the floor in her nightgown, with blood trickling from a cut on\nher face. Her maid, Louise, was wringing her hands, and doing nothing\nwhatever.\n\n\"If you don't bring the brandy this minute,\" said the beautiful Miss\nVanderpoel, \"I'll box your ears. Believe me, my girl.\" She looked so\ncapable of doing it that the woman was startled and actually offended\ninto a return of her senses. Miss Vanderpoel had usually the best\npossible manners in dealing with her inferiors.\n\nBetty poured brandy down Mrs. Worthington's throat and applied strong\nsmelling salts until she gasped back to consciousness. She had just\nburst into frightened sobs, when Betty heard confusion and exclamations\nin the adjoining room. Blanche and Marie had cried out, and a man's\nvoice was speaking. Betty went to them. They were in various stages of\nundress, and the red-haired second-cabin passenger was standing at the\ndoor.\n\n\"I promised Miss Vanderpoel----\" he was saying, when Betty came forward.\nHe turned to her promptly.\n\n\"I come to tell you that it seems absolutely to be relied on that there\nis no immediate danger. The tramp is more injured than we are.\"\n\n\"Oh, are you sure? Are you sure?\" panted Blanche, catching at his\nsleeve.\n\n\"Yes,\" he answered. \"Can I do anything for you?\" he said to Bettina, who\nwas on the point of speaking.\n\n\"Will you be good enough to help me to assist Mrs. Worthington into her\nberth, and then try to find the doctor.\"\n\nHe went into the next room without speaking. To Mrs. Worthington he\nspoke briefly a few words of reassurance. He was a powerful man, and\nlaid her on her berth without dragging her about uncomfortably, or\nmaking her feel that her weight was greater than even in her most\ndesponding moments she had suspected. Even her helplessly hysteric mood\nwas illuminated by a ray of grateful appreciation.\n\n\"Oh, thank you--thank you,\" she murmured. \"And you are quite sure there\nis no actual danger, Mr.----?\"\n\n\"Salter,\" he terminated for her. \"You may feel safe. The damage is\nreally only slight, after all.\"\n\n\"It is so good of you to come and tell us,\" said the poor lady, still\ntremulous. \"The shock was awful. Our introduction has been an alarming\none. I--I don't think we have met during the voyage.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Salter. \"I am in the second cabin.\"\n\n\"Oh! thank you. It's so good of you,\" she faltered amiably, for want of\ninspiration. As he went out of the stateroom, Salter spoke to Bettina.\n\n\"I will send the doctor, if I can find him,\" he said. \"I think, perhaps,\nyou had better take some brandy yourself. I shall.\"\n\n\"It's queer how little one seems to realise even that there are\nsecond-cabin passengers,\" commented Mrs. Worthington feebly. \"That was a\nnice man, and perfectly respectable. He even had a kind of--of manner.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nLADY JANE GREY\n\nIt seemed upon the whole even absurd that after a shock so awful and a\npanic wild enough to cause people to expose their very souls--for\nthere were, of course, endless anecdotes to be related afterwards,\nillustrative of grotesque terror, cowardice, and utter abandonment\nof all shadows of convention--that all should end in an anticlimax of\ntrifling danger, upon which, in a day or two, jokes might be made. Even\nthe tramp steamer had not been seriously injured, though its injuries\nwere likely to be less easy of repair than those of the Meridiana.\n\n\"Still,\" as a passenger remarked, when she steamed into the dock at\nLiverpool, \"we might all be at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean\nthis morning. Just think what columns there would have been in the\nnewspapers. Imagine Miss Vanderpoel's being drowned.\"\n\n\"I was very rude to Louise, when I found her wringing her hands over\nyou, and I was rude to Blanche,\" Bettina said to Mrs. Worthington. \"In\nfact I believe I was rude to a number of people that night. I am rather\nashamed.\"\n\n\"You called me a donkey,\" said Blanche, \"but it was the best thing you\ncould have done. You frightened me into putting on my shoes, instead of\ntrying to comb my hair with them. It was startling to see you march into\nthe stateroom, the only person who had not been turned into a gibbering\nidiot. I know I was gibbering, and I know Marie was.\"\n\n\"We both gibbered at the red-haired man when he came in,\" said Marie.\n\"We clutched at him and gibbered together. Where is the red-haired man,\nBetty? Perhaps we made him ill. I've not seen him since that moment.\"\n\n\"He is in the second cabin, I suppose,\" Bettina answered, \"but I have\nnot seen him, either.\"\n\n\"We ought to get up a testimonial and give it to him, because he did\nnot gibber,\" said Blanche. \"He was as rude and as sensible as you were,\nBetty.\"\n\nThey did not see him again, in fact, at that time. He had reasons of his\nown for preferring to remain unseen. The truth was that the nearer his\napproach to his native shores, the nastier, he was perfectly conscious,\nhis temper became, and he did not wish to expose himself by any incident\nwhich might cause him stupidly and obviously to lose it.\n\nThe maid, Louise, however, recognised him among her companions in the\nthird-class carriage in which she travelled to town. To her mind, whose\nopinions were regulated by neatly arranged standards, he looked morose\nand shabbily dressed. Some of the other second-cabin passengers had made\nthemselves quite smart in various, not too distinguished ways. He had\nnot changed his dress at all, and the large valise upon the luggage\nrack was worn and battered as if with long and rough usage. The woman\nwondered a little if he would address her, and inquire after the health\nof her mistress. But, being an astute creature, she only wondered this\nfor an instant, the next she realised that, for one reason or another,\nit was clear that he was not of the tribe of second-rate persons who\npursue an accidental acquaintance with their superiors in fortune,\nthrough sociable interchange with their footmen or maids.\n\nWhen the train slackened its speed at the platform of the station, he\ngot up, reaching down his valise and leaving the carriage, strode to the\nnearest hansom cab, waving the porter aside.\n\n\"Charing Cross,\" he called out to the driver, jumped in, and was rattled\naway.\n\n. . . . .\n\nDuring the years which had passed since Rosalie Vanderpoel first came to\nLondon as Lady Anstruthers, numbers of huge luxurious hotels had grown\nup, principally, as it seemed, that Americans should swarm into them\nand live at an expense which reminded them of their native land. Such\nestablishments would never have been built for English people, whose\nhabit it is merely to \"stop\" at hotels, not to LIVE in them. The\ntendency of the American is to live in his hotel, even though his\nintention may be only to remain in it two days. He is accustomed to\ndoing himself extremely well in proportion to his resources, whether\nthey be great or small, and the comforts, as also the luxuries, he\nallows himself and his domestic appendages are in a proportion much\nhigher in its relation to these resources than it would be were he\nEnglish, French, German, or Italians. As a consequence, he expects, when\nhe goes forth, whether holiday-making or on business, that his hostelry\nshall surround him, either with holiday luxuries and gaiety, or with\nsuch lavishness of comfort as shall alleviate the wear and tear of\nbusiness cares and fatigues. The rich man demands something almost as\ngood as he has left at home, the man of moderate means something much\nbetter. Certain persons given to regarding public wants and desires as\nfoundations for the fortune of business schemes having discovered\nthis, the enormous and sumptuous hotel evolved itself from their astute\nknowledge of common facts. At the entrances of these hotels,\nomnibuses and cabs, laden with trunks and packages frequently\nbearing labels marked with red letters \"S. S. So-and-So,\nStateroom--Hold--Baggage-room,\" drew up and deposited their contents\nand burdens at regular intervals. Then men with keen, and often humorous\nfaces or almost painfully anxious ones, their exceedingly well-dressed\nwives, and more or less attractive and vivacious-looking daughters,\ntheir eager little girls, and un-English-looking little boys, passed\nthrough the corridors in flocks and took possession of suites of rooms,\nsometimes for twenty-four hours, sometimes for six weeks.\n\nThe Worthingtons took possession of such a suite in such a hotel.\nBettina Vanderpoel's apartments faced the Embankment. From her windows\nshe could look out at the broad splendid, muddy Thames, slowly rolling\nin its grave, stately way beneath its bridges, bearing with it heavy\nlumbering barges, excited tooting little penny steamers and craft\nof various shapes and sizes, the errand or burden of each meaning a\ndifferent story.\n\nIt had been to Bettina one of her pleasures of the finest epicurean\nflavour to reflect that she had never had any brief and superficial\nknowledge of England, as she had never been to the country at all in\nthose earlier years, when her knowledge of places must necessarily have\nbeen always the incomplete one of either a schoolgirl traveller or\na schoolgirl resident, whose views were limited by the walls of\nrestriction built around her.\n\nIf relations of the usual ease and friendliness had existed between Lady\nAnstruthers and her family, Bettina would, doubtless, have known her\nsister's adopted country well. It would have been a thing so natural\nas to be almost inevitable, that she would have crossed the Channel to\nspend her holidays at Stornham. As matters had stood, however, the child\nherself, in the days when she had been a child, had had most definite\nprivate views on the subject of visits to England. She had made up her\nyoung mind absolutely that she would not, if it were decently possible\nto avoid it, set her foot upon English soil until she was old enough\nand strong enough to carry out what had been at first her passionately\nromantic plans for discovering and facing the truth of the reason for\nthe apparent change in Rosy. When she went to England, she would go to\nRosy. As she had grown older, having in the course of education and\ntravel seen most Continental countries, she had liked to think that\nshe had saved, put aside for less hasty consumption and more delicate\nappreciation of flavours, as it were, the country she was conscious she\ncared for most.\n\n\"It is England we love, we Americans,\" she had said to her father. \"What\ncould be more natural? We belong to it--it belongs to us. I could never\nbe convinced that the old tie of blood does not count. All nationalities\nhave come to us since we became a nation, but most of us in the\nbeginning came from England. We are touching about it, too. We trifle\nwith France and labour with Germany, we sentimentalise over Italy and\necstacise over Spain--but England we love. How it moves us when we go\nto it, how we gush if we are simple and effusive, how we are stirred\nimaginatively if we are of the perceptive class. I have heard the\ncommonest little half-educated woman say the prettiest, clumsy,\nemotional things about what she has seen there. A New England\nschoolma'am, who has made a Cook's tour, will almost have tears in her\nvoice as she wanders on with her commonplaces about hawthorn hedges and\nthatched cottages and white or red farms. Why are we not unconsciously\npathetic about German cottages and Italian villas? Because we have not,\nin centuries past, had the habit of being born in them. It is only\nan English cottage and an English lane, whether white with hawthorn\nblossoms or bare with winter, that wakes in us that little yearning,\ngrovelling tenderness that is so sweet. It is only nature calling us\nhome.\"\n\nMrs. Worthington came in during the course of the morning to find her\nstanding before her window looking out at the Thames, the Embankment,\nthe hansom cabs themselves, with an absolutely serious absorption. This\nchanged to a smile as she turned to greet her.\n\n\"I am delighted,\" she said. \"I could scarcely tell you how much. The\nimpression is all new and I am excited a little by everything. I am so\nintensely glad that I have saved it so long and that I have known it\nonly as part of literature. I am even charmed that it rains, and that\nthe cabmen's mackintoshes are shining and wet.\" She drew forward a\nchair, and Mrs. Worthington sat down, looking at her with involuntary\nadmiration.\n\n\"You look as if you were delighted,\" she said. \"Your eyes--you have\namazing eyes, Betty! I am trying to picture to myself what Lady\nAnstruthers will feel when she sees you. What were you like when she\nmarried?\"\n\nBettina sat down, smiling and looking, indeed, quite incredibly lovely.\nShe was capable of a warmth and a sweetness which were as embracing as\nother qualities she possessed were powerful.\n\n\"I was eight years old,\" she said. \"I was a rude little girl, with\nlong legs and a high, determined voice. I know I was rude. I remember\nanswering back.\"\n\n\"I seem to have heard that you did not like your brother-in-law, and\nthat you were opposed to the marriage.\"\n\n\"Imagine the undisciplined audacity of a child of eight 'opposing' the\nmarriage of her grown-up sister. I was quite capable of it. You see in\nthose days we had not been trained at all (one had only been allowed\ntremendous liberty), and interfered conversationally with one's elders\nand betters at any moment. I was an American little girl, and American\nlittle girls were really--they really were!\" with a laugh, whose musical\nsound was after all wholly non-committal.\n\n\"You did not treat Sir Nigel Anstruthers as one of your betters.\"\n\n\"He was one of my elders, at all events, and becomingness of bearing\nshould have taught me to hold my little tongue. I am giving some thought\nnow to the kind of thing I must invent as a suitable apology when I find\nhim a really delightful person, full of virtues and accomplishments.\nPerhaps he has a horror of me.\"\n\n\"I should like to be present at your first meeting,\" Mrs. Worthington\nreflected. \"You are going down to Stornham to-morrow?\"\n\n\"That is my plan. When I write to you on my arrival, I will tell you if\nI encountered the horror.\" Then, with a swift change of subject and a\nlifting of her slender, velvet line of eyebrow, \"I am only deploring\nthat I have not time to visit the Tower.\"\n\nMrs. Worthington was betrayed into a momentary glance of uncertainty,\nalmost verging in its significance on a gasp.\n\n\"The Tower? Of London? Dear Betty!\"\n\nBettina's laugh was mellow with revelation.\n\n\"Ah!\" she said. \"You don't know my point of view; it's plain enough.\nYou see, when I delight in these things, I think I delight most in my\ndelight in them. It means that I am almost having the kind of feeling\nthe fresh American souls had who landed here thirty years ago and\nrevelled in the resemblance to Dickens's characters they met with in\nthe streets, and were historically thrilled by the places where people's\nheads were chopped off. Imagine their reflections on Charles I., when\nthey stood in Whitehall gazing on the very spot where that poor last\nword was uttered--'Remember.' And think of their joy when each crossing\nsweeper they gave disproportionate largess to, seemed Joe All Alones in\nthe slightest disguise.\"\n\n\"You don't mean to say----\" Mrs. Worthington was vaguely awakening to\nthe situation.\n\n\"That the charm of my visit, to myself, is that I realise that I am\nrather like that. I have positively preserved something because I have\nkept away. You have been here so often and know things so well, and you\nwere even so sophisticated when you began, that you have never really\nhad the flavours and emotions. I am sophisticated, too, sophisticated\nenough to have cherished my flavours as a gourmet tries to save the\nbouquet of old wine. You think that the Tower is the pleasure of\nhousemaids on a Bank Holiday. But it quite makes me quiver to think\nof it,\" laughing again. \"That I laugh, is the sign that I am not\nas beautifully, freshly capable of enjoyment as those genuine first\nAmericans were, and in a way I am sorry for it.\"\n\nMrs. Worthington laughed also, and with an enjoyment.\n\n\"You are very clever, Betty,\" she said.\n\n\"No, no,\" answered Bettina, \"or, if I am, almost everybody is clever in\nthese days. We are nearly all of us comparatively intelligent.\"\n\n\"You are very interesting at all events, and the Anstruthers will exult\nin you. If they are dull in the country, you will save them.\"\n\n\"I am very interested, at all events,\" said Bettina, \"and interest like\nmine is quite passe. A clever American who lives in England, and is the\npet of duchesses, once said to me (he always speaks of Americans as if\nthey were a distant and recently discovered species), 'When they first\ncame over they were a novelty. Their enthusiasm amused people, but now,\nyou see, it has become vieux jeu. Young women, whose specialty was to be\nexcited by the Tower of London and Westminster Abbey, are not novelties\nany longer. In fact, it's been done, and it's done FOR as a specialty.'\nAnd I am excited about the Tower of London. I may be able to restrain\nmy feelings at the sight of the Beef Eaters, but they will upset me a\nlittle, and I must brace myself, I must indeed.\"\n\n\"Truly, Betty?\" said Mrs. Worthington, regarding her with curiosity,\narising from a faint doubt of her entire seriousness, mingled with a\nfainter doubt of her entire levity.\n\nBetty flung out her hands in a slight, but very involuntary-looking,\ngesture, and shook her head.\n\n\"Ah!\" she said, \"it was all TRUE, you know. They were all horribly\nreal--the things that were shuddered over and sentimentalised about.\nSophistication, combined with imagination, makes them materialise again,\nto me, at least, now I am here. The gulf between a historical figure and\na man or woman who could bleed and cry out in human words was broad when\none was at school. Lady Jane Grey, for instance, how nebulous she was\nand how little one cared. She seemed invented merely to add a detail\nto one's lesson in English history. But, as we drove across Waterloo\nBridge, I caught a glimpse of the Tower, and what do you suppose I began\nto think of? It was monstrous. I saw a door in the Tower and the stone\nsteps, and the square space, and in the chill clear, early morning a\nlittle slender, helpless girl led out, a little, fair, real thing like\nRosy, all alone--everyone she belonged to far away, not a man near\nwho dared utter a word of pity when she turned her awful, meek, young,\ndesperate eyes upon him. She was a pious child, and, no doubt, she\nlifted her eyes to the sky. I wonder if it was blue and its blueness\nbroke her heart, because it looked as if it might have pitied such a\nyoung, patient girl thing led out in the fair morning to walk to the\nhacked block and give her trembling pardon to the black-visored man with\nthe axe, and then 'commending her soul to God' to stretch her sweet slim\nneck out upon it.\"\n\n\"Oh, Betty, dear!\" Mrs. Worthington expostulated.\n\nBettina sprang to her and took her hand in pretty appeal.\n\n\"I beg pardon! I beg pardon, I really do,\" she exclaimed. \"I did\nnot intend deliberately to be painful. But that--beneath the\nsophistication--is something of what I bring to England.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\"IS LADY ANSTRUTHERS AT HOME?\"\n\nAll that she had brought with her to England, combined with what she had\ncalled \"sophistication,\" but which was rather her exquisite appreciation\nof values and effects, she took with her when she went the next day to\nCharing Cross Station and arranged herself at her ease in the railway\ncarriage, while her maid bought their tickets for Stornham.\n\nWhat the people in the station saw, the guards and porters, the men in\nthe book stalls, the travellers hurrying past, was a striking-looking\ngirl, whose colouring and carriage made one turn to glance after her,\nand who, having bought some periodicals and papers, took her place in a\nfirst-class compartment and watched the passersby interestedly through\nthe open window. Having been looked at and remarked on during her\nwhole life, Bettina did not find it disturbing that more than one\ncorduroy-clothed porter and fresh-coloured, elderly gentleman, or\nfreshly attired young one, having caught a glimpse of her through her\nwindow, made it convenient to saunter past or hover round. She looked\nat them much more frankly than they looked at her. To her they were all\nspecimens of the types she was at present interested in. For practical\nreasons she was summing up English character with more deliberate\nintention than she had felt in the years when she had gradually learned\nto know Continental types and differentiate such peculiarities as were\nsignificant of their ranks and nations. As the first Reuben Vanderpoel\nhad studied the countenances and indicative methods of the inhabitants\nof the new parts of the country in which it was his intention to\ndo business, so the modernity of his descendant applied itself to\nobservation for reasons parallel in nature though not in actual kind.\nAs he had brought beads and firewater to bear as agents upon savages\nwho would barter for them skins and products which might be turned into\nmoney, so she brought her nineteenth-century beauty, steadfastness of\npurpose and alertness of brain to bear upon the matter the practical\ndealing with which was the end she held in view. To bear herself in this\nmatter with as practical a control of situations as that with which\nher great-grandfather would have borne himself in making a trade with a\npreviously unknown tribe of Indians was quite her intention, though it\nhad not occurred to her to put it to herself in any such form. Still,\nwhether she was aware of the fact or not, her point of view was exactly\nwhat the first Reuben Vanderpoel's had been on many very different\noccasions. She had before her the task of dealing with facts and factors\nof which at present she knew but little. Astuteness of perception,\nself-command, and adaptability were her chief resources. She was ready,\neither for calm, bold approach, or equally calm and wholly non-committal\nretreat.\n\nThe perceptions she had brought with her filled her journey into Kent\nwith delicious things, delicious recognition of beauties she had before\nknown the existence of only through the reading of books, and the\ndwelling upon their charms as reproduced, more or less perfectly,\non canvas. She saw roll by her, with the passing of the train, the\nloveliness of land and picturesqueness of living which she had saved\nfor herself with epicurean intention for years. Her fancy, when detached\nfrom her thoughts of her sister, had been epicurean, and she had been\nquite aware that it was so. When she had left the suburbs and those\nvillages already touched with suburbanity behind, she felt herself\nsettle into a glow of luxurious enjoyment in the freshness of\nher pleasure in the familiar, and yet unfamiliar, objects in the\nthick-hedged fields, whose broad-branched, thick-foliaged oaks and\nbeeches were more embowering in their shade, and sweeter in their green\nthan anything she remembered that other countries had offered her,\neven at their best. Within the fields the hawthorn hedges beautifully\nenclosed were groups of resigned mother sheep with their young lambs\nabout them. The curious pointed tops of the red hopkilns, piercing the\ntrees near the farmhouses, wore an almost intentional air of adding\npicturesque detail. There were clusters of old buildings and dots\nof cottages and cottage gardens which made her now and then utter\nexclamations of delight. Little inarticulate Rosy had seen and felt it\nall twelve years before on her hopeless bridal home-coming when Nigel\nhad sat huddled unbecomingly in the corner of the railway carriage. Her\npower of expression had been limited to little joyful gasps and obvious\nlaudatory adjectives, smothered in their birth by her first glance at\nher bridegroom. Betty, in seeing it, knew all the exquisiteness of her\nown pleasure, and all the meanings of it.\n\nYes, it was England--England. It was the England of Constable and\nMorland, of Miss Mitford and Miss Austen, the Brontes and George Eliot.\nThe land which softly rolled and clothed itself in the rich verdure of\nmany trees, sometimes in lovely clusters, sometimes in covering copse,\nwas Constable's; the ripe young woman with the fat-legged children\nand the farmyard beasts about her, as she fed the hens from the wooden\npiggin under her arm, was Morland's own. The village street might be\nMiss Mitford's, the well-to-do house Jane Austen's own fancy, in its\nwarm brick and comfortable decorum. She laughed a little as she thought\nit.\n\n\"That is American,\" she said, \"the habit of comparing every stick\nand stone and breathing thing to some literary parallel. We almost\ninvariably say that things remind us of pictures or books--most usually\nbooks. It seems a little crude, but perhaps it means that we are an\nintensely literary and artistic people.\"\n\nShe continued to find comparisons revealing to her their appositeness,\nuntil her journey had ended by the train's slackening speed and coming\nto a standstill before the rural-looking little station which had\npresented its quaint aspect to Lady Anstruthers on her home-coming of\nyears before.\n\nIt had not, during the years which certainly had given time for change,\naltered in the least. The station master had grown stouter and more\nrosy, and came forward with his respectful, hospitable air, to attend to\nthe unusual-looking young lady, who was the only first-class passenger.\nHe thought she must be a visitor expected at some country house, but\nnone of the carriages, whose coachmen were his familiar acquaintances,\nwere in waiting. That such a fine young lady should be paying a visit\nat any house whose owners did not send an equipage to attend her coming,\nstruck him as unusual. The brougham from the \"Crown,\" though a decent\ncountry town vehicle, seemed inadequate. Yet, there it stood drawn up\noutside the station, and she went to it with the manner of a young lady\nwho had ordered its attendance and knew it would be there.\n\nWells felt a good deal of interest. Among the many young ladies who\ndescended from the first-class compartments and passed through the\nlittle waiting-room on their way to the carriages of the gentry they\nwere going to visit, he did not know when a young lady had \"caught his\neye,\" so to speak, as this one did. She was not exactly the kind of\nyoung lady one would immediately class mentally as \"a foreigner,\" but\nthe blue of her eyes was so deep, and her hair and eyelashes so dark,\nthat these things, combining themselves with a certain \"way\" she had,\nmade him feel her to be of a type unfamiliar to the region, at least.\n\nHe was struck, also, by the fact that the young lady had no maid with\nher. The truth was that Bettina had purposely left her maid in town. If\nawkward things occurred, the presence of an attendant would be a sort\nof complication. It was better, on the first approach, to be wholly\nunencumbered.\n\n\"How far are we from Stornham Court?\" she inquired.\n\n\"Five miles, my lady,\" he answered, touching his cap. She expressed\nsomething which to the rural and ingenuous, whose standards were\ndefined, demanded a recognition of probable rank.\n\n\"I'd like to know,\" was his comment to his wife when he went home to\ndinner, \"who has gone to Stornham Court to-day. There's few enough\nvisitors go there, and none such as her, for certain. She don't live\nanywhere on the line above here, either, for I've never seen her face\nbefore. She was a tall, handsome one--she was, but it isn't just that\nmade you look after her. She was a clever one with a spirit, I'll be\nbound. I was wondering what her ladyship would have to say to her.\"\n\n\"Perhaps she was one of HIS fine ladies?\" suggestively.\n\n\"That she wasn't, either. And, as for that, I wonder what he'd have to\nsay to such as she is.\"\n\nThere was complexity of element enough in the thing she was on her way\nto do, Bettina was thinking, as she was driven over the white ribbon\nof country road that unrolled over rise and hollow, between the\nsheep-dotted greenness of fields and the scented hedges. The soft beauty\nenclosing her was a little shut out from her by her mental attitude. She\nbrought forward for her own decisions upon suitable action a number of\npossible situations she might find herself called upon to confront.\nThe one thing necessary was that she should be prepared for anything\nwhatever, even for Rosy's not being pleased to see her, or for finding\nSir Nigel a thoroughly reformed and amiable character.\n\n\"It is the thing which seemingly CANNOT happen which one is most likely\nto find one's self face to face with. It will be a little awkward to\narrange, if he has developed every domestic virtue, and is delighted to\nsee me.\"\n\nUnder such rather confusing conditions her plan would be to present to\nthem, as an affectionate surprise, the unheralded visit, which might\nappear a trifle uncalled for. She felt happily sure of herself under any\ncircumstances not partaking of the nature of collisions at sea. Yet she\nhad not behaved absolutely ill at the time of the threatened catastrophe\nin the Meridiana. Her remembrance, an oddly sudden one, of the definite\nmanner of the red-haired second-class passenger, assured her of that. He\nhad certainly had all his senses about him, and he had spoken to her as\na person to be counted on.\n\nHer pulse beat a little more hurriedly as the brougham entered Stornham\nvillage. It was picturesque, but struck her as looking neglected. Many\nof the cottages had an air of dilapidation. There were many broken\nwindows and unmended garden palings. A suggested lack of whitewash in\nseveral cases was not cheerful.\n\n\"I know nothing of the duties of English landlords,\" she said, looking\nthrough her carriage window, \"but I should do it myself, if I were\nRosy.\"\n\nShe saw, as she was taken through the park gateway, that that structure\nwas out of order, and that damaged diamond panes peered out from under\nthe thickness of the ivy massing itself over the lodge.\n\n\"Ah!\" was her thought, \"it does not promise as it should. Happy people\ndo not let things fall to pieces.\"\n\nEven winding avenue, and spreading sward, and gorse, and broom, and\nbracken, enfolding all the earth beneath huge trees, were not fair\nenough to remove a sudden remote fear which arose in her rapidly\nreasoning mind. It suggested to her a point of view so new that, while\nshe was amazed at herself for not having contemplated it before, she\nfound herself wishing that the coachman would drive rather more slowly,\nactually that she might have more time to reflect.\n\nThey were nearing a dip in the park, where there was a lonely looking\npool. The bracken was thick and high there, and the sun, which had just\nbroken through a cloud, had pierced the trees with a golden gleam.\n\nA little withdrawn from this shaft of brightness stood two figures, a\ndowdy little woman and a hunchbacked boy. The woman held some ferns\nin her hand, and the boy was sitting down and resting his chin on his\nhands, which were folded on the top of a stick.\n\n\"Stop here for a moment,\" Bettina said to the coachman. \"I want to ask\nthat woman a question.\"\n\nShe had thought that she might discover if her sister was at the Court.\nShe realised that to know would be a point of advantage. She leaned\nforward and spoke.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" she said, \"I wonder if you can tell me----\"\n\nThe woman came forward a little. She had a listless step and a faded,\nlistless face.\n\n\"What did you ask?\" she said.\n\nBetty leaned still further forward.\n\n\"Can you tell me----\" she began and stopped. A sense of stricture in\nthe throat stopped her, as her eyes took in the washed-out colour of\nthe thin face, the washed-out colour of the thin hair--thin drab hair,\ndragged in straight, hard unbecomingness from the forehead and cheeks.\n\nWas it true that her heart was thumping, as she had heard it said that\nagitation made hearts thump?\n\nShe began again.\n\n\"Can you--tell me if--Lady Anstruthers is at home?\" she inquired. As she\nsaid it she felt the blood surge up from the furious heart, and the\nhand she had laid on the handle of the door of the brougham clutched it\ninvoluntarily.\n\nThe dowdy little woman answered her indifferently, staring at her a\nlittle.\n\n\"I am Lady Anstruthers,\" she said.\n\nBettina opened the carriage door and stood upon the ground.\n\n\"Go on to the house,\" she gave order to the coachman, and, with a\nsomewhat startled look, he drove away.\n\n\"Rosy!\" Bettina's voice was a hushed, almost awed, thing. \"YOU are\nRosy?\"\n\nThe faded little wreck of a creature began to look frightened.\n\n\"Rosy!\" she repeated, with a small, wry, painful smile.\n\nShe was the next moment held in the folding of strong, young arms,\nagainst a quickly beating heart. She was being wildly kissed, and the\nvery air seemed rich with warmth and life.\n\n\"I am Betty,\" she heard. \"Look at me, Rosy! I am Betty. Look at me and\nremember!\"\n\nLady Anstruthers gasped, and broke into a faint, hysteric laugh. She\nsuddenly clutched at Bettina's arm. For a minute her gaze was wild as\nshe looked up.\n\n\"Betty,\" she cried out. \"No! No! No! I can't believe it! I can't! I\ncan't!\"\n\nThat just this thing could have taken place in her, Bettina had\nnever thought. As she had reflected on her way from the station, the\nimpossible is what one finds one's self face to face with. Twelve years\nshould not have changed a pretty blonde thing of nineteen to a worn,\nunintelligent-looking dowdy of the order of dowdiness which seems to\nhave lived beyond age and sex. She looked even stupid, or at least\nstupefied. At this moment she was a silly, middle-aged woman, who did\nnot know what to do. For a few seconds Bettina wondered if she was glad\nto see her, or only felt awkward and unequal to the situation.\n\n\"I can't believe you,\" she cried out again, and began to shiver. \"Betty!\nLittle Betty? No! No! it isn't!\"\n\nShe turned to the boy, who had lifted his chin from his stick, and was\nstaring.\n\n\"Ughtred! Ughtred!\" she called to him. \"Come! She says--she says----\"\n\nShe sat down upon a clump of heather and began to cry. She hid her face\nin her spare hands and broke into sobbing.\n\n\"Oh, Betty! No!\" she gasped. \"It's so long ago--it's so far away. You\nnever came--no one--no one--came!\"\n\nThe hunchbacked boy drew near. He had limped up on his stick. He spoke\nlike an elderly, affectionate gnome, not like a child.\n\n\"Don't do that, mother,\" he said. \"Don't let it upset you so, whatever\nit is.\"\n\n\"It's so long ago; it's so far away!\" she wept, with catches in her\nbreath and voice. \"You never came!\"\n\nBetty knelt down and enfolded her again. Her bell-like voice was firm\nand clear.\n\n\"I have come now,\" she said. \"And it is not far away. A cable will reach\nfather in two hours.\"\n\nPursuing a certain vivid thought in her mind, she looked at her watch.\n\n\"If you spoke to mother by cable this moment,\" she added, with\naccustomed coolness, and she felt her sister actually start as she\nspoke, \"she could answer you by five o'clock.\"\n\nLady Anstruther's start ended in a laugh and gasp more hysteric than her\nfirst. There was even a kind of wan awakening in her face, as she lifted\nit to look at the wonderful newcomer. She caught her hand and held it,\ntrembling, as she weakly laughed.\n\n\"It must be Betty,\" she cried. \"That little stern way! It is so like\nher. Betty--Betty--dear!\" She fell into a sobbing, shaken heap upon\nthe heather. The harrowing thought passed through Betty's mind that she\nlooked almost like a limp bundle of shabby clothes. She was so helpless\nin her pathetic, apologetic hysteria.\n\n\"I shall--be better,\" she gasped. \"It's nothing. Ughtred, tell her.\"\n\n\"She's very weak, really,\" said the boy Ughtred, in his mature way. \"She\ncan't help it sometimes. I'll get some water from the pool.\"\n\n\"Let me go,\" said Betty, and she darted down to the water. She was\nback in a moment. The boy was rubbing and patting his mother's hands\ntenderly.\n\n\"At any rate,\" he remarked, as one consoled by a reflection, \"father is\nnot at home.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\"I THOUGHT YOU HAD ALL FORGOTTEN.\"\n\nAs, after a singular half hour spent among the bracken under the trees,\nthey began their return to the house, Bettina felt that her sense of\nadventure had altered its character. She was still in the midst of a\nremarkable sort of exploit, which might end anywhere or in anything,\nbut it had become at once more prosaic in detail and more intense in its\nsignificance. What its significance might prove likely to be when\nshe faced it, she had not known, it is true. But this was different\nfrom--from anything. As they walked up the sun-dappled avenue she kept\nglancing aside at Rosy, and endeavouring to draw useful conclusions. The\npoor girl's air of being a plain, insignificant frump, long past youth,\nstruck an extraordinary and, for the time, unexplainable note. Her\nill-cut, out-of-date dress, the cheap suit of the hunchbacked boy,\nwho limped patiently along, helped by his crutch, suggested possible\nexplanations which were without doubt connected with the thought\nwhich had risen in Bettina's mind, as she had been driven through the\nbroken-hinged entrance gate. What extraordinary disposal was being\nmade of Rosy's money? But her each glance at her sister also suggested\ncomplication upon complication.\n\nThe singular half hour under the trees by the pool, spent, after the\nfirst hysteric moments were over, in vague exclaimings and questions,\nwhich seemed half frightened and all at sea, had gradually shown her\nthat she was talking to a creature wholly other than the Rosalie who had\nso well known and loved them all, and whom they had so well loved and\nknown. They did not know this one, and she did not know them, she was\neven a little afraid of the stir and movement of their life and being.\nThe Rosy they had known seemed to be imprisoned within the wall the\nyears of her separated life had built about her. At each breath she drew\nBettina saw how long the years had been to her, and how far her home had\nseemed to lie away, so far that it could not touch her, and was only\na sort of dream, the recalling of which made her suddenly begin to cry\nagain every few minutes. To Bettina's sensitively alert mind it was\nplain that it would not do in the least to drag her suddenly out of her\nprison, or cloister, whichsoever it might be. To do so would be like\nforcing a creature accustomed only to darkness, to stare at the blazing\nsun. To have burst upon her with the old impetuous, candid fondness\nwould have been to frighten and shock her as if with something bordering\non indecency. She could not have stood it; perhaps such fondness was\nso remote from her in these days that she had even ceased to be able to\nunderstand it.\n\n\"Where are your little girls?\" Bettina asked, remembering that there had\nbeen notice given of the advent of two girl babies.\n\n\"They died,\" Lady Anstruthers answered unemotionally. \"They both died\nbefore they were a year old. There is only Ughtred.\"\n\nBetty glanced at the boy and saw a small flame of red creep up on his\ncheek. Instinctively she knew what it meant, and she put out her hand\nand lightly touched his shoulder.\n\n\"I hope you'll like me, Ughtred,\" she said.\n\nHe almost started at the sound of her voice, but when he turned his face\ntowards her he only grew redder, and looked awkward without answering.\nHis manner was that of a boy who was unused to the amenities of polite\nsociety, and who was only made shy by them.\n\nWithout warning, a moment or so later, Bettina stopped in the middle\nof the avenue, and looked up at the arching giant branches of the trees\nwhich had reached out from one side to the other, as if to clasp hands\nor encompass an interlacing embrace. As far as the eye reached, they did\nthis, and the beholder stood as in a high stately pergola, with breaks\nof deep azure sky between. Several mellow, cawing rooks were floating\nsolemnly beneath or above the branches, now wand then settling in some\nhighest one or disappearing in the thick greenness.\n\nLady Anstruthers stopped when her sister did so, and glanced at her in\nvague inquiry. It was plain that she had outlived even her sense of the\nbeauty surrounding her.\n\n\"What are you looking at, Betty?\" she asked.\n\n\"At all of it,\" Betty answered. \"It is so wonderful.\"\n\n\"She likes it,\" said Ughtred, and then rather slunk a step behind his\nmother, as if he were ashamed of himself.\n\n\"The house is just beyond those trees,\" said Lady Anstruthers.\n\nThey came in full view of it three minutes later. When she saw it, Betty\nuttered an exclamation and stopped again to enjoy effects.\n\n\"She likes that, too,\" said Ughtred, and, although he said it\nsheepishly, there was imperfectly concealed beneath the awkwardness a\npleasure in the fact.\n\n\"Do you?\" asked Rosalie, with her small, painful smile.\n\nBetty laughed.\n\n\"It is too picturesque, in its special way, to be quite credible,\" she\nsaid.\n\n\"I thought that when I first saw it,\" said Rosy.\n\n\"Don't you think so, now?\"\n\n\"Well,\" was the rather uncertain reply, \"as Nigel says, there's not much\ngood in a place that is falling to pieces.\"\n\n\"Why let it fall to pieces?\" Betty put it to her with impartial\npromptness.\n\n\"We haven't money enough to hold it together,\" resignedly.\n\nAs they climbed the low, broad, lichen-blotched steps, whose broken\nstone balustrades were almost hidden in clutching, untrimmed ivy, Betty\nfelt them to be almost incredible, too. The uneven stones of the terrace\nthe steps mounted to were lichen-blotched and broken also. Tufts of\ngreen growths had forced themselves between the flags, and added an\nuntidy beauty. The ivy tossed in branches over the red roof and walls of\nthe house. It had been left unclipped, until it was rather an endlessly\nclambering tree than a creeper. The hall they entered had the beauty\nof spacious form and good, old oaken panelling. There were deep window\nseats and an ancient high-backed settle or so, and a massive table by\nthe fireless hearth. But there were no pictures in places where pictures\nhad evidently once hung, and the only coverings on the stone floor were\nthe faded remnants of a central rug and a worn tiger skin, the head\nalmost bald and a glass eye knocked out.\n\nBettina took in the unpromising details without a quiver of the\nextravagant lashes. These, indeed, and the eyes pertaining to them,\nseemed rather to sweep the fine roof, and a certain minstrel's gallery\nand staircase, than which nothing could have been much finer, with the\nlook of an appreciative admirer of architectural features and old oak.\nShe had not journeyed to Stornham Court with the intention of disturbing\nRosy, or of being herself obviously disturbed. She had come to\nobserve situations and rearrange them with that intelligence of which\nunconsidered emotion or exclamation form no part.\n\n\"It is the first old English house I have seen,\" she said, with a sigh\nof pleasure. \"I am so glad, Rosy--I am so glad that it is yours.\"\n\nShe put a hand on each of Rosy's thin shoulders--she felt sharply\ndefined bones as she did so--and bent to kiss her. It was the natural\naffectionate expression of her feeling, but tears started to Rosy's\neyes, and the boy Ughtred, who had sat down in a window seat, turned red\nagain, and shifted in his place.\n\n\"Oh, Betty!\" was Rosy's faint nervous exclamation, \"you seem so\nbeautiful and--so--so strange--that you frighten me.\"\n\nBetty laughed with the softest possible cheerfulness, shaking her a\nlittle.\n\n\"I shall not seem strange long,\" she said, \"after I have stayed with you\na few weeks, if you will let me stay with you.\"\n\n\"Let you! Let you!\" in a sort of gasp.\n\nPoor little Lady Anstruthers sank on to a settle and began to cry again.\nIt was plain that she always cried when things occurred. Ughtred's\nspeech from his window seat testified at once to that.\n\n\"Don't cry, mother,\" he said. \"You know how we've talked that over\ntogether. It's her nerves,\" he explained to Bettina. \"We know it only\nmakes things worse, but she can't stop it.\"\n\nBettina sat on the settle, too. She herself was not then aware of the\nwonderful feeling the poor little spare figure experienced, as her\nsoftly strong young arms curved about it. She was only aware that she\nherself felt that this was a heart-breaking thing, and that she must\nnot--MUST not let it be seen how much she recognised its woefulness.\nThis was pretty, fair Rosy, who had never done a harm in her happy\nlife--this forlorn thing was her Rosy.\n\n\"Never mind,\" she said, half laughing again. \"I rather want to cry\nmyself, and I am stronger than she is. I am immensely strong.\"\n\n\"Yes! Yes!\" said Lady Anstruthers, wiping her eyes, and making a\ntremendous effort at self-respecting composure. \"You are strong. I have\ngrown so weak in--well, in every way. Betty, I'm afraid this is a poor\nwelcome. You see--I'm afraid you'll find it all so different from--from\nNew York.\"\n\n\"I wanted to find it different,\" said Betty.\n\n\"But--but--I mean--you know----\" Lady Anstruthers turned helplessly to\nthe boy. Bettina was struck with the painful truth that she looked even\nsilly as she turned to him. \"Ughtred--tell her,\" she ended, and hung her\nhead.\n\nUghtred had got down at once from his seat and limped forward. His\nunprepossessing face looked as if he pulled his childishness together\nwith an unchildish effort.\n\n\"She means,\" he said, in his awkward way, \"that she doesn't know how\nto make you comfortable. The rooms are all so shabby--everything is so\nshabby. Perhaps you won't stay when you see.\"\n\nBettina perceptibly increased the firmness of her hold on her sister's\nbody. It was as if she drew it nearer to her side in a kind of taking\npossession. She knew that the moment had come when she might go this\nfar, at least, without expressing alarming things.\n\n\"You cannot show me anything that will frighten me,\" was the answer\nshe made. \"I have come to stay, Rosy. We can make things right if they\nrequire it. Why not?\"\n\nLady Anstruthers started a little, and stared at her. She knew ten\nthousand reasons why things had not been made right, and the casual\ninference that such reasons could be lightly swept away as if by the\nmere wave of a hand, implied a power appertaining to a time seeming so\nlost forever that it was too much for her.\n\n\"Oh, Betty, Betty!\" she cried, \"you talk as if--you are so----!\"\n\nThe fact, so simple to the members of the abnormal class to which she of\na truth belonged, the class which heaped up its millions, the absolute\nknowledge that there was a great deal of money in the world and that she\nwas of those who were among its chief owners, had ceased to seem a fact,\nand had vanished into the region of fairy stories.\n\nThat she could not believe it a reality revealed itself to Bettina, as\nby a flash, which was also a revelation of many things. There would be\nunpleasing truths to be learned, and she had not made her pilgrimage for\nnothing. But--in any event--there were advantages without doubt in the\ncircumstance which subjected one to being perpetually pointed out as a\ndaughter of a multi-millionaire. As this argued itself out for her with\nrapid lucidity, she bent and kissed Rosy once more. She even tried to\ndo it lightly, and not to allow the rush of love and pity in her soul to\nbetray her.\n\n\"I talk as if--as if I were Betty,\" she said. \"You have forgotten. I\nhave not. I have been looking forward to this for years. I have been\nplanning to come to you since I was eleven years old. And here we sit.\"\n\n\"You didn't forget? You didn't?\" faltered the poor wreck of Rosy. \"Oh!\nOh! I thought you had all forgotten me--quite--quite!\"\n\nAnd her face went down in her spare, small hands, and she began to cry\nagain.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nUGHTRED\n\nBettina stood alone in her bedroom a couple of hours later. Lady\nAnstruthers had taken her to it, preparing her for its limitations by\nexplaining that she would find it quite different from her room in\nNew York. She had been pathetically nervous and flushed about it, and\nBettina had also been aware that the apartment itself had been hastily,\nand with much moving of objects from one chamber to another, made ready\nfor her.\n\nThe room was large and square and low. It was panelled in small squares\nof white wood. The panels were old enough to be cracked here and there,\nand the paint was stained and yellow with time, where it was not knocked\nor worn off. There was a small paned, leaded window which filled a\nlarge part of one side of the room, and its deep seat was an agreeable\nfeature. Sitting in it, one looked out over several red-walled gardens,\nand through breaks in the trees of the park to a fair beyond. Bettina\nstood before this window for a few moments, and then took a seat in the\nembrasure, that she might gaze out and reflect at leisure.\n\nHer genius, as has before been mentioned, was the genius for living,\nfor being vital. Many people merely exist, are kept alive by others, or\ncontinue to vegetate because the persistent action of normal functions\nwill allow of their doing no less. Bettina Vanderpoel had lived vividly,\nand in the midst of a self-created atmosphere of action from her\nfirst hour. It was not possible for her to be one of the horde of mere\nspectators. Wheresoever she moved there was some occult stirring of the\nmental, and even physical, air. Her pulses beat too strongly, her blood\nran too fast to allow of inaction of mind or body. When, in passing\nthrough the village, she had seen the broken windows and the hanging\npalings of the cottages, it had been inevitable that, at once, she\nshould, in thought, repair them, set them straight. Disorder filled her\nwith a sort of impatience which was akin to physical distress. If she\nhad been born a poor woman she would have worked hard for her living,\nand found an interest, almost an exhilaration, in her labour. Such gifts\nas she had would have been applied to the tasks she undertook. It had\nfrequently given her pleasure to imagine herself earning her livelihood\nas a seamstress, a housemaid, a nurse. She knew what she could have put\ninto her service, and how she could have found it absorbing. Imagination\nand initiative could make any service absorbing. The actual truth was\nthat if she had been a housemaid, the room she set in order would have\ntaken a character under her touch; if she had been a seamstress, her\nwork would have been swiftly done, her imagination would have invented\nfor her combinations of form and colour; if she had been a nursemaid,\nthe children under her care would never have been sufficiently bored\nto become tiresome or intractable, and they also would have gained\ncharacter to which would have been added an undeniable vividness of\noutlook. She could not have left them alone, so to speak. In obeying the\nmere laws of her being, she would have stimulated them. Unconsciously\nshe had stimulated her fellow pupils at school; when she was his\ncompanion, her father had always felt himself stirred to interest and\nenterprise.\n\n\"You ought to have been a man, Betty,\" he used to say to her sometimes.\n\nBut Betty had not agreed with him.\n\n\"You say that,\" she once replied to him, \"because you see I am inclined\nto do things, to change them, if they need changing. Well, one is either\nborn like that, or one is not. Sometimes I think that perhaps the people\nwho must ACT are of a distinct race. A kind of vigorous restlessness\ndrives them. I remember that when I was a child I could not see a pin\nlying upon the ground without picking it up, or pass a drawer which\nneeded closing, without giving it a push. But there has always been as\nmuch for women to do as for men.\"\n\nThere was much to be done here of one sort of thing and another. That\nwas certain. As she gazed through the small panes of her large windows,\nshe found herself overlooking part of a wilderness of garden, which\nrevealed itself through an arch in an overgrown laurel hedge. She had\nglimpses of unkempt grass paths and unclipped topiary work which had\nlost its original form. Among a tangle of weeds rose the heads of clumps\nof daffodils, stirred by a passing wind of spring. In the park beyond a\ncuckoo was calling.\n\nShe was conscious both of the forlorn beauty and significance of the\nneglected garden, and of the clear quaintness of the cuckoo call, as she\nthought of other things.\n\n\"Her spirit and her health are broken,\" was her summing up. \"Her\nprettiness has faded to a rag. She is as nervous as an ill-treated\nchild. She has lost her wits. I do not know where to begin with her.\nI must let her tell me things as gradually as she chooses. Until I see\nNigel I shall not know what his method with her has been. She looks as\nif she had ceased to care for things, even for herself. What shall I\nwrite to mother?\"\n\nShe knew what she should write to her father. With him she could be\nexplicit. She could record what she had found and what it suggested\nto her. She could also make clear her reason for hesitance and\ndeliberation. His discretion and affection would comprehend the thing\nwhich she herself felt and which affection not combined with discretion\nmight not take in. He would understand, when she told him that one of\nthe first things which had struck her, had been that Rosy herself, her\nhelplessness and timidity, might, for a period at least, form obstacles\nin their path of action. He not only loved Rosy, but realised how slight\na sweet thing she had always been, and he would know how far a slight\ncreature's gentleness might be overpowered and beaten down.\n\nThere was so much that her mother must be spared, there was indeed\nso little that it would be wise to tell her, that Bettina sat gently\nrubbing her forehead as she thought of it. The truth was that she must\ntell her nothing, until all was over, accomplished, decided. Whatsoever\nthere was to be \"over,\" whatsoever the action finally taken, must be\na matter lying as far as possible between her father and herself. Mrs.\nVanderpoel's trouble would be too keen, her anxiety too great to keep to\nherself, even if she were not overwhelmed by them. She must be told of\nthe beauties and dimensions of Stornham, all relatable details of Rosy's\nlife must be generously dwelt on. Above all Rosy must be made to write\nletters, and with an air of freedom however specious.\n\nA knock on the door broke the thread of her reflection. It was a\nlow-sounding knock, and she answered the summons herself, because she\nthought it might be Rosy's.\n\nIt was not Lady Anstruthers who stood outside, but Ughtred, who balanced\nhimself on his crutches, and lifted his small, too mature, face.\n\n\"May I come in?\" he asked.\n\nHere was the unexpected again, but she did not allow him to see her\nsurprise.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"Certainly you may.\"\n\nHe swung in and then turned to speak to her.\n\n\"Please shut the door and lock it,\" he said.\n\nThere was sudden illumination in this, but of an order almost whimsical.\nThat modern people in modern days should feel bolts and bars a necessity\nof ordinary intercourse was suggestive. She was plainly about to receive\nenlightenment. She turned the key and followed the halting figure across\nthe room.\n\n\"What are you afraid of?\" she asked.\n\n\"When mother and I talk things over,\" he said, \"we always do it where no\none can see or hear. It's the only way to be safe.\"\n\n\"Safe from what?\"\n\nHis eyes fixed themselves on her as he answered her almost sullenly.\n\n\"Safe from people who might listen and go and tell that we had been\ntalking.\"\n\nIn his thwarted-looking, odd child-face there was a shade of appeal not\nwholly hidden by his evident wish not to be boylike. Betty felt a desire\nto kneel down suddenly and embrace him, but she knew he was not prepared\nfor such a demonstration. He looked like a creature who had lived\ncontinually at bay, and had learned to adjust himself to any situation\nwith caution and restraint.\n\n\"Sit down, Ughtred,\" she said, and when he did so she herself sat down,\nbut not too near him.\n\nResting his chin on the handle of a crutch, he gazed at her almost\nprotestingly.\n\n\"I always have to do these things,\" he said, \"and I am not clever\nenough, or old enough. I am only eleven.\"\n\nThe mention of the number of his years was plainly not apologetic, but\nwas a mere statement of his limitations. There the fact was, and he must\nmake the best of it he could.\n\n\"What things do you mean?\"\n\n\"Trying to make things easier--explaining things when she cannot think\nof excuses. To-day it is telling you what she is too frightened to tell\nyou herself. I said to her that you must be told. It made her nervous\nand miserable, but I knew you must.\"\n\n\"Yes, I must,\" Betty answered. \"I am glad she has you to depend on,\nUghtred.\"\n\nHis crutch grated on the floor and his boy eyes forbade her to believe\nthat their sudden lustre was in any way connected with restrained\nemotion.\n\n\"I know I seem queer and like a little old man,\" he said. \"Mother cries\nabout it sometimes. But it can't be helped. It is because she has never\nhad anyone but me to help her. When I was very little, I found out how\nfrightened and miserable she was. After his rages,\" he used no name,\n\"she used to run into my nursery and snatch me up in her arms and hide\nher face in my pinafore. Sometimes she stuffed it into her mouth and bit\nit to keep herself from screaming. Once--before I was seven--I ran into\ntheir room and shouted out, and tried to fight for her. He was going\nout, and had his riding whip in his hand, and he caught hold of me and\nstruck me with it--until he was tired.\"\n\nBetty stood upright.\n\n\"What! What! What!\" she cried out.\n\nHe merely nodded his head shortly. She saw what the thing had been by\nthe way his face lost colour.\n\n\"Of course he said it was because I was impudent, and needed\npunishment,\" he said. \"He said she had encouraged me in American\nimpudence. It was worse for her than for me. She kneeled down and\nscreamed out as if she was crazy, that she would give him what he wanted\nif he would stop.\"\n\n\"Wait,\" said Betty, drawing in her breath sharply. \"'He,' is Sir Nigel?\nAnd he wanted something.\"\n\nHe nodded again\n\n\"Tell me,\" she demanded, \"has he ever struck her?\"\n\n\"Once,\" he answered slowly, \"before I was born--he struck her and she\nfell against something. That is why I am like this.\" And he touched his\nshoulder.\n\nThe feeling which surged through Betty Vanderpoel's being forced her to\ngo and stand with her face turned towards the windows, her hands holding\neach other tightly behind her back.\n\n\"I must keep still,\" she said. \"I must make myself keep still.\"\n\nShe spoke unconsciously half aloud, and Ughtred heard her and replied\nhurriedly.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"you must make yourself keep still. That is what we have\nto do whatever happens. That is one of the things mother wanted you to\nknow. She is afraid. She daren't let you----\"\n\nShe turned from the window, standing at her full height and looking very\ntall for a girl.\n\n\"She is afraid? She daren't? See--that will come to an end now. There\nare things which can be done.\"\n\nHe flushed nervously.\n\n\"That is what she was afraid you would say,\" he spoke fast and his hands\ntrembled. \"She is nearly wild about it, because she knows he will try to\ndo something that will make you feel as if she does not want you.\"\n\n\"She is afraid of that?\" Betty exclaimed.\n\n\"He'd do it! He'd do it--if you did not know beforehand.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Betty, with unflinching clearness. \"He is a liar, is he?\"\n\nThe helpless rage in the unchildish eyes, the shaking voice, as he cried\nout in answer, were a shock. It was as if he wildly rejoiced that she\nhad spoken the word.\n\n\"Yes, he's a liar--a liar!\" he shrilled. \"He's a liar and a bully and a\ncoward. He'd--he'd be a murderer if he dared--but he daren't.\" And\nhis face dropped on his arms folded on his crutch, and he broke into\na passion of crying. Then Betty knew she might go to him. She went and\nknelt down and put her arm round him.\n\n\"Ughtred,\" she said, \"cry, if you like, I should do it, if I were you.\nBut I tell you it can all be altered--and it shall be.\"\n\nHe seemed quite like a little boy when he put out his hand to hers and\nspoke sobbingly:\n\n\"She--she says--that because you have only just come from America--and\nin America people--can do things--you will think you can do things\nhere--and you don't know. He will tell lies about you lies you can't\nbear. She sat wringing her hands when she thought of it. She won't\nlet you be hurt because you want to help her.\" He stopped abruptly and\nclutched her shoulder.\n\n\"Aunt Betty! Aunt Betty--whatever happens--whatever he makes her seem\nlike--you are to know that it is not true. Now you have come--now she\nhas seen you it would KILL her if you were driven away and thought she\nwanted you to go.\"\n\n\"I shall not think that,\" she answered, slowly, because she realised\nthat it was well that she had been warned in time. \"Ughtred, are you\ntrying to tell me that above all things I must not let him think that\nI came here to help you, because if he is angry he will make us all\nsuffer--and your mother most of all?\"\n\n\"He'll find a way. We always know he will. He would either be so rude\nthat you would not stay here--or he would make mother seem rude--or he\nwould write lies to grandfather. Aunt Betty, she scarcely believes you\nare real yet. If she won't tell you things at first, please don't mind.\"\nHe looked quite like a child again in his appeal to her, to try to\nunderstand a state of affairs so complicated. \"Could you--could you wait\nuntil you have let her get--get used to you?\"\n\n\"Used to thinking that there may be someone in the world to help her?\"\nslowly. \"Yes, I will. Has anyone ever tried to help her?\"\n\n\"Once or twice people found out and were sorry at first, but it only\nmade it worse, because he made them believe things.\"\n\n\"I shall not TRY, Ughtred,\" said Betty, a remote spark kindling in the\ndeeps of the pupils of her steel-blue eyes. \"I shall not TRY. Now I am\ngoing to ask you some questions.\"\n\nBefore he left her she had asked many questions which were pertinent\nand searching, and she had learned things she realised she could have\nlearned in no other way and from no other person. But for his uncanny\nsense of the responsibility he clearly had assumed in the days when he\nwore pinafores, and which had brought him to her room to prepare her\nmind for what she would find herself confronted with in the way of\napparently unexplainable obstacles, there was a strong likelihood that\nat the outset she might have found herself more than once dangerously\nat a loss. Yes, she would have been at a loss, puzzled, perhaps greatly\ndiscouraged. She was face to face with a complication so extraordinary.\n\nThat one man, through mere persistent steadiness in evil temper and\ndomestic tyranny, should have so broken the creatures of his household\ninto abject submission and hopelessness, seemed too incredible. Such a\npower appeared as remote from civilised existence in London and New York\nas did that which had inflicted tortures in the dungeons of castles of\nold. Prisoners in such dungeons could utter no cry which could reach the\noutside world; the prisoners at Stornham Court, not four hours from Hyde\nPark Corner, could utter none the world could hear, or comprehend if it\nheard it. Sheer lack of power to resist bound them hand and foot. And\nshe, Betty Vanderpoel, was here upon the spot, and, as far as she could\nunderstand, was being implored to take no steps, to do nothing. The\natmosphere in which she had spent her life, the world she had been\nborn into, had not made for fearfulness that one would be at any time\ndefenceless against circumstances and be obliged to submit to outrage.\nTo be a Vanderpoel was, it was true, to be a shining mark for envy as\nfor admiration, but the fact removed obstacles as a rule, and to find\none's self standing before a situation with one's hands, figuratively\nspeaking, tied, was new enough to arouse unusual sensations. She\nrecalled, with an ironic sense of bewilderment, as a sort of material\nevidence of her own reality, the fact that not a week ago she had\nstepped on to English soil from the gangway of a solid Atlantic liner.\nIt aided her to resist the feeling that she had been swept back into the\nMiddle Ages.\n\n\"When he is angry,\" was one of the first questions she put to Ughtred,\n\"what does he give as his reason? He must profess to have a reason.\"\n\n\"When he gets in a rage he says it is because mother is silly and\ncommon, and I am badly brought up. But we always know he wants money,\nand it makes him furious. He could kill us with rage.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Betty. \"I see.\"\n\n\"It began that time when he struck her. He said then that it was not\ndecent that a woman who was married should keep her own money. He made\nher give him almost everything she had, but she wants to keep some for\nme. He tries to make her get more from grandfather, but she will not\nwrite begging letters, and she won't give him what she is saving for\nme.\"\n\nIt was a simple and sordid enough explanation in one sense, and it was\none of which Bettina had known, not one parallel, but several. Having\nmarried to ensure himself power over unquestioned resources, the man had\nfelt himself disgustingly taken in, and avenged himself accordingly. In\nhim had been born the makings of a domestic tyrant who, even had he been\nfavoured by fortune, would have wreaked his humours upon the defenceless\nthings made his property by ties of blood and marriage, and who, being\nunfavoured, would do worse. Betty could see what the years had held for\nRosy, and how her weakness and timidity had been considered as positive\nassets. A woman who will cry when she is bullied, may be counted upon to\nsubmit after she has cried. Rosy had submitted up to a certain point and\nthen, with the stubbornness of a weak creature, had stood at timid bay\nfor her young.\n\nWhat Betty gathered was that, after the long and terrible illness which\nhad followed Ughtred's birth, she had risen from what had been so nearly\nher deathbed, prostrated in both mind and body. Ughtred did not know all\nthat he revealed when he touched upon the time which he said his mother\ncould not quite remember--when she had sat for months staring vacantly\nout of her window, trying to recall something terrible which had\nhappened, and which she wanted to tell her mother, if the day ever came\nwhen she could write to her again. She had never remembered clearly the\ndetails of the thing she had wanted to tell, and Nigel had insisted\nthat her fancy was part of her past delirium. He had said that at the\nbeginning of her delirium she had attacked and insulted his mother and\nhimself but they had excused her because they realised afterwards what\nthe cause of her excitement had been. For a long time she had been too\nbrokenly weak to question or disbelieve, but, later she had vaguely\nknown that he had been lying to her, though she could not refute what\nhe said. She recalled, in course of time, a horrible scene in which all\nthree of them had raved at each other, and she herself had shrieked and\nlaughed and hurled wild words at Nigel, and he had struck her. That she\nknew and never forgot. She had been ill a year, her hair had fallen out,\nher skin had faded and she had begun to feel like a nervous, tired old\nwoman instead of a girl. Girlhood, with all the past, had become unreal\nand too far away to be more than a dream. Nothing had remained real but\nStornham and Nigel and the little hunchbacked baby. She was glad when\nthe Dowager died and when Nigel spent his time in London or on the\nContinent and left her with Ughtred. When he said that he must spend her\nmoney on the estate, she had acquiesced without comment, because that\ninsured his going away. She saw that no improvement or repairs were\nmade, but she could do nothing and was too listless to make the attempt.\nShe only wanted to be left alone with Ughtred, and she exhibited\nwillpower only in defence of her child and in her obstinacy with regard\nto asking money of her father.\n\n\"She thought, somehow, that grandfather and grandmother did not care\nfor her any more--that they had forgotten her and only cared for you,\"\nUghtred explained. \"She used to talk to me about you. She said you must\nbe so clever and so handsome that no one could remember her. Sometimes\nshe cried and said she did not want any of you to see her again, because\nshe was only a hideous, little, thin, yellow old woman. When I was very\nlittle she told me stories about New York and Fifth Avenue. I thought\nthey were not real places--I though they were places in fairyland.\"\n\nBetty patted his shoulder and looked away for a moment when he said\nthis. In her remote and helpless loneliness, to Rosy's homesick,\nyearning soul, noisy, rattling New York, Fifth Avenue with its traffic\nand people, its brown-stone houses and ricketty stages, had seemed like\nTHAT--so splendid and bright and heart-filling, that she had painted\nthem in colours which could belong only to fairyland. It said so much.\n\nThe thing she had suspected as she had talked to her sister was, before\nthe interview ended, made curiously clear. The first obstacle in her\npathway would be the shrinking of a creature who had been so long under\ndominion that the mere thought of seeing any steps taken towards her\nrescue filled her with alarm. One might be prepared for her almost\npraying to be let alone, because she felt that the process of her\nsalvation would bring about such shocks and torments as she could not\nendure the facing of.\n\n\"She will have to get used to you,\" Ughtred kept saying. \"She will have\nto get used to thinking things.\"\n\n\"I will be careful,\" Bettina answered. \"She shall not be troubled. I did\nnot come to trouble her.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nONE OF THE NEW YORK DRESSES\n\nAs she went down the staircase later, on her way to dinner, Miss\nVanderpoel saw on all sides signs of the extent of the nakedness of\nthe land. She was in a fine old house, stripped of most of its saleable\nbelongings, uncared for, deteriorating year by year, gradually going to\nruin. One need not possess particular keenness of sight to observe\nthis, and she had chanced to see old houses in like condition in other\ncountries than England. A man-servant, in a shabby livery, opened the\ndrawing-room door for her. He was not a picturesque servitor of fallen\nfortunes, but an awkward person who was not accustomed to his duties.\nBetty wondered if he had been called in from the gardens to meet the\nnecessities of the moment. His furtive glance at the tall young woman\nwho passed him, took in with sudden embarrassment the fact that she\nplainly did not belong to the dispirited world bounded by Stornham\nCourt. Without sparkling gems or trailing richness in her wake, she was\nsuggestively splendid. He did not know whether it was her hair or the\nbuild of her neck and shoulders that did it, but it was revealed to him\nthat tiaras and collars of stones which blazed belonged without doubt\nto her equipment. He recalled that there was a legend to the effect that\nthe present Lady Anstruthers, who looked like a rag doll, had been the\ndaughter of a rich American, and that better things might have been\nexpected of her if she had not been such a poor-spirited creature. If\nthis was her sister, she perhaps was a young woman of fortune, and that\nshe was not of poor spirit was plain.\n\nThe large drawing-room presented but another aspect of the bareness\nof the rest of the house. In times probably long past, possibly in the\nDowager Lady Anstruthers' early years of marriage, the walls had been\nhung with white and gold paper of a pattern which dominated the scene,\nand had been furnished with gilded chairs, tables, and ottomans. Some\nof these last had evidently been removed as they became too much out of\nrepair for use or ornament. Such as remained, tarnished as to gilding\nand worn in the matter of upholstery, stood sparsely scattered on a\ndesert of carpet, whose huge, flowered medallions had faded almost from\nview.\n\nLady Anstruthers, looking shy and awkward as she fingered an ornament on\na small table, seemed singularly a part of her background. Her evening\ndress, slipping off her thin shoulders, was as faded and out of date\nas her carpet. It had once been delicately blue and gauzy, but its\ngauziness hung in crushed folds and its blue was almost grey. It was\nalso the dress of a girl, not that of a colourless, worn woman, and her\nconsciousness of its unfitness showed in her small-featured face as she\ncame forward.\n\n\"Do you--recognise it, Betty?\" she asked hesitatingly. \"It was one of my\nNew York dresses. I put it on because--because----\" and her stammering\nended helplessly.\n\n\"Because you wanted to remind me,\" Betty said. If she felt it easier to\nbegin with an excuse she should be provided with one.\n\nPerhaps but for this readiness to fall into any tone she chose to adopt\nRosy might have endeavoured to carry her poor farce on, but as it was\nshe suddenly gave it up.\n\n\"I put it on because I have no other,\" she said. \"We never have visitors\nand I haven't dressed for dinner for so long that I seem to have nothing\nleft that is fit to wear. I dragged this out because it was better than\nanything else. It was pretty once----\" she gave a little laugh, \"twelve\nyears ago. How long years seem! Was I--was I pretty, Betty--twelve years\nago?\"\n\n\"Twelve years is not such a long time.\" Betty took her hand and drew her\nto a sofa. \"Let us sit down and talk about it.\"\n\n\"There is nothing much to talk about. This is it----\" taking in the room\nwith a wave of her hand. \"I am it. Ughtred is it.\"\n\n\"Then let us talk about England,\" was Bettina's light skim over the thin\nice.\n\nA red spot grew on each of Lady Anstruthers' cheek bones and made her\nfaded eyes look intense.\n\n\"Let us talk about America,\" her little birdclaw of a hand clinging\nfeverishly. \"Is New York still--still----\"\n\n\"It is still there,\" Betty answered with one of the adorable smiles\nwhich showed a deep dimple near her lip. \"But it is much nearer England\nthan it used to be.\"\n\n\"Nearer!\" The hand tightened as Rosy caught her breath.\n\nBetty bent rather suddenly and kissed her. It was the easiest way of\nhiding the look she knew had risen to her eyes. She began to talk gaily,\nhalf laughingly.\n\n\"It is quite near,\" she said. \"Don't you realise it? Americans swoop\nover here by thousands every year. They come for business, they come for\npleasure, they come for rest. They cannot keep away. They come to buy\nand sell--pictures and books and luxuries and lands. They come to give\nand take. They are building a bridge from shore to shore of their work,\nand their thoughts, and their plannings, out of the lives and souls of\nthem. It will be a great bridge and great things will pass over it.\"\nShe kissed the faded cheek again. She wanted to sweep Rosy away from the\ndreariness of \"it.\" Lady Anstruthers looked at her with faintly smiling\neyes. She did not follow all this quite readily, but she felt pleased\nand vaguely comforted.\n\n\"I know how they come here and marry,\" she said. \"The new Duchess of\nDownes is an American. She had a fortune of two million pounds.\"\n\n\"If she chooses to rebuild a great house and a great name,\" said Betty,\nlifting her shoulders lightly, \"why not--if it is an honest bargain? I\nsuppose it is part of the building of the bridge.\"\n\nLittle Lady Anstruthers, trying to pull up the sleeves of the gauzy\nbodice slipping off her small, sharp bones, stared at her half in\nwondering adoration, half in alarm.\n\n\"Betty--you--you are so handsome--and so clever and strange,\" she\nfluttered. \"Oh, Betty, stand up so that I can see how tall and handsome\nyou are!\"\n\nBetty did as she was told, and upon her feet she was a young woman of\nlong lines, and fine curves so inspiring to behold that Lady Anstruthers\nclasped her hands together on her knees in an excited gesture.\n\n\"Oh, yes! Oh, yes!\" she cried. \"You are just as wonderful as you looked\nwhen I turned and saw you under the trees. You almost make me afraid.\"\n\n\"Because I am wonderful?\" said Betty. \"Then I will not be wonderful any\nmore.\"\n\n\"It is not because I think you wonderful, but because other people will.\nWould you rebuild a great house?\" hesitatingly.\n\nThe fine line of Betty's black brows drew itself slightly together.\n\n\"No,\" she said.\n\n\n\"Wouldn't you?\"\n\n\"How could the man who owned it persuade me that he was in earnest if he\nsaid he loved me? How could I persuade him that I was worth caring for\nand not a mere ambitious fool? There would be too much against us.\"\n\n\"Against you?\" repeated Lady Anstruthers.\n\n\"I don't say I am fair,\" said Betty. \"People who are proud are often not\nfair. But we should both of us have seen and known too much.\"\n\n\"You have seen me now,\" said Lady Anstruthers in her listless voice, and\nat the same moment dinner was announced and she got up from the sofa, so\nthat, luckily, there was no time for the impersonal answer it would have\nbeen difficult to invent at a moment's notice. As they went into the\ndining-room Betty was thinking restlessly. She remembered all the\nmaterial she had collected during her education in France and Germany,\nand there was added to it the fact that she HAD seen Rosy, and having\nher before her eyes she felt that there was small prospect of\nher contemplating the rebuilding of any great house requiring\nreconstruction.\n\nThere was fine panelling in the dining-room and a great fireplace and\na few family portraits. The service upon the table was shabby and the\ndinner was not a bounteous meal. Lady Anstruthers in her girlish, gauzy\ndress and looking too small for her big, high-backed chair tried to talk\nrapidly, and every few minutes forgot herself and sank into silence,\nwith her eyes unconsciously fixed upon her sister's face. Ughtred\nwatched Betty also, and with a hungry questioning. The man-servant in\nthe worn livery was not a sufficiently well-trained and experienced\ndomestic to make any effort to keep his eyes from her. He was young\nenough to be excited by an innovation so unusual as the presence of a\nyoung and beautiful person surrounded by an unmistakable atmosphere of\nease and fearlessness. He had been talking of her below stairs and\nfelt that he had failed in describing her. He had found himself barely\nsupported by the suggestion of a housemaid that sometimes these dresses\nthat looked plain had been made in Paris at expensive places and had\ncost \"a lot.\" He furtively examined the dress which looked plain, and\nwhile he admitted that for some mysterious reason it might represent\nexpensiveness, it was not the dress which was the secret of the effect,\nbut a something, not altogether mere good looks, expressed by the\nwearer. It was, in fact, the thing which the second-class passenger,\nSalter, had been at once attracted and stirred to rebellion by when Miss\nVanderpoel came on board the Meridiana.\n\nBetty did not look too small for her high-backed chair, and she did\nnot forget herself when she talked. In spite of all she had found,\nher imagination was stirred by the surroundings. Her sense of the fine\nspaces and possibilities of dignity in the barren house, her knowledge\nthat outside the windows there lay stretched broad views of the park and\nits heavy-branched trees, and that outside the gates stood the\nneglected picturesqueness of the village and all the rural and--to\nher--interesting life it slowly lived--this pleased and attracted her.\n\nIf she had been as helpless and discouraged as Rosalie she could see\nthat it would all have meant a totally different and depressing thing,\nbut, strong and spirited, and with the power of full hands, she was\nremotely rejoicing in what might be done with it all. As she talked\nshe was gradually learning detail. Sir Nigel was on the Continent.\nApparently he often went there; also it revealed itself that no one knew\nat what moment he might return, for what reason he would return, or if\nhe would return at all during the summer. It was evident that no one had\nbeen at any time encouraged to ask questions as to his intentions, or to\nfeel that they had a right to do so.\n\nThis she knew, and a number of other things, before they left the table.\nWhen they did so they went out to stroll upon the moss-grown stone\nterrace and listened to the nightingales throwing into the air silver\nfountains of trilling song. When Bettina paused, leaning against the\nbalustrade of the terrace that she might hear all the beauty of it, and\nfeel all the beauty of the warm spring night, Rosy went on making her\neffort to talk.\n\n\"It is not much of a neighbourhood, Betty,\" she said. \"You are too\naccustomed to livelier places to like it.\"\n\n\"That is my reason for feeling that I shall like it. I don't think I\ncould be called a lively person, and I rather hate lively places.\"\n\n\"But you are accustomed--accustomed----\" Rosy harked back uncertainly.\n\n\"I have been accustomed to wishing that I could come to you,\" said\nBetty. \"And now I am here.\"\n\nLady Anstruthers laid a hand on her dress.\n\n\"I can't believe it! I can't believe it!\" she breathed.\n\n\"You will believe it,\" said Betty, drawing the hand around her waist\nand enclosing in her own arm the narrow shoulders. \"Tell me about the\nneighbourhood.\"\n\n\"There isn't any, really,\" said Lady Anstruthers. \"The houses are so far\naway from each other. The nearest is six miles from here, and it is one\nthat doesn't count.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"There is no family, and the man who owns it is so poor. It is a big\nplace, but it is falling to pieces as this is.\n\n\"What is it called?\"\n\n\"Mount Dunstan. The present earl only succeeded about three years ago.\nNigel doesn't know him. He is queer and not liked. He has been away.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"No one knows. To Australia or somewhere. He has odd ideas. The Mount\nDunstans have been awful people for two generations. This man's father\nwas almost mad with wickedness. So was the elder son. This is a second\nson, and he came into nothing but debt. Perhaps he feels the disgrace\nand it makes him rude and ill-tempered. His father and elder brother had\nbeen in such scandals that people did not invite them.\n\n\"Do they invite this man?\"\n\n\"No. He probably would not go to their houses if they did. And he went\naway soon after he came into the title.\"\n\n\"Is the place beautiful?\"\n\n\"There is a fine deer park, and the gardens were wonderful a long time\nago. The house is worth looking at--outside.\"\n\n\"I will go and look at it,\" said Betty.\n\n\"The carriage is out of order. There is only Ughtred's cart.\"\n\n\"I am a good walker,\" said Betty.\n\n\"Are you? It would be twelve miles--there and back. When I was in New\nYork people didn't walk much, particularly girls.\"\n\n\"They do now,\" Betty answered. \"They have learned to do it in England.\nThey live out of doors and play games. They have grown athletic and\ntall.\"\n\nAs they talked the nightingales sang, sometimes near, sometimes in the\ndistance, and scents of dewy grass and leaves and earth were wafted\ntowards them. Sometimes they strolled up and down the terrace, sometimes\nthey paused and leaned against the stone balustrade. Betty allowed Rosy\nto talk as she chose. She herself asked no obviously leading questions\nand passed over trying moments with lightness. Her desire was to place\nherself in a position where she might hear the things which would aid\nher to draw conclusions. Lady Anstruthers gradually grew less nervous\nand afraid of her subjects. In the wonder of the luxury of talking to\nsomeone who listened with sympathy, she once or twice almost forgot\nherself and made revelations she had not intended to make. She had often\nthe manner of a person who was afraid of being overheard; sometimes,\neven when she was making speeches quite simple in themselves, her voice\ndropped and she glanced furtively aside as if there were chances that\nsomething she dreaded might step out of the shadow.\n\nWhen they went upstairs together and parted for the night, the clinging\nof Rosy's embrace was for a moment almost convulsive. But she tried to\nlaugh off its suggestion of intensity.\n\n\"I held you tight so that I could feel sure that you were real and would\nnot melt away,\" she said. \"I hope you will be here in the morning.\"\n\n\"I shall never really go quite away again, now I have come,\" Betty\nanswered. \"It is not only your house I have come into. I have come back\ninto your life.\"\n\nAfter she had entered her room and locked the door she sat down and\nwrote a letter to her father. It was a long letter, but a clear one.\nShe painted a definite and detailed picture and made distinct her chief\npoint.\n\n\"She is afraid of me,\" she wrote. \"That is the first and worst obstacle.\nShe is actually afraid that I will do something which will only add to\nher trouble. She has lived under dominion so long that she has forgotten\nthat there are people who have no reason for fear. Her old life seems\nnothing but a dream. The first thing I must teach her is that I am to be\ntrusted not to do futile things, and that she need neither be afraid of\nnor for me.\"\n\nAfter writing these sentences she found herself leaving her desk and\nwalking up and down the room to relieve herself. She could not sit\nstill, because suddenly the blood ran fast and hot through her veins.\nShe put her hands against her cheeks and laughed a little, low laugh.\n\n\"I feel violent,\" she said. \"I feel violent and I must get over it. This\nis rage. Rage is worth nothing.\"\n\nIt was rage--the rage of splendid hot blood which surged in answer to\nleaping hot thoughts. There would have been a sort of luxury in giving\nway to the sway of it. But the self-indulgence would have been no aid to\nfuture action. Rage was worth nothing. She said it as the first Reuben\nVanderpoel might have said of a useless but glittering weapon. \"This gun\nis worth nothing,\" and cast it aside.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nIN THE GARDENS\n\nShe came out upon the stone terrace again rather early in the morning.\nShe wanted to wander about in the first freshness of the day, which was\nalways an uplifting thing to her. She wanted to see the dew on the grass\nand on the ragged flower borders and to hear the tender, broken fluting\nof birds in the trees. One cuckoo was calling to another in the park,\nand she stopped and listened intently. Until yesterday she had never\nheard a cuckoo call, and its hollow mellowness gave her delight. It\nmeant the spring in England, and nowhere else.\n\nThere was space enough to ramble about in the gardens. Paths and beds\nwere alike overgrown with weeds, but some strong, early-blooming things\nwere fighting for life, refusing to be strangled. Against the beautiful\nold red walls, over which age had stolen with a wonderful grey bloom,\nvenerable fruit trees were spread and nailed, and here and there showed\nbloom, clumps of low-growing things sturdily advanced their yellowness\nor whiteness, as if defying neglect. In one place a wall slanted and\nthreatened to fall, bearing its nectarine trees with it; in another\nthere was a gap so evidently not of to-day that the heap of its masonry\nupon the border bed was already covered with greenery, and the roots of\nthe fruit tree it had supported had sent up strong, insistent shoots.\n\nShe passed down broad paths and narrow ones, sometimes walking under\ntrees, sometimes pushing her way between encroaching shrubs; she\ndescended delightful mossy and broken steps and came upon dilapidated\nurns, in which weeds grew instead of flowers, and over which rampant but\nlovely, savage little creepers clambered and clung.\n\nIn one of the walled kitchen gardens she came upon an elderly gardener\nat work. At the sound of her approaching steps he glanced round and then\nstood up, touching his forelock in respectful but startled salute. He\nwas so plainly amazed at the sight of her that she explained herself.\n\n\"Good-morning,\" she said. \"I am her ladyship's sister, Miss Vanderpoel.\nI came yesterday evening. I am looking over your gardens.\"\n\nHe touched his forehead again and looked round him. His manner was not\ncheerful. He cast a troubled eye about him.\n\n\"They're not much to see, miss,\" he said. \"They'd ought to be, but\nthey're not. Growing things has to be fed and took care of. A man and a\nboy can't do it--nor yet four or five of 'em.\"\n\n\"How many ought there to be?\" Betty inquired, with business-like\ndirectness. It was not only the dew on the grass she had come out to\nsee.\n\n\"If there was eight or ten of us we might put it in order and keep it\nthat way. It's a big place, miss.\"\n\nBetty looked about her as he had done, but with a less discouraged eye.\n\n\"It is a beautiful place, as well as a large one,\" she said. \"I can see\nthat there ought to be more workers.\"\n\n\"There's no one,\" said the gardener, \"as has as many enemies as a\ngardener, an' as many things to fight. There's grubs an' there's\ngreenfly, an' there's drout', an' wet an' cold, an' mildew, an' there's\nwhat the soil wants and starves without, an' if you haven't got it nor\nyet hands an' feet an' tools enough, how's things to feed, an' fight an'\nlive--let alone bloom an' bear?\"\n\n\"I don't know much about gardens,\" said Miss Vanderpoel, \"but I can\nunderstand that.\"\n\nThe scent of fresh bedewed things was in the air. It was true that she\nhad not known much about gardens, but here standing in the midst of\none she began to awaken to a new, practical interest. A creature of\ninitiative could not let such a place as this alone. It was beauty being\nslowly slain. One could not pass it by and do nothing.\n\n\"What is your name?\" she asked\n\n\"Kedgers, miss. I've only been here about a twelve-month. I was took on\nbecause I'm getting on in years an' can't ask much wage.\"\n\n\"Can you spare time to take me through the gardens and show me things?\"\n\nYes, he could do it. In truth, he privately welcomed an opportunity\noffering a prospect of excitement so novel. He had shown more\nflourishing gardens to other young ladies in his past years of service,\nbut young ladies did not come to Stornham, and that one having, with\nsuch extraordinary unexpectedness arrived, should want to look over the\ndesolation of these, was curious enough to rouse anyone to a sense of\na break in accustomed monotony. The young lady herself mystified him\nby her difference from such others as he had seen. What the man in the\nshabby livery had felt, he felt also, and added to this was a sense of\nthe practicalness of the questions she asked and the interest she showed\nand a way she had of seeming singularly to suggest by the look in her\neyes and the tone of her voice that nothing was necessarily without\nremedy. When her ladyship walked through the place and looked at things,\na pale resignation expressed itself in the very droop of her\nfigure. When this one walked through the tumbled-down grape-houses,\npotting-sheds and conservatories, she saw where glass was broken, where\nbenches had fallen and where roofs sagged and leaked. She inquired about\nthe heating apparatus and asked that she might see it. She asked about\nthe village and its resources, about labourers and their wages.\n\n\"As if,\" commented Kedgers mentally, \"she was what Sir Nigel\nis--leastways what he'd ought to be an' ain't.\"\n\nShe led the way back to the fallen wall and stood and looked at it.\n\n\"It's a beautiful old wall,\" she said. \"It should be rebuilt with the\nold brick. New would spoil it.\"\n\n\"Some of this is broken and crumbled away,\" said Kedgers, picking up a\npiece to show it to her.\n\n\"Perhaps old brick could be bought somewhere,\" replied the young lady\nspeculatively. \"One ought to be able to buy old brick in England, if one\nis willing to pay for it.\"\n\nKedgers scratched his head and gazed at her in respectful wonder which\nwas almost trouble. Who was going to pay for things, and who was going\nto look for things which were not on the spot? Enterprise like this was\nnot to be explained.\n\nWhen she left him he stood and watched her upright figure disappear\nthrough the ivy-grown door of the kitchen gardens with a disturbed\nbut elated expression on his countenance. He did not know why he felt\nelated, but he was conscious of elation. Something new had walked\ninto the place. He stopped his work and grinned and scratched his head\nseveral times after he went back to his pottering among the cabbage\nplants.\n\n\"My word,\" he muttered. \"She's a fine, straight young woman. If she\nwas her ladyship things 'ud be different. Sir Nigel 'ud be different,\ntoo--or there'd be some fine upsets.\"\n\nThere was a huge stable yard, and Betty passed through that on her way\nback. The door of the carriage house was open and she saw two or three\ntumbled-down vehicles. One was a landau with a wheel off, one was a\nshabby, old-fashioned, low phaeton. She caught sight of a patently\nvenerable cob in one of the stables. The stalls near him were empty.\n\n\"I suppose that is all they have to depend upon,\" she thought. \"And the\nstables are like the gardens.\"\n\nShe found Lady Anstruthers and Ughtred waiting for her upon the terrace,\neach of them regarding her with an expression suggestive of repressed\ncuriosity as she approached. Lady Anstruthers flushed a little and went\nto meet her with an eager kiss.\n\n\"You look like--I don't know quite what you look like, Betty!\" she\nexclaimed.\n\nThe girl's dimple deepened and her eyes said smiling things.\n\n\"It is the morning--and your gardens,\" she answered. \"I have been round\nyour gardens.\"\n\n\"They were beautiful once, I suppose,\" said Rosy deprecatingly.\n\n\"They are beautiful now. There is nothing like them in America at\nleast.\"\n\n\"I don't remember any gardens in America,\" Lady Anstruthers owned\nreluctantly, \"but everything seemed so cheerful and well cared for\nand--and new. Don't laugh, Betty. I have begun to like new things. You\nwould if you had watched old ones tumbling to pieces for twelve years.\"\n\n\"They ought not to be allowed to tumble to pieces,\" said Betty. She\nadded her next words with simple directness. She could only discover\nhow any advancing steps would be taken by taking them. \"Why do you allow\nthem to do it?\"\n\nLady Anstruthers looked away, but as she looked her eyes passed\nUghtred's.\n\n\"I!\" she said. \"There are so many other things to do. It would cost so\nmuch--such an enormity to keep it all in order.\"\n\n\"But it ought to be done--for Ughtred's sake.\"\n\n\"I know that,\" faltered Rosy, \"but I can't help it.\"\n\n\"You can,\" answered Betty, and she put her arm round her as they turned\nto enter the house. \"When you have become more used to me and my driving\nAmerican ways I will show you how.\"\n\nThe lightness with which she said it had an odd effect on Lady\nAnstruthers. Such casual readiness was so full of the suggestion of\nunheard of possibilities that it was a kind of shock.\n\n\"I have been twelve years in getting un-used to you--I feel as if it\nwould take twelve years more to get used again,\" she said.\n\n\"It won't take twelve weeks,\" said Betty.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nTHE FIRST MAN\n\nThe mystery of the apparently occult methods of communication among\nthe natives of India, between whom, it is said, news flies by means too\nstrange and subtle to be humanly explainable, is no more difficult\na problem to solve than that of the lightning rapidity with which a\nknowledge of the transpiring of any new local event darts through\nthe slowest, and, as far as outward signs go, the least communicative\nEnglish village slumbering drowsily among its pastures and trees.\n\nThat which the Hall or Manor House believed last night, known only\nto the four walls of its drawing-room, is discussed over the cottage\nbreakfast tables as though presented in detail through the columns of\nthe Morning Post. The vicarage, the smithy, the post office, the\nlittle provision shop, are instantaneously informed as by magic of such\nincidents of interest as occur, and are prepared to assist vicariously\nat any future developments. Through what agency information is given\nno one can tell, and, indeed, the agency is of small moment. Facts of\ninterest are perhaps like flights of swallows and dart chattering from\none red roof to another, proclaiming themselves aloud. Nothing is\nso true as that in such villages they are the property and innocent\nplaythings of man, woman, and child, providing conversation and drama\notherwise likely to be lacked.\n\nWhen Miss Vanderpoel walked through Stornham village street she became\naware that she was an exciting object of interest. Faces appeared at\ncottage windows, women sauntered to doors, men in the taproom of the\nClock Inn left beer mugs to cast an eye on her; children pushed open\ngates and stared as they bobbed their curtsies; the young woman who kept\nthe shop left her counter and came out upon her door step to pick up\nher straying baby and glance over its shoulder at the face with the red\nmouth, and the mass of black hair rolled upward under a rough blue\nstraw hat. Everyone knew who this exotic-looking young lady was. She had\narrived yesterday from London, and a week ago by means of a ship from\nfar-away America, from the country in connection with which the rural\nmind curiously mixed up large wages, great fortunes and Indians.\n\"Gaarge\" Lunsden, having spent five years of his youth labouring heavily\nfor sixteen shillings a week, had gone to \"Meriker\" and had earned there\neight shillings a day. This was a well-known and much-talked over\nfact, and had elevated the western continent to a position of trust and\nimportance it had seriously lacked before the emigration of Lunsden. A\nplace where a man could earn eight shillings a day inspired interest as\nwell as confidence. When Sir Nigel's wife had arrived twelve years ago\nas the new Lady Anstruthers, the story that she herself \"had money\" had\nbeen verified by her fine clothes and her way of handing out sovereigns\nin cases where the rest of the gentry, if they gave at all, would have\nbestowed tea and flannel or shillings. There had been for a few months a\nperiod of unheard of well-being in Stornham village; everyone remembered\nthe hundred pounds the bride had given to poor Wilson when his place had\nburned down, but the village had of course learned, by its occult means,\nthat Sir Nigel and the Dowager had been angry and that there had been a\nquarrel. Afterwards her ladyship had been dangerously ill, the baby had\nbeen born a hunchback, and a year had passed before its mother had been\nseen again. Since then she had been a changed creature; she had lost her\nlooks and seemed to care for nothing but the child. Stornham village\nsaw next to nothing of her, and it certainly was not she who had the\ndispensing of her fortune. Rumour said Sir Nigel lived high in London\nand foreign parts, but there was no high living at the Court. Her\nladyship's family had never been near her, and belief in them and their\nwealth almost ceased to exist. If they were rich, Stornham felt that it\nwas their business to mend roofs and windows and not allow chimneys and\nkitchen boilers to fall into ruin, the simple, leading article of faith\nbeing that even American money belonged properly to England.\n\nAs Miss Vanderpoel walked at a light, swinging pace through the one\nvillage street the gazers felt with Kedgers that something new was\npassing and stirring the atmosphere. She looked straight, and with a\nfriendliness somehow dominating, at the curious women; her handsome eyes\nmet those of the men in a human questioning; she smiled and nodded to\nthe bobbing children. One of these, young enough to be uncertain on\nits feet, in running to join some others stumbled and fell on the path\nbefore her. Opening its mouth in the inevitable resultant roar, it was\nshocked almost into silence by the tall young lady stooping at once,\npicking it up, and cheerfully dusting its pinafore.\n\n\"Don't cry,\" she said; \"you are not hurt, you know.\"\n\nThe deep dimple near her mouth showed itself, and the laugh in her eyes\nwas so reassuring that the penny she put into the grubby hand was less\nproductive of effect than her mere self. She walked on, leaving the\ngroup staring after her breathless, because of a sense of having met\nwith a wonderful adventure. The grand young lady with the black hair\nand the blue hat and tall, straight body was the adventure. She left the\nsame sense of event with the village itself. They talked of her all day\nover their garden palings, on their doorsteps, in the street; of her\nlooks, of her height, of the black rim of lashes round her eyes, of\nthe chance that she might be rich and ready to give half-crowns and\nsovereigns, of the \"Meriker\" she had come from, and above all of the\nreason for her coming.\n\nBetty swung with the light, firm step of a good walker out on to the\nhighway. To walk upon the fine, smooth old Roman road was a pleasure\nin itself, but she soon struck away from it and went through lanes and\nby-ways, following sign-posts because she knew where she was going. Her\nwalk was to take her to Mount Dunstan and home again by another road. In\nwalking, an objective point forms an interest, and what she had heard of\nthe estate from Rosalie was a vague reason for her caring to see it. It\nwas another place like Stornham, once dignified and nobly representative\nof fine things, now losing their meanings and values. Values and\nmeanings, other than mere signs of wealth and power, there had been.\nCenturies ago strong creatures had planned and built it for such reasons\nas strength has for its planning and building. In Bettina Vanderpoel's\nimagination the First Man held powerful and moving sway. It was he whom\nshe always saw. In history, as a child at school, she had understood and\ndrawn close to him. There was always a First Man behind all that one\nsaw or was told, one who was the fighter, the human thing who snatched\nweapons and tools from stones and trees and wielded them in the carrying\nout of the thought which was his possession and his strength. He was the\nGod made human; others waited, without knowledge of their waiting,\nfor the signal he gave. A man like others--with man's body, hands, and\nlimbs, and eyes--the moving of a whole world was subtly altered by his\nbirth. One could not always trace him, but with stone axe and spear\npoint he had won savage lands in savage ways, and so ruled them that,\nleaving them to other hands, their march towards less savage life could\nnot stay itself, but must sweep on; others of his kind, striking rude\nharps, had so sung that the loud clearness of their wild songs had rung\nthrough the ages, and echo still in strains which are theirs, though\nvoices of to-day repeat the note of them. The First Man, a Briton\nstained with woad and hung with skins, had tilled the luscious greenness\nof the lands richly rolling now within hedge boundaries. The square\nchurch towers rose, holding their slender corner spires above the trees,\nas a result of the First Man, Norman William. The thought which held its\nplace, the work which did not pass away, had paid its First Man wages;\nbut beauties crumbling, homes falling to waste, were bitter things. The\nFirst Man, who, having won his splendid acres, had built his home upon\nthem and reared his young and passed his possession on with a proud\nheart, seemed but ill treated. Through centuries the home had enriched\nitself, its acres had borne harvests, its trees had grown and spread\nhuge branches, full lives had been lived within the embrace of the\nmassive walls, there had been loves and lives and marriages and births,\nthe breathings of them made warm and full the very air. To Betty it\nseemed that the land itself would have worn another face if it had not\nbeen trodden by so many springing feet, if so many harvests had not\nwaved above it, if so many eyes had not looked upon and loved it.\n\nShe passed through variations of the rural loveliness she had seen on\nher way from the station to the Court, and felt them grow in beauty as\nshe saw them again. She came at last to a village somewhat larger than\nStornham and marked by the signs of the lack of money-spending care\nwhich Stornham showed. Just beyond its limits a big park gate opened on\nto an avenue of massive trees. She stopped and looked down it, but\ncould see nothing but its curves and, under the branches, glimpses of a\nspacious sweep of park with other trees standing in groups or alone\nin the sward. The avenue was unswept and untended, and here and there\nboughs broken off by wind.\n\nStorms lay upon it. She turned to the road again and followed it,\nbecause it enclosed the park and she wanted to see more of its evident\nbeauty. It was very beautiful. As she walked on she saw it rolled into\nwoods and deeps filled with bracken; she saw stretches of hillocky,\nfine-grassed rabbit warren, and hollows holding shadowy pools; she\ncaught the gleam of a lake with swans sailing slowly upon it with curved\nnecks; there were wonderful lights and wonderful shadows, and brooding\nstillness, which made her footfall upon the road a too material thing.\n\nSuddenly she heard a stirring in the bracken a yard or two away from\nher. Something was moving slowly among the waving masses of huge fronds\nand caused them to sway to and fro. It was an antlered stag who rose\nfrom his bed in the midst of them, and with majestic deliberation\ngot upon his feet and stood gazing at her with a calmness of pose\nso splendid, and a liquid darkness and lustre of eye so stilly and\nfearlessly beautiful, that she caught her breath. He simply gazed as her\nas a great king might gaze at an intruder, scarcely deigning wonder.\n\nAs she had passed on her way, Betty had seen that the enclosing park\npalings were decaying, covered with lichen and falling at intervals. It\nhad even passed through her mind that here was one of the demands\nfor expenditure on a large estate, which limited resources could not\nconfront with composure. The deer fence itself, a thing of wire ten\nfeet high, to form an obstacle to leaps, she had marked to be in such\ncondition as to threaten to become shortly a useless thing. Until this\nmoment she had seen no deer, but looking beyond the stag and across\nthe sward she now saw groups near each other, stags cropping or looking\ntowards her with lifted heads, does at a respectful but affectionate\ndistance from them, some caring for their fawns. The stag who had risen\nnear her had merely walked through a gap in the boundary and now stood\nfree to go where he would.\n\n\"He will get away,\" said Betty, knitting her black brows. Ah! what a\nshame!\n\nEven with the best intentions one could not give chase to a stag. She\nlooked up and down the road, but no one was within sight. Her brows\ncontinued to knit themselves and her eyes ranged over the park itself in\nthe hope that some labourer on the estate, some woodman or game-keeper,\nmight be about.\n\n\n\"It is no affair of mine,\" she said, \"but it would be too bad to let him\nget away, though what happens to stray stags one doesn't exactly know.\"\n\nAs she said it she caught sight of someone, a man in leggings and shabby\nclothes and with a gun over his shoulder, evidently an under keeper. He\nwas a big, rather rough-looking fellow, but as he lurched out into\nthe open from a wood Betty saw that she could reach him if she passed\nthrough a narrow gate a few yards away and walked quickly.\n\nHe was slouching along, his head drooping and his broad shoulders\nexpressing the definite antipodes of good spirits. Betty studied his\nback as she strode after him, her conclusion being that he was perhaps\nnot a good-humoured man to approach at any time, and that this was by\nill luck one of his less fortunate hours.\n\n\"Wait a moment, if you please,\" her clear, mellow voice flung out after\nhim when she was within hearing distance. \"I want to speak to you,\nkeeper.\"\n\nHe turned with an air of far from pleased surprise. The afternoon\nsun was in his eyes and made him scowl. For a moment he did not see\ndistinctly who was approaching him, but he had at once recognised a\ncertain cool tone of command in the voice whose suddenness had roused\nhim from a black mood. A few steps brought them to close quarters, and\nwhen he found himself looking into the eyes of his pursuer he made\na movement as if to lift his cap, then checking himself, touched it,\nkeeper fashion.\n\n\"Oh!\" he said shortly. \"Miss Vanderpoel! Beg pardon.\"\n\nBettina stood still a second. She had her surprise also. Here was the\nunexpected again. The under keeper was the red-haired second-class\npassenger of the Meridiana.\n\nHe did not look pleased to see her, and the suddenness of his appearance\nexcluded the possibility of her realising that upon the whole she was at\nleast not displeased to see him.\n\n\"How do you do?\" she said, feeling the remark fantastically\nconventional, but not being inspired by any alternative. \"I came to tell\nyou that one of the stags has got through a gap in the fence.\"\n\n\"Damn!\" she heard him say under his breath. Aloud he said, \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"He is a splendid creature,\" she said. \"I did not know what to do. I was\nglad to see a keeper coming.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" he said again, and strode towards the place where the\nstag still stood gazing up the road, as if reflecting as to whether it\nallured him or not.\n\nBetty walked back more slowly, watching him with interest. She wondered\nwhat he would find it necessary to do. She heard him begin a low,\nflute-like whistling, and then saw the antlered head turn towards him.\nThe woodland creature moved, but it was in his direction. It had without\ndoubt answered his call before and knew its meaning to be friendly. It\nwent towards him, stretching out a tender sniffing nose, and he put\nhis hand in the pocket of his rough coat and gave it something to eat.\nAfterwards he went to the gap in the fence and drew the wires together,\nfastening them with other wire, which he also took out of the coat\npocket.\n\n\"He is not afraid of making himself useful,\" thought Betty. \"And the\nanimals know him. He is not as bad as he looks.\"\n\nShe lingered a moment watching him, and then walked towards the gate\nthrough which she had entered. He glanced up as she neared him.\n\n\"I don't see your carriage,\" he said. \"Your man is probably round the\ntrees.\"\n\n\"I walked,\" answered Betty. \"I had heard of this place and wanted to see\nit.\"\n\nHe stood up, putting his wire back into his pocket.\n\n\"There is not much to be seen from the road,\" he said. \"Would you like\nto see more of it?\"\n\nHis manner was civil enough, but not the correct one for a servant.\nHe did not say \"miss\" or touch his cap in making the suggestion. Betty\nhesitated a moment.\n\n\"Is the family at home?\" she inquired.\n\n\"There is no family but--his lordship. He is off the place.\"\n\n\"Does he object to trespassers?\"\n\n\"Not if they are respectable and take no liberties.\"\n\n\"I am respectable, and I shall not take liberties,\" said Miss\nVanderpoel, with a touch of hauteur. The truth was that she had spent a\nsufficient number of years on the Continent to have become familiar with\nconventions which led her not to approve wholly of his bearing. Perhaps\nhe had lived long enough in America to forget such conventions and to\nlack something which centuries of custom had decided should belong\nto his class. A certain suggestion of rough force in the man rather\nattracted her, and her slight distaste for his manner arose from the\nrealisation that a gentleman's servant who did not address his superiors\nas was required by custom was not doing his work in a finished way. In\nhis place she knew her own demeanour would have been finished.\n\n\"If you are sure that Lord Mount Dunstan would not object to my walking\nabout, I should like very much to see the gardens and the house,\" she\nsaid. \"If you show them to me, shall I be interfering with your duties?\"\n\n\"No,\" he answered, and then for the first time rather glumly added,\n\"miss.\"\n\n\"I am interested,\" she said, as they crossed the grass together,\n\"because places like this are quite new to me. I have never been in\nEngland before.\"\n\n\"There are not many places like this,\" he answered, \"not many as old and\nfine, and not many as nearly gone to ruin. Even Stornham is not quite as\nfar gone.\"\n\n\"It is far gone,\" said Miss Vanderpoel. \"I am staying there--with my\nsister, Lady Anstruthers.\"\n\n\"Beg pardon--miss,\" he said. This time he touched his cap in apology.\n\nEnormous as the gulf between their positions was, he knew that he had\noffered to take her over the place because he was in a sense glad to\nsee her again. Why he was glad he did not profess to know or even to\nask himself. Coarsely speaking, it might be because she was one of the\nhandsomest young women he had ever chanced to meet with, and while her\nyouth was apparent in the rich red of her mouth, the mass of her thick,\nsoft hair and the splendid blue of her eyes, there spoke in every line\nof face and pose something intensely more interesting and compelling\nthan girlhood. Also, since the night they had come together on the\nship's deck for an appalling moment, he had liked her better and\nrebelled less against the unnatural wealth she represented. He led her\nfirst to the wood from which she had seen him emerge.\n\n\"I will show you this first,\" he explained. \"Keep your eyes on the\nground until I tell you to raise them.\"\n\nOdd as this was, she obeyed, and her lowered glance showed her that she\nwas being guided along a narrow path between trees. The light was mellow\ngolden-green, and birds were singing in the boughs above her. In a few\nminutes he stopped.\n\n\"Now look up,\" he said.\n\nShe uttered an exclamation when she did so. She was in a fairy dell\nthick with ferns, and at beautiful distances from each other incredibly\nsplendid oaks spread and almost trailed their lovely giant branches. The\nglow shining through and between them, the shadows beneath them, their\ngreat boles and moss-covered roots, and the stately, mellow distances\nrevealed under their branches, the ancient wildness and richness, which\nmeant, after all, centuries of cultivation, made a picture in\nthis exact, perfect moment of ripening afternoon sun of an almost\nunbelievable beauty.\n\n\"There is nothing lovelier,\" he said in a low voice, \"in all England.\"\n\nBettina turned to look at him, because his tone was a curious one for a\nman like himself. He was standing resting on his gun and taking in the\nloveliness with a strange look in his rugged face.\n\n\"You--you love it!\" she said.\n\n\"Yes,\" but with a suggestion of stubborn reluctance in the admission.\n\nShe was rather moved.\n\n\"Have you been keeper here long?\" she asked.\n\n\"No--only a few years. But I have known the place all my life.\"\n\n\"Does Lord Mount Dunstan love it?\"\n\n\"In his way--yes.\"\n\nHe was plainly not disposed to talk of his master. He was perhaps not\non particularly good terms with him. He led her away and volunteered no\nfurther information. He was, upon the whole, uncommunicative. He did not\nonce refer to the circumstance of their having met before. It was\nplain that he had no intention of presuming upon the fact that he, as\na second-class passenger on a ship, had once been forced by accident\nacross the barriers between himself and the saloon deck. He was\nstubbornly resolved to keep his place; so stubbornly that Bettina felt\nthat to broach the subject herself would verge upon offence.\n\nBut the golden ways through which he led her made the afternoon one\nshe knew she should never forget. They wandered through moss walks and\nalleys, through tangled shrubberies bursting into bloom, beneath avenues\nof blossoming horse-chestnuts and scented limes, between thickets of\nbudding red and white may, and jungles of neglected rhododendrons;\nthrough sunken gardens and walled ones, past terraces with broken\nbalustrades of stone, and fallen Floras and Dianas, past moss-grown\nfountains splashing in lovely corners. Arches, overgrown with yet\nunblooming roses, crumbled in their time stained beauty. Stillness\nbrooded over it all, and they met no one. They scarcely broke the\nsilence themselves. The man led the way as one who knew it by heart, and\nBettina followed, not caring for speech herself, because the stillness\nseemed to add a spell of enchantment. What could one say, to a stranger,\nof such beauty so lost and given over to ruin and decay.\n\n\"But, oh!\" she murmured once, standing still, with indrawn breath, \"if\nit were mine!--if it were mine!\" And she said the thing forgetting that\nher guide was a living creature and stood near.\n\nAfterwards her memories of it all seemed to her like the memories of a\ndream. The lack of speech between herself and the man who led her, his\noften averted face, her own sense of the desertedness of each beauteous\nspot she passed through, the mossy paths which gave back no sound of\nfootfalls as they walked, suggested, one and all, unreality. When\nat last they passed through a door half hidden in an ivied wall, and\ncrossing a grassed bowling green, mounted a short flight of broken steps\nwhich led them to a point through which they saw the house through a\nbreak in the trees, this last was the final touch of all. It was a great\nplace, stately in its masses of grey stone to which thick ivy clung.\nTo Bettina it seemed that a hundred windows stared at her with closed,\nblind eyes. All were shuttered but two or three on the lower floors. Not\none showed signs of life. The silent stone thing stood sightless among\nall of which it was dead master--rolling acres, great trees, lost\ngardens and deserted groves.\n\n\"Oh!\" she sighed, \"Oh!\"\n\nHer companion stood still and leaned upon his gun again, looking as he\nhad looked before.\n\n\"Some of it,\" he said, \"was here before the Conquest. It belonged to\nMount Dunstans then.\"\n\n\"And only one of them is left,\" she cried, \"and it is like this!\"\n\n\"They have been a bad lot, the last hundred years,\" was the surly\nliberty of speech he took, \"a bad lot.\"\n\nIt was not his place to speak in such manner of those of his master's\nhouse, and it was not the part of Miss Vanderpoel to encourage him by\nresponse. She remained silent, standing perhaps a trifle more lightly\nerect as she gazed at the rows of blind windows in silence.\n\nNeither of them uttered a word for some time, but at length Bettina\nroused herself. She had a six-mile walk before her and must go.\n\n\"I am very much obliged to you,\" she began, and then paused a second.\nA curious hesitance came upon her, though she knew that under ordinary\ncircumstances such hesitation would have been totally out of place. She\nhad occupied the man's time for an hour or more, he was of the working\nclass, and one must not be guilty of the error of imagining that a man\nwho has work to do can justly spend his time in one's service for the\nmere pleasure of it. She knew what custom demanded. Why should she\nhesitate before this man, with his not too courteous, surly face. She\nfelt slightly irritated by her own unpractical embarrassment as she put\nher hand into the small, latched bag at her belt.\n\n\"I am very much obliged, keeper,\" she said. \"You have given me a\ngreat deal of your time. You know the place so well that it has been\na pleasure to be taken about by you. I have never seen anything so\nbeautiful--and so sad. Thank you--thank you.\" And she put a goldpiece\nin his palm.\n\nHis fingers closed over it quietly. Why it was to her great relief she\ndid not know--because something in the simple act annoyed her, even\nwhile she congratulated herself that her hesitance had been absurd. The\nnext moment she wondered if it could be possible that he had expected\na larger fee. He opened his hand and looked at the money with a grim\nsteadiness.\n\n\"Thank you, miss,\" he said, and touched his cap in the proper manner.\n\nHe did not look gracious or grateful, but he began to put it in a small\npocket in the breast of his worn corduroy shooting jacket. Suddenly he\nstopped, as if with abrupt resolve. He handed the coin back without any\nchange of his glum look.\n\n\"Hang it all,\" he said, \"I can't take this, you know. I suppose I ought\nto have told you. It would have been less awkward for us both. I am that\nunfortunate beggar, Mount Dunstan, myself.\"\n\nA pause was inevitable. It was a rather long one. After it, Betty took\nback her half-sovereign and returned it to her bag, but she pleased a\ncertain perversity in him by looking more annoyed than confused.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"You ought to have told me, Lord Mount Dunstan.\"\n\nHe slightly shrugged his big shoulders.\n\n\n\"Why shouldn't you take me for a keeper? You crossed the Atlantic with\na fourth-rate looking fellow separated from you by barriers of wood\nand iron. You came upon him tramping over a nobleman's estate in shabby\ncorduroys and gaiters, with a gun over his shoulder and a scowl on his\nugly face. Why should you leap to the conclusion that he is the belted\nEarl himself? There is no cause for embarrassment.\"\n\n\"I am not embarrassed,\" said Bettina.\n\n\"That is what I like,\" gruffly.\n\n\"I am pleased,\" in her mellowest velvet voice, \"that you like it.\"\n\nTheir eyes met with a singular directness of gaze. Between them a spark\npassed which was not afterwards to be extinguished, though neither\nof them knew the moment of its kindling, and Mount Dunstan slightly\nfrowned.\n\n\"I beg pardon,\" he said. \"You are quite right. It had a deucedly\npatronising sound.\"\n\nAs he stood before her Betty was given her opportunity to see him as she\nhad not seen him before, to confront the sum total of his physique. His\nred-brown eyes looked out from rather fine heavy brows, his features\nwere strong and clear, though ruggedly cut, his build showed weight\nof bone, not of flesh, and his limbs were big and long. He would have\nwielded a battle-axe with power in centuries in which men hewed their\nway with them. Also it occurred to her he would have looked well in a\ncoat of mail. He did not look ill in his corduroys and gaiters.\n\n\"I am a self-absorbed beggar,\" he went on. \"I had been slouching about\nthe place, almost driven mad by my thoughts, and when I saw you took me\nfor a servant my fancy was for letting the thing go on. If I had been a\nrich man instead of a pauper I would have kept your half-sovereign.\"\n\n\"I should not have enjoyed that when I found out the truth,\" said Miss\nVanderpoel.\n\n\"No, I suppose you wouldn't. But I should not have cared.\"\n\nHe was looking at her straightly and summing her up as she had summed\nhim up. A man and young, he did not miss a line or a tint of her chin or\ncheek, shoulder, or brow, or dense, lifted hair. He had already, even\nin his guise of keeper, noticed one thing, which was that while at times\nher eyes were the blue of steel, sometimes they melted to the colour of\nbluebells under water. They had been of this last hue when she had stood\nin the sunken garden, forgetting him and crying low:\n\n\"Oh, if it were mine! If it were mine!\"\n\nHe did not like American women with millions, but while he would not\nhave said that he liked her, he did not wish her yet to move away. And\nshe, too, did not wish, just yet, to move away. There was something\ndramatic and absorbing in the situation. She looked over the softly\nstirring grass and saw the sunshine was deepening its gold and the\nshadows were growing long. It was not a habit of hers to ask questions,\nbut she asked one.\n\n\"Did you not like America?\" was what she said.\n\n\"Hated it! Hated it! I went there lured by a belief that a man like\nmyself, with muscle and will, even without experience, could make a\nfortune out of small capital on a sheep ranch. Wind and weather and\ndisease played the devil with me. I lost the little I had and came back\nto begin over again--on nothing--here!\" And he waved his hand over the\npark with its sward and coppice and bracken and the deer cropping in the\nlate afternoon gold.\n\n\"To begin what again?\" said Betty. It was an extraordinary enough thing,\nseen in the light of conventions, that they should stand and talk like\nthis. But the spark had kindled between eye and eye, and because of it\nthey suddenly had forgotten that they were strangers.\n\n\"You are an American, so it may not seem as mad to you as it would to\nothers. To begin to build up again, in one man's life, what has taken\ncenturies to grow--and fall into this.\"\n\n\"It would be a splendid thing to do,\" she said slowly, and as she said\nit her eyes took on their colour of bluebells, because what she had seen\nhad moved her. She had not looked at him, but at the cropping deer as\nshe spoke, but at her next sentence she turned to him again.\n\n\"Where should you begin?\" she asked, and in saying it thought of\nStornham.\n\nHe laughed shortly.\n\n\"That is American enough,\" he said. \"Your people have not finished their\nbeginnings yet and live in the spirit of them. I tell you of a wild\nfancy, and you accept it as a possibility and turn on me with, 'Where\nshould you begin?'\"\n\n\"That is one way of beginning,\" said Bettina. \"In fact, it is the only\nway.\"\n\nHe did not tell her that he liked that, but he knew that he did like it\nand that her mere words touched him like a spur. It was, of course, her\nlifelong breathing of the atmosphere of millions which made for this\nfashion of moving at once in the direction of obstacles presenting to\nthe rest of the world barriers seemingly insurmountable. And yet there\nwas something else in it, some quality of nature which did not alone\nsuggest the omnipotence of wealth, but another thing which might be even\nstronger and therefore carried conviction. He who had raged and clenched\nhis hands in the face of his knowledge of the aspect his dream would\nhave presented if he had revealed it to the ordinary practical mind,\nfelt that a point of view like this was good for him. There was in it\nstimulus for a fleeting moment at least.\n\n\"That is a good idea,\" he answered. \"Where should you begin?\"\n\nShe replied quite seriously, though he could have imagined some girls\nrather simpering over the question as a casual joke.\n\n\"One would begin at the fences,\" she said. \"Don't you think so?\"\n\n\"That is practical.\"\n\n\"That is where I shall begin at Stornham,\" reflectively.\n\n\"You are going to begin at Stornham?\"\n\n\"How could one help it? It is not as large or as splendid as this has\nbeen, but it is like it in a way. And it will belong to my sister's son.\nNo, I could not help it.\"\n\n\"I suppose you could not.\" There was a hint of wholly unconscious\nresentment in his tone. He was thinking that the effect produced by\ntheir boundless wealth was to make these people feel as a race of giants\nmight--even their women unknowingly revealed it.\n\n\"No, I could not,\" was her reply. \"I suppose I am on the whole a sort\nof commercial working person. I have no doubt it is commercial, that\ninstinct which makes one resent seeing things lose their value.\"\n\n\"Shall you begin it for that reason?\"\n\n\"Partly for that one--partly for another.\" She held out her hand to him.\n\"Look at the length of the shadows. I must go. Thank you, Lord Mount\nDunstan, for showing me the place, and thank you for undeceiving me.\"\n\nHe held the side gate open for her and lifted his cap as she passed\nthrough. He admitted to himself, with some reluctance, that he was not\ncontent that she should go even yet, but, of course, she must go. There\npassed through his mind a remote wonder why he had suddenly unbosomed\nhimself to her in a way so extraordinarily unlike himself. It was,\nhe thought next, because as he had taken her about from one place to\nanother he had known that she had seen in things what he had seen in\nthem so long--the melancholy loneliness, the significance of it, the\nlost hopes that lay behind it, the touching pain of the stateliness\nwrecked. She had shown it in the way in which she tenderly looked from\nside to side, in the very lightness of her footfall, in the bluebell\nsoftening of her eyes. Oh, yes, she had understood and cared, American\nas she was! She had felt it all, even with her hideous background of\nFifth Avenue behind her.\n\nWhen he had spoken it had been in involuntary response to an emotion in\nherself.\n\nSo he stood, thinking, as he for some time watched her walking up the\nsunset-glowing road.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nTHE PARTICULAR INCIDENT\n\nBetty Vanderpoel's walk back to Stornham did not, long though it was,\ngive her time to follow to its end the thread of her thoughts. Mentally\nshe walked again with her uncommunicative guide, through woodpaths and\ngardens, and stood gazing at the great blind-faced house. She had not\ngiven the man more than an occasional glance until he had told her his\nname. She had been too much absorbed, too much moved, by what she had\nbeen seeing. She wondered, if she had been more aware of him, whether\nhis face would have revealed a great deal. She believed it would not. He\nhad made himself outwardly stolid. But the thing must have been bitter.\nTo him the whole story of the splendid past was familiar even if through\nhis own life he had looked on only at gradual decay. There must be\nstories enough of men and women who had lived in the place, of what they\nhad done, of how they had loved, of what they had counted for in their\ncountry's wars and peacemakings, great functions and law-building. To\nbe able to look back through centuries and know of one's blood that\nsometimes it had been shed in the doing of great deeds, must be a thing\nto remember. To realise that the courage and honour had been lost in\nignoble modern vices, which no sense of dignity and reverence for race\nand name had restrained--must be bitter--bitter! And in the role of a\nservant to lead a stranger about among the ruins of what had been--that\nmust have been bitter, too. For a moment Betty felt the bitterness of it\nherself and her red mouth took upon itself a grim line. The worst of it\nfor him was that he was not of that strain of his race who had been\nthe \"bad lot.\" The \"bad lot\" had been the weak lot, the vicious, the\nself-degrading. Scandals which had shut men out from their class\nand kind were usually of an ugly type. This man had a strong jaw, a\npowerful, healthy body, and clean, though perhaps hard, eyes. The First\nMan of them, who hewed his way to the front, who stood fierce in the\nface of things, who won the first lands and laid the first stones, might\nhave been like him in build and look.\n\n\"It's a disgusting thing,\" she said to herself, \"to think of the corrupt\nweaklings the strong ones dwindled down to. I hate them. So does he.\"\n\nThere had been many such of late years, she knew. She had seen them in\nParis, in Rome, even in New York. Things with thin or over-thick bodies\nand receding chins and foreheads; things haunting places of amusement\nand finding inordinate entertainment in strange jokes and horseplay. She\nherself had hot blood and a fierce strength of rebellion, and she was\nwondering how, if the father and elder brother had been the \"bad lot,\"\nhe had managed to stand still, looking on, and keeping his hands off\nthem.\n\nThe last gold of the sun was mellowing the grey stone of the terrace and\nenriching the green of the weeds thrusting themselves into life between\nthe uneven flags when she reached Stornham, and passing through the\nhouse found Lady Anstruthers sitting there. In sustenance of her effort\nto keep up appearances, she had put on a weird little muslin dress and\nhad elaborated the dressing of her thin hair. It was no longer dragged\nback straight from her face, and she looked a trifle less abject, even a\nshade prettier. Bettina sat upon the edge of the balustrade and touched\nthe hair with light fingers, ruffling it a little becomingly.\n\n\"If you had worn it like this yesterday,\" she said, \"I should have known\nyou.\"\n\n\"Should you, Betty? I never look into a mirror if I can help it, but\nwhen I do I never know myself. The thing that stares back at me with its\npale eyes is not Rosy. But, of course, everyone grows old.\"\n\n\"Not now! People are just discovering how to grow young instead.\"\n\nLady Anstruthers looked into the clear courage of her laughing eyes.\n\n\"Somehow,\" she said, \"you say strange things in such a way that one\nfeels as if they must be true, however--however unlike anything else\nthey are.\"\n\n\"They are not as new as they seem,\" said Betty. \"Ancient philosophers\nsaid things like them centuries ago, but people did not believe them. We\nare just beginning to drag them out of the dust and furbish them up and\npretend they are ours, just as people rub up and adorn themselves with\njewels dug out of excavations.\"\n\n\"In America people think so many new things,\" said poor little Lady\nAnstruthers with yearning humbleness.\n\n\"The whole civilised world is thinking what you call new things,\" said\nBetty. \"The old ones won't do. They have been tried, and though they\nhave helped us to the place we have reached, they cannot help us any\nfarther. We must begin again.\"\n\n\"It is such a long time since I began,\" said Rosy, \"such a long time.\"\n\n\"Then there must be another beginning for you, too. The hour has\nstruck.\"\n\nLady Anstruthers rose with as involuntary a movement as if a strong hand\nhad drawn her to her feet. She stood facing Betty, a pathetic little\nfigure in her washed-out muslin frock and with her washed-out face and\neyes and being, though on her faded cheeks a flush was rising.\n\n\"Oh, Betty!\" she said, \"I don't know what there is about you, but there\nis something which makes one feel as if you believed everything and\ncould do everything, and as if one believes YOU. Whatever you were to\nsay, you would make it seem TRUE. If you said the wildest thing in the\nworld I should BELIEVE you.\"\n\nBetty got up, too, and there was an extraordinary steadiness in her\neyes.\n\n\"You may,\" she answered. \"I shall never say one thing to you which is\nnot a truth, not one single thing.\"\n\n\"I believe that,\" said Rosy Anstruthers, with a quivering mouth. \"I do\nbelieve it so.\"\n\n\"I walked to Mount Dunstan,\" Betty said later.\n\n\"Really?\" said Rosy. \"There and back?\"\n\n\"Yes, and all round the park and the gardens.\"\n\nRosy looked rather uncertain.\n\n\"Weren't you a little afraid of meeting someone?\"\n\n\"I did meet someone. At first I took him for a gamekeeper. But he turned\nout to be Lord Mount Dunstan.\"\n\nLady Anstruthers gasped.\n\n\"What did he do?\" she exclaimed. \"Did he look angry at seeing a\nstranger? They say he is so ill-tempered and rude.\"\n\n\"I should feel ill-tempered if I were in his place,\" said Betty. \"He has\nenough to rouse his evil passions and make him savage. What a fate for a\nman with any sense and decency of feeling! What fools and criminals\nthe last generation of his house must have produced! I wonder how such\nthings evolve themselves. But he is different--different. One can see\nit. If he had a chance--just half a chance--he would build it all up\nagain. And I don't mean merely the place, but all that one means when\none says 'his house.'\"\n\n\"He would need a great deal of money,\" sighed Lady Anstruthers.\n\nBetty nodded slowly as she looked out, reflecting, into the park.\n\n\"Yes, it would require money,\" was her admission.\n\n\"And he has none,\" Lady Anstruthers added. \"None whatever.\"\n\n\"He will get some,\" said Betty, still reflecting. \"He will make it, or\ndig it up, or someone will leave it to him. There is a great deal of\nmoney in the world, and when a strong creature ought to have some of it\nhe gets it.\"\n\n\"Oh, Betty!\" said Rosy. \"Oh, Betty!\"\n\n\"Watch that man,\" said Betty; \"you will see. It will come.\"\n\nLady Anstruthers' mind, working at no time on complex lines, presented\nher with a simple modern solution.\n\n\"Perhaps he will marry an American,\" she said, and saying it, sighed\nagain.\n\n\"He will not do it on purpose.\" Bettina answered slowly and with such an\nair of absence of mind that Rosy laughed a little.\n\n\"Will he do it accidentally, or against his will?\" she said.\n\nBetty herself smiled.\n\n\"Perhaps he will,\" she said. \"There are Englishmen who rather dislike\nAmericans. I think he is one of them.\"\n\nIt apparently became necessary for Lady Anstruthers, a moment later, to\nlean upon the stone balustrade and pick off a young leaf or so, for no\nreason whatever, unless that in doing so she averted her look from her\nsister as she made her next remark.\n\n\"Are you--when are you going to write to father and mother?\"\n\n\"I have written,\" with unembarrassed evenness of tone. \"Mother will be\ncounting the days.\"\n\n\"Mother!\" Rosy breathed, with a soft little gasp. \"Mother!\" and turned\nher face farther away. \"What did you tell her?\"\n\nBetty moved over to her and stood close at her side. The power of her\npersonality enveloped the tremulous creature as if it had been a sense\nof warmth.\n\n\"I told her how beautiful the place was, and how Ughtred adored you--and\nhow you loved us all, and longed to see New York again.\"\n\nThe relief in the poor little face was so immense that Betty's heart\nshook before it. Lady Anstruthers looked up at her with adoring eyes.\n\n\"I might have known,\" she said; \"I might have known that--that you would\nonly say the right thing. You couldn't say the wrong thing, Betty.\"\n\nBetty bent over her and spoke almost yearningly.\n\n\"Whatever happens,\" she said, \"we will take care that mother is not\nhurt. She's too kind--she's too good--she's too tender.\"\n\n\"That is what I have remembered,\" said Lady Anstruthers brokenly. \"She\nused to hold me on her lap when I was quite grown up. Oh! her soft, warm\narms--her warm shoulder! I have so wanted her.\"\n\n\"She has wanted you,\" Betty answered. \"She thinks of you just as she did\nwhen she held you on her lap.\"\n\n\"But if she saw me now--looking like this! If she saw me! Sometimes I\nhave even been glad to think she never would.\"\n\n\"She will.\" Betty's tone was cool and clear. \"But before she does I\nshall have made you look like yourself.\"\n\nLady Anstruthers' thin hand closed on her plucked leaves convulsively,\nand then opening let them drop upon the stone of the terrace.\n\n\"We shall never see each other. It wouldn't be possible,\" she said. \"And\nthere is no magic in the world now, Betty. You can't bring back----\"\n\n\"Yes, you can,\" said Bettina. \"And what used to be called magic is only\nthe controlled working of the law and order of things in these days. We\nmust talk it all over.\"\n\nLady Anstruthers became a little pale.\n\n\"What?\" she asked, low and nervously, and Betty saw her glance sideways\nat the windows of the room which opened on to the terrace.\n\nBetty took her hand and drew her down into a chair. She sat near her and\nlooked her straight in the face.\n\n\"Don't be frightened,\" she said. \"I tell you there is no need to be\nfrightened. We are not living in the Middle Ages. There is a policeman\neven in Stornham village, and we are within four hours of London, where\nthere are thousands.\"\n\nLady Anstruthers tried to laugh, but did not succeed very well, and her\nforehead flushed.\n\n\"I don't quite know why I seem so nervous,\" she said. \"It's very silly\nof me.\"\n\nShe was still timid enough to cling to some rag of pretence, but Betty\nknew that it would fall away. She did the wisest possible thing, which\nwas to make an apparently impersonal remark.\n\n\"I want you to go over the place with me and show me everything. Walls\nand fences and greenhouses and outbuildings must not be allowed to\ncrumble away.\"\n\n\"What?\" cried Rosy. \"Have you seen all that already?\" She actually\nstared at her. \"How practical and--and American!\"\n\n\"To see that a wall has fallen when you find yourself obliged to walk\nround a pile of grass-grown brickwork?\" said Betty.\n\nLady Anstruthers still softly stared.\n\n\"What--what are you thinking of?\" she asked.\n\n\"Thinking that it is all too beautiful----\" Betty's look swept the\nloveliness spread about her, \"too beautiful and too valuable to be\nallowed to lose its value and its beauty.\" She turned her eyes back to\nRosy and the deep dimple near her mouth showed itself delightfully. \"It\nis a throwing away of capital,\" she added.\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Lady Anstruthers, \"how clever you are! And you look so\ndifferent, Betty.\"\n\n\"Do I look stupid?\" the dimple deepening. \"I must try to alter that.\"\n\n\"Don't try to alter your looks,\" said Rosy. \"It is your looks that make\nyou so--so wonderful. But usually women--girls----\" Rosy paused.\n\n\"Oh, I have been trained,\" laughed Betty. \"I am the spoiled daughter of\na business man of genius. His business is an art and a science. I have\nhad advantages. He has let me hear him talk. I even know some trifling\nthings about stocks. Not enough to do me vital injury--but something.\nWhat I know best of all,\"--her laugh ended and her eyes changed\ntheir look,--\"is that it is a blunder to think that beauty is not\ncapital--that happiness is not--and that both are not the greatest\nassets in the scheme. This,\" with a wave of her hand, taking in all they\nsaw, \"is beauty, and it ought to be happiness, and it must be taken care\nof. It is your home and Ughtred's----\"\n\n\"It is Nigel's,\" put in Rosy.\n\n\"It is entailed, isn't it?\" turning quickly. \"He cannot sell it?\"\n\n\"If he could we should not be sitting here,\" ruefully.\n\n\"Then he cannot object to its being rescued from ruin.\"\n\n\"He will object to--to money being spent on things he does not care\nfor.\" Lady Anstruthers' voice lowered itself, as it always did when she\nspoke of her husband, and she indulged in the involuntary hasty glance\nabout her.\n\n\"I am going to my room to take off my hat,\" Betty said. \"Will you come\nwith me?\"\n\nShe went into the house, talking quietly of ordinary things, and in\nthis way they mounted the stairway together and passed along the gallery\nwhich led to her room. When they entered it she closed the door, locked\nit, and, taking off her hat, laid it aside. After doing which she sat.\n\n\"No one can hear and no one can come in,\" she said. \"And if they could,\nyou are afraid of things you need not be afraid of now. Tell me what\nhappened when you were so ill after Ughtred was born.\"\n\n\"You guessed that it happened then,\" gasped Lady Anstruthers.\n\n\n\"It was a good time to make anything happen,\" replied Bettina. \"You were\nprostrated, you were a child, and felt yourself cast off hopelessly from\nthe people who loved you.\"\n\n\"Forever! Forever!\" Lady Anstruthers' voice was a sharp little moan.\n\"That was what I felt--that nothing could ever help me. I dared not\nwrite things. He told me he would not have it--that he would stop any\nhysterical complaints--that his mother could testify that he\nbehaved perfectly to me. She was the only person in the room with us\nwhen--when----\"\n\n\"When?\" said Betty.\n\nLady Anstruthers shuddered. She leaned forward and caught Betty's hand\nbetween her own shaking ones.\n\n\"He struck me! He struck me! He said it never happened--but it did--it\ndid! Betty, it did! That was the one thing that came back to me\nclearest. He said that I was in delirious hysterics, and that I had\nstruggled with his mother and himself, because they tried to keep me\nquiet, and prevent the servants hearing. One awful day he brought Lady\nAnstruthers into the room, and they stood over me, as I lay in bed, and\nshe fixed her eyes on me and said that she--being an Englishwoman, and\na person whose word would be believed, could tell people the truth--my\nfather and mother, if necessary, that my spoiled, hysterical American\ntempers had created unhappiness for me--merely because I was bored by\nlife in the country and wanted excitement. I tried to answer, but they\nwould not let me, and when I began to shake all over, they said that I\nwas throwing myself into hysterics again. And they told the doctor so,\nand he believed it.\"\n\nThe possibilities of the situation were plainly to be seen. Fate, in the\nform of temperament itself, had been against her. It was clear enough to\nBetty as she patted and stroked the thin hands. \"I understand. Tell me\nthe rest,\" she said.\n\nLady Anstruthers' head dropped.\n\n\"When I was loneliest, and dying of homesickness, and so weak that I\ncould not speak without sobbing, he came to me--it was one morning after\nI had been lying awake all night--and he began to seem kinder. He had\nnot been near me for two days, and I had thought I was going to be\nleft to die alone--and mother would never know. He said he had been\nreflecting and that he was afraid that we had misunderstood each\nother--because we belonged to different countries, and had been brought\nup in different ways----\" she paused.\n\n\"And that if you understood his position and considered it, you might\nboth be quite happy,\" Betty gave in quiet termination.\n\nLady Anstruthers started.\n\n\"Oh, you know it all!\" she exclaimed\n\n\"Only because I have heard it before. It is an old trick. And because\nhe seemed kind and relenting, you tried to understand--and signed\nsomething.\"\n\n\"I WANTED to understand. I WANTED to believe. What did it matter which\nof us had the money, if we liked each other and were happy? He told me\nthings about the estate, and about the enormous cost of it, and his bad\nluck, and debts he could not help. And I said that I would do anything\nif--if we could only be like mother and father. And he kissed me and I\nsigned the paper.\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"He went to London the next day, and then to Paris. He said he was\nobliged to go on business. He was away a month. And after a week had\npassed, Lady Anstruthers began to be restless and angry, and once she\nflew into a rage, and told me I was a fool, and that if I had been an\nEnglishwoman, I should have had some decent control over my husband,\nbecause he would have respected me. In time I found out what I had done.\nIt did not take long.\"\n\n\"The paper you signed,\" said Betty, \"gave him control over your money?\"\n\nA forlorn nod was the answer.\n\n\"And since then he has done as he chose, and he has not chosen to care\nfor Stornham. And once he made you write to father, to ask for more\nmoney?\"\n\n\"I did it once. I never would do it again. He has tried to make me. He\nalways says it is to save Stornham for Ughtred.\"\n\n\"Nothing can take Stornham from Ughtred. It may come to him a ruin, but\nit will come to him.\"\n\n\"He says there are legal points I cannot understand. And he says he is\nspending money on it.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"He--doesn't go into that. If I were to ask questions, he would make me\nknow that I had better stop. He says I know nothing about things. And\nhe is right. He has never allowed me to know and--and I am not like you,\nBetty.\"\n\n\"When you signed the paper, you did not realise that you were doing\nsomething you could never undo and that you would be forced to submit to\nthe consequences?\"\n\n\"I--I didn't realise anything but that it would kill me to live as I had\nbeen living--feeling as if they hated me. And I was so glad and thankful\nthat he seemed kinder. It was as if I had been on the rack, and he\nturned the screws back, and I was ready to do anything--anything--if\nI might be taken off. Oh, Betty! you know, don't you, that--that if he\nwould only have been a little kind--just a little--I would have obeyed\nhim always, and given him everything.\"\n\nBetty sat and looked at her, with deeply pondering eyes. She was\nconfronting the fact that it seemed possible that one must build a new\nsoul for her as well as a new body. In these days of science and growing\nsanity of thought, one did not stand helpless before the problem of\nphysical rebuilding, and--and perhaps, if one could pour life into a\ncreature, the soul of it would respond, and wake again, and grow.\n\n\"You do not know where he is?\" she said aloud. \"You absolutely do not\nknow?\"\n\n\"I never know exactly,\" Lady Anstruthers answered. \"He was here for a\nfew days the week before you came. He said he was going abroad. He might\nappear to-morrow, I might not hear of him for six months. I can't help\nhoping now that it will be the six months.\"\n\n\"Why particularly now?\" inquired Betty.\n\nLady Anstruthers flushed and looked shy and awkward.\n\n\"Because of--you. I don't know what he would say. I don't know what he\nwould do.\"\n\n\"To me?\" said Betty.\n\n\"It would be sure to be something unreasonable and wicked,\" said Lady\nAnstruthers. \"It would, Betty.\"\n\n\"I wonder what it would be?\" Betty said musingly.\n\n\"He has told lies for years to keep you all from me. If he came now, he\nwould know that he had been found out. He would say that I had told you\nthings. He would be furious because you have seen what there is to see.\nHe would know that you could not help but realise that the money he made\nme ask for had not been spent on the estate. He,--Betty, he would try to\nforce you to go away.\"\n\n\"I wonder what he would do?\" Betty said again musingly. She felt\ninterested, not afraid.\n\n\"It would be something cunning,\" Rosy protested. \"It would be something\nno one could expect. He might be so rude that you could not remain\nin the room with him, or he might be quite polite, and pretend he was\nrather glad to see you. If he was only frightfully rude we should be\nsafer, because that would not be an unexpected thing, but if he was\npolite, it would be because he was arranging something hideous, which\nyou could not defend yourself against.\"\n\n\"Can you tell me,\" said Betty quite slowly, because, as she looked down\nat the carpet, she was thinking very hard, \"the kind of unexpected thing\nhe has done to you?\" Lifting her eyes, she saw that a troubled flush was\ncreeping over Lady Anstruthers' face.\n\n\"There--have been--so many queer things,\" she faltered. Then Betty knew\nthere was some special thing she was afraid to talk about, and that if\nshe desired to obtain illuminating information it would be well to go\ninto the matter.\n\n\"Try,\" she said, \"to remember some particular incident.\"\n\nLady Anstruthers looked nervous.\n\n\"Rosy,\" in the level voice, \"there has been a particular incident--and I\nwould rather hear of it from you than from him.\"\n\nRosy's lap held little shaking hands.\n\n\"He has held it over me for years,\" she said breathlessly. \"He said\nhe would write about it to father and mother. He says he could use it\nagainst me as evidence in--in the divorce court. He says that divorce\ncourts in America are for women, but in England they are for men,\nand--he could defend himself against me.\"\n\nThe incongruity of the picture of the small, faded creature arraigned in\na divorce court on charges of misbehaviour would have made Betty smile\nif she had been in smiling mood.\n\n\"What did he accuse you of?\"\n\n\"That was the--the unexpected thing,\" miserably.\n\nBetty took the unsteady hands firmly in her own.\n\n\"Don't be afraid to tell me,\" she said. \"He knew you so well that he\nunderstood what would terrify you the most. I know you so well that I\nunderstand how he does it. Did he do this unexpected thing just before\nyou wrote to father for the money?\" As she quite suddenly presented the\nquestion, Rosy exclaimed aloud.\n\n\n\"How did you know?\" she said. \"You--you are like a lawyer. How could you\nknow?\"\n\nHow simple she was! How obviously an easy prey! She had been\nunconsciously giving evidence with every word.\n\n\"I have been thinking him over,\" Betty said. \"He interests me. I have\nbegun to guess that he always wants something when he professes that he\nhas a grievance.\"\n\nThen with drooping head, Rosy told the story.\n\n\"Yes, it happened before he made me write to father for so much money.\nThe vicar was ill and was obliged to go away for six months. The\nclergyman who came to take his place was a young man. He was kind and\ngentle, and wanted to help people. His mother was with him and she was\nlike him. They loved each other, and they were quite poor. His name was\nFfolliott. I liked to hear him preach. He said things that comforted me.\nNigel found out that he comforted me, and--when he called here, he was\nmore polite to him than he had ever been to Mr. Brent. He seemed almost\nas if he liked him. He actually asked him to dinner two or three times.\nAfter dinner, he would go out of the room and leave us together. Oh,\nBetty!\" clinging to her hands, \"I was so wretched then, that sometimes\nI thought I was going out of my mind. I think I looked wild. I used to\nkneel down and try to pray, and I could not.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Betty.\n\n\"I used to feel that if I could only have one friend, just one, I\ncould bear it better. Once I said something like that to Nigel. He only\nshrugged his shoulders and sneered when I said it. But afterwards I\nknew he had remembered. One evening, when he had asked Mr. Ffolliott to\ndinner, he led him to talk about religion. Oh, Betty! It made my blood\nturn cold when he began. I knew he was doing it for some wicked reason.\nI knew the look in his eyes and the awful, agreeable smile on his mouth.\nWhen he said at last, 'If you could help my poor wife to find comfort in\nsuch things,' I began to see. I could not explain to anyone how he did\nit, but with just a sentence, dropped here and there, he seemed to tell\nthe whole story of a silly, selfish, American girl, thwarted in her\nvulgar little ambitions, and posing as a martyr, because she could\nnot have her own way in everything. He said once, quite casually, 'I'm\nafraid American women are rather spoiled.' And then he said, in the\nsame tolerant way--'A poor man is a disappointment to an American girl.\nAmerica does not believe in rank combined with lack of fortune.' I dared\nnot defend myself. I am not clever enough to think of the right things\nto say. He meant Mr. Ffolliott to understand that I had married him\nbecause I thought he was grand and rich, and that I was a disappointed\nlittle spiteful shrew. I tried to act as if he was not hurting me, but\nmy hands trembled, and a lump kept rising in my throat. When we returned\nto the drawing-room, and at last he left us together, I was praying and\npraying that I might be able to keep from breaking down.\"\n\nShe stopped and swallowed hard. Betty held her hands firmly until she\nwent on.\n\n\"For a few minutes, I sat still, and tried to think of some new\nsubject--something about the church or the village. But I could not\nbegin to speak because of the lump in my throat. And then, suddenly, but\nquietly, Mr. Ffolliott got up. And though I dared not lift my eyes, I\nknew he was standing before the fire, quite near me. And, oh! what do\nyou think he said, as low and gently as if his voice was a woman's.\nI did not know that people ever said such things now, or even thought\nthem. But never, never shall I forget that strange minute. He said just\nthis:\n\n\"'God will help you. He will. He will.'\n\n\"As if it was true, Betty! As if there was a God--and--He had not\nforgotten me. I did not know what I was doing, but I put out my hand and\ncaught at his sleeve, and when I looked up into his face, I saw in\nhis kind, good eyes, that he knew--that somehow--God knows how--he\nunderstood and that I need not utter a word to explain to him that he\nhad been listening to lies.\"\n\n\"Did you talk to him?\" Betty asked quietly.\n\n\"He talked to me. We did not even speak of Nigel. He talked to me as\nI had never heard anyone talk before. Somehow he filled the room with\nsomething real, which was hope and comfort and like warmth, which kept\nmy soul from shivering. The tears poured from my eyes at first, but the\nlump in my throat went away, and when Nigel came back I actually did not\nfeel frightened, though he looked at me and sneered quietly.\"\n\n\"Did he say anything afterwards?\"\n\n\"He laughed a little cold laugh and said, 'I see you have been seeking\nthe consolation of religion. Neurotic women like confessors. I do not\nobject to your confessing, if you confess your own backslidings and not\nmine.'\"\n\n\"That was the beginning,\" said Betty speculatively. \"The unexpected\nthing was the end. Tell me the rest?\"\n\n\"No one could have dreamed of it,\" Rosy broke forth. \"For weeks he was\nalmost like other people. He stayed at Stornham and spent his days in\nshooting. He professed that he was rather enjoying himself in a dull\nway. He encouraged me to go to the vicarage, he invited the Ffolliotts\nhere. He said Mrs. Ffolliott was a gentlewoman and good for me. He said\nit was proper that I should interest myself in parish work. Once or\ntwice he even brought some little message to me from Mr. Ffolliott.\"\n\nIt was a pitiably simple story. Betty saw, through its relation, the\nunconsciousness of the easily allured victim, the adroit leading on\nfrom step to step, the ordinary, natural, seeming method which arranged\nopportunities. The two had been thrown together at the Court, at the\nvicarage, the church and in the village, and the hawk had looked on and\nbided his time. For the first time in her years of exile, Rosy had begun\nto feel that she might be allowed a friend--though she lived in secret\ntremor lest the normal liberty permitted her should suddenly be snatched\naway.\n\n\"We never talked of Nigel,\" she said, twisting her hands. \"But he made\nme begin to live again. He talked to me of Something that watched and\nwould not leave me--would never leave me. I was learning to believe it.\nSometimes when I walked through the wood to the village, I used to stop\namong the trees and look up at the bits of sky between the branches, and\nlisten to the sound in the leaves--the sound that never stops--and it\nseemed as if it was saying something to me. And I would clasp my hands\nand whisper, 'Yes, yes,' 'I will,' 'I will.' I used to see Nigel looking\nat me at table with a queer smile in his eyes and once he said\nto me--'You are growing young and lovely, my dear. Your colour is\nimproving. The counsels of our friend are of a salutary nature.' It\nwould have made me nervous, but he said it almost good-naturedly, and I\nwas silly enough even to wonder if it could be possible that he was\npleased to see me looking less ill. It was true, Betty, that I was\ngrowing stronger. But it did not last long.\"\n\n\"I was afraid not,\" said Betty.\n\n\"An old woman in the lane near Bartyon Wood was ill. Mr. Ffolliott had\nasked me to go to see her, and I used to go. She suffered a great deal\nand clung to us both. He comforted her, as he comforted me. Sometimes\nwhen he was called away he would send a note to me, asking me to go to\nher. One day he wrote hastily, saying that she was dying, and asked if I\nwould go with him to her cottage at once. I knew it would save time if\nI met him in the path which was a short cut. So I wrote a few words and\ngave them to the messenger. I said, 'Do not come to the house. I will\nmeet you in Bartyon Wood.'\"\n\nBetty made a slight movement, and in her face there was a dawning of\nmingled amazement and incredulity. The thought which had come to her\nseemed--as Ughtred's locking of the door had seemed--too wild for modern\ndays.\n\nLady Anstruthers saw her expression and understood it. She made a\nhopeless gesture with her small, bony hand.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"it is just like that. No one would believe it. The\nworst cleverness of the things he does, is that when one tells of them,\nthey sound like lies. I have a bewildered feeling that I should not\nbelieve them myself if I had not seen them. He met the boy in the park\nand took the note from him. He came back to the house and up to my room,\nwhere I was dressing quickly to go to Mr. Ffolliott.\"\n\nShe stopped for quite a minute, rather as if to recover breath.\n\n\"He closed the door behind him and came towards me with the note in his\nhand. And I saw in a second the look that always terrifies me, in his\nface. He had opened the note and he smoothed out the paper quietly and\nsaid, 'What is this?' I could not help it--I turned cold and began to\nshiver. I could not imagine what was coming.\"\n\n\"'Is it my note to Mr. Ffolliott?' I asked.\n\n\"'Yes, it is your note to Mr. Ffolliott,' and he read it aloud. \"Do\nnot come to the house. I will meet you in Bartyon Wood.\" That is a nice\nnote for a man's wife to have written, to be picked up and read by a\nstranger, if your confessor is not cautious in the matter of letters\nfrom women----'\n\n\"When he begins a thing in that way, you may always know that he has\nplanned everything--that you can do nothing--I always know. I knew then,\nand I knew I was quite white when I answered him:\n\n\"'I wrote it in a great hurry, Mrs. Farne is worse. We are going\ntogether to her. I said I would meet him--to save time.'\n\n\"He laughed, his awful little laugh, and touched the paper.\n\n\"'I have no doubt. And I have no doubt that if other persons saw this,\nthey would believe it. It is very likely.\n\n\"'But you believe it,' I said. 'You know it is true. No one would be so\nsilly--so silly and wicked as to----' Then I broke down and cried out.\n'What do you mean? What could anyone think it meant?' I was so wild that\nI felt as if I was going crazy. He clenched my wrist and shook me.\n\n\"'Don't think you can play the fool with me,' he said. 'I have been\nwatching this thing from the first. The first time I leave you alone\nwith the fellow, I come back to find you have been giving him an\nemotional scene. Do you suppose your simpering good spirits and your\nimbecile pink cheeks told me nothing? They told me exactly this. I have\nwaited to come upon it, and here it is. \"Do not come to the house--I\nwill meet you in the wood.\"'\n\n\"That was the unexpected thing. It was no use to argue and try to\nexplain. I knew he did not believe what he was saying, but he worked\nhimself into a rage, he accused me of awful things, and called me awful\nnames in a loud voice, so that he could be heard, until I was dumb and\nstaggering. All the time, I knew there was a reason, but I could\nnot tell then what it was. He said at last, that he was going to Mr.\nFfolliott. He said, 'I will meet him in the wood and I will take your\nnote with me.'\n\n\"Betty, it was so shameful that I fell down on my knees. 'Oh,\ndon't--don't--do that,' I said. 'I beg of you, Nigel. He is a gentleman\nand a clergyman. I beg and beg of you. If you will not, I will do\nanything--anything.' And at that minute I remembered how he had tried\nto make me write to father for money. And I cried out--catching at his\ncoat, and holding him back. 'I will write to father as you asked me. I\nwill do anything. I can't bear it.'\"\n\n\"That was the whole meaning of the whole thing,\" said Betty with eyes\nablaze. \"That was the beginning, the middle and the end. What did he\nsay?\"\n\n\"He pretended to be made more angry. He said, 'Don't insult me by trying\nto bribe me with your vulgar money. Don't insult me.' But he gradually\ngrew sulky instead of raging, and though he put the note in his pocket,\nhe did not go to Mr. Ffolliott. And--I wrote to father.\"\n\n\"I remember that,\" Betty answered. \"Did you ever speak to Mr. Ffolliott\nagain?\"\n\n\"He guessed--he knew--I saw it in his kind, brown eyes when he passed\nme without speaking, in the village. I daresay the villagers were\ntold about the awful thing by some servant, who heard Nigel's voice.\nVillagers always know what is happening. He went away a few weeks later.\nThe day before he went, I had walked through the wood, and just outside\nit, I met him. He stopped for one minute--just one--he lifted his hat\nand said, just as he had spoken them that first night--just the same\nwords, 'God will help you. He will. He will.'\"\n\nA strange, almost unearthly joy suddenly flashed across her face.\n\n\"It must be true,\" she said. \"It must be true. He has sent you, Betty.\nIt has been a long time--it has been so long that sometimes I have\nforgotten his words. But you have come!\"\n\n\"Yes, I have come,\" Betty answered. And she bent forward and kissed her\ngently, as if she had been soothing a child.\n\nThere were other questions to ask. She was obliged to ask them. \"The\nunexpected thing\" had been used as an instrument for years. It was\nalways efficacious. Over the yearningly homesick creature had hung the\nthreat that her father and mother, those she ached and longed for, could\nbe told the story in such a manner as would brand her as a woman with\na shameful secret. How could she explain herself? There were the awful,\nwritten words. He was her husband. He was remorseless, plausible. She\ndared not write freely. She had no witnesses to call upon. She had\ndiscovered that he had planned with composed steadiness that misleading\nimpressions should be given to servants and village people. When the\nBrents returned to the vicarage, she had observed, with terror, that for\nsome reason they stiffened, and looked askance when the Ffolliotts were\nmentioned.\n\n\"I am afraid, Lady Anstruthers, that Mr. Ffolliott was a great mistake,\"\nMrs. Brent said once.\n\nLady Anstruthers had not dared to ask any questions. She had felt the\nawkward colour rising in her face and had known that she looked guilty.\nBut if she had protested against the injustice of the remark, Sir\nNigel would have heard of her words before the day had passed, and she\nshuddered to think of the result. He had by that time reached the point\nof referring to Ffolliott with sneering lightness, as \"Your lover.\"\n\n\"Do you defend your lover to me,\" he had said on one occasion, when she\nhad entered a timid protest. And her white face and wild helpless eyes\nhad been such evidence as to the effect the word had produced, that he\nhad seen the expediency of making a point of using it.\n\nThe blood beat in Betty Vanderpoel's veins.\n\n\"Rosy,\" she said, looking steadily in the faded face, \"tell me this. Did\nyou never think of getting away from him, of going somewhere, and trying\nto reach father, by cable, or letter, by some means?\"\n\nLady Anstruthers' weary and wrinkled little smile was a pitiably\nilluminating thing.\n\n\"My dear\" she said, \"if you are strong and beautiful and rich and well\ndressed, so that people care to look at you, and listen to what you say,\nyou can do things. But who, in England, will listen to a shabby, dowdy,\nfrightened woman, when she runs away from her husband, if he follows\nher and tells people she is hysterical or mad or bad? It is the shabby,\ndowdy woman who is in the wrong. At first, I thought of nothing else but\ntrying to get away. And once I went to Stornham station. I walked all\nthe way, on a hot day. And just as I was getting into a third-class\ncarriage, Nigel marched in and caught my arm, and held me back. I\nfainted and when I came to myself I was in the carriage, being driven\nback to the Court, and he was sitting opposite to me. He said, 'You\nfool! It would take a cleverer woman than you to carry that out.' And I\nknew it was the awful truth.\"\n\n\"It is not the awful truth now,\" said Betty, and she rose to her feet\nand stood looking before her, but with a look which did not rest on\nchairs and tables. She remained so, standing for a few moments of dead\nsilence.\n\n\"What a fool he was!\" she said at last. \"And what a villain! But a\nvillain is always a fool.\"\n\nShe bent, and taking Rosy's face between her hands, kissed it with a\nkiss which seemed like a seal. \"That will do,\" she said. \"Now I know.\nOne must know what is in one's hands and what is not. Then one need not\nwaste time in talking of miserable things. One can save one's strength\nfor doing what can be done.\"\n\n\"I believe you would always think about DOING things,\" said Lady\nAnstruthers. \"That is American, too.\"\n\n\"It is a quality Americans inherited from England,\" lightly; \"one of the\nresults of it is that England covers a rather large share of the map\nof the world. It is a practical quality. You and I might spend hours in\ntalking to each other of what Nigel has done and what you have done, of\nwhat he has said, and of what you have said. We might give some hours, I\ndaresay, to what the Dowager did and said. But wiser people than we are\nhave found out that thinking of black things past is living them again,\nand it is like poisoning one's blood. It is deterioration of property.\"\n\nShe said the last words as if she had ended with a jest. But she knew\nwhat she was doing.\n\n\"You were tricked into giving up what was yours, to a person who could\nnot be trusted. What has been done with it, scarcely matters. It is not\nyours, but Sir Nigel's. But we are not helpless, because we have in our\nhands the most powerful material agent in the world.\n\n\"Come, Rosy, and let us walk over the house. We will begin with that.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nTOWNLINSON & SHEPPARD\n\nDuring the whole course of her interesting life--and she had always\nfound life interesting--Betty Vanderpoel decided that she had known\nno experience more absorbing than this morning spent in going over the\nlong-closed and deserted portions of the neglected house. She had never\nseen anything like the place, or as full of suggestion. The greater\npart of it had simply been shut up and left to time and weather, both of\nwhich had had their effects. The fine old red roof, having lost tiles,\nhad fallen into leaks that let in rain, which had stained and rotted\nwalls, plaster, and woodwork; wind and storm had beaten through broken\nwindow panes and done their worst with such furniture and hangings as\nthey found to whip and toss and leave damp and spotted with mould. They\npassed through corridors, and up and down short or long stairways, with\nstained or faded walls, and sometimes with cracked or fallen plastering\nand wainscotting. Here and there the oak flooring itself was uncertain.\nThe rooms, whether large or small, all presented a like aspect of\npotential beauty and comfort, utterly uncared for and forlorn. There\nwere many rooms, but none more than scantily furnished, and a number of\nthem were stripped bare. Betty found herself wondering how long a time\nit had taken the belongings of the big place to dwindle and melt away\ninto such bareness.\n\n\"There was a time, I suppose, when it was all furnished,\" she said.\n\n\"All these rooms were shut up when I came here,\" Rosy answered. \"I\nsuppose things worth selling have been sold. When pieces of furniture\nwere broken in one part of the house, they were replaced by things\nbrought from another. No one cared. Nigel hates it all. He calls it a\nrathole. He detests the country everywhere, but particularly this part\nof it. After the first year I had learned better than to speak to him of\nspending money on repairs.\"\n\n\"A good deal of money should be spent on repairs,\" reflected Betty,\nlooking about her.\n\nShe was standing in the middle of a room whose walls were hung with\nthe remains of what had been chintz, covered with a pattern of loose\nclusters of moss rosebuds. The dampness had rotted it until, in some\nplaces, it had fallen away in strips from its fastenings. A quaint,\nembroidered couch stood in one corner, and as Betty looked at it, a\nmouse crept from under the tattered valance, stared at her in alarm\nand suddenly darted back again, in terror of intrusion so unusual. A\ncasement window swung open, on a broken hinge, and a strong branch of\nivy, having forced its way inside, had thrown a covering of leaves over\nthe deep ledge, and was beginning to climb the inner woodwork. Through\nthe casement was to be seen a heavenly spread of country, whose rolling\nlands were clad softly in green pastures and thick-branched trees.\n\n\"This is the Rosebud Boudoir,\" said Lady Anstruthers, smiling faintly.\n\"All the rooms have names. I thought them so delightful, when I first\nheard them. The Damask Room--the Tapestry Room--the White Wainscot\nRoom--My Lady's Chamber. It almost broke my heart when I saw what they\nlooked like.\"\n\n\"It would be very interesting,\" Betty commented slowly, \"to make them\nlook as they ought to look.\"\n\nA remote fear rose to the surface of the expression in Lady Anstruthers'\neyes. She could not detach herself from certain recollections of\nNigel--of his opinions of her family--of his determination not to allow\nit to enter as a factor in either his life or hers. And Betty had come\nto Stornham--Betty whom he had detested as a child--and in the course of\ntwo days, she had seemed to become a new part of the atmosphere, and to\nmake the dead despair of the place begin to stir with life. What other\nthing than this was happening as she spoke of making such rooms as the\nRosebud Boudoir \"look as they ought to look,\" and said the words not\nas if they were part of a fantastic vision, but as if they expressed a\nperfectly possible thing?\n\nBetty saw the doubt in her eyes, and in a measure, guessed at its\nmeaning. The time to pause for argument had, however not arrived. There\nwas too much to be investigated, too much to be seen. She swept her on\nher way. They wandered on through some forty rooms, more or less; they\nopened doors and closed them; they unbarred shutters and let the sun\nstream in on dust and dampness and cobwebs. The comprehension of the\nsituation which Betty gained was as valuable as it was enlightening.\n\nThe descent into the lower part of the house was a new experience. Betty\nhad not before seen huge, flagged kitchens, vaulted servants' halls,\nstone passages, butteries and dairies. The substantial masonry of the\nwalls and arched ceilings, the stone stairway, and the seemingly\nendless offices, were interestingly remote in idea from such domestic\nmodernities as chance views of up-to-date American household workings\nhad provided her.\n\nIn the huge kitchen itself, an elderly woman, rolling pastry, paused to\ncurtsy to them, with stolid curiosity in her heavy-featured face. In her\ncharacter as \"single-handed\" cook, Mrs. Noakes had sent up uninviting\nmeals to Lady Anstruthers for several years, but she had not seen her\nladyship below stairs before. And this was the unexpected arrival--the\nyoung lady there had been \"talk of\" from the moment of her appearance.\nMrs. Noakes admitted with the grudgingness of a person of uncheerful\ntemperament, that looks like that always would make talk. A certain\ndegree of vague mental illumination led her to agree with Robert, the\nfootman, that the stranger's effectiveness was, perhaps, also, not\naltogether a matter of good looks, and certainly it was not an affair\nof clothes. Her brightish blue dress, of rough cloth, was nothing\nparticular, notwithstanding the fit of it. There was \"something else\nabout her.\" She looked round the place, not with the casual indifference\nof a fine young lady, carelessly curious to see what she had not seen\nbefore, but with an alert, questioning interest.\n\n\"What a big place,\" she said to her ladyship. \"What substantial walls!\nWhat huge joints must have been roasted before such a fireplace.\"\n\nShe drew near to the enormous, antiquated cooking place.\n\n\"People were not very practical when this was built,\" she said. \"It\nlooks as if it must waste a great deal of coal. Is it----?\" she looked\nat Mrs. Noakes. \"Do you like it?\"\n\nThere was a practical directness in the question for which Mrs. Noakes\nwas not prepared. Until this moment, it had apparently mattered little\nwhether she liked things or not. The condition of her implements of\ntrade was one of her grievances--the ancient fireplace and ovens the\nbitterest.\n\n\"It's out of order, miss,\" she answered. \"And they don't use 'em like\nthis in these days.\"\n\n\"I thought not,\" said Miss Vanderpoel.\n\nShe made other inquiries as direct and significant of the observing eye,\nand her passage through the lower part of the establishment left Mrs.\nNoakes and her companions in a strange but not unpleasurable state of\nferment.\n\n\"Think of a young lady that's never had nothing to do with kitchens,\ngoing straight to that shameful old fireplace, and seeing what it meant\nto the woman that's got to use it. 'Do you like it?' she says. If she'd\nbeen a cook herself, she couldn't have put it straighter. She's got\neyes.\"\n\n\"She's been using them all over the place,\" said Robert. \"Her and her\nladyship's been into rooms that's not been opened for years.\"\n\n\"More shame to them that should have opened 'em,\" remarked Mrs. Noakes.\n\"Her ladyship's a poor, listless thing--but her spirit was broken long\nago.\n\n\"This one will mend it for her, perhaps,\" said the man servant. \"I\nwonder what's going to happen.\"\n\n\"Well, she's got a look with her--the new one--as if where she was\nthings would be likely to happen. You look out. The place won't seem so\ndead and alive if we've got something to think of and expect.\"\n\n\"Who are the solicitors Sir Nigel employs?\" Betty had asked her sister,\nwhen their pilgrimage through the house had been completed.\n\nMessrs. Townlinson & Sheppard, a firm which for several generations\nhad transacted the legal business of much more important estates than\nStornham, held its affairs in hand. Lady Anstruthers knew nothing of\nthem, but that they evidently did not approve of the conduct of their\nclient. Nigel was frequently angry when he spoke of them. It could be\ngathered that they had refused to allow him to do things he wished to\ndo--sell things, or borrow money on them.\n\n\"I think we must go to London and see them,\" Betty suggested.\n\nRosy was agitated. Why should one see them? What was there to be\nspoken of? Their going, Betty explained would be a sort of visit of\nceremony--in a measure a precaution. Since Sir Nigel was apparently not\nto be reached, having given no clue as to where he intended to go, it\nmight be discreet to consult Messrs. Townlinson & Sheppard with regard\nto the things it might be well to do--the repairs it appeared necessary\nto make at once. If Messrs. Townlinson & Sheppard approved of the doing\nof such work, Sir Nigel could not resent their action, and say that in\nhis absence liberties had been taken. Such a course seemed businesslike\nand dignified.\n\nIt was what Betty felt that her father would do. Nothing could be\ncomplained of, which was done with the knowledge and under the sanction\nof the family solicitors.\n\n\"Then there are other things we must do. We must go to shops and\ntheatres. It will be good for you to go to shops and theatres, Rosy.\"\n\n\"I have nothing but rags to wear,\" answered Lady Anstruthers, reddening.\n\n\"Then before we go we will have things sent down. People can be sent\nfrom the shops to arrange what we want.\"\n\nThe magic of the name, standing for great wealth, could, it was true,\nbring to them, not only the contents of shops, but the people who showed\nthem, and were ready to carry out any orders. The name of Vanderpoel\nalready stood, in London, for inexhaustible resource. Yes, it was simple\nenough to send for politely subservient saleswomen to bring what one\nwanted.\n\nThe being reminded in every-day matters of the still real existence of\nthe power of this magic was the first step in the rebuilding of Lady\nAnstruthers. To realise that the wonderful and yet simple necromancy\nwas gradually encircling her again, had its parallel in the taking of\na tonic, whose effect was cumulative. She herself did not realise the\nworking of it. But Betty regarded it with interest. She saw it was good\nfor her, merely to look on at the unpacking of the New York boxes, which\nthe maid, sent for from London, brought down with her.\n\nAs the woman removed, from tray after tray, the tissue-paper-enfolded\nlayers of garments, Lady Anstruthers sat and watched her with normal,\nsimply feminine interest growing in her eyes. The things were made\nwith the absence of any limit in expenditure, the freedom with delicate\nstuffs and priceless laces which belonged only to her faint memories of\na lost past.\n\nNothing had limited the time spent in the embroidering of this\napparently simple linen frock and coat; nothing had restrained the\nhand holding the scissors which had cut into the lace which adorned in\nappliques and filmy frills this exquisitely charming ball dress.\n\n\"It is looking back so far,\" she said, waving her hand towards them with\nan odd gesture. \"To think that it was once all like--like that.\"\n\nShe got up and went to the things, turning them over, and touching them\nwith a softness, almost expressing a caress. The names of the makers\nstamped on bands and collars, the names of the streets in which their\nshops stood, moved her. She heard again the once familiar rattle of\nwheels, and the rush and roar of New York traffic.\n\nBetty carried on the whole matter with lightness. She talked easily\nand casually, giving local colour to what she said. She described the\nabnormally rapid growth of the places her sister had known in her teens,\nthe new buildings, new theatres, new shops, new people, the later\nmode of living, much of it learned from England, through the unceasing\nweaving of the Shuttle.\n\n\"Changing--changing--changing. That is what it is always doing--America.\nWe have not reached repose yet. One wonders how long it will be before\nwe shall. Now we are always hurrying breathlessly after the next\nthing--the new one--which we always think will be the better one. Other\ncountries built themselves slowly. In the days of their building, the\npace of life was a march. When America was born, the march had already\nbegun to hasten, and as a nation we began, in our first hour, at the\nquickening speed. Now the pace is a race. New York is a kaleidoscope.\nI myself can remember it a wholly different thing. One passes down a\nstreet one day, and the next there is a great gap where some building\nis being torn down--a few days later, a tall structure of some sort\nis touching the sky. It is wonderful, but it does not tend to calm the\nmind. That is why we cross the Atlantic so much. The sober, quiet-loving\nblood our forbears brought from older countries goes in search of rest.\nMixed with other things, I feel in my own being a resentment\nagainst newness and disorder, and an insistence on the atmosphere of\nlong-established things.\"\n\nBut for years Lady Anstruthers had been living in the atmosphere of\nlong-established things, and felt no insistence upon it. She yearned to\nhear of the great, changing Western world--of the great, changing city.\nBetty must tell her what the changes were. What were the differences\nin the streets--where had the new buildings been placed? How had Fifth\nAvenue and Madison Avenue and Broadway altered? Were not Gramercy\nPark and Madison Square still green with grass and trees? Was it all\ndifferent? Would she not know the old places herself? Though it seemed a\nlifetime since she had seen them, the years which had passed were really\nnot so many.\n\nIt was good for her to talk and be talked to in this manner Betty saw.\nStill handling her subject lightly, she presented picture after picture.\nSome of them were of the wonderful, feverish city itself--the place\nquite passionately loved by some, as passionately disliked by others.\nShe herself had fallen into the habit, as she left childhood behind her,\nof looking at it with interested wonder--at its riot of life and power,\nof huge schemes, and almost superhuman labours, of fortunes so colossal\nthat they seemed monstrosities in their relation to the world. People\nwho in Rosalie's girlhood had lived in big ugly brownstone fronts, had\nbuilt for themselves or for their children, houses such as, in other\ncountries, would have belonged to nobles and princes, spending fortunes\nupon their building, filling them with treasures brought from foreign\nlands, from palaces, from art galleries, from collectors. Sometimes\nstrange people built such houses and lived strange lavish, ostentatious\nlives in them, forming an overstrained, abnormal, pleasure-chasing world\nof their own. The passing of even ten years in New York counted itself\nalmost as a generation; the fashions, customs, belongings of twenty\nyears ago wore an air of almost picturesque antiquity.\n\n\"It does not take long to make an 'old New Yorker,'\" she said. \"Each\nday brings so many new ones.\"\n\nThere were, indeed, many new ones, Lady Anstruthers found. People who\nhad been poor had become hugely rich, a few who had been rich had\nbecome poor, possessions which had been large had swelled to unnatural\nproportions. Out of the West had risen fortunes more monstrous than all\nothers. As she told one story after another, Bettina realised, as she\nhad done often before, that it was impossible to enter into description\nof the life and movements of the place, without its curiously involving\nsome connection with the huge wealth of it--with its influence, its\nrise, its swelling, or waning.\n\n\"Somehow one cannot free one's self from it. This is the age of\nwealth and invention--but of wealth before all else. Sometimes one is\ntired--tired of it.\"\n\n\"You would not be tired of it if--well, if you were I, said Lady\nAnstruthers rather pathetically.\n\n\"Perhaps not,\" Betty answered. \"Perhaps not.\"\n\nShe herself had seen people who were not tired of it in the sense in\nwhich she was--the men and women, with worn or intently anxious faces,\nhastening with the crowds upon the pavements, all hastening somewhere,\nin chase of that small portion of the wealth which they earned by their\nlabour as their daily share; the same men and women surging towards\nelevated railroad stations, to seize on places in the homeward-bound\ntrains; or standing in tired-looking groups, waiting for the approach of\nan already overfull street car, in which they must be packed together,\nand swing to the hanging straps, to keep upon their feet. Their way of\nbeing weary of it would be different from hers, they would be weary\nonly of hearing of the mountains of it which rolled themselves up, as it\nseemed, in obedience to some irresistible, occult force.\n\nOn the day after Stornham village had learned that her ladyship and Miss\nVanderpoel had actually gone to London, the dignified firm of Townlinson\n& Sheppard received a visit which created some slight sensation in\ntheir establishment, though it had not been entirely unexpected. It had,\nindeed, been heralded by a note from Miss Vanderpoel herself, who\nhad asked that the appointment be made. Men of Messrs. Townlinson &\nSheppard's indubitable rank in their profession could not fail to know\nthe significance of the Vanderpoel name. They knew and understood its\nweight perfectly well. When their client had married one of Reuben\nVanderpoel's daughters, they had felt that extraordinary good fortune\nhad befallen him and his estate. Their private opinion had been that Mr.\nVanderpoel's knowledge of his son-in-law must have been limited, or\nthat he had curiously lax American views of paternal duty. The firm was\nhighly reputable, long established strictly conservative, and somewhat\ninsular in its point of view. It did not understand, or seek\nto understand, America. It had excellent reasons for thoroughly\nunderstanding Sir Nigel Anstruthers. Its opinions of him it reserved\nto itself. If Messrs. Townlinson & Sheppard had been asked to give a\ndaughter into their client's keeping, they would have flatly refused to\naccept the honour proposed. Mr. Townlinson had, indeed, at the time of\nthe marriage, admitted in strict confidence to his partner that for his\npart he would have somewhat preferred to follow a daughter of his own to\nher tomb. After the marriage the firm had found the situation confusing\nand un-English. There had been trouble with Sir Nigel, who had plainly\nbeen disappointed. At first it had appeared that the American magnate\nhad shown astuteness in refraining from leaving his son-in-law a free\nhand. Lady Anstruthers' fortune was her own and not her husband's. Mr.\nTownlinson, paying a visit to Stornham and finding the bride a gentle,\nchildish-looking girl, whose most marked expression was one of growing\ntimorousness, had returned with a grave face. He foresaw the result, if\nher family did not stand by her with firmness, which he also foresaw her\nhusband would prevent if possible. It became apparent that the family\ndid not stand by her--or were cleverly kept at a distance. There was\na long illness, which seemed to end in the seclusion from the world,\nbrought about by broken health. Then it was certain that what Mr.\nTownlinson had foreseen had occurred. The inexperienced girl had been\nbullied into submission. Sir Nigel had gained the free hand, whatever\nthe means he had chosen to employ. Most improper--most improper, the\nwhole affair. He had a great deal of money, but none of it was used for\nthe benefit of the estate--his deformed boy's estate. Advice, dignified\nremonstrance, resulted only in most disagreeable scenes. Messrs.\nTownlinson & Sheppard could not exceed certain limits. The manner\nin which the money was spent was discreditable. There were avenues\na respectable firm knew only by rumour, there were insane gambling\nspeculations, which could only end in disaster, there were things one\ncould not decently concern one's self with. Lady Anstruthers' family\nhad doubtless become indignant and disgusted, and had dropped the whole\naffair. Sad for the poor woman, but not unnatural.\n\nAnd now appears a Miss Vanderpoel, who wishes to appoint an interview\nwith Messrs. Townlinson & Sheppard. What does she wish to say? The\nfamily is apparently taking the matter up. Is this lady an elder or a\nyounger sister of Lady Anstruthers? Is she an older woman of that strong\nand rather trying American type one hears of, or is she younger than her\nladyship, a pretty, indignant, totally unpractical girl, outraged by\nthe state of affairs she has discovered, foolishly coming to demand\nof Messrs. Townlinson & Sheppard an explanation of things they are not\nresponsible for? Will she, perhaps, lose her temper, and accuse and\nreproach, or even--most unpleasant to contemplate--shed hysterical\ntears?\n\nIt fell to Mr. Townlinson to receive her in the absence of Mr. Sheppard,\nwho had been called to Northamptonshire to attend to great affairs. He\nwas a stout, grave man with a heavy, well-cut face, and, when Bettina\nentered his room, his courteous reception of her reserved his view of\nthe situation entirely.\n\nShe was not of the mature and rather alarming American type he had\nimagined possible, he felt some relief in marking at once. She was also\nnot the pretty, fashionable young lady who might have come to scold him,\nand ask silly, irrational questions.\n\nHis ordinarily rather unillumined countenance changed somewhat in\nexpression when she sat down and began to speak. Mr. Townlinson was\nimpressed by the fact that it was at once unmistakably evident that\nwhatsoever her reason for coming, she had not presented herself to ask\nirrelevant or unreasonable questions. Lady Anstruthers, she explained\nwithout superfluous phrase, had no definite knowledge of her husband's\nwhereabouts, and it had seemed possible that Messrs. Townlinson &\nSheppard might have received some information more recent that her own.\nThe impersonal framing of this inquiry struck Mr. Townlinson as being in\nremarkably good taste, since it conveyed no condemnation of Sir Nigel,\nand no desire to involve Mr. Townlinson in expressing any. It refrained\neven from implying that the situation was an unusual one, which might\nbe open to criticism. Excellent reserve and great cleverness, Mr.\nTownlinson commented inwardly. There were certainly few young ladies who\nwould have clearly realised that a solicitor cannot be called upon to\ncommit himself, until he has had time to weigh matters and decide upon\nthem. His long and varied experience had included interviews in which\ncharming, emotional women had expected him at once to \"take sides.\" Miss\nVanderpoel exhibited no signs of expecting anything of this kind, even\nwhen she went on with what she had come to say. Stornham Court and\nits surroundings were depreciating seriously in value through need of\nradical repairs etc. Her sister's comfort was naturally involved, and,\nas Mr. Townlinson would fully understand, her nephew's future. The\nsooner the process of dilapidation was arrested, the better and with\nthe less difficulty. The present time was without doubt better than an\nindefinite future. Miss Vanderpoel, having fortunately been able to come\nto Stornham, was greatly interested, and naturally desirous of seeing\nthe work begun. Her father also would be interested. Since it was not\npossible to consult Sir Nigel, it had seemed proper to consult his\nsolicitors in whose hands the estate had been for so long a time. She\nwas aware, it seemed, that not only Mr. Townlinson, but Mr. Townlinson's\nfather, and also his grandfather, had legally represented the\nAnstruthers, as well as many other families. As there seemed no\nnecessity for any structural changes, and the work done was such as\ncould only rescue and increase the value of the estate, could there be\nany objection to its being begun without delay?\n\nCertainly an unusual young lady. It would be interesting to discover\nhow well she knew Sir Nigel, since it seemed that only a knowledge of\nhim--his temper, his bitter, irritable vanity, could have revealed\nto her the necessity of the precaution she was taking without even\nintimating that it was a precaution. Extraordinarily clever girl.\n\nMr. Townlinson wore an air of quiet, business-like reflection.\n\n\"You are aware, Miss Vanderpoel, that the present income from the\nestate is not such as would justify anything approaching the required\nexpenditure?\"\n\n\"Yes, I am aware of that. The expense would be provided for by my\nfather.\"\n\n\"Most generous on Mr. Vanderpoel's part,\" Mr. Townlinson commented. \"The\nestate would, of course, increase greatly in value.\"\n\nCircumstances had prevented her father from visiting Stornham, Miss\nVanderpoel explained, and this had led to his being ignorant of a\ncondition of things which he might have remedied. She did not explain\nwhat the particular circumstances which had separated the families had\nbeen, but Mr. Townlinson thought he understood. The condition existing\ncould be remedied now, if Messrs. Townlinson & Sheppard saw no obstacles\nother than scarcity of money.\n\nMr. Townlinson's summing up of the matter expressed in effect that he\nsaw none. The estate had been a fine one in its day. During the last\nsixty years it had become much impoverished. With conservative decorum\nof manner, he admitted that there had not been, since Sir Nigel's\nmarriage, sufficient reason for the neglect of dilapidations. The firm\nhad strongly represented to Sir Nigel that certain resources should not\nbe diverted from the proper object of restoring the property, which\nwas entailed upon his son. The son's future should beyond all have been\nconsidered in the dispensing of his mother's fortune.\n\nHe, by this time, comprehended fully that he need restrain no dignified\nexpression of opinion in his speech with this young lady. She had\ncome to consult with him with as clear a view of the proprieties and\ndiscretions demanded by his position as he had himself. And yet each,\nbefore the close of the interview, understood the point of view of the\nother. What he recognised was that, though she had not seen Sir Nigel\nsince her childhood, she had in some astonishing way obtained an\nextraordinary insight into his character, and it was this which had led\nher to take her present step. She might not realise all she might have\nto contend with, but her conservative and formal action had surrounded\nher and her sister with a certain barrier of conventional protection, at\nonce self-controlled, dignified, and astutely intelligent.\n\n\"Since, as you say, no structural changes are proposed, such as an owner\nmight resent, and as Lady Anstruthers is the mother of the heir, and as\nLady Anstruthers' father undertakes to defray all expenditure, no sane\nman could object to the restoration of the property. To do so would be\nto cause public opinion to express itself strongly against him. Such\naction would place him grossly in the wrong.\" Then he added with\ndeliberation, realising that he was committing himself, and feeling\nfirmly willing to do so for reasons of his own, \"Sir Nigel is a man who\nobjects strongly to putting himself--publicly--in the wrong.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Miss Vanderpoel.\n\nHe had said this of intention for her enlightenment, and she was aware\nthat he had done so.\n\n\"This will not be the first time that American fortunes have restored\nEnglish estates,\" Mr. Townlinson continued amiably. \"There have been\nmany notable cases of late years. We shall be happy to place ourselves\nat your disposal at all times, Miss Vanderpoel. We are obliged to you\nfor your consideration in the matter.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Miss Vanderpoel again. \"I wished to be sure that I\nshould not be infringing any English rule I had no knowledge of.\"\n\n\"You will be infringing none. You have been most correct and courteous.\"\n\nBefore she went away Mr. Townlinson felt that he had been greatly\nenlightened as to what a young lady might know and be. She gave him\nsingularly clear details as to what was proposed. There was so much to\nbe done that he found himself opening his eyes slightly once or twice.\nBut, of course, if Mr. Vanderpoel was prepared to spend money in\na lavish manner, it was all to the good so far as the estate was\nconcerned. They were stupendous, these people, and after all the heir\nwas his grandson. And how striking it was that with all this power and\nreadiness to use it, was evidently combined, even in this beautiful\nyoung person, the clearest business sense of the situation. What was\ndone would be for the comfort of Lady Anstruthers and the future of her\nson. Sir Nigel, being unable to sell either house or lands, could not\nundo it.\n\nWhen Mr. Townlinson accompanied his visitor to her carriage with\ndignified politeness he felt somewhat like an elderly solicitor who had\nfound himself drawn into the atmosphere of a sort of intensely modern\nfairy tale. He saw two of his under clerks, with the impropriety of\nmiddle-class youth, looking out of an office window at the dark blue\nbrougham and the tall young lady, whose beauty bloomed in the sunshine.\nHe did not, on the whole, wonder at, though he deplored, the conduct\nof the young men. But they, of course, saw only what they colloquially\ndescribed to each other as a \"rippin' handsome girl.\" They knew nothing\nof the interesting interview.\n\nHe himself returned to his private room in a musing mood and thought\nit all over, his mind dwelling on various features of the international\nsituation, and more than once he said aloud:\n\n\"Most remarkable. Very remarkable, indeed.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nTHE FIFTEENTH EARL OF MOUNT DUNSTAN\n\nJames Hubert John Fergus Saltyre--fifteenth Earl of Mount Dunstan, \"Jem\nSalter,\" as his neighbours on the Western ranches had called him, the\nred-haired, second-class passenger of the Meridiana, sat in the great\nlibrary of his desolate great house, and stared fixedly through the open\nwindow at the lovely land spread out before him. From this particular\nwindow was to be seen one of the greatest views in England. From the\nupper nurseries he had lived in as a child he had seen it every day from\nmorning until night, and it had seemed to his young fancy to cover all\nthe plains of the earth. Surely the rest of the world, he had thought,\ncould be but small--though somewhere he knew there was London where the\nQueen lived, and in London were Buckingham Palace and St. James Palace\nand Kensington and the Tower, where heads had been chopped off; and the\nHorse Guards, where splendid, plumed soldiers rode forth glittering,\nwith thrilling trumpets sounding as they moved. These last he always\nremembered, because he had seen them, and once when he had walked in\nthe park with his nurse there had been an excited stir in the Row,\nand people had crowded about a certain gate, through which an escorted\ncarriage had been driven, and he had been made at once to take off his\nhat and stand bareheaded until it passed, because it was the Queen.\nSomehow from that afternoon he dated the first presentation of certain\nvaguely miserable ideas. Inquiries made of his attendant, when the\ncortege had swept by, had elicited the fact that the Royal Lady herself\nhad children--little boys who were princes and little girls who were\nprincesses. What curious and persistent child cross-examination on his\npart had drawn forth the fact that almost all the people who drove about\nand looked so happy and brilliant, were the fathers or mothers of little\nboys like, yet--in some mysterious way--unlike himself? And in what\nmanner had he gathered that he was different from them? His nurse, it\nis true, was not a pleasant person, and had an injured and resentful\nbearing. In later years he realised that it had been the bearing of an\nirregularly paid menial, who rebelled against the fact that her place\nwas not among people who were of distinction and high repute, and whose\nhouseholds bestowed a certain social status upon their servitors. She\nwas a tall woman with a sour face and a bearing which conveyed a glum\nendurance of a position beneath her. Yes, it had been from her--Brough\nher name was--that he had mysteriously gathered that he was not a\ndesirable charge, as regarded from the point of the servants' hall--or,\nin fact, from any other point. His people were not the people whose\npatronage was sought with anxious eagerness. For some reason their town\nhouse was objectionable, and Mount Dunstan was without attractions.\nOther big houses were, in some marked way, different. The town house he\nobjected to himself as being gloomy and ugly, and possessing only a bare\nand battered nursery, from whose windows one could not even obtain a\nsatisfactory view of the Mews, where at least, there were horses and\ngrooms who hissed cheerfully while they curried and brushed them. He\nhated the town house and was, in fact, very glad that he was scarcely\never taken to it. People, it seemed, did not care to come either to\nthe town house or to Mount Dunstan. That was why he did not know other\nlittle boys. Again--for the mysterious reason--people did not care that\ntheir children should associate with him. How did he discover this?\nHe never knew exactly. He realised, however, that without distinct\nstatements, he seemed to have gathered it through various disconnected\ntalks with Brough. She had not remained with him long, having \"bettered\nherself\" greatly and gone away in glum satisfaction, but she had stayed\nlong enough to convey to him things which became part of his existence,\nand smouldered in his little soul until they became part of himself. The\nancestors who had hewn their way through their enemies with battle-axes,\nwho had been fierce and cruel and unconquerable in their savage pride,\nhad handed down to him a burning and unsubmissive soul. At six years\nold, walking with Brough in Kensington Gardens, and seeing other\nchildren playing under the care of nurses, who, he learned, were not\ninclined to make advances to his attendant, he dragged Brough away with\na fierce little hand and stood apart with her, scowling haughtily, his\nhead in the air, pretending that he disdained all childish gambols, and\nwould have declined to join in them, even if he had been besought to so\nfar unbend. Bitterness had been planted in him then, though he had\nnot understood, and the sourness of Brough had been connected with no\nintelligence which might have caused her to suspect his feelings, and no\none had noticed, and if anyone had noticed, no one would have cared in\nthe very least.\n\nWhen Brough had gone away to her far superior place, and she had been\nsucceeded by one variety of objectionable or incompetent person after\nanother, he had still continued to learn. In different ways he silently\ncollected information, and all of it was unpleasant, and, as he grew\nolder, it took for some years one form. Lack of resources, which should\nof right belong to persons of rank, was the radical objection to his\npeople. At the town house there was no money, at Mount Dunstan there was\nno money. There had been so little money even in his grandfather's time\nthat his father had inherited comparative beggary. The fourteenth Earl\nof Mount Dunstan did not call it \"comparative\" beggary, he called\nit beggary pure and simple, and cursed his progenitors with engaging\nfrankness. He never referred to the fact that in his personable youth he\nhad married a wife whose fortune, if it had not been squandered, might\nhave restored his own. The fortune had been squandered in the course of\na few years of riotous living, the wife had died when her third son was\nborn, which event took place ten years after the birth of her second,\nwhom she had lost through scarlet fever. James Hubert John Fergus\nSaltyre never heard much of her, and barely knew of her past existence\nbecause in the picture gallery he had seen a portrait of a tall, thin,\nfretful-looking young lady, with light ringlets, and pearls round\nher neck. She had not attracted him as a child, and the fact that he\ngathered that she had been his mother left him entirely unmoved. She\nwas not a loveable-looking person, and, indeed, had been at once\nempty-headed, irritable, and worldly. He would probably have been no\nless lonely if she had lived. Lonely he was. His father was engaged in\na career much too lively and interesting to himself to admit of his\nallowing himself to be bored by an unwanted and entirely superfluous\nchild. The elder son, who was Lord Tenham, had reached a premature\nand degenerate maturity by the time the younger one made his belated\nappearance, and regarded him with unconcealed dislike. The worst thing\nwhich could have befallen the younger boy would have been intimate\nassociation with this degenerate youth.\n\nAs Saltyre left nursery days behind, he learned by degrees that the\nobjection to himself and his people, which had at first endeavoured\nto explain itself as being the result of an unseemly lack of money,\ncombined with that unpleasant feature, an uglier one--namely, lack of\ndecent reputation. Angry duns, beggarliness of income, scarcity of\nthe necessaries and luxuries which dignity of rank demanded, the\nindifference and slights of one's equals, and the ignoring of one's\nexistence by exalted persons, were all hideous enough to Lord Mount\nDunstan and his elder son--but they were not so hideous as was, to his\nyounger son, the childish, shamed frenzy of awakening to the truth\nthat he was one of a bad lot--a disgraceful lot, from whom nothing was\nexpected but shifty ways, low vices, and scandals, which in the end\ncould not even be kept out of the newspapers. The day came, in fact,\nwhen the worst of these was seized upon by them and filled their sheets\nwith matter which for a whole season decent London avoided reading, and\nthe fast and indecent element laughed, derided, or gloated over.\n\nThe memory of the fever of the monstrous weeks which had passed at this\ntime was not one it was wise for a man to recall. But it was not to be\nforgotten--the hasty midnight arrival at Mount Dunstan of father and\nson, their haggard, nervous faces, their terrified discussions, and\nargumentative raging when they were shut up together behind locked\ndoors, the appearance of legal advisers who looked as anxious as\nthemselves, but failed to conceal the disgust with which they were\nbattling, the knowledge that tongues were clacking almost hysterically\nin the village, and that curious faces hurried to the windows when even\na menial from the great house passed, the atmosphere of below-stairs\nwhispers, and jogged elbows, and winks, and giggles; the final\ndesperate, excited preparations for flight, which might be ignominiously\nstopped at any moment by the intervention of the law, the huddling away\nat night time, the hot-throated fear that the shameful, self-branding\nmove might be too late--the burning humiliation of knowing the\ninevitable result of public contempt or laughter when the world next day\nheard that the fugitives had put the English Channel between themselves\nand their country's laws.\n\nLord Tenham had died a few years later at Port Said, after descending\ninto all the hells of degenerate debauch. His father had lived\nlonger--long enough to make of himself something horribly near an\nimbecile, before he died suddenly in Paris. The Mount Dunstan who\nsucceeded him, having spent his childhood and boyhood under the shadow\nof the \"bad lot,\" had the character of being a big, surly, unattractive\nyoung fellow, whose eccentricity presented itself to those who knew\nhis stock, as being of a kind which might develop at any time into any\nobjectionable tendency. His bearing was not such as allured, and his\nfortune was not of the order which placed a man in the view of the\nworld. He had no money to expend, no hospitalities to offer and\napparently no disposition to connect himself with society. His\nwild-goose chase to America had, when it had been considered worth while\ndiscussing at all, been regarded as being very much the kind of thing a\nMount Dunstan might do with some secret and disreputable end in view.\nNo one had heard the exact truth, and no one would have been inclined to\nbelieve if they had heard it. That he had lived as plain Jem Salter, and\nlaboured as any hind might have done, in desperate effort and mad hope,\nwould not have been regarded as a fact to be credited. He had gone away,\nhe had squandered money, he had returned, he was at Mount Dunstan again,\nliving the life of an objectionable recluse--objectionable, because the\nowner of a place like Mount Dunstan should be a power and an influence\nin the county, should be counted upon as a dispenser of hospitalities,\nas a supporter of charities, as a dignitary of weight. He was none of\nthese--living no one knew how, slouching about with his gun, riding or\nwalking sullenly over the roads and marshland.\n\nJust one man knew him intimately, and this one had been from his\nfifteenth year the sole friend of his life. He had come, then--the\nReverend Lewis Penzance--a poor and unhealthy scholar, to be vicar of\nthe parish of Dunstan. Only a poor and book-absorbed man would have\naccepted the position. What this man wanted was no more than quiet, pure\ncountry air to fill frail lungs, a roof over his head, and a place to\npore over books and manuscripts. He was a born monk and celibate--in\nby-gone centuries he would have lived peacefully in some monastery,\nspending his years in the reading and writing of black letter and the\nilluminating of missals. At the vicarage he could lead an existence\nwhich was almost the same thing.\n\nAt Mount Dunstan there remained still the large remnant of a great\nlibrary. A huge room whose neglected and half emptied shelves contained\nsome strange things and wonderful ones, though all were in disorder, and\ngiven up to dust and natural dilapidation. Inevitably the Reverend Lewis\nPenzance had found his way there, inevitably he had gained indifferently\nbestowed permission to entertain himself by endeavouring to reduce to\norder and to make an attempt at cataloguing. Inevitably, also, the hours\nhe spent in the place became the chief sustenance of his being.\n\nThere, one day, he had come upon an uncouth-looking boy with deep eyes\nand a shaggy crop of red hair. The boy was poring over an old volume,\nand was plainly not disposed to leave it. He rose, not too graciously,\nand replied to the elder man's greeting, and the friendly questions\nwhich followed. Yes, he was the youngest son of the house. He had\nnothing to do, and he liked the library. He often came there and sat and\nread things. There were some queer old books and a lot of stupid ones.\nThe book he was reading now? Oh, that (with a slight reddening of his\nskin and a little awkwardness at the admission) was one of those he\nliked best. It was one of the queer ones, but interesting for all that.\nIt was about their own people--the generations of Mount Dunstans who had\nlived in the centuries past. He supposed he liked it because there were\na lot of odd stories and exciting things in it. Plenty of fighting and\nadventure. There had been some splendid fellows among them. (He was\nbeginning to forget himself a little by this time.) They were afraid of\nnothing. They were rather like savages in the earliest days, but at that\ntime all the rest of the world was savage. But they were brave, and\nit was odd how decent they were very often. What he meant was--what\nhe liked was, that they were men--even when they were barbarians. You\ncouldn't be ashamed of them. Things they did then could not be done now,\nbecause the world was different, but if--well, the kind of men they were\nmight do England a lot of good if they were alive to-day. They would be\ndifferent themselves, of course, in one way--but they must be the same\nmen in others. Perhaps Mr. Penzance (reddening again) understood what he\nmeant. He knew himself very well, because he had thought it all out, he\nwas always thinking about it, but he was no good at explaining.\n\nMr. Penzance was interested. His outlook on the past and the present had\nalways been that of a bookworm, but he understood enough to see that\nhe had come upon a temperament novel enough to awaken curiosity. The\napparently entirely neglected boy, of a type singularly unlike that of\nhis father and elder brother, living his life virtually alone in the big\nplace, and finding food to his taste in stories of those of his blood\nwhose dust had mingled with the earth centuries ago, provided him with a\nnew subject for reflection.\n\nThat had been the beginning of an unusual friendship. Gradually Penzance\nhad reached a clear understanding of all the building of the young life,\nof its rankling humiliation, and the qualities of mind and body which\nmade for rebellion. It sometimes thrilled him to see in the big frame\nand powerful muscles, in the strong nature and unconquerable spirit,\na revival of what had burned and stirred through lives lived in a dim,\nalmost mythical, past. There were legends of men with big bodies, fierce\nfaces, and red hair, who had done big deeds, and conquered in dark and\nbarbarous days, even Fate's self, as it had seemed. None could overthrow\nthem, none could stand before their determination to attain that which\nthey chose to claim. Students of heredity knew that there were curious\ninstances of revival of type. There had been a certain Red Godwyn who\nhad ruled his piece of England before the Conqueror came, and who had\ndefied the interloper with such splendid arrogance and superhuman lack\nof fear that he had won in the end, strangely enough, the admiration\nand friendship of the royal savage himself, who saw, in his, a kindred\nsavagery, a power to be well ranged, through love, if not through fear,\nupon his own side. This Godwyn had a deep attraction for his descendant,\nwho knew the whole story of his fierce life--as told in one yellow\nmanuscript and another--by heart. Why might not one fancy--Penzance was\ndrawn by the imagining--this strong thing reborn, even as the offspring\nof a poorer effete type. Red Godwyn springing into being again, had been\nstronger than all else, and had swept weakness before him as he had done\nin other and far-off days.\n\nIn the old library it fell out in time that Penzance and the boy spent\nthe greater part of their days. The man was a bookworm and a scholar,\nyoung Saltyre had a passion for knowledge. Among the old books and\nmanuscripts he gained a singular education. Without a guide he could not\nhave gathered and assimilated all he did gather and assimilate. Together\nthe two rummaged forgotten shelves and chests, and found forgotten\nthings. That which had drawn the boy from the first always drew and\nabsorbed him--the annals of his own people. Many a long winter evening\nthe pair turned over the pages of volumes and of parchment, and followed\nwith eager interest and curiosity the records of wild lives--stories of\nwarriors and abbots and bards, of feudal lords at ruthless war with\neach other, of besiegings and battles and captives and torments. Legends\nthere were of small kingdoms torn asunder, of the slaughter of their\nkings, the mad fightings of their barons, and the faith or unfaith of\ntheir serfs. Here and there the eternal power revealed itself in some\nstory of lawful or unlawful love--for dame or damsel, royal lady,\nabbess, or high-born nun--ending in the welding of two lives or in\nrapine, violence, and death. There were annals of early England, and of\nmarauders, monks, and Danes. And, through all these, some thing, some\nman or woman, place, or strife linked by some tie with Mount Dunstan\nblood. In past generations, it seemed plain, there had been certain\nof the line who had had pride in these records, and had sought and\ncollected them; then had been born others who had not cared. Sometimes\nthe relations were inadequate, sometimes they wore an unauthentic air,\nbut most of them seemed, even after the passing of centuries, human\ndocuments, and together built a marvellous great drama of life and\npower, wickedness and passion and daring deeds.\n\nWhen the shameful scandal burst forth young Saltyre was seen by neither\nhis father nor his brother. Neither of them had any desire to see him;\nin fact, each detested the idea of confronting by any chance his hot,\nintolerant eyes. \"The Brat,\" his father had called him in his childhood,\n\"The Lout,\" when he had grown big-limbed and clumsy. Both he and Tenham\nwere sick enough, without being called upon to contemplate \"The Lout,\"\nwhose opinion, in any case, they preferred not to hear.\n\nSaltyre, during the hideous days, shut himself up in the library. He did\nnot leave the house, even for exercise, until after the pair had fled.\nHis exercise he took in walking up and down from one end of the long\nroom to another. Devils were let loose in him. When Penzance came to\nhim, he saw their fury in his eyes, and heard it in the savagery of his\nlaugh.\n\nHe kicked an ancient volume out of his way as he strode to and fro.\n\n\"There has been plenty of the blood of the beast in us in bygone times,\"\nhe said, \"but it was not like this. Savagery in savage days had its\nexcuse. This is the beast sunk into the gibbering, degenerate ape.\"\n\nPenzance came and spent hours of each day with him. Part of his rage\nwas the rage of a man, but he was a boy still, and the boyishness of his\nbitterly hurt youth was a thing to move to pity. With young blood, and\nyoung pride, and young expectancy rising within him, he was at an hour\nwhen he should have felt himself standing upon the threshold of the\nworld, gazing out at the splendid joys and promises and powerful deeds\nof it--waiting only the fit moment to step forth and win his place.\n\n\"But we are done for,\" he shouted once. \"We are done for. And I am as\nmuch done for as they are. Decent people won't touch us. That is where\nthe last Mount Dunstan stands.\" And Penzance heard in his voice an\nabsolute break. He stopped and marched to the window at the end of the\nlong room, and stood in dead stillness, staring out at the down-sweeping\nlines of heavy rain.\n\nThe older man thought many things, as he looked at his big back and\nbody. He stood with his legs astride, and Penzance noted that his right\nhand was clenched on his hip, as a man's might be as he clenched\nthe hilt of his sword--his one mate who might avenge him even when,\nstanding at bay, he knew that the end had come, and he must fall.\nPrimeval Force--the thin-faced, narrow-chested, slightly bald clergyman\nof the Church of England was thinking--never loses its way, or fails to\nsweep a path before it. The sun rises and sets, the seasons come and go,\nPrimeval Force is of them, and as unchangeable. Much of it stood before\nhim embodied in this strongly sentient thing. In this way the Reverend\nLewis found his thoughts leading him, and he--being moved to the depths\nof a fine soul--felt them profoundly interesting, and even sustaining.\n\nHe sat in a high-backed chair, holding its arms with long thin hands,\nand looking for some time at James Hubert John Fergus Saltyre. He said,\nat last, in a sane level voice:\n\n\"Lord Tenham is not the last Mount Dunstan.\"\n\nAfter which the stillness remained unbroken again for some minutes.\nSaltyre did not move or make any response, and, when he left his place\nat the window, he took up a book, and they spoke of other things.\n\nWhen the fourteenth Earl died in Paris, and his younger son succeeded,\nthere came a time when the two companions sat together in the library\nagain. It was the evening of a long day spent in discouraging hard work.\nIn the morning they had ridden side by side over the estate, in the\nafternoon they had sat and pored over accounts, leases, maps, plans. By\nnightfall both were fagged and neither in sanguine mood.\n\nMount Dunstan had sat silent for some time. The pair often sat silent.\nThis pause was ended by the young man's rising and standing up,\nstretching his limbs.\n\n\"It was a queer thing you said to me in this room a few years ago,\" he\nsaid. \"It has just come back to me.\"\n\nSingularly enough--or perhaps naturally enough--it had also just arisen\nagain from the depths of Penzance's subconsciousness.\n\n\"Yes,\" he answered, \"I remember. To-night it suggests premonition. Your\nbrother was not the last Mount Dunstan.\"\n\n\"In one sense he never was Mount Dunstan at all,\" answered the other\nman. Then he suddenly threw out his arms in a gesture whose whole\nsignificance it would have been difficult to describe. There was a kind\nof passion in it. \"I am the last Mount Dunstan,\" he harshly laughed.\n\"Moi qui vous parle! The last.\"\n\nPenzance's eyes resting on him took upon themselves the far-seeing\nlook of a man who watches the world of life without living in it. He\npresently shook his head.\n\n\"No,\" he said. \"I don't see that. No--not the last. Believe me.\"\n\nAnd singularly, in truth, Mount Dunstan stood still and gazed at him\nwithout speaking. The eyes of each rested in the eyes of the other. And,\nas had happened before, they followed the subject no further. From that\nmoment it dropped.\n\nOnly Penzance had known of his reasons for going to America. Even the\nfamily solicitors, gravely holding interviews with him and restraining\nexpression of their absolute disapproval of such employment of his\ninadequate resources, knew no more than that this Mount Dunstan, instead\nof wasting his beggarly income at Cairo, or Monte Carlo, or in Paris as\nthe last one had done, prefers to waste it in newer places. The head\nof the firm, when he bids him good-morning and leaves him alone, merely\nshrugs his shoulders and returns to his letter writing with the corners\nof his elderly mouth hard set.\n\nPenzance saw him off--and met him upon his return. In the library they\nsat and talked it over, and, having done so, closed the book of the\nepisode.\n\n*****\n\nHe sat at the table, his eyes upon the wide-spread loveliness of the\nlandscape, but his thought elsewhere. It wandered over the years already\nlived through, wandering backwards even to the days when existence,\nopening before the child eyes, was a baffling and vaguely unhappy thing.\n\nWhen the door opened and Penzance was ushered in by a servant, his face\nwore the look his friend would have been rejoiced to see swept away to\nreturn no more.\n\nThen let us take our old accustomed seat and begin some casual talk,\nwhich will draw him out of the shadows, and make him forget such things\nas it is not good to remember. That is what we have done many times in\nthe past, and may find it well to do many a time again.\n\nHe begins with talk of the village and the country-side. Village stories\nare often quaint, and stories of the countryside are sometimes--not\nalways--interesting. Tom Benson's wife has presented him with triplets,\nand there is great excitement in the village, as to the steps to be\ntaken to secure the three guineas given by the Queen as a reward for\nthis feat. Old Benny Bates has announced his intention of taking a fifth\nwife at the age of ninety, and is indignant that it has been suggested\nthat the parochial authorities in charge of the \"Union,\" in which he\nmust inevitably shortly take refuge, may interfere with his rights as\na citizen. The Reverend Lewis has been to talk seriously with him, and\nfinds him at once irate and obdurate.\n\n\"Vicar,\" says old Benny, \"he can't refuse to marry no man. Law won't let\nhim.\" Such refusal, he intimates, might drive him to wild and riotous\nliving. Remembering his last view of old Benny tottering down the\nvillage street in his white smock, his nut-cracker face like a withered\nrosy apple, his gnarled hand grasping the knotted staff his bent\nbody leaned on, Mount Dunstan grinned a little. He did not smile when\nPenzance passed to the restoration of the ancient church at Mellowdene.\n\"Restoration\" usually meant the tearing away of ancient oaken,\nhigh-backed pews, and the instalment of smug new benches, suggesting\nsuburban Dissenting chapels, such as the feudal soul revolts at. Neither\ndid he smile at a reference to the gathering at Dunholm Castle, which\nwas twelve miles away. Dunholm was the possession of a man who stood for\nall that was first and highest in the land, dignity, learning, exalted\ncharacter, generosity, honour. He and the late Lord Mount Dunstan had\nbeen born in the same year, and had succeeded to their titles almost at\nthe same time. There had arrived a period when they had ceased to know\neach other. All that the one man intrinsically was, the other man was\nnot. All that the one estate, its castle, its village, its tenantry,\nrepresented, was the antipodes of that which the other stood for.\nThe one possession held its place a silent, and perhaps, unconscious\nreproach to the other. Among the guests, forming the large house party\nwhich London social news had already recorded in its columns, were great\nand honourable persons, and interesting ones, men and women who counted\nas factors in all good and dignified things accomplished. Even in the\npresent Mount Dunstan's childhood, people of their world had ceased to\ncross his father's threshold. As one or two of the most noticeable names\nwere mentioned, mentally he recalled this, and Penzance, quick to see\nthe thought in his eyes, changed the subject.\n\n\"At Stornham village an unexpected thing has happened,\" he said. \"One of\nthe relatives of Lady Anstruthers has suddenly appeared--a sister. You\nmay remember that the poor woman was said to be the daughter of some\nrich American, and it seemed unexplainable that none of her family ever\nappeared, and things were allowed to go from bad to worse. As it was\nunderstood that there was so much money people were mystified by the\ncondition of things.\"\n\n\"Anstruthers has had money to squander,\" said Mount Dunstan. \"Tenham and\nhe were intimates. The money he spends is no doubt his wife's. As her\nfamily deserted her she has no one to defend her.\"\n\n\"Certainly her family has seemed to neglect her for years. Perhaps\nthey were disappointed in his position. Many Americans are extremely\nambitious. These international marriages are often singular things.\nNow--apparently without having been expected--the sister appears.\nVanderpoel is the name--Miss Vanderpoel.\"\n\n\"I crossed the Atlantic with her in the Meridiana,\" said Mount Dunstan.\n\n\"Indeed! That is interesting. You did not, of course, know that she was\ncoming here.\"\n\n\"I knew nothing of her but that she was a saloon passenger with a suite\nof staterooms, and I was in the second cabin. Nothing? That is not quite\ntrue, perhaps. Stewards and passengers gossip, and one cannot close\none's ears. Of course one heard constant reiteration of the number of\nmillions her father possessed, and the number of cabins she managed to\noccupy. During the confusion and alarm of the collision, we spoke to\neach other.\"\n\nHe did not mention the other occasion on which he had seen her. There\nseemed, on the whole, no special reason why he should.\n\n\"Then you would recognise her, if you saw her. I heard to-day that she\nseems an unusual young woman, and has beauty.\"\n\n\"Her eyes and lashes are remarkable. She is tall. The Americans are\nsetting up a new type.\"\n\n\"Yes, they used to send over slender, fragile little women. Lady\nAnstruthers was the type. I confess to an interest in the sister.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"She has made a curious impression. She has begun to do things. Stornham\nvillage has lost its breath.\" He laughed a little. \"She has been going\nover the place and discussing repairs.\"\n\nMount Dunstan laughed also. He remembered what she had said. And she had\nactually begun.\n\n\"That is practical,\" he commented.\n\n\"It is really interesting. Why should a young woman turn her\nattention to repairs? If it had been her father--the omnipotent Mr.\nVanderpoel--who had appeared, one would not have wondered at such\npractical activity. But a young lady--with remarkable eyelashes!\"\n\nHis elbows were on the arm of his chair, and he had placed the tips\nof his fingers together, wearing an expression of such absorbed\ncontemplation that Mount Dunstan laughed again.\n\n\"You look quite dreamy over it,\" he said.\n\n\"It allures me. Unknown quantities in character always allure me.\nI should like to know her. A community like this is made up of the\nabsolutely known quantity--of types repeating themselves through\ncenturies. A new one is almost a startling thing. Gossip over teacups is\nnot usually entertaining to me, but I found myself listening to little\nMiss Laura Brunel this afternoon with rather marked attention. I confess\nto having gone so far as to make an inquiry or so. Sir Nigel Anstruthers\nis not often at Stornham. He is away now. It is plainly not he who is\ninterested in repairs.\"\n\n\"He is on the Riviera, in retreat, in a place he is fond of,\" Mount\nDunstan said drily. \"He took a companion with him. A new infatuation. He\nwill not return soon.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nSPRING IN BOND STREET\n\nThe visit to London was part of an evolution of both body and mind to\nRosalie Anstruthers. In one of the wonderful modern hotels a suite of\nrooms was engaged for them. The luxury which surrounded them was not of\nthe order Rosalie had vaguely connected with hotels. Hotel-keepers had\napparently learned many things during the years of her seclusion.\n\nVanderpoels, at least, could so establish themselves as not to greatly\nfeel the hotel atmosphere. Carefully chosen colours textures, and\nappointments formed the background of their days, the food they ate\nwas a thing produced by art, the servants who attended them were\ncompletely-trained mechanisms. To sit by a window and watch the\nkaleidoscopic human tide passing by on its way to its pleasure, to reach\nits work, to spend its money in unending shops, to show itself and its\nequipage in the park, was a wonderful thing to Lady Anstruthers. It all\nseemed to be a part of the life and quality of Betty, little Betty,\nwhom she had remembered only as a child, and who had come to her a tall,\nstrong young beauty, who had--it was resplendently clear--never known\na fear in her life, and whose mere personality had the effect of making\nfears seem unreal.\n\nShe was taken out in a luxurious little brougham to shops whose varied\nallurements were placed eagerly at her disposal. Respectful persons,\nobedient to her most faintly-expressed desire, displayed garments as\nwonderful as those the New York trunks had revealed. She was besought\nto consider the fitness of articles whose exquisiteness she was almost\nafraid to look at. Her thin little body was wonderfully fitted, managed,\nencouraged to make the most of its long-ignored outlines.\n\n\"Her ladyship's slenderness is a great advantage,\" said the wisely\ninciting ones. \"There is no such advantage as delicacy of line.\"\n\nSumming up the character of their customer with the saleswoman's\neye, they realised the discretion of turning to Miss Vanderpoel for\nencouragement, though she was the younger of the two, and bore no title.\nThey were aware of the existence of persons of rank who were not lavish\npatrons, but the name of Vanderpoel held most promising suggestions. To\nan English shopkeeper the American has, of late years, represented\nthe spender--the type which, whatsoever its rank and resources, has,\nmysteriously, always money to hand over counters in exchange for things\nit chances to desire to possess. Each year surges across the Atlantic a\nhorde of these fortunate persons, who, to the sober, commercial British\nmind, appear to be free to devote their existences to travel and\nexpenditure. This contingent appears shopping in the various shopping\nthoroughfares; it buys clothes, jewels, miscellaneous attractive things,\nmaking its purchases of articles useful or decorative with a freedom\nfrom anxiety in its enjoyment which does not mark the mood of the\nordinary shopper. In the everyday purchaser one is accustomed to take\nfor granted, as a factor in his expenditure, a certain deliberation and\nuncertainty; to the travelling American in Europe, shopping appears to\nbe part of the holiday which is being made the most of. Surely, all the\nneat, smart young persons who buy frocks and blouses, hats and coats,\nhosiery and chains, cannot be the possessors of large incomes; there\nmust be, even in America, a middle class of middle-class resources, yet\nthese young persons, male and female, and most frequently unaccompanied\nby older persons--seeing what they want, greet it with expressions of\npleasure, waste no time in appropriating and paying for it, and go away\nas in relief and triumph--not as in that sober joy which is clouded by\nafterthought. The sales people are sometimes even vaguely cheered by their\ngay lack of any doubt as to the wisdom of their getting what they admire,\nand rejoicing in it. If America always buys in this holiday mood, it\nmust be an enviable thing to be a shopkeeper in their New York or Boston\nor San Francisco. Who would not make a fortune among them? They want\nwhat they want, and not something which seems to them less desirable,\nbut they open their purses and--frequently with some amused uncertainty\nas to the differences between sovereigns and half-sovereigns, florins\nand half-crowns--they pay their bills with something almost like glee.\nThey are remarkably prompt about bills--which is an excellent thing, as\nthey are nearly always just going somewhere else, to France or Germany\nor Italy or Scotland or Siberia. Those of us who are shopkeepers, or\ntheir salesmen, do not dream that some of them have incomes no larger\nthan our own, that they work for their livings, that they are teachers\njournalists, small writers or illustrators of papers or magazines that\nthey are unimportant soldiers of fortune, but, with their queer American\ninsistence on exploration, and the ignoring of limitations, they have,\nsomehow, managed to make this exultant dash for a few daring weeks or\nmonths of freedom and new experience. If we knew this, we should\nregard them from our conservative standpoint of provident decorum as\nimprovident lunatics, being ourselves unable to calculate with their odd\ncourage and their cheerful belief in themselves. What we do know is that\nthey spend, and we are far from disdaining their patronage, though most\nof them have an odd little familiarity of address and are not stamped\nwith that distinction which causes us to realise the enormous difference\nbetween the patron and the tradesman, and makes us feel the worm\nwe remotely like to feel ourselves, though we would not for worlds\nacknowledge the fact. Mentally, and in our speech, both among our equals\nand our superiors, we condescend to and patronise them a little, though\nthat, of course, is the fine old insular attitude it would be un-British\nto discourage. But, if we are not in the least definite concerning the\nposition and resources of these spenders as a mass, we are quite sure of\na select number. There is mention of them in the newspapers, of the\ntown houses, the castles, moors, and salmon fishings they rent, of\ntheir yachts, their presentations actually at our own courts, of their\npresence at great balls, at Ascot and Goodwood, at the opera on gala\nnights. One staggers sometimes before the public summing-up of the\namount of their fortunes. These people who have neither blood nor rank,\nthese men who labour in their business offices, are richer than our\ngreat dukes, at the realising of whose wealth and possessions we have at\ntimes almost turned pale.\n\n\"Them!\" chaffed a costermonger over his barrow. \"Blimme, if some o' them\nblokes won't buy Buckin'am Pallis an' the 'ole R'yal Fambly some mornin'\nwhen they're out shoppin'.\"\n\nThe subservient attendants in more than one fashionable shop Betty and\nher sister visit, know that Miss Vanderpoel is of the circle, though her\nfather has not as yet bought or hired any great estate, and his daughter\nhas not been seen in London.\n\n\"Its queer we've never heard of her being presented,\" one shopgirl says\nto another. \"Just you look at her.\"\n\nShe evidently knows what her ladyship ought to buy--what can be trusted\nnot to overpower her faded fragility. The saleswomen, even if they had\nnot been devoured by alert curiosity, could not have avoided seeing that\nher ladyship did not seem to know what should be bought, and that Miss\nVanderpoel did, though she did not direct her sister's selection,\nbut merely seemed to suggest with delicate restraint. Her taste was\nwonderfully perceptive. The things bought were exquisite, but a little\ncolourless woman could wear them all with advantage to her restrictions\nof type.\n\nAs the brougham drove down Bond Street, Betty called Lady Anstruthers'\nattention to more than one passer-by.\n\n\"Look, Rosy,\" she said. \"There is Mrs. Treat Hilyar in the second\ncarriage to the right. You remember Josie Treat Hilyar married Lord\nVarick's son.\"\n\nIn the landau designated an elderly woman with wonderfully-dressed\nwhite hair sat smiling and bowing to friends who were walking. Lady\nAnstruthers, despite her eagerness, shrank back a little, hoping to\nescape being seen.\n\n\"Oh, it is the Lows she is speaking to--Tom and Alice--I did not know\nthey had sailed yet.\"\n\nThe tall, well-groomed young man, with the nice, ugly face, was showing\nwhite teeth in a gay smile of recognition, and his pretty wife was\nlightly waving a slim hand in a grey suede glove.\n\n\"How cheerful and nice-tempered they look,\" said Rosy. \"Tom was only\ntwenty when I saw him last. Whom did he marry?\"\n\n\"An English girl. Such a love. A Devonshire gentleman's daughter. In New\nYork his friends called her Devonshire Cream and Roses. She is one of\nthe pretty, flushy, pink ones.\"\n\n\"How nice Bond Street is on a spring morning like this,\" said Lady\nAnstruthers. \"You may laugh at me for saying it, Betty, but somehow it\nseems to me more spring-like than the country.\"\n\n\"How clever of you!\" laughed Betty. \"There is so much truth in it.\"\nThe people walking in the sunshine were all full of spring thoughts and\nplans. The colours they wore, the flowers in the women's hats and the\nmen's buttonholes belonged to the season. The cheerful crowds of people\nand carriages had a sort of rushing stir of movement which suggested\nfreshness. Later in the year everything looks more tired. Now things\nwere beginning and everyone was rather inclined to believe that this\nyear would be better than last. \"Look at the shop windows,\" said Betty,\n\"full of whites and pinks and yellows and blues--the colours of hyacinth\nand daffodil beds. It seems as if they insist that there never has been\na winter and never will be one. They insist that there never was and\nnever will be anything but spring.\"\n\n\"It's in the air.\" Lady Anstruthers' sigh was actually a happy one. \"It\nis just what I used to feel in April when we drove down Fifth Avenue.\"\n\nAmong the crowds of freshly-dressed passers-by, women with flowery hats\nand light frocks and parasols, men with touches of flower-colour on the\nlapels of their coats, and the holiday look in their faces, she noted so\nmany of a familiar type that she began to look for and try to pick them\nout with quite excited interest.\n\n\"I believe that woman is an American,\" she would say. \"That girl looks\nas if she were a New Yorker,\" again. \"That man's face looks as if it\nbelonged to Broadway. Oh, Betty! do you think I am right? I should say\nthose girls getting out of the hansom to go into Burnham & Staples' came\nfrom out West and are going to buy thousands of things. Don't they look\nlike it?\"\n\nShe began to lean forward and look on at things with an interest so\nunlike her Stornham listlessness that Betty's heart was moved.\n\nHer face looked alive, and little waves of colour rose under her skin.\nSeveral times she laughed the natural little laugh of her girlhood which\nit had seemed almost too much to expect to hear again. The first of\nthese laughs came when she counted her tenth American, a tall Westerner\nof the cartoon type, sauntering along with an expression of speculative\nenjoyment on his odd face, and evidently, though furtively, chewing\ntobacco.\n\n\"I absolutely love him, Betty,\" she cried. \"You couldn't mistake him for\nanything else.\"\n\n\"No,\" answered Betty, feeling that she loved him herself, \"not if you\nfound him embalmed in the Pyramids.\"\n\nThey pleased themselves immensely, trying to guess what he would buy\nand take home to his wife and girls in his Western town--though Western\ntowns were very grand and amazing in these days, Betty explained, and\nknew they could give points to New York. He would not buy the things\nhe would have bought fifteen years ago. Perhaps, in fact, his wife and\ndaughters had come with him to London and stayed at the Metropole or\nthe Savoy, and were at this moment being fitted by tailors and modistes\npatronised by Royalty.\n\n\"Rosy, look! Do you see who that is? Do you recognise her? It is\nMrs. Bellingham. She was little Mina Thalberg. She married Captain\nBellingham. He was quite poor, but very well born--a nephew of Lord\nDunholm's. He could not have married a poor girl--but they have been so\nhappy together that Mina is growing fat, and spends her days in taking\nreducing treatments. She says she wouldn't care in the least, but Dicky\nfell in love with her waist and shoulder line.\"\n\nThe plump, pretty young woman getting out of her victoria before a\nfashionable hairdresser's looked radiant enough. She had not yet lost\nthe waist and shoulder line, though her pink frock fitted her with\ndiscreet tightness. She paused a moment to pat and fuss prettily over\nthe two blooming, curly children who were to remain under the care of\nthe nurse, who sat on the back seat, holding the baby on her lap.\n\n\"I should not have known her,\" said Rosy. \"She has grown pretty. She\nwasn't a pretty child.\"\n\n\"It's happiness--and the English climate--and Captain Dicky. They adore\neach other, and laugh at everything like a pair of children. They were\nimmensely popular in New York last winter, when they visited Mina's\npeople.\"\n\nThe effect of the morning upon Lady Anstruthers was what Betty had hoped\nit might be. The curious drawing near of the two nations began to dawn\nupon her as a truth. Immured in the country, not sufficiently interested\nin life to read newspapers, she had heard rumours of some of the more\nimportant marriages, but had known nothing of the thousand small details\nwhich made for the weaving of the web. Mrs. Treat Hilyar driving in a\nleisurely, accustomed fashion down Bond Street, and smiling casually at\nher compatriots, whose \"sailing\" was as much part of the natural order\nof their luxurious lives as their carriages, gave a definiteness to the\nsituation. Mina Thalberg, pulling down the embroidered frocks over the\nround legs of her English-looking children, seemed to narrow the width\nof the Atlantic Ocean between Liverpool and the docks on the Hudson\nRiver.\n\nShe returned to the hotel with an appetite for lunch and a new\nexpression in her eyes which made Ughtred stare at her.\n\n\"Mother,\" he said, \"you look different. You look well. It isn't only\nyour new dress and your hair.\"\n\nThe new style of her attire had certainly done much, and the maid who\nhad been engaged to attend her was a woman who knew her duties. She had\nbeen called upon in her time to make the most of hair offering much\nless assistance to her skill than was supplied by the fine, fair\ncolourlessness she had found dragged back from her new mistress's\nforehead. It was not dragged back now, but had really been done wonders\nwith. Rosalie had smiled a little when she had looked at herself in the\nglass after the first time it was so dressed.\n\n\"You are trying to make me look as I did when mother saw me last,\nBetty,\" she said. \"I wonder if you possibly could.\"\n\n\"Let us believe we can,\" laughed Betty. \"And wait and see.\"\n\nIt seemed wise neither to make nor receive visits. The time for such\nthings had evidently not yet come. Even the mention of the Worthingtons\nled to the revelation that Rosalie shrank from immediate contact with\npeople. When she felt stronger, when she became more accustomed to the\nthought, she might feel differently, but just now, to be luxuriously one\nwith the enviable part of London, to look on, to drink in, to drive here\nand there, doing the things she liked to do, ordering what was required\nat Stornham, was like the creating for her of a new heaven and a new\nearth.\n\nWhen, one night, Betty took her with Ughtred to the theatre, it was to\nsee a play written by an American, played by American actors, produced\nby an American manager. They had even engaged in theatrical enterprise,\nit seemed, their actors played before London audiences, London actors\nplayed in American theatres, vibrating almost yearly between the two\ncontinents and reaping rich harvests. Hearing rumours of this in the\npast, Lady Anstruthers had scarcely believed it entirely true. Now the\npractical reality was brought before her. The French, who were only\nseparated from the English metropolis by a mere few miles of Channel,\ndid not exchange their actors year after year in increasing numbers,\nmaking a mere friendly barter of each other's territory, as though each\nland was common ground and not divided by leagues of ocean travel.\n\n\"It seems so wonderful,\" Lady Anstruthers argued. \"I have always felt as\nif they hated each other.\"\n\n\"They did once--but how could it last between those of the same\nblood--of the same tongue? If we were really aliens we might be a\nmenace. But we are of their own.\" Betty leaned forward on the edge of\nthe box, looking out over the crowded house, filled with almost as many\nAmericans as English faces. She smiled, reflecting. \"We were children\nput out to nurse and breathe new air in the country, and now we are\ncoming home, vigorous, and full-grown.\"\n\nShe studied the audience for some minutes, and, as her glance wandered\nover the stalls, it took in more than one marked variety of type.\nSuddenly it fell on a face she delightedly recognised. It was that of\nthe nice, speculative-eyed Westerner they had seen enjoying himself in\nBond Street.\n\n\"Rosy,\" she said, \"there is the Western man we love. Near the end of the\nfourth row.\"\n\nLady Anstruthers looked for him with eagerness.\n\n\"Oh, I see him! Next to the big one with the reddish hair.\"\n\nBetty turned her attention to the man in question, whom she had not\nchanced to notice. She uttered an exclamation of surprise and interest.\n\n\"The big man with the red hair. How lovely that they should chance to\nsit side by side--the big one is Lord Mount Dunstan!\"\n\nThe necessity of seeing his solicitors, who happened to be Messrs.\nTownlinson & Sheppard, had brought Lord Mount Dunstan to town. After a\nday devoted to business affairs, he had been attracted by the idea of\ngoing to the theatre to see again a play he had already seen in New\nYork. It would interest him to observe its exact effect upon a London\naudience. While he had been in New York, he had gone with something of\nthe same feeling to see a great English actor play to a crowded house.\nThe great actor had been one who had returned to the country for a third\nor fourth time, and, in the enthusiasm he had felt in the atmosphere\nabout him, Mount Dunstan had seen not only pleasure and appreciation of\nthe man's perfect art, but--at certain tumultuous outbursts--an almost\nemotional welcome. The Americans, he had said to himself, were creatures\nof warmer blood than the English. The audience on that occasion had\nbeen, in mass, American. The audience he made one of now, was made up of\nboth nationalities, and, in glancing over it, he realised how large was\nthe number of Americans who came yearly to London. As Lady Anstruthers\nhad done, he found himself selecting from the assemblage the types which\nwere manifestly American, and those obviously English. In the seat next\nto himself sat a man of a type he felt he had learned by heart in\nthe days of his life as Jem Salter. At a short distance fluttered\nbrilliantly an English professional beauty, with her male and female\ncourt about her. In the stage box, made sumptuous with flowers, was a\nroyal party.\n\nAs this party had entered, \"God save the Queen\" had been played, and, in\nrising with the audience during the entry, he had recalled that the tune\nwas identical with that of an American national air. How unconsciously\ninseparable--in spite of the lightness with which they regarded the\ncurious tie between them--the two countries were. The people upon the\nstage were acting as if they knew their public, their bearing\nsuggesting no sense of any barrier beyond the footlights. It was the\nunconsciousness and lightness of the mutual attitude which had struck\nhim of late. Punch had long jested about \"Fair Americans,\" who, in\ntheir first introduction to its pages, used exotic and cryptic language,\nbeginning every sentence either with \"I guess,\" or \"Say, Stranger\"; its\nmale American had been of the Uncle Sam order and had invariably worn\na \"goatee.\" American witticisms had represented the Englishman in\nplaid trousers, opening his remarks with \"Chawley, deah fellah,\" and\nunfailingly missing the point of any joke. Each country had cherished\nits type and good-naturedly derided it. In time this had modified itself\nand the joke had changed in kind. Many other things had changed, but the\nlightness of treatment still remained. And yet their blood was mingling\nitself with that of England's noblest and oldest of name, their wealth\nwas making solid again towers and halls which had threatened to crumble.\nAncient family jewels glittered on slender, young American necks, and\nabove--sometimes somewhat careless--young American brows. And yet, so\nfar, one was casual in one's thought of it all, still. On his own part\nhe was obstinate Briton enough to rebel against and resent it. They\nwere intruders. He resented them as he had resented in his boyhood the\nhistorical fact that, after all, an Englishman was a German--a savage\nwho, five hundred years after the birth of Christ, had swooped upon\nEarly Briton from his Engleland and Jutland, and ravaging with fire and\nsword, had conquered and made the land his possession, ravishing its\nvery name from it and giving it his own. These people did not come with\nfire and sword, but with cable and telephone, and bribes of gold and\nfair women, but they were encroaching like the sea, which, in certain\nparts of the coast, gained a few inches or so each year. He shook his\nshoulders impatiently, and stiffened, feeling illogically antagonistic\ntowards the good-natured, lantern-jawed man at his side.\n\nThe lantern-jawed man looked good-natured because he was smiling, and\nhe was smiling because he saw something which pleased him in one of the\nboxes.\n\nHis expression of unqualified approval naturally directed Mount\nDunstan's eye to the point in question, where it remained for some\nmoments. This was because he found it resting upon Miss Vanderpoel, who\nsat before him in luminous white garments, and with a brilliant spark\nof ornament in the dense shadow of her hair. His sensation at the\nunexpected sight of her would, if it had expressed itself physically,\nhave taken the form of a slight start. The luminous quality did not\nconfine itself to the whiteness of her garments. He was aware of feeling\nthat she looked luminous herself--her eyes, her cheek, the smile she\nbent upon the little woman who was her companion. She was a beautifully\nliving thing.\n\nNaturally, she was being looked at by others than himself. She was one\nof those towards whom glasses in a theatre turn themselves inevitably.\nThe sweep and lift of her black hair would have drawn them, even if she\nhad offered no other charm. Yes, he thought, here was another of them.\nTo whom was she bringing her good looks and her millions? There were men\nenough who needed money, even if they must accept it under less alluring\nconditions. In the box next to the one occupied by the royal party was a\nman who was known to be waiting for the advent of some such opportunity.\nHis was a case of dire, if outwardly stately, need. He was young, but a\nfool, and not noted for personal charms, yet he had, in one sense, great\nthings to offer. There were, of course, many chances that he might offer\nthem to her. If this happened, would she accept them? There was really\nno objection to him but his dulness, consequently there seemed many\nchances that she might. There was something akin to the pomp of royalty\nin the power her father's wealth implied. She could scarcely make an\nordinary marriage. It would naturally be a sort of state affair.\nThere were few men who had enough to offer in exchange for Vanderpoel\nmillions, and of the few none had special attractions. The one in\nthe box next to the royal party was a decent enough fellow. As young\nprincesses were not infrequently called upon, by the mere exclusion of\nroyal blood, to become united to young or mature princes without charm,\nso American young persons who were of royal possessions must find\nthemselves limited. If you felt free to pick and choose from among\nyoung men in the Guards or young attaches in the Diplomatic Service with\ntwopence a year, you might get beauty or wit or temperament or all three\nby good luck, but if you were of a royal house of New York or Chicago,\nyou would probably feel you must draw lines and choose only such\nsplendours as accorded with, even while differing from, your own.\n\nAny possible connection of himself with such a case did not present\nitself to him. If it had done so, he would have counted himself,\nhaughtily, as beyond the pale. It was for other men to do things of the\nsort; a remote antagonism of his whole being warred against the mere\nidea. It was bigoted prejudice, perhaps, but it was a strong thing.\n\nA lovely shoulder and a brilliant head set on a long and slender neck\nhave no nationality which can prevent a man's glance turning naturally\ntowards them. His turned again during the last act of the play, and at a\nmoment when he saw something rather like the thing he had seen when\nthe Meridiana moved away from the dock and the exalted Miss Vanderpoel\nleaning upon the rail had held out her arms towards the child who had\nbrought his toy to her as a farewell offering.\n\nSitting by her to-night was a boy with a crooked back--Mount Dunstan\nremembered hearing that the Anstruthers had a deformed son--and she\nwas leaning towards him, her hand resting on his shoulder, explaining\nsomething he had not quite grasped in the action of the play. The\nabsolute adoration in the boy's uplifted eyes was an interesting thing\nto take in, and the radiant warmth of her bright look was as unconscious\nof onlookers as it had been when he had seen it yearning towards the\nchild on the wharf. Hers was the temperament which gave--which gave. He\nfound himself restraining a smile because her look brought back to him\nthe actual sound of the New York youngster's voice.\n\n\"I wanted to kiss you, Betty, oh, I did so want to kiss you!\"\n\nAnstruthers' boy--poor little beggar--looked as if he, too, in the face\nof actors and audience, and brilliance of light, wanted to kiss her.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nTHINGS OCCUR IN STORNHAM VILLAGE\n\nIt would not have been possible for Miss Vanderpoel to remain long in\nsocial seclusion in London, and, before many days had passed, Stornham\nvillage was enlivened by the knowledge that her ladyship and her sister\nhad returned to the Court. It was also evident that their visit to\nLondon had not been made to no purpose. The stagnation of the waters of\nvillage life threatened to become a whirlpool. A respectable person, who\nwas to be her ladyship's maid, had come with them, and her ladyship had\nnot been served by a personal attendant for years. Her ladyship had also\nappeared at the dinner-table in new garments, and with her hair done\nas other ladies wore theirs. She looked like a different woman, and\nactually had a bit of colour, and was beginning to lose her frightened\nway. Now it dawned upon even the dullest and least active mind that\nsomething had begun to stir.\n\nIt had been felt vaguely when the new young lady from \"Meriker\" had\nwalked through the village street, and had drawn people to doors and\nwindows by her mere passing. After the return from London the signs of\nactivity were such as made the villagers catch their breaths in uttering\nuncertain exclamations, and caused the feminine element to catch up\noffspring or, dragging it by its hand, run into neighbours' cottages and\nstand talking the incredible thing over in lowered and rather breathless\nvoices. Yet the incredible thing in question was--had it been seen from\nthe standpoint of more prosperous villagers--anything but extraordinary.\nIn entirely rural places the Castle, the Hall or the Manor, the Great\nHouse--in short--still retains somewhat of the old feudal power to\nbestow benefits or withhold them. Wealth and good will at the Manor\nsupply work and resultant comfort in the village and its surrounding\nholdings. Patronised by the Great House the two or three small village\nshops bestir themselves and awaken to activity. The blacksmith swings\nhis hammer with renewed spirit over the numerous jobs the gentry's\nstables, carriage houses, garden tools, and household repairs give\nto him. The carpenter mends and makes, the vicarage feels at ease,\nrealising that its church and its charities do not stand unsupported.\nSmall farmers and larger ones, under a rich and interested landlord,\nthrive and are able to hold their own even against the tricks of wind\nand weather. Farm labourers being, as a result, certain of steady and\ndecent wage, trudge to and fro, with stolid cheerfulness, knowing that\nthe pot boils and the children's feet are shod. Superannuated old men\nand women are sure of their broth and Sunday dinner, and their dread of\nthe impending \"Union\" fades away. The squire or my lord or my lady can\nbe depended upon to care for their old bones until they are laid under\nthe sod in the green churchyard. With wealth and good will at the Great\nHouse, life warms and offers prospects. There are Christmas feasts and\ngifts and village treats, and the big carriage or the smaller ones stop\nat cottage doors and at once confer exciting distinction and carry good\ncheer.\n\nBut Stornham village had scarcely a remote memory of any period of such\nprosperity. It had not existed even in the older Sir Nigel's time, and\ncertainly the present Sir Nigel's reign had been marked only by neglect,\nill-temper, indifference, and a falling into disorder and decay. Farms\nwere poorly worked, labourers were unemployed, there was no trade from\nthe manor household, no carriages, no horses, no company, no spending\nof money. Cottages leaked, floors were damp, the church roof itself was\nfalling to pieces, and the vicar had nothing to give. The helpless and\nold cottagers were carried to the \"Union\" and, dying there, were buried\nby the stinted parish in parish coffins.\n\nHer ladyship had not visited the cottages since her child's birth. And\nnow such inspiriting events as were everyday happenings in lucky places\nlike Westerbridge and Wratcham and Yangford, showed signs of being about\nto occur in Stornham itself.\n\nTo begin with, even before the journey to London, Kedgers had made two\nor three visits to The Clock, and had been in a communicative mood. He\nhad related the story of the morning when he had looked up from his\nwork and had found the strange young lady standing before him, with the\nresult that he had been \"struck all of a heap.\" And then he had given a\ndetailed account of their walk round the place, and of the way in which\nshe had looked at things and asked questions, such as would have done\ncredit to a man \"with a 'ead on 'im.\"\n\n\"Nay! Nay!\" commented Kedgers, shaking his own head doubtfully, even\nwhile with admiration. \"I've never seen the like before--in young\nwomen--neither in lady young women nor in them that's otherwise.\"\n\nAfterwards had transpired the story of Mrs. Noakes, and the kitchen\ngrate, Mrs. Noakes having a friend in Miss Lupin, the village\ndressmaker.\n\n\"I'd not put it past her,\" was Mrs. Noakes' summing up, \"to order a new\none, I wouldn't.\"\n\nThe footman in the shabby livery had been a little wild in his\nstatements, being rendered so by the admiring and excited state of his\nmind. He dwelt upon the matter of her \"looks,\" and the way she lighted\nup the dingy dining-room, and so conversed that a man found himself\nlistening and glancing when it was his business to be an unhearing,\nunseeing piece of mechanism.\n\nSuch simple records of servitors' impressions were quite enough for\nStornham village, and produced in it a sense of being roused a little\nfrom sleep to listen to distant and uncomprehended, but not unagreeable,\nsounds.\n\nOne morning Buttle, the carpenter, looked up as Kedgers had done, and\nsaw standing on the threshold of his shop the tall young woman, who was\na sensation and an event in herself.\n\n\"You are the master of this shop?\" she asked.\n\nButtle came forward, touching his brow in hasty salute.\n\n\"Yes, my lady,\" he answered. \"Joseph Buttle, your ladyship.\"\n\n\"I am Miss Vanderpoel,\" dismissing the suddenly bestowed title with easy\ndirectness. \"Are you busy? I want to talk to you.\"\n\nNo one had any reason to be \"busy\" at any time in Stornham village, no\nsuch luck; but Buttle did not smile as he replied that he was at liberty\nand placed himself at his visitor's disposal. The tall young lady came\ninto the little shop, and took the chair respectfully offered to her.\nButtle saw her eyes sweep the place as if taking in its resources.\n\n\"I want to talk to you about some work which must be done at the Court,\"\nshe explained at once. \"I want to know how much can be done by workmen\nof the village. How many men have you?\"\n\n\"How many men had he?\" Buttle wavered between gratification at its being\nsupposed that he had \"men\" under him and grumpy depression because the\nillusion must be dispelled.\n\n\"There's me and Sim Soames, miss,\" he answered. \"No more, an' no less.\"\n\n\"Where can you get more?\" asked Miss Vanderpoel.\n\nIt could not be denied that Buttle received a mental shock which verged\nin its suddenness on being almost a physical one. The promptness and\ndecision of such a query swept him off his feet. That Sim Soames and\nhimself should be an insufficient force to combat with such repairs as\nthe Court could afford was an idea presenting an aspect of unheard-of\nnovelty, but that methods as coolly radical as those this questioning\nimplied, should be resorted to, was staggering.\n\n\"Me and Sim has always done what work was done,\" he stammered. \"It\nhasn't been much.\"\n\nMiss Vanderpoel neither assented to nor dissented from this last\npalpable truth. She regarded Buttle with searching eyes. She was\nwondering if any practical ability concealed itself behind his dullness.\nIf she gave him work, could he do it? If she gave the whole village\nwork, was it too far gone in its unspurred stodginess to be roused to\ncarrying it out?\n\n\"There is a great deal to be done now,\" she said. \"All that can be done\nin the village should be done here. It seems to me that the villagers\nwant work--new work. Do they?\"\n\nWork! New work! The spark of life in her steady eyes actually\nlighted a spark in the being of Joe Buttle. Young ladies in\nvillages--gentry--usually visited the cottagers a bit if they were\nwell-meaning young women--left good books and broth or jelly, pottered\nabout and were seen at church, and playing croquet, and finally married\nand removed to other places, or gradually faded year by year into\nrespectable spinsterhood. And this one comes in, and in two or three\nminutes shows that she knows things about the place and understands. A\nman might then take it for granted that she would understand the thing\nhe daringly gathered courage to say.\n\n\"They want any work, miss--that they are sure of decent pay for--sure of\nit.\"\n\nShe did understand. And she did not treat his implication as an\nimpertinence. She knew it was not intended as one, and, indeed, she saw\nin it a sort of earnest of a possible practical quality in Buttle.\nSuch work as the Court had demanded had remained unpaid for with quiet\npersistence, until even bills had begun to lag and fall off. She could\nsee exactly how it had been done, and comprehended quite clearly a lack\nof enthusiasm in the presence of orders from the Great House.\n\n\"All work will be paid for,\" she said. \"Each week the workmen will\nreceive their wages. They may be sure. I will be responsible.\"\n\n\"Thank you, miss,\" said Buttle, and he half unconsciously touched his\nforehead again.\n\n\"In a place like this,\" the young lady went on in her mellow voice, and\nwith a reflective thoughtfulness in her handsome eyes, \"on an estate\nlike Stornham, no work that can be done by the villagers should be done\nby anyone else. The people of the land should be trained to do such work\nas the manor house, or cottages, or farms require to have done.\"\n\n\"How did she think that out?\" was Buttle's reflection. In places such\nas Stornham, through generation after generation, the thing she had just\nsaid was accepted as law, clung to as a possession, any divergence from\nit being a grievance sullenly and bitterly grumbled over. And in places\nenough there was divergence in these days--the gentry sending to London\nfor things, and having up workmen to do their best-paying jobs for them.\nThe law had been so long a law that no village could see justice\nin outsiders being sent for, even to do work they could not do well\nthemselves. It showed what she was, this handsome young woman--even\nthough she did come from America--that she should know what was right.\n\nShe took a note-book out and opened it on the rough table before her.\n\n\"I have made some notes here,\" she said, \"and a sketch or two. We must\ntalk them over together.\"\n\nIf she had given Joe Buttle cause for surprise at the outset, she gave\nhim further cause during the next half-hour. The work that was to be\ndone was such as made him open his eyes, and draw in his breath. If\nhe was to be allowed to do it--if he could do it--if it was to be\npaid for--it struck him that he would be a man set up for life. If her\nladyship had come and ordered it to be done, he would have thought the\npoor thing had gone mad. But this one had it all jotted down in a clear\nhand, without the least feminine confusion of detail, and with here and\nthere a little sharply-drawn sketch, such as a carpenter, if he could\ndraw, which Buttle could not, might have made.\n\n\"There's not workmen enough in the village to do it in a year, miss,\" he\nsaid at last, with a gasp of disappointment.\n\nShe thought it over a minute, her pencil poised in her hand and her eyes\non his face.\n\n\"Can you,\" she said, \"undertake to get men from other villages, and\nsuperintend what they do? If you can do that, the work is still passing\nthrough your hands, and Stornham will reap the benefit of it. Your\nworkmen will lodge at the cottages and spend part of their wages at the\nshops, and you who are a Stornham workman will earn the money to be made\nout of a rather large contract.\"\n\nJoe Buttle became quite hot. If you have brought up a family for years\non the proceeds of such jobs as driving a ten-penny nail in here or\nthere, tinkering a hole in a cottage roof, knocking up a shelf in\nthe vicarage kitchen, and mending a panel of fence, to be suddenly\nconfronted with a proposal to engage workmen and undertake \"contracts\"\nis shortening to the breath and heating to the blood.\n\n\"Miss,\" he said, \"we've never done big jobs, Sim Soames an' me. P'raps\nwe're not up to it--but it'd be a fortune to us.\"\n\nShe was looking down at one of her papers and making pencil marks on it.\n\n\"You did some work last year on a little house at Tidhurst, didn't you?\"\nshe said.\n\nTo think of her knowing that! Yes, the unaccountable good luck had\nactually come to him that two Tidhurst carpenters, falling ill of the\nsame typhoid at the same time, through living side by side in the same\norder of unsanitary cottage, he and Sim had been given their work to\nfinish, and had done their best.\n\n\"Yes, miss,\" he answered.\n\n\"I heard that when I was inquiring about you. I drove over to Tidhurst\nto see the work, and it was very sound and well done. If you did that, I\ncan at least trust you to do something at the Court which will prove to\nme what you are equal to. I want a Stornham man to undertake this.\"\n\n\"No Tidhurst man,\" said Joe Buttle, with sudden courage, \"nor yet no\nBarnhurst, nor yet no Yangford, nor Wratcham shall do it, if I can look\nit in the face. It's Stornham work and Stornham had ought to have it. It\ngives me a brace-up to hear of it.\"\n\nThe tall young lady laughed beautifully and got up.\n\n\"Come to the Court to-morrow morning at ten, and we will look it over\ntogether,\" she said. \"Good-morning, Buttle.\" And she went away.\n\nIn the taproom of The Clock, when Joe Buttle dropped in for his pot of\nbeer, he found Fox, the saddler, and Tread, the blacksmith, and each of\nthem fell upon the others with something of the same story to tell. The\nnew young lady from the Court had been to see them, too, and had brought\nto each her definite little note-book. Harness was to be repaired and\nfurbished up, the big carriage and the old phaeton were to be put in\norder, and Master Ughtred's cart was to be given new paint and springs.\n\n\"This is what she said,\" Fox's story ran, \"and she said it so\nstraightforward and business-like that the conceitedest man that lived\ncouldn't be upset by it. 'I want to see what you can do,' she says. 'I\nam new to the place and I must find out what everyone can do, then I\nshall know what to do myself.' The way she sets them eyes on a man is a\nsight. It's the sense in them and the human nature that takes you.\"\n\n\"Yes, it's the sense,\" said Tread, \"and her looking at you as if she\nexpected you to have sense yourself, and understand that she's doing\nfair business. It's clear-headed like--her asking questions and finding\nout what Stornham men can do. She's having the old things done up so\nthat she can find out, and so that she can prove that the Court work is\ngoing to be paid for. That's my belief.\"\n\n\"But what does it all mean?\" said Joe Buttle, setting his pot of beer\ndown on the taproom table, round which they sat in conclave. \"Where's\nthe money coming from? There's money somewhere.\"\n\nTread was the advanced thinker of the village. He had come--through\nreverses--from a bigger place. He read the newspapers.\n\n\"It'll come from where it's got a way of coming,\" he gave forth\nportentously. \"It'll come from America. How they manage to get hold\nof so much of it there is past me. But they've got it, dang 'em, and\nthey're ready to spend it for what they want, though they're a sharp\nlot. Twelve years ago there was a good bit of talk about her ladyship's\nfather being one of them with the fullest pockets. She came here with\nplenty, but Sir Nigel got hold of it for his games, and they're the\ngames that cost money. Her ladyship wasn't born with a backbone, poor\nthing, but this new one was, and her ladyship's father is her father,\nand you mark my words, there's money coming into Stornham, though it's\nnot going to be played the fool with. Lord, yes! this new one has a\nbackbone and good strong wrists and a good strong head, though I\nmust say\"--with a little masculine chuckle of admission--\"it's a bit\nunnatural with them eyelashes and them eyes looking at you between 'em.\nLike blue water between rushes in the marsh.\"\n\nBefore the next twenty-four hours had passed a still more unlooked-for\nevent had taken place. Long outstanding bills had been paid, and in as\nmatter-of-fact manner as if they had not been sent in and ignored, in\nsome cases for years. The settlement of Joe Buttle's account sent him\nto bed at the day's end almost light-headed. To become suddenly the\npossessor of thirty-seven pounds, fifteen and tenpence half-penny, of\nwhich all hope had been lost three years ago, was almost too much for\nany man. Six pounds, eight pounds, ten pounds, came into places as if\nsovereigns had been sixpences, and shillings farthings. More than\none cottage woman, at the sight of the hoarded wealth in her staring\ngoodman's hand, gulped and began to cry. If they had had it before, and\nin driblets, it would have been spent long since, now, in a lump, it\nmeant shoes and petticoats and tea and sugar in temporary abundance,\nand the sense of this abundance was felt to be entirely due to American\nmagic. America was, in fact, greatly lauded and discussed, the case of\n\"Gaarge\" Lumsden being much quoted.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nKEDGERS\n\nThe work at Stornham Court went on steadily, though with no greater\nrapidity than is usually achieved by rural labourers. There was,\nhowever, without doubt, a certain stimulus in the occasional appearance\nof Miss Vanderpoel, who almost daily sauntered round the place to look\non, and exchange a few words with the workmen. When they saw her coming,\nthe men, hastily standing up to touch their foreheads, were conscious\nof a slight acceleration of being which was not quite the ordinary\nquickening produced by the presence of employers. It was, in fact, a\nsensation rather pleasing than anxious. Her interest in the work was,\nupon the whole, one which they found themselves beginning to share. The\nunusualness of the situation--a young woman, who evidently stood for\nmany things and powers desirable, employing labourers and seeming to\nknow what she intended them to do--was a thing not easy to get over, or\nbe come accustomed to. But there she was, as easy and well mannered as\nyou please--and with gentlefolks' ways, though, as an American, such\nfinish could scarcely be expected from her. She knew each man's name,\nit was revealed gradually, and, what was more, knew what he stood for\nin the village, what cottage he lived in, how many children he had, and\nsomething about his wife. She remembered things and made inquiries which\nshowed knowledge. Besides this, she represented, though perhaps they\nwere scarcely yet fully awake to the fact, the promise their discouraged\ndulness had long lost sight of.\n\nIt actually became apparent that her ladyship, who walked with her, was\naltering day by day. Was it true that the bit of colour they had heard\nspoken of when she returned from town was deepening and fixing itself\non her cheek? It sometimes looked like it. Was she a bit less stiff and\nshy-like and frightened in her way? Buttle mentioned to his friends at\nThe Clock that he was sure of it. She had begun to look a man in the\nface when she talked, and more than once he had heard her laugh at\nthings her sister said.\n\nTo one man more than to any other had come an almost unspeakable piece\nof luck through the new arrival--a thing which to himself, at least,\nwas as the opening of the heavens. This man was the discouraged Kedgers.\nMiss Vanderpoel, coming with her ladyship to talk to him, found that the\nman was a person of more experience than might have been imagined. In\nhis youth he had been an under gardener at a great place, and being fond\nof his work, had learned more than under gardeners often learn. He had\nbeen one of a small army of workers under the orders of an imposing head\ngardener, whose knowledge was a science. He had seen and taken part\nin what was done in orchid houses, orangeries, vineries, peach houses,\nconservatories full of wondrous tropical plants. But it was not easy for\na man like himself, uneducated and lacking confidence of character,\nto advance as a bolder young man might have done. The all-ruling head\ngardener had inspired him with awe. He had watched him reverently,\naccumulating knowledge, but being given, as an underling, no opportunity\nto do more than obey orders. He had spent his life in obeying, and\ncongratulated himself that obedience secured him his weekly wage.\n\n\"He was a great man--Mr. Timson--he was,\" he said, in talking to Miss\nVanderpoel. \"Ay, he was that. Knew everything that could happen to a\nflower or a s'rub or a vegetable. Knew it all. Had a lib'ery of books\nan' read 'em night an' day. Head gardener's cottage was good enough\nfor gentry. The old Markis used to walk round the hothouses an' gardens\ntalking to him by the hour. If you did what he told you EXACTLY like he\ntold it to you, then you were all right, but if you didn't--well, you\nwas off the place before you'd time to look round. Worked under him from\ntwenty to forty. Then he died an' the new one that came in had new ways.\nHe made a clean sweep of most of us. The men said he was jealous of Mr.\nTimson.\"\n\n\"That was bad for you, if you had a wife and children,\" Miss Vanderpoel\nsaid.\n\n\"Eight of us to feed,\" Kedgers answered. \"A man with that on him can't\nwait, miss. I had to take the first place I could get. It wasn't a good\none--poor parsonage with a big family an' not room on the place for the\nvegetables they wanted. Cabbages, an' potatoes, an' beans, an' broccoli.\nNo time nor ground for flowers. Used to seem as if flowers got to be a\nkind of dream.\" Kedgers gave vent to a deprecatory half laugh. \"Me--I\nwas fond of flowers. I wouldn't have asked no better than to live among\n'em. Mr. Timson gave me a book or two when his lordship sent him a\nlot of new ones. I've bought a few myself--though I suppose I couldn't\nafford it.\"\n\nFrom the poor parsonage he had gone to a market gardener, and had\nevidently liked the work better, hard and unceasing as it had been,\nbecause he had been among flowers again. Sudden changes from forcing\nhouses to chill outside dampness had resulted in rheumatism. After that\nthings had gone badly. He began to be regarded as past his prime of\nstrength. Lower wages and labour still as hard as ever, though it\nprofessed to be lighter, and therefore cheaper. At last the big\nneglected gardens of Stornham.\n\n\"What I'm seeing, miss, all the time, is what could be done with 'em.\nWonderful it'd be. They might be the show of the county-if we had Mr.\nTimson here.\"\n\nMiss Vanderpoel, standing in the sunshine on the broad weed-grown\npathway, was conscious that he was remotely moving. His flowers--his\nflowers. They had been the centre of his rudimentary rural being. Each\nman or woman cared for some one thing, and the unfed longing for it left\nthe life of the creature a thwarted passion. Kedgers, yearning to stir\nthe earth about the roots of blooming things, and doomed to broccoli and\ncabbage, had spent his years unfed. No thing is a small thing. Kedgers,\nwith the earth under his broad finger nails, and his half apologetic\nlaugh, being the centre of his own world, was as large as Mount Dunstan,\nwho stood thwarted in the centre of his. Chancing-for God knows what\nmystery of reason-to be born one of those having power, one might\nperhaps set in order a world like Kedgers'.\n\n\"In the course of twenty years' work under Timson,\" she said, \"you must\nhave learned a great deal from him.\"\n\n\"A good bit, miss-a good bit,\" admitted Kedgers. \"If I hadn't ha' cared\nfor the work, I might ha' gone on doing it with my eyes shut, but I\ndidn't. Mr. Timson's heart was set on it as well as his head. An' mine\ngot to be. But I wasn't even second or third under him--I was only one\nof a lot. He would have thought me fine an' impident if I'd told him I'd\ngot to know a good deal of what he knew--and had some bits of ideas of\nmy own.\"\n\n\"If you had men enough under you, and could order all you want,\" Miss\nVanderpoel said tentatively, \"you know what the place should be, no\ndoubt.\"\n\n\"That I do, miss,\" answered Kedgers, turning red with feeling. \"Why, if\nthe soil was well treated, anything would grow here. There's situations\nfor everything. There's shade for things that wants it, and south\naspects for things that won't grow without the warmth of 'em. Well, I've\ngone about many a day when I was low down in my mind and worked myself\nup to being cheerful by just planning where I could put things and what\nthey'd look like. Liliums, now, I could grow them in masses from June to\nOctober.\" He was becoming excited, like a war horse scenting battle from\nafar, and forgot himself. \"The Lilium Giganteum--I don't know whether\nyou've ever seen one, miss--but if you did, it'd almost take your breath\naway. A Lilium that grows twelve feet high and more, and has a flower\nlike a great snow-white trumpet, and the scent pouring out of it so that\nit floats for yards. There's a place where I could grow them so that\nyou'd come on them sudden, and you'd think they couldn't be true.\"\n\n\"Grow them, Kedgers, begin to grow them,\" said Miss Vanderpoel. \"I have\nnever seen them--I must see them.\"\n\nKedgers' low, deprecatory chuckle made itself heard again,\n\n\"Perhaps I'm going too fast,\" he said. \"It would take a good bit of\nexpense to do it, miss. A good bit.\"\n\nThen Miss Vanderpoel made--and she made it in the simplest\nmatter-of-fact manner, too--the startling remark which, three hours\nlater, all Stornham village had heard of. The most astounding part of\nthe remark was that it was uttered as if there was nothing in it which\nwas not the absolutely natural outcome of the circumstances of the case.\n\n\"Expense which is proper and necessary need not be considered,\" she\nsaid. \"Regular accounts will be kept and supervised, but you can have\nall that is required.\"\n\nThen it appeared that Kedgers almost became pale. Being a foreigner,\nperhaps she did not know how much she was implying when she said such a\nthing to a man who had never held a place like Timson's.\n\n\"Miss,\" he hesitated, even shamefacedly, because to suggest to such\na fine-mannered, calm young lady that she might be ignorant, seemed\nperilously near impertinence. \"Miss, did you mean you wanted only the\nLilium Giganteum, or--or other things, as well.\"\n\n\"I should like to see,\" she answered him, \"all that you see. I should\nlike to hear more of it all, when we have time to talk it over. I\nunderstand we should need time to discuss plans.\"\n\nThe quiet way she went on! Seeming to believe in him, almost as if he\nwas Mr. Timson. The old feeling, born and fostered by the great head\ngardener's rule, reasserted itself.\n\n\"It means more to work--and someone over them, miss,\" he said. \"If--if\nyou had a man like Mr. Timson----\"\n\n\"You have not forgotten what you learned. With men enough under you it\ncan be put into practice.\"\n\n\"You mean you'd trust me, miss--same as if I was Mr. Timson?\"\n\n\"Yes. If you ever feel the need of a man like Timson, no doubt we can\nfind one. But you will not. You love the work too much.\"\n\nThen still standing in the sunshine, on the weed-grown path, she\ncontinued to talk to him. It revealed itself that she understood a good\ndeal. As he was to assume heavier responsibilities, he was to receive\nhigher wages. It was his experience which was to be considered, not his\nyears. This was a new point of view. The mere propeller of wheel-barrows\nand digger of the soil--particularly after having been attacked by\nrheumatism--depreciates in value after youth is past. Kedgers knew that\na Mr. Timson, with a regiment of under gardeners, and daily increasing\nknowledge of his profession, could continue to direct, though years\nrolled by. But to such fortune he had not dared to aspire.\n\nOne of the lodges might be put in order for him to live in. He might\nhave the hothouses to put in order, too; he might have implements,\nplants, shrubs, even some of the newer books to consult. Kedgers' brain\nreeled.\n\n\"You--think I am to be trusted, miss?\" he said more than once. \"You\nthink it would be all right? I wasn't even second or third under Mr.\nTimson--but--if I say it as shouldn't--I never lost a chance of learning\nthings. I was just mad about it. T'aint only Liliums--Lord, I know 'em\nall, as if they were my own children born an' bred--shrubs, coniferas,\nherbaceous borders that bloom in succession. My word! what you can do\nwith just delphiniums an' campanula an' acquilegia an' poppies, everyday\nthings like them, that'll grow in any cottage garden, an' bulbs\nan' annuals! Roses, miss--why, Mr. Timson had them in thickets--an'\ncarpets--an' clambering over trees and tumbling over walls in sheets an'\ntorrents--just know their ways an' what they want, an' they'll grow in\na riot. But they want feeding--feeding. A rose is a gross feeder. Feed\na Glory deejon, and watch over him, an' he'll cover a housetop an' give\nyou two bloomings.\"\n\n\"I have never lived in an English garden. I should like to see this one\nat its best.\"\n\nLeaving her with salutes of abject gratitude, Kedgers moved away\nbewildered. What man could believe it true? At three or four yards'\ndistance he stopped and, turning, came back to touch his cap again.\n\n\"You understand, miss,\" he said. \"I wasn't even second or third under\nMr. Timson. I'm not deceiving you, am I, miss?\"\n\n\"You are to be trusted,\" said Miss Vanderpoel, \"first because you love\nthe things--and next because of Timson.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nONE OF MR. VANDERPOEL'S LETTERS\n\nMr. Germen, the secretary of the great Mr. Vanderpoel, in arranging\nthe neat stacks of letters preparatory to his chief's entrance to\nhis private room each morning, knowing where each should be placed,\nunderstood that such as were addressed in Miss Vanderpoel's hand would\nbe read before anything else. This had been the case even when she had\njust been placed in a French school, a tall, slim little girl, with\nimmense demanding eyes, and a thick black plait of hair swinging between\nher straight, rather thin, shoulders. Between other financial potentates\nand their little girls, Mr. Germen knew that the oddly confidential\nrelation which existed between these two was unusual. Her schoolgirl\nletters, it had been understood, should be given the first place on\nthe stacks of envelopes each incoming ocean steamer brought in its mail\nbags. Since the beginning of her visit to her sister, Lady Anstruthers,\nthe exact dates of mail steamers seemed to be of increased importance.\nMiss Vanderpoel evidently found much to write about. Each steamer\nbrought a full-looking envelope to be placed in a prominent position.\n\nOn a hot morning in the early summer Mr. Germen found two or three--two\nof them of larger size and seeming to contain business papers. These\nhe placed where they would be seen at once. Mr. Vanderpoel was a little\nlater than usual in his arrival. At this season he came from his place\nin the country, and before leaving it this morning he had been talking\nto his wife, whom he found rather disturbed by a chance encounter with\na young woman who had returned to visit her mother after a year spent in\nEngland with her English husband. This young woman, now Lady Bowen, once\nMilly Jones, had been one of the amusing marvels of New York. A girl\nneither rich nor so endowed by nature as to be able to press upon the\nworld any special claim to consideration as a beauty, her enterprise,\nand the daring of her tactics, had been the delight of many a satiric\nonlooker. In her schooldays she had ingenuously mapped out her future\ncareer. Other American girls married men with titles, and she intended\nto do the same thing. The other little girls laughed, but they liked to\nhear her talk. All information regarding such unions as was to be\nfound in the newspapers and magazines, she collected and studiously\nread--sometimes aloud to her companions.\n\nSocial paragraphs about royalties, dukes and duchesses, lords and\nladies, court balls and glittering functions, she devoured and learned\nby heart. An abominably vulgar little person, she was an interestingly\npertinacious creature, and wrought night and day at acquiring an air of\nfashionable elegance, at first naturally laying it on in such manner\nas suggested that it should be scraped off with a knife, but with\nexperience gaining a certain specious knowledge of forms. How\nthe over-mature child at school had assimilated her uncanny young\nworldliness, it would have been less difficult to decide, if possible\nsources had been less numerous. The air was full of it, the literature\nof the day, the chatter of afternoon teas, the gossip of the hour.\nBefore she was fifteen she saw the indiscretion of her childish\nfrankness, and realised that it might easily be detrimental to her\nambitions. She said no more of her plans for her future, and even took\nthe astute tone of carelessly treating as a joke her vulgar little past.\nBut no titled foreigner appeared upon the horizon without setting her\nsmall, but business-like, brain at work. Her lack of wealth and assured\nposition made her situation rather hopeless. She was not of the class\nof lucky young women whose parents' gorgeous establishments offered\nattractions to wandering persons of rank. She and her mother lived in\na flat, and gave rather pathetic afternoon teas in return for such\nmore brilliant hospitalities as careful and pertinacious calling and\nrecalling obliged their acquaintances to feel they could not decently be\nleft wholly out of. Milly and her anxious mother had worked hard. They\nlost no opportunity of writing a note, or sending a Christmas card, or\nan economical funeral wreath. By daily toil and the amicable ignoring\nof casualness of manner or slights, they managed to cling to the edge of\nthe precipice of social oblivion, into whose depths a lesser degree\nof assiduity, or a greater sensitiveness, would have plunged them.\nOnce--early in Milly's career, when her ever-ready chatter and her\nsuperficial brightness were a novelty, it had seemed for a short time\nthat luck might be glancing towards her. A young man of foreign title\nand of Bohemian tastes met her at a studio dance, and, misled by the\nsmartness of her dress and her always carefully carried air of careless\nprosperity, began to pay a delusive court to her. For a few weeks all\nher freshest frocks were worn assiduously and credit was strained to buy\nnew ones. The flat was adorned with fresh flowers and several new yellow\nand pale blue cushions appeared at the little teas, which began to\nassume a more festive air. Desirable people, who went ordinarily to\nthe teas at long intervals and through reluctant weakness, or sometimes\nrebellious amiability, were drummed up and brought firmly to the fore.\nMilly herself began to look pink and fluffy through mere hopeful\ngood spirits. Her thin little laugh was heard incessantly, and people\namusedly if they were good-tempered, derisively if they were spiteful,\nwondered if it really would come to something. But it did not. The\nyoung foreigner suddenly left New York, making his adieus with entire\nlightness. There was the end of it. He had heard something about lack\nof income and uncertainty of credit, which had suggested to him that\ndiscretion was the better part of valour. He married later a young lady\nin the West, whose father was a solid person.\n\nLess astute young women, under the circumstances, would have allowed\nthemselves a week or so of headache or influenza, but Milly did not. She\nmade calls in the new frocks, and with such persistent spirit that she\nfished forth from the depths of indifferent hospitality two or three\nexcellent invitations. She wore her freshest pink frock, and an\namazingly clever little Parisian diamond crescent in her hair, at the\nhuge Monson ball at Delmonico's, and it was recorded that it was on that\nglittering occasion that her \"Uncle James\" was first brought upon the\nscene. He was only mentioned lightly at first. It was to Milly's credit\nthat he was not made too much of. He was casually touched upon as a very\nrich uncle, who lived in Dakota, and had actually lived there since his\nyouth, letting his few relations know nothing of him. He had been rather\na black sheep as a boy, but Milly's mother had liked him, and, when he\nhad run away from New York, he had told her what he was going to do, and\nhad kissed her when she cried, and had taken her daguerreotype with him.\nNow he had written, and it turned out that he was enormously rich,\nand was interested in Milly. From that time Uncle James formed an\natmosphere. He did not appear in New York, but Milly spent the next\nseason in London, and the Monsons, being at Hurlingham one day, had\nher pointed out to them as a new American girl, who was the idol of a\nmillionaire uncle. She was not living in an ultra fashionable quarter,\nor with ultra fashionable people, but she was, on all occasions, they\nheard, beautifully dressed and beautifully--if a little heavily--hung\nwith gauds and gems, her rings being said to be quite amazing and\nsuggesting an impassioned lavishness on the part of Uncle James. London,\nhaving become inured to American marvels--Milly's bit of it--accepted\nand enjoyed Uncle James and all the sumptuous attributes of his Dakota.\n\nEnglish people would swallow anything sometimes, Mrs. Monson commented\nsagely, and yet sometimes they stared and evidently thought you were\nlying about the simplest things. Milly's corner of South Kensington had\ngulped down the Dakota uncle. Her managing in this way, if there was no\nuncle, was too clever and amusing. She had left her mother at home to\nscrimp and save, and by hook or by crook she had contrived to get a\nnumber of quite good things to wear. She wore them with such an air of\naccustomed resource that the jewels might easily--mixed with some\nrelics of her mother's better days--be of the order of the clever little\nParisian diamond crescent. It was Milly's never-laid-aside manner which\ndid it. The announcement of her union with Sir Arthur Bowen was received\nin certain New York circles with little suppressed shrieks of glee. It\nhad been so sharp of her to aim low and to realise so quickly that she\ncould not aim high. The baronetcy was a recent one, and not unconnected\nwith trade. Sir Arthur was not a rich man, and, had it leaked out,\nbelieved in Uncle James. If he did not find him all his fancy painted,\nMilly was clever enough to keep him quiet. She was, when all was said\nand done, one of the American women of title, her servants and the\ntradespeople addressed her as \"my lady,\" and with her capacity\nfor appropriating what was most useful, and her easy assumption of\npossessing all required, she was a very smart person indeed. She\nprovided herself with an English accent, an English vocabulary, and an\nEnglish manner, and in certain circles was felt to be most impressive.\n\nAt an afternoon function in the country Mrs. Vanderpoel had met Lady\nBowen. She had been one of the few kindly ones, who in the past had\ngiven an occasional treat to Milly Jones for her girlhood's sake. Lady\nBowen, having gathered a small group of hearers, was talking volubly to\nit, when the nice woman entered, and, catching sight of her, she swept\nacross the room. It would not have been like Milly to fail to see and\ngreet at once the wife of Reuben Vanderpoel. She would count anywhere,\neven in London sets it was not easy to connect one's self with. She had\nalready discovered that there were almost as many difficulties to be\nsurmounted in London by the wife of an unimportant baronet as there had\nbeen to be overcome in New York by a girl without money or place. It was\nwell to have something in the way of information to offer in one's small\ntalk with the lucky ones and Milly knew what subject lay nearest to Mrs.\nVanderpoel's heart.\n\n\"Miss Vanderpoel has evidently been enjoying her visit to Stornham\nCourt,\" she said, after her first few sentences. \"I met Mrs. Worthington\nat the Embassy, and she said she had buried herself in the country. But\nI think she must have run up to town quietly for shopping. I saw her one\nday in Piccadilly, and I was almost sure Lady Anstruthers was with her\nin the carriage--almost sure.\"\n\nMrs. Vanderpoel's heart quickened its beat.\n\n\"You were so young when she married,\" she said. \"I daresay you have\nforgotten her face.\"\n\n\"Oh, no!\" Milly protested effusively. \"I remember her quite well. She\nwas so pretty and pink and happy-looking, and her hair curled naturally.\nI used to pray every night that when I grew up I might have hair and a\ncomplexion like hers.\"\n\nMrs. Vanderpoel's kind, maternal face fell.\n\n\"And you were not sure you recognised her? Well, I suppose twelve years\ndoes make a difference,\" her voice dragging a little.\n\nMilly saw that she had made a blunder. The fact was she had not even\nguessed at Rosy's identity until long after the carriage had passed her.\n\n\"Oh, you see,\" she hesitated, \"their carriage was not near me, and I was\nnot expecting to see them. And perhaps she looked a little delicate. I\nheard she had been rather delicate.\"\n\nShe felt she was floundering, and bravely floundered away from the\nsubject. She plunged into talk of Betty and people's anxiety to see her,\nand the fact that the society columns were already faintly heralding\nher. She would surely come soon to town. It was too late for the first\nDrawing-room this year. When did Mrs. Vanderpoel think she would be\npresented? Would Lady Anstruthers present her? Mrs. Vanderpoel could not\nbring her back to Rosy, and the nature of the change which had made it\ndifficult to recognise her.\n\nThe result of this chance encounter was that she did not sleep very\nwell, and the next morning talked anxiously to her husband.\n\n\"What I could see, Reuben, was that Milly Bowen had not known her at\nall, even when she saw her in the carriage with Betty. She couldn't have\nchanged as much as that, if she had been taken care of, and happy.\"\n\nHer affection and admiration for her husband were such as made the task\nof soothing her a comparatively simple thing. The instinct of tenderness\nfor the mate his youth had chosen was an unchangeable one in Reuben\nVanderpoel. He was not a primitive man, but in this he was as\nunquestioningly simple as if he had been a kindly New England farmer. He\nhad outgrown his wife, but he had always loved and protected her gentle\ngoodness. He had never failed her in her smallest difficulty, he could\nnot bear to see her hurt. Betty had been his compeer and his companion\nalmost since her childhood, but his wife was the tenderest care of his\ndays. There was a strong sense of relief in his thought of Betty now. It\nwas good to remember the fineness of her perceptions, her clearness of\njudgment, and recall that they were qualities he might rely upon.\n\nWhen he left his wife to take his train to town, he left her smiling\nagain. She scarcely knew how her fears had been dispelled. His talk had\nall been kindly, practical, and reasonable. It was true Betty had said\nin her letter that Rosy had been rather delicate, and had not been\ntaking very good care of herself, but that was to be remedied. Rosy had\nmade a little joke or so about it herself.\n\n\"Betty says I am not fat enough for an English matron. I am drinking\nmilk and breakfasting in bed, and am going to be massaged to please her.\nI believe we all used to obey Betty when she was a child, and now she is\nso tall and splendid, one would never dare to cross her. Oh, mother! I\nam so happy at having her with me!\"\n\nTo reread just these simple things caused the suggestion of things not\ncomfortably normal to melt away. Mrs. Vanderpoel sat down at a\nsunny window with her lap full of letters, and forgot Milly Bowen's\nfloundering.\n\nWhen Mr. Vanderpoel reached his office and glanced at his carefully\narranged morning's mail, Mr. Germen saw him smile at the sight of the\nenvelopes addressed in his daughter's hand. He sat down to read them at\nonce, and, as he read, the smile of welcome became a shrewd and deeply\ninterested one.\n\n\"She has undertaken a good-sized contract,\" he was saying to himself,\n\"and she's to be trusted to see it through. It is rather fine, the\nway she manages to combine emotions and romance and sentiments with\npractical good business, without letting one interfere with the other.\nIt's none of it bad business this, as the estate is entailed, and the\nboy is Rosy's. It's good business.\"\n\nThis was what Betty had written to her father in New York from Stornham\nCourt.\n\n\"The things I am beginning to do, it would be impossible for me to\nresist doing, and it would certainly be impossible for you. The thing I\nam seeing I have never seen, at close hand, before, though I have taken\nin something almost its parallel as part of certain picturesqueness of\nscenes in other countries. But I am LIVING with this and also, through\nrelationship to Rosy, I, in a measure, belong to it, and it belongs\nto me. You and I may have often seen in American villages crudeness,\nincompleteness, lack of comfort, and the composition of a picture,\na rough ugliness the result of haste and unsettled life which stays\nnowhere long, but packs up its goods and chattels and wanders farther\nafield in search of something better or worse, in any case in search\nof change, but we have never seen ripe, gradual falling to ruin of what\ngenerations ago was beautiful. To me it is wonderful and tragic and\ntouching. If you could see the Court, if you could see the village,\nif you could see the church, if you could see the people, all quietly\ndisintegrating, and so dearly perfect in their way that if one knew\nabsolutely that nothing could be done to save them, one could only stand\nstill and catch one's breath and burst into tears. The church has stood\nsince the Conquest, and, as it still stands, grey and fine, with its\nmass of square tower, and despite the state of its roof, is not yet\ngiven wholly to the winds and weather, it will, no doubt, stand a few\ncenturies longer. The Court, however, cannot long remain a possible\nhabitation, if it is not given a new lease of life. I do not mean that\nit will crumble to-morrow, or the day after, but we should not think\nit habitable now, even while we should admit that nothing could be more\ndelightful to look at. The cottages in the village are already, many of\nthem, amazing, when regarded as the dwellings of human beings. How long\nago the cottagers gave up expecting that anything in particular would be\ndone for them, I do not know. I am impressed by the fact that they are\nan unexpecting people. Their calm non-expectancy fills me with interest.\nOnly centuries of waiting for their superiors in rank to do things\nfor them, and the slow formation of the habit of realising that not\nto submit to disappointment was no use, could have produced the almost\nSERENITY of their attitude. It is all very well for newborn republican\nnations--meaning my native land--to sniff sternly and say that such a\nstate of affairs is an insult to the spirit of the race. Perhaps it\nis now, but it was not apparently centuries ago, which was when it all\nbegan and when 'Man' and the 'Race' had not developed to the point of\nasking questions, to which they demand replies, about themselves and\nthe things which happened to them. It began in the time of Egbert\nand Canute, and earlier, in the days of the Druids, when they used\npeacefully to allow themselves to be burned by the score, enclosed\nin wicker idols, as natural offerings to placate the gods. The modern\nacceptance of things is only a somewhat attenuated remnant of the\nancient idea. And this is what I have to deal with and understand.\nWhen I begin to do the things I am going to do, with the aid of your\npractical advice, if I have your approval, the people will be at first\nrather afraid of me. They will privately suspect I am mad. It\nwill, also, not seem at all unlikely that an American should be of\nunreasoningly extravagant and flighty mind. Stornham, having long\nslumbered in remote peace through lack of railroad convenience, still\nregards America as almost of the character of wild rumour. Rosy was\ntheir one American, and she disappeared from their view so soon that\nshe had not time to make any lasting impression. I am asking myself how\ndifficult, or how simple, it will be to quite understand these people,\nand to make them understand me. I greatly doubt its being simple. Layers\nand layers and layers of centuries must be far from easy to burrow\nthrough. They look simple, they do not know that they are not simple,\nbut really they are not. Their point of view has been the point of view\nof the English peasant so many hundred years that an American point of\nview, which has had no more than a trifling century and a half to form\nitself in, may find its thews and sinews the less powerful of the\ntwo. When I walk down the village street, faces appear at windows, and\nfigures, stolidly, at doors. What I see is that, vaguely and remotely,\nAmerican though I am, the fact that I am of 'her ladyship's blood,'\nand that her ladyship--American though she is--has the claim on them of\nbeing the mother of the son of the owner of the land--stirs in them a\nfeeling that I have a shadowy sort of relationship in the whole thing,\nand with regard to their bad roofs and bad chimneys, to their broken\npalings, and damp floors, to their comforts and discomforts, a sort of\nresponsibility. That is the whole thing, and you--just you, father--will\nunderstand me when I say that I actually like it. I might not like it\nif I were poor Rosy, but, being myself, I love it. There is something\npatriarchal in it which moves me.\n\n\"Is it an abounding and arrogant delight in power which makes it appeal\nto me, or is it something better? To feel that every man on the\nland, every woman, every child knew one, counted on one's honour and\nfriendship, turned to one believingly in time of stress, to know that\none could help and be a finely faithful thing, the very knowledge of\nit would give one vigour and warm blood in the veins. I wish I had been\nborn to it, I wish the first sounds falling on my newborn ears had been\nthe clanging of the peal from an old Norman church tower, calling out\nto me, 'Welcome; newcomer of our house, long life among us! Welcome!'\nStill, though the first sounds that greeted me were probably the\nrattling of a Fifth Avenue stage, I have brought them SOMETHING, and\nwho knows whether I could have brought it from without the range of that\nprosaic, but cheerful, rattle.\"\n\nThe rest of the letter was detail of a business-like order. A large\nenvelope contained the detail-notes of things to be done, notes\nconcerning roofs, windows, flooring, park fences, gardens, greenhouses,\ntool houses, potting sheds, garden walls, gates, woodwork, masonry.\nSharp little sketches, such as Buttle had seen, notes concerning Buttle,\nFox, Tread, Kedgers, and less accomplished workmen; concerning wages\nof day labourers, hours, capabilities. Buttle, if he had chanced to see\nthem, would have broken into a light perspiration at the idea of a young\nwoman having compiled the documents. He had never heard of the first\nReuben Vanderpoel.\n\nHer father's reply to Betty was as long as her own to him, and gave her\nkeen pleasure by its support, both of sympathetic interest and practical\nadvice. He left none of her points unnoted, and dealt with each of them\nas she had most hoped and indeed had felt she knew he would. This was\nhis final summing up:\n\n\"If you had been a boy, and I own I am glad you were not--a man wants a\ndaughter--I should have been quite willing to allow you your flutter on\nWall Street, or your try at anything you felt you would like to handle.\nIt would have interested me to look on and see what you were made of,\nwhat you wanted, and how you set about trying to get it. It's a new kind\nof deal you have undertaken. It's more romantic than Wall Street, but I\nthink I do see what you see in it. Even apart from Rosy and the boy,\nit would interest me to see what you would do with it. This is your\n'flutter.' I like the way you face it. If you were a son instead of\na daughter, I should see I might have confidence in you. I could not\nconfide to Wall Street what I will tell you--which is that in the midst\nof the drive and swirl and tumult of my life here, I like what you see\nin the thing, I like your idea of the lord of the land, who should love\nthe land and the souls born on it, and be the friend and strength of\nthem and give the best and get it back in fair exchange. There's a\nsteadiness in the thought of such a life among one's kind which has\nattractions for a man who has spent years in a maelstrom, snatching at\nwhat whirls among the eddies of it. Your notes and sketches and summing\nup of probable costs did us both credit--I say 'both' because your\nbusiness education is the result of our long talks and journeyings\ntogether. You began to train for this when you began going to visit\nmines and railroads with me at twelve years old. I leave the whole thing\nin your hands, my girl, I leave Rosy in your hands, and in leaving Rosy\nto you, you know how I am trusting you with your mother. Your letters to\nher tell her only what is good for her. She is beginning to look happier\nand younger already, and is looking forward to the day when Rosy and\nthe boy will come home to visit us, and when we shall go in state to\nStornham Court. God bless her, she is made up of affection and simple\ntrust, and that makes it easy to keep things from her. She has never\nbeen ill-treated, and she knows I love her, so when I tell her that\nthings are coming right, she never doubts me.\n\n\"While you are rebuilding the place you will rebuild Rosy so that the\nsight of her may not be a pain when her mother sees her again, which is\nwhat she is living for.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nINTRODUCING G. SELDEN\n\nA bird was perched upon a swaying branch of a slim young sapling near\nthe fence-supported hedge which bounded the park, and Mount Dunstan had\nstopped to look at it and listen. A soft shower had fallen, and after\nits passing, the sun coming through the light clouds, there had broken\nforth again in the trees brief trills and calls and fluting of bird\nnotes. The sward and ferns glittered fresh green under the raindrops;\nthe young leaves on trees and hedge seemed visibly to uncurl, the\nuncovered earth looked richly dark and moist, and sent forth the\nfragrance from its deeps, which, rising to a man's nostrils, stirs and\nthrills him because it is the scent of life's self. The bird upon the\nsapling was a robin, the tiny round body perched upon his delicate legs,\nplump and bright plumaged for mating. He touched his warm red breast\nwith his beak, fluffed out and shook his feathers, and, swelling his\nthroat, poured forth his small, entranced song. It was a gay, brief,\njaunty thing, but pure, joyous, gallant, liquid melody. There was dainty\nbravado in it, saucy demand and allurement. It was addressed to some\ninvisible hearer of the tender sex, and wheresoever she might be\nhidden--whether in great branch or low thicket or hedge--there was\nhinted no doubt in her small wooer's note that she would hear it and\nin due time respond. Mount Dunstan, listening, even laughed at its\nconfident music. The tiny thing uttering its Call of the World--jubilant\nin the surety of answer!\n\nHaving flung it forth, he paused a moment and waited, his small\nhead turned sideways, his big, round, dew-bright black eye roguishly\nattentive. Then with more swelling of the throat he trilled and rippled\ngayly anew, undisturbed and undoubting, but with a trifle of insistence.\nThen he listened, tried again two or three times, with brave chirps\nand exultant little roulades. \"Here am I, the bright-breasted, the\nliquid-eyed, the slender-legged, the joyous and conquering! Listen to\nme--listen to me. Listen and answer in the call of God's world.\" It was\nthe joy and triumphant faith in the tiny note of the tiny thing--Life\nas he himself was, though Life whose mystery his man's hand could have\ncrushed--which, while he laughed, set Mount Dunstan thinking. Spring\nwarmth and spring scents and spring notes set a man's being in tune with\ninfinite things.\n\nThe bright roulade began again, prolonged itself with renewed effort,\nrose to its height, and ended. From a bush in the thicket farther up the\nroad a liquid answer came. And Mount Dunstan's laugh at the sound of it\nwas echoed by another which came apparently from the bank rising from\nthe road on the other side of the hedge, and accompanying the laugh was\na good-natured nasal voice.\n\n\"She's caught on. There's no mistake about that. I guess it's time for\nyou to hustle, Mr. Rob.\"\n\nMount Dunstan laughed again. Jem Salter had heard voices like it, and\ncheerful slang phrases of the same order in his ranch days. On the other\nside of his park fence there was evidently sitting, through some odd\nchance, an American of the cheery, casual order, not sufficiently\npolished by travel to have lost his picturesque national\ncharacteristics.\n\nMount Dunstan put a hand on a broken panel of fence and leaped over into\nthe road.\n\nA bicycle was lying upon the roadside grass, and on the bank, looking as\nthough he had been sheltering himself under the hedge from the rain, sat\na young man in a cheap bicycling suit. His features were sharply cut and\nkeen, his cap was pushed back from his forehead, and he had a pair of\nshrewdly careless boyish eyes.\n\nMount Dunstan liked the look of him, and seeing his natural start at the\nunheralded leap over the gap, which was quite close to him, he spoke.\n\n\"Good-morning,\" he said. \"I am afraid I startled you.\"\n\n\"Good-morning,\" was the response. \"It was a bit of a jolt seeing you\njump almost over my shoulder. Where did you come from? You must have\nbeen just behind me.\"\n\n\"I was,\" explained Mount Dunstan. \"Standing in the park listening to the\nrobin.\"\n\nThe young fellow laughed outright.\n\n\"Say,\" he said, \"that was pretty fine, wasn't it? Wasn't he getting it\noff his chest! He was an English robin, I guess. American robins are\nthree or four times as big. I liked that little chap. He was a winner.\"\n\n\"You are an American?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" nodding. \"Good old Stars and Stripes for mine. First time I've\nbeen here. Came part for business and part for pleasure. Having the time\nof my life.\"\n\nMount Dunstan sat down beside him. He wanted to hear him talk. He had\nliked to hear the ranchmen talk. This one was of the city type, but his\ngenial conversational wanderings would be full of quaint slang and good\nspirits. He was quite ready to converse, as was made manifest by his\nnext speech.\n\n\"I'm biking through the country because I once had an old grandmother\nthat was English, and she was always talking about English country, and\nhow green things was, and how there was hedges instead of rail fences.\nShe thought there was nothing like little old England. Well, as far as\nroads and hedges go, I'm with her. They're all right. I wanted a fellow\nI met crossing, to come with me, but he took a Cook's trip to Paris.\nHe's a gay sort of boy. Said he didn't want any green lanes in his. He\nwanted Boolyvard.\" He laughed again and pushed his cap farther back on\nhis forehead. \"Said I wasn't much of a sport. I tell YOU, a chap that's\ngot to earn his fifteen per, and live on it, can't be TOO much of a\nsport.\"\n\n\"Fifteen per?\" Mount Dunstan repeated doubtfully.\n\nHis companion chuckled.\n\n\"I forgot I was talking to an Englishman. Fifteen dollars per\nweek--that's what 'fifteen per' means. That's what he told me he gets at\nLobenstien's brewery in New York. Fifteen per. Not much, is it?\"\n\n\"How does he manage Continental travel on fifteen per?\" Mount Dunstan\ninquired.\n\n\"He's a typewriter and stenographer, and he dug up some extra jobs to do\nat night. He's been working and saving two years to do this. We didn't\ncome over on one of the big liners with the Four Hundred, you can bet.\nTook a cheap one, inside cabin, second class.\"\n\n\"By George!\" said Mount Dunstan. \"That was American.\"\n\nThe American eagle slightly flapped his wings. The young man pushed his\ncap a trifle sideways this time, and flushed a little.\n\n\"Well, when an American wants anything he generally reaches out for it.\"\n\n\"Wasn't it rather--rash, considering the fifteen per?\" Mount Dunstan\nsuggested. He was really beginning to enjoy himself.\n\n\"What's the use of making a dollar and sitting on it. I've not got\nfifteen per--steady--and here I am.\"\n\nMount Dunstan knew his man, and looked at him with inquiring interest.\nHe was quite sure he would go on. This was a thing he had seen\nbefore--an utter freedom from the insular grudging reserve, a sort of\noccult perception of the presence of friendly sympathy, and an ingenuous\nreadiness to meet it half way. The youngster, having missed his\nfellow-traveler, and probably feeling the lack of companionship in his\ncountry rides, was in the mood for self-revelation.\n\n\"I'm selling for a big concern,\" he said, \"and I've got a first-class\narticle to carry. Up to date, you know, and all that. It's the top notch\nof typewriting machines, the Delkoff. Ever seen it? Here's my card,\"\ntaking a card from an inside pocket and handing it to him. It was\ninscribed:\n\nJ. BURRIDGE & SON,\n\nDELKOFF TYPEWRITER CO.\n\nBROADWAY, NEW YORK. G. SELDEN.\n\n\n\"That's my name,\" he said, pointing to the inscription in the corner.\n\"I'm G. Selden, the junior assistant of Mr. Jones.\"\n\nAt the sight of the insignia of his trade, his holiday air dropped from\nhim, and he hastily drew from another pocket an illustrated catalogue.\n\n\"If you use a typewriter,\" he broke forth, \"I can assure you it would\nbe to your interest to look at this.\" And as Mount Dunstan took the\nproffered pamphlet, and with amiable gravity opened it, he rapidly\npoured forth his salesman's patter, scarcely pausing to take his breath:\n\"It's the most up-to-date machine on the market. It has all the latest\nimproved mechanical appliances. You will see from the cut in the\ncatalogue that the platen roller is easily removed without a long\nmechanical operation. All you do is to slip two pins back and off comes\nthe roller. There is also another point worth mentioning--the ribbon\nswitch. By using this ribbon switch you can write in either red or blue\nink while you are using only one ribbon. By throwing the switch on this\nside, you can use thirteen yards on the upper edge of the ribbon, by\nreversing it, you use thirteen yards on the lower edge--thus getting\npractically twenty-six yards of good, serviceable ribbon out of one that\nis only thirteen yards long--making a saving of fifty per cent. in your\nribbon expenditure alone, which you will see is quite an item to any\nenterprising firm.\"\n\nHe was obliged to pause here for a second or so, but as Mount Dunstan\nexhibited no signs of intending to use violence, and, on the contrary,\ncontinued to inspect the catalogue, he broke forth with renewed cheery\nvolubility:\n\n\"Another advantage is the new basket shift. Also, the carriage on this\nmachine is perfectly stationary and rigid. On all other machines it\nis fastened by a series of connecting bolts and links, which you will\nreadily understand makes perfect alignment uncertain. Then our tabulator\nis a part and parcel of the instrument, costing you nothing more than\nthe original price of the machine, which is one hundred dollars--without\ndiscount.\"\n\n\"It seems a good thing,\" said Mount Dunstan. \"If I had much business to\ntransact, I should buy one.\"\n\n\"If you bought one you'd HAVE business,\" responded Selden. \"That's\nwhat's the matter. It's the up-to-date machines that set things humming.\nA slow, old-fashioned typewriter uses a firm's time, and time's money.\"\n\n\"I don't find it so,\" said Mount Dunstan. \"I have more time than I can\npossibly use--and no money.\"\n\nG. Selden looked at him with friendly interest. His experience,\nwhich was varied, had taught him to recognize symptoms. This nice,\nrough-looking chap, who, despite his rather shabby clothes, looked like\na gentleman, wore an expression Jones's junior assistant had seen many\na time before. He had seen it frequently on the countenances of other\njunior assistants who had tramped the streets and met more or less\nsavage rebuffs through a day's length, without disposing of a single\nDelkoff, and thereby adding five dollars to the ten per. It was the kind\nof thing which wiped the youth out of a man's face and gave him a\nhard, worn look about the eyes. He had looked like that himself many an\nunfeeling day before he had learned to \"know the ropes and not mind a\nbit of hot air.\" His buoyant, slangy soul was a friendly thing. He was a\ngregarious creature, and liked his fellow man. He felt, indeed, more at\nease with him when he needed \"jollying along.\" Reticence was not even\netiquette in a case as usual as this.\n\n\"Say,\" he broke out, \"perhaps I oughtn't to have worried you. Are you up\nagainst it? Down on your luck, I mean,\" in hasty translation.\n\nMount Dunstan grinned a little.\n\n\"That's a very good way of putting it,\" he answered. \"I never heard 'up\nagainst it' before. It's good. Yes, I'm up against it.\n\n\"Out of a job?\" with genial sympathy.\n\n\"Well, the job I had was too big for me. It needed capital.\" He grinned\nslightly again, recalling a phrase of his Western past. \"I'm afraid I'm\ndown and out.\"\n\n\"No, you're not,\" with cheerful scorn. \"You're not dead, are you? S'long\nas a man's not been dead a month, there's always a chance that there's\nluck round the corner. How did you happen here? Are you piking it?\"\n\nMomentarily Mount Dunstan was baffled. G. Selden, recognising the fact,\nenlightened him. \"That's New York again,\" he said, with a boyish touch\nof apology. \"It means on the tramp. Travelling along the turnpike. You\ndon't look as if you had come to that--though it's queer the sort of\nfellows you do meet piking sometimes. Theatrical companies that have\ngone to pieces on the road, you know. Perhaps--\" with a sudden thought,\n\"you're an actor. Are you?\"\n\nMount Dunstan admitted to himself that he liked the junior assistant of\nJones immensely. A more ingenuously common young man, a more innocent\noutsider, it had never been his blessed privilege to enter into close\nconverse with, but his very commonness was a healthy, normal thing.\nIt made no effort to wreathe itself with chaplets of elegance; it\nwas beautifully unaware that such adornment was necessary. It enjoyed\nitself, youthfully; attacked the earning of its bread with genial pluck,\nand its good-natured humanness had touched him. He had enjoyed his talk;\nhe wanted to hear more of it. He was not in the mood to let him go his\nway. To Penzance, who was to lunch with him to-day, he would present a\nstudy of absorbing interest.\n\n\"No,\" he answered. \"I'm not an actor. My name is Mount Dunstan, and this\nplace,\" with a nod over his shoulder, \"is mine--but I'm up against it,\nnevertheless.\"\n\nSelden looked a trifle disgusted. He began to pick up his bicycle. He\nhad given a degree of natural sympathy, and this was an English chap's\nidea of a joke.\n\n\"I'm the Prince of Wales, myself,\" he remarked, \"and my mother's\nexpecting me to lunch at Windsor. So long, me lord,\" and he set his foot\non the treadle.\n\nMount Dunstan rose, feeling rather awkward. The point seemed somewhat\ndifficult to contend.\n\n\"It is not a joke,\" he said, conscious that he spoke rather stiffly.\n\n\"Little Willie's not quite as easy as he looks,\" was the cryptic remark\nof Mr. Selden.\n\nMount Dunstan lost his rather easily lost temper, which happened to be\nthe best thing he could have done under the circumstances.\n\n\"Damn it,\" he burst out. \"I'm not such a fool as I evidently look. A\nnice ass I should be to play an idiot joke like that. I'm speaking the\ntruth. Go if you like--and be hanged.\"\n\nSelden's attention was arrested. The fellow was in earnest. The place\nwas his. He must be the earl chap he had heard spoken of at the wayside\npublic house he had stopped at for a pot of beer. He dismounted from his\nbicycle, and came back, pushing it before him, good-natured relenting\nand awkwardness combining in his look.\n\n\"All right,\" he said. \"I apologise--if it's cold fact. I'm not calling\nyou a liar.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" still a little stiffly, from Mount Dunstan.\n\nThe unabashed good cheer of G. Selden carried him lightly over a\nslightly difficult moment. He laughed, pushing his cap back, of course,\nand looking over the hedge at the sweep of park, with a group of deer\ncropping softly in the foreground.\n\n\"I guess I should get a bit hot myself,\" he volunteered handsomely, \"if\nI was an earl, and owned a place like this, and a fool fellow came along\nand took me for a tramp. That was a pretty bad break, wasn't it? But I\ndid say you didn't look like it. Anyway you needn't mind me. I shouldn't\nget onto Pierpont Morgan or W. K. Vanderbilt, if I met 'em in the\nstreet.\"\n\nHe spoke the two names as an Englishman of his class would have spoken\nof the Dukes of Westminster or Marlborough. These were his nobles--the\nheads of the great American houses, and entirely parallel, in his mind,\nwith the heads of any great house in England. They wielded the power of\nthe world, and could wield it for evil or good, as any prince or duke\nmight. Mount Dunstan saw the parallel.\n\n\"I apologise, all right,\" G. Selden ended genially.\n\n\"I am not offended,\" Mount Dunstan answered. \"There was no reason why\nyou should know me from another man. I was taken for a gamekeeper a\nfew weeks since. I was savage a moment, because you refused to believe\nme--and why should you believe me after all?\"\n\nG. Selden hesitated. He liked the fellow anyhow.\n\n\"You said you were up against it--that was it. And--and I've seen chaps\ndown on their luck often enough. Good Lord, the hard-luck stories I hear\nevery day of my life. And they get a sort of look about the eyes and\nmouth. I hate to see it on any fellow. It makes me sort of sick to come\nacross it even in a chap that's only got his fool self to blame. I may\nbe making another break, telling you--but you looked sort of that way.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" stolidly, \"I did.\" Then, his voice warming,\n\n\"It was jolly good-natured of you to think about it at all. Thank you.\"\n\n\"That's all right,\" in polite acknowledgment. Then with another look\nover the hedge, \"Say--what ought I to call you? Earl, or my Lord?\"\n\n\"It's not necessary for you to call me anything in particular--as a\nrule. If you were speaking of me, you might say Lord Mount Dunstan.\"\n\nG. Selden looked relieved.\n\n\"I don't want to be too much off,\" he said. \"And I'd like to ask you\na favour. I've only three weeks here, and I don't want to miss any\nchances.\"\n\n\"What chance would you like?\"\n\n\"One of the things I'm biking over the country for, is to get a look\nat just such a place as this. We haven't got 'em in America. My old\ngrandmother was always talking about them. Before her mother brought\nher to New York she'd lived in a village near some park gates, and she\nchinned about it till she died. When I was a little chap I liked to hear\nher. She wasn't much of an American. Wore a black net cap with purple\nribbons in it, and hadn't outlived her respect for aristocracy. Gee!\"\nchuckling, \"if she'd heard what I said to you just now, I reckon she'd\nhave thrown a fit. Anyhow she made me feel I'd like to see the kind of\nplaces she talked about. And I shall think myself in luck if you'll\nlet me have a look at yours--just a bike around the park, if you don't\nobject--or I'll leave the bike outside, if you'd rather.\"\n\n\"I don't object at all,\" said Mount Dunstan. \"The fact is, I happened to\nbe on the point of asking you to come and have some lunch--when you got\non your bicycle.\"\n\nSelden pushed his cap and cleared his throat.\n\n\"I wasn't expecting that,\" he said. \"I'm pretty dusty,\" with a glance\nat his clothes. \"I need a wash and brush up--particularly if there are\nladies.\"\n\nThere were no ladies, and he could be made comfortable. This being\nexplained to him, he was obviously rejoiced. With unembarrassed\nfrankness, he expressed exultation. Such luck had not, at any time,\npresented itself to him as a possibility in his holiday scheme.\n\n\"By gee,\" he ejaculated, as they walked under the broad oaks of the\navenue leading to the house. \"Speaking of luck, this is the limit! I\ncan't help thinking of what my grandmother would say if she saw me.\"\n\nHe was a new order of companion, but before they had reached the house,\nMount Dunstan had begun to find him inspiring to the spirits.\nHis jovial, if crude youth, his unaffected acknowledgment of\nunaccustomedness to grandeur, even when in dilapidation, his delight in\nthe novelty of the particular forms of everything about him--trees and\nsward, ferns and moss, his open self-congratulation, were without doubt\ncheerful things.\n\nHis exclamation, when they came within sight of the house itself, was\nfor a moment disturbing to Mount Dunstan's composure.\n\n\"Hully gee!\" he said. \"The old lady was right. All I've thought about\n'em was 'way off. It's bigger than a museum.\" His approval was immense.\n\nDuring the absence in which he was supplied with the \"wash and brush\nup,\" Mount Dunstan found Mr. Penzance in the library. He explained to\nhim what he had encountered, and how it had attracted him.\n\n\"You have liked to hear me describe my Western neighbours,\" he said.\n\"This youngster is a New York development, and of a different type.\nBut there is a likeness. I have invited to lunch with us, a young man\nwhom--Tenham, for instance, if he were here--would call 'a bounder.'\nHe is nothing of the sort. In his junior-assistant-salesman way, he is\nrather a fine thing. I never saw anything more decently human than his\nway of asking me--man to man, making friends by the roadside if I was\n'up against it.' No other fellow I have known has ever exhibited the\nsame healthy sympathy.\"\n\nThe Reverend Lewis was entranced. Already he was really quite flushed\nwith interest. As Assyrian character, engraved upon sarcophogi, would\nhave allured and thrilled him, so was he allured by the cryptic nature\nof the two or three American slang phrases Mount Dunstan had repeated to\nhim. His was the student's simple ardour.\n\n\"Up against it,\" he echoed. \"Really! Dear! Dear! And that signifies, you\nsay----\"\n\n\"Apparently it means that a man has come face to face with an obstacle\ndifficult or impossible to overcome.\"\n\n\"But, upon my word, that is not bad. It is strong figure of speech.\nIt brings up a picture. A man hurrying to an end--much desired--comes\nunexpectedly upon a stone wall. One can almost hear the impact. He is up\nagainst it. Most vivid. Excellent! Excellent!\"\n\nThe nature of Selden's calling was such that he was not accustomed to\nbeing received with a hint of enthusiastic welcome. There was something\nalmost akin to this in the vicar's courteously amiable, aquiline\ncountenance when he rose to shake hands with the young man on his\nentrance. Mr. Penzance was indeed slightly disappointed that his\ngreeting was not responded to by some characteristic phrasing. His\nAmerican was that of Sam Slick and Artemus Ward, Punch and various\nEnglish witticisms in anecdote. Life at the vicarage of Dunstan had not\nrevealed to him that the model had become archaic.\n\nThe revelation dawned upon him during his intercourse with G. Selden.\nThe young man in his cheap bicycling suit was a new development. He was\nmarkedly unlike an English youth of his class, as he was neither shy,\nnor laboriously at his ease. That he was at his ease to quite an amazing\ndegree might perhaps have been remotely resented by the insular mind,\naccustomed to another order of bearing in its social inferiors, had it\nnot been so obviously founded on entire unconsciousness of self, and\nso mingled with open appreciation of the unanticipated pleasures of the\noccasion. Nothing could have been farther from G. Selden than any desire\nto attempt to convey the impression that he had enjoyed the hospitality\nof persons of rank on previous occasions. He found indeed a gleeful\npoint in the joke of the incongruousness of his own presence amid such\nsurroundings.\n\n\"What Little Willie was expecting,\" he remarked once, to the keen joy\nof Mr. Penzance, \"was a hunk of bread and cheese at a village saloon\nsomewhere. I ought to have said 'pub,' oughtn't I? You don't call them\nsaloons here.\"\n\nHe was encouraged to talk, and in his care-free fluency he opened up\nmany vistas to the interested Mr. Penzance, who found himself, so to\nspeak, whirled along Broadway, rushed up the steps of the elevated\nrailroad and struggling to obtain a seat, or a strap to hang to on a\nSixth Avenue train. The man was saturated with the atmosphere of the\nhot battle he lived in. From his childhood he had known nothing but\nthe fever heat of his \"little old New York,\" as he called it with\naffectionate slanginess, and any temperature lower than that he was\naccustomed to would have struck him as being below normal. Penzance was\nimpressed by his feeling of affection for the amazing city of his birth.\nHe admired, he adored it, he boasted joyously of its perfervid charm.\n\n\"Something doing,\" he said. \"That's what my sort of a fellow\nlikes--something doing. You feel it right there when you walk along\nthe streets. Little old New York for mine. It's good enough for Little\nWillie. And it never stops. Why, Broadway at night----\"\n\nHe forgot his chop, and leaned forward on the table to pour forth his\ndescription. The manservant, standing behind Mount Dunstan's chair,\nforgot himself also, thought he was a trained domestic whose duty it\nwas to present dishes to the attention without any apparent mental\nprocesses. Certainly it was not his business to listen, and gaze\nfascinated. This he did, however, actually for the time unconscious of\nhis breach of manners. The very crudity of the language used, the oddly\nsounding, sometimes not easily translatable slang phrases, used as if\nthey were a necessary part of any conversation--the blunt, uneducated\nbareness of figure--seemed to Penzance to make more roughly vivid the\npicture dashed off. The broad thoroughfare almost as thronged by night\nas by day. Crowds going to theatres, loaded electric cars, whizzing and\nclanging bells, the elevated railroad rushing and roaring past within\nhearing, theatre fronts flaming with electric light, announcements of\nnames of theatrical stars and the plays they appeared in, electric\nlight advertisements of brands of cigars, whiskies, breakfast foods, all\nblazing high in the night air in such number and with such strength of\nbrilliancy that the whole thoroughfare was as bright with light as a\nballroom or a theatre. The vicar felt himself standing in the midst of\nit all, blinded by the glare.\n\n\"Sit down on the sidewalk and read your newspaper, a book, a\nmagazine--any old thing you like,\" with an exultant laugh.\n\nThe names of the dramatic stars blazing over entrances to the theatres\nwere often English names, their plays English plays, their companies\nmade up of English men and women. G. Selden was as familiar with them\nand commented upon their gifts as easily as if he had drawn his drama\nfrom the Strand instead of from Broadway. The novels piled up in the\nstations of what he called \"the L\" (which revealed itself as being\na New-York-haste abbreviation of Elevated railroad), were in large\nproportion English novels, and he had his ingenuous estimate of English\nnovelists, as well as of all else.\n\n\"Ruddy, now,\" he said; \"I like him. He's all right, even though we\nhaven't quite caught onto India yet.\"\n\nThe dazzle and brilliancy of Broadway so surrounded Penzance that he\nfound it necessary to withdraw himself and return to his immediate\nsurroundings, that he might recover from his sense of interested\nbewilderment. His eyes fell upon the stern lineaments of a Mount Dunstan\nin a costume of the time of Henry VIII. He was a burly gentleman,\nwhose ruff-shortened thick neck and haughty fixedness of stare from the\nbackground of his portrait were such as seemed to eliminate him from the\nscheme of things, the clanging of electric cars, and the prevailing\nroar of the L. Confronted by his gaze, electric light advertisements of\nwhiskies, cigars, and corsets seemed impossible.\n\n\"He's all right,\" continued G. Selden. \"I'm ready to separate myself\nfrom one fifty any time I see a new book of his. He's got the goods with\nhim.\"\n\nThe richness of colloquialism moved the vicar of Mount Dunstan to deep\nenjoyment.\n\n\"Would you mind--I trust you won't,\" he apologised courteously, \"telling\nme exactly the significance of those two last sentences. In think I see\ntheir meaning, but----\"\n\nG. Selden looked good-naturedly apologetic himself.\n\n\"Well, it's slang--you see,\" he explained. \"I guess I can't help it.\nYou--\" flushing a trifle, but without any touch of resentment in the\nboyish colour, \"you know what sort of a chap I am. I'm not passing\nmyself off as anything but an ordinary business hustler, am I--just\nunder salesman to a typewriter concern? I shouldn't like to think I'd\ngot in here on any bluff. I guess I sling in slang every half dozen\nwords----.\"\n\n\"My dear boy,\" Penzance was absolutely moved and he spoke with\nwarmth quite paternal, \"Lord Mount Dunstan and I are genuinely\ninterested--genuinely. He, because he knows New York a little, and I\nbecause I don't. I am an elderly man, and have spent my life buried\nin my books in drowsy villages. Pray go on. Your American slang has\nfrequently a delightful meaning--a fantastic hilarity, or common sense,\nor philosophy, hidden in its origin. In that it generally differs from\nEnglish slang, which--I regret to say--is usually founded on some silly\ncatch word. Pray go on. When you see a new book by Mr. Kipling, you are\nready to 'separate yourself from one fifty' because he 'has the goods\nwith him.'\"\n\nG. Selden suppressed an involuntary young laugh.\n\n\"One dollar and fifty cents is usually the price of a book,\" he said.\n\"You separate yourself from it when you take it out of your clothes--I\nmean out of your pocket--and pay it over the counter.\"\n\n\"There's a careless humour in it,\" said Mount Dunstan grimly. \"The\nsuggestion of parting is not half bad. On the whole, it is subtle.\"\n\n\"A great deal of it is subtle,\" said Penzance, \"though it all professes\nto be obvious. The other sentence has a commercial sound.\"\n\n\"When a man goes about selling for a concern,\" said the junior assistant\nof Jones, \"he can prove what he says, if he has the goods with him. I\nguess it came from that. I don't know. I only know that when a man is a\nstraight sort of fellow, and can show up, we say he's got the goods with\nhim.\"\n\nThey sat after lunch in the library, before an open window, looking into\na lovely sunken garden. Blossoms were breaking out on every side, and\nrobins, thrushes, and blackbirds chirped and trilled and whistled, as\nMount Dunstan and Penzance led G. Selden on to paint further pictures\nfor them.\n\nSome of them were rather painful, Penzance thought. As connected with\nyouth, they held a touch of pathos Selden was all unconscious of. He had\nhad a hard life, made up, since his tenth year, of struggles to earn his\nliving. He had sold newspapers, he had run errands, he had swept out a\n\"candy store.\" He had had a few years at the public school, and a few\nmonths at a business college, to which he went at night, after work\nhours. He had been \"up against it good and plenty,\" he told them. He\nseemed, however, to have had a knack of making friends and of giving\nthem \"a boost along\" when such a chance was possible. Both of his\nlisteners realised that a good many people had liked him, and the reason\nwas apparent enough to them.\n\n\"When a chap gets sorry for himself,\" he remarked once, \"he's down and\nout. That's a stone-cold fact. There's lots of hard-luck stories that\nyou've got to hear anyhow. The fellow that can keep his to himself is\nthe fellow that's likely to get there.\"\n\n\"Get there?\" the vicar murmured reflectively, and Selden chuckled again.\n\n\"Get where he started out to go to--the White House, if you like. The\nfellows that have got there kept their hardluck stories quiet, I bet.\nGuess most of 'em had plenty during election, if they were the kind to\nlie awake sobbing on their pillows because their feelings were hurt.\"\n\nHe had never been sorry for himself, it was evident, though it must be\nadmitted that there were moments when the elderly English clergyman,\nwhose most serious encounters had been annoying interviews with\ncottagers of disrespectful manner, rather shuddered as he heard his\nsimple recital of days when he had tramped street after street, carrying\nhis catalogue with him, and trying to tell his story of the Delkoff to\nfrantically busy men who were driven mad by the importunate sight of\nhim, to worried, ill-tempered ones who broke into fury when they heard\nhis voice, and to savage brutes who were only restrained by law from\nkicking him into the street.\n\n\"You've got to take it, if you don't want to lose your job. Some of\nthem's as tired as you are. Sometimes, if you can give 'em a jolly and\nmake 'em laugh, they'll listen, and you may unload a machine. But it's\nno merry jest just at first--particularly in bad weather. The first five\nweeks I was with the Delkoff I never made a sale. Had to live on my ten\nper, and that's pretty hard in New York. Three and a half for your\nhall bedroom, and the rest for your hash and shoes. But I held on, and\ngradually luck began to turn, and I began not to care so much when a man\ngave it to me hot.\"\n\nThe vicar of Mount Dunstan had never heard of the \"hall bedroom\" as an\ninstitution. A dozen unconscious sentences placed it before his mental\nvision. He thought it horribly touching. A narrow room at the back of\na cheap lodging house, a bed, a strip of carpet, a washstand--this the\nsole refuge of a male human creature, in the flood tide of youth, no\nmore than this to come back to nightly, footsore and resentful of soul,\nafter a day's tramp spent in forcing himself and his wares on people\nwho did not want him or them, and who found infinite variety in the\nforcefulness of their method of saying so.\n\n\"What you know, when you go into a place, is that nobody wants to see\nyou, and no one will let you talk if they can help it. The only thing is\nto get in and rattle off your stunt before you can be fired out.\"\n\nSometimes at first he had gone back at night to the hall bedroom, and\nsat on the edge of the narrow bed, swinging his feet, and asking himself\nhow long he could hold out. But he had held out, and evidently developed\ninto a good salesman, being bold and of imperturbable good spirits and\ntemper, and not troubled by hypersensitiveness. Hearing of the \"hall\nbedroom,\" the coldness of it in winter, and the breathless heat in\nsummer, the utter loneliness of it at all times and seasons, one could\nnot have felt surprise if the grown-up lad doomed to its narrowness as\nhome had been drawn into the electric-lighted gaiety of Broadway, and\nbeing caught in its maelstrom, had been sucked under to its lowest\ndepths. But it was to be observed that G. Selden had a clear eye, and a\nhealthy skin, and a healthy young laugh yet, which were all wonderfully\nto his credit, and added enormously to one's liking for him.\n\n\"Do you use a typewriter?\" he said at last to Mr. Penzance. \"It would\ncut out half your work with your sermons. If you do use one, I'd just\nlike to call your attention to the Delkoff. It's the most up-to-date\nmachine on the market to-day,\" drawing out the catalogue.\n\n\"I do not use one, and I am extremely sorry to say that I could not\nafford to buy one,\" said Mr. Penzance with considerate courtesy, \"but do\ntell me about it. I am afraid I never saw a typewriter.\"\n\nIt was the most hospitable thing he could have done, and was of the tact\nof courts. He arranged his pince nez, and taking the catalogue, applied\nhimself to it. G. Selden's soul warmed within him. To be listened to\nlike this. To be treated as a gentleman by a gentleman--by \"a fine old\nswell like this--Hully gee!\"\n\n\"This isn't what I'm used to,\" he said with genuine enjoyment. \"It\ndoesn't matter, your not being ready to buy now. You may be sometime, or\nyou may run up against someone who is. Little Willie's always ready to\nsay his piece.\"\n\nHe poured it forth with glee--the improved mechanical appliances,\nthe cuts in the catalogue, the platen roller, the ribbon switch, the\ntwenty-six yards of red or blue typing, the fifty per cent. saving in\nribbon expenditure alone, the new basket shift, the stationary carriage,\nthe tabulator, the superiority to all other typewriting machines--the\nprice one hundred dollars without discount. And both Mount Dunstan and\nMr. Penzance listened entranced, examined cuts in the catalogue, asked\nquestions, and in fact ended by finding that they must repress an actual\ndesire to possess the luxury. The joy their attitude bestowed upon\nSelden was the thing he would feel gave the finishing touch to the hours\nwhich he would recall to the end of his days as the \"time of his life.\"\nYes, by gee! he was having \"the time of his life.\"\n\nLater he found himself feeling--as Miss Vanderpoel had felt--rather\nas if the whole thing was a dream. This came upon him when, with Mount\nDunstan and Penzance, he walked through the park and the curiously\nbeautiful old gardens. The lovely, soundless quiet, broken into only by\nbird notes, or his companions' voices, had an extraordinary effect on\nhim.\n\n\"It's so still you can hear it,\" he said once, stopping in a velvet,\nmoss-covered path. \"Seems like you've got quiet shut up here, and you've\nturned it on till the air's thick with it. Good Lord, think of little\nold Broadway keeping it up, and the L whizzing and thundering along\nevery three minutes, just the same, while we're standing here! You can't\nbelieve it.\"\n\nIt would have gone hard with him to describe to them the value of his\nenjoyment. Again and again there came back to him the memory of the\ngrandmother who wore the black net cap trimmed with purple ribbons.\nApparently she had remained to the last almost contumaciously British.\nShe had kept photographs of Queen Victoria and the Prince Consort on her\nbedroom mantelpiece, and had made caustic, international comparisons.\nBut she had seen places like this, and her stories became realities to\nhim now. But she had never thought of the possibility of any chance of\nhis being shown about by the lord of the manor himself--lunching, by\ngee! and talking to them about typewriters. He vaguely knew that if the\ngrandmother had not emigrated, and he had been born in Dunstan village,\nhe would naturally have touched his forehead to Mount Dunstan and the\nvicar when they passed him in the road, and conversation between them\nwould have been an unlikely thing. Somehow things had been changed by\nDestiny--perhaps for the whole of them, as years had passed.\n\nWhat he felt when he stood in the picture gallery neither of his\ncompanions could at first guess. He ceased to talk, and wandered\nsilently about. Secretly he found himself a trifle awed by being looked\ndown upon by the unchanging eyes of men in strange, rich garments--in\ncorslet, ruff, and doublet, velvet, powder, curled love locks, brocade\nand lace. The face of long-dead loveliness smiled out from its canvas,\nor withheld itself haughtily from his salesman's gaze. Wonderful bare\nwhite shoulders, and bosoms clasped with gems or flowers and lace,\ndefied him to recall any treasures of Broadway to compare with them.\nElderly dames, garbed in stiff splendour, held stiff, unsympathetic\ninquiry in their eyes, as they looked back upon him. What exactly was a\nthirty shilling bicycle suit doing there? In the Delkoff, plainly none\nwere interested. A pretty, masquerading shepherdess, with a lamb and a\ncrook, seemed to laugh at him from under her broad beribboned straw\nhat. After looking at her for a minute or so, he gave a half laugh\nhimself--but it was an awkward one.\n\n\"She's a looker,\" he remarked. \"They're a lot of them lookers--not\nall--but a fair show----\"\n\n\"A looker,\" translated Mount Dunstan in a low voice to Penzance, \"means,\nI believe, a young women with good looks--a beauty.\"\n\n\"Yes, she IS a looker, by gee,\" said G. Selden, \"but--but--\" the awkward\nhalf laugh, taking on a depressed touch of sheepishness, \"she makes me\nfeel 'way off--they all do.\"\n\nThat was it. Surrounded by them, he was fascinated but not cheered. They\nwere all so smilingly, or disdainfully, or indifferently unconscious of\nthe existence of the human thing of his class. His aspect, his life, and\nhis desires were as remote as those of prehistoric man. His Broadway,\nhis L railroad, his Delkoff--what were they where did they come into\nthe scheme of the Universe? They silently gazed and lightly smiled or\nfrowned THROUGH him as he stood. He was probably not in the least aware\nthat he rather loudly sighed.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"they make me feel 'way off. I'm not in it. But she is a\nlooker. Get onto that dimple in her cheek.\"\n\nMount Dunstan and Penzance spent the afternoon in doing their best for\nhim. He was well worth it. Mr. Penzance was filled with delight, and\nsaturated with the atmosphere of New York.\n\n\"I feel,\" he said, softly polishing his eyeglasses and almost\naffectionately smiling, \"I really feel as if I had been walking down\nBroadway or Fifth Avenue. I believe that I might find my way to--well,\nsuppose we say Weber & Field's,\" and G. Selden shouted with glee.\n\nNever before, in fact, had he felt his heart so warmed by spontaneous\naffection as it was by this elderly, somewhat bald and thin-faced\nclergyman of the Church of England. This he had never seen before.\nWithout the trained subtlety to have explained to himself the finely\nsweet and simply gracious deeps of it, he was moved and uplifted. He was\nglad he had \"come across\" it, he felt a vague regret at passing on his\nway, and leaving it behind. He would have liked to feel that perhaps he\nmight come back. He would have liked to present him with a Delkoff, and\nteach him how to run it. He had delighted in Mount Dunstan, and rejoiced\nin him, but he had rather fallen in love with Penzance. Certain American\ndoubts he had had of the solidity and permanency of England's position\nand power were somewhat modified. When fellows like these two stood at\nthe first rank, little old England was a pretty safe proposition.\n\nAfter they had given him tea among the scents and songs of the sunken\ngarden outside the library window, they set him on his way. The shadows\nwere lengthening and the sunlight falling in deepening gold when they\nwalked up the avenue and shook hands with him at the big entrance gates.\n\n\"Well, gentlemen,\" he said, \"you've treated me grand--as fine as silk,\nand it won't be like Little Willie to forget it. When I go back to\nNew York it'll be all I can do to keep from getting the swell head and\nbragging about it. I've enjoyed myself down to the ground, every minute.\nI'm not the kind of fellow to be likely to be able to pay you back\nyour kindness, but, hully gee! if I could I'd do it to beat the band.\nGood-bye, gentlemen--and thank you--thank you.\"\n\nAcross which one of their minds passed the thought that the sound of the\nhollow impact of a trotting horse's hoofs on the road, which each that\nmoment became conscious of hearing was the sound of the advancing foot\nof Fate? It crossed no mind among the three. There was no reason why\nit should. And yet at that moment the meaning of the regular, stirring\nsound was a fateful thing.\n\n\"Someone on horseback,\" said Penzance.\n\nHe had scarcely spoken before round the curve of the road she came. A\nfinely slender and spiritedly erect girl's figure, upon a satin-skinned\nbright chestnut with a thoroughbred gait, a smart groom riding behind\nher. She came towards them, was abreast them, looked at Mount Dunstan, a\nsmiling dimple near her lip as she returned his quick salute.\n\n\"Miss Vanderpoel,\" he said low to the vicar, \"Lady Anstruther's sister.\"\n\nMr. Penzance, replacing his own hat, looked after her with surprised\npleasure.\n\n\"Really,\" he exclaimed, \"Miss Vanderpoel! What a fine girl! How\nunusually handsome!\"\n\nSelden turned with a gasp of delighted, amazed recognition.\n\n\"Miss Vanderpoel,\" he burst forth, \"Reuben Vanderpoel's daughter! The\none that's over here visiting her sister. Is it that one--sure?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" from Mount Dunstan without fervour. \"Lady Anstruthers lives at\nStornham, about six miles from here.\"\n\n\"Gee,\" with feverish regret. \"If her father was there, and I could get\nnext to him, my fortune would be made.\"\n\n\"Should you,\" ventured Penzance politely, \"endeavour to sell him a\ntypewriter?\"\n\n\"A typewriter! Holy smoke! I'd try to sell him ten thousand. A fellow\nlike that syndicates the world. If I could get next to him----\" and he\nmounted his bicycle with a laugh.\n\n\"Get next,\" murmured Penzance.\n\n\"Get on the good side of him,\" Mount Dunstan murmured in reply.\n\n\"So long, gentlemen, good-bye, and thank you again,\" called G. Selden as\nhe wheeled off, and was carried soundlessly down the golden road.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nTHE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF STORNHAM\n\nThe satin-skinned chestnut was one of the new horses now standing in\nthe Stornham stables. There were several of them--a pair for the landau,\nsaddle horses, smart young cobs for phaeton or dog cart, a pony for\nUghtred--the animals necessary at such a place at Stornham. The stables\nthemselves had been quickly put in order, grooms and stable boys kept\nthem as they had not been kept for years. The men learned in a week's\ntime that their work could not be done too well. There were new\ncarriages as well as horses. They had come from London after Lady\nAnstruthers and her sister returned from town. The horses had been\nbrought down by their grooms--immensely looked after, blanketed, hooded,\nand altogether cared for as if they were visiting dukes and duchesses.\nThey were all fine, handsome, carefully chosen creatures. When they\ndanced and sidled through the village on their way to the Court, they\ncreated a sensation. Whosoever had chosen them had known his business.\nThe older vehicles had been repaired in the village by Tread, and did\nhim credit. Fox had also done his work well.\n\nPlenty more of it had come into their work-shops. Tools to be used on\nthe estate, garden implements, wheelbarrows, lawn rollers, things needed\nabout the house, stables, and cottages, were to be attended to. The\nchurch roof was being repaired. Taking all these things and the \"doing\nup\" of the Court itself, there was more work than the village could\nmanage, and carpenters, bricklayers, and decorators were necessarily\nbrought from other places. Still Joe Buttle and Sim Soames were allowed\nto lead in all such things as lay within their capabilities. It was they\nwho made such a splendid job of the entrance gates and the lodges. It\nwas astonishing how much was done, and how the sense of life in the\nair--the work of resulting prosperity, made men begin to tread with less\nlistless steps as they went to and from their labour. In the cottages\nthings were being done which made downcast women bestir themselves and\nlook less slatternly. Leaks mended here, windows there, the hopeless\ncopper in the tiny washhouse replaced by a new one, chimneys cured of\nthe habit of smoking, a clean, flowered paper put on a wall, a coat of\nwhitewash--they were small matters, but produced great effect.\n\nBetty had begun to drop into the cottages, and make the acquaintance\nof their owners. Her first visits, she observed, created great\nconsternation. Women looked frightened or sullen, children stared\nand refused to speak, clinging to skirts and aprons. She found the\natmosphere clear after her second visit. The women began to talk, and\nthe children collected in groups and listened with cheerful grins.\nShe could pick up little Jane's kitten, or give a pat to small Thomas'\nmongrel dog, in a manner which threw down barriers.\n\n\"Don't put out your pipe,\" she said to old Grandfather Doby, rising\ntotteringly respectful from his chimney-side chair. \"You have only just\nlighted it. You mustn't waste a whole pipeful of tobacco because I have\ncome in.\"\n\nThe old man, grown childish with age, tittered and shuffled and giggled.\nSuch a joke as the grand young lady was having with him. She saw he had\nonly just lighted his pipe. The gentry joked a bit sometimes. But he was\nafraid of his grandson's wife, who was frowning and shaking her head.\n\nBetty went to him, and put her hand on his arm.\n\n\"Sit down,\" she said, \"and I will sit by you.\" And she sat down and\nshowed him that she had brought a package of tobacco with her, and\nactually a wonder of a red and yellow jar to hold it, at the sight of\nwhich unheard-of joys his rapture was so great that his trembling hands\ncould scarcely clasp his treasures.\n\n\"Tee-hee! Tee-hee-ee! Deary me! Thankee--thankee, my lady,\" he tittered,\nand he gazed and blinked at her beauty through heavenly tears.\n\n\"Nearly a hundred years old, and he has lived on sixteen shillings a\nweek all his life, and earned it by working every hour between sunrise\nand sunset,\" Betty said to her sister, when she went home. \"A man has\none life, and his has passed like that. It is done now, and all the\nyears and work have left nothing in his old hands but his pipe. That's\nall. I should not like to put it out for him. Who am I that I can buy\nhim a new one, and keep it filled for him until the end? How did it\nhappen? No,\" suddenly, \"I must not lose time in asking myself that. I\nmust get the new pipe.\"\n\nShe did it--a pipe of great magnificence--such as drew to the Doby\ncottage as many callers as the village could provide, each coming with\nfevered interest, to look at it--to be allowed to hold and examine it\nfor a few moments, guessing at its probable enormous cost, and returning\nit reverently, to gaze at Doby with respect--the increase of which can\nbe imagined when it was known that he was not only possessor of the\npipe, but of an assurance that he would be supplied with as much tobacco\nas he could use, to the end of his days. From the time of the advent\nof the pipe, Grandfather Doby became a man of mark, and his life in the\nchimney corner a changed thing. A man who owns splendours and unlimited,\nexcellent shag may like friends to drop in and crack jokes--and even\nsmoke a pipe with him--a common pipe, which, however, is not amiss when\nexcellent shag comes free.\n\n\"He lives in a wild whirl of gaiety--a social vortex,\" said Betty to\nLady Anstruthers, after one of her visits. \"He is actually rejuvenated.\nI must order some new white smocks for him to receive his visitors in.\nSomeone brought him an old copy of the Illustrated London News last\nnight. We will send him illustrated papers every week.\"\n\nIn the dull old brain, God knows what spark of life had been relighted.\nYoung Mrs. Doby related with chuckles that granddad had begged that his\nchair might be dragged to the window, that he might sit and watch the\nvillage street. Sitting there, day after day, he smoked and looked at\nhis pictures, and dozed and dreamed, his pipe and tobacco jar beside\nhim on the window ledge. At any sound of wheels or footsteps his face\nlighted, and if, by chance, he caught a glimpse of Betty, he tottered\nto his feet, and stood hurriedly touching his bald forehead with a\nreverent, palsied hand.\n\n\"'Tis 'urr,\" he would say, enrapt. \"I seen 'urr--I did.\" And young Mrs.\nDoby knew that this was his joy, and what he waited for as one waits for\nthe coming of the sun.\n\n\"'Tis 'urr! 'Tis 'urr!\"\n\nThe vicar's wife, Mrs. Brent, who since the affair of John Wilson's fire\nhad dropped into the background and felt it indiscreet to present tales\nof distress at the Court, began to recover her courage. Her perfunctory\nvisits assumed a new character. The vicarage had, of course, called\npromptly upon Miss Vanderpoel, after her arrival. Mrs. Brent admired\nMiss Vanderpoel hugely.\n\n\"You seem so unlike an American,\" she said once in her most tactful,\ningratiating manner--which was very ingratiating indeed.\n\n\"Do I? What is one like when one is like an American? I am one, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"I can scarcely believe it,\" with sweet ardour.\n\n\"Pray try,\" said Betty with simple brevity, and Mrs. Brent felt that\nperhaps Miss Vanderpoel was not really very easy to get on with.\n\n\"She meant to imply that I did not speak through my nose, and talk too\nmuch, and too vivaciously, in a shrill voice,\" Betty said afterwards, in\ntalking the interview over with Rosy. \"I like to convince myself that\nis not one's sole national characteristic. Also it was not exactly Mrs.\nBrent's place to kindly encourage me with the information that I do not\nseem to belong to my own country.\"\n\nLady Anstruthers laughed, and Betty looked at her inquiringly.\n\n\"You said that just like--just like an Englishwoman.\"\n\n\"Did I?\" said Betty.\n\nMrs. Brent had come to talk to her because she did not wish to trouble\ndear Lady Anstruthers. Lady Anstruthers already looked much stronger,\nbut she had been delicate so long that one hesitated to distress her\nwith village matters. She did not add that she realised that she was\ncoming to headquarters. The vicar and herself were much disturbed\nabout a rather tiresome old woman--old Mrs. Welden--who lived in a\ntiny cottage in the village. She was eighty-three years old, and a\nrespectable old person--a widow, who had reared ten children. The\nchildren had all grown up, and scattered, and old Mrs. Welden had\nnothing whatever to live on. No one knew how she lived, and really\nshe would be better off in the workhouse. She could be sent to Brexley\nUnion, and comfortably taken care of, but she had that singular,\nobstinate dislike to going, which it was so difficult to manage. She\nhad asked for a shilling a week from the parish, but that could not be\nallowed her, as it would merely uphold her in her obstinate intention\nof remaining in her cottage, and taking care of herself--which she could\nnot do. Betty gathered that the shilling a week would be a drain on the\nparish funds, and would so raise the old creature to affluence that she\nwould feel she could defy fate. And the contumacity of old men and women\nshould not be strengthened by the reckless bestowal of shillings.\n\nKnowing that Miss Vanderpoel had already gained influence among the\nvillage people, Mrs. Brent said, she had come to ask her if she would\nsee old Mrs. Welden and argue with her in such a manner as would\nconvince her that the workhouse was the best place for her. It was, of\ncourse, so much pleasanter if these old people could be induced to go to\nBrexley willingly.\n\n\"Shall I be undermining the whole Political Economy of Stornham if I\ntake care of her myself?\" suggested Betty.\n\n\"You--you will lead others to expect the same thing will be done for\nthem.\"\n\n\"When one has resources to draw on,\" Miss Vanderpoel commented, \"in\nthe case of a woman who has lived eighty-three years and brought up ten\nchildren until they were old and strong enough to leave her to take care\nof herself, it is difficult for the weak of mind to apply the laws of\nPolitical Economics. I will go and see old Mrs. Welden.\"\n\nIf the Vanderpoels would provide for all the obstinate old men and women\nin the parish, the Political Economics of Stornham would proffer no\nmarked objections. \"A good many Americans,\" Mrs. Brent reflected,\n\"seemed to have those odd, lavish ways,\" as witness Lady Anstruthers\nherself, on her first introduction to village life. Miss Vanderpoel was\nevidently a much stronger character, and extremely clever, and somehow\nthe stream of the American fortune was at last being directed towards\nStornham--which, of course, should have happened long ago. A good deal\nwas \"being done,\" and the whole situation looked more promising. So was\nthe matter discussed and summed up, the same evening after dinner, at\nthe vicarage.\n\nBetty found old Mrs. Welden's cottage. It was in a green lane, turning\nfrom the village street--which was almost a green lane itself. A tiny\nhedged-in front garden was before the cottage door. A crazy-looking\nwicket gate was in the hedge, and a fuschia bush and a few old roses\nwere in the few yards of garden. There were actually two or three\ngeraniums in the window, showing cheerful scarlet between the short,\nwhite dimity curtains.\n\n\"A house this size and of this poverty in an American village,\" was\nBetty's thought, \"would be a bare and straggling hideousness, with old\ntomato cans in the front yard. Here is one of the things we have to\nlearn from them.\"\n\nWhen she knocked at the door an old woman opened it. She was a\nwell-preserved and markedly respectable old person, in a decent print\nfrock and a cap. At the sight of her visitor she beamed and made a\nsuggestion of curtsey.\n\n\"How do you do, Mrs. Welden?\" said Betty. \"I am Lady Anstruthers'\nsister, Miss Vanderpoel. I thought I would like to come and see you.\"\n\n\"Thank you, miss, I am obliged for the kindness, miss. Won't you come in\nand have a chair?\"\n\nThere were no signs of decrepitude about her, and she had a cheery\nold eye. The tiny front room was neat, though there was scarcely space\nenough in it to contain the table covered with its blue-checked cotton\ncloth, the narrow sofa, and two or three chairs. There were a few small\ncoloured prints, and a framed photograph or so on the walls, and on the\ntable was a Bible, and a brown earthenware teapot, and a plate.\n\n\"Tom Wood's wife, that's neighbour next door to me,\" she said, \"gave me\na pinch o' tea--an' I've just been 'avin it. Tom Woods, miss, 'as just\nbeen took on by Muster Kedgers as one of the new under gardeners at the\nCourt.\"\n\nBetty found her delightful. She made no complaints, and was evidently\npleased with the excitement of receiving a visitor. The truth was, that\nin common with every other old woman, she had secretly aspired to being\nvisited some day by the amazing young lady from \"Meriker.\" Betty had yet\nto learn of the heartburnings which may be occasioned by an unconscious\nfavouritism. She was not aware that when she dropped in to talk to old\nDoby, his neighbour, old Megworth, peered from behind his curtains, with\nthe dew of envy in his rheumy eyes.\n\n\"S'ems,\" he mumbled, \"as if they wasn't nobody now in Stornham village\nbut Gaarge Doby--s'ems not.\" They were very fierce in their jealousy\nof attention, and one must beware of rousing evil passions in the\noctogenarian breast.\n\nThe young lady from \"Meriker\" had not so far had time to make a call at\nany cottage in old Mrs. Welden's lane--and she had knocked just at old\nMrs. Welden's door. This was enough to put in good spirits even a less\ncheery old person.\n\nAt first Betty wondered how she could with delicacy ask personal\nquestions. A few minutes' conversation, however, showed her that the\npersonal affairs of Sir Nigel's tenants were also the affairs of not\nonly himself, but of such of his relatives as attended to their natural\nduty. Her presence in the cottage, and her interest in Mrs. Welden's\nready flow of simple talk, were desirable and proper compliments to the\nold woman herself. She was a decent and self-respecting old person, but\nin her mind there was no faintest glimmer of resentment of questions\nconcerning rent and food and the needs of her simple, hard-driven\nexistence. She had answered such questions on many occasions, when they\nhad not been asked in the manner in which her ladyship's sister asked\nthem. Mrs. Brent had scolded her and \"poked about\" her cottage, going\ninto her tiny \"wash 'us,\" and up into her infinitesimal bedroom under\nthe slanting roof, to see that they were kept clean. Miss Vanderpoel\nshowed no disposition to \"poke.\" She sat and listened, and made an\ninquiry here and there, in a nice voice and with a smile in her\neyes. There was some pleasure in relating the whole history of your\neighty-three years to a young lady who listened as if she wanted to hear\nit. So old Mrs. Welden prattled on. About her good days, when she was\nyoung, and was kitchenmaid at the parsonage in a village twenty miles\naway; about her marriage with a young farm labourer; about his \"steady\"\nhabits, and the comfort they had together, in spite of the yearly\narrival of a new baby, and the crowding of the bit of a cottage his\nmaster allowed them. Ten of 'em, and it had been \"up before sunrise, and\na good bit of hard work to keep them all fed and clean.\" But she had not\nminded that until Jack died quite sudden after a sunstroke. It was odd\nhow much colour her rustic phraseology held. She made Betty see it all.\nThe apparent natural inevitableness of their being turned out of the\ncottage, because another man must have it; the years during which\nshe worked her way while the ten were growing up, having measles, and\nchicken pox, and scarlet fever, one dying here and there, dropping out\nquite in the natural order of things, and being buried by the parish in\ncorners of the ancient church yard. Three of them \"was took\" by scarlet\nfever, then one of a \"decline,\" then one or two by other illnesses. Only\nfour reached man and womanhood. One had gone to Australia, but he never\nwas one to write, and after a year or two, Betty gathered, he had seemed\nto melt away into the great distance. Two girls had married, and Mrs.\nWelden could not say they had been \"comf'able.\" They could barely feed\nthemselves and their swarms of children. The other son had never been\nsteady like his father. He had at last gone to London, and London had\nswallowed him up. Betty was struck by the fact that she did not seem\nto feel that the mother of ten might have expected some return for her\nlabours, at eighty-three.\n\nHer unresentful acceptance of things was at once significant and\nmoving. Betty found her amazing. What she lived on it was not easy to\nunderstand. She seemed rather like a cheerful old bird, getting up each\nunprovided-for morning, and picking up her sustenance where she found\nit.\n\n\"There's more in the sayin' 'the Lord pervides' than a good many\nthinks,\" she said with a small chuckle, marked more by a genial and\ncomfortable sense of humour than by an air of meritoriously quoting the\nvicar. \"He DO.\"\n\nShe paid one and threepence a week in rent for her cottage, and this\nwas the most serious drain upon her resources. She apparently could live\nwithout food or fire, but the rent must be paid. \"An' I do get a bit\nbe'ind sometimes,\" she confessed apologetically, \"an' then it's a\ntrouble to get straight.\"\n\nHer cottage was one of a short row, and she did odd jobs for the women\nwho were her neighbours. There were always babies to be looked after,\nand \"bits of 'elp\" needed, sometimes there were \"movings\" from one\ncottage to another, and \"confinements\" were plainly at once exhilarating\nand enriching. Her temperamental good cheer, combined with her\nexperience, made her a desirable companion and assistant. She was\nengagingly frank.\n\n\"When they're new to it, an' a bit frightened, I just give 'em a cup\nof 'ot tea, an' joke with 'em to cheer 'em up,\" she said. \"I says to\nCharles Jenkins' wife, as lives next door, 'come now, me girl, it's been\ngoin' on since Adam an' Eve, an' there's a good many of us left, isn't\nthere?' An' a fine boy it was, too, miss, an' 'er up an' about before\n'er month.\"\n\nShe was paid in sixpences and spare shillings, and in cups of tea, or a\nfresh-baked loaf, or screws of sugar, or even in a garment not yet worn\nbeyond repair. And she was free to run in and out, and grow a flower or\nso in her garden, and talk with a neighbour over the low dividing hedge.\n\n\"They want me to go into the 'Ouse,'\" reaching the dangerous subject at\nlast. \"They say I'll be took care of an' looked after. But I don't want\nto do it, miss. I want to keep my bit of a 'ome if I can, an' be free to\ncome an' go. I'm eighty-three, an' it won't be long. I 'ad a shilling a\nweek from the parish, but they stopped it because they said I ought to\ngo into the 'Ouse.'\"\n\nShe looked at Betty with a momentarily anxious smile.\n\n\"P'raps you don't quite understand, miss,\" she said. \"It'll seem like\nnothin' to you--a place like this.\"\n\n\"It doesn't,\" Betty answered, smiling bravely back into the old eyes,\nthough she felt a slight fulness of the throat. \"I understand all about\nit.\"\n\nIt is possible that old Mrs. Welden was a little taken aback by an\nattitude which, satisfactory to her own prejudices though it might be,\nwas, taken in connection with fixed customs, a trifle unnatural.\n\n\"You don't mind me not wantin' to go?\" she said.\n\n\"No,\" was the answer, \"not at all.\"\n\nBetty began to ask questions. How much tea, sugar, soap, candles, bread,\nbutter, bacon, could Mrs. Welden use in a week? It was not very easy to\nfind out the exact quantities, as Mrs. Welden's estimates of such things\nhad been based, during her entire existence, upon calculation as to how\nlittle, not how much she could use.\n\nWhen Betty suggested a pound of tea, a half pound--the old woman smiled\nat the innocent ignorance the suggestion of such reckless profusion\nimplied.\n\n\"Oh, no! Bless you, miss, no! I couldn't never do away with it. A\nquarter, miss--that'd be plenty--a quarter.\"\n\nMrs. Welden's idea of \"the best,\" was that at two shillings a pound.\nQuarter of a pound would cost sixpence (twelve cents, thought Betty).\nA pound of sugar would be twopence, Mrs. Welden would use half a pound\n(the riotous extravagance of two cents). Half a pound of butter, \"Good\ntub butter, miss,\" would be ten pence three farthings a pound. Soap,\ncandles, bacon, bread, coal, wood, in the quantities required by Mrs.\nWelden, might, with the addition of rent, amount to the dizzying height\nof eight or ten shillings.\n\n\"With careful extravagance,\" Betty mentally summed up, \"I might spend\nalmost two dollars a week in surrounding her with a riot of luxury.\"\n\nShe made a list of the things, and added some extras as an idea of her\nown. Life had not afforded her this kind of thing before, she realised.\nShe felt for the first time the joy of reckless extravagance, and\nthrilled with the excitement of it.\n\n\"You need not think of Brexley Union any more,\" she said, when she,\nhaving risen to go, stood at the cottage door with old Mrs. Welden.\n\"The things I have written down here shall be sent to you every Saturday\nnight. I will pay your rent.\"\n\n\"Miss--miss!\" Mrs. Welden looked affrighted. \"It's too much, miss. An'\ncoals eighteen pence a hundred!\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" said her ladyship's sister, and the old woman, looking up\ninto her eyes, found there the colour Mount Dunstan had thought of as\nbeing that of bluebells under water. \"I think we can manage it, Mrs.\nWelden. Keep yourself as warm as you like, and sometime I will come and\nhave a cup of tea with you and see if the tea is good.\"\n\n\"Oh! Deary me!\" said Mrs. Welden. \"I can't think what to say, miss. It\nlifts everythin'--everythin'. It's not to be believed. It's like bein'\nleft a fortune.\"\n\nWhen the wicket gate swung to and the young lady went up the lane, the\nold woman stood staring after her. And here was a piece of news to run\ninto Charley Jenkins' cottage and tell--and what woman or man in the row\nwould quite believe it?\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\n\"WE BEGAN TO MARRY THEM, MY GOOD FELLOW!\"\n\nLord Dunholm and his eldest son, Lord Westholt, sauntered together\nsmoking their after-dinner cigars on the broad-turfed terrace\noverlooking park and gardens which seemed to sweep without boundary\nline into the purplish land beyond. The grey mass of the castle stood\nclear-cut against the blue of a sky whose twilight was still almost\ndaylight, though in the purity of its evening stillness a star already\nhung, here and there, and a young moon swung low. The great spaces about\nthem held a silence whose exquisite entirety was marked at intervals\nby the distant bark of a shepherd dog driving his master's sheep to\nthe fold, their soft, intermittent plaints--the mother ewes' mellow\nanswering to the tender, fretful lambs--floated on the air, a lovely\npart of the ending day's repose. Where two who are friends stroll\ntogether at such hours, the great beauty makes for silence or for\nthoughtful talk. These two men--father and son--were friends and\nintimates, and had been so from Westholt's first memory of the time when\nhis childish individuality began to detach itself from the background of\nmisty and indistinct things. They had liked each other, and their liking\nand intimacy had increased with the onward moving and change of years.\nAfter sixty sane and decently spent active years of life, Lord Dunholm,\nin either country tweed or evening dress, was a well-built and handsome\nman; at thirty-three his son was still like him.\n\n\"Have you seen her?\" he was saying.\n\n\"Only at a distance. She was driving Lady Anstruthers across the marshes\nin a cart. She drove well and----\" he laughed as he flicked the ash from\nhis cigar--\"the back of her head and shoulders looked handsome.\"\n\n\"The American young woman is at present a factor which is without doubt\nto be counted with,\" Lord Dunholm put the matter without lightness. \"Any\nyoung woman is a factor, but the American young woman just now--just\nnow----\" He paused a moment as though considering. \"It did not seem at\nall necessary to count with them at first, when they began to appear\namong us. They were generally curiously exotic, funny little creatures\nwith odd manners and voices. They were often most amusing, and one liked\nto hear them chatter and see the airy lightness with which they took\nsuperfluous, and sometimes unsuperfluous, conventions, as a hunter takes\na five-barred gate. But it never occurred to us to marry them. We did\nnot take them seriously enough. But we began to marry them--we began to\nmarry them, my good fellow!\"\n\nThe final words broke forth with such a suggestion of sudden anxiety\nthat, in spite of himself, Westholt laughed involuntarily, and his\nfather, turning to look at him, laughed also. But he recovered his\nseriousness.\n\n\"It was all rather a muddle at first,\" he went on. \"Things were not\nfairly done, and certain bad lots looked on it as a paying scheme on the\none side, while it was a matter of silly, little ambitions on the other.\nBut that it is an extraordinary country there is no sane denying--huge,\nfabulously resourceful in every way--area, variety of climate, wealth of\nminerals, products of all sorts, soil to grow anything, and sun and rain\nenough to give each thing what it needs; last, or rather first, a people\nwho, considered as a nation, are in the riot of youth, and who began by\nbeing English--which we Englishmen have an innocent belief is the one\nmethod of 'owning the earth.' That figure of speech is an Americanism I\ncarefully committed to memory. Well, after all, look at the map--look at\nthe map! There we are.\"\n\nThey had frequently discussed together the question of the development\nof international relations. Lord Dunholm, a man of far-reaching and\nclear logic, had realised that the oddly unaccentuated growth of\nintercourse between the two countries might be a subject to be reflected\non without lightness.\n\n\"The habit we have of regarding America and Americans as rather a joke,\"\nhe had once said, \"has a sort of parallel in the condescendingly amiable\namusement of a parent at the precocity or whimsicalness of a child. But\nthe child is shooting up amazingly--amazingly. In a way which suggests\ndivers possibilities.\"\n\nThe exchange of visits between Dunholm and Stornham had been rare and\nformal. From the call made upon the younger Lady Anstruthers on her\nmarriage, the Dunholms had returned with a sense of puzzled pity for the\nlittle American bride, with her wonderful frock and her uneasy, childish\neyes. For some years Lady Anstruthers had been too delicate to make\nor return calls. One heard painful accounts of her apparent wretched\nill-health and of the condition of her husband's estate.\n\n\"As the relations between the two families have evidently been strained\nfor years,\" Lord Dunholm said, \"it is interesting to hear of the sudden\nadvent of the sister. It seems to point to reconciliation. And you say\nthe girl is an unusual person.\n\n\"From what one hears, she would be unusual if she were an English girl\nwho had spent her life on an English estate. That an American who\nis making her first visit to England should seem to see at once the\npractical needs of a neglected place is a thing to wonder at. What can\nshe know about it, one thinks. But she apparently does know. They say\nshe has made no mistakes--even with the village people. She is managing,\nin one way or another, to give work to every man who wants it. Result,\nof course--unbounded rustic enthusiasm.\"\n\nLord Dunholm laughed between the soothing whiffs of his cigar.\n\n\"How clever of her! And what sensible good feeling! Yes--yes! She\nevidently has learned things somewhere. Perhaps New York has found\nit wise to begin to give young women professional training in the\nmanagement of English estates. Who knows? Not a bad idea.\"\n\nIt was the rustic enthusiasm, Westholt explained, which had in a manner\nspread her fame. One heard enlightening and illustrative anecdotes of\nher. He related several well worth hearing. She had evidently a sense of\nhumour and unexpected perceptions.\n\n\"One detail of the story of old Doby's meerschaum,\" Westholt said,\n\"pleased me enormously. She managed to convey to him--without hurting\nhis aged feelings or overwhelming him with embarrassment--that if he\npreferred a clean churchwarden or his old briarwood, he need not feel\nobliged to smoke the new pipe. He could regard it as a trophy. Now, how\ndid she do that without filling him with fright and confusion, lest she\nmight think him not sufficiently grateful for her present? But they\ntell me she did it, and that old Doby is rapturously happy and takes the\nmeerschaum to bed with him, but only smokes it on Sundays--sitting at\nhis window blowing great clouds when his neighbours are coming from\nchurch. It was a clever girl who knew that an old fellow might secretly\nlike his old pipe best.\"\n\n\"It was a deliciously clever girl,\" said Lord Dunholm. \"One wants to\nknow and make friends with her. We must drive over and call. I confess,\nI rather congratulate myself that Anstruthers is not at home.\"\n\n\"So do I,\" Westholt answered. \"One wonders a little how far he and his\nsister-in-law will 'foregather' when he returns. He's an unpleasant\nbeggar.\"\n\nA few days later Mrs. Brent, returning from a call on Mrs. Charley\nJenkins, was passed by a carriage whose liveries she recognised half way\nup the village street. It was the carriage from Dunholm Castle. Lord and\nLady Dunholm and Lord Westholt sat in it. They were, of course, going\nto call at the Court. Miss Vanderpoel was beginning to draw people. She\nnaturally would. She would be likely to make quite a difference in the\nneighbourhood now that it had heard of her and Lady Anstruthers had been\nseen driving with her, evidently no longer an unvisitable invalid, but\nactually decently clothed and in her right mind. Mrs. Brent slackened\nher steps that she might have the pleasure of receiving and responding\ngracefully to salutations from the important personages in the landau.\nShe felt that the Dunholms were important. There were earldoms AND\nearldoms, and that of Dunholm was dignified and of distinction.\n\nA common-looking young man on a bicycle, who had wheeled into the\nvillage with the carriage, riding alongside it for a hundred yards or\nso, stopped before the Clock Inn and dismounted, just as Mrs. Brent\nneared him. He saw her looking after the equipage, and lifting his cap\nspoke to her civilly.\n\n\"This is Stornham village, ain't it, ma'am?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Yes, my man.\" His costume and general aspect seemed to indicate that he\nwas of the class one addressed as \"my man,\" though there was something a\nlittle odd about him.\n\n\"Thank you. That wasn't Miss Vanderpoel's eldest sister in that\ncarriage, was it?\"\n\n\"Miss Vanderpoel's----\" Mrs. Brent hesitated. \"Do you mean Lady\nAnstruthers?\"\n\n\"I'd forgotten her name. I know Miss Vanderpoel's eldest sister lives at\nStornham--Reuben S. Vanderpoel's daughter.\"\n\n\"Lady Anstruthers' younger sister is a Miss Vanderpoel, and she is\nvisiting at Stornham Court now.\" Mrs. Brent could not help adding,\ncuriously, \"Why do you ask?\"\n\n\"I am going to see her. I'm an American.\"\n\nMrs. Brent coughed to cover a slight gasp. She had heard remarkable\nthings of the democratic customs of America. It was painful not to be\nable to ask questions.\n\n\"The lady in the carriage was the Countess of Dunholm,\" she said rather\ngrandly. \"They are going to the Court to call on Miss Vanderpoel.\"\n\n\"Then Miss Vanderpoel's there yet. That's all right. Thank you, ma'am,\"\nand lifting his cap again he turned into the little public house.\n\nThe Dunholm party had been accustomed on their rare visits to Stornham\nto be received by the kind of man-servant in the kind of livery which\nis a manifest, though unwilling, confession. The men who threw open the\ndoors were of regulation height, well dressed, and of trained bearing.\nThe entrance hall had lost its hopeless shabbiness. It was a complete\nand picturesquely luxurious thing. The change suggested magic. The magic\nwhich had been used, Lord Dunholm reflected, was the simplest and most\npowerful on earth. Given surroundings, combined with a gift for knowing\nvalues of form and colour, if you have the power to spend thousands of\nguineas on tiger skins, Oriental rugs, and other beauties, barrenness is\neasily transformed.\n\nThe drawing-room wore a changed aspect, and at a first glance it was to\nbe seen that in poor little Lady Anstruthers, as she had generally been\ncalled, there was to be noted alteration also. In her case the\nchange, being in its first stages, could not perhaps be yet called\ntransformation, but, aided by softly pretty arrangement of dress and\nhair, a light in her eyes, and a suggestion of pink under her skin, one\nrecalled that she had once been a pretty little woman, and that after\nall she was only about thirty-two years old.\n\nThat her sister, Miss Vanderpoel, had beauty, it was not necessary to\nhesitate in deciding. Neither Lord Dunholm nor his wife nor their\nson did hesitate. A girl with long limbs an alluring profile, and\nextraordinary black lashes set round lovely Irish-blue eyes, possesses\nphysical capital not to be argued about.\n\nShe was not one of the curious, exotic little creatures, whose thin,\nthough sometimes rather sweet, and always gay, high-pitched young voices\nLord Dunholm had been so especially struck by in the early days of the\nAmerican invasion. Her voice had a tone one would be likely to remember\nwith pleasure. How well she moved--how well her black head was set on\nher neck! Yes, she was of the new type--the later generation.\n\nThese amazing, oddly practical people had evolved it--planned it,\nperhaps, bought--figuratively speaking--the architects and material to\ndesign and build it--bought them in whatever country they found them,\nEngland, France, Italy Germany--pocketing them coolly and carrying them\nback home to develop, complete, and send forth into the world when their\ninvention was a perfected thing. Struck by the humour of his fancy, Lord\nDunholm found himself smiling into the Irish-blue eyes. They smiled\nback at him in a way which warmed his heart. There were no pauses in\nthe conversation which followed. In times past, calls at Stornham had\ngenerally held painfully blank moments. Lady Dunholm was as pleased as\nher husband. A really charming girl was an enormous acquisition to the\nneighbourhood.\n\nWestholt, his father saw, had found even more than the story of old\nDoby's pipe had prepared him to expect.\n\nCountry calls were not usually interesting or stimulating, and this one\nwas. Lord Dunholm laid subtly brilliant plans to lead Miss Vanderpoel to\ntalk of her native land and her views of it. He knew that she would say\nthings worth hearing. Incidentally one gathered picturesque detail. To\nhave vibrated between the two continents since her thirteenth year, to\nhave spent a few years at school in one country, a few years in another,\nand yet a few years more in still another, as part of an arranged\neducational plan; to have crossed the Atlantic for the holidays, and to\nhave journeyed thousands of miles with her father in his private car; to\nmake the visits of a man of great schemes to his possessions of mines,\nrailroads, and lands which were almost principalities--these things had\nbeen merely details of her life, adding interest and variety, it was\ntrue, but seeming the merely normal outcome of existence. They were\nnormal to Vanderpoels and others of their class who were abnormalities\nin themselves when compared with the rest of the world.\n\nHer own very lack of any abnormality reached, in Lord Dunholm's mind,\nthe highest point of illustration of the phase of life she beautifully\nrepresented--for beautiful he felt its rare charms were.\n\nWhen they strolled out to look at the gardens he found talk with her no\nless a stimulating thing. She told her story of Kedgers, and showed\nthe chosen spot where thickets of lilies were to bloom, with the giants\nlifting white archangel trumpets above them in the centre.\n\n\"He can be trusted,\" she said. \"I feel sure he can be trusted. He loves\nthem. He could not love them so much and not be able to take care of\nthem.\" And as she looked at him in frank appeal for sympathy, Lord\nDunholm felt that for the moment she looked like a tall, queenly child.\n\nBut pleased as he was, he presently gave up his place at her side to\nWestholt. He must not be a selfish old fellow and monopolise her. He\nhoped they would see each other often, he said charmingly. He thought\nshe would be sure to like Dunholm, which was really a thoroughly English\nold place, marked by all the features she seemed so much attracted by.\nThere were some beautiful relics of the past there, and some rather\nshocking ones--certain dungeons, for instance, and a gallows mount,\non which in good old times the family gallows had stood. This had\napparently been a working adjunct to the domestic arrangements of every\nrespectable family, and that irritating persons should dangle from\nit had been a simple domestic necessity, if one were to believe old\nstories.\n\n\"It was then that nobles were regarded with respect,\" he said, with his\nfine smile. \"In the days when a man appeared with clang of arms and\nwith javelins and spears before, and donjon keeps in the background, the\nattitude of bent knees and awful reverence were the inevitable results.\nWhen one could hang a servant on one's own private gallows, or chop off\nhis hand for irreverence or disobedience--obedience and reverence were a\nrule. Now, a month's notice is the extremity of punishment, and the old\npomp of armed servitors suggests comic opera. But we can show you relics\nof it at Dunholm.\"\n\nHe joined his wife and began at once to make himself so delightful to\nRosy that she ceased to be afraid of him, and ended by talking almost\ngaily of her London visit.\n\nBetty and Westholt walked together. The afternoon being lovely, they had\nall sauntered into the park to look at certain views, and the sun\nwas shining between the trees. Betty thought the young man almost as\ncharming as his father, which was saying much. She had fallen wholly in\nlove with Lord Dunholm--with his handsome, elderly face, his voice, his\nerect bearing, his fine smile, his attraction of manner, his courteous\nease and wit. He was one of the men who stood for the best of all they\nhad been born to represent. Her own father, she felt, stood for the best\nof all such an American as himself should be. Lord Westholt would in\ntime be what his father was. He had inherited from him good looks, good\nfeeling, and a sense of humour. Yes, he had been given from the outset\nall that the other man had been denied. She was thinking of Mount\nDunstan as \"the other man,\" and spoke of him.\n\n\"You know Lord Mount Dunstan?\" she said.\n\nWestholt hesitated slightly.\n\n\"Yes--and no,\" he answered, after the hesitation. \"No one knows him very\nwell. You have not met him?\" with a touch of surprise in his tone.\n\n\"He was a passenger on the Meridiana when I last crossed the Atlantic.\nThere was a slight accident and we were thrown together for a few\nmoments. Afterwards I met him by chance again. I did not know who he\nwas.\"\n\nLord Westholt showed signs of hesitation anew. In fact, he was rather\ndisturbed. She evidently did not know anything whatever of the Mount\nDunstans. She would not be likely to hear the details of the scandal\nwhich had obliterated them, as it were, from the decent world.\n\nThe present man, though he had not openly been mixed up with the hideous\nthing, had borne the brand because he had not proved himself to possess\nany qualities likely to recommend him. It was generally understood that\nhe was a bad lot also. To such a man the allurements such a young\nwoman as Miss Vanderpoel would present would be extraordinary. It was\nunfortunate that she should have been thrown in his way. At the same\ntime it was not possible to state the case clearly during one's first\ncall on a beautiful stranger.\n\n\"His going to America was rather spirited,\" said the mellow voice beside\nhim. \"I thought only Americans took their fates in their hands in\nthat way. For a man of his class to face a rancher's life means\ndetermination. It means the spirit----\" with a low little laugh at the\nleap of her imagination--\"of the men who were Mount Dunstans in early\ndays and went forth to fight for what they meant to have. He went to\nfight. He ought to have won. He will win some day.\"\n\n\"I do not know about fighting,\" Lord Westholt answered. Had the fellow\nbeen telling her romantic stories? \"The general impression was that he\nwent to America to amuse himself.\"\n\n\"No, he did not do that,\" said Betty, with simple finality. \"A sheep\nranch is not amusing----\" She stopped short and stood still for a\nmoment. They had been walking down the avenue, and she stopped because\nher eyes had been caught by a figure half sitting, half lying in the\nmiddle of the road, a prostrate bicycle near it. It was the figure of\na cheaply dressed young man, who, as she looked, seemed to make an\nineffectual effort to rise.\n\n\"Is that man ill?\" she exclaimed. \"I think he must be.\" They went\ntowards him at once, and when they reached him he lifted a dazed white\nface, down which a stream of blood was trickling from a cut on his\nforehead. He was, in fact, very white indeed, and did not seem to know\nwhat he was doing.\n\n\"I am afraid you are hurt,\" Betty said, and as she spoke the rest of\nthe party joined them. The young man vacantly smiled, and making an\nunconscious-looking pass across his face with his hand, smeared the\nblood over his features painfully. Betty kneeled down, and drawing out\nher handkerchief, lightly wiped the gruesome smears away. Lord Westholt\nsaw what had happened, having given a look at the bicycle.\n\n\"His chain broke as he was coming down the incline, and as he fell he\ngot a nasty knock on this stone,\" touching with his foot a rather large\none, which had evidently fallen from some cartload of building material.\n\nThe young man, still vacantly smiling, was fumbling at his breast\npocket. He began to talk incoherently in good, nasal New York, at\nthe mere sound of which Lady Anstruthers made a little yearning step\nforward.\n\n\"Superior any other,\" he muttered. \"Tabulator spacer--marginal release\nkey--call your 'tention--instantly--'justable--Delkoff--no equal on\nmarket.\" And having found what he had fumbled for, he handed a card to\nMiss Vanderpoel and sank unconscious on her breast.\n\n\"Let me support him, Miss Vanderpoel,\" said Westholt, starting forward.\n\n\"Never mind, thank you,\" said Betty. \"If he has fainted I suppose he\nmust be laid flat on the ground. Will you please to read the card.\"\n\nIt was the card Mount Dunstan had read the day before.\n\nJ. BURRIDGE & SON,\n\nDELKOFF TYPEWRITER CO.\n\nBROADWAY, NEW YORK. G. SELDEN.\n\n\n\"He is probably G. Selden,\" said Westholt. \"Travelling in the interests\nof his firm, poor chap. The clue is not of much immediate use, however.\"\n\nThey were fortunately not far from the house, and Westholt went back\nquickly to summon servants and send for the village doctor. The Dunholms\nwere kindly sympathetic, and each of the party lent a handkerchief to\nstaunch the bleeding. Lord Dunholm helped Miss Vanderpoel to lay the\nyoung man down carefully.\n\n\"I am afraid,\" he said; \"I am really afraid his leg is broken. It was\ntwisted under him. What can be done with him?\"\n\nMiss Vanderpoel looked at her sister.\n\n\"Will you allow him to be carried to the house temporarily, Rosy?\" she\nasked. \"There is apparently nothing else to be done.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Lady Anstruthers. \"How could one send him away, poor\nfellow! Let him be carried to the house.\"\n\nMiss Vanderpoel smiled into Lord Dunholm's much approving, elderly eyes.\n\n\"G. Selden is a compatriot,\" she said. \"Perhaps he heard I was here and\ncame to sell me a typewriter.\"\n\nLord Westholt returning with two footmen and a light mattress, G. Selden\nwas carried with cautious care to the house. The afternoon sun,\nbreaking through the branches of the ancestral oaks, kindly touched his\nkeen-featured, white young face. Lord Dunholm and Lord Westholt each\nlent a friendly hand, and Miss Vanderpoel, keeping near, once or twice\nwiped away an insistent trickle of blood which showed itself from\nbeneath the handkerchiefs. Lady Dunholm followed with Lady Anstruthers.\n\nAfterwards, during his convalescence, G. Selden frequently felt with\nregret that by his unconsciousness of the dignity of his cortege at the\nmoment he had missed feeling himself to be for once in a position\nhe would have designated as \"out of sight\" in the novelty of its\nimportance. To have beheld him, borne by nobles and liveried menials,\naccompanied by ladies of title, up the avenue of an English park on his\nway to be cared for in baronial halls, would, he knew, have added a\njoy to the final moments of his grandmother, which the consolations of\nreligion could scarcely have met equally in competition. His own point\nof view, however, would not, it is true, have been that of the old woman\nin the black net cap and purple ribbons, but of a less reverent nature.\nHis enjoyment, in fact, would have been based upon that transatlantic\nsense of humour, whose soul is glee at the incompatible, which would\nhave been full fed by the incongruity of \"Little Willie being yanked\nalong by a bunch of earls, and Reuben S. Vanderpoel's daughters\nfollowing the funeral.\" That he himself should have been unconscious of\nthe situation seemed to him like \"throwing away money.\"\n\nThe doctor arriving after he had been put to bed found slight concussion\nof the brain and a broken leg. With Lady Anstruthers' kind permission,\nit would certainly be best that he should remain for the present where\nhe was. So, in a bedroom whose windows looked out upon spreading lawns\nand broad-branched trees, he was as comfortably established as was\npossible. G. Selden, through the capricious intervention of Fate, if\nhe had not \"got next\" to Reuben S. Vanderpoel himself, had most\nundisputably \"got next\" to his favourite daughter.\n\nAs the Dunholm carriage rolled down the avenue there reigned for a few\nminutes a reflective silence. It was Lady Dunholm who broke it. \"That,\"\nshe said in her softly decided voice, \"that is a nice girl.\"\n\nLord Dunholm's agreeable, humorous smile flickered into evidence.\n\n\"That is it,\" he said. \"Thank you, Eleanor, for supplying me with a\nquite delightful early Victorian word. I believe I wanted it. She is a\nbeauty and she is clever. She is a number of other things--but she is\nalso a nice girl. If you will allow me to say so, I have fallen in love\nwith her.\"\n\n\"If you will allow me to say so,\" put in Westholt, \"so have I--quite\nfatally.\"\n\n\"That,\" said his father, with speculation in his eye, \"is more serious.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\n\"WHAT IT MUST BE TO YOU--JUST YOU!\"\n\nG. Selden, awakening to consciousness two days later, lay and stared\nat the chintz covering of the top of his four-post bed through a few\nminutes of vacant amazement. It was a four-post bed he was lying on,\nwasn't it? And his leg was bandaged and felt unmovable. The last thing\nhe remembered was going down an incline in a tree-bordered avenue. There\nwas nothing more. He had been all right then. Was this a four-post bed\nor was it not? Yes, it was. And was it part of the furnishings of a\nswell bedroom--the kind of bedroom he had never been in before? Tip top,\nin fact? He stared and tried to recall things--but could not, and in his\nbewilderment exclaimed aloud.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"if this ain't the limit! You may search ME!\"\n\nA respectable person in a white apron came to him from the other side of\nthe room. It was Buttle's wife, who had been hastily called in.\n\n\"Sh--sh,\" she said soothingly. \"Don't you worry. Nobody ain't goin' to\nsearch you. Nobody ain't. There! Sh, sh, sh,\" rather as if he were a\nbaby. Beginning to be conscious of a curious sense of weakness, Selden\nlay and stared at her in a helplessness which might have been considered\npathetic. Perhaps he had got \"bats in his belfry,\" and there was no use\nin talking.\n\nAt that moment, however, the door opened and a young lady entered.\nShe was \"a looker,\" G. Selden's weakness did not interfere with his\nperceiving. \"A looker, by gee!\" She was dressed, as if for going out,\nin softly tinted, exquisite things, and a large, strange hydrangea blue\nflower under the brim of her hat rested on soft and full black hair. The\nblack hair gave him a clue. It was hair like that he had seen as Reuben\nS. Vanderpoel's daughter rode by when he stood at the park gates at\nMount Dunstan. \"Bats in his belfry,\" of course.\n\n\"How is he?\" she said to the nurse.\n\n\"He's been seeming comfortable all day, miss,\" the woman answered, \"but\nhe's light-headed yet. He opened his eyes quite sensible looking a bit\nago, but he spoke queer. He said something was the limit, and that we\nmight search him.\"\n\nBetty approached the bedside to look at him, and meeting the disturbed\ninquiry in his uplifted eyes, laughed, because, seeing that he was not\ndelirious, she thought she understood. She had not lived in New York\nwithout hearing its argot, and she realised that the exclamation which\nhad appeared delirium to Mrs. Buttle had probably indicated that the\nunexplainableness of the situation in which G. Selden found himself\nstruck him as reaching the limit of probability, and that the most\nextended search of his person would fail to reveal any clue to\nsatisfactory explanation.\n\nShe bent over him, with her laugh still shining in her eyes.\n\n\"I hope you feel better. Can you tell me?\" she said.\n\nHis voice was not strong, but his answer was that of a young man who\nknew what he was saying.\n\n\"If I'm not off my head, ma'am, I'm quite comfortable, thank you,\" he\nreplied.\n\n\"I am glad to hear that,\" said Betty. \"Don't be disturbed. Your mind is\nquite clear.\"\n\n\"All I want,\" said G. Selden impartially, \"is just to know where I'm at,\nand how I blew in here. It would help me to rest better.\"\n\n\"You met with an accident,\" the \"looker\" explained, still smiling with\nboth lips and eyes. \"Your bicycle chain broke and you were thrown and\nhurt yourself. It happened in the avenue in the park. We found you and\nbrought you in. You are at Stornham Court, which belongs to Sir Nigel\nAnstruthers. Lady Anstruthers is my sister. I am Miss Vanderpoel.\"\n\n\"Hully gee!\" ejaculated G. Selden inevitably. \"Hully GEE!\" The splendour\nof the moment was such that his brain whirled. As it was not yet in the\nphysical condition to whirl with any comfort, he found himself closing\nhis eyes weakly.\n\n\"That's right,\" Miss Vanderpoel said. \"Keep them closed. I must not\ntalk to you until you are stronger. Lie still and try not to think.\nThe doctor says you are getting on very well. I will come and see you\nagain.\"\n\nAs the soft sweep of her dress reached the door he managed to open his\neyes.\n\n\"Thank you, Miss Vanderpoel,\" he said. \"Thank you, ma'am.\" And as his\neyelids closed again he murmured in luxurious peace: \"Well, if that's\nher--she can have ME--and welcome!\"\n\n*****\n\nShe came to see him again each day--sometimes in a linen frock and\ngarden hat, sometimes in her soft tints and lace and flowers before or\nafter her drive in the afternoon, and two or three times in the evening,\nwith lovely shoulders and wonderfully trailing draperies--looking like\nthe women he had caught far-off glimpses of on the rare occasion of his\nhaving indulged himself in the highest and most remotely placed seat in\nthe gallery at the opera, which inconvenience he had borne not through\nany ardent desire to hear the music, but because he wanted to see\nthe show and get \"a look-in\" at the Four Hundred. He believed very\nimplicitly in his Four Hundred, and privately--though perhaps almost\nunconsciously--cherished the distinction his share of them conferred\nupon him, as fondly as the English young man of his rudimentary type\ncherishes his dukes and duchesses. The English young man may revel in\nhis coroneted beauties in photograph shops, the young American dwells\nfondly on flattering, or very unflattering, reproductions of his\nmulti-millionaires' wives and daughters in the voluminous illustrated\nsheets of his Sunday paper, without which life would be a wretched and\nsavourless thing.\n\nSelden had never seen Miss Vanderpoel in his Sunday paper, and here he\nwas lying in a room in the same house with her. And she coming in to see\nhim and talk to him as if he was one of the Four Hundred himself! The\ncomfort and luxury with which he found himself surrounded sank into\ninsignificance when compared with such unearthly luck as this. Lady\nAnstruthers came in to see him also, and she several times brought with\nher a queer little lame fellow, who was spoken of as \"Master Ughtred.\"\n\"Master\" was supposed by G. Selden to be a sort of title conferred upon\nthe small sons of baronets and the like. The children he knew in New\nYork and elsewhere answered to the names of Bob, or Jimmy, or Bill. No\nparallel to \"Master\" had been in vogue among them.\n\nLady Anstruthers was not like her sister. She was a little thing, and\nboth she and Master Ughtred seemed fond of talking of New York. She had\nnot been home for years, and the youngster had never seen it at all.\nHe had some queer ideas about America, and seemed never to have seen\nanything but Stornham and the village. G. Selden liked him, and was\nvaguely sorry for a little chap to whom a description of the festivities\nattendant upon the Fourth of July and a Presidential election seemed\nlike stories from the Arabian Nights.\n\n\"Tell me about the Tammany Tiger, if you please,\" he said once. \"I want\nto know what kind of an animal it is.\"\n\nFrom a point of view somewhat different from that of Mount Dunstan and\nMr. Penzance, Betty Vanderpoel found talk with him interesting. To her\nhe did not wear the aspect of a foreign product. She had not met and\nconversed with young men like him, but she knew of them. Stringent\nprecautions were taken to protect her father from their ingenuous\nenterprises. They were not permitted to enter his offices; they were\neven discouraged from hovering about their neighbourhood when seen and\nsuspected. The atmosphere, it was understood, was to be, if possible,\ndisinfected of agents. This one, lying softly in the four-post bed,\ncheerfully grateful for the kindness shown him, and plainly filled with\ndelight in his adventure, despite the physical discomforts attending\nit, gave her, as he began to recover, new views of the life he lived in\ncommon with his kind. It was like reading scenes from a realistic novel\nof New York life to listen to his frank, slangy conversation. To her,\nas well as to Mr. Penzance, sidelights were thrown upon existence in the\n\"hall bedroom\" and upon previously unknown phases of business life in\nBroadway and roaring \"downtown\" streets.\n\nHis determination, his sharp readiness, his control of temper under\nrebuff and superfluous harshness, his odd, impersonal summing up of men\nand things, and good-natured patience with the world in general, were,\nshe knew, business assets. She was even moved--no less--by the remote\nconnection of such a life with that of the first Reuben Vanderpoel who\nhad laid the huge, solid foundations of their modern fortune. The first\nReuben Vanderpoel must have seen and known the faces of men as G.\nSelden saw and knew them. Fighting his way step by step, knocking\npertinaciously at every gateway which might give ingress to some passage\nleading to even the smallest gain, meeting with rebuff and indifference\nonly to be overcome by steady and continued assault--if G. Selden was a\nnuisance, the first Vanderpoel had without doubt worn that aspect upon\ninnumerable occasions. No one desires the presence of the man who while\nhaving nothing to give must persist in keeping himself in evidence, even\nif by strategy or force. From stories she was familiar with, she had\ngathered that the first Reuben Vanderpoel had certainly lacked a certain\nyouth of soul she felt in this modern struggler for life. He had been\nthe cleverer man of the two; G. Selden she secretly liked the better.\n\nThe curiosity of Mrs. Buttle, who was the nurse, had been awakened by a\nsingular feature of her patient's feverish wanderings.\n\n\"He keeps muttering, miss, things I can't make out about Lord Mount\nDunstan, and Mr. Penzance, and some child he calls Little Willie. He\ntalks to them the same as if he knew them--same as if he was with them\nand they were talking to him quite friendly.\"\n\nOne morning Betty, coming to make her visit of inquiry found the patient\nlooking thoughtful, and when she commented upon his air of pondering,\nhis reply cast light upon the mystery.\n\n\"Well, Miss Vanderpoel,\" he explained, \"I was lying here thinking of\nLord Mount Dunstan and Mr. Penzance, and how well they treated me--I\nhaven't told you about that, have I?\n\n\"That explains what Mrs. Buttle said,\" she answered. \"When you were\ndelirious you talked frequently to Lord Mount Dunstan and Mr. Penzance.\nWe both wondered why.\"\n\nThen he told her the whole story. Beginning with his sitting on the\ngrassy bank outside the park, listening to the song of the robin,\nhe ended with the adieux at the entrance gates when the sound of her\nhorse's trotting hoofs had been heard by each of them.\n\n\"What I've been lying here thinking of,\" he said, \"is how queer it was\nit happened just that way. If I hadn't stopped just that minute, and if\nyou hadn't gone by, and if Lord Mount Dunstan hadn't known you and said\nwho you were, Little Willie would have been in London by this time,\nhustling to get a cheap bunk back to New York in.\"\n\n\"Because?\" inquired Miss Vanderpoel.\n\nG. Selden laughed and hesitated a moment. Then he made a clean breast of\nit.\n\n\"Say, Miss Vanderpoel,\" he said, \"I hope it won't make you mad if I\nown up. Ladies like you don't know anything about chaps like me. On the\nsquare and straight out, when I seen you and heard your name I couldn't\nhelp remembering whose daughter you was. Reuben S. Vanderpoel spells a\nbig thing. Why, when I was in New York we fellows used to get together\nand talk about what it'd mean to the chap who could get next to Reuben\nS. Vanderpoel. We used to count up all the business he does, and all the\nclerks he's got under him pounding away on typewriters, and how they'd\nbe bound to get worn out and need new ones. And we'd make calculations\nhow many a man could unload, if he could get next. It was a kind of\ntypewriting junior assistant fairy story, and we knew it couldn't happen\nreally. But we used to chin about it just for the fun of the thing.\nOne of the boys made up a thing about one of us saving Reuben S.'s\nlife--dragging him from under a runaway auto and, when he says, 'What\ncan I do to show my gratitude, young man?' him handing out his catalogue\nand saying, 'I should like to call your attention to the Delkoff, sir,'\nand getting him to promise he'd never use any other, as long as he\nlived!\"\n\nReuben S. Vanderpoel's daughter laughed as spontaneously as any girl\nmight have done. G. Selden laughed with her. At any rate, she hadn't got\nmad, so far.\n\n\"That was what did it,\" he went on. \"When I rode away on my bike I got\nthinking about it and could not get it out of my head. The next day I\njust stopped on the road and got off my wheel, and I says to myself:\n'Look here, business is business, if you ARE travelling in Europe and\nlunching at Buckingham Palace with the main squeeze. Get busy! What'll\nthe boys say if they hear you've missed a chance like this? YOU hit the\npike for Stornham Castle, or whatever it's called, and take your nerve\nwith you! She can't do more than have you fired out, and you've been\nfired before and got your breath after it. So I turned round and made\ntime. And that was how I happened on your avenue. And perhaps it was\nbecause I was feeling a bit rattled I lost my hold when the chain broke,\nand pitched over on my head. There, I've got it off my chest. I was\nthinking I should have to explain somehow.\"\n\nSomething akin to her feeling of affection for the nice, long-legged\nWesterner she had seen rambling in Bond Street touched Betty again.\nThe Delkoff was the centre of G. Selden's world as the flowers were of\nKedgers', as the \"little 'ome\" was of Mrs. Welden's.\n\n\"Were you going to try to sell ME a typewriter?\" she asked.\n\n\"Well,\" G. Selden admitted, \"I didn't know but what there might be use\nfor one, writing business letters on a big place like this. Straight, I\nwon't say I wasn't going to try pretty hard. It may look like gall, but\nyou see a fellow has to rush things or he'll never get there. A chap\nlike me HAS to get there, somehow.\"\n\nShe was silent a few moments and looked as if she was thinking something\nover. Her silence and this look on her face actually caused to dawn in\nthe breast of Selden a gleam of daring hope. He looked round at her with\na faint rising of colour.\n\n\"Say, Miss Vanderpoel--say----\" he began, and then broke off.\n\n\"Yes?\" said Betty, still thinking.\n\n\"C-COULD you use one--anywhere?\" he said. \"I don't want to rush things\ntoo much, but--COULD you?\"\n\n\"Is it easy to learn to use it?\"\n\n\"Easy!\" his head lifted from his pillow. \"It's as easy as falling off\na log. A baby in a perambulator could learn to tick off orders for its\nbottle. And--on the square--there isn't its equal on the market, Miss\nVanderpoel--there isn't.\" He fumbled beneath his pillow and actually\nbrought forth his catalogue.\n\n\"I asked the nurse to put it there. I wanted to study it now and then\nand think up arguments. See--adjustable to hold with perfect ease an\nenvelope, an index card, or a strip of paper no wider than a postage\nstamp. Unsurpassed paper feed, practical ribbon mechanism--perfect and\npermanent alignment.\"\n\nAs Mount Dunstan had taken the book, Betty Vanderpoel took it. Never had\nG. Selden beheld such smiling in eyes about to bend upon his catalogue.\n\n\"You will raise your temperature,\" she said, \"if you excite yourself.\nYou mustn't do that. I believe there are two or three people on the\nestate who might be taught to use a typewriter. I will buy three.\nYes--we will say three.\"\n\nShe would buy three. He soared to heights. He did not know how to thank\nher, though he did his best. Dizzying visions of what he would have to\ntell \"the boys\" when he returned to New York flashed across his mind.\nThe daughter of Reuben S. Vanderpoel had bought three Delkoffs, and he\nwas the junior assistant who had sold them to her.\n\n\"You don't know what it means to me, Miss Vanderpoel,\" he said, \"but if\nyou were a junior salesman you'd know. It's not only the sale--though\nthat's a rake-off of fifteen dollars to me--but it's because it's YOU\nthat's bought them. Gee!\" gazing at her with a frank awe whose obvious\nsincerity held a queer touch of pathos. \"What it must be to be YOU--just\nYOU!\"\n\nShe did not laugh. She felt as if a hand had lightly touched her on\nher naked heart. She had thought of it so often--had been bewildered\nrestlessly by it as a mere child--this difference in human lot--this\nchance. Was it chance which had placed her entity in the centre of\nBettina Vanderpoel's world instead of in that of some little cash girl\nwith hair raked back from a sallow face, who stared at her as she passed\nin a shop--or in that of the young Frenchwoman whose life was spent\nin serving her, in caring for delicate dresses and keeping guard over\nornaments whose price would have given to her own humbleness ease for\nthe rest of existence? What did it mean? And what Law was laid upon her?\nWhat Law which could only work through her and such as she who had\nbeen born with almost unearthly power laid in their hands--the reins\nof monstrous wealth, which guided or drove the world? Sometimes fear\ntouched her, as with this light touch an her heart, because she did not\nKNOW the Law and could only pray that her guessing at it might be right.\nAnd, even as she thought these things, G. Selden went on.\n\n\"You never can know,\" he said, \"because you've always been in it. And\nthe rest of the world can't know, because they've never been anywhere\nnear it.\" He stopped and evidently fell to thinking.\n\n\"Tell me about the rest of the world,\" said Betty quietly.\n\nHe laughed again.\n\n\"Why, I was just thinking to myself you didn't know a thing about it.\nAnd it's queer. It's the rest of us that mounts up when you come to\nnumbers. I guess it'd run into millions. I'm not thinking of beggars and\nstarving people, I've been rushing the Delkoff too steady to get onto\nany swell charity organisation, so I don't know about them. I'm just\nthinking of the millions of fellows, and women, too, for the matter of\nthat, that waken up every morning and know they've got to hustle for\ntheir ten per or their fifteen per--if they can stir it up as thick as\nthat. If it's as much as fifty per, of course, seems like to me, they're\non Easy Street. But sometimes those that's got to fifty per--or even\nmore--have got more things to do with it--kids, you know, and more rent\nand clothes. They've got to get at it just as hard as we have. Why, Miss\nVanderpoel, how many people do you suppose there are in a million that\ndon't have to worry over their next month's grocery bills, and the rent\nof their flat? I bet there's not ten--and I don't know the ten.\"\n\nHe did not state his case uncheerfully. \"The rest of the world\"\nrepresented to him the normal condition of things.\n\n\"Most married men's a bit afraid to look an honest grocery bill in the\nface. And they WILL come in--as regular as spring hats. And I tell YOU,\nwhen a man's got to live on seventy-five a month, a thing that'll take\nall the strength and energy out of a twenty-dollar bill sorter gets him\ndown on the mat.\"\n\nLike old Mrs. Welden's, his roughly sketched picture was a graphic one.\n\n\"'Tain't the working that bothers most of us. We were born to that, and\nmost of us would feel like deadbeats if we were doing nothing. It's the\nearning less than you can live on, and getting a sort of tired feeling\nover it. It's the having to make a dollar-bill look like two, and\nwatching every other fellow try to do the same thing, and not often make\nthe trip. There's millions of us--just millions--every one of us\nwith his Delkoff to sell----\" his figure of speech pleased him and he\nchuckled at his own cleverness--\"and thinking of it, and talking about\nit, and--under his vest--half afraid that he can't make it. And what\nyou say in the morning when you open your eyes and stretch yourself is,\n'Hully gee! I've GOT to sell a Delkoff to-day, and suppose I shouldn't,\nand couldn't hold down my job!' I began it over my feeding bottle. So\ndid all the people I know. That's what gave me a sort of a jolt just\nnow when I looked at you and thought about you being YOU--and what it\nmeant.\"\n\nWhen their conversation ended she had a much more intimate knowledge\nof New York than she had ever had before, and she felt it a rich\npossession. She had heard of the \"hall bedroom\" previously, and she\nhad seen from the outside the \"quick lunch\" counter, but G. Selden\nunconsciously escorted her inside and threw upon faces and lives the\nglare of a flashlight.\n\n\"There was a thing I've been thinking I'd ask you, Miss Vanderpoel,\" he\nsaid just before she left him. \"I'd like you to tell me, if you please.\nIt's like this. You see those two fellows treated me as fine as silk. I\nmean Lord Mount Dunstan and Mr. Penzance. I never expected it. I never\nsaw a lord before, much less spoke to one, but I can tell you that\none's just about all right--Mount Dunstan. And the other one--the old\nvicar--I've never taken to anyone since I was born like I took to him.\nThe way he puts on his eye-glasses and looks at you, sorter kind and\ncurious about you at the same time! And his voice and his way of saying\nhis words--well, they just GOT me--sure. And they both of 'em did say\nthey'd like to see me again. Now do you think, Miss Vanderpoel, it would\nlook too fresh--if I was to write a polite note and ask if either of\nthem could make it convenient to come and take a look at me, if it\nwouldn't be too much trouble. I don't WANT to be too fresh--and perhaps\nthey wouldn't come anyhow--and if it is, please won't you tell me, Miss\nVanderpoel?\"\n\nBetty thought of Mount Dunstan as he had stood and talked to her in\nthe deepening afternoon sun. She did not know much of him, but she\nthought--having heard G. Selden's story of the lunch--that he would\ncome. She had never seen Mr. Penzance, but she knew she should like to\nsee him.\n\n\"I think you might write the note,\" she said. \"I believe they would come\nto see you.\"\n\n\"Do you?\" with eager pleasure. \"Then I'll do it. I'd give a good deal to\nsee them again. I tell you, they are just It--both of them.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\nLIFE\n\nMount Dunstan, walking through the park next morning on his way to the\nvicarage, just after post time, met Mr. Penzance himself coming to make\nan equally early call at the Mount. Each of them had a letter in his\nhand, and each met the other's glance with a smile.\n\n\"G. Selden,\" Mount Dunstan said. \"And yours?\"\n\n\"G. Selden also,\" answered the vicar. \"Poor young fellow, what ill-luck.\nAnd yet--is it ill-luck? He says not.\"\n\n\"He tells me it is not,\" said Mount Dunstan. \"And I agree with him.\"\n\nMr. Penzance read his letter aloud.\n\n\n\"DEAR SIR:\n\n\"This is to notify you that owing to my bike going back on me when going\ndown hill, I met with an accident in Stornham Park. Was cut about the\nhead and leg broken. Little Willie being far from home and mother, you\ncan see what sort of fix he'd been in if it hadn't been for the kindness\nof Reuben S. Vanderpoel's daughters--Miss Bettina and her sister Lady\nAnstruthers. The way they've had me taken care of has been great.\nI've been under a nurse and doctor same as if I was Albert Edward with\nappendycytus (I apologise if that's not spelt right). Dear Sir, this is\nto say that I asked Miss Vanderpoel if I should be butting in too much\nif I dropped a line to ask if you could spare the time to call and see\nme. It would be considered a favour and appreciated by\n\n\"G. SELDEN,\n\n\"Delkoff Typewriter Co. Broadway.\n\n\"P. S. Have already sold three Delkoffs to Miss Vanderpoel.\"\n\n\n\"Upon my word,\" Mr. Penzance commented, and his amiable fervour quite\nglowed, \"I like that queer young fellow--I like him. He does not wish to\n'butt in too much.' Now, there is rudimentary delicacy in that. And what\na humorous, forceful figure of speech! Some butting animal--a goat, I\nseem to see, preferably--forcing its way into a group or closed circle\nof persons.\"\n\nHis gleeful analysis of the phrase had such evident charm for him that\nMount Dunstan broke into a shout of laughter, even as G. Selden had done\nat the adroit mention of Weber & Fields.\n\n\"Shall we ride over together to see him this morning? An hour with G.\nSelden, surrounded by the atmosphere of Reuben S. Vanderpoel, would be a\ncheering thing,\" he said.\n\n\"It would,\" Mr. Penzance answered. \"Let us go by all means. We\nshould not, I suppose,\" with keen delight, \"be 'butting in' upon Lady\nAnstruthers too early?\" He was quite enraptured with his own aptness.\n\"Like G. Selden, I should not like to 'butt in,'\" he added.\n\nThe scent and warmth and glow of a glorious morning filled the hour.\nCombining themselves with a certain normal human gaiety which surrounded\nthe mere thought of G. Selden, they were good things for Mount Dunstan.\nLife was strong and young in him, and he had laughed a big young laugh,\nwhich had, perhaps tended to the waking in him of the feeling he was\nsuddenly conscious of--that a six-mile ride over a white, tree-dappled,\nsunlit road would be pleasant enough, and, after all, if at the end of\nthe gallop one came again upon that other in whom life was strong and\nyoung, and bloomed on rose-cheek and was the far fire in the blue deeps\nof lovely eyes, and the slim straightness of the fair body, why would\nit not be, in a way, all to the good? He had thought of her on more than\none day, and felt that he wanted to see her again.\n\n\"Let us go,\" he answered Penzance. \"One can call on an invalid at any\ntime. Lady Anstruthers will forgive us.\"\n\nIn less than an hour's time they were on their way. They laughed and\ntalked as they rode, their horses' hoofs striking out a cheerful ringing\naccompaniment to their voices. There is nothing more exhilarating than\nthe hollow, regular ring and click-clack of good hoofs going well over\na fine old Roman road in the morning sunlight. They talked of the junior\nassistant salesman and of Miss Vanderpoel. Penzance was much pleased by\nthe prospect of seeing \"this delightful and unusual girl.\" He had heard\nstories of her, as had Lord Westholt. He knew of old Doby's pipe, and\nof Mrs. Welden's respite from the Union, and though such incidents would\nseem mere trifles to the dweller in great towns, he had himself lived\nand done his work long enough in villages to know the village mind\nand the scale of proportions by which its gladness and sadness were\nmeasured. He knew more of all this than Mount Dunstan could, since Mount\nDunstan's existence had isolated itself, from rather gloomy choice. But\nas he rode, Mount Dunstan knew that he liked to hear these things.\nThere was the suggestion of new life and new thought in them, and such\nsuggestion was good for any man--or woman, either--who had fallen into\nliving in a dull, narrow groove.\n\n\"It is the new life in her which strikes me,\" he said. \"She has brought\nwealth with her, and wealth is power to do the good or evil that grows\nin a man's soul; but she has brought something more. She might have come\nhere and brought all the sumptuousness of a fashionable young beauty,\nwho drove through the village and drew people to their windows, and made\nclodhoppers scratch their heads and pull their forelocks, and children\nbob curtsies and stare. She might have come and gone and left a\nmind-dazzling memory and nothing else. A few sovereigns tossed here\nand there would have earned her a reputation--but, by gee! to quote\nSelden--she has begun LIVING with them, as if her ancestors had done it\nfor six hundred years. And what _I_ see is that if she had come without\na penny in her pocket she would have done the same thing.\" He paused a\npondering moment, and then drew a sharp breath which was an exclamation\nin itself. \"She's Life!\" he said. \"She's Life itself! Good God! what a\nthing it is for a man or woman to be Life--instead of a mass of tissue\nand muscle and nerve, dragged about by the mere mechanism of living!\"\n\nPenzance had listened seriously.\n\n\"What you say is very suggestive,\" he commented. \"It strikes me as true,\ntoo. You have seen something of her also, at least more than I have.\"\n\n\"I did not think these things when I saw her--though I suppose I\nfelt them unconsciously. I have reached this way of summing her up by\nprocesses of exclusion and inclusion. One hears of her, as you know\nyourself, and one thinks her over.\"\n\n\"You have thought her over?\"\n\n\"A lot,\" rather grumpily. \"A beautiful female creature inevitably\ngives an unbeautiful male creature something to think of--if he is not\notherwise actively employed. I am not. She has become a sort of dawning\nrelief to my hopeless humours. Being a low and unworthy beast, I am\nsometimes resentful enough of the unfairness of things. She has too\nmuch.\"\n\nWhen they rode through Stornham village they saw signs of work already\ndone and work still in hand. There were no broken windows or palings or\nhanging wicket gates; cottage gardens had been put in order, and there\nwere evidences of such cheering touches as new bits of window curtain\nand strong-looking young plants blooming between them. So many small,\nbut necessary, things had been done that the whole village wore the\naspect of a place which had taken heart, and was facing existence in a\nhopeful spirit. A year ago Mount Dunstan and his vicar riding through it\nhad been struck by its neglected and dispirited look.\n\nAs they entered the hall of the Court Miss Vanderpoel was descending the\nstaircase. She was laughing a little to herself, and she looked pleased\nwhen she saw them.\n\n\"It is good of you to come,\" she said, as they crossed the hall to the\ndrawing-room. \"But I told him I really thought you would. I have just\nbeen talking to him, and he was a little uncertain as to whether he had\nassumed too much.\"\n\n\"As to whether he had 'butted in,'\" said Mr. Penzance. \"I think he must\nhave said that.\"\n\n\"He did. He also was afraid that he might have been 'too fresh.'\"\nanswered Betty.\n\n\"On our part,\" said Mr. Penzance, with gentle glee, \"we hesitated a\nmoment in fear lest we also might appear to be 'butting in.'\"\n\nThen they all laughed together. They were laughing when Lady Anstruthers\nentered, and she herself joined them. But to Mount Dunstan, who felt her\nto be somehow a touching little person, there was manifest a tenderness\nin her feeling for G. Selden. For that matter, however, there was\nsomething already beginning to be rather affectionate in the attitude of\neach of them. They went upstairs to find him lying in state upon a\nbig sofa placed near a window, and his joy at the sight of them was a\ngenuine, human thing. In fact, he had pondered a good deal in secret\non the possibility of these swell people thinking he had \"more than his\nshare of gall\" to expect them to remember him after he passed on his\njunior assistant salesman's way. Reuben S. Vanderpoel's daughters\nwere of the highest of his Four Hundred, but they were Americans, and\nAmericans were not as a rule so \"stuck on themselves\" as the English.\nAnd here these two swells came as friendly as you please. And that nice\nold chap that was a vicar, smiling and giving him \"the glad hand\"!\n\nBetty and Mount Dunstan left Mr. Penzance talking to the convalescent\nafter a short time. Mount Dunstan had asked to be shown the gardens. He\nwanted to see the wonderful things he had heard had been already done to\nthem.\n\nThey went down the stairs together and passed through the drawing-room\ninto the pleasure grounds. The once neglected lawns had already been\nmown and rolled, clipped and trimmed, until they spread before the eye\nhuge measures of green velvet; even the beds girdling and adorning them\nwere brilliant with flowers.\n\n\"Kedgers!\" said Betty, waving her hand. \"In my ignorance I thought we\nmust wait for blossoms until next year; but it appears that wonders can\nbe brought all ready to bloom for one from nursery gardens, and can be\nmade to grow with care--and daring--and passionate affection. I\nhave seen Kedgers turn pale with anguish as he hung over a bed of\ntransplanted things which seemed to droop too long. They droop just at\nfirst, you know, and then they slowly lift their heads, slowly, as if\nto listen to a Voice calling--calling. Once I sat for quite a long time\nbefore a rose, watching it. When I saw it BEGIN to listen, I felt a\nlittle trembling pass over my body. I seemed to be so strangely near to\nsuch a strange thing. It was Life--Life coming back--in answer to what\nwe cannot hear.\"\n\nShe had begun lightly, and then her voice had changed. It was very\nquiet at the end of her speaking. Mount Dunstan simply repeated her last\nwords.\n\n\"To what we cannot hear.\"\n\n\"One feels it so much in a garden,\" she said. \"I have never lived in a\ngarden of my own. This is not mine, but I have been living in it--with\nKedgers. One is so close to Life in it--the stirring in the brown earth,\nthe piercing through of green spears, that breaking of buds and pouring\nforth of scent! Why shouldn't one tremble, if one thinks? I have stood\nin a potting shed and watched Kedgers fill a shallow box with damp rich\nmould and scatter over it a thin layer of infinitesimal seeds; then he\nmoistens them and carries them reverently to his altars in a greenhouse.\nThe ledges in Kedgers' green-houses are altars. I think he offers\nprayers before them. Why not? I should. And when one comes to see them,\nthe moist seeds are swelled to fulness, and when one comes again they\nare bursting. And the next time, tiny green things are curling outward.\nAnd, at last, there is a fairy forest of tiniest pale green stems and\nleaves. And one is standing close to the Secret of the World! And why\nshould not one prostrate one's self, breathing softly--and touching\none's awed forehead to the earth?\"\n\nMount Dunstan turned and looked at her--a pause in his step--they were\nwalking down a turfed path, and over their heads meeting branches of\nnew leaves hung. Something in his movement made her turn and pause also.\nThey both paused--and quite unknowingly.\n\n\"Do you know,\" he said, in a low and rather unusual voice, \"that as\nwe were on our way here, I said of you to Penzance, that you were\nLife--YOU!\"\n\nFor a few seconds, as they stood so, his look held her--their eyes\ninvoluntarily and strangely held each other. Something softly glowing in\nthe sunlight falling on them both, something raining down in the song\nof a rising skylark trilling in the blue a field away, something in the\nwarmed incense of blossoms near them, was calling--calling in the Voice,\nthough they did not know they heard. Strangely, a splendid blush rose\nin a fair flood under her skin. She was conscious of it, and felt a\nsecond's amazed impatience that she should colour like a schoolgirl\nsuspecting a compliment. He did not look at her as a man looks who has\nmade a pretty speech. His eyes met hers straight and thoughtfully, and\nhe repeated his last words as he had before repeated hers.\n\n\"That YOU were Life--you!\"\n\nThe bluebells under water were for the moment incredibly lovely. Her\nfeeling about the blush melted away as the blush itself had done.\n\n\"I am glad you said that!\" she answered. \"It was a beautiful thing to\nsay. I have often thought that I should like it to be true.\"\n\n\"It is true,\" he said.\n\nThen the skylark, showering golden rain, swept down to earth and its\nnest in the meadow, and they walked on.\n\nShe learned from him, as they walked together, and he also learned from\nher, in a manner which built for them as they went from point to point,\na certain degree of delicate intimacy, gradually, during their ramble,\ntending to make discussion and question possible. Her intelligent and\nbroad interest in the work on the estate, her frank desire to acquire\nsuch practical information as she lacked, aroused in himself an interest\nhe had previously seen no reason that he should feel. He realised that\nhis outlook upon the unusual situation was being illuminated by an\nintelligence at once brilliant and fine, while it was also full of\nnice shading. The situation, of course, WAS unusual. A beautiful young\nsister-in-law appearing upon the dark horizon of a shamefully ill-used\nestate, and restoring, with touches of a wand of gold, what a fellow\nwho was a blackguard should have set in order years ago. That Lady\nAnstruthers' money should have rescued her boy's inheritance instead\nof being spent upon lavish viciousness went without saying. What\nMount Dunstan was most struck by was the perfect clearness, and its\ncombination with a certain judicial good breeding, in Miss Vanderpoel's\nview of the matter. She made no confidences, beautifully candid as her\nmanner was, but he saw that she clearly understood the thing she was\ndoing, and that if her sister had had no son she would not have\ndone this, but something totally different. He had an idea that Lady\nAnstruthers would have been swiftly and lightly swept back to New York,\nand Sir Nigel left to his own devices, in which case Stornham Court\nand its village would gradually have crumbled to decay. It was for Sir\nUghtred Anstruthers the place was being restored. She was quite clear on\nthe matter of entail. He wondered at first--not unnaturally--how a girl\nhad learned certain things she had an obviously clear knowledge of. As\nthey continued to converse he learned. Reuben S. Vanderpoel was without\ndoubt a man remarkable not only in the matter of being the owner of vast\nwealth. The rising flood of his millions had borne him upon its strange\nsurface a thinking, not an unthinking being--in fact, a strong and\nfine intelligence. His thousands of miles of yearly journeying in his\nsumptuous private car had been the means of his accumulating not merely\nadded gains, but ideas, points of view, emotions, a human outlook worth\ncounting as an asset. His daughter, when she had travelled with him, had\nseen and talked with him of all he himself had seen. When she had not\nbeen his companion she had heard from him afterwards all best worth\nhearing. She had become--without any special process--familiar with\nthe technicalities of huge business schemes, with law and commerce\nand political situations. Even her childish interest in the world\nof enterprise and labour had been passionate. So she had\nacquired--inevitably, while almost unconsciously--a remarkable\neducation.\n\n\"If he had not been HIMSELF he might easily have grown tired of a little\ngirl constantly wanting to hear things--constantly asking questions,\"\nshe said. \"But he did not get tired. We invented a special knock on the\ndoor of his private room. It said, 'May I come in, father?' If he was\nbusy he answered with one knock on his desk, and I went away. If he had\ntime to talk he called out, 'Come, Betty,' and I went to him. I used to\nsit upon the floor and lean against his knee. He had a beautiful way of\nstroking my hair or my hand as he talked. He trusted me. He told me of\ngreat things even before he had talked of them to men. He knew I would\nnever speak of what was said between us in his room. That was part of\nhis trust. He said once that it was a part of the evolution of race,\nthat men had begun to expect of women what in past ages they really only\nexpected of each other.\"\n\nMount Dunstan hesitated before speaking.\n\n\"You mean--absolute faith--apart from affection?\"\n\n\"Yes. The power to be quite silent, even when one is tempted to\nspeak--if to speak might betray what it is wiser to keep to one's self\nbecause it is another man's affair. The kind of thing which is good\nfaith among business men. It applies to small things as much as to\nlarge, and to other things than business.\"\n\nMount Dunstan, recalling his own childhood and his own father, felt\nagain the pressure of the remote mental suggestion that she had had\ntoo much, a childhood and girlhood like this, the affection and\ncompanionship of a man of large and ordered intelligence, of clear and\njudicial outlook upon an immense area of life and experience. There was\nno cause for wonder that her young womanhood was all it presented to\nhimself, as well as to others. Recognising the shadow of resentment in\nhis thought, he swept it away, an inward sense making it clear to him\nthat if their positions had been reversed, she would have been more\ngenerous than himself.\n\nHe pulled himself together with an unconscious movement of his\nshoulders. Here was the day of early June, the gold of the sun in\nits morning, the green shadows, the turf they walked on together, the\nskylark rising again from the meadow and showering down its song. Why\nthink of anything else. What a line that was which swept from her chin\ndown her long slim throat to its hollow! The colour between the velvet\nof her close-set lashes--the remembrance of her curious splendid\nblush--made the man's lost and unlived youth come back to him. What\ndid it matter whether she was American or English--what did it matter\nwhether she was insolently rich or beggarly poor? He would let himself\ngo and forget all but the pleasure of the sight and hearing of her.\n\nSo as they went they found themselves laughing together and talking\nwithout restraint. They went through the flower and kitchen gardens;\nthey saw the once fallen wall rebuilt now with the old brick; they\nvisited the greenhouses and came upon Kedgers entranced with business,\nbut enraptured at being called upon to show his treasures. His eyes,\nturning magnetised upon Betty, revealed the story of his soul. Mount\nDunstan remarked that when he spoke to her of his flowers it was as\nif there existed between them the sympathy which might be engendered\nbetween two who had sat up together night after night with delicate\nchildren.\n\n\"He's stronger to-day, miss,\" he said, as they paused before a new\nwonderful bloom. \"What he's getting now is good for him. I had to change\nhis food, miss, but this seems all right. His colour's better.\"\n\nBetty herself bent over the flower as she might have bent over a child.\nHer eyes softened, she touched a leaf with a slim finger, as delicately\nas if it had been a new-born baby's cheek. As Mount Dunstan watched her\nhe drew a step nearer to her side. For the first time in his life\nhe felt the glow of a normal and simple pleasure untouched by any\nbitterness.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\nSETTING THEM THINKING\n\nOld Doby, sitting at his open window, with his pipe and illustrated\npapers on the table by his side, began to find life a series of thrills.\nThe advantage of a window giving upon the village street unspeakably\nincreased. For many years he had preferred the chimney corner greatly,\nand had rejoiced at the drawing in of winter days when a fire must be\nwell kept up, and a man might bend over it, and rub his hands slowly\ngazing into the red coals or little pointed flames which seemed the only\nthings alive and worthy the watching. The flames were blue at the base\nand yellow at the top, and jumped looking merry, and caught at bits of\nblack coal, and set them crackling and throwing off splinters till they\nwere ablaze and as much alive as the rest. A man could get comfort and\nentertainment therefrom. There was naught else so good to live with.\nNothing happened in the street, and every dull face that passed was an\nold story, and told an old tale of stupefying hard labour and hard days.\n\nBut now the window was a better place to sit near. Carts went by with\nmen whistling as they walked by the horses heads. Loads of things wanted\nfor work at the Court. New faces passed faces of workmen--sometimes\ngrinning, \"impident youngsters,\" who larked with the young women, and\ncalled out to them as they passed their cottages, if a good-looking\none was loitering about her garden gate. Old Doby chuckled at their\nlove-making chaff, remembering dimly that seventy years ago he had been\njust as proper a young chap, and had made love in the same way. Lord,\nLord, yes! He had been a bold young chap as ever winked an eye. Then,\ntoo, there were the vans, heavy-loaded and closed, and coming along\nslowly. Every few days, at first, there had come a van from \"Lunnon.\"\nGoing to the Court, of course. And to sit there, and hear the women talk\nabout what might be in them, and to try to guess one's self, that was a\nrare pastime. Fine things going to the Court these days--furniture and\ngrandeur filling up the shabby or empty old rooms, and making them look\nlike other big houses--same as Westerbridge even, so the women said.\nThe women were always talking and getting bits of news somehow, and\nwere beginning to be worth listening to, because they had something more\ninteresting to talk about than children's worn-out shoes, and whooping\ncough.\n\nDoby heard everything first from them. \"Dang the women, they always\nknowed things fust.\" It was them as knowed about the smart carriages\nas began to roll through the one village street. They were gentry's\ncarriages, with fine, stamping horses, and jingling silver harness, and\nbig coachmen, and tall footmen, and such like had long ago dropped off\nshowing themselves at Stornham.\n\n\"But now the gentry has heard about Miss Vanderpoel, and what's being\ndone at the Court, and they know what it means,\" said young Mrs. Doby.\n\"And they want to see her, and find out what she's like. It's her brings\nthem.\"\n\nOld Doby chuckled and rubbed his hands. He knew what she was like. That\nstraight, slim back of hers, and the thick twist of black hair, and the\nway she had of laughing at you, as cheery as if a bell was ringing. Aye,\nhe knew all about that.\n\n\"When they see her once, they'll come agen, for sure,\" he quavered\nshrilly, and day by day he watched for the grand carriages with vivid\neagerness. If a day or two passed without his seeing one, he grew\nfretful, and was injured, feeling that his beauty was being neglected!\n\"None to-day, nor yet yest'day,\" he would cackle. \"What be they folk\na-doin'?\"\n\nOld Mrs. Welden, having heard of the pipe, and come to see it, had\nstruck up an acquaintance with him, and dropped in almost every day to\ntalk and sit at his window. She was a young thing, by comparison, and\ncould bring him lively news, and, indeed, so stir him up with her gossip\nthat he was in danger of becoming a young thing himself. Her groceries\nand his tobacco were subjects whose interest was undying.\n\nA great curiosity had been awakened in the county, and visitors came\nfrom distances greater than such as ordinarily include usual calls.\nNaturally, one was curious about the daughter of the Vanderpoel who was\na sort of national institution in his own country. His name had not been\nso much heard of in England when Lady Anstruthers had arrived but\nthere had, at first, been felt an interest in her. But she had been a\nfailure--a childish-looking girl--whose thin, fair, prettiness had no\ndistinction, and who was obviously overwhelmed by her surroundings. She\nhad evidently had no influence over Sir Nigel, and had not been able to\nprevent his making ducks and drakes of her money, which of course\nought to have been spent on the estate. Besides which a married woman\nrepresented fewer potentialities than a handsome unmarried girl entitled\nto expectations from huge American wealth.\n\nSo the carriages came and came again, and, stately or unstately far-off\nneighbours sat at tea upon the lawn under the trees, and it was observed\nthat the methods and appointments of the Court had entirely changed.\nNothing looked new and American. The silently moving men-servants\ncould not have been improved upon, there was plainly an excellent\nchef somewhere, and the massive silver was old and wonderful. Upon\neverybody's word, the change was such as it was worth a long drive\nmerely to see!\n\nThe most wonderful thing, however, was Lady Anstruthers herself. She\nhad begun to grow delicately plump, her once drawn and haggard face had\nrounded out, her skin had smoothed, and was actually becoming pink and\nfair, a nimbus of pale fine hair puffed airily over her forehead, and\nshe wore the most charming little clothes, all of which made her look\nfifteen years younger than she had seemed when, on the grounds of\nill-health, she had retired into seclusion. The renewed relations with\nher family, the atmosphere by which she was surrounded, had evidently\ngiven her a fresh lease of life, and awakened in her a new courage.\n\nWhen the summer epidemic of garden parties broke forth, old Doby\ngleefully beheld, day after day, the Court carriage drive by bearing her\nladyship and her sister attired in fairest shades and tints \"same as if\nthey was flowers.\" Their delicate vaporousness, and rare colours,\nwere sweet delights to the old man, and he and Mrs. Welden spent happy\nevenings discussing them as personal possessions. To these two Betty WAS\na personal possession, bestowing upon them a marked distinction. They\nwere hers and she was theirs. No one else so owned her. Heaven had given\nher to them that their last years might be lighted with splendour.\n\nOn her way to one of the garden parties she stopped the carriage before\nold Doby's cottage, and went in to him to speak a few words. She was of\npale convolvulus blue that afternoon, and Doby, standing up touching his\nforelock and Mrs. Welden curtsying, gazed at her with prayer in\ntheir eyes. She had a few flowers in her hand, and a book of coloured\nphotographs of Venice.\n\n\"These are pictures of the city I told you about--the city built in the\nsea--where the streets are water. You and Mrs. Welden can look at them\ntogether,\" she said, as she laid flowers and book down. \"I am going to\nDunholm Castle to a garden party this afternoon. Some day I will come\nand tell you about it.\"\n\nThe two were at the window staring spellbound, as she swept back to the\ncarriage between the sweet-williams and Canterbury bells bordering the\nnarrow garden path.\n\n\"Do you know I really went in to let them see my dress,\" she said, when\nshe rejoined Lady Anstruthers. \"Old Doby's granddaughter told me that he\nand Mrs. Welden have little quarrels about the colours I wear. It seems\nthat they find my wardrobe an absorbing interest. When I put the book on\nthe table, I felt Doby touch my sleeve with his trembling old hand. He\nthought I did not know.\"\n\n\"What will they do with Venice?\" asked Rosy.\n\n\"They will believe the water is as blue as the photographs make it--and\nthe palaces as pink. It will seem like a chapter out of Revelations,\nwhich they can believe is true and not merely 'Scriptur,'--because _I_\nhave been there. I wish I had been to the City of the Gates of Pearl,\nand could tell them about that.\"\n\nOn the lawns at the garden parties she was much gazed at and commented\nupon. Her height and her long slender neck held her head above those of\nother girls, the dense black of her hair made a rich note of shadow amid\nthe prevailing English blondness. Her mere colouring set her apart.\nRosy used to watch her with tender wonder, recalling her memory of\nnine-year-old Betty, with the long slim legs and the demanding and\naccusing child-eyes. She had always been this creature even in those\nfar-off days. At the garden party at Dunholm Castle it became evident\nthat she was, after a manner, unusually the central figure of the\noccasion. It was not at all surprising, people said to each other.\nNothing could have been more desirable for Lord Westholt. He combined\nrank with fortune, and the Vanderpoel wealth almost constituted rank in\nitself. Both Lord and Lady Dunholm seemed pleased with the girl. Lord\nDunholm showed her great attention. When she took part in the dancing\non the lawn, he looked on delightedly. He walked about the gardens\nwith her, and it was plain to see that their conversation was not the\nordinary polite effort to accord, usually marking the talk between a\nmature man and a merely pretty girl. Lord Dunholm sometimes laughed with\nunfeigned delight, and sometimes the two seemed to talk of grave things.\n\n\"Such occasions as these are a sort of yearly taking of the social\ncensus of the county,\" Lord Dunholm explained. \"One invites ALL one's\nneighbours and is invited again. It is a friendly duty one owes.\"\n\n\"I do not see Lord Mount Dunstan,\" Betty answered. \"Is he here?\"\n\nShe had never denied to herself her interest in Mount Dunstan, and she\nhad looked for him. Lord Dunholm hesitated a second, as his son had done\nat Miss Vanderpoel's mention of the tabooed name. But, being an older\nman, he felt more at liberty to speak, and gave her a rather long kind\nlook.\n\n\"My dear young lady,\" he said, \"did you expect to see him here?\"\n\n\"Yes, I think I did,\" Betty replied, with slow softness. \"I believe I\nrather hoped I should.\"\n\n\"Indeed! You are interested in him?\"\n\n\"I know him very little. But I am interested. I will tell you why.\"\n\nShe paused by a seat beneath a tree, and they sat down together.\nShe gave, with a few swift vivid touches, a sketch of the red-haired\nsecond-class passenger on the Meridiana, of whom she had only thought\nthat he was an unhappy, rough-looking young man, until the brief moment\nin which they had stood face to face, each comprehending that the other\nwas to be relied on if the worst should come to the worst. She had\nunderstood his prompt disappearance from the scene, and had liked it.\nWhen she related the incident of her meeting with him when she thought\nhim a mere keeper on his own lands, Lord Dunholm listened with a changed\nand thoughtful expression. The effect produced upon her imagination by\nwhat she had seen, her silent wandering through the sad beauty of the\nwronged place, led by the man who tried stiffly to bear himself as a\nservant, his unintended self-revelations, her clear, well-argued point\nof view charmed him. She had seen the thing set apart from its county\nscandal, and so had read possibilities others had been blind to. He was\nimmensely touched by certain things she said about the First Man.\n\n\"He is one of them,\" she said. \"They find their way in the end--they\nfind their way. But just now he thinks there is none. He is standing in\nthe dark--where the roads meet.\"\n\n\"You think he will find his way?\" Lord Dunholm said. \"Why do you think\nso?\"\n\n\"Because I KNOW he will,\" she answered. \"But I cannot tell you WHY I\nknow.\"\n\n\"What you have said has been interesting to me, because of the light\nyour own thought threw upon what you saw. It has not been Mount Dunstan\nI have been caring for, but for the light you saw him in. You met him\nwithout prejudice, and you carried the light in your hand. You always\ncarry a light, my impression is,\" very quietly. \"Some women do.\"\n\n\"The prejudice you speak of must be a bitter thing for a proud man to\nbear. Is it a just prejudice? What has he done?\"\n\nLord Dunholm was gravely silent for a few moments.\n\n\"It is an extraordinary thing to reflect,\"--his words came slowly--\"that\nit may NOT be a just prejudice. _I_ do not know that he has done\nanything--but seem rather sulky, and be the son of his father, and the\nbrother of his brother.\"\n\n\"And go to America,\" said Betty. \"He could have avoided doing that--but\nhe cannot be called to account for his relations. If that is all--the\nprejudice is NOT just.\"\n\n\"No, it is not,\" said Lord Dunholm, \"and one feels rather awkward at\nhaving shared it. You have set me thinking again, Miss Vanderpoel.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\nTHE THREAD OF G. SELDEN\n\nThe Shuttle having in its weaving caught up the thread of G. Selden's\nrudimentary existence and drawn it, with the young man himself, across\nthe sea, used curiously the thread in question, in the forming of\nthe design of its huge web. As wool and coarse linen are sometimes\ninterwoven with rich silk for decorative or utilitarian purposes, so\nperhaps was this previously unvalued material employed.\n\nIt was, indeed, an interesting truth that the young man, during his\nconvalescence, without his own knowledge, acted as a species of magnet\nwhich drew together persons who might not easily otherwise have met.\nMr. Penzance and Mount Dunstan rode over to see him every few days, and\ntheir visits naturally established relations with Stornham Court much\nmore intimate than could have formed themselves in the same length\nof time under any of the ordinary circumstances of country life.\nConventionalities lost their prominence in friendly intercourse with\nSelden. It was not, however, that he himself desired to dispense with\nconvention. His intense wish to \"do the right thing,\" and avoid giving\noffence was the most ingenuous and touching feature of his broad\ncosmopolitan good nature.\n\n\"If I ever make a break, sir,\" he had once said, with almost passionate\nfervour, in talking to Mr. Penzance, \"please tell me, and set me on the\nright track. No fellow likes to look like a hoosier, but I don't mind\nthat half as much as--as seeming not to APPRECIATE.\"\n\nHe used the word \"appreciate\" frequently. It expressed for him many\ndegrees of thanks.\n\n\"I tell you that's fine,\" he said to Ughtred, who brought him a flower\nfrom the garden. \"I appreciate that.\"\n\nTo Betty he said more than once:\n\n\"You know how I appreciate all this, Miss Vanderpoel. You DO know I\nappreciate it, don't you?\"\n\nHe had an immense admiration for Mount Dunstan, and talked to him a\ngreat deal about America, often about the sheep ranch, and what it might\nhave done and ought to have done. But his admiration for Mr. Penzance\nbecame affection. To him he talked oftener about England, and listened\nto the vicar's scholarly stories of its history, its past glories and\nits present ones, as he might have listened at fourteen to stories from\nthe Arabian Nights.\n\nThese two being frequently absorbed in conversation, Mount Dunstan was\nrather thrown upon Betty's hands. When they strolled together about the\nplace or sat under the deep shade of green trees, they talked not only\nof England and America, but of divers things which increased their\nknowledge of each other. It is points of view which reveal qualities,\ntendencies, and innate differences, or accordances of thought, and the\npoints of view of each interested the other.\n\n\"Mr. Selden is asking Mr. Penzance questions about English history,\"\nBetty said, on one of the afternoons in which they sat in the shade. \"I\nneed not ask you questions. You ARE English history.\"\n\n\"And you are American history,\" Mount Dunstan answered.\n\n\"I suppose I am.\"\n\nAt one of their chance meetings Miss Vanderpoel had told Lord Dunholm\nand Lord Westholt something of the story of G. Selden. The novelty of it\nhad delighted and amused them. Lord Dunholm had, at points, been touched\nas Penzance had been. Westholt had felt that he must ride over to\nStornham to see the convalescent. He wanted to learn some New York\nslang.\n\nHe would take lessons from Selden, and he would also buy a Delkoff--two\nDelkoffs, if that would be better. He knew a hard-working fellow who\nought to have a typewriter.\n\n\"Heath ought to have one,\" he had said to his father. Heath was the\nhouse-steward. \"Think of the letters the poor chap has to write to\ntrades-people to order things, and unorder them, and blackguard the\nshopkeepers when they are not satisfactory. Invest in one for Heath,\nfather.\"\n\n\"It is by no means a bad idea,\" Lord Dunholm reflected. \"Time would be\nsaved by the use of it, I have no doubt.\"\n\n\"It saves time in any department where it can be used,\" Betty had\nanswered. \"Three are now in use at Stornham, and I am going to present\none to Kedgers. This is a testimonial I am offering. Three weeks ago I\nbegan to use the Delkoff. Since then I have used no other. If YOU use\nthem you will introduce them to the county.\"\n\nShe understood the feeling of the junior assistant, when he found\nhimself in the presence of possible purchasers. Her blood tingled\nslightly. She wished she had brought a catalogue.\n\n\"We will come to Stornham to see the catalogue,\" Lord Dunholm promised.\n\n\"Perhaps you will read it aloud to us,\" Westholt suggested gleefully.\n\n\"G. Selden knows it by heart, and will repeat it to you with running\ncomments. Do you know I shall be very glad if you decide to buy one--or\ntwo--or three,\" with an uplift of the Irish blue eyes to Lord Dunholm.\n\"The blood of the first Reuben Vanderpoel stirs in my veins--also I have\nbegun to be fond of G. Selden.\"\n\nTherefore it occurred that on the afternoon referred to Lady Anstruthers\nappeared crossing the sward with two male visitors in her wake.\n\n\"Lord Dunholm and Lord Westholt,\" said Betty, rising.\n\nFor this meeting between the men Selden was, without doubt, responsible.\nWhile his father talked to Mount Dunstan, Westholt explained that they\nhad come athirst for the catalogue. Presently Betty took him to the\nsheltered corner of the lawn, where the convalescent sat with Mr.\nPenzance.\n\nBut, for a short time, Lord Dunholm remained to converse with Mount\nDunstan. In a way the situation was delicate. To encounter by chance a\nneighbour whom one--for reasons--has not seen since his childhood, and\nto be equal to passing over and gracefully obliterating the intervening\nyears, makes demand even upon finished tact. Lord Dunholm's world\nhad been a large one, and he had acquired experience tending to the\ndevelopment of the most perfect methods. If G. Selden had chanced to\nbe the magnet which had decided his course this special afternoon, Miss\nVanderpoel it was who had stirred in him sufficient interest in Mount\nDunstan to cause him to use the best of these methods when he found\nhimself face to face with him.\n\nHe beautifully eliminated the years, he eliminated all but the facts\nthat the young man's father and himself had been acquaintances in youth,\nthat he remembered Mount Dunstan himself as a child, that he had heard\nwith interest of his visit to America. Whatsoever the young man felt,\nhe made no sign which presented obstacles. He accepted the eliminations\nwith outward composure. He was a powerful-looking fellow, with a fine\nway of carrying his shoulders, and an eye which might be able to light\nsavagely, but just now, at least, he showed nothing of the sulkiness he\nwas accused of.\n\nLord Dunholm progressed admirably with him. He soon found that he need\nnot be upon any strain with regard to the eliminations. The man himself\ncould eliminate, which was an assistance.\n\nThey talked together when they turned to follow the others to the\nretreat of G. Selden.\n\n\"Have you bought a Delkoff?\" Lord Dunholm inquired.\n\n\"If I could have afforded it, I should have bought one.\"\n\n\"I think that we have come here with the intention of buying three. We\ndid not know we required them until Miss Vanderpoel recited half a page\nof the catalogue to us.\"\n\n\"Three will mean a 'rake off' of fifteen dollars to G. Selden,\" said\nMount Dunstan. It was, he saw, necessary that he should explain the\nmeaning of a \"rake off,\" and he did so to his companion's entertainment.\n\nThe afternoon was a satisfactory one. They were all kind to G. Selden,\nand he on his part was an aid to them. In his innocence he steered\nthree of them, at least, through narrow places into an open sea of\neasy intercourse. This was a good beginning. The junior assistant was\nrecovering rapidly, and looked remarkably well. The doctor had told him\nthat he might try to use his leg. The inside cabin of the cheap Liner\nand \"little old New York\" were looming up before him. But what luck he\nhad had, and what a holiday! It had been enough to set a fellow up for\nten years' work. It would set up the boys merely to be told about it. He\ndidn't know what HE had ever done to deserve such luck as had happened\nto him. For the rest of his life he would he waving the Union Jack\nalongside of the Stars and Stripes.\n\nMr. Penzance it was who suggested that he should try the strength of the\nleg now.\n\n\"Yes,\" Mount Dunstan said. \"Let me help you.\"\n\nAs he rose to go to him, Westholt good-naturedly got up also. They took\ntheir places at either side of his invalid chair and assisted him to\nrise and stand on his feet.\n\n\"It's all right, gentlemen. It's all right,\" he called out with a\ndelighted flush, when he found himself upright. \"I believe I could stand\nalone. Thank you. Thank you.\"\n\nHe was able, leaning on Mount Dunstan's arm, to take a few steps.\nEvidently, in a short time, he would find himself no longer disabled.\n\nMr. Penzance had invited him to spend a week at the vicarage. He was to\ndo this as soon as he could comfortably drive from the one place to the\nother. After receiving the invitation he had sent secretly to London for\none of the Delkoffs he had brought with him from America as a specimen.\nHe cherished in private a plan of gently entertaining his host by\nteaching him to use the machine. The vicar would thus be prepared for\nthat future in which surely a Delkoff must in some way fall into his\nhands. Indeed, Fortune having at length cast an eye on himself, might\nchance to favour him further, and in time he might be able to send a\n\"high-class machine\" as a grateful gift to the vicarage. Perhaps Mr.\nPenzance would accept it because he would understand what it meant of\nfeeling and appreciation.\n\nDuring the afternoon Lord Dunholm managed to talk a good deal with\nMount Dunstan. There was no air of intention in his manner, nevertheless\nintention was concealed beneath its courteous amiability. He wanted\nto get at the man. Before they parted he felt he had, perhaps, learned\nthings opening up new points of view.\n\n. . . . .\n\nIn the smoking-room at Dunholm that night he and his son talked of their\nchance encounter. It seemed possible that mistakes had been made about\nMount Dunstan. One did not form a definite idea of a man's character\nin the course of an afternoon, but he himself had been impressed by a\nconviction that there had been mistakes.\n\n\"We are rather a stiff-necked lot--in the country--when we allow\nourselves to be taken possession of by an idea,\" Westholt commented.\n\n\"I am not at all proud of the way in which we have taken things\nfor granted,\" was his father's summing up. \"It is, perhaps, worth\nobserving,\" taking his cigar from his mouth and smiling at the end of\nit, as he removed the ash, \"that, but for Miss Vanderpoel and G. Selden,\nwe might never have had an opportunity of facing the fact that we may\nnot have been giving fair play. And one has prided one's self on one's\nfair play.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\nA RETURN\n\nAt the close of a long, warm afternoon Betty Vanderpoel came out upon\nthe square stone terrace overlooking the gardens, and that part of\nthe park which, enclosing them, caused them, as they melted into its\ngreenness, to lose all limitations and appear to be only a more blooming\nbit of the landscape.\n\nUpon the garden Betty's eyes dwelt, as she stood still for some minutes\ntaking in their effect thoughtfully.\n\nKedgers had certainly accomplished much. His close-trimmed lawns did\nhim credit, his flower beds were flushed and azured, purpled and snowed\nwith bloom. Sweet tall spires, hung with blue or white or rosy flower\nbells, lifted their heads above the colour of lower growths. Only the\nfervent affection, the fasting and prayer of a Kedgers could have done\nsuch wonders with new things and old. The old ones he had cherished and\nallured into a renewal of existence--the new ones he had so coaxed out\nof their earthen pots into the soil, luxuriously prepared for their\nreception, and had afterwards so nourished and bedewed with soft\nwaterings, so supported, watched over and adored that they had been\nalmost unconscious of their transplanting. Without assistants he could\nhave done nothing, but he had been given a sufficient number of under\ngardeners, and had even managed to inspire them with something of his\nown ambition and solicitude. The result was before Betty's eyes in\nan aspect which, to such as knew the gardens well,--the Dunholms, for\ninstance,--was astonishing in its success.\n\n\"I've had privileges, miss, and so have the flowers,\" Kedgers had said\nwarmly, when Miss Vanderpoel had reported to him, for his encouragement,\nDunholm Castle's praise. \"Not one of 'em has ever had to wait for\nhis food and drink, nor to complain of his bed not being what he was\naccustomed to. They've not had to wait for rain, for we've given it to\n'em from watering cans, and, thank goodness, the season's been kind to\n'em.\"\n\nBetty, descending the terrace steps, wandered down the paths between\nthe flower beds, glancing about her as she went. The air of neglect and\ndesolation had been swept away. Buttle and Tim Soames had been given\nas many privileges as Kedgers. The chief points impressed upon them had\nbeen that the work must be done, not only thoroughly, but quickly. As\nmany additional workmen as they required, as much solid material as they\nneeded, but there must be a despatch which at first it staggered them\nto contemplate. They had not known such methods before. They had been\naccustomed to work under money limitation throughout their lives, and,\nwhen work must be done with insufficient aid, it must be done slowly.\nEconomy had been the chief factor in all calculations, speed had not\nentered into them, so leisureliness had become a fixed habit. But it\nseemed American to sweep leisureliness away into space with a free\ngesture.\n\n\"It must be done QUICKLY,\" Miss Vanderpoel had said. \"If ten men cannot\ndo it quickly enough, you must have twenty--or as many more as are\nneeded. It is time which must be saved just now.\"\n\nTime more than money, it appeared. Buttle's experience had been that you\nmight take time, if you did not charge for it. When time began to mean\nmoney, that was a different matter. If you did work by the job, you\nmight drive in a few nails, loiter, and return without haste; if you\nworked by the hour, your absence would be inquired into. In the present\ncase no one could loiter. That was realised early. The tall girl, with\nthe deep straight look at you, made you realise that without spoken\nwords. She expected energy something like her own. She was a new force\nand spurred them. No man knew how it was done, but, when she appeared\namong them--even in the afternoon--\"lookin' that womany,\" holding up\nher thin dress over lace petticoats, the like of which had not been seen\nbefore, she looked on with just the same straight, expecting eyes.\nThey did not seem to doubt in the least that she would find that great\nadvance had been made.\n\nSo advance had been made, and work accomplished. As Betty walked from\none place to another she saw the signs of it with gratification. The\nplace was not the one she had come to a few months ago. Hothouses,\noutbuildings, stables were in repair. Work was still being done in\ndifferent places. In the house itself carpenters or decorators were\nenclosed in some rooms, and at their business, but exterior order\nprevailed. In the courtyard stablemen were at work, and her own groom\ncame forward touching his forehead. She paid a visit to the horses. They\nwere fine creatures, and, when she entered their stalls, made room for\nher and whinnied gently, in well-founded expectation of sugar and bread\nwhich were kept in a cupboard awaiting her visits. She smoothed velvet\nnoses and patted satin sides, talking to Mason a little before she went\nher way.\n\nThen she strolled into the park. The park was always a pleasure. She was\nin a thoughtful mood, and the soft green shadowed silence lured her. The\nsummer wind hus-s-shed the branches as it lightly waved them, the brown\nearth of the avenue was sun-dappled, there were bird notes and calls\nto be heard here and there and everywhere, if one only arrested one's\nattention a moment to listen. And she was in a listening and dreaming\nmood--one of the moods in which bird, leaf, and wind, sun, shade, and\nscent of growing things have part.\n\nAnd yet her thoughts were of mundane things.\n\nIt was on this avenue that G. Selden had met with his accident. He was\nstill at Dunstan vicarage, and yesterday Mount Dunstan, in calling, had\ntold them that Mr. Penzance was applying himself with delighted interest\nto a study of the manipulation of the Delkoff.\n\nThe thought of Mount Dunstan brought with it the thought of her father.\nThis was because there was frequently in her mind a connection between\nthe two. How would the man of schemes, of wealth, and power almost\nunbounded, regard the man born with a load about his neck--chained\nto earth by it, standing in the midst of his hungering and thirsting\npossessions, his hands empty of what would feed them and restore their\nstrength? Would he see any solution of the problem? She could\nimagine his looking at the situation through his gaze at the man, and\nconsidering both in his summing up.\n\n\"Circumstances and the man,\" she had heard him say. \"But always the man\nfirst.\"\n\nBeing no visionary, he did not underestimate the power of circumstance.\nThis Betty had learned from him. And what could practically be done with\ncircumstance such as this? The question had begun to recur to her. What\ncould she herself have done in the care of Rosy and Stornham, if\nchance had not placed in her hand the strongest lever? What she had\naccomplished had been easy--easy. All that had been required had been\nthe qualities which control of the lever might itself tend to create in\none. Given--by mere chance again--imagination and initiative, the moving\nof the lever did the rest. If chance had not been on one's side, what\nthen? And where was this man's chance? She had said to Rosy, in speaking\nof the wealth of America, \"Sometimes one is tired of it.\" And Rosy had\nreminded her that there were those who were not tired of it, who\ncould bear some of the burden of it, if it might be laid on their own\nshoulders. The great beautiful, blind-faced house, awaiting its slow\ndoom in the midst of its lonely unfed lands--what could save it, and all\nit represented of race and name, and the stately history of men, but\nthe power one professed to call base and sordid--mere money? She felt a\nsudden impatience at herself for having said she was tired of it. That\nwas a folly which took upon itself the aspect of an affectation.\n\nAnd, if a man could not earn money--or go forth to rob richer neighbours\nof it as in the good old marauding days--or accept it if it were offered\nto him as a gift--what could he do? Nothing. If he had been born a\nvillage labourer, he could have earned by the work of his hands enough\nto keep his cottage roof over him, and have held up his head among his\nfellows. But for such as himself there was no mere labour which would\navail. He had not that rough honest resource. Only the decent living and\norderly management of the generations behind him would have left to him\nfairly his own chance to hold with dignity the place in the world into\nwhich Fate had thrust him at the outset--a blind, newborn thing of whom\nno permission had been asked.\n\n\"If I broke stones upon the highway for twelve hours a day, I might\nearn two shillings,\" he had said to Betty, on the previous day. \"I could\nbreak stones well,\" holding out a big arm, \"but fourteen shillings a\nweek will do no more than buy bread and bacon for a stonebreaker.\"\n\nHe was ordinarily rather silent and stiff in his conversational attitude\ntowards his own affairs. Betty sometimes wondered how she herself knew\nso much about them--how it happened that her thoughts so often dwelt\nupon them. The explanation she had once made to herself had been half\nirony, half serious reflection.\n\n\"It is a result of the first Reuben Vanderpoel. It is because I am of\nthe fighting commercial stock, and, when I see a business problem, I\ncannot leave it alone, even when it is no affair of mine.\"\n\nAs an exposition of the type of the commercial fighting-stock she\npresented, as she paused beneath overshadowing trees, an aspect\nbeautifully suggesting a far different thing.\n\nShe stood--all white from slim shoe to tilted parasol,--and either the\nresult of her inspection of the work done by her order, or a combination\nof her summer-day mood with her feeling for the problem, had given her\na special radiance. It glowed on lip and cheek, and shone in her Irish\neyes.\n\nShe had paused to look at a man approaching down the avenue. He was not\na labourer, and she did not know him. Men who were not labourers usually\nrode or drove, and this one was walking. He was neither young nor old,\nand, though at a distance his aspect was not attracting, she found that\nshe regarded him curiously, and waited for him to draw nearer.\n\nThe man himself was glancing about him with a puzzled look and knitted\nforehead. When he had passed through the village he had seen things he\nhad not expected to see; when he had reached the entrance gate, and--for\nreasons of his own--dismissed his station trap, he had looked at the\nlodge scrutinisingly, because he was not prepared for its picturesque\ntrimness. The avenue was free from weeds and in order, the two gates\nbeyond him were new and substantial. As he went on his way and reached\nthe first, he saw at about a hundred yards distance a tall girl in white\nstanding watching him. Things which were not easily explainable always\nirritated him. That this place--which was his own affair--should present\nan air of mystery, did not improve his humour, which was bad to begin\nwith. He had lately been passing through unpleasant things, which had\nleft him feeling himself tricked and made ridiculous--as only women can\ntrick a man and make him ridiculous, he had said to himself. And there\nhad been an acrid consolation in looking forward to the relief of\nventing one's self on a woman who dare not resent.\n\n\"What has happened, confound it!\" he muttered, when he caught sight\nof the girl. \"Have we set up a house party?\" And then, as he saw more\ndistinctly, \"Damn! What a figure!\"\n\nBy this time Betty herself had begun to see more clearly. Surely this\nwas a face she remembered--though the passing of years and ugly living\nhad thickened and blurred, somewhat, its always heavy features. Suddenly\nshe knew it, and the look in its eyes--the look she had, as a child,\nunreasoningly hated.\n\nNigel Anstruthers had returned from his private holiday.\n\nAs she took a few quiet steps forward to meet him, their eyes rested on\neach other. After a night or two in town his were slightly bloodshot,\nand the light in them was not agreeable.\n\nIt was he who spoke first, and it is possible that he did not quite\nintend to use the expletive which broke from him. But he was remembering\nthings also. Here were eyes he, too, had seen before--twelve years ago\nin the face of an objectionable, long-legged child in New York. And his\nown hatred of them had been founded in his own opinion on the best of\nreasons. And here they gazed at him from the face of a young beauty--for\na beauty she was.\n\n\"Damn it!\" he exclaimed; \"it is Betty.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered, with a faint, but entirely courteous, smile. \"It\nis. I hope you are very well.\"\n\nShe held out her hand. \"A delicious hand,\" was what he said to himself,\nas he took it. And what eyes for a girl to have in her head were those\nwhich looked out at him between shadows. Was there a hint of the devil\nin them? He thought so--he hoped so, since she had descended on the\nplace in this way. But WHAT the devil was the meaning of her being on\nthe spot at all? He was, however, far beyond the lack of astuteness\nwhich might have permitted him to express this last thought at this\nparticular juncture. He was only betrayed into stupid mistakes,\nafterwards to be regretted, when rage caused him utterly to lose control\nof his wits. And, though he was startled and not exactly pleased, he was\nnot in a rage now. The eyelashes and the figure gave an agreeable fillip\nto his humour. Howsoever she had come, she was worth looking at.\n\n\"How could one expect such a delightful thing as this?\" he said, with a\ntouch of ironic amiability. \"It is more than one deserves.\"\n\n\"It is very polite of you to say that,\" answered Betty.\n\nHe was thinking rapidly as he stood and gazed at her. There were, in\ntruth, many things to think of under circumstances so unexpected.\n\n\"May I ask you to excuse my staring at you?\" he inquired with what Rosy\nhad called his \"awful, agreeable smile.\" \"When I saw you last you were a\nfierce nine-year-old American child. I use the word 'fierce' because--if\nyou'll pardon my saying so--there was a certain ferocity about you.\"\n\n\"I have learned at various educational institutions to conceal it,\"\nsmiled Betty.\n\n\n\"May I ask when you arrived?\"\n\n\"A short time after you went abroad.\"\n\n\"Rosalie did not inform me of your arrival.\"\n\n\"She did not know your address. You had forgotten to leave it.\"\n\nHe had made a mistake and realised it. But she presented to him no air\nof having observed his slip. He paused a few seconds, still regarding\nher and still thinking rapidly. He recalled the mended windows and roofs\nand palings in the village, the park gates and entrance. Who the devil\nhad done all that? How could a mere handsome girl be concerned in it?\nAnd yet--here she was.\n\n\"When I drove through the village,\" he said next, \"I saw that some\nremarkable changes had taken place on my property. I feel as if you can\nexplain them to me.\"\n\n\"I hope they are changes which meet with your approval.\"\n\n\"Quite--quite,\" a little curtly. \"Though I confess they mystify me.\nThough I am the son-in-law of an American multimillionaire, I could not\nafford to make such repairs myself.\"\n\nA certain small spitefulness which was his most frequent undoing made it\nimpossible for him to resist adding the innuendo in his last sentence.\nAnd again he saw it was a folly. The impersonal tone of her reply simply\nleft him where he had placed himself.\n\n\"We were sorry not to be able to reach you. As it seemed well to begin\nthe work at once, we consulted Messrs. Townlinson & Sheppard.\"\n\n\"We?\" he repeated. \"Am I to have the pleasure,\" with a slight wryness of\nthe mouth, \"of finding Mr. Vanderpoel also at Stornham?\"\n\n\"No--not yet. As I was on the spot, I saw your solicitors and asked\ntheir advice and approval--for my father. If he had known how necessary\nthe work was, it would have been done before, for Ughtred's sake.\"\n\nHer voice was that of a person who, in stating obvious facts, provides\nno approach to enlightening comment upon them. And there was in her\nmanner the merest gracious impersonality.\n\n\"Do I understand that Mr. Vanderpoel employed someone to visit the place\nand direct the work?\"\n\n\"It was really not difficult to direct. It was merely a matter of\nengaging labour and competent foremen.\"\n\nAn odd expression rose in his eyes.\n\n\"You suggest a novel idea, upon my word,\" he said. \"Is it possible--you\nsee I know something of America--is it possible I must thank YOU for the\nworking of this magic?\"\n\n\"You need not thank me,\" she said, rather slowly, because it was\nnecessary that she also should think of many things at once. \"I could\nnot have helped doing it.\"\n\nShe wished to make all clear to him before he met Rosy. She knew it was\nnot unnatural that the unexpectedness of his appearance might deprive\nLady Anstruthers of presence of mind. Instinct told her that what was\nneeded in intercourse with him was, above all things, presence of mind.\n\n\"I will tell you about it,\" she said. \"We will walk slowly up and down\nhere, if you do not object.\"\n\nHe did not object. He wanted to hear the story as he could not hear it\nfrom his nervous little fool of a wife, who would be frightened into\nforgetting things and their sequence. What he meant to discover was\nwhere he stood in the matter--where his father-in-law stood, and, rather\nspecially, to have a chance to sum up the weaknesses and strengths of\nthe new arrival. That would be to his interest. In talking this thing\nover she would unconsciously reveal how much vanity or emotion or\ninexperience he might count upon as factors safe to use in one's\ndealings with her in the future.\n\nAs he listened he was supported by the fact that he did not lose\nconsciousness of the eyes and the figure. But for these it is probable\nthat he would have gone blind with fury at certain points which forced\nthemselves upon him. The first was that there had been an absurd and\nimmense expenditure which would simply benefit his son and not himself.\nHe could not sell or borrow money on what had been given. Apparently\nthe place had been re-established on a footing such as it had not rested\nupon during his own generation, or his father's. As he loathed life in\nthe country, it was not he who would enjoy its luxury, but his wife\nand her child. The second point was that these people--this girl--had\nsomehow had the sharpness to put themselves in the right, and to place\nhim in a position at which he could not complain without putting himself\nin the wrong. Public opinion would say that benefits had been heaped\nupon him, that the correct thing had been done correctly with the\nknowledge and approval of the legal advisers of his family. It had been\na masterly thing, that visit to Townlinson & Sheppard. He was obliged to\naid his self-control by a glance at the eyelashes. She was a new sort\nof girl, this Betty, whose childhood he had loathed, and, to his jaded\ntaste, novelty appealed enormously. Her attraction for him was also\nadded to by the fact that he was not at all sure that there was not\ncombined with it a pungent spice of the old detestation. He was repelled\nas well as allured. She represented things which he hated. First, the\nmere material power, which no man can bully, whatsoever his humour. It\nwas the power he most longed for and, as he could not hope to possess\nit, most sneered at and raged against. Also, as she talked, it was\nplain that her habit of self-control and her sense of resource would\nbe difficult to deal with. He was a survival of the type of man whose\nsimple creed was that women should not possess resources, as when they\npossessed them they could rarely be made to behave themselves.\n\nBut while he thought these things, he walked by her side and both\nlistened and talked smiling the agreeable smile.\n\n\"You will pardon my dull bewilderment,\" he said. \"It is not unnatural,\nis it--in a mere outsider?\"\n\nAnd Betty, with the beautiful impersonal smile, said:\n\n\"We felt it so unfortunate that even your solicitors did not know your\naddress.\"\n\nWhen, at length, they turned and strolled towards the house, a carriage\nwas drawing up before the door, and at the sight of it, Betty saw her\ncompanion slightly lift his eyebrows. Lady Anstruthers had been out and\nwas returning. The groom got down from the box, and two men-servants\nappeared upon the steps. Lady Anstruthers descended, laughing a little\nas she talked to Ughtred, who had been with her. She was dressed in\nclear, pale grey, and the soft rose lining of her parasol warmed the\ncolour of her skin.\n\nSir Nigel paused a second and put up his glass.\n\n\"Is that my wife?\" he said. \"Really! She quite recalls New York.\"\n\nThe agreeable smile was on his lips as he hastened forward. He always\nmore or less enjoyed coming upon Rosalie suddenly. The obvious result\nwas a pleasing tribute to his power.\n\nBetty, following him, saw what occurred.\n\nUghtred saw him first, and spoke quick and low.\n\n\"Mother!\" he said.\n\nThe tone of his voice was evidently enough. Lady Anstruthers turned with\nan unmistakable start. The rose lining of her parasol ceased to warm her\ncolour. In fact, the parasol itself stepped aside, and she stood with a\nblank, stiff, white face.\n\n\n\"My dear Rosalie,\" said Sir Nigel, going towards her. \"You don't look\nvery glad to see me.\"\n\nHe bent and kissed her quite with the air of a devoted husband. Knowing\nwhat the caress meant, and seeing Rosy's face as she submitted to\nit, Betty felt rather cold. After the conjugal greeting he turned to\nUghtred.\n\n\"You look remarkably well,\" he said.\n\nBetty came forward.\n\n\"We met in the park, Rosy,\" she explained. \"We have been talking to each\nother for half an hour.\"\n\nThe atmosphere which had surrounded her during the last three months\nhad done much for Lady Anstruthers' nerves. She had the power to recover\nherself. Sir Nigel himself saw this when she spoke.\n\n\"I was startled because I was not expecting to see you,\" she said. \"I\nthought you were still on the Riviera. I hope you had a pleasant journey\nhome.\"\n\n\"I had an extraordinarily pleasant surprise in finding your sister\nhere,\" he answered. And they went into the house.\n\nIn descending the staircase on his way to the drawing-room before\ndinner, Sir Nigel glanced about him with interested curiosity. If\nthe village had been put in order, something more had been done here.\nRemembering the worn rugs and the bald-headed tiger, he lifted his\nbrows. To leave one's house in a state of resigned dilapidation and\nreturn to find it filled with all such things as comfort combined with\nexcellent taste might demand, was an enlivening experience--or would\nhave been so under some circumstances. As matters stood, perhaps, he\nmight have felt better pleased if things had been less well done. But\nthey were very well done. They had managed to put themselves in the\nright in this also. The rich sobriety of colour and form left no opening\nfor supercilious comment--which was a neat weapon it was annoying to be\nrobbed of.\n\nThe drawing-room was fresh, brightly charming, and full of flowers.\nBetty was standing before an open window with her sister. His wife's\nshoulders, he observed at once, had absolutely begun to suggest\ncontours. At all events, her bones no longer stuck out. But one did\nnot look at one's wife's shoulders when one could turn from them to a\nfairness of velvet and ivory. \"You know,\" he said, approaching them, \"I\nfind all this very amazing. I have been looking out of my window on to\nthe gardens.\"\n\n\"It is Betty who has done it all,\" said Rosy.\n\n\"I did not suspect you of doing it, my dear Rosalie,\" smiling. \"When I\nsaw Betty standing in the avenue, I knew at once that it was she who had\nmended the chimney-pots in the village and rehung the gates.\"\n\nFor the present, at least, it was evident that he meant to be\nsufficiently amiable. At the dinner table he was conversational and\nasked many questions, professing a natural interest in what had been\ndone. It was not difficult to talk to a girl whose eyes and shoulders\ncombined themselves with a quick wit and a power to attract which he\nreluctantly owned he had never seen equalled. His reluctance arose\nfrom the fact that such a power complicated matters. He must be on\nthe defensive until he knew what she was going to do, what he must do\nhimself, and what results were probable or possible. He had spent his\nlife in intrigue of one order or another. He enjoyed outwitting people\nand rather preferred to attain an end by devious paths. He began every\nacquaintance on the defensive. His argument was that you never knew how\nthings would turn out, consequently, it was as well to conduct one's\nself at the outset with the discreet forethought of a man in the\npresence of an enemy. He did not know how things would turn out in\nBetty's case, and it was a little confusing to find one's self watching\nher with a sense of excitement. He would have preferred to be cool--to\nbe cold--and he realised that he could not keep his eyes off her.\n\n\"I remember, with regret,\" he said to her later in the evening, \"that\nwhen you were a child we were enemies.\"\n\n\"I am afraid we were,\" was Betty's impartial answer.\n\n\"I am sure it was my fault,\" he said. \"Pray forget it. Since you have\naccomplished such wonders, will you not, in the morning, take me about\nthe place and explain to me how it has been done?\"\n\nWhen Betty went to her room she dismissed her maid as soon as possible,\nand sat for some time alone and waiting. She had had no opportunity to\nspeak to Rosy in private, and she was sure she would come to her. In the\ncourse of half an hour she heard a knock at the door.\n\nYes, it was Rosy, and her newly-born colour had fled and left her\nlooking dragged again. She came forward and dropped into a low chair\nnear Betty, letting her face fall into her hands.\n\n\"I'm very sorry, Betty,\" she half whispered, \"but it is no use.\"\n\n\"What is no use?\" Betty asked.\n\n\"Nothing is any use. All these years have made me such a coward. I\nsuppose I always was a coward, but in the old days there never was\nanything to be afraid of.\"\n\n\"What are you most afraid of now?\"\n\n\"I don't know. That is the worst. I am afraid of HIM--just of\nhimself--of the look in his eyes--of what he may be planning quietly. My\nstrength dies away when he comes near me.\"\n\n\"What has he said to you?\" she asked.\n\n\"He came into my dressing-room and sat and talked. He looked about from\none thing to another and pretended to admire it all and congratulated\nme. But though he did not sneer at what he saw, his eyes were sneering\nat me. He talked about you. He said that you were a very clever woman. I\ndon't know how he manages to imply that a very clever woman is something\ncunning and debased--but it means that when he says it. It seems to\ninsinuate things which make one grow hot all over.\"\n\nShe put out a hand and caught one of Betty's.\n\n\"Betty, Betty,\" she implored. \"Don't make him angry. Don't.\"\n\n\"I am not going to begin by making him angry,\" Betty said. \"And I do not\nthink he will try to make me angry--at first.\"\n\n\"No, he will not,\" cried Rosalie. \"And--and you remember what I told you\nwhen first we talked about him?\"\n\n\"And do you remember,\" was Betty's answer, \"what I said to you when I\nfirst met you in the park? If we were to cable to New York this moment,\nwe could receive an answer in a few hours.\"\n\n\"He would not let us do it,\" said Rosy. \"He would stop us in some\nway--as he stopped my letters to mother--as he stopped me when I tried\nto run away. Oh, Betty, I know him and you do not.\"\n\n\"I shall know him better every day. That is what I must do. I must learn\nto know him. He said something more to you than you have told me, Rosy.\nWhat was it?\"\n\n\"He waited until Detcham left me,\" Lady Anstruthers confessed, more than\nhalf reluctantly. \"And then he got up to go away, and stood with his\nhands resting on the chairback, and spoke to me in a low, queer voice.\nHe said, 'Don't try to play any tricks on me, my good girl--and don't\nlet your sister try to play any. You would both have reason to regret\nit.'\"\n\nShe was a half-hypnotised thing, and Betty, watching her with curious\nbut tender eyes, recognised the abnormality.\n\n\"Ah, if I am a clever woman,\" she said, \"he is a clever man. He is\nbeginning to see that his power is slipping away. That was what G.\nSelden would call 'bluff.'\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\nNO, SHE WOULD NOT\n\nSir Nigel did not invite Rosalie to accompany them, when the next\nmorning, after breakfast, he reminded Betty of his suggestion of the\nnight before, that she should walk over the place with him, and show him\nwhat had been done. He preferred to make his study of his sister-in-law\nundisturbed.\n\nThere was no detail whose significance he missed as they went about\ntogether. He had keen eyes and was a quite sufficiently practical person\non such matters as concerned his own interests. In this case it was to\nhis interest to make up his mind as to what he might gain or lose by the\nappearance of his wife's family. He did not mean to lose--if it could be\nhelped--anything either of personal importance or material benefit. And\nit could only be helped by his comprehending clearly what he had to deal\nwith. Betty was, at present, the chief factor in the situation, and he\nwas sufficiently astute to see that she might not be easy to read.\nHis personal theories concerning women presented to him two or three\neffective ways of managing them. You made love to them, you flattered\nthem either subtly or grossly, you roughly or smoothly bullied them,\nor you harrowed them with haughty indifference--if your love-making had\nproduced its proper effect--when it was necessary to lure or drive or\ntrick them into submission. Women should be made useful in one way or\nanother. Little fool as she was, Rosalie had been useful. He had, after\nall was said and done, had some comparatively easy years as the result\nof her existence. But she had not been useful enough, and there had even\nbeen moments when he had wondered if he had made a mistake in separating\nher entirely from her family. There might have been more to be gained\nif he had allowed them to visit her and had played the part of a devoted\nhusband in their presence. A great bore, of course, but they could not\nhave spent their entire lives at Stornham. Twelve years ago, however, he\nhad known very little of Americans, and he had lost his temper. He was\nreally very fond of his temper, and rather enjoyed referring to it with\ntolerant regret as being a bad one and beyond his control--with a manner\nwhich suggested that the attribute was the inevitable result of strength\nof character and masculine spirit. The luxury of giving way to it was a\ngreat one, and it was exasperating as he walked about with this handsome\ngirl to find himself beginning to suspect that, where she was concerned,\nsome self-control might be necessary. He was led to this thought because\nthe things he took in on all sides could only have been achieved by a\nperson whose mind was a steadily-balanced thing. In one's treatment of\nsuch a creature, methods must be well chosen. The crudest had sufficed\nto overwhelm Rosalie. He tried two or three little things as experiments\nduring their walk.\n\nThe first was to touch with dignified pathos on the subject of Ughtred.\nBetty, he intimated gently, could imagine what a man's grief and\ndisappointment might be on finding his son and heir deformed in such a\nmanner. The delicate reserve with which he managed to convey his fear\nthat Rosalie's own uncontrolled hysteric attacks had been the cause of\nthe misfortune was very well done. She had, of course, been very young\nand much spoiled, and had not learned self-restraint, poor girl.\n\nIt was at this point that Betty first realised a certain hideous thing.\nShe must actually remain silent--there would be at the outset many times\nwhen she could only protect her sister by refraining from either denial\nor argument. If she turned upon him now with refutation, it was Rosy who\nwould be called upon to bear the consequences. He would go at once to\nRosy, and she herself would have done what she had said she would not\ndo--she would have brought trouble upon the poor girl before she was\nstrong enough to bear it. She suspected also that his intention was\nto discover how much she had heard, and if she might be goaded into\nbetraying her attitude in the matter.\n\nBut she was not to be so goaded. He watched her closely and her very\ncolour itself seemed to be under her own control. He had expected--if\nshe had heard hysteric, garbled stories from his wife--to see a flame\nof scarlet leap up on the cheek he was admiring. There was no such leap,\nwhich was baffling in itself. Could it be that experience had taught\nRosalie the discretion of keeping her mouth shut?\n\n\"I am very fond of Ughtred,\" was the sole comment he was granted.\n\"We made friends from the first. As he grows older and stronger, his\nmisfortune may be less apparent. He will be a very clever man.\"\n\n\"He will be a very clever man if he is at all like----\" He checked\nhimself with a slight movement of his shoulders. \"I was going to say a\nthing utterly banal. I beg your pardon. I forgot for the moment that I\nwas not talking to an English girl.\"\n\nIt was so stupid that she turned and looked at him, smiling faintly. But\nher answer was quite mild and soft.\n\n\"Do not deprive me of compliments because I am a mere American,\" she\nsaid. \"I am very fond of them, and respond at once.\"\n\n\"You are very daring,\" he said, looking straight into her\neyes--\"deliciously so. American women always are, I think.\"\n\n\"The young devil,\" he was saying internally. \"The beautiful young devil!\nShe throws one off the track.\"\n\nHe found himself more and more attracted and exasperated as they made\ntheir rounds. It was his sense of being attracted which was the cause\nof his exasperation. A girl who could stir one like this would be a\ndangerous enemy. Even as a friend she would not be safe, because one\nfaced the absurd peril of losing one's head a little and forgetting\nthe precautions one should never lose sight of where a woman was\nconcerned--the precautions which provided for one's holding a good taut\nrein in one's own hands.\n\nThey went from gardens to greenhouses, from greenhouses to stables, and\nhe was on the watch for the moment when she would reveal some little\nfeminine pose or vanity, but, this morning, at least, she laid none\nbare. She did not strike him as a being of angelic perfections, but\nshe was very modern and not likely to show easily any openings in her\narmour.\n\n\"Of course, I continue to be amazed,\" he commented, \"though one ought\nnot to be amazed at anything which evolves from your extraordinary\ncountry. In spite of your impersonal air, I shall persist in regarding\nyou as my benefactor. But, to be frank, I always told Rosalie that if\nshe would write to your father he would certainly put things in order.\"\n\n\"She did write once, you will remember,\" answered Betty.\n\n\"Did she?\" with courteous vagueness. \"Really, I am afraid I did not hear\nof it. My poor wife has her own little ideas about the disposal of her\nincome.\"\n\nAnd Betty knew that she was expected to believe that Rosy had hoarded\nthe money sent to restore the place, and from sheer weak miserliness had\nallowed her son's heritage to fall to ruin. And but for Rosy's sake,\nshe might have stopped upon the path and, looking at him squarely, have\nsaid, \"You are lying to me. And I know the truth.\"\n\nHe continued to converse amiably.\n\n\"Of course, it is you one must thank, not only for rousing in the poor\ngirl some interest in her personal appearance, but also some interest in\nher neighbours. Some women, after they marry and pass girlhood, seem to\nrelease their hold on all desire to attract or retain friends. For years\nRosalie has given herself up to a chronic semi-invalidism. When the\nmistress of a house is always depressed and languid and does not return\nvisits, neighbours become discouraged and drop off, as it were.\"\n\nIf his wife had told stories to gain her sympathy his companion would be\nsure to lose her temper and show her hand. If he could make her openly\nlose her temper, he would have made an advance.\n\n\"One can quite understand that,\" she said. \"It is a great happiness to\nme to see Rosy gaining ground every day. She has taken me out with her\na good many times, and people are beginning to realise that she likes to\nsee them at Stornham.\"\n\n\"You are very delightful,\" he said, \"with your 'She has taken me out.'\nWhen I glanced at the magnificent array of cards on the salver in the\nhall, I realised a number of things, and quite vulgarly lost my breath.\nThe Dunholms have been very amiable in recalling our existence. But\ncharming Americans--of your order--arouse amiable emotions.\"\n\n\"I am very amiable myself,\" said Betty.\n\nIt was he who flushed now. He was losing patience at feeling himself\nheld with such lightness at arm's length, and at being, in spite of\nhimself, somehow compelled to continue to assume a jocular courtesy.\n\n\"No, you are not,\" he answered.\n\n\"Not?\" repeated Betty, with an incredulous lifting of her brows.\n\n\"You are charming and clever, but I rather suspect you of being a vixen.\nAt all events you are a spirited young woman and quick-witted enough to\nunderstand the attraction you must have for the sordid herd.\"\n\nAnd then he became aware--if not of an opening in her armour--at least\nof a joint in it. For he saw, near her ear, a deepening warmth. That was\nit. She was quick-witted, and she hid somewhere a hot pride.\n\n\"I confess, however,\" he proceeded cheerfully, \"that notwithstanding my\nown experience of the habits of the sordid herd, I saw one card I was\nsurprised to find, though really\"--shrugging his shoulders--\"I ought to\nhave been less surprised to find it than to find any other. But it was\nbold. I suppose the fellow is desperate.\"\n\n\"You are speaking of----?\" suggested Betty.\n\n\"Of Mount Dunstan. Hang it all, it WAS bold!\" As if in half-amused\ndisgust.\n\nAs she had walked through the garden paths, Betty had at intervals bent\nand gathered a flower, until she held in one hand a loose, fair sheaf.\nAt this moment she stooped to break off a spire of pale blue campanula.\nAnd she was--as with a shock--struck with a consciousness that she\nbent because she must--because to do so was a refuge--a concealment\nof something she must hide. It had come upon her without a second's\nwarning. Sir Nigel was right. She was a vixen--a virago. She was in such\na rage that her heart sprang up and down and her cheek and eyes were on\nfire. Her long-trained control of herself was gone. And her shock was a\nlightning-swift awakening to the fact that she felt all this--she\nmust hide her face--because it was this one man--just this one and no\nother--who was being dragged into this thing with insult.\n\nIt was an awakening, and she broke off, rather slowly,\none--two--three--even four campanula stems before she stood upright\nagain.\n\nAs for Nigel Anstruthers--he went on talking in his low-pitched,\ndisgusted voice.\n\n\"Surely he might count himself out of the running. There will be a good\ndeal of running, my dear Betty. You fair Americans have learned that by\nthis time. But that a man who has not even a decent name to offer--who\nis blackballed by his county--should coolly present himself as a\npretendant is an insolence he should be kicked for.\"\n\nBetty arranged her campanulas carefully. There was no exterior reason\nwhy she should draw sword in Lord Mount Dunstan's defence. He had\ncertainly not seemed to expect anything intimately interested from\nher. His manner she had generally felt to be rather restrained. But one\ncould, in a measure, express one's self.\n\n\"Whatsoever the 'running,'\" she remarked, \"no pretendant has\ncomplimented me by presenting himself, so far--and Lord Mount Dunstan is\nphysically an unusually strong man.\"\n\n\"You mean it would be difficult to kick him? Is this partisanship? I\nhope not. Am I to understand,\" he added with deliberation, \"that Rosalie\nhas received him here?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And that you have received him, also--as you have received Lord\nWestholt?\"\n\n\"Quite.\"\n\n\"Then I must discuss the matter with Rosalie. It is not to be discussed\nwith you.\"\n\n\"You mean that you will exercise your authority in the matter?\"\n\n\"In England, my dear girl, the master of a house is still sometimes\nguilty of exercising authority in matters which concern the reputation\nof his female relatives. In the absence of your father, I shall not\nallow you, while you are under my roof, to endanger your name in any\ndegree. I am, at least, your brother by marriage. I intend to protect\nyou.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Betty.\n\n\"You are young and extremely handsome, you will have an enormous\nfortune, and you have evidently had your own way all your life. A girl,\nsuch as you are, may either make a magnificent marriage or a ridiculous\nand humiliating one. Neither American young women, nor English young\nmen, are as disinterested as they were some years ago. Each has begun to\nlearn what the other has to give.\"\n\n\"I think that is true,\" commented Betty.\n\n\"In some cases there is a good deal to be exchanged on both sides. You\nhave a great deal to give, and should get exchange worth accepting. A\nbeggared estate and a tainted title are not good enough.\"\n\n\"That is businesslike,\" Betty made comment again.\n\nSir Nigel laughed quietly.\n\n\"The fact is--I hope you won't misunderstand my saying it--you do not\nstrike me as being UN-businesslike, yourself.\"\n\n\"I am not,\" answered Betty.\n\n\"I thought not,\" rather narrowing his eyes as he watched her, because he\nbelieved that she must involuntarily show her hand if he irritated her\nsufficiently. \"You do not impress me as being one of the girls who make\nunsuccessful marriages. You are a modern New York beauty--not an early\nVictorian sentimentalist.\" He did not despair of results from his\nprocess of irritation. To gently but steadily convey to a beautiful and\nspirited young creature that no man could approach her without ulterior\nmotive was rather a good idea. If one could make it clear--with a casual\nair of sensibly taking it for granted--that the natural power of youth,\nwit, and beauty were rendered impotent by a greatness of fortune whose\nproportions obliterated all else; if one simply argued from the premise\nthat young love was no affair of hers, since she must always be regarded\nas a gilded chattel, whose cost was writ large in plain figures, what\ngirl, with blood in her veins, could endure it long without wincing?\nThis girl had undue, and, as he regarded such matters, unseemly control\nover her temper and her nerves, but she had blood enough in her veins,\nand presently she would say or do something which would give him a lead.\n\n\"When you marry----\" he began.\n\nShe lifted her head delicately, but ended the sentence for him with eyes\nwhich were actually not unsmiling.\n\n\"When I marry, I shall ask something in exchange for what I have to\ngive.\"\n\n\"If the exchange is to be equal, you must ask a great deal,\" he\nanswered. \"That is why you must be protected from such fellows as Mount\nDunstan.\"\n\n\"If it becomes necessary, perhaps I shall be able to protect myself,\"\nshe said.\n\n\"Ah!\" regretfully, \"I am afraid I have annoyed you--and that you need\nprotection more than you suspect.\" If she were flesh and blood, she\ncould scarcely resist resenting the implication contained in this. But\nresist it she did, and with a cool little smile which stirred him to\nsudden, if irritated, admiration.\n\nShe paused a second, and used the touch of gentle regret herself.\n\n\"You have wounded my vanity by intimating that my admirers do not love\nme for myself alone.\"\n\nHe paused, also, and, narrowing his eyes again, looked straight between\nher lashes.\n\n\"They ought to love you for yourself alone,\" he said, in a low voice.\n\"You are a deucedly attractive girl.\"\n\n\"Oh, Betty,\" Rosy had pleaded, \"don't make him angry--don't make him\nangry.\"\n\nSo Betty lifted her shoulders slightly without comment.\n\n\"Shall we go back to the house now?\" she said. \"Rosalie will naturally\nbe anxious to hear that what has been done in your absence has met with\nyour approval.\"\n\nIn what manner his approval was expressed to Rosalie, Betty did not hear\nthis morning, at least. Externally cool though she had appeared, the\nprocess had not been without its results, and she felt that she would\nprefer to be alone.\n\n\"I must write some letters to catch the next steamer,\" she said, as she\nwent upstairs.\n\nWhen she entered her room, she went to her writing table and sat down,\nwith pen and paper before her. She drew the paper towards her and took\nup the pen, but the next moment she laid it down and gave a slight push\nto the paper. As she did so she realised that her hand trembled.\n\n\"I must not let myself form the habit of falling into rages--or I\nshall not be able to keep still some day, when I ought to do it,\" she\nwhispered. \"I am in a fury--a fury.\" And for a moment she covered her\nface.\n\nShe was a strong girl, but a girl, notwithstanding her powers. What she\nsuddenly saw was that, as if by one movement of some powerful unseen\nhand, Rosy, who had been the centre of all things, had been swept out of\nher thought. Her anger at the injustice done to Rosy had been as nothing\nbefore the fire which had flamed in her at the insult flung at the\nother. And all that was undue and unbalanced. One might as well look the\nthing straightly in the face. Her old child hatred of Nigel Anstruthers\nhad sprung up again in ten-fold strength. There was, it was true,\nsomething abominable about him, something which made his words more\nabominable than they would have been if another man had uttered\nthem--but, though it was inevitable that his method should rouse one,\nwhere those of one's own blood were concerned, it was not enough to fill\none with raging flame when his malignity was dealing with those who were\nalmost strangers. Mount Dunstan was almost a stranger--she had met Lord\nWestholt oftener. Would she have felt the same hot beat of the blood, if\nLord Westholt had been concerned? No, she answered herself frankly, she\nwould not.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\nA GREAT BALL\n\nA certain great ball, given yearly at Dunholm Castle, was one of the\nmost notable social features of the county. It took place when the house\nwas full of its most interestingly distinguished guests, and, though\nother balls might be given at other times, this one was marked by a\ndegree of greater state. On several occasions the chief guests had\nbeen great personages indeed, and to be bidden to meet them implied\na selection flattering in itself. One's invitation must convey by\ninference that one was either brilliant, beautiful, or admirable, if not\nimportant.\n\nNigel Anstruthers had never appeared at what the uninvited were wont,\nwith derisive smiles, to call The Great Panjandrum Function--which was\nan ironic designation not employed by such persons as received cards\nbidding them to the festivity. Stornham Court was not popular in\nthe county; no one had yearned for the society of the Dowager Lady\nAnstruthers, even in her youth; and a not too well-favoured young man\nwith an ill-favoured temper, noticeably on the lookout for grievances,\nis not an addition to one's circle. At nineteen Nigel had discovered\nthe older Lord Mount Dunstan and his son Tenham to be congenial\nacquaintances, and had been so often absent from home that his\nneighbours would have found social intercourse with him difficult, even\nif desirable. Accordingly, when the county paper recorded the splendours\nof The Great Panjandrum Function--which it by no means mentioned by that\nname--the list of \"Among those present\" had not so far contained the\nname of Sir Nigel Anstruthers.\n\nSo, on a morning a few days after his return, the master of Stornham\nturned over a card of invitation and read it several times before\nspeaking.\n\n\"I suppose you know what this means,\" he said at last to Rosalie, who\nwas alone with him.\n\n\"It means that we are invited to Dunholm Castle for the ball, doesn't\nit?\"\n\nHer husband tossed the card aside on the table.\n\n\"It means that Betty will be invited to every house where there is a son\nwho must be disposed of profitably.\n\n\"She is invited because she is beautiful and clever. She would be\ninvited if she had no money at all,\" said Rosy daringly. She was\nactually growing daring, she thought sometimes. It would not have been\npossible to say anything like this a few months ago.\n\n\"Don't make silly mistakes,\" said Nigel. \"There are a good many handsome\ngirls who receive comparatively little attention. But the hounds of war\nare let loose, when one of your swollen American fortunes appears. The\nobviousness of it 'virtuously' makes me sick. It's as vulgar--as New\nYork.\"\n\nWhat befel next brought to Sir Nigel a shock of curious enlightenment,\nbut no one was more amazed than Rosy herself. She felt, when she heard\nher own voice, as if she must be rather mad.\n\n\"I would rather,\" she said quite distinctly, \"that you did not speak to\nme of New York in that way.\"\n\n\"What!\" said Anstruthers, staring at her with contempt which was\nderision.\n\n\"It is my home,\" she answered. \"It is not proper that I should hear it\nspoken of slightingly.\"\n\n\"Your home! It has not taken the slightest notice of you for twelve\nyears. Your people dropped you as if you were a hot potato.\"\n\n\"They have taken me up again.\" Still in amazement at her own boldness,\nbut somehow learning something as she went on.\n\nHe walked over to her side, and stood before her.\n\n\"Look here, Rosalie,\" he said. \"You have been taking lessons from your\nsister. She is a beauty and young and you are not. People will stand\nthings from her they will not take from you. I would stand some things\nmyself, because it rather amuses a man to see a fine girl peacocking.\nIt's merely ridiculous in you, and I won't stand it--not a bit of it.\"\n\nIt was not specially fortunate for him that the door opened as he was\nspeaking, and Betty came in with her own invitation in her hand. He\nwas quick enough, however, to turn to greet her with a shrug of his\nshoulders.\n\n\"I am being favoured with a little scene by my wife,\" he explained. \"She\nis capable of getting up excellent little scenes, but I daresay she does\nnot show you that side of her temper.\"\n\nBetty took a comfortable chintz-covered, easy chair. Her expression was\nevasively speculative.\n\n\"Was it a scene I interrupted?\" she said. \"Then I must not go away\nand leave you to finish it. You were saying that you would not 'stand'\nsomething. What does a man do when he will not 'stand' a thing? It\nalways sounds so final and appalling--as if he were threatening horrible\nthings such as, perhaps, were a resource in feudal times. What IS the\nresource in these dull days of law and order--and policemen?\"\n\n\"Is this American chaff?\" he was disagreeably conscious that he was not\nwholly successful in his effort to be lofty.\n\nThe frankness of Betty's smile was quite without prejudice.\n\n\"Dear me, no,\" she said. \"It is only the unpicturesque result of\nan unfeminine knowledge of the law. And I was thinking how one is\nlimited--and yet how things are simplified after all.\"\n\n\"Simplified!\" disgustedly.\n\n\"Yes, really. You see, if Rosy were violent she could not beat you--even\nif she were strong enough--because you could ring the bell and give her\ninto custody. And you could not beat her because the same unpleasant\nthing would happen to you. Policemen do rob things of colour, don't\nthey? And besides, when one remembers that mere vulgar law insists\nthat no one can be forced to live with another person who is brutal or\nloathsome, that's simple, isn't it? You could go away from Rosy,\" with\nsweet clearness, \"at any moment you wished--as far away as you liked.\"\n\n\"You seem to forget,\" still feeling that convincing loftiness was not\neasy, \"that when a man leaves his wife, or she deserts him, it is she\nwho is likely to be called upon to bear the onus of public opinion.\"\n\n\"Would she be called upon to bear it under all circumstances?\"\n\n\"Damned clever woman as you are, you know that she would, as well as I\nknow it.\" He made an abrupt gesture with his hand. \"You know that what\nI say is true. Women who take to their heels are deucedly unpopular in\nEngland.\"\n\n\"I have not been long in England, but I have been struck by the\nprevalence of a sort of constitutional British sense of fair play\namong the people who really count. The Dunholms, for instance, have\nit markedly. In America it is the men who force women to take to their\nheels who are deucedly unpopular. The Americans' sense of fair play is\ntheir most English quality. It was brought over in ships by the first\ncolonists--like the pieces of fine solid old furniture, one even now\nsees, here and there, in houses in Virginia.\"\n\n\"But the fact remains,\" said Nigel, with an unpleasant laugh, \"the fact\nremains, my dear girl.\"\n\n\"The fact that does remain,\" said Betty, not unpleasantly at all, and\nstill with her gentle air of mere unprejudiced speculation, \"is that, if\na man or woman is properly ill-treated--PROPERLY--not in any amateurish\nway--they reach the point of not caring in the least--nothing matters,\nbut that they must get away from the horror of the unbearable thing\n--never to see or hear of it again is heaven enough to make anything\nelse a thing to smile at. But one could settle the other point by\nexperimenting. Suppose you run away from Rosy, and then we can see if\nshe is cut by the county.\"\n\nHis laugh was unpleasant again.\n\n\"So long as you are with her, she will not be cut. There are a number\nof penniless young men of family in this, as well as the adjoining,\ncounties. Do you think Mount Dunstan would cut her?\"\n\nShe looked down at the carpet thoughtfully a moment, and then lifted her\neyes.\n\n\"I do not think so,\" she answered. \"But I will ask him.\"\n\nHe was startled by a sudden feeling that she might be capable of it.\n\n\"Oh, come now,\" he said, \"that goes beyond a joke. You will not do\nany such absurd thing. One does not want one's domestic difficulties\ndiscussed by one's neighbours.\"\n\nBetty opened coolly surprised eyes.\n\n\"I did not understand it was a personal matter,\" she remarked. \"Where do\nthe domestic difficulties come in?\"\n\nHe stared at her a few seconds with the look she did not like, which\nwas less likeable at the moment, because it combined itself with other\nthings.\n\n\"Hang it,\" he muttered. \"I wish I could keep my temper as you can keep\nyours,\" and he turned on his heel and left the room.\n\nRosy had not spoken. She had sat with her hands in her lap, looking out\nof the window. She had at first had a moment of terror. She had,\nindeed, once uttered in her soul the abject cry: \"Don't make him angry,\nBetty--oh, don't, don't!\" And suddenly it had been stilled, and she\nhad listened. This was because she realised that Nigel himself was\nlistening. That made her see what she had not dared to allow herself\nto see before. These trite things were true. There were laws to protect\none. If Betty had not been dealing with mere truths, Nigel would have\nstopped her. He had been supercilious, but he could not contradict her.\n\n\"Betty,\" she said, when her sister came to her, \"you said that to show\nME things, as well as to show them to him. I knew you did, and listened\nto every word. It was good for me to hear you.\"\n\n\"Clear-cut, unadorned facts are like bullets,\" said Betty. \"They reach\nhome, if one's aim is good. The shiftiest people cannot evade them.\"\n\n. . . . .\n\nA certain thing became evident to Betty during the time which elapsed\nbetween the arrival of the invitations and the great ball. Despite an\nobvious intention to assume an amiable pose for the time being, Sir\nNigel could not conceal a not quite unexplainable antipathy to one\nindividual. This individual was Mount Dunstan, whom it did not seem easy\nfor him to leave alone. He seemed to recur to him as a subject, without\nany special reason, and this somewhat puzzled Betty until she heard from\nRosalie of his intimacy with Lord Tenham, which, in a measure, explained\nit. The whole truth was that \"The Lout,\" as he had been called, had\nindulged in frank speech in his rare intercourse with his brother and\nhis friends, and had once interfered with hot young fury in a matter in\nwhich the pair had specially wished to avoid all interference. His open\nscorn of their methods of entertaining themselves they had felt to be\ndisgusting impudence, which would have been deservedly punished with a\nhorsewhip, if the youngster had not been a big-muscled, clumsy oaf, with\na dangerous eye. Upon this footing their acquaintance had stood in past\nyears, and to decide--as Sir Nigel had decided--that the oaf in question\nhad begun to make his bid for splendid fortune under the roof of\nStornham Court itself was a thing not to be regarded calmly. It was\nmore than he could stand, and the folly of temper, which was forever his\nundoing, betrayed him into mistakes more than once. This girl, with\nher beauty and her wealth, he chose to regard as a sort of property\nrightfully his own. She was his sister-in-law, at least; she was living\nunder his roof; he had more or less the power to encourage or discourage\nsuch aspirants as appeared. Upon the whole there was something soothing\nto one's vanity in appearing before the world as the person at present\nresponsible for her. It gave a man a certain dignity of position, and\nhis chief girding at fate had always risen from the fact that he had not\nhad dignity of position. He would not be held cheap in this matter, at\nleast. But sometimes, as he looked at the girl he turned hot and sick,\nas it was driven home to him that he was no longer young, that he had\nnever been good-looking, and that he had cut the ground from under his\nfeet twelve years ago, when he had married Rosalie! If he could have\nwaited--if he could have done several other things--perhaps the clever\nacting of a part, and his power of domination might have given him a\nchance. Even that blackguard of a Mount Dunstan had a better one now.\nHe was young, at least, and free--and a big strong beast. He was\nforced, with bitter reluctance, to admit that he himself was not even\nparticularly strong--of late he had felt it hideously.\n\nSo he detested Mount Dunstan the more for increasing reasons,\nas he thought the matter over. It would seem, perhaps, but a\nsubtle pleasure to the normal mind, but to him there was\npleasure--support--aggrandisement--in referring to the ill case of the\nMount Dunstan estate, in relating illustrative anecdotes, in dwelling\nupon the hopelessness of the outlook, and the notable unpopularity of\nthe man himself. A confiding young lady from the States was required,\nhe said on one occasion, but it would be necessary that she should be a\nyoung person of much simplicity, who would not be alarmed or chilled by\nthe obvious. No one would realise this more clearly than Mount Dunstan\nhimself. He said it coldly and casually, as if it were the simplest\nmatter of fact. If the fellow had been making himself agreeable\nto Betty, it was as well that certain points should be--as it were\ninadvertently--brought before her.\n\nMiss Vanderpoel was really rather fine, people said to each other\nafterwards, when she entered the ballroom at Dunholm Castle with her\nbrother-in-law. She bore herself as composedly as if she had been\nescorted by the most admirable and dignified of conservative relatives,\ninstead of by a man who was more definitely disliked and disapproved of\nthan any other man in the county whom decent people were likely to meet.\nYet, she was far too clever a girl not to realise the situation clearly,\nthey said to each other. She had arrived in England to find her sister a\nneglected wreck, her fortune squandered, and her existence stripped bare\nof even such things as one felt to be the mere decencies. There was but\none thing to be deduced from the facts which had stared her in the\nface. But of her deductions she had said nothing whatever, which was, of\ncourse, remarkable in a young person. It may be mentioned that, perhaps,\nthere had been those who would not have been reluctant to hear what she\nmust have had to say, and who had even possibly given her a delicate\nlead. But the lead had never been taken. One lady had even remarked\nthat, on her part, she felt that a too great reserve verged upon\nsecretiveness, which was not a desirable girlish quality.\n\nOf course the situation had been so much discussed that people were\nnaturally on the lookout for the arrival of the Stornham party, as\nit was known that Sir Nigel had returned home, and would be likely to\npresent himself with his wife and sister-in-law. There was not a dowager\npresent who did not know how and where he had reprehensibly spent the\nlast months. It served him quite right that the Spanish dancing person\nhad coolly left him in the lurch for a younger and more attractive, as\nwell as a richer man. If it were not for Miss Vanderpoel, one need not\npretend that one knew nothing about the affair--in fact, if it had not\nbeen for Miss Vanderpoel, he would not have received an invitation--and\npoor Lady Anstruthers would be sitting at home, still the forlorn little\nfrump and invalid she had so wonderfully ceased to be since her sister\nhad taken her in hand. She was absolutely growing even pretty and young,\nand her clothes were really beautiful. The whole thing was amazing.\n\nBetty, as well as Rosalie and Nigel--knew that many people turned\nundisguisedly to look at them--even to watch them as they came into the\nsplendid ballroom. It was a splendid ballroom and a stately one, and\nLord Dunholm and Lord Westholt shared a certain thought when they met\nher, which was that hers was distinctly the proud young brilliance of\npresence which figured most perfectly against its background. Much as\npeople wanted to look at Sir Nigel, their eyes were drawn from him\nto Miss Vanderpoel. After all it was she who made him an object of\ninterest. One wanted to know what she would do with him--how she would\n\"carry him off.\" How much did she know of the distaste people felt for\nhim, since she would not talk or encourage talk? The Dunholms could not\nhave invited her and her sister, and have ignored him; but did she not\nguess that they would have ignored him, if they could? and was there not\nnatural embarrassment in feeling forced to appear in pomp, as it were,\nunder his escort?\n\n\nBut no embarrassment was perceptible. Her manner committed her to no\nrecognition of a shadow of a flaw in the character of her companion. It\neven carried a certain conviction with it, and the lookers-on felt the\nimpossibility of suggesting any such flaw by their own manner. For this\nevening, at least, the man must actually be treated as if he were an\nentirely unobjectionable person. It appeared as if that was what the\ngirl wanted, and intended should happen.\n\nThis was what Nigel himself had begun to perceive, but he did not put it\npleasantly. Deucedly clever girl as she was, he said to himself, she\nsaw that it would be more agreeable to have no nonsense talked, and no\nruffling of tempers. He had always been able to convey to people that\nthe ruffling of his temper was a thing to be avoided, and perhaps she\nhad already been sharp enough to realise this was a fact to be counted\nwith. She was sharp enough, he said to himself, to see anything.\n\nThe function was a superb one. The house was superb, the rooms of\nentertainment were in every proportion perfect, and were quite renowned\nfor the beauty of the space they offered; the people themselves were,\nthrough centuries of dignified living, so placed that intercourse with\ntheir kind was an easy and delightful thing. They need never doubt\neither their own effect, or the effect of their hospitalities. Sir Nigel\nsaw about him all the people who held enviable place in the county. Some\nof them he had never known, some of them had long ceased to recall his\nexistence. There were those among them who lifted lorgnettes or stuck\nmonocles into their eyes as he passed, asking each other in politely\nsubdued tones who the man was who seemed to be in attendance on Miss\nVanderpoel. Nigel knew this and girded at it internally, while he made\nthe most of his suave smile.\n\nThe distinguished personage who was the chief guest was to be seen at\nthe upper end of the room talking to a tall man with broad shoulders,\nwho was plainly interesting him for the moment. As the Stornham party\npassed on, this person, making his bow, retired, and, as he turned\ntowards them, Sir Nigel recognising him, the agreeable smile was for the\nmoment lost.\n\n\"How in the name of Heaven did Mount Dunstan come here?\" broke from him\nwith involuntary heat.\n\n\"Would it be rash to conclude,\" said Betty, as she returned the bow of a\nvery grand old lady in black velvet and an imposing tiara, \"that he came\nin response to invitation?\"\n\nThe very grand old lady seemed pleased to see her, and, with a royal\nlittle sign, called her to her side. As Betty Vanderpoel was a great\nsuccess with the Mrs. Weldens and old Dobys of village life, she was\nalso a success among grand old ladies. When she stood before them there\nwas a delicate submission in her air which was suggestive of obedience\nto the dignity of their years and state. Strongly conservative and\nrather feudal old persons were much pleased by this. In the present\nirreverent iconoclasm of modern times, it was most agreeable to talk to\na handsome creature who was as beautifully attentive as if she had been\na specially perfect young lady-in-waiting.\n\nThis one even patted Betty's hand a little, when she took it. She was a\ngreat county potentate, who was known as Lady Alanby of Dole--her house\nbeing one of the most ancient and interesting in England.\n\n\"I am glad to see you here to-night,\" she said. \"You are looking very\nnice. But you cannot help that.\"\n\nBetty asked permission to present her sister and brother-in-law. Lady\nAlanby was polite to both of them, but she gave Nigel a rather sharp\nglance through her gold pince-nez as she greeted him.\n\n\"Janey and Mary,\" she said to the two girls nearest her, \"I daresay\nyou will kindly change your chairs and let Lady Anstruthers and Miss\nVanderpoel sit next to me.\"\n\nThe Ladies Jane and Mary Lithcom, who had been ordered about by her from\ntheir infancy, obeyed with polite smiles. They were not particularly\npretty girls, and were of the indigent noble. Jane, who had almost\noverlarge blue eyes, sighed as she reseated herself a few chairs lower\ndown.\n\n\"It does seem beastly unfair,\" she said in a low voice to her sister,\n\"that a girl such as that should be so awfully good-looking. She ought\nto have a turned-up nose.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Mary, \"I have a turned-up nose myself, and I've got\nnothing to balance it.\"\n\n\"Oh, I didn't mean a nice turned-up nose like yours,\" said Jane; \"I\nmeant an ugly one. Of course Lady Alanby wants her for Tommy.\" And her\nmanner was not resigned.\n\n\"What she, or anyone else for that matter,\" disdainfully, \"could want\nwith Tommy, I don't know,\" replied Mary.\n\n\"I do,\" answered Jane obstinately. \"I played cricket with him when I\nwas eight, and I've liked him ever since. It is AWFUL,\" in a smothered\noutburst, \"what girls like us have to suffer.\"\n\nLady Mary turned to look at her curiously.\n\n\"Jane,\" she said, \"are you SUFFERING about Tommy?\"\n\n\"Yes, I am. Oh, what a question to ask in a ballroom! Do you want me to\nburst out crying?\"\n\n\"No,\" sharply, \"look at the Prince. Stare at that fat woman curtsying to\nhim. Stare and then wink your eyes.\"\n\nLady Alanby was talking about Mount Dunstan.\n\n\"Lord Dunholm has given us a lead. He is an old friend of mine, and he\nhas been talking to me about it. It appears that he has been looking\ninto things seriously. Modern as he is, he rather tilts at injustices,\nin a quiet way. He has satisfactorily convinced himself that Lord Mount\nDunstan has been suffering for the sins of the fathers--which must be\nannoying.\"\n\n\"Is Lord Dunholm quite sure of that?\" put in Sir Nigel, with a\nsuggestively civil air.\n\nOld Lady Alanby gave him an unencouraging look.\n\n\"Quite,\" she said. \"He would be likely to be before he took any steps.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" remarked Nigel. \"I knew Lord Tenham, you see.\"\n\nLady Alanby's look was more unencouraging still. She quietly and openly\nput up her glass and stared. There were times when she had not the\nremotest objection to being rude to certain people.\n\n\"I am sorry to hear that,\" she observed. \"There never was any room for\nmistake about Tenham. He is not usually mentioned.\"\n\n\"I do not think this man would be usually mentioned, if everything were\nknown,\" said Nigel.\n\nThen an appalling thing happened. Lady Alanby gazed at him a few\nseconds, and made no reply whatever. She dropped her glass, and turned\nagain to talk to Betty. It was as if she had turned her back on him, and\nSir Nigel, still wearing an amiable exterior, used internally some bad\nlanguage.\n\n\"But I was a fool to speak of Tenham,\" he thought. \"A great fool.\"\n\nA little later Miss Vanderpoel made her curtsy to the exalted guest,\nand was commented upon again by those who looked on. It was not at\nall unnatural that one should find ones eyes following a girl who,\nrepresenting a sort of royal power, should have the good fortune of\npossessing such looks and bearing.\n\nRemembering his child bete noir of the long legs and square, audacious\nlittle face, Nigel Anstruthers found himself restraining a slight grin\nas he looked on at her dancing. Partners flocked about her like bees,\nand Lady Alanby of Dole, and other very grand old or middle-aged ladies\nall found the evening more interesting because they could watch her.\n\n\"She is full of spirit,\" said Lady Alanby, \"and she enjoys herself as a\ngirl should. It is a pleasure to look at her. I like a girl who gets\na magnificent colour and stars in her eyes when she dances. It looks\nhealthy and young.\"\n\nIt was Tommy Miss Vanderpoel was dancing with when her ladyship said\nthis. Tommy was her grandson and a young man of greater rank than\nfortune. He was a nice, frank, heavy youth, who loved a simple county\nlife spent in tramping about with guns, and in friendly hobnobbing with\nthe neighbours, and eating great afternoon teas with people whose jokes\nwere easy to understand, and who were ready to laugh if you tried a joke\nyourself. He liked girls, and especially he liked Jane Lithcom, but\nthat was a weakness his grandmother did not at all encourage, and, as he\ndanced with Betty Vanderpoel, he looked over her shoulder more than once\nat a pair of big, unhappy blue eyes, whose owner sat against the wall.\n\nBetty Vanderpoel herself was not thinking of Tommy. In fact, during\nthis brilliant evening she faced still further developments of her own\nstrange case. Certain new things were happening to her. When she had\nentered the ballroom she had known at once who the man was who stood\nbefore the royal guest--she had known before he bowed low and withdrew.\nAnd her recognition had brought with it a shock of joy. For a few\nmoments her throat felt hot and pulsing. It was true--the things which\nconcerned him concerned her. All that happened to him suddenly became\nher affair, as if in some way they were of the same blood. Nigel's\nslighting of him had infuriated her; that Lord Dunholm had offered him\nfriendship and hospitality was a thing which seemed done to herself,\nand filled her with gratitude and affection; that he should be at this\nplace, on this special occasion, swept away dark things from his path.\nIt was as if it were stated without words that a conservative man of the\nworld, who knew things as they were, having means of reaching truths,\nvouched for him and placed his dignity and firmness at his side.\n\nAnd there was the gladness at the sight of him. It was an overpoweringly\nstrong thing. She had never known anything like it. She had not seen\nhim since Nigel's return, and here he was, and she knew that her life\nquickened in her because they were together in the same room. He had\ncome to them and said a few courteous words, but he had soon gone away.\nAt first she wondered if it was because of Nigel, who at the time was\nmaking himself rather ostentatiously amiable to her. Afterwards she saw\nhim dancing, talking, being presented to people, being, with a tactful\neasiness, taken care of by his host and hostess, and Lord Westholt. She\nwas struck by the graceful magic with which this tactful ease surrounded\nhim without any obviousness. The Dunholms had given a lead, as Lady\nAlanby had said, and the rest were following it and ignoring intervals\nwith reposeful readiness. It was wonderfully well done. Apparently\nthere had been no past at all. All began with this large young man,\nwho, despite his Viking type, really looked particularly well in evening\ndress. Lady Alanby held him by her chair for some time, openly enjoying\nher talk with him, and calling up Tommy, that they might make friends.\n\nAfter a while, Betty said to herself, he would come and ask for a dance.\nBut he did not come, and she danced with one man after another. Westholt\ncame to her several times and had more dances than one. Why did the\nother not come? Several times they whirled past each other, and when\nit occurred they looked--both feeling it an accident--into each other's\neyes.\n\nThe strong and strange thing--that which moves on its way as do birth\nand death, and the rising and setting of the sun--had begun to move in\nthem. It was no new and rare thing, but an ancient and common one--as\ncommon and ancient as death and birth themselves; and part of the law\nas they are. As it comes to royal persons to whom one makes obeisance at\ntheir mere passing by, as it comes to scullery maids in royal kitchens,\nand grooms in royal stables, as it comes to ladies-in-waiting and the\nwomen who serve them, so it had come to these two who had been drawn\nnear to each other from the opposite sides of the earth, and each\nstarted at the touch of it, and withdrew a pace in bewilderment, and\nsome fear.\n\n\"I wish,\" Mount Dunstan was feeling throughout the evening, \"that her\neyes had some fault in their expression--that they drew one less--that\nthey drew ME less. I am losing my head.\"\n\n\"It would be better,\" Betty thought, \"if I did not wish so much that he\nwould come and ask me to dance with him--that he would not keep away so.\nHe is keeping away for a reason. Why is he doing it?\"\n\nThe music swung on in lovely measures, and the dancers swung with it.\nSir Nigel walked dutifully through the Lancers once with his wife, and\nonce with his beautiful sister-in-law. Lady Anstruthers, in her new\nbloom, had not lacked partners, who discovered that she was a childishly\nlight creature who danced extremely well. Everyone was kind to her, and\nthe very grand old ladies, who admired Betty, were absolutely benign\nin their manner. Betty's partners paid ingenuous court to her, and Sir\nNigel found he had not been mistaken in his estimate of the dignity his\nposition of escort and male relation gave to him.\n\nRosy, standing for a moment looking out on the brilliancy and state\nabout her, meeting Betty's eyes, laughed quiveringly.\n\n\"I am in a dream,\" she said.\n\n\"You have awakened from a dream,\" Betty answered.\n\nFrom the opposite side of the room someone was coming towards them, and,\nseeing him, Rosy smiled in welcome.\n\n\"I am sure Lord Mount Dunstan is coming to ask you to dance with him,\"\nshe said. \"Why have you not danced with him before, Betty?\"\n\n\"He has not asked me,\" Betty answered. \"That is the only reason.\"\n\n\"Lord Dunholm and Lord Westholt called at the Mount a few days after\nthey met him at Stornham,\" Rosalie explained in an undertone. \"They\nwanted to know him. Then it seems they found they liked each other. Lady\nDunholm has been telling me about it. She says Lord Dunholm thanks\nyou, because you said something illuminating. That was the word she\nused--'illuminating.' I believe you are always illuminating, Betty.\"\n\nMount Dunstan was certainly coming to them. How broad his shoulders\nlooked in his close-fitting black coat, how well built his whole strong\nbody was, and how steadily he held his eyes! Here and there one sees a\nman or woman who is, through some trick of fate, by nature a compelling\nthing unconsciously demanding that one should submit to some domineering\nattraction. One does not call it domineering, but it is so. This special\ncreature is charged unfairly with more than his or her single share of\nforce. Betty Vanderpoel thought this out as this \"other one\" came to\nher. He did not use the ballroom formula when he spoke to her. He said\nin rather a low voice:\n\n\"Will you dance with me?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered.\n\nLord Dunholm and his wife agreed afterwards that so noticeable a pair\nhad never before danced together in their ballroom. Certainly no pair\nhad ever been watched with quite the same interested curiosity. Some\nonlookers thought it singular that they should dance together at all,\nsome pleased themselves by reflecting on the fact that no other two\ncould have represented with such picturesqueness the opposite poles\nof fate and circumstance. No one attempted to deny that they were an\nextraordinarily striking-looking couple, and that one's eyes followed\nthem in spite of one's self.\n\n\"Taken together they produce an effect that is somehow rather amazing,\"\nold Lady Alanby commented. \"He is a magnificently built man, you know,\nand she is a magnificently built girl. Everybody should look like that.\nMy impression would be that Adam and Eve did, but for the fact that\nneither of them had any particular character. That affair of the apple\nwas so silly. Eve has always struck me as being the kind of woman who,\nif she lived to-day, would run up stupid bills at her dressmakers and\nbe afraid to tell her husband. That wonderful black head of Miss\nVanderpoel's looks very nice poised near Mount Dunstan's dark red one.\"\n\n\"I am glad to be dancing with him,\" Betty was thinking. \"I am glad to be\nnear him.\"\n\n\"Will you dance this with me to the very end,\" asked Mount Dunstan--\"to\nthe very late note?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Betty.\n\nHe had spoken in a low but level voice--the kind of voice whose tone\nplaces a man and woman alone together, and wholly apart from all others\nby whomsoever they are surrounded. There had been no preliminary speech\nand no explanation of the request followed. The music was a perfect\nthing, the brilliant, lofty ballroom, the beauty of colour and sound\nabout them, the jewels and fair faces, the warm breath of flowers in\nthe air, the very sense of royal presence and its accompanying state and\nceremony, seemed merely a naturally arranged background for the strange\nconsciousness each held close and silently--knowing nothing of the mind\nof the other.\n\nThis was what was passing through the man's mind.\n\n\"This is the thing which most men experience several times during their\nlives. It would be reason enough for all the great deeds and all the\ncrimes one hears of. It is an enormous kind of anguish and a fearful\nkind of joy. It is scarcely to be borne, and yet, at this moment, I\ncould kill myself and her, at the thought of losing it. If I had begun\nearlier, would it have been easier? No, it would not. With me it is\nbound to go hard. At twenty I should probably not have been able to keep\nmyself from shouting it aloud, and I should not have known that it was\nonly the working of the Law. 'Only!' Good God, what a fool I am! It is\nbecause it is only the Law that I cannot escape, and must go on to the\nend, grinding my teeth together because I cannot speak. Oh, her smooth\nyoung cheek! Oh, the deep shadows of her lashes! And while we sway round\nand round together, I hold her slim strong body in the hollow of my\narm.\"\n\nIt was, quite possibly, as he thought this that Nigel Anstruthers,\nfollowing him with his eyes as he passed, began to frown. He had been\nwatching the pair as others had, he had seen what others saw, and now he\nhad an idea that he saw something more, and it was something which did\nnot please him. The instinct of the male bestirred itself--the curious\ninstinct of resentment against another man--any other man. And, in\nthis case, Mount Dunstan was not any other man, but one for whom his\nantipathy was personal.\n\n\"I won't have that,\" he said to himself. \"I won't have it.\"\n\n. . . . .\n\nThe music rose and swelled, and then sank into soft breathing, as they\nmoved in harmony together, gliding and swirling as they threaded their\nway among other couples who swirled and glided also, some of them light\nand smiling, some exchanging low-toned speech--perhaps saying words\nwhich, unheard by others, touched on deep things. The exalted guest fell\ninto momentary silence as he looked on, being a man much attracted by\nphysical fineness and temperamental power and charm. A girl like that\nwould bring a great deal to a man and to the country he belonged to. A\ngreat race might be founded on such superbness of physique and health\nand beauty. Combined with abnormal resources, certainly no more could\nbe asked. He expressed something of the kind to Lord Dunholm, who stood\nnear him in attendance.\n\nTo herself Betty was saying: \"That was a strange thing he asked me. It\nis curious that we say so little. I should never know much about him.\nI have no intelligence where he is concerned--only a strong, stupid\nfeeling, which is not like a feeling of my own. I am no longer Betty\nVanderpoel--and I wish to go on dancing with him--on and on--to the last\nnote, as he said.\"\n\nShe felt a little hot wave run over her cheek uncomfortably, and the\nnext instant the big arm tightened its clasp of her--for just one\nsecond--not more than one. She did not know that he, himself, had seen\nthe sudden ripple of red colour, and that the equally sudden contraction\nof the arm had been as unexpected to him and as involuntary as the quick\nwave itself. It had horrified and made him angry. He looked the next\ninstant entirely stiff and cold.\n\n\"He did not know it happened,\" Betty resolved.\n\n\"The music is going to stop,\" said Mount Dunstan. \"I know the waltz. We\ncan get once round the room again before the final chord. It was to be\nthe last note--the very last,\" but he said it quite rigidly, and Betty\nlaughed.\n\n\"Quite the last,\" she answered.\n\nThe music hastened a little, and their gliding whirl became more\nrapid--a little faster--a little faster still--a running sweep of notes,\na big, terminating harmony, and the thing was over.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Mount Dunstan. \"One will have it to remember.\" And his\ntone was slightly sardonic.\n\n\"Yes,\" Betty acquiesced politely.\n\n\"Oh, not you. Only I. I have never waltzed before.\"\n\nBetty turned to look at him curiously.\n\n\"Under circumstances such as these,\" he explained. \"I learned to dance\nat a particularly hideous boys' school in France. I abhorred it. And\nthe trend of my life has made it quite easy for me to keep my\ntwelve-year-old vow that I would never dance after I left the place,\nunless I WANTED to do it, and that, especially, nothing should make\nme waltz until certain agreeable conditions were fulfilled. Waltzing I\napproved of--out of hideous schools. I was a pig-headed, objectionable\nchild. I detested myself even, then.\"\n\nBetty's composure returned to her.\n\n\"I am trusting,\" she remarked, \"that I may secretly regard myself as\none of the agreeable conditions to be fulfilled. Do not dispel my hopes\nroughly.\"\n\n\"I will not,\" he answered. \"You are, in fact, several of them.\"\n\n\"One breathes with much greater freedom,\" she responded.\n\nThis sort of cool nonsense was safe. It dispelled feelings of tenseness,\nand carried them to the place where Sir Nigel and Lady Anstruthers\nawaited them. A slight stir was beginning to be felt throughout the\nballroom. The royal guest was retiring, and soon the rest began to melt\naway. The Anstruthers, who had a long return drive before them, were\namong those who went first.\n\nWhen Lady Anstruthers and her sister returned from the cloak room, they\nfound Sir Nigel standing near Mount Dunstan, who was going also, and\ntalking to him in an amiably detached manner. Mount Dunstan, himself,\ndid not look amiable, or seem to be saying much, but Sir Nigel showed no\nsigns of being disturbed.\n\n\"Now that you have ceased to forswear the world,\" he said as his wife\napproached, \"I hope we shall see you at Stornham. Your visits must not\ncease because we cannot offer you G. Selden any longer.\"\n\nHe had his own reasons for giving the invitation--several of them. And\nthere was a satisfaction in letting the fellow know, casually, that he\nwas not in the ridiculous position of being unaware of what had\noccurred during his absence--that there had been visits--and also the\nobjectionable episode of the American bounder. That the episode had been\nobjectionable, he knew he had adroitly conveyed by mere tone and manner.\n\nMount Dunstan thanked him in the usual formula, and then spoke to Betty.\n\n\"G. Selden left us tremulous and fevered with ecstatic anticipation. He\ncarried your kind letter to Mr. Vanderpoel, next to his heart. His brain\nseemed to whirl at the thought of what 'the boys' would say, when he\narrived with it in New York. You have materialised the dream of his\nlife!\"\n\n\"I have interested my father,\" Betty answered, with a brilliant smile.\n\"He liked the romance of the Reuben S. Vanderpoel who rewarded the saver\nof his life by unbounded orders for the Delkoff.\"\n\n. . . . .\n\nAs their carriage drove away, Sir Nigel bent forward to look out of the\nwindow, and having done it, laughed a little.\n\n\"Mount Dunstan does not play the game well,\" he remarked.\n\nIt was annoying that neither Betty nor his wife inquired what the\ngame in question might be, and that his temperament forced him into\nexplaining without encouragement.\n\n\"He should have 'stood motionless with folded arms,' or something of the\nsort, and 'watched her equipage until it was out of sight.'\"\n\n\"And he did not?\" said Betty\n\n\"He turned on his heel as soon as the door was shut.\"\n\n\"People ought not to do such things,\" was her simple comment. To which\nit seemed useless to reply.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\nFOR LADY JANE\n\nThere is no one thing on earth of such interest as the study of the laws\nof temperament, which impel, support, or entrap into folly and danger\nthe being they rule. As a child, not old enough to give a definite name\nto the thing she watched and pondered on, in child fashion, Bettina\nVanderpoel had thought much on this subject. As she had grown older, she\nhad never been ignorant of the workings of her own temperament, and she\nhad looked on for years at the laws which had wrought in her father's\nbeing--the laws of strength, executive capacity, and that pleasure in\ngreat schemes, which is roused less by a desire for gain than for a\nstrongly-felt necessity for action, resulting in success. She mentally\nfollowed other people on their way, sometimes asking herself how far the\nindividual was to be praised or blamed for his treading of the path he\nseemed to choose. And now there was given her the opportunity to study\nthe workings of the nature of Nigel Anstruthers, which was a curious\nthing.\n\nHe was not an individual to be envied. Never was man more tormented by\nlack of power to control his special devil, at the right moment of time,\nand therefore, never was there one so inevitably his own frustration.\nThis Betty saw after the passing of but a few days, and wondered how far\nhe was conscious or unconscious of the thing. At times it appeared to\nher that he was in a state of unrest--that he was as a man wavering\nbetween lines of action, swayed at one moment by one thought, at another\nby an idea quite different, and that he was harried because he could not\nhold his own with himself.\n\nThis was true. The ball at Dunholm Castle had been enlightening, and\nhad wrought some changes in his points of view. Also other factors had\ninfluenced him. In the first place, the changed atmosphere of Stornham,\nthe fitness and luxury of his surroundings, the new dignity given to his\nposition by the altered aspect of things, rendered external amiability\nmore easy. To ride about the country on a good horse, or drive in a\nsmart phaeton, or suitable carriage, and to find that people who a year\nago had passed him with the merest recognition, saluted him with polite\nintention, was, to a certain degree, stimulating to a vanity which had\nbeen long ill-fed. The power which produced these results should, of\ncourse, have been in his own hands--his money-making father-in-law\nshould have seen that it was his affair to provide for that--but since\nhe had not done so, it was rather entertaining that it should be, for\nthe present, in the hands of this extraordinarily good-looking girl.\n\nHe had begun by merely thinking of her in this manner--as \"this\nextraordinarily good-looking girl,\" and had not, for a moment, hesitated\nbefore the edifying idea of its not being impossible to arrange a lively\nflirtation with her. She was at an age when, in his opinion, girlhood\nwas poised for flight with adventure, and his tastes had not led him\nin the direction of youth which was fastidious. His Riviera episode had\nleft his vanity blistered and requiring some soothing application. His\nlife had worked evil with him, and he had fallen ill on the hands of a\nwoman who had treated him as a shattered, useless thing whose day was\ndone and with whom strength and bloom could not be burdened. He had kept\nhis illness a hidden secret, on his return to Stornham, his one desire\nhaving been to forget--even to disbelieve in it, but dreams of its\nsuggestion sometimes awakened him at night with shudders and cold sweat.\nHe was hideously afraid of death and pain, and he had had monstrous\npain--and while he had lain battling with it, upon his bed in the villa\non the Mediterranean, he had been able to hear, in the garden outside,\nthe low voices and laughter of the Spanish dancer and the healthy,\nstrong young fool who was her new adorer.\n\nWhen he had found himself face to face with Betty in the avenue,\nafter the first leap of annoyance, which had suddenly died down into\nperversely interested curiosity, he could have laughed outright at\nthe novelty and odd unexpectedness of the situation. The ill-mannered,\nimpudently-staring, little New York beast had developed into THIS! Hang\nit! No man could guess what the embryo female creature might result\nin. His mere shakiness of physical condition added strength to her\nattraction. She was like a young goddess of health and life and\nfire; the very spring of her firm foot upon the moss beneath it was a\nstimulating thing to a man whose nerves sprung secret fears upon him.\nThere were sparks between the sweep of her lashes, but she managed to\ncarry herself with the air of being as cool as a cucumber, which gave\nspice to the effort to \"upset\" her. If she did not prove suitably\namenable, there would be piquancy in getting the better of her--in\nstirring up unpleasant little things, which would make it easier for her\nto go away than remain on the spot--if one should end by choosing to get\nrid of her. But, for the moment, he had no desire to get rid of her. He\nwanted to see what she intended to do--to see the thing out, in fact. It\namused him to hear that Mount Dunstan was on her track. There exists\nfor persons of a certain type a pleasure full-fed by the mere sense of\nhaving \"got even\" with an opponent. Throughout his life he had made\na point of \"getting even\" with those who had irritatingly crossed his\npath, or much disliked him. The working out of small or large plans to\nachieve this end had formed one of his most agreeable recreations. He\nhad long owed Mount Dunstan a debt, which he had always meant to pay. He\nhad not intended to forget the episode of the nice little village girl\nwith whom Tenham and himself had been getting along so enormously well,\nwhen the raging young ass had found them out, and made an absurdly\nexaggerated scene, even going so far as threatening to smash the pair of\nthem, marching off to the father and mother, and setting the vicar on,\nand then scratching together--God knows how--money enough to pack the\nlot off to America, where they had since done well. Why should a man\nforgive another who had made him look like a schoolboy and a fool? So,\nto find Mount Dunstan rushing down a steep hill into this thing, was\nedifying. You cannot take much out of a man if you never encounter him.\nIf you meet him, you are provided by Heaven with opportunities. You can\nfind out what he feels most sharply, and what he will suffer most by\nbeing deprived of. His impression was that there was a good deal to be\ngot out of Mount Dunstan. He was an obstinate, haughty devil, and just\nthe fellow to conceal with a fury of pride a score of tender places in\nhis hide.\n\nAt the ball he had seen that the girl's effect had been of a kind which\neven money and good looks uncombined with another thing might not\nhave produced. And she had the other thing--whatsoever it might be. He\nobserved the way in which the Dunholms met and greeted her, he marked\nthe glance of the royal personage, and his manner, when after her\npresentation he conversed with and detained her, he saw the turning\nof heads and exchange of remarks as she moved through the rooms. Most\nespecially, he took in the bearing of the very grand old ladies, led\nby Lady Alanby of Dole. Barriers had thrown themselves down, these\nportentous, rigorous old pussycats admired her, even liked her.\n\n\"Upon my word,\" he said to himself. \"She has a way with her, you know.\nShe is a combination of Ethel Newcome and Becky Sharp. But she is more\nlevel-headed than either of them, There's a touch of Trix Esmond, too.\"\n\nThe sense of the success which followed her, and the gradually-growing\nexcitement of looking on at her light whirls of dance, the carnation\nof her cheek, and the laughter and pleasure she drew about her, had\naffected him in a way by which he was secretly a little exhilarated. He\nwas conscious of a rash desire to force his way through these laughing,\nvaunting young idiots, juggle or snatch their dances away from them, and\nseize on the girl himself. He had not for so long a time been impelled\nby such agreeable folly that he had sometimes felt the stab of the\nthought that he was past it. That it should rise in him again made\nhim feel young. There was nothing which so irritated him against\nMount Dunstan as his own rebelling recognition of the man's youth, the\nstrength of his fine body, his high-held head and clear eye.\n\nThese things and others it was which swayed him, as was plain to Betty\nin the time which followed, to many changes of mood.\n\n\"Are you sorry for a man who is ill and depressed,\" he asked one day,\n\"or do you despise him?\"\n\n\"I am sorry.\"\n\n\"Then be sorry for me.\"\n\nHe had come out of the house to her as she sat on the lawn, under a\nbroad, level-branched tree, and had thrown himself upon a rug with his\nhands clasped behind his head.\n\n\"Are you ill?\"\n\n\"When I was on the Riviera I had a fall.\" He lied simply. \"I strained\nsome muscle or other, and it has left me rather lame. Sometimes I have a\ngood deal of pain.\"\n\n\"I am very sorry,\" said Betty. \"Very.\"\n\nA woman who can be made sorry it is rarely impossible to manage. To\ndwell with pathetic patience on your grievances, if she is weak and\nunintelligent, to deplore, with honest regret, your faults and blunders,\nif she is strong, are not bad ideas.\n\nHe looked at her reflectively.\n\n\"Yes, you are capable of being sorry,\" he decided. For a few moments\nof silence his eyes rested upon the view spread before him. To give the\nexpression of dignified reflection was not a bad idea either.\n\n\"Do you know,\" he said at length, \"that you produce an extraordinary\neffect upon me, Betty?\"\n\nShe was occupying herself by adding a few stitches to one of Rosy's\nancient strips of embroidery, and as she answered, she laid it flat upon\nher knee to consider its effect.\n\n\"Good or bad?\" she inquired, with delicate abstraction.\n\nHe turned his face towards her again--this time quickly.\n\n\"Both,\" he answered. \"Both.\"\n\nHis tone held the flash of a heat which he felt should have startled her\nslightly. But apparently it did not.\n\n\"I do not like 'both,'\" with composed lightness. \"If you had said that\nyou felt yourself develop angelic qualities when you were near me,\nI should feel flattered, and swell with pride. But 'both' leaves me\nunsatisfied. It interferes with the happy little conceit that one is\nan all-pervading, beneficent power. One likes to contemplate a\nlarge picture of one's self--not plain, but coloured--as a wholesale\nreformer.\"\n\n\"I see. Thank you,\" stiffly and flushing. \"You do not believe me.\"\n\nHer effect upon him was such that, for the moment, he found himself\nchoosing to believe that he was in earnest. His desire to impress her\nwith his mood had actually led to this result. She ought to have been\nrather moved--a little fluttered, perhaps, at hearing that she disturbed\nhis equilibrium.\n\n\"You set yourself against me, as a child, Betty,\" he said. \"And you set\nyourself against me now. You will not give me fair play. You might give\nme fair play.\" He dropped his voice at the last sentence, and knew it\nwas well done. A touch of hopelessness is not often lost on a woman.\n\n\"What would you consider fair play?\" she inquired.\n\n\"It would be fair to listen to me without prejudice--to let me explain\nhow it has happened that I have appeared to you a--a blackguard--I have\nno doubt you would call it--and a fool.\" He threw out his hand in an\nimpatient gesture--impatient of himself--his fate--the tricks of bad\nfortune which it implied had made of him a more erring mortal than he\nwould have been if left to himself, and treated decently.\n\n\"Do not put it so strongly,\" with conservative politeness.\n\n\"I don't refuse to admit that I am handicapped by a devil of a\ntemperament. That is an inherited thing.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Betty. \"One of the temperaments one reads about--for which\nno one is to be blamed but one's deceased relatives. After all, that is\ncomparatively easy to deal with. One can just go on doing what one wants\nto do--and then condemn one's grandparents severely.\"\n\nA repellent quality in her--which had also the trick of transforming\nitself into an exasperating attraction--was that she deprived him of the\nluxury he had been most tenacious of throughout his existence. If the\ninjustice of fate has failed to bestow upon a man fortune, good looks\nor brilliance, his exercise of the power to disturb, to enrage those who\ndare not resent, to wound and take the nonsense out of those about him,\nwill, at all events, preclude the possibility of his being passed over\nas a factor not to be considered. If to charm and bestow gives the sense\nof power, to thwart and humiliate may be found not wholly unsatisfying.\n\nBut in her case the inadequacy of the usual methods had forced itself\nupon him. It was as if the dart being aimed at her, she caught it in\nher hand in its flight, broke off its point and threw it lightly aside\nwithout comment. Most women cannot resist the temptation to answer a\nspeech containing a sting or a reproach. It was part of her abnormality\nthat she could let such things go by in a detached silence, which did\nnot express even the germ of comment or opinion upon them. This, he\nsaid, was the result of her beastly sense of security, which, in its\nturn, was the result of the atmosphere of wealth she had breathed since\nher birth. There had been no obstacle which could not be removed for\nher, no law of limitation had laid its rein on her neck. She had not\nbeen taught by her existence the importance of propitiating opinion.\nUnder such conditions, how was fear to be learned? She had not learned\nit. But for the devil in the blue between her lashes, he realised that\nhe should have broken loose long ago.\n\n\"I suppose I deserved that for making a stupid appeal to sympathy,\" he\nremarked. \"I will not do it again.\"\n\nIf she had been the woman who can be gently goaded into reply, she\nwould have made answer to this. But she allowed the observation to\npass, giving it free flight into space, where it lost itself after the\nannoying manner of its kind.\n\n\"Have you any objection to telling me why you decided to come to England\nthis year?\" he inquired, with a casual air, after the pause which she\ndid not fill in.\n\nThe bluntness of the question did not seem to disturb her. She was not\nsorry, in fact, that he had asked it. She let her work lie upon her\nknee, and leaned back in her low garden chair, her hands resting upon\nits wicker arms. She turned on him a clear unprejudiced gaze.\n\n\"I came to see Rosy. I have always been very fond of her. I did not\nbelieve that she had forgotten how much we had loved her, or how\nmuch she had loved us. I knew that if I could see her again I should\nunderstand why she had seemed to forget us.\"\n\n\"And when you saw her, you, of course, decided that I had behaved, to\nquote my own words--like a blackguard and a fool.\"\n\n\"It is, of course, very rude to say you have behaved like a fool,\nbut--if you'll excuse my saying so--that is what has impressed me very\nmuch. Don't you know,\" with a moderation, which singularly drove itself\nhome, \"that if you had been kind to her, and had made her happy, you\ncould have had anything you wished for--without trouble?\"\n\nThis was one of the unadorned facts which are like bullets. Disgustedly,\nhe found himself veering towards an outlook which forced him to admit\nthat there was probably truth in what she said, and he knew he heard\nmore truth as she went on.\n\n\"She would have wanted only what you wanted, and she would not have\nasked much in return. She would not have asked as much as I should. What\nyou did was not businesslike.\" She paused a moment to give thought to\nit. \"You paid too high a price for the luxury of indulging the inherited\ntemperament. Your luxury was not to control it. But it was a bad\ninvestment.\"\n\n\"The figure of speech is rather commercial,\" coldly.\n\n\"It is curious that most things are, as a rule. There is always the\nparallel of profit and loss whether one sees it or not. The profits\nare happiness and friendship--enjoyment of life and approbation. If the\ninherited temperament supplies one with all one wants of such things, it\ncannot be called a loss, of course.\"\n\n\n\"You think, however, that mine has not brought me much?\"\n\n\"I do not know. It is you who know.\"\n\n\"Well,\" viciously, \"there HAS been a sort of luxury in it in lashing out\nwith one's heels, and smashing things--and in knowing that people prefer\nto keep clear.\"\n\nShe lifted her shoulders a little.\n\n\"Then perhaps it has paid.\"\n\n\"No,\" suddenly and fiercely, \"damn it, it has not!\"\n\nAnd she actually made no reply to that.\n\n\"What do you mean to do?\" he questioned as bluntly as before. He knew\nshe would understand what he meant.\n\n\"Not much. To see that Rosy is not unhappy any more. We can prevent\nthat. She was out of repair--as the house was. She is being rebuilt and\ndecorated. She knows that she will be taken care of.\"\n\n\"I know her better than you do,\" with a laugh. \"She will not go away.\nShe is too frightened of the row it would make--of what I should say. I\nshould have plenty to say. I can make her shake in her shoes.\"\n\nBetty let her eyes rest full upon him, and he saw that she was\nsoftly summing him up--quite without prejudice, merely in interested\nspeculation upon the workings of type.\n\n\"You are letting the inherited temperament run away with you at this\nmoment,\" she reflected aloud--her quiet scrutiny almost abstracted. \"It\nwas foolish to say that.\"\n\nHe had known it was foolish two seconds after the words had left his\nlips. But a temper which has been allowed to leap hedges, unchecked\nthroughout life, is in peril of forming a habit of taking them even at\nsuch times as a leap may land its owner in a ditch. This last was what\nher interested eyes were obviously saying. It suited him best at the\nmoment to try to laugh.\n\n\"Don't look at me like that,\" he threw off. \"As if you were calculating\nthat two and two make four.\"\n\n\"No prejudice of mine can induce them to make five or six--or three and\na half,\" she said. \"No prejudice of mine--or of yours.\"\n\nThe two and two she was calculating with were the likelihoods and\nunlikelihoods of the inherited temperament, and the practical powers she\ncould absolutely count on if difficulty arose with regard to Rosy.\n\nHe guessed at this, and began to make calculations himself.\n\nBut there was no further conversation for them, as they were obliged\nto rise to their feet to receive visitors. Lady Alanby of Dole and Sir\nThomas, her grandson, were being brought out of the house to them by\nRosalie.\n\nHe went forward to meet them--his manner that of the graceful host. Lady\nAlanby, having been welcomed by him, and led to the most comfortable,\ntree-shaded chair, found his bearing so elegantly chastened that she\ngazed at him with private curiosity. To her far-seeing and highly\nexperienced old mind it seemed the bearing of a man who was \"up to\nsomething.\" What special thing did he chance to be \"up to\"? His glance\ncertainly lurked after Miss Vanderpoel oddly. Was he falling in unholy\nlove with the girl, under his stupid little wife's very nose?\n\nShe could not, however, give her undivided attention to him, as she\nwished to keep her eye on her grandson and--outrageously enough it\nhappened that just as tea was brought out and Tommy was beginning to\ncheer up and quite come out a little under the spur of the activities of\nhanding bread and butter and cress sandwiches, who should appear but the\ntwo Lithcom girls, escorted by their aunt, Mrs. Manners, with whom they\nlived. As they were orphans without money, if the Manners, who were\nrather well off, had not taken them in, they would have had to go to the\nworkhouse, or into genteel amateur shops, as they were not clever enough\nfor governesses.\n\nMary, with her turned-up nose, looked just about as usual, but Jane had\na new frock on which was exactly the colour of the big, appealing eyes,\nwith their trick of following people about. She looked a little pale and\npathetic, which somehow gave her a specious air of being pretty, which\nshe really was not at all. The swaying young thinness of those very\nslight girls whose soft summer muslins make them look like delicate\nbags tied in the middle with fluttering ribbons, has almost invariably\na foolish attraction for burly young men whose characters are chiefly\nmarked by lack of forethought, and Lady Alanby saw Tommy's robust young\nbody give a sort of jerk as the party of three was brought across the\ngrass. After it he pulled himself together hastily, and looked stiff\nand pink, shaking hands as if his elbow joint was out of order, being at\nonce too loose and too rigid. He began to be clumsy with the bread and\nbutter, and, ceasing his talk with Miss Vanderpoel, fell into silence.\nWhy should he go on talking? he thought. Miss Vanderpoel was a cracking\nhandsome girl, but she was too clever for him, and he had to think\nof all sorts of new things to say when he talked to her. And--well, a\nfellow could never imagine himself stretched out on the grass, puffing\nhappily away at a pipe, with a girl like that sitting near him,\nsmiling--the hot turf smelling almost like hay, the hot blue sky curving\noverhead, and both the girl and himself perfectly happy--chock full\nof joy--though neither of them were saying anything at all. You could\nimagine it with some girls--you DID imagine it when you wakened early on\na summer morning, and lay in luxurious stillness listening to the birds\nsinging like mad.\n\nLady Jane was a nicely-behaved girl, and she tried to keep her\nfollowing blue eyes fixed on the grass, or on Lady Anstruthers, or\nMiss Vanderpoel, but there was something like a string, which sometimes\npulled them in another direction, and once when this had happened--quite\nagainst her will--she was terrified to find Lady Alanby's glass lifted\nand fixed upon her.\n\nAs Lady Alanby's opinion of Mrs. Manners was but a poor one, and as\nMrs. Manners was stricken dumb by her combined dislike and awe of Lady\nAlanby, a slight stiffness might have settled upon the gathering if\nBetty had not made an effort. She applied herself to Lady Alanby and\nMrs. Manners at once, and ended by making them talk to each other. When\nthey left the tea table under the trees to look at the gardens, she\nwalked between them, playing upon the primeval horticultural passions\nwhich dominate the existence of all respectable and normal country\nladies, until the gulf between them was temporarily bridged. This being\nachieved, she adroitly passed them over to Lady Anstruthers, who, Nigel\nobserved with some curiosity, accepted the casual responsibility without\nmanifest discomfiture.\n\nTo the aching Tommy the manner in which, a few minutes later, he found\nhimself standing alone with Jane Lithcom in a path of clipped laurels\nwas almost bewilderingly simple. At the end of the laurel walk was a\npretty peep of the country, and Miss Vanderpoel had brought him to see\nit. Nigel Anstruthers had been loitering behind with Jane and Mary. As\nMiss Vanderpoel turned with him into the path, she stooped and picked a\nblossom from a clump of speedwell growing at the foot of a bit of wall.\n\n\"Lady Jane's eyes are just the colour of this flower,\" she said.\n\n\"Yes, they are,\" he answered, glancing down at the lovely little blue\nthing as she held it in her hand. And then, with a thump of the heart,\n\"Most people do not think she is pretty, but I--\" quite desperately--\"I\nDO.\" His mood had become rash.\n\n\"So do I,\" Betty Vanderpoel answered.\n\nThen the others joined them, and Miss Vanderpoel paused to talk a\nlittle--and when they went on she was with Mary and Nigel Anstruthers,\nand he was with Jane, walking slowly, and somehow the others melted\naway, turning in a perfectly natural manner into a side path. Their own\nslow pace became slower. In fact, in a few moments, they were standing\nquite still between the green walls. Jane turned a little aside, and\npicked off some small leaves, nervously. He saw the muslin on her chest\nlift quiveringly.\n\n\"Oh, little Jane!\" he said in a big, shaky whisper. The following eyes\nincontinently brimmed over. Some shining drops fell on the softness of\nthe blue muslin.\n\n\"Oh, Tommy,\" giving up, \"it's no use--talking at all.\"\n\n\"You mustn't think--you mustn't think--ANYTHING,\" he falteringly\ncommanded, drawing nearer, because it was impossible not to do it.\n\nWhat he really meant, though he did not know how decorously to say it,\nwas that she must not think that he could be moved by any tall beauty,\ntowards the splendour of whose possessions his revered grandmother might\nbe driving him.\n\n\"I am not thinking anything,\" cried Jane in answer. \"But she is\neverything, and I am nothing. Just look at her--and then look at me,\nTommy.\"\n\n\"I'll look at you as long as you'll let me,\" gulped Tommy, and he was\nboy enough and man enough to put a hand on each of her shoulders, and\ndrown his longing in her brimming eyes.\n\n. . . . .\n\nMary and Miss Vanderpoel were talking with a curious intimacy, in\nanother part of the garden, where they were together alone, Sir Nigel\nhaving been reattached to Lady Alanby.\n\n\"You have known Sir Thomas a long time?\" Betty had just said.\n\n\"Since we were children. Jane reminded me at the Dunholms' ball that she\nhad played cricket with him when she was eight.\"\n\n\"They have always liked each other?\" Miss Vanderpoel suggested.\n\nMary looked up at her, and the meeting of their eyes was frank to\nrevelation. But for the clear girlish liking for herself she saw in\nBetty Vanderpoel's, Mary would have known her next speech to be of\nimbecile bluntness. She had heard that Americans often had a queer,\ndelightful understanding of unconventional things. This splendid girl\nwas understanding her.\n\n\"Oh! You SEE!\" she broke out. \"You left them together on purpose!\"\n\n\"Yes, I did.\" And there was a comprehension so deep in her look that\nMary knew it was deeper than her own, and somehow founded on some\nsubtler feeling than her own. \"When two people want so much--care so\nmuch to be together,\" Miss Vanderpoel added quite slowly--even as if the\nwords rather forced themselves from her, \"it seems as if the whole world\nought to help them--everything in the world--the very wind, and rain,\nand sun, and stars--oh, things have no RIGHT to keep them apart.\"\n\nMary stared at her, moved and fascinated. She scarcely knew that she\ncaught at her hand.\n\n\"I have never been in the state that Jane is,\" she poured forth. \"And I\ncan't understand how she can be such a fool, but--but we care about each\nother more than most girls do--perhaps because we have had no people.\nAnd it's the kind of thing there is no use talking against, it seems.\nIt's killing the youngness in her. If it ends miserably, it will be as\nif she had had an illness, and got up from it a faded, done-for spinster\nwith a stretch of hideous years to live. Her blue eyes will look like\nboiled gooseberries, because she will have cried all the colour out of\nthem. Oh! You UNDERSTAND! I see you do.\"\n\nBefore she had finished both Miss Vanderpoel's hands were holding hers.\n\n\"I do! I do,\" she said. And she did, as a year ago she had not known she\ncould. \"Is it Lady Alanby?\" she ventured.\n\n\"Yes. Tommy will be helplessly poor if she does not leave him her money.\nAnd she won't if he makes her angry. She is very determined. She will\nleave it to an awful cousin if she gets in a rage. And Tommy is not\nclever. He could never earn his living. Neither could Jane. They could\nNEVER marry. You CAN'T defy relatives, and marry on nothing, unless you\nare a character in a book.\"\n\n\"Has she liked Lady Jane in the past?\" Miss Vanderpoel asked, as if\nshe was, mentally, rapidly going over the ground, that she might quite\ncomprehend everything.\n\n\"Yes. She used to make rather a pet of her. She didn't like me. She was\ntaken by Jane's meek, attentive, obedient ways. Jane was born a sweet\nlittle affectionate worm. Lady Alanby can't hate her, even now. She just\npushes her out of her path.\"\n\n\"Because?\" said Betty Vanderpoel.\n\nMary prefaced her answer with a brief, half-embarrassed laugh.\n\n\"Because of YOU.\"\n\n\"Because she thinks----?\"\n\n\"I don't see how she can believe he has much of a chance. I don't think\nshe does--but she will never forgive him if he doesn't make a try at\nfinding out whether he has one or not.\"\n\n\"It is very businesslike,\" Betty made observation.\n\nMary laughed.\n\n\"We talk of American business outlook,\" she said, \"but very few of\nus English people are dreamy idealists. We are of a coolness and a\ndaring--when we are dealing with questions of this sort. I don't think\nyou can know the thing you have brought here. You descend on a dull\ncountry place, with your money and your looks, and you simply STAY and\namuse yourself by doing extraordinary things, as if there was no London\nwaiting for you. Everyone knows this won't last. Next season you will\nbe presented, and have a huge success. You will be whirled about in\na vortex, and people will sit on the edge, and cast big strong lines,\nbaited with the most glittering things they can get together. You won't\nbe able to get away. Lady Alanby knows there would be no chance for\nTommy then. It would be too idiotic to expect it. He must make his try\nnow.\"\n\nTheir eyes met again, and Miss Vanderpoel looked neither shocked nor\nangry, but an odd small shadow swept across her face. Mary, of course,\ndid not know that she was thinking of the thing she had realised so\noften--that it was not easy to detach one's self from the fact that\none was Reuben S. Vanderpoel's daughter. As a result of it here one was\nindecently and unwillingly disturbing the lives of innocent, unassuming\nlovers.\n\n\"And so long as Sir Thomas has not tried--and found out--Lady Jane will\nbe made unhappy?\"\n\n\"If he were to let you escape without trying, he would not be forgiven.\nHis grandmother has had her own way all her life.\"\n\n\"But suppose after I went away someone else came?\"\n\nMary shook her head.\n\n\"People like you don't HAPPEN in one neighbourhood twice in a lifetime.\nI am twenty-six and you are the first I have seen.\"\n\n\"And he will only be safe if?\"\n\nMary Lithcom nodded.\n\n\"Yes--IF,\" she answered. \"It's silly--and frightful--but it is true.\"\n\nMiss Vanderpoel looked down on the grass a few moments, and then seemed\nto arrive at a decision.\n\n\"He likes you? You can make him understand things?\" she inquired.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then go and tell him that if he will come here and ask me a direct\nquestion, I will give him a direct answer--which will satisfy Lady\nAlanby.\"\n\nLady Mary caught her breath.\n\n\"Do you know, you are the most wonderful girl I ever saw!\" she\nexclaimed. \"But if you only knew what I feel about Janie!\" And tears\nrushed into her eyes.\n\n\"I feel just the same thing about my sister,\" said Miss Vanderpoel. \"I\nthink Rosy and Lady Jane are rather alike.\"\n\n. . . . .\n\nWhen Tommy tramped across the grass towards her he was turning red and\nwhite by turns, and looking somewhat like a young man who was being\nmarched up to a cannon's mouth. It struck him that it was an American\nkind of thing he was called upon to do, and he was not an American, but\nBritish from the top of his closely-cropped head to the rather thick\nsoles of his boots. He was, in truth, overwhelmed by his sense of his\ninadequacy to the demands of the brilliantly conceived, but unheard-of\nsituation. Joy and terror swept over his being in waves.\n\nThe tall, proud, wood-nymph look of her as she stood under a tree,\nwaiting for him, would have struck his courage dead on the spot and\ncaused him to turn and flee in anguish, if she had not made a little\nmove towards him, with a heavenly, every-day humanness in her eyes. The\nway she managed it was an amazing thing. He could never have managed it\nat all himself.\n\n\nShe came forward and gave him her hand, and really it was HER hand which\nheld his own comparatively steady.\n\n\"It is for Lady Jane,\" she said. \"That prevents it from being ridiculous\nor improper. It is for Lady Jane. Her eyes,\" with a soft-touched laugh,\n\"are the colour of the blue speedwell I showed you. It is the colour of\nbabies' eyes. And hers look as theirs do--as if they asked everybody not\nto hurt them.\"\n\nHe actually fell upon his knee, and bending his head over her hand,\nkissed it half a dozen times with adoration. Good Lord, how she SAW and\nKNEW!\n\n\"If Jane were not Jane, and you were not YOU,\" the words rushed from\nhim, \"it would be the most outrageous--the most impudent thing a man\never had the cheek to do.\"\n\n\"But it is not.\" She did not draw her hand away, and oh, the girlish\nkindness of her smiling, supporting look. \"You came to ask me if----\"\n\n\"If you would marry me, Miss Vanderpoel,\" his head bending over her hand\nagain. \"I beg your pardon, I beg your pardon. Oh Lord, I do.'\n\n\"I thank you for the compliment you pay me,\" she answered. \"I like you\nvery much, Sir Thomas--and I like you just now more than ever--but I\ncould not marry you. I should not make you happy, and I should not be\nhappy myself. The truth is----\" thinking a moment, \"each of us really\nbelongs to a different kind of person. And each of knows the fact.\"\n\n\"God bless you,\" he said. \"I think you know everything in the world a\nwoman can know--and remain an angel.\"\n\nIt was an outburst of eloquence, and she took it in the prettiest\nway--with the prettiest laugh, which had in it no touch of mockery or\ndisbelief in him.\n\n\"What I have said is quite final--if Lady Alanby should inquire,\" she\nsaid--adding rather quickly, \"Someone is coming.\"\n\nIt pleased her to see that he did not hurry to his feet clumsily, but\neven stood upright, with a shade of boyish dignity, and did not release\nher hand before he had bent his head low over it again.\n\nSir Nigel was bringing with him Lady Alanby, Mrs. Manners, and his wife,\nand when Betty met his eyes, she knew at once that he had not made his\nway to this particular garden without intention. He had discovered that\nshe was with Tommy, and it had entertained him to break in upon them.\n\n\"I did not intend to interrupt Sir Thomas at his devotions,\" he remarked\nto her after dinner. \"Accept my apologies.\"\n\n\"It did not matter in the least, thank you,\" said Betty.\n\n. . . . .\n\n\"I am glad to be able to say, Thomas, that you did not look an entire\nfool when you got up from your knees, as we came into the rose garden.\"\nThus Lady Alanby, as their carriage turned out of Stornham village.\n\n\"I'm glad myself,\" Tommy answered.\n\n\"What were you doing there? Even if you were asking her to marry you, it\nwas not necessary to go that far. We are not in the seventeenth century.\"\n\nThen Tommy flushed.\n\n\"I did not intend to do it. I could not help it. She was so--so nice\nabout everything. That girl is an angel. I told her so.\"\n\n\"Very right and proper spirit to approach her in,\" answered the old\nwoman, watching him keenly. \"Was she angel enough to say she would marry\nyou?\"\n\nTommy, for some occult reason, had the courage to stare back into his\ngrandmother's eyes, quite as if he were a man, and not a hobbledehoy,\nexpecting to be bullied.\n\n\"She does not want me,\" he answered. \"And I knew she wouldn't. Why\nshould she? I did what you ordered me to do, and she answered me as I\nknew she would. She might have snubbed me, but she has such a way with\nher--such a way of saying things and understanding, that--that--well, I\nfound myself on one knee, kissing her hand--as if I was being presented\nat court.\"\n\nOld Lady Alanby looked out on the passing landscape.\n\n\"Well, you did your best,\" she summed the matter up at last, \"if you\nwent down on your knees involuntarily. If you had done it on purpose, it\nwould have been unpardonable.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\nRED GODWYN\n\nStornham Court had taken its proper position in the county as a place\nwhich was equal to social exchange in the matter of entertainment. Sir\nNigel and Lady Anstruthers had given a garden party, according to the\ndecrees of the law obtaining in country neighbourhoods. The curiosity\nto behold Miss Vanderpoel, and the change which had been worked in the\nwell-known desolation and disrepair, precluded the possibility of the\nrefusal of any invitations sent, the recipient being in his or her\nright mind, and sound in wind and limb. That astonishing things had been\naccomplished, and that the party was a successful affair, could not but\nbe accepted as truths. Garden parties had been heard of, were a trifle\nrepetitional, and even dull, but at this one there was real music and\nreal dancing, and clever entertainments were given at intervals in a\ngreen-embowered little theatre, erected for the occasion. These were\nagreeable additions to mere food and conversation, which were capable of\npalling.\n\nTo the garden party the Anstruthers did not confine themselves.\nThere were dinner parties at Stornham, and they also were successful\nfunctions. The guests were of those who make for the success of such\nentertainments.\n\n\"I called upon Mount Dunstan this afternoon,\" Sir Nigel said one\nevening, before the first of these dinners. \"He might expect it, as one\nis asking him to dine. I wish him to be asked. The Dunholms have taken\nhim up so tremendously that no festivity seems complete without him.\"\n\nHe had been invited to the garden party, and had appeared, but Betty\nhad seen little of him. It is easy to see little of a guest at an\nout-of-door festivity. In assisting Rosalie to attend to her visitors\nshe had been much occupied, but she had known that she might have seen\nmore of him, if he had intended that it should be so. He did not--for\nreasons of his own--intend that it should be so, and this she became\naware of. So she walked, played in the bowling green, danced and talked\nwith Westholt, Tommy Alanby and others.\n\n\"He does not want to talk to me. He will not, if he can avoid it,\" was\nwhat she said to herself.\n\nShe saw that he rather sought out Mary Lithcom, who was not accustomed\nto receiving special attention. The two walked together, danced\ntogether, and in adjoining chairs watched the performance in the\nembowered theatre. Lady Mary enjoyed her companion very much, but she\nwondered why he had attached himself to her.\n\nBetty Vanderpoel asked herself what they talked to each other about,\nand did not suspect the truth, which was that they talked a good deal of\nherself.\n\n\"Have you seen much of Miss Vanderpoel?\" Lady Mary had begun by asking.\n\n\"I have SEEN her a good deal, as no doubt you have.\"\n\nLady Mary's plain face expressed a somewhat touched reflectiveness.\n\n\"Do you know,\" she said, \"that the garden parties have been a different\nthing this whole summer, just because one always knew one would see her\nat them?\"\n\nA short laugh from Mount Dunstan.\n\n\"Jane and I have gone to every garden party within twenty miles, ever\nsince we left the schoolroom. And we are very tired of them. But this\nyear we have quite cheered up. When we are dressing to go to something\ndull, we say to each other, 'Well, at any rate, Miss Vanderpoel will be\nthere, and we shall see what she has on, and how her things are made,'\nand that's something--besides the fun of watching people make up to her,\nand hearing them talk about the men who want to marry her, and wonder\nwhich one she will take. She will not take anyone in this place,\" the\nnice turned-up nose slightly suggesting a derisive sniff. \"Who is there\nwho is suitable?\"\n\nMount Dunstan laughed shortly again.\n\n\"How do you know I am not an aspirant myself?\" he said. He had a\nmirthless sense of enjoyment in his own brazenness. Only he himself knew\nhow brazen the speech was.\n\nLady Mary looked at him with entire composure.\n\n\"I am quite sure you are not an aspirant for anybody. And I happen\nto know that you dislike moneyed international marriages. You are so\nobviously British that, even if I had not been told that, I should know\nit was true. Miss Vanderpoel herself knows it is true.\"\n\n\"Does she?\"\n\n\"Lady Alanby spoke of it to Sir Nigel, and I heard Sir Nigel tell her.\"\n\n\"Exactly the kind of unnecessary thing he would be likely to repeat.\"\nHe cast the subject aside as if it were a worthless superfluity and\nwent on: \"When you say there is no one suitable, you surely forget Lord\nWestholt.\"\n\n\"Yes, it's true I forgot him for the moment. But--\" with a laugh--\"one\nrather feels as if she would require a royal duke or something of that\nsort.\"\n\n\"You think she expects that kind of thing?\" rather indifferently.\n\n\"She? She doesn't think of the subject. She simply thinks of other\nthings--of Lady Anstruthers and Ughtred, of the work at Stornham and the\nvillage life, which gives her new emotions and interest. She also thinks\nabout being nice to people. She is nicer than any girl I know.\"\n\n\"You feel, however, she has a right to expect it?\" still without more\nthan a casual air of interest.\n\n\"Well, what do you feel yourself?\" said Lady Mary. \"Women who look like\nthat--even when they are not millionairesses--usually marry whom they\nchoose. I do not believe that the two beautiful Miss Gunnings rolled\ninto one would have made anything as undeniable as she is. One has seen\nportraits of them. Look at her as she stands there talking to Tommy and\nLord Dunholm!\"\n\nInternally Mount Dunstan was saying: \"I am looking at her, thank you,\"\nand setting his teeth a little.\n\nBut Lady Mary was launched upon a subject which swept her along with it,\nand she--so to speak--ground the thing in.\n\n\"Look at the turn of her head! Look at her mouth and chin, and her eyes\nwith the lashes sweeping over them when she looks down! You must have\nnoticed the effect when she lifts them suddenly to look at you. It's so\nodd and lovely that it--it almost----\"\n\n\"Almost makes you jump,\" ended Mount Dunstan drily.\n\nShe did not laugh and, in fact, her expression became rather\nsympathetically serious.\n\n\"Ah,\" she said, \"I believe you feel a sort of rebellion against the\nunfairness of the way things are dealt out. It does seem unfair, of\ncourse. It would be perfectly disgraceful--if she were different. I\nhad moments of almost hating her until one day not long ago she did\nsomething so bewitchingly kind and understanding of other people's\nfeelings that I gave up. It was clever, too,\" with a laugh, \"clever and\ndaring. If she were a young man she would make a dashing soldier.\"\n\nShe did not give him the details of the story, but went on to say\nin effect what she had said to Betty herself of the inevitable\nincidentalness of her stay in the country. If she had not evidently come\nto Stornham this year with a purpose, she would have spent the season\nin London and done the usual thing. Americans were generally presented\npromptly, if they had any position--sometimes when they had not. Lady\nAlanby had heard that the fact that she was with her sister had awakened\ncuriosity and people were talking about her.\n\n\"Lady Alanby said in that dry way of hers that the arrival of an\nunmarried American fortune in England was becoming rather like the visit\nof an unmarried royalty. People ask each other what it means and begin\nto arrange for it. So far, only the women have come, but Lady Alanby\nsays that is because the men have had no time to do anything but stay\nat home and make the fortunes. She believes that in another generation\nthere will be a male leisure class, and then it will swoop down too, and\nmarry people. She was very sharp and amusing about it. She said it would\nhelp them to rid themselves of a plethora of wealth and keep them from\nbursting.\"\n\nShe was an amiable, if unsentimental person, Mary Lithcom--and was,\nquite without ill nature, expressing the consensus of public opinion.\nThese young women came to the country with something practical\nto exchange in these days, and as there were men who had certain\nequivalents to offer, so also there were men who had none, and whom\ndecency should cause to stand aside. Mount Dunstan knew that when she\nhad said, \"Who is there who is suitable?\" any shadow of a thought of\nhimself as being in the running had not crossed her mind. And this was\nnot only for the reasons she had had the ready composure to name, but\nfor one less conquerable.\n\nLater, having left Mary Lithcom, he decided to take a turn by himself.\nHe had done his duty as a masculine guest. He had conversed with young\nwomen and old ones, had danced, visited gardens and greenhouses, and\ntaken his part in all things. Also he had, in fact, reached a point when\na few minutes of solitude seemed a good thing. He found himself turning\ninto the clipped laurel walk, where Tommy Alanby had stood with Jane\nLithcom, and he went to the end of it and stood looking out on the view.\n\n\"Look at the turn of her head,\" Lady Mary had said. \"Look at her mouth\nand chin.\" And he had been looking at them the whole afternoon, not\nbecause he had intended to do so, but because it was not possible to\nprevent himself from doing it.\n\nThis was one of the ironies of fate. Orthodox doctrine might suggest\nthat it was to teach him that his past rebellion had been undue.\nOrthodox doctrine was ever ready with these soothing little\nexplanations. He had raged and sulked at Destiny, and now he had been\ngiven something to rage for.\n\n\"No one knows anything about it until it takes him by the throat,\"\nhe was thinking, \"and until it happens to a man he has no right\nto complain. I was not starving before. I was not hungering and\nthirsting--in sight of food and water. I suppose one of the most awful\nthings in the world is to feel this and know it is no use.\"\n\nHe was not in the condition to reason calmly enough to see that there\nmight be one chance in a thousand that it was of use. At such times the\nmost intelligent of men and women lose balance and mental perspicacity.\nA certain degree of unreasoning madness possesses them. They see too\nmuch and too little. There were, it was true, a thousand chances against\nhim, but there was one for him--the chance that selection might be\non his side. He had not that balance of thought left which might have\nsuggested to him that he was a man young and powerful, and filled with\nan immense passion which might count for something. All he saw was\nthat he was notably in the position of the men whom he had privately\ndisdained when they helped themselves by marriage. Such marriages he\nhad held were insults to the manhood of any man and the womanhood of\nany woman. In such unions neither party could respect himself or\nhis companion. They must always in secret doubt each other, fret at\nthemselves, feel distaste for the whole thing. Even if a man loved such\na woman, and the feeling was mutual, to whom would it occur to believe\nit--to see that they were not gross and contemptible? To no one. Would\nit have occurred to himself that such an extenuating circumstance was\npossible? Certainly it would not. Pig-headed pride and obstinacy it\nmight be, but he could not yet face even the mere thought of it--even\nif his whole position had not been grotesque. Because, after all, it was\ngrotesque that he should even argue with himself. She--before his eyes\nand the eyes of all others--the most desirable of women; people dinning\nit in one's ears that she was surrounded by besiegers who waited for her\nto hold out her sceptre, and he--well, what was he! Not that his mental\nattitude was that of a meek and humble lover who felt himself unworthy\nand prostrated himself before her shrine with prayers--he was, on\nthe contrary, a stout and obstinate Briton finding his stubbornly-held\nbeliefs made as naught by a certain obsession--an intolerable longing\nwhich wakened with him in the morning, which sank into troubled sleep\nwith him at night--the longing to see her, to speak to her, to stand\nnear her, to breathe the air of her. And possessed by this--full of the\noverpowering strength of it--was a man likely to go to a woman and say,\n\"Give your life and desirableness to me; and incidentally support me,\nfeed me, clothe me, keep the roof over my head, as if I were an impotent\nbeggar\"?\n\n\"No, by God!\" he said. \"If she thinks of me at all it shall be as a man.\nNo, by God, I will not sink to that!\"\n\n. . . . .\n\nA moving touch of colour caught his eye. It was the rose of a parasol\nseen above the laurel hedge, as someone turned into the walk. He knew\nthe colour of it and expected to see other parasols and hear voices. But\nthere was no sound, and unaccompanied, the wonderful rose-thing moved\ntowards him.\n\n\"The usual things are happening to me,\" was his thought as it advanced.\n\"I am hot and cold, and just now my heart leaped like a rabbit. It would\nbe wise to walk off, but I shall not do it. I shall stay here, because\nI am no longer a reasoning being. I suppose that a horse who refuses to\nback out of his stall when his stable is on fire feels something of the\nsame thing.\"\n\nWhen she saw him she made an involuntary-looking pause, and then\nrecovering herself, came forward.\n\n\"I seem to have come in search of you,\" she said. \"You ought to be\nshowing someone the view really--and so ought I.\"\n\n\"Shall we show it to each other?\" was his reply.\n\n\"Yes.\" And she sat down on the stone seat which had been placed for the\ncomfort of view lovers. \"I am a little tired--just enough to feel that\nto slink away for a moment alone would be agreeable. It IS slinking to\nleave Rosalie to battle with half the county. But I shall only stay a\nfew minutes.\"\n\nShe sat still and gazed at the beautiful lands spread before her, but\nthere was no stillness in her mind, neither was there stillness in his.\nHe did not look at the view, but at her, and he was asking himself what\nhe should be saying to her if he were such a man as Westholt. Though\nhe had boldness enough, he knew that no man--even though he is free to\nspeak the best and most passionate thoughts of his soul--could be sure\nthat he would gain what he desired. The good fortune of Westholt, or of\nany other, could but give him one man's fair chance.\n\nBut having that chance, he knew he should not relinquish it soon. There\nswept back into his mind the story of the marriage of his ancestor, Red\nGodwyn, and he laughed low in spite of himself.\n\nMiss Vanderpoel looked up at him quickly.\n\n\"Please tell me about it, if it is very amusing,\" she said.\n\n\"I wonder if it will amuse you,\" was his answer. \"Do you like savage\nromance?\"\n\n\"Very much.\"\n\nIt might seem a propos de rien, but he did not care in the least. He\nwanted to hear what she would say.\n\n\"An ancestor of mine--a certain Red Godwyn--was a barbarian immensely to\nmy taste. He became enamoured of rumours of the beauty of the daughter\nand heiress of his bitterest enemy. In his day, when one wanted a thing,\none rode forth with axe and spear to fight for it.\"\n\n\"A simple and alluring method,\" commented Betty. \"What was her name?\"\n\nShe leaned in light ease against the stone back of her seat, the rose\nlight cast by her parasol faintly flushed her. The silence of their\nretreat seemed accentuated by its background of music from the gardens.\nThey smiled a second bravely into each other's eyes, then their glances\nbecame entangled, as they had done for a moment when they had stood\ntogether in Mount Dunstan park. For one moment each had been held\nprisoner then--now it was for longer.\n\n\"Alys of the Sea-Blue Eyes.\"\n\nBetty tried to release herself, but could not.\n\n\"Sometimes the sea is grey,\" she said.\n\nHis own eyes were still in hers.\n\n\"Hers were the colour of the sea on a day when the sun shines on it,\nand there are large fleece-white clouds floating in the blue above. They\nsparkled and were often like bluebells under water.\"\n\n\"Bluebells under water sounds entrancing,\" said Betty.\n\nHe caught his breath slightly.\n\n\"They were--entrancing,\" he said. \"That was evidently the devil of\nit--saving your presence.\"\n\n\"I have never objected to the devil,\" said Betty. \"He is an energetic,\nhard-working creature and paints himself an honest black. Please tell me\nthe rest.\"\n\n\"Red Godwyn went forth, and after a bloody fight took his enemy's\ncastle. If we still lived in like simple, honest times, I should take\nDunholm Castle in the same way. He also took Alys of the Eyes and bore\nher away captive.\"\n\n\"From such incidents developed the germs of the desire for female\nsuffrage,\" Miss Vanderpoel observed gently.\n\n\"The interest of the story lies in the fact that apparently the savage\nwas either epicure or sentimentalist, or both. He did not treat the lady\nill. He shut her in a tower chamber overlooking his courtyard, and after\nallowing her three days to weep, he began his barbarian wooing. Arraying\nhimself in splendour he ordered her to appear before him. He sat upon\nthe dais in his banquet hall, his retainers gathered about him--a great\nfeast spread. In archaic English we are told that the board groaned\nbeneath the weight of golden trenchers and flagons. Minstrels played and\nsang, while he displayed all his splendour.\"\n\n\"They do it yet,\" said Miss Vanderpoel, \"in London and New York and\nother places.\"\n\n\"The next day, attended by his followers, he took her with him to ride\nover his lands. When she returned to her tower chamber she had learned\nhow powerful and great a chieftain he was. She 'laye softely' and was\nattended by many maidens, but she had no entertainment but to look\nout upon the great green court. There he arranged games and trials of\nstrength and skill, and she saw him bigger, stronger, and more splendid\nthan any other man. He did not even lift his eyes to her window. He also\nsent her daily a rich gift.\"\n\n\"How long did this go on?\"\n\n\"Three months. At the end of that time he commanded her presence again\nin his banquet hall. He told her the gates were opened, the drawbridge\ndown and an escort waiting to take her back to her father's lands, if\nshe would.\"\n\n\"What did she do?\"\n\n\"She looked at him long--and long. She turned proudly away--in the\nsea-blue eyes were heavy and stormy tears, which seeing----\"\n\n\"Ah, he saw them?\" from Miss Vanderpoel.\n\n\"Yes. And seizing her in his arms caught her to his breast, calling for\na priest to make them one within the hour. I am quoting the chronicle. I\nwas fifteen when I read it first.\"\n\n\"It is spirited,\" said Betty, \"and Red Godwyn was almost modern in his\nmethods.\"\n\nWhile professing composure and lightness of mood, the spell which works\nbetween two creatures of opposite sex when in such case wrought in them\nand made them feel awkward and stiff. When each is held apart from\nthe other by fate, or will, or circumstance, the spell is a stupefying\nthing, deadening even the clearness of sight and wit.\n\n\"I must slink back now,\" Betty said, rising. \"Will you slink back with\nme to give me countenance? I have greatly liked Red Godwyn.\"\n\nSo it occurred that when Nigel Anstruthers saw them again it was as they\ncrossed the lawn together, and people looked up from ices and cups of\ntea to follow their slow progress with questioning or approving eyes.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV\n\nTHE TIDAL WAVE\n\nThere was only one man to speak to, and it being the nature of the\nbeast--so he harshly put it to himself--to be absolutely impelled to\nspeech at such times, Mount Dunstan laid bare his breast to him, tearing\naside all the coverings pride would have folded about him. The man was,\nof course, Penzance, and the laying bare was done the evening after the\nstory of Red Godwyn had been told in the laurel walk.\n\nThey had driven home together in a profound silence, the elder man as\ndeep in thought as the younger one. Penzance was thinking that there\nwas a calmness in having reached sixty and in knowing that the pain and\nhunger of earlier years would not tear one again. And yet, he himself\nwas not untorn by that which shook the man for whom his affection had\ngrown year by year. It was evidently very bad--very bad, indeed. He\nwondered if he would speak of it, and wished he would, not because he\nhimself had much to say in answer, but because he knew that speech would\nbe better than hard silence.\n\n\"Stay with me to-night,\" Mount Dunstan said, as they drove through the\navenue to the house. \"I want you to dine with me and sit and talk late.\nI am not sleeping well.\"\n\nThey often dined together, and the vicar not infrequently slept at the\nMount for mere companionship's sake. Sometimes they read, sometimes went\nover accounts, planned economies, and balanced expenditures. A chamber\nstill called the Chaplain's room was always kept in readiness. It had\nbeen used in long past days, when a household chaplain had sat below\nthe salt and left his patron's table before the sweets were served.\nThey dined together this night almost as silently as they had driven\nhomeward, and after the meal they went and sat alone in the library.\n\nThe huge room was never more than dimly lighted, and the far-off corners\nseemed more darkling than usual in the insufficient illumination of the\nfar from brilliant lamps. Mount Dunstan, after standing upon the hearth\nfor a few minutes smoking a pipe, which would have compared ill with old\nDoby's Sunday splendour, left his coffee cup upon the mantel and began\nto tramp up and down--out of the dim light into the shadows, back out of\nthe shadows into the poor light.\n\n\"You know,\" he said, \"what I think about most things--you know what I\nfeel.\"\n\n\"I think I do.\"\n\n\"You know what I feel about Englishmen who brand themselves as half men\nand marked merchandise by selling themselves and their houses and their\nblood to foreign women who can buy them. You know how savage I have been\nat the mere thought of it. And how I have sworn----\"\n\n\"Yes, I know what you have sworn,\" said Mr. Penzance.\n\nIt struck him that Mount Dunstan shook and tossed his head rather like a\nbull about to charge an enemy.\n\n\"You know how I have felt myself perfectly within my rights when I\nblackguarded such men and sneered at such women--taking it for granted\nthat each was merchandise of his or her kind and beneath contempt. I am\nnot a foul-mouthed man, but I have used gross words and rough ones to\ndescribe them.\"\n\n\"I have heard you.\"\n\nMount Dunstan threw back his head with a big, harsh laugh. He came out\nof the shadow and stood still.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"I am in love--as much in love as any lunatic ever\nwas--with the daughter of Reuben S. Vanderpoel. There you are--and there\n_I_ am!\"\n\n\"It has seemed to me,\" Penzance answered, \"that it was almost\ninevitable.\"\n\n\"My condition is such that it seems to ME that it would be inevitable in\nthe case of any man. When I see another man look at her my blood races\nthrough my veins with an awful fear and a wicked heat. That will show\nyou the point I have reached.\" He walked over to the mantelpiece and\nlaid his pipe down with a hand Penzance saw was unsteady. \"In turning\nover the pages of the volume of Life,\" he said, \"I have come upon the\nBook of Revelations.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" Penzance said.\n\n\"Until one has come upon it one is an inchoate fool,\" Mount Dunstan went\non. \"And afterwards one is--for a time at least--a sort of madman raving\nto one's self, either in or out of a straitjacket--as the case may be. I\nam wearing the jacket--worse luck! Do you know anything of the state of\na man who cannot utter the most ordinary words to a woman without being\nconscious that he is making mad love to her? This afternoon I found\nmyself telling Miss Vanderpoel the story of Red Godwyn and Alys of the\nSea-Blue Eyes. I did not make a single statement having any connection\nwith myself, but throughout I was calling on her to think of herself and\nof me as of those two. I saw her in my own arms, with the tears of Alys\non her lashes. I was making mad love, though she was unconscious of my\ndoing it.\"\n\n\"How do you know she was unconscious?\" remarked Mr. Penzance. \"You are a\nvery strong man.\"\n\nMount Dunstan's short laugh was even a little awful, because it meant so\nmuch. He let his forehead drop a moment on to his arms as they rested on\nthe mantelpiece.\n\n\"Oh, my God!\" he said. But the next instant his head lifted itself. \"It\nis the mystery of the world--this thing. A tidal wave gathering itself\nmountain high and crashing down upon one's helplessness might be as\neasily defied. It is supposed to disperse, I believe. That has been said\nso often that there must be truth in it. In twenty or thirty or forty\nyears one is told one will have got over it. But one must live through\nthe years--one must LIVE through them--and the chief feature of one's\nmadness is that one is convinced that they will last forever.\"\n\n\"Go on,\" said Mr. Penzance, because he had paused and stood biting his\nlip. \"Say all that you feel inclined to say. It is the best thing you\ncan do. I have never gone through this myself, but I have seen and known\nthe amazingness of it for many years. I have seen it come and go.\"\n\n\"Can you imagine,\" Mount Dunstan said, \"that the most damnable thought\nof all--when a man is passing through it--is the possibility of its\nGOING? Anything else rather than the knowledge that years could change\nor death could end it! Eternity seems only to offer space for it. One\nknows--but one does not believe. It does something to one's brain.\"\n\n\"No scientist, howsoever profound, has ever discovered what,\" the vicar\nmused aloud.\n\n\"The Book of Revelations has shown to me how--how MAGNIFICENT life might\nbe!\" Mount Dunstan clenched and unclenched his hands, his eyes flashing.\n\"Magnificent--that is the word. To go to her on equal ground to take her\nhands and speak one's passion as one would--as her eyes answered. Oh,\none would know! To bring her home to this place--having made it as it\nonce was--to live with her here--to be WITH her as the sun rose and set\nand the seasons changed--with the joy of life filling each of them. SHE\nis the joy of Life--the very heart of it. You see where I am--you see!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Penzance answered. He saw, and bowed his head, and Mount Dunstan\nknew he wished him to continue.\n\n\"Sometimes--of late--it has been too much for me and I have given free\nrein to my fancy--knowing that there could never be more than fancy.\nI was doing it this afternoon as I watched her move about among the\npeople. And Mary Lithcom began to talk about her.\" He smiled a grim\nsmile. \"Perhaps it was an intervention of the gods to drag me down from\nmy impious heights. She was quite unconscious that she was driving\nhome facts like nails--the facts that every man who wanted money wanted\nReuben S. Vanderpoel's daughter--and that the young lady, not being\ndull, was not unaware of the obvious truth! And that men with prizes\nto offer were ready to offer them in a proper manner. Also that she was\nonly a brilliant bird of passage, who, in a few months, would be caught\nin the dazzling net of the great world. And that even Lord Westholt\nand Dunholm Castle were not quite what she might expect. Lady Mary was\nsincerely interested. She drove it home in her ardour. She told me to\nLOOK at her--to LOOK at her mouth and chin and eyelashes--and to make\nnote of what she stood for in a crowd of ordinary people. I could have\nlaughed aloud with rage and self-mockery.\"\n\nMr. Penzance was resting his forehead on his hand, his elbow on his\nchair's arm.\n\n\"This is profound unhappiness,\" he said. \"It is profound unhappiness.\"\n\nMount Dunstan answered by a brusque gesture.\n\n\"But it will pass away,\" went on Penzance, \"and not as you fear it\nmust,\" in answer to another gesture, fiercely impatient. \"Not that way.\nSome day--or night--you will stand here together, and you will tell her\nall you have told me. I KNOW it will be so.\"\n\n\"What!\" Mount Dunstan cried out. But the words had been spoken with such\nabsolute conviction that he felt himself become pale.\n\nIt was with the same conviction that Penzance went on.\n\n\"I have spent my quiet life in thinking of the forces for which we find\nno explanation--of the causes of which we only see the effects. Long ago\nin looking at you in one of my pondering moments I said to myself that\nYOU were of the Primeval Force which cannot lose its way--which sweeps\na clear pathway for itself as it moves--and which cannot be held back.\nI said to you just now that because you are a strong man you cannot be\nsure that a woman you are--even in spite of yourself--making mad love\nto, is unconscious that you are doing it. You do not know what your\nstrength lies in. I do not, the woman does not, but we must all feel\nit, whether we comprehend it or no. You said of this fine creature, some\ntime since, that she was Life, and you have just said again something of\nthe same kind. It is quite true. She is Life, and the joy of it. You are\ntwo strong forces, and you are drawing together.\"\n\nHe rose from his chair, and going to Mount Dunstan put his hand on his\nshoulder, his fine old face singularly rapt and glowing.\n\n\"She is drawing you and you are drawing her, and each is too strong to\nrelease the other. I believe that to be true. Both bodies and souls do\nit. They are not separate things. They move on their way as the stars\ndo--they move on their way.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Mount Dunstan's eyes looked into his fixedly. Then they\nturned aside and looked down upon the mantel against which he was\nleaning. He aimlessly picked up his pipe and laid it down again. He was\npaler than before, but he said no single word.\n\n\"You think your reasons for holding aloof from her are the reasons of a\nman.\" Mr. Penzance's voice sounded to him remote. \"They are the reasons\nof a man's pride--but that is not the strongest thing in the world. It\nonly imagines it is. You think that you cannot go to her as a luckier\nman could. You think nothing shall force you to speak. Ask yourself\nwhy. It is because you believe that to show your heart would be to place\nyourself in the humiliating position of a man who might seem to her and\nto the world to be a base fellow.\"\n\n\"An impudent, pushing, base fellow,\" thrust in Mount Dunstan fiercely.\n\"One of a vulgar lot. A thing fancying even its beggary worth buying.\nWhat has a man--whose very name is hung with tattered ugliness--to\noffer?\"\n\nPenzance's hand was still on his shoulder and his look at him was long.\n\n\"His very pride,\" he said at last, \"his very obstinacy and haughty,\nstubborn determination. Those broken because the other feeling is the\nstronger and overcomes him utterly.\"\n\nA flush leaped to Mount Dunstan's forehead. He set both elbows on the\nmantel and let his forehead fall on his clenched fists. And the savage\nBriton rose in him.\n\n\"No!\" he said passionately. \"By God, no!\"\n\n\"You say that,\" said the older man, \"because you have not yet reached\nthe end of your tether. Unhappy as you are, you are not unhappy\nenough. Of the two, you love yourself the more--your pride and your\nstubbornness.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" between his teeth. \"I suppose I retain yet a sort of respect--and\naffection--for my pride. May God leave it to me!\"\n\nPenzance felt himself curiously exalted; he knew himself unreasoningly\npassing through an oddly unpractical, uplifted moment, in whose\nimpelling he singularly believed.\n\n\"You are drawing her and she is drawing you,\" he said. \"Perhaps you drew\neach other across seas. You will stand here together and you will tell\nher of this--on this very spot.\"\n\nMount Dunstan changed his position and laughed roughly, as if to rouse\nhimself. He threw out his arm in a big, uneasy gesture, taking in the\nroom.\n\n\"Oh, come,\" he said. \"You talk like a seer. Look about you. Look! I am\nto bring her here!\"\n\n\"If it is the primeval thing she will not care. Why should she?\"\n\n\"She! Bring a life like hers to this! Or perhaps you mean that her own\nwealth might make her surroundings becoming--that a man would endure\nthat?\"\n\n\"If it is the primeval thing, YOU would not care. You would have\nforgotten that you two had ever lived an hour apart.\"\n\nHe spoke with a deep, moved gravity--almost as if he were speaking of\nthe first Titan building of the earth. Mount Dunstan staring at his\ndelicate, insistent, elderly face, tried to laugh again--and failed\nbecause the effort seemed actually irreverent. It was a singular\nhypnotic moment, indeed. He himself was hypnotised. A flashlight of\nnew vision blazed before him and left him dumb. He took up his pipe\nhurriedly, and with still unsteady fingers began to refill it. When it\nwas filled he lighted it, and then without a word of answer left the\nhearth and began to tramp up and down the room again--out of the dim\nlight into the shadows, back out of the shadows and into the dim light\nagain, his brow working and his teeth holding hard his amber mouthpiece.\n\nThe morning awakening of a normal healthy human creature should be a\njoyous thing. After the soul's long hours of release from the burden of\nthe body, its long hours spent--one can only say in awe at the mystery\nof it, \"away, away\"--in flight, perhaps, on broad, tireless wings,\nbeating softly in fair, far skies, breathing pure life, to be brought\nback to renew the strength of each dawning day; after these hours of\nquiescence of limb and nerve and brain, the morning life returning\nshould unseal for the body clear eyes of peace at least. In time to\ncome this will be so, when the soul's wings are stronger, the body more\nattuned to infinite law and the race a greater power--but as yet it\noften seems as though the winged thing came back a lagging and reluctant\nrebel against its fate and the chain which draws it back a prisoner to\nits toil.\n\nIt had seemed so often to Mount Dunstan--oftener than not. Youth\nshould not know such awakening, he was well aware; but he had known it\nsometimes even when he had been a child, and since his return from his\nill-starred struggle in America, the dull and reluctant facing of the\nday had become a habit. Yet on the morning after his talk with his\nfriend--the curious, uplifted, unpractical talk which had seemed to\nhypnotise him--he knew when he opened his eyes to the light that he had\nawakened as a man should awake--with an unreasoning sense of pleasure\nin the life and health of his own body, as he stretched mighty limbs,\nstrong after the night's rest, and feeling that there was work to be\ndone. It was all unreasoning--there was no more to be done than on those\nother days which he had wakened to with bitterness, because they seemed\nuseless and empty of any worth--but this morning the mere light of the\nsun was of use, the rustle of the small breeze in the leaves, the\nsoft floating past of the white clouds, the mere fact that the great\nblind-faced, stately house was his own, that he could tramp far over\nlands which were his heritage, unfed though they might be, and that the\nvery rustics who would pass him in the lanes were, so to speak, his own\npeople: that he had name, life, even the common thing of hunger for his\nmorning food--it was all of use.\n\nAn alluring picture--of a certain deep, clear bathing pool in the park\nrose before him. It had not called to him for many a day, and now he saw\nits dark blueness gleam between flags and green rushes in its encircling\nthickness of shrubs and trees.\n\nHe sprang from his bed, and in a few minutes was striding across the\ngrass of the park, his towels over his arm, his head thrown back as he\ndrank in the freshness of the morning-scented air. It was scented with\ndew and grass and the breath of waking trees and growing things; early\ntwitters and thrills were to be heard here and there, insisting on\nmorning joyfulness; rabbits frisked about among the fine-grassed\nhummocks of their warren and, as he passed, scuttled back into their\nholes, with a whisking of short white tails, at which he laughed with\nfriendly amusement. Cropping stags lifted their antlered heads, and\nfawns with dappled sides and immense lustrous eyes gazed at him without\nactual fear, even while they sidled closer to their mothers. A skylark\nspringing suddenly from the grass a few yards from his feet made him\nstop short once and stand looking upward and listening. Who could pass\nby a skylark at five o'clock on a summer's morning--the little, heavenly\nlight-heart circling and wheeling, showering down diamonds, showering\ndown pearls, from its tiny pulsating, trilling throat?\n\n\"Do you know why they sing like that? It is because all but the joy of\nthings has been kept hidden from them. They knew nothing but life and\nflight and mating, and the gold of the sun. So they sing.\" That she had\nonce said.\n\nHe listened until the jewelled rain seemed to have fallen into his soul.\nThen he went on his way smiling as he knew he had never smiled in his\nlife before. He knew it because he realised that he had never before\nfelt the same vigorous, light normality of spirit, the same sense of\nbeing as other men. It was as though something had swept a great clear\nspace about him, and having room for air he breathed deep and was glad\nof the commonest gifts of being.\n\nThe bathing pool had been the greatest pleasure of his uncared-for\nboyhood. No one knew which long passed away Mount Dunstan had made it.\nThe oldest villager had told him that it had \"allus ben there,\" even in\nhis father's time. Since he himself had known it he had seen that it was\nkept at its best.\n\nIts dark blue depths reflected in their pellucid clearness the water\nplants growing at its edge and the enclosing shrubs and trees. The turf\nbordering it was velvet-thick and green, and a few flag-steps led down\nto the water. Birds came there to drink and bathe and preen and dress\ntheir feathers. He knew there were often nests in the bushes--sometimes\nthe nests of nightingales who filled the soft darkness or moonlight of\nearly June with the wonderfulness of nesting song. Sometimes a straying\nfawn poked in a tender nose, and after drinking delicately stole away,\nas if it knew itself a trespasser.\n\nTo undress and plunge headlong into the dark sapphire water was a\nrapturous thing. He swam swiftly and slowly by turns, he floated,\nlooking upward at heaven's blue, listening to birds' song and inhaling\nall the fragrance of the early day. Strength grew in him and life pulsed\nas the water lapped his limbs. He found himself thinking with pleasure\nof a long walk he intended to take to see a farmer he must talk to about\nhis hop gardens; he found himself thinking with pleasure of other things\nas simple and common to everyday life--such things as he ordinarily\nfaced merely because he must, since he could not afford an experienced\nbailiff. He was his own bailiff, his own steward, merely, he had often\nthought, an unsuccessful farmer of half-starved lands. But this morning\nneither he nor they seemed so starved, and--for no reason--there was a\nfuture of some sort.\n\nHe emerged from his pool glowing, the turf feeling like velvet beneath\nhis feet, a fine light in his eyes.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, throwing out his arms in a lordly stretch of physical\nwell-being, \"it might be a magnificent thing--mere strong living. THIS\nis magnificent.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI\n\nBY THE ROADSIDE EVERYWHERE\n\nHis breakfast and the talk over it with Penzance seemed good things. It\nsuddenly had become worth while to discuss the approaching hop harvest\nand the yearly influx of the hop pickers from London. Yesterday the\nsubject had appeared discouraging enough. The great hop gardens of the\nestate had been in times past its most prolific source of agricultural\nrevenue and the boast and wonder of the hop-growing county. The neglect\nand scant food of the lean years had cost them their reputation. Each\nseason they had needed smaller bands of \"hoppers,\" and their standard\nhad been lowered. It had been his habit to think of them gloomily, as\nof hopeless and irretrievable loss. Because this morning, for a remote\nreason, the pulse of life beat strong in him he was taking a new view.\nMight not study of the subject, constant attention and the application\nof all available resource to one end produce appreciable results? The\nidea presented itself in the form of a thing worth thinking of.\n\n\"It would provide an outlook and give one work to do,\" he put it to his\ncompanion. \"To have a roof over one's head, a sound body, and work to\ndo, is not so bad. Such things form the whole of G. Selden's cheerful\naim. His spirit is alight within me. I will walk over and talk to\nBolter.\"\n\nBolter was a farmer whose struggle to make ends meet was almost too much\nfor him. Holdings whose owners, either through neglect or lack of money,\nhave failed to do their duty as landlords in the matter of repairs of\nfarmhouses, outbuildings, fences, and other things, gradually fall into\npoor hands. Resourceful and prosperous farmers do not care to hold lands\nunder unprosperous landlords. There were farms lying vacant on the Mount\nDunstan estate, there were others whose tenants were uncertain rent\npayers or slipshod workers or dishonest in small ways. Waste or sale\nof the fertiliser which should have been given to the soil as its due,\nneglect in the case of things whose decay meant depreciation of property\nand expense to the landlord, were dishonesties. But Mount Dunstan knew\nthat if he turned out Thorn and Fittle, whom no watching could wholly\nfrustrate in their tricks, Under Mount Farm and Oakfield Rise would\nstand empty for many a year. But for his poverty Bolter would have been\na good tenant enough. He was in trouble now because, though his hops\npromised well, he faced difficulties in the matter of \"pickers.\" Last\nyear he had not been able to pay satisfactory prices in return for\nlabour, and as a result the prospect of securing good workers was an\nunpromising one.\n\nThe hordes of men, women, and children who flock year after year to\nthe hop-growing districts know each other. They learn also which may\nbe called the good neighbourhoods and which the bad; the gardens whose\nholders are considered satisfactory as masters, and those who are\nundesirable. They know by experience or report where the best \"huts\" are\nprovided, where tents are supplied, and where one must get along as one\ncan.\n\nGenerally the regular flocks are under a \"captain,\" who gathers his\nfollowers each season, manages them and looks after their interests and\ntheir employers'. In some cases the same captain brings his regiment to\nthe same gardens year after year, and ends by counting himself as of the\nsoil and almost of the family of his employer. Each hard, thick-fogged\nwinter they fight through in their East End courts and streets, they\nlook forward to the open-air weeks spent between long, narrow green\ngroves of tall garlanded poles, whose wreathings hang thick with fresh\nand pungent-scented hop clusters. Children play \"'oppin\" in dingy rooms\nand alleys, and talk to each other of days when the sun shone hot and\nbirds were singing and flowers smelling sweet in the hedgerows; of\nothers when the rain streamed down and made mud of the soft earth, and\nyet there was pleasure in the gipsying life, and high cheer in the fire\nof sticks built in the field by some bold spirit, who hung over it a\ntin kettle to boil for tea. They never forgot the gentry they had caught\nsight of riding or driving by on the road, the parson who came to talk,\nand the occasional groups of ladies from the \"great house\" who came into\nthe gardens to walk about and look at the bins and ask queer questions\nin their gentry-sounding voices. They never knew anything, and they\nalways seemed to be entertained. Sometimes there were enterprising,\nlaughing ones, who asked to be shown how to strip the hops into the\nbins, and after being shown played at the work for a little while,\ntaking off their gloves and showing white fingers with rings on. They\nalways looked as if they had just been washed, and as if all of their\nclothes were fresh from the tub, and when anyone stood near them it\nwas observable that they smelt nice. Generally they gave pennies to the\nchildren before they left the garden, and sometimes shillings to the\nwomen. The hop picking was, in fact, a wonderful blend of work and\nholiday combined.\n\nMount Dunstan had liked the \"hopping\" from his first memories of it. He\ncould recall his sensations of welcoming a renewal of interesting things\nwhen, season after season, he had begun to mark the early stragglers on\nthe road. The stragglers were not of the class gathered under captains.\nThey were derelicts--tramps who spent their summers on the highways and\ntheir winters in such workhouses as would take them in; tinkers, who\ndiffer from the tramps only because sometimes they owned a rickety cart\nfull of strange household goods and drunken tenth-hand perambulators\npiled with dirty bundles and babies, these last propelled by robust or\nworn-out, slatternly women, who sat by the small roadside fire stirring\nthe battered pot or tending the battered kettle, when resting time had\ncome and food must be cooked. Gipsies there were who had cooking fires\nalso, and hobbled horses cropping the grass. Now and then appeared a\ngrand one, who was rumoured to be a Lee and therefore royal, and who\ncame and lived regally in a gaily painted caravan. During the late\nsummer weeks one began to see slouching figures tramping along the high\nroad at intervals. These were men who were old, men who were middle-aged\nand some who were young, all of them more or less dust-grimed,\nweather-beaten, or ragged. Occasionally one was to be seen in heavy\nbeery slumber under the hedgerow, or lying on the grass smoking lazily,\nor with painful thrift cobbling up a hole in a garment. Such as these\nwere drifting in early that they might be on the ground when pickers\nwere wanted. They were the forerunners of the regular army.\n\nOn his walk to West Ways, the farm Bolter lived on, Mount Dunstan passed\ntwo or three of these strays. They were the usual flotsam and jetsam,\nbut on the roadside near a hop garden he came upon a group of an aspect\nso unusual that it attracted his attention. Its unusualness consisted in\nits air of exceeding bustling cheerfulness. It was a domestic group of\nthe most luckless type, and ragged, dirty, and worn by an evidently long\ntramp, might well have been expected to look forlorn, discouraged, and\nout of spirits. A slouching father of five children, one plainly but\na few weeks old, and slung in a dirty shawl at its mother's breast, an\nunhealthy looking slattern mother, two ancient perambulators, one piled\nwith dingy bundles and cooking utensils, the seven-year-old eldest\ngirl unpacking things and keeping an eye at the same time on the two\nyoungest, who were neither of them old enough to be steady on their\nfeet, the six-year-old gleefully aiding the slouching father to build\nthe wayside fire. The mother sat upon the grass nursing her baby and\nstaring about her with an expression at once stupefied and illuminated\nby some temporary bliss. Even the slouching father was grinning, as if\ngood luck had befallen him, and the two youngest were tumbling about\nwith squeals of good cheer. This was not the humour in which such a\ngroup usually dropped wearily on the grass at the wayside to eat its\nmeagre and uninviting meal and rest its dragging limbs. As he drew near,\nMount Dunstan saw that at the woman's side there stood a basket full of\nfood and a can full of milk.\n\nOrdinarily he would have passed on, but, perhaps because of the human\nglow the morning had brought him, he stopped and spoke.\n\n\"Have you come for the hopping?\" he asked.\n\nThe man touched his forehead, apparently not conscious that the grin was\nyet on his face.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" he answered.\n\n\"How far have you walked?\"\n\n\"A good fifty miles since we started, sir. It took us a good bit. We was\npretty done up when we stopped here. But we've 'ad a wonderful piece of\ngood luck.\" And his grin broadened immensely.\n\n\"I am glad to hear that,\" said Mount Dunstan. The good luck was plainly\nof a nature to have excited them greatly. Chance good luck did not\nhappen to people like themselves. They were in the state of mind which\nin their class can only be relieved by talk. The woman broke in, her\nweak mouth and chin quite unsteady.\n\n\"Seems like it can't be true, sir,\" she said. \"I'd only just come out\nof the Union--after this one,\" signifying the new baby at her breast. \"I\nwasn't fit to drag along day after day. We 'ad to stop 'ere 'cos I was\nnear fainting away.\"\n\n\"She looked fair white when she sat down,\" put in the man. \"Like she was\ngoin' off.\"\n\n\"And that very minute,\" said the woman, \"a young lady came by on\n'orseback, an' the minute she sees me she stops her 'orse an' gets\ndown.\"\n\n\"I never seen nothing like the quick way she done it,\" said the husband.\n\"Sharp, like she was a soldier under order. Down an' give the bridle to\nthe groom an' comes over.\"\n\n\"And kneels down,\" the woman took him up, \"right by me an' says, 'What's\nthe matter? What can I do?' an' finds out in two minutes an' sends to\nthe farm for some brandy an' all this basketful of stuff,\" jerking her\nhead towards the treasure at her side. \"An' gives 'IM,\" with another\njerk towards her mate, \"money enough to 'elp us along till I'm fair\non my feet. That quick it was--that quick,\" passing her hand over\nher forehead, \"as if it wasn't for the basket,\" with a nervous,\nhalf-hysteric giggle, \"I wouldn't believe but what it was a dream--I\nwouldn't.\"\n\n\"She was a very kind young lady,\" said Mount Dunstan, \"and you were in\nluck.\"\n\nHe gave a few coppers to the children and strode on his way. The glow\nwas hot in his heart, and he held his head high.\n\n\"She has gone by,\" he said. \"She has gone by.\"\n\nHe knew he should find her at West Ways Farm, and he did so. Slim and\nstraight as a young birch tree, and elate with her ride in the morning\nair, she stood silhouetted in her black habit against the ancient\nwhitewashed brick porch as she talked to Bolter.\n\n\"I have been drinking a glass of milk and asking questions about hops,\"\nshe said, giving him her hand bare of glove. \"Until this year I have\nnever seen a hop garden or a hop picker.\"\n\nAfter the exchange of a few words Bolter respectfully melted away and\nleft them together.\n\n\"It was such a wonderful day that I wanted to be out under the sky for\na long time--to ride a long way,\" she explained. \"I have been looking at\nhop gardens as I rode. I have watched them all the summer--from the time\nwhen there was only a little thing with two or three pale green leaves\nlooking imploringly all the way up to the top of each immensely tall\nhop pole, from its place in the earth at the bottom of it--as if it was\nsaying over and over again, under its breath, 'Can I get up there? Can\nI get up? Can I do it in time? Can I do it in time?' Yes, that was\nwhat they were saying, the little bold things. I have watched them ever\nsince, putting out tendrils and taking hold of the poles and pulling and\nclimbing like little acrobats. And curling round and unfolding leaves\nand more leaves, until at last they threw them out as if they were\nbeginning to boast that they could climb up into the blue of the sky\nif the summer were long enough. And now, look at them!\" her hand waved\ntowards the great gardens. \"Forests of them, cool green pathways and\navenues with leaf canopies over them.\"\n\n\"You have seen it all,\" he said. \"You do see things, don't you? A few\nhundred yards down the road I passed something you had seen. I knew it\nwas you who had seen it, though the poor wretches had not heard your\nname.\"\n\nShe hesitated a moment, then stooped down and took up in her hand a bit\nof pebbled earth from the pathway. There was storm in the blue of\nher eyes as she held it out for him to look at as it lay on the bare\nrose-flesh of her palm.\n\n\"See,\" she said, \"see, it is like that--what we give. It is like that.\"\nAnd she tossed the earth away.\n\n\"It does not seem like that to those others.\"\n\n\"No, thank God, it does not. But to one's self it is the mere luxury of\nself-indulgence, and the realisation of it sometimes tempts one to\nbe even a trifle morbid. Don't you see,\" a sudden thrill in her voice\nstartled him, \"they are on the roadside everywhere all over the world.\"\n\n\"Yes. All over the world.\"\n\n\"Once when I was a child of ten I read a magazine article about the\nsuffering millions and the monstrously rich, who were obviously to blame\nfor every starved sob and cry. It almost drove me out of my childish\nsenses. I went to my father and threw myself into his arms in a violent\nfit of crying. I clung to him and sobbed out, 'Let us give it all away;\nlet us give it all away and be like other people!'\"\n\n\"What did he say?\"\n\n\"He said we could never be quite like other people. We had a certain\nload to carry along the highway. It was the thing the whole world wanted\nand which we ourselves wanted as much as the rest, and we could not\nsanely throw it away. It was my first lesson in political economy and\nI abhorred it. I was a passionate child and beat furiously against the\nstone walls enclosing present suffering. It was horrible to know that\nthey could not be torn down. I cried out, 'When I see anyone who is\nmiserable by the roadside I shall stop and give him everything he\nwants--everything!' I was ten years old, and thought it could be done.\"\n\n\"But you stop by the roadside even now.\"\n\n\"Yes. That one can do.\"\n\n\"You are two strong creatures and you draw each other,\" Penzance had\nsaid. \"Perhaps you drew each other across seas. Who knows?\"\n\nComing to West Ways on a chance errand he had, as it were, found\nher awaiting him on the threshold. On her part she had certainly not\nanticipated seeing him there, but--when one rides far afield in the\nsun there are roads towards which one turns as if answering a summoning\ncall, and as her horse had obeyed a certain touch of the rein at a\ncertain point her cheek had felt momentarily hot.\n\nUntil later, when the \"picking\" had fairly begun, the kilns would not be\nat work; but there was some interest even now in going over the ground\nfor the first time.\n\n\"I have never been inside an oast house,\" she said; \"Bolter is going to\nshow me his, and explain technicalities.\"\n\n\"May I come with you?\" he asked.\n\nThere was a change in him. Something had lighted in his eyes since the\nday before, when he had told her his story of Red Godwyn. She wondered\nwhat it was. They went together over the place, escorted by Bolter. They\nlooked into the great circular ovens, on whose floors the hops would be\nlaid for drying, they mounted ladder-like steps to the upper room where,\nwhen dried, the same hops would lie in soft, light piles, until pushed\nwith wooden shovels into the long \"pokes\" to be pressed and packed\ninto a solid marketable mass. Bolter was allowed to explain the\ntechnicalities, but it was plain that Mount Dunstan was familiar with\nall of them, and it was he who, with a sentence here and there, gave her\nthe colour of things.\n\n\"When it is being done there is nearly always outside a touch of the\nsharp sweetness of early autumn,\" he said \"The sun slanting through the\nlittle window falls on the pale yellow heaps, and there is a pungent\nscent of hops in the air which is rather intoxicating.\"\n\n\"I am coming later to see the entire process,\" she answered.\n\nIt was a mere matter of seeing common things together and exchanging\ncommon speech concerning them, but each was so strongly conscious of\nthe other that no sentence could seem wholly impersonal. There are\ntimes when the whole world is personal to a mood whose intensity seems a\nreason for all things. Words are of small moment when the mere sound of\na voice makes an unreasonable joy.\n\n\"There was that touch of sharp autumn sweetness in the air yesterday\nmorning,\" she said. \"And the chaplets of briony berries that look as if\nthey had been thrown over the hedges are beginning to change to scarlet\nhere and there. The wild rose-haws are reddening, and so are the\nclusters of berries on the thorn trees and bushes.\"\n\n\"There are millions of them,\" Mount Dunstan said, \"and in a few weeks'\ntime they will look like bunches of crimson coral. When the sun shines\non them they will be wonderful to see.\"\n\nWhat was there in such speeches as these to draw any two nearer and\nnearer to each other as they walked side by side--to fill the morning\nair with an intensity of life, to seem to cause the world to drop away\nand become as nothing? As they had been isolated during their waltz in\nthe crowded ballroom at Dunholm Castle, so they were isolated now. When\nthey stood in the narrow green groves of the hop garden, talking simply\nof the placing of the bins and the stripping and measuring of the vines,\nthere might have been no human thing within a hundred miles--within a\nthousand. For the first time his height and strength conveyed to her an\nimpression of physical beauty. His walk and bearing gave her pleasure.\nWhen he turned his red-brown eyes upon her suddenly she was conscious\nthat she liked their colour, their shape, the power of the look in them.\nOn his part, he--for the twentieth time--found himself newly moved by\nthe dower nature had bestowed on her. Had the world ever held before a\nwoman creature so much to be longed for?--abnormal wealth, New York and\nFifth Avenue notwithstanding, a man could only think of folding arms\nround her and whispering in her lovely ear--follies, oaths, prayers,\ngratitude.\n\nAnd yet as they went about together there was growing in Betty\nVanderpoel's mind a certain realisation. It grew in spite of the\nrecognition of the change in him--the new thing lighted in his eyes.\nWhatsoever he felt--if he felt anything--he would never allow himself\nspeech. How could he? In his place she could not speak herself. Because\nhe was the strong thing which drew her thoughts, he would not come to\nany woman only to cast at her feet a burden which, in the nature of\nthings, she must take up. And suddenly she comprehended that the mere\nobstinate Briton in him--even apart from greater things--had an immense\nattraction for her. As she liked now the red-brown colour of his\neyes and saw beauty in his rugged features, so she liked his British\nstubbornness and the pride which would not be beaten.\n\n\"It is the unconquerable thing, which leads them in their battles and\nmakes them bear any horror rather than give in. They have taken half the\nworld with it; they are like bulldogs and lions,\" she thought. \"And--and\nI am glorying in it.\"\n\n\"Do you know,\" said Mount Dunstan, \"that sometimes you suddenly fling\nout the most magnificent flag of colour--as if some splendid flame of\nthought had sent up a blaze?\"\n\n\"I hope it is not a habit,\" she answered. \"When one has a splendid flare\nof thought one should be modest about it.\"\n\nWhat was there worth recording in the whole hour they spent together?\nOutwardly there had only been a chance meeting and a mere passing by.\nBut each left something with the other and each learned something; and\nthe record made was deep.\n\nAt last she was on her horse again, on the road outside the white gate.\n\n\"This morning has been so much to the good,\" he said. \"I had thought\nthat perhaps we might scarcely meet again this year. I shall become\nabsorbed in hops and you will no doubt go away. You will make visits or\ngo to the Riviera--or to New York for the winter?\"\n\n\"I do not know yet. But at least I shall stay to watch the thorn trees\nload themselves with coral.\" To herself she was saying: \"He means to\nkeep away. I shall not see him.\"\n\nAs she rode off Mount Dunstan stood for a few moments, not moving from\nhis place. At a short distance from the farmhouse gate a side lane\nopened upon the highway, and as she cantered in its direction a horseman\nturned in from it--a man who was young and well dressed and who sat well\na spirited animal. He came out upon the road almost face to face with\nMiss Vanderpoel, and from where he stood Mount Dunstan could see his\ndelighted smile as he lifted his hat in salute. It was Lord Westholt,\nand what more natural than that after an exchange of greetings the two\nshould ride together on their way! For nearly three miles their homeward\nroad would be the same.\n\nBut in a breath's space Mount Dunstan realised a certain truth--a\nsimple, elemental thing. All the exaltation of the morning swooped and\nfell as a bird seems to swoop and fall through space. It was all\nover and done with, and he understood it. His normal awakening in the\nmorning, the physical and mental elation of the first clear hours, the\nspring of his foot as he had trod the road, had all had but one meaning.\nIn some occult way the hypnotic talk of the night before had formed\nitself into a reality, fantastic and unreasoning as it had been. Some\ninsistent inner consciousness had seized upon and believed it in spite\nof him and had set all his waking being in tune to it. That was the\nexplanation of his undue spirits and hope. If Penzance had spoken a\ntruth he would have had a natural, sane right to feel all this and more.\nBut the truth was that he, in his guise--was one of those who are \"on\nthe roadside everywhere--all over the world.\" Poetically figurative as\nthe thing sounded, it was prosaic fact.\n\nSo, still hearing the distant sounds of the hoofs beating in cheerful\ndiminuendo on the roadway, he turned about and went back to talk to\nBolter.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII\n\nCLOSED CORRIDORS\n\nTo spend one's days perforce in an enormous house alone is a thing\nlikely to play unholy tricks with a man's mind and lead it to gloomy\nworkings. To know the existence of a hundred or so of closed doors\nshut on the darkness of unoccupied rooms; to be conscious of flights\nof unmounted stairs, of stretches of untrodden corridors, of unending\nwalls, from which the pictured eyes of long dead men and women stare,\nas if seeing things which human eyes behold not--is an eerie and\nunwholesome thing. Mount Dunstan slept in a large four-post bed in a\nchamber in which he might have died or been murdered a score of times\nwithout being able to communicate with the remote servants' quarters\nbelow stairs, where lay the one man and one woman who attended him.\nWhen he came late to his room and prepared for sleep by the light of two\nflickering candles the silence of the dead in tombs was about him; but\nit was only a more profound and insistent thing than the silence of the\nday, because it was the silence of the night, which is a presence. He\nused to tell himself with secret smiles at the fact that at certain\ntimes the fantasy was half believable--that there were things which\nwalked about softly at night--things which did not want to be dead.\nHe himself had picked them out from among the pictures in the\ngallery--pretty, light, petulant women; adventurous-eyed, full-blooded,\neager men. His theory was that they hated their stone coffins, and\nfought their way back through the grey mists to try to talk and make\nlove and to be seen of warm things which were alive. But it was not to\nbe done, because they had no bodies and no voices, and when they beat\nupon closed doors they would not open. Still they came back--came\nback. And sometimes there was a rustle and a sweep through the air in a\npassage, or a creak, or a sense of waiting which was almost a sound.\n\n\"Perhaps some of them have gone when they have been as I am,\" he had\nsaid one black night, when he had sat in his room staring at the floor.\n\"If a man was dragged out when he had not LIVED a day, he would come\nback I should come back if--God! A man COULD not be dragged away--like\nTHIS!\"\n\nAnd to sit alone and think of it was an awful and a lonely thing--a\nlonely thing.\n\nBut loneliness was nothing new, only that in these months his had\nstrangely intensified itself. This, though he was not aware of it, was\nbecause the soul and body which were the completing parts of him were\nwithin reach--and without it. When he went down to breakfast he sat\nsingly at his table, round which twenty people might have laughed and\ntalked. Between the dining-room and the library he spent his days when\nhe was not out of doors. Since he could not afford servants, the many\nother rooms must be kept closed. It was a ghastly and melancholy thing\nto make, as he must sometimes, a sort of precautionary visit to the\nstate apartments. He was the last Mount Dunstan, and he would never see\nthem opened again for use, but so long as he lived under the roof he\nmight by prevision check, in a measure, the too rapid encroachments\nof decay. To have a leak stopped here, a nail driven or a support put\nthere, seemed decent things to do.\n\n\"Whom am I doing it for?\" he said to Mr. Penzance. \"I am doing it\nfor myself--because I cannot help it. The place seems to me like some\ngorgeous old warrior come to the end of his days. It has stood the war of\nthings for century after century--the war of things. It is going now I\nam all that is left to it. It is all I have. So I patch it up when I can\nafford it, with a crutch or a splint and a bandage.\"\n\nLate in the afternoon of the day on which Miss Vanderpoel rode away from\nWest Ways with Lord Westholt, a stealthy and darkly purple cloud rose,\nlifting its ominous bulk against a chrysoprase and pink horizon. It\nwas the kind of cloud which speaks of but one thing to those who watch\nclouds, or even casually consider them. So Lady Anstruthers felt some\nsurprise when she saw Sir Nigel mount his horse before the stone steps\nand ride away, as it were, into the very heart of the coming storm.\n\n\"Nigel will be caught in the rain,\" she said to her sister. \"I wonder\nwhy he goes out now. It would be better to wait until to-morrow.\"\n\nBut Sir Nigel did not think so. He had calculated matters with some\nnicety. He was not exactly on such terms with Mount Dunstan as would\nmake a casual call seem an entirely natural thing, and he wished to drop\nin upon him for a casual call and in an unpremeditated manner. He\nmeant to reach the Mount about the time the storm broke, under\nwhich circumstance nothing could bear more lightly an air of being\nunpremeditated than to take refuge in a chance passing.\n\nMount Dunstan was in the library. He had sat smoking his pipe while he\nwatched the purple cloud roll up and spread itself, blotting out the\nchrysoprase and pink and blue, and when the branches of the trees began\nto toss about he had looked on with pleasure as the rush of big rain\ndrops came down and pelted things. It was a fine storm, and there were\nsome imposing claps of thunder and jagged flashes of lightning. As one\nsplendid rattle shook the air he was surprised to hear a summons at the\ngreat hall door. Who on earth could be turning up at this time? His man\nReeve announced the arrival a few moments later, and it was Sir Nigel\nAnstruthers. He had, he explained, been riding through the village when\nthe deluge descended, and it had occurred to him to turn in at the\npark gates and ask a temporary shelter. Mount Dunstan received him with\nsufficient courtesy. His appearance was not a thing to rejoice over, but\nit could be endured. Whisky and soda and a smoke would serve to pass the\nhour, if the storm lasted so long.\n\nConversation was not the easiest thing in the world under the\ncircumstances, but Sir Nigel led the way steadily after he had taken his\nseat and accepted the hospitalities offered. What a place it was--this!\nHe had been struck for the hundredth time with the impressiveness of\nthe mass of it, the sweep of the park and the splendid grouping of the\ntimber, as he had ridden up the avenue. There was no other place like it\nin the county. Was there another like it in England?\n\n\"Not in its case, I hope,\" Mount Dunstan said.\n\nThere were a few seconds of silence. The rain poured down in splashing\nsheets and was swept in rattling gusts against the window panes.\n\n\"What the place needs is--an heiress,\" Anstruthers observed in the tone\nof a practical man. \"I believe I have heard that your views of things\nare such that she should preferably NOT be an American.\"\n\nMount Dunstan did not smile, though he slightly showed his teeth.\n\n\"When I am driven to the wall,\" he answered, \"I may not be fastidious as\nto nationality.\"\n\nNigel Anstruthers' manner was not a bad one. He chose that tone of\ncasual openness which, while it does not wholly commit itself, may be\nregarded as suggestive of the amiable half confidence of speeches made\nas \"man to man.\"\n\n\"My own opportunity of studying the genus American heiress within my own\ngates is a first-class one. I find that it knows what it wants and that\nits intention is to get it.\" A short laugh broke from him as he flicked\nthe ash from his cigar on to the small bronze receptacle at his elbow.\n\"It is not many years since it would have been difficult for a girl to\nbe frank enough to say, 'When I marry I shall ask something in exchange\nfor what I have to give.'\"\n\n\"There are not many who have as much to give,\" said Mount Dunstan\ncoolly.\n\n\"True,\" with a slight shrug. \"You are thinking that men are glad enough\nto take a girl like that--even one who has not a shape like Diana's and\neyes like the sea. Yes, by George,\" softly, and narrowing his lids, \"she\nIS a handsome creature.\"\n\nMount Dunstan did not attempt to refute the statement, and Anstruthers\nlaughed low again.\n\n\"It is an asset she knows the value of quite clearly. That is the\ninteresting part of it. She has inherited the far-seeing commercial\nmind. She does not object to admitting it. She educated herself in\ndelightful cold blood that she might be prepared for the largest prize\nappearing upon the horizon. She held things in view when she was a\nchild at school, and obviously attacked her French, German, and Italian\nconjugations with a twelve-year-old eye on the future.\"\n\nMount Dunstan leaning back carelessly in his chair, laughed--as it\nseemed--with him. Internally he was saying that the man was a liar who\nmight always be trusted to lie, but he knew with shamed fury that\nthe lies were doing something to his soul--rolling dark vapours over\nit--stinging him, dragging away props, and making him feel they had been\nfoolish things to lean on. This can always be done with a man in love\nwho has slight foundation for hope. For some mysterious and occult\nreason civilisation has elected to treat the strange and great passion\nas if it were an unholy and indecent thing, whose dominion over him\nproper social training prevents any man from admitting openly. In\npassing through its cruelest phases he must bear himself as if he were\nimmune, and this being the custom, he may be called upon to endure much\nwithout the relief of striking out with manly blows. An enemy guessing\nhis case and possessing the infernal gift whose joy is to dishearten and\ndo hurt with courteous despitefulness, may plant a poisoned arrow here\nand there with neatness and fine touch, while his bound victim can, with\ndecency, neither start, nor utter brave howls, nor guard himself, but\nmust sit still and listen, hospitably supplying smoke and drink and\nbeing careful not to make an ass of himself.\n\nTherefore Mount Dunstan pushed the cigars nearer to his visitor and\nwaved his hand hospitably towards the whisky and soda. There was no\nreason, in fact, why Anstruthers--or any one indeed, but Penzance,\nshould suspect that he had become somewhat mad in secret. The man's talk\nwas marked merely by the lightly disparaging malice which was rarely to\nbe missed from any speech of his which touched on others. Yet it might\nhave been a thing arranged beforehand, to suggest adroitly either lies\nor truth which would make a man see every sickeningly good reason for\nfeeling that in this contest he did not count for a man at all.\n\n\"It has all been pretty obvious,\" said Sir Nigel. \"There is a sort of\ncynicism in the openness of the siege. My impression is that almost\nevery youngster who has met her has taken a shot. Tommy Alanby\nscrambling up from his knees in one of the rose-gardens was a satisfying\nsight. His much-talked-of-passion for Jane Lithcom was temporarily in\nabeyance.\"\n\nThe rain swirled in a torrent against the window, and casually glancing\noutside at the tossing gardens he went on.\n\n\"She is enjoying herself. Why not? She has the spirit of the huntress.\nI don't think she talks nonsense about friendship to the captives of her\nbow and spear. She knows she can always get what she wants. A girl like\nthat MUST have an arrogance of mind. And she is not a young saint. She\nis one of the women born with THE LOOK in her eyes. I own I should not\nlike to be in the place of any primeval poor brute who really went mad\nover her--and counted her millions as so much dirt.\"\n\nMount Dunstan answered with a shrug of his big shoulders:\n\n\"Apparently he would seem as remote from the reason of to-day as the men\nwho lived on the land when Hengist and Horsa came--or when Caesar landed\nat Deal.\"\n\n\"He would seem as remote to her,\" with a shrug also. \"I should not like\nto contend that his point of view would not interest her or that she\nwould particularly discourage him. Her eyes would call him--without\nmalice or intention, no doubt, but your early Briton ceorl or earl would\nbe as well understood by her. Your New York beauty who has lived in the\nmarket place knows principally the prices of things.\"\n\nHe was not ill pleased with himself. He was putting it well and getting\nrather even with her. If this fellow with his shut mouth had a sore spot\nhidden anywhere he was giving him \"to think.\" And he would find himself\nthinking, while, whatsoever he thought, he would be obliged to continue\nto keep his ugly mouth shut. The great idea was to say things WITHOUT\nsaying them, to set your hearer's mind to saying them for you.\n\n\"What strikes one most is a sort of commercial brilliance in her,\"\ntaking up his thread again after a smilingly reflective pause. \"It quite\nexhilarates one by its novelty. There's spice in it. We English have not\na look-in when we are dealing with Americans, and yet France calls us\na nation of shopkeepers. My impression is that their women take little\ninventories of every house they enter, of every man they meet. I heard\nher once speaking to my wife about this place, as if she had lived in\nit. She spoke of the closed windows and the state of the gardens--of\nbroken fountains and fallen arches. She evidently deplored the\ndeterioration of things which represented capital. She has inventoried\nDunholm, no doubt. That will give Westholt a chance. But she will do\nnothing until after her next year's season in London--that I'd swear.\nI look forward to next year. It will be worth watching. She has been\ntraining my wife. A sister who has married an Englishman and has at\nleast spent some years of her life in England has a certain established\nair. When she is presented one knows she will be a sensation. After\nthat----\" he hesitated a moment, smiling not too pleasantly.\n\n\"After that,\" said Mount Dunstan, \"the Deluge.\"\n\n\"Exactly. The Deluge which usually sweeps girls off their feet--but it\nwill not sweep her off hers. She will stand quite firm in the flood and\nlose sight of nothing of importance which floats past.\"\n\nMount Dunstan took him up. He was sick of hearing the fellow's voice.\n\n\"There will be a good many things,\" he said; \"there will be great\npersonages and small ones, pomps and vanities, glittering things and\nheavy ones.\"\n\n\"When she sees what she wants,\" said Anstruthers, \"she will hold out\nher hand, knowing it will come to her. The things which drown will not\ndisturb her. I once made the blunder of suggesting that she might need\nprotection against the importunate--as if she had been an English girl.\nIt was an idiotic thing to do.\"\n\n\"Because?\" Mount Dunstan for the moment had lost his head. Anstruthers\nhad maddeningly paused.\n\n\"She answered that if it became necessary she might perhaps be able to\nprotect herself. She was as cool and frank as a boy. No air pince about\nit--merely consciousness of being able to put things in their right\nplaces. Made a mere male relative feel like a fool.\"\n\n\"When ARE things in their right places?\" To his credit be it spoken,\nMount Dunstan managed to say it as if in the mere putting together of\nidle words. What man likes to be reminded of his right place! No man\nwants to be put in his right place. There is always another place which\nseems more desirable.\n\n\"She knows--if we others do not. I suppose my right place is at\nStornham, conducting myself as the brother-in-law of a fair American\nshould. I suppose yours is here--shut up among your closed corridors and\nlocked doors. There must be a lot of them in a house like this. Don't\nyou sometimes feel it too large for you?\"\n\n\"Always,\" answered Mount Dunstan.\n\nThe fact that he added nothing else and met a rapid side glance with\nunmoving red-brown eyes gazing out from under rugged brows, perhaps\nirritated Anstruthers. He had been rather enjoying himself, but he had\nnot enjoyed himself enough. There was no denying that his plaything had\nnot openly flinched. Plainly he was not good at flinching. Anstruthers\nwondered how far a man might go. He tried again.\n\n\"She likes the place, though she has a natural disdain for its\ncondition. That is practical American. Things which are going to pieces\nbecause money is not spent upon them--mere money, of which all the\npeople who count for anything have so much--are inevitably rather\ndisdained. They are 'out of it.' But she likes the estate.\" As he\nwatched Mount Dunstan he felt sure he had got it at last--the right\nthing. \"If you were a duke with fifty thousand a year,\" with a\ndistinctly nasty, amicably humorous, faint laugh, \"she would--by the\nLord, I believe, she would take it over--and you with it.\"\n\nMount Dunstan got up. In his rough walking tweeds he looked\nover-big--and heavy--and perilous. For two seconds Nigel Anstruthers\nwould not have been surprised if he had without warning slapped his\nface, or knocked him over, or whirled him out of his chair and kicked\nhim. He would not have liked it, but--for two seconds--it would have\nbeen no surprise. In fact, he instinctively braced his not too\nfirm muscles. But nothing of the sort occurred. During the two\nseconds--perhaps three--Mount Dunstan stood still and looked down at\nhim. The brief space at an end, he walked over to the hearth and stood\nwith his back to the big fireplace.\n\n\"You don't like her,\" he said, and his manner was that of a man dealing\nwith a matter of fact. \"Why do you talk about her?\"\n\nHe had got away again--quite away.\n\nAn ugly flush shot over Anstruthers' face. There was one more thing\nto say--whether it was idiotic to say it or not. Things can always be\ndenied afterwards, should denial appear necessary--and for the moment\nhis special devil possessed him.\n\n\"I do not like her!\" And his mouth twisted. \"Do I not? I am not an old\nwoman. I am a man--like others. I chance to like her--too much.\"\n\nThere was a short silence. Mount Dunstan broke it.\n\n\"Then,\" he remarked, \"you had better emigrate to some country with\na climate which suits you. I should say that England--for the\npresent--does not.\"\n\n\"I shall stay where I am,\" answered Anstruthers, with a slight\nhoarseness of voice, which made it necessary for him to clear his\nthroat. \"I shall stay where she is. I will have that satisfaction,\nat least. She does not mind. I am only a racketty, middle-aged\nbrother-in-law, and she can take care of herself. As I told you, she has\nthe spirit of the huntress.\"\n\n\"Look here,\" said Mount Dunstan, quite without haste, and with an iron\ncivility. \"I am going to take the liberty of suggesting something. If\nthis thing is true, it would be as well not to talk about it.\"\n\n\"As well for me--or for her?\" and there was a serene significance in the\nquery.\n\nMount Dunstan thought a few seconds.\n\n\"I confess,\" he said slowly, and he planted his fine blow between\nthe eyes well and with directness. \"I confess that it would not have\noccurred to me to ask you to do anything or refrain from doing it for\nher sake.\"\n\n\"Thank you. Perhaps you are right. One learns that one must protect\none's self. I shall not talk--neither will you. I know that. I was a\nfool to let it out. The storm is over. I must ride home.\" He rose from\nhis seat and stood smiling. \"It would smash up things nicely if the new\nbeauty's appearance in the great world were preceded by chatter of the\nunseemly affection of some adorer of ill repute. Unfairly enough it is\nalways the woman who is hurt.\"\n\n\"Unless,\" said Mount Dunstan civilly, \"there should arise the poor,\nprimeval brute, in his neolithic wrath, to seize on the man to blame,\nand break every bone and sinew in his damned body.\"\n\n\"The newspapers would enjoy that more than she would,\" answered\nSir Nigel. \"She does not like the newspapers. They are too ready\nto disparage the multi-millionaire, and cackle about members of his\nfamily.\"\n\nThe unhidden hatred which still professed to hide itself in the depths\nof their pupils, as they regarded each other, had its birth in a passion\nas elemental as the quakings of the earth, or the rage of two lions in\na desert, lashing their flanks in the blazing sun. It was well that at\nthis moment they should part ways.\n\nSir Nigel's horse being brought, he went on the way which was his.\n\n\"It was a mistake to say what I did,\" he said before going. \"I ought to\nhave held my tongue. But I am under the same roof with her. At any rate,\nthat is a privilege no other man shares with me.\"\n\nHe rode off smartly, his horse's hoofs splashing in the rain pools left\nin the avenue after the storm. He was not so sure after all that he\nhad made a mistake, and for the moment he was not in the mood to care\nwhether he had made one or not. His agreeable smile showed itself as he\nthought of the obstinate, proud brute he had left behind, sitting alone\namong his shut doors and closed corridors. They had not shaken hands\neither at meeting or parting. Queer thing it was--the kind of enmity a\nman could feel for another when he was upset by a woman. It was amusing\nenough that it should be she who was upsetting him after all these\nyears--impudent little Betty, with the ferocious manner.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\n\nAT SHANDY'S\n\nOn a late-summer evening in New York the atmosphere surrounding a\ncertain corner table at Shandy's cheap restaurant in Fourteenth Street\nwas stirred by a sense of excitement.\n\nThe corner table in question was the favourite meeting place of a group\nof young men of the G. Selden type, who usually took possession of it at\ndinner time--having decided that Shandy's supplied more decent food\nfor fifty cents, or even for twenty-five, than was to be found at other\nplaces of its order. Shandy's was \"about all right,\" they said to each\nother, and patronised it accordingly, three or four of them generally\ndining together, with a friendly and adroit manipulation of \"portions\"\nand \"half portions\" which enabled them to add variety to their bill of\nfare.\n\nThe street outside was lighted, the tide of passers-by was less full and\nmore leisurely in its movements than it was during the seething, working\nhours of daylight, but the electric cars swung past each other with\nwhiz and clang of bell almost unceasingly, their sound being swelled, at\nshort intervals, by the roar and rumbling rattle of the trains dashing\nby on the elevated railroad. This, however, to the frequenters of\nShandy's, was the usual accompaniment of every-day New York life and was\nregarded as a rather cheerful sort of thing.\n\nThis evening the four claimants of the favourite corner table had met\ntogether earlier than usual. Jem Belter, who \"hammered\" a typewriter at\nSchwab's Brewery, Tom Wetherbee, who was \"in a downtown office,\" Bert\nJohnson, who was \"out for the Delkoff,\" and Nick Baumgarten, who having\nfor some time \"beaten\" certain streets as assistant salesman for the\nsame illustrious machine, had been recently elevated to a \"territory\" of\nhis own, and was therefore in high spirits.\n\n\"Say!\" he said. \"Let's give him a fine dinner. We can make it between\nus. Beefsteak and mushrooms, and potatoes hashed brown. He likes them.\nGood old G. S. I shall be right glad to see him. Hope foreign travel has\nnot given him the swell head.\"\n\n\"Don't believe it's hurt him a bit. His letter didn't sound like it.\nLittle Georgie ain't a fool,\" said Jem Belter.\n\nTom Wetherbee was looking over the letter referred to. It had been\nwritten to the four conjointly, towards the termination of Selden's\nvisit to Mr. Penzance. The young man was not an ardent or fluent\ncorrespondent; but Tom Wetherbee was chuckling as he read the epistle.\n\n\"Say, boys,\" he said, \"this big thing he's keeping back to tell us when\nhe sees us is all right, but what takes me is old George paying a visit\nto a parson. He ain't no Young Men's Christian Association.\"\n\n\nBert Johnson leaned forward, and looked at the address on the letter\npaper.\n\n\"Mount Dunstan Vicarage,\" he read aloud. \"That looks pretty swell,\ndoesn't it?\" with a laugh. \"Say, fellows, you know Jepson at the office,\nthe chap that prides himself on reading such a lot? He said it reminded\nhim of the names of places in English novels. That Johnny's the biggest\nsnob you ever set your tooth into. When I told him about the lord fellow\nthat owns the castle, and that George seemed to have seen him, he nearly\nfell over himself. Never had any use for George before, but just you\nwatch him make up to him when he sees him next.\"\n\nPeople were dropping in and taking seats at the tables. They were all of\none class. Young men who lived in hall bedrooms. Young women who worked\nin shops or offices, a couple here and there, who, living far uptown,\nhad come to Shandy's to dinner, that they might go to cheap seats in\nsome theatre afterwards. In the latter case, the girls wore their best\nhats, had bright eyes, and cheeks lightly flushed by their sense of\nfestivity. Two or three were very pretty in their thin summer dresses\nand flowered or feathered head gear, tilted at picturesque angles over\ntheir thick hair. When each one entered the eyes of the young men at the\ncorner table followed her with curiosity and interest, but the glances\nat her escort were always of a disparaging nature.\n\n\"There's a beaut!\" said Nick Baumgarten. \"Get onto that pink stuff\non her hat, will you. She done it because it's just the colour of her\ncheeks.\"\n\nThey all looked, and the girl was aware of it, and began to laugh and\ntalk coquettishly to the young man who was her companion.\n\n\"I wonder where she got Clarence?\" said Jem Belter in sarcastic allusion\nto her escort. \"The things those lookers have fastened on to them gets\nME.\"\n\n\"If it was one of US, now,\" said Bert Johnson. Upon which they broke\ninto simultaneous good-natured laughter.\n\n\"It's queer, isn't it,\" young Baumgarten put in, \"how a fellow always\nfeels sore when he sees another fellow with a peach like that? It's just\nstraight human nature, I guess.\"\n\nThe door swung open to admit a newcomer, at the sight of whom Jem Belter\nexclaimed joyously: \"Good old Georgie! Here he is, fellows! Get on to\nhis glad rags.\"\n\n\"Glad rags\" is supposed to buoyantly describe such attire as, by its\nfreshness or elegance of style, is rendered a suitable adornment for\nfestive occasions or loftier leisure moments. \"Glad rags\" may mean\nevening dress, when a young gentleman's wardrobe can aspire to splendour\nso marked, but it also applies to one's best and latest-purchased garb,\nin contradistinction to the less ornamental habiliments worn every day,\nand designated as \"office clothes.\"\n\nG. Selden's economies had not enabled him to give himself into the hands\nof a Bond Street tailor, but a careful study of cut and material, as\nspread before the eye in elegant coloured illustrations in the windows\nof respectable shops in less ambitious quarters, had resulted in the\npurchase of a well-made suit of smart English cut. He had a nice young\nfigure, and looked extremely neat and tremendously new and clean, so\nmuch so, indeed, that several persons glanced at him a little admiringly\nas he was met half way to the corner table by his friends.\n\n\"Hello, old chap! Glad to see you. What sort of a voyage? How did you\nleave the royal family? Glad to get back?\"\n\nThey all greeted him at once, shaking hands and slapping him on the\nback, as they hustled him gleefully back to the corner table and made\nhim sit down.\n\n\"Say, garsong,\" said Nick Baumgarten to their favourite waiter, who came\nat once in answer to his summons, \"let's have a porterhouse steak, half\nthe size of this table, and with plenty of mushrooms and potatoes hashed\nbrown. Here's Mr. Selden just returned from visiting at Windsor Castle,\nand if we don't treat him well, he'll look down on us.\"\n\nG. Selden grinned. \"How have you been getting on, Sam?\" he said, nodding\ncheerfully to the man. They were old and tried friends. Sam knew all\nabout the days when a fellow could not come into Shandy's at all, or\nmust satisfy his strong young hunger with a bowl of soup, or coffee and\na roll. Sam did his best for them in the matter of the size of portions,\nand they did their good-natured utmost for him in the affair of the\npooled tip.\n\n\"Been getting on as well as can be expected,\" Sam grinned back. \"Hope\nyou had a fine time, Mr. Selden?\"\n\n\"Fine! I should smile! Fine wasn't in it,\" answered Selden. \"But I'm\nlooking forward to a Shandy porterhouse steak, all the same.\"\n\n\"Did they give you a better one in the Strawnd?\" asked Baumgarten, in\nwhat he believed to be a correct Cockney accent.\n\n\"You bet they didn't,\" said Selden. \"Shandy's takes a lot of beating.\"\nThat last is English.\n\nThe people at the other tables cast involuntary glances at them. Their\neager, hearty young pleasure in the festivity of the occasion was a\nhealthy thing to see. As they sat round the corner table, they produced\nthe effect of gathering close about G. Selden. They concentrated their\ncombined attention upon him, Belter and Johnson leaning forward on their\nfolded arms, to watch him as he talked.\n\n\"Billy Page came back in August, looking pretty bum,\" Nick Baumgarten\nbegan. \"He'd been painting gay Paree brick red, and he'd spent more\nmoney than he'd meant to, and that wasn't half enough. Landed dead\nbroke. He said he'd had a great time, but he'd come home with rather a\ndark brown taste in his mouth, that he'd like to get rid of.\"\n\n\"He thought you were a fool to go off cycling into the country,\" put in\nWetherbee, \"but I told him I guessed that was where he was 'way off. I\nbelieved you'd had the best time of the two of you.\"\n\n\"Boys,\" said Selden, \"I had the time of my life.\" He said it almost\nsolemnly, and laid his hand on the table. \"It was like one of those\nyarns Bert tells us. Half the time I didn't believe it, and half the\ntime I was ashamed of myself to think it was all happening to me and\nnone of your fellows were in it.\"\n\n\"Oh, well,\" said Jem Belter, \"luck chases some fellows, anyhow. Look at\nNick, there.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Selden summed the whole thing up, \"I just FELL into it where\nit was so deep that I had to strike out all I knew how to keep from\ndrowning.\"\n\n\"Tell us the whole thing,\" Nick Baumgarten put in; \"from beginning to\nend. Your letter didn't give anything away.\"\n\n\"A letter would have spoiled it. I can't write letters anyhow. I wanted\nto wait till I got right here with you fellows round where I could\nanswer questions. First off,\" with the deliberation befitting such an\nopening, \"I've sold machines enough to pay my expenses, and leave some\nover.\"\n\n\"You have? Gee whiz! Say, give us your prescription. Glad I know you,\nGeorgy!\"\n\n\"And who do you suppose bought the first three?\" At this point, it\nwas he who leaned forward upon the table--his climax being a thing to\nconcentrate upon. \"Reuben S. Vanderpoel's daughter--Miss Bettina! And,\nboys, she gave me a letter to Reuben S., himself, and here it is.\"\n\nHe produced a flat leather pocketbook and took an envelope from an inner\nflap, laying it before them on the tablecloth. His knowledge that they\nwould not have believed him if he had not brought his proof was founded\non everyday facts. They would not have doubted his veracity, but\nthe possibility of such delirious good fortune. What they would have\nbelieved would have been that he was playing a hilarious joke on\nthem. Jokes of this kind, but not of this proportion, were common\nentertainments.\n\nTheir first impulse had been towards an outburst of laughter, but even\nbefore he produced his letter a certain truthful seriousness in his look\nhad startled them. When he laid the envelope down each man caught his\nbreath. It could not be denied that Jem Belter turned pale with emotion.\nJem had never been one of the lucky ones.\n\n\"She let me read it,\" said G. Selden, taking the letter from its\nenvelope with great care. \"And I said to her: 'Miss Vanderpoel, would\nyou let me just show that to the boys the first night I go to Shandy's?'\nI knew she'd tell me if it wasn't all right to do it. She'd know I'd\nwant to be told. And she just laughed and said: 'I don't mind at all. I\nlike \"the boys.\" Here is a message to them. \"Good luck to you all.\"'\"\n\n\"She said that?\" from Nick Baumgarten.\n\n\"Yes, she did, and she meant it. Look at this.\"\n\nThis was the letter. It was quite short, and written in a clear,\ndefinite hand.\n\n\n\"DEAR FATHER: This will be brought to you by Mr. G. Selden, of whom I\nhave written to you. Please be good to him.\n\n\"Affectionately,\n\n\"BETTY.\"\n\n\nEach young man read it in turn. None of them said anything just at\nfirst. A kind of awe had descended upon them--not in the least awe of\nVanderpoel, who, with other multi-millionaires, were served up each week\nwith cheerful neighbourly comment or equally neighbourly disrespect, in\nhuge Sunday papers read throughout the land--but awe of the unearthly\nluck which had fallen without warning to good old G. S., who lived like\nthe rest of them in a hall bedroom on ten per, earned by tramping the\nstreets for the Delkoff.\n\n\"That girl,\" said G. Selden gravely, \"that girl is a winner from\nWinnersville. I take off my hat to her. If it's the scheme that some\npeople's got to have millions, and others have got to sell Delkoffs,\nthat girl's one of those that's entitled to the millions. It's all right\nshe should have 'em. There's no kick coming from me.\"\n\nNick Baumgarten was the first to resume wholly normal condition of mind.\n\n\"Well, I guess after you've told us about her there'll be no kick\ncoming from any of us. Of course there's something about you that royal\nfamilies cry for, and they won't be happy till they get. All of us boys\nknows that. But what we want to find out is how you worked it so that\nthey saw the kind of pearl-studded hairpin you were.\"\n\n\"Worked it!\" Selden answered. \"I didn't work it. I've got a good bit of\nnerve, but I never should have had enough to invent what happened--just\nHAPPENED. I broke my leg falling off my bike, and fell right into\na whole bunch of them--earls and countesses and viscounts and\nVanderpoels. And it was Miss Vanderpoel who saw me first lying on the\nground. And I was in Stornham Court where Lady Anstruthers lives--and\nshe used to be Miss Rosalie Vanderpoel.\"\n\n\"Boys,\" said Bert Johnson, with friendly disgust, \"he's been up to his\nneck in 'em.\"\n\n\"Cheer up. The worst is yet to come,\" chaffed Tom Wetherbee.\n\nNever had such a dinner taken place at the corner table, or, in fact,\nat any other table at Shandy's. Sam brought beefsteaks, which were\nprincely, mushrooms, and hashed brown potatoes in portions whose\ngenerosity reached the heart. Sam was on good terms with Shandy's\ncarver, and had worked upon his nobler feelings. Steins of lager beer\nwere ventured upon. There was hearty satisfying of fine hungers. Two of\nthe party had eaten nothing but one \"Quick Lunch\" throughout the day,\none of them because he was short of time, the other for economy's\nsake, because he was short of money. The meal was a splendid thing. The\ntelling of the story could not be wholly checked by the eating of food.\nIt advanced between mouthfuls, questions being asked and details given\nin answers. Shandy's became more crowded, as the hour advanced. People\nall over the room cast interested looks at the party at the corner\ntable, enjoying itself so hugely. Groups sitting at the tables nearest\nto it found themselves excited by the things they heard.\n\n\"That young fellow in the new suit has just come back from Europe,\" said\na man to his wife and daughter. \"He seems to have had a good time.\"\n\n\"Papa,\" the daughter leaned forward, and spoke in a low voice, \"I heard\nhim say 'Lord Mount Dunstan said Lady Anstruthers and Miss Vanderpoel\nwere at the garden party.' Who do you suppose he is?\"\n\n\"Well, he's a nice young fellow, and he has English clothes on, but he\ndoesn't look like one of the Four Hundred. Will you have pie or vanilla\nice cream, Bessy?\"\n\nBessy--who chose vanilla ice cream--lost all knowledge of its flavour\nin her absorption in the conversation at the next table, which she could\nnot have avoided hearing, even if she had wished.\n\n\"She bent over the bed and laughed--just like any other nice girl--and\nshe said, 'You are at Stornham Court, which belongs to Sir Nigel\nAnstruthers. Lady Anstruthers is my sister. I am Miss Vanderpoel.' And,\nboys, she used to come and talk to me every day.\"\n\n\"George,\" said Nick Baumgarten, \"you take about seventy-five bottles of\nWarner's Safe Cure, and rub yourself all over with St. Jacob's Oil. Luck\nlike that ain't HEALTHY!\"\n\n. . . . .\n\nMr. Vanderpoel, sitting in his study, wore the interestedly grave look\nof a man thinking of absorbing things. He had just given orders that a\nyoung man who would call in the course of the evening should be brought\nto him at once, and he was incidentally considering this young man, as\nhe reflected upon matters recalled to his mind by his impending\narrival. They were matters he had thought of with gradually increasing\nseriousness for some months, and they had, at first, been the result of\nthe letters from Stornham, which each \"steamer day\" brought. They had\nbeen of immense interest to him--these letters. He would have found them\nabsorbing as a study, even if he had not deeply loved Betty. He read in\nthem things she did not state in words, and they set him thinking.\n\nHe was not suspected by men like himself of concealing an imagination\nbeneath the trained steadiness of his exterior, but he possessed more\nthan the world knew, and it singularly combined itself with powers of\nlogical deduction.\n\nIf he had been with his daughter, he would have seen, day by day, where\nher thoughts were leading her, and in what direction she was developing,\nbut, at a distance of three thousand miles, he found himself asking\nquestions, and endeavouring to reach conclusions. His affection for\nBetty was the central emotion of his existence. He had never told\nhimself that he had outgrown the kind and pretty creature he had married\nin his early youth, and certainly his tender care for her and pleasure\nin her simple goodness had never wavered, but Betty had given him a\ncompanionship which had counted greatly in the sum of his happiness.\nBecause imagination was not suspected in him, no one knew what she stood\nfor in his life. He had no son; he stood at the head of a great\nhouse, so to speak--the American parallel of what a great house is in\nnon-republican countries. The power of it counted for great things, not\nin America alone, but throughout the world. As international intimacies\nincreased, the influence of such houses might end in aiding in the\nmaking of history. Enormous constantly increasing wealth and huge\nfinancial schemes could not confine their influence, but must reach far.\nThe man whose hand held the lever controlling them was doing well when\nhe thought of them gravely. Such a man had to do with more than his own\nmere life and living. This man had confronted many problems as the years\nhad passed. He had seen men like himself die, leaving behind them the\nforce they had controlled, and he had seen this force--controlled no\nlonger--let loose upon the world, sometimes a power of evil, sometimes\nscattering itself aimlessly into nothingness and folly, which wrought\nharm. He was not an ambitious man, but--perhaps because he was not\nonly a man of thought, but a Vanderpoel of the blood of the first\nReuben--these were things he did not contemplate without restlessness.\nWhen Rosy had gone away and seemed lost to them, he had been glad when\nhe had seen Betty growing, day by day, into a strong thing. Feminine\nthough she was, she sometimes suggested to him the son who might have\nbeen his, but was not. As the closeness of their companionship increased\nwith her years, his admiration for her grew with his love. Power left in\nher hands must work for the advancement of things, and would not be idly\ndisseminated--if no antagonistic influence wrought against her. He had\nfound himself reflecting that, after all was said, the marriage of such\na girl had a sort of parallel in that of some young royal creature,\nwhose union might make or mar things, which must be considered. The man\nwho must inevitably strongly colour her whole being, and vitally mark\nher life, would, in a sense, lay his hand upon the lever also. If he\nbrought sorrow and disorder with him, the lever would not move steadily.\nFortunes such as his grow rapidly, and he was a richer man by millions\nthan he had been when Rosalie had married Nigel Anstruthers. The memory\nof that marriage had been a painful thing to him, even before he\nhad known the whole truth of its results. The man had been a common\nadventurer and scoundrel, despite the facts of good birth and the air of\ndecent breeding. If a man who was as much a scoundrel, but cleverer--it\nwould be necessary that he should be much cleverer--made the best of\nhimself to Betty----! It was folly to think one could guess what a\nwoman--or a man, either, for that matter--would love. He knew Betty, but\nno man knows the thing which comes, as it were, in the dark and claims\nits own--whether for good or evil. He had lived long enough to see\nbeautiful, strong-spirited creatures do strange things, follow strange\ngods, swept away into seas of pain by strange waves.\n\n\"Even Betty,\" he had said to himself, now and then. \"Even my Betty. Good\nGod--who knows!\"\n\nBecause of this, he had read each letter with keen eyes. They were long\nletters, full of detail and colour, because she knew he enjoyed them.\nShe had a delightful touch. He sometimes felt as if they walked the\nEnglish lanes together. His intimacy with her neighbours, and her\nneighbourhood, was one of his relaxations. He found himself thinking of\nold Doby and Mrs. Welden, as a sort of soporific measure, when he lay\nawake at night. She had sent photographs of Stornham, of Dunholm Castle,\nand of Dole, and had even found an old engraving of Lady Alanby in her\nyouth. Her evident liking for the Dunholms had pleased him. They were\npeople whose dignity and admirableness were part of general knowledge.\nLord Westholt was plainly a young man of many attractions. If the two\nwere drawn to each other--and what more natural--all would be well.\nHe wondered if it would be Westholt. But his love quickened a sagacity\nwhich needed no stimulus. He said to himself in time that, though she\nliked and admired Westholt, she went no farther. That others paid court\nto her he could guess without being told. He had seen the effect she had\nproduced when she had been at home, and also an unexpected letter to his\nwife from Milly Bowen had revealed many things. Milly, having noted Mrs.\nVanderpoel's eager anxiety to hear direct news of Lady Anstruthers, was\nnot the person to let fall from her hand a useful thread of connection.\nShe had written quite at length, managing adroitly to convey all that\nshe had seen, and all that she had heard. She had been making a visit\nwithin driving distance of Stornham, and had had the pleasure of meeting\nboth Lady Anstruthers and Miss Vanderpoel at various parties. She was so\nsure that Mrs. Vanderpoel would like to hear how well Lady Anstruthers\nwas looking, that she ventured to write. Betty's effect upon the county\nwas made quite clear, as also was the interested expectation of her\nappearance in town next season. Mr. Vanderpoel, perhaps, gathered more\nfrom the letter than his wife did. In her mind, relieved happiness and\nconsternation were mingled.\n\n\"Do you think, Reuben, that Betty will marry that Lord Westholt?\" she\nrather faltered. \"He seems very nice, but I would rather she married an\nAmerican. I should feel as if I had no girls at all, if they both lived\nin England.\"\n\n\"Lady Bowen gives him a good character,\" her husband said, smiling. \"But\nif anything untoward happens, Annie, you shall have a house of your own\nhalf way between Dunholm Castle and Stornham Court.\"\n\nWhen he had begun to decide that Lord Westholt did not seem to be the\nman Fate was veering towards, he not unnaturally cast a mental eye over\nsuch other persons as the letters mentioned. At exactly what period his\nthought first dwelt a shade anxiously on Mount Dunstan he could not have\ntold, but he at length became conscious that it so dwelt. He had begun\nby feeling an interest in his story, and had asked questions about him,\nbecause a situation such as his suggested query to a man of affairs.\nThus, it had been natural that the letters should speak of him. What she\nhad written had recalled to him certain rumours of the disgraceful\nold scandal. Yes, they had been a bad lot. He arranged to put a\ncasual-sounding question or so to certain persons who knew English\nsociety well. What he gathered was not encouraging. The present\nLord Mount Dunstan was considered rather a surly brute, and lived a\nmysterious sort of life which might cover many things. It was bad blood,\nand people were naturally shy of it. Of course, the man was a pauper,\nand his place a barrack falling to ruin. There had been something rather\nshady in his going to America or Australia a few years ago.\n\nGood looking? Well, so few people had seen him. The lady, who was\nspeaking, had heard that he was one of those big, rather lumpy men, and\nhad an ill-tempered expression. She always gave a wide berth to a man\nwho looked nasty-tempered. One or two other persons who had spoken of\nhim had conveyed to Mr. Vanderpoel about the same amount of vaguely\nunpromising information. The episode of G. Selden had been interesting\nenough, with its suggestions of picturesque contrasts and combinations.\nBetty's touch had made the junior salesman attracting. It was a good\ntype this, of a young fellow who, battling with the discouragements of\na hard life, still did not lose his amazing good cheer and patience, and\nfound healthy sleep and honest waking, even in the hall bedroom. He had\nconsented to Betty's request that he would see him, partly because he\nwas inclined to like what he had heard, and partly for a reason which\nBetty did not suspect. By extraordinary chance G. Selden had seen Mount\nDunstan and his surroundings at close range. Mr. Vanderpoel had liked\nwhat he had gathered of Mount Dunstan's attitude towards a personality\nso singularly exotic to himself. Crude, uneducated, and slangy, the\njunior salesman was not in any degree a fool. To an American father with\na daughter like Betty, the summing-up of a normal, nice-natured, common\nyoung denizen of the United States, fresh from contact with the\neffete, might be subtly instructive, and well worth hearing, if it was\nunconsciously expressed. Mr. Vanderpoel thought he knew how, after\nhe had overcome his visitor's first awkwardness--if he chanced to be\nself-conscious--he could lead him to talk. What he hoped to do was to\nmake him forget himself and begin to talk to him as he had talked to\nBetty, to ingenuously reveal impressions and points of view. Young men\nof his clean, rudimentary type were very definite about the things they\nliked and disliked, and could be trusted to reveal admiration, or lack\nof it, without absolute intention or actual statement. Being elemental\nand undismayed, they saw things cleared of the mists of social prejudice\nand modification. Yes, he felt he should be glad to hear of Lord Mount\nDunstan and the Mount Dunstan estate from G. Selden in a happy moment of\nunawareness.\n\nWhy was it that it happened to be Mount Dunstan he was desirous to hear\nof? Well, the absolute reason for that he could not have explained,\neither. He had asked himself questions on the subject more than once.\nThere was no well-founded reason, perhaps. If Betty's letters had spoken\nof Mount Dunstan and his home, they had also described Lord Westholt\nand Dunholm Castle. Of these two men she had certainly spoken more fully\nthan of others. Of Mount Dunstan she had had more to relate through the\nincident of G. Selden. He smiled as he realised the importance of the\nfigure of G. Selden. It was Selden and his broken leg the two men had\nridden over from Mount Dunstan to visit. But for Selden, Betty might not\nhave met Mount Dunstan again. He was reason enough for all she had said.\nAnd yet----! Perhaps, between Betty and himself there existed the thing\nwhich impresses and communicates without words. Perhaps, because\ntheir affection was unusual, they realised each other's emotions. The\nhalf-defined anxiety he felt now was not a new thing, but he confessed\nto himself that it had been spurred a little by the letter the last\nsteamer had brought him. It was NOT Lord Westholt, it definitely\nappeared. He had asked her to be his wife, and she had declined his\nproposal.\n\n\"I could not have LIKED a man any more without being in love with him,\"\nshe wrote. \"I LIKE him more than I can say--so much, indeed, that I\nfeel a little depressed by my certainty that I do not love him.\"\n\nIf she had loved him, the whole matter would have been simplified. If\nthe other man had drawn her, the thing would not be simple. Her father\nforesaw all the complications--and he did not want complications for\nBetty. Yet emotions were perverse and irresistible things, and the\nstronger the creature swayed by them, the more enormous their power.\nBut, as he sat in his easy chair and thought over it all, the\none feeling predominant in his mind was that nothing mattered but\nBetty--nothing really mattered but Betty.\n\nIn the meantime G. Selden was walking up Fifth Avenue, at once touched\nand exhilarated by the stir about him and his sense of home-coming. It\nwas pretty good to be in little old New York again. The hurried pace of\nthe life about him stimulated his young blood. There were no street cars\nin Fifth Avenue, but there were carriages, waggons, carts, motors, all\npantingly hurried, and fretting and struggling when the crowded state\nof the thoroughfare held them back. The beautifully dressed women in\nthe carriages wore no light air of being at leisure. It was evident that\nthey were going to keep engagements, to do things, to achieve objects.\n\n\"Something doing. Something doing,\" was his cheerful self-congratulatory\nthought. He had spent his life in the midst of it, he liked it, and it\nwelcomed him back.\n\nThe appointment he was on his way to keep thrilled him into an uplifted\nmood. Once or twice a half-nervous chuckle broke from him as he tried to\nrealise that he had been given the chance which a year ago had seemed\nso impossible that its mere incredibleness had made it a natural subject\nfor jokes. He was going to call on Reuben S. Vanderpoel, and he was\ngoing because Reuben S. had made an appointment with him.\n\nHe wore his London suit of clothes and he felt that he looked pretty\ndecent. He could only do his best in the matter of bearing. He always\nthought that, so long as a fellow didn't get \"chesty\" and kept his head\nfrom swelling, he was all right. Of course he had never been in one of\nthese swell Fifth Avenue houses, and he felt a bit nervous--but Miss\nVanderpoel would have told her father what sort of fellow he was, and\nher father was likely to be something like herself. The house, which had\nbeen built since Lady Anstruthers' marriage, was well \"up-town,\" and was\nbig and imposing. When a manservant opened the front door, the square\nhall looked very splendid to Selden. It was full of light, and of rich\nfurniture, which was like the stuff he had seen in one or two special\nshop windows in Fifth Avenue--places where they sold magnificent\ngilded or carven coffers and vases, pieces of tapestry and marvellous\nembroideries, antiquities from foreign palaces. Though it was quite\ndifferent, it was as swell in its way as the house at Mount Dunstan,\nand there were gleams of pictures on the walls that looked fine, and no\nmistake.\n\nHe was expected. The man led him across the hall to Mr. Vanderpoel's\nroom. After he had announced his name he closed the door quietly and\nwent away. Mr. Vanderpoel rose from an armchair to come forward to meet\nhis visitor. He was tall and straight--Betty had inherited her slender\nheight from him. His well-balanced face suggested the relationship\nbetween them. He had a steady mouth, and eyes which looked as if they\nsaw much and far.\n\n\"I am glad to see you, Mr. Selden,\" he said, shaking hands with\nhim. \"You have seen my daughters, and can tell me how they are. Miss\nVanderpoel has written to me of you several times.\"\n\nHe asked him to sit down, and as he took his chair Selden felt that he\nhad been right in telling himself that Reuben S. Vanderpoel would be\nsomehow like his girl. She was a girl, and he was an elderly man of\nbusiness, but they were like each other. There was the same kind of\nstraight way of doing things, and the same straight-seeing look in both\nof them.\n\nIt was queer how natural things seemed, when they really happened to a\nfellow. Here he was sitting in a big leather chair and opposite to him\nin its fellow sat Reuben S. Vanderpoel, looking at him with friendly\neyes. And it seemed all right, too--not as if he had managed to \"butt\nin,\" and would find himself politely fired out directly. He might have\nbeen one of the Four Hundred making a call. Reuben S. knew how to make\na man feel easy, and no mistake. This G. Selden observed at once, though\nhe had, in fact, no knowledge of the practical tact which dealt with\nhim. He found himself answering questions about Lady Anstruthers and\nher sister, which led to the opening up of other subjects. He did not\nrealise that he began to express ingenuous opinions and describe things.\nHis listener's interest led him on, a question here, a rather pleased\nlaugh there, were encouraging. He had enjoyed himself so much during his\nstay in England, and had felt his experiences so greatly to be rejoiced\nover, that they were easy to talk of at any time--in fact, it was even a\ntrifle difficult not to talk of them--but, stimulated by the look which\nrested on him, by the deft word and ready smile, words flowed readily\nand without the restraint of self-consciousness.\n\n\"When you think that all of it sort of began with a robin, it's queer\nenough,\" he said. \"But for that robin I shouldn't be here, sir,\" with a\nboyish laugh. \"And he was an English robin--a little fellow not half the\nsize of the kind that hops about Central Park.\"\n\n\"Let me hear about that,\" said Mr. Vanderpoel.\n\nIt was a good story, and he told it well, though in his own junior\nsalesman phrasing. He began with his bicycle ride into the green\ncountry, his spin over the fine roads, his rest under the hedge during\nthe shower, and then the song of the robin perched among the fresh wet\nleafage, his feathers puffed out, his red young satin-glossed breast\npulsating and swelling. His words were colloquial enough, but they\ncalled up the picture.\n\n\"Everything sort of glittering with the sunshine on the wet drops, and\nthings smelling good, like they do after rain--leaves, and grass, and\ngood earth. I tell you it made a fellow feel as if the whole world was\nhis brother. And when Mr. Rob. lit on that twig and swelled his red\nbreast as if he knew the whole thing was his, and began to let them\nnotes out, calling for his lady friend to come and go halves with him, I\njust had to laugh and speak to him, and that was when Lord Mount Dunstan\nheard me and jumped over the hedge. He'd been listening, too.\"\n\nThe expression Reuben S. Vanderpoel wore made it an agreeable thing to\ntalk--to go on. He evidently cared to hear. So Selden did his best,\nand enjoyed himself in doing it. His style made for realism and brought\nthings clearly before one. The big-built man in the rough and shabby\nshooting clothes, his way when he dropped into the grass to sit beside\nthe stranger and talk, certain meanings in his words which conveyed to\nVanderpoel what had not been conveyed to G. Selden. Yes, the man\ncarried a heaviness about with him and hated the burden. Selden quite\nunconsciously brought him out strongly.\n\n\"I don't know whether I'm the kind of fellow who is always making\nbreaks,\" he said, with his boy's laugh again, \"but if I am, I never made\na worse one than when I asked him straight if he was out of a job, and\non the tramp. It showed what a nice fellow he was that he didn't get hot\nabout it. Some fellows would. He only laughed--sort of short--and said\nhis job had been more than he could handle, and he was afraid he was\ndown and out.\"\n\nMr. Vanderpoel was conscious that so far he was somewhat attracted by\nthis central figure. G. Selden was also proving satisfactory in the\nmatter of revealing his excellently simple views of persons and things.\n\n\"The only time he got mad was when I wouldn't believe him when he told\nme who he was. I was a bit hot in the collar myself. I'd felt sorry for\nhim, because I thought he was a chap like myself, and he was up against\nit. I know what that is, and I'd wanted to jolly him along a bit. When\nhe said his name was Mount Dunstan, and the place belonged to him,\nI guessed he thought he was making a joke. So I got on my wheel and\nstarted off, and then he got mad for keeps. He said he wasn't such a\ndamned fool as he looked, and what he'd said was true, and I could go\nand be hanged.\"\n\nReuben S. Vanderpoel laughed. He liked that. It sounded like decent\nBritish hot temper, which he had often found accompanied honest British\ndecencies.\n\nHe liked other things, as the story proceeded. The picture of the huge\nhouse with the shut windows, made him slightly restless. The concealed\nimagination, combined with the financier's resentment of dormant\ninterests, disturbed him. That which had attracted Selden in the\nReverend Lewis Penzance strongly attracted himself. Also, a man was a\ngood deal to be judged by his friends. The man who lived alone in the\nmidst of stately desolateness and held as his chief intimate a high-bred\nand gentle-minded scholar of ripe years, gave, in doing this, certain\nevidence which did not tell against him. The whole situation meant\nsomething a splendid, vivid-minded young creature might be moved\nby--might be allured by, even despite herself.\n\nThere was something fantastic in the odd linking of incidents--Selden's\nchance view of Betty as she rode by, his next day's sudden resolve to\nturn back and go to Stornham, his accident, all that followed seemed, if\none were fanciful--part of a scheme prearranged\n\n\"When I came to myself,\" G. Selden said, \"I felt like that fellow in the\nShakespeare play that they dress up and put to bed in the palace when\nhe's drunk. I thought I'd gone off my head. And then Miss Vanderpoel\ncame.\" He paused a moment and looked down on the carpet, thinking. \"Gee\nwhiz! It WAS queer,\" he said.\n\nBetty Vanderpoel's father could almost hear her voice as the rest was\ntold. He knew how her laugh had sounded, and what her presence must\nhave been to the young fellow. His delightful, human, always satisfying\nBetty!\n\nThrough this odd trick of fortune, Mount Dunstan had begun to see her.\nSince, through the unfair endowment of Nature--that it was not wholly\nfair he had often told himself--she was all the things that desire could\nyearn for, there were many chances that when a man saw her he must long\nto see her again, and there were the same chances that such an one as\nMount Dunstan might long also, and, if Fate was against him, long with\na bitter strength. Selden was not aware that he had spoken more fully of\nMount Dunstan and his place than of other things. That this had been the\ncase, had been because Mr. Vanderpoel had intended it should be so. He\nhad subtly drawn out and encouraged a detailed account of the time\nspent at Mount Dunstan vicarage. It was easily encouraged. Selden's\naffectionate admiration for the vicar led him on to enthusiasm. The\nquiet house and garden, the old books, the afternoon tea under the\ncopper beech, and the long talks of old things, which had been so new to\nthe young New Yorker, had plainly made a mark upon his life, not likely\nto be erased even by the rush of after years.\n\n\"The way he knew history was what got me,\" he said. \"And the way you got\ninterested in it, when he talked. It wasn't just HISTORY, like you learn\nat school, and forget, and never see the use of, anyhow. It was things\nabout men, just like yourself--hustling for a living in their way, just\nas we're hustling in Broadway. Most of it was fighting, and there are\nmounds scattered about that are the remains of their forts and camps.\nRoman camps, some of them. He took me to see them. He had a little old\npony chaise we trundled about in, and he'd draw up and we'd sit and\ntalk. 'There were men here on this very spot,' he'd say, 'looking\nout for attack, eating, drinking, cooking their food, polishing their\nweapons, laughing, and shouting--MEN--Selden, fifty-five years before\nChrist was born--and sometimes the New Testament times seem to us so far\naway that they are half a dream.' That was the kind of thing he'd say,\nand I'd sometimes feel as if I heard the Romans shouting. The country\nabout there was full of queer places, and both he and Lord Dunstan knew\nmore about them than I know about Twenty-third Street.\"\n\n\"You saw Lord Mount Dunstan often?\" Mr. Vanderpoel suggested.\n\n\"Every day, sir. And the more I saw him, the more I got to like\nhim. He's all right. But it's hard luck to be fixed as he is--that's\nstone-cold truth. What's a man to do? The money he ought to have to keep\nup his place was spent before he was born. His father and his eldest\nbrother were a bum lot, and his grandfather and great-grandfather\nwere fools. He can't sell the place, and he wouldn't if he could.\nMr. Penzance was so fond of him that sometimes he'd say things. But,\"\nhastily, \"perhaps I'm talking too much.\"\n\n\"You happen to be talking about questions I have been greatly interested\nin. I have thought a good deal at times of the position of the holders\nof large estates they cannot afford to keep up. This special instance is\na case in point.\"\n\nG. Selden felt himself in luck again. Reuben S., quite evidently, found\nhis subject worthy of undivided attention. Selden had not heartily liked\nLord Mount Dunstan, and lived in the atmosphere surrounding him, looking\nabout him with sharp young New York eyes, without learning a good deal.\n\nHe had seen the practical hardship of the situation, and laid it bare.\n\n\"What Mr. Penzance says is that he's like the men that built things\nin the beginning--fought for them--fought Romans and Saxons and\nNormans--perhaps the whole lot at different times. I used to like to\nget Mr. Penzance to tell stories about the Mount Dunstans. They were\nsplendid. It must be pretty fine to look back about a thousand years and\nknow your folks have been something. All the same its pretty fierce to\nhave to stand alone at the end of it, not able to help yourself, because\nsome of your relations were crazy fools. I don't wonder he feels mad.\"\n\n\"Does he?\" Mr. Vanderpoel inquired.\n\n\"He's straight,\" said G. Selden sympathetically. \"He's all right. But\nonly money can help him, and he's got none, so he has to stand and stare\nat things falling to pieces. And--well, I tell you, Mr. Vanderpoel, he\nLOVES that place--he's crazy about it. And he's proud--I don't mean he's\ngot the swell-head, because he hasn't--but he's just proud. Now, for\ninstance, he hasn't any use for men like himself that marry just for\nmoney. He's seen a lot of it, and it's made him sick. He's not that\nkind.\"\n\nHe had been asked and had answered a good many questions before he went\naway, but each had dropped into the talk so incidentally that he had\nnot recognised them as queries. He did not know that Lord Mount Dunstan\nstood out a clearly defined figure in Mr. Vanderpoel's mind, a figure to\nbe reflected upon, and one not without its attraction.\n\n\"Miss Vanderpoel tells me,\" Mr. Vanderpoel said, when the interview was\ndrawing to a close, \"that you are an agent for the Delkoff typewriter.\"\n\nG. Selden flushed slightly.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" he answered, \"but I didn't----\"\n\n\"I hear that three machines are in use on the Stornham estate, and that\nthey have proved satisfactory.\"\n\n\"It's a good machine,\" said G. Selden, his flush a little deeper.\n\nMr. Vanderpoel smiled.\n\n\"You are a business-like young man,\" he said, \"and I have no doubt you\nhave a catalogue in your pocket.\"\n\nG. Selden was a business-like young man. He gave Mr. Vanderpoel one\nserious look, and the catalogue was drawn forth.\n\n\"It wouldn't be business, sir, for me to be caught out without it,\" he\nsaid. \"I shouldn't leave it behind if I went to a funeral. A man's got\nto run no risks.\"\n\n\"I should like to look at it.\"\n\nThe thing had happened. It was not a dream. Reuben S. Vanderpoel,\nclothed and in his right mind, had, without pressure being exerted upon\nhim, expressed his desire to look at the catalogue--to examine it--to\nhave it explained to him at length.\n\nHe listened attentively, while G. Selden did his best. He asked a\nquestion now and then, or made a comment. His manner was that of a\nthoroughly composed man of business, but he was remembering what Betty\nhad told him of the \"ten per,\" and a number of other things. He saw\nthe flush come and go under the still boyish skin, he observed that G.\nSelden's hand was not wholly steady, though he was making an effort not\nto seem excited. But he was excited. This actually meant--this thing so\nunimportant to multi-millionaires--that he was having his \"chance,\" and\nhis young fortunes were, perhaps, in the balance.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Reuben S., when he had finished, \"it seems a good,\nup-to-date machine.\"\n\n\"It's the best on the market,\" said G. Selden, \"out and out, the best.\"\n\n\"I understand you are only junior salesman?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Ten per and five dollars on every machine I sell. If I had a\nterritory, I should get ten.\"\n\n\"Then,\" reflectively, \"the first thing is to get a territory.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I shall get one in time, if I keep at it,\" said Selden\ncourageously.\n\n\"It is a good machine. I like it,\" said Mr. Vanderpoel. \"I can see a\ngood many places where it could be used. Perhaps, if you make it known\nat your office that when you are given a good territory, I shall\ngive preference to the Delkoff over other typewriting machines, it\nmight--eh?\"\n\nA light broke out upon G. Selden's countenance--a light radiant and\nmagnificent. He caught his breath. A desire to shout--to yell--to whoop,\nas when in the society of \"the boys,\" was barely conquered in time.\n\n\"Mr. Vanderpoel,\" he said, standing up, \"I--Mr. Vanderpoel--sir--I feel\nas if I was having a pipe dream. I'm not, am I?\"\n\n\"No,\" answered Mr. Vanderpoel, \"you are not. I like you, Mr. Selden. My\ndaughter liked you. I do not mean to lose sight of you. We will begin,\nhowever, with the territory, and the Delkoff. I don't think there will\nbe any difficulty about it.\"\n\n. . . . .\n\nTen minutes later G. Selden was walking down Fifth Avenue, wondering\nif there was any chance of his being arrested by a policeman upon the\ncharge that he was reeling, instead of walking steadily. He hoped he\nshould get back to the hall bedroom safely. Nick Baumgarten and Jem\nBolter both \"roomed\" in the house with him. He could tell them both.\nIt was Jem who had made up the yarn about one of them saving Reuben S.\nVanderpoel's life. There had been no life-saving, but the thing had come\ntrue.\n\n\"But, if it hadn't been for Lord Mount Dunstan,\" he said, thinking it\nover excitedly, \"I should never have seen Miss Vanderpoel, and, if it\nhadn't been for Miss Vanderpoel, I should never have got next to Reuben\nS. in my life. Both sides of the Atlantic Ocean got busy to do a good\nturn to Little Willie. Hully gee!\"\n\nIn his study Mr. Vanderpoel was rereading Betty's letters. He felt that\nhe had gained a certain knowledge of Lord Mount Dunstan.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX\n\nON THE MARSHES\n\nTHE marshes stretched mellow in the autumn sun, sheep wandered about,\nnibbling contentedly, or lay down to rest in groups, the sky reflecting\nitself in the narrow dykes gave a blue colour to the water, a scent of\nthe sea was in the air as one breathed it, flocks of plover rose, now\nand then, crying softly. Betty, walking with her dog, had passed a heron\nstanding at the edge of a pool.\n\nFrom her first discovery of them, she had been attracted by the marshes\nwith their English suggestion of the Roman Campagna, their broad expanse\nof level land spread out to the sun and wind, the thousands of white\nsheep dotted or clustered as far as eye could reach, the hues of the\nmarsh grass and the plants growing thick at the borders of the strips\nof water. Its beauty was all its own and curiously aloof from the\nsoftly-wooded, undulating world about it. Driving or walking along the\nhigh road--the road the Romans had built to London town long centuries\nago--on either side of one were meadows, farms, scattered cottages, and\nhop gardens, but beyond and below stretched the marsh land, golden and\ngrey, and always alluring one by its silence.\n\n\"I never pass it without wanting to go to it--to take solitary walks\nover it, to be one of the spots on it as the sheep are. It seems as if,\nlying there under the blue sky or the low grey clouds with all the world\nheld at bay by mere space and stillness, they must feel something we\nknow nothing of. I want to go and find out what it is.\"\n\nThis she had once said to Mount Dunstan.\n\nSo she had fallen into the habit of walking there with her dog at her\nside as her sole companion, for having need for time and space for\nthought, she had found them in the silence and aloofness.\n\nLife had been a vivid and pleasurable thing to her, as far as she could\nlook back upon it. She began to realise that she must have been very\nhappy, because she had never found herself desiring existence other than\nsuch as had come to her day by day. Except for her passionate childish\nregret at Rosy's marriage, she had experienced no painful feeling.\nIn fact, she had faced no hurt in her life, and certainly had been\nconfronted by no limitations. Arguing that girls in their teens usually\nfall in love, her father had occasionally wondered that she passed\nthrough no little episodes of sentiment, but the fact was that her\ninterests had been larger and more numerous than the interests of girls\ngenerally are, and her affectionate intimacy with himself had left no\nsuch small vacant spaces as are frequently filled by unimportant young\nemotions. Because she was a logical creature, and had watched life and\nthose living it with clear and interested eyes, she had not been blind\nto the path which had marked itself before her during the summer's\ngrowth and waning. She had not, at first, perhaps, known exactly when\nthings began to change for her--when the clarity of her mind began to be\ndisturbed. She had thought in the beginning--as people have a habit\nof doing--that an instance--a problem--a situation had attracted her\nattention because it was absorbing enough to think over. Her view of the\nmatter had been that as the same thing would have interested her father,\nit had interested herself. But from the morning when she had been\nconscious of the sudden fury roused in her by Nigel Anstruthers' ugly\nsneer at Mount Dunstan, she had better understood the thing which had\ncome upon her. Day by day it had increased and gathered power, and she\nrealised with a certain sense of impatience that she had not in any\ndegree understood it when she had seen and wondered at its effect on\nother women. Each day had been like a wave encroaching farther upon the\nshore she stood upon. At the outset a certain ignoble pride--she knew it\nignoble--filled her with rebellion. She had seen so much of this kind\nof situation, and had heard so much of the general comment. People had\nlearned how to sneer because experience had taught them. If she gave\nthem cause, why should they not sneer at her as at things? She recalled\nwhat she had herself thought of such things--the folly of them, the\nobviousness--the almost deserved disaster. She had arrogated to herself\njudgment of women--and men--who might, yes, who might have stood upon\ntheir strip of sand, as she stood, with the waves creeping in, each one\nhigher, stronger, and more engulfing than the last. There might have\nbeen those among them who also had knowledge of that sudden deadly\njoy at the sight of one face, at the drop of one voice. When that wave\nsubmerged one's pulsing being, what had the world to do with one--how\ncould one hear and think of what its speech might be? Its voice\nclamoured too far off.\n\nAs she walked across the marsh she was thinking this first phase over.\nShe had reached a new one, and at first she looked back with a faint,\neven rather hard, smile. She walked straight ahead, her mastiff, Roland,\npadding along heavily close at her side. How still and wide and golden\nit was; how the cry of plover and lifting trill of skylark assured one\nthat one was wholly encircled by solitude and space which were more\nenclosing than any walls! She was going to the mounds to which Mr.\nPenzance had trundled G. Selden in the pony chaise, when he had given\nhim the marvellous hour which had brought Roman camp and Roman legions\nto life again. Up on the largest hillock one could sit enthroned,\nresting chin in hand and looking out under level lids at the unstirring,\nsoftly-living loveliness of the marsh-land world. So she was presently\nseated, with her heavy-limbed Roland at her feet. She had come here to\ntry to put things clearly to herself, to plan with such reason as she\ncould control. She had begun to be unhappy, she had begun--with some\nunfairness--to look back upon the Betty Vanderpoel of the past as\nan unwittingly self-sufficient young woman, to find herself suddenly\nentangled by things, even to know a touch of desperateness.\n\n\"Not to take a remnant from the ducal bargain counter,\" she was saying\nmentally. That was why her smile was a little hard. What if the remnant\nfrom the ducal bargain counter had prejudices of his own?\n\n\"If he were passionately--passionately in love with me,\" she said, with\nred staining her cheeks, \"he would not come--he would not come--he would\nnot come. And, because of that, he is more to me--MORE! And more he will\nbecome every day--and the more strongly he will hold me. And there we\nstand.\"\n\nRoland lifted his fine head from his paws, and, holding it erect on a\nstiff, strong neck, stared at her in obvious inquiry. She put out her\nhand and tenderly patted him.\n\n\"He will have none of me,\" she said. \"He will have none of me.\" And she\nfaintly smiled, but the next instant shook her head a little haughtily,\nand, having done so, looked down with an altered expression upon the\ncloth of her skirt, because she had shaken upon it, from the extravagant\nlashes, two clear drops.\n\nIt was not the result of chance that she had seen nothing of him for\nweeks. She had not attempted to persuade herself of that. Twice he had\ndeclined an invitation to Stornham, and once he had ridden past her\non the road when he might have stopped to exchange greetings, or have\nridden on by her side. He did not mean to seem to desire, ever so\nlightly, to be counted as in the lists. Whether he was drawn by any\nliking for her or not, it was plain he had determined on this.\n\nIf she were to go away now, they would never meet again. Their ways in\nthis world would part forever. She would not know how long it took to\nbreak him utterly--if such a man could be broken. If no magic change\ntook place in his fortunes--and what change could come?--the decay\nabout him would spread day by day. Stone walls last a long time, so the\nhouse would stand while every beauty and stateliness within it fell into\nruin. Gardens would become wildernesses, terraces and fountains crumble\nand be overgrown, walls that were to-day leaning would fall with time.\nThe years would pass, and his youth with them; he would gradually change\ninto an old man while he watched the things he loved with passion die\nslowly and hard. How strange it was that lives should touch and pass on\nthe ocean of Time, and nothing should result--nothing at all! When she\nwent on her way, it would be as if a ship loaded with every aid of food\nand treasure had passed a boat in which a strong man tossed, starving to\ndeath, and had not even run up a flag.\n\n\"But one cannot run up a flag,\" she said, stroking Roland. \"One cannot.\nThere we stand.\"\n\nTo her recognition of this deadlock of Fate, there had been adding the\ngrowing disturbance caused by yet another thing which was increasingly\ntroubling, increasingly difficult to face.\n\nGradually, and at first with wonderful naturalness of bearing, Nigel\nAnstruthers had managed to create for himself a singular place in her\neveryday life. It had begun with a certain personalness in his attitude,\na personalness which was a thing to dislike, but almost impossible\nopenly to resent. Certainly, as a self-invited guest in his house, she\ncould scarcely protest against the amiability of his demeanour and his\nexterior courtesy and attentiveness of manner in his conduct towards\nher. She had tried to sweep away the objectionable quality in his\nbearing, by frankness, by indifference, by entire lack of response, but\nshe had remained conscious of its increasing as a spider's web might\nincrease as the spider spun it quietly over one, throwing out threads\nso impalpable that one could not brush them away because they were too\nslight to be seen. She was aware that in the first years of his married\nlife he had alternately resented the scarcity of the invitations sent\nthem and rudely refused such as were received. Since he had returned\nto find her at Stornham, he had insisted that no invitations should be\ndeclined, and had escorted his wife and herself wherever they went. What\ncould have been conventionally more proper--what more improper than that\nhe should have persistently have remained at home? And yet there came a\ntime when, as they three drove together at night in the closed carriage,\nBetty was conscious that, as he sat opposite to her in the dark, when he\nspoke, when he touched her in arranging the robe over her, or opening\nor shutting the window, he subtly, but persistently, conveyed that the\npersonalness of his voice, look, and physical nearness was a sort of\nhideous confidence between them which they were cleverly concealing from\nRosalie and the outside world.\n\nWhen she rode about the country, he had a way of appearing at some\nturning and making himself her companion, riding too closely at her\nside, and assuming a noticeable air of being engaged in meaningly\nconfidential talk. Once, when he had been leaning towards her with an\naudaciously tender manner, they had been passed by the Dunholm carriage,\nand Lady Dunholm and the friend driving with her had evidently tried not\nto look surprised. Lady Alanby, meeting them in the same way at another\ntime, had put up her glasses and stared in open disapproval. She might\nadmire a strikingly handsome American girl, but her favour would not\nlast through any such vulgar silliness as flirtations with disgraceful\nbrothers-in-law. When Betty strolled about the park or the lanes, she\nmuch too often encountered Sir Nigel strolling also, and knew that he\ndid not mean to allow her to rid herself of him. In public, he made a\npoint of keeping observably close to her, of hovering in her vicinity\nand looking on at all she did with eyes she rebelled against finding\nfixed on her each time she was obliged to turn in his direction. He had\na fashion of coming to her side and speaking in a dropped voice, which\nexcluded others, as a favoured lover might. She had seen both men and\nwomen glance at her in half-embarrassment at their sudden sense of\nfinding themselves slightly de trop. She had said aloud to him on one\nsuch occasion--and she had said it with smiling casualness for the\nbenefit of Lady Alanby, to whom she had been talking:\n\n\"Don't alarm me by dropping your voice, Nigel. I am easily\nfrightened--and Lady Alanby will think we are conspirators.\"\n\nFor an instant he was taken by surprise. He had been pleased to believe\nthat there was no way in which she could defend herself, unless she\nwould condescend to something stupidly like a scene. He flushed and drew\nhimself up.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, my dear Betty,\" he said, and walked away with\nthe manner of an offended adorer, leaving her to realise an odiously\nunpleasant truth--which is that there are incidents only made more\ninexplicable by an effort to explain. She saw also that he was\nquite aware of this, and that his offended departure was a brilliant\ninspiration, and had left her, as it were, in the lurch. To have said to\nLady Alanby: \"My brother-in-law, in whose house I am merely staying for\nmy sister's sake, is trying to lead you to believe that I allow him to\nmake love to me,\" would have suggested either folly or insanity on her\nown part. As it was--after a glance at Sir Nigel's stiffly retreating\nback--Lady Alanby merely looked away with a wholly uninviting\nexpression.\n\nWhen Betty spoke to him afterwards, haughtily and with determination, he\nlaughed.\n\n\"My dearest girl,\" he said, \"if I watch you with interest and drop my\nvoice when I get a chance to speak to you, I only do what every other\nman does, and I do it because you are an alluring young woman--which no\none is more perfectly aware of than yourself. Your pretence that you do\nnot know you are alluring is the most captivating thing about you. And\nwhat do you think of doing if I continue to offend you? Do you propose\nto desert us--to leave poor Rosalie to sink back again into the bundle\nof old clothes she was when you came? For Heaven's sake, don't do that!\"\n\nAll that his words suggested took form before her vividly. How well he\nunderstood what he was saying. But she answered him bravely.\n\n\"No. I do not mean to do that.\"\n\nHe watched her for a few seconds. There was curiosity in his eyes.\n\n\"Don't make the mistake of imagining that I will let my wife go with you\nto America,\" he said next. \"She is as far off from that as she was when\nI brought her to Stornham. I have told her so. A man cannot tie his wife\nto the bedpost in these days, but he can make her efforts to leave him\nso decidedly unpleasant that decent women prefer to stay at home and\ntake what is coming. I have seen that often enough 'to bank on it,' if I\nmay quote your American friends.\"\n\n\"Do you remember my once saying,\" Betty remarked, \"that when a woman has\nbeen PROPERLY ill-treated the time comes when nothing matters--nothing\nbut release from the life she loathes?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he answered. \"And to you nothing would matter but--excuse\nmy saying it--your own damnable, headstrong pride. But Rosalie is\ndifferent. Everything matters to her. And you will find it so, my dear\ngirl.\"\n\nAnd that this was at least half true was brought home to her by the fact\nthat late the same night Rosy came to her white with crying.\n\n\"It is not your fault, Betty,\" she said. \"Don't think that I think it is\nyour fault, but he has been in my room in one of those humours when he\nseems like a devil. He thinks you will go back to America and try to\ntake me with you. But, Betty, you must not think about me. It will be\nbetter for you to go. I have seen you again. I have had you for--for a\ntime. You will be safer at home with father and mother.\"\n\nBetty laid a hand on her shoulder and looked at her fixedly.\n\n\"What is it, Rosy?\" she said. \"What is it he does to you--that makes\nyou like this?\"\n\n\"I don't know--but that he makes me feel that there is nothing but\nevil and lies in the world and nothing can help one against them.\nThose things he says about everyone--men and women--things one can't\nrepeat--make me sick. And when I try to deny them, he laughs.\"\n\n\"Does he say things about me?\" Betty inquired, very quietly, and\nsuddenly Rosalie threw her arms round her.\n\n\"Betty, darling,\" she cried, \"go home--go home. You must not stay here.\"\n\n\"When I go, you will go with me,\" Betty answered. \"I am not going back\nto mother without you.\"\n\nShe made a collection of many facts before their interview was at an\nend, and they parted for the night. Among the first was that Nigel had\nprepared for certain possibilities as wise holders of a fortress prepare\nfor siege. A rather long sitting alone over whisky and soda had, without\nmaking him loquacious, heated his blood in such a manner as led him to\nbe less subtle than usual. Drink did not make him drunk, but malignant,\nand when a man is in the malignant mood, he forgets his cleverness. So\nhe revealed more than he absolutely intended. It was to be gathered that\nhe did not mean to permit his wife to leave him, even for a visit; he\nwould not allow himself to be made ridiculous by such a thing. A man\nwho could not control his wife was a fool and deserved to be a\nlaughing-stock. As Ughtred and his future inheritance seemed to have\nbecome of interest to his grandfather, and were to be well nursed and\ntaken care of, his intention was that the boy should remain under his\nown supervision. He could amuse himself well enough at Stornham, now\nthat it had been put in order, if it was kept up properly and he filled\nit with people who did not bore him. There were people who did not bore\nhim--plenty of them. Rosalie would stay where she was and receive his\nguests. If she imagined that the little episode of Ffolliott had been\nentirely dormant, she was mistaken. He knew where the man was, and\nexactly how serious it would be to him if scandal was stirred up. He had\nbeen at some trouble to find out. The fellow had recently had the luck\nto fall into a very fine living. It had been bestowed on him by the old\nDuke of Broadmorlands, who was the most strait-laced old boy in England.\nHe had become so in his disgust at the light behaviour of the wife he\nhad divorced in his early manhood. Nigel cackled gently as he detailed\nthat, by an agreeable coincidence, it happened that her Grace had\nsuddenly become filled with pious fervour--roused thereto by a\ngood-looking locum tenens--result, painful discoveries--the pair\nbeing now rumoured to be keeping a lodging-house together somewhere in\nAustralia. A word to good old Broadmorlands would produce the effect\nof a lighted match on a barrel of gunpowder. It would be the end of\nFfolliott. Neither would it be a good introduction to Betty's first\nseason in London, neither would it be enjoyed by her mother, whom he\nremembered as a woman with primitive views of domestic rectitude.\nHe smiled the awful smile as he took out of his pocket the envelope\ncontaining the words his wife had written to Mr. Ffolliott, \"Do not come\nto the house. Meet me at Bartyon Wood.\" It did not take much to convince\npeople, if one managed things with decent forethought. The Brents, for\ninstance, were fond neither of her nor of Betty, and they had never\nforgotten the questionable conduct of their locum tenens. Then,\nsuddenly, he had changed his manner and had sat down, laughing, and\ndrawn Rosalie to his knee and kissed her--yes, he had kissed her\nand told her not to look like a little fool or act like one. Nothing\nunpleasant would happen if she behaved herself. Betty had improved her\ngreatly, and she had grown young and pretty again. She looked quite like\na child sometimes, now that her bones were covered and she dressed well.\nIf she wanted to please him she could put her arms round his neck and\nkiss him, as he had kissed her.\n\n\"That is what has made you look white,\" said Betty.\n\n\"Yes. There is something about him that sometimes makes you feel as\nif the very blood in your veins turned white,\" answered Rosy--in a low\nvoice, which the next moment rose. \"Don't you see--don't you see,\"\nshe broke out, \"that to displease him would be like murdering Mr.\nFfolliott--like murdering his mother and mine--and like murdering\nUghtred, because he would be killed by the shame of things--and by being\ntaken from me. We have loved each other so much--so much. Don't you\nsee?\"\n\n\"I see all that rises up before you,\" Betty said, \"and I understand your\nfeeling that you cannot save yourself by bringing ruin upon an innocent\nman who helped you. I realise that one must have time to think it over.\nBut, Rosy,\" a sudden ring in her voice, \"I tell you there is a way\nout--there is a way out! The end of the misery is coming--and it will\nnot be what he thinks.\"\n\n\"You always believe----\" began Rosy.\n\n\"I know,\" answered Betty. \"I know there are some things so bad that they\ncannot go on. They kill themselves through their own evil. I KNOW! I\nKNOW! That is all.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LX\n\n\"DON'T GO ON WITH THIS\"\n\nOf these things, as of others, she had come to her solitude to think.\nShe looked out over the marshes scarcely seeing the wandering or resting\nsheep, scarcely hearing the crying plover, because so much seemed\nto confront her, and she must look it all well in the face. She had\nfulfilled the promise she had made to herself as a child. She had come\nin search of Rosy, she had found her as simple and loving of heart as\nshe had ever been. The most painful discoveries she had made had\nbeen concealed from her mother until their aspect was modified. Mrs.\nVanderpoel need now feel no shock at the sight of the restored Rosy.\nLady Anstruthers had been still young enough to respond both physically\nand mentally to love, companionship, agreeable luxuries, and stimulating\ninterests. But for Nigel's antagonism there was now no reason why\nshe should not be taken home for a visit to her family, and her\nlong-yearned-for New York, no reason why her father and mother should\nnot come to Stornham, and thus establish the customary social relations\nbetween their daughter's home and their own. That this seemed out of the\nquestion was owing to the fact that at the outset of his married life\nSir Nigel had allowed himself to commit errors in tactics. A perverse\negotism, not wholly normal in its rancour, had led him into deeds which\nhe had begun to suspect of having cost him too much, even before Betty\nherself had pointed out to him their unbusinesslike indiscretion. He had\ndone things he could not undo, and now, to his mind, his only resource\nwas to treat them boldly as having been the proper results of decision\nfounded on sound judgment, which he had no desire to excuse. A\nsufficiently arrogant loftiness of bearing would, he hoped, carry him\nthrough the matter. This Betty herself had guessed, but she had not\nrealised that this loftiness of attitude was in danger of losing some\nof its effectiveness through his being increasingly stung and spurred\nby circumstances and feelings connected with herself, which were at\nonce exasperating and at times almost overpowering. When, in his mingled\ndislike and admiration, he had begun to study his sister-in-law, and\nthe half-amused weaving of the small plots which would make things\nsufficiently unpleasant to be used as factors in her removal from the\nscene, if necessary, he had not calculated, ever so remotely, on the\nchance of that madness besetting him which usually besets men only\nin their youth. He had imagined no other results to himself than a\nsubtly-exciting private entertainment, such as would give spice to the\ndullness of virtuous life in the country. But, despite himself and his\nintentions, he had found the situation alter. His first uncertainty of\nhimself had arisen at the Dunholm ball, when he had suddenly realised\nthat he was detesting men who, being young and free, were at liberty to\npay gallant court to the new beauty.\n\nPerhaps the most disturbing thing to him had been his consciousness of\nhis sudden leap of antagonism towards Mount Dunstan, who, despite his\nobvious lack of chance, somehow especially roused in him the rage of\nwarring male instinct. There had been admissions he had been forced,\nat length, to make to himself. You could not, it appeared, live in the\nhouse with a splendid creature like this one--with her brilliant eyes,\nher beauty of line and movement before you every hour, her bloom, her\nproud fineness holding themselves wholly in their own keeping--without\nthere being the devil to pay. Lately he had sometimes gone hot and cold\nin realising that, having once told himself that he might choose to\ndecide to get rid of her, he now knew that the mere thought of her\nsailing away of her own choice was maddening to him. There WAS the devil\nto pay! It sometimes brought back to him that hideous shakiness of nerve\nwhich had been a feature of his illness when he had been on the Riviera\nwith Teresita.\n\nOf all this Betty only knew the outward signs which, taken at their\nexterior significance, were detestable enough, and drove her hard as she\nmentally dwelt on them in connection with other things. How easy, if she\nstood alone, to defy his evil insolence to do its worst, and leaving the\nplace at an hour's notice, to sail away to protection, or, if she chose\nto remain in England, to surround herself with a bodyguard of the people\nin whose eyes his disrepute relegated a man such as Nigel Anstruthers\nto powerless nonentity. Alone, she could have smiled and turned her back\nupon him. But she was here to take care of Rosy. She occupied a position\nsomething like that of a woman who remains with a man and endures\noutrage because she cannot leave her child. That thought, in itself,\nbrought Ughtred to her mind. There was Ughtred to be considered as\nwell as his mother. Ughtred's love for and faith in her were deep and\npassionate things. He fed on her tenderness for him, and had grown\nstronger because he spent hours of each day talking, reading, and\ndriving with her. The simple truth was that neither she nor Rosalie\ncould desert Ughtred, and so long as Nigel managed cleverly enough, the\nlaw would give the boy to his father.\n\n\"You are obliged to prove things, you know, in a court of law,\" he had\nsaid, as if with casual amiability, on a certain occasion. \"Proving\nthings is the devil. People lose their tempers and rush into rows which\nend in lawsuits, and then find they can prove nothing. If I were a\nvillain,\" slightly showing his teeth in an agreeable smile--\"instead\nof a man of blameless life, I should go in only for that branch of my\nprofession which could be exercised without leaving stupid evidence\nbehind.\"\n\nSince his return to Stornham the outward decorum of his own conduct had\nentertained him and he had kept it up with an increasing appreciation of\nits usefulness in the present situation. Whatsoever happened in the end,\nit was the part of discretion to present to the rural world about him an\nappearance of upright behaviour. He had even found it amusing to go to\nchurch and also to occasionally make amiable calls at the vicarage. It\nwas not difficult, at such times, to refer delicately to his regret that\ndomestic discomfort had led him into the error of remaining much away\nfrom Stornham. He knew that he had been even rather touching in his\nexpression of interest in the future of his son, and the necessity of\nthe boy's being protected from uncontrolled hysteric influences. And, in\nthe years of Rosalie's unprotected wretchedness, he had taken excellent\ncare that no \"stupid evidence\" should be exposed to view.\n\nOf all this Betty was thinking and summing up definitely, point after\npoint. Where was the wise and practical course of defence? The most\nunthinkable thing was that one could find one's self in a position in\nwhich action seemed inhibited. What could one do? To send for her father\nwould surely end the matter--but at what cost to Rosy, to Ughtred, to\nFfolliott, before whom the fair path to dignified security had so newly\nopened itself? What would be the effect of sudden confusion, anguish,\nand public humiliation upon Rosalie's carefully rebuilt health and\nstrength--upon her mother's new hope and happiness? At moments it seemed\nas if almost all that had been done might be undone. She was beset by\nsuch a moment now, and felt for the time, at least, like a creature tied\nhand and foot while in full strength.\n\nCertainly she was not prepared for the event which happened. Roland\nstiffened his ears, and, beginning a rumbling growl, ended it suddenly,\nrealising it an unnecessary precaution.\n\nHe knew the man walking up the incline of the mound from the side behind\nthem. So did Betty know him. It was Sir Nigel looking rather glowering\nand pale and walking slowly. He had discovered where she had meant to\ntake refuge, and had probably ridden to some point where he could leave\nhis horse and follow her at the expense of taking a short cut which\nsaved walking.\n\nAs he climbed the mound to join her, Betty rose to her feet.\n\n\"My dear girl,\" he said, \"don't get up as if you meant to go away. It\nhas cost me some exertion to find you.\"\n\n\"It will not cost you any exertion to lose me,\" was her light answer. \"I\nAM going away.\"\n\nHe had reached her, and stood still before her with scarcely a yard's\ndistance between them. He was slightly out of breath and even a trifle\nlivid. He leaned on his stick and his look at her combined leaping bad\ntemper with something deeper.\n\n\"Look here!\" he broke out, \"why do you make such a point of treating me\nlike the devil?\"\n\nBetty felt her heart give a hastened beat, not of fear, but of\nrepulsion. This was the mood and manner which subjugated Rosalie. He had\nso raised his voice that two men in the distance, who might be either\nlabourers or sportsmen, hearing its high tone, glanced curiously towards\nthem.\n\n\"Why do you ask me a question which is totally absurd?\" she said.\n\n\"It is not absurd,\" he answered. \"I am speaking of facts, and I intend\nto come to some understanding about them.\"\n\nFor reply, after meeting his look a few seconds, she simply turned her\nback and began to walk away. He followed and overtook her.\n\n\"I shall go with you, and I shall say what I want to say,\" he persisted.\n\"If you hasten your pace I shall hasten mine. I cannot exactly see you\nrunning away from me across the marsh, screaming. You wouldn't care to\nbe rescued by those men over there who are watching us. I should explain\nmyself to them in terms neither you nor Rosalie would enjoy. There! I\nknew Rosalie's name would pull you up. Good God! I wish I were a weak\nfool with a magnificent creature protecting me at all risks.\"\n\nIf she had not had blood and fire in her veins, she might have found\nit easy to answer calmly. But she had both, and both leaped and beat\nfuriously for a few seconds. It was only human that it should be so. But\nshe was more than a passionate girl of high and trenchant spirit, and\nshe had learned, even in the days at the French school, what he had\nnever been able to learn in his life--self-control. She held herself in\nas she would have held in a horse of too great fire and action. She\nwas actually able to look--as the first Reuben Vanderpoel would have\nlooked--at her capital of resource. But it meant taut holding of the\nreins.\n\n\"Will you tell me,\" she said, stopping, \"what it is you want?\"\n\n\"I want to talk to you. I want to tell you truths you would rather\nbe told here than on the high road, where people are passing--or at\nStornham, where the servants would overhear and Rosalie be thrown into\nhysterics. You will NOT run screaming across the marsh, because I should\nrun screaming after you, and we should both look silly. Here is a rather\nscraggy tree. Will you sit on the mound near it--for Rosalie's sake?\"\n\n\"I will not sit down,\" replied Betty, \"but I will listen, because it is\nnot a bad idea that I should understand you. But to begin with, I will\ntell you something.\" She stopped beneath the tree and stood with her\nback against its trunk. \"I pick up things by noticing people closely,\nand I have realised that all your life you have counted upon getting\nyour own way because you saw that people--especially women--have a\nhorror of public scenes, and will submit to almost anything to avoid\nthem. That is true very often, but not always.\"\n\nHer eyes, which were well opened, were quite the blue of steel, and\nrested directly upon him. \"I, for instance, would let you make a scene\nwith me anywhere you chose--in Bond Street--in Piccadilly--on the steps\nof Buckingham Palace, as I was getting out of my carriage to attend a\ndrawing-room--and you would gain nothing you wanted by it--nothing. You\nmay place entire confidence in that statement.\"\n\nHe stared back at her, momentarily half-magnetised, and then broke forth\ninto a harsh half-laugh.\n\n\"You are so damned handsome that nothing else matters. I'm hanged if it\ndoes!\" and the words were an exclamation. He drew still nearer to her,\nspeaking with a sort of savagery. \"Cannot you see that you could do\nwhat you pleased with me? You are too magnificent a thing for a man to\nwithstand. I have lost my head and gone to the devil through you. That\nis what I came to say.\"\n\nIn the few seconds of silence that followed, his breath came quickly\nagain and he was even paler than before.\n\n\"You came to me to say THAT?\" asked Betty.\n\n\"Yes--to say it before you drove me to other things.\"\n\nHer gaze was for a moment even slightly wondering. He presented the\ncurious picture of a cynical man of the world, for the time being ruled\nand impelled only by the most primitive instincts. To a clear-headed\nmodern young woman of the most powerful class, he--her sister's\nhusband--was making threatening love as if he were a savage chief and\nshe a savage beauty of his tribe. All that concerned him was that he\nshould speak and she should hear--that he should show her he was the\nstronger of the two.\n\n\"Are you QUITE mad?\" she said.\n\n\"Not quite,\" he answered; \"only three parts--but I am beyond my own\ncontrol. That is the best proof of what has happened to me. You are an\narrogant piece and you would defy me if you stood alone, but you don't,\nand, by the Lord! I have reached a point where I will make use of every\nlever I can lay my hand on--yourself, Rosalie, Ughtred, Ffolliott--the\nwhole lot of you!\"\n\nThe thing which was hardest upon her was her knowledge of her own\nstrength--of what she might have allowed herself of flaming words and\ninstant action--but for the memory of Rosy's ghastly little face, as\nit had looked when she cried out, \"You must not think of me. Betty, go\nhome--go home!\" She held the white desperation of it before her mental\nvision and answered him even with a certain interested deliberateness.\n\n\"Do you know,\" she inquired, \"that you are talking to me as though you\nwere the villain in the melodrama?\"\n\n\"There is an advantage in that,\" he answered, with an unholy smile. \"If\nyou repeat what I say, people will only think that you are indulging\nin hysterical exaggeration. They don't believe in the existence of\nmelodrama in these days.\"\n\nThe cynical, absolute knowledge of this revealed so much that nerve was\nrequired to face it with steadiness.\n\n\"True,\" she commented. \"Now I think I understand.\"\n\n\"No, you don't,\" he burst forth. \"You have spent your life standing on a\ngolden pedestal, being kowtowed to, and you imagine yourself immune from\ndifficulties because you think you can pay your way out of anything. But\nyou will find that you cannot pay your way out of this--or rather you\ncannot pay Rosalie's way out of it.\"\n\n\"I shall not try. Go on,\" said the girl. \"What I do not understand, you\nmust explain to me. Don't leave anything unsaid.\"\n\n\"Good God, what a woman you are!\" he cried out bitterly. He had never\nseen such beauty in his life as he saw in her as she stood with her\nstraight young body flat against the tree. It was not a matter of deep\ncolour of eye, or high spirit of profile--but of something which burned\nhim. Still as she was, she looked like a flame. She made him feel old\nand body-worn, and all the more senselessly furious.\n\n\"I believe you hate me,\" he raged. \"And I may thank my wife for that.\"\nThen he lost himself entirely. \"Why cannot you behave well to me? If you\nwill behave well to me, Rosalie shall go her own way. If you even\nlooked at me as you look at other men--but you do not. There is always\nsomething under your lashes which watches me as if I were a wild beast\nyou were studying. Don't fancy yourself a dompteuse. I am not your man.\nI swear to you that you don't know what you are dealing with. I swear\nto you that if you play this game with me I will drag you two down if I\ndrag myself with you. I have nothing much to lose. You and your sister\nhave everything.\"\n\n\"Go on,\" Betty said briefly.\n\n\"Go on! Yes, I will go on. Rosalie and Ffolliott I hold in the hollow\nof my hand. As for you--do you know that people are beginning to discuss\nyou? Gossip is easily stirred in the country, where people are so bored\nthat they chatter in self-defence. I have been considered a bad lot. I\nhave become curiously attached to my sister-in-law. I am seen hanging\nabout her, hanging over her as we ride or walk alone together. An\nAmerican young woman is not like an English girl--she is used to seeing\nthe marriage ceremony juggled with. There's a trifle of prejudice\nagainst such young women when they are too rich and too handsome. Don't\nlook at me like that!\" he burst forth, with maddened sharpness, \"I won't\nhave it!\"\n\nThe girl was regarding him with the expression he most resented--the\nreflection of a normal person watching an abnormal one, and studying his\nabnormality.\n\n\"Do you know that you are raving?\" she said, with quiet\ncuriosity--\"raving?\"\n\nSuddenly he sat down on the low mound near him, and as he touched his\nforehead with his handkerchief, she saw that his hand actually shook.\n\n\"Yes,\" he answered, panting, \"but 'ware my ravings! They mean what they\nsay.\"\n\n\"You do yourself an injury when you give way to them\"--steadily, even\nwith a touch of slow significance--\"a physical injury. I have noticed\nthat more than once.\"\n\nHe sprang to his feet again. Every drop of blood left his face. For\na second he looked as if he would strike her. His arm actually flung\nitself out--and fell.\n\n\"You devil!\" he gasped. \"You count on that? You she-devil!\"\n\nShe left her tree and stood before him.\n\n\"Listen to me,\" she said. \"You intimate that you have been laying\nmelodramatic plots against me which will injure my good name. That\nis rubbish. Let us leave it at that. You threaten that you will break\nRosy's heart and take her child from her, you say also that you will\nwound and hurt my mother to her death and do your worst to ruin an\nhonest man----\"\n\n\"And, by God, I will!\" he raged. \"And you cannot stop me, if----\"\n\n\"I do not know whether I can stop you or not, though you may be sure\nI will try,\" she interrupted him, \"but that is not what I was going to\nsay.\" She drew a step nearer, and there was something in the intensity\nof her look which fascinated and held him for a moment. She was\ncuriously grave. \"Nigel, I believe in certain things you do not believe\nin. I believe black thoughts breed black ills to those who think them.\nIt is not a new idea. There is an old Oriental proverb which says,\n'Curses, like chickens, come home to roost.' I believe also that\nthe worst--the very worst CANNOT be done to those who think\nsteadily--steadily--only of the best. To you that is merely superstition\nto be laughed at. That is a matter of opinion. But--don't go on with\nthis thing--DON'T GO ON WITH IT. Stop and think it over.\"\n\nHe stared at her furiously--tried to laugh outright, and failed because\nthe look in her eyes was so odd in its strength and stillness.\n\n\"You think you can lay some weird spell upon me,\" he jeered\nsardonically.\n\n\"No, I don't,\" she answered. \"I could not if I would. It is no affair of\nmine. It is your affair only--and there is nothing weird about it. Don't\ngo on, I tell you. Think better of it.\"\n\nShe turned about without further speech, and walked away from him with\nlight swiftness over the marsh. Oddly enough, he did not even attempt to\nfollow her. He felt a little weak--perhaps because a certain thing she\nhad said had brought back to him a familiar touch of the horrors. She\nhad the eyes of a falcon under the odd, soft shade of the extraordinary\nlashes. She had seen what he thought no one but himself had realised.\nHaving watched her retreating figure for a few seconds, he sat down--as\nsuddenly as before--on the mound near the tree.\n\n\"Oh, damn her!\" he said, his damp forehead on his hands. \"Damn the whole\nuniverse!\"\n\n. . . . .\n\nWhen Betty and Roland reached Stornham, the wicker-work pony chaise from\nthe vicarage stood before the stone entrance steps. The drawing-room\ndoor was open, and Mrs. Brent was standing near it saying some last\nwords to Lady Anstruthers before leaving the house, after a visit\nevidently made with an object. This Betty gathered from the solemnity of\nher manner.\n\n\"Betty,\" said Lady Anstruthers, catching sight of her, \"do come in for a\nmoment.\"\n\nWhen Betty entered, both her sister and Mrs. Brent looked at her\nquestioningly.\n\n\"You look a little pale and tired, Miss Vanderpoel,\" Mrs. Brent said,\nrather as if in haste to be the first to speak. \"I hope you are not at\nall unwell. We need all our strength just now. I have brought the most\npainful news. Malignant typhoid fever has broken out among the hop\npickers on the Mount Dunstan estate. Some poor creature was evidently\nsickening for it when he came from London. Three people died last\nnight.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI\n\nSHE WOULD DO SOMETHING\n\nSir Nigel's face was not a good thing to see when he appeared at the\ndinner table in the evening. As he took his seat the two footmen glanced\nquickly at each other, and the butler at the sideboard furtively thrust\nout his underlip. Not a man or woman in the household but had learned\nthe signal denoting the moment when no service would please, no word\nor movement be unobjectionable. Lady Anstruthers' face unconsciously\nassumed its propitiatory expression, and she glanced at her sister more\nthan once when Betty was unaware that she did so.\n\nUntil the soup had been removed, Sir Nigel scarcely spoke, merely making\ncurt replies to any casual remark. This was one of his simple and most\nengaging methods of at once enjoying an ill-humour and making his wife\nfeel that she was in some way to blame for it.\n\n\"Mount Dunstan is in a deucedly unpleasant position,\" he condescended at\nlast. \"I should not care to stand in his shoes.\"\n\nHe had not returned to the Court until late in the afternoon, but having\nheard in the village the rumour of the outbreak of fever, he had made\ninquiries and gathered detail.\n\n\"You are thinking of the outbreak of typhoid among the hop pickers?\"\nsaid Lady Anstruthers. \"Mrs. Brent thinks it threatens to be very\nserious.\"\n\n\"An epidemic, without a doubt,\" he answered. \"In a wretched unsanitary\nplace like Dunstan village, the wretches will die like flies.\"\n\n\"What will be done?\" inquired Betty.\n\nHe gave her one of the unpleasant personal glances and laughed\nderisively.\n\n\"Done? The county authorities, who call themselves 'guardians,' will be\nfrightened to death and will potter about and fuss like old women, and\nprofess to examine and protect and lay restrictions, but everyone will\nmanage to keep at a discreet distance, and the thing will run riot and\ndo its worst. As far as one can see, there seems no reason why the whole\nplace should not be swept away. No doubt Mount Dunstan has wisely taken\nto his heels already.\"\n\n\"I think that, on the contrary, there would be much doubt of that,\"\nBetty said. \"He would stay and do what he could.\"\n\nSir Nigel shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Would he? I think you'll find he would not.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Brent tells me,\" Rosalie broke in somewhat hurriedly, \"that the\nhuts for the hoppers are in the worst possible condition. They are so\ndilapidated that the rain pours into them. There is no proper shelter\nfor the people who are ill, and Lord Mount Dunstan cannot afford to take\ncare of them.\"\n\n\"But he WILL--he WILL,\" broke forth Betty. Her head lifted itself and\nshe spoke almost as if through her small, shut teeth. A wave of intense\nbelief--high, proud, and obstinate, swept through her. It was a feeling\nso strong and vibrant that she felt as if Mount Dunstan himself must be\nreached and upborne by it--as if he himself must hear her.\n\nRosalie looked at her half-startled, and, for the moment held fascinated\nby the sudden force rising in her and by the splendid spark of light\nunder her lids. She was reminded of the fierce little Betty of long ago,\nwith her delicate, indomitable small face and the spirit which even at\nnine years old had somehow seemed so strong and straitly keen of sight\nthat one had known it might always be trusted. Actually, in one way, she\nhad not changed. She saw the truth of things. The next instant, however,\ninadvertently glancing towards her husband, she caught her breath\nquickly. Across his heavy-featured face had shot the sudden gleam of a\nnew expression. It was as if he had at the moment recognised something\nwhich filled him with a rush of fury he himself was not prepared for.\nThat he did not wish it to be seen she knew by his manner. There was\na brief silence in which it passed away. He spoke after it, with\ndisagreeable precision.\n\n\"He has had an enormous effect on you--that man,\" he said to Betty.\n\nHe spoke clearly so that she might have the pleasure of being certain\nthat the menservants heard. They were close to the table, handing\nfruit--professing to be automatons, eyes down, faces expressing nothing,\nbut as quick of hearing as it is said that blind men are. He knew that\nif he had been in her place and a thing as insultingly significant\nhad been said to him, he should promptly have hurled the nearest\nobject--plate, wineglass, or decanter--in the face of the speaker.\nHe knew, too, that women cannot hurl projectiles without looking like\nviragos and fools. The weakly-feminine might burst into tears or into a\nsilly rage and leave the table. There was a distinct breath's space\nof pause, and Betty, cutting a cluster from a bunch of hothouse grapes\npresented by the footman at her side, answered as clearly as he had\nspoken himself.\n\n\"He is strong enough to produce an effect on anyone,\" she said. \"I think\nyou feel that yourself. He is a man who will not be beaten in the end.\nFortune will give him some good thing.\"\n\n\"He is a fellow who knows well enough on which hand of him good things\nlie,\" he said. \"He will take all that offers itself.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" Betty said impartially.\n\n\"There must be no riding or driving in the neighbourhood of the place,\"\nhe said next. \"I will have no risks run.\" He turned and addressed the\nbutler. \"Jennings, tell the servants that those are my orders.\"\n\nHe sat over his wine but a short time that evening, and when he joined\nhis wife and sister-in-law in the drawing-room he went at once to Betty.\nIn fact, he was in the condition when a man cannot keep away from\na woman, but must invent some reason for reaching her whether it is\nfatuous or plausible.\n\n\"What I said to Jennings was an order to you as well as to the people\nbelow stairs. I know you are particularly fond of riding in the\ndirection of Mount Dunstan. You are in my care so long as you are in my\nhouse.\"\n\n\"Orders are not necessary,\" Betty replied. \"The day is past when one\nrushed to smooth pillows and give the wrong medicine when one's friends\nwere ill. If one is not a properly-trained nurse, it is wiser not to\nrisk being very much in the way.\"\n\nHe spoke over her shoulder, dropping his voice, though Lady Anstruthers\nsat apart, appearing to read.\n\n\"Don't think I am fool enough not to understand. You have yourself under\nmagnificent control, but a woman passionately in love cannot keep a\ncertain look out of her eyes.\"\n\nHe was standing on the hearth. Betty swung herself lightly round, facing\nhim squarely. Her full look was splendid.\n\n\"If it is there--let it stay,\" she said. \"I would not keep it out of my\neyes if I could, and, you are right, I could not if I would--if it is\nthere. If it is--let it stay.\"\n\nThe daring, throbbing, human truth of her made his brain whirl. To a man\nyoung and clean and fit to count as in the lists, to have heard her say\nthe thing of a rival would have been hard enough, but base, degenerate,\nand of the world behind her day, to hear it while frenzied for her, was\nintolerable. And it was Mount Dunstan she bore herself so highly for.\nWhether melodrama is out of date or not there are, occasionally, some\nfine melodramatic touches in the enmities of to-day.\n\n\"You think you will reach him,\" he persisted. \"You think you will help\nhim in some way. You will not let the thing alone.\"\n\n\"Excuse my mentioning that whatsoever I take the liberty of doing will\nencroach on no right of yours,\" she said.\n\nBut, alone in her room, after she went upstairs, the face reflecting\nitself in the mirror was pale and its black brows were drawn together.\n\nShe sat down at the dressing-table, and, seeing the paled face, drew the\nblack brows closer, confronting a complicating truth.\n\n\"If I were free to take Rosalie and Ughtred home to-morrow,\" she\nthought, \"I could not bear to go. I should suffer too much.\"\n\nShe was suffering now. The strong longing in her heart was like\na physical pain. No word or look of this one man had given\nher proof that his thoughts turned to her, and yet it was\nintolerable--intolerable--that in his hour of stress and need they were\nas wholly apart as if worlds rolled between them. At any dire moment it\nwas mere nature that she should give herself in help and support. If, on\nthe night at sea, when they had first spoken to each other, the ship\nhad gone down, she knew that they two, strangers though they were, would\nhave worked side by side among the frantic people, and have been among\nthe last to take to the boats. How did she know? Only because, he being\nhe, and she being she, it must have been so in accordance with the\nlaws ruling entities. And now he stood facing a calamity almost as\nterrible--and she with full hands sat still.\n\nShe had seen the hop pickers' huts and had recognised their condition.\nMere brick sheds in which the pickers slept upon bundles of hay or straw\nin their best days; in their decay they did not even provide shelter. In\nfine weather the hop gatherers slept well enough in them, cooking their\nfood in gypsy-fashion in the open. When the rain descended, it must\nrun down walls and drip through the holes in the roofs in streams which\nwould soak clothes and bedding. The worst that Nigel and Mrs. Brent had\nimplied was true. Illness of any order, under such circumstances, would\nhave small chance of recovery, but malignant typhoid without shelter,\nwithout proper nourishment or nursing, had not one chance in a\nmillion. And he--this one man--stood alone in the midst of the\ntragedy--responsible and helpless. He would feel himself responsible\nas she herself would, if she were in his place. She was conscious that\nsuddenly the event of the afternoon--the interview upon the marshes, had\nreceded until it had become an almost unmeaning incident. What did the\ndegenerate, melodramatic folly matter----!\n\nShe had restlessly left her chair before the dressing-table, and was\nwalking to and fro. She paused and stood looking down at the carpet,\nthough she scarcely saw it.\n\n\"Nothing matters but one thing--one person,\" she owned to herself\naloud. \"I suppose it is always like this. Rosy, Ughtred, even father and\nmother--everyone seems less near than they were. It is too strong--too\nstrong. It is----\" the words dropped slowly from her lips, \"the\nstrongest thing--in the world.\"\n\nShe lifted her face and threw out her hands, a lovely young half-sad\nsmile curling the deep corners of her mouth. \"Sometimes one feels so\ndisdained,\" she said--\"so disdained with all one's power. Perhaps I am\nan unwanted thing.\"\n\nBut even in this case there were aids one might make an effort to give.\nShe went to her writing-table and sat thinking for some time. Afterwards\nshe began to write letters. Three or four were addressed to London--one\nwas to Mr. Penzance.\n\n. . . . .\n\nMount Dunstan and his vicar were walking through the village to the\nvicarage. They had been to the hop pickers' huts to see the people\nwho were ill of the fever. Both of them noticed that cottage doors and\nwindows were shut, and that here and there alarmed faces looked out from\nbehind latticed panes.\n\n\"They are in a panic of fear,\" Mount Dunstan said, \"and by way of\nsafeguard they shut out every breath of air and stifle indoors.\nSomething must be done.\"\n\nCatching the eye of a woman who was peering over her short white dimity\nblind, he beckoned to her authoritatively. She came to the door and\nhesitated there, curtsying nervously.\n\nMount Dunstan spoke to her across the hedge.\n\n\"You need not come out to me, Mrs. Binner. You may stay where you are,\"\nhe said. \"Are you obeying the orders given by the Guardians?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord. Yes, my lord,\" with more curtsys.\n\n\"Your health is very much in your own hands,\" he added.\n\n\"You must keep your cottage and your children cleaner than you have ever\nkept them before, and you must use the disinfectant I sent you. Keep\naway from the huts, and open your windows. If you don't open them,\nI shall come and do it for you. Bad air is infection itself. Do you\nunderstand?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord. Thank your lordship.\"\n\n\"Go in and open your windows now, and tell your neighbours to do the\nsame. If anyone is ill let me know at once. The vicar and I will do our\nbest for everyone.\"\n\nBy that time curiosity had overcome fear, and other cottage doors had\nopened. Mount Dunstan passed down the row and said a few words to each\nwoman or man who looked out. Questions were asked anxiously and he\nanswered them. That he was personally unafraid was comfortingly plain,\nand the mere sight of him was, on the whole, an unexplainable support.\n\n\"We heard said your lordship was going away,\" put in a stout mother\nwith a heavy child on her arm, a slight testiness scarcely concealed\nby respectful good-manners. She was a matron with a temper, and that a\nMount Dunstan should avoid responsibilities seemed highly credible.\n\n\"I shall stay where I am,\" Mount Dunstan answered. \"My place is here.\"\n\nThey believed him, Mount Dunstan though he was. It could not be said\nthat they were fond of him, but gradually it had been borne in upon them\nthat his word was to be relied on, though his manner was unalluring and\nthey knew he was too poor to do his duty by them or his estate. As\nhe walked away with the vicar, windows were opened, and in one or two\nuntidy cottages a sudden flourishing of mops and brooms began.\n\nThere was dark trouble in Mount Dunstan's face. In the huts they had\nleft two men stiff on their straw, and two women and a child in a state\nof collapse. Added to these were others stricken helpless. A number of\nworkers in the hop gardens, on realising the danger threatening them,\nhad gathered together bundles and children, and, leaving the harvest\nbehind, had gone on the tramp again. Those who remained were the weaker\nor less cautious, or were held by some tie to those who were already\nill of the fever. The village doctor was an old man who had spent his\nblameless life in bringing little cottagers into the world, attending\ntheir measles and whooping coughs, and their father's and grandfather's\nrheumatics. He had never faced a village crisis in the course of his\nseventy-five years, and was aghast and flurried with fright. His methods\nremained those of his youth, and were marked chiefly by a readiness\nto prescribe calomel in any emergency. A younger and stronger man was\nneeded, as well as a man of more modern training. But even the most\nbrilliant practitioner of the hour could not have provided shelter and\nnourishment, and without them his skill would have counted as nothing.\nFor three weeks there had been no rain, which was a condition of the\nbarometer not likely to last. Already grey clouds were gathering and\nobscuring the blueness of the sky.\n\nThe vicar glanced upwards anxiously.\n\n\"When it comes,\" he said, \"there will be a downpour, and a persistent\none.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Mount Dunstan answered.\n\nHe had lain awake thinking throughout the night. How was a man to sleep!\nIt was as Betty Vanderpoel had known it would be. He, who--beggar though\nhe might be--was the lord of the land, was the man to face the strait of\nthese poor workers on the land, as his own. Some action must be taken.\nWhat action? As he walked by his friend's side from the huts where the\ndead men lay it revealed itself that he saw his way.\n\nThey were going to the vicarage to consult a medical book, but on the\nway there they passed a part of the park where, through a break in the\ntimber the huge, white, blind-faced house stood on view. Mount Dunstan\nlaid his hand on Mr. Penzance's shoulder and stopped him,\n\n\"Look there!\" he said. \"THERE are weather-tight rooms enough.\"\n\nA startled expression showed itself on the vicar's face.\n\n\"For what?\" he exclaimed\n\n\"For a hospital,\" brusquely \"I can give them one thing, at\nleast--shelter.\"\n\n\"It is a very remarkable thing to think of doing,\" Mr. Penzance said.\n\n\"It is not so remarkable as that labourers on my land should die at my\ngate because I cannot give them decent roofs to cover them. There is a\nroof that will shield them from the weather. They shall be brought to\nthe Mount.\"\n\nThe vicar was silent a moment, and a flush of sympathy warmed his face.\n\n\"You are quite right, Fergus,\" he said, \"entirely right.\"\n\n\"Let us go to your study and plan how it shall be done,\" Mount Dunstan\nsaid.\n\nAs they walked towards the vicarage, he went on talking.\n\n\"When I lie awake at night, there is one thread which always winds\nitself through my thoughts whatsoever they are. I don't find that I can\ndisentangle it. It connects itself with Reuben S. Vanderpoel's daughter.\nYou would know that without my telling you. If you had ever struggled\nwith an insane passion----\"\n\n\"It is not insane, I repeat,\" put in Penzance unflinchingly.\n\n\"Thank you--whether you are right or wrong,\" answered Mount Dunstan,\nstriding by his side. \"When I am awake, she is as much a part of my\nexistence as my breath itself. When I think things over, I find that I\nam asking myself if her thoughts would be like mine. She is a creature\nof action. Last night, as I lay awake, I said to myself, 'She would DO\nsomething. What would she do?' She would not be held back by fear of\ncomment or convention. She would look about her for the utilisable, and\nshe would find it somewhere and use it. I began to sum up the village\nresources and found nothing--until my thoughts led me to my own house.\nThere it stood--empty and useless. If it were hers, and she stood in my\nplace, she would make it useful. So I decided.\"\n\n\"You are quite right,\" Mr. Penzance said again.\n\nThey spent an hour in his library at the vicarage, arranging practical\nmethods for transforming the great ballroom into a sort of hospital\nward. It could be done by the removal of pieces of furniture from the\nmany unused bedrooms. There was also the transportation of the patients\nfrom the huts to be provided for. But, when all this was planned out,\neach found himself looking at the other with an unspoken thought in his\nmind. Mount Dunstan first expressed it.\n\n\"As far as I can gather, the safety of typhoid fever patients depends\nalmost entirely on scientific nursing, and the caution with which even\nliquid nourishment is given. The woman whose husband died this morning\ntold me that he had seemed better in the night, and had asked for\nsomething to eat. She gave him a piece of bread and a slice of cold\nbacon, because he told her he fancied it. I could not explain to her, as\nshe sat sobbing over him, that she had probably killed him. When we have\npatients in our ward, what shall we feed them on, and who will know how\nto nurse them? They do not know how to nurse each other, and the women\nin the village would not run the risk of undertaking to help us.\"\n\nBut, even before he had left the house, the problem was solved for them.\nThe solving of it lay in the note Miss Vanderpoel had written the night\nbefore at Stornham.\n\nWhen it was brought to him Mr. Penzance glanced up from certain\ncalculations he was making upon a sheet of note-paper. The accumulating\ndifficulties made him look worn and tired. He opened the note and read\nit gravely, and then as gravely, though with a change of expression,\nhanded it to Mount Dunstan.\n\n\"Yes, she is a creature of action. She has heard and understood at\nonce, and she has done something. It is immensely practical--it is\nfine--it--it is lovable.\"\n\n\"Do you mind my keeping it?\" Mount Dunstan asked, after he had read it.\n\n\"Keep it by all means,\" the vicar answered. \"It is worth keeping.\"\n\nBut it was quite brief. She had heard of the outbreak of fever among the\nhop pickers, and asked to be allowed to give help to the people who were\nsuffering. They would need prompt aid. She chanced to know something of\nthe requirements of such cases, and had written to London for certain\nsupplies which would be sent to them at once. She had also written for\nnurses, who would be needed above all else. Might she ask Mr. Penzance\nto kindly call upon her for any further assistance required.\n\n\"Tell her we are deeply grateful,\" said Mount Dunstan, \"and that she has\ngiven us greater help than she knows.\"\n\n\"Why not answer her note yourself?\" Penzance suggested.\n\nMount Dunstan shook his head.\n\n\"No,\" he said shortly. \"No.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII\n\nIN THE BALLROOM\n\nThough Dunstan village was cut off, by its misfortune, from its usual\nintercourse with its neighbours, in some mystic manner villages even at\ntwenty miles' distance learned all it did and suffered, feared or hoped.\nIt did not hope greatly, the rustic habit of mind tending towards a\ndiscouraged outlook, and cherishing the drama of impending calamity.\nAs far as Yangford and Marling inmates of cottages and farmhouses were\ninclined to think it probable that Dunstan would be \"swep away,\"\nand rumours of spreading death and disaster were popular. Tread, the\nadvanced blacksmith at Stornham, having heard in his by-gone, better\ndays of the Great Plague of London, was greatly in demand as a narrator\nof illuminating anecdotes at The Clock Inn.\n\nAmong the parties gathered at the large houses Mount Dunstan himself\nwas much talked of. If he had been a popular man, he might have become\na sort of hero; as he was not popular, he was merely a subject for\ndiscussion. The fever-stricken patients had been carried in carts to\nthe Mount and given beds in the ballroom, which had been made into a\ntemporary ward. Nurses and supplies had been sent for from London, and\ntwo energetic young doctors had taken the place of old Dr. Fenwick, who\nhad been frightened and overworked into an attack of bronchitis which\nconfined him to his bed. Where the money came from, which must be spent\nevery day under such circumstances, it was difficult to say. To the\nsimply conservative of mind, the idea of filling one's house with dirty\nEast End hop pickers infected with typhoid seemed too radical. Surely\nhe could have done something less extraordinary. Would everybody\nbe expected to turn their houses into hospitals in case of village\nepidemics, now that he had established a precedent? But there were\npeople who approved, and were warm in their sympathy with him. At the\nfirst dinner party where the matter was made the subject of argument,\nthe beautiful Miss Vanderpoel, who was present, listened silently to the\ntalk with such brilliant eyes that Lord Dunholm, who was in an elderly\nway her staunch admirer, spoke to her across the table:\n\n\"Tell us what YOU think of it, Miss Vanderpoel,\" he suggested.\n\nShe did not hesitate at all.\n\n\"I like it,\" she answered, in her clear, well-heard voice. \"I like it\nbetter than anything I have ever heard.\"\n\n\"So do I,\" said old Lady Alanby shortly. \"I should never have done it\nmyself--but I like it just as you do.\"\n\n\"I knew you would, Lady Alanby,\" said the girl. \"And you, too, Lord\nDunholm.\"\n\n\n\"I like it so much that I shall write and ask if I cannot be of\nassistance,\" Lord Dunholm answered.\n\nBetty was glad to hear this. Only quickness of thought prevented her\nfrom the error of saying, \"Thank you,\" as if the matter were personal to\nherself. If Mount Dunstan was restive under the obviousness of the fact\nthat help was so sorely needed, he might feel less so if her offer was\nonly one among others.\n\n\"It seems rather the duty of the neighbourhood to show some interest,\"\nput in Lady Alanby. \"I shall write to him myself. He is evidently of\na new order of Mount Dunstan. It's to be hoped he won't take the fever\nhimself, and die of it He ought to marry some handsome, well-behaved\ngirl, and re-found the family.\"\n\nNigel Anstruthers spoke from his side of the table, leaning slightly\nforward.\n\n\"He won't if he does not take better care of himself. He passed me\non the road two days ago, riding like a lunatic. He looks frightfully\nill--yellow and drawn and lined. He has not lived the life to prepare\nhim for settling down to a fight with typhoid fever. He would be done\nfor if he caught the infection.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said Lord Dunholm, with quiet decision.\n\"Unprejudiced inquiry proves that his life has been entirely\nrespectable. As Lady Alanby says, he seems to be of a new order of Mount\nDunstan.\"\n\n\"No doubt you are right,\" said Sir Nigel suavely. \"He looked ill,\nnotwithstanding.\"\n\n\"As to looking ill,\" remarked Lady Alanby to Lord Dunholm, who sat\nnear her, \"that man looks as if he was going to pieces pretty rapidly\nhimself, and unprejudiced inquiry would not prove that his past had\nnothing to do with it.\"\n\nBetty wondered if her brother-in-law were lying. It was generally safest\nto argue that he was. But the fever burned high at Mount Dunstan, and\nshe knew by instinct what its owner was giving of the strength of his\nbody and brain. A young, unmarried woman cannot go about, however,\nmaking anxious inquiries concerning the welfare of a man who has made no\nadvance towards her. She must wait for the chance which brings news.\n\n. . . . .\n\nThe fever, having ill-cared for and habitually ill fed bodies to work\nupon, wrought fiercely, despite the energy of the two young doctors and\nthe trained nurses. There were many dark hours in the ballroom ward,\nhours filled with groans and wild ravings. The floating Terpsichorean\ngoddesses upon the lofty ceiling gazed down with wondering eyes at\nhaggard faces and plucking hands which sometimes, behind the screen\ndrawn round their beds, ceased to look feverish, and grew paler and\nstiller, until they moved no more. But, at least, none had died through\nwant of shelter and care. The supplies needed came from London each day.\nLord Dunholm had sent a generous cheque to the aid of the sufferers, and\nso, also, had old Lady Alanby, but Miss Vanderpoel, consulting medical\nauthorities and hospitals, learned exactly what was required, and\nnecessities were forwarded daily in their most easily utilisable form.\n\n\"You generously told me to ask you for anything we found we required,\"\nMr. Penzance wrote to her in his note of thanks. \"My dear and kind\nyoung lady, you leave nothing to ask for. Our doctors, who are young\nand enthusiastic, are filled with delight in the completeness of the\nresources placed in their hands.\"\n\nShe had, in fact, gone to London to consult an eminent physician, who\nwas an authority of world-wide reputation. Like the head of the legal\nfirm of Townlinson & Sheppard, he had experienced a new sensation in\nthe visit paid him by an indubitably modern young beauty, who wasted no\nword, and whose eyes, while he answered her amazingly clear questions,\nwere as intelligently intent as those of an ardent and serious young\nmedical student. What a surgical nurse she would have made! It seemed\nalmost a pity that she evidently belonged to a class the members of\nwhich are rich enough to undertake the charge of entire epidemics, but\nwho do not usually give themselves to such work, especially when they\nare young and astonishing in the matter of looks.\n\nIn addition to the work they did in the ballroom ward, Mount Dunstan\nand the vicar found much to do among the villagers. Ignorance and alarm\ncombined to create dangers, even where they might not have been feared.\nDaily instruction and inspection of the cottages and their inmates was\nrequired. The knowledge that they were under control and supervision\nwas a support to the frightened people and prevented their lapsing\ninto careless habits. Also, there began to develop among them a secret\ndependence upon, and desire to please \"his lordship,\" as the existing\ncircumstances drew him nearer to them, and unconsciously they were\nattracted and dominated by his strength. The strong man carries his\npower with him, and, when Mount Dunstan entered a cottage and talked to\nits inmates, the anxious wife or surlily depressed husband was conscious\nof feeling a certain sense of security. It had been a queer enough\nthing, this he had done--bundling the infected hoppers out of their\nleaking huts and carrying them up to the Mount itself for shelter\nand care. At the most, gentlefolk generally gave soup or blankets or\nhospital tickets, and left the rest to luck, but, \"gentry-way\" or not,\na man who did a thing like that would be likely to do other things, if\nthey were needed, and gave folk a feeling of being safer than ordinary\nsoup and blankets and hospital tickets could make them.\n\nBut \"where did the money come from?\" was asked during the first days.\nBeds and doctors, nurses and medicine, fine brandy and unlimited fowls\nfor broth did not come up from London without being paid for. Pounds\nand pounds a day must be paid out to get the things that were delivered\n\"regular\" in hampers and boxes. The women talked to one another over\ntheir garden palings, the men argued together over their beer at the\npublic house. Was he running into more debt? But even the village knew\nthat Mount Dunstan credit had been exhausted long ago, and there had\nbeen no money at the Mount within the memory of man, so to speak.\n\nOne morning the matron with the sharp temper found out the truth,\nthough the outburst of gratitude to Mount Dunstan which resulted in her\nenlightenment, was entirely spontaneous and without intention. Her doubt\nof his Mount Dunstan blood had grown into a sturdy liking even for his\nshort speech and his often drawn-down brows.\n\n\"We've got more to thank your lordship for than common help,\" she said.\n\"God Almighty knows where we'd all ha' been but for what you've done.\nThose poor souls you've nursed and fed----\"\n\n\"I've not done it,\" he broke in promptly. \"You're mistaken; I could not\nhave done it. How could I?\"\n\n\"Well,\" exclaimed the matron frankly, \"we WAS wondering where things\ncame from.\"\n\n\"You might well wonder. Have any of you seen Lady Anstruthers' sister,\nMiss Vanderpoel, ride through the village? She used sometimes to ride\nthis way. If you saw her you will remember it.'\n\n\"The 'Merican young lady!\" in ejaculatory delight. \"My word, yes! A\nfine young woman with black hair? That rich, they say, as millions won't\ncover it.\"\n\n\"They won't,\" grimly. \"Lord Dunholm and Lady Alanby of Dole kindly sent\ncheques to help us, but the American young lady was first on the field.\nShe sent both doctors and nurses, and has supplied us with food and\nmedicine every day. As you say, Mrs. Brown, God Almighty knows what\nwould have become of us, but for what she has done.\"\n\nMrs. Brown had listened with rather open mouth. She caught her breath\nheartily, as a sort of approving exclamation.\n\n\"God bless her!\" she broke out. \"Girls isn't generally like that. Their\nheads is too full of finery. God bless her, 'Merican or no 'Merican!\nThat's what I say.\"\n\nMount Dunstan's red-brown eyes looked as if she had pleased him.\n\n\"That's what I say, too,\" he answered. \"God bless her!\"\n\nThere was not a day which passed in which he did not involuntarily say\nthe words to himself again and again. She had been wrong when she had\nsaid in her musings that they were as far apart as if worlds rolled\nbetween them. Something stronger than sight or speech drew them\ntogether. The thread which wove itself through his thoughts grew\nstronger and stronger. The first day her gifts arrived and he walked\nabout the ballroom ward directing the placing of hospital cots and\nhospital aids and comforts, the spirit of her thought and intelligence,\nthe individuality and cleverness of all her methods, brought her so\nvividly before him that it was almost as if she walked by his side,\nas if they spoke together, as if she said, \"I have tried to think of\neverything. I want you to miss nothing. Have I helped you? Tell me if\nthere is anything more.\" The thing which moved and stirred him was his\nknowledge that when he had thought of her she had also been thinking\nof him, or of what deeply concerned him. When he had said to himself,\ntossing on his pillow, \"What would she DO?\" she had been planning\nin such a way as answered his question. Each morning, when the day's\nsupplies arrived, it was as if he had received a message from her.\n\nAs the people in the cottages felt the power of his temperament and\ndepended upon him, so, also, did the patients in the ballroom ward. The\nfeeling had existed from the outset and increased daily. The doctors and\nnurses told one another that his passing through the room was like the\nadministering of a tonic. Patients who were weak and making no effort,\nwere lifted upon the strong wave of his will and carried onward towards\nthe shore of greater courage and strength.\n\nYoung Doctor Thwaite met him when he came in one morning, and spoke in a\nlow voice:\n\n\"There is a young man behind the screen there who is very low,\" he said.\n\"He had an internal haemorrhage towards morning, and has lost his pluck.\nHe has a wife and three children. We have been doing our best for him\nwith hot-water bottles and stimulants, but he has not the courage\nto help us. You have an extraordinary effect on them all, Lord Mount\nDunstan. When they are depressed, they always ask when you are coming\nin, and this man--Patton, his name is--has asked for you several times.\nUpon my word, I believe you might set him going again.\"\n\nMount Dunstan walked to the bed, and, going behind the screen, stood\nlooking down at the young fellow lying breathing pantingly. His\neyes were closed as he laboured, and his pinched white nostrils drew\nthemselves in and puffed out at each breath. A nurse on the other side\nof the cot had just surrounded him with fresh hot-water bottles.\n\nSuddenly the sunken eyelids flew open, and the eyes met Mount Dunstan's\nin imploring anxiousness.\n\n\"Here I am, Patton,\" Mount Dunstan said. \"You need not speak.\"\n\nBut he must speak. Here was the strength his sinking soul had longed\nfor.\n\n\"Cruel bad--goin' fast--m' lord,\" he panted.\n\nMount Dunstan made a sign to the nurse, who gave him a chair. He sat\ndown close to the bed, and took the bloodless hand in his own.\n\n\"No,\" he said, \"you are not going. You'll stay here. I will see to\nthat.\"\n\nThe poor fellow smiled wanly. Vague yearnings had led him sometimes, in\nthe past, to wander into chapels or stop and listen to street preachers,\nand orthodox platitudes came back to him.\n\n\"God's--will,\" he trailed out.\n\n\"It's nothing of the sort. It's God's will that you pull yourself\ntogether. A man with a wife and three children has no right to slip\nout.\"\n\nA yearning look flickered in the lad's eyes--he was scarcely more than a\nlad, having married at seventeen, and had a child each year.\n\n\"She's--a good--girl.\"\n\n\"Keep that in your mind while you fight this out,\" said Mount Dunstan.\n\"Say it over to yourself each time you feel yourself letting go. Hold\non to it. I am going to fight it out with you. I shall sit here and take\ncare of you all day--all night, if necessary. The doctor and the nurse\nwill tell me what to do. Your hand is warmer already. Shut your eyes.\"\n\nHe did not leave the bedside until the middle of the night.\n\nBy that time the worst was over. He had acted throughout the hours under\nthe direction of nurse and doctor. No one but himself had touched the\npatient. When Patton's eyes were open, they rested on him with a weird\ngrowing belief. He begged his lordship to hold his hand, and was uneasy\nwhen he laid it down.\n\n\"Keeps--me--up,\" he whispered.\n\n\"He pours something into them--vigour--magnetic power--life. He's like\na charged battery,\" Dr. Thwaite said to his co-workers. \"He sat down by\nPatton just in time. It sets one to thinking.\"\n\nHaving saved Patton, he must save others. When a man or woman sank, or\nhad increased fever, they believed that he alone could give them help.\nIn delirium patients cried out for him. He found himself doing hard\nwork, but he did not flinch from it. The adoration for him became a\nsort of passion. Haggard faces lighted up into life at the sound of his\nfootstep, and heavy heads turned longingly on their pillows as he passed\nby. In the winter days to come there would be many an hour's talk in\nEast End courts and alleys of the queer time when a score or more of\nthem had lain in the great room with the dancing and floating goddesses\nlooking down at them from the high, painted ceiling, and the swell, who\nwas a lord, walking about among them, working for them as the nurses\ndid, and sitting by some of them through awful hours, sometimes holding\nburning or slackening and chilling hands with a grip whose steadiness\nseemed to hold them back from the brink of the abyss they were slipping\ninto. The mere ignorantly childish desire to do his prowess credit and\nto play him fair saved more than one man and woman from going out with\nthe tide.\n\n\"It is the first time in my life that I have fairly counted among men.\nIt's the first time I have known human affection, other than yours,\nPenzance. They want me, these people; they are better for the sight of\nme. It is a new experience, and it is good for a man's soul,\" he said.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII\n\nHIS CHANCE\n\nBetty walked much alone upon the marshes with Roland at her side. At\nintervals she heard from Mr. Penzance, but his notes were necessarily\nbrief, and at other times she could only rely upon report for news\nof what was occurring at Mount Dunstan. Lord Mount Dunstan's almost\nmilitary supervision of and command over his villagers had certainly\nsaved them from the horrors of an uncontrollable epidemic; his decision\nand energy had filled the alarmed Guardians with respect and this\nrespect had begun to be shared by many other persons. A man as prompt in\naction, and as faithful to such responsibilities as many men might\nhave found plausible reasons enough for shirking, inevitably assumed a\ncertain dignity of aspect, when all was said and done. Lord Dunholm was\nmost clear in his expressions of opinion concerning him. Lady Alanby\nof Dole made a practice of speaking of him in public frequently, always\nwith admiring approval, and in that final manner of hers, to whose\nauthority her neighbours had so long submitted. It began to be accepted\nas a fact that he was a new development of his race--as her ladyship had\nput it, \"A new order of Mount Dunstan.\"\n\nThe story of his power over the stricken people, and of their passionate\naffection and admiration for him, was one likely to spread far, and be\nimmensely popular. The drama of certain incidents appealed greatly\nto the rustic mind, and by cottage firesides he was represented with\nrapturous awe, as raising men, women, and children from the dead, by the\nmere miracle of touch. Mrs. Welden and old Doby revelled in thrilling,\nalmost Biblical, versions of current anecdotes, when Betty paid her\nvisits to them.\n\n\"It's like the Scripture, wot he done for that young man as the last\nbreath had gone out of him, an' him lyin' stiffening fast. 'Young man,\narise,' he says. 'The Lord Almighty calls. You've got a young wife an'\nthree children to take care of. Take up your bed an' walk.' Not as he\nwanted him to carry his bed anywheres, but it was a manner of speaking.\nAn' up the young man got. An' a sensible way,\" said old Mrs. Welden\nfrankly, \"for the Lord to look at it--for I must say, miss, if I was\nstruck down for it, though I s'pose it's only my sinful ignorance--that\nthere's times when the Lord seems to think no more of sweepin' away a\nsteady eighteen-shillin' a week, and p'raps seven in family, an' one at\nthe breast, an' another on the way--than if it was nothin'. But likely\nenough, eighteen shillin' a week an' confinements does seem paltry to\nthe Maker of 'eaven an' earth.\"\n\nBut, to the girl walking over the marshland, the humanness of the things\nshe heard gave to her the sense of nearness--of being almost within\nsight and sound--which Mount Dunstan himself had felt, when each day\nwas filled with the result of her thought of the needs of the poor souls\nthrown by fate into his hands. In these days, after listening to old\nMrs. Welden's anecdotes, through which she gathered the simpler truth\nof things, Betty was able to construct for herself a less Scriptural\nversion of what she had heard. She was glad--glad in his sitting by\na bedside and holding a hand which lay in his hot or cold, but always\ntrusting to something which his strong body and strong soul gave without\nstint. There would be no restraint there. Yes, he was kind--kind--kind\n--with the kindness a woman loves, and which she, of all women, loved\nmost. Sometimes she would sit upon some mound, and, while her eyes\nseemed to rest on the yellowing marsh and its birds and pools, they saw\nother things, and their colour grew deep and dark as the marsh water\nbetween the rushes.\n\nThe time was pressing when a change in her life must come. She\nfrequently asked herself if what she saw in Nigel Anstruthers' face was\nthe normal thinking of a sane man, which he himself could control. There\nhad been moments when she had seriously doubted it. He was haggard,\naging and restless. Sometimes he--always as if by chance--followed her\nas she went from one room to another, and would seat himself and fix\nhis miserable eyes upon her for so long a time that it seemed he must\nbe unconscious of what he was doing. Then he would appear suddenly to\nrecollect himself and would start up with a muttered exclamation, and\nstalk out of the room. He spent long hours riding or driving alone about\nthe country or wandering wretchedly through the Park and gardens. Once\nhe went up to town, and, after a few days' absence, came back looking\nmore haggard than before, and wearing a hunted look in his eyes. He had\ngone to see a physician, and, after having seen him, he had tried to\nlose himself in a plunge into deep and turbid enough waters; but he\nfound that he had even lost the taste of high flavours, for which he\nhad once had an epicurean palate. The effort had ended in his being\noverpowered again by his horrors--the horrors in which he found himself\nstaring at that end of things when no pleasure had spice, no debauchery\nthe sting of life, and men, such as he, stood upon the shore of time\nshuddering and naked souls, watching the great tide, bearing its\ntreasures, recede forever, and leave them to the cold and hideous dark.\nDuring one day of his stay in town he had seen Teresita, who had at\nfirst stared half frightened by the change she saw in him, and then had\ntold him truths he could have wrung her neck for putting into words.\n\n\"You look an old man,\" she said, with the foreign accent he had once\nfound deliciously amusing, but which now seemed to add a sting. \"And\nsomesing is eating you op. You are mad in lofe with some beautiful one\nwho will not look at you. I haf seen it in mans before. It is she who\neats you op--your evil thinkings of her. It serve you right. Your eyes\nlook mad.\"\n\nHe himself, at times, suspected that they did, and cursed himself\nbecause he could not keep cool. It was part of his horrors that he knew\nhis internal furies were worse than folly, and yet he could not restrain\nthem. The creeping suspicion that this was only the result of the simple\nfact that he had never tried to restrain any tendency of his own was\nmaddening. His nervous system was a wreck. He drank a great deal of\nwhisky to keep himself \"straight\" during the day, and he rose many times\nduring his black waking hours in the night to drink more because he\nobstinately refused to give up the hope that, if he drank enough, it\nwould make him sleep. As through the thoughts of Mount Dunstan, who was\na clean and healthy human being, there ran one thread which would not\ndisentangle itself, so there ran through his unwholesome thinking a\nthread which burned like fire. His secret ravings would not have been\ngood to hear. His passion was more than half hatred, and a desire for\nvengeance, for the chance to re-assert his own power, to prove himself\nmaster, to get the better in one way or another of this arrogant young\noutsider and her high-handed pride. The condition of his mind was so far\nfrom normal that he failed to see that the things he said to himself,\nthe plans he laid, were grotesque in their folly. The old cruel\ndominance of the man over the woman thing, which had seemed the mere\nnatural working of the law among men of his race in centuries past, was\nawake in him, amid the limitations of modern days.\n\n\"My God,\" he said to himself more than once, \"I would like to have\nhad her in my hands a few hundred years ago. Women were kept in their\nplaces, then.\"\n\nHe was even frenzied enough to think over what he would have done, if\nsuch a thing had been--of her utter helplessness against that which\nraged in him--of the grey thickness of the walls where he might\nhave held and wrought his will upon her--insult, torment, death. His\nalcohol-excited brain ran riot--but, when it did its foolish worst, he\nwas baffled by one thing.\n\n\"Damn her!\" he found himself crying out. \"If I had hung her up and\ncut her into strips she would have died staring at me with her big\neyes--without uttering a sound.\"\n\nThere was a long reach between his imaginings and the time he lived\nin. America had not been discovered in those decent days, and now a\nman could not beat even his own wife, or spend her money, without being\nmeddled with by fools. He was thinking of a New York young woman of the\nnineteenth century who could actually do as she hanged pleased, and who\npleased to be damned high and mighty. For that reason in itself it was\nincumbent upon a man to get even with her in one way or another. High\nand mightiness was not the hardest thing to reach. It offered a good\naim.\n\nHis temper when he returned to Stornham was of the order which in past\nyears had set Rosalie and her child shuddering and had sent the servants\nabout the house with pale or sullen faces. Betty's presence had the\nodd effect of restraining him, and he even told her so with sneering\nresentment.\n\n\"There would be the devil to pay if you were not here,\" he said. \"You\nkeep me in order, by Jove! I can't work up steam properly when you watch\nme.\"\n\nHe himself knew that it was likely that some change would take place.\nShe would not stay at Stornham and she would not leave his wife and\nchild alone with him again. It would be like her to hold her tongue\nuntil she was ready with her infernal plans and could spring them on\nhim. Her letters to her father had probably prepared him for such action\nas such a man would be likely to take. He could guess what it would be.\nThey were free and easy enough in America in their dealings with the\nmarriage tie. Their idea would doubtless be a divorce with custody of\nthe child. He wondered a little that they had remained quiet so long.\nThere had been American shrewdness in her coming boldly to Stornham to\nlook over the ground herself and actually set the place in order. It did\nnot present itself to his mind that what she had done had been no part\nof a scheme, but the mere result of her temperament and training. He\ntold himself that it had been planned beforehand and carried out in\nhard-headed commercial American fashion as a matter of business. The\nthing which most enraged him was the implied cool, practical realisation\nof the fact that he, as inheritor of an entailed estate, was but owner\nin charge, and not young enough to be regarded as an insurmountable\nobstacle to their plans. He could not undo the greater part of what had\nbeen done, and they were calculating, he argued, that his would not be\nlikely to be a long life, and if--if anything happened--Stornham would\nbe Ughtred's and the whole vulgar lot of them would come over and take\npossession and swagger about the place as if they had been born on it.\nAs to divorce or separation--if they took that line, he would at least\ngive them a good run for their money. They would wish they had let\nsleeping dogs lie before the thing was over. The right kind of lawyer\ncould bully Rosalie into saying anything he chose on the witness-stand.\nThere was not much limit to the evidence a man could bring if he was\nexperienced enough to be circumstantial, and knew whom he was dealing\nwith. The very fact that the little fool could be made to appear to have\nbeen so sly and sanctimonious would stir the gall of any jury of men.\nHis own condoning the matter for the sake of his sensitive boy, deformed\nby his mother's unrestrained and violent hysteria before his birth,\nwould go a long way. Let them get their divorce, they would have paid\nfor it, the whole lot of them, the beautiful Miss Vanderpoel and\nall. Such a story as the newspapers would revel in would not be\na recommendation to Englishmen of unsmirched reputation. Then his\nexultation would suddenly drop as his mental excitement produced its\neffect of inevitable physical fatigue. Even if he made them pay for\ngetting their own way, what would happen to himself afterwards? No\nmorbid vanity of self-bolstering could make the outlook anything\nbut unpromising. If he had not had such diabolical luck in his few\ninvestments he could have lived his own life. As it was, old Vanderpoel\nwould possibly condescend to make him some insufficient allowance\nbecause Rosalie would wish that it might be done, and he would be\nexpected to drag out to the end the kind of life a man pensioned by his\nwife's relatives inevitably does. If he attempted to live in the country\nhe should blow out his brains. When his depression was at its worst, he\nsaw himself aging and shabby, rambling about from one cheap Continental\ntown to another, blackballed by good clubs, cold-shouldered even by the\nTeresitas, cut off from society by his limited means and the stories\nhis wife's friends would spread. He ground his teeth when he thought\nof Betty. Her splendid vitality had done something to life for him--had\ngiven it savour. When he had come upon her in the avenue his blood had\nstirred, even though it had been maliciously, and there had been spice\nin his very resentment of her presence. And she would go away. He would\nnot be likely to see her again if his wife broke with him; she would be\nswept out of his days. It was hideous to think of, and his rage would\noverpower him and his nerves go to pieces again.\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" he broke forth suddenly one evening, when\nhe found himself temporarily alone with her. \"You are going to do\nsomething. I see it in your eyes.\"\n\nHe had been for some time watching her from behind his newspaper, while\nshe, with an unread book upon her lap, had, in fact, been thinking\ndeeply and putting to herself serious questions.\n\nHer answer made him stir rather uncomfortably.\n\n\"I am going to write to my father to ask him to come to England.\"\n\nSo this was what she had been preparing to spring upon him. He laughed\ninsolently.\n\n\"To ask him to come here?\"\n\n\"With your permission.\"\n\n\"With mine? Does an American father-in-law wait for permission?\"\n\n\"Is there any practical reason why you should prefer that he should NOT\ncome?\"\n\nHe left his seat and walked over to her.\n\n\"Yes. Your sending for him is a declaration of war.\"\n\n\"It need not be so. Why should it?\"\n\n\"In this case I happen to be aware that it is. The choice is your own, I\nsuppose,\" with ready bravado, \"that you and he are prepared to face the\nconsequences. But is Rosalie, and is your mother?\"\n\n\"My father is a business man and will know what can be done. He will\nknow what is worth doing,\" she answered, without noticing his\nquestion. \"But,\" she added the words slowly, \"I have been making up\nmy mind--before I write to him--to say something to you--to ask you a\nquestion.\"\n\nHe made a mock sentimental gesture.\n\n\"To ask me to spare my wife, to 'remember that she is the mother of my\nchild'?\"\n\nShe passed over that also.\n\n\"To ask you if there is no possible way in which all this unhappiness\ncan be ended decently.\"\n\n\"The only decent way of ending it would be that there should be no\nfurther interference. Let Rosalie supply the decency by showing me the\nconsideration due from a wife to her husband. The place has been put in\norder. It was not for my benefit, and I have no money to keep it up. Let\nRosalie be provided with means to do it.\"\n\nAs he spoke the words he realised that he had opened a way for\nembarrassing comment. He expected her to remind him that Rosalie had not\ncome to him without money. But she said nothing about the matter. She\nnever said the things he expected to hear.\n\n\"You do not want Rosalie for your wife,\" she went on \"but you could\ntreat her courteously without loving her. You could allow her the\nprivileges other men's wives are allowed. You need not separate her from\nher family. You could allow her father and mother to come to her and\nleave her free to go to them sometimes. Will you not agree to that? Will\nyou not let her live peaceably in her own simple way? She is very gentle\nand humble and would ask nothing more.\"\n\n\"She is a fool!\" he exclaimed furiously. \"A fool! She will stay where\nshe is and do as I tell her.\"\n\n\"You knew what she was when you married her. She was simple and girlish\nand pretended to be nothing she was not. You chose to marry her and take\nher from the people who loved her. You broke her spirit and her heart.\nYou would have killed her if I had not come in time to prevent it.\"\n\n\"I will kill her yet if you leave her,\" his folly made him say.\n\n\"You are talking like a feudal lord holding the power of life and death\nin his hands,\" she said. \"Power like that is ancient history. You can\nhurt no one who has friends--without being punished.\"\n\nIt was the old story. She filled him with the desire to shake or disturb\nher at any cost, and he did his utmost. If she was proposing to make\nterms with him, he would show her whether he would accept them or not.\nHe let her hear all he had said to himself in his worst moments--all\nthat he had argued concerning what she and her people would do, and\nwhat his own actions would be--all his intention to make them pay the\nuttermost farthing in humiliation if he could not frustrate them.\nHis methods would be definite enough. He had not watched his wife and\nFfolliott for weeks to no end. He had known what he was dealing with. He\nhad put other people upon the track and they would testify for him. He\npoured forth unspeakable statements and intimations, going, as usual,\nfurther than he had known he should go when he began. Under the spur of\nexcitement his imagination served him well. At last he paused.\n\n\"Well,\" he put it to her, \"what have you to say?\"\n\n\"I?\" with the remote intent curiosity growing in her eyes. \"I have\nnothing to say. I am leaving you to say things.\"\n\n\"You will, of course, try to deny----\" he insisted.\n\n\"No, I shall not. Why should I?\"\n\n\"You may assume your air of magnificence, but I am dealing with\nuncomfortable factors.\" He stopped in spite of himself, and then burst\nforth in a new order of rage. \"You are trying some confounded experiment\non me. What is it?\"\n\nShe rose from her chair to go out of the room, and stood a moment\nholding her book half open in her hand.\n\n\"Yes. I suppose it might be called an experiment,\" was her answer.\n\"Perhaps it was a mistake. I wanted to make quite sure of something.\"\n\n\"Of what?\"\n\n\"I did not want to leave anything undone. I did not want to believe that\nany man could exist who had not one touch of decent feeling to redeem\nhim. It did not seem human.\"\n\nWhite dints showed themselves about his nostrils.\n\n\"Well, you have found one,\" he cried. \"You have a lashing tongue, by\nGod, when you choose to let it go. But I could teach you a good many\nthings, my girl. And before I have done you will have learned most of\nthem.\"\n\nBut though he threw himself into a chair and laughed aloud as she left\nhim, he knew that his arrogance and bullying were proving poor weapons,\nthough they had done him good service all his life. And he knew, too,\nthat it was mere simple truth that, as a result of the intellectual,\nethical vagaries he scathingly derided--she had actually been giving him\na sort of chance to retrieve himself, and that if he had been another\nsort of man he might have taken it.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV\n\nA FOOTSTEP\n\nIt was cold enough for fires in halls and bedrooms, and Lady Anstruthers\noften sat over hers and watched the glowing bed of coals with a fixed\nthoughtfulness of look. She was so sitting when her sister went to\nher room to talk to her, and she looked up questioningly when the door\nclosed and Betty came towards her.\n\n\"You have come to tell me something,\" she said.\n\nA slight shade of anxiousness showed itself in her eyes, and Betty sat\ndown by her and took her hand. She had come because what she knew was\nthat Rosalie must be prepared for any step taken, and the time had\narrived when she must not be allowed to remain in ignorance even of\nthings it would be unpleasant to put into words.\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered. \"I want to talk to you about something I have\ndecided to do. I think I must write to father and ask him to come to\nus.\"\n\nRosalie turned white, but though her lips parted as if she were going to\nspeak, she said nothing.\n\n\"Do not be frightened,\" Betty said. \"I believe it is the only thing to\ndo.\"\n\n\"I know! I know!\"\n\nBetty went on, holding the hand a little closer. \"When I came here\nyou were too weak physically to be able to face even the thought of a\nstruggle. I saw that. I was afraid it must come in the end, but I knew\nthat at that time you could not bear it. It would have killed you\nand might have killed mother, if I had not waited; and until you\nwere stronger, I knew I must wait and reason coolly about you--about\neverything.\"\n\n\"I used to guess--sometimes,\" said Lady Anstruthers.\n\n\"I can tell you about it now. You are not as you were then,\" Betty said.\n\"I did not know Nigel at first, and I felt I ought to see more of him. I\nwanted to make sure that my child hatred of him did not make me unfair.\nI even tried to hope that when he came back and found the place in order\nand things going well, he might recognise the wisdom of behaving with\ndecent kindness to you. If he had done that I knew father would have\nprovided for you both, though he would not have left him the opportunity\nto do again what he did before. No business man would allow such a thing\nas that. But as time has gone by I have seen I was mistaken in hoping\nfor a respectable compromise. Even if he were given a free hand he would\nnot change. And now----\" She hesitated, feeling it difficult to choose\nsuch words as would not be too unpleasant. How was she to tell Rosy of\nthe ugly, morbid situation which made ordinary passiveness impossible.\n\"Now there is a reason----\" she began again.\n\nTo her surprise and relief it was Rosalie who ended for her. She spoke\nwith the painful courage which strong affection gives a weak thing. Her\nface was pale no longer, but slightly reddened, and she lifted the hand\nwhich held hers and kissed it.\n\n\"You shall not say it,\" she interrupted her. \"I will. There is a reason\nnow why you cannot stay here--why you shall not stay here. That was why\nI begged you to go. You must go, even if I stay behind alone.\"\n\nNever had the beautiful Miss Vanderpoel's eyes worn so fully their look\nof being bluebells under water. That this timid creature should so stand\nat bay to defend her was more moving than anything else could have been.\n\n\"Thank you, Rosy--thank you,\" she answered. \"But you shall not be left\nalone. You must go, too. There is no other way. Difficulties will be\nmade for us, but we must face them. Father will see the situation from\na practical man's standpoint. Men know the things other men cannot\ndo. Women don't. Generally they know nothing about the law and can be\nbullied into feeling that it is dangerous and compromising to inquire\ninto it. Nigel has always seen that it was easy to manage women. A\nstrong business man who has more exact legal information than he\nhas himself will be a new factor to deal with. And he cannot make\nobjectionable love to him. It is because he knows these things that he\nsays that my sending for father will be a declaration of war.\"\n\n\"Did he say that?\" a little breathlessly.\n\n\n\"Yes, and I told him that it need not be so. But he would not listen.\"\n\n\"And you are sure father will come?\"\n\n\"I am sure. In a week or two he will be here.\"\n\nLady Anstruthers' lips shook, her eyes lifted themselves to Betty's in\na touchingly distressed appeal. Had her momentary courage fled beyond\nrecall? If so, that would be the worst coming to the worst, indeed.\nYet it was not ordinary fear which expressed itself in her face, but a\ndeeper piteousness, a sudden hopeless pain, baffling because it seemed\na new emotion, or perhaps the upheaval of an old one long and carefully\nhidden.\n\n\"You will be brave?\" Betty appealed to her. \"You will not give way,\nRosy?\"\n\n\"Yes, I must be brave--I am not ill now. I must not fail you--I won't,\nBetty, but----\"\n\nShe slipped upon the floor and dropped her face upon the girl's knee,\nsobbing.\n\nBetty bent over her, putting her arms round the heaving shoulders,\nand pleading with her to speak. Was there something more to be told,\nsomething she did not know?\n\n\"Yes, yes. Oh, I ought to have told you long ago--but I have always been\nafraid and ashamed. It has made everything so much worse. I was afraid\nyou would not understand and would think me wicked--wicked.\"\n\nIt was Betty who now lost a shade of colour. But she held the slim\nlittle body closer and kissed her sister's cheek.\n\n\"What have you been afraid and ashamed to tell me? Do not be ashamed any\nmore. You must not hide anything, no matter what it is, Rosy. I shall\nunderstand.\"\n\n\"I know I must not hide anything, now that all is over and father is\ncoming. It is--it is about Mr. Ffolliott.\"\n\n\"Mr. Ffolliott?\" repeated Betty quite softly.\n\nLady Anstruthers' face, lifted with desperate effort, was like a weeping\nchild's. So much so in its tear-wet simpleness and utter lack of any\neffort at concealment, that after one quick look at it Betty's hastened\npulses ceased to beat at double-quick time.\n\n\"Tell me, dear,\" she almost whispered.\n\n\"Mr. Ffolliott himself does not know--and I could not help it. He was\nkind to me when I was dying of unkindness. You don't know what it was\nlike to be drowning in loneliness and misery, and to see one good hand\nstretched out to help you. Before he went away--oh, Betty, I know it was\nawful because I was married!--I began to care for him very much, and I\nhave cared for him ever since. I cannot stop myself caring, even though\nI am terrified.\"\n\nBetty kissed her again with a passion of tender pity. Poor little,\nsimple Rosy, too! The tide had crept around her also, and had swept\nher off her feet, tossing her upon its surf like a wisp of seaweed and\nbearing her each day farther from firm shore.\n\n\"Do not be terrified,\" she said. \"You need only be afraid if--if you had\ntold him.\"\n\n\"He will never know--never. Once in the middle of the night,\" there was\nanguish in the delicate face, pure anguish, \"a strange loud cry wakened\nme, and it was I myself who had cried out--because in my sleep it had\ncome home to me that the years would go on and on, and at last some day\nhe would die and go out of the world--and I should die and go out of the\nworld. And he would never know--even KNOW.\"\n\nBetty's clasp of her loosened and she sat very still, looking straight\nbefore her into some unseen place.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said involuntarily. \"Yes, _I_ know--I know--I know.\"\n\nLady Anstruthers fell back a little to gaze at her.\n\n\"YOU know? YOU know?\" she breathed. \"Betty?\"\n\nBut Betty at first did not speak. Her lovely eyes dwelt on the far-away\nplace.\n\n\"Betty,\" whispered Rosy, \"do you know what you have said?\"\n\nThe lovely eyes turned slowly towards her, and the soft corners of\nBetty's mouth deepened in a curious unsteadiness.\n\n\"Yes. I did not intend to say it. But it is true. _I_ know--I know--I\nknow. Do not ask me how.\"\n\nRosalie flung her arms round her waist and for a moment hid her face.\n\n\"YOU! YOU!\" she murmured, but stopped herself almost as she uttered the\nexclamation. \"I will not ask you,\" she said when she spoke again. \"But\nnow I shall not be so ashamed. You are a beauty and wonderful, and I am\nnot; but if you KNOW, that makes us almost the same. You will understand\nwhy I broke down. It was because I could not bear to think of what will\nhappen. I shall be saved and taken home, but Nigel will wreak revenge on\nHIM. And I shall be the shame that is put upon him--only because he was\nkind--KIND. When father comes it will all begin.\" She wrung her hands,\nbecoming almost hysterical.\n\n\"Hush,\" said Betty. \"Hush! A man like that CANNOT be hurt, even by a man\nlike Nigel. There is a way out--there IS. Oh, Rosy, we must BELIEVE it.\"\n\nShe soothed and caressed her and led her on to relieving her long\nlocked-up misery by speech. It was easy to see the ways in which her\nfeeling had made her life harder to bear. She was as inexperienced as a\ngirl, and had accused herself cruelly. When Nigel had tormented her with\nevil, carefully chosen taunts, she had felt half guilty and had coloured\nscarlet or turned pale, afraid to meet his sneeringly smiling face. She\nhad tried to forget the kind voice, the kindly, understanding eyes, and\nhad blamed herself as a criminal because she could not.\n\n\"I had nothing else to remember--but unhappiness--and it seemed as if I\ncould not help but remember HIM,\" she said as simply as the Rosy who\nhad left New York at nineteen might have said it. \"I was afraid to trust\nmyself to speak his name. When Nigel made insulting speeches I could\nnot answer him, and he used to say that women who had adventures should\ntrain their faces not to betray them every time they were looked at.\n\n\"Oh!\" broke from Betty's lips, and she stood up on the hearth and threw\nout her hands. \"I wish that for one day I might be a man--and your\nbrother instead of your sister!\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nBetty smiled strangely--a smile which was not amused--which was perhaps\nnot a smile at all. Her voice as she answered was at once low and tense.\n\n\"Because, then I should know what to do. When a male creature cannot be\nreached through manhood or decency or shame, there is one way in which\nhe can be punished. A man--a real man--should take him by his throat\nand lash him with a whip--while others look on--lash him until he howls\naloud like a dog.\"\n\nShe had not expected to say it, but she had said it. Lady Anstruthers\nlooked at her fascinated, and then she covered her face with her hands,\nhuddling herself in a heap as she knelt on the rug, looking singularly\nsmall and frail.\n\n\"Betty,\" she said presently, in a new, awful little voice, \"I--I will\ntell you something. I never thought I should dare to tell anyone alive.\nI have shuddered at it myself. There have been days--awful, helpless\ndays, when I was sure there was no hope for me in all the world--when\ndeep down in my soul I understood what women felt when they MURDERED\npeople--crept to them in their wicked sleep and STRUCK them again--and\nagain--and again. Like that!\" She sat up suddenly, as if she did not\nknow what she was doing, and uncovering her little ghastly face struck\ndownward three fierce times at nothingness--but as if it were not\nnothingness, and as if she held something in her hand.\n\nThere was horror in it--Betty sprang at the hand and caught it.\n\n\"No! no!\" she cried out. \"Poor little Rosy! Darling little Rosy! No! no!\nno!\"\n\nThat instant Lady Anstruthers looked up at her shocked and awake. She\nwas Rosy again, and clung to her, holding to her dress, piteous and\npanting.\n\n\"No! no!\" she said. \"When it came to me in the night--it was always in\nthe night--I used to get out of bed and pray that it might never, never\ncome again, and that I might be forgiven--just forgiven. It was too\nhorrible that I should even UNDERSTAND it so well.\" A woeful, wry little\nsmile twisted her mouth. \"I was not brave enough to have done it. I\ncould never have DONE it, Betty; but the thought was there--it was\nthere! I used to think it had made a black mark on my soul.\"\n\n. . . . .\n\nThe letter took long to write. It led a consecutive story up to the\npoint where it culminated in a situation which presented itself as no\nlonger to be dealt with by means at hand. Parts of the story previous\nletters had related, though some of them it had not seemed absolutely\nnecessary to relate in detail. Now they must be made clear, and Betty\nmade them so.\n\n\"Because you trusted me you made me trust myself,\" was one of the things\nshe wrote. \"For some time I felt that it was best to fight for my own\nhand without troubling you. I hoped perhaps I might be able to lead\nthings to a decorous sort of issue. I saw that secretly Rosy hoped and\nprayed that it might be possible. She gave up expecting happiness before\nshe was twenty, and mere decent peace would have seemed heaven to her,\nif she could have been allowed sometimes to see those she loved and\nlonged for. Now that I must give up my hope--which was perhaps a rather\nfoolish one--and now that I cannot remain at Stornham, she would have\nno defence at all if she were left alone. Her condition would be more\nhopeless than before, because Nigel would never forget that we had tried\nto rescue her and had failed. If I were a man, or if I were very much\nolder, I need not be actually driven away, but as it is I think that you\nmust come and take the matter into your own hands.\"\n\nShe had remained in her sister's room until long after midnight, and by\nthe time the American letter was completed and sealed, a pale touch of\ndawning light was showing itself. She rose, and going to the window drew\nthe blind up and looked out. The looking out made her open the window,\nand when she had done so she stood feeling the almost unearthly\nfreshness of the morning about her. The mystery of the first faint light\nwas almost unearthly, too. Trees and shrubs were beginning to take form\nand outline themselves against the still pallor of the dawn. Before long\nthe waking of the birds would begin--a brief chirping note here and\nthere breaking the silence and warning the world with faint insistence\nthat it had begun to live again and must bestir itself. She had got out\nof her bed sometimes on a summer morning to watch the beauty of it, to\nsee the flowers gradually reveal their colour to the eye, to hear the\nwarmly nesting things begin their joyous day. There were fewer bird\nsounds now, and the garden beds were autumnal. But how beautiful it all\nwas! How wonderful life in such a place might be if flowers and birds\nand sweep of sward, and mass of stately, broad-branched trees, were\nparts of the home one loved and which surely would in its own way love\none in return. But soon all this phase of life would be over. Rosalie,\nonce safe at home, would look back, remembering the place with a\nshudder. As Ughtred grew older the passing of years would dim miserable\nchild memories, and when his inheritance fell to him he might return to\nsee it with happier eyes. She began to picture to herself Rosy's voyage\nin the ship which would carry her across the Atlantic to her mother\nand the scenes connected in her mind only with a girl's happiness.\nWhatsoever happened before it took place, the voyage would be made in\nthe end. And Rosalie would be like a creature in a dream--a heavenly,\nunbelievable dream. Betty could imagine how she would look wrapped up\nand sitting in her steamer chair, gazing out with rapturous eyes upon\nthe racing waves.\n\n\"She will be happy,\" she thought. \"But I shall not. No, I shall not.\"\n\nShe drew in the morning air and unconsciously turned towards the place\nwhere, across the rising and falling lands and behind the trees, she\nknew the great white house stood far away, with watchers' lights showing\ndimly behind the line of ballroom windows.\n\n\"I do not know how such a thing could be! I do not know how such a thing\ncould be!\" she said. \"It COULD not.\" And she lifted a high head, not\neven asking herself what remote sense in her being so obstinately defied\nand threw down the glove to Fate.\n\nSounds gain a curious distinctness and meaning in the hour of the break\nof the dawn; in such an hour they seem even more significant than sounds\nheard in the dead of night. When she had gone to the window she had\nfancied that she heard something in the corridor outside her door, but\nwhen she had listened there had been only silence. Now there was sound\nagain--that of a softly moved slippered foot. She went to the room's\ncentre and waited. Yes, certainly something had stirred in the passage.\nShe went to the door itself. The dragging step had hesitated--stopped.\nCould it be Rosalie who had come to her for something. For one second\nher impulse was to open the door herself; the next, she had changed her\nmind with a sense of shock. Someone had actually touched the handle and\nvery delicately turned it. It was not pleasant to stand looking at it\nand see it turn. She heard a low, evidently unintentionally uttered\nexclamation, and she turned away, and with no attempt at softening\nthe sound of her footsteps walked across the room, hot with passionate\ndisgust. As well as if she had flung the door open, she knew who\nstood outside. It was Nigel Anstruthers, haggard and unseemly, with\nburned-out, sleepless eyes and bitten lip.\n\nBad and mad as she had at last seen the situation to be, it was uglier\nand more desperate than she could well know.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLV\n\nTHE PASSING BELL\n\nThe following morning Sir Nigel did not appear at the breakfast table.\nHe breakfasted in his own room, and it became known throughout the\nhousehold that he had suddenly decided to go away, and his man was\npacking for the journey. What the journey or the reason for its being\ntaken happened to be were things not explained to anyone but Lady\nAnstruthers, at the door of whose dressing room he appeared without\nwarning, just as she was leaving it.\n\nRosalie started when she found herself confronting him. His eyes looked\nhot and hollow with feverish sleeplessness.\n\n\"You look ill,\" she exclaimed involuntarily. \"You look as if you had not\nslept.\"\n\n\"Thank you. You always encourage a man. I am not in the habit of\nsleeping much,\" he answered. \"I am going away for my health. It is as\nwell you should know. I am going to look up old Broadmorlands. I want\nto know exactly where he is, in case it becomes necessary for me to see\nhim. I also require some trifling data connected with Ffolliott. If\nyour father is coming, it will be as well to be able to lay my hands on\nthings. You can explain to Betty. Good-morning.\" He waited for no reply,\nbut wheeled about and left her.\n\nBetty herself wore a changed face when she came down. A cloud had passed\nover her blooming, as clouds pass over a morning sky and dim it. Rosalie\nasked herself if she had not noticed something like this before. She\nbegan to think she had. Yes, she was sure that at intervals there had\nbeen moments when she had glanced at the brilliant face with an uneasy\nand yet half-unrealising sense of looking at a glowing light temporarily\nwaning. The feeling had been unrealisable, because it was not to be\nexplained. Betty was never ill, she was never low-spirited, she\nwas never out of humour or afraid of things--that was why it was so\nwonderful to live with her. But--yes, it was true--there had been\ndays when the strong, fine light of her had waned. Lady Anstruthers'\ncomprehension of it arose now from her memory of the look she had seen\nthe night before in the eyes which suddenly had gazed straight before\nher, as into an unknown place.\n\n\"Yes, I know--I know--I know!\" And the tone in the girl's voice had been\none Rosy had not heard before.\n\nSlight wonder--if you KNEW--at any outward change which showed itself,\nthough in your own most desperate despite. It would be so even with\nBetty, who, in her sister's eyes, was unlike any other creature. But\nperhaps it would be better to make no comment. To make comment would be\nalmost like asking the question she had been forbidden to ask.\n\nWhile the servants were in the room during breakfast they talked\nof common things, resorting even to the weather and the news of the\nvillage. Afterwards they passed into the morning room together, and\nBetty put her arm around Rosalie and kissed her.\n\n\"Nigel has suddenly gone away, I hear,\" she said. \"Do you know where he\nhas gone?\"\n\n\"He came to my dressing-room to tell me.\" Betty felt the whole slim body\nstiffen itself with a determination to seem calm. \"He said he was going\nto find out where the old Duke of Broadmorlands was staying at present.\"\n\n\"There is some forethought in that,\" was Betty's answer. \"He is not on\nsuch terms with the Duke that he can expect to be received as a casual\nvisitor. It will require apt contrivance to arrange an interview. I\nwonder if he will be able to accomplish it?\"\n\n\"Yes, he will,\" said Lady Anstruthers. \"I think he can always contrive\nthings like that.\" She hesitated a moment, and then added: \"He said also\nthat he wished to find out certain things about Mr. Ffolliott--'trifling\ndata,' he called it--that he might be able to lay his hands on things if\nfather came. He told me to explain to you.\"\n\n\"That was intended for a taunt--but it's a warning,\" Betty said,\nthinking the thing over. \"We are rather like ladies left alone to\ndefend a besieged castle. He wished us to feel that.\" She tightened her\nenclosing arm. \"But we stand together--together. We shall not fail each\nother. We can face siege until father comes.\"\n\n\"You wrote to him last night?\"\n\n\"A long letter, which I wish him to receive before he sails. He might\ndecide to act upon it before leaving New York, to advise with some legal\nauthority he knows and trusts, to prepare our mother in some way--to do\nsome wise thing we cannot foresee the value of. He has known the outline\nof the story, but not exact details--particularly recent ones. I have\nheld back nothing it was necessary he should know. I am going out to\npost the letter myself. I shall send a cable asking him to prepare to\ncome to us after he has reflected on what I have written.\"\n\nRosalie was very quiet, but when, having left the room to prepare to go\nto the village, Betty came back to say a last word, her sister came to\nher and laid her hand on her arm.\n\n\"I have been so weak and trodden upon for years that it would not be\nnatural for you to quite trust me,\" she said. \"But I won't fail you,\nBetty--I won't.\"\n\nThe winter was drawing in, the last autumn days were short and often\ngrey and dreary; the wind had swept the leaves from the trees and\nscattered them over park lands and lanes, where they lay a mellow-hued,\nrustling carpet, shifting with each chill breeze that blew. The berried\nbriony garlands clung to the bared hedges, and here and there flared\nscarlet, still holding their red defiantly until hard frosts should come\nto shrivel and blacken them. The rare hours of sunshine were amber hours\ninstead of golden.\n\nAs she passed through the park gate Betty was thinking of the first\nmorning on which she had walked down the village street between the\nirregular rows of red-tiled cottages with the ragged little enclosing\ngardens. Then the air and sunshine had been of the just awakening\nspring, now the sky was brightly cold, and through the small-paned\nwindows she caught glimpses of fireglow. A bent old man walking very\nslowly, leaning upon two sticks, had a red-brown woollen muffler wrapped\nround his neck. Seeing her, he stopped and shuffled the two sticks\ninto one hand that he might leave the other free to touch his wrinkled\nforehead stiffly, his face stretching into a slow smile as she stopped\nto speak to him.\n\n\"Good-morning, Marlow,\" he said. \"How is the rheumatism to-day?\"\n\nHe was a deaf old man, whose conversation was carried on principally by\nguesswork, and it was easy for him to gather that when her ladyship's\nhandsome young sister had given him greeting she had not forgotten to\ninquire respecting the \"rheumatics,\" which formed the greater part of\nexistence.\n\n\"Mornin', miss--mornin',\" he answered in the high, cracked voice\nof rural ancientry. \"Winter be nigh, an' they damp days be full of\nrheumatiz. 'T'int easy to get about on my old legs, but I be main\nthankful for they warm things you sent, miss. This 'ere,\" fumbling at\nhis red-brown muffler proudly, \"'tis a comfort on windy days, so\n'tis, and warmth be a good thing to a man when he be goin' down hill in\nyears.\"\n\n\"All of you who are not able to earn your own fires shall be warm this\nwinter,\" her ladyship's handsome sister said, speaking closer to his\near. \"You shall all be warm. Don't be afraid of the cold days coming.\"\n\nHe shuffled his sticks and touched his forehead again, looking up at her\nadmiringly and chuckling.\n\n\"'T'will be a new tale for Stornham village,\" he cackled. \"'T'will be\na new tale. Thank ye, miss. Thank ye.\"\n\nAs she nodded smilingly and passed on, she heard him cackling still\nunder his breath as he hobbled on his slow way, comforted and elate. How\nalmost shamefully easy it was; a few loads of coal and faggots here and\nthere, a few blankets and warm garments whose cost counted for so little\nwhen one's hands were full, could change a gruesome village winter into\na season during which labour-stiffened and broken old things, closing\ntheir cottage doors, could draw their chairs round the hearth and\nhover luxuriously over the red glow, which in its comforting fashion of\nseeming to have understanding of the dull dreams in old eyes, was more\nto be loved than any human friend.\n\nBut she had not needed her passing speech with Marlow to stimulate\nrealisation of how much she had learned to care for the mere living\namong these people, to whom she seemed to have begun to belong, and\nwhose comfortably lighting faces when they met her showed that they knew\nher to be one who might be turned to in any hour of trouble or dismay.\nThe centuries which had trained them to depend upon their \"betters\" had\ntaught the slowest of them to judge with keen sight those who were to be\ntrusted, not alone as power and wealth holders, but as creatures humanly\nupright and merciful with their kind.\n\n\"Workin' folk allus knows gentry,\" old Doby had once shrilled to her.\n\"Gentry's gentry, an' us knows 'em wheresoever they be. Better'n they\nknow theirselves. So us do!\"\n\nYes, they knew. And though they accepted many things as being merely\ntheir natural rights, they gave an unsentimental affection and\nappreciation in return. The patriarchal note in the life was lovable to\nher. Each creature she passed was a sort of friend who seemed almost of\nher own blood. It had come to that. This particular existence was\nmore satisfying to her than any other, more heart-filling and warmly\ncomplete.\n\n\"Though I am only an impostor,\" she thought; \"I was born in Fifth\nAvenue; yet since I have known this I shall be quite happy in no other\nplace than an English village, with a Norman church tower looking down\nupon it and rows of little gardens with spears of white and blue lupins\nand Canterbury bells standing guard before cottage doors.\"\n\nAnd Rosalie--on the evening of that first strange day when she had\ncome upon her piteous figure among the heather under the trees near\nthe lake--Rosalie had held her arm with a hot little hand and had said\nfeverishly:\n\n\"If I could hear the roar of Broadway again! Do the stages rattle as\nthey used to, Betty? I can't help hoping that they do.\"\n\nShe carried her letter to the post and stopped to talk a few minutes\nwith the postmaster, who transacted his official business in a small\nshop where sides of bacon and hams hung suspended from the ceiling,\nwhile groceries, flannels, dress prints, and glass bottles of sweet\nstuff filled the shelves. \"Mr. Tewson's\" was the central point of\nStornham in a commercial sense. The establishment had also certain\nsocial qualifications.\n\nMr. Tewson knew the secrets of all hearts within the village radius,\nalso the secrets of all constitutions. He knew by some occult means who\nhad been \"taken bad,\" or who had \"taken a turn,\" and was aware at once\nwhen anyone was \"sinkin' fast.\" With such differences of opinion as\noccasionally arose between the vicar and his churchwardens he was\nimmediately familiar. The history of the fever among the hop pickers at\nDunstan village he had been able to relate in detail from the moment of\nits outbreak. It was he who had first dramatically revealed the truth of\nthe action Miss Vanderpoel had taken in the matter, which revelation had\naroused such enthusiasm as had filled The Clock Inn to overflowing and\ngiven an impetus to the sale of beer. Tread, it was said, had even\nmade a speech which he had ended with vague but excellent intentions by\nproposing the joint healths of her ladyship's sister and the \"President\nof America.\" Mr. Tewson was always glad to see Miss Vanderpoel cross his\nthreshold. This was not alone because she represented the custom of the\nCourt, which since her arrival had meant large regular orders and large\nbills promptly paid, but that she brought with her an exotic atmosphere\nof interest and excitement.\n\nHe had mentioned to friends that somehow a talk with her made him feel\n\"set up for the day.\" Betty was not at all sure that he did not prepare\nand hoard up choice remarks or bits of information as openings to\nconversation.\n\nThis morning he had thrilling news for her and began with it at once.\n\n\"Dr. Fenwick at Stornham is very low, miss,\" he said. \"He's very low,\nyou'll be sorry to hear. The worry about the fever upset him terrible\nand his bronchitis took him bad. He's an old man, you know.\"\n\nMiss Vanderpoel was very sorry to hear it. It was quite in the natural\norder of things that she should ask other questions about Dunstan\nvillage and the Mount, and she asked several.\n\nThe fever was dying out and pale convalescents were sometimes seen in\nthe village or strolling about the park. His lordship was taking care\nof the people and doing his best for them until they should be strong\nenough to return to their homes.\n\n\"But he's very strict about making it plain that it's you, miss, they\nhave to thank for what he does.\"\n\n\"That is not quite just,\" said Miss Vanderpoel. \"He and Mr. Penzance\nfought on the field. I only supplied some of the ammunition.\"\n\n\"The county doesn't think of him as it did even a year ago, miss,\" said\nTewson rather smugly. \"He was very ill thought of then among the gentry.\nIt's wonderful the change that's come about. If he should fall ill\nthere'll be a deal of sympathy.\"\n\n\"I hope there is no question of his falling ill,\" said Miss Vanderpoel.\n\nMr. Tewson lowered his voice confidentially. This was really his most\nvaluable item of news.\n\n\"Well, miss,\" he admitted, \"I have heard that he's been looking very bad\nfor a good bit, and it was told me quite private, because the doctors\nand the vicar don't want the people to be upset by hearing it--that for\na week he's not been well enough to make his rounds.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" The exclamation was a faint one, but it was an exclamation.\n\"I hope that means nothing really serious,\" Miss Vanderpoel added.\n\"Everyone will hope so.\"\n\n\"Yes, miss,\" said Mr. Tewson, deftly twisting the string round the\npackage he was tying up for her. \"A sad reward it would be if he lost\nhis life after doing all he has done. A sad reward! But there'd be a\ngood deal of sympathy.\"\n\nThe small package contained trifles of sewing and knitting materials she\nwas going to take to Mrs. Welden, and she held out her hand for it. She\nknew she did not smile quite naturally as she said her good-morning\nto Tewson. She went out into the pale amber sunshine and stood a few\nmoments, glad to find herself bathed in it again. She suddenly needed\nair and light. \"A sad reward!\" Sometimes people were not rewarded. Brave\nmen were shot dead on the battlefield when they were doing brave things;\nbrave physicians and nurses died of the plagues they faithfully wrestled\nwith. Here were dread and pain confronting her--Betty Vanderpoel--and\nwhile almost everyone else seemed to have faced them, she was wholly\nunused to their appalling clutch. What a life hers had been--that in\nlooking back over it she should realise that she had never been touched\nby anything like this before! There came back to her the look of almost\nawed wonder in G. Selden's honest eyes when he said: \"What it must be to\nbe you--just YOU!\" He had been thinking only of the millions and of\nthe freedom from all everyday anxieties the millions gave. She smiled\nfaintly as the thought crossed her brain. The millions! The rolling\nup of them year by year, because millions were breeders! The newspaper\nstories of them--the wonder at and belief in their power! It was all\ngoing on just as before, and yet here stood a Vanderpoel in an English\nvillage street, of no more worth as far as power to aid herself went\nthan Joe Buttle's girl with the thick waist and round red cheeks. Jenny\nButtle would have believed that her ladyship's rich American sister\ncould do anything she chose, open any door, command any presence,\nsweep aside any obstacle with a wave of her hand. But of the two, Jenny\nButtle's path would have laid straighter before her. If she had had \"a\nyoung man\" who had fallen ill she would have been free if his mother had\ncherished no objection to their \"walking out\"--to spend all her spare\nhours in his cottage, making gruel and poultices, crying until her\nnose and eyes were red, and pouring forth her hopes and fears to any\nneighbour who came in or out or hung over the dividing garden hedge. If\nthe patient died, the deeper her mourning and the louder her sobs at his\nfuneral the more respectable and deserving of sympathy and admiration\nwould Jenny Buttle have been counted. Her ladyship's rich American\nsister had no \"young man\"; she had not at any time been asked to \"walk\nout.\" Even in the dark days of the fever, each of which had carried\nthought and action of hers to the scene of trouble, there had reigned\nunbroken silence, except for the vicar's notes of warm and appreciative\ngratitude.\n\n\"You are very obstinate, Fergus,\" Mr. Penzance had said.\n\nAnd Mount Dunstan had shaken his head fiercely and answered:\n\n\"Don't speak to me about it. Only obstinacy will save me from behaving\nlike--other blackguards.\"\n\nMr. Penzance, carefully polishing his eyeglasses as he watched him, was\nnot sparing in his comment.\n\n\"That is pure folly,\" he said, \"pure bull-necked, stubborn folly,\ncharging with its head down. Before it has done with you it will have\nmade you suffer quite enough.\"\n\n\"Be sure of that,\" Mount Dunstan had said, setting his teeth, as he\nsat in his chair clasping his hands behind his head and glowering into\nspace.\n\nMr. Penzance quietly, speculatively, looked him over, and reflected\naloud--or, so it sounded.\n\n\"It is a big-boned and big-muscled characteristic, but there are things\nwhich are stronger. Some one minute will arrive--just one minute--which\nwill be stronger. One of those moments when the mysteries of the\nuniverse are at work.\"\n\n\"Don't speak to me like that, I tell you!\" Mount Dunstan broke out\npassionately. And he sprang up and marched out of the room like an angry\nman.\n\nMiss Vanderpoel did not go to Mrs. Welden's cottage at once, but walked\npast its door down the lane, where there were no more cottages, but only\nhedges and fields on either side of her. \"Not well enough to make his\nrounds\" might mean much or little. It might mean a temporary breakdown\nfrom overfatigue or a sickening for deadly illness. She looked at a\ngroup of cropping sheep in a field and at a flock of rooks which had\njust alighted near it with cawing and flapping of wings. She kept her\neyes on them merely to steady herself. The thoughts she had brought out\nwith her had grown heavier and were horribly difficult to control. One\nmust not allow one's self to believe the worst will come--one must not\nallow it.\n\nShe always held this rule before herself, and now she was not holding\nit steadily. There was nothing to do. She could write a mere note of\ninquiry to Mr. Penzance, but that was all. She could only walk up and\ndown the lanes and think--whether he lay dying or not. She could do\nnothing, even if a day came when she knew that a pit had been dug in the\nclay and he had been lowered into it with creaking ropes, and the clods\nshovelled back upon him where he lay still--never having told her that\nhe was glad that her being had turned to him and her heart cried aloud\nhis name. She recalled with curious distinctness the effect of the\nsteady toll of the church bell--the \"passing bell.\"\n\nShe could hear it as she had heard it the first time it fell upon\nher ear, and she had inquired what it meant. Why did they call it the\n\"passing bell\"? All had passed before it began to toll--all had passed.\nIf it tolled at Dunstan and the pit was dug in the churchyard before\nher father came, would he see, the moment they met, that something had\nbefallen her--that the Betty he had known was changed--gone? Yes, he\nwould see. Affection such as his always saw. Then he would sit alone\nwith her in some quiet room and talk to her, and she would tell him the\nstrange thing that had happened. He would understand--perhaps better\nthan she.\n\nShe stopped abruptly in her walk and stood still. The hand holding her\npackage was quite cold. This was what one must not allow one's self. But\nhow the thoughts had raced through her brain! She turned and hastened\nher steps towards Mrs. Welden's cottage.\n\nIn Mrs. Welden's tiny back yard there stood a \"coal lodge\" suited to the\nsize of the domicile and already stacked with a full winter's supply\nof coal. Therefore the well-polished and cleanly little grate in the\nliving-room was bright with fire.\n\nOld Doby, who had tottered round the corner to pay his fellow gossip a\nvisit, was sitting by it, and old Mrs. Welden, clean as to cap and apron\nand small purple shoulder shawl, had evidently been allaying his natural\nanxiety as to the conduct of foreign sovereigns by reading in a loud\nvoice the \"print\" under the pictures in an illustrated paper.\n\nThis occupation had, however, been interrupted a few moments before Miss\nVanderpoel's arrival. Mrs. Bester, the neighbour in the next\ncottage, had stepped in with her youngest on her hip and was talking\nbreathlessly. She paused to drop her curtsy as Betty entered, and old\nDoby stood up and made his salute with a trembling hand,\n\n\"She'll know,\" he said. \"Gentry knows the ins an' outs of gentry fust.\nShe'll know the rights.\"\n\n\"What has happened?\"\n\nMrs. Bester unexpectedly burst into tears. There was an element in\nthe female villagers' temperament which Betty had found was frequently\nunexpected in its breaking forth.\n\n\"He's down, miss,\" she said. \"He's down with it crool bad. There'll be\nno savin' of him--none.\"\n\nBetty laid her package of sewing cotton and knitting wool quietly on the\nblue and white checked tablecloth.\n\n\"Who--is he?\" she asked.\n\n\"His lordship--and him just saved all Dunstan parish from death--to go\nlike this!\"\n\nIn Stornham village and in all others of the neighbourhood the feminine\nattitude towards Mount Dunstan had been one of strongly emotional\nadmiration. The thwarted female longing for romance--the desire for\ndrama and a hero had been fed by him. A fine, big young man, one that\nhad been \"spoke ill of\" and regarded as an outcast, had suddenly turned\nthe tables on fortune and made himself the central figure of the county,\nthe talk of gentry in their grand houses, of cottage women on their\ndoorsteps, and labourers stopping to speak to each other by the\nroadside. Magic stories had been told of him, beflowered with dramatic\ndetail. No incident could have been related to his credit which would\nnot have been believed and improved upon. Shut up in his village working\namong his people and unseen by outsiders, he had become a popular idol.\nAny scrap of news of him--any rumour, true or untrue, was seized upon\nand excitedly spread abroad. Therefore Mrs. Bester wept as she talked,\nand, if the truth must be told, enjoyed the situation. She was the first\nto tell the story to her ladyship's sister herself, as well as to Mrs.\nWelden and old Doby.\n\n\"It's Tom as brought it in,\" she said. \"He's my brother, miss, an' he's\none of the ringers. He heard it from Jem Wesgate, an' he heard it at\nToomy's farm. They've been keepin' it hid at the Mount because the\npeople that's ill hangs on his lordship so that the doctors daren't let\nthem know the truth. They've been told he had to go to London an' may\ncome back any day. What Tom was sayin', miss, was that we'd all know\nwhen it was over, for we'd hear the church bell toll here same as it'd\ntoll at Dunstan, because they ringers have talked it over an' they're\ngoin' to talk it over to-day with the other parishes--Yangford an'\nMeltham an' Dunholm an' them. Tom says Stornham ringers met just now at\nThe Clock an' said that for a man that's stood by labouring folk like he\nhas, toll they will, an' so ought the other parishes, same as if he was\nroyalty, for he's made himself nearer. They'll toll the minute they hear\nit, miss. Lord help us!\" with a fresh outburst of crying. \"It don't seem\nlike it's fair as it should be. When we hear the bell toll, miss----\"\n\n\"Don't!\" said her ladyship's handsome sister suddenly. \"Please don't say\nit again.\"\n\nShe sat down by the table, and resting her elbows on the blue and white\nchecked cloth, covered her face with her hands. She did not speak at\nall. In this tiny room, with these two old souls who loved her, she need\nnot explain. She sat quite still, and Mrs. Welden after looking at her\nfor a few seconds was prompted by some sublimely simple intuition, and\ngently sidled Mrs. Bester and her youngest into the little kitchen,\nwhere the copper was.\n\n\"Her helpin' him like she did, makes it come near,\" she whispered.\n\"Dessay it seems as if he was a'most like a relation.\"\n\nOld Doby sat and looked at his goddess. In his slowly moving old brain\nstirred far-off memories like long-dead things striving to come to life.\nHe did not know what they were, but they wakened his dim eyes to a new\nseeing of the slim young shape leaning a little forward, the soft cloud\nof hair, the fair beauty of the cheek. He had not seen anything like\nit in his youth, but--it was Youth itself, and so was that which the\nringers were so soon to toll for; and for some remote and unformed\nreason, to his scores of years they were pitiful and should be cheered.\nHe bent forward himself and put out his ancient, veined and knotted,\ngnarled and trembling hand, to timorously touch the arm of her he\nworshipped and adored.\n\n\"God bless ye!\" he said, his high, cracked voice even more shrill and\nthin than usual. \"God bless ye!\" And as she let her hands slip down,\nand, turning, gently looked at him, he nodded to her speakingly, because\nout of the dimness of his being, some part of Nature's working had\nstrangely answered and understood.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVI\n\nLISTENING\n\nOn her way back to the Court her eyes saw only the white road before\nher feet as she walked. She did not lift them until she found herself\npassing the lych-gate at the entrance to the churchyard. Then suddenly\nshe looked up at the square grey stone tower where the bells hung, and\nfrom which they called the village to church, or chimed for weddings--or\ngave slowly forth to the silent air one heavy, regular stroke after\nanother. She looked and shuddered, and spoke aloud with a curious,\npassionate imploring, like a child's.\n\n\"Oh, don't toll! Don't toll! You must not! You cannot!\" Terror had\nsprung upon her, and her heart was being torn in two in her breast. That\nwas surely what it seemed like--this agonising ache of fear. Now from\nhour to hour she would be waiting and listening to each sound borne on\nthe air. Her thought would be a possession she could not escape. When\nshe spoke or was spoken to, she would be listening--when she was silent\nevery echo would hold terror, when she slept--if sleep should come to\nher--her hearing would be awake, and she would be listening--listening\neven then. It was not Betty Vanderpoel who was walking along the white\nroad, but another creature--a girl whose brain was full of abnormal\nthought, and whose whole being made passionate outcry against the thing\nwhich was being slowly forced upon her. If the bell tolled--suddenly,\nthe whole world would be swept clean of life--empty and clean. If the\nbell tolled.\n\nBefore the entrance of the Court she saw, as she approached it, the\nvicarage pony carriage, standing as it had stood on the day she had\nreturned from her walk on the marshes. She felt it quite natural that it\nshould be there. Mrs. Brent always seized upon any fragment of news,\nand having seized on something now, she had not been able to resist the\nexcitement of bringing it to Lady Anstruthers and her sister.\n\nShe was in the drawing-room with Rosalie, and was full of her subject\nand the emotion suitable to the occasion. She had even attained a\ncertain modified dampness of handkerchief. Rosalie's handkerchief,\nhowever, was not damp. She had not even attempted to use it, but sat\nstill, her eyes brimming with tears, which, when she saw Betty, brimmed\nover and slipped helplessly down her cheeks.\n\n\"Betty!\" she exclaimed, and got up and went towards her, \"I believe you\nhave heard.\"\n\n\"In the village, I heard something--yes,\" Betty answered, and after\ngiving greeting to Mrs. Brent, she led her sister back to her chair, and\nsat near her.\n\nThis--the thought leaped upon her--was the kind of situation she must be\nprepared to be equal to. In the presence of these who knew nothing,\nshe must bear herself as if there was nothing to be known. No one but\nherself had the slightest knowledge of what the past months had brought\nto her--no one in the world. If the bell tolled, no one in the world but\nher father ever would know. She had no excuse for emotion. None had been\ngiven to her. The kind of thing it was proper that she should say and do\nnow, in the presence of Mrs. Brent, it would be proper and decent that\nshe should say and do in all other cases. She must comport herself as\nBetty Vanderpoel would if she were moved only by ordinary human sympathy\nand regret.\n\n\"We must remember that we have only excited rumour to depend upon,\" she\nsaid. \"Lord Mount Dunstan has kept his village under almost military\nlaw. He has put it into quarantine. No one is allowed to leave it, so\nthere can be no direct source of information. One cannot be sure of the\nentire truth of what one hears. Often it is exaggerated cottage talk.\nThe whole neighbourhood is wrought up to a fever heat of excited\nsympathy. And villagers like the drama of things.\"\n\nMrs. Brent looked at her admiringly, it being her fixed habit to admire\nMiss Vanderpoel, and all such as Providence had set above her.\n\n\"Oh, how wise you are, Miss Vanderpoel!\" she exclaimed, even devoutly.\n\"It is so nice of you to be calm and logical when everybody else is so\nupset. You are quite right about villagers enjoying the dramatic side of\ntroubles. They always do. And perhaps things are not so bad as they say.\nI ought not to have let myself believe the worst. But I quite broke down\nunder the ringers--I was so touched.\"\n\n\"The ringers?\" faltered Lady Anstruthers\n\n\"The leader came to the vicar to tell him they wanted permission to\ntoll--if they heard tolling at Dunstan. Weaver's family lives within\nhearing of Dunstan church bells, and one of his boys is to run across\nthe fields and bring the news to Stornham. And it was most touching,\nMiss Vanderpoel. They feel, in their rustic way, that Lord Mount Dunstan\nhas not been treated fairly in the past. And now he seems to them a hero\nand a martyr--or like a great soldier who has died fighting.\"\n\n\"Who MAY die fighting,\" broke from Miss Vanderpoel sharply.\n\n\"Who--who may----\" Mrs. Brent corrected herself, \"though Heaven grant he\nwill not. But it was the ringers who made me feel as if all really\nwas over. Thank you, Miss Vanderpoel, thank you for being so practical\nand--and cool.\"\n\n\"It WAS touching,\" said Lady Anstruthers, her eyes brimming over again.\n\"And what the villagers feel is true. It goes to one's heart,\" in a\nlittle outburst. \"People have been unkind to him! And he has been lonely\nin that great empty place--he has been lonely. And if he is dying\nto-day, he is lonely even as he dies--even as he dies.\"\n\nBetty drew a deep breath. For one moment there seemed to rise before\nher vision of a huge room, whose stately size made its bareness a more\ndesolate thing. And Mr. Penzance bent low over the bed. She tore her\nthought away from it.\n\n\"No! No!\" she cried out in low, passionate protest. \"There will be\nlove and yearning all about him everywhere. The villagers who are\nwaiting--the poor things he has worked for--the very ringers themselves,\nare all pouring forth the same thoughts. He will feel even ours--ours\ntoo! His soul cannot be lonely.\"\n\nA few minutes earlier, Mrs. Brent had been saying to herself inwardly:\n\"She has not much heart after all, you know.\" Now she looked at her in\namazement.\n\nThe blue bells were under water in truth--drenched and drowned. And yet\nas the girl stood up before her, she looked taller--more the magnificent\nMiss Vanderpoel than ever--though she expressed a new meaning.\n\n\"There is one thing the villagers can do for him,\" she said. \"One thing\nwe can all do. The bell has not tolled yet. There is a service for those\nwho are--in peril. If the vicar will call the people to the church, we\ncan all kneel down there--and ask to be heard. The vicar will do that I\nam sure--and the people will join him with all their hearts.\"\n\nMrs. Brent was overwhelmed.\n\n\"Dear, dear, Miss Vanderpoel!\" she exclaimed. \"THAT is touching, indeed\nit is! And so right and so proper. I will drive back to the village at\nonce. The vicar's distress is as great as mine. You think of everything.\nThe service for the sick and dying. How right--how right!\"\n\nWith a sense of an increase of value in herself, the vicar, and the\nvicarage, she hastened back to the pony carriage, but in the hall she\nseized Betty's hand emotionally.\n\n\"I cannot tell you how much I am touched by this,\" she murmured. \"I did\nnot know you were--were a religious girl, my dear.\"\n\nBetty answered with grave politeness.\n\n\"In times of great pain and terror,\" she said, \"I think almost everybody\nis religious--a little. If that is the right word.\"\n\nThere was no ringing of the ordinary call to service. In less than an\nhour's time people began to come out of their cottages and wend their\nway towards the church. No one had put on his or her Sunday clothes. The\nwomen had hastily rolled down their sleeves, thrown off their aprons,\nand donned everyday bonnets and shawls. The men were in their corduroys,\nas they had come in from the fields, and the children wore their\npinafores. As if by magic, the news had flown from house to house, and\neach one who had heard it had left his or her work without a moment's\nhesitation. They said but little as they made their way to the church.\nBetty, walking with her sister, was struck by the fact that there were\nmore of them than formed the usual Sunday morning congregation. They\nwere doing no perfunctory duty. The men's faces were heavily moved,\nmost of the women wiped their eyes at intervals, and the children looked\nawed. There was a suggestion of hurried movement in the step of each--as\nif no time must be lost--as if they must begin their appeal at once.\nBetty saw old Doby tottering along stiffly, with his granddaughter and\nMrs. Welden on either side of him. Marlow, on his two sticks, was to be\nseen moving slowly, but steadily.\n\nWithin the ancient stone walls, stiff old knees bent themselves with\ncare, and faces were covered devoutly by work-hardened hands. As\nshe passed through the churchyard Betty knew that eyes followed her\naffectionately, and that the touching of foreheads and dropping of\ncurtsies expressed a special sympathy. In each mind she was connected\nwith the man they came to pray for--with the work he had done--with\nthe danger he was in. It was vaguely felt that if his life ended, a\nbereavement would have fallen upon her. This the girl knew.\n\nThe vicar lifted his bowed head and began his service. Every man, woman\nand child before him responded aloud and with a curious fervour--not in\ndecorous fear of seeming to thrust themselves before the throne, making\ntoo much of their petitions, in the presence of the gentry. Here and\nthere sobs were to be heard. Lady Anstruthers followed the service\ntimorously and with tears. But Betty, kneeling at her side, by the round\ntable in the centre of the great square Stornham pew, which was like a\nroom, bowed her head upon her folded arms, and prayed her own intense,\ninsistent prayer.\n\n\"God in Heaven!\" was her inward cry. \"God of all the worlds! Do not let\nhim die. 'If ye ask anything in my name that I will do.' Christ said it.\nIn the name of Jesus of Nazareth--do not let him die! All the worlds are\nyours--all the power--listen to us--listen to us. Lord, I believe--help\nthou my unbelief. If this terror robs me of faith, and I pray\nmadly--forgive, forgive me. Do not count it against me as sin. You made\nhim. He has suffered and been alone. It is not time--it is not time yet\nfor him to go. He has known no joy and no bright thing. Do not let him\ngo out of the warm world like a blind man. Do not let him die. Perhaps\nthis is not prayer, but raging. Forgive--forgive! All power is gone from\nme. God of the worlds, and the great winds, and the myriad stars--do not\nlet him die!\"\n\nShe knew her thoughts were wild, but their torrent bore her with them\ninto a strange, great silence. She did not hear the vicar's words, or\nthe responses of the people. She was not within the grey stone walls.\nShe had been drawn away as into the darkness and stillness of the night,\nand no soul but her own seemed near. Through the stillness and the dark\nher praying seemed to call and echo, clamouring again and again. It must\nreach Something--it must be heard, because she cried so loud, though to\nthe human beings about her she seemed kneeling in silence. She went on\nand on, repeating her words, changing them, ending and beginning again,\npouring forth a flood of appeal. She thought later that the flood must\nhave been at its highest tide when, singularly, it was stemmed. Without\nwarning, a wave of awe passed over her which strangely silenced her--and\nleft her bowed and kneeling, but crying out no more. The darkness had\nbecome still, even as it had not been still before. Suddenly she cowered\nas she knelt and held her breath. Something had drawn a little near. No\nthoughts--no words--no cries were needed as the great stillness grew and\nspread, and folded her being within it. She waited--only waited. She did\nnot know how long a time passed before she felt herself drawn back from\nthe silent and shadowy places--awakening, as it were, to the sounds in\nthe church.\n\n\"Our Father,\" she began to say, as simply as a child. \"Our Father who\nart in Heaven--hallowed be thy name.\" There was a stirring among the\ncongregation, and sounds of feet, as the people began to move down the\naisle in reverent slowness. She caught again the occasional sound of a\nsubdued sob. Rosalie gently touched her, and she rose, following her out\nof the big pew and passing down the aisle after the villagers.\n\nOutside the entrance the people waited as if they wanted to see her\nagain. Foreheads were touched as before, and eyes followed her. She was\nto the general mind the centre of the drama, and \"the A'mighty\" would\ndo well to hear her. She had been doing his work for him \"same as his\nlordship.\" They did not expect her to smile at such a time, when she\nreturned their greetings, and she did not, but they said afterwards, in\ntheir cottages, that \"trouble or not she was a wonder for looks, that\nshe was--Miss Vanderpoel.\"\n\nRosalie slipped a hand through her arm, and they walked home together,\nvery close to each other. Now and then there was a questioning in Rosy's\nlook. But neither of them spoke once.\n\nOn an oak table in the hall a letter from Mr. Penzance was lying. It\nwas brief, hurried, and anxious. The rumour that Mount Dunstan had been\nailing was true, and that they had felt they must conceal the matter\nfrom the villagers was true also. For some baffling reason the fever\nhad not absolutely declared itself, but the young doctors were beset\nby grave forebodings. In such cases the most serious symptoms might\nsuddenly develop. One never knew. Mr. Penzance was evidently torn by\nfears which he desperately strove to suppress. But Betty could see the\nanguish on his fine old face, and between the lines she read dread and\nwarning not put into words. She believed that, fearing the worst, he\nfelt he must prepare her mind.\n\n\"He has lived under a great strain for months,\" he ended. \"It began long\nbefore the outbreak of the fever. I am not strong under my sense of the\ncruelty of things--and I have never loved him as I love him to-day.\"\n\nBetty took the letter to her room, and read it two or three times.\nBecause she had asked intelligent questions of the medical authority she\nhad consulted on her visit to London, she knew something of the fever\nand its habits. Even her unclerical knowledge was such as it was not\nwell to reflect upon. She refolded the letter and laid it aside.\n\n\"I must not think. I must do something. It may prevent my listening,\"\nshe said aloud to the silence of her room.\n\nShe cast her eyes about her as if in search. Upon her desk lay a\nnotebook. She took it up and opened it. It contained lists of plants,\nof flower seeds, of bulbs, and shrubs. Each list was headed with an\nexplanatory note.\n\n\"Yes, this will do,\" she said. \"I will go and talk to Kedgers.\"\n\nKedgers and every man under him had been at the service, but they had\nreturned to their respective duties. Kedgers, giving directions to some\nunder gardeners who were clearing flower beds and preparing them for\ntheir winter rest, turned to meet her as she approached. To Kedgers the\nsight of her coming towards him on a garden path was a joyful thing. He\nhad done wonders, it is true, but if she had not stood by his side with\ninspiration as well as confidence, he knew that things might have \"come\nout different.\"\n\n\"You was born a gardener, miss--born one,\" he had said months ago.\n\nIt was the time when flower beds must be planned for the coming year.\nHer notebook was filled with memoranda of the things they must talk\nabout.\n\nIt was good, normal, healthy work to do. The scent of the rich, damp,\nupturned mould was a good thing to inhale. They walked from one end to\nanother, stood before clumps of shrubs, and studied bits of wall. Here\na mass of blue might grow, here low things of white and pale yellow. A\nquickly-climbing rose would hang sheets of bloom over this dead tree.\nThis sheltered wall would hold warmth for a Marechal Niel.\n\n\"You must take care of it all--even if I am not here next year,\" Miss\nVanderpoel said.\n\nKedgers' absorbed face changed.\n\n\"Not here, miss,\" he exclaimed. \"You not here! Things wouldn't grow,\nmiss.\" He checked himself, his weather-toughened skin reddening because\nhe was afraid he had perhaps taken a liberty. And then moving his hat\nuneasily on his head, he took another. \"But it's true enough,\" looking\ndown on the gravel walk, \"we--we couldn't expect to keep you.\"\n\nShe did not look as if she had noticed the liberty, but she did not look\nquite like herself, Kedgers thought. If she had been another young lady,\nand but for his established feeling that she was somehow immune from all\nills, he would have thought she had a headache, or was low in her mind.\n\nShe spent an hour or two with him, and together they planned for the\nchanging seasons of the year to come. How she could keep her mind on a\nthing, and what a head she had for planning, and what an eye for colour!\nBut yes--there was something a bit wrong somehow. Now and then she would\nstop and stand still for a moment, and suddenly it struck Kedgers that\nshe looked as if she were listening.\n\n\"Did you think you heard something, miss?\" he asked her once when she\npaused and wore this look.\n\n\"No,\" she answered, \"no.\" And drew him on quickly--almost as if she did\nnot want him to hear what she had seemed listening for.\n\nWhen she left him and went back to the house, all the loveliness of\nspring, summer and autumn had been thought out and provided for. Kedgers\nstood on the path and looked after her until she passed through the\nterrace door. He chewed his lip uneasily. Then he remembered something\nand felt a bit relieved. It was the service he remembered.\n\n\"Ah! it's that that's upset her--and it's natural, seeing how she's\nhelped him and Dunstan village. It's only natural.\" He chewed his lip\nagain, and nodded his head in odd reflection. \"Ay! Ay!\" he summed her\nup. \"She's a great lady that--she's a great lady--same as if she'd been\nborn in a civilised land.\"\n\nDuring the rest of the day the look of question in Rosalie's eyes\nchanged in its nature. When her sister was near her she found herself\nglancing at her with a new feeling. It was a growing feeling, which\ngradually became--anxiousness. Betty presented to her the aspect of one\nwithdrawn into some remote space. She was not living this day as her\ndays were usually lived. She did not sit still or stroll about the\ngardens quietly. The consecutiveness of her action seemed broken. She\ndid one thing after another, as if she must fill each moment. This was\nnot her Betty. Lady Anstruthers watched and thought until, in the end,\na new pained fear began to creep slowly into her mind, and make her feel\nas if she were slightly trembling though her hands did not shake. She\ndid not dare to allow herself to think the thing she knew she was on the\nbrink of thinking. She thrust it away from her, and tried not to think\nat all. Her Betty--her splendid Betty, whom nothing could hurt--who\ncould not be touched by any awful thing--her dear Betty!\n\nIn the afternoon she saw her write notes steadily for an hour, then she\nwent out into the stables and visited the horses, talked to the coachman\nand to her own groom. She was very kind to a village boy who had been\nrecently taken on as an additional assistant in the stable, and who was\nrather frightened and shy. She knew his mother, who had a large family,\nand she had, indeed, given the boy his place that he might be trained\nunder the great Mr. Buckham, who was coachman and head of the stables.\nShe said encouraging things which quite cheered him, and she spoke\nprivately to Mr. Buckham about him. Then she walked in the park a\nlittle, but not for long. When she came back Rosalie was waiting for\nher.\n\n\"I want to take a long drive,\" she said. \"I feel restless. Will you\ncome with me, Betty?\" Yes, she would go with her, so Buckham brought the\nlandau with its pair of big horses, and they rolled down the avenue,\nand into the smooth, white high road. He took them far--past the\ngreat marshes, between miles of bared hedges, past farms and scattered\ncottages. Sometimes he turned into lanes, where the hedges were closer\nto each other, and where, here and there, they caught sight of new\npoints of view between trees. Betty was glad to feel Rosy's slim body\nnear her side, and she was conscious that it gradually seemed to draw\ncloser and closer. Then Rosy's hand slipped into hers and held it softly\non her lap.\n\nWhen they drove together in this way they were usually both of them\nrather silent and quiet, but now Rosalie spoke of many things--of\nUghtred, of Nigel, of the Dunholms, of New York, and their father and\nmother.\n\n\"I want to talk because I'm nervous, I think,\" she said half\napologetically. \"I do not want to sit still and think too much--of\nfather's coming. You don't mind my talking, do you, Betty?\"\n\n\"No,\" Betty answered. \"It is good for you and for me.\" And she met the\npressure of Rosy's hand halfway.\n\nBut Rosy was talking, not because she did not want to sit still and\nthink, but because she did not want Betty to do so. And all the time she\nwas trying to thrust away the thought growing in her mind.\n\nThey spent the evening together in the library, and Betty read aloud.\nShe read a long time--until quite late. She wished to tire herself as\nwell as to force herself to stop listening.\n\nWhen they said good-night to each other Rosy clung to her as desperately\nas she had clung on the night after her arrival. She kissed her again\nand again, and then hung her head and excused herself.\n\n\"Forgive me for being--nervous. I'm ashamed of myself,\" she said.\n\"Perhaps in time I shall get over being a coward.\"\n\nBut she said nothing of the fact that she was not a coward for herself,\nbut through a slowly formulating and struggled--against fear, which\nchilled her very heart, and which she could best cover by a pretence of\nbeing a poltroon.\n\nShe could not sleep when she went to bed. The night seemed crowded with\nstrange, terrified thoughts. They were all of Betty, though sometimes\nshe thought of her father's coming, of her mother in New York, and of\nBetty's steady working throughout the day. Sometimes she cried, twisting\nher hands together, and sometimes she dropped into a feverish sleep, and\ndreamed that she was watching Betty's face, yet was afraid to look at\nit.\n\nShe awakened suddenly from one of these dreams, and sat upright in bed\nto find the dawn breaking. She rose and threw on a dressing-gown, and\nwent to her sister's room because she could not bear to stay away.\n\nThe door was not locked, and she pushed it open gently. One of the\nwindows had its blind drawn up, and looked like a patch of dull grey.\nBetty was standing upright near it. She was in her night-gown, and a\nlong black plait of hair hung over one shoulder heavily. She looked all\nblack and white in strong contrast. The grey light set her forth as a\ntall ghost.\n\nLady Anstruthers slid forward, feeling a tightness in her chest.\n\n\"The dawn wakened me too,\" she said.\n\n\"I have been waiting to see it come,\" answered Betty. \"It is going to be\na dull, dreary day.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVII\n\n\"I HAVE NO WORD OR LOOK TO REMEMBER\"\n\nIt was a dull and dreary day, as Betty had foreseen it would be. Heavy\nrain clouds hung and threatened, and the atmosphere was damp and chill.\nIt was one of those days of the English autumn which speak only of the\nend of things, bereaving one of the power to remember next year's spring\nand summer, which, after all, must surely come. Sky is grey, trees are\ngrey, dead leaves lie damp beneath the feet, sunlight and birds seem\nforgotten things. All that has been sad and to be regretted or feared\nhangs heavy in the air and sways all thought. In the passing of these\nhours there is no hope anywhere. Betty appeared at breakfast in short\ndress and close hat. She wore thick little boots, as if for walking.\n\n\"I am going to make visits in the village,\" she said. \"I want a basket\nof good things to take with me. Stourton's children need feeding after\ntheir measles. They looked very thin when I saw them playing in the road\nyesterday.\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" Rosalie answered. \"Mrs. Noakes shall prepare the basket.\nGood chicken broth, and jelly, and nourishing things. Jennings,\" to the\nbutler, \"you know the kind of basket Miss Vanderpoel wants. Speak to\nMrs. Noakes, please.\"\n\n\"Yes, my lady,\" Jennings knew the kind of basket and so did Mrs. Noakes.\nBelow stairs a strong sympathy with Miss Vanderpoel's movements had\ndeveloped. No one resented the preparation of baskets. Somehow they were\nalways managed, even if asked for at untimely hours.\n\nBetty was sitting silent, looking out into the greyness of the\nautumn-smitten park.\n\n\"Are--are you listening for anything, Betty?\" Lady Anstruthers asked\nrather falteringly. \"You have a sort of listening look in your eyes.\"\n\nBetty came back to the room, as it were.\n\n\"Have I,\" she said. \"Yes, I think I was listening for--something.\"\n\nAnd Rosalie did not ask her what she listened for. She was afraid she\nknew.\n\nIt was not only the Stourtons Betty visited this morning. She passed\nfrom one cottage to another--to see old women, and old men, as well as\nyoung ones, who for one reason or another needed help and encouragement.\nBy one bedside she read aloud; by another she sat and told cheerful\nstories; she listened to talk in little kitchens, and in one house\nwelcomed a newborn thing. As she walked steadily over grey road and\ndown grey lanes damp mist rose and hung about her. And she did not walk\nalone. Fear walked with her, and anguish, a grey ghost by her side. Once\nshe found herself standing quite still on a side path, covering her face\nwith her hands. She filled every moment of the morning, and walked until\nshe was tired. Before she went home she called at the post office,\nand Mr. Tewson greeted her with a solemn face. He did not wait to be\nquestioned.\n\n\"There's been no news to-day, miss, so far,\" he said. \"And that seems\nas if they might be so given up to hard work at a dreadful time that\nthere's been no chance for anything to get out. When people's hanging\nover a man's bed at the end, it's as if everything stopped but\nthat--that's stopping for all time.\"\n\nAfter luncheon the rain began to fall softly, slowly, and with a\nsuggestion of endlessness. It was a sort of mist itself, and became a\ndamp shadow among the bare branches of trees which soon began to drip.\n\n\"You have been walking about all morning, and you are tired, dear,\" Lady\nAnstruthers said to her. \"Won't you go to your room and rest, Betty?\"\n\nYes, she would go to her room, she said. Some new books had arrived from\nLondon this morning, and she would look over them. She talked a little\nabout her visits before she went, and when, as she talked, Ughtred came\nover to her and stood close to her side holding her hand and stroking\nit, she smiled at him sweetly--the smile he adored. He stroked the hand\nand softly patted it, watching her wistfully. Suddenly he lifted it to\nhis lips, and kissed it again and again with a sort of passion.\n\n\"I love you so much, Aunt Betty,\" he cried. \"We both love you so much.\nSomething makes me love you to-day more than ever I did before. It\nalmost makes me cry. I love you so.\"\n\nShe stooped swiftly and drew him into her arms and kissed him close and\nhard. He held his head back a little and looked into the blue under her\nlashes.\n\n\"I love your eyes,\" he said. \"Anyone would love your eyes, Aunt Betty.\nBut what is the matter with them? You are not crying at all, but--oh!\nwhat is the matter?\"\n\n\"No, I am not crying at all,\" she said, and smiled--almost laughed.\n\nBut after she had kissed him again she took her books and went upstairs.\n\nShe did not lie down, and she did not read when she was alone in her\nroom. She drew a long chair before the window and watched the slow\nfalling of the rain. There is nothing like it--that slow weeping of the\nrain on an English autumn day. Soft and light though it was, the park\nbegan to look sodden. The bare trees held out their branches like\nimploring arms, the brown garden beds were neat and bare. The same rain\nwas drip-dripping at Mount Dunstan--upon the desolate great house--upon\nthe village--upon the mounds and ancient stone tombs in the churchyard,\nsinking into the earth--sinking deep, sucked in by the clay beneath--the\ncold damp clay. She shook herself shudderingly. Why should the thought\ncome to her--the cold damp clay? She would not listen to it, she would\nthink of New York, of its roaring streets and crash of sound, of the\nrush of fierce life there--of her father and mother. She tried to force\nherself to call up pictures of Broadway, swarming with crowds of black\nthings, which, seen from the windows of its monstrous buildings,\nseemed like swarms of ants, burst out of ant-hills, out of a thousand\nant-hills. She tried to remember shop windows, the things in them, the\nthrongs going by, and the throngs passing in and out of great, swinging\nglass doors. She dragged up before her a vision of Rosalie, driving\nwith her mother and herself, looking about her at the new buildings and\nchanged streets, flushed and made radiant by the accelerated pace and\nexcitement of her beloved New York. But, oh, the slow, penetrating\nrainfall, and--the cold damp clay!\n\nShe rose, making an involuntary sound which was half a moan. The long\nmirror set between two windows showed her momentarily an awful young\nfigure, throwing up its arms. Was that Betty Vanderpoel--that?\n\n\"What does one do,\" she said, \"when the world comes to an end? What does\none do?\"\n\nAll her days she had done things--there had always been something to do.\nNow there was nothing. She went suddenly to her bell and rang for her\nmaid. The woman answered the summons at once.\n\n\"Send word to the stable that I want Childe Harold. I do not want Mason.\nI shall ride alone.\"\n\n\"Yes, miss,\" Ambleston answered, without any exterior sign of emotion.\nShe was too well-trained a person to express any shade of her internal\namazement. After she had transmitted the order to the proper manager she\nreturned and changed her mistress's costume.\n\nShe had contemplated her task, and was standing behind Miss Vanderpoel's\nchair, putting the last touch to her veil, when she became conscious of\na slight stiffening of the neck which held so well the handsome head,\nthen the head slowly turned towards the window giving upon the front\npark. Miss Vanderpoel was listening to something, listening so intently\nthat Ambleston felt that, for a few moments, she did not seem to\nbreathe. The maid's hands fell from the veil, and she began to listen\nalso. She had been at the service the day before. Miss Vanderpoel rose\nfrom her chair slowly--very slowly, and took a step forward. Then she\nstood still and listened again.\n\n\"Open that window, if you please,\" she commanded--\"as if a stone image\nwas speaking\"--Ambleston said later. The window was thrown open, and for\na few seconds they both stood still again. When Miss Vanderpoel spoke,\nit was as if she had forgotten where she was, or as if she were in a\ndream.\n\n\"It is the ringers,\" she said. \"They are tolling the passing bell.\"\n\nThe serving woman was soft of heart, and had her feminine emotions.\nThere had been much talk of this thing in the servant's hall. She turned\nupon Betty, and forgot all rules and training.\n\n\"Oh, miss!\" she cried. \"He's gone--he's gone! That good man--out of this\nhard world. Oh, miss, excuse me--do!\" And as she burst into wild tears,\nshe ran out of the room.\n\n. . . . .\n\nRosalie had been sitting in the morning room. She also had striven to\noccupy herself with work. She had written to her mother, she had read,\nshe had embroidered, and then read again. What was Betty doing--what was\nshe thinking now? She laid her book down in her lap, and covering her\nface with her hands, breathed a desperate little prayer. That life\nshould be pain and emptiness to herself, seemed somehow natural since\nshe had married Nigel--but pain and emptiness for Betty--No! No! No! Not\nfor Betty! Piteous sorrow poured upon her like a flood. She did not know\nhow the time passed. She sat, huddled together in her chair, with hidden\nface. She could not bear to look at the rain and ghost mist out of\ndoors. Oh, if her mother were only here, and she might speak to her! And\nas her loving tears broke forth afresh, she heard the door open.\n\n\"If you please, my lady--I beg your pardon, my lady,\" as she started and\nuncovered her face.\n\n\"What is it, Jennings?\"\n\nThe figure at the door was that of the serious, elderly butler, and he\nwore a respectfully grave air.\n\n\"As your ladyship is sitting in this room, we thought it likely you\nwould not hear, the windows being closed, and we felt sure, my lady,\nthat you would wish to know----\"\n\nLady Anstruthers' hands shook as they clung to the arms of her chair.\n\n\"To know----\" she faltered. \"Hear what?\"\n\n\"The passing bell is tolling, my lady. It has just begun. It is for\nLord Mount Dunstan. There's not a dry eye downstairs, your ladyship, not\none.\"\n\nHe opened the windows, and she stood up. Jennings quietly left the room.\nThe slow, heavy knell struck ponderously on the damp air, and she stood\nand shivered.\n\nA moment or two later she turned, because it seemed as if she must.\n\nBetty, in her riding habit, was standing motionless against the door,\nher wonderful eyes still as death, gazing at her, gazing in an awful,\nsimple silence.\n\nOh, what was the use of being afraid to speak at such a time as this?\nIn one moment Rosy was kneeling at her feet, clinging about her knees,\nkissing her hands, the very cloth of her habit, and sobbing aloud.\n\n\"Oh, my darling--my love--my own Betty! I don't know--and I won't\nask--but speak to me--speak just a word--my dearest dear!\"\n\nBetty raised her up and drew her within the room, closing the door\nbehind them.\n\n\"Kind little Rosy,\" she said. \"I came to speak--because we two love each\nother. You need not ask, I will tell you. That bell is tolling for the\nman who taught me--to KNOW. He never spoke to me of love. I have not one\nword or look to remember. And now---- Oh, listen--listen! I have been\nlistening since the morning of yesterday.\" It was an awful thing--her\nwhite face, with all the flame of life swept out of it.\n\n\"Don't listen--darling--darling!\" Rosy cried out in anguish. \"Shut your\nears--shut your ears!\" And she tried to throw her arms around the high\nblack head, and stifle all sound with her embrace.\n\n\"I don't want to shut them,\" was the answer. \"All the unkindness and\nmisery are over for him, I ought to thank God--but I don't. I shall\nhear--O Rosy, listen!--I shall hear that to the end of my days.\"\n\nRosy held her tight, and rocked and sobbed.\n\n\"My Betty,\" she kept saying. \"My Betty,\" and she could say no more. What\nmore was there to say? At last Betty withdrew herself from her arms, and\nthen Rosalie noticed for the first time that she wore the habit.\n\n\"Dearest,\" she whispered, \"what are you going to do?\"\n\n\"I was going to ride, and I am going to do it still. I must do\nsomething. I shall ride a long, long way--and ride hard. You won't try\nto keep me, Rosy. You will understand.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" biting her lip, and looking at her with large, awed eyes, as she\npatted her arm with a hand that trembled. \"I would not hold you back,\nBetty, from anything in the world you chose to do.\"\n\nAnd with another long, clinging clasp of her, she let her go.\n\nMason was standing by Childe Harold when she went down the broad steps.\nHe also wore a look of repressed emotion, and stood with bared head\nbent, his eyes fixed on the gravel of the drive, listening to the heavy\nstrokes of the bell in the church tower, rather as if he were taking\npart in some solemn ceremony.\n\nHe mounted her silently, and after he had given her the bridle, looked\nup, and spoke in a somewhat husky voice:\n\n\"The order was that you did not want me, miss? Was that correct?\"\n\n\"Yes, I wish to ride alone.\"\n\n\"Yes, miss. Thank you, miss.\"\n\nChilde Harold was in good spirits. He held up his head, and blew the\nbreath through his delicate, dilated, red nostrils as he set out with\nhis favourite sidling, dancing steps. Mason watched him down the avenue,\nsaw the lodge keeper come out to open the gate, and curtsy as her\nladyship's sister passed through it. After that he went slowly back to\nthe stables, and sat in the harness-room a long time, staring at the\nfloor, as the bell struck ponderously on his ear.\n\nThe woman who had opened the gate for her Betty saw had red eyes. She\nknew why.\n\n\"A year ago they all thought of him as an outcast. They would have\nbelieved any evil they had heard connected with his name. Now, in every\ncottage, there is weeping--weeping. And he lies deaf and dumb,\" was her\nthought.\n\nShe did not wish to pass through the village, and turned down a side\nroad, which would lead her to where she could cross the marshes, and\ncome upon lonely places. The more lonely, the better. Every few moments\nshe caught her breath with a hard short gasp. The slow rain fell upon\nher, big round, crystal drops hung on the hedgerows, and dripped upon\nthe grass banks below them; the trees, wreathed with mist, were like\nwaiting ghosts as she passed them by; Childe Harold's hoof upon the\nroad, made a hollow, lonely sound.\n\nA thought began to fill her brain, and make insistent pressure upon it.\nShe tried no more to thrust thought away. Those who lay deaf and dumb,\nthose for whom people wept--where were they when the weeping seemed to\nsound through all the world? How far had they gone? Was it far? Could\nthey hear and could they see? If one plead with them aloud, could they\ndraw near to listen? Did they begin a long, long journey as soon as they\nhad slipped away? The \"wonder of the world,\" she had said, watching life\nswelling and bursting the seeds in Kedgers' hothouses! But this was a\ngreater wonder still, because of its awesomeness. This man had been, and\nwho dare say he was not--even now? The strength of his great body, the\nlook in his red-brown eyes, the sound of his deep voice, the struggle,\nthe meaning of him, where were they? She heard herself followed by the\nhollow echo of Childe Harold's hoofs, as she rode past copse and hedge,\nand wet spreading fields. She was this hour as he had been a month\nago. If, with some strange suddenness, this which was Betty Vanderpoel,\nslipped from its body----She put her hand up to her forehead. It was\nunthinkable that there would be no more. Where was he now--where was he\nnow?\n\nThis was the thought that filled her brain cells to the exclusion of all\nothers. Over the road, down through by-lanes, out on the marshes. Where\nwas he--where was he--WHERE? Childe Harold's hoofs began to beat it out\nas a refrain. She heard nothing else. She did not know where she was\ngoing and did not ask herself. She went down any road or lane which\nlooked empty of life, she took strange turnings, without caring; she did\nnot know how far she was afield.\n\nWhere was he now--this hour--this moment--where was he now? Did he know\nthe rain, the greyness, the desolation of the world?\n\nOnce she stopped her horse on the loneliness of the marsh land, and\nlooked up at the low clouds about her, at the creeping mist, the dank\ngrass. It seemed a place in which a newly-released soul might wander\nbecause it did not yet know its way.\n\n\"If you should be near, and come to me, you will understand,\" her clear\nvoice said gravely between the caught breaths, \"what I gave you was\nnothing to you--but you took it with you. Perhaps you know without my\ntelling you. I want you to know. When a man is dead, everything melts\naway. I loved you. I wish you had loved me.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVIII\n\nTHE MOMENT\n\nIn the unnatural unbearableness of her anguish, she lost sight of\nobjects as she passed them, she lost all memory of what she did. She did\nnot know how long she had been out, or how far she had ridden. When the\nthought of time or distance vaguely flitted across her mind, it seemed\nthat she had been riding for hours, and might have crossed one county\nand entered another. She had long left familiar places behind. Riding\nthrough and inclosed by the mist, she, herself, might have been a\nwandering ghost, lost in unknown places. Where was he now--where was he\nnow?\n\nAfterwards she could not tell how or when it was that she found herself\nbecoming conscious of the evidences that her horse had been ridden too\nlong and hard, and that he was worn out with fatigue. She did not know\nthat she had ridden round and round over the marshes, and had passed\nseveral times through the same lanes. Childe Harold, the sure of foot,\nactually stumbled, out of sheer weariness of limb. Perhaps it was this\nwhich brought her back to earth, and led her to look around her with\neyes which saw material objects with comprehension. She had reached the\nlonely places, indeed and the evening was drawing on. She was at\nthe edge of the marsh, and the land about her was strange to her and\ndesolate. At the side of a steep lane, overgrown with grass, and seeming\na mere cart-path, stood a deserted-looking, black and white, timbered\ncottage, which was half a ruin. Close to it was a dripping spinney,\nits trees forming a darkling background to the tumble-down house, whose\nthatch was rotting into holes, and its walls sagging forward perilously.\nThe bit of garden about it was neglected and untidy, here and there\nwindows were broken, and stuffed with pieces of ragged garments.\nAltogether a sinister and repellent place enough.\n\nShe looked at it with heavy eyes. (Where was he now--where was he\nnow?--This repeating itself in the far chambers of her brain.) Her sight\nseemed dimmed, not only by the mist, but by a sinking faintness which\npossessed her. She did not remember how little food she had eaten during\nmore than twenty-four hours. Her habit was heavy with moisture, and\nclung to her body; she was conscious of a hot tremor passing over her,\nand saw that her hands shook as they held the bridle on which they had\nlost their grip. She had never fainted in her life, and she was not\ngoing to faint now--women did not faint in these days--but she must\nreach the cottage and dismount, to rest under shelter for a short time.\nNo smoke was rising from the chimney, but surely someone was living in\nthe place, and could tell her where she was, and give her at least water\nfor herself and her horse. Poor beast! how wickedly she must have been\nriding him, in her utter absorption in her thoughts. He was wet, not\nalone with rain, but with sweat. He snorted out hot, smoking breaths.\n\nShe spoke to him, and he moved forward at her command. He was trembling\ntoo. Not more than two hundred yards, and she turned him into the lane.\nBut it was wet and slippery, and strewn with stones. His trembling and\nher uncertain hold on the bridle combined to produce disaster. He set\nhis foot upon a stone which slid beneath it, he stumbled, and she could\nnot help him to recover, so he fell, and only by Heaven's mercy not\nupon her, with his crushing, big-boned weight, and she was able to drag\nherself free of him before he began to kick, in his humiliated efforts\nto rise. But he could not rise, because he was hurt--and when she,\nherself, got up, she staggered, and caught at the broken gate, because\nin her wrenching leap for safety she had twisted her ankle, and for a\nmoment was in cruel pain.\n\nWhen she recovered from her shock sufficiently to be able to look at the\ncottage, she saw that it was more of a ruin than it had seemed, even\nat a short distance. Its door hung open on broken hinges, no smoke rose\nfrom the chimney, because there was no one within its walls to light\na fire. It was quite empty. Everything about the place lay in dead and\nutter silence. In a normal mood she would have liked the mystery of\nthe situation, and would have set about planning her way out of her\ndifficulty. But now her mind made no effort, because normal interest\nin things had fallen away from her. She might be twenty miles from\nStornham, but the possible fact did not, at the moment, seem to concern\nher. (Where is he now--where is he now?) Childe Harold was trying to\nrise, despite his hurt, and his evident determination touched her. He\nwas too proud to lie in the mire. She limped to him, and tried to steady\nhim by his bridle. He was not badly injured, though plainly in pain.\n\n\"Poor boy, it was my fault,\" she said to him as he at last struggled to\nhis feet. \"I did not know I was doing it. Poor boy!\"\n\nHe turned a velvet dark eye upon her, and nosed her forgivingly with\na warm velvet muzzle, but it was plain that, for the time, he was done\nfor. They both moved haltingly to the broken gate, and Betty fastened\nhim to a thorn tree near it, where he stood on three feet, his fine head\ndrooping.\n\nShe pushed the gate open, and went into the house through the door which\nhung on its hinges. Once inside, she stood still and looked about her.\nIf there was silence and desolateness outside, there was within the\ndeserted place a stillness like the unresponse of death. It had been\nlong since anyone had lived in the cottage, but tramps or gipsies had\nat times passed through it. Dead, blackened embers lay on the hearth, a\nbundle of dried grass which had been slept on was piled in the corner,\nan empty nail keg and a wooden box had been drawn before the big chimney\nplace for some wanderer to sit on when the black embers had been hot and\nred.\n\nBetty gave one glance around her and sat down upon the box standing on\nthe bare hearth, her head sinking forward, her hands falling clasped\nbetween her knees, her eyes on the brick floor.\n\n\"Where is he now?\" broke from her in a loud whisper, whose sound was\nmechanical and hollow. \"Where is he now?\"\n\nAnd she sat there without moving, while the grey mist from the marshes\ncrept close about the door and through it and stole about her feet.\n\nSo she sat long--long--in a heavy, far-off dream.\n\nAlong the road a man was riding with a lowering, fretted face. He had\ncome across country on horseback, because to travel by train meant\nwearisome stops and changes and endlessly slow journeying, annoying\nbeyond endurance to those who have not patience to spare. His ride would\nhave been pleasant enough but for the slow mist-like rain. Also he had\ntaken a wrong turning, because he did not know the roads he travelled.\nThe last signpost he had passed, however, had given him his cue again,\nand he began to feel something of security. Confound the rain! The best\nroad was slippery with it, and the haze of it made a man's mind feel\nbefogged and lowered his spirits horribly--discouraged him--would worry\nhim into an ill humour even if he had reason to be in a good one. As for\nhim, he had no reason for cheerfulness--he never had for the matter\nof that, and just now----! What was the matter with his horse? He was\nlifting his head and sniffing the damp air restlessly, as if he\nscented or saw something. Beasts often seemed to have a sort of second\nsight--horses particularly.\n\nWhat ailed him that he should prick up his ears and snort after his\nsniffing the mist! Did he hear anything? Yes, he did, it seemed. He gave\nforth suddenly a loud shrill whinny, turning his head towards a rough\nlane they were approaching, and immediately from the vicinity of\na deserted-looking cottage behind a hedge came a sharp but\nmournful-sounding neigh in answer.\n\n\"What horse is that?\" said Nigel Anstruthers, drawing in at the\nentrance to the lane and looking down it. \"There is a fine brute with a\nside-saddle on,\" he added sharply. \"He is waiting for someone. What is a\nwoman doing there at this time? Is it a rendezvous? A good place----\"\n\nHe broke off short and rode forward. \"I'm hanged if it is not Childe\nHarold,\" he broke out, and he had no sooner assured himself of the fact\nthan he threw himself from his saddle, tethered his horse and strode up\nthe path to the broken-hinged door.\n\nHe stood on the threshold and stared. What a hole it was--what a hole!\nAnd there SHE sat--alone--eighteen or twenty miles from home--on a\nturned-up box near the black embers, her hands clasped loosely between\nher knees, her face rather awful, her eyes staring at the floor, as if\nshe did not see it.\n\n\"Where is he now?\" he heard her whisper to herself with soft weirdness.\n\"Where is he now?\"\n\nSir Nigel stepped into the place and stood before her. He had smiled\nwith a wry unpleasantness when he had heard her evidently unconscious\nwords.\n\n\"My good girl,\" he said, \"I am sure I do not know where he is--but it\nis very evident that he ought to be here, since you have amiably put\nyourself to such trouble. It is fortunate for you perhaps that I am here\nbefore him. What does this mean?\" the question breaking from him with\nsavage authority.\n\nHe had dragged her back to earth. She sat upright and recognised him\nwith a hideous sense of shock, but he did not give her time to speak.\nHis instinct of male fury leaped within him.\n\n\"YOU!\" he cried out. \"It takes a woman like you to come and hide herself\nin a place of this sort, like a trolloping gipsy wench! It takes a New\nYork millionairess or a Roman empress or one of Charles the\nSecond's duchesses to plunge as deep as this. You, with your golden\npedestal--you, with your ostentatious airs and graces--you, with your\ncondescending to give a man a chance to repent his sins and turn over\na new leaf! Damn it,\" rising to a sort of frenzy, \"what are you doing\nwaiting in a hole like this--in this weather--at this hour--you--you!\"\n\nThe fool's flame leaped high enough to make him start forward, as if to\nseize her by the shoulder and shake her.\n\nBut she rose and stepped back to lean against the side of the\nchimney--to brace herself against it, so that she could stand in her\nlame foot's despite. Every drop of blood had been swept from her face,\nand her eyes looked immense. His coming was a good thing for her, though\nshe did not know it. It brought her back from unearthly places. All her\nchild hatred woke and blazed in her. Never had she hated a thing so, and\nit set her slow, cold blood running like something molten.\n\n\"Hold your tongue!\" she said in a clear, awful young voice of warning.\n\"And take care not to touch me. If you do--I have my whip here--I shall\nlash you across your mouth!\"\n\nHe broke into ribald laughter. A certain sudden thought which had cut\ninto him like a knife thrust into flesh drove him on.\n\n\"Do!\" he cried. \"I should like to carry your mark back to Stornham--and\ntell people why it was given. I know who you are here for. Only such\nfellows ask such things of women. But he was determined to be safe, if\nyou hid in a ditch. You are here for Mount Dunstan--and he has failed\nyou!\"\n\nBut she only stood and stared at him, holding her whip behind her,\nknowing that at any moment he might snatch it from her hand. And\nshe knew how poor a weapon it was. To strike out with it would only\ninfuriate him and make him a wild beast. And it was becoming an agony\nto stand upon her foot. And even if it had not been so--if she had been\nstrong enough to make a leap and dash past him, her horse stood outside\ndisabled.\n\nNigel Anstruthers' eyes ran over her from head to foot, down the side of\nher mud-stained habit, while a curious light dawned in them.\n\n\"You have had a fall from your horse,\" he exclaimed. \"You are lame!\"\nThen quickly, \"That was why Childe Harold was trembling and standing on\nthree feet! By Jove!\"\n\nThen he sat down on the nail keg and began to laugh. He laughed for a\nfull minute, but she saw he did not take his eyes from her.\n\n\"You are in as unpleasant a situation as a young woman can well be,\" he\nsaid, when he stopped. \"You came to a dirty hole to be alone with a man\nwho felt it safest not to keep his appointment. Your horse stumbled and\ndisabled himself and you. You are twenty miles from home in a deserted\ncottage in a lane no one passes down even in good weather. You are\nfrightened to death and you have given me even a better story to play\nwith than your sister gave me. By Jove!\"\n\nHis face was an unholy thing to look upon. The situation and her\npowerlessness were exciting him.\n\n\"No,\" she answered, keeping her eyes on his, as she might have kept them\non some wild animal's, \"I am not frightened to death.\"\n\nHis ugly dark flush rose.\n\n\"Well, if you are not,\" he said, \"don't tell me so. That kind of\ndefiance is not your best line just now. You have been disdaining me\nfrom magnificent New York heights for some time. Do you think that I am\nnot enjoying this?\"\n\n\"I cannot imagine anyone else who would enjoy it so much.\" And she knew\nthe answer was daring, but would have made it if he had held a knife's\npoint at her throat.\n\nHe got up, and walking to the door drew it back on its crazy hinges\nand managed to shut it close. There was a big wooden bolt inside and he\nforced it into its socket.\n\n\"Presently I shall go and put the horses into the cowshed,\" he said.\n\"If I leave them standing outside they will attract attention. I do\nnot intend to be disturbed by any gipsy tramp who wants shelter. I have\nnever had you quite to myself before.\"\n\nHe sat down again and nursed his knee gracefully.\n\n\"And I have never seen you look as attractive,\" biting his under lip\nin cynical enjoyment. \"To-day's adventure has roused your emotions and\nactually beautified you--which was not necessary. I daresay you have\nbeen furious and have cried. Your eyes do not look like mere eyes,\nbut like splendid blue pools of tears. Perhaps _I_ shall make you cry\nsometime, my dear Betty.\"\n\n\"No, you will not.\"\n\n\"Don't tempt me. Women always cry when men annoy them. They rage, but\nthey cry as well.\"\n\n\"I shall not.\"\n\n\"It's true that most women would have begun to cry before this. That is\nwhat stimulates me. You will swagger to the end. You put the devil into\nme. Half an hour ago I was jogging along the road, languid and bored to\nextinction. And now----\" He laughed outright in actual exultation. \"By\nJove!\" he cried out. \"Things like this don't happen to a man in these\ndull days! There's no such luck going about. We've gone back five\nhundred years, and we've taken New York with us.\" His laugh shut off in\nthe middle, and he got up to thrust his heavy, congested face close to\nhers. \"Here you are, as safe as if you were in a feudal castle, and here\nis your ancient enemy given his chance--given his chance. Do you think,\nby the Lord, he is going to give it up? No. To quote your own words,\n'you may place entire confidence in that.'\"\n\nExaggerated as it all was, somehow the melodrama dropped away from it\nand left bare, simple, hideous fact for her to confront. The evil in him\nhad risen rampant and made him lose his head. He might see his senseless\nfolly to-morrow and know he must pay for it, but he would not see\nit to-day. The place was not a feudal castle, but what he said was\ninsurmountable truth. A ruined cottage on the edge of miles of marsh\nland, a seldom-trodden road, and night upon them! A wind was rising\non the marshes now, and making low, steady moan. Horrible things had\nhappened to women before, one heard of them with shudders when they were\nrecorded in the newspapers. Only two days ago she had remembered that\nsometimes there seemed blunderings in the great Scheme of things. Was\nall this real, or was she dreaming that she stood here at bay, her back\nagainst the chimney-wall, and this degenerate exulting over her, while\nRosy was waiting for her at Stornham--and at this very hour her father\nwas planning his journey across the Atlantic?\n\n\"Why did you not behave yourself?\" demanded Nigel Anstruthers, shaking\nher by the shoulder. \"Why did you not realise that I should get even\nwith you one day, as sure as you were woman and I was man?\"\n\nShe did not shrink back, though the pupils of her eyes dilated. Was it\nthe wildest thing in the world which happened to her--or was it not?\nWithout warning--the sudden rush of a thought, immense and strange,\nswept over her body and soul and possessed her--so possessed her that\nit changed her pallor to white flame. It was actually Anstruthers\nwho shrank back a shade because, for the moment, she looked so near\nunearthly.\n\n\"I am not afraid of you,\" she said, in a clear, unshaken voice. \"I am\nnot afraid. Something is near me which will stand between us--something\nwhich DIED to-day.\"\n\nHe almost gasped before the strangeness of it, but caught back his\nbreath and recovered himself.\n\n\"Died to-day! That's recent enough,\" he jeered. \"Let us hear about it.\nWho was it?\"\n\n\"It was Mount Dunstan,\" she flung at him. \"The church-bells were tolling\nfor him when I rode away. I could not stay to hear them. It killed me--I\nloved him. You were right when you said it. I loved him, though he never\nknew. I shall always love him--though he never knew. He knows now.\nThose who died cannot go away when THAT is holding them. They must stay.\nBecause I loved him, he may be in this place. I call on him----\" raising\nher clear voice. \"I call on him to stand between us.\"\n\nHe backed away from her, staring an evil, enraptured stare.\n\n\"What! There is that much temperament in you?\" he said. \"That was what I\nhalf-suspected when I saw you first. But you have hidden it well. Now it\nbursts forth in spite of you. Good Lord! What luck--what luck!\"\n\nHe moved to the door and opened it.\n\n\"I am a very modern man, and I enjoy this to the utmost,\" he said. \"What\nI like best is the melodrama of it--in connection with Fifth Avenue.\nI am perfectly aware that you will not discuss this incident in the\nfuture. You are a clever enough young woman to know that it will be more\nto your interest than to mine that it shall be kept exceedingly quiet.\"\n\nThe white fire had not died out of her and she stood straight.\n\n\"What I have called on will be near me, and will stand between us,\" she\nsaid.\n\nOld though it was, the door was massive and heavy to lift. To open it\ncost him some muscular effort.\n\n\"I am going to the horses now,\" he explained before he dragged it back\ninto its frame and shut her in. \"It is safe enough to leave you here.\nYou will stay where you are.\"\n\nHe felt himself secure in leaving her because he believed she could not\nmove, and because his arrogance made it impossible for him to count\non strength and endurance greater than his own. Of endurance he knew\nnothing and in his keen and cynical exultance his devil made a fool of\nhim.\n\nAs she heard him walk down the path to the gate, Betty stood amazed at\nhis lack of comprehension of her.\n\n\"He thinks I will stay here. He absolutely thinks I will wait until he\ncomes back,\" she whispered to the emptiness of the bare room.\n\nBefore he had arrived she had loosened her boot, and now she stooped and\ntouched her foot.\n\n\"If I were safe at home I should think I could not walk, but I can walk\nnow--I can--I can--because I will bear the pain.\"\n\nIn such cottages there is always a door opening outside from the little\nbricked kitchen, where the copper stands. She would reach that, and,\npassing through, would close it behind her. After that SOMETHING would\ntell her what to do--something would lead her.\n\nShe put her lame foot upon the floor, and rested some of her weight upon\nit--not all. A jagged pain shot up from it through her whole side it\nseemed, and, for an instant, she swayed and ground her teeth.\n\n\"That is because it is the first step,\" she said. \"But if I am to be\nkilled, I will die in the open--I will die in the open.\"\n\nThe second and third steps brought cold sweat out upon her, but she told\nherself that the fourth was not quite so unbearable, and she stiffened\nher whole body, and muttered some words while she took a fifth and sixth\nwhich carried her into the tiny back kitchen.\n\n\"Father,\" she said. \"Father, think of me now--think of me! Rosy, love\nme--love me and pray that I may come home. You--you who have died, stand\nvery near!\"\n\nIf her father ever held her safe in his arms again--if she ever awoke\nfrom this nightmare, it would be a thing never to let one's mind hark\nback to again--to shut out of memory with iron doors.\n\nThe pain had shot up and down, and her forehead was wet by the time she\nhad reached the small back door. Was it locked or bolted--was it? She\nput her hand gently upon the latch and lifted it without making any\nsound. Thank God Almighty, it was neither bolted nor locked, the latch\nlifted, the door opened, and she slid through it into the shadow of the\ngrey which was already almost the darkness of night. Thank God for that,\ntoo.\n\nShe flattened herself against the outside wall and listened. He was\nhaving difficulty in managing Childe Harold, who snorted and pulled\nback, offended and made rebellious by his savagely impatient hand. Good\nChilde Harold, good boy! She could see the massed outline of the trees\nof the spinney. If she could bear this long enough to get there--even\nif she crawled part of the way. Then it darted through her mind that he\nwould guess that she would be sure to make for its cover, and that he\nwould go there first to search.\n\n\"Father, think for me--you were so quick to think!\" her brain cried out\nfor her, as if she was speaking to one who could physically hear.\n\nShe almost feared she had spoken aloud, and the thought which flashed\nupon her like lightning seemed to be an answer given. He would be\nconvinced that she would at once try to get away from the house. If she\nkept near it--somewhere--somewhere quite close, and let him search the\nspinney, she might get away to its cover after he gave up the search and\ncame back. The jagged pain had settled in a sort of impossible anguish,\nand once or twice she felt sick. But she would die in the open--and she\nknew Rosalie was frightened by her absence, and was praying for her.\nPrayers counted and, yet, they had all prayed yesterday.\n\n\"If I were not very strong, I should faint,\" she thought. \"But I have\nbeen strong all my life. That great French doctor--I have forgotten his\nname--said that I had the physique to endure anything.\"\n\nShe said these things that she might gain steadiness and convince\nherself that she was not merely living through a nightmare. Twice she\nmoved her foot suddenly because she found herself in a momentary respite\nfrom pain, beginning to believe that the thing was a nightmare--that\nnothing mattered--because she would wake up presently--so she need not\ntry to hide.\n\n\"But in a nightmare one has no pain. It is real and I must go\nsomewhere,\" she said, after the foot was moved. Where could she go?\nShe had not looked at the place as she rode up. She had only\nhalf-consciously seen the spinney. Nigel was swearing at the horses.\nHaving got Childe Harold into the shed, there seemed to be nothing\nto fasten his bridle to. And he had yet to bring his own horse in and\nsecure him. She must get away somewhere before the delay was over.\n\nHow dark it was growing! Thank God for that again! What was the rather\nhigh, dark object she could trace in the dimness near the hedge? It was\nsharply pointed, is if it were a narrow tent. Her heart began to beat\nlike a drum as she recalled something. It was the shape of the sort\nof wigwam structure made of hop poles, after they were taken from the\nfields. If there was space between it and the hedge--even a narrow\nspace--and she could crouch there? Nigel was furious because Childe\nHarold was backing, plunging, and snorting dangerously. She halted\nforward, shutting her teeth in her terrible pain. She could scarcely\nsee, and did not recognise that near the wigwam was a pile of hop poles\nlaid on top of each other horizontally. It was not quite as high as the\nhedge whose dark background prevented its being seen. Only a few steps\nmore. No, she was awake--in a nightmare one felt only terror, not pain.\n\n\"YOU, WHO DIED TO-DAY,\" she murmured.\n\nShe saw the horizontal poles too late. One of them had rolled from its\nplace and lay on the ground, and she trod on it, was thrown forward\nagainst the heap, and, in her blind effort to recover herself, slipped\nand fell into a narrow, grassed hollow behind it, clutching at the\nhedge. The great French doctor had not been quite right. For the\nfirst time in her life she felt herself sinking into bottomless\ndarkness--which was what happened to people when they fainted.\n\nWhen she opened her eyes she could see nothing, because on one side\nof her rose the low mass of the hop poles, and on the other was the\nlong-untrimmed hedge, which had thrown out a thick, sheltering growth\nand curved above her like a penthouse. Was she awakening, after all? No,\nbecause the pain was awakening with her, and she could hear, what seemed\nat first to be quite loud sounds. She could not have been unconscious\nlong, for she almost immediately recognised that they were the echo of\na man's hurried footsteps upon the bare wooden stairway, leading to\nthe bedrooms in the empty house. Having secured the horses, Nigel had\nreturned to the cottage, and, finding her gone had rushed to the upper\nfloor in search of her. He was calling her name angrily, his voice\nresounding in the emptiness of the rooms.\n\n\"Betty; don't play the fool with me!\"\n\nShe cautiously drew herself further under cover, making sure that no\nend of her habit remained in sight. The overgrowth of the hedge was\nher salvation. If she had seen the spot by daylight, she would not have\nthought it a possible place of concealment.\n\nOnce she had read an account of a woman's frantic flight from a murderer\nwho was hunting her to her death, while she slipped from one poor hiding\nplace to another, sometimes crouching behind walls or bushes, sometimes\nlying flat in long grass, once wading waist-deep through a stream, and\nat last finding a miserable little fastness, where she hid shivering for\nhours, until her enemy gave up his search. One never felt the reality of\nsuch histories, but there was actually a sort of parallel in this. Mad\nand crude things were let loose, and the world of ordinary life seemed\nthousands of miles away.\n\nShe held her breath, for he was leaving the house by the front door. She\nheard his footsteps on the bricked path, and then in the lane. He went\nto the road, and the sound of his feet died away for a few moments. Then\nshe heard them returning--he was back in the lane--on the brick path,\nand stood listening or, perhaps, reflecting. He muttered something\nexclamatory, and she heard a match struck, and shortly afterwards he\nmoved across the garden patch towards the little spinney. He had thought\nof it, as she had believed he would. He would not think of this place,\nand in the end he might get tired or awakened to a sense of his lurid\nfolly, and realise that it would be safer for him to go back to Stornham\nwith some clever lie, trusting to his belief that there existed no girl\nbut would shrink from telling such a story in connection with a man who\nwould brazenly deny it with contemptuous dramatic detail. If he would\nbut decide on this, she would be safe--and it would be so like him that\nshe dared to hope. But, if he did not, she would lie close, even if she\nmust wait until morning, when some labourer's cart would surely pass,\nand she would hear it jolting, and drag herself out, and call aloud\nin such a way that no man could be deaf. There was more room under her\nhedge than she had thought, and she found that she could sit up, by\nclasping her knees and bending her head, while she listened to every\nsound, even to the rustle of the grass in the wind sweeping across the\nmarsh.\n\nShe moved very gradually and slowly, and had just settled into utter\nmotionlessness when she realised that he was coming back through the\ngarden--the straggling currant and gooseberry bushes were being trampled\nthrough.\n\n\"Betty, go home,\" Rosalie had pleaded. \"Go home--go home.\" And she had\nrefused, because she could not desert her.\n\nShe held her breath and pressed her hand against her side, because her\nheart beat, as it seemed to her, with an actual sound. He moved with\nunsteady steps from one point to another, more than once he stumbled,\nand his angry oath reached her; at last he was so near her hiding place\nthat his short hard breathing was a distinct sound. A moment later he\nspoke, raising his voice, which fact brought to her a rush of relief,\nthrough its signifying that he had not even guessed her nearness.\n\n\"My dear Betty,\" he said, \"you have the pluck of the devil, but\ncircumstances are too much for you. You are not on the road, and I have\nbeen through the spinney. Mere logic convinces me that you cannot be far\naway. You may as well give the thing up. It will be better for you.\"\n\n\"You who died to-day--do not leave me,\" was Betty's inward cry, and she\ndropped her face on her knees.\n\n\"I am not a pleasant-tempered fellow, as you know, and I am losing my\nhold on myself. The wind is blowing the mist away, and there will be a\nmoon. I shall find you, my good girl, in half an hour's time--and then\nwe shall be jolly well even.\"\n\nShe had not dropped her whip, and she held it tight. If, when the\nmoonlight revealed the pile of hop poles to him, he suspected and sprang\nat them to tear them away, she would be given strength to make one\nspring, even in her agony, and she would strike at his eyes--awfully,\nwithout one touch of compunction--she would strike--strike.\n\nThere was a brief silence, and then a match was struck again, and almost\nimmediately she inhaled the fragrance of an excellent cigar.\n\n\"I am going to have a comfortable smoke and stroll about--always within\nsight and hearing. I daresay you are watching me, and wondering what\nwill happen when I discover you, I can tell you what will happen. You\nare not a hysterical girl, but you will go into hysterics--and no one\nwill hear you.\"\n\n(All the power of her--body and soul--in one leap on him and then a lash\nthat would cut to the bone. And it was not a nightmare--and Rosy was\nat Stornham, and her father looking over steamer lists and choosing his\nstaterooms.)\n\nHe walked about slowly, the scent of his cigar floating behind him.\nShe noticed, as she had done more than once before, that he seemed to\nslightly drag one foot, and she wondered why. The wind was blowing the\nmist away, and there was a faint growing of light. The moon was not\nfull, but young, and yet it would make a difference. But the upper part\nof the hedge grew thick and close to the heap of wood, and, but for her\nfall, she would never have dreamed of the refuge.\n\nShe could only guess at his movements, but his footsteps gave some clue.\nHe was examining the ground in as far as the darkness would allow. He\nwent into the shed and round about it, he opened the door of the tiny\ncoal lodge, and looked again into the small back kitchen. He came\nnear--nearer--so near once that, bending sidewise, she could have put\nout a hand and touched him. He stood quite still, then made a step or so\naway, stood still again, and burst into a laugh once more.\n\n\"Oh, you are here, are you?\" he said. \"You are a fine big girl to be\nable to crowd yourself into a place like that!\"\n\nHot and cold dew stood out on her forehead and made her hair damp as she\nheld her whip hard.\n\n\"Come out, my dear!\" alluringly. \"It is not too soon. Or do you prefer\nthat I should assist you?\"\n\nHer heart stood quite still--quite. He was standing by the wigwam of hop\npoles and thought she had hidden herself inside it. Her place under the\nhedge he had not even glanced at.\n\nShe knew he bent down and thrust his arm into the wigwam, for his fury\nat the result expressed itself plainly enough. That he had made a fool\nof himself was worse to him than all else. He actually wheeled about and\nstrode away to the house.\n\nBecause minutes seemed hours, she thought he was gone long, but he was\nnot away for twenty minutes. He had, in fact, gone into the bare front\nroom again, and sitting upon the box near the hearth, let his head drop\nin his hands and remained in this position thinking. In the end he got\nup and went out to the shed where he had left the horses.\n\nBetty was feeling that before long she might find herself making that\nstrange swoop into the darkness of space again, and that it did\nnot matter much, as one apparently lay quite still when one was\nunconscious--when she heard that one horse was being led out into the\nlane. What did that mean? Had he got tired of the chase--as the other\nman did--and was he going away because discomfort and fatigue had cooled\nand disgusted him--perhaps even made him feel that he was playing the\npart of a sensational idiot who was laying himself open to derision?\nThat would be like him, too.\n\nPresently she heard his footsteps once more, but he did not come as near\nher as before--in fact, he stood at some yards' distance when he stopped\nand spoke--in quite a new manner.\n\n\"Betty,\" his tone was even cynically cool, \"I shall stalk you no more.\nThe chase is at an end. I think I have taken all out of you I intended\nto. Perhaps it was a bad joke and was carried too far. I wanted to prove\nto you that there were circumstances which might be too much even for\na young woman from New York. I have done it. Do you suppose I am such\na fool as to bring myself within reach of the law? I am going away and\nwill send assistance to you from the next house I pass. I have left\nsome matches and a few broken sticks on the hearth in the cottage. Be\na sensible girl. Limp in there and build yourself a fire as soon as you\nhear me gallop away. You must be chilled through. Now I am going.\"\n\nHe tramped across the bit of garden, down the brick path, mounted his\nhorse and put it to a gallop at once. Clack, clack, clack--clacking\nfainter and fainter into the distance--and he was gone.\n\nWhen she realised that the thing was true, the effect upon her of her\nsense of relief was that the growing likelihood of a second swoop into\ndarkness died away, but one curious sob lifted her chest as she leaned\nback against the rough growth behind her. As she changed her position\nfor a better one she felt the jagged pain again and knew that in the\ntenseness of her terror she had actually for some time felt next to\nnothing of her hurt. She had not even been cold, for the hedge behind\nand over her and the barricade before had protected her from both wind\nand rain. The grass beneath her was not damp for the same reason. The\nweary thought rose in her mind that she might even lie down and sleep.\nBut she pulled herself together and told herself that this was like the\ntemptation of believing in the nightmare. He was gone, and she had a\nrespite--but was it to be anything more? She did not make any attempt to\nleave her place of concealment, remembering the strange things she had\nlearned in watching him, and the strange terror in which Rosalie lived.\n\n\"One never knows what he will do next; I will not stir,\" she said\nthrough her teeth. \"No, I will not stir from here.\"\n\nAnd she did not, but sat still, while the pain came back to her body\nand the anguish to her heart--and sometimes such heaviness that her\nhead dropped forward upon her knees again, and she fell into a stupefied\nhalf-doze.\n\nFrom one such doze she awakened with a start, hearing a slight click of\nthe gate. After it, there were several seconds of dead silence. It was\nthe slightness of the click which was startling--if it had not been\ncaused by the wind, it had been caused by someone's having cautiously\nmoved it--and this someone wishing to make a soundless approach had\nimmediately stood still and was waiting. There was only one person who\nwould do that. By this time, the mist being blown away, the light of\nthe moon began to make a growing clearness. She lifted her hand and\ndelicately held aside a few twigs that she might look out.\n\nShe had been quite right in deciding not to move. Nigel Anstruthers\nhad come back, and after his pause turned, and avoiding the brick path,\nstole over the grass to the cottage door. His going had merely been an\ninspiration to trap her, and the wood and matches had been intended to\nmake a beacon light for him. That was like him, as well. His horse he\nhad left down the road.\n\nBut the relief of his absence had been good for her, and she was able\nto check the shuddering fit which threatened her for a moment. The next,\nher ears awoke to a new sound. Something was stumbling heavily about the\npatch of garden--some animal. A cropping of grass, a snorting breath,\nand more stumbling hoofs, and she knew that Childe Harold had managed\nto loosen his bridle and limp out of the shed. The mere sense of his\nnearness seemed a sort of protection.\n\nHe had limped and stumbled to the front part of the garden before Nigel\nheard him. When he did hear, he came out of the house in the humour of\na man the inflaming of whose mood has been cumulative; Childe Harold's\ntemper also was not to be trifled with. He threw up his head, swinging\nthe bridle out of reach; he snorted, and even reared with an ugly\nlashing of his forefeet.\n\n\"Good boy!\" whispered Betty. \"Do not let him take you--do not!\"\n\nIf he remained where he was he would attract attention if anyone passed\nby. \"Fight, Childe Harold, be as vicious as you choose--do not allow\nyourself to be dragged back.\"\n\nAnd fight he did, with an ugliness of temper he had never shown\nbefore--with snortings and tossed head and lashed-out heels, as if he\nknew he was fighting to gain time and with a purpose.\n\nBut in the midst of the struggle Nigel Anstruthers stopped suddenly. He\nhad stumbled again, and risen raging and stained with damp earth. Now\nhe stood still, panting for breath--as still as he had stood after the\nclick of the gate. Was he--listening? What was he listening to? Had she\nmoved in her excitement, and was it possible he had caught the sound?\nNo, he was listening to something else. Far up the road it echoed,\nbut coming nearer every moment, and very fast. Another horse--a big\none--galloping hard. Whosoever it was would pass this place; it could\nonly be a man--God grant that he would not go by so quickly that his\nattention would not be arrested by a shriek! Cry out she must--and if\nhe did not hear and went galloping on his way she would have betrayed\nherself and be lost.\n\nShe bit off a groan by biting her lip.\n\n\"You who died to-day--now--now!\"\n\nNearer and nearer. No human creature could pass by a thing like this--it\nwould not be possible. And Childe Harold, backing and fighting, scented\nthe other horse and neighed fiercely and high. The rider was slackening\nhis pace; he was near the lane. He had turned into it and stopped. Now\nfor her one frantic cry--but before she could gather power to give it\nforth, the man who had stopped had flung himself from his saddle and was\ninside the garden speaking. A big voice and a clear one, with a ringing\ntone of authority.\n\n\"What are you doing here? And what is the matter with Miss Vanderpoel's\nhorse?\" it called out.\n\nNow there was danger of the swoop into the darkness--great\ndanger--though she clutched at the hedge that she might feel its thorns\nand hold herself to the earth.\n\n\"YOU!\" Nigel Anstruthers cried out. \"You!\" and flung forth a shout of\nlaughter.\n\n\"Where is she?\" fiercely. \"Lady Anstruthers is terrified. We have been\nsearching for hours. Only just now I heard on the marsh that she had\nbeen seen to ride this way. Where is she, I say?\"\n\nA strong, angry, earthly voice--not part of the melodrama--not part of a\ndream, but a voice she knew, and whose sound caused her heart to leap\nto her throat, while she trembled from head to foot, and a light, cold\ndampness broke forth on her skin. Something had been a dream--her wild,\ndesolate ride--the slow tolling; for the voice which commanded with such\nhuman fierceness was that of the man for whom the heavy bell had struck\nforth from the church tower.\n\nSir Nigel recovered himself brilliantly. Not that he did not recognise\nthat he had been a fool again and was in a nasty place; but it was not\nfor the first time in his life, and he had learned how to brazen himself\nout of nasty places.\n\n\"My dear Mount Dunstan,\" he answered with tolerant irritation, \"I have\nbeen having a devil of a time with female hysterics. She heard the bell\ntoll and ran away with the idea that it was for you, and paid you the\ncompliment of losing her head. I came on her here when she had ridden\nher horse half to death and they had both come a cropper. Confound\nwomen's hysterics! I could do nothing with her. When I left her for a\nmoment she ran away and hid herself. She is concealed somewhere on\nthe place or has limped off on to the marsh. I wish some New York\nmillionairess would work herself into hysteria on my humble account.\"\n\n\"Those are lies,\" Mount Dunstan answered--\"every damned one of them!\"\n\nHe wheeled around to look about him, attracted by a sound, and in the\nclearing moonlight saw a figure approaching which might have risen from\nthe earth, so far as he could guess where it had come from. He strode\nover to it, and it was Betty Vanderpoel, holding her whip in a clenched\nhand and showing to his eagerness such hunted face and eyes as were\nbarely human. He caught her unsteadiness to support it, and felt her\nfingers clutch at the tweed of his coatsleeve and move there as if the\nmere feeling of its rough texture brought heavenly comfort to her and\ngave her strength.\n\n\"Yes, they are lies, Lord Mount Dunstan,\" she panted. \"He said that he\nmeant to get what he called 'even' with me. He told me I could not get\naway from him and that no one would hear me if I cried out for help. I\nhave hidden like some hunted animal.\" Her shaking voice broke, and she\nheld the cloth of his sleeve tightly. \"You are alive--alive!\" with a\nsudden sweet wildness. \"But it is true the bell tolled! While I was\ncrouching in the dark I called to you--who died to-day--to stand between\nus!\"\n\nThe man absolutely shuddered from head to foot.\n\n\"I was alive, and you see I heard you and came,\" he answered hoarsely.\n\nHe lifted her in his arms and carried her into the cottage. Her cheek\nfelt the enrapturing roughness of his tweed shoulder as he did it. He\nlaid her down on the couch of hay and turned away.\n\n\"Don't move,\" he said. \"I will come back. You are safe.\"\n\nIf there had been more light she would have seen that his jaw was set\nlike a bulldog's, and there was a red spark in his eyes--a fearsome one.\nBut though she did not clearly see, she KNEW, and the nearness of the\nlast hours swept away all relenting.\n\nNigel Anstruthers having discreetly waited until the two had passed into\nthe house, and feeling that a man would be an idiot who did not remove\nhimself from an atmosphere so highly charged, was making his way toward\nthe lane and was, indeed, halfway through the gate when heavy feet were\nbehind him and a grip of ugly strength wrenched him backward.\n\n\"Your horse is cropping the grass where you left him, but you are not\ngoing to him,\" said a singularly meaning voice. \"You are coming with\nme.\"\n\nAnstruthers endeavoured to convince himself that he did not at that\nmoment turn deadly sick and that the brute would not make an ass of\nhimself.\n\n\"Don't be a bally fool!\" he cried out, trying to tear himself free.\n\nThe muscular hand on his shoulder being reinforced by another, which\nclutched his collar, dragged him back, stumbling ignominiously through\nthe gooseberry bushes towards the cart-shed. Betty lying upon her bed of\nhay heard the scuffling, mingled with raging and gasping curses. Childe\nHarold, lifting his head from his cropping of the grass, looked after\nthe violently jerking figures and snorted slightly, snuffing with\ndilated red nostrils. As a war horse scenting blood and battle, he was\nexcited.\n\nWhen Mount Dunstan got his captive into the shed the blood which had\nsurged in Red Godwyn's veins was up and leaping. Anstruthers, his collar\nheld by a hand with fingers of iron, writhed about and turned a livid,\nghastly face upon his captor.\n\n\"You have twice my strength and half my age, you beast and devil!\" he\nfoamed in a half shriek, and poured forth frightful blasphemies.\n\n\"That counts between man and man, but not between vermin and\nexecutioner,\" gave back Mount Dunstan.\n\nThe heavy whip, flung upward, whistled down through the air, cutting\nthrough cloth and linen as though it would cut through flesh to bone.\n\n\"By God!\" shrieked the writhing thing he held, leaping like a man who\nhas been shot. \"Don't do that again! DAMN you!\" as the unswerving lash\ncut down again--again.\n\nWhat followed would not be good to describe. Betty through the open door\nheard wild and awful things--and more than once a sound as if a dog were\nhowling.\n\nWhen the thing was over, one of the two--his clothes cut to ribbons,\nhis torn white linen exposed, lay, a writhing, huddled worm, hiccoughing\nfrenzied sobs upon the earth in a corner of the cart-shed. The other man\nstood over him, breathless and white, but singularly exalted.\n\n\"You won't want your horse to-night, because you can't use him,\" he\nsaid. \"I shall put Miss Vanderpoel's saddle upon him and ride with her\nback to Stornham. You think you are cut to pieces, but you are not, and\nyou'll get over it. I'll ask you to mark, however, that if you open your\nfoul mouth to insinuate lies concerning either Lady Anstruthers or her\nsister I will do this thing again in public some day--on the steps of\nyour club--and do it more thoroughly.\"\n\nHe walked into the cottage soon afterwards looking, to Betty\nVanderpoel's eyes, pale and exceptionally big, and also more a man than\nit is often given even to the most virile male creature to look--and he\nwalked to the side of her resting place and stood there looking down.\n\n\"I thought I heard a dog howl,\" she said.\n\n\"You did hear a dog howl,\" he answered. He said no other word, and she\nasked no further question. She knew what he had done, and he was well\naware that she knew it.\n\nThere was a long, strangely tense silence. The light of the moon was\ngrowing. She made at first no effort to rise, but lay still and looked\nup at him from under splendid lifted lashes, while his own gaze fell\ninto the depth of hers like a plummet into a deep pool. This continued\nfor almost a full minute, when he turned quickly away and walked to the\nhearth, indrawing a heavy breath.\n\nHe could not endure that which beset him; it was unbearable, because her\neyes had maddeningly seemed to ask him some wistful question. Why did\nshe let her loveliness so call to him. She was not a trifler who\ncould play with meanings. Perhaps she did not know what her power was.\nSometimes he could believe that beautiful women did not.\n\nIn a few moments, almost before he could reach her, she was rising, and\nwhen she got up she supported herself against the open door, standing\nin the moonlight. If he was pale, she was pale also, and her large eyes\nwould not move from his face, so drawing him that he could not keep away\nfrom her.\n\n\"Listen,\" he broke out suddenly. \"Penzance told me--warned me--that\nsome time a moment would come which would be stronger than all else in a\nman--than all else in the world. It has come now. Let me take you home.\"\n\n\"Than what else?\" she said slowly, and became even paler than before.\n\nHe strove to release himself from the possession of the moment, and in\nhis struggle answered with a sort of savagery.\n\n\"Than scruple--than power--even than a man's determination and decent\npride.\"\n\n\"Are you proud?\" she half whispered quite brokenly. \"I am not--since I\nwaited for the ringing of the church bell--since I heard it toll. After\nthat the world was empty--and it was as empty of decent pride as of\neverything else. There was nothing left. I was the humblest broken thing\non earth.\"\n\n\"You!\" he gasped. \"Do you know I think I shall go mad directly perhaps\nit is happening now. YOU were humble and broken--your world was empty!\nBecause----?\"\n\n\"Look at me, Lord Mount Dunstan,\" and the sweetest voice in the world\nwas a tender, wild little cry to him. \"Oh LOOK at me!\"\n\nHe caught her out-thrown hands and looked down into the beautiful\npassionate soul of her. The moment had come, and the tidal wave rising\nto its height swept all the common earth away when, with a savage sob,\nhe caught and held her close and hard against that which thudded racing\nin his breast.\n\nAnd they stood and swayed together, folded in each other's arms, while\nthe wind from the marshes lifted its voice like an exulting human thing\nas it swept about them.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIX\n\nAT STORNHAM AND AT BROADMORLANDS\n\nThe exulting wind had swept the clouds away, and the moon rode in a dark\nblue sea of sky, making the night light purely clear, when they drew\na little apart, that they might better see the wonderfulness in each\nother's faces. It was so mysteriously great a thing that they felt near\nto awe.\n\n\"I fought too long. I wore out my body's endurance, and now I am quaking\nlike a boy. Red Godwyn did not begin his wooing like this. Forgive me,\"\nMount Dunstan said at last.\n\n\"Do you know,\" with lovely trembling lips and voice, \"that for\nlong--long--you have been unkind to me?\"\n\nIt was merely human that he should swiftly enfold her again, and answer\nwith his lips against her cheek.\n\n\"Unkind! Unkind! Oh, the heavenly woman's sweetness of your telling me\nso--the heavenly sweetness of it!\" he exclaimed passionately and\nlow. \"And I was one of those who are 'by the roadside everywhere,' an\nunkempt, raging beggar, who might not decently ask you for a crust.\"\n\n\"It was all wrong--wrong!\" she whispered back to him, and he poured\nforth the tenderest, fierce words of confession and prayer, and she\nlistened, drinking them in, with now and then a soft sob pressed against\nthe roughness of the enrapturing tweed. For a space they had both\nforgotten her hurt, because there are other things than terror which\nhypnotise pain. Mount Dunstan was to be praised for remembering it\nfirst. He must take her back to Stornham and her sister without further\ndelay.\n\n\"I will put your saddle on Anstruthers' horse, or mine, and lift you to\nyour seat. There is a farmhouse about two miles away, where I will take\nyou first for food and warmth. Perhaps it would be well for you to\nstay there to rest for an hour or so, and I will send a message to Lady\nAnstruthers.\"\n\n\"I will go to the place, and eat and drink what you advise,\" she\nanswered. \"But I beg you to take me back to Rosalie without delay. I\nfeel that I must see her.\"\n\n\"I feel that I must see her, too,\" he said. \"But for her--God bless\nher!\" he added, after his sudden pause.\n\nBetty knew that the exclamation meant strong feeling, and that somehow\nin the past hours Rosalie had awakened it. But it was only when, after\ntheir refreshment at the farm, they had taken horse again and were\nriding homeward together, that she heard from him what had passed\nbetween them.\n\n\"All that has led to this may seem the merest chance,\" he said. \"But\nsurely a strange thing has come about. I know that without understanding\nit.\" He leaned over and touched her hand. \"You, who are Life--without\nunderstanding I ride here beside you, believing that you brought me\nback.\"\n\n\"I tried--I tried! With all my strength, I tried.\"\n\n\"After I had seen your sister to-day, I guessed--I knew. But not at\nfirst. I was not ill of the fever, as excited rumour had it; but I was\nill, and the doctors and the vicar were alarmed. I had fought too long,\nand I was giving up, as I have seen the poor fellows in the ballroom\ngive up. If they were not dragged back they slipped out of one's hands.\nIf the fever had developed, all would have been over quickly. I knew\nthe doctors feared that, and I am ashamed to say I was glad of it. But,\nyesterday, in the morning, when I was letting myself go with a morbid\npleasure in the luxurious relief of it--something reached me--some slow\nrising call to effort and life.\"\n\nShe turned towards him in her saddle, listening, her lips parted.\n\n\"I did not even ask myself what was happening, but I began to be\nconscious of being drawn back, and to long intensely to see you again. I\nwas gradually filled with a restless feeling that you were near me, and\nthat, though I could not physically hear your voice, you were surely\nCALLING to me. It was the thing which could not be--but it was--and\nbecause of it I could not let myself drift.\"\n\n\"I did call you! I was on my knees in the church asking to be forgiven\nif I prayed mad prayers--but praying the same thing over and over. The\nvillagers were kneeling there, too. They crowded in, leaving everything\nelse. You are their hero, and they were in deep earnest.\"\n\nHis look was gravely pondering. His life had not made a mystic of\nhim--it was Penzance who was the mystic--but he felt himself perplexed\nby mysteriously suggestive thought.\n\n\"I was brought back--I was brought back,\" he said. \"In the afternoon\nI fell asleep and slept profoundly until the morning. When I awoke, I\nrealised that I was a remade man. The doctors were almost awed when I\nfirst spoke to them. Old Dr. Fenwick died later, and, after I had\nheard about it, the church bell was tolled. It was heard at Weaver's\nfarmhouse, and, as everybody had been excitedly waiting for the sound,\nit conveyed but one idea to them--and the boy was sent racing across the\nfields to Stornham village. Dearest! Dearest!\" he exclaimed.\n\nShe had bowed her head and burst into passionate sobbing. Because she\nwas not of the women who wept, her moment's passion was strong and\nbitter.\n\n\"It need not have been!\" she shuddered. \"One cannot bear it--because it\nneed not have been!\"\n\n\"Stop your horse a moment,\" he said, reining in his own, while, with\nburning eyes and swelling throat, he held and steadied her. But he did\nnot know that neither her sister nor her father had ever seen her in\nsuch mood, and that she had never so seen herself.\n\n\"You shall not remember it,\" he said to her.\n\n\"I will not,\" she answered, recovering herself. \"But for one moment all\nthe awful hours rushed back. Tell me the rest.\"\n\n\"We did not know that the blunder had been made until a messenger from\nDole rode over to inquire and bring messages of condolence. Then we\nunderstood what had occurred and I own a sort of frenzy seized me. I\nknew I must see you, and, though the doctors were horribly nervous, they\ndare not hold me back. The day before it would not have been believed\nthat I could leave my room. You were crying out to me, and though I did\nnot know, I was answering, body and soul. Penzance knew I must have my\nway when I spoke to him--mad as it seemed. When I rode through Stornham\nvillage, more than one woman screamed at sight of me. I shall not be\nable to blot out of my mind your sister's face. She will tell you what\nwe said to each other. I rode away from the Court quite half mad----\"\nhis voice became very gentle, \"because of something she had told me in\nthe first wild moments.\"\n\nLady Anstruthers had spent the night moving restlessly from one room\nto another, and had not been to bed when they rode side by side up the\navenue in the early morning sunlight. An under keeper, crossing the\npark a few hundred yards above them, after one glance, dashed across\nthe sward to the courtyard and the servants' hall. The news flashed\nelectrically through the house, and Rosalie, like a small ghost, came\nout upon the steps as they reined in. Though her lips moved, she could\nnot speak aloud, as she watched Mount Dunstan lift her sister from her\nhorse.\n\n\"Childe Harold stumbled and I hurt my foot,\" said Betty, trying to be\ncalm.\n\n\"I knew he would find you!\" Rosalie answered quite faintly. \"I knew you\nwould!\" turning to Mount Dunstan, adoring him with all the meaning of\nher small paled face.\n\nShe would have been afraid of her memory of what she had said in the\nstrange scene which had taken place before them a few hours ago, but\nalmost before either of the two spoke she knew that a great gulf had\nbeen crossed in some one inevitable, though unforeseen, leap. How it had\nbeen taken, when or where, did not in the least matter, when she clung\nto Betty and Betty clung to her.\n\nAfter a few moments of moved and reverent waiting, the admirable\nJennings stepped forward and addressed her in lowered voice.\n\n\"There's been little sleep in the village this night, my lady,\" he\nmurmured earnestly. \"I promised they should have a sign, with your\npermission. If the flag was run up--they're all looking out, and they'd\nknow.\"\n\n\"Run it up, Jennings,\" Lady Anstruthers answered, \"at once.\"\n\nWhen it ran up the staff on the tower and fluttered out in gay answering\nto the morning breeze, children in the village began to run about\nshouting, men and women appeared at cottage doors, and more than one\ncap was thrown up in the air. But old Doby and Mrs. Welden, who had been\nwaiting for hours, standing by Mrs. Welden's gate, caught each other's\ndry, trembling old hands and began to cry.\n\nThe Broadmorlands divorce scandal, having made conversation during a\nseason quite forty years before Miss Vanderpoel appeared at Stornham\nCourt, had been laid upon a lower shelf and buried beneath other stories\nlong enough to be forgotten. Only one individual had not forgotten it,\nand he was the Duke of Broadmorlands himself, in whose mind it remained\nhideously clear. He had been a young man, honestly and much in love\nwhen it first revealed itself to him, and for a few months he had even\nthought it might end by being his death, notwithstanding that he was\nstrong and in first-rate physical condition. He had been a fine,\nhearty young man of clean and rather dignified life, though he was not\nunderstood to be brilliant of mind. Privately he had ideals connected\nwith his rank and name which he was not fluent enough clearly to\nexpress. After he had realised that he should not die of the public\nhumiliation and disgrace, which seemed to point him out as having been\nthe kind of gullible fool it is scarcely possible to avoid laughing\nat--or, so it seemed to him in his heart-seared frenzy--he thought it\nnot improbable that he should go mad. He was harried so by memories of\nlovely little soft ways of Edith's (his wife's name was Edith), of\nthe pretty sound of her laugh, and of her innocent, girlish habit of\nkneeling down by her bedside every night and morning to say her prayers.\nThis had so touched him that he had sometimes knelt down to say his,\ntoo, saying to her, with slight awkward boyishness, that a fellow who\nhad a sort of angel for his wife ought to do his best to believe in the\nthings she believed in.\n\n\"And all the time----!\" a devil who laughed used to snigger in his ear\nover and over again, until it was almost like the ticking of a clock\nduring the worst months, when it did not seem probable that a man could\nfeel his brain whirling like a Catherine wheel night and day, and still\nmanage to hold on and not reach the point of howling and shrieking and\ndashing his skull against wails and furniture.\n\nBut that passed in time, and he told himself that he passed with it.\nSince then he had lived chiefly at Broadmorlands Castle, and was spoken\nof as a man who had become religious, which was not true, but, having\nreached the decision that religion was good for most people, he paid a\ngood deal of attention to his church and schools, and was rigorous in\nthe matter of curates.\n\nHe had passed seventy now, and was somewhat despotic and haughty,\nbecause a man who is a Duke and does not go out into the world to rub\nagainst men of his own class and others, but lives altogether on a great\nand splendid estate, saluted by every creature he meets, and universally\nobeyed and counted before all else, is not unlikely to forget that he is\na quite ordinary human being, and not a sort of monarch.\n\nHe had done his best to forget Edith, who had soon died of being a shady\ncurate's wife in Australia, but he had not been able to encompass it. He\nused, occasionally, to dream she was kneeling by the bed in her childish\nnightgown saying her prayers aloud, and would waken crying--as he had\ncried in those awful young days. Against social immorality or village\nlight-mindedness he was relentlessly savage. He allowed for no\npalliating or exonerating facts. He began to see red when he heard of or\nsaw lightness in a married woman, and the outside world frequently said\nthat this characteristic bordered on monomania.\n\nNigel Anstruthers, having met him once or twice, had at first been much\namused by him, and had even, by giving him an adroitly careful lead,\nmanaged to guide him into an expression of opinion. The Duke, who\nhad heard men of his class discussed, did not in the least like him,\nnotwithstanding his sympathetic suavity of manner and his air of being\nintelligently impressed by what he heard. Not long afterwards, however,\nit transpired that the aged rector of Broadmorlands having died, the\nliving had been given to Ffolliott, and, hearing it, Sir Nigel was not\nslow to conjecture that quite decently utilisable tools would lie ready\nto his hand if circumstances pressed; this point of view, it will be\nseen, being not illogical. A man who had not been a sort of hermit would\nhave heard enough of him to be put on his guard, and one who was a man\nof the world, looking normally on existence, would have reasoned coolly,\nand declined to concern himself about what was not his affair. But a\nparallel might be drawn between Broadmorlands and some old lion wounded\nsorely in his youth and left to drag his unhealed torment through the\nyears of age. On one subject he had no point of view but his own,\nand could be roused to fury almost senseless by wholly inadequately\nsupported facts. He presented exactly the material required--and that in\nmass.\n\nAbout the time the flag was run up on the tower at Stornham Court a\ncarter, driving whistling on the road near the deserted cottage, was\nhailed by a man who was walking slowly a few yards ahead of him. The\ncarter thought that he was a tramp, as his clothes were plainly in\nbad case, which seeing, his answer was an unceremonious grunt, and it\ncertainly did not occur to him to touch his forehead. A minute later,\nhowever, he \"got a start,\" as he related afterwards. The tramp was a\ngentleman whose riding costume was torn and muddied, and who looked\n\"gashly,\" though he spoke with the manner and authority which Binns,\nthe carter, recognised as that of one of the \"gentry\" addressing a\nday-labourer.\n\n\"How far is it from here to Medham?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Medham be about four mile, sir,\" was the answer. \"I be carryin' these\n'taters there to market.\"\n\n\"I want to get there. I have met with an accident. My horse took fright\nat a pheasant starting up rocketting under his nose. He threw me into a\nhedge and bolted. I'm badly enough bruised to want to reach a town and\nsee a doctor. Can you give me a lift?\"\n\n\"That I will, sir, ready enough,\" making room on the seat beside him.\n\"You be bruised bad, sir,\" he said sympathetically, as his passenger\nclimbed to his place, with a twisted face and uttering blasphemies under\nhis breath.\n\n\"Damned badly,\" he answered. \"No bones broken, however.\"\n\n\"That cut on your cheek and neck'll need plasterin', sir.\"\n\n\"That's a scratch. Thorn bush,\" curtly.\n\nSympathy was plainly not welcome. In fact Binns was soon of the opinion\nthat here was an ugly customer, gentleman or no gentleman. A jolting\ncart was, however, not the best place for a man who seemed sore from\nhead to foot, and done for out and out. He sat and ground his teeth, as\nhe clung to the rough seat in the attempt to steady himself. He became\nmore and more \"gashly,\" and a certain awful light in his eyes alarmed\nthe carter by leaping up at every jolt. Binns was glad when he left him\nat Medham Arms, and felt he had earned the half-sovereign handed to him.\n\nFour days Anstruthers lay in bed in a room at the Inn. No one saw him\nbut the man who brought him food. He did not send for a doctor, because\nhe did not wish to see one. He sent for such remedies as were needed by\na man who had been bruised by a fall from his horse. He made no remark\nwhich could be considered explanatory, after he had said irritably that\na man was a fool to go loitering along on a nervous brute who needed\nwatching. Whatsoever happened was his own damned fault.\n\nThrough hours of day and night he lay staring at the whitewashed beams\nor the blue roses on the wall paper. They were long hours, and filled\nwith things not pleasant enough to dwell on in detail. Physical misery\nwhich made a man writhe at times was not the worst part of them. There\nwere a thousand things less endurable. More than once he foamed at the\nmouth, and recognised that he gibbered like a madman.\n\nThere was but one memory which saved him from feeling that this was the\nvery end of things. That was the memory of Broadmorlands. While a man\nhad a weapon left, even though it could not save him, he might pay up\nwith it--get almost even. The whole Vanderpoel lot could be plunged neck\ndeep in a morass which would leave mud enough sticking to them, even\nif their money helped them to prevent its entirely closing over their\nheads. He could attend to that, and, after he had set it well going, he\ncould get out. There were India, South Africa, Australia--a dozen places\nthat would do. And then he would remember Betty Vanderpoel, and curse\nhorribly under the bed clothes. It was the memory of Betty which outdid\nall others in its power to torment.\n\nOn the morning of the fifth day the Duke of Broadmorlands received a\nnote, which he read with somewhat annoyed curiosity. A certain Sir Nigel\nAnstruthers, whom it appeared he ought to be able to recall, was in the\nneighbourhood, and wished to see him on a parochial matter of interest.\n\"Parochial matter\" was vague, and so was the Duke's recollection of the\nman who addressed him. If his memory served him rightly, he had met\nhim in a country house in Somersetshire, and had heard that he was the\nacquaintance of the disreputable eldest son. What could a person of that\nsort have to say of parochial matters? The Duke considered, and then, in\nobedience to a rigorous conscience, decided that one ought, perhaps, to\ngive him half an hour.\n\nThere was that in the intruder's aspect, when he arrived in the\nafternoon, which produced somewhat the effect of shock. In the first\nplace, a man in his unconcealable physical condition had no right to be\nout of his bed. Though he plainly refused to admit the fact, his manner\nof bearing himself erect, and even with a certain touch of cool swagger,\nwas, it was evident, achieved only by determined effort. He looked like\na man who had not yet recovered from some evil fever. Since the meeting\nin Somersetshire he had aged more than the year warranted. Despite his\nobstinate fight with himself it was obvious that he was horribly shaky.\nA disagreeable scratch or cut, running from cheek to neck, did not\nimprove his personal appearance.\n\nHe pleased his host no more than he had pleased him at their first\nencounter; he, in fact, repelled him strongly, by suggesting a degree\nof abnormality of mood which was smoothed over by an attempt at entire\nnormality of manner. The Duke did not present an approachable front as,\nafter Anstruthers had taken a chair, he sat and examined him with bright\nblue old eyes set deep on either side of a dominant nose and framed over\nby white eyebrows. No, Nigel Anstruthers summed him up, it would not be\neasy to open the matter with the old fool. He held himself magnificently\naloof, with that lack of modernity in his sense of place which, even at\nthis late day, sometimes expressed itself here and there in the manner\nof the feudal survival.\n\n\"I am afraid you have been ill,\" with rigid civility.\n\n\"A man feels rather an outsider in confessing he has let his horse throw\nhim into a hedge. It was my own fault entirely. I allowed myself to\nforget that I was riding a dangerously nervous brute. I was thinking of\na painful and absorbing subject. I was badly bruised and scratched, but\nthat was all.\"\n\n\"What did your doctor say?\"\n\n\"That I was in luck not to have broken my neck.\"\n\n\"You had better have a glass of wine,\" touching a bell. \"You do not look\nequal to any exertion.\"\n\nIn gathering himself together, Sir Nigel felt he was forced to use\nenormous effort. It had cost him a gruesome physical struggle to endure\nthe drive over to Broadmorlands, though it was only a few miles from\nMedham. There had been something unnatural in the exertion necessary to\nsit upright and keep his mind decently clear. That was the worst of it.\nThe fever and raging hours of the past days and nights had so shaken him\nthat he had become exhausted, and his brain was not alert. He was not\nthinking rapidly, and several times he had lost sight of a point it was\nimportant to remember. He grew hot and cold and knew his hands and\nvoice shook, as he answered. But, perhaps--he felt desperately--signs of\nemotion were not bad.\n\n\"I am not quite equal to exertion,\" he began slowly. \"But a man cannot\nlie on his bed while some things are undone--a MAN cannot.\"\n\nAs the old Duke sat upright, the blue eyes under his bent brows were\nstartled, as well as curious. Was the man going out of his mind about\nsomething? He looked rather like it, with the dampness starting out on\nhis haggard face, and the ugly look suddenly stamped there. The fact was\nthat the insensate fury which had possessed and torn Anstruthers as he\nhad writhed in his inn bedroom had sprung upon him again in full force,\nand his weakness could not control it, though it would have been wiser\nto hold it in check. He also felt frightfully ill, which filled him\nwith despair, and, through this fact, he lost sight of the effect he\nproduced, as he stood up, shaking all over.\n\n\"I come to you because you are the one man who can most easily\nunderstand the thing I have been concealing for a good many years.\"\n\nThe Duke was irritated. Confound the objectionable idiot, what did he\nmean by taking that intimate tone with a man who was not prepared to\nconcern himself in his affairs?\n\n\"Excuse me,\" he said, holding up an authoritative hand, \"are you going\nto make a confession? I don't like such things. I prefer to be excused.\nPersonal confidences are not parochial matters.\"\n\n\"This one is.\" And Sir Nigel was sickeningly conscious that he was\nputting the statement rashly, while at the same time all better words\nescaped him. \"It is as much a parochial matter,\" losing all hold on his\nwits and stammering, \"as was--as was--the affair of--your wife.\"\n\nIt was the Duke who stood up now, scarlet with anger. He sprang from\nhis chair as if he had been a young man in whom some insult had struck\nblazing fire.\n\n\"You--you dare!\" he shouted. \"You insolent blackguard! You force your\nway in here and dare--dare----!\" And he clenched his fist, wildly\nshaking it.\n\nNigel Anstruthers, staggering on his uncertain feet, would have shouted\nalso, but could not, though he tried, and he heard his own voice come\nforth brokenly.\n\n\"Yes, I dare! I--your--my own--my----!\"\n\nSwaying and tottering, he swung round to the chair he had left, and fell\ninto it, even while the old Duke, who stood raging before him, started\nback in outraged amazement. What was the fellow doing? Was he making\nfaces at him? The drawn malignant mouth and muscles suggested it. Was\nhe a lunatic, indeed? But the sense of disgusted outrage changed all at\nonce to horror, as, with a countenance still more hideously livid and\ntwisted, his visitor slid helplessly from his seat and lay a huddling\nheap of clothes on the floor.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L\n\nTHE PRIMEVAL THING\n\nWhen Mr. Vanderpoel landed in England his wife was with him. This\nquiet-faced woman, who was known to be on her way to join her daughter\nin England, was much discussed, envied, and glanced at, when she\npromenaded the deck with her husband, or sat in her chair softly wrapped\nin wonderful furs. Gradually, during the past months, she had been told\ncertain modified truths connected with her elder daughter's marriage.\nThey had been painful truths, but had been so softened and expurgated\nof their worst features that it had been possible to bear them, when one\nrealised that they did not, at least, mean that Rosy had forgotten or\nceased to love her mother and father, or wish to visit her home. The\nsteady clearness of foresight and readiness of resource which were often\nspoken of as being specially characteristic of Reuben S. Vanderpoel,\nwere all required, and employed with great tenderness, in the management\nof this situation. As little as it was possible that his wife should\nknow, was the utmost she must hear and be hurt by. Unless ensuing events\ncompelled further revelations, the rest of it should be kept from her.\nAs further protection, her husband had frankly asked her to content\nherself with a degree of limited information.\n\n\"I have meant all our lives, Annie, to keep from you the unpleasant\nthings a woman need not be troubled with,\" he had said. \"I promised\nmyself I would when you were a girl. I knew you would face things, if\nI needed your help, but you were a gentle little soul, like Rosy, and I\nnever intended that you should bear what was useless. Anstruthers was\na blackguard, and girls of all nations have married blackguards before.\nWhen you have Rosy safe at home, and know nothing can hurt her again,\nyou both may feel you would like to talk it over. Till then we won't go\ninto detail. You trust me, I know, when I tell you that you shall hold\nRosy in your arms very soon. We may have something of a fight, but there\ncan only be one end to it in a country as decent as England. Anstruthers\nisn't exactly what I should call an Englishman. Men rather like him are\nto be found in two or three places.\" His good-looking, shrewd, elderly\nface lighted with a fine smile. \"My handsome Betty has saved us a good\ndeal by carrying out her fifteen-year-old plan of going to find her\nsister,\" he ended.\n\nBefore they landed they had decided that Mrs. Vanderpoel should be\ncomfortably established in a hotel in London, and that after this was\narranged, her husband should go to Stornham Court alone. If Sir Nigel\ncould be induced to listen to logic, Rosalie, her child, and Betty\nshould come at once to town.\n\n\"And, if he won't listen to logic,\" added Mr. Vanderpoel, with a dry\ncomposure, \"they shall come just the same, my dear.\" And his wife put\nher arms round his neck and kissed him because she knew what he said was\nquite true, and she admired him--as she had always done--greatly.\n\nBut when the pilot came on board and there began to stir in the ship the\nagreeable and exciting bustle of the delivery of letters and welcoming\ntelegrams, among Mr. Vanderpoel's many yellow envelopes he opened one\nthe contents of which caused him to stand still for some moments--so\nstill, indeed, that some of the bystanders began to touch each other's\nelbows and whisper. He certainly read the message two or three times\nbefore he folded it up, returned it to its receptacle, and walked\ngravely to his wife's sitting-room.\n\n\"Reuben!\" she exclaimed, after her first look at him, \"have you bad\nnews? Oh, I hope not!\"\n\nHe came and sat down quietly beside her, taking her hand.\n\n\"Don't be frightened, Annie, my dear,\" he said. \"I have just been\nreminded of a verse in the Bible--about vengeance not belonging to mere\nhuman beings. Nigel Anstruthers has had a stroke of paralysis, and it is\nnot his first. Apparently, even if he lies on his back for some months\nthinking of harm, he won't be able to do it. He is finished.\"\n\nWhen he was carried by the express train through the country, he saw\nall that Betty had seen, though the summer had passed, and there were\nneither green trees nor hedges. He knew all that the long letters had\nmeant of stirred emotion and affection, and he was strongly moved,\nthough his mind was full of many things. There were the farmhouses,\nthe square-towered churches, the red-pointed hop oasts, and the village\nchildren. How distinctly she had made him see them! His Betty--his\nsplendid Betty! His heart beat at the thought of seeing her high, young\nblack head, and holding her safe in his arms again. Safe! He resented\nhaving used the word, because there was a shock in seeming to admit the\npossibility that anything in the universe could do wrong to her. Yet one\nman had been villain enough to mean her harm, and to threaten her\nwith it. He slightly shuddered as he thought of how the man was\nfinished--done for.\n\nThe train began to puff more loudly, as it slackened its pace. It was\ndrawing near to a rustic little station, and, as it passed in, he saw a\ncarriage standing outside, waiting on the road, and a footman in a\nlong coat, glancing into each window as the train went by. Two or three\ncountry people were watching it intently. Miss Vanderpoel's father\nwas coming up from London on it. The stationmaster rushed to open the\ncarriage door, and the footman hastened forward, but a tall lovely thing\nin grey was opposite the step as Mr. Vanderpoel descended it to the\nplatform. She did not recognise the presence of any other human\nbeing than himself. For the moment she seemed to forget even the\nbroad-shouldered man who had plainly come with her. As Reuben S.\nVanderpoel folded her in his arms, she folded him and kissed him as he\nwas not sure she had ever kissed him before.\n\n\"My splendid Betty! My own fine girl!\" he said.\n\nAnd when she cried out \"Father! Father!\" she bent and kissed the breast\nof his coat.\n\nHe knew who the big young man was before she turned to present him.\n\n\"This is Lord Mount Dunstan, father,\" she said. \"Since Nigel was brought\nhome, he has been very good to us.\"\n\nReuben S. Vanderpoel looked well into the man's eyes, as he shook hands\nwith him warmly, and this was what he said to himself:\n\n\"Yes, she's safe. This is quite safe. It is to be trusted with the whole\nthing.\"\n\nNot many days after her husband's arrival at Stornham Court, Mrs.\nVanderpoel travelled down from London, and, during her journey, scarcely\nsaw the wintry hedges and bare trees, because, as she sat in her\ncushioned corner of the railway carriage, she was inwardly offering up\ngentle, pathetically ardent prayers of gratitude. She was the woman who\nprays, and the many sad petitions of the past years were being answered\nat last. She was being allowed to go to Rosy--whatsoever happened, she\ncould never be really parted from her girl again. She asked pardon many\ntimes because she had not been able to be really sorry when she had\nheard of her son-in-law's desperate condition. She could feel pity for\nhim in his awful case, she told herself, but she could not wish for the\nthing which perhaps she ought to wish for. She had confided this to her\nhusband with innocent, penitent tears, and he had stroked her cheek,\nwhich had always been his comforting way since they had been young\nthings together.\n\n\"My dear,\" he said, \"if a tiger with hydrophobia were loose among a lot\nof decent people--or indecent ones, for the matter of that--you would\nnot feel it your duty to be very sorry if, in springing on a group of\nthem, he impaled himself on an iron fence. Don't reproach yourself too\nmuch.\" And, though the realism of the picture he presented was such as\nto make her exclaim, \"No! No!\" there were still occasional moments when\nshe breathed a request for pardon if she was hard of heart--this softest\nof creatures human.\n\nIt was arranged by the two who best knew and loved her that her meeting\nwith Rosalie should have no spectators, and that their first hour\ntogether should be wholly unbroken in upon.\n\n\"You have not seen each other for so long,\" Betty said, when, on her\narrival, she led her at once to the morning-room where Rosy waited,\npale with joy, but when the door was opened, though the two figures were\nswept into each other's arms by one wild, tremulous rush of movement,\nthere were no sounds to be heard, only caught breaths, until the door\nhad closed again.\n\nThe talks which took place between Mr. Vanderpoel and Lord Mount\nDunstan were many and long, and were of absorbing interest to both. Each\npresented to the other a new world, and a type of which his previous\nknowledge had been but incomplete.\n\n\"I wonder,\" Mr. Vanderpoel said, in the course of one of them, \"if\nmy world appeals to you as yours appeals to me. Naturally, from your\nstandpoint, it scarcely seems probable. Perhaps the up-building of large\nfinancial schemes presupposes a certain degree of imagination. I\nam becoming a romantic New York man of business, and I revel in it.\nKedgers, for instance,\" with the smile which, somehow, suggested Betty,\n\"Kedgers and the Lilium Giganteum, Mrs. Welden and old Doby threaten to\ndevelop into quite necessary factors in the scheme of happiness. What\nBetty has felt is even more comprehensible than it seemed at first.\"\n\nThey walked and rode together about the countryside; when Mount Dunstan\nitself was swept clean of danger, and only a few convalescents lingered\nto be taken care of in the huge ballroom, they spent many days in going\nover the estate. The desolate beauty of it appealed to and touched Mr.\nVanderpoel, as it had appealed to and touched his daughter, and, also,\nwakened in him much new and curious delight. But Mount Dunstan, with a\ntouch of his old obstinacy, insisted that he should ignore the beauty,\nand look closely at less admirable things.\n\n\"You must see the worst of this,\" he said. \"You must understand that I\ncan put no good face upon things, that I offer nothing, because I have\nnothing to offer.\"\n\nIf he had not been swept through and through by a powerful and rapturous\npassion, he would have detested and abhorred these days of deliberate\nproud laying bare of the nakedness of the land. But in the hours he\nspent with Betty Vanderpoel the passion gave him knowledge of the\nthings which, being elemental, do not concern themselves with pride and\nobstinacy, and do not remember them. Too much had ended, and too much\nbegun, to leave space or thought for poor things. In their eyes, when\nthey were together, and even when they were apart, dwelt a glow which\nwas deeply moving to those who, looking on, were sufficiently profound\nof thought to understand.\n\nWatching the two walking slowly side by side down the leafless avenue on\na crystal winter day, Mr. Vanderpoel conversed with the vicar, whom he\ngreatly liked.\n\n\"A young man of the name of Selden,\" he remarked, \"told me more of this\nthan he knew.\"\n\n\"G. Selden,\" said the vicar, with affectionate smiling. \"He is not aware\nthat he was largely concerned in the matter. In fact, without G. Selden,\nI do not know how, exactly, we should have got on. How is he, nice\nfellow?\"\n\n\"Extremely well, and in these days in my employ. He is of the honest,\nindefatigable stuff which makes its way.\"\n\nHis own smiles, as he watched the two tall figures in the distance,\nsettled into an expression of speculative absorption, because he was\nreflecting upon profoundly interesting matters.\n\n\"There is a great primeval thing which sometimes--not often, only\nsometimes--occurs to two people,\" he went on. \"When it leaps into being,\nit is well if it is not thwarted, or done to death. It has happened to\nmy girl and Mount Dunstan. If they had been two young tinkers by the\nroadside, they would have come together, and defied their beggary. As\nit is, I recognise, as I sit here, that the outcome of what is to be may\nreach far, and open up broad new ways.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the vicar. \"She will live here and fill a strong man's life\nwith wonderful human happiness--her splendid children will be born here,\nand among them will be those who lead the van and make history.\"\n\n. . . . .\n\nFor some time Nigel Anstruthers lay in his room at Stornham Court,\nsurrounded by all of aid and luxury that wealth and exalted medical\nscience could gather about him. Sometimes he lay a livid unconscious\nmask, sometimes his nurses and doctors knew that in his hollow eyes\nthere was the light of a raging half reason, and they saw that he\nstruggled to utter coherent sounds which they might comprehend. This he\nnever accomplished, and one day, in the midst of such an effort, he was\nstricken dumb again, and soon afterwards sank into stillness and died.\n\nAnd the Shuttle in the hand of Fate, through every hour of every day,\nand through the slow, deep breathing of all the silent nights, weaves\nto and fro--to and fro--drawing with it the threads of human life and\nthought which strengthen its web: and trace the figures of its yet vague\nand uncompleted design.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Shuttle, by Frances Hodgson Burnett\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE SHUTTLE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 506.txt or 506.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/5\/0\/506\/\n\nProduced by Charles Keller and David Widger\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":248,"split":"train"}
