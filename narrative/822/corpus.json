When McCready attacks Thorpe's wife Isobel, Kazan kills McCready and then runs away fearing the harsh punishment for killing a man. He later encounters a wolf pack of which he becomes the new leader, and has a mate, Gray Wolf.\nOne day the pack comes across a sick, old man, Pierre Radisson, his married daughter Joan and her baby girl. Seeing the woman, Kazan turns against his pack, protecting the family from the other wolves. Eventually the pack, with the exception of Gray Wolf, runs away. Joan and her father take Kazan with them and nurse his wounds. After he has recovered, his new owners leave for Pierre's cabin in Churchill. Gray Wolf follows them at a distance hoping to be reunited with Kazan. Pierre dies on the journey, leaving his daughter, her child and Kazan alone to reach the cabin. That winter Kazan spends the day with Gray Wolf while sleeping at the cabin at night.\nThat spring Gray Wolf has had three cubs. Kazan begins staying longer with Gray Wolf, even hunting for her. One day, when he returns from one of his hunts, Kazan finds a lynx fighting with Gray Wolf. Kazan attacks the lynx and soon kills it but then discovers his cubs are dead and Gray Wolf is now blind.\nFew days later, Joan and her husband are ready to leave. They have decided to take Kazan with them and he is tied up so he can't escape. However, as the family is ready to go, they see Gray Wolf by the river howling to Kazan who immediately runs to her. The pair stay together, narrowly escaping a forest fire that ravages the wilderness. They are then captured by Henry Lottie, a trapper, and his companion, Paul Wayman, a former hunter, now an environmentalist and animal lover. Wayman buys the wolves from Lottie and sets them free.\nThe wolves return to their old lair where Gray Wolf gives birth to a male cub, Baree. The half wolf-half dog pup who leaves his parents after a few months, ready to survive on his own. A large colony of beavers shows up at the nearby river and begins building a dam despite the wolves' attempts to run them off. One day Kazan accidentally kills his only ally against the intruders, a large river otter, after mistaking her for one of the beavers. Eventually the entire area around the couple's territory is flooded and they are forced to leave. They head north together until are separated by Sandy McTrigger, a gold digger and possible murderer. He captures Kazan with the plan to use him in fights. However, when Kazan and his opponent, half great dane, half mastiff known as Dane, face each other, they silently agree not to fight, thus earning the respect of an old man, Professor McGill, who buys off the two dogs from their owners. McGill and the dogs prepare for their journey to Fond Du Lac and soon leave. Several days later, Mctrigger, who apparently had tracked them down, tries to sneak on them, but is heard and attacked by Kazan. Using the opportunity, Kazan runs away just as McGill shoots Sandy multiple times, thus killing him.\nThe story continues with Joan and her husband, who have returned to the wild with their daughter. Soon after they see Kazan again away in the distance, who joins them for a moment, only to leave when he hears Gray Wolf howling for him. The book ends with the reunited pair who once again hunts together side by side under the moon.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Kazan, by James Oliver Curwood\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

THE CALL OF SUN ROCK\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nTHE MIRACLE\n\n\nKazan lay mute and motionless, his gray nose between his forepaws, his\neyes half closed. A rock could have appeared scarcely less lifeless than\nhe; not a muscle twitched; not a hair moved; not an eyelid quivered. Yet\nevery drop of the wild blood in his splendid body was racing in a\nferment of excitement that Kazan had never before experienced; every\nnerve and fiber of his wonderful muscles was tense as steel wire.\nQuarter-strain wolf, three-quarters \"husky,\" he had lived the four years\nof his life in the wilderness. He had felt the pangs of starvation. He\nknew what it meant to freeze. He had listened to the wailing winds of\nthe long Arctic night over the barrens. He had heard the thunder of the\ntorrent and the cataract, and had cowered under the mighty crash of the\nstorm. His throat and sides were scarred by battle, and his eyes were\nred with the blister of the snows. He was called Kazan, the Wild Dog,\nbecause he was a giant among his kind and as fearless, even, as the men\nwho drove him through the perils of a frozen world.\n\nHe had never known fear--until now. He had never felt in him before the\ndesire to _run_--not even on that terrible day in the forest when he had\nfought and killed the big gray lynx. He did not know what it was that\nfrightened him, but he knew that he was in another world, and that many\nthings in it startled and alarmed him. It was his first glimpse of\ncivilization. He wished that his master would come back into the strange\nroom where he had left him. It was a room filled with hideous things.\nThere were great human faces on the wall, but they did not move or\nspeak, but stared at him in a way he had never seen people look before.\nHe remembered having looked on a master who lay very quiet and very cold\nin the snow, and he had sat back on his haunches and wailed forth the\ndeath song; but these people on the walls looked alive, and yet seemed\ndead.\n\nSuddenly Kazan lifted his ears a little. He heard steps, then low\nvoices. One of them was his master's voice. But the other--it sent a\nlittle tremor through him! Once, so long ago that it must have been in\nhis puppyhood days, he seemed to have had a dream of a laugh that was\nlike the girl's laugh--a laugh that was all at once filled with a\nwonderful happiness, the thrill of a wonderful love, and a sweetness\nthat made Kazan lift his head as they came in. He looked straight at\nthem, his red eyes gleaming. At once he knew that she must be dear to\nhis master, for his master's arm was about her. In the glow of the light\nhe saw that her hair was very bright, and that there was the color of\nthe crimson _bakneesh_ vine in her face and the blue of the _bakneesh_\nflower in her shining eyes. Suddenly she saw him, and with a little cry\ndarted toward him.\n\n\"Stop!\" shouted the man. \"He's dangerous! Kazan--\"\n\nShe was on her knees beside him, all fluffy and sweet and beautiful, her\neyes shining wonderfully, her hands about to touch him. Should he cringe\nback? Should he snap? Was she one of the things on the wall, and his\nenemy? Should he leap at her white throat? He saw the man running\nforward, pale as death. Then her hand fell upon his head and the touch\nsent a thrill through him that quivered in every nerve of his body. With\nboth hands she turned up his head. Her face was very close, and he heard\nher say, almost sobbingly:\n\n\"And you are Kazan--dear old Kazan, my Kazan, my hero dog--who brought\nhim home to me when all the others had died! My Kazan--my hero!\"\n\nAnd then, miracle of miracles, her face was crushed down against him,\nand he felt her sweet warm touch.\n\nIn those moments Kazan did not move. He scarcely breathed. It seemed a\nlong time before the girl lifted her face from him. And when she did,\nthere were tears in her blue eyes, and the man was standing above them,\nhis hands gripped tight, his jaws set.\n\n\"I never knew him to let any one touch him--with their naked hand,\" he\nsaid in a tense wondering voice. \"Move back quietly, Isobel. Good\nheaven--look at that!\"\n\nKazan whined softly, his bloodshot eyes on the girl's face. He wanted to\nfeel her hand again; he wanted to touch her face. Would they beat him\nwith a club, he wondered, if he _dared_! He meant no harm now. He would\nkill for her. He cringed toward her, inch by inch, his eyes never\nfaltering. He heard what the man said--\"Good heaven! Look at that!\"--and\nhe shuddered. But no blow fell to drive him back. His cold muzzle\ntouched her filmy dress, and she looked at him, without moving, her wet\neyes blazing like stars.\n\n\"See!\" she whispered. \"See!\"\n\nHalf an inch more--an inch, two inches, and he gave his big gray body a\nhunch toward her. Now his muzzle traveled slowly upward--over her foot,\nto her lap, and at last touched the warm little hand that lay there. His\neyes were still on her face: he saw a queer throbbing in her bare white\nthroat, and then a trembling of her lips as she looked up at the man\nwith a wonderful look. He, too, knelt down beside them, and put his arm\nabout the girl again, and patted the dog on his head. Kazan did not like\nthe man's touch. He mistrusted it, as nature had taught him to mistrust\nthe touch of all men's hands, but he permitted it because he saw that it\nin some way pleased the girl.\n\n\"Kazan, old boy, you wouldn't hurt her, would you?\" said his master\nsoftly. \"We both love her, don't we, boy? Can't help it, can we? And\nshe's ours, Kazan, all _ours_! She belongs to you and to me, and we're\ngoing to take care of her all our lives, and if we ever have to we'll\nfight for her like hell--won't we? Eh, Kazan, old boy?\"\n\nFor a long time after they left him where he was lying on the rug,\nKazan's eyes did not leave the girl. He watched and listened--and all\nthe time there grew more and more in him the craving to creep up to them\nand touch the girl's hand, or her dress, or her foot. After a time his\nmaster said something, and with a little laugh the girl jumped up and\nran to a big, square, shining thing that stood crosswise in a corner,\nand which had a row of white teeth longer than his own body. He had\nwondered what those teeth were for. The girl's fingers touched them now,\nand all the whispering of winds that he had ever heard, all the music of\nthe waterfalls and the rapids and the trilling of birds in spring-time,\ncould not equal the sounds they made. It was his first music. For a\nmoment it startled and frightened him, and then he felt the fright pass\naway and a strange tingling in his body. He wanted to sit back on his\nhaunches and howl, as he had howled at the billion stars in the skies on\ncold winter nights. But something kept him from doing that. It was the\ngirl. Slowly he began slinking toward her. He felt the eyes of the man\nupon him, and stopped. Then a little more--inches at a time, with his\nthroat and jaw straight out along the floor! He was half-way to\nher--half-way across the room--when the wonderful sounds grew very soft\nand very low.\n\n\"Go on!\" he heard the man urge in a low quick voice. \"Go on! Don't\nstop!\"\n\nThe girl turned her head, saw Kazan cringing there on the floor, and\ncontinued to play. The man was still looking, but his eyes could not\nkeep Kazan back now. He went nearer, still nearer, until at last his\noutreaching muzzle touched her dress where it lay piled on the floor.\nAnd then--he lay trembling, for she had begun to sing. He had heard a\nCree woman crooning in front of her tepee; he had heard the wild chant\nof the caribou song--but he had never heard anything like this\nwonderful sweetness that fell from the lips of the girl. He forgot his\nmaster's presence now. Quietly, cringingly, so that she would not know,\nhe lifted his head. He saw her looking at him; there was something in\nher wonderful eyes that gave him confidence, and he laid his head in her\nlap. For the second time he felt the touch of a woman's hand, and he\nclosed his eyes with a long sighing breath. The music stopped. There\ncame a little fluttering sound above him, like a laugh and a sob in one.\nHe heard his master cough.\n\n\"I've always loved the old rascal--but I never thought he'd do that,\" he\nsaid; and his voice sounded queer to Kazan.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nINTO THE NORTH\n\n\nWonderful days followed for Kazan. He missed the forests and deep snows.\nHe missed the daily strife of keeping his team-mates in trace, the\nyapping at his heels, the straight long pull over the open spaces and\nthe barrens. He missed the \"Koosh--koosh--Hoo-yah!\" of the driver, the\nspiteful snap of his twenty-foot caribou-gut whip, and that yelping and\nstraining behind him that told him he had his followers in line. But\nsomething had come to take the place of that which he missed. It was in\nthe room, in the air all about him, even when the girl or his master was\nnot near. Wherever she had been, he found the presence of that strange\nthing that took away his loneliness. It was the woman scent, and\nsometimes it made him whine softly when the girl herself was actually\nwith him. He was not lonely, nights, when he should have been out\nhowling at the stars. He was not lonely, because one night he prowled\nabout until he found a certain door, and when the girl opened that door\nin the morning she found him curled up tight against it. She had reached\ndown and hugged him, the thick smother of her long hair falling all over\nhim in a delightful perfume; thereafter she placed a rug before the door\nfor him to sleep on. All through the long nights he knew that she was\njust beyond the door, and he was content. Each day he thought less and\nless of the wild places, and more of her.\n\nThen there came the beginning of the change. There was a strange hurry\nand excitement around him, and the girl paid less attention to him. He\ngrew uneasy. He sniffed the change in the air, and he began to study his\nmaster's face. Then there came the morning, very early, when the babiche\ncollar and the iron chain were fastened to him again. Not until he had\nfollowed his master out through the door and into the street did he\nbegin to understand. They were sending him away! He sat suddenly back on\nhis haunches and refused to budge.\n\n\"Come, Kazan,\" coaxed the man. \"Come on, boy.\"\n\nHe hung back and showed his white fangs. He expected the lash of a whip\nor the blow of a club, but neither came. His master laughed and took him\nback to the house. When they left it again, the girl was with them and\nwalked with her hand touching his head. It was she who persuaded him to\nleap up through a big dark hole into the still darker interior of a car,\nand it was she who lured him to the darkest corner of all, where his\nmaster fastened his chain. Then they went out, laughing like two\nchildren. For hours after that, Kazan lay still and tense, listening to\nthe queer rumble of wheels under him. Several times those wheels\nstopped, and he heard voices outside. At last he was sure that he heard\na familiar voice, and he strained at his chain and whined. The closed\ndoor slid back. A man with a lantern climbed in, followed by his master.\nHe paid no attention to them, but glared out through the opening into\nthe gloom of night. He almost broke loose when he leaped down upon the\nwhite snow, but when he saw no one there, he stood rigid, sniffing the\nair. Over him were the stars he had howled at all his life, and about\nhim were the forests, black and silent, shutting them in like a wall.\nVainly he sought for that one scent that was missing, and Thorpe heard\nthe low note of grief in his shaggy throat. He took the lantern and held\nit above his head, at the same time loosening his hold on the leash. At\nthat signal there came a voice from out of the night. It came from\nbehind them, and Kazan whirled so suddenly that the loosely held chain\nslipped from the man's hand. He saw the glow of other lanterns. And\nthen, once more, the voice--\n\n\"Kaa-aa-zan!\"\n\nHe was off like a bolt. Thorpe laughed to himself as he followed.\n\n\"The old pirate!\" he chuckled.\n\nWhen he came to the lantern-lighted space back of the caboose, Thorpe\nfound Kazan crouching down at a woman's feet. It was Thorpe's wife. She\nsmiled triumphantly at him as he came up out of the gloom.\n\n\"You've won!\" he laughed, not unhappily. \"I'd have wagered my last\ndollar he wouldn't do that for any voice on earth. You've won! Kazan,\nyou brute, I've lost you!\"\n\nHis face suddenly sobered as Isobel stooped to pick up the end of the\nchain.\n\n\"He's yours, Issy,\" he added quickly, \"but you must let me care for him\nuntil--we _know_. Give me the chain. I won't trust him even now. He's a\nwolf. I've seen him take an Indian's hand off at a single snap. I've\nseen him tear out another dog's jugular in one leap. He's an outlaw--a\nbad dog--in spite of the fact that he hung to me like a hero and brought\nme out alive. I can't trust him. Give me the chain--\"\n\nHe did not finish. With the snarl of a wild beast Kazan had leaped to\nhis feet. His lips drew up and bared his long fangs. His spine\nstiffened, and with a sudden cry of warning, Thorpe dropped a hand to\nthe revolver at his belt.\n\nKazan paid no attention to him. Another form had approached out of the\nnight, and stood now in the circle of illumination made by the lanterns.\nIt was McCready, who was to accompany Thorpe and his young wife back to\nthe Red River camp, where Thorpe was in charge of the building of the\nnew Trans-continental. The man was straight, powerfully built and clean\nshaven. His jaw was so square that it was brutal, and there was a glow\nin his eyes that was almost like the passion in Kazan's as he looked at\nIsobel.\n\nHer red and white stocking-cap had slipped free of her head and was\nhanging over her shoulder. The dull blaze of the lanterns shone in the\nwarm glow of her hair. Her cheeks were flushed, and her eyes, suddenly\nturned to him, were as blue as the bluest _bakneesh_ flower and glowed\nlike diamonds. McCready shifted his gaze, and instantly her hand fell on\nKazan's head. For the first time the dog did not seem to feel her touch.\nHe still snarled at McCready, the rumbling menace in his throat growing\ndeeper. Thorpe's wife tugged at the chain.\n\n\"Down, Kazan--down!\" she commanded.\n\nAt the sound of her voice he relaxed.\n\n\"Down!\" she repeated, and her free hand fell on his head again. He slunk\nto her feet. But his lips were still drawn back. Thorpe was watching\nhim. He wondered at the deadly venom that shot from the wolfish eyes,\nand looked at McCready. The big guide had uncoiled his long dog-whip. A\nstrange look had come into his face. He was staring hard at Kazan.\nSuddenly he leaned forward, with both hands on his knees, and for a\ntense moment or two he seemed to forget that Isobel Thorpe's wonderful\nblue eyes were looking at him.\n\n\"Hoo-koosh, Pedro--_charge_!\"\n\nThat one word--_charge_--was taught only to the dogs in the service of\nthe Northwest Mounted Police. Kazan did not move. McCready straightened,\nand quick as a shot sent the long lash of his whip curling out into the\nnight with a crack like a pistol report.\n\n\"Charge, Pedro--_charge_!\"\n\nThe rumble in Kazan's throat deepened to a snarling growl, but not a\nmuscle of his body moved. McCready turned to Thorpe.\n\n\"I could have sworn that I knew that dog,\" he said. \"If it's Pedro, he's\n_bad_!\"\n\nThorpe was taking the chain. Only the girl saw the look that came for an\ninstant into McCready's face. It made her shiver. A few minutes before,\nwhen the train had first stopped at Les Pas, she had offered her hand\nto this man and she had seen the same thing then. But even as she\nshuddered she recalled the many things her husband had told her of the\nforest people. She had grown to love them, to admire their big rough\nmanhood and loyal hearts, before he had brought her among them; and\nsuddenly she smiled at McCready, struggling to overcome that thrill of\nfear and dislike.\n\n\"He doesn't like you,\" she laughed at him softly. \"Won't you make\nfriends with him?\"\n\nShe drew Kazan toward him, with Thorpe holding the end of the chain.\nMcCready came to her side as she bent over the dog. His back was to\nThorpe as he hunched down. Isobel's bowed head was within a foot of his\nface. He could see the glow in her cheek and the pouting curve of her\nmouth as she quieted the low rumbling in Kazan's throat. Thorpe stood\nready to pull back on the chain, but for a moment McCready was between\nhim and his wife, and he could not see McCready's face. The man's eyes\nwere not on Kazan. He was staring at the girl.\n\n\"You're brave,\" he said. \"I don't dare do that. He would take off my\nhand!\"\n\nHe took the lantern from Thorpe and led the way to a narrow snow-path\nbranching off, from the track. Hidden back in the thick spruce was the\ncamp that Thorpe had left a fortnight before. There were two tents there\nnow in place of the one that he and his guide had used. A big fire was\nburning in front of them. Close to the fire was a long sledge, and\nfastened to trees just within the outer circle of firelight Kazan saw\nthe shadowy forms and gleaming eyes of his team-mates. He stood stiff\nand motionless while Thorpe fastened him to a sledge. Once more he was\nback in his forests--and in command. His mistress was laughing and\nclapping her hands delightedly in the excitement of the strange and\nwonderful life of which she had now become a part. Thorpe had thrown\nback the flap of their tent, and she was entering ahead of him. She did\nnot look back. She spoke no word to him. He whined, and turned his red\neyes on McCready.\n\nIn the tent Thorpe was saying:\n\n\"I'm sorry old Jackpine wouldn't go back with us, Issy. He drove me\ndown, but for love or money I couldn't get him to return. He's a Mission\nIndian, and I'd give a month's salary to have you see him handle the\ndogs. I'm not sure about this man McCready. He's a queer chap, the\nCompany's agent here tells me, and knows the woods like a book. But dogs\ndon't like a stranger. Kazan isn't going to take to him worth a cent!\"\n\nKazan heard the girl's voice, and stood rigid and motionless listening\nto it. He did not hear or see McCready when he came up stealthily behind\nhim. The man's voice came as suddenly as a shot at his heels.\n\n\"_Pedro_!\"\n\nIn an instant Kazan cringed as if touched by a lash.\n\n\"Got you that time--didn't I, you old devil!\" whispered McCready, his\nface strangely pale in the firelight. \"Changed your name, eh? But I\n_got_ you--didn't I?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nMcCREADY PAYS THE DEBT\n\n\nFor a long time after he had uttered those words McCready sat in silence\nbeside the fire. Only for a moment or two at a time did his eyes leave\nKazan. After a little, when he was sure that Thorpe and Isobel had\nretired for the night, he went into his own tent and returned with a\nflask of whisky. During the next half-hour he drank frequently. Then he\nwent over and sat on the end of the sledge, just beyond the reach of\nKazan's chain.\n\n\"Got you, didn't I?\" he repeated, the effect of the liquor beginning to\nshow in the glitter of his eyes. \"Wonder who changed your name, Pedro.\nAnd how the devil did _he_ come by you? Ho, ho, if you could only\ntalk--\"\n\nThey heard Thorpe's voice inside the tent. It was followed by a low\ngirlish peal of laughter, and McCready jerked himself erect. His face\nblazed suddenly red, and he rose to his feet, dropping the flask in his\ncoat pocket. Walking around the fire, he tiptoed cautiously to the\nshadow of a tree close to the tent and stood there for many minutes\nlistening. His eyes burned with a fiery madness when he returned to the\nsledge and Kazan. It was midnight before he went into his own tent.\n\nIn the warmth of the fire, Kazan's eyes slowly closed. He slumbered\nuneasily, and his brain was filled with troubled pictures. At times he\nwas fighting, and his jaws snapped. At others he was straining at the\nend of his chain, with McCready or his mistress just out of reach. He\nfelt the gentle touch of the girl's hand again and heard the wonderful\nsweetness of her voice as she sang to him and his master, and his body\ntrembled and twitched with the thrills that had filled him that night.\nAnd then the picture changed. He was running at the head of a splendid\nteam--six dogs of the Royal Northwest Mounted Police--and his master was\ncalling him Pedro! The scene shifted. They were in camp. His master was\nyoung and smooth-faced and he helped from the sledge another man whose\nhands were fastened in front of him by curious black rings. Again it was\nlater--and he was lying before a great fire. His master was sitting\nopposite him, with his back to a tent, and as he looked, there came out\nof the tent the man with the black rings--only now the rings were gone\nand his hands were free, and in one of them he carried a heavy club. He\nheard the terrible blow of the club as it fell on his master's head--and\nthe sound of it aroused him from his restless sleep.\n\nHe sprang to his feet, his spine stiffening and a snarl in his throat.\nThe fire had died down and the camp was in the darker gloom that\nprecedes dawn. Through that gloom Kazan saw McCready. Again he was\nstanding close to the tent of his mistress, and he knew now that this\nwas the man who had worn the black iron rings, and that it was he who\nhad beaten him with whip and club for many long days after he had killed\nhis master. McCready heard the menace in his throat and came back\nquickly to the fire. He began to whistle and draw the half-burned logs\ntogether, and as the fire blazed up afresh he shouted to awaken Thorp\nand Isobel. In a few minutes Thorpe appeared at the tent-flap and his\nwife followed him out. Her loose hair rippled in billows of gold about\nher shoulders and she sat down on the sledge, close to Kazan, and began\nbrushing it. McCready came up behind her and fumbled among the packages\non the sledge. As if by accident one of his hands buried itself for an\ninstant in the rich tresses that flowed down her back. She did not at\nfirst feel the caressing touch of his fingers, and Thorpe's back was\ntoward them.\n\nOnly Kazan saw the stealthy movement of the hand, the fondling clutch of\nthe fingers in her hair, and the mad passion burning in the eyes of the\nman. Quicker than a lynx, the dog had leaped the length of his chain\nacross the sledge. McCready sprang back just in time, and as Kazan\nreached the end of his chain he was jerked back so that his body struck\nsidewise against the girl. Thorpe had turned in time to see the end of\nthe leap. He believed that Kazan had sprung at Isobel, and in his horror\nno word or cry escaped his lips as he dragged her from where she had\nhalf fallen over the sledge. He saw that she was not hurt, and he\nreached for his revolver. It was in his holster in the tent. At his feet\nwas McCready's whip, and in the passion of the moment he seized it and\nsprang upon Kazan. The dog crouched in the snow. He made no move to\nescape or to attack. Only once in his life could he remember having\nreceived a beating like that which Thorpe inflicted upon him now. But\nnot a whimper or a growl escaped him.\n\n[Illustration: \"Not another blow!\"]\n\nAnd then, suddenly, his mistress ran forward and caught the whip poised\nabove Thorpe's head.\n\n\"Not another blow!\" she cried, and something in her voice held him from\nstriking. McCready did not hear what she said then, but a strange look\ncame into Thorpe's eyes, and without a word he followed his wife into\ntheir tent.\n\n\"Kazan did not leap at me,\" she whispered, and she was trembling with a\nsudden excitement. Her face was deathly white. \"That man was behind me,\"\nshe went on, clutching her husband by the arm. \"I felt him touch me--and\nthen Kazan sprang. He wouldn't bite _me_. It's the _man_! There's\nsomething--wrong--\"\n\nShe was almost sobbing, and Thorpe drew her close in his arms.\n\n\"I hadn't thought before--but it's strange,\" he said. \"Didn't McCready\nsay something about knowing the dog? It's possible. Perhaps he's had\nKazan before and abused him in a way that the dog has not forgotten.\nTo-morrow I'll find out. But until I know--will you promise to keep away\nfrom Kazan?\"\n\nIsobel gave the promise. When they came out from the tent Kazan lifted\nhis great head. The stinging lash had closed one of his eyes and his\nmouth was dripping blood. Isobel gave a low sob, but did not go near\nhim. Half blinded, he knew that his mistress had stopped his punishment,\nand he whined softly, and wagged his thick tail in the snow.\n\nNever had he felt so miserable as through the long hard hours of the day\nthat followed, when he broke the trail for his team-mates into the\nNorth. One of his eyes was closed and filled with stinging fire, and his\nbody was sore from the blows of the caribou lash. But it was not\nphysical pain that gave the sullen droop to his head and robbed his body\nof that keen quick alertness of the lead-dog--the commander of his\nmates. It was his spirit. For the first time in his life, it was broken.\nMcCready had beaten him--long ago; his master had beaten him; and\nduring all this day their voices were fierce and vengeful in his ears.\nBut it was his mistress who hurt him most. She held aloof from him,\nalways beyond they reach of his leash; and when they stopped to rest,\nand again in camp, she looked at him with strange and wondering eyes,\nand did not speak. She, too, was ready to beat him. He believed that,\nand so slunk away from her and crouched on his belly in the snow. With\nhim, a broken spirit meant a broken heart, and that night he lurked in\none of the deepest shadows about the camp-fire and grieved alone. None\nknew that it was grief--unless it was the girl. She did not move toward\nhim. She did not speak to him. But she watched him closely--and studied\nhim hardest when he was looking at McCready.\n\nLater, after Thorpe and his wife had gone into their tent, it began to\nsnow, and the effect of the snow upon McCready puzzled Kazan. The man\nwas restless, and he drank frequently from the flask that he had used\nthe night before. In the firelight his face grew redder and redder, and\nKazan could see the strange gleam of his teeth as he gazed at the tent\nin which his mistress was sleeping. Again and again he went close to\nthat tent, and listened. Twice he heard movement. The last time, it was\nthe sound of Thorpe's deep breathing. McCready hurried back to the fire\nand turned his face straight up to the sky. The snow was falling so\nthickly that when he lowered his face he blinked and wiped his eyes.\nThen he went out into the gloom and bent low over the trail they had\nmade a few hours before. It was almost obliterated by the falling snow.\nAnother hour and there would be no trail--nothing the next day to tell\nwhoever might pass that they had come this way. By morning it would\ncover everything, even the fire, if he allowed it to die down. McCready\ndrank again, out in the darkness. Low words of an insane joy burst from\nhis lips. His head was hot with a drunken fire. His heart beat madly,\nbut scarcely more furiously than did Kazan's when the dog saw that\nMcCready was returning _with a club_! The club he placed on end against\na tree. Then he took a lantern from the sledge and lighted it. He\napproached Thorpe's tent-flap, the lantern in his hand.\n\n\"Ho, Thorpe--Thorpe!\" he called.\n\nThere was no answer. He could hear Thorpe breathing. He drew the flap\naside a little, and raised his voice.\n\n\"Thorpe!\"\n\nStill there was no movement inside, and he untied the flap strings and\nthrust in his lantern. The light flashed on Isobel's golden head, and\nMcCready stared at it, his eyes burning like red coals, until he saw\nthat Thorpe was awakening. Quickly he dropped the flap and rustled it\nfrom the outside.\n\n\"Ho, Thorpe!--Thorpe!\" he called again.\n\nThis time Thorpe replied.\n\n\"Hello, McCready--is that you?\"\n\nMcCready drew the flap back a little, and spoke in a low voice.\n\n\"Yes. Can you come out a minute? Something's happening out in the woods.\nDon't wake up your wife!\"\n\nHe drew back and waited. A minute later Thorpe came quietly out of the\ntent. McCready pointed into the thick spruce.\n\n\"I'll swear there's some one nosing around the camp,\" he said. \"I'm\ncertain that I saw a man out there a few minutes ago, when I went for a\nlog. It's a good night for stealing dogs. Here--you take the lantern! If\nI wasn't clean fooled, we'll find a trail in the snow.\"\n\nHe gave Thorpe the lantern and picked up the heavy club. A growl rose in\nKazan's throat, but he choked it back. He wanted to snarl forth his\nwarning, to leap at the end of his leash, but he knew that if he did\nthat, they would return and beat him. So he lay still, trembling and\nshivering, and whining softly. He watched them until they\ndisappeared--and then waited--listened. At last he heard the crunch of\nsnow. He was not surprised to see McCready come back alone. He had\nexpected him to return alone. For he knew what a club meant!\n\nMcCready's face was terrible now. It was like a beast's. He was hatless.\nKazan slunk deeper in his shadow at the low horrible laugh that fell\nfrom his lips--for the man still held the club. In a moment he dropped\nthat, and approached the tent. He drew back the flap and peered in.\nThorpe's wife was sleeping, and as quietly as a cat he entered and hung\nthe lantern on a nail in the tent-pole. His movement did not awaken her,\nand for a few moments he stood there, staring--staring.\n\nOutside, crouching in the deep shadow, Kazan tried to fathom the meaning\nof these strange things that were happening. Why had his master and\nMcCready gone out into the forest? Why had not his master returned? It\nwas his master, and not McCready, who belonged in that tent. Then why\nwas McCready there? He watched McCready as he entered, and suddenly the\ndog was on his feet, his back tense and bristling, his limbs rigid. He\nsaw McCready's huge shadow on the canvas, and a moment later there came\na strange piercing cry. In the wild terror of that cry he recognized\n_her_ voice--and he leaped toward the tent. The leash stopped him,\nchoking the snarl in his throat. He saw the shadows struggling now, and\nthere came cry after cry. She was calling to his master, and with his\nmaster's name she was calling _him_!\n\n\"_Kazan_--_Kazan_--\"\n\nHe leaped again, and was thrown upon his back. A second and a third\ntime he sprang the length of the leash into the night, and the babiche\ncord about his neck cut into his flesh like a knife. He stopped for an\ninstant, gasping for breath. The shadows were still fighting. Now they\nwere upright! Now they were crumpling down! With a fierce snarl he flung\nhis whole weight once more at the end of the chain. There was a snap, as\nthe thong about his neck gave way.\n\nIn half a dozen bounds Kazan made the tent and rushed under the flap.\nWith a snarl he was at McCready's throat. The first snap of his powerful\njaws was death, but he did not know that. He knew only that his mistress\nwas there, and that he was fighting for her. There came one choking\ngasping cry that ended with a terrible sob; it was McCready. The man\nsank from his knees upon his back, and Kazan thrust his fangs deeper\ninto his enemy's throat; he felt the warm blood.\n\nThe dog's mistress was calling to him now. She was pulling at his shaggy\nneck. But he would not loose his hold--not for a long time. When he did,\nhis mistress looked down once upon the man and covered her face with\nher hands. Then she sank down upon the blankets. She was very still. Her\nface and hands were cold, and Kazan muzzled them tenderly. Her eyes were\nclosed. He snuggled up close against her, with his ready jaws turned\ntoward the dead man. Why was she so still, he wondered?\n\nA long time passed, and then she moved. Her eyes opened. Her hand\ntouched him.\n\nThen he heard a step outside.\n\nIt was his master, and with that old thrill of fear--fear of the\nclub--he went swiftly to the door. Yes, there was his master in the\nfirelight--and in his hand he held the club. He was coming slowly,\nalmost falling at each step, and his face was red with blood. But he had\n_the club_! He would beat him again--beat him terribly for hurting\nMcCready; so Kazan slipped quietly under the tent-flap and stole off\ninto the shadows. From out the gloom of the thick spruce he looked back,\nand a low whine of love and grief rose and died softly in his throat.\nThey would beat him always now--after _that_. Even _she_ would beat him.\nThey would hunt him down, and beat him when they found him.\n\nFrom out of the glow of the fire he turned his wolfish head to the\ndepths of the forest. There were no clubs or stinging lashes out in that\ngloom. They would never find him there.\n\nFor another moment he wavered. And then, as silently as one of the wild\ncreatures whose blood was partly his, he stole away into the blackness\nof the night.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nFREE FROM BONDS\n\n\nThere was a low moaning of the wind in the spruce-tops as Kazan slunk\noff into the blackness and mystery of the forest. For hours he lay near\nthe camp, his red and blistered eyes gazing steadily at the tent wherein\nthe terrible thing had happened a little while before.\n\nHe knew now what death was. He could tell it farther than man. He could\nsmell it in the air. And he knew that there was death all about him, and\nthat he was the cause of it. He lay on his belly in the deep snow and\nshivered, and the three-quarters of him that was dog whined in a\ngrief-stricken way, while the quarter that was wolf still revealed\nitself menacingly in his fangs, and in the vengeful glare of his eyes.\n\nThree times the man--his master--came out of the tent, and shouted\nloudly, \"Kazan--Kazan--Kazan!\"\n\nThree times the woman came with him. In the firelight Kazan could see\nher shining hair streaming about her, as he had seen it in the tent,\nwhen he had leaped up and killed the other man. In her blue eyes there\nwas the same wild terror, and her face was white as the snow. And the\nsecond and third time, she too called, \"Kazan--Kazan--Kazan!\"--and all\nthat part of him that was dog, and not wolf, trembled joyously at the\nsound of her voice, and he almost crept in to take his beating. But fear\nof the club was the greater, and he held back, hour after hour, until\nnow it was silent again in the tent, and he could no longer see their\nshadows, and the fire was dying down.\n\nCautiously he crept out from the thick gloom, working his way on his\nbelly toward the packed sledge, and what remained of the burned logs.\nBeyond that sledge, hidden in the darkness of the trees, was the body of\nthe man he had killed, covered with a blanket. Thorpe, his master, had\ndragged it there.\n\nHe lay down, with his nose to the warm coals and his eyes leveled\nbetween his forepaws, straight at the closed tent-flap. He meant to\nkeep awake, to watch, to be ready to slink off into the forest at the\nfirst movement there. But a warmth was rising from out of the gray ash\nof the fire-bed, and his eyes closed. Twice--three times--he fought\nhimself back into watchfulness; but the last time his eyes came only\nhalf open, and closed heavily again.\n\nAnd now, in his sleep, he whined softly, and the splendid muscles of his\nlegs and shoulders twitched, and sudden shuddering ripples ran along his\ntawny spine. Thorpe, who was in the tent, if he had seen him, would have\nknown that he was dreaming. And Thorpe's wife, whose golden head lay\nclose against his breast, and who shuddered and trembled now and then\neven as Kazan was doing, would have known what he was dreaming about.\n\nIn his sleep he was leaping again at the end of his chain. His jaws\nsnapped like castanets of steel,--and the sound awakened him, and he\nsprang to his feet, his spine as stiff as a brush, and his snarling\nfangs bared like ivory knives. He had awakened just in time. There was\nmovement in the tent. His master was awake, and if he did not escape--\n\nHe sped swiftly into the thick spruce, and paused, flat and hidden, with\nonly his head showing from behind a tree. He knew that his master would\nnot spare him. Three times Thorpe had beaten him for snapping at\nMcCready. The last time he would have shot him if the girl had not saved\nhim. And now he had torn McCready's throat. He had taken the life from\nhim, and his master would not spare him. Even the woman could not save\nhim.\n\nKazan was sorry that his master had returned, dazed and bleeding, after\nhe had torn McCready's jugular. Then he would have had her always. She\nwould have loved him. She did love him. And he would have followed her,\nand fought for her always, and died for her when the time came. But\nThorpe had come in from the forest again, and Kazan had slunk away\nquickly--for Thorpe meant to him what all men meant to him now: the\nclub, the whip and the strange things that spat fire and death. And\nnow--\n\nThorpe had come out from the tent. It was approaching dawn, and in his\nhand he held a rifle. A moment later the girl came out, and her hand\ncaught the man's arm. They looked toward the thing covered by the\nblanket. Then she spoke to Thorpe and he suddenly straightened and\nthrew back his head.\n\n\"H-o-o-o-o--Kazan--Kazan--Kazan!\" he called.\n\nA shiver ran through Kazan. The man was trying to inveigle him back. He\nhad in his hand the thing that killed.\n\n\"Kazan--Kazan--Ka-a-a-a-zan!\" he shouted again.\n\nKazan sneaked cautiously back from the tree. He knew that distance meant\nnothing to the cold thing of death that Thorpe held in his hand. He\nturned his head once, and whined softly, and for an instant a great\nlonging filled his reddened eyes as he saw the last of the girl.\n\nHe knew, now, that he was leaving her forever, and there was an ache in\nhis heart that had never been there before, a pain that was not of the\nclub or whip, of cold or hunger, but which was greater than them all,\nand which filled him with a desire to throw back his head and cry out\nhis loneliness to the gray emptiness of the sky.\n\nBack in the camp the girl's voice quivered.\n\n\"He is gone.\"\n\nThe man's strong voice choked a little.\n\n\"Yes, he is gone. _He knew_--and I didn't. I'd give--a year of my\nlife--if I hadn't whipped him yesterday and last night. He won't come\nback.\"\n\nIsobel Thorpe's hand tightened on his arm.\n\n\"He will!\" she cried. \"He won't leave me. He loved me, if he was savage\nand terrible. And he knows that I love him. He'll come back--\"\n\n\"Listen!\"\n\nFrom deep in the forest there came a long wailing howl, filled with a\nplaintive sadness. It was Kazan's farewell to the woman.\n\nAfter that cry Kazan sat for a long time on his haunches, sniffing the\nnew freedom of the air, and watching the deep black pits in the forest\nabout him, as they faded away before dawn. 'Now and then, since the day\nthe traders had first bought him and put him into sledge-traces away\nover on the Mackenzie, he had often thought of this freedom longingly,\nthe wolf blood in him urging him to take it. But he had never quite\ndared. It thrilled him now. There were no clubs here, no whips, none of\nthe man-beasts whom he had first learned to distrust, and then to hate.\nIt was his misfortune--that quarter-strain of wolf; and the clubs,\ninstead of subduing him, had added to the savagery that was born in him.\nMen had been his worst enemies. They had beaten him time and again until\nhe was almost dead. They called him \"bad,\" and stepped wide of him, and\nnever missed the chance to snap a whip over his back. His body was\ncovered with scars they had given him.\n\nHe had never felt kindness, or love, until the first night the woman had\nput her warm little hand on his head, and had snuggled her face close\ndown to his, while Thorpe--her husband--had cried out in horror. He had\nalmost buried his fangs in her white flesh, but in an instant her gentle\ntouch, and her sweet voice, had sent through him that wonderful thrill\nthat was his first knowledge of love. And now it was a man who was\ndriving him from her, away from the hand that had never held a club or a\nwhip, and he growled as he trotted deeper into the forest.\n\nHe came to the edge of a swamp as day broke. For a time he had been\nfilled with a strange uneasiness, and light did not quite dispel it. At\nlast he was free of men. He could detect nothing that reminded him of\ntheir hated presence in the air. But neither could he smell the presence\nof other dogs, of the sledge, the fire, of companionship and food, and\nso far back as he could remember they had always been a part of his\nlife.\n\nHere it was very quiet. The swamp lay in a hollow between two\nridge-mountains, and the spruce and cedar grew low and thick--so thick\nthat there was almost no snow under them, and day was like twilight. Two\nthings he began to miss more than all others--food and company. Both the\nwolf and the dog that was in him demanded the first, and that part of\nhim that was dog longed for the latter. To both desires the wolf blood\nthat was strong in him rose responsively. It told him that somewhere in\nthis silent world between the two ridges there was companionship, and\nthat all he had to do to find it was to sit back on his haunches, and\ncry out his loneliness. More than once something trembled in his deep\nchest, rose in his throat, and ended there in a whine. It was the wolf\nhowl, not yet quite born.\n\nFood came more easily than voice. Toward midday he cornered a big white\nrabbit under a log, and killed it. The warm flesh and blood was better\nthan frozen fish, or tallow and bran, and the feast he had gave him\nconfidence. That afternoon he chased many rabbits, and killed two more.\nUntil now, he had never known the delight of pursuing and killing at\nwill, even though he did not eat all he killed.\n\nBut there was no fight in the rabbits. They died too easily. They were\nvery sweet and tender to eat, when he was hungry, but the first thrill\nof killing them passed away after a time. He wanted something bigger. He\nno longer slunk along as if he were afraid, or as if he wanted to remain\nhidden. He held his head up. His back bristled. His tail swung free and\nbushy, like a wolf's. Every hair in his body quivered with the electric\nenergy of life and action. He traveled north and west. It was the call\nof early days--the days away up on the Mackenzie. The Mackenzie was a\nthousand miles away.\n\nHe came upon many trails in the snow that day, and sniffed the scents\nleft by the hoofs of moose and caribou, and the fur-padded feet of a\nlynx. He followed a fox, and the trail led him to a place shut in by\ntall spruce, where the snow was beaten down and reddened with blood.\nThere was an owl's head, feathers, wings and entrails lying here, and he\nknew that there were other hunters abroad besides himself.\n\nToward evening he came upon tracks in the snow that were very much like\nhis own. They were quite fresh, and there was a warm scent about them\nthat made him whine, and filled him again with that desire to fall back\nupon his haunches and send forth the wolf-cry. This desire grew stronger\nin him as the shadows of night deepened in the forest. He had traveled\nall day, but he was not tired. There was something about night, now that\nthere were no men near, that exhilarated him strangely. The wolf blood\nin him ran swifter and swifter. To-night it was clear. The sky was\nfilled with stars. The moon rose. And at last he settled back in the\nsnow and turned his head straight up to the spruce-tops, and the wolf\ncame out of him in a long mournful cry which quivered through the still\nnight for miles.\n\nFor a long time he sat and listened after that howl. He had found\nvoice--a voice with a strange new note in it, and it gave him still\ngreater confidence. He had expected an answer, but none came. He had\ntraveled in the face of the wind, and as he howled, a bull moose crashed\nthrough the scrub timber ahead of him, his horns rattling against the\ntrees like the tattoo of a clear birch club as he put distance between\nhimself and that cry.\n\nTwice Kazan howled before he went on, and he found joy in the practise\nof that new note. He came then to the foot of a rough ridge, and turned\nup out of the swamp to the top of it. The stars and the moon were nearer\nto him there, and on the other side of the ridge he looked down upon a\ngreat sweeping plain, with a frozen lake glistening in the moonlight,\nand a white river leading from it off into timber that was neither so\nthick nor so black as that in the swamp.\n\nAnd then every muscle in his body grew tense, and his blood leaped. From\nfar off in the plain there came a cry. It was _his_ cry--the wolf-cry.\nHis jaws snapped. His white fangs gleamed, and he growled deep in his\nthroat. He wanted to reply, but some strange instinct urged him not to.\nThat instinct of the wild was already becoming master of him. In the\nair, in the whispering of the spruce-tops, in the moon and the stars\nthemselves, there breathed a spirit which told him that what he had\nheard was the wolf-cry, but that it was not the wolf _call_.\n\nThe other came an hour later, clear and distinct, that same wailing howl\nat the beginning--but ending in a staccato of quick sharp yelps that\nstirred his blood at once into a fiery excitement that it had never\nknown before. The same instinct told him that this was the call--the\nhunt-cry. It urged him to come quickly. A few moments later it came\nagain, and this time there was a reply from close down along the foot of\nthe ridge, and another from so far away that Kazan could scarcely hear\nit. The hunt-pack was gathering for the night chase; but Kazan sat quiet\nand trembling.\n\nHe was not afraid, but he was not ready to go. The ridge seemed to split\nthe world for him. Down there it was new, and strange, and without men.\nFrom the other side something seemed pulling him back, and suddenly he\nturned his head and gazed back through the moonlit space behind him, and\nwhined. It was the dog-whine now. The woman was back there. He could\nhear her voice. He could feel the touch of her soft hand. He could see\nthe laughter in her face and eyes, the laughter that had made him warm\nand happy. She was calling to him through the forests, and he was torn\nbetween desire to answer that call, and desire to go down into the\nplain. For he could also see many men waiting for him with clubs, and he\ncould hear the cracking of whips, and feel the sting of their lashes.\n\nFor a long time he remained on the top of the ridge that divided his\nworld. And then, at last, he turned and went down into the plain.\n\nAll that night he kept close to the hunt-pack, but never quite\napproached it. This was fortunate for him. He still bore the scent of\ntraces, and of man. The pack would have torn him into pieces. The first\ninstinct of the wild is that of self-preservation. It may have been\nthis, a whisper back through the years of savage forebears, that made\nKazan roll in the snow now and then where the feet of the pack had trod\nthe thickest.\n\nThat night the pack killed a caribou on the edge of the lake, and\nfeasted until nearly dawn. Kazan hung in the face of the wind. The smell\nof blood and of warm flesh tickled his nostrils, and his sharp ears\ncould catch the cracking of bones. But the instinct was stronger than\nthe temptation.\n\nNot until broad day, when the pack had scattered far and wide over the\nplain, did he go boldly to the scene of the kill. He found nothing but\nan area of blood-reddened snow, covered with bones, entrails and torn\nbits of tough hide. But it was enough, and he rolled in it, and buried\nhis nose in what was left, and remained all that day close to it,\nsaturating himself with the scent of it.\n\nThat night, when the moon and the stars came out again, he sat back with\nfear and hesitation no longer in him, and announced himself to his new\ncomrades of the great plain.\n\nThe pack hunted again that night, or else it was a new pack that started\nmiles to the south, and came up with a doe caribou to the big frozen\nlake. The night was almost as clear as day, and from the edge of the\nforest Kazan first saw the caribou run out on the lake a third of a mile\naway. The pack was about a dozen strong, and had already split into the\nfatal horseshoe formation, the two leaders running almost abreast of the\nkill, and slowly closing in.\n\nWith a sharp yelp Kazan darted out into the moonlight. He was directly\nin the path of the fleeing doe, and bore down upon her with lightning\nspeed. Two hundred yards away the doe saw him, and swerved to the right,\nand the leader on that side met her with open jaws. Kazan was in with\nthe second leader, and leaped at the doe's soft throat. In a snarling\nmass the pack closed in from behind, and the doe went down, with Kazan\nhalf under her body, his fangs sunk deep in her jugular. She lay heavily\non him, but he did not lose his hold. It was his first big kill. His\nblood ran like fire. He snarled between his clamped teeth.\n\nNot until the last quiver had left the body over him did he pull himself\nout from under her chest and forelegs. He had killed a rabbit that day\nand was not hungry. So he sat back in the snow and waited, while the\nravenous pack tore at the dead doe. After a little he came nearer, nosed\nin between two of them, and was nipped for his intrusion.\n\nAs Kazan drew back, still hesitating to mix with his wild brothers, a\nbig gray form leaped out of the pack and drove straight for his throat.\nHe had just time to throw his shoulder to the attack, and for a moment\nthe two rolled over and over in the snow. They were up before the\nexcitement of sudden battle had drawn the pack from the feast. Slowly\nthey circled about each other, their white fangs bare, their yellowish\nbacks bristling like brushes. The fatal ring of wolves drew about the\nfighters.\n\nIt was not new to Kazan. A dozen times he had sat in rings like this,\nwaiting for the final moment. More than once he had fought for his life\nwithin the circle. It was the sledge-dog way of fighting. Unless man\ninterrupted with a club or a whip it always ended in death. Only one\nfighter could come out alive. Sometimes both died. And there was no man\nhere--only that fatal cordon of waiting white-fanged demons, ready to\nleap upon and tear to pieces the first of the fighters who was thrown\nupon his side or back. Kazan was a stranger, but he did not fear those\nthat hemmed him in. The one great law of the pack would compel them to\nbe fair.\n\nHe kept his eyes only on the big gray leader who had challenged him.\nShoulder to shoulder they continued to circle. Where a few moments\nbefore there had been the snapping of jaws and the rending of flesh\nthere was now silence. Soft-footed and soft-throated mongrel dogs from\nthe South would have snarled and growled, but Kazan and the wolf were\nstill, their ears laid forward instead of back, their tails free and\nbushy.\n\nSuddenly the wolf struck in with the swiftness of lightning, and his\njaws came together with the sharpness of steel striking steel. They\nmissed by an inch. In that same instant Kazan darted in to the side, and\nlike knives his teeth gashed the wolf's flank.\n\nThey circled again, their eyes growing redder, their lips drawn back\nuntil they seemed to have disappeared. And then Kazan leaped for that\ndeath-grip at the throat--and missed. It was only by an inch again, and\nthe wolf came back, as he had done, and laid open Kazan's flank so that\nthe blood ran down his leg and reddened the snow. The burn of that\nflank-wound told Kazan that his enemy was old in the game of fighting.\nHe crouched low, his head straight out, and his throat close to the\nsnow. It was a trick Kazan had learned in puppyhood--to shield his\nthroat, and wait.\n\nTwice the wolf circled about him, and Kazan pivoted slowly, his eyes\nhalf closed. A second time the wolf leaped, and Kazan threw up his\nterrible jaws, sure of that fatal grip just in front of the forelegs.\nHis teeth snapped on empty air. With the nimbleness of a cat the wolf\nhad gone completely over his back.\n\nThe trick had failed, and with a rumble of the dog-snarl in his throat,\nKazan reached the wolf in a single bound. They met breast to breast.\nTheir fangs clashed and with the whole weight of his body, Kazan flung\nhimself against the wolf's shoulders, cleared his jaws, and struck again\nfor the throat hold. It was another miss--by a hair's breadth--and\nbefore he could recover, the wolf's teeth were buried in the back of\nhis neck.\n\nFor the first time in his life Kazan felt the terror and the pain of the\ndeath-grip, and with a mighty effort he flung his head a little forward\nand snapped blindly. His powerful jaws closed on the wolf's foreleg,\nclose to the body. There was a cracking of bone and a crunching of\nflesh, and the circle of waiting wolves grew tense and alert. One or the\nother of the fighters was sure to go down before the holds were broken,\nand they but awaited that fatal fall as a signal to leap in to the\ndeath.\n\nOnly the thickness of hair and hide on the back of Kazan's neck, and the\ntoughness of his muscles, saved him from that terrible fate of the\nvanquished. The wolf's teeth sank deep, but not deep enough to reach the\nvital spot, and suddenly Kazan put every ounce of strength in his limbs\nto the effort, and flung himself up bodily from under his antagonist.\nThe grip on his neck relaxed, and with another rearing leap he tore\nhimself free.\n\nAs swift as a whip-lash he whirled on the broken-legged leader of the\npack and with the full rush and weight of his shoulders struck him\nfairly in the side. More deadly than the throat-grip had Kazan sometimes\nfound the lunge when delivered at the right moment. It was deadly now.\nThe big gray wolf lost his feet, rolled upon his back for an instant,\nand the pack rushed in, eager to rend the last of life from the leader\nwhose power had ceased to exist.\n\nFrom out of that gray, snarling, bloody-lipped mass, Kazan drew back,\npanting and bleeding. He was weak. There was a curious sickness in his\nhead. He wanted to lie down in the snow. But the old and infallible\ninstinct warned him not to betray that weakness. From out of the pack a\nslim, lithe, gray she-wolf came up to him, and lay down in the snow\nbefore him, and then rose swiftly and sniffed at his wounds.\n\nShe was young and strong and beautiful, but Kazan did not look at her.\nWhere the fight had been he was looking, at what little remained of the\nold leader. The pack had returned to the feast. He heard again the\ncracking of bones and the rending of flesh, and something told him that\nhereafter all the wilderness would hear and recognize his voice, and\nthat when he sat back on his haunches and called to the moon and the\nstars, those swift-footed hunters of the big plain would respond to it.\nHe circled twice about the caribou and the pack, and then trotted off to\nthe edge of the black spruce forest.\n\nWhen he reached the shadows he looked back. Gray Wolf was following him.\nShe was only a few yards behind. And now she came up to him, a little\ntimidly, and she, too, looked back to the dark blotch of life out on the\nlake. And as she stood there close beside him, Kazan sniffed at\nsomething in the air that was not the scent of blood, nor the perfume of\nthe balsam and spruce. It was a thing that seemed to come to him from\nthe clear stars, the cloudless moon, the strange and beautiful quiet of\nthe night itself. And its presence seemed to be a part of Gray Wolf.\n\nHe looked at her, and he found Gray Wolf's eyes alert and questioning.\nShe was young--so young that she seemed scarcely to have passed out of\npuppyhood. Her body was strong and slim and beautifully shaped. In the\nmoonlight the hair under her throat and along her back shone sleek and\nsoft. She whined at the red staring light in Kazan's eyes, and it was\nnot a puppy's whimper. Kazan moved toward her, and stood with his head\nover her back, facing the pack. He felt her trembling against his chest.\nHe looked at the moon and the stars again, the mystery of Gray Wolf and\nof the night throbbing in his blood.\n\nNot much of his life had been spent at the posts. Most of it had been on\nthe trail--in the traces--and the spirit of the mating season had only\nstirred him from afar. But it was very near now. Gray Wolf lifted her\nhead. Her soft muzzle touched the wound on his neck, and in the\ngentleness of that touch, in the low sound in her throat, Kazan felt and\nheard again that wonderful something that had come with the caress of\nthe woman's hand and the sound of her voice.\n\nHe turned, whining, his back bristling, his head high and defiant of the\nwilderness which he faced. Gray Wolf trotted close at his side as they\nentered into the gloom of the forest.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nTHE FIGHT IN THE SNOW\n\n\nThey found shelter that night under thick balsam, and when they lay down\non the soft carpet of needles which the snow had not covered, Gray Wolf\nsnuggled her warm body close to Kazan and licked his wounds. The day\nbroke with a velvety fall of snow, so white and thick that they could\nnot see a dozen leaps ahead of them in the open. It was quite warm, and\nso still that the whole world seemed filled with only the flutter and\nwhisper of the snowflakes. Through this day Kazan and Gray Wolf traveled\nside by side. Time and again he turned his head back to the ridge over\nwhich he had come, and Gray Wolf could not understand the strange note\nthat trembled in his throat.\n\nIn the afternoon they returned to what was left of the caribou doe on\nthe lake. In the edge of the forest Gray Wolf hung back. She did not yet\nknow the meaning of poison-baits, deadfalls and traps, but the instinct\nof numberless generations was in her veins, and it told her there was\ndanger in visiting a second time a thing that had grown cold in death.\n\nKazan had seen masters work about carcasses that the wolves had left. He\nhad seen them conceal traps cleverly, and roll little capsules of\nstrychnine in the fat of the entrails, and once he had put a foreleg in\na trap, and had experienced its sting and pain and deadly grip. But he\ndid not have Gray Wolf's fear. He urged her to accompany him to the\nwhite hummocks on the ice, and at last she went with him and sank back\nrestlessly on her haunches, while he dug out the bones and pieces of\nflesh that the snow had kept from freezing. But she would not eat, and\nat last Kazan went and sat on his haunches at her side, and with her\nlooked at what he had dug out from under the snow. He sniffed the air.\nHe could not smell danger, but Gray Wolf told him that it might be\nthere.\n\nShe told him many other things in the days and nights that followed. The\nthird night Kazan himself gathered the hunt-pack and led in the chase.\nThree times that month, before the moon left the skies, he led the\nchase, and each time there was a kill. But as the snows began to grow\nsofter under his feet he found a greater and greater companionship in\nGray Wolf, and they hunted alone, living on the big white rabbits. In\nall the world he had loved but two things, the girl with the shining\nhair and the hands that had caressed him--and Gray Wolf.\n\nHe did not leave the big plain, and often He took his mate to the top of\nthe ridge, and he would try to tell her what he had left back there.\nWith the dark nights the call of the woman became so strong upon him\nthat he was filled with a longing to go back, and take Gray Wolf with\nhim.\n\nSomething happened very soon after that. They were crossing the open\nplain one day when up on the face of the ridge Kazan saw something that\nmade his heart stand still. A man, with a dog-sledge and team, was\ncoming down into their world. The wind had not warned them, and suddenly\nKazan saw something glisten in the man's hands. He knew what it was. It\nwas the thing that spat fire and thunder, and killed.\n\nHe gave his warning to Gray Wolf, and they were off like the wind, side\nby side. And then came the _sound_--and Kazan's hatred of men burst\nforth in a snarl as he leaped. There was a queer humming over their\nheads. The sound from behind came again, and this time Gray Wolf gave a\nyelp of pain, and rolled over and over in the snow. She was on her feet\nagain in an instant, and Kazan dropped behind her, and ran there until\nthey reached the shelter of the timber. Gray Wolf lay down, and began\nlicking the wound in her shoulder. Kazan faced the ridge. The man was\ntaking up their trail. He stopped where Gray Wolf had fallen, and\nexamined the snow. Then he came on.\n\nKazan urged Gray Wolf to her feet, and they made for the thick swamp\nclose to the lake. All that day they kept in the face of the wind, and\nwhen Gray Wolf lay down Kazan stole back over their trail, watching and\nsniffing the air.\n\nFor days after that Gray Wolf ran lame, and when once they came upon the\nremains of an old camp, Kazan's teeth were bared in snarling hatred of\nthe man-scent that had been left behind. Growing in him there was a\ndesire for vengeance--vengeance for his own hurts, and for Gray Wolf's.\nHe tried to nose out the man-trail under the cover of fresh snow, and\nGray Wolf circled around him anxiously, and tried to lure him deeper\ninto the forest. At last he followed her sullenly. There was a savage\nredness in his eyes.\n\nThree days later the new moon came. And on the fifth night Kazan struck\na trail. It was fresh--so fresh that he stopped as suddenly as though\nstruck by a bullet when he ran upon it, and stood with every muscle in\nhis body quivering, and his hair on end. It was a man-trail. There were\nthe marks of the sledge, the dogs' feet, and the snow-shoeprints of his\nenemy.\n\nThen he threw up his head to the stars, and from his throat there rolled\nout over the wide plains the hunt-cry--the wild and savage call for the\npack. Never had he put the savagery in it that was there to-night. Again\nand again he sent forth that call, and then there came an answer and\nanother and still another, until Gray Wolf herself sat back on her\nhaunches and added her voice to Kazan's, and far out on the plain a\nwhite and haggard-faced man halted his exhausted dogs to listen, while a\nvoice said faintly from the sledge:\n\n\"The wolves, father. Are they coming--after us?\"\n\nThe man was silent. He was not young. The moon shone in his long white\nbeard, and added grotesquely to the height of his tall gaunt figure. A\ngirl had raised her head from a bearskin pillow on the sleigh. Her dark\neyes were filled beautifully with the starlight. She was pale. Her hair\nfell in a thick shining braid over her shoulder, and she was hugging\nsomething tightly to her breast.\n\n\"They're on the trail of something--probably a deer,\" said the man,\nlooking at the breech of his rifle. \"Don't worry, Jo. We'll stop at the\nnext bit of scrub and see if we can't find enough dry stuff for a\nfire.--Wee-ah-h-h-h, boys! Koosh--koosh--\" and he snapped his whip over\nthe backs of his team.\n\nFrom the bundle at the girl's breast there came a small wailing cry. And\nfar back in the plain there answered it the scattered voice of the pack.\n\nAt last Kazan was on the trail of vengeance. He ran slowly at first,\nwith Gray Wolf close beside him, pausing every three or four hundred\nyards to send forth the cry. A gray leaping form joined them from\nbehind. Another followed. Two came in from the side, and Kazan's\nsolitary howl gave place to the wild tongue of the pack. Numbers\ngrew, and with increasing number the pace became swifter.\nFour--six--seven--ten--fourteen, by the time the more open and\nwind-swept part of the plain was reached.\n\nIt was a strong pack, filled with old and fearless hunters. Gray Wolf\nwas the youngest, and she kept close to Kazan's shoulders. She could see\nnothing of his red-shot eyes and dripping jaws, and would not have\nunderstood if she had seen. But she could _feel_ and she was thrilled by\nthe spirit of that strange and mysterious savagery that had made Kazan\nforget all things but hurt and death.\n\nThe pack made no sound. There was only the panting of breath and the\nsoft fall of many feet. They ran swiftly and close. And always Kazan was\na leap ahead, with Gray Wolf nosing his shoulder.\n\nNever had he wanted to kill as he felt the desire in him to kill now.\nFor the first time he had no fear of man, no fear of the club, of the\nwhip, or of the thing that blazed forth fire and death. He ran more\nswiftly, in order to overtake them and give them battle sooner. All of\nthe pent-up madness of four years of slavery and abuse at the hands of\nmen broke loose in thin red streams of fire in his veins, and when at\nlast he saw a moving blotch far out on the plain ahead of him, the cry\nthat came out of his throat was one that Gray Wolf did not understand.\n\nThree hundred yards beyond that moving blotch was the thin line of\ntimber, and Kazan and his followers bore down swiftly. Half-way to the\ntimber they were almost upon it, and suddenly it stopped and became a\nblack and motionless shadow on the snow. From out of it there leaped\nthat lightning tongue of flame that Kazan had always dreaded, and he\nheard the hissing song of the death-bee over his head. He did not mind\nit now. He yelped sharply, and the wolves raced in until four of them\nwere neck-and-neck with him.\n\nA second flash--and the death-bee drove from breast to tail of a huge\ngray fighter close to Gray Wolf. A third--a fourth--a fifth spurt of\nthat fire from the black shadow, and Kazan himself felt a sudden swift\npassing of a red-hot thing along his shoulder, where the man's last\nbullet shaved off the hair and stung his flesh.\n\nThree of the pack had gone down under the fire of the rifle, and half of\nthe others were swinging to the right and the left. But Kazan drove\nstraight ahead. Faithfully Gray Wolf followed him.\n\nThe sledge-dogs had been freed from their traces, and before he could\nreach the man, whom he saw with his rifle held like a club in his hands,\nKazan was met by the fighting mass of them. He fought like a fiend, and\nthere was the strength and the fierceness of two mates in the mad\ngnashing of Gray Wolf's fangs. Two of the wolves rushed in, and Kazan\nheard the terrific, back-breaking thud of the rifle. To him it was the\n_club_. He wanted to reach it. He wanted to reach the man who held it,\nand he freed himself from the fighting mass of the dogs and sprang to\nthe sledge. For the first time he saw that there was something human on\nthe sledge, and in an instant he was upon it. He buried his jaws deep.\nThey sank in something soft and hairy, and he opened them for another\nlunge. And then he heard the voice! It was _her voice_! Every muscle in\nhis body stood still. He became suddenly like flesh turned to lifeless\nstone.\n\n_Her voice_! The bear rug was thrown back and what had been hidden under\nit he saw clearly now in the light of the moon and the stars. In him\ninstinct worked more swiftly than human brain could have given birth to\nreason. It was not _she_. But the voice was the same, and the white\ngirlish face so close to his own blood-reddened eyes held in it that\nsame mystery that he had learned to love. And he saw now that which she\nwas clutching to her breast, and there came from it a strange thrilling\ncry--and he knew that here on the sledge he had found not enmity and\ndeath, but that from which he had been driven away in the other world\nbeyond the ridge.\n\nIn a flash he turned. He snapped at Gray Wolf's flank, and she dropped\naway with a startled yelp. It had all happened in a moment, but the man\nwas almost down. Kazan leaped under his clubbed rifle and drove into the\nface of what was left of the pack. His fangs cut like knives. If he had\nfought like a demon against the dogs, he fought like ten demons now, and\nthe man--bleeding and ready to fall--staggered back to the sledge,\nmarveling at what was happening. For in Gray Wolf there was now the\ninstinct of matehood, and seeing Kazan tearing and righting the pack she\njoined him in the struggle which she could not understand.\n\nWhen it was over, Kazan and Gray Wolf were alone out on the plain. The\npack had slunk away into the night, and the same moon and stars that had\ngiven to Kazan the first knowledge of his birthright told him now that\nno longer would those wild brothers of the plains respond to his call\nwhen he howled into the sky.\n\nHe was hurt. And Gray Wolf was hurt, but not so badly as Kazan. He was\ntorn and bleeding. One of his legs was terribly bitten. After a time he\nsaw a fire in the edge of the forest. The old call was strong upon him.\nHe wanted to crawl in to it, and feel the girl's hand on his head, as\nhe had felt that other hand in the world beyond the ridge. He would have\ngone--and would have urged Gray Wolf to go with him--but the man was\nthere. He whined, and Gray Wolf thrust her warm muzzle against his neck.\nSomething told them both that they were outcasts, that the plains, and\nthe moon, and the stars were against them now, and they slunk into the\nshelter and the gloom of the forest.\n\nKazan could not go far. He could still smell the camp when he lay down.\nGray Wolf snuggled close to him. Gently she soothed with her soft tongue\nKazan's bleeding wounds. And Kazan, lifting his head, whined softly to\nthe stars.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nJOAN\n\n\nOn the edge of the cedar and spruce forest old Pierre Radisson built the\nfire. He was bleeding from a dozen wounds, where the fangs of the wolves\nhad reached to his flesh, and he felt in his breast that old and\nterrible pain, of which no one knew the meaning but himself. He dragged\nin log after log, piled them on the fire until the flames leaped tip to\nthe crisping needles of the limbs above, and heaped a supply close at\nhand for use later in the night.\n\nFrom the sledge Joan watched him, still wild-eyed and fearful, still\ntrembling. She was holding her baby close to her breast. Her long heavy\nhair smothered her shoulders and arms in a dark lustrous veil that\nglistened and rippled in the firelight when she moved. Her young face\nwas scarcely a woman's to-night, though she was a mother. She looked\nlike a child.\n\nOld Pierre laughed as he threw down the last armful of fuel, and stood\nbreathing hard.\n\n\"It was close, _ma cheri_\" he panted through his white beard. \"We were\nnearer to death out there on the plain than we will ever be again, I\nhope. But we are comfortable now, and warm. Eh? You are no longer\nafraid?\"\n\nHe sat down beside his daughter, and gently pulled back the soft fur\nthat enveloped the bundle she held in her arms. He could see one pink\ncheek of baby Joan. The eyes of Joan, the mother, were like stars.\n\n\"It was the baby who saved us,\" she whispered. \"The dogs were being torn\nto pieces by the wolves, and I saw them leaping upon you, when one of\nthem sprang to the sledge. At first I thought it was one of the dogs.\nBut it was a wolf. He tore once at us, and the bearskin saved us. He was\nalmost at my throat when baby cried, and then he stood there, his red\neyes a foot from us, and I could have sworn again that he was a dog. In\nan instant he turned, and was fighting the wolves. I saw him leap upon\none that was almost at your throat.\"\n\n\"He _was_ a dog,\" said old Pierre, holding out his hands to the warmth.\n\"They often wander away from the posts, and join the wolves. I have had\ndogs do that. _Ma cheri_, a dog is a dog all his life. Kicks, abuse,\neven the wolves can not change him--for long. He was one of the pack. He\ncame with them--to kill. But when he found _us_--\"\n\n\"He fought for us,\" breathed the girl. She gave him the bundle, and\nstood up, straight and tall and slim in the firelight. \"He fought for\nus--and he was terribly hurt,\" she said. \"I saw him drag himself away.\nFather, if he is out there--dying--\"\n\nPierre Radisson stood up. He coughed in a shuddering way, trying to\nstifle the sound under his beard. The fleck of crimson that came to his\nlips with the cough Joan did not see. She had seen nothing of it during\nthe six days they had been traveling up from the edge of civilization.\nBecause of that cough, and the stain that came with it, Pierre had made\nmore than ordinary haste.\n\n\"I have been thinking of that,\" he said. \"He was badly hurt, and I do\nnot think he went far. Here--take little Joan and sit close to the fire\nuntil I come back.\"\n\nThe moon and the stars were brilliant in the sky when he went out in the\nplain. A short distance from the edge of the timber-line he stood for a\nmoment upon the spot where the wolves had overtaken them an hour before.\nNot one of his four dogs had lived. The snow was red with their blood,\nand their bodies lay stiff where they had fallen under the pack. Pierre\nshuddered as he looked at them. If the wolves had not turned their first\nmad attack upon the dogs, what would have become of himself, Joan and\nthe baby? He turned away, with another of those hollow coughs that\nbrought the blood to his lips.\n\nA few yards to one side he found in the snow the trail of the strange\ndog that had come with the wolves, and had turned against them in that\nmoment when all seemed lost. It was not a clean running trail. It was\nmore of a furrow in the snow, and Pierre Radisson followed it, expecting\nto find the dog dead at the end of it.\n\nIn the sheltered spot to which he had dragged himself in the edge of the\nforest Kazan lay for a long time after the fight, alert and watchful.\nHe felt no very great pain. But he had lost the power to stand upon his\nlegs. His flanks seemed paralyzed. Gray Wolf crouched close at his side,\nsniffing the air. They could smell the camp, and Kazan could detect the\ntwo things that were there--_man_ and _woman_. He knew that the girl was\nthere, where he could see the glow of the firelight through the spruce\nand the cedars. He wanted to go to her. He wanted to drag himself close\nin to the fire, and take Gray Wolf with him, and listen to her voice,\nand feel the touch of her hand. But the man was there, and to him man\nhad always meant the club, the whip, pain, death.\n\nGray Wolf crouched close to his side, and whined softly as she urged\nKazan to flee deeper with her into the forest. At last she understood\nthat he could not move, and she ran nervously out into the plain, and\nback again, until her footprints were thick in the trail she made. The\ninstincts of matehood were strong in her. It was she who first saw\nPierre Radisson coming over their trail, and she ran swiftly back to\nKazan and gave the warning.\n\nThen Kazan caught the scent, and he saw the shadowy figure coming\nthrough the starlight. He tried to drag himself back, but he could move\nonly by inches. The man came rapidly nearer. Kazan caught the glisten of\nthe rifle in his hand. He heard his hollow cough, and the tread of his\nfeet in the snow. Gray Wolf crouched shoulder to shoulder with him,\ntrembling and showing her teeth. When Pierre had approached within fifty\nfeet of them she slunk back into the deeper shadows of the spruce.\n\nKazan's fangs were bared menacingly when Pierre stopped and looked down\nat him. With an effort he dragged himself to his feet, but fell back\ninto the snow again. The man leaned his rifle against a sapling and bent\nover him fearlessly. With a fierce growl Kazan snapped at his extended\nhands. To his surprise the man did not pick up a stick or a club. He\nheld out his hand again--cautiously--and spoke in a voice new to Kazan.\nThe dog snapped again, and growled.\n\nThe man persisted, talking to him all the time, and once his mittened\nhand touched Kazan's head, and escaped before the jaws could reach it.\nAgain and again the man reached out his hand, and three times Kazan felt\nthe touch of it, and there was neither threat nor hurt in it. At last\nPierre turned away and went back over the trail.\n\nWhen he was out of sight and hearing, Kazan whined, and the crest along\nhis spine flattened. He looked wistfully toward the glow of the fire.\nThe man had not hurt him, and the three-quarters of him that was dog\nwanted to follow.\n\nGray Wolf came back, and stood with stiffly planted forefeet at his\nside. She had never been this near to man before, except when the pack\nhad overtaken the sledge out on the plain. She could not understand.\nEvery instinct that was in her warned her that he was the most dangerous\nof all things, more to be feared than the strongest beasts, the storms,\nthe floods, cold and starvation. And yet this man had not harmed her\nmate. She sniffed at Kazan's back and head, where the mittened hand had\ntouched. Then she trotted back into the darkness again, for beyond the\nedge of the forest she once more saw moving life.\n\nThe man was returning, and with him was the girl. Her voice was soft\nand sweet, and there was about her the breath and sweetness of woman.\nThe man stood prepared, but not threatening.\n\n\"Be careful, Joan,\" he warned.\n\nShe dropped on her knees in the snow, just out of reach.\n\n\"Come, boy--come!\" she said gently. She held out her hand. Kazan's\nmuscles twitched. He moved an inch--two inches toward her. There was the\nold light in her eyes and face now, the love and gentleness he had known\nonce before, when another woman with shining hair and eyes had come into\nhis life. \"Come!\" she whispered as she saw him move, and she bent a\nlittle, reached a little farther with her hand, and at last touched his\nhead.\n\nPierre knelt beside her. He was proffering something, and Kazan smelled\nmeat. But it was the girl's hand that made him tremble and shiver, and\nwhen she drew back, urging him to follow her, he dragged himself\npainfully a foot or two through the snow. Not until then did the girl\nsee his mangled leg. In an instant she had forgotten all caution, and\nwas down close at his side.\n\n\"He can't walk,\" she cried, a sudden tremble in her voice. \"Look, _mon\np\u00c3\u00a8re!_ Here is a terrible cut. We must carry him.\"\n\n\"I guessed that much,\" replied Radisson. \"For that reason I brought the\nblanket. _Mon Dieu_, listen to that!\"\n\nFrom the darkness of the forest there came a low wailing cry.\n\nKazan lifted his head and a trembling whine answered in his throat. It\nwas Gray Wolf calling to him.\n\nIt was a miracle that Pierre Radisson should put the blanket about\nKazan, and carry him in to the camp, without scratch or bite. It was\nthis miracle that he achieved, with Joan's arm resting on Kazan's shaggy\nneck as she held one end of the blanket. They laid him down close to the\nfire, and after a little it was the man again who brought warm water and\nwashed away the blood from the torn leg, and then put something on it\nthat was soft and warm and soothing, and finally bound a cloth about it.\n\nAll this Was strange and new to Kazan. Pierre's hand, as well as the\ngirl's, stroked his head. It was the man who brought him a gruel of meal\nand tallow, and urged him to eat, while Joan sat with her chin in her\ntwo hands, looking at the dog, and talking to him. After this, when he\nwas quite comfortable, and no longer afraid, he heard a strange small\ncry from the furry bundle on the sledge that brought his head up with a\njerk.\n\nJoan saw the movement, and heard the low answering whimper in his\nthroat. She turned quickly to the bundle, talking and cooing to it as\nshe took it in her arms, and then she pulled back the bearskin so that\nKazan could see. He had never seen a baby before, and Joan held it out\nbefore him, so that he could look straight at it and see what a\nwonderful creature it was. Its little pink face stared steadily at\nKazan. Its tiny fists reached out, and it made queer little sounds at\nhim, and then suddenly it kicked and screamed with delight and laughed.\nAt those sounds Kazan's whole body relaxed, and he dragged himself to\nthe girl's feet.\n\n\"See, he likes the baby!\" she cried. \"_Mon p\u00c3\u00a8re_, we must give him a\nname. What shall it be?\"\n\n\"Wait till morning for that,\" replied the father. \"It is late, Joan. Go\ninto the tent, and sleep. We have no dogs now, and will travel slowly.\nSo we must start early.\"\n\nWith her hand on the tent-flap, Joan, turned.\n\n\"He came with the wolves,\" she said. \"Let us call him Wolf.\" With one\narm she was holding the little Joan. The other she stretched out to\nKazan. \"Wolf! Wolf!\" she called softly.\n\nKazan's eyes were on her. He knew that she was speaking to him, and he\ndrew himself a foot toward her.\n\n\"He knows it already!\" she cried. \"Good night, _mon p\u00c3\u00a8re_.\"\n\nFor a long time after she had gone into the tent, old Pierre Radisson\nsat on the edge of the sledge, facing the fire, with Kazan at his feet.\nSuddenly the silence was broken again by Gray Wolf's lonely howl deep in\nthe forest. Kazan lifted his head and whined.\n\n\"She's calling for you, boy,\" said Pierre understandingly.\n\nHe coughed, and clutched a hand to his breast, where the pain seemed\nrending him.\n\n\"Frost-bitten lung,\" he said, speaking straight at Kazan. \"Got it early\nin the winter, up at Fond du Lac. Hope we'll get home--in time--with the\nkids.\"\n\nIn the loneliness and emptiness of the big northern wilderness one falls\ninto the habit of talking to one's self. But Kazan's head was alert, and\nhis eyes watchful, so Pierre spoke to him.\n\n\"We've got to get them home, and there's only you and me to do it,\" he\nsaid, twisting his beard. Suddenly he clenched his fists.\n\nHis hollow racking cough convulsed him again.\n\n\"Home!\" he panted, clutching his chest. \"It's eighty miles straight\nnorth--to the Churchill--and I pray to God we'll get there--with the\nkids--before my lungs give out.\"\n\nHe rose to his feet, and staggered a little as he walked. There was a\ncollar about Kazan's neck, and he chained him to the sledge. After that\nhe dragged three or four small logs upon the fire, and went quietly into\nthe tent where Joan and the baby were already asleep. Several times\nthat night Kazan heard the distant voice of Gray Wolf calling for him,\nbut something told him that he must not answer it now. Toward dawn Gray\nWolf came close in to the camp, and for the first time Kazan replied to\nher.\n\nHis howl awakened the man. He came out of the tent, peered for a few\nmoments up at the sky, built up the fire, and began to prepare\nbreakfast. He patted Kazan on the head, and gave him a chunk of meat.\nJoan came out a few moments later, leaving the baby asleep in the tent.\nShe ran up and kissed Pierre, and then dropped down on her knees beside\nKazan, and talked to him almost as he had heard her talk to the baby.\nWhen she jumped up to help her father, Kazan followed her, and when Joan\nsaw him standing firmly upon his legs she gave a cry of pleasure.\n\nIt was a strange journey that began into the North that day. Pierre\nRadisson emptied the sledge of everything but the tent, blankets, food\nand the furry nest for baby Joan. Then he harnessed himself in the\ntraces and dragged the sledge over the snow. He coughed incessantly.\n\n\"It's a cough I've had half the winter,\" lied Pierre, careful that Joan\nsaw no sign of blood on his lips or beard. \"I'll keep in the cabin for a\nweek when we get home.\"\n\nEven Kazan, with that strange beast knowledge which man, unable to\nexplain, calls instinct, knew that what he said was not the truth.\nPerhaps it was largely because he had heard other men cough like this,\nand that for generations his sledge-dog ancestors had heard men cough as\nRadisson coughed--and had learned what followed it.\n\nMore than once he had scented death in tepees and cabins, which he had\nnot entered, and more than once he had sniffed at the mystery of death\nthat was not quite present, but near--just as he had caught at a\ndistance the subtle warning of storm and of fire. And that strange thing\nseemed to be very near to him now, as he followed at the end of his\nchain behind the sledge. It made him restless, and half a dozen times,\nwhen the sledge stopped, he sniffed at the bit of humanity buried in the\nbearskin. Each time that he did this Joan was quickly at his side, and\ntwice she patted his scarred and grizzled head until every drop of\nblood in his body leaped riotously with a joy which his body did not\nreveal.\n\nThis day the chief thing that he came to understand was that the little\ncreature on the sledge was very precious to the girl who stroked his\nhead and talked to him, and that it was very helpless. He learned, too,\nthat Joan was most delighted, and that her voice was softer and thrilled\nhim more deeply, when he paid attention to that little, warm, living\nthing in the bearskin.\n\nFor a long time after they made camp Pierre Radisson sat beside the\nfire. To-night he did not smoke. He stared straight into the flames.\nWhen at last he rose to go into the tent with the girl and the baby, he\nbent over Kazan and examined his hurt.\n\n\"You've got to work in the traces to-morrow, boy,\" he said. \"We must\nmake the river by to-morrow night. If we don't--\"\n\nHe did not finish. He was choking back one of those tearing coughs when\nthe tent-flap dropped behind him. Kazan lay stiff and alert, his eyes\nfilled with a strange anxiety. He did not like to see Radisson enter the\ntent, for stronger than ever there hung that oppressive mystery in the\nair about him, and it seemed to be a part of Pierre.\n\nThree times that night he heard faithful Gray Wolf calling for him deep\nin the forest, and each time he answered her. Toward dawn she came in\nclose to camp. Once he caught the scent of her when she circled around\nin the wind, and he tugged and whined at the end of his chain, hoping\nthat she would come in and lie down at his side. But no sooner had\nRadisson moved in the tent than Gray Wolf was gone. The man's face was\nthinner, and his eyes were redder this morning. His cough was not so\nloud or so rending. It was like a wheeze, as if something had given way\ninside, and before the girl came out he clutched his hands often at his\nthroat. Joan's face whitened when she saw him. Anxiety gave way to fear\nin her eyes. Pierre Radisson laughed when she flung her arms about him,\nand coughed to prove that what he said was true.\n\n\"You see the cough is not so bad, my Joan,\" he said. \"It is breaking up.\nYou can not have forgotten, _ma cheri_? It always leaves one red-eyed\nand weak.\"\n\nIt was a cold bleak dark day that followed, and through it Kazan and\nthe man tugged at the fore of the sledge, with Joan following in the\ntrail behind. Kazan's wound no longer hurt him. He pulled steadily with\nall his splendid strength, and the man never lashed him once, but patted\nhim with his mittened hand on head and back. The day grew steadily\ndarker and in the tops of the trees there was the low moaning of a\nstorm.\n\nDarkness and the coming of the storm did not drive Pierre Radisson into\ncamp. \"We must reach the river,\" he said to himself over and over again.\n\"We must reach the river--we must reach the river--\" And he steadily\nurged Kazan on to greater effort, while his own strength at the end of\nthe traces grew less.\n\nIt had begun to storm when Pierre stopped to build a fire at noon. The\nsnow fell straight down in a white deluge so thick that it hid the tree\ntrunks fifty yards away. Pierre laughed when Joan shivered and snuggled\nclose up to him with the baby in her arms. He waited only an hour, and\nthen fastened Kazan in the traces again, and buckled the straps once\nmore about his own waist. In the silent gloom that was almost night\nPierre carried his compass in his hand, and at last, late in the\nafternoon, they came to a break in the timber-line, and ahead of them\nlay a plain, across which Radisson pointed an exultant hand.\n\n\"There's the river, Joan,\" he said, his voice faint and husky. \"We can\ncamp here now and wait for the storm to pass.\"\n\nUnder a thick clump of spruce he put up the tent, and then began\ngathering fire-wood. Joan helped him. As soon as they had boiled coffee\nand eaten a supper of meat and toasted biscuits, Joan went into the tent\nand dropped exhausted on her thick bed of balsam boughs, wrapping\nherself and the baby up close in the skins and blankets. To-night she\nhad no word for Kazan. And Pierre was glad that she was too tired to sit\nbeside the fire and talk. And yet--\n\nKazan's alert eyes saw Pierre start suddenly. He rose from his seat on\nthe sledge and went to the tent. He drew back the flap and thrust in his\nhead and shoulders.\n\n\"Asleep, Joan?\" he asked.\n\n\"Almost, father. Won't you please come--soon?\"\n\n\"After I smoke,\" he said. \"Are you comfortable?\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm so tired--and--sleepy--\"\n\nPierre laughed softly. In the darkness he was gripping at his throat.\n\n\"We're almost home, Joan. That is our river out there--the Little\nBeaver. If I should run away and leave you to-night you could follow it\nright to our cabin. It's only forty miles. Do you hear?\"\n\n\"Yes--I know--\"\n\n\"Forty miles--straight down the river. You couldn't lose yourself, Joan.\nOnly you'd have to be careful of air-holes in the ice.\"\n\n\"Won't you come to bed, father? You're tired--and almost sick.\"\n\n\"Yes--after I smoke,\" he repeated. \"Joan, will you keep reminding me\nto-morrow of the air-holes? I might forget. You can always tell them,\nfor the snow and the crust over them are whiter than that on the rest of\nthe ice, and like a sponge. Will you remember--the airholes--\"\n\n\"Yes-s-s-s--\"\n\nPierre dropped the tent-flap and returned to the fire. He staggered as\nhe walked.\n\n\"Good night, boy,\" he said. \"Guess I'd better go in with the kids. Two\ndays more--forty miles--two days--\"\n\nKazan watched him as he entered the tent. He laid his weight against the\nend of his chain until the collar shut off his wind. His legs and back\ntwitched. In that tent where Radisson had gone were Joan and the baby.\nHe knew that Pierre would not hurt them, but he knew also that with\nPierre Radisson something terrible and impending was hovering very near\nto them. He wanted the man outside--by the fire--where he could lie\nstill, and watch him.\n\nIn the tent there was silence. Nearer to him than before came Gray\nWolf's cry. Each night she was calling earlier, and coming closer to the\ncamp. He wanted her very near to him to-night, but he did not even whine\nin response. He dared not break that strange silence in the tent. He lay\nstill for a long time, tired and lame from the day's journey, but\nsleepless. The fire burned lower; the wind in the tree-tops died away;\nand the thick gray clouds rolled like a massive curtain from under the\nskies. The stars began to glow white and metallic, and from far in the\nNorth there came faintly a crisping moaning sound, like steel\nsleigh-runners running over frosty snow--the mysterious monotone of the\nNorthern Lights. After that it grew steadily and swiftly colder.\n\nTo-night Gray Wolf did not compass herself by the direction of the wind.\nShe followed like a sneaking shadow over the trail Pierre Radisson had\nmade, and when Kazan heard her again, long after midnight, he lay with,\nhis head erect, and his body rigid, save for a curious twitching of his\nmuscles. There was a new note in Gray Wolf's voice, a wailing note in\nwhich there was more than the mate-call. It was The Message. And at the\nsound of it Kazan rose from out of his silence and his fear, and with\nhis head turned straight up to the sky he howled as the wild dogs of the\nNorth howl before the tepees of masters who are newly dead.\n\nPierre Radisson was dead.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nOUT OF THE BLIZZARD\n\n\nIt was dawn when the baby snuggled close to Joan's warm breast and\nawakened her with its cry of hunger. She opened her eyes, brushed back\nthe thick hair from her face, and could see where the shadowy form of\nher father was lying at the other side of the tent. He was very quiet,\nand she was pleased that he was still sleeping. She knew that the day\nbefore he had been very near to exhaustion, and so for half an hour\nlonger she lay quiet, cooing softly to the baby Joan. Then she arose\ncautiously, tucked the baby in the warm blankets and furs, put on her\nheavier garments, and went outside.\n\nBy this time it was broad day, and she breathed a sigh of relief when\nshe saw that the storm had passed. It was bitterly cold. It seemed to\nher that she had never known it to be so cold in all her life. The fire\nwas completely out. Kazan was huddled in a round ball, his nose tucked\nunder his body. He raised his head, shivering, as Joan came out. With\nher heavily moccasined foot Joan scattered the ashes and charred sticks\nwhere the fire had been. There was not a spark left. In returning to the\ntent she stopped for a moment beside Kazan, and patted his shaggy head.\n\n\"Poor Wolf!\" she said. \"I wish I had given you one of the bearskins!\"\n\nShe threw back the tent-flap and entered. For the first time she saw her\nfather's face in the light--and outside, Kazan heard the terrible\nmoaning cry that broke from her lips. No one could have looked at Pierre\nRadisson's face once--and not have understood.\n\nAfter that one agonizing cry, Joan flung herself upon her father's\nbreast, sobbing so softly that even Kazan's sharp ears heard no sound.\nShe remained there in her grief until every vital energy of womanhood\nand motherhood in her girlish body was roused to action by the wailing\ncry of baby Joan. Then she sprang to her feet and ran out through the\ntent opening. Kazan tugged at the end of his chain to meet her, but she\nsaw nothing of him now. The terror of the wilderness is greater than\nthat of death, and in an instant it had fallen upon Joan. It was not\nbecause of fear for herself. It was the baby. The wailing cries from the\ntent pierced her like knife-thrusts.\n\nAnd then, all at once, there came to her what old Pierre had said the\nnight before--his words about the river, the air-holes, the home forty\nmiles away. \"_You couldn't lose yourself, Joan_\" He had guessed what\nmight happen.\n\nShe bundled the baby deep in the furs and returned to the fire-bed. Her\none thought now was that they must have fire. She made a little pile of\nbirch-bark, covered it with half-burned bits of wood, and went into the\ntent for the matches. Pierre Radisson carried them in a water-proof box\nin a pocket of his bearskin coat. She sobbed as she kneeled beside him\nagain, and obtained the box. As the fire flared up she added other bits\nof wood, and then some of the larger pieces that Pierre had dragged into\ncamp. The fire gave her courage. Forty miles--and the river led to their\nhome! She must make that, with the baby and Wolf. For the first time\nshe turned to him, and spoke his name as she put her hand on his head.\nAfter that she gave him a chunk of meat which she thawed out over the\nfire, and melted the snow for tea. She was not hungry, but she recalled\nhow her father had made her eat four or five times a day, so she forced\nherself to make a breakfast of a biscuit, a shred of meat and as much\nhot tea as she could drink.\n\nThe terrible hour she dreaded followed that. She wrapped blankets\nclosely about her father's body, and tied them with babiche cord. After\nthat she piled all the furs and blankets that remained on the sledge\nclose to the fire, and snuggled baby Joan deep down in them. Pulling\ndown the tent was a task. The ropes were stiff and frozen, and when she\nhad finished, one of her hands was bleeding. She piled the tent on the\nsledge, and then, half, covering her face, turned and looked back.\n\nPierre Radisson lay on his balsam bed, with nothing over him now but the\ngray sky and the spruce-tops. Kazan stood stiff-legged and sniffed the\nair. His spine bristled when Joan went back slowly and kneeled beside\nthe blanket-wrapped object. When she returned to him her face was white\nand tense, and now there was a strange and terrible look in her eyes as\nshe stared out across the barren. She put him in the traces, and\nfastened about her slender waist the strap that Pierre had used. Thus\nthey struck out for the river, floundering knee-deep in the freshly\nfallen and drifted snow. Half-way Joan stumbled in a drift and fell, her\nloose hair flying in a shimmering veil over the snow. With a mighty pull\nKazan was at her side, and his cold muzzle touched her face as she drew\nherself to her feet. For a moment Joan took his shaggy head between her\ntwo hands.\n\n\"Wolf!\" she moaned. \"Oh, Wolf!\"\n\nShe went on, her breath coming pantingly now, even from her brief\nexertion. The snow was not so deep on the ice of the river. But a wind\nwas rising. It came from the north and east, straight in her face, and\nJoan bowed her head as she pulled with Kazan. Half a mile down the river\nshe stopped, and no longer could she repress the hopelessness that rose\nto her lips in a sobbing choking cry. Forty miles! She clutched her\nhands at her breast, and stood breathing like one who had been beaten,\nher back to the wind. The baby was quiet. Joan went back and peered down\nunder the furs, and what she saw there spurred her on again almost\nfiercely. Twice she stumbled to her knees in the drifts during the next\nquarter of a mile.\n\nAfter that there was a stretch of wind-swept ice, and Kazan pulled the\nsledge alone. Joan walked at his side. There was a pain in her chest. A\nthousand needles seemed pricking her face, and suddenly she remembered\nthe thermometer. She exposed it for a time on the top of the tent. When\nshe looked at it a few minutes later it was thirty degrees below zero.\nForty miles! And her father had told her that she could make it--and\ncould not lose herself! But she did not know that even her father would\nhave been afraid to face the north that day, with the temperature at\nthirty below, and a moaning wind bringing the first warning of a\nblizzard.\n\nThe timber was far behind her now. Ahead there was nothing but the\npitiless barren, and the timber beyond that was hidden by the gray gloom\nof the day. If there had been trees, Joan's heart would not have choked\nso with terror. But there was nothing--nothing but that gray ghostly\ngloom, with the rim of the sky touching the earth a mile away.\n\nThe snow grew heavy under her feet again. Always she was watching for\nthose treacherous, frost-coated traps in the ice her father had spoken\nof. But she found now that all the ice and snow looked alike to her, and\nthat there was a growing pain back of her eyes. It was the intense cold.\n\nThe river widened into a small lake, and here the wind struck her in the\nface with such force that her weight was taken from the strap, and Kazan\ndragged the sledge alone. A few inches of snow impeded her as much as a\nfoot had done before. Little by little she dropped back. Kazan forged to\nher side, every ounce of his magnificent strength in the traces. By the\ntime they were on the river channel again, Joan was at the back of the\nsledge, following in the trail made by Kazan. She was powerless to help\nhim. She felt more and more the leaden weight of her legs. There was but\none hope--and that was the forest. If they did not reach it soon, within\nhalf an hour, she would be able to go no farther. Over and over again\nshe moaned a prayer for her baby as she struggled on. She fell in the\nsnow-drifts. Kazan and the sledge became only a dark blotch to her. And\nthen, all at once, she saw that they were leaving her. They were not\nmore than twenty feet ahead of her--but the blotch seemed to be a vast\ndistance away. Every bit of life and strength in her body was now bent\nupon reaching the sledge--and baby Joan.\n\nIt seemed an interminable time before she gained. With the sledge only\nsix feet ahead of her she struggled for what seemed to her to be an hour\nbefore she could reach out and touch it. With a moan she flung herself\nforward, and fell upon it. She no longer heard the wailing of the storm.\nShe no longer felt discomfort. With her face in the furs under which\nbaby Joan was buried, there came to her with swiftness and joy a vision\nof warmth and home. And then the vision faded away, and was followed by\ndeep night.\n\nKazan stopped in the trail. He came back then and sat down upon his\nhaunches beside her, waiting for her to move and speak. But she was\nvery still. He thrust his nose into her loose hair. A whine rose in his\nthroat, and suddenly he raised his head and sniffed in the face of the\nwind. Something came to him with that wind. He muzzled Joan again, hut\nshe did not stir. Then he went forward, and stood in his traces, ready\nfor the pull, and looked hack at her. Still she did not move or speak,\nand Kazan's whine gave place to a sharp excited bark.\n\nThe strange thing in the wind came to him stronger for a moment. He\nbegan to pull. The sledge-runners had frozen to the snow, and it took\nevery ounce of his strength to free them. Twice during the next five\nminutes he stopped and sniffed the air. The third time that he halted,\nin a drift of snow, he returned to Joan's side again, and whined to\nawaken her. Then he tugged again at the end of his traces, and foot by\nfoot he dragged the sledge through the drift. Beyond the drift there was\na stretch of clear ice, and here Kazan rested. During a lull in the wind\nthe scent came to him stronger than before.\n\nAt the end of the clear ice was a narrow break in the shore, where a\ncreek ran into the main stream. If Joan had been conscious she would\nhave urged him straight ahead. But Kazan turned into the break, and for\nten minutes he struggled through the snow without a rest, whining more\nand more frequently, until at last the whine broke into a joyous bark.\nAhead of him, close to the creek, was a small cabin. Smoke was rising\nout of the chimney. It was the scent of smoke that had come to him in\nthe wind. A hard level slope reached to the cabin door, and with the\nlast strength that was in him Kazan dragged his burden up that. Then he\nsettled himself back beside Joan, lifted his shaggy head to the dark sky\nand howled.\n\nA moment later the door opened. A man came out. Kazan's reddened,\nsnow-shot eyes followed him watchfully as he ran to the sledge. He heard\nhis startled exclamation as he bent over Joan. In another lull of the\nwind there came from out of the mass of furs on the sledge the wailing,\nhalf-smothered voice of baby Joan.\n\nA deep sigh of relief heaved up from Kazan's chest. He was exhausted.\nHis strength was gone. His feet were torn and bleeding. But the voice\nof baby Joan filled him with a strange happiness, and he lay down in his\ntraces, while the man carried Joan and the baby into the life and warmth\nof the cabin.\n\nA few minutes later the man reappeared. He was not old, like Pierre\nRadisson. He came close to Kazan, and looked down at him.\n\n\"My God,\" he said. \"And you did that--_alone!_\"\n\nHe bent down fearlessly, unfastened him from the traces, and led him\ntoward the cabin door. Kazan hesitated but once--almost on the\nthreshold. He turned his head, swift and alert. From out of the moaning\nand wailing of the storm it seemed to him that for a moment he had heard\nthe voice of Gray Wolf.\n\nThen the cabin door closed behind him.\n\nBack in a shadowy corner of the cabin he lay, while the man prepared\nsomething over a hot stove for Joan. It was a long time before Joan rose\nfrom the cot on which the man had placed her. After that Kazan heard her\nsobbing; and then the man made her eat, and for a time they talked. Then\nthe stranger hung up a big blanket in front of the bunk, and sat down\nclose to the stove. Quietly Kazan slipped along the wall, and crept\nunder the bunk. For a long time he could hear the sobbing breath of the\ngirl. Then all was still.\n\nThe next morning he slipped out through the door when the man opened it,\nand sped swiftly into the forest. Half a mile away he found the trail of\nGray Wolf, and called to her. From the frozen river came her reply, and\nhe went to her.\n\nVainly Gray Wolf tried to lure him back into their old haunts--away from\nthe cabin and the scent of man. Late that morning the man harnessed his\ndogs, and from the fringe of the forest Kazan saw him tuck Joan and the\nbaby among the furs on the sledge, as old Pierre had done. All that day\nhe followed in the trail of the team, with Gray Wolf slinking behind\nhim. They traveled until dark; and then, under the stars and the moon\nthat had followed the storm, the man still urged on his team. It was\ndeep in the night when they came to another cabin, and the man beat upon\nthe door. A light, the opening of the door, the joyous welcome of a\nman's voice, Joan's sobbing cry--Kazan heard these from the shadows in\nwhich he was hidden, and then slipped back to Gray Wolf.\n\nIn the days and weeks that followed Joan's home-coming the lure of the\ncabin and of the woman's hand held Kazan. As he had tolerated Pierre, so\nnow he tolerated the younger man who lived with Joan and the baby. He\nknew that the man was very dear to Joan, and that the baby was very dear\nto him, as it was to the girl. It was not until the third day that Joan\nsucceeded in coaxing him into the cabin--and that was the day on which\nthe man returned with the dead and frozen body of Pierre. It was Joan's\nhusband who first found the name on the collar he wore, and they began\ncalling him Kazan.\n\nHalf a mile away, at the summit of a huge mass of rock which the Indians\ncalled the Sun Rock, he and Gray Wolf had found a home; and from here\nthey went down to their hunts on the plain, and often the girl's voice\nreached up to them, calling, \"_Kazan! Kazan! Kazan_!\"\n\nThrough all the long winter Kazan hovered thus between the lure of Joan\nand the cabin--and Gray Wolf.\n\nThen came Spring--and the Great Change.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nTHE GREAT CHANGE\n\n\nThe rocks, the ridges and the valleys were taking on a warmer glow. The\npoplar buds were ready to burst. The scent of balsam and of spruce grew\nheavier in the air each day, and all through the wilderness, in plain\nand forest, there was the rippling murmur of the spring floods finding\ntheir way to Hudson's Bay. In that great bay there was the rumble and\ncrash of the ice fields thundering down in the early break-up through\nthe Roes Welcome--the doorway to the Arctic, and for that reason there\nstill came with the April wind an occasional sharp breath of winter.\n\nKazan had sheltered himself against that wind. Not a breath of air\nstirred in the sunny spot the wolf-dog had chosen for himself. He was\nmore comfortable than he had been at any time during the six months of\nterrible winter--and as he slept he dreamed.\n\nGray Wolf, his wild mate, lay near him, flat on her belly, her forepaws\nreaching out, her eyes and nostrils as keen and alert as the smell of\nman could make them. For there was that smell of man, as well as of\nbalsam and spruce, in the warm spring air. She gazed anxiously and\nsometimes steadily, at Kazan as he slept. Her own gray spine stiffened\nwhen she saw the tawny hair along Kazan's back bristle at some dream\nvision. She whined softly as his upper lip snarled back, showing his\nlong white fangs. But for the most part Kazan lay quiet, save for the\nmuscular twitchings of legs, shoulders and muzzle, which always tell\nwhen a dog is dreaming; and as he dreamed there came to the door of the\ncabin out on the plain a blue-eyed girl-woman, with a big brown braid\nover her shoulder, who called through the cup of her hands, \"Kazan,\nKazan, Kazan!\"\n\nThe voice reached faintly to the top of the Sun Rock, and Gray Wolf\nflattened her ears. Kazan stirred, and in another instant he was awake\nand on his feet. He leaped to an outcropping ledge, sniffing the air and\nlooking far out over the plain that lay below them.\n\nOver the plain the woman's voice came to them again, and Kazan ran to\nthe edge of the rock and whined. Gray Wolf stepped softly to his side\nand laid her muzzle on his shoulder. She had grown to know what the\nVoice meant. Day and night she feared it, more than she feared the scent\nor sound of man.\n\nSince she had given up the pack and her old life for Kazan, the Voice\nhad become Gray Wolf's greatest enemy, and she hated it. It took Kazan\nfrom her. And wherever it went, Kazan followed.\n\nNight after night it robbed her of her mate, and left her to wander\nalone under the stars and the moon, keeping faithfully to her\nloneliness, and never once responding with her own tongue to the\nhunt-calls of her wild brothers and sisters in the forests and out on\nthe plains. Usually she would snarl at the Voice, and sometimes nip\nKazan lightly to show her displeasure. But to-day, as the Voice came a\nthird time, she slunk back into the darkness of a fissure between two\nrocks, and Kazan saw only the fiery glow of her eyes.\n\nKazan ran nervously to the trail their feet had worn up to the top of\nthe Sun Rock, and stood undecided. All day, and yesterday, he had been\nuneasy and disturbed. Whatever it was that stirred him seemed to be in\nthe air, for he could not see it or hear it or scent it. But he could\n_feel_ it. He went to the fissure and sniffed at Gray Wolf. Usually she\nwhined coaxingly. But her response to-day was to draw back her lips\nuntil he could see her white fangs.\n\nA fourth tune the Voice came to them faintly, and she snapped fiercely\nat some unseen thing in the darkness between the two rocks. Kazan went\nagain to the trail, still hesitating. Then he began to go down. It was a\nnarrow winding trail, worn only by the pads and claws of animals, for\nthe Sun Rock was a huge crag that rose almost sheer up for a hundred\nfeet above the tops of the spruce and balsam, its bald crest catching\nthe first gleams of the sun in the morning and the last glow of it in\nthe evening. Gray Wolf had first led Kazan to the security of the\nretreat at the top of the rock.\n\nWhen he reached the bottom he no longer hesitated, but darted swiftly in\nthe direction of the cabin. Because of that instinct of the wild that\nwas still in him, he always approached the cabin with caution. He never\ngave warning, and for a moment Joan was startled when she looked up from\nher baby and saw Kazan's shaggy head and shoulders in the open door. The\nbaby struggled and kicked in her delight, and held out her two hands\nwith cooing cries to Kazan. Joan, too, held out a hand.\n\n\"Kazan!\" she cried softly. \"Come in, Kazan!\"\n\nSlowly the wild red light in Kazan's eyes softened. He put a forefoot on\nthe sill, and stood there, while the girl urged him again. Suddenly his\nlegs seemed to sink a little under him, his tail drooped and he slunk in\nwith that doggish air of having committed a crime. The creatures he\nloved were in the cabin, but the cabin itself he hated. He hated all\ncabins, for they all breathed of the club and the whip and bondage. Like\nall sledge-dogs he preferred the open snow for a bed, and the\nspruce-tops for shelter.\n\nJoan dropped her hand to his head, and at its touch there thrilled\nthrough him that strange joy that was his reward for leaving Gray Wolf\nand the wild. Slowly he raised his head until his black muzzle rested on\nher lap, and he closed his eyes while that wonderful little creature\nthat mystified him so--the baby--prodded him with her tiny feet, and\npulled his tawny hair. He loved these baby-maulings even more than the\ntouch of Joan's hand.\n\nMotionless, sphinx-like, undemonstrative in every muscle of his body,\nKazan stood, scarcely breathing. More than once this lack of\ndemonstration had urged Joan's husband to warn her. But the wolf that\nwas in Kazan, his wild aloofness, even his mating with Gray Wolf had\nmade her love him more. She understood, and had faith in him.\n\nIn the days of the last snow Kazan had proved himself. A neighboring\ntrapper had run over with his team, and the baby Joan had toddled up to\none of the big huskies. There was a fierce snap of jaws, a scream of\nhorror from Joan, a shout from the men as they leaped toward the pack.\nBut Kazan was ahead of them all. In a gray streak that traveled with the\nspeed of a bullet he was at the big husky's throat. When they pulled him\noff, the husky was dead. Joan thought of that now, as the baby kicked\nand tousled Kazan's head.\n\n\"Good old Kazan,\" she cried softly, putting her face down close to him.\n\"We're glad you came, Kazan, for we're going to be alone to-night--baby\nand I. Daddy's gone to the post, and you must care for us while he's\naway.\"\n\nShe tickled his nose with the end of her long shining braid. This always\ndelighted the baby, for in spite of his stoicism Kazan had to sniff and\nsometimes to sneeze, and twig his ears. And it pleased him, too. He\nloved the sweet scent of Joan's hair.\n\n\"And you'd fight for us, if you had to, wouldn't you?\" she went on. Then\nshe rose quietly. \"I must close the door,\" she said. \"I don't want you\nto go away again to-day, Kazan. You must stay with us.\"\n\nKazan went off to his corner, and lay down. Just as there had been some\nstrange thing at the top of the Sun Rock to disturb him that day, so now\nthere was a mystery that disturbed him in the cabin. He sniffed the air,\ntrying to fathom its secret. Whatever it was, it seemed to make his\nmistress different, too. And she was digging out all sorts of odds and\nends of things about the cabin, and doing them up in packages. Late that\nnight, before she went to bed, Joan came and snuggled her hand close\ndown beside him for a few moments.\n\n\"We're going away,\" she whispered, and there was a curious tremble that\nwas almost a sob in her voice. \"We're going home, Kazan. We're going\naway down where his people live--where they have churches, and cities,\nand music, and all the beautiful things in the world. And we're going to\ntake _you_, Kazan!\"\n\nKazan didn't understand. But he was happy at having the woman so near to\nhim, and talking to him. At these times he forgot Gray Wolf. The dog\nthat was in him surged over his quarter-strain of wildness, and the\nwoman and the baby alone filled his world. But after Joan had gone to\nher bed, and all was quiet in the cabin, his old uneasiness returned. He\nrose to his feet and moved stealthily about the cabin, sniffing at the\nwalls, the door and the things his mistress had done into packages. A\nlow whine rose in his throat. Joan, half asleep, heard it, and murmured:\n\"Be quiet, Kazan. Go to sleep--go to sleep--\"\n\nLong after that, Kazan stood rigid in the center of the room, listening,\ntrembling. And faintly he heard, far away, the wailing cry of, Gray\nWolf. But to-night it was not the cry of loneliness. It sent a thrill\nthrough him. He ran to the door, and whined, but Joan was deep in\nslumber and did not hear him. Once more he heard the cry, and only once.\nThen the night grew still. He crouched down near the door.\n\nJoan found him there, still watchful, still listening, when she awoke in\nthe early morning. She came to open the door for him, and in a moment he\nwas gone. His feet seemed scarcely to touch the earth as he sped in the\ndirection of the Sun Rock. Across the plain he could see the cap of it\nalready painted with a golden glow.\n\nHe came to the narrow winding trail, and wormed his way up it swiftly.\n\nGray Wolf was not at the top to greet him. But he could smell her, and\nthe scent of that other thing was strong in the air. His muscles\ntightened; his legs grew tense. Deep down in his chest there began the\nlow rumble of a growl. He knew now what that strange thing was that had\nhaunted him, and made him uneasy. It was _life_. Something that lived\nand breathed had invaded the home which he and Gray Wolf had chosen. He\nbared his long fangs, and a snarl of defiance drew back his lips.\nStiff-legged, prepared to spring, his neck and head reaching out, he\napproached the two rocks between which Gray Wolf had crept the night\nbefore. She was still there. And with her was _something else_. After a\nmoment the tenseness left Kazan's body. His bristling crest drooped\nuntil it lay flat. His ears shot forward, and he put his head and\nshoulders between the two rocks, and whined softly. And Gray Wolf\nwhined. Slowly Kazan backed out, and faced the rising sun. Then he lay\ndown, so that his body shielded I the entrance to the chamber between\nthe rocks.\n\nGray Wolf was a mother.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nTHE TRAGEDY ON SUN ROCK\n\n\nAll that day Kazan guarded the top of the Sun Rock. Fate, and the fear\nand brutality of masters, had heretofore kept him from fatherhood, and\nhe was puzzled. Something told him now that he belonged to the Sun Rock,\nand not to the cabin. The call that came to him from over the plain was\nnot so strong. At dusk Gray Wolf came out from her retreat, and slunk to\nhis side, whimpering, and nipped gently at his shaggy neck. It was the\nold instinct of his fathers that made him respond by caressing Gray\nWolf's face with his tongue. Then Gray Wolf's jaws opened, and she\nlaughed in short panting breaths, as if she had been hard run. She was\nhappy, and as they heard a little snuffling sound from between the\nrocks, Kazan wagged his tail, and Gray Wolf darted back to her young.\n\nThe babyish cry and its effect upon Gray Wolf taught Kazan his first\nlesson in fatherhood. Instinct again told him that Gray Wolf could not\ngo down to the hunt with him now--that she must stay at the top of the\nSun Rock. So when the moon rose he went down alone, and toward dawn\nreturned with a big white rabbit between his jaws. It was the wild in\nhim that made him do this, and Gray Wolf ate ravenously. Then he knew\nthat each night hereafter he must hunt for Gray Wolf--and the little\nwhimpering creatures hidden between the two rocks.\n\nThe next day, and still the next, he did not go to the cabin, though he\nheard the voices of both the man and the woman calling him. On the fifth\nhe went down, and Joan and the baby were so glad that the woman hugged\nhim, and the baby kicked and laughed and screamed at him, while the man\nstood by cautiously, watching their demonstrations with a gleam of\ndisapprobation in his eyes.\n\n\"I'm afraid of him,\" he told Joan for the hundredth time. \"That's the\nwolf-gleam in his eyes. He's of a treacherous breed. Sometimes I wish\nwe'd never brought him home.\"\n\n\"If we hadn't--where would the baby--have gone?\" Joan reminded him, a\nlittle catch in her voice.\n\n\"I had almost forgotten that,\" said her husband. \"Kazan, you old devil,\nI guess I love you, too.\" He laid his hand caressingly on Kazan's head.\n\"Wonder how he'll take to life down there?\" he asked. \"He has always\nbeen used to the forests. It'll seem mighty strange.\"\n\n\"And so--have I--always been used to the forests,\" whispered Joan. \"I\nguess that's why I love Kazan--next to you and the baby. Kazan--dear old\nKazan!\"\n\nThis time Kazan felt and scented more of that mysterious change in the\ncabin. Joan and her husband talked incessantly of their plans when they\nwere together; and when the man was away Joan talked to the baby, and to\nhim. And each time that he came down to the cabin during the week that\nfollowed, he grew more and more restless, until at last the man noticed\nthe change in him.\n\n\"I believe he knows,\" he said to Joan one evening. \"I believe he knows\nwe're preparing to leave.\" Then he added: \"The river was rising again\nto-day. It will be another week before we can start, perhaps longer.\"\n\nThat same night the moon flooded the top of the Sun Rock with a golden\nlight, and out into the glow of it came Gray Wolf, with her three little\nwhelps toddling behind her. There was much about these soft little balls\nthat tumbled about him and snuggled in his tawny coat that reminded\nKazan of the baby. At times they made the same queer, soft little\nsounds, and they staggered about on their four little legs just as\nhelplessly as baby Joan made her way about on two. He did not fondle\nthem, as Gray Wolf did, but the touch of them, and their babyish\nwhimperings, filled him with a kind of pleasure that he had never\nexperienced before.\n\nThe moon was straight above them, and the night was almost as bright as\nday, when he went down again to hunt for Gray Wolf. At the foot of the\nrock a big white rabbit popped up ahead of him, and he gave chase. For\nhalf a mile he pursued, until the wolf instinct in him rose over the\ndog, and he gave up the futile race. A deer he might have overtaken, but\nsmall game the wolf must hunt as the fox hunts it, and he began to slip\nthrough the thickets slowly and as quietly as a shadow. He was a mile\nfrom the Sun Rock when two quick leaps put Gray Wolf's supper between\nhis jaws. He trotted back slowly, dropping the big seven-pound snow-shoe\nhare now and then to rest.\n\nWhen he came to the narrow trail that led to the top of the Sun Rock he\nstopped. In that trail was the warm scent of strange feet. The rabbit\nfell from his jaws. Every hair in his body was suddenly electrified into\nlife. What he scented was not the scent of a rabbit, a marten or a\nporcupine. Fang and claw had climbed the path ahead of him. And then,\ncoming faintly to him from the top of the rock, he heard sounds which\nsent him up with a terrible whining cry. When he reached the summit he\nsaw in the white moonlight a scene that stopped him for a single moment.\nClose to the edge of the sheer fall to the rocks, fifty feet below, Gray\nWolf was engaged in a death-struggle with a huge gray lynx. She was\ndown--and under, and from her there came a sudden sharp terrible cry of\npain.\n\nKazan flew across the rock. His attack was the swift silent assault of\nthe wolf, combined with the greater courage, the fury and the strategy\nof the husky. Another husky would have died in that first attack. But\nthe lynx was not a dog or a wolf. It was \"Mow-lee, the swift,\" as the\nSarcees had named it--the quickest creature in the wilderness. Kazan's\ninch-long fangs should have sunk deep in its jugular. But in a\nfractional part of a second the lynx had thrown itself back like a huge\nsoft ball, and Kazan's teeth buried themselves in the flesh of its neck\ninstead of the jugular. And Kazan was not now fighting the fangs of a\nwolf in the pack, or of another husky. He was fighting claws--claws that\nripped like twenty razor-edged knives, and which even a jugular hold\ncould not stop.\n\nOnce he had fought a lynx in a trap, and he had not forgotten the lesson\nthe battle had taught him. He fought to pull the lynx _down_, instead of\nforcing it on its back, as he would have done with another dog or a\nwolf. He knew that when on its back the fierce cat was most dangerous.\nOne rip of its powerful hindfeet could disembowel him.\n\nBehind him he heard Gray Wolf sobbing and crying, and he knew that she\nwas terribly hurt. He was filled with the rage and strength of two dogs,\nand his teeth met through the flesh and hide of the cat's throat. But\nthe big lynx escaped death by half an inch. It would take a fresh grip\nto reach the jugular, and suddenly Kazan made the deadly lunge. There\nwas an instant's freedom for the lynx, and in that moment it flung\nitself back, and Kazan gripped at its throat--_on top_.\n\nThe cat's claws ripped through his flesh, cutting open his side--a\nlittle too high to kill. Another stroke and they would have cut to his\nvitals. But they had struggled close to the edge of the rock wall, and\nsuddenly, without a snarl or a cry, they rolled over. It was fifty or\nsixty feet to the rocks of the ledge below, and even as they pitched\nover and over in the fall, Kazan's teeth sank deeper. They struck with\nterrific force, Kazan uppermost. The shock sent him half a dozen feet\nfrom his enemy. He was up like a flash, dizzy, snarling, on the\ndefensive. The lynx lay limp and motionless where it had fallen. Kazan\ncame nearer, still prepared, and sniffed cautiously. Something told him\nthat the fight was over. He turned and dragged himself slowly along the\nledge to the trail, and returned to Gray Wolf.\n\nGray Wolf was no longer in the moonlight. Close to the two rocks lay the\nlimp and lifeless little bodies of the three pups. The lynx had torn\nthem to pieces. With a whine of grief Kazan approached the two boulders\nand thrust his head between them. Gray Wolf was there, crying to herself\nin that terrible sobbing way. He went in, and began to lick her bleeding\nshoulders and head. All the rest of that night she whimpered with pain.\nWith dawn she dragged herself out to the lifeless little bodies on the\nrock.\n\nAnd then Kazan saw the terrible work of the lynx. For Gray Wolf was\nblind--not for a day or a night, but blind for all time. A gloom that no\nsun could break had become her shroud. And perhaps again it was that\ninstinct of animal creation, which often is more wonderful than man's\nreason, that told Kazan what had happened. For he knew now that she was\nhelpless--more helpless than the little creatures that had gamboled in\nthe moonlight a few hours before. He remained close beside her all\nthat day.\n\n[Illustration: Kazan gripped at its throat]\n\nVainly that day did Joan call for Kazan. Her voice rose to the Sun Rock,\nand Gray Wolf's head snuggled closer to Kazan, and Kazan's ears dropped\nback, and he licked her wounds. Late in the afternoon Kazan left Gray\nWolf long enough to run to the bottom of the trail and bring up the\nsnow-shoe rabbit. Gray Wolf muzzled the fur and flesh, but would not\neat. Still a little later Kazan urged her to follow him to the trail. He\nno longer wanted to stay at the top of the Sun Rock, and he no longer\nwanted Gray Wolf to stay there. Step by step he drew her down the\nwinding path away from her dead puppies. She would move only when he was\nvery near her--so near that she could touch his scarred flank with her\nnose.\n\nThey came at last to the point in the trail where they had to leap down\na distance of three or four feet from the edge of a rock, and here Kazan\nsaw how utterly helpless Gray Wolf had become. She whined, and crouched\ntwenty times before she dared make the spring, and then she jumped\nstiff-legged, and fell in a heap at Kazan's feet. After this Kazan did\nnot have to urge her so hard, for the fall impinged on her the fact that\nshe was safe only when her muzzle touched her mate's flank. She followed\nhim obediently when they reached the plain, trotting with her\nforeshoulder to his hip.\n\nKazan was heading for a thicket in the creek bottom half a mile away,\nand a dozen times in that short distance Gray Wolf stumbled and fell.\nAnd each time that she fell Kazan learned a little more of the\nlimitations of blindness. Once he sprang off in pursuit of a rabbit, but\nhe had not taken twenty leaps when he stopped and looked back. Gray Wolf\nhad not moved an inch. She stood motionless, sniffing the air--waiting\nfor him! For a full minute Kazan stood, also waiting. Then he returned\nto her. Ever after this he returned to the point where he had left Gray\nWolf, knowing that he would find her there.\n\nAll that day they remained in the thicket. In the afternoon he visited\nthe cabin. Joan and her husband were there, and both saw at once\nKazan's torn side and his lacerated head and shoulders.\n\n\"Pretty near a finish fight for him,\" said the man, after he had\nexamined him. \"It was either a lynx or a bear. Another wolf could not do\nthat.\"\n\nFor half an hour Joan worked over him, talking to him all the time, and\nfondling him with her soft hands. She bathed his wounds in warm water,\nand then covered them with a healing salve, and Kazan was filled again\nwith that old restful desire to remain with her always, and never to go\nback into the forests. For an hour she let him lie on the edge of her\ndress, with his nose touching her foot, while she worked on baby things.\nThen she rose to prepare supper, and Kazan got up--a little wearily--and\nwent to the door. Gray Wolf and the gloom of the night were calling him,\nand he answered that call with a slouch of his shoulders and a drooping\nhead. Its old thrill was gone. He watched his chance, and went out\nthrough the door. The moon had risen when he rejoined Gray Wolf. She\ngreeted his return with a low whine of joy, and muzzled him with her\nblind face. In her helplessness she looked happier than Kazan in all his\nstrength.\n\nFrom now on, during the days that followed, it was a last great fight\nbetween blind and faithful Gray Wolf and the woman. If Joan had known of\nwhat lay in the thicket, if she could once have seen the poor creature\nto whom Kazan was now all life--the sun, the stars, the moon, and\nfood--she would have helped Gray Wolf. But as it was she tried to lure\nKazan more and more to the cabin, and slowly she won.\n\nAt last the great day came, eight days after the fight on the Sun Rock.\nKazan had taken Gray Wolf to a wooded point on the river two days\nbefore, and there he had left her the preceding night when he went to\nthe cabin. This time a stout babiche thong was tied to the collar round\nhis neck, and he was fastened to a staple in the log wall. Joan and her\nhusband were up before it was light next day. The sun was just rising\nwhen they all went out, the man carrying the baby, and Joan leading him.\nJoan turned and locked the cabin door, and Kazan heard a sob in her\nthroat as they followed the man down to the river. The big canoe was\npacked and waiting. Joan got in first, with the baby. Then, still\nholding the babiche thong, she drew Kazan up close to her, so that he\nlay with his weight against her.\n\nThe sun fell warmly on Kazan's back as they shoved off, and he closed\nhis eyes, and rested his head on Joan's lap. Her hand fell softly on his\nshoulder. He heard again that sound which the man could not hear, the\nbroken sob in her throat, as the canoe moved slowly down to the wooded\npoint.\n\nJoan waved her hand back at the cabin, just disappearing behind the\ntrees.\n\n\"Good-by!\" she cried sadly. \"Good-by--\" And then she buried her face\nclose down to Kazan and the baby, and sobbed.\n\nThe man stopped paddling.\n\n\"You're not sorry--Joan?\" he asked.\n\nThey were drifting past the point now, and the scent of Gray Wolf came\nto Kazan's nostrils, rousing him, and bringing a low whine from his\nthroat.\n\n\"You're not sorry--we're going?\" Joan shook her head.\n\n\"No,\" she replied. \"Only I've--always lived here--in the forests--and\nthey're--home!\"\n\nThe point with its white finger of sand, was behind them now. And Kazan\nwas standing rigid, facing it. The man called to him, and Joan lifted\nher head. She, too, saw the point, and suddenly the babiche leash\nslipped from her fingers, and a strange light leaped into her blue eyes\nas she saw what stood at the end of that white tip of sand. It was Gray\nWolf. Her blind eyes were turned toward Kazan. At last Gray Wolf, the\nfaithful, understood. Scent told her what her eyes could not see. Kazan\nand the man-smell were together. And they were going--going--going--\n\n\"Look!\" whispered Joan.\n\nThe man turned. Gray Wolf's forefeet were in the water. And now, as the\ncanoe drifted farther and farther away, she settled back on her\nhaunches, raised her head to the sun which she could not see and gave\nher last long wailing cry for Kazan.\n\nThe canoe lurched. A tawny body shot through the air--and Kazan was\ngone.\n\nThe man reached forward for his rifle. Joan's hand stopped him. Her\nface was white.\n\n\"Let him go back to her! Let him go--let him go!\" she cried. \"It is his\nplace--with her.\"\n\nAnd Kazan reaching the shore, shook the water from his shaggy hair, and\nlooked for the last time toward the woman. The canoe was drifting slowly\naround the first bend. A moment more and it had disappeared. Gray Wolf\nhad won.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nTHE DAYS OF FIRE\n\n\nFrom the night of the terrible fight with the big gray lynx on the top\nof the Sun Rock, Kazan remembered less and less vividly the old days\nwhen he had been a sledge-dog, and the leader of a pack. He would never\nquite forget them, and always there would stand out certain memories\nfrom among the rest, like fires cutting the blackness of night. But as\nman dates events from his birth, his marriage, his freedom from a\nbondage, or some foundation-step in his career, so all things seemed to\nKazan to begin with two tragedies which had followed one fast upon the\nother after the birth of Gray Wolf's pups.\n\nThe first was the fight on the Sun Rock, when the big gray lynx had\nblinded his beautiful wolf mate for all time, and had torn her pups into\npieces. He in turn had killed the lynx. But Gray Wolf was still blind.\nVengeance had not been able to give her sight. She could no longer hunt\nwith him, as they had hunted with the wild wolf-packs out on the plain,\nand in the dark forests. So at thought of that night he always snarled,\nand his lips curled back to reveal his inch-long fangs.\n\nThe other tragedy was the going of Joan, her baby and her husband.\nSomething more infallible than reason told Kazan that they would not\ncome back. Brightest of all the pictures that remained with him was that\nof the sunny morning when the woman and the baby he loved, and the man\nhe endured because of them, had gone away in the canoe, and often he\nwould go to the point, and gaze longingly down-stream, where he had\nleaped from the canoe to return to his blind mate.\n\nSo Kazan's life seemed now to be made up chiefly of three things: his\nhatred of everything that bore the scent or mark of the lynx, his\ngrieving for Joan and the baby, and Gray Wolf. It was natural that the\nstrongest passion in him should be his hatred of the lynx, for not only\nGray Wolf's blindness and the death of the pups, but even the loss of\nthe woman and the baby he laid to that fatal struggle on the Sun Rock.\nFrom that hour he became the deadliest enemy of the lynx tribe. Wherever\nhe struck the scent of the big gray cat he was turned into a snarling\ndemon, and his hatred grew day by day, as he became more completely a\npart of the wild.\n\nHe found that Gray Wolf was more necessary to him now than she had ever\nbeen since the day she had left the wolf-pack for him. He was\nthree-quarters dog, and the dog-part of him demanded companionship.\nThere was only Gray Wolf to give him that now. They were alone.\nCivilization was four hundred miles south of them. The nearest Hudson's\nBay post was sixty miles to the west. Often, in the days of the woman\nand the baby, Gray Wolf had spent her nights alone out in the forest,\nwaiting and calling for Kazan. Now it was Kazan who was lonely and\nuneasy when he was away from her side.\n\nIn her blindness Gray Wolf could no longer hunt with her mate. But\ngradually a new code of understanding grew up between them, and through\nher blindness they learned many things that they had not known before.\nBy early summer Gray Wolf could travel with Kazan, if he did not move\ntoo swiftly. She ran at his flank, with her shoulder or muzzle touching\nhim, and Kazan learned not to leap, but to trot. Very quickly he found\nthat he must choose the easiest trails for Gray Wolf's feet. When they\ncame to a space to be bridged by a leap, he would muzzle Gray Wolf and\nwhine, and she would stand with ears alert--listening. Then Kazan would\ntake the leap, and she understood the distance she had to cover. She\nalways over-leaped, which was a good fault.\n\nIn another way, and one that was destined to serve them many times in\nthe future, she became of greater help than ever to Kazan. Scent and\nhearing entirely took the place of sight. Each day developed these\nsenses more and more, and at the same time there developed between them\nthe dumb language whereby she could impress upon Kazan what she had\ndiscovered by scent or sound. It became a curious habit of Kazan's\nalways to look at Gray Wolf when they stopped to listen, or to scent the\nair.\n\nAfter the fight on the Sun Rock, Kazan had taken his blind mate to a\nthick clump of spruce and balsam in the river-bottom, where they\nremained until early summer. Every day for weeks Kazan went to the cabin\nwhere Joan and the baby--and the man--had been. For a long time he went\nhopefully, looking each day or night to see some sign of life there. But\nthe door was never open. The boards and saplings at the windows always\nremained. Never a spiral of smoke rose from the clay chimney. Grass and\nvines began to grow in the path. And fainter and fainter grew that scent\nwhich Kazan could still find about it--the scent of man, of the woman,\nthe baby.\n\nOne day he found a little baby moccasin under one of the closed windows.\nIt was old, and worn out, and blackened by snow and rain, but he lay\ndown beside it, and remained there for a long time, while the baby\nJoan--a thousand miles away--was playing with the strange toys of\ncivilization. Then he returned to Gray Wolf among the spruce and balsam.\n\nThe cabin was the one place to which Gray Wolf would not follow him. At\nall other times she was at his side. Now that she had become accustomed\nto blindness, she even accompanied him on his hunts, until he struck\ngame, and began the chase. Then she would wait for him. Kazan usually\nhunted the big snow-shoe rabbits. But one night he ran down and killed a\nyoung doe. The kill was too heavy to drag to Gray Wolf, so he returned\nto where she was waiting for him and guided her to the feast. In many\nways they became more and more inseparable as the summer lengthened,\nuntil at last, through all the wilderness, their footprints were always\ntwo by two and never one by one.\n\nThen came the great fire.\n\nGray Wolf caught the scent of it when it was still two days to the west.\nThe sun that night went down in a lurid cloud. The moon, drifting into\nthe west, became blood red. When it dropped behind the wilderness in\nthis manner, the Indians called it the Bleeding Moon, and the air was\nfilled with omens.\n\nAll the next day Gray Wolf was nervous, and toward noon Kazan caught in\nthe air the warning that she had sensed many hours ahead of him.\nSteadily the scent grew stronger, and by the middle of the afternoon the\nsun was veiled by a film of smoke.\n\nThe flight of the wild things from the triangle of forest between the\njunctions of the Pipestone and Cree Rivers would have begun then, but\nthe wind shifted. It was a fatal shift. The fire was raging from the\nwest and south. Then the wind swept straight eastward, carrying the\nsmoke with it, and during this breathing spell all the wild creatures in\nthe triangle between the two rivers waited. This gave the fire time to\nsweep completely, across the base of the forest triangle, cutting off\nthe last trails of escape.\n\nThen the wind shifted again, and the fire swept north. The head of the\ntriangle became a death-trap. All through the night the southern sky was\nfilled with a lurid glow, and by morning the heat and smoke and ash were\nsuffocating.\n\nPanic-striken, Kazan searched vainly for a means of escape. Not for an\ninstant did he leave Gray Wolf. It would have been easy for him to swim\nacross either of the two streams, for he was three-quarters dog. But at\nthe first touch of water on her paws, Gray Wolf drew back, shrinking.\nLike all her breed, she would face fire and death before water. Kazan\nurged. A dozen times he leaped in, and swam out into the stream. But\nGray Wolf would come no farther than she could wade.\n\nThey could hear the distant murmuring roar of the fire now. Ahead of it\ncame the wild things. Moose, caribou and deer plunged into the water of\nthe streams and swam to the safety of the opposite side. Out upon a\nwhite finger of sand lumbered a big black bear with two cubs, and even\nthe cubs took to the water, and swam across easily. Kazan watched them,\nand whined to Gray Wolf.\n\nAnd then out upon that white finger of sand came other things that\ndreaded the water as Gray Wolf dreaded it: a big fat porcupine, a sleek\nlittle marten, a fisher-cat that sniffed the air and wailed like a\nchild. Those things that could not or would not swim outnumbered the\nothers three to one. Hundreds of little ermine scurried along the shore\nlike rats, their squeaking little voices sounding incessantly; foxes ran\nswiftly along the banks, seeking a tree or a windfall that might bridge\nthe water for them; the lynx snarled and faced the fire; and Gray\nWolf's own tribe--the wolves--dared take no deeper step than she.\n\nDripping and panting, and half choked by heat and smoke, Kazan came to\nGray Wolf's side. There was but one refuge left near them, and that was\nthe sand-bar. It reached out for fifty feet into the stream. Quickly he\nled his blind mate toward it. As they came through the low bush to the\nriver-bed, something stopped them both. To their nostrils had come the\nscent of a deadlier enemy than fire. A lynx had taken possession of the\nsand-bar, and was crouching at the end of it. Three porcupines had\ndragged themselves into the edge of the water, and lay there like balls,\ntheir quills alert and quivering. A fisher-cat was snarling at the lynx.\nAnd the lynx, with ears laid back, watched Kazan and Gray Wolf as they\nbegan the invasion of the sand-bar.\n\nFaithful Gray Wolf was full of fight, and she sprang shoulder to\nshoulder with Kazan, her fangs bared. With an angry snap, Kazan drove\nher back, and she stood quivering and whining while he advanced.\nLight-footed, his pointed ears forward, no menace or threat in his\nattitude, he advanced. It was the deadly advance of the husky trained\nin battle, skilled in the art of killing. A man from civilization would\nhave said that the dog was approaching the lynx with friendly\nintentions. But the lynx understood. It was the old feud of many\ngenerations--made deadlier now by Kazan's memory of that night at the\ntop of the Sun Rock.\n\nInstinct told the fisher-cat what was coming, and it crouched low and\nflat; the porcupines, scolding like little children at the presence of\nenemies and the thickening clouds of smoke, thrust their quills still\nmore erect. The lynx lay on its belly, like a cat, its hindquarters\ntwitching, and gathered for the spring. Kazan's feet seemed scarcely to\ntouch the sand as he circled lightly around it. The lynx pivoted as he\ncircled, and then it shot in a round snarling ball over the eight feet\nof space that separated them.\n\nKazan did not leap aside. He made no effort to escape the attack, but\nmet it fairly with the full force of his shoulders, as sledge-dog meets\nsledge-dog. He was ten pounds heavier than the lynx, and for a moment\nthe big loose-jointed cat with its twenty knife-like claws was thrown\non its side. Like a flash Kazan took advantage of the moment, and drove\nfor the back of the cat's neck.\n\nIn that same moment blind Gray Wolf leaped in with a snarling cry, and\nfighting under Kazan's belly, she fastened her jaws in one of the cat's\nhindlegs. The bone snapped. The lynx, twice outweighed, leaped backward,\ndragging both Kazan and Gray Wolf. It fell back down on one of the\nporcupines, and a hundred quills drove into its body. Another leap and\nit was free--fleeing into the face of the smoke. Kazan did not pursue.\nGray Wolf came to his side and licked his neck, where fresh blood was\ncrimsoning his tawny hide. The fisher-cat lay as if dead, watching them\nwith fierce little black eyes. The porcupines continued to chatter, as\nif begging for mercy. And then a thick black suffocating pall of smoke\ndrove low over the sand-bar and with it came air that was furnace-hot.\n\nAt the uttermost end of the sand-bar Kazan and Gray Wolf rolled\nthemselves into balls and thrust their heads under their bodies. The\nfire was very near now. The roar of it was like that of a great\ncataract, with now and then a louder crash of falling trees. The air\nwas filled with ash and burning sparks, and twice Kazan drew forth his\nhead to snap at blazing embers that fell upon and seared him like hot\nirons.\n\nClose along the edge of the stream grew thick green bush, and when the\nfire reached this, it burned more slowly, and the heat grew less. Still,\nit was a long time before Kazan and Gray Wolf could draw forth their\nheads and breathe more freely. Then they found that the finger of sand\nreaching out into the river had saved them. Everywhere in that triangle\nbetween the two rivers the world had turned black, and was hot\nunderfoot.\n\nThe smoke cleared away. The wind changed again, and swung down cool and\nfresh from the west and north. The fisher-cat was the first to move\ncautiously back to the forests that had been, but the porcupines were\nstill rolled into balls when Gray Wolf and Kazan left the sand-bar. They\nbegan to travel up-stream, and before night came, their feet were sore\nfrom hot ash and burning embers.\n\nThe moon was strange and foreboding that night, like a spatter of blood\nin the sky, and through the long silent hours there was not even the\nhoot of an owl to give a sign that life still existed where yesterday\nhad been a paradise of wild things. Kazan knew that there was nothing to\nhunt, and they continued to travel all that night. With dawn they struck\na narrow swamp along the edge of the stream. Here beavers had built a\ndam, and they were able to cross over into the green country on the\nopposite side. For another day and another night they traveled westward,\nand this brought them into the thick country of swamp and timber along\nthe Waterfound.\n\nAnd as Kazan and Gray Wolf came from the west, there came from the\nHudson's Bay post to the east a slim dark-faced French half-breed by the\nname of Henri Loti, the most famous lynx hunter in all the Hudson's Bay\ncountry. He was prospecting for \"signs,\" and he found them in abundance\nalong the Waterfound. It was a game paradise, and the snow-shoe rabbit\nabounded in thousands. As a consequence, the lynxes were thick, and\nHenri built his trapping shack, and then returned to the post to wait\nuntil the first snows fell, when he would come back with his team,\nsupplies and traps.\n\nAnd up from the south, at this same time, there was slowly working his\nway by canoe and trail a young university zoologist who was gathering\nmaterial for a book on _The Reasoning of the Wild_. His name was Paul\nWeyman, and he had made arrangements to spend a part of the winter with\nHenri Loti, the half-breed. He brought with him plenty of paper, a\ncamera and the photograph of a girl. His only weapon was a pocket-knife.\n\nAnd meanwhile Kazan and Gray Wolf found the home they were seeking in a\nthick swamp five or six miles from the cabin that Henri Loti had built.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nALWAYS TWO BY TWO\n\n\nIt was January when a guide from the post brought Paul Weyman to Henri\nLoti's cabin on the Waterfound. He was a man of thirty-two or three,\nfull of the red-blooded life that made Henri like him at once. If this\nhad not been the case, the first few days in the cabin might have been\nunpleasant, for Henri was in bad humor. He told Weyman about it their\nfirst night, as they were smoking pipes alongside the redly glowing box\nstove.\n\n\"It is damn strange,\" said Henri. \"I have lost seven lynx in the traps,\ntorn to pieces like they were no more than rabbits that the foxes had\nkilled. No thing--not even bear--have ever tackled lynx in a trap\nbefore. It is the first time I ever see it. And they are torn up so bad\nthey are not worth one half dollar at the post. Seven!--that is over two\nhundred dollar I have lost! There are two wolves who do it. Two--I know\nit by the tracks--always two--an'--never one. They follow my trap-line\nan' eat the rabbits I catch. They leave the fisher-cat, an' the mink,\nan' the ermine, an' the marten; but the lynx--_sacr\u00c3\u00a9_ an' damn!--they\njump on him an' pull the fur from him like you pull the wild cotton\nballs from the burn-bush! I have tried strychnine in deer fat, an' I\nhave set traps and deadfalls, but I can not catch them. They will drive\nme out unless I get them, for I have taken only five good lynx, an' they\nhave destroyed seven.\"\n\nThis roused Weyman. He was one of that growing number of thoughtful men\nwho believe that man's egoism, as a race, blinds him to many of the more\nwonderful facts of creation. He had thrown down the gantlet, and with a\nlogic that had gained him a nation-wide hearing, to those who believed\nthat man was the only living creature who could reason, and that common\nsense and cleverness when displayed by any other breathing thing were\nmerely instinct. The facts behind Henri's tale of woe struck him as\nimportant, and until midnight they talked about the two strange wolves.\n\n\"There is one big wolf an' one smaller,\" said Henri. \"An' it is always\nthe big wolf who goes in an' fights the lynx. I see that by the snow.\nWhile he's fighting, the smaller wolf makes many tracks in the snow just\nout of reach, an' then when the lynx is down, or dead, it jumps in an'\nhelps tear it into pieces. All that I know by the snow. Only once have I\nseen where the smaller one went in an' fought with the other, an' then\nthere was blood all about that was not lynx blood; I trailed the devils\na mile by the dripping.\"\n\nDuring the two weeks that followed, Weyman found much to add to the\nmaterial of his book. Not a day passed that somewhere along Henri's\ntrap-line they did not see the trails of the two wolves, and Weyman\nobserved that--as Henri had told him--the footprints were always two by\ntwo, and never one by one. On the third day they came to a trap that had\nheld a lynx, and at sight of what remained Henri cursed in both French\nand English until he was purple in the face. The lynx had been torn\nuntil its pelt was practically worthless.\n\nWeyman saw where the smaller wolf had waited on its haunches, while its\ncompanion had killed the lynx. He did not tell Henri all he thought. But\nthe days that followed convinced him more and more that he had found the\nmost dramatic exemplification of his theory. Back of this mysterious\ntragedy of the trap-line there was a _reason_.\n\nWhy did the two wolves not destroy the fisher-cat, the ermine and the\nmarten? Why was their feud with the lynx alone?\n\nWeyman was strangely thrilled. He was a lover of wild things, and for\nthat reason he never carried a gun. And when he saw Henri placing\npoison-baits for the two marauders, he shuddered, and when, day after\nday, he saw that these poison-baits were untouched, he rejoiced.\nSomething in his own nature went out in sympathy to the heroic outlaw of\nthe trap-line who never failed to give battle to the lynx. Nights in the\ncabin he wrote down his thoughts and discoveries of the day. One night\nhe turned suddenly on Henri.\n\n\"Henri, doesn't it ever make you sorry to kill so many wild things?\" he\nasked.\n\nHenri stared and shook his head.\n\n\"I kill t'ousand an' t'ousand,\" he said. \"I kill t'ousand more.\"\n\n\"And there are twenty thousand others just like you in this northern\nquarter of the continent--all killing, killing for hundreds of years\nback, and yet you can't kill out wild life. The war of Man and the\nBeast, you might call it. And, if you could return five hundred years\nfrom now, Henri, you'd still find wild life here. Nearly all the rest of\nthe world is changing, but you can't change these almost impenetrable\nthousands of square miles of ridges and swamps and forests. The\nrailroads won't come here, and I, for one, thank God for that. Take all\nthe great prairies to the west, for instance. Why, the old buffalo\ntrails are still there, plain as day--and yet, towns and cities are\ngrowing up everywhere. Did you ever hear of North Battleford?\"\n\n\"Is she near Montreal or Quebec?\" Henri asked.\n\nWeyman smiled, and drew a photograph from his pocket. It was the picture\nof a girl.\n\n\"No. It's far to the west, in Saskatchewan. Seven years ago I used to\ngo up there every year, to shoot prairie chickens, coyotes and elk.\nThere wasn't any North Battleford then--just the glorious prairie,\nhundreds and hundreds of square miles of it. There was a single shack on\nthe Saskatchewan River, where North Battleford now stands, and I used to\nstay there. In that shack there was a little girl, twelve years old. We\nused to go out hunting together--for I used to kill things in those\ndays. And the little girl would cry sometimes when I killed, and I'd\nlaugh at her.\n\n\"Then a railroad came, and then another, and they joined near the shack,\nand all at once a town sprang up. Seven years ago there was only the\nshack there, Henri. Two years ago there were eighteen hundred people.\nThis year, when I came through, there were five thousand, and two years\nfrom now there'll be ten thousand.\n\n\"On the ground where that shack stood are three banks, with a capital of\nforty million dollars; you can see the glow of the electric lights of\nthe city twenty miles away. It has a hundred-thousand dollar college, a\nhigh school, the provincial asylum, a fire department, two clubs, a\nboard of trade, and it's going to have a street-car line within two\nyears. Think of that--all where the coyotes howled a few years ago!\n\n\"People are coming in so fast that they can't keep a census. Five years\nfrom now there'll be a city of twenty thousand where the old shack\nstood. And the little girl in that shack, Henri--she's a young lady now,\nand her people are--well, rich. I don't care about that. The chief thing\nis that she is going to marry me in the spring. Because of her I stopped\nkilling things when she was only sixteen. The last thing I killed was a\nprairie wolf, and it had young. Eileen kept the little puppy. She's got\nit now--tamed. That's why above all other wild things I love the wolves.\nAnd I hope these two leave your trap-line safe.\"\n\nHenri was staring at him. Weyman gave him the picture. It was of a\nsweet-faced girl, with deep pure eyes, and there came a twitch at the\ncorners of Henri's mouth as he looked at it.\n\n\"My Iowaka died t'ree year ago,\" he said. \"She too loved the wild\nthing. But them wolf--damn! They drive me out if I can not kill them!\"\nHe put fresh fuel into the stove, and prepared for bed.\n\nOne day the big idea came to Henri.\n\nWeyman was with him when they struck fresh signs of lynx. There was a\ngreat windfall ten or fifteen feet high, and in one place the logs had\nformed a sort of cavern, with almost solid walls on three sides. The\nsnow was beaten down by tracks, and the fur of rabbit was scattered\nabout. Henri was jubilant.\n\n\"We got heem--sure!\" he said.\n\nHe built the bait-house, set a trap and looked about him shrewdly. Then\nhe explained his scheme to Weyman. If the lynx was caught, and the two\nwolves came to destroy it, the fight would take place in that shelter\nunder the windfall, and the marauders would have to pass through the\nopening. So Henri set five smaller traps, concealing them skilfully\nunder leaves and moss and snow, and all were far enough away from the\nbait-house so that the trapped lynx could not spring them in his\nstruggles.\n\n\"When they fight, wolf jump this way an' that--an' sure get in,\" said\nHenri. \"He miss one, two, t'ree--but he sure get in trap somewhere.\"\n\nThat same morning a light snow fell, making the work more complete, for\nit covered up all footprints and buried the telltale scent of man. That\nnight Kazan and Gray Wolf passed within a hundred feet of the windfall,\nand Gray Wolf's keen scent detected something strange and disquieting in\nthe air. She informed Kazan by pressing her shoulder against his, and\nthey swung off at right angles, keeping to windward of the trap-line.\n\nFor two days and three cold starlit nights nothing happened at the\nwindfall. Henri understood, and explained to Weyman. The lynx was a\nhunter, like himself, and also had its hunt-line, which it covered about\nonce a week. On the fifth night the lynx returned, went to the windfall,\nwas lured straight to the bait, and the sharp-toothed steel trap closed\nrelentlessly over its right hindfoot. Kazan and Gray Wolf were traveling\na quarter of a mile deeper in the forest when they heard the clanking of\nthe steel chain as the lynx fought; to free itself. Ten minutes later\nthey stood in the door of the windfall cavern.\n\nIt was a white clear night, so filled with brilliant stars that Henri\nhimself could have hunted by the light of them. The lynx had exhausted\nitself, and lay crouching on its belly as Kazan and Gray Wolf appeared.\nAs usual, Gray Wolf held back while Kazan began the battle. In the first\nor second of these fights on the trap-line, Kazan would probably have\nbeen disemboweled or had his jugular vein cut open, had the fierce cats\nbeen free. They were more than his match in open fight, though the\nbiggest of them fell ten pounds under his weight. Chance had saved him\non the Sun Rock. Gray Wolf and the porcupine had both added to the\ndefeat of the lynx on the sand-bar. And along Henri's hunting line it\nwas the trap that was his ally. Even with his enemy thus shackled he\ntook big chances. And he took bigger chances than ever with the lynx\nunder the windfall.\n\nThe cat was an old warrior, six or seven years old. His claws were an\ninch and a quarter long, and curved like simitars. His forefeet and his\nleft hindfoot were free, and as Kazan advanced, he drew back, so that\nthe trap-chain was slack under his body. Here Kazan could not follow his\nold tactics of circling about his trapped foe, until it had become\ntangled in the chain, or had so shortened and twisted it that there was\nno chance for a leap. He had to attack face to face, and suddenly he\nlunged in. They met shoulder to shoulder. Kazan's fangs snapped at the\nother's throat, and missed. Before he could strike again, the lynx flung\nout its free hindfoot, and even Gray Wolf heard the ripping sound that\nit made. With a snarl Kazan was flung back, his shoulder torn to the\nbone.\n\nThen it was that one of Henri's hidden traps saved him from a second\nattack--and death. Steel jaws snapped over one of his forefeet, and when\nhe leaped, the chain stopped him. Once or twice before, blind Gray Wolf\nhad leaped in, when she knew that Kazan was in great danger. For an\ninstant she forgot her caution now, and as she heard Kazan's snarl of\npain, she sprang in under the windfall. Five traps Henri had hidden in\nthe space in front of the bait-house, and Gray Wolf's feet found two of\nthese. She fell on her side, snapping and snarling. In his struggles\nKazan sprung the remaining two traps. One of them missed. The fifth, and\nlast, caught him by a hindfoot.\n\nThis was a little past midnight. From then until morning the earth and\nsnow under the windfall were torn up by the struggles of the wolf, the\ndog and the lynx to regain their freedom. And when morning came, all\nthree were exhausted, and lay on their sides, panting and with bleeding\njaws, waiting for the coming of man--and death.\n\nHenri and Weyman were out early. When they struck off the main line\ntoward the windfall, Henri pointed to the tracks of Kazan and Gray Wolf,\nand his dark face lighted up with pleasure and excitement. When they\nreached the shelter under the mass of fallen timber, both stood\nspeechless for a moment, astounded by what they saw. Even Henri had seen\nnothing like this before--two wolves and a lynx, all in traps, and\nalmost within reach of one another's fangs. But surprise could not long\ndelay the business of Henri's hunter's instinct. The wolves lay first in\nhis path, and he was raising his rifle to put a steel-capped bullet\nthrough the base of Kazan's brain, when Weyman caught him eagerly by the\narm. Weyman was staring. His fingers dug into Henri's flesh. His eyes\nhad caught a glimpse of the steel-studded collar about Kazan's neck.\n\n\"Wait!\" he cried. \"It's not a wolf. It's a dog!\"\n\nHenri lowered his rifle, staring at the collar. Weyman's eyes shot to\nGray Wolf. She was facing them, snarling, her white fangs bared to the\nfoes she could not see. Her blind eyes were closed. Where there should\nhave been eyes there was only hair, and an exclamation broke from\nWeyman's lips.\n\n\"Look!\" he commanded of Henri. \"What in the name of heaven--\"\n\n\"One is dog--wild dog that has run to the wolves,\" said Henri. \"And the\nother is--wolf.\"\n\n\"And _blind_!\" gasped Weyman.\n\n\"_Oui_, blind, m'sieur,\" added Henri, falling partly into French in his\namazement. He was raising his rifle again. Weyman seized it firmly.\n\n[Illustration: \"Wait! it's not a wolf!\"]\n\n\"Don't kill them, Henri,\" he said. \"Give them to me--alive. Figure up\nthe value of the lynx they have destroyed, and add to that the wolf\nbounty, and I will pay. Alive, they are worth to me a great deal. My\nGod, a dog--and a blind wolf--_mates_!\"\n\nHe still held Henri's rifle, and Henri was staring at him, as if he did\nnot yet quite understand.\n\nWeyman continued speaking, his eyes and face blazing.\n\n\"A dog--and a blind wolf--_mates_!\" he repeated. \"It is wonderful,\nHenri. Down there, they will say I have gone beyond _reason_, when my\nbook comes out. But I shall have proof. I shall take twenty photographs\nhere, before you kill the lynx. I shall keep the dog and the wolf alive.\nAnd I shall pay you, Henri, a hundred dollars apiece for the two. May I\nhave them?\"\n\nHenri nodded. He held his rifle in readiness, while Weyman unpacked his\ncamera and got to work. Snarling fangs greeted the click of the\ncamera-shutter--the fangs of wolf and lynx. But Kazan lay cringing, not\nthrough fear, but because he still recognized the mastery of man. And\nwhen he had finished with his pictures, Weyman approached almost within\nreach of him, and spoke even more kindly to him than the man who had\nlived back in the deserted cabin.\n\nHenri shot the lynx, and when Kazan understood this, he tore at the end\nof his trap-chains and snarled at the writhing body of his forest enemy.\nBy means of a pole and a babiche noose, Kazan was brought out from under\nthe windfall and taken to Henri's cabin. The two men then returned with\na thick sack and more babiche, and blind Gray Wolf, still fettered by\nthe traps, was made prisoner. All the rest of that day Weyman and Henri\nworked to build a stout cage of saplings, and when it was finished, the\ntwo prisoners were placed in it.\n\nBefore the dog was put in with Gray Wolf, Weyman closely examined the\nworn and tooth-marked collar about his neck.\n\nOn the brass plate he found engraved the one word, \"Kazan,\" and with a\nstrange thrill made note of it in his diary.\n\nAfter this Weyman often remained at the cabin when Henri went out on the\ntrap-line. After the second day he dared to put his hand between the\nsapling bars and touch Kazan, and the next day Kazan accepted a piece of\nraw moose meat from his hand. But at his approach, Gray Wolf would\nalways hide under the pile of balsam in the corner of their prison. The\ninstinct of generations and perhaps of centuries had taught her that man\nwas her deadliest enemy. And yet, this man did not hurt her, and Kazan\nwas not afraid of him. She was frightened at first; then puzzled, and a\ngrowing curiosity followed that. Occasionally, after the third day, she\nwould thrust her blind face out of the balsam and sniff the air when\nWeyman was at the cage, making friends with Kazan. But she would not\neat. Weyman noted that, and each day he tempted her with the choicest\nmorsels of deer and moose fat. Five days--six--seven passed, and she had\nnot taken a mouthful. Weyman could count her ribs.\n\n\"She die,\" Henri told him on the seventh night. \"She starve before she\neat in that cage. She want the forest, the wild kill, the fresh blood.\nShe two--t'ree year old--too old to make civilize.\"\n\nHenri went to bed at the usual hour, but Weyman was troubled, and sat\nup late. He wrote a long letter to the sweet-faced girl at North\nBattleford, and then he turned out the light, and painted visions of her\nin the red glow of the fire. He saw her again for that first time when\nhe camped in the little shack where the fifth city of Saskatchewan now\nstood--with her blue eyes, the big shining braid, and the fresh glow of\nthe prairies in her cheeks. She had hated him--yes, actually hated him,\nbecause he loved to kill. He laughed softly as he thought of that. She\nhad changed him--wonderfully.\n\nHe rose, opened the door, softly, and went out. Instinctively his eyes\nturned westward. The sky was a blaze of stars. In their light he could\nsee the cage, and he stood, watching and listening. A sound came to him.\nIt was Gray Wolf gnawing at the sapling bars of her prison. A moment\nlater there came a low sobbing whine, and he knew that it was Kazan\ncrying for his freedom.\n\nLeaning against the side of the cabin was an ax. Weyman seized it, and\nhis lips smiled silently. He was thrilled by a strange happiness, and a\nthousand miles away in that city on the Saskatchewan he could feel\nanother spirit rejoicing with him. He moved toward the cage. A dozen\nblows, and two of the sapling bars were knocked out. Then Weyman drew\nback. Gray Wolf found the opening first, and she slipped out into the\nstarlight like a shadow. But she did not flee. Out in the open space she\nwaited for Kazan, and for a moment the two stood there, looking at the\ncabin. Then they set off into freedom, Gray Wolf's shoulder at Kazan's\nflank.\n\nWeyman breathed deeply.\n\n\"Two by two--always two by two, until death finds one of them,\" he\nwhispered.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nTHE RED DEATH\n\n\nKazan and Gray Wolf wandered northward into the Fond du Lac country, and\nwere there when Jacques, a Hudson Bay Company's runner, came up to the\npost from the south with the first authentic news of the dread\nplague--the smallpox. For weeks there had been rumors on all sides. And\nrumor grew into rumor. From the east, the south and the west they\nmultiplied, until on all sides the Paul Reveres of the wilderness were\ncarrying word that _La Mort Rouge_--the Red Death--was at their heels,\nand the chill of a great fear swept like a shivering wind from the edge\nof civilization to the bay. Nineteen years before these same rumors had\ncome up from the south, and the Red Terror had followed. The horror of\nit still remained with the forest people, for a thousand unmarked\ngraves, shunned like a pestilence, and scattered from the lower waters\nof James Bay to the lake country of the Athabasca, gave evidence of the\ntoll it demanded.\n\nNow and then in their wanderings Kazan and Gray Wolf had come upon the\nlittle mounds that covered the dead. Instinct--something that was\ninfinitely beyond the comprehension of man--made them _feel_ the\npresence of death about them, perhaps smell it in the air. Gray Wolf's\nwild blood and her blindness gave her an immense advantage over Kazan\nwhen it came to detecting those mysteries of the air and the earth which\nthe eyes were not made to see. Each day that had followed that terrible\nmoonlit night on the Sun Rock, when the lynx had blinded her, had added\nto the infallibility of her two chief senses--hearing and scent. And it\nwas she who discovered the presence of the plague first, just as she had\nscented the great forest fire hours before Kazan had found it in the\nair.\n\nKazan had lured her back to a trap-line. The trail they found was old.\nIt had not been traveled for many days. In a trap they found a rabbit,\nbut it had been dead a long time. In another there was the carcass of a\nfox, torn into bits by the owls. Most of the traps were sprung. Others\nwere covered with snow. Kazan, with his three-quarters strain of dog,\nran over the trail from trap to trap, intent only on something\nalive--meat to devour. Gray Wolf, in her blindness, scented _death_. It\nshivered in the tree-tops above her. She found it in every trap-house\nthey came to--death--_man death_. It grew stronger and stronger, and\nshe whined, and nipped Kazan's flank. And Kazan went on. Gray Wolf\nfollowed him to the edge of the clearing in which Loti's cabin stood,\nand then she sat back on her haunches, raised her blind face to the gray\nsky, and gave a long and wailing cry. In that moment the bristles began\nto stand up along Kazan's spine. Once, long ago, he had howled before\nthe tepee of a master who was newly dead, and he settled back on his\nhaunches, and gave the death-cry with Gray Wolf. He, too, scented it\nnow. Death was in the cabin, and over the cabin there stood a sapling\npole, and at the end of the pole there fluttered a strip of red cotton\nrag--the warning flag of the plague from Athabasca to the bay. This man,\nlike a hundred other heroes of the North, had run up the warning before\nhe laid himself down to die. And that same night, in the cold light of\nthe moon, Kazan and Gray Wolf swung northward into the country of the\nFond du Lac.\n\nThere preceded them a messenger from the post on Reindeer Lake, who was\npassing up the warning that had come from Nelson House and the country\nto the southeast.\n\n\"There's smallpox on the Nelson,\" the messenger informed Williams, at\nFond du Lac, \"and it has struck the Crees on Wollaston Lake. God only\nknows what it is doing to the Bay Indians, but we hear it is wiping out\nthe Chippewas between the Albany and the Churchill.\" He left the same\nday with his winded dogs. \"I'm off to carry word to the Reveillon people\nto the west,\" he explained.\n\nThree days later, word came from Churchill that all of the company's\nservants and his majesty's subjects west of the bay should prepare\nthemselves for the coming of the Red Terror. Williams' thin face turned\nas white as the paper he held, as he read the words of the Churchill\nfactor.\n\n\"It means dig graves,\" he said. \"That's the only preparation we can\nmake.\"\n\nHe read the paper aloud to the men at Fond du Lac, and every available\nman was detailed to spread the warning throughout the post's territory.\nThere was a quick harnessing of dogs, and on each sledge that went out\nwas a roll of red cotton cloth--rolls that were ominous of death, lurid\nsignals of pestilence and horror, whose touch sent shuddering chills\nthrough the men who were about to scatter them among the forest people.\nKazan and Gray Wolf struck the trail of one of these sledges on the Gray\nBeaver, and followed it for half a mile. The next day, farther to the\nwest, they struck another, and on the fourth day still a third. The last\ntrail was fresh, and Gray Wolf drew back from it as if stung, her fangs\nsnarling. On the wind there came to them the pungent odor of smoke. They\ncut at right angles to the trail, Gray Wolf leaping clear of the marks\nin the snow, and climbed to the cap of a ridge. To windward of them, and\ndown in the plain, a cabin was burning. A team of huskies and a man were\ndisappearing in the spruce forest. Deep down in his throat Kazan gave a\nrumbling whine. Gray Wolf stood as rigid as a rock. In the cabin a\nplague-dead man was burning. It was the law of the North. And the\nmystery of the funeral pyre came again to Kazan and Gray Wolf. This time\nthey did not howl, but slunk down into the farther plain, and did not\nstop that day until they had buried themselves deep in a dry and\nsheltered swamp ten miles to the north.\n\nAfter this they followed the days and weeks which marked the winter of\nnineteen hundred and ten as one of the most terrible in all the history\nof the Northland--a single month in which wild life as well as human\nhung in the balance, and when cold, starvation and plague wrote a\nchapter in the lives of the forest people which will not be forgotten\nfor generations to come.\n\nIn the swamp Kazan and Gray Wolf found a home under a windfall. It was a\nsmall comfortable nest, shut in entirely from the snow and wind. Gray\nWolf took possession of it immediately. She flattened herself out on her\nbelly, and panted to show Kazan her contentment and satisfaction. Nature\nagain kept Kazan close at her side. A vision came to him, unreal and\ndream-like, of that wonderful night under the stars--ages and ages ago,\nit seemed--when he had fought the leader of the wolf-pack, and young\nGray Wolf had crept to his side after his victory and had given herself\nto him for mate. But this mating season there was no running after the\ndoe or the caribou, or mingling with the wild pack. They lived chiefly\non rabbit and spruce partridge, because of Gray Wolf's blindness. Kazan\ncould hunt those alone. The hair had now grown over Gray Wolf's\nsightless eyes. She had ceased to grieve, to rub her eyes with her paws,\nto whine for the sunlight, the golden moon and the stars. Slowly she\nbegan to forget that she had ever seen those things. She could now run\nmore swiftly at Kazan's flank. Scent and hearing had become wonderfully\nkeen. She could wind a caribou two miles distant, and the presence of\nman she could pick up at an even greater distance. On a still night she\nhad heard the splash of a trout half a mile away. And as these two\nthings--scent and hearing--became more and more developed in her, those\nsame senses became less active in Kazan.\n\nHe began to depend upon Gray Wolf. She would point out the hiding-place\nof a partridge fifty yards from their trail. In their hunts she became\nthe leader--until game was found. And as Kazan learned to trust to her\nin the hunt, so he began just as instinctively to heed her warnings. If\nGray Wolf reasoned, it was to the effect that without Kazan she would\ndie. She had tried hard now and then to catch a partridge, or a rabbit,\nbut she had always failed. Kazan meant life to her. And--if she\nreasoned--it was to make herself indispensable to her mate. Blindness\nhad made her different than she would otherwise have been. Again nature\npromised motherhood to her. But she did not--as she would have done in\nthe open, and with sight--hold more and more aloof from Kazan as the\ndays passed. It was her habit, spring, summer and winter, to snuggle\nclose to Kazan and lie with her beautiful head resting on his neck or\nback. If Kazan snarled at her she did not snap back, but slunk down as\nthough struck a blow. With her warm tongue she would lick away the ice\nthat froze to the long hair between Kazan's toes. For days after he had\nrun a sliver in his paw she nursed his foot. Blindness had made Kazan\nabsolutely necessary to her existence--and now, in a different way, she\nbecame more and more necessary to Kazan. They were happy in their swamp\nhome. There was plenty of small game about them, and it was warm under\nthe windfall. Rarely did they go beyond the limits of the swamp to hunt.\nOut on the more distant plains and the barren ridges they occasionally\nheard the cry of the wolf-pack on the trail of meat, but it no longer\nthrilled them with a desire to join in the chase.\n\nOne day they struck farther than usual to the west. They left the swamp,\ncrossed a plain over which a fire had swept the preceding year, climbed\na ridge, and descended into a second plain. At the bottom Gray Wolf\nstopped and sniffed the air. At these times Kazan always watched her,\nwaiting eagerly and nervously if the scent was too faint for him to\ncatch. But to-day he caught the edge of it, and he knew why Gray Wolf's\nears flattened, and her hindquarters drooped. The scent of game would\nhave made her rigid and alert. But it was not the game smell. It was\nhuman, and Gray Wolf slunk behind Kazan and whined. For several minutes\nthey stood without moving or making a sound, and then Kazan led the way\non. Less than three hundred yards away they came to a thick clump of\nscrub spruce, and almost ran into a snow-smothered tepee. It was\nabandoned. Life and fire had not been there for a long time. But from\nthe tepee had come the man-smell. With legs rigid and his spine\nquivering Kazan approached the opening to the tepee. He looked in. In\nthe middle of the tepee, lying on the charred embers of a fire, lay a\nragged blanket--and in the blanket was wrapped the body of a little\nIndian child. Kazan could see the tiny moccasined feet. But so long had\ndeath been there that he could scarcely smell the presence of it. He\ndrew back, and saw Gray Wolf cautiously nosing about a long and\npeculiarly shaped hummock in the snow. She had traveled about it three\ntimes, but never approaching nearer than a man could have reached with a\nrifle barrel. At the end of her third circle she sat down on her\nhaunches, and Kazan went close to the hummock and sniffed. Under that\nbulge in the snow, as well as in the tepee, there was death. They slunk\naway, their ears flattened and their tails drooping until they trailed\nthe snow, and did not stop until they reached their swamp home. Even\nthere Gray Wolf still sniffed the horror of the plague, and her muscles\ntwitched and shivered as she lay close at Kazan's side.\n\nThat night the big white moon had around its edge a crimson rim. It\nmeant cold--intense cold. Always the plague came in the days of greatest\ncold--the lower the temperature the more terrible its havoc. It grew\nsteadily colder that night, and the increased chill penetrated to the\nheart of the windfall, and drew Kazan and Gray Wolf closer together.\nWith dawn, which came at about eight o'clock, Kazan and his blind mate\nsallied forth into the day. It was fifty degrees below zero. About them\nthe trees cracked with reports like pistol-shots. In the thickest spruce\nthe partridges were humped into round balls of feathers. The snow-shoe\nrabbits had burrowed deep under the snow or to the heart of the heaviest\nwindfalls. Kazan and Gray Wolf found few fresh trails, and after an\nhour of fruitless hunting they returned to their lair. Kazan, dog-like,\nhad buried the half of a rabbit two or three days before, and they dug\nthis out of the snow and ate the frozen flesh.\n\nAll that day it grew colder--steadily colder. The night that followed\nwas cloudless, with a white moon and brilliant stars. The temperature\nhad fallen another ten degrees, and nothing was moving. Traps were never\nsprung on such nights, for even the furred things--the mink, and the\nermine, and the lynx--lay snug in the holes and the nests they had found\nfor themselves. An increasing hunger was not strong enough to drive\nKazan and Gray Wolf from their windfall. The next day there was no break\nin the terrible cold, and toward noon Kazan set out on a hunt for meat,\nleaving Gray Wolf in the windfall. Being three-quarters dog, food was\nmore necessary to Kazan than to his mate. Nature has fitted the\nwolf-breed for famine, and in ordinary temperature Gray Wolf could have\nlived for a fortnight without food. At sixty degrees below zero she\ncould exist a week, perhaps ten days. Only thirty hours had passed\nsinee they had devoured the last of the frozen rabbit, and she was quite\nsatisfied to remain in their snug retreat.\n\nBut Kazan was hungry. He began to hunt in the face of the wind,\ntraveling toward the burned plain. He nosed about every windfall that he\ncame to, and investigated the thickets. A thin shot-like snow had\nfallen, and in this--from the windfall to the burn--he found but a\nsingle trail, and that was the trail of an ermine. Under a windfall he\ncaught the warm scent of a rabbit, but the rabbit was as safe from him\nthere as were the partridges in the trees, and after an hour of futile\ndigging and gnawing he gave up his effort to reach it. For three hours\nhe had hunted when he returned to Gray Wolf. He was exhausted. While\nGray Wolf, with the instinct of the wild, had saved her own strength and\nenergy, Kazan had been burning up his reserve forces, and was hungrier\nthan ever.\n\nThe moon rose clear and brilliant in the sky again that night, and Kazan\nset out once more on the hunt. He urged Gray Wolf to accompany him,\nwhining for her outside the windfall--returning for her twice--but\nGray Wolf laid her ears aslant and refused to move. The temperature had\nnow fallen to sixty-five or seventy degrees below zero, and with it\nthere came from the north an increasing wind, making the night one in\nwhich human life could not have existed for an hour. By midnight Kazan\nwas back under the windfall. The wind grew stronger. It began to wail in\nmournful dirges over the swamp, and then it burst in fierce shrieking\nvolleys, with intervals of quiet between. These were the first warnings\nfrom the great barrens that lay between the last lines of timber and the\nArctic. With morning the storm burst in all its fury from out of the\nnorth, and Gray Wolf and Kazan lay close together and shivered as they\nlistened to the roar of it over the windfall. Once Kazan thrust his head\nand shoulders out from the shelter of the fallen trees, but the storm\ndrove him back. Everything that possessed life had sought shelter,\naccording to its way and instinct. The furred creatures like the mink\nand the ermine were safest, for during the warmer hunting days they were\nof the kind that cached meat. The wolves and the foxes had sought out\nthe windfalls, and the rocks. Winged things, with the exception of the\nowls, who were a tenth part body and nine-tenths feathers, burrowed\nunder snow-drifts or found shelter in thick spruce. To the hoofed and\nhorned animals the storm meant greatest havoc. The deer, the caribou and\nthe moose could not crawl under windfalls or creep between rocks. The\nbest they could do was to lie down in the lee of a drift, and allow\nthemselves to be covered deep with the protecting snow. Even then they\ncould not keep their shelter long, for they had to _eat_. For eighteen\nhours out of the twenty-four the moose had to feed to keep himself alive\nduring the winter. His big stomach demanded quantity, and it took him\nmost of his time to nibble from the tops of bushes the two or three\nbushels he needed a day. The caribou required almost as much--the deer\nleast of the three.\n\nAnd the storm kept up that day, and the next, and still a third--three\ndays and three nights--and the third day and night there came with it a\nstinging, shot-like snow that fell two feet deep on the level, and in\ndrifts of eight and ten. It was the \"heavy snow\" of the Indians--the\nsnow that lay like lead on the earth, and under which partridges and\nrabbits were smothered in thousands.\n\nOn the fourth day after the beginning of the storm Kazan and Gray Wolf\nissued forth from the windfall. There was no longer a wind--no more\nfalling snow. The whole world lay under a blanket of unbroken white, and\nit was intensely cold.\n\nThe plague had worked its havoc with men. Now had come the days of\nfamine and death for the wild things.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nTHE TRAIL OF HUNGER\n\n\nKazan and Gray Wolf had been a hundred and forty hours without food. To\nGray Wolf this meant acute discomfort, a growing weakness. To Kazan it\nwas starvation. Six days and six nights of fasting had drawn in their\nribs and put deep hollows in front of their hindquarters. Kazan's eyes\nwere red, and they narrowed to slits as he looked forth into the day.\nGray Wolf followed him this time when he went out on the hard snow.\nEagerly and hopefully they began the hunt in the bitter cold. They swung\naround the edge of the windfall, where there had always been rabbits.\nThere were no tracks now, and no scent. They continued in a horseshoe\ncircle through the swamp, and the only scent they caught was that of a\nsnow-owl perched up in a spruce. They came to the burn and turned back,\nhunting the opposite side of the swamp. On this side there was a ridge.\nThey climbed the ridge, and from the cap of it looked out over a world\nthat was barren of life. Ceaselessly Gray Wolf sniffed the air, but she\ngave no signal to Kazan. On the top of the ridge Kazan stood panting.\nHis endurance was gone. On their return through the swamp he stumbled\nover an obstacle which he tried to clear with a jump. Hungrier and\nweaker, they returned to the windfall. The night that followed was\nclear, and brilliant with stars. They hunted the swamp again. Nothing\nwas moving--save one other creature, and that was a fox. Instinct told\nthem that it was futile to follow him.\n\nIt was then that the old thought of the cabin returned to Kazan. Two\nthings the cabin had always meant to him--warmth and food. And far\nbeyond the ridge was the cabin, where he and Gray Wolf had howled at the\nscent of death. He did not think of man--or of that mystery which he had\nhowled at. He thought only of the cabin, and the cabin had always meant\nfood. He set off in a straight line for the ridge, and Gray Wolf\nfollowed. They crossed the ridge and the burn beyond, and entered the\nedge of a second swamp. Kazan was hunting listlessly now. His head hung\nlow. His bushy tail dragged in the snow. He was intent on the\ncabin--only the cabin. It was his last hope. But Gray Wolf was still\nalert, taking in the wind, and lifting her head whenever Kazan stopped\nto snuffle his chilled nose in the snow. At last it came--the scent!\nKazan had moved on, but he stopped when he found that Gray Wolf was not\nfollowing. All the strength that was in his starved body revealed itself\nin a sudden rigid tenseness as he looked at his mate. Her forefeet were\nplanted firmly to the east; her slim gray head was reaching out for the\nscent; her body trembled.\n\nThen--suddenly--they heard a sound, and with a whining cry Kazan set out\nin its direction, with Gray Wolf at his flank. The scent grew stronger\nand stronger in Gray Wolf's nostrils, and soon it came to Kazan. It was\nnot the scent of a rabbit or a partridge. It was big game. They\napproached cautiously, keeping full in the wind. The swamp grew\nthicker, the spruce more dense, and now--from a hundred yards ahead of\nthem--there came a crashing of locked and battling horns. Ten seconds\nmore they climbed over a snowdrift, and Kazan stopped and dropped flat\non his belly. Gray Wolf crouched close at his side, her blind eyes\nturned to what she could smell but could not see.\n\nFifty yards from them a number of moose had gathered for shelter in the\nthick spruce. They had eaten clear a space an acre in extent. The trees\nwere cropped bare as high as they could reach, and the snow was beaten\nhard under their feet. There were six animals in the acre, two of them\nbulls--and these bulls were fighting, while three cows and a yearling\nwere huddled in a group watching the mighty duel. Just before the storm\na young bull, sleek, three-quarters grown, and with the small compact\nantlers of a four-year-old, had led the three cows and the yearling to\nthis sheltered spot among the spruce. Until last night he had been\nmaster of the herd. During the night the older bull had invaded his\ndominion. The invader was four times as old as the young bull. He was\nhalf again as heavy. His huge palmate horns, knotted and irregular--but\nmassive--spoke of age. A warrior of a hundred fights, he had not\nhesitated to give battle in his effort to rob the younger bull of his\nhome and family. Three times they had fought since dawn, and the\nhard-trodden snow was red with blood. The smell of it came to Kazan's\nand Gray Wolf's nostrils. Kazan sniffed hungrily. Queer sounds rolled up\nand down in Gray Wolf's throat, and she licked her jaws.\n\nFor a moment the two fighters drew a few yards apart, and stood with\nlowered heads. The old bull had not yet won victory. The younger bull\nrepresented youth and endurance; in the older bull those things were\npitted against craft, greater weight, maturer strength--and a head and\nhorns that were like a battering ram. But in that great hulk of the\nolder bull there was one other thing--age. His huge sides were panting.\nHis nostrils were as wide as bells. Then, as if some invisible spirit of\nthe arena had given the signal, the animals came together again. The\ncrash of their horns could have been heard half a mile away, and under\ntwelve hundred pounds of flesh and bone the younger hull went plunging\nback upon his haunches. Then was when youth displayed itself. In an\ninstant he was up, and locking horns with his adversary. Twenty times he\nhad done this, and each attack had seemed filled with increasing\nstrength. And now, as if realizing that the last moments of the last\nfight had come, he twisted the old bull's neck and fought as he had\nnever fought before. Kazan and Gray Wolf both heard the sharp crack that\nfollowed--as if a dry stick had been stepped upon and broken. It was\nFebruary, and the hoofed animals were already beginning to shed their\nhorns--especially the older bulls, whose palmate growths drop first.\nThis fact gave victory to the younger bull in the blood-stained arena a\nfew yards from Gray Wolf and Kazan. From its socket in the old bull's\nskull one of his huge antlers broke with that sharp snapping sound, and\nin another moment four inches of stiletto-like horn buried itself back\nof his foreleg. In an instant all hope and courage left him, and he\nswung backward yard by yard, with the younger bull prodding his neck and\nshoulders until blood dripped from him in little streams. At the edge\nof the clearing he flung himself free and crashed off into the forest.\n\nThe younger bull did not pursue. He tossed his head, and stood for a few\nmoments with heaving sides and dilated nostrils, facing in the direction\nhis vanquished foe had taken. Then he turned, and trotted back to the\nstill motionless cows and yearling.\n\nKazan and Gray Wolf were quivering. Gray Wolf slunk back from the edge\nof the clearing, and Kazan followed. No longer were they interested in\nthe cows and the young bull. From that clearing they had seen meat\ndriven forth--meat that was beaten in fight, and bleeding. Every\ninstinct of the wild pack returned to Gray Wolf now--and in Kazan the\nmad desire to taste the blood he smelled. Swiftly they turned toward the\nblood-stained trail of the old bull, and when they came to it they found\nit spattered red. Kazan's jaws dripped as the hot scent drove the blood\nlike veins of fire through his weakened body. His eyes were reddened by\nstarvation, and in them there was a light now that they had never known\neven in the days of the wolf-pack.\n\nHe set off swiftly, almost forgetful of Gray Wolf. But his mate no\nlonger required his flank for guidance. With her nose close to the trail\nshe ran--ran as she had run in the long and thrilling hunts before\nblindness came. Half a mile from the spruce thicket they came upon the\nold bull. He had sought shelter behind a clump of balsam, and he stood\nover a growing pool of blood in the snow. He was still breathing hard.\nHis massive head, grotesque now with its one antler, was drooping.\nFlecks of blood dropped from his distended nostrils. Even then, with the\nold bull weakened by starvation, exhaustion and loss of blood, a\nwolf-pack would have hung back before attacking. Where they would have\nhesitated, Kazan leaped in with a snarling cry. For an instant his fangs\nsunk into the thick hide of the bull's throat. Then he was flung\nback--twenty feet. Hunger gnawing at his vitals robbed him of all\ncaution, and he sprang to the attack again--full at the bull's\nfront--while Gray Wolf crept up unseen behind, seeking in her blindness\nthe vulnerable part which nature had not taught Kazan to find.\n\nThis time Kazan was caught fairly on the broad palmate leaf of the\nbull's antler, and he was flung back again, half stunned. In that same\nmoment Gray Wolf's long white teeth cut like knives through one of the\nbull's rope-like hamstrings. For thirty seconds she kept the hold, while\nthe bull plunged wildly in his efforts to trample her underfoot. Kazan\nwas quick to learn, still quicker to be guided by Gray Wolf, and he\nleaped in again, snapping for a hold on the bulging cord just above the\nknee. He missed, and as he lunged forward on his shoulders Gray Wolf was\nflung off. But she had accomplished her purpose. Beaten in open battle\nwith one of his kind, and now attacked by a still deadlier foe, the old\nbull began to retreat. As he went, one hip sank under him at every step.\nThe tendon of his left leg was bitten half through.\n\nWithout being able to see, Gray Wolf seemed to realize what had\nhappened. Again she was the pack-wolf--with all the old wolf strategy.\nTwice flung back by the old bull's horn, Kazan knew better than to\nattack openly again. Gray Wolf trotted after the bull, but he remained\nbehind for a moment to lick up hungrily mouthfuls of the blood-soaked\nsnow. Then he followed, and ran close against Gray Wolf's side, fifty\nyards behind the bull. There was more blood in the trail now--a thin red\nribbon of it. Fifteen minutes later the bull stopped again, and faced\nabout, his great head lowered. His eyes were red. There was a droop to\nhis neck and shoulders that spoke no longer of the unconquerable\nfighting spirit that had been a part of him for nearly a score of years.\nNo longer was he lord of the wilderness about him; no longer was there\ndefiance in the poise of his splendid head, or the flash of eager fire\nin his bloodshot eyes. His breath came with a gasping sound that was\ngrowing more and more distinct. A hunter would have known what it meant.\nThe stiletto-point of the younger bull's antler had gone home, and the\nold bull's lungs were failing him. More than once Gray Wolf had heard\nthat sound in the early days of her hunting with the pack, and she\nunderstood. Slowly she began to circle about the wounded monarch at a\ndistance of about twenty yards. Kazan kept at her side.\n\nOnce--twice--twenty times they made that slow circle, and with each turn\nthey made the old bull turned, and his breath grew heavier and his head\ndrooped lower. Noon came, and was followed by the more intense cold of\nthe last half of the day. Twenty circles became a hundred--two\nhundred--and more. Under Gray Wolf's and Kazan's feet the snow grew hard\nin the path they made. Under the old bull's widespread hoofs the snow\nwas no longer white--but red. A thousand times before this unseen\ntragedy of the wilderness had been enacted. It was an epoch of that life\nwhere life itself means the survival of the fittest, where to live means\nto kill, and to die means to perpetuate life. At last, in that steady\nand deadly circling of Gray Wolf and Kazan, there came a time when the\nold bull did not turn--then a second, a third and a fourth time, and\nGray Wolf seemed to know. With Kazan she drew back from the hard-beaten\ntrail, and they flattened themselves on their bellies under a dwarf\nspruce--and waited. For many minutes the bull stood motionless, his\nhamstrung quarter sinking lower and lower. And then with a deep\nblood-choked gasp he sank down.\n\nFor a long time Kazan and Gray Wolf did not move, and when at last they\nreturned to the beaten trail the bull's heavy head was resting on the\nsnow. Again they began to circle, and now the circle narrowed foot by\nfoot, until only ten yards--then nine--then eight--separated them from\ntheir prey. The bull attempted to rise, and failed. Gray Wolf heard the\neffort. She heard him sink back and suddenly she leaped in swiftly and\nsilently from behind. Her sharp fangs buried themselves in the bull's\nnostrils, and with the first instinct of the husky, Kazan sprang for a\nthroat hold. This time he was not flung off. It was Gray Wolf's terrible\nhold that gave him time to tear through the half-inch hide, and to bury\nhis teeth deeper and deeper, until at last they reached the jugular. A\ngush of warm blood spurted into his face. But he did not let go. Just as\nhe had held to the jugular of his first buck on that moonlight night a\nlong time ago, so he held to the old bull now. It was Gray Wolf who\nunclamped his jaws. She drew back, sniffing the air, listening. Then,\nslowly, she raised her head, and through the frozen and starving\nwilderness there went her wailing triumphant cry--the call to meat.\n\nFor them the days of famine had passed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nTHE RIGHT OF FANG\n\n\nAfter the fight Kazan lay down exhausted in the blood-stained snow,\nwhile faithful Gray Wolf, still filled with the endurance of her wild\nwolf breed, tore fiercely at the thick skin on the bull's neck to lay\nopen the red flesh. When she had done this she did not eat, but ran to\nKazan's side and whined softly as she muzzled him with her nose. After\nthat they feasted, crouching side by side at the bull's neck and tearing\nat the warm sweet flesh.\n\nThe last pale light of the northern day was fading swiftly into night\nwhen they drew back, gorged until there were no longer hollows in their\nsides. The faint wind died away. The clouds that had hung in the sky\nduring the day drifted eastward, and the moon shone brilliant and clear.\nFor an hour the night continued to grow lighter. To the brilliance of\nthe moon and the stars there was added now the pale fires of the aurora\nborealis, shivering and flashing over the Pole.\n\nIts hissing crackling monotone, like the creaking of steel\nsledge-runners on frost-filled snow, came faintly to the ears of Kazan\nand Gray Wolf.\n\nAs yet they had not gone a hundred yards from the dead bull, and at the\nfirst sound of that strange mystery in the northern skies they stopped\nand listened to it, alert and suspicious. Then they laid their ears\naslant and trotted slowly back to the meat they had killed. Instinct\ntold them that it was theirs only by right of fang. They had fought to\nkill it. And it was in the law of the wild that they would have to fight\nto keep it. In good hunting days they would have gone on and wandered\nunder the moon and the stars. But long days and nights of starvation had\ntaught them something different now.\n\nOn that clear and stormless night following the days of plague and\nfamine, a hundred thousand hungry creatures came out from their retreats\nto hunt for food. For eighteen hundred miles east and west and a\nthousand miles north and south, slim gaunt-bellied creatures hunted\nunder the moon and the stars. Something told Kazan and Gray Wolf that\nthis hunt was on, and never for an instant did they cease their\nvigilance. At last they lay down at the edge of the spruce thicket, and\nwaited. Gray Wolf muzzled Kazan gently with her blind face. The uneasy\nwhine in her throat was a warning to him. Then she sniffed the air, and\nlistened--sniffed and listened.\n\nSuddenly every muscle in their bodies grew rigid. Something living had\npassed near them, something that they could not see or hear, and\nscarcely scent. It came again, as mysterious as a shadow, and then out\nof the air there floated down as silently as a huge snowflake a great\nwhite owl. Kazan saw the hungry winged creature settle on the bull's\nshoulder. Like a flash he was out from his cover, Gray Wolf a yard\nbehind him. With an angry snarl he lunged at the white robber, and his\njaws snapped on empty air. His leap carried him clean over the bull. He\nturned, but the owl was gone.\n\nNearly all of his old strength had returned to him now. He trotted about\nthe bull, the hair along his spine bristling like a brush, his eyes\nwide and menacing. He snarled at the still air. His jaws clicked, and he\nsat back on his haunches and faced the blood-stained trail that the\nmoose had left before he died. Again that instinct as infallible as\nreason told him that danger would come from there.\n\nLike a red ribbon the trail ran back through the wilderness. The little\nswift-moving ermine were everywhere this night, looking like white rats\nas they dodged about in the moonlight. They were first to find the\ntrail, and with all the ferocity of their blood-eating nature followed\nit with quick exciting leaps. A fox caught the scent of it a quarter of\na mile to windward, and came nearer. From out of a deep windfall a\nbeady-eyed, thin-bellied fisher-cat came forth, and stopped with his\nfeet in the crimson ribbon.\n\nIt was the fisher-cat that brought Kazan out; from under his cover of\nspruce again. In the moonlight there was a sharp quick fight, a snarling\nand scratching, a cat-like yowl of pain, and the fisher forgot his\nhunger in flight. Kazan returned to Gray Wolf with a lacerated and\nbleeding nose. Gray Wolf licked it sympathetically, while Kazan stood\nrigid and listening.\n\nThe fox swung swiftly away with the wind, warned by the sounds of\nconflict. He was not a fighter, but a murderer who killed from behind,\nand a little later he leaped upon an owl and tore it into bits for the\nhalf-pound of flesh within the mass of feathers.\n\nBut nothing could drive back those little white outlaws of the\nwilderness--the ermine. They would have stolen between the feet of man\nto get at the warm flesh and blood of the freshly killed bull. Kazan\nhunted them savagely. They were too quick for him, more like elusive\nflashes in the moonlight than things of life. They burrowed under the\nold bull's body and fed while he raved and filled his mouth with snow.\nGray Wolf sat placidly on her haunches. The little ermine did not\ntrouble her, and after a time Kazan realized this, and flung himself\ndown beside her, panting and exhausted.\n\nFor a long time after that the night was almost unbroken by sound. Once\nin the far distance there came the cry of a wolf, and now and then, to\npunctuate the deathly silence, the snow owl hooted in blood-curdling\nprotest from his home in the spruce-tops. The moon was straight above\nthe old bull when Gray Wolf scented the first real danger. Instantly she\ngave the warning to Kazan and faced the bloody trail, her lithe body\nquivering, her fangs gleaming in the starlight, a snarling whine in her\nthroat. Only in the face of their deadliest enemy, the lynx--the\nterrible fighter who had blinded her long ago in that battle on the Sun\nRock!--did she give such warning as this to Kazan. He sprang ahead of\nher, ready for battle even before he caught the scent of the gray\nbeautiful creature of death stealing over the trail.\n\nThen came the interruption. From a mile away there burst forth a single\nfierce long-drawn howl.\n\nAfter all, that was the cry of the true master of the wilderness--the\nwolf. It was the cry of hunger. It was the cry that sent men's blood\nrunning more swiftly through their veins, that brought the moose and the\ndeer to their feet shivering in every limb--the cry that wailed like a\nnote of death through swamp and forest and over the snow-smothered\nridges until its faintest echoes reached for miles into the starlit\nnight.\n\nThere was silence, and in that awesome stillness Kazan and Gray Wolf\nstood shoulder to shoulder facing the cry, and in response to that cry\nthere worked within them a strange and mystic change, for what they had\nheard was not a warning or a menace but the call of Brotherhood. Away\noff there--beyond the lynx and the fox and the fisher-cat, were the\ncreatures of their kind, the wild-wolf pack, to which the right to all\nflesh and blood was common--in which existed that savage socialism of\nthe wilderness, the Brotherhood of the Wolf. And Gray Wolf, setting back\non her haunches, sent forth the response to that cry--a wailing\ntriumphant note that told her hungry brethren there was feasting at the\nend of the trail.\n\nAnd the lynx, between those two cries, sneaked off into the wide and\nmoonlit spaces of the forest.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nA FIGHT UNDER THE STARS\n\n\nOn their haunches Kazan and Gray Wolf waited. Five minutes passed,\nten--fifteen--and Gray Wolf became uneasy. No response had followed her\ncall. Again she howled, with Kazan quivering and listening beside her,\nand again there followed that dead stillness of the night. This was not\nthe way of the pack. She knew that it had not gone beyond the reach of\nher voice and its silence puzzled her. And then in a flash it came to\nthem both that the pack, or the single wolf whose cry they had heard,\nwas very near them. The scent was warm. A few moments later Kazan saw a\nmoving object in the moonlight. It was followed by another, and still\nanother, until there were five slouching in a half-circle about them,\nseventy yards away. Then they laid themselves flat in the snow and were\nmotionless.\n\nA snarl turned Kazan's eyes to Gray Wolf. His blind mate had drawn\nback. Her white fangs gleamed menacingly in the starlight. Her ears were\nflat. Kazan was puzzled. Why was she signaling danger to him when it was\nthe wolf, and not the lynx, out there in the snow? And why did the\nwolves not come in and feast? Slowly he moved toward them, and Gray Wolf\ncalled to him with her whine. He paid no attention to her, but went on,\nstepping lightly, his head high in the air, his spine bristling.\n\nIn the scent of the strangers, Kazan was catching something now that was\nstrangely familiar. It drew him toward them more swiftly and when at\nlast he stopped twenty yards from where the little group lay flattened\nin the snow, his thick brush waved slightly. One of the animals sprang\nup and approached. The others followed and in another moment Kazan was\nin the midst of them, smelling and smelled, and wagging his tail. They\nwere dogs, and not wolves.\n\nIn some lonely cabin in the wilderness their master had died, and they\nhad taken to the forests. They still bore signs of the sledge-traces.\nAbout their necks were moose-hide collars. The hair was worn short at\ntheir flanks, and one still dragged after him three feet of corded\nbabiche trace. Their eyes gleamed red and hungry in the glow of the moon\nand the stars. They were thin, and gaunt and starved, and Kazan suddenly\nturned and trotted ahead of them to the side of the dead bull. Then he\nfell back and sat proudly on his haunches beside Gray Wolf, listening to\nthe snapping of jaws and the rending of flesh as the starved pack\nfeasted.\n\nGray Wolf slunk closer to Kazan. She muzzled his neck and Kazan gave her\na swift dog-like caress of his tongue, assuring her that all was well.\nShe flattened herself in the snow when the dogs had finished and came up\nin their dog way to sniff at her, and make closer acquaintance with\nKazan. Kazan towered over her, guarding her. One huge red-eyed dog who\nstill dragged the bit of babiche trace muzzled Gray Wolf's soft neck for\na fraction of a second too long, and Kazan uttered a savage snarl of\nwarning. The dog drew back, and for a moment their fangs gleamed over\nGray Wolf's blind face. It was the Challenge of the Breed.\n\nThe big husky was the leader of the pack, and if one of the other dogs\nhad snarled at him, as Kazan snarled he would have leaped at his throat.\nBut in Kazan, standing fierce and half wild over Gray Wolf, he\nrecognized none of the serfdom of the sledge-dogs. It was master facing\nmaster; in Kazan it was more than that for he was Gray Wolf's mate. In\nan instant more he would have leaped over her body to have fought for\nher, more than for the right of leadership. But the big husky turned\naway sullenly, growling, still snarling, and vented his rage by nipping\nfiercely at the flank of one of his sledge-mates.\n\nGray Wolf understood what had happened, though she could not see. She\nshrank closer to Kazan. She knew that the moon and the stars had looked\ndown on that thing that always meant death--the challenge to the right\nof mate. With her luring coyness, whining and softly muzzling his\nshoulder and neck, she tried to draw Kazan away from the pad-beaten\ncircle in which the bull lay. Kazan's answer was an ominous rolling of\nsmothered thunder deep down in his throat. He lay down beside her,\nlicked her blind face swiftly, and faced the stranger dogs.\n\nThe moon sank lower and lower and at last dropped behind the western\nforests. The stars grew paler. One by one they faded from the sky and\nafter a time there followed the cold gray dawn of the North. In that\ndawn the big husky leader rose from the hole he had made in the snow and\nreturned to the bull. Kazan, alert, was on his feet in an instant and\nstood also close to the bull. The two circled ominously, their heads\nlowered, their crests bristling. The husky drew away, and Kazan crouched\nat the bull's neck and began tearing at the frozen flesh. He was not\nhungry. But in this way he showed his right to the flesh, his defiance\nof the right of the big husky.\n\nFor a few seconds he forgot Gray Wolf. The husky had slipped back like a\nshadow and now he stood again over Gray Wolf, sniffing her neck and\nbody. Then he whined. In that whine were the passion, the invitation,\nthe demand of the Wild. So quickly that the eye could scarcely follow\nher movement faithful Gray Wolf sank her gleaming fangs in the husky's\nshoulder.\n\nA gray streak--nothing more tangible than a streak of gray, silent and\nterrible, shot through the dawn-gloom. It was Kazan. He came without a\nsnarl, without a cry, and in a moment he and the husky were in the\nthroes of terrific battle.\n\nThe four other huskies ran in quickly and stood waiting a dozen paces\nfrom the combatants. Gray Wolf lay crouched on her belly. The giant\nhusky and the quarter-strain wolf-dog were not fighting like sledge-dog\nor wolf. For a few moments rage and hatred made them fight like\nmongrels. Both had holds. Now one was down, and now the other, and so\nswiftly did they change their positions that the four waiting\nsledge-dogs were puzzled and stood motionless. Under other conditions\nthey would have leaped upon the first of the fighters to be thrown upon\nhis back and torn him to pieces. That was the way of the wolf and the\nwolf-dog. But now they stood back, hesitating and fearful.\n\nThe big husky had never been beaten in battle. Great Dane ancestors had\ngiven him a huge bulk and a jaw that could crush an ordinary dog's head.\nBut in Kazan he was meeting not only the dog and the wolf, but all that\nwas best in the two. And Kazan had the advantage of a few hours of rest\nand a full stomach. More than that, he was fighting for Gray Wolf. His\nfangs had sunk deep in the husky's shoulder, and the husky's long teeth\nmet through the hide and flesh of his neck. An inch deeper, and they\nwould have pierced his jugular. Kazan knew this, as he crunched his\nenemy's shoulder-bone, and every instant--even in their fiercest\nstruggling--he was guarding against a second and more successful lunge\nof those powerful jaws.\n\nAt last the lunge came, and quicker than the wolf itself Kazan freed\nhimself and leaped back. His chest dripped blood, but he did not feel\nthe hurt. They began slowly to circle, and now the watching sledge-dogs\ndrew a step or two nearer, and their jaws drooled nervously and their\nred eyes glared as they waited for the fatal moment. Their eyes were on\nthe big husky. He became the pivot of Kazan's wider circle now, and he\nlimped as he turned. His shoulder was broken. His ears were flattened\nas he watched Kazan.\n\nKazan's ears were erect, and his feet touched the snow lightly. All his\nfighting cleverness and all his caution had returned to him. The blind\nrage of a few moments was gone and he fought now as he had fought his\ndeadliest enemy, the long-clawed lynx. Five times he circled around the\nhusky, and then like a shot he was in, sending his whole weight against\nthe husky's shoulder, with the momentum of a ten-foot leap behind it.\nThis time he did not try for a hold, but slashed at the husky's jaws. It\nwas the deadliest of all attacks when that merciless tribunal of death\nstood waiting for the first fall of the vanquished. The huge dog was\nthrown from his feet. For a fatal moment he rolled upon his side and in\nthe moment his four sledge-mates were upon him. All of their hatred of\nthe weeks and months in which the long-fanged leader had bullied them in\nthe traces was concentrated upon him now and he was literally torn into\npieces.\n\nKazan pranced to Gray Wolf's side and with a joyful whine she laid her\nhead over his neck. Twice he had fought the Fight of Death for her.\nTwice he had won. And in her blindness Gray Wolf's soul--if soul she\nhad--rose in exultation to the cold gray sky, and her breast panted\nagainst Kazan's shoulder as she listened to the crunching of fangs in\nthe flesh and bone of the foe her lord and master had overthrown.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nTHE CALL\n\n\nFollowed days of feasting on the frozen flesh of the old bull. In vain\nGray Wolf tried to lure Kazan off into the forests and the swamps. Day\nby day the temperature rose. There was hunting now. And Gray Wolf wanted\nto be alone--with Kazan. But with Kazan, as with most men, leadership\nand power roused new sensations. And he was the leader of the dog-pack,\nas he had once been a leader among the wolves. Not only Gray Wolf\nfollowed at his flank now, but the four huskies trailed behind him. Once\nmore he was experiencing that triumph and strange thrill that he had\nalmost forgotten and only Gray Wolf, in that eternal night of her\nblindness, felt with dread foreboding the danger into which his newly\nachieved czarship might lead him.\n\nFor three days and three nights they remained in the neighborhood of the\ndead moose, ready to defend it against others, and yet each day and\neach night growing less vigilant in their guard. Then came the fourth\nnight, on which they killed a young doe. Kazan led in that chase and for\nthe first time, in the excitement of having the pack at his back, he\nleft his blind mate behind. When they came to the kill he was the first\nto leap at its soft throat. And not until he had begun to tear at the\ndoe's flesh did the others dare to eat. He was master. He could send\nthem back with a snarl. At the gleam of his fangs they crouched\nquivering on their bellies in the snow.\n\nKazan's blood was fomented with brute exultation, and the excitement and\nfascination that came in the possession of new power took the place of\nGray Wolf each day a little more. She came in half an hour after the\nkill, and there was no longer the lithesome alertness to her slender\nlegs, or gladness in the tilt of her ears or the poise of her head. She\ndid not eat much of the doe. Her blind face was turned always in Kazan's\ndirection. Wherever he moved she followed with her unseeing eyes, as if\nexpecting each moment his old signal to her--that low throat-note that\nhad called to her so often when they were alone in the wilderness.\n\nIn Kazan, as leader of the pack, there was working a curious change. If\nhis mates had been wolves it would not have been difficult for Gray Wolf\nto have lured him away. But Kazan was among his own kind. He was a dog.\nAnd they were dogs. Fires that had burned down and ceased to warm him\nflamed up in him anew. In his life with Gray Wolf one thing had\noppressed him as it could not oppress her, and that thing was\nloneliness. Nature had created him of that kind which requires\ncompanionship--not of one but of many. It had given him birth that he\nmight listen to and obey the commands of the voice of man. He had grown\nto hate men, but of the dogs--his kind--he was a part. He had been happy\nwith Gray Wolf, happier than he had ever been in the companionship of\nmen and his blood-brothers. But he had been a long time separated from\nthe life that had once been his and the call of blood made him for a\ntime forget. And only Gray Wolf, with that wonderful super-instinct\nwhich nature was giving her in place of her lost sight, foresaw the end\nto which it was leading him.\n\nEach day the temperature continued to rise until when the sun was\nwarmest the snow began to thaw a little. This was two weeks after the\nfight near the bull. Gradually the pack had swung eastward, until it was\nnow fifty miles east and twenty miles south of the old home under the\nwindfall. More than ever Gray Wolf began to long for their old nest\nunder the fallen trees. Again with those first promises of spring in\nsunshine and air, there was coming also for the second time in her life\nthe promise of approaching motherhood.\n\nBut her efforts to draw Kazan back were unavailing, and in spite of her\nprotest he wandered each day a little farther east and south at the head\nof his pack.\n\nInstinct impelled the four huskies to move in that direction. They had\nnot yet been long enough a part of the wild to forget the necessity of\nman and in that direction there was man. In that direction, and not far\nfrom them now, was the Hudson Bay Company's post to which they and their\ndead master owed their allegiance. Kazan did not know this, but one day\nsomething happened to bring back visions and desires that widened still\nmore the gulf between him and Gray Wolf.\n\nThey had come to the cap of a ridge when something stopped them. It was\na man's voice crying shrilly that word of long ago that had so often\nstirred the blood in Kazan's own veins--\"_m'hoosh! m'hoosh!\nm'hoosh!\"_--and from the ridge they looked down upon the open space of\nthe plain, where a team of six dogs was trotting ahead of a sledge, with\na man running behind them, urging them on at every other step with that\ncry of \"_m'hoosh! m'hoosh! m'hoosh!\"_\n\nTrembling and undecided, the four huskies and the wolf-dog stood on the\nridge with Gray Wolf cringing behind them. Not until man and dogs and\nsledge had disappeared did they move, and then they trotted down to the\ntrail and sniffed at it whiningly and excitedly. For a mile or two they\nfollowed it, Kazan and his mates going fearlessly in the trail. Gray\nWolf hung back, traveling twenty yards to the right of them, with the\nhot man-scent driving the blood feverishly through her brain. Only her\nlove for Kazan--and the faith she still had in him--kept her that near.\n\nAt the edge of a swamp Kazan halted and turned away from the trail. With\nthe desire that was growing in him there was still that old suspicion\nwhich nothing could quite wipe out--the suspicion that was an\ninheritance of his quarter-strain of wolf. Gray Wolf whined joyfully\nwhen he turned into the forest, and drew so close to him that her\nshoulder rubbed against Kazan's as they traveled side by side.\n\nThe \"slush\" snows followed fast after this. And the \"slush\" snows meant\nspring--and the emptying of the wilderness of human life. Kazan and his\nmates soon began to scent the presence and the movement of this life.\nThey were now within thirty miles of the post. For a hundred miles on\nall sides of them the trappers were moving in with their late winter's\ncatch of furs. From east and west, south and north, all trails led to\nthe post. The pack was caught in the mesh of them. For a week not a day\npassed that they did not cross a fresh trail, and sometimes two or\nthree.\n\nGray Wolf was haunted by constant fear. In her blindness she knew that\nthey were surrounded by the menace of men. To Kazan what was coming to\npass had more and more ceased to fill him with fear and caution. Three\ntimes that week he heard the shouts of men--and once he heard a white\nman's laughter and the barking of dogs as their master tossed them their\ndaily feed of fish. In the air he caught the pungent scent of camp-fires\nand one night, in the far distance, he heard a wild snatch of song,\nfollowed by the yelping and barking of a dog-pack.\n\nSlowly and surely the lure of man drew him nearer to the post--a mile\nto-night, two miles to-morrow, but always nearer. And Gray Wolf,\nfighting her losing fight to the end, sensed in the danger-filled air\nthe nearness of that hour when he would respond to the final call and\nshe would be left alone.\n\nThese were days of activity and excitement at the fur company's post,\nthe days of accounting, of profit and of pleasure;--the days when the\nwilderness poured in its treasure of fur, to be sent a little later to\nLondon and Paris and the capitals of Europe. And this year there was\nmore than the usual interest in the foregathering of the forest people.\nThe plague had wrought its terrible havoc, and not until the fur-hunters\nhad come to answer to the spring roll-call would it be known accurately\nwho had lived and who had died.\n\nThe Chippewans and half-breeds from the south began to arrive first,\nwith their teams of mongrel curs, picked up along the borders of\ncivilization. Close after them came the hunters from the western barren\nlands, bringing with them loads of white fox and caribou skins, and an\narmy of big-footed, long-legged Mackenzie hounds that pulled like horses\nand wailed like whipped puppies when the huskies and Eskimo dogs set\nupon them. Packs of fierce Labrador dogs, never vanquished except by\ndeath, came from close to Hudson's Bay. Team after team of little yellow\nand gray Eskimo dogs, as quick with their fangs as were their black and\nswift-running masters with their hands and feet, met the much larger and\ndark-colored Malemutes from the Athabasca. Enemies of all these packs of\nfierce huskies trailed in from all sides, fighting, snapping and\nsnarling, with the lust of killing deep born in them from their wolf\nprogenitors.\n\nThere was no cessation in the battle of the fangs. It began with the\nfirst brute arrivals. It continued from dawn through the day and around\nthe camp-fires at night. There was never an end to the strife between\nthe dogs, and between the men and the dogs. The snow was trailed and\nstained with blood and the scent of it added greater fierceness to the\nwolf-breeds.\n\nHalf a dozen battles were fought to the death each day and night. Those\nthat died were chiefly the south-bred curs--mixtures of mastiff, Great\nDane, and sheep-dog--and the fatally slow Mackenzie hounds. About the\npost rose the smoke of a hundred camp-fires, and about these fires\ngathered the women and the children of the hunters. When the snow was no\nlonger fit for sledging, Williams, the factor, noted that there were\nmany who had not come, and the accounts of these he later scratched out\nof his ledgers knowing that they were victims of the plague.\n\nAt last came the night of the Big Carnival, For weeks and months women\nand children and men had been looking forward to this. In scores of\nforest cabins, in smoke-blackened tepees, and even in the frozen homes\nof the little Eskimos, anticipation of this wild night of pleasure had\ngiven an added zest to life. It was the Big Circus--the good time given\ntwice each year by the company to its people.\n\nThis year, to offset the memory of plague and death, the factor had put\nforth unusual exertions. His hunters had killed four fat caribou. In the\nclearing there were great piles of dry logs, and in the center of all\nthere rose eight ten-foot tree-butts crotched at the top; and from\ncrotch to crotch there rested a stout sapling stripped of bark, and on\neach sapling was spitted the carcass of a caribou, to be roasted whole\nby the heat of the fire beneath. The fires were lighted at dusk, and\nWilliams himself started the first of those wild songs of the\nNorthland--the song of the caribou, as the flames leaped up into the\ndark night.\n\n  \"Oh, ze cariboo-oo-oo, ze cariboo-oo-oo,\n    He roas' on high,\n    Jes' under ze sky.\n  air-holes beeg white cariboo-oo-oo!\"\n\n\"Now!\" he yelled. \"Now--all together!\" And carried away by his\nenthusiasm, the forest people awakened from their silence of months,\nand the song burst forth in a savage frenzy that reached to the skies.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTwo miles to the south and west that first thunder of human voice\nreached the ears of Kazan and Gray Wolf and the masterless huskies. And\nwith the voices of men they heard now the excited howlings of dogs. The\nhuskies faced the direction of the sounds, moving restlessly and\nwhining. For a few moments Kazan stood as though carven of rock. Then he\nturned his head, and his first look was to Gray Wolf. She had slunk back\na dozen feet and lay crouched under the thick cover of a balsam shrub.\nHer body, legs and neck were flattened in the snow. She made no sound,\nbut her lips were drawn back and her teeth shone white.\n\nKazan trotted back to her, sniffed at her blind face and whined. Gray\nWolf still did not move. He returned to the dogs and his jaws opened and\nclosed with a snap. Still more clearly came the wild voice of the\ncarnival, and no longer to be held back by Kazan's leadership, the four\nhuskies dropped their heads and slunk like shadows in its direction.\nKazan hesitated, urging Gray Wolf. But not a muscle of Gray Wolf's body\nmoved. She would have followed him in face of fire but not in face of\nman. Not a sound escaped her ears. She heard the quick fall of Kazan's\nfeet as he left her. In another moment she knew that he was gone.\nThen--and not until then--did she lift her head, and from her soft\nthroat there broke a whimpering cry.\n\nIt was her last call to Kazan. But stronger than that there was running\nthrough Kazan's excited blood the call of man and of dog. The huskies\nwere far in advance of him now and for a few moments he raced madly to\novertake them. Then he slowed down until he was trotting, and a hundred\nyards farther on he stopped. Less than a mile away he could see where\nthe flames of the great fires were reddening the sky. He gazed back to\nsee if Gray Wolf was following and then went on until he struck an open\nand hard traveled trail. It was beaten with the footprints of men and\ndogs, and over it two of the caribou had been dragged a day or two\nbefore.\n\nAt last he came to the thinned out strip of timber that surrounded the\nclearing and the flare of the flames was in his eyes. The bedlam of\nsound that came to him now was like fire in his brain. He heard the song\nand the laughter of men, the shrill cries of women and children, the\nbarking and snarling and fighting of a hundred dogs. He wanted to rush\nout and join them, to become again a part of what he had once been. Yard\nby yard he sneaked through the thin timber until he reached the edge of\nthe clearing. There he stood in the shadow of a spruce and looked out\nupon life as he had once lived it, trembling, wistful and yet hesitating\nin that final moment.\n\nA hundred yards away was the savage circle of men and dogs and fire. His\nnostrils were filled with the rich aroma of the roasting caribou, and as\nhe crouched down, still with that wolfish caution that Gray Wolf had\ntaught him, men with long poles brought the huge carcasses crashing down\nupon the melting snow about the fires. In one great rush the horde of\nwild revelers crowded in with bared knives, and a snarling mass of dogs\nclosed in behind them. In another moment he had forgotten Gray Wolf, had\nforgotten all that man and the wild had taught him, and like a gray\nstreak was across the open.\n\nThe dogs were surging back when he reached them, with half a dozen of\nthe factor's men lashing them in the faces with long caribou-gut whips.\nThe sting of a lash fell in a fierce cut over an Eskimo dog's shoulder,\nand in snapping at the lash his fangs struck Kazan's rump. With\nlightning swiftness Kazan returned the cut, and in an instant the jaws\nof the dogs had met. In another instant they were down and Kazan had the\nEskimo dog by the throat.\n\nWith shouts the men rushed in. Again and again their whips cut like\nknives through the air. Their blows fell on Kazan, who was uppermost,\nand as he felt the burning pain of the scourging whips there flooded\nthrough him all at once the fierce memory of the days of old--the days\nof the Club and the Lash. He snarled. Slowly he loosened his hold of the\nEskimo dog's throat. And then, out of the m\u00c3\u00aal\u00c3\u00a9e of dogs and men, there\nsprang another man--_with a club_! It fell on Kazan's back and the force\nof it sent him flat into the snow. It was raised again. Behind the club\nthere was a face--a brutal, fire-reddened face. It was such a face that\nhad driven Kazan into the wild, and as the club fell again he evaded the\nfull weight of its blow and his fangs gleamed like ivory knives. A third\ntime the club was raised, and this time Kazan met it in mid-air, and his\nteeth ripped the length of the man's forearm.\n\n\"Good God!\" shrieked the man in pain, and Kazan caught the gleam of a\nrifle barrel as he sped toward the forest. A shot followed. Something\nlike a red-hot coal ran the length of Kazan's hip, and deep in the\nforest he stopped to lick at the burning furrow where the bullet had\ngone just deep enough to take the skin and hair from his flesh.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGray Wolf was still waiting under the balsam shrub when Kazan returned\nto her. Joyously she sprang forth to meet him. Once more the man had\nsent back the old Kazan to her. He muzzled her neck and face, and stood\nfor a few moments with his head resting across her back, listening to\nthe distant sound.\n\nThen, with ears laid flat, he set out straight into the north and west.\nAnd now Gray Wolf ran shoulder to shoulder with him like the Gray Wolf\nof the days before the dog-pack came; for that wonderful thing that lay\nbeyond the realm of reason told her that once more she was comrade and\nmate, and that their trail that night was leading to their old home\nunder the windfall.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nHIS SON\n\n\nIt happened that Kazan was to remember three things above all others. He\ncould never quite forget his old days in the traces, though they were\ngrowing more shadowy and indistinct in his memory as the summers and the\nwinters passed. Like a dream there came to him a memory of the time he\nhad gone down to Civilization. Like dreams were the visions that rose\nbefore him now and then of the face of the First Woman, and of the faces\nof masters who--to him--had lived ages ago. And never would he quite\nforget the Fire, and his fights with man and beast, and his long chases\nin the moonlight. But two things were always with him as if they had\nbeen but yesterday, rising clear and unforgetable above all others, like\nthe two stars in the North that never lost their brilliance. One was\nWoman. The other was the terrible fight of that night on the top of the\nSun Rock, when the lynx had blinded forever his wild mate, Gray Wolf.\nCertain events remain indelibly fixed in the minds of men; and so, in a\nnot very different way, they remain in the minds of beasts. It takes\nneither brain nor reason to measure the depths of sorrow or of\nhappiness. And Kazan in his unreasoning way knew that contentment and\npeace, a full stomach, and caresses and kind words instead of blows had\ncome to him through Woman, and that comradeship in the wilderness--faith,\nloyalty and devotion--were a part of Gray Wolf. The third unforgetable\nthing was about to occur in the home they had found for themselves under\nthe swamp windfall during the days of cold and famine.\n\nThey had left the swamp over a month before when it was smothered deep\nin snow. On the day they returned to it the sun was shining warmly in\nthe first glorious days of spring warmth. Everywhere, big and small,\nthere were the rushing torrents of melting snows and the crackle of\ncrumbling ice, the dying cries of thawing rock and earth and tree, and\neach night for many nights past the cold pale glow of the aurora\nborealis had crept farther and farther toward the Pole in fading glory.\nSo early as this the poplar buds had begun to swell and the air was\nfilled with the sweet odor of balsam, spruce and cedar. Where there had\nbeen famine and death and stillness six weeks before, Kazan and Gray\nWolf now stood at the edge of the swamp and breathed the earthy smells\nof spring, and listened to the sounds of life. Over their heads a pair\nof newly-mated moose-birds fluttered and scolded at them. A big jay sat\npluming himself in the sunshine. Farther in they heard the crack of a\nstick broken under a heavy hoof. From the ridge behind them they caught\nthe raw scent of a mother bear, busy pulling down the tender poplar buds\nfor her six-weeks-old cubs, born while she was still deep in her winter\nsleep.\n\nIn the warmth of the sun and the sweetness of the air there breathed to\nGray Wolf the mystery of matehood and of motherhood. She whined softly\nand rubbed her blind face against Kazan. For days, in her way, she tried\nto tell him. More than ever she wanted to curl herself up in that warm\ndry nest under the windfall. She had no desire to hunt. The crack of\nthe dry stick under a cloven hoof and the warm scent of the she-bear and\nher cubs roused none of the old instincts in her. She wanted to curl\nherself up in the old windfall--and wait. And she tried hard to make\nKazan understand her desire.\n\nNow that the snow was gone they found that a narrow creek lay between\nthem and the knoll on which the windfall was situated. Gray Wolf picked\nup her ears at the tumult of the little torrent. Since the day of the\nFire, when Kazan and she had saved themselves on the sand-bar, she had\nceased to have the inherent wolf horror of water. She followed\nfearlessly, even eagerly, behind Kazan as he sought a place where they\ncould ford the rushing little stream. On the other side Kazan could see\nthe big windfall. Gray Wolf could _smell_ it and she whined joyously,\nwith her blind face turned toward it. A hundred yards up the stream a\nbig cedar had fallen over it and Kazan began to cross. For a moment Gray\nWolf hesitated, and then followed. Side by side they trotted to the\nwindfall. With their heads and shoulders in the dark opening to their\nnest they scented the air long and cautiously. Then they entered. Kazan\nheard Gray Wolf as she flung herself down on the dry floor of the snug\ncavern. She was panting, not from exhaustion, but because she was filled\nwith a sensation of contentment and happiness. In the darkness Kazan's\nown jaws fell apart. He, too, was glad to get back to their old home. He\nwent to Gray Wolf and, panting still harder, she licked his face. It had\nbut one meaning. And Kazan understood.\n\nFor a moment he lay down beside her, listening, and eyeing the opening\nto their nest. Then he began to sniff about the log walls. He was close\nto the opening when a sudden fresh scent came to him, and he grew rigid,\nand his bristles stood up. The scent was followed by a whimpering,\nbabyish chatter. A porcupine entered the opening and proceeded to\nadvance in its foolish fashion, still chattering in that babyish way\nthat has made its life inviolable at the hands of man. Kazan had heard\nthat sound before, and like all other beasts had learned to ignore the\npresence of the innocuous creature that made it. But just now he did not\nstop to consider that what he saw was a porcupine and that at his first\nsnarl the good-humored little creature would waddle away as fast as it\ncould, still chattering baby talk to itself. His first reasoning was\nthat it was a live thing invading the home to which Gray Wolf and he had\njust returned. A day later, or perhaps an hour later, he would have\ndriven it back with a growl. Now he leaped upon it.\n\nA wild chattering, intermingled with pig-like squeaks, and then a rising\nstaccato of howls followed the attack. Gray Wolf sprang to the opening.\nThe porcupine was rolled up in a thousand-spiked ball a dozen feet away,\nand she could hear Kazan tearing about in the throes of the direst agony\nthat can befall a beast of the forests. His face and nose were a mat of\nquills. For a few moments he rolled and dug in the wet mold and earth,\npawing madly at the things that pierced his flesh. Then he set off like\nall dogs will who have come into contact with the friendly porcupine,\nand raced again and again around the windfall, howling at every jump.\nGray Wolf took the matter coolly. It is possible that at times there are\nmoments of humor in the lives of animals. If so, she saw this one. She\nscented the porcupine and she knew that Kazan was full of quills. As\nthere was nothing to do and nothing to fight she sat back on her\nhaunches and waited, pricking up her ears every time Kazan passed her in\nhis mad circuit around the windfall. At his fourth or fifth heat the\nporcupine smoothed itself down a little, and continuing the interrupted\nthread of its chatter waddled to a near-by poplar, climbed it and began\nto gnaw the tender bark from a limb.\n\nAt last Kazan halted before Gray Wolf. The first agony of a hundred\nlittle needles piercing his flesh had deadened into a steady burning\npain. Gray Wolf went over to him and investigated him cautiously. With\nher teeth she seized the ends of two or three of the quills and pulled\nthem out. Kazan was very much dog now. He gave a yelp, and whimpered as\nGray Wolf jerked out a second bunch of quills. Then he flattened himself\non his belly, stretched out his forelegs, closed his eyes, and without\nany other sound except an occasional yelp of pain allowed Gray Wolf to\ngo on with the operation. Fortunately he had escaped getting any of the\nquills in his mouth and tongue. But his nose and jaws were soon red\nwith blood. For an hour Gray Wolf kept faithfully at her task and by the\nend of that time had succeeded in pulling out most of the quills. A few\nstill remained, too short and too deeply inbedded for her to extract\nwith her teeth.\n\nAfter this Kazan went down to the creek and buried his burning muzzle in\nthe cold water. This gave him some relief, but only for a short time.\nThe quills that remained worked their way deeper and deeper into his\nflesh, like living things. Nose and lips began to swell. Blood and\nsaliva dripped from his mouth and his eyes grew red. Two hours after\nGray Wolf had retired to her nest under the windfall a quill had\ncompletely pierced his lip and began to prick his tongue. In desperation\nKazan chewed viciously upon a piece of wood. This broke and crumpled the\nquill, and destroyed its power to do further harm. Nature had told him\nthe one thing to do to save himself. Most of that day he spent in\ngnawing at wood and crunching mouthfuls of earth and mold between his\njaws. In this way the barb-toothed points of the quills were dulled and\nbroken as they came through. At dusk he crawled under the windfall, and\nGray Wolf gently licked his muzzle with her soft cool tongue. Frequently\nduring the night Kazan went to the creek and found relief in its\nice-cold water.\n\nThe next day he had what the forest people call \"porcupine mumps.\" His\nface was swollen until Gray Wolf would have laughed if she had been\nhuman, and not blind. His chops bulged like cushions. His eyes were mere\nslits. When he went out into the day he blinked, for he could see\nscarcely better than his sightless mate. But the pain was mostly gone.\nThe night that followed he began to think of hunting, and the next\nmorning before it was yet dawn he brought a rabbit into their den. A few\nhours later he would have brought a spruce partridge to Gray Wolf, but\njust as he was about to spring upon his feathered prey the soft chatter\nof a porcupine a few yards away brought him to a sudden stop. Few things\ncould make Kazan drop his tail. But that inane and incoherent prattle of\nthe little spiked beast sent him off at double-quick with his tail\nbetween his legs. As man abhors and evades the creeping serpent, so\nKazan would hereafter evade this little creature of the forests that\nnever in animal history has been known to lose its good-humor or pick a\nquarrel.\n\nTwo weeks of lengthening days, of increasing warmth, of sunshine and\nhunting, followed Kazan's adventure with the porcupine. The last of the\nsnow went rapidly. Out of the earth began to spring tips of green. The\n_bakneesh_ vine glistened redder each day, the poplar buds began to\nsplit, and in the sunniest spots, between the rocks of the ridges the\nlittle white snow-flowers began to give a final proof that spring had\ncome. For the first of those two weeks Gray Wolf hunted frequently with\nKazan. They did not go far. The swamp was alive with small game and each\nday or night they killed fresh meat. After the first week Gray Wolf\nhunted less. Then came the soft and balmy night, glorious in the\nradiance of a full spring moon when she refused to leave the windfall.\nKazan did not urge her. Instinct made him understand, and he did not go\nfar from the windfall that night in his hunt. When he returned he\nbrought a rabbit.\n\nCame then the night when from the darkest corner of the windfall Gray\nWolf warned him back with a low snarl. He stood in the opening, a rabbit\nbetween his jaws. He took no offense at the snarl, but stood for a\nmoment, gazing into the gloom where Gray Wolf had hidden herself. Then\nhe dropped the rabbit and lay down squarely in the opening. After a\nlittle he rose restlessly and went outside. But he did not leave the\nwindfall. It was day when he reentered. He sniffed, as he had sniffed\nonce before a long time ago, between the boulders at the top of the Sun\nRock. That which was in the air was no longer a mystery to him. He came\nnearer and Gray Wolf did not snarl. She whined coaxingly as he touched\nher. Then his muzzle found something else. It was soft and warm and made\na queer little sniffling sound. There was a responsive whine in his\nthroat, and in the darkness came the quick soft caress of Gray Wolf's\ntongue. Kazan returned to the sunshine and stretched himself out before\nthe door of the windfall. His jaws dropped open, for he was filled with\na strange contentment.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nTHE EDUCATION OF BA-REE\n\n\nRobbed once of the joys of parenthood by the murder on the Sun Rock,\nboth Gray Wolf and Kazan were different from what they would have been\nhad the big gray lynx not come into their lives at that time. As if it\nwere but yesterday they remembered the moonlit night when the lynx\nbrought blindness to Gray Wolf and destroyed her young, and when Kazan\nhad avenged himself and his mate in his terrible fight to the death with\ntheir enemy. And now, with that soft little handful of life snuggling\nclose up against her, Gray Wolf saw through her blind eyes the tragic\npicture of that night more vividly than ever and she quivered at every\nsound, ready to leap in the face of an unseen foe, to rend all flesh\nthat was not the flesh of Kazan. And ceaselessly, the slightest sound\nbringing him to his feet, Kazan watched and guarded. He mistrusted the\nmoving shadows. The snapping of a twig drew back his upper lip. His\nfangs gleamed menacingly when the soft air brought a strange scent. In\nhim, too, the memory of the Sun Rock, the death of their first young and\nthe blinding of Gray Wolf, had given birth to a new instinct. Not for an\ninstant was he off his guard. As surely as one expects the sun to rise\nso did he expect that sooner or later their deadly enemy would creep on\nthem from out of the forest. In another hour such as this the lynx had\nbrought death. The lynx had brought blindness. And so day and night he\nwaited and watched for the lynx to come again. And woe unto any other\ncreature of flesh and blood that dared approach the windfall in these\nfirst days of Gray Wolf's motherhood!\n\nBut peace had spread its wings of sunshine and plenty over the swamp.\nThere were no intruders, unless the noisy whisky-jacks, the big-eyed\nmoose-birds, the chattering bush sparrows, and the wood-mice and ermine\ncould be called such. After the first day or two Kazan went more\nfrequently into the windfall, and though more than once he nosed\nsearchingly about Gray Wolf he could find only the one little pup. A\nlittle farther west the Dog-Ribs would have called the pup Ba-ree for\ntwo reasons--because he had no brothers or sisters, and because he was a\nmixture of dog and wolf. He was a sleek and lively little fellow from\nthe beginning, for there was no division of mother strength and\nattention. He developed with the true swiftness of the wolf-whelp, and\nnot with the slowness of the dog-pup.\n\nFor three days he was satisfied to cuddle close against his mother,\nfeeding when he was hungry, sleeping a great deal and preened and\nlaundered almost constantly by Gray Wolf's affectionate tongue. From the\nfourth day he grew busier and more inquisitive with every hour. He found\nhis mother's blind face, with tremendous effort he tumbled over her\npaws, and once he lost himself completely and sniffled for help when he\nrolled fifteen or eighteen inches away from her. It was not long after\nthis that he began to recognize Kazan as a part of his mother, and he\nwas scarcely more than a week old when he rolled himself up contentedly\nbetween Kazan's forelegs and went to sleep. Kazan was puzzled. Then\nwith a deep sigh Gray Wolf laid her head across one of her mate's\nforelegs, with her nose touching her runaway baby, and seemed vastly\ncontented. For half an hour Kazan did not move.\n\nWhen he was ten days old Ba-ree discovered there was great sport in\ntussling with a bit of rabbit fur. It was a little later when he made\nhis second exciting discovery--light and sunshine. The sun had now\nreached a point where in the middle of the afternoon a bright gleam of\nit found its way through an overhead opening in the windfall. At first\nBa-ree would only stare at the golden streak. Then came the time when he\ntried to play with it as he played with the rabbit fur. Each day\nthereafter he went a little nearer the opening through which Kazan\npassed from the windfall into the big world outside. Finally came the\ntime when he reached the opening and crouched there, blinking and\nfrightened at what he saw, and now Gray Wolf no longer tried to hold him\nback but went out into the sunshine and tried to call him to her. It was\nthree days before his weak eyes had grown strong enough to permit his\nfollowing her, and very quickly after that Ba-ree learned to love the\nsun, the warm air, and the sweetness of life, and to dread the darkness\nof the closed-in den where he had been born.\n\nThat this world was not altogether so nice as it at first appeared he\nwas very soon to learn. At the darkening signs of an approaching storm\none day Gray Wolf tried to lure him back under the windfall. It was her\nfirst warning to Ba-ree and he did not understand. Where Gray Wolf\nfailed, nature came to teach a first lesson. Ba-ree was caught in a\nsudden deluge of rain. It flattened him out in pure terror and he was\ndrenched and half drowned before Gray Wolf caught him between her jaws\nand carried him into shelter. One by one after this the first strange\nexperiences of life came to him, and one by one his instincts received\ntheir birth. Greatest for him of the days to follow was that on which\nhis inquisitive nose touched the raw flesh of a freshly killed and\nbleeding rabbit. It was his first taste of blood. It was sweet. It\nfilled him with a strange excitement and thereafter he knew what it\nmeant when Kazan brought in something between his jaws. He soon began\nto battle with sticks in place of the soft fur and his teeth grew as\nhard and as sharp as little needles.\n\nThe Great Mystery was bared to him at last when Kazan brought in between\nhis jaws, a big rabbit that was still alive but so badly crushed that it\ncould not run when dropped to the ground. Ba-ree had learned to know\nwhat rabbits and partridges meant--the sweet warm blood that he loved\nbetter even than he had ever loved his mother's milk. But they had come\nto him dead. He had never seen one of the monsters alive. And now the\nrabbit that Kazan dropped to the ground, kicking and struggling with a\nbroken back, sent Ba-ree back appalled. For a few moments he wonderingly\nwatched the dying throes of Kazan's prey. Both Kazan and Gray Wolf\nseemed to understand that this was to be Ba-ree's first lesson in his\neducation as a slaying and flesh-eating creature, and they stood close\nover the rabbit, making no effort to end its struggles. Half a dozen\ntimes Gray Wolf sniffed at the rabbit and then turned her blind face\ntoward Ba-ree. After the third or fourth time Kazan stretched himself\nout on his belly a few feet away and watched the proceedings\nattentively. Each time that Gray Wolf lowered her head to muzzle the\nrabbit Ba-ree's little ears shot up expectantly. When he saw that\nnothing happened and that his mother was not hurt he came a little\nnearer. Soon he could reach out, stiff-legged and cautious, and touch\nthe furry thing that was not yet dead.\n\nIn a last spasmodic convulsion the big rabbit doubled up its rear legs\nand gave a kick that sent Ba-ree sprawling back, yelping in terror. He\nregained his feet and then, for the first time, anger and the desire to\nretaliate took possession of him. The kick had completed his first\neducation. He came back with less caution, but stiffer-legged, and a\nmoment later had dug his tiny teeth in the rabbit's neck. He could feel\nthe throb of life in the soft body, the muscles of the dying rabbit\ntwitched convulsively under him, and he hung with his teeth until there\nwas no longer a tremor of life in his first kill. Gray Wolf was\ndelighted. She caressed Ba-ree with her tongue, and even Kazan\ncondescended to sniff approvingly of his son when he returned to the\nrabbit. And never before had warm sweet blood tasted so good to Ba-ree\nas it did to-day.\n\nSwiftly Ba-ree developed from a blood-tasting into a flesh-eating\nanimal. One by one the mysteries of life were unfolded to him--the\nmating-night chortle of the gray owl, the crash of a falling tree, the\nroll of thunder, the rush of running water, the scream of a fisher-cat,\nthe mooing of the cow moose, and the distant call of his tribe. But\nchief of all these mysteries that were already becoming a part of his\ninstinct was the mystery of scent. One day he wandered fifty yards away\nfrom the windfall and his little nose touched the warm scent of a\nrabbit. Instantly, without reasoning or further process of education, he\nknew that to get at the sweet flesh and blood which he loved he must\nfollow the scent. He wriggled slowly along the trail until he came to a\nbig log, over which the rabbit had vaulted in a long leap, and from this\nlog he turned back. Each day after this he went on adventures of his\nown. At first he was like an explorer without a compass in a vast and\nunknown world. Each day he encountered something new, always wonderful,\nfrequently terrifying. But his terrors grew less and less and his\nconfidence correspondingly greater. As he found that none of the things\nhe feared did him any harm he became more and more bold in his\ninvestigations. And his appearance was changing, as well as his view of\nthings. His round roly-poly body was taking a different form. He became\nlithe and quick. The yellow of his coat darkened, and there was a\nwhitish-gray streak along his back like that along Kazan's. He had his\nmother's under-throat and her beautiful grace of head. Otherwise he was\na true son of Kazan. His limbs gave signs of future strength and\nmassiveness. He was broad across the chest. His eyes were wide apart,\nwith a little red in the lower corners. The forest people know what to\nexpect of husky pups who early develop that drop of red. It is a warning\nthat they are born of the wild and that their mothers, or fathers, are\nof the savage hunt-packs. In Ba-ree that tinge of red was so pronounced\nthat it could mean but one thing. While he was almost half dog, the wild\nhad claimed him forever.\n\nNot until the day of his first real battle with a living creature did\nBa-ree come fully into his inheritance. He had gone farther than usual\nfrom the windfall--fully a hundred yards. Here he found a new wonder. It\nwas the creek. He had heard it before and he had looked down on it from\nafar--from a distance of fifty yards at least. But to-day he ventured\ngoing to the edge of it, and there he stood for a long time, with the\nwater rippling and singing at his feet, gazing across it into the new\nworld that he saw. Then he moved cautiously along the stream. He had not\ngone a dozen steps when there was a furious fluttering close to him, and\none of the fierce big-eyed jays of the Northland was directly in his\npath. It could not fly. One of its wings dragged, probably broken in a\nstruggle with some one of the smaller preying beasts. But for an instant\nit was a most startling and defiant bit of life to Ba-ree.\n\nThen the grayish crest along his back stiffened and he advanced. The\nwounded jay remained motionless until Ba-ree was within three feet of\nit. In short quick hops it began to retreat. Instantly Ba-ree's\nindecision had flown to the four winds. With one sharp excited yelp he\nflew at the defiant bird. For a few moments there was a thrilling race,\nand Ba-ree's sharp little teeth buried themselves in the jay's feathers.\nSwift as a flash the bird's beak began to strike. The jay was the king\nof the smaller birds. In nesting season it killed the brush sparrows,\nthe mild-eyed moose-birds, and the tree-sappers. Again and again it\nstruck Ba-ree with its powerful beak, but the son of Kazan had now\nreached the age of battle and the pain of the blows only made his own\nteeth sink deeper. At last he found the flesh; and a puppyish snarl rose\nin his throat. Fortunately he had gained a hold under the wing and after\nthe first dozen blows the jay's resistance grew weaker. Five minutes\nlater Ba-ree loosened his teeth and drew back a step to look at the\ncrumpled and motionless creature before him. The jay was dead. He had\nwon his first battle. And with victory came the wonderful dawning of\nthat greatest instinct of all, which told him that no longer was he a\ndrone in the marvelous mechanism of wilderness life--but a part of it\nfrom this time forth. _For he had killed_.\n\nHalf an hour later Gray Wolf came down over his trail. The jay was torn\ninto bits. Its feathers were scattered about and Ba-ree's little nose\nwas bloody. Ba-ree was lying in triumph beside his victim. Swiftly Gray\nWolf understood and caressed him joyously. When they returned to the\nwindfall Ba-ree carried in his jaws what was left of the jay.\n\nFrom that hour of his first kill hunting became the chief passion of\nBa-ree's life. When he was not sleeping in the sun, or under the\nwindfall at night, he was seeking life that he could destroy. He\nslaughtered an entire family of wood-mice. Moose-birds were at first the\neasiest for him to stalk, and he killed three. Then he encountered an\nermine and the fierce little white outlaw of the forests gave him his\nfirst defeat. Defeat cooled his ardor for a few days, but taught him the\ngreat lesson that there were other fanged and flesh-eating animals\nbesides himself and that nature had so schemed things that fang must not\nprey upon fang--_for food_. Many things had been born in him.\nInstinctively he shunned the porcupine without experiencing the torture\nof its quills. He came face to face with a fisher-cat one day, a\nfortnight after his fight with the ermine. Both were seeking food, and\nas there was no food between them to fight over, each went his own way.\n\nFarther and farther Ba-ree ventured from the windfall, always following\nthe creek. Sometimes he was gone for hours. At first Gray Wolf was\nrestless when he was away, but she seldom went with him and after a time\nher restlessness left her. Nature was working swiftly. It was Kazan who\nwas restless now. Moonlight nights had come and the wanderlust was\ngrowing more and more insistent in his veins. And Gray Wolf, too, was\nfilled with the strange longing to roam at large out into the big world.\n\nCame then the afternoon when Ba-ree went on his longest hunt. Half a\nmile away he killed his first rabbit. He remained beside it until dusk.\nThe moon rose, big and golden, flooding the forests and plains and\nridges with a light almost like that of day. It was a glorious night.\nAnd Ba-ree found the moon, and left his kill. And the direction in\nwhich he traveled _was away from the windfall_.\n\nAll that night Gray Wolf watched and waited. And when at last the moon\nwas sinking into the south and west she settled back on her haunches,\nturned her blind face to the sky and sent forth her first howl since the\nday Ba-ree was born. Nature had come into her own. Far away Ba-ree\nheard, but he did not answer. A new world was his. He had said good-by\nto the windfall--and home.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nTHE USURPERS\n\n\nIt was that glorious season between spring and summer, when the northern\nnights were brilliant with moon and stars, that Kazan and Gray Wolf set\nup the valley between the two ridges on a long hunt. It was the\nbeginning of that _wanderlust_ which always comes to the furred and\npadded creatures of the wilderness immediately after the young-born of\nearly spring have left their mothers to find their own way in the big\nworld. They struck west from their winter home under the windfall in the\nswamp. They hunted mostly at night and behind them they left a trail\nmarked by the partly eaten carcasses of rabbits and partridges. It was\nthe season of slaughter and not of hunger. Ten miles west of the swamp\nthey killed a fawn. This, too, they left after a single meal. Their\nappetites became satiated with warm flesh and blood. They grew sleek and\nfat and each day they basked longer in the warm sunshine. They had few\nrivals. The lynxes were in the heavier timber to the south. There were\nno wolves. Fisher-cat, marten and mink were numerous along the creek,\nbut these were neither swift-hunting nor long-fanged. One day they came\nupon an old otter. He was a giant of his kind, turning a whitish gray\nwith the approach of summer. Kazan, grown fat and lazy, watched him\nidly. Blind Gray Wolf sniffed at the fishy smell of him in the air. To\nthem he was no more than a floating stick, a creature out of their\nelement, along with the fish, and they continued on their way not\nknowing that this uncanny creature with the coal-like flappers was soon\nto become their ally in one of the strange and deadly feuds of the\nwilderness, which are as sanguinary to animal life as the deadliest\nfeuds of men are to human life.\n\nThe day following their meeting with the otter Gray Wolf and Kazan\ncontinued three miles farther westward, still following the stream. Here\nthey encountered the interruption to their progress which turned them\nover the northward ridge. The obstacle was a huge beaver dam. The dam\nwas two hundred yards in width and flooded a mile of swamp and timber\nabove it. Neither Gray Wolf nor Kazan was deeply interested in beavers.\nThey also moved out of their element, along with the fish and the otter\nand swift-winged birds.\n\nSo they turned into the north, not knowing that nature had already\nschemed that they four--the dog, wolf, otter and beaver--should soon be\nengaged in one of those merciless struggles of the wild which keep\nanimal life down to the survival of the fittest, and whose tragic\nhistories are kept secret under the stars and the moon and the winds\nthat tell no tales.\n\nFor many years no man had come into this valley between the two ridges\nto molest the beaver. If a Sarcee trapper had followed down the nameless\ncreek and had caught the patriarch and chief of the colony, he would at\nonce have judged him to be very old and his Indian tongue would have\ngiven him a name. He would have called him Broken Tooth, because one of\nthe four long teeth with which he felled trees and built dams was broken\noff. Six years before Broken Tooth had led a few beavers of his own age\ndown the stream, and they had built their first small dam and their\nfirst lodge. The following April Broken Tooth's mate had four little\nbaby beavers, and each of the other mothers in the colony increased the\npopulation by two or three or four. At the end of the fourth year this\nfirst generation of children, had they followed the usual law of nature,\nwould have mated and left the colony to build a dam and lodges of their\nown. They mated, but did not emigrate.\n\nThe next year the second generation of children, now four years old,\nmated but did not leave, so that in this early summer of the sixth year\nthe colony was very much like a great city that had been long besieged\nby an enemy. It numbered fifteen lodges and over a hundred beavers, not\ncounting the fourth babies which had been born during March and April.\nThe dam had been lengthened until it was fully two hundred yards in\nlength. Water had been made to flood large areas of birch and poplar and\ntangled swamps of tender willow and elder. Even with this food was\ngrowing scarce and the lodges were overcrowded. This was because\nbeavers are almost human in their love for home. Broken Tooth's lodge\nwas fully nine feet long by seven wide inside, and there were now living\nin it children and grandchildren to the number of twenty-seven. For this\nreason Broken Tooth was preparing to break the precedent of his tribe.\nWhen Kazan and Gray Wolf sniffed carelessly at the strong scents of the\nbeaver city, Broken Tooth was marshaling his family, and two of his sons\nand their families, for the exodus.\n\nAs yet Broken Tooth was the recognized leader in the colony. No other\nbeaver had grown to his size and strength. His thick body was fully\nthree feet long. He weighed at least sixty pounds. His tail was fourteen\ninches in length and five in width, and on a still night he could strike\nthe water a blow that could be heard a quarter of a mile away. His\nwebbed hindfeet were twice as large as his mate's and he was easily the\nswiftest swimmer in the colony.\n\nFollowing the afternoon when Gray Wolf and Kazan struck into the north\ncame the clear still night when Broken Tooth climbed to the top of the\ndam, shook himself, and looked down to see that his army was behind\nhim. The starlit water of the big pond rippled and flashed with the\nmovement of many bodies. A few of the older beavers clambered up after\nBroken Tooth and the old patriarch plunged down into the narrow stream\non the other side of the dam. Now the shining silken bodies of the\nemigrants followed him in the starlight. In ones and twos and threes\nthey climbed over the dam and with them went a dozen children born three\nmonths before. Easily and swiftly they began the journey down-stream,\nthe youngsters swimming furiously to keep up with their parents. In all\nthey numbered forty. Broken Tooth swam well in the lead, with his older\nworkers and battlers behind him. In the rear followed mothers and\nchildren.\n\nAll of that night the journey continued. The otter, their deadliest\nenemy--deadlier even than man--hid himself in a thick clump of willows\nas they passed. Nature, which sometimes sees beyond the vision of man,\nhad made him the enemy of these creatures that were passing his\nhiding-place in the night. A fish-feeder, he was born to be a conserver\nas well as a destroyer of the creatures on which he fed. Perhaps nature\ntold him that too many beaver dams stopped the run of spawning fish and\nthat where there were many beavers there were always few fish. Maybe he\nreasoned as to why fish-hunting was poor and he went hungry. So, unable\nto cope singly with whole tribes of his enemies, he worked to destroy\ntheir dams. How this, in turn, destroyed the beavers will be seen in the\nfeud in which nature had already schemed that he should play a part with\nKazan and Gray Wolf.\n\nA dozen times during this night Broken Tooth halted to investigate the\nfood supplies along the banks. But in the two or three places where he\nfound plenty of the bark on which they lived it would have been\ndifficult to have constructed a dam. His wonderful engineering instincts\nrose even above food instincts. And when each time he moved onward, no\nbeaver questioned his judgment by remaining behind. In the early dawn\nthey crossed the burn and came to the edge of the swamp domain of Kazan\nand Gray Wolf. By right of discovery and possession that swamp belonged\nto the dog and the wolf. In every part of it they had left their mark of\nownership. But Broken Tooth was a creature of the water and the scent of\nhis tribe was not keen. He led on, traveling more slowly when they\nentered the timber. Just below the windfall home of Kazan and Gray Wolf\nhe halted, and clambering ashore balanced himself upright on his webbed\nhindfeet and broad four-pound tail. Here he had found ideal conditions.\nA dam could be constructed easily across the narrow stream, and the\nwater could be made to flood a big supply of poplar, birch, willow and\nalder. Also the place was sheltered by heavy timber, so that the winters\nwould be warm. Broken Tooth quickly gave his followers to understand\nthat this was to be their new home. On both sides of the stream they\nswarmed into the near-by timber. The babies began at once to nibble\nhungrily at the tender bark of willow and alder. The older ones, every\none of them now a working engineer, investigated excitedly, breakfasting\nby nibbling off a mouthful of bark now and then.\n\nThat day the work of home-building began. Broken Tooth himself selected\na big birch that leaned over the stream, and began the work of cutting\nthrough the ten-inch butt with his three long teeth. Though the old\npatriarch had lost one tooth, the three that remained had not\ndeteriorated with age. The outer edge of them was formed of the hardest\nenamel; the inner side was of soft ivory. They were like the finest\nsteel chisels, the enamel never wearing away and the softer ivory\nreplacing itself year by year as it was consumed. Sitting on his\nhindlegs, with his forepaws resting against the tree and with his heavy\ntail giving him a firm balance, Broken Tooth began gnawing a narrow ring\nentirely around the tree. He worked tirelessly for several hours, and\nwhen at last he stopped to rest another workman took up the task.\nMeanwhile a dozen beavers were hard at work cutting timber. Long before\nBroken Tooth's tree was ready to fall across the stream, a smaller\npoplar crashed into the water. The cutting on the big birch was in the\nshape of an hour-glass. In twenty hours it fell straight across the\ncreek. While the beaver prefers to do most of his work at night he is a\nday-laborer as well, and Broken Tooth gave his tribe but little rest\nduring the days that followed. With almost human intelligence the little\nengineers kept at their task. Smaller trees were felled, and these were\ncut into four or five foot lengths. One by one these lengths were rolled\nto the stream, the beavers pushing them with their heads and forepaws,\nand by means of brush and small limbs they were fastened securely\nagainst the birch. When the framework was completed the wonderful cement\nconstruction was begun. In this the beavers were the masters of men.\nDynamite was the only force that could hereafter break up what they were\nbuilding now. Under their cup-like chins the beavers brought from the\nbanks a mixture of mud and fine twigs, carrying from half a pound to a\npound at a load and began filling up the framework with it. Their task\nseemed tremendous, and yet Broken Tooth's engineers could carry a ton of\nthis mud and twig mixture during a day and night. In three days the\nwater was beginning to back, until it rose about the butts of a dozen or\nmore trees and was flooding a small area of brush. This made work\neasier. From now on materials could be cut in the water and easily\nfloated. While a part of the beaver colony was taking advantage of the\nwater, others were felling trees end to end with the birch, laying the\nworking frame of a dam a hundred feet in width.\n\nThey had nearly accomplished this work when one morning Kazan and Gray\nWolf returned to the swamp.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nA FEUD IN THE WILDERNESS\n\n\nA soft wind blowing from the south and east brought the scent of the\ninvaders to Gray Wolf's nose when they were still half a mile away. She\ngave the warning to Kazan and he, too, found the strange scent in the\nair. It grew stronger as they advanced. When two hundred yards from the\nwindfall they heard the sudden crash of a falling tree, and stopped. For\na full minute they stood tense and listening. Then the silence was\nbroken by a squeaking cry, followed by a splash. Gray Wolf's alert ears\nfell back and she turned her blind face understandingly toward Kazan.\nThey trotted ahead slowly, approaching the windfall from behind. Not\nuntil they had reached the top of the knoll on which it was situated did\nKazan begin to see the wonderful change that had taken place during\ntheir absence. Astounded, they stood while he stared. There was no\nlonger a little creek below them. Where it had been was a pond that\nreached almost to the foot of the knoll. It was fully a hundred feet in\nwidth and the backwater had flooded the trees and bush for five or six\ntimes that distance toward the burn. They had come up quietly and Broken\nTooth's dull-scented workers were unaware of their presence. Not fifty\nfeet away Broken Tooth himself was gnawing at the butt of a tree. An\nequal distance to the right of him four or five of the baby beavers were\nat play building a miniature dam of mud and tiny twigs. On the opposite\nside of the pond was a steep bank six or seven feet high, and here a few\nof the older children--two years old, but still not workmen--were having\ngreat fun climbing the bank and using it as a toboggan-slide. It was\ntheir splashing that Kazan and Gray Wolf had heard. In a dozen different\nplaces the older beavers were at work.\n\nA few weeks before Kazan had looked upon a similar scene when he had\nreturned into the north from Broken Tooth's old home. It had not\ninterested him then. But a quick and thrilling change swept through him\nnow. The beavers had ceased to be mere water animals, uneatable and\nwith an odor that displeased him. They were invaders--and enemies. His\nfangs bared silently. His crest stiffened like the hair of a brush, and\nthe muscles of his forelegs and shoulders stood out like whipcords. Not\na sound came from him as he rushed down upon Broken Tooth. The old\nbeaver was oblivious of danger until Kazan was within twenty feet of\nhim. Naturally slow of movement on land, he stood for an instant\nstupefied. Then he swung down from the tree as Kazan leaped upon him.\nOver and over they rolled to the edge of the bank, carried on by the\ndog's momentum. In another moment the thick heavy body of the beaver had\nslipped like oil from under Kazan and Broken Tooth was safe in his\nelement, two holes bitten clean through his fleshy tail. Baffled in his\neffort to get a death-hold on Broken Tooth, Kazan swung like a flash to\nthe right. The young beavers had not moved. Astonished and frightened at\nwhat they had seen, they stood as if stupefied. Not until they saw Kazan\ntearing toward them did they awaken to action. Three of them reached the\nwater. The fourth and fifth--baby beavers not more than three months\nold--were too late. With a single snap of his jaw Kazan broke the hack\nof one. The other he pinned down by the throat and shook as a terrier\nshakes a rat. When Gray Wolf trotted down to him both of the little\nbeavers were dead. She sniffed at their soft little bodies and whined.\nPerhaps the baby creatures reminded her of runaway Ba-ree, her own baby,\nfor there was a note of longing in her whine as she nosed them. It was\nthe mother whine.\n\nBut if Gray Wolf had visions of her own Kazan understood nothing of\nthem. He had killed two of the creatures that had dared to invade their\nhome. To the little beavers he had been as merciless as the gray lynx\nthat had murdered Gray Wolf's first children on the top of the Sun Rock.\nNow that he had sunk his teeth into the flesh of his enemies his blood\nwas filled with a frenzied desire to kill. He raved along the edge of\nthe pond, snarling at the uneasy water under which Broken Tooth had\ndisappeared. All of the beavers had taken refuge in the pond, and its\nsurface was heaving with the passing of many bodies beneath. Kazan came\nto the end of the dam. This was new. Instinctively he knew that it was\nthe work of Broken Tooth and his tribe and for a few moments he tore\nfiercely at the matted sticks and limbs. Suddenly there was an upheaval\nof water close to the dam, fifty feet out from the bank, and Broken\nTooth's big gray head appeared. For a tense half minute Broken Tooth and\nKazan measured each other at that distance. Then Broken Tooth drew his\nwet shining body out of the water to the top of the dam, and squatted\nflat, facing Kazan. The old patriarch was alone. Not another beaver had\nshown himself.\n\nThe surface of the pond had now become quiet. Vainly Kazan tried to\ndiscover a footing that would allow him to reach the watchful invader.\nBut between the solid wall of the dam and the bank there was a tangled\nframework through which the water rushed with some violence. Three times\nKazan fought to work his way through that tangle, and three times his\nefforts ended in sudden plunges into the water. All this time Broken\nTooth did not move. When at last Kazan gave up the attack the old\nengineer slipped over the edge of the dam and disappeared under the\nwater. He had learned that Kazan, like the lynx, could not fight water\nand he spread the news among the members of his colony.\n\nGray Wolf and Kazan returned to the windfall and lay down in the warm\nsun. Half an hour later Broken Tooth drew himself out on the opposite\nshore of the pond. He was followed by other beavers. Across the water\nthey resumed their work as if nothing had happened. The tree-cutters\nreturned to their trees. Half a dozen worked in the water, carrying\nloads of cement and twigs. The middle of the pond was their dead-line.\nAcross this not one of them passed. A dozen times during the hour that\nfollowed one of the beavers swam up to the dead-line, and rested there,\nlooking at the shining little bodies of the babies that Kazan had\nkilled. Perhaps it was the mother, and perhaps some finer instinct\nunknown to Kazan told this to Gray Wolf. For Gray Wolf went down twice\nto sniff at the dead bodies, and each time--without seeing--she went\nwhen the mother beaver had come to the dead-line.\n\nThe first fierce animus had worn itself from Kazan's blood, and he now\nwatched the beavers closely. He had learned that they were not fighters.\nThey were many to one and yet they ran from him like a lot of rabbits.\nBroken Tooth had not even struck at him, and slowly it grew upon him\nthat these invading creatures that used both the water and land would\nhave to be hunted as he stalked the rabbit and the partridge. Early in\nthe afternoon he slipped off into the bush, followed by Gray Wolf. He\nhad often begun the stalking of a rabbit by moving _away_ from it and he\nemployed this wolf trick now with the beavers. Beyond the windfall he\nturned and began trotting up the creek, with the wind. For a quarter of\na mile the creek was deeper than it had ever been. One of their old\nfording places was completely submerged, and at last Kazan plunged in\nand swam across, leaving Gray Wolf to wait for him on the windfall side\nof the stream.\n\nAlone he made his way quickly in the direction of the dam, traveling two\nhundred yards back from the creek. Twenty yards below the dam a dense\nthicket of alder and willow grew close to the creek and Kazan took\nadvantage of this. He approached within a leap or two of the dam without\nbeing seen and crouched close to the ground, ready to spring forth when\nthe opportunity came. Most of the beavers were now working in the water.\nThe four or five still on shore were close to the water and some\ndistance up-stream. After a wait of several minutes Kazan was almost on\nthe point of staking everything on a wild rush upon his enemies when a\nmovement on the dam attracted his attention. Half-way out two or three\nbeavers were at work strengthening the central structure with cement.\nSwift as a flash Kazan darted from his cover to the shelter behind the\ndam. Here the water was very shallow, the main portion of the stream\nfinding a passage close to the opposite shore. Nowhere did it reach to\nhis belly as he waded out. He was completely hidden from the beavers,\nand the wind was in his favor. The noise of running water drowned what\nlittle sound he made. Soon he heard the beaver workmen over him. The\nbranches of the fallen birch gave him a footing, and he clambered up.\n\nA moment later his head and shoulders appeared above the top of the\ndam. Scarce an arm's length away Broken Tooth was forcing into place a\nthree-foot length of poplar as big around as a man's arm. He was so busy\nthat he did not hear or see Kazan. Another beaver gave the warning as he\nplunged into the pond. Broken Tooth looked up, and his eyes met Kazan's\nbared fangs. There was no time to turn. He threw himself back, but it\nwas a moment too late. Kazan was upon him. His long fangs sank deep into\nBroken Tooth's neck. But the old beaver had thrown himself enough back\nto make Kazan lose his footing. At the same moment his chisel-like teeth\ngot a firm hold of the loose skin at Kazan's throat. Thus clinched, with\nKazan's long teeth buried almost to the beaver's jugular, they plunged\ndown into the deep water of the pond.\n\nBroken Tooth weighed sixty pounds. The instant he struck the water he\nwas in his element, and holding tenaciously to the grip he had obtained\non Kazan's neck he sank like a chunk of iron. Kazan was pulled\ncompletely under. The water rushed into his mouth, his ears, eyes and\nnose. He was blinded, and his senses were a roaring tumult. But instead\nof struggling to free himself he held his breath and buried his teeth\ndeeper. They touched the soft bottom and for a moment floundered in the\nmud. Then Kazan loosened his hold. He was fighting for his own life\nnow--and not for Broken Tooth's. With all of the strength of his\npowerful limbs he struggled to break loose--to rise to the surface, to\nfresh air, to life. He clamped his jaws shut, knowing that to breathe\nwas to die. On land he could have freed himself from Broken Tooth's hold\nwithout an effort. But under water the old beaver's grip was more deadly\nthan would have been the fangs of a lynx ashore. There was a sudden\nswirl of water as a second beaver circled close about the struggling\npair. Had he closed in with Broken Tooth, Kazan's struggles would\nquickly have ceased.\n\nBut nature had not foreseen the day when Broken Tooth would be fighting\nwith fang. The old patriarch had no particular reason now for holding\nKazan down. He was not vengeful. He did not thirst for blood or death.\nFinding that he was free, and that this strange enemy that had twice\nleaped upon him could do him no harm, he loosed his hold. It was not a\nmoment too soon for Kazan. He was struggling weakly when he rose to the\nsurface of the water. Three-quarters drowned, he succeeded in raising\nhis forepaws over a slender branch that projected from the dam. This\ngave him time to fill his lungs with air, and to cough forth the water\nthat had almost ended his existence. For ten minutes he clung to the\nbranch before he dared attempt the short swim ashore. When he reached\nthe bank he dragged himself up weakly. All the strength was gone from\nhis body. His limbs shook. His jaws hung loose. He was beaten--completely\nbeaten. And a creature without a fang had worsted him. He felt the\nabasement of it. Drenched and slinking, he went to the windfall, lay\ndown in the sun, and waited for Gray Wolf.\n\nDays followed in which Kazan's desire to destroy his beaver enemies\nbecame the consuming passion of his life. Each day the dam became more\nformidable. Cement work in the water was carried on by the beavers\nswiftly and safely. The water in the pond rose higher each twenty-four\nhours, and the pond grew steadily wider. The water had now been turned\ninto the depression that encircled the windfall, and in another week or\ntwo, if the beavers continued their work, Kazan's and Gray Wolf's home\nwould be nothing more than a small island in the center of a wide area\nof submerged swamp.\n\nKazan hunted only for food now, and not for pleasure. Ceaselessly he\nwatched his opportunity to leap upon incautious members of Broken\nTooth's tribe. The third day after the struggle under the water he\nkilled a big beaver that approached too close to the willow thicket. The\nfifth day two of the young beavers wandered into the flooded depression\nback of the windfall and Kazan caught them in shallow water and tore\nthem into pieces. After these successful assaults the beavers began to\nwork mostly at night. This was to Kazan's advantage, for he was a\nnight-hunter. On each of two consecutive nights he killed a beaver.\nCounting the young, he had killed seven when the otter came.\n\nNever had Broken Tooth been placed between two deadlier or more\nferocious enemies than the two that now assailed him. On shore Kazan\nwas his master because of his swiftness, keener scent, and fighting\ntrickery. In the water the otter was a still greater menace. He was\nswifter than the fish that he caught for food. His teeth were like steel\nneedles. He was so sleek and slippery that it would have been impossible\nfor them to hold him with their chisel-like teeth could they have caught\nhim. The otter, like the beaver, possessed no hunger for blood. Yet in\nall the Northland he was the greatest destroyer of their kind--an even\ngreater destroyer than man. He came and passed like a plague, and it was\nin the coldest days of winter that greatest destruction came with him.\nIn those days he did not assault the beavers in their snug houses. He\ndid what man could do only with dynamite--made an embrasure through\ntheir dam. Swiftly the water would fall, the surface ice would crash\ndown, and the beaver houses would be left out of water. Then followed\ndeath for the beavers--starvation and cold. With the protecting water\ngone from about their houses, the drained pond a chaotic mass of broken\nice, and the temperature forty or fifty degrees below zero, they would\ndie within a few hours. For the beaver, with his thick coat of fur, can\nstand less cold than man. Through all the long winter the water about\nhis home is as necessary to him as fire to a child.\n\nBut it was summer now and Broken Tooth and his colony had no very great\nfear of the otter. It would cost them some labor to repair the damage he\ndid, but there was plenty of food and it was warm. For two days the\notter frisked about the dam and the deep water of the pond. Kazan took\nhim for a beaver, and tried vainly to stalk him. The otter regarded\nKazan suspiciously and kept well out of his way. Neither knew that the\nother was an ally. Meanwhile the beavers continued their work with\ngreater caution. The water in the pond had now risen to a point where\nthe engineers had begun the construction of three lodges. On the third\nday the destructive instinct of the otter began its work. He began to\nexamine the dam, close down to the foundation. It was not long before he\nfound a weak spot to begin work on, and with his sharp teeth and small\nbullet-like head he commenced his drilling operations. Inch by inch he\nworked his way through the dam, burrowing and gnawing over and under the\ntimbers, and always through the cement. The round hole he made was fully\nseven inches in diameter. In six hours he had cut it through the\nfive-foot base of the dam.\n\nA torrent of water began to rush from the pond as if forced out by a\nhydraulic pump. Kazan and Gray Wolf were hiding in the willows on the\nsouth side of the pond when this happened. They heard the roar of the\nstream tearing through the embrasure and Kazan saw the otter crawl up to\nthe top of the dam and shake himself like a huge water-rat. Within\nthirty minutes the water in the pond had fallen perceptibly, and the\nforce of the water pouring through the hole was constantly increasing\nthe outlet. In another half hour the foundations of the three lodges,\nwhich had been laid in about ten inches of water, stood on mud. Not\nuntil Broken Tooth discovered that the water was receding from the\nhouses did he take alarm. He was thrown into a panic, and very soon\nevery beaver in the colony tearing excitedly about the pond. They swam\nswiftly from shore to shore, paying no attention to the dead-line now.\nBroken Tooth and the older workmen made for the dam, and with a snarling\ncry the otter plunged down among them and out like a flash for the creek\nabove the pond. Swiftly the water continued to fall and as it fell the\nexcitement of the beavers increased. They forgot Kazan and Gray Wolf.\n\nSeveral of the younger members of the colony drew themselves ashore on\nthe windfall side of the pond, and whining softly Kazan was about to\nslip back through the willows when one of the older beavers waddled up\nthrough the deepening mud close on his ambush. In two leaps Kazan was\nupon him, with Gray Wolf a leap behind him. The short fierce struggle in\nthe mud was seen by the other beavers and they crossed swiftly to the\nopposite side of the pond. The water had receded to a half of its\ngreatest width before Broken Tooth and his workmen discovered the breach\nin the wall of the dam. The work of repair was begun at once. For this\nwork sticks and brush of considerable size were necessary, and to reach\nthis material the beavers were compelled to drag their heavy bodies\nthrough the ten or fifteen yards of soft mud left by the falling water.\nPeril of fang no longer kept them back. Instinct told them that they\nwere fighting for their existence--that if the embrasure were not filled\nup and the water kept in the pond they would very soon be completely\nexposed to their enemies. It was a day of slaughter for Gray Wolf and\nKazan. They killed two more beavers in the mud close to the willows.\nThen they crossed the creek below the dam and cut off three beavers in\nthe depression behind the windfall. There was no escape for these three.\nThey were torn into pieces. Farther up the creek Kazan caught a young\nbeaver and killed it.\n\nLate in the afternoon the slaughter ended. Broken Tooth and his\ncourageous engineers had at last repaired the breach, and the water in\nthe pond began to rise.\n\nHalf a mile up the creek the big otter was squatted on a log basking in\nthe last glow of the setting sun. To-morrow he would go and do over\nagain his work of destruction. That was his method. For him it was play.\n\nBut that strange and unseen arbiter of the forests called O-ee-ki, \"the\nSpirit,\" by those who speak the wild tongue, looked down at last with\nmercy upon Broken Tooth and his death-stricken tribe. For in that last\nglow of sunset Kazan and Gray Wolf slipped stealthily up the creek--to\nfind the otter basking half asleep on the log.\n\nThe day's work, a full stomach, and the pool of warm sunlight in which\nhe lay had all combined to make the otter sleepy. He was as motionless\nas the log on which he had stretched himself. He was big and gray and\nold. For ten years he had lived to prove his cunning superior to that of\nman. Vainly traps had been set for him. Wily trappers had built narrow\nsluice-ways of rock and tree in small streams for him, but the old otter\nhad foiled their cunning and escaped the steel jaws waiting at the lower\nend of each sluice. The trail he left in soft mud told of his size. A\nfew trappers had seen him. His soft pelt would long ago have found its\nway to London, Paris or Berlin had it not been for his cunning. He was\nfit for a princess, a duke or an emperor. For ten years he had lived\nand escaped the demands of the rich.\n\nBut this was summer. No trapper would have killed him now, for his pelt\nwas worthless. Nature and instinct both told him this. At this season he\ndid not dread man, for there was no man to dread. So he lay asleep on\nthe log, oblivious to everything but the comfort of sleep and the warmth\nof the sun.\n\nSoft-footed, searching still for signs of the furry enemies who had\ninvaded their domain, Kazan slipped along the creek. Gray Wolf ran close\nat his shoulder. They made no sound, and the wind was in their\nfavor--bringing scents toward them. It brought the otter smell. To Kazan\nand Gray Wolf it was the scent of a water animal, rank and fishy, and\nthey took it for the beaver. They advanced still more cautiously. Then\nKazan saw the big otter asleep on the log and he gave the warning to\nGray Wolf. She stopped, standing with her head thrown up, while Kazan\nmade his stealthy advance. The otter stirred uneasily. It was growing\ndusk. The golden pool of sunlight had faded away. Back in the darkening\ntimber an owl greeted night with its first-low call. The otter breathed\ndeeply. His whiskered muzzle twitched. He was awakening--stirring--when\nKazan leaped upon him. Face to face, in fair fight, the old otter could\nhave given a good account of himself. But there was no chance now. The\nwild itself had for the first time in his life become his deadliest\nenemy. It was not man now--but O-ee-ki, \"the Spirit,\" that had laid its\nhand upon him. And from the Spirit there was no escape. Kazan's fangs\nsank into his soft jugular. Perhaps he died without knowing what it was\nthat had leaped upon him. For he died--quickly, and Kazan and Gray Wolf\nwent on their way, hunting still for enemies to slaughter, and not\nknowing that in the otter they had killed the one ally who would have\ndriven the beavers from their swamp home.\n\nThe days that followed grew more and more hopeless for Kazan and Gray\nWolf. With the otter gone Broken Tooth and his tribe held the winning\nhand. Each day the water backed a little farther into the depression\nsurrounding the windfall. By the middle of July only a narrow strip of\nland connected the windfall hummock with the dry land of the swamp. In\ndeep water the beavers now worked unmolested. Inch by inch the water\nrose, until there came the day when it began to overflow the connecting\nstrip. For the last time Kazan and Gray Wolf passed from their windfall\nhome and traveled up the stream between the two ridges. The creek held a\nnew meaning for them now and as they traveled they sniffed its odors and\nlistened to its sounds with an interest they had never known before. It\nwas an interest mingled a little with fear, for something in the manner\nin which the beavers had beaten them reminded Kazan and Gray Wolf of\n_man_. And that night, when in the radiance of the big white moon they\ncame within scent of the beaver colony that Broken Tooth had left, they\nturned quickly northward into the plains. Thus had brave old Broken\nTooth taught them to respect the flesh and blood and handiwork of his\ntribe.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nA SHOT ON THE SAND-BAR\n\n\nJuly and August of 1911 were months of great fires in the Northland. The\nswamp home of Kazan and Gray Wolf, and the green valley between the two\nridges, had escaped the seas of devastating flame; but now, as they set\nforth on their wandering adventures again, it was not long before their\npadded feet came in contact with the seared and blackened desolation\nthat had followed so closely after the plague and starvation of the\npreceding winter. In his humiliation and defeat, after being driven from\nhis swamp home by the beavers, Kazan led his blind mate first into the\nsouth. Twenty miles beyond the ridge they struck the fire-killed\nforests. Winds from Hudson's Bay had driven the flames in an unbroken\nsea into the west, and they had left not a vestige of life or a patch of\ngreen. Blind Gray Wolf could not see the blackened world, but she\n_sensed_ it. It recalled to her memory of that other fire, after the\nbattle on the Sun Rock; and all of her wonderful instincts, sharpened\nand developed by her blindness, told her that to the north--and not\nsouth--lay the hunting-grounds they were seeking. The strain of dog that\nwas in Kazan still pulled him south. It was not because he sought man,\nfor to man he had now become as deadly an enemy as Gray Wolf herself. It\nwas simply dog instinct to travel southward; in the face of fire it was\nwolf instinct to travel northward. At the end of the third day Gray Wolf\nwon. They recrossed the little valley between the two ridges, and swung\nnorth and west into the Athabasca country, striking a course that would\nultimately bring them to the headwaters of the McFarlane River.\n\nLate in the preceding autumn a prospector had come up to Fort Smith, on\nthe Slave River, with a pickle bottle filled with gold dust and nuggets.\nHe had made the find on the McFarlane. The first mails had taken the\nnews to the outside world, and by midwinter the earliest members of a\ntreasure-hunting horde were rushing into the country by snow-shoe and\ndog-sledge. Other finds came thick and fast. The McFarlane was rich in\nfree gold, and miners by the score staked out their claims along it and\nbegan work. Latecomers swung to new fields farther north and east, and\nto Fort Smith came rumors of \"finds\" richer than those of the Yukon. A\nscore of men at first--then a hundred, five hundred, a thousand--rushed\ninto the new country. Most of these were from the prairie countries to\nthe south, and from the placer beds of the Saskatchewan and the Frazer.\nFrom the far North, traveling by way of the Mackenzie and the Liard,\ncame a smaller number of seasoned prospectors and adventurers from the\nYukon--men who knew what it meant to starve and freeze and die by\ninches.\n\nOne of these late comers was Sandy McTrigger. There were several reasons\nwhy Sandy had left the Yukon. He was \"in bad\" with the police who\npatrolled the country west of Dawson, and he was \"broke.\" In spite of\nthese facts he was one of the best prospectors that had ever followed\nthe shores of the Klondike. He had made discoveries running up to a\nmillion or two, and had promptly lost them through gambling and drink.\nHe had no conscience, and little fear. Brutality was the chief thing\nwritten in his face. His undershot jaw, his wide eyes, low forehead and\ngrizzly mop of red hair proclaimed him at once as a man not to be\ntrusted beyond one's own vision or the reach of a bullet. It was\nsuspected that he had killed a couple of men, and robbed others, but as\nyet the police had failed to get anything \"on\" him. But along with this\nbad side of him, Sandy McTrigger possessed a coolness and a courage\nwhich even his worst enemies could not but admire, and also certain\nmental depths which his unpleasant features did not proclaim.\n\nInside of six months Red Gold City had sprung up on the McFarlane, a\nhundred and fifty miles from Fort Smith, and Fort Smith was five hundred\nmiles from civilization. When Sandy came he looked over the crude\ncollection of shacks, gambling houses and saloons in the new town, and\nmade up his mind that the time was not ripe for any of his \"inside\"\nschemes just yet. He gambled a little, and won sufficient to buy himself\ngrub and half an outfit. A feature of this outfit was an old\nmuzzle-loading rifle. Sandy, who always carried the latest Savage on\nthe market, laughed at it. But it was the best his finances would allow\nof. He started south--up the McFarlane. Beyond a certain point on the\nriver prospectors had found no gold. Sandy pushed confidently _beyond_\nthis point. Not until he was in new country did he begin his search.\nSlowly he worked his way up a small tributary whose headwaters were\nfifty or sixty miles to the south and east. Here and there he found\nfairly good placer gold. He might have panned six or eight dollars'\nworth a day. With this much he was disgusted. Week after week he\ncontinued to work his way up-stream, and the farther he went the poorer\nhis pans became. At last only occasionally did he find colors. After\nsuch disgusting weeks as these Sandy was dangerous--when in the company\nof others. Alone he was harmless.\n\nOne afternoon he ran his canoe ashore on a white strip of sand. This was\nat a bend, where the stream had widened, and gave promise of at least a\nfew colors. He had bent down close to the edge of the water when\nsomething caught his attention on the wet sand. What he saw were the\nfootprints of animals. Two had come down to drink. They had stood side\nby side. And the footprints were fresh--made not more than an hour or\ntwo before. A gleam of interest shot into Sandy's eyes. He looked behind\nhim, and up and down the stream.\n\n\"Wolves,\" he grunted. \"Wish I could 'a' shot at 'em with that old\nminute-gun back there. Gawd--listen to that! And in broad daylight,\ntoo!\"\n\nHe jumped to his feet, staring off into the bush.\n\nA quarter of a mile away Gray Wolf had caught the dreaded scent of man\nin the wind, and was giving voice to her warning. It was a long wailing\nhowl, and not until its last echoes had died away did Sandy McTrigger\nmove. Then he returned to the canoe, took out his old gun, put a fresh\ncap on the nipple and disappeared quickly over the edge of the bank.\n\nFor a week Kazan and Gray Wolf had been wandering about the headwaters\nof the McFarlane and this was the first time since the preceding winter\nthat Gray Wolf had caught the scent of man in the air. When the wind\nbrought the danger-signal to her she was alone. Two or three minutes\nbefore the scent came to her Kazan had left her side in swift pursuit of\na snow-shoe rabbit, and she lay flat on her belly under a bush, waiting\nfor him. In these moments when she was alone Gray Wolf was constantly\nsniffing the air. Blindness had developed her scent and hearing until\nthey were next to infallible. First she had heard the rattle of Sandy\nMcTrigger's paddle against the side of his canoe a quarter of a mile\naway. Scent had followed swiftly. Five minutes after her warning howl\nKazan stood at her side, his head flung up, his jaws open and panting.\nSandy had hunted Arctic foxes, and he was using the Eskimo tactics now,\nswinging in a half-circle until he should come up in the face of the\nwind. Kazan caught a single whiff of the man-tainted air and his spine\ngrew stiff. But blind Gray Wolf was keener than the little red-eyed fox\nof the North. Her pointed nose slowly followed Sandy's progress. She\nheard a dry stick crack under his feet three hundred yards away. She\ncaught the metallic click of his gun-barrel as it struck a birch\nsapling. The moment she lost Sandy in the wind she whined and rubbed\nherself against Kazan and trotted a few steps to the southwest.\n\nAt times such as this Kazan seldom refused to take guidance from her.\nThey trotted away side by side and by the time Sandy was creeping up\nsnake-like with the wind in his face, Kazan was peering from the fringe\nof river brush down upon the canoe on the white strip of sand. When\nSandy returned, after an hour of futile stalking, two fresh tracks led\nstraight down to the canoe. He looked at them in amazement and then a\nsinister grin wrinkled his ugly face. He chuckled as he went to his kit\nand dug out a small rubber bag. From this he drew a tightly corked\nbottle, filled with gelatine capsules. In each little capsule were five\ngrains of strychnine. There were dark hints that once upon a time Sandy\nMcTrigger had tried one of these capsules by dropping it in a cup of\ncoffee and giving it to a man, but the police had never proved it. He\nwas expert in the use of poison. Probably he had killed a thousand foxes\nin his time, and he chuckled again as he counted out a dozen of the\ncapsules and thought how easy it would be to get this inquisitive pair\nof wolves. Two or three days before he had killed a caribou, and each of\nthe capsules he now rolled up in a little ball of deer fat, doing the\nwork with short sticks in place of his fingers, so that there would be\nno man-smell clinging to the death-baits. Before sundown Sandy set out\nat right-angles over the plain, planting the baits. Most of them he hung\nto low bushes. Others he dropped in worn rabbit and caribou trails. Then\nhe returned to the creek and cooked his supper.\n\nThen next morning he was up early, and off to the poison baits. The\nfirst bait was untouched. The second was as he had planted it. The third\nwas gone. A thrill shot through Sandy as he looked about him. Somewhere\nwithin a radius of two or three hundred yards he would find his game.\nThen his glance fell to the ground under the bush where he had hung the\npoison capsule and an oath broke from his lips. The bait had not been\neaten. The caribou fat lay scattered under the bush and still imbedded\nin the largest portion of it was the little white capsule--unbroken. It\nwas Sandy's first experience with a wild creature whose instincts were\nsharpened by blindness, and he was puzzled. He had never known this to\nhappen before. If a fox or a wolf could be lured to the point of\ntouching a bait, it followed that the bait was eaten. Sandy went on to\nthe fourth and the fifth baits. They were untouched. The sixth was torn\nto pieces, like the third. In this instance the capsule was broken and\nthe white powder scattered. Two more poison baits Sandy found pulled\ndown in this manner. He knew that Kazan and Gray Wolf had done the work,\nfor he found the marks of their feet in a dozen different places. The\naccumulated bad humor of weeks of futile labor found vent in his\ndisappointment and anger. At last he had found something tangible to\ncurse. The failure of his poison baits he accepted as a sort of climax\nto his general bad luck. Everything was against him, he believed, and he\nmade up his mind to return to Red Gold City. Early in the afternoon he\nlaunched his canoe and drifted down-stream with the current. He was\ncontent to let the current do all of the work to-day, and he used his\npaddle just enough to keep his slender craft head on. He leaned back\ncomfortably and smoked his pipe, with the old rifle between his knees.\nThe wind was in his face and he kept a sharp watch for game.\n\nIt was late in the afternoon when Kazan and Gray Wolf came out on a\nsand-bar five or six miles down-stream. Kazan was lapping up the cool\nwater when Sandy drifted quietly around a bend a hundred yards above\nthem. If the wind had been right, or if Sandy had been using his paddle,\nGray Wolf would have detected danger. It was the metallic click-click of\nthe old-fashioned lock of Sandy's rifle that awakened her to a sense of\nperil. Instantly she was thrilled by the nearness of it. Kazan heard the\nsound and stopped drinking to face it. In that moment Sandy pressed the\ntrigger. A belch of smoke, a roar of gunpowder, and Kazan felt a red-hot\nstream of fire pass with the swiftness of a lightning-flash through his\nbrain. He stumbled back, his legs gave way under him, and he crumpled\ndown in a limp heap. Gray Wolf darted like a streak off into the bush.\nBlind, she had not seen Kazan wilt down upon the white sand. Not until\nshe was a quarter of a mile away from the terrifying thunder of the\nwhite man's rifle did she stop and wait for him.\n\nSandy McTrigger grounded his canoe on the sand-bar with an exultant\nyell.\n\n\"Got you, you old devil, didn't I?\" he cried. \"I'd 'a' got the other,\ntoo, if I'd 'a' had something besides this damned old relic!\"\n\nHe turned Kazan's head over with the butt of his gun, and the leer of\nsatisfaction in his face gave place to a sudden look of amazement. For\nthe first time he saw the collar about Kazan's neck.\n\n\"My Gawd, it ain't a wolf,\" he gasped. \"It's a dog, Sandy McTrigger--_a\ndog!\"_\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nSANDY'S METHOD\n\n\nMcTrigger dropped on his knees in the sand. The look of exultation was\ngone from his face. He twisted the collar about the dog's limp neck\nuntil he came to the worn plate, on which he could make out the faintly\nengraved letters _K-a-z-a-n_. He spelled the letters out one by one, and\nthe look in his face was of one who still disbelieved what he had seen\nand heard.\n\n\"A dog!\" he exclaimed again. \"A dog, Sandy McTrigger an' a--a beauty!\"\n\nHe rose to his feet and looked down on his victim. A pool of blood lay\nin the white sand at the end of Kazan's nose. After a moment Sandy bent\nover to see where his bullet had struck. His inspection filled him with\na new and greater interest. The heavy ball from the muzzle-loader had\nstruck Kazan fairly on top of the head. It was a glancing blow that had\nnot even broken the skull, and like a flash Sandy understood the\nquivering and twitching of Kazan's shoulders and legs. He had thought\nthat they were the last muscular throes of death. But Kazan was not\ndying. He was only stunned, and would be on his feet again in a few\nminutes. Sandy was a connoisseur of dogs--of dogs that had worn sledge\ntraces. He had lived among them two-thirds of his life. He could tell\ntheir age, their value, and a part of their history at a glance. In the\nsnow he could tell the trail of a Mackenzie hound from that of a\nMalemute, and the track of an Eskimo dog from that of a Yukon husky. He\nlooked at Kazan's feet. They were wolf feet, and he chuckled. Kazan was\npart wild. He was big and powerful, and Sandy thought of the coming\nwinter, and of the high prices that dogs would bring at Red Gold City.\nHe went to the canoe and returned with a roll of stout moose-hide\nbabiche. Then he sat down cross-legged in front of Kazan and began\nmaking a muzzle. He did this by plaiting babiche thongs in the same\nmanner that one does in making the web of a snow-shoe. In ten minutes he\nhad the muzzle over Kazan's nose and fastened securely about his neck.\nTo the dog's collar he then fastened a ten-foot rope of babiche. After\nthat he sat back and waited for Kazan to come to life.\n\nWhen Kazan first lifted his head he could not see. There was a red film\nbefore his eyes. But this passed away swiftly and he saw the man. His\nfirst instinct was to rise to his feet. Three times he fell back before\nhe could stand up. Sandy was squatted six feet from him, holding the end\nof the babiche, and grinning. Kazan's fangs gleamed back. He growled,\nand the crest along his spine rose menacingly. Sandy jumped to his feet.\n\n\"Guess I know what you're figgering on,\" he said. \"I've had _your_ kind\nbefore. The dam' wolves have turned you bad, an' you'll need a whole lot\nof club before you're right again. Now, look here.\"\n\nSandy had taken the precaution of bringing a thick club along with the\nbabiche. He picked it up from where he had dropped it in the sand.\nKazan's strength had fairly returned to him now. He was no longer dizzy.\nThe mist had cleared away from his eyes. Before him he saw once more his\nold enemy, man--man and the club. All of the wild ferocity of his\nnature was roused in an instant. Without reasoning he knew that Gray\nWolf was gone, and that this man was accountable for her going. He knew\nthat this man had also brought him his own hurt, and what he ascribed to\nthe man he also attributed to the club. In his newer undertaking of\nthings, born of freedom and Gray Wolf, Man and Club were one and\ninseparable. With a snarl he leaped at Sandy. The man was not expecting\na direct assault, and before he could raise his club or spring aside\nKazan had landed full on his chest. The muzzle about Kazan's jaws saved\nhim. Fangs that would have torn his throat open snapped harmlessly.\nUnder the weight of the dog's body he fell back, as if struck down by a\ncatapult.\n\nAs quick as a cat he was on his feet again, with the end of the babiche\ntwisted several times about his hand. Kazan leaped again, and this time\nhe was met by a furious swing of the club. It smashed against his\nshoulder, and sent him down in the sand. Before he could recover Sandy\nwas upon him, with all the fury of a man gone mad. He shortened the\nbabiche by twisting it again and again about his hand, and the club rose\nand fell with the skill and strength of one long accustomed to its use.\nThe first blows served only to add to Kazan's hatred of man, and the\nferocity and fearlessness of his attacks. Again and again he leaped in,\nand each time the club fell upon him with a force that threatened to\nbreak his bones. There was a tense hard look about Sandy's cruel mouth.\nHe had never known a dog like this before, and he was a bit nervous,\neven with Kazan muzzled. Three times Kazan's fangs would have sunk deep\nin his flesh had it not been for the babiche. And if the thongs about\nhis jaws should slip, or break--.\n\nSandy followed up the thought with a smashing blow that landed on\nKazan's head, and once more the old battler fell limp upon the sand.\nMcTrigger's breath was coming in quick gasps. He was almost winded. Not\nuntil the club slipped from his hand did he realize how desperate the\nfight had been. Before Kazan recovered from the blow that had stunned\nhim Sandy examined the muzzle and strengthened it by adding another\nbabiche thong. Then he dragged Kazan to a log that high water had\nthrown up on the shore a few yards away and made the end of the babiche\nrope fast to a dead snag. After that he pulled his canoe higher up on\nthe sand, and began to prepare camp for the night.\n\nFor some minutes after Kazan's stunned senses had become normal he lay\nmotionless, watching Sandy McTrigger. Every bone in his body gave him\npain. His jaws were sore and bleeding. His upper lip was smashed where\nthe club had fallen. One eye was almost closed. Several times Sandy came\nnear, much pleased at what he regarded as the good results of the\nbeating. Each time he brought the club. The third time he prodded Kazan\nwith it, and the dog snarled and snapped savagely at the end of it. That\nwas what Sandy wanted--it was an old trick of the dog-slaver. Instantly\nhe was using the club again, until with a whining cry Kazan slunk under\nthe protection of the snag to which he was fastened. He could scarcely\ndrag himself. His right forepaw was smashed. His hindquarters sank under\nhim. For a time after this second beating he could not have escaped had\nhe been free.\n\nSandy was in unusually good humor.\n\n\"I'll take the devil out of you all right,\" he told Kazan for the\ntwentieth time. \"There's nothin' like beatin's to make dogs an' wimmin\nlive up to the mark. A month from now you'll be worth two hundred\ndollars or I'll skin you alive!\"\n\nThree or four times before dusk Sandy worked to rouse Kazan's animosity.\nBut there was no longer any desire left in Kazan to fight. His two\nterrific beatings, and the crushing blow of the bullet against his\nskull, had made him sick. He lay with his head between his forepaws, his\neyes closed, and did not see McTrigger. He paid no attention to the meat\nthat was thrown under his nose. He did not know when the last of the sun\nsank behind the western forests, or when the darkness came. But at last\nsomething roused him from his stupor. To his dazed and sickened brain it\ncame like a call from out of the far past, and he raised his head and\nlistened. Out on the sand McTrigger had built a fire, and the man stood\nin the red glow of it now, facing the dark shadows beyond the shoreline.\nHe, too, was listening. What had roused Kazan came again now--the lost\nmourning cry of Gray Wolf far out on the plain.\n\nWith a whine Kazan was on his feet, tugging at the babiche. Sandy\nsnatched up his club, and leaped toward him.\n\n\"Down, you brute!\" he commanded.\n\nIn the firelight the club rose and fell with ferocious quickness. When\nMcTrigger returned to the fire he was breathing hard again. He tossed\nhis club beside the blankets he had spread out for a bed. It was a\ndifferent looking club now. It was covered with blood and hair.\n\n\"Guess that'll take the spirit out of him,\" he chuckled. \"It'll do\nthat--or kill 'im!\"\n\nSeveral times that night Kazan heard Gray Wolf's call. He whined softly\nin response, fearing the club. He watched the fire until the last embers\nof it died out, and then cautiously dragged himself from under the snag.\nTwo or three times he tried to stand on his feet, but fell back each\ntime. His legs were not broken, but the pain of standing on them was\nexcruciating. He was hot and feverish. All that night he had craved a\ndrink of water. When Sandy crawled out from between his blankets in the\nearly dawn he gave him both meat and water. Kazan drank the water, but\nwould not touch the meat. Sandy regarded the change in him with\nsatisfaction. By the time the sun was up he had finished his breakfast\nand was ready to leave. He approached Kazan fearlessly now, without the\nclub. Untying the babiche he dragged the dog to the canoe. Kazan slunk\nin the sand while his captor fastened the end of the hide rope to the\nstern of the canoe. Sandy grinned. What was about to happen would be fun\nfor him. In the Yukon he had learned how to take the spirit out of dogs.\n\nHe pushed off, bow foremost. Bracing himself with his paddle he then\nbegan to pull Kazan toward the water. In a few moments Kazan stood with\nhis forefeet planted in the damp sand at the edge of the stream. For a\nbrief interval Sandy allowed the babiche to fall slack. Then with a\nsudden powerful pull he jerked Kazan out into the water. Instantly he\nsent the canoe into midstream, swung it quickly down with the current,\nand began to paddle enough to keep the babiche taut about his victim's\nneck. In spite of his sickness and injuries Kazan was now compelled to\nswim to keep his head above water. In the wash of the canoe, and with\nSandy's strokes growing steadily stronger, his position became each\nmoment one of increasing torture. At times his shaggy head was pulled\ncompletely under water. At others Sandy would wait until he had drifted\nalongside, and then thrust him under with the end of his paddle. He grew\nweaker. At the end of a half-mile he was drowning. Not until then did\nSandy pull him alongside and drag him into the canoe. The dog fell limp\nand gasping in the bottom. Brutal though Sandy's methods had been, they\nhad worked his purpose. In Kazan there was no longer a desire to fight.\nHe no longer struggled for freedom. He knew that this man was his\nmaster, and for the time his spirit was gone. All he desired now was to\nbe allowed to lie in the bottom of the canoe, out of reach of the club,\nand safe from the water. The club lay between him and the man. The end\nof it was within a foot or two of his nose, and what he smelled was his\nown blood.\n\nFor five days and five nights the journey down-stream continued, and\nMcTrigger's process of civilizing Kazan was continued in three more\nbeatings with the club, and another resort to the water torture. On the\nmorning of the sixth day they reached Red Gold City, and McTrigger put\nup his tent close to the river. Somewhere he obtained a chain for Kazan,\nand after fastening the dog securely back of the tent he cut off the\nbabiche muzzle.\n\n\"You can't put on meat in a muzzle,\" he told his prisoner. \"An' I want\nyou to git strong--an' fierce as hell. I've got an idee. It's an idee\nyou can lick your weight in wildcats. We'll pull off a stunt pretty soon\nthat'll fill our pockets with dust. I've done it afore, and we can do it\n_here_. Wolf an' dog--s'elp me Gawd but it'll be a drawin' card!\"\n\nTwice a day after this he brought fresh raw meat to Kazan. Quickly\nKazan's spirit and courage returned to him. The soreness left his limbs.\nHis battered jaws healed. And after the fourth day each time that Sandy\ncame with meat he greeted him with the challenge of his snarling fangs.\nMcTrigger did not beat him now. He gave him no fish, no tallow and\nmeal--nothing but raw meat. He traveled five miles up the river to bring\nin the fresh entrail of a caribou that had been killed. One day Sandy\nbrought another man with him and when the stranger came a step too near\nKazan made a sudden swift lunge at him. The man jumped back with a\nstartled oath.\n\n\"He'll do,\" he growled. \"He's lighter by ten or fifteen pounds than the\nDane, but he's got the teeth, an' the quickness, an' he'll give a good\nshow before he goes under.\"\n\n\"I'll make you a bet of twenty-five per cent. of my share that he don't\ngo under,\" offered Sandy.\n\n\"Done!\" said the other. \"How long before he'll be ready?\"\n\nSandy thought a moment.\n\n\"Another week,\" he said. \"He won't have his weight before then. A week\nfrom to-day, we'll say. Next Tuesday night. Does that suit you, Harker?\"\n\nHarker nodded.\n\n\"Next Tuesday night,\" he agreed. Then he added, \"I'll make it a _half_\nof my share that the Dane kills your wolf-dog.\"\n\nSandy took a long look at Kazan.\n\n\"I'll just take you on that,\" he said. Then, as he shook Harker's hand,\n\"I don't believe there's a dog between here and the Yukon that can kill\nthe wolf!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nPROFESSOR McGILL\n\n\nRed Gold City was ripe for a night of relaxation. There had been some\ngambling, a few fights and enough liquor to create excitement now and\nthen, but the presence of the mounted police had served to keep things\nunusually tame compared with events a few hundred miles farther north,\nin the Dawson country. The entertainment proposed by Sandy McTrigger and\nJan Harker met with excited favor. The news spread for twenty miles\nabout Red Gold City and there had never been greater excitement in the\ntown than on the afternoon and night of the big fight. This was largely\nbecause Kazan and the huge Dane had been placed on exhibition, each dog\nin a specially made cage of his own, and a fever of betting began. Three\nhundred men, each of whom was paying five dollars to see the battle,\nviewed the gladiators through the bars of their cages. Harker's dog was\na combination of Great Dane and mastiff, born in the North, and bred to\nthe traces. Betting favored him by the odds of two to one. Occasionally\nit ran three to one. At these odds there was plenty of Kazan money.\nThose who were risking their money on him were the older wilderness\nmen--men who had spent their lives among dogs, and who knew what the red\nglint in Kazan's eyes meant. An old Kootenay miner spoke low in\nanother's ear:\n\n\"I'd bet on 'im even. I'd give odds if I had to. He'll fight all around\nthe Dane. The Dane won't have no method.\"\n\n\"But he's got the weight,\" said the other dubiously. \"Look at his jaws,\nan' his shoulders--\"\n\n\"An' his big feet, an' his soft throat, an' the clumsy thickness of his\nbelly,\" interrupted the Kootenay man. \"For Gawd's sake, man, take my\nword for it, an' don't put your money on the Dane!\"\n\nOthers thrust themselves between them. At first Kazan had snarled at all\nthese faces about him. But now he lay back against the boarded side of\nthe cage and eyed them sullenly from between his forepaws.\n\nThe fight was to be pulled off in Barker's place, a combination of\nsaloon and cafe. The benches and tables had been cleared out and in the\ncenter of the one big room a cage ten feet square rested on a platform\nthree and a half feet from the floor. Seats for the three hundred\nspectators were drawn closely around this. Suspended just above the open\ntop of the cage were two big oil lamps with glass reflectors.\n\nIt was eight o'clock when Harker, McTrigger and two other men bore Kazan\nto the arena by means of the wooden bars that projected from the bottom\nof his cage. The big Dane was already in the fighting cage. He stood\nblinking his eyes in the brilliant light of the reflecting lamps. He\npricked up his ears when he saw Kazan. Kazan did not show his fangs.\nNeither revealed the expected animosity. It was the first they had seen\nof each other, and a murmur of disappointment swept the ranks of the\nthree hundred men. The Dane remained as motionless as a rock when Kazan\nwas prodded from his own cage into the fighting cage. He did not leap or\nsnarl. He regarded Kazan with a dubious questioning poise to his\nsplendid head, and then looked again to the expectant and excited faces\nof the waiting men. For a few moments Kazan stood stiff-legged, facing\nthe Dane. Then his shoulders dropped, and he, too, coolly faced the\ncrowd that had expected a fight to the death. A laugh of derision swept\nthrough the closely seated rows. Catcalls, jeering taunts flung at\nMcTrigger and Harker, and angry voices demanding their money back\nmingled with a tumult of growing discontent. Sandy's face was red with\nmortification and rage. The blue veins in Barker's forehead had swollen\ntwice their normal size. He shook his fist in the face of the crowd, and\nshouted:\n\n\"Wait! Give 'em a chance, you dam' fools!\"\n\nAt his words every voice was stilled. Kazan had turned. He was facing\nthe huge Dane. And the Dane had turned his eyes to Kazan. Cautiously,\nprepared for a lunge or a sidestep, Kazan advanced a little. The Dane's\nshoulders bristled. He, too, advanced upon Kazan. Four feet apart they\nstood rigid. One could have heard a whisper in the room now. Sandy and\nHarker, standing close to the cage, scarcely breathed. Splendid in every\nlimb and muscle, warriors of a hundred fights, and fearless to the point\nof death, the two half-wolf victims of man stood facing each other. None\ncould see the questioning look in their brute eyes. None knew that in\nthis thrilling moment the unseen hand of the wonderful Spirit God of the\nwilderness hovered between them, and that one of its miracles was\ndescending upon them. It was _understanding_. Meeting in the\nopen--rivals in the traces--they would have been rolling in the throes\nof terrific battle. But _here_ came that mute appeal of brotherhood. In\nthe final moment, when only a step separated them, and when men expected\nto see the first mad lunge, the splendid Dane slowly raised his head and\nlooked over Kazan's back through the glare of the lights. Harker\ntrembled, and under his breath he cursed. The Dane's throat was open to\nKazan. But between the beasts had passed the voiceless pledge of peace.\nKazan did not leap. He turned. And shoulder to shoulder--splendid in\ntheir contempt of man--they stood and looked through the bars of their\nprison into the one of human faces.\n\nA roar burst from the crowd--a roar of anger, of demand, of threat. In\nhis rage Harker drew a revolver and leveled it at the Dane. Above the\ntumult of the crowd a single voice stopped him.\n\n\"Hold!\" it demanded. \"Hold--in the name of the law!\"\n\nFor a moment there was silence. Every face turned in the direction of\nthe voice. Two men stood on chairs behind the last row. One was Sergeant\nBrokaw, of the Royal Northwest Mounted. It was he who had spoken. He was\nholding up a hand, commanding silence and attention. On the chair beside\nhim stood another man. He was thin, with drooping shoulders, and a pale\nsmooth face--a little man, whose physique and hollow cheeks told nothing\nof the years he had spent close up along the raw edge of the Arctic. It\nwas he who spoke now, while the sergeant held up his hand. His voice was\nlow and quiet:\n\n\"I'll give the owners five hundred dollars for those dogs,\" he said.\n\nEvery man in the room heard the offer. Harker looked at Sandy. For an\ninstant their heads were close together.\n\n\"They won't fight, and they'll make good team-mates,\" the little man\nwent on. \"I'll give the owners five hundred dollars.\"\n\nHarker raised a hand.\n\n\"Make it six,\" he said. \"Make it six and they're yours.\"\n\nThe little man hesitated. Then he nodded.\n\n\"I'll give you six hundred,\" he agreed.\n\nMurmurs of discontent rose throughout the crowd. Harker climbed to the\nedge of the platform.\n\n\"We ain't to blame because they wouldn't fight,\" he shouted, \"but if\nthere's any of you small enough to want your money back you can git it\nas you go out. The dogs laid down on us, that's all. We ain't to blame.\"\n\nThe little man was edging his way between the chairs, accompanied by the\nsergeant of police. With his pale face close to the sapling bars of the\ncage he looked at Kazan and the big Dane.\n\n\"I guess we'll be good friends,\" he said, and he spoke so low that only\nthe dogs heard his voice. \"It's a big price, but we'll charge it to the\nSmithsonian, lads. I'm going to need a couple of four-footed friends of\nyour moral caliber.\"\n\nAnd no one knew why Kazan and the Dane drew nearer to the little\nscientist's side of the cage as he pulled out a big roll of bills and\ncounted out six hundred dollars for Harker and Sandy McTrigger.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nALONE IN DARKNESS\n\n\nNever had the terror and loneliness of blindness fallen upon Gray Wolf\nas in the days that followed the shooting of Kazan and his capture by\nSandy McTrigger. For hours after the shot she crouched in the bush back\nfrom the river, waiting for him to come to her. She had faith that he\nwould come, as he had come a thousand times before, and she lay close on\nher belly, sniffing the air, and whining when it brought no scent of her\nmate. Day and night were alike an endless chaos of darkness to her now,\nbut she knew when the sun went down. She sensed the first deepening\nshadows of evening, and she knew that the stars were out, and that the\nriver lay in moonlight. It was a night to roam, and after a time she\nmoved restlessly about in a small circle on the plain, and sent out her\nfirst inquiring call for Kazan. Up from the river came the pungent odor\nof smoke, and instinctively she knew that it was this smoke, and the\nnearness of man, that was keeping Kazan from her. But she went no nearer\nthan that first circle made by her padded feet. Blindness had taught her\nto wait. Since the day of the battle on the Sun Rock, when the lynx had\ndestroyed her eyes, Kazan had never failed her. Three times she called\nfor him in the early night. Then she made herself a nest under a\n_banskian_ shrub, and waited until dawn.\n\nJust how she knew when night blotted out the last glow of the sun, so\nwithout seeing she knew when day came. Not until she felt the warmth of\nthe sun on her back did her anxiety overcome her caution. Slowly she\nmoved toward the river, sniffing the air and whining. There was no\nlonger the smell of smoke in the air, and she could not catch the scent\nof man. She followed her own trail back to the sand-bar, and in the\nfringe of thick bush overhanging the white shore of the stream she\nstopped and listened. After a little she scrambled down and went\nstraight to the spot where she and Kazan were drinking when the shot\ncame. And there her nose struck the sand still wet and thick with\nKazan's blood. She knew it was the blood of her mate, for the scent of\nhim was all about her in the sand, mingled with the man-smell of Sandy\nMcTrigger. She sniffed the trail of his body to the edge of the stream,\nwhere Sandy had dragged him to the canoe. She found the fallen tree to\nwhich he had been tied. And then she came upon one of the two clubs that\nSandy had used to beat wounded Kazan into submissiveness. It was covered\nwith blood and hair, and all at once Gray Wolf lay back on her haunches\nand turned her blind face to the sky, and there rose from her throat a\ncry for Kazan that drifted for miles on the wings of the south wind.\nNever had Gray Wolf given quite that cry before. It was not the \"call\"\nthat comes with the moonlit nights, and neither was it the hunt-cry, nor\nthe she-wolf's yearning for matehood. It carried with it the lament of\ndeath. And after that one cry Gray Wolf slunk back to the fringe of bush\nover the river, and lay with her face turned to the stream.\n\nA strange terror fell upon her. She had grown accustomed to darkness,\nbut never before had she been _alone_ in that darkness. Always there\nhad been the guardianship of Kazan's presence. She heard the clucking\nsound of a spruce hen in the bush a few yards away, and now that sound\ncame to her as if from out of another world. A ground-mouse rustled\nthrough the grass close to her forepaws, and she snapped at it, and\nclosed her teeth on a rock. The muscles of her shoulders twitched\ntremulously and she shivered as if stricken by intense cold. She was\nterrified by the darkness that shut out the world from her, and she\npawed at her closed eyes, as if she might open them to light. Early in\nthe afternoon she wandered back on the plain. It was different. It\nfrightened her, and soon she returned to the beach, and snuggled down\nunder the tree where Kazan had lain. She was not so frightened here. The\nsmell of Kazan was strong about her. For an hour she lay motionless,\nwith her head resting on the club clotted with his hair and blood. Night\nfound her still there. And when the moon and the stars came out she\ncrawled back into the pit in the white sand that Kazan's body had made\nunder the tree.\n\nWith dawn she went down to the edge of the stream to drink. She could\nnot see that the day was almost as dark as night, and that the\ngray-black sky was a chaos of slumbering storm. But she could smell the\npresence of it in the thick air, and could _feel_ the forked flashes of\nlightning that rolled up with the dense pall from the south and west.\nThe distant rumbling of thunder grew louder, and she huddled herself\nagain under the tree. For hours the storm crashed over her, and the rain\nfell in a deluge. When it had finished she slunk out from her shelter\nlike a thing beaten. Vainly she sought for one last scent of Kazan. The\nclub was washed clean. Again the sand was white where Kazan's blood had\nreddened it. Even under the tree there was no sign of him left.\n\nUntil now only the terror of being alone in the pit of darkness that\nenveloped her had oppressed Gray Wolf. With afternoon came hunger. It\nwas this hunger that drew her from the sand-bar, and she wandered back\ninto the plain. A dozen times she scented game, and each time it evaded\nher. Even a ground-mouse that she cornered under a root, and dug out\nwith her paws, escaped her fangs.\n\nThirty-six hours before this Kazan and Gray Wolf had left a half of\ntheir last kill a mile of two farther back on the plain. The kill was\none of the big barren rabbits, and Gray Wolf turned in its direction.\nShe did not require sight to find it. In her was developed to its finest\npoint that sixth sense of the animal kingdom, the sense of orientation,\nand as straight as a pigeon might have winged its flight she cut through\nthe bush to the spot where they had cached the rabbit. A white fox had\nbeen there ahead of her, and she found only scattered bits of hair and\nfur. What the fox had left the moose-birds and bush-jays had carried\naway. Hungrily Gray Wolf turned back to the river.\n\nThat night she slept again where Kazan had lain, and three times she\ncalled for him without answer. A heavy dew fell, and it drenched the\nlast vestige of her mate's scent out of the sand. But still through the\nday that followed, and the day that followed that, blind Gray Wolf clung\nto the narrow rim of white sand. On the fourth day her hunger reached a\npoint where she gnawed the bark from willow bushes. It was on this day\nthat she made a discovery. She was drinking, when her sensitive nose\ntouched something in the water's edge that was smooth, and bore a faint\nodor of flesh. It was one of the big northern river clams. She pawed it\nashore, sniffing at the hard shell. Then she crunched it between her\nteeth. She had never tasted sweeter meat than that which she found\ninside, and she began hunting for other clams. She found many of them,\nand ate until she was no longer hungry. For three days more she remained\non the bar.\n\nAnd then, one night, the call came to her. It set her quivering with a\nstrange new excitement--something that may have been a new hope, and in\nthe moonlight she trotted nervously up and down the shining strip of\nsand, facing now the north, and now the south, and then the east and the\nwest--her head flung up, listening, as if in the soft wind of the night\nshe was trying to locate the whispering lure of a wonderful voice. And\nwhatever it was that came to her came from out of the south and east.\nOff there--across the barren, far beyond the outer edge of the northern\ntimber-line--was _home_. And off there, in her brute way, she reasoned\nthat she must find Kazan. The call did not come from their old windfall\nhome in the swamp. It came from beyond that, and in a flashing vision\nthere rose through her blindness a picture of the towering Sun Rock, of\nthe winding trail that led to it, and the cabin on the plain. It was\nthere that blindness had come to her. It was there that day had ended,\nand eternal night had begun. And it was there that she had mothered her\nfirst-born. Nature had registered these things so that they could never\nbe wiped out of her memory, and when the call came it was from the\nsunlit world where she had last known light and life and had last seen\nthe moon and the stars in the blue night of the skies.\n\nAnd to that call she responded, leaving the river and its food behind\nher--straight out into the face of darkness and starvation, no longer\nfearing death or the emptiness of the world she could not see; for ahead\nof her, two hundred miles away, she could see the Sun Rock, the winding\ntrail, the nest of her first-born between the two big rocks--_and\nKazan_!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nTHE LAST OF McTRIGGER\n\n\nSixty miles farther north Kazan lay at the end of his fine steel chain,\nwatching little Professor McGill mixing a pail of tallow and bran. A\ndozen yards from him lay the big Dane, his huge jaws drooling in\nanticipation of the unusual feast which McGill was preparing. He showed\nsigns of pleasure when McGill approached him with a quart of the\nmixture, and he gulped it between his huge jaws. The little man with the\ncold blue eyes and the gray-blond hair stroked his back without fear.\nHis attitude was different when he turned to Kazan. His movements were\nfilled with caution, and yet his eyes and his lips were smiling, and he\ngave the wolf-dog no evidence of his fear, if it could be called fear.\n\nThe little professor, who was up in the north country for the\nSmithsonian Institution, had spent a third of his life among dogs. He\nloved them, and understood them. He had written a number of magazine\narticles on dog intellect that had attracted wide attention among\nnaturalists. It was largely because he loved dogs, and understood them\nmore than most men, that he had bought Kazan and the big Dane on the\nnight when Sandy McTrigger and his partner had tried to get them to\nfight to the death in the Red Gold City saloon. The refusal of the two\nsplendid beasts to kill each other for the pleasure of the three hundred\nmen who had assembled to witness the fight delighted him. He had already\nplanned a paper on the incident. Sandy had told him the story of Kazan's\ncapture, and of his wild mate, Gray Wolf, and the professor had asked\nhim a thousand questions. But each day Kazan puzzled him more. No amount\nof kindness on his part could bring a responsive gleam in Kazan's eyes.\nNot once did Kazan signify a willingness to become friends. And yet he\ndid not snarl at McGill, or snap at his hands when they came within\nreach. Quite frequently Sandy McTrigger came over to the little cabin\nwhere McGill was staying, and three times Kazan leaped at the end of\nhis chain to get at him, and his white fangs gleamed as long as Sandy\nwas in sight. Alone with McGill he became quiet. Something told him that\nMcGill had come as a friend that night when he and the big Dane stood\nshoulder to shoulder in the cage that had been built for a slaughter\npen. Away down in his brute heart he held McGill apart from other men.\nHe had no desire to harm him. He tolerated him, but showed none of the\ngrowing affection of the huge Dane. It was this fact that puzzled\nMcGill. He had never before known a dog that he could not make love him.\n\nTo-day he placed the tallow and bran before Kazan, and the smile in his\nface gave way to a look of perplexity. Kazan's lips had drawn suddenly\nback. A fierce snarl rolled deep in his throat. The hair along his spine\nstood up. His muscles twitched. Instinctively the professor turned.\nSandy McTrigger had come up quietly behind him. His brutal face wore a\ngrin as he looked at Kazan.\n\n\"It's a fool job--tryin' to make friends with _him_\" he said. Then he\nadded, with a sudden interested gleam in his eyes, \"When you startin'?\"\n\n\"With first frost,\" replied McGill. \"It ought to come soon. I'm going to\njoin Sergeant Conroy and his party at Fond du Lac by the first of\nOctober.\"\n\n\"And you're going up to Fond du Lac--alone?\" queried Sandy. \"Why don't\nyou take a man?\"\n\nThe little professor laughed softly.\n\n\"Why?\" he asked. \"I've been through the Athabasca waterways a dozen\ntimes, and know the trail as well as I know Broadway. Besides, I like to\nbe alone. And the work isn't too hard, with the currents all flowing to\nthe north and east.\"\n\nSandy was looking at the Dane, with his back to McGill. An exultant\ngleam shot for an instant into his eyes.\n\n\"You're taking the dogs?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nSandy lighted his pipe, and spoke like one strangely curious.\n\n\"Must cost a heap to take these trips o' yourn, don't it?\"\n\n\"My last cost about seven thousand dollars. This will cost five,\" said\nMcGill.\n\n\"Gawd!\" breathed Sandy. \"An' you carry all that along with you! Ain't\nyou afraid--something might happen--?\"\n\nThe little professor was looking the other way now. The carelessness in\nhis face and manner changed. His blue eyes grew a shade darker. A hard\nsmile which Sandy did not see hovered about his lips for an instant.\nThen he turned, laughing.\n\n\"I'm a very light sleeper,\" he said. \"A footstep at night rouses me.\nEven a man's breathing awakes me, when I make up my mind that I must be\non my guard. And, besides\"--he drew from his pocket a blue-steeled\nSavage automatic--\"I know how to use _this_.\" He pointed to a knot in\nthe wall of the cabin. \"Observe,\" he said. Five times he fired at twenty\npaces, and when Sandy went up to look at the knot he gave a gasp. There\nwas one jagged hole where the knot had been.\n\n\"Pretty good,\" he grinned. \"Most men couldn't do better'n that with a\nrifle.\"\n\nWhen Sandy left, McGill followed him with a suspicious gleam in his\neyes, and a curious smile on his lips. Then he turned to Kazan.\n\n\"Guess you've got him figgered out about right, old man,\" he laughed\nsoftly. \"I don't blame you very much for wanting to get him by the\nthroat. Perhaps--\"\n\nHe shoved his hands deep in his pockets, and went into the cabin. Kazan\ndropped his head between his forepaws, and lay still, with wide-open\neyes. It was late afternoon, early in September, and each night brought\nnow the first chill breaths of autumn. Kazan watched the last glow of\nthe sun as it faded out of the southern skies. Darkness always followed\nswiftly after that, and with darkness came more fiercely his wild\nlonging for freedom. Night after night he had gnawed at his steel chain.\nNight after night he had watched the stars, and the moon, and had\nlistened for Gray Wolf's call, while the big Dane lay sleeping. To-night\nit was colder than usual, and the keen tang of the wind that came fresh\nfrom the west stirred him strangely. It set his blood afire with what\nthe Indians call the Frost Hunger. Lethargic summer was gone and the\ndays and nights of hunting were at hand. He wanted to leap out into\nfreedom and run until he was exhausted, with Gray Wolf at his side. He\nknew that Gray Wolf was off there--where the stars hung low in the clear\nsky, and that she was waiting. He strained at the end of his chain, and\nwhined. All that night he was restless--more restless than he had been\nat any time before. Once, in the far distance, he heard a cry that he\nthought was the cry of Gray Wolf, and his answer roused McGill from deep\nsleep. It was dawn, and the little professor dressed himself and came\nout of the cabin. With satisfaction he noted the exhilarating snap in\nthe air. He wet his fingers and held them above his head, chuckling when\nhe found the wind had swung into the north. He went to Kazan, and talked\nto him. Among other things he said, \"This'll put the black flies to\nsleep, Kazan. A day or two more of it and we'll start.\"\n\nFive days later McGill led first the Dane, and then Kazan, to a packed\ncanoe. Sandy McTrigger saw them off, and Kazan watched for a chance to\nleap at him. Sandy kept his distance, and McGill watched the two with a\nthought that set the blood running swiftly behind the mask of his\ncareless smile. They had slipped a mile down-stream when he leaned over\nand laid a fearless hand on Kazan's head. Something in the touch of that\nhand, and in the professor's voice, kept Kazan from a desire to snap at\nhim. He tolerated the friendship with expressionless eyes and a\nmotionless body.\n\n\"I was beginning to fear I wouldn't have much sleep, old boy,\" chuckled\nMcGill ambiguously, \"but I guess I can take a nap now and then with\n_you_ along!\"\n\nHe made camp that night fifteen miles up the lake shore. The big Dane he\nfastened to a sapling twenty yards from his small silk tent, but Kazan's\nchain he made fast to the butt of a stunted birch that held down the\ntent-flap. Before he went into the tent for the night McGill pulled out\nhis automatic and examined it with care.\n\nFor three days the journey continued without a mishap along the shore of\nLake Athabasca. On the fourth night McGill pitched his tent in a clump\nof _banskian_ pine a hundred yards back from the water. All that day the\nwind had come steadily from behind them, and for at least a half of the\nday the professor had been watching Kazan closely. From the west there\nhad now and then come a scent that stirred him uneasily. Since noon he\nhad sniffed that wind. Twice McGill had heard him growling deep in his\nthroat, and once, when the scent had come stronger than usual, he had\nbared his fangs, and the bristles stood up along his spine. For an hour\nafter striking camp the little professor did not build a fire, but sat\nlooking up the shore of the lake through his hunting glass. It was dusk\nwhen he returned to where he had put up his tent and chained the dogs.\nFor a few moments he stood unobserved, looking at the wolf-dog. Kazan\nwas still uneasy. He lay _facing_ the west. McGill made note of this,\nfor the big Dane lay behind Kazan--to the east. Under ordinary\nconditions Kazan would have faced him. He was sure now that there was\nsomething in the west wind. A little shiver ran up his back as he\nthought of what it might be.\n\nBehind a rock he built a very small fire, and prepared supper. After\nthis he went into the tent, and when he came out he carried a blanket\nunder his arm. He chuckled as he stood for a moment over Kazan.\n\n\"We're not going to sleep in there to-night, old hoy,\" he said. \"I don't\nlike what you've found in the west wind. It may he a--_thunder-storm!_\"\nHe laughed at his joke, and buried himself in a clump of stunted\n_banskians_ thirty paces from the tent. Here he rolled himself in his\nblanket, and went to sleep.\n\nIt was a quiet starlit night, and hours afterward Kazan dropped his nose\nbetween his forepaws and drowsed. It was the snap of a twig that roused\nhim. The sound did not awaken the sluggish Dane but instantly Kazan's\nhead was alert, his keen nostrils sniffing the air. What he had smelled\nall day was heavy about him now. He lay still and quivering. Slowly,\nfrom out of the _banskians_ behind the tent, there came a figure. It was\nnot the little professor. It approached cautiously, with lowered head\nand hunched shoulders, and the starlight revealed the murderous face of\nSandy McTrigger. Kazan crouched low. He laid his head flat between his\nforepaws. His long fangs gleamed. But he made no sound that betrayed his\nconcealment under a thick _banskian_ shrub. Step by step Sandy\napproached, and at last he reached the flap of the tent. He did not\ncarry a club or a whip in his hand now. In the place of either of those\nwas the glitter of steel. At the door to the tent he paused, and peered\nin, his back to Kazan.\n\nSilently, swiftly--the wolf now in every movement, Kazan came to his\nfeet. He forgot the chain that held him. Ten feet away stood the enemy\nhe hated above all others he had ever known. Every ounce of strength in\nhis splendid body gathered itself for the spring. And then he leaped.\nThis time the chain did not pull him back, almost neck-broken. Age and\nthe elements had weakened the leather collar he had worn since the days\nof his slavery in the traces, and it gave way with a snap. Sandy turned,\nand in a second leap Kazan's fangs sank into the flesh of his arm. With\na startled cry the man fell, and as they rolled over on the ground the\nbig Dane's deep voice rolled out in thunderous alarm as he tugged at his\nleash. In the fall Kazan's hold was broken. In an instant he was on his\nfeet, ready for another attack. And then the change came. He was\n_free_. The collar was gone from his neck. The forest, the stars, the\nwhispering wind were all about him. _Here_ were men, and off there\nwas--Gray Wolf! His ears dropped, and he turned swiftly, and slipped\nlike a shadow back into the glorious freedom of his world.\n\nA hundred yards away something stopped him for an instant. It was not\nthe big Dane's voice, but the sharp _crack--crack--crack_, of the little\nprofessor's automatic. And above that sound there rose the voice of\nSandy McTrigger in a weird and terrible cry.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\nAN EMPTY WORLD\n\n\nMile after mile Kazan went on. For a time he was oppressed by the\nshivering note of death that had come to him in Sandy McTrigger's cry,\nand he slipped through the _banskians_ like a shadow, his ears\nflattened, his tail trailing, his hindquarters betraying that curious\nslinking quality of the wolf and dog stealing away from danger. Then he\ncame out upon a plain, and the stillness, the billion stars in the clear\nvault of the sky, and the keen air that carried with it a breath of the\nArctic barrens made him alert and questioning. He faced the direction of\nthe wind. Somewhere off there, far to the south and west, was Gray Wolf.\nFor the first time in many weeks he sat back on his haunches and gave\nthe deep and vibrant call that echoed weirdly for miles about him. Back\nin the _banskians_ the big Dane heard it, and whined. From over the\nstill body of Sandy McTrigger the little professor looked up with a\nwhite tense face, and listened for a second cry. But instinct told Kazan\nthat to that first call there would be no answer, and now he struck out\nswiftly, galloping mile after mile, as a dog follows the trail of its\nmaster home. He did not turn hack to the lake, nor was his direction\ntoward Red Gold City. As straight as he might have followed a road\nblazed by the hand of man he cut across the forty miles of plain and\nswamp and forest and rocky ridge that lay between him and the McFarlane.\nAll that night he did not call again for Gray Wolf. With him reasoning\nwas a process brought about by habit--by precedent--and as Gray Wolf had\nwaited for him many times before he knew that she would be waiting for\nhim now near the sand-bar.\n\nBy dawn he had reached the river, within three miles of the sand-bar.\nScarcely was the sun up when he stood on the white strip of sand where\nhe and Gray Wolf had come down to drink. Expectantly and confidently he\nlooked about him for Gray Wolf, whining softly, and wagging his tail. He\nbegan to search for her scent, but rains had washed even her footprints\nfrom the clean sand. All that day he searched for her along the river\nand out on the plain. He went to where they had killed their last\nrabbit. He sniffed at the bushes where the poison baits had hung. Again\nand again he sat back on his haunches and sent out his mating cry to\nher. And slowly, as he did these things, nature was working in him that\nmiracle of the wild which the Crees have named the \"spirit call.\" As it\nhad worked in Gray Wolf, so now it stirred the blood of Kazan. With the\ngoing of the sun, and the sweeping about him of shadowy night, he turned\nmore and more to the south and east. His whole world was made up of the\ntrails over which he had hunted. Beyond those places he did not know\nthat there was such a thing as existence. And in that world, small in\nhis understanding of things, was Gray Wolf. He could not miss her. That\nworld, in his comprehension of it, ran from the McFarlane in a narrow\ntrail through the forests and over the plains to the little valley from\nwhich the beavers had driven them. If Gray Wolf was not here--she was\nthere, and tirelessly he resumed his quest of her.\n\nNot until the stars were fading out of the sky again, and gray day was\ngiving place to night, did exhaustion and hunger stop him. He killed a\nrabbit, and for hours after he had feasted he lay close to his kill, and\nslept. Then he went on.\n\nThe fourth night he came to the little valley between the two ridges,\nand under the stars, more brilliant now in the chill clearness of the\nearly autumn nights, he followed the creek down into their old swamp\nhome. It was broad day when he reached the edge of the great beaver pond\nthat now completely surrounded the windfall under which Gray-Wolf's\nsecond-born had come into the world. Broken Tooth and the other beavers\nhad wrought a big change in what had once been his home and Gray Wolf's,\nand for many minutes Kazan stood silent and motionless at the edge of\nthe pond, sniffing the air heavy with the unpleasant odor of the\nusurpers. Until now his spirit had remained unbroken. Footsore, with\nthinned sides and gaunt head, he circled slowly through the swamp. All\nthat day he searched. And his crest lay flat now, and there was a hunted\nlook in the droop of his shoulders and in the shifting look of his\neyes. Gray Wolf was gone.\n\nSlowly nature was impinging that fact upon him. She had passed out of\nhis world and out of his life, and he was filled with a loneliness and a\ngrief so great that the forest seemed strange, and the stillness of the\nwild a thing that now oppressed and frightened him. Once more the dog in\nhim was mastering the wolf. With Gray Wolf he had possessed the world of\nfreedom. Without her, that world was so big and strange and empty that\nit appalled him. Late in the afternoon he came upon a little pile of\ncrushed clamshells on the shore of the stream. He sniffed at\nthem--turned away--went back, and sniffed again. It was where Gray Wolf\nhad made a last feast in the swamp before continuing south. But the\nscent she had left behind was not strong enough to tell Kazan, and for a\nsecond time he turned away. That night he slunk under a log, and cried\nhimself to sleep. Deep in the night he grieved in his uneasy slumber,\nlike a child. And day after day, and night after night, Kazan remained a\nslinking creature of the big swamp, mourning for the one creature that\nhad brought him out of chaos into light, who had filled his world for\nhim, and who, in going from him, had taken from this world even the\nthings that Gray Wolf had lost in her blindness.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\nTHE CALL OF SUN ROCK\n\n\nIn the golden glow of the autumn sun there came up the stream overlooked\nby the Sun Rock one day a man, a woman and a child in a canoe.\nCivilization had done for lovely Joan what it had done for many another\nwild flower transplanted from the depths of the wilderness. Her cheeks\nwere thin. Her blue eyes had lost their luster. She coughed, and when\nshe coughed the man looked at her with love and fear in his eyes. But\nnow, slowly, the man had begun to see the transformation, and on the day\ntheir canoe pointed up the stream and into the wonderful valley that had\nbeen their home before the call of the distant city came to them, he\nnoted the flush gathering once more in her cheeks, the fuller redness of\nher lips, and the gathering glow of happiness and content in her eyes.\nHe laughed softly as he saw these things, and he blessed the forests. In\nthe canoe she had leaned back, with her head almost against his\nshoulder, and he stopped paddling to draw her to him, and run his\nfingers through the soft golden masses of her hair.\n\n\"You are happy again, Joan,\" he laughed joyously. \"The doctors were\nright. You are a part of the forests.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am happy,\" she whispered, and suddenly there came a little\nthrill into her voice, and she pointed to a white finger of sand running\nout into the stream. \"Do you remember--years and years ago, it\nseems--that Kazan left us here? _She_ was on the sand over there,\ncalling to him. Do you remember?\" There was a little tremble about her\nmouth, and she added, \"I wonder--where they--have gone.\"\n\nThe cabin was as they had left it. Only the crimson _bakneesh_ had grown\nup about it, and shrubs and tall grass had sprung up near its walls.\nOnce more it took on life, and day by day the color came deeper into\nJoan's cheeks, and her voice was filled with its old wild sweetness of\nsong. Joan's husband cleared the trails over his old trap-lines, and\nJoan and the little Joan, who romped and talked now, transformed the\ncabin into _home_. One night the man returned to the cabin late, and\nwhen he came in there was a glow of excitement in Joan's blue eyes, and\na tremble in her voice when she greeted him.\n\n\"Did you hear it?\" she asked. \"Did you hear--_the call_?\"\n\nHe nodded, stroking her soft hair.\n\n\"I was a mile back in the creek swamp,\" he said. \"I heard it!\"\n\nJoan's hands clutched his arms.\n\n\"It wasn't Kazan,\" she said. \"I would recognize _his_ voice. But it\nseemed to me it was like the other--the call that came that morning from\nthe sand-bar, his _mate_?\"\n\nThe man was thinking. Joan's fingers tightened. She was breathing a\nlittle quickly.\n\n\"Will you promise me this?\" she asked, \"Will you promise me that you\nwill never hunt or trap for wolves?\"\n\n\"I had thought of that,\" he replied. \"I thought of it--after I heard the\ncall. Yes, I will promise.\"\n\nJoan's arms stole up about his neck.\n\n\"We loved Kazan,\" she whispered. \"And you might kill him--or _her_\"\n\nSuddenly she stopped. Both listened. The door was a little ajar, and to\nthem there came again the wailing mate-call of the wolf. Joan ran to the\ndoor. Her husband followed. Together they stood silent, and with tense\nbreath Joan pointed over the starlit plain.\n\n\"Listen! Listen!\" she commanded. \"It's her cry, _and it came from the\nSun Rock_!\"\n\nShe ran out into the night, forgetting that the man was close behind her\nnow, forgetting that little Joan was alone in her bed. And to them, from\nmiles and miles across the plain, there came a wailing cry in answer--a\ncry that seemed a part of the wind, and that thrilled Joan until her\nbreath broke in a strange sob.\n\nFarther out on the plain she went and then stopped, with the golden glow\nof the autumn moon and the stars shimmering in her hair and eyes. It was\nmany minutes before the cry came again, and then it was so near that\nJoan put her hands to her mouth, and her cry rang out over the plain as\nin the days of old.\n\n\"_Kazan! Kazan! Kazan_!\"\n\nAt the top of the Sun Rock, Gray Wolf--gaunt and thinned by\nstarvation--heard the woman's cry, and the call that was in her throat\ndied away in a whine. And to the north a swiftly moving shadow stopped\nfor a moment, and stood like a thing of rock under the starlight. It was\nKazan. A strange fire leaped through his body. Every fiber of his brute\nunderstanding was afire with the knowledge that here was _home_. It was\nhere, long ago, that he had lived, and loved, and fought--and all at\nonce the dreams that had grown faded and indistinct in his memory came\nback to him as real living things. For, coming to him faintly over the\nplain, _he heard Joan's voice!_\n\nIn the starlight Joan stood, tense and white, when from out of the pale\nmists of the moon-glow he came to her, cringing on his belly, panting\nand wind-run, and with a strange whining note in his throat. And as Joan\nwent to him, her arms reaching out, her lips sobbing his name over and\nover again, the man stood and looked down upon them with the wonder of a\nnew and greater understanding in his face. He had no fear of the\nwolf-dog now. And as Joan's arms hugged Kazan's great shaggy head up to\nher he heard the whining gasping joy of the beast and the sobbing\nwhispering voice of the girl, and with tensely gripped hands he faced\nthe Sun Rock.\n\n\"My Gawd,\" he breathed. \"I believe--it's so--\"\n\nAs if in response to the thought in his mind, there came once more\nacross the plain Gray Wolf's mate-seeking cry of grief and of\nloneliness. Swiftly as though struck by a lash Kazan was on his\nfeet--oblivious of Joan's touch, of her voice, of the presence of the\nman. In another instant he was gone, and Joan flung herself against her\nhusband's breast, and almost fiercely took his face between her two\nhands.\n\n\"_Now_ do you believe?\" she cried pantingly. \"_Now_ do you believe in\nthe God of my world--the God I have lived with, the God that gives souls\nto the wild things, the God that--that has brought--us,\nall--together--once more--_home_!\"\n\nHis arms closed gently about her.\n\n\"I believe, my Joan,\" he whispered.\n\n\"And you understand--now--what it means, 'Thou shalt not kill'?\"\n\n\"Except that it brings us life--yes, I understand,\" he replied.\n\nHer warm soft hands stroked his face. Her blue eyes, filled with the\nglory of the stars, looked up into his.\n\n\"Kazan and _she_--you and I--and the baby! Are you sorry--that we came\nback?\" she asked.\n\nSo close he drew her against his breast that she did not hear the words\nhe whispered in the soft warmth of her hair. And after that, for many\nhours, they sat in the starlight in front of the cabin door. But they\ndid not hear again that lonely cry from the Sun Rock. Joan and her\nhusband understood.\n\n\"He'll visit us again to-morrow,\" the man said at last. \"Come, Joan, let\nus go to bed.\"\n\nTogether they entered the cabin.\n\nAnd that night, side by side, Kazan and Gray Wolf hunted again in the\nmoonlit plain.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Kazan, by James Oliver Curwood\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK KAZAN ***\n\n***** This file should be named 10084-8.txt or 10084-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/1\/0\/0\/8\/10084\/\n\nProduced by Kevin Handy, Dave Maddock, and the Online Distributed\nProofreading Team.\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\n\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\ndownload by the etext year.\n\n     http:\/\/www.ibiblio.org\/gutenberg\/etext06\n\n    (Or \/etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\n\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/1\/0\/2\/3\/10234\n\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/2\/4\/6\/8\/24689\n\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/GUTINDEX.ALL\n\n","id":822,"split":"train"}
