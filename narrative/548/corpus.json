{"ori_id":"81e6f3041809c7dae5dc12e09201477945ae9077","title":"The Son of the Sun","context":"The Son of the Sun\n The opening panels of the story are set in the Duckburg museum, where Scrooge McDuck is opening a museum exhibit featuring the greatest wonders he has collected during his travels around the world (most of them direct tributes to classic Barks stories).\nAs Scrooge is bragging to his nephews, Donald Duck and Huey, Dewey and Louie (who all familiar with the artifacts, having taken part in the expeditions for them), Flintheart Glomgold, who is about to open his own exhibit, overhears Scrooge and the conversation between the two rivals turns into a bragging match as to who is the greatest adventurer and treasure-seeker. Scrooge challenges Glomgold to think of something he could find; Glomgold is momentarily nonplussed, then catches sight of Scrooge\u2019s exhibit of Inca artifacts and points out that while Scrooge found the original gold mines of the Incas, he never found the golden artifacts that had been extracted from the mines. Soon Scrooge and his nephews are off on a race with Glomgold to see who can find, and claim the \"greater Incan treasure\".\nThe first clue comes as soon as Glomgold has left, as Donald picks up an Incan vase that was knocked over during the bragging match. They find a metal plaque baked inside, providing a map to a temple of Manco Capac in the Andes mountains. Unfortunately, Glomgold is eavesdropping.\nArriving at a village near Cuzco, Scrooge hires a plane to fly them to its location. The pilot of the plane turns out to be Glomgold, who relieves them of the plaque at gunpoint and then parachutes out. Scrooge tries to regain control of the plane and, in a comic episode, inadvertently rips out the belly of the plane while flying too low, dumping his nephews onto the valley floor, still in their seats. As the plane flies off, Glomgold approaches and informs the ducks that Scrooge has frightened away the porters he hired, so they will have to do.\nA week later, Glomgold and his reluctant helpers reach a remote mountain, on the summit of which is the temple, built around a large volcanic fumarole (hence, the plaque\u2019s description, the \"life breath\" of Manco Capac). Glomgold enters the temple\u2019s treasure chamber and is beside himself with glee to discover an enormous store of golden Inca artifacts. Then Scrooge appears, calmly informing Glomgold that he crash-landed the plane on the mountaintop several days ago, and has already filed his claim on the gold using the plane\u2019s radio.\nIt seems the Scrooge has won, but Huey, Dewey, and Louie are confused about one thing: the plaque makes reference to an Incan \"treasure\" being moved to the temple, but it actually predates the time of the conquistadors, which is naturally when the gold would have been moved there. Realising there must be another Incan treasure in the temple, Glomgold investigates further and discovers the \"Eye\" of Manco Capac: an enormous, disc-shaped sunburst festooned with enormous gemstones. Since Scrooge claimed the gold, and not the temple, and there\u2019s no gold on the sunburst, that makes it Glomgold\u2019s.\nAs Scrooge and Glomgold begin to argue about whose treasure is of greater value, Glomgold begins taking it down from its wall mounting, but it falls and rolls down the temple steps and into the fumarole. It wedges into the hole convex side down, creating a perfect seal. As the volcanic gases build up an enormous pressure, Scrooge notices that the back of the sunburst is sheathed in gold, starting another furious argument between him and Glomgold, and causing them to wedge the sunburst down even more firmly. Before the others can stop them, the pressure mounts and the entire mountaintop, temple and all, is suddenly blown into the sky like a cork from a bottle. The ducks are able to use a tapestry as a makeshift parachute before the temple lands squarely in a nearly bottomless volcanic lake, next to the village they originally started from. The massive splash of water irrigates the villagers\u2019 crop fields, relieving them from the effects of recent drought.\nAll of the treasure is now completely irretrievable. As the dispirited ducks begin their journey back to civilisation, Scrooge is seen emerging from the village and mentions that he has agreed to build a pumping station for the village so that they will never be troubled by drought again. Glomgold scorns Scrooge's generosity, until Scrooge reveals that in return, the villagers have agreed to sell him the lake for one peso \u2014 which makes Scrooge the rightful owner of both the temple and all of the treasure inside it. Even though he cannot retrieve it, Scrooge is now the clear legal owner of all of the treasure \u2014 and thus the winner of the contest.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of A Son Of The Sun, by Jack London\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

From the latter came the low murmur of a lazy surf, but the\nsheltered stretch of water, not more than a hundred yards across to the\nwhite beach of pounded coral sand, was of glass-like smoothness. Narrow\nas was the passage, and anchored as she was in the shoalest place that\ngave room to swing, the _Willi-Waw's_ chain rode up-and-down a clean\nhundred feet. Its course could be traced over the bottom of living\ncoral. Like some monstrous snake, the rusty chain's slack wandered\nover the ocean floor, crossing and recrossing itself several times and\nfetching up finally at the idle anchor. Big rock-cod, dun and mottled,\nplayed warily in and out of the coral. Other fish, grotesque of form and\ncolour, were brazenly indifferent, even when a big fish-shark drifted\nsluggishly along and sent the rock-cod scuttling for their favourite\ncrevices.\n\nOn deck, for'ard, a dozen blacks pottered clumsily at scraping the teak\nrail. They were as inexpert at their work as so many monkeys. In fact\nthey looked very much like monkeys of some enlarged and prehistoric\ntype. Their eyes had in them the querulous plaintiveness of the monkey,\ntheir faces were even less symmetrical than the monkey's, and, hairless\nof body, they were far more ungarmented than any monkey, for clothes\nthey had none. Decorated they were as no monkey ever was. In holes in\ntheir ears they carried short clay pipes, rings of turtle shell, huge\nplugs of wood, rusty wire nails, and empty rifle cartridges. The calibre\nof a Winchester rifle was the smallest hole an ear bore; some of the\nlargest holes were inches in diameter, and any single ear averaged from\nthree to half a dozen holes. Spikes and bodkins of polished bone or\npetrified shell were thrust through their noses. On the chest of one\nhung a white doorknob, on the chest of another the handle of a china\ncup, on the chest of a third the brass cogwheel of an alarm clock. They\nchattered in queer, falsetto voices, and, combined, did no more work\nthan a single white sailor.\n\nAft, under an awning, were two white men. Each was clad in a six-penny\nundershirt and wrapped about the loins with a strip of cloth. Belted\nabout the middle of each was a revolver and tobacco pouch. The sweat\nstood out on their skin in myriads of globules. Here and there the\nglobules coalesced in tiny streams that dripped to the heated deck and\nalmost immediately evaporated. The lean, dark-eyed man wiped his fingers\nwet with a stinging stream from his forehead and flung it from him with\na weary curse. Wearily, and without hope, he gazed seaward across the\nouter-reef, and at the tops of the palms along the beach.\n\n\"Eight o'clock, an' hell don't get hot till noon,\" he complained. \"Wisht\nto God for a breeze. Ain't we never goin' to get away?\"\n\nThe other man, a slender German of five and twenty, with the massive\nforehead of a scholar and the tumble-home chin of a degenerate, did not\ntrouble to reply. He was busy emptying powdered quinine into a cigarette\npaper. Rolling what was approximately fifty grains of the drug into a\ntight wad, he tossed it into his mouth and gulped it down without the\naid of water.\n\n\"Wisht I had some whiskey,\" the first man panted, after a fifteen-minute\ninterval of silence.\n\nAnother equal period elapsed ere the German enounced, relevant of\nnothing:\n\n\"I'm rotten with fever. I'm going to quit you, Griffiths, when we get to\nSydney. No more tropics for me. I ought to known better when I signed on\nwith you.\"\n\n\"You ain't been much of a mate,\" Griffiths replied, too hot himself to\nspeak heatedly. \"When the beach at Guvutu heard I'd shipped you, they\nall laughed. 'What? Jacobsen?' they said. 'You can't hide a square\nface of trade gin or sulphuric acid that he won't smell out!' You've\ncertainly lived up to your reputation. I ain't had a drink for a\nfortnight, what of your snoopin' my supply.\"\n\n\"If the fever was as rotten in you as me, you'd understand,\" the mate\nwhimpered.\n\n\"I ain't kickin',\" Griffiths answered. \"I only wisht God'd send me a\ndrink, or a breeze of wind, or something. I'm ripe for my next chill\nto-morrow.\"\n\nThe mate proffered him the quinine. Rolling a fifty-grain dose, he\npopped the wad into his mouth and swallowed it dry.\n\n\"God! God!\" he moaned. \"I dream of a land somewheres where they ain't no\nquinine. Damned stuff of hell! I've scoffed tons of it in my time.\"\n\nAgain he quested seaward for signs of wind. The usual trade-wind clouds\nwere absent, and the sun, still low in its climb to meridian, turned all\nthe sky to heated brass. One seemed to see as well as feel this heat,\nand Griffiths sought vain relief by gazing shoreward. The white beach\nwas a searing ache to his eyeballs. The palm trees, absolutely still,\noutlined flatly against the unrefreshing green of the packed jungle,\nseemed so much cardboard scenery. The little black boys, playing\nnaked in the dazzle of sand and sun, were an affront and a hurt to the\nsun-sick man. He felt a sort of relief when one, running, tripped and\nfell on all-fours in the tepid sea-water.\n\nAn exclamation from the blacks for'ard sent both men glancing seaward.\nAround the near point of land, a quarter of a mile away and skirting the\nreef, a long black canoe paddled into sight.\n\n\"Gooma boys from the next bight,\" was the mate's verdict.\n\nOne of the blacks came aft, treading the hot deck with the unconcern of\none whose bare feet felt no heat. This, too, was a hurt to Griffiths,\nand he closed his eyes. But the next moment they were open wide.\n\n\"White fella marster stop along Gooma boy,\" the black said.\n\nBoth men were on their feet and gazing at the canoe. Aft could be seen\nthe unmistakable sombrero of a white man. Quick alarm showed itself on\nthe face of the mate.\n\n\"It's Grief,\" he said.\n\nGriffiths satisfied himself by a long look, then ripped out a wrathful\noath.\n\n\"What's he doing up here?\" he demanded of the mate, of the aching sea\nand sky, of the merciless blaze of sun, and of the whole superheated and\nimplacable universe with which his fate was entangled.\n\nThe mate began to chuckle.\n\n\"I told you you couldn't get away with it,\" he said.\n\nBut Griffiths was not listening.\n\n\"With all his money, coming around like a rent collector,\" he chanted\nhis outrage, almost in an ecstasy of anger. \"He's loaded with money,\nhe's stuffed with money, he's busting with money. I know for a fact he\nsold his Yringa plantations for three hundred thousand pounds. Bell\ntold me so himself last time we were drunk at Guvutu. Worth millions and\nmillions, and Shylocking me for what he wouldn't light his pipe with.\"\nHe whirled on the mate. \"Of course you told me so. Go on and say it, and\nkeep on saying it. Now just what was it you did tell me so?\"\n\n\"I told you you didn't know him, if you thought you could clear the\nSolomons without paying him. That man Grief is a devil, but he's\nstraight. I know. I told you he'd throw a thousand quid away for the fun\nof it, and for sixpence fight like a shark for a rusty tin, I tell you I\nknow. Didn't he give his _Balakula_ to the Queensland Mission when they\nlost their _Evening Star_ on San Cristobal?--and the _Balakula_ worth\nthree thousand pounds if she was worth a penny? And didn't he beat up\nStrothers till he lay abed a fortnight, all because of a difference of\ntwo pound ten in the account, and because Strothers got fresh and tried\nto make the gouge go through?\"\n\n\"God strike me blind!\" Griffiths cried in im-potency of rage.\n\nThe mate went on with his exposition.\n\n\"I tell you only a straight man can buck a straight man like him, and\nthe man's never hit the Solomons that could do it. Men like you and me\ncan't buck him. We're too rotten, too rotten all the way through. You've\ngot plenty more than twelve hundred quid below. Pay him, and get it over\nwith.\"\n\nBut Griffiths gritted his teeth and drew his thin lips tightly across\nthem.\n\n\"I'll buck him,\" he muttered--more to himself and the brazen ball of sun\nthan to the mate. He turned and half started to go below, then turned\nback again. \"Look here, Jacob-sen. He won't be here for quarter of an\nhour. Are you with me? Will you stand by me?\"\n\n\"Of course I'll stand by you. I've drunk all your whiskey, haven't I?\nWhat are you going to do?\"\n\n\"I'm not going to kill him if I can help it. But I'm not going to pay.\nTake that flat.\"\n\nJacobsen shrugged his shoulders in calm acquiescence to fate, and\nGriffiths stepped to the companionway and went below.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nJacobsen watched the canoe across the low reef as it came abreast and\npassed on to the entrance of the passage. Griffiths, with ink-marks on\nright thumb and forefinger, returned on deck Fifteen minutes later the\ncanoe came alongside. The man with the sombrero stood up.\n\n\"Hello, Griffiths!\" he said. \"Hello, Jacobsen!\" With his hand on the\nrail he turned to his dusky crew. \"You fella boy stop along canoe\naltogether.\"\n\nAs he swung over the rail and stepped on deck a hint of catlike\nlitheness showed in the apparently heavy body. Like the other two, he\nwas scantily clad. The cheap undershirt and white loin-cloth did not\nserve to hide the well put up body. Heavy muscled he was, but he was\nnot lumped and hummocked by muscles. They were softly rounded, and, when\nthey did move, slid softly and silkily under the smooth, tanned skin.\nArdent suns had likewise tanned his face till it was swarthy as a\nSpaniard's. The yellow mustache appeared incongruous in the midst of\nsuch swarthiness, while the clear blue of the eyes produced a feeling of\nshock on the beholder. It was difficult to realize that the skin of this\nman had once been fair.\n\n\"Where did you blow in from?\" Griffiths asked, as they shook hands. \"I\nthought you were over in the Santa Cruz.\"\n\n\"I was,\" the newcomer answered. \"But we made a quick passage. The\n_Wonder's_ just around in the bight at Gooma, waiting for wind. Some\nof the bushmen reported a ketch here, and I just dropped around to see.\nWell, how goes it?\"\n\n\"Nothing much. Copra sheds mostly empty, and not half a dozen tons of\nivory nuts. The women all got rotten with fever and quit, and the men\ncan't chase them back into the swamps. They're a sick crowd. I'd ask you\nto have a drink, but the mate finished off my last bottle. I wisht to\nGod for a breeze of wind.\"\n\nGrief, glancing with keen carelessness from one to the other, laughed.\n\n\"I'm glad the calm held,\" he said. \"It enabled me to get around to see\nyou. My supercargo dug up that little note of yours, and I brought it\nalong.\"\n\nThe mate edged politely away, leaving his skipper to face his trouble.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Grief, damned sorry,\" Griffiths said, \"but I ain't got it.\nYou'll have to give me a little more time.\"\n\nGrief leaned up against the companionway, surprise and pain depicted on\nhis face.\n\n\"It does beat hell,\" he communed, \"how men learn to lie in the Solomons.\nThe truth's not in them. Now take Captain Jensen. I'd sworn by his\ntruthfulness. Why, he told me only five days ago--do you want to know\nwhat he told me?\"\n\nGriffiths licked his lips.\n\n\"Go on.\"\n\n\"Why, he told me that you'd sold out--sold out everything, cleaned up,\nand was pulling out for the New Hebrides.\"\n\n\"He's a damned liar!\" Griffiths cried hotly.\n\nGrief nodded.\n\n\"I should say so. He even had the nerve to tell me that he'd bought two\nof your stations from you--Mauri and Kahula. Said he paid you seventeen\nhundred gold sovereigns, lock, stock and barrel, good will, trade-goods,\ncredit, and copra.\"\n\nGriffiths's eyes narrowed and glinted. The action was involuntary, and\nGrief noted it with a lazy sweep of his eyes.\n\n\"And Parsons, your trader at Hickimavi, told me that the Fulcrum Company\nhad bought that station from you. Now what did he want to lie for?\"\n\nGriffiths, overwrought by sun and sickness, exploded. All his bitterness\nof spirit rose up in his face and twisted his mouth into a snarl.\n\n\"Look here, Grief, what's the good of playing with me that way? You\nknow, and I know you know. Let it go at that. I _have_ sold out, and I\n_am_ getting away. And what are you going to do about it?\"\n\nGrief shrugged his shoulders, and no hint of resolve shadowed itself in\nhis own face. His expression was as of one in a quandary.\n\n\"There's no law here,\" Griffiths pressed home his advantage. \"Tulagi is\na hundred and fifty miles away. I've got my clearance papers, and I'm\non my own boat. There's nothing to stop me from sailing. You've got no\nright to stop me just because I owe you a little money. And by God! you\ncan't stop me. Put that in your pipe.\"\n\nThe look of pained surprise on Grief's face deepened.\n\n\"You mean you're going to cheat me out of that twelve hundred,\nGriffiths?\"\n\n\"That's just about the size of it, old man. And calling hard names won't\nhelp any. There's the wind coming. You'd better get overside before I\npull out, or I'll tow your canoe under.\"\n\n\"Really, Griffiths, you sound almost right. I can't stop you.\" Grief\nfumbled in the pouch that hung on his revolver-belt and pulled out a\ncrumpled official-looking paper. \"But maybe this will stop you. And it's\nsomething for _your_ pipe. Smoke up.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"An admiralty warrant. Running to the New Hebrides won't save you. It\ncan be served anywhere.\"\n\nGriffiths hesitated and swallowed, when he had finished glancing at the\ndocument. With knit brows he pondered this new phase of the situation.\nThen, abruptly, as he looked up, his face relaxed into all frankness.\n\n\"You were cleverer than I thought, old man,\" he said. \"You've got me\nhip and thigh. I ought to have known better than to try and beat you.\nJacobsen told me I couldn't, and I wouldn't listen to him. But he was\nright, and so are you. I've got the money below. Come on down and we'll\nsettle.\"\n\nHe started to go down, then stepped aside to let his visitor precede\nhim, at the same time glancing seaward to where the dark flaw of wind\nwas quickening the water.\n\n\"Heave short,\" he told the mate. \"Get up sail and stand ready to break\nout.\"\n\nAs Grief sat down on the edge of the mate's bunk, close against and\nfacing the tiny table, he noticed the butt of a revolver just projecting\nfrom under the pillow. On the table, which hung on hinges from the\nfor'ard bulkhead, were pen and ink, also a battered log-book.\n\n\"Oh, I don't mind being caught in a dirty trick,\" Griffiths was saying\ndefiantly. \"I've been in the tropics too long. I'm a sick man, a damn\nsick man. And the whiskey, and the sun, and the fever have made me sick\nin morals, too. Nothing's too mean and low for me now, and I can\nunderstand why the niggers eat each other, and take heads, and such\nthings. I could do it myself. So I call trying to do you out of that\nsmall account a pretty mild trick. Wisht I could offer you a drink.\"\n\nGrief made no reply, and the other busied himself in attempting to\nunlock a large and much-dented cash-box. From on deck came falsetto\ncries and the creak and rattle of blocks as the black crew swung up\nmainsail and driver. Grief watched a large cockroach crawling over the\ngreasy paintwork. Griffiths, with an oath of irritation, carried the\ncash-box to the companion-steps for better light. Here, on his feet, and\nbending over the box, his back to his visitor, his hands shot out to\nthe rifle that stood beside the steps, and at the same moment he whirled\nabout.\n\n\"Now don't you move a muscle,\" he commanded.\n\nGrief smiled, elevated his eyebrows quizzically, and obeyed. His left\nhand rested on the bunk beside him; his right hand lay on the table.\n\nHis revolver hung on his right hip in plain sight. But in his mind was\nrecollection of the other revolver under the pillow.\n\n\"Huh!\" Griffiths sneered. \"You've got everybody in the Solomons\nhypnotized, but let me tell you you ain't got me. Now I'm going to throw\nyou off my vessel, along with your admiralty warrant, but first you've\ngot to do something. Lift up that log-book.\"\n\nThe other glanced curiously at the log-book, but did not move.\n\n\"I tell you I'm a sick man, Grief; and I'd as soon shoot you as smash a\ncockroach. Lift up that log-book, I say.\"\n\nSick he did look, his lean face working nervously with the rage that\npossessed him. Grief lifted the book and set it aside. Beneath lay a\nwritten sheet of tablet paper.\n\n\"Read it,\" Griffiths commanded. \"Read it aloud.\"\n\nGrief obeyed; but while he read, the fingers of his left hand began an\ninfinitely slow and patient crawl toward the butt of the weapon under\nthe pillow.\n\n\"On board the ketch Willi-Waw, Bombi Bight, Island of Anna, Solomon\nIslands,\" he read. \"Know all men by these presents that I do hereby sign\noff and release in full, for due value received, all debts whatsoever\nowing to me by Harrison J. Griffiths, who has this day paid to me twelve\nhundred pounds sterling.\"\n\n\"With that receipt in my hands,\" Griffiths grinned, \"your admiralty\nwarrant's not worth the paper it's written on. Sign it.\"\n\n\"It won't do any good, Griffiths,\" Grief said. \"A document signed under\ncompulsion won't hold before the law.\"\n\n\"In that case, what objection have you to signing it then?\"\n\n\"Oh, none at all, only that I might save you heaps of trouble by not\nsigning it.\"\n\nGrief's fingers had gained the revolver, and, while he talked, with his\nright hand he played with the pen and with his left began slowly and\nimperceptibly drawing the weapon to his side. As his hand finally closed\nupon it, second finger on trigger and forefinger laid past the cylinder\nand along the barrel, he wondered what luck he would have at left-handed\nsnap-shooting.\n\n\"Don't consider me,\" Griffiths gibed. \"And just remember Jacobsen will\ntestify that he saw me pay the money over. Now sign, sign in full, at\nthe bottom, David Grief, and date it.\"\n\nFrom on deck came the jar of sheet-blocks and the rat-tat-tat of\nthe reef-points against the canvas. In the cabin they could feel the\n_Willi-Waw_ heel, swing into the wind, and right. David Grief still\nhesitated. From for'ard came the jerking rattle of headsail halyards\nthrough the sheaves. The little vessel heeled, and through the cabin\nwalls came the gurgle and wash of water.\n\n\"Get a move on!\" Griffiths cried. \"The anchor's out.\"\n\nThe muzzle of the rifle, four feet away, was bearing directly on him,\nwhen Grief resolved to act. The rifle wavered as Griffiths kept his\nbalance in the uncertain puffs of the first of the wind. Grief took\nadvantage of the wavering, made as if to sign the paper, and at the same\ninstant, like a cat, exploded into swift and intricate action. As he\nducked low and leaped forward with his body, his left hand flashed from\nunder the screen of the table, and so accurately-timed was the single\nstiff pull on the self-cocking trigger that the cartridge discharged as\nthe muzzle came forward. Not a whit behind was Griffiths. The muzzle\nof his weapon dropped to meet the ducking body, and, shot at snap\ndirection, rifle and revolver went off simultaneously.\n\nGrief felt the sting and sear of a bullet across the skin of his\nshoulder, and knew that his own shot had missed. His forward rush\ncarried him to Griffiths before another shot could be fired, both of\nwhose arms, still holding the rifle, he locked with a low tackle about\nthe body. He shoved the revolver muzzle, still in his left hand, deep\ninto the other's abdomen. Under the press of his anger and the sting of\nhis abraded skin, Grief's finger was lifting the hammer, when the wave\nof anger passed and he recollected himself. Down the companion-way came\nindignant cries from the Gooma boys in his canoe.\n\nEverything was happening in seconds. There was apparently no pause in\nhis actions as he gathered Griffiths in his arms and carried him up the\nsteep steps in a sweeping rush. Out into the blinding glare of sunshine\nhe came. A black stood grinning at the wheel, and the _Willi-Waw_,\nheeled over from the wind, was foaming along. Rapidly dropping astern\nwas his Gooma canoe. Grief turned his head. From amidships, revolver in\nhand, the mate was springing toward him. With two jumps, still holding\nthe helpless Griffiths, Grief leaped to the rail and overboard.\n\nBoth men were grappled together as they went down; but Grief, with\na quick updraw of his knees to the other's chest, broke the grip and\nforced him down. With both feet on Griffiths's shoulder, he forced him\nstill deeper, at the same time driving himself to the surface. Scarcely\nhad his head broken into the sunshine when two splashes of water, in\nquick succession and within a foot of his face, advertised that Jacobsen\nknew how to handle a revolver. There was a chance for no third shot, for\nGrief, filling his lungs with air, sank down. Under water he struck\nout, nor did he come up till he saw the canoe and the bubbling paddles\noverhead. As he climbed aboard, the _Wlli-Waw_ went into the wind to\ncome about.\n\n\"Washee-washee!\" Grief cried to his boys. \"You fella make-um beach quick\nfella time!\"\n\nIn all shamelessness, he turned his back on the battle and ran for\ncover. The _Willi-Waw_, compelled to deaden way in order to pick up its\ncaptain, gave Grief his chance for a lead. The canoe struck the beach\nfull-tilt, with every paddle driving, and they leaped out and ran across\nthe sand for the trees. But before they gained the shelter, three times\nthe sand kicked into puffs ahead of them. Then they dove into the green\nsafety of the jungle.\n\nGrief watched the _Willi-Waw_ haul up close, go out the passage, then\nslack its sheets as it headed south with the wind abeam. As it went out\nof sight past the point he could see the topsail being broken out. One\nof the Gooma boys, a black, nearly fifty years of age, hideously marred\nand scarred by skin diseases and old wounds, looked up into his face and\ngrinned.\n\n\"My word,\" the boy commented, \"that fella skipper too much cross along\nyou.\"\n\nGrief laughed, and led the way back across the sand to the canoe.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nHow many millions David Grief was worth no man in the Solomons knew, for\nhis holdings and ventures were everywhere in the great South Pacific.\nFrom Samoa to New Guinea and even to the north of the Line his\nplantations were scattered. He possessed pearling concessions in the\nPaumotus. Though his name did not appear, he was in truth the German\ncompany that traded in the French Marquesas. His trading stations were\nin strings in all the groups, and his vessels that operated them were\nmany. He owned atolls so remote and tiny that his smallest schooners and\nketches visited the solitary agents but once a year.\n\nIn Sydney, on Castlereagh Street, his offices occupied three floors.\nBut he was rarely in those offices. He preferred always to be on the go\namongst the islands, nosing out new investments, inspecting and shaking\nup old ones, and rubbing shoulders with fun and adventure in a thousand\nstrange guises. He bought the wreck of the great steamship _Gavonne_\nfor a song, and in salving it achieved the impossible and cleaned up a\nquarter of a million. In the Louisiades he planted the first commercial\nrubber, and in Bora-Bora he ripped out the South Sea cotton and put the\njolly islanders at the work of planting cacao. It was he who took the\ndeserted island of Lallu-Ka, colonized it with Polynesians from the\nOntong-Java Atoll, and planted four thousand acres to cocoanuts. And it\nwas he who reconciled the warring chief-stocks of Tahiti and swung the\ngreat deal of the phosphate island of Hikihu.\n\nHis own vessels recruited his contract labour. They brought Santa\nCruz boys to the New Hebrides, New Hebrides boys to the Banks, and the\nhead-hunting cannibals of Malaita to the plantations of New Georgia.\nFrom Tonga to the Gilberts and on to the far Louisiades his recruiters\ncombed the islands for labour. His keels plowed all ocean stretches. He\nowned three steamers on regular island runs, though he rarely elected to\ntravel in them, preferring the wilder and more primitive way of wind and\nsail.\n\nAt least forty years of age, he looked no more than thirty. Yet\nbeachcombers remembered his advent among the islands a score of years\nbefore, at which time the yellow mustache was already budding silkily on\nhis lip. Unlike other white men in the tropics, he was there because he\nliked it. His protective skin pigmentation was excellent. He had\nbeen born to the sun. One he was in ten thousand in the matter of\nsun-resistance. The invisible and high-velocity light waves failed to\nbore into him. Other white men were pervious. The sun drove through\ntheir skins, ripping and smashing tissues and nerves, till they became\nsick in mind and body, tossed most of the Decalogue overboard, descended\nto beastliness, drank themselves into quick graves, or survived so\nsavagely that war vessels were sometimes sent to curb their license.\n\nBut David Grief was a true son of the sun, and he flourished in all its\nways. He merely became browner with the passing of the years, though\nin the brown was the hint of golden tint that glows in the skin of the\nPolynesian. Yet his blue eyes retained their blue, his mustache its\nyellow, and the lines of his face were those which had persisted through\nthe centuries in his English race. English he was in blood, yet those\nthat thought they knew contended he was at least American born. Unlike\nthem, he had not come out to the South Seas seeking hearth and saddle of\nhis own. In fact, he had brought hearth and saddle with him. His advent\nhad been in the Paumotus. He arrived on board a tiny schooner yacht,\nmaster and owner, a youth questing romance and adventure along the\nsun-washed path of the tropics. He also arrived in a hurricane, the\ngiant waves of which deposited him and yacht and all in the thick of a\ncocoanut grove three hundred yards beyond the surf. Six months later he\nwas rescued by a pearling cutter. But the sun had got into his blood.\nAt Tahiti, instead of taking a steamer home, he bought a schooner,\noutfitted her with trade-goods and divers, and went for a cruise through\nthe Dangerous Archipelago.\n\nAs the golden tint burned into his face it poured molten out of the ends\nof his fingers. His was the golden touch, but he played the game, not\nfor the gold, but for the game's sake. It was a man's game, the rough\ncontacts and fierce give and take of the adventurers of his own blood\nand of half the bloods of Europe and the rest of the world, and it was a\ngood game; but over and beyond was his love of all the other things\nthat go to make up a South Seas rover's life--the smell of the reef;\nthe infinite exquisiteness of the shoals of living coral in the\nmirror-surfaced lagoons; the crashing sunrises of raw colours spread\nwith lawless cunning; the palm-tufted islets set in turquoise deeps;\nthe tonic wine of the trade-winds; the heave and send of the orderly,\ncrested seas; the moving deck beneath his feet, the straining canvas\noverhead; the flower-garlanded, golden-glowing men and maids of\nPolynesia, half-children and half-gods; and even the howling savages of\nMelanesia, head-hunters and man-eaters, half-devil and all beast.\n\nAnd so, favoured child of the sun, out of munificence of energy and\nsheer joy of living, he, the man of many millions, forbore on his far\nway to play the game with Harrison J. Griffiths for a paltry sum. It was\nhis whim, his desire, his expression of self and of the sun-warmth that\npoured through him. It was fun, a joke, a problem, a bit of play on\nwhich life was lightly hazarded for the joy of the playing.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nThe early morning found the _Wonder_ laying close-hauled along the coast\nof Guadalcanal She moved lazily through the water under the dying breath\nof the land breeze. To the east, heavy masses of clouds promised a\nrenewal of the southeast trades, accompanied by sharp puffs and rain\nsqualls. Ahead, laying along the coast on the same course as the\n_Wonder_, and being slowly overtaken, was a small ketch. It was not the\n_Willi-Waw_, however, and Captain Ward, on the _Wonder_, putting down\nhis glasses, named it the _Kauri_.\n\nGrief, just on deck from below, sighed regretfully.\n\n\"If it had only been the _Willi-Waw_\" he said.\n\n\"You do hate to be beaten,\" Denby, the supercargo, remarked\nsympathetically.\n\n\"I certainly do.\" Grief paused and laughed with genuine mirth. \"It's my\nfirm conviction that Griffiths is a rogue, and that he treated me quite\nscurvily yesterday. 'Sign,' he says, 'sign in full, at the bottom, and\ndate it,' And Jacobsen, the little rat, stood in with him. It was rank\npiracy, the days of Bully Hayes all over again.\"\n\n\"If you weren't my employer, Mr. Grief, I'd like to give you a piece of\nmy mind,\" Captain Ward broke in.\n\n\"Go on and spit it out,\" Grief encouraged.\n\n\"Well, then--\" The captain hesitated and cleared his throat. \"With all\nthe money you've got, only a fool would take the risk you did with those\ntwo curs. What do you do it for?\"\n\n\"Honestly, I don't know, Captain. I just want to, I suppose. And can you\ngive any better reason for anything you do?\"\n\n\"You'll get your bally head shot off some fine day,\" Captain Ward\ngrowled in answer, as he stepped to the binnacle and took the bearing\nof a peak which had just thrust its head through the clouds that covered\nGuadalcanar.\n\nThe land breeze strengthened in a last effort, and the _Wonder_,\nslipping swiftly through the water, ranged alongside the _Kauri_ and\nbegan to go by. Greetings flew back and forth, then David Grief called\nout:\n\n\"Seen anything of the _Willi-Waw_?\"\n\nThe captain, slouch-hatted and barelegged, with a rolling twist hitched\nthe faded blue _lava-lava_ tighter around his waist and spat tobacco\njuice overside.\n\n\"Sure,\" he answered. \"Griffiths lay at Savo last night, taking on pigs\nand yams and filling his water-tanks. Looked like he was going for a\nlong cruise, but he said no. Why? Did you want to see him?\"\n\n\"Yes; but if you see him first don't tell him you've seen me.\"\n\nThe captain nodded and considered, and walked for'ard on his own deck to\nkeep abreast of the faster vessel.\n\n\"Say!\" he called. \"Jacobsen told me they were coming down this afternoon\nto Gabera. Said they were going to lay there to-night and take on sweet\npotatoes.\"\n\n\"Gabera has the only leading lights in the Solomons,\" Grief said, when\nhis schooner had drawn well ahead. \"Is that right, Captain Ward?\"\n\nThe captain nodded.\n\n\"And the little bight just around the point on this side, it's a rotten\nanchorage, isn't it?\"\n\n\"No anchorage. All coral patches and shoals, and a bad surf. That's\nwhere the _Molly_ went to pieces three years ago.\"\n\nGrief stared straight before him with lustreless eyes for a full minute,\nas if summoning some vision to his inner sight. Then the corners of his\neyes wrinkled and the ends of his yellow mustache lifted in a smile.\n\n\"We'll anchor at Gabera,\" he said. \"And run in close to the little bight\nthis side. I want you to drop me in a whaleboat as you go by. Also,\ngive me six boys, and serve out rifles. I'll be back on board before\nmorning.\"\n\nThe captain's face took on an expression of suspicion, which swiftly\nslid into one of reproach.\n\n\"Oh, just a little fun, skipper,\" Grief protested with the apologetic\nair of a schoolboy caught in mischief by an elder.\n\nCaptain Ward grunted, but Denby was all alertness.\n\n\"I'd like to go along, Mr. Grief,\" he said.\n\nGrief nodded consent.\n\n\"Bring some axes and bush-knives,\" he said. \"And, oh, by the way, a\ncouple of bright lanterns. See they've got oil in them.\"\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nAn hour before sunset the _Wonder_ tore by the little bight. The wind\nhad freshened, and a lively sea was beginning to make. The shoals\ntoward the beach were already white with the churn of water, while those\nfarther out as yet showed no more sign than of discoloured water. As\nthe schooner went into the wind and backed her jib and staysail the\nwhaleboat was swung out. Into it leaped six breech-clouted Santa Cruz\nboys, each armed with a rifle. Denby, carrying the lanterns, dropped\ninto the stern-sheets. Grief, following, paused on the rail.\n\n\"Pray for a dark night, skipper,\" he pleaded.\n\n\"You'll get it,\" Captain Ward answered. \"There's no moon anyway, and\nthere won't be any sky. She'll be a bit squally, too.\"\n\nThe forecast sent a radiance into Grief's face, making more pronounced\nthe golden tint of his sunburn. He leaped down beside the supercargo.\n\n\"Cast off!\" Captain Ward ordered. \"Draw the headsails! Put your wheel\nover! There! Steady! Take that course!\"\n\nThe _Wonder_ filled away and ran on around the point for Gabera, while\nthe whaleboat, pulling six oars and steered by Grief, headed for the\nbeach. With superb boatmanship he threaded the narrow, tortuous channel\nwhich no craft larger than a whaleboat could negotiate, until the shoals\nand patches showed seaward and they grounded on the quiet, rippling\nbeach.\n\nThe next hour was filled with work. Moving about among the wild\ncocoanuts and jungle brush, Grief selected the trees.\n\n\"Chop this fella tree; chop that fella tree,\" he told his blacks. \"No\nchop that other fella,\" he said, with a shake of head.\n\nIn the end, a wedge-shaped segment of jungle was cleared. Near to the\nbeach remained one long palm. At the apex of the wedge stood another.\nDarkness was falling as the lanterns were lighted, carried up the two\ntrees, and made fast.\n\n\"That outer lantern is too high.\" David Grief studied it critically.\n\"Put it down about ten feet, Denby.\"\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\nThe _Willi-Waw_ was tearing through the water with a bone in her teeth,\nfor the breath of the passing squall was still strong. The blacks were\nswinging up the big mainsail, which had been lowered on the run when the\npuff was at its height. Jacobsen, superintending the operation, ordered\nthem to throw the halyards down on deck and stand by, then went for'ard\non the lee-bow and joined Griffiths. Both men stared with wide-strained\neyes at the blank wall of darkness through which they were flying, their\nears tense for the sound of surf on the invisible shore. It was by this\nsound that they were for the moment steering.\n\nThe wind fell lighter, the scud of clouds thinned and broke, and in the\ndim glimmer of starlight loomed the jungle-clad coast. Ahead, and well\non the lee-bow, appeared a jagged rock-point. Both men strained to it.\n\n\"Amboy Point,\" Griffiths announced. \"Plenty of water close up. Take the\nwheel, Jacobsen, till we set a course. Get a move on!\"\n\nRunning aft, barefooted and barelegged, the rainwater dripping from his\nscant clothing, the mate displaced the black at the wheel.\n\n\"How's she heading?\" Griffiths called.\n\n\"South-a-half-west!\"\n\n\"Let her come up south-by-west! Got it?\"\n\n\"Right on it!\"\n\nGriffiths considered the changed relation of Amboy Point to the\n_Willi-Waw_'s course.\n\n\"And a-half-west!\" he cried.\n\n\"And a-half-west!\" came the answer. \"Right on it!\"\n\n\"Steady! That'll do!\"\n\n\"Steady she is!\" Jacobsen turned the wheel over to the savage. \"You\nsteer good fella, savve?\" he warned. \"No good fella, I knock your damn\nblack head off.\"\n\nAgain he went for'ard and joined the other, and again the cloud-scud\nthickened, the star-glimmer vanished, and the wind rose and screamed in\nanother squall.\n\n\"Watch that mainsail!\" Griffiths yelled in the mate's ear, at the same\ntime studying the ketch's behaviour.\n\nOver she pressed, and lee-rail under, while he measured the weight of\nthe wind and quested its easement. The tepid sea-water, with here and\nthere tiny globules of phosphorescence, washed about his ankles and\nknees. The wind screamed a higher note, and every shroud and stay\nsharply chorused an answer as the _Willi-Waw_ pressed farther over and\ndown.\n\n\"Down mainsail!\" Griffiths yelled, springing to the peak-halyards,\nthrusting away the black who held on, and casting off the turn.\n\nJacobsen, at the throat-halyards, was performing the like office. The\nbig sail rattled down, and the blacks, with shouts and yells, threw\nthemselves on the battling canvas. The mate, finding one skulking in the\ndarkness, flung his bunched knuckles into the creature's face and drove\nhim to his work.\n\nThe squall held at its high pitch, and under her small canvas the\n_Willi-Waw_ still foamed along. Again the two men stood for'ard and\nvainly watched in the horizontal drive of rain.\n\n\"We're all right,\" Griffiths said. \"This rain won't last. We can hold\nthis course till we pick up the lights. Anchor in thirteen fathoms.\nYou'd better overhaul forty-five on a night like this. After that get\nthe gaskets on the mainsail. We won't need it.\"\n\nHalf an hour afterward his weary eyes were rewarded by a glimpse of two\nlights.\n\n\"There they are, Jacobsen. I'll take the wheel. Run down the\nfore-staysail and stand by to let go. Make the niggers jump.\"\n\nAft, the spokes of the wheel in his hands, Griffiths held the course\ntill the two lights came in line, when he abruptly altered and headed\ndirectly in for them. He heard the tumble and roar of the surf, but\ndecided it was farther away--as it should be, at Gabera.\n\nHe heard the frightened cry of the mate, and was grinding the wheel down\nwith all his might, when the _Willi-Waw_ struck. At the same instant\nher mainmast crashed over the bow. Five wild minutes followed. All hands\nheld on while the hull upheaved and smashed down on the brittle\ncoral and the warm seas swept over them. Grinding and crunching, the\n_Willi-Waw_ worked itself clear over the shoal patch and came solidly to\nrest in the comparatively smooth and shallow channel beyond.\n\nGriffiths sat down on the edge of the cabin, head bowed on chest, in\nsilent wrath and bitterness. Once he lifted his face to glare at the two\nwhite lights, one above the other and perfectly in line.\n\n\"There they are,\" he said. \"And this isn't Gabera. Then what the hell is\nit?\"\n\nThough the surf still roared and across the shoal flung its spray\nand upper wash over them, the wind died down and the stars came out.\nShoreward came the sound of oars.\n\n\"What have you had?--an earthquake?\" Griffiths called out. \"The bottom's\nall changed. I've anchored here a hundred times in thirteen fathoms. Is\nthat you, Wilson?\"\n\nA whaleboat came alongside, and a man climbed over the rail. In the\nfaint light Griffiths found an automatic Colt's thrust into his face,\nand, looking up, saw David Grief.\n\n\"No, you never anchored here before,\" Grief laughed. \"Gabera's just\naround the point, where I'll be as soon as I've collected that little\nsum of twelve hundred pounds. We won't bother for the receipt. I've your\nnote here, and I'll just return it.\"\n\n\"You did this!\" Griffiths cried, springing to his feet in a sudden gust\nof rage. \"You faked those leading lights! You've wrecked me, and by--\"\n\n\"Steady! Steady!\" Grief's voice was cool and menacing. \"I'll trouble you\nfor that twelve hundred, please.\"\n\nTo Griffiths, a vast impotence seemed to descend upon him. He was\noverwhelmed by a profound disgust--disgust for the sunlands and the\nsun-sickness, for the futility of all his endeavour, for this blue-eyed,\ngolden-tinted, superior man who defeated him on all his ways.\n\n\"Jacobsen,\" he said, \"will you open the cash-box and pay this--this\nbloodsucker--twelve hundred pounds?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Two--THE PROUD GOAT OF ALOYSIUS PANKBURN\n\n\n\n\nI\n\nQuick eye that he had for the promise of adventure, prepared always for\nthe unexpected to leap out at him from behind the nearest cocoanut\ntree, nevertheless David Grief received no warning when he laid eyes on\nAloysius Pankburn. It was on the little steamer _Berthe_. Leaving his\nschooner to follow, Grief had taken passage for the short run across\nfrom Raiatea to Papeete. When he first saw Aloysius Pankburn, that\nsomewhat fuddled gentleman was drinking a lonely cocktail at the tiny\nbar between decks next to the barber shop. And when Grief left the\nbarber's hands half an hour later Aloysius Pankburn was still hanging\nover the bar still drinking by himself.\n\nNow it is not good for man to drink alone, and Grief threw sharp\nscrutiny into his pass-ing glance. He saw a well-built young man of\nthirty, well-featured, well-dressed, and evidently, in the world's\ncatalogue, a gentleman. But in the faint hint of slovenliness, in\nthe shaking, eager hand that spilled the liquor, and in the nervous,\nvacillating eyes, Grief read the unmistakable marks of the chronic\nalcoholic.\n\nAfter dinner he chanced upon Pankburn again. This time it was on deck,\nand the young man, clinging to the rail and peering into the distance\nat the dim forms of a man and woman in two steamer chairs drawn closely\ntogether, was crying, drunkenly. Grief noted that the man's arm was\naround the woman's waist. Aloysius Pankburn looked on and cried.\n\n\"Nothing to weep about,\" Grief said genially.\n\nPankburn looked at him, and gushed tears of profound self-pity.\n\n\"It's hard,\" he sobbed. \"Hard. Hard. That man's my business manager. I\nemploy him. I pay him a good screw. And that's how he earns it.\"\n\n\"In that case, why don't you put a stop to it?\" Grief advised.\n\n\"I can't. She'd shut off my whiskey. She's my trained nurse.\"\n\n\"Fire _her_, then, and drink your head off.\"\n\n\"I can't. He's got all my money. If I did, he wouldn't give me sixpence\nto buy a drink with.\"\n\nThis woful possibility brought a fresh wash of tears. Grief was\ninterested. Of all unique situations he could never have imagined such a\none as this.\n\n\"They were engaged to take care of me,\" Pankburn was blubbering, \"to\nkeep me away from the drink. And that's the way they do it, lollygagging\nall about the ship and letting me drink myself to death. It isn't right,\nI tell you. It isn't right. They were sent along with me for the express\npurpose of not letting me drink, and they let me drink to swinishness\nas long as I leave them alone. If I complain they threaten not to let me\nhave another drop. What can a poor devil do? My death will be on their\nheads, that's all. Come on down and join me.\"\n\nHe released his clutch on the rail, and would have fallen had Grief\nnot caught his arm. He seemed to undergo a transformation, to stiffen\nphysically, to thrust his chin forward aggressively, and to glint\nharshly in his eyes.\n\n\"I won't let them kill me. And they'll be sorry. I've offered them fifty\nthousand--later on, of course. They laughed. They don't know. But I\nknow.\" He fumbled in his coat pocket and drew forth an object that\nflashed in the faint light. \"They don't know the meaning of that. But I\ndo.\" He looked at Grief with abrupt suspicion. \"What do you make out of\nit, eh? What do you make out of it?\"\n\nDavid Grief caught a swift vision of an alcoholic degenerate putting\na very loving young couple to death with a copper spike, for a\ncopper spike was what he held in his hand, an evident old-fashioned\nship-fastening.\n\n\"My mother thinks I'm up here to get cured of the booze habit. She\ndoesn't know. I bribed the doctor to prescribe a voyage. When we get to\nPapeete my manager is going to charter a schooner and away we'll sail.\nBut they don't dream. They think it's the booze. I know. I only know.\nGood night, sir. I'm going to bed--unless--er--you'll join me in a night\ncap. One last drink, you know.\"\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nIn the week that followed at Papeete Grief caught numerous and bizarre\nglimpses of Aloysius Pankburn. So did everybody else in the little\nisland capital; for neither the beach nor Lavina's boarding house\nhad been so scandalized in years. In midday, bareheaded, clad only\nin swimming trunks, Aloysius Pankburn ran down the main street from\nLavina's to the water front. He put on the gloves with a fireman from\nthe _Berthe_ in a scheduled four-round bout at the _Folies Berg\u00c3\u00a8res_,\nand was knocked out in the second round. He tried insanely to drown\nhimself in a two-foot pool of water, dived drunkenly and splendidly from\nfifty feet up in the rigging of the _Mariposa_ lying at the wharf, and\nchartered the cutter _Toerau_ at more than her purchase price and was\nonly saved by his manager's refusal financially to ratify the agreement.\nHe bought out the old blind leper at the market, and sold breadfruit,\nplantains, and sweet potatoes at such cut-rates that the gendarmes\nwere called out to break the rush of bargain-hunting natives. For that\nmatter, three times the gendarmes arrested him for riotous behaviour,\nand three times his manager ceased from love-making long enough to pay\nthe fines imposed by a needy colonial administration.\n\nThen the _Mariposa_ sailed for San Francisco, and in the bridal suite\nwere the manager and the trained nurse, fresh-married. Before departing,\nthe manager had thoughtfully bestowed eight five-pound banknotes on\nAloysius, with the foreseen result that Aloysius awoke several days\nlater to find himself broke and perilously near to delirium tremens.\nLavina, famed for her good heart even among the driftage of South\nPacific rogues and scamps, nursed him around and never let it filter\ninto his returning intelligence that there was neither manager nor money\nto pay his board.\n\nIt was several evenings after this that David Grief, lounging under\nthe after deck awning of the _Kittiwake_ and idly scanning the meagre\ncolumns of the Papeete _Avant-Coureur_, sat suddenly up and almost\nrubbed his eyes. It was unbelievable, but there it was. The old South\nSeas Romance was not dead. He read:\n\n     WANTED--To exchange a half interest in buried treasure,\n     worth five million francs, for transportation for one to an\n     unknown island in the Pacific and facilities for carrying\n     away the loot.   Ask for FOLLY, at Lavina's.\n\nGrief looked at his watch. It was early yet, only eight o'clock.\n\n\"Mr. Carlsen,\" he called in the direction of a glowing pipe. \"Get the\ncrew for the whale-boat. I'm going ashore.\"\n\nThe husky voice of the Norwegian mate was raised for'ard, and half a\ndozen strapping Rapa Islanders ceased their singing and manned the boat.\n\n\"I came to see Folly, Mr. Folly, I imagine,\" David Grief told Lavina.\n\nHe noted the quick interest in her eyes as she turned her head and flung\na command in native across two open rooms to the outstanding kitchen. A\nfew minutes later a barefooted native girl padded in and shook her head.\n\nLavina's disappointment was evident.\n\n\"You're stopping aboard the _Kittiwake_, aren't you?\" she said. \"I'll\ntell him you called.\"\n\n\"Then it is a _he?_\" Grief queried.\n\nLavina nodded.\n\n\"I hope you can do something for him, Captain Grief. I'm only a\ngood-natured woman. I don't know. But he's a likable man, and he may be\ntelling the truth; I don't know. You'll know. You're not a soft-hearted\nfool like me. Can't I mix you a cocktail?\"\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nBack on board his schooner and dozing in a deck chair under a\nthree-months-old magazine, David Grief was aroused by a sobbing,\nslubbering noise from overside. He opened his eyes. From the Chilian\ncruiser, a quarter of a mile away, came the stroke of eight bells. It\nwas midnight. From overside came a splash and another slubbering noise.\nTo him it seemed half amphibian, half the sounds of a man crying to\nhimself and querulously chanting his sorrows to the general universe.\n\nA jump took David Grief to the low rail. Beneath, centred about the\nslubbering noise, was an area of agitated phosphorescence. Leaning over,\nhe locked his hand under the armpit of a man, and, with pull and heave\nand quick-changing grips, he drew on deck the naked form of Aloysius\nPankburn.\n\n\"I didn't have a sou-markee,\" he complained. \"I had to swim it, and I\ncouldn't find your gangway. It was very miserable. Pardon me. If you\nhave a towel to put about my middle, and a good stiff drink, I'll be\nmore myself. I'm Mr. Folly, and you're the Captain Grief, I presume,\nwho called on me when I was out. No, I'm not drunk. Nor am I cold. This\nisn't shivering. Lavina allowed me only two drinks to-day. I'm on the\nedge of the horrors, that's all, and I was beginning to see things\nwhen I couldn't find the gangway. If you'll take me below I'll be very\ngrateful. You are the only one that answered my advertisement.\"\n\nHe was shaking pitiably in the warm night, and down in the cabin, before\nhe got his towel, Grief saw to it that a half-tumbler of whiskey was in\nhis hand.\n\n\"Now fire ahead,\" Grief said, when he had got his guest into a shirt\nand a pair of duck trousers. \"What's this advertisement of yours? I'm\nlistening.\"\n\nPankburn looked at the whiskey bottle, but Grief shook his head.\n\n\"All right, Captain, though I tell you on whatever is left of my honour\nthat I am not drunk--not in the least. Also, what I shall tell you is\ntrue, and I shall tell it briefly, for it is clear to me that you are\na man of affairs and action. Likewise, your chemistry is good. To you\nalcohol has never been a million maggots gnawing at every cell of you.\nYou've never been to hell. I am there now. I am scorching. Now listen.\n\n\"My mother is alive. She is English. I was born in Australia. I\nwas educated at York and Yale. I am a master of arts, a doctor of\nphilosophy, and I am no good. Furthermore, I am an alcoholic. I have\nbeen an athlete. I used to swan-dive a hundred and ten feet in the\nclear. I hold several amateur records. I am a fish. I learned the\ncrawl-stroke from the first of the Cavilles. I have done thirty miles\nin a rough sea. I have another record. I have punished more whiskey than\nany man of my years. I will steal sixpence from you for the price of a\ndrink. Finally, I will tell you the truth.\n\n\"My father was an American--an Annapolis man. He was a midshipman in the\nWar of the Rebellion. In '66 he was a lieutenant on the _Suwanee_. Her\ncaptain was Paul Shirley. In '66 the Suwanee coaled at an island in the\nPacific which I do not care to mention, under a protectorate which did\nnot exist then and which shall be nameless. Ashore, behind the bar of a\npublic house, my father saw three copper spikes--ship's spikes.\"\n\nDavid Grief smiled quietly.\n\n\"And now I can tell you the name of the coaling station and of the\nprotectorate that came afterward,\" he said.\n\n\"And of the three spikes?\" Pankburn asked with equal quietness. \"Go\nahead, for they are in my possession now.\"\n\n\"Certainly. They were behind German Oscar's bar at Peenoo-Peenee. Johnny\nBlack brought them there from off his schooner the night he died. He was\njust back from a long cruise to the westward, fishing beche-de-mer and\nsandalwood trading. All the beach knows the tale.\"\n\nPankburn shook his head.\n\n\"Go on,\" he urged.\n\n\"It was before my time, of course,\" Grief explained. \"I only tell what\nI've heard. Next came the Ecuadoran cruiser, of all directions, in from\nthe westward, and bound home. Her officers recognized the spikes. Johnny\nBlack was dead. They got hold of his mate and logbook. Away to the\nwestward went she. Six months after, again bound home, she dropped in at\nPeenoo-Peenee. She had failed, and the tale leaked out.\"\n\n\"When the revolutionists were marching on Guayaquil,\" Pankburn took it\nup, \"the federal officers, believing a defence of the city hopeless,\nsalted down the government treasure chest, something like a million\ndollars gold, but all in English coinage, and put it on board the\nAmerican schooner _Flirt_. They were going to run at daylight. The\nAmerican captain skinned out in the middle of the night. Go on.\"\n\n\"It's an old story,\" Grief resumed. \"There was no other vessel in the\nharbour. The federal leaders couldn't run. They put their backs to the\nwall and held the city. Rohjas Salced, making a forced march from Quito,\nraised the siege. The revolution was broken, and the one ancient steamer\nthat constituted the Ecuadoran navy was sent in pursuit of the _Flirt_.\nThey caught her, between the Banks Group and the New Hebrides, hove\nto and flying distress signals. The captain had died the day\nbefore--blackwater fever.\"\n\n\"And the mate?\" Pankburn challenged.\n\n\"The mate had been killed a week earlier by the natives on one of the\nBanks, when they sent a boat in for water. There were no navigators\nleft. The men were put to the torture. It was beyond international law.\nThey wanted to confess, but couldn't. They told of the three spikes in\nthe trees on the beach, but where the island was they did not know. To\nthe westward, far to the westward, was all they knew. The tale now goes\ntwo ways. One is that they all died under the torture. The other is that\nthe survivors were swung at the yardarm. At any rate, the Ecuadoran\ncruiser went home without the treasure. Johnny Black brought the three\nspikes to Peenoo-Peenee, and left them at German Oscar's, but how and\nwhere he found them he never told.\"\n\nPankburn looked hard at the whiskey bottle.\n\n\"Just two fingers,\" he whimpered.\n\nGrief considered, and poured a meagre drink. Pankburn's eyes sparkled,\nand he took new lease of life.\n\n\"And this is where I come in with the missing details,\" he said. \"Johnny\nBlack did tell. He told my father. Wrote him from Levuka, before he came\non to die at Peenoo-Peenee. My father had saved his life one rough-house\nnight in Valparaiso. A Chink pearler, out of Thursday Island,\nprospecting for new grounds to the north of New Guinea, traded for the\nthree spikes with a nigger. Johnny Black bought them for copper weight.\nHe didn't dream any more than the Chink, but coming back he stopped for\nhawksbill turtle at the very beach where you say the mate of the\n_Flirt_ was killed. Only he wasn't killed. The Banks Islanders held\nhim prisoner, and he was dying of necrosis of the jawbone, caused by an\narrow wound in the fight on the beach. Before he died he told the yarn\nto Johnny Black. Johnny Black wrote my father from Levuka. He was at the\nend of his rope--cancer. My father, ten years afterward, when captain of\nthe _Perry_, got the spikes from German Oscar. And from my father, last\nwill and testament, you know, came the spikes and the data. I have the\nisland, the latitude and longitude of the beach where the three spikes\nwere nailed in the trees. The spikes are up at Lavina's now. The\nlatitude and longitude are in my head. Now what do you think?\"\n\n\"Fishy,\" was Grief's instant judgment. \"Why didn't your father go and\nget it himself?\"\n\n\"Didn't need it. An uncle died and left him a fortune. He retired from\nthe navy, ran foul of an epidemic of trained nurses in Boston, and my\nmother got a divorce. Also, she fell heir to an income of something like\nthirty thousand dollars, and went to live in New Zealand. I was divided\nbetween them, half-time New Zealand, half-time United States, until my\nfather's death last year. Now my mother has me altogether. He left me\nhis money--oh, a couple of millions--but my mother has had guardians\nappointed on account of the drink. I'm worth all kinds of money, but I\ncan't touch a penny save what is doled out to me. But the old man, who\nhad got the tip on my drinking, left me the three spikes and the data\nthereunto pertaining. Did it through his lawyers, unknown to my mother;\nsaid it beat life insurance, and that if I had the backbone to go and\nget it I could drink my back teeth awash until I died. Millions in the\nhands of my guardians, slathers of shekels of my mother's that'll be\nmine if she beats me to the crematory, another million waiting to be dug\nup, and in the meantime I'm cadging on Lavina for two drinks a day. It's\nhell, isn't it?--when you consider my thirst.\"\n\n\"Where's the island?\"\n\n\"It's a long way from here.\"\n\n\"Name it.\"\n\n\"Not on your life, Captain Grief. You're making an easy half-million out\nof this. You will sail under my directions, and when we're well to sea\nand on our way I'll tell you and not before.\"\n\nGrief shrugged his shoulders, dismissing the subject.\n\n\"When I've given you another drink I'll send the boat ashore with you,\"\nhe said.\n\nPankburn was taken aback. For at least five minutes he debated with\nhimself, then licked his lips and surrendered.\n\n\"If you promise to go, I'll tell you now.\"\n\n\"Of course I'm willing to go. That's why I asked you. Name the island.\"\n\nPankburn looked at the bottle.\n\n\"I'll take that drink now, Captain.\"\n\n\"No you won't. That drink was for you if you went ashore. If you are\ngoing to tell me the island, you must do it in your sober senses.\"\n\n\"Francis Island, if you will have it. Bougainville named it Barbour\nIsland.\"\n\n\"Off there all by its lonely in the Little Coral Sea,\" Grief said. \"I\nknow it. Lies between New Ireland and New Guinea. A rotten hole now,\nthough it was all right when the _Flirt_ drove in the spikes and the\nChink pearler traded for them. The steamship _Castor_, recruiting labour\nfor the Upolu plantations, was cut off there with all hands two years\nago. I knew her captain well. The Germans sent a cruiser, shelled the\nbush, burned half a dozen villages, killed a couple of niggers and a lot\nof pigs, and--and that was all. The niggers always were bad there, but\nthey turned really bad forty years ago. That was when they cut off a\nwhaler. Let me see? What was her name?\"\n\nHe stepped to the bookshelf, drew out the bulky \"South Pacific\nDirectory,\" and ran through its pages.\n\n\"Yes. Here it is. Francis, or Barbour,\" he skimmed. \"Natives warlike and\ntreacherous--Melanesian--cannibals. Whaleship _Western_ cut off--that\nwas her name. Shoals--points--anchorages--ah, Redscar, Owen Bay,\nLikikili Bay, that's more like it; deep indentation, mangrove\nswamps, good holding in nine fathoms when white scar in bluff bears\nwest-southwest.\" Grief looked up. \"That's your beach, Pankburn, I'll\nswear.\"\n\n\"Will you go?\" the other demanded eagerly.\n\nGrief nodded.\n\n\"It sounds good to me. Now if the story had been of a hundred millions,\nor some such crazy sum, I wouldn't look at it for a moment. We'll sail\nto-morrow, but under one consideration. You are to be absolutely under\nmy orders.\"\n\nHis visitor nodded emphatically and joyously.\n\n\"And that means no drink.\"\n\n\"That's pretty hard,\" Pankburn whined.\n\n\"It's my terms. I'm enough of a doctor to see you don't come to harm.\nAnd you are to work--hard work, sailor's work. You'll stand regular\nwatches and everything, though you eat and sleep aft with us.\"\n\n\"It's a go.\" Pankburn put out his hand to ratify the agreement. \"If it\ndoesn't kill me,\" he added.\n\nDavid Grief poured a generous three-fingers into the tumbler and\nextended it.\n\n\"Then here's your last drink. Take it.\"\n\nPankburn's hand went halfway out. With a sudden spasm of resolution, he\nhesitated, threw back his shoulders, and straightened up his head.\n\n\"I guess I won't,\" he began, then, feebly surrendering to the gnaw of\ndesire, he reached hastily for the glass, as if in fear that it would be\nwithdrawn.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nIt is a long traverse from Papeete in the Societies to the Little Coral\nSea--from 100 west longitude to 150 east longitude--as the crow flies\nthe equivalent to a voyage across the Atlantic. But the _Kittiwake_ did\nnot go as the crow flies. David Grief's numerous interests diverted\nher course many times. He stopped to take a look-in at uninhabited Rose\nIsland with an eye to colonizing and planting cocoa-nuts. Next, he paid\nhis respects to Tui Manua, of Eastern Samoa, and opened an intrigue for\na share of the trade monopoly of that dying king's three islands. From\nApia he carried several relief agents and a load of trade goods to the\nGilberts. He peeped in at Ontong-Java Atoll, inspected his plantations\non Ysabel, and purchased lands from the salt-water chiefs of\nnorthwestern Malaita. And all along this devious way he made a man of\nAloysius Pankburn.\n\nThat thirster, though he lived aft, was compelled to do the work of a\ncommon sailor. And not only did he take his wheel and lookout, and heave\non sheets and tackles, but the dirtiest and most arduous tasks were\nappointed him. Swung aloft in a bosun's chair, he scraped the masts and\nslushed down. Holystoning the deck or scrubbing it with fresh limes\nmade his back ache and developed the wasted, flabby muscles. When\nthe _Kittiwake_ lay at anchor and her copper bottom was scrubbed with\ncocoa-nut husks by the native crew, who dived and did it under water,\nPankburn was sent down on his shift and as many times as any on the\nshift.\n\n\"Look at yourself,\" Grief said. \"You are twice the man you were when you\ncame on board. You haven't had one drink, you didn't die, and the poison\nis pretty well worked out of you. It's the work. It beats trained nurses\nand business managers. Here, if you're thirsty. Clap your lips to this.\"\n\nWith several deft strokes of his heavy-backed sheath-knife, Grief\nclipped a triangular piece of shell from the end of a husked\ndrinking-cocoa-nut. The thin, cool liquid, slightly milky and\neffervescent, bubbled to the brim. With a bow, Pankburn took the natural\ncup, threw his head back, and held it back till the shell was empty. He\ndrank many of these nuts each day. The black steward, a New Hebrides boy\nsixty years of age, and his assistant, a Lark Islander of eleven, saw to\nit that he was continually supplied.\n\nPankburn did not object to the hard work. He devoured work, never\nshirking and always beating the native sailors in jumping to obey a\ncommand. But his sufferings during the period of driving the alcohol out\nof his system were truly heroic. Even when the last shred of the poison\nwas exuded, the desire, as an obsession, remained in his head. So it\nwas, when, on his honour, he went ashore at Apia, that he attempted to\nput the public houses out of business by drinking up their stocks in\ntrade. And so it was, at two in the morning, that David Grief found him\nin front of the Tivoli, out of which he had been disorderly thrown by\nCharley Roberts. Aloysius, as of old, was chanting his sorrows to the\nstars. Also, and more concretely, he was punctuating the rhythm with\ncobbles of coral stone, which he flung with amazing accuracy through\nCharley Roberts's windows.\n\nDavid Grief took him away, but not till next morning did he take him\nin hand. It was on the deck of the _Kittiwake_, and there was nothing\nkindergarten about it. Grief struck him, with bare knuckles, punched him\nand punished him--gave him the worst thrashing he had ever received.\n\n\"For the good of your soul, Pankburn,\" was the way he emphasized his\nblows. \"For the good of your mother. For the progeny that will come\nafter. For the good of the world, and the universe, and the whole race\nof man yet to be. And now, to hammer the lesson home, we'll do it all\nover again. That, for the good of your soul; and that, for your mother's\nsake; and that, for the little children, undreamed of and unborn, whose\nmother you'll love for their sakes, and for love's sake, in the lease\nof manhood that will be yours when I am done with you. Come on and take\nyour medicine. I'm not done with you yet. I've only begun. There are\nmany other reasons which I shall now proceed to expound.\" The brown\nsailors and the black stewards and cook looked on and grinned. Far from\nthem was the questioning of any of the mysterious and incomprehensible\nways of white men. As for Carlsen, the mate, he was grimly in accord\nwith the treatment his employer was administering; while Albright, the\nsupercargo, merely played with his mustache and smiled. They were men\nof the sea. They lived life in the rough. And alcohol, in themselves as\nwell as in other men, was a problem they had learned to handle in ways\nnot taught in doctors' schools.\n\n\"Boy! A bucket of fresh water and a towel,\" Grief ordered, when he had\nfinished. \"Two buckets and two towels,\" he added, as he surveyed his own\nhands.\n\n\"You're a pretty one,\" he said to Pankburn. \"You've spoiled everything.\nI had the poison completely out of you. And now you are fairly reeking\nwith it. We've got to begin all over again. Mr. Albright! You know that\npile of old chain on the beach at the boat-landing. Find the owner, buy\nit, and fetch it on board. There must be a hundred and fifty fathoms of\nit. Pankburn! To-morrow morning you start in pounding the rust off of\nit. When you've done that, you'll sandpaper it. Then you'll paint it.\nAnd nothing else will you do till that chain is as smooth as new.\"\n\nAloysius Pankburn shook his head.\n\n\"I quit. Francis Island can go to hell for all of me. I'm done with your\nslave-driving. Kindly put me ashore at once. I'm a white man. You can't\ntreat me this way.\"\n\n\"Mr. Carlsen, you will see that Mr. Pankburn remains on board.\"\n\n\"I'll have you broken for this!\" Aloysius screamed. \"You can't stop me.\"\n\n\"I can give you another licking,\" Grief answered. \"And let me tell you\none thing, you besotted whelp, I'll keep on licking you as long as my\nknuckles hold out or until you yearn to hammer chain rust. I've taken\nyou in hand, and I'm going to make a man out of you if I have to kill\nyou to do it. Now go below and change your clothes. Be ready to turn\nto with a hammer this afternoon. Mr. Albright, get that chain aboard\npronto. Mr. Carlsen, send the boats ashore after it. Also, keep your eye\non Pankburn. If he shows signs of keeling over or going into the shakes,\ngive him a nip--a small one. He may need it after last night.\"\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nFor the rest of the time the _Kittiwake_ lay in Apia Aloysius Pankburn\npounded chain rust. Ten hours a day he pounded. And on the long stretch\nacross to the Gilberts he still pounded.\n\nThen came the sandpapering. One hundred and fifty fathoms is nine\nhundred feet, and every link of all that length was smoothed and\npolished as no link ever was before. And when the last link had received\nits second coat of black paint, he declared himself.\n\n\"Come on with more dirty work,\" he told Grief. \"I'll overhaul the other\nchains if you say so. And you needn't worry about me any more. I'm not\ngoing to take another drop. I'm going to train up. You got my proud\ngoat when you beat me, but let me tell you, you only got it temporarily.\nTrain! I'm going to train till I'm as hard all the way through, and\nclean all the way through, as that chain is. And some day, Mister David\nGrief, somewhere, somehow, I'm going to be in such shape that I'll lick\nyou as you licked me. I'm going to pulp your face till your own niggers\nwon't know you.\"\n\nGrief was jubilant.\n\n\"Now you're talking like a man,\" he cried. \"The only way you'll ever\nlick me is to become a man. And then, maybe--\"\n\nHe paused in the hope that the other would catch the suggestion.\nAloysius groped for it, and, abruptly, something akin to illumination\nshone in his eyes.\n\n\"And then I won't want to, you mean?\"\n\nGrief nodded.\n\n\"And that's the curse of it,\" Aloysius lamented. \"I really believe I\nwon't want to. I see the point. But I'm going to go right on and shape\nmyself up just the same.\"\n\nThe warm, sunburn glow in Grief's face seemed to grow warmer. His hand\nwent out.\n\n\"Pankburn, I love you right now for that.\"\n\nAloysius grasped the hand, and shook his head in sad sincerity.\n\n\"Grief,\" he mourned, \"you've got my goat, you've got my proud goat, and\nyou've got it permanently, I'm afraid.\"\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\nOn a sultry tropic day, when the last flicker of the far southeast trade\nwas fading out and the seasonal change for the northwest monsoon was\ncoming on, the _Kittiwake_ lifted above the sea-rim the jungle-clad\ncoast of Francis Island.\n\nGrief, with compass bearings and binoculars, identified the volcano that\nmarked Redscar, ran past Owen Bay, and lost the last of the breeze at\nthe entrance to Likikili Bay. With the two whaleboats out and towing,\nand with Carl-sen heaving the lead, the _Kittiwake_ sluggishly entered a\ndeep and narrow indentation. There were no beaches. The mangroves began\nat the water's edge, and behind them rose steep jungle, broken here and\nthere by jagged peaks of rock. At the end of a mile, when the white scar\non the bluff bore west-southwest, the lead vindicated the \"Directory,\"\nand the anchor rumbled down in nine fathoms.\n\nFor the rest of that day and until the afternoon of the day following\nthey remained on the _Kittiwake_ and waited. No canoes appeared. There\nwere no signs of human life. Save for the occasional splash of a fish or\nthe screaming of cockatoos, there seemed no other life. Once, however, a\nhuge butterfly, twelve inches from tip to tip, fluttered high over their\nmastheads and drifted across to the opposing jungle.\n\n\"There's no use in sending a boat in to be cut up,\" Grief said.\n\nPankburn was incredulous, and volunteered to go in alone, to swim it if\nhe couldn't borrow the dingey.\n\n\"They haven't forgotten the German cruiser,\" Grief explained. \"And I'll\nwager that bush is alive with men right now. What do you think, Mr.\nCarlsen?\"\n\nThat veteran adventurer of the islands was emphatic in his agreement.\n\nIn the late afternoon of the second day Grief ordered a whaleboat into\nthe water. He took his place in the bow, a live cigarette in his mouth\nand a short-fused stick of dynamite in his hand, for he was bent on\nshooting a mess of fish. Along the thwarts half a dozen Winchesters were\nplaced. Albright, who took the steering-sweep, had a Mauser within reach\nof hand. They pulled in and along the green wall of vegetation. At times\nthey rested on the oars in the midst of a profound silence.\n\n\"Two to one the bush is swarming with them--in quids,\" Albright\nwhispered.\n\nPankburn listened a moment longer and took the bet. Five minutes later\nthey sighted a school of mullet. The brown rowers held their oars. Grief\ntouched the short fuse to his cigarette and threw the stick. So short\nwas the fuse that the stick exploded in the instant after it struck the\nwater. And in that same instant the bush exploded into life. There were\nwild yells of defiance, and black and naked bodies leaped forward like\napes through the mangroves.\n\nIn the whaleboat every rifle was lifted. Then came the wait. A hundred\nblacks, some few armed with ancient Sniders, but the greater portion\narmed with tomahawks, fire-hardened spears, and bone-tipped arrows,\nclustered on the roots that rose out of the bay. No word was spoken.\nEach party watched the other across twenty feet of water. An old,\none-eyed black, with a bristly face, rested a Snider on his hip, the\nmuzzle directed at Albright, who, in turn, covered him back with the\nMauser. A couple of minutes of this tableau endured. The stricken fish\nrose to the surface or struggled half-stunned in the clear depths.\n\n\"It's all right, boys,\" Grief said quietly. \"Put down your guns and\nover the side with you. Mr. Albright, toss the tobacco to that one-eyed\nbrute.\"\n\nWhile the Rapa men dived for the fish, Albright threw a bundle of\ntrade tobacco ashore. The one-eyed man nodded his head and writhed his\nfeatures in an attempt at amiability. Weapons were lowered, bows unbent,\nand arrows put back in their quivers.\n\n\"They know tobacco,\" Grief announced, as they rowed back aboard. \"We'll\nhave visitors. You'll break out a case of tobacco, Mr. Albright, and a\nfew trade-knives. There's a canoe now.\"\n\nOld One-Eye, as befitted a chief and leader, paddled out alone, facing\nperil for the rest of the tribe. As Carlsen leaned over the rail to help\nthe visitor up, he turned his head and remarked casually:\n\n\"They've dug up the money, Mr. Grief. The old beggar's loaded with it.\"\n\nOne-Eye floundered down on deck, grinning appeasingly and failing to\nhide the fear he had overcome but which still possessed him. He was lame\nof one leg, and this was accounted for by a terrible scar, inches deep,\nwhich ran down the thigh from hip to knee. No clothes he wore whatever,\nnot even a string, but his nose, perforated in a dozen places and each\nperforation the setting for a carved spine of bone, bristled like a\nporcupine. Around his neck and hanging down on his dirty chest was a\nstring of gold sovereigns. His ears were hung with silver half-crowns,\nand from the cartilage separating his nostrils depended a big English\npenny, tarnished and green, but unmistakable.\n\n\"Hold on, Grief,\" Pankburn said, with perfectly assumed carelessness.\n\"You say they know only beads and tobacco. Very well. You follow my\nlead. They've found the treasure, and we've got to trade them out of it.\nGet the whole crew aside and lecture them that they are to be interested\nonly in the pennies. Savve? Gold coins must be beneath contempt, and\nsilver coins merely tolerated. Pennies are to be the only desirable\nthings.\"\n\nPankburn took charge of the trading. For the penny in One-Eye's nose he\ngave ten sticks of tobacco. Since each stick cost David Grief a cent,\nthe bargain was manifestly unfair. But for the half-crowns Pankburn gave\nonly one stick each. The string of sovereigns he refused to consider.\nThe more he refused, the more One-Eye insisted on a trade. At last, with\nan appearance of irritation and anger, and as a palpable concession,\nPankburn gave two sticks for the string, which was composed of ten\nsovereigns.\n\n\"I take my hat off to you,\" Grief said to Pankburn that night at dinner.\n\"The situation is patent. You've reversed the scale of value. They'll\nfigure the pennies as priceless possessions and the sovereigns as\nbeneath price. Result: they'll hang on to the pennies and force us to\ntrade for sovereigns. Pankburn, I drink your health! Boy!--another cup\nof tea for Mr. Pankburn.\"\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\nFollowed a golden week. From dawn till dark a row of canoes rested\non their paddles two hundred feet away. This was the deadline. Rapa\nsailors, armed with rifles, maintained it. But one canoe at a time was\npermitted alongside, and but one black at a time was permitted to come\nover the rail. Here, under the awning, relieving one another in hourly\nshifts, the four white men carried on the trade. The rate of exchange\nwas that established by Pankburn with One-Eye. Five sovereigns fetched\na stick of tobacco; a hundred sovereigns, twenty sticks. Thus, a\ncrafty-eyed cannibal would deposit on the table a thousand dollars in\ngold, and go back over the rail, hugely-satisfied, with forty cents'\nworth of tobacco in his hand.\n\n\"Hope we've got enough tobacco to hold out,\" Carlsen muttered dubiously,\nas another case was sawed in half.\n\nAlbright laughed.\n\n\"We've got fifty cases below,\" he said, \"and as I figure it, three cases\nbuy a hundred thousand dollars. There was only a million dollars buried,\nso thirty cases ought to get it. Though, of course, we've got to allow\na margin for the silver and the pennies. That Ecuadoran bunch must have\nsalted down all the coin in sight.\"\n\nVery few pennies and shillings appeared, though Pankburn continually and\nanxiously inquired for them. Pennies were the one thing he seemed to\ndesire, and he made his eyes flash covetously whenever one was produced.\nTrue to his theory, the savages concluded that the gold, being of slight\nvalue, must be disposed of first. A penny, worth fifty times as much as\na sovereign, was something to retain and treasure. Doubtless, in their\njungle-lairs, the wise old gray-beards put their heads together and\nagreed to raise the price on pennies when the worthless gold was all\nworked off. Who could tell? Mayhap the strange white men could be made\nto give even twenty sticks for a priceless copper.\n\nBy the end of the week the trade went slack. There was only the\nslightest dribble of gold. An occasional penny was reluctantly disposed\nof for ten sticks, while several thousand dollars in silver came in.\n\nOn the morning of the eighth day no trading was done. The gray-beards\nhad matured their plan and were demanding twenty sticks for a penny,\nOne-Eye delivered the new rate of exchange. The white men appeared to\ntake it with great seriousness, for they stood together debating in low\nvoices. Had One-Eye understood English he would have been enlightened.\n\n\"We've got just a little over eight hundred thousand, not counting the\nsilver,\" Grief said. \"And that's about all there is. The bush tribes\nbehind have most probably got the other two hundred thousand. Return\nin three months, and the salt-water crowd will have traded back for it;\nalso they will be out of tobacco by that time.\"\n\n\"It would be a sin to buy pennies,\" Albright grinned. \"It goes against\nthe thrifty grain of my trader's soul.\"\n\n\"There's a whiff of land-breeze stirring,\" Grief said, looking at\nPankburn. \"What do you say?\"\n\nPankburn nodded.\n\n\"Very well.\" Grief measured the faintness and irregularity of the wind\nagainst his cheek.\n\n\"Mr. Carlsen, heave short, and get off the gaskets. And stand by with\nthe whaleboats to tow. This breeze is not dependable.\"\n\nHe picked up a part case of tobacco, containing six or seven hundred\nsticks, put it in One-Eye's hands, and helped that bewildered savage\nover the rail. As the foresail went up the mast, a wail of consternation\narose from the canoes lying along the dead-line. And as the anchor\nbroke out and the _Kittiwake's_ head paid off in the light breeze, old\nOne-Eye, daring the rifles levelled on him, paddled alongside and\nmade frantic signs of his tribe's willingness to trade pennies for ten\nsticks.\n\n\"Boy!--a drinking nut,\" Pankburn called.\n\n\"It's Sydney Heads for you,\" Grief said. \"And then what?\"\n\n\"I'm coming back with you for that two hundred thousand,\" Pankburn\nanswered. \"In the meantime I'm going to build an island schooner. Also,\nI'm going to call those guardians of mine before the court to show cause\nwhy my father's money should not be turned over to me. Show cause? I'll\nshow them cause why it should.\"\n\nHe swelled his biceps proudly under the thin sleeve, reached for the two\nblack stewards, and put them above his head like a pair of dumbbells.\n\n\"Come on! Swing out on that fore-boom-tackle!\" Carlsen shouted from aft,\nwhere the mainsail was being winged out.\n\nPankburn dropped the stewards and raced for it, beating a Rapa sailor by\ntwo jumps to the hauling part.\n\n\n\n\nChapter Three--THE DEVILS OF FUATINO\n\n\n\n\nI\n\nOf his many schooners, ketches and cutters that nosed about among the\ncoral isles of the South Seas, David Grief loved most the _Rattler_--a\nyacht-like schooner of ninety tons with so swift a pair of heels that\nshe had made herself famous, in the old days, opium-smuggling from San\nDiego to Puget Sound, raiding the seal-rookeries of Bering Sea, and\nrunning arms in the Far East. A stench and an abomination to government\nofficials, she had been the joy of all sailormen, and the pride of the\nshipwrights who built her. Even now, after forty years of driving, she\nwas still the same old _Rattler_, fore-reaching in the same marvellous\nmanner that compelled sailors to see in order to believe and that\npunctuated many an angry discussion with words and blows on the beaches\nof all the ports from Valparaiso to Manila Bay.\n\nOn this night, close-hauled, her big mainsail preposterously flattened\ndown, her luffs pulsing emptily on the lift of each smooth swell, she\nwas sliding an easy four knots through the water on the veriest whisper\nof a breeze. For an hour David Grief had been leaning on the rail at the\nlee fore-rigging, gazing overside at the steady phosphorescence of her\ngait. The faint back-draught from the headsails fanned his cheek and\nchest with a wine of coolness, and he was in an ecstasy of appreciation\nof the schooner's qualities.\n\n\"Eh!--She's a beauty, Taute, a beauty,\" he said to the Kanaka lookout,\nat the same time stroking the teak of the rail with an affectionate\nhand.\n\n\"Ay, skipper,\" the Kanaka answered in the rich, big-chested tones of\nPolynesia. \"Thirty years I know ships, but never like 'this. On Raiatea\nwe call her _Fanauao_.\"\n\n\"The Dayborn,\" Grief translated the love-phrase. \"Who named her so?\"\n\nAbout to answer, Taute peered ahead with sudden intensity. Grief joined\nhim in the gaze.\n\n\"Land,\" said Taute.\n\n\"Yes; Fuatino,\" Grief agreed, his eyes still fixed on the spot where\nthe star-luminous horizon was gouged by a blot of blackness. \"It's all\nright. I'll tell the captain.\"\n\nThe _Rattler_ slid along until the loom of the island could be seen as\nwell as sensed, until the sleepy roar of breakers and the blatting of\ngoats could be heard, until the wind, off the land, was flower-drenched\nwith perfume.\n\n\"If it wasn't a crevice, she could run the passage a night like this,\"\nCaptain Glass remarked regretfully, as he watched the wheel lashed hard\ndown by the steersman.\n\nThe _Rattler_, run off shore a mile, had been hove to to wait until\ndaylight ere she attempted the perilous entrance to Fuatino. It was a\nperfect tropic night, with no hint of rain or squall. For'ard, wherever\ntheir tasks left them, the Raiatea sailors sank down to sleep on deck.\nAft, the captain and mate and Grief spread their beds with similar\nlanguid unconcern. They lay on their blankets, smoking and murmuring\nsleepy conjectures about Mataara, the Queen of Fuatino, and about the\nlove affair between her daughter, Naumoo, and Motuaro.\n\n\"They're certainly a romantic lot,\" Brown, the mate, said. \"As romantic\nas we whites.\"\n\n\"As romantic as Pilsach,\" Grief laughed, \"and that is going some. How\nlong ago was it, Captain, that he jumped you?\"\n\n\"Eleven years,\" Captain Glass grunted resentfully.\n\n\"Tell me about it,\" Brown pleaded. \"They say he's never left Fuatino\nsince. Is that right?\"\n\n\"Right O,\" the captain rumbled. \"He's in love with his wife--the little\nhussy! Stole him from me, and as good a sailorman as the trade has ever\nseen--if he is a Dutchman.\"\n\n\"German,\" Grief corrected.\n\n\"It's all the same,\" was the retort. \"The sea was robbed of a good man\nthat night he went ashore and Notutu took one look at him. I reckon they\nlooked good to each other. Before you could say skat, she'd put a wreath\nof some kind of white flowers on his head, and in five minutes they were\noff down the beach, like a couple of kids, holding hands and laughing. I\nhope he's blown that big coral patch out of the channel. I always start\na sheet or two of copper warping past.\"\n\n\"Go on with the story,\" Brown urged.\n\n\"That's all. He was finished right there. Got married that night. Never\ncame on board again. I looked him up next day. Found him in a straw\nhouse in the bush, barelegged, a white savage, all mixed up with flowers\nand things and playing a guitar. Looked like a bally ass. Told me to\nsend his things ashore. I told him I'd see him damned first. And that's\nall. You'll see her to-morrow. They've got three kiddies now--wonderful\nlittle rascals. I've a phonograph down below for him, and about a\nmillion records.\"\n\n\"And then you made him trader?\" the mate inquired of Grief.\n\n\"What else could I do? Fuatino is a love island, and Filsach is a lover.\nHe knows the native, too--one of the best traders I've got, or ever had.\nHe's responsible. You'll see him to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Look here, young man,\" Captain Glass rumbled threateningly at his mate.\n\"Are you romantic? Because if you are, on board you stay. Fuatino's the\nisland of romantic insanity. Everybody's in love with somebody. They\nlive on love. It's in the milk of the cocoa-nuts, or the air, or the\nsea. The history of the island for the last ten thousand years is\nnothing but love affairs. I know. I've talked with the old men. And if I\ncatch you starting down the beach hand in hand--\"\n\nHis sudden cessation caused both the other men to look at him. They\nfollowed his gaze, which passed across them to the main rigging, and saw\nwhat he saw, a brown hand and arm, muscular and wet, being joined from\noverside by a second brown hand and arm. A head followed, thatched with\nlong elfin locks, and then a face, with roguish black eyes, lined with\nthe marks of wildwood's laughter.\n\n\"My God!\" Brown breathed. \"It's a faun--a sea-faun.\"\n\n\"It's the Goat Man,\" said Glass.\n\n\"It is Mauriri,\" said Grief. \"He is my own blood brother by sacred\nplight of native custom. His name is mine, and mine is his.\"\n\nBroad brown shoulders and a magnificent chest rose above the rail, and,\nwith what seemed effortless ease, the whole grand body followed over\nthe rail and noiselessly trod the deck. Brown, who might have been other\nthings than the mate of an island schooner, was enchanted. All that he\nhad ever gleaned from the books proclaimed indubitably the faun-likeness\nof this visitant of the deep. \"But a sad faun,\" was the young man's\njudgment, as the golden-brown woods god strode forward to where David\nGrief sat up with outstretched hand.\n\n\"David,\" said David Grief.\n\n\"Mauriri, Big Brother,\" said Mauriri.\n\nAnd thereafter, in the custom of men who have pledged blood brotherhood,\neach called the other, not by the other's name, but by his own. Also,\nthey talked in the Polynesian tongue of Fuatino, and Brown could only\nsit and guess.\n\n\"A long swim to say _talofa_,\" Grief said, as the other sat and streamed\nwater on the deck.\n\n\"Many days and nights have I watched for your coming, Big Brother,\"\nMauriri replied. \"I have sat on the Big Rock, where the dynamite\nis kept, of which I have been made keeper. I saw you come up to the\nentrance and run back into darkness. I knew you waited till morning, and\nI followed. Great trouble has come upon us. Mataara has cried these many\ndays for your coming. She is an old woman, and Motauri is dead, and she\nis sad.\"\n\n\"Did he marry Naumoo?\" Grief asked, after he had shaken his head and\nsighed by the custom.\n\n\"Yes. In the end they ran to live with the goats, till Mataara forgave,\nwhen they returned to live with her in the Big House. But he is now\ndead, and Naumoo soon will die. Great is our trouble, Big Brother. Tori\nis dead, and Tati-Tori, and Petoo, and Nari, and Pilsach, and others.\"\n\n\"Pilsach, too!\" Grief exclaimed. \"Has there been a sickness?\"\n\n\"There has been much killing. Listen, Big Brother, Three weeks ago a\nstrange schooner came. From the Big Rock I saw her topsails above the\nsea. She towed in with her boats, but they did not warp by the big\npatch, and she pounded many times. She is now on the beach, where they\nare strengthening the broken timbers. There are eight white men on\nboard. They have women from some island far to the east. The women\ntalk a language in many ways like ours, only different. But we can\nunderstand. They say they were stolen by the men on the schooner. We do\nnot know, but they sing and dance and are happy.\"\n\n\"And the men?\" Grief interrupted.\n\n\"They talk French. I know, for there was a mate on your schooner who\ntalked French long ago. There are two chief men, and they do not look\nlike the others. They have blue eyes like you, and they are devils. One\nis a bigger devil than the other. The other six are also devils. They do\nnot pay us for our yams, and taro, and breadfruit. They take everything\nfrom us, and if we complain they kill us. Thus was killed Tori, and\nTati-Tori, and Petoo, and others. We cannot fight, for we have no\nguns--only two or three old guns.\n\n\"They ill-treat our women. Thus was killed Motuaro, who made defence of\nNaumoo, whom they have now taken on board their schooner. It was because\nof this that Pilsach was killed. Him the chief of the two chief men, the\nBig Devil, shot once in his whaleboat, and twice when he tried to crawl\nup the sand of the beach. Pilsach was a brave man, and Notutu now sits\nin the house and cries without end. Many of the people are afraid, and\nhave run to live with the goats. But there is not food for all in the\nhigh mountains. And the men will not go out and fish, and they work no\nmore in the gardens because of the devils who take all they have. And we\nare ready to fight.\n\n\"Big Brother, we need guns, and much ammunition. I sent word before I\nswam out to you, and the men are waiting. The strange white men do not\nknow you are come. Give me a boat, and the guns, and I will go back\nbefore the sun. And when you come to-morrow we will be ready for the\nword from you to kill the strange white men. They must be killed. Big\nBrother, you have ever been of the blood with us, and the men and women\nhave prayed to many gods for your coming. And you are come.\"\n\n\"I will go in the boat with you,\" Grief said.\n\n\"No, Big Brother,\" was Mauriri's reply. \"You must be with the schooner.\nThe strange white men will fear the schooner, not us. We will have the\nguns, and they will not know. It is only when they see your schooner\ncome that they will be alarmed. Send the young man there with the boat.\"\n\nSo it was that Brown, thrilling with all the romance and adventure he\nhad read and guessed and never lived, took his place in the sternsheets\nof a whaleboat, loaded with rifles and cartridges, rowed by four Baiatea\nsailors, steered by a golden-brown, sea-swimming faun, and directed\nthrough the warm tropic darkness toward the half-mythical love island of\nFuatino, which had been invaded by twentieth century pirates.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nIf a line be drawn between Jaluit, in the Marshall Group, and\nBougainville, in the Solomons, and if this line be bisected at two\ndegrees south of the equator by a line drawn from Ukuor, in the\nCarolines, the high island of Fuatino will be raised in that sun-washed\nstretch of lonely sea. Inhabited by a stock kindred to the Hawaiian,\nthe Samoan, the Tahitian, and the Maori, Fuatino becomes the apex of the\nwedge driven by Polynesia far to the west and in between Melanesia and\nMicronesia. And it was Fuatino that David Grief raised next morning,\ntwo miles to the east and in direct line with the rising sun. The same\nwhisper of a breeze held, and the _Rattler_ slid through the smooth sea\nat a rate that would have been eminently proper for an island schooner\nhad the breeze been thrice as strong.\n\nFuatino was nothing else than an ancient crater, thrust upward from the\nsea-bottom by some primordial cataclysm. The western portion, broken\nand crumbled to sea level, was the entrance to the crater itself, which\nconstituted the harbour. Thus, Fuatino was like a rugged horseshoe, the\nheel pointing to the west. And into the opening at the heel the Rattler\nsteered. Captain Glass, binoculars in hand and peering at the chart made\nby himself, which was spread on top the cabin, straightened up with an\nexpression on his face that was half alarm, half resignation.\n\n\"It's coming,\" he said. \"Fever. It wasn't due till to-morrow. It always\nhits me hard, Mr. Grief. In five minutes I'll be off my head. You'll\nhave to con the schooner in. Boy! Get my bunk ready! Plenty of blankets!\nFill that hot-water bottle! It's so calm, Mr. Grief, that I think you\ncan pass the big patch without warping. Take the leading wind and shoot\nher. She's the only craft in the South Pacific that can do it, and I\nknow you know the trick. You can scrape the Big Rock by just watching\nout for the main boom.\"\n\nHe had talked rapidly, almost like a drunken man, as his reeling brain\nbattled with the rising shock of the malarial stroke. When he stumbled\ntoward the companionway, his face was purpling and mottling as if\nattacked by some monstrous inflammation or decay. His eyes were setting\nin a glassy bulge, his hands shaking, his teeth clicking in the spasms\nof chill.\n\n\"Two hours to get the sweat,\" he chattered with a ghastly grin. \"And a\ncouple more and I'll be all right. I know the damned thing to the last\nminute it runs its course. Y-y-you t-t-take ch-ch-ch-ch----\"\n\nHis voice faded away in a weak stutter as he collapsed down into the\ncabin and his employer took charge. The _Rattler_ was just entering the\npassage. The heels of the horseshoe island were two huge mountains of\nrock a thousand feet high, each almost broken off from the mainland and\nconnected with it by a low and narrow peninsula. Between the heels was\na half-mile stretch, all but blocked by a reef of coral extending across\nfrom the south heel. The passage, which Captain Glass had called a\ncrevice, twisted into this reef, curved directly to the north heel, and\nran along the base of the perpendicular rock. At this point, with the\nmain-boom almost grazing the rock on the port side, Grief, peering down\non the starboard side, could see bottom less than two fathoms beneath\nand shoaling steeply. With a whaleboat towing for steerage and as a\nprecaution against back-draughts from the cliff, and taking advantage of\na fan of breeze, he shook the Rattler full into it and glided by the big\ncoral patch without warping. As it was, he just scraped, but so softly\nas not to start the copper.\n\nThe harbour of Fuatino opened before him. It was a circular sheet of\nwater, five miles in diameter, rimmed with white coral beaches, from\nwhich the verdure-clad slopes rose swiftly to the frowning crater walls.\nThe crests of the walls were saw-toothed, volcanic peaks, capped and\nhalo'd with captive trade-wind clouds. Every nook and crevice of the\ndisintegrating lava gave foothold to creeping, climbing vines and\ntrees--a green foam of vegetation. Thin streams of water, that were\nmere films of mist, swayed and undulated downward in sheer descents\nof hundreds of feet. And to complete the magic of the place, the warm,\nmoist air was heavy with the perfume of the yellow-blossomed _cassi_.\n\nFanning along against light, vagrant airs, the _Rattler_ worked in.\nCalling the whale-boat on board, Grief searched out the shore with his\nbinoculars. There was no life. In the hot blaze of tropic sun the place\nslept. There was no sign of welcome. Up the beach, on the north shore,\nwhere the fringe of cocoanut palms concealed the village, he could see\nthe black bows of the canoes in the canoe-houses. On the beach, on even\nkeel, rested the strange schooner. Nothing moved on board of her or\naround her. Not until the beach lay fifty yards away did Grief let go\nthe anchor in forty fathoms. Out in the middle, long years before, he\nhad sounded three hundred fathoms without reaching bottom, which was to\nbe expected of a healthy crater-pit like Fuatino. As the chain roared\nand surged through the hawse-pipe he noticed a number of native women,\nlusciously large as only those of Polynesia are, in flowing _ahu's_,\nflower-crowned, stream out on the deck of the schooner on the beach.\nAlso, and what they did not see, he saw from the galley the squat figure\nof a man steal for'ard, drop to the sand, and dive into the green screen\nof bush.\n\nWhile the sails were furled and gasketed, awnings stretched, and sheets\nand tackles coiled harbour fashion, David Grief paced the deck and\nlooked vainly for a flutter of life elsewhere than on the strange\nschooner. Once, beyond any doubt, he heard the distant crack of a rifle\nin the direction of the Big Rock. There were no further shots, and he\nthought of it as some hunter shooting a wild goat.\n\nAt the end of another hour Captain Glass, under a mountain of blankets,\nhad ceased shivering and was in the inferno of a profound sweat.\n\n\"I'll be all right in half an hour,\" he said weakly.\n\n\"Very well,\" Grief answered. \"The place is dead, and I'm going ashore to\nsee Mataara and find out the situation.\"\n\n\"It's a tough bunch; keep your eyes open,\" the captain warned him. \"If\nyou're not back in an hour, send word off.\"\n\nGrief took the steering-sweep, and four of his Raiatea men bent to the\noars. As they landed on the beach he looked curiously at the women under\nthe schooner's awning. He waved his hand tentatively, and they, after\ngiggling, waved back.\n\n\"_Talofa!_\" he called.\n\nThey understood the greeting, but replied, \"_Iorana_,\" and he knew they\ncame from the Society Group.\n\n\"Huahine,\" one of his sailors unhesitatingly named their island. Grief\nasked them whence they came, and with giggles and laughter they replied,\n\"Huahine.\"\n\n\"It looks like old Dupuy's schooner,\" Grief said, in Tahitian, speaking\nin a low voice. \"Don't look too hard. What do you think, eh? Isn't it\nthe _Valetta?_\"\n\nAs the men climbed out and lifted the whale-boat slightly up the beach\nthey stole careless glances at the vessel.\n\n\"It is the _Valetta_,\" Taute said. \"She carried her topmast away seven\nyears ago. At Papeete they rigged a new one. It was ten feet shorter.\nThat is the one.\"\n\n\"Go over and talk with the women, you boys. You can almost see Huahine\nfrom Raiatea, and you'll be sure to know some of them. Find out all you\ncan. And if any of the white men show up, don't start a row.\"\n\nAn army of hermit crabs scuttled and rustled away before him as he\nadvanced up the beach, but under the palms no pigs rooted and grunted.\nThe cocoanuts lay where they had fallen, and at the copra-sheds there\nwere no signs of curing. Industry and tidiness had vanished. Grass\nhouse after grass house he found deserted. Once he came upon an old\nman, blind, toothless, prodigiously wrinkled, who sat in the shade and\nbabbled with fear when he spoke to him. It was as if the place had been\nstruck with the plague, was Grief's thought, as he finally approached\nthe Big House. All was desolation and disarray. There were no\nflower-crowned men and maidens, no brown babies rolling in the shade of\nthe avocado trees. In the doorway, crouched and rocking back and forth,\nsat Mataara, the old queen. She wept afresh at sight of him, divided\nbetween the tale of her woe and regret that no follower was left to\ndispense to him her hospitality.\n\n\"And so they have taken Naumoo,\" she finished. \"Motauri is dead. My\npeople have fled and are starving with the goats. And there is no one to\nopen for you even a drinking cocoa-nut. O Brother, your white brothers\nbe devils.\"\n\n\"They are no brothers of mine, Mataara,\" Grief consoled. \"They are\nrobbers and pigs, and I shall clean the island of them----\"\n\nHe broke off to whirl half around, his hand flashing to his waist and\nback again, the big Colt's levelled at the figure of a man, bent double,\nthat rushed at him from out of the trees. He did not pull the trigger,\nnor did the man pause till he had flung himself headlong at Grief's\nfeet and begun to pour forth a stream of uncouth and awful noises. He\nrecognized the creature as the one he had seen steal from the _Valetta_\nand dive into the bush; but not until he raised him up and watched\nthe contortions of the hare-lipped mouth could he understand what he\nuttered.\n\n\"Save me, master, save me!\" the man yammered, in English, though he was\nunmistakably a South Sea native. \"I know you! Save me!\"\n\nAnd thereat he broke into a wild outpour of incoherence that did\nnot cease until Grief seized him by the shoulders and shook him into\nsilence.\n\n\"I know you,\" Grief said. \"You were cook in the French Hotel at Papeete\ntwo years ago. Everybody called you 'Hare-Lip.'\"\n\nThe man nodded violently.\n\n\"I am now cook of the _Valetta_,\" he spat and spluttered, his mouth\nwrithing in a fearful struggle with its defect. \"I know you. I saw you\nat the hotel. I saw you at Lavina's. I saw you on the _Kittiwake_. I saw\nyou at the _Mariposa_ wharf. You are Captain Grief, and you will save\nme. Those men are devils. They killed Captain Dupuy. Me they made kill\nhalf the crew. Two they shot from the cross-trees. The rest they shot\nin the water. I knew them all. They stole the girls from Huahine. They\nadded to their strength with jail-men from Noumea. They robbed the\ntraders in the New Hebrides. They killed the trader at Vanikori, and\nstole two women there. They----\"\n\nBut Grief no longer heard. Through the trees, from the direction of\nthe harbour, came a rattle of rifles, and he started on the run for the\nbeach. Pirates from Tahiti and convicts from New Caledonia! A pretty\nbunch of desperadoes that even now was attacking his schooner. Hare-Lip\nfollowed, still spluttering and spitting his tale of the white devils'\ndoings.\n\nThe rifle-firing ceased as abruptly as it had begun, but Grief ran\non, perplexed by ominous conjectures, until, in a turn of the path, he\nencountered Mauriri running toward him from the beach.\n\n\"Big Brother,\" the Goat Man panted, \"I was too late. They have taken\nyour schooner. Come! For now they will seek for you.\"\n\nHe started back up the path away from the beach.\n\n\"Where is Brown?\" Grief demanded.\n\n\"On the Big Rock. I will tell you afterward. Come now!\"\n\n\"But my men in the whaleboat?\"\n\nMauriri was in an agony of apprehension.\n\n\"They are with the women on the strange schooner. They will not be\nkilled. I tell you true. The devils want sailors. But you they will\nkill. Listen!\" From the water, in a cracked tenor voice, came a French\nhunting song. \"They are landing on the beach. They have taken your\nschooner--that I saw. Come!\"\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nCareless of his own life and skin, nevertheless David Grief was\npossessed of no false hardihood. He knew when to fight and when to run,\nand that this was the time for running he had no doubt. Up the path,\npast the old men sitting in the shade, past Mataara crouched in the\ndoorway of the Big House, he followed at the heels of Mauriri. At his\nown heels, doglike, plodded Hare-Lip. From behind came the cries of the\nhunters, but the pace Mauriri led them was heartbreaking. The broad path\nnarrowed, swung to the right, and pitched upward. The last grass house\nwas left, and through high thickets of _cassi_ and swarms of great\ngolden wasps the way rose steeply until it became a goat-track. Pointing\nupward to a bare shoulder of volcanic rock, Mauriri indicated the trail\nacross its face.\n\n\"Past that we are safe, Big Brother,\" he said. \"The white devils never\ndare it, for there are rocks we roll down on their heads, and there\nis no other path. Always do they stop here and shoot when we cross the\nrock. Come!\"\n\nA quarter of an hour later they paused where the trail went naked on the\nface of the rock.\n\n\"Wait, and when you come, come quickly,\" Mauriri cautioned.\n\nHe sprang into the blaze of sunlight, and from below several rifles\npumped rapidly. Bullets smacked about him, and puffs of stone-dust\nflew out, but he won safely across. Grief followed, and so near did\none bullet come that the dust of its impact stung his cheek. Nor was\nHare-Lip struck, though he essayed the passage more slowly.\n\nFor the rest of the day, on the greater heights, they lay in a lava glen\nwhere terraced taro and _papaia_ grew. And here Grief made his plans and\nlearned the fulness of the situation.\n\n\"It was ill luck,\" Mauriri said. \"Of all nights this one night was\nselected by the white devils to go fishing. It was dark as we came\nthrough the passage. They were in boats and canoes. Always do they have\ntheir rifles with them. One Raiatea man they shot. Brown was very brave.\nWe tried to get by to the top of the bay, but they headed us off, and we\nwere driven in between the Big Rock and the village. We saved the guns\nand all the ammunition, but they got the boat. Thus they learned of your\ncoming. Brown is now on this side of the Big Rock with the guns and the\nammunition.\"\n\n\"But why didn't he go over the top of the Big Rock and give me warning\nas I came in from the sea?\" Grief criticised.\n\n\"They knew not the way. Only the goats and I know the way. And this I\nforgot, for I crept through the bush to gain the water and swim to you.\nBut the devils were in the bush shooting at Brown and the Raiatea men;\nand me they hunted till daylight, and through the morning they hunted\nme there in the low-lying land. Then you came in your schooner, and they\nwatched till you went ashore, and I got away through the bush, but you\nwere already ashore.\"\n\n\"You fired that shot?\"\n\n\"Yes; to warn you. But they were wise and would not shoot back, and it\nwas my last cartridge.\"\n\n\"Now you, Hare-Lip?\" Grief said to the _Valetta's_ cook.\n\nHis tale was long and painfully detailed. For a year he had been sailing\nout of Tahiti and through the Paumotus on the _Valetta_. Old Dupuy was\nowner and captain. On his last cruise he had shipped two strangers in\nTahiti as mate and supercargo. Also, another stranger he carried to be\nhis agent on Fanriki. Raoul Van Asveld and Carl Lepsius were the names\nof the mate and supercargo.\n\n\"They are brothers, I know, for I have heard them talk in the dark, on\ndeck, when they thought no one listened,\" Hare-Lip explained.\n\nThe _Valetta_ cruised through the Low Islands, picking up shell and\npearls at Dupuy's stations. Frans Amundson, the third stranger, relieved\nPierre Gollard at Fanriki. Pierre Gollard came on board to go back to\nTahiti. The natives of Fanriki said he had a quart of pearls to turn\nover to Dupuy. The first night out from Fanriki there was shooting\nin the cabin. Then the bodies of Dupuy and Pierre Gollard were thrown\noverboard. The Tahitian sailors fled to the forecastle. For two days,\nwith nothing to eat and the _Valetta_ hove to, they remained below. Then\nRaoul Van Asveld put poison in the meal he made Hare-Lip cook and carry\nfor'ard. Half the sailors died.\n\n\"He had a rifle pointed at me, master; what could I do?\" Hare-Lip\nwhimpered. \"Of the rest, two went up the rigging and were shot. Fanriki\nwas ten miles away. The others went overboard to swim. They were shot\nas they swam. I, only, lived, and the two devils; for me they wanted to\ncook for them. That day, with the breeze, they went back to Fanrika and\ntook on Frans Amundson, for he was one of them.\"\n\nThen followed Hare-Lip's nightmare experiences as the schooner wandered\non the long reaches to the westward. He was the one living witness and\nknew they would have killed him had he not been the cook. At Noumea five\nconvicts had joined them. Hare-Lip was never permitted ashore at any of\nthe islands, and Grief was the first outsider to whom he had spoken.\n\n\"And now they will kill me,\" Hare-Lip spluttered, \"for they will know\nI have told you. Yet am I not all a coward, and I will stay with you,\nmaster, and die with you.\"\n\nThe Goat Man shook his head and stood up.\n\n\"Lie here and rest,\" he said to Grief. \"It will be a long swim to-night.\nAs for this cook-man, I will take him now to the higher places where my\nbrothers live with the goats.\"\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\"It is well that you swim as a man should, Big Brother,\" Mauriri\nwhispered.\n\nFrom the lava glen they had descended to the head of the bay and taken\nto the water. They swam softly, without splash, Mauriri in the lead. The\nblack walls of the crater rose about them till it seemed they swam\non the bottom of a great bowl. Above was the sky of faintly luminous\nstar-dust. Ahead they could see the light which marked the Rattler, and\nfrom her deck, softened by distance, came a gospel hymn played on the\nphonograph intended for Pilsach.\n\nThe two swimmers bore to the left, away from the captured schooner.\nLaughter and song followed on board after the hymn, then the phonograph\nstarted again. Grief grinned to himself at the appositeness of it as\n\"Lead, Kindly Light,\" floated out over the dark water.\n\n\"We must take the passage and land on the Big Rock,\" Mauriri whispered.\n\"The devils are holding the low land. Listen!\"\n\nHalf a dozen rifle shots, at irregular intervals, attested that Brown\nstill held the Rock and that the pirates had invested the narrow\npeninsula.\n\nAt the end of another hour they swam under the frowning loom of the Big\nRock. Mauriri, feeling his way, led the landing in a crevice, up which\nfor a hundred feet they climbed to a narrow ledge.\n\n\"Stay here,\" said Mauriri. \"I go to Brown. In the morning I shall\nreturn.\"\n\n\"I will go with you, Brother,\" Grief said.\n\nMauriri laughed in the darkness.\n\n\"Even you, Big Brother, cannot do this thing. I am the Goat Man, and\nI only, of all Fuatino, can go over the Big Rock in the night.\nFurthermore, it will be the first time that even I have done it. Put out\nyour hand. You feel it? That is where Pilsach's dynamite is kept. Lie\nclose beside the wall and you may sleep without falling. I go now.\"\n\nAnd high above the sounding surf, on a narrow shelf beside a ton of\ndynamite, David Grief planned his campaign, then rested his cheek on his\narm and slept.\n\nIn the morning, when Mauriri led him over the summit of the Big Rock,\nDavid Grief understood why he could not have done it in the night.\nDespite the accustomed nerve of a sailor for height and precarious\nclinging, he marvelled that he was able to do it in the broad light of\nday. There were places, always under minute direction of Mauriri, that\nhe leaned forward, falling, across hundred-foot-deep crevices, until his\noutstretched hands struck a grip on the opposing wall and his legs could\nthen be drawn across after. Once, there was a ten-foot leap, above half\na thousand feet of yawning emptiness and down a fathom's length to a\nmeagre foothold. And he, despite his cool head, lost it another time on\na shelf, a scant twelve inches wide, where all hand-holds seemed to fail\nhim. And Mauriri, seeing him sway, swung his own body far out and over\nthe gulf and passed him, at the same time striking him sharply on the\nback to brace his reeling brain. Then it was, and forever after, that he\nfully knew why Mauriri had been named the Goat Man.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nThe defence of the Big Rock had its good points and its defects.\nImpregnable to assault, two men could hold it against ten thousand.\nAlso, it guarded the passage to open sea. The two schooners, Raoul Van\nAsveld, and his cutthroat following were bottled up. Grief, with the ton\nof dynamite, which he had removed higher up the rock, was master. This\nhe demonstrated, one morning, when the schooners attempted to put to\nsea. The _Valetta_ led, the whaleboat towing her manned by captured\nFuatino men. Grief and the Goat Man peered straight down from a safe\nrock-shelter, three hundred feet above. Their rifles were beside them,\nalso a glowing fire-stick and a big bundle of dynamite sticks with fuses\nand decanators attached. As the whaleboat came beneath, Mauriri shook\nhis head.\n\n\"They are our brothers. We cannot shoot.\"\n\nFor'ard, on the _Valetta_, were several of Grief's own Raiatea sailors.\nAft stood another at the wheel. The pirates were below, or on the other\nschooner, with the exception of one who stood, rifle in hand, amidships.\nFor protection he held Naumoo, the Queen's daughter, close to him.\n\n\"That is the chief devil,\" Mauriri whispered, \"and his eyes are blue\nlike yours. He is a terrible man. See! He holds Naumoo that we may not\nshoot him.\"\n\nA light air and a slight tide were making into the passage, and the\nschooner's progress was slow.\n\n\"Do you speak English?\" Grief called down.\n\nThe man startled, half lifted his rifle to the perpendicular, and looked\nup. There was something quick and catlike in his movements, and in his\nburned blond face a fighting eagerness. It was the face of a killer.\n\n\"Yes,\" he answered. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\"Turn back, or I'll blow your schooner up,\" Grief warned. He blew on the\nfire-stick and whispered, \"Tell Naumoo to break away from him and run\naft.\"\n\nFrom the _Rattler_, close astern, rifles cracked, and bullets spatted\nagainst the rock. Van Asveld laughed defiantly, and Mauriri called\ndown in the native tongue to the woman. When directly beneath, Grief,\nwatching, saw her jerk away from the man. On the instant Grief touched\nthe fire-stick to the match-head in the split end of the short fuse,\nsprang into view on the face of the rock, and dropped the dynamite. Van\nAsveld had managed to catch the girl and was struggling with her. The\nGoat Man held a rifle on him and waited a chance. The dynamite struck\nthe deck in a compact package, bounded, and rolled into the port\nscupper. Van Asveld saw it and hesitated, then he and the girl ran aft\nfor their lives. The Goat Man fired, but splintered the corner of the\ngalley. The spattering of bullets from the _Rattler_ increased, and the\ntwo on the rock crouched low for shelter and waited. Mauriri tried to\nsee what was happening below, but Grief held him back.\n\n\"The fuse was too long,\" he said. \"I'll know better next time.\"\n\nIt was half a minute before the explosion came. What happened afterward,\nfor some little time, they could not tell, for the Rattler's marksmen\nhad got the range and were maintaining a steady fire. Once, fanned by a\ncouple of bullets, Grief risked a peep. The _Valetta_, her port deck\nand rail torn away, was listing and sinking as she drifted back into the\nharbour. Climbing on board the _Rattler_ were the men and the Huahine\nwomen who had been hidden in the _Valetta's_ cabin and who had swum for\nit under the protecting fire. The Fuatino men who had been towing in the\nwhaleboat had cast off the line, dashed back through the passage, and\nwere rowing wildly for the south shore.\n\nFrom the shore of the peninsula the discharges of four rifles announced\nthat Brown and his men had worked through the jungle to the beach and\nwere taking a hand. The bullets ceased coming, and Grief and Mauriri\njoined in with their rifles. But they could do no damage, for the men of\nthe _Rattler_ were firing from the shelter of the deck-houses, while the\nwind and tide carried the schooner farther in.\n\nThere was no sign of the _Valetta_, which had sunk in the deep water of\nthe crater.\n\nTwo things Raoul Van Asveld did that showed his keenness and coolness\nand that elicited Grief's admiration. Under the _Rattler's_ rifle fire\nRaoul compelled the fleeing Fuatino men to come in and surrender. And at\nthe same time, dispatching half his cutthroats in the _Rattler's_ boat,\nhe threw them ashore and across the peninsula, preventing Brown from\ngetting away to the main part of the island. And for the rest of the\nmorning the intermittent shooting told to Grief how Brown was being\ndriven in to the other side of the Big Rock. The situation was\nunchanged, with the exception of the loss of the _Valetta_.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\nThe defects of the position on the Big Rock were vital. There was\nneither food nor water. For several nights, accompanied by one of the\nRaiatea men, Mauriri swam to the head of the bay for supplies. Then came\nthe night when lights flared on the water and shots were fired. After\nthat the water-side of the Big Rock was invested as well.\n\n\"It's a funny situation,\" Brown remarked, who was getting all the\nadventure he had been led to believe resided in the South Seas. \"We've\ngot hold and can't let go, and Raoul has hold and can't let go. He can't\nget away, and we're liable to starve to death holding him.\"\n\n\"If the rain came, the rock-basins would fill,\" said Mauriri. It was\ntheir first twenty-four hours without water. \"Big Brother, to-night you\nand I will get water. It is the work of strong men.\"\n\nThat night, with cocoanut calabashes, each of quart capacity and tightly\nstoppered, he led Grief down to the water from the peninsula side of the\nBig Rock. They swam out not more than a hundred feet. Beyond, they could\nhear the occasional click of an oar or the knock of a paddle against\na canoe, and sometimes they saw the flare of matches as the men in the\nguarding boats lighted cigarettes or pipes.\n\n\"Wait here,\" whispered Mauriri, \"and hold the calabashes.\"\n\nTurning over, he swam down. Grief, face downward, watched his\nphosphorescent track glimmer, and dim, and vanish. A long minute\nafterward Mauriri broke surface noiselessly at Grief's side.\n\n\"Here! Drink!\"\n\nThe calabash was full, and Grief drank sweet fresh water which had come\nup from the depths of the salt.\n\n\"It flows out from the land,\" said Mauriri.\n\n\"On the bottom?\"\n\n\"No. The bottom is as far below as the mountains are above. Fifty feet\ndown it flows. Swim down until you feel its coolness.\"\n\nSeveral times filling and emptying his lungs in diver fashion, Grief\nturned over and went down through the water. Salt it was to his lips,\nand warm to his flesh; but at last, deep down, it perceptibly chilled\nand tasted brackish. Then, suddenly, his body entered the cold,\nsubterranean stream. He removed the small stopper from the calabash,\nand, as the sweet water gurgled into it, he saw the phosphorescent\nglimmer of a big fish, like a sea ghost, drift sluggishly by.\n\nThereafter, holding the growing weight of the calabashes, he remained on\nthe surface, while Mauriri took them down, one by one, and filled them.\n\n\"There are sharks,\" Grief said, as they swam back to shore.\n\n\"Pooh!\" was the answer. \"They are fish sharks. We of Fuatino are\nbrothers to the fish sharks.\"\n\n\"But the tiger sharks? I have seen them here.\"\n\n\"When they come, Big Brother, we will have no more water to\ndrink--unless it rains.\"\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\nA week later Mauriri and a Raiatea man swam back with empty calabashes.\nThe tiger sharks had arrived in the harbour. The next day they thirsted\non the Big Rock.\n\n\"We must take our chance,\" said Grief. \"Tonight I shall go after water\nwith Mautau. Tomorrow night, Brother, you will go with Tehaa.\"\n\nThree quarts only did Grief get, when the tiger sharks appeared and\ndrove them in. There were six of them on the Rock, and a pint a day, in\nthe sweltering heat of the mid-tropics, is not sufficient moisture for a\nman's body. The next night Mauriri and Tehaa returned with no water. And\nthe day following Brown learned the full connotation of thirst, when the\nlips crack to bleeding, the mouth is coated with granular slime, and the\nswollen tongue finds the mouth too small for residence.\n\nGrief swam out in the darkness with Mautau. Turn by turn, they went down\nthrough the salt, to the cool sweet stream, drinking their fill while\nthe calabashes were filling. It was Mau-tau's turn to descend with the\nlast calabash, and Grief, peering down from the surface, saw the glimmer\nof sea-ghosts and all the phosphorescent display of the struggle. He\nswam back alone, but without relinquishing the precious burden of full\ncalabashes.\n\nOf food they had little. Nothing grew on the Rock, and its sides,\ncovered with shellfish at sea level where the surf thundered in, were\ntoo precipitous for access. Here and there, where crevices permitted, a\nfew rank shellfish and sea urchins were gleaned. Sometimes frigate birds\nand other sea birds were snared. Once, with a piece of frigate bird,\nthey succeeded in hooking a shark. After that, with jealously guarded\nshark-meat for bait, they managed on occasion to catch more sharks.\n\nBut water remained their direst need. Mauriri prayed to the Goat\nGod for rain. Taute prayed to the Missionary God, and his two fellow\nislanders, backsliding, invoked the deities of their old heathen days.\nGrief grinned and considered. But Brown, wild-eyed, with protruding\nblackened tongue, cursed. Especially he cursed the phonograph that\nin the cool twilights ground out gospel hymns from the deck of the\n_Rattler_. One hymn in particular, \"Beyond the Smiling and the Weeping,\"\ndrove him to madness. It seemed a favourite on board the schooner, for\nit was played most of all. Brown, hungry and thirsty, half out of\nhis head from weakness and suffering, could lie among the rocks with\nequanimity and listen to the tinkling of ukuleles and guitars, and\nthe hulas and himines of the Huahine women. But when the voices of the\nTrinity Choir floated over the water he was beside himself. One evening\nthe cracked tenor took up the song with the machine:\n\n     \"Beyond the smiling and the weeping,\n        I shall be soon.\n     Beyond the waking and the sleeping,\n     Beyond the sowing and the reaping,\n        I shall be soon,\n        I shall be soon.\"\n\nThen it was that Brown rose up. Again and again, blindly, he emptied his\nrifle at the schooner. Laughter floated up from the men and women, and\nfrom the peninsula came a splattering of return bullets; but the cracked\ntenor sang on, and Brown continued to fire, until the hymn was played\nout.\n\nIt was that night that Grief and Mauriri came back with but one calabash\nof water. A patch of skin six inches long was missing from Grief's\nshoulder in token of the scrape of the sandpaper hide of a shark whose\ndash he had eluded.\n\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\nIn the early morning of another day, before the sun-blaze had gained its\nfull strength, came an offer of a parley from Raoul Van Asveld.\n\nBrown brought the word in from the outpost among the rocks a hundred\nyards away. Grief was squatted over a small fire, broiling a strip of\nshark-flesh. The last twenty-four hours had been lucky. Seaweed and sea\nurchins had been gathered. Tehaa had caught a shark, and Mauriri had\ncaptured a fair-sized octopus at the base of the crevice where the\ndynamite was stored. Then, too, in the darkness they had made two\nsuccessful swims for water before the tiger sharks had nosed them out.\n\n\"Said he'd like to come in and talk with you,\" Brown said. \"But I know\nwhat the brute is after. Wants to see how near starved to death we are.\"\n\n\"Bring him in,\" Grief said.\n\n\"And then we will kill him,\" the Goat Man cried joyously.\n\nGrief shook his head.\n\n\"But he is a killer of men, Big Brother, a beast and a devil,\" the Goat\nMan protested.\n\n\"He must not be killed, Brother. It is our way not to break our word.\"\n\n\"It is a foolish way.\"\n\n\"Still it is our way,\" Grief answered gravely, turning the strip of\nshark-meat over on the coals and noting the hungry sniff and look of\nTehaa. \"Don't do that, Tehaa, when the Big Devil comes. Look as if you\nand hunger were strangers. Here, cook those sea urchins, you, and you,\nBig Brother, cook the squid. We will have the Big Devil to feast with\nus. Spare nothing. Cook all.\"\n\nAnd, still broiling meat, Grief arose as Raoul Van Asveld, followed by a\nlarge Irish terrier, strode into camp. Raoul did not make the mistake of\nholding out his hand.\n\n\"Hello!\" he said. \"I've heard of you.\"\n\n\"I wish I'd never heard of you,\" Grief answered.\n\n\"Same here,\" was the response. \"At first, before I knew who it was,\nI thought I had to deal with an ordinary trading captain. That's why\nyou've got me bottled up.\"\n\n\"And I am ashamed to say that I underrated you,\" Grief smiled. \"I took\nyou for a thieving beachcomber, and not for a really intelligent pirate\nand murderer. Hence, the loss of my schooner. Honours are even, I fancy,\non that score.\"\n\nRaoul flushed angrily under his sunburn, but he contained himself. His\neyes roved over the supply of food and the full water-calabashes, though\nhe concealed the incredulous surprise he felt. His was a tall, slender,\nwell-knit figure, and Grief, studying him, estimated his character\nfrom his face. The eyes were keen and strong, but a bit too close\ntogether--not pinched, however, but just a trifle near to balance the\nbroad forehead, the strong chin and jaw, and the cheekbones wide apart.\nStrength! His face was filled with it, and yet Grief sensed in it the\nintangible something the man lacked.\n\n\"We are both strong men,\" Raoul said, with a bow. \"We might have been\nfighting for empires a hundred years ago.\"\n\nIt was Grief's turn to bow.\n\n\"As it is, we are squalidly scrapping over the enforcement of the\ncolonial laws of those empires whose destinies we might possibly have\ndetermined a hundred years ago.\"\n\n\"It all comes to dust,\" Raoul remarked sen-tentiously, sitting down. \"Go\nahead with your meal. Don't let me interrupt.\"\n\n\"Won't you join us?\" was Grief's invitation.\n\nThe other looked at him with sharp steadiness, then accepted.\n\n\"I'm sticky with sweat,\" he said. \"Can I wash?\"\n\nGrief nodded and ordered Mauriri to bring a calabash. Raoul looked into\nthe Goat Man's eyes, but saw nothing save languid uninterest as the\nprecious quart of water was wasted on the ground.\n\n\"The dog is thirsty,\" Raoul said.\n\nGrief nodded, and another calabash was presented to the animal.\n\nAgain Raoul searched the eyes of the natives and learned nothing.\n\n\"Sorry we have no coffee,\" Grief apologized. \"You'll have to drink plain\nwater. A calabash, Tehaa. Try some of this shark. There is squid to\nfollow, and sea urchins and a seaweed salad. I'm sorry we haven't any\nfrigate bird. The boys were lazy yesterday, and did not try to catch\nany.\"\n\nWith an appetite that would not have stopped at wire nails dipped in\nlard, Grief ate perfunctorily, and tossed the scraps to the dog.\n\n\"I'm afraid I haven't got down to the primitive diet yet,\" he sighed,\nas he sat back. \"The tinned goods on the _Rattler_, now I could make a\nhearty meal off of them, but this muck----\" He took a half-pound strip\nof broiled shark and flung it to the dog. \"I suppose I'll come to it if\nyou don't surrender pretty soon.\"\n\nRaoul laughed unpleasantly.\n\n\"I came to offer terms,\" he said pointedly.\n\nGrief shook his head.\n\n\"There aren't any terms. I've got you where the hair is short, and I'm\nnot going to let go.\"\n\n\"You think you can hold me in this hole!\" Raoul cried.\n\n\"You'll never leave it alive, except in double irons.\" Grief surveyed\nhis guest with an air of consideration. \"I've handled your kind before.\nWe've pretty well cleaned it out of the South Seas. But you are a--how\nshall I say?--a sort of an anachronism. You're a throwback, and we've\ngot to get rid of you. Personally, I would advise you to go back to the\nschooner and blow your brains out. It is the only way to escape what\nyou've got coming to you.\"\n\nThe parley, so far as Raoul was concerned, proved fruitless, and he went\nback into his own lines convinced that the men on the Big Rock could\nhold out for years, though he would have been swiftly unconvinced could\nhe have observed Tehaa and the Raiateans, the moment his back was\nturned and he was out of sight, crawling over the rocks and sucking and\ncrunching the scraps his dog had left uneaten.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\"We hunger now, Brother,\" Grief said, \"but it is better than to hunger\nfor many days to come. The Big Devil, after feasting and drinking good\nwater with us in plenty, will not stay long in Fuatino. Even to-morrow\nmay he try to leave. To-night you and I sleep over the top of the Rock,\nand Tehaa, who shoots well, will sleep with us if he can dare the Rock.\"\n\nTehaa, alone among the Raiateans, was cragsman enough to venture the\nperilous way, and dawn found him in a rock-barricaded nook, a hundred\nyards to the right of Grief and Mauriri.\n\nThe first warning was the firing of rifles from the peninsula, where\nBrown and his two Raiateans signalled the retreat and followed the\nbesiegers through the jungle to the beach. From the eyrie on the face\nof the rock Grief could see nothing for another hour, when the _Rattler_\nappeared, making for the passage. As before, the captive Fuatino men\ntowed in the whaleboat. Mauriri, under direction of Grief, called down\ninstructions to them as they passed slowly beneath. By Grief's side\nlay several bundles of dynamite sticks, well-lashed together and with\nextremely short fuses.\n\nThe deck of the _Rattler_ was populous. For'ard, rifle in hand, among\nthe Raiatean sailors, stood a desperado whom Mauriri announced was\nRaoul's brother. Aft, by the helmsman, stood another. Attached to him,\ntied waist to waist, with slack, was Mataara, the old Queen. On the\nother side of the helmsman, his arm in a sling, was Captain Glass.\nAmidships, as before, was Raoul, and with him, lashed waist to waist,\nwas Naumoo.\n\n\"Good morning, Mister David Grief,\" Raoul called up.\n\n\"And yet I warned you that only in double irons would you leave the\nisland,\" Grief murmured down with a sad inflection.\n\n\"You can't kill all your people I have on board,\" was the answer.\n\nThe schooner, moving slowly, jerk by jerk, as the men pulled in the\nwhaleboat, was almost directly beneath. The rowers, without ceasing,\nslacked on their oars, and were immediately threatened with the rifle of\nthe man who stood for'ard.\n\n\"Throw, Big Brother!\" Naumoo called up in the Fuatino tongue. \"I am\nfilled with sorrow and am willed to die. His knife is ready with which\nto cut the rope, but I shall hold him tight. Be not afraid, Big Brother.\nThrow, and throw straight, and good-bye.\"\n\nGrief hesitated, then lowered the fire-stick which he had been blowing\nbright.\n\n\"Throw!\" the Goat Man urged.\n\nStill Grief hesitated.\n\n\"If they get to sea, Big Brother, Naumoo dies just the same. And there\nare all the others. What is her life against the many?\"\n\n\"If you drop any dynamite, or fire a single shot, we'll kill all on\nboard,\" Raoul cried up to them. \"I've got you, David Grief. You can't\nkill these people, and I can. Shut up, you!\"\n\nThis last was addressed to Naumoo, who was calling up in her native\ntongue and whom Raoul seized by the neck with one hand to choke\nto silence. In turn, she locked both arms about him and looked up\nbeseechingly to Grief.\n\n\"Throw it, Mr. Grief, and be damned to them,\" Captain Glass rumbled\nin his deep voice. \"They're bloody murderers, and the cabin's full of\nthem.\"\n\nThe desperado who was fastened to the old Queen swung half about to\nmenace Captain Glass with his rifle, when Tehaa, from his position\nfarther along the Rock, pulled trigger on him. The rifle dropped from\nthe man's hand, and on his face was an expression of intense surprise as\nhis legs crumpled under him and he sank down on deck, dragging the Queen\nwith him.\n\n\"Port! Hard a port!\" Grief cried.\n\nCaptain Glass and the Kanaka whirled the wheel over, and the bow of the\n_Rattler_ headed in for the Rock. Amidships Raoul still struggled with\nNaumoo. His brother ran from for'ard to his aid, being missed by the\nfusillade of quick shots from Tehaa and the Goat Man. As Raoul's brother\nplaced the muzzle of his rifle to Naumoo's side Grief touched the\nfire-stick to the match-head in the split end of the fuse. Even as with\nboth hands he tossed the big bundle of dynamite, the rifle went off,\nand Naumoo's fall to the deck was simultaneous with the fall of the\ndynamite. This time the fuse was short enough. The explosion occurred\nat the instant the deck was reached, and that portion of the _Rattler_,\nalong with Raoul, his brother, and Naumoo, forever disappeared.\n\nThe schooner's side was shattered, and she began immediately to settle.\nFor'ard, every Raiatean sailor dived overboard. Captain Glass met the\nfirst man springing up the com-panionway from the cabin, with a kick\nfull in the face, but was overborne and trampled on by the rush.\nFollowing the desperadoes came the Huahine women, and as they went\noverboard, the _Rattler_ sank on an even keel close to the base of the\nRock. Her cross-trees still stuck out when she reached bottom.\n\nLooking down, Grief could see all that occurred beneath the surface. He\nsaw Mataara, a fathom deep, unfasten herself from the dead pirate and\nswim upward. As her head emerged she saw Captain Glass, who could not\nswim, sinking several yards away. The Queen, old woman that she was,\nbut an islander, turned over, swam down to him, and held him up as she\nstruck out for the unsubmerged cross-trees.\n\nFive heads, blond and brown, were mingled with the dark heads of\nPolynesia that dotted the surface. Grief, rifle in hand, watched for a\nchance to shoot. The Goat Man, after a minute, was successful, and they\nsaw the body of one man sink sluggishly. But to the Raiatean sailors,\nbig and brawny, half fish, was the vengeance given. Swimming swiftly,\nthey singled out the blond heads and the brown. Those from above watched\nthe four surviving desperadoes, clutched and locked, dragged far down\nbeneath and drowned like curs.\n\nIn ten minutes everything was over. The Huahine women, laughing and\ngiggling, were holding on to the sides of the whaleboat which had done\nthe towing. The Raiatean sailors, waiting for orders, were about the\ncross-tree to which Captain Glass and Mataara clung.\n\n\"The poor old _Rattler_,\" Captain Glass lamented.\n\n\"Nothing of the sort,\" Grief answered. \"In a week we'll have her raised,\nnew timbers amidships, and we'll be on our way.\" And to the Queen, \"How\nis it with you, Sister?\"\n\n\"Naumoo is gone, and Motauri, Brother, but Fuatino is ours again. The\nday is young. Word shall be sent to all my people in the high places\nwith the goats. And to-night, once again, and as never before, we shall\nfeast and rejoice in the Big House.\"\n\n\"She's been needing new timbers abaft the beam there for years,\" quoth\nCaptain Glass. \"But the chronometers will be out of commission for the\nrest of the cruise.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter Four--THE JOKERS OF NEW GIBBON\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\"I'm almost afraid to take you in to New Gibbon,\" David Grief said. \"It\nwasn't until you and the British gave me a free hand and let the place\nalone that any results were accomplished.\"\n\nWallenstein, the German Resident Commissioner from Bougainville, poured\nhimself a long Scotch and soda and smiled.\n\n\"We take off our hats to you, Mr. Grief,\" he said in perfectly good\nEnglish. \"What you have done on the devil island is a miracle. And we\nshall continue not to interfere. It _is_ a devil island, and old Koho is\nthe big chief devil of them all. We never could bring him to terms. He\nis a liar, and he is no fool. He is a black Napoleon, a head-hunting,\nman-eating Talleyrand. I remember six years ago, when I landed there in\nthe British cruiser. The niggers cleared out for the bush, of course,\nbut we found several who couldn't get away. One was his latest wife. She\nhad been hung up by one arm in the sun for two days and nights. We\ncut her down, but she died just the same. And staked out in the fresh\nrunning water, up to their necks, were three more women. All their bones\nwere broken and their joints crushed. The process is supposed to make\nthem tender for the eating. They were still alive. Their vitality was\nremarkable. One woman, the oldest, lingered nearly ten days. Well, that\nwas a sample of Koho's diet. No wonder he's a wild beast. How you ever\npacified him is our everlasting puzzlement.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't call him exactly pacified,\" Grief answered. \"Though he comes\nin once in a while and eats out of the hand.\"\n\n\"That's more than we accomplished with our cruisers. Neither the German\nnor the English ever laid eyes on him. You were the first.\"\n\n\"No; McTavish was the first,\" Grief disclaimed.\n\n\"Ah, yes, I remember him--the little, dried-up Scotchman.\" Wallenstein\nsipped his whiskey. \"He's called the Trouble-mender, isn't he?\"\n\nGrief nodded.\n\n\"And they say the screw you pay him is bigger than mine or the British\nResident's?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid it is,\" Grief admitted. \"You see, and no offence, he's\nreally worth it. He spends his time wherever the trouble is. He is a\nwizard. He's the one who got me my lodgment on New Gibbon. He's down on\nMalaita now, starting a plantation for me.\"\n\n\"The first?\"\n\n\"There's not even a trading station on all Malaita. The recruiters still\nuse covering boats and carry the old barbed wire above their rails.\nThere's the plantation now. We'll be in in half an hour.\" He handed the\nbinoculars to his guest. \"Those are the boat-sheds to the left of the\nbungalow. Beyond are the barracks. And to the right are the copra-sheds.\nWe dry quite a bit already. Old Koho's getting civilized enough to make\nhis people bring in the nuts. There's the mouth of the stream where you\nfound the three women softening.\"\n\nThe _Wonder_, wing-and-wing, was headed directly in for the anchorage.\nShe rose and fell lazily over a glassy swell flawed here and there by\ncatspaws from astern. It was the tail-end of the monsoon season, and the\nair was heavy and sticky with tropic moisture, the sky a florid, leaden\nmuss of formless clouds. The rugged land was swathed with cloud-banks\nand squall wreaths, through which headlands and interior peaks thrust\ndarkly. On one promontory a slant of sunshine blazed torridly, on\nanother, scarcely a mile away, a squall was bursting in furious downpour\nof driving rain.\n\nThis was the dank, fat, savage island of New Gibbon, lying fifty miles\nto leeward of Choiseul. Geographically, it belonged to the Solomon\nGroup. Politically, the dividing line of German and British\ninfluence cut it in half, hence the joint control by the two Resident\nCommissioners. In the case of New Gibbon, this control existed only on\npaper in the colonial offices of the two countries. There was no real\ncontrol at all, and never had been. The b\u00c3\u00aache de mer fishermen of\nthe old days had passed it by. The sandalwood traders, after stern\nexperiences, had given it up. The blackbirders had never succeeded in\nrecruiting one labourer on the island, and, after the schooner _Dorset_\nhad been cut off with all hands, they left the place severely alone.\nLater, a German company had attempted a cocoanut plantation, which was\nabandoned after several managers and a number of contract labourers had\nlost their heads. German cruisers and British cruisers had failed to\nget the savage blacks to listen to reason. Four times the missionary\nsocieties had essayed the peaceful conquest of the island, and four\ntimes, between sickness and massacre, they had been driven away, More\ncruisers, more pacifications, had followed, and followed fruitlessly.\nThe cannibals had always retreated into the bush and laughed at the\nscreaming shells. When the warships left it was an easy matter\nto rebuild the burned grass houses and set up the ovens in the\nold-fashioned way.\n\nNew Gibbon was a large island, fully one hundred and fifty miles long\nand half as broad.\n\nIts windward coast was iron-bound, without anchorages or inlets, and it\nwas inhabited by scores of warring tribes--at least it had been,\nuntil Koho had arisen, like a Kamehameha, and, by force of arms and\nconsiderable statecraft, firmly welded the greater portion of the tribes\ninto a confederation. His policy of permitting no intercourse with white\nmen had been eminently right, so far as survival of his own people was\nconcerned; and after the visit of the last cruiser he had had his own\nway until David Grief and McTavish the Trouble-mender landed on the\ndeserted beach where once had stood the German bungalow and barracks and\nthe various English mission-houses.\n\nFollowed wars, false peaces, and more wars. The weazened little\nScotchman could make trouble as well as mend it, and, not content with\nholding the beach, he imported bushmen from Malaita and invaded the\nwild-pig runs of the interior jungle. He burned villages until Koho\nwearied of rebuilding them, and when he captured Koho's eldest son he\ncompelled a conference with the old chief. It was then that McTavish\nlaid down the rate of head-exchange. For each head of his own people\nhe promised to take ten of Koho's. After Koho had learned that the\nScotchman was a man of his word, the first true peace was made. In\nthe meantime McTavish had built the bungalow and barracks, cleared the\njungle-land along the beach, and laid out the plantation. After that\nhe had gone on his way to mend trouble on the atoll of Tasman, where\na plague of black measles had broken out and been ascribed to Grief's\nplantation by the devil-devil doctors. Once, a year later, he had been\ncalled back again to straighten up New Gibbon; and Koho, after paying a\nforced fine of two hundred thousand cocoanuts, decided it was cheaper\nto keep the peace and sell the nuts. Also, the fires of his youth\nhad burned down. He was getting old and limped of one leg where a\nLee-Enfield bullet had perforated the calf.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\"I knew a chap in Hawaii,\" Grief said, \"superintendent of a sugar\nplantation, who used a hammer and a ten-penny nail.\"\n\nThey were sitting on the broad bungalow veranda, and watching Worth, the\nmanager of New Gibbon, doctoring the sick squad. They were New Georgia\nboys, a dozen of them, and the one with the aching tooth had been put\nback to the last. Worth had just failed in his first attempt. He wiped\nthe sweat from his forehead with one hand and waved the forceps with the\nother.\n\n\"And broke more than one jaw,\" he asserted grimly.\n\nGrief shook his head. Wallenstein smiled and elevated his brows.\n\n\"He said not, at any rate,\" Grief qualified. \"He assured me,\nfurthermore, that he always succeeded on the first trial.\"\n\n\"I saw it done when I was second mate on a lime-juicer,\" Captain Ward\nspoke up. \"The old man used a caulking mallet and a steel marlin-spike.\nHe took the tooth out with the first stroke, too, clean as a whistle.\"\n\n\"Me for the forceps,\" Worth muttered grimly, inserting his own pair in\nthe mouth of the black. As he pulled, the man groaned and rose in the\nair. \"Lend a hand, somebody, and hold him down,\" the manager appealed.\n\nGrief and Wallenstein, on either side, gripped the black and held him.\nAnd he, in turn, struggled against them and clenched his teeth on the\nforceps. The group swayed back and forth. Such exertion, in the stagnant\nheat, brought the sweat out on all of them. The black sweated, too, but\nhis was the sweat of excruciating pain. The chair on which he sat was\noverturned. Captain Ward paused in the act of pouring himself a drink,\nand called encouragement. Worth pleaded with his assistants to hang\non, and hung on himself, twisting the tooth till it crackled and then\nattempting a straightaway pull.\n\nNor did any of them notice the little black man who limped up the steps\nand stood looking on. Koho was a conservative. His fathers before him\nhad worn no clothes, and neither did he, not even a gee-string. The many\nempty perforations in nose and lips and ears told of decorative passions\nlong since dead. The holes on both ear-lobes had been torn out, but\ntheir size was attested by the strips of withered flesh that hung down\nand swept his shoulders. He cared now only for utility, and in one of\nthe half dozen minor holes in his right ear he carried a short clay\npipe. Around his waist was buckled a cheap trade-belt, and between the\nimitation leather and the naked skin was thrust the naked blade of a\nlong knife. Suspended from the belt was his bamboo betel-nut and lime\nbox. In his hand was a short-barrelled, large-bore Snider rifle. He\nwas indescribably filthy, and here and there marred by scars, the worst\nbeing the one left by the Lee-Enfield bullet, which had withered the\ncalf to half the size of its mate. His shrunken mouth showed that few\nteeth were left to serve him. Face and body were shrunken and withered,\nbut his black, bead-like eyes, small and close together, were very\nbright, withal they were restless and querulous, and more like a\nmonkey's than a man's.\n\nHe looked on, grinning like a shrewd little ape. His joy in the torment\nof the patient was natural, for the world he lived in was a world of\npain. He had endured his share of it, and inflicted far more than his\nshare on others. When the tooth parted from its locked hold in the jaw\nand the forceps raked across the other teeth and out of the mouth with a\nnerve-rasping sound, old Koho's eyes fairly sparkled, and he looked\nwith glee at the poor black, collapsed on the veranda floor and groaning\nterribly as he held his head in both his hands.\n\n\"I think he's going to faint,\" Grief said, bending over the victim.\n\"Captain Ward, give him a drink, please. You'd better take one yourself,\nWorth; you're shaking like a leaf.\"\n\n\"And I think I'll take one,\" said Wallenstein, wiping the sweat from his\nface. His eye caught the shadow of Koho on the floor and followed it up\nto the old chief himself. \"Hello! who's this?\"\n\n\"Hello, Koho!\" Grief said genially, though he knew better than to offer\nto shake hands.\n\nIt was one of Koho's _tambos_, given him by the devil-devil doctors when\nhe was born, that never was his flesh to come in contact with the flesh\nof a white man. Worth and Captain Ward, of the _Wonder_, greeted Koho,\nbut Worth frowned at sight of the Snider, for it was one of his _tambos_\nthat no visiting bushman should carry a weapon on the plantation. Rifles\nhad a nasty way of going off at the hip under such circumstances. The\nmanager clapped his hands, and a black house-boy, recruited from San\nCristobal, came running. At a sign from Worth, he took the rifle from\nthe visitor's hand and carried it inside the bungalow.\n\n\"Koho,\" Grief said, introducing the German Resident, \"this big fella\nmarster belong Bougainville--my word, big fella marster too much.\"\n\nKoho, remembering the visits of the various German cruisers, smiled with\na light of unpleasant reminiscence in his eyes.\n\n\"Don't shake hands with him, Wallenstein,\" Grief warned. \"_Tambo_, you\nknow.\" Then to Koho, \"My word, you get 'm too much fat stop along you.\nBime by you marry along new fella Mary, eh?\"\n\n\"Too old fella me,\" Koho answered, with a weary shake of the head. \"Me\nno like 'm Mary. Me no like 'm _kai-kai_ (food). Close up me die along\naltogether.\" He stole a significant glance at Worth, whose head was\ntilted back to a long glass. \"Me like 'm rum.\"\n\nGrief shook his head.\n\n\"_Tambo_ along black fella.\"\n\n\"He black fella no tambo,\" Koho retorted, nodding toward the groaning\nlabourer.\n\n\"He fella sick,\" Grief explained.\n\n\"Me fella sick.\"\n\n\"You fella big liar,\" Grief laughed. \"Rum tambo, all the time tambo.\nNow, Koho, we have big fella talk along this big fella mar-ster.\"\n\nAnd he and Wallenstein and the old chief sat down on the veranda to\nconfer about affairs of state. Koho was complimented on the peace he\nhad kept, and he, with many protestations of his aged decrepitude, swore\npeace again and everlasting. Then was discussed the matter of starting a\nGerman plantation twenty miles down the coast. The land, of course, was\nto be bought from Koho, and the price was arranged in terms of tobacco,\nknives, beads, pipes, hatchets, porpoise teeth and shell-money--in terms\nof everything except rum. While the talk went on, Koho, glancing through\nthe window, could see Worth mixing medicines and placing bottles back in\nthe medicine cupboard. Also, he saw the manager complete his labours by\ntaking a drink of Scotch. Koho noted the bottle carefully. And, though\nhe hung about for an hour after the conference was over, there was never\na moment when some one or another was not in the room. When Grief and\nWorth sat down to a business talk, Koho gave it up.\n\n\"Me go along schooner,\" he announced, then turned and limped out.\n\n\"How are the mighty fallen,\" Grief laughed. \"To think that used to be\nKoho, the fiercest red-handed murderer in the Solomons, who defied all\nhis life two of the greatest world powers. And now he's going aboard to\ntry and cadge Denby for a drink.\"\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nFor the last time in his life the supercargo of the _Wonder_ perpetrated\na practical joke on a native. He was in the main cabin, checking off the\nlist of goods being landed in the whaleboats, when Koho limped down the\ncom-panionway and took a seat opposite him at the table.\n\n\"Close up me die along altogether,\" was the burden of the old chief's\nplaint. All the delights of the flesh had forsaken him. \"Me no like\n'm Mary. Me no like 'm _kai-kai_. Me too much sick fella. Me close up\nfinish.\" A long, sad pause, in which his face expressed unutterable\nconcern for his stomach, which he patted gingerly and with an assumption\nof pain. \"Belly belong me too much sick.\" Another pause, which was an\ninvitation to Denby to make suggestions. Then followed a long, weary,\nfinal sigh, and a \"Me like 'm rum.\"\n\nDenby laughed heartlessly. He had been cadged for drinks before by the\nold cannibal, and the sternest _tambo_ Grief and McTavish had laid down\nwas the one forbidding alcohol to the natives of New Gibbon.\n\nThe trouble was that Koho had acquired the taste. In his younger days\nhe had learned the delights of drunkenness when he cut off the schooner\n_Dorset_, but unfortunately he had learned it along with all his\ntribesmen, and the supply had not held out long. Later, when he led his\nnaked warriors down to the destruction of the German plantation, he was\nwiser, and he appropriated all the liquors for his sole use. The result\nhad been a gorgeous mixed drunk, on a dozen different sorts of drink,\nranging from beer doctored with quinine to absinthe and apricot brandy.\nThe drunk had lasted for months, and it had left him with a thirst that\nwould remain with him until he died. Predisposed toward alcohol, after\nthe way of savages, all the chemistry of his flesh clamoured for it.\nThis craving was to him expressed in terms of tingling and sensation, of\nmaggots crawling warmly and deliciously in his brain, of good feeling,\nand well being, and high exultation. And in his barren old age, when\nwomen and feasting were a weariness, and when old hates had smouldered\ndown, he desired more and more the revivifying fire that came liquid out\nof bottles--out of all sorts of bottles--for he remembered them well.\nHe would sit in the sun for hours, occasionally drooling, in mournful\ncontemplation of the great orgy which had been his when the German\nplantation was cleaned out.\n\nDenby was sympathetic. He sought out the old chief's symptoms and\noffered him dyspeptic tablets from the medicine chest, pills, and\na varied assortment of harmless tabloids and capsules. But Koho\nsteadfastly declined. Once, when he cut the _Dorset_ off, he had bitten\nthrough a capsule of quinine; in addition, two of his warriors had\npartaken of a white powder and laid down and died very violently in a\nvery short time. No; he did not believe in drugs. But the liquids from\nbottles, the cool-flaming youth-givers and warm-glowing dream-makers. No\nwonder the white men valued them so highly and refused to dispense them.\n\n\"Rum he good fella,\" he repeated over and over, plaintively and with the\nweary patience of age.\n\nAnd then Denby made his mistake and played his joke. Stepping around\nbehind Koho, he unlocked the medicine closet and took out a four-ounce\nbottle labelled _essence of mustard_. As he made believe to draw the\ncork and drink of the contents, in the mirror on the for'ard bulkhead he\nglimpsed Koho, twisted half around, intently watching him. Denby smacked\nhis lips and cleared his throat appreciatively as he replaced the\nbottle. Neglecting to relock the medicine closet, he returned to his\nchair, and, after a decent interval, went on deck. He stood beside the\ncompanionway and listened. After several moments the silence below was\nbroken by a fearful, wheezing, propulsive, strangling cough. He smiled\nto himself and returned leisurely down the companionway. The bottle was\nback on the shelf where it belonged, and the old man sat in the same\nposition. Denby marvelled at his iron control. Mouth and lips and\ntongue, and all sensitive membranes, were a blaze of fire. He gasped\nand nearly coughed several times, while involuntary tears brimmed in\nhis eyes and ran down his cheeks. An ordinary man would have coughed and\nstrangled for half an hour. But old Koho's face was grimly composed. It\ndawned on him that a trick had been played, and into his eyes came an\nexpression of hatred and malignancy so primitive, so abysmal, that it\nsent the chills up and down Denby's spine. Koho arose proudly.\n\n\"Me go along,\" he said. \"You sing out one fella boat stop along me.\"\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nHaving seen Grief and Worth start for a ride over the plantation,\nWallenstein sat down in the big living-room and with gun-oil and old\nrags proceeded to take apart and clean his automatic pistol. On the\ntable beside him stood the inevitable bottle of Scotch and numerous soda\nbottles. Another bottle, part full, chanced to stand there. It was also\nlabelled Scotch, but its content was liniment which Worth had mixed for\nthe horses and neglected to put away.\n\nAs Wallenstein worked, he glanced through the window and saw Koho coming\nup the compound path. He was limping very rapidly, but when he came\nalong the veranda and entered the room his gait was slow and dignified.\nHe sat down and watched the gun-cleaning, Though mouth and lips and\ntongue were afire, he gave no sign. At the end of five minutes he spoke.\n\n\"Rum he good fella. Me like 'm rum.\" Wallenstein smiled and shook his\nhead, and then it was that his perverse imp suggested what was to be his\nlast joke on a native. The similarity of the two bottles was the real\nsuggestion. He laid his pistol parts on the table and mixed himself\na long drink. Standing as he did between Koho and the table, he\ninterchanged the two bottles, drained his glass, made as if to search\nfor something, and left the room. From outside he heard the surprised\nsplutter and cough; but when he returned the old chief sat as before.\nThe liniment in the bottle, however, was lower, and it still oscillated.\n\nKoho stood up, clapped his hands, and, when the house-boy answered,\nsigned that he desired his rifle. The boy fetched the weapon, and\naccording to custom preceded the visitor down the pathway. Not\nuntil outside the gate did the boy turn the rifle over to its owner.\nWallenstein, chuckling to himself, watched the old chief limp along the\nbeach in the direction of the river.\n\nA few minutes later, as he put his pistol together, Wallenstein heard\nthe distant report of a gun. For the instant he thought of Koho, then\ndismissed the conjecture from his mind. Worth and Grief had taken\nshotguns with them, and it was probably one of their shots at a pigeon.\nWallenstein lounged back in his chair, chuckled, twisted his yellow\nmustache, and dozed. He was aroused by the excited voice of Worth,\ncrying out:\n\n\"Ring the big fella bell! Ring plenty too much! Ring like hell!\"\n\nWallenstein gained the veranda in time to see the manager jump his horse\nover the low fence of the compound and dash down the beach after Grief,\nwho was riding madly ahead. A loud crackling and smoke rising through\nthe cocoanut trees told the story. The boat-houses and the barracks\nwere on fire. The big plantation bell was ringing wildly as the German\nResident ran down the beach, and he could see whaleboats hastily putting\noff from the schooner.\n\nBarracks and boat-houses, grass-thatched and like tinder, were wrapped\nin flames. Grief emerged from the kitchen, carrying a naked black child\nby the leg. Its head was missing.\n\n\"The cook's in there,\" he told Worth. \"Her head's gone, too. She was too\nheavy, and I had to clear out.\"\n\n\"It was my fault,\" Wallenstein said. \"Old Koho did it. But I let him\ntake a drink of Worth's horse liniment.\"\n\n\"I guess he's headed for the bush,\" Worth said, springing astride his\nhorse and starting. \"Oliver is down there by the river. Hope he didn't\nget _him_.\"\n\nThe manager galloped away through the trees. A few minutes later, as\nthe charred wreck of the barracks crashed in, they heard him calling and\nfollowed. On the edge of the river bank they came upon him. He still sat\non his horse, very white-faced, and gazed at something on the ground. It\nwas the body of Oliver, the young assistant manager, though it was hard\nto realize it, for the head was gone. The black labourers, breathless\nfrom their run in from the fields, were now crowding around, and under\nconches to-night, and the war-drums, \"all merry hell will break loose.\nThey won't rush us, but keep all the boys close up to the house, Mr.\nWorth. Come on!\"\n\nAs they returned along the path they came upon a black who whimpered and\ncried vociferously.\n\n\"Shut up mouth belong you!\" Worth shouted. \"What name you make 'm\nnoise?\"\n\n\"Him fella Koho finish along two fella bulla-macow,\" the black answered,\ndrawing a forefinger significantly across his throat.\n\n\"He's knifed the cows,\" Grief said. \"That means no more milk for some\ntime for you, Worth. I'll see about sending a couple up from Ugi.\"\n\nWallenstein proved inconsolable, until Denby, coming ashore, confessed\nto the dose of essence of mustard. Thereat the German Resident became\neven cheerful, though he twisted his yellow mustache up more fiercely\nand continued to curse the Solomons with oaths culled from four\nlanguages.\n\nNext morning, visible from the masthead of the _Wonder_, the bush\nwas alive with signal-smokes. From promontory to promontory, and back\nthrough the solid jungle, the smoke-pillars curled and puffed and\ntalked. Remote villages on the higher peaks, beyond the farthest raids\nMcTavish had ever driven, joined in the troubled conversation. From\nacross the river persisted a bedlam of conches; while from everywhere,\ndrifting for miles along the quiet air, came the deep, booming\nreverberations of the great war-drums--huge tree trunks, hollowed by\nfire and carved with tools of stone and shell. \"You're all right as long\nas you stay close,\" Grief told his manager. \"I've got to get along\nto Guvutu. They won't come out in the open and attack you. Keep the\nwork-gangs close. Stop the clearing till this blows over. They'll get\nany detached gangs you send out. And, whatever you do, don't be fooled\ninto going into the bush after Koho. If you do, he'll get you. All\nyou've got to do is wait for McTavish. I'll send him up with a bunch of\nhis Malaita bush-men. He's the only man who can go inside. Also, until\nhe comes, I'll leave Denby with you. You don't mind, do you, Mr. Denby?\nI'll send McTavish up with the _Wanda_, and you can go back on her and\nrejoin the _Wonder_. Captain Ward can manage without you for a trip.\"\n\n\"It was just what I was going to volunteer,\" Denby answered. \"I never\ndreamed all this muss would be kicked up over a joke. You see, in a way\nI consider myself responsible for it.\"\n\n\"So am I responsible,\" Wallenstein broke in.\n\n\"But I started it,\" the supercargo urged.\n\n\"Maybe you did, but I carried it along.\"\n\n\"And Koho finished it,\" Grief said.\n\n\"At any rate, I, too, shall remain,\" said the German.\n\n\"I thought you were coming to Guvutu with me,\" Grief protested.\n\n\"I was. But this is my jurisdiction, partly, and I have made a fool of\nmyself in it completely. I shall remain and help get things straight\nagain.\"\n\nAt Guvutu, Grief sent full instructions to McTavish by a recruiting\nketch which was just starting for Malaita. Captain Ward sailed in the\n_Wonder_ for the Santa Cruz Islands; and Grief, borrowing a whaleboat\nand a crew of black prisoners from the British Resident, crossed the\nchannel to Guadalcanar, to examine the grass lands back of Penduffryn.\n\nThree weeks later, with a free sheet and a lusty breeze, he threaded the\ncoral patches and surged up the smooth water to Guvutu anchorage. The\nharbour was deserted, save for a small ketch which lay close in to the\nshore reef. Grief recognized it as the _Wanda_. She had evidently just\ngot in by the Tulagi Passage, for her black crew was still at work\nfurling the sails. As he rounded alongside, McTavish himself extended a\nhand to help him over the rail.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" Grief asked. \"Haven't you started yet?\"\n\nMcTavish nodded. \"And got back. Everything's all right on board.\"\n\n\"How's New Gibbon?\"\n\n\"All there, the last I saw of it, barrin' a few inconsequential frills\nthat a good eye could make out lacking from the landscape.\"\n\nHe was a cold flame of a man, small as Koho, and as dried up, with a\nmahogany complexion and small, expressionless blue eyes that were more\nlike gimlet-points than the eyes of a Scotchman. Without fear, without\nenthusiasm, impervious to disease and climate and sentiment, he was lean\nand bitter and deadly as a snake. That his present sour look boded ill\nnews, Grief was well aware.\n\n\"Spit it out!\" he said. \"What's happened?\"\n\n\"'Tis a thing severely to be condemned, a damned shame, this joking with\nheathen niggers,\" was the reply. \"Also, 'tis very expensive. Come below,\nMr. Grief. You'll be better for the information with a long glass in\nyour hand. After you.\"\n\n\"How did you settle things?\" his employer demanded as soon as they were\nseated in the cabin.\n\nThe little Scotchman shook his head. \"There was nothing to settle. It\nall depends how you look at it. The other way would be to say it was\nsettled, entirely settled, mind you, before I got there.\"\n\n\"But the plantation, man? The plantation?\"\n\n\"No plantation. All the years of our work have gone for naught. 'Tis\nback where we started, where the missionaries started, where the Germans\nstarted--and where they finished. Not a stone stands on another at the\nlanding pier. The houses are black ashes. Every tree is hacked down, and\nthe wild pigs are rooting out the yams and sweet potatoes. Those boys\nfrom New Georgia, a fine bunch they were, five score of them, and they\ncost you a pretty penny. Not one is left to tell the tale.\"\n\nHe paused and began fumbling in a large locker under the\ncompanion-steps.\n\n\"But Worth? And Denby? And Wallenstein?\"\n\n\"That's what I'm telling you. Take a look.\"\n\nMcTavish dragged out a sack made of rice matting and emptied its\ncontents on the floor. David Grief pulled himself together with a jerk,\nfor he found himself gazing fascinated at the heads of the three men he\nhad left at New Gibbon. The yellow mustache of Wallenstein had lost its\nfierce curl and drooped and wilted on the upper lip.\n\n\"I don't know how it happened,\" the Scotchman's voice went on drearily.\n\"But I surmise they went into the bush after the old devil.\"\n\n\"And where is Koho?\" Grief asked.\n\n\"Back in the bush and drunk as a lord. That's how I was able to recover\nthe heads. He was too drunk to stand. They lugged him on their backs out\nof the village when I rushed it. And if you'll relieve me of the heads,\nI'll be well obliged.\" He paused and sighed. \"I suppose they'll have\nregular funerals over them and put them in the ground. But in my way of\nthinking they'd make excellent curios. Any respectable museum would pay\na hundred quid apiece. Better have another drink. You're looking a bit\npale---- There, put that down you, and if you'll take my advice, Mr.\nGrief, I would say, set your face sternly against any joking with\nthe niggers. It always makes trouble, and it is a very expensive\ndivertisement.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Five--A LITTLE ACCOUNT WITH SWITHIN HALL\n\n\n\n\nI\n\nWith a last long scrutiny at the unbroken circle of the sea, David Grief\nswung out of the cross-trees and slowly and dejectedly descended the\nratlines to the deck.\n\n\"Leu-Leu Atoll is sunk, Mr. Snow,\" he said to the anxious-faced young\nmate. \"If there is anything in navigation, the atoll is surely under the\nsea, for we've sailed clear over it twice--or the spot where it ought to\nbe. It's either that or the chronometer's gone wrong, or I've forgotten\nmy navigation.\"\n\n\"It must be the chronometer, sir,\" the mate reassured his owner. \"You\nknow I made separate sights and worked them up, and that they agreed\nwith yours.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Grief muttered, nodding glumly, \"and where your Summer lines\ncrossed, and mine, too, was the dead centre of Leu-Leu Atoll. It must be\nthe chronometer--slipped a cog or something.\"\n\nHe made a short pace to the rail and back, and cast a troubled eye at\nthe _Uncle Toby's_ wake. The schooner, with a fairly strong breeze on\nher quarter, was logging nine or ten knots.\n\n\"Better bring her up on the wind, Mr. Snow. Put her under easy sail and\nlet her work to windward on two-hour legs. It's thickening up, and I\ndon't imagine we can get a star observation to-night; so we'll just hold\nour weather position, get a latitude sight to-morrow, and run Leu-Leu\ndown on her own latitude. That's the way all the old navigators did.\"\n\nBroad of beam, heavily sparred, with high freeboard and bluff, Dutchy\nbow, the _Uncle Toby_ was the slowest, tubbiest, safest, and most\nfool-proof schooner David Grief possessed. Her run was in the Banks and\nSanta Cruz groups and to the northwest among the several isolated atolls\nwhere his native traders collected copra, hawksbill turtle, and\nan occasional ton of pearl shell. Finding the skipper down with a\nparticularly bad stroke of fever, Grief had relieved him and taken the\n_Uncle Toby_ on her semiannual run to the atolls. He had elected to make\nhis first call at Leu-Leu, which lay farthest, and now found himself\nlost at sea with a chronometer that played tricks.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nNo stars showed that night, nor was the sun visible next day. A stuffy,\nsticky calm obtained, broken by big wind-squalls and heavy downpours.\nFrom fear of working too far to windward, the Uncle Toby was hove to,\nand four days and nights of cloud-hidden sky followed. Never did the sun\nappear, and on the several occasions that stars broke through they were\ntoo dim and fleeting for identification. By this time it was patent to\nthe veriest tyro that the elements were preparing to break loose. Grief,\ncoming on deck from consulting the barometer, which steadfastly remained\nat 29.90, encountered Jackie-Jackie, whose face was as brooding\nand troublous as the sky and air. Jackie-Jackie, a Tongan sailor of\nexperience, served as a sort of bosun and semi-second mate over the\nmixed Kanaka crew.\n\n\"Big weather he come, I think,\" he said. \"I see him just the same before\nmaybe five, six times.\"\n\nGrief nodded. \"Hurricane weather, all right, Jackie-Jackie. Pretty soon\nbarometer go down--bottom fall out.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" the Tongan concurred. \"He goin' to blow like hell.\"\n\nTen minutes later Snow came on deck.\n\n\"She's started,\" he said; \"29.85, going down and pumping at the same\ntime. It's stinking hot--don't you notice it?\" He brushed his forehead\nwith his hands. \"It's sickening. I could lose my breakfast without\ntrying.\"\n\nJackie-Jackie grinned. \"Just the same me. Everything inside walk about.\nAlways this way before big blow. But _Uncle Toby_ all right. He go\nthrough anything.\"\n\n\"Better rig that storm-trysail on the main, and a storm-jib,\" Grief said\nto the mate. \"And put all the reefs into the working canvas before you\nfurl down. No telling what we may need. Put on double gaskets while\nyou're about it.\"\n\nIn another hour, the sultry oppressiveness steadily increasing and the\nstark calm still continuing, the barometer had fallen to 29.70. The\nmate, being young, lacked the patience of waiting for the portentous. He\nceased his restless pacing, and waved his arms.\n\n\"If she's going to come let her come!\" he cried. \"There's no use\nshilly-shallying this way! Whatever the worst is, let us know it and\nhave it! A pretty pickle--lost with a crazy chronometer and a hurricane\nthat won't blow!\"\n\nThe cloud-mussed sky turned to a vague copper colour, and seemed to\nglow as the inside of a huge heated caldron. Nobody remained below. The\nnative sailors formed in anxious groups amidships and for'ard, where\nthey talked in low voices and gazed apprehensively at the ominous\nsky and the equally ominous sea that breathed in long, low, oily\nundulations.\n\n\"Looks like petroleum mixed with castor oil,\" the mate grumbled, as he\nspat his disgust overside. \"My mother used to dose me with messes like\nthat when I was a kid. Lord, she's getting black!\"\n\nThe lurid coppery glow had vanished, and the sky thickened and lowered\nuntil the darkness was as that of a late twilight. David Grief, who\nwell knew the hurricane rules, nevertheless reread the \"Laws of Storms,\"\nscrewing his eyes in the faint light in order to see the print. There\nwas nothing to be done save wait for the wind, so that he might know\nhow he lay in relation to the fast-flying and deadly centre that from\nsomewhere was approaching out of the gloom.\n\nIt was three in the afternoon, and the glass had sunk to 29:45, when\nthe wind came. They could see it on the water, darkening the face of the\nsea, crisping tiny whitecaps as it rushed along. It was merely a stiff\nbreeze, and the _Uncle Toby_, filling away under her storm canvas till\nthe wind was abeam, sloshed along at a four-knot gait.\n\n\"No weight to that,\" Snow sneered. \"And after such grand preparation!\"\n\n\"Pickaninny wind,\" Jackie-Jackie agreed. \"He grow big man pretty quick,\nyou see.\"\n\nGrief ordered the foresail put on, retaining the reefs, and the _Uncle\nToby_ mended her pace in the rising breeze. The wind quickly grew to\nman's size, but did not stop there. It merely blew hard, and harder, and\nkept on blowing harder, advertising each increase by lulls followed by\nfierce, freshening gusts. Ever it grew, until the _Uncle Toby's_ rail\nwas more often pressed under than not, while her waist boiled with\nfoaming water which the scuppers could not carry off. Grief studied the\nbarometer, still steadily falling.\n\n\"The centre is to the southward,\" he told Snow, \"and we're running\nacross its path and into it. Now we'll turn about and run the other way.\nThat ought to bring the glass up. Take in the foresail--it's more than\nshe can carry already--and stand by to wear her around.\"\n\nThe maneuver was accomplished, and through the gloom that was almost\nthat of the first darkness of evening the _Uncle Toby_ turned and raced\nmadly north across the face of the storm.\n\n\"It's nip and tuck,\" Grief confided to the mate a couple of hours\nlater. \"The storm's swinging a big curve--there's no calculating that\ncurve--and we may win across or the centre may catch us. Thank the Lord,\nthe glass is holding its own. It all depends on how big the curve is.\nThe sea's too big for us to keep on. Heave her to! She'll keep working\nalong out anyway.\"\n\n\"I thought I knew what wind was,\" Snow shouted in his owner's ear next\nmorning. \"This isn't wind. It's something unthinkable. It's impossible.\nIt must reach ninety or a hundred miles an hour in the gusts. That don't\nmean anything. How could I ever tell it to anybody? I couldn't. And look\nat that sea! I've run my Easting down, but I never saw anything like\nthat.\"\n\nDay had come, and the sun should have been up an hour, yet the best\nit could produce was a sombre semi-twilight. The ocean was a stately\nprocession of moving mountains. A third of a mile across yawned the\nvalleys between the great waves. Their long slopes, shielded somewhat\nfrom the full fury of the wind, were broken by systems of smaller\nwhitecapping waves, but from the high crests of the big waves themselves\nthe wind tore the whitecaps in the forming. This spume drove masthead\nhigh, and higher, horizontally, above the surface of the sea.\n\n\"We're through the worst,\" was Grief's judgment. \"The glass is coming\nalong all the time. The sea will get bigger as the wind eases down. I'm\ngoing to turn in. Watch for shifts in the wind. They'll be sure to come.\nCall me at eight bells.\"\n\nBy mid-afternoon, in a huge sea, with the wind after its last shift no\nmore than a stiff breeze, the Tongan bosun sighted a schooner bottom\nup. The _Uncle Toby's_ drift took them across the bow and they could\nnot make out the name; but before night they picked up with a small,\nround-bottom, double-ender boat, swamped but with white lettering\nvisible on its bow. Through the binoculars, Gray made out: _Emily L No.\n3_.\n\n\"A sealing schooner,\" Grief said. \"But what a sealer's doing in these\nwaters is beyond me.\"\n\n\"Treasure-hunters, maybe?\" Snow speculated. \"The _Sophie Sutherland_ and\nthe _Herman_ were sealers, you remember, chartered out of San Francisco\nby the chaps with the maps who can always go right to the spot until\nthey get there and don't.\"\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nAfter a giddy night of grand and lofty tumbling, in which, over a big\nand dying sea, without a breath of wind to steady her, the Uncle Toby\nrolled every person on board sick of soul, a light breeze sprang up\nand the reefs were shaken out. By midday, on a smooth ocean floor, the\nclouds thinned and cleared and sights of the sun were obtained. Two\ndegrees and fifteen minutes south, the observation gave them. With a\nbroken chronometer longitude was out of the question.\n\n\"We're anywhere within five hundred and a thousand miles along that\nlatitude line,\" Grief remarked, as he and the mate bent over the chart.\n\n\"Leu-Leu is to the south'ard somewhere, and this section of ocean is all\nblank. There is neither an island nor a reef by which we can regulate\nthe chronometer. The only thing to do--\"\n\n\"Land ho, skipper!\" the Tongan called down the companionway.\n\nGrief took a quick glance at the empty blank of the chart, whistled his\nsurprise, and sank back feebly in a chair.\n\n\"It gets me,\" he said. \"There can't be land around here. We never\ndrifted or ran like that. The whole voyage has been crazy. Will you\nkindly go up, Mr. Snow, and see what's ailing Jackie.\"\n\n\"It's land all right,\" the mate called down a minute afterward. \"You can\nsee it from the deck--tops of cocoanuts--an atoll of some sort. Maybe\nit's Leu-Leu after all.\"\n\nGrief shook his head positively as he gazed at the fringe of palms, only\nthe tops visible, apparently rising out of the sea.\n\n\"Haul up on the wind, Mr. Snow, close-and-by, and we'll take a look.\nWe can just reach past to the south, and if it spreads off in that\ndirection we'll hit the southwest corner.\"\n\nVery near must palms be to be seen from the low deck of a schooner, and,\nslowly as the _Uncle Toby_ sailed, she quickly raised the low land above\nthe sea, while more palms increased the definition of the atoll circle.\n\n\"She's a beauty,\" the mate remarked. \"A perfect circle.... Looks as if\nit might be eight or nine miles across.... Wonder if there's an entrance\nto the lagoon.... Who knows? Maybe it's a brand new find.\"\n\nThey coasted up the west side of the atoll, making short tacks in to\nthe surf-pounded coral rock and out again. From the masthead, across\nthe palm-fringe, a Kanaka announced the lagoon and a small island in the\nmiddle.\n\n\"I know what you're thinking,\" Grief said to his mate.\n\nSnow, who had been muttering and shaking his head, looked up with quick\nand challenging incredulity.\n\n\"You're thinking the entrance will be on the northwest.\" Grief went on,\nas if reciting.\n\n\"Two cable lengths wide, marked on the north by three separated\ncocoanuts, and on the south by pandanus trees. Eight miles in diameter,\na perfect circle, with an island in the dead centre.\"\n\n\"I _was_ thinking that,\" Snow acknowledged.\n\n\"And there's the entrance opening up just where it ought to be----\"\n\n\"And the three palms,\" Snow almost whispered, \"and the pandanus trees.\nIf there's a windmill on the island, it's it--Swithin Hall's island. But\nit can't be. Everybody's been looking for it for the last ten years.\"\n\n\"Hall played you a dirty trick once, didn't he?\" Grief queried.\n\nSnow nodded. \"That's why I'm working for you. He broke me flat. It was\ndownright robbery. I bought the wreck of the _Cascade_, down in Sydney,\nout of a first instalment of a legacy from home.\"\n\n\"She went on Christmas Island, didn't she?\"\n\n\"Yes, full tilt, high and dry, in the night. They saved the passengers\nand mails. Then I bought a little island schooner, which took the rest\nof my money, and I had to wait the final payment by the executors to fit\nher out. What did Swithin Hall do--he was at Honolulu at the time--but\nmake a straightaway run for Christmas Island. Neither right nor title\ndid he have. When I got there, the hull and engines were all that was\nleft of the _Cascade_. She had had a fair shipment of silk on board,\ntoo. And it wasn't even damaged. I got it afterward pretty straight from\nhis supercargo. He cleared something like sixty thousand dollars.\"\n\nSnow shrugged his shoulders and gazed bleakly at the smooth surface of\nthe lagoon, where tiny wavelets danced in the afternoon sun.\n\n\"The wreck was mine. I bought her at public auction. I'd gambled big,\nand I'd lost. When I got back to Sydney, the crew, and some of the\ntradesmen who'd extended me credit, libelled the schooner. I pawned\nmy watch and sextant, and shovelled coal one spell, and finally got a\nbillet in the New Hebrides on a screw of eight pounds a month. Then I\ntried my luck as independent trader, went broke, took a mate's billet on\na recruiter down to Tanna and over to Fiji, got a job as overseer on a\nGerman plantation back of Apia, and finally settled down on the _Uncle\nToby_.\"\n\n\"Have you ever met Swithin Hall?\"\n\nSnow shook his head.\n\n\"Well, you're likely to meet him now. There's the windmill.\"\n\nIn the centre of the lagoon, as they emerged from the passage, they\nopened a small, densely wooded island, among the trees of which a large\nDutch windmill showed plainly.\n\n\"Nobody at home from the looks of it,\" Grief said, \"or you might have a\nchance to collect.\"\n\nThe mate's face set vindictively, and his fists clenched.\n\n\"Can't touch him legally. He's got too much money now. But I can take\nsixty thousand dollars' worth out of his hide. I hope he is at home.\"\n\n\"Then I hope he is, too,\" Grief said, with an appreciative smile. \"You\ngot the description of his island from Bau-Oti, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Yes, as pretty well everybody else has. The trouble is that Bau-Oti\ncan't give latitude or longitude. Says they sailed a long way from the\nGilberts--that's all he knows. I wonder what became of him.\"\n\n\"I saw him a year ago on the beach at Tahiti. Said he was thinking about\nshipping for a cruise through the Paumotus. Well, here we are, getting\nclose in. Heave the lead, Jackie-Jackie. Stand by to let go, Mr. Snow.\nAccording to Bau-Oti, anchorage three hundred yards off the west shore\nin nine fathoms, coral patches to the southeast. There are the patches.\nWhat do you get, Jackie?\"\n\n\"Nine fadom.\"\n\n\"Let go, Mr. Snow.\"\n\nThe _Uncle Toby_ swung to her chain, head-sails ran down, and the Kanaka\ncrew sprang to fore and main-halyards and sheets.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nThe whaleboat laid alongside the small, coral-stone landing-pier, and\nDavid Grief and his mate stepped ashore.\n\n\"You'd think the place deserted,\" Grief said, as they walked up a sanded\npath to the bungalow. \"But I smell a smell that I've often smelled.\nSomething doing, or my nose is a liar. The lagoon is carpeted with\nshell. They're rotting the meat out not a thousand miles away. Get that\nwhiff?\"\n\nLike no bungalow in the tropics was this bungalow of Swithin Hall. Of\nmission architecture, when they had entered through the unlatched screen\ndoor they found decoration and furniture of the same mission style. The\nfloor of the big living-room was covered with the finest Samoan mats.\nThere were couches, window seats, cozy corners, and a billiard table. A\nsewing table, and a sewing-basket, spilling over with sheer linen in the\nFrench embroidery of which stuck a needle, tokened a woman's presence.\nBy screen and veranda the blinding sunshine was subdued to a cool, dim\nradiance. The sheen of pearl push-buttons caught Grief's eye.\n\n\"Storage batteries, by George, run by the windmill!\" he exclaimed as he\npressed the buttons. \"And concealed lighting!\"\n\nHidden bowls glowed, and the room was filled with diffused golden light.\nMany shelves of books lined the walls. Grief fell to running over\ntheir titles. A fairly well-read man himself, for a sea-adventurer, he\nglimpsed a wide-ness of range and catholicity of taste that were beyond\nhim. Old friends he met, and others that he had heard of but never read.\nThere were complete sets of Tolstoy, Turgenieff, and Gorky; of Cooper\nand Mark Twain; of Hugo, and Zola, and Sue; and of Flaubert, De\nMaupassant, and Paul de Koch. He glanced curiously at the pages of\nMetchnikoff, Weininger, and Schopenhauer, and wonderingly at those\nof Ellis, Lydston, Krafft-Ebbing, and Forel. Woodruff's \"Expansion of\nRaces\" was in his hands when Snow returned from further exploration of\nthe house.\n\n\"Enamelled bath-tub, separate room for a shower, and a sitz-bath!\" he\nexclaimed. \"Fitted up for a king! And I reckon some of my money went to\npay for it. The place must be occupied. I found fresh-opened butter and\nmilk tins in the pantry, and fresh turtle-meat hanging up. I'm going to\nsee what else I can find.\"\n\nGrief, too, departed, through a door that led out of the opposite end\nof the living-room. He found himself in a self-evident woman's bedroom.\nAcross it, he peered through a wire-mesh door into a screened and\ndarkened sleeping porch. On a couch lay a woman asleep. In the soft\nlight she seemed remarkably beautiful in a dark Spanish way. By her\nside, opened and face downward, a novel lay on a chair. From the\ncolour in her cheeks, Grief concluded that she had not been long in the\ntropics. After the one glimpse he stole softly back, in time to see Snow\nentering the living-room through the other door. By the naked arm he was\nclutching an age-wrinkled black who grinned in fear and made signs of\ndumbness.\n\n\"I found him snoozing in a little kennel out back,\" the mate said. \"He's\nthe cook, I suppose. Can't get a word out of him. What did you find?\"\n\n\"A sleeping princess. S-sh! There's somebody now.\"\n\n\"If it's Hall,\" Snow muttered, clenching his fist.\n\nGrief shook his head. \"No rough-house. There's a woman here. And if it\nis Hall, before we go I'll maneuver a chance for you to get action.\"\n\nThe door opened, and a large, heavily built man entered. In his belt was\na heavy, long-barrelled Colt's. One quick, anxious look he gave them,\nthen his face wreathed in a genial smile and his hand was extended.\n\n\"Welcome, strangers. But if you don't mind my asking, how, by all that's\nsacred, did you ever manage to find my island?\"\n\n\"Because we were out of our course,\" Grief answered, shaking hands.\n\n\"My name's Hall, Swithin Hall,\" the other said, turning to shake Snow's\nhand. \"And I don't mind telling you that you're the first visitors I've\never had.\"\n\n\"And this is your secret island that's had all the beaches talking for\nyears?\" Grief answered. \"Well, I know the formula now for finding it.\"\n\n\"How's that?\" Hall asked quickly.\n\n\"Smash your chronometer, get mixed up with a hurricane, and then keep\nyour eyes open for cocoanuts rising out of the sea.\"\n\n\"And what is your name?\" Hall asked, after he had laughed perfunctorily.\n\n\"Anstey--Phil Anstey,\" Grief answered promptly. \"Bound on the _Uncle\nToby_ from the Gilberts to New Guinea, and trying to find my longitude.\nThis is my mate, Mr. Gray, a better navigator than I, but who has lost\nhis goat just the same to the chronometer.\"\n\nGrief did not know his reason for lying, but he had felt the prompting\nand succumbed to it. He vaguely divined that something was wrong, but\ncould not place his finger on it. Swithin Hall was a fat, round-faced\nman, with a laughing lip and laughter-wrinkles in the corners of his\neyes. But Grief, in his early youth, had learned how deceptive this type\ncould prove, as well as the deceptiveness of blue eyes that screened the\nsurface with fun and hid what went on behind.\n\n\"What are you doing with my cook?--lost yours and trying to shanghai\nhim?\" Hall was saying. \"You'd better let him go, if you're going to have\nany supper. My wife's here, and she'll be glad to meet you--dinner, she\ncalls it, and calls me down for misnaming it, but I'm old fashioned. My\nfolks always ate dinner in the middle of the day. Can't get over early\ntraining. Don't you want to wash up? I do. Look at me. I've been working\nlike a dog--out with the diving crew--shell, you know. But of course you\nsmelt it.\"\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nSnow pleaded charge of the schooner, and went on board. In addition to\nhis repugnance at breaking salt with the man who had robbed him, it was\nnecessary for him to impress the in-violableness of Grief's lies on the\nKanaka crew. By eleven o'clock Grief came on board, to find his mate\nwaiting up for him.\n\n\"There's something doing on Swithin Hall's island,\" Grief said, shaking\nhis head. \"I can't make out what it is, but I get the feel of it. What\ndoes Swithin Hall look like?\"\n\nSnow shook his head.\n\n\"That man ashore there never bought the books on the shelves,\" Grief\ndeclared with conviction. \"Nor did he ever go in for concealed lighting.\nHe's got a surface flow of suavity, but he's rough as a hoof-rasp\nunderneath. He's an oily bluff. And the bunch he's got with him--Watson\nand Gorman their names are; they came in after you left--real sea-dogs,\nmiddle-aged, marred and battered, tough as rusty wrought-iron nails and\ntwice as dangerous; real ugly customers, with guns in their belts, who\ndon't strike me as just the right sort to be on such comradely terms\nwith Swithin Hall. And the woman! She's a lady. I mean it. She knows a\nwhole lot of South America, and of China, too. I'm sure she's Spanish,\nthough her English is natural. She's travelled. We talked bull-fights.\nShe's seen them in Guayaquil, in Mexico, in Seville. She knows a lot\nabout sealskins.\n\n\"Now here's what bothers me. She knows music. I asked her if she played.\nAnd he's fixed that place up like a palace. That being so, why hasn't\nhe a piano for her? Another thing: she's quick and lively and he watches\nher whenever she talks. He's on pins and needles, and continually\nbreaking in and leading the conversation. Say, did you ever hear that\nSwithin Hall was married?\"\n\n\"Bless me, I don't know,\" the mate replied. \"Never entered my head to\nthink about it.\"\n\n\"He introduced her as Mrs. Hall. And Watson and Gorman call him Hall.\nThey're a precious pair, those two men. I don't understand it at all.\"\n\n\"What are you going to do about it?\" Snow asked.\n\n\"Oh, hang around a while. There are some books ashore there I want to\nread. Suppose you send that topmast down in the morning and generally\noverhaul. We've been through a hurricane, you know. Set up the rigging\nwhile you're about it. Get things pretty well adrift, and take your\ntime.\"\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\nThe next day Grief's suspicions found further food. Ashore early,\nhe strolled across the little island to the barracks occupied by the\ndivers.\n\nThey were just boarding the boats when he arrived, and it struck him\nthat for Kanakas they behaved more like chain-gang prisoners. The three\nwhite men were there, and Grief noted that each carried a rifle. Hall\ngreeted him jovially enough, but Gorman and Watson scowled as they\ngrunted curt good mornings.\n\nA moment afterward one of the Kanakas, as he bent to place his oar,\nfavoured Grief with a slow, deliberate wink. The man's face was\nfamiliar, one of the thousands of native sailors and divers he had\nencountered drifting about in the island trade.\n\n\"Don't tell them who I am,\" Grief said, in Tahitian. \"Did you ever sail\nfor me?\"\n\nThe man's head nodded and his mouth opened, but before he could speak\nhe was suppressed by a savage \"Shut up!\" from Watson, who was already in\nthe sternsheets.\n\n\"I beg pardon,\" Grief said. \"I ought to have known better.\"\n\n\"That's all right,\" Hall interposed. \"The trouble is they're too much\ntalk and not enough work. Have to be severe with them, or they wouldn't\nget enough shell to pay their grub.\"\n\nGrief nodded sympathetically. \"I know them. Got a crew of them\nmyself--the lazy swine. Got to drive them like niggers to get a\nhalf-day's work out of them.\"\n\n\"What was you sayin' to him?\" Gorman blurted in bluntly.\n\n\"I was asking how the shell was, and how deep they were diving.\"\n\n\"Thick,\" Hall took over the answering. \"We're working now in about ten\nfathom. It's right out there, not a hundred yards off. Want to come\nalong?\"\n\nHalf the day Grief spent with the boats, and had lunch in the bungalow.\nIn the afternoon he loafed, taking a siesta in the big living-room,\nreading some, and talking for half an hour with Mrs. Hall. After dinner,\nhe played billiards with her husband. It chanced that Grief had never\nbefore encountered Swithin Hall, yet the latter's fame as an expert at\nbilliards was the talk of the beaches from Levuka to Honolulu. But the\nman Grief played with this night proved most indifferent at the game.\nHis wife showed herself far cleverer with the cue.\n\nWhen he went on board the _Uncle Toby_ Grief routed Jackie-Jackie out of\nbed. He described the location of the barracks, and told the Tongan\nto swim softly around and have talk with the Kanakas. In two hours\nJackie-Jackie was back. He shook his head as he stood dripping before\nGrief.\n\n\"Very funny t'ing,\" he reported. \"One white man stop all the time. He\nhas big rifle. He lay in water and watch. Maybe twelve o'clock, other\nwhite man come and take rifle. First white man go to bed. Other man stop\nnow with rifle. No good. Me cannot talk with Kanakas. Me come back.\"\n\n\"By George!\" Grief said to Snow, after the Tongan had gone back to his\nbunk. \"I smell something more than shell. Those three men are standing\nwatches over their Kanakas. That man's no more Swithin Hall than I am.\"\n\nSnow whistled from the impact of a new idea.\n\n\"I've got it!\" he cried.\n\n\"And I'll name it,\" Grief retorted, \"It's in your mind that the _Emily\nL._ was their schooner?\"\n\n\"Just that. They're raising and rotting the shell, while she's gone for\nmore divers, or provisions, or both.\"\n\n\"And I agree with you.\" Grief glanced at the cabin clock and evinced\nsigns of bed-going. \"He's a sailor. The three of them are. But they're\nnot island men. They're new in these waters.\"\n\nAgain Snow whistled.\n\n\"And the _Emily L._ is lost with all hands,\" he said. \"We know that.\nThey're marooned here till Swithin Hall comes. Then he'll catch them\nwith all the shell.\"\n\n\"Or they'll take possession of his schooner.\"\n\n\"Hope they do!\" Snow muttered vindictively. \"Somebody ought to rob him.\nWish I was in their boots. I'd balance off that sixty thousand.\"\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\nA week passed, during which time the _Uncle Toby_ was ready for sea,\nwhile Grief managed to allay any suspicion of him by the shore crowd.\n\nEven Gorman and Watson accepted him at his self-description. Throughout\nthe week Grief begged and badgered them for the longitude of the island.\n\n\"You wouldn't have me leave here lost,\" he finally urged. \"I can't get a\nline on my chronometer without your longitude.\"\n\nHall laughingly refused.\n\n\"You're too good a navigator, Mr. Anstey, not to fetch New Guinea or\nsome other high land.\"\n\n\"And you're too good a navigator, Mr. Hall,\" Grief replied, \"not to know\nthat I can fetch your island any time by running down its latitude.\"\n\nOn the last evening, ashore, as usual, to dinner, Grief got his first\nview of the pearls they had collected. Mrs. Hall, waxing enthusiastic,\nhad asked her husband to bring forth the \"pretties,\" and had spent half\nan hour showing them to Grief. His delight in them was genuine, as well\nas was his surprise that they had made so rich a haul.\n\n\"The lagoon is virgin,\" Hall explained. \"You saw yourself that most\nof the shell is large and old. But it's funny that we got most of the\nvaluable pearls in one small patch in the course of a week. It was a\nlittle treasure house. Every oyster seemed filled--seed pearls by the\nquart, of course, but the perfect ones, most of that bunch there, came\nout of the small patch.\"\n\nGrief ran his eye over them and knew their value ranged from one hundred\nto a thousand dollars each, while the several selected large ones went\nfar beyond.\n\n\"Oh, the pretties! the pretties!\" Mrs. Hall cried, bending forward\nsuddenly and kissing them.\n\nA few minutes later she arose to say good-night.\n\n\"It's good-bye,\" Grief said, as he took her hand. \"We sail at daylight.\"\n\n\"So suddenly!\" she cried, while Grief could not help seeing the quick\nlight of satisfaction in her husband's eyes.\n\n\"Yes,\" Grief continued. \"All the repairs are finished. I can't get the\nlongitude of your island out of your husband, though I'm still in hopes\nhe'll relent.\"\n\nHall laughed and shook his head, and, as his wife left the room,\nproposed a last farewell nightcap. They sat over it, smoking and\ntalking.\n\n\"What do you estimate they're worth?\" Grief asked, indicating the spread\nof pearls on the table. \"I mean what the pearl-buyers would give you in\nopen market?\"\n\n\"Oh, seventy-five or eighty thousand,\" Hall said carelessly.\n\n\"I'm afraid you're underestimating. I know pearls a bit. Take that\nbiggest one. It's perfect. Not a cent less than five thousand dollars.\nSome multimillionaire will pay double that some day, when the dealers\nhave taken their whack. And never minding the seed pearls, you've got\nquarts of baroques there. And baroques are coming into fashion. They're\npicking up and doubling on themselves every year.\"\n\nHall gave the trove of pearls a closer and longer scrutiny, estimating\nthe different parcels and adding the sum aloud.\n\n\"You're right,\" he admitted. \"They're worth a hundred thousand right\nnow.\"\n\n\"And at what do you figure your working expenses?\" Grief went on. \"Your\ntime, and your two men's, and the divers'?\"\n\n\"Five thousand would cover it.\"\n\n\"Then they stand to net you ninety-five thousand?\"\n\n\"Something like that. But why so curious?\"\n\n\"Why, I was just trying----\" Grief paused and drained his glass. \"Just\ntrying to reach some sort of an equitable arrangement. Suppose I should\ngive you and your people a passage to Sydney and the five thousand\ndollars--or, better, seven thousand five hundred. You've worked hard.\"\n\nWithout commotion or muscular movement the other man became alert and\ntense. His round-faced geniality went out like the flame of a snuffed\ncandle. No laughter clouded the surface of the eyes, and in their\ndepths showed the hard, dangerous soul of the man. He spoke in a low,\ndeliberate voice.\n\n\"Now just what in hell do you mean by that?\"\n\nGrief casually relighted his cigar.\n\n\"I don't know just how to begin,\" he said. \"The situation is--er--is\nembarrassing for you. You see, I'm trying to be fair. As I say, you've\nworked hard. I don't want to confiscate the pearls. I want to pay you\nfor your time and trouble, and expense.\"\n\nConviction, instantaneous and absolute, froze on the other's face.\n\n\"And I thought you were in Europe,\" he muttered. Hope flickered for\na moment. \"Look here, you're joking me. How do I know you're Swithin\nHall?\"\n\nGrief shrugged his shoulders. \"Such a joke would be in poor taste, after\nyour hospitality. And it is equally in poor taste to have two Swithin\nHalls on the island.\"\n\n\"Since you're Swithin Hall, then who the deuce am I? Do you know that,\ntoo?\"\n\n\"No,\" Grief answered airily. \"But I'd like to know.\"\n\n\"Well, it's none of your business.\"\n\n\"I grant it. Your identity is beside the point. Besides, I know your\nschooner, and I can find out who you are from that.\"\n\n\"What's her name?\"\n\n\"The _Emily L._\n\n\"Correct. I'm Captain Raffy, owner and master.\"\n\n\"The seal-poacher? I've heard of you. What under the sun brought you\ndown here on my preserves?\"\n\n\"Needed the money. The seal herds are about finished.\"\n\n\"And the out-of-the-way places of the world are better policed, eh?\"\n\n\"Pretty close to it. And now about this present scrape, Mr. Hall. I can\nput up a nasty fight. What are you going to do about it?\"\n\n\"What I said. Even better. What's the _Emily L._ worth?\"\n\n\"She's seen her day. Not above ten thousand, which would be robbery.\nEvery time she's in a rough sea I'm afraid she'll jump her ballast\nthrough her planking.\"\n\n\"She has jumped it, Captain Raffy. I sighted her bottom-up after the\nblow. Suppose we say she was worth seven thousand five hundred. I'll\npay over to you fifteen thousand and give you a passage. Don't move your\nhands from your lap.\" Grief stood up, went over to him, and took his\nrevolver. \"Just a necessary precaution, Captain. Now you'll go on board\nwith me. I'll break the news to Mrs. Raffy afterward, and fetch her out\nto join you.\"\n\n\"You're behaving handsomely, Mr. Hall, I must say,\" Captain Raffy\nvolunteered, as the whaleboat came alongside the _Uncle Toby_. \"But\nwatch out for Gorman and Watson. They're ugly customers. And, by the\nway, I don't like to mention it, but you've seen my wife. I've given her\nfour or five pearls. Watson and Gorman were willing.\"\n\n\"Say no more, Captain. Say no more. They shall remain hers. Is that you,\nMr. Snow? Here's a friend I want you to take charge of--Captain Raffy.\nI'm going ashore for his wife.\"\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\nDavid Grief sat writing at the library table in the bungalow\nliving-room. Outside, the first pale of dawn was showing. He had had a\nbusy night. Mrs. Raffy had taken two hysterical hours to pack her and\nCaptain Raffy's possessions. Gorman had been caught asleep, but Watson,\nstanding guard over the divers, had shown fight. Matters did not reach\nthe shooting stage, but it was only after it had been demonstrated to\nhim that the game was up that he consented to join his companions on\nboard. For temporary convenience, he and Gorman were shackled in the\nmate's room, Mrs. Raffy was confined in Grief's, and Captain Raffy made\nfast to the cabin table.\n\nGrief finished the document and read over what he had written:\n\n  To   Swithin   Hall,\n  for   pearls   taken from his lagoon (estimated)             $100,000\n\n  To Herbert Snow, paid in full for salvage from\n  steamship Cascade in pearls (estimated)             $60,000\n\n  To Captain Raffy, salary and expenses for\n  collecting pearls                                     7,500\n\n  To  Captain  Raffy,  reimbursement for\n  schooner  Emily  L.,  lost  in hurricane              7,500\n\n  To Mrs. Raffy, for good will, five fair\n  pearls (estimated)                                    1,100\n\n  To passage to Syndey, four persons,\n  at $120.                                                480\n\n  To  white  lead for painting  Swithin\n  Hall's two whaleboats                                     9\n\n  To  Swithin Hall,  balance  in pearls (estimated)\n  which are to be found in drawer of library table     23,411\n\n                                                     $100,000--$100,000\n\nGrief signed and dated, paused, and added at the bottom:\n\n     _P. S.--Still owing to Swithin Hall three books, borrowed\n     from library: Hudson's \"Law of Psychic Phenomena,\" Zola's\n     \"Paris,\" and Mahan's \"Problem of Asia.\" These books, or full\n     value, can be collected of said David Griefs Sydney office_.\n\nHe shut off the electric light, picked up the bundle of books, carefully\nlatched the front door, and went down to the waiting whaleboat.\n\n\n\n\nChapter Six--A GOBOTO NIGHT\n\n\n\n\nI\n\nAt Goboto the traders come off their schooners and the planters drift\nin from far, wild coasts, and one and all they assume shoes, white duck\ntrousers, and various other appearances of civilization. At Goboto mail\nis received, bills are paid, and newspapers, rarely more than five weeks\nold, are accessible; for the little island, belted with its coral reefs,\naffords safe anchorage, is the steamer port of call, and serves as the\ndistributing point for the whole wide-scattered group.\n\nLife at Goboto is heated, unhealthy, and lurid, and for its size it\nasserts the distinction of more cases of acute alcoholism than any other\nspot in the world. Guvutu, over in the Solomons, claims that it drinks\nbetween drinks. Goboto does not deny this. It merely states, in passing,\nthat in the Goboton chronology no such interval of time is known. It\nalso points out its import statistics, which show a far larger per\ncapita consumption of spiritous liquors. Guvutu explains this on the\nbasis that Goboto does a larger business and has more visitors. Goboto\nretorts that its resident population is smaller and that its visitors\nare thirstier. And the discussion goes on interminably, principally\nbecause of the fact that the disputants do not live long enough to\nsettle it.\n\nGoboto is not large. The island is only a quarter of a mile in diameter,\nand on it are situated an admiralty coal-shed (where a few tons of coal\nhave lain untouched for twenty years), the barracks for a handful of\nblack labourers, a big store and warehouse with sheet-iron roofs, and a\nbungalow inhabited by the manager and his two clerks. They are the white\npopulation. An average of one man out of the three is always to be found\ndown with fever. The job at Goboto is a hard one. It is the policy of\nthe company to treat its patrons well, as invading companies have found\nout, and it is the task of the manager and clerks to do the treating.\nThroughout the year traders and recruiters arrive from far, dry cruises,\nand planters from equally distant and dry shores, bringing with them\nmagnificent thirsts. Goboto is the mecca of sprees, and when they have\nspread they go back to their schooners and plantations to recuperate.\n\nSome of the less hardy require as much as six months between visits. But\nfor the manager and his assistants there are no such intervals. They are\non the spot, and week by week, blown in by monsoon or southeast\ntrade, the schooners come to anchor, cargo'd with copra, ivory nuts,\npearl-shell, hawksbill turtle, and thirst.\n\nIt is a very hard job at Goboto. That is why the pay is twice that on\nother stations, and that is why the company selects only courageous and\nintrepid men for this particular station. They last no more than a year\nor so, when the wreckage of them is shipped back to Australia, or the\nremains of them are buried in the sand across on the windward side of\nthe islet. Johnny Bassett, almost the legendary hero of Goboto, broke\nall records. He was a remittance man with a remarkable constitution,\nand he lasted seven years. His dying request was duly observed by his\nclerks, who pickled him in a cask of trade-rum (paid for out of\ntheir own salaries) and shipped him back to his people in England.\nNevertheless, at Goboto, they tried to be gentlemen. For that matter,\nthough something was wrong with them, they were gentlemen, and had been\ngentlemen. That was why the great unwritten rule of Goboto was that\nvisitors should put on pants and shoes. Breech-clouts, lava-lavas, and\nbare legs were not tolerated. When Captain Jensen, the wildest of the\nBlackbirders though descended from old New York Knickerbocker stock,\nsurged in, clad in loin-cloth, undershirt, two belted revolvers and\na sheath-knife, he was stopped at the beach. This was in the days of\nJohnny Bassett, ever a stickler in matters of etiquette. Captain Jensen\nstood up in the sternsheets of his whaleboat and denied the existence of\npants on his schooner. Also, he affirmed his intention of coming ashore.\nThey of Goboto nursed him back to health from a bullet-hole through his\nshoulder, and in addition handsomely begged his pardon, for no pants\nhad they found on his schooner. And finally, on the first day he sat up,\nJohnny Bassett kindly but firmly assisted his guest into a pair of pants\nof his own. This was the great precedent. In all the succeeding years it\nhad never been violated. White men and pants were undivorce-able. Only\nniggers ran naked. Pants constituted caste.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nOn this night things were, with one exception, in nowise different from\nany other night. Seven of them, with glimmering eyes and steady legs,\nhad capped a day of Scotch with swivel-sticked cocktails and sat down to\ndinner. Jacketed, trousered, and shod, they were: Jerry McMurtrey, the\nmanager; Eddy Little and Jack Andrews, clerks; Captain Stapler, of the\nrecruiting ketch _Merry_; Darby Shryleton, planter from Tito-Ito; Peter\nGee, a half-caste Chinese pearl-buyer who ranged from Ceylon to the\nPaumotus, and Alfred Deacon, a visitor who had stopped off from the last\nsteamer. At first wine was served by the black servants to those that\ndrank it, though all quickly shifted back to Scotch and soda, pickling\ntheir food as they ate it, ere it went into their calcined, pickled\nstomachs.\n\nOver their coffee, they heard the rumble of an anchor-chain through a\nhawse-pipe, tokening the arrival of a vessel.\n\n\"It's David Grief,\" Peter Gee remarked.\n\n\"How do you know?\" Deacon demanded truculently, and then went on to deny\nthe half-caste's knowledge. \"You chaps put on a lot of side over a new\nchum. I've done some sailing myself, and this naming a craft when\nits sail is only a blur, or naming a man by the sound of his\nanchor--it's--it's unadulterated poppycock.\"\n\nPeter Gee was engaged in lighting a cigarette, and did not answer.\n\n\"Some of the niggers do amazing things that way,\" McMurtrey interposed\ntactfully.\n\nAs with the others, this conduct of their visitor jarred on the manager.\nFrom the moment of Peter Gee's arrival that afternoon Deacon had\nmanifested a tendency to pick on him. He had disputed his statements and\nbeen generally rude.\n\n\"Maybe it's because Peter's got Chink blood in him,\" had been Andrews'\nhypothesis. \"Deacon's Australian, you know, and they're daffy down there\non colour.\"\n\n\"I fancy that's it,\" McMurtrey had agreed. \"But we can't permit any\nbullying, especially of a man like Peter Gee, who's whiter than most\nwhite men.\"\n\nIn this the manager had been in nowise wrong. Peter Gee was that rare\ncreature, a good as well as clever Eurasian. In fact, it was the\nstolid integrity of the Chinese blood that toned the recklessness and\nlicentiousness of the English blood which had run in his father's veins.\nAlso, he was better educated than any man there, spoke better English\nas well as several other tongues, and knew and lived more of their own\nideals of gentlemanness than they did themselves. And, finally, he was\na gentle soul. Violence he deprecated, though he had killed men in his\ntime. Turbulence he abhorred.\n\nHe always avoided it as he would the plague.\n\nCaptain Stapler stepped in to help McMurtrey:\n\n\"I remember, when I changed schooners and came into Altman, the niggers\nknew right off the bat it was me. I wasn't expected, either, much less\nto be in another craft. They told the trader it was me. He used the\nglasses, and wouldn't believe them. But they did know. Told me afterward\nthey could see it sticking out all over the schooner that I was running\nher.\"\n\nDeacon ignored him, and returned to the attack on the pearl-buyer.\n\n\"How do you know from the sound of the anchor that it was this\nwhatever-you-called-him man?\" he challenged.\n\n\"There are so many things that go to make up such a judgment,\" Peter\nGee answered. \"It's very hard to explain. It would require almost a text\nbook.\"\n\n\"I thought so,\" Deacon sneered. \"Explanation that doesn't explain is\neasy.\"\n\n\"Who's for bridge?\" Eddy Little, the second clerk, interrupted, looking\nup expectantly and starting to shuffle. \"You'll play, won't you, Peter?\"\n\n\"If he does, he's a bluffer,\" Deacon cut back. \"I'm getting tired of all\nthis poppycock. Mr. Gee, you will favour me and put yourself in a\nbetter light if you tell how you know who that man was that just dropped\nanchor. After that I'll play you piquet.\"\n\n\"I'd prefer bridge,\" Peter answered. \"As for the other thing,\nit's something like this: By the sound it was a small craft--no\nsquare-rigger. No whistle, no siren, was blown--again a small craft. It\nanchored close in--still again a small craft, for steamers and big ships\nmust drop hook outside the middle shoal. Now the entrance is tortuous.\nThere is no recruiting nor trading captain in the group who dares to run\nthe passage after dark. Certainly no stranger would. There _were_ two\nexceptions. The first was Margonville. But he was executed by the High\nCourt at Fiji. Remains the other exception, David Grief. Night or\nday, in any weather, he runs the passage. This is well known to all. A\npossible factor, in case Grief were somewhere else, would be some young\ndare-devil of a skipper. In this connection, in the first place, I don't\nknow of any, nor does anybody else. In the second place, David Grief is\nin these waters, cruising on the _Gunga_, which is shortly scheduled to\nleave here for Karo-Karo. I spoke to Grief, on the _Gunga_, in Sandfly\nPassage, day before yesterday. He was putting a trader ashore on a new\nstation. He said he was going to call in at Babo, and then come on to\nGoboto. He has had ample time to get here. I have heard an anchor drop.\nWho else than David Grief can it be? Captain Donovan is skipper of the\n_Gunga_, and him I know too well to believe that he'd run in to Goboto\nafter dark unless his owner were in charge. In a few minutes David\nGrief will enter through that door and say, 'In Guvutu they merely drink\nbetween drinks.' I'll wager fifty pounds he's the man that enters and\nthat his words will be, 'In Guvutu they merely drink between drinks. '\"\nDeacon was for the moment crushed. The sullen blood rose darkly in his\nface.\n\n\"Well, he's answered you,\" McMurtrey laughed genially. \"And I'll back\nhis bet myself for a couple of sovereigns.\"\n\n\"Bridge! Who's going to take a hand?\" Eddy Little cried impatiently.\n\"Come on, Peter!\"\n\n\"The rest of you play,\" Deacon said. \"He and I are going to play\npiquet.\"\n\n\"I'd prefer bridge,\" Peter Gee said mildly.\n\n\"Don't you play piquet?\"\n\nThe pearl-buyer nodded.\n\n\"Then come on. Maybe I can show I know more about that than I do about\nanchors.\"\n\n\"Oh, I say----\" McMurtrey began.\n\n\"You can play bridge,\" Deacon shut him off. \"We prefer piquet.\"\n\nReluctantly, Peter Gee was bullied into a game that he knew would be\nunhappy.\n\n\"Only a rubber,\" he said, as he cut for deal.\n\n\"For how much?\" Deacon asked.\n\nPeter Gee shrugged his shoulders. \"As you please.\"\n\n\"Hundred up--five pounds a game?\"\n\nPeter Gee agreed.\n\n\"With the lurch double, of course, ten pounds?\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Peter Gee.\n\nAt another table four of the others sat in at bridge. Captain Stapler,\nwho was no card-player, looked on and replenished the long glasses\nof Scotch that stood at each man's right hand. McMurtrey, with poorly\nconcealed apprehension, followed as well as he could what went on at\nthe piquet table. His fellow Englishmen as well were shocked by the\nbehaviour of the Australian, and all were troubled by fear of some\nuntoward act on his part. That he was working up his animosity against\nthe half-caste, and that the explosion might come any time, was apparent\nto all.\n\n\"I hope Peter loses,\" McMurtrey said in an undertone.\n\n\"Not if he has any luck,\" Andrews answered. \"He's a wizard at piquet. I\nknow by experience.\"\n\nThat Peter Gee was lucky was patent from the continual badgering of\nDeacon, who filled his glass frequently. He had lost the first game,\nand, from his remarks, was losing the second, when the door opened and\nDavid Grief entered.\n\n\"In Guvutu they merely drink between drinks,\" he remarked casually to\nthe assembled company, ere he gripped the manager's hand. \"Hello, Mac!\nSay, my skipper's down in the whaleboat. He's got a silk shirt, a tie,\nand tennis shoes, all complete, but he wants you to send a pair of pants\ndown. Mine are too small, but yours will fit him. Hello, Eddy! How's\nthat _ngari-ngari?_ You up, Jock? The miracle has happened. No one down\nwith fever, and no one remarkably drunk.\" He sighed, \"I suppose the\nnight is young yet. Hello, Peter! Did you catch that big squall an hour\nafter you left us? We had to let go the second anchor.\"\n\nWhile he was being introduced to Deacon, McMurtrey dispatched a\nhouse-boy with the pants, and when Captain Donovan came in it was as a\nwhite man should--at least in Goboto.\n\nDeacon lost the second game, and an outburst heralded the fact. Peter\nGee devoted himself to lighting a cigarette and keeping quiet.\n\n\"What?--are you quitting because you're ahead?\" Deacon demanded.\n\nGrief raised his eyebrows questioningly to McMurtrey, who frowned back\nhis own disgust.\n\n\"It's the rubber,\" Peter Gee answered.\n\n\"It takes three games to make a rubber. It's my deal. Come on!\"\n\nPeter Gee acquiesced, and the third game was on.\n\n\"Young whelp--he needs a lacing,\" McMurtrey muttered to Grief. \"Come on,\nlet us quit, you chaps. I want to keep an eye on him. If he goes too far\nI'll throw him out on the beach, company instructions or no.\"\n\n\"Who is he?\" Grief queried.\n\n\"A left-over from last steamer. Company's orders to treat him nice. He's\nlooking to invest in a plantation. Has a ten-thousand-pound letter of\ncredit with the company. He's got 'all-white Australia' on the brain.\nThinks because his skin is white and because his father was once\nAttorney-General of the Commonwealth that he can be a cur. That's why\nhe's picking on Peter, and you know Peter's the last man in the world\nto make trouble or incur trouble. Damn the company. I didn't engage\nto wet-nurse its infants with bank accounts. Come on, fill your glass,\nGrief. The man's a blighter, a blithering blighter.\"\n\n\"Maybe he's only young,\" Grief suggested.\n\n\"He can't contain his drink--that's clear.\" The manager glared his\ndisgust and wrath. \"If he raises a hand to Peter, so help me, I'll give\nhim a licking myself, the little overgrown cad!\"\n\nThe pearl-buyer pulled the pegs out of the cribbage board on which he\nwas scoring and sat back. He had won the third game. He glanced across\nto Eddy Little, saying:\n\n\"I'm ready for the bridge, now.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't be a quitter,\" Deacon snarled.\n\n\"Oh, really, I'm tired of the game,\" Peter Gee assured him with his\nhabitual quietness.\n\n\"Come on and be game,\" Deacon bullied. \"One more. You can't take my\nmoney that way. I'm out fifteen pounds. Double or quits.\"\n\nMcMurtrey was about to interpose, but Grief restrained him with his\neyes.\n\n\"If it positively is the last, all right,\" said Peter Gee, gathering up\nthe cards. \"It's my deal, I believe. As I understand it, this final is\nfor fifteen pounds. Either you owe me thirty or we quit even?\"\n\n\"That's it, chappie. Either we break even or I pay you thirty.\"\n\n\"Getting blooded, eh?\" Grief remarked, drawing up a chair.\n\nThe other men stood or sat around the table, and Deacon played again\nin bad luck. That he was a good player was clear. The cards were merely\nrunning against him. That he could not take his ill luck with equanimity\nwas equally clear. He was guilty of sharp, ugly curses, and he snapped\nand growled at the imperturbable half-caste. In the end Peter Gee\ncounted out, while Deacon had not even made his fifty points. He\nglowered speechlessly at his opponent.\n\n\"Looks like a lurch,\" said Grief.\n\n\"Which is double,\" said Peter Gee.\n\n\"There's no need your telling me,\" Deacon snarled. \"I've studied\narithmetic. I owe you forty-five pounds. There, take it!\"\n\nThe way in which he flung the nine five-pound notes on the table was\nan insult in itself. Peter Gee was even quieter, and flew no signals of\nresentment.\n\n\"You've got fool's luck, but you can't play cards, I can tell you that\nmuch,\" Deacon went on. \"I could teach you cards.\"\n\nThe half-caste smiled and nodded acquiescence as he folded up the money.\n\n\"There's a little game called casino--I wonder if you ever heard of\nit?--a child's game.\"\n\n\"I've seen it played,\" the half-caste murmured gently.\n\n\"What's that?\" snapped Deacon. \"Maybe you think you can play it?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, not for a moment. I'm afraid I haven't head enough for it.\"\n\n\"It's a bully game, casino,\" Grief broke in pleasantly. \"I like it very\nmuch.\"\n\nDeacon ignored him.\n\n\"I'll play you ten quid a game--thirty-one points out,\" was the\nchallenge to Peter Gee. \"And I'll show you how little you know about\ncards. Come on! Where's a full deck?\"\n\n\"No, thanks,\" the half-caste answered. \"They are waiting for me in order\nto make up a bridge set.\"\n\n\"Yes, come on,\" Eddy Little begged eagerly. \"Come on, Peter, let's get\nstarted.\"\n\n\"Afraid of a little game like casino,\" Deacon girded. \"Maybe the stakes\nare too high. I'll play you for pennies--or farthings, if you say so.\"\n\nThe man's conduct was a hurt and an affront to all of them. McMurtrey\ncould stand it no longer.\n\n\"Now hold on, Deacon. He says he doesn't want to play. Let him alone.\"\n\nDeacon turned raging upon his host; but before he could blurt out his\nabuse, Grief had stepped into the breach.\n\n\"I'd like to play casino with you,\" he said.\n\n\"What do you know about it?\"\n\n\"Not much, but I'm willing to learn.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm not teaching for pennies to-night.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's all right,\" Grief answered. \"I'll play for almost any\nsum--within reason, of course.\"\n\nDeacon proceeded to dispose of this intruder with one stroke.\n\n\"I'll play you a hundred pounds a game, if that will do you any good.\"\n\nGrief beamed his delight. \"That will be all right, very right. Let us\nbegin. Do you count sweeps?\"\n\nDeacon was taken aback. He had not expected a Goboton trader to be\nanything but crushed by such a proposition.\n\n\"Do you count sweeps?\" Grief repeated.\n\nAndrews had brought him a new deck, and he was throwing out the joker.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" Deacon answered. \"That's a sissy game.\"\n\n\"I'm glad,\" Grief coincided. \"I don't like sissy games either.\"\n\n\"You don't, eh? Well, then, I'll tell you what we'll do. We'll play for\nfive hundred pounds a game.\"\n\nAgain Deacon was taken aback.\n\n\"I'm agreeable,\" Grief said, beginning to shuffle. \"Cards and spades go\nout first, of course, and then big and little casino, and the aces in\nthe bridge order of value. Is that right?\"\n\n\"You're a lot of jokers down here,\" Deacon laughed, but his laughter was\nstrained. \"How do I know you've got the money?\"\n\n\"By the same token I know you've got it. Mac, how's my credit with the\ncompany?\"\n\n\"For all you want,\" the manager answered.\n\n\"You personally guarantee that?\" Deacon demanded.\n\n\"I certainly do,\" McMurtrey said. \"Depend upon it, the company will\nhonour his paper up and past your letter of credit.\"\n\n\"Low deals,\" Grief said, placing the deck before Deacon on the table.\n\nThe latter hesitated in the midst of the cut and looked around with\nquerulous misgiving at the faces of the others. The clerks and captains\nnodded.\n\n\"You're all strangers to me,\" Deacon complained. \"How am I to know?\nMoney on paper isn't always the real thing.\"\n\nThen it was that Peter Gee, drawing a wallet from his pocket and\nborrowing a fountain pen from McMurtrey, went into action.\n\n\"I haven't gone to buying yet,\" the half-caste explained, \"so the\naccount is intact. I'll just indorse it over to you, Grief. It's for\nfifteen thousand. There, look at it.\"\n\nDeacon intercepted the letter of credit as it was being passed across\nthe table. He read it slowly, then glanced up at McMurtrey.\n\n\"Is that right?\"\n\n\"Yes. It's just the same as your own, and just as good. The company's\npaper is always good.\"\n\nDeacon cut the cards, won the deal, and gave them a thorough shuffle.\nBut his luck was still against him, and he lost the game.\n\n\"Another game,\" he said. \"We didn't say how many, and you can't quit\nwith me a loser. I want action.\"\n\nGrief shuffled and passed the cards for the cut.\n\n\"Let's play for a thousand,\" Deacon said, when he had lost the second\ngame. And when the thousand had gone the way of the two five hundred\nbets he proposed to play for two thousand.\n\n\"That's progression,\" McMurtrey warned, and was rewarded by a glare\nfrom Deacon. But the manager was insistent. \"You don't have to play\nprogression, Grief, unless you're foolish.\"\n\n\"Who's playing this game?\" Deacon flamed at his host; and then, to\nGrief: \"I've lost two thousand to you. Will you play for two thousand?\"\n\nGrief nodded, the fourth game began, and Deacon won. The manifest\nunfairness of such betting was known to all of them. Though he had lost\nthree games out of four, Deacon had lost no money. By the child's device\nof doubling his wager with each loss, he was bound, with the first game\nhe won, no matter how long delayed, to be even again.\n\nHe now evinced an unspoken desire to stop, but Grief passed the deck to\nbe cut.\n\n\"What?\" Deacon cried. \"You want more?\"\n\n\"Haven't got anything yet,\" Grief murmured whimsically, as he began the\ndeal. \"For the usual five hundred, I suppose?\"\n\nThe shame of what he had done must have tingled in Deacon, for he\nanswered, \"No, we'll play for a thousand. And say! Thirty-one points is\ntoo long. Why not twenty-one points out--if it isn't too rapid for you?\"\n\n\"That will make it a nice, quick, little game,\" Grief agreed.\n\nThe former method of play was repeated. Deacon lost two games, doubled\nthe stake, and was again even. But Grief was patient, though the thing\noccurred several times in the next hour's play. Then happened what he\nwas waiting for--a lengthening in the series of losing games for Deacon.\nThe latter doubled to four thousand and lost, doubled to eight thousand\nand lost, and then proposed to double to sixteen thousand.\n\nGrief shook his head. \"You can't do that, you know. You're only ten\nthousand credit with the company.\"\n\n\"You mean you won't give me action?\" Deacon asked hoarsely. \"You mean\nthat with eight thousand of my money you're going to quit?\"\n\nGrief smiled and shook his head.\n\n\"It's robbery, plain robbery,\" Deacon went on. \"You take my money and\nwon't give me action.\"\n\n\"No, you're wrong. I'm perfectly willing to give you what action you've\ngot coming to you. You've got two thousand pounds of action yet.\"\n\n\"Well, we'll play it,\" Deacon took him up. \"You cut.\"\n\nThe game was played in silence, save for irritable remarks and curses\nfrom Deacon. Silently the onlookers filled and sipped their long\nScotch glasses. Grief took no notice of his opponent's outbursts, but\nconcentrated on the game. He was really playing cards, and there were\nfifty-two in the deck to be kept track of, and of which he did keep\ntrack. Two thirds of the way through the last deal he threw down his\nhand.\n\n\"Cards put me out,\" he said. \"I have twenty-seven.\"\n\n\"If you've made a mistake,\" Deacon threatened, his face white and drawn.\n\n\"Then I shall have lost. Count them.\"\n\nGrief passed over his stack of takings, and Deacon, with trembling\nfingers, verified the count. He half shoved his chair back from the\ntable and emptied his glass. He looked about him at unsympathetic faces.\n\n\"I fancy I'll be catching the next steamer for Sydney,\" he said, and for\nthe first time his speech was quiet and without bluster.\n\nAs Grief told them afterward: \"Had he whined or raised a roar I wouldn't\nhave given him that last chance. As it was, he took his medicine like a\nman, and I had to do it.\"\n\nDeacon glanced at his watch, simulated a weary yawn, and started to\nrise.\n\n\"Wait,\" Grief said. \"Do you want further action?\"\n\nThe other sank down in his chair, strove to speak, but could not, licked\nhis dry lips, and nodded his head.\n\n\"Captain Donovan here sails at daylight in the _Gunga_ for Karo-Karo,\"\nGrief began with seeming irrelevance. \"Karo-Karo is a ring of sand in\nthe sea, with a few thousand cocoa-nut trees. Pandanus grows there, but\nthey can't grow sweet potatoes nor taro. There aremabout eight hundred\nnatives, a king and two prime ministers, and the last three named are\nthe only ones who wear any clothes. It's a sort of God-forsaken little\nhole, and once a year I send a schooner up from Goboto. The drinking\nwater is brackish, but old Tom Butler has survived on it for a dozen\nyears. He's the only white man there, and he has a boat's crew of five\nSanta Cruz boys who would run away or kill him if they could. That is\nwhy they were sent there. They can't run away. He is always supplied\nwith the hard cases from the plantations. There are no missionaries.\nTwo native Samoan teachers were clubbed to death on the beach when they\nlanded several years ago.\n\n\"Naturally, you are wondering what it is all about. But have patience.\nAs I have said, Captain Donovan sails on the annual trip to Karo-Karo at\ndaylight to-morrow. Tom Butler is old, and getting quite helpless. I've\ntried to retire him to Australia, but he says he wants to remain and\ndie on Karo-Karo, and he will in the next year or so. He's a queer old\ncodger. Now the time is due for me to send some white man up to take the\nwork off his hands. I wonder how you'd like the job. You'd have to stay\ntwo years.\n\n\"Hold on! I've not finished. You've talked frequently of action this\nevening. There's no action in betting away what you've never sweated\nfor. The money you've lost to me was left you by your father or some\nother relative who did the sweating. But two years of work as trader on\nKaro-Karo would mean something. I'll bet the ten thousand I've won from\nyou against two years of your time. If you win, the money's yours. If\nyou lose, you take the job at Karo-Karo and sail at daylight. Now that's\nwhat might be called real action. Will you play?\"\n\nDeacon could not speak. His throat lumped and he nodded his head as he\nreached for the cards.\n\n\"One thing more,\" Grief said. \"I can do even better. If you lose, two\nyears of your time are mine--naturally without wages. Nevertheless,\nI'll pay you wages. If your work is satisfactory, if you observe all\ninstructions and rules, I'll pay you five thousand pounds a year for two\nyears. The money will be deposited with the company, to be paid to you,\nwith interest, when the time expires. Is that all right?\"\n\n\"Too much so,\" Deacon stammered. \"You are unfair to yourself. A trader\nonly gets ten or fifteen pounds a month.\"\n\n\"Put it down to action, then,\" Grief said, with an air of dismissal.\n\"And before we begin, I'll jot down several of the rules. These you will\nrepeat aloud every morning during the two years--if you lose. They\nare for the good of your soul. When you have repeated them aloud seven\nhundred and thirty Karo-Karo mornings I am confident they will be in\nyour memory to stay. Lend me your pen, Mac. Now, let's see----\"\n\nHe wrote steadily and rapidly for some minutes, then proceeded to read\nthe matter aloud:\n\n\"_I must always remember that one man is as good as another, save and\nexcept when he thinks he is better._\n\n\"_No matter how drunk I am I must not fail to be a gentleman. A\ngentleman is a man who is gentle. Note: It would be better not to get\ndrunk_.\n\n\"_When I play a man's game with men, I must play like a man_.\n\n\"_A good curse, rightly used and rarely, is an efficient thing. Too many\ncurses spoil the cursing. Note: A curse cannot change a card seguence\nnor cause the wind to blow._\n\n\"_There is no license for a man to be less than a man. Ten thousand\npounds cannot purchase such a license._\"\n\nAt the beginning of the reading Deacon's face had gone white with anger.\nThen had arisen, from neck to forehead, a slow and terrible flush that\ndeepened to the end of the reading.\n\n\"There, that will be all,\" Grief said, as he folded the paper and tossed\nit to the centre of the table. \"Are you still ready to play the game?\"\n\n\"I deserve it,\" Deacon muttered brokenly. \"I've been an ass. Mr. Gee,\nbefore I know whether I win or lose, I want to apologize. Maybe it was\nthe whiskey, I don't know, but I'm an ass, a cad, a bounder--everything\nthat's rotten.\"\n\nHe held out his hand, and the half-caste took it beamingly.\n\n\"I say, Grief,\" he blurted out, \"the boy's all right. Call the whole\nthing off, and let's forget it in a final nightcap.\"\n\nGrief showed signs of debating, but Deacon cried:\n\n\"No; I won't permit it. I'm not a quitter. If it's Karo-Karo, it's\nKaro-Karo. There's nothing more to it.\"\n\n\"Right,\" said Grief, as he began the shuffle. \"If he's the right stuff\nto go to Karo-Karo, Karo-Karo won't do him any harm.\"\n\nThe game was close and hard. Three times they divided the deck between\nthem and \"cards\" was not scored. At the beginning of the fifth and\nlast deal, Deacon needed three points to go out, and Grief needed four.\n\"Cards\" alone would put Deacon out, and he played for \"cards\". He no\nlonger muttered or cursed, and played his best game of the evening.\nIncidentally he gathered in the two black aces and the ace of hearts.\n\n\"I suppose you can name the four cards I hold,\" he challenged, as the\nlast of the deal was exhausted and he picked up his hand.\n\nGrief nodded.\n\n\"Then name them.\"\n\n\"The knave of spades, the deuce of spades, the tray of hearts, and the\nace of diamonds,\" Grief answered.\n\nThose behind Deacon and looking at his hand made no sign. Yet the naming\nhad been correct.\n\n\"I fancy you play casino better than I,\" Deacon acknowledged. \"I can\nname only three of yours, a knave, an ace, and big casino.\"\n\n\"Wrong. There aren't five aces in the deck. You've taken in three and\nyou hold the fourth in your hand now.\"\n\n\"By Jove, you're right,\" Deacon admitted. \"I did scoop in three. Anyway,\nI'll make 'cards' on you. That's all I need.\"\n\n\"I'll let you save little casino----\" Grief paused to calculate. \"Yes,\nand the ace as well, and still I'll make 'cards' and go out with big\ncasino. Play.\"\n\n\"No 'cards' and I win!\" Deacon exulted as the last of the hand was\nplayed. \"I go out on little casino and the four aces. 'Big casino' and\n'spades' only bring you to twenty.\"\n\nGrief shook his head. \"Some mistake, I'm afraid.\"\n\n\"No,\" Deacon declared positively. \"I counted every card I took in.\nThat's the one thing I was correct on. I've twenty-six, and you've\ntwenty-six.\"\n\n\"Count again,\" Grief said.\n\nCarefully and slowly, with trembling fingers, Deacon counted the cards\nhe had taken. There were twenty-five. He reached over to the corner of\nthe table, took up the rules Grief had written, folded them, and put\nthem in his pocket. Then he emptied his glass, and stood up. Captain\nDonovan looked at his watch, yawned, and also arose.\n\n\"Going aboard, Captain?\" Deacon asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" was the answer. \"What time shall I send the whaleboat for you?\"\n\n\"I'll go with you now. We'll pick up my luggage from the _Billy_ as we\ngo by, I was sailing on her for Babo in the morning.\"\n\nDeacon shook hands all around, after receiving a final pledge of good\nluck on Karo-Karo.\n\n\"Does Tom Butler play cards?\" he asked Grief.\n\n\"Solitaire,\" was the answer.\n\n\"Then I'll teach him double solitaire.\" Deacon turned toward the door,\nwhere Captain Donovan waited, and added with a sigh, \"And I fancy he'll\nskin me, too, if he plays like the rest of you island men.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Seven--THE FEATHERS OF THE SUN\n\n\n\n\nI\n\nIt was the island of Fitu-Iva--the last independent Polynesian\nstronghold in the South Seas. Three factors conduced to Fitu-Iva's\nindependence. The first and second were its isolation and the\nwarlikeness of its population. But these would not have saved it in\nthe end had it not been for the fact that Japan, France, Great\nBritain, Germany, and the United States discovered its desirableness\nsimultaneously. It was like gamins scrambling for a penny. They got\nin one another's way. The war vessels of the five Powers cluttered\nFitu-Iva's one small harbour. There were rumours of war and threats of\nwar. Over its morning toast all the world read columns about Fitu-Iva.\nAs a Yankee blue jacket epitomized it at the time, they all got their\nfeet in the trough at once.\n\nSo it was that Fitu-Iva escaped even a joint protectorate, and King\nTulifau, otherwise Tui Tulifau, continued to dispense the high justice\nand the low in the frame-house palace built for him by a Sydney trader\nout of California redwood. Not only was Tui Tulifau every inch a king,\nbut he was every second a king. When he had ruled fifty-eight years and\nfive months, he was only fifty-eight years and three months old. That\nis to say, he had ruled over five million seconds more than he had\nbreathed, having been crowned two months before he was born.\n\nHe was a kingly king, a royal figure of a man, standing six feet and\na half, and, without being excessively fat, weighing three hundred and\ntwenty pounds. But this was not unusual for Polynesian \"chief stock.\"\nSepeli, his queen, was six feet three inches and weighed two hundred\nand sixty, while her brother, Uiliami, who commanded the army in the\nintervals of resignation from the premiership, topped her by an inch and\nnotched her an even half-hundredweight. Tui Tulifau was a merry soul, a\ngreat feaster and drinker. So were all his people merry souls, save in\nanger, when, on occasion, they could be guilty even of throwing dead\npigs at those who made them wroth. Nevertheless, on occasion, they could\nfight like Maoris, as piratical sandalwood traders and Blackbirders in\nthe old days learned to their cost.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nGrief's schooner, the _Cantani_, had passed the Pillar Rocks at the\nentrance two hours before and crept up the harbour to the whispering\nflutters of a breeze that could not make up its mind to blow. It was\na cool, starlight evening, and they lolled about the poop waiting till\ntheir snail's pace would bring them to the anchorage. Willie Smee, the\nsupercargo, emerged from the cabin, conspicuous in his shore clothes.\nThe mate glanced at his shirt, of the finest and whitest silk, and\ngiggled significantly.\n\n\"Dance, to-night, I suppose?\" Grief observed.\n\n\"No,\" said the mate. \"It's Taitua. Willie's stuck on her.\"\n\n\"Catch me,\" the supercargo disclaimed.\n\n\"Then she's stuck on you, and it's all the same,\" the mate went on. \"You\nwon't be ashore half an hour before you'll have a flower behind your\near, a wreath on your head, and your arm around Taitua.\"\n\n\"Simple jealousy,\" Willie Smee sniffed. \"You'd like to have her\nyourself, only you can't.\"\n\n\"I can't find shirts like that, that's why. I'll bet you half a crown\nyou won't sail from Fitu-Iva with that shirt.\"\n\n\"And if Taitua doesn't get it, it's an even break Tui Tulifau does,\"\nGrief warned. \"Better not let him spot that shirt, or it's all day with\nit.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Captain Boig agreed, turning his head from watching the\nhouse lights on the shore. \"Last voyage he fined one of my Kanakas out\nof a fancy belt and sheath-knife.\" He turned to the mate. \"You can let\ngo any time, Mr. Marsh. Don't give too much slack. There's no sign of\nwind, and in the morning we may shift opposite the copra-sheds.\"\n\nA minute later the anchor rumbled down. The whaleboat, already hoisted\nout, lay alongside, and the shore-going party dropped into it. Save for\nthe Kanakas, who were all bent for shore, only Grief and the supercargo\nwere in the boat. At the head of the little coral-stone pier Willie\nSmee, with an apologetic gurgle, separated from his employer and\ndisappeared down an avenue of palms. Grief turned in the opposite\ndirection past the front of the old mission church. Here, among\nthe graves on the beach, lightly clad in _ahu's_ and _lava-lavas_,\nflower-crowned and garlanded, with great phosphorescent hibiscus\nblossoms in their hair, youths and maidens were dancing. Farther on,\nGrief passed the long, grass-built _himine_ house, where a few score\nof the elders sat in long rows chanting the old hymns taught them by\nforgotten missionaries. He passed also the palace of Tui Tulifau, where,\nby the lights and sounds, he knew the customary revelry was going\non. For of the happy South Sea isles, Fitu-Iva was the happiest. They\nfeasted and frolicked at births and deaths, and the dead and the unborn\nwere likewise feasted.\n\nGrief held steadily along the Broom Road, which curved and twisted\nthrough a lush growth of flowers and fern-like algarobas. The warm air\nwas rich with perfume, and overhead, outlined against the stars, were\nfruit-burdened mangoes, stately avocado trees, and slender-tufted palms.\nEvery here and there were grass houses. Voices and laughter rippled\nthrough the darkness. Out on the water flickering lights and soft-voiced\nchoruses marked the fishers returning from the reef.\n\nAt last Grief stepped aside from the road, stumbling over a pig that\ngrunted indignantly. Looking through an open door, he saw a stout and\nelderly native sitting on a heap of mats a dozen deep. From time to\ntime, automatically, he brushed his naked legs with a cocoa-nut-fibre\nfly-flicker. He wore glasses, and was reading methodically in what Grief\nknew to be an English Bible. For this was Ieremia, his trader, so named\nfrom the prophet Jeremiah.\n\nIeremia was lighter-skinned than the Fitu-Ivans, as was natural in a\nfull-blooded Samoan. Educated by the missionaries, as lay teacher he had\nserved their cause well over in the cannibal atolls to the westward. As\na reward, he had been sent to the paradise of Fitu-Iva, where all were\nor had been good converts, to gather in the backsliders. Unfortunately,\nIeremia had become too well educated. A stray volume of Darwin, a\nnagging wife, and a pretty Fitu-Ivan widow had driven him into the ranks\nof the backsliders. It was not a case of apostasy. The effect of Darwin\nhad been one of intellectual fatigue. What was the use of trying to\nunderstand this vastly complicated and enigmatical world, especially\nwhen one was married to a nagging woman? As Ieremia slackened in his\nlabours, the mission board threatened louder and louder to send him back\nto the atolls, while his wife's tongue grew correspondingly sharper. Tui\nTulifau was a sympathetic monarch, whose queen, on occasions when he was\nparticularly drunk, was known to beat him. For political reasons--the\nqueen belonging to as royal stock as himself and her brother commanding\nthe army--Tui Tulifau could not divorce her, but he could and did\ndivorce Ieremia, who promptly took up with commercial life and the lady\nof his choice. As an independent trader he had failed, chiefly because\nof the disastrous patronage of Tui Tulifau. To refuse credit to that\nmerry monarch was to invite confiscation; to grant him credit was\ncertain bankruptcy. After a year's idleness on the beach, leremia had\nbecome David Grief's trader, and for a dozen years his service had\nbeen honourable and efficient, for Grief had proven the first man who\nsuccessfully refused credit to the king or who collected when it had\nbeen accorded.\n\nIeremia looked gravely over the rims of his glasses when his employer\nentered, gravely marked the place in the Bible and set it aside, and\ngravely shook hands.\n\n\"I am glad you came in person,\" he said.\n\n\"How else could I come?\" Grief laughed.\n\nBut Ieremia had no sense of humour, and he ignored the remark.\n\n\"The commercial situation on the island is damn bad,\" he said with great\nsolemnity and an unctuous mouthing of the many-syllabled words. \"My\nledger account is shocking.\"\n\n\"Trade bad?\"\n\n\"On the contrary. It has been excellent. The shelves are empty,\nexceedingly empty. But----\" His eyes glistened proudly. \"But there are\nmany goods remaining in the storehouse; I have kept it carefully\nlocked.\"\n\n\"Been allowing Tui Tulifau too much credit?\"\n\n\"On the contrary. There has been no credit at all. And every old account\nhas been settled up.\"\n\n\"I don't follow you, Ieremia,\" Grief confessed. \"What's the\njoke?--shelves empty, no credit, old accounts all square, storehouse\ncarefully locked--what's the answer?\"\n\nIeremia did not reply immediately. Reaching under the rear corner of the\nmats, he drew forth a large cash-box. Grief noted and wondered that\nit was not locked. The Samoan had always been fastidiously cautious in\nguarding cash. The box seemed filled with paper money. He skinned off\nthe top note and passed it over.\n\n\"There is the answer.\"\n\nGrief glanced at a fairly well executed banknote. \"_The First Royal Bank\nof Fitu-Iva will pay to bearer on demand one pound sterling_,\" he read.\nIn the centre was the smudged likeness of a native face. At the bottom\nwas the signature of Tui Tulifau, and the signature of Fulualea, with\nthe printed information appended, \"_Chancellor of the Exchequer._\"\n\n\"Who the deuce is Fulualea?\" Grief demanded. \"It's Fijian, isn't\nit?--meaning the feathers of the sun?\"\n\n\"Just so. It means the feathers of the sun. Thus does this base\ninterloper caption himself. He has come up from Fiji to turn Fitu-Iva\nupside down--that is, commercially.\"\n\n\"Some one of those smart Levuka boys, I suppose?\"\n\nIeremia shook his head sadly. \"No, this low fellow is a white man and\na scoundrel. He has taken a noble and high-sounding Fijian name and\ndragged it in the dirt to suit his nefarious purposes. He has made Tui\nTulifau drunk. He has made him very drunk. He has kept him very drunk\nall the time. In return, he has been made Chancellor of the Exchequer\nand other things. He has issued this false paper and compelled the\npeople to receive it. He has levied a store tax, a copra tax, and a\ntobacco tax. There are harbour dues and regulations, and other taxes.\nBut the people are not taxed--only the traders. When the copra tax was\nlevied, I lowered the purchasing price accordingly. Then the people\nbegan to grumble, and Feathers of the Sun passed a new law, setting\nthe old price back and forbidding any man to lower it. Me he fined two\npounds and five pigs, it being well known that I possessed five pigs.\nYou will find them entered in the ledger. Hawkins, who is trader for\nthe Fulcrum Company, was fined first pigs, then gin, and, because he\ncontinued to make loud conversation, the army came and burned his store.\nWhen I declined to sell, this Feathers of the Sun fined me once more and\npromised to burn the store if again I offended. So I sold all that was\non the shelves, and there is the box full of worthless paper. I shall\nbe chagrined if you pay me my salary in paper, but it would be just, no\nmore than just. Now, what is to be done?\"\n\nGrief shrugged his shoulders. \"I must first see this Feathers of the Sun\nand size up the situation.\"\n\n\"Then you must see him soon,\" Ieremia advised. \"Else he will have an\naccumulation of many fines against you. Thus does he absorb all the\ncoin of the realm. He has it all now, save what has been buried in the\nground.\"\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nOn his way back along the Broom Road, under the lighted lamps that\nmarked the entrance to the palace grounds, Grief encountered a short,\nrotund gentleman, in unstarched ducks, smooth-shaven and of florid\ncomplexion, who was just emerging. Something about his tentative,\nsaturated gait was familiar. Grief knew it on the instant. On the\nbeaches of a dozen South Sea ports had he seen it before.\n\n\"Of all men, Cornelius Deasy!\" he cried.\n\n\"If it ain't Grief himself, the old devil,\" was the return greeting, as\nthey shook hands.\n\n\"If you'll come on board I've some choice smoky Irish,\" Grief invited.\n\nCornelius threw back his shoulders and stiffened.\n\n\"Nothing doin', Mr. Grief. 'Tis Fulualea I am now. No blarneyin' of\nold times for me. Also, and by the leave of his gracious Majesty King\nTulifau, 'tis Chancellor of the Exchequer I am, an' Chief Justice I am,\nsave in moments of royal sport when the king himself chooses to toy with\nthe wheels of justice.\"\n\nGrief whistled his amazement. \"So you're Feathers of the Sun!\"\n\n\"I prefer the native idiom,\" was the correction. \"Fulualea, an' it\nplease you. Not forgettin' old times, Mr. Grief, it sorrows the heart\nof me to break you the news. You'll have to pay your legitimate import\nduties same as any other trader with mind intent on robbin' the gentle\nPolynesian savage on coral isles implanted. ----Where was I? Ah! I\nremember. You've violated the regulations. With malice intent have you\nentered the port of Fitu-Iva after sunset without sidelights burnin'.\nDon't interrupt. With my own eyes did I see you. For which offence are\nyou fined the sum of five pounds. Have you any gin? 'Tis a serious\noffence. Not lightly are the lives of the mariners of our commodious\nport to be risked for the savin' of a penny'orth of oil. Did I ask: have\nyou any gin? Tis the harbour master that asks.\"\n\n\"You've taken a lot on your shoulders,\" Grief grinned.\n\n\"'Tis the white man's burden. These rapscallion traders have been\nputtin' it all over poor Tui Tulif, the best-hearted old monarch\nthat ever sat a South Sea throne an' mopped grog-root from the imperial\ncalabash. 'Tis I, Cornelius--Fulualea, rather--that am here to see\njustice done. Much as I dislike the doin' of it, as harbour master 'tis\nmy duty to find you guilty of breach of quarantine.\"\n\n\"Quarantine?\"\n\n\"'Tis the rulin' of the port doctor. No intercourse with the shore till\nthe ship is passed. What dire calamity to the confidin' native if\nchicken pox or whoopin' cough was aboard of you! Who is there to protect\nthe gentle, confidin' Polynesian? I, Fulualea, the Feathers of the Sun,\non my high mission.\"\n\n\"Who in hell is the port doctor?\" Grief queried.\n\n\"'Tis me, Fulualea. Your offence is serious. Consider yourself fined\nfive cases of first-quality Holland gin.\"\n\nGrief laughed heartily. \"We'll compromise, Cornelius. Come aboard and\nhave a drink.\"\n\nThe Feathers of the Sun waved the proffer aside grandly. \"'Tis bribery.\nI'll have none of it--me faithful to my salt. And wherefore did you not\npresent your ship's papers? As chief of the custom house you are fined\nfive pounds and two more cases of gin.\"\n\n\"Look here, Cornelius. A joke's a joke, but this one has gone far\nenough. This is not Levuka. I've half a mind to pull your nose for you.\nYou can't buck me.\"\n\nThe Feathers of the Sun retreated unsteadily and in alarm.\n\n\"Lay no violence on me,\" he threatened. \"You're right. This is not\nLevuka. And by the same token, with Tui Tulifau and the royal army\nbehind me, buck you is just the thing I can and will. You'll pay them\nfines promptly, or I'll confiscate your vessel. You're not the first.\nWhat does that Chink pearl-buyer, Peter Gee, do but slip into harbour,\nviolatin' all regulations an' makin' rough house for the matter of a\nfew paltry fines. No; he wouldn't pay 'em, and he's on the beach now\nthinkin' it over.\"\n\n\"You don't mean to say----\"\n\n\"Sure an' I do. In the high exercise of office I seized his schooner. A\nfifth of the loyal army is now in charge on board of her. She'll be sold\nthis day week. Some ten tons of shell in the hold, and I'm wonderin'\nif I can trade it to you for gin. I can promise you a rare bargain. How\nmuch gin did you say you had?\"\n\n\"Still more gin, eh?\"\n\n\"An' why not? 'Tis a royal souse is Tui Tulifau. Sure it keeps my wits\nworkin' overtime to supply him, he's that amazin' liberal with it. The\nwhole gang of hanger-on chiefs is perpetually loaded to the guards. It's\ndisgraceful. Are you goin' to pay them fines, Mr. Grief, or is it to\nharsher measures I'll be forced?\"\n\nGrief turned impatiently on his heel.\n\n\"Cornelius, you're drunk. Think it over and come to your senses. The\nold rollicking South Sea days are gone. You can't play tricks like that\nnow.\"\n\n\"If you think you're goin' on board, Mr. Grief, I'll save you the\ntrouble. I know your kind, I foresaw your stiff-necked stubbornness. An'\nit's forestalled you are. 'Tis on the beach you'll find your crew. The\nvessel's seized.\"\n\nGrief turned back on him in the half-belief still that he was joking.\nFulualea again retreated in alarm. The form of a large man loomed beside\nhim in the darkness.\n\n\"Is it you, Uiliami?\" Fulualea crooned. \"Here is another sea pirate.\nStand by me with the strength of thy arm, O Herculean brother.\"\n\n\"Greeting, Uiliami,\" Grief said. \"Since when has Fitu-Iva come to be\nrun by a Levuka beachcomber? He says my schooner has been seized. Is it\ntrue?\"\n\n\"It is true,\" Uiliami boomed from his deep chest. \"Have you any more\nsilk shirts like Willie Smee's? Tui Tulifau would like such a shirt. He\nhas heard of it.\"\n\n\"'Tis all the same,\" Fulualea interrupted. \"Shirts or schooners, the\nking shall have them.\"\n\n\"Rather high-handed, Cornelius,\" Grief murmured. \"It's rank piracy. You\nseized my vessel without giving me a chance.\"\n\n\"A chance is it? As we stood here, not five minutes gone, didn't you\nrefuse to pay your fines?\"\n\n\"But she was already seized.\"\n\n\"Sure, an' why not? Didn't I know you'd refuse? 'Tis all fair, an' no\ninjustice done--Justice, the bright, particular star at whose shining\naltar Cornelius Deasy--or Fulualea, 'tis the same thing--ever worships.\nGet thee gone, Mr. Trader, or I'll set the palace guards on you.\nUiliami, 'tis a desperate character, this trader man. Call the guards.\"\n\nUiliami blew the whistle suspended on his broad bare chest by a cord\nof cocoanut sennit. Grief reached out an angry hand for Cornelius, who\ntitubated into safety behind Uiliami's massive bulk. A dozen strapping\nPolynesians, not one under six feet, ran down the palace walk and ranged\nbehind their commander.\n\n\"Get thee gone, Mr. Trader,\" Cornelius ordered. \"The interview is\nterminated. We'll try your several cases in the mornin'. Appear promptly\nat the palace at ten o'clock to answer to the followin' charges, to\nwit: breach of the peace; seditious and treasonable utterance; violent\nassault on the chief magistrate with intent to cut, wound, maim, an'\nbruise; breach of quarantine; violation of harbour regulations; and\ngross breakage of custom house rules. In the mornin', fellow, in the\nmornin', justice shall be done while the breadfruit falls. And the Lord\nhave mercy on your soul.\"\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nBefore the hour set for the trial Grief, accompanied by Peter Gee, won\naccess to Tui Tulifau. The king, surrounded by half a dozen chiefs, lay\non mats under the shade of the avocados in the palace compound. Early\nas was the hour, palace maids were industriously serving squarefaces of\ngin. The king was glad to see his old friend Davida, and regretful\nthat he had run foul of the new regulations. Beyond that he steadfastly\navoided discussion of the matter in hand. All protests of the\nexpropriated traders were washed away in proffers of gin. \"Have a\ndrink,\" was his invariable reply, though once he unbosomed himself\nenough to say that Feathers of the Sun was a wonderful man. Never had\npalace affairs been so prosperous. Never had there been so much money\nin the treasury, nor so much gin in circulation. \"Well pleased am I with\nFulualea,\" he concluded. \"Have a drink.\"\n\n\"We've got to get out of this _pronto_,\" Grief whispered to Peter Gee a\nfew minutes later, \"or we'll be a pair of boiled owls. Also, I am to be\ntried for arson, or heresy, or leprosy, or something, in a few minutes,\nand I must control my wits.\"\n\nAs they withdrew from the royal presence, Grief caught a glimpse of\nSepeli, the queen. She was peering out at her royal spouse and his\nfellow tipplers, and the frown on her face gave Grief his cue. Whatever\nwas to be accomplished must be through her.\n\nIn another shady corner of the big compound Cornelius was holding court.\nHe had been at it early, for when Grief arrived the case of Willie Smee\nwas being settled. The entire royal army, save that portion in charge of\nthe seized vessels, was in attendance.\n\n\"Let the defendant stand up,\" said Cornelius, \"and receive the just and\nmerciful sentence of the Court for licentious and disgraceful conduct\nunbecomin' a supercargo. The defendant says he has no money. Very well.\nThe Court regrets it has no calaboose. In lieu thereof, and in view\nof the impoverished condition of the defendant, the Court fines said\ndefendant one white silk shirt of the same kind, make and quality at\npresent worn by defendant.\"\n\nCornelius nodded to several of the soldiers, who led the supercargo away\nbehind an avocado tree. A minute later he emerged, minus the garment in\nquestion, and sat down beside Grief.\n\n\"What have you been up to?\" Grief asked.\n\n\"Blessed if I know. What crimes have you committed?\"\n\n\"Next case,\" said Cornelius in his most extra-legal tones. \"David Grief,\ndefendant, stand up. The Court has considered the evidence in the case,\nor cases, and renders the following judgment, to wit:--Shut up!\" he\nthundered at Grief, who had attempted to interrupt. \"I tell you the\nevidence has been considered, deeply considered. It is no wish of the\nCourt to lay additional hardship on the defendant, and the Court takes\nthis opportunity to warn the defendant that he is liable for contempt.\nFor open and wanton violation of harbour rules and regulations, breach\nof quarantine, and disregard of shipping laws, his schooner, the\n_Cantani_, is hereby declared confiscated to the Government of\nFitu-Iva, to be sold at public auction, ten days from date, with\nall appurtenances, fittings, and cargo thereunto pertaining. For the\npersonal crimes of the defendant, consisting of violent and turbulent\nconduct and notorious disregard of the laws of the realm, he is fined in\nthe sum of one hundred pounds sterling and fifteen cases of gin. I will\nnot ask you if you have anything to say. But will you pay? That is the\nquestion.\"\n\nGrief shook his head.\n\n\"In the meantime,\" Cornelius went on, \"consider yourself a prisoner at\nlarge. There is no calaboose in which to confine you. And finally, it\nhas come to the knowledge of the Court, that at an early hour of this\nmorning, the defendant did wilfully and deliberately send Kanakas in his\nemploy out on the reef to catch fish for breakfast. This is distinctly\nan infringement of the rights of the fisherfolk of Fitu-Iva. Home\nindustries must be protected. This conduct of the defendant is severely\nreprehended by the Court, and on any repetition of the offence the\noffender and offenders, all and sundry, shall be immediately put to hard\nlabour on the improvement of the Broom Road. The court is dismissed.\"\n\nAs they left the compound, Peter Gee nudged Grief to look where Tui\nTulifau reclined on the mats. The supercargo's shirt, stretched and\nbulged, already encased the royal fat.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\"The thing is clear,\" said Peter Gee, at a conference in Ieremia's\nhouse. \"Deasy has about gathered in all the coin. In the meantime he\nkeeps the king going on the gin he's captured, on our vessels. As soon\nas he can maneuver it he'll take the cash and skin out on your craft or\nmine.\"\n\n\"He is a low fellow,\" Ieremia declared, pausing in the polishing of his\nspectacles. \"He is a scoundrel and a blackguard. He should be struck by\na dead pig, by a particularly dead pig.\"\n\n\"The very thing,\" said Grief. \"He shall be struck by a dead pig.\nIeremia, I should not be surprised if you were the man to strike him\nwith the dead pig. Be sure and select a particularly dead one. Tui\nTulifau is down at the boat house broaching a case of my Scotch. I'm\ngoing up to the palace to work kitchen politics with the queen. In the\nmeantime you get a few things on your shelves from the store-room. I'll\nlend you some, Hawkins. And you, Peter, see the German store. Start in\nall of you, selling for paper. Remember, I'll back the losses. If\nI'm not mistaken, in three days we'll have a national council or a\nrevolution. You, Ieremia, start messengers around the island to the\nfishers and farmers, everywhere, even to the mountain goat-hunters. Tell\nthem to assemble at the palace three days from now.\"\n\n\"But the soldiers,\" Ieremia objected.\n\n\"I'll take care of them. They haven't been paid for two months. Besides,\nUiliami is the queen's brother. Don't have too much on your shelves at a\ntime. As soon as the soldiers show up with paper, stop selling.\"\n\n\"Then will they burn the stores,\" said Ieremia.\n\n\"Let them. King Tulifau will pay for it if they do.\"\n\n\"Will he pay for my shirt?\" Willie Smee demanded.\n\n\"That is purely a personal and private matter between you and Tui\nTulifau,\" Grief answered.\n\n\"It's beginning to split up the back,\" the supercargo lamented. \"I\nnoticed that much this morning when he hadn't had it on ten minutes. It\ncost me thirty shillings and I only wore it once.\"\n\n\"Where shall I get a dead pig?\" Ieremia asked.\n\n\"Kill one, of course,\" said Grief. \"Kill a small one.\"\n\n\"A small one is worth ten shillings.\"\n\n\"Then enter it in your ledger under operating expenses.\" Grief paused a\nmoment. \"If you want it particularly dead, it would be well to kill it\nat once.\"\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\"You have spoken well, Davida,\" said Queen Sepeli. \"This Fulualea has\nbrought a madness with him, and Tui Tulifau is drowned in gin. If he\ndoes not grant the big council, I shall give him a beating. He is easy\nto beat when he is in drink.\"\n\nShe doubled up her fist, and such were her Amazonian proportions and the\ndetermination in her face that Grief knew the council would be called.\nSo akin was the Fitu-Ivan tongue to the Samoan that he spoke it like a\nnative.\n\n\"And you, Uiliami,\" he said, \"have pointed out that the soldiers have\ndemanded coin and refused the paper Fulualea has offered them. Tell them\nto take the paper and see that they be paid to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Why trouble?\" Uiliami objected. \"The king remains happily drunk. There\nis much money in the treasury. And I am content. In my house are two\ncases of gin and much goods from Hawkins's store.\"\n\n\"Excellent pig, O my brother!\" Sepeli erupted. \"Has not Davida spoken?\nHave you no ears? When the gin and the goods in your house are gone, and\nno more traders come with gin and goods, and Feathers of the Sun has run\naway to Levuka with all the cash money of Fitu-Iva, what then will you\ndo? Cash money is silver and gold, but paper is only paper. I tell you\nthe people are grumbling. There is no fish in the palace. Yams and\nsweet potatoes seem to have fled from the soil, for they come not. The\nmountain dwellers have sent no wild goat in a week. Though Feathers of\nthe Sun compels the traders to buy copra at the old price, the people\nsell not, for they will have none of the paper money. Only to-day have I\nsent messengers to twenty houses. There are no eggs. Has Feathers of the\nSun put a blight upon the hens? I do not know. All I know is that there\nare no eggs. Well it is that those who drink much eat little, else would\nthere be a palace famine. Tell your soldiers to receive their pay. Let\nit be in his paper money.\"\n\n\"And remember,\" Grief warned, \"though there be selling in the stores,\nwhen the soldiers come with their paper it will be refused. And in three\ndays will be the council, and Feathers of the Sun will be as dead as a\ndead pig.\"\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\nThe day of the council found the population of the island crowded into\nthe capital. By canoe and whaleboat, on foot and donkey-back, the five\nthousand inhabitants of Fitu-Iva had trooped in. The three intervening\ndays had had their share of excitement. At first there had been much\nselling from the sparse shelves of the traders. But when the soldiers\nappeared, their patronage was declined and they were told to go to\nFulualea for coin. \"Says it not so on the face of the paper,\" the\ntraders demanded, \"that for the asking the coin will be given in\nexchange?\"\n\nOnly the strong authority of Uiliami had prevented the burning of the\ntraders' houses. As it was, one of Grief's copra-sheds went up in smoke\nand was duly charged by Ieremia to the king's account. Ieremia himself\nhad been abused and mocked, and his spectacles broken. The skin was\noff Willie Smee's knuckles. This had been caused by three boisterous\nsoldiers who violently struck their jaws thereon in quick succession.\nCaptain Boig was similarly injured. Peter Gee had come off undamaged,\nbecause it chanced that it was bread-baskets and not jaws that struck\nhim on the fists.\n\nTui Tulifau, with Sepeli at his side and surrounded by his convivial\nchiefs, sat at the head of the council in the big compound. His\nright eye and jaw were swollen as if he too had engaged in assaulting\nsomebody's fist. It was palace gossip that morning that Sepeli had\nadministered a conjugal beating. At any rate, her spouse was sober,\nand his fat bulged spiritlessly through the rips in Willie Smee's silk\nshirt. His thirst was prodigious, and he was continually served with\nyoung drinking nuts. Outside the compound, held back by the army, was\nthe mass of the common people. Only the lesser chiefs, village maids,\nvillage beaux, and talking men with their staffs of office were\npermitted inside. Cornelius Deasy, as befitted a high and favoured\nofficial, sat near to the right hand of the king. On the left of the\nqueen, opposite Cornelius and surrounded by the white traders he was\nto represent, sat Ieremia. Bereft of his spectacles, he peered\nshort-sightedly across at the Chancellor of the Exchequer.\n\nIn turn, the talking man of the windward coast, the talking man of the\nleeward coast, and the talking man of the mountain villages, each backed\nby his group of lesser talking men and chiefs, arose and made oration.\nWhat they said was much the same. They grumbled about the paper money.\nAffairs were not prosperous. No more copra was being smoked. The people\nwere suspicious. To such a pass had things come that all people wanted\nto pay their debts and no one wanted to be paid. Creditors made a\npractice of running away from debtors. The money was cheap. Prices were\ngoing up and commodities were getting scarce. It cost three times the\nordinary price to buy a fowl, and then it was tough and like to die\nof old age if not immediately sold. The outlook was gloomy. There were\nsigns and omens. There was a plague of rats in some districts. The crops\nwere bad. The custard apples were small. The best-bearing avocado on the\nwindward coast had mysteriously shed all its leaves. The taste had\ngone from the mangoes. The plantains were eaten by a worm. The fish had\nforsaken the ocean and vast numbers of tiger-sharks appeared. The wild\ngoats had fled to inaccessible summits. The poi in the poi-pits had\nturned bitter. There were rumblings in the mountains, night-walking\nof spirits; a woman of Punta-Puna had been struck speechless, and a\nfive-legged she-goat had been born in the village of Eiho. And that all\nwas due to the strange money of Fulualea was the firm conviction of the\nelders in the village councils assembled.\n\nUiliami spoke for the army. His men were discontented and mutinous.\nThough by royal decree the traders were bidden accept the money, yet did\nthey refuse it. He would not say, but it looked as if the strange money\nof Fulualea had something to do with it.\n\nIeremia, as talking man of the traders, next spoke. When he arose, it\nwas noticeable that he stood with legs spraddled over a large grass\nbasket. He dwelt upon the cloth of the traders, its variety and beauty\nand durability, which so exceeded the Fitu-Ivan wet-pounded tapa,\nfragile and coarse. No one wore tapa any more. Yet all had worn\ntapa, and nothing but tapa, before the traders came. There was the\nmosquito-netting, sold for a song, that the cleverest Fitu-Ivan\nnet-weaver could not duplicate in a thousand years. He enlarged on the\nincomparable virtues of rifles, axes, and steel fishhooks, down through\nneedles, thread and cotton fish-lines to white flour and kerosene oil.\n\nHe expounded at length, with firstlies and secondlies and all minor\nsubdivisions of argument, on organization, and order, and civilization.\nHe contended that the trader was the bearer of civilization, and that\nthe trader must be protected in his trade else he would not come. Over\nto the westward were islands which would not protect the traders. What\nwas the result? The traders would not come, and the people were like\nwild animals. They wore no clothes, no silk shirts (here he peered and\nblinked significantly at the king), and they ate one another.\n\nThe queer paper of the Feathers of the Sun was not money. The traders\nknew what money was, and they would not receive it. If Fitu-Iva\npersisted in trying to make them receive it they would go away and never\ncome back. And then the Fitu-Ivans, who had forgotten how to make tapa,\nwould run around naked and eat one another.\n\nMuch more he said, talking a solid hour, and always coming back to what\ntheir dire condition would be when the traders came no more. \"And in\nthat day,\" he perorated, \"how will the Fitu-Ivan be known in the great\nworld? _Kai-kanak_* will men call him. '_Kiakanak! Kai-kanak!_\"\n\n     * Man-eater.\n\nTui Tulifau spoke briefly. The case had been presented, he said, for the\npeople, the army, and the traders. It was now time for Feathers of the\nSun to present his side. It could not be denied that he had wrought\nwonders with his financial system. \"Many times has he explained to me\nthe working of his system,\" Tui Tulif au concluded. \"It is very simple.\nAnd now he will explain it to you.\"\n\nIt was a conspiracy of the white traders, Cornelius contended. Ieremia\nwas right so far as concerned the manifold blessings of white flour\nand kerosene oil. Fitu-Iva did not want to become _kai-kanak_. Fitu-Iva\nwanted civilization; it wanted more and more civilization. Now that was\nthe very point, and they must follow him closely. Paper money was an\nearmark of higher civilization. That was why he, the Feathers of the\nSun, had introduced it. And that was why the traders opposed it. They\ndid not want to see Fitu-Iva civilized. Why did they come across the far\nocean stretches with their goods to Fitu-Iva? He, the Feathers of the\nSun, would tell them why, to their faces, in grand council assembled. In\ntheir own countries men were too civilized to let the traders make the\nimmense profits that they made out of the Fitu-Ivans. If the Fitu-Ivans\nbecame properly civilized, the trade of the traders would be gone. In\nthat day every Fitu-Ivan could become a trader if he pleased.\n\nThat was why the white traders fought the system of paper money, that\nhe, the Feathers of the Sun, had brought. Why was he called the Feathers\nof the Sun? Because he was the Light-Bringer from the World Beyond the\nSky. The paper money was the light. The robbing white traders could not\nflourish in the light. Therefore they fought the light.\n\nHe would prove it to the good people of Fitu-Iva, and he would prove\nit out of the mouths of his enemies. It was a well-known fact that all\nhighly civilized countries had paper-money systems. He would ask Ieremia\nif this was not so.\n\nIeremia did not answer.\n\n\"You see,\" Cornelius went on, \"he makes no answer. He cannot deny what\nis true. England, France, Germany, America, all the great _Papalangi_\ncountries, have the paper-money system. It works. From century to\ncentury it works. I challenge you, Ieremia, as an honest man, as one\nwho was once a zealous worker in the Lord's vineyard, I challenge you to\ndeny that in the great _Papalangi_ countries the system works.\"\n\nIeremia could not deny, and his fingers played nervously with the\nfastening of the basket on his knees.\n\n\"You see, it is as I have said,\" Cornelius continued. \"Ieremia agrees\nthat it is so. Therefore, I ask you, all good people of Fitu-Iva, if\na system is good for the _Papalangi_ countries, why is it not good for\nFitu-Iva?\"\n\n\"It is not the same!\" Ieremia cried. \"The paper of the Feathers of the\nSun is different from the paper of the great countries.\"\n\nThat Cornelius had been prepared for this was evident. He held up a\nFitu-Ivan note that was recognized by all.\n\n\"What is that?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Paper, mere paper,\" was Ieremia's reply.\n\n\"And that?\"\n\nThis time Cornelius held up a Bank of England note.\n\n\"It is the paper money of the English,\" he explained to the Council,\nat the same time extending it for Ieremia to examine. \"Is it not true,\nIeremia, that it is paper money of the English?\"\n\nIeremia nodded reluctantly.\n\n\"You have said that the paper money of Fitu-Iva was paper, now how about\nthis of the English? What is it?.... You must answer like a true man...\nAll wait for your answer, Ieremia.\"\n\n\"It is--it is----\" the puzzled Ieremia began, then spluttered\nhelplessly, the fallacy beyond his penetration.\n\n\"Paper, mere paper,\" Cornelius concluded for him, imitating his halting\nutterance.\n\nConviction sat on the faces of all. The king clapped his hands\nadmiringly and murmured, \"It is most clear, very clear.\"\n\n\"You see, he himself acknowledges it.\" Assured triumph was in Deasy's\nvoice and bearing. \"He knows of no difference. There is no difference.\n'Tis the very image of money. 'Tis money itself.\"\n\nIn the meantime Grief was whispering in Ieremia's ear, who nodded and\nbegan to speak.\n\n\"But it is well known to all the _Papalangi_ that the English Government\nwill pay coin money for the paper.\"\n\nDeasy's victory was now absolute. He held aloft a Fitu-Ivan note.\n\n\"Is it not so written on this paper as well?\"\n\nAgain Grief whispered.\n\n\"That Fitu-Iva will pay coin money?\" asked Ieremia\n\n\"It is so written.\"\n\nA third time Grief prompted.\n\n\"On demand?\" asked Ieremia.\n\n\"On demand,\" Cornelius assured him.\n\n\"Then I demand coin money now,\" said Ieremia, drawing a small package of\nnotes from the pouch at his girdle.\n\nCornelius scanned the package with a quick, estimating eye.\n\n\"Very well,\" he agreed. \"I shall give you the coin money now. How much?\"\n\n\"And we will see the system work,\" the king proclaimed, partaking in his\nChancellor's triumph.\n\n\"You have heard!--He will give coin money now!\" Ieremia cried in a loud\nvoice to the assemblage.\n\nAt the same time he plunged both hands in the basket and drew forth many\npackages of Fitu-Ivan notes. It was noticed that a peculiar odour was\nadrift about the council.\n\n\"I have here,\" Ieremia announced, \"one thousand and twenty-eight pounds\ntwelve shillings and sixpence. Here is a sack to put the coin money in.\"\n\nCornelius recoiled. He had not expected such a sum, and everywhere about\nthe council his uneasy eyes showed him chiefs and talking men drawing\nout bundles of notes. The army, its two months' pay in its hands,\npressed forward to the edge of the council, while behind it the\npopulace, with more money, invaded the compound.\n\n\"'Tis a run on the bank you've precipitated,\" he said reproachfully to\nGrief.\n\n\"Here is the sack to put the coin money in,\" Ieremia urged.\n\n\"It must be postponed,\" Cornelius said desperately, \"'Tis not in banking\nhours.\"\n\nIeremia flourished a package of money. \"Nothing of banking hours is\nwritten here. It says on demand, and I now demand.\"\n\n\"Let them come to-morrow, O Tui Tulifau,\" Cornelius appealed to the\nking. \"They shall be paid to-morrow.\"\n\nTui Tulifau hesitated, but his spouse glared at him, her brawny arm\ntensing as the fist doubled into a redoubtable knot, Tui Tulifau tried\nto look away, but failed. He cleared his throat nervously.\n\n\"We will see the system work,\" he decreed. \"The people have come far.\"\n\n\"'Tis good money you're asking me to pay out,\" Deasy muttered in a low\nvoice to the king.\n\nSepeli caught what he said, and grunted so savagely as to startle the\nking, who involuntarily shrank away from her.\n\n\"Forget not the pig,\" Grief whispered to Ieremia, who immediately stood\nup.\n\nWith a sweeping gesture he stilled the babel of voices that was\nbeginning to rise.\n\n\"It was an ancient and honourable custom of Fitu-Iva,\" he said, \"that\nwhen a man was proved a notorious evildoer his joints were broken with\na club and he was staked out at low water to be fed upon alive by the\nsharks. Unfortunately, that day is past. Nevertheless another ancient\nand honourable custom remains with us. You all know what it is. When a\nman is a proven thief and liar he shall be struck with a dead pig.\"\n\nHis right hand went into the basket, and, despite the lack of his\nspectacles, the dead pig that came into view landed accurately on\nDeasy's neck. With such force was it thrown that the Chancellor, in\nhis sitting position, toppled over sidewise. Before he could recover,\nSepeli, with an agility unexpected of a woman who weighed two hundred\nand sixty pounds, had sprung across to him. One hand clutched his shirt\ncollar, the other hand brandished the pig, and amid the vast uproar of a\ndelighted kingdom she royally swatted him.\n\nThere remained nothing for Tui Tulifau but to put a good face on his\nfavourite's disgrace, and his mountainous fat lay back on the mats and\nshook in a gale of Gargantuan laughter.\n\nWhen Sepeli dropped both pig and Chancellor, a talking man from the\nwindward coast picked up the carcass. Cornelius was on his feet and\nrunning, when the pig caught him on the legs and tripped him. The people\nand the army, with shouts and laughter, joined in the sport.\n\nTwist and dodge as he would, everywhere the ex-Chancellor of the\nExchequer was met or overtaken by the flying pig. He scuttled like a\nfrightened rabbit in and out among the avocados and the palms. No hand\nwas laid upon him, and his tormentors made way before him, but ever they\npursued, and ever the pig flew as fast as hands could pick it up.\n\nAs the chase died away down the Broom Road, Grief led the traders to the\nroyal treasury, and the day was well over ere the last Fitu-Ivan bank\nnote had been redeemed with coin.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\nThrough the mellow cool of twilight a man paddled out from a clump of\njungle to the _Cantani_. It was a leaky and abandoned dugout, and he\npaddled slowly, desisting from time to time in order to bale. The\nKanaka sailors giggled gleefully as he came alongside and painfully\ndrew himself over the rail. He was bedraggled and filthy, and seemed\nhalf-dazed.\n\n\"Could I speak a word with you, Mr. Grief?\" he asked sadly and humbly.\n\n\"Sit to leeward and farther away,\" Grief answered. \"A little farther\naway. That's better.\"\n\nCornelius sat down on the rail and held his head in both his hands.\n\n\"'Tis right,\" he said. \"I'm as fragrant as a recent battlefield. My head\naches to burstin'. My neck is fair broken. The teeth are loose in my\njaws. There's nests of hornets buzzin' in my ears. My medulla oblongata\nis dislocated. I've been through earthquake and pestilence, and the\nheavens have rained pigs.\" He paused with a sigh that ended in a groan.\n\"'Tis a vision of terrible death. One that the poets never dreamed. To\nbe eaten by rats, or boiled in oil, or pulled apart by wild horses--that\nwould be unpleasant. But to be beaten to death with a dead pig!\"\nHe shuddered at the awfulness of it. \"Sure it transcends the human\nimagination.\"\n\nCaptain Boig sniffed audibly, moved his canvas chair farther to\nwindward, and sat down again.\n\n\"I hear you're runnin' over to Yap, Mr. Grief,\" Cornelius went on. \"An'\ntwo things I'm wantin' to beg of you: a passage an' the nip of the old\nsmoky I refused the night you landed.\"\n\nGrief clapped his hands for the black steward and ordered soap and\ntowels.\n\n\"Go for'ard, Cornelius, and take a scrub first,\" he said. \"The boy will\nbring you a pair of dungarees and a shirt. And by the way, before you\ngo, how was it we found more coin in the treasury than paper you had\nissued?\"\n\n\"'Twas the stake of my own I'd brought with me for the adventure.\"\n\n\"We've decided to charge the demurrage and other expenses and loss to\nTui Tulifau,\" Grief said. \"So the balance we found will be turned over\nto you. But ten shillings must be deducted.\"\n\n\"For what?\"\n\n\"Do you think dead pigs grow on trees? The sum of ten shillings for that\npig is entered in the accounts.\"\n\nCornelius bowed his assent with a shudder.\n\n\"Sure it's grateful I am it wasn't a fifteen-shilling pig or a\ntwenty-shilling one.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Eight--THE PEARLS OF PARLAY\n\n\n\n\nI\n\nThe Kanaka helmsman put the wheel down, and the _Malahini_ slipped into\nthe eye of the wind and righted to an even keel. Her head-sails emptied,\nthere was a rat-tat of reef-points and quick shifting of boom-tackles,\nand she was heeled over and filled away on the other tack. Though it was\nearly morning and the wind brisk, the five white men who lounged on\nthe poop-deck were scantily clad. David Grief, and his guest, Gregory\nMulhall, an Englishman, were still in pajamas, their naked feet thrust\ninto Chinese slippers. The captain and mate were in thin undershirts and\nunstarched duck pants, while the supercargo still held in his hands\nthe undershirt he was reluctant to put on. The sweat stood out on his\nforehead, and he seemed to thrust his bare chest thirstily into the wind\nthat did not cool.\n\n\"Pretty muggy, for a breeze like this,\" he complained.\n\n\"And what's it doing around in the west? That's what I want to know,\"\nwas Grief's contribution to the general plaint.\n\n\"It won't last, and it ain't been there long,\" said Hermann, the Holland\nmate. \"She is been chop around all night--five minutes here, ten minutes\nthere, one hour somewhere other quarter.\"\n\n\"Something makin ', something makin ',\" Captain Warfield croaked,\nspreading his bushy beard with the fingers of both hands and shoving\nthe thatch of his chin into the breeze in a vain search for coolness.\n\"Weather's been crazy for a fortnight. Haven't had the proper trades in\nthree weeks. Everything's mixed up. Barometer was pumping at sunset last\nnight, and it's pumping now, though the weather sharps say it don't mean\nanything. All the same, I've got a prejudice against seeing it pump.\nGets on my nerves, sort of, you know. She was pumping that way the time\nwe lost the _Lancaster_. I was only an apprentice, but I can remember\nthat well enough. Brand new, four-masted steel ship; first voyage; broke\nthe old man's heart. He'd been forty years in the company. Just faded\nway and died the next year.\"\n\nDespite the wind and the early hour, the heat was suffocating. The wind\nwhispered coolness, but did not deliver coolness. It might have blown\noff the Sahara, save for the extreme humidity with which it was laden.\nThere was no fog nor mist, nor hint of fog or mist, yet the dimness of\ndistance produced the impression. There were no defined clouds, yet\nso thickly were the heavens covered by a messy cloud-pall that the sun\nfailed to shine through.\n\n\"Ready about!\" Captain Warfield ordered with slow sharpness.\n\nThe brown, breech-clouted Kanaka sailors moved languidly but quickly to\nhead-sheets and boom-tackles.\n\n\"Hard a-lee!\"\n\nThe helmsman ran the spokes over with no hint of gentling, and the\n_Malahini_ darted prettily into the wind and about.\n\n\"Jove! she's a witch!\" was Mulhall's appreciation. \"I didn't know you\nSouth Sea traders sailed yachts.\"\n\n\"She was a Gloucester fisherman originally,\" Grief explained, \"and\nthe Gloucester boats are all yachts when it comes to build, rig, and\nsailing.\"\n\n\"But you're heading right in--why don't you make it?\" came the\nEnglishman's criticism.\n\n\"Try it, Captain Warfield,\" Grief suggested. \"Show him what a lagoon\nentrance is on a strong ebb.\"\n\n\"Close-and-by!\" the captain ordered.\n\n\"Close-and-by,\" the Kanaka repeated, easing half a spoke.\n\nThe _Malahini_ laid squarely into the narrow passage which was the\nlagoon entrance _of_ a large, long, and narrow oval of an atoll. The\natoll was shaped as if three atolls, in the course of building, had\ncollided and coalesced and failed to rear the partition walls. Cocoanut\npalms grew in spots on the circle of sand, and there were many gaps\nwhere the sand was too low to the sea for cocoanuts, and through which\ncould be seen the protected lagoon where the water lay flat like the\nruffled surface of a mirror. Many square miles of water were in the\nirregular lagoon, all of which surged out on the ebb through the one\nnarrow channel. So narrow was the channel, so large the outflow of\nwater, that the passage was more like the rapids of a river than the\nmere tidal entrance to an atoll. The water boiled and whirled and\nswirled and drove outward in a white foam of stiff, serrated waves. Each\nheave and blow on her bows of the upstanding waves of the current swung\nthe Malahini off the straight lead and wedged her as with wedges of\nsteel toward the side of the passage. Part way in she was, when her\ncloseness to the coral edge compelled her to go about. On the opposite\ntack, broadside to the current, she swept seaward with the current's\nspeed.\n\n\"Now's the time for that new and expensive engine of yours,\" Grief\njeered good-naturedly.\n\nThat the engine was a sore point with Captain Warfield was patent. He\nhad begged and badgered for it, until in the end Grief had given his\nconsent.\n\n\"It will pay for itself yet,\" the captain retorted, \"You wait and\nsee. It beats insurance and you know the underwriters won't stand for\ninsurance in the Paumotus.\"\n\nGrief pointed to a small cutter beating up astern of them on the same\ncourse.\n\n\"I'll wager a five-franc piece the little Nuhiva beats us in.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Captain Warfield agreed. \"She's overpowered. We're like a liner\nalongside of her, and we've only got forty horsepower. She's got ten\nhorse, and she's a little skimming dish. She could skate across the\nfroth of hell, but just the same she can't buck this current. It's\nrunning ten knots right now.\"\n\nAnd at the rate of ten knots, buffeted and jerkily rolled, the\n_Malahini_ went out to sea with the tide.\n\n\"She'll slacken in half an hour--then we'll make headway,\" Captain\nWarfield said, with an irritation explained by his next words. \"He has\nno right to call it Parlay. It's down on the admiralty charts, and the\nFrench charts, too, as Hikihoho. Bougainville discovered it and named it\nfrom the natives.\"\n\n\"What's the name matter?\" the supercargo demanded, taking advantage of\nspeech to pause with arms shoved into the sleeves of the undershirt.\n\"There it is, right under our nose, and old Parlay is there with the\npearls.\"\n\n\"Who see them pearl?\" Hermann queried, looking from one to another.\n\n\"It's well known,\" was the supercargo's reply. He turned to the\nsteersman: \"Tai-Hotauri, what about old Parlay's pearls?\"\n\nThe Kanaka, pleased and self-conscious, took and gave a spoke.\n\n\"My brother dive for Parlay three, four month, and he make much talk\nabout pearl. Hikihoho very good place for pearl.\"\n\n\"And the pearl-buyers have never got him to part with a pearl,\" the\ncaptain broke in.\n\n\"And they say he had a hatful for Armande when he sailed for Tahiti,\"\nthe supercargo carried on the tale. \"That's fifteen years ago, and he's\nbeen adding to it ever since--stored the shell as well. Everybody's seen\nthat--hundreds of tons of it. They say the lagoon's fished clean now.\nMaybe that's why he's announced the auction.\"\n\n\"If he really sells, this will be the biggest year's output of pearls in\nthe Paumotus,\" Grief said.\n\n\"I say, now, look here!\" Mulhall burst forth, harried by the humid\nheat as much as the rest of them. \"What's it all about? Who's the old\nbeachcomber anyway? What are all these pearls? Why so secretious about\nit?\"\n\n\"Hikihoho belongs to old Parlay,\" the supercargo answered. \"He's got a\nfortune in pearls, saved up for years and years, and he sent the word\nout weeks ago that he'd auction them off to the buyers to-morrow. See\nthose schooners' masts sticking up inside the lagoon?\"\n\n\"Eight, so I see,\" said Hermann.\n\n\"What are they doing in a dinky atoll like this?\" the supercargo went\non. \"There isn't a schooner-load of copra a year in the place. They've\ncome for the auction. That's why we're here. That's why the little\n_Nuhiva's_ bumping along astern there, though what she can buy is beyond\nme. Narii Herring--he's an English Jew half-caste--owns and runs her,\nand his only assets are his nerve, his debts, and his whiskey bills.\nHe's a genius in such things. He owes so much that there isn't a\nmerchant in Papeete who isn't interested in his welfare. They go out of\ntheir way to throw work in his way. They've got to, and a dandy stunt it\nis for Narii. Now I owe nobody. What's the result? If I fell down in\na fit on the beach they'd let me lie there and die. They wouldn't lose\nanything. But Narii Herring?--what wouldn't they do if he fell in a fit?\nTheir best wouldn't be too good for him. They've got too much money\ntied up in him to let him lie. They'd take him into their homes and\nhand-nurse him like a brother. Let me tell you, honesty in paying bills\nain't what it's cracked up to be.\"\n\n\"What's this Narii chap got to do with it?\" was the Englishman's\nshort-tempered demand. And, turning to Grief, he said, \"What's all this\npearl nonsense? Begin at the beginning.\"\n\n\"You'll have to help me out,\" Grief warned the others, as he began. \"Old\nParlay is a character. From what I've seen of him I believe he's partly\nand mildly insane. Anyway, here's the story: Parlay's a full-blooded\nFrenchman. He told me once that he came from Paris. His accent is the\ntrue Parisian. He arrived down here in the old days. Went to trading\nand all the rest. That's how he got in on Hikihoho. Came in trading when\ntrading was the real thing. About a hundred miserable Paumotans lived\non the island. He married the queen--native fashion. When she died,\neverything was his. Measles came through, and there weren't more than a\ndozen survivors. He fed them, and worked them, and was king. Now before\nthe queen died she gave birth to a girl. That's Armande. When she was\nthree he sent her to the convent at Papeete. When she was seven or eight\nhe sent her to France. You begin to glimpse the situation. The best\nand most aristocratic convent in France was none too good for the only\ndaughter of a Paumotan island king and capitalist, and you know the old\ncountry French draw no colour line. She was educated like a princess,\nand she accepted herself in much the same way. Also, she thought she was\nall-white, and never dreamed of a bar sinister.\n\n\"Now comes the tragedy. The old man had always been cranky and erratic,\nand he'd played the despot on Hikihoho so long that he'd got the idea\nin his head that there was nothing wrong with the king--or the princess\neither. When Armande was eighteen he sent for her. He had slews and\nslathers of money, as Yankee Bill would say. He'd built the big house on\nHikihoho, and a whacking fine bungalow in Papeete. She was to arrive on\nthe mail boat from New Zealand, and he sailed in his schooner to meet\nher at Papeete. And he might have carried the situation off, despite the\nhens and bull-beasts of Papeete, if it hadn't been for the hurricane.\nThat was the year, wasn't it, when Manu-Huhi was swept and eleven\nhundred drowned?\"\n\nThe others nodded, and Captain Warfield said: \"I was in the _Magpie_\nthat blow, and we went ashore, all hands and the cook, _Magpie_ and all,\na quarter of a mile into the cocoanuts at the head of Taiohae Bay--and\nit a supposedly hurricane-proof harbour.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Grief continued, \"old Parlay got caught in the same blow, and\narrived in Papeete with his hatful of pearls three weeks too late. He'd\nhad to jack up his schooner and build half a mile of ways before he\ncould get her back into the sea.\n\n\"And in the meantime there was Armande at Papeete. Nobody called on her.\nShe did, French fashion, make the initial calls on the Governor and the\nport doctor. They saw her, but neither of their hen-wives was at home to\nher nor returned the call. She was out of caste, without caste, though\nshe had never dreamed it, and that was the gentle way they broke the\ninformation to her. There was a gay young lieutenant on the French\ncruiser. He lost his heart to her, but not his head. You can imagine\nthe shock to this young woman, refined, beautiful, raised like an\naristocrat, pampered with the best of old France that money could buy.\nAnd you can guess the end.\" He shrugged his shoulders. \"There was a\nJapanese servant in the bungalow. He saw it. Said she did it with the\nproper spirit of the Samurai. Took a stiletto--no thrust, no drive,\nno wild rush for annihilation--took the stiletto, placed the point\ncarefully against her heart, and with both hands, slowly and steadily,\npressed home.\n\n\"Old Parlay arrived after that with his pearls. There was one single one\nof them, they say, worth sixty thousand francs. Peter Gee saw it, and\nhas told me he offered that much for it. The old man went clean off for\na while. They had him strait-jacketed in the Colonial Club two days----\"\n\n\"His wife's uncle, an old Paumotan, cut him out of the jacket and turned\nhim loose,\" the supercargo corroborated.\n\n\"And then old Parlay proceeded to eat things up,\" Grief went on. \"Pumped\nthree bullets into the scalawag of a lieutenant----\"\n\n\"Who lay in sick bay for three months,\" Captain Warfield contributed.\n\n\"Flung a glass of wine in the Governor's face; fought a duel with the\nport doctor; beat up his native servants; wrecked the hospital; broke\ntwo ribs and the collarbone of a man nurse, and escaped; and went down\nto his schooner, a gun in each hand, daring the chief of police and all\nthe gendarmes to arrest him, and sailed for Hikihoho. And they say he's\nnever left the island since.\"\n\nThe supercargo nodded. \"That was fifteen years ago, and he's never\nbudged.\"\n\n\"And added to his pearls,\" said the captain. \"He's a blithering old\nlunatic. Makes my flesh creep. He's a regular Finn.\"\n\n\"What's that?\" Mulhall inquired.\n\n\"Bosses the weather--that's what the natives believe, at any rate. Ask\nTai-Hotauri there. Hey, Tai-Hotauri! what you think old Parlay do along\nweather?\"\n\n\"Just the same one big weather devil,\" came the Kanaka's answer. \"I\nknow. He want big blow, he make big blow. He want no wind, no wind\ncome.\"\n\n\"A regular old Warlock,\" said Mulhall.\n\n\"No good luck them pearl,\" Tai-Hotauri blurted out, rolling his head\nominously. \"He say he sell. Plenty schooner come. Then he make big\nhurricane, everybody finish, you see. All native men say so.\"\n\n\"It's hurricane season now,\" Captain War-field laughed morosely.\n\"They're not far wrong. It's making for something right now, and I'd\nfeel better if the _Malahini_ was a thousand miles away from here.\"\n\n\"He is a bit mad,\" Grief concluded. \"I've tried to get his point of\nview. It's--well, it's mixed. For eighteen years he'd centred everything\non Armande. Half the time he believes she's still alive, not yet come\nback from France. That's one of the reasons he held on to the pearls.\nAnd all the time he hates white men. He never forgets they killed her,\nthough a great deal of the time he forgets she's dead. Hello! Where's\nyour wind?\"\n\nThe sails bellied emptily overhead, and Captain Warfield grunted his\ndisgust. Intolerable as the heat had been, in the absence of wind it\nwas almost overpowering. The sweat oozed out on all their faces, and now\none, and again another, drew deep breaths, involuntarily questing for\nmore air.\n\n\"Here she comes again--an eight point haul! Boom-tackles across! Jump!\"\n\nThe Kanakas sprang to the captain's orders, and for five minutes the\nschooner laid directly into the passage and even gained on the current.\nAgain the breeze fell flat, then puffed from the old quarter, compelling\na shift back of sheets and tackles.\n\n\"Here comes the _Nuhiva_\" Grief said. \"She's got her engine on. Look at\nher skim.\"\n\n\"All ready?\" the captain asked the engineer, a Portuguese half-caste,\nwhose head and shoulders protruded from the small hatch just for'ard of\nthe cabin, and who wiped the sweat from his face with a bunch of greasy\nwaste.\n\n\"Sure,\" he replied.\n\n\"Then let her go.\"\n\nThe engineer disappeared into his den, and a moment later the exhaust\nmuffler coughed and spluttered overside. But the schooner could not hold\nher lead. The little cutter made three feet to her two and was quickly\nalongside and forging ahead. Only natives were on her deck, and the man\nsteering waved his hand in derisive greeting and farewell.\n\n\"That's Narii Herring,\" Grief told Mulhall. \"The big fellow at the\nwheel--the nerviest and most conscienceless scoundrel in the Paumotus.\"\n\nFive minutes later a cry of joy from their own Kanakas centred all eyes\non the _Nuhiva_. Her engine had broken down and they were overtaking\nher. The _Malahini's_ sailors sprang into the rigging and jeered as they\nwent by; the little cutter heeled over by the wind with a bone in her\nteeth, going backward on the tide.\n\n\"Some engine that of ours,\" Grief approved, as the lagoon opened before\nthem and the course was changed across it to the anchorage.\n\nCaptain Warfield was visibly cheered, though he merely grunted, \"It'll\npay for itself, never fear.\"\n\nThe _Malahini_ ran well into the centre of the little fleet ere she\nfound swinging room to anchor.\n\n\"There's Isaacs on the _Dolly_,\" Grief observed, with a hand wave of\ngreeting. \"And Peter Gee's on the _Roberta_. Couldn't keep him away from\na pearl sale like this. And there's Francini on the _Cactus_. They're\nall here, all the buyers. Old Parlay will surely get a price.\"\n\n\"They haven't repaired the engine yet,\" Captain Warfield grumbled\ngleefully.\n\nHe was looking across the lagoon to where the _Nuhiva's_ sails showed\nthrough the sparse cocoa-nuts.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nThe house of Parlay was a big two-story frame affair, built of\nCalifornia lumber, with a galvanized iron roof. So disproportionate\nwas it to the slender ring of the atoll that it showed out upon the\nsand-strip and above it like some monstrous excrescence. They of the\n_Malahini_ paid the courtesy visit ashore immediately after anchoring.\nOther captains and buyers were in the big room examining the pearls that\nwere to be auctioned next day. Paumotan servants, natives of Hikihoho,\nand relatives of the owner, moved about dispensing whiskey and absinthe.\nAnd through the curious company moved Parlay himself, cackling and\nsneering, the withered wreck of what had once been a tall and powerful\nman. His eyes were deep sunken and feverish, his cheeks fallen in and\ncavernous. The hair of his head seemed to have come out in patches, and\nhis mustache and imperial had shed in the same lopsided way.\n\n\"Jove!\" Mulhall muttered under his breath. \"A long-legged Napoleon the\nThird, but burnt out, baked, and fire-crackled. And mangy! No wonder he\ncrooks his head to one side. He's got to keep the balance.\"\n\n\"Goin' to have a blow,\" was the old man's greeting to Grief. \"You must\nthink a lot of pearls to come a day like this.\"\n\n\"They're worth going to inferno for,\" Grief laughed genially back,\nrunning his eyes over the surface of the table covered by the display.\n\n\"Other men have already made that journey for them,\" old Parlay cackled.\n\"See this one!\" He pointed to a large, perfect pearl the size of a small\nwalnut that lay apart on a piece of chamois. \"They offered me sixty\nthousand francs for it in Tahiti. They'll bid as much and more for it\nto-morrow, if they aren't blown away. Well, that pearl, it was found by\nmy cousin, my cousin by marriage. He was a native, you see. Also, he\nwas a thief. He hid it. It was mine. His cousin, who was also my\ncousin--we're all related here--killed him for it and fled away in a\ncutter to Noo-Nau. I pursued, but the chief of Noo-Nau had killed him\nfor it before I got there. Oh, yes, there are many dead men represented\non the table there. Have a drink, Captain. Your face is not familiar.\nYou are new in the islands?\"\n\n\"It's Captain Robinson of the _Roberta_,\" Grief said, introducing them.\n\nIn the meantime Mulhall had shaken hands with Peter Gee.\n\n\"I never fancied there were so many pearls in the world,\" Mulhall said.\n\n\"Nor have I ever seen so many together at one time,\" Peter Gee admitted.\n\n\"What ought they to be worth?\"\n\n\"Fifty or sixty thousand pounds--and that's to us buyers. In\nParis----\" He shrugged his shoulders and lifted his eyebrows at the\nincommunicableness of the sum.\n\nMulhall wiped the sweat from his eyes. All were sweating profusely\nand breathing hard. There was no ice in the drink that was served, and\nwhiskey and absinthe went down lukewarm.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" Parlay was cackling. \"Many dead men lie on the table\nthere. I know those pearls, all of them. You see those three! Perfectly\nmatched, aren't they? A diver from Easter Island got them for me inside\na week. Next week a shark got him; took his arm off and blood poison did\nthe business. And that big baroque there--nothing much--if I'm\noffered twenty francs for it to-morrow I'll be in luck; it came out of\ntwenty-two fathoms of water. The man was from Raratonga. He broke all\ndiving records. He got it out of twenty-two fathoms. I saw him. And he\nburst his lungs at the same time, or got the 'bends,' for he died in two\nhours. He died screaming. They could hear him for miles. He was the most\npowerful native I ever saw. Half a dozen of my divers have died of the\nbends. And more men will die, more men will die.\"\n\n\"Oh, hush your croaking, Parlay,\" chided one of the captains. \"It ain't\ngoing to blow.\"\n\n\"If I was a strong man, I couldn't get up hook and get out fast enough,\"\nthe old man retorted in the falsetto of age. \"Not if I was a strong man\nwith the taste for wine yet in my mouth. But not you. You'll all stay, I\nwouldn't advise you if I thought you'd go, You can't drive buzzards away\nfrom the carrion. Have another drink, my brave sailor-men. Well, well,\nwhat men will dare for a few little oyster drops! There they are, the\nbeauties! Auction to-morrow, at ten sharp. Old Parlay's selling out, and\nthe buzzards are gathering--old Parlay who was a stronger man in his day\nthan any of them and who will see most of them dead yet.\"\n\n\"If he isn't a vile old beast!\" the supercargo of the _Malahini_\nwhispered to Peter Gee.\n\n\"What if she does blow?\" said the captain of the _Dolly_. \"Hikihoho's\nnever been swept.\"\n\n\"The more reason she will be, then,\" Captain Warfield answered back. \"I\nwouldn't trust her.\"\n\n\"Who's croaking now?\" Grief reproved.\n\n\"I'd hate to lose that new engine before it paid for itself,\" Captain\nWarfield replied gloomily.\n\nParlay skipped with astonishing nimbleness across the crowded room to\nthe barometer on the wall.\n\n\"Take a look, my brave sailormen!\" he cried exultantly.\n\nThe man nearest read the glass. The sobering effect showed plainly on\nhis face.\n\n\"It's dropped ten,\" was all he said, yet every face went anxious, and\nthere was a look as if every man desired immediately to start for the\ndoor.\n\n\"Listen!\" Parlay commanded.\n\nIn the silence the outer surf seemed to have become unusually loud.\nThere was a great rumbling roar.\n\n\"A big sea is beginning to set,\" some one said; and there was a movement\nto the windows, where all gathered.\n\nThrough the sparse cocoanuts they gazed seaward. An orderly succession\nof huge smooth seas was rolling down upon the coral shore. For some\nminutes they gazed on the strange sight and talked in low voices, and in\nthose few minutes it was manifest to all that the waves were increasing\nin size. It was uncanny, this rising sea in a dead calm, and their\nvoices unconsciously sank lower. Old Parlay shocked them with his abrupt\ncackle.\n\n\"There is yet time to get away to sea, brave gentlemen. You can tow\nacross the lagoon with your whaleboats.\"\n\n\"It's all right, old man,\" said Darling, the mate of the _Cactus_, a\nstalwart youngster of twenty-five. \"The blow's to the southward and\npassing on. We'll not get a whiff of it.\"\n\nAn air of relief went through the room. Conversations were started, and\nthe voices became louder. Several of the buyers even went back to the\ntable to continue the examination of the pearls.\n\nParlay's shrill cackle rose higher.\n\n\"That's right,\" he encouraged. \"If the world was coming to an end you'd\ngo on buying.\"\n\n\"We'll buy these to-morrow just the same,\" Isaacs assured him.\n\n\"Then you'll be doing your buying in hell.\"\n\nThe chorus of incredulous laughter incensed the old man. He turned\nfiercely on Darling.\n\n\"Since when have children like you come to the knowledge of storms? And\nwho is the man who has plotted the hurricane-courses of the Paumotus?\nWhat books will you find it in? I sailed the Paumotus before the oldest\nof you drew breath. I know. To the eastward the paths of the hurricanes\nare on so wide a circle they make a straight line. To the westward here\nthey make a sharp curve. Remember your chart. How did it happen the\nhurricane of '91 swept Auri and Hiolau? The curve, my brave boy, the\ncurve! In an hour, or two or three at most, will come the wind. Listen\nto that!\"\n\nA vast rumbling crash shook the coral foundations of the atoll. The\nhouse quivered to it. The native servants, with bottles of whiskey and\nabsinthe in their hands, shrank together as if for protection and stared\nwith fear through the windows at the mighty wash of the wave lapping far\nup the beach to the corner of a copra-shed.\n\nParlay looked at the barometer, giggled, and leered around at his\nguests. Captain War-field strode across to see.\n\n\"29:75,\" he read. \"She's gone down five more. By God! the old devil's\nright. She's a-coming, and it's me, for one, for aboard.\"\n\n\"It's growing dark,\" Isaacs half whispered.\n\n\"Jove! it's like a stage,\" Mulhall said to Grief, looking at his watch.\n\"Ten o'clock in the morning, and it's like twilight. Down go the lights\nfor the tragedy. Where's the slow music!\"\n\nIn answer, another rumbling crash shook the atoll and the house. Almost\nin a panic the company started for the door. In the dim light their\nsweaty faces appeared ghastly. Isaacs panted asthmatically in the\nsuffocating heat.\n\n\"What's your haste?\" Parlay chuckled and girded at his departing guests.\n\"A last drink, brave gentlemen.\" No one noticed him. As they took the\nshell-bordered path to the beach he stuck his head out the door and\ncalled, \"Don't forget, gentlemen, at ten to-morrow old Parlay sells his\npearls.\"\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nOn the beach a curious scene took place. Whaleboat after whaleboat was\nbeing hurriedly manned and shoved off. It had grown still darker. The\nstagnant calm continued, and the sand shook under their feet with each\nbuffet of the sea on the outer shore. Narii Herring walked leisurely\nalong the sand. He grinned at the very evident haste of the captains and\nbuyers. With him were three of his Kanakas, and also Tai-Hotauri.\n\n\"Get into the boat and take an oar,\" Captain Warfield ordered the\nlatter.\n\nTai-Hotauri came over jauntily, while Narii Herring and his three\nKanakas paused and looked on from forty feet away.\n\n\"I work no more for you, skipper,\" Tai-Hotauri said insolently and\nloudly. But his face belied his words, for he was guilty of a\nprodigious wink. \"Fire me, skipper,\" he huskily whispered, with a second\nsignificant wink.\n\nCaptain Warfield took the cue and proceeded to do some acting himself.\nHe raised his fist and his voice.\n\n\"Get into that boat,\" he thundered, \"or I'll knock seven bells out of\nyou!\"\n\nThe Kanaka drew back truculently, and Grief stepped between to placate\nhis captain.\n\n\"I go to work on the _Nuhiva_,\" Tai-Hotauri said, rejoining the other\ngroup.\n\n\"Come back here!\" the captain threatened.\n\n\"He's a free man, skipper,\" Narii Herring spoke up. \"He's sailed with me\nin the past, and he's sailing again, that's all.\"\n\n\"Come on, we must get on board,\" Grief urged. \"Look how dark it's\ngetting.\"\n\nCaptain Warfield gave in, but as the boat shoved off he stood up in the\nsternsheets and shook his fist ashore.\n\n\"I'll settle with you yet, Narii,\" he cried. \"You're the only skipper in\nthe group that steals other men's sailors,\" He sat down, and in lowered\nvoice queried: \"Now what's Tai-Hotauri up to? He's on to something, but\nwhat is it?\"\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nAs the boat came alongside the _Malahini_, Hermann's anxious face\ngreeted them over the rail.\n\n\"Bottom out fall from barometer,\" he announced. \"She's goin' to blow. I\ngot starboard anchor overhaul.\"\n\n\"Overhaul the big one, too,\" Captain Warfield ordered, taking charge.\n\"And here, some of you, hoist in this boat. Lower her down to the deck\nand lash her bottom up.\"\n\nMen were busy at work on the decks of all the schooners. There was a\ngreat clanking of chains being overhauled, and now one craft, and\nnow another, hove in, veered, and dropped a second anchor. Like the\n_Malahini_, those that had third anchors were preparing to drop them\nwhen the wind showed what quarter it was to blow from.\n\nThe roar of the big surf continually grew though the lagoon lay in the\nmirror-like calm.\n\nThere was no sign of life where Parlay's big house perched on the sand.\nBoat and copra-sheds and the sheds where the shell was stored were\ndeserted.\n\n\"For two cents I'd up anchors and get out,\" Grief said. \"I'd do it\nanyway if it were open sea. But those chains of atolls to the north and\neast have us pocketed. We've a better chance right here. What do you\nthink, Captain Warfield?\"\n\n\"I agree with you, though a lagoon is no mill-pond for riding it out.\nI wonder where she's going to start from? Hello! There goes one of\nParlay's copra-sheds.\"\n\nThey could see the grass-thatched shed lift and collapse, while a froth\nof foam cleared the crest of the sand and ran down to the lagoon.\n\n\"Breached across!\" Mulhall exclaimed. \"That's something for a starter.\nThere she comes again!\"\n\nThe wreck of the shed was now flung up and left on the sand-crest, A\nthird wave buffeted it into fragments which washed down the slope toward\nthe lagoon.\n\n\"If she blow I would as be cooler yet,\" Hermann grunted. \"No longer can\nI breathe. It is damn hot. I am dry like a stove.\"\n\nHe chopped open a drinking cocoanut with his heavy sheath-knife and\ndrained the contents. The rest of them followed his example, pausing\nonce to watch one of Parlay's shell sheds go down in ruin. The barometer\nnow registered 29:50.\n\n\"Must be pretty close to the centre of the area of low pressure,\" Grief\nremarked cheerfully. \"I was never through the eye of a hurricane before.\nIt will be an experience for you, too, Mulhall. From the speed the\nbarometer's dropped, it's going to be a big one.\"\n\nCaptain Warfield groaned, and all eyes drew to him. He was looking\nthrough the glasses down the length of the lagoon to the southeast.\n\n\"There she comes,\" he said quietly.\n\nThey did not need glasses to see. A flying film, strangely marked,\nseemed drawing over the surface of the lagoon. Abreast of it, along the\natoll, travelling with equal speed, was a stiff bending of the cocoanut\npalms and a blur of flying leaves. The front of the wind on the water\nwas a solid, sharply defined strip of dark-coloured, wind-vexed water.\nIn advance of this strip, like skirmishers, were flashes of windflaws.\nBehind this strip, a quarter of a mile in width, was a strip of what\nseemed glassy calm. Next came another dark strip of wind, and behind\nthat the lagoon was all crisping, boiling whiteness.\n\n\"What is that calm streak?\" Mulhall asked.\n\n\"Calm,\" Warfield answered.\n\n\"But it travels as fast as the wind,\" was the other's objection.\n\n\"It has to, or it would be overtaken and it wouldn't be any calm. It's\na double-header, I saw a big squall like that off Savaii once. A regular\ndouble-header. Smash! it hit us, then it lulled to nothing, and smashed\nus a second time. Stand by and hold on! Here she is on top of us. Look\nat the _Roberta!_\"\n\nThe Roberta, lying nearest to the wind at slack chains, was swept off\nbroadside like a straw. Then her chains brought her up, bow on to the\nwind, with an astonishing jerk. Schooner after schooner, the _Malahini_\nwith them, was now sweeping away with the first gust and fetching up\non taut chains. Mulhall and several of the Kanakas were taken off their\nfeet when the _Malahini_ jerked to her anchors.\n\nAnd then there was no wind. The flying calm streak had reached\nthem. Grief lighted a match, and the unshielded flame burned without\nflickering in the still air. A very dim twilight prevailed. The\ncloud-sky, lowering as it had been for hours, seemed now to have\ndescended quite down upon the sea.\n\nThe Roberta tightened to her chains when the second head of the\nhurricane hit, as did schooner after schooner in swift succession. The\nsea, white with fury, boiled in tiny, spitting wavelets. The deck of the\n_Malahini_ vibrated under the men's feet. The taut-stretched halyards\nbeat a tattoo against the masts, and all the rigging, as if smote by\nsome mighty hand, set up a wild thrumming. It was impossible to face the\nwind and breathe. Mulhall, crouching with the others behind the shelter\nof the cabin, discovered this, and his lungs were filled in an instant\nwith so great a volume of driven air which he could not expel that he\nnearly strangled ere he could turn his head away.\n\n\"It's incredible,\" he gasped, but no one heard him.\n\nHermann and several Kanakas were crawling for'ard on hands and knees to\nlet go the third anchor. Grief touched Captain Warfield and pointed to\nthe _Roberta_. She was dragging down upon them. Warfield put his mouth\nto Grief's ear and shouted:\n\n\"We're dragging, too!\"\n\nGrief sprang to the wheel and put it hard over, veering the _Mahhini_\nto port. The third anchor took hold, and the _Roberta_ went by,\nstern-first, a dozen yards away. They waved their hands to Peter Gee\nand Captain Robinson, who, with a number of sailors, were at work on the\nbow.\n\n\"He's knocking out the shackles!\" Grief shouted. \"Going to chance the\npassage! Got to! Anchors skating!\"\n\n\"We're holding now!\" came the answering shout. \"There goes the _Cactus_\ndown on the _Misi_. That settles them!\"\n\nThe _Misi_ had been holding, but the added windage of the _Cactus_\nwas too much, and the entangled schooners slid away across the boiling\nwhite. Their men could be seen chopping and fighting to get them apart.\nThe _Roberta_, cleared of her anchors, with a patch of tarpaulin set\nfor'ard, was heading for the passage at the northwestern end of the\nlagoon. They saw her make it and drive out to sea. But the _Misi_ and\n_Cactus_, unable to get clear of each other, went ashore on the atoll\nhalf a mile from the passage. The wind merely increased on itself and\ncontinued to increase. To face the full blast of it required all one's\nstrength, and several minutes of crawling on deck against it tired a man\nto exhaustion. Hermann, with his Kanakas, plodded steadily, lashing and\nmaking secure, putting ever more gaskets on the sails. The wind ripped\nand tore their thin undershirts from their backs. They moved slowly, as\nif their bodies weighed tons, never releasing a hand-hold until another\nhad been secured. Loose ends of rope stood out stiffly horizontal, and,\nwhen a whipping gave, the loose end frazzled and blew away.\n\nMulhall touched one and then another and pointed to the shore. The\ngrass-sheds had disappeared, and Parlay's house rocked drunkenly,\nBecause the wind blew lengthwise along the atoll, the house had been\nsheltered by the miles of cocoanut trees. But the big seas, breaking\nacross from outside, were undermining it and hammering it to pieces.\nAlready tilted down the slope of sand, its end was imminent. Here and\nthere in the cocoanut trees people had lashed themselves. The trees did\nnot sway or thresh about. Bent over rigidly from the wind, they remained\nin that position and vibrated monstrously. Underneath, across the sand,\nsurged the white spume of the breakers. A big sea was likewise making\ndown the length of the lagoon. It had plenty of room to kick up in\nthe ten-mile stretch from the windward rim of the atoll, and all the\nschooners were bucking and plunging into it. The _Malahini_ had begun\nshoving her bow and fo'c'sle head under the bigger ones, and at times\nher waist was filled rail-high with water.\n\n\"Now's the time for your engine!\" Grief bellowed; and Captain Warfield,\ncrawling over to where the engineer lay, shouted emphatic commands.\n\nUnder the engine, going full speed ahead, the _Malahini_ behaved better.\nWhile she continued to ship seas over her bow, she was not jerked down\nso fiercely by her anchors. On the other hand, she was unable to get any\nslack in the chains. The best her forty horsepower could do was to ease\nthe strain.\n\nStill the wind increased. The little _Nuhiva_, lying abreast of the\n_Malahini_ and closer in to the beach, her engine still unrepaired and\nher captain ashore, was having a bad time of it. She buried herself so\nfrequently and so deeply that they wondered each time if she could clear\nherself of the water. At three in the afternoon buried by a second sea\nbefore she could free herself of the preceding one, she did not come up.\n\nMulhall looked at Grief.\n\n\"Burst in her hatches,\" was the bellowed answer.\n\nCaptain Warfield pointed to the _Winifred_, a little schooner plunging\nand burying outside of them, and shouted in Grief's ear. His voice came\nin patches of dim words, with intervals of silence when whisked away by\nthe roaring wind.\n\n\"Rotten little tub... Anchors hold... But how she holds together... Old\nas the ark----\"\n\nAn hour later Hermann pointed to her. Her for'ard bitts, foremast, and\nmost of her bow were gone, having been jerked out of her by her anchors.\nShe swung broadside, rolling in the trough and settling by the head, and\nin this plight was swept away to leeward.\n\nFive vessels now remained, and of them the _Malahini_ was the only one\nwith an engine. Fearing either the _Nuhiva's_ or the _Winifdred's_\nfate, two of them followed the _Roberta's_ example, knocking out the\nchain-shackles and running for the passage. The _Dolly_ was the first,\nbut her tarpaulin was carried away, and she went to destruction on the\nlee-rim of the atoll near the _Misi_ and the _Cactus_. Undeterred by\nthis, the _Moana_ let go and followed with the same result.\n\n\"Pretty good engine that, eh?\" Captain Warfield yelled to his owner.\n\nGrief put out his hand and shook. \"She's paying for herself!\" he yelled\nback. \"The wind's shifting around to the southward, and we ought to lie\neasier!\"\n\nSlowly and steadily, but with ever-increasing velocity, the wind veered\naround to the south and the southwest, till the three schooners that\nwere left pointed directly in toward the beach. The wreck of Parlay's\nhouse was picked up, hurled into the lagoon, and blown out upon them.\nPassing the _Malahini_, it crashed into the _Papara_, lying a quarter of\na mile astern. There was wild work for'ard on her, and in a quarter of\nan hour the house went clear, but it had taken the _Papara's_ foremast\nand bowsprit with it.\n\nInshore, on their port bow, lay the _Tahaa_, slim and yacht-like,\nbut excessively oversparred. Her anchors still held, but her captain,\nfinding no abatement in the wind, proceeded to reduce windage by\nchopping down his masts.\n\n\"Pretty good engine that,\" Grief congratulated his skipper, \"It will\nsave our sticks for us yet.\"\n\nCaptain Warfield shook his head dubiously.\n\nThe sea on the lagoon went swiftly down with the change of wind, but\nthey were beginning to feel the heave and lift of the outer sea breaking\nacross the atoll. There were not so many trees remaining. Some had been\nbroken short off, others uprooted. One tree they saw snap off halfway\nup, three persons clinging to it, and whirl away by the wind into the\nlagoon. Two detached themselves from it and swam to the Tahaa. Not\nlong after, just before darkness, they saw one jump overboard from that\nschooner's stern and strike out strongly for the Malahini through the\nwhite, spitting wavelets.\n\n\"It's Tai-Hotauri,\" was Grief's judgment. \"Now we'll have the news.\"\n\nThe Kanaka caught the bobstay, climbed over the bow, and crawled aft.\nTime was given him to breathe, and then, behind the part shelter of the\ncabin, in broken snatches and largely by signs, he told his story.\n\n\"Narii... damn robber... He want steal... pearls... Kill Parlay... One\nman kill Parlay... No man know what man... Three Kanakas, Narii, me...\nFive beans... hat... Narii say one bean black... Nobody know... Kill\nParlay... Narii damn liar... All beans black... Five black... Copra-shed\ndark... Every man get black bean... Big wind come... No chance...\nEverybody get up tree... No good luck them pearls... I tell you\nbefore... No good luck.\"\n\n\"Where's Parlay?\" Grief shouted.\n\n\"Up tree... Three of his Kanakas same tree. Narii and one Kanaka'nother\ntree... My tree blow to hell, then I come on board.\"\n\n\"Where's the pearls?\"\n\n\"Up tree along Parlay. Mebbe Narii get them pearl yet.\"\n\nIn the ear of one after another Grief passed on Tai-Hotauri's story.\nCaptain Warfield was particularly incensed, and they could see him\ngrinding his teeth.\n\nHermann went below and returned with a riding light, but the moment it\nwas lifted above the level of the cabin wall the wind blew it out. He\nhad better success with the binnacle lamp, which was lighted only after\nmany collective attempts.\n\n\"A fine night of wind!\" Grief yelled in Mulhall's ear. \"And blowing\nharder all the time.\"\n\n\"How hard?\"\n\n\"A hundred miles an hour... two hundred... I don't know... Harder than\nI've ever seen it.\"\n\nThe lagoon grew more and more troubled by the sea that swept across\nthe atoll. Hundreds of leagues of ocean was being backed up by the\nhurricane, which more than overcame the lowering effect of the ebb tide.\nImmediately the tide began to rise the increase in the size of the seas\nwas noticeable. Moon and wind were heaping the South Pacific on Hikihoho\natoll.\n\nCaptain Warfield returned from one of his periodical trips to the engine\nroom with the word that the engineer lay in a faint.\n\n\"Can't let that engine stop!\" he concluded helplessly.\n\n\"All right!\" Grief said, \"Bring him on deck. I'll spell him.\"\n\nThe hatch to the engine room was battened down, access being gained\nthrough a narrow passage from the cabin. The heat and gas fumes were\nstifling. Grief took one hasty, comprehensive examination of the engine\nand the fittings of the tiny room, then blew out the oil-lamp. After\nthat he worked in darkness, save for the glow from endless cigars which\nhe went into the cabin to light. Even-tempered as he was, he soon began\nto give evidences of the strain of being pent in with a mechanical\nmonster that toiled, and sobbed, and slubbered in the shouting dark.\nNaked to the waist, covered with grease and oil, bruised and skinned\nfrom being knocked about by the plunging, jumping vessel, his head\nswimming from the mixture of gas and air he was compelled to breathe,\nhe laboured on hour after hour, in turns petting, blessing, nursing, and\ncursing the engine and all its parts. The ignition began to go bad. The\nfeed grew worse. And worst of all, the cylinders began to heat. In\na consultation held in the cabin the half-caste engineer begged and\npleaded to stop the engine for half an hour in order to cool it and\nto attend to the water circulation. Captain Warfield was against any\nstopping. The half-caste swore that the engine would ruin itself and\nstop anyway and for good. Grief, with glaring eyes, greasy and battered,\nyelled and cursed them both down and issued commands. Mulhall,\nthe supercargo, and Hermann were set to work in the cabin at\ndouble-straining and triple-straining the gasoline. A hole was chopped\nthrough the engine room floor, and a Kanaka heaved bilge-water over the\ncylinders, while Grief continued to souse running parts in oil.\n\n\"Didn't know you were a gasoline expert,\" Captain Warfield admired when\nGrief came into the cabin to catch a breath of little less impure air.\n\n\"I bathe in gasoline,\" he grated savagely through his teeth. \"I eat it.\"\n\nWhat other uses he might have found for it were never given, for at that\nmoment all the men in the cabin, as well as the gasoline being strained,\nwere smashed forward against the bulkhead as the _Malahini_ took an\nabrupt, deep dive. For the space of several minutes, unable to gain\ntheir feet, they rolled back and forth and pounded and hammered from\nwall to wall. The schooner, swept by three big seas, creaked and groaned\nand quivered, and from the weight of water on her decks behaved logily.\nGrief crept to the engine, while Captain Warfield waited his chance to\nget through the companion-way and out on deck.\n\nIt was half an hour before he came back.\n\n\"Whaleboat's gone!\" he reported. \"Galley's gone! Everything gone except\nthe deck and hatches! And if that engine hadn't been going we'd be gone!\nKeep up the good work!\"\n\nBy midnight the engineer's lungs and head had been sufficiently cleared\nof gas fumes to let him relieve Grief, who went on deck to get his own\nhead and lungs clear. He joined the others, who crouched behind\nthe cabin, holding on with their hands and made doubly secure by\nrope-lashings. It was a complicated huddle, for it was the only place\nof refuge for the Kanakas. Some of them had accepted the skipper's\ninvitation into the cabin but had been driven out by the fumes. The\n_Malahini_ was being plunged down and swept frequently, and what they\nbreathed was air and spray and water commingled.\n\n\"Making heavy weather of it, Mulhall!\" Grief shouted to his guest\nbetween immersions.\n\nMulhall, strangling and choking, could only nod. The scuppers could not\ncarry off the burden of water on the schooner's deck. She rolled it out\nand took it in over one rail and the other; and at times, nose thrown\nskyward, sitting down on her heel, she avalanched it aft. It surged\nalong the poop gangways, poured over the top of the cabin, submerging\nand bruising those that clung on, and went out over the stern-rail.\n\nMulhall saw him first, and drew Grief's attention. It was Narii Herring,\ncrouching and holding on where the dim binnacle light shone upon him. He\nwas quite naked, save for a belt and a bare-bladed knife thrust between\nit and the skin.\n\nCaptain Warfield untied his lashings and made his way over the bodies of\nthe others. When his face became visible in the light from the binnacle\nit was working with anger. They could see him speak, but the wind tore\nthe sound away. He would not put his lips to Narii's ear. Instead, he\npointed over the side. Narii Herring understood. His white teeth showed\nin an amused and sneering smile, and he stood up, a magnificent figure\nof a man.\n\n\"It's murder!\" Mulhall yelled to Grief.\n\n\"He'd have murdered Old Parlay!\" Grief yelled back.\n\nFor the moment the poop was clear of water and the _Malahini_ on an even\nkeel. Narii made a bravado attempt to walk to the rail, but was flung\ndown by the wind. Thereafter he crawled, disappearing in the darkness,\nthough there was certitude in all of them that he had gone over the\nside. The Malahini dived deep, and when they emerged from the flood that\nswept aft, Grief got Mulhall's ear.\n\n\"Can't lose him! He's the Fish Man of Tahiti! He'll cross the lagoon and\nland on the other rim of the atoll if there's any atoll left!\"\n\nFive minutes afterward, in another submergence, a mess of bodies poured\ndown on them over the top of the cabin. These they seized and held\ntill the water cleared, when they carried them below and learned their\nidentity. Old Parlay lay oh his back on the floor, with closed eyes and\nwithout movement. The other two were his Kanaka cousins. All three were\nnaked and bloody. The arm of one Kanaka hung helpless and broken at his\nside. The other man bled freely from a hideous scalp wound.\n\n\"Narii did that?\" Mulhall demanded.\n\nGrief shook his head. \"No; it's from being smashed along the deck and\nover the house!\"\n\nSomething suddenly ceased, leaving them in dizzying uncertainty. For\nthe moment it was hard to realize there was no wind. With the absolute\nabruptness of a sword slash, the wind had been chopped off. The schooner\nrolled and plunged, fetching up on her anchors with a crash which for\nthe first time they could hear. Also, for the first time they could hear\nthe water washing about on deck. The engineer threw off the propeller\nand eased the engine down.\n\n\"We're in the dead centre,\" Grief said. \"Now for the shift. It will come\nas hard as ever.\" He looked at the barometer. \"29:32,\" he read.\n\nNot in a moment could he tone down the voice which for hours had battled\nagainst the wind, and so loudly did he speak that in the quiet it hurt\nthe others' ears.\n\n\"All his ribs are smashed,\" the supercargo said, feeling along Parlay's\nside. \"He's still breathing, but he's a goner.\"\n\nOld Parlay groaned, moved one arm impotently, and opened his eyes. In\nthem was the light of recognition.\n\n\"My brave gentlemen,\" he whispered haltingly. \"Don't forget... the\nauction... at ten o'clock... in hell.\"\n\nHis eyes dropped shut and the lower jaw threatened to drop, but he\nmastered the qualms of dissolution long enough to omit one final, loud,\nderisive cackle.\n\nAbove and below pandemonium broke out.\n\nThe old familiar roar of the wind was with them. The _Malahini_, caught\nbroadside, was pressed down almost on her beam ends as she swung the\narc compelled by her anchors. They rounded her into the wind, where she\njerked to an even keel. The propeller was thrown on, and the engine took\nup its work again.\n\n\"Northwest!\" Captain Warfield shouted to Grief when he came on deck.\n\"Hauled eight points like a shot!\"\n\n\"Narii'll never get across the lagoon now!\" Grief observed.\n\n\"Then he'll blow back to our side, worse luck!\"\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nAfter the passing of the centre the barometer began to rise. Equally\nrapid was the fall of the wind. When it was no more than a howling\ngale, the engine lifted up in the air, parted its bed-plates with a last\nconvulsive effort of its forty horsepower, and lay down on its side.\nA wash of water from the bilge sizzled over it and the steam arose in\nclouds. The engineer wailed his dismay, but Grief glanced over the wreck\naffectionately and went into the cabin to swab the grease off his chest\nand arms with bunches of cotton waste.\n\nThe sun was up and the gentlest of summer breezes blowing when he came\non deck, after sewing up the scalp of one Kanaka and setting the other's\narm. The _Malahini_ lay close in to the beach. For'ard, Hermann and the\ncrew were heaving in and straightening out the tangle of anchors. The\n_Papara_ and the _Tahaa_ were gone, and Captain Warfield, through the\nglasses, was searching the opposite rim of the atoll.\n\n\"Not a stick left of them,\" he said. \"That's what comes of not having\nengines. They must have dragged across before the big shift came.\"\n\nAshore, where Parlay's house had been, was no vestige of any house. For\nthe space of three hundred yards, where the sea had breached, no tree or\neven stump was left. Here and there, farther along, stood an occasional\npalm, and there were numbers which had been snapped off above the\nground. In the crown of one surviving palm Tai-Hotauri asserted he saw\nsomething move. There were no boats left to the _Malahini_, and they\nwatched him swim ashore and climb the tree.\n\nWhen he came back, they helped over the rail a young native girl of\nParley's household. But first she passed up to them a battered basket.\nIn it was a litter of blind kittens--all dead save one, that feebly\nmewed and staggered on awkward legs.\n\n\"Hello!\" said Mulhall. \"Who's that?\"\n\nAlong the beach they saw a man walking. He moved casually, as if out\nfor a morning stroll. Captain Warfield gritted his teeth. It was Narii\nHerring.\n\n\"Hello, skipper!\" Narii called, when he was abreast of them. \"Can I come\naboard and get some breakfast?\"\n\nCaptain Warfield's face and neck began to swell and turn purple. He\ntried to speak, but choked.\n\n\"For two cents--for two cents----\" was all he could manage to\narticulate.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of A Son Of The Sun, by Jack London\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A SON OF THE SUN ***\n\n***** This file should be named 21971-8.txt or 21971-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/2\/1\/9\/7\/21971\/\n\nProduced by David Widger\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":548,"split":"train"}
