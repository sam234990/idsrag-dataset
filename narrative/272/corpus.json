The next day, rather than settle into the new house, he decides to climb the mountains. Upon reaching the summit, he encounters the Phoenix. At first they are frightened of each other, as the Phoenix had been chased by a Scientist for several weeks and David had, of course, never seen anything like the Phoenix before. The Phoenix seems quite flattered by David's attentions, and takes a shine to him. Thus, the Phoenix decides that he should educate David about the various legendary creatures in the world to round out his knowledge. But years of hiding from scientists have made the Phoenix's wings flabby, and David has to coach the rather comical bird on his flying.\nThe first adventure in the Phoenix's curriculum for David involves seeing the Gryffins, said to be the friendliest of three similar races: the Gryffins, Gryffons, and Gryffens). On this journey, they first meet a Witch who goads the Phoenix into a race, which he later wins. Though David never actually meets a Gryffin on his first journey, the Phoenix attempts to talk to a lazy Gryffen. But they get captured by the violent and arrogant Gryffons, who sentence the Phoenix to death for bringing humans into their magic world.\nAfter escaping the Gryffon Cave through combined ingenuity, the Phoenix keeps his appointment with the Witch. David returns home to meet the unpleasant Scientist visiting his parents. David's evasiveness makes the villain suspicious. David warns the Phoenix as he unceremoniously shows up later that night, exhausted from his race. The two friends begin implementing various plans to avoid the Scientist, firstly by finding some buried treasure with the help of a gruff, but friendly Sea Monster, and spending the gold coins on magic items to foil the Scientist's plot to capture the rare bird.\nWhile visiting the magical world to buy necessities, David has a brief adventure with a prankster Leprechaun, meets a cantankerous potion-selling Hag, and even makes friends with a Faun, who races and plays with the boy before joining his people for an alluring dance in the Forest. However, the Phoenix rescues David from remaining too long in this world, which could absorb those beings who are not magical.\nUsing their collected magical items, the Phoenix and David sabotage the Scientist's equipment and frighten him into leaving town\u00e2\u0080\u0094at least for the moment. However, the old Phoenix celebrates his 500th birthday, and soon reveals he must \"bow to tradition,\" and build himself a pyre of cinnamon logs. David tearfully complies with his friend's wishes, buying the necessary items from town.\nUnfortunately, the Scientist shows up and follows David up the mountain trails. The Phoenix is reborn, but as a hatchling, does not yet comprehend its peril. David appeals to the young Phoenix, who dimly recognizes a friend, and flies away to avoid captivity. David watches as the Old Phoenix's token, a blue feather, changes to a golden hue.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of David and the Phoenix, by Edward Ormondroyd\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

When the car finally stopped,\nthe rest of them got out stiffly and went into the new house. But\nDavid walked slowly into the back yard with his eyes fixed on the\nground. For a whole minute he stood there, not daring to look up. Then\nhe took a deep breath, clenched his hands tightly, and lifted his\nhead.\n\nThere it was!--as Dad had described it, but infinitely more grand. It\nswept upward from the valley floor, beautifully shaped and soaring, so\ntall that its misty blue peak could surely talk face to face with the\nstars. To David, who had never seen a mountain before, the sight was\nalmost too much to bear. He felt so tight and shivery inside that he\ndidn't know whether he wanted to laugh, or cry, or both. And the\nreally wonderful thing about the mountain was the way it _looked_ at\nhim. He was certain that it was smiling at him, like an old friend who\nhad been waiting for years to see him again. And when he closed his\neyes, he seemed to hear a voice which whispered, \"Come along, then,\nand climb.\"\n\nIt would be so easy to go! The back yard was hedged in (with part of\nthe hedge growing right across the toes of the mountain), but there\nwas a hole in the privet large enough to crawl through. And just\nbeyond the hedge the mountainside awaited him, going up and up in one\nsmooth sweep until the green and tawny faded into hazy heights of\nrock. It was waiting for him. \"Come and climb,\" it whispered, \"come\nand climb.\"\n\nBut there was a great deal to do first. They were going to move into\nthe new house. The moving van was standing out in front, the car must\nbe unloaded. David would be needed to carry things. Regretfully, he\nwaved his hand at the peak and whispered, \"It shouldn't take\nlong--I'll be back as soon as I can.\" Then he went around to the front\ndoor to see what could be done about speeding things up.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nInside, everything was in confusion. Dad was pushing chairs and\ntables around in an aimless way. Mother was saying, \"They'll all have\nto go out again; we forgot to put down the rug first.\" Aunt Amy was\nmaking short dashes between the kitchen and the dining room, muttering\nto herself. And Beckie was roaring in her crib because it was time for\nher bottle. David asked, \"Can I do anything?\"--hoping that the answer\nwould be no.\n\n\"C'mere,\" Aunt Amy said, grabbing him by the arm. \"Help me look for\nthat ironing board.\"\n\nWhen the ironing board was finally located, Mother had something for\nhim to do. And when he was finished with that, Dad called for his\nhelp. So the afternoon wore on without letup--and also without any\nsigns of progress in their moving. When David finally got a chance to\nsneak out for a breathing spell, he felt his heart sink. Somehow, in\nall the rush and confusion, the afternoon had disappeared. Already the\nevening sun was throwing shadows across the side of the mountain and\ntouching its peak with a ruddy blaze. It was too late now. He would\nhave to wait until morning before he could climb.\n\nAs he gazed up miserably at the glowing summit, he thought he saw a\ntiny speck soar out from it in a brief circle. Was it a bird of some\nsort, or just one of those dots that swim before your eyes when you\nstare too long at the sky? It almost seemed like the mountain waving\nits hand, as if to say that it was quite all right for him to wait\nuntil morning. He felt better then, and returned more cheerfully to\nthe moving.\n\nIt was long after dark before the moving van drove away. Beckie\ncrooned happily over her bottle, and the rest of them gathered in the\nkitchen for a late supper of sandwiches and canned soup. But David\ncould not eat until he had found the courage to ask one question:\n\n\"May I climb the mountain tomorrow?\"\n\nAunt Amy muttered something about landslides, which were firmly fixed\nin her mind as the fate of people who climbed mountains. But Dad said,\n\"I don't see why not, do you?\" and looked to Mother for agreement.\n\nMother said, \"Well ... be very careful,\" in a doubtful tone, and that\nwas that.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nYou never know what you will find when you climb a mountain, even if\nyou have climbed them before--which, of course, David never had.\nLooking up from the foot of the mountain, he had thought that it was a\nsmooth slope from bottom to top. But he was discovering as he climbed\nthat it was not smooth at all, but very much broken up. There were\nterraces, ledges, knolls, ravines, and embankments, one after\nanother. The exciting part of it was that each feature concealed the\nones above it. At the top of a rise would be an outcropping of\nstrangely colored rock, invisible from below. Beyond the outcropping,\na small stand of aspens would quiver in the breeze, their quicksilver\nleaves hiding a tiny meadow on the slope behind. And when the meadow\nhad been discovered, there would be a something else beyond. He was a\nreal explorer now. When he got to the top, he thought, he would build\na little tower of stones, the way explorers always do.\n\nBut at the end of two hours' steady climbing, he was ready to admit\nthat he would never reach the peak that day. It still rose above his\nhead, seeming as far distant as ever. But he did not care now. It had\nbeen a glorious climb, and the distance he had already covered was a\nconsiderable one. He looked back. The town looked like a model of a\ntown, with little toy houses and different-colored roofs among the\ntrees that made a darker patch on the pattern of the valley floor. The\nmountains on the other side of the valley seemed like blue clouds\nstretching out over the edge of the world. Even the peak could not\ngive him a better view than this.\n\nDavid gazed up the face of a scarp which rose like a cliff above\nhim--a smooth, bare wall of rock that had halted his climb. Halfway\nup the scarp was a dark horizontal line of bushes, something like a\nhedge. Apparently there was a ledge or shelf there, and he decided to\nclimb up to it before he returned home. To scale the rock face itself\nwas impossible, however: there were no hand or foot holds. So he\nturned and made his way through the grass until he reached the end of\nthe bare stone. Then he started upward again. It was hard work. Vines\nclutched at his feet, and the close-set bushes seemed unwilling to let\nhim pass. He had one nasty slip, which might have been his last if he\nhad not grabbed a tough clump of weeds at the crucial instant.\n\nBut, oh! it was worth it. He felt like shouting when at last he\nreached the ledge. Truly it was an enchanted place! It was a long,\nlevel strip of ground, several yards wide, carpeted with short grass\nand dandelions. Bushes grew along most of the outer edge. The inner\nedge was bounded by a second scarp--a wall of red stone with sparkling\npoints of light imbedded in its smooth surface.\n\nDavid threw himself on the grass and rolled in it. It was warm and\nsoft and sweet-smelling; it soothed away the hurt of his aching\nmuscles and the sting of his scratches. He rolled over on his back and\ncushioned his head in his hands. The sky seemed to be slipping along\noverhead like a broad blue river. The breeze ruffled his hair and\nwhispered, the bushes murmured and gossiped to each other. Even the\nsunlight seemed to hum to him as it laid warm hands on his face.\n\nBut there was another sound, which now and then rose above these\nmurmurs. Then it would fade and be drowned out by the breeze. Hard to\nsay why, but it just did not seem to fit there. David propped himself\nup on his elbows and listened more intently. The sound faded: he had\nbeen imagining it. No, he had not been imagining it--there it was\nagain. He sat up. Now he noticed that the ledge was divided by a\nthicket which grew from the inner side to the outer. The noise,\nwhatever it was, came from the other side of the thicket.\n\nDavid's curiosity was aroused, but it occurred to him that it might be\nwise to be cautious. The noise did not sound dangerous, but--well, he\nhad never been up a mountain before, and there was no telling what he\nmight find. He dropped into a crouch and crept silently up to the\ntangle of bushes. His heart began to pound, and he swallowed to\nrelieve the dryness in his throat. The noise was much more distinct\nnow, and it sounded like--like--yes, not only sounded like, but\n_was_--someone talking to himself.\n\nWho could it possibly be? Well, there was only one way to find out.\n\nHe dropped down on his stomach and carefully began to worm his way\nunder the thicket. The branches grew very low, and the ground was full\nof lumps and knobs which dug into him with every movement. There were\nvines, too, and some prickly things like thistles, which had to be\npushed out of the way without allowing their leaves to rustle. He\nprogressed by inches, pushing with his toes, pulling with his finger\ntips, wriggling with the rest of his body. At last he could see light\nbreaking through the foliage in front of him--he was nearing the other\nside. A bunch of leaves hung before his face. He hesitated, then\npushed them aside gently, slowly--and peered out.\n\nHe thought his heart would stop.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\n2: _In Which David Meets the Phoenix, and There Is a Change in Plans_\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\nThere stood an enormous bird.\n\nDavid had been to the zoo, and at home he had a book of birds with\ncolored pictures. He knew the more common large birds of the world:\nthe ostrich, the condor, the albatross, eagles, cranes, storks. But\n_this_ bird--! Its shape was like that of an eagle, but stouter. Its\nneck had the length and elegant curve of a swan's neck. Its head was\nagain like an eagle's, with a hooked bird-of-prey beak, but the\nexpression in its brown eyes was mild. The long wings were blunt at\nthe tips, the tail was short and broad. The legs, feathered halfway\ndown, ended in taloned feet. An iridescent sheen sparkled on its\nplumage, reflecting sunlight from the scarlet crest, the golden neck\nand back, the breast of silver, the sapphire wings and tail. Its size\nalone would have been enough to take David's breath away. He could\nhave stood beneath the arch of that neck with room to spare.\n\nBut the most astonishing thing was that the bird had an open book on\nthe ground and was apparently trying to learn part of it by heart.\n\n\"_Vivo, vives, vive_,\" the bird read, very slowly and distinctly,\nstaring hard at the book. \"_Vivimos, viv\u00c3\u00ads, viven._ _That_ is simple\nenough, you blockhead! Now, then, without looking.\" It cleared its\nthroat, looked away from the book, and repeated in a rapid mutter:\n\"_Vivo vives vive vi_--ah--_vivi_--oh, dear, what _is_ the matter with\nme?\" Here the temptation to peek overcame it for an instant, and its\nhead wavered. But it said, \"No, no!\" in a firm tone, looked carefully\nthe other way, and began once more.\n\n\"_Vivo, vives, vive_--quite correct so far. Ah--_vi_--ah--Oh, dear,\nthese verbs! Where was I? Oh, yes. _Vivo_--\"\n\nDavid's head reeled as he watched this amazing performance. There was\nno need to pinch himself to see if he were dreaming: he was perfectly\nwide awake. Everything else around him was behaving in a normal way.\nThe mountain was solid beneath him, the sunlight streamed down as\nbefore. Yet there was the bird, unmistakably before him, undeniably\nstudying its book and speaking to itself. David's mind caught hold of\na phrase and repeated it over and over again: \"What on _earth_? What\non _earth_?\" But of course there was no answer to that question. And\nhe might have lain hidden there all day, staring out at the bird and\nmarveling, had it not been for a bee which came droning into the\nthicket straight for him.\n\nHe had a horror of bees, ever since he had once bumped into a hive by\nmistake. When he heard that dread sound approaching, his whole body\nbroke into a sweat. All thought of the bird was immediately driven\nfrom his head. He could tell from the noise that it was one of those\nbig black-and-yellow fuzzy bees, the ones with the nasty dispositions.\nPerhaps--the thought paralyzed him--perhaps he was lying on its nest.\nOn it came, buzzing and blundering through the leaves. Suddenly it\nwas upon him, so close that he could feel the tiny breeze stirred up\nby its wings. All self-control vanished. He beat at it wildly with his\nhands, burst out of the thicket like an explosion, and smashed full\ntilt into the bird before he could stop himself.\n\nWith a piercing squawk the bird shot into the air, flipped over, and\ncame fluttering down facing him--talons outstretched, hooked beak\nopen, eyes a-glare. Completely terrified, David turned and bolted for\nthe thicket. He managed to thrash halfway through when a vine trapped\nhis feet. He pitched forward, shielding his face with his arms, and\nwas caught up short by a dead branch snagging his shirt.\n\nHe was stuck. This was the end. He closed his eyes and waited, too\nnumb with fear to think or cry out.\n\nNothing happened. Slowly he turned his head around. The bird, although\nit still glared menacingly, seemed undecided whether to attack or\nflee.\n\n\"What, may I ask, are you doing here?\" it said at last, in a severe\nvoice.\n\n\"I--I--I was taking a walk,\" David said faintly. \"I'm awfully sorry if\nI bothered you or anything.\"\n\n\"You should not have come up here at _all_,\" the bird snapped.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Well, I'm really sorry. But there was a bee in the bush here. I--I\ndidn't mean to....\" The fright had been too much. Tears started in\nDavid's eyes, and his lip began to tremble.\n\nThe bird seemed reassured, for its manner visibly softened. It lowered\nand folded its wings, and the glare faded from its eyes.\n\n\"I'd go away,\" David mumbled apologetically, \"only I'm stuck.\" He\nrubbed his eyes on his sleeve.\n\nThe bird looked at his dismal face and began to fidget awkwardly.\n\"There, there,\" it said. \"I had no intention of--I am afraid that\nI--Stuck, did you say? Very easily mended, my dear fellow! Merely a\nquestion of--Here, let me look.\" It crashed through the thicket to\nwhere David was caught and thrust its head down through the branches.\nIts muffled voice came floating up. \"Take heart! There seems to\nbe--aha! just so--One moment, please--bit of vine--_there_ we are!\"\nThere was a snapping sound from below, and David's foot was released.\nHe unstuck the snag from his shirt, pushed his way out of the thicket,\nand sat down weakly on the grass. Whew! At least the bird was not\ngoing to harm him. It seemed to be quite a kindly creature, really. He\nhad just frightened it and made it angry by bursting out of the bushes\nso suddenly.\n\nHe heard a flailing in the thicket, followed by the bird's anxious\nvoice: \"Hello! Are you still there?\"\n\n\"Yes. What--?\"\n\nThere were more sounds of struggle. \"This is rather awkward. I--the\nfact is, I am afraid, that I am stuck myself. Could you--\"\n\n\"Yes, of course,\" said David. He smiled to himself, a little shakily,\nand re-entered the thicket. When he had disentangled the bird, the two\nof them sat down on the grass and looked at each other. They\nhesitated, not quite sure how to begin.\n\n\"I trust,\" said the bird at last, \"that you are not of a scientific\nturn of mind?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said David. \"I'm interested in things, if that's what\nyou mean.\"\n\n\"No, it is not. There is a great deal of difference between the\ninterest shown by normal people and the obsessive interest of\nscientists. You are not, I hope, acquainted with any scientists?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said the bird, with a relieved sigh. \"Everything is quite all\nright, then. I do hope that you will forgive my behavior. I am not\nusually so rude. The fact is that you gave me quite a horrible start.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm sorry I frightened you.\"\n\n\"Frightened, my dear fellow?\" said the bird testily. \"I am never\nfrightened. I do not know the meaning of the word.\"\n\n\"What I mean is,\" David said quickly, \"that you frightened _me_.\" This\nseemed to pacify the bird; and David, to heighten the good\nimpression, added: \"Golly, you looked fierce.\"\n\nThe bird smiled complacently, \"I _can_ rise to a terrifying ferocity\nwhen aroused. A noble strain of fighting blood courses through my\nveins. Not that I go out of my way to seek quarrels, you understand.\nOn the contrary. 'Peaceful' could well describe my general attitude.\nMeditative. I am usually to be found Thinking. I have a powerful\nintellect. No doubt you have noticed the stamp of genius on my brow.\"\n\nDavid supposed that the bird meant its scarlet crest, and he nodded.\n\"That's one of the first things I noticed about you.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\" cried the bird delightedly. \"You are certainly more alert\nthan most! But, as I was saying, I am usually to be found Thinking.\nThe first condition of Thinking is solitude. And that, I fear, is a\ndesideratum most difficult of realization.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon?\"\n\n\"People,\" explained the bird, \"do not leave you alone.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said David. He flushed, thinking that the words had been aimed\nat him, and began to get up. But the bird signaled him to remain where\nhe was.\n\n\"I do not mean _you_, my dear fellow. I assure you that I am delighted\nto make your acquaintance. It is all the others. Do you know that I\nhave spent the greater part of my life being pursued? I was chased out\nof Egypt like a common game bird. Out of the mountains of Greece, too.\nThe hills of Lebanon, the desert of Africa, the Arabian wilds--no\nmatter where I fled, people would come prying and peering and sneaking\nafter me. I have tried Tibet, China, and the steppes of Siberia--with\nthe same result. At last I heard of a region where there was peace,\nwhere the inhabitants let each other alone. Here, I thought, I\nshould--\"\n\n\"Pardon me for interrupting. Where?\"\n\n\"Why, _here_, to be brief,\" said the bird, waving its wing toward the\nvalley. \"Here, I thought, I should be able to breathe. At _my_ age one\nlikes a little quiet. Would you believe that I am close to five\nhundred years old?\"\n\n\"Golly!\" said David. \"You don't look it.\"\n\nThe bird gave a pleased laugh. \"My splendid physical condition _does_\nconceal my years. At any rate, I settled here in the hope of being\nleft alone. But do you think I was safe?\"\n\nDavid, seeing that he was supposed to answer no, shook his head.\n\n\"Quite right,\" sighed the bird. \"I was not. I had been here no more\nthan three months when a Scientist was hot on my trail. A most\ndisagreeable fellow, always sneaking about with binoculars, a camera,\nand, I fear, a gun. That is why you startled me for an instant. I\nthought you were he.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" David cried, \"I'm awfully sorry. I didn't bother you on purpose.\nIt's just that I never saw a mountain before, so I climbed up here to\nsee what one looked like.\"\n\n\"You climbed up here?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Climbed,\" said the bird, looking very thoughtful. \"Climbed ... I\nmight have known.... It proves, you see, that the same thing could be\ndone again by someone older and stronger. A very grave point.\"\n\n\"Oh, I see,\" said David. \"You mean the--\"\n\n\"Precisely! The Scientist. He is, I fear, very persistent. I first\nnoticed him over there\"--the bird waved its wing toward the opposite\nside of the valley--\"so I removed to this location. But he will\nundoubtedly continue his pursuit. The bad penny always turns up. It\nwill not be long before the sharp scientific nose is again quivering\nin my direction.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear, that's terrible!\"\n\n\"Your sympathy touches me,\" said the bird huskily. \"It is most unusual\nto find someone who understands. But have no fear for me. I am taking\nsteps. I am preparing. Imagine his disappointment when he arrives here\nand finds me flown from the nest. I am, to be brief, leaving. Do you\nsee this book?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said David. \"I heard you reading it, but I couldn't understand\nit. Is it magic?\"\n\n\"No, my boy, it is Spanish. I have chosen a little spot (chilly, but\nisolated) in the Andes Mountains. South America, you know. And of\ncourse one must be prepared. I am learning Spanish so that I shall be\nable to make my way about in South America. I must admit my extreme\nreluctance to depart. I have become very fond of this ledge. It is\nexactly suited to my needs--ideal climate, magnificent view....\"\n\nThey fell into a lengthy silence. The bird gazed sadly out over the\nvalley, and David rested his chin in his hands and thought. The\nmystery was clearing up. The bird's presence on the mountain and the\nfact that it had been reading a book were explained. And so natural\nwas its speech that David found himself accepting it as nothing\nunusual. The thing that worried him now was that the bird would soon\nleave. Here they had only just met, and already the promise of a most\ninteresting friendship was dissolving. The bird had taken time to talk\nto him and explain things to him as though he were an equal. And\nalthough he did not understand many of the long words it used, he felt\npleased at being spoken to as though he did understand. And the bird\nknew all about faraway countries--had visited them and lived in them\nand had adventures in them for almost five hundred years. Oh, there\nwere so many things David wanted to know and ask about! But the bird\nwas leaving. If only he could persuade it to stay, even for a short\nwhile! He could try, anyhow--after all, the bird had said itself that\nit did not want to go.\n\n\"Bird--\" He stopped, and flushed. It was hard to put into words.\n\n\"Your servant, my boy.\"\n\n\"Well--I--I don't believe I know your name,\" David stammered, unable\nto get the real question out.\n\n\"Ah, forgive me!\" cried the bird, jumping up. \"Permit me the honor of\npresenting myself. I daresay my name is familiar to you, celebrated as\nit is in song and story. I am the one and only, the Unique, Phoenix.\"\nAnd the Phoenix bowed deeply.\n\n\"Very glad to meet you,\" said David. \"I'm David.\"\n\n\"Delighted, my dear fellow! An honor and a pleasure.\" They shook hand\nand wing solemnly. \"Now, as you were saying--?\"\n\n\"Well, Phoenix, I was just thinking,\" David stammered. \"It's too\nbad--I mean, couldn't you--it would be nice if we--Well, do you really\n_have_ to go to South America? It would be nice if you'd stay a while,\nuntil the Scientist shows up, anyway--and I like talking with you....\"\nHis face burned. It seemed like a lot to ask.\n\nThe Phoenix harrumphed several times in its throat and shuffled its\nfeet. \"Really, I cannot tell you how--how much you--well, really--such\na delightful request! Ah--harrumph! Perhaps it can be arranged.\"\n\n\"Oh, Phoenix!\" David threw his arms around the bird's neck and then,\nunable to restrain himself any longer, turned a somersault on the\ngrass.\n\n\"But for the present, it seems to be getting late,\" said the Phoenix.\n\"We shall talk it over some other time and decide.\"\n\n\"Golly, it _is_ late--I hadn't noticed. Well, I'll have to go, or\nthey'll worry about me at home. But I can come up and see you\ntomorrow, can't I?\"\n\n\"Of course, my boy! In the bustle of morning, in the hush of noon, in\nthe--ah--to be brief, at any time.\"\n\n\"And I'll bring you some cookies, if you like.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said the Phoenix, closing its eyes. \"Sugar cookies, by any\nchance?\" it asked faintly. David noticed the feathers of its throat\njumping up and down with rapid swallowing motions.\n\n\"I'll ask Aunt Amy to make some tonight.\"\n\n\"Ah, splendid, my boy! Splendid! Shall we say not more than--ah--that\nis, not _less_ than--ah--fifteen?\"\n\n\"All right, Phoenix. My Aunt Amy keeps a big jar full of cookies, and\nI can have as many as I like.\"\n\nThe Phoenix took David's arm, and together they strolled to the other\nend of the ledge.\n\n\"Now, don't mention this to anyone, but there is an old goat trail\ndown this side. It is somewhat grown over, but eyes as sharp as yours\nshould have no trouble with it. It will make your travels up and down\neasier. Another thing--I trust you will not make known our\nrendezvous?\"\n\n\"Our what?\"\n\n\"You will not tell anyone that I am here?\"\n\n\"Oh, no. I won't say a word! Well, I'll see you tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Yes. As the French so cleverly say it--ah--well, to be brief,\ngood-by, my boy. Until tomorrow, then.\"\n\nDavid waved his hand, found the goat trail, and started down. He was\ntoo happy even to whistle, so he contented himself with running\nwhenever he found a level place. And when he reached home, he stood on\nhis hands in the back yard for two whole seconds.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\n3: _In Which It Is Decided that David Should Have an Education, and an\nExperiment Is Made_\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\nNext day it took less than an hour to reach the ledge, and David was\nsure that he could shorten the time even more when he was familiar\nwith the goat trail.\n\nThe Phoenix was not in sight when he arrived, and for an instant David\nwas stricken with fright. Had the bird gone in spite of its promise?\nBut no--he heard a reassuring noise. It came from the thicket, and it\nsounded very much like a snore.\n\nDavid smiled to himself and shouted, \"Hello, Phoenix!\"\n\nThere was a thrashing sound in the thicket, and the Phoenix appeared,\nlooking very rumpled and yawning behind its wing.\n\n\"Greetings, my boy!\" it cried. \"A splendid morning!\" Then the Phoenix\ncaught sight of the paper bag in David's hand, and swallowed in a\nsuggestive way.\n\nDavid thrust the bag of cookies behind his back. \"Now, Phoenix,\" he\nsaid firmly, \"you have to promise me you won't go away to South\nAmerica. You said last night that it could be arranged, so let's\narrange it right now. Until we do, not one.\"\n\nThe Phoenix drew itself up indignantly. \"My very dear fellow,\" it\nsaid, \"you wound me. You cut me to the quick. I will not be bribed.\nI--\" It stopped and swallowed again. \"Oh, well,\" it continued, more\nmildly, \"one does not fight fate, does one? I suppose under these\ncircumstances, I must accept.\"\n\n\"It's settled, then!\" David cried joyfully.\n\nSo they sat down on the grass together, and for a long time nothing\nwas heard but sounds of munching.\n\n\"My boy,\" said the Phoenix at last, brushing the crumbs from its\nchest, \"I take a modest pride in my way with words, but nothing in the\nlanguage can do these--ah--baked poems justice. Words fail me.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you like them,\" David said politely.\n\n\"And now, my boy,\" continued the Phoenix, as it settled back\ncomfortably, \"I have been thinking. Yesterday you showed an\nintelligent interest in my problems and asked intelligent questions.\nYou did not scoff, as others might have done. You have very rare\nqualities.\"\n\nDavid flushed, and mumbled denials.\n\n\"Do not be so modest, my boy! I speak the truth. It came to me that\nsuch a mind as yours, having these qualities, should be further\ncultivated and refined. And I should be avoiding my clear-cut duty if\nI did not take this task in hand myself. Of course, I suppose some\nattempt to educate you has already been made, has it not?\"\n\n\"Well, I go to school, if that's what you mean. Not now, though,\nbecause it's summer vacation.\"\n\n\"And what do they teach you there?\"\n\n\"Oh, reading and writing and arithmetic, and things like that.\"\n\n\"Aha!\" said the Phoenix triumphantly. \"Just as I suspected--a\nclassical education. Understand me--I have nothing against a\nclassical education as such. I realize that mathematics, Greek, and\nLatin are excellent for the discipline of the mind. But in the broad\nview, a classical education is not a true education. Life is real,\nlife is earnest. One must face it with a _practical_ education. The\nproblems of Life, my dear fellow!--classical education completely\nignores them! For example, how do you tell a true Unicorn from a false\none?\"\n\n\"I--I don't know.\"\n\n\"I thought not. Where do you find the Philosopher's Stone?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I shall ask a simple one. What is the first rule of\ndefense when attacked by a Chimera?\"\n\nDavid squirmed uncomfortably. \"I'm afraid I don't know that, either,\"\nhe said in a small voice.\n\n\"There you are!\" cried the Phoenix. \"You do not have a true, practical\neducation--you are not ready for Life. I, my boy, am going to take\nyour education in hand.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said David. \"Do you mean--are you going to give me--lessons?\"\nThrough his mind flashed a picture of the Phoenix (with spectacles on\nits beak and a ruler in its wing) writing out sentences on a\nblackboard. The thought gave him a sinking feeling. After all, it was\nsummer--and summer was supposed to be vacation time.\n\n\"And what an education it will be!\" the Phoenix went on, ignoring his\nquestion. \"Absolutely without equal! The full benefit of my vast\nknowledge, plus a number of trips to--\"\n\n\"Oh, _traveling_!\" said David, suddenly feeling much better. \"That's\ndifferent. Oh, Phoenix, that'll be wonderful! Where will we go?\"\n\n\"Everywhere, my boy!\" said the Phoenix, with an airy wave of its wing.\n\"To all corners of the earth. We shall visit my friends and\nacquaintances.\"\n\n\"Oh, do you have--\"\n\n\"Of course, my boy! I am nothing if not a good mixer. My acquaintances\n(to mention but a few) include Fauns, Dragons, Unicorns, Trolls,\nGryffins, Gryffons, Gryffens--\"\n\n\"Excuse me,\" David interrupted. \"What were those last three, please?\"\n\n\"Gryffins,\" explained the Phoenix, \"are the small, reddish, friendly\nones. Gryffons are the quick-tempered proud ones. Gryffens--ah, well,\nthe most anyone can say for them is that they are harmless. They are\nvery stupid.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said David doubtfully. \"What do they look like?\"\n\n\"Each looks like the others, my boy, except that some are bigger and\nsome are smaller. But to continue: Sea Monsters, Leprechauns, Rocs,\nGnomes, Elves, Basilisks, Nymphs--ah--and many others. All are of the\nBetter Sort, since, as I have many times truly observed, one is known\nby the company one keeps. And your education will cost you nothing. Of\ncourse it _would_ be agreeable if you could supply me with cookies\nfrom time to time.\"\n\n\"As many as you want, Phoenix. Will we go to Africa?\"\n\n\"Naturally, my boy. Your education will include--\"\n\n\"And Egypt? And China? And Arabia?\"\n\n\"Yes. Your education will--\"\n\n\"Oh, Phoenix, Phoenix!\" David jumped up and began to caper, while the\nPhoenix beamed. But suddenly he stopped.\n\n\"How are we going to travel, Phoenix?\"\n\n\"I have wings, my boy.\"\n\n\"Yes, but I don't.\"\n\n\"Do not be so dense, my dear fellow. I shall carry you on my back, of\ncourse.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said David weakly, \"on your--on your back. Are you sure\nthat--isn't there some other--I mean, can you do it?\"\n\nThe Phoenix drew itself up to its full height. \"I am hurt--yes, deeply\nhurt--by your lack of faith. My magnificent build should make it\nevident that I am an exceedingly powerful flyer. In the heyday of my\nyouth I could fly around the world in five hours. But come along. I\nshall give you proof positive.\"\n\nDavid reluctantly followed the Phoenix to a spot on the edge of the\nshelf where there was a gap in the bushes. He glanced over the brink.\nThe sheer face of the scarp fell away beneath them, plunging down to\nthe tiny trees and rocks below. He stepped back quickly with a\nshudder.\n\n\"Let's--let's do it tomorrow,\" he quavered.\n\n\"Nonsense,\" said the Phoenix firmly. \"No time like the present. Now,\nthen, up on my back.\"\n\n\"H-h-how am I going to sit?\"\n\n\"On my back. Quite so--now, your arms around my neck--your legs\n_behind_ my wings, please--there we are. Ready?\"\n\n\"No,\" said David faintly.\n\n\"Splendid! The proof is to be demonstrated, the--to be brief, we are\noff!\"\n\nThe great wings were outstretched. David gulped, clutched the\nPhoenix's neck tightly, and shut his eyes. He felt a hopping\nsensation, then a long, sickening downward swoop that seemed to leave\nhis stomach far behind. A tremendous rush of air snatched at his\nshirt. He opened his eyes and choked with fright. The ground below was\nrushing up to meet them, swaying and revolving. Something was terribly\nwrong. The Phoenix was breathing in hoarse gasps; its wings were\npounding the air frantically. Now they had turned back. The scarp\nloomed before them, solid and blank. Above them--high above them--was\nthe ledge. It looked as though they would not get back to it.\n\nUp ... up ... up.... They crawled through the air. The wings flapped\nwildly, faster and faster. They were gaining--slipping back--gaining\nagain. The Phoenix sobbed as it stretched its neck in the last effort.\nFifty feet ... twenty feet ... ten.... With a tremendous surge of its\nwings, the Phoenix managed to get one claw over the edge and to seize\nthe branch of a bush in its beak. David's legs slipped from the bird's\nback. He dangled over the abyss from the outstretched neck, and\nprayed. The bush saved them. They scrabbled up over the edge, tottered\nthere for an instant, and dropped on the grass.\n\nFor a long time they lay gasping and trembling.\n\nAt last the Phoenix weakly raised its head. \"Puff--well, my boy--puff\npuff--whew!--very narrow squeak. I--puff--\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nDavid could not answer. The earth reeled under him and would not stop\nno matter how tightly he clutched the grass.\n\n\"Puff--I repeat, I am--puff--an exceedingly powerful flyer. There are\nfew birds--none, I daresay--who--puff--could have done even this\nmuch. The truth of the matter is that you are a lot--puff--heavier\nthan you look. I hope you are not being overfed at home?\"\n\n\"I--I don't know,\" said David, wondering whether or not he was going\nto be sick.\n\n\"Well, my course is clear,\" said the Phoenix firmly. \"I must practice.\nSetting-up exercises, roadwork, and what not. Rigorous diet. Lots of\nsleep. Regular hours. Courage, my dear fellow! We shall do it yet!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd so for the following week the Phoenix practiced.\n\nEvery morning David climbed up to the ledge, bringing sandwiches for\nhimself, cookies for the Phoenix, and a wet towel. Then, while he kept\ncount, the Phoenix did setting-up exercises. After this, the bird\nwould jog trot up and down the ledge and practice jumping. Then there\nwould be a fifteen-minute rest and refreshment period. And when that\nwas over, the Phoenix would launch itself into the air. This was the\npart David liked best. It was a magnificent sight. The Phoenix dashed\nback and forth at top speed, wheeled in circles, shot straight up like\na rocket--plunged, hovered, looped--rolled, soared, fluttered. Now and\nthen it would swoop back to the ledge beside David and wipe the sweat\nfrom its brow.\n\n\"I trust you see signs of progress, my boy?\"\n\nDavid would wrap the wet towel around the Phoenix's neck. \"You're\ndoing better and better, Phoenix. I especially like that part where\nyou twist over on your back and loop and plunge, all at the same\ntime.\"\n\n\"I do perform that rather well, don't I? It is not easy. But just the\nthing for acquiring (ouch!) muscle tone. Are there any more cookies?\nAh, there are. Delicious! As I was saying, let this be a lesson to\nyou, my boy. If at first you don't succeed, try, try again.\"\n\nThe Phoenix would take wing again. And David would settle back against\na rock and watch. Sometimes he thought of the education he was to get.\nSometimes he thought how nice it would be if _he_ could fly. And\nsometimes he did not think at all, but just sat with his eyes half\nshut, feeling the sunlight on his face and listening to the rustle of\nthe wind in the thicket.\n\nAt the end of the week the Phoenix, after a brilliant display of\nacrobatics, landed on the ledge, clasped its wings behind its back,\nand looked solemnly at David.\n\n\"Well, my boy,\" it said, \"I believe your education can begin\nforthwith. Are you ready?\"\n\n\n\n\n4: _In Which David and the Phoenix Go To Visit the Gryffins, and a\nGreat Danger Is Narrowly Averted_\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\nA chill raced up and down David's spine as he got to his feet.\n\n\"Do--do you think a week's practice is enough?\"\n\n\"Absolutely, my dear fellow. I am now in the very pink of condition.\nNot that I was ever out of condition, mind you. It was merely that\nI--ah--well, to be brief, my boy, I am now ready.\"\n\n\"Yes, but--well, you remember the last time.\"\n\n\"Yes. Look here--if it will make you feel better, suppose we have a\ntrial flight along the ledge.\"\n\n\"Well--all right.\"\n\nDavid got up as before on the Phoenix's back. The Phoenix spread its\nwings and hopped into the air. They glided easily down the length of\nthe ledge, clearing the thicket in the middle by a good two feet.\n\n\"There you are, my boy,\" said the bird proudly, as they landed at the\nother end. \"Shall we go?\"\n\n\"Let's go,\" said David, as bravely as he could.\n\nThey were in the air again. Once more he felt that rush of wind\nagainst his face and heard the pounding of wings. But this time there\nwas no giddy downward swoop. He breathed again and opened his eyes.\nThe world was falling away, and everything on it was growing smaller\nby the second. The valley could be cradled in two hands; the mountains\non either side looked like wrinkles in gray cloth. Now he could see\nplains in the distance, and little silver threads of rivers. As he\nlooked, the whole world began to revolve slowly. The Phoenix was\nsoaring in a wide circle.\n\n\"Well, my boy,\" it called over its shoulder, \"whom shall we visit\nfirst?\"\n\n\"It's really up to you, Phoenix,\" David shouted back, \"but how about\nthe--the--Biffens or Whiffens, or whatever you called them?\"\n\n\"You mean the Gryffins, Gryffons, and Gryffens, my boy? Very well. We\nshall visit the Gryffins only, however. It is best to leave the others\nalone.\"\n\nThe Phoenix swung around and began to fly toward the morning sun with\nsuch tremendous speed that David had to crouch down to avoid being\nblown off. The wind screamed past his ears, tore at his shirt and\nhair, and made his eyes brim over with tears. It was cold, but he was\ntoo excited to care. Below them, plains, rivers, forests, and cities\nrushed across the face of the earth.\n\n\"This is wonderful, Phoenix!\" David shouted.\n\nThe Phoenix's reply was not clear. \"... normal speed ... air stream ...\nprime days of my youth ...\" were the only words David caught, but he could\ntell from the tone that the Phoenix was pleased.\n\nThe view below was not to last long. Within half an hour they had run\ninto a heavy overcast, and for a long time it was like flying through\nvery wet, cold cotton. David glanced down, hoping to see the fog thin\nout. Suddenly he caught sight of a black object rocketing up toward\nthem. Before he could call out a warning, the thing hurtled by, so\nclose that its backwash very nearly knocked him from the bird's back.\nThe Phoenix reduced speed; and the black object, after banking in a\nwide curve, came cruising up alongside. David was amazed to see that\nit was a pale but beautiful lady, dressed all in black, sitting on a\nbroom.\n\n\"Hello, Phoenix!\" she cried in a teasing voice. \"I haven't seen you in\n_ever_ so long.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Good morning, I am sure,\" the Phoenix replied stiffly, staring\nstraight ahead.\n\n\"Phoenix,\" the lady continued coaxingly, \"I'm awfully bored. Won't you\nrace me? Please?\"\n\n\"Idle hands find mischief to do,\" said the Phoenix severely. \"_We_ are\nmaking good use of our time, and I suggest that _you_ do the same.\"\n\n\"Don't be so stuffy, Phoenix.\" She pouted. \"Come and race with me.\nI've got a new broom, and I want to see how good it is. Please!\"\n\n\"No,\" said the Phoenix sharply.\n\n\"Oh, all right for _you_!\" she said, tossing her head. \"You just don't\ndare, because you know I'll beat your tail feathers off!\" And she shot\nback into the mist below.\n\n\"Indeed!\" the Phoenix snorted. \"Beat my tail feathers off! Ha!\"\n\n\"Is she a Witch?\" David asked.\n\n\"Yes, my boy, and a shocking example of the decline of the younger\ngeneration. She will come to no good end, believe me. Tail feathers,\nindeed!\"\n\nJust then they burst out of the clouds and into the hot sunlight.\nBelow them, the land was wild and desolate, a vast rolling plain\ncovered for the most part with dry, tawny grass. Here and there were\ngroves of trees drooping beneath the sun. The Phoenix, still snorting\nindignantly to itself, dropped to within a hundred feet of the ground.\nThey began to soar back and forth.\n\n\"Can you see anything, my boy?\"\n\nDavid had never seen a Gryffin, of course; so he was not sure what to\nlook for. But he caught sight of something lying in the shade of a\nbush and pointed it out to the Phoenix.\n\n\"Ah, quite so,\" the Phoenix said doubtfully. \"It does not look like\na--but we can take a closer look.\"\n\nThey landed and walked toward the bush. In its shadow sprawled a very\nuntidy animal. Its tail and hindquarters were exactly like those of a\npanther, its chest and forelegs were like a hawk's, and it had pointed\nwings. Burrs matted its dusty fur. Its claws were shabby and split,\nand numerous black flies were crawling over its haunches. The bush\ntrembled with its snoring.\n\n\"Bah! We are wasting our time here, my boy. This is a Gryffen. A\ndisgusting brute, isn't it?\" And the Phoenix sniffed disapprovingly.\n\n\"Maybe if we wake it up,\" David suggested, \"it could tell us where the\nother ones live.\"\n\n\"Next to impossible. For one thing, a cannon could not awaken the\nbeast. For another thing, it would not, even if awake, be able to tell\nus anything. You simply cannot imagine the stupidity of these brutes.\"\n\n\"Well, let's _try_ it, anyway,\" David said.\n\n\"Very well, my boy. But it will be a complete waste of time.\" The\nPhoenix shrugged its shoulders, stepped up to the Gryffen, and kicked\nit violently.\n\n\"Phoenix!\" David cried in alarm. \"Don't hurt it!\"\n\n\"No fear,\" said the Phoenix, delivering another lusty kick. \"One\nsimply cannot damage a sleeping Gryffen. Give me a hand, my boy.\"\n\nDavid took hold of the Gryffen's wing, and the Phoenix seized its\ntail. For the next ten minutes they kicked and pulled and pounded,\nshouting \"HEY!\" and \"WAKE UP!\" at the top of their lungs. It was hot\nwork, and David finally admitted to himself that the Phoenix had been\nright. But before he could say so, the Phoenix completely lost its\ntemper and savagely bit the Gryffen's tail.\n\nThat did it. The Gryffen opened one eye halfway and said, \"Unffniph?\"\n\n\"GET UP!!\" the Phoenix bellowed.\n\nThe Gryffen struggled into a sitting position and yawned a tremendous\nand noisy yawn. Then it squinted blearily at David and murmured,\n\"What day is it?\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Wednesday,\" David said. \"Could you please tell us--\"\n\n\"Oh, Wednesday,\" said the Gryffen. It thought about this for a while,\nmumbling \"Wednesday ... Wednesday ...\" to itself. It lifted one leg as\nif to scratch the fly bites, changed its mind in mid-gesture, and\ndropped the leg again. \"Oh, _Wednesday_,\" it said at last. \"So it\nisn't Saturday?\"\n\n\"No,\" said David. \"What we want to know is--\"\n\n\"Not Saturday,\" said the Gryffen, sinking down to the ground with a\nhuge sigh of relief. \"Ah! Come back on Saturday. Saturday afternoon. I\ngenerally get up on Saturday ... in the ... afternoon....\" The words\nfaded into a snore.\n\n\"There you are, my dear fellow,\" said the Phoenix. \"Just as I said.\nOaf! Boor!\"\n\n\"A _very_ annoying animal,\" said David angrily.\n\n\"I agree, my boy. But the Gryffins are different, I assure you. Now,\nlet me see. Where should we look--\"\n\n\"There they come!\" David cried suddenly. \"Look!\" And indeed, a number\nof winged creatures were loping down a hillside toward them.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" the Phoenix shouted. \"Those are the ones we do _not_\nwant to meet! On my back, _quick_!\"\n\n\"What are they?\" David gasped as he threw himself on the bird's back.\n\n\"Gryffons!\"\n\nThe Phoenix rushed along the ground a few feet and sprang into the\nair. But it was too late. The foremost Gryffons, with powerful strokes\nof their wings, shot up to meet them. The Phoenix swerved sharply.\nThey missed the snapping beak of the first Gryffon by half an inch and\ndodged the second--only to smash into a third. David was stunned by\nthe blow and the fall. When he regained consciousness, he found\nhimself in the tight grip of two Gryffons. The Phoenix was struggling\nfeebly with another, and still more were crowding around them,\nscreaming like hawks.\n\nThey looked like the sleeping Gryffen, but were as large as ponies.\nTheir eyes were yellow and unblinking, and their tails twitched like\nan angry cat's. Their smell, like the lion house in the zoo, made\nDavid feel faint.\n\n\"Well, Phoenix,\" said the largest Gryffon coldly, \"you know the Rule,\nI believe?\"\n\nThe Phoenix smiled weakly and cleared its throat. \"Ah, there,\nGryffon,\" it said unsteadily. \"Fancy meeting you here. Ah--ah--rule?\nWhat rule?\"\n\n\"Rule 26,\" said the Gryffon. \"'No human being shall be allowed to\nenter the--'\"\n\n\"Oh, that rule,\" said the Phoenix, with a careless laugh. \"I thought\neveryone knew that the Council of 1935 had changed it. Can it be that\nyou have not yet heard?\"\n\n\"That won't do, Phoenix. You have also heard, of course, of the\npenalty for breaking the Rule, which you must suffer along with this\nhuman boy?\"\n\n\"Now, one moment, my dear Gryffon! I--ah--\"\n\n\"Death!\"\n\nThe Phoenix quailed, and David's legs went limp under him. But they\nhad no chance to plead with the Gryffons. Their captors formed two\nlines, one on each side of them, and at a scream of command from the\nleader, all began to march. The Gryffon that had been holding the\nPhoenix winked horribly at David and made a throat-cutting gesture\nwith its wing.\n\n\"Courage, my boy,\" the Phoenix whispered. \"It is always darkest before\ndawn.\"\n\nPresently they reached a hillside. David and the Phoenix were marched\nup to a cave and thrown in. Two of the Gryffons sat down at the\nentrance to guard them while the others went off to consider the best\nmethod of carrying out the penalty.\n\nDavid was terribly frightened now, but he did not want to let the\nPhoenix know it. In a voice which trembled a little he asked, \"What\nare we going to do?\"\n\nThe Phoenix frowned. \"Do not be downcast, my boy. My brain is equal to\nany occasion. I shall Think. Silence, please.\"\n\nAnd the Phoenix, covering its eyes with one wing, Thought.\n\nTo keep himself occupied, David explored the cave. But there was\nnothing to see. The cave was small and bare. He tested the walls\nthoroughly to see if there were any places where they might dig their\nway out. There were none. His feet raised a cloud of fine dust, which\ngot into his eyes and nose and made him sneeze violently. Discouraged,\nhe went back to the Phoenix and sat down. There was a long silence.\n\nGradually an idea came to David. It started as a small, faint thought\nat the back of his mind, wavered, began to grow and expand and fill\nout--became bigger and clearer and better and--\n\n\"Phoenix!\" cried David, jumping to his feet.\n\n\"My boy, my very dear boy,\" said the Phoenix, its voice breaking with\nemotion, \"I have Thought, I have Pondered, I have--well, to be brief,\nit is no use. Stiff upper lip, my boy! We are Doomed.\"\n\n\"Phoenix, I--\"\n\n\"Let this be a lesson to you, my boy, even though it be your last one.\nFools rush in where angels fear to tread. Ah! who could have said, in\nthe golden days of my youth, that I should come to such an end! Oh,\nmiserable bird! Oh, unhappy boy!\"\n\n\"Phoenix--\"\n\n\"But we can show them how to die, my boy! We still have that--the last\nmagnificent gesture. Let those who have lived wisely and well show\nthat they can die in the same way! I hope I am to go first, so that\nyou may have an example to follow.\"\n\n\"_Phoenix!_\"\n\n\"My boy?\"\n\n\"Listen, please!\" And David whispered in the Phoenix's ear.\n\nThe plan had seemed like a good one while it was still in his mind,\nbut put into words it sounded a little too simple. As he whispered,\nDavid began to feel more and more foolish, so that finally he stopped\naltogether.\n\n\"I--I guess it's really kind of silly,\" he stammered.\n\nBut the Phoenix was looking at him with hope and admiration in its\neyes. \"My very dear chap,\" it said solemnly, \"I salute you. I humbly\nawait your signal.\"\n\n\"Do you really think it will work?\"\n\n\"My boy, it must--it can--it shall. Proceed.\"\n\nPoor as the plan now seemed to David, he prepared to carry it out.\nHolding his breath so as not to sneeze again, he scooped up as much\ndust as he could hold in two hands. Then he took his position on one\nside of the cave, nodded the Phoenix toward the other, and glanced out\nto see if the guardian Gryffons were looking. They were not.\n\n\"Now,\" he whispered.\n\nThe cave rocked with their uproar. David screamed at the top of his\nvoice and kicked the walls. The Phoenix let out a series of\near-splitting whistles and squawks and beat its wings frantically.\nEchoes bounced from wall to wall. The two Gryffons came rushing into\nthe cave, adding to the racket with their shrieking. \"Now!\" David\nshouted, and he flung the double handful of dust into the Gryffons'\nfaces. Instantly they were all choking and sneezing in the thick\ncloud. He plunged between the legs of the two Gryffons, who in the\nconfusion began to bite and tear savagely at each other.\n\nDavid and the Phoenix burst out of the cave together. The other\nGryffons, aroused by the noise, were bounding toward them. David flung\nhimself on the Phoenix's back and shouted \"Fly!\" and sneezed. From\nsomewhere behind him a set of talons snatched out and ripped through\nthe back of his shirt. He kicked blindly and felt his foot crunch into\nsomething which shrieked. \"Fly, Phoenix!\" he sobbed. The Phoenix was\nalready in the air and needed no encouragement. They heard raucous\ncries and the thunder of wings behind them. David looked back over his\nshoulder. The Gryffons were rising from the ground in pursuit, their\nlegs drawn up under them and their wings beating. \"Faster!\" he\nscreamed.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"You have seen nothing in the way of flying until now, my boy,\" the\nPhoenix shouted back. \"Watch this!\" Its wings were two blurs slicing\nthrough the air and roaring like kettledrums. The ground below\nstreamed backwards. David looked back again. The Gryffons were falling\ninto the distance. Their cries were getting fainter. Now they looked\nlike a flock of starlings ... now like a cluster of flies ... now\nlike gnats. And then they had faded out of sight, and David and the\nPhoenix were streaking over the grassland alone.\n\nTen minutes later they reached a shore and landed. They flopped on the\nsand, panting. And David, suddenly feeling very faint, closed his eyes\nand put his head between his knees. After they had got their breath,\nthe Phoenix patted David on the shoulder and said huskily:\n\n\"I congratulate you, my boy. Your plan was magnificent--precisely what\n_I_ should have done, had I thought of it first. Needless to say, we\nshall not go on looking for the Gryffins. But now you know exactly\nwhat they are like: midway in size between the Gryffens and Gryffons,\nand reddish in color. Most amiable souls, willing to do anything for\nanyone. It is hard to believe that they are all related. But enough,\nmy boy. Let us go home.\"\n\nAs soon as they reached the ledge, the Phoenix put David down and\nprepared to take off again.\n\n\"Where are you going, Phoenix?\" David asked.\n\n\"Some business to attend to, my boy.\"\n\nMuttering under its breath something that sounded like \"tail feathers,\nindeed!\" the Phoenix soared off. And David, stiff and sore and\nthoroughly tired, started down the mountainside for home.\n\n\n\n\n5: _In Which the Scientist Arrives in Pursuit of the Phoenix, and\nThere Are Alarums and Excursions by Night_\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\nThe lights downstairs were all on when David got home, and as soon as\nhe opened the front door he could tell that they had company.\n\nHe shouted, \"I'm home!\" and sneezed. The dust from the Gryffons' cave\nstill clung to him, tickling his nose.\n\n\"Well, here he is at last,\" said Dad's voice. \"Come on in, David.\"\nThen, as David walked into the living room, \"Good heavens, Son, what's\nhappened to you?\"\n\n\"Your _back_, David!\" Mother said in a horrified voice. \"Your poor\nback! What _happened_ to you?\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nDavid felt himself. The back of his shirt was ripped to tatters, and\nthere were three lines of caked blood across his shoulders. He\nremembered now: it was the Gryffon that had tried to grab him as he\nand the Phoenix made their escape. But he had promised the Phoenix to\nkeep its secret.\n\nHe stammered, \"I--I had an accident.\"\n\n\"And dust all _over_ you!\" Mother went on.\n\n\"Well,\" said David desperately, \"it was a _dusty_ accident.\"\n\n\"It seems to have been very dusty indeed,\" said a third voice. There\nwas a loud sneeze.\n\nDavid's father jumped up. \"You gave me such a shock when you came in\nthat I almost forgot, David. We have a guest.\" And he introduced David\nto a very tall, thin man with a bald head. His face and neck were\nburnt red by the sun, and he had on a pair of thick glasses which made\nhis pale eyes look immense. For some reason David took an instant\ndislike to him, but he shook hands politely and said, \"How do you do?\"\n\n\"David, eh?\" said the man. \"Well, well. Are you a good boy, David?\"\n\nOf all the stupid questions in the world, that was the one David hated\nmost. He clenched his teeth and looked the other way.\n\n\"David, dear,\" said Mother with an awkward laugh, \"I think you'd\nbetter go upstairs and wash and change.\"\n\nWhen David came into the living room again, the guest was talking\nexcitedly. \"... completely unknown to man,\" he was saying. \"It's the\ndiscovery of the age. My name will be famous if I succeed in my\nplans.\"\n\n\"How fascinating!\" Mother said. \"And to think of it happening right\nhere!\"\n\n\"And it's huge,\" the guest said, \"simply huge. And brilliantly\ncolored. For a scientist like myself, it's more than fascinating.\"\n\nDavid was listening now. Scientist? _Scientist!_ His heart missed a\nbeat, and he choked. Oh, no, it couldn't be _the_ Scientist. _Or could\nit?_\n\n\"David here spends all his time up on the mountain,\" his father said.\n\"Maybe he's seen it.\"\n\nThe guest turned his big, pale, unpleasant eyes on David. \"Well,\nDavid,\" he said, \"maybe you can help me. Now, have you seen anything\nunusual on the mountain?\"\n\n\"Unusual?\" said David unsteadily. There was a pain in his chest from\nthe pounding of his heart.\n\n\"Yes, David,\" the guest went on, \"unusual. So unusual that you\ncouldn't miss it: a very large bird with bright plumage.\"\n\nThe floor under David seemed to rock. It was true, then--it was\nhorribly true. This was the Scientist who had been chasing the\nPhoenix. This was their enemy.\n\n\"Bird?\" David dodged. \"Wh-wh-why, there are lots of birds up there.\nSparrows and meadow larks and--and sparrows....\"\n\n\"But nothing like a huge bird with bright feathers?\"\n\nWell, he would have to tell a lie. After all, it was for the Phoenix's\nsake.\n\n\"No,\" said David.\n\n\"Ah,\" said the Scientist. But his cold eyes bored into David's for\nanother instant, plainly saying, \"I'm not fooled, young man.\"\n\n\"It's odd,\" he continued, \"that no one has seen it. But I have no\ndoubt it's somewhere here. I am going to begin my search as soon as my\nequipment gets here.\"\n\n\"Tell us about it,\" said Mother politely.\n\n\"Well, I discovered it on the other side of the valley, you know,\"\nsaid the Scientist eagerly. \"Quite by accident--I was really looking\nfor another species. Now, birds, you know, have fixed habits. If you\nknow those habits, you can predict just what they will do at any time.\nThis particular bird was a daytime creature, so I tried to watch it\nbetween dawn and dusk. But it seemed to have a mind of its own--you\nmight almost say an intelligence. It avoided me in a very clever way,\nand it avoided my traps also. Uncanny! So after several weeks I\ndecided to shoot it if I got the chance. Then suddenly it disappeared,\nbut I'm certain it came over to this side of the valley--\"\n\nThere was no escape from the subject during dinner. The Scientist\ncould think and talk of nothing else. He described the merits of\ndeadfalls, snares, steel traps, and birdlime. He asked which they\nthought would make the best bait, a rabbit, a beefsteak, a live lamb,\nor carrion. He told them all about the new high-powered, long-range\nrifle which he had ordered. And he vowed to them all that he would not\nrest until the bird was either caught or killed \"for the advancement\nof human learning.\"\n\nDavid listened with horror. The dinner before him went untouched. His\nonly thought was that now he would have to warn the Phoenix as soon as\npossible. The Phoenix would go to South America after all, and his\neducation would end before it had even started. All because of this\nhateful man! He fought to hold back his tears.\n\nDinner was over at last. David mumbled his excuses and ducked out of\nthe dining room, but Aunt Amy seized him firmly just as he thought he\nhad got away.\n\n\"Bedtime for you, David,\" she said firmly.\n\n\"Oh, Aunt Amy, please! I've got to--\"\n\n\"Upstairs, young man. You've had enough gallivanting around for one\nday. You're all worn out.\"\n\n\"I'm _not_!\" said David, struggling. \"I feel fine. Look, I just _have_\nto--\"\n\nIt was useless. She marched him upstairs to his room and stood in the\ndoorway until he had undressed and put on his pajamas and got into\nbed.\n\n\"Now,\" she said, \"you go to sleep. The mountain will still be there in\nthe morning--unless there's a landslide. Good night.\" And she turned\nout the light and shut the door.\n\nThis was awful! He could not sneak downstairs, because the stairs\ncould be seen from the living room. He could not climb out of his\nwindow, because a rose arbor was directly beneath it, and he would be\nripped by the thorns. And Mother always came in to say good night\nbefore she went to bed. If he was not there when she came in tonight,\nthere would be a lot of unpleasant explaining to do. The only thing,\nthen, was to wait until the Scientist went home and everyone was in\nbed.\n\nIt was a maddening wait. The Scientist's voice went on and on like the\ndrone of an electric fan, interrupted only by an occasional murmur\nfrom Mother or Dad. For a while David sat in bed twisting the sheets\nin his hands; then he got up and paced the room in his bare feet. It\nseemed to him that three or four whole nighttimes had passed before he\nfinally heard all three voices raised and talking at once.\n\nThe Scientist was going! Now they were saying good-by at the front\ndoor ... now the door was being closed ... now there were footsteps on\nthe stairs. He jumped into bed just before Mother put her head in and\nsaid, \"Good night, dear.\" David murmured, pretending to be half\nasleep. His door closed again. The light switches snapped, and there\nwas silence.\n\nHe waited another half hour to make sure everyone was asleep. As\nquickly and silently as he could, he pulled on his clothes, crept out\nof his room, and slid cautiously down the bannister. In the back yard\nhe put on his shoes, dived through the hedge, and started to race up\nthe mountainside.\n\nFortunately there was a nearly-full moon and no clouds in the sky. But\neven with this light, it was not easy to keep to the trail. Several\ntimes he lost his way, so that the trip took much longer than usual.\nBut he found the ledge at last, climbed over the final difficult rock,\nand sat down to catch his breath. When he could speak, he called\nsoftly:\n\n\"Phoenix!\"\n\nThere was no answer.\n\n\"Phoenix!\" He pushed through the thicket to the other side of the\nledge. \"_Phoenix!_\"\n\nThe Phoenix was gone.\n\nThe tears that had been stopped up all evening could be held no\nlonger. David dropped to the ground, leaned his forehead against a\nrock, and let them go. He had just remembered. As soon as they had\ncome back from the Gryffon adventure, the Phoenix had flown off on\nsome sort of business. And it had not said when it would return.\n\nThe tears cleared David's mind and made him feel better. Now what? He\nbegan to think. If he stayed on the ledge all night, they might find\nout at home and make a terrible fuss. But if he did not warn the\nPhoenix before morning, the Scientist might creep up while the bird\nwas resting and trap it or shoot it. So he would have to warn the\nPhoenix _and_ return home. And the only way to do both these things\nwas to write the Phoenix a note.\n\nBut he had neither paper nor pencil.\n\nA fine mess he had made of everything! Now he would have to go all the\nway back home, write the note, come all the way back up to the ledge,\nand then go home again.\n\nDavid trudged down the mountainside in a very low mood. Now that he\nhad a definite plan to work on, his fear was gone, but he felt that he\nhad been pretty stupid to rush off without thinking of everything\nfirst. In his mind he could hear the Phoenix saying, \"Look before you\nleap, my boy,\" and other wise words of advice. And he had cried, too.\nLucky that no one had been there to see _that_.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs he approached the house he was surprised to see all the lights\nablaze and to hear his name being called. \"Oh-oh,\" he thought,\n\"they've found out I've gone.\"\n\n\"Here I am!\" he shouted, opening the door. \"What's the matter?\"\n\nIt was a strange sight which met him inside. Dad, in his gray pajamas,\nwas waving a revolver and making fierce noises. Mother, looking\nfrightened, had a shoe in one hand. Aunt Amy, with her hair in rags,\nwas also well-armed--with a big cast-iron frying pan. Beckie was\nhowling upstairs.\n\n\"David!\" Mother cried. \"Are you all right? Where have you been? Did he\nhurt you?\"\n\n\"Who?\" said David. \"I'm all right. What's the matter?\"\n\n\"The burglar!\" said Mother excitedly. \"He put his head in the window\nand said '_pssssst!_'\"\n\n\"I tell you, burglars don't say _pssssst_!\" Dad said. \"They try to\nmake as little noise as possible. Just let me catch him doing it\nagain!\" he added, waving his pistol.\n\n\"Running around on that mountain at all hours of the night,\" Aunt Amy\ngrumbled, \"with burglars and I don't know what-all loose in town!\"\n\n\"And then we found that you were gone, and we thought he had stolen\nyou,\" Mother went on. \"Where have you been?\"\n\n\"I couldn't sleep,\" said David. \"So I went for a walk.\"\n\n\"Well, thank heavens you're safe,\" said Mother.\n\n\"Hankering after that mountain all night,\" Aunt Amy muttered. \"As if\nhe wasn't up there all day.\"\n\n\"Look here, Son,\" said Dad. \"What do you know about this?\"\n\n\"Honestly, Dad,\" said David, \"I couldn't sleep. There's nothing wrong\nwith that. I can't help it if I can't sleep. So I took a walk. There's\nnothing wrong with--\"\n\n\"Oh, all right, all right,\" his father said. \"I suppose it's just a\ncoincidence. Let's all get back to sleep. And, David, the next time\nyou can't sleep, try counting sheep.\"\n\nGradually the house calmed down. Beckie stopped wailing, Dad put away\nhis gun, good nights were said, the lights were turned off.\n\nDavid knew that it would be at least an hour before he dared to move\nagain, and he would have to be doubly careful this time. And he was a\nlittle nervous himself now about that burglar. What if he should meet\nhim when he went out again? He tried to forget about that by thinking\nof what he would put in the note for the Phoenix.\n\nHe had got as far as \"Dear Phoenix:\" and was wondering how you spelled\n\"Phoenix,\" when there came a swish and a thump at his window, followed\nby a cautious whisper:\n\n\"_Pssssst!_\"\n\nDavid felt his scalp prickle. \"Wh-wh-who's that?\" he quavered.\n\n\"Is that you, my boy?\" whispered a familiar, guarded voice. \"Ah, thank\nheavens!\"\n\nAnd the Phoenix crawled through the window.\n\nWeak with relief, David snapped on the bedside light. The Phoenix\npresented a shocking sight. Its face was drawn with fatigue, and it\nlooked rather draggled. Its back sagged, its wings drooped to the\nfloor, and it walked with a limp.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Oh, Phoenix, Phoenix!\" David whispered. He jumped to support the bird\nbefore it collapsed entirely.\n\n\"Ah, thank you, my boy,\" the Phoenix murmured. \"Your bed, I presume?\nMay I? Thank you.\" The springs creaked under its weight as the Phoenix\ngingerly lay down.\n\n\"What a night, my boy, _what_ a night!\" it sighed weakly, closing its\neyes.\n\n\"Oh, Phoenix, what happened? Can I do anything for you?\" David\nwhispered.\n\n\"A damp, cooling cloth upon my forehead would be welcome, my boy,\"\nmurmured the Phoenix. \"Also a bit of nourishment.\"\n\nDavid slid down the bannister, got a handful of cookies and a glass of\nmilk, and dampened a dish towel. When he returned, the Phoenix was\nfast asleep.\n\n\"Phoenix,\" he whispered, \"wake up. Here's your--\"\n\nThe Phoenix awoke with a violent start and stared wildly around the\nroom. \"Trapped!\" it muttered, making a frenzied effort to get off the\nbed.\n\n\"Not so _loud_!\" David whispered sharply. \"It's me!\"\n\nUnderstanding dawned in the Phoenix's eyes, and it eased itself back\nwith a sigh. \"Ah, you, my boy. You gave me quite a fright. I\nthought--\" But here the Phoenix caught sight of the milk and cookies\nand sat up again.\n\n\"Ambrosia,\" it sighed reverently. \"And nectar. You _are_ a prince, my\ndear fellow!\" And the Phoenix reached out eagerly.\n\n\"Now, Phoenix,\" David whispered as he wrapped the wet towel around the\nPhoenix's head, \"what's happened?\"\n\n\"Ah, that feels heavenly, my boy! (Munch munch.) What has happened?\n(Munch munch. Gulp.) I was insulted, I accepted a challenge, and I\nbrilliantly maintained my honor. Let that be a lesson to you, my boy:\ndeath before dishonor. Yes, in spite of my age, I--\"\n\n\"But Phoenix, what _happened_?\"\n\n\"To be brief, then, my boy, for brevity is the soul of wit--although I am\nnot trying to be witty now; I am simply too worn out--Brevity--ah--where\nwas I?\"\n\n\"I _think_ you were telling me what happened to you tonight,\" David\nsaid.\n\n\"Ah, yes, quite so! Well, I raced the Witch, to put it quite simply.\"\n\n\"Oh, Phoenix! Did you win?\"\n\n\"She said that she would 'beat my tail feathers off,' did she not?\nBehold, my dear fellow--every tail feather intact!\"\n\n\"Good for you, Phoenix! How did it go?\"\n\n\"I found her somewhere over Scotland and accepted her challenge. We\njockeyed about for starting positions, and she insulted me by offering\nme a handicap--which, of course, I refused. For several hundred miles\nit was nip and tuck, as it were. Then, over Luxembourg, I put all my\nenergies into a magnificent sprint and won the race by three and a\nhalf broom lengths. She claimed a foul and went off in a fit of sulks,\nof course. (I never saw a Witch who was a good loser.) And I--well,\nthe fact is, my boy, that I am not as young as I used to be. I simply\n_crawled_ home.\"\n\n\"Oh, you poor Phoenix! But you won, though. Good for you, Phoenix.\nI'm proud of you! I didn't like her at all.\"\n\n\"There you are--I had to win, for both of us. Now, as I wended my\nweary way homeward, I realized that I should be too tired to go\ntraveling tomorrow. So I decided to tell you, in case you should want\nto do something else during the day. But I did not know which house\nwas yours. I had to pick one at random. I thrust my head in a window\nand uttered a cautious _pssssst_! Imagine my dismay when I was\nanswered by a piercing scream! I had to beat a hasty and undignified\nretreat into a garage until all was peaceful again. Then I did the\nsame thing at the next house, and the next, with the same results.\"\nThe Phoenix sighed. \"Would you believe it, my boy?--this is the fifth\nhouse I tried. But I knew I was on the right track when I heard them\ncalling for you.\"\n\n\"Oh, so it was _you_,\" said David. \"You almost frightened Mother to\ndeath. She thought you were a burglar.\"\n\n\"My dear fellow, I am really sorry for having caused any\nmisunderstanding or fright,\" said the Phoenix apologetically. \"It was\njust that I wanted to tell you of my victory--that is, to tell you\nthat I should be indisposed tomorrow.\"\n\nThen David recalled that he had something to say too. The shock of\nremembering was such that he blurted out the news without thinking of\nsoftening the blow.\n\n\"Phoenix, listen! The Scientist is here!\"\n\nThe Phoenix sat up in bed with a jerk, and David barely suppressed its\nstartled exclamation by clamping a hand over its beak.\n\n\"It's not so bad yet,\" he whispered hurriedly, \"because he's not sure\nwhere you are, and he has to wait for his equipment to get here. But,\noh, Phoenix, now I suppose you'll go to South America after all, and I\nwon't have any more education.\"\n\nThe Phoenix leaped to its feet and struck a defiant pose. \"My boy,\" it\nsaid angrily, \"you are mistaken. I refuse to be chased around any\nlonger. Even the lowly worm turns. Am I a mouse, or am I the Phoenix?\nIf that insufferable man wishes to pursue me further, if he cannot\nmind his own business, then, by Jove, we shall meet him face to face\nand FIGHT TO THE FINISH!\"\n\nIts voice, which had been getting louder and louder, ended in an\nindignant squawk (its battle cry, as it explained later). David's\nwarning _ssh!_ was too late. They heard rapid footsteps and the sound\nof light switches snapping.\n\n\"Quick!\" David said. \"Out the window!\"\n\nWith a hasty \"Farewell, my boy,\" the Phoenix plunged headlong toward\nthe window--and tripped over the sill. There was a resounding crash\noutside as the bird landed on the rose arbor, a brief but furious\nthrashing and muttering, and then the receding flurry of wings.\n\nDad burst into the room with his revolver, followed by Mother and Aunt\nAmy (with two frying pans, this time).\n\n\"He stuck his head in the window and said _pssssst!_ at me!\" David\ncried. \"A big dark shape in the window!\"\n\nThis time Dad telephoned the police. In no time at all, three carloads\nof weary policemen were swarming over the house and yard, with guns\nand flashlights drawn. It was the fifth--or was it the sixth?--call\nthey had received from the neighborhood that night, they explained.\nThere followed an hour of questions, arguments, and theories, during\nwhich everyone became very excited. Everyone, that is, except\nDavid--although he acted excited to avoid suspicion. But he was happy.\nHe had warned the Phoenix, the Phoenix was going to stay, and there\nwas nothing to worry about until tomorrow.\n\n\n\n\n6: _In Which the Phoenix Has a Plan, and David and the Phoenix Call On\na Sea Monster_\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\"Well, you're in all the papers this morning, Phoenix,\" said David, as\nhe sat down beside the reclining bird next morning. \"They don't know\nwho you are, but they're all talking about what happened last night.\nThey call you the 'Whispering Burglar.' The police are pretty\nworried.\"\n\n\"My dear chap,\" said the Phoenix apologetically, \"let me repeat my\nsincere regrets for causing alarm. It was not my desire to--the\n_police_, did you say? Have they discovered any clues?\"\n\n\"No,\" said David reassuringly. \"They can't find a thing. They think\nthe Whispering Burglar climbed up a ladder to say _pssssst!_ into the\nupstairs windows. Only they can't find the ladder. They call it the\n'Missing Mystery Clue.'\"\n\nThe Phoenix gazed at the sky and mused. \"In all the papers, you say?\nWell, Fame at last--although hardly the kind I had expected. What a\npity that there can be no photographs with the story. Imagine a\npicture of me on the front page! A profile, perhaps--or would a\nfull-length shot be more effective? Or both, let us say, with--\"\n\n\"I know you'd look very handsome, Phoenix,\" David interrupted, \"but\nwhat we _should_ be thinking about is the Scientist. What are we going\nto do?\"\n\n\"Oh, _that_,\" said the Phoenix. \"I was coming to that, my boy. The\nbattle is already half won. I have a Plan.\"\n\n\"Good for you, Phoenix! What is it?\"\n\n\"Aha!\" said the Phoenix, with a mysterious smile. \"All will unfold in\ntime. Rest assured that the Plan is brilliant. In one stroke of genius\nit solves everything. Tactics, my boy! Napoleon had nothing on me.\"\n\n\"But what _is_ it, Phoenix?\"\n\n\"Tut, my boy,\" said the Phoenix in a maddening way. \"Control your\nimpatience. You will see. Now, we shall have to buy some things, so we\nshall need money. Let me see.... Several of the Leprechauns have large\npots of gold.... No, I fear they would not part with so much as a\npenny. Tightfisted, my dear fellow!--you never saw such misers.\nHmmm.... Well, there are the Dragons, of course; they guard heaps of\ntreasure in caves. But no--they are excellent chaps in most respects,\nbut frightfully stuffy about loans and gifts. No.... The Djinn? No,\nhis money is all tied up in Arabian oil speculation. Aha! Why didn't I\nthink of that before? The Sea Monster, of course!\"\n\n\"Do Sea Monsters have money?\" asked David.\n\n\"No, but the Sea Monster should know where pirate treasure is\nburied--quite in its nautical line. We shall visit the Monster, my\nboy. Tomorrow, of course--I could not fly a foot today to save my\nlife. My muscles are killing me!\"\n\n\"Oh, poor Phoenix!\" David said. But he was so excited that he could\nnot feel much pity. Pirate treasure! They were going to dig for pirate\ntreasure!\n\n\"We shall need a spade. I trust you will arrange for it, my boy?\"\n\n\"Of course, Phoenix,\" said David, jumping to his feet. \"I'll get\neverything ready right away. Don't move till I get back.\"\n\n\"Impossible, my boy.\" The Phoenix groaned as it shifted into a more\ncomfortable position.\n\nDavid raced home to collect the necessary things for the trip.\nRemembering how cold it had been last time, he took his leather jacket\nout of the closet, and a pair of gloves and a scarf. For the Phoenix\nhe borrowed a bottle of liniment and took all the cookies from the\ncooky jar. And he picked the shortest of three spades in the garage.\nDuring the rest of the day he massaged the Phoenix's back and wings\nwith the liniment. He was exploding with curiosity about the Plan, of\ncourse. But the Phoenix would only smile its smuggest smile and tell\nhim to \"wait and see, wait and see\"--which almost drove David mad.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTomorrow took its time, the way it always does when you are anxious to\nsee it arrive, but it finally came. And David found himself with the\nspade held tightly under one arm, his jacket zipped up to his chin,\ngloves on, and scarf knotted, all ready to go.\n\n\"To the west, this time,\" said the Phoenix, as David got up on its\nback. \"This is the Monster's Pacific season, you know. Ready, my boy?\nSplendid! We are off!\"\n\nOver the mountains and desert they sped, over the shore, out across\nthe ocean. For a long time they hurtled through a huge blue\nloneliness, dark blue below, lighter blue above. Once they passed over\na ship, a pencil dot trailing a pin-scratch of white. Another time\nthey startled a high-flying albatross, which gave a frightened squawk\nand plunged down out of sight with folded wings. Aside from that,\nthere was nothing to see until they reached the islands.\n\nThe Phoenix slowed down to a glide and dropped lower. \"These are the\ncoral atolls of the Pacific, my boy,\" it called over its shoulder.\n\"That lake in the center of each island is called the lagoon.\"\n\nDavid was enchanted by the atolls. They were made of tiny islets,\nstrung together like the beads of a necklace. And the colors! The dark\nblue of the sea became lighter around the islands, melting from\nsapphire to turquoise to jade. The atolls were ringed with dazzling\nwhite surf and beach, and they all had cool green swaths of palm trees\nand underbrush. And each lagoon also had its varying shades of blue,\nlike the outer sea.\n\n\"I fear we may have trouble, my boy,\" said the Phoenix, as they\nscanned the empty beaches. \"The Monster shifts about from island to\nisland to avoid discovery. We shall just have to search.\"\n\nAnd search they did, atoll after atoll, until at the end of an hour\nthey were rewarded. David suddenly spotted a dark object stretched out\non the beach of a lagoon, and at the same time the Phoenix said \"Aha!\"\ntriumphantly. They began to spiral down.\n\nThe Sea Monster was immense. Its body could have filled the living\nroom at home. Its neck was twenty feet long, and so was its tail\n(which ended in a barbed point). It had huge seal-like flippers, and\nits polished brown hide was made up of scales as big as dinner plates.\n\n\"Wake up, Monster!\" The Phoenix cried. \"We--\"\n\nThe next instant they were lost in a cloud of flying sand and spray,\nthrough which could be heard a prodigious splash. When it had cleared,\nthey found themselves alone on the beach. The only sign of the Sea\nMonster was a great furrow in the sand, which led down to the agitated\nwater.\n\n\"Golly, that was fast!\" David marveled, as they shook the sand from\nthemselves. \"Do you think it'll come back, Phoenix?\"\n\n\"Of course, my boy. Curiosity, if nothing else, will bring it up\nagain. In the meantime, we might as well sit down and wait.\"\n\nThey sat down and waited. David took off his jacket. For fifteen\nminutes they heard nothing but the murmuring of the surf and the\nrustling clatter of palm fronds. At last there was a slight splashing\nnoise from the lagoon.\n\n\"There,\" David whispered, pointing.\n\nThirty feet offshore, an ear was being thrust cautiously above the\nrippled surface. It twitched once or twice, then pointed quiveringly\nin their direction.\n\n\"Come out, Monster!\" the Phoenix shouted. \"It is I, the Phoenix.\"\n\nThe Sea Monster's head appeared slowly, followed by several yards of\nneck. It peered at them short-sightedly, weaving its head from side to\nside to get a better view. David saw that it had two short, straight\nhorns just in front of its ears, eyes that were soft and cowlike, and\na most expressive set of whiskers. The whiskers were now at a\ndoubtful, half-mast angle.\n\n\"Ah, Phoenix,\" said the Sea Monster at last in a mild voice. \"Can't\nyou remember to wake me a bit more gently? I thought you were--\"\n\n\"Come on out,\" said the Phoenix firmly, \"and stop looking like a lost\nsheep.\"\n\n\"Uh--what about--uh--that?\" said the Sea Monster hesitantly, pointing\none ear at David.\n\n\"This,\" said the Phoenix, \"is David. He is getting an education. I\nassure you that he will not bite.\"\n\nThe Sea Monster swam toward them, heaved itself out of the water, and\noffered its huge flipper for David to shake.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Sorry I rushed off like that,\" it said. \"The trouble is, I've had\nsuch a bad case of war nerves. Why, sometimes I jump out of my skin at\nnothing at all.\"\n\n\"Were you in the war?\" David asked.\n\n\"Ah, _was_ I,\" sighed the Sea Monster. It flopped down comfortably on\nits belly, curled its tail around its front flippers, and sighed\nagain. But David noticed that its whiskers had perked up to a quite\ncheerful angle. The Sea Monster was obviously delighted to have\nsomeone listen to its troubles.\n\n\"Yes,\" it said, heaving a third sigh, \"I was. From the very beginning,\nmuch against my will. Guns all over the place! Terrible!\"\n\n\"Did they shoot you?\" David asked, horrified.\n\n\"Well, _at_ me, anyway. I'm thankful to say they never hit me, but\nthere were some pretty near misses. All the oceans were simply packed\nwith ships. I couldn't lift my head out of water without bringing down\na perfect rain of shells and bullets.\"\n\n\"The _intelligent_ thing in that case,\" the Phoenix broke in with a\nsniff, \"would have been to stay _under_ water.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Phoenix,\" said the Sea Monster dryly. \"But I _do_ like to\nbreathe now and then. Anyway, I wasn't safe even under water. They'd\ndrop depth charges on me. One ship even launched a torpedo at me!\"\n\n\"How awful!\" said David.\n\n\"Tut! my boy,\" said the Phoenix. \"I have no doubt our friend is\nstretching the truth shamelessly. You need not look so smug, Monster.\nYou were not the only one in the war. _I_ have gone through\nanti-aircraft fire a number of times. Some of it was very severe. In\nfact, once I--\"\n\n\"Once I had the whole North Atlantic fleet after _me_,\" the Sea\nMonster interrupted proudly.\n\n\"And _I_ remember the Franco-Prussian War!\" said the Phoenix. \"Which,\nI daresay, you do _not_.\"\n\n\"Well--uh--no, I don't.\"\n\n\"There you are!\" the Phoenix crowed.\n\nThe Sea Monster, looking rather ruffled, pointedly turned from the\nPhoenix and said to David, \"What should you like to do, David?\"\n\nDavid suddenly remembered what they had come for, and the excitement\nrushed back into his heart. He opened his mouth to cry \"We want to dig\nfor treasure!\" and then stopped short. Asking for money, he knew, was\nan impolite thing to do--especially from someone you had only just\nmet. And there was no telling how the Sea Monster might feel about\npeople nosing around for its treasure. So he looked at the Phoenix and\nwaited for it to speak.\n\nThe Phoenix caught David's glance, cleared its throat several times,\nand looked apologetically at the Sea Monster. \"Monster, old chap,\" it\nsaid soothingly, \"I am deeply sorry for having doubted you just now.\nDeeply sorry.\"\n\n\"Quite all right,\" said the Sea Monster stiffly.\n\n\"Yes,\" the Phoenix continued, \"we both know that you have passed\nthrough perilous times, through dangers which (I must confess) would\nhave left _me_ a shattered wreck.\"\n\nThe Sea Monster sighed sadly, but its whiskers were beginning to rise\nagain.\n\n\"The Monster bears up very well under this fearful strain--don't you\nthink so, my boy? A splendid example for the rest of us. Magnificent.\"\n\nThe Sea Monster's whiskers were quivering with pleasure.\n\n\"Monster, old chap, old friend, you were never one to let a boon\ncompanion down. If I have said it once, I have said it a hundred\ntimes: 'The Sea Monster,' I have said, 'the Sea Monster is the helpful\nsort. Mention the words Staunch Friend,' I have said, 'and\nimmediately the Sea Monster comes to mind.'\"\n\nThe Phoenix reached up one wing and began to pat the Sea Monster's\nflipper.\n\n\"Monster, old chum, we--ah--we--Well, the plain fact is that\nwe--ah--we have need of--such a trifling matter\" (here the Phoenix\ngave a careless laugh) \"that I should not really bring it up at all.\nAh--we need a bit of money.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said the Sea Monster. Its whiskers sagged.\n\n\"Now, please do not be offended, Monster,\" said the Phoenix hastily.\n\"After all, you have no need for the treasure, and it does absolutely\nno good buried under the ground.\"\n\n\"It doesn't do any harm there, either,\" said the Sea Monster. \"Really,\nPhoenix, I never thought _you_--\"\n\n\"Monster,\" said the Phoenix solemnly, \"_this_--is a matter of life or\ndeath.\"\n\n\"Life or death--ha!\"\n\n\"Please, Monster,\" said David. \"It really is life or death, because\nthe Scientist is chasing the Phoenix, and the Phoenix has a plan to\nescape him, and we need some money to carry out the plan so the\nScientist can't hurt the Phoenix.\"\n\n\"A few small coins will do,\" added the Phoenix, with a winning smile.\n\"A louis d'or, for example, or some pieces of eight. After which you\nmay bury the rest again.\"\n\n\"_Please_, Monster!\" David begged.\n\nThe Monster looked at David, and at the Phoenix, and then at David\nagain, and then at the lagoon. It sighed a very doubtful sigh.\n\n\"Oh ... all right,\" it said reluctantly. \"But for goodness sake, don't\ngo telling anyone where you found it.\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" said the Phoenix. And David leaped up and shouted\n\"Hooray!\" and grabbed the spade and his jacket.\n\n\"The stuff is on the next island,\" said the Sea Monster. \"I can swim\nover with you two on my back. This way, please--we have to leave from\nthe outer beach.\"\n\nThe Sea Monster was a magnificent swimmer. Its neck cut through the\nwater like the stem of a Viking ship, and it left a frothing wake\nbehind. Every once in a while it would plunge its head into the water\nand come up with a fish, which it would swallow whole.\n\n\"Should you like some breakfast, David?\" said the Sea Monster.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"No, thank you,\" David answered, \"but you go right ahead. Phoenix,\" he\nadded, \"what _are_ you doing?\"\n\nThe Phoenix, which had been walking up and down with its wings clasped\nbehind its back, stopped and gazed over the sea. \"Pacing the\nquarter-deck, my boy. Scanning the horizon. That is what one usually\ndoes at sea, I believe.\"\n\n\"You'll be wanting us to call you Admiral next,\" said the Sea Monster\nacidly.\n\nThey steamed on. Twenty minutes and seventy-six large breakfast fish\nlater they sighted the island--a little smudge on the horizon, dead\nahead.\n\n\"Land ho!\" a voice croaked. \"Thank heavens.\"\n\nDavid turned in surprise. The Phoenix was no longer pacing the\nquarter-deck and scanning the horizon. It was sitting limply with its\nhead down and a glassy stare in its eyes.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"You had better hurry up,\" David said to the Sea Monster. \"I think the\nPhoenix is seasick.\"\n\n\"Am not,\" the Phoenix gasped. \"Merely (ulp!) temporary.\"\n\nThe Sea Monster turned and smiled sweetly at the Phoenix. \"You'll get\nused to it in no time, Admiral.\"\n\nWhen they landed, however, the Phoenix recovered rapidly and even\nbegan to put on a slight nautical swagger. The Sea Monster humped off\ndown the beach, followed eagerly by the two treasure hunters. In a few\nminutes it came to a halt and sniffed the sand very carefully,\nswinging its head snakelike to and fro. It settled on one spot,\nsniffed it thoroughly, felt the sand with its whiskers, and then\nsolemnly announced: \"Here.\"\n\n\"Ahoy, me hearties!\" the Phoenix shouted. \"Turn to and stand by to\nsplice the main brace! Steady as she goes, mates!\"\n\nDavid needed no encouragement from anyone. He began to dig furiously.\nFlashing in the sun, the spade bit into the beach, and coarse white\nsand spurted in all directions. The Phoenix was quite as excited as\nDavid. It danced around the deepening hole with eyes asparkle,\nshouting such piratical terms as \"Shiver me timbers!\" \"Strike your\ncolors!\" and \"Give 'em no quarter, lads!\" Suddenly it began to beat\ntime with its wing and to sing in a raucous voice:\n\n    \"Cut the King's throat and take the King's gold--\n    Heave ho, bullies, for Panama!\n    There's plenty of loot for the lad who is bold--\n    Heave away, bullies, for Panama!\"\n\n\"You're flat on that last note,\" said the Sea Monster.\n\n\"My dear Monster, I have perfect pitch!\"\n\n\"Oh, yes--you have perfect sea legs, too.\"\n\n\"Well, ah--How are you coming along, my boy? Any signs of treasure?\"\n\nDavid did not hear. In fact he heard nothing from the first crunch of\nthe spade onward. His education was now richer by this fact: once you\nstart out after treasure, you can think of nothing else until it is\nfound. The sun was beating hotly on him, little rivulets of sweat\npoured down his face and arms, his muscles ached, blisters were\nbeginning to form on his hands. Heedless of all, he dug on. He had\nsettled into the rhythm of it now, and nothing could distract him.\n\n\"Tell you what's a good thing for seasickness,\" said the Sea Monster\nslyly. \"You take a--\" Pretending not to hear, the Phoenix stood first\non one leg and then on the other and stared into the sky. David dug\ntirelessly.\n\nSuddenly the spade grated on something solid, and they all jumped.\nDavid shouted \"Here it is!\" and shoveled up sand frantically. The\nPhoenix danced around the hole, also shouting. Even the Sea Monster\narched its neck to get a better view. They could see a brass ring,\ncrusted with verdigris, fastened to a partly-exposed piece of wood.\nThe sand flew. Now they could see studded strips of metal bound to the\nwood, and a rusty padlock. And in a few minutes a whole chest, with\nslanting sides and a curved lid and tarnished brass hinges, was\nuncovered. David threw the spade on the beach, seized the brass\nhandle, and tugged. It came off in his hand.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Here, let me,\" said the Sea Monster. David got out of the hole, and\nthe Sea Monster worked one flipper carefully under the chest. \"Look\nout,\" it said, and heaved its flipper up. The chest shot into the air,\ntumbled down end over end, and split wide open on the beach.\n\nDavid gasped. A dazzling, sparkling heap spilled out on the sand.\nThere were heaps of gold and silver coins, the silver black with\ntarnish but the gold still bright. There were pearls, rubies,\ndiamonds, beryls, emeralds, opals, sapphires, amethysts. And\nbracelets, necklaces, pendants, sunbursts, brooches, rings, pins,\ncombs, buckles, lockets, buttons, crucifixes. And carved pieces of\njade and ivory and coral and jet. And coronets, crowns, tiaras, arm\nbands. And jeweled daggers, picture frames, vases, silver knives and\nforks and spoons, sugar bowls, platters, goblets.\n\nFor an hour they examined the treasure. David fairly wallowed in it,\nexclaiming \"Look at this one!\" or \"Oh, how beautiful!\" or just\n\"Golly!\" The Phoenix muttered such things as \"King's ransom\" and\n\"Wealth of the Indies.\" The Sea Monster was not interested in the\ntreasure, but kept glancing nervously out to sea.\n\nAt last the Phoenix said, \"Well, my boy, I think we had better make\nour choice. Three or four coins should do it.\"\n\nThe Sea Monster gave a relieved sigh. \"Let's get the rest of it\nunderground right away. You have no idea what trouble it can cause.\"\n\nThe choice was difficult. There were so many coins, all of them with\nqueer writing and heads of unknown gods and kings. David finally\npicked out four gold pieces and tied them up in his handkerchief.\nThen the Sea Monster swept the rest of the treasure into the hole.\nThey all pushed sand in on top of it and jumped on the mound till it\nwas level with the rest of the beach.\n\nThe Phoenix turned to the Sea Monster and said solemnly: \"Monster, old\nfellow, I knew you would not fail us. You stood forth in our hour of\nneed, and we shall not forget.\"\n\nAnd David echoed, \"Thank you, Monster.\"\n\nThe Sea Monster ducked its head and blushed. A wave of fiery red\nstarted at its nose, traveled rapidly back over its ears, down its\nneck, along the body, and fanned out to the tips of its flippers and\nthe extreme end of the barb in its tail.\n\nEven its whiskers turned pink.\n\n\"Well--uh--glad to help--uh--nothing to it, really,\" it mumbled. Then\nit turned abruptly, galloped down to the sea, plunged into the surf,\nand was gone.\n\n\n\n\n7: _In Which the Phoenix's Plan Is Carried Out, and There Are More\nAlarums and Excursions in the Night_\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\"Now, my boy,\" said the Phoenix, when they got back to the ledge that\nafternoon, \"are the shops still open?\"\n\n\"I think they're open till six,\" said David, shaking the sand out of\nhis shoes. \"Are we going to buy something?\"\n\n\"Precisely, my boy. A hardware store should have what we need. Now,\nyou will take our gold and purchase the following.\" And the Phoenix\nlisted the things it wanted, and told David which to bring to the\nledge and which to leave below.\n\n\"... and a hatchet,\" the Phoenix concluded.\n\n\"We have one at home already,\" said David. \"Now, listen, Phoenix,\n_can't_ you tell me what all this is for? What are we going to do with\nit?\"\n\n\"My boy, the feline's existence was terminated as a direct result of\nits inquisitiveness.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\"\n\n\"Curiosity killed the cat,\" explained the Phoenix.\n\n\"Oh. But--\"\n\n\"Now, run along, my boy. A very important Thought has just come to me.\nI must Meditate a while.\" The Phoenix glanced at the thicket and hid a\nyawn behind one wing.\n\n\"Oh, all _right_,\" said David. \"I'll see you in the morning, then.\"\n\nIt wasn't until he got home that he thought of something. He couldn't\nspend pirate gold pieces, or even show them to anyone, without being\nasked a lot of embarrassing questions. What to do? Ask Dad or Mother\nor Aunt Amy to lend him some money? More embarrassing questions....\nWell, he would have to rob his bank. But wait--why hadn't he\nremembered? Just before they had moved, Uncle Charles had given him a\nten-dollar bill as a farewell present. He had been saving it for a\nmodel airplane, but the excitement of the last few days had driven it\ncompletely out of his mind. Of course the Phoenix's Plan was more\nimportant than any model plane could be.\n\nSo he kept the gold pieces tied up in his handkerchief and took his\nten dollars to a hardware store, where he bought what the Phoenix\nwanted--a coil of rope, an electric door bell, a pushbutton, and one\nhundred feet of insulated wire. Then he brought the package home, hid\nit behind the woodpile in the garage, and sat down to think.\nWire--bell--pushbutton. What could the Phoenix possibly want with\nthem? And what was the rope for? And the hatchet? The more he puzzled\nover it the more confused he became, and finally he just gave up.\nThere was only one thing he was sure about: whatever the Plan was,\nthey would have to carry it out as soon as possible. Two days had\npassed since the Scientist had shown up. The new gun he had ordered\nmight arrive at any time now. Perhaps even today, when they had been\ndigging up the pirate treasure, the Scientist had got his new rifle\nand had started to hunt through the mountains.\n\nThe thought gave David a creepy feeling on the back of his neck. They\ncertainly would have to hurry.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEarly next morning David climbed up to the ledge, bringing with him\nthe coil of rope and the hatchet. As an afterthought he had added a\npaper bag full of cookies.\n\n\"Here's the stuff, Phoenix,\" he called out as he stepped onto the\nledge. \"Where are you?\"\n\nThere was a crash from the thicket as though someone had jumped up in\nit suddenly, and the Phoenix stumbled out, rubbing its eyes.\n\n\"Ah, splendid, my boy! Yes. I was just--ah--Thinking.\"\n\n\"Phoenix,\" said David, \"I'm not going to ask you again what your Plan\nis, because I know you'll tell me when it's time. But whatever it is,\nwe'd better do it right now. The Scientist may show up any minute.\"\n\n\"Precisely, my boy. Never put off until tomorrow what can be done\ntoday. One of my favorite proverbs. We shall begin immediately--\" Here\nthe Phoenix caught sight of the bag in David's hand and added hastily:\n\"But, of course, we must not forget that first things come first.\"\n\n\"You might have brought more,\" said the Phoenix, fifteen minutes\nlater.\n\n\"There weren't any more in the jar,\" David said. \"Phoenix, please tell\nme what we're going to do. I don't care if curiosity _did_ kill the\ncat. I've been thinking about the rope and wire and bell all night,\nand I can't make heads or tails out of it.\"\n\nThe Phoenix gave a pleased laugh. \"Of course you cannot, my boy. The\nPlan is far too profound for you to guess what it is. But set your\nmind at rest. I shall now explain the rope and hatchet.\"\n\nDavid leaned forward eagerly.\n\n\"Now, scientists, you know, have fixed habits. If you know those\nhabits, you can predict just what they will do at any time. Our\nparticular Scientist is a daytime creature--that is to say, he comes\nat dawn and goes at dusk. His invariable habit, my boy!\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"There you are, my boy!\" said the Phoenix triumphantly. \"_We shall\nsleep during the day and continue your education at night!_\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said David. He thought about this a while, then asked, \"But\nsuppose the Scientist comes up on the ledge during the day and catches\nyou asleep?\"\n\n\"Aha! That is where the rope and hatchet come in. Never fear, my\nboy--I thought of that also. We are going to construct a snare at each\nend of the ledge.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"Hand me that twig, my boy.\" The Phoenix took the twig, found a bare\nspot of earth, and sketched a picture. \"First we find a sapling and\nclear the branches from it with the hatchet--like this. Next we get a\nstake, cut a notch in it, and drive it into the ground--so. The\nsapling is bent down to it and fitted into the notch, which holds it\ndown. You see, my boy? Now we make a noose--so--from a piece of rope,\ntie it to the end of the sapling, and spread the loop out on the\npath--this way. The whole snare is hidden under grass and leaves.\" The\nPhoenix beamed and flung out its wings in a dramatic gesture. \"Just\npicture it, my dear chap! The Scientist, smiling evilly as he skulks\nalong the path! The unwary footstep! The sapling, jarred out of the\nnotch, springing upward! The tightened noose! And our archenemy\ndangling by the foot in mid-air, completely at our mercy!\nMagnificent!\"\n\n\"Golly, Phoenix,\" said David, \"that's pretty clever.\"\n\n\"_Clever_, my boy? Better to say 'a stroke of genius.' Only I,\nPhoenix, could have thought of it. And consider the poetic justice of\nit! This is exactly the sort of trap that the Scientist once set for\nme! Well, shall we begin?\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe Phoenix had made the snares sound delightfully simple, but they\nsoon discovered that the job was harder than it sounded. First they\nhad to find the right kind of sapling, springy and strong. The sapling\nhad to be in the right place--one by the goat trail, the other at the\nfar end of the ledge. When they had been chosen, David had to shinny\nup them to lop off their branches. That was a very awkward business;\nthe saplings swayed and trembled under his weight, and he could only\nuse one hand for the hatchet. Then he had to make two stakes from\nstout, hard wood, cut a notch at one end, and drive them into the\nground with the flat of the hatchet. But the hardest part was trying\nto bend the sapling down to the stake and fitting it into the notch.\nIt took the weight of both of them to bring the sapling to the ground.\nIf they got the slightest bit off balance, it would spring up again.\nOnce David fell off; the sapling went _swish!_ back into the air,\nflinging the astonished Phoenix thirty feet up the mountainside.\n\nIt was not until afternoon, when the sun had turned ruddy and shadows\nwere beginning to stretch dark fingers across the land, that they\nfinished the job. But at last the saplings were set in the notches,\nthe nooses were formed and fastened on. Grass and leaves were strewn\nover the snares; chips, hewn branches, and other evidences of their\nwork were removed. They sat down and looked proudly at each other.\n\n\"My boy,\" said the Phoenix, \"I have had a wide, and sometimes painful,\nexperience with traps; so you may believe me when I say that these\nare among the best I have seen. We have done well.\"\n\n\"They're sure strong enough,\" David agreed, flexing his fingers to\ntake the stiffness out of them. \"But what are we going to do if the\nScientist does get caught in one?\"\n\n\"We shall burn that bridge when we reach it, my boy. Now, do you have\nthe pliers, wire-cutters, and screw driver below?\"\n\n\"Yes, they're down in the cellar. What are we going to do with them,\nPhoenix?\"\n\n\"Patience, patience! You will be told when the time comes. I shall\nmeet you tonight after dark, as soon as it is safe for me to come\ndown. I trust you will have everything ready?\"\n\n\"Are you coming _down_?\"\n\n\"Precisely, my boy. A risk, I admit, but a necessary one. There is a\nhedge at the back of your house, is there not? Splendid. You may await\nme there.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDavid, sitting in the shadow of the hedge, jumped when he heard the\nPhoenix's quiet \"Good evening, my boy.\"\n\n\"Phoenix,\" he whispered, \"how did you do it? Golly, I didn't see you\nat all, and it isn't even dark yet.\"\n\n\"I have been hunted long enough, my boy, to have learned a few tricks.\nIt is merely a matter of gliding close to the ground, selecting the\nbest shadows, and keeping a sharp lookout. Well, let us get on with\nthe Plan. Have you the tools here?\"\n\n\"Yes, here they are.\"\n\n\"Splendid! Now, my boy, since we must continue your education during\nthe night, it is necessary that we have some way of getting in touch\nwith each other. If you climb the mountainside in the dark, you may\nunwittingly fall into our own snare. It is far easier for me to come\ndown than it is for you to go up, and under cover of darkness I can do\nit quite safely. The question now is, how will you know when I have\narrived? That, my boy, is the nub, or crux, of the situation. A\ndifficult problem, you will admit. But I have worked out the\nsolution.\"\n\nThe Phoenix lowered its voice impressively.\n\n\"My boy, we are going to install this bell in your room, and the\npushbutton on the base of that telephone pole. When I arrive here at\nnight, I shall press the button to let you know that I am ready to go.\nA magnificent idea, isn't it?\"\n\nIt did not seem very practical to David. \"Well, Phoenix, that's a good\nidea,\" he said carefully. \"But how are we going to hide the wires?\nAnd what about the noise of the bell?\"\n\n\"Nothing to it, my boy! The wires? There are wires between your house\nand the telephone pole already--one more would not be noticed. The\nnoise? You have a pillow on your bed, under which the bell can be\nmuffled.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's true.\" It still sounded impractical.\n\n\"Just imagine it!\" the Phoenix continued enthusiastically. \"Perhaps\nlater we can install another bell at this end. Then we could learn\nMorse code and send messages to each other. Exactly like a private\ntelephone line!\"\n\nPut in this way, the idea had a certain appeal, and David found\nhimself warming to it. But there was another thing to consider.\n\n\"How about electricity, Phoenix?\"\n\n\"Look above you, my boy! The telephone pole is simply loaded down with\npower lines waiting to be tapped.\"\n\nThe Phoenix was evidently set on carrying out the Plan, and David did\nnot want to wear out the bird's patience with more objections.\nAnd--well, why not? There should be no harm in trying it out, anyway.\n\nThey gathered up the tools and walked along the hedge to the telephone\npole, which was in one corner of the yard. The Phoenix began to\nuncoil the wire, while David gazed up doubtfully at the shadowy maze\nof lines and insulators on the cross-arms.\n\n\"Electricity,\" said the Phoenix thoughtfully, \"is a complicated and\nprofound subject. There are amperes, and there are volts, and there\nare kilowatt hours. I might also mention positive and negative\nand--ah--all that sort of thing. Most profound. Perhaps I had better\ninvestigate up there. Screw driver, please.\"\n\nThe Phoenix took the screw driver in one claw and flew up to the top\nof the pole. David could hear the creak of the lines under the\nPhoenix's weight and the rattling of the screw driver against the\nporcelain insulators. For some minutes the Phoenix investigated,\nclicking and scraping about, and muttering \"Quite so\" and \"_There_ we\nare.\" Then it fluttered down again and rubbed its wings together.\n\n\"The whole situation up there is a lot simpler than I thought it would\nbe, my boy. The power lines merely come up to the pole on one side,\npass through the insulators, and go away from the pole on the other\nside. Child's play! The covering on the lines is rather tough,\nhowever. We shall have to use the wire-cutters.\"\n\nThe Phoenix returned to the top of the pole with the cutters, and\nworked on the wires for five more minutes. Bits of debris began to\nshower down on the hedge. One of the wires vibrated on a low note like\na slack guitar string.\n\n\"We must not forget the difference between alternating and direct\ncurrent, my boy,\" said the Phoenix as it flew down again. \"An\nimportant problem, that. Where is our wire? Ah, there we are. The\npliers, please.\"\n\n\"Do you need any help up there?\" David asked.\n\n\"No, everything is coming along beautifully, thank you. I shall have\neverything finished in a flash.\"\n\nTrailing one end of the wire in its beak, the Phoenix flew up into the\ndarkness once more. The tinkering sounds began again, and a spurt of\nfalling debris rattled in the leaves of the hedge.\n\nSuddenly it happened. There was a terrific burst of blue light, a\nsharp squawk from the Phoenix, and a shower of sparks. Another blue\nflash blazed up. The lights in the house, and down the whole street,\nflickered and went out. In the blackness which followed, each stage of\nthe Phoenix's descent could be heard as clearly as cannon shots: the\ntwanging and snapping as it tumbled through the wires, a drawn-out\nsquawk and the flop of wings in the air below, the crash into the\nhedge, the jarring thud against the ground. Broken wires began to\nsputter ominously and fire out sparks. A smell of singed feathers and\nburning rubber filled the air.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nBy the light of the sparks David saw the Phoenix staggering to its\nfeet. He jumped to the bird's side, but the Phoenix waved him away\nwith its wing.\n\n\"Quick, my boy,\" it gasped. \"We must make a strategic retreat! Meet me\non the ledge in the morning. Ouch!\" The Phoenix beat at the smoldering\nsparks in its tail and flew off, leaving a trail of acrid smoke\nhanging in the air.\n\nDavid had the presence of mind to gather up all the tools, the wire,\nbell, and pushbutton, and one of the Phoenix's feathers, which had\nbeen torn out during the fall. He slipped through a cellar window, hid\nthe equipment under a stack of old boxes, and ran noisily up the\nstairs into the kitchen.\n\n\"Hey!\" he shouted. \"The lights are out!\"\n\n\"Is that you, dear?\" came Mother's anxious voice from the dining room.\n\n\"The telephone's dead!\" Dad shouted from the hall.\n\nAunt Amy came bumping down the stairs with a candle. \"It's that\nburglar!\" she cried. \"Turning out all the lights so he can murder us\nin our beds!\"\n\n\"Look!\" David shouted, \"the line's broken in our back yard!\"\n\nThey could hear the wailing of sirens now. Fire trucks, repair trucks,\nand police cars pulled up in front of the house. Everyone in the block\nturned out to see what had happened. It took the repair men an hour to\nuntangle the wires and fix them. And all the time policemen were\ngoing through the crowd, asking questions and writing things down in\ntheir notebooks. They were looking rather haggard, David thought.\n\n\n\n\n8: _In Which David and the Phoenix Visit a Banshee, and a Surprise Is\nPlanted in the Enemy's Camp_\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\nNext day Mother asked David to help her straighten out the garden,\nwhich had been trampled by the repair men; so he could not go to see\nthe Phoenix until after lunch. But when that was finished, he rushed\nup the mountainside as fast as he could, wondering all the way what he\nand the Phoenix were going to do now.\n\nThe ledge was empty when he got there. He shouted, \"Phoenix!\" and\nlistened.\n\n\"Hel-l-lp!\" came a faint answering cry from the other end of the\nledge.\n\nDavid jumped through the thicket. A pitiful sight met his eyes. There\nwas the Phoenix, dangling by one foot from the snare, its wings feebly\nstruggling and its free foot clawing the air. The feathers of its\nwings and tail were singed. Great beads of sweat rolled from its\nforehead into a puddle on the ground below. The snared foot was blue\nand swollen.\n\n\"Get me down,\" gasped the Phoenix weakly.\n\nDavid took a running leap at the sapling, which broke under the sudden\nincrease of weight, and the two of them crashed to the ground. He\nunfastened the noose and dragged the Phoenix to the shadiest, softest\nspot on the ledge.\n\n\"Hoist with my own petard,\" said the Phoenix bitterly. \"Rub my foot,\nwill you? Oh dear oh dear oh dear! Hurts.\"\n\n\"What happened?\" David asked as he rubbed the swollen foot. \"How long\nhave you been caught?\"\n\n\"Missed my way in the dark,\" said the Phoenix, wiping its brow.\n\"Thought I was on the other side of the ledge, and landed right on\nthat fool trap. Hung there all night and all morning. Thought you\nwould never come, my boy. Oh dear, oh dear, what a horrible\nexperience! My tail was still on fire when I landed, too. I fully\nexpected to be burned to a crisp.\" A large tear rolled down the\nPhoenix's beak.\n\nDavid murmured soothing words and continued to chafe the Phoenix's\nfoot. \"Does it feel any better now?\"\n\n\"The feeling is coming back, my boy,\" said the Phoenix, gritting its\nbeak. \"Ouch! All pins and needles.\" It flexed its toes gingerly. \"Rub\na bit more, please. Gently.\"\n\nThe swelling began to go down. With a handful of damp grass David\nsoothed the marks left by the noose.\n\n\"That stupid Electric Company!\" the Phoenix suddenly burst out.\n\"Putting everyone in danger with a short-circuited power line! Let\nthis be a lesson to you, my boy. Anything worth doing is worth doing\nwell. They will hear from us, believe me! We shall write them a stiff\ncomplaint!\"\n\n\"Well, Phoenix,\" said David hopefully, \"we can set the snare again if\nwe can find another good sapling; and we still have the other one, so\nwe're pretty well protected. And why couldn't we meet every night by\nthe hedge, the way we did last night? The bell was a good idea, but\nwe _could_ get along without it.\"\n\nThe Phoenix sighed. \"I suppose you are right, my boy. There is no use\ncrying over spilt milk. One must set one's jaw and--good heavens, my\nboy! _Duck!_\"\n\nThe Phoenix threw itself to the ground and wildly motioned to David to\ndo the same. He flattened himself out beside the bird and said, \"What\nis it, Phoenix?\"\n\n\"Down the mountainside,\" whispered the Phoenix. \"Look! Do not stick\nyour head over too far.\"\n\nDavid wormed his way to the edge, peered down, and gasped. Below him,\non the grassy slope at the foot of the scarp, was a figure clad in\nkhaki. It was the Scientist.\n\n\"Do you think he saw us?\" the Phoenix whispered.\n\n\"I don't think so,\" David whispered back. \"He's looking off to the\nleft. Oh, Phoenix, what if he comes up here? What'll we do?\"\n\n\"Listen,\" hissed the Phoenix, \"run down there. Talk to him, lead him\naway, distract his attention, anything. Only be quick!\"\n\n\"All right!\"\n\nThe Phoenix melted into the thicket, and David jumped to his feet. As\nhe dashed down the trail his brain whirled with questions. What should\nhe do? What could he say? How could he lead the Scientist away? Where\nwould the Phoenix go?\n\nIn his haste he forgot one important thing. His foot tripped over the\npile of grass and leaves on the trail. The released sapling sprang\nupward, the noose tightened with a cruel jerk around his ankle, and he\nwas snatched into the air. As the blood rushed to his head he lost\ncontrol of himself and began to struggle wildly and shout at the top\nof his voice.\n\nThe flat dry voice of the Scientist drifted to him as if through a\nlong tunnel. \"What's all this? What are you doing here? Who set this\nsnare?\"\n\n\"Get me down,\" David choked. \"Please!\"\n\nA hand seized him by the scruff of the neck. A knife flashed through\nthe air and cut the rope. David landed on his feet, but his legs gave\nway and he dropped to his knees. He felt dizzy as the blood rushed\naway from his head again.\n\nThe Scientist tilted his sun helmet back and said, \"Well,\nwell--David,\" in a disagreeable tone. His eyes narrowed behind the\nspectacles. \"What is this snare doing here?\"\n\nDavid struggled to his feet and clutched a bush for support. \"Thank\nyou for cutting me down,\" he said.\n\nThe cold blue eyes found David's and held them in a hypnotic stare.\n\"What is this trap doing here? Who set it?\"\n\n\"I--I was coming down the trail and--and--I was caught in it,\" David\nstammered.\n\n\"You are avoiding my question, young man,\" said the Scientist.\n\"Who--set--this--snare? Answer me!\"\n\nThere was a brilliant flash of gold and blue in the sunlight, the\nwhistle of feathers cleaving the air, the sharp _thwock!_ of fisted\ntalons striking. The Scientist pitched forward with a surprised grunt\nand lay still across the trail--and the Phoenix, executing a flip in\nthe air to check its speed, settled down beside David.\n\n\"View halloo!\" it shouted excitedly. \"Yoicks and Tallyho! Did you see\nthat stoop, my boy? By Jove, the best-trained falcon could not have\ndone better! Believe me, I have been saving that blow for a long time!\nBy Jove, what a magnificent stoop! I think I shall take up\nScientist-hunting as a regular thing!\"\n\n\"Thank goodness, Phoenix!\" David exclaimed. \"Another minute and you\nwould've been too late! But I hope you haven't--hurt him very much.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, my boy,\" said the Phoenix. \"A head so stuffed with\nscientific fact cannot be injured. He will come to in a short while.\"\nThe Phoenix lifted the Scientist's sun helmet and examined the back of\nhis head. \"A large lump is developing, my boy. A most pleasant sight!\nI fear the sun helmet is now useless--crushed like an eggshell.\" And\nthe Phoenix smiled proudly.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Well, I hope it isn't serious,\" David said doubtfully. \"Anyway, we'll\nhave to do something.\"\n\n\"Precisely, my boy. But I think we should have a drink first.\" The\nPhoenix detached a canteen from the Scientist's belt and took a deep\nswig. \"Ah, delicious! Our friend is well prepared, my boy.\" And\nindeed, the Scientist had all sorts of things with him: a hand-ax, a\nsheath knife, a compass, a camera, binoculars, a stop watch, notebooks\nand pencils, a coil of rope, maps. There was also a packet of\nsandwiches, which the Phoenix opened and began to eat.\n\n\"Now, listen, Phoenix, we have to do something.\"\n\n\"Quite right, my boy,\" the Phoenix mumbled, with its mouth full. \"Have\na sandwich--spoils of war--peanut butter--very nourishing. The fact is\nthat I have just thought of another plan, which cannot fail. Have we\nany money left?\"\n\n\"Yes, four gold pieces. Why?\"\n\n\"Splendid. Now, my boy, I shall leave you. When the Scientist wakes\nup, you will help him down to wherever he lives. Find out where his\nroom is. I shall meet you by the hedge at midnight. Be sure you have\nthe gold pieces with you.\"\n\n\"All right. What are we--\"\n\n\"Sure you will not have a sandwich?\"\n\n\"No, thank you. What are we--\"\n\n\"Very well. Farewell, then, my boy. Till midnight.\"\n\nDavid poured what was left in the canteen over the Scientist's head\nand fanned him with a notebook. Presently the man stirred and groaned.\nThen he sat up and muttered, \"What hit me?\"\n\n\"Can you stand up yet?\" David said.\n\nToo dazed to ask any more questions, the Scientist got up, groaning,\nput on his broken spectacles, collected his scattered equipment, and\nleaned on David. The two of them proceeded slowly down the trail\ntogether, frequently sitting down to rest. The Scientist murmured the\nname of his hotel and pointed out the direction.\n\nTownspeople stared at them as they passed, but no one stopped them or\nasked questions, and they reached the hotel without further incident.\nThey entered the lobby, and the Scientist sank into a chair.\n\n\"Let me help you to your room,\" said David.\n\nIn a few minutes the Scientist got up again, and they took the\nelevator to the fourth floor. David closely watched the direction they\nwere going, and when they came into the Scientist's room, he looked\nquickly through the window. There was a fire escape just outside. He\nhad the information now: fourth floor, west side, fire escape by\nwindow.\n\nThe Scientist eased himself onto the bed with a groan.\n\nThen he turned to David and said severely: \"There's something strange\nabout all this, and I intend to get to the bottom of it. You'll be\nhearing from me, young man!\"\n\n\"All right,\" said David, closing the door. \"And you'll be hearing from\n_us_,\" he added in an undertone, \"if I know the Phoenix!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFlying at night was colder than flying by day, but it was more\nthrilling, too. They whistled through an immense blackness. Stars\nglittered overhead, and quicksilver patches of moonlight and shadow\nflashed across the clouds below. They were going to Ireland, but why,\nDavid did not know. The Phoenix was playing its wait-and-see game\nagain.\n\nIn an hour or so they shot out over the edge of the cloud mass, and\nDavid could see a rocky coast below, dark and cold in the half-light.\nThe Phoenix began to slant down toward it, and presently they landed\nin a little meadow. One side of the meadow ran down to a bog filled\nwith reeds, and on the other side was a gloomy wood. Everything was\ndark and indistinct, but David thought he could tell why the Phoenix\nhad called this the Emerald Isle. The grass beneath their feet was the\nthickest he had ever felt. He touched a boulder and found it furry\nwith moss. With the wood and the reed-choked bog, the whole place\nwould be rich with various greens in the daylight.\n\nJust then they saw a little man approaching them from the wood. He was\nthree feet tall, dressed all in green, and had a long white beard.\nWhen he reached them he raised his cap politely and said, \"Good\nevenin' to you.\"\n\n\"A fine evening to you, my good Leprechaun,\" said the Phoenix. \"Could\nyou kindly tell us--\"\n\n\"Will you have a cigar?\" the Leprechaun interrupted.\n\nWith a surprised \"Thank you very much,\" the Phoenix took the cigar,\nbit off the end, and popped it into its beak. The Leprechaun lighted\nit, and the Phoenix puffed away.\n\n\"Stick o' gum, lad?\" said the Leprechaun to David, holding out a pack.\n\n\"Why, yes, thank you,\" said David. He took the stick of gum from the\npack, and was immediately sorry for it. The stick was made of wood and\nhad a small wire spring, like a mouse trap, which snapped down on his\nfinger and made him yelp with pain. At the same instant the Phoenix's\ncigar exploded, knocking the startled bird backwards into a bush.\n\n\"Haw haw haw!\" shouted the Leprechaun, rolling on the ground and\nholding his sides. \"Haw haw haw!\"\n\nIn a trice the Phoenix had pounced on the Leprechaun and pinned him to\nthe ground.\n\n\"Let him up,\" said David furiously. \"I'll punch his head for him.\"\n\n\"I think, my boy,\" said the Phoenix coldly, \"that I shall carry the\ncreature up into the clouds and drop him. Or should we take him back\nwith us and hand him over to the Scientist?\"\n\n\"Now, don't take offense, Your Honor,\" said the Leprechaun. \"I thought\nyou'd look at it as kind o' comic.\"\n\n\"Exceedingly comic,\" said the Phoenix severely. \"I am quite overcome\nwith mirth and merriment. But perhaps--_perhaps_--I shall let you off\nlightly if you tell us where the Banshee lives.\"\n\n\"The--the Banshee of Mare's Nest Wood?\"\n\n\"The same. Speak!\"\n\nA new light of respect and fear came into the Leprechaun's eyes.\n\"She's a terror, she is. What'll you be wanting--\"\n\n\"None of your business!\" roared the Phoenix. \"Where is she?\"\n\nThe Leprechaun had begun to tremble. \"Follow the path yonder through\nthe wood until you reach the cave, Your Honor. You're not friends o'\nhers, are you? You'll not be telling on me? I'm real sorry for those\njokes, Your Honor.\"\n\nThe Leprechaun's fright was so genuine now that the Phoenix relented\nand let him go. The little creature dashed off like a rabbit into the\nbog.\n\n\"Let that be a lesson to you, my boy,\" said the Phoenix. \"Beware the\nLeprechaun bearing gifts. But I wonder why the thought of the Banshee\nfrightened him so?\"\n\nThey followed the path until they came to the mouth of a cave under a\nheap of rocks. The Phoenix plunged in, and David nervously followed.\nThe cave turned out to be a long passageway which led, after several\nturns, into a chamber.\n\nFrom the ceiling of this rocky vault hung an electric light bulb,\nwhich glared feebly through drifts of smoke. All around the walls were\nwooden boxes, stacked up to make shelves and cupboards. These were\nfilled with an astonishing array of objects: bottles, vials, alembics,\nretorts, test tubes, decanters, cages, boxes, jars, pots, skulls,\nbooks, snake skins, wands, waxen images, pins and needles, locks of\nhair, crystal balls, playing cards, dice, witch-hazel forks, tails of\nanimals, spices, bottles of ink in several colors, clay pipes, a\nsmall brass scale, compasses, measuring cups, a piggy bank which\nsquealed off and on in a peevish way, balls of string and ribbons, a\npile of magazines called _The Warlock Weekly_, a broken ukulele,\nlittle heaps of powder, colored stones, candle ends, some potted\ncacti, and an enormous cash register. In the middle of the chamber a\nlittle hideous crone in a Mother Hubbard crouched over a saucepan,\nstirring it with a wooden spoon. The saucepan was resting in the coals\nof an open fire, and smoke and steam together spread out in a murky,\nfoul-smelling fog.\n\nThe crone peered at them over the top of her spectacles and cackled,\n\"Come in, come in, dearies. I'll be with you as soon as ever I finish\nthis brew.\"\n\nThe Phoenix, who had been gazing around the chamber in surprise, said,\n\"My dear Banshee, since when have you taken up witchcraft? This is\nmost unexpected.\"\n\n\"Ah, 'tis the Phoenix!\" exclaimed the hag, peering at them again.\n\"Well, fancy that now! Och, you may well ask, and I'll be telling you.\n'Tis a poor life being a Banshee--long hours and not so much as\nsixpence in it for a full night's work, and I got that sick of it! So\nI changed me trade. 'Sure, you'll never make a go of it,' they told\nme, 'and at your age,' they says, 'and once you've got your station\nin life,' they says, 'there's no changing it.' 'It's in the prime of\nme life I am,' says I, 'and I'll not be changing me mind for all your\ncackling,' says I, 'and if certain mouths don't shut up,' says I,\n'I'll cast spells that'll make certain people wish they were dead.'\nThat set them back on their heels, you may be sure. Well, 'twas the\nbest decision of me life. The money pours in like sorrows to a widow,\nand I'll be retiring within the year to live out my days like a proper\nqueen.\"\n\nThen the Banshee caught sight of David and hobbled over to him,\npeering into his frightened eyes.\n\n\"Ah, the wee darling,\" she crooned, \"the plump little mannikin. What a\nbroth he'd make, to be sure.\" She pinched his arm, and he started back\nin terror. \"So firm and plump, to make the mouth water. Sell him to\nme, Phoenix!\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" said the Phoenix sharply. \"What we desire--\"\n\nAt this instant the contents of the saucepan began to hiss and bubble.\n\"Whoops, dearies, the brew is boiling!\" shrieked the Banshee, and she\nhobbled back to the fire to resume her work. She looked in a recipe\nbook, stirred, clapped her hands, sang hair-raising incantations in a\nquavery voice, and added a pinch of salt and sulfur. She sprinkled\nspices from a shaker, waved her wand, popped in a dead toad, and\nfanned up the fire with an ostrich plume.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Now for the hard part,\" she said, grinning at them toothlessly. She\nmeasured out a spoonful of green powder, weighed it in the scales, and\nflung it into the saucepan. There was a loud explosion. A huge blast\nof steam flared out and engulfed them. When it had cleared, they saw\nthe Banshee tilting the saucepan over a small bottle. One ruby drop of\nfluid fell into the bottle. It darted forth rays of light as it fell,\nand tinkled like a silver coin rolling down flights of marble steps.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe Banshee corked the bottle and held it up proudly to the light.\n\"Will you look at that, now?\" she crooned. \"The finest ever I brewed.\nAh, the mystic droplet! Some swain will be buying that, now, and\nputting it in a lassie's cup o' tea, and she'll be pining away for\nlove of him before the day's out.\"\n\nShe put the bottle on the shelf, pasted a label on it, and turned to\nthem with a businesslike air.\n\n\"Now, dearies, what'll you be wanting? Philtres? Poison?--I've a\nspecial today, only five shillings a vial. A spell? What about your\nfortunes?--one shilling if seen in the crystal ball, one and six if\nread from the palm. A hex?--I've the finest in six counties. A ticket\nto the Walpurgis Night Ball?\"\n\n\"We want a Wail,\" said the Phoenix. \"And we shall accept nothing but\nthe best and loudest you have.\"\n\n\"Ah, a Banshee's Wail, is it?\" cried the hag. \"You've come to the\nright shop, dearies, to be sure. Now, let me see....\" She hobbled to a\nshelf which contained a row of boxes, ran her finger along them,\nstopped at one, and took it down. \"Here we are--key of C-sharp, two\nminutes long, only five shillings threepence.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said the Phoenix. \"A larger one. We have something more than\nmice to frighten.\"\n\n\"A bigger one? Och, here's a lovely one, now--five minutes long,\nascending scale with a sob at the end, guaranteed to scare a statue.\nYours for ten and six. I call that a real bargain, now!\"\n\n\"Bah!\" said the Phoenix impatiently. \"Enough of these squeaks! We want\na real _Wail_, my dear Banshee--such a Wail as never before was heard\non the face of this earth. And stop this babbling about shillings and\npence. We are prepared to pay in gold.\" The Phoenix took the four\npieces of gold from David and carelessly tossed them into the air.\n\nThe Banshee's eyes flew wide open, and she twirled herself around like\na top. \"Och, the sweet music of its tinkling!\" she exclaimed. \"The\nlovely sheen of light upon it! _There's_ a sight for eyes used to\nnaught but silver! Ah, but dearies, I've no Wail worth four pieces of\ngold. I'll have to make one up special.\" She hobbled rapidly around\nthe chamber until she had found a box as large as a bird cage, and an\near trumpet. She opened the box, shook it to make sure it was empty,\nand put in two heads of cabbage. (\"Such monstrous appetites these\nWails do have!\" she explained.) She fastened the lid carefully with a\ncatch-lock, and inserted the ear trumpet in a hole in one side of the\nbox. Then she disappeared through a sound-proof door, which they had\nnot seen before on account of the smoke.\n\nFifteen minutes later the Banshee came out with the box, plugging up\nthe hole in its side with a bit of wax. She was pale and trembling,\nand beads of sweat covered her face. She smiled weakly at them, seized\nan earthen-ware jug, and drained it in one gulp. The color began to\nreturn to her face.\n\n\"Wsssht!\" she gasped, wiping her brow with the sleeve of her Mother\nHubbard. \"Ah, dearies, that was the effort of me life! 'Tis a Wail to\nmake one burst with pride, though I do say it meself. Thirteen minutes\nlong by the clock, with a range of ten octaves! 'Twould frighten the\nOld Nick himself!\"\n\n\"Splendid!\" said the Phoenix. \"The fact is, I sometimes suspect that\nthat is precisely with whom we are dealing at home.\"\n\nThe light suddenly dawned on David. \"Phoenix!\" he cried. \"I bet we're\ngoing to give the Wail to the Scientist!\"\n\n\"Precisely, my boy!\" The Phoenix beamed.\n\n\"Oh, golly golly golly!\" David sang as he danced around.\n\n\"And I'll guarantee it, dearies!\" the Banshee cackled. \"One hundred\nper cent satisfaction or your money back!\"\n\n\"Defeat and confusion to the enemy!\" the Phoenix shouted, giving the\nspecial squawk which was its battle cry.\n\nThe Banshee received her gold. The Phoenix told David for goodness\nsake not to drop the box or let the lid pop open, or they would regret\nit to their dying day. David, hearing the rustle of the Wail as it\nravenously attacked the cabbages inside the box, assured the Phoenix\nthat he would be careful. The Banshee said, \"Ah, Phoenix, do sell the\nladdie to me,\" but her tone was more teasing than serious, and they\nall laughed. Good-bys were said all round, and David and the Phoenix\nleft. The last thing they heard as they felt their way up the dark\npassage was the happy cackling of the Banshee and the clang of the\ncash register.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey got back to the hotel before dawn and very carefully crept down\nthe fire escape into the Scientist's room. They put the box on the\nbedside table, stuck out their tongues at the sleeping Scientist, and\ncrept out again. Then they went home, the Phoenix to the ledge and\nDavid to bed, where he fell asleep instantly.\n\nThe Wail was wildly successful. The Scientist released it from its box\nat seven o'clock in the morning. People living in the hotel thought\nthe world had come to its end. The rest of the town wondered if it was\na riot, or an earthquake, or both with three steam calliopes thrown\nin for good measure. David, who lived twelve blocks from the hotel,\nstirred in his sleep and dreamed he was riding a fire engine. Even the\nPhoenix claimed later that a kind of moan was borne on the breeze all\nthe way up to the ledge.\n\nThe hotel burst into activity like a kicked anthill. People poured\ndown the fire escapes, shot out through the doors, lowered themselves\ninto the street with ropes of knotted blankets. Others barricaded\nthemselves in their rooms by piling furniture against the doors and\nwindows. One guest found his way to the cellar and hid in an ash can\nfor two days. The manager crawled into the office safe and locked the\ndoor, without even bothering to remember that he was the only one who\nknew the combination. The telephone exchange was jammed as calls\nflooded in to mobilize the Boy Scouts, the Red Cross, the Salvation\nArmy, the National Guard, and the Volunteer Flood Control Association.\nWhen the Wail finally died out (which was not until seven-thirty,\nbecause it had devoured both cabbages during the night and had grown\nto more than twice its original size) the police entered the hotel in\nforce, armed to the eyebrows. They found nothing. At the end of a\nthree-hour search the Chief handed in his resignation.\n\nAs for the Scientist, he disappeared completely. A farmer living three\nmiles out of town said he saw a man, dressed in a nightshirt and\nhead-bandage, running down the valley road. The farmer guessed the\nman's speed to be thirty-five miles an hour. But, he added, there was\nsuch a cloud of dust being raised that he could not see very well.\n\n\"It might have been fifty miles an hour,\" he said.\n\nNo one doubted him.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\n9: _In Which David and the Phoenix Call On a Faun, and a Lovely\nAfternoon Comes to a Strange End_\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\nThe Phoenix was dead tired. And no wonder--all in one week it had\nescaped from Gryffons, raced with a Witch, made round-trip flights to\nthe Pacific Isles and Ireland, been caught in a snare, got burned by a\nshort circuit, and been knocked down by an exploding cigar. Even a\nbird as strong as the Phoenix cannot do all these things without\nneeding a rest. So the traveling part of David's education was\nstopped for a while to let the Phoenix recover.\n\nThe days went by pleasantly on the ledge. Summer was at its height.\nThe sun fell on them with just the right amount of warmth as they\nlolled on the grass. The air was filled with a lazy murmuring.\n\"Listen,\" the murmuring seemed to say, \"don't talk, don't think--close\nyour eyes and listen.\" Below them, the whole valley danced and wavered\nin the heat waves, so that it seemed to be under water.\n\nThere were long, lazy conversations that began nowhere and ended\nnowhere--the wonderful kind in which you say whatever comes to your\nhead without fear of being misunderstood, because what you say has\nlittle importance anyway. The Phoenix told of the times and adventures\nit had had. Of the forgotten corners of the world where life went on\nas it had from the beginning, and of friends who lived there. Of\nTrolls who mined metal from the earth and made from it wondrous\nmachines which whirred and clattered and clanked and did absolutely\nnothing. (\"The best kind of machine after all, my boy, since they\ninjure no one, and there is nothing to worry about when they break\ndown.\") Of Unicorns (\"Excellent chaps, but so frightfully melancholy\")\nwhich shone white in the sun and tossed their ivory horns like\nrapiers. Of a Dragon who, having no treasure to guard, got together a\npathetic heap of colored pebbles in its cave. (\"And really, he came to\nbelieve in time that they were absolutely priceless, and went about\nwith a worried frown of responsibility on his brow!\") David, in turn,\ntold the Phoenix about the games he used to play when he lived in the\nflat country, and all about school, and Mother and Dad and Aunt Amy\nand Beckie.\n\nHe could not help laughing now and then over the Scientist's defeat.\nBut whenever this came up, the Phoenix would shake its head with a\nkind of sad wisdom.\n\n\"My boy, there are certain things, such as head colds and forgetting\nwhere you have left your keys, which are inevitable--and I am afraid\nthat the Scientist is, too.\"\n\n\"Oh, Phoenix, you don't think he'll come back, do you?\"\n\n\"Yes, my boy, I do. I can see the whole train of events: He will\nrecover from his fright. He will be curious about the Wail, and will\nreturn to investigate it. Once here, he will remember us, and we shall\nhave to take him into account once more.\"\n\n\"Oh. Do you think it'll happen soon?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, my boy, nothing to worry about for the time being. But we\nmust remember that it will happen some day.\"\n\n\"Yes, I guess you're right. I think he's hateful!\"\n\n\"I cannot disagree with you there, my boy. Of course, I have no doubt\nthat, in general, the advancement of science is all to the good.\nKnowledge is power. But on days like this I sometimes wonder.... Does\nit not seem to you that the highest aim in life at the moment is to\nenjoy the sunlight and allow others to do the same?\"\n\n\"You're right, Phoenix--but then, you always are. I was just thinking\nthe same thing. It's funny ... I mean ... well, _you_ know. Why can't\npeople leave other people alone--and--and--well, just _enjoy_\nthemselves and lie in the sun and listen to the wind?\"\n\n\"That is the way of the world, my boy. Getting and spending, and all\nthat sort of thing. But come! Why should we worry over the follies of\nthe rest of the world? A day like this was made for living, not\nthinking. Begone, dull care!\"\n\nAnd they would forget the Scientist and watch a pair of butterflies\nchase each other instead.\n\nBut one day the Phoenix suddenly stood up with a startled expression\non its face. \"My dear chap!\" it exclaimed. \"I have just remembered!\nTomorrow....\"\n\n\"What about tomorrow?\"\n\n\"Why, my boy, tomorrow another century rounds its mark. To be brief,\ntomorrow is my birthday. My five hundredth birthday.\"\n\n\"Well, congratulations, Phoenix!\"\n\n\"Thank you, my boy. Five hundred.... Destiny.... Have I mentioned\nbefore, my boy, that I have a magnificent destiny?\"\n\n\"No. What is it, Phoenix?\"\n\n\"I--well, it is strange, my boy, but I do not know ... but that it is\nmagnificent no one can doubt.\"\n\n\"Do I have one too?\"\n\n\"Of course, my boy. We all do.\"\n\nDavid was glad of that. He did not know exactly what a destiny was,\nhowever, and he tried to think of how one would look. But the only\npicture which came to his mind was that of a small, mousy creature\n(his destiny) looking up in admiration to a splendid thing of flame\nand gold, dazzling to the eyes--the Phoenix's mysterious destiny.\n\nHe said, \"We'll have to do something special tomorrow to celebrate,\nPhoenix.\"\n\nThe Phoenix looked thoughtful. \"I think we had better do whatever we\nare going to do _today_,\" it said.\n\n\"Well, we can do something today _and_ tomorrow, then,\" said David.\n\"After all, a birthday only comes once a year, and it seems a shame to\nspend only one day on it. Especially when it's a five hundredth\nbirthday.\"\n\n\"Tomorrow ...\" said the Phoenix doubtfully. \"I have a strange feeling,\nmy boy--for once, I find myself unable to explain--most odd, _most_\nodd ... five hundredth birthday....\"\n\n\"Ah, well,\" it went on more cheerfully, \"I shall undoubtedly remember\nlater. The pressing question is, what shall we do now?\"\n\nDavid got up, thought for a while, and suddenly flung his arms wide.\n\"Oh, Phoenix,\" he cried, \"it's such a beautiful day, I wish it could\ngo on forever! Couldn't we go somewhere--somewhere where we--oh, I\ndon't know. I can't explain it. Anywhere _you_ say, Phoenix.\"\n\nThe Phoenix looked at him for a long time. \"I think I understand, my\nboy. Yes.... How about one of the forgotten places I told you about?\nShould you like to meet a Faun?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a green valley, completely enclosed by the barren mountains\nwhich towered above it. At one end a waterfall hung on the face of a\ncliff, a misty thread pouring into a rainbow-arched pool. A brook\nserpentined through fields and groves of trees. There were flocks of\nsheep and goats in the fields. Here and there were strange ruins of\nmarble and red granite--columns, peristyles, benches carved with\nlions' heads, and pedestals.\n\nThey landed in a little glade, and David got down in silent\nwonderment. The very stillness of the air was enchanted. The grass,\ndappled with sun and shadow, wore a mantle of flowers. Clouds of\nbutterflies sprang up at their approach and swirled about them. To\ntheir right stood two broken columns, half-hidden beneath a wild\ntangle of vine and clusters of purple grapes. Beyond was the forest,\ndark and cool and silent, with shafts of sunlight in it like golden\nspears pinning the forest floor to earth. There was no breeze. And as\nDavid stood there, scarcely daring to breathe, they heard the sound of\nshepherd pipes coming from the edge of the wood. It was a minor tune,\nbut somehow lilting too, with the rippling of water in it, and the\nlaughter of birds flying high, and the whisper of reeds as they bend\ntogether by the edge of streams, and the gaiety of crickets by night,\nand the pouring of summer rain.\n\nThe piping died away, and the Phoenix beckoned to the spellbound\nDavid. Together they walked across the glade, leaving behind them a\nwake of swirling butterflies. An immense oak stood at the edge of the\nforest. At its foot, on a bed of moss, sat the Faun.\n\nHe was the same size as David. From the waist down he was covered with\nshaggy hair like a goat's, and instead of feet he had cloven hooves.\nThe hair on his head was black and curly, and tumbled around small\npointed ears and a pair of short horns. His eyes were slanted slightly\nupward, and he had a pointed chin and a snub nose.\n\nThe Faun waved his pipes saucily at the Phoenix and gave a wry smile.\n\"Hullo, Phoenix! Back again to honor us with your wit and wisdom? What\ngems of advice have you got for us now?\"\n\n\"My dear Faun,\" said the Phoenix stiffly, \"I have brought my friend\nDavid, who is acquiring an education. We--\"\n\nThe Faun smiled at David. \"Want to race?\" he said.\n\n\"Sure,\" said David. \"Where to?\"\n\n\"One moment,\" harrumphed the Phoenix. \"What we--\"\n\n\"Down to that pedestal and back,\" said the Faun.\n\n\"All right. Wait till I tie my shoe.\"\n\nThe Phoenix harrumphed again. \"This is all very well in its place, but\nwe _should_--\"\n\n\"Ready?\" said the Faun. \"One, two, three, _go_!\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThey dashed for the stone marker. It was an even race until they\nreached the pedestal, but there David tried to turn without slowing\ndown, slipped on the grass, and went sprawling on his hands and knees.\nThe Faun knew better. He sprang at the pedestal with both hooves,\nbounced from it like a spring, and began to race back to the oak. But\nthen he too fell, tripping over a vine, and David shot past him and\ntouched the oak one jump ahead of him, shouting \"First!\"\n\nThey sat down on the moss, panting. The Faun said, \"You can really\nrun! I'm sorry you fell.\"\n\n\"Well, you fell too, so that makes us even,\" said David. They looked\nat each other and for some reason burst out laughing. They rolled\naround on the moss and laughed until tears came, while the Phoenix\nfidgeted in reproachful silence.\n\nWhen they had calmed down a little, the Faun said, \"Can you dance?\"\n\n\"No,\" said David. \"I wish I could, though.\"\n\n\"The educational value of dancing is practically nil,\" the Phoenix\nbegan severely. \"I advise--\"\n\n\"Sure you can dance,\" said the Faun. \"Listen.\" He brought the pipes to\nhis lips and began to play.\n\nAnd much to his surprise and delight, David found himself dancing as\nthough he had never done anything else in his life. The wonderful\nthing was that he did not have to think about what he was doing: the\nmusic was doing it all for him. He saw that even the Phoenix was\nshuffling around in time to the piping, and looking very embarrassed\nabout it, too.\n\n\"There,\" said the Faun when they had finished, \"you _can_ dance, and\nvery well. Even old Phoenix can dance.\" Suddenly he jumped up and\ncried, \"Let's go--come on!\" and started to run.\n\nDavid followed, not knowing where they were going and not caring. The\nPhoenix came after them, half running and half flying to keep up. They\nraced across the glade, through a stand of trees, and out into the\nmeadow beyond. There they came to a bank of daisies, and threw\nthemselves into the middle of it and began to pelt each other with\nblossoms. The Phoenix, finally caught up in the spirit of it,\ncollected a huge bunch while they were wrestling, flew suddenly over\nthem, and drowned them beneath a deluge of flowers. Near by was the\nstream. They splashed in the shallows, skipped pebbles over the\nsurface, and dug a harbor with two dikes in the sandy part of the\nshore. The Faun showed David how to build little boats of reeds, and\nthe Phoenix made them sail by blowing up a wind with its wings.\n\nThey had a tree-climbing contest, which David won because his feet\nwere better than hooves for standing on branches. But the Faun won the\njumping contest because of the tremendous spring in his legs. They\ncame out even in the handstand, somersault, and skin-the-cat contest.\nAnd the Phoenix won when they played skip-rope with a piece of vine,\nbecause it could hover in the air with its wings while the vine\nswished over and under.\n\nThey had fun with the sheep and goats, too. The Faun made the animals\ndance and caper to a tune from his pipes, and showed David how to\nride on the rams. You crept up very quietly from behind--jumped\nsuddenly on their backs--got a quick grip around their necks--and away\nin a rush! It was almost as good as flying, except that you got jolted\noff sooner or later. Then watch out!--it took some quick dodging to\nescape the horns of the angry rams. They left the goats alone, because\nof their sharper horns and the wicked look in their eyes.\n\n\"I know where some pictures are,\" said the Faun. \"Come on!\" And he led\nthem to a kind of glade ringed with shattered columns. The ground\nthere was covered with moss and drifts of leaves. They each got a\nstick to clear away the debris, and uncovered a beautiful mosaic\npavement. It was made of bits of colored stone and tile, which were\narranged to make pictures. There were scenes of youths treading out\nwine, minstrels with lyres, gods with curly hair, and a beast which\nwas half man and half horse. There were maidens dancing to flute and\ndrums, hunters battling with boars and lions, warriors clashing with\nsword and shield and spear. There were series of pictures telling\nstories of wonders and adventures in far-distant lands, voyages, wars,\nconquests. The Faun proudly pointed out a picture of other Fauns\ndancing with Nymphs. The Phoenix gazed very thoughtfully at some\nscenes of a bird building and sitting in a nest of flames. But the\nlast pictures of this story had been broken up by roots, so they could\nnot see how it ended.\n\nWhen they came to the end of the valley, where the rainbow arched over\nthe pool, David told them of the pot of gold which is supposed to be\nat the foot of rainbows. They looked for it, but without success,\nbecause the rainbow disappeared whenever they got too close to it. So\nDavid and the Faun contented themselves with jumping into the pool and\nducking each other and making bubbly noises, while the Phoenix, who\ncould not swim, stood on the shore and beamed at them. They picked\nferns from under the waterfall and made wreaths and garlands, which\nthey threw at the Phoenix's head like quoits. The Faun showed them a\ncertain place to shout from if you wanted to hear an echo. The Phoenix\nshouted, \"A stitch in time saves nine!\" and the echo dolorously\nanswered, \"A switch is fine for crime.\"\n\nWet and tired from splashing in the pool, they stretched out in the\nsun to dry. A grapevine grew near them, and they gorged themselves on\nthe fruit, smearing their faces and hands with purple. And David\nclosed his eyes and thought, \"Now I'm having a dream, and so is the\nPhoenix. We're all dreaming the same thing and living in the dream,\nand I wish--oh, I wish none of us will ever wake up!\"\n\nBut he had just opened his eyes again when the Faun leaped to his feet\nand cried \"Listen!\" and flicked his pointed ears forward like a cat.\n\nDavid stood up and said in a puzzled voice, \"I don't hear anything.\"\nHe noticed that the Phoenix had also got up, and was listening\nuncomfortably to whatever it was.\n\n\"Listen! Oh, listen!\" cried the Faun. There was a joyous light in his\neyes as he leaned forward with his lips slightly parted, straining\ntoward the mysterious silence. Suddenly he shouted, \"I'm coming, I'm\ncoming!\" and dashed off into the wood.\n\n\"Good heavens,\" muttered the Phoenix. \"I had forgotten about--this.\nLet us go home, my boy.\"\n\nA strange, uncontrollable trembling had seized David's legs. He still\ncould hear nothing, but some feeling, some hint of an unknown,\ntremendous event hung quivering in the air about them and sent little\nelectric thrills racing up and down his whole body.\n\n\"Oh, Phoenix, what is it, what is it?\" he whispered.\n\n\"I think we had best be going, my boy,\" said the Phoenix anxiously.\n\"Come along.\"\n\n\"Phoenix--\" But he heard it now. It came whispering toward them, the\nsound of pipes caroling--pipes such as the Faun had played, but\ngreater, as an organ is greater than a flute. The wild, sweet sound\nrose and fell, swelled like a full choir, diminished into one soprano\nvoice that pierced David through and through, caressing and tugging,\ncalling, \"Come ... come ... run ... run....\"\n\n\"Phoenix!\" David cried. \"Oh, Phoenix, listen, listen!\"\n\n\"Run ... run ...\" the pipes whispered.\n\n\"Let us go home, my boy,\" said the Phoenix warningly.\n\n\"Come ... come ...\" cried the pipes.\n\nThey could be resisted no longer. In a transport of joy, David shouted \"I'm\ncoming!\" and raced away toward the sound. There was nothing in his mind\nnow, nothing in the whole world, but a desire to be near those pipes. He\nmust run like the winds, leap and shout, roll in the grass, throw himself\ndown flowered slopes, follow that magic music wherever it should lead. He\nfled blindly through the wood, heedless of the branches which whipped his\nface and the thorns which tore at his legs. The pipes were calling more\nloudly now: \"Run ... run ... faster ... faster....\" Then the Phoenix\nplunged to earth in front of him, threw out both wings, and shouted \"Stop!\"\n\n\"Let me go, Phoenix!\" David cried. \"Let me by! I want to run, I must\nrun!\"\n\nHe made a desperate effort to push past the outstretched wings. But\nthe Phoenix flung him to the ground, picked him up before he could\nkick once, and threw him on its back. Then they were flying at full\nspeed, dodging through gaps in the branches and between close-set\ntrunks, with leaves and twigs slashing them from every side. They\nburst out of the wood and sped over a meadow. David saw below them a\nhuge Faun-like figure pacing majestically across the sward. A flaming\nwreath encircled its brow, garlands of flowers hung from its arms and\nshoulders, and those enchanted pipes were lifted to its lips. Around\nthe cloven hooves, and trailing out behind, danced a multitude of\ncreatures--lambs and kids gamboling, goats and rams tossing their\nhorns, foxes, furry waves of squirrels, rabbits kicking up their\nheels, Fauns and Nymphs rollicking, frogs and crickets and serpents.\nAbove them flew birds and butterflies and beetles and bats in swirling\nclouds. Full-voiced, the glorious pipes sang. \"Come, come, run, run!\nFollow, leap and dance, adore and obey! Run, oh, run, heed me before\nall passes! Follow, before it is too late, too late, too late....\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAnd David, in a delirium of desire, shouted \"I'm coming!\" and jumped\nfrom the Phoenix's back.\n\nFor an instant, as he fell through the air, he thought he would\nsucceed in joining the dancing throng. But the Phoenix, plunging after\nhim falconwise with folded wings, seized his collar in its talons, and\nsnatched him up from the very arms of the Faun, who had recognized him\nand called his name as he fell.\n\nUp toward the cloudless sky they soared. David cried, pleaded,\npommeled the Phoenix with his fists. The Phoenix ignored his\nstruggling and continued to climb with tremendous wing strokes. Up and\nup and up.... The piping grew fainter in the distance, its magic\nweakened. The enchanted dancers diminished into specks, the valley\nfell away until it was only a green splash nestled among the jagged\npeaks. And David burst into tears ... and then wondered why he was\ncrying ... and tried to remember, and could not. The trembling left\nhis body, and he dangled limply. His eyes closed.\n\n\n\n\n10: _In Which a Five Hundredth Birthday Is Celebrated, and the Phoenix\nBows to Tradition_\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\"That's funny,\" said David, rubbing his eyes and looking around in a\npuzzled way. \"Where are we, Phoenix?\"\n\n\"'Home is the sailor, home from the hill,'\" the Phoenix said, \"'And\nthe hunter home from the sea.' Or is it the other way around? At any\nrate, we are home, my boy.\"\n\nAnd so they were.\n\n\"Weren't we playing with a Faun just now?\"\n\n\"Quite so.\"\n\n\"But there was something else,\" David said. \"Something ... Didn't\nsomebody say, 'Follow, before it is too late,' or something like that?\n_Did_ we follow?--I can't remember.\"\n\n\"No, my boy. By the time one hears that, it is already too late.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" Too late for what? he wondered. Oh, well ... He sighed, and fell\nto daydreaming.\n\nA cough from the Phoenix brought him back.\n\n\"Beg your pardon?\"\n\n\"I have never seen you so thoughtful, my boy. However, I believe I\nknow what you are thinking about. It _is_ a difficult problem, is it\nnot?\"\n\n\"Yes, I was just--\"\n\n\"--thinking what you could get me for a birthday present,\" interrupted\nthe Phoenix. \"Am I not correct?\"\n\nDavid, who had not even given this a thought until now, flushed.\n\n\"Aha!\" said the Phoenix triumphantly. \"Just as I thought! Believe me,\nmy dear fellow, when you have been around as long as _I_ have, you can\nread the minds of your friends as easily as a book. Now, the problem\nof what to give is a hard one at any time, but the problem of what to\ngive for a five hundredth birthday is even harder. A monogrammed ash\ntray? I do not receive cigars often enough to make that practical. A\nhand-knitted sweater? It would not fit (they never do). A gold-plated\nwatch chain? I have no watch. No, the best idea would be to get me\nsomething which I can use.\"\n\n\"Certainly, Phoenix,\" David stammered. \"What _do_ you want, then?\"\n\n\"Ah! We have reached the kernel of the problem. And the answer, my\nboy, is this: cinnamon.\"\n\n\"Cinnamon?\"\n\n\"Precisely. Also a box of matches--the kind that strike anywhere, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"Well--all right. It doesn't sound like much of a present, but if\nthat's what you really want.... What are you going to do with them,\nPhoenix? I mean, if you don't mind my asking.\"\n\n\"The plain fact is, my boy,\" said the Phoenix doubtfully, \"the plain\nfact is--well, I do not know. Odd! But something tells me I shall need\nthem. Well, it will come to me in the morning, no doubt. And then, of\ncourse, I shall be very glad to have them on hand.\"\n\n\"All right, cinnamon and matches, then. And I'll get some--no, I won't\ntell you _that_. It'll be a surprise.\"\n\n\"A surprise? Splendid, my boy! You could not, I suppose, drop me a\nsmall hint? No? But of course not--one hint and my powerful Intellect\ncould guess everything--and then the surprise would be spoiled. Well,\nuntil tomorrow, then!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThat evening David shut himself in his room and robbed his bank. It\nwas a squat, cast-iron box, with \"A Penny Saved Is A Penny Earned\" in\nraised letters on one side. The only way to open it was to smash it\nwith a crowbar, but it could be emptied. It had to be tilted just so,\nwith a knife blade in the slot to catch the coins and guide them out.\nThis is what David did, with a bread knife borrowed from the kitchen.\nIt was a slow, uncertain job, and one coin (he guessed it was a dime\nby the way it rattled) never did come out. But the rest, which\nincluded his change from Uncle Charles's present, would be enough.\n\nEarly next morning he went to the store and bought three large boxes\nof stick cinnamon, two cans of powdered cinnamon, and a huge box of\nmatches. For the surprise he got a whole quart of strawberry ice\ncream, with a piece of dry ice to keep it from melting. He wanted to\nbuy a cake, too, and candles, but there was not enough money left.\nThen he remembered that a new batch of cookies had been baked at home\nyesterday, which would have to do instead. He wrapped the cinnamon and\nmatches up in a neat package with white paper, tied it in a blue\nribbon, and wrote on it \"To Feenix, Happy 500 Birthday, from David.\"\nThen he took all the cookies from the jar, borrowed two plates and\nspoons, put everything into a large paper bag, and set out for the\nPhoenix's ledge.\n\nHe was surprised to find the Phoenix working busily in the middle of a\nwide place on the ledge. Apparently the bird had been at it all night,\nfor a huge pile of sticks and brush had been heaped up on the ground\nand shaped roughly like a nest. Right now the Phoenix was struggling\nwith a small log, trying to get it on the pile.\n\n\"Hello, Phoenix! Happy birthday!\"\n\n\"Ah, there, my boy! Thank you very much. Could you kindly give me a\nhand with this log?\"\n\nThey heaved and grunted the piece of wood to the top of the pile, and\nDavid said, \"What's this for, Phoenix?\"\n\n\"This, my boy, is a pyre. A bit untidy around the edges, but\nnonetheless a pyre.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said David. \"What's that?\"\n\n\"Well--a _pyre_, you know--a sort of fire, as it were.\"\n\n\"Oh, _fire_. I thought you said--oh, yes. Fire. Isn't it awfully\n_warm_ for a fire?\"\n\n\"The weather _is_ unusually tropical,\" said the Phoenix, cocking one\neye toward the sun. \"This fire, however, is necessary--but I shall\nexplain later. Meanwhile, if you will just aid me with this branch--\"\nAnd for the next fifteen minutes they worked over the heap, adding to\nit and shaping it up. David kept his thoughts to himself. He could see\nthat the Phoenix knew what it was doing, so everything must be all\nright.\n\n\"By the way, my boy,\" said the Phoenix casually, when they had\nfinished, \"my prediction was correct. I knew it would be. The\ninevitable has occurred.\"\n\n\"What are you talking about, Phoenix?\"\n\n\"The Scientist, my boy. He is in our midst once more.\"\n\nDavid clutched a branch in the heap and said \"Oh, Phoenix!\" in a\nfrightened voice.\n\n\"Now, my dear fellow, there is no cause for alarm. He is not nearby at\npresent. I sent him back.\"\n\n\"Sent him back? How?\"\n\n\"Nothing to it, my boy,\" said the Phoenix smugly. \"He was up at the\ncrack of dawn, toiling with typical stupidity in full sight on the\nslope below. He was making a blind of green branches to hide in while\nhe spies on me. (Really, the childishness of his efforts! To think for\na minute he could fool _me_ with such tricks!) Well, I waited until he\nhad gone down the slope to cut more greenery, and when his back was\nturned, I slipped down to the blind and took his binoculars.\"\n\n\"But Phoenix, what did you want with his binoculars?\"\n\n\"I did not want his binoculars, my boy, but _he_ did. His language\nwhen he discovered the loss was simply frightful--I could hear it all\nthe way up here. Of course, he had to return to town for another\npair.\"\n\n\"But he'll be back!\"\n\n\"Precisely, my boy. But he will have something to keep him busy when\nhe returns. I took the liberty of destroying his blind. _That_ will\nhold him.\"\n\n\"But it won't hold him long, Phoenix! We've got to think of something\nelse. Now your whole birthday is spoiled!\"\n\n\"On the contrary, my boy, it will hold him long enough. Now please do\nnot ask me why; you must take my word for it, and I shall explain\nlater. And my birthday is _not_ spoiled. I am looking forward with a\ngreat deal of pleasure to the surprise which you promised me. Come,\nlet us enjoy it, whatever it is, and forget the Scientist.\"\n\n\"Well ... are you _sure_ about the Scientist?\"\n\n\"Absolutely.\"\n\nThe Phoenix was so positive that David began to feel better. He picked\nup the paper bag and said: \"Well, it isn't much of a surprise,\nreally--just a birthday party. And your present. But I think the\npresent should come after the party, don't you?\"\n\n\"Quite so, my boy. But I shall leave the management of the whole\naffair in your capable hands.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said David. \"Now, you'll have to turn around, Phoenix,\nand not look while I'm getting it ready.\"\n\nThe Phoenix obediently turned around, clasping its wings behind its\nback, and tried hard not to peek. David set the party things out on\nthe grass: ice cream in the middle, the cookies in a ring around it,\nplates on either side, and spoons beside the plates. He set the\nPhoenix's present off to one side, where it could be reached when they\nhad finished.\n\n\"All right, Phoenix, you can turn around now.\"\n\nThe Phoenix took a long look at everything, and said huskily: \"My dear\nchap, this is quite the nicest moment of my life. How can I possibly\nthank you?\"\n\nThey sat down in their places. David passed the cookies and served the ice\ncream, and said that as far as he was concerned, this was the best birthday\nparty he had ever been to. And the Phoenix said, \"Quite so, my boy, but\nmight I make so bold as to ask why?\" And David answered, \"Well, the reason\nis that usually during birthday parties you have to play stupid games, like\npin-the-tail-on-the-donkey and button-button-who-has-the-button, in spite\nof the fact that eating good things is the real reason for having a party,\nas everybody knows.\" And the Phoenix said, \"Precisely, my boy, but people\nhave somehow lost the main idea of the thing. When you come right down to\nit, ice cream is the basis of any sensible party, and everything else is a\nwaste of time.\" And David said, \"Yes, Phoenix, but don't forget cake and\ncookies, and candy and nuts and things. They're not as good as ice cream,\nbut they're not a complete waste of time, either.\" And the Phoenix said,\n\"Of course not, my dear fellow, they are important too. And speaking of ice\ncream, have you noticed that, while chocolate is very good, and vanilla\nenjoys great popularity, still there is _nothing_ like strawberry?\" And\nDavid said, \"Yes, you're right\"--rather sadly, because the Phoenix was\neating most of it.\n\nAt last the ice cream carton was empty and all the cookies were gone.\nThey both sighed regretfully and brushed away the crumbs. And the\nPhoenix looked hopefully at the present David had brought.\n\n\"Happy birthday, Phoenix,\" David said, and he handed the gift over\nwith a little bow.\n\n\"Thank you, my boy, thank you.\" The Phoenix opened the package eagerly\nand gave a pleased cry. \"_Just_ what I wanted, my dear chap!\"\n\n\"I'm glad you like it,\" David said. \"Do you know yet what it's for?\nCan you really use it for something?\"\n\nThe Phoenix suddenly stopped smiling and looked at David with a\nstrange expression on its face--an expression David had never seen\nthere before. A vague dread swept through him, and he faltered,\n\"Phoenix ... you _do_ know what it's for? What is it? Tell me.\"\n\n\"Well, my boy--well, the fact _is_--yes, I do know. It came to me this\nmorning while I was constructing the--ah--nest, here. I am afraid it\nwill be a bit hard to explain. The cinnamon--ah--the cinnamon--well,\ncinnamon _branches_ are what I should really have....\"\n\n\"But Phoenix, what's it _for_?\"\n\n\"Behold, my boy.\" The Phoenix opened the boxes, and spread the\ncinnamon sticks on the nest. Then it took the cans and sprinkled the\ncinnamon powder over the top and sides of the heap, until the whole\nnest was a brick-dust red.\n\n\"There we are, my boy,\" said the Phoenix sadly. \"The traditional\ncinnamon pyre of the Phoenix, celebrated in song and story.\"\n\nAnd with the third mention of the word \"pyre,\" David's legs went weak\nand something seemed to catch in his throat. He remembered now where\nhe had heard that word before. It was in his book of explorers, and it\nmeant--it meant--\n\n\"Phoenix,\" he choked, \"wh-wh-who is the pyre for?\"\n\n\"For myself,\" said the Phoenix.\n\n\"_Phoenix!_\"\n\n\"Now, I implore you--please--oh, dear, I _knew_ it would be difficult\nto explain. Look at me, my boy.\"\n\nDavid did as he was told, although his eyes were filled with tears and\nhe could not see through the blur.\n\n\"Now,\" said the Phoenix gently, \"the fact is that I have, besides my\nunusually acute Intellect, an Instinct. This Instinct told me that it\nwas my birthday today. It also told me to build this nest of cinnamon.\nNow it tells me that I must make this nest my pyre, because that is\nwhat the Phoenix does at the end of five hundred years. Now, please,\nmy boy!--I admit it does not appear to be a very joyful way of\ncelebrating, but it must be done. This is the traditional end of the\nPhoenix, my boy, and we cannot ignore the tradition, no matter what\nour feelings may be. Do you see?\"\n\n\"No!\" David cried. \"Please, Phoenix, don't do it! It's horrible! I\nwon't let you do it!\"\n\n\"But I must, my dear chap! I cannot help it. This is what it means to\nbe the Phoenix. Nothing can stop the tradition. Please, my boy, do not\ntake on so! It is not in the least horrible, I assure you. My Instinct\ntells me so.\"\n\n\"You said you were going to give me an education,\" David sobbed. \"You\nsaid we would see--you said--and we've only been on four\nadventures--you never told me about this--\"\n\n\"I am terribly sorry, my boy. I could not tell you about it because I\ndid not _know_ about it until now. As for your education, it is a pity\nto have it cut short in this way. I had great plans.... But\nconsider--you have had four adventures which no one else in the whole\nworld has had! And besides, my boy, we shall see each other again. I\ndo not know how or where, but I am positive of it.\" The Phoenix\nflicked a tear from its eye with the tip of one wing, while with the\nother it patted David awkwardly on the shoulder.\n\n\"Don't go, Phoenix, _please_ don't go.\"\n\n\"I must, my boy. Here, permit me to present you with a small token\n(ouch!) of our friendship.\"\n\nDimly, through his tears, David saw the Phoenix pluck the longest,\nbluest feather from its tail, and he felt it being pressed into his\nhand.\n\n\"Good-by, David,\" said the Phoenix gruffly.\n\nDavid could stand it no longer. He turned and rushed blindly from the\nPhoenix, blundered into the thicket, and dropped to the ground with\nhis head buried in his arms. Behind him he heard the sticks snapping\nas the Phoenix mounted its pyre. A match rasped against the box. The\nfirst tongue of flame sizzled in the branches. David pressed his hands\nover his ears to shut out the sound, but he could feel the heat of the\nflames as they sprang up. And the noise would not be shut out. It grew\nand grew, popping, crackling, roaring, until it seemed to fill the\nworld....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPerhaps he fainted. Or perhaps from numbness he slipped into a kind of\ndeep sleep. Whichever it was, he returned to consciousness again\nsuddenly. His hands had slipped from his ears, and a sound had brought\nhim back. He lifted his head and listened. The fire had burnt itself\nout now. The only noise was the hiss and pop of dying embers. But\nthese sounds were too gentle to have awakened him--it must have been\nsomething else. Yes--it was a voice. He could hear it quite plainly\nnow. There were angry shouts coming from somewhere below the ledge.\n\nCarefully avoiding the sight of the pyre, David crawled to the edge\nand glanced over. Far down, on the slope at the foot of the scarp, was\na tiny figure dancing and bellowing with rage. The Scientist had\nreturned and discovered the ruins of his blind. David watched him\ndully. No need to worry about _him_ any more. How harmless he looked\nnow, even ridiculous! David turned away.\n\nHe noticed then that he was holding something in his hand, something\nsoft and heavy. As he lifted it to look more closely, it flashed in\nthe sunlight. It was the feather the Phoenix had given him, the tail\nfeather. Tail feather?... But the Phoenix's tail had been a sapphire\nblue. The feather in his hand was of the purest, palest gold.\n\nThere was a slight stir behind him. In spite of himself, he glanced at\nthe remains of the pyre. His mouth dropped open. In the middle of the\nwhite ashes and glowing coals there was movement. Something within was\nstruggling up toward the top. The noises grew stronger and more\ndefinite. Charred sticks were being snapped, ashes kicked aside,\nembers pushed out of the way. Now, like a plant thrusting its way out\nof the soil, there appeared something pale and glittering, which\nnodded in the breeze. Little tongues of flame, it seemed, licking out\ninto the air.... No, not flames! A crest of golden feathers!... A\nheave from below lifted the ashes in the center of the pile, a fine\ncloud of flakes swirled up into the breeze, there was a flash of\nsunlight glinting on brilliant plumage. And from the ruins of the pyre\nstepped forth a magnificent bird.\n\nIt was the Phoenix, it must be the Phoenix! But it was a new and\ndifferent Phoenix. It was young and wild, with a fierce amber eye; its\ncrest was tall and proud, its body the slim, muscular body of a\nhunter, its wings narrow and long and pointed like a falcon's, the\ngreat beak and talons razor-sharp and curving. And all of it, from\ncrest to talons, was a burnished gold that reflected the sun in a\nthousand dazzling lights.\n\nThe bird stretched its wings, shook the ash from its tail, and began\nto preen itself. Every movement was like the flash of a silent\nexplosion.\n\n\"Phoenix,\" David whispered. \"Phoenix.\"\n\nThe bird started, turned toward him, looked at him for an instant with\nwild, fearless eyes, then continued its preening. Suddenly it stopped\nand cocked its head as if listening to something. Then David heard it\ntoo: a shout down the mountainside, louder and clearer now, excited\nand jubilant. He shivered and looked down. The Scientist was tearing\nup the goat trail as fast as his long legs would carry him--and he was\nwaving a rifle.\n\n\"Phoenix!\" David cried. \"Fly! Fly, Phoenix!\"\n\nThe bird looked at the Scientist, then at David, its glance curious\nbut without understanding. Paralyzed with fear, David remained on his\nknees as the Scientist reached an open place and threw the gun up to\nhis shoulder. The bullet went whining by with an ugly hornet-noise,\nand the report of the gun echoed along the scarp.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Fly, Phoenix!\" David sobbed. A second bullet snarled at the bird, and\nspattered out little chips of rock from the inner wall of the ledge.\n\n\"Oh, fly, fly!\" David jumped up and flung himself between the bird\nand the Scientist. \"It's me!\" he cried. \"It's David!\" The bird gazed\nat him closely, and a light flickered in its eye as though the name\nhad reached out and almost, but not quite, touched an ancient memory.\nHesitantly it stretched forth one wing, and with the tip of it lightly\nbrushed David's forehead, leaving there a mark that burned coolly.\n\n\"_Get away from that bird, you little idiot!_\" the Scientist shrieked.\n\"_GET AWAY!_\"\n\nDavid ignored him. \"Fly, Phoenix!\" he cried, and he pushed the bird\ntoward the edge.\n\nUnderstanding dawned in the amber eyes at last. The bird, with one\nclear, defiant cry, leaped to an out-jutting boulder. The golden wings\nspread, the golden neck curved back, the golden talons pushed against\nthe rock. The bird launched itself into the air and soared out over\nthe valley, sparkling, flashing, shimmering; a flame, large as a\nsunburst, a meteor, a diamond, a star, diminishing at last to a speck\nof gold dust, which glimmered twice in the distance before it was gone\naltogether.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n_The Author_\n\nEdward Ormondroyd\n\n\nWhen Edward Ormondroyd was about thirteen, his family moved from\nPennsylvania to Ann Arbor, Michigan. He and a friend began to read\nArthur Ransome's boating stories and, inspired by the adventures of\nthe Swallows, built their own fourteen-foot sailboat and tried to\nre-create that English magic on the Huron River.\n\nIn 1943 he graduated from high school and joined the Navy. Destroyer\nEscort 419 was his home for the next two years. \"When the war was\nover, she looked in on China and Korea, and came home. She did show me\nSan Francisco Bay at dusk. One look convinced me that I would like to\nlive by it; and I have, ever since.\"\n\nAfter the war, Mr. Ormondroyd went to the University of California at\nBerkeley. He graduated in 1951, and since then has been busy writing,\nsailing as able seaman aboard a tanker, and working as a bookstore\nclerk and machine tender. He lives in Berkeley, California. He is\nmarried and has one son.\n\nIt was while Mr. Ormondroyd was at college that David and the Phoenix\nfirst intruded into his consciousness. \"_One day, when I was walking\nacross campus, I had a sudden vision of a large and pompous bird\ndiving out of a window, tripping on the sill, and falling into a rose\narbor below. I had to explain to myself why the poor bird was in such\na situation in the first place, and what became of it afterwards. The\nresult of my investigation was_ DAVID AND THE PHOENIX.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nDavid and\n\nthe Phoenix\n\n\nEdward Ormondroyd\n\n_Illustrated by Joan Raysor_\n\n\nDavid knew that one should be prepared for anything when one climbs a\nmountain, but he never dreamed what he would find that June morning on\nthe mountain ledge.\n\nThere stood an enormous bird, with a head like an eagle, a neck like a\nswan, and a scarlet crest. The most astonishing thing was that the\nbird had an open book on the ground and was reading from it!\n\nThis was David's first sight of the fabulous Phoenix and the beginning\nof a pleasant and profitable partnership. The Phoenix found a great\ndeal lacking in David's education--he flunked questions like \"How do\nyou tell a true from a false Unicorn?\"--and undertook to supplement it\nwith a practical education, an education that would be a preparation\nfor Life. The education had to be combined with offensive and\ndefensive measures against a Scientist who was bent on capturing the\nPhoenix, but the two projects together involved exciting and hilarious\nadventures for boy and bird.\n\nA wonderful read-aloud book, adventurous and very funny, with much of\nthe magic as well as the humor of the fantastic.\n\n_Follett Publishing Company_\n\n_New York_   CHICAGO   _Toronto_\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's David and the Phoenix, by Edward Ormondroyd\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK DAVID AND THE PHOENIX ***\n\n***** This file should be named 27922-8.txt or 27922-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/2\/7\/9\/2\/27922\/\n\nProduced by Sankar Viswanathan, Greg Weeks, and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http:\/\/www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":272,"split":"train"}
