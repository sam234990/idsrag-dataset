The Lady becomes fatigued, and the brothers wander off in search of sustenance.\nWhile alone, she encounters the debauched Comus, a character inspired by the god of revelry (Ancient Greek: \u039a\u1ff6\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2), who is disguised as a villager and claims he will lead her to her brothers. Deceived by his amiable countenance, the Lady follows him, only to be captured, brought to his pleasure palace and victimised by his necromancy. Seated on an enchanted chair, with \"gums of glutinous heat\", she is immobilised, and Comus accosts her while with one hand he holds a necromancer's wand and with the other he offers a vessel with a drink that would overpower her. Comus urges the Lady to \"be not coy\" and drink from his magical cup (representing sexual pleasure and intemperance), but she repeatedly refuses, arguing for the virtuousness of temperance and chastity. Within view at his palace is an array of cuisine intended to arouse the Lady's appetites and desires. Despite being restrained against her will, she continues to exercise right reason (recta ratio) in her disputation with Comus, thereby manifesting her freedom of mind. Whereas the would-be seducer argues appetites and desires issuing from one's nature are \"natural\" and therefore licit, the Lady contends that only rational self-control is enlightened and virtuous. To be self-indulgent and intemperate, she adds, is to forfeit one's higher nature and to yield to baser impulses. In this debate the Lady and Comus signify, respectively, soul and body, ratio and libido, sublimation and sensuality, virtue and vice, moral rectitude and immoral depravity. In line with the theme of the journey that distinguishes Comus, the Lady has been deceived by the guile of a treacherous character, temporarily waylaid, and besieged by sophistry that is disguised as wisdom.\nMeanwhile, her brothers, searching for her, come across the Attendant Spirit, an angelic figure sent to aid them, who takes the form of a shepherd and tells them how to defeat Comus. As the Lady continues to assert her freedom of mind and to exercise her free will by resistance and even defiance, she is rescued by the Attendant Spirit along with her brothers, who chase off Comus. The Lady remains magically bound to her chair. With a song, the Spirit conjures the water nymph Sabrina who frees the Lady on account of her steadfast virtue. She and her brothers are reunited with their parents in a triumphal celebration, which signifies the heavenly bliss awaiting the wayfaring soul that prevails over trials and travails, whether these are the threats posed by overt evil or the blandishments of temptation.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Milton's Comus, by John Milton\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Milton\nhimself describes it simply as \"A Mask\"; by others it has been\ncriticised and estimated as a lyrical drama, a drama in the epic style,\na lyric poem in the _form_ of a play, a phantasy, an allegory, a\nphilosophical poem, a suite of speeches or majestic soliloquies, and\neven a didactic poem. Such variety in the description of the poem is\nexplained partly by its complex charm and many-sided interest, and\npartly by the desire to describe it from that point of view which should\nbest reconcile its literary form with what we know of the genius and\npowers of its author. Those who, like Dr. Johnson, have blamed it as a\ndrama, have admired it \"as a series of lines,\" or as a lyric; one\nwriter, who has found that its characters are nothing, its sentiments\ntedious, its story uninteresting, has nevertheless \"doubted whether\nthere will ever be any similar poem which gives so true a conception of\nthe capacity and the dignity of the mind by which it was produced\"\n(Bagehot's _Literary Studies_). Some who have praised it as an allegory\nsee in it a satire on the evils both of the Church and of the State,\nwhile others regard it as alluding to the vices of the Court alone. Some\nhave found its lyrical parts the best, while others, charmed with its\n\"divine philosophy,\" have commended those deep conceits which place it\nalongside of the _Faerie Queen_, as shadowing forth an episode in the\neducation of a noble soul and as a poet's lesson against intemperance\nand impurity. But no one can refuse to admit that, more than any other\nof Milton's shorter poems, it gives us an insight into the peculiar\ngenius and character of its author: it was, in the opinion of Hallam,\n\"sufficient to convince any one of taste and feeling that a great poet\nhad arisen in England, and one partly formed in a different school from\nhis contemporaries.\" It is true that in the early poems we do not find\nthe whole of Milton, for he had yet to pass through many years of\ntrouble and controversy; but _Comus_, in a special degree, reveals or\nforeshadows much of the Milton of _Paradise Lost_. Whether we regard its\nplace in Milton's life, in the series of his works, or in English\nliterature as a whole, the poem is full of significance: it is worth\nwhile, therefore, to consider how its form was determined by the\nexternal circumstances and previous training of the poet; by his\nfavourite studies in poetry, philosophy, history, and music; and by his\nnoble theory of life in general, and of a poet's life in particular.\n\nThe mask was represented at Ludlow Castle on September 29th, 1634; it\nwas probably composed early in that year. It belongs, therefore, to that\ngroup of poems (_L'Allegro_, _Il Penseroso_, _Arcades_, _Comus_, and\n_Lycidas_) written by Milton while living in his father's house at\nHorton, near Windsor, after having left the University of Cambridge in\nJuly, 1632. As he was born in 1608, he would be twenty-five years of age\nwhen this poem was composed. During his stay at Horton (1632-39), which\nwas broken only by a journey to Italy in 1638-9, he was chiefly occupied\nwith the study of the Greek, Roman, Italian, and English literatures,\neach of which has left its impress on _Comus_. He read widely and\ncarefully, and it has been said that his great and original imagination\nwas almost entirely nourished, or at least stimulated, by books: his\nresidence at Horton was, accordingly, pre-eminently what he intended it\nto be, and what his father wisely and gladly permitted it to be--a time\nof preparation and ripening for the work to which he had dedicated\nhimself. We are reminded of his own words in _Comus_:\n\n                    And Wisdom's self\n    Oft seeks to sweet retired solitude,\n    Where, with her best nurse, Contemplation,\n    She plumes her feathers, and lets grow her wings,\n    That, in the various bustle of resort,\n    Were all to-ruffled, and sometimes impaired.\n\nWe find in _Comus_ abundant reminiscences of Milton's study of the\nliterature of antiquity. \"It would not be too much to say that the\nliterature of antiquity was to Milton's genius what soil and light are\nto a plant. It nourished, it coloured, it developed it. It determined\nnot merely his character as an artist, but it exercised an influence on\nhis intellect and temper scarcely less powerful than hereditary\ninstincts and contemporary history. It at once animated and chastened\nhis imagination; it modified his fancy; it furnished him with his\nmodels. On it his taste was formed; on it his style was moulded. From it\nhis diction and his method derived their peculiarities. It transformed\nwhat would in all probability have been the mere counterpart of\nCaedmon's Paraphrase or Langland's Vision into Paradise Lost; and what\nwould have been the mere counterpart of Corydon's Doleful Knell and the\nsatire of the Three Estates, into Lycidas and Comus.\" (_Quarterly\nReview_, No. 326.)\n\nBut Milton has also told us that Spenser was his master, and the full\ncharm of _Comus_ cannot be realised without reference to the artistic\nand philosophical spirit of the author of the _Faerie Queene_. Both\npoems deal with the war between the body and the soul--between the lower\nand the higher nature. In an essay on 'Spenser as a philosophic poet,'\nDe Vere says: \"The perils and degradations of an animalised life are\nshown under the allegory of Sir Guyon's sea voyage with its successive\nstorms and whirlpools, its 'rock of Reproach' strewn with wrecks and\ndead men's bones, its 'wandering islands,' its 'quicksands of\nUnthriftihead,' its 'whirlepoole of Decay,' its 'sea-monsters,' and\nlastly, its 'bower of Bliss,' and the doom which overtakes it, together\nwith the deliverance of Acrasia's victims, transformed by that witch's\nspells into beasts. Still more powerful is the allegory of worldly\nambition, illustrated under the name of 'the cave of Mammon.' The Legend\nof Holiness delineates with not less insight those enemies which wage\nwar upon the spiritual life.\" All this Milton had studied in the _Faerie\nQueene_, and had understood it; and, like Sir Guyon, he felt himself to\nbe a knight enrolled under the banner of Parity and Self-Control. So\nthat, in _Comus_, we find the sovereign value of Temperance or\nSelf-Regulation--what the Greeks called \u00cf\u0083\u00cf\u0089\u00cf\u0086\u00cf\u0081\u00ce\u00bf\u00cf\u0083\u00e1\u00bd\u00bb\u00ce\u00bd\u00ce\u00b7--set forth\nno less clearly than in Spenser's poem: in Milton's mask it becomes\nalmost identical with Virtue itself. The enchantments of Acrasia in her\nBower of Bliss become the spells of Comus; the armour of Belphoebe\nbecomes the \"complete steel\" of Chastity; while the supremacy of\nConscience, the bounty of Nature and man's ingratitude, the unloveliness\nof Mammon and of Excess, the blossom of Courtesy oft found on lowly\nstalk, and the final triumph of Virtue through striving and temptation,\nall are dwelt upon.\n\n    It is the mind that maketh good or ill,\n    That maketh wretch or happie, rich or poore:\n\nso speaks Spenser; and Milton similarly--\n\n    He that has light within his own clear breast\n    May sit i' the centre, and enjoy bright day:\n    But he that hides a dark soul and foul thoughts\n    Benighted walks under the mid-day sun;\n    Himself is his own dungeon.\n\nIn endeavouring still further to trace, by means of verbal or structural\nresemblances, the sources from which Milton drew his materials for\n_Comus_, critics have referred to Peele's _Old Wives' Tale_ (1595); to\nFletcher's pastoral, _The Faithful Shepherdess_, of which Charles Lamb\nhas said that if all its parts 'had been in unison with its many\ninnocent scenes and sweet lyric intermixtures, it had been a poem fit to\nvie with _Comus_ or the _Arcadia_, to have been put into the hands of\nboys and virgins, to have made matter for young dreams, like the loves\nof Hermia and Lysander'; to Ben Jonson's mask of _Pleasure reconciled to\nVirtue_ (1619), in which Comus is \"the god of cheer, or the Belly\"; and\nto the _Comus_ of Erycius Puteanus (Henri du Puy), Professor of\nEloquence at Louvain. It is true that Fletcher's pastoral was being\nacted in London about the time Milton was writing his _Comus_, that the\npoem by the Dutch Professor was republished at Oxford in 1634, and that\nresemblances are evident between Milton's poem and those named. But\nProfessor Masson does well in warning us that \"infinitely too much has\nbeen made of such coincidences. After all of them, even the most ideal\nand poetical, the feeling in reading _Comus_ is that all here is\ndifferent, all peculiar.\" Whatever Milton borrowed, he borrowed, as he\nsays himself, in order to better it.\n\nIt is interesting to consider the mutual relations of the poems written\nby Milton at Horton. Everything that Milton wrote is Miltonic; he had\nwhat has been called the power of transforming everything into himself,\nand these poems are, accordingly, evidences of the development of\nMilton's opinions and of his secret purpose. It has been said that\n_L'Allegro_ and _Il Penseroso_ are to be regarded as \"the pleadings, the\ndecision on which is in Comus\"--_L'Allegro_ representing the Cavalier,\nand _Il Penseroso_ the Puritan element. This is true only in a limited\nsense. It is true that the Puritan element in the Horton series of poems\nbecomes more patent as we pass from the two lyrics to the mask of\n_Comus_, and from _Comus_ to the elegy of _Lycidas_, just as, in the\ncorresponding periods of time, the evils connected with the reign of\nCharles I. and with Laud's crusade against Puritanism were becoming more\npronounced. But we can hardly regard Milton as having expressed any new\ndecision in _Comus_: the decision is already made when \"vain deluding\nJoys\" are banished in _Il Penseroso_, and \"loathed Melancholy\" in\n_L'Allegro_. The mask is an expansion and exaltation of the delights of\nthe contemplative man, but there is still a place for the \"unreproved\npleasures\" of the cheerful man. Unless it were so, _Comus_ could not\nhave been written; there would have been no \"sunshine holiday\" for the\nrustics and no \"victorious dance\" for the gentle lady and her brothers.\nBut in _Comus_ we realise the mutual relation of _L'Allegro_ and _Il\nPenseroso_; we see their application to the joys and sorrows of the\nactual life of individuals; we observe human nature in contact with the\n\"hard assays\" of life. And, subsequently, in _Lycidas_ we are made to\nrealise that this human nature is Milton's own, and to understand how it\nwas that his Puritanism which, three years before, had permitted him to\nwrite a cavalier mask, should, three years after, lead him from the\nfresh fields of poetry into the barren plains of controversial prose.\n\nThe Mask was a favourite form of entertainment in England in Milton's\nyouth, and had been so from the time of Henry VIII., in whose reign\nelaborate masked shows, introduced from Italy, first became popular. But\nthey seem to have found their way into England, in a crude form, even\nearlier; and we read of court disguisings in the reign of Edward III. It\nis usually said that the Mask derives its name from the fact that the\nactors wore masks, and in Hall's Chronicle we read that, in 1512, \"on\nthe day of Epiphany at night, the king, with eleven others, was\ndisguised after the manner of Italy, called a Mask, a thing not seen\nbefore in England; they were appareled in garments long and broad,\nwrought all with gold, with _visors_ and caps of gold.\" The truth,\nhowever, seems to be that the use of a visor was not essential in such\nentertainments, which, from the first, were called 'masks,' the word\n'masker' being used sometimes of the players, and sometimes of their\ndisguises. The word has come to us, through the French form _masque_,\ncognate with Spanish _mascarada_, a masquerade or assembly of maskers,\notherwise called a mummery. Up to the time of Henry VIII. these\nentertainments were of the nature of dumb-show or _tableaux vivants_,\nand delighted the spectators chiefly by the splendour of the costumes\nand machinery employed in their representation; but, afterwards, the\nchief actors spoke their parts, singing and dancing were introduced, and\nthe composition of masks for royal and other courtly patrons became an\noccupation worthy of a poet. They were frequently combined with other\nforms of amusement, all of which were, in the case of the Court, placed\nunder the management of a Master of Revels, whose official title was\nMagister Jocorum, Revellorum et _Mascorum_; in the first printed English\ntragedy, _Gorboduc_ (1565), each act opens with what is called a\ndumb-show or mask. But the more elaborate form of the Mask soon grew to\nbe an entertainment complete in itself, and the demand for such became\nso great in the time of James I. and Charles I. that the history of\nthese reigns might almost be traced in the succession of masks then\nwritten. Ben Jonson, who thoroughly established the Mask in English\nliterature, wrote many Court Masks, and made them a vehicle less for the\ndisplay of 'painting and carpentry' than for the expression of the\nintellectual and social life of his time. His masks are excelled only\nby _Comus_, and possess in a high degree that 'Doric delicacy' in their\nsongs and odes which Sir Henry Wotton found so ravishing in Milton's\nmask. Jonson, in his lifetime, declared that, next himself, only\nFletcher and Chapman could write a mask; and apart from the compositions\nof these writers and of William Browne (_Inner Temple Masque_), there\nare few specimens worthy to be named along with Jonson's until we come\nto Milton's _Arcades_. Other mask-writers were Middleton, Dekker,\nShirley, Carew, and Davenant; and it is interesting to note that in\nCarew's _Coelum Brittanicum_ (1633-4), for which Lawes composed the\nmusic, the two boys who afterwards acted in _Comus_ had juvenile parts.\nIt has been pointed out that the popularity of the Mask in Milton's\nyouth received a stimulus from the Puritan hatred of the theatre which\nfound expression at that time, and drove non-Puritans to welcome the\nMask as a protest against that spirit which saw nothing but evil in\nevery form of dramatic entertainment. Milton, who enjoyed the\ntheatre--both \"Jonson's learned sock\" and what \"ennobled hath the\nbuskined stage\"--was led, through his friendship with the musician\nLawes, to compose a mask to celebrate the entry of the Earl of\nBridgewater upon his office of \"Lord President of the Council in the\nPrincipality of Wales and the Marches of the same.\" He had already\nwritten, also at the request of Lawes, a mask, or portion of a mask,\ncalled _Arcades_, and the success of this may have stimulated him to\nhigher effort. The result was _Comus_, in which the Mask reached its\nhighest level, and after which it practically faded out of our\nliterature.\n\nMilton's two masks, _Arcades_ and _Comus_, were written for members of\nthe same noble family, the former in honour of the Countess Dowager of\nDerby, and the latter in honour of John, first Earl of Bridgewater, who\nwas both her stepson and son-in-law. This two-fold relation arose from\nthe fact that the Earl was the son of Viscount Brackley, the Countess's\nsecond husband, and had himself married Lady Frances Stanley, a daughter\nof the Countess by her first husband, the fifth Earl of Derby. Amongst\nthe children of the Earl of Bridgewater were three who took important\nparts in the representation of _Comus_--Alice, the youngest daughter,\nthen about fourteen years of age, who appeared as _The Lady_; John,\nViscount Brackley, who took the part of the _Elder Brother_, and Thomas\nEgerton, who appeared as the _Second Brother_. We do not know who acted\nthe parts of _Comus_ and _Sabrina_, but the part of the _Attendant\nSpirit_ was taken by Henry Lawes, \"gentleman of the Chapel Royal, and\none of His Majesty's private musicians.\" The Earl's children were his\npupils, and the mask was naturally produced under his direction.\nMilton's friendship with Lawes is shown by the sonnet which the poet\naddressed to the musician:\n\n    Harry, whose tuneful and well measur'd song\n      First taught our English music how to span\n      Words with just note and accent, not to scan\n      With Midas' ears, committing short and long;\n    Thy worth and skill exempts thee from the throng,\n      With praise enough for Envy to look wan;\n      To after age thou shalt be writ the man,\n    That with smooth air could'st humour best our tongue.\n    Thou honour'st Verse, and Verse must lend her wing\n      To honour thee, the priest of Phoebus' quire,\n      That tun'st their happiest lines in hymn, or story.\n    Dante shall give Fame leave to set thee higher\n      Than his Casella, who he woo'd to sing,\n      Met in the milder shades of Purgatory.\n\nWe must remember also that it was to Lawes that Milton's _Comus_ owed\nits first publication, and, as we see from the dedication prefixed to\nthe text, that he was justly proud of his share in its first\nrepresentation.\n\nSuch were the persons who appeared in Milton's mask; they are few in\nnumber, and the plan of the piece is correspondingly simple. There are\nthree scenes which may be briefly characterised thus:\n\n    I. The Tempter and the Tempted: lines 1-658.\n       _Scene_: A wild wood.\n\n   II. The Temptation and the Rescue: lines 659-958.\n       _Scene_: The Palace of Comus.\n\n  III. The Triumph: lines 959-1023.\n       _Scene_: The President's Castle.\n\nIn the first scene, after a kind of prologue (lines 1-92), the interest\nrises as we are introduced first to Comus and his rout, then to the Lady\nalone and \"night-foundered,\" and finally to Comus and the Lady in\ncompany. At the same time the nature of the Lady's trial and her\nsubsequent victory are foreshadowed in a conversation between the\nbrothers and the attendant Spirit. This is one of the more Miltonic\nparts of the mask: in the philosophical reasoning of the elder brother,\nas opposed to the matter-of-fact arguments of the younger, we trace the\nyoung poet fresh from the study of the divine volume of Plato, and\nfilled with a noble trust in God. In the second scene we breathe the\nunhallowed air of the abode of the wily tempter, who endeavours, \"under\nfair pretence of friendly ends,\" to wind himself into the pure heart of\nthe Lady. But his \"gay rhetoric\" is futile against the \"sun-clad power\nof chastity\"; and he is driven off the scene by the two brothers, who\nare led and instructed by the Spirit disguised as the shepherd Thyrsis.\nBut the Lady, having been lured into the haunt of impurity, is left\nspell-bound, and appeal is made to the pure nymph Sabrina, who is \"swift\nto aid a virgin, such as was herself, in hard-besetting need.\" It is in\nthe contention between Comus and the Lady in this scene that the\ninterest of the mask may be said to culminate, for here its purpose\nstands revealed: \"it is a song to Temperance as the ground of Freedom,\nto temperance as the guard of all the virtues, to beauty as secured by\ntemperance, and its central point and climax is in the pleading of these\nmotives by the Lady against their opposites in the mouth of the Lord of\nsensual Revel.\" _Milton: Classical Writers_. In the third scene the Lady\nAlice and her brothers are presented by the Spirit to their noble father\nand mother as triumphing \"in victorious dance o'er sensual folly and\nintemperance.\" The Spirit then speaks the epilogue, calling upon mortals\nwho love true freedom to strive after virtue:\n\n    Love Virtue; she alone is free.\n    She can teach ye how to climb\n    Higher than the sphery chime;\n    Or, if Virtue feeble were,\n    Heaven itself would stoop to her.\n\nThe last couplet Milton afterwards, on his Italian journey, entered in\nan album belonging to an Italian named Cerdogni, and underneath it the\nwords, _Coelum non animum muto dum trans mare curro_, and his\nsignature, Joannes Miltonius, Anglus. The juxtaposition of these verses\nis significant: though he had left his own land Milton had not become\nwhat, fifty or sixty years before, Roger Ascham had condemned as an\n\"Italianated Englishman.\" He was one of those \"worthy Gentlemen of\nEngland, whom all the Siren tongues of Italy could never untwine from\nthe mast of God's word; nor no enchantment of vanity overturn them from\nthe fear of God and love of honesty\" (Ascham's _Scholemaster_). And one\nmight almost infer that Milton, in his account of the sovereign plant\nHaemony which was to foil the wiles of _Comus_, had remembered not only\nHomer's description of the root Moly \"that Hermes once to wise Ulysses\ngave,\"{16:A} but also Ascham's remarks thereupon: \"The true medicine\nagainst the enchantments of Circe, the vanity of licentious pleasure,\nthe enticements of all sin, is, in Homer, the herb Moly, with the black\nroot and white flower, sour at first, but sweet in the end; which Hesiod\ntermeth the study of Virtue, hard and irksome in the beginning, but in\nthe end easy and pleasant. And that which is most to be marvelled at,\nthe divine poet Homer saith plainly that this medicine against sin and\nvanity is not found out by man, but given and taught by God.\" Milton's\n_Comus_, like his last great poems, is a poetical expression of the same\nbelief. \"His poetical works, the outcome of his inner life, his life of\nartistic contemplation, are,\" in the words of Prof. Dowden, \"various\nrenderings of one dominant idea--that the struggle for mastery between\ngood and evil is the prime fact of life; and that a final victory of the\nrighteous cause is assured by the existence of a divine order of the\nuniverse, which Milton knew by the name of 'Providence.'\"\n\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n{16:A} It is noteworthy that Lamb, whose allusiveness is remarkable,\nemploys in his account of the plant Moly almost the exact words of\nMilton's description of Haemony; compare the following extract from _The\nAdventures of Ulysses_ with lines 629-640 of _Comus_: \"The flower of the\nherb Moly, which is sovereign against enchantments: the moly is a small\nunsightly root, its virtues but little known, and in low estimation; the\ndull shepherd treads on it every day with his clouted shoes, but it\nbears a small white flower, which is medicinal against charms, blights,\nmildews, and damps.\"\n\n\n\n\n  COMUS.\n\n\n  A MASK\n\n  PRESENTED AT LUDLOW CASTLE, 1634.\n\n  BEFORE\n\n  JOHN, EARL OF BRIDGEWATER,\n\n  THEN PRESIDENT OF WALES.\n\n\n\n\n_The Copy of a Letter written by Sir Henry Wotton to the Author upon the\nfollowing Poem._\n\n\nFrom the College, this 13 of April, 1638.\n\nSIR,\n\nIt was a special favour, when you lately bestowed upon me here the first\ntaste of your acquaintance, though no longer than to make me know that I\nwanted more time to value it, and to enjoy it rightly; and, in truth, if\nI could then have imagined your farther stay in these parts, which I\nunderstood afterwards by Mr. H., I would have been bold, in our vulgar\nphrase, to mend my draught (for you left me with an extreme thirst), and\nto have begged your conversation again, jointly with your said learned\nfriend, at a poor meal or two, that we might have banded together some\ngood authors of the antient time; among which I observed you to have\nbeen familiar.\n\nSince your going, you have charged me with new obligations, both for a\nvery kind letter from you dated the sixth of this month, and for a\ndainty piece of entertainment which came therewith. Wherein I should\nmuch commend the tragical part, if the lyrical did not ravish me with a\ncertain Doric delicacy in your songs and odes, whereunto I must plainly\nconfess to have seen yet nothing parallel in our language: _Ipsa\nmollities_.{19:A} But I must not omit to tell you, that I now only owe\nyou thanks for intimating unto me (how modestly soever) the true\nartificer. For the work itself I had viewed some good while before, with\nsingular delight, having received it from our common friend Mr. R. in\nthe very close of the late R.'s poems, printed at Oxford; whereunto it\nis added (as I now suppose) that the accessory might help out the\nprincipal, according to the art of stationers, and to leave the reader\n_con la bocca dolce_.{20:A}\n\nNow, Sir, concerning your travels, wherein I may challenge a little more\nprivilege of discourse with you; I suppose you will not blanch{20:B}\nParis in your way; therefore I have been bold to trouble you with a few\nlines to Mr. M. B., whom you shall easily find attending the young Lord\nS. as his governor, and you may surely receive from him good directions\nfor shaping of your farther journey into Italy, where he did reside by\nmy choice some time for the king, after mine own recess from Venice.\n\nI should think that your best line will be through the whole length of\nFrance to Marseilles, and thence by sea to Genoa, whence the passage\ninto Tuscany is as diurnal as a Gravesend barge. I hasten, as you do, to\nFlorence, or Siena, the rather to tell you a short story, from the\ninterest you have given me in your safety.\n\nAt Siena I was tabled in the house of one Alberto Scipione, an old Roman\ncourtier in dangerous times, having been steward to the Duca di\nPagliano, who with all his family were strangled, save this only man,\nthat escaped by foresight of the tempest. With him I had often much chat\nof those affairs; into which he took pleasure to look back from his\nnative harbour; and at my departure toward Rome (which had been the\ncentre of his experience) I had won confidence enough to beg his advice,\nhow I might carry myself securely there, without offence of others, or\nof mine own conscience. _Signor Arrigo mio_ (says he), _I pensieri\nstretti, ed il viso sciolto_,{21:A} will go safely over the whole world.\nOf which Delphian oracle (for so I have found it) your judgment doth\nneed no commentary; and therefore, Sir, I will commit you with it to the\nbest of all securities, God's dear love, remaining\n\n                                         Your friend as much to command\n                                         as any of longer date,\n\n                                         HENRY WOTTON.\n\n_Postscript._\n\nSir,--I have expressly sent this my footboy to prevent your departure\nwithout some acknowledgment from me of the receipt of your obliging\nletter, having myself through some business, I know not how, neglected\nthe ordinary conveyance. In any part where I shall understand you fixed,\nI shall be glad and diligent to entertain you with home-novelties, even\nfor some fomentation of our friendship, too soon interrupted in the\ncradle.{21:B}\n\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n{19:A} It is delicacy itself.\n\n{20:A} With a sweet taste in his mouth (so that he may desire more).\n\n{20:B} Avoid.\n\n{21:A} \"Thoughts close, countenance open.\"\n\n{21:B} This letter was printed in the edition of 1645, but omitted in\nthat of 1673. It was written by Sir Henry Wotton, Provost of Eton\nCollege, just in time to overtake Milton before he set out on his\njourney to Italy. As a parting act of courtesy Milton had sent Sir Henry\na letter with a copy of Lawes's edition of his _Comus_, and the above\nletter is an acknowledgment of the favour.\n\n\n\n\nTO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE{22:A}\n\nJOHN, LORD VISCOUNT BRACKLEY,\n\n_Son and Heir-Apparent to the Earl of Bridgewater, etc._\n\n\nMY LORD,\n\nThis Poem, which received its first occasion of birth from yourself and\nothers of your noble family, and much honour from your own person in the\nperformance, now returns again to make a final Dedication of itself to\nyou. Although not openly acknowledged by the Author, yet it is a\nlegitimate offspring, so lovely and so much desired that the often\ncopying of it hath tired my pen to give my several friends satisfaction,\nand brought me to a necessity of producing it to the public view; and\nnow to offer it up, in all rightful devotion, to those fair hopes and\nrare endowments of your much-promising youth, which give a full\nassurance to all that know you, of a future excellence. Live, sweet\nLord, to be the honour of your name, and receive this as your own, from\nthe hands of him who hath by many favours been long obliged to your most\nhonoured Parents, and as in this representation your attendant\n_Thyrsis_,{22:B} so now in all real expression,\n\n                                Your faithful and most humble Servant,\n\n                                H.

Neptune, besides the sway\n    Of every salt flood and each ebbing stream,\n    Took in by lot, 'twixt high and nether Jove,                      20\n    Imperial rule of all the sea-girt isles\n    That, like to rich and various gems, inlay\n    The unadorn\u00c3\u00a9d bosom of the deep;\n    Which he, to grace his tributary gods,\n    By course commits to several government,\n    And gives them leave to wear their sapphire crowns\n    And wield their little tridents. But this Isle,\n    The greatest and the best of all the main,\n    He quarters to his blue-haired deities;\n    And all this tract that fronts the falling sun                    30\n    A noble Peer of mickle trust and power\n    Has in his charge, with tempered awe to guide\n    An old and haughty nation, proud in arms:\n    Where his fair offspring, nursed in princely lore,\n    Are coming to attend their father's state,\n    And new-intrusted sceptre. But their way\n    Lies through the perplexed paths of this drear wood,\n    The nodding horror of whose shady brows\n    Threats the forlorn and wandering passenger;\n    And here their tender age might suffer peril,                     40\n    But that, by quick command from sovran Jove,\n    I was despatched for their defence and guard:\n    And listen why; for I will tell you now\n    What never yet was heard in tale or song,\n    From old or modern bard, in hall or bower.\n      Bacchus, that first from out the purple grape\n    Crushed the sweet poison of misus\u00c3\u00a9d wine,\n    After the Tuscan mariners transformed,\n    Coasting the Tyrrhene shore, as the winds listed,\n    On Circe's island fell: (who knows not Circe,                     50\n    The daughter of the Sun, whose charm\u00c3\u00a8d cup\n    Whoever tasted lost his upright shape,\n    And downward fell into a grovelling swine?)\n    This Nymph, that gazed upon his clustering locks,\n    With ivy berries wreathed, and his blithe youth,\n    Had by him, ere he parted thence, a son\n    Much like his father, but his mother more,\n    Whom therefore she brought up, and Comus named:\n    Who, ripe and frolic of his full-grown age,\n    Roving the Celtic and Iberian fields,                             60\n    At last betakes him to this ominous wood,\n    And, in thick shelter of black shades imbowered,\n    Excels his mother at her mighty art;\n    Offering to every weary traveller\n    His orient liquor in a crystal glass,\n    To quench the drouth of Ph\u00c5\u0093bus; which as they taste\n    (For most do taste through fond intemperate thirst),\n    Soon as the potion works, their human count'nance,\n    The express resemblance of the gods, is changed\n    Into some brutish form of wolf or bear,                           70\n    Or ounce or tiger, hog, or bearded goat,\n    All other parts remaining as they were.\n    And they, so perfect is their misery,\n    Not once perceive their foul disfigurement,\n    But boast themselves more comely than before,\n    And all their friends and native home forget,\n    To roll with pleasure in a sensual sty.\n    Therefore, when any favoured of high Jove\n    Chances to pass through this adventurous glade,\n    Swift as the sparkle of a glancing star                           80\n    I shoot from heaven, to give him safe convoy,\n    As now I do. But first I must put off\n    These my sky-robes, spun out of Iris' woof,\n    And take the weeds and likeness of a swain\n    That to the service of this house belongs,\n    Who, with his soft pipe and smooth-dittied song,\n    Well knows to still the wild winds when they roar,\n    And hush the waving woods; nor of less faith,\n    And in this office of his mountain watch\n    Likeliest, and nearest to the present aid                         90\n    Of this occasion. But I hear the tread\n    Of hateful steps; I must be viewless now.\n\n_COMUS enters, with a charming-rod in one hand, his glass in the other;\nwith him a rout of monsters, headed like sundry sorts of wild beasts,\nbut otherwise like men and women, their apparel glistering.

Now to my charms,                      150\n    And to my wily trains: I shall ere long\n    Be well stocked with as fair a herd as grazed\n    About my mother Circe. Thus I hurl\n    My dazzling spells into the spongy air,\n    Of power to cheat the eye with blear illusion,\n    And give it false presentments, lest the place\n    And my quaint habits breed astonishment,\n    And put the damsel to suspicious flight;\n    Which must not be, for that's against my course.\n    I, under fair pretence of friendly ends,                         160\n    And well-placed words of glozing courtesy,\n    Baited with reasons not unplausible,\n    Wind me into the easy-hearted man,\n    And hug him into snares. When once her eye\n    Hath met the virtue of this magic dust,\n    I shall appear some harmless villager\n    Whom thrift keeps up about his country gear.\n    But here she comes; I fairly step aside,\n    And hearken, if I may, her business here.\n\n_The LADY enters._\n\n    _Lady._ This way the noise was, if mine ear be true,\n    My best guide now. Methought it was the sound\n    Of riot and ill-managed merriment,                               172\n    Such as the jocund flute or gamesome pipe\n    Stirs up among the loose unlettered hinds,\n    When, for their teeming flocks and granges full,\n    In wanton dance they praise the bounteous Pan,\n    And thank the gods amiss. I should be loth\n    To meet the rudeness and swilled insolence\n    Of such late wassailers; yet, oh! where else\n    Shall I inform my unacquainted feet                              180\n    In the blind mazes of this tangled wood?\n    My brothers, when they saw me wearied out\n    With this long way, resolving here to lodge\n    Under the spreading favour of these pines,\n    Stepped, as they said, to the next thicket-side\n    To bring me berries, or such cooling fruit\n    As the kind hospitable woods provide.\n    They left me then when the grey-hooded Even,\n    Like a sad votarist in palmer's weed,\n    Rose from the hindmost wheels of Ph\u00c5\u0093bus' wain.                   190\n    But where they are, and why they came not back,\n    Is now the labour of my thoughts. 'Tis likeliest\n    They had engaged their wandering steps too far;\n    And envious darkness, ere they could return,\n    Had stole them from me. Else, O thievish Night,\n    Why shouldst thou, but for some felonious end,\n    In thy dark lantern thus close up the stars\n    That Nature hung in heaven, and filled their lamps\n    With everlasting oil to give due light\n    To the misled and lonely traveller?                              200\n    This is the place, as well as I may guess,\n    Whence even now the tumult of loud mirth\n    Was rife, and perfect in my listening ear;\n    Yet nought but single darkness do I find.\n    What might this be? A thousand fantasies\n    Begin to throng into my memory,\n    Of calling shapes, and beckoning shadows dire,\n    And airy tongues that syllable men's names\n    On sands and shores and desert wildernesses.\n    These thoughts may startle well, but not astound                 210\n    The virtuous mind, that ever walks attended\n    By a strong siding champion, Conscience.\n    O, welcome, pure-eyed Faith, white-handed Hope,\n    Thou hovering angel girt with golden wings,\n    And thou unblemished form of Chastity!\n    I see ye visibly, and now believe\n    That He, the Supreme Good, to whom all things ill\n    Are but as slavish officers of vengeance,\n    Would send a glistering guardian, if need were,\n    To keep my life and honour unassailed....                        220\n    Was I deceived, or did a sable cloud\n    Turn forth her silver lining on the night?\n    I did not err: there does a sable cloud\n    Turn forth her silver lining on the night,\n    And casts a gleam over this tufted grove.\n    I cannot hallo to my brothers, but\n    Such noise as I can make to be heard farthest\n    I'll venture; for my new-enlivened spirits\n    Prompt me, and they perhaps are not far off.\n\n_Song._\n\n    Sweet Echo, sweetest nymph, that liv'st unseen                   230\n          Within thy airy shell\n        By slow Meander's margent green,\n    And in the violet-embroidered vale\n        Where the love-lorn nightingale\n    Nightly to thee her sad song mourneth well:\n    Canst thou not tell me of a gentle pair\n        That likest thy Narcissus are?\n          O, if thou have\n        Hid them in some flowery cave,\n          Tell me but where,                                         240\n      Sweet Queen of Parley, Daughter of the Sphere!\n      So may'st thou be translated to the skies,\n    And give resounding grace to all Heaven's harmonies!\n\n    _Comus._ Can any mortal mixture of earth's mould\n    Breathe such divine enchanting ravishment?\n    Sure something holy lodges in that breast,\n    And with these raptures moves the vocal air\n    To testify his hidden residence.\n    How sweetly did they float upon the wings\n    Of silence, through the empty-vaulted night,                     250\n    At every fall smoothing the raven down\n    Of darkness till it smiled! I have oft heard\n    My mother Circe with the Sirens three,\n    Amidst the flowery-kirtled Naiades,\n    Culling their potent herbs and baleful drugs,\n    Who, as they sung, would take the prisoned soul,\n    And lap it in Elysium: Scylla wept,\n    And chid her barking waves into attention,\n    And fell Charybdis murmured soft applause.\n    Yet they in pleasing slumber lulled the sense,                   260\n    And in sweet madness robbed it of itself;\n    But such a sacred and home-felt delight,\n    Such sober certainty of waking bliss,\n    I never heard till now. I'll speak to her,\n    And she shall be my queen.--Hail, foreign wonder!\n    Whom certain these rough shades did never breed,\n    Unless the goddess that in rural shrine\n    Dwell'st here with Pan or Sylvan by blest song\n    Forbidding every bleak unkindly fog\n    To touch the prosperous growth of this tall wood.                270\n\n    _Lady._ Nay, gentle shepherd, ill is lost that praise\n    That is addressed to unattending ears.\n    Not any boast of skill, but extreme shift\n    How to regain my severed company,\n    Compelled me to awake the courteous Echo\n    To give me answer from her mossy couch.\n\n    _Comus._ What chance, good Lady, hath bereft you thus?\n\n    _Lady._ Dim darkness and this leafy labyrinth.\n\n    _Comus._ Could that divide you from near-ushering guides?\n\n    _Lady._ They left me weary on a grassy turf.                     280\n\n    _Comus._ By falsehood, or discourtesy, or why?\n\n    _Lady._ To seek i' the valley some cool friendly spring.\n\n    _Comus._ And left your fair side all unguarded, lady?\n\n    _Lady._ They were but twain, and purposed quick return.\n\n    _Comus._ Perhaps forestalling night prevented them.\n\n    _Lady._ How easy my misfortune is to hit!\n\n    _Comus._ Imports their loss, beside the present need?\n\n    _Lady._ No less than if I should my brothers lose.\n\n    _Comus._ Were they of manly prime, or youthful bloom?\n\n    _Lady._ As smooth as Hebe's their unrazored lips.                290\n\n    _Comus._ Two such I saw, what time the laboured ox\n    In his loose traces from the furrow came,\n    And the swinked hedger at his supper sat.\n    I saw them under a green mantling vine,\n    That crawls along the side of yon small hill,\n    Plucking ripe clusters from the tender shoots;\n    Their port was more than human, as they stood\n    I took it for a faery vision\n    Of some gay creatures of the element,\n    That in the colours of the rainbow live,                         300\n    And play i' the plighted clouds.

If otherwise,\n    I can conduct you, lady, to a low\n    But loyal cottage, where you may be safe                         320\n    Till further quest.\n\n    _Lady._              Shepherd, I take thy word,\n    And trust thy honest-offered courtesy,\n    Which oft is sooner found in lowly sheds,\n    With smoky rafters, than in tapestry halls\n    And courts of princes, where it first was named,\n    And yet is most pretended. In a place\n    Less warranted than this, or less secure,\n    I cannot be, that I should fear to change it.\n    Eye me, blest Providence, and square my trial\n    To my proportioned strength! Shepherd, lead on.\n\n[_Exeunt._\n\n_Enter the TWO BROTHERS._\n\n    _Elder Brother._ Unmuffle, ye faint stars; and thou, fair moon,  331\n    That wont'st to love the traveller's benison,\n    Stoop thy pale visage through an amber cloud,\n    And disinherit Chaos, that reigns here\n    In double night of darkness and of shades;\n    Or, if your influence be quite dammed up\n    With black usurping mists, some gentle taper,\n    Though a rush-candle from the wicker hole\n    Of some clay habitation, visit us\n    With thy long levelled rule of streaming light,                  340\n    And thou shalt be our star of Arcady,\n    Or Tyrian Cynosure.\n\n    _Second Brother._       Or, if our eyes\n    Be barred that happiness, might we but hear\n    The folded flocks, penned in their wattled cotes,\n    Or sound of pastoral reed with oaten stops,\n    Or whistle from the lodge, or village cock\n    Count the night-watches to his feathery dames,\n    'Twould be some solace yet, some little cheering,\n    In this close dungeon of innumerous boughs.\n    But, Oh, that hapless virgin, our lost sister!                   350\n    Where may she wander now, whither betake her\n    From the chill dew, amongst rude burs and thistles?\n    Perhaps some cold bank is her bolster now,\n    Or 'gainst the rugged bark of some broad elm\n    Leans her unpillowed head, fraught with sad fears.\n    What if in wild amazement and affright,\n    Or, while we speak, within the direful grasp\n    Of savage hunger, or of savage heat!\n\n    _Elder Brother._ Peace, brother: be not over-exquisite\n    To cast the fashion of uncertain evils;                          360\n    For, grant they be so, while they rest unknown,\n    What need a man forestall his date of grief,\n    And run to meet what he would most avoid?\n    Or, if they be but false alarms of fear,\n    How bitter is such self-delusion!\n    I do not think my sister so to seek,\n    Or so unprincipled in virtue's book,\n    And the sweet peace that goodness bosoms ever,\n    As that the single want of light and noise\n    (Not being in danger, as I trust she is not)                     370\n    Could stir the constant mood of her calm thoughts,\n    And put them into misbecoming plight.\n    Virtue could see to do what Virtue would\n    By her own radiant light, though sun and moon\n    Were in the flat sea sunk. And Wisdom's self\n    Oft seeks to sweet retired solitude,\n    Where, with her best nurse, Contemplation,\n    She plumes her feathers, and lets grow her wings,\n    That, in the various bustle of resort,\n    Were all to-ruffled, and sometimes impaired.                     380\n    He that has light within his own clear breast\n    May sit i' the centre, and enjoy bright day:\n    But he that hides a dark soul and foul thoughts\n    Benighted walks under the mid-day sun;\n    Himself is his own dungeon.\n\n    _Second Brother._            'Tis most true\n    That musing meditation most affects\n    The pensive secrecy of desert cell,\n    Far from the cheerful haunt of men and herds,\n    And sits as safe as in a senate-house;\n    For who would rob a hermit of his weeds,                         390\n    His few books, or his beads, or maple dish,\n    Or do his grey hairs any violence?\n    But Beauty, like the fair Hesperian tree\n    Laden with blooming gold, had need the guard\n    Of dragon-watch with unenchanted eye\n    To save her blossoms, and defend her fruit,\n    From the rash hand of bold Incontinence.\n    You may as well spread out the unsunned heaps\n    Of miser's treasure by an outlaw's den,\n    And tell me it is safe, as bid me hope                           400\n    Danger will wink on Opportunity,\n    And let a single helpless maiden pass\n    Uninjured in this wild surrounding waste.\n    Of night or loneliness it recks me not;\n    I fear the dread events that dog them both,\n    Lest some ill-greeting touch attempt the person\n    Of our unown\u00c3\u00a9d sister.\n\n    _Elder Brother._           I do not, brother,\n    Infer as if I thought my sister's state\n    Secure without all doubt or controversy;\n    Yet, where an equal poise of hope and fear                       410\n    Does arbitrate the event, my nature is\n    That I incline to hope rather than fear,\n    And gladly banish squint suspicion.\n    My sister is not so defenceless left\n    As you imagine; she has a hidden strength,\n    Which you remember not.\n\n    _Second Brother._        What hidden strength,\n    Unless the strength of Heaven, if you mean that?\n\n    _Elder Brother._ I mean that too, but yet a hidden strength,\n    Which, if Heaven gave it, may be termed her own.\n    'Tis chastity, my brother, chastity:                             420\n    She that has that is clad in c\u00c3\u00b3mplete steel,\n    And, like a quivered nymph with arrows keen,\n    May trace huge forests, and unharboured heaths,\n    Inf\u00c3\u00a1mous hills, and sandy perilous wilds;\n    Where, through the sacred rays of chastity,\n    No savage fierce, bandite, or mountaineer,\n    Will dare to soil her virgin purity.\n    Yea, there where very desolation dwells,\n    By grots and caverns shagged with horrid shades,\n    She may pass on with unblenched majesty,                         430\n    Be it not done in pride, or in presumption.\n    Some say no evil thing that walks by night,\n    In fog or fire, by lake or moorish fen,\n    Blue meagre hag, or stubborn unlaid ghost,\n    That breaks his magic chains at curfew time,\n    No goblin or swart faery of the mine,\n    Hath hurtful power o'er true virginity.\n    Do ye believe me yet, or shall I call\n    Antiquity from the old schools of Greece\n    To testify the arms of chastity?                                 440\n    Hence had the huntress Dian her dread bow\n    Fair silver-shafted queen for ever chaste,\n    Wherewith she tamed the brinded lioness\n    And spotted mountain-pard, but set at nought\n    The frivolous bolt of Cupid; gods and men\n    Feared her stern frown, and she was queen o' the woods.\n    What was that snaky-headed Gorgon shield\n    That wise Minerva wore, unconquered virgin,\n    Wherewith she freezed her foes to congealed stone,\n    But rigid looks of chaste austerity,                             450\n    And noble grace that dashed brute violence\n    With sudden adoration and blank awe?\n    So dear to Heaven is saintly chastity\n    That, when a soul is found sincerely so,\n    A thousand liveried angels lackey her,\n    Driving far off each thing of sin and guilt,\n    And in clear dream and solemn vision\n    Tell her of things that no gross ear can hear;\n    Till oft converse with heavenly habitants\n    Begin to cast a beam on the outward shape,                       460\n    The unpolluted temple of the mind,\n    And turns it by degrees to the soul's essence,\n    Till all be made immortal. But, when lust,\n    By unchaste looks, loose gestures, and foul talk,\n    But most by lewd and lavish act of sin,\n    Lets in defilement to the inward parts,\n    The soul grows clotted by contagion,\n    Imbodies, and imbrutes, till she quite loose\n    The divine property of her first being.\n    Such are those thick and gloomy shadows damp                     470\n    Oft seen in charnel-vaults and sepulchres,\n    Lingering and sitting by a new-made grave,\n    As loth to leave the body that it loved,\n    And linked itself by carnal sensualty\n    To a degenerate and degraded state.\n\n    _Second Brother._ How charming is divine Philosophy!\n    Not harsh and crabbed, as dull fools suppose,\n    But musical as is Apollo's lute,\n    And a perpetual feast of nectared sweets,\n    Where no crude surfeit reigns.\n\n    _Elder Brother._               List! list! I hear                480\n    Some far-off hallo break the silent air.\n\n    _Second Brother._ Methought so too; what should it be?\n\n    _Elder Brother._                                       For certain,\n    Either some one, like us, night-foundered here,\n    Or else some neighbour woodman, or, at worst,\n    Some roving robber calling to his fellows.\n\n    _Second Brother._ Heaven keep my sister! Again, again, and near!\n    Best draw, and stand upon our guard.\n\n    _Elder Brother._                     I'll hallo.\n    If he be friendly, he comes well: if not,\n    Defence is a good cause, and Heaven be for us!\n\n_Enter the ATTENDANT SPIRIT, habited like a shepherd._\n\n    That hallo I should know. What are you? speak.                   490\n    Come not too near; you fall on iron stakes else.\n\n    _Spirit._ What voice is that? my young Lord? speak again.\n\n    _Second Brother._ O brother, 'tis my father's shepherd, sure.\n\n    _Elder Brother._ Thyrsis! whose artful strains have oft delayed\n    The huddling brook to hear his madrigal,\n    And sweetened every musk-rose of the dale.\n    How camest thou here, good swain? Hath any ram\n    Slipped from the fold, or young kid lost his dam,\n    Or straggling wether the pent flock forsook?\n    How couldst thou find this dark sequestered nook?                500\n\n    _Spirit._ O my loved master's heir, and his next joy,\n    I came not here on such a trivial toy\n    As a strayed ewe, or to pursue the stealth\n    Of pilfering wolf; not all the fleecy wealth\n    That doth enrich these downs is worth a thought\n    To this my errand, and the care it brought,\n    But, oh! my virgin Lady, where is she?\n    How chance she is not in your company?\n\n    _Elder Brother._ To tell thee sadly, Shepherd, without blame\n    Or our neglect, we lost her as we came.                          510\n\n    _Spirit._ Ay me unhappy! then my fears are true.\n\n    _Elder Brother._ What fears, good Thyrsis? Prithee briefly shew.\n\n    _Spirit._ I'll tell ye. 'Tis not vain or fabulous\n    (Though so esteemed by shallow ignorance)\n    What the sage poets, taught by the heavenly Muse,\n    Storied of old in high immortal verse\n    Of dire Chimeras and enchanted isles,\n    And rifted rocks whose entrance leads to Hell;\n    For such there be, but unbelief is blind.\n      Within the navel of this hideous wood,                         520\n    Immured in cypress shades, a sorcerer dwells,\n    Of Bacchus and of Circe born, great Comus,\n    Deep skilled in all his mother's witcheries,\n    And here to every thirsty wanderer\n    By sly enticement gives his baneful cup,\n    With many murmurs mixed, whose pleasing poison\n    The visage quite transforms of him that drinks,\n    And the inglorious likeness of a beast\n    Fixes instead, unmoulding reason's mintage\n    Char\u00c3\u00a1ctered in the face. This have I learnt                      530\n    Tending my flocks hard by i' the hilly crofts\n    That brow this bottom glade; whence night by night\n    He and his monstrous rout are heard to howl\n    Like stabled wolves, or tigers at their prey,\n    Doing abhorred rites to Hecate\n    In their obscur\u00c3\u00a9d haunts of inmost bowers.\n    Yet have they many baits and guileful spells\n    To inveigle and invite the unwary sense\n    Of them that pass unweeting by the way.\n    This evening late, by then the chewing flocks                    540\n    Had ta'en their supper on the savoury herb\n    Of knot-grass dew-besprent, and were in fold,\n    I sat me down to watch upon a bank\n    With ivy canopied, and interwove\n    With flaunting honeysuckle, and began,\n    Wrapt in a pleasing fit of melancholy,\n    To meditate my rural minstrelsy,\n    Till fancy had her fill. But ere a close\n    The wonted roar was up amidst the woods,\n    And filled the air with barbarous dissonance;                    550\n    At which I ceased, and listened them awhile,\n    Till an unusual stop of sudden silence\n    Gave respite to the drowsy frighted steeds\n    That draw the litter of close-curtained Sleep.\n    At last a soft and solemn-breathing sound\n    Rose like a steam of rich distilled perfumes,\n    And stole upon the air, that even Silence\n    Was took ere she was ware, and wished she might\n    Deny her nature, and be never more,\n    Still to be so displaced. I was all ear,                         560\n    And took in strains that might create a soul\n    Under the ribs of Death. But, oh! ere long\n    Too well I did perceive it was the voice\n    Of my most honoured Lady, your dear sister.\n    Amazed I stood, harrowed with grief and fear;\n    And \"O poor hapless nightingale,\" thought I,\n    \"How sweet thou sing'st, how near the deadly snare!\"\n    Then down the lawns I ran with headlong haste,\n    Through paths and turnings often trod by day,\n    Till, guided by mine ear, I found the place                      570\n    Where that damned wizard, hid in sly disguise\n    (For so by certain signs I knew), had met\n    Already, ere my best speed could prevent,\n    The aidless innocent lady, his wished prey;\n    Who gently asked if he had seen such two,\n    Supposing him some neighbour villager.\n    Longer I durst not stay, but soon I guessed\n    Ye were the two she meant; with that I sprung\n    Into swift flight, till I had found you here;\n    But further know I not.\n\n    _Second Brother._       O night and shades,                      580\n    How are ye joined with hell in triple knot\n    Against the unarmed weakness of one virgin,\n    Alone and helpless! Is this the confidence\n    You gave me, brother?\n\n    _Elder Brother._          Yes, and keep it still;\n    Lean on it safely; not a period\n    Shall be unsaid for me. Against the threats\n    Of malice or of sorcery, or that power\n    Which erring men call Chance, this I hold firm:\n    Virtue may be assailed, but never hurt,\n    Surprised by unjust force, but not enthralled;                   590\n    Yea, even that which Mischief meant most harm\n    Shall in the happy trial prove most glory.\n    But evil on itself shall back recoil,\n    And mix no more with goodness, when at last,\n    Gathered like scum, and settled to itself,\n    It shall be in eternal restless change\n    Self-fed and self-consumed. If this fail,\n    The pillared firmament is rottenness,\n    And earth's base built on stubble. But come, let's on!\n    Against the opposing will and arm of Heaven                      600\n    May never this just sword be lifted up;\n    But, for that damned magician, let him be girt\n    With all the grisly legions that troop\n    Under the sooty flag of Acheron,\n    Harpies and Hydras, or all the monstrous forms\n    'Twixt Africa and Ind, I'll find him out,\n    And force him to return his purchase back,\n    Or drag him by the curls to a foul death,\n    Cursed as his life.\n\n    _Spirit._           Alas! good venturous youth,\n    I love thy courage yet, and bold emprise;                        610\n    But here thy sword can do thee little stead.\n    Far other arms and other weapons must\n    Be those that quell the might of hellish charms.\n    He with his bare wand can unthread thy joints,\n    And crumble all thy sinews.\n\n    _Elder Brother._            Why, prithee, Shepherd,\n    How durst thou then thyself approach so near\n    As to make this relation?\n\n    _Spirit._                  Care and utmost shifts\n    How to secure the Lady from surprisal\n    Brought to my mind a certain shepherd lad,\n    Of small regard to see to, yet well skilled                      620\n    In every virtuous plant and healing herb\n    That spreads her verdant leaf to the morning ray.\n    He loved me well, and oft would beg me sing;\n    Which when I did, he on the tender grass\n    Would sit, and hearken even to ecstasy,\n    And in requital ope his leathern scrip,\n    And show me simples of a thousand names,\n    Telling their strange and vigorous faculties.\n    Amongst the rest a small unsightly root,\n    But of divine effect, he culled me out.                          630\n    The leaf was darkish, and had prickles on it,\n    But in another country, as he said,\n    Bore a bright golden flower, but not in this soil:\n    Unknown, and like esteemed, and the dull swain\n    Treads on it daily with his clouted shoon;\n    And yet more med'cinal is it than that Moly\n    That Hermes once to wise Ulysses gave.\n    He called it H\u00c3\u00a6mony, and gave it me,\n    And bade me keep it as of sovran use\n    'Gainst all enchantments, mildew blast, or damp,                 640\n    Or ghastly Furies' apparition.\n    I pursed it up, but little reckoning made,\n    Till now that this extremity compelled.\n    But now I find it true; for by this means\n    I knew the foul enchanter, though disguised,\n    Entered the very lime-twigs of his spells,\n    And yet came off. If you have this about you\n    (As I will give you when we go) you may\n    Boldly assault the necromancer's hall;\n    Where if he be, with dauntless hardihood                         650\n    And brandished blade rush on him: break his glass,\n    And shed the luscious liquor on the ground;\n    But seize his wand. Though he and his curst crew\n    Fierce sign of battle make, and menace high,\n    Or, like the sons of Vulcan, vomit smoke,\n    Yet will they soon retire, if he but shrink.\n\n    _Elder Brother._ Thyrsis, lead on apace; I'll follow thee;\n    And some good angel bear a shield before us!\n\n_The Scene changes to a stately palace, set out with all manner of\ndeliciousness: soft music, tables spread with all dainties. COMUS\nappears with his rabble, and the LADY set in an enchanted chair: to whom\nhe offers his glass; which she puts by, and goes about to rise._\n\n    _Comus._ Nay, lady, sit. If I but wave this wand,\n    Your nerves are all chained up in alabaster,                     660\n    And you a statue, or as Daphne was,\n    Root-bound, that fled Apollo.\n\n    _Lady._                        Fool, do not boast.\n    Thou canst not touch the freedom of my mind\n    With all thy charms, although this corporal rind\n    Thou hast immanacled while Heaven sees good.\n\n    _Comus._ Why are you vexed, lady? why do you frown?\n    Here dwell no frowns, nor anger; from these gates\n    Sorrow flies far. See, here be all the pleasures\n    That fancy can beget on youthful thoughts,\n    When the fresh blood grows lively, and returns                   670\n    Brisk as the April buds in primrose season.\n    And first behold this cordial julep here,\n    That flames and dances in his crystal bounds,\n    With spirits of balm and fragrant syrups mixed.\n    Not that Nepenthes which the wife of Thone\n    In Egypt gave to Jove-born Helena\n    Is of such power to stir up joy as this,\n    To life so friendly, or so cool to thirst.\n    Why should you be so cruel to yourself,\n    And to those dainty limbs, which Nature lent                     680\n    For gentle usage and soft delicacy?\n    But you invert the covenants of her trust,\n    And harshly deal, like an ill borrower,\n    With that which you received on other terms,\n    Scorning the unexempt condition\n    By which all mortal frailty must subsist,\n    Refreshment after toil, ease after pain,\n    That have been tired all day without repast,\n    And timely rest have wanted.

If all the world                     720\n    Should, in a pet of temperance, feed on pulse,\n    Drink the clear stream, and nothing wear but frieze,\n    The All-giver would be unthanked, would be unpraised,\n    Not half his riches known, and yet despised;\n    And we should serve him as a grudging master,\n    As a penurious niggard of his wealth,\n    And live like Nature's bastards, not her sons,\n    Who would be quite surcharged with her own weight,\n    And strangled with her waste fertility:\n    The earth cumbered, and the winged air darked with plumes,       730\n    The herds would over-multitude their lords;\n    The sea o'erfraught would swell, and the unsought diamonds\n    Would so emblaze the forehead of the deep,\n    And so bestud with stars, that they below\n    Would grow inured to light, and come at last\n    To gaze upon the sun with shameless brows.\n    List, lady; be not coy, and be not cozened\n    With that same vaunted name, Virginity.\n    Beauty is Nature's coin; must not be hoarded,\n    But must be current; and the good thereof                        740\n    Consists in mutual and partaken bliss,\n    Unsavoury in the enjoyment of itself.\n    If you let slip time, like a neglected rose\n    It withers on the stalk with languished head.\n    Beauty is Nature's brag, and must be shown\n    In courts, at feasts, and high solemnities,\n    Where most may wonder at the workmanship.\n    It is for homely features to keep home;\n    They had their name thence: coarse complexions\n    And cheeks of sorry grain will serve to ply                      750\n    The sampler, and to tease the huswife's wool.\n    What need of vermeil-tinctured lip for that,\n    Love-darting eyes, or tresses like the morn?\n    There was another meaning in these gifts;\n    Think what, and be advised; you are but young yet.\n\n    _Lady._ I had not thought to have unlocked my lips\n    In this unhallowed air, but that this juggler\n    Would think to charm my judgment, as mine eyes,\n    Obtruding false rules pranked in reason's garb.\n    I hate when vice can bolt her arguments                          760\n    And virtue has no tongue to check her pride.\n    Impostor! do not charge most innocent Nature,\n    As if she would her children should be riotous\n    With her abundance. She, good cateress,\n    Means her provision only to the good,\n    That live according to her sober laws,\n    And holy dictate of spare Temperance.\n    If every just man that now pines with want\n    Had but a moderate and beseeming share\n    Of that which lewdly-pampered Luxury                             770\n    Now heaps upon some few with vast excess,\n    Nature's full blessings would be well dispensed\n    In unsuperfluous even proportions,\n    And she no whit encumbered with her store;\n    And then the Giver would be better thanked,\n    His praise due paid: for swinish gluttony\n    Ne'er looks to Heaven amidst his gorgeous feast,\n    But with besotted base ingratitude\n    Crams, and blasphemes his Feeder. Shall I go on?\n    Or have I said enow? To him that dares                           780\n    Arm his profane tongue with contemptuous words\n    Against the sun-clad power of chastity\n    Fain would I something say;--yet to what end?\n    Thou hast nor ear, nor soul, to apprehend\n    The sublime notion and high mystery\n    That must be uttered to unfold the sage\n    And serious doctrine of Virginity;\n    And thou art worthy that thou shouldst not know\n    More happiness than this thy present lot.\n    Enjoy your dear wit, and gay rhetoric,                           790\n    That hath so well been taught her dazzling fence;\n    Thou art not fit to hear thyself convinced.\n    Yet, should I try, the uncontroll\u00c3\u00a8d worth\n    Of this pure cause would kindle my rapt spirits\n    To such a flame of sacred vehemence\n    That dumb things would be moved to sympathise,\n    And the brute Earth would lend her nerves, and shake,\n    Till all thy magic structures, reared so high,\n    Were shattered into heaps o'er thy false head.\n\n    _Comus._ She fables not. I feel that I do fear                   800\n    Her words set off by some superior power;\n    And, though not mortal, yet a cold shuddering dew\n    Dips me all o'er, as when the wrath of Jove\n    Speaks thunder and the chains of Erebus\n    To some of Saturn's crew. I must dissemble,\n    And try her yet more strongly.--Come, no more!\n    This is mere moral babble, and direct\n    Against the canon laws of our foundation.\n    I must not suffer this; yet 'tis but the lees\n    And settlings of a melancholy blood.                             810\n\n    But this will cure all straight; one sip of this\n    Will bathe the drooping spirits in delight\n    Beyond the bliss of dreams.

Still she retains\n    Her maiden gentleness, and oft at eve\n    Visits the herds along the twilight meadows,\n    Helping all urchin blasts, and ill-luck signs\n    That the shrewd meddling elf delights to make,\n    Which she with precious vialed liquors heals:\n    For which the shepherds, at their festivals,\n    Carol her goodness loud in rustic lays,\n    And throw sweet garland wreaths into her stream                  850\n    Of pansies, pinks, and gaudy daffodils.\n    And, as the old swain said, she can unlock\n    The clasping charm, and thaw the numbing spell,\n    If she be right invoked in warbled song;\n    For maidenhood she loves, and will be swift\n    To aid a virgin, such as was herself,\n    In hard-besetting need.

The usual sense of 'discover' is to find\nout or make known, but in Milton and Shakespeare the prefix _dis-_ has\noften the more purely negative force of _un-_: hence discover = uncover,\nreveal. Comp.--\n\n                        \"Some high-climbing hill\n    Which to his eye _discovers_ unaware\n    The goodly prospect of some foreign land.\"\n\n    _Par. Lost_, iii. 546.\n\n~Attendant Spirit descends~. The part of the attendant spirit was taken by\nLawes (see Introduction), who, in his prologue or opening speech,\nexplains who he is and on what errand he has been sent, hints at the\nplot of the whole masque, and at the same time compliments the Earl in\nwhose honour the masque is being given (lines 30-36). In the ancient\nclassical drama the prologue was sometimes an outline of the plot,\nsometimes an address to the audience, and sometimes introductory to the\nplot. The opening of _Comus_ prepares the audience and also directly\naddresses it (line 43). For the form of the epilogue in the actual\nperformance of the masque see note, l. 975-6.\n\n1. ~starry threshold~, etc. Comp. Virgil: \"The sire of gods and monarch of\nmen summons a council to the starry chamber\" (_sideream in sedem_),\n_Aen._ x. 2.\n\n2. ~mansion~, abode. Trench points out that this word denotes strictly \"a\nplace of tarrying,\" which might be for a longer or a shorter time: hence\n'a resting-place.' Comp. _John_, xiv. 2, \"In my Father's house are many\n_mansions_\"; and _Il Pens._ 93, \"Her _mansion_ in this fleshly nook.\"\nThe word has now lost the notion of tarrying, and is applied to a large\nand important dwelling-house. ~where~, in which: the antecedent is\nseparated from the relative, a frequent construction in Milton (comp.\nlines 66, 821, etc.). So in Latin, where the grammatical connection\nwould generally be sufficiently indicated by the inflection. ~shapes ...\nspirits~. An instance of the manner in which Milton endows spiritual\nbeings with personality without making them too distinct. \"Of all the\npoets who have introduced into their works the agency of supernatural\nbeings Milton has succeeded best\" (Macaulay). We see this in _Par. Lost_\n(_e.g._ ii. 666). Compare the use of the word 'shape' (Lat. _umbra_) in\nl. 207: also _L'Alleg._ 4, \"horrid _shapes_ and shrieks\"; and _Il Pens._\n6, \"fancies fond with gaudy _shapes_ possess.\" Milton's use of the\ndemonstrative ~those~ in this line is noteworthy; comp. \"_that_ last\ninfirmity of noble mind,\" _Lyc._ 71: it implies that the reference is to\nsomething well known, and that further particularisation is needless.\n\n3. ~insphered~. 'Sphere,' with its derivatives 'sphery,' 'insphere,' and\n'unsphere' (_Il Pens._ 88), is used by Milton with a literal reference\nto the cosmical framework as a whole (see _Hymn Nat._ 48) or to some\nportion of it. In Shakespeare 'sphere' occurs in the wider sense of 'the\npath in which anything moves,' and it is to this metaphorical use of the\nword that we owe such phrases as 'a person's sphere of life,' 'sphere of\naction,' etc. See also _Comus_, 112-4, 241-3, 1021; _Arc._ 62-7; _Par.\nLost_, v. 618; where there are references to the music of the spheres.\n\n4. ~mild~: an attributive of the whole clause, 'regions of calm and serene\nair.' ~calm and serene~. These are not mere synonyms: the Lat. _serenus_ =\nbright or unclouded, so that the two epithets are to be respectively\ncontrasted with 'smoke' and 'stir' (line 5); 'calm' being opposed to\n'stir' and 'serene' to 'smoke.' Compare Homer's description of the seat\nof the gods: \"Not by wind is it shaken, nor ever wet with rain, nor doth\nthe snow come nigh thereto, but _most clear_ air is spread about it\n_cloudless_, and the white light floats over it,\" _Odyssey_, vi.: comp.\nnote, l. 977.\n\n5. ~this dim spot~. The Spirit describes the Earth as it appears to those\nimmortal shapes whose presence he has just quitted.\n\n6. There are here two attributive clauses: \"which men call Earth\" and\n\"(in which) men strive,\" etc. ~low-thoughted care~; narrow-minded anxiety,\ncare about earthly things. Comp. the form of the adjective 'low-browed,'\n_L'Alleg._ 8: both epithets are borrowed by Pope in his _Eloisa_.\n\n7. This line is attributive to 'men.' ~pestered ... pinfold~, crowded\ntogether in this cramped space, the Earth. _Pester_, which has no\nconnection with _pest_, is a shortened form of _impester_, Fr.\n_emp\u00c3\u00aatrer_, to shackle a horse by the foot when it is at pasture. The\nradical sense is that of clogging (comp. _Son._ xii. 1); hence of\ncrowding; and finally of annoyance or encumbrance of any kind. 'Pinfold'\nis strictly an enclosure in which stray cattle are _pounded_ or shut up:\netymologically, the word = _pind-fold_, a corruption of _pound-fold_.\nComp. _impound_, sheep-_fold_, etc.\n\n8. ~frail and feverish~. Comp. \"life's fitful fever\" (_Macbeth_, iii. 2.\n23). This line, like several of the adjacent ones, is alliterative.\n\n9. ~crown that Virtue gives~. This is Scriptural language: comp. _Rev._\niv. 4; 2 _Tim._ iv. 8, \"Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of\nrighteousness.\"\n\n10. ~this mortal change~. In Milton's MS. line 7 was followed by the\nwords, 'beyond the written date of mortal change,' _i.e._ beyond, or\nafter, man's appointed time to die. These words were struck out, but we\nmay suppose that the words 'mortal change' in line 10 have a similar\nmeaning. Milton frequently uses 'mortal' in the sense of 'liable to\ndeath,' and hence 'human' as opposed to 'divine': the mortal change is\ntherefore 'the change which occurs to all human beings.' Comp. _Job_,\nxiv. 14: \"all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my\n_change_ come\": see also line 841. Prof. Masson takes it to mean 'this\nmortal state of life,' as distinguished from a future state of\nimmortality. The Spirit uses 'this' as in line 8, in contrast with\n'those,' line 2.\n\n11. ~enthroned gods~, etc. In allusion to _Rev._ iv. 4, \"And upon the\nthrones I saw four and twenty elders sitting, arrayed in white garments;\nand on their heads crowns of gold.\" Milton frequently speaks of the\ninhabitants of heaven as _enthroned_. The accent here falls on the first\nsyllable of the word.\n\n12. ~Yet some there be~, etc.: 'Although men are generally so exclusively\noccupied with the cares of this life, there are nevertheless a few who\naspire,' etc. _Be_ is here purely indicative. This usage is frequent in\nElizabethan English, and still survives in parts of England. Comp.\n_Lines on Univ. Carrier_, ii. 25, where it occurs in a similar phrase,\n\"there be that say 't\": also lines 519, 668. It is employed to refer to\na number of persons or things, regarded as a class. ~by due steps~,\n_i.e._ by the steps that are due or appointed: comp. '_due_ feet,' _Il\nPens._ 155. _Due_, _duty_, and _debt_ are all from Lat. _debitus_, owed.\n\n13. ~their just hands~. 'Just' belongs to the predicate: 'to lay their\njust hands' = to lay their hands with justice. ~golden key~. Comp. _Matt._\nxvi. 19, \"I will give unto thee the _keys_ of the kingdom of heaven\";\nalso _Lyc._ 111:\n\n    \"Two massy keys he bore of metals twain\n    (The _golden_ opes, the iron shuts amain).\"\n\n15. ~errand~: comp. _Par. Lost_, iii. 652, \"One of the seven Who in God's\npresence, nearest to his throne, Stand ready at command, and are his\neyes That run through all the Heavens, or down to the Earth Bear his\nswift _errands_\": also vii. 579. ~but for such~, _i.e._ unless it were for\nsuch.\n\n16. 'I would not sully the purity of my heavenly garments with the\nnoisome vapour of this sin-corrupted earth.' ~ambrosial~, heavenly; also\nused by Milton in the sense of 'conferring immortality': comp. l. 840;\n_Par. Lost_, ii. 245; iv. 219, \"blooming _ambrosial_ fruit.\"\n'Ambrosial,' like 'amaranthus' (_Lyc._ 149), is cognate with the\nSanskrit _amr\u00c3\u00adta_, undying; and is applied by Homer to the hair of the\ngods: similarly in Tennyson's _Oenone_, 174: see also _In Memoriam_,\nlxxxvi. Ben Jonson (_Neptune's Triumph_) has 'ambrosian hands,' _i.e._\nhands fit for a deity. Ambrosia was the food of the gods. ~weeds~: now\nused chiefly in the phrase \"widow's weeds,\" _i.e._ mourning garment.\nMilton and Shakespeare use it in the general sense of garment or\ncovering: in the lines _On the Death of a Fair Infant_, it is applied to\nthe human body itself; comp. also _M. N. D._ ii. 1. 255, \"_Weed_ wide\nenough to wrap a fairy in.\" See also _Comus_, 189, 390.\n\n18. ~But to my task~, _i.e._ but I must proceed to my task: see l. 1012.\n\n19. ~every ... each~. It is usual to write _every ... every_, or _each ...\neach_, but Milton occasionally uses 'every' and 'each' together: comp.\nl. 311 and _Lyc._ 93, \"_every_ gust ... off _each_ beaked promontory.\"\n_Every_ denotes each without exception, and can now only be used with\nreference to more than two objects; _each_ may refer to two or more.\n\n20. ~by lot~, etc. When Saturn (Kronos) was dethroned, his empire of the\nuniverse was distributed amongst his three sons, Jupiter ('high' Jove),\nNeptune (the god of the Sea), and Pluto ('nether' or Stygian Jove). In\n_Iliad_ xv. Neptune (Poseidon) says: \"For three brethren are we, and\nsons of Kronos, whom Rhea bare ... And in three lots are all things\ndivided, and each drew a domain of his own, and to me fell the hoary\nsea, to be my habitation for ever, when we shook the lots.\" ~nether~,\nlower: comp. the phrase 'the upper and the nether lip,' and the name\nNetherlands. Hell, the abode of Pluto, is called by Milton 'the nether\nempire' (_Par. Lost_, ii. 295). The form _nethermost_ (_Par. Lost_, ii.\n955) is, like _aftermost_ and _foremost_, a double superlative.\n\n21. ~sea-girt isles~. Ben Jonson calls Britain a 'sea-girt isle': comp. l.\n27. _Isle_ is the M.E. _ile_, in which form the _s_ has been dropped: it\nis from O.F. _isle_, Lat. _insula_. It is therefore distinct from\n_island_, where an _s_ has, by confusion, been inserted. Island = M.E.\n_iland_, A.S. _igland_ (_ig_ = island: _land_ = land). In line 50 Milton\nwrote 'iland.'\n\n22. ~like to rich and various gems~, etc. Shakespeare describes England as\na 'precious stone set in the silver sea,' _Richard II._ ii. 1. 46: he\nalso speaks of Heaven as being _inlayed_ with stars, _Cym._ v. 5. 352;\n_M. of V._ v. 1. 59, \"Look how the floor of heaven Is thick _inlaid_\nwith patines of bright gold.\" Compare also _Par. Lost_, iv. 700, where\nMilton refers to the ground as having a rich _inlay_ of flowers. But for\nits inlay of islands the sea would be bare or unadorned. ~like~: here\nfollowed by the preposition _to_, and having its proper force as an\nadjective: comp. _Il Pens._ 9. Whether _like_ is used as an adjective\nor an adverb, the preposition is now usually omitted: comp. l. 57.\n\n24. ~to grace~, _i.e._ to show favour to: a clause of purpose.\n\n25. ~By course commits~, etc., _i.e._ \"In regular distribution he commits\nto each his distinct government.\" ~several~: separate or distinct.\nRadically _several_ is from the verb _sever_: it is now used only with\nplural nouns.\n\n26. ~sapphire~. This colour is again associated with the sea in line 29:\nsee note there.\n\n27. ~little tridents~, in contrast with that of Neptune, who, \"with his\ntrident touched the stars\" (_Neptune's Triumph, Proteus' Song_, Ben\nJonson).\n\n28. ~greatest and the best~. Comp. Shakespeare's eulogy in _Rich. II._ ii.\n1: also Ben Jonson's \"Albion, Prince of all his Isles,\" _Neptune's\nTriumph, Apollo's Song_.\n\n29. ~quarters~, divides into distinct regions. Comp. Dryden, _Georg. I._\n208:\n\n    \"Sailors _quarter'd_ Heaven, and found a name\n    For every fixt and ev'ry wandering star.\"\n\nSome would take the word as strictly denoting division into _four_\nparts: \"at that time the island was actually divided into four separate\ngovernments: for besides those at London and Edinburgh, there were Lords\nPresident of the North and of Wales.\" (Keightley). ~blue-haired deities~.\nThese must be distinct from the tributary gods who wield their little\ntridents (line 27), otherwise the thought would ill accord with the\ncomplimentary nature of lines 30-36. Regarding the epithet 'blue-haired'\nMasson asks: \"Can there be a recollection of blue as the British colour,\ninherited from the old times of blue-stained Britons who fought with\nCaesar? Green-haired is the usual epithet for Neptune and his\nsubordinates\": in Spenser, for example, the sea-nymphs have long green\nhair. But Ovid expressly calls the sea-deities _caerulei dii_, and\nNeptune _caeruleus deus_, thus associating blue with the sea.\n\n30. 'And all this region that looks towards the West (_i.e._ Wales) is\nentrusted to a noble peer of great integrity and power.' The peer\nreferred to is the Earl of Bridgewater. As Lord President he was\nentrusted with the civil and military administration of Wales and the\nfour English counties of Gloucester, Worcester, Hereford, and\nShropshire. That he was a nobleman of high character is shown by the\nfact that from 1617, when he was nominated one of \"his Majestie's\nCounsellors,\" he had continued to serve in various important public and\nprivate offices. On his monument there is the following: \"He was a\nprofound Scholar, an able Statesman, and a good Christian: he was a\ndutiful Son to his Mother the Church of England in her persecution, as\nwell as in her great splendour; a loyal Subject to his Sovereign in\nthose worst of times, when it was accounted treason not to be a traitor.\nAs he lived 70 years a pattern of virtue, so he died an example of\npatience and piety.\" ~falling sun~: Lat. _sol occidens_. Orient and\noccident (lit. 'rising' and 'falling') are frequently used to denote the\nEast and the West.\n\n31. ~mickle~ (A.S. _micel_) great. From this word comes _much_. 'Mickle'\nand 'muckle' are current in Scotland in the sense of great. Comp. _Rom.\nand Jul._ ii. 3. 15, \"O, _mickle_ is the powerful grace that lies In\nherbs,\" etc.\n\n33. ~An old and haughty nation~. The Welsh are Kelts, an Aryan people who\nprobably first entered Britain about B.C. 500: they are therefore\nrightly spoken of as an old nation. Compare Ben Jonson's piece _For the\nHonour of Wales_:\n\n    \"I is not come here to taulk of Brut,\n    From whence the Welse does take his root,\" etc.\n\nThat they were haughty and 'proud in arms' the Romans found, and after\nthem the Saxons: the latter never really held more than the counties of\nMonmouth and Hereford. In the reign of Edward I. attempts were made by\nthat king to induce the Welsh to come to terms, but the answer of the\nBarons was: \"We dare not submit to Edward, nor will we suffer our prince\nto do so, nor do homage to strangers, whose tongue, ways and laws we\nknow not of: we have only raised war in defence of our lands, laws and\nrights.\" By a statute of Henry VIII. this 'haughty' people were put in\npossession of the same rights and liberties as the English. ~proud in\narms~: this is Virgil's _belloque superbum_, _Aen._ i. 21 (Warton).\n\n34. ~nursed in princely lore~, brought up in a manner worthy of their high\nposition. It is to be noted that the Bridgewater family was by birth\ndistantly connected with the royal family. Milton may allude merely to\ntheir connection with the court. _Lore_ is cognate with _learn_.\n\n35. ~their father's state~. This probably refers to the actual ceremonies\nconnected with the installation of the Earl as Lord President. The old\nsense of 'state' is 'chair of state': comp. _Arc._ 81, and Jonson's\n_Hymenaei_, \"And see where Juno ... Displays her glittering _state and\nchair_.\"\n\n36. ~new-intrusted~, an adjective compounded of a participle and a simple\nadverb, _new_ being = newly; comp. 'smooth-dittied,' l. 86. Contrast the\nform of the epithet \"blue-haired,\" where the compound adjective is\nformed as if from a noun, \"blue-hair\": comp. \"rushy-fringed,\" l. 890.\nStrictly speaking, the Earl's power was not 'new-intrusted,' though it\nwas newly assumed. See Introduction.\n\n37. ~perplexed~, interwoven, entangled (Lat. _plecto_, to plait or\ntwist). The word is here used literally and is therefore applicable to\ninanimate objects. The accent is on the first syllable.\n\n38. ~horror~. This word is meant not merely to indicate terror, but also\nto describe the appearance of the paths. Horror is from Lat. _horrere_,\nto bristle, and may be rendered 'shagginess' or 'ruggedness,' just as\n_horrid_, l. 429, means bristling or rugged. Comp. _Par. Lost_, i. 563,\n\"a _horrid_ front Of dreadful length, and dazzling arms.\" ~shady brows~:\nthis may refer to the trees and bushes overhanging the paths, as the\nbrow overhangs the eyes.\n\n39. ~Threats~: not current as a verb. ~forlorn~, now used only as an\nadjective, is the past participle of the old verb _forleosen_, to lose\nutterly: the prefix _for_ has an intensive force, as in _forswear_; but\nin the latter word the sense of _from_ is more fully preserved in the\nprefix. See note, l. 234.\n\n40. ~tender age~. Lady Alice Egerton was about fourteen years of age; the\ntwo brothers were younger than she.\n\n41. ~But that~, etc. Grammatically, _but_ may be regarded as a\nsubordinative conjunction = 'unless (it had happened) that I was\ndespatched': or, taking it in its original prepositional sense, we may\nregard it as governing the substantive clause, 'that ... guard.' ~quick\ncommand~: the adjective has the force of an adverb, quick commands being\ncommands that are to be carried quickly. ~sovran~, supreme. This is\nMilton's spelling of the modern word _sovereign_, in which the _g_ is\ndue to the mistaken notion that the last syllable of the word is cognate\nwith _reign_. The word is from Lat. _superanum_ = chief: comp. l. 639.\n\n43. ~And listen why~; _sc._ 'I was despatched.' The language of lines 43,\n44 is suggested by Horace's _Odes_, iii. 1, 2: \"Favete linguis; carmina\nnon prius Audita ... canto.\" The poet implies that the plot of his mask\nis original: it is not (he says) to be found in any ancient or modern\nsong or tale that was ever recited either in the 'hall' (=\nbanqueting-hall) or in the 'bower' (= private chamber). Or 'hall' and\n'bower' may denote respectively the room of the lord and that of his\nlady.\n\n46. Milton in his usual significant manner (comp. _L'Allegro_ and _Il\nPenseroso_), proceeds to invent a genealogy for Comus. The mask is\ndesigned to celebrate the victory of Purity and Reason over Desire and\nEnchantment. Comus, who represents the latter, must therefore spring\nfrom parents representing the pleasure of man's lower nature and the\nmisuse of man's higher powers on behalf of falsehood and impurity. These\nparents are the wine-god Bacchus and the sorceress Circe. The former,\nmated with Love, is the father of Mirth (see _L'Allegro_); but, mated\nwith the cunning Circe, his offspring is a voluptuary whose gay\nexterior and flattering speech hide his dangerously seductive and\nmagical powers. He bears no resemblance, therefore, to Comus as\nrepresented in Ben Jonson's _Pleasure reconciled to Virtue_, in which\nmask \"Comus\" and \"The Belly\" are throughout synonymous. In the\n_Agamemnon_ of Aeschylus, Comus is a \"drinker of human blood\"; in\nPhilostratus, he is a rose-crowned wine-bibber; in Dekker he is \"the\nclerk of gluttony's kitchen\"; in Massinger he is \"the god of pleasure\";\nand in the work of Erycius Puteanus he is a graceful reveller, the\ngenius of love and cheerfulness. Prof. Masson says, \"Milton's _Comus_ is\na creation of his own, for which he was as little indebted intrinsically\nto Puteanus as to Ben Jonson. For the purpose of his masque at Ludlow\nCastle he was bold enough to add a brand-new god, no less, to the\nclassic Pantheon, and to import him into Britain.\" ~Bacchus~, the god who\ntaught men the preparation of wine. He is the Greek Dionysus, who, on\none of his voyages, hired a vessel belonging to some Tyrrhenian pirates:\nthese men resolved to sell him as a slave. Thereupon, he changed the\nmast and oars of the ship into serpents and the sailors into dolphins.\nThe meeting of Bacchus with Circe is Milton's own invention; in the\n_Odyssey_ it is Ulysses who lights upon her island: \"And we came to the\nisle \u00c3\u0086\u00c3\u00a6an, where dwelt Circe of the braided tresses, an awful goddess of\nmortal speech, own sister to the wizard \u00c3\u0086etes,\" _Odys._ x. ~from out~,\netc. Comp. _Par. Lost_, v. 345. 'From out' has the same force as the\nmore common 'out from.'\n\n47. ~misus\u00c3\u00a8d~, abused. The prefix _mis-_ was very generally used by\nMilton; _e.g._ _mislike_, _misdeem_, _miscreated_, _misthought_ (all\nobsolete).\n\n48. ~After the Tuscan mariners transformed~, _i.e._ after the\ntransformation of the Tuscan mariners (see Ovid, _Met._ iii.). They are\ncalled Tuscan, because Tyrrhenia in Central Italy was named Etruria or\nTuscia by the Romans: Etruria includes modern Tuscany. This grammatical\nconstruction is common in Latin; a passive participle combined with a\nsubstantive answering to an English verbal or abstract noun connected\nwith another noun by the preposition _of_, and used to denote a fact in\nthe past; _e.g._ \"since created man\" (_P. L._ i. 573) = since the\ncreation of man: \"this loss recovered\" (_P. L._ ii. 21) = the recovery\nof this loss.\n\n49. ~as the winds listed~; at the pleasure of the winds: comp. _John_,\niii. 8, \"the wind bloweth where it _listeth_\"; _Lyc._ 123. The verb\n_list_ is, in older English, generally used impersonally, and in Chaucer\nwe find 'if thee lust' or 'if thee list' = if it please thee. The word\nsurvives in the adjective _listless_ of which the older form was\n_lustless_: the noun _lust_ has lost its original and wider sense (which\nit still has in German), and now signifies 'longing desire.'\n\n50. ~On Circe's island fell~. Circe's island = Aeaea, off the coast of\nLatium. Circe was the daughter of Helios (the Sun) by the ocean-nymph\nPerse. On 'island,' see note, l. 21; and with this use of the verb\n_fall_ comp. the Latin _incidere in_. The sudden introduction of the\ninterrogative clause in this line is an example of the figure of speech\ncalled anadiplosis.\n\n51. ~charm\u00c3\u00a8d cup~, _i.e._ liquor that has been _charmed_ or rendered\nmagical. _Charms_ are incantations or magic verses (Lat. _carmina_):\ncomp. lines 526 and 817. Grammatically, 'cup' is the object of 'tasted.'\n\n52. ~Whoever tasted lost~, _i.e._ who tasted (he) lost. In this\nconstruction _whoever_ must precede both verbs; Shakespeare frequently\nuses _who_ in this sense, and Milton occasionally: comp. _Son._ xii. 12,\n\"_who_ loves that must first be wise and good.\" See Abbott, \u00c2\u00a7 251. ~lost\nhis upright shape~. In _Odyssey_ x. we read: \"So Circe led them\n(followers of Ulysses) in and set them upon chairs and high seats, and\nmade them a mess of cheese and barley-meal and yellow honey with\nPramnian wine, and mixed harmful drugs with the food to make them\nutterly forget their own country. Now when she had given them the cup\nand they had drunk it off, presently she smote them with a wand, and in\nthe styes of the swine she penned them. So they had the head and voice,\nthe bristles and the shape of swine, but their mind abode even as of\nold. Thus were they penned there weeping, and Circe flung them acorns\nand mast and fruit of the cornel tree to eat, whereon wallowing swine do\nalways batten.\" (_Butcher and Lang's translation._)\n\n54. ~clustering locks~: comp. l. 608. Milton here pictures the Theban\nBacchus, a type of manly beauty, having his head crowned with a wreath\nof vine and ivy: both of these plants were sacred to the god. Comp.\n_L'Alleg._ 16, \"ivy-crowned Bacchus\"; _Par. Lost_, iv. 303; _Sams.\nAgon._ 569.\n\n55. ~his blithe youth~, _i.e._ his fresh young figure.\n\n57. 'A son much like his father, but more like his mother.' This may\nindicate that it is upon Comus's character as a sorcerer rather than as\na reveller that the story of the mask depends. Comp. _Masque of Hymen_:\n\n    \"Much of the father's face,\n    More of the mother's grace.\"\n\n58. ~Comus~: see note, l. 46. The Greek word \u00ce\u00ba\u00e1\u00bf\u00b6\u00ce\u00bc\u00ce\u00bf\u00cf\u0082 denoted a\nrevel or merry-making; afterwards it came to mean the personification of\nriotous mirth, the god of Revel. Hence also the word _comedy_. In\nclassical mythology the individuality of Comus is not well defined: this\nenabled Milton more readily to endow him with entirely new\ncharacteristics.\n\n59. ~frolic~: an instance of the original use of the word as an adjective;\ncomp. _L'Alleg._ 18, \"frolic wind\"; Tennyson's _Ulysses_, \"a frolic\nwelcome.\" It is now chiefly used as a noun or a verb, and a new\nadjective, _frolicsome_, has taken its place; from this, again, comes\nthe noun _frolicsomeness_. _Frolic_ is from the Dutch, and cognate with\nGerman _fr\u00c3\u00b6hlich_, so that _lic_ in 'frolic' corresponds to _ly_ in such\nwords as cleanly, godly, etc. ~of~: this use of the preposition may be\ncompared with the Latin genitive in such phrases as _\u00c3\u00a6ger animi_ = sick\nof soul; of = 'because of' or 'in respect of.'\n\n60. ~Roving the Celtic and Iberian fields~, _i.e._ roving through Gaul and\nSpain. 'Rove' here governs an accusative: comp. _Lyc._ 173, \"walked the\nwaves\"; _Par. Lost_, i. 521, \"roamed the utmost Isles.\"\n\n61. ~betakes him~. The pronoun has here a reflective force: in Elizabethan\nEnglish, and still more often in Early English, this use of the simple\npronouns is common (see Abbott, \u00c2\u00a7 223). Compare l. 163. ~ominous~;\nliterally = full of omens or portents: comp. 'monstrous' = full of\nmonsters (_Lyc._ 158); also l. 79. 'Ominous' has now acquired the sense\nof 'ill-omened'; compare the acquired sense of 'hapless,' 'unfortunate,'\netc.\n\n65. ~orient~, bright. The Lat. _oriens_ = rising; hence (from being\napplied to the sun) = eastern (l. 30); and hence generally 'bright' or\n'shining': comp. _Par. Lost_, i. 546, \"With _orient_ colours waving.\"\n\n66. ~drouth of Phoebus~, _i.e._ thirst caused by the heat of the sun.\nPhoebus is Apollo, the Sun-god. Compare l. 928, where 'drouth' = want of\nrain; the more usual spelling is _drought_. ~which~: see note, l. 2.\n'Which' is here object of 'taste,' and refers to 'liquor.'\n\n67. ~fond~, foolish (its primary sense). _Fonned_ was the participle of an\nold verb _fonnen_, to be foolish. The word is now used to express great\nliking or affection: the idea of folly being almost entirely lost.\nChaucer has _fonne_, a fool: comp. _Il Pens._ 6, \"fancies _fond_\";\n_Lyc._ 56, \"I _fondly_ dream\"; _Sams. Agon._ 1682, \"So _fond_ are mortal\nmen.\"\n\n68. ~Soon as~, etc., _i.e._ as soon as the magical draught produces its\neffect. In line 66 _as_ is temporal. ~potion~. Radically, potion = a\ndrink, but it is generally used in the sense of a medicated or poisonous\ndraught. _Poison_ is the same word through the French.\n\n69. ~Express resemblance of the gods~. Comp. Shakespeare: \"What a piece of\nwork is man! ... in action how like an angel, in apprehension, how like a\ngod!\" See also _Par. Lost_, iii. 44, \"human face divine.\"\n\n71. ~ounce~. This is the _Felis uncia_, allied to the panther and the\ncheetah. Some connect it with the Persian _y\u00c3\u00baz_, panther.\n\n72. ~All other parts~, etc. In the _Odyssey_ (see note on l. 52) the\nbodies of those transformed by Circe were entirely changed; here only\nthe head. As one editor observes, this suited the convenience of the\nperformers who were to appear on the stage in masks (see _Stage\ndirection_, l. 92-3). Grammatically, line 72 is an example of the\nabsolute construction, common in Latin. The noun ('parts') is neither\nthe subject nor the object of a verb, but is used along with some\nattributive adjunct--generally a participle ('remaining')--to serve the\npurpose of an adverb or adverbial clause. The noun (or pronoun) is\nusually said to be the nominative absolute; but, in the case of\npronouns, Milton uses the nominative and the objective indifferently. In\nOld English the dative was used.\n\n73. ~perfect~, complete (Lat. _perfectus_, done thoroughly).\n\n74. ~Not once perceive~, etc. This was not the case with the followers of\nUlysses: see note, l. 52.\n\n76. ~friends and native home forgot~. Circe's cup has here the effect\nascribed to the lotus in _Odyssey_ ix. \"Now whosoever of them did eat\nthe honey-sweet fruit of the lotus had no more wish to bring tidings nor\nto come back, but there he chose to abide with the lotus-eating men,\never feeding on the lotus and forgetful of his homeward way.\" In\nTennyson's _Lotos-Eaters_ there is no forgetfulness of friends and home:\n\"Sweet it was to dream of Fatherland, Of child, and wife and slave.\"\nMasson also refers to Plato's ethical application of the story (_Rep._\nviii.); \"Plato speaks of the moral lotophagus, or youth steeped in\nsensuality, as accounting his very viciousness a developed manhood, and\nthe so-called virtues but signs of rusticity.\" Compare also Spenser, _F.\nQ._ ii. 12. 86, \"One above the rest in speciall, That had an hog been\nlate, ... did him miscall, That had from hoggish form him brought to\nnatural.\"\n\n77. ~sensual sty~: see note on l. 52. To those who, \"with low-thoughted\ncare,\" are \"unmindful of the crown that Virtue gives,\" the world becomes\nlittle better than a sensual sty. This line is adverbial to _forget_.\n\n78. ~favoured~: compare Lat. _gratus_ = favoured (adj.).\n\n79. ~adventurous~, full of risks. The current sense of 'adventurous,'\napplied only to persons, is \"enterprising.\" See l. 61, 609. ~glade~:\nstrictly, an open space in a wood, and hence applied (as here) to the\nwood itself. It is cognate with _glow_ and _glitter_, and its\nfundamental sense is 'a passage for light' (Skeat).\n\n80. ~glancing star~, a shooting star. Comp. _Par. Lost_, iv. 556:\n\n          \"Swift as a shooting star\n    In autumn thwarts the night.\"\n\nThe rhythm of the line and the prevalence of sibilants suit the sense.\n\n81. ~convoy~: comp. _Par. Lost_, vi. 752, \"_convoyed_ By four cherubic\nshapes.\" It is another form of _convey_ (Lat. _con_ = together, _via_ =\na way).\n\n83. ~sky-robes~: the \"ambrosial weeds\" of line 16. ~Iris' woof~, material\ndyed in rainbow colours. The goddess Iris was a personification of the\nrainbow: comp. l. 992 and _Par. Lost_, xi. 244, \"Iris had dipped the\nwoof.\" Etymologically, _woof_ is connected with _web_ and _weave_: it is\nshort for _on-wef_ = on-web, _i.e._ the cross threads laid on the warp\nof a loom.\n\n84. ~weeds~: see note, l. 16.\n\n86. ~That to the service~, etc. The part of the Spirit was acted by Lawes,\nfirst in \"sky-robes,\" then in shepherd dress. In the dedication of\n_Comus_ by Lawes to Lord Brackley (anonymous edition of 1637), he\nalludes to the favours that had been shown him by the Bridgewater\nfamily. In the above lines Milton compliments Lawes and enables Lawes to\ncompliment the Earl (see Introduction).\n\n86. ~smooth-dittied~: sweetly-worded. 'Ditty' (Lat. _dictatum_) strictly\ndenotes the words of a song as distinct from the musical accompaniment;\nit is now applied to any little piece intended to be sung: comp. _Lyc._\n32. For a similar panegyric on Lawes' musical genius compare _Son._\nxiii. The musical alliteration in lines 86-88 should be noted.\n\n87. ~knows to still~, etc.: comp. _Lyc._ 10, \"he knew Himself to sing.\"\n\n88. ~nor of less faith~, etc.; _i.e._ he is not less faithful than he is\nskilful in music; and from the nature of his occupation he is most\nlikely to be at hand should any emergency arise.\n\n92. ~viewless~, invisible: comp. _The Passion_, 50, \"_viewless_ wing\";\n_Par. Lost_, iii. 518. Masson calls this a peculiarly Shakespearian\nword: see _M. for M._ iii. 1. 124, \"To be imprisoned in the viewless\nwinds.\" The word is obsolete, but poets use great liberty in the\nformation of adjectives in _-less_: comp. Shelley's _Sensitive Plant_,\n'windless clouds.' See note, l. 574. ~charming-rod~: see note, l. 52: also\nl. 653. ~rout~, a disorderly crowd. The word is also used in the sense of\n'defeat,' and is cognate with _route_, _rote_, and _rut_. All come from\nLat. _ruptus_, broken: a 'rout' is the breaking up of a crowd, or a\ncrowd broken up; a 'route' is a way broken through a forest; 'rote' is a\nbeaten track; and a 'rut' is a track left by a wheel. See _Lyc._ 61, \"by\nthe _rout_ that made the hideous roar.\"\n\n93. ~star ... fold~, the evening star, Hesperus, an appellation of the\nplanet Venus: comp. _Lyc._ 30. As the morning star (called by\nShakespeare the 'unfolding star'), it is called Phosphorus or Lucifer,\nthe light-bringer. Hence Tennyson's allusion:\n\n    \"Bright Phosphor, fresher for the night,...\n    Sweet _Hesper-Phosphor_, double name.\"--\n\n    _In Memoriam_, cxxi.\n\nLines 93-144 are in rhymed couplets, and consist for the most part of\neight syllables each. The prevailing accentuation is iambic.\n\n94. ~top of heaven~, etc., _i.e._ is far above the horizon. So in _Lyc._\n31, it is said to slope \"toward heaven's _descent_,\" _i.e._ to sink\ntowards the horizon. Comp. Virgil, _Aen._ ii. 250, \"Round rolls the sky,\nand on comes Night from the ocean.\"\n\n95. ~gilded car~: Apollo, as the god of the Sun, rode in a golden chariot.\nComp. Chaucer, _Test. of Creseide_, 208, \"Phoebus' golden cart\"; and\n\"Phoebus' wain,\" line 190.\n\n96. ~his glowing axle doth allay~. In the _Hymn of the Nativity_ Milton\nalludes to the \"burning axle-tree\" of the sun: comp. _Aen._ iv. 482,\n\"Atlas _Axem_ umero torquet.\" There is here an allusion to the opinion\nof the ancients that the setting of the sun in the Atlantic Ocean was\naccompanied with a noise, as of the sea hissing (Todd). 'Allay' would\nthus denote 'quench' or 'cool.' _His_, in this line, = _its_. _Its_\noccurs only three times in Milton's poems, _Od. Nat._ 106; _Par. Lost_,\ni. 254; _Par. Lost_, iv. 813: the word is found also in Lawes'\ndedication of _Comus_. The word does not occur in English at all until\nthe end of the sixteenth century, the possessive case of the neuter\npronoun _it_ and of the masculine _he_ being _his_. This gave rise to\nconfusion when the old gender system decayed, and the form _its_\ngradually came into use, until, by the end of the seventeenth century,\nit was in general use. Milton, however, scarcely recognised it, its\nplace in his involved syntax being taken by the relative pronouns and\nother connectives, or by _his_, _her_, _thereof_, etc.\n\n97. ~steep Atlantic stream~. To the ancients the Ocean was the great\n_stream_ that encompassed the earth: _Iliad_, xiv., \"the deep-flowing\nOkeanos (\u00ce\u00b2\u00ce\u00b1\u00ce\u00b8\u00cf\u008d\u00cf\u0081\u00cf\u0081\u00ce\u00bf\u00ce\u00bf\u00cf\u0082).\" With this use of 'steep' compare the\nphrase 'the high seas.'\n\n98. ~slope sun~, sun sunk beneath the horizon, so that the only rays\nvisible shoot up into the sky. _Slope_ = sloped; also used by Milton as\nan adverb = aslope (_Par. Lost_, iv. 591), and as a verb (_Lyc._ 31).\n\n99. ~dusky~. Milton first wrote 'northern.'\n\n100. ~Pacing toward the other goal~, etc. Comp. _Psalm_ xix. 5: \"The sun\nas a bridegroom cometh out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man\nto run a race.\"\n\n102. The spirit of lines 102-144 may be contrasted with that of\n_L'Allegro_, 25-40. Both pieces are calls upon Mirth and Pleasure, and\nboth are therefore suitably expressed in the same tripping measure and\nwith many similarities of language. But the pleasures of _L'Allegro_\nbegin with the sun-rise and yet are \"unreproved\"; those of _Comus_ and\nhis crew begin with the darkness and are \"unreproved\" only if \"these dun\nshades will ne'er report\" them. The \"light fantastic toe\" of the one is\nnot the \"tipsy dance\" of the other; and the laughter and liberty that\nbetoken the absence of \"wrinkled Care\" have nothing in common with the\n\"midnight shout and revelry\" that can be enjoyed only when Rigour,\nAdvice, strict Age, and sour Severity have \"gone to bed.\" The \"quips and\ncranks\" of _L'Allegro_ have given way to the magic rites of _Comus_, and\nthe wreathed smiles and dimples that adorn the face of innocent Mirth are\nill replaced by the wine-dropping \"rosy twine\" of revelry.\n\n104. ~jollity~: has here its modern sense of boisterous mirth. In Milton\noccasionally the adjective 'jolly' (Fr. _joli_, pretty) has its primary\nsense of pleasing or festive.\n\n105. ~Braid your locks with rosy twine~; 'entwine your hair with wreaths\nof roses.'\n\n106. ~dropping odours~: comp. l. 862-3.\n\n108. ~Advice ... scrupulous head~. 'Advice,' now used chiefly to signify\ncounsel given by another, was formerly used also of self-counsel or\ndeliberation. See Chaucer, _Prologue_, 786, \"granted him without more\n_advice_\"; and comp. Shakespeare, _M. of V._ iv. 2. 6, \"Bassanio upon\nmore _advice_, Hath sent you here this ring\"; also _Par. Lost_, ii. 376,\n\"_Advise_, if this be worth Attempting,\" where 'advise' = consider. See\nalso l. 755, note. _Scrupulous_ = full of scruples, conscientious.\n\n110. ~saws~, sayings, maxims. _Saw_, _say_, and _saga_ (a Norwegian\nlegend) are cognate.\n\n111. ~of purer fire~, _i.e._ having a higher or diviner nature. (Or, as\nthere is really no question of degree, we may render the phrase as =\ndivine.) Compare the Platonic doctrine that each element had living\ncreatures belonging to it, those of fire being the gods; similarly the\nStoics held that whatever consisted of _pure fire_ was divine, _e.g._\nthe stars: hence the additional significance of line 112.\n\n112. ~the starry quire~: an allusion to the music of the spheres; see\nlines 3, 1021. Pythagoras supposed that the planets emitted sounds\nproportional to their distances from the earth and formed a celestial\nconcert too melodious to affect the \"gross unpurg\u00c3\u00a8d ear\" of mankind:\ncomp. l. 458 and _Arc._ 63-73. Shakespeare (_M. of V._ v. 1. 61) alludes\nto the music of the spheres:\n\n    \"There's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st\n    But in his motion like an angel sings,\n    Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins,\" etc.\n\n_Quire_ is a form of _choir_ (Lat. _chorus_, a band of singers); in\nGreek tragedy the chorus was supposed to represent the sentiments of the\naudience. _Quire_ (of paper) is a totally different word, probably\nderived from Lat. _quatuor_, four.\n\n113. ~nightly watchful spheres~. Milton elsewhere alludes to the stars\nkeeping watch: \"And all the spangled host keep watch in order bright,\"\n_Hymn Nat._ 21. 'Nightly,' used as an adjective in the sense of\n'nocturnal': comp. _Il Pens._ 84, \"To bless the doors from _nightly_\nharm\"; _Arc._ 48, \"_nightly_ ill\"; and Wordsworth's line: \"The _nightly_\nhunter lifting up his eyes.\" Its ordinary sense is \"night by night.\"\n\n114. ~Lead in swift round~. Comp. _Arc._ 71: \"And the low world in\nmeasured motion draw, After the heavenly tune.\"\n\n115. ~sounds~, straits: A.S. _sund_, a strait of the sea, so called\nbecause it could be _swum_ across. See Skeat, _Etym. Dict._ _s.v._\n\n116. ~to the moon~, _i.e._ as affected by the moon. For similar uses of\n'to,' comp. _Lyc._ 33, \"tempered _to_ the oaten flute\"; _Lyc._ 44,\n\"fanning their joyous leaves _to_ thy soft lays.\" ~morrice~. The waters\nquiver in the moonlight as if dancing. The morrice = a morris or Moorish\ndance, brought into Spain by the Moors, and thence introduced into\nEngland by John of Gaunt. We read also of a \"morris-pike\"--a weapon used\nby the Moors in Spain.\n\n117. ~shelves~, flat ledges of rock.\n\n118. ~pert~, lively. Here used in its radical sense (being a form of\n_perk_, smart): its modern sense is 'forward' or 'impertinent.' Skeat\npoints out that _perk_ and _pert_ were both used as verbs; _e.g._\n\"_perked_ up in a glistering grief,\" _Henry VIII._ ii. 3. 21: \"how it (a\nchild) speaks, and looks, and _perts_ up the head,\" Beaumont and\nFletcher's _Knight of the Burning Pestle_, i. 1. A similar change of _k_\ninto _t_ is seen in E. _mate_ from M.E. _make_. ~dapper~, quick (Du.\n_dapper_, Ger. _tapfer_, brave, quick). It is usual in the sense of\n'neat.'\n\n119. ~dimple~. _Dimple_ is a diminutive of _dip_, and cognate with\n_dingle_ and _dapple_.\n\n120. ~daisies trim~: comp. _L'Alleg._ 75, \"Meadows _trim_, with daisies\npied\"; _Il Pens._ 50, \"_trim_ gardens.\"\n\n121. ~wakes~, night-watches (A.S. _niht-wacu_, a night wake). The\nadjective _wakeful_ (A.S. _wacol_) is the exact cognate of the Latin\n_vigil_. The word was applied to the vigil kept at the dedication of a\nchurch, then to the feast connected therewith, and finally to an evening\nmerry-making. ~prove~, test, judge of (Lat. _probare_). This is its sense\nin older writers and in the much-misunderstood phrase--\"the exception\n_proves_ the rule,\" which means that the exception is a test of the\nrule.\n\n124. ~Venus now wakes~, etc. Spenser, _Brit. Ida_, ii. 3, has \"Night is\nLove's holyday.\" In this line ~wakens~ is used transitively, its object\nbeing 'Love.'\n\n125. ~rights~. Here used, as sometimes by Spenser, where modern usage\nrequires _rites_ (Lat. _ritus_, a custom): see l. 535.\n\n126. ~daylight ... sin~. Daylight makes sin by revealing it. Contrast the\nsentiment of Comus with that of Milton in _Par. Lost_, i. 500, \"When\nnight Darkens the streets, then wander forth the sons Of Belial.\"\n\n127. ~dun shades~: evidently suggested by Fairfax's _Tasso_, ix. 62, \"The\nhorrid darkness, and the shadows _dun_.\" 'Dun' is A.S. _dunn_, dark.\n\n129. ~Cotytto~, the goddess of Licentiousness: here called 'dark-veiled'\nbecause her midnight orgies were veiled in darkness. She was a Thracian\ndivinity, and her worshippers were called Baptae ('sprinkled'), because\nthe ceremony of initiation involved the sprinkling of warm water.\n\n131. ~called~, invoked. ~dragon-womb Of Stygian darkness~. The Styx (= 'the\nabhorred') was the chief river in the lower world. Milton here speaks of\ndarkness as something positive, ejected from the womb of Night, Night\nbeing represented as a monster of the lower regions: comp. _Par. Lost_,\ni. 63. The pronoun 'her' shows that 'womb' is here used in its strict\nsense, but in _Par. Lost_, i. 673, \"in his _womb_ was hid metallic ore,\"\nit has the more general sense of \"interior\": comp. the use of Lat.\n_uterus_, _Aen._ ii. 258, vii. 499. ~dragon~: Shakespeare refers to the\ndragons or 'dragon car' of night, _Cym._ ii. 2. 48, \"Swift, swift, you\n_dragons_ of the night\"; _Tro. and Cress._ v. 8. 17, \"The _dragon_ wing\nof night o'erspreads the earth\"; see also _Il Pens._ 59, \"Cynthia checks\nher dragon yoke.\"\n\n132. ~spets~, a form of _spits_ (as _spettle_ for _spittle_).\n\n133. ~one blot~, _i.e._ a universal blot: comp. _Macbeth_, ii. 2. 63.\nMilton first wrote, \"And makes a blot of nature.\"\n\n134. ~Stay~, here used causally = check. The radical sense of the word is\n'to support,' as in the substantive _stay_ and its plural _stays_. ~ebon~,\nblack as ebony. Ebony is so called because it is hard as a stone (Heb.\n_eben_, a stone); and the wood being of a dark colour, the name has\nbecome a synonym both for hardness and for blackness.\n\n135. ~Hecat'~, _i.e._ Hecat\u00c3\u00a8 (as in line 535): a mysterious Thracian\ndivinity, afterwards regarded as the goddess of witchcraft: for these\nreasons a fit companion for Cotytto and a fit patroness of Comus. Jonson\ncalls her \"the mistress of witches.\" She was supposed to send forth at\nnight all kinds of demons and phantoms, and to wander about with the\nsouls of the dead and amidst the howling of dogs.\n\n136. ~utmost end~, full completion. Compare _L'Alleg._ 109, \"the corn\nThat ten day-labourers could not _end_,\" where 'end' = 'complete.'\n\n137. ~dues~: see note, l. 12.\n\n138. ~blabbing eastern scout~, _i.e._ the tale-telling spy that comes from\nthe East, viz. Morning.\n\n139. ~nice~; hard to please, fastidious: \"a finely chosen epithet,\nexpressing at once _curious_ and _squeamish_\" (Hurd). It is used by\nComus in contempt: comp. ii. _Henry IV._ iv. 1, \"Hence, therefore, thou\n_nice_ crutch\"; and see the index to the Globe _Shakespeare_. ~the Indian\nsteep~. In his _Elegia Tertia_ Milton represents the sun as the\n\"light-bringing king\" whose home is on the shores of the Ganges (_i.e._\nin the far East): comp. \"the Indian mount,\" _Par. Lost_, i. 781, and\nTennyson's _In Memoriam_, xxvi., \"ere yet the morn Breaks hither over\n_Indian_ seas.\"\n\n140. ~cabined loop-hole~: an allusion to the first glimpse of dawn, _i.e._\nthe peep of day. Comp. \"Out of her window close she blushing peeps,\"\nsaid of the morning (P. Fletcher's _Eclogues_), as if the first rays of\nthe sun struggled through some small aperture. 'Cabined,' literally\n'belonging to a cabin,' and therefore small.\n\n141. ~tell-tale Sun~. Compare Spenser, _Brit. Ida_, ii. 3,\n\n    \"The thick-locked boughs shut out the _tell-tale_ sun,\n    For Venus hated his _all-blabbing_ light.\"\n\nShakespeare refers to \"the tell-tale day\" (_R. of L._ 806). In\n_Odyssey_, viii., we read how Helios (the sun) kept watch and informed\nVulcan of Venus's love for Mars. ~descry~, etc., _i.e._ make known our\nhidden rites. 'Descry' is here used in its primary sense = _describe_:\nboth words are from Lat. _describere_, to write fully. In Milton and\nShakespeare 'descry' also occurs in the sense of 'to reconnoitre.'\n\n142. ~solemnity~, ceremony, rite. The word is from Lat. _sollus_,\ncomplete, and _annus_, a year; 'solemn' = _solennis_ = _sollennis_.\nHence the changes of meaning: (1) recurring at the end of a completed\nyear; (2) usual; (3) religious, for sacred festivals recur at stated\nintervals; (4) that which is not to be lightly undertaken, _i.e._\nserious or important.\n\n143. ~knit hands~, etc. Comp. _Masque of Hymen_:\n\n    \"Now, now begin to set\n    Your spirits in active heat;\n    And, since your hands are met,\n    Instruct your nimble feet,\n    In motions swift and meet,\n    The happy ground to beat.\"\n\n144. ~light fantastic round~: comp. _L'Alleg._ 34, \"Come, and trip it, as\nyou go, On the light fantastic toe.\" A round is a dance or 'measure' in\nwhich the dancers join hands, 'Fantastic' = full of fancy, unrestrained.\nSo Shakespeare uses it of that which has merely been imagined, and has\nnot yet happened. It is now used in the sense of grotesque. _Fancy_ is a\nform of _fantasy_ (Greek _phantasia_).\n\nAt this point in the mask Comus and his rout dance a measure, after\nwhich he again speaks, but in a different strain. The change is marked\nby a return to blank verse: the previous lines are mostly in\noctosyllabic couplets.\n\n145. ~different~, _i.e._ different from the voluptuous footing of Comus\nand his crew.\n\n146. ~footing~: comp. _Lyc._ 103, \"Camus, reverend sire, went _footing_\nslow.\"\n\n147. ~shrouds~, coverts, places of hiding. The word etymologically denotes\n'something cut off,' being allied to 'shred'; hence a garment; and\nfinally (as in Milton) any covering or means of covering. Many of\nLatimer's sermons are described as having been \"preached in The\nShrouds,\" a covered place near St. Paul's Cathedral. The modern use of\nthe word is restricted: comp. l. 316. ~brakes~, bushes. Shakespeare has\n\"hawthorn-_brake_,\" _M. N. D._ iii. l. 3, and the word seems to be\nconnected with _bracken_.\n\n148. ~Some virgin sure~, _sc._ 'it is.'\n\n150. ~charms ... wily trains~; _i.e._ spells ... cunning allurements.\n_Charm_ is the Lat. _carmen_, a song, also used in the sense of 'magic\nverses'; wily = full of _wile_ (etymologically the same as guile).\n_Train_ here denotes an artifice or snare as in 'venereal trains'\n(_Sams. Agon._ 533): \"Oh, _train_ me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note\"\n(_Com. of Errors_, iii. 2. 45). See Index, Globe _Shakespeare_. Some\nwould take 'wily trains' as = trains of wiles.\n\n151. ~ere long~: _ere_ has here the force of a preposition; in A.S. it was\nan adverb as well = soon, but now it is used only as a conjunction or a\npreposition.\n\n153. ~Thus I hurl~, etc. \"Conceive that at this moment of the performance\nthe actor who personates Comus flings into the air, or makes a gesture\nas if flinging into the air, some powder, which, by a stage-device, is\nkindled so as to produce a flash of blue light. In the original draft\namong the Cambridge MSS. the phrase is _powdered spells_; but Milton, by\na judicious change, concealing the mechanism of the stage-trick,\nsubstituted _dazzling_\" (Masson).\n\n154. ~dazzling~. This implies both brightness and illusion. ~spells~. A\n_spell_ is properly a magical form of words (A.S. _spel_, a saying):\nhere it refers to the whole enchantment employed. ~spongy air~: so called\nbecause it holds in suspension the magic powder.\n\n155. ~Of power to cheat ... and (to) give~, etc. These lines are\nattributive to 'spells.' The preposition 'of' is thus used to denote a\ncharacteristic; thus 'of power' = powerful; comp. l. 677. ~blear\nillusion~; deception, that which deceives by _blurring_ the vision.\nShakespeare has 'bleared thine eye' = dimmed thy vision, deceived (_Tam.\nShrew_, v. 1. 120). Comp. \"This may stand for a pretty superficial\nargument, to _blear_ our eyes, and lull us asleep in security\" (Sir W.\nRaleigh). _Blur_ is another form of _blear_.\n\n156. ~presentments~, appearances. This word is to be distinguished from\n_presentiment_. A presentiment is a \"fore-feeling\" (Lat. _praesentire_):\nwhile a presentment is something presented (Lat. _praesens_, being\nbefore). Shakespeare, _Ham._ iii. 4. 54, has 'presentment' in the sense\nof picture. ~quaint habits~, unfamiliar dress. Quaint is from Lat.\n_cognitus_, so that its primary sense is 'known' or 'remarkable.' In\nFrench it became _coint_, which was treated as if from Lat. _comptus_,\nneat; hence the word is frequent in the sense of neat, exact, or\ndelicate. Its modern sense is 'unusual' or 'odd.'\n\n158. ~suspicious flight~: flight due to suspicion of danger.\n\n160. ~I, under fair pretence~, etc.: 'Under the mask of friendly\nintentions and with the plausible language of wheedling courtesy, I\ninsinuate myself into the unsuspecting mind and ensnare it.'\n\n161. ~glozing~, flattering, wheedling. Compare _Par. Lost_, ix. 549,\n\n    \"So _glozed_ the temper, and his proem tuned:\n    Into the heart of Eve his words made way.\"\n\n_Gloze_ is from the old word _glose_, a gloss or explanation (Gr.\n_glossa_, the tongue): hence also glossary, glossology, etc. Trench, in\nhis lecture on the Morality of Words, points out how often fair names\nare given to ugly things: it is in this way that a word which merely\ndenoted an explanation has come to denote a false explanation, an\nendeavour to deceive. The word has no connection with _gloss_ =\nbrightness.\n\n162. ~Baited~, rendered attractive. Radically _bait_ is the causative of\n_bite_; hence a trap is said to be baited. Comp. _Sams. Ag._ 1066, \"The\n_bait_ of honied words.\"\n\n163. ~wind me~, etc. The verbs _wind_ (_i.e._ coil) and _hug_ suggest the\ncunning of the serpent. The easy-hearted man is the person whose heart\nor mind is easily overcome: 'man' is here used generically. Burton, in\n_Anat. of Mel._, says: \"The devil, being a slender incomprehensible\nspirit, can easily insinuate and _wind_ himself into human bodies.\"\n_Me_ is here used reflexively: see note, l. 61. This is not the ethic\ndative.\n\n165. ~virtue~, _i.e._ power or influence (Lat. _virtus_). This radical\nsense is still found in the phrase 'by virtue of' = by the power of. The\nadjective _virtuous_ is now used only of moral excellence: in line 621\nit has its older meaning.\n\n166. The reading of the text is that of the editions of 1637 and 1645.\nIn the edition of 1673 the reading was:\n\n    \"I shall appear some harmless villager,\n    And hearken, if I may, her business here.\n    But here she comes, I fairly step aside.\"\n\nBut in the errata there was a direction to omit the comma after _may_,\nand to change _here_ into _hear_. In Masson's text, accordingly, he\nreads: \"And hearken, if I may her business hear.\"\n\n167. ~keeps up~, etc., _i.e._ keeps occupied with his country affairs even\nup to a late hour. _Gear_: its original sense is 'preparation' (A.S.\n_gearu_, ready); hence 'business' or 'property.' Comp. Spenser, _F. Q._\nvi. 3. 6, \"That to Sir Calidore was _easy gear_,\" _i.e._ an easy matter,\nfairly, softly. _Fair_ and _softly_ were two words which went together,\nsignifying _gently_ (Warton).\n\n170. ~mine ear ... My best guide~. Observe the juxtaposition of _mine_ and\n_my_ in these lines. _Mine_ is frequent before a vowel, especially when\nthe possessive adjective is not emphatic. In Shakespeare 'mine' is\nalmost always found before \"eye,\" \"ear,\" etc., where no emphasis is\nintended (Abbott, \u00c2\u00a7 237).\n\n171. ~Methought~, _i.e._ it seemed to me. In the verb 'methinks' _me_ is\nthe dative, and _thinks_ is an impersonal verb (A.S. _thincan_, to\nappear), quite distinct from the causal verb 'I think,' which is from\nA.S. _thencan_, to make to appear.\n\n173. ~jocund~, merry. Comp. _L'Allegro_, 94, \"the _jocund_ rebecks sound.\"\n~gamesome~, lively. This word, like many other adjectives in _-some_, is\nnow less common than it was in Elizabethan English: many such adjectives\nare obsolete, _e.g._ laboursome, joysome, quietsome, etc. (see Trench's\n_English, Past and Present_, v.).\n\n174. ~unlettered hinds~, ignorant rustics (A.S. _hina_, a domestic).\n\n175. ~granges~, granaries, barns (Lat. _granum_, grain). The word is now\napplied to a farm-house with its outhouses.\n\n176. ~Pan~, the god of everything connected with pastoral life: see _Arc._\n106, \"Though Syrinx your Pan's mistress were.\"\n\n177. ~thank the gods amiss~. _Amiss_ stands for M.E. _on misse_ = in\nerror. \"Perhaps there is a touch of Puritan rigour in this. The gods\nshould be thanked in solemn acts of devotion, and not by merry-making\"\n(Keightley). See Introduction.\n\n178. ~swilled insolence~, etc., _i.e._ the drunken rudeness of those\ncarousing at this late hour. _Swill_: to swill is to drink greedily,\nhence to drink like a pig. ~wassailers~; from 'wassail' [A.S. _waes hael_;\nfrom _wes_, be thou, and _h\u00c3\u00a1l_, whole (modern English _hale_)], a form\nof salutation, used in drinking one's health; and hence employed in the\nsense of 'revelling' or 'carousing.' The 'wassail-bowl' here referred to\nis the \"spicy nutbrown ale\" of _L'Allegro_, 100. In Scott's _Ivanhoe_,\nthe Friar drinks to the Black Knight with the words, \"_Waes hale_, Sir\nSluggish Knight,\" the Knight replying \"Drink _hale_, Holy Clerk.\"\n\n180. ~inform ... feet~. Comp. _Sams. Agon._ 335: \"hither hath _informed_\nyour younger _feet_.\" This use of 'inform' (= direct) is well\nillustrated in Spenser's _F. Q._ vi. 6: \"Which with sage counsel, when\nthey went astray, He could _enforme_, and then reduce aright.\"\n\n184. ~spreading favour~. Epithet transferred from cause to effect.\n\n187. ~kind hospitable woods~: an instance of the pathetic fallacy which\nattributes to inanimate objects the feelings of men: comp. ll. 194, 195.\n_As_ in this line (after _such_) has the force of a relative pronoun.\n\n188. ~grey-hooded Even~. Comp. \"sandals grey,\" _Lyc._ 187; \"civil-suited,\"\n_Il Pens._ 122; both applied to morning.\n\n189. ~a sad votarist~, etc. A votarist is one who is bound by a vow (Lat.\n_votum_): the current form is _votary_, applied in a general sense to\none _devoted_ to an object, _e.g._ a votary of science. In the present\ncase, the votarist is a _palmer_, _i.e._ a pilgrim who carried a\npalm-branch in token of his having been to Palestine. Such would\nnaturally wear sober-coloured or homely garments: comp. Drayton, \"a\npalmer poor in homely russet clad.\" In _Par. Reg._ xiv. 426, Morning is\na pilgrim clad in \"amice grey.\" On ~weed~, see note, l. 16.\n\n190. ~hindmost wheels~: comp. l. 95: \"If this fine image is optically\nrealised, what we see is Evening succeeding Day as the figure of a\nvenerable grey-hooded mendicant might slowly follow the wheels of some\nrich man's chariot\" (Masson).\n\n192. ~labour ... thoughts~, the burden of my thoughts.\n\n193. ~engaged~, committed: this use of the word may be compared with that\nin _Hamlet_, iii. 3. 69, \"Art more _engaged_\" (= bound or entangled). To\n_engage_ is to bind by a _gage_ or pledge.\n\n195. ~stole~, stolen. This use of the past form for the participle is\nfrequent in Elizabethan English. ~Else~, etc. The meaning is: 'The envious\ndarkness must have stolen my brothers, _otherwise_ why should night hide\nthe light of the stars?' The clause 'but for some felonious end' is\ntherefore to some extent tautological.\n\n197. ~dark lantern~. The stars by a far-fetched metaphor are said to be\nconcealed, though not extinguished, just as the light of a dark lantern\nis shut off by a slide. Comp. More; \"Vice is like a _dark lanthorn_,\nwhich turns its bright side only to him that bears it.\"\n\n198. ~everlasting oil~. Comp. _F. Q._ i. 1. 57:\n\n    \"By this the eternal lamps, wherewith high Jove\n    Doth light the lower world, were half yspent:\"\n\nalso _Macbeth_, ii. 1. 5, \"There's husbandry in heaven; Their candles\nare all out.\" There is here an irregularity of syntax. \"That Nature hung\nin heaven\" is a relative clause co-ordinate _in sense_ with the next\nclause; but by a change of thought the phrase \"and filled their lamps\"\nis treated as a principal clause, and a new object is introduced: comp.\nl. 6.\n\n203. ~rife~, prevalent. ~perfect~, distinct; see note, l. 73.\n\n204. ~single darkness~, darkness only. _Single_ is from the same base as\n_simple_; comp. l. 369.\n\n205. ~What might this be?~ This is a direct question about a past event,\nand has the same meaning as \"what should it be?\" in line 482: see note\nthere. ~A thousand fantasies~, etc. On this, passage Lowell says: \"That\nwonderful passage in _Comus_ of the airy tongues, perhaps the most\nimaginative in suggestion he ever wrote, was conjured out of a dry\nsentence in Purchas's abstract of Marco Polo. Such examples help us to\nunderstand the poet.\" Reference may also be made to the _Anat. of Mel._:\n\"Fear makes our imagination conceive what it list, ... and tyrannizeth\nover our fantasy more than all other affections, especially in the\ndark\"; also to the song prefixed to the same work, \"My phantasie\npresents a thousand ugly shapes,\" etc. On the power of imagination or\nphantasy, Shakespeare says:\n\n                      \"As imagination bodies forth\n    The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen\n    Turns them to _shapes_, and gives to _airy nothing_\n    A local habitation and a name.\"--\n\n    _M. N. D._ v. 1. 14.\n\nCompare also Ben Jonson's _Vision of Delight_:\n\n    \"Break, Phant'sie, from thy cave of cloud,\n    And spread thy purple wings;\n    Now all thy figures are allow'd,\n    And various shapes of things:\n    Create of _airy forms_ a stream ...\n    And though it be a waking dream,\" etc.\n\n207. ~Of calling shapes~, etc. In Heywood's _Hierarchy of Angels_ there is\na reference to travellers seeing strange shapes beckoning to them. Such\nwords as 'shapes,' 'shadows,' 'airy tongues,' etc., illustrate Milton's\npower to create an indefinite, yet expressive picture. Comp. _Aen._ iv.\n460. ~beckoning shadows dire~. A characteristic arrangement of words in\nMilton: comp. lines 470, 945.\n\n208. ~syllable~, pronounce distinctly.\n\n210. ~may startle well~, may well startle.\n\n212. ~siding champion, Conscience~. To side is to take a side, and hence\nto assist: comp. _Cor._ iv. 2. 2: \"The nobles who have _sided_ in his\nbehalf.\" 'Conscience' (here a trisyllable) is used in its current sense:\nin _Son._ xxii. 10 it means consciousness. Comp. _Hen. VIII._ iii. 2.\n379: \"A peace above all earthly dignities, A still and quiet\nConscience.\"\n\n213. ~pure-eyed Faith~. Comp. _Lyc._ 81, \"those pure eyes And perfect\nwitness of all-judging Jove\"; also the Scriptural words, \"God is of\npurer eyes than to behold iniquity.\" The maiden, whose safeguard is her\npurity, calls on Faith, Hope, and Chastity, each being characterised by\nan epithet denoting purity of thought and act, viz. 'pure-eyed,'\n'white-handed,' and 'unblemished.' The placing of Chastity instead of\nCharity in the trio is significant: see i. _Cor._ xiii.\n\n214. ~hovering angel~. Hope hovers over the maiden to protect her. The\nword 'hover' is found frequently in the sense of 'shelter.' girt,\nsurrounded. ~golden wings~. In _Il Pens._ 52, Contemplation \"soars on\ngolden wing.\"\n\n216. ~see ye visibly~, _i.e._ you are not mere shapes, but living\npresences. _Ye_: here the object of the verb. \"This confusion between\n_ye_ and _you_ did not exist in old English; _ye_ was always used as a\nnominative, and _you_ as a dative or accusative. In the English Bible\nthe distinction is very carefully observed, but in the dramatists of the\nElizabethan period there is a very loose use of the two forms\" (Morris).\nIt is so in Milton, who has _ye_ as nominative, accusative, and dative;\ncomp. lines 513, 967, 1020; also _Arc._ 40, 81, 101. It may be noted\nthat _ye_ can be pronounced more rapidly than _you_, and is therefore\nfrequent when an unaccented syllable is required.\n\n217. ~the Supreme Good~. God being the Supreme Good, if evil exists, it\nmust exist for God's purposes. Evil exists for the sake of 'vengeance'\nor punishment.\n\n219. ~glistering guardian~, _i.e._ one clad in the 'pure ambrosial weeds'\nof l. 16. _Glister_, _glisten_, _glitter_, and _glint_ are cognate\nwords.\n\n221. ~Was I deceived~? There is a break in the construction at the end of\nline 220. The girl's trust in Heaven is suddenly strengthened by a\nglimpse of light in the dark sky. Warton regards the repetition of the\nsame words in lines 223, 224 as beautifully expressing the confidence of\nan unaccusing conscience.\n\n222. ~her~ = its. In Latin _nubes_, a cloud, is feminine.\n\n223. ~does ... turn ... and casts~. Comp. _Il Pens._ 46, 'doth diet' and\n'hears.' When two co-ordinate verbs are of the same tense and mood the\nauxiliary verb should apply to both. The above construction is due\nprobably to change of thought.\n\n225. ~tufted grove~. Comp. _L'Alleg._ 78: \"bosomed high in _tufted_\ntrees.\"\n\n226. ~hallo~. Also _hallow_ (as in Milton's editions), _halloo_, _halloa_,\nand _holloa_.\n\n227. ~make to be heard~. Make = cause.\n\n228. ~new-enlivened spirits~, _i.e._ my spirits that have been newly\nenlivened: for the form of the compound adjective comp. note, l. 36.\n\n229. ~they~, _i.e._ the brothers.\n\n230. ~Echo~. In classical mythology she was a nymph whom Juno punished by\npreventing her from speaking before others or from being silent after\nothers had spoken. She fell in love with Narcissus, and pined away until\nnothing remained of her but her voice. Compare the invocation to Echo in\nBen Jonson's _Cynthia's Revels_, i. 1.\n\nThe lady's song, which has been described as \"an address to the very\nGenius of Sound,\" is here very naturally introduced. The lady wishes to\nrouse the echoes of the wood in order to attract her brothers' notice,\nand she does so by addressing Echo, who grieves for the lost youth\nNarcissus as the lady grieves for her lost brothers.\n\n231. ~thy airy shell~; the atmosphere. Comp. \"the hollow round of\nCynthia's seat,\" _Hymn Nat._ 103. The marginal reading in the MS. is\n_cell_. Some suppose that 'shell' is here used, like Lat. _concha_,\nbecause in classical times various musical instruments were made in the\nform of a shell.\n\n232. ~Meander's margent green~. Maeander, a river of Asia Minor,\nremarkable for the windings of its course; hence the verb 'to meander,'\nand hence also (in Keightley's opinion) the mention of the river as a\nhaunt of Echo. It is more probable, however, that, as the lady addresses\nEcho as the \"Sweet Queen of Parley\" and the unhappy lover of the lost\nNarcissus, the river is here mentioned because of its associations with\nmusic and misfortune. The Marsyas was a tributary of the Maeander, and\nthe legend was that the flute upon which Marsyas played in his rash\ncontest with Apollo was carried into the Maeander and, after being\nthrown on land, dedicated to Apollo, the god of song. Comp. _Lyc._\n58-63, where the Muses and misfortune are similarly associated by a\nreference to Orpheus, whose 'gory visage' and lyre were carried \"down\nthe swift Hebrus to the Lesbian shore.\" Further, the Maeander is\nassociated with the sorrows of the maiden Byblis, who seeks her lost\nbrother Caunus (called by Ovid _Maeandrius juvenis_). [Since the above\nwas written, Prof. J. W. Hales has given the following explanation of\nMilton's allusion: \"The real reason is that the Meander was a famous\nhaunt of swans, and the swan was a favourite bird with the Greek and\nLatin writers--one to whose sweet singing they perpetually allude\"\n(_Athenaeum_, April 20, 1889).] 'Margent.' _Marge_ and _margin_ are\nforms of the same word.\n\n233. ~the violet-embroidered vale~. The notion that flowers _broider_ or\nornament the ground is common in poetry: comp. _Par. Lost_, iv. 700:\n\"Under foot the violet, Crocus, and hyacinth, with rich inlay\n_Broidered_ the ground.\" In _Lyc._ 148, the flowers themselves wear\n'embroidery.' The nightingale is made to haunt a violet-embroidered vale\nbecause these flowers are associated with love (see Jonson's _Masque of\nHymen_) and with innocence (see _Hamlet_, iv. 5. 158: \"I would give you\nsome violets, but they withered all when my father died\"). Prof. Hales,\nhowever, thinks that some particular vale is here alluded to, and\nargues, with much acumen, that the poet referred to the woodlands close\nby Athens to the north-west, through which the Cephissus flowed, and\nwhere stood the birthplace of Sophocles, who sings of his native Colonus\nas frequented by nightingales. The same critic regards the epithet\n'violet-embroidered' as a translation of the Greek \u00e1\u00bc\u00b0\u00ce\u00bf\u00cf\u0083\u00cf\u0084\u00e1\u00bd\u00b3\u00cf\u0086\u00ce\u00b1\u00ce\u00bd\u00ce\u00bf\u00cf\u0082\n(= crowned with violets), frequently applied by Aristophanes to Athens,\nof which Colonus was a suburb. Macaulay also refers to Athens as \"the\nviolet-crowned city.\" It is, at least, very probable that Milton might\nhere associate the nightingale with Colonus, as he does in _Par. Reg._\niv. 245: see the following note.\n\n234. ~love-lorn nightingale~, the nightingale whose loved ones are lost:\ncomp. Virgil, _Georg._ iv. 511: \"As the nightingale wailing in the\npoplar shade plains for her lost young, ... while she weeps the night\nthrough, and sitting on a bough, reproduces her piteous melody, and\nfills the country round with the plaints of her sorrow.\" _Lorn_ and\n_lost_ are cognate words, the former being common in the compound\n_forlorn_: see note, l. 39. Milton makes frequent allusion to the\nnightingale: in _Il Penseroso_ it is 'Philomel'; in _Par. Reg._ iv. 245,\nit is 'the Attic bird'; and in _Par. Lost_ viii. 518, it is 'the amorous\nbird of night.' He calls it the Attic bird in allusion to the story of\nPhilomela, the daughter of Pandion, King of Athens. Near the Academy was\nColonus, which Sophocles has celebrated as the haunt of nightingales\n(Browne). Philomela was changed, at her own prayer, into a nightingale\nthat she might escape the vengeance of her brother-in-law Tereus. The\nepithet 'love-lorn,' however, seems to point to the legend of A\u00c4\u0093don\n(Greek \u00e1\u00bc\u0080\u00ce\u00b7\u00ce\u00b4\u00e1\u00bd\u00bd\u00ce\u00bd, a nightingale), who, having killed her own son by mistake,\nwas changed into a nightingale, whose mournful song was represented by\nthe Greek poets as the lament of the mother for her child.\n\n235. ~her sad song mourneth~, _i.e._ sings her plaintive melody. 'Sad\nsong' forms a kind of cognate accusative.\n\n237. ~likest thy Narcissus~. Narcissus, who failed to return the love of\nEcho, was punished by being made to fall in love with his own image\nreflected in a fountain: this he could never approach, and he\naccordingly pined away and was changed into the flower which bears his\nname. See the dialogue between Mercury and Echo in _Cynthia's Revels_,\ni. 1. Grammatically, _likest_ is an adjective qualified adverbially by\n\"(to) thy Narcissus\": comp. _Il Pens._ 9, \"likest hovering dreams.\"\n\n238. ~have hid~. This is not a grammatical inaccuracy (as Warton thinks),\nbut the subjunctive mood.\n\n240. ~Tell me but where~, _i.e._ 'Only tell me where.'\n\n241. ~Sweet Queen of Parley~, etc. 'Parley is conversation (Fr. _parler_,\nto speak): _parlour_, _parole_, _palaver_, _parliament_, _parlance_.\netc., are cognate. ~Daughter of the Sphere~, _i.e._ of the sphere which is\nher \"airy shell\" (l. 231): comp. \"Sphere-born harmonious sisters, Voice\nand Verse\" (_At a Solemn Music_, 2).\n\n243. ~give resounding grace~, etc., _i.e._ add the charm of echo to the\nmusic of the spheres.\n\nThe metrical structure of this song should be noted: the lines vary in\nlength from two to six feet. The rhymes are few, and the effect is more\nstriking owing to the consonance of _shell_, _well_ with _vale_,\n_nightingale_; also of _pair_, _where_ with _are_ and _sphere_; and of\n_have_ with _cave_. Masson regards this song as a striking illustration\nof Milton's free use of imperfect rhymes, even in his most musical\npassages.\n\n244. ~mortal mixture ... divine enchanting ravishment~. The words _mortal_\nand _divine_ are in antithesis: comp. _Il Pens._ 91, 92, \"The immortal\nmind that hath forsook Her mansion in this fleshly nook.\" The lines\nembody a compliment to the Lady Alice: read in this connection lines 555\nand 564. 'Ravishment,' rapture (a cognate word) or ecstasy: comp. _Il\nPens._ 40, \"Thy rapt soul sitting in thine eyes\"; also l. 794.\n\n246. ~Sure~, used adverbially: comp. line 493, and 'certain,' l. 266.\n\n247. ~vocal~, used proleptically.\n\n248. ~his~ = its: see note, l. 96. The pronoun refers to 'something holy.'\n\n251. ~smoothing the raven down~. As the nightingale's song smooths the\nrugged brow of Night (_Il Pens._ 58), so here the song of the lady\nsmooths the raven plumage of darkness. In classical mythology Night is a\nwinged goddess.\n\n252. ~it~, _i.e._ darkness.\n\n253. ~Circe ... Sirens three~. In the _Odyssey_ the Sirens are two in\nnumber and have no connection with Circe. They lived on a rocky island\noff the coast of Sicily and near the rock of Scylla (l. 257), and lured\nsailors to destruction by the charm of their song. Circe was also a\nsweet singer and had the power of enchanting men; hence the combined\nallusion: see also Horace's _Epist._ i. 2, 23, _Sirenum voces, et Circes\npocula n\u00c3\u00b4sti_. Besides, the Sirens were daughters of the river-god\nAchelous, and Circe had Naiads or fountain-nymphs among her maids.\n\n254. ~flowery-kirtled Naiades~: fresh-water nymphs dressed in flowers, or\nhaving their skirts decorated with flowers. A _kirtle_ is a gown; Skeat\nsuggests that it is a diminutive of _skirt_.\n\n255. ~baleful~, injurious (A.S. _balu_, evil).\n\n256. ~sung~. \"The verbs _swim_, _begin_, _run_, _drink_, _shrink_, _sink_,\n_ring_, _sing_, _spring_, have for their proper past tenses _swam_,\n_began_, _ran_, etc., preserving the original _a_; but in older writers\n(sixteenth and seventeenth centuries) and in colloquial English we find\nforms with _u_, which have come from the passive participles.\" (Morris).\n~take the prisoned soul~, _i.e._ would take the soul prisoner; 'prisoned'\nbeing used proleptically.\n\n257. ~lap it in Elysium~. _Lap_ is a form of wrap: comp. _L'Alleg._ 136,\n\"_Lap_ me in soft Lydian airs.\" Elysium: the abode of the spirits of the\nblessed; comp. _L'Alleg._ 147, \"heaped Elysian flowers.\" ~Scylla ...\nCharybdis~. The former, a rival of Circe in the affections of the sea-god\nGlaucus, was changed into a monster, surrounded by barking dogs. She\nthrew herself into the sea and became a rock, the noise of the\nsurrounding waves (\"multis circum latrantibus undis,\" _Aen._ vii. 588)\nresembling the barking of dogs. The latter was a daughter of Poseidon,\nand was hurled by Zeus into the sea, where she became a whirlpool.\n\n260. ~slumber~: comp. _Pericles_, v. 1. 335, \"thick slumber Hangs upon\nmine eyes.\"\n\n261. ~madness~, ecstasy. The same idea is expressed in _Il Pens._ 164: \"As\nmay with sweetness, through mine ear, Dissolve me into _ecstasies_, And\nbring all heaven before mine eyes.\" In Shakespeare 'ecstasy' occurs in\nthe sense of madness; see _Hamlet_, iii. 1. 167, \"That unmatched form\nand feature of blown youth, Blasted with _ecstasy_\"; _Temp._ iii. 3.\n108, \"hinder them from what this _ecstasy_ May now provoke them to\":\ncomp. also \"the pleasure of that madness,\" _Wint. Tale_, v. 3. 73. See\nalso l. 625.\n\n262. ~home-felt~, deeply felt. Compare \"The _home_ thrust of a friendly\nsword is sure\" (Dryden); \"This is a consideration that comes _home_ to\nour interest\" (Addison): see also Index to Globe _Shakespeare_.\n\n263. ~waking bliss~, as opposed to the ecstatic slumber induced by the\nsong of Circe.\n\n265. ~Hail, foreign wonder!~ Warton notes that _Comus_ is universally\nallowed to have taken some of its tints from the _Tempest_, and quotes,\n\"O you wonder! If you be maid, or no?\" i. 2. 426.\n\n266. ~certain~: see note, l. 246.\n\n267. ~Unless the goddess~, etc. = unless _thou be_ the goddess that in\nrural shrine _dwells_ here. Here, as often in Latin, we have 'unless'\n(Lat. _nisi_, etc.) used with a single word instead of a clause: and,\nalso as in Latin, the verb in the relative clause has the person of the\nantecedent.\n\n268. ~Pan or Sylvan~: see l. 176: also _Il Pens._ 134, \"shadows brown that\nSylvan loves,\" and _Arc._ 106, \"Though Syrinx your Pan's mistress were.\"\nSylvanus, the god of fields and forests, as denoted by his name which is\ncorrupted from Silvan (Lat. _silva_, a wood).\n\n269. ~Forbidding~, etc. These lines recall the language of _Arcades_, in\nwhich also a lady is complimented as \"a _deity_,\" \"a _rural_ Queen,\" and\n\"mistress of yon princely shrine\" in the land of Pan. There is a\nreference also to her protecting the woods through her servant, the\nGenius: _Arc._ 36-53, 91-95.\n\n271. ~ill is lost~. A Latin idiom (as Keightley points out) = _male\nperditur_: Prof. Masson, however, would regard it as equivalent to\n\"there is little loss in losing.\"\n\n273. ~extreme shift~; last resource. Comp. l. 617.\n\n274. ~my severed company~: a condensed expression = the companions\nseparated from me. Comp. l. 315: this figure of speech is called\nSynecdoche.\n\n277. ~What chance~, etc. In lines 277-290 we have a reproduction of that\nform of dialogue employed in Greek tragedy in which question and answer\noccupy alternate lines: it is called _stichomythia_, and is admirable\nwhen there is a gradual rise in excitement towards the end (as in the\n_Supplices_ of Euripides). In _Samson Agonistes_, which is modelled on\nthe Greek pattern, Milton did not employ it.\n\n278. An alliterative line.\n\n279. ~near ushering~, closely attending. To usher is to introduce (Lat.\n_ostium_, a door).\n\n284. ~twain~: thus frequently used as a predicate. It is also used after\nits substantive as in _Lyc._ 110, \"of metals _twain_,\" and as a\nsubstantive.\n\n285. ~forestalling~, anticipating. 'Forestall,' originally a marketing\nterm, is to buy up goods before they have been displayed at a _stall_ in\nthe market in order to sell them again at a higher price: hence 'to\nanticipate.' ~prevented~. 'Prevent,' now used in the sense of 'hinder,'\nseems in this line to have something of its older meaning, viz., to\nanticipate (in which case 'forestalling' would be proleptic). Comp. l.\n362; _Par. Lost_, vi. 129, \"half-way he met His daring foe, at this\n_prevention_ more Incensed.\"\n\n286. ~to hit~. This is the gerundial infinitive after an adjective: comp.\n\"good to eat,\" \"deadly to hear,\" etc.\n\n287. ~Imports their loss~, etc.: 'Apart from the present emergency, is the\nloss of them important?'\n\n289. ~manly prime~, etc.: 'Were they in the prime of manhood, or were they\nmerely youths?' With Milton the 'prime of manhood' is where 'youth'\nends: comp. _Par. Lost_, xi. 245, \"_prime_ in manhood where youth\nended\"; iii. 636, \"a stripling Cherub he appears, Not of the prime, yet\nsuch as in his face Youth smiled celestial.\" Spenser has 'prime' =\nSpring.\n\n290. ~Hebe~, the goddess of youth. \"The down of manhood\" had not appeared\non the lips of the brothers.\n\n291. ~what time~: common in poetry for 'when' (Lat. _quo tempore_).\nCompare Horace, _Od._ iii. 6: \"what time the sun shifted the shadows of\nthe mountains, and took the yokes from the wearied oxen.\" ~laboured~:\nwearied with labour.\n\n292. ~loose traces~. Because no longer taut from the draught of the\nplough.\n\n293. ~swinked~, overcome with toil, fatigued (A.S. _swincan_, to toil).\nSkeat points out that this was once an extremely common word; the sense\nof toil is due to that of constant movement from the _swinging_ of the\nlabourer's arms. In Chaucer 'swinker' = ploughman.\n\n294. ~mantling~, spreading. To mantle is strictly to cloak or cover: comp.\n_Temp._ v. 1. 67, \"fumes that _mantle_ Their clearer reason.\"\n\n297. ~port~, bearing, mien.\n\n298. ~faery~. This spelling is nearer to that of the M.E. _faerie_ than\nthe current form.\n\n299. ~the element~; the air. Since the time of the Greek philosopher\nEmpedocles, fire, earth, air, and water have been popularly called the\nfour elements; when used alone, however, 'the element' commonly means\n'the air.' Comp. _Hen. V._ iv. 1. 107, \"The _element_ shows him as it\ndoth to me\"; _Par. Lost_, ii. 490, \"the louring _element_ Scowls o'er\nthe darkened landscape snow or shower,\" etc.\n\n301. ~plighted~, interwoven or _plaited_. The verb 'plight' (or more\nproperly _plite_) is a variant of _plait_: see _Il Pens._ 57, \"her\nsweetest saddest _plight_.\" The word has no connection with 'plight,' l.\n372. ~awe-strook~. Milton uses three forms of the participle, viz.\n'strook,' 'struck,' and 'strucken.'\n\n302. ~worshiped~. The final consonant is now doubled in such verbs before\n_-ed_.\n\n303. ~were~ = would be: subjunctive. ~like the path to Heaven~; _i.e._ it\nwould be a pleasure to help, etc. There is (probably) no allusion to the\nScripture parable of the narrow and difficult way to Heaven (_Matt._\nvii.) as in _Son._ ix., \"labours up the hill of heavenly Truth.\"\n\n304. ~help you find~: comp. l. 623. The simple infinitive is here used\nwithout _to_ where _to_ would now be inserted. This omission of the\npreposition now occurs with so few verbs that 'to' is often called the\nsign of the infinitive, but in Early English the only sign of the\ninfinitive was the termination _en_ (_e.g._ he can _speken_). The\ninfinitive, being used as a noun, had a dative form called the gerund,\nwhich was preceded by the preposition _to_, and when this became\nconfused with the simple infinitive the use of _to_ became general.\nComp. _Son._ xx. 4, \"_Help_ waste a sullen day.\"\n\n305. ~readiest way~. Here 'readiest' logically belongs to the predicate.\n\n311. ~each ... every~: see note, l. 19. ~alley~, a walk or avenue.\n\n312. ~Dingle ... bushy dell ... bosky bourn~. 'Dingle' = dimble (see Ben\nJonson's _Sad Shepherd_) = dimple = a little dip or depression; hence a\nnarrow valley. 'Dell' = dale, literally a cleft; hence a valley, not so\ndeep as a dingle. 'Bosky bourn,' a stream whose banks are bushy or\nthickly grown with bushes. 'Bourn,' a boundary, is a distinct word\netymologically, but the phrase \"from side to side,\" as used by Comus,\nmight well imply that the valley as well as the stream is here referred\nto. 'Bosky,' bushy. The noun 'boscage' = jungle or _bush_ (M.E. _busch_,\n_bush_, _bush_). 'See Tennyson's _Dream of F. W._ 243, \"the sombre\n_boscage_ of the wood.\"\n\n315. ~stray attendance~ = strayed attendants; abstract for concrete, as in\nline 274. Comp. _Par. Lost_, x. 80, \"_Attendance_ none shall need, nor\ntrain\"; xii. 132, \"Of herds, and flocks, and numerous _servitude_\" (=\nservants).\n\n316. ~shroud~, etc. Milton first wrote \"within these shroudie limits\": see\nnote, l. 147.\n\n317. ~low-roosted lark~, _i.e._ the lark that has roosted on the ground.\nThis is certainly Milton's meaning, as he refers to the bird as rising\nfrom its \"thatched pallet\" = its nest, which is built on the ground.\n'Roost' has, however, no radical connection with _rest_, but denotes a\nperch for fowls, and Keightley's remark that Milton is guilty of\nsupposing the lark to sleep, like a hen, upon a perch or roost, may\ntherefore be noticed. But the poets' meaning is obvious. Prof. Masson\ntakes 'thatched' as referring to the texture of the nest or to the\ncorn-stalks or rushes over it.\n\n318. ~rouse~. Here used intransitively = awake.\n\n322. ~honest-offered~: see notes, ll. 36, 228.\n\n323. ~sooner~, more readily.\n\n324. ~tapestry halls~. Halls hung with tapestry, tapestry being \"a kind of\ncarpet work, with wrought figures, especially used for decorating\nwalls.\" The word is said to be from the Persian.\n\n325. ~first was named~. The meaning is: '_Courtesy_ which is derived from\n_court_, and which is still nominally most common in high life, is\nnevertheless most readily found amongst those of humble station.' This\nsentiment is becoming in the mouth of Lady Alice when addressed to a\nhumble shepherd. 'Courtesy' (or, as Milton elsewhere writes,\n_courtship_) has, like _civility_, lost much of its deeper significance.\nComp. Spenser, _F. Q._ vi. 1. 1:\n\n    \"Of Court it seems men Courtesy do call,\n    For that it there most useth to abound.\"\n\n327. ~less warranted~, _i.e._ when I have less _guarantee_ of safety.\n_Guarantee_ and _warrant_, like _guard_ and _ward_, _guile_ and _wile_,\nare radically the same.\n\n329. ~Eye me~, _i.e._ look on me. To _eye_ a person now usually implies\nwatching narrowly or suspiciously. ~square~, accommodate, adjust. The adj.\n'proportioned' is here used proleptically, denoting the result of the\naction indicated by the verb 'square.' Comp. _M. for M._ v. 1: \"Thou 'rt\nsaid to have a stubborn soul, ... And _squar'st_ thy life accordingly.\"\n~Exeunt~, _i.e._ they go out, they leave the stage.\n\n331. ~Unmuffle~, uncover yourselves. To _muffle_ is to cover up, _e.g._\n'to _muffle_ the throat,' 'a _muffled_ sound,' etc. _Muffle_ (subst.) is\na diminutive of _muff_.\n\n332. ~wont'st~, _i.e._ art wont. _Wont'st_ is here apparently the 2nd\nperson singular, present tense, of a verb _to wont_ = to be accustomed;\nhence also the participle _wonted_ (_Il Pens._ 37, \"keep thy _wonted_\nstate\"). But the M.E. verb was _wonen_, to dwell or be accustomed, and\nits participle _woned_ or _wont_. The fact that _wont_ was a participle\nbeing forgotten, it was treated as a distinct verb, and a new participle\nformed, viz., _wonted_ (= won-ed-ed); from this again comes the noun\n_wontedness_. Milton, however, uses _wont_ as a present only twice in\nhis poetry: as in modern English he uses it as a noun (= custom) or as a\nparticipial adj. with the verb _to be_ (_Il Pens._ 123, \"As she was\nwont\"). ~benison~, blessing: radically the same as 'benediction' (Lat.\n_benedictio_).\n\n333. ~Stoop thy pale visage~, etc. Comp. l. 1023 and _Il Pens._ 72,\n\"_Stooping_ through a fleecy cloud.\" 'Visage,' a word now mostly used\nwith a touch of contempt, in Milton simply denotes 'face': see _Il\nPens._ 13, \"saintly _visage_\"; _Lyc._ 62, \"His gory _visage_ down the\nstream was sent.\" ~amber~: comp. _L'Alleg._ 61, \"Robed in flames and\n_amber_ light,\" and Tennyson:\n\n    \"What time the _amber_ morn\n    Forth gushes from beneath a low-hung cloud.\"\n\n334. ~disinherit~, drive out, dispossess. Comp. _Two Gent._ iii. 2. 87,\n\"This or else nothing, will _inherit_ (_i.e._ obtain possession of)\nher.\"\n\n336. ~Influence ... dammed up~. The verb here shows that influence is\nemployed in its strict sense, = a flowing in (Lat. _in_ and _fluo_): it\nwas thus used in astrology to denote \"an _influent_ course of the\nplanets, their virtue being infused into, or their course working on,\ninferior creatures\"; comp. _L'Alleg._ 112, \"whose bright eyes Rain\n_influence_\"; _Par. Lost_, iv. 669, \"with kindly heat Of various\n_influence_.\" Astrology has left many traces upon the English language,\n_e.g._ influence, disastrous, ill-starred, ascendant, etc. See also l.\n360.\n\n337. ~taper~; here a vocative, the verb being \"visit (thou).\"\n\n338. ~though a rush candle~, _i.e._ 'though it be only a rush-candle'; a\nrush light, obtained from the pith of a rush dipped in oil.\n\n340. ~long levelled rule~; straight horizontal beam of light: comp. _Par.\nLost_, iv. 543, \"the setting sun ... _Levelled_ his evening rays.\" The\ninstrument with which straight lines are drawn is called a _rule_ or\nruler.\n\n341. ~star of Arcady Or Tyrian Cynosure~; here put by synecdoche for\n'lode-star.' More particularly, the star of Arcady signifies any of the\nstars in the constellation of the Great Bear, by which Greek sailors\nsteered; and 'Tyrian Cynosure' signifies the stars comprising that part\nof the constellation of the Lesser Bear which, from its shape, was\ncalled _Cynosura_, the dog's tail (Greek \u00ce\u00ba\u00cf\u0085\u00ce\u00bd\u00e1\u00bd\u00b8\u00cf\u0082 \u00ce\u00bf\u00e1\u00bd\u0090\u00cf\u0081\u00e1\u00bd\u00b1), and by\nwhich Phoenician or Tyrian sailors steered. See _L'Alleg._ 80, \"The\n_cynosure_ of neighbouring eyes,\" where the word is used as a common\nnoun = point of attraction. Both constellations are connected in Greek\nmythology with the Arcadian nymph Callisto, who was turned by Zeus into\nthe Great Bear while her son Arcas became the Lesser Bear. Milton\nfollows the Roman poets in associating these stars with Arcadia on this\naccount.\n\n343. ~barred~, debarred or barred _from_.\n\n344. ~wattled cotes~: enclosures made of hurdles, _i.e._ frames of\nplaited twigs. _Cote_, _cot_, and _coat_ are varieties of the same word\n= a covering or enclosure.\n\n345. ~oaten stops~: see _Lyc._ 33, \"the _oaten_ flute\"; 88, \"But now my\n_oat_ proceeds\"; 188, \"the tender stops of various _quills_.\" The\nshepherd's pipe, being at first a row of oaten stalks, \"the oaten pipe,\"\n\"oat,\" etc., came to denote any instrument of this kind and even to\nsignify \"pastoral poetry.\" The 'stops' are the holes over which the\nplayer's fingers are placed, also called vent-holes or \"ventages\"\n(_Ham._ iii. 2. 372). See also note on 'azurn,' l. 893.\n\n346. ~whistle ... lodge~, _i.e._ the sound of the shepherd calling his dog\nby whistling. Or it may be used in the same sense as in _L'Alleg._ 63,\n\"the ploughman _whistles_ o'er the furrowed land.\"\n\n347. ~Count ... dames~: comp. _L'Alleg._ 52, \"the cock ... Stoutly struts\nhis _dames_ before\"; 114, \"Ere the first cock his matin rings.\"\nGrammatically, 'count' (infinitive) forms with 'cock' the complex object\nof 'might hear.'\n\n349. ~innumerous~, innumerable (Lat. _innumerus_). Comp. _Par. Lost_, vii.\n455, \"_Innumerous_ living creatures\"; ix. 1089.\n\n350. ~hapless~, unfortunate. Many words, such as happy, lucky, fortunate,\netc., which strictly refer to a person's hap or chance, whether good or\nbad, have become restricted to good hap: in order to give them an\nunfavourable meaning a negative prefix or suffix is necessary.\n\nWith reference to the word _fortune_, Max M\u00c3\u00bcller says: \"We speak of good\nand evil fortune, so did the French, and so did the Romans. By itself\n_fortuna_ was taken either in a good or a bad sense, though it generally\nmeant good fortune. Whenever there could be any doubt, the Romans\ndefined _fortuna_ by such adjectives as _bona_, _secunda_, _prospera_,\nfor good; _mala_ or _adversa_ for bad fortune ... _Fortuna_ came to mean\nsomething like chance.\"\n\n351. ~her~, herself. On the reflexive use of _her_, see note, l. 163.\n\n352. ~burs~; burrs, prickly seed-vessels of certain plants, _e.g._ the\nburr-thistle, the burdock (= the burr-dock), etc.\n\n355. ~leans~. As Milton frequently omits the nominative, we may supply\n_she_: otherwise _leans_ would be intransitive and its nominative\n'head': see note, l. 715. ~fraught~, freighted, filled. _Freight_ is\nitself a later form of _fraught_: in _Sams. Agon._, 1075, _fraught_ is a\nnoun (Ger. _fracht_, a load). See line 732.\n\n356. ~What~, etc. The ellipses may be supplied thus: \"What (shall be done)\nif (she be) in wild amazement?\"\n\n358. ~savage hunger~. 'Hunger' is put by synecdoche for hungry animals.\n\n359. ~over-exquisite~, _i.e._ too curious, over-inquisitive. _Exquisite_\nis here used in the sense of _inquisitive_; in modern English\n'exquisite' has a passive sense only, while 'inquisitive' has an active\nsense (Lat. _quaero_, to seek): see note, l. 714.\n\n\"The dialogue between the two brothers is an amicable contest between\nfact and philosophy. The younger draws his arguments from common\napprehension, and the obvious appearance of things; the elder proceeds\non a profounder knowledge, and argues from abstracted principles. Here\nthe difference of their ages is properly made subservient to a contrast\nof character\" (Warton).\n\n360. ~To cast the fashion~, _i.e._ to prejudge the form. 'To cast' was\ncommon in the sense of to calculate or compute; see Shakespeare, ii.\n_Henry IV._ i. 1. 166, \"You _cast_ the event of war.\" Some think,\nhowever, that the word has here its still more restricted sense as used\nin astrology, _e.g._ \"to _cast_ a nativity\"; others see in it a\nreference to the founder's art; and others to medical diagnosis.\n\n361. ~Grant they be so~: a concessive clause = granted that the evils turn\nout to be what you imagined. The alternative is given in l. 364.\n\n362. ~What need~, etc., _i.e._ why should a man anticipate his hour of\nsorrow. 'What' = for what (Lat. _quid_): comp. l. 752; also _On\nShakespeare_, 6, \"_What need'st_ thou such weak witness of thy name?\" On\nthe verb _need_ Abbott, \u00c2\u00a7 297, says: \"It is often found with 'what,'\nwhere it is sometimes hard to say whether 'what' is an adverb and 'need'\na verb, or 'what' an adjective and 'need' a noun. 'What need the bridge\nmuch broader than the flood?' _M. Ado_, i. 1. 318; either '_why need_\nthe bridge (be) broader?' or '_what need_ is there (that) the bridge\n(be) broader?'\"\n\n363. Compare Hamlet's famous soliloquy, \"rather bear those ills we\nhave,\" etc.; and Pope's _Essay on Man_, \"Heaven from all creatures hides\nthe book of fate,\" etc.\n\n366. ~to seek~, at a loss. Compare _Par. Lost_, viii. 197: \"Unpractised,\nunprepared, and still _to seek_.\" Bacon, in _Adv. of Learning_, has:\n\"Men bred in learning are perhaps _to seek_ in points of convenience.\"\n\n367. ~unprincipled in virtue's book~, _i.e._ ignorant of the elements of\nvirtue. A principle (Lat. _principium_, beginning) is a fundamental\ntruth; hence the current sense of 'unprincipled,' implying that the man\nwho has no fixed rules of life is the one who will readily fall into\nevil. Comp. _Sams. Agon._ 760, \"wisest and best men ... with goodness\n_principled_.\"\n\n368. ~bosoms~, holds within itself. The nom. is 'goodness.' 'Peace' is\ngoverned by 'in,' l. 367.\n\n369. ~As that~, etc. This is an adverbial clause of consequence to\n'unprincipled'; in modern English such a clause would be introduced by\n'that,' and in Elizabethan English either by 'as' or 'that.' Here we\nhave both connectives together. ~single~: see note, l. 204. noise, sound.\n\n370. ~Not being in danger~, _i.e._ she not being in danger: absolute\nconstruction. This parenthetical line is equivalent to a conditional\nclause--'if she be not in danger, the mere want of light and noise need\nnot disquiet her.'\n\n371. ~constant~, steadfast.\n\n372. ~misbecoming~: see note on 'misused,' l. 47. ~plight~, condition.\nSkeat derives this word from A.S. _pliht_, danger; others connect it with\n_pledge_. It is distinct from _plight_, l. 301.\n\n373. ~Virtue could see~, etc. The best commentary on this line is in lines\n381-5: comp. Spenser: \"Virtue gives herself light through darkness for\nto wade,\" _F. Q._ i. 1. 12.\n\n375. ~flat sea~: comp. _Lyc._ 98, \"level brine\": Lat. _aequor_, a flat\nsurface, used of the sea.\n\n376. ~seeks to~, applies herself to. This use of seek is common in the\nEnglish Bible: see _Deut._ xii. 5, \"_unto_ his habitation shall ye\n_seek_\"; _Isaiah_, viii. 19, xi. 10, xix. 3; i. _Kings_, x. 24.\n\n377. ~her best nurse, Contemplation~. The wise man loves contemplation and\nsolitude: comp. _Il Penseroso_, 51, where \"the Cherub Contemplation\" is\nthe \"first and chiefest\" of Melancholy's companions. In Sidney's\n_Arcadia_, \"Solitariness\" is \"the nurse of these contemplations.\"\n\n378. ~plumes~. Some would read _prunes_, both words being used of a bird's\nsmoothing or trimming its feathers--or (more strictly) picking out\ndamaged feathers. See Skeat's _Dictionary_, and compare Pope's line,\n\"Where Contemplation _prunes_ her ruffled wings.\"\n\n379. ~various~, varied: comp. l. 22. The 'bustle of resort' is in\n_L'Allegro_ the 'busy hum of men.'\n\n380. ~all to-ruffled~. Milton wrote \"all to ruffled,\" which may be\ninterpreted in various ways: (1) all to-ruffled, (2) all too ruffled,\n(3) all-to ruffled. The first of these is given in the text as it is\netymologically correct: _to_ is an intensive prefix as in 'to-break' =\nto break in pieces; 'to-tear' = to tear asunder, etc.; while _all_ (=\nquite) is simply an adverb modifying _to-ruffled_. But about 1500 A.D.\nthis idiom was misunderstood, and the prefix _to_ was detached from the\nverb and either read along with _all_ (thus all-to = altogether), or\nconfused with _too_ (thus all-to = too too, decidedly too). It is\ndoubtful in which sense Milton used the phrase; like Shakespeare, he may\nhave disregarded its origin. See Morris, \u00c2\u00a7 324; Abbott, \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 28, 436.\n\n381. ~He that has light~, etc. Comp. _Par. Lost_, i. 254: 'The mind is\nits own place,' etc.\n\n382. ~centre~, _i.e._ centre of the earth: comp. _Par. Lost_ i. 686, \"Men\nalso ... Ransacked the _centre_\"; and _Hymn Nat._ 162, \"The aged Earth\n... Shall from the surface to the _centre_ shake.\" Sometimes the word\n'centre' was used of the Earth itself, the _fixed_ centre of the whole\nuniverse according to the Ptolemaic system. The idea here conveyed,\nhowever, is not that of immovability (as in _Par. Reg._ iv. 534, \"as a\n_centre_ firm\") but of utter darkness.\n\n385. ~his own dungeon~: comp. _Sams. Agon._ 156, \"Thou art become (O worst\nimprisonment!) The _dungeon_ of thyself.\"\n\n386. ~most affects~: has the greatest liking for. It now generally denotes\nrather a feigned than a real liking: comp. _pretend_. Lines 386-392 may\nbe compared with _Il Pens._ 167-174.\n\n393. ~Hesperian tree~. An allusion to the tree on which grew the golden\napples of Juno, which were guarded by the Hesperides and the sleepless\ndragon Ladon. Hence the reference to the 'dragon watch': comp.\nTennyson's _Dream of Fair Women_, 255, \"Those dragon eyes of anger'd\nEleanor Do hunt me, day and night.\" See also ll. 981-983.\n\n395. ~unenchanted~, superior to all the powers of enchantment, not to be\nenchanted. Similarly Milton has 'unreproved' for 'not reprovable,'\n'unvalued' for 'invaluable,' etc.; and Shakespeare has 'unavoided' for\n'inevitable,' 'imagined' for 'imaginable,' etc. Abbott (\u00c2\u00a7 375) says: The\npassive participle is often used to signify, not that which _was_ and\n_is_, but that which _was_ and therefore _can be hereafter_; in other\nwords _-ed_ is used for _-able_.\n\n396. Compare Chaucer, _Doctor's Tale_, 44, \"She flowered in virginity,\nWith all humility and abstinence.\"\n\n398. ~unsunned~, hidden. Comp. _Cym._ ii. 5. 13, \"As chaste as _unsunned_\nsnow\"; _F. Q._ ii. 7, \"Mammon ... _Sunning_ his treasure hoar.\"\n\n400. ~as bid me hope~, etc. The construction is, 'as (you may) bid me (to)\nhope (that) Danger will wink on Opportunity and (that Danger will) let a\nsingle helpless maiden pass uninjured.'\n\n401. ~Danger will wink on~, etc., _i.e._ danger will shut its eyes to an\nopportunity. To _wink on_ or _wink at_ is to connive, to refuse to see\nsomething: comp. _Macbeth_, i. 4. 52, \"The eye _wink_ at the hand\";\n_Acts_, xvii. 30. Warton notes a similar argument by Rosalind in _As You\nLike It_, i. 3. 113: \"Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.\"\n\n403. ~surrounding~. Milton is said to be the first author of any note who\nuses this word in its current sense of 'encompassing,' which it has\nacquired through a supposed connection with _round_. Shakespeare does\nnot use it. Its original sense is 'to overflow' (Lat. _superundare_).\n\n404. ~it recks me not~, _i.e._ I do not heed: an impersonal use of the old\nverb _reck_ (A.S. _r\u00c3\u00a9can_, to care). Comp. _Lyc._ 122, \"What _recks_ it\nthem.\"\n\n405. ~dog them both~, _i.e._ follow closely upon night and loneliness.\nComp. _All's Well_, iii. 4. 15, \"death and danger _dogs_ the heels of\nworth.\"\n\n407. ~unown\u00c3\u00a8d~, _i.e._ 'thinking her to be unowned,' or 'as if unowned.'\nMilton thus, as in Latin, frequently condenses a clause into a\nparticiple.\n\n408. ~infer~, reason, argue. This use of the word is obsolete. See\nShakespeare, iii. _Hen. VI._ ii. 2. 44, \"_Inferring_ arguments of mighty\nforce\"; _K. John_, iii. 1. 213, \"Need must needs _infer_ this\nprinciple\": also _Par. Lost_, viii. 91, \"great or bright _infers_ not\nexcellence.\"\n\n409. ~without all doubt~, _i.e._ beyond all doubt: a Latinism = _sine omni\ndubitatione_.\n\n411. ~arbitrate the event~, judge of the result. The meaning is 'Where the\nresult depends equally upon circumstances to be hoped and to be dreaded\nI incline to hope.'\n\n413. ~squint suspicion~. Compare Quarles: \"Heart-gnawing Hatred, and\nsquint-eyed Suspicion.\" To look askance or sideways frequently indicates\nsuspicion.\n\n419. ~if Heaven gave it~, _i.e._ even _although_ Heaven gave it.\n\n420. ~'Tis chastity~. \"The passage which begins here and ends at line 475\nis a concentrated expression of the moral of the whole Masque, and an\nexposition also of a cardinal idea of Milton's philosophy\" (Masson).\n\n421. ~clad in complete steel~, _i.e._ completely armed; comp. _Hamlet_, i.\n4. 52, where the phrase occurs. The accent is on the first syllable.\n\n422. ~quivered nymph~. The chaste Diana of the Romans was armed with bow\nand quiver; and Shakespeare makes virginity \"Diana's livery.\" So in\nSpenser, Belphoebe, the personification of Chastity, has \"at her back a\nbow and quiver gay.\" 'Quivered' is the Latin _pharetrata_.\n\n423. ~trace~, traverse, track. ~unharboured~, affording no shelter.\nRadically, a harbour is a lodging or shelter.\n\n424. ~Inf\u00c3\u00a1mous~, having a bad name, ill-famed: a Latinism. The word now\nimplies disgrace or guilt. It is here accented on the penult.\n\n425. ~sacred rays~: comp. l. 782.\n\n426. ~bandite or mountaineer~. 'Bandite' (in Shakespeare _bandetto_, and\nnow _bandit_) is borrowed from the Italian _bandito_, outlawed or\n_banned_. 'Mountaineer,' here used in a bad sense. In modern English it\nhas reverted to its original sense--a dweller in mountains. The dwellers\nin mountains are often fierce and readily become freebooters: hence the\nchanges of meaning. See _Temp._ iii. 3. 44, \"Who would believe that\nthere were _mountaineers_ Dew-lapp'd like bulls\"; also _Cym._ iv. 2.\n120, \"Who called me traitor, _mountaineer_.\"\n\n428. ~very desolation~. Very (as an adj.) = true or real and may be traced\nto Lat. _verus_ = true: comp. l. 646.\n\n429. ~shagged ... shades~. 'Shagged' is rugged or shaggy, and 'horrid' is\nprobably used in the Latin sense of 'rough': see note, l. 38.\n\n430. ~unblenched~, undaunted, unflinching. This word, sometimes confounded\nwith 'unblanched,' is from _blench_, a causal of _blink_.\n\n431. ~Be it not~: a conditional clause = on condition that it be not.\n\n432. ~Some say~, etc. Compare _Hamlet_, i. 1. 158:\n\n    \"Some say that, ever against that season comes\n    Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,\n    The bird of dawning singeth all night long:\n    And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad.\"\n\n433. ~In fog or fire~, etc. Comp. _Il Pens._ 93, \"those demons that are\nfound In fire, air, flood, or underground\": an allusion to the different\norders and powers of demons as accepted in the Middle Ages. Burton, in\nhis _Anat. of Mel._, quotes from a writer who thus enumerates the kinds\nof sublunary spirits--\"fiery, aerial, terrestrial, watery, and\nsubterranean, besides fairies, satyrs, nymphs, etc.\"\n\n434. ~meagre hag~, lean witch. _Hag_ is from A.S. _haegtesse_, a\nprophetess or witch. Comp. _Par. Lost_, ii. 662; _M. W. of W._ iv. 2.\n188, \"Come down, you witch, you _hag_.\" ~unlaid ghost~, unpacified or\nwandering spirit. It was a superstition that ghosts left the world of\nspirits and wandered on the earth from the hour of curfew (see _Temp._\nv. 1. 40; _King Lear_, iii. 4. 120, \"This is the foul fiend\nFlibbertigibbet; he begins at curfew,\" etc.) until \"the first cock his\nmatin rings\" (_L'Alleg._ 14). 'Curfew' (Fr. _couvre-feu_ = fire-cover),\nthe bell that was rung at eight or nine o'clock in the evening as a\nsignal that all fires and lights were to be extinguished.\n\n436. ~swart faery of the mine~. In Burton's _Anat. of Mel._ we read,\n\"Subterranean devils are as common as the rest, and do as much harm.\nOlaus Magnus makes six kinds of them, some bigger, some less. These are\ncommonly seen about mines of metals,\" etc. Warton quotes from an old\nwriter: \"Pioneers or diggers for metal do affirm that in many mines\nthere appear strange shapes and spirits who are apparelled like unto the\nlabourers in the pit.\" 'Swart' (also _swarty_, _swarth_, and _swarthy_)\nhere means black: in Scandinavian mythology these subterranean spirits\nwere called the _Svartalfar_, or black elves. Comp. _Lyc._ 138, \"the\n_swart_ star,\" where 'swart' = swart making.\n\n438. ~Do ye believe~. _Ye_ is properly a second person plural, but (like\n_you_) is frequently used as a singular: for examples, see Abbott, \u00c2\u00a7\n236.\n\n439. ~old schools of Greece~. The brother now turns for his arguments from\nthe mediaeval mythology of Northern Europe to the ancient legends of\nGreece.\n\n440. ~to testify~, to bear witness to: comp. l. 248, 421.\n\n441. ~Dian~. Diana was the huntress among the immortals: she was\ninsensible to the bolts of Cupid, _i.e._ to the power of love. She was\nthe protectress of the flocks and game from beasts of prey, and at the\nsame time was believed to send plagues and sudden deaths among men and\nanimals. Comp. the song to Cynthia (Diana) in _Cynthia's Revels_, v. 1,\n\"Queen and huntress, chaste and fair,\" etc.\n\n442. ~silver-shafted queen~. The epithet is applicable to Diana both as\nhuntress and goddess of the moon: as the former she bore arrows which\nwere frequently called _shafts_, and as the latter she bore shafts or\nrays of light. _Shaft_ is etymologically 'a _shaven_ rod.' In Chaucer,\n_C. T._ 1364, 'shaft' = arrow.\n\n443. ~brinded lioness~. 'Brinded' = brindled or streaked. Comp. \"_brinded_\ncat,\" _Macb._ iv. 1. 1: _brind_ is etymologically connected with\n_brand_.\n\n444. ~mountain-pard~, _i.e._ panther or other spotted wild beast. _Pard_,\noriginally a Persian word, is common in the compounds leo-_pard_ and\ncamelo-_pard_.\n\n445. ~frivolous ... Cupid~. See the speech of Oberon, _M. N. D._ ii. 1.\n65. The epithet 'frivolous' applies to Cupid in his lower character as\nthe wanton god of sensual love, not in his character as the fair Eros\nwho unites all the discordant elements of the universe: see note, l.\n1004.\n\n447. ~snaky-headed Gorgon shield~. Medusa was one of the three Gorgons,\nfrightful beings, whose heads were covered with hissing serpents, and\nwho had wings, brazen claws, and huge teeth. Whoever looked at Medusa\nwas turned into stone, but Perseus, by the aid of enchantment, slew her.\nMinerva (Athene) placed the monster's head in the centre of her shield,\nwhich confounded Cupid: see _Par. Lost_, ii. 610.\n\n449. ~freezed~, froze. The adjective 'congealed' is used proleptically,\nthe meaning being 'froze into a stone so that it was congealed.'\n\n450. ~But~, except: a preposition.\n\n451. ~dashed~, confounded: this meaning of the word is obsolete.\n\n452. ~blank awe~: the awe of one amazed. Comp. the phrase, 'blank\nastonishment,' and see _Par. Lost_, ix. 890.\n\n454. ~so~, _i.e._ chaste.\n\n455. ~liveried angels lackey her~, _i.e._ ministering angels attend her.\nSo, in _L'Alleg._ 62, \"the clouds in thousand _liveries_ dight\"; a\nservant's livery being the distinctive dress _delivered_ to him by his\nmaster. 'Lackey,' to wait upon, from 'lackey' (or lacquey), a footboy,\nwho runs by the side of his master. The word is here used in a good\nsense, without implying servility (as in _Ant. and Cleop._ i. 4. 46,\n\"_lackeying_ the varying tide\"). 'Her': the soul. Milton is fond of the\nfeminine personification: see line 396.\n\n457. ~vision~: a trisyllable.\n\n458. ~no gross ear~. See notes, l. 112 and 997.\n\n459. ~oft converse~, frequent communion. _Oft_ is here used adjectively:\nthis use is common in the English Bible, _e.g._ i. _Tim._ v. 23, \"thine\n_often_ infirmities.\"\n\n460. ~Begin to cast ... turns~. 'Begin' is subjunctive; 'turns' is\nindicative: the latter may be used to convey greater certainty and\nvividness.\n\n461. ~temple of the mind~, _i.e._ the body. This metaphor is common: see\nShakespeare, _Temp._ i. 2. 57, \"There's nothing ill can dwell in such a\n_temple_\"; and the Bible, _John_, ii. 21, \"He spake of the _temple_ of\nhis body.\"\n\n462. ~the soul's essence~. As if, by a life of purity, the body gradually\nbecame spiritualised, and therefore partook of the soul's immortality.\n\n465. ~most~, above all.\n\n467. ~soul grows clotted~. This doctrine is expounded in Plato's _Phaedo_,\nin a conversation between Socrates and Cebes:\n\n     _Socrates_ (speaking of the pure soul). That soul, I say, herself\n     invisible, departs to the invisible world--to the divine and\n     immortal and rational: thither arriving, she is secure of bliss,\n     and is released from the error and folly of men, their fears and\n     wild passions and all other human ills, and for ever dwells, as\n     they say of the initiated, in company with the gods. Is not this\n     true, Cebes?\n\n     _Cebes._ Yes; beyond a doubt.\n\n     _Soc._ But the soul which has been polluted, and is impure at the\n     time of her departure, and is the companion and servant of the body\n     always, and is in love with and fascinated by the body and by the\n     desires and pleasures of the body, until she is led to believe that\n     the truth only exists in a bodily form, which a man may touch and\n     see and taste, and use for the purposes of his lusts--the soul, I\n     mean, accustomed to hate and fear and avoid the intellectual\n     principle, which to the bodily eye is dark and invisible and can be\n     attained only by philosophy;--do you suppose that such a soul will\n     depart pure and unalloyed?\n\n     _Ceb._ That is impossible.\n\n     _Soc._ She is held fast by the corporeal, which the continual\n     association and constant care of the body have wrought into her\n     nature.\n\n     _Ceb._ Very true.\n\n     _Soc._ And this corporeal element, my friend, is heavy and weighty\n     and earthy, and is that element by which such a soul is depressed\n     and dragged down again into the visible world, because she is\n     afraid of the invisible and of the world below--prowling about\n     tombs and sepulchres, in the neighbourhood of which, as they tell\n     us, are seen certain ghostly apparitions of souls which have not\n     departed pure, but are cloyed with sight and therefore visible.\n\n     _Ceb._ That is very likely, Socrates.\n\n     _Soc._ Yes, that is very likely, Cebes; and these must be the\n     souls, not of the good, but of the evil, who are compelled to\n     wander about such places in payment of the penalty of their former\n     evil way of life; and they continue to wander until through the\n     craving after the corporeal which never leaves them, they are\n     imprisoned finally in another body. And they may be supposed to\n     find their prisons in the same natures which they have had in their\n     former lives.\n\nFurther on in the same dialogue, Socrates says:\n\n     Each pleasure and pain is a sort of nail which nails and rivets the\n     soul to the body, until she becomes like the body, and believes\n     that to be true which the body affirms to be true; and from\n     agreeing with the body, and having the same delights, she is\n     obliged to have the same habits and haunts, and is not likely ever\n     to be pure at her departure, but is always infected by the\n     body.--_Extracted from Jowett's Translation of the Dialogues._\n\n468. ~imbodies and imbrutes~, _i.e._ becomes materialised and brutish.\n_Imbody_, ordinarily used as a transitive verb, is here intransitive.\n_Imbrute_ (said to have been coined by Milton) is also intransitive; in\n_Par. Lost_, ix. 166, it is transitive. The use of the word may have\nbeen suggested by the _Phaedo_, where the souls of the wicked are said\nto \"find their prisons in the same natures which they have had in their\nformer lives,\" those of gluttons and drunkards passing into asses and\nanimals of that sort.\n\n469. ~divine property~. In his prose works Milton calls the soul 'that\ndivine particle of God's breathing': comp. Horace, _Sat._ ii. 2. 79,\n\"affigit humo _divinae particulam aurae_\"; and Plato's _Phaedo_, \"The\nsoul resembles the divine, and the body the mortal.\"\n\n470. ~gloomy shadows damp~: see note, l. 207.\n\n471. ~charnel-vaults~, burial vaults. 'Charnel' (O.F. _charnel_, Lat.\n_carnalis_; _caro_, flesh): comp. 'carnal,' l. 474.\n\n473. ~As loth~, etc. The construction is: 'As (being) loth to leave the\nbody that it loved, and (as having) linked itself to a degenerate and\ndegraded state.' ~it~: by syntax this pronoun refers to 'shadows,' or (in\nthought) '_such_ shadow.' It seems best, however, to connect it with\n'soul,' line 467.\n\n474. ~sensualty~. The modern form of the word is _sensuality_.\n\n475. ~degenerate and degraded~: the former because 'imbodied,' the latter\nbecause 'imbruted.'\n\n476. ~divine Philosophy~, _i.e._ such philosophy as is to be found in \"the\ndivine volume of Plato\" (as Milton has called it).\n\n477. ~crabbed~, sour or bitter: comp. crab-apple. _Crab_ (a shell-fish)\nand _crab_ (a kind of apple) are radically connected, both conveying the\nidea of scratching or pinching (Skeat).\n\n478. ~Apollo's lute~: Apollo being the god of song and music. Comp. _Par.\nReg._ i. 478-480; _L. L. L._ iv. 3. 342, \"as sweet and musical As bright\n_Apollo's lute_, strung with his hair.\"\n\n479. ~nectared sweets~. Nectar (Gk. \u00ce\u00bd\u00e1\u00bd\u00b3\u00ce\u00ba\u00cf\u0084\u00ce\u00b1\u00cf\u0081, the drink of the\ngods) is repeatedly used by Milton to express the greatest sweetness:\nsee l. 838; _Par. Lost_, iv. 333, \"Nectarine fruits\"; v. 306, 426.\n\n482. ~Methought~: see note, l. 171. ~what should it be?~ This is a direct\nquestion about a past event, and means 'What was it likely to be?' \"It\nseems to increase the emphasis of the interrogation, since a doubt about\nthe past (time having been given for investigation) implies more\nperplexity than a doubt about the future\" (Abbott, \u00c2\u00a7 325). ~For certain~,\n_i.e._ for certain truth, certainly.\n\n483. ~night-foundered~; benighted, lost in the darkness. Radically, 'to\nfounder' is to go to the bottom (Fr. _fondrer_; Lat. _fundus_, the\nbottom), hence applied to ships; it is also applied to horses sinking in\na slough. The compound is Miltonic (see _Par. Lost_, i. 204), and is\nsometimes stigmatised as meaningless; on the contrary, it is very\nexpressive, implying that the brothers are swallowed up in night and\nhave lost their way. 'Founder' is here used in the secondary sense of\n'to be lost' or 'to be in distress.'\n\n484. ~neighbour~. An adjective, as in line 576, and frequently in\nShakespeare. Neighbour = nigh-boor, _i.e._ a peasant dwelling near.\n\n487. ~Best draw~: we had best draw our swords.\n\n489. ~Defence is a good cause~, etc., _i.e._ 'in defending ourselves we\nare engaged in a good cause, and may Heaven be on our side.'\n\n490. ~That hallo~. We are to understand that the Attendant Spirit has\nhalloed just before entering; this is shown by the stage-direction given\nin the edition of _Comus_ printed by Lawes in 1637: _He hallos; the\nGuardian D\u00c3\u00a6mon hallos again, and enters in the habit of a shepherd._\n\n491. ~you fall~, etc., _i.e._ otherwise you will fall on our swords.\n\n493. ~sure~: see note, l. 246.\n\n494. ~Thyrsis~, Like Lycidas, this name is common in pastoral poetry. In\nMilton's _Epitaphium Damonis_ it stands for Milton himself; in _Comus_\nit belongs to Lawes, who now receives additional praise for his musical\ngenius. In lines 86-88 the compliment is enforced by alliterative\nverses, and here by the aid of rhyme (495-512). Masson thinks that the\npoet, having spoken of the madrigals of Thyrsis, may have introduced\nthis rhymed passage in order to prolong the feeling of Pastoralism by\ncalling up the cadence of known English pastoral poems.\n\n495. ~sweetened ... dale~; poetical exaggeration or hyperbole, implying\nthat fragrant flowers became even more fragrant from Thyrsis' music.\n\n496. ~huddling~. This conveys the two ideas of hastening and crowding:\ncomp. Horace, _Ars Poetica_, 19, \"Et _properantis_ aquae per amoenos\nambitus agros.\" ~madrigal~: a pastoral or shepherd's song (Ital. _mandra_,\na flock): such compositions, then in favour, had been made by Lawes and\nby Milton's father.\n\n497. ~swain~: a word of common use in pastoral poetry. It denotes strictly\na peasant or, more correctly, a young man: comp. the compounds\nboat-_swain_, cox-_swain_. See _Arc._ 26, \"Stay, gentle _swains_,\" etc.\n\n499. ~pent~, penned, participle of _pen_, to shut up (A.S. _pennan_, which\nis connected with _pin_, seen in _pin_-fold, l. 7). ~forsook~: a form of\nthe past tense used for the participle.\n\n501. ~and his next joy~, _i.e._ 'and (thou), his next joy'--words\naddressed to the second brother.\n\n502. ~trivial toy~, ordinary trifle. The phrase seems redundant, but\n'trivial' may here be used in the strict sense of common or well-known.\nCompare _Il Pens._ 4, \"fill the fixed mind with all your _toys_\"; and\nBurton's _Anat. of Mel._, \"complain of _toys_, and fear without a\ncause.\"\n\n503. ~stealth of~, things stolen by.\n\n506. ~To this my errand~, etc., _i.e._ in comparison with this errand of\nmine and the anxiety it involved. 'To' = in comparison with; an idiom\ncommon in Elizabethan English, _e.g._ \"There is no woe _to_ this\ncorrection,\" _Two Gent._ ii. 4. 138. See Abbott, \u00c2\u00a7 187.\n\n508. ~How chance~. _Chance_ is here a verb followed by a substantive\nclause: 'how does it chance that,' etc. This idiom is common in\nShakespeare (Abbott, \u00c2\u00a7 37), where it sometimes has the force of an\nadverb (= perchance): compare _Par. Lost_, ii. 492: \"If chance the\nradiant sun, with farewell sweet,\" etc.\n\n509. ~sadly~, seriously. Radically, sad = sated or full (A.S. _saed_);\nhence the two meanings, 'serious' and 'sorrowful,' the former being\ncommon in Spenser, Bacon, and Shakespeare. Comp. 'some _sad_ person of\nknown judgment' (Bacon); _Romeo and Jul._ i. 1. 205, \"Tell me in\n_sadness_, who is that you love\"; _Par. Lost_, vi. 541, \"settled in his\nface I see _Sad_ resolution.\" See also Swinburne's _Miscellanies_\n(1886), page 170.\n\n510. ~our neglect~, _i.e._ neglect on our part.\n\n511. ~Ay me~! Comp. _Lyc._ 56, \"Ay me! I fondly dream\"; 154. This\nexclamatory phrase = ah me! Its form is due to the French _aymi_ = alas,\nfor me! and has no connection with _ay_ or _aye_ = yes. In this line\n_true_ rhymes with _shew_: comp. _youth_ and _shew'th_, _Sonnet on his\nhaving arrived at the age of twenty-three_.\n\n512. ~Prithee~. A familiar fusion of _I pray thee_, sometimes written\n'pr'ythee.' Lines 495-512 form nine rhymed couplets.\n\n513. ~ye~: a dative. See note on l. 216.\n\n514. ~shallow~. Comp. _Son._ i. 6, \"_shallow_ cuckoo's bill,\" xii_a_. 12;\n_Arc._ 41, \"_shallow_-searching Fame.\"\n\n515. ~sage poets~. Homer and Virgil are meant; both of these mention the\nchimera. Milton (_Par. Lost_, iii. 19) afterwards speaks of himself as\n\"taught by the heavenly Muse.\" Comp. _L'Alleg._ 17; _Il Pens._ 117,\n\"great bards besides In sage and solemn tunes have sung.\"\n\n516. ~storied~, related: 'To story' is here used actively: the past\nparticiple is frequent in the sense of 'bearing a story or picture'; _Il\nPens._ 159, \"storied windows\"; Gray's _Elegy_, 41, \"storied urn\";\nTennyson's \"storied walls.\" _Story_ is an abbreviation of _history_.\n\n517. ~Chimeras~, monsters. Comp. the sublime passage in _Par. Lost_, ii.\n618-628. The Chimera was a fire-breathing monster, with the head of a\nlion, the tail of a dragon, and the body of a goat. It was slain by\nBellerophon. As a common name 'chimera' is used by Milton to denote a\nterrible monster, and is now current (in an age which rejects such\nfabulous creatures) in the sense of a wild fancy; hence the adj.\n_chimerical_ = wild or fanciful. ~enchanted isles~, _e.g._ those of Circe\nand Calypso, mentioned in the _Odyssey_.\n\n518. ~rifted rocks~: rifted = riven. Orpheus, in search of Eurydice,\nentered the lower world through the rocky jaws of Taenarus, a cape in\nthe south of Greece (see Virgil _Georg._ iv. 467, _Taenarias fauces_);\nhere also Hercules emerged from Hell with the captive Cerberus.\n\n519. ~such there be~. See note on l. 12 for this indicative use of _be_.\n\n520. ~navel~, centre, inmost recess. Shakespeare (_Cor._ iii. l. 123)\nspeaks of the 'navel of the state'; and in Greek Calypso's island was\n'the navel of the sea,' while Apollo's temple at Delphi was 'the navel\nof the earth.'\n\n521. ~Immured~, enclosed. Here used generally: radically it = shut up\nwithin walls (Lat. _murus_, a wall).\n\n523. ~witcheries~, enchantments.\n\n526. ~murmurs~. The incantations or spells of evil powers were sung or\nmurmured over the doomed object; sometimes they were muttered (as here)\nover the enchanted food or drink prepared for the victim. Comp. l. 817\nand _Arc._ 60, \"With puissant words and _murmurs_ made to bless.\"\n\n529. ~unmoulding reason's mintage charactered~, _i.e._ defacing those\nsigns of a rational soul that are stamped on the human face. The figure\nis taken from the process of melting down coins in order to restamp\nthem. 'Charactered': here used in its primary sense (Gk. \u00cf\u0087\u00ce\u00b1\u00cf\u0081\u00ce\u00b1\u00ce\u00ba\u00cf\u0084\u00e1\u00bd\u00b5\u00cf\u0081, an\nengraven or stamped mark), as in the phrase 'printed characters.' The\nword is here accented on the second syllable; in modern English on the\nfirst.\n\n531. ~crofts that brow~ = crofts that overhang. Croft = a small field,\ngenerally adjoining a house. Brow = overhang: comp. _L'Alleg._ 8,\n\"low-browed rocks.\"\n\n532. ~bottom glade~: the glade below. The word _bottom_, however, is\nfrequent in Shakespeare in the sense of 'valley'; hence 'bottom glade'\nmight be interpreted 'glade in the valley.'\n\n533. ~monstrous rout~; see note on the stage-direction after l. 92. Comp.\n'the bottom of the monstrous world,' _Lyc._ 158. In _Aen._ vii. 15, we\nread that when Aeneas sailed past Circe's island he heard \"the growling\nnoise of lions in wrath, ... and shapes of huge wolves fiercely howling.\"\n\n534. ~stabled wolves~, wolves in their dens. _Stable_ (= a standing-place)\nis used by Milton in the general sense of abode, _e.g._ in _Par. Lost_,\nxi. 752, \"sea-monsters whelped and _stabled_.\" Comp. \"Stable for\ncamels,\" _Ezek._ xxv. 5, and the Latin _stabulum_, _Aen._ vi. 179,\n_stabula alta ferarum_.\n\n535. ~Hecate~: see l. 135.\n\n536. ~bowers~: see note, l. 45.\n\n539. ~unweeting~; unwitting, unknowing. This spelling is found in\nSpenser's _Faerie Queene_, both in the compounds and in the simple verb\n_weet_, a corruption of _wit_ (A.S. _witan_, to know). Compare _Par.\nReg._ i. 126, \"_unweeting_, he fulfilled The purposed counsel.\" _Sams.\nAgon._ 1680; Chaucer, _Doctor's Tale_, \"Virginius came _to weet_ the\njudge's will.\"\n\n540. ~by then~, _i.e._ by the time when. The demonstrative adverb thus\nimplies a relative adverb: comp. the Greek, where the demonstrative is\ngenerally omitted, though in Homer occasionally the demonstrative alone\nis used. Another rendering is to make line 540 parenthetical.\n\n542. ~knot-grass~. A grass with knotted or jointed stem: some, however,\nsuppose marjoram to be intended here. ~dew-besprent~, _i.e._ besprinkled\nwith dew: comp. _Lyc._ 29. _Be_ is an intensive prefix; _sprent_ is\nconnected with M.E. _sprengen_, to scatter, of which _sprinkle_ is the\nfrequentative form.\n\n543. ~sat me down~: see note, l. 61.\n\n544. ~canopied, and interwove~. Comp. _M. N. D._ ii. 2. 49, 'I know a\nbank,' etc. In sense 'canopied' refers to 'bank,' and 'interwove' to\n'ivy.' There are two forms of the past participle of _weave_, viz.\n_wove_ and _woven_: see _Arc._ 47.\n\n545. ~flaunting~, showy, garish. In _Lyc._ 146, the poet first wrote\n'garish columbine,' then 'well-attired woodbine.'\n\n547. ~meditate ... minstrelsy~, _i.e._ to sing a pastoral song: comp.\n_Lyc._ 32. 66. _To meditate the muse_ is a Virgilian phrase: see _Ecl._\ni. and vi. The Lat. _meditor_ has the meaning of 'to apply one's self\nto,' and does not mean merely to ponder.\n\n548. ~had~, should have: comp. l. 394. ~ere a close~, _i.e._ before he had\nfinished his song (Masson). _Close_ occurs in the technical sense of\n'the final cadence of a piece of music.'\n\n549. ~wonted~: see note, l. 332.\n\n550. ~barbarous~: comp. _Son._ xii. 3, \"a _barbarous_ noise environs me Of\nowls and cuckoos, etc.\"\n\n551. ~listened them~. The omission of _to_ after verbs of hearing is\nfrequent in Shakespeare and others: comp. \"To listen our purpose\"; \"List\na brief tale\"; \"hearken the end\"; etc. (see Abbott, \u00c2\u00a7 199). 'Them': this\nrefers to the _sounds_ implied in 'dissonance.'\n\n552. ~unusual stop~. This refers to what happened at l. 145, and the \"soft\nand solemn-breathing sound\" to l. 230.\n\n553. ~drowsy frighted~, _i.e._ drowsy and frighted. The noise of Comus's\nrout is here supposed to have kept the horses of night awake and in a\nstate of drowsy agitation until the sudden calm put an end to their\nuneasiness. In Milton's corrected MS. we read 'drowsy flighted,' where\nthe two words are not co-ordinate epithets but must be regarded as\nexpressing one idea = flying drowsily; to express this some insert a\nhyphen. Comp. 'dewy-feathered,' _Il Pens._ 146, and others of Milton's\nremarkable compound adjectives. The reading in the text is that of the\nprinted editions of 1637, '45, and '73.\n\n554. ~Sleep~ (or Night) is represented as drawn by horses in a chariot\nwith its curtains closely drawn. Comp. _Macbeth_, ii. l. 51, \"curtained\nsleep.\"\n\n555. 'The lady's song rose into the air so sweetly and imperceptibly\nthat silence was taken unawares and so charmed that she would gladly\nhave renounced her nature and existence for ever if her place could\nalways be filled by such music.' Comp. _Par. Lost_, iv. 604, \"She all\nnight long her amorous descant sung; _Silence was pleased_\"; also\nJonson's _Vision of Delight_:\n\n    \"Yet let it like an odour rise\n    To all the senses here,\n    And fall like sleep upon their eyes,\n    Or music in their ear.\"\n\n558. ~took~, taken. Comp. l. 256 for a similar use of _take_, and compare\n'forsook,' line 499, for the form of the word.\n\n560. ~Still~, always. This use of _still_ is frequent in Elizabethan\nwriters (Abbott, \u00c2\u00a7 69). ~I was all ear~. Warton notes this expressive\nidiom (still current) in Drummond's 'Sonnet to the Nightingale,' and in\n_Tempest_, iv. l. 59, \"all eyes.\" _All_ is an attribute of _I_.\n\n561. ~create a soul~, etc., _i.e._ breathe life even into the dead: comp.\n_L'Alleg._ 144. Warton supposes that Milton may have seen a picture in\nan old edition of Quarles' _Emblems_, in which \"a soul in the figure of\nan infant is represented within the ribs of a skeleton, as in its\nprison.\" _Rom._ vii. 24, \"Who shall deliver me out of the body of this\ndeath?\"\n\n565. ~harrowed~, distracted, torn as by a _harrow_. This is probably the\nmeaning, but there is a verb 'harrow' corrupted from 'harry,' to subdue;\nhence some read \"harried with grief and fear.\"\n\n567. ~How sweet ... how near~. This sentence contains two exclamations:\nthis is a Greek construction. In English the idiom is \"How sweet ...\n_and_ how near,\" etc. We may, however, render the line thus: \"How\nsweet..., how near the deadly snare _is_!\"\n\n568. ~lawns~. 'Lawn' is always used by Milton to denote an open stretch of\ngrassy ground, whereas in modern usage it is applied generally to a\nsmooth piece of grass-grown land in front of a house. The origin of the\nword is disputed, but it seems radically to denote 'a clear space'; it\nis said to be cognate with _llan_ used as a prefix in the names of\ncertain Welsh towns, _e.g._ Llandaff, Llangollen. In Chaucer it takes\nthe form launde.\n\n569. ~often trod by day~, which I have often trod by day, and therefore\nknow well.\n\n570. ~mine ear~: see note, l. 171.\n\n571. ~wizard~. Here used in contempt, like many other words with the\nsuffix _-ard_, or _-art_, as braggart, sluggard, etc. Milton\noccasionally, however, uses the word merely in the sense of magician or\nmagical, without implying contempt: see _Lyc._ 55, \"Deva spreads her\n_wizard_ stream.\"\n\n572. ~certain signs~: see l. 644.\n\n574. ~aidless~: an obsolete word. See Trench's _English Past and Present_\nfor a list of about 150 words in _-less_, all now obsolete: comp. l. 92,\nnote. ~wished~: wished for. Comp. l. 950 for a similar transitive use of\nthe verb.\n\n575. ~such two~: two persons of such and such description.\n\n577. ~durst not stay~. _Durst_ is the old past tense of _dare_, and is\nused as an auxiliary: the form _dared_ is much more modern, and may be\nused as an independent verb.\n\n578. ~sprung~: see note, l. 256.\n\n579. ~till I had found~. The language is extremely condensed here, the\nmeaning being, 'I began my flight, and continued to run till I _had\nfound_ you'; the pluperfect tense is used because the speaker is looking\nback upon his meeting with the brothers after completing a long\nnarration of the circumstances that led up to it. If, however, 'had\nfound' be regarded as a subjunctive, the meaning is, 'I began my flight,\nand determined to continue it until I had found (_i.e._ should have\nfound) you.' Comp. Abbott \u00c2\u00a7 361.\n\n581. ~triple knot~, a three-fold alliance of Night, Shades, and Hell.\n\n584. \"This confidence of the elder brother in favour of the final\nefficacy of virtue, holds forth a very high strain of philosophy,\ndelivered in as high strains of eloquence and poetry\" (Warton). And Todd\nadds: \"Religion here gave energy to the poet's strains.\"\n\n585. ~safely~, confidently. ~period~, sentence.\n\n586. ~for me~, _i.e._ for my part, so far as I am concerned: see note, l.\n602.\n\n588. ~Which erring men call Chance~. 'Erring' belongs to the predicate;\n\"which men erroneously call Chance.\" Comp. Pope, _Essay on Man_:\n\n    \"All nature is but art, unknown to thee;\n    All chance, direction, which thou canst not see.\"\n\n588. ~this I hold firm~. 'This' is explained by the next line: \"this\nbelief, namely, that Virtue may be assailed, etc., I hold firmly.\"\n\n590. ~enthralled~, enslaved. Comp. l. 1022.\n\n591. ~which ... harm~, which the Evil Power intended to be most harmful.\n\n595-7. ~Gathered like scum~, etc. According to one editor, this image is\n\"taken from the conjectures of astronomers concerning the dark spots\nwhich from time to time appear on the surface of the sun's body and\nafter a while disappear again; which they suppose to be the scum of that\nfiery matter which first breeds it, and then breaks through and consumes\nit.\"\n\n598. ~pillared firmament~. The firmament (Lat. _firmus_, firm or solid) is\nhere regarded as the roof of the earth and supported on pillars. The\nancients believed the stars to be fixed in the solid firmament: comp.\n_Par. Reg._ iv. 55; also _Wint. Tale_, ii. l. 100, \"If I mistake In\nthose foundations which I build upon, The centre is not big enough to\nbear A schoolboy's top.\"\n\n602. ~for~, as regards. ~let ... girt~, though he be surrounded.\n\n603. ~grisly legions~. 'Grisly,' radically the same as _grue-some_ =\nhorrible, causing terror. In _Par. Lost_, iv. 821, Satan is called \"the\ngrisly king.\" 'Legions' is here a trisyllable.\n\n604. ~sooty flag of Acheron~. Acheron, at first the name of a river of the\nlower world, came to be used as a name for the whole of the lower world\ngenerally. Todd quotes from P. Fletcher's _Locusts_ (1627): \"All hell\nrun out and sooty flags display.\"\n\n605. ~Harpies and Hydras~. The Harpies (lit. 'spoilers') were unclean\nmonsters, being birds with the heads of maidens, with long claws and\ngaunt faces. _Hydras_, here used as a general name for monstrous\nwater-serpents (Gk. _hyd\u00c5\u008dr_, water); the name was first given to the\nnine-headed monster slain by Hercules. See _Son._ xv. 7, \"new rebellions\nraise Their _Hydra_ heads\"; the epithet 'hydra-headed' being applied to\na rebellion, an epidemic, or other evil that seems to gain strength from\nevery endeavour to repress it.\n\n607. ~return his purchase back~, _i.e._ 'give up his spoil,' or (as in the\nMS.) 'release his new-got prey.' To purchase (Fr. _pour-chasser_)\noriginally meant to pursue eagerly, hence to acquire by fair means or\nfoul: it thus came to mean 'to steal' (as frequently in Spenser, Jonson,\nand Shakespeare), and 'to buy' (its current sense). See Trench, _Study\nof Words_; _Hen. V._ iii. 2. 45, \"They will steal anything, and call it\n_purchase_\"; i. _Hen. IV._ ii. l. 101, \"thou shalt have share in our\n_purchase_.\"\n\n609. ~venturous~, ready to venture. See note, l. 79.\n\n610. ~yet~, nevertheless. The meaning is: '_Though_ thy courage is\nuseless, _yet_ I love it.' ~emprise~: an obsolete form (common in Spenser)\nof _enterprise_. It is literally that which is undertaken; hence\n'readiness to undertake'; hence 'daring.'\n\n611. ~can do thee little stead~, _i.e._ can help thee little. _Stead_,\nboth as noun and verb, is obsolete except in certain phrases, _e.g._ 'to\nstand in good stead,' and in composition, _e.g._ _stead_fast,\nhome_stead_, in_stead_, Hamp_stead_, etc. Its strict sense is place or\nposition: comp. _Il Pens._ 3, \"How little you _bested_.\"\n\n612. ~Far other arms~, _i.e._ very different arms. 'Other' has here its\nradical sense of 'different,' and can therefore be modified by an\nadverb.\n\n615. ~unthread~, loosen. Comp. _Temp._ iv. l. 259, \"Go charge my goblins\nthat they grind their joints With dry convulsions, shorten up their\nsinews With aged cramps.\"\n\n617. ~As to make this relation~, _i.e._ as to be able to tell this.\n\n619. ~a certain shepherd lad~. This is supposed to refer to Charles\nDiodati, Milton's dearest friend, to whom he addressed his 1st and 6th\nelegies, and after whose death he wrote the touching poem _Epitaphium\nDamonis_, in which he alludes to his friend's medical and botanical\nskill:\n\n    \"There thou shalt cull me simples, and shalt teach\n    Thy friend the name and healing powers of each.\"\n\n    (_Cowper's translation._)\n\n620. ~Of small regard to see to~: in colloquial English, 'not much to look\nat.' This is an old idiom: comp. Greek \u00ce\u00ba\u00ce\u00b1\u00ce\u00bb\u00e1\u00bd\u00b8\u00cf\u0082 \u00e1\u00bc\u00b0\u00ce\u00b4\u00ce\u00b5\u00e1\u00bf\u0096\u00ce\u00bd: see English\nBible, \"goodly to look to,\" i. _Sam._ xvi. 12; _Ezek._ xxiii. 15; _Jer._\nxlvii. 3.\n\n621. ~virtuous~, of healing power: see note, l. 165. Comp. _Il Pens._ 113,\n\"the virtuous ring and glass.\"\n\n623. ~beg me sing~: see note, l. 304.\n\n625. ~ecstasy~: see note, l. 261. The Greek _ekstasis_ = standing out of\none's self.\n\n626. ~scrip~, wallet.\n\n627. ~simples~, medicinal herbs. 'Simple' (Lat. _simplicem_, 'one-fold,'\n'not compound') was used of a single ingredient in a medicine; hence its\npopular use in the sense of 'herb' or 'drug.'\n\n630. ~me~, _i.e._ for me: the ethic dative.\n\n633. ~bore~. The nom. of this verb is, in sense, some such word as the\nplant or the root.\n\n634. ~unknown and like esteemed~: known and esteemed to a like extent,\n_i.e._ in both cases not at all. _Like_ here corresponds to the prefix\n_un_ in _unknown_. On the description of the plant, see Introduction,\nreference to Ascham's _Scholemaster_.\n\n635. ~clouted shoon~, patched shoes. The expression is found in\nShakespeare, ii. _Hen. VI._ iv. 2. 195, \"Spare none but such as go in\n_clouted shoon_\"; _Cym._ iv. 2. 214, \"put My _clouted brogues_ from off\nmy feet, whose rudeness Answer'd my steps too loud\": see examples in\nMayhew and Skeat's _M. E. Dictionary_. There are instances, however, of\n_clout_ in the sense of a plate of iron fastened on the sole of a shoe.\nIn either sense of the word 'clouted shoon' would be heavy and coarse.\n_Shoon_ is an old plural (O.E. _scon_); comp. _hosen_, _eyen_ (= eyes),\n_dohtren_ (= daughters), _foen_ (= foes), etc.\n\n636. ~more med'cinal~, of greater virtue. The line may be scanned thus:\nAnd yet | more med | 'cinal is | it than | that Mo | ly. ~Moly~. When\nUlysses was approaching the abode of Circe he was met by Hermes, who\nsaid: \"Come then, I will redeem thee from thy distress, and bring\ndeliverance. Lo, take this herb of virtue, and go to the dwelling of\nCirce, that it may keep from thy head the evil day. And I will tell thee\nall the magic sleight of Circe. She will mix thee a potion and cast\ndrugs into the mess; but not even so shall she be able to enchant thee;\nso helpful is this charmed herb that I shall give thee ... Therewith the\nslayer of Argos gave me the plant that he had plucked from the ground,\nand he showed me the growth thereof. It was black at the root, but the\nflower was like to milk. _Moly_ the gods call it, but it is hard for\nmortal men to dig; howbeit with the gods all things are possible\"\n(_Odyssey_, x. 280, etc., _Butcher and Lang's translation_). In his\nfirst Elegy Milton alludes to M\u00c5\u008dly as the counter-charm to the spells\nof Circe: see also Tennyson's _Lotos-Eaters_, \"beds of amaranth and\n_moly_.\"\n\n638. ~He called it H\u00c3\u00a6mony~. _He_ is the shepherd lad of line 619.\n_Haemony_: Milton invents the plant, both name and thing. But the\nadjective _Haemonian_ is used, in Latin poetry as = _Thessalian_,\nHaemonia being the old name of Thessaly. And as Thessaly was regarded as\na land of magic, 'Haemonian' acquired the sense of 'magical' (see Ovid,\n_Met._ vii 264, \"_Haemonia_ radices valle resectas,\" etc.), and Milton's\nHaemony is simply \"the magical plant.\" Coleridge supposes that by the\nprickles and gold flower of the plant Milton signified the sorrows and\ntriumph of the Christian life.\n\n639. ~sovran use~: see note, l. 41. The use of this adjective with charms,\nmedicines, or remedies of any kind was so very common that the word came\nto imply 'all-healing,' 'supremely efficacious'; see _Cor._ ii. 1. 125,\n\"The most _sovereign_ prescription in Galen.\"\n\n640. ~mildew blast~: comp. _Arc._ 48-53, _Ham._ iii. 4. 64, \"Here is your\nhusband; Like a _mildew'd_ ear _Blasting_ his wholesome brother.\" A\nmildew blast is one giving rise to that kind of blight called mildew\n(A.S. melede\u00c3\u00a1w, honey-dew), it being supposed that the prevalence of dry\neast winds was favourable to its formation.\n\n642. ~pursed it up~, etc., _i.e._ put it in my wallet, though I did not\nattach much importance to it. ~little reckoning~: comp. _Lyc._ 116, where\nthe very same phrase occurs.\n\n643. ~Till now that~. Here _that_ = when, the clause introduced by it\nbeing explanatory of _now_ (see Abbott, \u00c2\u00a7 284).\n\n646-7. ~Entered ... came off~. 'I entered into the very midst of his\ntreacherous enchantments, and yet escaped.' _Lime-twigs_ = snares; in\nallusion to the practice of catching birds by means of twigs smeared\nwith a viscous substance (called on that account 'birdlime').\nShakespeare makes repeated allusion to this practice: see _Macbeth_, iv.\n2. 34; _Two Gent._ ii. 2. 68; ii. _Hen. VI._ i. 3. 91; etc.\n\n649. ~necromancer's hall~. Warton supposes that Milton here thought of a\nmagician's castle which has an enchanted hall invaded by Christian\nknights, as we read of in the romances of chivalry. _Necromancer_, lit.\none who by magical power can commune with the dead (Gk. \u00ce\u00bd\u00ce\u00b5\u00ce\u00ba\u00cf\u0081\u00e1\u00bd\u00b9\u00cf\u0082, a\ncorpse); hence a sorcerer. From confusion of the first syllable with\nthat of the Lat. _niger_, black, the art of necromancy came to be called\n\"the black art.\"\n\n650. ~Where if he be~, Lat. _ubi si sit_: in English the relative adverb\nin such cases is best rendered by a conjunction + a demonstrative\nadverb; thus, '_and_ if he be _there_.'\n\n651. ~brandished blade~. Comp. Hermes' advice to Ulysses: \"When it shall\nbe that Circe smites thee with her long wand, even then draw thy sharp\nsword from thy thigh, and spring on her, as one eager to slay her,\"\n_Odyssey_, x. ~break his glass~. An imitation of Spenser, who makes Sir\nGuyon break the golden cup of the enchantress Excess, _F. Q._ i. 12,\nstanza 56.\n\n652. ~luscious~, delicious. The word is a corruption of _lustious_ from\nO.E. _lust_ = pleasure: see note, l. 49.\n\n653. ~But seize his wand~. The force of this injunction is shown by lines\n815-819.\n\n654. ~menace high~, violent threat. _High_ is thus used in a number of\nfigurative senses, _e.g._ a high wind, a high hand, high passions (_Par.\nLost_, ix. 123), high descent, high design, etc.\n\n655. ~Sons of Vulcan~. In the _Aeneid_ (Bk. viii. 252) we are told that\nCacus, son of Vulcan (the Roman God of Fire), \"vomited from his throat\nhuge volumes of smoke\" when pursued by Hercules, \"_Faucibus ingentem\nfumum_,\" etc.\n\n657. ~apace~; quickly, at a great pace. This word has changed its\nmeaning: in Chaucer it means 'at a foot pace,' _i.e._ slowly. The first\nsyllable is the indefinite article '_a_' = one (Skeat).\n\n658. ~bear~: the subjunctive used optatively (Abbott, \u00c2\u00a7 365). (_Stage\nDirection_) ~puts by~: puts on one side, refuses. ~goes about to rise~,\n_i.e._ endeavours to rise. This idiomatic use of _go about_ still\nlingers in the phrase 'to _go about_ one's business'; comp. 'to _set\nabout_' anything.\n\n659. ~but~, merely: comp. l. 656. After the conditional clause we have\nhere a verb in the present tense ('are chained'), a construction which\nwell expresses the certainty and immediate action of the sorcerer's\nspell (see Abbott, \u00c2\u00a7 371).\n\n660. ~your nerves ... alabaster~. Comp. _Tempest_, i. 2. 471-484. Milton\nhas the word alabaster three times, twice incorrectly spelled\n_alablaster_ (in this passage and _Par. Lost_, iv. 544) and once\ncorrectly, as now entered in the text (_Par. Reg._ iv. 548). Alabaster\nis a kind of marble: comp. _On Shak._ 14, \"make us _marble_ with too\nmuch conceiving.\"\n\n661. ~or, as Daphne was~, etc. The construction is: 'if I merely wave this\nwand, you (become) a marble statue, or (you become) root-bound, as\nDaphne was, that fled Apollo.' Milton inserts the adverbial clause in\nthe predicate, which is not unusual; he then adds an attributive clause,\nwhich is not usual in English, though common in Greek and Latin. Daphne,\nan Arcadian goddess, was pursued by Apollo, and having prayed for aid,\nshe was changed into a laurel tree (Gk. \u00ce\u00b4\u00e1\u00bd\u00b1\u00cf\u0086\u00ce\u00bd\u00ce\u00b7): comp, the story of\nSyrinx and Pan, referred to in _Arc._ 106.\n\n662. ~fled~. Comp. the transitive use of the verb in l. 829, 939, _Son._\nxviii. 14, \"_fly_ the Babylonian woe\"; _Sams. Agon._ 1541, \"_fly_ The\nsight of this so horrid spectacle.\"\n\n663. ~freedom of my mind~, etc. Comp. Cowper's noble passage, \"He is the\nfreeman whom the truth makes free,\" etc. (_Task_, v. 733).\n\n665. ~corporal rind~: the body, called in _Il Pens._ 92, \"this fleshly\nnook.\"\n\n668. ~here be all~. See note, l. 12.\n\n669. ~fancy can beget~: comp. _Il Pens._ 6.\n\n672. ~cordial julep~, heart-reviving drink. _Cordial_, lit. hearty (Lat.\n_cordi_, stem of _cor_, the heart): _julep_, Persian _gul\u00c4\u0081b_, rose-water.\n\n673. ~his~ = its: see note, l. 96.\n\n674. ~syrups~: Arab, _shar\u00c4\u0081b_, a drink, wine.\n\n675. ~that Nepenthes~, etc. The allusion is explained by the following\nlines of the _Odyssey_: \"Then Helen, daughter of Zeus, turned to new\nthoughts. Presently she cast a drug into the wine whereof they drank, a\ndrug to lull all pain and anger, and bring forgetfulness of every\nsorrow. Whoso should drink a draught thereof, when it is mingled in the\nbowl, on that day he would let no tear fall down his cheeks, not though\nhis father and his mother died ... Medicines of such virtue and so\nhelpful had the daughter of Zeus, which Polydamna, the wife of Thon, had\ngiven her, a woman of Egypt, where earth the grain-giver yields herbs in\ngreatest plenty, many that are healing in the cup, and many baneful\"\n(_Butcher and Lang's translation_, iv. 219-230). 'Nepenthes,' a Greek\nadj. = sorrow-dispelling (\u00ce\u00bd\u00ce\u00b7, privative; \u00cf\u0080\u00e1\u00bd\u00b3\u00ce\u00bd\u00ce\u00b8\u00ce\u00bf\u00cf\u0082, grief). It is here used\nby Milton as the name of an opiate and it is now occasionally used as a\ngeneral name for drugs that relieve pain.\n\n677. ~Is of such power~, etc.: see note, l. 155. The construction is,\n'That Nepenthes is not of such power to stir up joy as this (julep is,\nnor is it) so friendly to life (nor) so cool to thirst.'\n\n679. ~Why ... to yourself~. Comp. Shakespeare, _Son._ i. 8, \"Thyself thy\nfoe, to thy sweet self too cruel.\"\n\n680. 'Nature gave you your beautiful person to be held in trust on\ncertain conditions, of which the most obligatory is that the body should\nhave refreshment after toil, ease after pain. Yet this very condition\nyou disregard, and deal harshly with yourself by refusing my proferred\nglass at a time when you are in need of food and rest.' Comp.\nShakespeare, _Son._ iv. \"Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend Upon\nthyself thy beauty's legacy,\" etc.\n\n685. ~unexempt condition~, _i.e._ a condition binding on all and at all\ntimes, a law of human nature.\n\n687. ~mortal frailty~, _i.e._ weak mortals: abstract for concrete.\n\n688. ~That~. The antecedent of this relative is _you_, l. 682. See note,\nl. 2.\n\n689. ~timely~, seasonable. So 'timeless' = unseasonable (Scott's\n_Marmion_, iii. 223, \"gambol rude and _timeless_ joke\"): comp. _Son._\nii. 8, \"_timely_-happy spirits\"; and l. 970.\n\n693. ~Was this ... abode~? The verb is singular, because 'cottage' and\n'safe abode' convey one idea: see Comus's words, l. 320. Notice also\nthat the past tense is used as referring to the past act of telling.\n\n694. ~aspects~: accent on final syllable.\n\n695. ~oughly-headed~: so spelt in Milton's MS. = ugly-headed. _Ugly_ is\nradically connected with _awe_.\n\n698. ~with visored falsehood and base forgery~. A vizor (also spelt\n_visor_, _visard_, _vizard_) is a mask, \"a false face.\" The allusion is\nto Comus's disguise: see l. 166. _With_ in this line, as in lines 672\nand 700, denotes _by means of_.\n\n700. ~liquorish baits~: see note on _baited_, l. 162. 'Liquorish,' by\ncatachresis for _lickerish_ = tempting to the appetite, causing one to\n_lick_ one's lips. The student should carefully distinguish the three\nwords _lickerish_ (as above), _liquorish_ (which is really meaningless)\nand _liquorice_ (= licorice = Lat. _glycyrrhiza_), a plant with a sweet\nroot.\n\n702. ~treasonous~; an obsolete word. The current form 'treasonable' has\nusually a more restricted sense: Milton and Shakespeare use _treasonous_\nin the more general sense of _traitorous_ (a cognate word). In this line\n'offer' = the thing offered.\n\n703. ~good men ... good things~. This noble sentiment Milton has borrowed\nfrom Euripides, _Medea_, 618, \u00ce\u009a\u00ce\u00b1\u00ce\u00ba\u00ce\u00bf\u00e1\u00bf\u00a6 \u00ce\u00b3\u00e1\u00bd\u00b0\u00cf\u0081 \u00e1\u00bc\u0080\u00ce\u00bd\u00ce\u00b4\u00cf\u0081\u00e1\u00bd\u00b8\u00cf\u0082 \u00ce\u00b4\u00e1\u00bf\u00b6\u00cf\u0081\u00e1\u00be\u00bd \u00e1\u00bd\u0084\u00ce\u00bd\u00ce\u00b7\u00cf\u0083\u00ce\u00b9\u00ce\u00bd \u00ce\u00bf\u00e1\u00bd\u0090\u00ce\u00ba \u00e1\u00bc\u0094\u00cf\u0087\u00ce\u00b5\u00ce\u00b9, \"the\ngifts of the bad man are without profit.\" (Newton).\n\n704. ~that which is not good~, etc. This is Platonic: the soul has a\nrational principle and an irrational or appetitive, and when the former\ncontrols the latter, the desires are for what is good only (_Rep._ iv.\n439).\n\n707. ~budge doctors of the Stoic fur~. Budge is lambskin with the wool\ndressed outwards, worn on the edge of the hoods of bachelors of arts,\netc. Therefore, if both _budge_ and _fur_ be taken literally the line is\ntautological. But 'budge' has the secondary sense of 'solemn,' like a\ndoctor in his robes; and 'fur' may be used figuratively in the sense of\n_sect_, just as \"the cloth\" is used to denote the clergy. The whole\nphrase would thus be equivalent to 'solemn doctors of the Stoic sect.'\nIt is possible that Milton makes equivocal reference to the two senses\nof 'budge.'\n\n708. ~the Cynic tub~ = the tub of Diogenes the Cynic, here put in contempt\nfor the Cynic school of Greek philosophy, which was the forerunner of\nthe Stoic system. Diogenes, one of the early Cynics, lived in a tub, and\nwas fond of calling himself \u00e1\u00bd\u0081 \u00ce\u00ba\u00e1\u00bd\u00bb\u00cf\u0089\u00ce\u00bd (the dog).\n\n709. ~the~: here used generically.\n\n711. ~unwithdrawing~. In this participle the termination _-ing_ seems\nalmost equivalent to that of the past participle: comp. \"_all-obeying_\nbreath\" (= obeyed by all), _A. and C._ iii. 13, 77. Nature's gifts are\nnot only full but continuous.\n\n714. ~all to please ... curious taste~. _All_ = entirely, here modifies\nthe infinitives please and sate. _Curious_ = fastidious: its original\nsense is 'careful' or 'anxious.' Compare the two senses of _exquisite_,\nnote l. 359.\n\n715. ~set~, _i.e._ she set. The pronominal subject is omitted.\n\n717. ~To deck~: infinitive of purpose.\n\n718. ~in her own loins~, _i.e._ in the bowels of the earth.\n\n719. ~hutched~ = stored up, enclosed. _Hutch_ is an old word for chest or\ncoffer, chiefly used now in the compound 'rabbit-hutch.'\n\n720. ~To store her children with~, _i.e._ _wherewith_ to store her\nchildren. Or we may read, 'in order to store her children with (them).'\n'Store' = provide.\n\n721. ~pet of temperance~, _i.e._ a sudden and transitory fit of\ntemperance. ~pulse~. So Daniel and his three companions refused the\ndainties of the King of Babylon and fed on pulse and water; _Dan._ i.\n\n722. ~frieze~, coarse woollen cloth.\n\n723. ~All-giver~. Comp. Gk. \u00cf\u0080\u00ce\u00b1\u00ce\u00bd\u00ce\u00b4\u00e1\u00bd\u00bd\u00cf\u0081\u00ce\u00b1, an epithet applied to the earth as\nthe giver of all.\n\n725. 'And we should serve him as (if he were) a grudging master and a\npenurious niggard of his wealth, and (we should) live like Nature's\nbastards': see _Hebrews_ xii. 8, \"If ye are without chastening, whereof\nall have been made partakers, then are ye _bastards, and not sons_.\"\n\n728. ~Who~. The pronoun here relates not to the word immediately preceding\nit, but to the substantive implied in the possessive pronoun _her_,\n_i.e._ the sons of her who. His, her, etc., in such constructions have\ntheir full force as genitives: comp. _L'Alleg._ 124, \"her grace whom\" =\nthe grace of her whom. ~surcharged~: overloaded, 'overfraught' (l. 732).\n~waste fertility~, wasted or unused abundance. This participial use of\n'waste' seems to be due to the similarity in sound to such participles\nas 'elevate' (= elevated), 'instruct' (= instructed), etc., which occur\nin Milton (comp. _English Past and Present_, vi.).\n\n729. ~strangled~, suffocated.\n\n730. ~winged air darked with plumes~, _i.e._ the air being darkened by the\nflight of innumerable birds. Spenser also has _dark_ as a verb. Both\nclauses in this line are absolute.\n\n731. ~over-multitude~, outnumber. This line and the preceding one\nillustrate the freedom with which, in earlier English, one part of\nspeech was used for another.\n\n732. ~o'erfraught~: see note, l. 355.\n\n733. ~emblaze~, make to blaze, make splendid. There is perhaps a reference\nto the sense of _emblazon_, which is from M.E. _blazen_, to blaze\nabroad, to proclaim.\n\n734. ~bestud with stars~. In Milton's MS. it is 'bestud the centre with\ntheir star-light,' _centre_ being the 'centre of the earth.'\n\n735. ~inured~, accustomed, by custom rendered less sensitive. _Inure_ is\nfrom the old phrase 'in ure' = in operation (Fr. _\u00c5\u0093uvre_, work).\n\n737. ~coy~: shy or reserved. ~cozened~: cheated, beguiled. The origin of\nthis word is interesting: a cozener is one who, for selfish ends, claims\nkindred or _cousinship_ with another, and hence a flatterer or cheat.\n\n739-755. ~Beauty is Nature's coin~, etc. \"The idea that runs through these\nseventeen lines is a favourite one with the old poets; and Warton and\nTodd cite parallel passages from Shakespeare, Daniel, Fletcher, and\nDrayton. Thus, from Shakespeare (_M. N. D._ i. 1. 76-8):\n\n    \"Earthlier happy is the rose distilled\n    Than that which, withering on the virgin thorn,\n    Grows, lives, and dies, in single blessedness.\"\n\nSee also Shakespeare's first six sonnets, which are pervaded by the idea\nin all its subtleties\" (Masson).\n\n743. ~let slip time~, _i.e._ allow time _to_ slip: see note, l. 304. Comp.\n_Par. Lost_, i. 178. \"Let us not _slip_ the occasion.\"\n\n744. ~It~ = beauty. ~languished~, languid or languishing: comp. _Par.\nLost_, vi. 496, \"their languished hope revived\"; _Epitaph on M. of W._ 33.\nThe suffix _-ed_ is frequent in Elizabethan English where we now have\n_-ing_ (Abbott, \u00c2\u00a7 374).\n\n747. ~most~, as many as possible.\n\n748. ~homely ... home~. There is here a play upon words as in _Two Gent._\ni. 1. 2: \"_Home-keeping_ youth have ever _homely_ wits.\" _Homely_ is\nderived from _home_.\n\n749. Women with coarse complexions and dull cheeks are good enough for\nhousehold occupations.\n\n750. ~of sorry grain~, not brilliant, of poor colour. 'Grain' is from Lat.\n_granum_, a seed, applied to small objects, and hence to the coccus or\ncochineal insect which yields a variety of red dyes. Hence _grain_ came\nto denote certain colours, _e.g._ Tyrian purple, violet, etc., and is so\nused by Milton: see _Il Pens._ 33, \"a robe of darkest _grain_\"; _Par.\nLost_, v. 285, \"sky-tinctured _grain_\"; xi. 242, \"A military vest of\npurple ... Livelier than ... the _grain_ Of Sarra,\" etc. And as these\nwere fast or durable colours we have such phrases as 'to dye in grain,'\n'a rogue in grain,' 'an ingrained habit.' (See further in Marsh's _Lect.\non Eng. Lang._ p. 55).\n\n751. ~sampler~, a sample or pattern piece of needlework. It is a doublet\nof _exemplar_. ~tease the huswife's wool~. To _tease_ is to comb or card:\ncomp. the Lat. _vexare_. 'Huswife' = house-wife, further corrupted into\n_hussy_. _Hussif_ (a case for needles, etc.) is a different word.\n\n752. ~What need a vermeil-tinctured lip~? See note, l. 362, on 'what\nneed.' _Vermeil_: a French spelling of _vermilion_. The name is from\nLat. _vermis_, a worm (the cochineal insect, from which the colour used\nto be got); and as _vermis_ is cognate with Sansk. _krimi_, a worm, it\nfollows that _vermilion_, _crimson_, and _carmine_ are cognate.\n\n753. ~tresses~. Homer (_Odyssey_, v. 390) speaks of \"the fair-tressed\nDawn,\" \u00ce\u00b5\u00e1\u00bd\u0090\u00cf\u0080\u00ce\u00bb\u00e1\u00bd\u00b9\u00ce\u00ba\u00ce\u00b1\u00ce\u00bc\u00ce\u00bf\u00cf\u0082 \u00e1\u00bc\u00a8\u00e1\u00bd\u00bd\u00cf\u0082 .\n\n755. ~advised~. Contrast with 'Advice,' l. 108.\n\n756. Lines 756-761 are not addressed to Comus.\n\n757. ~but that~: were it not that.\n\n758. ~as mine eyes~: as he has already charmed mine eyes; see note, l.\n170.\n\n759. ~rules pranked in reason's garb~, _i.e._ specious arguments.\n_Pranked_ = decked in a showy manner: Milton (Prose works, i. 147, ed.\n1698) speaks of the Episcopal church service _pranking_ herself in the\nweeds of the Popish mass. Comp. _Wint. Tale_, iv. 4. 10, \"Most\ngoddess-like _prank'd_ up\"; _Par. Lost_, ii. 226, \"Belial, with words\nclothed in _reason's garb_.\"\n\n760-1. I hate when Vice brings forward refined arguments, and Virtue\nallows them to pass unchallenged. ~bolt~ = to sift or separate, as the\n_boulting-mill_ separates the meal from the bran; in this sense the word\n(also spelt _boult_) is used by Chaucer, Spenser (_F. Q._ ii. 4. 24),\nShakespeare (_Cor._ iii. 1. 322, _Wint. Tale_, iv. 4. 375, \"the fanned\nsnow that's _bolted_ By the northern blasts twice o'er,\" etc.). The\nspelling _bolt_ has confused the word with 'bolt,' to shoot or start\nout. See Index to Globe _Shakespeare_.\n\n763. ~she would her children~, etc., _i.e._ she wished (that) her children\nshould be wantonly luxurious: comp. l. 172; _Par. Lost_, i. 497-503.\n\n764. ~cateress~, stewardess, provider: lit. 'a buyer.' _Cateress_ is\nfeminine: the masculine is _caterer_, where the final _-er_ of the agent\nis unnecessarily repeated.\n\n765. ~Means ... to the good~: intends ... for the good.\n\n767. ~dictate~. The accent in Milton's time was on the first syllable,\nboth in noun and verb. ~spare Temperance~. For Milton's praises of\nTemperance comp. _Il Pens._ 46, \"Spare Fast that oft with gods doth\ndiet\"; also the 6th Elegy, 56-66; _Son._ xx., etc. \"There is much in the\nLady which resembles the youthful Milton himself--he, the Lady of his\ncollege--and we may well believe that the great debate concerning\ntemperance was not altogether dramatic (where, indeed, is Milton truly\ndramatic?), but was in part a record of passages in the poet's own\nspiritual history.\" Dowden's _Transcripts and Studies_.\n\n768. If Nature's blessings were equally distributed instead of being\nheaped upon a luxurious few, then (as Shakespeare says, _King Lear_, iv.\n1. 73) \"distribution should undo excess, And each man have enough.\"\n\n769. ~beseeming~, suitable. The original sense of _seem_ is 'to be\nfitting,' as in the words _beseem_ and _seemly_.\n\n770. ~lewdly-pampered~; one of Milton's most expressive compounds =\nwickedly gluttonous. _Lewd_ has passed through several changes of\nmeaning: (1) the lay-people as distinct from the clergy; (2) ignorant or\nunlearned; and finally (2) base or licentious.\n\n774. ~she no whit encumbered~, _i.e._ Nature would not be in the least\nsurcharged (as Comus represented in l. 728). _No whit_, used adverbially\n= not in the least, lit. 'not a particle.' Etymologically _aught_ = a\nwhit, _naught_ = no whit.\n\n776. ~His praise due paid~, _i.e._ would be duly paid. On _due_, see note,\nl. 12. ~gluttony~: abstract for concrete.\n\n779. ~Crams~, _i.e._ crams himself. There are many verbs in English that\nmay be thus used reflexively without having the pronoun expressed,\n_e.g._ _feed_, _prepare_, _change_, _pour_, _press_, etc.\n\n780. ~enow~. 'Enow' conveys the notion of a number, as in early English:\nit is also spelt _anow_, and in Chaucer _ynowe_, and is the plural of\n_enough_. It still occurs as a provincialism in England. On lines\n780-799 Masson says: \"A recurrence, by the sister, with much more mystic\nfervour, to that Platonic and Miltonic doctrine which had already been\npropounded by the Elder Brother (see lines 420-475).\"\n\n782. ~sun-clad power of chastity~. With 'sun-clad' compare 'the sacred\nrays of chastity,' l. 425. Similarly in the _Faerie Queene_, iii. 6,\nSpenser says of Belphoebe, who represents Chastity, \"And Phoebus with\nfair beams did her adorn.\"\n\n783. ~yet to what end?~ A rhetorical question, = it would be to no\npurpose.\n\n784. ~nor ... nor~. These correlatives are often used in poetry for\n_neither ... nor_ (Shakespeare often omitting the former altogether),\nand are equally correct. _Nor_ is only a contraction of _neither_, and\nthe first may as well be contracted as the second.\n\n785. ~sublime notion and high mystery~. In the _Apology for Smectymnuus_\nMilton tells of his study of the \"divine volume of Plato,\" wherein he\nlearned of the \"abstracted sublimities\" of Chastity and Love: also of\nhis study of the Holy Scripture \"unfolding these chaste and high\nmysteries, with timeless care infused, that the body is for the Lord,\nand the Lord for the body.\"\n\n790. ~dear wit~. 'Dear' is here used in contempt: its original sense is\n'precious' (A.S. _deore_), but in Elizabethan English it has a variety\nof meanings, _e.g._ intense, serious, grievous, great, etc. Comp. \"sad\noccasion _dear_,\" _Lyc._ 6; \"_dear_ groans,\" _L. L. L._ v. 2. 874. Craik\nsuggests \"that the notion properly involved in it of love, having first\nbecome generalised into that of a strong affection of any kind, had\nthence passed on to that of such an emotion the very reverse of love,\"\nas in my _dearest_ foe. ~gay rhetoric~: here so named in contempt, as\nbeing the instrument of sophistry.\n\n791. ~fence~, argumentation, _Fence_ is an abbreviation of _defence_:\ncomp. \"tongue-fence\" (Milton), \"fencer in wits' school\" (Fuller), _Much\nAdo_, v. 1. 75.\n\n794. ~rapt spirits~. 'Rapt' = enraptured, as if the mind or soul had been\n_carried out of itself_ (Lat. _raptus_, seized): comp. _Il Pens._ 40,\n\"Thy _rapt_ soul sitting in thine eyes.\" Milton also uses the word of\nthe actual snatching away of a person: \"What accident hath _rapt_ him\nfrom us,\" _Par. Lost_, ii. 40.\n\n797. ~the brute Earth~, etc., _i.e._ the senseless Earth would become\nsensible and assist me. 'Brute' = Lat. _brutus_, dull, insensible: comp.\nHorace, _Odes_, i. 34. 9, \"_bruta tellus_.\"\n\n800. ~She fables not~: she speaks truly. This line is alliterative.\n\n801. ~set off~: comp. _Lyc._ 80, \"_set off_ to the world.\"\n\n802. ~though not mortal~: _sc._ 'I am.' ~shuddering dew~. The epithet is,\nby hypallage, transferred from the person to the dew or cold sweat which\n'dips' or moistens his body.\n\n804. ~Speaks thunder and the chains of Erebus~, etc.; in allusion to the\n_Titanomachia_ or contest between Zeus and the Titans. Zeus, having been\nprovided with thunder and lightning by the Cyclops, cast the Titans into\nTartarus or Erebus, a region as far below Hell as Heaven is above the\nEarth. The leader of the Titans was Cronos (Saturn). There is a zeugma\nin _speaks_ as applied to 'thunder' and 'chains,' unless it be taken as\nin both cases equivalent to _denounces_.\n\n806. ~Come, no more!~ Comus now addresses the lady.\n\n808. ~canon laws of our foundation~, _i.e._ the established rules of our\nsociety. \"A humorous application of the language of universities and\nother foundations\" (Keightley).\n\n809. ~'tis but the lees~, etc. _Lees_ and _settlings_ are synonymous =\ndregs. The allusion is to the old physiological system of the four\nprimary humours of the body, viz. blood, phlegm, choler, and melancholy\n(see Burton's _Anat. of Mel._ i. 1, \u00c2\u00a7 ii. 2): \"Melancholy, cold and dry,\nthick, black, and sour, begotten of the more feculent part of\nnourishment, and purged from the spleen\"; Gk. \u00ce\u00bc\u00ce\u00b5\u00ce\u00bb\u00ce\u00b1\u00ce\u00b3\u00cf\u0087\u00ce\u00bf\u00ce\u00bb\u00e1\u00bd\u00b7\u00ce\u00b1 , black bile.\nSee _Sams. Agon._ 600, \"_humours black_ That mingle with thy fancy\";\nand Nash's _Terrors of the Night_ (1594): \"(Melancholy) sinketh down to\nthe bottom like the lees of the wine, corrupteth the blood, and is the\ncause of lunacy.\"\n\n811. ~straight~, immediately. The adverb _straight_ is now chiefly used of\ndirection; to indicate time _straightway_ (= in a straight way) is more\nusual: comp. _L'Alleg._ 69: \"Straight mine eye hath caught new\npleasures.\"\n\n814. ~scape~, a mutilated form of 'escape,' occurs both as a noun and a\nverb in Shakespeare and Milton: see _Par. Lost_, x. 5, \"what can _scape_\nthe eye of God?\"; _Par. Reg._ ii. 189, \"then lay'st thy _scapes_ on\nnames adored.\"\n\n816. ~without his rod reversed~. This use of the participle is a Latinism:\nsee note, l. 48. At the same time it is to be noted that a phrase of\nthis kind introduced by 'without' is in Latin frequently rendered by the\nablative absolute: such construction is here inadmissible because\n'without' also governs 'mutters.'\n\n817. ~backward mutters~. The notion of a counter-charm produced by\nreversing the magical wand and by repeating the charm backwards occurs\nin Ovid (_Met._ xiv. 300), who describes Circe as thus restoring the\nfollowers of Ulysses to their human forms. Milton skilfully makes the\nneglect of the counter-charm the occasion for introducing the legend of\nSabrina, which was likely to interest an audience assembled in the\nneighbourhood of the River Severn. On 'mutters,' see note, l. 526.\n\n820. ~bethink me~. The pronoun after this verb is reflexive. \"The\ndeliverance of their sister would be impossible but for supernatural\ninterposition, the aid afforded by the Attendant Spirit from Jove's\ncourt. In other words, Divine Providence is asserted. Not without higher\nthan human aid is the Lady rescued, and through the weakness of the\nmortal instruments of divine grace but half the intended work is\naccomplished.\" Dowden's _Transcripts and Studies_.\n\n821. In this line and the next the attributive clauses are separated\nfrom the antecedent: see note, l. 2.\n\n822. ~Melib\u00c5\u0093us~. The name of a shepherd in Virgil's _Eclogue_ i.\nPossibly the poet Spenser is here meant, as the tale of Sabrina is given\nin the _Faerie Queene_, ii. 10, 14. The tale is also told by Geoffrey of\nMonmouth and by Sackville, Drayton and Warner. As Milton refers to a\n'shepherd,' _i.e._ a poet, and to 'the soothest shepherd,' _i.e._ the\ntruest poet, and as he follows Spenser's version of the story in this\npoem, we need not hesitate to identify Meliboeus with Spenser.\n\n823. ~soothest~, truest. The A.S. _s\u00c3\u00b3th_ meant _true_; hence also 'a true\nthing' = truth. It survives in _soothe_ (lit. to affirm to be true),\n_soothsay_ (see l. 874), and _forsooth_ (= for a truth).\n\n824. ~from hence~. _Hence_ represents an A.S. word _heonan_, _-an_ being\na suffix = from: so that in the phrase 'from hence' the force of the\npreposition is twice introduced. Yet the idiom is common: it arises from\nforgetfulness of the origin of the word. Comp. _Arc._ 3: \"which _we from\nhence_ descry.\"\n\n825. ~with moist curb sways~: comp. l. 18. Sabrina was a _numen fluminis_\nor river-deity.\n\n826. ~Sabrina~: The following is Milton's version of the legend:--\"After\nthis, Brutus, in a chosen place, builds Troja Nova, changed in time to\nTrinovantum, now London; and began to enact laws (Heli being then High\nPriest in Judea); and, having governed the whole isle twenty-four years,\ndied, and was buried in his new Troy. His three sons--Locrine, Albanact,\nand Camber--divide the land by consent. Locrine had the middle part,\nLo\u00c3\u00abgria; Camber possessed Cambria or Wales; Albanact, Albania, now\nScotland. But he, in the end, by Humber, King of the Huns, who, with a\nfleet, invaded that land, was slain in fight, and his people driven back\ninto Lo\u00c3\u00abgria. Locrine and his brother go out against Humber; who now\nmarching onward was by them defeated, and in a river drowned, which to\nthis day retains his name. Among the spoils of his camp and navy were\nfound certain young maids, and Estrilidis, above the rest, passing fair,\nthe daughter of a king in Germany, from whence Humber, as he went wasting\nthe sea-coast, had led her captive; whom Locrine, though before\ncontracted to the daughter of Corineus, resolves to marry. But being\nforced and threatened by Corineus, whose authority and power he feared,\nGwendolen the daughter he yields to marry, but in secret loves the other;\nand, ofttimes retiring as to some sacrifice, through vaults and passages\nmade underground, and seven years thus enjoying her, had by her a\ndaughter equally fair, whose name was Sabra. But when once his fear was\noff by the death of Corineus, not content with secret enjoyment,\ndivorcing Gwendolen, he makes Estrilidis his Queen. Gwendolen, all in\nrage, departs into Cornwall; where Pladan, the son she had by Locrine,\nwas hitherto brought up by Corineus, his grandfather; and gathering an\narmy of her father's friends and subjects, gives battle to her husband by\nthe river Sture, wherein Locrine, shot with an arrow, ends his life. But\nnot so ends the fury of Gwendolen, for Estrilidis and her daughter Sabra\nshe throws into a river, and, to have a monument of revenge, proclaims\nthat the stream be thenceforth called after the damsel's name, which by\nlength of time is changed now to _Sabrina_ or Severn.\"--_History of\nBritain_ (1670).\n\n827. ~Whilom~, of old. An obsolete word, lit. 'at time'; A.S. _hw\u00c3\u00adlum_,\ninstr. or dat. plur. of _hwil_, time.\n\n830. ~step-dame~. For the actual relationship, see note, l. 826. The\nprefix _step_ (A.S. _ste\u00c3\u00b3p-_) means 'orphaned,' and applies properly to\na child whose parent has re-married: it was afterwards used in the words\n'step-father,' etc. _Dame_ (Fr. _dame_, a lady) retains the sense of\nmother in the form _dam_.\n\n832. ~his~ = its: see note, l. 96.\n\n834. ~pearled wrists~, wrists adorned with pearls. An appropriate epithet,\nas pearls were said to exist in the waters of the Severn.\n\n835. ~aged Nereus' hall~, the abode of old Nereus, _i.e._ the bottom of\nthe sea. Nereus, the father of the Nereids, or sea nymphs, is described\nas the wise and unerring old man of the sea; in Virgil, _grandaevus\nNereus_. See also, l. 871, and compare Jonson's _Neptune's Triumph_,\nlast song: \"Old Nereus, with his fifty girls, From aged Indus laden home\nwith pearls.\"\n\n836. ~piteous of~, _i.e._ full of pity for; comp. Lat. _miseret te\naliorum_ (genitive). Milton occasionally uses the word in this passive\nsense; its active sense is 'causing pity,' _i.e._ pitiful. Comp. Abbott,\n\u00c2\u00a7 3. ~reared her lank head~, _i.e._ raised up her drooping head: comp.\n_Par. Lost_, viii.: \"In adoration at his feet I fell Submiss: he\n_reared_ me.\" 'Lank,' lit. slender; hence weak. The adjective _lanky_ is\nin common use = tall and thin.\n\n837. ~imbathe~, to bathe in: the force of the preposition being\nreduplicated, as in Lat. _incidere in_.\n\n838. ~nectared lavers~, etc., baths sweetened with nectar and scented with\nasphodel flowers. On 'nectar,' see note, l. 479. ~asphodel~; the same,\nboth name and thing, as 'daffodil' (see _Lyc._ 150, where it takes the\nform 'daffadillies'): Gk. \u00e1\u00bc\u0080\u00cf\u0083\u00cf\u0086\u00e1\u00bd\u00b9\u00ce\u00b4\u00ce\u00b5\u00ce\u00bb\u00ce\u00bf\u00cf\u0082, M.E. _affodille_. The initial _d_ in\ndaffodil has not been satisfactorily explained: see l. 851.\n\n839. ~the porch~. So Quintilian calls the ear the vestibule of the mind:\ncomp. _Haml._ i. 5. 63: \"the porches of mine ear\"; also the phrase, \"the\nfive gateways of knowledge.\"\n\n840. ~ambrosial oils~, oils of heavenly fragrance: see note, l. 16, and\ncompare Virgil's use of _ambrosia_ in _Georg._ iv. 415, _liquidum\nambrosiae diffundit odorem_.\n\n841. ~quick immortal change~: comp. l. 10.\n\n842. ~Made Goddess~, etc. This participial construction is frequent in\nMilton as in Latin: it is equivalent to an explanatory clause.\n\n844. ~twilight meadows~: comp. \"twilight groves,\" _Il Pens._ 133;\n\"twilight ranks,\" _Arc._ 99; _Hymn Nat._ 188.\n\n845. ~Helping all urchin blasts~, remedying or preventing the blighting\ninfluence of evil spirits. 'Urchin blasts' is probably here used\ngenerally for what in _Arcades_, 49-53, are called \"noisome winds and\nblasting vapours chill,\" 'urchin' being common in the sense of 'goblin'\n(_M. W. of W._ iv. 4. 49). Strictly the word denotes the hedgehog, which\nfor various reasons was popularly regarded with great dread, and hence\nmischievous spirits were supposed to assume its form: comp. Shakespeare,\n_Temp_, i. 2. 326, ii. 2. 5, \"Fright me with _urchin_-shows\"; _Titus\nAnd._ ii. 3. 101; _Macbeth_, iv. 1. 2, \"Thrice and once the _hedge-pig_\nwhined,\" etc. Compare the protecting duties of the Genius in _Arcades_.\n~Helping~: comp. the phrases, \"I cannot _help_ it,\" _i.e._ prevent it; \"it\ncannot be _helped_,\" _i.e._ remedied, etc.\n\n846. ~shrewd~. Here used in its radical sense = _shrew-ed_, malicious,\nlike a shrew. Comp. _M. N. D._ ii. 1, \"That _shrewd_ and knavish sprite\ncalled Robin Goodfellow.\" Chaucer has the verb _shrew_ = to curse; the\ncurrent verb is _beshrew_.\n\n847. ~vialed~, contained in _phials_.\n\n850. ~garland wreaths~. A garland is a wreath, but we may take the phrase\nto mean 'wreathed garlands': comp. \"twisted braids,\" l. 862.\n\n852. ~old swain~, _i.e._ Meliboeus (l. 862). \"But neither Geoffrey of\nMonmouth nor Spenser has the development of the legend\" (Masson).\n\n853. ~clasping charm~: see l. 613, 660.\n\n854. ~warbled song~: comp. _Arc._ 87, \"touch the _warbled_ string\"; _Son._\nxx. 12, \"_Warble_ immortal notes.\"\n\n857. ~This will I try~, _i.e._ to invoke her rightly in song.\n\n858. ~adjuring~, charging by something sacred and venerable. The\nadjuration is contained in lines 867-889, which, in Milton's MS., are\ndirected \"to be said,\" not sung, and in the Bridgewater MS. \"to sing or\nnot.\" From the latter MS. it would appear that these lines were sung as\na kind of trio by Lawes and the two brothers.\n\n863. ~amber-dropping~: see note, l. 333; and comp. l. 106, where the idea\nis similar, warranting us in taking 'amber-dropping' as a compound\nepithet = dropping amber, and not (as some read) 'amber' and 'dropping.'\n_Amber_ conveys the ideas of luminous clearness and fragrance: see\n_Sams. Agon._ 720, \"_amber_ scent of odorous perfume.\"\n\n865. ~silver lake~, the Severn. Virgil has the Lat. _lacus_ in the sense\nof 'a river.'\n\n868. ~great Oceanus~, Gk. \u00e1\u00bd\u00a8\u00ce\u00ba\u00e1\u00bd\u00b3\u00ce\u00b1\u00ce\u00bd\u00e1\u00bd\u00b9\u00ce\u00bd \u00cf\u0084\u00ce\u00b5 \u00ce\u00bc\u00e1\u00bd\u00b3\u00ce\u00b3\u00ce\u00b1\u00ce\u00bd. The early Greeks regarded\nthe earth as a flat disc, surrounded by a perpetually flowing river\ncalled Oceanus: the god of this river was also called Oceanus, and\nafterwards the name was applied to the Atlantic. Hesiod, Drayton, and\nJonson have all applied the epithet 'great' to the god Oceanus; in fact,\nthroughout these lines Milton uses what may be called the \"permanent\nepithets\" of the various divinities.\n\n869. ~earth-shaking Neptune's mace~, _i.e._ the trident of Poseidon\n(Neptune). Homer calls him \u00e1\u00bc\u0090\u00ce\u00bd\u00ce\u00bd\u00ce\u00bf\u00cf\u0083\u00e1\u00bd\u00b7\u00ce\u00b3\u00ce\u00b1\u00ce\u00b9\u00ce\u00bf\u00cf\u0082 = earth-shaking: comp. _Iliad_,\nxii. 27, \"And the Shaker of the Earth with his trident in his hands,\"\netc. In _Par. Lost_, x. 294, Milton provides Death with a \"mace\npetrifick.\"\n\n870. ~Tethys' ... pace~. Tethys, wife of Oceanus, their children being the\nOceanides and river-gods. In Hesiod she is 'the venerable' (\u00cf\u0080\u00e1\u00bd\u00b9\u00cf\u0084\u00ce\u00bd\u00ce\u00b9\u00ce\u00b1 \u00ce\u00a4\u00ce\u00b7\u00ce\u00b8\u00e1\u00bd\u00bb\u00cf\u0082),\nand in Ovid 'the hoary.'\n\n871. ~hoary Nereus~: see note, l. 835.\n\n872. ~Carpathian wizard's hook~. See Virgil's _Georg._ iv. 387, \"In the\nsea-god's Carpathian gulf there lives a seer, Proteus, of the sea's own\nhue ... all things are known to him, those which are, those which have\nbeen, and those which drag their length through the advancing future.\"\n_Wizard_ = diviner, without the depreciatory sense of line 571; see note\nthere. _Hook_: Proteus had a shepherd's hook, because he tended \"the\nmonstrous herds of loathly sea-calves\": _Odyssey_, iv. 385-463.\n\n873. ~scaly Triton's ... shell~. In _Lycidas_, 89, he is \"the Herald of\nthe Sea.\" He bore a 'wreathed horn' or shell which he blew at the\ncommand of Neptune in order to still the restless waves of the sea. He\nwas 'scaly,' the lower part of his body being like that of a fish.\n\n874. ~soothsaying Glaucus~. He was a Boeotian fisherman who had been\nchanged into a marine deity, and was regarded by fishermen and sailors\nas a soothsayer or oracle: see note, l. 823.\n\n875. ~Leucothea~: lit. \"the white goddess\" (Gk. \u00ce\u00bb\u00ce\u00b5\u00cf\u0085\u00ce\u00ba\u00e1\u00bd\u00b5 , \u00ce\u00b8\u00ce\u00b5\u00e1\u00bd\u00b1), the name\nby which Ino, the daughter of Cadmus, was worshipped after she had\nthrown herself into the sea to avoid her enraged husband Athamas.\n\n876. ~her son~, _i.e._ Melisertes, drowned and deified along with his\nmother: as a sea-deity he was called Palaemon, identified by the Romans\nwith their god of harbours, Portumnus.\n\n877. ~tinsel-slippered~. The 'permanent epithet' of Thetis, a daughter of\nNereus and mother of Achilles, is \"silver-footed\" (Gk. \u00e1\u00bc\u0080\u00cf\u0081\u00ce\u00b3\u00cf\u0085\u00cf\u0081\u00e1\u00bd\u00b9\u00cf\u0080\u00ce\u00b5\u00ce\u00b6\u00ce\u00b1). Comp.\n_Neptune's Triumph_ (Jonson):\n\n    \"And all the silver-footed nymphs were drest\n    To wait upon him, to the Ocean's feast.\"\n\n'Tinsel-slippered' is a paraphrase of this, for 'tinsel' is a cloth\nworked with silver (or gold): the notion of cheap finery is not radical.\nEtymologically, _tinsel_ is that which glitters or _scintillates_. On\nthe beauty of this epithet, and of Milton's compound epithets generally,\nsee Trench, _English Past and Present_, p. 296.\n\n878-80. ~Sirens ... Parthenop\u00c3\u00a8's ... Ligea's~. The three Sirens (see\nnote, l. 253) were Parthenop\u00c3\u00a8, Lig\u00c4\u0093a, and Lucosia. The tomb of the\nfirst was at Naples (see Milton's _Ad Leonaram_, iii., \"Credula quid\nliquidam Sirena, Neapoli, jactas, Claraque Parthenopes fana\nAchel\u00c3\u00b6iados,\" etc.). Ligea, described by Virgil (_Georg._ iv. 336) as a\nsea-nymph, is here represented as seated, like a mermaid, in the act of\nsmoothing her hair with a golden comb.\n\n881. ~Wherewith~ = with which. The true adjective clause is \"sleeking ...\nlocks\" = with which she sleeks, etc.; and the true participial clause is\n\"she sits ... rocks\" = seated on ... rocks.\n\n882. ~Sleeking~, making sleek or glossy. The original sense of 'sleek' is\ngreasy: comp. _Lyc._ 99, \"On the level brine _Sleek_ Panop\u00c3\u00a8 with all her\nsisters played.\"\n\n885. ~heave~, raise. Comp. the similar use of the word in _L'Alleg._ 145,\n\"Orpheus' self may heave his head.\"\n\n887. ~bridle in~, _i.e._ restrain.\n\n888. ~have~: subjunctive after _till_, as frequently in Milton.\n\n890. ~rushy-fring\u00c3\u00a8d~, fringed with rushes. The more usual form would be\nrush-fringed: we may regard Milton's form as a participle formed from\nthe compound noun \"rushy-fringe\": comp. 'blue-haired,' l. 29;\n\"false-played,\" Shakespeare, _A. and C._ iv. 14.\n\n891. ~grows~. A singular with two nominatives connected by _and_: the verb\nis to be taken with each. But the compound subject is really equivalent\nto \"the willow with its osiers dank,\" osiers being water-willows or\ntheir branches. ~dank~, damp: comp. _Par. Lost_, vii. 441, \"oft they quit\nthe _dank_\" (= the water).\n\n893. ~Thick set~, etc., _i.e._ thickly inlaid with agate and beautified\nwith the azure sheen of turquoise, etc. There is a zeugma in _set_.\n~azurn sheen~. Sheen = brightness: it occurs again in l. 1003; see note\nthere. 'Azurn': modern English has a tendency to use the noun itself as\nan adjective in cases where older English used an adjective with the\nsuffix _-en_ = made of. Most of the adjectives in _-en_ that still\nsurvive do not now denote \"made of,\" but simply \"like,\" _e.g._ golden\nhair, etc. _Azurn_ and _cedarn_ (l. 990), _hornen_, _treen_, _corden_,\n_glassen_, _reeden_, etc., are practically obsolete; see Trench,\n_English Past and Present_. Comp. 'oaten' (_Lyc._ 33), 'oaken' (_Arc._\n45). As the words 'azurn' and 'cedarn' are peculiar to Milton some hold\nthat he adopted them from the Italian _azzurino_ and _cedrino_.\n\n894. ~turkis~; also spelt turkoise, turquois, and turquoise: lit. 'the\nTurkish stone,' a Persian gem so called because it came through Turkey\n(Pers. _turk_, a Turk).\n\n895. ~That ... strays~. Milton does not imply that these stones were\nfound in the Severn, nor does he in lines 932-937 imply that cinnamon\ngrows on its banks.\n\n897. ~printless feet~. Comp. _Temp._ v. i. 34: \"Ye that on the sands with\n_printless foot_ Do chase the ebbing Neptune\"; also _Arc._ 85: \"Where no\nprint of step hath been.\"\n\n902. It will be noticed that the Spirit takes up the rhymes of Sabrina's\nsong ('here,' 'dear'; 'request,' 'distressed'), and again Sabrina\ncontinues the rhymes of the Spirit's song ('distressed,' 'best').\n\n913. ~of precious cure~, of curative power. See note on this use of 'of,'\nl. 155.\n\n914. References to the efficacy of sprinkling are frequent, _e.g._ in\nthe English Bible, in Spenser, in Virgil (_Aen._ vi. 229), in Ovid\n(_Met._ iv. 479), in _Par. Lost_, xi. 416.\n\n916. ~Next~: an adverb modifying 'touch.'\n\n917. ~glutinous~, sticky, viscous. The epithet is transferred from the\neffect to the cause.\n\n921. ~Amphitrite~: the wife of Neptune (Poseidon) and goddess of the Sea.\n\n923. ~Anchises line~: see note, l. 827. Locrine was the son of Brutus, who\nwas the son of Silvius, who was the grandson of the great Aeneas, who\nwas the son of old Anchises.\n\n924. ~may ... miss~. This verb is optative: so are '(may) scorch,' '(may)\nfill,' 'may roll,' and 'may be crowned.'\n\n925. ~brimm\u00c3\u00a8d~. The passive participle is so often used where we now use\nthe active that 'brimmed' may mean 'brimming' = full to the brim. On the\nother hand, 'brim' is frequent in the sense of _bank_ (comp. l. 119), so\nthat some regard 'brimmed' as = enclosed within banks.\n\n928. ~sing\u00c3\u00a8d~, scorched. We should rather say 'scorching.' On the good\nwishes expressed in lines 924-937 Masson's comment is: \"The whole of\nthis poetic blessing on the Severn and its neighbourhood, involving the\nwish of what we should call 'solid commercial prosperity,' would go to\nthe heart of the assemblage at Ludlow.\"\n\n933. ~beryl~: in the Bible (_Rev._ xxi. 20) this precious stone forms one\nof the foundations of the New Jerusalem. The word is of Eastern origin:\ncomp. Arab, _billaur_, crystal. ~golden ore~. As a matter of fact gold has\nbeen found in the Welsh mountains.\n\n934. ~May thy lofty head~, etc. The grammatical construction is: 'May thy\nlofty head be crowned round with many a tower and terrace, and here and\nthere (may thy lofty head be crowned) with groves of myrrh and cinnamon\n(growing) upon thy banks.' This makes 'banks' objective, and 'upon' a\npreposition: the only objection to this reading is that the notion of\ncrowning the head upon the banks is peculiar. The difficulty vanishes\nwhen we recollect that Milton frequently connects two clauses with one\nsubject rather loosely: the subject of the second clause is 'thou,'\nimplied in 'thy lofty head.' An exact parallel to this is found in\n_L'Alleg._ 121, 122: 'whose bright eyes rain influence and _judge_ the\nprize'; also in _Il Pens._ 155-7; 'let my due feet never fail to _walk\n... and love_, etc.': also in _Lyc._ 88, 89. The explanation adopted by\nProf. Masson is that Milton had in view two Greek verbs--\u00cf\u0080\u00ce\u00b5\u00cf\u0081\u00ce\u00b9\u00cf\u0083\u00cf\u0084\u00ce\u00b5\u00cf\u0086\u00ce\u00b1\u00ce\u00bd\u00e1\u00bd\u00b9\u00cf\u0089,\n'to put a crown round,' and \u00e1\u00bc\u0090\u00cf\u0080\u00ce\u00b9\u00cf\u0083\u00cf\u0084\u00ce\u00b5\u00cf\u0086\u00ce\u00b1\u00ce\u00bd\u00e1\u00bd\u00b9\u00cf\u0089, \"to put a crown upon\": thus,\n\"May thy lofty head be _crowned round_ with many a tower and terrace,\nand thy banks here and there be _crowned upon_ with groves of myrrh and\ncinnamon.\" This makes 'banks' nominative, and 'upon' an adverb.\n\nIn the Bridgewater MS. the stage direction here is, _Song ends_.\n\n942. ~Not a waste~, etc., _i.e._ 'Let there not be a superfluous or\nunnecessary sound until we come.' 'waste' is an attributive: see note,\nl. 728.\n\n945. ~gloomy covert wide~: see note, l. 207.\n\n946. ~not many furlongs~. These words are deliberately inserted to keep up\nthe illusion. It is probable that, in the actual representation of the\nmask, the scene representing the enchanted palace was removed when\nComus's rout was driven off the stage, and a woodland scene redisplayed.\nThis would give additional significance to these lines and to the change\nof scene after l. 957. 'Furlong' = furrow-long: it thus came to mean the\nlength of a field, and is now a measure of length.\n\n949. ~many a friend~. 'Many a' is a peculiar idiom, which has been\nexplained in different ways. One view is that 'many' is a corruption of\nthe French _mesnie_, a train or company, and 'a' a corruption of the\npreposition 'of,' the singular noun being then substituted for the\nplural through confusion of the preposition with the article. A more\ncorrect view seems to be that 'many' is the A.S. _manig_, which was in\nold English used with a singular noun and without the article, _e.g._\n_manig mann_ = many men. In the thirteenth century the indefinite\narticle began to be inserted; thus _mony enne thing_ = many a thing,\njust as we say 'what _a_ thing,' 'such _a_ thing.' This would seem to\nshow that 'a' is not a corruption of 'of,' and that there is no\nconnection with the French word _mesnie_. Milton, in this passage, uses\n'many a friend' with a plural verb. ~gratulate~. The simple verb is now\nreplaced by the compound _congratulate_ (Lat. _gratulari_, to wish joy\nto a person).\n\n950. ~wished~, _i.e._ wished for; see note, l. 574. ~and beside~, _i.e._\n'and where, besides,' etc.\n\n952. ~jigs~, lively dances.\n\n958. ~Back, shepherds, back!~ On the rising of the curtain, the stage is\noccupied by peasants engaged in a merry dance. Soon after the attendant\nSpirit enters with the above words. ~Enough your play~, _i.e._ we have had\nenough of your dancing, which must now give way to 'other trippings.'\n\n959. ~sunshine holiday~. Comp. _L'Alleg._ 98, where the same expression is\nused. There is a close resemblance between the language of this song and\nlines 91-99 of _L'Allegro_. Milton's own spelling of 'holiday' is\n'holyday,' which shows the origin of the word. The accent in such\ncompounds (comp. blue-bell, blackbird, etc.) falls on the adjective: it\nis only in this way that the ear can tell whether the compound forms\n(_e.g._ h\u00c3\u00b3liday) or the separate words (_e.g._ h\u00c3\u00b3ly d\u00c3\u00a1y) are being used.\n\n960. ~Here be~: see note, l. 12. ~without duck or nod~: words used to\ndescribe the ungraceful dancing and awkward courtesy of the country\npeople.\n\n961. ~trippings ... lighter toes ... court guise~: words used to describe\nthe graceful movements of the Lady and her brothers: comp. _L'Alleg._\n33: \"trip it, as you go, On the light fantastic toe.\" _Trod_ (or\ntrodden), past participle of _tread_: 'to tread a measure' is a common\nexpression, meaning 'to dance.' 'Court guise,' _i.e._ courtly mien;\n_guise_ is a doublet of _wise_ = way, _e.g._ 'in this wise,'\n'like_wise_,' 'other_wise_.' In such pairs of words as _guise_ and\n_wise_, _guard_ and _ward_, _guile_ and _wile_, the forms in _gu_ have\ncome into English through the French.\n\n963. ~Mercury~ (the Greek Hermes) was the herald of the gods, and as such\nwas represented as having winged ankles (Gk. \u00cf\u0080\u00cf\u0084\u00ce\u00b7\u00ce\u00bd\u00ce\u00bf\u00cf\u0080\u00e1\u00bd\u00b3\u00ce\u00b4\u00ce\u00b9\u00ce\u00bb\u00ce\u00bf\u00cf\u0082): his name is\nhere used as a synonym both for agility and refinement.\n\n964. ~mincing Dryades~. The Dryades are wood-nymphs (Gk. \u00ce\u00b4\u00cf\u0081\u00e1\u00bf\u00a6\u00cf\u0082, a\ntree), here represented as mincing, _i.e._ tripping with short steps,\nunlike the clumsy striding of the country people. Comp. _Merch. of V._\niii. 4. 67: \"turn two _mincing_ steps Into a manly stride.\" Applied to a\nperson's gait (or speech), the word now implies affectation.\n\n965. ~lawns ... leas~. On 'lawn,' see note, l. 568: a 'lea' is a meadow.\n\n966. This song is sung by Lawes while presenting the three young persons\nto the Earl and Countess of Bridgewater.\n\n967. ~ye~: see note, l. 216.\n\n968. ~so goodly grown~, _i.e._ grown so goodly. _Goodly_ = handsome (A.S.\n_g\u00c3\u00b3dlic_ = goodlike).\n\n970. ~timely~. Here an adverb: in l. 689 it is an adjective. Comp. the two\nphrases in _Macbeth_: \"To gain the _timely_ inn,\" iii. 3. 7; and \"To\ncall _timely_ on him,\" ii. 3. 51.\n\n972. ~assays~, trials, temptations. _Assay_ is used by Milton in the\nsense of 'attempt' as well as of 'trial': see _Arc._ 80, \"I will\n_assay_, her worth to celebrate.\" The former meaning is now confined to\nthe form _essay_ (radically the same word); and the use of _assay_ has\nbeen still further restricted from its being used chiefly of the testing\nof metals. Comp. _Par. Lost_, iv. 932, \"hard _assays_ and ill\nsuccesses\"; _Par. Reg._ i. 264, iv. 478.\n\n974, 5. ~To triumph~. The whole purpose of the poem is succinctly\nexpressed in these lines. _Stage Direction_: ~Spirit epiloguizes~, _i.e._\nsings the epilogue or concluding stanzas. In one of Lawes' manuscripts\nof the mask, the epilogue consists of twelve lines only, those numbered\n1012-1023. From the same copy we find that line 976 had been altered by\nLawes in such a manner as to convert the first part of the epilogue into\na prologue which, in his character as Attendant Spirit, he sang whilst\ndescending upon the stage:--\n\n    _From the heavens_ now I fly,\n    And those happy climes that lie\n    Where day never shuts his eye,\n    Up in the broad _field_ of the sky.\n    There I suck the liquid air\n    All amidst the gardens fair\n    Of Hesperus, and his daughters three\n    That sing about the golden tree.\n    There eternal summer dwells,\n    And west winds, with musky wing,\n    About the cedarn alleys fling\n    Nard and cassia's balmy smells.\n    Iris there with humid bow\n    Waters the odorous banks, that blow\n    Flowers of more mingled hue\n    Than her purfled scarf can show,\n    _Yellow, watchet, green, and blue_,\n    And drenches oft with _Manna_ dew\n    Beds of hyacinth and roses,\n    Where _many a cherub soft_ reposes.\n\nDoubtless this was the arrangement in the actual performance of the\nmask.\n\n976. ~To the ocean~, etc. The resemblance of this song, in rhythm and\nrhyme, to the song of Ariel in the _Tempest_, v. 1. 88-94, has been\nfrequently pointed out: \"Where the bee sucks, there suck I,\" etc.\nCompare also the song of Johphiel in _The Fortunate Isles_ (Ben Jonson):\n\"Like a lightning from the sky,\" etc. The epilogue as sung by Lawes (ll.\n1012-1023) may also be compared with the epilogue of the _Tempest_: \"Now\nmy charms are all o'erthrown,\" etc.\n\n977. ~happy climes~. Comp. _Odyssey_, iv. 566: \"The deathless gods will\nconvey thee to the Elysian plain and the world's end ... where life is\neasiest for men. No snow is there, nor yet great storm, nor any rain;\nbut always ocean sendeth forth the breeze of the shrill west to blow\ncool on men\": see also l. 14. 'Clime,' radically the same as _climate_,\nis still used in its literal sense = a region of the earth; while\n'climate' has the secondary meaning of 'atmospheric conditions.' Comp.\n_Son._ viii. 8: \"Whatever _clime_ the sun's bright circle warms.\"\n\n978. ~day ... eye~. Comp. _Son._ i. 5: \"the _eye_ of day\"; and _Lyc._ 26:\n\"the opening _eyelids_ of the Morn.\"\n\n979. ~broad fields of the sky~. Comp. Virgil's \"_A\u00c3\u00abris in campis latis_,\"\n_Aen._ vi. 888.\n\n980. ~suck the liquid air~, inhale the pure air. 'Liquid' (lit. flowing)\nis used figuratively and generally in the sense of pure and sweet: comp.\n_Son._ i. 5, \"thy liquid notes.\"\n\n981. ~All amidst~. For this adverbial use of _all_ (here modifying the\nfollowing prepositional phrase), compare _Il Pens._ 33, \"_all_ in a robe\nof darkest grain.\"\n\n982. ~Hesperus~: see note, l. 393. Hesperus, the brother of Atlas, had\nthree daughters--Aegle, Cynthia, and Hesperia. They were famed for their\nsweet song. In Milton's MS. _Hesperus_ is written over _Atlas_: Spenser\nmakes them daughters of Atlas, as does Jonson in _Pleasure reconciled to\nVirtue_.\n\n984. ~crisp\u00c3\u00a9d shades~. 'Crisped,' like 'curled' (comp. \"curl the grove,\"\n_Arc._ 46) is a common expression in the poetry of the time, and has the\nsame meaning. The original form is the adjective 'crisp' (Lat. _crispus_\n= curled), from which comes the verb _to crisp_ and the participle\n_crisped_. Compare \"the _crisped_ brooks ... ran nectar,\" _Par. Lost_,\niv. 237, where the word is best rendered 'rippled'; also Tennyson's\n_Claribel_, 19, \"the babbling runnel _crispeth_.\" In the present case\nthe reference is to the foliage of the trees.\n\n985. ~spruce~, gay. This word, now applied to persons with a touch of\nlevity, was formerly used both of things and persons in the sense of gay\nor neat. Compare the present and earlier uses of the word _jolly_, on\nwhich Pattison says:--\"This is an instance of the disadvantage under\nwhich poetry in a living language labours. No knowledge of the meaning\nwhich a word bore in 1631 can wholly banish the later and vulgar\nassociations which may have gathered round it since. Apart from direct\nparody and burlesque, the tendency of living speech is gradually to\ndegrade the noble; so that as time goes on the range of poetical\nexpression grows from generation to generation more and more\nrestricted.\" The origin of the word _spruce_ is disputed: Skeat holds\nthat it is a corruption of Pruce (old Fr. _Pruce_, mod. Fr. _Prusse_) =\nPrussia; we read in the 14th century of persons dressed after the\nfashion of Prussia or Spruce, and Prussia was called Sprussia by some\nEnglish writers up to the beginning of the 17th century. See also\nTrench, _Select Glossary_.\n\n986. ~The Graces~. The three Graces of classical mythology were Euphrosyne\n(the light-hearted one), Aglaia (the bright one), and Thalia (the\nblooming one). See _L'Alleg._ 12: \"Euphrosyne ... Whom lovely Venus, at\na birth, With two sister Graces more, To ivy-crown\u00c3\u00a8d Bacchus bore.\" They\nwere sometimes represented as daughters of Zeus, and as the goddesses\nwho purified and enhanced all the innocent pleasures of life.\n~rosy-bosomed Hours~. The Hours (Hor\u00c3\u00a6) of classical mythology were the\ngoddesses of the Seasons, whose course was described as the dance of the\nHor\u00c3\u00a6. The Hora of Spring accompanied Persephone every year on her ascent\nfrom the lower world, and the expression \"The chamber of the Hor\u00c3\u00a6 opens\"\nis equivalent to \"The Spring is coming.\" 'Rosy-bosomed'; the Gk.\n\u00e1\u00bf\u00a5\u00ce\u00bf\u00ce\u00b4\u00e1\u00bd\u00b9\u00ce\u00ba\u00ce\u00bf\u00ce\u00bb\u00cf\u0080\u00ce\u00bf\u00cf\u0082: compare the epithets 'rosy-fingered' (applied by Homer to\nthe dawn), 'rosy-armed,' etc.\n\n989. ~musky ... fling~. Compare _Par. Lost_, viii. 515: \"Fresh gales and\ngentle airs Whispered it to the woods, and from their wings Flung rose,\nflung odours from the spicy shrub.\" In this passage the verb _fling_ is\nsimilarly used. 'Musky' = fragrant: comp. 'musk-rose,' l. 496.\n\n990. ~cedarn alleys~, _i.e._ alleys of cedar trees. For 'alley,' comp. l.\n311. For the form of 'cedarn,' see note on 'azurn,' l. 893. Tennyson\nuses the word 'cedarn' in _Recoll. of Arab. Nights_, 115.\n\n991. ~Nard and cassia~; two aromatic plants. Cassia is a name sometimes\napplied to the wild cinnamon: nard is also called _spike-nard_; see\nallusion in the Bible, _Mark_, xiv. 3; _Exod._ xxx. 24, etc.\n\n992. ~Iris ... humid bow~: see note, l. 83. The allusion is, of course, to\nthe rainbow.\n\n993. ~blow~, here used actively = cause to blossom: comp. Jonson, _Mask at\nHighgate_, \"For thee, Favonius, here shall _blow_ New flowers.\"\n\n995. ~purfled~ = having an embroidered edge (O.F. _pourfiler_): the verb\n_to purfle_ survives in the contracted form _to purl_, and is cognate\nwith profile = a front line or edge. ~shew~: here rhymes with _dew_; comp.\nl. 511, 512. This points to the fact that in Milton's time the present\npronunciation of _shew_, though familiar, was not the only one\nrecognised.\n\n996. ~drenches with Elysian dew~, _i.e._ soaks with heavenly dew. The\nHomeric Elysium is described in _Odyssey_, iv.: see note, l. 977; it\nwas afterwards identified with the abode of the blessed, l. 257.\n_Drench_ is the causative of _drink_: here the nominative of the verb is\n'Iris' and the object 'beds.'\n\n997. ~if your ears be true~, _i.e._ if your ears be pure: the poet is\nabout to speak of that which cannot be understood by those with \"gross\nunpurg\u00c3\u00a8d ear\" (_Arc._ 73, and _Com._ l. 458). He alludes to that pure\nLove which \"leads up to Heaven,\" _Par. Lost_, viii. 612.\n\n998. ~hyacinth~. This is the \"sanguine flower inscribed with woe\" of\n_Lycidas_, 106: it sprang from the blood of Hyacinthus, a youth beloved\nby Apollo.\n\n999. ~Adonis~, the beloved of Venus, died of a wound which he received\nfrom a boar during the chase. The grief of Venus was so great that the\ngods of the lower world allowed him to spend six months of every year on\nearth. The story is of Asiatic origin, and is supposed to be symbolic of\nthe revival of nature in spring and its death in winter. Comp. _Par.\nLost_, ix. 439, \"those gardens feigned Or of revived Adonis,\" etc.\n\n1000. ~waxing well of~, _i.e._ recovering from. The A.S. _weaxan_ = to\ngrow or increase: Shakespeare has 'man of wax' = adult, _Rom. and Jul._\ni. 3. 76; see also Index to Globe _Shakespeare_.\n\n1002. ~Assyrian queen~, _i.e._ Venus, whose worship came from the East,\nprobably from Assyria. She was originally identical with Astarte, called\nby the Hebrews Ashteroth: see _Par. Lost_, i. 438-452, where Adonis\nappears as Thammuz.\n\n1003, 4. ~far above ... advanced~. These words are to be read together:\n'advanced' is an attribute to 'Cupid,' and is modified by 'far above.'\n\n1003. ~spangled sheen~, glittering brightness. 'Spangled': _spangle_ is a\ndiminutive of _spang_ = a metal clasp, and hence 'a shining ornament.'\nIn poetry it is common to speak of the stars as 'spangles' and of the\nheavens as 'spangled': comp. Addison's well-known lines:\n\n    \"The spacious firmament on high,\n    With all the blue ethereal sky,\n    And _spangled_ heavens, a shining frame,\n    Their great Original proclaim.\"\n\nComp. also _Lyc._ 170, \"with _new-spangled_ ore.\" 'Sheen' is here used\nas a noun, as in line 893; also in _Hymn Nat._ 145, \"throned in\ncelestial _sheen_\": _Epitaph on M. of W._ 73, \"clad in radiant _sheen_.\"\nThe word occurs in Spenser as an adjective also: comp. \"her dainty corse\nso fair and _sheen_,\" _F. Q._ ii. 1. 10. In the line \"By fountain clear\nor spangled starlight _sheen_\" (_M. N. D._ ii. l. 29) it is doubtful\nwhether the word is a noun or an adjective. Milton uses the adjective\n_sheeny_ (_Death of Fair Infant_, 48).\n\n1004. ~Celestial Cupid~. The ordinary view of Cupid is given in the note\nto line 445; here he is the lover of Psyche (the human soul) to whom he\nis united after she has been purified by a life of trial and misfortune.\nThe myth of Cupid and Psyche is as follows: Cupid was in love with\nPsyche, but warned her that she must not seek to know who he was.\nYielding to curiosity, however, she drew near to him with a lamp while\nhe was asleep. A drop of the hot oil falling on him, he awoke, and fled\nfrom her. She now wandered from place to place, persecuted by Venus; but\nafter great sorrow, during which she was secretly supported by Cupid,\nshe became immortal and was united to him for ever. In this story Psyche\nrepresents the human soul (Gk. \u00cf\u0088\u00cf\u0085\u00cf\u0087\u00e1\u00bd\u00b5), which is disciplined and purified\nby earthly misfortune and so fitted for the enjoyment of true happiness\nin heaven. Further, in Milton's Allegory it is only the soul so purified\nthat is capable of knowing true love: in his _Apology for Smectymnuus_\nhe calls it that Love \"whose charming cup is only virtue,\" and whose\n\"first and chiefest office ... begins and ends in the soul, producing\nthose happy twins of her divine generation, Knowledge and Virtue.\" To\nthis high and mystical love Milton again alludes in _Epitaphium Damonis_:\n\n    \"In other part, the expansive vault above,\n    And there too, even there the god of love;\n    With quiver armed he mounts, his torch displays\n    A vivid light, his gem-tipt arrows blaze,\n    Around his bright and fiery eyes he rolls,\n    Nor aims at vulgar minds or little souls,\n    Nor deigns one look below, but aiming high\n    Sends every arrow to the lofty sky;\n    Hence forms divine, and minds immortal, learn\n    The power of Cupid, and enamoured burn.\"\n\n    _Cowper's translation._\n\n1007. ~among~: preposition governing 'gods.'\n\n1008. ~make~: subjunctive after 'till.' Its nominative is 'consent.'\n\n1010. ~blissful~, blest. _Bliss_ is cognate with _bless_ and _blithe_.\nComp. \"the _blest_ kingdoms meek of joy and love,\" _Lyc._ 177. ~are to be\nborn~. There seems to be here a confusion of constructions between the\nsubjunctive co-ordinate with _make_ and the indicative dependent in\nmeaning on \"Jove hath sworn\" in the following line.\n\n1011. ~Youth and Joy~. Everlasting youth and joy are found only after the\ntrials of earth are past. So Spenser makes Pleasure the daughter of\nCupid and Psyche, but she is \"the daughter late,\" _i.e._ she is possible\nonly to the purified soul. See also note on l. 1004.\n\n1012. ~my task~, _i.e._ the task alluded to in line 18. This line is an\nadverbial clause = Now that (or _because_) my task is smoothly done.\n\n1013. The Spirit's task being finished he is free to soar where he\npleases. There seems to be implied the injunction that mankind can by\nvirtue alone attain to the same spiritual freedom.\n\n1014. ~green earth's end~. The world as known to the ancients did not\nextend much beyond the Straits of Gibraltar. The Cape Verd Islands,\nwhich lie outside these straits, may be here referred to: comp. _Par.\nLost_, viii. 630:\n\n    \"But I can now no more; the parting sun\n    Beyond the earth's green Cape and Verdant Isles\n    Hesperean sets, my signal to depart.\"\n\n1015. ~bowed welkin~: the meaning of the line is, \"Where the arched sky\ncurves slowly towards the horizon.\" _Welkin_ is, radically, \"the region\nof clouds,\" A.S. _wolcnu_, clouds.\n\n1017. ~corners of the moon~, _i.e._ its horns. The crescent moon is said\nto be 'horned' (Lat. _cornu_, a horn). Comp. the lines in _Macbeth_,\niii. 5. 23, 24: \"Upon the corners of the moon There hangs a vaporous\ndrop profound.\"\n\n1020. ~She can teach ye how to climb~, etc. Compare Jonson's song to\nVirtue:\n\n        \"Though a stranger here on earth\n    In heaven she hath her right of birth.\n        There, there is Virtue's seat:\n        Strive to keep her your own;\n        'Tis only she can make you great,\n    Though place here make you known.\"\n\n1021. ~sphery chime~, _i.e._ the music of the spheres. \"To climb higher\nthan the sphery chime\" means to ascend beyond the spheres into the\nempyrean or true heaven--the abode of God and the purest Spirits. Milton\ntherefore implies that by virtue alone can we come into God's presence.\nSee note on \"the starry quire,\" line 112. 'Chime' is strictly 'harmony,'\nas in \"silver _chime_,\" _Hymn Nat._ 128: the word is cognate with\n_cymbal_.\n\n1022, 3. ~if Virtue feeble were~, etc. A triumphant expression of that\nconfidence in the invincibleness of virtue, when aided by Divine\nProvidence, and therefore a fitting conclusion of the whole masque.\nMilton's whole life reveals his unshaken belief in the truth expressed\nin the last two lines of his _Comus_.\n\n\n\n\nINDEX TO THE NOTES.\n\n\nA.\n\nAcheron, 604.\n\nAdonis, 999.\n\nAdventurous, 79.\n\nAdvice, 108;\n  advised, 755.\n\nAffects, 386.\n\nAlabaster, 660.\n\nAll,

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":334,"split":"train"}
