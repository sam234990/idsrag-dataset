{"ori_id":"caf0ab019a350015cf49332baf41bdce16c4bfa7","title":"Medea (play)","context":"Medea (play)\n Medea is centered on a wife\u2019s calculated desire for revenge against her unfaithful husband. The play is set in Corinth some time after Jason's quest for the Golden Fleece, where he met Medea. The play begins with Medea raging at Jason for arranging to marry Glauce, the daughter of Creon (king of Corinth). The nurse, overhearing Medea\u2019s grief, fears what she might do to herself or her children.\nCreon, in anticipation of Medea\u2019s wrath, arrives and reveals his plans to send her into exile. Medea pleads for one day\u2019s delay and eventually Creon acquiesces. In the next scene Jason arrives to explain his rationale for his apparent betrayal. He explains that he couldn\u2019t pass up the opportunity to marry a royal princess, as Medea is only a barbarian woman, but hopes to someday join the two families and keep Medea as his mistress. Medea, and the chorus of Corinthian women, do not believe him. She reminds him that she left her own people for him (\"I am the mother of your children. Whither can I fly, since all Greece hates the barbarian?\"), and that she saved him and slew the dragon. Jason promises to support her after his new marriage, but Medea spurns him: \"Marry the maid if thou wilt; perchance full soon thou mayst rue thy nuptials.\"\nIn the following scene Medea encounters Aegeus, King of Athens. He reveals to her that despite his marriage to his wife he is still without children. He visited the oracle who merely told him that he was instructed \u201cnot to unstop the wineskin\u2019s neck.\u201d Medea relays her current situation to him and begs for Aegeus to let her stay in Athens if she gives him drugs to end his infertility. Aegeus, unaware of Medea\u2019s plans for revenge, agrees.\nMedea then returns to plotting the murders of Glauce and Creon. She decides to poison some golden robes (a family heirloom and gift from the sun god Helios) and a coronet, in hopes that the bride will not be able to resist wearing them, and consequently be poisoned. Medea resolves to kill her own children as well, not because the children have done anything wrong, but because she feels it is the best way to hurt Jason. She calls for Jason once more and, in an elaborate ruse, apologizes to him for overreacting to his decision to marry Glauce. When Jason appears fully convinced that she regrets her actions, Medea begins to cry in mourning of her exile. She convinces Jason to allow her to give the robes to Glauce in hopes that Glauce might get Creon to lift the exile. Eventually Jason agrees and allows their children to deliver the poisoned robes as the gift-bearers.\nForgive what I said in anger! I will yield to the decree, and only beg one favor, that my children may stay. They shall take to the princess a costly robe and a golden crown, and pray for her protection.\nIn the next scene a messenger recounts Glauce and Creon\u2019s deaths. When the children arrived with the robes and coronet Glauce put them on gleefully and went to find her father. Soon the poisons overtook Glauce and she fell to the floor, quickly dying. Creon clutched her tightly as he tried to save her and, by coming in contact with the robes and coronet, got poisoned and died as well.\nAlas! The bride had died in horrible agony; for no sooner had she put on Medea's gifts than a devouring poison consumed her limbs as with fire, and in his endeavor to save his daughter the old father died too.\nWhile Medea is content with her current success she decides to take it one step forward. Since Jason brought shame upon her for trying to start a new family, Medea resolves to destroy the family he was willing to give up by killing their sons. Medea does have a moment of hesitation when she considers the pain that her children\u2019s deaths will put her through. However, she steels her resolve to cause Jason the most pain possible and rushes offstage with a knife to kill her children. As the chorus laments her decision, the children are heard screaming. Jason then rushes onto the scene to confront Medea about murdering Creon and Glauce and he quickly discovers that his children have been killed as well. Medea then appears above the stage with the bodies of her children in the chariot of the sun god Helios. When this play was put on, this scene was accomplished using the mechane device usually reserved for the appearance of a god or goddess. She confronts Jason, reveling in his pain at being unable to ever hold his children again:\n\"I do not leave my children's bodies with thee; I take them with me that I may bury them in Hera's precinct. And for thee, who didst me all that evil, I prophesy an evil doom.\"\nShe escapes to Athens with the bodies. The chorus is left contemplating the will of Zeus in Medea's actions:\nManifold are thy shapings, Providence!\nMany a hopeless matter gods arrange.\nWhat we expected never came to pass,\nWhat we did not expect the gods brought to bear;\nSo have things gone, this whole experience through!\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Medea of Euripides, by Euripides\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

It deals,\nso to speak, not with the romance itself, but with the end of the\nromance, a thing which is so terribly often the reverse of romantic. For\nall but the very highest of romances are apt to have just one flaw\nsomewhere, and in the story of Jason and Medea the flaw was of a fatal\nkind.\n\nThe wildness and beauty of the Argo legend run through all Greek\nliterature, from the mass of Corinthian lays older than our present\nIliad, which later writers vaguely associate with the name of Eum\u00c3\u00aalus,\nto the Fourth Pythian Ode of Pindar and the beautiful Argonautica of\nApollonius Rhodius. Our poet knows the wildness and the beauty; but it\nis not these qualities that he specially seeks. He takes them almost for\ngranted, and pierces through them to the sheer tragedy that lies below.\n\nJason, son of Aeson, King of I\u00c3\u00b4lcos, in Thessaly, began his life in\nexile. His uncle Pelias had seized his father's kingdom, and Jason was\nborne away to the mountains by night and given, wrapped in a purple\nrobe, to Chiron, the Centaur. When he reached manhood he came down to\nI\u00c3\u00b4lcos to demand, as Pindar tells us, his ancestral honour, and stood in\nthe market-place, a world-famous figure, one-sandalled, with his\npard-skin, his two spears and his long hair, gentle and wild and\nfearless, as the Wise Beast had reared him. Pelias, cowed but loath to\nyield, promised to give up the kingdom if Jason would make his way to\nthe unknown land of Colchis and perform a double quest. First, if I read\nPindar aright, he must fetch back the soul of his kinsman Phrixus, who\nhad died there far from home; and, secondly, find the fleece of the\nGolden Ram which Phrixus had sacrificed. Jason undertook the quest:\ngathered the most daring heroes from all parts of Hellas; built the\nfirst ship, Argo, and set to sea. After all manner of desperate\nadventures he reached the land of Ai\u00c3\u00aat\u00c3\u00aas, king of the Colchians, and\nthere hope failed him. By policy, by tact, by sheer courage he did all\nthat man could do. But Ai\u00c3\u00aat\u00c3\u00aas was both hostile and treacherous. The\nArgonauts were surrounded, and their destruction seemed only a question\nof days when, suddenly, unasked, and by the mercy of Heaven, Ai\u00c3\u00aat\u00c3\u00aas'\ndaughter, M\u00c3\u00aad\u00c3\u00aaa, an enchantress as well as a princess, fell in love with\nJason. She helped him through all his trials; slew for him her own\nsleepless serpent, who guarded the fleece; deceived her father, and\nsecured both the fleece and the soul of Phrixus. At the last moment it\nappeared that her brother, Absyrtus, was about to lay an ambush for\nJason. She invited Absyrtus to her room, stabbed him dead, and fled with\nJason over the seas. She had given up all, and expected in return a\nperfect love.\n\nAnd what of Jason? He could not possibly avoid taking Medea with him. He\nprobably rather loved her. She formed at the least a brilliant addition\nto the glory of his enterprise. Not many heroes could produce a\nbarbarian princess ready to leave all and follow them in blind trust.\nFor of course, as every one knew without the telling in fifth-century\nAthens, no legal marriage was possible between a Greek and a barbarian\nfrom Colchis.\n\nAll through the voyage home, a world-wide baffled voyage by the Ister\nand the Eridanus and the African Syrtes, Medea was still in her element,\nand proved a constant help and counsellor to the Argonauts. When they\nreached Jason's home, where Pelias was still king, things began to be\ndifferent. An ordered and law-abiding Greek state was scarcely the place\nfor the untamed Colchian. We only know the catastrophe. She saw with\nsmothered rage how Pelias hated Jason and was bent on keeping the\nkingdom from him, and she determined to do her lover another act of\nsplendid service. Making the most of her fame as an enchantress, she\npersuaded Pelias that he could, by a certain process, regain his youth.\nHe eagerly caught at the hope. His daughters tried the process upon him,\nand Pelias died in agony. Surely Jason would be grateful now!\n\nThe real result was what it was sure to be in a civilised country. Medea\nand her lover had to fly for their lives, and Jason was debarred for\never from succeeding to the throne of I\u00c3\u00b4lcos. Probably there was another\nresult also in Jason's mind: the conclusion that at all costs he must\nsomehow separate himself from this wild beast of a woman who was ruining\nhis life. He directed their flight to Corinth, governed at the time by a\nruler of some sort, whether \"tyrant\" or king, who was growing old and\nhad an only daughter. Creon would naturally want a son-in-law to support\nand succeed him. And where in all Greece could he find one stronger or\nmore famous than the chief of the Argonauts? If only Medea were not\nthere! No doubt Jason owed her a great debt for her various services.\nStill, after all, he was not married to her. And a man must not be weak\nin such matters as these. Jason accepted the princess's hand, and when\nMedea became violent, found it difficult to be really angry with Creon\nfor instantly condemning her to exile. At this point the tragedy begins.\n\nThe _Medea_ is one of the earliest of Euripides' works now preserved to\nus. And those of us who have in our time glowed at all with the religion\nof realism, will probably feel in it many of the qualities of youth.\nNot, of course, the more normal, sensuous, romantic youth, the youth of\n_Romeo and Juliet_; but another kind--crude, austere, passionate--the\nyouth of the poet who is also a sceptic and a devotee of truth, who so\nhates the conventionally and falsely beautiful that he is apt to be\nunduly ascetic towards beauty itself. When a writer really deficient in\npoetry walks in this path, the result is purely disagreeable. It\nproduces its best results when the writer, like Euripides or Tolstoy, is\nso possessed by an inward flame of poetry that it breaks out at the\ngreat moments and consumes the cramping theory that would hold it in.\nOne can feel in the _Medea_ that the natural and inevitable romance of\nthe story is kept rigidly down. One word about Medea's ancient serpent,\ntwo or three references to the Clashing Rocks, one startling flash of\nlight upon the real love of Jason's life, love for the ship Argo, these\nare almost all the concessions made to us by the merciless delineator\nof disaster into whose hands we are fallen. Jason is a middle-aged man,\nwith much glory, indeed, and some illusions; but a man entirely set upon\nbuilding up a great career, to whom love and all its works, though at\ntimes he has found them convenient, are for the most part only\nirrational and disturbing elements in a world which he can otherwise\nmould to his will. And yet, most cruel touch of all, one feels this man\nto be the real Jason. It is not that he has fallen from his heroic past.\nIt is that he was really like this always. And so with Medea. It is not\nonly that her beauty has begun to fade; not only that she is set in\nsurroundings which vaguely belittle and weaken her, making her no more a\nbountiful princess, but only an ambiguous and much criticised foreigner.\nHer very devotion of love for Jason, now turned to hatred, shows itself\nto have been always of that somewhat rank and ugly sort to which such a\nchange is natural.\n\nFor concentrated dramatic quality and sheer intensity of passion few\nplays ever written can vie with the _Medea_. Yet it obtained only a\nthird prize at its first production; and, in spite of its immense fame,\nthere are not many scholars who would put it among their favourite\ntragedies. The comparative failure of the first production was perhaps\ndue chiefly to the extreme originality of the play. The Athenians in 432\nB.C. had not yet learnt to understand or tolerate such work as this,\nthough it is likely enough that they fortified their unfavourable\nopinion by the sort of criticisms which we still find attributed to\nAristotle and Dic\u00c3\u00a6archus.\n\nAt the present time it is certainly not the newness of the subject: I do\nnot think it is Aegeus, nor yet the dragon chariot, much less Medea's\ninvoluntary burst of tears in the second scene with Jason, that really\nproduces the feeling of dissatisfaction with which many people must rise\nfrom this great play. It is rather the general scheme on which the drama\nis built. It is a scheme which occurs again and again in Euripides, a\nstudy of oppression and revenge. Such a subject in the hands of a more\nordinary writer would probably take the form of a triumph of oppressed\nvirtue. But Euripides gives us nothing so sympathetic, nothing so cheap\nand unreal. If oppression usually made people virtuous, the problems of\nthe world would be very different from what they are. Euripides seems at\ntimes to hate the revenge of the oppressed almost as much as the\noriginal cruelty of the oppressor; or, to put the same fact in a\ndifferent light, he seems deliberately to dwell upon the twofold evil of\ncruelty, that it not only causes pain to the victim, but actually by\nmeans of the pain makes him a worse man, so that when his turn of\ntriumph comes, it is no longer a triumph of justice or a thing to make\nmen rejoice. This is a grim lesson; taught often enough by history,\nthough seldom by the fables of the poets.\n\nSeventeen years later than the _Medea_ Euripides expressed this\nsentiment in a more positive way in the _Trojan Women_, where a depth of\nwrong borne without revenge becomes, or seems for the moment to become,\na thing beautiful and glorious. But more plays are constructed like the\n_Medea_. The _Hecuba_ begins with a noble and injured Queen, and ends\nwith her hideous vengeance on her enemy and his innocent sons. In the\n_Orestes_ all our hearts go out to the suffering and deserted prince,\ntill we find at last that we have committed ourselves to the\nblood-thirst of a madman. In the _Electra_, the workers of the vengeance\nthemselves repent.\n\nThe dramatic effect of this kind of tragedy is curious. No one can call\nit undramatic or tame. Yet it is painfully unsatisfying. At the close of\nthe _Medea_ I actually find myself longing for a _deus ex machin\u00c3\u00a2_, for\nsome being like Artemis in the _Hippolytus_ or the good Dioscuri of the\n_Electra_, to speak a word of explanation or forgiveness, or at least\nleave some sound of music in our ears to drown that dreadful and\ninsistent clamour of hate. The truth is that in this play Medea herself\nis the _dea ex machin\u00c3\u00a2_. The woman whom Jason and Creon intended simply\nto crush has been transformed by her injuries from an individual human\nbeing into a sort of living Curse. She is inspired with superhuman\nforce. Her wrongs and her hate fill all the sky. And the judgment\npronounced on Jason comes not from any disinterested or peace-making\nGod, but from his own victim transfigured into a devil.\n\nFrom any such judgment there is an instant appeal to sane human\nsympathy. Jason has suffered more than enough. But that also is the way\nof the world. And the last word upon these tragic things is most often\nsomething not to be expressed by the sentences of even the wisest\narticulate judge, but only by the unspoken _lacrim\u00c3\u00a6 rerum_.\n\n                                                              G.

He, even he,\nWhom to know well was all the world to me,\nThe man I loved, hath proved most evil.--Oh,\nOf all things upon earth that bleed and grow,\nA herb most bruised is woman. We must pay\nOur store of gold, hoarded for that one day,\nTo buy us some man's love; and lo, they bring\nA master of our flesh! There comes the sting\nOf the whole shame.

Myself, uncounsell\u00c3\u00a8d,\nStole forth from father and from home, and fled\nWhere dark I\u00c3\u00b4lcos under Pelion lies,\nWith thee--Oh, single-hearted more than wise!\nI murdered Pelias, yea, in agony,\nBy his own daughters' hands, for sake of thee;\nI swept their house like War.--And hast thou then\nAccepted all--O evil yet again!--\nAnd cast me off and taken thee for bride\nAnother? And with children at thy side!\nOne could forgive a childless man. But no:\nI have borne thee children . . .\n                           Is sworn faith so low\nAnd weak a thing? I understand it not.\nAre the old gods dead? Are the old laws forgot,\nAnd new laws made? Since not my passioning,\nBut thine own heart, doth cry thee for a thing\nForsworn.\n\n                   [_She catches sight of her own hand which\n                        she has thrown out to denounce him._\n\n            Poor, poor right hand of mine, whom he\nDid cling to, and these knees, so cravingly,\nWe are unclean, thou and I; we have caught the stain\nOf bad men's flesh . . . and dreamed our dreams in vain.\n  Thou comest to befriend me? Give me, then,\nThy counsel. 'Tis not that I dream again\nFor good from thee: but, questioned, thou wilt show\nThe viler. Say: now whither shall I go?\nBack to my father? Him I did betray,\nAnd all his land, when we two fled away.\nTo those poor Peliad maids? For them 'twere good\nTo take me in, who spilled their father's blood. . . .\nAye, so my whole life stands! There were at home\nWho loved me well: to them I am become\nA curse. And the first friends who sheltered me,\nWhom most I should have spared, to pleasure thee\nI have turned to foes. Oh, therefore hast thou laid\nMy crown upon me, blest of many a maid\nIn Hellas, now I have won what all did crave,\nThee, the world-wondered lover and the brave;\nWho this day looks and sees me banished, thrown\nAway with these two babes, all, all, alone . . .\nOh, merry mocking when the lamps are red:\n\"Where go the bridegroom's babes to beg their bread\nIn exile, and the woman who gave all\nTo save him?\"\n               O great God, shall gold withal\nBear thy clear mark, to sift the base and fine,\nAnd o'er man's living visage runs no sign\nTo show the lie within, ere all too late?\n\n                 LEADER.\n\nDire and beyond all healing is the hate\nWhen hearts that loved are turned to enmity.\n\n                 JASON.\n\nIn speech at least, meseemeth, I must be\nNot evil; but, as some old pilot goes\nFurled to his sail's last edge, when danger blows\nToo fiery, run before the wind and swell,\nWoman, of thy loud storms.--And thus I tell\nMy tale. Since thou wilt build so wondrous high\nThy deeds of service in my jeopardy,\nTo all my crew and quest I know but one\nSaviour, of Gods or mortals one alone,\nThe Cyprian. Oh, thou hast both brain and wit,\nYet underneath . . . nay, all the tale of it\nWere graceless telling; how sheer love, a fire\nOf poison-shafts, compelled thee with desire\nTo save me. But enough. I will not score\nThat count too close. 'Twas good help: and therefor\nI give thee thanks, howe'er the help was wrought.\nHowbeit, in my deliverance, thou hast got\nFar more than given. A good Greek land hath been\nThy lasting home, not barbary. Thou hast seen\nOur ordered life, and justice, and the long\nStill grasp of law not changing with the strong\nMan's pleasure. Then, all Hellas far and near\nHath learned thy wisdom, and in every ear\nThy fame is. Had thy days run by unseen\nOn that last edge of the world, where then had been\nThe story of great Medea? Thou and I . . .\nWhat worth to us were treasures heap\u00c3\u00a8d high\nIn rich kings' rooms; what worth a voice of gold\nMore sweet than ever rang from Orpheus old,\nUnless our deeds have glory?\n                               Speak I so,\nTouching the Quest I wrought, thyself did throw\nThe challenge down. Next for thy cavilling\nOf wrath at mine alliance with a king,\nHere thou shalt see I both was wise, and free\nFrom touch of passion, and a friend to thee\nMost potent, and my children . . . Nay, be still!\n  When first I stood in Corinth, clogged with ill\nFrom many a desperate mischance, what bliss\nCould I that day have dreamed of, like to this,\nTo wed with a king's daughter, I exiled\nAnd beggared? Not--what makes thy passion wild--\nFrom loathing of thy bed; not over-fraught\nWith love for this new bride; not that I sought\nTo upbuild mine house with offspring: 'tis enough,\nWhat thou hast borne: I make no word thereof:\nBut, first and greatest, that we all might dwell\nIn a fair house and want not, knowing well\nThat poor men have no friends, but far and near\nShunning and silence. Next, I sought to rear\nOur sons in nurture worthy of my race,\nAnd, raising brethren to them, in one place\nJoin both my houses, and be all from now\nPrince-like and happy. What more need hast thou\nOf children? And for me, it serves my star\nTo link in strength the children that now are\nWith those that shall be.\n                          Have I counselled ill?\nNot thine own self would say it, couldst thou still\nOne hour thy jealous flesh.--'Tis ever so!\nWho looks for more in women? When the flow\nOf love runs plain, why, all the world is fair:\nBut, once there fall some ill chance anywhere\nTo baulk that thirst, down in swift hate are trod\nMen's dearest aims and noblest. Would to God\nWe mortals by some other seed could raise\nOur fruits, and no blind women block our ways!\nThen had there been no curse to wreck mankind.\n\n                 LEADER.\n\nLord Jason, very subtly hast thou twined\nThy speech: but yet, though all athwart thy will\nI speak, this is not well thou dost, but ill,\nBetraying her who loved thee and was true.\n\n                 MEDEA.\n\nSurely I have my thoughts, and not a few\nHave held me strange. To me it seemeth, when\nA crafty tongue is given to evil men\n'Tis like to wreck, not help them. Their own brain\nTempts them with lies to dare and dare again,\nTill . . . no man hath enough of subtlety.\nAs thou--be not so seeming-fair to me\nNor deft of speech. One word will make thee fall.\nWert thou not false, 'twas thine to tell me all,\nAnd charge me help thy marriage path, as I\nDid love thee; not befool me with a lie.\n\n                 JASON.\n\nAn easy task had that been! Aye, and thou\nA loving aid, who canst not, even now,\nStill that loud heart that surges like the tide!\n\n                 MEDEA.\n\nThat moved thee not. Thine old barbarian bride,\nThe dog out of the east who loved thee sore,\nShe grew grey-haired, she served thy pride no more.\n\n                 JASON.\n\nNow understand for once! The girl to me\nIs nothing, in this web of sovranty\nI hold. I do but seek to save, even yet,\nThee: and for brethren to our sons beget\nYoung kings, to prosper all our lives again.\n\n                 MEDEA.\n\nGod shelter me from prosperous days of pain,\nAnd wealth that maketh wounds about my heart.\n\n                 JASON.\n\nWilt change that prayer, and choose a wiser part?\nPray not to hold true sense for pain, nor rate\nThyself unhappy, being too fortunate.\n\n                 MEDEA.\n\nAye, mock me; thou hast where to lay thine head,\nBut I go naked to mine exile.\n\n                 JASON.\n\n                             Tread\nThine own path! Thou hast made it all to be.\n\n                 MEDEA.\n\nHow? By seducing and forsaking thee?\n\n                 JASON.\n\nBy those vile curses on the royal halls\nLet loose. . . .\n\n                 MEDEA.\n\n                    On thy house also, as chance falls,\nI am a living curse.\n\n                 JASON.\n\n                      Oh, peace! Enough\nOf these vain wars: I will no more thereof.\nIf thou wilt take from all that I possess\nAid for these babes and thine own helplessness\nOf exile, speak thy bidding. Here I stand\nFull-willed to succour thee with stintless hand,\nAnd send my signet to old friends that dwell\nOn foreign shores, who will entreat thee well.\nRefuse, and thou shalt do a deed most vain.\nBut cast thy rage away, and thou shalt gain\nMuch, and lose little for thine anger's sake.\n\n                 MEDEA.\n\nI will not seek thy friends. I will not take\nThy givings. Give them not. Fruits of a stem\nUnholy bring no blessing after them.\n\n                 JASON.\n\nNow God in heaven be witness, all my heart\nIs willing, in all ways, to do its part\nFor thee and for thy babes. But nothing good\nCan please thee. In sheer savageness of mood\nThou drivest from thee every friend. Wherefore\nI warrant thee, thy pains shall be the more.\n\n                                     [_He goes slowly away._\n\n                 MEDEA.\n\nGo: thou art weary for the new delight\nThou wooest, so long tarrying out of sight\nOf her sweet chamber.

Yet will I make one prayer,\nThat my two children be no more exiled\nBut stay. . . . Oh, not that I would leave a child\nHere upon angry shores till those have laughed\nWho hate me: 'tis that I will slay by craft\nThe king's daughter. With gifts they shall be sent,\nGifts to the bride to spare their banishment,\nFine robings and a carcanet of gold.\nWhich raiment let her once but take, and fold\nAbout her, a foul death that girl shall die\nAnd all who touch her in her agony.\nSuch poison shall they drink, my robe and wreath!\n  Howbeit, of that no more. I gnash my teeth\nThinking on what a path my feet must tread\nThereafter. I shall lay those children dead--\nMine, whom no hand shall steal from me away!\nThen, leaving Jason childless, and the day\nAs night above him, I will go my road\nTo exile, flying, flying from the blood\nOf these my best-beloved, and having wrought\nAll horror, so but one thing reach me not,\nThe laugh of them that hate us.\n                                   Let it come!\nWhat profits life to me?

And accept these robes they bear\nAs gifts: and beg thy father to unmake\nHis doom of exile on them--for my sake.\"\nWhen once she saw the raiment, she could still\nHer joy no more, but gave him all his will.\nAnd almost ere the father and the two\nChildren were gone from out the room, she drew\nThe flower\u00c3\u00a8d garments forth, and sate her down\nTo her arraying: bound the golden crown\nThrough her long curls, and in a mirror fair\nArranged their separate clusters, smiling there\nAt the dead self that faced her. Then aside\nShe pushed her seat, and paced those chambers wide\nAlone, her white foot poising delicately--\nSo passing joyful in those gifts was she!--\nAnd many a time would pause, straight-limbed, and wheel\nHer head to watch the long fold to her heel\nSweeping. And then came something strange. Her cheek\nSeemed pale, and back with crooked steps and weak\nGroping of arms she walked, and scarcely found\nHer old seat, that she fell not to the ground.\n  Among the handmaids was a woman old\nAnd grey, who deemed, I think, that Pan had hold\nUpon her, or some spirit, and raised a keen\nAwakening shout; till through her lips was seen\nA white foam crawling, and her eyeballs back\nTwisted, and all her face dead pale for lack\nOf life: and while that old dame called, the cry\nTurned strangely to its opposite, to die\nSobbing. Oh, swiftly then one woman flew\nTo seek her father's rooms, one for the new\nBridegroom, to tell the tale. And all the place\nWas loud with hurrying feet.\n                            So long a space\nAs a swift walker on a measured way\nWould pace a furlong's course in, there she lay\nSpeechless, with veil\u00c3\u00a8d lids. Then wide her eyes\nShe oped, and wildly, as she strove to rise,\nShrieked: for two diverse waves upon her rolled\nOf stabbing death. The carcanet of gold\nThat gripped her brow was molten in a dire\nAnd wondrous river of devouring fire.\nAnd those fine robes, the gift thy children gave--\nGod's mercy!--everywhere did lap and lave\nThe delicate flesh; till up she sprang, and fled,\nA fiery pillar, shaking locks and head\nThis way and that, seeking to cast the crown\nSomewhere away. But like a thing nailed down\nThe burning gold held fast the anadem,\nAnd through her locks, the more she scattered them,\nCame fire the fiercer, till to earth she fell\nA thing--save to her sire--scarce nameable,\nAnd strove no more. That cheek of royal mien,\nWhere was it--or the place where eyes had been?\nOnly from crown and temples came faint blood\nShot through with fire. The very flesh, it stood\nOut from the bones, as from a wounded pine\nThe gum starts, where those gnawing poisons fine\nBit in the dark--a ghastly sight! And touch\nThe dead we durst not. We had seen too much.\n  But that poor father, knowing not, had sped,\nSwift to his daughter's room, and there the dead\nLay at his feet. He knelt, and groaning low,\nFolded her in his arms, and kissed her: \"Oh,\nUnhappy child, what thing unnatural hath\nSo hideously undone thee? Or what wrath\nOf gods, to make this old grey sepulchre\nChildless of thee? Would God but lay me there\nTo die with thee, my daughter!\" So he cried.\nBut after, when he stayed from tears, and tried\nTo uplift his old bent frame, lo, in the folds\nOf those fine robes it held, as ivy holds\nStrangling among your laurel boughs. Oh, then\nA ghastly struggle came! Again, again,\nUp on his knee he writhed; but that dead breast\nClung still to his: till, wild, like one possessed,\nHe dragged himself half free; and, lo, the live\nFlesh parted; and he laid him down to strive\nNo more with death, but perish; for the deep\nHad risen above his soul. And there they sleep,\nAt last, the old proud father and the bride,\nEven as his tears had craved it, side by side.\n  For thee--Oh, no word more! Thyself will know\nHow best to baffle vengeance. . . . Long ago\nI looked upon man's days, and found a grey\nShadow. And this thing more I surely say,\nThat those of all men who are counted wise,\nStrong wits, devisers of great policies,\nDo pay the bitterest toll. Since life began,\nHath there in God's eye stood one happy man?\nFair days roll on, and bear more gifts or less\nOf fortune, but to no man happiness.\n\n                                          [_Exit_ MESSENGER.\n\n                 CHORUS.\n\n              _Some Women._\n\nWrath upon wrath, meseems, this day shall fall\nFrom God on Jason!

They\nstood above the north end of the Bosphorus and formed the Gate (l. 1264,\np. 70) to the Axeinos Pontos, or \"Stranger-less Sea,\" where all Greeks\nwere murdered. At the farthest eastern end of that sea was the land of\nColchis.\n\nP. 3, l. 3, P\u00c3\u00aalion.]--The great mountain in Thessaly. I\u00c3\u00b4lcos, a little\nkingdom between P\u00c3\u00aalion and the sea, ruled originally by Aeson, Jason's\nfather, then by the usurping Pelias.\n\nP. 3, l. 9, Daughters of Pelias.]--See Introduction, p. vii.\n\nP. 4, l. 18, Wed.]--Medea was not legally married to Jason, and could\nnot be, though in common parlance he is sometimes called her husband.\nIntermarriage between the subjects of two separate states was not\npossible in antiquity without a special treaty. And naturally there was\nno such treaty with Colchis.\n\nThis is, I think, the view of the play, and corresponds to the normal\nAthenian conceptions of society. In the original legend it is likely\nenough that Medea belongs to \"matriarchal\" times before the institution\nof marriage.\n\nP. 4, l. 18, Head of Corinth.]--A peculiar word ([Greek: aisumnan])\nafterwards used to translate the Roman _dictator_. Creon is, however,\napparently descended from the ancient king Sisyphus.\n\nP. 4, l. 40, She hath a blade made keen, &c.]--These lines (40, 41) are\nrepeated in a different context later on, p. 23, ll. 379, 380. The sword\nwhich to the Nurse suggested suicide was really meant for murder. There\nis a similar and equally dramatic repetition of the lines about the\ncrown and wreath (786, 949, pp. 46, 54), and of those about the various\ncharacters popularly attributed to Medea (ll. 304, 808, pp. 18, 46).\n\nP. 5, l. 48, ATTENDANT.]--Greek _Paidag\u00c3\u00b4gos_, or \"pedagogue\"; a\nconfidential servant who escorted the boys to and from school, and in\nsimilar ways looked after them. Notice the rather light and cynical\ncharacter of this man, compared with the tenderness of the Nurse.\n\nP. 5, l. 57, To this still earth and sky.]--Not a mere stage\nexplanation. It was the ancient practice, if you had bad dreams or\nterrors of the night, to \"show\" them to the Sun in the morning, that he\nmight clear them away.\n\nP. 8, l. 111, Have I not suffered?]--Medea is apparently answering some\nwould-be comforter. Cf. p. 4. (\"If friends will speak,\" &c.)\n\nP. 9, l. 131, CHORUS.]--As Dr. Verrall has remarked, the presence of the\nChorus is in this play unusually awkward from the dramatic point of\nview. Medea's plot demands most absolute secrecy; and it is incredible\nthat fifteen Corinthian women, simply because they were women, should\nallow a half-mad foreigner to murder several people, including their\nown Corinthian king and princess--who was a woman also--rather than\nreveal her plot. We must remember in palliation (1) that these women\nbelong to the faction in Corinth which was friendly to Medea and hostile\nto Creon; (2) that the appeal to them as women had more force in\nantiquity than it would now, and the princess had really turned traitor\nto her sex. (See note on this subject at the end of the present writer's\ntranslation of the _Electra_.) (3) The non-interference of the Chorus\nseems monstrous: yet in ancient times, when law was weak and punishment\nwas chiefly the concern of the injured persons, and of no one else, the\nreluctance of bystanders to interfere was much greater than it is now in\nan ordered society. Some oriental countries, and perhaps even California\nor Texas, could afford us some startling instances of impassiveness\namong bystanders.\n\nP. 12, l. 167, Oh, wild words!]--The Nurse breaks in, hoping to drown\nher mistress's dangerous self-betrayal. Medea's murder of her brother\n(see Introduction, p. vi) was by ordinary standards her worst act, and\nseems not to have been known in Corinth. It forms the climax of Jason's\ndenunciation, l. 1334, p. 74.\n\nP. 13, l. 190, Alas, the brave blithe bards, &c.]--Who is the speaker?\nAccording to the MSS. the Nurse, and there is some difficulty in taking\nthe lines from her. Yet (1) she has no reason to sing a song outside\nafter saying that she is going in; and (2) it is quite necessary that\nshe should take a little time indoors persuading Medea to come out. The\nwords seem to suit the lips of an impersonal Chorus.\n\nThe general sense of the poem is interesting. It is an apology for\ntragedy. It gives the tragic poet's conception of the place of his art\nin the service of humanity, as against the usual feeling of the public,\nwhose serious work is devoted to something else, and who \"go to a play\nto be amused.\"\n\nP. 14, l. 214, Women of Corinth, I am come, &c.]--These opening lines\nare a well-known _crux interpretum_. It is interesting to note, (1) that\nthe Roman poet Ennius (ca. 200 B.C.) who translated the _Medea_, did not\nunderstand them in the least; while, on the other hand, the earliest\nGreek commentators seem not to have noticed that there was any\ndifficulty in them worth commenting upon. That implies that while the\nacting tradition was alive and unbroken, the lines were easily\nunderstood; but when once the tradition failed, the meaning was lost.\n(The first commentator who deals with the passage is Irenaeus, a scholar\nof the Augustan time.)\n\nP. 15, l. 231, A herb most bruised is woman.]--This fine statement of\nthe wrongs of women in Athens doubtless contains a great deal of the\npoet's own mind; but from the dramatic point of view it is justified in\nseveral ways. (1) Medea is seeking for a common ground on which to\nappeal to the Corinthian women. (2) She herself is now in the position\nof all others in which a woman is most hardly treated as compared with a\nman. (3) Besides this, one can see that, being a person of great powers\nand vehement will, she feels keenly her lack of outlet. If she had men's\nwork to do, she could be a hero: debarred from proper action (from\n[Greek: to prassein], _Hip._ 1019) she is bound to make mischief. Cf. p.\n24, ll. 408, 409. \"Things most vain, &c.\"\n\nThere is a slight anachronism in applying the Attic system of doweries\nto primitive times. Medea's contemporaries either lived in a\n\"matriarchal\" system without any marriage, or else were bought by their\nhusbands for so many cows.\n\nP. 17, l. 271, CREON.]--Observe the somewhat archaic abruptness of this\nscene, a sign of the early date of the play.\n\nP. 18, l. 295, Wise beyond men's wont.]--Medea was a \"wise woman\" which\nin her time meant much the same as a witch or enchantress. She did\nreally know more than other women; but most of this extra knowledge\nconsisted--or was supposed to consist--either in lore of poisons and\ncharms, or in useless learning and speculation.\n\nP. 18, l. 304, A seed of strife, an Eastern dreamer, &c.]--The meaning\nof these various \"ill names\" is not certain. Cf. l. 808, p. 46. Most\nscholars take [Greek: thaterou tropou] (\"of the other sort\") to mean\n\"the opposite of a dreamer.\"\n\nP. 20, ll. 333-4, What would I with thy pains?]--A conceit almost in the\nElizabethan style, as if by taking \"pains\" away from Creon, she would\nhave them herself.\n\nP. 20, l. 335, Not that! Not that!]--Observe what a dislike Medea has of\nbeing touched: cf. l. 370 (\"my flesh been never stained,\" &c.) and l.\n496 (\"poor, poor right hand of mine!\"), pp. 22, and 28.\n\nP. 22, l. 364, Defeat on every side.]--Observe (1) that in this speech\nMedea's vengeance is to take the form of a clear fight to the death\nagainst the three guilty persons. It is both courageous and, judged by\nthe appropriate standard, just. (2) She wants to save her own life, not\nfrom cowardice, but simply to make her revenge more complete. To kill\nher enemies and escape is victory. To kill them and die with them is\nonly a drawn battle. Other enemies will live and \"laugh.\" (3) Already in\nthis first soliloquy there is a suggestion of that strain of madness\nwhich becomes unmistakable later on in the play. (\"Oh, I have tried so\nmany thoughts of murder,\" &c., and especially the lashing of her own\nfury, \"Awake thee now, Medea.\")\n\nP. 24, l. 405, Thief's daughter: lit. \"a child of Sisyphus.\"]--Sisyphus,\nan ancient king of Corinth, was one of the well-known sinners punished\nin Tartarus. Medea's father, Ai\u00c3\u00aat\u00c3\u00aas, was a brother of Circe, and born of\nthe Sun.\n\nP. 24, l. 409, Things most vain for help.]--See on ll. 230 ff.\n\nP. 24. ll. 410-430, CHORUS.]--The song celebrates the coming triumph of\nWoman in her rebellion against Man; not by any means Woman as typifying\nthe domestic virtues, but rather as the downtrodden, uncivilised,\nunreasoning, and fiercely emotional half of humanity. A woman who in\ndefence of her honour and her rights will die sword in hand, slaying the\nman who wronged her, seems to the Chorus like a deliverer of the whole\nsex.\n\nP. 24. l. 421, Old bards.]--Early literature in most countries contains\na good deal of heavy satire on women: _e.g._ Hesiod's \"Who trusts a\nwoman trusts a thief;\" or Phocylides' \"Two days of a woman are very\nsweet: when you marry her and when you carry her to her grave.\"\n\nIt is curious how the four main Choruses of the _Medea_ are divided\neach into two parts, distinct in subject and in metre.\n\nP. 25, l. 439, Faith is no more sweet.]--Copied from a beautiful passage\nin Hesiod, _Works and Days_, 198 ff.: \"There shall be no more sweetness\nfound in the faithful man nor the righteous. . . . And at last up to\nOlympus from the wide-wayed earth, shrouding with white raiment their\nbeautiful faces, go Ruth and Rebuking.\" (Aidos and Nemesis: _i.e._ the\nRuth or Shame that you feel with reference to your own actions, and the\nIndignation or Disapproval that others feel.)\n\nP. 27, ll. 478 ff., Bulls of fiery breath.]--Among the tasks set him by\nAi\u00c3\u00aat\u00c3\u00aas, Jason had to yoke two fire-breathing bulls, and plough with them\na certain Field of Ares, sow the field with dragon's teeth, and reap a\nharvest of earth-born or giant warriors which sprang from the seed. When\nall this was done, there remained the ancient serpent coiled round the\ntree where the Golden Fleece was hanging.\n\nP. 29, l. 507, The first friends who sheltered me.]--_i.e._ the kindred\nof Pelias.\n\nP. 29, l. 509, Blest of many a maid in Hellas.]--Jason was, of course,\nthe great romantic hero of his time. Cf. his own words, l. 1340, p. 74.\n\nPp. 29 ff., ll. 523-575.--Jason's defence is made the weaker by his\nreluctance to be definitely insulting to Medea. He dares not say: \"You\nthink that, because you conceived a violent passion for me,--to which, I\nadmit, I partly responded--I must live with you always; but the truth\nis, you are a savage with whom a civilised man cannot go on living.\"\nThis point comes out unveiled in his later speech, l. 1329, ff., p. 74.\n\nP. 30, ll. 536 ff., Our ordered life and justice.]--Jason has brought\nthe benefits of civilisation to Medea! He is doubtless sincere, but the\npeculiar ironic cruelty of the plea is obvious.\n\nP. 30, ll. 541 ff., The story of Great Medea, &c. . . . Unless our deeds\nhave glory.]--This, I think, is absolutely sincere. To Jason ambition is\neverything. And, as Medea has largely shared his great deeds with him,\nhe thinks that she cannot but feel the same. It seems to him\ncontemptible that her mere craving for personal love should outweigh all\nthe possible glories of life.\n\nP. 31, l. 565, What more need hast thou of children?]--He only means,\n\"of more children than you now have.\" But the words suggest to Medea a\ndifferent meaning, and sow in her mind the first seed of the\nchild-murder. See on the Aegeus scene below.\n\nP. 34, l. 608, A living curse.]--Though she spoke no word, the existence\nof a being so deeply wronged would be a curse on her oppressors. So a\nmurdered man's blood, or an involuntary cry of pain (Aesch. _Ag._ 237)\non the part of an injured person is in itself fraught with a curse.\n\nP. 35. ll. 627-641, CHORUS. Alas, the Love, &c.]--A highly\ncharacteristic Euripidean poem, keenly observant of fact, yet with a\nlyrical note penetrating all its realism. A love which really produces\n\"good to man and glory,\" is treated in the next chorus, l. 844 ff., p.\n49.\n\nPp. 37 ff., ll. 663-759, AEGEUS.]--This scene is generally considered\nto be a mere blot on the play, not, I think, justly. It is argued that\nthe obvious purpose which the scene serves, the provision of an asylum\nfor Medea, has no keen dramatic interest. The spectator would just as\nsoon, or sooner, have her die. And, besides, her actual mode of escape\nis largely independent of Aegeus. Further, the arrival of Aegeus at this\nmoment seems to be a mere coincidence (_Ar. Poetics_, 61 b, 23), and one\ncannot help suspecting that the Athenian poet was influenced by mere\nlocal interests in dragging in the Athenian king and the praises of\nAthens where they were not specially appropriate.\n\nTo these criticisms one may make some answer. (1) As to the coincidence,\nit is important to remember always that Greek tragedies are primarily\nhistorical plays, not works of fiction. They are based on definite\n_Logoi_ or traditions (_Frogs_, l. 1052. p. 254) and therefore can, and\nshould, represent accidental coincidences when it was a datum of the\ntradition that these coincidences actually happened. By Aristotle's time\nthe practice had changed. The tragedies of his age were essentially\nfiction; and he tends to criticise the ancient tragedies by fictional\nstandards.\n\nNow it was certainly a datum in the Medea legend that she took refuge\nwith Aegeus, King of Athens, and was afterwards an enemy to his son\nTheseus; but I think we may go further. This play pretty certainly has\nfor its foundation the rites performed by the Corinthians at the Grave\nof the Children of Medea in the precinct of Hera Acraia near Corinth.\nSee on l. 1379. p. 77. The legend in such cases is usually invented to\nexplain the ritual; and I suspect that in the ritual, and,\nconsequently, in the legend, there were two other data: first, a pursuit\nof Medea and her flight on a dragon-chariot, and, secondly, a meeting\nbetween Medea and Aegeus. (Both subjects are frequent on vase paintings,\nand may well be derived from historical pictures in some temple at\nCorinth.)\n\nThus, the meeting with Aegeus is probably not the free invention of\nEuripides, but one of the data supplied to him by his subject. But he\nhas made it serve, as von Arnim was the first to perceive, a remarkable\ndramatic purpose. Aegeus was under a curse of childlessness, and his\ndesolate condition suggests to Medea the ultimate form of her vengeance.\nShe will make Jason childless. Cf. l. 670, \"Children! Ah God, art\nchildless?\" (A childless king in antiquity was a miserable object:\nlikely to be deposed and dishonoured, and to miss his due worship after\ndeath. See the fragments of Euripides' _Oineus_.)\n\nThere is also a further purpose in the scene, of a curious and\ncharacteristic kind. In several plays of Euripides, when a heroine\nhesitates on the verge of a crime, the thing that drives her over the\nbrink is some sudden and violent lowering of her self-respect. Thus\nPh\u00c3\u00a6dra writes her false letter immediately after her public shame.\nCre\u00c3\u00bbsa in the _Ion_ turns murderous only after crying in the god's ears\nthe story of her seduction. Medea, a princess and, as we have seen, a\nwoman of rather proud chastity, feels, after the offer which she makes\nto Aegeus in this scene (l. 716 ff., p. 42). that she need shrink from\nnothing.\n\nP. 38, l. 681, The hearth-stone of my sires of yore.]--This sounds\nas if it meant Aegeus' own house: in reality, by an oracular riddle, it\nmeant the house of Pittheus, by whose daughter, Aethra, Aegeus became\nthe father of Theseus.\n\nP. 43, l. 731, An oath wherein to trust.]--Observe that Medea is\ndeceiving Aegeus. She intends to commit a murder before going to him,\nand therefore wishes to bind him down so firmly that, however much he\nwish to repudiate her, he shall be unable. Hence this insistence on the\noath and the exact form of the oath. (At this time, apparently, she\nscarcely thinks of the children, only of her revenge.)\n\nP. 46, l. 808, No eastern dreamer, &c.]--See on l. 304.\n\nP. 47. l. 820, _The_ NURSE _comes out_.]--There is no indication in the\noriginal to show who comes out. But it is certainly a woman; as\ncertainly it is not one of the Chorus; and Medea's words suit the Nurse\nwell. It is an almost devilish act to send the Nurse, who would have\ndied rather than take such a message had she understood it.\n\nP. 48, ll. 824--846, The sons of Erechtheus, &c.]--This poem is\ninteresting as showing the ideal conception of Athens entertained by a\nfifth century Athenian. One might compare with it Pericles' famous\nspeech in Thucydides, ii., where the emphasis is laid on Athenian \"plain\nliving and high thinking\" and the freedom of daily life. Or, again, the\nspeeches of Aethra in Euripides' _Suppliant Women_, where more stress is\nlaid on mercy and championship of the oppressed.\n\nThe allegory of \"Harmony,\" as a sort of Kor\u00c3\u00aa, or Earth-maiden, planted\nby all the Muses in the soil of Attica, seems to be an invention of the\npoet. Not any given Art or Muse, but a spirit which unites and\nharmonises all, is the special spirit of Athens. The Attic connection\nwith Er\u00c3\u00b4s, on the other hand, is old and traditional. But Euripides has\ntransformed the primitive nature-god into a mystic and passionate\nlonging for \"all manner of high deed,\" a Love which, different from that\ndescribed in the preceding chorus, really ennobles human life.\n\nThis first part of the Chorus is, of course, suggested by Aegeus; the\nsecond is more closely connected with the action of the play. \"How can\nMedea dream of asking that stainless land to shelter her crimes? But the\nwhole plan of her revenge is not only wicked but impossible. She simply\ncould not do such a thing, if she tried.\"\n\nPp. 50 ff., l. 869, The second scene with Jason.]--Dic\u00c3\u00a6archus, and\nperhaps his master Aristotle also, seems to have complained of Medea's\nbursting into tears in this scene, instead of acting her part\nconsistently--a very prejudiced criticism. What strikes one about\nMedea's assumed r\u00c3\u00b4le is that in it she remains so like herself and so\nunlike another woman. Had she really determined to yield to Jason, she\nwould have done so in just this way, keen-sighted and yet passionate.\nOne is reminded of the deceits of half-insane persons, which are due not\nso much to conscious art as to the emergence of another side of the\npersonality.\n\nP. 54, l. 949, Fine robings, &c.]--Repeated from l. 786, p. 46, where it\ncame full in the midst of Medea's avowal of her murderous purpose. It\nstartles one here, almost as though she had spoken out the word \"murder\"\nin some way which Jason could not understand.\n\nP. 56, l. 976, CHORUS.]--The inaction of the Chorus women during the\nlast scene will not bear thinking about, if we regard them as real human\nbeings, like, for instance, the Bacch\u00c3\u00a6 and the Trojan Women in the plays\nthat bear their name. Still there is not only beauty, but, I think,\ngreat dramatic value in the conventional and almost mystical quality of\nthis Chorus, and also in the low and quiet tone of that which follows,\nl. 1081 ff.\n\nP. 59, ll. 1021 ff., Why does Medea kill her children?]--She acts not\nfor one clearly stated reason, like a heroine in Sardou, but for many\nreasons, both conscious and subconscious, as people do in real life. Any\nanalysis professing to be exact would be misleading, but one may note\nsome elements in her feeling: (1) She had played dangerously long with\nthe notion of making Jason childless. (2) When she repented of this (l.\n1046, p. 60) the children had already been made the unconscious\nmurderers of the princess. They were certain to be slain, perhaps with\ntortures, by the royal kindred. (3) Medea might take them with her to\nAthens and trust to the hope of Aegeus' being able and willing to\nprotect them. But it was a doubtful chance, and she would certainly be\nin a position of weakness and inferiority if she had the children to\nprotect. (4) In the midst of her passionate half-animal love for the\nchildren, there was also an element of hatred, because they were\nJason's: cf. l. 112, p. 8. (5) She also seems to feel, in a sort of\nwild-beast way, that by killing them she makes them more her own: cf. l.\n793, p. 46, \"Mine, whom no hand shall steal from me away;\" l. 1241, p,\n68, \"touched of none beside.\" (6) Euripides had apparently observed how\ncommon it is, when a woman's mind is deranged by suffering, that her\nmadness takes the form of child-murder. The terrible lines in which\nMedea speaks to the \"Wrath\" within her, as if it were a separate being\n(l. 1056, p. 60), seem to bear out this view.\n\nP. 59. l. 1038, Other shapes of life.]--A mystical conception of death.\nCf. _Ion_, 1067, where almost exactly the same phrase is used.\n\nP. 61, l. 1078, I know to what bad deeds, &c.]--This expression of\ndouble consciousness was immensely famous in antiquity. It is quoted by\nLucian, Plutarch, Clement, Galen, Synesius, Hierocles, Arrian,\nSimpicius, besides being imitated, _e.g._ by Ovid: \"video meliora\nproboque, Deteriora sequor.\"\n\nP. 63, l. 1123 ff., MESSENGER.]--A pendant to the Attendant's entrance\nabove, l. 1002. The Attendant, bringing apparently good news, is\nreceived with a moan of despair, the Messenger of calamity with serene\nsatisfaction. Cf. the Messenger who announces the death of Pentheus in\nthe _Bacch\u00c3\u00a6_.\n\nP. 65, l. 1162, Dead self.]--The reflection in the glass, often regarded\nas ominous or uncanny in some way.\n\nP. 66, l. 1176, The cry turned strangely to its opposite.]--The\nnotion was that an evil spirit could be scared away by loud cheerful\nshouts--_ololug\u00c3\u00a6_. But while this old woman is making an _ololug\u00c3\u00aa_, she\nsees that the trouble is graver than she thought, and the cheerful cry\nturns into a wail.\n\nP. 68, l. 1236, Women, my mind is clear.]--With the silence in which\nMedea passes over the success of her vengeance compare Theseus' words,\n_Hip._, l. 1260, \"I laugh not, neither weep, at this fell doom.\"\n\nP. 69, l. 1249, Thou shalt weep hereafter.]--Cf. _Othello_, v. ii., \"Be\nthus when thou art dead, and I will kiss thee, And love thee after.\"\n\nP. 69, ll. 1251 ff.--This curious prayer to the Sun to \"save\"\nMedea--both from the crime of killing her children and the misfortune of\nbeing caught by her enemies--is apparently meant to prepare us for the\nscene of the Dragon Chariot. Notice the emphasis laid on the divine\norigin of Medea's race and her transformation to \"a voice of Hell.\"\n\nP. 71, ll. 1278 ff., Death of the children.]--The door is evidently\nbarred, since Jason has to use crowbars to open it in l. 1317. Cf. the\nend of Maeterlinck's _Mort de Tintagiles_.\n\nP. 71, l. 1281, A mother slew her babes in days of yore, &c.]--Ino, wife\nof Athamas, King of Thebes, nursed the infant Dionysus. For this Hera\npunished her with madness. She killed her two children, Learchus and\nMelicertes, and leaped into the sea. (There are various versions of the\nstory.)--Observe the technique: just as the strain is becoming\nintolerable, we are turned away from tragedy to pure poetry. See on\n_Hip._ 731.\n\nP. 74, l. 1320, This, that shall save me from mine enemies'\nrage.]--There is nothing in the words of the play to show what \"this\"\nis, but the Scholiast explains it as a chariot drawn by winged serpents,\nand the stage tradition seems to be clear on the subject. See note to\nthe Aegeus scene (p. 88).\n\nThis first appearance of Medea \"above, on the tower\" (Scholiast) seems\nto me highly effective. The result is to make Medea into something like\na _dea ex machin\u00c3\u00a2_, who prophesies and pronounces judgment. See\nIntroduction.\n\nP. 76, l. 1370, They are dead, they are dead!]--This wrangle, though\nrather like some scenes in Norse sagas, is strangely discordant for a\nGreek play. It seems as if Euripides had deliberately departed from his\nusual soft and reflective style of ending in order to express the\npeculiar note of discord which is produced by the so-called\n\"satisfaction\" of revenge. Medea's curious cry: \"Oh, thy voice! It hurts\nme sore!\" shows that the effect is intentional.\n\nP. 77, l. 1379, A still green sepulchre.]--There was a yearly festival\nin the precinct of Hera Acraia, near Corinth, celebrating the deaths of\nMedea's children. This festival, together with its ritual and \"sacred\nlegend,\" evidently forms the germ of the whole tragedy. Cf. the\nTrozenian rites over the tomb of Hippolytus, _Hip._ 1424 ff.\n\nP. 77, l. 1386, The hands of thine old Argo.]--Jason, left friendless\nand avoided by his kind, went back to live with his old ship, now\nrotting on the shore. While he was sleeping under it, a beam of wood\nfell upon him and broke his head. It is a most grave mistake to treat\nthe line as spurious.\n\n\n\n\n_BY THE SAME AUTHOR_\n\n\nHISTORY OF ANCIENT GREEK LITERATURE.\n\nANDROMACHE: A Play.\n\nCARLYON SAHIB: A Play.\n\nTHE EXPLOITATION OF INFERIOR RACES, IN ANCIENT AND MODERN TIMES:\n  An Essay in \"Liberalism and the Empire.\"\n\nEURIPIDIS FABULAE: Brevi Adnotatione Critica Instructae,\n  Vols.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":872,"split":"train"}
