The news is kept from him and his family so long as possible, and his death comes as a great shock. Sir Thomas was aware that Dr. Jemmy Fox has fallen in love with his daughter Inez, and expresses to his friend Rev. Philip Penniloe his approval of the match should the girl herself care for the doctor. On the very night of the squire\u00e2\u0080\u0099s funeral it is found that the grave has been rifled and the body stolen. The only man with a clue to the mystery is a blacksmith who has been called up late at night by a mysterious party with a cart. He declares, on first telling of this, that he saw Dr. Fox with the cart, and this makes people suspect that Dr. Fox performed the sacrilege for medical purposes.\nFox finds himself pointed at and shunned by nearly everybody in the parish of Perlycross. Lady Waldron, who never liked Fox, eagerly adopts the story. He has however, an alibi, as at the time of the occurrence he had been summoned to a distant place where his father was ill. Penniloe and others remain staunch to him, and one or two of the villagers take his side. Fox tries to see Lady Waldron, but she refuses him admittance; he, however, meets Inez, and not only finds that she does not believe the calumny, but that she reciprocates his affections. Time passes, and there is no clue found to the mystery; everybody is worried over it, especially, of course, Lady Waldron and her daughter, Dr. Fox, and Mr. Penniloe. The mystery is only resolved on the return of Sir Thomas's son from abroad, as he proves to be the means of finding the solution.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Perlycross, by R.

Philip Penniloe was Curate-in-charge of\nPerlycross, a village in a valley of the Blackdown Range. It was true\nthat the Rector, the Rev. John Chevithorne, M.A., came twice every year\nto attend to his tithes; but otherwise he never thought of interfering,\nand would rather keep his distance from spiritual things. Mr. Penniloe\nhad been his College-tutor, and still was his guide upon any points of\nduty less cardinal than discipline of dogs and horses.\n\nThe title of \"Curate-in-charge\" as yet was not invented generally; but\nfar more Curates held that position than hold it in these stricter\ntimes. And the shifting of Curates from parish to parish was not so\nfrequent as it is now; theological views having less range and rage, and\nCurates less divinity. Moreover it cost much more to move.\n\nBut the Curate of Perlycross was not of a lax or careless nature. He\nwould do what his conscience required, at the cost of his last penny;\nand he thought and acted as if this world were only the way to a better\none. In this respect he differed widely from all the people of his\nparish, as well as from most of his Clerical brethren. And it is no\nlittle thing to say of him, that he was beloved in spite of his piety.\n\nEspecially was he loved and valued by a man who had known him from\nearly days, and was now the Squire, and chief landowner, in the parish\nof Perlycross. Sir Thomas Waldron, of Walderscourt, had battled as\nbravely with the sword of steel, as the Churchman had with the spiritual\nweapon, receiving damages more substantial than the latter can inflict.\nAlthough by no means invalided, perhaps he had been pleased at first to\nfall into the easy lap of peace. After eight years of constant hardship,\nfrequent wounds, and famishing, he had struck his last blow at Waterloo,\nand then settled down in the English home, with its comforting cares,\nand mild delights.\n\nNow, in his fiftieth year, he seemed more likely to stand on the\nbattlements of life than many a lad of twenty. Straight and tall, robust\nand ruddy, clear of skin, and sound of foot, he was even cited by the\ndoctors of the time, as a proof of the benefit that flows from bleeding\nfreely. Few men living had shed more blood (from their own veins at any\nrate) for the good of their native land, and none had made less fuss\nabout it; so that his Country, with any sense of gratitude, must now put\nsubstance into him. Yet he was by no means over fat; simply in good\ncase, and form. In a word, you might search the whole county, and find\nno finer specimen of a man, and a gentleman too, than Colonel Sir Thomas\nWaldron.\n\nAll this Mr. Penniloe knew well; and having been a small boy, when the\nColonel was a big one, at the best school in the west of England, he\nowed him many a good turn for the times when the body rules the roost,\nand the mind is a little chick, that can't say--\"Cockadoodle.\" In those\nfine days, education was a truly rational process; creating a void in\nthe juvenile system by hunger, and filling it up with thumps. Scientific\nresearch has now satisfied itself that the mind and the body are the\nselfsame thing; but this was not understood as yet, and the one\nministered to the other. For example, the big Tom Waldron supplied the\nlittle Phil Penniloe with dumps and penny-puddings, and with fists ever\nready for his defence; while the quicker mind sat upon the broad arch of\nchest sprawling along the old oak bench, and construed the lessons for\nit, or supplied the sad hexameter. When such a pair meet again in later\nlife, sweet memories arise, and fine goodwill.\n\nThis veteran friendship even now was enduring a test too severe, in\ngeneral, for even the most sterling affection. But a conscientious man\nmust strive, when bound by Holy Orders, to make every member of his\nparish discharge his duty to the best advantage. And if there be a duty\nwhich our beloved Church--even in her snoring period--has endeavoured to\nimpress, the candid layman must confess that it is the duty of\nalms-giving. Here Mr. Penniloe was strong--far in advance of the times\nhe lived in, though still behind those we have the privilege to pay for.\nFor as yet it was the faith of the general parishioner, that he had a\nstrong parochial right to come to church for nothing; and if he chose to\nexercise it, thereby added largely to the welfare of the Parson, and\nearned a handsome reference. And as yet he could scarcely reconcile it\nwith his abstract views of religion, to find a plate poked into his\nwaistcoat pocket, not for increase, but depletion thereof.\n\nAcknowledging the soundness of these views, we may well infer that\nPerlycross was a parish in which a well-ordered Parson could do anything\nreasonable. More than one substantial farmer was good enough to be\npleased at first, and try to make his wife take it so, at these\nopportunities of grace. What that expression meant was more than he\ncould for the life of him make out; but he always connected it with\nsomething black, and people who stretched out their hands under\ncocoa-nuts bigger than their heads, while \"come over and help us,\"\nissued from their mouths. If a shilling was any good to them, bless\ntheir woolly heads, it only cost a quarter of a pound of wool!\n\nHappy farmer, able still to find a shilling in his Sunday small-clothes,\nand think of the guineas in a nest beneath the thatch! For wheat was\ngolden still in England, and the good ox owned his silver side. The fair\noutlook over hill and valley, rustling field and quiet meadow, was not\nyet a forlorn view, a sight that is cut short in sigh, a prospect\nnarrowing into a lane that plods downhill to workhouse. For as yet it\nwas no mockery to cast the fat grain among the clods, or trickle it into\nthe glistening drill, to clear the sleek blade from the noisome weed,\nto watch the soft waves of silky tassels dimple and darken to the breeze\nof June, and then the lush heads with their own weight bowing to the\nstillness of the August sun, thrilling the eyes with innumerable throng,\nglowing with impenetrable depth of gold. Alas, that this beauty should\nbe of the past, and ground into gritty foreign flour!\n\nBut in the current year of grace, these good sons of our native land had\nno dream of the treason, which should sell our homes and landscapes to\nthe sneering foreigner. Their trouble, though heavy, was not of British\nmadness, but inflicted from without; and therefore could be met and\ncured by men of strong purpose and generous act.\n\nThat grand old church of Perlycross (standing forth in gray power of\nlife, as against the black ruins of the Abbey) had suddenly been found\nwanting--wanting foundation, and broad buttress, solid wall, and\nsound-timbered roof, and even deeper hold on earth for the high soar of\nthe tower. This tower was famous among its friends, not only for\nsubstance, and height, and proportion, and piercings, and sweet content\nof bells; but also for its bold uplifting of the green against the blue.\nTo-wit, for a time much longer than any human memory, a sturdy yew-tree\nhad been standing on the topmost stringing-course, in a sheltering niche\nof the southern face, with its head over-topping the battlements, and\nscraping the scroll of the south-east vane. Backed as it was by solid\nstone, no storm had succeeded in tugging its tough roots out of the\nmeshes of mortar; and there it stood and meant to stand, a puzzle to\ngardeners, a pleasure to jackdaws, and the pride of all Perlycrucians.\nEven Mr. Penniloe, that great improver, could not get a penny towards\nhis grand designs, until he had signed a document with both\nChurchwardens, that happen what might, not a hair of the head of the\nsacred yew-tree should perish.\n\nMany a penny would be wanted now, and who was to provide them? The\nparish, though large and comprising some of the best land in East Devon,\nhad few resources of commerce, and not many of manufacture. The bright\nPerle running from east to west clove it in twain; and the northern\npart, which was by far the larger, belonged to the Waldrons; while the\nsouthern (including the church and greater part of village) was of\ndivers owners, the chiefest being the Dean and Chapter of Exeter. It is\nneedless to say that this sacred body never came nigh the place, and\nfelt no obligation towards it, at the manhood of this century.\n\n\"What is to be done?\" cried the only man who could enter into the grief\nof it, when Richard Horner of Pumpington, architect, land-agent, and\nsurveyor, appeared before the Clergyman and Churchwardens, with the\nreport required by them.\n\n\"One of two things,\" answered Mr. Horner, a man of authority and\nbrevity; \"either let it crumble, or make up your minds to spend a\nthousand pounds upon it.\"\n\n\"We should be prepared to spend that sum, if we had only got it;\" Mr.\nPenniloe said, with that gentle smile which made his people fond of him.\n\n\"We han't got a thousand, nor a hundred nayther You talk a bit too big,\nDick. You always did have a big mouth, you know.\"\n\nThe architect looked at his cousin, Farmer John (the senior Churchwarden\nof Perlycross, and chief tenant of the Capitular estates), and if his\nown mouth was large, so was that of his kinsman, as he addressed him\nthus.\n\n\"John Horner, we know well enough, what you be. It wouldn't make much of\na hole in you, to put down your hundred pounds--to begin with.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said his colleague, Frank Farrant, while the elder was in labour\nof amazement; \"if John will put down his hundred pounds, you may trust\nme to find fifty.\"\n\n\"And fifty to you is a good bit more than a thousand to him, I reckon.\nBook it, Mr. Penniloe, before they run back; and me for another five and\ntwenty.\"\n\n\"I never said it; I never said a word of it\"--Farmer John began to gasp,\nwhile cousin and colleague were patting him on the back, crying,\n\n\"Don't go back from your word, John.\"\n\n\"Now, did I say it, Parson Penniloe?\" he appealed, as soon as they would\nlet him speak; \"come now, I'll go by what you say of it.\"\n\n\"No, Mr. Horner; I wish you had. You never said anything of the kind.\"\n\n\"Parson, you are a gentleman. I do like a man as tells the truth. But\nas for them fellows, I'll just show them what's what. Whether I said it,\nor no--I'll do it.\"\n\nMr. Penniloe smiled, but not with pleasure only. Simple and charitable\nas he was, he could scarcely believe that the glory of God was the\nmotive power in the mind of Farmer John.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nFAIRY FAITH.\n\n\nAt the beginning of July, work was proceeding steadily, though not quite\nso merrily perhaps, as some of the workmen might have wished; because\nMr. Penniloe had forbidden the presence of beer-cans in consecrated\nground. A large firm of builders at Exeter (Messrs. Peveril, Gibbs &\nCo.) had taken the contract according to Mr. Horner's specifications;\nand had sent a strong staff of workmen down, under an active junior\npartner, Mr. Robson Adney. There are very few noises that cannot find\nsome ear to which they are congenial; and the clink of the mason's\ntrowel is a delight to many good people. But that pleasant sound is\nreplaced, too often, by one of sadder harmony--the chink of coin that\nsays adieu, with all the regret behind it.\n\nPerlycross had started well on this, its greatest enterprise; every man\nwas astonished at his neighbour's generosity, and with still better\nreason at his own. Mr. Penniloe's spirit rose above the solid necessity\nof repairs, and aspired to richer embellishment. That hideous gallery at\nthe western end, which spoiled the tower entrance and obscured a fine\nwindow, should go into the fire at last; the noble arch of the chancel\n(which had been shored with timber braces) should be restored and\nreopened, and the blocked-up windows should again display their lovely\ncarving. In the handsomest manner, Sir Thomas Waldron had sent him a\ncheque for five hundred pounds; which after all was only just, because\nthe vaults of the Waldron race lay at the bottom of half the lapse. The\nDean and Chapter of Exeter had contributed a hundred pounds; and the\nRector another hundred; and the Curate's own father--an ancient\nclergyman in the north of Devon, with a tidy living and a plump\nestate--had gone as far as twenty pounds, for the honour of the family.\n\nWith this money in hand, and much more in hope, all present designs\nmight well be compassed. But alas, a new temptation rose, very charming,\nand very costly. The Curate had long suspected that his favourite church\nhad been endowed (like its smaller sister at Perlycombe) with a fair\nrood-screen; perhaps a fine one, worthy of the days, when men could\ncarve. And now, when the heavy wooden gallery of Queen Anne's time had\nbeen removed, it happened that Sergeant Jakes, the schoolmaster, who had\nseen a great deal of old work in Spain, was minded to enquire into the\nbearings of the great bressemer at the back. He put his foot into a hole\nbeneath it, where solid brickwork was supposed to be; but down went his\nfoot into a lot of crumbling stuff, and being no more than a one-armed\nman, Mr. Jakes had a narrow escape of his neck. Luckily he clung with\nhis one hand to a crossbeam still in position, and being of a very wiry\nframe--as all the school-children knew too well--was enabled to support\nhimself, until a ladder was clapped to. Even then it was no easy thing\nto extricate his foot, wedged between two trefoils of sharply cut stone;\nand for more than a week it was beyond his power to bring any fugitive\nboy to justice. The Parson was sent for at once, and discovered the\nfinest stone-screen in the diocese, removed from its place by a\nbarbarous age, and plastered up in the great western wall.\n\nThere was little of that hot contention then, which rages now over every\nstock and stone appertaining to the Church. As the beauty of design, and\nthe skill of execution, grew more and more manifest to his delighted\neyes, Mr. Penniloe was troubled with no misgivings as to \"graven\nimages.\" He might do what he liked with this grand piece of work, if the\nmoney were forthcoming. And the parish suspected no Popery in it, when\nafter much council with all concerned, and holding the needful faculty,\nhe proposed to set up this magnificent screen as a reredos beneath the\ngreat Chancel window, and behind the stone Communion-table, generally\ncalled the Altar now.\n\nYet brave as he was and of ardent faith, some little dismay was natural,\nwhen the builders assured him that this could not be done, with all\nneedful repairs and proper finish, for less than three hundred and fifty\npounds, and they would not even bind themselves to that; for the\noriginal was of the best Beere stone, difficult to match, and hard to\nwork. Mr. Penniloe went to the quarries, and found that this was no\nexaggeration; and having some faith in mankind--as all who have much in\ntheir Maker must have--he empowered the firm to undertake the task,\nwhile he cast about zealously for the cash.\n\nWith filial confidence he made sure that his reverend father must\nrejoice in another opportunity for glorifying God; and to that effect he\naddressed him. But when the postman wound his horn at the bottom of the\nvillage, and the Parson hurried down from the churchyard to meet him, at\nthe expense of eightpence he received the following dry epistle.\n\n\n     \"SON PHILIP,--We are much surprised and pained by your\n     extraordinary letter. You speak very largely of 'duty to God,'\n     which ought to be done, without talking of it; while you think\n     lightly of your duty to your parents, the commandment that carries\n     the blessing. If you had not abandoned your Fellowship, by marrying\n     and having a family, it might have been more in your power to think\n     of Church-windows, and stone-carving. We did not expect to be\n     treated like this, after our very handsome gift, of not more than\n     three months agone. Look for no more money; but for that which a\n     good son values more, and earns by keeping within his income--the\n     love of his affectionate parents,\n\n     \"ISAAC, AND JOAN PENNILOE.\"\n\n\n\"Ah! ah! Well, well, I dare say I was wrong. But I thought that he could\nafford it;\" said the Curate in his simple way: \"'tis a sad day for me\naltogether. But I will not be cast down, for the Lord knoweth best.\"\n\nFor on this very day, a year ago, he had lost the happiness of his life,\nand the one love of his manhood. His fair wife (a loyal and tender\nhelpmate, the mother of his three children, and the skilful steward of\nhis small means) had been found lying dead at the foot of the \"Horseshoe\nPitch,\" beneath Hagdon Hill. While her husband was obliged to remain in\nthe village, waiting for a funeral, she had set forth, with none but her\nyounger boy Michael, to visit an old woman on the outskirts of the\nparish, very far advanced in years, but still a very backward Christian.\n\nThe old woman was living at the present moment, but could throw no light\nupon her visitor's sad fate, and indeed denied that she had seen her on\nthat day. And the poor child who must have beheld what happened, though\nhitherto a very quick and clever little fellow, could never be brought\nto say a word about it. Having scarcely recovered from a sharp attack of\nmeasles, he had lost his wits through terror, and ran all the way home\nat the top of his speed, shouting \"Rabbits! Rabbits! Rabbits!\"\n\nFrom the child's sad condition, and a strict search of the \"Horseshoe,\"\nit appeared that he had leaped after his poor mother, but had been saved\nfrom death by a ledge of brambles and furze which had broken his fall.\nEven now, though all trace of his bruises was gone, and his blue eyes\nwere as bright as ever, the tender young brain was so dazed and daunted,\nby the fall, and the fright, and agony, that the children of the village\nchanged his nickname from \"Merry Michael,\" to \"Mazed Mikey.\"\n\nMr. Penniloe had been fighting bravely against the sad memories of this\nday. To a deeply religious mind like his, despondency was of the nature\nof doubt, and sorrow long indulged grew into sin. But now a cloud of\ndarkness fell around him; the waves of the flood went over his soul, his\nheart was afflicted, and in sore trouble; and there was none to deliver\nhim.\n\nAll men have their times of depression; but few feel such agonies of\ndejection, as the firm believer and lover of his faith, when harrowing\ndoubts assail him. The Rector of Perlycross, Mr. Chevithorne, though by\nno means a man of vast piety, had a short way of dealing with such\nattacks, which he always found successful. To his certain knowledge, all\ndebility of faith sprang directly from \"lowness of the system;\" and his\nremedy against all such complaints was a glass of hot brandy and water.\nBut his Curate's religion was a less robust, because a far more active\npower; and his keener mind was not content to repel all such sallies, as\ntemptations of the Devil.\n\nSensitive, diffident, and soft-hearted, he was apt to feel too acutely\nany wound to his affections; and of all the world now left to him, the\ndearest one was his mother. Or at any rate, he thought so for the\npresent; though a certain little tender claim was creeping closer and\ncloser into the inmost cell of love.\n\n\"Can mother have forgotten what day it would be, when I should receive\nthese cruel words?\" he said to himself, as he went sadly up the hill\ntowards his white-washed dwelling-place, having no heart left for the\nfinest of stone-carvings. \"If she did, it was not like her; and if she\nremembered, it seems still worse. Surely he would not have dared to sign\nher name, without her knowledge. But whenever he thinks of that\nFellowship--well, perhaps it was wrong on my part to attempt so much. It\nis high time to look more closely into ways and means.\"\n\nThat was the proper thing to do beyond a doubt, and he hastened inside\nto do it. But when he sat in his lonely bookroom, with the evening\nshadows of the dark ilex slowly creeping over him, his mind went back\ninto the past, and a mighty sadness conquered him. Instead of the list\nof subscriptions for the church he had drawn from the long portfolio\n(which his wife had given him on the last wedding-day they should ever\nkeep together) a copy of a sad despondent hymn, which he had written in\nthe newness of his grief. As he read the forgotten lines, once more\ntheir deep gloom encompassed him; even the twinkle of hope, in which\nthey ended, seemed a mockery.\n\n\"Will it ever be so, or is it all a dream, inspired by our longings, and\nour self-conceit? Whatever is pleasant, or good, or precious, is\nsnatched from our grasp; and we call it a trial, and live on, in the\nbelief that we are punished for our good, and shall be rewarded tenfold.\nIf so, it can be for those alone who are able to believe always; who can\ndismiss every shadow of doubt, and live with their Maker face to face.\nOh that I could do so. But I cannot; my shallow mind is vexed by every\nbreeze. When I was a young man, I felt pity, and even contempt for\nGowler's unfaith--a man of far superior powers. He gave up his\nFellowship, like a conscientious man; while I preach to others, and am\nmyself a castaway. Oh, Ruth, Ruth, if you could only see me!\"\n\nThis man of holy life, and of pure devotion to his sacred office, bent\nhis head low in the agony of the moment, and clasped his hands over his\nwhitening hair. How far he was out of his proper mind was shown by his\nsitting in the sacred chair,[1] the old \"dropping-chair\" of the parish,\nwhich had been sent back that morning. Of this, and of all around, he\ntook no heed; for the tide of his life was at the lowest ebb, and his\nfeeble heart was fluttering, like a weed in shallow water.\n\nBut his comfort was not far to seek. After sundry soft taps, and a\nshuffle of the handle, the door was opened quietly, and a little girl\ncame dancing in, bringing a gleam of summer sunshine in a cloud of\ngolden hair. The gloom of the cold room fled, as if it had no business\nnear her, and a thrush outside (who knew her well) broke forth into a\ngratitude of song. For this was little Faith Penniloe, seven years old\nlast Tuesday, the prettiest and the liveliest soul in all the parish of\nPerlycross; and Faith being too substantial perhaps, everybody called\nher \"Fay,\" or \"Fairy.\" Nothing ever troubled her, except the letter _r_,\nand even that only when it wanted to come first.\n\n\"Father, fathery, how much colder is the tea to get?\" she cried; \"I call\nit very yude of you, to do what you like, because you happen to be\nolder.\"\n\nAs the little girl ran, with her arms stretched forth, and a smile on\nher lips that was surety for a kiss--a sudden amazement stopped her. The\nfather of her love and trust and worship, was not even looking at her;\nhis face was cold and turned away; his arms were not spread for a jump\nand a scream. He might as well have no child at all, or none to whom he\nwas all in all. For a moment her simple heart was daunted, her dimpled\nhands fell on her pinafore, and the sparkle of her blue eyes became a\ngleam of tears.\n\nThen she gathered up her courage, which had never known repulse, and\ncame and stood between her father's knees, and looked up at him very\ntenderly, as if she had grieved him, and yearned to be forgiven.\n\n\"Child, you have taught me the secret of faith,\" he cried, with a sudden\nlight shed on him; \"I will go as a little one to my Father, without a\nword, and look up at Him.\"\n\nThen, as he lifted her into his lap, and she threw her arms around his\nneck, he felt that he was not alone in the world, and the warmth of his\nheart returned to him.\n\nFOOTNOTE:\n\n[1] In country parishes an easy-chair, for the use of the sick and\nelderly, was provided from the Communion offerings, and lent to those\nmost in need of it. When not so required, it was kept under cover, and\nregarded with some reverence, from its origin and use.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nTHE LYCH-GATE.\n\n\nThe old church, standing on a bluff above the river, is well placed for\nlooking up and down the fertile valley. Flashes of the water on its\nwestward course may be caught from this point of vantage, amidst the\ntranquillity of ancient trees and sunny breadths of pasture. For there\nthe land has smoothed itself into a smiling plain, casting off the\nwrinkles of hills and gullies, and the frown of shaggy brows of heather.\nThe rigour of the long flinty range is past, and a flower can stand\nwithout a bush to back it, and the wind has ceased from shuddering.\n\nBut the Perle has not come to these pleasures yet, as it flows on the\nnorth of the churchyard, and some hundred feet beneath it. The broad\nshallow channel is strewn with flint, and the little stream cannot fill\nit, except in times of heavy flood; for the main of its water has been\ndiverted to work the woollen factory, and rejoins the natural course at\nthe bridge two or three hundred yards below. On the further side, the\nland rises to the barren height of Beacon Hill, which shelters Sir\nThomas Waldron's house, and is by its conical form distinct from other\nextremities of the Black-down Chain. For the southern barrier of the\nvalley (which is about three miles wide at its mouth) is formed by the\nlong dark chine of Hagdon Hill, which ends abruptly in a steep descent;\nand seeing that all this part of the vale, and the hills which shape it,\nare comprised in the parish of Perlycross, it will become clear that a\nsingle Parson, if he attempts to go through all his work, must have a\nvery fine pair of legs, and a sound constitution to quicken them.\n\nMr. Penniloe, now well advanced in the fifth decade, was of very spare\nhabit and active frame, remarkable also for his springy gait, except at\nthose periods of dark depression, with which he was afflicted now and\nthen. But the leading fault of his character was inattention to his\nvictuals, not from any want of common sense, or crude delight in\nfasting, but rather through self-neglect, and the loss of the one who\nused to attend to him. To see to that bodily welfare, about which he\ncared so little, there was no one left, except a careful active and\ndevoted servant, Thyatira Muggridge. Thyatira had been in his employment\never since his marriage, and was now the cook, housekeeper, and general\nmanager at the rectory. But though in the thirty-fifth year of her age,\nand as steady as a pyramid, she felt herself still too young to urge\nsound dietary advice upon her master, as she longed to do. The women of\nthe parish blamed her sadly, as they watched his want of fattening; but\nshe could only sigh, and try to tempt him with her simple skill, and\nzeal.\n\nOn the morrow of that sad anniversary which had caused him such\ndistress, the Curate was blest with his usual vigour of faith and\ncourage and philanthropy. An affectionate letter from his mother,\nenclosing a bank-order for ten pounds, had proved that she was no\nwilling partner in the father's harshness. The day was very bright, his\nthree pupils had left him for their summer holidays, and there happened\nto be no urgent call for any parochial visits. There was nothing to stop\nhim from a good turn to-day among trowel and chisel and callipers; he\nwould see that every man was at his work, and that every stroke of work\nwas truthful.\n\nHaving slurred his early dinner with his usual zest, he was hastening\ndown the passage for his hat and stick, when Thyatira Muggridge came\nupon him from the pantry, with a jug of toast-and-water in her hand.\n\n\"Do'e give me just a minute, sir,\" she whispered, with a glance at the\ndoor of the dining-room where the children had been left; and he\nfollowed her into the narrow back-parlour, the head-quarters of his\nabsent pupils.\n\nMr. Penniloe thought very highly of his housekeeper's judgment and\ndiscretion, and the more so perhaps because she had been converted, by a\nstroke of his own readiness, from the doctrines of the\n\"Antip\u00c3\u00a6edo-Baptists\"--as they used to call themselves--to those of the\nChurch of England. Her father, moreover, was one of the chief tenants on\nthe North Devon property of Mr. Penniloe the elder; and simplicity,\nshrewdness, and honesty were established in that family. So her master\nwas patient with her, though his hat and stick were urgent.\n\n\"Would you please to mind, sir,\"--began Thyatira, with her thick red\narms moving over her apron, like rolling-pins upon pie-crust--\"if little\nMaster Mike was to sleep with me a bit, till his brother Master Harry\ncometh back from school?\"\n\n\"I dare say you have some good reason for asking; but what is it, Mrs.\nMuggeridge?\" The housekeeper was a spinster, but had received\nbrevet-rank from the village.\n\n\"Only that he is so lonesome, sir, in that end hattick, by his little\nself. You know how he hath been, ever since his great scare; and now\nsome brutes of boys in the village have been telling him a lot of stuff\nabout Spring-heel Jack. They say he is coming into this part now, with\nhis bloody heart and dark lantern. And the poor little lamb hath a\nwindow that looks right away over the churchyard. Last night he were\nsobbing so in his sleep, enough to break his little heart. The sound\ncame all across the lumber-room, till I went and fetched him into my\nbed, and then he were as happy as an Angel.\"\n\n\"Poor little man! I should have thought of it, since he became so\nnervous. But I have always tried to make my children feel that the Lord\nis ever near them.\"\n\n\"He compasseth the righteous round about,\" Mrs. Muggeridge replied with\na curtsey, as a pious woman quoting Holy Writ; \"but for all that, you\ncan't call Him company, sir; and that's what these little one's lacks\nof. Master Harry is as brave as a lion, because he is so much older.\nBut hoping no offence, his own dear mother would never have left that\nlittle soul all by himself.\"\n\n\"You are right, and I was wrong;\" replied the master, concealing the\npain her words had caused. \"Take him to your room; it is very kind of\nyou. But where will you put Susanna?\"\n\n\"That will be easy enough, sir. I will make up a bed in the lumber-room,\nif you have no objection. Less time for her at the looking-glass, I\nreckon.\"\n\nMr. Penniloe smiled gravely--for that grievance was a classic--and had\nonce more possessed himself of his hat and stick, when the earnest\nhousekeeper detained him once again.\n\n\"If you please, sir, you don't believe, do you now, in all that they\nsays about that Spring-heeled Jack? It scarcely seemeth reasonable to a\nChristian mind. And yet when I questioned Mr. Jakes about it, he was not\nfor denying that there might be such a thing--and him the very bravest\nman in all this parish!\"\n\n\"Mrs. Muggeridge, it is nonsense. Mr. Jakes knows better. He must have\nbeen trying to terrify you. A man who has been through the Peninsular\ncampaign! I hope I may remember to reprove him.\"\n\n\"Oh no, I would beg you, sir, not to do that. It was only said--as one\nmight express it, promiscuous, and in a manner of speaking. I would\nnever have mentioned it, if I had thought----\"\n\nKnowing that her face was very red, her master refrained from looking at\nit, and went his way at last, after promising to let the gallant Jakes\nescape. It was not much more than a hundred yards, along the chief\nstreet of the village, from the rectory to the southern and chief\nentrance of the churchyard; opposite to which, at a corner of the road\nand partly in front of the ruined Abbey, stood an old-fashioned Inn, the\n_Ivy-bush_. This, though a very well conducted house, and quiet enough\n(except at Fair-time), was not in the Parson's opinion a pleasing\ninduction to the lych-gate; but there it had stood for generations, and\nthe landlord, Walter Haddon, held sound Church-views, for his wife had\nbeen a daughter of Channing the clerk, and his premises belonged to the\nDean and Chapter.\n\nMr. Penniloe glanced at the yellow porch, with his usual regret but no\nill-will, when a flash of bright colour caught his eye. In the outer\ncorner he described a long scarlet fishing-rod propped against the wall,\nwith the collar and three flies fluttering. All was so bright and spick\nand span, that a trout's admiration would be quite safe; and the\nclergyman (having been a skilful angler, till his strict views of duty\ndeprived him of that joy) indulged in a smile of sagacity, as he opened\nhis double eye-glass, and scrutinised this fine object.\n\n\"Examining my flies, are you, Reverend? Well, I hope you are satisfied\nwith them.\"\n\nThe gentleman who spoke in this short way came out of the porch, with a\npipe in his hand and a large fishing-creel swinging under his left arm.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, Dr. Gronow, for the liberty I am taking. Yes, they\nare very fine flies indeed. I hope you have had good sport with them.\"\n\n\"Pretty fair, sir; pretty fair\"--the owner answered cheerfully--\"one\nmust not expect much in this weather. But I have had at least three\nrises.\"\n\n\"It is much to your credit, so far as I can judge, under the\ncircumstances. And you have not had time to know our water yet. You will\nfind it pretty fishing, when you get accustomed to it.\"\n\nThe angler, a tall thin man of sixty, with a keen grave face and wiry\ngray hair, regarded the Parson steadfastly. This was but the second time\nthey had met, although Dr. Gronow had been for some while an important\nparishioner of Perlycross, having bought a fair estate at Priestwell, a\nhamlet little more than a mile from the village. People, who pretended\nto know all about him, said that he had retired suddenly, for some\nunknown reason, from long and large medical practice at Bath. There he\nhad been, as they declared, the first authority in all cases of\ndifficulty and danger, but not at all a favourite in the world of\nfashion, because of his rough and contemptuous manners, and sad want of\nsympathy with petty ailments. Some pious old lady of rank had called\nhim, in a passionate moment, \"the Godless Gronow;\" and whether he\ndeserved the description or not, it had cleaved to him like a\nsand-leech. But the Doctor only smiled, and went his way; the good will\nof the poor was sweeter to him than the good word of the wealthy.\n\n\"Let me say a word to you, Mr. Penniloe,\" he began, as the Curate was\nturning away; \"I have had it in my mind for some short time. I believe\nyou are much attached to Sir Thomas Waldron.\"\n\n\"He is one of my oldest and most valued friends. I have the highest\npossible regard for him.\"\n\n\"He is a valuable man in the parish, I suppose--comes to church\nregularly--sets a good example?\"\n\n\"If all my parishioners were like him, it would be a comfort to me,\nand--and a benefit to them.\"\n\n\"Well said--according to your point of view. I like a straightforward\nman, sir. But I want you to be a little crooked now. You have an old\nfriend, Harrison Gowler.\"\n\n\"Yes,\"--Mr. Penniloe replied with some surprise, \"I was very fond of\nGowler at Oxford, and admired him very greatly. But I have not seen him\nfor some years.\"\n\n\"He is now the first man in London in his special line. Could you get\nhim to visit you for a day or two, and see Sir Thomas Waldron, without\nletting him know why?\"\n\n\"You astonish me, Dr. Gronow. There is nothing amiss with Sir Thomas,\nexcept a little trouble now and then, caused by an ancient wound, I\nbelieve.\"\n\n\"Ah, so you think; and so perhaps does he. But I suppose you can keep a\nthing to yourself. If I tell you something, will you give me your word\nthat it shall go no further?\"\n\nThe two gentlemen were standing in the shadow of the lych-gate, as a\nshelter from the July sun, while the clergyman gazed with much alarm at\nthe other, and gave the required promise. Dr. Gronow looked round, and\nthen said in a low voice--\n\n\"Sir Thomas is a strong and temperate man, and has great powers of\nendurance. I hope most heartily that I may be wrong. But I am convinced\nthat within three months, he will be lying upon this stone; while you\nwith your surplice on are standing in that porch, waiting for the\nbearers to advance.\"\n\n\"Good God!\" cried the Parson, with tears rushing to his eyes; then he\nlifted his hat, and bowed reverently. \"May He forgive me for using His\nholy name. But the shock is too terrible to think of. It would certainly\nbreak poor Nicie's heart. What right have you to speak of such a\ndreadful thing?\"\n\n\"Is it such a dreadful thing to go to heaven? That of course you\nguarantee for your good friends. But the point is--how to put off that\ncatastrophe of bliss.\"\n\n\"Flippancy is not the way to meet it, Dr. Gronow. We have every right to\ntry to keep a valuable life, and a life dear to all that have the sense\nto feel its value. Even a scornful man--such as you appear to be, unable\nto perceive the childish littleness of scorn--must admire valour, sense\nof duty, and simplicity; though they may not be his own leading\nqualities. And once more I ask you to explain what you have said.\"\n\n\"You know Jemmy Fox pretty well, I think?\" Dr. Gronow took a seat upon\nthe coffin-stone, and spoke as if he liked the Parson's vigour--\"Jemmy\nis a very clever fellow in his way, though of course he has no\nexperience yet. We old stagers are always glad to help a young member of\nour Profession, who has a proper love for it, and is modest, and\nhard-working. But not until he asks us, you must clearly understand. You\nsee we are not so meddlesome as you Reverends are. Well, from the\naccount young Fox gives me, there can, I fear, be little doubt about the\nnature of the case. It is not at all a common one; and so far as we know\nyet, there is but one remedy--a very difficult operation.\"\n\nMr. Penniloe was liable to a kind of nervous quivering, when anything\nhappened to excite him, and some of his very best sermons had been\nspoiled by this visitation.\n\n\"I am troubled more than I can tell you,--I am grieved beyond\ndescription,\"--he began with an utterance which trembled more and more;\n\"and you think that Gowler is the only man, to--to----\"\n\n\"To know the proper course, and to afford him the last chance. Gowler is\nnot a surgeon, as I need not tell you. And at present such a case could\nbe dealt with best in Paris, although we have young men rising now, who\nwill make it otherwise before very long. Sir Thomas will listen to\nnothing, I fear, from a young practitioner like Fox. He has been so\nknocked about himself, and so close to death's door more than once, that\nhe looks upon this as a fuss about nothing. But I know better, Mr.\nPenniloe.\"\n\n\"You are too likely to be right. Fox has told me of several cases of\nyour wonderful penetration. That young man thinks so much of you. Oh,\nDr. Gronow, I implore you as a man--whatever your own opinions are--say\nnothing to unsettle that young fellow's mind. You know not the misery\nyou may cause, and you cannot produce any happiness. I speak--I speak\nwith the strongest feelings. You will think that I should not have\nspoken at all--and I dare say it is unusual. But you will forgive me,\nwhen you remember it is my duty as a clergyman.\"\n\n\"Surely you are responsible for me as well\"--replied the doctor with a\nkinder tone; \"but perhaps you regard me as beyond all cure. Well, I will\npromise what you ask, good sir. Your sheep, or your foxes, shall not\nstray through me. Will you do what I suggest about Gowler?\"\n\n\"I will try to get him down. But from all that I hear, he is one of the\nbusiest men in London. And I dislike procuring his opinion on the sly.\nExcuse me--I know how well you meant it. But perhaps, through Lady\nWaldron, he may be brought down in the regular course, and have the\nwhole case laid before him.\"\n\n\"That would be the best thing, if it could be managed. Good-bye! I go\na-fishing, as your prototypes expressed it.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nNICIE.\n\n\nIn the bright summer sunshine the old church looked like a ship that had\nbeen shattered by the waves, and was hoisted in a dry dock for repairs.\nTo an ignorant eye it appeared to be in peril of foundering and plunging\ninto the depths below, so frequent and large were the rifts and chasms\nyawning in the ancient frame-work. Especially was there one long gap in\nthe footings of the south chancel wall, where three broad arches were\nbeing turned, and a solid buttress rising, to make good the weakness of\nthe Waldron vault. Sacks of lime, and piles of sand, coils of cord and\nblocks of stone, scaffold-poles and timber-baulks, wheel-barrows\ngrovelling upside-down, shovels and hods and planks and ladders, hats\nupon tombstones, and jackets on graves, sacred niches garnished with\ntobacco-pipes, and pious memories enlivened by \"Jim Crow\"--so cheerful\nwas the British workman, before he was educated.\n\n\"Parson coming,\" was whispered round, while pewter pots jumped under\nslabs, and jugs had coats thrown over them, for Mr. Penniloe would have\nnone of their drinking in the churchyard, and was loth to believe that\nthey could do it, with all the sad examples beneath them. But now his\nmind was filled with deeper troubles; and even the purpose of his visit\nhad faded from his memory.\n\n\"Just in time, sir. I was waiting for you\"--said Mr. Robson Adney,\nstanding in front of the shored-up screen, on the southern side of the\ntower,--\"if it bears the strain of this new plinth, the rest is a matter\nof detail. Your idea of the brace was capital, and the dovetail will\nnever show at all. Now, Charlie, steady there--not too heavy. Five\nminutes will show whether we are men or muffs. But don't stand quite so\nclose, sir, I think we have got it all right; but if there should happen\nto be a bit of cross-grain stone--bear to the left, you lubber there!\nBeg your pardon, sir--but I never said--'damn.'\"\n\n\"I hope not, I hope not, Mr. Adney. You remember where you are, too well\nfor that. Though I trust that you would say it nowhere. Ah, it is a\nlittle on the warp, I fear.\"\n\n\"No, sir, no. Go to the end, and look along. It is only the bevel that\nmakes it look so. Could hardly be better if the Lord Himself had made\nit. Trust Peveril, Gibbs, & Co. for knowing their work. Holloa! not so\nhard--ease her, ease her! Stand clear for your lives, men! Down she\ncomes.\"\n\nThey were none too quick, for the great stone screen, after bulging and\nsagging and shaking like a cobweb throughout its massive tracery, parted\nin the middle and fell mightily.\n\n\"Any one hurt? Then you haven't got what you ought\"--shouted Adney, with\nhis foot upon a pinnacle--\"old Peter made a saint of? Get a roller, and\nfetch him out. None the worse, old chap, are you now? Take him to the\n_Ivy-bush_, and get a drop of brandy.\"\n\nSudden as the crash had been, no life was lost, no limb broken, and\nscarcely a bruise received, except by an elderly workman, and he was\nlittle the worse, being safely enshrined in the niche where some good\nsaint had stood. Being set upon his feet, he rubbed his elbows, and then\nswore a little; therefore naturally enough he was known as \"St. Peter,\"\nfor the residue of his life among us.\n\nBut no sooner did Mr. Adney see that no one was hurt seriously than he\nbegan to swear anything but a little, instead of thanking Providence.\n\n\"A pretty job--a fine job, by the holy poker!\" he kept on exclaiming, as\nhe danced among the ruins; \"why, they'll laugh at us all over\nDevonshire. And that's not the worst of it. By the Lord, I wish it was.\nThree or four hundred pounds out of our pockets. A nice set of ----\nfellows you are, aren't you? I wish I might go this very moment----\"\n\n\"Is this all your gratitude, Robson Adney, for the goodness of the Lord\nto you?\" Mr. Penniloe had been outside the crash, as he happened to be\nwatching from one end the adjustment of the piece inserted. \"What are a\nfew bits of broken stone, compared with the life of a human being--cut\noff perhaps with an oath upon his lips, close to the very house of God?\nIn truth, this is a merciful deliverance. Down upon your knees, my\nfriends, and follow me in a few simple words of acknowledgment to the\nGiver of all good. Truly He hath been gracious to us.\"\n\n\"Don't want much more of that sort of grace. _Coup de grace_ I call\nit\"--muttered Mr. Adney. Nevertheless he knelt down, with the dust upon\nhis forehead; and the workmen did the like; for here was another month's\ngood wages.\n\nMr. Penniloe always spoke well and readily, when his heart was urgent;\nand now as he knelt between two lowly graves, the men were wondering at\nhim. \"Never thought a' could have dooed it, without his gown!\" \"Why, a'\nput up his two hands, as if 'twor money in his pockets!\" \"Blest if I\ndon't send for he, when my time cometh!\" \"Faix, sor, but the Almighty\nmust be proud of you to spake for Him!\" Thus they received it; and the\nsenior Churchwarden coming in to see the rights of the matter, told\nevery one (when he recovered his wits) that he had never felt so proud\nof the parish minister before. Even the Parson felt warmly in his heart\nthat he had gone up in their opinions; which made him more diffident in\nhis own.\n\n\"Don't 'e be cast down, sir,\" said one fine fellow, whom the heavy\narchitrave had missed by about an inch, saving a young widow and seven\nlittle orphans. \"We will put it all to rights, in next to no time. You\ndo put up with it, uncommon fine. Though the Lord may have laboured to\ntempt 'e, like Job. But I han't heard a single curse come out of your\nlips--not but what it might, without my knowing. But here coom'th a\nyoung man in bright clothes with news for 'e.\"\n\nMr. Penniloe turned, and behold it was Bob Cornish, one of his best\nSunday-school boys last year, patient and humble in a suit of corduroy;\nbut now gay and lordly in the livery of the Waldrons, buff with blue\nedgings, and buttons of bright gold. His father sold rushlights at the\nbottom of the village, but his mother spent her time in thinking.\n\n\"From Sir Thomas?\" asked the Curate, as the lad with some attempt at a\nsoldier's salute produced a note, folded like a cocked hat, and not easy\nto undo.\n\n\"No, sir, from my lady\"--answered Robert, falling back.\n\nMr. Penniloe was happy enough to believe that all things are ordered and\nguided for us by supreme goodness and wisdom. But nature insisted that\nhis hands should tremble at anything of gravity to any one he loved; and\nnow after Dr. Gronow's warning, his double eyeglass rattled in its\ntortoiseshell frame, as he turned it upon the following words.\n\n\n     \"DEAR SIR,--I am in great uncertainty to trouble you with this, and\n     beg you to accept apologies. But my husband is in pain of the most\n     violent again, and none the less of misery that he conceals it from\n     me. In this country I have no one now from whom to seek good\n     counsel, and the young Dr. Fox is too juvenile to trust in. My\n     husband has so much value for your wise opinion. I therefore take\n     the liberty of imploring you to come, but with discretion not to\n     speak the cause to Sir Thomas Waldron, for he will not permit\n     conversation about it. Sincerely yours,\n\n     \"ISABEL WALDRON.\"\n\n\nMr. Penniloe read these words again, and then closed his eyeglass with a\nheavy sigh. Trusted and beloved friend as he was of the veteran Sir\nThomas, he had never been regarded with much favour by the lady of the\nhouse. By birth and by blood on the father's side, this lady was a\nSpaniard; and although she spoke English fluently--much better indeed\nthan she wrote it--the country and people were not to her liking, and\nshe cared not to make herself popular. Hence her fine qualities, and\ngenerous nature, were misprised and undervalued, until less and less was\nseen of them. Without deserving it, she thus obtained the repute of a\nhaughty cold-hearted person, without affection, sympathy, or\nloving-kindness. Even Mr. Penniloe, the most charitable of men, was\ninclined to hold this opinion of her.\n\nTherefore he was all the more alarmed by this letter of the stately\nlady. Leaving Mr. Adney to do his best, he set off at once for\nWalderscourt, by way of the plank-bridge over the Perle, at no great\ndistance above the church; and then across the meadows and the sloping\ncornland, with the round Beacon-hill in front of him. This path, saving\nnearly half a mile of twisting lanes, would lead him to the house almost\nas soon as the messenger's horse would be there.\n\nTo any one acquainted with the Parson it would prove how much his mind\nwas disturbed that none of the fair sights around him were heeded. The\ntall wheat reared upon its jointed stalk, with the buff pollen shed, and\nthe triple awns sheltering the infancy of grain, the delicate bells of\nsky-blue flax quivering on lanced foliage, the glistening cones of\nteasels pliant yet as tasselled silk, and the burly foxglove in the\nhedgerow turning back its spotted cuffs--at none of these did he care to\nglance, nor linger for a moment at the treddled stile, from which the\nbroad valley he had left was shown, studded with brown farm and white\ncottage, and looped with glittering water.\n\nNeither did he throw his stick into his left hand, and stretch forth the\nright--as his custom was in the lonely walks of a Saturday--to\ninvigorate a hit he would deliver the next day, at Divine service in the\nschoolroom.\n\n\"What is to become of them? What can be done to help it? Why should such\na loving child have such a frightful trial? How shall we let him know\nhis danger, without risk of doubling it? How long will it take, to get\nGowler down, and can he do any good, if he comes?\"--These and other such\nquestions drove from his mind both sermon and scenery, as he hastened to\nthe home of the Waldrons.\n\nWalderscourt was not so grand as to look uncomfortable, not yet on the\nother hand so lowly as to seem insignificant. But a large old-fashioned\nhouse, built of stone, with depth and variety of light and shade,\nsobered and toned by the lapse of time, yet cheerful on the whole, as is\na well-spent life. For by reason of the trees, and the wavering of the\nair--flowing gently from hill to valley--the sun seemed to linger in\nvarious visits, rather than to plant himself for one long stare. The\npleasure-grounds, moreover, and the lawns were large, gifted with\nsurprising little ups and downs, and blest with pretty corners where a\nman might sit and think, and perhaps espy an old-fashioned flower unseen\nsince he was five years old.\n\nSome of the many philosophers who understand our ways, and can account\nfor everything, declare that we of the human race become of such and\nsuch a vein, and turn, and tone of character, according to the flow, and\nbend, and tinge of early circumstance. If there be any truth in this, it\nwill help to account for a few of the many delightful features and\nloveable traits in the character of Nicie Waldron. That young lady, the\nonly daughter of the veteran Colonel, had obtained her present Christian\nname by her own merits, as asserted by herself. Unlike her mother she\nhad taken kindly to this English air and soil, as behoves a native; and\nher childish lips finding _Inez_ hard had softened it into _Nicie_. That\nname appeared so apt to all who had the pleasure of seeing her toddle,\nthat it quite superseded the grander form, with all except her mother.\n\"_Nicie_ indeed!\" Lady Waldron used to say, until she found it\nuseless--\"I will feel much obliged to you, if you shall call my daughter\nInez by her proper name, sir.\" But her ladyship could no more subdue the\nuniversal usage, than master the English _wills_ and _shalls_.\n\nAnd though she was now a full-grown maiden, lively, tall, and\nself-possessed, Nicie had not lost as yet the gentle and confiding\nmanner, with the playful smile, and pleasant glance, which had earned,\nby offering them, good-will and tender interest. Pity moreover had some\nshare in her general popularity, inasmuch as her mother was known to be\nsometimes harsh, and nearly always cold and distant to her. Women, who\nshould know best, declared that this was the result of jealousy, because\nSir Thomas made such an idol of his loving daughter. On the other hand\nthe Spanish lady had her idol also--her only son, despatched of late\nwith his regiment towards India; his father always called him _Tom_, and\nhis mother _Rodrigo_.\n\nMr. Penniloe had a very soft place in his heart for this young lady; but\nnow, for the first time in his life, he was vexed to see her white chip\nhat, and pink summer-frock between the trees. She was sitting on a\nbench, with a book upon her lap, while the sunlight, broken by the\ngentle play of leafage, wavered and flickered in her rich brown hair.\nCorkscrew ringlets were the fashion of the time; but Nicie would have\nnone of them, with the bashful knowledge of the rose, that Nature had\ndone enough for her.\n\nAnd here came her father to take her part, with his usual decision;\ndaring even to pronounce, in presence of the noblest fashion, that his\npet should do what he chose, and nothing else. At this the pet smiled\nvery sweetly, the words being put into his lips by hers, and dutifully\nobeyed her own behest; sweeping back the flowing curves into a graceful\ncoronet, in the manner of a Laconian maid.\n\nNow the sly Penniloe made endeavour to pass her with a friendly smile\nand bow; but her little pug _Pixie_ would not hear of such a slight.\nThis was a thorough busybody, not always quite right in his mind,\naccording to some good authorities, though not easily outwitted. Having\nscarcely attained much obesity yet, in spite of never-flagging efforts,\nhe could run at a good pace, though not so very far; and sometimes, at\nsight of any highly valued friend, he would chase himself at full gallop\nround a giddy circle, with his reasoning powers lost in rapture.\n\nEven now he indulged in this expression of good-will, for he dearly\nloved Mr. Penniloe; and then he ran up, with such antics of delight,\nthat the rudest of mankind could not well have passed unheeding. And\nbehind him came his fair young mistress, smiling pleasantly at his\ntricks, although her gentle eyes were glistening with a shower scarcely\nblown away.\n\n\"Uncle Penniloe,\" she began, having thus entitled him in early days, and\ndoing so still at coaxing times; \"you will not think me a sly girl, will\nyou? But I found out that mother had sent for you; and as nothing would\nmake her tell me why, I made up my mind to come and ask you myself, if I\ncould only catch you here. I was sure you could never refuse me.\"\n\n\"Nice assurance indeed, and nice manners, to try to steal a march upon\nyour mother!\" The Parson did his utmost to look stern; but his eyes\nmeeting hers failed to carry it out.\n\n\"Oh, but you know better, you could never fancy that! And your trying to\nturn it off like that, only frightens me ten times more. I am sure it is\nsomething about my father. You had better tell me all. I must know all.\nI am too old now, to be treated like a child. Who can have half the\nright I have, to know all about my darling dad? Is he very ill? Is his\nprecious life in danger? Don't look at me like that. I know more than\nyou imagine. Is he going to die? I will never believe it. God could\nnever do such a cruel wicked thing.\"\n\n\"My dear, what would your dear father say, to hear you talk like that? A\nman so humble, and brave, and pious----\"\n\n\"As humble and brave as you please, Uncle Penniloe. But I don't want him\nto be pious for a long time yet. He swore a little yesterday,--that is\none comfort,--when he had no idea I was near him. And he would not have\ndone that, if there had been any--oh, don't go away so! I won't let you\ngo, until you have answered my question. Why were you sent for in such\nhaste?\"\n\n\"How can I tell you, my dear child, until I have had time to ask about\nit? You know there is to be the cricket-match on Tuesday, the north\nagainst the south side of the valley, and even the sides are not quite\nsettled yet; because Mr. Jakes will not play against his Colonel, though\nquite ready to play against his Parson.\"\n\n\"Will you give me your word, Uncle Penniloe, that you really believe you\nwere sent for about that?\"\n\nThe clergyman saw that there was no escape, and as he looked into her\nbeseeching eyes, it was all that he could do to refrain his own from\ntears.\n\n\"I will not cry--or at least not if I can help it,\" she whispered, as he\nled her to the seat, and sat by her.\n\n\"My darling Nicie,\" he began in a low voice, and as tenderly as if he\nwere her father; \"it has pleased the Lord to visit us with a very sad\ntrial; but we may hope that it will yet pass away. Your dear father is\nseriously ill; and the worst of it is that, with his wonderful courage\nand spirit, he makes light of it, and will not be persuaded. He could\nscarcely be induced to say a word to Dr. Fox, although he is so fond of\nhim; and nobody knows what the malady is, except that it is painful and\nwearing. My object to-day is to do my very utmost to get your dear\nfather to listen to us, and see a medical man of very large experience\nand very great ability. And much as it has grieved me to tell you this,\nperhaps it is better upon the whole; for now you will do all you can, to\nhelp us.\"\n\n\"Sometimes father will listen to me,\" Miss Waldron answered between her\nsobs; \"when he won't--when he won't let anybody else--because I never\nargue with him. But I thought Dr. Fox was exceedingly clever.\"\n\n\"So he is, my dear; but he is so young, and this is a case of great\nperplexity. I have reason to believe that he wishes just as we do. So\nnow with God's help let us all do our best.\"\n\nShe tried to look cheerful; but when he was gone, a cold terror fell\nupon her. Little _Pixie_ tugged at her frock unheeded, and made himself\na whirligig in chase of his own tail.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nA FAIR BARGAIN.\n\n\nThe Parson had a little shake in his system; and his faith in Higher\nProvidence was weaker in his friend's case than in his own, which is\ncontrary perhaps to the general rule. As he passed through the large\ngloomy hall, his hat was quivering in his hand, like a leaf that has\ncaught the syringe; and when he stood face to face with Lady Waldron, he\nwould have given up a small subscription, to be as calm as she was.\n\nBut her self-possession was the style of pride and habit, rather than\nthe gift of nature. No one could look into her very handsome face, or\nwatch her dark eyes as she spoke, without perceiving that her nature was\nstrong, and warm, and generous. Pride of birth taught her to control her\ntemper; but education had been insufficient to complete the mastery. And\nso she remained in a foreign country, vehement, prejudiced, and\nindifferent to things too large for her to understand, jealous,\nexacting, and quick to take offence; but at the same time a lover of\njustice, truthful, free-handed, and loyal to friends, kind to those in\ntrouble, and devoted to her husband. Her father had been of Spanish, and\nher mother of Irish birth, and her early memories were of tumult, war,\ndistress, and anarchy.\n\nAll English clergymen were to her as heretics and usurpers; and being\nintensely patriotic, she disliked the English nation for its services to\nher country. Mr. Penniloe had felt himself kept throughout at a very\nwell measured distance; but like a large-hearted, and humble man, had\nconcerned himself little about such trifles; though his wife had been\nvery indignant. And he met the lady now, as he had always done, with a\npleasant look, and a gentle smile. But she was a little annoyed at her\nown confession of his influence.\n\n\"It is good of you to come so soon,\" she said, \"and to break your very\nnice engagements. But I have been so anxious, so consumed with great\nanxiety. And everything grows worse and worse. What can I do? There is\nnone to help me. The only one I could trust entirely, my dear brother,\nis far away.\"\n\n\"There are many who would do their best to help you,\" the Curate\nanswered with a faltering voice, for her strange humility surprised him.\n\"You know without any words of mine----\"\n\n\"Is it that you really love Sir Thomas, or only that you find him\nuseful? Pardon me; I put not the question rudely. But all are so selfish\nin this England.\"\n\n\"I hope not. I think not,\" he answered very gently, having learned to\nallow for the petulance of grief. \"Your dear husband is not of that\nnature, Lady Waldron; and he does not suppose that his friends are so.\"\n\n\"No. It is true he makes the best of everybody. Even of that young Dr.\nFox, who is ill-treating him. That is the very thing I come to speak of.\nIf he had a good physician--but he is so resolute.\"\n\n\"But you will persuade him. It is a thing he owes to you. And in one\nlittle way I can help you perhaps a little. He fancies, I dare say, that\nto call in a man of larger experience would be unkind to Fox, and might\neven seem a sort of slur upon him. But I think I can get Fox himself to\npropose it, and even to insist upon it for his own sake. I believe that\nhe has been thinking of it.\"\n\n\"What is he, that his opinions should be consulted? He cannot see. But I\nsee things that agitate me--oh darker, darker--I cannot discover any\nconsolation anywhere. And my husband will not hear a word! It is\nso--this reason one day, and then some other, to excuse that he is not\nbetter; and his strong hands going, and his shoulders growing round, and\nhis great knees beginning to quiver, and his face--so what you call\ncheerful, lively, jolly, turning to whiter than mine, and blue with\ncups, and cords, and channels in it--oh, I will not have my husband\nlong; and where shall I be without him?\"\n\nAs she turned away her face, and waved her hand for the visitor to leave\nher, Mr. Penniloe discovered one more reason for doubting his own\njudgment.\n\n\"I will go and see him. He is always glad to see me;\" he said, as if\ntalking to himself alone. \"The hand of the Lord is over us, and His\nmercy is on the righteous.\"\n\nThe old soldier was not the man to stay indoors, or dwell upon his\nailments. As long as he had leg to move, or foot at all to carry him, no\neasy-chair or study-lounge held any temptation for him. The open air,\nand the breezy fields, or sunny breadth of garden full of ever-changing\nincident, the hill-top, or the river-side, were his delight, while his\nsteps were strong; and even now, whenever bodily pain relaxed.\n\nMr. Penniloe found him in his kitchen-garden, walking slowly, as behoves\na man of large frame and great stature, and leaning on a staff of\ntwisted Spanish oak, which had stood him in good stead, some five and\ntwenty years ago. Following every uncertain step, with her nose as close\nas if she had been a spur upon either boot, and yet escaping contact as\na dog alone can do, was his favourite little black spaniel _Jess_, as\nloving a creature as ever lived.\n\n\"What makes you look at me in that way, Jumps?\" the Colonel enquired,\nwhile shaking hands. \"I hope you are not setting up for a doctor too.\nOne is quite enough for the parish.\"\n\n\"Talking about doctors,\" replied the Parson, who thought it no scorn\nwhen his old schoolmate revived the nickname of early days (conferred\nperhaps by some young observer, in recognition of his springy\nstep)--\"talking about doctors, I think it very likely that my old friend\nGowler--you have heard me speak of him--will pay me a little visit,\nperhaps next week.\"\n\n\"Gowler? Was he at Peter's, after my time? It scarcely sounds like a\nWest country name. No, I remember now. It was at Oxford you fell in with\nhim.\"\n\n\"Yes. He got his Fellowship two years after I got mine. The cleverest\nman in the College, and one of the best scholars I ever met with. I was\nnowhere with him, though I read so much harder.\"\n\n\"Come now, Jumps--don't tell me that!\" Sir Thomas exclaimed, looking\ndown with admiration at the laureate of his boyhood; \"why, you knew\neverything as pat as butter, when you were no more than a hop o' my\nthumb! I remember arguing with Gus Browne, that it must be because you\nwere small enough to jump into the skulls of those old codgers, Homer,\nand Horace, and the rest of them. But how you must have grown since\nthen, my friend! I suppose they gave you more to eat at Oxford. But I\ndon't believe in any man alive being a finer scholar than you are.\"\n\n\"Gowler was, I tell you, Tom; and many, many others; as I soon\ndiscovered in the larger world. He had a much keener and deeper mind,\nfar more enquiring and penetrating, more subtle and logical, and\ncomprehensive, together with a smaller share perhaps of--of----\"\n\n\"Humility--that's the word you mean; although you don't like to say it.\"\n\n\"No, that is not what I mean exactly. What I mean is docility,\nductility, sequacity--if there is any such word. The acceptance of what\nhas been discovered, or at any rate acknowledged, by the highest human\nintellect. Gowler would be content with nothing, because it had\nsatisfied the highest human intellect. It must satisfy his own, or be\nrejected.\"\n\n\"I am very sorry for him,\" said Sir Thomas Waldron; \"such a man must be\ndrummed out of any useful regiment.\"\n\n\"Well, and he was drummed out of Oxford; or at any rate would follow no\ndrum there. He threw up his Fellowship, rather than take orders, and for\nsome years we heard nothing of him. But he was making his way in London,\nand winning reputation in minute anatomy. He became the first authority\nin what is called _histology_, a comparatively new branch of medical\nscience----\"\n\n\"Don't Phil, I beg of you. You make me creep. I think of Burke, and\nHare, and all those wretches. Fellows who disturb a man's last rest! I\nhave a deep respect for an honest wholesome surgeon; and wonderful\nthings I have seen them do. But the best of them are gone. It was the\nwar that made them; and, thank God, we have no occasion for such carvers\nnow.\"\n\n\"Come and sit down, Tom. You look--at least, I mean, I have been upon my\nlegs many hours to-day, and there is nothing like the jump in them of\nthirty years ago. Well, you are a kind man, the kindest of the kind, to\nallow your kitchen-gardeners such a comfortable bench.\"\n\n\"You know what I think,\" replied Sir Thomas, as he made believe to walk\nwith great steadiness and vigour, \"that we don't behave half well enough\nto those who do all the work for us. And I am quite sure that we Tories\nfeel it, ay and try to better it, ten times as much as all those\nspouting radical reformers do. Why, who is at the bottom of all these\nshocking riots, and rick-burnings? The man who puts iron, and boiling\nwater, to rob a poor fellow of his bread and bacon. You'll see none of\nthat on any land of mine. But if anything happens to me, who knows?\"\n\n\"My dear friend,\" Mr. Penniloe began, while the hand which he laid upon\nhis friend's was shaking, \"may I say a word to you, as an ancient chum?\nYou know that I would not intrude, I am sure.\"\n\n\"I am sure that you would not do anything which a gentleman would not\ndo, Phil.\"\n\n\"It is simply this--we are most anxious about you. You are not in good\nhealth, and you will not confess it. This is not at all fair to those\nwho love you. Courage, and carelessness about oneself, are very fine\nthings, but may be carried too far. In a case like yours they are\nsinful, Tom. Your life is of very great importance, and you have no\nright to neglect it. And can you not see that it is downright cruelty to\nyour wife and children, if you allow yourself to get worse and worse,\nwhile their anxiety increases, and you do nothing, and won't listen to\nadvice, and fling bottles of medicine into the bonfire? I saw one just\nnow, as we came down the walk--as full as when Fox put the cork in. Is\nthat even fair to a young practitioner?\"\n\n\"Well, I never thought of that. That's a new light altogether. You can\nsee well enough, it seems, when it is not wanted. But don't tell Jemmy,\nabout that bottle. Mind, you are upon your honour. But oh, Phil, if you\nonly knew the taste of that stuff! I give you my word----\"\n\n\"You shall not laugh it off. You may say what you like, but you know in\nyour heart that you are not acting kindly, or even fairly, by us. Would\nyou like your wife, or daughter, to feel seriously ill, and hide it as\nif it was no concern of yours? I put aside higher considerations, Tom I\nspeak to you simply as an old and true friend.\"\n\nIt was not the power of his words, so much as the trembling of his\nvoice, and the softness of his eyes, that vanquished the tough old\nsoldier.\n\n\"I don't want to make any fuss about it, Phil,\" Sir Thomas answered\nquietly; \"and I would rather have kept it to myself, a little longer.\nBut the simple truth is, that I am dying.\"\n\nThere was no sign of fear, or of sorrow, in his gaze; and he smiled very\ncheerfully while offering his hand, as if to be forgiven for the past\nconcealment. Mr. Penniloe could not speak, but fell back on the bench,\nand feared to look at him.\n\n\"My dear friend, I see that I was wrong to tell you,\" the sick man\ncontinued in a feebler tone; \"but you must have found it out very\nshortly; and I know that Jemmy Fox is well aware of it. But not a word,\nof course, to my wife or daughter, until--until it can't be helped. Poor\nthings--what a blow it will be to them! The thought of that makes me\nrebel sometimes. But it is in your power to help me greatly, to help me,\nas no other man on earth can do. It has long been in my thoughts, but I\nscarcely dared to ask you. Perhaps that was partly why I told you this.\nBut you are too good and kind, to call me selfish.\"\n\n\"Whatever it is, I will do it for you readily, if God gives me power,\nand ordains it so.\"\n\n\"Never make rash promises. What was it you used to construe to me in the\n_Delectus_? This is a long and a troublesome job, and will place you in\na delicate position. It is no less a trouble than to undertake, for a\ntime at least, the management of my affairs, and see to the interests of\nmy Nicie.\"\n\n\"But surely your wife--surely Lady Waldron--so resolute, ready, and\ncapable----\"\n\n\"Yes, she is all that, and a great deal more--honourable, upright, warm,\nand loving. She is not at all valued as she should be here, because she\ncannot come to like our country, or our people. But that would be no\nobstacle; the obstacle is this--she has a twin-brother, a certain Count\nde Varcas, whom she loves ardently, and I will not speak against him;\nbut he must have no chance of interfering here. My son Tom--_Rodrigo_\nhis mother calls him, after her beloved brother--is barely of age, as\nyou know, and sent off with his regiment to India; a very fine fellow in\nmany ways, but as for business--excuse me a moment, Phil; I will finish,\nwhen this is over.\"\n\nWith one broad hand upon the bench, he contrived to rise, and to steady\nhimself upon his staff, and stood for a little while thus, with his head\nthrown back, and his forehead like a block of stone. No groan from the\nchest, or contortion of the face, was allowed to show his agony; though\nevery drawn muscle, and wan hollow, told what he was enduring. And the\nblue scar of some ancient wound grew vivid upon his strong countenance,\nfrom the left cheek-bone to the corner of the mouth, with the pallid\ndamp on either side. Little _Jess_ came and watched him, with wistful\neyes, and a soft interrogative tremble of tail; while the clergyman rose\nto support him; but he would have no assistance.\n\n\"Thank God, it is over. I am all right now, for another three hours, I\ndare say. What a coward you must think me, Phil! I have been through a\ngood deal of pain, in my time. But this beats me, I must confess. The\nworst of it is, when it comes at night, to keep it from poor Isabel. Sit\ndown again now, and let me go on with my story.\"\n\n\"Not now, Tom. Not just yet, I implore you,\" cried the Parson, himself\nmore overcome than the sufferer of all that anguish. \"Wait till you find\nyourself a little stronger.\"\n\n\"No. That may never be. If you could only know the relief it will be to\nme. I have not a great mind. I cannot leave things to the Lord, except\nas concerns my own old self. Now that I have broken the matter to you, I\nmust go through with it. I cannot die, until my mind is easy about poor\nNicie. Her mother would be good to her, of course. But--well, Tom is her\nidol; and there is that blessed Count. Tom is very simple, just as I\nwas, at his age. I have many old friends; but all easy-going fellows,\nwho would leave everything to their lawyers--none at all to trust, like\nyou. And I know how fond you are of Nicie.\"\n\n\"To be sure I am. How could I help it? But remember that I am not at all\na man of business.\"\n\n\"What does that matter? You are very clear-headed, and prudent--at any\nrate for other people. And you will have Webber, a careful and clever\nSolicitor, to back you up. And mind, I am not asking you to supersede my\nwife, or take what should be her position. She is quite unacquainted\nwith English ways, she does not think as an Englishwoman would. She must\nhave an Englishman to act with her, in the trusts that will arise upon\nmy death; and when we were married in Spain, as you know, there was no\nchance of any marriage-settlement. In fact there was nothing to settle\nas yet, for I was not even heir to this property, until poor Jack was\nkilled at Quatrebras. And as for herself, all the family affairs were at\nsixes and sevens, as you may suppose, during the French occupation. Her\nfather had been a very wealthy man and the head of an ancient race,\nwhich claimed descent from the old Carthaginian Barcas, of whom you know\nmore than I do. But he had been too patriotic, and advanced immense sums\nto the State without security, and in other ways dipped his fine\nproperty, so that it would not recover for a generation. At any rate\nnothing came to her then, though she ought to have had a good sum\nafterwards. But whatever there may have been, her noble twin-brother\ntook good care that none of it came this way. And I was glad to get her\nwithout a _peseta_; and what is more, I have never repented of it; for a\nnobler and more affectionate woman never trod the earth.\"\n\nAs the sick man passed his hand before his eyes, in sad recollection of\nthe bygone bliss, Mr. Penniloe thought of his own dear wife--a far\nsweeter woman in his mild opinion; and, if less noble, none the worse\nfor that.\n\n\"But the point of it is this, Tom,\" the clergyman said firmly, for he\nbegan to feel already like a man of business, however sad and mournful\nthe business must become; \"does Lady Waldron consent to receive me,\nas--as co-trustee, or whatever it is called, if, if--which God\nforbid--it should ever prove to be necessary?\"\n\n\"My dear friend, I spoke to her about it yesterday, in such a way as not\nto cause anxiety or alarm: and she made no objection, but left\neverything to me. So you have only to agree; and all is settled.\"\n\n\"In that case, Tom,\" said Mr. Penniloe arising, and offering both hands\nto his friend, \"I will not shirk my duty to a man I love so much. May\nthe Lord be with me, for I am not a man of business--or at least, I have\nnot attained that reputation yet! But I will do my best, and your\nNicie's interests shall be as sacred to me, as my own child's. Is there\nanything you would like to say about her?\"\n\n\"Yes, Phil, one thing most important. She is a very loving girl; and I\ntrust that she will marry a good man, who will value her. I have\nfancied, more than once, that Jemmy Fox is very fond of her. He is a\nmanly straightforward fellow, and of a very good old family, quite equal\nto ours, so far as that goes. He has not much of this world's goods at\npresent; and her mother would naturally look higher. But when a man is\nin my condition, he takes truer views of life. If Jemmy loves her, and\nshe comes to love him, I believe that they would have a very happy life.\nHe is very cheerful, and of the sweetest temper--the first of all things\nin married life--and he is as upright as yourself. In a few years he\nwill be very well off. I could wish no better fortune for her--supposing\nthat she gives her heart to him.\"\n\n\"He is a great favourite of mine as well;\" the Curate replied, though\nsurprised not a little. \"But as I have agreed to all that you wish, Tom,\nyou must yield a little to my most earnest wish, and at the same time\ndischarge a simple duty. I cannot help hoping that your fears--or I will\nnot call them that, for you fear nothing--but your views of your own\ncase are all wrong. You must promise to take the highest medical\nopinion. If I bring Gowler over, with Fox's full approval, will you\nallow him to examine you?\"\n\n\"You are too bad, Phil. But you have caught me there. If you let me put\nyou into the hands of lawyers, it is tit for tat that you should drive\nme into those of doctors.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nDOCTORS THREE.\n\n\nPublic opinion at Perlycross was stirred, as with a many-bladed\negg-whisk, by the sudden arrival of Dr. Gowler. A man, who cared nothing\nabout the crops, and never touched bacon, or clotted cream, nor even\nreplied to the salutation of the largest farmer, but glided along with\nhis eyes on the ground, and a broad hat whelmed down upon his hairless\nwhite face; yet seemed to know every lane and footpath, as if he had\nbeen born among them--no wonder that in that unsettled time, when\nfrightful tales hung about the eaves of every cottage, and every\nleathern latch-thong was drawn inside at nightfall, very strange\nsuspicions were in the air about him. Even the friendship of the\nwell-beloved Parson, and the frank admiration of Dr. Fox, could not stem\nthe current against him. The children of the village ran away at his\nshadow, and the mothers in the doorway turned their babies' faces from\nhim.\n\nEvery one who loved Sir Thomas Waldron, and that meant everybody in the\nparish, shuddered at hearing that this strange man had paid two visits\nat Walderscourt, and had even remained there a great part of one night.\nAnd when it was known that the yearly cricket-match, between the north\nside of the Perle and the south, had been quenched by this doctor's\nstern decree, the wrath of the younger men was rebuked by the sorrow of\nthe elder. Jakes the schoolmaster, that veteran sergeant (known as \"High\nJarks,\" from the lofty flourish of his one remaining arm, and thus\ndistinct from his younger brother, \"Low Jarks,\" a good but not\nextraordinary butcher), firm as he was, and inured to fields of death,\nfound himself unable to refuse his iron cheeks the drop, that he was\nbetter fitted to produce on others.\n\nNow that brave descendant of Mars, and Minerva, feared one thing, and\none alone, in all this wicked world; and that was holy wedlock. It was\nrumoured that something had befallen him in Spain, or some other foreign\noutlands, of a nature to make a good Christian doubt whether woman was\nmeant as a helpmate for him, under the New Covenant. The Sergeant was\nnot given to much talking, but rigid, and resolute, and self-contained;\nmore apt to point, and be, the moral of his vast experience, than to\nadorn it with long tales. Many people said that having heard so much of\nthe roar of cannon and the roll of drums, he could never come to care\nagain for any toast-and-butter; while others believed that he felt it\nhis duty to maintain the stern silence, which he imposed in school.\n\nThere was however one person in the parish, with whom he indulged in\nbrief colloquy sometimes; and strange to say, that was a woman. Mrs.\nMuggridge, the Curate's housekeeper, felt more indignation than she\ncould express, if anybody whispered that she was fond of gossip. But\naccording to her own account, she smiled at such a charge, coming as it\nonly could from the lowest quarters, because she was bound for her\nmaster's sake, to have some acquaintance with her neighbours' doings;\nfor they found it too easy to impose on him. And too often little Fay\nwould run, with the best part of his dinner to some widow, mourning\ndeeply over an empty pot of beer. For that mighty police-force of\ncharity, the district-visitors, were not established then.\n\nThyatira, though not perhaps unduly nervous--for the times were sadly\nout of joint--was lacking to some extent in that very quality, which the\nSergeant possessed in such remarkable degree. And ever since that\nshocking day, when her dear mistress had been brought home from the\ncliff, stone-dead, the housekeeper had realised the perils of this life,\neven more deeply than its daily blessings. Susanna, the maid, was of a\nvery timid nature, and when piously rebuked for her want of faith in\nProvidence, had a knack of justifying her distrust by a course of very\ncreepy narratives. Mrs. Muggridge would sternly command her to leave\noff, and yet contrive to extract every horror, down to its dying\nwhisper.\n\nMoreover the rectory, a long and rambling house, was not a cheerful\nplace to sit alone in after dark. Although the high, and whitewashed,\nback abutted on the village street, there was no door there, and no\nwindow looking outwards in the basement; and the walls being very\nthick, you might almost as well be fifty miles from any company. Worst\nof all, and even cruel on the ancient builder's part, the only access to\nthe kitchen and the rooms adjoining it was through a narrow and dark\npassage, arched with rough flints set in mortar, which ran like a tunnel\nbeneath the first-floor rooms, from one end of the building to the\nother. The front of the house was on a higher level, facing southwards\nupon a grass-plat and flower-garden, and as pretty as the back was ugly.\n\nEven the stoutest heart in Perlycross might flutter a little in the\ngroping process, for the tunnel was pitch-dark at night, before emerging\ninto the candlelight twinkling in the paved yard beside the\nkitchen-door. While the servants themselves would have thought it a\ncrime, if the butcher, or baker, or anyone coming for them (except the\nPostman) had kept the front way up the open gravel walk, and ventured to\nknock at the front door itself. There was no bell outside to call them,\nand the green-baize door at the end of the passage, leading to the\nkitchen stairs, deadened the sound of the knocker so much, that\nsometimes a visitor might thunder away for a quarter of an hour, with\nintervals for conscientious study of his own temper, unless little Fay's\nquick ears were reached, and her pink little palms and chest began to\nstruggle with the mighty knob.\n\nSo it happened, one evening in the first week of August, when Mr.\nPenniloe was engaged in a distant part of the parish, somebody or other\ncame and knocked--it was never known how many times or how long,--at the\nupper-folk door of the rectory.\n\nThere was not any deafness about Thyatira; and as for Susanna, she could\nhear too much; neither was little Fay to blame, although the rest were\nrather fond of leaving things to her. If the pupils had returned, it\ncould not have happened so; for although they made quite enough noise of\ntheir own in the little back-parlour allotted to them, they never failed\nto hear any other person's noise, and to complain of it next morning,\nwhen they did not know their lessons.\n\nBut the present case was, that the whole live force of the rectory, now\non the premises, was established quite happily in the kitchen yard;\nwith a high wall between it and the village street, and a higher wall\ntopped with shrubs between it and the garden. Master Harry, now at home\nfor his holidays (a tiger by day, but a lion at night, for protection of\nthe household), was away with his father, and sleeping soundly through a\nBible-lecture. And so it came to pass that the tall dark man knocked,\nand knocked; and at last departed, muttering uncourteous expressions\nthrough his beard.\n\nEven that might never have been known inside, without the good offices\nof Mrs. Channing, the wife of the baker, whose premises adjoined the\nrectory garden, and the drive from the front gate.\n\n\"'Twas nort but them Gelany fowls,\" she explained, before she had her\nbreakfast, because her husband was the son of old Channing, the clerk,\nand sexton; \"them Gelany birds of ours, as drew my notice to it. They\nkept up such a screeching in the big linhay just at dusk, instead of\nsticking their heads inside their wings, that I thought they must be\nworriting about a dog, or cat. And so out of house I runs; but I\ncouldn't see nort, till I heers a girt knocking at Passon's front-door.\nThinks I--'What's up now?' For I knowed a' wurn't at home, but away to\nthey Bible-readings. So I claps the little barn-steps again your big\nwall, and takes the liberty of peeping over, just between the lalac bush\nand old holly. You must understand, Mrs. Muggridge, that the light\nwurn't very clear; but I could make out a big tall man a-standing, with\na long furrin cloak, atwixt the pillars of your porch.\n\n\"'Passon's not at home,' says I; 'can us give any message?'\n\n\"Then a' turns round sudden like, and stands just like a pictur', with\nthe postesses to either side of him, and his beard falling down the same\nas Aaron's. But if a' said ort, 'twaz beyond my comprehension.\n\n\"'Did you please to be looking for the Doctor, sir?' I said--'the Doctor\nas is biding now with Mr. Penniloe? I did hear that he was 'gone to\nSquire Waldron's house.' For I thought that he was more the sort to\nbelong to that old Gowler.\n\n\"But he only shook his head, and turned away; and presently, off he\nwalks most majestic, like the image of a man the same as I have seen to\nExeter. I felt myself in that alarm, that go away I couldn't, until I\nheard your gate fall to behind him. Then I thought to come and tell you,\nbut I hadn't got the nerves to face your black passage, after what had\ncome across me. For to my mind it must have been the Evil One himself.\nMay the Lord save us from his roarings and devourings!\"\n\nWhen Mrs. Muggridge heard this tale, she thought that it had better go\nno further, and she saw no occasion to repeat it to her master; because\nno message had been left, and he might imagine that she had not attended\nto her duty very well.\n\nFor it had chanced, that at the very moment when somebody wanted to\ndisturb them, the housekeeper was giving a most pleasant tea-party to\nthe two little dears, Master Michael, and Miss Fay.\n\nAnd by accident, of course, Sergeant Jakes had just dropped in. No black\npassage could be anything but a joke to a man of his valour; and no\nrapping at the door could have passed unchallenged, if it reached such\nears. But the hospitable Thyatira offered such a distraction of good\nthings, far beyond the largest larder-dreams of a dry-tongued lonely\nbachelor, that the coarser, and seldom desirable, gift of the ears lay\nin deep abeyance. For the Sergeant had felt quite enough of hardship to\nknow a good time, when he tasted it.\n\n\"Now, my precious little dears,\" Thyatira had whispered with a sigh,\nwhen the veteran would be helped no more; \"there is light enough still\nfor a game of hop-scotch, down at the bottom of the yard. Susanna will\nmark out the bed for you. You will find the chalk under the\nknife-board.\"\n\nAway ran the children; and their merry voices rang sweetly to the\ndancing of their golden hair.\n\n\"Sergeant Schoolmaster,\" continued the lady, for she knew that he liked\nthis combination of honours, \"how pleasant it is, when the shadows are\nfalling, to see the little innocents delighting in their games? It seems\nto be no more than yesterday, when I was as full of play as any of\nthem.\"\n\n\"A good many yesterdays have passed since that,\" Mr. Jakes thought as\nhe looked at her; but he was far too gallant and polite to say so. \"In\nyour case, ma'am, it is so,\" he replied: \"yesterday, only yesterday! The\nlast time I was here, I was saying to myself that you ladies have the\ncommand of time. You make it pass for us so quickly, while it is\nstanding still with you!\"\n\n\"What a fine thing it is to have been abroad! You do learn such things\nfrom the gift of tongues. But it do seem a pity you should have to say\nthem so much to yourself, Mr. Sergeant.\"\n\n\"Ma'am,\" replied the veteran, in some fear of becoming too\ncomplimentary; \"I take it that some of us are meant to live apart, and\nto work for the good of others. But have you heard how the Colonel is\nto-day? Ah, he is a man indeed!\"\n\n\"There are doctors enough to kill him now. And they are going to do it,\nthis very night.\" Mrs. Muggridge spoke rather sharply, for she was a\nlittle put out with her visitor.\n\n\"What?\" cried the man of sword and ferule. \"To operate, ma'am, and I not\nthere--I, who know all about operations!\"\n\n\"No, Mr. Sergeant; but to hold a council. And in this very house, I\nbelieve; the room is to be ready at ten o'clock. Dr. Fox, Dr. Gronow,\nand Dr. Gowler. It is more than I can understand. But not a word about\nit to any one. For Sir Thomas would be very angry. To frighten his\npeople, and make such a fuss--they durst not propose it at his own\nhouse. And Gronow has never been called in, as you know. But Dr. Jemmy\nmade a favour of it, for he thinks very highly of that man; and the\ngentleman from London did not object. Only he said that if it must be\nso, and everything was to be out of proper form, he would like my master\nto be present with them.\"\n\n\"Three doctors, and a parson to sit upon him! The Lord have mercy on the\nColonel's soul! There is no hope left for his poor body. I will tell\nyou, ma'am, what I saw once at Turry Vardoes--but no, it is not fit for\nyou to hear. Well, my heart is like a lump of lead. I would sooner have\nlost my other arm, than heard such a thing of the Colonel. Good night,\nma'am; and thanking you for all your kindness, I'm no fit company for\nany one, no longer.\"\n\nHe was gone in a moment. His many-angled form sank into the darkness of\nthe flinty tunnel, as swiftly as ever a schoolboy vanished, when that\nform became too conspicuous. Thyatira heaved a deep sigh, and sat down\nin the many-railed beechen chair at the head of her cruelly vacant\ntable. She began to count the empty dishes, and with less than her usual\ncharity mused upon the voracity of man. But her heart was kind, and the\ntear she wiped away was not wholly of selfish tincture.\n\n\"The hand of the Lord is upon us now. My master will lose the best\nfriend he has got,\" she was thinking, as the darkness gathered;\n\"faithful as he is, it will try him hard again; for Satan has prevailed\nagainst us. And this will be a worse snare than any he has laid. To have\nin Parsonage house a man, as chooseth not to come to prayers; or at any\nrate standeth up at mantel-piece, with his back turned on the kneelers;\ntill my master told him, like the Christian he is, that he would not\ndesire him, as his guest, to go contrairy to his principles,--and pretty\nprinciples they must be, I reckon,--but would beg him to walk in the\ngarden, rather than set such example to his household! Alas the day that\nsuch a man came here, to the house of a holy minister! No blessing can\never attend his medicine. Ah, the times are not as they was! No wonder\nthat Spring-heeled Jack is allowed to carry on, when such a heathen is\nencouraged in the land. It would not go out of my grains, if he was\nSpring-heeled Jack himself!\"\n\nMuch against her liking, and with a trembling hand, this excellent woman\nbrought in the candles, and prepared the sitting-room, for the\nconsultation of unholy science.\n\nBut the first to arrive was a favourite of hers, and indeed of all the\nparish, a young man of very cheerful aspect, and of brisk and ready\nspeech. No man had ever known Jemmy Fox despair of anything he\nundertook; and there were few things he would not undertake; only he\nmust tackle them in his own way. A square-built, thickset, resolute\nyoung fellow, of no great stature, but good frame and fibre, and as\nnimble as a pea in a frying-pan. There was nothing very wonderful about\nhis face; and at first sight a woman would have called him plain, for\nhis nose was too short, and his chin too square, and his mouth too wide\nfor elegance. But the more he was looked at, the better he was liked by\nany honest person; for he was never on the watch for fault in others, as\nhaters of humbug are too apt to be.\n\nAnd yet without intending, or knowing it at all, this son of Chiron had\ngiven deep offence to many of his brethren around Perlycross, and it\ntold upon him sadly afterwards. For he loved his Profession, and looked\nupon it as the highest and noblest in the world, and had worked at it\ntoo thoroughly not to have learned how often it is mere profession. By\nchoice he would have dropped all general practice, and become a surgeon\nonly; but this was impossible except in some large place, and cities\nwere not to his liking. As the only son of a wealthy banker he might\nhave led an idle life, if he pleased; but that he could not bear, and\nresolved to keep himself; for the old man was often too exacting, and\nthe younger had some little income of his own. Perlycross suited him\nwell, and he had taken a long and rambling house, which had formerly\nbeen a barn, about half a mile from the village.\n\n\"Seen anything of Spring-heeled Jack, the last night or two, Mrs.\nMuggridge?\" he enquired too lightly, as he flung down his hat in similar\nstyle at a corner. \"Have you heard the last thing that has come to light\nabout him?\"\n\n\"No, sir, no! But I hope it is no harm,\" replied the palpitating\nThyatira.\n\n\"Well, that depends upon how you take it. We have discovered for\ncertain, that he is a medical man from a country parish, not such a very\nlong way from here, who found his practice too small for the slaughter\non the wholesale style he delights in. And so he turned his instruments\ninto patent jumpers, tore the heart out of his last patient--he was\nobliged to choose a poor one, or it would have been too small--then he\nfitted a Bude-light to his biggest dark lantern. And you know better\nthan I do what he shows you at the window, exactly as the Church-clock\nstrikes twelve.\"\n\n\"Oh, Dr. Jemmy, how you do make one creep! Then after all he is not, as\neverybody says, even a dissolute nobleman?\"\n\n\"No. That is where the disappointment lies. He set that story afoot no\ndoubt, to comfort the relatives of the folk he kills. By the by, what a\nplace this old house would be for him! He likes a broad window-sill,\njust like yours, and the weather is the very thing for him.\"\n\n\"I shall nail up a green baize every night. Oh, Dr. Jemmy, there is a\nknock at the door! Would you mind seeing who it is--that's a dear?\"\n\nDr. Fox, with a pleasant smile, admitted Dr. Gronow, on his very first\nvisit to the rectory.\n\n\"Others not come yet?\" asked the elder gentleman, as the trembling\nhousekeeper offered him a chair; \"his Reverence would hardly like a pipe\nhere, I suppose. Well, Jemmy, what is your opinion of all this strange\naffair?\"\n\nMrs. Muggridge had hurried off, with a shiver and a prayer.\n\n\"I am mum, before my betters,\" the young man replied. \"The case is gone\nout of my hands altogether.\"\n\n\"And a good thing for you. I am glad of it for your sake. But we must\nnot anticipate Gowler. I have no business here, except as what the\nlawyers call _Amicus curi\u00c3\u00a6_. By the by, I suppose you have never seen\nthe smallest ground for suspicion of foul play?\"\n\n\"Never. I should have come to you first, if I had. There could be no\npossible motive, to begin with; and everybody loves him like a father.\"\n\n\"A man is too fatherly sometimes. One never can understand those foreign\nwomen. But you know the family, and I do not. Excuse me for a horrible\nsuggestion. But I have had some very dark experiences.\"\n\n\"And so, no doubt, has Gowler. The idea crossed his brain; but was\nscattered immediately, when he knew the facts. Hush, here they come! Let\nus think no more of that.\"\n\nMr. Penniloe was tired, and in very low spirits; for he looked upon this\nmeeting as the fatal crisis. After seeing to his visitors, and offering\nrefreshment--which none of them accepted--he took a chair apart, being\npresent as a listener only.\n\nThereupon Dr. Gowler in very few words gave his view of the case,\npremising only that he spoke with some doubt, and might well be\nmistaken, for the symptoms were perplexing, and the malady was one which\nhad not as yet been studied at all exhaustively. His conclusion agreed\nin the main with that of his young and sagacious coadjutor, though he\nwas enabled, by longer experience, to be perhaps a little more definite.\nHe spoke very well, and with a diffidence which particularly impressed\nthe others, on the part of a man whose judgment was of the very highest\nauthority.\n\nDr. Gronow immediately confirmed his view, so far as the details at\nsecond hand could warrant, and gave his own account of a similar case,\nwhere the injury was caused by the handle of a barrow, and continued\nlatent for several years. The unanimous decision was that no hope\nremained; unless the poor patient would submit to a surgical operation\nof great difficulty and danger, in the then condition of medical\nscience; and for which it was advisable to have recourse to Paris.\n\n\"I know him too well. He will never consent,\" Mr. Penniloe came forward,\nand sought from face to face for some gleam of encouragement; \"surely\nthere must be some other course, something at least to alleviate----\"\n\n\"There may be: but we do not know it yet, and I fear that we never shall\ndo so. And for this very sufficient reason\"--here Dr. Gowler took a\nglove from his pocket, and presented a most simple and convincing\nexplanation of the mischief that had happened, and the consequence that\nmust of necessity ensue, without surgical redress. Even that he admitted\nwas of very doubtful issue, in plain English--\"either kill, or cure.\"\n\nThe Parson sighed heavily, and even Dr. Fox was too much affected to say\na word; but the elder physicians seemed to think it right and natural,\nand a credit to their science, that they knew so much about it. Gowler\nand Gronow were becoming mighty friends--so far as two men of the world\ncare to indulge--and the great London doctor accepted with pleasure the\noffer of a day's fly-fishing.\n\n\"I have not thrown a fly, since I was quite a boy,\" he said.\n\n\"And I never threw a fly, till I was an old man,\" said the other; and\ntheir host knew well which would have the better chance, though he felt\na little vexed at their light arrangements.\n\n\"It is not for the sake of the fishing, my dear fellow,\" Dr. Gowler\nassured him, when the other two were gone; \"I was to have left you in\nthe morning, as you know; and I have not had such a holiday for seven\nyears. I positively needed it, and shall be twice the man. But I felt\nthat I ought to stay one day longer, to give you one more chance of\npersuading poor Sir Thomas. See how handsomely he has behaved--I mean,\naccording to country notions; though I often make more in one day, in\nTown. He slipped this into my hand, sealed up; and I did not refuse it,\nfor fear of a fuss. But you will return it, when I am in the coach, and\nexplain, with my kind regards, that it is against my rule to take any\nfee, upon a visit to a friend. I came to renew our old friendship only,\nand from my great regard for you. We do not think alike, upon the\ngreatest of all matters. Perhaps that is better for your happiness than\nmine. But after all my knowledge of the world, I do believe that the\nbest friends are those, who are like you.\"\n\nMr. Penniloe took the cheque for fifty guineas, and placed it in his\ndesk, without a word; for he knew his friend's character too well to\nargue. Then he shook him very warmly by the hand, and said \"Good night.\"\n\nBut as he sank back in his chair to reflect, and examine himself of the\nbygone day, he hoped that his ears had deceived him that night, in a\nmatter which had shocked him sadly. Unless they had erred, Dr. Gronow\nhad said--\"In a case of this kind, for the advance of knowledge, autopsy\nshould be compulsory.\" And Harrison Gowler had replied--\"Exactly so; but\nin this benighted part, I suppose it is impossible.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nR. I. P.\n\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Sergeant, how you did alarm me!\" cried a very pretty damsel one\nfine October evening, as she almost fell upon the breast of \"High\nJarks,\" from some narrow stone steps at the corner of a lane. She was\ncoming by the nearest way to the upper village, from the side-entrance\nto Walderscourt, a picturesque way but a rough one. For the lane was\noverhung, and even overwhelmed, with every kind of hindrance to the\nproper course of trade. Out of the sides, and especially at corners,\nwhere the right of way should have been most sacred, jutted forth\nobstacles most inconsiderate, or even of set purpose, malicious. If a\ngreat stool of fern could be treated as nothing, even with its jagged\nsaws quivering, or a flexible ash could be shoved aside lightly, with\nthe cowardly knowledge that it had no thorns; yet in ambush with their\nspears couched, would be the files of furze, the barbed brigade of\nholly, or the stiff picket of blackthorn. And any man, engaged with\nthese deliveries of the moment, might thank his stars (when visible\nthrough the tangle overhead) if by any chance he missed a blinding thump\nin both his eyes.\n\nAlas, it would have been indeed a blessing, as well as a just\ncorrection, for the well-seasoned master of the youth of Perlycross, if\na benevolent switch from the hedgerow had taken him sharply in the eyes,\nthat had so long descried nothing but motes in more tender orbs. As the\nyoung maid drew back from the warlike arm, which had been quite obliged\nto encircle her, one flash of her eyes entered those of Mr. Jakes; and\nhe never saw again as he had seen before.\n\nBut his usual composure was not gone yet. A true schoolmaster is well\nassured, whatever the circumstance may be, that he is in the right, and\nall others in the wrong.\n\n\"I beg you will offer no apologies, Miss,\" he began with a very gracious\nsmile, as he rubbed up the nap of his old velvet coat where a wicked boy\nhad tallow-candled it: \"I take it that you are a stranger here, and not\nquite familiar with our kind of road. The roads about here have a manner\nof showing that they know not in what direction they are going?\"\n\n\"But, Mr. Sergeant, don't you know me? Not so very long ago, I ran up\nthis very lane, over the plank-bridge, and up to this heling, because of\nthe temper you were in. It was my brother Watty you wanted to catch: but\nyou flourished your cane so, that the girls ran too. But you would not\nhave beaten poor me, Mr. Sergeant?\"\n\nShe skipped back a step or two, as if still afraid, and curtsied to show\nher pretty figure, and managed to let her bright hair fall down over the\nblush of her soft round cheeks. Then she lifted her eyes with the\nsweetest appeal; for the fair Tamar Haddon was a born coquette.\n\n\"Why, Tamar, my dear, can it possibly be you? I could never have\nsupposed that you would come to this. You were always the prettiest\nchild among the girls. But, as you know, I had nothing to do with them.\nMy business has always been with the boys.\"\n\n\"And quite right, Mr. Sergeant--they are so much better, so much quicker\nto learn, as well as better-looking, and more interesting!\"\n\n\"That depends upon who it may be,\" said Mr. Jakes judicially; \"some\ngirls are much better at round-hand, as well as arithmetic. But why have\nI lost sight of you all these years? And why have you grown such\na--well, such a size?\"\n\n\"Oh, you _are_ rude! I am not a size at all. I thought that you always\nlearned politeness in the wars. I am only seventeen round the waist--but\nyou shan't see. No, no, stick you to the boys, Mr. Sergeant. I must be\noff. I didn't come out for pleasure. Good evening, sir; good evening to\nyou!\"\n\n\"Don't be in such a hurry, Miss Haddon. Don't you know when I used to\ngive you sugar-plums out of this horn box? And if I may say it without\noffence, you are much too pretty to be in this dark place, without\nsomebody to take care of you.\"\n\n\"Ah, now you are more like the Army again. There is nothing like a\nwarrior, in my opinion. Oh, what a plague these brambles are! Would you\nmind just holding my hat for a moment? I mustn't go into the village,\nsuch a fright, or everybody will stare at me. My hair is such a trouble,\nI have half a mind sometimes to cut off every snip of it. No, no, you\ncan't help me; men are much too clumsy.\"\n\nMr. Jakes was lost in deep admiration, and Tamar Haddon knew it well,\nand turned away to smile, as she sat upon a bank of moss, drawing her\nlong tresses through the supple play of fingers and the rosy curve of\npalms; while her cherry lips were pouting and her brown eyes sparkling,\nin and out the golden shower from her saucy forehead. The schoolmaster\nheld her little hat, and watched every movement of her hands and eyes,\nand wondered; for the gaiety of girlhood, and the blushes and the\nglances were as the opening of a new world to him.\n\n\"I know what you are thinking now, it's no good to deny it,\" she cried\nas she jumped up, and snatched her hat away; \"you are saying to\nyourself--'What a poor vain creature! Servants' hats are not allowed in\nwell-conducted households.' But you must understand that I am not a\ncommon servant. I am a private lady's-maid to her ladyship, the\nCountess; and she has none of your old-fashioned English ways about her.\nShe likes to see me look--well, perhaps you would not call it 'pretty,'\nfor that depends upon the wearer, and I have no pretension to it--but\ntidy, and decent, and tolerably nice----\"\n\n\"Wonderfully nice, and as lovely as a rose.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Sergeant, you who must know so much better! But I have no time\nfor such compliments, and they would turn my little head, from such a\nlearned man as you are. How can I think of myself for a moment, when\nthings are so dreadful? Poor Sir Thomas--you know how ill he is; he is\nlonging for something, and I am sent to fetch it on the sly, so that Dr.\nFox should have no idea, but her ladyship says that it can do no harm,\nnow.\"\n\n\"What, the poor Colonel waiting, Miss, and I have kept you all this\ntime? I was just on my way to enquire for him, when--when I happened to\nmeet you. I can scarcely believe in any doctor conquering him.\"\n\n\"They are though--they are doing it. He is very low to-day. They seem to\nhave brought him down to a flat knock-under, just as you do with the\nschoolboys. I can't hardly think of it, without crying.\"\n\nThe fair Tamar dropped her eyes, and hung her head a little, and then\nlooked softly at the veteran, to plead for his warmest sympathy.\n\n\"There, I declare to you, I have cried so much that I can't cry no\nmore,\" she continued with a sigh; \"but it is a calf's sweetbread that I\nbe bound to get; and where from, I'd like to know, unless it is to Mr.\nRobert's.\"\n\nA pang shot through the heart of Mr. Jakes, and if his cane had been at\nhand he would have grasped it. For Mr. Robert was his own brother, the\nonly butcher in the village, a man of festive nature (as a butcher ought\nto be), of no habitual dignity--and therefore known as \"Low Jarks\"--a\nfavourite with the fair sex, and worst of all, some twenty years the\njunior of \"High Jarks.\"\n\n\"What, young Bobby!\" cried the Sergeant, striking out, \"there is nothing\nthat he knows worth speaking of. And what is more to the purpose, he\nnever will know nothing. I mean to say 'anything.' Sometimes I go back\nfrom all my instructions all over the world, to the way--to the way you\ntalk, in this part of the world.\"\n\n\"But, Mr. Sergeant, that is only natural; considering that you belong to\nthis part of the world. Now, you do--don't you? However learned you may\nbe.\"\n\n\"Well, I will not deny that it comes up sometimes. A man of my years--I\nmean, a young man by age, and yet one who has partaken in great motions,\nfeels himself so very much above butchers' shops, and the like of them.\nAnd all the women--or as they call themselves now--all the ladies of the\nneighbourhood, have now been so well educated, that they think a great\ndeal of the difference.\"\n\n\"To be sure,\" said Tamar Haddon, \"I can quite see that. But how could\nthey get their meat, without the butchers' shops? Some people are too\nlearned, Mr. Sergeant.\"\n\n\"I know it, Miss. But I am very particular, not to let any one say it of\nme. I could quote Latin, if I chose: but who would put a spill to my\npipe afterwards? One must never indulge in all one knows.\"\n\n\"Well, it does seem a pity, after spending years about it. But here we\nare, come to the river-side at last. You mustn't think of coming across\nthe plank with me. It would never do to have you drownded; and you know\nwhat Betty Cork is. Why, all the boys to Perlycross would be making\nmouths to-morrow? And I shall go home along the turnpike-road.\"\n\nThe schoolmaster saw the discretion of this. Charmed as he was with this\ngay young maid, he must never forget what was thought of him.\n\nFor she was the daughter of Walter Haddon, the landlord of the\n_Ivy-bush_, a highly respectable place, and therefore jealous of the\nparish reputation. Moreover the handrail of the footbridge was now on\nthe side of his empty sleeve; and the plank being very light and\ntremulous, he feared to recross it without stepping backward, which was\nbetter done without spectators. So he stayed where he was, while she\ntripped across, without even touching the handrail; and the dark gleam\nof the limpid Perle, in the twilight of gray branches, fluttered with\nher passing shadow.\n\nJust as she turned on the opposite bank, where cart-ruts ridged the\nwater's brink, and was kissing her hand to the ancient soldier, with a\ngay \"Good evening!\"--the deep boom of a big bell rang, and quivered\nthroughout the valley. Cattle in the meadows ceased from browsing, and\nlooked up as if they were called, birds made wing for the distant wood,\nand sere leaves in the stillness rustled, as the solemn thrill trembled\nin the darkening air.\n\n\"For God's sake, count,\" the old soldier cried, raising the hat from his\ngrizzled head, and mounting a hillock clear of bushes; \"it is the big\nbell tolling!\"\n\nBut the frolicsome maiden had disappeared, and he was left to count\nalone.\n\nAt intervals of a minute, while the fall of night grew heavier, the\nburden of the passing-bell was laid on mortal ears and hearts.\n\n\n     \"Time is over for one more,\"\n\n\nwas graven on the front of it, and was borne along the valley; while the\necho of the hills brought home the lesson of the reverse--\n\n\n     \"Soon shall thy own life be o'er.\"\n\n\nKeeping throbbing count, the listener spread the fingers of his one\nhand upon his threadbare waistcoat; and they trembled more and more, as\nthe number grew towards the fatal forty-nine. When the forty-ninth\nstroke ceased to ring, and the last pulsation died away, he stood as if\nhis own life depended on the number fifty. But the knell was finished;\nthe years it told of were but forty-nine--gone by, like the minutes\nbetween the strokes.\n\n\"Old Channing perhaps is looking at the tower-clock. Hark! In a moment,\nhe will strike another stroke.\" But old Channing knew his arithmetic too\nwell.\n\n\"Now God forgive me for a sinful man--or worse than a man, an ungrateful\nbeast!\" cried the Sergeant, falling upon his knees, with sorrow\nembittered by the shameful thought, that while his old chief was at the\nlatest gasp, himself had been flirting merrily with a handmaid of the\nhouse, and sniggering like a raw recruit. He wiped his eyes with the\nback of his hand, and the lesson of the bell fell on him.\n\nIt had fallen at the same time upon ears more heedful, and less needful\nof it. Mr. Penniloe, on his homeward road, received the mournful\nmessage, and met the groom who had ridden so hard to save the angelical\nhour. And truly, if there be any value in the ancient saying--\n\n\n     \"Happy is the soul\n     That hath a speedy toll,\"\n\n\nthe flight of Sir Thomas Waldron's spirit was in the right direction.\n\nThe clergyman turned from his homeward path, and hastened to the house\nof mourning. He scarcely expected that any one as yet would care to come\ndown, or speak to him; but the least he could do was to offer his help.\nIn the hush of the dusk, he was shown through the hall, and into a\nlittle sitting-room favoured by the ladies. Believing that he was quite\nalone, for no one moved, and the light was nearly spent, he took a seat\nby the curtained window, and sank into a train of sombre thoughts. But\npresently a lapping sound aroused him, and going to the sofa, there he\nfound his favourite Nicie overcome with sorrow, her head drooping back,\nlike a wind-tossed flower; while _Pixie_, with a piteous gaze, was\nnestling to her side, and offering every now and then the silent comfort\nof his tongue.\n\n\"What is it, my dear?\" The Parson asked, as if he did not know too well.\nBut who knows what to say sometimes? Then, shocked at himself, he\nsaid--\"Don't, my dear.\" But she went on sobbing, as if he had not\nspoken; and he thought of his little Fay, when she lost her mother.\n\nHe was too kind to try any consolations, or press the sense of duty yet;\nbut he put on his glasses, and took little _Pixie_, and began to stroke\nhis wrinkled brow.\n\n\"This dear little thing is crying too,\" he whispered; and certainly\nthere were tears, his own or another's, on the velvet nose. Then Nicie\nrose slowly, and put back her hair, and tried to look bravely at both of\nthem.\n\n\"If mother could only cry,\" she said; \"but she has not moved once, and\nshe will not come away. There is one thing she ought to do, but she\ncannot; and I am afraid that I should never do it right. Oh, will you do\nit, Uncle Penniloe? It would be an excuse to get her out of the room;\nand then we might make her lie down, and be better. My father is gone;\nand will mother go too?\"\n\nSpeaking as steadily as she could, but breaking down every now and then,\nshe told him, that there was a certain old ring, of no great value, but\nvery curious, which her father had said many years ago he would like to\nhave buried with him. He seemed to have forgotten it, throughout his\nlong illness; but his wife had remembered it suddenly, and had told them\nwhere to find it. It was found by a trusty servant now; and she was\npresent, while Mr. Penniloe placed it on the icy finger, and dropped a\ntear on the forehead of his friend, holy now in the last repose.\n\nOn his homeward path that night, the Curate saw through the gloom of\nlonely sorrow many a storm impending. Who was there now to hold the\nparish in the bonds of amity, to reconcile the farmers' feuds, to help\nthe struggling tradesman, to bury the aged cripple, to do any of those\ncountless deeds of good-will and humanity, which are less than the\ndiscount of the interest of the debt, due from the wealthy to the poor?\n\nAnd who would cheer him now with bold decision, and kind deference, in\nall those difficulties which beset the country clergyman, who hates to\nstrain his duty, yet is fearful of relaxing it? Such difficulties must\narise; and though there certainly was in those days, a great deal more\nfair give-and-take than can be now expected, there was less of settled\nrule and guidance for a peaceful parson. Moreover, he felt the important\ncharge which he had undertaken, as co-trustee of large estates, as well\nas a nervous dread of being involved in heavy outlay, with no rich\nfriend to back him now, concerning the repairs, and in some measure the\nrebuilding, of the large and noble parish church.\n\nBut all these personal troubles vanished, in the memories of true\nfriendship, and in holy confidence, when he performed that last sad duty\nin the dismantled church, and then in the eastern nook of the long\ngraveyard. He had dreaded this trial not a little, but knew what his\ndear friend would have wished; and the needful strength was given him.\n\nIt has been said, and is true too often (through our present usages)\nthat one funeral makes many. A strong east wind of unwonted bitterness\nat this time of year--it was now the last day of October--whistled\nthrough the crowd of mourners, fluttered scarf, and crape, and veil, and\nset old Channing's last tooth raging, and tossed the minister's\nwhitening locks, and the leaves of the Office for the Dead. So cold was\nthe air, that people of real pity and good feeling, if they had no\nfriends in the village, hied to the _Ivy-bush_, when all was over, and\ncalled for hot brandy and water.\n\nBut among them was not Mr. Jakes, though he needed a stimulus as much as\nany. He lingered in the churchyard, till the banking up was done, and\nevery one else had quitted it. When all alone, he scooped a hole at the\nhead of the grave, and filled it with a bunch of white chrysanthemums,\nimbedded firmly to defy the wind. Then he returned to the sombre\nschool-room, at the west end of the churchyard, and with one window\nlooking into it. There, although he had flint and tinder, he did not\neven light a dip, but sat for hours in his chair of office, with his\nhead laid on the old oak desk. Rough, and sad, and tumbled memories\npassed before his gray-thatched eyes, and stirred the recesses of his\nrugged heart.\n\nSuddenly a shadow fell across his desk. He rose from his dream of the\npast, and turning saw the half-moon quivering aslant, through the\ndiamond panes of the lattice. For a minute he listened, but there was\nnothing to be heard, except a long low melancholy wail. Then he buttoned\nhis coat, his best Sunday black, and was ashamed to find the empty cuff\nwet, as the bib of an infant, but with the tears of motherless old age.\n\nAfter his manner--when no boys were nigh--he condemned himself for an\nancient fool, and was about to strike a light, when the sad low sound\nfell again upon his ears. Determined to know what the meaning of it was,\nhe groped for his hat, and stout oak staff, and entered the churchyard\nby the little iron gate, the private way from the school premises.\n\nThe silence was as deep as the stillness of the dead; but, by the light\nof the westering moon, he made his way among the white tombstones, and\nthe rubbish of the builders, to the eastern corner where Sir Thomas\nWaldron lay. His old chief's grave was fair and smooth, and the crisp\nearth glistened in the moonlight, for the wind had fallen, and a frost\nwas setting in; but a small black figure lay on the crown, close to the\nbunch of flowers. A low growl met him; and then a dismal wail of\nanguish, beyond any power of words or tears, trembled along the wan\nalleys of the dead, and lingered in the shadowy recesses of the church.\n\n\"Good little _Jess_, thou art truer than mankind,\" said the Sergeant,\nand marched away to his lonely bed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nTHE POTATO-FIELD.\n\n\nLive who may, and die who must, the work of the world shall be carried\non. Of all these works, the one that can never be long in arrears is\neating; and of all British victuals, next to bread, the potato claims\nperhaps the foremost place. Where the soil is light towards Hagdon Hill,\non the property of the Dean and Chapter, potatoes, meet for any\ndignitary of the Church, could be dug by the ton, in those days. In\nthese democratic and epidemic times, it is hard to find a good potato;\nand the reason is too near to seek. The finer the quality of fruit or\nroot, the fiercer are they that fall on it; and the nemesis of\nexcellence already was impending. But the fatal blow had not fallen yet;\nthe ripe leaves strewed the earth with vivid gold, instead of reeking\nweltering smut; and the berries were sound, for boys and girls to pelt\none another across the field; while at the lift of the glistening fork\nacross the crumbling ridges, up sprang a cluster of rosy globes, clean\nas a codlin, and chubby as a cherub.\n\nFarmer John Horner, the senior Churchwarden, and the largest ratepayer\non the south side of the Perle, would never have got on as he did,\nwithout some knowledge of the weather. The bitter east wind of the\nprevious night, and the keen frost of the morning, had made up his mind\nthat it was high time to lift his best field of potatoes. He had two\nlarge butts to receive the filled sacks--assorted into ware and\nchats--and every working man on the farm, as well as his wife and\nchildren, had been ordered to stick at this job, and clear this\nfour-acre field before nightfall. The field was a good step from the\nvillage, as well as from Farmer Horner's house; and the lower end (where\nthe gate was) abutted on the Susscot lane, leading from the ford to\nPerlycross.\n\nIt was now All-Hallows day, accounted generally the farewell of autumn,\nand arrival of the winter. Birds, and beasts, that know their time\nwithout recourse to calendar, had made the best use of that knowledge,\nand followed suit of wisdom. Some from the hills were seeking\ndownwards, not to abide in earnest yet, but to see for themselves what\nmen had done for their comfort when the pinch should come; some of more\ntender kind were gone with a whistle at the storms they left behind; and\nothers had taken their winter apparel, and meant to hold fast to the\nhomes they understood.\n\nFarmer John, who was getting rather short of breath from the fatness of\nhis bacon, stirred about steadfastly among the rows, exhorting,\nordering, now and then upbraiding, when a digger stuck his fork into the\nfinest of the clump. He had put his hunting gaiters on, because the\nground would clog as soon as the rime began to melt; and the fog, which\nstill lingered in the hollows of the slopes, made him pull his triple\nchin out of his comforter to cough, as often as he opened his big mouth\nto scold. For he was not (like farmers of the present day) too thankful\nfor anything that can be called a crop, to utter a cross word over it.\n\nOld Mr. Channing, the clerk, came in by the gate from the lane, when the\nsun was getting high. Not that he meant to do much work--for anything\nbut graves, his digging time was past, and it suited him better to make\nbreeches--but simply that he liked to know how things were going on, and\nthought it not impossible that if he praised the 'taturs, Churchwarden\nmight say--\"Bob, you shall taste them; we'll drop you a bushel, when the\nbutt comes by your door.\" So he took up a root or two here and there,\nand \"hefted it,\" (that is to say, poised it carefully to judge the\nweight, as one does a letter for the post) and then stroked the sleek\nskin lovingly, and put it down gingerly for fear of any bruise. Farmer\nJohn watched him, with a dry little grin; for he knew what the old\ngentleman was up to.\n\n\"Never see'd such 'taturs in all my life,\" Mr. Channing declared with a\nsigh of admiration. \"Talk of varmers! There be nobody fit to hold a\ncan'le to our Measter John. I reckon them would fry even better than\nthey biled; and that's where to judge of a 'tatur, I contends.\"\n\n\"Holloa, Mr. Clerk! How be you then, this fine morning?\" The farmer\nshouted out, as if no muttering would do for him, while he straddled\nover a two-foot ridge, with the rime thawing down his gaiters. \"Glad to\nsee 'e here, old veller. What difference do 'e reckon now, betwixt a man\nand a 'tatur?\"\n\nFarmer John was famous for his riddles. He made them all himself, in\nconversation with his wife--for he had not married early--and there was\nno man in the parish yet with brains enough to solve them. And if any\none attempted it, the farmer always snubbed him.\n\n\"There now, ye be too deep for me!\" Mr. Channing made a hole in the\nground with his stick, as if Mr. Horner was at the bottom of it. \"It\nrequireth a good deal more than us have got, to get underneath your\nmeaning, sir.\"\n\n\"No, Bob, no! It be very zimple, and zuitable too for your trade. A\n'tatur cometh out of ground, when a' be ripe; but a man the zame way\ngoeth underground. And a good thing for him, if he 'bideth there,\naccording to what hath been done in these here parts, or a little way up\ncountry. No call for thee to laugh, Bob, at thy time of life, when\nbehooveth thee to think over it. But I'll give thee an order for a pair\nof corduroys, and thou shalt have a few 'taturs, when the butt comes by.\nUs, as belongs to the Church, is bound to keep her agoing, when the hogs\nwon't miss it! But there, Lord now, I want a score of nose-rings? Have\n'e see'd anything of Joe Crang, this morning? We never heer'd nort of\nhis anvil all the time! Reckon Joe had a drop too much at the _Bush_,\nlast night.\"\n\n\"Why, here a' coom'th!\" exclaimed the clerk. \"Look, a' be claimbin' of\nan open gate! Whatever can possess the man? A' couldn't look more mazed\nand weist, if a hunderd ghostesses was after him?\"\n\nJoseph Crang, the blacksmith at Susscot ford, where the Susscot brook\npassed on its way to the Perle, was by nature of a merry turn, and\nshowed it in his face. But he had no red now, nor even any black about\nhim, and the resolute aspect, with which he shod a horse, or swung a big\nhammer, was changed into a quivering ghastly stare; his lips were of an\nashy blue, like a ring of tobacco smoke; and as for his body, and legs,\nand clothes, they seemed to have nothing to do with one another.\n\n\"What aileth the man?\" cried Mr. Channing, standing across, as he had\nthe right to do, after bestraddling so many burials; \"Master Joe Crang,\nI call upon thee to collect thy wits, and out with it.\"\n\n\"Joe, thy biggest customer hath a right to know thy meaning.\" Farmer\nJohn had been expecting to have to run away; but was put in courage by\nthe clerk, and brought up his heels in a line with the old man's.\n\n\"Coompany, coompany is all I axes for,\" the blacksmith gasped weakly, as\nif talking to himself--\"coompany of living volk, as rightly is alive.\"\n\n\"Us be all alive, old chap. But how can us tell as you be?\" The clerk\nwas a seasoned man of fourscore years, and knew all the tricks of\nmortality.\n\n\"I wish I wadn't. A'most I wish I wadn't, after all I zee'd last night.\nBut veel of me, veel of me, Measter Channin', if you plaise to veel of\nme.\"\n\n\"Tull 'e what,\" the Churchwarden interposed; \"gie 'un a drink of zider,\nBob. If a' be Joe Crang, a' won't say no to thiccy. There be my own\nlittle zup over by the hedge, Joe.\"\n\nWithout any scruple the blacksmith afforded this proof of vitality. The\ncider was of the finest strain--\"three stang three,\" as they called\nit--and Joe looked almost like himself, as he put down the little wooden\nkeg, with a deep sigh of comfort.\n\n\"Maketh one veel like a man again,\" he exclaimed, as he flapped himself\non the chest. \"Master Hornder, I owe 'e a good turn for this. Lord only\nknoweth where I maight a' been, after a' visited me zo last night. It\nwas a visit of the wicked one, by kitums.\" Master Crang hitched up his\ntrousers, and seemed ready to be off again. But the Churchwarden gripped\nhim by the collar.\n\n\"Nay, man. Shan't have it thy own way. After what us have doed for thy\nthroat, us have a call upon thy breath. Strange ways with strangers;\nopen breast with bellyful.\"\n\nThe honest blacksmith stood in doubt, and some of his terror crept back\nagain. \"Bain't for me to zettle. Be a job for Passon Penniloe. Swore\nupon my knees I did. Here be the mark on my small-clothes. Passon is the\nonly man can set my soul to liberty.\"\n\n\"What odds to us about thy soul? 'Tis thy tongue we want, lad?\" the\nsenior Churchwarden cried impatiently. \"Thou shalt never see a groat of\nmine again, unless thou speakest.\"\n\n\"Passon hath a chill in's bones, and the doctor hath been called to\nhim,\" Mr. Channing added, with a look of upper wisdom. \"Clerk and\nChurchwarden, in council assembled, hath all the godliness of a rubric.\"\n\nThe blacksmith was moved, and began to scratch his head. \"If a' could\nonly see it so?\" he muttered--\"howsomever, horder they women vessels out\no' zight. A woman hath no need to hear, if her can zee--according as the\nwise man sayeth. And come where us can see the sun a shinin'; for my\nwords will make 'e shiver, if ye both was tombstones. I feel myself a\nbusting to be rid of them.\"\n\nMaster Crang's tale--with his speech fetched up to the manner of the\neast of England, and his flinty words broken into our road-metal--may\nfairly be taken for spoken as follows:--\n\n\"No longer agone than last night, I tell you, I went to bed, pretty much\nas usual, with nothing to dwell upon in my mind; without it was poor\nSquire's funeral, because I had been attending of it. I stayed pretty\nnearly to the last of that, and saw the ground going in again; and then\nI just looked in at the _Bush_, because my heart was downsome. All the\ncompany was lonesome, and the room was like a barn after a bad cold\nharvest, with a musty nose to it. There was nobody with spirit to stand\nglasses round, and nobody with heart to call for them. The Squire was\nthat friendly-minded, that all of us were thinking--'The Lord always\ntaketh the best of us. I may be the one to be called for next.' Then an\nold man in the corner, who could scarcely hold his pipe, began in a low\nvoice about burials, and doctors, and the way they strip the graves up\nthe country; and the others fell in about their experience; and with\nonly two candles and no snuffers but the tongs, any one might take us\nfor a company of sextons.\n\n\"The night was cruel cold, when I come out, and everything looking weist\nand unkid, and the big bear was right across the jags of church-tower;\nand with nothing inside to keep me up to the mark, and no neighbour\nmaking company, the sound of my own heels was forced upon my ears, as\nyou might say, by reason of the gloomy road, and a spark of flint\nsometimes coming up like steel-filings, when I ran to keep heat, for I\nhad not so much as a stick with me. And when I got home I roused up the\nforge-fire, so as to make sure where I was, and comfort my knuckles; and\nthen I brashed it down, with coals at present figure, for the morning.\n\n\"As it happened, my wife had been a little put out, about something or\nother in the morning; you know how the women-folk get into ways, and\ncome out of them again, without no cause. But when she gets into that\nframe of mind, she never saith much, to justify it, as evil-tempered\nwomen do, but keeps herself quiet, and looks away bigly, and leaves me\nto do things for myself; until such time as she comes round again. So I\ntook a drink of water from the shoot, instead of warming up the teapot,\nand got into bed like a lamb, without a word; leaving her to begin\nagain, by such time as she should find repentance. And before I went to\nsleep, there was no sound to be heard in the house, or in the shop\nbelow; without it was a rat or two, and the children snoring in the\ninner room, and the baby breathing very peaceful in the cradle to the\nother side of the bed, that was strapped on, to come at for nursing of\nher.\n\n\"Well, I can't say how long it may have been, because I sleep rather\nheartily, before I was roused up by a thundering noise going through the\nhouse, like the roaring of a bull. Sally had caught up the baby, and was\nhugging and talking, as if they would rob her of it; and when I asked\nwhat all this hubbub was, 'You had better go and see,' was all she said.\nSomething told me it was no right thing; and my heart began beating as\nloud as a flail, when I crept through the dark to the window in the\nthatch; for the place was as black almost as the bottom of my\ndipping-trough, and I undid the window, and called out, 'Who is there?'\nwith as much strength as ever I was master of, just then.\n\n\"'Come down, or we'll roast you alive,' says a great gruff voice that I\nnever heard the like of; and there I saw a red-hot clinker in my own\ntongs, a sputtering within an inch of my own smithy thatch.\n\n\"'For God's sake, hold hard!' says I, a thinking of the little ones.\n'In less than two minutes I'll be with you.' I couldn't spare time to\nstrike a light, and my hands were too shaky for to do it. I huddled on\nmy working clothes anyhow, going by the feel of them; and then I groped\nmy way downstairs, and felt along the wall to the backway into workshop,\nand there was a little light throwing a kind of shadow from the fire\nbeing bellowsed up; but not enough to see things advisedly. The door had\nbeen kicked open, and the bar bulged in; and there in the dark stood a\nterrible great fellow, bigger than Dascombe, the wrestler, by a foot; so\nfar as I could make out by the stars, and the glimmer from the water.\nOver his face he had a brown thing fixed, like the front of a fiddle\nwith holes cut through it, and something I could not make out was\nstrapped under one of his arms like a holster.\n\n\"'Just you look here, man, and look at nothing else, or it will be worse\nfor you. Bring your hammer and pincers, while I show a light.'\n\n\"'Let me light a lantern, sir,' I said, as well as I could speak for\nshivering; 'if it is a shoeing job, I must see what I am about.'\n\n\"'Do what I say, blacksmith; or I'll squash you under your anvil.'\n\n\"He could have done it as soon as looked; and I can't tell you how I put\nmy apron on, and rose the step out of shop after him. He had got a\nlittle case of light in one hand, such as I never saw before, all black\nwhen he chose, but as light as the sun whenever he chose to flash it,\nand he flashed it suddenly into my eyes, so that I jumped back, like a\npig before the knife. But he caught me by the arm, where you see this\nbig blue mark, and handed me across the road like that.\n\n\"'Blast the horse! Put his rotten foot right,' he says. And sure enough\nthere was a fine nag before me, quaking and shaking with pain and\nfright, and dancing his near fore-foot in the air, like a Christian\ndisciple with a bad fit of the gout.\n\n\"That made me feel a bit like myself again; for there never was no harm\nin a horse, and you always know what you are speaking to. I took his\npoor foot gently, as if I had kid gloves on, and he put his frothy lips\ninto my whiskers, as if he had found a friend at last.\n\n\"The big man threw the light upon the poor thing's foot, and it was\noozing with blood and black stuff like tar. 'What a d----d fuss he makes\nabout nothing!' says the man, or the brute I should call him, that stood\nbehind me. But I answered him quite spirity, for the poor thing was\ntrying to lick my hand with thankfulness, 'You'd make a d----der, if it\nwas your foot,' I said; 'he hath got a bit of iron driven right up\nthrough his frog. Have him out of shafts. He isn't fit to go no\nfurther.' For I saw that he had a light spring-cart behind him, with a\ntarpaulin tucked in along the rails.\n\n\"'Do him where he stands, or I'll knock your brains out;' said the\nfellow pushing in, so as to keep me from the cart. 'Jem, stand by his\nhead. So, steady, steady!'\n\n\"As I stooped to feel my pincers, I caught just a glimpse under the\nnag's ribs of a man on his off-side, with black clothes on, a short\nsquare man, so far as I could tell: but he never spoke a word, and\nseemed ever so much more afraid to show himself than the big fellow was,\nthough he was shy enough. Then I got a good grip on the splinter of the\nshoe, which felt to me more like steel than iron, and pulled it out\nsteadily and smoothly as I could, and a little flow of blood came after\nit. Then the naggie put his foot down, very tenderly at first, the same\nas you put down an over-filled pint.\n\n\"'Gee-wugg's the word now,' says the big man to the other; and sorry I\nam to my dying bones that I stopped them from doing it. But I felt\nsomehow too curious, through the thicket of my fright, and wise folks\nsay that the Lord hath anger with men that sleep too heartily.\n\n\"'Bide a bit,' I told him, 'till I kill the inflammation, or he won't go\na quarter of a mile before he drops;' and before he could stop me, I ran\nback, and blew up a merry little blaze in the shop, as if to make a\nsearch for something, and then out I came again with a bottle in my\nhand, and the light going flickering across the road. The big man stood\nacross, as if to hide the cart; but the man behind the horse skitted\nback into a bush, very nimble and clever, but not quite smart enough.\n\n\"The pretty nag--for he was a pretty one and kind, and now I could\nswear to him anywhere--was twitching his bad foot up and down, as if to\nask how it was getting on; and I got it in my hand, and he gave it like\na lamb, while I poured in a little of the stuff I always keep ready for\ntheir troubles, when they have them so. For the moment I was bold, in\nthe sense of knowing something, and called out to the man I was so\nmortal frit of--'Master, just lend a hand for a second, will you; stand\nat his head in case it stingeth him a bit.' Horse was tossing of his\nhead a little, and the chap came round me, and took him by the nose, the\nsame as he had squeezed me by the arm.\n\n\"'I must have one hind-foot up, or he will bolt,' says I; though the\nLord knows that was nonsense; and I slipped along the shaft, and put my\nhand inside the wheel, and twitched up the tarpaulin that was tucked\nbelow the rail. At the risk of my life it was; and I knew that much,\nalthough I was out of the big man's sight. And what think you I saw, in\nthe flickering of the light? A flicker it was, like the lick of a\ntongue; but it's bound to abide as long as I do. As sure as I am a\nliving sinner, what I saw was a dead man's shroud. Soft, and delicate,\nand white it was, like the fine linen that Dives wore, and frilled with\nrare lace, like a wealthy baby's christening; no poor man, even in the\nworld to come, could afford himself such a winding-sheet. Tamsin\nTamlin's work it was; the very same that we saw in her window, and you\nknow what that was bought for. What there was inside of it was left for\nme to guess.\n\n\"I had just time to tuck the tarpaulin back, when the big man comes at\nme with his light turned on. 'What the ---- are you doing with that\nwheel?' says he, and he caught me by the scruff of the neck, and swung\nme across the road with one hand, and into my shop, like a sack with the\ncorn shot out of it. 'Down on your knees!' he said, with no call to say\nit, for my legs were gone from under me, and I sprawled against my own\ndipping-trough, and looked up to be brained with my own big hammer. 'No\nneed for that,' he saith, for he saw me glancing at it; 'my fist would\nbe enough for a slip such as you. But you be a little too peart, Master\nSmith. What right have you to call a pair of honest men sheep-stealers?'\n\n\"I was so astonished that I could not answer, for the thought of that\nhad never come nigh me. But I may have said--_Shish_--_shish!_ to soothe\nthe nag; and if I did, it saved my life, I reckon.\n\n\"'Now swear, as you hoped to be saved,' says he, 'that never a word\nshall pass your lips about this here little job to-night.' I swore it by\nMatthew, Mark, Luke, and John; but I knew that I never could stick to\nit. 'You break it,' says he, 'and I'll burn you in your bed, and every\nsoul that belongs to you. Here's your dibs, blacksmith! I always pay\nhandsome.' He flung me a crown of King George and the Dragon, and before\nI could get up again, the cart was gone away.\n\n\"Now, I give you my word, Farmer Hornder, and the very same to you Clerk\nChanning, it was no use of me to go to bed again, and there never was a\nnightcap would stay on my head without double-webbing girths to it. By\nthe mercy of the Lord, I found a thimbleful of gin, and then I roused up\nlight enough to try to make it cheerful; and down comes Sally, like a\nfaithful wife, to find out whatever I was up to. You may trust me for\ntelling her a cock-and-bull affair; for 'twas no woman's business, and\nit might have killed the baby.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nTHE NARROW PATH.\n\n\n\"Now, Master Joe Crang,\" the Churchwarden said firmly, but not quite as\nsternly as he meant to put it, because he met the blacksmith's eyes\ncoming out of head; \"how are we to know that you have not told us what\nyou call a cock-and-bull affair? Like enough you had a very fearsome\ndream, after listening to a lot about those resurrection-men, and\nrunning home at night with the liquor in your head.\"\n\n\"Go and see my door ahanging on the hinges, master, and the mark of the\nbig man's feet in the pilm, and the track of wheels under the hedge, and\nthe blood from the poor nag's frog, and the splinter of shoe I pulled\nout with the pincers. But mercy upon me, I be mazed almost! I forgot I\nput the iron in my pocket. Here it is?\"\n\nThere it was sure enough, with dried blood on the jag of it, and the\ndint from a stone which had driven it, like a knife through an\noyster-shell, into the quick. Such is the nature of human faith, that\nthe men, handling this, were convinced of every word. They looked at\neach other silently, and shook their heads with one accord, and gave the\nshivering blacksmith another draught of cider.\n\n\"Joe, I beg your pardon for doubting of your word,\" Farmer John\nanswered, as his own terror grew; \"you have been through a most awesome\nnight. But tell us a thing or two you have left out. What way do you\nreckon the cart came from, and what was the colour, and was there any\nname on it, and by the sound, which way did it drive off?\"\n\n\"Ay, ay, he hath hit it,\" the clerk chimed in; \"the finest head-piece in\nall the county belongeth to the hat of our Master John Horner.\"\n\n\"I'll tell 'e every blessed thing I knows, but one,\" Joe Crang was\ngrowing braver, after handing horrors on; \"can't say which way the cart\ncome from, because I was sound in my bed just then. But her hadn't been\nthrough the ford, by the look of wheels, and so it seems her must have\ncome from Perlycrass direction. The colour was dark; I should say, a\nreddish brown, so far as the light supported me. There was no name to\nsee; but I was on her near side, and the name would be t'other side of\ncourse, if there wur one. Her drove off the way her was standing, I\nbelieve; at least according to the sound of it; and I should have heard\nthe splash, if they had driven through the ford. Any other questions,\nmaster?\"\n\n\"There may be some more, Joe, when I come to think. But I don't see\nclearly how you could have been on the near side of horse, to the other\nside of lane, in case they were coming from our village way.\"\n\n\"You'm right enough there, sir, if so be they hadn't turned. I could see\nby the marks that they went by my shop, and then turned the poor horse,\nwho was glad enough to stop; and then bided under hedge, in a sort of\ndark cornder. Might a' come down the lane a' purpose like, seeking of\nme to do the job. Seemeth as if they had heard of my shop, but not\nezactually where it waz.\"\n\n\"When you come to think of it, might be so.\" Farmer John was pretty safe\nin his conclusions, because they never hurried him. \"And if that was the\nmeaning, we should all have reason to be very joyful, Joe. You cannot\nsee it yet; nor even Master Channing. But to my mind it proveth that the\nchaps in this queer job--mind, I don't say but what they may have been\nrespectable, and driving about because they could afford it--but to my\nmind it showeth they were none of our own parish. Nor next parish\neither, so far as reason goes. Every child in Perlycross, with legs to\ngo on, knows afore his alphabet, where Susscot forge be.\"\n\n\"A' knoweth it too well, afore he gets his breeches. Three quarters of a\nmile makes no odds to they childer, when they take it in their heads to\ncome playing with the sparks. And then their mothers after 'em, and all\nthe blame on me!\"\n\n\"It is the way of human nature, when it is too young. Master Clerk, a\nword with you, before we go too far. Sit down upon this sack, Joe, and\ntry to eat a bit, while the wiser heads be considering.\"\n\nThe Churchwarden took the ancient clerk aside, and the blacksmith\nbeginning to be in better heart, renewed his faith in human nature upon\nbread and bacon.\n\nBefore he was sure that he had finished, the elder twain came back to\nhim, fortified by each other's sense of right, and high position in the\nparish. But Channing was to put the questions now, because they were\nunpleasant, and he was poor.\n\n\"According to my opinion, Master Crang, you have told us everything\nwonderful clear, as clear as if we had been there to see it, considering\nof the time of night. But still there is one thing you've kept behind,\ncausally perhaps, and without any harm. But Churchwarden Horner saith,\nand everybody knows the value of his opinion, that the law is such, that\nevery subject of the King, whatever his own opinion may be, hath to give\nit the upper course, and do no more harm than grumble.\"\n\n\"Big or little, old or young, male or female, no distinction, baronet\nor blacksmith;\" said Farmer John, impressively.\n\n\"And therefore, Joe, in bounden duty we must put the question, and you\nmust answer. Who was the man according to your judgment, that kept so\nclose behind the horse, and jumped away so suddenlike, when the light of\nyour fire shone into the lane? You said that the big man called him\n'Jem,' and you as good as told us that you certified his identity.\"\n\n\"I don't understand 'e, Master Channing. I never was no hand at big\nwords.\" The blacksmith began to edge away, till the farmer took the old\nman's staff, and hooked him by the elbow.\n\n\"No lies, Crang! You know me pretty well. I am not the man to stand\nnonsense. Out of this potato-field you don't budge, till you've told us\nwho the short man was.\"\n\n\"A' worn't short, sir; a' worn't short at all--taller than I be, I\nreckon; but nort to what the other were. Do 'e let go of me, Farmer\nHornder. How could I see the man, through the nag?\"\n\n\"That's your own business, Crang. See him you did. Horse or no horse,\nyou saw the man; and you knew him, and you were astonished. Who was he,\nif you please, Master Joseph Crang?\"\n\n\"I can't tell 'e, sir, if I was to drop down dead this minute. And if I\nsaid ort to make 'e vancy that I knowed the gentleman, I must a' been\nmazed as a drummeldrone.\"\n\n\"Oh, a gentleman, was it? A queer place for a gentleman! No wonder you\ncockle yourself to keep it dark. A five-pound note to be made out of\nthat, Joe; if the officers of justice was agreeable.\"\n\n\"Master Hornder, you'm a rich man, and I be but a poor one. I wouldn't\nlike to say that you behaved below yourself, by means of what I thought;\nwithout knowing more than vancy.\"\n\n\"Joe, you are right, and I was wrong;\" the farmer was a just man,\nwhenever he caught sight of it; \"I was going to terrify of 'e, according\nto the orders of the evil-thinkers, that can't believe good, because it\nbain't inside theirselves. But I put it to you now, Joe, as a bit of\ndooty; and it must tell up for you, in t'other way as well. For the\nsake of all good Christians, and the peace of this here parish, you be\nheld to bail by your own conscience, the Lord having placed you in that\nposition, to tell us the full names of this man, gentleman or ploughboy,\ngipsy or home-liver.\"\n\nThe blacksmith was watching Mr. Horner's eyes, and saw not a shadow of\nrelenting. Then he turned to the old man, for appeal. But the Clerk,\nwith the wisdom of fourscore years, said,--\"Truth goes the furthest. Who\nwould go to jail for you, Joe?\"\n\n\"Mind that you wouldn't give me no peace; and that I says it against my\nwill, under fear of the King and religion\"--Master Crang protested, with\na twist, as if a clod-crusher went over him--\"likewise that I look to\nyou to bear me harmless, as a man who speaketh doubtful of the sight of\nhis own eyes. But unless they was wrong, and misguided by the Devil, who\nwere abroad last night and no mistake, t'other man--in the flesh, or out\nof it, and a' might very well a' been out of it upon such occasion, and\nwith that there thing behind him, and they say that the Devil doth get\ninto a bush, as my own grandmother zee'd he once--'twixt a Rosemary\ntree, which goes far to prove it, being the very last a' would have\nchosen----\"\n\n\"None of that stuff,\" cried the Churchwarden sternly; and the Clerk\nsaid, \"No beating about the bush, Joe! As if us didn't know all the\ntricks of Zatan!\"\n\n\"Well then, I tell 'e--it waz Doctor Jemmy Vox.\"\n\nThey both stood, and stared at him, as if to ask whether his brain was\nout of order, or their own ears. But he met their gaze steadily, and\ngrew more positive, on the strength of being doubted.\n\n\"If ever I zee'd a living man, I tell 'e that man, t'other side of the\nnag, waz Doctor Jemmy Vox, and no other man.\"\n\nThe men of Devon have earned their place (and to their own knowledge the\nforemost one) in the records of this country, by taking their time about\nwhat they do, and thinking of a thing before they say it. Shallow folk,\nhaving none of this gift, are apt to denounce it as slowness of brain,\nand even to become impatient with the sage deliberators.\n\nBoth Horner, and Channing, had excellent reasons for thinking very\nhighly of Dr. Fox. The Churchwarden, because the doctor had saved the\nlife of his pet child Sally, under Providence; and the Clerk, inasmuch\nas he had the privilege of making the gentleman's trousers, for working\nand for rustic use.\n\n\"Now I tell 'e what it is,\" said Farmer John, looking wrathful, because\nhe saw nothing else to do, and Channing shrank back from doing anything;\n\"either thou art a born liar, Joe; or the Devil hath gotten hold of\nthee.\"\n\n\"That's the very thing I been afeared of. But would un let me spake the\ntruth, without contempt of persons?\"\n\n\"Will 'e stand to it, Joe, afore a Justice of the Peace?\" The Clerk\nthought it was high time to put in a word. \"Upon occasion, I mean, and\nif the law requireth.\"\n\n\"There now! Look at that! The right thing cometh, soon or late;\" cried\nthe persecuted blacksmith. \"Take me afore Squire Walders himself--no,\nno, can't be, considerin' I were at his funeral yesterday--well take me\nafore Squire Mockham, if be fitty; and ax of him to putt, I don't care\nwhat it be, stocks, or dead water, or shears atop of me; and I'll tell\nun the very zame words I telled to thee. Can't hev no relief from\ngospel, if the Passon's by the heels; shall have some relief by law, if\nthe Lord hath left it living. No man can't spake no vairer than that\nthere be.\"\n\nThis adjuration was of great effect. \"To Zeiser shalt thou go?\" replied\nthe senior Churchwarden; \"us have no right to take the matter out of\nZeiser's hands. I was dwelling in my mind of that all along, and so was\nyou, Clerk.\"\n\nMr. Channing nodded, with his conscience coming forward; and after some\ndirections at the upper end of field--where the men had been taking it\neasily, and the women putting heads together--the two authorities set\noff along the lane, with the witness between them, towards Perlycross.\n\nBut, as if they had not had enough of excitement to last them for a\nmonth of thoughts and words, no sooner did they turn the corner at the\nfour-cross roads (where the rectory stands, with the school across the\nway), than they came full butt upon a wondrous crowd of people hurrying\nfrom the Churchyard.\n\n\"Never heard the like of it!\" \"Can't believe my eyes a'most.\" \"Whatever\nbe us a'coming to?\" \"The Lord in heaven have mercy on the dead!\" \"The\nblessed dead, as can't help theirselves!\"\n\nThese, and wilder cries, and shrieks, from weeping women along the\ncottage-fronts; while in the middle of the street came slowly men with\nhot faces, and stern eyes. Foremost of all was Sergeant Jakes, with his\nhead thrown back, and his gray locks waving, and his visage as hard as\nwhen he scaled the ramparts, and leaped into the smoke and swordflash.\nBehind him was a man upon a foaming horse, and the strength of the\nvillage fiercely silent.\n\n\"Where be all agoing to? What's up now? Can't any of 'e spake a word of\nsense?\" cried Farmer John, as the crowd stopped short, and formed a ring\naround him.\n\n\"High Jarks, tell un.\"\n\n\"Us was going to your house.\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue, will 'e, and let High Jarks speak.\"\n\nThe Sergeant took discipline, and told his tale in a few strong words,\nwhich made the Farmer's hair stand up.\n\n\"Let me see the proof,\" was all he said; for his brain was going round,\nbeing still unseasoned to any whirl fiercer than rotation of farm-crops.\nAll the others fell behind him, with that sense of order which still\nswayed the impulse of an English crowd; for he was now the foremost\nlayman in the parish, and everybody knew that the Parson was laid up.\nThe gloom of some black deed fell upon them; and they passed along the\nstreet like a funeral.\n\n\"Clap the big gate to, and shoot the iron bar across. No tramping inside\nmore than hath been a'ready.\"\n\nMaster Horner gave this order, and it was obeyed, even by those who\nexcluded themselves. At the west end, round the tower, was a group of\n\"foreign\" workmen--as the artisans from Exeter were called--but under\norders from Mr. Adney they held back, and left the parish matter to the\nnatives thereof.\n\n\"Now come along with me, the men I call for;\" commanded the\nChurchwarden, with his hand upon the bars, as he rose to the authority\nconferred upon him; \"and they be Sergeant Jakes, Clerk Channing, Bob\nthat hath ridden from Walderscourt, and Constable Tapscott, if so be he\nhath arrived.\"\n\n\"I be here, sure enough, and my staff along o' me--hath the pictur' of\nHis Majesty upon him. Make way, wull 'e, for the Officer of the King?\"\n\nThen these men, all in a cold sweat more or less--except Sergeant Jakes,\nwho was in a hot one--backing up one another, took the narrow path which\nbranched to the right from the Churchyard cross, to the corner where\nbrave Colonel Waldron had been laid.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nIN CHARGE.\n\n\n\"My young friend, I must get up,\" Mr. Penniloe exclaimed, if so feeble a\nsound could be called an exclamation. \"It is useless to talk about my\npulse, and look so wise. Here have I been perhaps three days. I am not\nquite certain, but it must be that. And who is there to see to the\nparish, or even the service of the Church, while I lie like this? It was\nmost kind of you--I have sense enough to feel it--to hurry from your\nlong ride, without a bit to eat--Mrs. Muggridge said as much, and you\ncould not deny it. But up I must get; and more than that, I must get\nout. It will soon be dark again, by the shadows on the blind, and I am\nsure that there is something gone amiss, I know not what. But my duty is\nto know it, and to see what I can do. Now go, and have some dinner,\nwhile I just put on my clothes.\"\n\n\"Nothing of that sort, sir, will you do to-day. You are weaker than a\ncat--as that stupid saying goes. That idiot Jackson has bled you to a\nskeleton, put a seton in your neck, and starved you. And he has plied\nyou with drastics, by day and by night. Why, the moment I heard of that\nPerliton booby getting you in his clutches--but thank God I was in time!\nIt is almost enough to make one believe in special Providences.\"\n\n\"Hush, Jemmy, hush? You cannot want to vex me now.\"\n\n\"Neither now, nor ever, sir; as you are well aware. So you must do\nlikewise, and not vex me. I have trouble enough of my own, without\nrebellion by my patients.\"\n\n\"I forgot that, Jemmy. It was not kind of me. But I am not quite clear\nin my head just now. I fear I am neglecting some great duty. But just\nfor the moment, I am not sure what it is. In a minute or two, I shall\nremember what it is.\"\n\n\"No, you won't, my good friend, not for twenty hours yet;\" the young\ndoctor whispered to himself. \"You have had a narrow shave, and another\nday of Jackson would have sent you to the world you think too much of.\nThere never was a man who dwelt in shadows--or in glory, as you take\nit--with his whole great heart, as you do. Well, I wish there were more\nof them, and that I could just be one.\"\n\nThe peace that had settled on the Parson's face was such as no\nlineaments of man can win, without the large labours of a pure life\npast, and the surety of recompense full in view. Fox kept his eye on\nhim, and found his pulse improve, as hovering slumber deepened into\ntranquil sleep. \"Rare stuff that!\" he said, referring not to faith, but\nto a little phial-bottle he had placed upon the drawers; \"he shan't go\nto glory yet, however fit he may be. It is high time,--I take it, for me\nto have a little peck.\"\n\nThe young man was right. He had ridden thirty miles from his father's\nhouse that afternoon, and hearing at the \"Old Barn,\" as he called his\npresent home, of poor Mr. Penniloe's serious illness, had mounted his\nweary mare again, and spurred her back to the rectory. Of the story with\nwhich all the parish was ringing he had not heard a word as yet, being\ncalled away by his anxious mother, on the very night after the Squire\nwas buried. But one thing had puzzled him, as he passed and repassed the\nquiet streets of Perlycross--the people looked at him, as if he were a\nstranger, and whispered to one another as he trotted by. Could they have\nknown what had happened to his father?\n\nWith the brown tops still upon his sturdy legs, and spurs thickly\nclotted with Somerset mud (crustier even than that of Devon) Fox left\nthe bedroom with the door ajar, and found little Fay in a beehive chair,\nkneeling with her palms put together on the back, and striving hard to\npray, but disabled by deep sobs. Her lovely little cheeks and thick\nbright curls were dabbled into one another by the flood of tears; as a\nmoss-rose, after a thundershower, has its petals tangled in the broidery\nof its sheath.\n\n\"Will he die, because I am so wicked? Will he die, because I cannot see\nthe face of God?\" She was whispering, with streaming eyes intent upon\nthe sky-light, as if she were looking for a healthy Father there.\n\n\"No, my little darling, he will not die at all. Not for many years, I\nmean, when Fay is a great tall woman.\"\n\nThe child turned round with a flash of sudden joy, and leaped into his\narms, and flung her hair upon his shoulders, and kissed him, vehemently,\n\n\n     \"With a one, two, three!\n     If you want any more, you must kiss me.\"\n\n\nlike a true tiny queen of the nursery. Many little girls were very fond\nof Dr. Fox; although their pretty loves might end in a sombre potion.\n\n\"Now shall I tell you what to do, my dear?\" said the truly starving\ndoctor, with the smell of fine chops coming up the stairs, sweeter than\neven riper lips; \"you want to help your dear daddy, don't you?\"\n\nLittle Fay nodded, for her heart was full again, and the heel-tap of a\nsob would have been behind her words.\n\n\"Then go in very quietly, and sit upon that chair, and don't make any\nnoise, even with your hair. Keep the door as it is, or a little wider;\nand never take your eyes from your dear father's face. If he keeps on\nsleeping, you stay quiet as a mouse; if he opens his eyes, slip out\nsoftly, and tell me. Now you understand all that, but you must not say a\nword.\"\n\nThe child was gazing at him, with her whole soul in her eyes, and her\nred lips working up and down across her teeth; as if her father's life\nhung upon her self-control. Dr. Fox was hard put to it to look the\nproper gravity. As if he would have put this little thing in charge, if\nthere had been any real charge in it!\n\n\"Grand is the faith of childhood. What a pity it gets rubbed out so\nsoon!\" he said to himself, as he went down the stairs, and the child\ncrept into her father's room, as if the whole world hung upon her pretty\nlittle head.\n\nMrs. Muggridge had lighted two new candles, of a size considered\ngigantic then--for eight of them weighed a pound almost--and not only\nthat, but also of materials scarcely yet accepted as orthodox. For\n\"Composites\" was their name, and their nature was neither sound tallow,\nnor steadfast wax. Grocer Wood had sent them upon trial gratis; but he\nwas a Dissenter, though a godly man; and the housekeeper, being a\nconvert to the Church, was not at all sure that they would not blow up.\nTherefore she lit them first for Dr. Fox, as a hardy young man, with\nsome knowledge of mixtures.\n\n\"He is going on famously, as well as can be, Muggridge;\" the doctor\nreplied to her anxious glance. \"He will not wake till twelve, or one\no'clock, to-morrow; and then I shall be here, if possible. The great\npoint then will be to feed him well. Beef-tea, and arrow-root, every two\nhours, with a little port wine in the arrow-root. No port wine in the\nhouse? Then I will send some, that came from my father's own cellar.\nSteal all his clothes, and keep a female in the room. The Parson is a\nmodest man, and that will keep him down. But here comes my mutton chop.\nWell done, Susanna! What a cook! What skill and science, at the early\nage of ten!\"\n\nThis was one of Dr. Jemmy's little jokes; for he knew that Susanna was\nat least seventeen, and had not a vestige of cookery. But a doctor, like\na sexton, must be jolly, and leave the gravity to the middleman--the\nparson.\n\nBut instead of cutting in with her usual protest, and claim to the\ntriumph, whatever it might be, Mrs. Muggridge to his surprise held back,\nand considered his countenance, from the neighbourhood of the door. She\nhad always been ready with her tit-for-tat, or lifting of her hand in\nsoft remonstrance at his youthful levity. But now the good woman, from\nbehind the candles, seemed to want snuffing, as they began to do.\n\n\"Anything gone wrong in Perlycross, since I went away, Mrs. Muggridge?\nI don't mean the great loss the parish has sustained, or this bad attack\nof Mr. Penniloe's. That will be over, in a few days' time, now his\nproper adviser is come back again. By the way, if you let Jackson come\nin at this front door--no, it mustn't lie with you, I will write a\nlittle note, polite but firm, as the papers say; it shall go to his\nhouse by my boy Jack, to save professional amenities: but if he comes\nbefore he gets it, meet him at the door with another, which I will leave\nwith you. But what makes you look so glum at me, my good woman? Out with\nit, if I have hurt your feelings. You may be sure that I never meant to\ndo so.\"\n\n\"Oh sir, is it possible that you don't know what has happened?\" Thyatira\ncame forward, with her apron to her eyes. She was very kind-hearted, and\nliked this young man; but she knew how young men may be carried away,\nespecially when puffed up with worldly wisdom.\n\n\"I have not the least idea what you mean, Mrs. Muggridge.\" Fox spoke\nrather sternly, for his nature was strong, and combative enough upon\noccasion, though his temper was sweet and playful; and he knew that many\nlies had been spread abroad about him, chiefly by members of his own\nprofession. \"My ears are pretty sharp, as suits my name, and I heard you\nmuttering once or twice--'He can't have done it. I won't believe it of\nhim.' Now if you please, what is it I am charged with doing?\"\n\n\"Oh sir, you frighten me when you look like that. I could never have\nbelieved that you had such eyes.\"\n\n\"Never mind my eyes. Look here, my good woman. Would you like to have\nwicked lies told about you? I have been away for three days, called\nsuddenly from home, before daylight on Saturday morning. My father was\nseized with a sudden attack, for the first time in his life. He is\ngetting old; and I suppose a son's duty was to go. Very well, I leave\nhim on Tuesday morning, because I have urgent cases here; and he has his\nown excellent doctor. I pass up the village, and everybody looks as if I\nhad cut his throat. I go home, concluding that I must be mazed--as you\npeople call it--from want of food and sleep. But when I get home, my own\nman, and boy, and old Betty, all rush out, and stare at me. 'Are you\nmad?' I call out, and instead of answering, they tell me the Parson is\ndying, and at the mercy of Jervis Jackson. I know what that means, and\nwithout quitting saddle come back here and rout the evil one. Then what\nhappens? Why, my very first mouthful is poisoned by the black looks of a\nthoroughly good woman. Tell me what it is, or by George and the Dragon,\nI'll ride home, and drag it out of my own people.\"\n\n\"Can you prove you were away, sir? Can you show when you left home?\"\nThyatira began to draw nearer, and forgot to keep a full-sized chair\n'twixt the Doctor and herself.\n\n\"To be sure, I can prove that I have been at Foxden, by at least a score\nof witnesses, if needful.\"\n\n\"Thank the Lord in heaven, that He hath not quite forgotten us! Susanna,\nhave another plate hot, but be sure you don't meddle with the grid-iron.\nBad enough for Perlycross it must be anyhow; a disgrace the old parish\ncan never get over--but ever so much better than if you, our own\ndoctor----\"\n\n\"Good-bye, Mrs. Muggridge! You'll see me to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Oh no, sir, no. I will tell you now just. How could I begin, when I\nthought you had done it? At least I never thought that, I am sure. But\nhow was I to contradict it? And the rudest thing ever done outside of\nLondon! The poor Squire's grave hath been robbed by somebody, and all\nPerlycross is mad about it.\"\n\n\"What!\" cried Jemmy Fox. \"Do you mean Sir Thomas Waldron? It cannot be.\nNo one would dare to do such a thing.\"\n\n\"But some one hath, sir, sure enough. Mr. Jakes it was, sir, as first\nfound it out, and a more truthfuller man never lived in any parish. My\nmaster doth not know a word of it yet. Thank the Lord almost for this\nchill upon his lungs; for the blow might have killed him, if he had been\nthere, with such a disorderly thing on his back. We must hide it from\nhim, as long as ever we can. To tell the truth, I was frightened to let\nyou go up to him, with every one so positive about the one who did it.\nBut you wouldn't take no denial, and I am very glad you wouldn't. But do\nhave t'other chop, sir; it's a better one than this was. Oh, I beg your\npardon. I forgot to draw the blind down.\"\n\nThe truth was that she had been afraid till now to sever herself from\nthe outer world, and had kept Susanna on the kitchen stairs; but now she\nfelt as certain of the young man's innocence, as she had been of his\nguilt before.\n\n\"Nothing more, thank you,\" said Fox, sitting back, and clenching his\nhand upon the long bread-knife; \"and so all the parish, and even you,\nwere only too delighted to believe that I, who have worked among you\nnearly three years now, chiefly for the good of the poor and helpless,\nand never taken sixpence when it was hard to spare--that I would rob the\ngrave of a man, whom I revered and loved, as if he were my father. This\nis what you call Christianity, is it? And no one can be saved except\nsuch Christians as yourselves! The only Christian in the parish is your\nparson. Excuse me--I have no right to be angry with--with a woman, for\nany want of charity. Come tell me this precious tale, and I'll forgive\nyou. No doubt the evidence is very strong against me.\"\n\nThyatira was not pleased with this way of taking it. She thought that\nthe charity was on her side, for accepting the doctor's own tale so\nfrankly. So she fell back upon her main buttress.\n\n\"If you please, Dr. Fox,\" she said with some precision; \"as women be\nlacking in charity, therefore the foremost of all godly graces, you\nmight think it fairer to see Sergeant Jakes, a military man and upright.\nAnd being the first as he was to discover, I reckon he hath the first\nright to speak out. Susanna seeth light in the schoolroom still though\nall the boys be gone, and books into the cupboards. Ah, he is the true\nbranch for discipline. Do 'e good to look in at the window after dusk,\nand the candles as straight as if the French was coming. 'I am the\nVine,' saith the Lord, 'and ye'--but you know what it is, Dr. Jemmy,\nthough seldom to be found, whether Church it be, or Chapel. Only if you\nmake a point of seeing the man that knoweth more than all of us put\ntogether, the new pupil, Master Peckover, is a very obliging young\ngentleman, and one as finds it hard upon him to keep still.\"\n\n\"Oh, he is come, is he? I have heard some tales of him. It struck me\nthere was more noise than usual in the pupils' room. Let me think a\nmoment, if you please. Yes, I had better see Sergeant Jakes. He may be a\nqueer old codger, but he will stick to what he sees and says. Tell those\nnoisy fellows, that they must keep quiet. They want High Jarks among\nthem with his biggest vine, as you seem to call his cane.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nAT THE CHARGE.\n\n\nStrenuous vitality, strong pulse, thick skin, tough bone, and steadfast\nbrain, all elements of force and fortitude, were united in this Dr. Fox;\nand being thus endowed, and with ready money too, he felt more of anger\nthan of fear, when a quarrel was thrust upon him. While he waited alone\nfor the schoolmaster, he struck Mr. Penniloe's best dining-table with a\nheavy fist that made the dishes ring, and the new-fashioned candles\nthrow spots of grease upon the coarse white diaper. Then he laughed at\nhimself, and put a calm face on, as he heard the strong steps in the\npassage.\n\n\"Sit here, Mr. Jakes,\" he said, pointing to a chair, as the Sergeant\noffered him a stiff salute. \"Mrs. Muggridge, you had better leave the\nroom. This is not a nice matter for ladies. Now Sergeant, what is all\nthis rotten stuff about me?\"\n\n\"Not about you, sir, I hope with all my heart.\"\n\nMr. Jakes met the young man's flashing eyes, with a gaze that\nreplied--\"You don't scare me,\" and drew his chair close enough to study\nevery feature. If the young man was full of wrath, so was the old\nman--implacable wrath, at the outrage to his Colonel.\n\n\"Well, tell your pack of lies\"--Fox was driven beyond himself, by the\nother's suspicious scrutiny--\"oh, I beg your pardon, you believe them\ntrue, of course. But out with your stuff, like a man, sir!\"\n\n\"It is your place to prove it a pack of lies;\" said the old man, with\nhis shaggy eyebrows rigid as a line of British bayonets; \"and if you\ncan't, by the God who made me, I'll run my old sword through your\nheart.\"\n\n\"Rather hard upon me. Not got it here, I hope. Half an hour for\nrepentance, while you fetch it out of some cheese-toasting rack. A nice\nman to teach the youth of Perlycross! What a fool you are, Jakes! But\nthat you can't help. Even a fool though may try to be fair. During your\nlong time in the wars, were you ever accused wrongfully, my friend?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, a score of times. And I like your spirit. If you did what\nthey say of you, you would be a cur. Every evil name you call me makes\nme think the better of you.\"\n\n\"I will call you no more; for I want no favour. All I want is truth\nabout this cursed outrage. Am I to wait all night for it? Now just tell\nyour tale, as if your were sitting at the _Ivy-bush_. You have been in\ncommand of men, no doubt--just command yourself.\"\n\n\"That I will,\" said the veteran with an upward glance--\"not like the\n_Ivy-bush_, but as before the Lord. Sir, I will command myself, as you\nrecommend; and perhaps you would be none the worse, for taking your own\nmedicine.\"\n\n\"Jakes, you are right. It is enough to turn me savage. But you shall not\nhear me speak again, until you have finished.\"\n\n\"It was just like this, sir,\" began the Sergeant, looking round for a\nglass, by force of habit, and then ashamed of himself for such a thought\njust now; \"everybody in this parish knows how much I thought of Colonel\nWaldron; for a better and a braver man never trod this earth. Even\nParson Penniloe will have to stand behind him, when the last muster\ncometh; because he hath not served his country. But I never was\nsatisfied with any of you doctors. You may be very well in your way, Mr.\nFox, for toothing, or measles, or any young complaint; but where is your\nexperience in times of peace? And as for that hang-dog looking chap from\nLondon--well, I won't say what I thought of him; for I always keep my\nown opinions to myself. But I knew it was all over with our poor\nColonel, the moment I clapped eyes on that fellow. Why, I went myself at\nonce, and begged the Colonel to have him drummed out of the parish to\nthe rogue's tattoo. But the good Colonel only laughed, and shook my\nhand--the last time it was, sir, the very last time.\n\n\"You were at the funeral, and there never was a truer one. I was proud\nto my heart, though it felt like lead, to see three old Officers come\nfrom miles away, brave men as ever led a storming column, with tears in\ntheir eyes, and not a thought of their own ends. There was no\nfiring-party as should have been, being nothing but peace going on\nnowadays, and only country bumpkins about here. But I see you are\nimpatient; because you know all that.\n\n\"As soon as all were gone away, and the ground put tidy, I brought a few\nof my own white flowers, as they do in Spanish land, and put them in\nvery carefully with a bit of moss below them, and fastened them so as\nnot to blow away, although there was a strong east wind up. Later on at\nnight, I came again by the little wicket from the schoolroom, just to\nsee that all was right; for my mind was uneasy somehow.\n\n\"The moon was going low, and it was getting very cold, and not a soul\nabout, that I could see. The flowers showed bright, at the head of the\nmound; and close by was a little guardian--the Colonel's pet dog, that\ncould never bear to leave him--she was lying there all in the cold by\nherself, sobbing every now and then, or as it were bewailing, with her\nchin along the ground, as if her heart was broken. It struck me so sad,\nthat I could look at her no more.\n\n\"In the morning I slept past the usual time, being up so late, and out\nof spirits. But I saw the white frost on the ground, and I had a few\nboys to correct before school began, and then lessons to see to till\ntwelve o'clock; and it must have been turned the half hour, when I went\nto Churchyard again, to see how my flowers had stood the frost. I had\nbrought a bit of victuals in my pocket, for the dog; but little _Jess_\nwas gone; and I could not blame her, considering how easily a man\nforgets his dog; and yet I was vexed with her, for being so like us; for\nthe poor things have no religion, such as we make smooth with. My\nflowers were there; but not exactly as I thought I had put them; and the\nbank appeared to me to be made up sharper.\n\n\"Well, Mr. Fox, I am not one of them that notice little things upon the\nearth so much, (as if there was never any sky above them,) and make more\nfuss about a blade of grass, than the nature of men and good metal. I\nthought that old Channing had been at work again, not satisfied with his\nunderstrapper's job. Then I drew forth my flowers; and they looked\nalmost, as if they had been tossed about the yard--crumpled almost\nanyhow, as well as scorched with frost.\n\n\"At this, I was angry, when I thought how kind the poor Colonel had been\nto that old stick of a clerk, and even let him muck up their liveries;\nand so I set off for the old man's cottage, to have a word or two with\nhim, about it. But he was not at home; and little Polly, his\ngrand-daughter, was sure that he had not been near the church that day,\nbut was gone to help dig Farmer John's potatoes.\n\n\"Then back I went again, in a terrible quandary, remembering the wicked\ndoings up the country, and the things that had come across my fancy in\nthe night.\n\n\"The first thing I saw, when I came back by south-gate, was a young man,\nred in the face, and out of breath, jumping, in and out, over graves and\ntombstones, from the west end, where the contractor's work is. 'What are\nyou doing, Bob?' said I, rebuking of him pretty strongly; for I saw that\nit was one of my old boys, now become a trusty sort of groom at\nWalderscourt.\n\n\"'Sergeant, what have you been doing here?' says he 'Our little _Jess_\nhas just come home, with one leg cut in two.'\n\n\"All my blood seemed to stand still, and I should have dropped, if I\nhadn't laid hold of that very tombstone, which the Parson can't endure.\nThe whole of it flashed upon me, in a moment; and a fool I must have\nbeen not to see it all before. But wicked as our men were, and wicked I\nmyself was--as I will not deny it, in the rough-and-tumble times--such a\nblackguard dastard crime was out of my conception. Considering who the\nColonel was; considering what he was, sir!\"\n\nThe Sergeant turned away his face, and desired to snuff the candles. No\nsnuffers were there, for this new invention was warranted not to want\nthem. So he fumbled with his empty sleeve; but it would not come up to\norder; and then he turned back, as if brought to bay, and reckless of\npublic opinion; with his best new handkerchief in his hand--a piece of\ncotton goods imprinted with the Union-Jack in colours.\n\n\"My friend, you are a noble fellow,\" said Fox, with his own wrongs out\nof date, in the movement of large feeling. \"Would to God, that I had any\none as true to me, as you are!\"\n\n\"It is not that,\" resumed the Sergeant, trying to look stern again. \"It\nis the cursed cruelty, that makes me hate mankind, sir. That a man\nshould kill a poor dumb thing, because it loved its master--there,\nthere, the Almighty will smite the brute; for all helpless things belong\nto Him.\n\n\"Well, sir, I hardly know what happened next, or what I said to Bob\nCornish. But he went round the wall, to fetch his horse; and the news\nmust have spread, like wildfire. A young man, who had helped to make up\nthe grave, was going to his dinner through the Churchyard; and seeing us\nthere, he came and looked, and turned like a ghost, and followed us.\nPresently we were in the street, with half the village after us, going\nto the chief Churchwarden's house; for we knew how ill the Parson was.\nAt the cross-roads, we met Farmer John, and old Clerk Channing along of\nhim, looking doiled as bad as we were, and between them the blacksmith\nfrom Susscot ford; and a terrible tale we had from them.\n\n\"Farmer John, as the head of the parish now, took the lead; and well he\ndid it. We went back by the big iron gate, and there we kept the\noutsiders back; and Mr. Adney was as good with his, who were working\nnear the tower. I was ordered to the eastern end, where the stone stile\nleads into Perlycombe lane, by which the villains must have got in; with\nno house there in view of it, but only the tumble-down Abbey. Somebody\nwas sent for my old sword, that I knocked away from the French officer,\nand now hangeth over the Commandments; and I swore that I would slash\noff any hand, that was laid on the edge of the riser; while Adney\nbrought a pile of scaffold-cords, and enclosed all the likelihood of\nfootprints.\n\n\"By this time the other Churchwarden was come, and they all put their\nheads together, and asked what my opinion was; and I said--'Make no\nbones of it.' But they had done a wiser thing than that, with an eye to\nthe law, and the penalties. They had sent Bob Cornish on the fast young\nhorse, the Colonel thought so much of, to fetch the nearest Justice of\nthe Peace, from his house this side of Perliton. Squire Mockham came, as\nstrong as he could ride, with his mind made up about it; and four\ndigging men were set to work at once. Squire Mockham was as sharp about\nit, as if he had just had the lid taken off of him, by death of superior\nofficer; and I, who had seen him on the Bench knock under, to half a\nwink from the Colonel's eye, was vexed with the dignity he took over, by\nreason of being survivor.\n\n\"Clerk Channing will tell you more about the condition of things\nunderground, for I never made them my study; though I have helped to\nbury a many brave men, in the rough, both French and English. My\nbusiness it was to keep people away; and while I was putting a stern\nface on, and looking fit to kill any of the bumpkins, the Lord knows I\ncould never have touched them, for my blood was as cold as snow-water.\nAnd when they sang up--'No Colonel here!' just as if it made no\ndifference--I dropped the French sword, and my flesh clave to my bones,\nthe same as it did to King David. And ever since that, I have been fit\nfor Bedlam; and the boys may stand and make mouths at me.\"\n\n\"I can understand that,\" said Dr. Fox, with his medical instincts\nmoving--generously, as they always do with a man worthy of that high\ncalling--\"Jakes, you are in a depressed condition; and this exertion has\nmade it worse. What you want is a course of carminatives. I will send\nyou a bottle this very night. No more excitement for you at present. Lay\naside all thought of this sad matter.\"\n\n\"As if I could, sir; as if I could!\"\n\n\"No, I am a fool for suggesting that. But think of it, as little as you\ncan. Above all things, go in for more physical exertion. Cane\nhalf-a-dozen boys, before breakfast.\"\n\n\"There's a dozen and a half, sir, that have been neglected sadly.\"\n\n\"That will be a noble tonic. Making mouths at Sergeant Jakes! You look\nbetter already, at the thought of doing duty, and restoring discipline.\"\n\n\"Talk about duty, sir! Where was I? Oh, if I had only gone out again; if\nI had only gone out again, instead of turning into my bed, like a\nsluggard! I shall never forgive myself for that.\"\n\n\"You would just have been killed; as poor _Jess_ was. Such scoundrels\nthink nothing of adding murder to a crime still worse. But before you go\nhome--which is the best thing you can do, and have a dish of hot kidneys\nfrom your brother's shop--one thing I must ask; and you must answer.\nWhat lunatic has dared to say, that I had anything to do with this?\"\n\n\"The whole parish is lunatic; if it comes to that, sir.\"\n\n\"And all the world, sometimes. But who began it? Jakes, you are a just\nman; or you could not be so loyal. Is it fair, to keep me in the dark,\nabout the black things they are saying of me?\"\n\n\"Sir, it is not. And I will tell you all I know; whatever enemies I may\nmake. When a thing flares about, you can seldom lay your hand on the\nman, or the woman, who fired the train. It was Crang, the shoeing smith\nat Susscot ford, who first brought your name into it.\"\n\n\"Crang is an honest, and a simple-minded man. He would never speak\nagainst me, of his own will. He has been most grateful for what I did,\nwhen his little girl had scarlet fever. How could he have started this\ncursed tale?\"\n\n\"From the evidence of his own eyes, sir; according at least to his use\nof them.\"\n\n\"Tell me what he saw, or thought he saw. He is not the man to tell a\nlie. Whatever he said, he believed in.\"\n\nFox spoke without any anger now; for this could be no scheme of his\nenemies.\n\n\"You are wonderful fair, sir;\" said Sergeant Jakes. \"You deserve to\nhave all above board; and you shall have it.\"\n\nTired as he was, and beginning to feel poorly at the threat of medicine,\nthe old soldier told the blacksmith's tale, with as few variations as\ncan contrive to keep themselves out of a repetition. Fox began to see\nthat the case was not by any means so easy, as he first supposed. Here\nwas evidence direct against him, from an impartial witness; a tale\ncoherent, and confirmed by facts independent of it, a motive easily\nassigned; and the public eager to accept it, after recent horrors. But\nhe was young, and warm of faith in friendship, candour, and good-will;\nor (if the worst should come to the worst) in absolute pure justice.\n\n\"It will not take long to put this to rights,\" he said, when the\nSergeant had finished his account. \"No one can really have believed it,\nexcept that blockhead of a blacksmith. He was in a blue funk all the\ntime, and no need to be ashamed of it. There are two people I must see\nto-night--Mr. Mockham, and that Joe Crang himself. I shall borrow a\nhorse from Walter Haddon; my young mare has had enough of it. I shall\nsee how the Parson looks before I go. Now go to bed, Sergeant, as I told\nyou. To-morrow you will find all the wiseacres saying, what fools they\nhave made of one another.\"\n\nBut the veteran shook his head, and said, \"If a cat has nine lives, sir;\na lie has ninety-nine.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nA FOOL'S ERRAND.\n\n\nMr. John Mockham was a short stout man, about five or six and forty\nyears of age, ruddy, kind-hearted, and jocular. He thought very highly\nof Jemmy Fox, both as a man and a doctor; moreover he had been a guest\nat Foxden, several times, and had met with the greatest hospitality. But\nfor all that, he doubted not a little, in his heart--though his tongue\nwas not allowed to know it--concerning the young doctor's innocence of\nthis most atrocious outrage. He bore in mind how the good and gentle\nmother had bemoaned (while Jemmy was in turn-down collars) the very sad\nperversity of his mind, towards anything bony and splintery. Nothing\ncould keep him from cutting up, even when his thumb was done round with\noozing rag, anything jointed or cellular; and the smell of the bones he\ncollected was dreadful, even in the drawer where his frilled shirts were\nlaid.\n\nThe time was not come yet, and happily shall never--in spite of all\nmorbid suisection--when a man shall anatomise his own mind, and trace\nevery film of its histology. Squire Mockham would have laughed any one\nto scorn, who had dared to suggest, that in the process of his brain,\nthere was any connexion of the frills in Jemmy's drawer with the\nblacksmith's description of what he had seen; and yet without his\nknowledge, it may even have been so. But whatever his opinion on the\nsubject was, he did not refuse to see this young friend; although he was\nentertaining guests, and the evening was now far advanced.\n\nFox was shown into the library, by a very pale footman, who glanced at\nthe visitor, as if he feared instant dissection, and evidently longed to\nlock him in. \"Is it come to this already?\" thought poor Fox.\n\n\"Excuse me for not asking you to join us in there,\" Mr. Mockham began\nrather stiffly, as he pointed to the dining-room; \"but I thought you\nmight wish to see me privately.\"\n\n\"I care not how it is. I have come to you, as a Magistrate, and--and--\"\n\"an old friend of the family,\" was what he meant to say, but\nsubstituted--\"as a gentleman, and a sensible and clear-sighted one, to\nreceive my deposition on oath, concerning the wicked lies spread abroad\nabout me.\"\n\n\"Of what use will it be? The proper course is for you to wait, till the\nother side move in the matter; and then prove your innocence, if\npossible; and then proceed against them.\"\n\n\"That is to say, I am to lie, for six months, perhaps twelve months,\nunder this horrible imputation, and be grateful for escaping at last\nfrom it! I see that even you are half inclined to think me guilty.\"\n\n\"All this to a Magistrate is quite improper. It happens that I have\nresolved not to act, to take no share in any proceedings that may\nfollow; on account of my acquaintance with your family. But that you\ncould not know, until I told you. I am truly sorry for you; but you must\neven bear it.\"\n\n\"You say that so calmly, because you think I deserve it. Now as you are\nnot going to act in the matter, and have referred to your friendship\nwith my family, I will tell you a little thing in confidence, which will\nprove to you at once that I am innocent--that I never could by any\npossibility have done it.\"\n\nBefore Mr. Mockham could draw back, the visitor had whispered a few\nwords in his ear, which entirely changed the whole expression of his\nface.\n\n\"Well, I am surprised! I had no idea of it. How could that fool Crang\nhave made such a mistake? But I saw from first how absurd it was, to\nlisten to such fellows. I refused to give a warrant. I said that no\nconnexion could be shown, between the two occurrences. How strange that\nI should have hit the mark so well! But I seem to have that luck\ngenerally. Well, I am pleased, for your dear mother's sake, as well as\nyour own, Master Jemmy. There may be a lot of trouble; but you must keep\nyour heart up, and the winning card is yours. After all, what a thing it\nis to be a doctor!\"\n\n\"Not so very fine, unless your nature drives you into it. And everybody\nthinks you make the worst of him, to exalt your blessed self. So they\ncame for a warrant against me, did they? Is it lawful to ask who they\nwere?\"\n\n\"To be sure it is, my boy. Everybody has a right to that piece of\ninformation. Tapscott was the man that came to swear--strong reason for\nbelieving, etc., with two or three witnesses, all from your parish;\nCrang among the others, hauled in by the neck, and each foremost in his\nown opinion. But Crang wanted to be last, for he kept on shouting, that\nif he had to swear against Doctor Jemmy, the Lord would know that he\nnever meant it. This of course made it all the worse for your case; and\nevery one was grieved, yet gratified. You are too young to know the\nnoise, which the newspapers begin to call 'public opinion,'--worth\nabout as much as a blue-bottle's buzz, and as eager to pitch upon\nnastiness. I refused a warrant--as my duty was. Even if the blacksmith's\ntale was true--and there was no doubt that he believed it--what legal\nconnexion could they show betwixt that, and the matter at the\nchurchyard? In a case of urgency, and risk of disappearance of the\nsuspected person, I might have felt bound to grant it. But I knew that\nyou would stand it out; and unless they could show any others\nimplicated, their application was premature.\"\n\n\"Then, unless you had ventured to stem the I tide, I suppose that I\nshould have been arrested, when I came back to-day from my father's\nsick-bed. A pretty state of law, in this free country!\"\n\n\"The law is not to blame. It must act promptly, in cases of strong\nsuspicion. Probably they will apply to-morrow, to some younger\nmagistrate. But your father is ill? How long have you been with him?\nThey made a great deal out of your disappearance.\"\n\n\"My father has had a paralytic stroke. I trust that he will get over it;\nand I have left him in excellent hands. But to hear of this would kill\nhim. His mind is much weakened, of course; and he loves me. I had no\nidea that he cared much for me. I thought he only cared for my sister.\"\n\n\"Excuse me for a moment. I must go to my guests;\" Mr. Mockham perceived\nthat the young man was overcome for the moment, and would rather be\nalone. \"I will make it all right with them, and be back directly.\"\n\nFox was an active, and resolute young fellow, with great powers of\nendurance, as behoved a man of medicine. Honest indignation, and strong\nsense of injustice, had stirred up his energy for some hours; but since\nlast Thursday night he had slept very little, and the whole waking time\nhad been worry and exertion. So that now when he was left alone, and had\nno foe to fire at, bodily weariness began to tell upon him, and he fell\nback in an easy chair into a peaceful slumber.\n\nWhen the guests had all departed, and the Magistrate came back, he\nstopped short for a moment, with a broad smile on his face, and felt\nproud of his own discretion, in refusing to launch any criminal process\nagainst this trustful visitor. For the culprit of the outcry looked so\nplacid, gentle, good-natured, and forgiving--with the natural expression\nrestored by deep oblivion--that a woman would have longed to kiss his\nforehead, if she had known of his terrible mishap.\n\n\"I have brought you a little drop of cordial, Master Jemmy. I am sure\nyou must want something good, to keep you up.\" Mr. Mockham put a\nspirit-stand and glass upon the table, as Fox arose, and shook himself.\n\n\"That is very kind of you. But I never take spirits, though I prescribe\nthem sometimes for old folk when much depressed. But a glass of your old\nport wine, sir, would help me very much--if I am not giving you a lot of\ntrouble.\"\n\n\"You shall have a glass, almost as good as your father has given me.\nThere it is! How sorry I am to hear about his illness! But I will do\nwhat he would have wished. I will talk to you as a friend, and one who\nknows the world better than you can. First, however, you must forgive\nme, for my vile suspicions. They were founded partly on your good\nmother's account of your early doings. And I have known certain\ninstances of the zeal of your Profession, how in the name of science and\nthe benefits to humanity--but I won't go on about that just now. The\nquestion is, how shall we clear you to the world? The fact that I\ndoubted you, is enough to show what others are likely to conclude.\nUnluckily the story has had three days' start, and has fallen upon\nfruitful ground. Your brother doctors about here are doing their best to\nclench the nail\"--Mr. Mockham, like almost everybody else, was apt to\nmix metaphors in talking--\"by making lame excuses for you, instead of\nattempting to deny it.\"\n\n\"Such fellows as Jervis Jackson, I suppose. Several of them hate me,\nbecause I am not a humbug. Perhaps they will get up a testimonial to me,\nfor fear there should be any doubt of my guilt.\"\n\n\"That is the very thing they talk of doing. How well you understand\nthem, my young friend! Now, what have you to show, against this general\nconclusion? For of course you cannot mention what you confessed to me.\"\n\n\"I can just do this--I can prove an alibi. You forget that I can show\nwhere I have been, and prove the receipt of the letter, which compelled\nme to leave home. Surely that will convince everybody, who has a fair\nmind. And for the rest, what do I care?\"\n\n\"I don't see exactly what to say to that.\" Mr. Mockham was beginning to\nfeel tired also, after going through all his best stories to his guests.\n\"But what says Cicero, or some other fellow that old Dr. Richards used\nto drive into my skin? 'To neglect what everyone thinks of oneself, is\nthe proof not only of an arrogant, but even of a dissolute man.' You are\nneither of these. You must contend with it, and confound your foes; or\nelse run away. And upon the whole, as you don't belong here, but up the\ncountry--as we call it--and your father wants your attention, the wisest\nthing you can do is, to bolt.\"\n\n\"Would you do that, if it were your own case?\" Fox had not much\nknowledge of Squire Mockham, except as a visitor at his father's house;\nand whether he should respect, or despise him, depended upon the answer.\n\n\"I would see them all d----d first;\" the Magistrate replied, looking as\nif he would be glad to do it; \"but that is because I am a Devonshire\nman. You are over the border; and not to be blamed.\"\n\n\"Well, there are some things one cannot get over,\" Dr. Jemmy answered,\nwith a pleasant smile; \"and the worst of them all is, to be born outside\nof Devon. If I had been of true Devonshire birth, I believe you would\nnever have held me guilty.\"\n\n\"Others may take that view; but I do not;\" said the Magistrate very\nmagnanimously. \"It would have been better for you, no doubt. But we are\nnot narrow-minded. And your mother was a Devonshire woman, connected\nwith our oldest families. No, no, the question is now of evidence; and\nthe law does not recognise the difference. The point is--to prove that\nyou were really away.\"\n\n\"Outside the holy county, where this outrage was committed? Foxden is\nthirty miles from Perlycross, even by the shortest cuts, and nearer\nthirty-five, to all who are particular about good roads. I was at my\nfather's bed-side, some minutes before ten o'clock, on Saturday\nmorning.\"\n\n\"That is not enough to show. We all know in common sense, that the ride\nwould have taken at least four hours. Probably more, over those bad\nroads, in the darkness of a November morning. The simplest thing will be\nfor you to tell me the whole of your movements, on the night of this\naffair.\"\n\n\"That I will, as nearly as I can remember; though I had no reason then,\nfor keeping any special record. To begin with--I was at the funeral of\ncourse, and saw you there, but did not cross over to speak to you. Then\nI walked home to the Old Barn where I live, which stands as you know at\nthe foot of Hagdon Hill. It was nearly dark then, perhaps half-past\nfive; and I felt out of spirits, and sadly cut up, for I was very fond\nof Sir Thomas. I sat thinking of him for an hour or so; and then I\nchanged my clothes for riding togs, and had a morsel of cold beef and a\npipe, and went to look for the boy that brings my letters; for old\nWalker, the postman, never comes near the Barn. There was no sign of the\nboy, so I saddled _Old Rock_--for my man was 'keeping funeral' still, as\nthey express it--and I rode to North-end, the furthest corner of the\nparish, to see to a little girl, who has had a dangerous attack of\ncroup. Then I crossed Maiden Down by the gravel-pits, to see an old\nstager at Old Bait, who abuses me every time, and expects a shilling.\nThen homewards through Priestwell, and knocked at Gronow's door, having\na general permission to come in at night. But he was not at home, or did\nnot want to be disturbed; so I lost very little time by that. It must\nhave been now at least nine o'clock, with the moon in the south-west,\nand getting very cold; but I had managed to leave my watch on the\ndrawers, when I pulled my mourning clothes off.\n\n\"From Priestwell, I came back to Perlycross, and was going straight home\nto see about my letters--for I knew that my father had been slightly out\nof sorts, when I saw a man waiting at the cross-roads for me, to say\nthat I was wanted at the Whetstone-pits; for a man had tumbled down a\nhole, and broken both his legs. Without asking the name, I put spurs to\n_Old Rock_, and set off at a spanking pace for the Whetstone-pits,\nexpecting to find the foreman there, to show me where it was. It is a\nlong roundabout way from our village, at least, for any one on\nhorseback, though not more than three miles perhaps in a straight line,\nbecause you have to go all round the butt of Hagdon Hill, which no one\nwould think of riding over in the dark. I should say it must be five\nmiles at least, from our cross-roads.\"\n\n\"Every yard of that distance,\" says the Magistrate, who was following\nthe doctor's tale intently, and making notes in his pocket-book; \"five\nmiles at least, and road out of repair. Your parish ought to be\nindicted.\"\n\n\"Very well. _Old Rock_ was getting rather tired. A better horse never\nlooked through a bridle; but he can't be less than sixteen years of age.\nMy father had him eight years, and I have had him three; and even for a\nman with both legs broken, I could not drive a willing horse to death.\nHowever, we let no grass grow beneath our feet; and dark as the lanes\nwere, and wonderfully rough, even for this favoured county, I got to the\npit at the corner of the hill, as soon as a man could get there, without\nbreaking his neck.\"\n\n\"In that case he never would get there at all.\"\n\n\"Perhaps not. Or at least, not in working condition. Well, you know what\na queer sort of place it is. I had been there before, about a year ago.\nBut then it was daylight; and that makes all the difference. I am not so\nvery fidgetty where I go, when I know that a man is in agony; but how to\nget along there in the dark, with the white grit up to my horse's knees,\nand black pines barring out the moonshine, was--I don't mind confessing\nit--a thing beyond me. And the strangest thing of all was, that nobody\ncame near me. I had the whole place to myself; so far as I could\nsee--and I did not want it.\n\n\"I sat on _Old Rock_; and I had to sit close; for the old beauty's\nspirit was up, in spite of all his weariness. His hunting days came to\nhis memory perhaps; and you should have seen how he jumped about. At the\nrisk of his dear old bones of course; but a horse is much pluckier than\nwe are. What got into his old head, who shall say? But I failed to see\nthe fun of it, as he did. There was all the white stuff, that comes out\nof the pits, like a great cascade of diamonds, glittering in the level\nmoonlight, with broad bars of black thrown across it by the pines, all\ntrembling, and sparkling, and seeming to move.\n\n\"Those things tell upon a man somehow, and he seems to have no right to\ndisturb them. But I felt that I was not brought here for nothing, and\nbegan to get vexed at seeing nobody. So I set up a shout, with a hand to\nmy mouth, and then a shrill whistle between my nails. The echo came\nback, very punctually; but nothing else, except a little gliding of the\nshale, and shivering of black branches. Then I jumped off my horse, and\nmade him fast to a tree, and scrambled along the rough bottom of the\nhill.\n\n\"There are eight pits on the south side, and seven upon the north,\nbesides the three big ones at the west end of the hill, which are pretty\nwell worked out, according to report. Their mouths are pretty nearly at\na level, about a hundred and fifty feet below the chine of hill. But the\ntumbledown--I forget what the proper name is--the excavated waste, that\ncomes down, like a great beard, to the foot where the pine-trees stop\nit--\"\n\n\"_Brekkles_ is their name for it;\" interrupted Mr. Mockham; \"_brekkles_,\nor _brokkles_--I am not sure which. You know they are a colony of\nCornishmen.\"\n\n\"Yes, and a strange outlandish lot, having nothing to do with the people\naround, whenever they can help it. It is useless for any man to seek\nwork there. They push him down the brekkles--if that is what they call\nthem. However, they did not push me down, although I made my way up to\nthe top, when I had shouted in vain along the bottom. I could not get up\nthe stuff itself; I knew better than to make the trial. But I\ncircumvented them at the further end; and there I found a sort of\nterrace, where a cart could get along from one pit-mouth to another. And\nfrom mouth to mouth, I passed along this rough and stony gallery, under\nthe furzy crest of hill, without discovering a sign of life, while the\nlow moon across the broad western plains seemed to look up, rather than\ndown at me. Into every black pit-mouth, broad or narrow, bratticed with\ntimber or arched with flint, I sent a loud shout, but the only reply was\nlike the dead murmuring of a shell. And yet all the time, I felt\nsomehow, as if I were watched by invisible eyes, as a man upon a cliff\nis observed from the sea.\n\n\"This increased my anger, which was rising at the thought that some one\nhad made a great fool of me; and forgetting all the ludicrous side of\nthe thing--as a man out of temper is apt to do--I mounted the most\nconspicuous pile at the end of the hill, and threw up my arms, and\nshouted to the moon, 'Is this the way to treat a doctor?'\n\n\"The distant echoes answered--'Doctor! Doctor!' as if they were\nconferring a degree upon me; and that made me laugh, and grow rational\nagain, and resolved to have one more try, instead of giving in. So I\nclimbed upon a ridge, where I could see along the chine, through patches\nof white among the blackness of the furze; and in the distance there\nseemed to be a low fire smouldering. For a moment I doubted about going\non, for I have heard that these people are uncommonly fierce, with any\none they take for a spy upon them; and here I was entirely at their\nmercy. But whenever I have done a cowardly thing, I have always been\nmiserable afterwards; and so I went cautiously forward towards the fire,\nwith a sharp look-out, and my hunting-crop ready. Suddenly a man rose in\nfront of me, almost as if he jumped out of the ground, a wild-looking\nfellow, stretching out both arms. I thought I was in for a nasty sort of\nfight, and he seemed a very ugly customer. But he only stepped back, and\nmade some enquiry, so far as I could gather from his tone, for his words\nwere beyond my intelligence.\n\n\"Then I told him who I was, and what had brought me there; and he\ntouched his rough hat, and seemed astonished. He had not the least\ndifficulty in making out my meaning; but I could not return the\ncompliment. 'Naw hoort along o' yussen'--was his nearest approach to\nEnglish; which I took to mean--'no accident among us;' and I saw by his\ngestures that he meant this. In spite of some acquaintance with the\nMendip miners, and pretty fair mastery of their brogue, this Whetstoner\nwent beyond my linguistic powers, and I was naturally put out with him.\nEspecially when in reply to my conclusion that I had been made a fool\nof, he answered 'yaw, yaw,' as if the thing was done with the greatest\nease, and must be familiar to me. But, in his rough style, he was\nparticularly civil, as if he valued our Profession, and was sorry that\nany one should play with it. He seemed to have nothing whatever to\nconceal; and so far as I could interpret, he was anxious to entertain me\nas his guest, supposing that time permitted it. But I showed him where\nmy horse was, and he led me to him by a better way, and helped me with\nhim, and declined the good shilling which I offered him. This made me\nconsider him a superior sort of fellow; though to refuse a shilling\nshows neglected education.\n\n\"When I got back to the Ancient Barn--as I call my place, because it is\nin reality nothing else--it was two o'clock in the morning, and all my\nauthorities were locked in slumber. George was on a truss of hay up in\nthe tallat, making more noise than Perle-weir in a flood, although with\nless melody in it; and old Betty was under her 'Mark, Luke, and\nJohn'--as they called the four-poster, when one is gone. So I let them\n'bide, as you would say; gave _Old Rock_ a mash myself, because he was\ncoughing; and went in pretty well tired, I can assure you, to get a bit\nof bread and cheese, and then embrace the downy.\n\n\"But there on my table was a letter from my mother; which I ought to\nhave received before I started; but the funeral had even thrown the Post\nout, it appears. I don't believe that my boy was at all to blame. But\nyou know what Walker the Postman is, when anything of interest is\nmoving. He simply stands still, to see the end of it; sounding his horn\nevery now and again, to show his right to look over other folk's heads.\nEvery one respects him, because he walks so far. Thirty miles a day, by\nhis own account; but it must be eighteen, even when he gets no beer.\"\n\n\"A worthy old soul!\" said the Magistrate. \"And he had a lot of troubles,\nlast winter. Nobody likes to complain, on that account. He is welcome to\nget his peck of nuts upon the road, and to sell them next day at\nPumpington, to eke out his miserable wages. But this is an age of\nprogress; and a strict line must be drawn some where. The Post is\nimportant sometimes, as you know; though we pay so many eightpences, for\nnothing. Why, my friends were saying, only this very evening, that\nWalker must submit henceforth to a rule to keep him out of the coppices.\nWhen he once gets there, all his sense of time is gone. And people are\nnow so impatient.\"\n\n\"But the nutting-time is over, and he has not that excuse. He must have\nbeen four hours late on Friday, and no doubt he was as happy as ever.\nBut to me it would have made all the difference; for I should have\nstarted that evening for Foxden. My mother's letter begged me to come at\nonce; for she feared that my father would never speak again. There had\nbeen some little trifles between us; as I don't mind telling you, who\nare acquainted with the family. No doubt I was to blame; and you may\nsuppose, how much I was cut up by this sad news. It was folly to start\nin that tangle of cross-lanes, with the moon gone down, and my horse\nworn out. I threw myself down upon my bed, and sobbed, as I thought of\nall the best parts of the Governor.\n\n\"What a fool a man is, when a big blow falls upon him. For two or three\nhours, I must have lain like that, as if all the world were in league\nagainst me, and nothing to be done but feel helpless, and rebel. I knew\nthat there was no horse near the place, to be hired for the ride to\nFoxden, even if the owner could be fetched out of his bed. And all the\ntime, I was forgetting the young mare that I had bought about a month\nago--a sweet little thing, but not thoroughly broken, and I did not mean\nto use her much, until the Spring. She was loose in a straw-run at the\ntop of my home-meadow, with a nice bit of aftermath still pretty fresh,\nand a feed of corn at night, which I generally took to her myself. Now\nshe came to the gate, and whinnied for me, because she had been\nforgotten; and hearing the sound I went downstairs, and lit a lantern to\ngo to the corn-bin. But she had better have gone without her supper, for\nI said to myself--why not try her? It was a long way for a young thing\njust off grass; but if only she would take me to the great London road,\nI might hire on, if she became distressed.\n\n\"Of course I went gently and carefully at first, for I found her a\nlittle raw and bridle-shy; but she carried me beautifully, when the\ndaylight came, and would have gone like a bird, if I had let her. She\nwill make a rare trotter, in my opinion, and I only gave fifteen pounds\nfor her. I would not look at fifty now, after the style she brought me\nback--a mouth like a French kid-glove, and the kindest of the kind.\"\n\n\"You deserve a good horse, because you treat them well, Jemmy. But what\nabout your good father?\"\n\n\"Well, sir, thank God, he is in no danger now; but he must be kept very\nquiet. If he were to hear of this lying tale, it might be fatal to him.\nAnd even my mother must not know it. Your Exeter paper never goes that\nway; but the Bristol ones might copy it. My only sister, Christie, is a\nwonderful girl, very firm, and quick, and sensible. Some say that she\nhas got more sense than I have; though I don't quite see it. I shall\nwrite to her to-morrow, just to put her upon guard, with a line for Dr.\nFreeborn too--my father's old friend and director, who knows exactly how\nto treat him. What a rage they will be in, when they hear of this! But\nthey will keep it as close as a limpet. Now what do you advise me to do,\nabout myself?\"\n\n\"You must look it in the face, like a man, of course; though it is\nenough to sour you for life almost, after all your good works among the\npoor.\"\n\n\"No fear of that, sir. It is the way of the world. 'Fair before fierce'\nis my family motto; and I shall try to act up to it. Though I daresay my\ntemper will give out sometimes, especially with brother pill-box.\"\n\n\"You take it much better than I should, I fear;\" Mr. Mockham spoke the\ntruth in this; \"you know that I will do my utmost for you; and if you\nkeep your head, you will tide over this, and be the idol of all who have\nabused you--I mean, who have abused you honestly. You seem to have solid\nstuff inside you, as is natural to your father's son. But it will take a\nlot out of your life; and it seems very hard upon a fine young fellow.\nEspecially after what you have told me. Things will be very black there;\nas you must see.\"\n\n\"Certainly they will. But I am not a boy. I know a noble nature, when I\ncome across it. And if ever there was--but I won't go on with that. If\nshe believes in me, I am content, whatever the low world may say. I have\nnever been romantic.\"\n\n\"I am not at all sure of that, my boy. But I felt that sort of wildness,\nbefore I was married. Now let me put one or two questions to you; just\nto get up your case, as if I was your Counsel. Did any of your people at\nthe Old Barn see you, after your return from the Whetstone Pits?\"\n\n\"Not one, to my knowledge. My household is small, in that ramshackle\nplace. Old Betty upstairs, and George over the stables, and the boy who\ngoes home to his mother at night. I have only those three in the\ndomestic line, except upon great occasions. Old Betty was snoring in her\nbed, George doing the like upon a truss of hay, and the boy of course\noff the premises. They must have found in the morning that I had been\nthere, but without knowing when, or how long I stayed.\"\n\n\"That is most unlucky. Did you pass near the church? Did you meet any\npeople who would know you, anywhere between midnight and morning?\"\n\n\"Neither man, woman, nor child did I see, from the time I left the\nWhetstone Hill, until I passed Perlycombe next morning. It was either\ntoo late, or too early, for our very quiet folk to be stirring.\"\n\n\"Bad again. Very bad. You cannot show your whereabouts, during any part\nof the critical time. I suppose you would know the man on the Whetstone\nHill; but that was too early to help you much. The man at the\ncross-roads--would you know him?\"\n\n\"Not to be certain. He kept in the shadow, and spoke as if he were short\nof breath. And the message was so urgent, that I never stopped to\nexamine him.\"\n\n\"Very little comfort anywhere. Is it usual for Dr. Gronow to be from\nhome at night?\"\n\nMr. Mockham put this question abruptly, and pronounced the Doctor's\nname, as if he did not love him.\n\n\"Not very usual. But I have known it happen. He is wild about fishing,\nthough he cannot fish a bit; and he sometimes goes late to his\nnight-lines.\"\n\n\"He would scarcely have night-lines laid in November, however big a\npoacher he may be. Betwixt you and me, Jemmy, in the very strictest\nconfidence, I believe he is at the bottom of all this.\"\n\n\"I will answer for it, that he is not. In the first place, he is a\ngentleman, though rough in his manners, and very odd. And again he had\nno motive--none whatever. He has given up his practice, and cares more\nfor Walton and Cotton, than for all the Hunterian Museum. And he knew,\nas well as I do, the nature of the case. No, sir, you must not suspect\nhim for a moment.\"\n\n\"Well, then it must be that man--I forget his name--who was staying with\nMr. Penniloe. A very sarcastic, unpleasant fellow, as several people\nsaid who spoke to him. He would take good care to leave no trace. He\nlooked as crafty as Old Nick himself. It will never be found out, if\nthat man did it. No, no, Jemmy, don't attempt to argue. It must be one\nof you three. It is neither you, nor Gronow; then it must be that\nHarrison Gowler.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nTHE LAW OF THE LAND.\n\n\nOne comfort there was among all this trouble, and terror, and\nperplexity--little _Jess_ was not dead, as reported; nor even inclined\nto die, just at present. It was true that she had been horribly slashed\nwith a spade, or shovel, or whatever it might have been; and had made\nher way home on three legs by slow stages, and perhaps with many a\nfainting fit. But when she had brought her evil tidings, and thrown down\nher staunch little frame to die, at the spot where she was wont to meet\nher master, it happened that Mr. Sharland crossed the garden from the\nstables. This was a Veterinary Surgeon, full of skill, and large of\nheart, awake to the many pangs he caused in systems finer than the\nhuman, and pitiful to the drooping head, and the legs worn out in man's\nservice. In a moment he had gathered up the story of poor _Jess_, and he\nsaid, \"if any dog deserves to be saved, it is this faithful little\ndear.\"\n\nThen he pulled off his coat, and tucked up his sleeves, and pronounced\nwith a little pomposity--for a good man should make his impression--\n\n\"Deep cut across the humerus. Compound fracture of the ulna. Will never\ndo much with that limb again. But if the little thing is only half as\nsagacious as she is faithful, and pyretic action does not supervene, we\nshall save her life; and it is worth saving.\"\n\n_Jess_ licked his hand, as if she understood it all, and resigned\nherself to human wisdom. And now she had a sweet bed in a basket, airy\nand buoyant, yet proof against cold draughts; and there she was\ndelighted to receive old friends, with a soft look of gratitude in large\nblack eyes, and a pretty little quiver of the tail too wise to wag, for\nfear of arousing their anxiety. _Pixie_, the pug, had many qualms of\njealousy, as well as some pangs of deep interest--for what dog, however\nhealthy, could feel certain in his heart that he might not be reduced to\nthe same condition? And he was apt to get a human kick, when he pressed\nhis kind enquiries.\n\nBut upon the loftier level of anthropic interests, less of harmony\nprevailed, and more of hot contention. The widowed lady of the house had\nfelt her loss intensely; and with the deeper pain, because her generous\nnature told her of many a time when she had played a part a little over\nthe duty of a loyal wife. Her strong will, and rather imperious style,\nand widely different view-point, had sometimes caused slight\ndisagreements between the Spanish lady and the English squire; and now\nshe could not claim the pleasure of having waived herself to please him.\nBut she had the sorrow of recalling how often she had won the victory,\nand pushed it to the utmost, and how seldom she had owned herself in the\nwrong, even when she had perceived it. A kinder and a nobler husband no\nwoman was ever blessed with; and having lost him, how could she help\ndisparaging every other man, as a tribute to his memory?\n\nEven with her daughter Inez, she was frequently provoked, when she saw\nthe tears of filial love, or heard the unconsidered sigh. \"What is her\nloss, compared with mine?\" \"But for this child, he would have loved me\nmore.\" \"Shallow young creature, like a tinkling zither--she will start a\nnew tune, in a week or two.\" Such were her thoughts; but she kept them\nto herself, and was angry with herself for forming them.\n\nSo it may be supposed, what her fury was, or rather her boundless and\neverlasting rage, when she heard of the miscreant villainy, which could\nnot long be concealed from her. Her favourite maid, Tamar Haddon, was\nthe one who first let fall an unwary word; and that young woman\nreceived a shock, which ought to have disciplined her tongue for life.\nWith a gaze, and a gesture, there was no withstanding, her mistress tore\nout of her everything she knew, and then with a power of self-control\nwhich few men could have equalled, she ordered the terrified damsel\naway, and sat down alone, to think miserably.\n\nHow long she stayed thus, was unknown to any; for Tamar made off with\nall speed to her room, and was seized with a fit of hysterics. But the\nlady's only movement was to press one hand upon her labouring heart. By\nand by she rose, and unlocked the door of her little oratory--a place\nnot very often favoured with her presence. There she took down a\ncrucifix of ivory--not the Indian, but the African, which hardens and\nwhitens with the lapse of years, though green at first, as truth is--and\nshe set it upon a velvet shelf, and looked at it without much reverence.\nIn the stormy times, when Spain was writhing under the heel of an\ninfidel, her daughters lost their religious grounding, and gained fierce\npatriotism. \"My Country is my God,\" was a copy set in schools.\n\nAt first she looked with scorn and pity at such meek abandonment. What\nhad her will and heart to do with mild submission, drooping head, and\nbrow of wan benignity? But the sculptor had told more than that. He had\nfilled the sufferer's face with love, and thrilled the gaze of death\nwith sweet celestial compassion. So well had the human hand conveyed the\ntender heart of heaven.\n\nThe sting of mortal injuries began to grow less venomous. The rancorous\nglare was compelled to soften, and suffused with quivering tears. She\nhad come to have a curse attested, and a black vow sanctified; but\nearthly wrong and human wrath were quelled before the ruth of heaven,\nand conquest of the Tortured One. She fell upon her knees, and laid her\nhands upon the spike-torn feet; and her face became that of a stricken\nwoman, devoted to sorrow, but not to hate.\n\nHow long this higher influence would last is quite another point,\nespecially with a woman. But it proved at least that she was not\naltogether narrow, and hard, and arrogant. Then she went to her bed, and\nwept for hours; and perhaps her reason was saved thereby. At any rate\nher household, which had been in wretched panic, was saved from the\nfearful outburst, and the timid cast-up of their wages.\n\nOn the following morning, she was calm, at least to all outward\nsemblance, and said not a word to any one of the shock she had suffered\nyesterday. But as soon as business-time allowed, she sent for Mr.\nWebber, the most active member of the steady firm, in which her husband\nhad placed confidence. He was good enough to come at once, although, as\nhe told his nervous wife, he would have preferred an interview with the\nlioness, who had just escaped from a travelling menagerie.\n\nBut like all other terrors, when confronted, this proved tolerably\ndocile; and upon his return he described this foreign lady's majestic\nbeauty, and angelic fortitude, in warmer terms than his wife thought\nneedful over his own mahogany. After recounting all he knew, and being\nheard with patience, he had taken instructions which he thought\nsagacious and to the purpose, for they were chiefly of his own\nsuggestion.\n\nNow this Mr. Webber was a shrewd, as well as a very upright man, but of\nrather hasty temperament, and in many of his conclusions led astray,\nwithout the least suspicion of it, by prejudices and private feelings.\nOne of his favourite proverbs was--\"A straw will show how the wind\nblows;\" and the guiding straw for him was prone to float on the breath\nof his own favour. Although he knew little of Dr. Fox, he was partly\nprepared to think ill of him, according to the following inclination.\n\nWaldron Webber, the lawyer's eldest son, and Godson of the brave Sir\nThomas, had shown no capacity for the law, and little for anything else,\nexcept a good thumb for the gallipots. Good friends said--\"What a doctor\nhe will make!\" and his excellent mother perceived the genius, and felt\nhow low it would be to lament that such gifts were seldom lucrative,\ntill half the life is over. So the second son took to the ruler, and the\nelder to the pestle, instruments of equal honour, but of different\nvalue. And Waldron, although his kind father had bought him a snug\nlittle practice at Perlycombe, was nibbling at the bottom of the bag at\nhome, while his brother cast in at the top of it.\n\nWhy was this? Simply because young Fox, the heir of a wealthy family,\nhad taken it into his wicked head to drop down from the clouds at\nPerlycross. It was true that he had bought a practice there; but his\npredecessor had been a decent fellow, observing the rules of the\nProfession. If a man could not pay for it, let him not be ill; or at any\nrate go to the workhouse, and be done for in the lump. But this\ninterloper was addicted to giving tick unlimited, or even remission of\nall charges, and a cure--when nature would not be denied--without the\npatient paying for it, if he had no money. One thing was certain--this\ncould not last long. But meanwhile a doctor of common sense was\ncompelled to appeal to his parents.\n\n\"All cannot be right,\" Mr. Webber senior had observed with emphasis,\nwhen he heard the same tale from his son's bosom friend, Jervis Jackson\nof Perliton; \"there are certain rules, my dear, essential to the\nexistence of all sound Professions; and one of the most fundamental is,\nto encourage nobody who cannot pay. This Fox must be a sadly Radical\nyoung man, though his family is most respectable. Mischief will come of\nit, in my firm opinion.\"\n\nThe mischief was come, and in a darker form than the soundest lawyer\ncould anticipate. Mr. Webber lamented it; and his wife (who had seen\nJemmy waltzing at a Taunton ball with one of her pretty daughters, and\nbeen edified with castles in the air) lifted up her hands, and refused\nto listen to it; until she thought of her dear son. \"If it is the will\nof God,\" she said, \"we must accept it, Theodore.\"\n\nBut this resignation is not enough for an Attorney with a criminal case\nin hand. Lady Waldron had urged despatch; and he knew that she was not\nto be trifled with. He had taken the blacksmith's deposition, which\nbegan as if his head were on the anvil, as well as Farmer John's, and\nChanning's, and that of Mr. Jakes the schoolmaster. And now it was come\nto Monday night; and nothing had been heard of Fox.\n\nBut it was not so easy to know what to do. There was no Police-force as\nyet to be invoked with certainty of some energy, and the\nBow-Street-Runners, as they were called--possibly because they never\nran--had been of no service in such cases, even when induced to take\nthem up. Recourse must be had to the ancient gear of Magistrate and\nconstable; for to move any higher authorities would require time and\ntravel. Strong suspicion there might be, but no strong chain of\nevidence; for no connexion could be established (whatever might be the\ninference) between the occurrence at Susscot and the sacrilege at\nPerlycross.\n\nMoreover, our ancient laws are generally rough, and brisk, and\nable-bodied to stick out bravely for the purse, but leave the person to\ndefend itself. If it cannot do this after death, let it settle the\nquestion with its Maker; for it cannot contribute to the Realm, and\nbelongs to the Resurrection. This larger view of the matter will explain\nto the live content how it came to pass that the legislature (while\nproviding, for the healthy use of anatomy, the thousands of criminal\nbodies despatched for the good of their choicer brethren) failed to\nperceive any duty towards those who departed this life in the fear of\nGod, after paying their rates and taxes, for the term prescribed by\nHeavenly Statute. In a word, when the wicked began to fall\nshort--through clemency human or Divine--no man of the highest\nrespectability could make sure of what he left behind. Only, by the\nancient Common Law, to dig him up again, without a Faculty, was\nindictable as a Misdemeanour.\n\nMr. Webber was familiar with all these truths, and obliged to be careful\nof their import. If the theft of a sheep could be brought home to Fox,\nthe proceeding would have been more simple, and the penalties far\nheavier. But, for his enemies, the social outrage was the thing to look\nat. As it stood, there was small chance yet of saddling the culprit with\nlegal guilt; nevertheless if the tide of general opinion set against\nhim, even the noblest medical science must fail to make head against it.\nAnd the first step was to give some public form to the heinous\naccusation, without risk of enormous damages. Hence the application to\nMr. Mockham, under the name of Tapscott, as before related, and justly\nrefused by that Magistrate.\n\nMr. Webber of course did not appear, nor allow his name to be quoted,\nknowing how small the prospect was of the issue of a warrant. But his\nend was gained, for all who were present--including the Magistrate\nhimself--left the place with dark and strong suspicion against the\nabsent Doctor. The question was certain now to be taken up by County\nJournals; whereupon the accused might well be trusted to do something\nfoolish, even if nothing more were learned from the stealthy watch kept\non him.\n\nThere was much to justify this view; for Fox did many foolish things,\nand even committed blunders, such as none but the sagest of the sage\ncould avoid in his position. He was young, and hot of blood, and raging\nat the sweet readiness of his friends--as such dastards dared to call\nthemselves--to accept the wicked charge against him, on such worthless\nevidence. Now was the time for any generous nature to assert itself; for\nany one with a grain of faith, or even of common charity, to look him in\nthe face, and grasp his hand, and exclaim with honest anger--\"Not a word\nof those cursed lies do I believe. You are an honest fellow, Jemmy,\nwhatever skulks and sneaks may say; and if any one says it in my\npresence, down he goes like a dabchick.\"\n\nDid any one do this, of all who had been so much obliged to him, or even\nof those who without that had praised him in his prosperous days, and\nbeen proud of his acquaintance? It made his young heart cold with\nbitterness, and his kind eyes flash with scorn, when even young fellows\nof healthy nature, jovial manners, and careless spirit, spied something\nof deepest interest across the road, as he came by; or favoured him with\na distant nod, and a passing--\"How doo, Doctor?\" perhaps with an\nemphasis on the title, suggestive of dissection. It was enough to sour\nany man of even bright intelligence, and fair discrimination; for large\nindeed is the heart of him, and heavenly his nature, who does not judge\nof his brethren, by their behaviour to this brother.\n\nYet there were some few, who did behave to this poor brother, as if they\nhad heard of the name of Christ, or deserved, in a way, to do so. These\nwere the very poor, who feel some gratitude for kindness; because it\ncomes not as a right, but a piece of rare luck to them. \"'Tis nort to I,\nwhat the lad hath dooed, and I'll never belave a' dooed it. If it worn't\nfor he, our little Johnny would be in Churchyard, instead of 's cot.\"\nSo spake one or two; and if the reasoning was unsound, why then, so much\nthe worse for reason.\n\nBut a fine young farmer, of the name of Gilham (a man who worked hard\nfor his widowed mother, at the North West end of the parish) came\nforward like a brave Englishman, and left no doubt about his opinion.\nThis young man was no clod-hopper; but had been at a Latin school,\nfounded by a great High-Priest of the Muses in the woollen line, and\nworthy of the _infula_. Gilham had shown some aptness there, and power\nin the resurrection of languages, called dead by those who would have no\nlife without them. His farm was known as the \"White Post,\" because it\nbegan with a grand old proof of the wisdom of our ancestors. Upon the\nmighty turnpike road from London even to Devonport, no trumpery stick of\nforeign fir, but a massive column of British oak had been erected in\nsolid times, for the benefit of wayfarers. If a couple of them had been\nhanged there, as tradition calmly said of them, it was only because they\nstopped the others, and owed them this enlightenment.\n\nFrank Gilham knew little of Doctor Fox, and had never swallowed physic;\nwhich may have had something to do perhaps with his genial view of the\nsubject.\n\n\"A man is a man,\" he said to his mother, as if she were an expert in the\nmatter; \"and Fox rides as straight as any man I ever saw, when his horse\nhas not done too much parish-work. What should I do, if people went\nagainst me like this, and wouldn't even stand up to their own lies? That\nold John Horner is a pompous ass; and Crang loses his head with a young\nhorse, by daylight. Where would his wits be, pulled out of bed at night,\nwith a resurrection-man standing over him? I am thoroughly ashamed of\nthe parish, mother; and though some of our land is under Lady Waldron, I\nshall go and see Fox, and stick up for him.\"\n\nSo he did; and though he was a younger man than Jemmy, and made no\npretence of even offering advice, his love of fair play, and fine\nhealthy courage, were more than a houseful of silver and gold, or a\nlegion of soldiers direct from heaven.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nREASONING WITHOUT REASON.\n\n\nOne of the most unlucky things, that could befall an unlucky man, in the\nhour of tribulation, had befallen that slandered Fox; to wit the\nhelpless condition of the leading spirit, and most active head, in the\ntroubled parish of Perlycross. Mr. Penniloe was mending slowly; but his\nillness had been serious, and the violent chill in a low state of health\nhad threatened to cause inflammation of the lungs. To that it would have\nled, there can be little doubt, but for the opportune return of Fox, and\nthe speedy expulsion of Jackson. Now the difficulty was to keep the\ncurate quiet; and his great anxiety to get to work prolonged the\ndisability, even as a broken arm in splinters is not likely to do\nwithout them, while the owner works a pump.\n\nThe Doctor caught his patient, on the Friday morning, groping his way\nthrough the long dark tunnel which underran the rectory, and just\nemerging, with crafty triumph, into the drive by his own main gate.\nThyatira was gone to Jakes the butcher, after locking the front door and\ncarrying off the key. The parson looked miserably thin and wan, but\nproud of this successful sortie. He was dressed as if for action in his\nSunday clothes, though tottering on his black-varnished stick; while his\ntortoise-shell eyeglass upon its watered ribbon dangled across his\nshrunken chest. But suddenly all his scheme collapsed.\n\n\"Ah, ah, ah!\" he began with his usual exclamation, while his delicate\nface fell sadly, and his proud simper waned into a nervous smile; \"fine\nmorning, Fox; I hope you are quite well--pleasant morning for a walk.\"\n\n\"It may be pleasant,\" returned the Doctor, trying to look most awful;\n\"but like many other pleasant things it is wrong. Will you do me the\nhonour to take my arm?\"\n\nFox hooked the baffled parson by the elbow, and gently led him towards\nhis own front door, guilty-looking, sadly smiling, striving vainly to\nwalk as if he were fit to contest a hurdle-race. But the cup of his\nshame was not full yet.\n\n\"Oh sir, oh!\" exclaimed Mrs. Muggridge, rushing in from the street with\na dish of lamb's fry reposing among its parsley. \"I never would have\nbelieved it, sir, if an Angel was to speak the words. To think that he\nhave come to this!\"\n\n\"She refers to my moral condition, I fear;\" Mr. Penniloe held his head\ndown, while the key he had thought to elude was used to restore him to\nsafer durance. \"Well perhaps I was wrong; but I only meant to go a very\nshort way, I assure you; only as far as the spot where my dear old\nfriend is sleeping.\"\n\n\"What a blessing as we caught you, sir!\" cried the impulsive Muggridge;\nwhile her master looked up in sharp wonder, and the Doctor frowned at\nher clumsiness.\n\n\"Not to the repairs, sir? Oh come, come, come!\" Jemmy cut in rapidly,\nwith this attractive subject.\n\n\"No, not even to the repairs, or I might even say--the arrest of ruin.\nWithout the generosity of my dear friend, we never should have achieved\nso much for the glory of--I will not speak proudly--for the doing up of\nour old church. Those who should have been foremost--but no doubt they\nhad good reason for buttoning up their pockets. Comparatively, I mean,\ncomparatively; for they really did give something. Possibly, all that\nthey could afford.\"\n\n\"Or all they thought they couldn't help. It was very hard upon them,\nsir. But you are getting into a rebellious humour. Sit down by the fire,\nand allow me to examine you.\"\n\n\"I will carry my rebellion further,\" said the invalid, after sitting\ndown. \"I know how kind you have been to me, kinder by far than I ever\ncould deserve. And I believe it was the goodness of the Lord that\ndelivered me from Jackson. He meant well; but he can not be positive\nwhether the lungs should be higher up, or deeper down than the liver. I\nhave been examined, and examiner as well, at Oxford, and in some public\nschools; but the question has never arisen; and I felt myself unable to\nthrow any light on it. Still it struck me that he ought to know, as a\nproperly qualified medical man.\"\n\n\"No, sir, no. That is quite a trifle. That should never have lessened\nyour confidence in him.\" Dr. Fox spoke so gravely, that Mr. Penniloe was\nangry with his own inside.\n\n\"Well, after all, the mind and soul are the parts that we should study.\nI see that I have wronged poor Jackson, and I will apologise. But what I\nhave to say to you is this--even if I am not to take a walk, I must be\nallowed some communication with people of the parish. I have no idea\nwhat is going on. I am isolated as if I had the plague, or the cholera\nof three years ago. Let me see Channing, or Jakes, or Mr. Horner, or\neven Robson Adney.\"\n\n\"In a day or two, sir. You are getting stronger fast; and we must not\nthrow you back. You must have a little patience. Not a service has been\nmissed; and you can do no good.\"\n\n\"That may be true,\" said the parson with a sigh. \"Unhappily they always\ntell me that; but it does not absolve me. All my duties are neglected\nnow. Three pupils, and not a lesson have I heard them. How can that new\nboy get on without me? A very odd youth, from all that I am told. He\nwill require much attention. No, no, it will never do, Fox. I know how\nkind everybody has been, in doing with only one sermon; and the Lord has\nprovided an uncommonly good man. But I feel as if there was something\nwrong. I am sure you are hiding something from me. I am not allowed to\nsee anybody; and even Fay looks odd sometimes, as if the others were\npuzzling her. And the pupils too must have heard of something bad; for\npoor little Michael has been forbidden to talk to any of them. What is\nit? It would hurt me less to know, than to keep on wondering, and\nprobably imagine it worse than it is. And good or bad for my bodily\nhealth, my first duty is not to myself, but to those entrusted to me.\"\n\nMr. Penniloe had spoken with more excitement than he often showed when\nin his usual health, and the doctor had observed it with some alarm. But\nhe had long foreseen that this must come; and it might come in a more\nabrupt and dangerous manner, when he was out of reach. So he made up\nhis mind at once, and spoke without further hesitation.\n\n\"Yes, sir, a most disgraceful thing has happened in this parish; and it\nis better perhaps that you should know it, than be kept in the dark any\nlonger. But you must not be angry with me, though I have given all the\norders which puzzled you. It was not for my own sake, you may be sure;\nfor God only knows how much I have longed for your advice in this\nmiserable affair. And yet, before I tell you, you must promise to do\nnothing whatever about it, for at least three days. By that time you\nwill be yourself again, if we can keep you quiet, and if you take this\nsad blow with your usual strength of mind--and piety.\"\n\nThe parson began to tremble, and the blue lines on his delicate forehead\nshone, like little clues of silk. He fingered his open glasses, and\nbegan to raise them, until it struck him that he might seem rude, if he\nthus inspected Fox throughout his narrative. A rude act was impossible\nto him; so he leaned back in his ancient chair, and simply said--\"Be\nquick, my friend, if you can thus oblige me.\"\n\nThe young man watched him very narrowly, while he told his dreadful\ntale; and Thyatira in the passage sobbed, and opened her\nsmelling-bottle, for she had been making urgent signs and piteous\nappeals from the background to the doctor to postpone this trial. But\nher master only clasped his hands, and closed his quivering eyelids.\nWithout a word he heard the whole; though little starts, and twitching\nlips, and jerkings of his gaiter'd foot, made manifest that self-control\nwas working at high pressure.\n\n\"And who has done this inhuman thing?\" asked Mr. Penniloe at last; after\nhoping that he need not speak, until he felt that he could speak. \"Such\nthings have been done about Bristol; but never in our county. And my\ndear friend, my best friend Tom! We dare not limit the mercy of God; for\nwhat are we? Ah, what are we? But speaking as a frail man should, if\nthere is any crime on earth----\" He threw his handkerchief over his\nhead; for what can the holiest man pronounce? And there was nothing that\nmoved him more to shame, than even to be called a \"holy man.\"\n\n\"The worst of it is,\" said Dr. Fox, with tears in his eyes, for he\nloved this man, although so unlike him in his ways of thought; \"the\nworst of it is--or at least from a wretchedly selfish point of view, the\nworst--that all the neighbourhood has pitched upon the guilty person.\"\n\n\"Who is supposed to have done this horribly wicked thing? Not Gowler?\"\n\n\"No sir; but somebody nearer home. Somebody well-known in the village.\"\n\n\"Tell me who it is, my dear fellow. I am sure there is no one here who\nwould have done it.\"\n\n\"Everybody else is sure there is. And the name of the scoundrel\nis--James Fox.\"\n\n\"Fox, it is not a time for jokes. If you knew how I feel, you would not\njoke.\"\n\n\"I am not joking, sir,\" said Fox, and his trembling voice confirmed his\nwords. \"The universal conclusion is, that I am the villain that did it.\"\n\n\"My dear friend, my noble fellow!\" The Parson sprang up on his feeble\nlegs, and took both of Jemmy's strong thick hands in his quivering\npalms, and looked at him; \"I am ashamed of my parish; and of myself, as\na worthless labourer. And with this crushing lie upon you, you have been\ntending me, day and night, and shown not a sign of your bitter disdain!\"\n\n\"I knew that you would acquit me, sir. And what did I care for the rest\nof them? Except one of course--well you know what I mean; and I must now\ngive up all hope of that. Now take a little of this strengthening stuff,\nand rest for a couple of hours.\"\n\n\"I will take the stuff; but I will not rest, until you have told me,\nupon what grounds this foul accusation has been brought. That I should\nbe in this helpless state, when I ought to go from house to house--truly\nthe ways of Providence are beyond our poor understanding.\"\n\nThe young man told him in a few hot words, upon what a flimsy tale his\nfoes had built this damning charge, and how lightly those who called\nthemselves his friends had been ready to receive it. He had had a long\ninterview with Crang, and had shaken the simple blacksmith's faith in\nhis own eyes; and that was all. Owing to the sharp frost of the night,\nthere was no possibility of following the track of the spring-cart up\nthe road, though its course had first been eastward, and in the\ndirection of the Old Barn. For the same reason, all attempts had failed\nin the immediate scene of the outrage; and the crisp white frost had\nsettled on bruised herbage and heavy footmark.\n\n\"There is nothing more to be done in that way;\" the Doctor finished with\na bitter smile; \"their luck was in the right scale, and mine in the\nwrong one, according to the usual rule. Now what do you advise me to do,\ndear sir?\"\n\n\"I am never very quick, as some men are;\" Mr. Penniloe replied, without\neven the reproof which he generally administered to those who spoke of\n\"luck.\" \"I am slow in perceiving the right course, when it is a question\nof human sagacity. But the Lord will guide this for our good. Allow me\nto think it over, and to make it a subject of earnest prayer.\"\n\nFox was well content with this, though his faith in prayer was limited.\nBut he knew that the clergyman was not of those, who plead so well that\nthe answer tallies with their inclinations. For such devoted labourers,\nwhen a nice preferment comes in view, lay it before the \"Throne of\nGrace;\" and the heavenly order always is--\"Go thou into the fatter\nVineyard.\" Mr. Penniloe had not found it thus, when a College living was\noffered to him as a former Fellow, at a time when he and his wife could\nscarce succeed in making both ends meet. The benefice being in a part of\nWales where the native tongue alone prevailed, his Ministry could be\nblest to none but the occupants of the rectory. Therefore he did not\npray for guidance, but for grace to himself and wife--especially the\nlatter--to resist this temptation without a murmur. Therein he\nsucceeded, to the huge delight of the gentleman next upon the roll, and\nequally ignorant of Welsh, whose only prayer upon the occasion\nwas--\"Thank the Lord, oh my soul!\"\n\nIn the afternoon, when Fox returned according to arrangement, he found\nhis much respected patient looking pale and sad, but tranquil. He had\nprayed as only those who are in practice can accomplish it; and his\ncountenance showed that mind and heart, as well as soul, were fortified.\nHis counsel to Fox was to withstand, and not to be daunted by the most\ninsidious stratagem of the Evil One--whose existence was more personal\nin those days than it now appears, and therefore met more gallantly--to\npay no heed to furtive looks, sly whispers, cold avoidance, or even\nspiteful insults, but to carry himself as usual, and show an example to\nthe world of a gentleman and a Christian.\n\nFox smiled in his sleeve, for his fist was sore with knocking down three\nlow cads that day; but he knew that the advice was sound, and agreed\nwith that of Squire Mockham, only it was more pacific, and grounded on\nlarger principles.\n\n\"And now, my dear young friend,\" the Parson continued very earnestly;\n\"there are two things I have yet to speak of, if you will not think me\nintrusive. You ought to have some one in the Old Barn to comfort and to\ncheer you. The evenings are very long and dark, and now I suppose you\nwill have to spend the greater part of them at home. Even without such\ntrouble as yours, a lonely man is apt to become depressed and sometimes\nbitter. I have heard you speak of your sister, I think--your only\nsister, I believe--and if your father could spare her----\"\n\n\"My father is much stronger, sir. But I could not think of bringing\nChristie here. Why, it would be wretched for her. And if anybody\ninsulted her----\"\n\n\"Who could insult her, in your own house? She would stay at home mostly\nin that very quiet place, and have her own amusements. She would come\nacross no one, but old Betty and yourself. It would feel lonely at\nfirst, no doubt; but a loving sister would not mind that. You would take\ncare not to vex her by speaking of any of the slights you suffered, or\neven referring to the subject at all, whenever it could be avoided. If\nit were only for one week, till you get used to this sad state of\nthings, what a difference it would make to you! Especially if she is of\na lively nature. What is her character--at all like yours?\"\n\n\"Not a bit. She has ten times the pluck that I have. I should like to\nhear any one dare to say a word against me, before Christie. But it is\nnot to be thought of, my dear sir. A pretty coward I should be to bring\na girl here to protect me!\"\n\n\"What is her name? Christine, I suppose. A very good name indeed; and I\ndare say she deserves it.\" The curate looked at Fox, to have his\ninference confirmed; and the young man burst into a hearty laugh--his\nfirst for a most unaccustomed length of time.\n\n\"Forgive me, sir. I couldn't help it. I was struck with the contrast\nbetween your idea of a Christian, and Christie's. Though if any one\ncalled her anything else, he would have a specimen of zeal. For she is\nof the militant Christian order, girt with the sword of the Spirit. A\ngreat deal of St. Peter, but not an atom of St. John. Thoroughly\nreligious, according to her lights; and always in a flame of generosity.\nHer contempt for any littleness is something splendid; except when it is\nfound in any one she loves. She is always endeavouring to 'see herself\nfrom the outside,' as she expresses it; and yet she is inside all the\ntime. Without any motive that a man can see, she flares up sometimes\nlike a rocket, and then she lies rolling in self-abasement. She is as\nfull as she can be of reasoning; and yet there is not a bit of reason in\nher. Yet somehow or other, everybody is wonderfully fond of Christie.\"\n\n\"What a valuable addition to this parish! And the very one to keep you\nup, in this mysterious trial. She would come at once, of course; if she\nis as you describe her.\"\n\n\"Come, sir? She would fly--or at least post with four horses. What a\nsensation in Perlycross! But she is not the one to live in a cupboard,\nand keep silence. She would get up in your pulpit, sir, and flash away\nat your Churchwardens. No, I could not think of bringing her into this\nturmoil. If I did, it would serve me right enough, never to get out of\nit.\"\n\n\"Very well. We shall see,\" Mr. Penniloe said quietly, having made up his\nmind, after Fox's description, to write for this doughty champion,\nwhatever offence might come of it. \"Now one other matter, and a delicate\none. Have you seen Lady Waldron, since this terrible occurrence?\"\n\n\"No; I have feared to go near the house. It must be so awful for them.\nIt is horrible enough for me, God knows. But I am ashamed to think of my\nown trouble, in comparison with theirs. I shall never have the courage\nto go near them.\"\n\n\"It would be a frightful visit; and yet I think that you should go\nthere. But it is most difficult to say. In all the dark puzzles and\ntrials of this world, few men have been placed, I should say, in such a\nstrange dilemma. If you go, you may shock them beyond expression. If you\ndon't go, you must confirm their worst ideas. But there is one who holds\nyou guiltless.\"\n\n\"I am afraid that you only mean--the Lord,\" Jemmy Fox said, with his\neyes cast down. \"It is out of my luck to hope for more. He is very good,\nof course--but then He never comes and does it. I wish that you meant\nsome one nearer.\"\n\n\"My dear young friend, my dear young friend! Who can be nearer to us?\"\nThe Parson thought of his own dark times, and spoke with reproach, but\nnot rebuke. \"I ought to have meant the Lord, no doubt. But in plain\ntruth, I didn't. I meant a mere mortal, like yourself. Oh, how we all\ncome down to ground! I should have referred to Providence. What a sad\nrelapse from duty!\"\n\n\"Relapse more, sir. Relapse more!\" cried the young man, insisting on the\nhuman vein. \"You have gone so far, that you must speak out, as--as a\nMessenger of good tidings.\"\n\n\"Really, Jemmy, you do mix things up\"--the parson's eyes twinkled at\nthis turn upon him--\"in a very extraordinary manner. You know what I\nmean, without any words of mine.\"\n\n\"But how can you tell, sir? Oh, how can you tell? If I could only be\nsure of that, what should I care for anything?\"\n\n\"Young man, you are sure,\" said Mr. Penniloe, placing his hand upon\nJemmy's shoulder. \"Or if you are not, you are not worthy to have faith\nin anything. Next to the word of God, I place my confidence in a woman's\nheart.\"\n\nFox said not another word. His heart was as full as the older man's. One\nwith the faithful memory, and the other with the hopeful faith of love.\nBut he kept out of sight, and made a stir, with a box of powders, and\nsome bottles.\n\nWhen he got home, in a better state of mind than he had been able to\nafford for a long time, out rushed somebody, and pulled him off his\nhorse, and took the whole command of him with kisses.\n\n\"I will never forgive you, never, never!\" cried a voice of clear music,\nout of proper pitch with tears. \"To think that you have never told me,\nJemmy, of all the wicked things they are doing to you!\"\n\n\"Why, Christie, what on earth has brought you here? Look out! You are\ngoing all to tatters with my spurs! Was there ever such a headlong girl?\nWhat's up now?\"\n\n\"It won't do, Jemmy. Your poor mind is all abroad. I saw the whole thing\nin the _Exeter Gazette_. You deserve to be called--even worse than they\nhave called you, for behaving so to me.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nFRIENDS AND FOES.\n\n\nIn for a penny, in for a pound. Throw the helve after the hatchet. As\nwell to be hanged for a sheep as a lamb. He that hath the name may as\nwell enjoy the game.--These and other reckless maxims of our worthy\ngrandsires (which they may have exemplified in their own lives, but took\ncare for their own comfort to chastise out of their children) were cited\nby Miss Christie Fox, with very bright ferocity, for her poor brother's\nguidance. It was on the morning after her arrival, when she had heard\neverything there was to hear, and had taken the mastery of Old Barn, as\nif it were her pony-carriage. Fox stood and looked at her in this queer\nold dwelling-place, which had once been the tithe-barn of the parish,\nbut proving too far from the chief growth of corn had been converted by\nthe Dean and Chapter into a rough and rambling, but commodious and roomy\nhouse; for the tithes of Perlycross were fat, worthy of a good roof and\nstout walls.\n\nShe sat by the window in the full light of the sun,--for she never\nthought much about her complexion, and no sun could disparage it--a\nlovely girl, with a sweet expression, though manifest knowledge of her\nown mind. Her face was not set off by much variety of light and shade,\nlike that of Inez Waldron, dark lashes, or rich damask tint, or\ncontrasts of repose and warmth; but pure straightforward English beauty\n(such as lasts a lifetime) left but little to be desired--except the\ngood luck to please it.\n\n\"There was not too much of her,\" as her father said--indeed he never\ncould have enough--and she often felt it a grievance that she could not\nimpress the majesty of her sentiments, through lack of size; but all\nthat there was of her was good stuff; and there very well may be, as a\ntall admirer of hers remarked, \"a great deal of love in five feet two.\"\n\nHowever this specimen of that stature had not discovered that fact yet,\nas regards any other than her own kin; and now with the sun from over\nHagdon Hill throwing wintry light into her spring-bright eyes, she was\nmaking herself quite at home, as an English girl always tries to do,\nwith her own belongings about her, while she was railing at this strange\nneighbourhood. Not that she meant even half of what she said, but her\nspirit was up, and being always high it required no great leap to get\nfar above the clouds. And her brother kept saying--\"now you don't mean\nthat,\" in a tone that made her do her very best to mean it.\n\nAs for avoiding the subject, and the rest of the cautious policy\nsuggested by the peaceful parson, the young lady met that wise proposal\nwith a puff of breath, and nothing more. In gestures, and what on a\nplainer place would have been called \"grimaces,\" she was so strong, that\nthose who had not that short-cut of nature to the meaning of the moment,\nwere inclined to scoff and mimic; which they could not do at all,\nbecause it was not in them. Jemmy being some years older, and her only\nbrother, felt himself responsible for the worst part of her character.\nHe was conscious, when he thought about it, that he had spoiled her\nthoroughly, from the date of her first crawl on the floor, until her\npath in life was settled. And upon the whole, the result was not so bad\nas to crush him with much self-reproach.\n\n\"All I want is, just to have the names of your chief enemies.\" This\nvaliant sister, as she spoke, spread forth an ivory _deltis_, as that\narrangement then was called, a baby-fan with leaves of no more substance\nthan a wafer. \"Have no fear, Jemmy, I will not kill them, unless my\ntemper rises. You are so abominally forgiving, that I daresay you don't\nknow their names.\"\n\n\"Not I,\" said the Doctor, beginning to fill his after-breakfast pipe,\nfor now he had no round to make among his patients of the paying class;\n\"Chris, they are all alike; they have no ill-will at all against me,\nunless it is Jackson, and young Webber, and half a dozen other muffs\nperhaps, with a grudge because I have saved poor fellows they were\nkilling. I have never interfered in any rich man's case; so they have no\nright to be so savage.\"\n\n\"They are dummies,\" answered Christie, just waving her hand, and then\nstopping it, as if they were not worth the trouble. \"I don't mean them.\nThey could never lead opinion. I mean people of intelligence, or at any\nrate of influence.\"\n\n\"Well really I don't know any of that sort, who have gone against me\nopenly. Such people generally wait to hear both sides, unless their duty\ndrags them into it. Both the Churchwardens are against me, I believe.\nBut that must be chiefly, because they saw with their own wise eyes what\nhad been done. You know, or perhaps you don't, but I do, what an effect\nis produced on the average mind by the sight of anything. Reason seems\nto fly, and the judgment is lost. But Horner is a very decent fellow,\nand I have been of some service to his family. Farrant is a man of great\nhonesty and sense; but carried away perhaps for the moment. I hear that\nhe is coming round to my side.\"\n\n\"Then I won't put down either of them. But come, there must be some one\nat the head of it.\"\n\n\"Upon my word, I don't think there is. Or if there is, he keeps quite in\nthe background. It seems to be rather a general conclusion, than any\nconspiracy against me. That makes it so much harder to contend with. One\nproof of what I say is, that there has been no further application for a\nwarrant, since Mr. Mockham's refusal. If there were any bitter enemy, he\nwould never have been content with that.\"\n\n\"I am not so sure of that,\" replied sage Christie, longing for a foe\nmore definite; \"I am not of course a lawyer, though papa was a\nMagistrate before I was born, and ever since; and that gives me a great\ndeal of insight. And I have come to the conclusion that there is some\none, besides those poor little pill-grinders--you see what comes of\ntaking to the pill-box, Jemmy--some one of a hateful nature, and low\ncunning, who is working in the dark against you. The mischief has been\ndone, and they know that; and they don't want to give you any chance of\nputting your own case clearly, and confounding them. You see that reel\nof silk now, don't you?\"\n\n\"I see about fifty. What a child you are! Are you going to decorate a\ndoll's house?\"\n\n\"I never lose my temper with you, dear Jemmy, because you are so stupid.\nBut if you can't see the force of it, I can. That reel of silk is an\nhonest reel, a reel you know how to deal with. The end is tucked into a\nnick at the side, and you set to at once and thread your needle. But the\none next to it is a rogue--same colour, same size, same everything,\nexcept that the maker has hidden the end, to hide his own short measure,\nso that you may hunt for it for half an hour. Even a man can see that,\ncan't he? Very well, apply that to this frightful affair. If your\nenemies would only come forward, they would give you a chance to clear\nyourself. You would get hold of the end and unwind it, just as I bite\noff this knot. There! What can be easier than that, I'd like to know?\"\n\n\"You are very clever, Christie, but you don't see the real difficulty.\nWho would believe my denial on oath, any more than they would without\nit? I can offer no witness except myself. The man at the pits would\navail me nothing, even if I could get hold of him. There was plenty of\ntime after I left him, for me to have been in the thick of it. I can\nprove no _alibi_. I have only my word, to show that I was in this house\nwhile the miscreants were at work. It is the blackest piece of luck,\nthat poor George was so tipsy, and old Betty was so buried in slumber.\nIt is no good to deceive ourselves, my dear. I shall never be cleared of\nthis foul charge, till the fellows who did the thing are found out.\"\n\nThis was what Jemmy had felt all along; and no one knew better than\nhimself, how nearly impossible it is to bring such criminals to\njustice. But his sister was not to be discouraged.\n\n\"Oh, as for that, I shall just do this. I have money of my own, or at\nleast I shall have plenty of it, when I come of age next year. I'll find\nout the cleverest lawyer about here, a man who is able to enter into\nrogues, and I'll make him advertise a great reward, and promise him the\nsame for himself, if he succeeds. That is the only way to make them look\nsharp. A thousand pounds will be sure to tempt the poor dirty villains\nwho must have been employed; and a thousand pounds will tempt a good\nlawyer to sell his own wife and family. Free pardon to every one, except\nthe instigator. I wonder that you never even thought of that.\"\n\n\"I did think of it long ago. It is the first thing that occurs to an\nEnglishman, in any case of wrong-doing. But it would be useless here. I\nheard much of these cases when I was a student. They are far more\nfrequent than the outer world supposes. But I won't talk about it. It\nwould only make you nervous. It is not a thing for girls to dwell upon.\"\n\n\"I know that very well. I don't want to dwell upon it. Only tell me, why\neven a large reward would not be of any service.\"\n\n\"Because there is only a very small gang; and a traitor would never live\nto get his money. Rewards have been tried, but vainly, except in one\ncase, and then the end was dreadful. For the most part, the villains\nmanage so well that no one ever dreams of what has happened. In the\npresent case, though a most daring one, the villainy would scarcely have\nbeen discovered, except for the poor little faithful dog. If she had\nbeen killed and thrown into the river, perhaps nothing would ever have\nbeen heard of it.\"\n\n\"Oh, Jemmy, what a dreadful thing to say! But surely you forget the\nblacksmith?\"\n\n\"Not at all. His story would have come to nothing, without this to give\nit special meaning. Even as it is, no connexion has been proved, though\nof course there is a strong presumption, between the affair at Susscot,\nand the crime at Perlycross. There was nothing to show where the cart\ncame from. Those fellows travel miles with them, these long nights.\nThere is an old chapelyard at Monkswell, more than a mile from any\nhouse, and I firmly believe--but I will not talk about it.\"\n\n\"Then you know who did this! Oh, Jemmy, Jemmy, is it some horrible\nsecret of your trade?\" Christie leaped up, and away from her brother.\n\n\"I know nothing, except that it happened. I have not the least idea who\nthe scoundrel is. Now no more of this--or you won't sleep to-night.\"\n\n\"I am not a coward--for a girl at least. But this is a dark and lonely\nhouse. I shall have my bed put against the partition of your room,\nbefore ever I go into it this night. Then you can hear me knock, if I\nget frightened.\"\n\nMiss Fox sat down, and leaned her head upon her hands for a moment, as\nin deep meditation upon the wrongs of humanity; and then she announced\nthe result of her thoughts.\n\n\"One thing is certain. Even you cannot deny it. If the Government of\nthis Country allows such frightful things to be done, it is bound to\nprovide every woman in the land with a husband to protect her, or at any\nrate to keep her courage up. If I had seen that cart at Susscot, I\nshould have died with terror.\"\n\n\"Not you. But I must make one rule, I see; and you know there are times\nwhen I will be obeyed. You have come here, my dear child, with the\ngreatest kindness, and no small courage as well, just to keep up my\nspirits, and console me in this trouble. I would never have let you\ncome, if I had known it; and now I will not have your health endangered.\nBack you go, this very day, sad as I shall be without you, unless you\npromise me two things. One is that you will avoid these subjects,\nalthough you may talk of my position. And the other is, that you will\nnot stir from this house, except in my company; and when you are with\nme, you will be totally unconscious of anything anybody says, or\nlooks,--uncivil, unpleasant, or even uncordial. You understand now, that\nI am in earnest.\"\n\nFox struck his solid legs into a stiff position, and crested up his\nwhiskers with his finger-tips; which action makes a very fine impression\non a young man's younger sister.\n\n\"Very well, I agree to all of that;\" said Christie, a little too airily\nfor one who is impressed with an engagement. \"But one thing I must have,\nbefore we begin the new code. Here are my tablets. As you won't tell the\nnames of your enemies, Jemmy, I must have the names of your friends to\nset down. It won't require many lines, I fear, you gentle Jemmy.\"\n\n\"Won't it? Why all the good people about here are on my side, every one\nof them. First, and best of them all, Philip Penniloe. And then, Mr.\nMockham the Magistrate, and then Sergeant Jakes, the schoolmaster. And\nafter him, Thyatira Muggridge, a person of considerable influence,\nbecause she takes hot meat, or pudding, in a basin, to half the old\nwomen in the village, whenever her master can afford it, and can't get\nthrough all of it. That is how they put it, in their grateful way. But\nit strengthens their tongues against his enemies, and they seem to know\nthem--though he doesn't. Well, then there is Farrant, the junior\nChurchwarden, coming round fast to my side. And Baker, the cooper, who\nmade me a tub for salting my last pig; and Channing--not the clerk, he\nis neutral still, but will rally to my side when I pay him twelve\nshillings, as I shall do to-morrow, for a pair of corduroys--but\nChanning the baker, a notable man, with a wife who knows everything\nabout it, because she saw a dark man over the wall last summer, and he\nwould not give his name. She has caused a reaction already, and is\nconfident of being right, because she got upon a pair of steps. Oh you\nmust not imagine that I am forlorn. And then there is Frank Gilham, last\nnot least, a fine young fellow, and a thorough Englishman.\"\n\n\"I like that description. I hate foreigners--as a rule I mean of\ncourse,\" said Christie Fox, with a look of large candour, that proved\nwhat a woman of the world she was; \"there may be good individuals among\nthem, when they have come to know what home-life means; but take them\naltogether, they are really very queer. But surely we ought to know a\nlittle more, as to what it was Mrs. Baker Channing saw; and over the\nChurchyard wall, you say.\"\n\n\"Waste of time, Christie. Why it was back in August, when Harrison\nGowler was staying here. And it was not the Churchyard wall at all, but\nthe wall of the rectory garden, that she peeped over in the dark. It\ncan have had nothing to do with it.\"\n\n\"I am not so sure of that. Things come out so oddly. You remember when\nmy poor _Flo_ was poisoned, how I found it out at last. I never left\noff. I wouldn't leave off. Prying, listening, tip-toeing, even spying,\nwithout any sense of shame. And I found it out at last--at last; and\ndidn't I have my revenge? Oh, I would have hanged that woman, if the law\nhad been worth a farthing, and stuck her all over with needles and\npins.\"\n\n\"You spiteful, and meanly vindictive little creature! But you never\nfound it out by yourself, after all. It came out quite by accident.\"\n\n\"Well, and so will this. You take my word. I dare say I am stupid, but I\nalways prove right. Yet we are bound to use the means of grace, as they\ntell us in every blessed sermon. Oh come, I may go and see your pet\nparson. I'll be bound, I shall not care for him, an atom of an atom. I\nhate those perfect people; they are such a slur upon one. I like a good\nminister, who rides to hounds in pink, and apologises to the ladies,\nevery time he swears. But, come, brother Jemmy, are there no more\nfriends? I have put down all you mentioned, and the list looks very\nshort. There must be a few more, for the sake of Christianity.\"\n\n\"To be sure, there is one more, and a frightfully zealous one--certain\nto do more harm than good. A mere boy, though he flies into a fury at\nthe word. Mr. Penniloe's new pupil--preparing for the church, by tearing\nall across the country. He breaks down all the hedges, and he drives the\nsheep-dogs mad. He is mad as a March-hare himself, by all accounts; but\neverybody likes him. His name is Horatio Peckover, but everybody calls\nhim 'Hopper,' by _syncope_, as we used to say at school. One of his\nfellow-pupils, young Pike, who is a very steady-going young fellow, and\na fine rising fisherman, told me that Hopper is double-jointed; and they\nbelieve it devoutly. They tied him on a chair at his own request, the\nother day, in order that he might learn his lessons. But that only made\nhim worse than ever; for he capered round the room, chair and all, until\nMr. Penniloe sent to ask who was churning butter.\"\n\n\"What a blessing that boy must be in a sick house! But what has made\nhim take up our case, Jemmy?\"\n\n\"The demand of his nature for violent motion. Every day of his life,\nexcept Sunday, he scours the country for miles around. On foot,\nmind--not on horseback, which one could understand. Moreover, he is hot\nin my favour, because he comes from somewhere near Wincaunton, and is a\nred hot 'Zon ov' Zummerzet,' and contemptuous of Devon. But it is not\nfor me to enquire into motives. I shall want every single friend I can\nscrape together, if what I heard, this morning is anything like true.\nYou asked me last night, what Lady Waldron thought.\"\n\n\"To be sure, I did. It seemed most important. But now,\" continued\nChristie, as she watched her brother's face, \"there are reasons why I\nshould scarcely attach so much weight to her opinion.\"\n\n\"The chief reason being that you see it is against me. Well, truly, you\nare a brave reasoner, my dear. But I fear that it is so. I am told that\nmy name must never again be heard in the house, where once I was so\nwelcome.\"\n\n\"Oh, I am rather glad of that. That will go a long way in our favour. I\ncannot tell how many times I have heard not from one, but from all who\nhave met her, that she is a most unpleasant haughty person, even for a\nforeigner. It must lie very heavy on the poor woman's conscience, that\neverybody says she helped, by her nasty nature to shorten her poor\nhusband's days. Possibly now--well, that throws a new light. What has\nhappened may very well have been done at the order of some of his\nrelatives, who knowing her character suspect foul play. And of course\nshe would like to hear no more about it. You know all those foreigners,\nhow pat they are with poison.\"\n\n\"What a grand thing it is to have a sister!\" Fox exclaimed, looking with\nastonishment at Christie, who was quite excited with her new idea.\n\"Better almost to have a sister than--than--I mean than any one else. I\nalmost feared to tell you my last piece of news, because I thought that\nit must upset you so. And behold, it has greatly encouraged you! But\nremember, on no account must you drop a hint, even to our best friends,\nof your last brilliant idea. What frightful things flow into the\nsweetest little head!\"\n\n\"Well, I don't see at all, why I should try to conceal it. I think it\nis a case for very grave suspicions. And if she spreads shameful reports\nabout you, I'll soon let her know that two can play at that.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, my dear child. There is evidence against me. None, nor even a\nshadow of suspicion, against her. She loved Sir Thomas devotedly; and I\nalways thought that jealousy was the cause of her coldness to his\nEnglish friends. But to come to common sense again--what I heard to-day\nsettles my doubts as to what I should do. Penniloe thought that I should\ncall at Walderscourt; though he saw what a difficult thing it was to do,\nand rather referred it to my own decision. I shrank from it, more than I\ncan describe. In fact, I could not bring myself to go; not for my own\nsake but for theirs. But this behaviour on her part puts a new aspect\nupon it. I feel myself bound, as an innocent man, to face her; however\nunpleasant it may be. It will only be the worse, for putting off. I\nshall go, this afternoon.\"\n\n\"I love to bring anything to a point. You are quite right;\" replied\nChristie, with her bright colour rising, at the prospect of a brush;\n\"Jemmy dear, let me come with you.\"\n\n\"Not quite, you gallant Chris! No such luck for me. Not that I want you\nto back me up. But still it would have been a comfort. But you know it\nis out of the question, for a stranger to call, at such a time.\n\n\"Well, I fear it is. Though I shouldn't mind that. But it would look\nvery odd for you. Never mind; I won't be far away. You can leave me\noutside, and I will wait for you, somewhere in the shrubbery, if there\nis one. Not that I would dream of keeping out of sight. Only that they\nmight be afraid to see me.\"\n\n\"They might reasonably fear it, if you looked as you do now. Ferocity\ndoes not improve the quality of your smile, dear. What will mother say,\nwhen you go home? And somebody else perhaps? Now, you need not blush. I\nhave a very high opinion of him.\"\n\n\"Jemmy, I won't have it. Not another word! Get it out of your silly mind\nfor ever. Men never understand such things. There's no romance in me, as\nGoodness knows. But you'll never catch me marrying a man with none of\nit in him.\"\n\n\"You are too young to think of such things yet. Though sometimes even\nyounger girls--but come along, let us have a breath of fresh air, after\nall this melancholy talk. That footpath will take us up to Hagdon in ten\nminutes. You are eager to try our Old-Barn style of victualling, and it\nsuits the system better than your long late dinners. We dine at two\no'clock. Come and get an appetite.\"\n\nA short sharp climb, and with their lungs expanded, they stood upon the\nbreezy hill, and looked back at the valley. Before them rolled the sweep\nof upland, black in some places with bights of fired furze; but streaked\nwith long alleys of tender green, where the flames had not fed, or the\nrains had wept them off. The soft western air, though the winter had\nheld speech with it, kept enough of good will yet, to be a pleasant\nchange for those who found their fellow-creatures easterly. And more\nthan that, the solemn distance, and expanse of trackless grey, hovering\nwith slow wings of sleepy vapour touched with sunshine, if there was no\ncomfort in them, yet spread some enlargement. These things breathed a\nsofter breath, as nature must (though it be unfelt) on young\nimaginations fluttering, like a wisp of brambled wool, in the\nbridle-paths, and stray sheep-walks of human trouble.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nLITTLE BILLY.\n\n\nWhen he has refreshed his memory with the map of England, let any man\npoint out upon it, if he can deliberately, any two parishes he knows\nwell, which he can also certify to be exactly like each other, in the\ncharacter of their inhabitants. Do they ever take alike a startling\npiece of news, about their most important people? Do they weigh in the\nsame balance the discourses of the parson, the merits of those in\nauthority, or the endeavours of the rich to help them? If a stranger\nrides along the street, he is pretty sure to be stared at; but not with\nquite the same expression, as in the last village he came through. Each\nplace has its own style, and tone, vein of sentiment, and lines of\nattitude, deepened perhaps by the lore and store of many generations.\n\nFor instance, Perlycombe, Perlycross, and Perliton, are but as three\npearls on one string, all in a line, and contiguous. The string is the\nstream; which arising at the eastern extremity of Perlycombe parish,\npasses through the village, then westward through Perlycross, and\nwestward still through the much larger village of Perliton. At\nPerlycombe it is a noisy little brook, at Perlycross a genial\ntrout-stream--anon of glassy wanderings, anon of flickered hurry--;\nwhile Perliton, by the time it gets there, entitles it \"the River\nPerle,\" and keeps two boats upon it, which are not always more aground\nthan landsmen should desire.\n\nNow any one would fancy, that these three adjoining parishes would, in\nall their ways and manners, be as like each other as three peas\nvertebrated in one pod. But the fancy would prove that he was only fit\nfor fiction, not for the clearer heights of history such as this. For\nthese three parishes are quite as distinct, one from another, as all\nthree taken together admit that they are, and deserve to be, from the\nrest of England.\n\nAll three are simple, all old-fashioned, highly respectable, and\nwonderfully quiet--except when lashed up by some outrage--slightly\ncontemptuous of one another, and decidedly so of the world outside the\nvalley. From it they differ widely, and from one another visibly, in\ntheir facial expression, and figure, and walk; perceptibly also, in tone\nof feeling, habits of thought (when they think at all), voices, pet\nwords, and proclivities of slouch. So that in these liberal times of\nfree disintegration, each of them has nature's right to be a separate\nnation. And in proof of this, they beat their bounds, and often break\neach other's heads, upon Saint Clement's day.\n\n\"What an extraordinary sound I hear!\" said Christie to her brother, as\nthey turned to quit the hill. \"Just listen a moment. I can't make it\nout. It sounds like a frightful lot of people in the distance.\"\n\n\"Well, I declare, I had forgotten all about it! How very stupid I am\ngetting now!\" cried Jemmy. \"Why this is St. Clement's day, and no\nmistake!\"\n\n\"Who is he? I never heard of him. And, what right has he got to make\nsuch a dreadful noise? He couldn't do it all by himself, Jemmy, even if\nhe was on a gridiron.\"\n\n\"But he has got half of Perlycross to help him. Come here, Chris. Here\nis a nice dry hollow, away from the damp and the mist; and the noise\nbelow follows the curve of it.\"\n\nFox led his sister into a little scarp of flint, with brows of grey\nheather, and russet fern, quivering to the swell of funneled uproar.\n\"Don't be afraid,\" he said, \"it is only our own parish. There ought to\nbe three of them; but this is only ours.\"\n\n\"Well, if your parish can make all that noise, what would all three of\nthem do together? Why ten packs of hounds couldn't equal it!\"\n\n\"You have hit the very point; you have a knack of doing that;\" answered\nJemmy, as he landed her upon a grey ledge. \"We don't let the other two\nin, any more. The business had always been triennial. But the fighting\ngrew more and more serious, till the stock of sticking-plaster could not\nstand it. Then a man of peaceful genius suggested that each parish\nshould keep its own St. Clement's day, at intervals of three years as\nbefore; but in succession, instead of all three at once; so that no two\ncould meet upon the frontier in force. A sad falling off in the spirit\nof the thing, and threatening to be better for the lawyers, than for us.\nPerlycombe had their time last year; and now Perlycross has to redress\nit. Our eastern boundary is down in that hollow; and Perlycombe stole\nforty feet from us last year. We are naturally making a little stir\nabout it.\"\n\n\"If that is a little stir, what would be a big one? But I want to see\nthem; and the fogginess of the trees in that direction stops me. I\nshould say there must be at least five hundred people there. I can't\nstop up here, like a dummy.\"\n\n\"Very well. If you love a row so much. But there are no five hundred\nthere, because it is more than thirty miles round this parish, and the\nbeaters start in two companies from Perle-Weir, one lot to the north and\nthe other to the south, and they go round till they meet each other;\nsomewhere at the back of Beaconhill. One churchwarden with each party,\nand the overseers divided, and the constables, and so on. The parson\nshould be in the thickest of the fray; but I strictly forbade Mr.\nPenniloe, and told him to send Jakes as his deputy. Still I should not\nbe surprised, if he turns up. He is hot upon the rights of his parish.\nCome round this way; there is no fear of missing them, any more than a\npack of hounds in full cry.\"\n\nChristie was quite up for it. She loved a bit of skirmish, and thought\nit might fetch her brother's spirits up again. So they turned the steep\ndeclivity, and after many scratches, crept along a tangled path, leading\ndown to a wooded gully.\n\nHere they found themselves, rather short of breath, but in a position to\ncommand fair view of the crowd, full of action in the dingle and the\nbramble-land. How it could matter to any sane humanity, whether the\nparish-bound ran even half a league, on this side or on that of such a\ndesert wild, only those who dwell on human nature can explain.\n\nHowever so it was; and even Mr. Penniloe had flouted the doctors, and\nwas here, clad in full academicals according to the ancient rule,\nflourishing his black-varnished stick, and full of unfeigned wrath at\nsome gross crime.\n\n\"Thou shalt not move thy neighbour's land-mark\"--he was shouting,\ninstead of swallowing pills; and as many of his flock as heard his text,\nsmote right and left in accordance with it.\n\n\"What on earth is it all about?\" asked Christie, peeping through a holly\nbush, and flushing with excitement.\n\n\"All about that stone down in the hollow, where the water spurts so.\nDon't be afraid. They can't see us.\" The girl looked again, and\nwondered.\n\nSome fifty yards before them was a sparkling little watercourse,\nelbowing its way in hurried zig-zag down the steep; but where it landed\nin the fern-bed with a toss of tresses, some ungodly power of men had\nheaved across its silver foot a hugeous boulder of the hill, rugged,\nbulky, beetle-browed--the \"shameless stone\" of Homer. And with such\neffect, that the rushing water, like a scared horse, leaped aside, and\nswerving far at the wrongful impulse, cut a felonious cantel out of the\nsacred parish of Perlycross!\n\nEven this was not enough. To add insult to injury, some heartless wag\nhad chiselled, on the lichened slab of boulder, a human profile in broad\ngrin, out of whose wicked mouth came a scroll, inscribed in deep\nletters--\"P. combe Parish.\"\n\nThe Perlycrucians stood before this incredible sight, dumb-foundered.\nThus far they had footed it in a light and merry mood, laughing,\nchaffing, blowing horns, and rattling bladders, thumping trees and gates\nand cowsheds, bumping schoolboys against big posts, and daubing every\ncorner of contention, from kettles of tar or sheep-wash, with a big P.\n+.\n\nBut now as this outrage burst upon them, through a tall sheaf of yellow\nflags, their indignation knew no bounds, parochial or human. As soon as\nthey could believe their eyes, they lifted their hands, and closed their\nlips; while the boys, who were present in great force--for Jakes could\nnot help the holiday--put their fingers in their mouths, and winked at\none another. Five or six otter-hounds, from the kennels of a sporting\nyeoman, had joined the procession with much goodwill; but now they\nrecognised the check, and sat upon their haunches, and set up a yell\nwith one accord, in the dismay of human silence.\n\nNot an oath was uttered, nor a ribald laugh; but presently all eyes were\nturned upon the pale Mr. Penniloe, who stood at the side of Mr. Farrant,\nthe junior Churchwarden, who had brought him in his four-wheeled chaise,\nas far as wheels might venture. Few were more pained by this crime than\nthe parson; he nodded under his College cap, and said--\n\n\"My friends, abate this nuisance.\"\n\nBut this was easier said than done, as they very soon discovered. Some\ncalled for crowbars, and some for gunpowder, and some for a team of\nhorses; but nothing of the sort was near at hand. Then Sergeant Jakes,\nas an old campaigner, came to the rescue, and borrowing a hatchet (of\nwhich there were plenty among them), cut down a sapling oak, hard and\ntough and gnarled from want of nourishment; therewith at the obnoxious\nrock they rushed, butting, ramming, tugging, levering, with the big pole\nbelow, and a lot of smaller staves above, and men of every size and\nshape trampling, and kicking out, and exhorting one another. But the\nboulder had been fanged into its socket so exactly, probably more by\nluck than skill, that there it stuck, like a gigantic molar, and\nPerlycross laboured in vain at it.\n\n\"What muffs! As if they could do it, like that! Penniloe ought to know\nbetter; why the pressure is all the wrong way. But of course he is an\nOxford man. Chris, you stay here, till I come back. Cambridge v. Oxford,\nany day, when it comes to a question of engineering.\"\n\nSpeaking too lightly, he leaped in like manner into the yellow-rib'd\nbreast of the steep; while Christie communed with herself, like this.\n\n\"Oh, what a pity he left St. John's! He must have been senior-wrangler,\nif he had stayed on, instead of those horrible hospitals. And people\nwould have thought so much more of him. But perhaps he would not have\nlooked so bright; and he does more good in this line. Though nobody\nseems to thank him much. It would be ever so much better for him, and he\nwould be valued more, if he did ever so much less good. But I like the\nlook of Mr. Penniloe.\"\n\nThe man who should have been senior-wrangler--as every man ever yet sent\nto Cambridge should have been, if justice had been done him--went in a\nstyle of the purest mathematics along the conic sections of the very\nnoble Hagdon. The people in the gully shouted to him, for a single slip\nwould have brought him down upon their hats; but he kept his breath for\nthe benefit of his legs, and his nerves were as sound as an oyster's,\nbefore its pearly tears begin. Christie watched him without fear; she\nhad known the construction of his legs, from the days of balusters and\nrocking-horses.\n\n\"Give me up a good pole--not too heavy--you see how I have got to throw\nmy weight; but a bit of good stuff with an elbow to it.\"\n\nThus spake Jemmy, and the others did their best. He stuck his heel and\nfootside into a soft place he had found, and let the ledge of harder\nstuff overlap his boot-vamps, then he took the springy spar of ash which\nsome one had handed up to him, for he stood about twelve feet above\nthem, and getting good purchase against a scrag of flint, brought the\nconvexity of his pole to bear on the topmost jag of boulder.\n\n\"Slew away as high as you can reach,\" he cried; \"but don't touch it\nanywhere near the bottom.\" As they all put their weights to it, the rock\nbegan to sway, and with a heavy groan lurched sideways.\n\n\"Stand clear!\" cried Jemmy, as the whole bunk swang, with the pillar of\nwater helping it, and then settled grandly back into the other niche,\nwith the volume of the fall leaping generously into the parish of\nPerlycombe.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted everybody young enough to shout; while the elder men\nleant upon their staves, and thanked the Lord. Not less than forty feet\nwas recovered, and another forty added from the substance of big rogues.\n\"'Tis the finest thing done ever since I were a boy,\" said the oldest\nman present, as he wiped his dripping face. \"Measter Vox, come down, and\nshake hands round. Us will never believe any harm of thee no more.\"\n\nThis reasoning was rather of the heart than head; but it held good all\nround, as it generally does. And now as the sound of the water went away\ninto its proper course, with the joy of the just pursuing it, Miss Fox,\nwho had watched all proceedings from the ridge, could hear how the\ncurrent of public opinion was diverted and rushing in her brother's\nfavour. So she pinned up a torn skirt, and smoothed out another, and\nputting back her bright hair, tripped down the wooded slope, and stood\nwith a charming blush before them. The labourers touched their hats, and\nthe farmers lifted theirs, and every one tried to look his best; for\nPerlycross being a poetical parish is always very wide awake to beauty.\n\n\"My sister!\" explained Dr. Fox with just pride. \"My sister, Mr.\nPenniloe! My sister, Mr. Farrant! Sergeant Jakes, my sister! Miss\nChristie Fox will be glad to know you all.\"\n\n\"And I am sure that everybody will be glad to know Miss Fox,\" said the\nParson, coming forward with his soft sweet smile. \"At any time she would\nbe welcome; but now she is come at the time of all times. Behold what\nyour brother has done, Miss Fox! That stream is the parish boundary.\"\n\n\"He maketh the river to run in dry places;\" cried Channing the clerk,\nwho had been pulling at his keg, \"and lo, he hath taken away the\nreproach of his people, Israel!\"\n\n\"Mr. Channing! Fie, Mr. Channing!\" began the representative of the upper\ndesk, and then suddenly checked himself, lest he should put the old man\nto shame, before the children of the parish.\n\n\"By the by,\" said Mr. Farrant, coming in to fill the pause; \"Dr. Fox is\nthe likeliest person to tell us what this curious implement is. It looks\nlike a surgical instrument of some sort. We found it, Doctor, in this\nsame watercourse, about a furlong further down, where the Blackmarsh\nlane goes through it. We were putting our parish-mark on the old tree\nthat overhangs a deep hole, when this young gent who is uncommon spry--I\nwish you luck of him, I'm sure, Mr. Penniloe--there he spies it, and in\nhe goes, like an otter, and out with it, before he could get wet,\nalmost.\"\n\n\"Not likely I was going to leave it there,\" young Peckover interrupted;\n\"I thought it was a clot of eels, or a pair of gloves, or something.\nThough of course a glove would float, when you come to think of it.\nPerhaps the young lady knows--she looks so clever.\"\n\n\"Hopper, no cheek!\" Dr. Fox spoke sharply, for the youth was staring at\nhis sister. \"Mr. Farrant, I can't tell you what it is; for I never saw a\nsurgical instrument like it. I should say it was more like a\nblacksmith's, or perhaps a turner's tool; though not at all a common\none, in either business. Is Crang here, or one of his apprentices?\"\n\n\"No, sir. Joe is at home to-day--got a heavy job,\" answered someone in\nthe crowd; \"and the two prentices be gone with t'other lot of us.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what I'll do;\" volunteered the Hopper, who was fuming at\nthe slowness of parochial demarcation, for he would have been at the\nback of Beacon Hill by this time; \"I'll go straight with it to Susscot,\nand be back again before these old codgers have done a brace of meadows.\nIt is frightful cold work to stand about like this. I found it, and I'll\nfind out what it is too.\"\n\nThe tool was handed to him, and he set off, like a chamois, in a\nstraight line westward; while two or three farmers, who had suffered\nalready from his steeplechase tracks, would have sent a brief word after\nhim, but for the parson's presence. Fox, who was amused with this\nspecimen of his county, ran part way up the hill to watch his course,\nand then beckoned to his sister, to return to the Old Barn by the\nfootpath along the foot of Hagdon.\n\nThey had scarcely finished dinner, which they had to take in haste, by\nreason of the shortness of the days, and their intended visit to\nWalderscourt, when Joe Crang the blacksmith appeared in the yard,\npulling his hat off, and putting it on again, and wiping his face with a\ntongs-swab.\n\nFox saw that the man was in a state of much excitement, and made him\ncome in, while Miss Christie went upstairs, to prepare for their drive\nto Walderscourt.\n\n\"What's the matter, Crang? Take a chair there. You needn't be nervous,\"\nsaid the Doctor kindly; \"I have no grudge against you for saying what\nyou believe. It has done me a world of harm, no doubt; but it's no fault\nof yours. It's only my bad luck, that some fellow very like me, and also\na Jemmy, should have been in that black job that night. But I wish you\nhad just shown a little more pluck, as I told you the other day. If you\nhad just gone round the horse and looked; or even sung out--'Is that\nyou, Doctor?' why you might have saved me from--from knowing so much\nabout my friends.\"\n\n\"Oh sir, 'twaz an awesome night! But what I be come for to say, sir, is\njust this. I absolve 'e, sir; I absolve 'e, Measter Vox. If that be the\nright word,--and a' cometh from the Baible, I absolve 'e, Measter Vox.\"\n\n\"Absolve me from what, Crang? I have done nothing. You mean, I suppose,\nthat you acquit me?\"\n\n\"Well now, you would never believe--but that's the very word of\ndiscoorse that have been sticking in my throat all the way from the\nford. You never done it, sir,--not you. You never done it, sir! You may\nput me on my oath.\"\n\n\"But you have been very much upon your oath, ever since it happened,\nthat I was the man, and no other man, that did the whole of it, Joseph\nCrang. And the ale you have had on the strength of it!\"\n\n\"The ale, sir, is neither here nor there\"--the blacksmith looked hurt by\nthis imputation--\"it cometh to-day, and it goeth to-morrow, the same as\nthe flowers of the field. But the truth is the thing as abideth, Measter\nJemmy. Not but what the ale might come, upon the other view of it.\nLikewise, likewise--if the Lord in heaven ordereth it, the same as the\nquails from the sky, sir.\"\n\n\"The miracle would be if it failed to come, wherever you are, Joseph.\nBut what has converted you from glasses against me, to glasses in my\nfavour?\"\n\n\"Nothing more than this, sir. Seemeth to a loose mind neither here nor\nthere. But to them that knoweth it, beyond when human mind began,\nperhaps afore the flood waz, there's nought that speaks like Little\nBilly.\"\n\n\"Why this,\" exclaimed Fox, as he unrolled the last new leathern apron of\nthe firm of Crang and wife, \"this is the thing they found to-day in\nbeating the bounds of the parish. Nobody could make out what it was.\nWhat can it have to do with me, or the sad affair at Perlycross?\"\n\n\"Little Billy, sir,\" replied the blacksmith, dandling the tool with\nhonest love, as he promptly recovered it from Fox, \"have been in our\nfamily from father to son, since time runneth not to the contrary. Half\nher can do is unbeknown to me, not having the brains as used to be. Ah,\nwe was clever people then, afore the times of the New Covenant. It\nrunneth in our race that there was a Joe Crang did the crafty work for\nthe Tabernacle as was set up in the wilderness. And it might a' been him\nas made Little Billy.\"\n\n\"Very hard indeed to prove. Harder still to disprove. But giving you the\nbenefit of the doubt, Master Crang, how have you used this magic tool\nyourself?\"\n\n\"That's where the very pint of the whole thing lies; that's what shows\nthem up so ungrateful, sir. Not a soul in the parish to remember what\nLittle Billy hath been to them! Mind, I don't say as I understand this\ntool, though I does a'most anything with her. But for them not to know!\nFor them to send to ax the name of 'un, when there bain't one in ten of\n'em as hathn't roared over 'un, when her was screwed to a big back\ntooth.\"\n\n\"The ungrateful villains! It is really too bad. So after all, it proves\nto be what Mr. Farrant thought it was--a genuine surgical instrument.\nBut go on, Crang; will you never tell me how this amounts to any proof,\neither of my guilt or innocence?\"\n\n\"Why according of this here, sir, and no way out of it. Little Billy\nwere took off my shelf, where her always bideth from father to son, by\nthe big man as come along of the lame horse and the cart, that night.\nWhen I was a kneeling down, I zeed 'un put his hand to it, though I\ndussn't say a word for the life of me. And he slipped 'un into his\npocket, same as he would a penny dolly.\"\n\n\"Come now, that does seem more important,\" said the Doctor cogitating.\n\"But what could the fellow have wanted it for?\"\n\n\"Can't tell 'e, sir,\" replied the blacksmith. \"For some of his\nunchristian work, maybe. Or he might have thought it would came in\nhandy, if aught should go amiss with the poor nag again. Many's the shoe\nI've punched off with Little Billy.\"\n\n\"A Billy of all trades it seems to be. But how does the recovery of this\ntool show that you made a mistake about me, Crang?\"\n\n\"By reason of the place where her was cast away. You can't get from Old\nBarn to Blackmarsh lane with wheels, sir, any way, can you? You know how\nthat is, Doctor Jemmy.\"\n\n\"Certainly I do. But that proves nothing to my mind at all conclusive.\"\n\n\"To my mind it do prove everything conclusive. And here be the sign and\nseal of it. As long as I spoke again' you, Dr. Vox, I was forced to go\nwithout my Little Billy. Not a day's work hath prospered all that time,\nand two bad shillings from chaps as rode away. But now I be took to the\nright side again, here comes my Little Billy, and an order for three\nharries!\"\n\n\"But it was the Little Billy that has made you change sides. It came\nbefore, and not in consequence of that.\"\n\n\"And glad I be to see 'un, sir, and glad to find you clear of it. Tell\n'e what I'll do, Doctor Jemmy. You draw a table up as big as Ten\nCommandments, and three horse shoes on the top for luck, in the name of\nthe Lord, and King William the Fourth, and we'll have it on Church-door\nby next Sunday, with my mark on it, and both 'prentices. You put it up,\nsir, like Nebuchadnezzar; beginning--'I, Joseph Crang, do hereby\nconfess, confirm, and convince all honest folk of this here parish----'\"\n\n\"No, no; nothing of that, Joe. I am quite satisfied. Let people come\nround, or not; just as they like. I am having a holiday, and I find it\nvery pleasant.\"\n\n\"Meaning to say, as it have spoiled your trade? Never would I forgive a\nman as did the like to me. But I see you be going for a trip somewhere,\nsir, with a pretty lady. Only you mind one thing. Joe Crang will shoe\nyour horses, as long as you bide in Perlycrass, for the wholesale price\nof the iron, Doctor Jemmy; time, and labour, and nails thrown in, free\ngratis and for nothing.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\nCAMELIAS.\n\n\nWhile at the Old Barn, and Rectory also, matters were thus improving,\nthere was no lifting of the clouds, but even deeper gloom at\nWalderscourt. The house, that had been so gay and happy, warm and\nhospitable, brisk with pleasant indoor amusement; or eager to sally\nforth upon some lively sport, whenever the weather looked tempting; the\nhouse that had been the home of many joyful dogs--true optimists, and\ntherefore the best friends of man--and had daily looked out of its\nwindows, and admired (with noddings of pretty heads, and glances of\nbright eyes) the manner a good horse has of saying--\"by your leave, I\nwant to see a little bit of the world. Two days looking at my own\nbreath, and your nasty whitewash! It would grieve me very much to pitch\nyou off. But remember you have seventy years, and I about seventeen,\nfor seeing God's light, and the glories of the earth.\"\n\nNone of these high-mettled things happened now. If a horse had an\nairing, it was with a cloth on, and heels of no perception sticking\nunder him, like nippers; instead of the kind and intelligent approach of\na foot that felt every step, and went with it--though thankful for being\nabove the mud--or better still, that stroking of his goodness with the\ngrain, which every gentlemanly horse throws up his head to answer, when\na lady of right feeling floats upon the breeze to please him.\n\nNeither was there any dog about. Volumes of description close with a\nbang, the moment such a thing is said. Any lawn, where dogs have played,\nand any gravel-walk,--whereon they have sauntered, with keener\nobservation than even Shakespeare can have felt, or rushed with headlong\ninterest into the life-history of some visitor--lawn, and walk, and even\nflower-beds (touchy at times about sepulture of bones) wear a desolate\naspect, and look as if they are longing to cry, too late--\"Oh bark\nagain, as thou wast wont to bark!\"\n\nThe premises may not have felt it thus; or if they did, were too mute to\ntell it. But an air of desolation broods over its own breath; and\nsilence is a ghost that grows bigger at each stalk. There were no leaves\nleft, to make a little hush by dropping, as a dead man does from the\nhuman tree; for the nip of early frost had sent them down, on the night\nof their Master's funeral, to a grave more peaceful and secure than his.\nNeither had men worked over hard, to improve the state of things around\nthem. With true philosophy, they had accepted the sere and yellow leaf;\nbecause nobody came to make them sweep it up. The less a man labours,\nthe longer will he last, according to general theory; and these men\nthough plentiful, desired to last long. So that a visitor of thoughtful\nvein might form a fair table of the course of \"earth-currents,\" during\nthe last three weeks, from the state of the big lawn at Walderscourt;\nwhere Sir Thomas used to lean upon his stick, and say--\"that man is\nworking almost too hard. He looks as if he ought to have a glass of\nbeer.\"\n\nBut the gentleman, now coming up the drive, was not in the proper frame\nof mind for groundling observation. Not that he failed to look about\nhim, as if to expand or improve his mind; but the only result upon his\nnervous system was to make it work harder upon his own affairs. He was\nvisited with a depressing sense of something hanging over him--of\nsomething that must direct, and shape, the whole course of his future\nlife; and whether it might be for good or evil, he was hurrying to go\nthrough with it.\n\n\"I don't care; I don't care,\" he kept saying to himself; but that self\nwas well aware that he did care very much; as much as for all the rest\nof the world put together. \"I've a great mind to toss up about it,\" he\nsaid, as he felt a lucky sixpence in his pocket; but his sense of the\nfitness of things prevailed; so he put on a fine turn of speed, and rang\nthe bell.\n\nThe old house looked so different, and everything around so changed,\nthat our friend Fox had a weak impression, and perhaps a strong hope,\nthat the bell would prove to be out of its duty, and refuse to wag. But\nalas, far otherwise; the bell replied with a clang that made him jump,\nand seek reassurance in the flavour of his black kid glove. He had\nplenty of time to dwell fully upon that, and even write a report upon\nthe subject, ere ever door showed any loyalty to bell; and even then,\nthere was stiffness about it. For one of the stiffest of mankind stood\nthere, instead of the genial John, or Bob--Mr. Binstock himself, a tall\nman of three score, Major of the cellar, and commander of the household.\nHe, in a new suit of black, and bearing a gold chain on his portly\nfront, looked down upon the vainly upstanding Jemmy, as if in need of an\nintroduction.\n\nBut Dr. Fox was not the man to cave in thus. The door was a large one,\nwith broad aperture; and this allowed the visitor to march in, as if he\nhad failed to see the great Binstock. Taking his stand upon a leopard's\nskin, in the centre of the entrance hall, he gazed around calmly, as if\nhe were the stranger contemplated by the serving-man.\n\n\"You will have the goodness to take this card up. No thank you, my man,\nI will stay where I am.\"\n\nThe butler's face deepened from the tint of a radish to that of the\nrichest beet-root; but he feared to reply, and took the card without a\nword. \"My turn will come very soon,\" was in his eyes.\n\nAcquainted as he was with the domestic signs and seasons, Fox had not a\nshadow of a doubt about his fate, so far as the lady of the house could\npronounce it. But for all that he saw no reason to submit to rudeness;\nand all his tremors vanished now at this man's servile arrogance. How\nmany a time had that fat palm borne the impress of a five-shilling\npiece, slipped into it by the sympathetic Jemmy! And now, to think that\nthis humbug did not know him, and looked at him as a young man aiming at\nthe maids, but come to the wrong door! If anything is wormwood to an\nEnglishman,--that a low, supercilious, ungrateful lacquey--well, here he\ncomes again! Now for it.\n\nBinstock descended the old oak staircase, in a very majestic manner,\nwith the light from a long quarled window playing soft hop-scotch, upon\nhis large countenance. The young doctor, as in absent mood, felt\ninterest in the history, value, and probable future, of the beings on\nthe panels,--stags, otters, foxes, martens, polecats, white hares,\nbadgers, and other noble members of West county suffrage; some entire,\nand too fat to live, some represented by a very little bit.\n\nBinstock descended, in deep silence still. He felt that the crown had\npassed away. No other five-shilling piece would ever flutter--as a tip\non the sly should have the wings to do--from the gentleman of phials, to\nthe man of bottles.\n\nThe salver in his hand was three times as large as the one upon which he\nhad received the card; but the little card was on it, very truly in the\ncentre, squaring the circle of a coat of many arms.\n\nThe butler came down, and brought his heels together; then made a low\nbow, and without a word, conveyed to the owner of that piece of\npasteboard, how frankly and cordially it lay at his disposal. Fox had\nbeen expecting at least some message, some shade, however cold it might\nbe, of courtesy and acknowledgment. But this was a queer sort of\nreception. And Binstock did not even grin. The turn of his lips\nsuggested only, that others might do so--not he, at such a trifle.\n\nFox should have taken all, with equal silence. The Foxes were quite as\nold a race as any Waldrons; Foxden was a bigger place than Walderscourt;\nand stouter men than Binstock were in service there. But the young man\nwas in love; and he forgot those spiteful things.\n\n\"No message, Binstock?\" He asked with timid glance, while he fumbled\nvery clumsily with his nails (now bitten short, during many sad hours of\ndark brooding) to get his poor card out of graven heraldry--\"not a word\nof any sort, from--from anybody?\"\n\n\"Had there been a message, sir, I should have delivered it.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, Binstock. To be sure--of course, you would. Very\nwell. Good afternoon. There is nothing more to say. I will put this in\nmy pocket, for--for a last remembrance.\"\n\nHe put the rejected card in his waistcoat-pocket, and glanced round, as\nif to say \"Good bye,\" to the old haunt of many a pleasant hour.\n\nThen Binstock, that grave and majestic butler, surprised him by giving a\nmost unmajestic wink. Whether he was touched with reminiscence of his\nyouth--for he had been a faithful man, in love, as well as wine--or\nwhether sweeter memory of crown-pieces moved him; from sympathy, or\ngratitude, or both combined, beyond any question, Binstock winked. Fox\nfelt very thankful, and received a lasting lesson, that he had not given\nutterance to the small contempt within him.\n\n\"There was a little pipe, sir,\" said the butler, glancing round, and\nspeaking in a low voice rather fast, \"That our poor Sir Thomas gived to\nyou, from the Spanish, now called the provincial war. John Hutchings\nmade the observation, that he had heard you pronounce opinion that it\nwas very valuable; and never would you part with it, high or low. And\nJohn says that to his certain knowledge now, it is lying in our Camelia\nhouse.\"\n\n\"Oh never mind about it now. It is kind of you to think of it. Perhaps\nyou will put it by for me.\"\n\n\"Moreover John was a-saying, sir,\" continued Mr. Binstock, with a still\nmore solemn wink, \"that you ought almost to have a look at our poor\nlittle dog, that all the parish is so full of, including our Miss\nNicie, sir. Vets may be all very well in their way; but a human doctor\nmore immortal. And that makes the young lady so particular no doubt, to\nkeep her in the Camelia house, because of being cool and warm, sir.\"\n\n\"Oh to be sure! That poor dear little _Jess_! What a fine heart you\nhave, Binstock! I suppose I may go out that way?\"\n\n\"The same to you, sir;\" said Binstock, as he proved the truth of the\nproverb--\"a fine heart is a vein of gold.\" \"The shortest way out, sir,\nJohn always says, when her ladyship's nerves have locked her up. And the\nquietest way, with no one about, unless it should happen to be Miss\nNicie, certainly is through the west quarry door.\"\n\nThe butler closed the front door with a bang, as if he had thrust the\nintruder forth; while Jemmy, with his heart in his mouth, hurried down\nthe west corridor to the Greenhouse.\n\nColonel Waldron, while in Portugal, five and twenty years ago, had been\ngreatly impressed with the glorious sight of noble Camelia-trees in full\nbloom, a sight perhaps unequalled in the world of flowers. He had vowed\nthat if ever he returned alive, and could afford the outlay, Camelias he\nwould have in England; not so magnificent of course, but worthy to\nremind him of Parque da Pena. He had studied the likings of the race,\nand built a house on purpose for them; and here they were in this dark\nmonth, beginning to offer bright suggestion of the Spring. Fine trees of\ntwenty years' sturdy growth, flourishing in the prime flush of health,\nwith the dark leaves glancing like bulls'-eyed glass, and the younger\nones gleaming like gauffered satin. And these but a cushion, and a\ncontrast, for the stately luxuriance of blossom; some in the perfect\nrosette already, of clean-cut, snow-white ivory; some just presenting\nthe pure deep chalice; others in the green bud, tipped with snow, or\nsoft maiden blush, or lips of coral.\n\nFor the trees were planted in a border of good sod, cut from healthy\npasture; instead of being crammed and jammed in pots, with the roots\nlike a ganglion, or burr-knot wen. Hence the fibres spread, and sucked\nup strength, and poured the lush juices into elastic cells, ready to\nflow into grace of form and colour, and offer fair delight, and pride,\nto the eyes and heart of watchful men.\n\nBut Fox was not a watchful man at all of any of the charming feats of\nvegetation now. Flowers were all very well in their way; but they were\nnot in his way just at present, or--worse again--some of them were, and\nstopped him from clear view of something worth all the flowers, all the\nfruit, and all the fortunes of the wide wide world.\n\nFor lo, not far away, betwixt a pink tree and a white one, sat Miss Inez\nWaldron, in a square-backed garden chair. At her feet was a cushioned\nbasket, with an invalid dog asleep in it; while a sound dog, of pug\nrace, was nudging in between, fain to push it out of sight, if his body\nhad been big enough. Jealousy lurked in every wrinkle of his face, and\ngoverned every quiver of his half-cocked tail.\n\nThe girl looked very pale and sad, and could not even raise a smile, at\nall the sharp manoeuvres and small-minded whines of _Pixie_. Heartily as\nshe loved the dogs, their sorrows, views, and interests now were not the\nfirst she had to dwell on. With the colour gone from her cheeks, and her\nlarge deep-gray eyes dulled with weeping, her face was not so lovely as\nin gayer times, but even yet more lovable and tender.\n\nFollowing _Pixie's_ rush, without much expectation in her gaze--for she\nthought it was her mother coming--her eyes met those of the young man,\nparted by such a dark cloud from her. For an instant her pale cheeks\nflushed, and then the colour vanished from them, and she trembled so\nthat she could not rise. Her head fell back on the rail of the chair;\nwhile trees, and flowers, and lines of glass began to quiver, and lose\ntheir shape, and fade away from her languid eyes.\n\n\"You are faint--she has fainted!\" cried Fox in dismay, as he caught up\nthe handkerchief she had dropped, and plunged it into a watering pot,\nthen wrung and laid it gently on her smooth white forehead. Then he took\nboth her hands in his, and chafed them, kneeling at her side in a state\nof agitation, unlikely to add to his medical repute. And from time to\ntime, he whispered words, of more than sympathy or comfort, words that\nhad never passed between them yet.\n\nFor a while she knew not what he said, until as she slowly revived, one\nword attracted her vague attention.\n\n\"Happy!\" she said, only conscious yet of speaking to some kind person;\n\"no, I must never think of such a thing again.\" The sadness of her own\nvoice told upon her, reacting on the sad heart from which it came. She\nlooked, as if for somebody to comfort her; perhaps the dear father who\nhad always loved to do it. He was not to be found--oh, piteous grief! If\nhe could come, would he ever leave her thus?\n\nThen the whole of her misery broke upon her. She knew too well where she\nwas, and what. Turn away the face there is none to kiss, and toss back\nthe curls there is nobody to stroke. From a woman, she fell back into a\npetted child, spoiled by sweet love, and now despoiled by bitter fate.\nShe could look at nothing more. Why did consciousness come back? The\nonly thing for her was to sob, and weep--tears that rolled more big and\nheavy, because they must ever roll in vain.\n\nFox had never been in such a state of mind before. Hundreds of times he\nhad been driven to the end of his wits, and the bottom of his heart, to\nknow what to do with wailing women, stricken down at last by inexorable\ndeath, from the hope that laughs at doctors. But the difference was\nthis--he was the doctor then; and now he was the lover. The lover,\nwithout acknowledged right to love; but the shadow of death, and worse\nthan that, betwixt him and the right to love.\n\nWhile he was feebly holding on, knowing that he could not leave her\nthus--for there was a large tank near her--yet feeling that no man--save\nhusband, or father--should be admitted to this deep distress, he heard\nthe light steps of a woman in the corridor, and he muttered--\"Thank God!\nThere is some kind person coming.\"\n\nBut his joy was premature. The branches of a fine Camelia-tree were\nswept aside like cobwebs, and there stood Lady Waldron, drawing the\nheavy black folds around her, and bearing him down with her cold dark\neyes. Her gaze of contemptuous loathing passed from him--as if he were\nnot worth it--to the helpless embodiment of anguish in the chair; and\neven then there was no pity.\n\nInez turned and faced her, and the meeting of their eyes was not of the\ngentle sweetness due betwixt a mother and her daughter. Without another\nglance at Fox, Lady Waldron swept by, as if he were not present; and\nstanding before her daughter, spoke a few Spanish words very slowly,\npronouncing every syllable. Then with a smile far worse to see than any\nfrown, she turned away, and her stately figure disappeared in the\nshadows of the corridor.\n\nThe maiden watched her without a word, and the sense of wrong renewed\nher strength. Her eyes met the light, as if they had never known a tear,\nand she threw up her head, and swept her long hair back. For her proud\nspirit rose through the storm of her trouble, as a young palm stands\nforth from the cloud it has defied. She cast a glance at Fox, and to her\ngreat relief saw nothing in his face but anxiety about herself. But she\nmust have his ignorance confirmed.\n\n\"What trouble I have given you!\" she said, with her usual clear soft\ntones, and gentle look. \"I am quite ashamed of myself, for having so\nvery little strength of mind. I cannot thank you as I ought to do. My\nmother would have done it, I--I suppose at least, if she had been at all\nlike herself. But she has not been well, not at all as she used to be,\never since--I need not tell you what. We are doing our best to bear\nthings; but we find it very, very hard. As the Spanish proverb is--but I\nbeg your pardon, you don't know Spanish?\"\n\n\"I am nothing of a linguist. I am no exception to the general rule of\nEnglishmen, that their own tongue is enough for them.\"\n\n\"Please to tell me plainly. My memory seems confused. But I think you\nhave shown some knowledge of it. And I think, I have heard my father say\nthat you could read Don Quixote very fairly from his copy.\"\n\n\"No; but just a little, very badly, and with the help of a dictionary,\nand my own recollection of Latin.\"\n\n\"Then you know what my mother said just now? I hope not. Oh I should\ngrieve so!\"\n\n\"Well, Miss Waldron, if you insist upon the truth, I cannot deny that I\nunderstood her.\"\n\nNicie's eyes flashed as he spoke: then she rose, and went to him\nhastily; for he was going, and had taken up his hat to leave her,\ninasmuch as she now could take care of herself.\n\n\"Put down your hat,\" she said in her own pretty style of issuing orders,\nin the days of yore; \"now give me both your hands, as you held mine just\nnow, and look at me honestly, and without reserve.\"\n\n\"All that I am doing,\" answered Jemmy Fox, happy to have her so, and\nthrowing the dawn of a smile into the depth of her dear eyes. \"Miss\nWaldron, I am doing it.\"\n\n\"Then go on like this--'Miss Waldron,' or you may even for once say,\n'Nicie--I have never been base enough, for a moment, to imagine that you\nhad any doubt of me.' Say all that from the bottom of your heart.\"\n\n\"Nicie, I say from the bottom of my heart, that I knew you were too\nnoble to have any doubt of me, in that way.\"\n\n\"I should hope so;\" she said, as she dropped her eyes, for fear of\nshowing all that was in them. \"You have done me justice, and it will be\ndone to you. I was only afraid, though I knew better, that you\nmight--for men are not like us----\"\n\n\"No, they are not. And more shame for them. Oh Nicie, what do I care\nnow, if the whole world goes against me?\"\n\nShe gave him one steadfast look, as if that recklessness had no shock\nfor her, and in fact had been duly expected. Then knowing by the eyes\nwhat had been nursing in her heart for months, she smiled the smile that\nis deeper almost in the human kind than tears, and happily more lasting.\nThe young man proved himself worthy of her, by cherishing it, without a\nword.\n\n\"I may never see you again,\" said Nicie, coming back to proper form,\nthough they both knew that was humbug; \"never again, or not for years.\nIt will be impossible for you now to come--to come, as you used to do.\nBut remember, if it is any comfort to you, and I think it will be a\nlittle, that no one is more miserable about this wicked, wicked charge,\nthan the one who has more right than any--yes much more than she\nhas\"--and she waved her hand after her mother's steps.\n\n\"Yes. Or at any rate quite as much. Darling, darling Nicie dear. Don't\nget excited again, for my sake.\"\n\n\"I am not excited. And I don't mean to be. But you are welcome to tell\neverybody, everybody, Jemmy, exactly what I think of you. And my dear\nfather thought the same.\"\n\n\"You are an angel, and nothing less. Something considerably more, I\nthink,\" said Jemmy, confining himself to moderation.\n\n\"Hush!\" she replied, though not in anger; for ladies like that\ncomparison. And then, as he could not better it, he whispered, \"God\nbless you, dear, as you have blessed me!\" Before she could answer, he\nwas gone.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\nCONCUSSION.\n\n\nAll the time these things were going on, the patient Christie had been\nwaiting, or rather driving to and fro, on the outskirts of the private\ngrounds. These were large, and well adorned with trees of ancient\ngrowth, and clumps of shrubs, and ferny dingles. Southward stretched the\nrich Perle valley, green with meadows beloved by cows, who expressed\ntheir fine emotions in the noblest cream; on the north-east side was the\nBeacon Hill, sheltering from the bitter winds, and forming a goodly\nlandmark; while to the north and west extended heathery downs with sweet\nshort grass, knolls of Scotch fir here and there, and gorse for ever\nblooming. Across these downs, and well above the valley-margin ran one\nof the two great western roads, broad and smooth as a ball-room floor,\nand ringing some forty times a day, with the neigh, and the tramp, and\nthe harness-rattle of four steeds tossing their heads up, and the\nmusical blast of long brass horn, or merry notes of key-bugle.\n\nChristie Fox in her own opinion was an exceedingly fine whip.\nTandem-driving was then much in vogue; and truly to be a good\ntandem-whip was one of the loftiest aspirations of the rational being\nwho could afford it. Christie was scarcely up to that mark yet, although\nshe had been known to \"tool a team,\" when her father had the gout, and\nthere was some one at her side. So it may be supposed, with what sweet\ncontempt her sparkling eyes regarded Churchwarden Tarrant's rattle-trap,\nand his old cob Punch anteceding it.\n\n\"Now don't you go capering about, Miss Chris;\" her brother had said when\nhe left her. \"I should have brought George, or at any rate the boy.\nThese lanes are so narrow, and the ditches such a depth.\"\n\n\"Well, Jemmy, it shows how little you have been at home! Why I can drive\nSparkler, and Wild-oats, and Hurricane. To think of my coming to grief\nwith this old screw!\"\n\n\"You are a wonder, no doubt. But at any rate, be careful. He is a quiet\nold buffer, but he has got a temper of his own. Why he upset the\nReverend, last summer.\"\n\n\"He won't spill me, I can tell him that. The Reverend is a muff--he\nshould have let him say his prayers.\"\n\nFor a long time the young lady proved that she was right. _Punch_ went\nup and down, and even on the common, as grave as a Judge, and as steady\nas a Church. \"Poor old chap!\" said Christie to him; \"Why you haven't got\nthe pluck to call your soul your own.\" _Punch_ only replied with a whisk\nof his tail, as if to say--\"well, I can call this my own,\" and pursued\nhis reflections, with a pensive head.\n\nBut suddenly the scene changed. A five-barred gate was flung mightily\nopen, half across the lane, with a fierce creak of iron, and a shivering\nof wood; and out poured a motley crowd of all sorts and sizes, rattling\ntea-kettles, and beating frying-pans, blowing old cow's horns, and\nflourishing a blown dozen of Bob Jake's bladders, with nuts inside them.\n_Punch_ was coming past, in a moody state of mind, down upon his luck in\nsome degree, and wondering what the world was made for, if a piece of\niron in a horse's mouth was allowed to deny him the Almighty's gift of\ngrass. However he resigned himself about all that.\n\nBut when this tremendous uproar broke upon him--for it happened to be\nthe Northern party of the parish, beating bounds towards the back of\nBeacon Hill, and eager to win a bet about where they met the other\nlot--and when a gate was flung almost into his shaky knees, which had\nbegun for some time to \"come over,\" up rose the spirit of his hunting\ndays, for he had loved the hounds, when he was young. There was no room\nto rise the gate; or perhaps he would have tried it, for the mettle of\nspringier times sprang up, and he had never heard a louder noise, in the\nmost exciting burst. Surely his duty was at least to jump a hedge.\n\nHe forgot altogether that he stood between two shafts, and that a young\nlady was entrusted to his care. Swerving to the off-side, he saw a\ncomely gap, prepared no doubt by Providence, for the benefit of a horse\nnot quite so young as he used to be. And without hesitation he went at\nit, meaning no harm, and taking even less heed of the big ditch on this\nside of it. Both shafts snapped, though of fine lance-wood, the\nfour-wheeler became two vehicles, each with a pair of wheels to it, and\nover the back flew Christie, like a sail blown out of the bolt-ropes.\n\nLuckily she wore large bell-sleeves, as every girl with self-respect was\nthen compelled to do; and these, like parachutes expanding, broke the\nfull speed of her headlong flight. Even so it must have fared very badly\nwith her--for her hat being stringless had flown far away--had she been\nallowed to strike the earth; but quicker than thought a very active\nfigure sprang round the head of the gate, and received the impact of her\nhead upon a broad staunch breast. The blow was severe, and would have\nknocked the owner down, had he not been an English yeoman.\n\nUpon a double-breasted waistcoat, made of otter skin, soft and elastic,\nhe received the full brunt of the young lady's head, as the goal-keeper\nstops a football. Throwing forward his arms, he was just in time to\ncatch more of her, as it descended; and thus was this lovely maiden\nsaved from permanent disfigurement, if not from death. But for the time,\nshe knew nothing of this.\n\nFrank Gilham held her very firmly in his arms, and wondered, as well he\nmight do, at her good fortune and his own. Others came crowding round\nthe gate, but none had the least idea who she was, and Gilham would not\npermit one of them to touch her, though many would gladly have shared\nhis load. Throughout all history, it has been the nature of the British\nyeoman to bear his own burden, be it good or be it evil.\n\n\"Her be crule doiled,\" \"A' vear her neck be bracken,\" \"Look e' zee what\npurty hair her hath!\" \"Vetch a drap watter,\" \"Carr' un up to big 'ouze,\"\n\"Her be scrunched like a trummot\"--in this way they went on, all gaping\nand staring, eager to help, but not sure of the way.\n\n\"Lift the gate from its hinges, and lay it down here;\" said Gilham, for\nshe still remained senseless; \"run to yon rick--they've been hay-binding\nthere; bring a couple of trusses, and spread them on the gate.\"\n\nIn two minutes Christie was lying on the gate--for Devonshire men can be\nquick when they like--bedded and pillowed among sweet hay, with Frank\nGilham's coat spread across her pretty dress, and his hand supporting\nher fair head, and easing the jerks as they bore her up the road. But\nbefore they had gone more than ten or twenty yards towards Walderscourt,\nwhom should they come upon but Dr. Jemmy Fox, looking very joyful, until\nhe met them?\n\n\"My sister! My own dear Chris!\" he exclaimed; and they fell away, while\nhe examined her.\n\n\"Concussion. Only slight, I hope. Thank God!\" he said, with his eyes\nfull of tears; \"keep her head like that, I will take this end; now, who\nthe other? But not to the Court--anywhere but that. Never mind why. I\ncan't stop to explain. What is the nearest house, this other way?\"\n\n\"Mother's is not more than half a mile away, and good level road,\"\nanswered Gilham. \"She'd be well-treated there. You may trust us for\nthat.\"\n\n\"You are a brick. Take the other end, Frank. Some fellow with good legs\nrun in front, and tell Mrs. Gilham what her son has said. No crowding\nround there; we want all the air. One or two of you run and catch Mr.\nFarrant's horse before he tumbles through that harrow. The rest of you\ngo on with your beating work.\" For _Punch_ was careering across a\nploughed field, like a wrecker with his plunder at his heels.\n\nBy the time they arrived at White Post Farm, Mrs. Gilham was ready to\nreceive them, a kind old lady as ever lived, sensible, quiet, and\nready-witted. A bed on the ground-floor was ready, and poor Christie,\nwho still lay as if in a heavy sleep, was carried in very gently; and\nplaced as well as might be upon it. Sometimes she was breathing with\nlong gasps, and at other times showing no life at all, and her eyes were\nclosed as in a soft deep sleep. \"The pretty dear! The poor young thing!\"\ncried Mrs. Gilham, and a real cry it was.\n\n\"I shall not leave her till she comes to herself--that is if you will\nlet me stop,\" said her brother, who was much more anxious than he cared\nto let them see. \"But if you could send a note to my Old Barn, George\nwould come over, with a little chest I want.\"\n\n\"In twenty minutes, I will be there,\" answered Gilham, \"and back in\nanother fifteen with it, if it will come on horseback.\"\n\nHe had saddled a horse, and was off in two minutes, while Fox called\nafter him down the lane, to see on his road through Priestwell whether\nDr. Gronow was at home, and beg him to come up if possible.\n\nGronow came at once, when called; for if anything is remarkable among\nthe professors of the healing art (beyond their inability to heal) it is\nthe good-will with which they always try their best, and the largeness\nof their ministrations to each other's families. Parsons appeal to one\nanother for a leg-up very freely; but both reading-desk and pulpit feel\nthat the strange foot is not up to much, unless it has its footing paid.\n\nBut Dr. Gronow (besides the kindness of his kind profession, always at\nthe service of its members) had an especial regard for Fox, as a young\nman much of his own type, one who dared to think for himself, and being\nthoroughly well-grounded, often felt impatient at the vast uncertainty\nabove. Whatever faith a young man may feel in his own powers of\nperception, it is a happy moment, when a veteran confirms him.\n\n\"She will be all right,\" said the man of long practice, after careful\nexamination; \"only she must have her time, which you know as well as I\ndo. Never mind if she lies like this, for twelve or even for twenty-four\nhours; though I do not think that it will last so long. She ought to\nhave a face she knows and loves, to meet her own, when her\nconsciousness returns. Then you know how to treat her. _Verbum sat._ But\nI want to have a long talk with you, when this anxiety is over. Why have\nyou kept so long out of my way? Come down to my house, when your sister\ncan spare you.\"\n\nFox would have found it hard to say, or at any rate to tell Gronow, what\nwere his reasons for avoiding Priestwell, while the present black cloud\nhung over him. In fact to himself his own motives had not been very\nclear or well considered; but pride was perhaps the foremost. If Gronow\nintended to take his part, the first thing to do was to call at Old\nBarn, and let everybody know it. And the young man failed to recollect,\nthat the elder might have good reasons of his own, for keeping his\ndistance just at first. Nothing but kind consideration had prevented\nGronow from calling upon Fox straightway, for he knew what significance\npeople would attach to such a visit. Suspicion had fallen upon him as\nwell; and many of the baser sort declared, that old and young doctor had\narranged that piece of work between them.\n\nLiberal as he was, and kind, whenever a case of real want or trouble was\nbrought before him, the retired physician was not beloved yet by his\nneighbours, and he knew it, and was well content to have it so.\n\n\"A queer old chap\"--was the usual summary of his character in the\nparish; and the charitable added, \"no call to blame him; a little bit\ntouched in the upper storey.\"\n\nTo the vast relief of her brother, and the delight of her kind hostess,\nChristie Fox that very night contrived to come to herself, almost as\nsuddenly as she had left it.\n\n\"What is all this about?\" she asked, opening her clear eyes strongly.\n\"Why, Jemmy, you have got no hat on! And where is mine? Oh dear! oh\ndear! Thirty shillings, without the trimming.\"\n\n\"There it is, dear, as large as life, and not a speck upon it. Now drink\nthis cup of tea; and then I'll finish what I was saying.\"\n\n\"No, you always talk so fast, and you never let me say a word. I might\njust as well have no tongue at all.\"\n\nThe young lady spoke in such fine ignorance of the self she had come\nback to, that there could be no doubt of her being all there. And\npresently the \"cup of tea\" had such a tranquillising power that she fell\ninto a sweet deep sleep, and did not awake until the sun was as high as\nhe meant to go at that time of the year. At first she had a slow dull\nheadache, and felt stiff all over. But Mrs. Gilham appearing with a\nnapkin'd tray, thin toast and butter, a couple of pullet's eggs just\nlaid, and one or two other brisk challenges at the hands of her youngest\ndaughter, nature arose with an open mouth to have the last word about\nit, and Christie made a famous breakfast.\n\nVery soon Dr. Gronow looked in again, and smiled in his dry way at her,\nfor he was not a man of many words. She gave her round wrist to be felt,\nand the slim pink tongue to be glanced at, and the bright little head to\nbe certified cool and sound under the curls; and passing this\nexamination with high honours, she thought him a \"very nice old man;\"\nthough his face was not at first sight perhaps of the sweet and\nbenevolent order.\n\nThen the old doctor took the young doctor aside--for Jemmy had not been\nout of hail all night--and said, \"She will do. I congratulate you. No\nserious lesion, no feverish symptoms--just a bump on her head from a\nmother-of-pearl button. But she has been severely shaken. I would not\nmove her for a day or two.\"\n\n\"May she get up?\" asked Jemmy in that spirit of pure submission, with\nwhich a doctor resigns his own family to the care of another, who knows\nperhaps less than he himself does. But the plan is wise for the most\npart, inasmuch as love is apt to cloud the clearest eyes.\n\n\"To be sure she may. It will do her good. But not to walk about yet.\nThese people are the kindest of the kind. You may safely leave all that\nto the ladies. Meanwhile you are better out of the way. Come down for an\nhour or two, and share my early dinner. You want looking to yourself.\nYou have not had a bit for some twenty-four hours.\"\n\nIt was little more than ten minutes' walk to Gronow's house at\nPriestwell, and Fox accepted the invitation gladly. Neither in the\ncourse of their walk, nor during their meal, did his entertainer refer\nto the mysterious subject, which was always in the mind of one, and\noften in that of the other. But Gronow enlarged upon his favourite\ntopic--the keen sagacity, and almost too accurate judgment possessed by\ntrout, and the very great difficulty he experienced in catching them,\nunless the stream was muddy.\n\n\"But you can't fish at this time of year,\" observed Fox; \"at least so\npeople say. I know nothing about it. Hunting and shooting are more to my\ntaste.\"\n\n\"You can fish every day in the year,\" replied Gronow; \"at any rate in\nthis river. There is nothing against it, but prejudice. The little ones\nare as bright as a new shilling now, and the old ones as a guinea.\"\n\n\"But surely they should be allowed time to breed.\"\n\n\"That is their business, and none of mine. If they choose to neglect\nwhat they should be doing, and come to my hook, why I pull them\nout--that is to say, if they don't slip off.\"\n\n\"But your hook has no right to be there just then.\"\n\n\"Is it for a fish to dictate to me, how I should employ my time? I\nbought this property for the fishing. The interest of my money runs all\nthe year round, and so must what I spent it on.\"\n\nFox saw that he would only irritate this concise logician, by further\ncontention on behalf of the fish; and he was quite disarmed, when the\ncandid doctor added--\n\n\"I don't mean to say, that such a fellow as young Pike, Penniloe's\nsenior pupil, should be allowed to fish all the year round; for he never\ngoes out without catching something. But my case is different; the\nwinter owes me all the blank days I had in the summer; and as they were\nnine out of every ten, I shall not have caught up the record, by the\ntime the May-fly comes back again.\"\n\n\"Then you can't do much harm now,\" thought Fox; \"and the trout will soon\nhave their revenge, my friend--a fine attack of rheumatism, well in\nseason.\"\n\n\"And now,\" said Dr. Gronow, when dinner was over, and \"red and white\nwine,\" as they were always called then, had been placed upon the table,\nnot upon a cloth, but on the dark red sheen; \"now you can smoke if you\nlike. I don't, just at present. Let us talk of all this botheration.\nWhat an idiot world it is! You are young, and will have to wag your tail\nto it. I go along, with my tail straight; like a dog who does not care\nto fight, but is ready, if it comes to that.\"\n\n\"I know pretty well how you look at things. And it is the best way, for\nthose who can afford it. Of course, I am bound to pretend not to care;\nand I keep up pretty well, perhaps. But for all that, it is not very\njolly. If my sister had not turned up, I am not sure how I should have\ngot on at all. Though Penniloe was very good, and so were several\nothers, especially Mockham. I must have a pipe, if you don't mind. It\nmakes me feel so grateful.\"\n\n\"That is something in its favour, and shows how young you still remain.\nI would cultivate the pipe more than I do; if so it would bring back my\nyouth; not for the youth--blind puppyhood--but for thinking better of my\nrace, and of myself as one of them.\"\n\n\"It is not for me to reason with you,\" Fox answered humbly, as he blew a\ngentle cloud; \"you are far above me, in every way. I am stupid enough;\nbut I always know, when I come across a stronger mind.\"\n\n\"Not a stronger, but a harder one. We will not go into that question\nnow. Reams have been written about it, and they leave us none the wiser.\nThe present point is--how are you to get out of this very nasty scrape?\"\n\n\"I don't care to get out. I will face it out. When a man knows his own\ninnocence----\"\n\n\"That is all very fine; but it won't work. Your prospects do not depend,\nI know, at all upon your profession. But for the sake of all your\nfriends, your sweet high-spirited sister, your good mother, and all your\nfamily, you must not rest upon that manly view. Your innocence may be a\ncoat of mail to yourself. But it will not shelter them.\"\n\n\"I have thought of all that. I am not so selfish. But who can prove a\nnegative?\"\n\n\"The man who can prove the positive. You will never be quit, until you\nshow who was the real perpetrator. A big word to use; for, after all,\nthe horror at such things is rather childish. The law regards it so, and\nin its strong perception of mortal rights, has made it a felony to steal\nthe shroud, to steal the body an indictable offence, to be punished\nwith fine, or (if a poor man did it) with imprisonment.\"\n\n\"Is that the law? I could scarcely have believed it. And they talk of\nthe absurdities of our profession!\"\n\n\"Yes, that is the law. And perhaps you see now, why your enemies have\nnot gone further. They see that it damns you ten times more, to lie\nunder the imputation, than it would to be brought to trial, and be\nacquitted, as you must be. You have not to thank them for any mercy,\nonly for knowing their own game.\"\n\n\"It is enough to make one a misanthrope for life,\" said Fox, looking\nreally fierce once more. \"I hoped that they had found their mistake\nabout me, and were sorry for accusing an innocent man.\"\n\n\"Alas for the credulity of youth! No Jemmy, the Philistines are upon\nthee. You have to reckon with a wily lot, and an implacable woman behind\nthem. They will take every advantage of the rank cowardice of the\nclodhopper, and the terror of all those pitch-plaster tales. You know\nhow these things have increased, ever since that idiotic Act of two or\nthree years back. That a murderer should be prevented even from\naffording some posthumous expiation! And yet people call it a religious\nage--to rob a poor wretch of his last hope of heaven!\"\n\n\"Your idea is a grim one;\" answered Fox with a smile; \"I never saw it in\nthat light before. But now tell me one thing--and it is a main point.\nYou know that you can trust me with your opinion. I confess that I am at\nmy wits' ends. The thing must have been done, to solve some doubt. There\nis no one about here who would dare the risk, even if there were any one\nzealous enough; and so far as I know, short of Exeter, there are none\nbut hum-drums, and jog-trots.\"\n\n\"You have expressed your opinion already a little too freely to that\neffect, Master Jemmy.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I have. But I never meant it to go round. It was young and\nsilly of me. But what I want to ask you is this--do you think it\npossible that, you know who----\"\n\n\"Harrison Gowler?\" said Dr. Gronow calmly. \"It is possible, but most\nimprobable. Gowler knew what it was, even better than you did, or I\nfrom your account of it. Introsusception is not so very rare, even\nwithout a strain, or the tendency to it from an ancient wound. Putting\naside all the risk and expense--and I know that friend Gowler sticks\nclose to his money--and dropping all the feelings of a gentleman--what\nsufficient motive could Gowler have? An enthusiastic tiro might have\nlonged to verify, etc., but not a man of his experience. He knew it all,\nas well as if he had seen it. No, you may at once dismiss that idea, if\nyou ever formed it.\"\n\n\"I never did form it. It was suggested; and all that you have said\noccurred to me. Well, I know not what to think. The mystery is hopeless.\nAll we can be certain of is, that the thing was done.\"\n\n\"Even of that I am not quite so certain. I am never sure of anything,\nunless I see it. I have come across such instances of things established\nbeyond doubt--and yet they never occurred at all. And you know what a\nset of fools these fat-chopped yokels are, when scared. Why they\nactually believe in Spring-heeled Jack, Lord Somebody, and the ten\nthousand guinea bet! And they quake in their beds, if the windows\nrattle. Look at that idiot of a blacksmith, swearing that he saw you\nwith the horse! A horse? A night-mare, or a mare's nest, I should say.\nWhy it would not surprise me a bit, if it proved that the worthy baronet\nis reposing in his grave, as calmly as his brave and warlike spirit\ncould desire. If not, it is no fault of our profession, but the result\nof some dark history, to which as yet we have no clue.\"\n\nDr. Gronow had a manner of saying things, in itself so distinct and\nimpressive, and seconded so ably by a lowering of his eyebrows, and\nwrinkling of his large steep forehead, that when he finished up with his\nmouth set close, and keen eyes fixed intently, it was hard to believe\nthat he could be wrong--supposing at least that he meant to be right.\n\n\"Well, sir,\" said the young man, strongly feeling this effect; \"you have\noften surprised me by the things you have said. And strange as they\nseemed, they have generally proved correct in the end. But as to your\nfirst suggestion, it is impossible, I fear, to think of it; after what\nat least a dozen people saw, without hurry, and in broad daylight. The\nother matter may be as you say. If so, it only makes it worse for me.\nWhat hope can I have of ever getting at the bottom of it?\"\n\n\"Time, my dear fellow, time will show. And the suspicion against you\nwill be weakening every day, if you meet it with calm disdain. You\nalready have the blacksmith's recantation--a blow in the teeth for your\nenemies. I am not exactly like your good parson, who exhorts you\ndevoutly to trust in the Lord. 'The Lord helps those who help\nthemselves,' is my view of that question. Though I begin to think highly\nof Penniloe. He was inclined to be rude about the flies I use, once or\ntwice last summer. But I shall look over that, as he has been so ill. I\nshall call and enquire for him to-morrow.\"\n\n\"But what am I to do, to help myself? It is so easy to say, 'take it\neasily.' What is the first step for me to take? I could offer rewards,\nand all that sort of thing. I could send for experienced men from\nLondon. I have written to a friend of mine there already, but have had\nno answer. I could put myself in a clever lawyer's hands. I could do a\nlot of things, no doubt, and spread the matter far and wide. But the\nfirst result would be to kill my dear father. I told you in what a\ncondition he lies.\"\n\n\"Yes. You are terribly 'handicapped' as the racing people call it.\nPenniloe's illness was much against you. So was your own absence. So\nwere several other things. But the worst of all is your father's sad\nstate. And the better he gets, the worse the danger. But for all that, I\ncan give you one comfort. I have never yet known things combine against\na man, persistently and relentlessly, if he went straight ahead at them.\nThey jangle among themselves, by and by, even as his enemies are sure to\ndo; and instead of being hunted down, he slips out between them. One\nthing I can undertake perhaps. But I won't talk of it until I know more,\nand have consulted Penniloe. What, have you never had a glass of wine?\nWell, that is too bad of me! These are the times, when even a young man\nwants it, and an old one should sympathise with him thus. Oh, you want\nto get back to the fair Miss Christie? Very well, take her half a dozen\nof my pears. These people about here don't know what a pear is,\naccording to my interpretation of the word.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\nPERCUSSION.\n\n\nThis was not the right time of year for spring of hope, and bounding\ngrowth; the first bloom-bud of the young heart growing milky, and yet\ndefiant; and the leaf-bud pricking up, hard and reckless, because it can\nnever have a family. Not the right time yet for whispered openings, and\nshy blush of petals, still uncertain of the air, and creeping back into\neach other's clasp lest they should be tempted to come out too soon.\nNeither was there in the air itself that coy, delusive, tricksome way,\nwhich it cannot help itself for having, somewhere about the month of\nApril, when the sun is apt to challenge and then shirks the brunt.\n\nIn a word (though no man can prove a negative, as Jemmy Fox had well\nremarked) it was the very time when no young man, acquainted with the\ncalendar of his Church, should dream of falling into love, even though\nhe had a waistcoat of otterskin, and fourteen pearl-buttons upon it.\n\nIn spite of all that, it was the positive which prevailed in this case.\nFrank Gilham had received such a blow upon his heart, that the season\nand the weather were nothing to it. The fall of the leaf, and retirement\nof the sap--though the Saps now tell us that it never does retire--had\nless than no effect upon his circulation. He went in vainly for a good\nday's ploughing, for he could hold as well as drive; but there was his\nwaistcoat, and his heart inside it; and even when he hung the one upon\nan oak-tree, the other kept going on, upon its private business; and\n\"Whoa! Stand still, hossy!\" had no effect upon it.\n\nHe sneaked into the house, as if he had no right there--though his\nmother had only a life-interest--and he made a serious matter of the\nshortness of his nails, and felt a conscientious longing, when he saw\nhis whiskers, to kick the barber at Pumpington, who had shorn them with\na pair of tailor's scissors, so abominably on the last market-day. But\nlast market-day, this young man's heart had been inditing of pigs and\npeas, whereof he had made a tidy penny, because he was a sharp fellow\nthen.\n\n\"How is she now?\" he asked his young sister Rose, when he came down at\nlast, discontented with himself, though appearing unusually smart to\nher.\n\n\"Well, thank you, Frank, mother is not quite the thing to-night. She did\nnot get quite her proper rest, you know, on account of the strange young\nlady. And she never took her hore-hound lozenges. She thinks too much of\nothers, and too little of herself----\"\n\n\"As if I did not know all that! Will you never tell me anything I want\nto know? But I suppose the young lady won't keep her up to-night?\"\n\n\"She? Oh she is all right enough. You should just see her eat. My\ngoodness! Talk of farmhouse appetites!\"\n\n\"Rose, who are you to understand such things? You have seen so very\nlittle of the world; and you judge it entirely by yourself. I suppose\nthe door is not open?\"\n\n\"Oh yes. Anybody can look in, if that's what you want to do. She has\nbeen sitting up ever so long, with mother's dressing-gown and Sunday\nshawl on. Such a guy you never see in all your life!\"\n\n\"A pity you can't be a guy then. Why Rose, if you only had a hundredth\npart----\"\n\n\"Yes, I dare say. But I don't want, don't you see? I am quite contented\nas I am; and better judges than you will ever be--why that coloured hair\nis quite out of fashion now. Everybody goes in for this sort of tint,\nand a leaden comb to make it darker. Corkscrews are all the rage, and\nthey can't be too black. Why Minnie Farrant told me, last Sunday, that\nshe read on the best authority----\"\n\n\"Her Bible, or her Prayer-book?\"\n\n\"Don't be so absurd. The very best authority, that Queen Adelaide\nherself told His Majesty as much, and he said he was a Tar, and the best\npitch wasn't black. That was to please her, you know. Wasn't it clever\nof him? Oh Frank, why don't you fall in love with Minnie Farrant--your\nown Godfather's favourite child, and they say she'll have four thousand\npounds?\"\n\n\"Minnie Farrant! Why, I'd rather have a broomstick. Though she is all\nvery well in her way, of course.\"\n\n\"She is the prettiest girl in this parish, by long chalks, except of\ncourse Nicie Waldron. And I suppose you wouldn't quite stick up to her.\"\n\n\"Stick up indeed! Is that the way you learn to express yourself at a\nfinishing school? But do look sharp with the frying-pan, if your\ncorkscrews are not too precious. I don't want Minnie Farrant, nor even\nMiss Waldron--I want my little bit of supper, and you know it well\nenough. I am sorry for the ninny that ever falls in love with you.\"\n\n\"So am I. Because I won't have him. But what fun it will be! I shall\nstarve him out. All you men think about is eating; and I shall say----\"\n\n\"Rose again, as usual! Her long tongue running away with her.\" Mrs.\nGilham looked very serious, for every day she found stronger proof that\ngirls were not as they used to be. \"You have had your tea, child, and\nyou want nothing more. I am sure you should be the very last to talk as\nif eating were a sin. Go and help Mary with your dear brother's supper.\nHe has been hard at work all day.\"\n\n\n     \"Sticks to his work, wants no diverting--\n       A model young man in the farming line!\n     Never goes hunting, dancing, flirting,\n       Doesn't know the flavour of a glass of wine.\"\n\n\nAway danced Rosie to the tune of her own song, with her light figure\nfrisking from side to side of the long stone passage.\n\n\"Ah me! I fear we shall have trouble yet with that very thoughtless\ngirl. She can only see the light side of everything. It is high time for\nher now; why before I was seventeen--But Frank, you don't look like\nyourself to-night!\" The old lady went up to him, and pushed aside his\nhair, as crisp and curly as a double hyacinth. \"I am almost sure, there\nis something on your mind. Your dear father had exactly that expression\nupon his face, at periods of his married life. But then it was always\nthe times when he had rheumatics in his left shoulder blade; and I used\nto iron them out with brown paper, the darkest brown that you can get,\nand a sprinkle of vinegar underneath, as hot as ever you can bear it; in\nfact, until it begins to singe, and then----\"\n\n\"Well, nobody will ever do that to me, thank God!\" Frank spoke in a very\nreckless tone, and strictly avoided his mother's eyes.\n\n\"I will, my son, if I live long enough. Old Mrs. Horner used to say--not\nthe present Mrs. John, you know, but her husband's mother----\"\n\n\"Excuse me, dear mother, but I thought I heard a call. Shall I go, and\nknock at the young lady's door?\"\n\n\"Frank, how can you ask such a question? Not that she is not in very\npretty order, and fit for any one to look at her; with my dressing-gown\non, as good as new, and the big picture-Bible on one side of her, and\n'The Fashionable Lady's Vade Mecum' on the other.\"\n\n\"How queer she must look in your dressing-gown, mother! Quite an old\nfrump, I suppose?\"\n\n\"I am very much obliged to you, my son. But as it happens, Miss Christie\nFox does not look at all like an old frump; though your poor mother\nwould of course, and must expect it--though not perhaps quite to be told\nof it. On the contrary, Miss Fox looks very bright and blooming, with\nher eyes like the sky itself, and her lovely hair flowing all down her\nshoulders.\"\n\n\"I had better go and see whether she has knocked for something. I need\nnot go in of course. In fact I should not think of it, only just to pop\nmy head inside the door, and then----\"\n\n\"No, you won't pop it, sir, in any place of the kind. Remember that it\nis a bedroom; and you are a gentleman--or ought to be.\"\n\n\"Oh, come, mother! That's a little too hard on me. I never meant\nanything, except to save you trouble, by just asking--Well, I didn't\nthink you would speak to me in that way.\"\n\n\"Well my boy, perhaps I spoke too hastily. Words turn so different,\noutside the lips! But I should not like a visitor of ours to think she\nhad fallen among savages. But here comes your supper at last; and small\nthanks to Rosie. Why at her time of life, I should have been too proud\nto serve my only brother, hand and foot. But I must just run back, and\nget my young lady tucked up. High time for her to be in bed again. Her\nbrother has sent her box full of things, and so we shall be able to get\nher out a bit to-morrow, if the weather permits, and Dr. Gronow.\"\n\nDr. Gronow permitted, and so did the weather. Can any man remember when\nhe was stopped from making a fool of himself by the weather, or\nencouraged in any wisdom by it? How many a youth under vast umbrella,\nwarranted to shelter two, if their shoulders came nice and close\ntogether, with the storm beating on them, and suggesting--but such\numbrellas are not made now, fine canopies of whalebone--who would buy\nthem? Who thinks of more than his own top-hat?\n\nUnless he sees a chance of a gold-band round it. And that, to tell the\ntruth, has been very charming always. But here was Frank Gilham, without\nany thought of that. He knew that Jemmy Fox was a fine young fellow,\nperhaps a little bit above him in the social scale, and likely to be a\nwealthy man, some day. But of sweet Christie he knew nothing, except\nthat he wanted to know a great deal.\n\nTherefore he found that the young mare was puffing, and wanted wet\nbandages, and a day in stable--excess of synovial oil is a serious\nstudy. While on the other hand old _Tommy_, as hard and as dry as a\nbrick-bat, was not altogether free from signs of rheumatism, and had\nscraped up his litter, in a manner that meant something. He put it to\nhis mother, whether they should plough to-day. It might be all right,\nand the horses were hers. If she thought wise to venture it----\n\n\"It is no use trying to persuade me, Frank,\" Mrs. Gilham answered; \"I\nwon't risk it. Your dear father lost a good horse once, although I\nadvised him to the contrary. Under Providence, our first duty is to the\nfaithful and long-suffering creatures, provided by Him for the benefit\nof mankind. You may try to persuade me, as much as you like. But you\ndon't seem to have got your ploughing trousers on!\"\n\n\"That is not a question of ten minutes. When I looked out of window,\nthe first thing this morning----\"\n\n\"Yes to be sure. You were considering the weather. Your dear father did\nthe same; though always wrong about it. But it is useless to argue with\nme, Frank. I must have my own way, sometimes.\"\n\n\"Very well. Very well, then I won't go. I have got a lot of little\nthings to see to here. Why the rack in the kitchen would soon be rack\nand ruin.\"\n\n\"Frank, you do say the very cleverest things. And I feel in myself that\nit never comes from me. Thank God that I have such a dutiful son, though\nhis mind is so superior.\"\n\nThe young man exerted his superior mind upon a very solid breakfast,\ntopped up with honey, gushing limpid from the comb, sweeter than the\nsoftest beeswing of the meed of love. Then he sauntered in the mow-yard\nwith his ginger terrier Jack; whom no wedded love could equal, in\naptitude to smell a rat. But hay was sweet, and clover sweeter, and the\nrich deep ricks of wheat--golden piles on silver straddles--showed the\nglossy stalk, and savoured of the glowing grain within. A man might\nthrust his arm into the yellow thicket here and there, and fetch the\nchined and plump ear out, and taste the concrete milkiness.\n\n\"Rose told me that I should just see her eat,\" Frank Gilham meditated;\n\"what a greedy thing to say! Was it because eggs are now so scarce, and\nRose wanted all of them for herself? But if she likes good things, I\ncould have this rick of brown wheat threshed to-morrow. The bread is ten\ntimes as sweet and toothsome--oh by the by, what teeth she has, like\nwind-flower buds among roses. Two or three times, her lips just showed\nthem, while she was lying upon that hay. But what are her teeth to\ncompare with her lips? And did anybody ever see such cheeks, even with\nthe pink flown out of them? There's nothing that you could find a flaw\nin; forehead, hair, and eyes, and nose--though I can't pretend quite\nthat I have seen her eyes yet--merely a sort of a flash in the air,\nwhile she was flying over the backrail of the trap. Only there is no\ndenying that they must be like heaven itself, full of Angels. Mother\nsays the sky, but that sounds so common. So far as that goes, everybody\nis allowed to look at the sky; but who would care ever to see it again,\nafter a glimpse--Jack, what are you about there? Got into a gin? Well,\nserves you right for mooning.\"\n\n\"Frank! Frank! Frank!\" A loud call rang among the ricks. \"Got away\nsmoking again, I'll be bound. I never can understand how it is, he\ndoesn't set every blessed rick on fire.\"\n\n\"Not smoking at all, as it happens. But how frightfully shrill your\nvoice is, Rosie!\"\n\n\"What a swell we are, to be sure, to-day! And getting quite nervous.\nWants cotton wool in his ears, poor dear! But the precious young lady is\njust coming out. And mother says you should be somewhere handy, in case\nof her being taken faint. About as likely to faint as I am, I should\nsay. Now mind your P's and Q's, in spite of all your Greek and Latin.\nYou may make your bow, about ten miles off; but not to speak, until\nspoken to. That's right, flourish your hair up. But you needn't run\ntwenty miles an hour.\"\n\nOn the gravel walk bordered by hollyhocks--now a row of gaunt sceptres\nwithout any crowns--the kind Mrs. Gilham was leading her guest, who did\nnot require to be led at all, but was too well-bred to reject the\nfriendly hand. Christie was looking a little delicate, and not quite up\nto the mark of her usual high spirits; but the man must have been very\nhard to please, who could find much fault on that score.\n\n\"Oh what a beautiful view you have!\" she exclaimed, as the sun broke\nthrough the mist, spreading Perle valley with a veil of purest pearl. \"I\nhad no idea it was such a lovely place. And the house, and the garden,\nand the glen that slopes away. Why that must be Perlycross tower in the\ndistance, and that tall white house the rectory. Why, there's the bridge\nwith seven lofty arches, and the light shining through them! More light\nthan water, I should say. What on earth induced them to put such a\nmighty bridge across such a petty river? I dare say they knew best--but\njust look at the meadows, almost as green as they would be in May! No\nwonder you get such lovely butter. And the trees down the valley, just\nin the right places to make the most of themselves, and their\nneighbourhood. Why half of them have got their leaves on still, here\nnearly at the end of November--and such leaves too, gold, red, and\namber, straw-colour, cinnamon, and russet!\"\n\n\"And if you come up to that bench, my dear,\" replied Mrs. Gilham, as\nproud as Punch, at the praises of her native vale, \"that bench at the\ntop of our little orchard--my poor dear husband had such taste, he could\nfind the proper place for everything--gravel-walk all the way, and\nnothing but a little spring to cross; why, there you can hear the\nkey-bugle of the _Defiance_! Punctual every day at half-past ten. We\nalways set our kitchen clock by it. The Guard, as soon as he sees our\nmiddle chimney, strikes up as loud as ever he can blow, 'Oh the\nroast-beef of Old England,' or 'To glory we steer,' for the horses to be\nready. So some people say; but I happen to know, that it is done\nentirely to please us. Because we sent cider out every day, when that\nhot week was, last summer.\"\n\n\"What a grateful man! Oh I must go and hear him. I do think there's\nnothing like gratitude. By the by, I am not acting up to that. I have\nnever even seen your son, to thank him.\"\n\n\"Oh Miss Fox, it is not fair to him, for any young lady to try to do\nthat. He has no opinion of anything he does; and the last time he saved\na young lady's life, he ran away, because--because it wouldn't do to\nstay. You see, she had been at the very point of drowning, and the\npeople on the bank declared that she came up three times. My son Frank\nnever pulled his coat off--he would have despised himself, if he had\nstopped to do it--he jumped in, they said it was forty feet high, but\nthere is no bank on the river (except the cliff the church stands on)\nmuch over five and twenty. However, in he went, and saved her; and\neverybody said that she was worth \u00c2\u00a310,000, but carried away by the\ncurrent. And from that day to this, we heard nothing more about it; and\nmy son, who has a very beautiful complexion, blushes--oh he blushes so,\nif he only hears of it!\"\n\n\"Oh, he is too good, Mrs. Gilham! It is a very great mistake, with the\nworld becoming all so selfish. But I am not the young lady that went\nwith the current. I go against the current, whenever I find any. And\nyour son has had the courage to do the same, in the question of my dear\nbrother. I say what I mean, you must understand, Mrs. Gilham. I am not\nat all fond of shilly-shally.\"\n\n\"Neither is my son, Miss Fox. Only he thinks so very little of himself.\nWhy there he is! Hard at work as usual. Don't say a syllable of thanks,\nmy dear; if he comes up to pull his hat off. He can stand a cannon-ball;\nbut not to be made much of.\"\n\n\"Won't I though say 'thank you' to him? I am bound to consider myself,\nand not only his peculiar tendencies. Mr. Frank Gilham, do please to\ncome here, if--I mean supposing you can spare just half-a-minute.\"\n\nFrank had a fair supply of hard, as well as soft, in his composition. He\nwas five and twenty years old, or close upon it, and able to get a dog\nout of a trap, in the deepest of his own condition. He quitted his\nspade--which he had found, by the by, left out all night, though the\nsame is high treason--as if he could scarcely get away from it, and\ncould see nothing so fine as a fat spit of sod. And he kept his eyes\nfull upon Christie's, as if he had seen her before, but was wondering\nwhere.\n\nThis was the proper thing to do. Though he knew himself to be in no\nsmall fright, throughout all this bravery. But there is no monopoly of\nhumbug; though we all do our utmost to establish one.\n\n\"Miss Fox, I believe you have seen my son before.\" The old lady took to\nthe spirit of the moment, with the quickness, in which ladies always\ntake the front. \"And my son Frank has had the honour of seeing you.\"\n\n\"And feeling me too--pretty sharp against his chest\"--Christie thought\nwithin herself, but she only said--\"Yes; and it was a happy thing for\nme.\"\n\n\"Not at all, Miss Fox--a mere casual accident, as the people about here\nexpress it. I explained to you, that Frank cannot help himself. Be kind\nenough not to speak of it.\"\n\n\"That won't do,\" replied Christie, looking stedfast. \"It may do for him,\nbut not for me. Allow me one moment, Mrs. Gilham.\"\n\nWithout more ado, she ran up to Frank Gilham, who was turning away\nagain towards his work, and gave him both hands, and looked full at him,\nwith the glitter of tears in her deep blue eyes.\n\n\"My senses have not quite forsaken me,\" she said: \"and I know whom I\nhave to thank for that: and in all probability for my life as well. It\nis useless to talk about thanking you, because it is impossible to do\nit. And even before that I was deeply in your debt, for the very noble\nway in which you took my brother's part, when everybody else was against\nhim. It was so brave and generous of you.\"\n\nIt was more than she could do, with all her spirit, to prevent two large\nand liberal tears from obeying the laws of nature; in fact they were not\nfar from obtaining the downright encouragement of a sob, when she\nthought of her poor brother.\n\n\"Well, you are a sweet simple dear!\" exclaimed the fine old lady,\nfollowing suit in the feminine line, and feeling for her\npocket-handkerchief. \"Frankie should be proud to his dying day, of doing\nany trifle for such a precious dear. Why don't you say so, Frankie, my\nson?\"\n\n\"Simply because my mother has said it so much better for me.\" He turned\naway his eyes, in fear of looking thus at Christie, lest they should\ntell her there was no one else in the world henceforth for them to see.\n\n\"Here comes the _Defiance_! Hurrah, hurrah!\" shouted Rose, rushing in,\nfor once just at the right moment. \"I can hear the horses' hoofs\nspringing up the rise. If you want to know anything about roast beef,\nyou must put on a spurt up the periwinkle walk. Here goes number one.\nSlow coaches come behind.\"\n\n\"I am not a slow coach. At least I never used to be,\" cried Christie,\nsetting off in chase.\n\n\"Miss Fox, Miss Fox, don't attempt to cross the brook, without my son's\nhand,\" Mrs. Gilham called after them; for she could not live the pace.\n\"Oh Rose is wrong as usual--it's 'To glory we steer,' this time.\"\n\nThe obliging guard gave it three times over, as if he had this team also\nin full view; then he gave the \"Roast beef,\" as the substance of the\nglory; and really it was finer than a locomotive screech.\n\nPresently Rose heard the cackle of a pullet which had laid, and off she\nran to make sure of the result, because there was an old cock sadly\naddicted to the part that is least golden in the policy of Saturn. So\nthe three who remained sat upon the bench and talked, with the cider\napples piled in pink and yellow cones before them, and the mossy\nbranches sparkling (like a weeping smile) above, and the sun glancing\nshyly, under eaves and along hedgerows, like the man denied the\nprivilege of looking at the horse. By this light however Frank Gilham\ncontrived to get many a peep round his mother's bonnet--which being of\nthe latest fashion was bigger than a well-kept hedgerow--at a very\nlovely object on the other side thereof, which had no fear as yet of\nbeing stolen.\n\nMiss Fox had fully made up her mind, that (happen what might) she would\nnot say a single word, to sadden her good hostess with the trouble her\nbrother had fallen into, or the difficulties now surrounding him. But\nladies are allowed to unmake their minds, especially if it enlarges\nthem; and finding in the recesses of that long bonnet a most sympathetic\npair of ears, all the softer for being \"rather hard of hearing,\" and\nenriched with wise echoes of threescore years, she also discovered how\nwrong and unkind it would be, to withhold any heart-matter from them.\n\n\"And one of the most dreadful things of all,\" Christie concluded with a\nlong-drawn sigh, \"is that my dear father, who has only this son Jemmy,\nis now in such a very sad state of health, that if he heard of this it\nwould most likely take him from us. Or if he got over it, one thing is\ncertain, he would never even look at my brother again. Not that he would\nbelieve such a wicked thing of him; but because he would declare that he\nbrought it on himself, by going (against his father's wishes) into this\nmedical business. My father detests it; I scarcely know why, but have\nheard that he has good reason. We must keep this from him, whatever it\ncosts us; even if it keeps poor Jemmy under this cloud for months to\ncome. Luckily father cannot read now very well, and his doctor has\nordered him not to read at all; and mother never looks at a newspaper:\nand the place being five and thirty miles away, and in another county,\nthere is no great risk, unless some spiteful friend should rush in, to\ncondole with him. That is what I dread to hear of sometimes; though good\nDr. Freeborn, who attends him, will prevent any chance of it, if\npossible. But you see, Mrs. Gilham, how it cripples us. We cannot move\nboldly and freely, as we ought, and make the thing the topic of the\ncounty; as we should by an action of libel for instance, or any strong\nmode of vindication. I assure you, sometimes I am ready to go wild, and\nfly out, and do anything. And then I recollect poor father.\"\n\n\"It is a cruel cruel thing, my dear. I never heard of anything\nresembling it before. That's the very thing that Frank says. From the\nvery first he saw what a shameful thing it was to speak so of Dr. Fox. I\nbelieve he has knocked down a big man or two; though I am sure I should\nbe the last to encourage him in that.\"\n\n\"Come, mother, come! Miss Fox, you must not listen to a quarter of what\nmother says about me. I dare say, you have found that out, long ago.\"\n\n\"If so, it is only natural, and you deserve it;\" this Hibernian verdict\nwas delivered with a smile too bright to be eclipsed by a score of\nhedgerow bonnets; \"but there is one thing I should like to ask Mr. Frank\nGilham, with his mother's leave; and it is this--how was it that you Mr.\nFrank, almost alone of all the parish of Perlycross, and without knowing\nmuch of my brother at the time, were so certain of his innocence?\"\n\n\"Because I had looked in his face;\" replied Frank, looking likewise into\nthe sister's face, with a gaze of equal certainty.\n\n\"That is very noble,\" Christie said, with a little toss meaning\nsomething. \"But most people want more to go upon than that.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\nDISCUSSION.\n\n\nNow Mrs. Fox, Doctor Jemmy's mother, was an enthusiastic woman. She was\ntwenty years younger than her husband, and felt herself fifty years his\nsenior (when genuine wisdom was needed) and yet in enterprise fifty\nyears junior. The velocity of her brain had been too much for the roots\nof her hair, as she herself maintained, and her best friends could not\ndeny it. Except that the top of her head was snow-white, and she utterly\nscorned to disguise it, she looked little older than her daughter\nChristie, in some ways; though happily tougher. She was not too fat, and\nshe was not too thin; which is more than most people can tell\nthemselves, at the age of eight and forty. Into this ancient County\nrace, which had strengthened its roots by banking, she had brought a\nfine vein of Devonian blood, very clearing for their complexions. She\nhad shown some disdain for mercantile views; until she began to know\nbetter, when her father, and others of her landed lineage slipped down\nthe hilltop into bankruptcy, without any Free-trade, or even tenants'\nsuperior rights, to excuse them. Then she perceived that mercantile\nviews are the only ones left to ensure a quiet man a fair prospect from\nhis own front windows. She encouraged her husband to cherish the Bank,\nwhich at one time she had derided; and she quite agreed with him, that\nno advances could save her own relations in their march downhill.\n\nThe elder James Fox, who like his father had refused a title--for\nalthough they were not Quakers now, they held to their old\nsimplicity--Mr. James Fox of Foxden was a fine sample of the unmixed\nEnglishman. He had never owed a penny of his large fortune to any\nunworthy trick of trade, or even to lucky gambling in stocks, or bitter\nmortgages. Many people called him stubborn, and they were welcome to\ntake that view of it. In business that opinion served him well, and\nsaved a lot of useless trouble. But he himself knew well, and his wife\nknew even better, that though he would never budge an inch, for claim,\nor threat, or lawsuit, there was no man who gave a longer ell, when\ndrawn out by mercy, or even gentle equity.\n\nBut in the full vigour of his faculties, mental if not bodily--and the\nlatter had not yet failed him much--that mysterious blow descended,\nwhich no human science can avert, relieve, or even to its own content\nexplain. One moment he was robust and active, quick with the pulse of\nbusy life, strong with the powers of insight, foresight, discrimination,\npromptitude--another moment, and all was gone. Only a numb lump\nremained, livid, pallid, deaf and dumb, sightless, breathless (beyond a\nwheezy snore) incapable even of a dream or moan. And knowing all these\nthings, men are proud!\n\nHis strong heart, and firm brain, bore him through; or rather they\ngradually shored him up; a fabric still upon the sands of time, but\nwaiting only for the next tidal wave.\n\nNow the greatest physician, or metaphysician, that ever came into the\nworld, can tell us no more than an embryo could, what the relics of the\nmind will be in such a case, or how far in keeping with its former self.\nThoroughly pious men have turned blasphemers; very hard swearers have\ntaken to sweet hymns; tempers have been changed from diabolical to\nangelic; but the change more often has been the other way. Happily for\nhimself, and all about him, this fine old man was weakened only, and not\nperverted from his former healthful self. His memory was deranged, in\nveins and fibres, like an ostrich-plume draggled in a gale of wind and\nrain; but he knew his old friends, and the favoured of his heart, and\nbefore and above all, his faithful wife. He had fallen from his pride,\nwith the lapse of other powers; and to those who had known him in his\nstronger days, his present gentleness was touching, and his gratitude\nfor trifles affecting; but notwithstanding that, he was sometimes more\nobstinate than ever.\n\n\"I wonder why Chris stays away so long;\" he said as he sat one fine day\nupon the terrace, for he was ordered to stay out of doors as much as\npossible, and his wife as usual sat beside him. \"She is gone to nurse\nJemmy through a very heavy cold, as I understood you to say, my dear.\nBut my memory is not always quite clear now. But it must be some days\nsince I heard that; and I miss little Chrissy with her cheerful face.\nYou are enough of course, my dear Mary, and I very seldom think much of\nanybody else. Still I long sometimes to see my little Chrissy.\"\n\n\"To be sure; and so do I. The house seems very sad without her;\" replied\nMrs. Fox, as if it could be merry now. \"We won't give her more than\nanother day or two. But we must remember, dear, how differently poor\nJemmy is placed from what we are in this comfortable house. Only one\nold rough Devonshire servant; and everybody knows what they are--a woman\nwho would warm his bed, as likely as not, with a frying-pan, and make\nhis tea out of the rain water boiler.\"\n\n\"He has no one to thank for it but himself.\"\n\nAfter this delivery, the father of the family shut his mouth, which he\nstill could do as well as ever, though one of his arms hung helpless.\n\n\"And I did hear that there was some disturbance there, something I think\nabout the clergyman, who is a great friend of Jemmy's;\" Mrs. Fox spoke\nthis in all good faith, for Dr. Freeborn had put this turn upon a story,\nwhich had found its way into the house; \"and you know what our Chris is,\nwhen she thinks any one attacks the Church--you may trust her for flying\nto the rescue. At any rate so far as money goes.\"\n\n\"And money goes a long way, in matters eccles--you know what I mean--I\ncan't pronounce those long words now. Christie is too generous with her\ngood aunt's money. The trustees let her have it much too freely. I\nshould not be much surprised if they get a hundred pounds out of Chris,\nat--let me see, what is the place called--something like a brooch or\ntrinket. Ah there, it's gone again!\"\n\n\"You must not talk so much, my dear; and above all you must not try your\nmemory. It is wonderfully good, I am sure, thank God! I only wish mine\nwas half as good.\"\n\nNow Mrs. Fox was quite aware that she had an exceedingly fine memory.\n\n\"Well, never mind;\" resumed the invalid, after roving among all the\njewels he could think of. \"But I should be very glad before I die, to\nsee Chrissy married to Sir Henry Haggerstone, a man of the highest\ncharacter, as well as a very fine estate. Has he said anything to you\nabout it lately?\"\n\n\"No, father;\" Mrs. Fox always called him \"father,\" when a family council\nwas toward; \"how could he while you--I mean why should he be in such a\nhurry? Christie is a girl who would only turn against him, if he were to\nworry her. She is a very odd child; she is not like her mother. A\nlittle spice of somebody else, I think, who has always contrived to have\nhis own way. And she hates the idea of being a stepmother; though there\nare only two little girls after all, and Chrissy's son would be the heir\nof course. She says it is so frightfully unromantic, to marry a wealthy\nwidower. But talk of the--I am sure I beg his pardon--but here comes Sir\nHenry himself, with Dr. Freeborn. You had better see the Doctor first,\nmy dear, while I take a turn with Sir Henry.\"\n\nThis gentleman was, as Mr. Fox had pronounced, of the very highest\ncharacter, wealthy moreover, and of pleasant aspect, and temper mild and\nequable. Neither was his age yet gone fatally amiss; though a few years\noff would have improved it, as concerning Christie; for he was not more\nthan thirty-three, or thirty-four, and scarcely looked that, for he led\na healthful life. But his great fault was, that he had no great fault;\nnothing extreme in any way about him, not even contempt for \"extreme\npeople.\" He had been at Oxford, and had learned, by reading for a first\nclass in classics (which he got) that virtue is a \"habit of fore-choice,\nbeing in the mean that concerns ourselves, defined by reason, and\naccording as the man of perception would define it.\"\n\nSir Henry was a man of very clear perception, and his nature was\nwell-fitted to come into definitions. He never did much thinking of his\nown; for deeper minds had saved him all that trouble, and he was quite\ncontent to accept the results. There was nobody who could lead him much,\nand no one who could not lead him a little, when he saw a clear path to\ngo along. This was not altogether the man to enchant romantic\nmaidenhood.\n\nChristie cared for him about as much as she would for a habit, that was\nin a mean. Not that he was in any way a prig, or laid down the law to\nany one. He had not kept up his Classics, for he had no real love for\nthem; and in those days, a man might get a first at Oxford, who could\nscarcely scan a Latin hexameter, if he were exceptionally strong in\n\"Science\"--then meaning Philosophy, before the age of \"Stinks.\" To none\nof these subjects did Christie pay heed--she did not care for the man;\nand that was all about it.\n\n\"You are quite right, Mrs. Fox. I think exactly as you do;\" this\ngentleman was replying to the lady of the house, as they walked upon the\ngentle slope towards the flower-garden; \"there are no real Whigs, in the\npresent headlong days. Men, like your husband, and myself, who have\nfancied ourselves in the happy mean, are either swept aside, or carried\ndown the deluge. For the moment there seems to be a slight reaction; but\nit will not last. The rush will only be more headlong. And in private\nlife it is just the same. Individual rights are to be no more respected.\nEverything belongs to everybody. I will tell you a little thing that\nhappened to myself, just as a specimen of the spirit of the age. A year\nor two ago, I bought some old manorial rights, in a thinly peopled part\nof Devonshire; in fact at the Western end of the great Blackdown Range,\na barren, furzy, flinty sort of place. By the by, not many miles away\nfrom the place where your son has gone to live--Perlycross. I only\nbought the manor to oblige a friend, who wanted a little ready money,\nand to go there now and then perhaps for a little rough shooting, for\nthe country is beautiful, and the air very fine. Well, the manorial\nrights included some quarries, or pits, or excavations of some sort,\nwhere those rough scythe-stones are dug, such as you see lying on that\nlawn. The land itself was actually part of the manor, from a time beyond\nmemory or record; but it seems as if strangers had been allowed to\nsettle on the hillside, and work these ancient quarries, and sell the\nproduce on their own account, only paying a small royalty to the manor,\nevery Martinmas, or about that time; not so much for the value of the\nmoney, (though it would perhaps be considerable under a proper\ncomputation) but as an acknowledgment of the ownership of the manor. But\nI fear I am tiring you.\"\n\n\"Not at all, Sir Henry; I like any story of that sort. Our laws are so\nvery very queer.\"\n\n\"Sometimes they are. Well, my friend had not deceived me. He said that\nthis Whetstone money was very hard to get, and was so trifling that he\nhad let it go sometimes, when the people objected to paying it, as they\ndid after any bad season. Last Martinmas, the matter slipped my memory,\nthrough domestic trouble. But this year, as the day approached, I sent\norders to a man, (a rough sort of Game-keeper, who lives near there, and\nlooks after the shooting and gravel and peat,) to give notice at the\npits that I meant to have my money. A very close corporation they seem\nto have established, and have made their encroachments uncommonly\nsecure, being quite distinct in race, and character, dialect, and even\ndress, I believe, from the settled people round them. Now what message\ndo you think they sent me?\"\n\n\"Something very insolent, I have no doubt.\" Mrs. Fox did not call\nherself even a Whig, but a downright determined Tory.\n\n\"This was it--my man got the schoolmaster to put it into writing, and I\nhappen to have it in my pocket. 'Not a penny will we pay this year. But\nif you like to come yourself, and take a turn at the flemmer'--something\nthey use for getting out the stone--'we won't charge you anything for\nyour footing.'\"\n\n\"Your footing on your own land! Well, that is very fine. What do you\nmean to do, Sir Henry?\"\n\n\"Grin, and bear it, I suppose, Mrs. Fox. You know what the tendency of\nthe time is, even in the Law-courts. And of course, all the Press would\nbe down upon me, as a monster of oppression, if I ventured to assert my\nrights. And though I am out of the House ever since the 'Broom of\nReform' (as the papers call it) swept my two little seats away, I might\nlike to stand again some day; and what a Whetstone this would be for my\nadversaries! And I hear that these people are not a bad lot, rough, and\nuncivilized, and wonderfully jealous over the 'rights' they have robbed\nme of; but among themselves faithful, and honest, and quiet, and sober,\nwhich is the strangest thing of all in England. As for their message,\nwhy they speak out plainly, and look upon their offer as a great\nconcession to me. And we in this more enlightened part must allow for\nthe manners of that neighbourhood. In fact this is such a perfect\ntrifle, after what they have been doing at Perlycross. If I were a\nmagistrate about there----\"\n\n\"At Perlycross! What do you mean? Some little matter about the\nclergyman? I want to know all about that, Sir Henry. It seems so\nstrange, that Christie never mentioned it.\"\n\nSir Henry perceived that he had \"put his foot in it.\" Dr. Freeborn had\nwarned him that the \"Sacrilege in Devon\"--as the Somerset papers had\nbegun to call it--must be kept most carefully from the knowledge of his\npatient, and from that of the lady also; for there was no saying how she\nmight take it. And now Mrs. Fox could not fail to find out everything.\nHe was ready to bite off his tongue, as ladies put it.\n\n\"Oh, ah--I was thinking of something--which had better not be referred\nto perhaps. Not quite fit to be discussed, when one has the honour of\nbeing with ladies. But about those very extraordinary people. I have\nheard some things that are highly interesting, things that I am certain\nyou would like to hear----\"\n\n\"Not half so much as I want to hear the story about the parish, where my\nson lives, and my daughter is staying, and will not come back--for some\nreason which we cannot make out. I must insist, Sir Henry, upon hearing\nall that you know. I am not a young woman, and know the world pretty\nwell by this time. You will not offend me, by anything you say; but you\nwill, by anything you hide.\"\n\nSir Henry Haggerstone looked about, and saw that he was in for it. The\nelderly lady--as some might call her--looked at him, with that pretty\ndoubt, which ladies so thoroughly understand how to show, and intend to\nbe understood without expression. The gentleman glanced at her; he had\nno moustache to stroke--for only cavalry officers, and cads of the most\npretentious upturn, as yet wore ginger hackles--a relief still to come\nin a downier age.\n\n\"My dear Mrs. Fox, there is nothing improper, from a lady's point of\nview, I mean, in the very sad occurrence at Perlycross. It is a question\nfor the local authorities. And not one for me to meddle with.\"\n\n\"Then why did you speak of it? Either tell me all; or say that you\nwon't, and leave me to find out.\" The lady had the gentleman, the Tory\nhad the temporizer, on the nail.\n\n\"We are nothing in your hands;\" he murmured, and with perfect truth;\nfor when the question comes to the pulling out of truth, what chance has\na man against a clever woman, ten times as quick as he is, and piercing\nevery glance?\n\n\"I am truly sorry that it has come to this;\" Mrs. Fox did not sympathise\nwith his regret, but nodded, as if to say--\"no cure now for that; for my\npart, I am rather glad.\" \"It was simply through terror of distressing\nyou, that all your best friends have combined, as I may say, at least\nhave thought it wiser----\"\n\n\"Then they made a great mistake. And I am not at all thankful to any of\nthem. Let me sit down here. And now for all this frightful wonder! Is\nJemmy dead? Let me have the worst at once.\"\n\nThis was a sudden relief to Sir Henry, enabling him to offer immediate\ncomfort, and to whisper--\"how could you imagine such a thing?\"\n\n\"No my dear madam,\" he continued, having now the upper hand, and hers\nbeneath it, \"I have the pleasure of assuring you that your noble son is\nin the very best of health, and improving by his admirable knowledge of\nmedicine the health of all around him. It is acknowledged that he has\nadvanced the highest interests of the Profession.\"\n\n\"That he was sure to do, Sir Henry. And he has a copy of my dear\ngrandmother's recipe for the pounded cherry-stone elixir.\"\n\n\"With all the resources of modern science added, and his own trained\ninsight in their application. But the worst of it is, that these leading\nintellects, as you must have experienced long ago, can never escape a\nsad amount of narrow professional jealousy. Your son must have fallen\namong those heavy-witted Devonshire doctors, like a thunderbolt--or\nworse, a phenomenon come to heal their patients _gratis_.\"\n\n\"That would drive them to do anything--to poison him, if they had the\ncourage. For every one knows how they run up their bills.\"\n\nHaving brought the lady thus to the practical vein, Sir Henry (as gently\nas possible, and as it were by the quarter drachm) administered the\nsombre draught he was now bound to exhibit. Jemmy's dear mother took it\nwith a closeness of attention, and critical appreciation, seldom found\nin the physical recipients in such cases. But to the administrator's\ngreat surprise, her indignation was by no means vivid, in the direction\nanticipated.\n\n\"I am heartily glad that I know this at last. I ought to have been told\nof it long ago;\" said Mrs. Fox, looking resolutely at Sir Henry\nHaggerstone. \"A very great mistake, and want of judgment on the part of\nDr. Freeborn. What a frightful risk to run--supposing my husband had\nbeen told suddenly of this!\"\n\n\"All has been done for the best, my dear madam. The great anxiety was to\nkeep it from him.\"\n\n\"And who was the proper one, to see to that? I should have thought, his\nwife and constant nurse. Was it thought impossible that I should show\ndiscretion? Clever men always make one great mistake. They believe that\nno woman can command her tongue. If they had their own only half as well\ncontrolled, there would not be a tenth part of the mischief in the\nworld.\"\n\n\"You are quite right there. That is a very great truth, and exceedingly\nwell expressed;\" replied Sir Henry, not that he was impressed with it so\ndeeply, but that he wanted to appease the lady. \"However, as regards Dr.\nFreeborn's ideas, I really know very little; no doubt he thought it was\nfor your own good too, not to be burdened at such a time with another\ngreat anxiety.\"\n\n\"He has taken too much upon himself. It would have been no great anxiety\nto me. My son is quite capable of fighting his own battles. And the same\norders issued to my son and daughter! At last I can understand poor\nChristie's letters--why she has been so brief, for fear of losing all\nself-control, like her mother. Stupid, stupid, clever men! Why there is\ninfinitely less chance now of Mr. Fox ever knowing it. You may tell our\nsapient doctor that. Perhaps I shall astonish him a little. I'll prove\nto him that I can control my tongue, by never mentioning the subject to\nhim.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, Mrs. Fox, if I make one or two remarks. May I speak without\nreserve, as an old friend of the family, and one who has had a great\ndeal to do with criminal--at least I mean to say with public\nproceedings in this county?\"\n\n\"To be sure, Sir Henry. I shall be much obliged by any suggestions you\nmay make.\"\n\n\"In the first place then, it is quite impossible to leave your son under\nthis imputation. I can quite understand how he has been impeded in\ntaking any steps for his own vindication, by his sense of duty towards\nhis father and yourself. In that respect, his behaviour has been most\nadmirable. He has absolutely done nothing; not even protested publicly,\nand challenged any evidence against him, but been quite content to lie\nat the mercy of any wicked slanderers. And for this there can be no\nreason but one--that public proceedings would increase the stir, and\nmake it certain that the whole must come to his father's knowledge.\"\n\n\"To be sure, Sir Henry. There can be no other reason.\" The old friend of\nthe family was surprised at the tone in which Mrs. Fox uttered this\nopinion.\n\n\"Of course not. And so it is all the more incumbent upon his family to\nclear him. Let me tell you what I should do, if I were his father, in\nsound health, and able to attend to business. Of course I am too young\nto speak so\"--he had suddenly remembered Christie--\"but that you\nunderstand; and you also admit that I am not likely to offer advice,\nunless asked for.\"\n\n\"I beg you particularly to give it. You are a Magistrate of large, if\nnot long, experience. And I know that you are our true friend.\"\n\n\"That you may rely upon, Mrs. Fox. And you know how much I admire your\nson; for enthusiasm is a rare gift now, and becoming rarer every year,\nin these days of liberal sentiment. If the case were my own, I should\njust do this. I should make application at once to the Court of King's\nBench, to have the matter sifted. It is no use shilly-shallying with any\nCounty Authorities. A Special Commission has been granted in cases less\nimportant. But without pressing for that, it is possible to get the\nwhole question investigated by skilled officers from head-quarters.\nThose who bring the charge should have done it, and probably would have\ndone it, if they had faith in their own case. But they are playing a\ndeeper game; according at least to my view of the matter. They have laid\nthemselves open to no action. Your son lies helpless, and must 'live it\ndown;' as people say glibly, who have never had to do it. Is this a\nthing you mean to allow?\"\n\n\"You need scarcely ask me that, Sir Henry. But remember that I know\nnothing of the particulars, which have been kept so--so amiably from my\nknowledge.\"\n\n\"Yes. But I know them all--at least so far as they can be gathered from\nthe Devonshire Journals, and these are very careful what they say. In\nspite of all the enemies who want to keep it going, the whole thing may\nbe brought to a point at once, by applying for a warrant in the Court of\nKing's Bench, with the proper information sworn. They would grant it at\nonce. Your son would appear, and be released of course on bail; for the\ncase is only one of misdemeanour. Then the proper officers would be sent\ndown, and the real criminals detected.\"\n\n\"A warrant against my Jemmy! Oh, Sir Henry, you can never mean that.\"\n\n\"Simply as a matter of form, Mrs. Fox. Ask your solicitors. They are the\nproper people. And they should have been consulted long ago, and would\nhave been, but for this terrible disadvantage. I only suggest the\nquickest way to bring the matter to an issue. Otherwise the doubt will\nhang over your son, with his friends and his conscience to support him.\nAnd what are these among so many?\"\n\nThis was not altogether a counsel of perfection, or even of a very lofty\nview; but unhappily we have to contend with a world neither perfect nor\nvery lofty. There was no other hole to be found in the plan, or even to\nbe picked by the ingenuity of a lady. But who that is worthy of that\nname cannot slip round the corner gracefully, whatever is presented?\n\n\"I thank you so deeply, Sir Henry, for your very kind interest in this\nstrange matter,\" said Mrs. Fox, looking all gratitude, with a smile that\nshone through tears; \"and for your perfectly invaluable advice. You see\neverything so distinctly, and your experience is so precious. To think\nof my poor boy in such a position! Oh dear, oh dear! I really have not\nthe courage to discuss it any more. But a kind heart like yours will\nmake every allowance for the feelings of a mother.\"\n\nThus was Sir Henry neatly driven from the hall of council to the\ncarpeted chamber of comfort. But he knew as well as if the lady had put\nit into so many words, that she meant to accept none of his advice. Her\nreason, however, for so resolving was far beyond his perception, simple\nas it was and natural.\n\nMrs. Fox had known little of the young doctor's doings, since he had\nsettled at Perlycross, having never even paid him a visit there, for her\nhusband was sore upon that subject. So that she was not acquainted with\nthe depth of Jemmy's regard for Sir Thomas, and had never dreamed of his\nlove for Inez; whereas she was strongly and bitterly impressed with his\nlifelong ardour for medical research. The mother felt no indignant\nyearning for prompt and skilled inquiry; because she suspected, in the\nbottom of her heart, that it would prove her son the criminal.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\nBLACKMARSH.\n\n\nA long way back among the Blackdown Hills, and in nobody knows what\nparish, the land breaks off into a barren stretch, uncouth, dark, and\ndesolate. Being neither hill nor valley, slope nor plain, morass nor\nwoodland, it has no lesson for the wanderer, except that the sooner he\ngets out of it the better. For there is nothing to gratify him if he be\nan artist, nothing to interest him if his tastes are antiquarian,\nnothing to arouse his ardour, even though he were that happy and most\nardent creature, a naturalist free from rheumatism. And as for any\nhonest fellow mainly concerned with bread and butter, his head will at\nonce go round with fear and with looking over his shoulders. For it is a\nlonesome and gruesome place, where the weather makes no difference;\nwhere Nature has not put her hand, on this part or on that, to leave a\nmark or show a preference, but slurred the whole with one black frown\nof desolate monotony.\n\nThat being so, the few and simple dwellers on the moorland around, or in\nthe lowland homesteads, might well be trusted to keep their distance\nfrom this dreary solitude. There were tales enough of hapless travellers\nlast seen going in this direction, and never in any other; as well as of\nspectral forms, low groans, and nightly processions through the air.\n\nNot more than a hundred years ago, there had been a wicked baronet,\nprofane, rapacious, arrogant, blackhearted, foul, and impious. A blessed\ncurate prayed him not to hunt on Holy Friday. He gave the blessed curate\ntaste of whip-thong from his saddle; then blew seven blasts of his horn,\nto proclaim that he would hunt seven days in every week, put spurs to\nhis black horse, and away. The fox, disturbed on Holy Friday, made for\nthis \"Forbidden land;\" which no fox had ever done before. For his life\nhe plunged into it, feeling for the moment that nothing could be worse\nthan to be torn in pieces. The hounds stopped, as if they were turned to\nstone in the fury of their onslaught. The huntsman had been left far\nbehind, having wife and family. But the wicked baronet cracked his whip,\nblew three blasts on his horn, leaned forward on his horse and gave him\nthe rowel. The hounds in a frenzy threw up their sterns, and all plunged\nheadlong into it. And ever since that, they may be seen (an hour after\nsun-down, on every Sunday of the season, and any Holy Friday) in full\ncry scouring through the air, with the wicked baronet after them,\nlashing his black horse, and blowing his horn, but with no fox in front\nto excuse them.\n\nThese facts have made the Forbidden land, or the Blackmarsh, as some\ncall it, even less desirable than its own complexion shows it. And it is\nso far from Perlycross, that any man on foot is tired by the time he\ngets there, and feels that he has travelled far enough, and in common\nsense must go home again.\n\nBut there was one Perlycrucian now--by domicile, not nativity--of\ntireless feet, and reckless spirit, too young for family ties, and too\nimpetuous for legends. By this time he was admitted to the freedom of\nevery hedge and ditch in the parish, because he was too quick to be\ncaught, and too young to be prosecuted. \"Horatio Peckover\" was his name,\nby usage cut short into \"Hopper\"; a lad in advance of his period, and\nthe precursor of all \"paper-chases.\"\n\nLike many of those who are great in this line, he was not equally strong\nin the sedentary uses of that article. Mr. Penniloe found him so far\nbehind, when pen and ink had to be dealt with, that he put him under the\nfine Roman hand of Sergeant Jakes, the schoolmaster. Jakes was not too\nrichly endowed by a grateful country, for years of heroism; neither was\nhis stipend very gorgeous, for swinging cane in lieu of gun. Sixpence an\nhour was his figure, for pen-drill of private pupils, and he gladly\nadded Hopper to the meagre awkward-squad.\n\nSoon an alliance of the closest kind was formed; the veteran taking warm\ninterest in the spirited sallies of youth, and the youth with eager\nthirst imbibing the fine old Peninsular vintage of the brightest ruby,\npoured forth in the radiance of a yellow tallow candle. For the long\nschool-room was cleared at night of coats, and hats, and green-baize\nbags, cracked slates, bead-slides, and spelling-books, and all the other\naccoutrements, and even toys of the youthful Muse; and at seven o'clock\nHoratio stepped across the road from the rectory, sat down at the\nmaster's high black desk, and shouldered arms for the copy-drill. The\nSergeant was famed for his flourishes, chiefly of his own invention, and\nhad promised to impart that higher finish, when the fancy capitals were\nmastered.\n\n\"What a whack of time it does take, Sergeant!\" cried Hopper, as he\ndipped his pen, one Friday night. \"Not half so bad as Latin though, and\nthere is something to look at afterwards. Capitals almost captured now.\nAh, you have taken the capitals of many a country, Sergeant. Halloa!\n'Xerxes was conqueror at Marathon,' to-night! Sergeant, are you quite\nsure of that? I thought it was another fellow, with a longer\nname--Milly, Tilly, something.\"\n\n\"No, Master Hopper; if it had been, we must have passed him long ago,\namong the big M's.\"\n\n\"To be sure. What a muff I was, not to think of that! I beg your\npardon, Sergeant. There's scarcely anything you don't know.\"\n\n\"I had that on the highest authority--right elbow more in to your side,\nsir, if you please--that Xerxes copy was always set by commanding\nofficer at Turry Vardoes--could not tell what to do with the men at\nnight--so many ordered to play at nine-pins, and so many told off to\nlearn roundhand. If it had not been for that, sir, I should never have\nbeen equal to my present situation.\"\n\n\"Then it must have been Xerxes, Sergeant. And after all, how can it\nmatter, when it happened so long ago? A blot again? D--n it.\"\n\n\"Master Hopper, I am very sorry, but it is my duty to reprimand you, for\nthe use of profane language. Never permitted, sir, in school-hours.\nWould you do it, before Mr. Penniloe?\"\n\n\"I should rather hope not. Wouldn't old Pen stare? And then he'd be down\nupon me, like the very--capital D. Sergeant, pray excuse me; I only\nthought of him, without any name. I suppose we may call him 'Old Nick'\nthough, without having to go to him, for doing it. I never could see\nwhat the difference was. But, my eye, Sergeant, I expected to see the\nold chap yesterday, cloven hoof, tail, eyes of fire, and everything!\"\n\n\"What do you mean, sir? Where was he? Not in Perlycross, I hope.\"\nSergeant Jakes glanced down the long dark room, and then at the pegs\nwhere his French sword was hanging.\n\n\"No, not here. He daren't come so near the church. But in the place\nwhere he lives all day, according to the best authorities. You have\nheard of Blackmarsh, haven't you? No marsh at all--that's the joke of\nit--but the queerest place I ever saw in all my life. Criky jimminy, but\nit is a rum un!\"\n\n\"You don't mean to say you were there, sir!\" The Sergeant took his hand\nfrom Hopper's shoulder, and went round to see whether he was joking.\n\n\"To be sure I was, as large as life, and twice as natural! Had a\nholiday, as you know, and got leave off from dinner. Mother Muggridge\ngave me grub enough to go to Halifax. I had been meaning to go there\never so long, because everybody seems to funk it so. Why there's\nnothing there to be afraid of: though it makes you look about a bit. And\nyou aren't sorry to come out of it.\"\n\n\"Did you tell Mr. Penniloe, you had been there, Master Hopper?\"\n\n\"Sergeant, do you see any green in my eye?\" Horatio dropped his pen, and\nenlarged the aperture of one eye, in a style very fashionable just then,\nbut never very elegant.\n\n\"No sir, I can't answer fairly that I do. And I don't believe there ever\nwas much, even when you was a babby.\"\n\n\"Mum's the word, you see then--even to old Muggridge, or she might be\nfool enough to let out. But I say, Sergeant, I've got a little job for\nyou to do. Easy enough. I know you won't refuse me.\"\n\n\"No sir, that I won't. Anything whatever that lays in my power, Master\nHopper.\"\n\n\"Well, it's only this--just to come with me to-morrow--half-holiday, you\nknow, and I can get off, plum-duffs--always plum-duffs on a Saturday,\nand you should just see Pike pitching into them--and we'll give the\nafternoon to it, and examine Blackmarsh pretty thoroughly.\"\n\n\"Blackmarsh, Master Hopper! The Forbidden land--where Sir Robert upon\nhis black horse, and forty hounds in full cry before him, may be seen\nand heard, sweeping through the air, like fiends!\"\n\n\"Oh, that's all my eye, and Betty Martin! Nobody believes that, I should\nhope. Why Sergeant, a man who knows all about Xerxes, and has taken half\nthe capitals in Europe--oh, I say, Sergeant, come, you are not afraid\nnow, and a fellow of sixteen, like me, to go there all by myself, and\nstop--well, nearly half-an-hour!\"\n\n\"Afraid! Not I. No certainly not, after mountains, and forests, and\ncaverns, and deserts. But the distance, Master Hopper, for a man of my\nage, and troubled with rheumatism in the knee-joint.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's all right! I have planned out all that. Of course I don't\nexpect you to go ten miles an hour. But Baker Channing's light cart\ngoes, every other Saturday, to Crooked-post quarry, at the further end\nof Hagdon, to fetch back furze enough to keep his oven going, from a\nstack he bought there last summer. To-morrow is his day; and you have\nno school, you know, after half-past ten or eleven. You ride with old\nTucker to the Crooked-post, and come back with him, when he is loaded\nup. It shan't cost you a farthing. I have got a shilling left, and he\nshall have it. It is only two miles, or so, from Crooked-post to this\nend of Blackmarsh; and there you will find me waiting. Come, you can't\nget out of that.\"\n\n\"But what do you want me there for, sir? Of course, I'd go anywhere you\nwould venture, if I could see any good in it.\"\n\n\"Sergeant, I'll tell you what. You thought a great deal of Sir Thomas\nWaldron, didn't you?\"\n\n\"More than of any man that ever lived, or ever will see the light of\nthis wicked world.\"\n\n\"And you didn't like what was done to him, did you?\"\n\n\"Master Hopper, I tell you what. I'd give ten years off my poor life, if\nI could find out who did it.\"\n\n\"Then I fancy I have found out something about it. Not much, mind; but\nstill something, and may come to more if we follow it up. And if you\ncome to-morrow, I'll show you what it is. You know that my eyes are\npretty sharp, and that I wasn't born yesterday. You know who it was that\nfound 'Little Billy.' And you know who wants to get Fox out of this\nscrape, because he is a Somerset man, and all that, and doesn't deserve\nthis trouble. And still more, because----\"\n\n\"Well, Master Hopper, still more, because of what?\"\n\n\"I don't mind telling you something, Sergeant--you have seen a lot of\nthe world, you know. Because Jemmy Fox has got a deuced pretty sister.\"\n\n\"Oh come, Master Hopper, at your time of life! And not even got into the\nflourishes!\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter, Jakes. I may seem rather young to people who don't\nunderstand the question. But that is my own business, I should hope.\nWell, I shall look out for you to-morrow. Two o'clock at the latest.\"\n\n\"But why shouldn't we tell Dr. Fox himself, and get him to come with us?\nThat seems the simplest thing.\"\n\n\"No. There are very good reasons against that. I have found this out;\nand I mean to stick to it. No one would have dreamed of it, except for\nme. And I won't have it spoiled, by every nincompoop poking his nose\ninto it. Only if we find anything more, and you agree with me about it,\nwe will tell old Pen, and go by his opinion.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir. It all belongs to you; as it did to me, when I was\nfirst after Soult's arrival to discover the advance of the French\noutposts. You shall have the credit, though I didn't. Anything more,\nsir? The candle is almost out.\"\n\n\"Sergeant, no more. Unless you could manage--I mean, unless you should\nthink it wise to bring your fine old sword with you. You say there is no\nsuch piece of steel----\"\n\n\"Master Hopper, there is no such piece, unless it was Lord Wellington's.\nThey say he had one that he could lean on--not a dress-sword, not\nflummery, but a real workman--and although he was never a heavy man, a\nstone and a half less than I was then, it would make any figure of the\nmultiplication-table that he chose to call for, under him. But I mustn't\ncarry arms in these days, Master Hopper. I shall bring a bit of Spanish\noak, and trust in the Lord.\"\n\nOn the following day, the sun was shining pretty well for the\ndecrepitude of the year. There had been no frost to speak of, since that\nfirst sharp touch about three weeks back. The air was mild, and a\nwesterly breeze played with the half ripe pods of gorse, and the brown\nwelting of the heather. Hopper had brought a long wand of withy, from\nthe bank of the last brook he had leaped, and he peeled it with his\npocket-knife, and sat (which he seldom did when he could help it) on a\ntuft of rush, waiting for the Sergeant. He stretched his long wiry legs,\nand counted the brass buttons on his yellow leathern gaiters, which came\nnearly to his fork, and were made fast by narrow straps to his\nbrace-buttons.\n\nThis young man--as he delighted to be called--had not many grievances,\nbecause he ran them off so fast; but the two he chiefly dwelt upon, in\nhis few still moments, were the insufficiency of cash and calf. For the\nformer he was chiefly indebted to himself, having never cultivated\npowers of retention; for the deficiency of calves, however, nature was\nto blame, although she might plead not unfairly that they were allowed\nno time to grow. He regarded them now with unmerited contempt, and\nslapped them in some indignation, with the supple willow wand. It might\nwell be confessed that they were not very large, as is often the case\nwith long-distance runners; but for all that they were as hard as nails,\nand endowed with knobs of muscle, tough and tense as coiled mainspring.\nIn fact there was not a bit of flabby stuff about him; and his high\nclear colour, bright eyes, and ready aspect made him very pleasant to\nbehold, though his nose was rather snubby, and his cheekbones high, and\nhis mouth of too liberal aperture.\n\n\"Come along, Sergeant, what a precious time you have taken!\" Hopper\nshouted, as the angular outline of the veteran appeared at last in a gap\nbetween two ridges. \"Why, we shall scarcely have two hours of good\ndaylight left. And how do you know that Tucker won't go home without\nyou?\"\n\n\"He knows a bit better than that,\" replied Jakes, smiling with dark\nsignificance. \"Master Hopper, I've got three of Tucker's boys in\nHorseshoe. Tucker is bound to be uncommon civil.\"\n\nNow the \"Horseshoe\" was a form in the school at Perlycross especially\nadapted for corporal applications, snug as a cockpit, and affording no\npossibility of escape. And what was still better, the boys of that class\nwere in the very prime of age for attracting, as well as appreciating,\nhealthy and vigorous chastisement; all of them big enough to stand it,\nnone of them big enough to kick, and for the most part newly trouser'd\ninto tempting chubbiness. Truly it might be said, that the parents of\nplayful boys in the \"Horseshoe\" had given hostages to education.\n\n\"But bless my heart--what--what?\" continued the ancient soldier, as he\nfollowed the rapid steps of Hopper, \"why, I don't like the look of this\nplace at all. It looks so weist--as we say about here, so unwholesome,\nand strange, and ungodly, and--and so timoursome.\"\n\n\"It is ever so much worse further on; and you can't tell where you are\nat all. But to make sure of our coming back, if--if there should be\nnothing to prevent us, I have got this white stick ready, and I am going\nto fix it on the top of that clump. There now, we shall be able to see\nthat for miles.\"\n\n\"But we are not going miles I hope, Master Hopper. I'm a little too\nstiff for such a walk as that. You don't know what it is to have a pain\nin your knee.\"\n\n\"Oh don't I? I come down on it often enough. But I don't know exactly\nhow far we are going. There is nothing to measure distance by. Come\nalong, Sergeant! We'll be just like two flies going into one of your big\nink-pots.\"\n\n\"Don't let me lose sight of you, Master Hopper. I mean, don't you lose\nsight of me. You might want somebody to stand by you. It is the darkest\nbit of God's earth I ever did see. And yet nothing overhead to darken\nit. Seems almost to make its own shadow. Good Lord! what was that came\nby me?\"\n\n\"Oh, a bat, or an owl, or a big dor-beetle; or it might be a\nthunder-bolt--just the sort of place for them. But--what a bad place it\nis for finding things!\"\n\nThere could scarcely have been a worse one, at least upon dry and\nunforested land. There was no marsh whatever, so far as they had come,\nbut a dry uneven shingly surface, black as if fire had passed over it.\nThere was no trace however of fire, neither any substance sufficient to\nhold it, beyond the mere passage of a shallow flame. The blackness that\ncovered the face of the earth, and seemed to stain the air itself, and\nheavily dim the daylight, was of something unknown upon the breezy\nhills, or in the clear draught of a valley. It reflected no light, and\nreceived no shadow, but lay like the strewing of some approach to\nquarters undesirable. Probably from this (while unexamined by such men\nas we have now), the evil repute of the place had arisen, going down\ngenerations of mankind, while the stuff at the bottom renewed itself.\n\nThis stuff appeared to be the growth of some lanky trailing weed,\nperhaps some kind of _Persicaria_, but unusually dense and formless,\nresembling what may be seen sometimes, at the bottom of a dark\nwatercourse, where the river slides without a wrinkle, and trees of\nthick foliage overhang it. And the same spread of life, that is more\nlike death, may be seen where leagues of laver strew the foreshore of an\nAtlantic coast, when the spring-tides are out, and the winds gone low.\n\n\"By George, here we are at last. Thought I should never have made it\nout, in the thick of this blessed cobobbery,\" shouted Hopper, stopping\nshort and beckoning; \"now, Sergeant, what do you say to that? Queer\nthing, just here, isn't it?\"\n\nThe veteran's eyes, confused and weary with the long monotony, were\ndazzled by sudden contrast. Hitherto the dreary surface, uniform and\ntrackless, had offered only heavy plodding, jarred by the jerk of a\nhidden stone sometimes, but never elastic. All the boundary-beaters of\nthe parish, or even a regiment of cavalry, might have passed throughout,\nand left no trace upon the padded cumber. But here a glaring stripe of\nsilver sand broke through the blackness, intensely white by contrast,\nthough not to be seen a few yards off, because sunk below the level.\nLike a crack of the ground from earthquake, it ran across from right to\nleft, and beyond it all was black again.\n\nThe ancient soldier glanced around, to be sure that no surprise was\nmeant; and then with his big stick tried the substance of the white\nmaterial. With one long stride he could have reached the other side, but\nthe caution of perilous days awoke.\n\n\"Oh there's nothing in that, and it is firm enough. But look here;\" said\nhis young companion, \"this is what floors me altogether.\"\n\nHe pointed to a place where two deep tracks, as of narrow wheels,\ncrossed the white opening; and between them were three little pits about\nthe size and depth of a gallon saucepan. The wheel-tracks swerved to the\nleft, as if with a jerk to get out of the sandy hollow, and one of the\nthree footprints was deeper and larger than the other two.\n\n\"Truly this is the doing of the arch-enemy of mankind himself.\" Sergeant\nJakes spoke solemnly, and yet not very slowly; for he longed to make off\nwith promptitude.\n\n\"The doing, more likely, of those big thieves who couldn't let your\nColonel rest in his grave. Do you mean to turn tail upon them, Sergeant\nJakes?\"\n\n\"May the Lord turn His back upon me, if I do!\" The veteran's colour\nreturned to his face, and all thoughts of flight departed. \"I would go\nto the ends of the world, Master Hopper, after any living man; but not\nafter Satan.\"\n\n\"The Devil was in them. No doubt about that. But he made them do it for\nHim. Does Old Nick carry whipcord? You see how that was, don't you?\"\n\nThe youth leaped across, and brought back the lash of a whip which he\nhad concealed there. \"Plain as a pikestaff, Sergeant. When the wheels\nplunged into this soft stuff, the driver must have lashed like fury, to\nmake him spring the cart out again. Off came the old lash, and here it\nis. But wait a minute. I've got something more to show you, that spots\nthe villains pretty plain.\"\n\n\"Well, sir,\" said Jakes, regarding Hopper with no small admiration, \"you\ndeserve your stripes for this. Such a bright young gent shouldn't be\nthrown away in the Church. I was just going to say--'how can we tell\nthey did it?' Though none but thundering rogues would come here. Nothing\ncan be clearer than that, I take it.\"\n\n\"Then you, and I, are thundering rogues. Got you there, Sergeant; by\ngum, I did! Now come on a few steps further.\"\n\nThey stepped out boldly, having far less fear of human than of\nsuperhuman agency; though better had they met Apollyon perhaps, than the\nwild men they were tracing. Within less than a furlong, they reached an\nopening where the smother of the black weeds fell away, and an open\ntrack was left once more. Here the cart-wheels could be traced\ndistinctly, and at one spot something far more convincing. In the middle\nof the track a patch of firm blue clay arose above the surface, for a\ndistance of perhaps some fifty yards; and on it were frequent\nimpressions of the hoofs of a large horse, moving slowly. And of these\nimpressions one (repeated four or five times, very clearly) was that of\nthe near fore-foot, distinctly showing a broken shoe, and the very slope\nand jag of the fracture.\n\n\"What do you think of that now, Sergeant?\" asked Hopper, as he danced in\ntriumph, but took good care not to dance upon the clay. \"They call me a\nhedger and ditcher, don't they? Well, I think I am a tracker too.\"\n\n\"Master Hopper, to my mind, you are an uncommonly remarkable young gent.\nThe multiplication-table may not be strongly in your line, sir. But you\ncan put two and two together, and no fear to jump on top of them.\"\n\n\"Oh, but the bad luck of it, Sergeant! The good luck for them, and the\nshocking luck for me. I never came to old Pen's shop, you see, till a\nday or two after that wicked job was over. And then it took me a\nfortnight, or more, to get up the lay of the country, and all that. And\nI was out of condition for three days, with a blessed example in the\nEton Grammar. _Percontatorem fugito_, that frightened me no end, and\nthrew me off the hooks. But I fancy, I am on the right hook now.\"\n\n\"That you are, sir, and no mistake. And a braver young man never came\ninto a regiment, even in Sir Arthur's time. Sir, you must pitch away\ncopy-books. Education is all very fine for those who can't do no better.\nBut it spoils a young man, with higher gifts.\"\n\n\"Don't say a good word of me, till you know all,\" replied the candid\nHopper. \"I thought that I was a pretty plucky fellow, because I was all\nby myself, you understand, and I knew that no fellow could catch me, in\na run across the open. But I'll show you where I was stodged off; and it\nhas been on my conscience ever since. Just come to that place, where the\nground breaks off.\"\n\nHe led the way along a gentle slope, while the light began to fail\nbehind them, until they stood upon the brink of a steep descent, with a\nsharp rise upon the other side. It was like the back-way to the bottom\nof a lime-kiln, but there was no lime for many leagues around. The track\nof cart-wheels was very manifest, and the bottom was dark with the\napproach of night.\n\n\"My turn, Master Hopper, to go first now. No wife, or family, and nought\nto leave behind.\" With these words spoken in a whisper, the Sergeant\n(who had felt much self-reproach, at the superior courage of a peaceful\ngeneration) began to go stiffly down the dark incline, waving his hand\nfor the other to wait there.\n\n\"In for a penny, in for a pound. I can kick like winkin', though I can't\nfight much.\" With these words, the gallant Hopper followed, slowing his\nquick steps to the heavier march in front.\n\nWhen they came to the bottom, they found a level space, with room enough\nto turn a horse and cart. It was getting very dusky where they stood,\nwith the grim sides gathering round them, and not a tree or bush to\ngive any sign of life, but the fringe of the dominant black weed, like\nheavy brows, shagging the outlook. But on the left hand, where the steep\nfell back, was the mouth as of a cave scooped roughly. Within it, all\nwas black with gloom, and the low narrow entrance showed little\nhospitality.\n\n\"I don't care a d--n,\" said Sergeant Jakes, forgetful of school\ndiscipline; \"if there's any scoundrel there, I'll drag him out. If it's\nold Colonel's bones--well I'm not afraid of them.\" There remained just\nlight enough to show that the cart had been backed up to the entrance.\n\n\"Where you go, I go;\" replied the dauntless Hopper; and into it they\nplunged, with their hearts beating high, but their spirit on fire for\nanything.\n\nThe sound of their steps, as they passed into the darkness, echoed the\nemptiness of the place. There was nothing to be felt, except rugged\nflinty sides, and the damp chill which gathered in their hair; and in\nthe middle, a slab of broken stone, over which they stumbled into one\nanother's arms. They had no means of striking a light; but as their eyes\ngrew accustomed to the gloom, they assured themselves that there was\nnothing more to learn, unless it might be from some small object on the\nfloor. There seemed to be no shelves, no sort of fixture, no recesses;\nonly the bare and unoccupied cave.\n\n\"I tell you what,\" said Sergeant Jakes, as they stood in the open air\nagain; \"this has been a smuggler's store in the war-time; a natural\ncave, improved no doubt. What we thought to find is gone further on, I\nfear. Too late, Master Hopper, to do any more to-day, and perhaps too\nlate to do any more at all. But we must come again with a light, if\npossible on Monday.\"\n\n\"Well, one thing we have proved--that the villains, whoever they were,\nmust have come from up the country; perhaps as far off as the Mendip\nHills. But keep it to yourself, till we have settled what to do. Not a\nword to Tucker, or the news will be all over Perlycross to-night. Come\nback to the hoof-marks, and I'll take a copy. If we could only find the\nimpressions of the men's feet too! You see after all, that Joe Crang\nspoke the truth. And it was the discovery of his 'Little Billy' that led\nme on in this direction.\"\n\nThere was light enough still, when they came back to the clay-patch, to\nmake a rough tracing of the broken shoe, on the paper in which the youth\nhad brought his bread and bacon; and even that great steeple-chaser was\nglad to go home in company, and upon a truss of furze, with a flour-sack\nto shield him from the stubs and prickles.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\nFIRESHIP AND GALLEON.\n\n\nMeanwhile, the fair Christie was recovering nerve so fast, and\nestablished in such bouncing health again, by the red-wheat bread of\nWhite Post Farm, that nothing less would satisfy her than to beard--if\nthe metaphor applies to ladies--the lion in the den, the arch-accuser,\nin the very court of judgment. In a word, she would not rest until she\nstood face to face with Lady Waldron. She had thought of it often, and\nbecame quite eager in that determination, when her brother related to\nher what had passed, in his interview with Miss Waldron.\n\nTruly it was an enterprise of great pith, for a fair young English girl,\nto confront the dark majestic foreign lady, stately, arrogant,\nimperious, and above all, embittered with a cruel wrong, fierce,\nmalignant, rancorous. But for all that, Christie was resolved to do it;\nthough perfectly aware that the Spanish lady would never be \"at home\" to\nher, if she could help it.\n\nFor this reason, and this alone, as she positively assured herself, did\nMiss Fox make so long a stay with Mrs. Gilham, the while she was quite\nwell enough to go back to Old Barn, and the path of duty led her to her\nbrother's side. But let her once return to that side, and all hope would\nbe lost of arranging an encounter with the slanderer; inasmuch as Dr.\nJemmy would most sternly interdict it. Her good hostess, all the while,\nwas only too glad to keep her; and so was another important member of\nthe quiet household; and even the flippant Rosie was delighted to have\nsuch patterns. For Miss Fox had sent for a large supply of dresses, all\nthe way to Foxden, by the key-bugleman of the _Defiance_; because it\nwould save such a vast amount in carriage, while one was so near the\nGreat Western road. \"I can't understand it,\" protested Doctor Jemmy. \"As\nif men ever could!\" replied the young lady.\n\nHowever, the sweetest slice of sugar-cane must have empty pores too\nsoon, and the last drop of honey drains out of the comb, and the silver\nvoice of the flute expires, and the petals of the fairest rose must\nflag. All these ideas (which have been repeated, or repeated themselves,\nfor some thousands of years) were present for the first time in all\nexistence--according to his conviction--in the mind of an exalted, yet\ndepressed, young farmer, one fine Monday morning. Miss Fox had received\nher very last despatch, to the tune of \"Roast beef,\" that morning, and\nsad to say she had not cut the string, though her pretty fingers flirted\nwith it.\n\n\"My dear,\" said Mrs. Gilham, longing much to see within, inasmuch as she\nstill had a tender heart for dainty tint, and true elegance of tone, \"if\nyou wish to save the string--fine whipcord every inch of it--Frank has a\npicker in the six-bladed knife his Godfather Farrant gave him, that will\nundo any knot that was ever tied by Samson.\" Upon him, she meant\nperhaps; however the result is quite the same.\n\n\"No, thank you,\" answered Christie, with a melancholy glance; \"it had\nbetter be put in my trunk, as it is. What induced them to send it, when\nI'm just going away?\"\n\n\"Going away! Next week, my dear, you may begin to think about it.\"\n\n\"To-morrow, I must go. I am as well as ever. Better a great deal, I\nought to say. What did Dr. Gronow say on Saturday? And I came down here;\nnot to enjoy myself, but to keep up the spirits of my poor dear\nbrother.\"\n\n\"Why his spirits are fine, Miss Fox. I only wish my poor dear Frank had\na quarter of them. Last night I am sure--and a Sunday too, when you and\nmy son were gone to church----\"\n\n\"To the little church close by, you mean, with Mrs. Coombes and Mary;\nbecause the sermon in the morning had felt so--so edifying.\"\n\n\"Yes to be sure. But when your brother came in, and was surprised not\nto find you with us, you know; his conversation--oh dear, oh dear,\nrather worldly-minded I must confess, bearing in mind what day it\nwas--but he and Rose they kept it up together, for the tip of her tongue\nis fit for anybody's ear-ring, as the ancient saying goes,--laughing,\nMiss Fox, and carrying on, till, although I was rather put out about it,\nand would have stopped any one but a visitor, I was absolutely\ncompelled, I assure you, to pull out my pocket-handkerchief. Oh, I don't\nthink, there need be much fear about Doctor Jemmy's spirits!\"\n\n\"But don't you think, Mrs. Gilham, it is chiefly his pride that supports\nhim? We do the same sort of thing sometimes. We go into the opposite\nextreme, and talk and laugh, as if we were in the highest spirits,--when\nwe--when we don't want to let somebody know that we care what he\nthinks.\"\n\n\"Oh, you have learned that, have you, my dear?\" The old lady looked at\nher, with some surprise. \"Well, well! Happy will be the man that you do\nit for.\"\n\nChristie felt that she was blushing, and yet could not help giving one\nsharp glance at her simple hostess. And it would have gone hard with\nFrank Gilham's chances, if the maiden had spied any special meaning in\nthe eyes of his dear mother. But the elderly lady gazed benignant,\nreflecting softly upon the time when she had been put to those disguises\nof the early maidenhood; which are but the face, with its first bloom\nupon it. For the plain truth was, that she did not wish her son to fall\nin love, for some ten years yet, at the age that had suited his father.\nAnd as for Miss Fox, half a glimpse at her parcels would show her entire\nunfitness.\n\n\"I shall never do it for any man,\" said Christie, in scorn of her own\nsuggestion; \"if I am anything, I am straightforward. And if ever I care\nfor any man, I shall give him my hand, and tell him so. Not, of course,\ntill I know that he is gone upon me. But now I want to do a crafty\nthing. And money can do almost anything--except in love, Mrs. Gilham. I\nwould not do it without your knowledge; for that would be a very mean\nreturn for all your kindness to me. I have made up my mind to see Lady\nWaldron, and tell her just what I think of her.\"\n\n\"My dear, Lady Waldron is nothing to me. The Gilhams have held their\nown land, from the time of crossbows and battle-axes. Besides our own,\nwe rent about fifty acres of the outside of the Waldron property. But if\nthey can get more for it, let them do so. Everybody loved poor Sir\nThomas; and it was a pleasure to have to deal with him. But there is no\nsuch feeling about her ladyship; noble enough to look at, but best to\ndeal with at a distance.\"\n\n\"Well, I mean to see her at close quarters. She has behaved shamefully\nto my brother. And who is she to frighten me? She is at the bottom of\nall these wicked, wretched falsehoods, that go about. And she would not\neven see him, to let him speak up for truth and justice. I call that\nmean, and low, and nasty. Of course the subject is horrible to her; and\nperhaps,--well, perhaps I should have done the same. But for all that, I\nmean to see her; for I love fair play; and this is foul play.\"\n\n\"What a spirit you have, my dear! I should never have thought it was in\nyour gentle face. But you are in the right. And if I can help you--that\nis, if you are equal to it----\"\n\n\"I am more than equal to it, my dear friend. What is there to fear, with\nthe truth against black falsehoods?\"\n\nMrs. Gilham turned her wedding-ring upon her \"marriage-finger\"--a thing\nshe never failed to do, when her heart was busy with the bygone days.\nThen she looked earnestly at her guest, and saw that the point to be\nconsidered was--not shall we attempt it, but how shall it be done?\n\n\"Your mind is entirely set upon it. And therefore we will do our best;\"\nshe promised. \"But it cannot be managed in a moment. Will you allow me\nto consult my son? It seems like attacking a house almost. But I suppose\nit is fair, in a case like this.\"\n\n\"Perfectly fair. Indoors it must be, as there is no other chance. A\nthief must be caught inside a house, when he will not come out of it.\nAnd a person is no better than a thief, who locks her doors against\njustice.\"\n\nWhen Frank was consulted, he was much against the scheme; but his\nopposition was met more briefly than his mother's had been.\n\n\"Done it shall be; and if you will not help, it shall be done without\nyou\"--was the attitude taken, not quite in words; but so that there was\nno mistaking it. Then he changed sides suddenly, confuted his own\nreasoning, and entered into the plan quite warmly; especially when it\nwas conceded that he might be near the house, if he thought proper, in\ncase of anything too violent, or carried beyond what English ladies\ncould be expected to endure. For as all agreed, there was hardly any\nsaying what an arrogant foreigner might not attempt.\n\n\"I am quite aware that it will cost a large amount of bribery,\" said\nChristie, with a smile which proved her faith in her own powers in that\nline; \"will ten pounds do it, Mr. Frank, should you suppose?\"\n\nThough far gone in that brilliant and gloomy, nadir and zenith, tropical\nand arctic, condition of the human mind, called love, Frank Gilham was\nof English nature; which, though torn up by the roots, ceases not to\nstick fast to the main chance. And so much the nobler on his part was\nthis, because the money was not his, nor ever likely so to be.\n\n\"I think that three pounds ought to do it, or even fifty shillings,\" he\nreplied, with an estimate perhaps too low of the worth of the British\ndomestic. \"If we could choose a day when old Binstock is off duty, it\nwould save the biggest tip of all. And it would not matter what he\nthought afterwards, though doubtless he would be in a fury.\"\n\n\"Oh, I won't do it. I don't think I can do it. It does seem so nasty,\nand underhanded.\"\n\nComing now to the practical part, Miss Fox was suddenly struck with the\nobjections.\n\n\"My dear, I am very glad that you have come to see it in such a proper\nlight;\" cried Mrs. Gilham a little prematurely, while her son nodded\nvery sagely, ready to say \"Amen\" to either side, according to the final\njump of the vacillating reasoner.\n\n\"No, but I won't then. I won't see it so. When people behave most\nimproperly to you, are you bound to stand upon propriety with them? Just\nanswer me that, if you can, Mrs. Gilham. My mind is quite settled by\nthat consideration. I'll go in for it wholesale, Binstock and all, if\nhe means a five-pound note for every stripe in his waistcoat.\"\n\n\"Mr. Binstock is much too grand to wear a striped waistcoat;\" said Frank\nwith the gravity of one who understands his subject. \"But he goes to see\nhis parents every Wednesday. And he will not be wronged in reality, for\nit will be worth all that to him, for the rise he will get by his\nabsence.\"\n\n\"Binstock's parents! Why he must be over sixty!\" exclaimed Frank's\nmother in amazement. She had greatly undervalued her son's knowledge.\n\n\"They are both in the poorhouse at Pumpington, the father eighty-five\nand the mother eighty-two. They married too early in life,\" said Frank,\n\"and each of their fifteen children leaves the duty of supporting them\nto the other fourteen. Our Binstock is the most filial of the whole, for\nhe takes his parents two ounces of tobacco every Wednesday.\"\n\n\"The inhuman old miser!\" cried Miss Fox. \"He shall never have two pence\nout of me. That settles it. Mr. Frank, try for Wednesday.\"\n\n\"Well, Frank, you puzzle me altogether,\" said Mrs. Gilham with some\nannoyance. \"To think of your knowing all those things, and never telling\nyour own mother!\"\n\n\"I never talk of my neighbour's affairs, until they become my own\nbusiness.\" Frank pulled up his collars, and Christie said to herself\nthat his mind was very large. \"But don't run away with the idea, mother,\nthat I ever pry into such small matters. I know them by the merest\naccident. You know that the gamekeeper offers me a day or two when the\nwoodcocks come in; and Batts detests old Binstock. But he is on the very\nbest terms with Charles, and Bob, and Tamar Haddon. Through them I can\nmanage it perhaps for Wednesday, if Miss Fox thinks fit to entrust me\nwith the matter.\"\n\nIt happened that Lady Waldron held an important council with Mr. Webber,\non the following Wednesday. She had long begun to feel the helplessness,\nand sad disadvantages of her position, as a foreigner who had never even\ntried to understand the Country in which she lived, or to make friends\nof any of the people round her. And this left her so much the more at\nthe mercy of that dawdling old solicitor.\n\n\"Oh that I could only find my dear brother!\" was the constant cry of her\nsorrow, and her wrath. \"I wonder that he does not rush to help me. He\nwould have done so long ago, if he had only known of this.\"\n\n\"No reply, no reply yet?\" she asked, after listening, with patience that\nsurprised herself, to the lawyer's long details of nothing, and\nexcellent reasons for doing still less. \"Are you certain that you have\nhad my demand, my challenge, my supplication to my only brother entered\nin all the Spanish journals, the titles of which I supplied to you? And\nentered in places conspicuous?\"\n\n\"In every one of them, madam, with instructions that all replies should\nbe sent to the office of the paper, and then direct to you. Therefore\nyou would receive them, and not our firm. Shall we try in any other\ncountry?\"\n\n\"Yes, oh yes! That is very good indeed. I was thinking of that only\nyesterday. My brother has much love for Paris sometimes, whenever he is\nin good--in affluence, as your expression is. For I have not concealed\nfrom you, Mr. Webber, that although of the very first families of Spain,\nthe Count is not always--through caprice of fortune, his resources are\ndisposed to rise and fall. You should therefore try Paris, and Lyons,\nand Marseilles. It is not in my power to present the names of the\nprincipal journals. But they can be discovered, even in this country.\"\n\nMr. Webber was often hard put to it, by the lady's calm assumption that\nbarbarism is the leading characteristic of an Englishman. For Theodore\nWebber was no time-server; only bound by his duty to the firm, and his\nsense of loyal service to a client of lofty memory. And he knew that he\ncould take the lead of any English lady, because of her knowledge of his\ncharacter, and the way in which he pronounced it. But with this Spanish\nlady, all his really solid manner, and true English style were thrown\naway.\n\n\"Even in this country, madam, we know the names of the less enlightened\nJournals of the Continent. They are hard to read because of the\nmiserable paper they are printed on; but my younger son has the gift of\nlanguages, and nothing is too outlandish for him. That also shall be\nattended to. And now about this question that arises between yourself\nand Mr. Penniloe?\"\n\n\"I will not yield. I will sign nothing. Everything shall be as my\nhusband did intend. And who can declare what that was, a stranger, or\nhis own wife, with the most convincing?\"\n\n\"Yes, madam, that is true enough. But according to English law, we are\nbound by the words of the will; and unless those are doubtful, no\nevidence of intention is admissible, and even then----\"\n\n\"I will not be bound by a--by an adaptation of words that was never\nintended. What has a heretic minister to do with my family, and with\nWalderscourt?\"\n\n\"But, madam, excuse me. Sir Thomas Waldron asked you, and you consented,\nto the appointment of the Rev. Philip Penniloe, as your co-executor, and\nco-trustee for your daughter, Miss Inez.\"\n\n\"If I did, it was only to please my husband, because he was in pain so\nsevere. It should have been my brother, or else my son. I have said to\nyou before, that after all that has been done, I refuse to adhere to\nthat interpretation.\"\n\nThe solicitor fixed his eyes on her, not in anger, but in pure\nastonishment. He had deep grey eyes in a rugged setting, with large\nwrinkles under, and dark gabled brows above; and he had never met a lady\nyet--except his own wife--who was not overpowered by their solemn\nwisdom. Lady Waldron was not overpowered by them. In her ignorance of\nEnglish usage, she regarded this gentleman of influence and trust, as no\nmore than a higher form of Binstock.\n\n\"I shall have to throw it up,\" said Mr. Webber to himself; \"but oh, what\ngorgeous picking, for that very low-principled Bubb and Cockshalt!\" The\neminent firm he thought of thus were always prepared to take anything he\nmissed.\n\n\"Your ladyship is well aware,\" he said, being moved by that last\nreflection, \"that we cannot have anything perfect in this world, but\nmust take things as we find them. Mr. Penniloe is a most reasonable man,\nand acknowledges the value of my experience. He will not act in any way\nagainst your wishes, so far as may be in conformity with sound legal\npractice. That is the great point for us to consider, laying aside all\nearly impressions--which are generally loose when examined--of--of\nContinental codes, and so on. We need not anticipate any trouble from\nyour co-executor, who as a clergyman is to us a layman, if proper\nconfidence is reposed in us. Already we are taking the regular steps to\nobtain Probate of a very simple will, prepared very carefully in our\nOffice, and by exceedingly skilful hands. We act for Mr. Penniloe, as\nwell as for your ladyship. All is proceeding very smoothly, and exactly\nas your dear husband would have wished.\"\n\n\"Then he would have wished to have his last rest dishonoured, and his\ndaughter estranged from her own mother.\"\n\n\"The young lady will probably come round, madam, as soon as you\nencourage her. Your mind is the stronger of the two, in every way. With\nregard to that sad and shameful outrage, we are doing everything that\ncan be done. We have very little doubt that if matters are left to our\njudgment, and discreet activity----\"\n\n\"Activity, sir! And what have you done? How long is it--a month? I\ncannot reckon time, because day and night are the same thing to me. Will\nyou never detect that abominable crime? Will you never destroy those\nblack miscreants? Will you never restore--oh, I cannot speak of it--and\nall the time you know who did it all! There is no word strong enough in\nyour poor tongue, for such an outcast monster. Yet he goes about, he\nattends to his business, they shake him by the hand, they smile at him;\ninstead of spit, they smile at him! And this is called a Christian land!\nMy God, what made You make it?\"\n\n\"I implore your ladyship not to be excited. Hitherto you have shown such\nself-command. Day and night, we are on the watch, and something must\nspeedily come of it. We have three modes of action, each one of them\nsure to be successful, with patience. But the point is this--to have no\nmistake about it, to catch him with evidence sufficient to convict him,\nand then to punish and disgrace him for ever.\"\n\n\"But how much longer before you will begin? I am so tired, so weary, so\nworn out--can you not see how it is destroying me?\"\n\nMr. Webber looked at her, and could not deny that this was a very\ndifferent Lady Waldron from the one who had scarcely deigned to bow to\nhim, only a few months ago. The rich warm colour had left her cheeks,\nthe large dark eyes were wan and sunken, weariness and dejection spread,\nwhere pride and strength of will had reigned. The lawyer replied in a\nbolder tone than he would have employed, last summer.\n\n\"Lady Waldron, we can do no more. If we attempted any stronger measures,\nthe only result would be to destroy our chance. If you think that any\nother firm, or any kind of agency, would conduct matters more to your\nsatisfaction, and more effectually than we have done, we would only ask\nyou to place it in their hands. I assure you, madam, that the business\nis not to our liking, or even to our benefit. For none but an old and\nmost valued client, would we have undertaken it. If you think proper, we\nwill withdraw, and hand over all information very gladly to our\nsuccessors.\"\n\n\"To whom can I go? Who will come to my rescue in this wicked, impious,\naccursed land? If my brother were here, is it possible to doubt what he\nwould do--how he would proceed? He would tear that young man, arm from\narm, and leg from leg, and lay him in the market-place, and shoot any\none who came to bury him. Listen, Mr. Webber, I live only for one\nthing--to find my noble brother, and to see him do that.\"\n\nThe lady stood up, with her eyebrows knitted, her dark eyes glowing, and\nher white hands thrown apart and quivering, evidently tearing an\nimaginary Jemmy.\n\n\"Let us hope for the best, madam, hope for the best, and pray for the\nblessing of the Almighty, upon our weak endeavours.\"\n\nThis was anything but a kind view to take of the dispersion of poor\nJemmy; but the lawyer was terrified for the moment by the lady's\nvehemence. That she who had hitherto always shown such self-command and\ndignity--he began to fear that there was too much truth in her account\nof the effect upon her.\n\nSuddenly, as if all her passion had been feigned--though none who had\nseen, or even heard her, could believe that possible--she returned to\nher tranquil, self-possessed, and even cold and distant style. The fire\nin her eyes, and the fury of her gestures sank and were gone, as if by\nmagic; and the voice became soft and musical, as the sound of a bell\nacross a summer sea.\n\n\"You will pardon me,\" she said, as she fell back into the chair, from\nwhich in her passion she had risen; \"but sometimes my trouble is more\ngreat than I can bear. Ladies of this country are so delicate and\ngentle, they cannot have much hatred, because they have no love. And yet\nthey can have insolence, very strong, and very wonderful. Yesterday, or\ntwo days ago, I obtained good proof of that. The sister of that man is\nhere--the man who has overwhelmed me thus--and she has written a letter\nto me, very quiet, very simple, very polite, requesting me to appoint an\ninterview for her in my own house;\"--this had been done on Monday, at\nthe suggestion of Frank Gilham, that fair means should be exhausted\nfirst--\"but after writing thus, she has the insulting to put in\nunder--something like this, I remember very well--'if you refuse to see\nme, I shall be compelled to come, without permission.' Reflect upon\nthat, Mr. Webber.\"\n\n\"Madam, it was not the proper thing to say. But ladies are, even when\nvery young, a little--perhaps a little inclined to do, what they are\ninclined to.\"\n\n\"I sent her letter back, without a word, by the insolent person who\nbrought it. Just in the same manner as her wicked brother's card. It is\nquite certain that she will never dare to enter into my presence.\"\n\n\"You have made a mistake there, Lady Waldron. Here I am, to thank you\nfor your good manners; and to speak a few truths, which you cannot\nanswer.\"\n\nChristie Fox walked up the room, with her eyes fixed steadfastly upon\nthe other's, made a very graceful curtsey, and stood, without even a\nribbon trembling. She was beautifully dressed, in dove-coloured silk,\nand looked like a dove, that has never been fluttered. All this Lady\nWaldron perceived at a glance; and knew that she had met her equal, in a\nbrave young Englishwoman.\n\nMr. Webber, who longed to be far away, jumped about with some agility,\nand manoeuvred not to turn his back upon either of the ladies, while he\nfetched a chair for the visitor. But his trouble was lost, for the\nyounger lady declined with a wave of her hand; while the elder\nsaid--\"Sir, I will thank you to ring the bell.\"\n\n\"That also is vain,\" said Miss Fox, calmly. \"I will not leave this room,\nLady Waldron, until I have told you my opinion of your conduct. The only\nquestion is--do you wish to hear it, in the presence of this gentleman;\nor do you wish me to wait until he is gone?\"\n\nTo all appearances, the lawyer was by far the most nervous of the three;\nand he made off for the door, but received a sign to stop.\n\n\"It is just as well, perhaps, that you should not be alone,\" Christie\nbegan in a clear firm voice, with her bright eyes flashing, so that the\ndark Spanish orbs were but as dead coals in comparison, \"and that you\nshould not be ashamed; because it proves at least that you are honest in\nyour lunatic conclusions. I am not speaking rudely. The greatest\nkindness that any one can do you, is to believe that you are mad.\"\n\nSo great was the force of her quiet conviction that Lady Waldron raised\none hand, and laid it upon her throbbing temples. For weeks she had been\nsleepless, and low, and feverish, dwelling on her wrongs in solitude,\nand estranged from her own daughter.\n\n\"Hush, hush, my good young lady!\" pleaded the old Solicitor; but his\nclient gazed heavily at her accuser, as if she could scarcely apprehend;\nand Christie thought that she did not care.\n\n\"You have done a most wicked thing;\" Miss Fox continued in a lower tone,\n\"as bad, in its way as the great wrong done to you. You have condemned\nan innocent man, ruined his life to the utmost of your power, and\nrefused to let him even speak for himself. Is that what you call\njustice?\"\n\n\"He was not innocent. He was the base miscreant. We have the proof of\nthe man who saw him.\"\n\nLady Waldron spoke slowly, in a strange dull tone, while her lips\nscarcely moved, and her hands fell on her lap.\n\n\"There is no such proof. The man owns his mistake. My brother can prove\nthat he was miles away. He was called to his father's sick bed, that\nvery night. And before daylight he was far upon the road. He never\nreturned till days afterwards. Then he finds this black falsehood; and\nyou for its author!\"\n\n\"Is there any truth in this?\"\n\nLady Waldron turned slightly towards Mr. Webber, as if she were glad to\nremove her eyes from her visitor's contemptuous and overpowering gaze.\n\n\"There may be some, madam. I believe it is true that the blacksmith has\nchanged his opinion, and that Dr. Fox was called suddenly away.\"\n\nThe old Solicitor was beginning to feel uneasy about his own share in\nthe matter. He had watched Miss Fox intently through his glasses; and\nlong experience in lawcourts told him, that she thoroughly believed\nevery word she uttered. He was glad that he had been so slow and\ncareful; and resolved to be more so, if possible, henceforth.\n\n\"And now if you are not convinced of the great wrong you have done,\"\nsaid Christie coming nearer, and speaking with a soft thrill in her\nvoice, for tears were not far distant; \"what have you to say to this? My\nbrother, long before your husband's death, even before the last illness,\nhad given his heart to your daughter Inez. Her father more than\nsuspected that, and was glad to think it likely. Inez also knew it well.\nAll this also I can prove, even to your satisfaction. Is it possible,\neven if he were a villain, and my brother is a gentleman of as good a\nfamily as your own, Lady Waldron--ask yourself, would he offer this\ndastard outrage to the father of the girl he loved? If you can believe\nit, you are not a woman. And that would be better for all other women.\nOh, it is too cruel, too atrocious, too inhuman! And you are the one who\nhas done it all. Lay this to heart--and that you may think of it, I will\nleave you to yourself.\"\n\nBrave as she was, she could not quite accomplish this. Is it a provision\nof Nature, that her highest production should be above the rules of\ninferior reason? When this fair young woman ceased to speak, and having\ndischarged her mission should have walked away in silence--strange to\nsay, she could do nothing of the kind. As if words had been her spring\nand motive power, no sooner were they exhausted than she herself broke\ndown entirely. She fell away upon the rejected chair, covered her face\nwith both hands, reckless of new kid gloves just come from Paris, and\nburst into a storm of tears and sobs.\n\n\"You have done it now,\" cried Mr. Webber; \"I thought you would; but you\nwouldn't be stopped.\" He began to rush about helplessly, not on account\nof the poor girl's plight--for he had wife and daughter of his own, and\nknew that tears are never fatal, but often highly beneficial; \"you have\ndone it now; I thought you would.\" His prophetic powers seemed to\nconsole him.\n\nChristie looked up through her dabbled gloves, and saw a sight that\nfrightened her. Lady Waldron had been sitting at a large oak table\ncovered with books and papers,--for the room was chiefly used for\nbusiness, and not a lady's bower--and there she sat still; but with this\nchange, that she had been living, and now was dead. Dead to all\nperception of the life and stir around her, dead to all sense of right\nor wrong, of daylight or of darkness; but living still to the slow sad\nwork that goes on in the body, when the mind is gone. Her head lay back\non the stout oak rail; her comely face showed no more life than granite\nhas, or marble; and her widow's hood dropped off, and shed the coils of\nher long black hair around.\n\n\"I can't make it out;\" cried Mr. Webber, hurrying to the bell-rope,\nwhich he pulled to such purpose that the staple of the crank fell from\nthe ceiling, and knocked him on the head. But Christie, recovering at a\nglance, ran round the end of the table, and with all her strength\nsupported the tottering figure.\n\nWhat she did afterwards, she never knew, except from the accounts of\nothers; for she was too young to have presence of mind, when every one\nelse was distracted. But from all that they said--and they were all\nagainst her--she must have shown readiness, and strength, and judgment,\nand taken Mr. Webber under her command.\n\nOne thing she remembered, because it was so bitter, and so frightfully\nunjust; and if there was anything she valued--next to love and truth and\nhonour, most of which are parts of it--Christie valued simple justice,\nand impartiality. To wit--as Mr. Webber might have put it--when she ran\nout to find Mr. Gilham, who had been left there, only because he did not\nchoose to go away, and she only went to find him that he might run for\nDr. Gronow--there was her brother standing with him, and words less\nfriendly than usual were, as it seemed to her, passing between them.\n\n\"No time for this sort of thing now,\" she said, as well as her flurried\ncondition would permit; and then she pulled her brother in, and sent\nFrank, who was wonderfully calm and reasonable, to fetch that other\ndoctor too. Her brother was not in a nice frame of mind, according to\nher recollection; and there was no time to reason with him, if he chose\nto be so stupid. Therefore she sent him where he was wanted; and of\ncourse no doctor could refuse to go, under such frightful circumstances.\nBut as for herself, she felt as if it mattered very little what she did;\nand so she went and sat somewhere in the dark, without even a dog for\ncompany, and finished with many pathetic addenda the good cry that had\nbeen broken off.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\nA MAGIC LETTER.\n\n\n\"Oh here you are at last then, are you?\" said somebody entering the room\nwith a light, by the time the young lady had wept herself dry, and was\nbeginning to feel hungry; \"what made you come here? I thought you were\ngone. To me it is a surprising thing, that you have the assurance to\nstay in this house.\"\n\n\"Oh, Jemmy, how can you be so cruel, when every bit of it was for you?\"\n\n\"For me indeed! I am very much obliged. For your own temper, I should\nsay. Old Webber says that if she dies, there may be a verdict of\nmanslaughter.\"\n\n\"I don't care two pins, if there is; when all the world is so unjust to\nme. But how is she, Jemmy? What has happened to her? What on earth is it\nall about?\"\n\n\"Well, I think you ought to know that best. Webber says he never heard\nany one like you, in all his experience of Criminal Courts.\"\n\n\"Much I care what he says--the old dodderer! You should have seen him\nhopping about the room, like a frog with the rheumatism. You should have\nseen him stare, when the bell-rope fell. When I said the poor thing's\nhands were cold, he ran and poked the fire with his spectacles. But\ncan't you tell me how she is? Surely I have a right to know, if I am to\nbe manslaughtered.\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied Dr. Fox, with that heavy professional nod which he\nridiculed in others; \"she is in a very peculiar state. No one can tell\nwhat may come of it.\"\n\n\"Not a fit, Jemmy? Not like dear father's; not a mild form of--no, it\nseemed quite different.\"\n\n\"It is a different thing altogether, though proceeding probably from the\nbrain. An attack of what we call catalepsy. Not at all a common thing,\nand quite out of my own experience, though I know of it from the books a\nlittle. Gronow knew it, of course, at a glance. Fortunately I had sense\nenough not to try any strong measures till he came. Any other young\nfellow in this part of the world would have tried venesection instantly,\nand it might have killed her. My treatment happened to be quite right,\nfrom my acquaintance with principles. It is nothing less than a case of\nentirely suspended animation. How long it may last, none can foretell.\"\n\n\"But you don't think it will kill her, Jemmy? Why my animation was\nsuspended ever so long, the other day----\"\n\n\"That was quite a different thing--this proceeds from internal action,\noverpowering emotion in a very an\u00c3\u00a6mic condition; yours was simply\nexternal concussion, operating on a rather highly charged----\"\n\n\"You are very polite. My own fault in fact. Who gave me the horse to\ndrive about? But surely if a disordered brain like mine contrives to get\nright again----\"\n\n\"Christie, I wish to do you good. You have brought me into a frightful\nmess, because you are so headlong. But you meant it for the best, I\nknow; and I must not be too hard upon you.\"\n\n\"What else have you been for the last five minutes? Oh, Jemmy, Jemmy, I\nam so sorry! Give me a kiss, and I will forgive you.\"\n\n\"You are a very quick, warmhearted girl; and such have never too much\nreason.\"\n\nThe Doctor kissed his sister, in a most magnanimous manner; and she\nbelieved implicitly (until the next time of argument) that she had done\nthe injury, and her brother sweetly borne it.\n\n\"Now come, while it is hot,\" said he; \"get your courage up, and come.\nNever let a wound grow cold. Between you two there must be no ill-will;\nand she is so noble.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed! Who is it then? It is so good, and so elevating to be\nbrought into contact with those wonderfully lofty people.\"\n\n\"It is exactly what you want. If you can only obtain her friendship, it\nwill be the making of your character.\"\n\n\"For goodness' sake, don't lose a moment. I feel myself already growing\nbetter, nobler, loftier.\"\n\n\"There is nothing in you grave, and stable, none of the stronger\nelements;\" said the Doctor, as he led the way along an empty passage.\n\n\"Don't you be too sure of that;\" his sister answered, in a tone which he\nremembered afterwards.\n\nLady Waldron lay on a broad and solid sofa, well-prepared for her; and\nthere was no sign left of life or movement in her helpless figure. She\nwas not at all like \"recumbent marble\"--which is the ghost of death\nitself--neither was she stiff or straight; but simply still, and in such\na condition, that however any part of her frame might be placed, so it\nwould remain; submissive only to the laws of gravitation, and to no\nexercise of will, if will were yet surviving. The face was as pale as\ndeath, the eyes half open but without expression; the breathing scarcely\nperceptible, and the pulse like the flutter of eider down, or gossamer\nin a sheltered spot.\n\nThere was nothing ghastly, repulsive, or even greatly distressing at\nfirst sight; for the fine, and almost perfect, face had recovered in\nplacid abandonment the beauty impaired by grief and passion. And yet the\ndim uncertainty, the hovering between life and death, the touching\nfrailty of human power over-tried and vanquished, might move the\nbitterest foe to tears, and waken the compassion planted in all human\nhearts by heaven.\n\nChristie was no bitter foe, but a kind impulsive generous maiden,\nrushing at all hazards to defend the right, ready to bite the dust when\nin the wrong, if properly convinced of it. Jemmy stepped back, and\nspread forth his hand more dramatically than was needed, as much as to\nsay--\"See what you have done! Never forget this, while you live. I leave\nyou to self-abasement.\"\n\nThe sensitive and impetuous girl required no such admonishment. She fell\non her knees, and took one cold hand, while her face turned as pale as\nthe one she watched. The pity of the sight became more vivid, deep, and\noverpowering; and she whispered her little bedside prayer, for that was\nthe only one she recalled. Then she followed it up with confession.\n\n\"I know what ought to be done to me. I ought to be taken by the\nneck--no, that's not right--I ought to be taken to the place of\nexecution, and there hanged by the neck, till I am dead, dead, dead.\"\n\nAll this she may have deserved, but what she got was very different.\n\nAround her bended neck was flung no hangman's noose, but a gentle arm,\nthe softest and loveliest ever felt, while dark eyes glistened into her\nown, and seeming to be encouraged there, came closer through a\nclustering bower; and in less time than it takes to tell, two fair young\nfaces touched each other, and two quick but heavy hearts were throbbing\nvery close together.\n\n\"It is more my fault than yours,\" said Nicie, leading the way to another\nroom, when a few soft words of comfort and good-will had passed; \"I am\nthe one who has done all this; and Dr. Gronow says so--or at least he\nwould, if he said what he thinks. It was the low condition caused by\nlong and lonely thinking, and the want of sufficient food and air, and\nthe sense of having no one, not even me.\"\n\n\"But that was her fault. She discouraged you; she showed no affection\nfor you; she was even very angry with you; because you dared to think\ndifferently, because you had noble faith and trust.\"\n\n\"For that I deserve no credit, because I could not help it. But I might\nhave been kinder to her, Christie; I might have shown less pride and\ntemper. I might have said to myself more often--'she is sadly shattered;\nand she is my mother.' It will teach me how to behave another time. For\nif she does not get well, and forgive me, I shall never forgive myself.\nI must have forgotten how much easier it is, to be too hard, than to be\ntoo soft.\"\n\n\"Probably you never thought about it;\" said Christie, who knew a great\ndeal about what were then called \"the mental processes\"--now gone into\nmuch bigger names, but the same nut in a harder shell. \"You acted\naccording to your sense of right; and that meant what you felt was\nright; and that came round to mean--Jemmy.\"\n\nNicie, who never examined her mind--perhaps the best thing to be done\nwith it--was not quite satisfied with this abruptly concrete view of the\nissue. \"Perhaps, I did,\" she said and sighed; because everything felt so\ncloudy.\n\n\"Whatever you did--you are a darling;\" said the more experienced one.\n\"There is a lot of trouble before us both. Never mind, if we only stick\ntogether. Poor Jemmy believes that he is a wonder. Between us, we will\nfetch him down.\"\n\nNicie could perceive no call for that, being as yet of less practical\nturn. She was of that admirable, and too rare, and yearly diminishing,\ntype of women, who see and feel that Heaven meant them, not to contend\nwith and outdo, but to comfort, purify, and ennoble that stronger,\ncoarser, and harder half, called men.\n\n\"I think that he wants fetching up,\" she said, with very graceful\ntimidity; \"but his sister must know best, of course. Is it right to talk\nof such things now?\"\n\n\"Decidedly not;\" Miss Fox replied. \"In fact it is downright wicked. But\nsomehow or other, I always go astray. Whenever I am out of sorts with\nmyself, I take a turn at other people. But how many turns must I have at\nothers before I get my balance now! Did you ever see anything so sad?\nBut how very beautiful she is! I never noticed it this afternoon,\nbecause I was in such a rage, I suppose. How long is she likely to\nremain like this?\"\n\n\"Dr. Gronow cannot say. He has known one case which lasted for a month.\nBut then there was no consciousness at all. He thinks that there is a\nlittle now. But we can perceive no sign of it.\"\n\n\"Well, I think I did. I am almost sure I did;\" Christie answered\neagerly; \"when I said 'dead, dead, dead,' in that judicial manner, there\ncame a little gleam of light into her eyes, as if she approved of the\nsentence. And again when you called me your sister, there seemed to be a\nsparkle of astonishment, as if she thought you were in too much of a\nhurry; and perhaps you were, my darling. Oh, what a good judge Jemmy is!\nNo wonder he is getting so conceited.\"\n\n\"If there is any consciousness at all,\" said Nicie, avoiding that other\nsubject, \"this trance (if that is the English word for it) will not last\nlong--at least Dr. Gronow says so; and Doctor Jemmy--what a name for a\ngentleman of science!--thoroughly confirms it. But Dr. Fox is so\ndiffident and modest, that he seems to wait for his friend's opinion;\nthough he must know more, being younger.\"\n\n\"Certainly he ought,\" Miss Fox replied, with a twinkle of dubious\nimport; \"I hear a great deal of such things. No medical man is ever at\nhis prime, unless it is at thirty-nine years and a half. Under forty, he\ncan have no experience, according to the general public; and over forty\nhe is on the shelf, according to his own Profession. For that one year,\nthey ought to treble all their fees.\"\n\n\"That would only be fair; for they always charge too little.\"\n\n\"You are an innocent duck;\" said Christie. \"There is a spot on your\ncheek that I must kiss; because it always comes, when you hear the name\nof Jemmy. Abstract affection for unknown science. Oh do have a try at\nDr. Gronow. He knows fifty times as much as poor Jemmy.\"\n\n\"But he doesn't know how to please me,\" replied Nicie; \"and I suppose\nthat ought to count for something; after all. I must go and tell him\nwhat you thought you saw. That is his step in the passage now; and he\nordered us to watch for any symptoms of that sort. Oh what will he think\nof me, for leaving Nurse alone? Good night, dear Christie; I shall come\naway no more. But Binstock, our great man, is come back. He will attend\nto you, and see that you don't go home starving, or by yourself.\"\n\n\"Positive statements suit young men,\" Dr. Gronow declared, as he\nbuttoned up his coat, about an hour afterwards; \"and so does sitting up\nall night. Fox, you had better act up to that. But I shall just see your\nsister safe, as far as the hospitable White Post, and then I shall go\nhome to my supper. There is not the slightest danger now, but constant\nattention is needful, in case of sudden revival. That I do not at all\nexpect; but you know what to do, if it happens. The third day will be\nthe most likely time; and then any pleasing excitement, or\nattraction--but I shall be here, and see to that.\"\n\n\"Oh Dr. Gronow,\" exclaimed Miss Fox, as she fastened her cloak to go\nwith him; \"how I wish I had been born a little sooner, to see you more\npositive than you are now!\"\n\n\"Miss Fox, it is a happy thing for me, that I anticipated all such\nviews. Young ladies, I meant of course--and not young men. Yet alas, the\nyoung ladies are too negative.\"\n\nOn the third day from Lady Waldron's seizure, the postman of the name of\nWalker finding not even a mushroom left to retard the mail-delivery, and\nhaving a cold north wind at his back, brought to the house, soon after\nnoon, a very large letter, marked \"Ship Despatch. Two shillings and\ntenpence to pay,\" and addressed to Lady Waldron.\n\n\"It must be from dear Tom,\" pronounced Nicie; \"we have not heard from\nhim since he sailed for India. There is no other person in the world,\ncapable of such a frightful scrawl.\"\n\n\"Why, this is the very thing we want,\" said Gronow, who was present\naccording to promise; \"large, conspicuous, self-assertive. Let somebody\nfetch me a green flower-stick.\"\n\nSlitting one end of the stick, he inserted the lower edge of the letter,\nand fixed it upright in the scroll-work at the bottom of the couch. Then\nhe drew the curtain back, and a slant of cheerful sunshine broke upon\nthe thick bold writing. But the figure on the couch lay still, without a\nsign of interest, cold, rigid, and insensible.\n\n\"I'll keep out of sight,\" the Doctor whispered, \"and let no one say a\nword. But presently when I hold my hand up, let Miss Nicie strike a few\nnotes, not too rapidly, on her guitar--some well-known Spanish melody.\"\n\nGliding round the back of the couch, with a very gentle touch he raised\nthe unconscious lady's head, and propped it with a large firm pillow; so\nthat the dim half-open eyes were level with and set point-blank upon the\nshining letter. Securing it so, he withdrew a little, and held up his\nhand to Nicie.\n\nShe, upon a low chair further off, touched the strings of her mother's\nown and in younger days much loved guitar; gently at first, like a\ndistant ripple; then with a strong bold swell arising into a grand\nmelodious strain--the March of Andalusia. All present held their breath\nto watch, and saw a strange and moving sight.\n\nThe Spanish lady's eyes began to fill with soft and quivering light,\nlike a lake when the moon is rising; the fringe of their dark lashes\nrose; a little smile played on her lips, and touched them with a living\ntint; then all the brilliance of her gaze flashed forth, and fastened on\nthat letter. She lifted both her trembling hands, and the letter was put\ninto them. Her face was lit with vivid joy, and her lips pronounced--\"My\nson, my son!\" Then wanting nothing more, she drew the precious token to\nher breast, concealed it there, and sank into profound, and tranquil,\nand sweet sleep.\n\n\"She will be all right, when she awakes, and then she will want a lot of\nfood;\" said Dr. Gronow with a quiet grin, while Nicie and Chris wept\ntears of joy, and Dr. Fox and the Nurse looked queer. \"Mind she can't\nlive on her son's letter. Beef-tea, arrowroot, and port-wine, leg of\nmutton gravy, and neat's foot jelly--finer than the sweetest\nsweetheart's letters, let alone a boy who writes with the stump of a\ncigar. Ladies and gentlemen, my job is over; what a blessing Penniloe is\ngone to London! We should have had a prayer meeting every day. Miss Fox,\nI think I shall call you 'Christie,' because you are so unchristian.\"\n\n\"You may call me anything you like--that is so long as it is something\nyou do like. I shall almost begin to have faith in doctors now, in spite\nof poor Jemmy being one.\"\n\n\"Jemmy, you had better throw up the trade. Your sister understands it\nbest. The hardest work, and the hardest paid--however I go a\ntrout-fishing, ere ever the river freezes.\"\n\nThe wind was very cold, and everybody there shivered at the shudders he\nwould have to undergo, as they saw him set forth with an eager step. He\nwaved his hand back from a turn of the walk which reminded him of the\nriver, and his shoulders went up, as if he had a trout on hook.\n\n\"He is happy. Let him be,\" said the percipient Christie; \"he won't catch\nanything in fact; but the miraculous draught in fancy.\"\n\n\"He ought to be pitched in,\" replied her brother, who was put out about\nsomething, possibly the fingering of the second fiddle; \"the least that\ncan be done to him is to pitch him in, for trying to catch trout in\nDecember. Pike had vowed to do it; but those fellows are gone home,\nHopper and all, just when the world was most in want of them. Christie,\nyou will just come back with me, to the Old Barn.\"\n\n\"Why does Dr. Gronow address nearly all his very excellent remarks to\nme? And why does he always look at me, when he speaks?\"\n\n\"Because you are so pretty, dear. And because you catch his meaning\nfirst. They like that sort of thing;\" said Nicie.\n\n\"For looks I am nowhere, with Nicie present. But he sees advanced\nintelligence in me. And he comes from where they appreciate it. I shall\ngo back to Old Barn, just when I think right.\"\n\n\"We are coming to something!\" cried Doctor Jemmy, who looked pleasantly,\nbut loftily, at all the female race--save Nicie, who was saved perhaps,\ntill two months after marriage--\"stay, if you like, where you are\nappreciated, so highly, so very highly.\"\n\nChristie's face became red as a rose, for really this was too bad on his\npart, and after all she had done for him, as witnessed those present.\n\n\"They like me,\" she said in an off-handed manner; \"and I like\nthem--which is more than one can do to everybody. But it makes very\nlittle difference, I am afraid, for I shall never see them any more,\nunless they come to Foxden. I had made up my mind to go home, the moment\nLady Waldron was out of danger. I did not come here to please myself;\nand this is all I get for it. Good-bye to fair Perlycross to-morrow!\nOne must not neglect one's dear father and mother, even for--even for\nsuch a dear as Nicie.\"\n\n\"Well, I never knew what it was to be out of temper.\" There was some\ntruth in this assertion, though it seems a large one; for Jemmy Fox had\na remarkably sweet temper; and a man who takes stock of himself, when\nshort of that article, has already almost replaced it. \"But how will you\ngo, my dear little Cayenne pepper? Will you pack up all your grandeur,\nand have a coach and four?\"\n\n\"Yes that I will,\" answered Christie quick as light, \"though it won't\ncost me quite as much as the one I hired, when I came post-haste to your\nrescue. The name of my coach is the _Defiance_; and the Guard shall play\n'Roast-beef' all the way, in honour of the coming Christmas-time. Won't\nwe have a fine time at Foxden, if father is in good health again?\"\n\nJemmy wisely left her to her own devices--for she generally \"took the\nchange out of him\"--and consoled himself with soft contemplation of a\nlovelier, nicer, and (so far as he knew yet) ten thousand times\nsweeter-tempered girl, whose name was Nicie Waldron.\n\nNow that sweet creature had a worry of her own, though she did not\nafflict the public with it. She was dying with anxiety, all the time, to\nknow the contents of her brother Tom's letter, which had so enlivened\nher dear mother.\n\nIt is said that the only thing the all-wise Solomon could not explain to\nthe Queen of Sheba, was the process of her own mind, or rather perhaps\nthe leaps of it, which landed her in conclusions quite correct, yet\nunsupported even by the shadow of an enthymem. Miss Waldron was not so\nclever as the Queen of Sheba, or even as Miss Christie Fox; yet she had\narrived at a firm conviction that the one, who was destined to solve the\nsad and torturing question about her dear father, was no other than her\nbrother, Tom Rodrigo. She had observed that his letter bore no token of\nthe family bereavement, neither was that to be expected yet, although\nsix weeks had now elapsed since the date of their sore distress.\n\nEnvelopes was not as yet in common use, and a letter was a cumbrous and\nclumsy-looking thing, one of the many reasons being that a writer was\nbound by economy, and very often by courtesy as well, to fill three\ngreat pages, before he began to double in. This naturally led to a vast\nsprawl of words, for the most part containing very little; and \"what\nshall I say next?\" was the constant enquiry of even the most loving\ncorrespondent. Nicie knew well, that her brother was not gifted with the\npen of a ready writer, and that all his heart indited of was--\"what\nshall I put, to get done with it?\" This increased the value of his\nletters (by means of their rarity) and also their interest, according to\nthe canon that plenty of range should be allowed for the reader's\nimagination.\n\nBut now even too much range was left, for that of the affectionate and\npoetic maiden, inasmuch as her mother lay asleep for hours with this\nfine communication to support her heart. There was nothing for Nicie to\ndo, except to go to sleep patiently on her own account, and that she did\nin her own white bed, and saw a fair vision through tears of joy.\n\nBehold, she was standing at the door, the sacred portal of Walderscourt,\ngazing at trees that were full of singing birds, with her milk-white\npony cropping clover honey-sweet, and _Pixie_ teetotuming after his own\ntail. All the air was blossoming with dance of butterflies, and all the\nearth was laughing at the flatteries of the sun. And behold a very tall\nform arose, from beyond the weeping willow, leading a form yet taller,\nand looking back for fear of losing it. Then a loud voice shouted, and\nit was brother Tom's--\"Here he is at last! No mistake about it. I have\nfound the Governor--hurrah, hurrah!\" The maiden sprang up with a\nbounding heart, to embrace her darling father. But alas, there was\nnothing, except the cold moon, and a pure virgin bosom that glistened\nwith tears.\n\nWhen Tom's letter came to the reading at last, there was plenty of blots\nin it, and brown sand, but not a blessed bit of poetry. The youth had\nbeen at Eton, and exhausted there all the tendency of his mind towards\nmetre. Even now people, who ought to know better, ask why poetry will\nnot go down with the tall, and imaginative, and romantic public. It must\nbe from the absence of the spark divine among them. Nay rather because\nere they could spell, their flint was fixed for life, with the \"fire\"\nused up by Classic hammer.\n\nOf these things the present Sir Thomas Rodrigo Waldron had neither\nthought nor heed. For him it was enough to be released; and the less he\nsaw of book and pen, for the rest of his natural life, the better for\nthe book, the pen, and him. So that on the whole he deserved much\ncredit, and obtained even more (from his mother) as the author of the\nfollowing fine piece of correspondence. Though all the best bits were\nadapted from a book, entitled \"The young man's polite letter-writer, to\nhis parents, sisters, sweethearts, friends, and the Minister of his\nnative parish, etc., etc.--also when applying for increase of wages.\"\n\n\n\"Valetta, in the Island of Malta, Mediterranean Sea, etc. November\nthe 5th, also Guy Fawkes' Day, A.D. 1835.\n\n\"MY BELOVED AND RESPECTED MOTHER,--I take up my pen with mingled\nfeelings of affection and regret. The bangs\"--oh, he ought to say\n\"pangs,\" thought Nicie, as her mother read it on most gravely--\"which I\nhave suffered, and am suffering still, arise from various sources.\nAffection, because of your unceasing and unmerited parental goodness;\nregret because absence in a foreign land enhances by a hundred fold the\nvalue of all those lost endearments. I hope that you will think of me,\nwhenever you sit on the old bench by the door, and behold the sun\nsetting in the east.\"\n\n\"It is very beautiful,\" said Lady Waldron, animated by a cup of strong\nbeef-tea; \"but Rodrigo was so hard to kiss. Very often, I have knocked\nmy head--but he is competent to feel it in his own head now.\"\n\n\"Mother, there is no bench by the door. And how can the sun set in the\neast? Oh I see it was 'west,' and he has scratched it out, because of\nhis being in the east himself.\"\n\n\"That means the same thing;\" replied Lady Waldron; \"Inez, if you intend\nto find fault with your dear brother's letter about such trifles, you\ndeserve to hear no more of it.\"\n\n\"Mother, as if it made any difference where the sun sets; so long as he\ncan see it!\"\n\n\"He always had large thoughts,\" reflected his mother; \"he is not of this\ncold geography. Hearken how beautifully he proceeds to write--\n\n\"'But it is vain to indulge these contemplations. Thanks to your\ncareful tuition, and the lofty example set before me, I trust that I\nshall never be found wanting in my duty to the Country that gave me\nbirth. Unfortunately in these foreign parts, the price of every article\nis excessive; and although I am guided, as you are well aware, by the\nstrictest principles of economy, my remembrance of what is due to you,\nand the position of a highly respected family, have in some degree\nnecessitated an anticipation of resources. Feeling assured of your\nsympathy, and that it will assume a practical form by return of post, I\nventure to state for your guidance that the house of Plumper, Wiggins,\nand Golightly in this City have been advised, and have consented to\nreceive on my behalf a remittance of \u00c2\u00a3120, which will, I trust, appear a\nvery reasonable sum.'\"\n\n\"Mother, dear mother, let me go on,\" cried Nicie, as the letter dropped\nfrom her mother's hand; \"the pleasure and excitement have been too much\nfor you, although the style is so excellent.\"\n\n\"It is not the style; but my breath has been surprised, by--by the\nexpressions of that last sentence. The sum that I myself placed to his\ncredit, out of my bonds of the City of Corduba, was in addition, and\nwithout his father's knowledge--but no doubt he will give explanation\nmore further down; though the writing appears now to become of a\ndifferent kind, shorter and less polished. But why is he in Malta, when\nthe ship sailed for Bombay? Oh I am terrified there will be some war.\nThe English can never stay without fighting very long. And behold his\nletter seems to go into three pieces! See now, it is quite crooked,\nInez, and of less correction. Nevertheless I approve more of it so.\nListen again, child.\n\n\"'I was almost forgeting to say that we were mett before we had got very\nfar on our way by a Despatch Vessle bringing urgent orders for all of\nthe Draught to be sent to this place, which is not half so hot as the\nother place would be, and much more convenient, and healthy but too\nwhite. But it does make the money fly, and they are a jolley sett. I\nhave long been wanting to write home, but waited untill there was some\nnews to tell, and we could tell where we are going next. But we shall\nhave to stay here for some time, because most of our things were sent\nto West Indies, and the other part went on to East India. It will all be\nfor the best because so strong a change of climate will be almost\ncertain to destroy the moths. I have bought three dogs. There is a new\nsort here, very clever, and can almost speak. I hope all the dogs at\nhome are well. I miss the shooting very much, and there are no horses in\nthe Mediterranean big enough to cary me. Now I must conclude with best\nlove and duty to the Governor and you, and Nicie, and old nurse\nSweetland, and anybody else who inquires for\n\n\"'remaining your affectionate and dutiful Son,\n\n\"'TOM R. WALDRON.\n\n\"'P.S.--Your kind letter of Aug. 30th just come. They must be very\nclever to have found us here. I am dredfully cutt up to hear dear\nGovernor not at all well when you wrote. Shall hope for better news\nevery day. There is a Greek gentleman here with a pill waranted to cure\neverything yet discovered. They are as large as yellow sluggs, and just\nthe same shape. He will let me have 10 for my amathist studds which are\nno good to me. Shall try to send them by the next ship that goes home.\nDo write at once, because I never heard before of anything wrong with\ndear Governor.\n\n\"'T. R. W.'\"\n\n\n\"Poor darling!\" said his mother with tears in her eyes, while Nicie was\nsobbing quietly; \"by this time he may be aware of it perhaps, though not\nof the dreadful thing that happened since. It will not be for his\nhappiness that he should ever know. Remember that, Inez. He is of so\nmuch vigour and high blood of the best Andalusian, that he would become\ninsane, and perhaps do himself deep injury. He would cast away his\noffice--what you call the Commission,--and come back to this country,\nand be put in prison for not accepting quietly the sacrilegious laws.\"\n\n\"Mother, you have promised never to speak of that subject. If it is too\nmuch for poor Tom, what is it likely to be for us? All we can do is to\nleave it to God.\"\n\n\"There is not the same God in this Country as we have. If there was, He\nwould never endure it.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\nA WAGER.\n\n\nIt was true enough that Mr. Penniloe was gone to London, as Gronow said.\nBut it was not true that otherwise he would have held a prayer-meeting\nevery day in Lady Waldron's room, for the benefit of her case. He would\nhave been a great support and strength to Inez in her anxiety, and\ndoubtless would have joined his prayers with hers; that would have been\nenough for him. Dr. Gronow was a man who meant well upon the whole, but\nnot in every crick and cranny, as a really fine individual does. But the\nParson was even less likely than the Doctor, to lift a latch plugged by\na lady against him.\n\n\"Thyatira, do you think that you could manage to see to the children,\nand the butcher's bill, during the course of next week,\" he enquired,\nwhen the pupils were off for their holiday, with accordions, and\npan-pipes and pea-shooters; \"I have particular business in London. Only\nBetty Cork, and old Job Tapscott, have come to my readings of Solomon's\nSong, and both of them are as deaf as milestones. Master Harry will be\nhome again in three days' time, and when he is in the house you have no\nfear; though your confidence should be placed much higher. Master\nMichael is stronger of late, and if we can keep shocking stories from\nhim, his poor little head may be right again. There really has been no\nproof at all of the existence of any Spring-heeled Jack; and he would\nnever come here to earn his money. He may have been mentioned in\nProphecy, as the Wesleyan Minister declared, but I have failed to come\nacross the passage. Our Church does not deal in those exciting views,\nand does not recognise dark lanterns.\"\n\n\"No sir, we are much soberer like; but still there remains the Seven\nVials.\"\n\nThe Parson was up to snuff--if the matter may be put upon so low a\nfooting. Mrs. Muggridge had placed her arms akimbo, in challenge\nTheological. He knew that her views were still the lowest of the low,\nand could not be hoisted by any petard to the High Church level. And\nthe worst of it is that such people are pat with awkward points of Holy\nWrit, as hard to parry as the stroke of Jarnac. In truth he must himself\nconfess that partly thus had Thyatira, at an early and impressible age,\nbeen induced to join the Church, when there chanced to be a vacancy for\na housemaid at the Parsonage. It was in his father's parish, where her\nfather, Stephen Muggridge, occupied a farm belonging to the Rev. Isaac\nPenniloe. Philip, as a zealous Churchman, urged that the Parson's chief\ntenant should come to church, but the Rev. Isaac took a larger view,\npreferring his tangible cornland to his spiritual Vineyard.\n\n\"You had better let Stephen alone,\" he said, \"you would very soon get\nthe worst of it, with all your new Oxford theology. Farmer Steve is a\nwonderfully stout Antip\u00c3\u00a6dobaptist; and he searches the Scriptures every\nday, which leaves no chance for a Churchman, who can only find time on a\nSaturday.\"\n\nThis dissuasion only whetted the controversial appetite, and off set\nPhilip with his Polyglot Bible under his arm. When Farmer Stephen saw\nhim coming, he smiled a grim and gallant smile, being equally hot for\nthe combat. Says he, after a few preliminary passes,\n\n\"Now, young sir, look here! I'll show 'e a text as you can't explain\naway, with all Oxford College at the back of thee. Just you turn to\nGospel of John, third chapter and fifth verse, and you read it, after\nme. 'Except a man be born of water and of the spirit, he cannot enter\ninto the Kingdom of God.' The same in your copy, bain't it now? Then\naccording to my larning, m. a. n. spells _man_, and b. a. b. e. spells\n_babe_. Now till you can put b. a. b. e. in the place of m. a. n. in\nthat there text, what becomes of your Church baptism?\"\n\nThe farmer grinned gently at the Parson, in the pride of triumph, and\nlooked round for his family to share it.\n\n\"Farmer Stephen, that sounds well;\" replied the undaunted Philip, \"but\nperhaps you will oblige me, by turning over a few leaves, as far as the\nsixteenth chapter of the same Gospel, and verse twenty-one. You see how\nit begins with reference to the pains of a mother, and then occur these\nwords--'she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a _man_ is\nborn into the world.' Now was that man born full-grown, Farmer Stephen?\"\n\nThe farmer knitted his brows, and stared; there was no smile left upon\nhis face; but in lieu of it came a merry laugh from beside his big oaken\nchair; and the head of her class in the village school was studying his\ncountenance.\n\n\"Her can go to Parsonage,\" quoth the Antip\u00c3\u00a6dobaptist, \"her won't take no\nharm in a household where they know their Bible so.\"\n\nFarmer Stephen was living still; and like a gentleman had foregone all\nattempts to re-capture his daughter. With equal forbearance, Penniloe\nnever pressed his own opinions concerning smaller matters upon his pious\nhousekeeper, and therefore was fain to decline, as above, her often\nproffered challenges.\n\n\"There are many things still very dark before us,\" he answered with his\nsweet sad smile; \"let us therefore be instant in prayer, while not\nneglecting our worldly duties. It is a worldly duty now, which takes me\nfrom my parish, much against my own desires. I shall not stay an hour\nmore than can be helped, and shall take occasion to forward, if I can,\nthe interests of our restoration fund.\"\n\nMrs. Muggridge, when she heard of that, was ready at once to do her\nbest. Not that she cared much about the church repairs, but that her\nfaithful heart was troubled by her master's heavy anxieties. As happens\n(without any one established exception) in such cases, the outlay had\nproved to be vastly vaster than the most exhaustive estimate. Mr.\nPenniloe felt himself liable for the repayment of every farthing; and\nthough the contractors at Exeter were most lenient and considerate\n(being happily a firm of substance), his mind was much tormented--at the\nlower tides of faith--about it. At least twelve hundred pounds was\ncertain to fall due at Christmas, that season of peace and good-will for\nall Christians, who can pay for it. Even at that date there were several\ngood and useful Corporations, Societies, Associations, ready to help the\nChurch of England, even among white men, when the case was put well\nbefore them. The Parson had applied by letter vainly; now he hoped to\nsee the people, and get a trifle out of them.\n\nThe long and expensive journey, and the further expense of the sojourn,\nwere quite beyond his resources--drained so low by the House of the\nLord--but now the solicitors to the estate of Sir Thomas Waldron Bart.\ndeceased required his presence in London for essential formalities, and\ngladly provided the _viaticum_. Therefore he donned his warmest clothes,\nfor the weather was becoming wintry, put the oilskin over his Sunday\nhat--a genuine beaver, which had been his father's, and started in life\nat two guineas, and even now in its Curate stage might stand out for\ntwenty-one shillings--and committing his household solemnly to the care\nof the Almighty, met the first up-coach before daylight on Monday, when\nit changed horses at the _Blue Ball_ Inn, at the north-east corner of\nhis parish.\n\nAll western coaches had been quickened lately by tidings of steam in the\nNorth, which would take a man nearly a score of miles in one hour; and\nthough nobody really believed in this, the mere talk of it made the\nhorses go. There was one coach already, known by the rather profane name\nof _Quicksilver_, which was said to travel at the almost impious pace of\ntwelve miles an hour. But few had much faith in this break-neck tale,\nand the _Quicksilver_ flew upon the southern road, which never comes\nnigh the Perle valley. Even so, there were coaches on this upper road\nwhich averaged nine miles an hour all the way, foregoing for the sake of\nempty speed, breakfast, and dinner, and even supper on the road. By one\nof these called the _Tallyho_, Mr. Penniloe booked his place for London,\nand arrived there in good health but very tired, early on Tuesday\nmorning.\n\nThe curate of Perlycross was not at all of the rustic parson type, such\nas may still be found in many an out-of-the-way parish of Devon. He was\nnot likely to lose himself in the streets of \"Mighty Babylon,\" as London\nwas generally called in those days--and he showed some perception of the\nright thing to do, by putting up at the \"Old Hummums.\" His charges for\nthe week were borne by the lawyers, upon whose business he was come; and\ntherefore the whole of his time was placed at the disposal of their\nagents, Messrs. Spindrift, Honeysweet, and Hoblin, of Theobald's Road,\nGray's Inn. That highly respected firm led him about from office to\noffice, and pillar to post, sometimes sitting upon the pillar, sometimes\nleaning against the post, according to the usage immemorial of their\nlearned Profession. But one of the things he was resolved to do between\nDoe and Roe, and Nokes and Styles, was to see his old friend Harrison\nGowler, concerning the outrage at Perlycross.\n\nThere happened to be a great run now upon that eminent Physician,\nbecause he had told a lady of exalted rank, who had a loose tendon\nsomewhere, that she had stepped on a piece of orange-peel five and\ntwenty years ago. Historical research proved this to be too true,\nalthough it had entirely escaped the august patient's memory. Dr. Gowler\nbecame of course a Baronet at once, his practice was doubled, though it\nhad been very large, and so were all his fees, though they had not been\nsmall. In a word, he was the rage, and was making golden hay in the full\nblaze of a Royal sun.\n\nNo wonder then that the simple friend for a long time sought the great\nman vainly. He could not very well write, to ask for an interview on the\nfollowing day, because he never knew at what hour he might hope to be\ndelivered from the lawyers; and it never occurred to him to prepay the\npostage of his card from door to table, through either of the haughty\nfootmen. Slow as he was to take offence, he began to fear that it must\nbe meant, for the name of his hotel was on his cards; until as he was\nturning away once more, debating with himself whether self-respect would\nallow him to lift that brass knocker again, the great man himself came\npoint-blank upon him. The stately footman had made a rush for his pint\nof half-and-half round the corner, and Sir Harrison had to open his own\ndoor to show a noble patient forth.\n\n\"What, you in London, Penniloe!\" And a kind grasp of the hand made it\nclear, that the physician was not himself to blame. In a few quick words\nit was arranged that the Parson should call again at six o'clock, and\nshare his old friend's simple meal. \"We shall have two good hours for a\ntalk,\" said Gowler, \"for all the great people are at dinner then. At\neight, I have a consultation on.\"\n\n\"I never have what can be called a dinner;\" Sir Harrison said, when\nthey met again; \"only a bit of--I forget what the Greek expression is.\nThere is an American turn for it.\"\n\n\"You must indeed be overdone, if you are forgetting your Greek,\" replied\nhis friend; \"you were far in front of me there always; though I think I\nwas not so far behind, in Latin.\"\n\n\"I think you were better in both. But what matter? We have little time\nnow for such delights. How often I wish I were back again at Oxford; ten\ntimes poorer, but a thousand times happier. What is the good of my\nhundred pounds a day? I often get that; and am ashamed of it.\"\n\nThe Parson refrained from quoting any of the plentiful advice upon that\nmatter, from the very highest authorities. He tried to look cheerfully\nat his old friend, and did not even shake his head. But a very deep\nsadness was in his own heart; and yet a confirmation of his own higher\nfaith.\n\nThen knowing that the time was very short and feeling his duty to his\nown parish, he told the tale he was come to tell; and Sir Harrison\nlistened intently to it.\n\n\"I scarcely know what to think,\" he said; \"even if I were on the spot,\nand knew every one whom it was possible to suspect, it would be a\nterrible puzzle to me. One thing may be said, with confidence, amounting\nalmost to certainty, that it is not a medical matter at all. That much I\ncan settle, beyond all doubt, by means which I need not specify. Even\nwith you I cannot enter upon questions so professional. We know that\nirregular things are done, and the folly of the law compels them. But\nthis is quite out of the course they pursue. However I can make quite\ncertain about all that within a week. Meanwhile you should look for a\nmore likely clue. You have lost invaluable time by concluding, as of\ncourse the stupid public would, especially after all the Burke and Hare\naffairs, that 'the doctors must be at the bottom of it.' Most unlucky\nthat you were so unwell, or you might have set the enquiry on the right\ntrack from the first. Surely it must have occurred to you that medical\nmen, as a general rule, are the sharpest fellows of the neighbourhood,\nexcept of course--of course excepting the parsons?\"\n\n\"They are sharper than we are,\" said the Parson with a smile; \"but\nperhaps that is the very thing that tells against our faith in them.\"\n\n\"Very likely. But still it keeps them from utterly mad atrocities. Sir\nThomas Waldron, a famous man, a grand old soldier, and above all a\nwealthy man! Why they could have done no more to a poor old wretch from\nthe workhouse!\"\n\n\"The crime in that case would have been as great; perhaps greater,\nbecause more cowardly.\"\n\n\"You always were a highflyer, my friend. But never mind the criminality.\nWhat we want to know is the probability. And to find out that, we have\nto study not the laws of morality, but the rules of human conduct. What\nwas the name of the man I met about the case, at your house? Oh, I\nremember--Gronow; a very shrewd clear-headed fellow. Well, what does he\nsay about it?\"\n\n\"As nearly as possible what you have said. Some slight suspicion has\nfallen upon him. But as I told you, Jemmy Fox has come in for the lion's\nshare of it.\"\n\n\"Poor young fellow! It must be very hard to bear. It will make him hate\na Profession in which he would have been sure to distinguish himself,\nbecause he really loves it. What a thick-headed monster the English\npublic is! They always exult in a wild-goose chase. Are you sure that\nthe body was ever carried off at all?\"\n\n\"The very question Doctor Gronow asked! Unhappily, there can be no doubt\nwhatever upon that point. As I ought to have told you, though I was not\nthere to see it, the search was made in the middle of the day, and with\na dozen people round the grave. They went to the bottom, found the\nbrickwork broken down, and no sign of any coffin.\"\n\n\"Well, that ought to lead us to something clear. That alone is almost\ncertain proof of what I said just now. 'Resurrection-men,' as the stupid\npublic calls them--would have taken the body alone. Not only because\nthey escape all charge of felony by doing so, but that it is so much\neasier; and for many other reasons which you may imagine. I begin to see\nmy way more clearly. Depend upon it, this is some family matter. Some\nprivate feud, or some motive of money, or perhaps even some religious\nscruple lies at the bottom of this strange affair. I begin to think\nthat you will have to go to Spain, before you understand it all. How has\nLady Waldron behaved about it?\"\n\n\"She has been most bitter against poor Jemmy.\" Mr. Penniloe had not\nheard of what was happening this very week at Walderscourt. \"She will\nnot see him, will not hear his name, and is bitter against any one who\ntakes his part. She cannot even bring herself to speak to me, because in\ncommon fairness I have done my best for him, against the general\nopinion, and her own firm conclusion. That is one reason why I am in\nLondon now. She will not even act with me in taking probate of the will.\nIn fact it has driven her, as I fear, almost to the verge of insanity;\nfor she behaves most unkindly even to her daughter. But she is more to\nbe pitied than blamed, poor thing.\"\n\n\"I agree with you; in case of all this being genuine. But is it so? Or\nis it a bit of acting over-acted? I have known women, who could act so\nas to impose upon their own brains.\"\n\n\"It has never once entered my head,\" replied the simple-minded Parson,\n\"to doubt that all she says, and does, is genuine. Even you could not\ndoubt, if you beheld her.\"\n\n\"I am not so sure of that,\" observed Sir Harrison very drily; \"the\nbeauty of your character is the grand simplicity. You have not the least\nidea of any wickedness.\"\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" cried the Parson deeply shocked; \"it is, alas, my sad\nduty to find out and strive with the darkest cases of the depravity of\nour fallen race!\"\n\n\"Of course. But you think none the worse of them for that. It is water\non a duck's back, to such a man as you. Well, have it so; if you like. I\nsee the worst of their bodies, and you the worst of their souls, as you\nsuppose. But I think you put some of your own into them--infusion of\nsounder blood, as it were.\"\n\n\"Gowler, you may think as ill, as fallen nature can make you think, of\nall your fellow-creatures;\" Mr. Penniloe spoke with a sharpness very\nseldom found in words of his. \"But in fair truth, it is beyond the\nblackest of all black bitterness to doubt poor Lady Waldron's simple and\nperfect sincerity.\"\n\n\"Because of her very magnificent eyes,\" Sir Harrison answered, as if to\nhimself, and to meet his own too charitable interjections. \"But what has\nshe done, to carry out her wild revenge at an outrage, which she would\nfeel more keenly perhaps than the most sensitive of English women? Has\nshe moved high and low, ransacked the earth, set all the neighbourhood\non fire, and appealed with tears, and threats, and money, (which is the\nstrongest of all appeals) to the C\u00c3\u00a6sar enthroned in London? If she had\ndone any of these things, I fancy I should have heard of them.\"\n\nFor the moment Mr. Penniloe disliked his friend; as a man may feel\nannoyance at his own wife even, when her mind for some trivial cause is\nmoving on a lower level than his own.\n\n\"As yet she has not taken any strong steps,\" he confessed with some\nreluctance; \"because she has been obliged to act under her lawyer's\nguidance. Remember that she is a foreigner, and knows nothing of our\nlegal machinery.\"\n\n\"Very likely not. But Webber does--Webber her solicitor. I suppose\nWebber has been very energetic.\"\n\n\"He has not done so much as one might have expected. In fact he has\nseemed to me rather remiss. He has had his own private hands at work,\nwhich as he says is the surest plan; but he has brought no officers from\nLondon down. He tells me that in all such cases they have failed; and\nmore than that, they have entirely spoiled the success of all private\nenquiry.\"\n\n\"It looks to me very much as if private enquiry had no great desire to\nsucceed. My conclusion grows more and more irresistible. Shall I tell\nyou what it is?\"\n\n\"My dear fellow, by all means do. I shall attach very great importance\nto it.\"\n\n\"It is simply this,\" Sir Harrison spoke less rapidly than usual; \"all\nyour mystery is solved in this--_Lady Waldron knows all about it_. How\nyou all have missed that plain truth, puzzles me. She has excellent\nreasons for restricting the enquiry, and casting suspicion upon poor\nFox. Did I not hear of a brother of hers, a Spanish nobleman I think he\nwas?\"\n\n\"Yes, her twin-brother, the Count de Varcas. She has always been warmly\nattached to him; but Sir Thomas did not like him much. I think he has\nbeen extravagant. Lady Waldron has been doing her utmost to discover\nhim.\"\n\n\"I dare say. To be sure she has! Advertised largely of course. Oh dear,\noh dear! What poor simple creatures we men are, in comparison with\nwomen!\"\n\nMr. Penniloe was silent. He had made a good dinner, and taken a glass of\nold port-wine; and both those proceedings were very rare with him. Like\nall extremely abstemious men, when getting on in years, he found his\nbrain not strengthened, but confused, by the unusual supply. The air of\nLondon had upon him that effect which it often has at first upon\nvisitors from the country--quick increase of appetite, and hearty joy in\nfeeding.\n\n\"Another thing you told me, which confirms my view,\" resumed the\nrelentless Doctor--\"the last thing discovered before you came away--but\nnot discovered, mark you, by her ladyship's agents--was that the cart\nsupposed to have been employed had been traced to a smuggler's\nhiding-place, in a desolate and unfrequented spot, probably in the\ndirection of the coast. Am I right in supposing that?\"\n\n\"Partly so. It would be towards the sea; though certainly not the\nshortest way.\"\n\n\"But the best way probably of getting at the coast, if you wished to\navoid towns and villages? That you admit? Then all is plain. Poor Sir\nThomas was to be exported. Probably to Spain. That I will not pretend to\ndetermine; but I think it most likely. Perhaps to be buried in Catholic\nsoil, and with Catholic ceremonial; which they could not do openly here,\nbecause of his own directions. How simple the very deepest mystery\nbecomes, when once you have the key to it! But how strange that it never\noccurred to you! I should have thought Gronow at any rate would have\nguessed it.\"\n\n\"He has more penetration than I have; I am well aware of that,\" replied\nthe humble Parson; \"and you of course have more than either of us. But\nfor all that, Gowler, and although I admit that your theory is very\nplausible, and explains many points that seemed inexplicable, I cannot,\nand I will not accept it for a moment.\"\n\n\"Where is your difficulty? Is it not simple--consistent with all that\nwe know of such people, priest-ridden of course, and double-faced, and\ncrafty? Does it not solve every difficulty? What can you urge against\nit?\"\n\n\"My firm belief in the honesty, affection, and good faith of women.\"\n\n\"Whew!\" The great physician forgot his dignity, in the enjoyment of so\nfine a joke. He gave a long whistle, and then put his thumb to his nose,\nand extended his fingers, as schoolboys of that period did. \"Honesty of\nwomen, Penniloe! At your age, you surely know better than that. A very\nfrail argument indeed.\"\n\n\"Because of my age it is perhaps that I do know better. I would rather\nnot discuss the subject. You have your views; and I have mine.\"\n\n\"I am pleased with this sort of thing, because it reminds one so much of\nboyhood;\" Sir Harrison stood by the fire, and began to consult his short\ngray locks. \"Let me see, how many years is it, since I cherished such\nillusions? Well, they are pleasant enough while they last. I suppose you\nnever make a bet, Penniloe?\"\n\n\"Of course not, Gowler. You seem to be as ignorant of clergymen, as you\nare of women.\"\n\n\"Don't be touchy, my dear fellow. Many of the cloth accept the odds, and\nhave privilege of clergy when they lose. Well, I'll tell you what I will\ndo. You see that little cupboard in the panelling? It has only one key,\nand the lock is peculiar. Here I deposit--behold my act and deed--these\ntwo fifty-pound notes. You take the key. Now you shall come, or send\neither churchwarden, and carry them off for the good of your\nchurch-restoration fund, the moment you can prove that my theory is\nwrong.\"\n\n\"I am not sure,\" said the clergyman, with a little agitation, as the\ncourage of that single glass of port declined, \"that this is not too\nmuch in the nature of a wager.\"\n\n\"No, there is no wager. That requires two parties. It is simply a\nquestion of forfeiture. No peril to a good cause--as you would call\nit--in case of failure. And a solid gain to it, if I prove wrong. Take\nthe key, my friend. My time is up.\"\n\nMr. Penniloe, the most conscientious of mankind, and therefore the most\ngentle, had still some qualms about the innocence of this. But his\nfriend's presumptuous manner hushed them. He dropped the key into his\ndeep watch-pocket, specially secured against the many rogues of London;\nand there it was when he mounted on the _Magnet_ coach, at two o'clock\non the Friday afternoon, prepared for a long and dreary journey to his\nhome.\n\nThe _Magnet_ was one of those calm and considerate coaches which thought\na great deal more of the comfort and safety of their passengers and\nhorses, than of the fidgety hands of any clock--be it even a cathedral\nclock--on the whole road from London to Exeter. What are the most\nimportant hours of the day? Manifestly those of feeding. Each of them is\nworth any other three. Therefore, you lose three times the time you\nsave, by omitting your dinner. This coach breakfasted, dined, and\nsupped, and slept on the road, or rather out of it, and started again as\nfresh as paint, quite early enough in the morning.\n\nWith his usual faith in human nature, Mr. Penniloe had not enquired into\nthese points, but concluded that this coach would rush along in the\nbreathless manner of the _Tallyho_. This leisurely course began to make\nhim very nervous, and when on the Saturday at two o'clock, another\ndeliberate halt was made at a little wayside inn, some fifty miles still\nfrom Perlycross, and every one descended with a sprightly air, the\nclergyman marched up to the coachman to remonstrate.\n\n\"Unless we get on a little faster,\" he said, with a kind but anxious\nsmile; \"I shall not be at home for Sunday.\"\n\n\"Can't help that, sir. The coach must dine;\" replied the fat driver, as\nhe pulled his muffler down, to give his capacious mouth fair play.\n\n\"But--but consider, Mr. Coachman; I must get home. I have my church to\nserve.\"\n\n\"Must serve the dinner first, sir, if you please,\" said the landlord\ncoming forward with a napkin, which he waved as if it were worth a score\nof sermons: \"all the gents are waiting, sir, for you to say the\ngrace--hot soup, knuckle of veal, boiled round, and baked potatoes.\nGents has to pay, if they dine, or if they don't. Knowing this, all\ngents does dine. Preach all the better, sir, to-morrow for it.\"\n\nIf this preparation were needful, the curate's sermon would not have\nbeen excellent, for anxiety had spoiled his appetite. When at length\nthey lumbered on again, he strove to divert his thoughts by observing\nhis fellow-passengers. And now for the first time he descried, over the\nluggage piled on the roof, a man with a broad slouched hat and fur\ncloak, who sat with his back towards him, for Mr. Penniloe had taken his\nplace on the hinder part of the coach. That man had not joined the\ndinner party, yet no one remained on the coach or in it during the\ndinner hour; for the weather was cold and windy, with a few flakes of\nsnow flying idly all day, and just making little ribs of white upon the\nroad. Mr. Penniloe was not a very observant man, least of all on a\nSaturday, when his mind was dwelling chiefly upon Scriptural subjects;\nbut he could not help wondering how this man came there; for the coach\nhad not stopped since they left the little inn.\n\nThis perhaps drew his attention to the man, who appeared to be\n\"thoroughly a foreigner,\" as John Bull in those days expressed it. For\nhe wore no whiskers, but a long black beard streaked with silver, as\neven those behind could see, for the whirl of the north wind tossed it\nnow and then upon his left shoulder. He kept his head low behind the\ncoachman's broad figure, and appeared to speak to nobody, but smoked\ncigars incessantly, lighting each from the stump of its predecessor, and\nscattering much ash about, to the discomfort of his neighbours' eyes.\nAlthough Mr. Penniloe never smoked, he enjoyed the fragrance of a good\ncigar, perhaps more than the puffer himself does (especially if he puff\ntoo vehemently), and he was able to pronounce this man's tobacco very\nfine.\n\nAt length they arrived at Pumpington, about six miles from Perlycross,\nand here Mr. Penniloe fully expected another halt for supper, and had\nmade up his mind in that case to leave the coach and trudge home afoot.\nBut to his relief, they merely changed horses, and did that with some\nshow of alacrity; for they were bound to be at Exeter that night, and\nthe snow was beginning to thicken. At the turnpike-gate two men got up;\none of them a sailor, going probably to Plymouth, who mounted the\ntarpaulin that covered the luggage, and threw himself flat upon it with\na jovial air, and made himself quite at home, smoking a short pipe, and\nwaving a black bottle, when he could spare time from sucking it. The\nother man came and sat beside the Parson, who did not recognise him at\nfirst; for the coach carried only two lamps, both in front, and their\nlight was thrown over their shoulders now and then, in rough streams,\nlike the beard of the foreigner. All the best coaches still carried a\nguard, and the Royal Mail was bound to do so; but the Magnet towards the\nend of its career had none.\n\nMr. Penniloe meekly allowed the new-comer to edge his feet gradually out\nof the straw nest, and work his own into the heart of it; for now it was\ntruly a shivering and a shuddering night. The steam of the horses and\ntheir breath came back in turbid clouds, and the snow, or soft hail (now\nknown as _graupel_), cut white streaks through them into travellers'\neyes, and danced on the roof like lozenges. Nobody opened mouth, except\nthe sailor; and his was stopped, as well as opened, by the admirable fit\nof the neck of his rum-bottle. But this being over-strained became too\nsoon a hollow consolation; and the rim of the glass rattled drily\nagainst his chattering teeth, till he cast it away.\n\n\"Never say die, mates. I'll sing you a song. Don Darkimbo, give us a\ncigar to chaw. Never could smoke them things, gentlemen and ladies.\nCan't 'e speak, or won't 'e then? Never mind, here goes!\"\n\nTo his own encouragement this jolly fellow, with his neck and chest\nthrown open, and his summer duds on, began to pour forth a rough\nnautical ballad, not only beyond the pale of the most generous\northodoxy, but entirely out of harmony with the tone of all good\nsociety. In plainer words, as stupid a bit of ribaldry and blasphemy as\nthe most advanced period could produce.\n\nThen up rose Mr. Penniloe, and in a firm voice clear above the piping of\nthe wind, and the roar of wheels, and rattle of loose harness,\nadministered to that mariner a rebuke so grave, and solemn, and yet so\nfull of large kindness and of allowance for his want of teaching, that\nthe poor fellow hung his head, and felt a rising in his throat, and\nbeing not advanced beyond the tender stage of intoxication, passed into\na liquid state of terror and repentance.\n\nWith this the clergyman was content, being of longer experience than to\nindulge in further homily. But the moment he sat down, up rose the\ngentleman who had cribbed his straw, and addressed the applauding\npassengers.\n\n\"My friends, the Reverend Penniloe has spoken well and eloquently. But I\nthink you will agree with me, that it would be more consistent of him,\nand more for the service of the Lord, if he kept his powers of reproof\nfor the use of his own parishioners. He is the clergyman of Perlycross,\na place notorious throughout the country for the most infamous of\ncrimes--a place where even the dead are not allowed to sleep in peace.\"\n\nAfter this settler, the man sat down, and turned his back on the Parson,\nwho had now recognised him, with deep sorrow at his low malevolence. For\nthis was no other than Solomon Pack, watchmaker and jeweller at\nPumpington, well known among his intimates as \"Pack of lies,\" from his\naffection for malignant gossip. Mr. Penniloe had offended him by\nemploying the rival tradesman, Pack's own brother-in-law, with whom he\nwas at bitter enmity.\n\n\"Mr. Pack, you have done much harm, I fear; and this is very unjust of\nyou\"--was all that the Parson deigned to say. But he had observed with\nsome surprise, that while Pack was speaking, the foreigner turned round\nand gazed intently, without showing much of his swarthy face, at\nhimself--Philip Penniloe.\n\nBefore silence was broken again, the _Magnet_ drew up at the _Blue Ball_\nInn, where the lane turns off towards Perlycross, and the clergyman\nleaving his valise with the landlord, started upon his three-mile\ntrudge. But before he had walked more than a hundred yards he was\nsurprised to see, across the angle of the common, that the coach had\nstopped again at the top of a slight rise, where a footpath led from the\nturnpike road towards the northern entrance to Walderscourt. The clouds\nwere now dispersing, and the full moon shining brightly, and the ground\nbeing covered with newly fallen snow, the light was as good as it is\nupon many a winter afternoon. Mr. Penniloe was wearing a pair of\nlong-sight glasses, specially adapted to his use by a skilful optician\nin London, and he was as proud of them as a child is of his first\nwhistle. Without them the coach might have been a haystack, or a whale,\nso far as he could tell; with them he could see the horses, and the\npassengers, and the luggage.\n\nHaving seen too much of that coach already, he was watching it merely as\na test for his new glasses; and the trial proved most satisfactory. \"How\nproud Fay will be,\" he was thinking to himself, \"when I tell her that I\ncan see the big pear-tree from the window, and even the thrushes on the\nlawn!\" But suddenly his interest in the sight increased. The man, who\nwas standing in the road with his figure shown clearly against a snowy\nbank, was no other than that dark foreigner, who had stared at him so\nintently. There was the slouched hat, and there was the fur cloak, and\neven the peculiar bend of the neck. A parcel was thrown to him from the\nroof, and away he went across the common, quite as if he knew the way,\nthrough furze and heather, to the back entrance of Walderscourt grounds.\nHe could not see the Parson in the darker lane below, and doubtless\nbelieved himself unseen.\n\nThe circumstance aroused some strange ideas in the candid mind of\nPenniloe. That man knowing who he was from Pack's tirade, must have been\ndesirous to avoid him, otherwise he would have quitted the coach at the\n_Blue Ball_, and taken this better way to Walderscourt; for the lane Mr.\nPenniloe was following led more directly thither by another entrance.\nWhat if there were something, after all, in Gowler's too plausible\ntheory? That man looked like a Spaniard, probably a messenger from Lady\nWaldron's scapegrace brother; for that was his character if plain truth\nwere spoken, without any family gloss upon it. And if he were a\nmessenger, why should he come thus, unless there were something they\nwanted to conceal?\n\nThe Curate had not traversed all this maze of meditations, which made\nhim feel very miserable--for of all things he hated suspiciousness, and\nthat \u00c2\u00a3100, though needed so sadly, would be obtained at too high a cost,\nif the cost were his faith in womankind--when, lo, his own church-tower\nrose grandly before him, its buttresses and stringing courses capped\nwith sparkling snow, and the yew-tree by the battlements feathered with\nthe same, and away to the east the ivy mantle of the Abbey, laced and\nbespangled with the like caprice of beauty, showered from the\nglittering stores of heaven.\n\nHe put on a spurt through the twinkling air, and the frozen snow crushed\nbeneath his rapid feet; and presently he had shaken hands with\nMuggridge, and Fay in her nightgown made a reckless leap from the height\nof ten stairs into his gladsome arms.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\nA SERMON IN STONE.\n\n\nNow Sergeant Jakes was not allowed to chastise any boys on Sunday. This\nmade the day hang very heavy on his hands; and as misfortunes never come\nsingle, the sacred day robbed him of another fine resource. For Mr.\nPenniloe would not permit even Muggridge, the pious, the sage, and the\nprim, to receive any visitors--superciliously called by the front-door\npeople \"followers\"--upon that blessed day of rest, when surely the\nsweeter side of human nature is fostered and inspirited, from\nreading-desk and lectern, from gallery and from pulpit.\n\nHowever even clergymen are inconsistent, as their own wives acknowledge\nconfidentially; and Mr. Penniloe's lectures upon Solomon's Song--a\ntreatise then greatly admired, as a noble allegory, by High\nChurchmen--were not enforced at home by any warmth of practice. Thus\nstood the law; and of all offences upon the Sergeant's Hecatologue,\nmutiny was the most heinous; therefore he could not mutiny.\n\nBut surely if Mr. Penniloe could have received, or conceived, a germ of\nthe faintest suspicion concerning this faithful soldier's alternatives\non the afternoon of the Sabbath--as Churchmen still entitled it--he\nwould have thrown open every door of kitchen, back-kitchen, scullery,\nand even pantry to him, that his foot might be kept from so offending.\nAy, and more than his foot, his breast, and arm--the only arm he had,\nand therefore leaving no other blameless.\n\nIt is most depressing to record the lapse of such a lofty character, so\ngallant, faithful, self-denying, true, austere, and simple--though some\nof these merits may be refused him, when the truth comes out--as, alas,\nit must. All that can be pleaded in his favour, is that ancient,\nthreadbare, paltry, and (as must even be acknowledged) dastardly\npalliation--the woman tempted him, and he fell! Fell from his brisk and\njaunty mien, his noble indifference to the fair, and severity to their\nlittle ones, his power of example to the rising age, and his pure-minded\nloyalty to Thyatira, watered by rivers of tea, and fed by acres of bread\nand butter. And the worst of it was, that he had sternly resolved, with\nhaughty sense of right and hearty scorn of a previous slip towards\nbacksliding, that none of this weakness should ever, even in a vision,\ncome anigh him any more. Yet see, how easily this rigid man was wound\nround the finger of a female \"teener\"--as the Americans beautifully\nexpress it!\n\nHe was sitting very sadly at his big black desk, one mild and melancholy\nSabbath eve, with the light of the dull day fading out, and failing to\nmake facets from the diamonds of the windows, and the heavy school-clock\nticking feebly, as if it wished time was over: while shadows, that would\nhave frightened any other unmarried man in the parish, came in from the\nsilent population of the old churchyard, as if it were the haze of\nanother world. A little cloud of smoke, to serve them up with their own\nsauce, would have consoled the school-master; but he never allowed any\nsmoking in this temple of the Muses, and as the light waned he lit his\ntallow candle, to finish the work that he had in hand.\n\nThis was a work of the highest criticism, to revise, correct, and\narrange in order of literary merit all the summaries of the morning\nsermon prepared by the head-class in the school. Some of these\ncompositions were of extreme obscurity, and some conveyed very strange\ndoctrinal views. He was inclined to award the palm to the following fine\nepitome, practical, terse, and unimpeachably orthodox--\"The Sermon was,\nsir, that all men ort to be good, and never to do no wikked things\nwhennever they can help it.\" But while he yet paused, with long quill in\nhand, the heavy oak door from the inner yard was opened very gently, and\na slender form attired in black appeared at the end of the long and\ngloomy room.\n\nFirm of nerve as he was, the master quailed a little at this unexpected\nsight; and therefore it became a very sweet relief, when the vision\nbrightened into a living and a friendly damsel, and more than that a\nvery charming one. All firm resolutions like shadows vanished; instead\nof a stern and distant air and a very rigid attitude, a smile of delight\nand a bow of admiration betrayed the condition of his bosom.\n\nThat fair and artless Tamar knew exactly how to place herself to the\nvery best advantage. She stood on the further side of the candle, so\nthat its low uncertain light hovered on the soft curve of her cheeks,\nand came back in a flow of steady lustre from her large brown eyes. She\nblushed an unbidden tear away, and timidly allowed those eyes to rest\nupon the man of learning. No longer was she the gay coquette, coying\nwith frolic challenge, but the gentle, pensive, submissive maiden,\nappealing to a loftier mind. The Sergeant's tender heart was touched, up\nsprang his inborn chivalry; and he swept away with his strong right hand\nthe efforts of juvenile piety, and the lessons of Holy Writ.\n\n\"Sergeant Schoolmaster, no chair for me;\" Tamar began in a humble voice,\nas he offered his own official seat. \"I have but a moment to spare, and\nI fear you will be so angry with me, for intruding upon you like this.\nBut I am so--oh so unhappy!\"\n\n\"What is it, my dear? Who has dared to vex you? Tell me his name, and\nalthough it is Sunday--ah just let me come across him!\"\n\n\"Nobody, nobody, Sergeant Schoolmaster;\" here she pulled out a\nhandkerchief, which a woman would have pronounced, at a glance, the\nproperty of her mistress. \"Oh how shall I dare to tell you who it is?\"\n\n\"I insist upon knowing,\" said the Sergeant boldly, taking the upper\nhand, because the maiden looked so humble; \"I insist upon knowing who it\nis, this very moment.\"\n\n\"Then if I must tell, if you won't let me off,\" she answered with a\nsweet glance, and a sweeter smile; \"it is nobody else but Sergeant Jakes\nhimself.\"\n\n\"Me!\" exclaimed the veteran; \"whatever have I done? You know that I\nwould be the last in the world to vex you.\"\n\n\"Oh it is because you are so fierce. And that of course is, because you\nare so brave.\"\n\n\"But my dear, my pretty dear, how could I ever be fierce to you?\"\n\n\"Yes, you are going to cane my brother Billy, in the morning.\"\n\nThis was true beyond all cavil--deeply and beautifully true. The\nSergeant stared, and frowned a little. Justice must allow no dalliance.\n\n\"And oh, he has got such chilblains, sir! Two of them broke only\nyesterday, and will be at their worst in the morning. And he didn't mean\nit, sir, oh he never meant it, when he called you an 'Old beast'!\"\n\n\"The discipline of the school must be maintained.\" Mr. Jakes stroked his\nbeard, which was one of the only pair then grown in the parish, (the\nother being Dr. Gronow's) for the growth of a beard in those days argued\na radical and cantankerous spirit, unless it were that of a military\nman. Without his beard Mr. Jakes would not have inspired half the\nneedful awe; and he stroked it now with dignity, though the heart\nbeneath it was inditing of an _infra dig._ idea. \"Unhappily he did it,\nMiss, in the presence of the other boys. It cannot be looked over.\"\n\n\"Oh what can I do, Sergeant? What can I do? I'll do anything you tell\nme, if you'll only let him off.\"\n\nThe Schoolmaster gave a glance at all the windows. They were well above\nthe level of the ground outside. No one could peep in, without standing\non a barrel, or getting another boy to give him a leg up.\n\n\"Tamar, do you mean what you say?\" he enquired, with a glance of mingled\ntenderness and ferocity--the tenderness for her, the ferocity for her\nbrother.\n\n\"If you have any doubt, you have only got to try me. There can't be any\nharm in that much, can there?\" She looked at him, with a sly twinkle in\nher eyes, as much as to say--\"Well now, come, don't be so bashful.\"\n\nUpon that temptation, this long-tried veteran fell from his loyalty and\nhigh position. He approached to the too fascinating damsel, took her\npretty hand, and whispered something through her lovely curls. Alas, the\nfinal word of his conditions of abject surrender was one which rhymed\nwith \"this,\" or \"Miss,\" or--that which it should have been requited\nwith--a hiss. Oh Muggridge, Muggridge, where were you? Just stirring a\ncup of unbefriended tea, and meditating on this man's integrity!\n\n\"Oh you are too bad, too bad, Sergeant!\" exclaimed the young girl\nstarting back, with both hands lifted, and a most becoming blush. \"I\nnever did--I never could have thought that you had any mind for such\ntrifles. Why, what would all the people say, if I were only to mention\nit?\"\n\n\"Nobody would believe you;\" replied Mr. Jakes, to quench that idea,\nwhile he trembled at it; adding thereby to his iniquities.\n\n\"Well perhaps they wouldn't. No I don't believe they would. But\neverybody likes a bit of fun sometimes. But we won't say another word\nabout it.\"\n\n\"Won't we though? I have got a new cane, Tamar--the finest I ever yet\nhandled for spring. The rarest thing to go round chilblains. Bargain, or\nno bargain, now?\"\n\n\"Bargain!\" she cried; \"but I couldn't do it now. It must be in a more\nquieter place. Besides you might cheat me, and cane him after all. Oh it\nis too bad, too bad to think of. Perhaps I might try, next Sunday.\"\n\n\"But where shall I see you next Sunday, my dear? 'Never put off; it\ngives time for to scoff.' Give me one now, and I'll stick to it.\"\n\n\"No, Sergeant Jakes. I don't like to tell you, and my father would be so\nangry. But I don't see what right he has to put me in there. And oh, it\nis so lonely! And I am looking out for ghosts, and never have a happy\nmouthful. That old woman will have something to answer for. But it's no\ngood to ask me, Sergeant; because--because ever so many would be after\nme, if they only got a hint of it.\"\n\nThis of course was meant to stop him; but somehow it had quite the\nopposite effect; and at last he got out of the innocent girl the whole\ntale of her Sunday seclusion. The very best handmaid--as everybody\nknows--will go through the longest and bitterest bout of soaking,\nshivering, freezing, starving, dragging under wheels, and being blown up\nto the sky, rather than forego her \"Sunday out.\" Miss Tamar Haddon was\nentitled always to this Sabbath travail; and such was her courage that\nhave it she would, though it blew great guns, and rained cats and dogs.\n\nNow, her father, as may have been said before, was Walter Haddon of the\n_Ivy-bush_, as respectable a man as ever lived, and very fond of his\nchildren. This made him anxious for their welfare; and welfare meaning\neven then--though not so much as now it does--fair wealth, and farewell\npoverty, Mr. Haddon did his best to please his wealthy aunt, a childless\nwidow who lived at Perlycombe. For this old lady had promised to leave\nher money among his children, if they should fail to offend her. In that\nmatter it was a hundredfold easier to succeed, than it was to fail; for\nher temper was diabolical. Poor Tamar, being of flippant tongue, had\nalready succeeded fatally; and the first question Mrs. Pods always\nasked, before she got out of her pony-carriage, was worded thus--\"Is\nthat minx Tamar in the house?\"\n\nWhatever the weather might be, this lady always drove up with her lame\npony to the door of the _Ivy-bush_, at half-past one of a Sunday,\nexpecting to find a good hot dinner, and hot rum and water afterwards.\nFor all this refreshment she never paid a penny, but presented the\nchildren with promises of the fine things they might look forward to.\nAnd thus, like too many other rich people, she kept all her capital to\nherself, and contrived to get posthumous interest upon it, on the faith\nof contingent remainders.\n\nNow Tamar's mother was dead; and her father knowing well that all the\nyoung sparks of the village were but as the spoils of her bows and\nbonnets, had contrived a very clever plan for keeping her clear of that\nbitter Mrs. Pods, without casting her into the way of yokel youths, and\nspry young bachelors of low degree. At the back of his hostelry stood\nthe old Abbey, covered with great festoons of ivy, from which the Inn\nprobably took its name; and the only entrance to the ruins was by the\narched gateway at the end of his yard, other approaches having been\nwalled up; and the key of the tall iron gate was kept at this Inn for\nthe benefit of visitors.\n\nThe walls of the ancient building could scarcely be seen anywhere for\nthe ivy; and the cloisters and roofless rooms inside were overgrown with\ngrass and briars. But one large chamber, at the end of a passage, still\nretained its vaulted ceiling, and stone pavement scarred with age.\nPerhaps it had been the refectory, for at one side was a deep fireplace,\nwhere many a hearty log had roared; at present its chief business was\nto refresh Miss Tamar Haddon. A few sticks kindled in the old fireplace,\nand a bench from the kitchen of the Inn, made it a tolerable\nkeeping-room, at least in the hours of daylight; though at night the\nbold Sergeant himself might have lacked the courage for sound slumber\nthere.\n\nTo this place was the fair Tamar banished, for the sake of the moneybags\nof Mrs. Pods, from half-past one till three o'clock, on her Sunday\nvisits to the _Ivy-bush_. Hither the fair maid brought her dinner,\nsteaming in a basin hot, and her father's account-book of rough\njottings, which it was her business to verify and interpret; for, as is\nthe duty of each newer generation, she had attained to higher standard\nof ennobling scholarship.\n\nIn a few words now she gave the loving Sergeant a sketch of this\ntime-serving policy, and her exile from the paternal dinner-table, which\naroused his gallant wrath; and then she told him how she had discovered\nentrance unknown to her father, at a spot where a thicket of sycamores,\nat the back of the ruins, concealed a loop-hole not very difficult to\nscale. She could make her escape by that way, if she chose, after her\nfather had locked her in, if it were not for spoiling her Sunday frock.\nAnd if her father went on so, for the sake of pleasing that ugly old\nfrump, she was blest if she would not try that plan, and sit on the\nriver bank far below, as soon as the Spring dried up the rubbish. But if\nthe Sergeant thought it worth his while, to come and afford her a little\ngood advice, perhaps he might discover her Sunday hat waving among the\nivy.\n\nThis enamoured veteran accepted tryst, with a stout heart, but frail\nconscience. The latter would haply have prevailed, if only the wind had\nthe gift of carrying words which the human being does not utter, but\nthinks and forms internally. For the sly maid to herself said this,\nwhile she hastened to call her big brother Watty, to see her safe back\nto Walderscourt.\n\n\"What a poor old noodle! As if I cared twopence, how much he whacks\nBilly! Does he think I would ever let him come anigh me, if it wasn't to\nturn him inside out? Now if it were Low Jarks, his young brother, that\nwould be quite another pair of shoes.\"\n\nOn the following Sunday it was remarked, by even the less observant\nboys, that their venerated Master was not wearing his usual pair of\nblack Sunday breeches, with purple worsted stockings showing a wiry and\nmuscular pair of legs. Strange to say, instead of those, he had his\nsecond best small-clothes on, with dark brown gaiters to the knee, and a\npair of thick laced shoes, instead of Sunday pumps with silk rosettes.\nSo wholly unversed in craft, as yet, was this good hero of a hundred\nfights. Thyatira also marked this change, with some alarm and wonder;\nbut little dreamed she in her simple faith of any rival Delilah.\n\nMr. Penniloe's sermon, that Sunday morning, was of a deeply moving kind.\nHe felt that much was expected of him, after his visit to London; where\nhe must have seen the King and Queen, and they might even have set eyes\non him. He put his long-sight glasses on, so that he could see anybody\nthat required preaching at; and although he was never a cushion-thumper,\nhe smote home to many a too comfortable bosom. Then he gave them the\nsoft end of the rod to suck, as a conscientious preacher always does,\nafter smiting hip and thigh, with a weapon too indigenous. In a word, it\nwas an admirable sermon, and one even more to be loved than admired,\ninasmuch as it tended to spread good-will among men, as a river that has\nits source in heaven.\n\nSergeant Jakes, with his stiff stock on, might be preached at for ever,\nwithout fetching a blink. He sat bolt upright, and every now and then\nflapped the stump of his left arm against his sound heart, not with any\neagerness to drive the lesson home, but in proof of cordial approbation\nof hits, that must tell upon his dear friends round about. One cut\nespecially was meant for Farmer John; and he was angry with that\nthick-skinned man, for staring at another man, as if it were for him.\nAnd then there was a passage, that was certain to come home to his own\nbrother Robert, who began to slaughter largely, and was taking quite\nmoney enough to be of interest to the pulpit. But everybody present\nseemed to Jakes to be applying everything to everybody else--a\ndisinterested process of the noblest turn of thought.\n\nHowever those who have much faith--and who can fail to have some?--in\nthe exhortations of good men who practise their own preaching, would\nhave been confirmed in their belief by this man's later conduct.\nAlthough the body of the church had been reopened for some weeks now,\nwith the tower-arch finished and the south wall rebuilt, yet there were\nmany parts still incomplete, especially the chancel where the fine\nstone screen was being erected as a reredos; and this still remained in\nthe builder's hands, with a canvas partition hiding it.\n\nWhen the congregation had dispersed, Mr. Jakes slipped in behind that\npartition, and stood by a piece of sculpture which he always had\nadmired. In a recess of the northern wall, was a kneeling figure in pure\nwhite marble of a beautiful maiden claimed by death on the very eve of\nher wedding-day. She slept in the Waldron vaults below; while here the\ncalm sweet face, portrayed in substance more durable than ours, spoke\nthrough everlasting silence of tenderness, purity, and the more exalted\nlove.\n\nThe Sergeant stood with his hard eyes fixed upon that tranquil\ncountenance. It had struck him more than once that Tamar's face was\nsomething like it; and he had come to see whether that were so. He found\nthat he had been partly right, but in more important matters wrong. In\nprofile, general outline, and the rounding of the cheeks, there was a\nmanifest resemblance. But in the expression and quality of the faces,\nwhat a difference! Here all was pure, refined and noble, gentle, placid,\nspiritual. There all was tempting, flashing, tricksome, shallow,\nearthly, sensuous.\n\nHe did not think those evil things, for he was not a physiognomist; but\nstill he felt the good ones; and his mind being in the better\ntone--through commune with the preacher's face, which does more than the\nwords sometimes, when all the heart is in it--the wonted look of\nfirmness, and of defiance of the Devil, returned to his own shrewd\ncountenance. The gables of his eyebrows, which had expanded and grown\nshaky, came back to their proper span and set; he nodded sternly, as if\nin pursuit of himself with a weapon of chastisement; and his mouth\nclosed as hard as a wrench-hammer does, with the last turn of the screw\nupon it. Then he sneered at himself, and sighed as he passed the empty\ngrave of his Colonel--what would that grand old warrior have thought of\nthis desertion to the enemy?\n\nBut ashamed as he was of his weak surrender and treachery to his\ncolours, his pride and plighted word compelled him to complete his\nenterprise. The Abbey stood near the churchyard wall, but on that side\nthere was no entrance; and to get at the opposite face of the buildings,\na roundabout way must be taken; and Jakes resolved now that he would\nnot skulk by the lower path from the corner, but walk boldly across the\nmeadow from the lane that led to Perlycombe. This was a back way with no\nhouse upon it, and according to every one's belief here must have lurked\nthat horse and cart, on the night of that awful outrage.\n\nEven to a one-handed man there was no great difficulty in entering one\nof the desolate courts, by the loophole from the thicket; and there he\nmet the fair recluse in a manner rather disappointing to her. Not that\nshe cared at all to pursue her light flirtation with him, but that her\nvanity was shocked, when he failed to demand his sweet reward. And he\ncalled her \"Miss Haddon,\" and treated her with a respect she did not\nappreciate. But she led him to her lonely bower, and roused up the fire\nfor him, for the weather was becoming more severe, and she rallied him\non his clemency, which had almost amounted to weakness, ever since he\nallowed her brother Billy to escape.\n\n\"Fair is fair, Miss;\" the Master answered pensively. \"As soon as you\nbegin to let one off, you are bound to miss the rest of them.\"\n\n\"Who have they got to thank for that? I am afraid they will never know,\"\nshe said with one of her most bewitching smiles, as she came and sat\nbeside him. \"Poor little chaps! How can I thank you for giving them such\na nice time, Sergeant?\"\n\nThe veteran wavered for a moment, as that comely face came nigh, and the\nglossy hair she had contrived to loosen fell almost on his shoulders.\nShe had dressed herself in a killing manner, while a lover's knot of\nmauve-coloured ribbon relieved the dulness of her frock, and enhanced\nthe whiteness of her slender neck. But for all that, the Sergeant was\nnot to be killed, and his mind was prepared for the crisis. He glanced\naround first, not for fear of anybody, but as if he desired witnesses;\nand then he arose from the bench, and looked at this seductive maiden,\nwith eyes that had a steady sparkle, hard to be discomfited by any storm\nof flashes.\n\n\"Tamar,\" he said, \"let us come to the point. I have been a fool; and you\nknow it. You are very young; but somehow you know it. Now have you\nmeant, from first to last, that you would ever think of marrying me?\"\n\nIt never should have been put like that. Why you must never say a word,\nnor use your eyes except for reading, nor even look in your\nlooking-glass, if things are taken in that way.\n\n\"Oh Sergeant, how you frighten me! I suppose I am never to smile again.\nWho ever dreamed of marrying?\"\n\n\"Well, I did;\" he answered with a twinkle of his eyes, and squaring of\nhis shoulders. \"I am not too old for everybody; but I am much too old\nfor you. Do you think I would have come here else? But it is high time\nto stop this fun.\"\n\n\"I don't call it fun at all;\" said Tamar, fetching a little sob of\nfright. \"What makes you look so cross at me?\"\n\n\"I did not mean to look cross, my dear.\" The Sergeant's tender heart was\ntouched. \"I should be a brute, if I looked cross. It is the way the Lord\nhas made my eyes. Perhaps they would never do for married life.\"\n\n\"That's the way all of them look,\" said Tamar; \"unless they get\neverything they want. But you didn't look like that, last Sunday.\"\n\n\"No. But I ought. Now settle this. Would you ever think of marrying me?\"\n\n\"No. Not on no account. You may be sure of that. Not even if you was\ndipped in diamonds.\" The spirit of the girl was up, and her true\nvulgarity came out.\n\n\"According to my opinion of you, that would make all the difference;\"\nsaid the Sergeant, also firing up. \"And now, Miss Haddon, let us say\n'Good-bye.'\"\n\n\"Let me come to myself, dear Sergeant Jakes. I never meant to be rude to\nyou. But they do court me so different. Sit down for a minute. It is so\nlonely, and I have heard such frightful things. Father won't be coming\nfor half an hour yet. And after the way you went on, I am so nervous.\nHow my heart goes pit a pat! You brave men cannot understand such\nthings.\"\n\nAt this moving appeal, Mr. Jakes returned, and endeavoured to allay her\nterrors.\n\n\"It is all about those dreadful men,\" she said; \"I cannot sleep at night\nfor thinking of them. You know all about them. If you could only tell me\nwhat you are doing to catch them. They say that you have found out where\nthey went, and are going to put them in jail next week. Is it true?\nPeople do tell such stories. But you found it all out by yourself, and\nyou know all the rights of it.\"\n\nWith a little more coaxing, and trembling, and gasping, she contrived\nto get out of him all that he knew, concerning the matter to the present\ntime. Crang had identified the impressions as the footmarks of the\ndisabled horse; and a search of the cave by torchlight showed that it\nmust have been occupied lately. A large button with a raised rim, such\nas are used on sailors' overalls, had been found near the entrance, and\ninside were prints of an enormous boot, too big for any man in\nPerlycross. Also the search had been carried further, and the tracks of\na horse and a narrow-wheeled cart could be made out here and there,\nuntil a rough flinty lane was come to, leading over the moors to the\nHoniton road. All these things were known to Dr. Fox, and most of them\nto Mr. Penniloe, who had just returned from London, and the matter was\nnow in skilful hands. But everything must be kept very quiet, or the\nchance of pursuing the clue might be lost.\n\nTamar vowed solemnly that she would never tell a word; and away went the\nSergeant, well pleased with himself, as the bells began to ring for the\nafternoon service.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\nTHE OLD MILL.\n\n\nCombing up on the South like a great tidal wave, Hagdon Hill for miles\nlooks down on the beautiful valley of the Perle, and then at the western\nend breaks down into steep declivities and wooded slopes. Here the\nSusscot brook has its sources on the southern side of the long gaunt\nrange, outside the parish of Perlycross; and gathering strength at every\nstretch from flinty trough, and mossy runnel, is big enough to trundle\nan old mill-wheel, a long while before it gets to Joe Crang's forge.\n\nThis mill is situated very sweetly for those who love to be outside the\nworld. It stands at the head of a winding hollow fringed along the crest\nwith golden gorse, wild roses by the thousand, and the silvery gleam of\nbirch. Up this pretty \"goyal\"--as they call it--there is a fine view of\nthe ancient mill, lonely, decrepit, and melancholy, with the flints\ndropping out of its scarred wall-face, the tattered thatch rasping\nagainst the wind, and the big wheel dribbling idly; for the wooden\ncarrier, that used to keep it splashing and spinning merrily, sprawls\naway on its trestles, itself a wreck, broken-backed and bulging.\n\nAnd yet in its time this mill has done well, and pounded the corn of a\nhundred farms; for, strange as it may be, the Perle itself is\nexceedingly shy of mill-work, being broken upon no wheel save those of\nthe staring and white-washed factory which disfigures the village of\nPerlycross. Therefore from many miles around came cart, and butt, and\nvan, and wain, to this out-of-the-way and hard to find, but flourishing\nand useful Tremlett mill. That its glory has departed and its threshold\nis deserted, came to pass through no fault of wheel, or water, or even\nwanton trade seduced by younger rivals. Man alone was to blame, and he\ncould not--seldom incapable as he is of that--even put the fault on\nwoman.\n\nThe Tremletts were of very ancient race, said to be of Norman origin,\nand this mill had been theirs for generations. Thrifty, respectable, and\nhard-working, they had worn out many millstones--one of which had been\nset up in the churchyard, an honour to itself and owner--and patched up\na lot of ages of mill-wheels (the only useful revolution) until there\ncame into the small human sluice a thread of vile weed, that clogged\neverything up. A vein of bad blood that tainted all, varicose, sluggish,\nintractable.\n\nWhat man can explain such things, even to his own satisfaction? Yet\neverybody knows that it is so, and too often with the people who have\nbeen in front of him. Down went the Tremletts for a hundred years--quite\na trifle to such an old family--and the wheel ceased to turn, and the\nhearth had nought to burn, and the brook took to running in a low\nperverted course.\n\nBut even sad things may be beautiful--like the grandest of all human\ntragedies,--and here before Mr. Penniloe's new long-sighted glasses,\nwhich already had a fine effect upon his mind, was a prospect, worth all\nthe three sovereigns he had paid, in addition to the three he had lived\nunder. No monarch of the world--let alone this little isle--could have\ngilded and silvered and pearled and jewelled his most sumptuous palace,\nand his chambers of delight, with a tithe of the beauty here set forth\nby nature, whose adornments come and go, at every breath.\n\nFor there had just been another heavy fall of snow, and the frost\nhaving firm hold of the air, the sun had no more power than a great\nwhite star, glistening rather than shining, and doubtful of his own\ndomain in the multitude of sparkles. Everything that stood across the\nlight was clad with dazzling raiment; branch, and twig, and reed, and\nozier, pillowed with lace of snow above, and fringed with chenille of\nrime below. Under and through this arcade of radiance, stood the old\nmill-wheel--for now it could stand--black, and massive, and leaning on\npellucid pillars of glistering ice.\n\nMr. Penniloe lifted up his heart to God, as he always did at any of His\nglorious works; and then he proceeded to his own less brilliant, but\nequally chilling duty. Several times he knocked vainly at the ricketty\ndoor of the remaining room, until at last a harsh voice cried--\"Come in,\ncan't 'e? Nort for 'e to steal here.\"\n\nThen he pulled the leather thong, an old boot-lace, and the grimy wooden\nlatch clicked up, and the big door staggered inwards. Everything looked\ncold and weist and haggard in the long low room he entered, and\nhunger-stricked, though of solid fabric once, and even now tolerably\nfree from dirt. At the further end, and in a gloomy recess, was a large\nlow bedstead of ancient oak, carved very boldly and with finely flowing\nlines. Upon it lay a very aged woman, of large frame and determined\nface, wearing a high yellow cap, and propped by three coarse pillows,\nupon which fell the folds of a French shawl of rich material.\n\nShe had thick eyebrows, still as black as a coal, and fierce gray eyes\nwith some fire in them still, and a hooked nose that almost overhung a\npointed chin; and her long bony arms lay quivering upon a quilt of\nwell-worn patchwork. She looked at Mr. Penniloe, discerning him clearly\nwithout the aid of spectacles, and saluted him with a slight disdainful\nnod.\n\n\"Oh, Passon is it? Well, what have 'e got to say to me?\" Her voice was\nhard and pitched rather high, and her gaunt jaws worked with a roll of\nwrinkles, intended for a playful grin.\n\n\"Mrs. Tremlett, I was told that you wished to see me, and that it is a\nsolemn moment with you--that soon you will stand in the presence of a\nmerciful but righteous Judge.\"\n\nMr. Penniloe approached her with a kind and gentle look, and offered to\ntake one of her clenched and withered hands, but she turned the knuckles\nto him with a sudden twist, and so sharp were they that they almost cut\nhis palm. He drew back a little, and a flash of spiteful triumph told\nhim that she had meant this rasper for him.\n\n\"Bain't a gwain' to die yet,\" she said; \"I be only ninety-one, and my\nown moother wor ninety-five afore her lost a tooth. I reckon I shall see\n'e out yet, Master Passon; for 'e don't look very brave--no that 'e\ndon't. Wants a little drap out o' my bottle, I conzider.\"\n\nThe clergyman feared that there was little to be done; but he never let\nthe Devil get the best of him, and he betook himself to one of his most\ntrustworthy resources.\n\n\"Mrs. Tremlett, I will with your permission offer a few simple words of\nprayer, not only for you but for myself, my friend. You can repeat the\nwords after me, if you feel disposed.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" she cried, \"stop!\" and threw out both hands with great vigour,\nas he prepared to kneel. \"Why, you ban't gi'en me the zhillin' yet. You\nalways gives Betty Cork a zhillin', afore 'e begins to pray to her.\nBain't my soul worth every varden of what Betty Cork's be?\"\n\nThe Parson was distressed at this inverted view of the value of his\nministrations. Nevertheless he pulled out the shilling, which she\nclapped with great promptitude under her pillow, and then turned her\nback upon him.\n\n\"Goo on now, Passon, as long as ever 'e wull; but not too much noise\nlike, case I might drop off to sleep.\"\n\nHer attitude was not too favourable; but the Curate had met with many\ncases quite as bad, and he never allowed himself to be discouraged. And\nsomething perhaps in his simple words, or the powers of his patient\nhumility, gave a better and a softer turn to the old woman's moody mind.\n\n\"Passon, be you a _h_onest man?\" she enquired, when he had risen,\naffording that adjective a special roughness, according to the manner of\nDevon. \"B'lieve 'e be a good man. But be 'e _h_onest?\"\n\n\"My goodness, as you call it, would be very small indeed, unless I were\nhonest, Mrs. Tremlett. Without honesty, all is hypocrisy.\"\n\n\"And you bain't no hypocrite; though 'e may be a vule. Most fine\nscholards is big vules, and half-scholards always maketh start for\nrogues. But I'll trust 'e, Passon; and the Lord will strike 'e dead,\nbeing in his white sleeves, every Zunday, if 'e goo again the truth.\nWhat do 'e say to that, Passon Penniloe? What do 'e think now of that\nthere? And thee praying for me, as if I hadn't got ne'er a coffin's\nworth!\"\n\nThe old lady pulled out a canvas bag, and jingled it against Mr.\nPenniloe's gray locks. Strong vitality was in her face. How could she\ndie, with all that to live for?\n\n\"Vifty-two guineas of Jarge the Zecond. T'other come to the throne afore\nI did it; but his head wasn't out much, and they might goo back of his\n'en. So I took 'un of the man as come afore, and there they has been\never since--three score years, and ten, and two. The Lord knoweth, if He\nreckon'th up the sparrows, what a fine young woman I were then. There\nbain't such a one in all the County now. Six foot high, twenty inch\nacross the shoulders, and as straight as a hazel wand sucker'd from the\nroot. Have mercy on you, Passon! Your wife, as used to come to see me,\nwas a very purty woman. But in the time of my delight, I could 'a taken\nher with one hand, and done--well, chucked her over Horse-shoe.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Mr. Penniloe asked, and his quiet eyes bore down the\nboastful gaze, and altered the tone of the old virago.\n\n\"Nort, sir, nort. It bain't no use to worrit me. Her tumbled off the\nclift, and her bruk her purty nack. Her was spying too much after\nconey's holes, I reckon. But her always waz that tender-hearted. You\nbain't fit to hold a can'le to her, with all your precious prayers and\nlitanies. But I'll trust 'e, Passon, for her zake. Vetch thiccy old book\nout o' cubbert.\"\n\nIn the cupboard near the fireplace he found an ancient Bible, bound in\nblack leather, and fortified with silver clasps and corners.\n\n\"Hold that there book in your right hand, and this here bag in t'other;\"\nthe old lady still clave to the bag, as if far more precious than the\nBible--\"and then you say slowly after me, same as I was to do the\nprayers, 'I, Passon Penniloe, of Perlycross, Christian Minister, do\nhereby make oath and swear that I will do with this bag of money as\nZipporah Tremlett telleth me, so help me God Almighty.'\"\n\n\"Stop, if you please. I will make no such promise, until I know all\nabout it;\" objected Mr. Penniloe, while she glared at him with rising\nanger, and then nodded as something occurred to her.\n\n\"Well, then, I'll tell 'e fust; and no call for prabbles. This money\nbain't none o' they Tremletts; every varden of theirs is gone long ago,\nalthough they had ten times so much as this, even while I can mind of\n'un. All this, except for a bit of a sto'un in the lower cornder, and\nthat hath been hunderds of years with the Tremletts, but all the rest\ncometh from my own father, and none on 'em knoweth a word of it.\nWouldn't believe if they did, I reckon. Zippy, that's my grand-darter as\nminds me, her hath orders to burn for her life and vetch you--night or\nday, mind,--fust moment the breath be gone out of my body. And every\nvarden of it is for she. You be to take it from this here little nestie,\nwi'out a word to no one, and keep it zealed up under lock and key, till\nZippy be eighteen year of age, and then, accordin' to your oath, you\nputt it into her two hands. If 'e do that, Passon, I'll die a Christian,\nand you be welcome of me to your churchyard. But if 'e wun't do it, then\nI'll die a hathen, and never go to no churchyard, same as scores and\nscores of the Tremletts is. Now, do 'e care for the soul of an old\n'ooman? Or would 'e soonder her went to the Devil?\"\n\nBy this alternative the Curate felt much pressure put upon his\nconscience. If there were no other way to save her, he must even\ndispense with legal form, and accept a trust, which might for all he\nknew defraud the Revenue of legacy duty, and even some honest solicitor\nof a contribution to his livelihood. But first he must be certain that\nthe scheme was just and rational.\n\n\"No fear of robbing nobody. They Tremletts be a shocking lot,\" she said,\nwith amiable candour. \"Just slip the wedge on top of latch, for fear one\non 'em should come to see if I be dead; though I reckon, this weather,\nit would be too much for either son or darter. Wouldn't 'em burn, if 'em\nknowed of this? But here I may lie and be worm-eaten. And chillers of my\nown--my own buys and girls. Dree quarters of a score I've had, and not\none on 'em come anigh me! Never was a harrier-bird could fly so fast as\nevery one on 'em would, to this old bed, if 'em knowed what be in it.\nNo, I be a liar--every one on 'em can't, because the biggest half be\ngone. Twelve buys there was, and dree wenches of no count. Dree buys was\nhanged, back in time of Jarge the Third, to Exeter jail, for\nship-staling, and one to Gibbet-moor, for what a' did upon the road.\nVour on 'em was sent over seas, for running a few bits of goods from\nFrance. Two on 'em be working to Whetstone pits, 'cording to their own\naccount, though I reckon they does another sort of job, now and again.\nAnd as for t'other two, the Lord, or the Devil, knoweth what be come to\nthey. Not one on 'em comes nigh poor old moother, who might a' died\nyears ago 'cep for little Zippy. Though little Zip's father have a' been\nhere now and then. The biggest and the wildest of the dozen I call him,\nthough a' kapeth wonderful out of jail. 'Tis his cheel he comes to see,\nnot his poor old moother. Look 'e ere, Passon, all the ins and outs of\n'un be set down rarely in that there book; same as the game with lines\nand crosses we used to play with a oyster-shell, fourscore years agone\nand more.\"\n\nOn three or four leaves of the ancient Bible, bound in for that purpose,\nwas a pedigree of these Tremletts of the Mill, descending from the\nfourteenth century. Mr. Penniloe looked at it with no small interest.\nWhat a pity to find them come to this! The mill itself had been a fall\nno doubt; but the Whetstone pits were a great descent from that.\n\n\"Tremletts has always had one or two fine scholards\"--the old woman had\na strange theory about this. \"'Twor all along o' that they come down so.\nWhenever any man taketh much to books, a' stoppeth up his ears to good\nadvice, and a' heedeth of his headpiece, and robbeth of 's own belly.\nBut there, no matter. I can do a bit myself. Have 'e made up your mind\nabout my poor soul?\"\n\nFrom the toss of her nose, Mr. Penniloe was afraid that she was not much\nin earnest about that little matter. And in common sense, he was loth to\nget entangled with the nettles and briars of such a queer lot.\n\n\"I think, Mrs. Tremlett,\" he said, with a smile containing some light of\nwavering, \"that your wisest plan by far would be to have a short will\ndrawn up, and leave the money----\"\n\n\"Gi'e me my bag, and go thy ways,\" she screamed in a fury, though the\nbag was in her claws. \"No churchyard for me, and my soul at thy door,\nthou white-livered, black-smocked Passon!\"\n\nHer passion struck into her lungs or throat, and she tore at her scraggy\nchest, to ease the pain and gripe of a violent coughing-fit. Mr.\nPenniloe supported her massive head, for if it fell back, it might never\nrise again.\n\n\"A drap out o' bottle!\" she gasped at last, pointing to the cupboard\nwhere the Bible had been. He propped up her head with a pillow on end,\nand took from the cupboard a long-necked bottle of the best French\nbrandy, and a metal pannikin.\n\n\"No watter! No watter!\" the old woman shrieked, as he went towards a\npitcher that stood by the chimney. \"Watter spileth all. No vear. Vill\nup!\"\n\nHe gave her the pannikin full, and she tipped it off, like a mouthful of\nmilk, and then sat up and looked at him steadily.\n\n\"I be no drunkard,\" she said, \"though a man as knoweth nort might vancy\nit. Never touches that stuff, excep' for physic. I've a' seed too much\nwhat comes of that. Have a drap, wull 'e? Clane glass over yanner.\"\n\nShe seemed annoyed again at his refusal, but presently subsided into a\nmilder vein, as if she were soothed by the mighty draught, instead of\nbecoming excited.\n\n\"Naden't have troubled 'e, Passon,\" she said, \"but for zending of little\nZip away. I'll tell 'e why, now just. Better cheel never lived than\nlittle Zip. Her tendeth old grannie night and day, though her getteth a\ntap on the head now and then. But her mustn't know of this here money,\nor her father'd have it out of her in two zeconds. Now 'e see why I\nwon't make no will. Now, will 'e do what I axed of 'e?\"\n\nAfter some hesitation the Parson gave his promise. He had heard from his\nwife about poor little Zip, and how faithful she was to her old\ngrandmother; and he felt that it would be unfair to the child to deprive\nher of the chance in life this money might procure; while he knew that\nif he declined the trust, not a penny would she ever see of it. He\ninsisted however upon one precaution--that the owner should sign a\nmemorandum of the gift, and place it with the guineas in the bag, and\nthen hand the whole to him as trustee, completing by delivery the\n_donatio mortis caus\u00c3\u00a2_. In spite of her sufferings from the ruinous\neffects of the higher education, Zipporah could sign her name very\nfairly, and a leaf of her grandchild's copybook served very well for the\nmemorial prepared by Mr. Penniloe.\n\n\"Now rouse up the fire there, 'e must be frore a'most,\" Mrs. Tremlett\nsaid when that was finished, and she had shown him where she concealed\nthe treasure. \"'One good toorn desarves another,' as I've heerd say,\nthough never had much chance of proving it; and I could tell 'e a thing\nor two, 'e might be glad to know, Passon Penniloe, wi'out doing harm to\nnobody. Fust place then, you mind hearing of the man as gi'ed that\ndoiled zany of a blacksmith such a turn--how long agone was it? I can't\nsay justly; but the night after Squire Waldron's vuneral.\"\n\n\"To be sure. The big man with the lame horse, at Susscot Ford.\"\n\n\"Well, that man was my son Harvey, little Zip's father. You see the name\nin big Bible. French name it waz then, spelled different, and with a\nstroke to the tail, as maight be. Tremletts had a hankering after\nforeign languages. See 'un all down the page you can.\"\n\n\"What, Mrs. Tremlett!\" exclaimed the Parson. \"Are you aware what you are\ndoing? Informing against your own son--and one of the very few\nremaining!\"\n\n\"Zober now, zober! Don't 'e be a vule, Passon. I knows well enough what\nI be adoing of. Just I wants 'un out of way, till arter I be buried\nlike. I zent his little darter to the pits to-day, to tell 'un as how\nyou knowed of it. That'll mak 'un cut sticks, till I be underground, I\nreckon.\"\n\nAs the old woman grinned and nodded at her own sagacity, a horrible idea\ncrossed the mind of Mr. Penniloe. Could she be afraid that her own son\nwould dig up her body, and dispose of it?\n\nBefore he had condemned himself for such a vile suspicion, Mrs. Tremlett\nseemed to have read his thoughts; for she smiled with bitter glory, as\nif she had caught a pious man yielding to impiety.\n\n\"No, Harvey bain't no body-snatcher--leastways not as I ever heer'd on;\nthough most volk would say a' was bad enough for anything. All that I\nwants 'un out of way for, is that he mayn't have the chance to rob his\ndarter. He loveth of the little maid, so much as Old Nick 'loweth him.\nBut he could never kape his hands out of this here bag, if a' zeed 'un.\nAnd as for your folk doin' any hurt to 'un, 'twould be more use for 'e\nto drive nails into a shadow, than to lay hold of Harvey when he knoweth\nyou be arter 'un. And even if 'e wor to vind 'un, man alive, it would be\na bad job for you, or for zix such men as you be, to come nigh the hands\nof Harvey Tremlett. Volk about these parts don't know nort of un', else\nthey'd have had un' for the 'rastling long ago. He hath been about a\ngood deal among the Gipsies, and sailor-folk, and so on; and the Lord\nknows He musn't look for too very much of good in 'un.\"\n\n\"We must make allowances, Mrs. Tremlett. We never do justice to our\nfellow-men, in that way.\" Mr. Penniloe was saying to himself, while he\nspoke--\"and a great deal must be allowed for such bringing-up as yours,\nma'am. But have you anything more to tell me, about that shocking thing,\nthat is such a sad disgrace to Perlycross?\" The Parson buttoned up his\nSpencer, as if he still felt that dirty Pack's hits below the belt.\n\n\"I could tell 'e a saight of things, if I waz so minded, about what they\nvules to Perlycross, and you among t'others be mazed about. I can't make\n'un out myself; but I be free to swear you'm a passel of idiots.\nTremletts was bad enough; no vamley could be worse a'most; and much\nolder they was than any Waldrons. But none on 'em never was dug up for\ngenerations. Won'erful things has come to them--things as would fill\nbooks bigger than this Bible; because 'em always wor above the lids of\nthe ten Commandments. But 'em always had peace, so soon as they was\ndead, till such time as the Devil could come for 'un, and he don't care\nfor no corpses. They Waldrons is tame--no French blood in 'em. Vitted\nfor big pews in church, and big vunerals. Vellers not laikely to be dug\nup, when that waz never done to Tremletts. Passon, I could tell 'e such\na saight of things, as would make the hair creep round the head of thee.\nCan't talk no more, or my cough will come on. Will tell 'e all about\nyour little boy, Mike; if 'e come again when this vrost is over. And\nthen I'll show 'e Zip. But I can't talk vair, while the houze be so\ncold. I've a dooed too much to-day, for a 'ooman in her ninety-zecond\nyear. You come again about this day wake. I trust 'e now, Passon. You be\na good man, because you'm got no good blood in you. A old 'ooman's\nblessing won't do 'e no harm.\"\n\nVast is the power of a good kind face, and of silence at the proper\nmoment. The Curate of Perlycross possessed that large and tender nature,\nat which the weak are apt to scoff, because they are not afraid of it.\nOver them no influence can last, for there is nothing to lay hold of.\nBut a strong-willed person, like that old woman, has substance that can\nbe dealt with, if handled kindly and without pretence. Thus Mr. Penniloe\nindulged some hope of soothing and softening that fierce and flinty\nnature, and guiding it towards that peace on earth, which is the surest\ntoken of the amnesty above.\n\nBut while he was at breakfast on the following day, he was told that a\nlittle maid was at the front door, crying very bitterly, and refusing to\ncome in. He went out alone, but not a syllable would she utter, until he\nhad closed the door behind him. There she stood, shivering in the snow,\nand sobbing, very poorly dressed, and with nothing on her head, but\nmopping her eyes and nose, as she turned away, with a handkerchief of\nthe finest lace.\n\n\"Zip,\" was all the answer Mr. Penniloe could get to his gentle enquiry\nas to who she was; and then she looked at him with large and lustrous\neyes, beautifully fringed below as well as above, and announcing very\nclearly that she was discussing him within. Although he guessed what her\nerrand was, the clergyman could not help smiling at her earnest and\nundisguised probation of his character; and that smile settled the issue\nin his favour.\n\n\"You be to coom to wance;\" her vowel-sounds were of the purest\nDevonshire air, winged by many a quill, but never summed in pen by any;\n\"Wi'out no stapping to think, you be to coom!\"\n\n\"What an imperious little Zenobia!\" said Mr. Penniloe, in self-commune.\n\n\"Dunno, whatt thiccy be. Grandmoother zayeth, 'e must coom to wance. But\nher be dead, zince the can'le gooed out.\" Her eyes burst into another\nflood, and she gave up the job of sopping it.\n\n\"My dear. I will come with you, in half a minute. Come and stand in the\nwarmth, till I am ready.\"\n\n\"Noo. Noo. I bain't to stop. Putt on hat, and coom raight awai. Vire\ngooed out, and can'le gooed out, and Grannie gooed out, along wi' 'un.\"\n\nMr. Penniloe huddled his Spencer on, while the staring child danced with\nimpatience in the snow; and quiet little Fay came and glanced at her,\nand wondered how such things could be. But Fay would not stare, because\nshe was a little lady.\n\nThe clergyman was very quick of foot; but the child with her long\nTremlett legs kept easily in front of him all the way, with the cloud of\nher black hair blowing out, on the frosty air, to hurry him.\n\n\"I bain't aveared of her. Be you?\" said the little maid, as she rose on\ntip-toe, to pull the thong of the heavy latch. \"If her coom back, her\nwould zay--'Good cheel, Zippy!'\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.\n\nPANIC.\n\n\nChristmas Day fell on a Friday that year, and the funeral of that\nancient woman took place on the previous afternoon. The Curate had never\nread the burial-service, before so small an audience. For the weather\nwas bitterly cold, and poor Mrs. Tremlett had outlived all her friends,\nif she ever had any; no one expected a farthing from her, and no one\ncared to come and shudder at her grave. Of all her many descendants\nnone, except the child Zip, was present; and she would have stood alone\nupon the frozen bank, unless Mrs. Muggridge had very kindly offered to\ncome and hold the shivering and streaming little hand.\n\nWhat was to be done with Zip? Nobody came forward. There were hundreds\nof kind people in the parish, and dozens to whom the poor waif would\nhave been a scarcely perceptible burden. Yet nobody cared to have a\nTremlett at his hearth, and everybody saw the duty marked out for his\nneighbour.\n\n\"Then I will take her;\" said Mr. Penniloe with his true benevolence,\n\"but the difficulty is where to place her. She cannot well be among my\nchildren yet, until I know more about her. And, although the old family\nis so reduced, the kitchen is scarcely the place for her.\" However, that\nquestion soon answered itself; and though little Zip was at first a sad\npuzzle (especially to the staid Muggridge), her grateful and loving\nnature soon began to win a warm hold and a tranquil home for her.\n\nThat winter, although it began rather early, was not of prolonged\nseverity, for the frost broke up on Christmas night, at least in the\nwest of England, with a heavy fall of snow which turned to rain. But\nChristmas Day itself was very bright and pleasant, with bracing air,\nhard frozen snow, and firm sunshine throwing long shadows on it, and\nsparkling on the icicles from thatch and spout and window-frame. As the\nboys of the Sunday school filed out, at the call of the bells in the\ntower chiming (after long silence while the arch was being cut) and as\nthey formed into grand procession, under the military eye of Jakes,\njoyfully they watched their cloudy breath ascending, or blew it in a\ncolumn on some other fellow's cap. Visions were before them,--a\npageantry of joy, a fortnight of holidays, a fortnight of sliding, snow\nballing, bone-runners, Cooper Baker's double-hoops, why not even skates?\n\nBut alas, even now the wind was backing, as the four vanes with rare\nunanimity proclaimed, a white fog that even a boy could stand out of was\nstealing up the valley, while the violet tone of the too transparent\nsky, and the whiteness of the sun (which used to be a dummy fireball),\nand even the short sharp clack of the bells, were enough to tell any boy\nwith weather eyes and ears, that the nails on his heels would do no\ncobbler's click again, till the holiday time was over.\n\nBut blessed are they who have no prophetic gift, be it of the weather,\nor of things yet more unstable. All went to church in a happy frame of\nmind; and the Parson in a like mood looked upon them. Every head was\nthere that he had any right to count, covered or uncovered. Of the\nlatter perhaps more than a Sunday would produce; of the former not so\nmany, but to a Christian mind enough; for how shall a great\nchurch-festival be kept without a cook? But the ladies who were there\nwere in very choice attire, happy in having nothing but themselves to\ndress; all in good smiling condition, and reserving for home use their\ncandid reviews of one another.\n\nThere was the genial and lively Mrs. Farrant, whose good word and good\nsayings everybody valued; close at her side was her daughter Minnie,\nprovided by nature with seasonable gifts--lips more bright than the\nholly-berry, teeth more pearly than mistletoe, cheeks that proved the\nhardiness of the rose in Devon, and eyes that anticipated Easter-tide\nwith the soft glance of the Forget-me-not. Then there was Mrs. John\nHorner, _interdum aspera cornu_, but _foenum habens_ for the roast-beef\ntime; and kind Mrs. Anning (quite quit of this tale, though the Perle\nruns through her orchard), and tall Mrs. Webber with two pretty\ngirls--all purely distinct from the lawyer--and Mrs. James Hollyer, and\nMrs. John Hollyer, both great in hospitality; and others of equally\nworthy order, for whom the kind hearts of Bright and Cobden would have\nached, had they not been blind seers.\n\nTo return to our own sheep, themselves astray, there was no denying Mrs.\nGilham, looking still a Christian, up a fathom of sea-green bonnet; and\nher daughter Rose, now so demure if ever she caught a wandering eye,\nthat it had to come again to beg pardon; and by her side a young man\nstood, with no eyes at all for the prettiest girl inside the sacred\nbuilding!\n\nBut strange as it may seem, he had eyes enough and to spare, for a young\nman opposite; whose face he perused with perpetual enquiry, which the\nother understood, but did not want to apprehend. For instance, \"How is\nyour very darling sister? Have you heard from her by the latest post?\nDid she say anything about me? When is she coming to Perlycross again?\nDo you think she is reading the same Psalm that we are? Have they got\nany Christmas parties on? I hope there is no mistletoe up that way, or\nat any rate no hateful fellow near her with it?\"\n\nThese, and fifty other points of private worship, not to be discovered\nin the Book of Common Prayer--even by the cleverest anagram of\nRitualist--did Frank Gilham vainly strive to moot with Jemmy Fox across\nthe aisle, instead of being absorbed and rapt in the joyful tidings of\nthe day.\n\nNeither was Jemmy Fox a ha'porth more devout. With the innate\nselfishness of all young men, he had quite another dish of fish to fry\nfor his own plate. As for Frank Gilham's, he would upset it joyfully, in\nspite of all sympathy or gratitude. And, if so low a metaphor can ever\nbe forgiven, Jemmy's fish, though not in sight but in a brambly corner,\nwas fairly hooked and might be felt; whereas Frank Gilham's, if she had\never seen his fly, had (so far as he could be sure) never even opened\nmouth to take it; but had sailed away upstream, leaving a long furrow,\nas if--like the celebrated trout in Crocker's Hole--she scorned any\ntackle a poor farmer could afford.\n\nFox, on the other hand, had reasonable hopes, that patience and\ndiscretion and the flowing stream of time, would bring his lovely prize\nto bank at last. For the chief thing still against him was that black\nand wicked charge: and even now he looked at all the women in the\nchurch, with very little interest in their features, but keen enquiry as\nto their expression. His eyes put the question to them, one after\nanother,--\"My good madam, are you still afraid of me?\" And sad to say,\nthe answer from too many of them was--\"Well, I had rather not shake\nhands with you, till you have cleared your reputation.\" So certain is it\nthat if once a woman has believed a thing--be it good, or be it\nevil--nothing but the evidence of her own eyes will uproot that belief;\nand sometimes not even that.\n\nEspecially now with Lady Waldron, Fox felt certain that his case stood\nthus; that in spite of all the arguments of Christie and of Inez, he was\nnot yet acquitted, though less stubbornly condemned; and as long as that\nstate of things lasted, he could not (with proper self-respect) press\nhis suit upon the daughter. For it should be observed that he had no\ndoubt yet of the genuine strength of her ladyship's suspicions. Mr.\nPenniloe had not thought it right or decent, placed as he was towards\nthe family, to impart to young Jemmy Sir Harrison Gowler's hateful\n(because misogynic) conclusions.\n\nThat excellent preacher, and noble exemplar, the Reverend Philip\nPenniloe, gave out his text in a fine sonorous voice, echoing through\nthe great pillars of his heart, three words--as many as can ever rouse\nan echo--and all of them short,--\"On earth, peace.\"\n\nHe was gazing on his flock with large good will, and that desire to see\nthe best side of them which is creditable to both parties; for take them\naltogether they were a peaceful flock--when a crack, as of thunder and\nlightning all in one, rang in every ear, and made a stop in every heart.\nBefore any body could start up to ask about it, a cavernous rumble\nrolled into a quick rattle; and then deep silence followed.\n\nNervous folk started up, slower persons stared about, even the coolest\nand most self-possessed doubted their arrangements for the Day of\nJudgment. The sunlight was shining through the south aisle windows, and\nnone could put the blame on any storm outside.\n\nThen panic arose, as at a trumpet-call. People huddled anyhow, to rush\nout of their pews, without even sense enough to turn the button-latch.\nBald heads were plunging into long-ribboned bonnets, fathers forgot\ntheir children, young men their sweethearts, but mothers pushed their\nlittle ones before them. \"Fly for dear life\"--was the impulse of the\nmen; \"save the life dearer than my own\"--was of the women. That is the\nmoment to be sure what love is.\n\n\"Sit still boys, or I'll skin you\"--Sergeant Jakes' voice was heard\nabove the uproar; many believed that the roof was falling in; every kind\nof shriek and scream abounded.\n\n\"My friends,\" said Mr. Penniloe, in a loud clear voice, and lifting up\nhis Bible calmly, \"remember in Whose house, and in Whose hands we are.\nIt is but a fall of something in the chancel. It cannot hurt you.\nPerhaps some brave man will go behind the screen, and just tell us what\nhas happened. I would go myself, if I could leave the pulpit.\"\n\nPeople were ashamed, when they saw little Fay run from her seat to the\nnewly-finished steps, and begin groping at the canvas, while she smiled\nup at her father. In a moment three men drew her back and passed in.\nThey were Jemmy Fox, Frank Gilham, and the gallant Jakes; and a cloud of\ndust floated out as they vanished. Courage returned and the rush and\ncrush was stayed, while Horner and Farrant, the two churchwardens, came\nwith long strides to join the explorers.\n\nDeep silence reigned when Doctor Fox returned, and at the request of\nFarmer John, addressed the Parson so that all could hear. \"There is no\ndanger, sir, of any further fall. There has been a sort of settlement of\nthe south-east corner. The stone screen is cracked, and one end of it\nhas dropped, and the small lancet window has tumbled in. All is now\nquite firm again. There is not the smallest cause for fear.\"\n\n\"Thank God!\" said Mr. Penniloe, \"and thank you my friends, for telling\nus. And now, as soon as order is quite restored, I shall beg to return\nto the discussion of my text, which with your permission I will read\nagain.\"\n\nAs soon as he had finished a very brief discourse, worthy of more\nattention than it could well secure, his flock hurried gladly away, with\nmuch praise of his courage and presence of mind, but no thought of the\nheavy loss and sad blow cast upon him. Fox alone remained behind, to\noffer aid and sympathy, when the Parson laid his gown aside and came to\nlearn the worst of it. They found that the south-east corner of the\nchancel-wall, with the external quoin and two buttresses, had parted\nfrom the rest, and sunk bodily to the depth of a yard or more, bearing\naway a small southern window, a portion of the roof and several panels\nof that equally beautiful and unlucky screen.\n\nAt a rough guess, at least another hundred pounds would be required to\nmake good the damage. It was not only this, but the sense of mishaps so\nfrequent and unaccountable--few of which have been even mentioned\nhere--that now began to cast heavy weight and shadow, upon the cheerful\nheart of Penniloe. For it seemed as if all things combined against him,\nboth as regarded the work itself, and the means by which alone it could\nbe carried on. And this last disaster was the more depressing, because\nno cause whatever could be found for it. That wall had not been meddled\nwith in any way externally, because it seemed quite substantial. And\neven inside there had been but little done to it, simply a shallow\nexcavation made, for the plinth, or footings, of the newly erected\nscreen.\n\n\"Never mind, sir,\" said Fox; \"it can soon be put to rights; and your\nbeautiful screen will look ever so much better without that lancet\nwindow, which has always appeared to me quite out of place.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" replied the Parson, in a sad low voice, and with a shake of\nhis head which meant--\"all very fine; but how on earth am I to get the\nmoney?\"\n\nEven now the disaster was not complete. Subscriptions had grown slack,\nand some had even been withdrawn, on the niggardly plea that no church\nwas worth preserving, which could not protect even its own dead. And now\nthe news of this occurrence made that matter worse again, for the blame\nof course fell upon Penniloe. \"What use to help a man, who cannot help\nhimself?\" \"A fellow shouldn't meddle with bricks and mortar, unless he\nwas brought up to them.\" \"I like him too well, to give him another\npenny. If I did he'd pull the tower down upon his own head.\" Thus and\nthus spoke they who should have flown to the rescue; some even friendly\nenough to deal the coward's blow at the unfortunate.\n\nMoreover, that very night the frost broke up, with a fall of ten inches\nof watery snow, on the wet back of which came more than half an inch of\nrain, the total fall being two inches and three quarters. The ground was\ntoo hard to suck any of it in; water by the acre lay on streaky fields\nof ground-ice; every gateway poured its runnel, and every flinty lane\nits torrent. The Perle became a roaring flood, half a mile wide in the\nmarshes; and the Susscot brook dashed away the old mill-wheel, and\nwhirled some of it down as far as Joe Crang's anvil, fulfilling thereby\nan old prophecy. Nobody could get--without swimming horse or self--from\nPerlycombe to Perlycross, or from Perlycross to Perliton; and old mother\nPods was drowned in her own cottage. The view of the valley, from either\nBeacon Hill or Hagdon, was really grand for any one tall enough to wade\nso far up the weltering ways. Old Channing vowed that he had never seen\nsuch a flood, and feared that the big bridge would be washed away; but\nnow was seen the value of the many wide arches, which had puzzled\nChristie Fox in the distance. Alas for the Hopper, that he was so far\naway at this noble time for a cross-country run! But he told Pike\nafterwards, and Mrs. Muggridge too, that he had a good time of it, even\nin the Mendips.\n\nIn this state of things, the condition of the chancel, with the\nshattered roof yawning to the reek of the snow-slides, and a Southern\ngale hurling floods in at the wall-gaps, may better be imagined than\ndescribed, as a swimming rat perhaps reported to his sodden family. And\npeople had a fine view of it at the Sunday service, for the canvas\ncurtain had failed to resist the swag and the bellying of the blast, and\nhad fallen in a squashy pile, and formed a rough breakwater for the\nmortary lake behind it.\n\nThere was nothing to be done for the present except to provide against\nfurther mischief. The masons from Exeter had left work, by reason of the\nfrost, some time ago; but under the directions of Mr. Richard Horner the\nquoin was shored up, and the roof and window made waterproof with\ntarpaulins. So it must remain till Easter now; when the time of year,\nand possibly a better tide of money, might enable beaten Christians to\nput shoulder to the hod again. Meanwhile was there any chance of finding\nany right for the wrong, which put every man who looked forward to his\ngrave out of all conceit with Perlycross?\n\n\"Vaither, do 'e care to plaze your luving darter, as 'e used to doo? Or\nbe 'e channged, and not the zame to her?\"\n\n\"The vurry za-am. The vurry za-am,\" Mr. Penniloe answered, with his eyes\nglad to rest on her, yet compelled by his conscience to correct her\nvowel sounds. It had long been understood between them, that Fay might\nforsake upon occasion what we now call 'higher culture,' and try her\nlissome tongue at the soft Ionic sounds, which those who know nothing of\nthe West call _Doric_.\n\n\"Then vaither,\" cried the child, rising to the situation; \"whatt vor do\n'e putt both han's avore the eyes of 'e? The Lard in heaven can zee 'e,\narl the zaam.\"\n\nThe little girl was kneeling with both elbows on a chair, and her chin\nset up stedfastly between her dimpled hands, while her clear eyes,\ngleaming with the tears she was repressing, dwelt upon her father's\ndowncast face.\n\n\"My darling, my own darling, you are the image of your mother,\" Mr.\nPenniloe exclaimed, as he rose, and caught her up. \"What is the mammon\nof this world to heaven's angels?\"\n\nAfter that his proper course would have been to smoke a pipe, if that\nform of thank-offering had been duly recommended by the rising school of\nChurchmen. His omission however was soon repaired; for, before he could\neven relapse towards \"the blues,\" the voice of a genuine smoker was\nheard, and the step of a man of substance, the time being now the\nafternoon of Monday.\n\n\"Halloa, Penniloe!\" this gentleman exclaimed; \"How are you, this\nfrightful weather? Very glad to see you. Made a virtue of necessity;\ncan't have the hounds out, and so look up my flock. Never saw the waters\nout so much in all my life. _Nancy_ had to swim at Susscot ford. Thought\nwe should have been washed down, but Crang threw us a rope. Says nobody\ncould cross yesterday. _Nancy_ must have a hot wash, please Mrs.\nMuggridge. I'll come and see to it, if you'll have the water hot.\nHarry's looking after her till I come back. Like to see a boy that takes\nkindly to a horse. What a job I had to get your back-gate open! Never\nuse your stable-yard, it seems. Beats me, how any man can live without a\nhorse! Well, my dear fellow, I hope the world only deals with you,\naccording to your merits. Bless my heart, why, that can never be Fay!\nWhat a little beauty! Got a kiss to spare, my dear? Don't be afraid of\nme. Children always love me. Got one little girl just your height. Won't\nI make her jealous, when I get home? Got something in my vady, that will\nmake your pretty eyes flash. Come, come, Penniloe, this won't do. You\ndon't look at all the thing. Want a thirty mile ride, and a drop of\nbrown mahogany--put a little colour into your learned face. Just you\nshould have a look at my son, Jack. Mean him for this little puss, if\never he grows good enough. Not a bad fellow though. And how's your\nlittle Mike? Why there he is, peeping round the corner! I'll have it out\nwith him, when I've had some dinner. Done yours, I daresay? Anything\nwill do for me. A rasher of bacon, and a couple of poached eggs is a\ndinner for a lord, I say. You don't eat enough, that's quite certain.\nSaw an awful thing in the papers last week. Parsons are going to\nintroduce fasting! Protestant parsons, mind you! Can't believe it. Shall\nhave to join the Church of Rome, if they do. All jolly fellows\nthere--never saw a lean one. I suppose I am about the last man you\nexpected to turn up. Glad to see you though, upon my soul! You don't\nlike that expression--ha, how well I know your face! Strictly clerical I\ncall it though; or at any rate, professional. But bless my heart\nalive--if you like that better--what has all our parish been about? Why\na dead man belongs to the parson, not the doctor. The doctors have done\nfor him, and they ought to have done with him. But we parsons never back\none another up. Not enough colour in the cloth, I always say. Getting\ntoo much of black, and all black.\"\n\nThe Rev. John Chevithorne, Rector of the parish, was doing his best at\nthe present moment to relieve \"the cloth\" of that imputation. For his\ncoat was dark green, and his waistcoat of red shawl-stuff, and his\nbreeches of buff corduroy, while his boots--heavy jack-boots coming\nhalfway up the thigh--might have been of any colour under the sun,\nwithout the sun knowing what the colour was, so spattered, and\nplastered, and cobbed with mud were they. And throughout all his talk,\nhe renewed the hand-shakes, in true pump-handle fashion, at short\nintervals, for he was strongly attached to his Curate. They had been at\nthe same College, and on the same staircase; and although of different\nstanding and very different characters, had taken to one another with a\nliking which had increased as years went on. Mr. Penniloe had an\nEnglishman's love of field-sports; and though he had repressed it from\ndevotion to his calling, he was too good a Christian to condemn those\nwho did otherwise.\n\n\"Chevithorne, I have wanted you most sadly,\" he said, as soon as his\nguest was reclad from his vady, and had done ample justice to rashers\nand eggs; \"I am really ashamed of it, but fear greatly that I shall have\nto be down upon you again. Children, you may go, and get a good run\nbefore dark. Things have been going on--in fact the Lord has not seemed\nto prosper this work at all.\"\n\n\"If you are going to pour forth a cloud of sorrows, you won't mind my\nblowing one of comfort.\"\n\nThe Rector was a pleasant man to look at, and a pleasant one to deal\nwith, if he liked his customer. But a much sharper man of the world than\nhis Curate; prompt, resolute, and penetrating, short in his manner, and\nwhen at all excited, apt to indulge himself in the language of the\nlaity.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, after listening to the whole Church history, \"I am not\na rich man, as you know, my friend. People suppose that a man with three\nlivings must be rolling in money, and all that. They never think twice\nof the outgoings. And Jack goes to Oxford in January. That means\nsomething, as you and I know well. Though he has promised me not to hunt\nthere; and he is a boy who never goes back from his word. But Chancel of\ncourse is my special business. Will you let me off for fifty, at any\nrate for the present? And don't worry yourself about the debt. We'll\nmake it all right among us. Our hunt will come down with another fifty,\nif I put it before them to the proper tune, when they come back to work,\nafter this infernal muck. Only you mustn't look like this. The world\ngets worse and worse, every day, and can't spare the best man it\ncontains. You should have seen the rick of hay I bought last week, just\nbecause I didn't push my knuckles into it. Thought I could trust my\nbrother Tom's churchwarden. And Tom laughs at me; which digs it in too\nhard. Had a rise out of him last summer though, and know how to do him\nagain for Easter-offerings. Tom is too sharp for a man who has got no\nfamily. Won't come down with twopence for Jack's time at Oxford. And he\nhas got all the Chevithorne estates, you know. Nothing but the copyhold\ncame to me. Always the way of the acres, with a man who could put a\nchild to stand on every one of them. However, you never hear me\ncomplain. But surely you ought to get more out of those Waldrons. An\noffering to the Lord _in memoriam_--a proper view of chastisement; have\nyou tried to work it up?\"\n\n\"I have not been able to take that view of it,\" Mr. Penniloe answered,\nsmiling for a moment, though doubtful of the right to do so. \"How can I\nask them for another farthing, after what has happened? And leaving\nthat aside, I am now in a position in which it would be unbecoming. You\nmay have heard that I am Trustee for a part of the Waldron estates, to\nsecure a certain sum for the daughter, Nicie.\"\n\n\"Then that puts it out of the question,\" said the Rector; \"I know what\nthose trust-plagues are. I call them a tax upon good repute. 'The\nfriendly balm that breaks the head.' I never understood that passage,\ntill in a fool's moment I accepted a Trusteeship. However, go on with\nthat Waldron affair. They are beginning to chaff me about it shamefully,\nnow that their anger and fright are gone by. Poor as I am, I would give\na hundred pounds, for the sake of the parish, to have it all cleared up.\nBut the longer it goes on, the darker it gets. You used to be famous for\nconcise abstracts. Do you remember our Thucydides? Wasn't it old Short\nthat used to put a year of the war on an oyster-shell, and you beat him\nby putting it on a thumbnail? Give us in ten lines all the theories of\nthe great Perlycrucian mystery. Ready in a moment. I'll jot them down.\nWhat's the Greek for Perlycross? Puzzle even you, I think, that would.\nNumber them, one, two, and so on. There must be a dozen by this time.\"\n\nMr. Penniloe felt some annoyance at this too jocular view of the\nsubject; but he bore in mind that his Rector was not so sadly bound up\nwith it, as his own life was. So he set down, as offering the shortest\nform, the names of those who had been charged with the crime, either by\nthe public voice, or by private whisper.\n\n1. Fox.\n\n2. Gronow.\n\n3. Gowler.\n\n4. Some other medical man of those parts--conjecture founded very often\nupon the last half-year's account.\n\n5. Lady Waldron herself.\n\n6. Some relative of hers, with or without her knowledge.\n\n\"Now I think that exhausts them,\" the Curate continued, \"and I will\ndiscuss them in that order. No. 1 is the general opinion still. I mean\nthat of the great majority, outside the parish, and throughout the\ncounty. None who knew Jemmy could conceive it, and those who know\nnothing of him will dismiss it, I suppose, when they hear of his long\nattachment to Miss Waldron.\n\n\"Nos. 2, 3, and 4, may also be dismissed, being founded in each case on\npersonal dislikes, without a _scintilla_ of evidence to back it. As\nregards probability, No. 4 would take the lead; for Gronow, and Gowler,\nare out of the question. The former has given up practice, and hates it,\nexcept for the benefit of his friends. And as for Gowler, he could have\nno earthly motive. He understood the case as well as if he had seen it;\nand his whole time is occupied with his vast London practice. But No. 4\nalso is reduced to the very verge of impossibility. There is no one at\nExeter, who would dream of such things. No country practitioner would\ndare it, even if the spirit of research could move him. And as for Bath,\nand Bristol, I have received a letter from Gowler disposing of all\npossibility there.\"\n\n\"Who suggested No. 5? That seems a strange idea. What on earth should\nLady Waldron do it for?\"\n\n\"Gowler suggested it. I tell you in the strictest confidence,\nChevithorne. Of course you will feel that. I have told no one else, and\nI should not have told you, except that I want your advice about it. You\nhave travelled in Spain. You know much of Spanish people. I reject the\ntheory altogether; though Gowler is most positive, and laughs at my\nobjections. You remember him, of course?\"\n\n\"I should think so,\" said the Rector, \"a wonderfully clever fellow, but\nnever much liked. Nobody could ever get on with him, but you; and two\nmore totally different men--however, an opinion of his is worth\nsomething. What motive could he discover for it?\"\n\n\"Religious feelings. Narrow, if you like--for we are as Catholic as they\nare--but very strong, as one could well conceive, if only they suited\nthe character. The idea would be, that the wife, unable to set aside the\nhusband's wishes openly, or unwilling to incur the odium of it, was\nsecretly resolved upon his burial elsewhere, and with the rites which\nshe considered needful.\"\n\n\"It is a most probable explanation. I wonder that it never occurred to\nyou. Gowler has hit the mark. What a clever fellow! And see how it\nexculpates the parish! I shall go back, with a great weight off my\nmind. Upon my soul, Penniloe, I am astonished that you had to go to\nLondon, to find out this _a_, _b_, _c_. If I had been over here a little\nmore often, I should have hit upon it, long ago.\"\n\n\"Chevithorne, I think that very likely,\" the Curate replied, with the\nmildness of those who let others be rushed off their legs by themselves.\n\"The theory is plausible,--accounts for everything,--fits in with the\nvery last discoveries, proves this parish, and even the English nation,\nguiltless. Nevertheless, it is utterly wrong; according at least to my\nview of human nature.\"\n\n\"Your view of human nature was always too benevolent. That was why\neverybody liked you so. But, my dear fellow, you have lived long enough\nnow, to know that it only does for Christmas-day sermons.\"\n\n\"I have not lived long enough, and hope to do so never,\" Mr. Penniloe\nanswered very quietly; but with a manner, which the other understood, of\nthe larger sight looking over hat-crowns. \"Will you tell me,\nChevithorne, upon what points you rely? And then, I will tell you what I\nthink of them.\"\n\n\"Why, if it comes to argument, what chance have I against you? You can\nput things, and I can't. But I can sell a horse, and you can buy\nit--fine self-sacrifice on your side. I go strictly upon common sense. I\nhave heard a lot of that Lady Waldron. I have had some experience of\nSpanish ladies. Good and bad, no doubt, just as English ladies are. It\nis perfectly obvious to my mind, that Lady Waldron has done all this.\"\n\n\"To my mind,\" replied Mr. Penniloe, looking stedfastly at the Rector,\n\"it is equally obvious that she has not.\"\n\n\"Upon what do you go?\" asked the Rector, rather warmly, for he prided\nhimself on his knowledge of mankind, though admitting very handsomely\nhis ignorance of books.\n\n\"I go upon my faith in womankind.\" The Curate spoke softly, as if such a\nthing were new, and truly it was not at all in fashion then. \"This woman\nloved her husband. Her grief was deep and genuine. His wishes were\nsacred to her. She is quite incapable of double-dealing. And indeed, I\nwould say, that if ever there was a straightforward simple-hearted\nwoman----\"\n\n\"If ever, if ever,\" replied Mr. Chevithorne, with a fine indulgent\nsmile. \"But upon the whole, I think well of them. Let us have a game of\ndraughts, my dear fellow, where the Queens jump over all the poor men.\"\n\n\"Kings, we call them here,\" answered Mr. Penniloe.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\n\nVAGABONDS.\n\n\nAlthough Mr. Penniloe's anxiety about the growth of Church-debt was thus\nrelieved a little, another of his troubles was by no means lightened\nthrough the visit of the Rector. That nasty suspicion, suggested by\nGowler, and heartily confirmed by Chevithorne, was a very great\ndiscomfort, and even a torment, inasmuch as he had no one to argue it\nwith. He reasoned with himself that even if the lady were a schemer, so\nheartless as to ruin a young man (who had done her no harm) that she\nmight screen herself, as well as an actress so heaven-gifted as to\nimpose on every one--both of which qualifications he warmly denied--yet\nthere was no motive, so far as he could see, strong enough to lead her\ninto such a crooked course. To the best of his belief, she was far too\nindifferent upon religious questions; he had never seen, or heard, of a\npriest at Walderscourt; and although she never came to church with the\nothers of the family, she had allowed her only daughter to be brought up\nas a Protestant. She certainly did not value our great nation, quite as\nmuch as it values itself, and in fact was rather an ardent Spaniard,\nthough herself of mixed race. But it seemed most unlikely, that either\nreligion or patriotism, or both combined, were strong enough to drive\nher into action contrary to her dead husband's wishes and to her own\ncharacter, so far as an unprejudiced man could judge it.\n\nThere remained the last theory, No. 6, as given above. To the Curate it\nseemed the more probable one, although surrounded with difficulties.\nThere might be some Spanish relative, or even one of other country,\nresolute to save the soul of Sir Thomas Waldron, without equal respect\nfor his body; and in that case it was just possible, that the whole\nthing might have been arranged, and done, without Lady Waldron's\nknowledge. But if that were so, what meant the visit of the foreigner,\nwho had tried to escape his notice, when he left the coach?\n\nBefore Mr. Penniloe could think it out--Jemmy Fox (who might have helped\nhim, by way of Nicie, upon that last point) was called away suddenly\nfrom Perlycross. His mother was obliged, in the course of nature, to\nlook upon him now as everybody's prop and comfort; because her husband\ncould not be regarded in that light any longer. And two or three things\nwere coming to pass, of family import and issue, which could not go\naright, except through Jemmy's fingers. And of these things the most\nimportant was concerning his sister Christina.\n\n\"I assure you, Jemmy, that her state of mind is most unsatisfactory,\"\nthe lady said to her son, upon their very first consultation. \"She does\nnot care for any of her usual occupations. She takes no interest in\nparish matters. She let that wicked old Margery Daw get no less than\nthree pairs of blankets, and Polly Church go without any at all--at\nleast she might, so far as Christie cared. Then you know that admirable\nHuggins' Charity--a loaf and three halfpence for every cottage\ncontaining more than nine little ones;--well, she let them pass the\nchildren from one house to another; and neither loaves nor halfpence\nheld out at all! 'I'll make it good,' she said, 'what's the odds?' or\nsomething almost as vulgar. How thankful I was, that Sir Henry did not\nhear her! 'Oh I wish he had, rayther,' she exclaimed with a toss of her\nhead. You know that extremely low slangish way of saying _rayther_ to\neverything. It does irritate me so, and she knows it. One would think\nthat instead of desiring to please as excellent a man as ever lived, her\none object was to annoy and disgust him. And she does not even confine\nherself to--to the language of good society. She has come back from\nPerlycross, with a sad quantity of Devonshirisms; and she always brings\nthem out before Sir Henry, who is, as you know, a fastidious man,\nwithout any love of jocularity. And it is such a very desirable thing. I\ndid hope it would have been all settled, before your dear father's\nbirthday.\"\n\n\"Well, mother, and so it may easily be. The only point is this--after\nall her bad behaviour, will Sir Henry come to the scratch?\"\n\n\"My dear son! My dear Jemmy, what an expression! And with reference to\nwedded life! But if I understand your meaning, he is only waiting my\npermission to propose; and I am only waiting for a favourable time. The\nsweetest tempered girl I ever saw; better even than yours, Jemmy, and\nyours has always been very fine. But now--and she has found out, or made\nup, some wretched low song, and she sings it down the stairs, or even\ncomes singing it into the room, pretending that she does not see me. All\nabout the miseries of stepmothers. Oh, she is most worrying and\naggravating! And to me, who have laboured so hard for her good!\nSometimes I fancy that she must have seen somebody. Surely, it never\ncould have been at Perlycross?\"\n\n\"I'll put a stop to all that pretty smartly\"--the doctor exclaimed, with\nfine confidence. \"But--but perhaps it would be better, mother, for me\nnot to seem to take Sir Henry's part too strongly. At any rate until\nthings come to a climax. He is coming this afternoon, you said; let him\npop the question at once; and if she dares to refuse him, then let me\nhave a turn at her. She has got a rare tongue; but I think I know\nsomething--at any rate, you know that I don't stand much nonsense.\"\n\nThey had scarcely settled their arrangements for her, when down the\nstairs came Christie, looking wonderfully pretty; but her song was not\nof equal beauty.\n\n\n     \"There was an old dog, and his name was 'Shep;'\n     Says he to his daughter--don't you ever be a Step.\"\n\n\nShe nodded to her mother very dutifully, and to her brother with a smile\nthat made him laugh; and then she went out of the front-door, almost as\nif she felt contempt for it.\n\n\"Won't do. Won't do at all;\" said Jemmy. \"She'll say 'no,' this\nafternoon. Girls never know what they are about. But better let him\nbring it to the point. And then leave it to me, mother. I understand\nher. And she knows I am not to be trifled with.\"\n\nSir Henry Haggerstone came in time for luncheon, showed no signs of\nnervousness, and got on very well with everybody. He knew something of\neverything that is likely to be talked of anywhere; and yet he had the\nknack of letting down his knowledge, as a carpet for his friends to walk\nupon. Everybody thought--\"Well, I have taught him something. He could\nnot be expected to understand that subject. But now, from his own words,\nI feel that he will. What a fool Smith is, to be bothering a man like\nSir Henry with the stuff that is _a_. _b_. _c_. to him! I wonder that he\ncould put up with it.\"\n\nBut however great Sir Henry was in powers of conversation, or even of\nauscultation, his eloquence--if there was any--fell flat, and his\naudience was brief, and the answer unmistakable.\n\n\"It can't be. It mustn't be. It shan't be, at any price.\" That last\nexpression was a bit of slang, but it happened to fit the circumstances.\n\n\"But why can it not be? Surely, Miss Fox, I may ask you to give me some\nreason for that.\"\n\nThe gentleman thought--\"What a strange girl you are!\" While the lady was\nthinking--\"What a difference there is between an artificial man and a\nnatural one!\"\n\n\"What o'clock is it, by that time-piece, if you please, Sir Henry\nHaggerstone?\"\n\n\"Half-past two, within about two minutes.\"\n\n\"Thank you; can you tell me why it isn't half-past ten? Just because it\nisn't. And so now you understand.\"\n\n\"I am sorry to say, that I do not very clearly. Probably it is very\nstupid of me. But can you not give me a little hope, Miss Fox?\"\n\n\"Yes, a great deal; and with my best wishes. There are thousands of nice\ngirls, a thousand times nicer than I ever was, who would say 'yes,' in a\nminute.\"\n\n\"But the only one, whose 'yes' I want, says 'no,' in less than half a\nminute!\"\n\n\"To be sure, she does--and means it all over; but begs to offer no end\nof thanks.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it is all for the best,\" he thought as he rode homeward slowly;\n\"she is a very sweet girl; but of late she seems to have grown so fond\nof slang expressions--all very well for a man, but not at all what I\nlike in a woman. I should have been compelled to break her of that\ntrick; and even the sweetest tempered woman hates to be corrected.\"\n\nThis gentleman would have been surprised to hear that the phrases he\ndisliked were used, because he so thoroughly disliked them. Which, to\nsay the least, was unamiable.\n\n\"All settled? Hurrah! My dear Chris, let me congratulate you,\" cried\nJemmy rushing in with a jaunty air, though he well knew what the truth\nwas.\n\n\"Amen! It is a happy thing. That golden parallelogram, all tapered and\nwell-rounded, will come to harass me no more.\"\n\n\"What a mixture of quotations! A girl alone could achieve it. A tapered\nparallelogram! But you have never been fool enough to refuse him?\"\n\n\"I have been wise enough to do so.\"\n\n\"And soon you will be wise enough to think better of it. I shall take\ngood care to let him know, that no notice is to be taken of your pretty\nlittle vagaries.\"\n\n\"Don't lose your temper, my dear Jemmy. As for taking notice of it, Sir\nHenry may be nothing very wonderful. But at any rate he is a gentleman.\"\n\n\"I am heartily glad that you have found that out. I thought nobody could\nbe a gentleman, unless he lived in a farm-house, and could do a day's\nploughing, and shear his own sheep.\"\n\n\"Yes, oh yes! If he can roll his own pills, and mix his own black\ndraughts, and stick a knife into any one.\"\n\n\"Now, it is no use trying to insult me, my dear girl. My profession is\nabove all that.\"\n\n\"What, above its own business? Oh Jemmy, Jemmy! And yet you know, you\nwere afraid sometimes of leaving it all to that little boy George.\nHowever George did the best part of it.\"\n\n\"Christie, I shall be off, because you don't know what you are talking\nof. I am sorry for any man, who gets you.\"\n\n\"Ha! That depends upon whether I like him. If I do, wouldn't I polish\nhis boots? If I don't, wouldn't I have the hair off his head?\"\n\n\"Good-bye, my dear child. You will be better, by and by.\"\n\n\"Stop,\" exclaimed Christie, who perceived that dear Jemmy preferred to\nhave it out with her, when she might be less ready; \"don't be in such a\nhurry. There is no child with the measles, which is about the worst\nhuman complaint that you can cure. Just answer me one question. Have I\never interfered, between you and Nicie Waldron?\"\n\n\"The Lord look down upon me! What an idea! As if you could ever be so\nabsurd!\"\n\n\"The Lord looks down upon me, also, Jemmy;\" said Christie, passing into\na different mood. \"And He gives me the right to see to my own happiness,\nwithout consulting you; any more than you do me.\"\n\nThe Doctor made off, without another word; for he was not a quarrelsome\nfellow; especially when he felt that he would get the worst of it.\n\n\"Let her alone a bit;\" he told his mother. \"She has been so much used to\nhave her own way, that she expects to have it always. It will require a\nlittle judgment, and careful handling, to bring her out of her\nabsurdities. You must not expect her to have the sense a man has. And\nshe has got an idea that she is so clever; which makes her confoundedly\nobstinate. If you had heard how insolent she was to me, you would have\nbeen angry with her. But she cannot vex me with her childish little\ntalk. I shall go for a thirty mile ride, dear mother, to get a little\nfresh air after all that. Don't expect me back to dinner. Be distant\nwith her, and let her see that you are grieved; but give her no chance\nof arguing--if indeed she calls such stuff argument.\"\n\nIn a few minutes he was on the back of _Perle_--as he called the kindly\nand free-going little mare, who had brought him again from\nPerlycross--and trotting briskly towards the long curve of highlands,\nwhich form the western bulwark of the Mendip Hills. The weather had been\nvery mild and rather stormy, ever since the Christmas frost broke up,\nand now in the first week of the year, the air was quite gentle and\npleasant. But the roads were heavy and very soft, as they always are in\na thaw; and a great deal of water was out in the meadows, and even in\nthe ditches alongside of the lanes.\n\nIn a puzzle of country roads and commons, further from home than his\nusual track, and very poorly furnished with guide-posts, Fox rode on\nwithout asking whither; caring only for the exercise and air, and\nabsorbed in thought about the present state of things, both at\nPerlycross and Foxden. To his quick perception and medical knowledge it\nwas clear that his father's strength was failing, gradually, but without\nrecall. And one of the very few things that can be done by medical\nknowledge is that it can tell us (when it likes) that it is helpless.\n\nNow Jemmy was fond of his father, although there had been many breezes\nbetween them; and as nature will have it, he loved him a hundredfold,\nnow that he was sure to lose him. Moreover the change in his own\nposition, which must ensue upon his father's death, was entirely against\nhis liking. What he liked was simplicity, plain living and plain\nspeaking, with enough of this world's goods to help a friend in trouble,\nor a poor man in distress; but not enough to put one in a fright about\nthe responsibility, that turns the gold to lead. But now, if he should\nbe compelled to take his father's place at Foxden, as a landowner and a\nwealthy man, he must give up the practice of his beloved art, he must\ngive up the active and changeful life, the free and easy manners, and\nthe game with Bill and Dick; and assume the slow dignity and stiff\nimportance, the consciousness of being an example and a law, and all the\nother briars and blackthorns in the paradise of wealth and station. Yet\neven while he sighed at the coming transformation, it never occurred to\nhim that his sister was endowed with tastes no less simple than his own,\nand was not compelled by duty to forego them.\n\nOccupied thus, and riding loose-reined without knowing or caring\nwhither, he turned the corner of a high-banked lane, and came upon a\nsight which astonished him. The deep lane ended with a hunting-gate,\nleading to an open track across a level pasture, upon which the low sun\ncast long shadows of the rider's hat, and shoulders, and elbow lifted to\nunhasp the gate. Turning in the saddle he beheld a grand and fiery\nsunset, such as in mild weather often closes a winter but not wintry\nday.\n\nA long cloud-bank, straight and level at the base, but arched and pulpy\nin its upper part, embosomed and turned into a deep red glow the yellow\nflush of the departing sun. Below this great volume of vapoury fire,\nwere long thin streaks of carmine, pencilled very delicately on a\nbackground of limpid hyaline. It was not the beauty of the sky however,\nnor the splendour, nor the subtlety, that made the young man stop and\ngaze. Fine sunsets he had seen by the hundred, and looked at them, if\nthere was time to spare; but what he had never seen before was the\ngrandeur of the earth's reply.\n\nOn the opposite side of the level land, a furlong or so in front of him,\narose the great breastwork to leagues of plain; first a steep pitch of\nshale and shingle, channelled with storm-lines, and studded with gorse;\nand then, from its crest, a tall crag towering, straight and smooth as a\ncastle-wall. The rugged pediment was dark and dim, and streaked with\nsombre shadows; but the bastion cliff above it mantled with a deep red\nglow, as if colour had its echo, in answer to the rich suffusion of that\nsunset cloud. Even the ivy, and other creepers, on its kindled face\nshone forth, like chaplets thrown upon a shield of ruddy gold. And all\nthe environed air was thrilling with the pulses of red light.\n\nFox was smitten with rare delight--for he was an observant fellow--and\neven _Perle's_ bright eyes expanded, as if they had never seen such a\nnoble vision. \"I'll be up there before it is gone,\" cried Jemmy, like a\nboy in full chase of a rainbow; \"the view from that crag must be\nglorious.\"\n\nAt the foot of the hill stood a queer little hostel, called the _Smoking\nLimekiln_; and there he led his mare into the stable, ordered some bread\nand cheese for half an hour later, and made off at speed for the steep\nascent. Active as he was, and sound of foot, he found it a slippery and\nawkward climb, on account of the sliding shingle; but after a sharp bout\nof leaping and scrambling he stood at the base of the vertical rock, and\nlooked back over the lowlands.\n\nThe beauty of colour was vanishing now, and the glory of the clouds\ngrown sombre, for the sun had sunk into a pale gray bed; but the view\nwas vast and striking. The fairest and richest of English land, the\nbroad expanse of the western plains for leagues and leagues rolled\nbefore him, deepening beneath the approach of night, and shining with\nveins of silver, where three flooded rivers wound their way. Afar\ntowards the north, a faint gleam showed the hovering of light, above the\nSevern sea; whence slender clues of fog began to steal, like snakes, up\nthe watercourses, and the marshy inlets. Before there was time to watch\nthem far, the veil of dusk fell over them, and things unwatched stood\nforth, and took a prominence unaccountable, according to the laws of\ntwilight, arbitrary and mysterious.\n\nFox felt that the view had repaid his toil, and set his face to go down\nagain, with a tendency towards bread and cheese; but his very first step\ncaused such a slide of shingle and loose ballast, that he would have\nbeen lucky to escape with a broken bone, had he followed it. Thereupon\ninstead of descending there, he thought it wiser to keep along the ledge\nat the foot of the precipice, and search for a safer track down the\nhill. None however presented itself, until he had turned the corner of\nthe limestone crag, and reached its southern side, where the descent\nbecame less abrupt and stony.\n\nHere he was stepping sideways down, for the pitch was still sharp and\ndangerous, and the daylight failing in the blinks of hills, when he\nheard a loud shout--\"Jemmy! Jemmy!\"--which seemed to spring out of the\nearth at his feet. In the start of surprise he had shaped his lips for\nthe answering halloa, when good luck more than discretion saved him; for\nboth his feet slipped, and his breath was caught. By a quick turn he\nrecovered balance; but the check had given him time to think, and spying\na stubby cornel-bush, he came to a halt behind it, and looked through\nthe branches cautiously.\n\nSome twenty yards further down the hill, he saw a big man come striding\nforth from the bowels of the earth--as it seemed at first--and then\nstanding with his back turned, and the haze beyond enlarging him. And\nthen again, that mighty shout rang up the steep and down the\nvalley--\"Jemmy, Jemmy, come back, I tell thee, or I'l let thee know\nwhat's what!\"\n\nFox kept close, and crouched in his bush, for he never had seen such a\nman till now, unless it were in a caravan; and a shudder ran through\nhim, as it came home that his friend down there could with one hand\nrob, throttle, and throw him down a mining shaft. This made him keep a\nvery sharp look-out, and have one foot ready for the lightest of\nleg-bail.\n\nPresently a man of moderate stature, who could have walked under the\nother's arm, came panting and grumbling back again from a bushy track\nleading downwards. He flung something on the ground and asked--\n\n\"What be up now; to vetch me back up-hill for? Harvey, there bain't no\nsense in 'e. Maight every bit as well a' had it out, over a half pint of\nbeer.\"\n\n\"Sit you there, Jem,\" replied the other, pressing him down on a ledge of\nstone with the weight of one thumb on his shoulder. Then he sat himself\ndown on a higher ridge, and pulled out a pipe, with a sigh as loud as\nthe bellows of a forge could compass; and then slowly spread upon the\ndome of his knee a patch of German punk, and struck sparks into it.\n\nThere was just light enough for Fox to see that the place where they sat\nwas at the mouth of a mining shaft, or sloping adit; over the rough\nstone crown of which, standing as he did upon a higher level, he could\ndescry their heads and shoulders, and the big man's fingers as he moved\nthem round his pipe. Presently a whiff of coarse brown smoke came\nfloating uphill to the Doctor's nostrils; and his blood ran cold, as he\nbegan to fear that this great Harvey must be the Harvey Tremlett, of\nwhom he had heard from Mr. Penniloe.\n\n\"Made up my maind I have. Can't stand this no longer;\" said the big man,\nwith the heavy drawl, which nature has inflicted upon very heavy men.\n\"Can't get no more for a long day's work, than a hop o' my thumb like\nyou does.\"\n\n\"And good raison why, mate. Do 'e ever do a hard day's work?\" Fox could\nhave sworn that the smaller throat gave utterance to the larger share of\ntruth. \"What be the vally of big arms and legs, when a chap dothn't care\nto make use of 'un?\"\n\nBut the big man was not controversial. Giants are generally above that\nweakness. He gave a long puff, and confined himself to facts.\n\n\"Got my money: and d--d little it is. And now I means to hook it. You\ncan hang on, if you be vule enough.\"\n\n\"What an old Turk it is!\" Jem replied reproachfully. \"Did ever you know\nme throw you over, Harvey? Who is it brings you all the luck? Tell 'e\nwhat--let's go back to Clampits. What a bit o' luck that loudering wor!\"\n\n\"Hor, hor, hor!\" the big man roared. \"A purty lot they be to Perlycrass!\nTo take Jemmy Kettel for a gentleman! And a doctor too! Oh Lord! Oh\nLord! Doctor Jemmy Vox Kettel! Licensed to deal in zalts and zenna,\npowders, pills, and bolusses. Oh Jemmy, Jemmy, my eye, my eye!\"\n\n\"Could do it, I'll be bound, as well as he doth. A vaine doctor, to dig\nup the Squire of the parish, and do it wrong way too, they zay of 'un!\nVaine doctor, wasn't 'un? Oh Lord! Oh Lord!\"\n\nAs these two rovers combined in a hearty roar of mirth at his expense,\nDr. Jemmy Fox, instead of being grateful for a purely impartial opinion,\ngave way to ill feeling, and stamped one foot in passionate\nremonstrance. Too late he perceived that this movement of his had\nstarted a pebble below the cornel-bush, and sent it rolling down the\nsteep. Away went the pebble with increasing skips, and striking the\ncrown of the pit-mouth flew just over the heads of the uncouth jokers.\n\n\"Halloa, Jemmy! Anybody up there? Just you goo, and look, my boy.\"\n\nFox shrunk into himself, as he heard those words in a quicker roar\ncoming up to him. If they should discover him, his only chance would be\nto bound down the hill, reckless of neck, and desperate of accident. But\nthe light of the sky at the top of the hill was blocked by the rampart\nof rock, and so there was nothing for him to be marked upon.\n\n\"Nort but a badger, or a coney there, I reckon,\" Jem Kettel said, after\npeering up the steep; and just then a rabbit of fast style of life\nwhisked by; \"Goo on, Harvey. You han't offered me no 'bacco!\"\n\n\"You tak' and vinish 'un;\" said the lofty-minded giant, poking his pipe\nbetween the other fellow's teeth. \"And now you give opinion; if the Lord\nhath gived thee any.\"\n\n\"Well, I be up for bunkum, every bit so much as you be. But where shall\nus be off to? That's the p'int of zettlement. Clampits, I say. Roaring\nfun there, and the gim'-keepers aveared of 'e.\"\n\n\"Darsn't goo there yet, I tell 'e. Last thing old moother did was to\nsend me word, Passon to Perlycrass had got the tip on me. Don't want no\nbother with them blessed Beaks again.\"\n\n\"Wonder you didn't goo and twist the Passon's neck.\" The faithful mate\nlooked up at him, as if the captain had failed of his duty,\nunaccountably.\n\n\"Wouldn't touch a hair of that man's head, if it wor here atwixt my two\nknees.\" Harvey Tremlett brought his fist down on his thigh, with a smack\nthat made the stones ring round him. \"Tell 'e why, Jem Kettel. He have\ntook my little Zip along of his own chiller, and a' maneth to make a\nlady on her. And a lady the little wench hath a right to be--just you\nsay the contrairy--if hanncient vam'ley, and all that, have right to\ncount. Us Tremletts was here, long afore they Waldrons.\"\n\nThe smaller man appeared afraid to speak. He knew the weak point of the\nbig man perhaps, and that silence oils all such bearings.\n\n\"Tull 'e what, Jemmy,\" said the other coming round, after stripping his\nfriend's mouth of his proper pipe; \"us'll go up country--shoulder packs\nand be off, soon as ever the moon be up. Like to see any man stop me, I\nwould.\"\n\nHe stood up, with the power of his mighty size upon him; a man who\nseemed fit to stop an avalanche, and able to give as much trouble about\nstopping him.\n\n\"All right, I be your man;\" replied the other, speaking as if he were\nquite as big, and upon the whole more important. \"Bristol fust; and then\nLunnon, if so plaise 'e. Always a bit of louderin' there. But that\nremindeth me of Perlycrass. Us be bound to be back by fair-time, you\nknow. Can't afford to miss old Timberlegs.\"\n\n\"Time enow for that;\" Harvey Tremlett answered. \"Zix or zeven weeks yet\nto Perlycrass fair. What time wor it as old Timberlegs app'inted?\"\n\n\"Ten o'clock at naight, by Churchyard wall. Reckon the old man hath\nanother job of louderin' handy. What a spree that wor, and none a rap\nthe wiser! Come along, Harvey, let's have a pint at the _Kiln_, to drink\ngood luck to this here new start.\"\n\nThe big man took his hat off, while the other jumped nimbly on a stump\nand flung over his head the straps of both their bundles; and then with\na few more leisurely and peaceful oaths they quitted their stony\nplatform, and began to descend the winding path, from which Jem Kettel\nhad been recalled.\n\nFox was content for a minute or two with peeping warily after them,\nwhile his whole frame tingled with excitement, wrath, and horror,\nsucceeded by a burning joy at the knowledge thus vouchsafed to him, by a\nhigher power than fortune. As soon as he felt certain that they could\nnot see him, even if they looked back again, he slipped from his\nlurking-place, and at some risk of limb set off in a straighter course\nthan theirs for the Public house in the valley, where a feeble light was\ntwinkling. From time to time he could hear the two rovers laughing at\ntheir leisure, probably with fine enjoyment of very bad jokes at his\nexpense. But he set his teeth, and made more speed, and keeping his\ndistance from them, easily arrived first at the Inn, where he found his\nbread and cheese set forth, in a little private parlour having fair view\nof the Bar.\n\nThis suited him well, for his object was to obtain so clear a sight of\nthem, that no change of dress or disguise should cast any doubt upon\ntheir identity; and he felt sure that they were wending hither to drink\ngood speed to their enterprise. There was not much fear of their\nrecognising him, even if his face were known to them, which he did not\nthink at all likely. But he provided against any such mishap, by paying\nhis bill beforehand, and placing his candle so that his face was in the\ndark. Then he fell to and enjoyed his bread and cheese; for the ride and\nthe peril had produced fine relish, and a genuine Cheddar--now sighed\nfor so vainly--did justice to its nativity. He also enjoyed, being now\nin safety, the sweet sense of turning the tables upon his wanton and\nhateful deriders.\n\nFor sure enough, while his mouth was full, and the froth on his ale was\nwinking at him, in came those two scoffing fellows, followed by a dozen\nother miners. It appeared to be pay-night, and generous men were\nshedding sixpences on one another; but Fox saw enough to convince him\nthat the rest fought shy of his two acquaintances.\n\nWhen he saw this, a wild idea occurred to him for a moment--was it not\npossible to arrest that pair, with the aid of their brother miners? But\na little consideration showed the folly of such a project. He had no\nwarrant, no witness, no ally, and he was wholly unknown in that\nneighbourhood. And even if the miners should believe his tale, would\nthey combine, to lay hands on brother workmen, and hand them over to the\nmercies of the law? Even if they would, it was doubtful that they could,\nsturdy fellows though they were.\n\nBut the young man was so loth to let these two vagabonds get away, that\nhis next idea was to bribe somebody to follow them, and keep them in\nview until he should come in chase, armed with the needful warrant, and\nsupported by stout _posse comitatus_. He studied the faces of his\nfriends at the Bar, to judge whether any were fitted for the job. Alas,\namong all those rough and honest features, there was not a spark of\ncraft, nor a flash of swift intelligence. If one of them were put to\nwatch another, the first thing he would do would be to go and tell him\nof it.\n\nAnd what Justice of the Peace would issue warrant upon a stranger's\ndeposition of hearsays? Much against his will, Jemmy Fox perceived that\nthere was nothing for it, but to give these two rogues a wide berth for\nthe present, keep his own counsel most jealously, and be ready to meet\nthem at Perlycross fair. And even so, on his long homeward ride, he\nthought that the prospect was brightening in the west; and that he with\nhis name cleared might come forward, and assert his love for the gentle\nNicie.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX.\n\nTWO PUZZLES.\n\n\n\"Then if I understand aright, Lady Waldron, you wish me to drop all\nfurther efforts for the detection of those miscreants? And that too at\nthe very moment, when we had some reason to hope that we should at last\nsucceed. And all the outlay, which is no trifle, will have been simply\nthrown away! This course is so extraordinary, that you will not think me\ninquisitive, if I beg you to explain it.\"\n\nMr. Webber, the lawyer, was knitting his forehead, and speaking in a\ntone of some annoyance, and much doubt, as to the correctness of his own\nreluctant inference. Meanwhile the Spanish lady was glancing at him with\nsome dismay, and then at Mr. Penniloe, who was also present, for the\nmorning's discussion had been of business matters.\n\n\"No, I doubt very much if you quite comprehend,\" she answered, with Mr.\nPenniloe's calm eyes fixed upon her. \"I did not propose to speak\nentirely like that. What I was desirous of describing to you is, that to\nme it is less of eagerness to be going on with so much haste, until the\nreturn of my dear son. He for instance will direct things, and with his\ngreat--great command of the mind, will make the proceedings to succeed,\nif it should prove possible for the human mind to do it. And there is no\none in this region, that can refuse him anything.\"\n\nMr. Penniloe saw that she spoke with some misgivings, and shifted her\ngaze from himself to the lawyer and back again, with more of enquiry,\nand less of dictation, than her usual tone conveyed.\n\n\"The matter is entirely one for your ladyship's own decision,\" replied\nMr. Webber, beginning to fold up the papers he had submitted. \"Mr.\nPenniloe has left that to us, as was correct, inasmuch as it does not\nconcern the trust. I will stop all enquiries at once, upon receiving\nyour instructions to that effect.\"\n\n\"But--but I think you do not well comprehend. Perhaps I could more\nclearly place it with the use of my own tongue. It is nothing more than\nthis. I wish that my dear son should not give up his appointment as\nOfficer, and come back to this country, for altogether nothing. I wish\nthat he should have the delight of thinking that--that it shall be of\nhis own procuration, to unfold this mysterious case. Yes, that is\nit--that is all that I wish--to let things wait a little, until my son\ncomes.\"\n\nIf either of her listeners had been very keen, or endowed with the\nterrier nose of suspicion, he would have observed perhaps that the lady\nhad found some relief from an afterthought, and was now repeating it as\na happy hit. But Mr. Penniloe was too large, and Mr. Webber too rough of\nmind--in spite of legal training--to pry into a lady's little turns of\nthought.\n\n\"Very well, madam,\" said the lawyer, rising, \"that finishes our business\nfor to-day, I think. But I beg to congratulate you on your son's return.\nI cannot call to mind that I have heard of it before. Every one will be\ndelighted to see him. Even in his father's time, everybody was full of\nhim. When may we hope to see him, Lady Waldron?\"\n\n\"Before very long, I have reason for good hope,\" the lady replied, with\na smile restoring much of the beauty of her careworn face. \"I have not\nheard the day yet; but I know that he will come. He has to obtain\npermission from all the proper authorities, of course. And that is like\nyour very long and very costful processes of the Great British law, Mr.\nWebber. But now I will entreat of you to excuse me any more. I have\ngiven very long attention. Mr. Webber, will you then oblige me by being\nthe host to Mr. Penniloe? The refreshment is in the approximate room.\"\n\n\"Devilish fine woman,\" Mr. Webber whispered, as her ladyship sailed\naway. \"Wonderfully clever too! How she does her w's--I don't know much\nabout them, but I always understood, that there never was any one born\nout of England, who could make head or tail of his w's. Why, she speaks\nEnglish quite like a native! But I see you are looking at me. Shocking\nmanners, I confess, to swear in the presence of a parson, sir; though\nplenty of them do it--ha, ha, ha!--in their own absence, I suppose.\"\n\n\"It is not my presence, Mr. Webber. That makes it neither better nor\nworse. But the presence of God is everywhere.\"\n\n\"To be sure! So it is. Come into the next room. Her ladyship said we\nshould find something there. I suppose we shan't see Missy though,\" said\nthe lawyer, as he led the Parson to the luncheon-table. \"She fights very\nshy of your humble servant now. Girls never forgive that sort of thing.\nI don't often make such a mistake though, do I? And it was my son\nWaldron's fault altogether. Waldron is a sharp fellow, but not like me.\nCan't see very far into a milestone. Pity to stop the case, before we\ncleared Fox. I don't understand this new turn though. A straw shows the\nway the wind blows. Something behind the scenes, Mr. Penniloe. More\nthere than meets the eye. Is it true that old Fox is dropping off the\nhooks?\"\n\n\"If you mean to ask me, Mr. Webber, what I have heard about his state of\nhealth, I fear that there is little hope of his recovery. Dr. Fox\nreturns to-morrow, as you may have heard through--through your especial\nagents. You know what my opinion is of that proceeding on your part.\"\n\n\"Yes, you spoke out pretty plainly. And, by George, you were right, sir!\nAs fine a property as any in the county. I had no idea it was half as\nmuch. Why, bless my heart sir, Jemmy Fox will be worth his \u00c2\u00a38000 a year,\nthey tell me!\"\n\n\"I am glad that his worth,\" Mr. Penniloe said quietly, \"is sufficient\n_per annum_ to relieve him from your very dark suspicion.\"\n\n\"Got me there!\" replied Webber, with a laugh. \"Ah, you parsons always\nbeat the lawyers. Bury us, don't you? If you find no other way. But we\nget the last fee after all. Probate, sir, Probate is an expensive thing.\nWell, I must be off. I see my gig is ready. If you can make my peace\nwith Jemmy Fox, say a word for me. After all it looked uncommonly black,\nyou know. And young men should be forgiving.\"\n\nScarcely had his loud steps ceased to ring, when a very light pit-a-pat\nsucceeded, and Mr. Penniloe found himself in far more interesting\ncompany. Nicie came softly, and put back her hair, and offered her\nlovely white forehead to be kissed, and sat down with a smile that\nbegged pardon for a sigh.\n\n\"Oh, Uncle Penniloe, I am so glad! I thought I should never have a talk\nwith you again. My fortune has been so frightful lately. Everything\nagainst me, the same as it has been with this dear little soul here.\"\n\nShe pointed to _Jess_, the wounded one, who trotted in cheerfully upon\nthree legs, with the other strapped up in a white silk pouch. The little\ndoggie wagged her tail, and looked up at the Clergyman, with her large\neyes full of soft gratitude and love; as by that reflex action, which a\ndog's eyes have without moving, they took in--and told their intense\ndelight in--that vigilant nurse, and sweet comrade, Nicie.\n\n\"Oh, she is so proud;\" Miss Waldron said, looking twice as proud\nherself; \"this is the first time that she has had the privilege of going\nupon three legs, without anybody's hand; and she does think so much of\nherself! _Jess_, go and show Uncle Penniloe what she can do, now her\nhealth is coming back. _Jess_, go and cut a little caper--very steadily,\nyou know, for fear of going twisty; and keep her tail up, all the time!\nNow _Jess_ come, and have a pretty kiss; because she has earned it\nsplendidly.\"\n\n\"She takes my breath away, because she is so good;\" continued Nicie,\nleaning over her. \"I have studied her character for six weeks now, and\nthere is not a flaw to be found in it, unless it is a noble sort of\njealousy. _Pixie_\"--here _Jess_ uttered a sharp small growl, and showed\na few teeth as good as ever--\"I must not mention his name again, because\nit won't do to excite her; but he is out in the cold altogether, because\nhe has never shown any heroism. No, no, he shan't come, _Jess_. He is\nlocked up, for want of chivalry. Oh, Uncle Penniloe, there is one\nquestion I have long been wanting to ask you. Do you think it possible\nfor even God to forgive the man--the brute, I mean--who slashed this\nlittle dear like that, for being so loving, and so true?\"\n\n\"My dear child,\" Mr. Penniloe replied; \"I have just been saying to\nmyself, how like your dear father you are growing--in goodness and\nkindness of face, I mean. But when you look like that, the resemblance\nis quite lost. I should never have thought you capable of such a\nferocious aspect.\"\n\n\"Ah, that is because you don't know what I can do.\" But as she spoke,\nher arched brows were relaxing, and her flashing eyes filled with their\nusual soft gleam. \"You forget that I am half a Spaniard still, or at any\nrate a quarter one, and therefore I can be very terrible sometimes. Ah,\nyou should have seen me the other day. I let somebody know who I am. He\nthought perhaps that butter wouldn't melt in my mouth. Did not I\nastonish him, the impertinent low wretch?\"\n\n\"Why, Nicie, this is not at all like you! I always quote you as a model\nof sweet temper. Who can have aroused your angry passions thus?\"\n\n\"Oh, never mind. I should like to tell you, and I want to tell you very\nmuch. But I am not permitted, though I don't know why. My mother has\nbegged me particularly not to speak of that man who came--gentleman, I\nsuppose he would call himself--but there, I am telling you all about\nhim! And mother is so different, and so much more humble now. If she\nwere still as unfair as she was, I should not be so particular. But she\nseems to be so sad, and so mysterious now, without accusing any one. And\nso I will not say a word against her orders. You would not wish it,\nUncle Penniloe, I am sure.\"\n\n\"Certainly not, my dear. I will not ask another question. I have noticed\nthat your mother is quite different myself. I hope she is not falling\ninto really bad health.\"\n\n\"No, I don't think that. But into frightfully low spirits. We have\nenough to account for that, haven't we, Uncle Penniloe? To think of my\ndear father, all this time! What can I do? I am so wretchedly helpless.\nI try to trust in God, and to say to myself--'What does the earthly part\nmatter, after all? When the soul is with the Lord, or only waiting for\nHis time, and perhaps rewarded all the better--because--because of\nwicked treatment here.' But oh, it won't do, Uncle Penniloe, it won't,\nwhen I think how noble and how good he was, and to be treated in that\nway! And then I fall away, and cry, and sob, and there comes such a\npain--such a pain in my heart, that I have no breath left, and can only\nlie down, and pray that God would take me to my father. Is it wicked? I\nsuppose it is. But how am I to help it?\"\n\n\"No, my dear, it is not wicked to give way sometimes.\" The Parson's\nvoice was tremulous, at sight of her distress, and remembrance of his\nown, not so very long ago. \"Sorrow is sent to all of us, and doubtless\nfor our good; and if we did not feel it, how could we be at all improved\nby it? But you have borne it well, my child; and so has your good\nmother, considering how the first sad blow has been doubled and\nprolonged so strangely. But now it will be better for you, ever so much\nbetter, Nicie, with your dear brother home again.\"\n\n\"But when will that be? Perhaps not for years. We do not even know where\nhe is. They were not likely to stay long in Malta. He may be at the Cape\nof Good Hope by this time, if the ship has had long enough to get there.\nEverything seems to be so much against us.\"\n\n\"Are you sure that you are right, my dear?\" Mr. Penniloe asked with no\nlittle surprise. \"From what your mother said just now, I hoped that I\nshould see my old pupil very soon.\"\n\n\"I am afraid not, Uncle Penniloe. My dear mother seems to confuse things\na little, or not quite understand them. Through her late illness, no\ndoubt it is. We have not had a word from Tom, since that letter, which\nhad such a wonderful effect, as I told you, when you were gone to\nLondon. And then, if you remember, he had no idea how long they were to\nbe at Valetta. And he said nothing about their future movements very\nclearly. So full of his duties, no doubt, that he had no time to write\nlong particulars. Even now he may never have heard of--of what has\nhappened, and our sad condition. They may have been at sea, ever since\nhe wrote. Soldiers can never tell where they may have to be.\"\n\n\"That has always been so, and is a part of discipline;\" the Parson was\nthinking of the Centurion and his men. \"But even if your letter should\nhave gone astray, they must have seen some English newspapers, I should\nthink.\"\n\n\"Tom is very clever, as you know, Uncle Penniloe; but he never reads a\nword, when he can help it. And besides that, it is only fair to\nremember that he is under Government. And the Government never neglects\nan opportunity of turning right into left, and the rest upside down. If\nall the baggage intended for their draft, was sent to the West Indies,\nbecause they were ordered to the East, it ought to follow that their\nletters would go too. But the worst of it is that one cannot be sure\nthey will stick to a mistake, after making it.\"\n\n\"It is most probable that they would; especially if it were pointed out\nto them. Your dear father told me that they never forgive anybody for\ncorrecting them. But how then could your mother feel so sure about Tom's\ncoming home almost immediately?\"\n\n\"It puzzles me, until I have time to think;\" answered Nicie, looking\ndown. \"She has never said a word to me about it, beyond praying and\nhoping for Tom to come home. Oh, I know, or at least I can guess, how!\nShe may have had a dream--she believes firmly in her dreams, and she has\nnot had time to tell me yet.\"\n\nMr. Penniloe had no right to seek further, and no inclination so to do.\nThe meanest, mangiest, and most sneaking understrapper of that recent\naddition to our liberal institutions--the \"Private Enquiry Firm\"--could\nnever have suspected Nicie Waldron, after looking at her, of any of\nthose subterfuges, which he (like a slack-skin'd worm) wriggles into.\nBut on the other hand who could suppose that Lady Waldron would\nendeavour to mislead her own man of business by a trumpery deceit? And\nyet who was that strange visitor, of whom her daughter was not allowed\nto speak?\n\nUnable to understand these things, the curate shortly took his leave,\nbeing resolved, like a wise man, to think as little as he could about\nthem, until Time--that mighty locksmith, at whom even Love rarely wins\nthe latest laugh--should bring his skeleton key to bear on the wards of\nthis enigma.\n\nWhat else can a busy man do, when puzzled even by his own affairs? And\nhow much more must it be so, in the business of other persons, which he\ndoubts his right to meddle with? Perhaps it would have been difficult to\nfind any male member of our race more deeply moved by the haps and\nmishaps of his fellow-creatures than this Parson of Perlycross; and yet\nhe could take a rosier view for most of them than they took for\nthemselves. So when he left the grounds of Walderscourt, he buttoned up\nhis Spencer, and stepped out bravely, swinging his stick vigorously, and\ntrusting in the Lord.\n\n\"What did 'e hat me vor, like that?\" cried a voice of complaint from a\nbrambled ditch, outside a thick copse known as Puddicombe Wood. Mr.\nPenniloe had not got his glasses on, and was grieved to feel rather than\nto see, although he was at the right end of his stick, that he had\nbrought it down (with strong emphasis of a passage in his coming sermon)\non the head of a croucher in that tangled ditch.\n\n\"Oh I beg your pardon! I am so sorry. I had not the least idea there was\nanybody there. I was thinking of the Sower, and the cares that choke the\nseed. But get up, and let me see what I have done. What made you hide\nyourself down there? I am not the gamekeeper. Why, it is Sam Speccotty!\nPoaching again, I am afraid, Sam. But I hope I have not hurt you--so\nvery much.\"\n\n\"Bruk' my head in two. That's what you have done, Passon. Oh you can't\ngoo to tell on me, after hatting me on the brains with clubstick! Ooh,\nooh, ooh! I be gooing to die, I be.\"\n\n\"Speccotty, no lies, and no shamming!\" Mr. Penniloe put on his\nspectacles, for he knew his customer well enough,--a notorious poacher,\nbut very seldom punished, because he was considered \"a natural.\" \"This\nis no clubstick, but a light walking-stick; and between it and your head\nthere was a thick briar, as well as this vast mop of hair. Let me see\nwhat you have got under that tree-root.\"\n\nSam had been vainly endeavouring to lead his Minister away from his own\nlittle buried napkin, or rather sack of hidden treasure. \"Turn it out;\"\ncommanded the Parson, surprised at his own austerity.\n\n\"A brace of cock-pheasants, a couple of woodcocks, two couple of\nrabbits, and a leash of hares! Oh, Sam, Sam! What have you done?\nSpeccotty, I am ashamed of you.\"\n\n\"Bain't no oother chap within ten maile,\" said Speccotty, regarding the\nsubject from a different point of view; \"as could a' dooed that, since\ndree o'clock this marnin'; now Passon do 'e know of wan?\"\n\n\"I am happy to say that I do not; neither do I wish for his\nacquaintance. Give up your gun, Sam. Even if I let you off, I insist\nupon your tools; as well as all your plunder.\"\n\n\"Han't a got no goon,\" replied the poacher, looking slyly at the Parson,\nthrough the rough shock of his hair. \"Never vired a goon, for none on\n'un. Knows how to vang 'un, wi'out thiccy.\"\n\n\"I can well believe that.\" Mr. Penniloe knew not a little of poachers,\nfrom his boyish days, and was not without that secret vein of sympathy\nfor them, which every sportsman has, so long as they elude and do not\ndefy the law. \"But I must consider what I shall do. Send all this to my\nhouse to-night, that I may return it to the proper owners. Unless you do\nthat, you will be locked up to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Oh Passon, you might let me have the Roberts. To make a few broth for\nmy old moother.\"\n\n\"Not a hair, nor a feather shall you keep. Your mother shall have some\nhonest broth--but none of your stolen rabbits, Speccotty. You take it so\nlightly, that I fear you must be punished.\"\n\n\"Oh don't 'e give me up, sir. Oh, my poor head do go round so! Don't 'e\ngive me up, for God's sake, Passon. Two or dree things I can tell 'e, as\n'e 'd give the buttons off thy coat to know on. Do 'e mind when the\nDevil wor seen on Hagdon Hill, the day avore the good lady varled all\ndown the Harseshoe?\"\n\n\"I do remember hearing some foolish story, Sam, and silly people being\nfrightened by some strange appearances, very easily explained, no\ndoubt.\"\n\n\"You volk, as don't zee things, can make 'un any colour to your own\nliking. But I tell 'e old Nick gooed into the body of a girt wild cat up\nthere; and to this zide of valley, her be toorned to a black dog. Zayeth\nso in the Baible, don't 'un?\"\n\n\"I cannot recall any passage, Sam, to that effect; though I am often\nsurprised by the knowledge of those who use Holy Scripture for argument,\nmuch more freely than for guidance. And I fear that is the case with\nyou.\"\n\n\"Whuther a' dooed it, or whuther a' did not, I be the ekal of 'un, that\nI be. When her coom to me, a'gapin' and a yawnin', I up wi' bill-hook,\nand I gie'd 'un zummat. If 'tis gone back to hell a' harth, a' wun't\ncoom out again, I reckon, wi'out Sam Speccotty's mark on 'un. 'Twill\nzave 'e a lot of sarmons, Passon. Her 'ont want no more knockin' on the\nhead, this zide of Yester, to my reckoning. Hor! Passon be gone a'ready;\na' don't want to hear of that. Taketh of his trade away. Ah, I could\ntell 'un zomethin', if a' wadn't such a softie.\"\n\nMr. Penniloe had hastened on, and no longer swung his holly-stick; not\nthrough fear of knocking any more skulking poachers on the head, but\nfrom the sadness which always fell upon him, at thought of the dark and\ndeadly blow the Lord had been pleased to inflict on him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX.\n\nFRANKLY SPEAKING.\n\n\nSupposing a man to be engaged--as he often must be even now, when the\ngeneral boast of all things is, that they have done themselves by\nmachinery--in the useful and interesting work of sinking a well, by his\nown stroke and scoop; and supposing that, when he is up to his hips, and\nhas not got a dry thread upon him, but reeks and drips, like a sprawling\njelly-fish--at such a time there should drop upon him half a teaspoonful\nof water from the bucket he has been sending up--surely one might expect\nthat man to accept with a smile that little dribble, even if he\nperceives it.\n\nAlas, he does nothing of the kind! He swears, and jumps, as if he were\nin a shower-bath of vitriol, then he shouts for the ladder, drags his\ndrenched legs up, and ascends for the purpose of thrashing his mate, who\nhas dared to let a drop slip down on him. Such is the case; and no\nratepayer who has had to delve for his own water (after being robbed by\nsewage-works) will fail to perceive the force of it.\n\nEven so (if it be lawful to compare small things with great), even so it\nhas been, and must be for ever, with a young man over head and ears in\nlove, and digging in the depths of his own green gault. He throws back\nhis head, and he shovels for his life; he scorns the poor fellows who\nare looking down upon him; and he sends up bucketfuls of his own\nspooning, perhaps in the form of gravelly verse. The more he gets\nwaterlogged the deeper is his glow, and the bowels of the earth are as\ngoldbeaters' skin to him. But let anybody cast cold water, though it be\nbut a drop, on his fervid frozen loins, and up he comes with both fists\nclenched.\n\nThese are the truths that must be cited, in explanation of the sad\naffair next to be recorded--the quarrel between two almost equally fine\nfellows,--Dr. Jemmy Fox to wit, and Master Frank Gilham. These two had\nnaturally good liking for each other. There was nothing very marvellous\nabout either of them; although their respective mothers perceived a\nheavenful of that quality. But they might be regarded as fair specimens\nof Englishmen--more wonderful perhaps than admirable in the eyes of\nother races. If it were needful for any one to make choice between them,\nthat choice would be governed more by points of liking, than of merit.\nBoth were brave, straightforward, stubborn, sensible, and\nself-respecting fellows, a little hot-headed sometimes perhaps, but\nnever consciously unjust.\n\nIt seemed a great pity, that such a pair should fall away from\nfriendship, when there were so many reasons for goodwill and amity; not\nto mention gratitude--that flower of humanity, now extinct, through the\nnumber of its cuttings that have all damped off. Jemmy Fox indeed had\ncherished a small slip of that, when Gilham stood by him in his first\ndistress; but unhappily the slightest change of human weather is\ninevitably fatal to our very miffy plant.\n\nYoung as he was, Frank Gilham had been to market already too many times,\nto look for offal value in gratitude, and indeed he was too generous to\nregard it as his due; still his feelings of friendship, and of\nadmiration for the superior powers of the other, were a little aggrieved\nwhen he found himself kept at a distance, and avoided, for reasons which\nhe understood too well. So when he heard that young Dr. Fox had returned\nfrom that visit to his father, he rode up to _Old Barn_, to call upon\nhim, and place things upon a plainer footing.\n\nJemmy received him in a friendly manner, but with his mind made up to\nput a stop to any nonsense concerning his sister Christie, if Gilham\nshould be fool enough to afford him any opening. And this the young\nyeoman did without delay, for he saw no good reason why he should be\nmade too little of.\n\n\"And how did you leave Miss Fox?\" he asked, as they took their chairs\nopposite the great fireplace, in the bare room, scientific with a skull\nor two, and artistic with a few of Christie's water-colour sketches.\n\n\"I had no difficulty in leaving her,\" Jemmy answered, with a very poor\nattempt at wit, which he intended to be exasperating.\n\n\"How was she, I mean? I dare say you got away, without thinking much of\nanybody but yourself.\" Frank Gilham was irritated, as he deserved to be.\n\n\"Thank you; well, I think upon the whole,\" Jemmy Fox drawled out his\nwords, as if his chin were too slack to keep them going, and he stroked\nit in a manner which is always hateful; \"yes, I think I may say upon the\nwhole, that she was quite as well as can be expected. I hope you can say\nthe same of your dear mother.\"\n\nFrank Gilham knew that he was challenged to the combat; and he came\nforth, as the duty is, and the habit of an Englishman.\n\n\"This is not the first time you have been rude to me;\" he said. \"And I\nwon't pretend not to know the reason. You think that I have been guilty\nof some presumption, in daring to lift my eyes to your sister.\"\n\n\"To tell you the truth,\" replied Fox getting up, and meeting his\nsteadfast gaze steadfastly; \"you have expressed my opinion, better than\nI could myself have put it.\"\n\n\"It is not the sort of thing one can argue about,\" said the other, also\nrising; \"I know very well that she is too good for me, and has the right\nto look ever so much higher. But for all that, I have a perfect right to\nset my heart upon her; especially considering--considering, that I can't\nhelp it. And if I do nothing to annoy her, or even to let her know of\nmy presumption, what right have you to make a grievance of it?\"\n\n\"I have never made a grievance of it. I simply wish you to understand,\nthat I do not approve of it.\"\n\n\"You have a perfect right to disapprove; and to let me know that you do\nso. Only it would have been more to your credit, if you had done it in\nan open manner, and in plain English; instead of cutting me, or at any\nrate dropping my acquaintance. I don't call that straightforward.\"\n\n\"The man is a jackass. What rot he talks! Look here, my fine fellow. How\ncould I speak to you about it, before you acknowledged your infatuation?\nCould I come up to you in the street, and say--'Hi there! You are in\nlove with my sister, are you? If you want to keep a sound skin, you'll\nhaul off.' Is that the straightforward course I should have taken?\"\n\n\"Well, there may be something in the way you put it. But I would leave\nit to anybody, whether you have acted fairly. And why should I haul off,\nI should like to know. I won't haul off, for fifty of you. Because I\nhave got no money, I suppose! How would you like to be ordered to haul\noff from Miss Waldron, in case you were to lose your money, or anything\nwent against you? Instead of hauling off, I'll hold on--in my own mind,\nat any rate. I don't want a farthing of the money of your family. I\nwould rather not have it,--dirty stuff, what good is it? But I tell you\nwhat--if your dear sister would only give me one good word, I would snap\nmy fingers at you, and everybody. I know I am nothing at all. However, I\nam quite as good as you are; though not to be spoken of, in the same\nweek with her. I tell you, I don't care twopence for any man, or all the\nmen in the world put together--if only your sister thinks well of me. So\nnow, you know what you may look out for.\"\n\n\"All this is very fine; but it won't do, Gilham.\" Fox thought he saw his\nway to settle him. \"Surely you are old enough to see the folly of\ngetting so excited. My sister will very soon be married to Sir Henry\nHaggerstone--a man of influence, and large fortune. And you--, well to\nsome lady, who can see your value, through a ball of glass, as you do.\nThat power is not given to all of us; but on no account would I\ndisparage you. And when this little joke is over, you will come, and beg\nmy pardon; and we shall be hearty friends again.\"\n\n\"Sir Henry Haggerstone!\" Gilham replied, in a tone of contempt, which\nwould justly have astonished that exemplary baronet. \"Not she! Why,\nthat's the old codger that has had three wives--fiddles, and\nfiddlesticks, I'm not afraid of him! But just tell me one thing now,\nupon your honour. Would you object to me, if she liked me, and I had a\nhundred thousand pounds?\"\n\n\"Well, no, I don't know that I should, Mr. Gilham.\"\n\n\"Then, Dr. Fox, you would sell your sister, for a hundred thousand\npounds. And if she likes to put a lower price upon herself, what right\nhave you to stop her?\"\n\n\"I tell you, Gilham, all this is childish talk. If Christie has been\nfool enough to take a fancy to you, it is your place, as a man of\nhonour, to bear in mind how young she is; and to be very careful that\nyou do nothing to encourage it.\"\n\n\"But there is no chance of such luck. Has it ever seemed likely to you,\nmy dear Jemmy, that she--that she even had any idea----\"\n\n\"A great deal too much, I am afraid. At least, I don't mean to say that\nexactly--but at any rate--well, enough to place you on your honour.\"\n\n\"And upon my honour I will be--not to neglect any shadow of a chance,\nthat turns up in my favour. But I can never believe it, Jemmy; she is\never so much too lofty, and too lovely, and too clever--did anybody ever\nsee such fingers, and such eyes, and such a smile, and such a voice? And\naltogether----\"\n\n\"Altogether a pack of rubbish. The sooner you order your horse, the\nbetter. I can't have you raving here, and fetching all the parish up the\nhill.\"\n\n\"I am a sensible man, Jemmy Fox. I know a noble thing, when I see it.\nYou are too small of nature, and too selfish for such perception. But\nyou may abuse me, to your heart's content. You will never get a harsh\nword in reply; after what you have told me. Because there must be good\nin you, or you would never have such a sister. I shall take my own\ncourse now; without the smallest consideration for your crotchets. Now\ndon't make any mistake about that. And as for honour--clearly\nunderstand, that I shall pitch it to the Devil.\"\n\n\"Well, don't come here with any more of your raving. And don't expect me\nto encourage you. You have been a good fellow--I don't mind saying\nthat--until you took this infernal craze.\"\n\n\"Oh, I won't trouble you; never you fear. You are doing what you think\nright, no doubt; and you are welcome to do your worst. Only there is one\nthing I must say. I know that you are too much of a man, to belie me to\nyour sister, or run me down, behind my back. Shake hands, Jemmy, before\nI go; perhaps we shall never shake hands again.\"\n\n\"Get somebody to leave you that hundred thousand pounds,\" said Fox, as\nhe complied with this request; \"and then we'll shake hands all day long,\ninstead of shaking fists at each other.\"\n\n\n     \"Jem Crow said to his first wife's mother,\n     What right have you to be anybody's brother?\"\n\n\nGilham responded, being in high spirits, with this quotation from that\npiece of negro doggerel, with which all England was at that time crazed.\nAnd thus they parted, with a neutral smile; and none the less perhaps,\nfor that each of them perceived that the parting would prove a long one.\n\n\"What will Nicie have to say about all this? I shall not be contented\nuntil I know;\" said Fox to himself, when his visitor was gone; \"I have a\ngreat mind to go and get my riding-gaiters. That blessed mother of hers\ncan scarcely growl at me, if I call to-day; considering how long I have\nbeen away. I seem to knock under to everybody now. I can't think what\nhas come over me.\"\n\nWhen a man begins to think that of himself, it shows that he is getting\npugnacious, and has not found his proper outlet. The finest thing for\nhim is a long ride then; or a long walk, if he has only two legs. Fox\nwas shaking down upon his merits, but still a little crusty with\nhimself, and therefore very much so with every one outside it, when his\npretty mare pulled up, to think about the water she was bound to walk\nthrough at Priestwell.\n\nThis is one of the fairest hamlets to be found in England. There are\nhouses enough to make one think of the other people that live in them;\nbut not so many as to make it certain that a great many people will be\nnasty. You might expect, if you lived there, to know something about\neverybody in the place; and yet only to lift up your hands, and smile,\nwhen they did a thing you were too wise to do. The critical inhabitant\nin such a place--unless he is very wicked--must be happy. He falls into\na habitude of small smiles; \"many a mickle makes a muckle\"--if that be\nthe right way to quote it, which it isn't--however, the result is all\nthe same, he knows what he is about, and it leads him to smile twenty\ntimes, for one smile he would have had in town.\n\nAll these things were producing a fine effect upon the character of Dr.\nGronow. By head and shoulders, without standing up for himself for a\nsingle moment, he was the biggest man at Priestwell; in knowledge of the\nworld, in acquaintance with books, in power to give good advice, and to\nhelp the people who took it--the largest. And after the many hot\ncontentions of his life, and the trouble in being understood (where the\ngame never pays for the candle) here he was taken at his own\nappraisement, after liberal prepayment.\n\nHe was not a bad man, take him all in all; though inclined by nature to\nbe many-angled, rather than many-sided. And now, as he stood on the\nplank that goes over the brook where the road goes under it, he was\nabout as happy as the best of men can be. The old Doctor in truth was as\nfull of delight--though his countenance never expressed it--as the young\nDoctor was of dejection. And why? For the very noble reason, that the\nwiser man now had his fly-rod in hand, fly-book in pocket, creel on\nback, and waterproof boots upon stiff but sturdy legs. And, main point\nof all--he was just setting forth; his return must be effected perhaps\nin quite another pair of shoes.\n\nThe Priestwell water flows into the Perle from the north, some half mile\nhigher up than the influx of Susscot brook from the south, and it used\nto be full of bright stickles and dark hovers, peopled with many a\nbouncing trout. For a trout of a pound is a bouncer there; and a\nhalf-pounder even is held a comely fish; and sooth to say, the angler is\nnot so churlish as to fail of finding joy in one of half that size. Not\na sign of Spring was on the earth as yet, and very little tidings of it\nin the air; but any amount was in the old man's heart, as he listened to\nthe warbling of the brook, and said to himself that he should catch,\nperhaps, a fish. He was going to fish downwards, as he always did, for\nhe never liked to contradict the water. At the elbow of the stream was\nhis own willow-tree, at the bottom of his lawn, and there a big fish\nlived--the Dr. Gronow of the liquid realm, who defied the Dr. Gronow of\nthe dry land. Ha, why not tackle him this very afternoon, and ennoble\nthe opening day thereby; for the miserable floods, and the long\nsnow-time, and the shackling of the stream is over; no water-colour\nartist could have brought the stickles to a finer fishing tint; and lo,\nthere is a trout upon the rise down there, tempted by the quiver of a\nreal iron-blue!\n\nWith these thoughts glowing in his heart, and the smoke of his pipe\nmaking rings upon the naked alder-twigs, he was giving his flies the\nlast titivating touch--for he always fished with three, though two were\none too many--when he heard a voice not too encouraging.\n\n\"I say, Doctor, if you don't look out, you'll be certain to get bogged,\nyou know.\"\n\n\"Don't care if I do;\" replied the Doctor, whisking his flies around his\nhead, and startling _Perle_ with the flash of his rod.\n\n\"You had better go home,\" continued Jemmy, \"and let the banks dry up a\nbit, and some of your fish have time to breed again. Why, the floods\nmust have washed them all down into the Perle; and the Perle must have\nwashed them all down into the sea.\"\n\n\"That shows how much you know about it. I have got a most splendid\npatent dodge, at the bottom of my last meadow. I'll show it to you some\nfine day, if you are good. It is so constructed that it keeps all my\ntrout from going down into the Perle, and yet it lets all the Perle\ntrout come up to me; and when they are up, they can't get back again of\ncourse. And the same thing reversed, at the top of my grounds. I expect\nto have more fish than pebbles in my brook. And nobody can see it,\nthat's the beauty of it. But mind, you mustn't say a word about it,\nJemmy. People are so selfish!\"\n\n\"Of course, I won't; you may trust me. But when you have got everybody\nelse's fish in your water, can you get them out of it? I know nothing at\nall about it. But to make any hand at angling, is it not the case that\nyou must take to it in early life? Look at Pike, for instance. What a\nhand he is! Never comes home without a basketful. He'll be here again\nnext week, I believe.\"\n\nFox knew well enough that Dr. Gronow hated the very name of Pike.\n\n\"I am truly sorry to hear it. I am sure it must be high time for that\nlad to go to College. Penniloe ought to be sent to prison, for keeping\nsuch a poacher. But as for myself, if I caught too many, I should not\nenjoy it half so much, because I should think there was no skill in it.\"\n\n\"Well, now, I never thought of that. And _pari ratione_ if we save too\nmany of our patients, we lay ourselves open to the charge of luck.\"\n\n\"No fear for you, Jemmy. You are not a lucky fellow. Come in and have a\ntalk with me, by and by. I want to hear the last news, if there is any.\"\n\n\"Yes, there is some. But I must tell you now, or never. For I have to\nride round through Pumpington. And I came this way on purpose, to get\nthe benefit of your opinion.\"\n\n\"But, my dear fellow, it gets dark so soon;\" Dr. Gronow looked wistfully\nat his flies. \"Well, if you won't be more than five minutes, I will put\nan iron-blue on, instead of a Half-Kingdon. But don't be longer than you\ncan help. You are the only man in the parish I would stop for.\"\n\nOmitting all description, except of persons, Fox told the elder doctor\nwhat he had learned at the mouth of the Mendip mine, and at the _Smoking\nLimekiln_, as well as what he knew of Harvey Tremlett from Mr.\nPenniloe's account, reminding him also of Joe Crang's description, and\nshowing how well it tallied.\n\n\"My advice can be given in a word; and that is 'Not a word;'\" answered\nGronow, forgetting his flies for the moment. \"Not a word to any one, but\nMockham the magistrate; and not even to him, until needful.\nShrove-Tuesday, you say, is the date of the Fair. Don't apply for your\nwarrant, until that morning, if you can get it then without delay. Only\nyou must make sure that Mockham will be at home to issue it, and you\nmust have Joe Crang there quietly, and gag him somewhere for the rest of\nthe day--perhaps a little opiate in his beer. You see it is of the first\nimportance that not a word should leak out about your intention of\nnabbing those fellows at the Fair, until you are down upon them; for\nyour birds would never come near the trap. It is perfectly amazing how\nsuch things spread, faster than any bird can fly; for the whole world\nseems to be in league against the law. There is plenty of time for us to\ntalk it over, between this and then, if you only keep it close. Of\ncourse you have not mentioned it to anybody yet.\"\n\n\"Not to a soul. I had sense enough for that. But I might have done so\nbefore long, if I had missed meeting you to-day. Shall I not tell even\nPenniloe? He has known everything hitherto.\"\n\n\"Certainly not yet. He is quite safe of course, so far as mere intention\ngoes; but he might make a slip, and he is a nervous man. For his own\nsake, he had better not have this upon his mind. And his ideas are so\nqueer. If he were questioned, I feel sure that he would not even tell a\nwhite lie; but be frightfully clumsy, and say, 'I refuse to answer.'\nBetter tell the whole truth than do that; for suspicion is shrewder than\ncertainty.\"\n\n\"But I don't like concealing it from him at all. I fear he will be hurt,\nwhen he comes to know it; because we have acted together throughout, and\nthe matter so closely concerns his parish.\"\n\n\"Have no fear, Jemmy. I'll make that all right. We will tell him about\nit on the day of action, and let him know that for his own sake only, I\npersuaded you to keep it from him. Why, that fellow's daughter is in his\nhouse, and a wonderfully clever imp, they say. And I am not at all sure\nthat he would not preach about it. He thinks so much more of people's\nsouls, than of their parts that are rational.\"\n\n\"Very well then, for his own sake, I won't say a word to him about it.\nYou are right; it would make him miserable to have such a shindy so long\nin prospect. For it will be a rare fight, I can tell you. The fellow is\nas big as an elephant almost; and my namesake, Jem Kettel, is a stuggy\nyoung chap, very likely to prove a tough customer. And then there will\nbe Timberlegs, whoever he may be.\"\n\n\"All right, Jemmy, we will give a good account of them. Mind _v._ Matter\nalways wins the verdict. But let me congratulate you upon your luck. We\nmust get to the bottom of this strange affair now, if we can only nab\nthose fellows.\"\n\n\"I should hope so. But how do you think it will prove? Who will be\ndetected as the leading villain? For these rogues have only been hired\nof course.\"\n\n\"Well, I own myself puzzled, Jemmy, worse than ever. Until this last\nnews of yours, I was inclined to think that there had been some strange\nmistake all through, while the good Colonel slept still undisturbed. But\nnow it appears that I must have been wrong. And I hardly like to tell\nyou my last idea, because of your peculiar position.\"\n\n\"I know what you mean, and I thank you for it;\" Fox replied with a rapid\nglance. \"But to my mind that seems the very reason why I should know\neverything.\"\n\n\"Well, if you take it so, friend Jemmy, as my first theory is now proved\nwrong, my second one is that Lady Waldron knows more about this matter\nthan anybody else. She has always shown herself hostile to you, so that\nmy idea cannot shock you, as otherwise it might. Are you angry with me?\"\n\n\"Not in the least; though I cannot believe it, thereby returning good\nfor evil; for she was quick enough to believe it--or feign to do\nso--about me. There are things that tend towards your conclusion. I am\nsorry to acknowledge that there are. And yet, until it is positively\nproved, I will not think it possible. She is no great favourite of mine,\nyou know, any more than I am of hers. Also, I am well aware that women\ndo things a man never would believe; and some women don't mind doing\nanything. But I cannot persuade myself that she is one of that sort. She\nhas too much pride to be a hypocrite.\"\n\n\"So I should have thought. But against facts, where are you? Shrove\nTuesday will tell us a thing or two however. That is a very nice mare of\nyours. I know nothing of horses, but judge them by their eyes; though\ntheir legs are the proper study. Good-bye, my boy! Perhaps I shall amaze\nyou with a dish of trout to-morrow. They are always in very fine\ncondition here.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI.\n\nA GREAT PRIZE.\n\n\nOne of the beauties of this world is, for the many who are not too good\nfor it, that they never can tell what may turn up next, and need not\nover-exert themselves in the production of novelty, because somebody\nwill be sure to do it for them. And those especially who have the honour\nand pleasure of dealing with the gentler sex are certain, without any\neffort of their own, to encounter plenty of vicissitude.\n\nSuch was the fortune of Dr. Fox, when he called that day at\nWalderscourt. He found his sweet Nicie in a sad condition, terribly\ndepressed, and anxious, in consequence of a long interview with her\nmother, which had been as follows.\n\nFor the last fortnight, or three weeks, Lady Waldron had not recovered\nstrength, but fallen away even more, declining into a peculiar and\nmorbid state. Sometimes gloomy, downcast, and listless, secluding\nherself, and taking very little food, and no exercise whatever; at other\ntimes bewildered, excited, and restless, beginning a sentence and\nbreaking it off, laughing about nothing, and then morose with every one.\nPretty Tamar Haddon had a great deal to put up with, and probably would\nnot have shown the needful patience, except for handsome fees lightly\nearned by reports collected in the village. But Sergeant Jakes being\naccessible no more--for he had cast off the spell in the Abbey, that\nSunday--poor Lady Waldron's anxiety was fed with tales of very doubtful\nauthority. And the strange point was that she showed no impatience at\nthe tardiness of the enquiry now, but rather a petulant displeasure at\nits long continuance.\n\nNow that very morning, while Fox was on the road to call upon his\nbeloved, she was sent for suddenly by her mother, and hastened with some\nanxiety to the room which the widow now left so seldom. Inez had long\nbeen familiar with the truth that her mother's love for her was not too\nardent; and she often tried--but without much success--to believe that\nthe fault was on her part. The mother ascribed it very largely to some\ndefect in her daughter's constitution. \"She has not one drop of Spanish\nblood in her. She is all of English, except perhaps her eyes; and the\neyes do not care to see things of Spain.\" Thus she justified herself,\nunconscious perhaps that jealousy of the father's love for this pet\nchild had been, beyond doubt, the first cause of her own estrangement.\n\nThis terribly harassed and lonely woman (with no one but God to comfort\nher, and very little sense of any consolation thus) was now forsaken by\nthat support of pride and strength of passion, which had enabled her at\nfirst to show a resolute front to affliction. Leaning back upon a heavy\ncouch, she was gazing without much interest at the noble ivory crucifix,\nwhich had once so strongly affected her, but now was merely a work of\nart, a subject for admiration perhaps, but not for love or enthusiasm.\nOf these there was no trace in her eyes, only apathy, weariness,\ndespondence.\n\n\"Lock the outer door. I want no spies,\" she said in a low voice which\nalarmed her daughter; \"now come and sit close to me in this chair. I\nwill speak in my own language. None but you and I understand it here\nnow.\"\n\n\"It is well, mother mine,\" replied her daughter, speaking also in\nSpanish; \"but I wish it were equally well with you.\"\n\n\"It will never be well with me again, and the time will be long before\nit can be well with you. I have doubted for days about telling you, my\nchild, because I am loth to grieve you. But the silence upon this matter\nis very bitter to me; moreover it is needful that you should know, in\ncase of my obtaining the blessed release, that you also be not triumphed\nover. It is of that unholy outrage I must speak. Long has it been a\nblack mystery to us. But I understand it now--alas, I cannot help\nunderstanding it!\"\n\nInez trembled exceedingly; but her mother, though deadly pale, was\ncalm. Both face and voice were under stern control, and there were no\ndramatic gestures.\n\n\"Never admit him within these doors, if I am not here to bar them. Never\ntake his hand, never listen to his voice, never let your eyes rest upon\nhis face. Never give him a crust, though he starve in a ditch; never let\nhim be buried with holy rites. As he has treated my dear husband, so\nshall God treat him, when he is dead. It is for this reason that I tell\nyou. If you loved your father, remember it.\"\n\n\"But who is it, mother? What man is this, who has abandoned his soul to\nthe Evil One? Make me sure of his name, that I may obey you.\"\n\n\"The man who has done it is my own twin-brother, Rodrigo, Count de\nVarcas: Rodrigo, the accursed one.\"\n\nThe Spanish lady clasped her hands, and fell back against the wall, and\ndropped her eyes; as if the curse were upon her also, for being akin to\nthe miscreant. Her daughter could find no words, and was in doubt of\nbelieving her own ears.\n\n\"Yes, I know well what I am saying;\" Lady Waldron began again with some\ncontempt. \"I am strong enough. Offer me nothing to smell. Shall I never\ndie? I ought to have died, before I knew this, if there were any mercy\nin Heaven. That my twin-brother, my own twin-brother, the one I have\nloved and laboured for, and even insulted my own good husband, because\nhe would not bow down to him--not for any glory, revenge, or religion,\nbut for the sake of grovelling money--oh Inez, my child, that he should\nhave done this!\"\n\n\"But how do you know that he has done it? Has he made any confession,\nmother? Surely it is possible to hope against it, unless he himself has\nsaid so.\"\n\n\"He has not himself said so. He never does. To accuse himself is no part\nof his habits, but rather to blame every other. And such is his manner\nthat every one thinks he must be right and his enemies wrong. But to\nthose who have experience of him, the question is often otherwise. You\nremember that very--very faithful gentleman, who came to us, about a\nmonth ago?\"\n\n\"Mother, can you mean that man, arrogant but low, who consumed all my\ndear father's boxes of cigars, and called himself Se\u00c3\u00b1or Jos\u00c3\u00a9 Quevedo,\nand expected even me to salute him as of kin?\"\n\n\"Hush, my child! He is your Uncle's foster-brother, and trusted by him\nin everything. You know that I have in the Journals announced my desire\nto hear from my beloved brother--beloved alas too much, and vainly. I\nwas long waiting, I was yearning, having my son in the distance, and you\nwho went against me in everything, to embrace and be strengthened by my\nonly brother. What other friend had I on earth? And in answer to my\nanxiety arrives that man, sedate, mysterious, not to be doubted, but\nregarded as a lofty cavalier. I take him in, I trust him, I treat him\nhighly, I remember him as with my brother always in the milky days of\nchildhood, although but the son of a well-intentioned peasant. And then\nI find what? That he has come for money--for money, which has always\nbeen the bane of my only and well-born brother, for the very dismal\nreason that he cannot cling to it, and yet must have both hands filled\nwith it for ever. Inez, do you attend to me?\"\n\n\"Mother, I am doing so, with all my ears; and with all my heart as well\nI heed. But these things surprise me much, because I have always heard\nfrom you that my Uncle Rodrigo was so noble, so chivalrous, so far above\nall Englishmen, by reason of the grandeur of his spirit.\"\n\n\"And in that style will he comport himself, upon most of life's\noccasions, wherein money does not act as an impediment. Of that\ncharacter is he always, while having more than he can spend of it. But\nlet him see the necessity, and the compulsion to deny himself, too near\nto him approaching, and he will not possess that loftiness of spirit,\nand benevolence universal. Departing from his larger condition of mind,\nhe will do things which honour does not authorise. Things unworthy of\nthe mighty Barcas, from whom he is descended. But the Barcas have often\nbeen strong and wicked; which is much better than weak and base.\"\n\nHer ladyship paused, as in contemplation of the sterling nobility of her\nrace, and apparently derived some comfort from the strong wickedness of\nthe Barcas.\n\n\"Mother, I hope that it is not so.\" Nicie's view of excellence was\nmilder. \"You are strong but never wicked. I am not strong; but on the\nother hand, I trust, that I am not weak and base.\"\n\n\"You never can tell what you can do. You may be most wicked of the\nwicked yet. Those English girls, that are always good, are braised\nvegetables without pepper. The only one I ever saw to approve, was the\none who was so rude to me. How great her indignation was! She is worthy\nto be of Andalusia.\"\n\n\"But why should so wicked a thing be done--so horrible even from a\nstranger?\" The flashing of Nicie's dark eyes was not unworthy of\nAndalusia. \"How could the meanest greed of money be gratified by such a\ndeed?\"\n\n\"In this manner, if I understand aright. During the time of the French\ninvasion, just before our marriage, the Junta of our City had to bear a\ngreat part of the burden of supporting and paying our brave troops. They\nfell into great distress for money, which became scarcer and scarcer,\nfrom the terrible war, and the plundering. All lovers of their country\ncame with both hands full of treasure; and among them my father\ncontributed a loan of noble magnitude, which has impaired for years to\ncome the fortunes of our family. For not a _peseta_ will ever be repaid,\ninasmuch as there was no security. When all they could thus obtain was\nspent, and the richest men would advance no more, without prospect of\nregaining it, the Junta (of which my father was a member) contrived that\nthe City should combine with them in pledging its revenues, which were\nlarge, to raise another series of loans. And to obtain these with more\nspeed, they appealed to the spirit of gambling; which is in the hearts\nof all men, but in different forms and manners.\n\n\"One loan that was promulgated thus amounted to 100,000 dollars,\ncontributed in twenty shares of 5,000 dollars each: and every share was\nto have a life of not less than fifteen years in age appointed to\nrepresent it. No money was to be repaid; but the interest to accumulate,\nuntil nineteen out of those twenty lives became extinct, and thereupon\nthe whole was to go to the last survivor, and by that time it would be a\nvery large sum. I believe that the scheme came from the French, who are\nwonderfully clever in such calculations; whereas finance is not of us.\nDo you seem to yourself to understand it?\"\n\n\"Not very much, but to some extent. I have read of a wheel of life; and\nthis appears to me to be a kind of wheel of death.\"\n\n\"So it is, my child. You can scarcely be so stupid, as you have been\ndescribed to me. I am not too strong of the arithmetic science, though\nin other ways not wanting. You will see, that there was a royal treasure\nthus, increasing for the one who should deserve it, by having more of\nlife than the nineteen others, and acquiring it thus, for the time he\nhad to come. That kind of lottery, coming from Paris, was adopted by\nother Governments, under the title of _Tontine_, I think. My dear\nfather, who was a warm patriot, but unable to contribute more without\nhope of return, accepted two of those five thousand dollar shares, and\nput into one the name of my brother, and into the other that of my dear\nhusband, then about to be: because those two were young, while himself\nwas growing old. Your father has spoken to me of his share, several\ntimes, as it became of greater value; and he provided for it in his\nwill, supposing that he should ever become the possessor, although he\napproved not of any kind of gambling.\n\n\"If you can represent to yourself that scheme, you will see that each\nshare was enlarged in prospect, as the others failed of theirs by death;\nand, of the twenty lives appointed, the greater part vanished rapidly;\nmany by war, and some by duels, and others by accident and disease;\nuntil it appears--though we knew it not--that your father and your Uncle\nRodrigo were the sole survivors. Your father and I kept no watch upon\nit, being at such a distance; but now I have learned that your Uncle has\nbeen exceedingly acute and vigilant, having no regard for your dear\nfather, and small affection, I fear, for me; but a most passionate\ndevotion to the huge treasure now accumulated upon heavy interest, and\nsecured by the tolls of the City.\n\n\"I am grieved by discovering from this man Quevedo, that your Uncle has\nbeen watching very keenly everything that has happened here; he has\nemployed an agent, whose name I could not by any means extort from\nQuevedo, and not contented with his reports, but excited by the tidings\nof your father's ill-health, he has even been present in these parts\nhimself, to reconnoitre for himself; for he is capable of speaking\nEnglish, even better than I do. Quevedo is very cautious; but by plying\nhim with Spanish wine, such as he cannot procure in Spain, feigning also\nto be on his side, I extorted from him more than he wished to part with.\nNo suspicion had I, while he was here, that his master was guilty of the\nblack disgrace thus inflicted upon us: or can you imagine that I would\nallow that man to remain in the house of the outraged one? And Quevedo\nhimself either feigns, or possesses, total ignorance of this vile deed.\"\n\n\"But, mother dear, how did this suspicion grow upon you? And for what\npurpose--if I may inquire--was that man Quevedo sent to you?\"\n\n\"He was sent with two objects. To obtain my signature to an attested\ndeclaration as to the date of your father's death; and in the second\nplace to borrow money for the support of your Uncle's claim. It could\nnot be expected that the City would discharge so vast a sum (more than\nfive hundred thousand crowns they say) without interposing every\npossible obstacle and delay; and our family, through your Uncle's\nconduct, has lost all the influence it possessed when I was young. I am\npleased to think now that he must be disappointed with the very small\nsum which I advanced, in my deep disgust at discovering, that at the\nvery time when I was sighing and languishing for his support, he was at\nmy very doors, but through his own selfish malignity avoided his\ntwin-sister. Quevedo meant not to have told me that. But alas! I\nextorted it from him, after a slip of his faithful tongue. For you know,\nI believe, that your father and uncle were never very friendly. My\nbrother liked not that I should wed an Englishman; all men of this\nnation he regarded with contempt, boasting as they did in our country,\nwhere we permitted them to come and fight. But you have never been told,\nmy child, that the scar upon your dear father's face was inflicted by\nyour Uncle's sword, employed (as I am ashamed to confess) in an unfair\ncombat. Upon recovering from the stealthy blow, your father in his great\nstrength could have crushed him to death, for he was then a stripling;\nbut for my sake he forbore. It has been concealed from you. There is no\nconcealment now.\"\n\n\"Oh, mother, how savage and ignominious also! I wonder that you ever\ncould desire to behold such a man again; and that you could find it in\nyour heart to receive his envoy kindly.\"\n\n\"Many years have passed since then, my child. And we have a saying, 'To\na fellow-countryman forgive much, and to a brother everything.' Your\nfather had forgiven him, before the wound was healed. Much more slowly\ndid I forgive. And, but for this matter, never would I have spoken.\"\n\n\"Oh, mother dear, you have had much sorrow! I have never considered it,\nas I should have done. A child is like an egg, as you say in Spain, that\ndemands all the warmth for itself, and yields none. Yet am I surprised,\nthat knowing so much of him, you still desired his presence, and\nlistened to the deceits of his messenger. But you have wisdom; and I\nhave none. Tell me then what he had to gain, by an outrage hateful to a\nhuman being, and impossible to a Christian.\"\n\n\"It is not clear, my child, to put it to your comprehension. The things\nthat are of great power with us are not in this Country so copious. We\nare loftier. We are more friendly with the Great Powers that reside\nabove. In every great enterprise, we feel what would be their own\nsentiments; though not to be explained by heretical logic. Your Uncle\nhas never been devoted to the Church, and has profited little by her\nteaching; but he is not estranged from her so much, that he need in\nhonour hesitate to have use and advantage from her charitable breast.\nFor she loves every one, even those who mock her, with feeble imitation\nof her calls.\"\n\n\"Mother, but hitherto you have cared little or nothing for Holy Church.\nYou have allowed me to wander from her; and my mind is the stronger for\nthe exercise. Why then this new zeal and devotion?\"\n\n\"Inez, the reason is very simple; although you may not understand it\nyet. We love the Institutions that make much of us, even when we are\ndead, and comfort our bodies with ceremonies, and the weepers with\nreasons for smiling. This heretic corporation, to which Mr. Penniloe\nbelongs, has many good things imitated from us; but does not understand\nitself. Therefore, it is not a power in the land, to govern the law, or\nto guide great actions of property and of behaviour, as the Holy\nCatholic Church can do, in the lands where she has not been deposed.\nKnowing how such things are with us, your Uncle (as I am impelled to\nbelieve), having plenty of time for preparation, had arranged to make\none master-stroke, towards this great object of his life. At once to\nbring all the Ecclesiastics to his side with fervour, and before the\nmultitude to prove his claim in a manner the most dramatic.\n\n\"Behold it thus, as upon a stage! The whole City is agitated with the\nnews, and the immensity of his claim. The young men say that it is just\nto pay it, if it can be proved, for the honour of the City. But the old\nmen shake their heads, and ask where is the money to come from; what new\ntolls can be imposed; and who can believe a thing, that must be proved\nby the oaths of foreign heretics?\n\n\"Lo there appears the commanding figure of the Count de Varcas before\nthe great Cathedral doors; behind him a train of sailors bear the body\nof the great British warrior, well-known among the elder citizens by his\nlofty stature and many wounds, renowned among the younger as a mighty\nhero. The Bishop, Archbishop, and all powers of the Church (being dealt\nwith privately beforehand) are moved to tears by this Act of Grace, this\nmanifest conversion of a noble Briton, claiming the sacred rites of\n_Campo Santo_, and not likely to enjoy them without much munificence,\nwhen that most righteous claim upon the Seculars is paid. Dares any one\nto doubt identity? Behold, upon the finger of the departed one, is the\nvery ring with which the City's benefactor sealed his portion of the\ncovenant; and which he presented to his son-in-law, as a holy relic of\nhis ancient family, upon betrothal to his daughter.\n\n\"Thereupon arises the universal cry--'redeem the honour of the City.' A\nfew formalities still remain; one of which is satisfied by the arrival\nof Quevedo with my deposition. The noble Count, the descendant of the\nBarcas, rides in a chariot extolled by all, and scatters a few _pesetas_\nof his half a million dollars. It was gained by lottery, it goes by\ngambling; in six months he is penniless again. He has robbed his\nbrother's grave in vain. For another hundred dollars, he would rob his\ntwin-sister's.\"\n\n\"Oh, mother, it is horrible! Too horrible to be true. And yet how it\nclears up everything! And even so, how much better it is, than what we\nsupposed, and shuddered at! But have you any evidence beyond suspicion?\nIf it is not unbecoming, I would venture to remind you, that you have\nalready in your mind condemned another, whose innocence is now\nestablished.\"\n\n\"Nay, not established, except to minds that are, like mine, full of\ncharity. It is not impossible, that he may have joined my brother--oh\nthat I should call him so!--in this abominable enterprise. I say it not,\nto vex you in your lofty faith. But it would have made that enterprise\nfar easier to arrange. And if a noble Spaniard can stoop thus, why\nshould not a common Englishman?\"\n\n\"Because he is a gentleman;\" cried Nicie, rising with a flash of\nindignation, \"which a nobleman sometimes is not. And since you have\nspoken thus, I doubt the truth of your other accusation. But that can\nvery soon be put to the test, by making enquiry on the spot. If what you\nsuppose has happened at all, it must be of public knowledge there. Have\nyou sent any one to enquire about it?\"\n\n\"Not yet. I have not long seen things clearly. Only since that Quevedo\nleft, it has come upon me by reasoning. Neither do I know of any trusty\nperson. It must be one faithful to the family, and careful of its\nreputation; for the disgrace shall never be known in this cold England.\nRemember therefore, I say, that you speak no word, not even to Mr.\nPenniloe, or Dr. Fox, of this conclusion forced upon me. If in justice\nto others we are compelled to avow that the deed was of the family, we\nmust declare that it was of piety and high religious feeling, and\nstrictly conceal that it was of sordid lucre.\"\n\n\"But mother, they may in the course of their own enquiries discover how\nit was at last. The last things ascertained tend that way. And if they\nshould find any trace of ship----\"\n\n\"I have given orders to drop all further searches. And you must use your\ninfluence with--with all you have any sway upon, that nothing more shall\nbe done at present. Of course you will not supply the reason; but say\nthat it has been so arranged. Now go, my child; I have talked too long.\nMy strength is not as it was, and I dwell most heavily on the better\ndays. But one thing I would enjoin upon you. Until I speak again of that\nwhich I have seen in my own mind, to its distress and misery, ask me no\nmore about it, neither in any way refer to it. The Lord,--who is not of\nthis Church, or that, but looks down upon us from the Crucifix,--He can\npity and protect us. But you will be glad that I have told you this;\nbecause it will devour me the less.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII.\n\nPLEADINGS.\n\n\n\"But it will devour me the more. My mother cannot love me;\" the poor\ngirl was obliged to think, as she sat in her lonely room again. \"She has\nlaid this heavy burden on me; and I am to share it with no one. Does she\nsuppose that I feel nothing, and am wholly absorbed in love-proceedings,\nforgetting all duty to my father? Sometimes I doubt almost whether Jemmy\nFox is worthy of my affection. I am not very precious. I know that--the\nlesson is often impressed upon me--but I know that I am simple, and\nloving, and true; and he takes me too much for granted. If he were\nnoble, and could love with all his heart, would he be so hard upon his\nsister, for liking a man, who is her equal in everything but money? The\nnext time I see him, I will try him about that. If a man is noble, as I\nunderstand the word, he will be noble for others, as well as for\nhimself. Uncle Penniloe is the only real nobleman I know; because to him\nothers are equal to himself.\"\n\nThis was only a passing mood, and not practical enough to be permanent.\nHowever it was the prevailing one, when in came Jemmy Fox himself. That\nyoung doctor plumed himself upon his deep knowledge of the fairer sex;\nand yet like the rest of mankind who do so, he showed little of that\nknowledge in his dealings with them.\n\nIn the midst of so many doubts and fears, and with a miserable sense of\nloneliness, Miss Waldron was in \"a high-strung condition\"--as ladies\nthemselves describe it--though as gentle and affectionate as ever. She\nwas gazing at little pet _Pixie_, and wondering in her self-abasement,\nwhether there is any human love so deep, devoted, and everlasting (while\nhis little life endures) as that of an ordinary dog. _Pixie_, the\npug-dog, sitting at her feet was absorbed in wistful watching, too sure\nthat his mistress was plunged in trouble, beyond the reach of his poor\nmind, but not perhaps beyond the humble solace of such a yearning heart.\n\nIn this interchange of tender feelings, a still more tender vein was\ntouched. \"Squeak!\" went _Pixie_, with a jump, and then a long eloquence\nof yelp and howl proved that he partook too deeply of the woe he had\nprayed to share. A heavy riding-boot had crushed his short but\nsympathetic tail--the tail he was so fond of chasing as a joyful vision,\nbut now too mournfully and materially his own!\n\nDr. Fox, with a cheerful smile, as if he had done something meritorious,\ngazed into Nicie's sparkling eyes. Perhaps he expected a lovely kiss,\nafter his long absence.\n\n\"Why, you don't seem to care a bit for what you have done!\" cried the\nyoung girl, almost repelling him. \"Allow me to go to my wounded little\ndear. Oh you poor little persecuted pet, what did they do to you? Was\nhis lovely taily broken? Oh the precious little martyr, that he should\nhave come to this! Did a monstrous elephant come, and crush his darling\nlife out? Give his Missy a pretty kiss, with the great tears rolling on\nhis cheek.\"\n\n\"Well, I wish you'd make half as much fuss about me;\" said Fox, with all\nthe self-command that could well be expected. \"You haven't even asked me\nhow I am!\"\n\n\"Oh, I beg your pardon then;\" she answered, looking up at him, with the\nlittle dog's nose cuddled into her neck, and his short sobs puffing up\nthe golden undergrowth of her darkly-clustering hair. \"Yes, to be sure,\nI should have asked that. It was very forgetful of me. But his poor tail\nseems to be a little easier now; and the vigour of your step shows how\nwell you have come back to us.\"\n\n\"Well, more than welcome, I am afraid. I can always make allowance for\nthe humours of young ladies; and I know how good and sweet you are. But\nI think you might have been glad to see me.\"\n\n\"Not when you tread upon my dear dog's tail, and laugh in my face\nafterwards, instead of being very sorry. I should have begged pardon, if\nI had been so clumsy as to tread upon a dog of yours.\"\n\n\"Dogs are all very well, in their way; but they have no right to get\ninto our way. This poor little puggie's tail is all right now. Shake\nhands, Puggie. Why, look! He has forgiven me.\"\n\n\"That shows how wonderfully kind he is, and how little he deserves to be\ntrodden on. But I will not say another word about that; only you might\nhave been sorrier. Their consciences are so much better than ours. He is\nlicking your hand, as if he had done the wrong. Your sister agreed with\nme about their nobility. How is darling Christie?\"\n\n\"Everybody is a darling, except me to-day! Christie is well enough. She\nalways is; except when she goes a cropper out of a trap, and knocks\nyoung men's waistcoat-buttons off.\"\n\n\"How coarsely you put it, when you ought to be most thankful to the\ngentleman who rescued her, when you left her at the mercy of a half-wild\nhorse!\"\n\n\"I don't know what to make of you to-day, Miss Waldron. Have I done\nanything to offend you? You are too just and sensible, and--gentle, I\nshould like to say--not to know that you have put an entirely wrong\nconstruction upon that little accident with Farrant's old screw. It was\nChristie's own fault, every bit of it. She thought herself a grand whip,\nand she came to grief; as girls generally do, when they are bumptious.\"\n\n\"You seem to have a great contempt for girls, Dr. Fox. What have the\npoor things done to offend you so?\"\n\n\"Somebody must have been speaking against me. I'd give a trifle to know\nwho it is. I have always been accustomed to reasonable treatment.\"\n\n\"There now, his dear little tail is better! Little _Pixie_ loves me so.\nLittle _Pixie_ never tells somebody that she is an unreasonable\ncreature. Little _Pixie_ is too polite for that.\"\n\n\"Well, I think I had better be off for the day. I have heard of people\ngetting out of bed the wrong side; and you can't make it right all the\nday, when that has happened. Miss Waldron, I must not go away without\nsaying that my sister sends you her very best love. I was to be sure to\nremember that.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you, Dr. Fox! Your sister is always so very sweet and\nconsiderate. And I hope she has also been allowed to send it where it is\ndue, a thousand times as much as here.\"\n\n\"Where can that be? At the rectory, I suppose. Yes, she has not\nforgotten Mr. Penniloe. She is not at all fickle in her likings.\"\n\n\"Now that is a very fine quality indeed, as well as a very rare one. And\nanother she has, and will not be driven from it; and I own that I quite\nagree with her. She does not look down upon other people, and think that\nthey belong to another world, because they are not so well off in this\none as she is. A gentleman is a gentleman, in her judgment, and is not\nto be cast by, after many kind acts, merely because he is not made of\nmoney.\"\n\n\"Ah, now I see what all this comes to!\" exclaimed Fox, smiling\npleasantly. \"Well, I am quite open to a little reasoning there, because\nthe whole thing is so ridiculous. Now put it to yourself; how would you\nlike to be a sort of son-in-law to good Mother Gilham's green\ncoal-scuttle? A coal-scuttle should make one grateful, you will say.\nHear, hear! not at all a bad pun that; though quite involuntary.\"\n\n\"The bonnet may be behind the age, or in front of it, I know not which;\"\nsaid Nicie, very resolute to show no smile; \"but a better and sweeter\nold face never looked----\"\n\n\"A better horse never looked out of a bridle. It is bridle, and\nblinkers, and saddle, all in one.\"\n\n\"It is quite useless trying to make me laugh.\" Her voice however belied\nher; and _Pixie_ watching her face began to wag the wounded tail again.\n\"Your sister, who knows what bonnets are, to which you can have no\npretension, is well acquainted with the sterling value----\"\n\n\"Oh come, I am sure it would not fetch much now, though it may have cost\ntwo guineas, or more, in the days before 'my son Frank' was born.\"\n\n\"Really, Jemmy, you are too bad, when I want to talk seriously.\"\n\n\"So long as I am 'Jemmy' once more, I don't care how bad I am.\"\n\n\"That was a slip. But you must listen to me. I will not be laughed off\nfrom saying what I think. Do you suppose that it is a joking matter for\npoor Frank Gilham?\"\n\n\"I don't care a copper for his state of mind, if Chris is not fool\nenough to share it. The stupid fellow came to me this morning, and\ninstead of trying to smoothe me down, what does he do but blow me up\nsky-high! You should have heard him. He never swore at all, but gave\nutterance to the noblest sentiments--just because they were in his\nfavour.\"\n\n\"Then I admire him for it. It was very manly of him. Why were all large\nideas in his favour? Just because the small ones are on your side. I\nsuppose, you pretend to care for me?\"\n\n\"No pretence about it. All too true. And this is what I get done to me?\"\n\n\"But how would you like my brother to come and say--'I disapprove of Dr.\nFox. I forbid you to say another word to him'? Would you recognize his\nfraternal right in the matter, and go away quietly?\"\n\n\"Hardly that. I should leave it to you. And if you held by me, I should\nsnap my fingers at him.\"\n\n\"Of course you would. And so would anybody else; Frank Gilham among the\nnumber. And your sister--is she to have no voice, because you are a\nroaring lion? Surely her parents, and not her brother, should bar the\nway, if it must be barred. Just think of yourself, and ask yourself how\nyour own law would fit you.\"\n\n\"The cases are very different, and you know it as well as I do. Frank\nGilham is quite a poor man; and, although he is not a bad kind of\nfellow, his position in the world is not the same as ours.\"\n\n\"That may be so. But if Christie loves him, and is quite content with\nhis position in the world, and puts up with the coal-scuttle--as you\ncall it--and he is a good man and true, and a gentleman, are they both\nto be miserable, to please you? And more than that--you don't know\nChristie. If Frank Gilham shows proper courage, and is not afraid of\nmean imputations, no one will ask your leave, I think.\"\n\n\"Well, I shall have done my best; and if I cannot stop it, let them rue\nthe day. Her father and mother would never allow it; and as I am\nresponsible for the whole affair, and cannot consult them, as things are\nnow, I am bound to act in their place, I think. But never mind that. One\nmay argue for ever, and a girl in a moment can turn the tables on the\ncleverest man alive. Let us come back to our own affairs. I have some\nnews which ought to please you. By rare good luck I have hit upon the\nvery two men who were employed upon that awful business. I shall have\nthem soon, and then we shall know all about this most mysterious case.\nBy George, it shall go hard indeed with the miscreant who plotted it.\"\n\n\"Oh don't--oh don't! What good can it be?\" cried Nicie, trembling, and\nstammering. \"It will kill my mother; I am sure it will. I implore you\nnot to go on with it.\"\n\n\"What!\" exclaimed Fox with amazement. \"You to ask me, you his only\ndaughter, to let it be so--to hush up the matter--to submit to this\natrocious wrong! And your father--it is the last thing I ever should\nhave thought to hear.\"\n\nIn shame and terror she could not speak, but quailed before his\nindignant gaze, and turned away from him with a deep low sob.\n\n\"My darling, my innocent dear,\" he cried in alarm at her bitter anguish;\n\"give me your hand; let me look at your face. I know that no power on\nearth would make you do a thing that you saw to be shameful. I beg your\npardon humbly, if I spoke too harshly. You know that I would not vex\nyou, Inez, and beyond any doubt you can explain this strange--this\ninconceivable thing. You are sure to have some good reason for it.\"\n\n\"Yes, you would say so if you knew all. But not now--I dare not; it is\ntoo dreadful. It is not for myself. If I had my own way--but what use? I\ndare not even tell you that. For the present, at least for the present,\ndo nothing. If you care about me at all, I beg you not to do what would\nnever be forgiven. And my mother is in such a miserable state, so\ndelicate, so frail, and helpless! Do for my sake, do show this once,\nthat you have some affection for me.\"\n\nNicie put her soft hand on his shoulder, and pleaded her cause with no\nmore words, but a gaze of such tenderness and sweet faith, that he could\nnot resist it. Especially as he saw his way to reassure her, without\ndeparting from the plan he had resolved upon.\n\n\"I will do anything, my pretty dove,\" he said with a noble surrender;\n\"to relieve your precious and trustful heart. I will even do this, if it\nsatisfies you--I will take no steps for another month, an entire month\nfrom this present time. I cannot promise more than that, now can I, for\nany bewitchment? And in return, you must pledge yourself to give your\nmother not even a hint of what I have just told you. It would only make\nher anxious, which would be very bad for her health, poor thing; and she\nhas not the faith in me, that you have. She must not even dream that I\nhave heard of those two villains.\"\n\nThis was a bright afterthought of his; for if Lady Waldron should know\nof his discovery, she might contrive to inform them, that he had his eye\nupon them.\n\n\"Oh, how good you are!\" cried Nicie. \"I can never thank you enough, dear\nJemmy; and it must appear so cruel of me, to ask you to forego so long\nthe chance of shaming those low people, who have dared to belie you so.\"\n\n\"What is a month, compared to you?\" Jemmy asked, with real greatness.\n\"But if you feel any obligation, you know how to reward me, dear.\"\n\nNicie looked at him, with critical eyes; and then as if reckless of\nanything small, flung both arms round his neck, and kissed him.\n\n\"Oh it is so kind, so kind of him!\" she declared to herself, to excuse\nherself; while he thought it was very kind of her. And she, being timid\nof her own affection, loved him all the more for not encroaching on it.\n\nJemmy rode away in a happy frame of mind. He loved that beautiful\nmaiden, and he was assured of her love for him. He knew that she was far\nabove him, in the gifts of nature, and the bloom that beautifies\nthem--the bloom that is not of the cheeks alone, but of the gentle dew\nof kindness, and the pearl of innocence. Fox felt a little ashamed of\nhimself, for a trifle of sharp practice; but his reason soon persuaded\nhim, that his conscience was too ticklish. And that is a thing to be\nstopped at once.\n\nWhile jogging along in this condition, on the road towards Pumpington,\nhe fell in with another horseman less inclined to cheerfulness. This was\nFarmer Stephen Horner, a younger brother of Farmer John, a less\nsubstantial, and therefore perhaps more captious agriculturist. He was\nriding a very clever cob, and looked both clever and smart himself, in\nhis bottle-green cutaway coat, red waistcoat, white cord breeches and\nhard brown hat. Striking into the turnpike road from a grass-track\nskirting the Beacon Hill, he hailed the Doctor, and rode beside him.\n\n\"Heard the news, have 'e?\" asked Farmer Steve, as his fat calves creaked\nagainst the saddle-flaps within a few inches of Jemmy's, and their\nhorses kept step, like a dealer's pair. \"But there--come to think of it,\nI be a fool for asking, and you always along of Passon so?\"\n\n\"Only came home yesterday. Haven't seen him yet,\" the Doctor answered\nbriskly. \"Haven't heard anything particular. Nothing the matter with\nhim, I hope?\"\n\n\"Not him, sir, so much as what he've taken up. Hath made up his mind, so\npeople say, to abolish our old Fair to Perlycross.\" Farmer Steve watched\nthe Doctor's face. He held his own opinion, but he liked to know the\nother's first. Moreover he owed him a little bill.\n\n\"But surely he cannot do that;\" said Fox, who cared not a jot about the\nfair, but thought of his own concern with it. \"Why, it was granted by\ncharter, I believe, hundreds of years ago; when Perlycross was a much\nlarger place, and the main road to London passed through it, as the\npack-saddle teams do still sometimes.\"\n\n\"So it were, sir, so it were. Many's the time when I were a boy, I have\nread of Magner Charter, and the time as they starved the King in the\nisland, afore the old yew-tree come on our old tower. But my brother\nJohn, he reckoneth as he knoweth everything; and he saith our\nmarket-place belongeth to the Dean and Chapter, and Fair was granted to\nChurch, he saith, and so Church can abolish it. But I can't see no sense\nin that. Why, it be outside of Church railings altogether. Now you are\na learned man, Doctor Fox. And if you'll give me your opinion, I can\npromise 'e, it shan't go no further.\"\n\n\"The plain truth is,\" replied Jemmy, knowing well that if his opinion\nwent against the Parson, it would be all over the parish by supper-time,\n\"I have never gone into the subject, and I know nothing whatever about\nit. But we all know the Fair has come down to nothing now. There has not\nbeen a beast there for the last three years, and nothing but a score of\npigs, and one pen of sheep last year. It has come to be nothing but a\npleasure-fair, with a little show of wrestling, and some singlestick\nplay, followed by a big bout of drinking. Still I should have thought\nthere would be at least a twelvemonth's notice, and a public\nproclamation.\"\n\n\"So say I, sir; and the very same words I used to my brother John, last\nnight. John Horner is getting a'most too big, with his Churchwarden, and\nhis hundred pounds, he had better a' kept for his family. Let 'un find\nout who have robbed his own Churchyard, afore 'a singeth out again' a\npoor man's glass of ale. I don't hold with John in all things; though a'\nhath key pianner for's dafters, and addeth field to field, same as rich\nman in the Bible laid up treasure for his soul this night. I tell you\nwhat, Doctor, and you may tell John Horner--I likes old things, for\nbeing old; though there may be more bad than good in them. What harm, if\na few chaps do get drunk, and the quarrelsome folks has their heads\ncracked? They'd only go and do it somewhere else, if they was stopped of\nour place. Passon be a good man as ever lived, and wonnerful kind to the\npoor folk. But a' beginneth to have his way too much; and all along of\nmy brother John. To tell you the truth, Doctor, I couldn't bear the job\nabout that old tombstone, to memory of Squire Jan Toms, and a fine piece\nof poetry it were too. Leap-frogged it, hundreds and hundreds of times,\nwhen I were a boy, I have; and so has my father and grandfather afore\nme; and why not my sons, and my grandsons too, when perhaps my own\nstandeth 'longside of 'un? I won't believe a word of it, but what thic\nold ancient stone were smashed up a' purpose, by order of Passon\nPenniloe. Tell 'e what, Doctor, thic there channging of every mortial\nthing, just for the sake of channging, bain't the right way for to fetch\nfolks to church; 'cordin' at least to my mind. Why do us go to church?\nWhy, because can't help it; 'long of wives and children, when they\ncomes, and lookin' out for 'un, when the children was ourselves. Turn\nthe bottom up, sir, and what be that but custom, same as one generation\nrequireth from another? And to put new patches on it, and be proud of\nthem, is the same thing as tinker did to wife's ham-boiler--drawed the\nrivets out, and made 'un leak worse than ever. Not another shilling will\nthey patchers get from me.\"\n\nFarmer Steve sat down in his saddle, and his red waistcoat settled down\nupon the pommel. His sturdy cob also laid down his ears, and stubborn\nBritish sentiment was in every line of both of them.\n\n\"Well, I won't pretend to say about the other matters;\" said Fox, who as\nan Englishman could allow for obstinacy. \"But, Farmer, I am sure that\nyou are wrong about the tombstone. Parson did not like it, and no\nwonder. But he is not the man to do things crookedly. He would have\nmoved it openly, or not at all. It was quite as much an accident, as if\nyour horse put his foot upon a nut and cracked it.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, well, sir, we has our own opinions. Oh, you have paid the\npike for me! Thank 'e, Doctor. I'll pay yours, next time we come this\nway together.\"\n\nThe story of the tombstone war simply this. John Toms, a rollicking\nCavalier of ancient Devonshire lineage, had lived and died at\nPerlycross, nearly two centuries agone. His grave was towards the great\nsouthern porch, and there stood his headstone large and bold,\nconfronting the faithful at a corner where two causeways met. Thus every\nworshipper, who entered the House of Prayer by its main approach, was\ninvited to reflect upon the fine qualities of this gentleman, as\nrecorded in large letters. To a devout mind this might do no harm; but\nall Perlycross was not devout, and many a light thought was suggested,\nor perhaps an untimely smile produced, by this too sprightly memorial.\n\"A spirited epitaph that, sir,\" was the frequent remark of visitors.\n\"But scarcely conceived in a proper spirit,\" was the Parson's general\nreply.\n\nThe hideous western gallery, the parish revel called the Fair, and this\nunseemly tombstone, had been sore tribulations to the placed mind of\nPenniloe; and yet he durst not touch that stone, sacred not to memory\nonly, but to vested rights, and living vein of local sentiment. However\nthe fates were merciful.\n\n\"Very sad accident this morning, sir. I do hope you will try to forgive\nus, Mr. Penniloe,\" said Robson Adney, the manager of the works, one fine\nOctober morning, and he said it with a stealthy wink; \"seven of our\nchaps have let our biggest scaffold-pole, that red one, with a butt as\nbig as a milestone, roll off their clumsy shoulders, and it has smashed\npoor Squire Toms' old tombstone into a thousand pieces. Never read a\nword of it again, sir--such a sad loss to the churchyard! But quite an\naccident, sir, you know; purely a casual accident.\"\n\nThe Curate looked at him, but he \"smiled none\"--as another tombstone\nstill expresses it; and if charity compelled Mr. Penniloe to believe\nhim, gratitude enforced another view; for Adney well knew his dislike of\nthat stone, and was always so eager to please him.\n\nBut that every one who so desires may judge for himself, whether Farmer\nSteve was right, or Parson Penniloe, here are the well-remembered lines\nthat formed the preface to Divine worship in the parish of Perlycross.\n\n\n     \"'Halloa! who lieth here?'\n       'I, old Squire Jan Toms.'\n     'What dost lack?' 'A tun of beer,\n       For a tipple with them fantoms.'\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\n\nTHE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.\n\n\n\"Boys, here's a noise!\"\n\nSergeant Jakes strode up and down the long schoolroom on Friday morning,\nflapping his empty sleeve, and swinging that big cane with the tuberous\njoints, whose taste was none too saccharine. That well-known\nejaculation, so expressive of stern astonishment, had for the moment its\ndue effect. Curly heads were jerked back, elbows squared, sniggers were\nhushed, the munch of apples (which had been as of milching kine) stuck\nfast, or was shunted into bulging cheek; never a boy seemed capable of\ndreaming that there was any other boy in the world besides himself.\nScratch of pens, and grunts of mental labour, were the only sounds in\nthis culmination of literature, known as \"Copy-exercise.\" As Achilles,\nthough reduced to a ghost, took a longer stride at the prowess of his\nson; and as deep joys, on a similar occasion, pervaded Latona's silent\nbreast; even so High-Jarks sucked the top of his cane, and felt that he\nhad not lived in vain. There are many men still hearty--though it is so\nlong ago--who have led a finer life, through that man's higher culture.\n\nBut presently--such is the nature of human nature, in its crude\nprobation--the effect of that noble remonstrance waned. Silence (which\nis itself a shadow, cast by death upon life perhaps) began to\nflicker--as all dulness should--with the play of small ideas moving it.\nLittle timid whispers, a cane's length below the breath, and with the\nheart shuffling out of all participation; and then a tacit grin that was\nafraid to move the molars, and then a cock of eye, that was intended to\ninvolve (when a bigger eye was turned away) its mighty owner; and then a\nclink of marbles in a pocket down the leg; and then a downright joke, of\nsuch very subtle humour, that it stole along the bench through funnel'd\nhands; and then alas, a small boy of suicidal levity sputtered out a\nlaugh, which made wiser wigs stand up!\n\nHis crime was only deepened by ending in sham cough; and sad to say, the\nvery boy who had made the fatal joke (instead of being grateful for\nreckless approbation) stood up and pointed an unmanly finger at him. The\nSergeant's keen eye was upon them both; and a tremble ran along the oak,\nthat bore many tempting aptitudes for the vindication of ethics. But the\nSergeant bode his time. His sense of justice was chivalrous. Let the big\nboy make another joke.\n\n\"Boys, here's a noise, again!\"\n\nThose who have not had the privilege of the Sergeant's lofty discipline\ncan never understand--far less convey--the significance of his second\nshout. It expressed profound amazement, horror at our fallen state,\nincredulity of his own ears, promptitude to redress the wrong, and yet a\npathetic sorrow at the impending grim necessity. The boys knew well that\nhis second protest never ascended to heaven in vain; and the owners of\ntender quarters shrank, and made ready to slide beneath the protection\nof their bench. Other boys, with thick corduroys, quailed for the\nmoment, and closed their mouths; but what mouth was ever closed\npermanently, by the opening of another?\n\n\"Now you shall have it, boys,\" the Sergeant thundered, as the uproar\nwaxed beyond power of words. \"Any boy slipping out of stroke shall have\ndouble cuts for cowardice. Stop the ends up. All along both rows of\nbenches; I am coming, I am coming!\"\n\n\"Oh sir, please sir, 'twadn' me, sir! 'Twor all along o' Bill Cornish,\nsir.\"\n\nHe had got this trimmer by the collar, and his cane swung high in air,\nwhen the door was opened vigorously, and a brilliant form appeared.\nBrilliant, less by its own merits, than by brave embellishment, as\nbehoves a youth ascending stairs of state from page to footman, and\nmounting upward, ever upward, to the vinous heights of Butlerhood. For\nthis was Bob Cornish, Bill's elder brother; and he smiled at the terrors\nof the hurtling cane, compulsive but a year ago, of tears.\n\nWith a dignity already imbibed from Binstock, this young man took off\nhis hat, and employing a spare slate as a tray, presented a letter with\na graceful bow. He was none too soon, but just in time. The weapon of\noutraged law came down, too lightly to dust a jacket; and the smiter,\nwonder-smitten, went to a desk, and read as follows.\n\n\"Lady Waldron will be much obliged if Sergeant Jakes will come\nimmediately in the vehicle sent with the bearer of this letter. Let no\nengagement forbid this. Mr. Penniloe has kindly consented to it.\"\n\nThe roof resounded with shouts of joy, instead of heavy wailing, as the\nSergeant at once dismissed the school; and in half an hour he entered\nthe business-room at Walderscourt, and there found the lady of the\nhouse, looking very resolute, and accompanied by her daughter.\n\n\"Soldier Jakes will take a chair. See that the door is closed, my\nchild, and no persons lingering near it. Now, Inez, will you say to this\nbrave soldier of your father's regiment, what we desire him to\nundertake, if he will be so faithful; for the benefit of his Colonel's\nfamily; also for the credit of this English country.\"\n\nThis was clever of my lady. She knew that the veteran's liking was not\nparticularly active for herself, or any of the Spanish nation; but that\nhe had transferred his love and fealty of so many years, to his\nOfficer's gentle daughter. Any request from Nicie would be almost as\nsacred a command to him, as if it had come from her father. He stood up,\nmade a low bow followed by a military salute, and gazed at the sweet\nface he loved so well.\n\n\"It is for my dear father's sake; and I am as sure as he himself would\nbe,\" Miss Waldron spoke with tears in her eyes, and a sad smile on her\nlips that would have moved a heart much harder than this veteran's,\n\"that you will not refuse to do us a great, a very great service, if you\ncan. And we have nobody we can trust like you; because you are so true,\nand brave.\"\n\nThe Sergeant rose again, and made another bow even deeper than the\nformer one; but instead of touching his grizzled locks he laid his one\nhand on his heart; and although by no means a gushing man, he found it\nimpossible to prevent a little gleam, like the upshot of a well,\nquivering under his ferny brows.\n\n\"We would not ask you even so,\" continued Nicie, with a grateful glance,\n\"if it were not that you know the place, and perhaps may find some\npeople there still living to remember you. When my father lay wounded at\nthe house of my grandfather, and was in great danger of his life, you,\nbeing also disabled for a time, were allowed at his request to remain\nwith him, and help him. Will you go to that place again, to do us a\nservice no one else can do?\"\n\n\"To the end of the world, Miss, without asking why. But the Lord have\nmercy on all them boys! Whatever will they do without me?\"\n\n\"We will arrange about all that, with Mr. Penniloe's consent. If that\ncan be managed, will you go, at once, and at any inconvenience to\nyourself?\"\n\n\"No ill-convenience shall stop me, Miss. If I thought of that twice, I\nshould be a deserter, afore the lines of the enemy. To be of the least\nbit of use to you, is an honour as well as a duty to me.\"\n\n\"I thought that you would; I was sure that you would.\" Inez gave a\nglance of triumph at her less trustful mother. \"And what makes us hurry\nyou so, is the chance that has suddenly offered for your passage. We\nheard this morning, by an accident almost, that a ship is to sail from\nTopsham to-morrow, bound direct for Cadiz. Not a large ship, but a\nfast-sailing vessel--a schooner I think they call it, and the Captain is\none of Binstock's brothers. You would get there in half the time it\nwould take to go to London, and wait about for passage, and then come\nall down the Channel. And from Cadiz you can easily get on. You know a\nlittle Spanish, don't you?\"\n\n\"Not reg'lar, Miss. But it will come back again. I picked up just enough\nfor this--I couldn't understand them much; but I could make them look as\nif they understanded me.\"\n\n\"That is quite sufficient. You will have letters to three or four\npersons who are settled there, old servants of my grandfather. We cannot\ntell which of them may be alive, but may well hope that some of them are\nso. The old house is gone, I must tell you that. After all the troubles\nof the war, there was not enough left to keep it up with.\"\n\n\"That grand old house, Miss, with the pillars, and the carrots, and the\narches, the same as in a picture! And everybody welcome; and you never\nknew if there was fifty, or a hundred in it----\"\n\n\"Sergeant, you describe it well;\" Lady Waldron interrupted. \"There are\nno such mansions in this country. Alas, it is gone from us for ever,\nbecause we loved our native land too well!\"\n\n\"Not only that,\" said the truthful Inez; \"but also because the young\nCount, as you would call him, has wasted the relics of his patrimony.\nAnd now I will explain to you the reasons for our asking this great\nservice of you.\"\n\nThe veteran listened with close attention, and no small astonishment, to\nthe young lady's clear account of that great public lottery, and the\ngorgeous prize accruing on the death of Sir Thomas Waldron. This was\nenough to tempt a ruined man to desperate measures; and Jakes had some\nknowledge in early days of the young Count's headstrong character. But\nif it should prove so, if he were guilty of the crime which had caused\nso much distress and such prolonged unhappiness, yet his sister could\nnot bear that the sordid motive should be disclosed, at least in this\npart of the world. For the sake of others, it would be needful to\ndenounce the culprit; but if the detection were managed well, no motive\nneed be assigned at all. Let every one form his own conclusion. Spanish\npapers, and Spanish news, came very sparely to Devonshire; and the\nEnglish public would be sure (in ignorance of that financial scheme,\nwhose result supplied the temptation) to ascribe the assault upon\nProtestant rites to Popish contempt and bigotry.\n\n\"I should tell the whole, if I had to decide it;\" said Nicie with the\ncandour and simplicity of youth. \"If he has done it, for the sake of\nnasty money, let everybody know what he has done it for.\"\n\nBut the Sergeant shook his head, and quite agreed with Lady Waldron. The\nworld was quite quick enough at bad constructions, without receiving\nthem ready-made.\n\n\"Leave busy-bodies to do their own buzzing;\" was his oracular\nsuggestion. \"'Tis a grand old family, even on your mother's side, Miss;\"\nNicie smiled a little, as her mother stared at this new comparative\nestimate. \"And what odds to our clodhoppers what they do? A Don don't\nlook at things the same as a dung-carter; and it takes a man who knows\nthe world to make allowance for him. The Count may have done it, mind. I\nwon't say no, until such time as I can prove it. But after all, 'tis\ncomforting to think that it was so, compared to what we all was afraid\nof. Why, the dear old Colonel would be as happy as a King, in the place\nhe was so nigh going to after the battle of Barosa; looking down over\nthe winding of the river, and the moon among the orange-trees, where he\nwas a' making love!\"\n\n\"Hush!\" whispered Nicie, as her mother turned away, with a trembling in\nher throat; and the old man saw that the memory of the brighter days had\nbrought the shadows also.\n\n\"Saturday to-morrow. Boys will do very well, till Monday;\" he came out\nwith this abruptly, to cover his confusion. \"By that time, please God, I\nshall be in the Bay of Biscay. This is what I'll do, Miss, if it suits\nyou and my lady. I'll come again to-night at nine o'clock, with my kit\nslung tidy, and not a word to anybody. Then I can have the letters,\nMiss, and my last orders. Ship sails at noon to-morrow, name of\n_Montilla_. Mail-coach to Exeter passes White Post, a little after\nhalf-past ten to-night. Be aboard easily, afore daylight. No, Miss,\nthank you, I shan't want no money. Passage paid to and fro. Old soldier\nalways hath a shot in the locker.\"\n\n\"As if we should let you go, like that! You shall not go at all, unless\nyou take this purse.\"\n\nThat evening he received his last instructions, and the next day he\nsailed in the schooner _Montilla_.\n\nEven after the many strange events, which had by this time caused such a\nwhirl of giddiness in Perlycross, that if there had been a good crack\nacross the street, every man and woman would have fallen headlong into\nit; and even before there had been leisure for people to try to tell\nthem anyhow, to one another--much less discuss them at all as they\ndeserved--this sudden break-up of the school, and disappearance of High\nJarks, would have been absolutely beyond belief, if there had not been\nscores of boys, too loudly in evidence everywhere. But when a chap,\nabout four feet high, came scudding in at any door that was open, and\nkicking at it if it dared to be shut, and then went trying every\ncupboard-lock, and making sad eyes at his mother if the key was out; and\nthen again, when he was stuffed to his buttons--which he would be, as\nsure as eggs are eggs--if the street went howling with his playful ways,\nand every corner was in a jerk with him, and no elderly lady could go\nalong without her umbrella in front of her--how was it possible for any\nmother not to feel herself guilty of more harm than good?\n\nIn a word, \"High Jarks\" was justified (as all wisdom is) of his\nchildren; and the weak-minded women, who had complained that he smote\ntoo hard, were the first to find fault with the feeble measures of his\nsubstitute, Vickary Toogood of Honiton. This gentleman came into office\non Monday, smiling in a very superior manner at his predecessor's\narrangements.\n\n\"I think we may lock up that,\" he said, pointing to the Sergeant's\nlittle tickler; \"we must be unworthy of our vocation, if we cannot\ndispense with such primitive tools.\" A burst of applause thrilled every\nbench; but knowing the boys of his parish so well, Mr. Penniloe shook\nhis head with dubious delight.\n\nAnd truly before the week was out, many a time would he murmur\nsadly--\"Oh for one hour of the Sergeant!\" as he heard the Babel of\ntongues outside, and entering saw the sprawling elbows, slouching\nshoulders, and hands in pockets, which the \"Apostle of Moral\nforce\"--_Moral farce_ was its sound and meaning here--permitted as the\nattitude of pupilage.\n\n\"Sim'th I be quite out in my reckoning;\" old Channing the Clerk had the\ncheek to say, as he met the Parson outside the school-door; \"didn't know\nit were Whit-Monday yet.\"\n\nMr. Penniloe smiled, but without rejoicing; he understood the reference\ntoo well. Upon Whit-Monday the two rival Benefit-clubs of the village\nheld their feast, and did their very utmost from bridge to Abbey, to\nout-drum, out-fife, and out-trumpet one another. Neither in his house\nwas his conscience left untouched.\n\n\"I think Lady Waldron might have sent us a better man than that is;\"\nMrs. Muggridge observed one afternoon, when the uproar came across the\nroad, and pierced the rectory windows. \"I am not sure but what little\nMaster Mike could keep better order than that is. Why, the beating of\nthe bounds was nothing to it. What could you be about, sir, to take such\na man as that?\" Thyatira had long established full privilege of censure.\n\n\"Certainly there is a noise;\" the Curate was always candid. \"But he\nbrought the very highest credentials from the Institute. We have\nscarcely given him fair trial yet. The system is new, you see, Mrs.\nMuggridge; and it must be allowed some time to take effect. No physical\nforce, the moral sense appealed to, the higher qualities educed by\nkindness, the innate preference of right promoted and strengthened by\nself-exertion, the juvenile faculties to be elevated, from the moment\nof earliest development, by a perception of their high responsibility,\nand, and--well I really forget the rest, but you perceive that it\namounts to----\"\n\n\"Row, and riot, and roaring rubbish. That's what it amounts to, sir. But\nI beg your pardon, sir; excuse my boldness, for speaking out, upon\nthings so far above me. But when they comes across the road, at ten\no'clock in the morning, to beg for a lump of raw beefsteak, by reason of\ntwo boys getting four black eyes, in fighting across the Master's desk,\nthe new system seem not Apostolical. An Apostle, about as much as I am!\nMy father was above me, and had gifts, and he put himself back, when not\nunderstanded, to the rising generation; but he never would demean\nhimself, to send for raw beefsteak for their black eyes.\"\n\n\"And I think he would have shown his common sense in that. What did you\ndo, my good Thyatira?\" Mr. Penniloe had a little spice of mischief in\nhim, which always accompanies a sub-sense of humour.\n\n\"This was what I did, sir. I looked at him, and he seemed to have been\nin the wars himself, and to have come across, perhaps to get out of\nthem, being one of the clever ones, as true Schoolmaster sayeth, and by\nthe same token not so thick of head; and he looked up at me, as if he\nwas proud of it, to take me in; while the real fighting boys look down,\nas I know by my brother who was guilty of it; and I said to him, very\nquiet like--'No steak kept here for moral-force black-eyes-boys. You go\nto Robert Jakes, the brother of a man that understands his business, and\ntell him to enter in his books, half a pound prime-cut, for four black\neyes, to the credit of Vickary Toogood.'\"\n\nIt was not only thus, but in many other ways, that the village at large\nshed painful tears (sadly warranted by the ears), and the Church looked\nwith scorn at the children straggling in, like a lot of Dissenters going\nanyhow; and the Cross at the meeting of the four main roads, which had\nbeen a fine stump for centuries, lost its proper coat of whitewash on\nCandlemas-day; and the crystal Perle itself began to be threaded with\nred from pugnacious noses. For the lesson of all history was repeated,\nthat softness universal, and unlimited concession, set off very\ngrandly, but come home with broken heads, to load their guns with\ngrapnel.\n\nAnd what could Mr. Penniloe do, when some of the worst belligerents were\nthose of his own household; upon one frontier his three pupils, and upon\nanother, Zip Tremlett? Pike, Peckover, and Mopuss, the pupils now come\nback again, were all very decent and law-abiding fellows, but had\ndrifted into a savage feud with the factory boys at the bottom of the\nvillage. As they were but three against three score, it soon became\nunsafe for them to cross Perlebridge, without securing their line of\nretreat. Of course they looked down from a lofty height upon \"cads who\nsmelled of yarn, and even worse;\" but what could moral, or even lineal\nexcellence, avail them against the huge disparity of numbers? Each of\nthem held himself a match for any three of the enemy, and they issued a\nchallenge upon that scale; but the paper-cap'd host showed no chivalry.\nOn one occasion, this noble trio held the bridge victoriously against\nthe whole force of the enemy, inflicting serious loss, and even\npreparing for a charge upon the mass. But the cowardly mass found a heap\nof road-metal, and in lack of their own filled the air with it, and the\nPennilovian heroes had begun to bite the dust, when luckily Farmer John\nrode up, and saved the little force from annihilation by slashing right\nand left through the Operative phalanx.\n\nWhen Mr. Penniloe heard of this pitched battle, he was deeply grieved;\nand sending for his pupils administered a severe rebuke to them. But\nJohn Pike's reply was a puzzler to him.\n\n\"If you please, sir, will you tell us what to do, when they fall upon\nus?\"\n\n\"Endeavour to avoid them;\" replied the Clergyman, feeling some want of\nconfidence however in his counsel.\n\n\"So we do, sir, all we can;\" Pike made answer, with the aspect of a\ndove. \"But they won't be avoided, when they think they've got enough\ncads together to lick us.\"\n\n\"I should like to know one thing,\" enquired the Hopper, striking out his\ncalves, which were now becoming of commanding size; \"are we to be called\n'Latin tay-kettles,' and 'Parson's pups,' and then do nothing but run\naway?\"\n\n\"My father says that the road is called the King's Highway;\" said\nMopuss, who was a fat boy, with great deliberation, \"because all his\nsubjects have a right to it, but no right to throw it at one another.\"\n\n\"I admit that a difficulty arises there;\" replied Mr. Penniloe as\ngravely as he could, for Mopuss was always quoting his papa, a lawyer of\nsome eminence. \"But really, my lads, we must not have any more of this.\nThere is fault upon both sides, beyond all doubt. I shall see the\nfactory manager to-morrow, and get him to warn his pugnacious band. I am\nvery unwilling to confine you to these premises; but if I hear of any\nmore pitched battles, I shall be compelled to do so, until peace has\nbeen proclaimed.\"\n\nHere again was Jakes to seek; for the fear of him lay upon the factory\nboys, as heavily as upon his own school-children. And perhaps as sore a\npoint as any was that he should have been rapt away, without full reason\nrendered.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\n\nLOYALTY.\n\n\n\"I do not consider myself at all an inquisitive man,\" Mr. Penniloe\nreflected, and here the truth was with him; \"nevertheless it is hard\nupon me to be refused almost the right to speculate upon this question.\nThey have told me that it is of the last importance, to secure this\ngreat disciplinarian--never appreciated while with us, but now deplored\nso deeply--for a special service in the south of Spain. What that\nspecial service is, I am not to know, until his return; possibly not\neven then. And Mr. Webber has no idea what the meaning of it is. But I\nknow that it has much to do--all to do, I might even say--with that\nfrightful outrage of last November--three months ago, alas, alas, and a\nsad disgrace upon this parish still! Marvellous are the visitations of\nthe Lord. Practically speaking, we know but little more of that affair\nnow, than on the day it was discovered. If it were not for one thing, I\nshould even be driven at last to Gowler's black conclusion; and my faith\nin the true love of a woman, and in the honesty of a proud brave woman\nwould be shattered, and leave me miserable. But now it is evident that\ngood and gentle Nicie is acting entirely with her mother; and to imagine\nthat she would wrong her father is impossible. Perhaps I shall even get\nfriend Gowler's hundred pounds. What a triumph that would be! To obtain\na large sum for the Service of God from an avowed--ah well, who am I to\nthink harshly of him? But the money might even be blest to himself;\nwhich is the first thing to consider. It is my duty to accept it\ntherefore, if I can only get it.\n\n\"And here again is Jemmy Fox, not behaving at all as he used to do.\nConcealing something from me--I am almost sure of it by his manner--and\ndiscussing it, I do believe, with Gronow--an intimacy that cannot be\ngood for him. I wish I could perceive more clearly, in what points I\nhave neglected my duty to the parish; for I seem to be losing hold upon\nit, which must be entirely my own fault. There must be some want of\njudgment somewhere--what else could lead to such very sad fighting? Even\nZip, a little girl, disgracing us by fighting in the streets! That at\nany rate I can stop, and will do so pretty speedily.\"\n\nThis was a lucky thought for him, because it led to action, instead of\nbrooding, into which miserable condition he might otherwise have\ndropped. And when a man too keen of conscience hauls himself across the\ncoals, the Governor of a hot place takes advantage to peep up between\nthem. Mr. Penniloe rang the bell, and begged Mrs. Muggridge to be good\nenough to send Miss Zippy to him.\n\nZip, who had grown at least two inches since the death of her\ngrandmother--not in length perhaps so much as in the height she made of\nit--came shyly into the dusky bookroom, with one of her long hands\ncrumpling the lower corner of her pinafore into her great brown eyes.\nShe knew she was going to catch it, and knew also the way to meet it,\nfor she opened the conversation with a long-drawn sob.\n\n\"Don't be frightened, my dear child;\" said the Parson with the worst of\nhis intention waning. \"I am not going to scold you much, my dear.\"\n\n\"Oh, I was so terrible afraid, you was.\" The little girl crept up close\nto him, and began to play with his buttonhole, curving her lissome\nfingers in and out, like rosebuds in a trellis, and looking down at the\nteardrops on her pinny. \"Plaise sir, I knows well enough as I desarves a\nbit of it.\"\n\n\"Then why did you do it, my dear child? But I am glad that you feel it\nto be wrong.\"\n\nThe clergyman was sitting in the deep square chair, where most of his\nsermons came to him, and he brought his calm face down a little, to\ncatch the expression of the young thing's eyes. Suddenly she threw\nherself into his arms, and kissed his lips, and cheeks, and forehead,\nand stroked his silvery hair, and burst into a passionate wail; and then\nslid down upon a footstool, and nursed his foot.\n\n\"Do 'e know why I done that?\" she whispered, looking up over his knees\nat him. \"Because there be nobody like 'e, in the heavens, or the earth,\nor the waters under the earth. Her may be as jealous as ever her\nplaiseth; but I tell 'e, I don't care a cuss.\"\n\n\"My dear little impetuous creature,\" Mr. Penniloe knew that his darling\nFay was the one defied thus recklessly; \"I am sure that you are fond of\nall of us. And to please me, as well as for much higher reasons, you\nmust never use bad words. Bad deeds too I have heard of, Zip, though I\nam not going to scold much now. But why did you get into conflict with a\nboy?\"\n\nZip pondered the meaning of these words for a moment, and then her\nconscience interpreted.\n\n\"Because he spoke bad of 'e, about the Fair.\" She crooked her quick\nfingers together as she spoke, and tore them asunder with vehemence.\n\n\"And what did you do to him? Eh Zip? Oh Zip!\"\n\n\"Nort, for to sarve 'un out, as a' desarved. Only pulled most of 's hair\nout. His moother hurned arter me; but I got inside the ge-at.\"\n\n\"A nice use indeed for my premises--to make them a refuge, after\ncommitting assault and battery! Well, what shall we come to next?\"\n\n\"Plaise sir, I want to tell 'e zummut;\" said the child, looking up very\nearnestly. \"Bain't it Perlycrass Fair, come Tuesday next?\"\n\n\"I am sorry to say that it is. A day of sad noise and uproar. Remember\nthat little Zip must not go outside the gates, that day.\"\n\n\"Nor Passon nayther;\" the child took hold of his hand, as if she were\npulling him inside the gate, for her nature was full of gestures; and\nthen she gazed at him with a sage smile of triumph--\"and Passon mustn't\ngo nayther.\"\n\nMr. Penniloe took little heed of this (though he had to think of it\nafterwards) but sent the child to have her tea, with Muggridge and the\nchildren.\n\nBut before he could set to his work in earnest, although he had\ndiscovered much to do, in came his own child, little Fay, looking round\nthe room indignantly. With her ladylike style, she was much too grand to\nadmit a suspicion of jealousy, but she smoothed her golden hair gently\nback, and just condescended to glance round the chairs. Mr. Penniloe\nsaid nothing, and feigned to see nothing, though getting a little afraid\nin his heart; for he always looked on Fay as representing her dear\nmother. He knew that the true way to learn a child's sentiments, is to\nlet them come out of their own accord. There is nothing more jealous\nthan a child, except a dog.\n\n\"Oh, I thought Darkie was here again!\" said Fay, throwing back her\nshoulders, and spinning on one leg. \"This room belongs to Darkie now\naltogether. Though I can't see what right she has to it.\"\n\nMr. Penniloe treated this soliloquy, as if he had not heard it; and went\non with his work, as if he had no time to attend to children's affairs\njust now.\n\n\"It may be right, or it may be wrong,\" said Fay, addressing the room in\ngeneral, and using a phrase she had caught up from Pike, a very great\nfavourite of hers; \"but I can't see why all the people of this house\nshould have to make way for a Gipsy.\"\n\nThis was a little too much for a father and clergyman to put up with.\n\"Fay!\" said Mr. Penniloe in a voice that made her tremble; and she came\nand stood before him, contrite and sobbing, with her head down, and both\nhands behind her back. Without raising her eyes the fair child listened,\nwhile her father spoke impressively; and then with a reckless look, she\ntendered full confession.\n\n\"Father, I know that I am very wicked, and I seem to get worse every\nday. I wish I was the Devil altogether; because then I could not get any\nworse.\"\n\n\"My little child,\" said her father with amazement; \"I can scarcely\nbelieve my ears. My gentle little Fay to use such words!\"\n\n\"Oh, _she_ thinks nothing of saying that! And you know how fond you are\nof her, papa. I thought it might make you fond of me.\"\n\n\"This must be seen to at once,\" thought Mr. Penniloe, when he had sent\nhis jealous little pet away; \"but what can I do with that poor deserted\nchild? Passionate, loving, very strong-willed, grateful, fearless,\nsensitive, inclined to be contemptuous, wonderfully quick at learning,\nshe has all the elements of a very noble woman--or of a very pitiable\nwreck. Quite unfit to be with my children, as my better judgment\npronounced at first. She ought to be under a religious, large-minded,\nfirm, but gentle woman--a lady too, or she would laugh at her. Though\nshe speaks broad Devonshire dialect herself, she detects in a moment the\nmistakes of others, and she has a lofty contempt for vulgarity. She is\nthrown by the will of God upon my hands, and I should be a coward, or a\nheartless wretch, if I shirked the responsibility. It will almost break\nher heart to go from me; but go she must for her own sake, as well as\nthat of my little ones.\"\n\n\"How are you, sir?\" cried a cheerful voice. \"I fear that I interrupt\nyou. But I knocked three or four times, and got no answer. Excuse my\ncoming in like this. Can I have a little talk with you?\"\n\n\"Certainly, Dr. Fox. I beg your pardon; but my mind was running upon\ndifficult questions. Let us have the candles, and then I am at your\nservice.\"\n\n\"Now,\" said Jemmy when they were alone again; \"I dare say you think that\nI have behaved very badly, in keeping out of your way so long.\"\n\n\"Not badly, but strangely;\" replied the Parson, who never departed from\nthe truth, even for the sake of politeness. \"I concluded that there must\nbe some reason; knowing that I had done nothing to cause it.\"\n\n\"I should rather think not. Nothing ever changes you. But it was for\nyour sake. And now I will enlighten you, as the time is so close at\nhand. It appears that you have not succeeded in abolishing the Fair.\"\n\n\"Not for this year. There were various formalities. But this will be\nthe last of those revels, I believe. The proclamation will be read on\nTuesday morning. After this year, I hope, no more carousals prolonged\nfar into the Penitential day. It will take them by surprise; but it is\nbetter so. Otherwise there would have been preparations for a revel more\nreckless, as being the last.\"\n\n\"I suppose you know, sir, what bitter offence you are giving to hundreds\nof people all around?\"\n\n\"I am sorry that it should be so. But it is my simple duty.\"\n\n\"Nothing ever stops you from your duty. But I hope you will do your duty\nto yourself and us, by remaining upon your own premises that day.\"\n\n\"Certainly not. If I did such a thing, I should seem to be frightened of\nmy own act. Please God, I shall be in the market-place, to hear the\nproclamation read, and attend to my parish-work afterwards.\"\n\n\"I know that it is useless to argue with you, sir. None of our people\nwould dare to insult you; but one cannot be sure of outsiders. At any\nrate, do keep near the village, where there are plenty to defend you.\"\n\n\"No one will touch me. I am not a hero; and I can't afford to get my new\nhat damaged. I shall remain among the civilized, unless I am called\naway.\"\n\n\"Well, that is something; though not all that I could wish. And now I\nwill tell you why I am glad, much as I dislike the Fair, that for this\nyear at least it is to be. It is a most important date to me, and I hope\nit will bring you some satisfaction also. Unless we manage very badly\nindeed, or have desperately bad luck, we shall get hold of the villains\nwho profaned your churchyard, and through them of course find the\ninstigator.\"\n\nWith this preface, Fox told his tale to Mr. Penniloe, and quite\nsatisfied him about the reasons for concealing it so long, as well as\nmade him see that it would not do to preach upon the subject yet.\n\n\"My dear young friend, no levity, if you please;\" said the Parson,\nthough himself a little, a very little, prone to it on the sly, among\npeople too solid to stumble. \"I draw my lessons from the past, or\npresent. Better men than myself insist upon the terrors of the future,\nand scare people from looking forward. But our Church, according to my\nviews, is a cheerful and progressive mother, encouraging her children,\nand fortifying----\"\n\n\"Quite so;\" said Jemmy Fox, anticipating too much on that head; \"but she\nwould not fortify us with such a Lenten _fare_ as this. Little pun, sir,\nnot so very bad. However, to business. I meant to have told you nothing\nof this till Monday or Tuesday, until it struck me that you would be\nhurt perhaps, if the notice were so very short. The great point is that\nnot a word of our intentions should get abroad, or the rogues might make\nthemselves more scarce than rogues unluckily are allowed to be. This is\nwhy we have put off our application to Mockham, until Tuesday morning;\nand even then we shall lay our information as privately as possible. But\nwe must have a powerful posse, when we proceed to arrest them; for one\nof the men, as I told you, is of tremendous bulk and stature, and the\nother not a weakling. And perhaps the third, the fellow they come to\nmeet, will show fight on their behalf. We must allow no chance of\nescape, and possibly they may have fire-arms. We shall want at least\nfour constables, as well as Gronow, and myself.\"\n\n\"But all good subjects of the King are bound to assist, if called upon\nin the name of His Majesty, at the execution of a warrant.\"\n\n\"So they are; but they never do it, even when there is no danger. In the\npresent case, they would boldly run away. And more than that, by ten\no'clock on Fair-night, how will His Majesty's true lieges be? Unable to\nkeep their own legs, I fear. The trouble will be to keep our own force\nsober. But Gronow has undertaken to see to that. If he can do it, we\nshall be all right. We may fairly presume that the enemy also will not\nbe too steady upon their pins. The only thing I don't like is that a man\nof Gronow's age should be in the scuffle. He has promised to keep in the\nbackground; but if things get lively, can I trust him?\"\n\n\"I should think it very doubtful. He looks an uncommonly resolute man.\nIf there is a conflict, he will be in it. But do you think that the big\nman Harvey really is our Zippy's father? If so, I am puzzled by what\nhis mother said; and I think the old lady was truthful. So far as I\ncould understand what she said, her son had never been engaged in any of\nthe shocking work we hear so much of now. And she would not have denied\nit from any sense of shame, for she confessed to even worse things, on\nthe part of other sons.\"\n\n\"She may not have known it. He has so rarely been at home. A man of that\nsize would have been notorious throughout the parish, if he had ever\nlived at home; whereas nobody knows him, not even Joe Crang, who knows\nevery man and horse for miles around. But the Whetstone people are a\ntribe apart, and keep all their desolate region to themselves.\"\n\n\"The district is extra-parochial, a sort of No-man's land almost,\" Mr.\nPenniloe answered thoughtfully. \"An entire parish intervenes between\ntheir hill and Hagdon; so that I cannot go among them, without seeming\nto intrude upon a neighbour's duties. Otherwise it is very sad to think\nthat a colony almost of heathens should be permitted in the midst of us.\nI hear that there is a new landowner now, coming from your father's part\nof the country, who claims seigniorial rights over them, which they\nintend to resist with all their might.\"\n\n\"To be sure. Sir Henry Haggerstone is the man, a great friend of mine,\nand possibly something nearer before long. He cares not a pin for the\nmoney; but he is not the man to forego his rights, especially when they\nare challenged. I take a great interest in those people. Sir Henry\npromised me an introduction, through his steward, or whoever it is; and\nbut for this business I should have gone over. But as these two fellows\nhave been among them, I thought it wiser to keep away. I intend to know\nmore of them, when this is over. I rather like fellows who refuse to\npay.\"\n\n\"You have plenty of experience of them, doctor, without going over to\nthe Whetstone. Would that we had a few gratuitous Church-builders, as\nwell as a gratuitous doctor in this parish! But I sadly fear that your\nservices will be too much in demand after this arrest. You should have\nat least six constables, if our people will not help you. Supposing\nthat the Whetstone men are there, would they not attempt a rescue?\"\n\n\"No sir; they will not be there; it is not their custom. I am ashamed,\nas it is, to take four men against two, and would not, except for the\ngreat importance of it. But I am keeping you too long. I shall make a\npoint of beholding you no more, until Wednesday morning; except of\ncourse in church on Sunday. You must be kept out of it altogether. It is\nnot for me to tell you what to do; but I trust that you will not add to\nour anxieties, by appearing at all in the matter. Your busiest time of\nthe year is at hand; and I scarcely know whether I have done right, in\nworrying you at all about this affair.\"\n\n\"Truly the time is appointed now for conflict with the unseen powers,\nrather than those of our own race. But why are we told to gird our\nloins--of which succincture the Spencer is expressive, and therefore\ncurtly clerical--unless we are also to withstand evil-doers, even in the\nmarket-place? Peace is a thing that we all desire; but no man must be\nselfish of it. If every man stuck to his own corner only, would there\never be a dining-table? Be not surprised then, Master Jemmy Fox, if I\nshould appear upon the warlike scene. As the Statesmen of the age\nsay--when they don't know what to say--I reserve my right of action.\"\n\nFox was compelled to be satisfied with this because he could get no\nbetter. Yet he found it hard to be comfortable about the now urgent\noutlook. Beyond any doubt, he must go through with the matter in hand,\nand fight it well out. But where would he be, if the battle left him,\nwith two noble heroes disabled, and both of them beyond the heroic time\nof life. As concerned himself, he was quite up for the fight, and\nregarded the prospect with pleasure, as behoves a young man, who\nrequires a little change, and has a lady-love who will rejoice in his\nfeats. Moreover he knew that he was very quick of foot, and full of\nnimble dodges; but these elderly men could not so skip away, even if\ntheir dignity allowed it. After much grim meditation, when he left the\nrectory, he made up his mind to go straight to Squire Mockham; and\nalthough it was a doubtful play of cards, to consult thus informally\nthe Justice, before whom the information was soon to be laid, it seemed\nto him, on the whole, to be the proper course. On Tuesday it would be\ntoo late to receive any advice upon the subject.\n\nBut Mr. Mockham made no bones of it. Whether he would grant the warrant\nor not, was quite another question, and must depend upon the formal\ndepositions when received. The advice that he gave was contingent only\nupon the issue of the warrant, as to which he could say nothing yet. But\nhe did not hesitate, as the young man's friend, to counsel him about his\nown share in the matter.\n\n\"Keep all your friends out of it. Let none of them be there. The\nexecution of a warrant is the duty of the Authorities, not of amateurs\nand volunteers. Even you yourself should not appear, unless it be just\nto identify; though afterwards you must do so, of course, when the\ncharge comes to be heard. Better even that criminals should escape, than\nthat non-official persons should take the business on themselves. As a\nmagistrate's son, you must know this.\"\n\n\"That is all very well, in an ordinary case,\" said Fox, who had got a\ngreat deal more than he wanted. \"But here it is of such extreme\nimportance to get to the bottom of this matter; and if they escape,\nwhere are we?\"\n\n\"All very true. But if you apply to the law, you must let the law do its\nown work, and in its own way, though it be not perfect. All you can do,\nis to hope for the best.\"\n\n\"And probably get the worst,\" said Jemmy, with a grin of resignation.\n\"But I suppose I may be at hand, and ready to give assistance, if called\nupon?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" answered Mr. Mockham, rubbing his hands gently; \"that is\nthe privilege of every subject, though not claimed very greedily.\nBy-the-by, I was told that there is to be some sort of wrestling at your\nFair this year. Have you heard anything about it?\"\n\n\"Well, perhaps a little.\" The young man looked slyly at the Magistrate,\nfor one of the first things he had heard was that Mockham had started\nthe scheme by giving ten guineas towards the prize-fund. \"Among other\nthings I heard that Polwarth is coming, the Cornish champion, as they\ncall him.\"\n\n\"And he holds the West of England belt. It is too bad,\" said the\nMagistrate, \"that we should have no man to redeem it. When I was a boy,\nwe should all have been mad, if the belt had gone over the border long.\nBut who is there now? The sport is decaying, and fisticuffs (far more\ndegrading work) are ousting it altogether. I think you went to see the\nplay last year.\"\n\n\"I just looked in at it, once or twice. It did not matter very much to\nme, as a son of Somerset; but it must have been very grievous to a true\nDevonian, to see Cornwall chucking his countrymen about, like a lot of\nwax-headed ninepins. And no doubt he will do the same thing this year.\nYou can't help it--can you, Squire?\"\n\n\"Don't be too sure of that, my friend. A man we never heard of has\nchallenged for the belt, on behalf of Devon. He will not play in the\nstandards, but have best of three backs with the Cornishman, for the\nbelt and a special prize raised by subscription. When I was a lad I used\nto love to see it, ay, and I knew all the leading men. Why, all the\ngreat people used to go to see it then. The Lord Lieutenant of the\ncounty would come down from Westminster for any great match; and as for\nMagistrates--well, the times are changed.\"\n\n\"You need not have asked me the news, I see. To know all about it, I\nmust come to you. I should have been glad to see something of it, if it\nis to be such a big affair. But that will be impossible on account of\nthis job. Good night, sir. Twelve o'clock, I think you said, will suit\nfor our application?\"\n\n\"Yes, and to stop malicious mouths--for they get up an outcry, if one\nknows anybody--I shall get Sir Edwin Sanford to join me. He is in the\nCommission for Somerset too; and so we can arrange it--if issued at all,\nto hold good across the border.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV.\n\nA WRESTLING BOUT.\n\n\nValentine's Day was on Sunday that year, and a violent gale from the\nsouth and west set in before daylight, and lasted until the evening,\nwithout bringing any rain. Anxiety was felt about the Chancel roof,\nwhich had only been patched up temporarily, and waterproofed with thick\ntarpaulins; for the Exeter builders had ceased work entirely during that\nDecember frost, and as yet had not returned to it. To hurry them, while\nengaged elsewhere, would not have been just, or even wise, inasmuch as\nthey might very fairly say, \"let us have a little balancing of books\nfirst, if you please.\"\n\nHowever, the old roof withstood the gale, being sheltered from the worst\nof it, and no further sinking of the wall took place; but at the Abbey,\nsome fifty yards eastward, a very sad thing came to pass. The\nsouth-western corner and the western end (the most conspicuous part\nremaining) were stripped, as if by a giant's rip-hook, of all their dark\nmantle of ivy. Like a sail blown out of the bolt-ropes, away it all went\nbodily, leaving the white flint rough and rugged, and staring like a\nsuburban villa of the most choice effrontery. The contrast with the\nremainder of the ruins and the old stone church was hideous; and Mr.\nPenniloe at once resolved to replace and secure afresh as much of the\nfallen drapery as had not been shattered beyond hope of life. Walter\nHaddon very kindly offered to supply the ladders, and pay half the cost;\nfor the picturesque aspect of his house was ruined by this bald\nbackground. This job was to be put in hand on Thursday; but worse things\nhappened before that day.\n\n\"Us be going to have a bad week of it,\" old Channing, the clerk,\nobserved on Monday, as he watched the four vanes on the tower (for his\neyes were almost as keen as ever) and the woodcock feathers on the\nwestern sky; \"never knowed a dry gale yet, but were follered by a wet\none twice as bad; leastways, if a' coom from the Dartmoor mountains.\"\n\nHowever, things seemed right enough on Tuesday morning, to people who\nseldom think much of the sky; and the rustics came trooping in to the\nFair, as brave as need be, and with all their Sunday finery. A prettier\nlot of country girls no Englishman might wish, and perhaps no other man\nmight hope to see, than the laughing, giggling, blushing, wondering,\nsimpering, fluttering, or bridling maidens, fresh from dairy, or churn,\nor linhay, but all in very bright array, with love-knots on their\nbreasts, and lavender in their pocket-handkerchiefs. With no depressing\nelegance perhaps among them, and no poetic sighing for impossible\nideals; and probably glancing backwards, more than forwards on the path\nof life, because the rule and the practice is, for the lads of the party\nto walk behind.\n\nLouts are these, it must be acknowledged, if looked at from too high a\npoint; and yet, in their way, not by any means so low, as a topper on\nthe high horse, with astral spurs, and a banner of bad Latin, might\ncondemn them for to be. If they are clumsy, and awkward, and sheepish,\nand can only say--\"Thank 'e, sir! Veyther is quite well,\" in answer to\n\"How are you to-day, John?\"--some of it surely is by reason of a very\nnoble quality, now rarer than the great auk's egg; and known, while it\nwas a noun still substantive, as modesty. But there they were, and\nplenty of them, in the year 1836; and they meant to spend their money in\ngood fairing, if so be their girls were kind.\n\nMr. Penniloe had a lot of good heart in him; and when he came out to\nstand by the bellman, and trumpeter who thrilled the market-place, his\ncommon sense, and knowledge of the darker side, had as much as they\ncould do to back him up against the impression of the fair young faces,\nthat fell into the dumps, at his sad decree. The strong evil-doers were\nnot come yet, their time would not begin till the lights began to flare,\nand the dark corners hovered with temptation. Silence was enjoined three\ntimes by ding-dong of bell and blare of trump, and thrice the fatal\ndocument was read with stern solemnity and mute acceptance of every\ncreature except ducks, whom nothing short of death can silence, and\nscarcely even that when once their long valves quiver with the elegiac\nstrain.\n\nThe trumpeter from Exeter, with scarlet sash and tassel, looked down\nfrom an immeasurable height upon the village bellman, and a fiddler in\nthe distance, and took it much amiss that he should be compelled to time\nhis sonorous blasts by the tinkle tinkle of old nunks.\n\n\"Truly, I am sorry,\" said the Curate to himself, while lads and lasses,\ndecked with primrose, and the first white violets, whispered sadly to\none another--\"no more fairing after this\"--\"I am sorry that it should be\nneedful to stop all these innocent enjoyments.\"\n\n\"Then why did you send for me, sir?\" asked the trumpeter rather\nsavagely, as one who had begged at the rectory for beer, to medicate his\nlips against the twang of brass, but won not a drop from Mrs. Muggridge.\n\nSuddenly there came a little volley of sharp drops--not of the liquid he\ndesired--dashed into the trumpeter's red face, and against the back of\nthe Parson's hat--the first skit of rain, that seemed rather to rise, as\nif from a blow-pipe, than fall from the clouds. Mr. Penniloe hastened to\nhis house close by, for the market-place was almost in a straight line\nwith the school, and taking his old gingham umbrella, set off alone for\na hamlet called Southend, not more than half a mile from the village.\nAlthough not so learned in the weather as his clerk, he could see that\nthe afternoon was likely to prove wet, and the longer he left it the\nworse it would be, according to all indications. Without any thought of\nadversaries, he left the village at a good brisk pace, to see an old\nparishioner of whose illness he had heard.\n\nCrossing a meadow on his homeward course he observed that the footpath\nwas littered here and there with strips and patches of yellow osier\npeel, as if, since he had passed an hour or so ago, some idle fellow had\nbeen \"whittling\" wands from a withy-bed which was not far off. For a\nmoment he wondered what this could mean; but not a suspicion crossed his\nmind of a rod in preparation for his own back.\n\nAlas, too soon was this gentleman enlightened. The lonely footpath came\nsideways into a dark and still more lonesome lane, deeply sunk between\ntangled hedges, except where a mouldering cob wall stood, sole relic of\na worn-out linhay. Mr. Penniloe jumped lightly from the treddled stile\ninto the mucky and murky lane, congratulating himself upon shelter\nhere, for a squally rain was setting in; but the leap was into a den of\nwolves.\n\nFrom behind the cob wall, with a yell, out rushed four hulking fellows,\nlong of arm and leg, still longer of the weapons in their hands. Each of\nthem bore a white withy switch, flexible, tough, substantial, seemly\ninstrument for a pious verger--but what would pious vergers be doing\nhere, and why should their faces retire from view? Each of them had tied\nacross his most expressive, and too distinctive part, a patch of white\nmuslin, such as imparts the sweet sense of modesty to a chamber-window;\nbut modesty in these men was small.\n\nThree of them barred the Parson's road, while the fourth cut off his\ncommunications in the rear; but even so did he not perceive the full\natrocity of their intentions. To him they appeared to be inditing of\nsome new form of poaching, or some country game of skill perhaps, or\nthese might be rods of measurement.\n\n\"Allow me to pass, my friends,\" he said; \"I shall not interfere with\nyour proceedings. Be good enough to let me go by.\"\n\n\"Us has got a little bit o' zummat,\" said the biggest of them, with his\nlegs astraddle, \"to goo with 'e, Passon, and to 'baide with 'e a bit. A\nchoice bit of fairing, zort o' peppermint stick, or stick lickerish.\"\n\n\"I am not a fighting man; but if any man strikes me, let him beware for\nhimself. I am not to be stopped on a public highway, like this.\"\n\nAs Mr. Penniloe spoke, he unwisely closed his umbrella, and holding it\nas a staff of defence, advanced against the enemy.\n\nOne step was all the advance he made, for ere he could take another, he\nwas collared, and tripped up, and cast forward heavily upon his\nforehead. There certainly was a great stone in the mud; but he never\nknew whether it was that, or a blow from a stick, or even the ebony knob\nof his own umbrella, that struck him so violently as he fell; but the\neffect was that he lay upon his face, quite stunned, and in danger of\nbeing smothered in the muck.\n\n\"Up with's coat-tails! Us'll dust his jacket. Ring the bull on 'un--one,\ntwo, dree, vour.\"\n\nThe four stood round, with this very fine Christian, ready--as the\nChristian faith directs, for weak members, not warmed up with it,--ready\nto take everything he could not help; and the four switches hummed in\nthe air with delight, like the thirsty swords of Homer; when a rush as\nof many winds swept them back to innocence. A man of great stature, and\nwith blazing eyes, spent no words upon them, but lifted up the biggest\nwith a chuck below his chin, which sent him sprawling into the ditch,\nwith a broken jaw, then took another by the scruff of his small clothes,\nand hefted him into a dog-rose stool, which happened to stand on the top\nof the hedge with shark's teeth ready for their business; then he leaped\nover the prostrate Parson, but only smote vacant air that time. \"The\ndevil, the devil, 'tis the devil himself!\" cried the two other fellows,\ncutting for their very lives.\n\n\"Reckon, I were not a breath too soon;\" said the man who had done it, as\nhe lifted Mr. Penniloe, whose lips were bubbling and nose clotted up;\n\"why, they would have killed 'e in another minute, my dear. D--d if I\nbain't afeared they has done it now.\"\n\nThat the clergyman should let an oath pass unrebuked, would have been\nproof enough to any one who knew him that it never reached his mind. His\nsilver hair was clogged with mud, and his gentle face begrimed with it,\nand his head fell back between the big man's knees, and his blue eyes\nrolled about without seeing earth or heaven.\n\n\"That doiled Jemmy Fox, we wants 'un now. Never knowed a doctor come,\nwhen a' were wanted. Holloa, you be moving there, be you? You dare stir,\nyou murderer!\" It was one of the men lately pitched into the hedge; but\nhe only groaned again, at that great voice.\n\n\"Do 'e veel a bit better now, my dear? I've a girt mind to kill they two\nhosebirds in the hedge; and what's more, I wull, if 'e don't came round\npretty peart.\"\n\nAs if to prevent the manslaughter threatened, the Parson breathed\nheavily once or twice, and tried to put his hand to his temples; and\nthen looked about with a placid amazement.\n\n\"You 'bide there, sir, for a second,\" said the man, setting him\ncarefully upon a dry bank with his head against an ash-tree. \"Thy soul\nshall zee her desire of thine enemies, as I've a'read when I waz a\nlittle buy.\"\n\nTo verify this promise of Holy Writ, he took up the stoutest of the\nwhite switches, and visiting the ditch first, and then the hedge-trough,\nleft not a single accessible part of either of those ruffians without a\nweal upon it as big as his thumb, and his thumb was not a little one.\nThey howled like a couple of pigs at the blacksmith's, when he slips the\nring into their noses red-hot; and it is lawful to hope that they felt\ntheir evil deeds.\n\n\"T'other two shall have the very same, bumbai; I knows where to put\nhands on 'em both;\" said the operator, pointing towards the village; and\nit is as well to mention that he did it.\n\n\"Now, sir, you come along of I.\" He cast away the fourth rod, having\nelicited their virtues, and taking Mr. Penniloe in his arms, went\nsteadily with him to the nearest house. This stood alone in the\noutskirts of the village; and there two very good old ladies lived, with\na handsome green railing in front of them.\n\nThese, after wringing their hands for some minutes, enabled Mr. Penniloe\nto wash his face and head, and gave him some red currant wine, and sent\ntheir child of all work for Mrs. Muggridge. Meanwhile the Parson began\nto take a more distinct view of the world again, his first emotion being\nanxiety about his Sunday beaver, which he had been wearing in honour of\nthe Proclamation--the last duty it was ever destined to discharge. But\nthe \"gigantic individual,\" as the good ladies called him, was nowhere to\nbe seen, when they mustered courage to persuade one another to peep\noutside the rails.\n\nBy this time the weather was becoming very bad. Everybody knows how a\ngreat gale rises; not with any hurry, or assertion of itself, (as a\nlittle squall does, that is limited for time) but with a soft\nhypocritical sigh, and short puffs of dissimulation. The solid great\nstorm, that gets up in the south, and means to make every tree in\nEngland bow, to shatter the spray on the Land's-end cliffs while it\nshakes all the towers of London, begins its advance without any broad\nrush, but with many little ticklings of the space it is to sweep. A\ntrumpery frolic where four roads meet, a woman's umbrella turned inside\nout, a hat tossed into a horse-pond perhaps, a weather-cock befooled\ninto chace of head with tail, and a clutch of big raindrops sheafed into\nthe sky and shattered into mist again--these, and a thousand other\nlittle pranks and pleasantries, are as the shrill admonitions of the\nfife, in the vanguard of the great invasion of the heavens.\n\nBut what cares a man, with his money in his pockets, how these larger\nthings are done? And even if his money be yet to seek, still more shall\nit preponderate. A tourney of wrestlers for cash and great glory was\ncrowding the courtyard of the _Ivy-bush_ with every man who could raise\na shilling. A steep roof of rick-cloth and weatherproof canvas,\nsupported on a massive ridge-pole would have protected the enclosure\nfrom any ordinary storm; but now the tempestuous wind was tugging,\nwhistling, panting, shrieking, and with great might thundering, and the\nviolent rain was pelting, like the rattle of pebbles on the Chessil\nbeach, against the strained canvas of the roof; while the rough hoops of\ncandles inside were swinging, with their crops of guttering tallow\nwelted, like sucked stumps of Asparagus. Nevertheless the spectators\nbelow, mounted on bench, or stool, or trestle, or huddled against the\nrope-ring, were jostling, and stamping, and craning their necks, and\ndigging elbows into one another, and yelling, and swearing, and waving\nrotten hats, as if the only element the Lord ever made was mob.\n\nSuddenly all jabber ceased, and only the howls of the storm were heard,\nand the patter from the sodden roof, as Polwarth of Bodmin, having taken\nformal back from Dascombe of Devon, (the winner of the Standards, a very\nfine player, but not big enough for him) skirred his flat hat into the\nmiddle of the sawdust, and stood there flapping his brawny arms, and\ntossing his big-rooted nose, like a bull. In the flare of the lights,\nhis grin looked malignant, and the swing of his bulk overweening; and\nthough he said nothing but \"Cornwall for ever!\" he said it as if it\nmeant--\"Devonshire be d--d!\"\n\nAfter looking at the company with mild contempt, he swaggered towards\nthe umpires, and took off his belt, with the silver buckles and the red\nstones flashing, and hung it upon the cross-rail for defiance. A shiver\nand a tremble of silence ran through the hearts, and on the lips of\nthree hundred sad spectators. Especially a gentleman who sate behind the\numpires, dressed in dark riding-suit and a flapped hat, was swinging\nfrom side to side with strong feeling.\n\n\"Is there no man to try a fall for Devonshire? Won't kill him to be\nbeaten. Consolation money, fifty shillings.\" The chairman of the\nCommittee announced; but nobody came forward.\n\nA deep groan was heard from old Channing the Clerk, who had known such\nvery different days; while the Cornishman made his three rounds of the\nring, before he should buckle on the belt again; and snorted each time,\nlike Goliath. Gathering up the creases of his calves, which hung like\nthe chins of an Alderman, he stuck his heels into the Devonshire earth,\nto ask what it was made of. Then, with a smile, which he felt to be\nkind, and heartily large to this part of the world, he stooped to pick\nup the hat gay with seven ribbons, wrung from Devonshire button-holes.\n\nBut behold, while his great hand was going to pick it up thus\ncarelessly, another hat struck it, and whirled it away, as a quoit\nstrikes a quoit that appears to have won.\n\n\"Devon for ever! And Cornwall to the Devil!\" A mighty voice shouted, and\na mighty man came in, shaking the rain and the wind from his hair. A\nroar of hurrahs overpowered the gale, as the man taking heed of nobody,\nstrode up to the belt, and with a pat of his left hand, said--\"I wants\nthis here little bit of ribbon.\"\n\n\"Thee must plai for 'un fust,\" cried the hero of Cornwall.\n\n\"What else be I come for?\" the other enquired.\n\nWhen formalities had been satisfied, and the proper clothing donned, and\nthe champions stood forth in the ring, looking at one another, the roof\nmight have dropped, without any man heeding, until it came across his\neyes.\n\nThe challenger's name had been announced--\"Harvey Tremlett, of\nDevonshire\"--but only one or two besides old Channing had any idea who\nhe was; and even old Channing was not aware that the man had been a\nwrestler from early youth, so seldom had he visited his native place.\n\n\"A' standeth like a man as understood it,\" \"A' be bigger in the back\nthan Carnishman,\" \"Hope 'a hath trained, or 's wind won't hold;\" sundry\nsuch comments of critical power showed that the public, as usual, knew\nten times as much as the performers.\n\nThese, according to the manner of the time, were clad alike, but wore no\npads, for the brutal practice of kicking was now forbidden at meetings\nof the better sort. A jacket, or jerkin, of tough sail-cloth,\nhalf-sleeved and open in front afforded firm grasp, but no clutch for\nthrottling; breeches of the stoutest cord, belted at waist and strapped\nat knee, red worsted stockings for Devonshire, and yellow on behalf of\nCornwall, completed their array; except that the Cornishman wore\nankle-boots, while the son of Devon, at his own request, was provided\nonly with sailor's pumps. The advantage of these, for lightness of step\nand pliancy of sole, was obvious; but very few players would venture\nupon them, at the risk of a crushed and disabled foot. \"Fear he bain't\nnim' enough for they pea-shells. They be all very well for a boy;\" said\nChanning.\n\nThe Cornishman saw that he had found his match, perhaps even his master\nin bodily strength, if the lasting power could be trusted. Skill and\nendurance must decide the issue, and here he knew his own pre-eminence.\nHe had three or four devices of his own invention, but of very doubtful\nfairness; if all other powers failed, he would have recourse to them.\n\nFor two or three circuits of the ring, their mighty frames and limbs\nkept time and poise with one another. Each with his left hand grasped\nthe other by the shoulder lappet; each kept his right hand hovering like\na hawk, and the fingers in ply for a dash, a grip, a tug. Face to face,\nand eye to eye, intent upon every twinkle, step for step they marched\nsideways, as if to the stroke of a heavy bell, or the beating of slow\nmusic. Each had his weight thrown slightly forwards, and his shoulders\nslouched a little, watching for one unwary move, and testing by some\nsubtle thrill the substance of the other, as a glass is filliped to try\nits ring.\n\nBy a feint of false step, and a trick of eye, Polwarth got an opening.\nIn he dashed, the other's arm flew up, and the Cornish grip went round\nhim. In vain he put forth his mighty strength, for there was no room to\nuse it. Down he crashed, but turned in falling, so that the back was\ndoubtful.\n\n\"Back\"! \"Fair back\"! \"No back at all.\" \"Four pins.\" \"Never, no, three\npins.\" \"See where his arm was?\" \"Foul, foul, foul!\" Shouts of wrath, and\neven blows ensued; for a score or two of Cornishmen were there.\n\n\"Hush for the Umpires!\" \"Hold your noise.\" \"Thee be a liar.\" \"So be\nyou.\" The wind and the rain were well out-roared, until the Umpires,\nafter some little consultation gave award.\n\n\"We allow it true back, for Cornwall. Unless the fall claims foul below\nbelt. If so, it will be for Referee.\" Which showed that they differed\nupon that point.\n\n\"Let 'un have it. I won't claim no foul. Let 'un do it again, if 'a\ncan.\" Thus spake the fallen man, striding up to the Umpires' post. A\nroar of cheers rang round the tent, though many a Devonshire face looked\nglum, and a few groans clashed with the frank hurrahs.\n\nThe second bout was a brief one, but afforded much satisfaction to all\nlovers of fair play, and therefore perhaps to the Cornishmen. What\nTremlett did was simply this. He feigned to be wholly absorbed in\nguarding against a repetition of the recent trick. The other expecting\nnothing more than tactics of defence was caught, quite unawares, by his\nown device, and down he went--a very candid four-pin fall.\n\nNow came the final bout, the supreme decision of the tie, the crowning\nstruggle for the palm. The issue was so doubtful, that the oldest and\nmost sage of all pal\u00c3\u00a6stric oracles could but look,--and feared that\nvoice might not prove--wise. Skill was equally divided, (setting dubious\ntricks aside), strength was a little in favour of Devon, but not too\nmuch turn of the balance, (for Cornwall had not produced a man of such\nmagnitude for many years) experience was on Cornwall's side; condition,\nand lasting power, seemed to be pretty fairly on a par. What was to\nsettle it? Devonshire knew.\n\nThat is to say, the fair County had its hopes,--though always too modest\nand frugal to back them--that something which it produces even more\nfreely than fair cheeks and kind eyes, and of which the corner land is\nnot so lavish--to wit fine temper, and tranquillity of nature, might\ncome to their mother's assistance. Even for fighting, no man is at the\nbest of himself, when exasperated. Far less can he be so in the gentler\nart.\n\nA proverb of large equity, and time-honoured wisdom, declares (with the\nbluntness of its race) that \"sauce for the goose is sauce for the\ngander.\" This maxim is pleasant enough to the goose; but the gander\nsputters wrathfully when it comes home to his breast. Polwarth felt it\nas a heinous outrage, that he had been the victim of his own device. As\nhe faced his rival for the last encounter, a scowl came down upon his\nnoble knobby forehead, his keen eyes glowered as with fire in his chest,\nand his wiry lips closed viciously. The Devonshire man, endowed with\nlarger and less turbid outlook, perceived that the other's wrath was\nkindled, and his own duty was to feed the flame.\n\nAccordingly, by quiet tricks, and flicks, such as no man would even feel\nunless already too peppery, he worked the moral system hard, and roused\nin the other's ample breast--or brain, if that be the combative part--a\nlofty disdain of discretion. Polwarth ground his teeth, and clenched his\nfist, spat fire--and all was up with him. One savage dash he made, which\nmight have swept a milestone backward, breast clashed on breast, he\nswung too high, the great yellow legs forsook the earth, and the great\nred ones flashed between them, then the mighty frame span in the air\nlike a flail, and fell flat as the blade of a turf-beater's spade.\n\n\"All over! All up! Needn't ask about that. Three times three for\nDevonshire! Again, again, again! Carnies, what can 'e say to that now?\"\n\nWild triumph, fierce dejection, yearning to fight it out prevailed;\nevery man's head was out of the government of his neck--when these two\nleading Counties were quenched alike. The great pole of red pine, fit\nmast for an Admiral, bearing all the structure overhead, snapped, like a\ncarrot, to a vast wild blast. In a weltering squash lay victor and\nvanquished, man with his fists up, and man eager to go at him, hearts\ntoo big to hold themselves for exultation, and hearts so low that wifely\ntouch was needed to encourage them, glorious head that had won fifty\nshillings, and poor numskull that had lost a pot of beer. Prostrate\nall, with mouths full of tallow, sawdust, pitch, and another fellow's\ntoes. Many were for a twelvemonth limpers; but nobody went to\nChurchyard.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\n\nA FIGHTING BOUT.\n\n\nAfter that mighty crash, every body with any sense left in its head went\nhome. There was more to talk about than Perlycross had come across in\nhalf a century. And the worst of it was, that every blessed man had his\nown troubles first to attend to; which is no fun at all, though his\nneighbour's are so pleasant. The Fair, in the covered market-place, had\nlong been a dreary concern, contending vainly against the stronger charm\nof the wrestling booth, and still more vainly against the furious\nweather. Even the biggest and best fed flares--and they were quite as\nbrisk in those days as they are now--gifted though they might be with\nrage and vigour, lost all self-control, and dashed in yellow forks, here\nthere and everywhere, singeing sometimes their own author's whiskers.\nLike a man who lives too fast, they killed themselves; and the poor\nCheap-Jacks, the Universal Oracles, the Benevolent Bounty-men, chucking\nguineas right and left, the Master of Cupid's bower, who supplied every\nlass with a lord, and every lad with a lady having a lapful of a hundred\nthousand pounds--sadly they all strapped up, and lit their pipes, and\nshivered at that terrible tramp before them, cursing the weather, and\ntheir wives, and even the hallowed village of Perlycross.\n\nThough the coaches had forsaken this ancient track from Exeter to\nLondon, and followed the broader turnpike roads, there still used to be\nevery now and then a string of packhorses, or an old stage-waggon, not\nafraid of hills and making no fuss about time, but straggling at leisure\nthrough the pristine thoroughfares, thwarted less with toll-bars.\n\nNotably, old Hill's _God-be-with-us_ van left Exeter on Tuesdays, with\nthe goodwill of three horses, some few hours in the afternoon, and might\nbe trusted to appear at Perlycross according to the weather and\ncondition of the roads. What more comfortable course of travel could\nthere be for any one who understood it, and enjoyed sound sleep, and a\ngood glass of ale at intervals, with room enough to dine inside if he\nthought fit, than the _God-be-with-us_ van afforded? For old Hill was\nalways in charge of it himself, and expected no more than a penny a\nmile, and perhaps the power to drink the good health of any peaceful\nsubject of the King, who might be inclined to come along with him, and\nlisten to his moving tales. The horses were fat, and they rested at\nnight, and took it easily in the daytime; and the leader had three\nlittle bells on his neck, looking, when you sat behind him, like a pair\nof scales; and without them he always declined to take a step, and the\nwheelers backed him up in that denial. For a man not bound to any\ndomineering hour, or even to a self-important day, the broad-wheeled\nwaggon belonging to old Hill--\"Old-as-the-Hills\" some flippant younkers\ncalled him--was as good an engine as need be, for crossing of the\ncountry, when it wanted to be crossed, and halting at any town of\nhospitable turn.\n\nThat same Shrove-Tuesday,--and it is well to mark the day, because\nMaster Hill was so superior to dates--this man who asserted the dignity\nof our race, by not allowing matter to disturb him, was coming down hill\nwith his heavy drag on, in a road that was soft from the goodness of the\nsoil; when a man with two legs made of better stuff than ours, either\ncame out of a gate across the van, or else fairly walked it down by\nsuperior speed behind. \"Ship ahoy!\" he shouted; and old Hill was wide\nawake, for he had two or three barrels that would keep rolling into the\nsmall of his back--as he called it, with his usual oblivion of\nchronology--and so he was enabled to discern this man, and begin at his\nleisure to consider him.\n\nIf the man had shouted again, or shown any other symptom of small hurry,\nthe driver--or properly speaking the drifter, for the horses did their\nown driving--would have felt some disappointment in him, as an inferior\nfellow-creature. But the man on foot, or at least on stumps, was in no\nmore hurry than old Hill himself, and steadfastly trudged to the bottom\nof the hill, looking only at the horses--a very fine sign.\n\nThe land being Devon, it is needless to say that there was no\ninconsistency about it. Wherever one hill ends, there another begins,\nwith just room enough between them for a horse to spread his legs, and\nshake himself with self-approbation. And he is pretty sure to find a\ncrystal brook, purling across the road, and twinkling bright temptation\nto him.\n\n\"Hook up skid, and then 'e can jump in;\" said old Hill in the hollow\nwhere the horses backed, and he knew by the clank that it had been done,\nand then by a rattle on the floor behind him, that the stranger had\nembarked by the chains at the rear. After about a mile or so of soft low\nwhistling, in which he excelled all Carriers, old Hill turned round with\na pleasant grin, for there was a great deal of good about him.\n\n\"Going far?\" He asked, as an opening of politeness, rather than of\ncuriosity.\n\n\"Zort of a place, called Perlycrass;\" replied the wooden-leg'd man, who\nwas sitting on a barrel. Manifestly an ancient sailor, weather-beaten,\nand taciturn, the residue of a strong and handsome man.\n\nThe whole of this had been as nearly to the Carrier's liking, as the\nwords and deeds of any man can be to any other's. Therefore before\nanother mile had been travelled, old Hill turned round again, with a\ngrin still sweeter.\n\n\"Pancake day, bain't it?\" was his very kind enquiry.\n\n\"B'lieve it be;\" replied the other, in the best and truest British\nstyle. After this no more was lacking to secure old Hill's regard than\nthe very thing the sailor did. There was a little flap of canvas, like a\nloophole in the tilt, fitted for the use of chawers, and the cleanliness\nof the floor. Timberlegs after using this, with much deliberation and\ngreat skill, made his way forward, and in deep silence poked old Hill\nwith his open tobacco-box. If it were not silver, it was quite as good\nto look at, and as bright as if it held the freedom of the City; the\ntobacco, moreover, was of goodly reek, and a promise of inspiration such\nas never flows through Custom-house.\n\n\"Thank 'e, I'll have a blade bumbai. Will 'e zit upon that rope of\nonions?\" The sailor shook his head; for the rim of a barrel, though apt\nto cut, cuts evenly like a good schoolmaster.\n\n\"'Long of Nelson?\" Master Hill enquired, pointing to the places where\nthe feet were now of deputy. The old Tar nodded; and then with that\nsensitive love of accuracy which marks the Tar, growled out, \"Leastways,\nwan of them.\"\n\n\"And what come to t'other wan?\" Master Hill was capable of really large\nhuman interest.\n\n\"Had 'un off, to square the spars, and for zake of vamily.\" He had no\ndesire to pursue the subject, and closed it by a big squirt through the\nflap.\n\nOld Hill nodded with manly approbation. Plymouth was his birthplace; and\nhe knew that other sons of Nelson had done this; for it balanced their\nbodies, and composed their minds with another five shillings a week for\nlife, and the sale of the leg covered all expenses.\n\n\"You'm a very ingenious man;\" he glanced as he spoke, at the sailor's\njury-rig; \"I'll war'n no doctor could a' vitted 'e up, like thiccy.\"\n\n\"Vitted 'un myself with double swivel. Can make four knots an hour now.\nThey doctors can undo 'e; but 'em can't do 'e up. A cove can't make sail\nupon a truck-head.\"\n\n\"And what do 'e say to the weather, Cap'n?\" Master Hill enquired of his\npassenger, when a few more compliments had passed, and the manes of the\nhorses began to ruffle, and the tilt to sway and rattle with the waxing\nstorm.\n\n\"Think us shall have as big a gale of wind as ever come out of the\nheavens,\" the sailor replied, after stumping to the tail of the van, and\ngazing windwards; \"heave to pretty smart, and make all snug afore\nsunset, is my advice. Too much sail on this here little craft, for such\na blow as us shall have to-night.\"\n\n\"Can't stop short of Taunton town.\" Old Hill was famed for his\nobstinacy.\n\n\"Can 'e take in sail? Can 'e dowse this here canvas? Can 'e reef it then\nsomehow?\" The old man shook his head. \"Tell 'e what then, shipmate--if\n'e carry on for six hours more, this here craft will be on her\nbeam-ends, wi'out mainsail parteth from his lashings, sure as my name is\nDick Herniman.\"\n\nThis Tar of the old school, better known as \"timber-leg'd Dick,\"\ndisembarked from the craft, whose wreck he had thus predicted, at a\nturning betwixt Perliton and Perlycross, and stumped away up a narrow\nlane, at a pace quite equal to that of the _God-be-with-us_ van. The\nhorses looked after him, as a specimen of biped hitherto beyond their\nexperience; and old Hill himself, though incapable of amazement (which\nis a rapid process) confessed that there were some advantages in this\nform of human pedal, as well as fine economy of cloth and leather.\n\n\"How 'a doth get along, nimbler nor I could!\" the Carrier reflected, as\nhis nags drove on again. \"Up to zummat ratchety, I'll be bound he be\nnow. A leary old salt as ever lived. Never laughed once, never showed a\nsmile, but gotten it all in his eyes he have: and the eyes be truer\nfolks than the lips. Enough a'most to tempt a man to cut off 's own two\nlegses.\"\n\nSome hours later than this, and one hour later than the downfall of the\nwrestler's roof, the long market-place, forming one side of the\nstreet--a low narrow building set against the churchyard wall, between\nthe school and the lych-gate, looked as dismal, and dreary, and\ndeserted, as the bitterest enemy of Fairs could wish. The torrents of\nrain, and fury of the wind, had driven all pleasure-seekers, in a\ngrievously drenched and battered plight, to seek for wiser comfort; and\nonly a dozen or so of poor creatures, either too tipsy to battle with\nthe wind, or too reckless in their rags to care where they were,\nwallowed upon sacks, and scrabbled under the stanchion-boards, where the\ngaiety had been. The main gates, buckled back upon their heavy hinges,\nwere allowed to do nothing in their proper line of business, until the\nChurch-clock should strike twelve, for such was the usage; though as\nusual nobody had ever heard who ordained it. A few oil-lamps were still\nin their duty, swinging like welted horn-poppies in the draught, and\nshedding a pale and spluttering light.\n\nThe man who bore the keys had gone home three times, keeping under hele\nwith his oil-skins on, to ask his wife--who was a woman of some\nmark--whether he might not lock the gates, and come home and have his\nbit of bacon. But she having strong sense of duty, and a good log\nblazing, and her cup of tea, had allowed him very generously to warm\nhis hands a little, and then begged him to think of his family. This was\nthe main thing that he had to do; and he went forth again into the dark,\nto do it.\n\nMeanwhile, without anybody to take heed (for the Sergeant, ever\nvigilant, was now on guard in Spain), a small but choice company of\nhuman beings, was preparing for action in the old school-porch, which\nstood at the back of the building. Staffs they had, and handcuffs too,\nand supple straps, and loops of cord; all being men of some learning in\nthe law, and the crooked ways of people out of harmony therewith. If\nthere had been light enough to understand a smile, they would have\nsmiled at one another, so positive were they that they had an easy job,\nand so grudgeful that the money should cut up so small. The two worthy\nconstables of Perlycross felt certain that they could do it better by\nthemselves; and the four invoked from Perliton were vexed, to have to\nact with village lubbers. Their orders were not to go nigh the\nwrestling, or show themselves inside the market-place, but to keep\nthemselves quiet, and shun the weather, and what was a great deal worse,\nthe beer. Every now and then, the ideas of jolly noises, such as were\nappropriate to the time, were borne upon the rollicking wings of the\nwind into their silent vestibule, suggesting some wiping of lips, which,\nalas, were ever so much too dry already. At a certain signal, they were\nall to hasten across the corner of the churchyard, at the back of the\nmarket-place, and enter a private door at the east end of the building,\nafter passing through the lych-gate.\n\nSuddenly the rain ceased, as if at sound of trumpet; like the mouth of a\ncavern the sky flew open, and the wind, leaping three points of the\ncompass, rushed upon the world from the chambers of the west. Such a\nblast, as had never been felt before, filled the whole valley of the\nPerle, and flung mowstack, and oakwood, farmhouse, and abbey, under the\nsweep of its wings as it flew. The roar of the air overpowered the crash\nof the ruin it made, and left no man the sound of his own voice to\nhimself.\n\nThese great swoops of wind always lighten the sky; and as soon as the\npeople blown down could get up, they were able to see the church-tower\nstill upright, though many men swore that they heard it go rock. Very\nlikely it rocked, but could they have heard it?\n\nIn the thick of the din of this awful night, when the church-clock\nstruck only five instead of ten--and it might have struck fifty, without\nbeing heard--three men managed, one by one, and without any view of one\nanother, to creep along the creases of the storm, and gain the gloomy\nshelter of the market-place. \"Every man for himself,\" is the universal\nlaw, when the heavens are against the whole race of us. Not one of these\nmen cared to ask about the condition of the other two, nor even expected\nmuch to see them, though each was more resolute to be there himself,\nbecause of its being so difficult.\n\n\"Very little chance of Timberlegs to-night,\" said one to another, as two\nof them stood in deep shadow against the back wall, where a voice could\nbe heard if pitched in the right direction; \"he could never make way\nagain' a starm like this.\"\n\n\"Thou bee'st a liar,\" replied a gruff voice, as the clank of metal on\nthe stone was heard. \"Timberlegs can goo, where flesh and bone be\nmollichops.\" He carried a staff like a long handspike, and prodded the\nbiped on his needless feet, to make him wish to be relieved of them.\n\n\"Us be all here now,\" said the third man, who seemed in the wavering\ngloom to fill half the place. \"What hast thou brought us for,\nTimber-leg'd Dick?\"\n\n\"Bit of a job, same as three months back. Better than clam-pits, worn't\nit now? Got a good offer for thee too, Harvey, for that old ramshackle\nplace. Handy hole for a louderin' job, and not far from them clam-pits.\"\n\n\"Ay, so a' be. Never thought of that. And must have another coney, now\nthey wise 'uns have vound out Nigger's Nock. Lor' what a laugh we had,\nJem and I, at they fules of Perlycrass!\"\n\n\"Then Perlycross will have the laugh at thee. Harvey Tremlett, and James\nKettel, I arrest 'e both, in the name of His Majesty the King.\"\n\nSix able-bodied men (who had entered, unheard in the roar of the gale,\nand unseen in the gloom), stood with drawn staffs, heels together, and\nshoulder to shoulder, in a semi-circle, enclosing the three\nconspirators.\n\n\"Read thy warrant aloud,\" said Dick Herniman, striking his handspike\nupon the stones, and taking command in right of intellect; while the\nother twain laid their backs against the wall, and held themselves ready\nfor the issue.\n\nDick had hit a very hard nail on the head. None of these constables had\nbeen young enough to undergo Sergeant Jakes, and thenceforth defy the\nmost lofty examiner.\n\n\"Didn't hear what 'e zed,\" replied head-constable, making excuse of the\nwind, which had blown him but little of the elements. But he lowered his\nstaff, and held consultation.\n\n\"Then I zay it again,\" shouted Timber-leg'd Dick, stumping forth with a\npower of learning, for he had picked up good leisure in hospitals; \"if\nthou representest the King, read His Majesty's words, afore taking his\nname in vain.\"\n\nThese six men were ready, and resolute enough, to meet any bodily\nconflict; but the literary crisis scared them.\n\n\"Can e' do it, Jack?\" \"Don't know as I can.\" \"Wish my boy Bill was\nhere.\" \"Don't run in my line\"--and so on.\n\n\"If none on 'e knows what he be about,\" said the man with the best legs\nto stand upon, advancing into the midst of them, \"I know a deal of the\nlaw; and I tell 'e, as a friend of the King, who hath lost two legs for\n'un, in the Royal Navy, there can't be no lawful arrest made here. And\nthe liberty of the subject cometh in, the same as a' doth again'\nhighwaymen. Harvey Tremlett, and Jem Kettel, the law be on your side, to\n'protect the liberty of the subject.'\"\n\nThis was enough for the pair who had stood, as law-abiding Englishmen,\nagainst the wall, with their big fists doubled, and their great hearts\ndoubting. \"Here goo'th for the liberty of the subject,\" cried Harvey\nTremlett, striding forth; \"I shan't strike none as don't strike me. But\nif a doth, a' must look out.\"\n\nThe constables wavered, in fear of the law, and doubt of their own duty;\nfor they had often heard that every man had a right to know what he was\narrested for. Unluckily one of them made a blow with his staff at Harvey\nTremlett; then he dropped on the flags with a clump in his ear, and the\nfight in a moment was raging.\n\nSomebody knocked Jemmy Kettel on the head, as being more easy to deal\nwith; and then the blood of the big man rose. Three stout fellows fell\nupon him all together, and heavy blows rung on the drum of his chest,\nfrom truncheons plied like wheel-spokes. Forth flew his fist-clubs right\nand left, one of them meeting a staff in the air, and shattering it back\ninto its owner's face. Never was the peace of the King more broken; no\nman could see what became of his blows, legs and arms went about like\nwindmills, substance and shadow were all as one, till the substance\nrolled upon the ground, and groaned.\n\nThis dark flight resembled the clashing of a hedgerow in the fury of a\nmidnight storm; when the wind has got in and cannot get out, when\nground-ash, and sycamore, pole, stub, and saplin, are dashing and\nwhirling against one another, and even the sturdy oak-tree in the trough\nis swaying, and creaking, and swinging on its hole.\n\n\"Zoonder not to kill e'er a wan of 'e, I 'ood. But by the Lord, if 'e\ncomes they byses\"--shouted Harvey Tremlett, as a rope was thrown over\nhis head from behind, but cut in half a second by Herniman--\"more of 'e,\nbe there?\" as the figures thickened--\"have at 'e then, wi' zummat more\nharder nor visties be!\"\n\nHe wrenched from a constable his staff, and strode onward, being already\nnear the main gate now. As he whirled the heavy truncheon round his\nhead, the constables hung back, having two already wounded, and one in\nthe grip of reviving Jem, who was rolling on the floor with him.\n\"Zurrender to His Majesty;\" they called out, preferring the voluntary\nsystem.\n\n\"A varden for the lot of 'e!\" the big man said, and he marched in a\nmanner that presented it.\n\nBut not so did he walk off, blameless and respectable. He had kept his\ntemper wonderfully, believing the law to be on his side, after all he\nhad done for the County.\n\nNow his nature was pressed a little too hard for itself, when just as he\nhad called out--\"coom along, Jem; there be nort to stop 'e, Timberlegs;\"\nretiring his forces with honour--two figures, hitherto out of the moil,\nstood across him at the mouth of exit.\n\n\"Who be you?\" he asked, with his anger in a flame; for they showed\nneither staff of the King, nor warrant. \"Volunteers, be 'e? Have a care\nwhat be about.\"\n\n\"Harvey Tremlett, here you stop.\" Said a tall man, square in front of\nhim. But luckily for his life, the lift of the sky showed that his hair\nwas silvery.\n\n\"Never hits an old man. You lie there;\" Tremlett took him with his left\nhand, and laid him on the stones. But meanwhile the other flung his arms\naround his waist.\n\n\"Wult have a zettler? Then thee shall,\" cried the big man, tearing him\nout like a child, and swinging his truncheon, for to knock him on the\nhead, and Jemmy Fox felt that his time was come.\n\nDown came the truncheon, like a paviour's rammer, and brains would have\nweltered on the floor like suds, but a stout arm dashed across, and\nreceived the crash descending.\n\n\"Pumpkins!\" cried the smiter, wondering much what he had smitten, as two\nbodies rolled between his legs and on the stones. \"Coom along, Jemmy\nboy. Nare a wan to stop 'e.\"\n\nThe remnant of the constables upon their legs fell back. The Lord was\nagainst them. They had done their best. The next job for them was to\nheal their wounds, and get an allowance for them, if they could.\n\nNow the human noise was over, but the wind roared on, and the rushing of\nthe clouds let the stars look down again. Tremlett stood victorious in\nthe middle of the gateway. Hurry was a state of mind beyond his\nunderstanding. Was everybody satisfied? Well, no one came for more. He\ntook an observation of the weather, and turned round.\n\n\"Shan't bide here no longer,\" he announced. \"Dick, us'll vinish up our\nclack to my place. Rain be droud up, and I be off.\"\n\n\"No, Harvey Tremlett, you will not be off. You will stay here like a\nman, and stand your trial.\"\n\nMr. Penniloe's hand was upon his shoulder, and the light of the stars,\nthrown in vaporous waves, showed the pale face firmly regarding him.\n\n\"Well, and if I says no to it, what can 'e do?\"\n\n\"Hold you by the collar, as my duty is.\" The Parson set his teeth, and\nhis delicate white fingers tightened their not very formidable grasp.\n\n\"Sesh!\" said the big man, with a whistle, and making as if he could not\nmove. \"When a man be baten, a' must gie in. Wun't 'e let me goo, Passon?\nDo 'e let me goo.\"\n\n\"Tremlett, my duty is to hold you fast. I owe it to a dear friend of\nmine, as well as to my parish.\"\n\n\"Well, you be a braver man than most of 'em, I zimmeth. But do 'e tell a\npoor chap, as have no chance at all wi' 'e, what a' hath dooed, to be\nlawed for 'un so crule now.\"\n\n\"Prisoner, as if you did not know. You are charged with breaking open\nColonel Waldron's grave, and carrying off his body.\"\n\n\"Oh Lord! Oh Lord in Heaven!\" shouted Harvey Tremlett. \"Jem Kettel, hark\nto thiccy! Timberlegs, do 'e hear thic? All they blessed constables, as\nhas got their bellyful, and ever so many wise gen'lemen too, what do 'e\nthink 'em be arter us for? Arter us for resurrectioneering! Never heered\ntell such a joke in all my life. They hosebirds to _Ivy-bush_ cries\n'Carnwall for ever!' But I'm blest if I don't cry out 'Perlycrass for\never!' Oh Lord, oh Lord! Was there ever such a joke? Don't 'e hold me,\nsir, for half a minute, just while I has out my laugh--fear I should\nthrow 'e down with shaking so.\"\n\nTimber-leg'd Dick came up to his side, and not being of the laughing\nkind, made up for it by a little hornpipe in the lee; his mental feet\nstriking, from the flints pitched there, sparks enough to light a dozen\npipes; while Kettel, though damaged severely about the mouth, was still\nable to compass a broad and loud guffaw.\n\n\"Prisoners,\" Mr. Penniloe said severely, for he misliked the ridicule of\nhis parish; \"this is not at all a matter to be laughed at. The evidence\nagainst you is very strong, I fear.\"\n\n\"Zurrender, zurrender, to His Majesty the King!\" cried Tremlett, being\nnever much at argument. \"Constables, if 'ee can goo, take charge. But I\n'ont have no handicuffs, mind. Wudn't a gie'd 'ee a clout, if I had\nknawed it. Zarve 'ee right though, for not rading of thic\nwarrant-papper. Jemmy boy, you zurrender to the King; and I be Passon's\nprisoner. Honour bright fust though--nort to come agin' us, unless a' be\nzet down in warrant-papper. Passon, thee must gi'e thy word for that.\nTimberlegs, coom along for layyer.\"\n\n\"Certainly, I give my word, as far as it will go, that no other charge\nshall be brought against you. The warrant is issued for that crime only.\nProve yourselves guiltless of that, and you are free.\"\n\n\"Us won't be very long in prison then. A day or two bain't much odds to\nwe.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\n\nGENTLE AS A LAMB.\n\n\nOf the nine people wounded in that Agor\u00c3\u00a4ic struggle, which cast expiring\nlustre on the Fairs of Perlycross, every one found his case most serious\nto himself, and still more so to his wife; and even solemn, in the\npresence of those who had to settle compensation. Herniman had done some\nexecution, as well as received a nasty splinter of one leg, which broke\ndown after his hornpipe; and Kettel had mauled the man who rolled over\nwith him. But, as appeared when the case was heard, Tremlett had by no\nmeans done his best; and his lawyer put it touchingly and with great\neffect, that he was loth to smite the sons of his native county, when he\nhad just redeemed their glory, by noble discomfiture of Cornwall.\n\nOne man only had a parlous wound; and as is generally ordained in human\nmatters, this was the one most impartial of all, the one who had no\ninterest of his own to serve, the one who was present simply out of pure\nbenevolence, and a Briton's love of order. So at least his mother said;\nand every one acknowledged that she was a woman of high reasoning\npowers. Many others felt for him, as who would have done the same, with\nlike opportunity.\n\nFor only let a healthy, strong, and earnest-minded Englishman--to use a\nbeloved compound epithet of the day--hear of a hot and lawful fight\nimpending, with people involved in it, of whom he has some knowledge,\nand we may trust him heartily to be there or thereabouts, to see--as he\nputs it to his conscience--fair play. But an if he chance to be in love\njust then, with a very large percentage of despair to reckon up, and one\nof the combatants is in the count against him, can a doubt remain of his\neager punctuality?\n\nThis was poor Frank Gilham's case. Dr. Gronow was a prudent man, and\nliked to have the legions on his side. He perceived that young Frank was\na staunch and stalwart fellow, sure to strike a good blow on a friend's\nbehalf. He was well aware also of his love for Christie, and could not\nsee why it should come to nothing. While Jemmy Fox's faith in the\nresources of the law, and in his own prowess as a power in reserve, were\nnot so convincing to the elder mind. \"Better make sure, than be too\ncertain,\" was a favourite maxim of this shrewd old stager; and so\nwithout Jemmy's knowledge he invited Frank, to keep out of sight unless\nwanted.\n\nThis measure saved the life of Dr. Fox, and that of Harvey Tremlett too,\nsome of whose brothers had adorned the gallows. Even as it was, Jemmy\nFox lay stunned, with the other man's arm much inserted in his hat.\nWhere he would have been without that arm for buffer, the Cherub, who\nsits on the chimney-pots of Harley Street, alone can say. Happily the\nother doctor was unhurt, and left in full possession of his wits, which\nhe at once exerted. After examining the wounded yeoman, who had fainted\nfrom the pain and shock, he borrowed a mattress from the rectory, a\nspring-cart and truss of hay from Channing the baker, and various other\nappliances; and thus in spite of the storm conveyed both patients to\nhospital. This was the _Old Barn_ itself, because all surgical needs\nwould be forthcoming there more readily, and so it was wiser to decline\nMr. Penniloe's offer of the rectory.\n\nWith the jolting of the cart, and the freshness of the air, Fox began to\nrevive ere long; and though still very weak and dizzy, was able to be of\nsome service at his own dwelling-place; and although he might not, when\nthis matter first arose, have shown all the gratitude which the sanguine\ndo expect, in return for Frank Gilham's loyalty, he felt very deep\ncontrition now, when he saw this frightful fracture, and found his own\nhead quite uncracked.\n\nThe six constables, though they had some black eyes, bruised limbs, and\nbroken noses, and other sources of regret, were (in strict matter of\nfact, and without any view to compensation) quite as well as could be\nexpected. And as happens too often, the one who groaned the most had the\nleast occasion for it. It was only the wick of a lamp, that had dropped,\nwithout going out, on this man's collar, and burned a little hole in his\n_niddick_, as it used to be called in Devonshire.\n\nTremlett readily gave his word that no escape should be attempted; and\nwhen Mrs. Muggridge came to know that this was the man who had saved her\nmaster, nothing could be too good for him. So constables and prisoners\nwere fed and cared for, and stowed for the night in the long schoolroom,\nwith hailstones hopping in the fireplace.\n\nIn the morning, the weather was worse again; for this was a\ndouble-barrel'd gale, as an ignorant man might term it; or rather\nperhaps two several gales, arising from some vast disturbance, and\nhitting into one another. Otherwise, why should it be known and\nremembered even to the present day, as the great Ash-Wednesday gale,\nalthough it began on Shrove-Tuesday, and in many parts raged most\nfiercely then? At Perlycross certainly there was no such blast upon the\nsecond day, as that which swept the Abbey down: when the wind leaped\nsuddenly to the west, and the sky fell open, as above recorded.\n\nUpon that wild Ash-Wednesday forenoon, the curate stood in the\nchurchyard mourning, even more than the melancholy date requires. Where\nthe old Abbey had stood for ages (backing up the venerable church with\ngrand dark-robed solemnity, and lifting the buckler of ancient faith\nabove many a sleeping patriarch) there was nothing but a hideous gap,\nwith murky clouds galloping over it. Shorn of its ivy curtain by the\ntempest of last Sunday, the mighty frame had reeled, and staggered, and\nwith one crash gone to ground last night, before the impetuous welkin's\nweight.\n\n\"Is all I do to be always vain, and worse than vain--destructive,\nhurtful, baneful, fatal I might say, to the very objects for which I\nstrive? Here is the church, unfinished, leaky, with one of its corners\ngone underground, and the grand stone screen smashed in two; here is the\nAbbey, or alas not here, but only an ugly pile of stones! Here is the\noutrage to my dear friend, and the shame to the parish as black as ever;\nfor those men clearly know nothing of it. And here, or at any rate close\nat hand, the sad drawback upon all good works; for at Lady-day in pour\nthe bills, and my prayers (however earnest) will not pay them. It has\npleased the Lord, in His infinite wisdom, to leave me very short of\ncash.\"\n\nUnhappily his best hat had been spoiled, in that interview with the four\nvergers; and in his humility he was not sure that the one on his head\nwas good enough even to go to the Commination service. However it need\nnot have felt unworthy; for there was not a soul in the church to be\nadjured, save that which had been under its own brim. The clerk was off\nfor Perliton, swearing--even at his time of life!--that he had been\nsubpoenaed, as if that could be on such occasion; and as for the pupils,\nall bound to be in church, the Hopper had been ordered by the Constables\nto present himself to the Magistrates (though all the Constables denied\nit) and Pike, and Mopuss, felt it their duty to go with him.\n\nIn a word, all Perlycross was off, though services of the Church had not\nyet attained their present continuity; and though every woman, and even\nman, had to plod three splashy miles, with head on chest, in the teeth\nof the gale up the river. How they should get into the room, when there,\nwas a question that never occurred to them. There they all yearned to\nbe; and the main part, who could not raise a shilling, or prove\nthemselves Uncles, or Aunts, or former sweethearts of the two Constables\nwho kept the door, had to crouch under dripping shrubs outside the\nwindows, and spoiled all Squire Mockham's young crocuses.\n\nThat gentleman was so upright, and thoroughly impartial, that to\ncounteract his own predilections for a champion wrestler, he had begged\na brother-magistrate to come and sit with him on this occasion; not Sir\nEdwin Sanford, who was of the Quorum for Somerset, but a man of some\nlearning and high esteem, the well-known Dr. Morshead. Thus there would\nbe less temptation for any tattler to cry, \"hole and corner,\" as\nspiteful folk rejoice to do, while keeping in that same place\nthemselves. Although there was less perhaps of mischief-making in those\ndays than now; and there could be no more.\n\nThe Constables marched in, with puff and blow, like victors over rebels,\nand as if they had carried the prisoners captive, every yard of the way,\nfrom Perlycross. All of them began to talk at once, and to describe with\nmore vigour than truth the conflict of the night before. But Dr.\nMorshead stopped them short, for the question of resistance was not yet\nraised. What the Bench had first to decide was whether a case could be\nmade out for a _mittimus_, in pursuance of the warrant, to the next\nPetty Sessions on Monday; whence the prisoners would be remitted\nprobably to the Quarter Sessions.\n\nThe two accused stood side by side (peaceful and decorous, as if they\nwere accustomed to it); and without any trepidation admitted their\nidentity. It was rather against their interests that the Official Clerk\nwas absent--this not being a stated meeting, but held for special\npurpose--for Magistrates used to be a little nervous, without their\nproper adviser; and in fear of permitting the guilty to escape, they\nsometimes remanded upon insufficient grounds.\n\nIn the present case, there was nothing whatever to connect these two men\nwith the crime, except the testimony of Joe Crang, and what might be\nregarded as their own admission, overheard by Dr. Fox. The latter was\nnot in court, nor likely so to be; and as for the blacksmith's evidence,\nhowever positive it might seem, what did it amount to? And such as it\nwas, it was torn to rags, through the quaking of the deponent.\n\nFor a sharp little lawyer started up, as lawyers are sure to do\neverywhere, and crossed the room to where Herniman sat, drumming the\nfloor with metallic power, and looking very stolid. But a glance had\nconvinced the keen Attorney, that here were the brains of the party, and\na few short whispers settled it. \"Guinea, if 'e gets 'em off; if not,\nne'er a farden.\" \"Right!\" said the lawyer, and announced himself.\n\n\"Blickson, for the defence, your Worships--Maurice Blickson of\nSilverton.\" The proper bows were interchanged; and then came Crang's\nexcruciation. Already this sturdy and very honest fellow, was as he\nelegantly described it, in a \"lantern-sweat\" of terror. It is one thing\nto tell a tale to two friends in a potato-field, and another to narrate\nthe same on oath, with four or five quills in mysterious march, two most\nworshipful signors bending brows of doubt upon you, and thirty or forty\nfaces scowling at every word--\"What a liar you be!\" And when on the top\nof all this, stands up a noble gentleman, with keen eyes, peremptory\nvoice, contemptuous smiles, and angry gestures, all expressing his\nChristian sorrow, that the Devil should have so got hold of you,--what\nblacksmith, even of poetic anvil (whence all rhythm and metre spring)\ncan have any breath left in his own bellows?\n\nJoe Crang had fallen on his knees, to take the oath; as witnesses did,\nfrom a holy belief that this turned the rungs of the gallows the wrong\nway; and then he had told his little tale most sadly, as one who hopes\nnever to be told of it again. His business had thriven, while his health\nwas undermined; through the scores of good people, who could rout up so\nmuch as a knife that wanted a rivet, or even a boy with one tooth\npushing up another; and though none of them paid more than fourpence for\nthings that would last them a fortnight to talk about, their money\nstayed under the thatch, while Joe spent nothing but a wink for all his\nbeer.\n\nBut ah, this was no winking time! Crang was beginning to shuffle off,\nwith his knuckles to his forehead; and recovering his mind so loudly\nthat he got in a word about the quality of his iron--which for the rest\nof his life he would have cited, to show how he beat they\nJustesses--when he found himself recalled, and told to put his feet\ntogether. This, from long practice of his art, had become a difficulty\nto him, and in labouring to do it he lost all possibility of bringing\nhis wits into the like position. This order showed Blickson to be almost\na Verulam in his knowledge of mankind. Joe Crang recovered no\nself-possession, on his own side of better than a gallon strong.\n\n\"Blacksmith, what o'clock is it now?\"\n\nCrang put his ears up, as if he expected the Church-clock to come to his\naid; and then with a rally of what he was hoping for, as soon as he got\nround the corner, replied--\"Four and a half, your honour.\"\n\n\"I need not remind your Worships,\" said Blickson, when the laughter had\nsubsided; \"that this fellow's evidence, even if correct, proves nothing\nwhatever against my Clients. But just to show what it is worth, I will,\nwith your Worships' permission, put a simple question to him. He has\nsworn that it was two o'clock on a foggy morning, and with no\nChurch-clock to help him, when he saw, in his night-mare this ghostly\nvision. Perhaps he should have said--'four and a half;' which in broad\ndaylight is his idea of the present hour. Now, my poor fellow, did you\nswear, or did you not, on a previous occasion, that one of the men who\nso terrified you out of your heavy sleep, was Dr. James Fox--a\ngentleman, Dr. Morshead, of your own distinguished Profession? Don't\nshuffle with your feet, Crang, nor yet with your tongue. Did you swear\nthat, or did you not?\"\n\n\"Well, if I did, twadn't arkerate.\"\n\n\"In plain English, you perjured yourself on that occasion. And yet you\nexpect their Worships to believe you now! Now look at the other man, the\ntall one. By which of his features do you recognize him now, at four and\na half, in the morning?\"\n\n\"Dun'now what veitchers be. Knows 'un by his size, and manner of\nstandin'. Should like to hear's voice, if no object to you, layyer.\"\n\n\"My friend, you call me by your own name. Such is your confusion of\nideas. Will your Worships allow me to assist this poor numskull? The\ngreat Cornish wrestler is here, led by that noble fraternal feeling,\nwhich is such a credit to all men distinguished, in any walk of life.\nMr. Polwarth of Bodmin, will you kindly stand by the side of your\nbrother in a very noble art?\"\n\nIt was worth a long journey in bad weather (as Squire Mockham told his\nguests at his dinner-party afterwards, and Dr. Morshead and his son\nconfirmed it) to see the two biggest growths of Devonshire and of\nCornwall standing thus amicably side by side, smiling a little slyly at\neach other, and blinking at their Worships with some abashment, as if to\nsay--\"this is not quite in our line.\"\n\nFor a moment the audience forgot itself, and made itself audible with\nthree loud cheers. \"Silence!\" cried their Worships, but not so very\nsternly.\n\n\"Reckon, I could drow 'e next time;\" said Cornwall.\n\n\"Wun't zay but what 'e maight;\" answered Devon courteously.\n\n\"Now little blacksmith,\" resumed the lawyer, though Joe Crang was\nconsiderably bigger than himself; \"will you undertake to swear, upon\nyour hope of salvation, which of those two gentlemen you saw, that\nnight?\"\n\nJoe Crang stared at the two big men, and his mind gave way within him.\nHe was dressed in his best, and his wife had polished up his cheeks and\nnose with yellow soap, which gleamed across his vision with a kind of\nglaze, and therein danced pen, ink, and paper, the figures of the big\nmen, the faces of their Worships, and his own hopes of salvation.\n\n\"Maight 'a been Carnisher;\" he began to stammer, with a desire to\ngratify his county; but a hiss went round the room from Devonian sense\nof Justice; and to strike a better balance, he finished in\ndespair--\"Wull then, it waz both on 'em.\"\n\n\"Stand down, sir!\" Dr. Morshead shouted sternly, while Blickson went\nthrough a little panorama of righteous astonishment and disgust. All the\naudience roared, and a solid farmer called out--\"Don't come near me, you\ninfernal liar,\" as poor Crang sought shelter behind his topcoat. So much\nfor honesty, simplicity, and candour, when the nervous system has broken\ndown!\n\n\"After that, I should simply insult the intelligence of your Worships;\"\ncontinued the triumphant lawyer, \"by proceeding to address you. Perhaps\nI should ask you to commit that wretch for perjury; but I leave him to\nhis conscience, if he has one.\"\n\n\"The case is dismissed,\" Dr. Morshead announced, after speaking for a\nmoment to his colleague. \"Unless there is any intention to charge these\nmen with resisting or assaulting officers, in the execution of their\nwarrant. It has been reported, though not formally, that some bystander\nwas considerably injured. If any charge is entered on either behalf, we\nare ready to receive the depositions.\"\n\nThe constables, who had been knocked about, were beginning to consult\ntogether, when Blickson slipped among them, after whispering to\nHerniman, and a good deal of nodding of heads took place, while\npleasant ideas were interchanged, such as, \"handsome private\ncompensation;\" \"twenty-five pounds to receive to-night, and such men are\nalways generous;\" \"a magnificent supper-party at the least, if they are\nfree. If not, all must come to nothing.\"\n\nThe worthy constabulary--now represented by a still worthier body, and\none of still finer feeling--perceived the full value of these arguments;\nand luckily for the accused, Dr. Gronow was not present, being sadly\noccupied at _Old Barn_.\n\n\"Although there is no charge, and no sign of any charge, your Worships,\nand therefore I have no _locus standi_;\" Mr. Blickson had returned to\nhis place, and adopted an airy and large-hearted style; \"I would crave\nthe indulgence of the Bench, for one or two quite informal remarks; my\nobject being to remove every stigma from the characters of my respected\nClients. On the best authority I may state, that their one desire, and\nintention, was to surrender, like a pair of lambs\"--at this description\na grin went round, and the learned Magistrates countenanced it--\"if they\ncould only realise the nature of the charge against them. But when they\ndemanded, like Englishmen, to know why their liberty should be suddenly\nabridged, what happened? No one answered them! All those admirable men\nwere doubtless eager to maintain the best traditions of the law; but the\nhurricane out-roared them. They laboured to convey their legal message;\nbut where is education, when the sky falls on its head? On the other\nhand, one of these law-abiding men had been engaged gloriously, in\nmaintaining the athletic honour of his county. This does not appear to\nhave raised in him at all the pugnacity, that might have been expected.\nHe strolled into the market-place, partly to stretch his poor bruised\nlegs, and partly perhaps, to relieve his mind; which men of smaller\nnature would have done, by tippling. Suddenly he is surrounded by a\ncrowd of very strong men in the dark. The Fair has long been over; the\nlights are burning low; scarcely enough of fire in them to singe the\nneck of an enterprising member of our brave Constabulary. In the thick\ndarkness, and hubbub of the storm, the hero who has redeemed the belt,\nand therewith the ancient fame of our county, supposes--naturally\nsupposes, charitable as his large mind is, that he is beset for the sake\nof the money, which he has not yet received, but intends to distribute\nso freely, when he gets it. The time of this honourable Bench is too\nvaluable to the public to be wasted over any descriptions of a petty\nskirmish, no two of which are at all alike. My large-bodied Client, the\nmighty wrestler, might have been expected to put forth his strength. It\nis certain that he did not do so. The man, who had smitten down the\npride of Cornwall, would strike not a blow against his own county. He\ngave a playful push or two, a chuck under the chin, such as a pretty\nmilkmaid gets, when she declines a sweeter touch. I marvel at his\nwonderful self-control. His knuckles were shattered by a blow from a\nstaff; like a roof in a hailstorm his great chest rang--for the men of\nPerliton can hit hard--yet is there anything to show that he even\nendeavoured to strike in return? And how did it end? In the very noblest\nway. The Pastor of the village, a most saintly man, but less than an\ninfant in Harvey Tremlett's hands, appears at the gate, when there is no\nother let or hindrance to the freedom of a Briton. Is he thrust aside\nrudely? Is he kicked out of the way? Nay, he lays a hand upon the big\nman's breast, the hand of a Minister of the Cross. He explains that the\nlaw, by some misapprehension, is fain to apprehend this simple-minded\nhero. The nature of the sad mistake is explained; and to use a common\nmetaphor, which excited some derision just now, but which I repeat, with\nfacts to back me,--gentle as a lamb, yonder lion surrenders!\"\n\n\"The lamb is very fortunate in his shepherd;\" said Dr. Morshead drily,\nas the lawyer sat down, under general applause. \"But there is nothing\nbefore the Bench, Mr. Blickson. What is the object of all this\neloquence?\"\n\n\"The object of my very simple narrative, your Worships, is to discharge\nmy plain duty to my clients. I would ask this Worshipful Bench, not only\nto dismiss a very absurd application, but also to add their most weighty\nopinions, that Harvey Tremlett, and James Fox--no, I beg pardon that was\nthe first mistake of this ever erroneous blacksmith--James Kettel, I\nshould say, have set a fine example of perfect submission to the law of\nthe land.\"\n\n\"Oh come, Mr. Blickson, that is out of the record. We pronounce no\nopinion upon that point. We simply adjudge that the case be now\ndismissed.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\n\nAN INLAND RUN.\n\n\n\"Won'erful well, 'e doed it, sir. If ever I gets into Queer Street, you\nbe the one to get me out.\"\n\nThis well-merited compliment was addressed by Dick Herniman to Attorney\nBlickson, at a convivial gathering held that same afternoon, to\ncelebrate the above recorded triumph of Astr\u00c3\u00a6a. The festal party had\nbeen convoked at the Wheatsheaf Tavern in Perliton Square, and had taken\nthe best room in the house, looking out of two windows upon that noble\nparallelogram, which Perliton never failed to bring with it, orally,\nwhen it condescended to visit Perlycross. The party had no idea of being\ntoo abstemious, the object of its existence being the promotion, as well\nas the assertion, of the liberty of the subject.\n\nSix individuals were combining for this lofty purpose, to wit the two\ngentlemen so unjustly charged, and their shrewd ally of high artistic\nstanding, that very able lawyer who had vindicated right; also Captain\nTimberlegs, and Horatio Peckover, Esquire; and pleasant it is as well as\nstrange to add, Master Joseph Crang of Susscot, blacksmith, farrier, and\nengineer. For now little differences of opinion, charges of perjury and\nbody-snatching, assault and battery, and general malfeasance, were sunk\nin the large liberality of success, the plenitude of John Barleycorn,\nand the congeniality of cordials.\n\nThat a stripling like the Hopper should be present was a proof of some\nfailure of discretion upon his part, for which he atoned by a tremendous\nimposition; while the prudent Pike, and the modest Mopuss, had refused\nwith short gratitude this banquet, and gone home. But the Hopper\nregarded himself as a witness--although he had not been called upon--in\nright of his researches at Blackmarsh, and declared that officially he\nmust hear the matter out, for an explanation had been promised. The\ngreater marvel was perhaps that Joe Crang should be there, after all the\nlash of tongue inflicted on him. But when their Worships were out of\nsight, Blickson had taken him by the hand, in a truly handsome manner,\nand assured him of the deep respect he felt, and ardent admiration, at\nhis too transparent truthfulness. Joe Crang, whose heart was very sore,\nhad shed a tear at this touching tribute, and was fain to admit, when\nthe lawyer put it so, that he was compelled in his own art to strike the\nfinest metal the hardest.\n\nSo now all six were in very sweet accord, having dined well, and now\nrefining the firmer substances into the genial flow. Attorney Blickson\nwas in the chair, for which nature had well qualified him; and perhaps\nin the present more ethereal age, he might have presided in a\n\"syndicate\" producing bubbles of gold and purple, subsiding into a bluer\ntone.\n\nFor this was a man of quick natural parts, and gifted in many ways for\nhis profession. Every one said that he should have been a Barrister; for\nhis character would not have mattered so much, when he went from one\ntown to another, and above all to such a place as London, where they\nthink but little of it. If he could only stay sober, and avoid\npromiscuous company, and make up his mind to keep his hand out of quiet\npeople's pockets, and do a few other respectable things, there was no\nearthly reason that any one could see, why he should not achieve fifty\nguineas a day, and even be a match for Mopuss K. C., the father of Mr.\nPenniloe's fattest pupil.\n\n\"This honourable company has a duty now before it;\" Mr. Blickson drew\nattention by rapping on the table, and then leaning back in his chair,\nwith a long pipe rested on a bowl of punch, or rather nothing but a\npunch-bowl now. On his right hand sat Herniman, the giver of the\nfeast--or the lender at least, till prize-money came to fist--and on the\nother side was Tremlett, held down by heavy nature from the higher\nflights of Bacchus, because no bowl was big enough to make him drunk;\n\"yes, a duty, gentlemen, which I, as the representative of Law cannot\nsee neglected. We have all enjoyed one another's 'good health,' in the\nway in which it concerns us most; we have also promoted, by such\nprayers, the weal of the good Squire Mockham, and that of another\ngentleman, who presented himself as _Amicus curi\u00c3\u00a6_--gentlemen, excuse a\nsample of my native tongue--a little prematurely perhaps last night, and\nleft us to sigh for him vainly to-day. I refer to the gentleman, with\nwhom another, happily now present, and the soul of our party, and\nrejoicing equally in the Scriptural name of James, was identified in an\nearly stage of this still mysterious history, by one of the most\nconscientious, truthful and self-possessed of all witnesses, I have ever\nhad the honour yet of handling in the box. At least he was not in the\nbox, because there was none; but he fully deserves to be kept in a box.\nI am sorry to see you smile--at my prolixity I fear; therefore I will\nrelieve you of it. Action is always more urgent than words. Duty demands\nthat we should have this bowl refilled. Pleasure, which is the fairer\nsex of duty, as every noble sailor knows too well, awaits us next in one\nof her most tempting forms, as an ancient Poet has observed. If it is\nsweet to witness from the shore the travail of another, how much sweeter\nto have his trials brought before us over the flowing bowl, while we\nrejoice in his success and share it. Gentlemen, I call upon Captain\nRichard Herniman for his promised narrative of that great expedition,\nwhich by some confusion of the public mind has become connected with a\ndarker enterprise. Captain Richard Herniman to the fore!\"\n\n\"Bain't no Cappen, and han't got no big words,\" said Timber-leg'd Dick,\ngetting up with a rattle, and standing very staunchly; \"but can't refuse\nthis here gentleman, under the circumstances. And every word as I says\nwill be true.\"\n\nAfter this left-handed compliment, received with a cheer in which the\nlawyer joined, the ancient salt premised that among good friends, he\nrelied on honour bright, that there should be no dirty turn. To this all\npledged themselves most freely; and he trusting rather in his own\nreservations than their pledge, that no harm should ever come of it,\nshortly told his story, which in substance was as follows. But some\nnames which he omitted have been filled in, now that all fear of enquiry\nis over.\n\nIn the previous September, when the nights were growing long, a\nsuccessful run across the Channel had been followed by a peaceful, and\nwell-conducted, landing at a lonely spot on the Devonshire coast, where\nthat pretty stream the Otter flows into the sea. That part of the shore\nwas very slackly guarded then; and none of the authorities got scent,\nwhile scent was hot, of this cordial international transaction. Some of\nthese genuine wares found a home promptly and pleasantly in the\nneighbourhood, among farmers, tradesmen, squires, and others, including\neven some loyal rectors, and zealous Justices of the Peace, or\nperadventure their wives and daughters capable of minding their own\nkeys. Some, after dwelling in caves, or furze-ricks, barns,\npotato-buries, or hollow trees, went inland, or to Sidmouth, or Seaton,\nor anywhere else where a good tax-payer had plastered up his windows, or\nput \"Dairy\" on the top of them.\n\nBut the prime of the cargo, and the very choicest goods, such as fine\nCognac, rich silk and rare lace, too good for pedlars, and too dear for\nCountry parsons still remained stored away very snugly, in some old dry\ncellars beneath the courtyard of a ruined house at Budleigh; where\nnobody cared to go poking about, because the old gentleman who lived\nthere once had been murdered nearly thirty years ago, for informing\nagainst smugglers, and was believed to be in the habit of walking there\nnow. These shrewd men perceived how just it was that he should stand\nguard in the spirit over that which in the flesh he had betrayed,\nespecially as his treason had been caused by dissatisfaction with his\nshare in a very fine contraband venture. Much was now committed to his\nposthumous sense of honour; for the free-traders vowed that they could\nmake a thousand pounds of these choice wares in any wealthy town, like\nBath, or Bristol, or even Weymouth, then more fashionable than it is\nnow.\n\nBut suddenly their bright hopes were dashed. Instead of reflecting on\nthe value of these goods, they were forced to take hasty measures for\ntheir safety. A very bustling man, of a strange suspicious turn, as dry\nas a mull of snuff, and as rough as a nutmeg-grater; in a word a\nScotchman out of sympathy with the natives, was appointed to the station\nat Sidmouth, and before he unpacked his clothes began to rout about,\nlike a dog who has been trained to hunt for morels. Very soon he came\nacross some elegant French work, in cottages, or fishers' huts, or on\nthe necks of milkmaids; and nothing would content him until he had\ndiscovered, even by such deep intriguery as the distribution of\nlollipops, the history of the recent enterprise.\n\n\"Let bygones be bygones,\" would have been the Christian sentiment of any\nnew-comer at all connected with the district; and Sandy MacSpudder must\nhave known quite well, that his curiosity was in the worst of taste, and\nthe result too likely to cast discredit on his own predecessor, who was\nthreatening to leave the world just then, with a large family unprovided\nfor. Yet such was this Scotchman's pertinacity and push, that even the\nlittle quiet village of Budleigh, which has nothing to do but to listen\nto its own brook prattling to the gently smiling valley, even this\nrose-fringed couch of peace was ripped up by the slashing of this rude\nLieutenant's cutlass. A spectre, even of the best Devonian antecedents,\nwas of less account than a scare-crow to this matter-of-fact Lowlander.\n\"A' can smell a rat in that ghostie,\" was his profane conclusion.\n\nThis put the spirited free-traders on their mettle. Fifty years ago,\nthat Scotch interloper would have learned the restful qualities of a\ngreener sod than his. But it is of interest to observe how the English\nnature softened, when the martial age had lapsed. It scarcely occurred\nto this gentler generation, that a bullet from behind a rock would send\nthis spry enquirer to solve larger questions on his own account. Savage\nbrutality had less example now.\n\nThe only thing therefore was to over-reach this man. He was watching all\nthe roads along the coast, to east and west; but to guard all the\ntangles of the inward roads, and the blessed complexity of Devonshire\nlanes would have needed an army of pure natives. Whereas this busy\nforeigner placed no faith in any man born in that part of the\nworld--such was his judgment--and had called for a draft of fellows\nhaving different vowels.\n\nThis being so, it served him right to be largely out-witted by the\nthick-heads he despised. And he had made such a fuss about it, at\nhead-quarters, and promised such wonders if the case were left to him,\nthat when he captured nothing but a string of worn-out kegs filled with\ndiluted sheep-wash, he not only suffered for a week from gastric\ntroubles--through his noseless hurry to identify Cognac--but also\nreceived a stinging reprimand, and an order for removal to a very rugged\ncoast, where he might be more at home with the language and the manners.\nAnd his predecessor's son obtained that sunny situation. Thus is zeal\nrewarded always, when it does not win the seal.\n\nNone will be surprised to hear that the simple yet masterly stratagem,\nby means of which the fair western county vindicated its commercial\nrights against northern arrogance and ignoble arts, was the invention of\na British Tar, an old Agamemnon, a true heart of oak, re-membered also\nin the same fine material. The lessons of Nelson had not been thrown\naway; this humble follower of that great hero first mis-led the\nadversary, and then broke his line. Invested as he was by superior\nforces seeking access even to his arsenal, he despatched to the eastward\na lumbering craft, better known to landsmen as a waggon, heavily laden\nwith straw newly threshed, under which was stowed a tier of ancient\nkegs, which had undergone too many sinkings in the sea (when a landing\nproved unsafe) to be trusted any more with fine contents. Therefore they\nnow contained sheep-wash, diluted from the brook to the complexion of\nold brandy. In the loading of this waggon special mystery was observed,\nwhich did not escape the vigilance of the keen lieutenant's watchmen.\nWith a pair of good farm-horses, and a farm-lad on the ridge of the\nload, and a heavy fellow whistling not too loudly on the lade-rail, this\nharmless car of fictitious Bacchus, crowned by effete Ceres, wended its\nrustic way towards the lowest bridge of Otter, a classic and idyllic\nstream. These two men, of pastoral strain and richest breadth of\nlanguage, carried orders of a simplicity almost equal to their own.\n\nNo sooner was this waggon lost to sight and hearing in the thick October\nnight, and the spies sped away by the short cuts to report it, than a\nlong light cart, with a strong out-stepping horse, came down the wooded\nvalley to the ghostly court. In half an hour, it was packed, and started\ninland, passing the birthplace of a very great man, straight away to\nFarringdon and Rockbear, with orders to put up at Clist Hidon before\ndaylight, where lived a farmer who would harbour them securely. On the\nfollowing night they were to make their way, after shunning Cullompton,\nto the shelter in Blackmarsh, where they would be safe from all\nintrusion, and might await fresh instructions, which would take them\nprobably towards Bridgwater, and Bristol. By friendly ministrations of\nthe Whetstone men, who had some experience in trade of this description,\nall this was managed with the best success; Jem Kettel knew the country\nroads, by dark as well as daylight, and Harvey Tremlett was not a man to\nbe collared very easily. In fact, without that sad mishap to their very\nwilling and active nag, they might have fared through Perlycross, as\nthey had through other villages, where people wooed the early pillow,\nwithout a trace or dream of any secret treasure passing.\n\nMeanwhile at Sidmouth the clever Scotchman was enjoying his own\nacuteness. He allowed that slowly rolling waggon of the Eleusine dame to\nproceed some miles upon its course, before his men stood at the horses'\nheads. There was wisdom in this, as well as pleasure--the joy a cat\nprolongs with mouse--inasmuch as all these good things were approaching\nhis own den of spoil. When the Scotchmen challenged the Devonshire\nswains, with flourish of iron, and of language even harder, an\ninterpreter was sorely needed. Not a word could the Northmen understand\nthat came from the broad soft Southron tongues; while the Devonshire men\nfeigning, as they were bidden, to take them for highwaymen, feigned also\nnot to know a syllable of what they said.\n\nThis led, as it was meant to do, to very lavish waste of time, and\nincrement of trouble. The carters instead of lending hand for the\nunloading of their waggon, sadly delayed that operation, by shouting out\n\"thaves!\" at the top of their voice, tickling their horses into a wild\nstart now and then, and rolling the Preventive men off at the tail.\nMacSpudder himself had a narrow escape; for just when he chanced to be\nbetween two wheels, both of them set off, without a word of notice; and\nif he had possessed at all a western body, it would have been run over.\nBeing made of corkscrew metal by hereditary right, he wriggled out as\nsound as ever; and looked forward all the more to the solace underlying\nthis reluctant pile, as dry as any of his own components.\n\nNothing but his own grunts can properly express the fattening of his\nself-esteem (the whole of which was home-fed) when his men, without a\nfork--for the Boreal mind had never thought of that--but with a great\nmany chops of knuckles (for the skin of straw is tougher than a\nScotchman's) found their way at midnight, like a puzzled troop of\ndivers, into the reef at bottom of the sheefy billows. Their throats\nwere in a husky state, from chaff too penetrative, and barn-dust over\nvolatile, and they risked their pulmonary weal, by opening a too\nsanguine cheer.\n\n\"Duty compels us to test the staple;\" the Officer in command decreed;\nand many mouths gaped round the glow of his bullseye. \"Don't 'ee titch\nnone of that their wassh!\" The benevolent Devonians exclaimed in vain.\nWant of faith prevailed; every man suspected the verdict of his\npredecessor, and even his own at first swallow. If timber-leg'd Dick\ncould have timed the issue, what a landing he might have made! For the\nCoast-guard tested staple so that twenty miles of coast were left free\nfor fifty hours.\n\nHaving told these things in his gravest manner, Herniman, who so well\ncombined the arts of peace and war, filled another pipe, and was open to\nenquiry. Everybody accepted his narrative with pleasure, and heartily\nwished him another such a chance of directing fair merchandise along the\nlanes of luck. The blacksmith alone had some qualms of conscience, for\napparent back-slidings from the true faith of free-trade. But they\nclapped him on the back, and he promised with a gulp, that he never\nwould peep into a Liberal Van again.\n\n\"There is one thing not quite clear to me;\" said the Hopper, when the\nman of iron was settled below the table, whereas the youth had kept\nhimself in trim for steeple-chasing. \"What could our friend have seen in\nthat vehicle of free-trade, to make him give that horrible account of\nits contents? And again, why did Mr. Harvey Tremlett carry off that tool\nof his, which I found in the water?\"\n\nWith a wave of his hand--for his tongue had now lost, by one of nature's\nfinest arrangements, the exuberance of the morning, whereas a man of\nsober silence would now have gushed into bright eloquence--the chairman\ndeputed to Herniman, and Tremlett, the honour of replying to the\nHopper.\n\n\"You see, sir,\" said the former, \"it was just like this. We was hurried\nso in stowing cargo, that some of the finest laces in the world, such as\nthey call _Valentines_, worth maybe fifty or a hundred pounds a yard,\nwas shot into the hold anyhow, among a lot of silks and so on. Harvey,\nand Jemmy, was on honour to deliver goods as they received them;\nblacksmith seed some of this lace a'flappin' under black tarporly; and\nhe knowed as your poor Squire had been figged out for 's last voyage\nwith same sort of stuff, only not so good. A clever old 'ooman maketh\nsome, to Perlycrass; Honiton lace they calls it here. What could a'\nthink but that Squire was there? Reckon, Master Crang would a' told 'e\nthis, if so be a' hadn't had a little drap too much.\"\n\n\"Thou bee'st a liar. Han't had half enough, I tell 'e.\" The blacksmith\nfrom under the table replied, and then rolled away into a bellowsful of\nsnores.\n\n\"To be sure!\" said Peckover. \"I see now. Tamsin Tamlin's work it was.\nSergeant Jakes told me all about it. With all the talk there had been of\nrobbing graves, and two men keeping in the dark so, no wonder Crang\nthought what he did. Many people went to see that lace, I heard; and\nthey said it was too good to go underground; though nothing could be too\ngood for the Squire. Well now, about that other thing--why did Mr.\nTremlett make off with _little Billy_?\"\n\n\"Can't tell 'e, sir, very much about 'un;\" the wrestler answered, with a\nlaugh at the boy's examination. \"Happen I tuk 'un up, a'veelin' of 'un,\nto frighten blacksmith maybe; and then I vancied a' maight come handy\nlike, if nag's foot went wrong again. Then when nag gooed on all right,\nI just chucked 'un into a pool of watter, for to kape 'un out o' sight\nof twisty volk. Ort more to zatisfy this yung gent?\"\n\n\"Yes. I am a twisty folk, I suppose. Unless there is any objection, I\nshould like very much to know why Dr. Fox was sent on that fool's errand\nto the pits.\"\n\n\"Oh, I can tell 'e that, sir,\" replied Jem Kettel, for the spirit of the\nlad, and his interest in their doings, had made him a favourite with\nthe present company. \"It were one of my mates as took too much trouble.\nHe were appointed to meet us at the cornder of the four roads, an hour\nafore that or more; and he got in a bit of a skear, it seems not knowing\nwhy we was so behindhand. But he knowed Dr. Vox, and thought 'un better\nout o' way, being such a sharp chap, and likely to turn meddlesome. He\ndidn't want 'un to hang about up street, as a' maight with some sick\n'ooman, and so he zent un' t'other road, to tend a little haxident.\nWouldn't do he no harm, a' thought, and might zave us some bother. But,\nLord! if us could have only knowed the toorn your volk would putt on it,\nI reckon us should have roared and roared, all droo the strates of\nPerlycrass. Vainest joke as ever coom to my hearin', or ever wull,\nhowever long the Lord kapeth me a'livin'. And to think of Jem Kettel\nbeing sworn to for a learned Doctor! Never had no teethache I han't,\nsince the day I heered on it.\" A hearty laugh was held to be a sovereign\ncure for toothache then, and perhaps would be so still, if the patient\ncould accomplish it.\n\n\"Well, so far as that goes, you have certainly got the laugh of us;\"\nMaster Peckover admitted, not forgetting that he himself came in for as\nmuch as any one. \"But come now, as you are so sharp, just give me your\ngood opinion. And you being all along the roads that night, ought to\nhave seen something. Who were the real people in that horrid business?\"\n\n\"The Lord in heaven knoweth, sir;\" said Tremlett very solemnly. \"Us\npassed in front of Perlycrass church, about dree o'clock of the morning.\nNort were doing then, or us could scarcely have helped hearing of it.\nEven if 'em heered our wheels, and so got out of sight, I reckon, us\nmust a' seed the earth-heap, though moon were gone a good bit afore\nthat. And zim'th there waz no harse there. A harse will sing out a'most\nalways to another harse at night, when a' heareth of him coming, and a'\nstandeth lonely. Us coom athert ne'er chick nor cheeld from Perlycrass\nto Blackmarsh. As to us and Clam-pit volk, zoonder would us goo to\ngallows than have ort to say to grave-work. And gallows be too good for\n'un, accardin' my opinion. But gen'lemen, afore us parts, I wants to\ndrink the good health of the best man I've a knowed on airth. Bain't\nsaying much perhaps, for my ways hath been crooked like. But maketh any\nkearless chap belave in good above 'un, when a hap'th acrass a man as\nthinketh nort of his own zell, but gi'eth his life to other volk. God\nbless Passon Penniloe!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\n\nNEEDFUL RETURNS.\n\n\nNow it happened that none of these people, thus rejoicing in the liberty\nof the subject, had heard of the very sad state of things, mainly caused\nby their own acts, and now prevailing at _Old Barn_. Tremlett knew that\nhe had struck a vicious blow, at the head of a man who had grappled him,\nbut he thought he had missed it and struck something else, a bag, or a\nhat, or he knew not what, in the pell mell scuffle and the darkness. His\nturn of mind did not incline him to be by any means particular as to his\nconduct, in a hot and hard personal encounter; but knowing his vast\nstrength he generally abstained from the use of heavy weapons, while his\ntemper was his own. But in this hot struggle, he had met with a mutually\nshattering blow from a staff, as straight as need be upon his right-hand\nknuckles; and the pain from this, coupled with the wrath aroused at the\naccess of volunteer enemies, had carried him--like the raging elements\noutside--out of all remembrance of the true \"sacredness of humanity.\" He\nstruck out, with a sense of not doing the right thing, which is always\nstrengthened afterwards; and his better stars being ablink in the gale,\nand the other man's gone into the milky way, he hit him too hard; which\nis a not uncommon error.\n\nMany might have reasoned (and before all others, Harvey Tremlett's wife,\nif still within this world of reason; and a bad job it was for him that\nshe was now outside it) that nothing could be nobler, taking people as\nwe find them--and how else can we get the time to take them?--than the\nbehaviour of this champion wrestler. But, without going into such sweet\nlogic of affinity, and rhetoric of friends (whose minds have been made\nup in front of it) there was this crushing fact to meet, that an\ninnocent man's better arm was in a smash.\n\nNo milder word, however medical, is fit to apply to Frank Gilham's poor\nfore-arm. They might call it the _ulna_--for a bit of Latin is a solace,\nto the man who feels the pain in a brother Christian's member--and they\nmight enter nobly into fine nerves of anatomy; but the one-sided\ndifficulty still was there--they had got to talk about it; he had got to\nbear it.\n\nNot that he made any coward outcry of it. A truer test of manliness (as\nhas been often said, by those who have been through either trial), truer\nthan the rush of blood and reckless dash of battle, is the calm,\nopen-eyed, and firm-fibred endurance of long, ever-grinding,\nnever-graduating pain. The pain that has no pang, or paroxysm, no\ngenerosity to make one cry out \"Well done!\" to it, and be thankful to\nthe Lord that it must have done its worst; but a fluid that keeps up a\nslow boil, by day and night, and never lifts the pot-lid, and never\nwhirls about, but keeps up a steady stew of flesh, and bone, and marrow.\n\n\"I fear there is nothing for it, but to have it off,\" Dr. Gronow said,\nupon the third day of this frightful anguish. He had scarcely left the\npatient for an hour at a time; and if he had done harsh things in his\nbetter days, no one would believe it of him, who could see him now. \"It\nwas my advice at first, you know; but you would not have it, Jemmy. You\nare more of a surgeon than I am. But I doubt whether you should risk his\nlife, like this.\"\n\n\"I am still in hopes of saving it. But you see how little I can do,\"\nreplied Fox, whose voice was very low, for he was suffering still from\nthat terrible concussion, and but for the urgency of Gilham's case, he\nwould now have been doctoring the one who pays the worst for it. \"If I\nhad my proper touch, and strength of nerve, I never should have let it\ncome to this. There is a vile bit of splinter that won't come in, and I\nam not firm enough to make it. I wish I had left it to you, as you\noffered. After all, you know much more than we do.\"\n\n\"No, my dear boy. It is your special line. Such a case as Lady Waldron's\nI might be more at home with. I should have had the arm off long ago.\nBut the mother--the mother is such a piteous creature? What has become\nof all my nerve? I am quite convinced that fly-fishing makes a man too\ngentle. I cannot stand half the things I once thought nothing of.\nBy-the-by, couldn't you counteract her? You know the old proverb--\n\n\n     'One woman rules the men;\n     Two makes them think again,'\n\n\nIt would be the best thing you could do.\"\n\n\"I don't see exactly what you mean,\" answered Jemmy, who had lost nearly\nall of his sprightliness.\n\n\"Plainer than a pikestaff. Send for your sister. You owe it to yourself,\nand her; and most of all to the man who has placed his life in peril, to\nsave yours. It is not a time to be too finical.\"\n\n\"I have thought of it once or twice. She would be of the greatest\nservice now. But I don't much like to ask her. Most likely she would\nrefuse to come, after the way in which I packed her off.\"\n\n\"My dear young friend,\" said Dr. Gronow, looking at him steadfastly, \"if\nthat is all you have to say, you don't deserve a wife at all worthy of\nthe name. In the first place, you won't sink your own little pride; and\nin the next, you have no idea what a woman is.\"\n\n\"Young Farrant is the most obliging fellow in the world,\" replied Fox,\nafter thinking for a minute. \"I will put him on my young mare _Perle_,\nwho knows the way; and he'll be at Foxden before dark. If Chris likes to\ncome, she can be here well enough, by twelve or one o'clock to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Like, or no like, I'll answer for her coming; and I'll answer for her\nnot being very long about it,\" said the senior doctor; and on both\npoints he was right.\n\nChristie was not like herself, when she arrived, but pale, and timid,\nand trembling. Her brother had not mentioned Frank in his letter,\ndoubting the turn she might take about it, and preferring that she\nshould come to see to himself, which was her foremost duty. But young\nMr. Farrant, the Churchwarden's son, and pretty Minnie's brother, had no\nembargo laid upon his tongue; and had there been fifty, what could they\nhave availed to debar such a clever young lady? She had cried herself\nto sleep, when she knew all, and dreamed it a thousand times worse than\nit was.\n\nNow she stood in the porch of the _Old Barn_, striving, and sternly\ndetermined to show herself rational, true to relationship, sisterly, and\nnothing more. But her white lips, quick breath, and quivering eyelids,\nwere not altogether consistent with that. Instead of amazement, when\nMrs. Gilham came to meet her, and no Jemmy, she did not even feign to be\nsurprised, but fell into the bell-sleeves (which were fine things for\nembracing) and let the deep throbs of her heart disclose a tale that is\nbetter felt than told.\n\n\"My dearie,\" said the mother, as she laid the damask cheek against the\nwrinkled one, and stroked the bright hair with the palm of her hand,\n\"don't 'e give way, that's a darling child. It will all be so different\nnow you are come. It was what I was longing for, day and night, but\ncould not bring myself to ask. And I felt so sure in my heart, my dear,\nhow sorry you would be for him.\"\n\n\"I should think so. I can't tell you. And all done for Jemmy, who was so\nungrateful! My brother would be dead, if your son was like him. There\nhas never been anything half so noble, in all the history of the world.\"\n\n\"My dear, you say that, because you think well of our Frankie--I have\nnot called him that, since Tuesday now. But you do think well of him,\ndon't you now?\"\n\n\"Don't talk to me of thinking well indeed! I never can endure those weak\nexpressions. When I like people, I do like them.\"\n\n\"My dear, it reminds me quite of our own country, to hear you speak out\nso hearty. None of them do it up your way, much; according to what I\nhear of them. I feel it so kind of you, to like Frank Gilham.\"\n\n\"Well! am I never to be understood? Is there no meaning in the English\nlanguage? I don't like him only. But with all my heart, I love him.\"\n\n\"He won't care if doctors cut his arm off now, if he hath one left to go\nround you.\"\n\nThe mother sobbed a little, with second fiddle in full view; but being\nstill a mother, wiped her eyes, and smiled with content at the\ninevitable thing.\n\n\"One thing remember,\" said the girl, with a coaxing domestic smile, and\nyet a lot of sparkle in her eyes; \"if you ever tell him what you twisted\nout of me, in a manner which I may call--well, too circumstantial--I am\nafraid that I never should forgive you. I am awfully proud, and I can be\ntremendous. Perhaps he would not even care to hear it. And then what\nwould become of me? Can you tell me that?\"\n\n\"My dear, you know better. You know, as well as I do, that ever since he\nsaw you, he has thought of nothing else. It has made me feel ashamed,\nthat I should have a son capable of throwing over all the world\nbeside----\"\n\n\"But don't you see, that is the very thing I like? Noble as he is, if it\nwere not for that, I--well, I won't go into it; but you ought to\nunderstand. He can't think half so much of me, as I do of him.\"\n\n\"Then there is a pair of you. And the Lord has made you so. But never\nfear, my pretty. Not a whisper shall he have. You shall tell him all\nabout it, with your own sweet lips.\"\n\n\"As if I could do that indeed! Why, Mrs. Gilham, was that what you used\nto do, when you were young? I thought people were ever so much more\nparticular in those days.\"\n\n\"I can hardly tell, my dear. Sometimes I quite forget, because it seems\nso long ago; and at other times I'm not fit to describe it, because I am\ndoing it over again. But for pretty behaviour, and nice ways--nice\npeople have them in every generation; and you may take place with the\nbest of them. But we are talking, as if nothing was the matter. And you\nhave never asked even how we are going on!\"\n\n\"Because I know all about it, from the best authority. Coming up the\nhill we met Dr. Gronow, and I stopped the chaise to have a talk with\nhim. He does not think the arm will ever be much good again; but he\nleaves it to younger men, to be certain about anything. That was meant\nfor Jemmy, I suppose. He would rather have the pain, than not, he says;\nmeaning of course in the patient--not himself. It shows healthy\naction--though I can't see how--and just the proper quantity of\ninflammation, which I should have thought couldn't be too little. He has\ncome round to Jemmy's opinion this morning, that if one--something or\nother--can be got to stay in its place, and not do something or\nother--the poor arm may be saved, after all; though never as strong as\nit was before. He says it must have been a frightful blow. I hope that\nman will be punished for it heavily.\"\n\n\"I hope so too, with all my heart; though I am not revengeful. Mr.\nPenniloe was up here yesterday, and he tried to make the best of it. I\nwas so vexed that I told him, he would not be quite such a Christian\nabout it perhaps, if he had the pain in his own arm. But he has made the\nman promise to give himself up, if your brother, or my son, require it.\nI was for putting him in jail at once, but the others think it better to\nwait a bit. But as for his promise, I wouldn't give much for that.\nHowever, men manage those things, and not women. Did the doctor say\nwhether you might see my Frankie?\"\n\n\"He said I might see Jemmy; though Jemmy is very queer. But as for\nFrank, if I saw him through a chink in the wall, that would be quite\nenough. But he must not see me, unless it was with a telescope through a\ntwo-inch door. That annoyed me rather. As if we were such babies! But he\nsaid that you were a most sensible woman, and that was the advice you\ngave him.\"\n\n\"What a story! Oh my dear, never marry a doctor--though I hope you will\nnever have the chance--but they really don't seem to care what they say.\nIt was just the same in my dear husband's time. Dr. Gronow said to\nme--'if she comes when I am out, don't let her go near either of them.\nShe might do a lot of mischief. She might get up an argument, or\nsomething.' And so, I said----\"\n\n\"Oh, Mrs. Gilham, that is a great deal worse than telling almost any\nstory. An argument! Do I ever argue? I had better have stayed away, if\nthat is the way they think of me. A telescope and a two-inch door, and\nnot be allowed perhaps to open my mouth! There is something exceedingly\nunjust in the opinions men entertain of women.\"\n\n\"Not my Frank, my dear. That is where he differs from all the other\nyoung men in the world. He has the most correct and yet exalted views;\nsuch as poets had, when there were any. If you could only hear him going\non about you, before he got that wicked knock I mean, of course,--his\nopinions not only of your hair and face, nor even your eyes, though all\nperfectly true, but your mind, and your intellect, and disposition, and\npower of perceiving what people are, and then your conversation--almost\ntoo good for us, because of want of exercise--and then, well I really\nforget what came next.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mrs. Gilham, it is all so absurd! How could he talk such nonsense?\nI don't like to hear of such things; and I cannot believe there could be\nanything, to come next.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, there was, my dear, now you remind me of it. It was about the\nsmall size of your ears, and the lovely curves inside them. He had found\nout in some ancient work,--for I believe he could hold his own in Greek\nand Latin, even with Mr. Penniloe,--that a well-shaped ear is one of the\nrarest of all feminine perfections. That made him think no doubt of\nyours, for men are quite babies when they are in love; and he found\nyours according to the highest standard. Men seem to make all those\nrules about us, simply according to their own ideas! What rules do we\never make about them?\"\n\n\"I am so glad that you look at things in that way,\" Christie answered,\nwith her fingers going slyly up her hair, to let her ears know what was\nthought of them; \"because I was afraid that you were too much--well\nperhaps that thinking so much of your son, you might look at things\none-sidedly. And yet I might have known from your unusual common\nsense--but I do believe Dr. Gronow is coming back; and I have not even\ngot my cloak off! Wait a bit, till things come round a little. A\ntelescope, and a two-inch door! One had better go about in a coal-sack,\nand curl-papers. Not that I ever want such things,--curves enough in my\nears perhaps. But really I must make myself a little decent. They have\ntaken my things up to my old room, I suppose. Try to keep him here, till\nI come back. He says that I get up arguments. Let me get up one with\nhim.\"\n\n\"My orders are as stern as they are sensible;\" Dr. Gronow declared, when\nshe had returned, beautifully dressed and charming, and had thus\nattacked him with even more of blandishment than argument; \"Your brother\nyou may see, but not to talk much at one time to him; for his head is\nin a peculiar state, and he does much more than he ought to do. He\ninsists upon doing everything, which means perpetual attention to his\nfriend. But he does it all as if by instinct, apparently without knowing\nit; and that he should do it all to perfection, is a very noble proof of\nthe thoroughness of his grounding. The old school, the old school of\ntraining--there is nothing like it after all. Any mere sciolist, any\nempiric, any smatterer of the new medical course--and where would Frank\nGilham's arm be now? Not in a state of lenitive pain, sanative, and in\nsome degree encouraging, but in a condition of incipient mortification.\nFor this is a case of compound comminuted fracture; so severe that my\nown conviction was--however no more of that to you two ladies. Only feel\nassured that no more could be done for the patient in the best hospital\nin London. And talking of upstart schools indeed, and new-fangled\neducation, have you heard what the boys have done at Perlycross? I heard\nthe noise upstairs, and I was obliged to shut the window, although it is\nsuch a soft spring-day. I was going down the hill to stop it, when I met\nMiss Fox. It is one of the most extraordinary jokes I ever knew.\"\n\n\"Oh, do tell us. We have not heard a word about it. But I am beginning\nto think that this is not at all a common place. I am never surprised at\nanything that happens at Perlycross.\" This was not a loyal speech on the\npart of the fair Christie.\n\n\"From what I have heard of that Moral Force-man,\" Mrs. Gilham remarked,\nwith slow shake of her head; \"I fear that his system would work better\nin a future existence, than as we are now. From what my son told me,\nbefore his accident, I foresaw that it must lead up to something quite\noutrageous. Nothing ever answers long, that goes against all the wisdom\nof our ancestors.\"\n\n\"Excuse me for a minute; I must first see how things are going on\nupstairs. As soon as I am at liberty, I will tell you what I saw. Though\nI like the march of intellect, when discipline directs it.\"\n\nDr. Gronow, who was smiling, which he seldom was, except after whirling\nout a two-ounce trout, went gently upstairs and returned in a few\nminutes, and sat down to tell his little tale.\n\n\"Every thing there going on as well as can be. Your brother is\ndelighted to hear that you are come. But the other patient must not hear\na word about it yet. We don't want any rapid action of the heart. Well,\nwhat the young scamps have done is just this. The new schoolmaster has\nabolished canes, you know, and birches, and every kind of physical\ncompulsion. He exclaims against coercion, and pronounces that boys are\nto be guided by their hearts, instead of being governed by their--pardon\nme, a word not acknowledged in the language of these loftier days. This\ngentleman seems to have abolished the old system of the puerile body and\nmind, without putting anything of cogency in its place. He has\nintroduced novelties, very excellent no doubt, if the boys would only\ntake to them, with intellects as lofty as his own. But that is the very\nthing the boys won't do. I am a Liberal--so far as feelings go, when not\noverpowered by the judgment--but I must acknowledge that the best\nextremes of life, the boyhood made of nature, and the age made of\nexperience, are equally staunch in their Toryism. But this man's great\nword is--Reform. As long as the boys thought it meant their benches, and\nexpected to have soft cushions on them, they were highly pleased, and\nlooked forward to this tribute to a part which had hitherto been\nanything but sacred. Their mothers too encouraged it, on account of wear\nand tear; but their fathers could not see why they should sit softer at\ntheir books, than they had to do at their trenchers.\n\n\"But yesterday unluckily the whole of it came out. There arrived a great\npackage, by old Hill the carrier, who has had his van mended that was\nblown over, and out rushed the boys, without asking any leave, to bring\nin their comfortable cushions. All they found was a great blackboard,\nswinging on a pillar, with a socket at the back, and a staple and chain\nto adjust it. Toogood expected them to be in raptures, but instead of\nthat they all went into sulks; and the little fellows would not look at\nit, having heard of black magic and witchcraft. Toogood called it a\n'Demonstration-table, for the exhibition of Object-lessons.'\n\n\"Mr. Penniloe, as you may suppose, had long been annoyed and unhappy\nabout the new man's doings, but he is not supreme in the week-day\nschool, as he is on Sunday; and he tried to make the best of it, till\nthe right man should come home. And I cannot believe that he went away\non purpose to-day, in order to let them have it out. But the boys found\nout that he was going, and there is nobody else they care twopence for.\n\n\"Everybody says, except their mothers, that they must have put their\nheads together over-night, or how could they have acted with such unity\nand precision? Not only in design but in execution, the accomplished\ntactician stands confessed. Instead of attacking the enemy at once, when\nmany might have hastened to his rescue, they deferred operations until\nto-day, and even then waited for the proper moment. They allowed him to\nexhaust all the best of his breath in his usual frothy oration--for like\nmost of such men he can spout for ever, and finds it much easier than\ncareful teaching.\n\n\"Then as he leaned back, with pantings in his chest, and eyes turned up\nat his own eloquence, two of the biggest boys flung a piece of\nclothes-line round his arms from behind, and knotted it, while another\nslipped under the desk, and buckled his ankles together with a\nsatchel-strap, before he knew what he was doing. Then as he began to\nshout and bellow, scarcely yet believing it, they with much panting and\nblowing, protrusion of tongues, and grunts of exertion, some working at\nhis legs, and some shouldering at his loins, and others hauling on the\nclothes-line, but all with perfect harmony of action, fetched their\npreceptor to the Demonstration-board, and laying him with his back flat\nagainst it, strapped his feet to the pedestal; then pulling out the\nstaple till the board was perpendicular, they secured his coat-collar to\nthe shaft above it, and there he was--as upright as need be, but without\nthe power to move, except at his own momentous peril. Then to make quite\nsure of him, a clever little fellow got upon a stool, and drew back his\nhair, bright red, and worn long like a woman's, and tied it with a\nbook-tape behind the pillar. You may imagine how the poor preceptor\nlooks. Any effort of his to release himself will crush him beneath the\ngreat Demonstration, like a mouse in a figure-of-four trap.\"\n\n\"But are we to believe, Dr. Gronow,\" asked Christie, \"that you came\naway, and left the poor man in that helpless state?\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly I did. It is no concern of mine. And the boys had only just\ngot their pea-shooters. He has not had half enough to cure him yet.\nBesides, they had my promise; for the boys have got the keys, they are\ncharging a penny for a view of this Reformer; but they won't let any one\nin without a promise of strict neutrality. I gave a shilling, for I am\nsure they have deserved it. Somebody will be sure to cast him loose, in\nplenty of time for his own good. This will be of the greatest service to\nhim, and cure him for a long time of big words.\"\n\n\"But suppose he falls forward upon his face, and the board falls upon\nhim and suffocates him. Why, it would be the death of Mr. Penniloe. You\nare wanted here of course, Dr. Gronow; but I shall put my bonnet on, and\nrush down the hill, to the release of the Higher Education.\"\n\n\"Don't rush too fast, Miss Fox. There's a tree blown down across the\nlane, after you turn out of the one you came by. We ought to have had it\ncleared, but they say it will take a fortnight to make some of the main\nroads passable again. I would not go, if I were you. Somebody will have\nset him free, before you get there. I'll go out and listen. With the\nwind in the north, we can hear their hurrah-ing quite plainly at the\ngate. You can come with me, if you like.\"\n\n\"Oh, it is no hurrahing, Dr. Gronow! How can you deceive me so? It is a\nvery sad sound indeed;\" said Christie, as they stood at the gate, and\nshe held her pretty palms to serve as funnels for her much admired ears.\n\"It sounds like a heap of boys weeping and wailing. I fear that\nsomething sadly vindictive has been done. One never can have a bit of\ntriumph, without that.\"\n\nShe scarcely knew the full truth of her own words. It was indeed an\nepoch of Nemesis. This fourth generation of boys in that village are\nbeginning to be told of it, on knees that shake, with time, as well as\nmemory. And thus it befell.\n\n\"What, lock me out of my own school-door! Can't come in, without I pay\na penny! May do in Spain; but won't do here.\"\n\nA strong foot was thrust into the double of the door, a rattle of the\nhandle ran up the lock and timber, and conscience made a coward of the\nboy that took the pennies. An Odic Force, as the present quaky period\ncalls it, permeated doubtless from the Master hand. Back went the boy,\nand across him strode a man, rather tall, wiry, torve of aspect,\nhyporrhined with a terse moustache, hatted with a vast sombrero. At a\nglance he had the whole situation in his eye, and his heart,--worst of\nall, in his strong right arm. He flung off a martial cloak, that might\nhave cumbered action, stood at the end of the long desk, squared his\nshoulders and eyebrows, and shouted--\n\n\"Boys, here's a noise!\"\n\nAs this famous battle-cry rang through the room, every mother's darling\nknew what was coming. Consternation is too weak a word. Grinning mouths\nfell into graves of terror, castaway pea-shooters quivered on the floor,\nfat legs rattled in their boots, and flew about, helter-skelter,\nanywhere, to save their dear foundations. Vain it was; no vanishing\npoint could be discovered. Wisdom was come, to be justified of her\nchildren.\n\nThe schoolmaster of the ancient school marched with a grim smile to the\ndoor, locked it, and pocketed the key. Three little fellows, untaught as\nyet the expediency of letting well alone, had taken the bunch of keys,\nand brought forth, and were riding disdainfully the three canes dormant\nunder the new dispensation. \"Bring me those implements,\" commanded\nSergeant Jakes, \"perhaps they may do--to begin with.\" He arranged them\nlovingly, and then spoke wisely.\n\n\"My dear young friends, it is very sad to find, that while I have been\nin foreign parts, you have not been studying discipline. The gentleman,\nwhom you have treated thus, will join me, I trust, by the time I have\ndone, in maintaining that I do not bear the rod in vain. Any boy who\ncrawls under a desk may feel assured that he will get it ten times\nworse.\"\n\nPity draws a mourning veil, though she keeps a place to peep through,\nwhen her highly respected cousin, Justice, is thus compelled to assert\nherself. Enough that very few indeed of the highly cultured boys of\nPerlycross showed much aptitude that week for sedentary employment.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL.\n\nHOME AND FOREIGN.\n\n\nSix weeks was the average time allowed for the voyage to and fro of the\nschooner _Montilla_ (owned by Messrs. Besley of Exeter) from Topsham to\nCadiz, or wherever it might be; and little uneasiness was ever felt, if\nher absence extended to even three months. For Spaniards are not in the\nawkward habit of cracking whips at old Time, when he is out at grass,\nmuch less of jumping at his forelock; and Iberian time is nearly always\nout at grass. When a thing will not help to do itself to-day, who knows\nthat it may not be in a kinder mood to-morrow? The spirit of worry, and\nunreasonable hurry, is a deadly blast to all serenity of mind and\ndignity of demeanour, and can be in harmony with nothing but bad\nweather. Thus the _Montilla's_ period was a fluctuating numeral.\n\nAs yet English produce was of high repute, and the Continent had not\nbeen barb-wired by ourselves, against our fleecy merchandise. The\nSpaniards happened to be in the vein for working, and thus on this\nwinter trip the good trader's hold was quickly cleared of English\nsolids, and refilled with Spanish fluids; and so the _Montilla_ was\nready for voyage homeward the very day her passenger rejoined. This\npleased him well, for he was anxious to get back, though not at all\naware of the urgent need arising. Luckily for him and for all on board,\nthe schooner lost a day in getting out to sea, and thus ran into the\nrough fringes only of the great storm that swept the English coast and\nchannel. In fact she made good weather across the Bay of Biscay, and\nswang into her berth at Topsham, several days before she was counted\ndue.\n\nThe Sergeant's first duty was, of course, to report himself at\nWalderscourt; and this he had done, before he made that auspicious\nre-entry upon his own domain. The ladies did not at all expect to see\nhim, for days or even weeks to come, having heard nothing whatever of\nhis doings; for the post beyond France was so uncertain then, that he\nwent away with orders not to write.\n\nWhen Jakes was shown into the room, Lady Waldron was sitting alone, and\nmuch agitated by a letter just received from Mr. Webber, containing his\nopinion of all that had happened at Perliton on Wednesday. Feeling her\nunfitness for another trial, she sent for her daughter, before\npermitting the envoy to relate his news. Then she strove to look calmly\nat him, and to maintain her cold dignity as of yore; but the power was\nno longer in her. Months of miserable suspense, perpetual brooding, and\nwant of sleep, had lowered the standard of her pride; and nothing but a\nburst of painful sobs saved her from a worse condition.\n\nThe Sergeant stood hesitating by the door, feeling that he had no\ninvitation to see this, and not presuming to offer comfort. But Miss\nWaldron seeing the best thing to do, called him, and bade him tell his\nnews in brief.\n\n\"May it please your ladyship,\" the veteran began, staring deeply into\nhis new Spanish hat, about which he had received some compliments; \"all\nI have to tell your ladyship is for the honour of the family. Your\nladyship's brother is as innocent as I be. He hath had nought to do with\nany wicked doings here. He hath not got his money, but he means to have\nit.\"\n\n\"Thank God!\" cried Lady Waldron, but whether about the money, or the\ninnocence, was not clear; and then she turned away, to have things out\nwith herself; and Jakes was sent into the next room, and sat down,\nthanking the crown of his hat that it covered the whole of his domestic\ninterests.\n\nWhen feminine excitement was in some degree spent, and the love of\nparticulars (which can never long be quenched by any depth of tears),\nwas reviving, Sergeant Jakes was well received, and told his adventures\nlike a veteran. A young man is apt to tell things hotly, as if nothing\nhad ever come to pass before; but a steady-goer knows that the sun was\nshining, and the rain was raining, and the wind was blowing, ere he felt\nany one of them. Alike the whole must be cut short.\n\nIt appears that the Sergeant had a fine voyage out, and picked up a\ngood deal of his lapsed Spanish lore, from two worthy Spanish hands\namong the crew. Besley of Exeter did things well--as the manner of that\ncity is--victuals were good, and the crew right loyal, as generally\nhappens in that case. Captain Binstock stood in awe of his elder\nbrother, the butler, and never got out of his head its original belief\nthat the Sergeant was his brother's schoolmaster. Against that idea\nchronology strove hazily, and therefore vainly. The Sergeant strode the\ndeck with a stick he bought at Exeter, spoke of his experience in\ntransports, regarded the masts as a pair of his own canes--in a word was\nmaster of the ship, whenever there was nothing to be done to her. A\nfiner time he never had, for he was much too wiry to be sea-sick. All\nthe crew liked him, whether present or absent, and never laughed at him\nbut in the latter case. He corrected their English, when it did not suit\nhis own, and thus created a new form of discipline. Most of this he\nrecounted in his pungent manner, without a word of self-laudation; and\nit would have been a treat to Christie Fox to hear him; but his present\nlisteners were too anxious about the result to enjoy this part of it.\n\nThen he went to the city to which he was despatched, and presented his\nletters to the few he could find entitled to receive them. The greater\npart were gone beyond the world of letters, for twenty-five years make a\nsad gap in the post. And of the three survivors, one alone cared to be\ntroubled with the bygone days. But that one was a host in himself, a\nloyal retainer of the ancient family, in the time of its grandeur, and\nnow in possession of a sinecure post, as well as a nice farm on the\nhills, both of which he had obtained through their influence. He was\ndelighted to hear once more of the beautiful lady he had formerly\nadored. He received the Sergeant as his guest, and told him all that was\nknown of the present state of things, concerning the young Count--as he\nstill called him--and all that was likely to come of it.\n\nIt was true that the Count had urged his claim, and brought evidence in\nsupport of it; but at present there seemed to be very little chance of\nhis getting the money for years to come, even if he should do so in the\nend; and for that he must display, as they said, fresh powers of\nsurvivorship. He had been advised to make an offer of release and\nquit-claim, upon receipt of the sum originally advanced without any\ninterest; but he had answered sternly, \"either I will have all, or\nnone.\"\n\nThe amount was so large, that he could not expect to receive the whole\nimmediately; and he was ready to accept it by instalments; but the\nauthorities would not pay a penny, nor attempt an arrangement with him,\nfor fear of admitting their liability. In a very brief, and candid, but\nby no means honest manner, they refused to be bound at all by the action\nof their fathers. When that was of no avail, because the City-tolls were\nin the bond, they began to call for proof of this, and evidence of that,\nand set up every possible legal obstacle, hoping to exhaust the\nclaimant's sadly dwindled revenues. Above all, they maintained that two\nof the lives in the assurance-deed were still subsisting, although their\nlapse was admitted in their own minutes, and registered in the record.\nAnd it was believed that in this behalf, they were having recourse to\npersonation.\n\nThat scandalous pretext must be demolished, before it could become of\nprime moment to the Count to prove the decease of his brother-in-law;\nand certain it was that no such dramatic incident had occurred in the\nCity, as that which her ladyship had witnessed, by means of her\nimagination. With a long fight before him, and very scanty sinews of war\nto maintain it, the claimant had betaken himself to Madrid, where he had\npowerful friends, and might consult the best legal advisers. But his\nprospects were not encouraging; for unless he could deposit a good round\nsum, for expenses of process, and long enquiry, and even counterbribing,\nno one was likely to take up his case, so strong and so tough were the\nforces in possession. Rash friends went so far as to recommend him to\ntake the bull by the horns at once, to lay forcible hands upon the\nCity-tolls, without any order from a law-court, for the Deed was so\ndrastic that this power was conferred; but he saw that to do this would\nsimply be to play into the hands of the enemy. For thus he would\nprobably find himself outlawed, or perhaps cast into prison, with the\nlapse of his own life imminent; for the family of the Barcas were no\nlonger supreme in the land, as they used to be.\n\n\"Ungrateful thieves! Vile pigs of burghers!\" Lady Waldron exclaimed with\njust indignation. \"My grandfather would have strung them up with straw\nin their noses, and set them on fire. They sneer at the family of Barca,\ndo they? It shall trample them underfoot. My poor brother shall have my\nlast penny to punish them; for that I have wronged him in my heart. Ours\nis a noble race, and most candid. We never deign to stoop ourselves to\nmistrust or suspicion: I trust Master Sergeant, you have not spoken so\nto the worthy and loyal Diego, that my brother may ever hear of the\nthoughts introduced into my mind concerning him?\"\n\n\"No, my lady, not a word. Everything I did, or said, was friendly,\nstraight-forward, and favourable to the honour of the family.\"\n\n\"You are a brave man; you are a faithful soldier. Forget that by the\nforce of circumstances I was compelled to have such opinions. But can\nyou recite to me the names of the two persons, whose lives they have\nreplenished?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lady. Se\u00c3\u00b1or Diego wrote them down in this book on purpose. He\nthought that your ladyship might know something of them.\"\n\n\"For one I have knowledge of everything; but the other I do not know,\"\nLady Waldron said, after reading the names. \"This poor Se\u00c3\u00b1orita was one\nof my bridesmaids, known to me from my childhood. _La Giralda_ was her\nname of intimacy, what you call her nickname, by reason of her stature.\nHer death I can prove too well, and expose any imitation. But the\nSpanish nation--you like them much? You find them gentle, brave,\namiable, sober, not as the English are, generous, patriotic,\nhonourable?\"\n\n\"Quite as noble and good, my lady, as we found them five and twenty\nyears agone. And I hope that the noble Count will get his money. A\nbargain is a bargain--as we say here. And if they are so honourable----\"\n\n\"Ah, that is quite a different thing. Inez, I must leave you. I desire\nsome time to think. My mind is very much relieved of one part, although\nof another still more distressed. I request you to see to the good\nrefreshment of this honourable and faithful soldier.\"\n\nLady Waldron acknowledged the Sergeant's low bow, with a kind\ninclination of her Andalusian head (which is something in the headway\namong the foremost) and left the room with a lighter step than her heart\nhad allowed her for many a week.\n\n\"This will never do, Sergeant; this won't do at all,\" said Miss Waldron\ncoming up to him, as soon as she had shut the door behind her lofty\nmother. \"I know by your countenance, and the way you were standing, and\nthe side-way you sit down again, that you have not told us everything.\nThat is not the right way to go on, Sergeant Jakes.\"\n\n\"Miss Nicie!\" cried Jakes, with a forlorn hope of frightening her, for\nshe had sat upon his knee, many a time, ten or twelve years ago, craving\nstories of good boys and bad boys. But now the eyes, which he used to\nfill with any emotion he chose to call for, could produce that effect\nupon his own.\n\n\"Can you think that I don't understand you?\" said Nicie, never releasing\nhim from her eyes. \"What was the good of telling me all those stories,\nwhen I was a little thing, except for me to understand you? When anybody\ntells me a story that is true, it is no good for him to try anything\nelse. I get so accustomed to his way, that I catch him out in a moment.\"\n\n\"But my dear, my dear Miss Nicie,\" the Sergeant looked all about, as in\nlarge appeal, instead of fixing steady gaze; \"if I have told you a\nsingle word that is not as true as Gospel--may I----\"\n\n\"Now don't be profane, Sergeant Jakes. That was allowed perhaps in\nwar-time. And don't be crooked--which is even worse. I never called in\nquestion any one thing you have said. All I know is that you have\nstopped short. You used to do just the same with me, when things I was\ntoo young to hear came in. You are easier to read than one of your own\ncopies. What have you kept in the background, you unfaithful soldier?\"\n\n\"Oh Miss, how you do remind me of the Colonel! Not that he ever looked\nhalf as fierce. But he used to say, 'Jakes what a deep rogue you are!'\nmeaning how deeply he could trust me, against all his enemies. But Miss,\nI have given my word about this.\"\n\n\"Then take it back, as some people do their presents. What is the good\nof being a deep rogue, if you can't be a shallow one? I should hope you\nwould rather be a rogue, to other people than to me. I will never speak\nto you again, unless you show now that you can trust me, as my dear\nfather used to trust in you. No secrets from me, if you please.\"\n\n\"Well, Miss, it was for your sake, more than anybody else's. But you\nmust promise, honour bright, not to let her ladyship know of it; for it\nmight be the death of her. It took me by surprise, and it hath almost\nknocked me over; for I never could have thought there was more troubles\ncoming. But who do you think I ran up against, to Exeter?\"\n\n\"How can I tell? Don't keep me waiting. That kind of riddle is so\nhateful always.\"\n\n\"Master Tom, Miss Nicie! Your brother, Master Tom! 'Sir Thomas Waldron'\nhis proper name is now. You know they have got a new oil they call\n_gas_, to light the public places of the big towns with, and it makes\neverything as bright as day, and brighter than some of the days we get\nnow. Well, I was intending to come on last night by the Bristol mail,\nand wait about till you was up; and as I was standing with my knapsack\non my shoulder, to see her come in from Plymouth, in she comes, and a\ntall young man dressed all in black, gets down slowly from the roof, and\nstands looking about very queerly.\n\n\"'Bain't you going no further, Sir?' says the Guard to him very civil,\nas he locked the bags in; 'only allows us three minutes and a\nhalf,'--for the young man seemed as if he did not care what time it was.\n\n\"'No. I can't go home;' says he, as if nothing mattered to him. I was\nhanding up my things, to get up myself, when the tone of his voice took\nme all of a heap.\n\n\"'What, Master Tom!' says I, going up to him.\n\n\"'Who are you?' says he. 'Master Tom, indeed!' For I had this queer sort\nof hat on, and cloak, like a blessed foreigner.\n\n\"Well, when I told him who I was, he did not seem at all as he used to\nbe, but as if I had done him a great injury; and as for his luggage, it\nwould have gone on with the coach, if the Guard had not called out about\nit.\n\n\"'Come in here;' he says to me, as if I was a dog, him that was always\nso well-spoken and polite! And he turned sharp into _The Old London\nInn_, leaving all his luggage on the stones outside.\n\n\"'Private sitting-room, and four candles!' he called out, marching up\nthe stairs, and making me a sign to follow him. Everybody seemed to know\nhim there, and I told them to fetch his things in.\n\n\"'No fire! Hot enough already. Put the candles down, and go;' said he to\nthe waiter, and then he locked the door, and threw the key upon the\ntable. It takes a good deal to frighten me, Miss. But I assure you I was\ntrembling; for I never saw such a pair of eyes--not furious, but so\ndesperate; and I should have been but a baby in his hands, for he is\nbigger than even his father was. Then he pulled out a newspaper, and\nspread it among the candles.\n\n\"'Now, you man of Perlycross,' he cried, 'you that teach the boys, who\nare going to be grave-robbers,--is this true, or is it all a cursed\nlie?' Excuse me telling you, Miss, exactly as he said it. 'The Lord in\nheaven help me, I think I shall go mad, unless you can tell me it is all\na wicked lie.' Up and down the room he walked, as if the boards would\nsink under him; while I was at my wits' ends, as you may well suppose,\nMiss.\n\n\"'I have never heard a word of any of this, Master Tom;' I said, as soon\nas I had read it; for it was all about something that came on at\nPerliton before the Magistrates, last Wednesday. 'I have been away in\nforeign parts.'\n\n\"Miss Nicie, he changed to me from that moment. I had not said a word\nabout how long I was away, or anything whatever to deceive him. But he\nlooked at my hat that was lying on a chair, and my cloak that was still\non my back, as much as to say--'I ought to have known it;' and then he\nsaid, 'Give me your hand, Old Jakes. I beg your pardon a thousand times.\nWhat a fool I must be, to think you would ever have allowed it!'\n\n\"This put me in a very awkward hole; for I was bound to acknowledge\nthat I had been here, when the thing, he was so wild about, was done.\nBut I let him go on, and have his raving out. For men are pretty much\nthe same as boys; though expecting of their own way more, which I try to\ntake out of the young ones. But a loud singing out, and a little bit of\nstamping, brings them into more sense of what they be.\n\n\"'I landed at Plymouth this morning,' he said, 'after getting a letter,\nwhich had been I don't know where, to tell me that my dear father, the\nbest man that ever lived, was dead. I got leave immediately, and came\nhome to comfort my mother and sister, and to attend to all that was\nneedful. I went into the coffee-room, before the coach was ready; and\ntaking up the papers, I find this! They talk of it, as if it was a thing\nwell known, a case of great interest in the county; a _mystery_ they\ncall it, a very lively thing to talk about--_The great Perlycross\nMystery_, in big letters, cried at every corner, made a fine joke of in\nevery dirty pot-house. It seems to have been going on for months.\nPerhaps it has killed my mother and my sister. It would soon kill me, if\nI were there, and could do nothing.'\n\n\"Here I found a sort of opening; for the tears rolled down his face, as\nhe thought of you, Miss Nicie, and your dear Mamma; and the rage in his\nheart seemed to turn into grief, and he sat down in one of the trumpery\nchairs that they make nowadays, and it sprawled and squeaked under him,\nbeing such an uncommon fine young man in trouble. So I went up to him,\nand stood before him, and lifted his hands from his face, as I had done\nmany's the time, when he was a little fellow, and broke his nose perhaps\nin his bravery. And then he looked up at me quite mild, and said--\n\n\"'I believe I am a brute, Jakes. But isn't this enough to make me one?'\n\n\"I stayed with him all night, Miss; for he would not go to bed, and he\nwouldn't have nothing for to eat or drink; and I was afraid to leave him\nso. But I got him at last to smoke a bit of my tobacco; and that seemed\nto make him look at things a little better. I told him all I knew, and\nwhat I had been to Spain for, and how you and her ladyship were trying\nbravely to bear the terrible will of the Lord; and then I coaxed him all\nI could, to come along of me, and help you to bear it. But he said--'I\nmight take him for a coward, if I chose; but come to Walderscourt he\nwouldn't, and face his own mother and sister he couldn't; until he had\ncleared off this terrible disgrace.'\"\n\n\"He is frightfully obstinate, he always was;\" said Nicie, who had\nlistened to this tale, with streaming eyes; \"but it would be such a\ncomfort to us both, to have him here. What has become of him? Where is\nhe now?\"\n\n\"That is the very thing I dare not tell you, Miss; because he made me\nswear to keep it to myself. By good rights, I ought to have told you\nnothing; but you managed so to work it out of me. I would not come away\nfrom him, till I knew where he would be, because he was in such a state\nof mind. But I softened him down a good bit, I believe; and he might\ntake a turn, if you were to write, imploring of him. I will take care\nthat he gets it, for he made me promise to write, and let him know\nexactly how I found things here, after being away so long. But he is\nthat bitter against this place, that it will take a deal to bring him\nhere. You must work on his love for his mother, Miss Nicie, and his pity\nfor the both of you. That is the only thing that touches him. And say\nthat it is no fault of Perlycross, but strangers altogether.\"\n\n\"You shall have my letter before the postman comes, so that you may send\nit with your own. What a good friend you have been to us, dear Jakes! My\nmother's heart would break at last, if she knew that Tom was in England,\nand would not come first of all to her. I can scarcely understand it. To\nme it seems so unnatural.\"\n\n\"Well, Miss, you never can tell by yourself, how other people will take\nthings--not even your own brother. And I think he will soon come round,\nMiss Nicie. According to my opinion, it was the first shock of the\nthing, and the way he got it, that drove him out of his mind a'most.\nMaybe, he judges you by himself, and fancies it would only make you\nworse, to see him, with this disgrace upon him. For that's what he can't\nget out of his head; and it would be a terrible meeting for my lady,\nwith all the pride she hath in him. I reckon 'tis the Spanish blood that\ndoes it; Englishman as he is, all over. But never fear, Miss Nicie;\nwe'll fetch him here, between the two of us, afore we are much older. He\nhath always been loving in his nature; and love will drive the anger\nout.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI.\n\nTHE PRIDE OF LIFE.\n\n\nHarvey Tremlett kept his promise not to leave the neighbourhood, until\nthe result of the grievous injury done to Frank Gilham should be known.\nAnother warrant against him might be issued for that fierce assault, and\nhe had made up his mind to stand a trial, whatever result might come of\nit. What he feared most, and would have fled from, was a charge of\nrunning contraband goods, which might have destroyed a thriving trade,\nand sent him and his colleagues across the seas. Rough and savage as he\nbecame, (when his violent temper was provoked) and scornful of home-life\nand quiet labour--these and other far from exemplary traits, were mainly\nthe result of his roving habits, and the coarse and lawless company into\nwhich he had ever fallen. And it tended little to his edification, that\nhe exercised lordship over them, in virtue of superior strength.\n\nBut his nature was rather wild than brutal; in its depths were sparks\nand flashes of manly generosity, and even warmth of true affection for\nthe few who had been kind to him, if they took him the right way of his\nstubborn grain. He loved his only daughter Zip, although ashamed of\nshowing it; and he was very proud of his lineage, and the ancient name\nof Tremlett. Thus Mr. Penniloe had taken unawares the straightest road\nto his good will, by adopting the waif as an inmate of his house, and\ntreating her, not as a servant, but a child. That Zip should be a lady,\nas the daughters of that Norman race had been for generations, was the\nmain ambition of her father's life. He had seen no possibility of it;\nand here was almost a surety of it, unless she herself threw away the\nchance.\n\nRather a pretty scene was toward for those who are fond of humanity, at\nthe ruined Tremlett mill, on the morning of Saint David's day. Harvey\nhad taken to this retreat--and a very lonely home it was--for sundry\ngood reasons of his own; the most important of which was not entrusted\neven to his daughter, or the revered and beloved Parson. This was to\nprepare a refuge, and a store house for Free-trade, more convenient,\nbetter placed, larger, and much safer than the now notorious fastness of\nBlackmarsh. Here were old buildings, and mazy webs of wandering; soft\ncliff was handy, dark wood and rushing waters, tangled lanes, furzy\ncorners, nooks of overhanging, depths of in-and-out hood-winks of\nnature, when she does not wish man to know everything about her. The\nsolid firm, directed by Timber-leg'd Dick, were prepared to pay a fine\nprice, as for a paper mill, for this last feudal tenure of the Tremlett\nrace.\n\nBut the last male member of that much discounted stock (or at any rate\nthe last now producible in Court, without criminal procedure) had\nrefused to consider the most liberal offers, even of a fine run of\nFree-trade, all to himself--as still it is--for the alienation in\nfee-simple of this last sod of hereditament. For good consideration, he\nwould grant a lease, which Blickson might prepare for them; but he would\nbe--something the nadir of benediction--if he didn't knock down any man,\nwho would try to make him rob his daughter. The league of Free-traders\ncame into his fine feelings, and took the mills and premises, on a good\nelastic lease. But the landlord must put them into suitable condition.\n\nThis he was doing now, with technical experience, endeavouring at the\nsame time to discharge some little of his new parental duties. Jem\nKettel found it very hard, that though allowed to work, he was not\nencouraged (as he used to be) to participate in the higher moments. \"You\nclear out, when my darter cometh. You be no fit company for she.\" Jem\ncould not see it, for he knew how good he was.\n\nBut the big man had taken a much larger turn. He was not going to alter\nhis own course of life. That was quite good enough for him; and really\nin those days people heard so much of \"Reform! Reform!\" dinged for ever\nin their ears, that any one at all inclined to think for himself had a\ntendency towards backsliding. None the less, must he urge others to\nreform; as the manner has been of all ages.\n\nTremlett's present anxiety was to provide his daughter with good\nadvice, and principles so exalted, that there might be no further peril\nof her becoming like himself. From him she was to learn the value of\nproper pride and dignity, of behaving in her new position, as if she had\nbeen born to it, of remembering distant forefathers, but forgetting her\npresent father, at any rate as an example. To this end he made her study\nthe great ancestral Bible--not the Canonical books however, so much as\nthe covers and fly-leaves--the wholly uninspired records of the Tremlett\nfamily. These she perused with eager eyes, thinking more highly of\nherself, and laying in large store of pride--a bitter stock to start\nwith--even when the course of youth is fair.\n\nBut whether for evil or for good, it was pleasant to see the rough man\nsitting, this first day of the Spring-time, teaching his little daughter\nhow sadly he and she had come down in the world. Zip had been spared\nfrom her regular lessons, by way of a treat, to dine with her father,\nbefore going--as was now arranged--to the care of a lady at Exeter. Jem\nKettel had been obliged to dine upon inferior victuals, and at the less\nfashionable hour of eleven a.m.; for it was not to be known that he was\nthere, lest attention should be drawn to the job they were about.\nTremlett had washed himself very finely, in honour of this great\noccasion, and donned a new red woollen jacket, following every curve and\nchunk of his bulky chest and rugged arms. He had finished his dinner,\nand was in good spirits, with money enough from his wrestling prize to\nlast him until the next good run, and a pipe of choice tobacco (such as\ncould scarcely be got at Exeter), issuing soft rings of turquoise tint\nto the black oak beams above. The mill-wheel was gone; but the murmur of\nthe brook, and the tinkle of the trickle from the shattered trough, and\nthe singing of birds in their love-time came, like the waving of a\nbranch that sends the sunshine in.\n\nThe dark-haired child was in the window-seat, with her Sunday frock on,\nand her tresses ribboned back, and her knees wide apart to make a lap\nfor the Bible, upon which her great brown eyes were fixed. Puffs of the\nMarch wind now and then came in, where the lozenges of glass were gone,\nand lifted loose tussocks of her untrussed hair, and set the sunshine\ndancing on the worn planks of the floor. But the girl was used to\nbreezes, and her heart was in her lesson.\n\n\"Hunderds of 'em, more than all the Kings and Queens of England!\" she\nsaid, with her very clear voice trembling, and her pointed fingers\nmaking hop-scotch in and out the lines of genealogy. \"What can Fay\nPenniloe show like that? But was any of 'em Colonels, father?\"\n\n\"Maight a'been, if 'em would a' comed down to it. But there wasn't no\nColonels, in the old times, I've a' heered. Us was afore that sort of\nthing were found out.\"\n\n\"To be sure. I might have knowed. But was any of 'em, Sirs, the same as\nSir Thomas Waldron was?\"\n\n\"Scores of 'em, when they chose to come down to it. But they kept that,\nmost ways, for the younger boys among 'em. The father of the family was\nbound to be a Lord.\"\n\n\"Oh father! Real lords? And me to have never seed one! What hath become\nof the laws of the land? But why bain't you a real lord, the same as\nthey was?\"\n\n\"Us never cared to keep it up;\" said the last of the visible Tremletts,\nafter pondering over this difficult point. \"You see, Zip, it's only the\nwomen cares for that. 'Tis no more to a man, than the puff of this here\npipe.\"\n\n\"But right is right, father. And it soundeth fine. Was any of them\nEarls, and Marquises, and Dukes, and whatever it is that comes over\nthat?\"\n\n\"They was everything they cared to be. Barons, and Counts, and Dukes,\nspelled the same as Ducks, and Holy Empires, and Holy Sepulkers. But\ndo'e, my dear, get my baccy box.\"\n\nWhat summit of sovereignty they would have reached, if the lecture had\nproceeded, no one knows; for as Zip, like a Princess, was stepping in\nand out among the holes of the floor, with her father's tin box, the old\ndoor shook with a sharp and heavy knock; and the child with her face lit\nup by the glory of her birth, marched away to open it. This she\naccomplished with some trouble, for the timber was ponderous and\nrickety.\n\nA tall young man strode in, as if the place belonged to him, and said,\n\"I want to see Harvey Tremlett.\"\n\n\"Here be I. Who be you?\"\n\nThe wrestler sat where he was, and did not even nod his head; for his\nrule was always to take people, just as they chose to take him. But the\nvisitor cared little for his politeness, or his rudeness.\n\n\"I am Sir Thomas Waldron's son. If I came in upon you rudely, I am sorry\nfor it. It is not what I often do. But just now I am not a bit like\nmyself.\"\n\n\"Sir, I could take my oath of that; for your father was a gen'leman.\nZippy, dust a cheer, my dear.\"\n\n\"No, young lady, you shall not touch it,\" said the young man, with a\nlong stride, and a gentle bow to the comely child. \"I am fitter to lift\nchairs than you are.\"\n\nThis pleased the father mightily; and he became quite gracious, when the\nyoung Sir Thomas said to him, while glancing with manifest surprise at\nhis quick and intelligent daughter--\n\n\"Mr. Tremlett, I wish to speak to you, of a matter too sad to be talked\nabout, in the presence of young ladies.\"\n\nThis was not said by way of flattery or conciliation; for Zip, with her\nproud step and steadfast gaze, was of a very different type from that of\nthe common cottage lass. She was already at the door, when her father\nsaid--\n\n\"Go you down to the brook, my dear, and see how many nestesses you can\nfind. Then come back and say good-bye to Daddy, afore go home to\nPassonage. Must be back afore dark, you know.\"\n\n\"What a beautiful child!\" Young Waldron had been looking with amazement\nat her. \"I know what the Tremletts used to be; but I had no idea they\ncould be like that. I never saw such eyes in all my life.\"\n\n\"Her be well enough,\" replied the father shortly. \"And now, sir, what is\nit as I can do for you? I knows zummat of the troubles on your mind; and\nif I can do'e any good, I wull.\"\n\n\"Two things I want of you. First, your word of honour--and I know what\nyou Tremletts have been in better days--that you had nothing to do with\nthat cursed and devilish crime in our churchyard.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" answered Tremlett, standing up for the first time in this\ninterview, \"I give you my oath by that book yon'ner that I knows nort\nabout it. We be coom low; but us bain't zunk to that yet.\"\n\nHe met Sir Thomas Waldron, eye to eye, and the young man took his\nplastered hand, and knew that it was not a liar's.\n\n\"Next I want your good advice,\" said the visitor, sitting down by him;\n\"and your help, if you will give it. I will not speak of money because I\ncan see what you are. But first to follow it up, there must be money.\nShall I tell you what I shall be glad to do, without risk of offending\nyou? Very well; I don't care a fig for money, in a matter such as this.\nMoney won't give you back your father, or your mother, or anybody, when\nthey are gone away from you. But it may help you to do your duty to\nthem. At present, I have no money to speak of; because I have been with\nmy regiment, and there it goes away, like smoke. But I can get any\nquantity almost, by going to our lawyers. If you like, and will see to\nit, I will put a thousand pounds in your hands, for you to be able to\nwork things up; and another thousand, if you make anything of it. Don't\nbe angry with me. I don't want to bribe you. It is only for the sake of\ndoing right. I have seen a great deal of the world. Can you ever get\nwhat is right, without paying for it?\"\n\n\"No, sir, you can't. And not always, if you do. But you be the right\nsort, and no mistake. Tell you what, Sir Thomas--I won't take a farden\nof your money, 'cos it would be a'robbin' of you. I han't got the brains\nfor gooin' under other folk, like. Generally they does that to me. But I\nknow an oncommon sharp young fellow, Jemmy Kettel is his name. A chap as\ncan goo and come fifty taimes, a'most, while I be a toornin' round\nwance; a'knoweth a'most every rogue for fifty maile around. And if you\nlike to goo so far as a ten-pun' note upon him, I'll zee that a'doth his\nbest wi'un. But never a farden over what I said.\"\n\n\"I am very much obliged to you. Here it is; and another next week, if he\nrequires it. I hate the sight of money, while this thing lasts; because\nI know that money is at the bottom of it. Tremlett, you are a noble\nfellow. Your opinion is worth something. Now don't you agree with me in\nthinking, that after all it comes to this--everything else has been\nproved rubbish--the doctors are at the bottom of it?\"\n\n\"Well, sir, I am afeared they be. I never knowed nort of 'em, thank the\nLord. But I did hear they was oncommon greedy to cut up a poor brother\nof mine, as coom to trouble. I was out o' country then; or by Gosh, I\nwud a' found them a job or two to do at home.\"\n\nThe young man closed his lips, and thought. Tremlett's opinion, although\nof little value, was all that was needed to clench his own. \"I'll go and\nput a stop to it at once;\" he muttered; and after a few more words with\nthe wrestler, he set his long legs going rapidly, and his forehead\nfrowning, in the direction of that \u00c3\u0086sculapian fortress, known as the\n_Old Barn_.\n\nBy this time Dr. Fox was in good health again, recovering his sprightly\ntone of mind, and magnanimous self-confidence. His gratitude to Frank\nGilham now was as keen and strong as could be wished; for the patient's\ncalmness, and fortitude, and very fine constitution had secured his warm\naffection, by affording him such a field for skill, and such a signal\ntriumph, as seldom yet have rejoiced a heart at once medical and\nsurgical. Whenever Dr. Gronow came, and dwelling on the ingenious\nstructure designed and wrought by Jemmy's skill, poured forth kind\napproval and the precious applause of an expert, the youthful doctor's\ndelight was like a young mother's pride in her baby. And it surged\nwithin him all the more, because he could not--as the mother\ndoes--inundate all the world with it. Wiser too than that sweet parent,\nhe had refused most stubbornly to risk the duration of his joy, or\nimperil the precious subject, by any ardour of excitement or flutter of\nthe system.\n\nThe patient lay, like a well-set specimen in the box of a naturalist,\ncarded, and trussed, and pinned, and fibred, bound to maintain one\nimmutable plane. His mother hovered round him with perpetual presence;\nas a house-martin flits round her fallen nestling, circling about that\none pivot of the world, back for a twittering moment, again sweeping the\nair for a sip of him.\n\nBut the one he would have given all the world to have a sip of, even in\na dream he must not see. Such was the stern decree of the power, even\nmore ruthless than that to which it punctually despatches\nus--\u00c3\u0086sculapius, less mansuete to human tears than \u00c3\u0086acus. To put it more\nplainly, and therefore better,--Master Frank did not even know that\nMiss Christie was on the premises.\n\nChristie was sitting by the window, thrown out where the barn-door used\nto be,--where the cart was backed up with the tithe-sheaves golden, but\nnow the gilded pills were rolled, and the only wholesome bit of metal\nwas the sunshine on her hair--when she saw a large figure come in at the\ngate (which was still of the fine agricultural sort) and a shudder ran\ndown her shapely back. With feminine speed of apprehension, she felt\nthat it could be one man only, the man she had heard so much of, a\nmonster of size and ferocity, the man who had \"concussed\" her brother's\nhead, and shattered an arm of great interest to her. That she ran to the\ndoor, which was wide to let the Spring in, and clapped it to the post,\nspeaks volumes for her courage.\n\n\"You can't come in here, Harvey Tremlett,\" she cried, with a little foot\nset, as a forlorn hope, against the bottom of the door, which (after the\nmanner of its kind) refused to go home, when called upon; \"you have done\nharm enough, and I am astonished that you should dare to imagine we\nwould let you in.\"\n\n\"But I am not Harvey Tremlett, at all. I am only Tom Waldron. And I\ndon't see why I should be shut out when I have done no harm.\"\n\nThe young lady was not to be caught with chaff. She took a little peep\nthrough the chink, having learned that art in a very sweet manner of\nlate; and then she threw open the door, and showed herself, a fine\nfigure of blushes.\n\n\"Miss Fox, I am sure,\" said the visitor, smiling and lifting his hat as\nhe had learned to do abroad. \"But I won't come in, against orders,\nwhatever the temptation may be.\"\n\n\"We don't know any harm of you, and you may come in;\" answered Chris,\nwho was never long taken aback. \"Your sister is a dear friend of mine. I\nam sorry for being so rude to you.\"\n\nWaldron sat down, and was cheerful for awhile, greatly pleased with his\nyoung entertainer, and her simple account of the state of things there.\nBut when she enquired for his mother and sister, the cloud returned, and\nhe meant business.\n\n\"You are likely to know more than I do,\" he said, \"for I have not been\nhome, and cannot go there yet. I will not trouble you with dark\nthings--but may I have a little talk with your brother?\"\n\nMiss Fox left the room at once, and sent her brother down; and now a\nvery strange surprise befell the sprightly doctor. Sir Thomas Waldron\nmet him with much cordiality and warmth, for they had always been good\nfriends, though their natures were so different; and then he delivered\nthis fatal shot.\n\n\"I am very sorry, my dear Jemmy, but I have had to make up my mind to do\na thing you won't much like. I know you have always thought a great deal\nof my sister, Inez; and now I am told, though I have not seen her, that\nyou are as good as engaged to her. But you must perceive that it would\nnever do. I could not wish for a better sort of fellow, and I have the\nhighest opinion of you. Really I think that you would have made her as\nhappy as the day is long, because you are so clever, and cheerful, and\ngood-tempered, and--and in fact I may say, good all round. But you must\nboth of you get over it. I am now the head of the family; and I don't\nlike saying it, but I must. I cannot allow you to have Nicie; and I\nshall forbid Nicie to think any more of you.\"\n\n\"What, the deuce, do you mean, Tom?\" asked Jemmy, scarcely believing his\nears. \"What's up now, in the name of goodness? What on earth have you\ngot into your precious noddle?\"\n\n\"Jemmy, my noddle--as you call it--may not be a quarter so clever as\nyours; and in fact I know it is not over-bright, without having the\nbenefit of your opinion. But for all that, it has some common sense; and\nit knows its own mind pretty well; and what it says, it sticks to. You\nare bound to take it in a friendly manner, because that is how I intend\nit; and you must see the good sense of it. I shall be happy and proud\nmyself to continue our friendship. Only you must pledge your word, that\nyou will have nothing more to say to my sister, Inez.\"\n\n\"But why, Tom, why?\" Fox asked again, with increasing wonder. He was\nhalf inclined to laugh at the other's solemn and official style, but he\nsaw that it would be a dangerous thing, for Waldron's colour was\nrising. \"What objection have you discovered, or somebody else found out\nfor you? Surely you are dreaming, Tom!\"\n\n\"No, I am not. And I shall not let you. I should almost have thought\nthat you might have known, without my having to tell you. If you think\ntwice, you will see at once, that reason, and common sense, and justice,\nand knowledge of the world, and the feeling of a gentleman--all compel\nyou to--to knock off, if I may so express it. I can only say that if you\ncan't see it, everybody else can, at a glance.\"\n\n\"No doubt I am the thickest of the thick--though it may not be the\ngeneral opinion. But do give me ever such a little hint, Tom; something\nof a twinkle in this frightful fog.\"\n\n\"Well, you are a doctor, aren't you now?\"\n\n\"Certainly I am, and proud of it. Only wish I was a better one.\"\n\n\"Very well. The doctors have dug up my father. And no doctor ever shall\nmarry his daughter.\"\n\nThe absurdity of this was of a very common kind, as the fallacy is of\nthe commonest; and there was nothing very rare to laugh at. But Fox did\nthe worst thing he could have done--he laughed till his sides were\naching. Too late he perceived that he had been as scant of discretion,\nas the other was of logic.\n\n\"That's how you take it, is it, Sir?\" young Waldron cried, ready to\nknock him down, if he could have done so without cowardice. \"A lucky\nthing for you, that you are on the sick-list; or I'd soon make you laugh\nthe other side of your mouth, you guffawing jackanapes. If you can laugh\nat what was done to my father, it proves that you are capable of doing\nit. When you have done with your idiot grin, I'll just ask you one\nthing--never let me set eyes on your sniggering, grinning, pill-box of a\nface again.\"\n\n\"That you may be quite sure you never shall do,\" answered Fox, who was\nashy pale with anger; \"until you have begged my pardon humbly, and owned\nyourself a thick-headed, hot-headed fool. I am sorry that your father\nshould have such a ninny of a cad to come after him. Everybody\nacknowledges that the late Sir Thomas was a gentleman.\"\n\nThe present Sir Thomas would not trust himself near such a fellow for\nanother moment, but flung out of the house without his hat; while Fox\nproved that he was no coward, by following, and throwing it after him.\nAnd the other young man proved the like of himself, by not turning round\nand smashing him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII.\n\nHIS LAST BIVOUAC.\n\n\n\"Have I done wrong?\" Young Waldron asked himself, as he strode down the\nhill, with his face still burning, and that muddy hat on. \"Most fellows\nwould have knocked him down. I hope that nice girl heard nothing of the\nrow. The walls are jolly thick, that's one good thing; as thick as my\npoor head, I dare say. But when the fellow dared to laugh! Good Heavens,\nis our family reduced to that? I dare say I am a hot-headed fool, though\nI kept my temper wonderfully; and to tell me I am not a gentleman! Well,\nI don't care a rap who sees me now, for they must hear of this affair at\nWalderscourt. I think the best thing that I can do is to go and see old\nPenniloe. He is as honest as he is clear-headed. If he says I'm wrong,\nI'll believe it. And I'll take his advice about other things.\"\n\nThis was the wisest resolution of his life, inasmuch as it proved to be\nthe happiest. Mr. Penniloe had just finished afternoon work with his\npupils, and they were setting off; Pike with his rod to the long pool up\nthe meadows, which always fished best with a cockle up it, Peckover for\na long steeple-chase, and Mopuss to look for chalcedonies, and mosses,\namong the cleves of Hagdon Hill; for nature had nudged him into that\nhigh bliss, which a child has in routing out his father's pockets. The\nParson, who felt a warm regard for a very fine specimen of hot youth,\nwho was at once the son of his oldest friend, and his own son in\nliterature--though Minerva sat cross-legged at that travail--he, Mr.\nPenniloe, was in a gentle mood, as he seldom failed to be; moreover in\na fine mood, as behoves a man who has been dealing with great authors,\nand walking as in a crystal world, so different from our turbid fog.\n\nTo him the young man poured forth his troubles, deeper than of certain\nClassic woes, too substantial to be laid by any triple cast of dust. And\nthen he confessed his flagrant insult to a rising member of the great\nProfession.\n\n\"You have behaved very badly, according to your own account;\" Mr.\nPenniloe said with much decision, knowing that his own weakness was to\nlet people off too easily, and feeling that duty to his ancient friend\ncompelled him to chastise his son; \"but your bad behaviour to Jemmy Fox\nhas some excuse in quick temper provoked. Your conduct towards your\nmother and sister is ten times worse; because it is mean.\"\n\n\"I don't see how you can make that out.\" Young Waldron would have flown\ninto a fury with any other man who had said this. Even as it was, he\nstood up with a doubtful countenance, glancing at the door.\n\n\"It is mean, in this way,\" continued the Parson, leaving him to go, if\nhe thought fit, \"that you have thought more of yourself than them.\nBecause it would have hurt your pride to go to them, with this wrong\nstill unredressed, you have chosen to forget the comfort your presence\nmust have afforded them, and the bitter pain they must feel at hearing\nthat you have returned and avoided them. In a like case, your father\nwould not have acted so.\"\n\nWaldron sat down again, and his great frame trembled. He covered his\nface with his hands, and tears shone upon his warted knuckles; for he\nhad not yet lost all those exuberances of youth.\n\n\"I never thought of that,\" he muttered; \"it never struck me in that way.\nThough Jakes said something like it. But he could not put it, as you do.\nI see that I have been a cad, as Jemmy Fox declared I was.\"\n\n\"Jemmy is older, and he should have known better than to say anything of\nthe sort. He must have lost his temper sadly; because he could never\nhave thought it. You have not been what he calls a cad; but in your\nhaste and misery, you came to the wrong decision. I have spoken\nstrongly, Tom, my boy; more strongly perhaps than I should have done.\nBut your mother is in weak health now; and you are all in all to her.\"\n\n\"The best you can show me to be is a brute; and I am not sure that that\nis not worse than a cad. I ought to be kicked every inch of the way\nhome; and I'll go there as fast as if I was.\"\n\n\"That won't do at all,\" replied the Curate smiling. \"To go is your duty;\nbut not to rush in like a thunderbolt, and amaze them. They have been so\nanxious about your return, that it must be broken very gently to them.\nIf you wish it, and can wait a little while, I will go with you, and\nprepare them for it.\"\n\n\"Sir, if you only would--but no, I don't deserve it. It is a great deal\ntoo much to expect of you.\"\n\n\"What is the time? Oh, a quarter past four. At half past, I have to\nbaptise a child well advanced in his seventh year, whose parents have\nmade it the very greatest personal favour to me, to allow him to be\n'crassed'--as they express it. And I only discovered their neglect, last\nweek! Who am I to find fault with any one? If you don't mind waiting for\nabout half-an-hour, I will come back for you, and meanwhile Mrs.\nMuggridge will make your hat look better; Master Jemmy must have lost\nhis temper too, I am afraid. Good-bye for the moment; unless I am\npunctual to the minute, I know too well what will happen--they will all\nbe off. For they 'can't zee no vally in it,' as they say. Alas, alas,\nand we are wild about Missions to Hindoos, and Hottentots!\"\n\nAs soon as Mr. Penniloe had left the house, the youth, who had been\nlowered in his own esteem, felt a very strong desire to go after him.\nPossibly this was increased by the sad reproachful gaze of Thyatira;\nwho, as an old friend, longed to hear all about him, but was too\nwell-mannered to ask questions. Cutting all consideration short--which\nis often the best thing to do with it--he put on his fairly\nre-established hat, and cared not a penny whether Mrs. Channing, the\nbaker's wife, was taking a look into the street or not; or even Mrs.\nTapscott, with the rosemary over her window.\n\nThen he turned in at the lych-gate, thinking of the day when his\nfather's body had lain there (as the proper thing was for a body to do)\nand then he stood in the churchyard, where the many ways of death\ndivided. Three main paths, all well-gravelled, ran among those who had\ntoddled in the time of childhood down them, with wormwood and\nstock-gilly flowers in their hands; and then sauntered along them, with\nhands in pockets, and eyes for the maidens over tombstone-heads; and\nthen had come limping along on their staffs; and now were having all\nthis done for them, without knowing anything about it.\n\nNone of these ways was at all to his liking. Peace--at least in\ndeath--was there, green turf and the rounded bank, gray stone, and the\nun-household name, to be made out by a grandchild perhaps, proud of\nskill in ancient letters, prouder still of a pocket-knife. What a faint\nscratch on soft stone! And yet the character far and away stronger than\nthat of the lettered times that follow it.\n\nYoung Waldron was not of a morbid cast, neither was his mind\nintrospective; as (for the good of mankind) is ordained to those who\nhave the world before them. He turned to the right by a track across the\ngrass, followed the bend of the churchyard wall, and fearing to go any\nfurther, lest he should stumble on his father's outraged grave, sat down\nupon a gap of the gray enclosure. This gap had been caused by the sweep\nof tempest that went up the valley at the climax of the storm. The wall,\nbeing low, had taken little harm; but the great west gable of the Abbey\nhad been smitten, and swung on its back, as a trap-door swings upon its\nhinges. Thick flint structure, and time-worn mullion, massive buttress,\nand deep foundation, all had gone flat, and turned their fangs up,\nrending a chasm in the tattered earth. But this dark chasm was hidden\nfrom view, by a pile of loose rubble, and chunks of flint, that had\nrattled down when the gable fell, and striking the cross-wall had lodged\nthereon, breaking the cope in places, and hanging (with tangles of ivy,\nand tufts of toad-flax) over the interval of wall and ruin, as a\nsnowdrift overhangs a ditch.\n\nHere the young man sat down; as if any sort of place would do for him.\nThe gap in the wall was no matter to him, but happened to suit his\ndowncast mood, and the misery of the moment. Here he might sit, and\nwait, until Mr. Penniloe had got through a job, superior to the\nburial-service, because no one could cut you in pieces, directly\nafterwards, without being hanged for it. He could see Mr. Penniloe's\nblack stick, standing like a little Parson--for some of them are proud\nof such resemblance--in the great south porch of the church; and thereby\nhe knew that he could not miss his friend. As he lifted his eyes to the\nancient tower, and the black yew-tree still steadfast, and the four\nvanes (never of one opinion as to the direction of the wind, in anything\nless than half a gale), and the jackdaws come home prematurely, after\ndigging up broad-beans, to settle their squabble about their nests; and\nthen as he lowered his gaze to the tombstones, and the new\nfoundation-arches, and other labours of a parish now so hateful to\nhim--heavy depression, and crushing sense of the wrath of God against\nhis race, fell upon his head; as the ruin behind him had fallen on its\nown foundations.\n\nHe felt like an old man, fain to die, when time is gone weary and empty.\nWhat was the use of wealth to him, of bodily strength, of bright\nambition to make his Country proud of him, even of love of dearest\nfriends, and wedded bliss--if such there were--and children who would\nhonour him? All must be under one black ban of mystery insoluble; never\ncould there be one hearty smile, one gay thought, one soft delight; but\never the view of his father's dear old figure desecrated, mangled,\nperhaps lectured on. He could not think twice of that, but groaned--\"The\nLord in Heaven be my help! The Lord deliver me from this life?\"\n\nHe was all but delivered of this life--happy, or wretched--it was all\nbut gone. For as he flung his body back, suiting the action to his agony\nof mind--crash went the pile of jagged flint, the hummocks of dead\nmortar, and the wattle of shattered ivy. He cast himself forward, just\nin time, as all that had carried him broke and fell, churning, and\ngrinding, and clashing together, sending up a cloud of powdered lime.\n\nSo sudden was the rush, that his hat went with it, leaving his brown\ncurls grimed with dust, and his head for a moment in a dazed condition,\nas of one who has leapt from an earthquake. He stood with his back to\nthe wall, and the muscles of his great legs quivering, after the strain\nof their spring for dear life. Then scarcely yet conscious of his\nhair-breadth escape, he descried Mr. Penniloe coming from the porch, and\nhastened without thought to meet him.\n\n\"Billy-jack!\" said the clergyman, smiling, yet doubtful whether he ought\nto smile. \"They insisted on calling that child 'Billy-jack.'\n'William-John' they would not hear of. I could not object, for it was\ntoo late; and there is nothing in it uncanonical. But I scarcely felt as\nI should have done, when I had to say--'Billy-jack, I baptise thee,'\netc. I hope they did not do it to try me. Now the Devonshire mind is\nvery deep and subtle; though generally supposed to be the simplest of\nthe simple. But what has become of your hat, my dear boy? Surely\nThyatira has had time enough to clean it.\"\n\n\"She cleaned it beautifully. But it was waste of time. It has gone down\na hole. Come, and I will show you. I wonder my head did not go with it.\nWhat a queer place this has become!\"\n\n\"A hole! What hole can there be about here?\" Mr. Penniloe asked, as he\nfollowed the young man. \"The downfall of the Abbey has made a heap,\nrather than what can be called a hole. But I declare you are right! Why,\nI never saw this before; and I looked along here with Haddon, not more\nthan a week age. Don't come too near; it is safe enough for me, but you\nare like Neptune, a shaker of the earth. Alas for our poor ivy!\"\n\nHe put on his glasses, and peered through the wall-gap, into the\nflint-strewn depth outside. Part of the ruins, just dislodged, had\nrolled into a pit, or some deep excavation; the crown of which had\nbroken in, probably when the gable fell. The remnant of the churchyard\nwall was still quite sound, and evidently stood away from all that had\ngone on outside.\n\n\"Be thankful to God for your escape,\" Mr. Penniloe said, looking back at\nthe youth. \"It has indeed been a narrow one. If you had been carried\ndown there head-foremost, even your strong frame would have been crushed\nlike an egg-shell.\"\n\n\"I am not sure about that; but I don't want to try it. I think I can see\na good piece of my hat; and I am not going to be done out of it. Will\nyou be kind enough, sir, to wait, while I go round by the stile, and get\nin at that end? You see that it is easy to get down there; but a\nfrightful job from this side. You won't mind waiting, will you, sir?\"\n\n\"If you will take my advice,\" said the Curate, \"you will be content to\nlet well alone. It is the great lesson of the age. But nobody attends to\nit.\"\n\nThe young man did not attend to it; and for once Mr. Penniloe had given\nbad advice; though most correct in principle, and in practice too, nine\ntimes and a half out of every ten.\n\n\"Here I am, sir. Can you see me?\" Sir Thomas Waldron shouted up the\nhole. \"It is a queer place, and no mistake. Please to stop just where\nyou are. Then you can give me notice, if you see the ground likely to\ncave in. Halloa! Why, I never saw anything like it! Here's a stone arch,\nand a tunnel beyond it, just like what you've got at the rectory, only\never so much bigger. Looks as if the old Abbey had butted up against it,\nuntil it all got blown away. If I had got a fellow down here to help me,\nI believe I could get into it. But all these chunks are in the way.\"\n\n\"My dear young friend, it will soon be dark; and we have more important\nthings to see to. You are not at all safe down there; if the sides fell\nin, you would never come out alive.\"\n\n\"It has cost me a hat; and I won't be done. I can't go home without a\nhat, till dark. I am not coming up, till I know all about it. Do oblige\nme, sir, by having the least little bit of patience.\"\n\nMr. Penniloe smiled. The request, as coming from such a quarter, pleased\nhim. And presently the young man began to fling up great lumps of\nclotted flint, as if they were marbles, right and left.\n\n\"What a volcano you are!\" cried the Parson, as the youth in the crater\nstopped to breathe. \"It is nothing but a waste of energy. The hole won't\nrun away, my dear Tom. You had much better leave it for the proper man\nto-morrow.\"\n\n\"Don't say that. I am the proper man.\" How true his words were, he had\nno idea. \"But I hear somebody whistling. If I had only got a fellow, to\nkeep this stuff back, I could get on like a house on fire.\"\n\nIt was Pike coming back from the long pool in the meadow, with a pretty\nlittle dish of trout for supper. His whistling was fine; as a\nfisherman's should be, for want of something better in his mouth; and he\nnever got over the Churchyard stile, without this little air of\nconsolation for the ghosts.\n\nAs he topped the ridge of meadow that looks down on the river, Mr.\nPenniloe waved his hat to him, over the breach of the churchyard wall;\nand he nothing loth stuck his rod into the ground, pulled off his\njacket, and went down to help.\n\n\"All clear now. We can slip in like a rabbit. But it looks uncommonly\nblack inside, and it seems to go a long way underground;\" Waldron\nshouted up to the clergyman. \"We cannot do anything, without a light.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what, sir,\" Pike chimed in. \"This passage runs right into\nthe church, I do believe.\"\n\n\"That is the very thing I have been thinking;\" answered Mr. Penniloe. \"I\nhave heard of a tradition to that effect. I should like to come down,\nand examine it.\"\n\n\"Not yet, sir; if you please. There is scarcely room for three. And it\nwould be a dangerous place for you. But if you could only give us\nsomething like a candle----\"\n\n\"Oh, I know!\" The sage Pike suggested, with an angler's quickness. \"Ask\nhim to throw us down one of the four torches stuck up at the lych-gate.\nThey burn like fury; and I dare say you have got a lucifer, or a\nPromethean.\"\n\n\"Not a bad idea, Pike;\" answered Mr. Penniloe. \"I believe that each of\nthem will burn for half-an-hour.\"\n\nSoon he returned with the driest of them, from the iron loop under the\ncovered space; and this took fire very heartily, being made of twisted\ntow soaked in resin.\n\n\"I am rather big for this job;\" said Sir Thomas, as the red flame\nsputtered in the archway, \"perhaps you would like to go first, my young\nfriend.\"\n\n\"Very much obliged,\" replied Pike drawing back; \"but I don't seem to\nfeel myself called upon to rush into the bowels of the earth, among six\ncenturies of ghosts. I had better stop here, perhaps, till you come\nback.\"\n\n\"Very well. At any rate hold my coat. It is bad enough; I don't want to\nmake it worse. I shan't be long, I dare say. But I am bound to see the\nend of it.\"\n\nYoung Waldron handed his coat to Pike, and stooping his tall head with\nthe torch well in front of him, plunged into the dark arcade. Grim\nshadows flitted along the roof, as the sound of his heavy steps came\nback; then the torchlight vanished round a bend of wall, and nothing\ncould either be seen or heard. Mr. Penniloe, in some anxiety, leaned\nover the breach in the churchyard fence, striving to see what was under\nhis feet; while Pike mustered courage to stand in the archway--which was\nof roughly chiselled stone--but kept himself ready for instant flight,\nas he drew deep breaths of excitement.\n\nBy-and-by, the torch came quivering back, throwing flits of light along\nthe white-flint roof; and behind it a man, shaking worse than any\nshadow, and whiter than any torchlit chalk.\n\n\"Great God!\" He cried, staggering forth, and falling with his hand on\nhis heart against the steep side of the pit. \"As sure as there is a God\nin heaven, I have found my father!\"\n\n\"What!\" cried the Parson; \"Pike, see to the torch; or you'll both be on\nfire.\"\n\nIn a moment, he ran round by way of the stile, and slid into the pit,\nwithout thinking of his legs, laying hold of some long rasps of ivy.\nPike very nimbly leaped up the other side; this was not the sort of hole\nto throw a fly in.\n\n\"Give me the torch. You stay here, Tom. You have had enough of it.\" Mr.\nPenniloe's breath was short, because of the speed he had made of it. \"It\nis my place now. You stop here, and get the air.\"\n\n\"I think it is rather my place, than of any other man upon the earth. Am\nI afraid of my own dear dad? Follow me, and I will show him to you.\"\n\nHe went with a slow step, dazed out of all wonder--as a man in a dream\naccepts everything--down the dark passage again, and through the\nice-cold air, and the shivering fire. Then he stopped suddenly, and\nstooped the torch, stooping his curly head in lowliness behind it; and\nthere, as if set down by the bearers for a rest, lay a long oaken\ncoffin.\n\nMr. Penniloe came to his side, and gazed. At their feet lay the good and\ntrue-hearted Colonel, or all of him left below the heaven, resting\nplacidly, unprofaned, untouched by even the hand of time; unsullied and\nhonourable in his death, as in his loyal and blameless life.\n\nThe clear light fell upon the diamond of glass, (framed in the oak above\nhis face, as was often done then for the last look of love) and it\nshowed his white curls, and tranquil forehead, and eyelids for ever\nclosed against all disappointment.\n\nHis son could not speak, but sobbed, and shook, with love, and\nreverence, and manly grief. But the clergyman, with a godly joy, and\nimmortal faith, and heavenly hope, knelt at the foot, and lifted hands\nand eyes to the God of heaven.\n\n\"Behold, He hath not forsaken us! His mercy is over all His works. And\nhis goodness is upon the children of men.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII.\n\nTWO FINE LESSONS.\n\n\nAt the _Old Barn_ that afternoon, no sooner was young Sir Thomas gone,\nthan remarkable things began to happen. As was observed in a previous\ncase, few of us are yet so vast of mind, as to feel deeply, and fairly\nenjoy the justice of being served with our own sauce. Haply this is why\nsauce and justice are in Latin the self-same word. Few of us even are so\ncandid, as to perceive when it comes to pass; more often is a world of\ndifference found betwixt what we gave, and what we got.\n\nFox was now treated by Nicie's brother, exactly as he had treated Gilham\nabout his sister Christie. He was not remarkably rash of mind--which was\never so much better for himself and friends--yet he was quick of\nperception; and when his sister came and looked at him, and said with\ngentle sympathy--\"Oh, Jemmy, has Sir Thomas forbidden your bans? No\nwonder you threw his hat at him\"--it was a little more than he could\ndo, not to grin at the force of analogy.\n\n\"He is mad.\" He replied, with strong decision. Yet at the twinkle of her\neyes, he wondered whether she held that explanation valid, in a like\ncase, not so very long ago.\n\n\"I have made up my mind to it altogether;\" he continued, with the air\nmagnanimous. \"It is useless to strive against the force of\ncircumstances.\"\n\n\"Made up your mind to give up Nicie, because her brother disapproves of\nit?\" Christie knew well enough what he meant. But can girls be\nmagnanimous?\n\n\"I should think not. How can you be so stupid? What has a brother's\napproval to do with it? Do you think I care twopence for fifty thousand\nbrothers? Brothers are all very well in their way; but let them stick to\ntheir own business. A girl's heart is her own, I should hope; and her\nhappiness depends on herself, not her brother. I call it a great piece\nof impudence, for a brother to interfere in such matters.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Christie, and nothing more. Neither did she even smile; but\nwent to the window, and smoothed her apron, the pretty one she wore,\nwhen she was mixing water-colours.\n\n\"You shall come and see him now;\" said Jemmy, looking at the light that\nwas dancing in her curls, but too lofty to suspect that inward laughter\nmade them dance. \"It can't hurt him now; and my opinion is that it might\neven do him a great deal of good. I'll soon have him ready, and I'll\nsend his blessed mother to make another saucepanful of chicken broth.\nAnd Chris, I'll give you clear decks, honour bright.\"\n\n\"I am quite at a loss to understand your meaning.\" The mendacious\nChristie turned round, and fixed her bright eyes upon his most grandly;\nas girls often do, when they tell white lies--perhaps to see how they\nare swallowed.\n\n\"Very well then; that is all right. It will save a lot of trouble; and\nperhaps it is better to leave him alone.\"\n\n\"There again! You never seem to understand me, Jemmy! And of course, you\ndon't care how much it upsets a poor patient, never to see a change of\nfaces. Of course you are very kind; and so is Dr. Gronow; and poor Mrs.\nGilham is a most delightful person. Still, after being for all that time\nso desperately limited--that's not the word at all--I mean, so to some\nextent restricted, or if you prefer it prohibited, from--from any little\nchange, any sort of variety of expressions, of surroundings, of in fact,\nsociety----\"\n\n\"Ah yes, no doubt! Of etcetera, etcetera. But go you on floundering,\ntill I come back, and perhaps then you will know what you mean. Perhaps\nalso you would look a little more decent with your apron off,\" Dr. Fox\nsuggested, with the noble rudeness so often dealt out to sisters. \"Be\nsure you remind him that yesterday was Leap-year's day; and then perhaps\nyou will be able to find some one to understand you.\"\n\n\"If that is the case, you may be quite certain that I won't go near\nhim.\"\n\nBut before very long she thought better of that. Was it just to punish\none for the offences of another? With a colour like the first bud of\nmonthly rose peeping through its sepals in the southern corner, she ran\ninto the shrubbery--for there was nothing to call a garden--and gathered\na little posy of Russian violets and wild primrose. Then she pulled her\napron off, and had a good look at herself, and could not help knowing\nthat she had not seen a lovelier thing for a long time; and if love\nwould only multiply it by two,--and it generally does so by a\nthousand--the result would be something stupendous, ineffable, adorable.\n\nSuch thoughts are very bright and cheerful, full of glowing youth and\nkindness, young romance and contempt of earth. But the longer we plod on\nthis earth, the deeper we stick into it; as must be when the foot grows\nheavy, having no _talaria_. Long enduring pain produces a like effect\nwith lapse of years. The spring of the system loses coil, from being on\nperpetual strain; sad proverbs flock into the brain, instead of dancing\nverses.\n\nFrank Gilham had been ploughed and harrowed, clod-crushed, drilled, and\nscarified by the most advanced, enlightened, and practical of all\nmedical high-farmers. If ever Fox left him, to get a breath of air,\nGronow came in to keep the screw on; and when they were both worn out,\nyoung Webber (who began to see how much he had to learn, and what was\nfor his highest interest) was allowed to sit by, and do nothing. A\nconsultation was held, whenever the time hung heavily on their hands;\nand Webber would have liked to say a word, if it could have been uttered\nwithout a snub. Meanwhile, Frank Gilham got the worst of it.\n\nAt last he had been allowed to leave his bed, and taste a little of the\nfine Spring air, flowing down from Hagdon Hill, and bearing first waft\nof the furze-bloom. Haggard weariness and giddy lightness, and a vacant\nwondering doubt (as to who or what he was, that scarcely seemed worth\npuzzling out), would have proved to any one who cared to know it, that\nhis head had lain too long in one position, and was not yet reconciled\nto the change. And yet it should have welcomed this relief, if virtue\nthere be in heredity, inasmuch as this sofa came from White Post farm,\nand must have comforted the head of many a sick progenitor.\n\nThe globe of thought being in this state, and the arm of action\ncrippled, the question was--would heart arise, dispense with both, and\nhave its way?\n\nFor awhile it seemed a doubtful thing; so tedious had the conflict been,\nand such emptiness left behind it. The young man, after dreams most\nblissful, and hopes too golden to have any kin with gilt, was reduced to\nbare bones and plastered elbows, and knees unsafe to go down upon. But\nthe turn of the tide of human life quivers to the influence of heaven.\n\nIn came Christie, like a flush of health, rosy with bright maidenhood;\nyet tremulous as a lily is, with gentle fear and tenderness. Pity is\nakin to love--as those who know them both, and in their larger hearts\nhave felt them, for our smaller sakes pronounce--but when the love is\nfar in front, and pauses at the check of pride; what chance has pride,\nif pity comes, and takes her mistress by the hand, and whispers--\"try to\ncomfort him?\" None can tell, who are not in the case, and those who are\nknow little of it, how these strange things come to pass. But sure it is\nthat they have their way. The bashful, proud, light-hearted maiden,\nready to make a joke of love, and laugh at such a fantasy, was so\noverwhelmed with pity, that the bashfulness forgot to blush, the pride\ncast down its frightened eyes, and the levity burst into tears. But of\nall these things she remembered none.\n\nAnd forsooth they may well be considered doubtful, in common with many\nharder facts; because the house was turned upside down, before any more\ncould be known of it. There was coming, and going, and stamping of feet,\nhorses looking in at the door, and women calling out of it; and such a\nshouting and hurrahing, not only here but all over the village, that the\nPerle itself might well have stopped, like Sim\u00c3\u00b6is and Scamander, to ask\nwhat the fish out of water were doing. And it might have stopped long,\nwithout being much wiser; so thoroughly everybody's head was flown, and\neverybody's mouth filled with much more than the biggest ears found room\nfor.\n\nTo put it in order is a hopeless job, because all order was gone to\ngrit. But as concerns the _Old Barn_ (whose thatch, being used to quiet\neaves-droppings, had enough to make it stand up in sheaf again)--first\ndashed up a young man on horseback, (and the sympathetic nag was half\nmad also) the horse knocking sparks out of the ground, as if he had\nnever heard of lucifers, and the man with his legs all out of saddle,\nwaving a thing that looked like a letter, and shouting as if all\nliterature were comprised in viv\u00c3\u00a2 voce. Now this was young Farrant, the\nson of the Churchwarden; and really there was no excuse for him; for the\nFarrants are a very clever race; and as yet competitive examination had\nnot made the sight of paper loathsome to any mind cultivating\nself-respect.\n\n\"You come out, and just read this;\" he shouted to the _Barn_ in general.\n\"You never heard such a thing in all your life. All the village is\nmadder than any March hare. I shan't tell you a word of it. You come out\nand read. And if that doesn't fetch you out, you must be a clam of\noysters. If you don't believe me, come and see it for yourselves. Only\nyou will have to get by Jakes, and he is standing at the mouth, with his\nFrench sword drawn.\"\n\n\"In the name of Heaven, what the devil do you mean?\" cried Fox, running\nout, and catching fire of like madness, of all human elements the most\nexplosive, \"and this--why, this letter is the maddest thing of all! A\nman who was bursting to knock me down, scarcely two gurgles of the\nclock ago! And now, I am his beloved Jemmy! Mrs. Gilham, do come out.\nSurely that chicken has been stewed to death. Oh, Ma'am, you have some\nsense in you. Everybody else is gone off his head. Who can make head or\ntail of this? Let me entreat you to read it, Mrs. Gilham. Farrant,\nyou'll be over that colt's head directly. Mrs. Gilham, this is meant for\na saner eye than mine. Your head-piece is always full of\nself-possession.\"\n\nHighly flattered with this tribute, the old lady put on her spectacles,\nand read, slowly and decorously.\n\n\n     \"BELOVED JEMMY,\n\n     \"I am all that you called me, a hot-headed fool, and a cad; and\n     everything vile on the back of it. The doctors are the finest chaps\n     alive, because they have never done harm to the dead. Come down at\n     once, and put a bar across, because Jakes must have his supper.\n     Perlycross folk are the best in the world, and the kindest-hearted,\n     but we must not lett them go in there. I am off home, for if\n     anybody else was to get in front of me, and tell my mother, I\n     should go wild, and she would be quite upsett. When you have done\n     all you think proper, come up and see poor Nicie.\n\n     \"From your affectionate, and very sorry,\n\n     \"T. R. WALDRON.\"\n\n\n\"Now the other, Ma'am!\" cried Doctor Fox. \"Here is another from the\nParson. Oh come now, we shall have a little common sense.\"\n\n\n     \"MY DEAR JEMMY,\n\n     \"It has pleased the Lord, who never afflicts us without good\n     purpose, to remove that long and very heavy trouble from us. We\n     have found the mortal remains of my dear friend, untouched by any\n     human hand, in a hollow way leading from the Abbey to the Church.\n     We have not yet discovered how it happened; and I cannot stop to\n     tell you more, for I must go at once to Walderscourt, lest rumour\n     should get there before us; and Sir Thomas must not go alone, being\n     of rather headlong, though very noble nature. Sergeant Jakes has\n     been placed on guard, against any rash curiosity. I have sent for\n     the two Churchwardens and can leave it safely to them and to you,\n     to see that all is done properly. If it can be managed, without\n     undue haste, the coffin should be placed inside the Church, and the\n     doors locked until the morning. When that is done, barricade the\n     entrance to the tunnel; although I am sure that the people of our\n     parish would have too much right feeling, as well as apprehension,\n     to attempt to make their way in, after dark. To-morrow, I trust we\n     shall offer humble thanks to the Giver of all good, for this great\n     mercy. I propose to hold a short special service; though I fear\n     there is no precedent in the Prayer-book. This will take a vast\n     weight off your mind, as well as mine, which has been sorely tried.\n     I beg you not to lose a minute, as many people might become unduly\n     excited.\n\n     \"Most truly yours,\n\n     \"PHILIP PENNILOE.\"\n\n     \"P.S.--This relieves us also from another dark anxiety, simply\n     explaining the downfall of the S.E. corner of the Chancel.\"\n\n\n\"It seems hard upon me; but it must be right, because the Parson has\ndecreed it;\" Dr. Fox cried, without a particle of what is now called\n\"slavish adulation of the Church\"--which scarcely stuck up for herself\nin those days--but by virtue of the influence which a kind and good man\nalways gains, when he does not overstrain his rights. \"I am off, Mrs.\nGilham, I can trust you to see to the pair of invalids upstairs.\"\n\nThen he jumped upon young Mr. Farrant's horse, and leaving him to follow\nat foot leisure, dashed down the hill towards Perlycross. At the four\ncross-roads, which are the key of the position, and have all the village\nand the valley in command, he found as fine a concourse perhaps as had\nbeen there since the great days of the Romans. Not a rush of dread, and\ndoubting, and of shivering back-bones, such as had been on that hoary\nmorning, when the sun came through the fog, and showed Churchwarden\nFarmer John, and Channing the clerk, and blacksmith Crang, trudging from\nthe potato-field, full of ghastly tidings, and encountering at that very\nspot Sergeant Jakes, and Cornish, and the tremulous tramp of half the\nvillage, afraid of resurrection.\n\nInstead of hurrying from the churchyard, as a haunt of ghouls and\nfiends, all were hastening towards it now, with deep respect reviving.\nThe people who lived beyond the bridge, and even beyond the factory, and\nwere much inclined by local right to sit under the Dissenting\nminister--himself a very good man, and working in harmony with the\nCurate--many of these, and even some from Priestwell, having heard of\nit, pushed their right to know everything, in front of those who lived\nclose to the Church and looked through the railings every day. Farmer\nJohn Horner was there on his horse, trotting slowly up and down, as\nbrave as a mounted policeman is, and knowing every one by name called\nout to him to behave himself. Moreover Walter Haddon stood at the door\nof the _Ivy-bush_, with his coat off, and his shirtsleeves rolled, and\nready to double his fist at any man who only drank small beer, at the\nvery first sign of tumult. But candidly speaking this was needless,\npowerful as the upheaval was, and hot the spirit of enquiry; for the\nwives of most of the men were there, and happily in an English crowd\nthat always makes for good manners.\n\nFox was received with loud hurrahs, and many ran forward to shake his\nhand; some, who had been most black and bitter in their vile suspicions,\nhaving the manliness to beg his pardon, and abuse themselves very\nheartily. He forgave them with much frankness, as behoves an Englishman,\nand with a pleasant smile at their folly, which also is nicely national.\nFor after all, there is no other race that can give and take as we do;\nnot by any means headlong, yet insisting upon decision--of the other\nside, at any rate--and thus quickening the sense of justice upon the\naverage, in our favour.\n\nFox, with the truly British face of one who is understood at last, but\nmakes no fuss about it, gave up his horse at the lych-gate, and made off\nwhere he was beckoned for. Here were three great scaffold-poles and\nslings fixed over the entrance to the ancient under-way; and before dark\nall was managed well. And then a short procession, headed by the martial\nmarch of Jakes, conveyed into the venerable Church the mortal part of a\njust and kind man and a noble soldier, to be consigned to-morrow to a\nmore secure, and ever tranquil, and still honoured resting-place.\n\nThis being done, the need of understanding must be satisfied. Dr. Fox,\nand Dr. Gronow, with the two Churchwardens, and Channing the clerk,\ndescended the ladder into the hole, and with a couple of torches kindled\nwent to see the cause and manner of this strange yet simple matter--a\nfour-month mystery of darkness, henceforth as clear as daylight.\n\nWhen they beheld it, they were surprised, not at the thing itself--for\nit could scarcely have happened otherwise, under the circumstances--but\nat the coincidences, which had led so many people of very keen\nintelligence into, as might almost be said, every track, except the\nright one. And this brought home to them one great lesson--\"_If you wish\nto be sure of a thing, see it with your own good eyes._\" And\nanother--but that comes afterwards.\n\nThe passage, dug by the Monks no doubt, led from the Abbey directly\nwestward to the chancel of the Church, probably to enable them to carry\ntheir tapers burning, and discharge their duties there promptly and with\nvestments dry, in defiance of the weather. The crown, of loose flints\nset in mortar, was some eight feet underground, and the line it took was\nthat adopted in all Christian burial. The grave of the late Sir Thomas\nWaldron was prepared, as he had wished, far away from the family vault\n(which had sadly undermined the Church), and towards the eastern end of\nthe yard, as yet not much inhabited. As it chanced, the bottom lay\ndirectly along a weak, or worn-out part of the concrete arch below; and\nthe men who dug it said at the time that their spades had struck on\nsomething hard, which they took to be loose blocks of flint. However\nbeing satisfied with their depth, and having orders to wall the bottom,\nthey laid on either side some nine or ten courses of brickwork, well\nflushed in with strong and binding mortar; but the ends being safe and\nbricks running short, to save any further trouble, they omitted the\ncross-wall at the ends. Thus when the weight of earth cast in pressed\nmore and more heavily upon the heavy coffin, the dome of concreted\nflints below collapsed, the solid oaken box dropped quietly to the\nbottom of the tunnel, and the dwarf brick sides having no tie across,\nbut being well bonded together, and well-footed, full across the vacancy\ninto one another, forming a new arch, or more correctly a splay\nspan-roof, in lieu of the old arch which had yielded to the strain. Thus\nthe earth above took this new bearing, and the surface of the ground was\nno more disturbed than it always is by settlement.\n\nNo wonder then that in the hurried search, by men who had not been down\nthere before, and had not heard of any brickwork at the sides, and were\nat that moment in a highly nervous state, not only was the grave\nreported empty--which of course was true enough--but no suspicion was\nentertained that the bottom they came to (now covered with earth) was\nanything else than a rough platform for the resting-place. And the two\nwho could have told them better, being proud of their skill in\nfoundations, had joined the builders' staff, and been sent away to\ndistant jobs.\n\nIn the heat of foregone conclusion, and the terror created by the\nblacksmith's tale, and the sad condition of that faithful little _Jess_,\nthe report had been taken as final. No further quest seemed needful; and\nat Squire Mockham's order, the empty space had been filled in at once,\nfor fear of the excitement, and throng of vulgar gazers, gathering and\nthickening around the empty grave.\n\nSuch are the cases that make us wonder at the power of co-incidence, and\nthe very strange fact that the less things seem to have to do with one\nanother, the greater is their force upon the human mind, when it tries\nto be too logical.\n\nMany little things, all far apart, had been fetched together by fine\nreasoning process, and made to converge towards a very fine error, with\ncertainty universal.\n\nEven that humble agent, or patient, little _Jess_--despised as a dog, by\nthe many who have no delight in their better selves--had contributed\nvery largely to the confluence of panic. If she could only have thrown\nthe light of language on her woeful plight, the strongest clench to the\nblacksmith's tale would never have come near his pincers. For the slash\nthat rewarded her true love fell, not from the spade of a\nChurchyard-robber, but from a poacher's bill-hook. This has already been\nintimated; and Mr. Penniloe must have learned it then; if he had simply\ntaken time, instead of making off at five miles an hour, when Speccotty\nwanted to tell his tale. This should be a warning to Clergymen; for\nperhaps there was no other man in the parish, whose case the good\nparson would thus have postponed, without prospect of higher\nconsolation. And it does seem a little too hard upon a man, that because\nhis mind is gone astray unawares, his soul should drop out of\ncultivation!\n\nThat poor little spaniel was going home sadly, to get a bit of\nbreakfast, and come back to her duty; when trespassing unwittingly upon\nthe poacher's tricks, at early wink of daylight, she was taken for a\nminion of the Evil One, and met with a vigour which is shown too seldom,\nby even true sportsmen, to his emissaries. Perhaps before she quitted\nguard, she may have had a nip at the flowers on the grave, and dropped\nthem back, when she failed to make sweet bones of them.\n\nWithout further words--though any number of words, if their weight were\nby the score, would be too few--the slowest-headed man in Perlycross\nmight lay to his heart the second lesson, read in as mild a voice as\nPenniloe's, above. And without a word at all, he may be trusted to go\nhome with it; when the job is of other folk's hands, but his own pocket.\n\n\"_Never scamp your work_,\" was preached more clearly by this long\ntrouble, and degradation of an honourable parish, than if Mr. Penniloe\nhad stood in the pulpit, for a week of Sundays, with the mouth of King\nSolomon laid to his ear, and the trump of the Royal Mail upon his lips.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV.\n\nAND ONE STILL FINER.\n\n\nIf it be sweet to watch at ease the troubles of another, how much\nsweeter to look back, from the vantage ground of happiness, upon one's\nown misfortunes! To be able to think--\"well, it was too bad! Another\nweek would have killed me. How I pulled through it, is more than I can\ntell; for everybody was against me! And the luck--the luck kept playing\nleap-frog; fifty plagues all upon one another's back; and my poor little\nself at the bottom. Not a friend came near me; they were all so sorry,\nbut happened to be frightfully down themselves. I assure you, my dear,\nif it had not been for you, and the thought of our blessed children, and\nperhaps my own--well, I won't say 'pluck,' but determination to go\nthrough with it; instead of arranging these flowers for dinner, you\nwould have been wreathing them for a sadder purpose.\"\n\nThe lady sheds a tear, and says--\"Darling Jack, see how you have made my\nhand shake! I have almost spoiled that truss of Hoya, and this\nSchubertia won't stand up. But you never said a word about it, at the\ntime! Was that fair to me, Jack?\" And the like will come to pass again,\nperhaps next year, perhaps next week.\n\nBut the beauty of country-life, as it then prevailed (ere the hungry\nhawk of Stock-exchange poised his wings above the stock-dove) was to\ntake things gently, softly, with a cooing faith in goodness, both above\nus and around. Men must work; but being born (as their best friends, the\nhorses, are), for that especial purpose, why should they make it still\nmore sad, by dwelling upon it, at the nose-bag time? How much wiser to\nallow that turbulent bit of stuff, the mind, to abide at ease, and take\nthings in, rather than cast them forth half-chewed, in the style of our\npresent essayists?\n\nNow this old village was the right sort of place, to do such things,\nwithout knowing it. There was no great leading intellect (with his hands\nreturned to feet), to beat the hollow drum, and play shrill fife, and\nset everybody tumbling over his best friend's head. The rule of the men\nwas to go on, according to the way in which their fathers went; talking\nas if they were running on in front, but sticking effectually to the old\ncoat-tail. Which in the long run is the wisest thing to do.\n\nThey were proud of their church, when the Sunday mood was on, and their\nchildren came home to tell about it.\n\nThere she was. Let her stand; if the folk with money could support her.\nIt was utterly impossible to get into their heads any difference betwixt\nthe Church in the churchyard, and the one that inhabits the sky above.\nWhen a man has been hard at work all the week, let his wife be his\nbetter half on Sunday.\n\nNothing that ever can be said, or done, by the most ardent \"pastor,\"\nwill ever produce that enthusiasm among the tegs of his flock, which\nspreads so freely among the ewes, and lambs. Mr. Penniloe would not be\ncalled a _Pastor_; to him the name savoured of a cant conceit. Neither\ndid he call himself a _Priest_; for him it was quite enough to be a\nClergyman of the Church of England; and to give his life to that.\n\nTherefore, when the time came round, and the turn of the year was fit\nfor it, this Parson of that humbler type was happy to finish, without\nfuss, the works that he had undertaken, with a lofty confidence in the\nLord, which had come to ground too often. His faith, though fine, had\nnever been of that grandly abstract quality, which expects the ravens to\ncome down, with bread instead of bills, and build a nest for sweet doves\n_gratis_. To pay every penny that was fairly due, and shorten no man of\nhis Saturday wage, towards the Sunday consolation; to perceive that\nbusiness must not be treated as a purely spiritual essence; and to know\nthat a great many very good people drip away (as tallow does from its\nown wick) from their quick flare of promises; also to bear the brunt of\nall, and cast up the toppling column, with the balance coming down on\nhis own chest--what wonder that he had scarcely any dark hair left, and\neven the silver was inclined to say adieu?\n\nWhen a man, who is getting on in years, comes out of a long anxiety,\nabout money, and honour, and his sense of right, he finds even in the\nsoft flush of relief that a great deal of his spring is gone. A Bachelor\nof Arts, when his ticks have been paid by a groaning governor, is fit\nand fresh to start again, and seldom dwells with due remorse upon the\nsacrifice Vicarious. His father also, if of right paternal spirit, soars\nabove the unpleasant subject; leaves it to the mother to drive home the\nlesson--which she feels already to be too severe--and says, \"Well, Jack,\nyou have got your degree; and that's more than the Squire's son can\nboast of.\"\n\nBut the ancient M.A. of ten lustres, who has run into debt on his own\nhook, and felt the hook running into him, is in very different plight,\neven when he has wriggled off. Parson Penniloe was sorely humble, his\nplacid forehead sadly wrinkled, and his kindly eyes uncertain how to\nlook at his brother men, even from the height of pulpit; when in his\ntremulous throat stuck fast that stern and difficult precept--\"Owe no\nman anything.\"\n\nEven the strongest of mankind can scarcely manage to come up to that,\nwhen fortune is not with him, and his family tug the other way. The\nglory of the Lord may be a lofty prospect, but becomes a cloudy pillar,\nwhen the column is cast up, and will not square with cash in hand.\nScarcely is it too much to say, that since the days of Abraham, it would\nhave been hard to find a man of stronger faith than Penniloe,--except at\nthe times when he broke down (in vice of matters physical) and proved at\none break two ancient creeds--_Exceptio probat regulam_; and _Corruptio\noptimi pessima_.\n\nWhile he was on the balance now, as a man of the higher ropes should be,\nlifting the upper end of his pole, that the glory of his parish shone\nagain, yet feeling the butt inclined to swag, by reason of the bills\nstuck upon it, who should come in to the audience and audit but young\nSir Thomas Waldron? This youth had thought perhaps too little of\nhimself,--because those candid friends, his brother-boys had always\nspoken of his body so kindly, without a single good word for his\nmind--but now he was authorized, and even ordered, by universal opinion\nto take a much fairer view of his own value.\n\nNothing that ever yet came to pass has gone into words without some\nshift of colour, and few things even without change of form; and so it\nwould have been beyond all nature if the events above reported had been\ntold with perfect accuracy even here. How much less could this be so, in\nthe hot excitement of the time, with every man eager to excel his\nneighbour's narrative, and every woman burning to recall it with her own\npure imagination! What then of the woman, who had been blessed enough to\nenrich the world, and by the same gift ennoble it, with the hero, who at\na stroke had purged the family, the parish, and the nation?\n\nNevertheless he came in gently, modestly, and with some misgivings, into\nthe room, where he had trembled, blushed, and floundered on all fours,\nover the old gray Latin steps, which have broken many a knee-cap.\n\n\"If you please, sir,\" he said to his old tutor, who alone had taught\nhim anything, for at Eton he had barely learned good manners; \"my mother\nbegs you to read this. And we are all ashamed of our behaviour.\"\n\n\"No, Tom, no. You have no cause for that. Your mother may have been a\nlittle hard at first. But she has meant to be just throughout. The\nmisery she has passed through--none but herself can realise.\"\n\n\"You see, sir, she does not sing out about things, as most women do; and\nthat of course makes it ever so much worse for her.\"\n\nThe young man spoke, like some deep student of feminine nature; but his\nwords were only those of the good housekeeper at Walderscourt. Mr.\nPenniloe took them in that light, and began to read without reply.\n\n\"Truly esteemed and valued sir. With some hesitation of the mind I come\nto say that in all I have said and done, my mind has been of the wrong\nintelligence most largely. It always appears in this land of Britain, as\nif nobody of it could make a mistake. But we have not in my country such\ngreat wisdom and good fortune. Also in any other European land of which\nI have the acquaintance, the natives are wrong in their opinions\nsometimes.\n\n\"But this does not excuse me of my mistake. I have been unjust to you\nand to all people living around my place of dwelling. But by my dear\nson, and his very deep sagacity, it has been made manifest that your\ngood people were considered guilty, without proper justice, of a wrong\nupon my husband's memory. Also that your good church, of which he\nthought so well in the course of his dear life, has treated him not with\nignominy, but with the best of her attention, receiving him into the\nsacred parts, where the Priests of our religion in the times of truth\nconversed. This is to me of the holiest and most gracious consolation.\n\n\"Therefore I entreat you to accept, for the uses of so good a building,\nthe little sum herewith committed to your care, which flows entirely\nfrom my own resources, and not from the property of my dear husband, so\nmuch engaged in the distribution of the law. When that is disengaged, my\ndear son Rodrigo, with my approbation will contribute from it the same\namount for the perfection of the matter.\"\n\n\"One, two, three, four, five. And every one of them a hundred pounds!\nMy dear Tom, I feel a doubt----\"\n\nMr. Penniloe leaned back and thought. He was never much excited about\nmoney, except when he owed it to, or for the Lord.\n\n\"I call it very poor amends indeed. What would ten times as much be,\nafter all that you have suffered? And how can you refuse it, when it is\nnot for yourself? My mother will be hurt most dreadfully, and never\nthink well again of the Church of England.\"\n\n\"Tom, you are right;\" Mr. Penniloe replied, while a smile flitted over\nhis conscience. \"I should indeed convey a false impression of the\ncharacter of our dear mother. But as for the other \u00c2\u00a3500--well----\"\n\n\"My father's character must be considered, as well as your good\nmother's.\" Sir Thomas was not strong at metaphor. \"And I am sure of one\nthing, sir. If he could have known what would happen about him, and how\nbeautifully every one behaved, except his own people--but it's no use\ntalking. If you don't take it, I shall join the Early Methodists. What\ndo you think of that, sir? I am always as good as my word, you know.\"\n\n\"Ah! Ah! It may be so;\" the Curate answered thoughtfully, returning to\nthe mildness of exclamation from which these troubles had driven him.\n\"But allow me a little time for consideration. Your mother's very\ngenerous gift, I can accept without hesitation, and have no right to do\notherwise. But as to your father's estate, I am placed in a delicate\nposition, by reason of my trusteeship; and it is possible that I might\ngo wrong; at any rate, I must consult----\"\n\n\"Mrs. Fox, sir, from Foxden!\" Thyatira Muggridge cried, with her face as\nred as a turkey's wattle, and throwing the door of the humble back-room\nas wide as if it never could be wide enough. For the lady was\nbeautifully arrayed.\n\n\"I come to consult, not to be consulted. My confidence in myself has\nbeen misplaced;\" said the mother of Jemmy and Christie, after making the\ndue salutation. \"Sir Thomas, I beg you not to go. You have some right to\na voice in the matter; if as they tell me at _Old Barn_, you have\nconquered your repugnance to my son, and are ready to receive him as\nyour brother-in-law.\"\n\n\"Madam, I was a fool,\" said Tom, offering his great hand with a sheepish\nlook. \"Your son has forgiven me; and I hope that you will. Jemmy is the\nfinest fellow ever born.\"\n\n\"A credit to his mother, as his mother always thought. And what is still\nbetter for himself, a happy man, in winning the affections of the\nsweetest girl on earth. I have seen your dear sister--what a gentle\ndarling!\"\n\n\"Nicie is very well in her way, madam. But she has a strong will of her\nown. Jemmy will find that out, some day. Upon the whole, I am sorry for\nhim.\"\n\n\"He talks in the very same way of his sister. If young men listened to\nyoung men, none of them would ever marry. Oh, Mr. Penniloe, you can be\ntrusted at any rate, to look at things from a higher point of view.\"\n\n\"I try sometimes; but it is not easy. And I generally get into scrapes,\nwhen I do. But I have one consolation. Nobody ever takes my advice.\"\n\n\"I mean to take it,\" Mrs. Fox replied, looking into his gentle eyes,\nwith the faith which clever women feel in a nature larger than their\nown. \"You need not suppose that I am impulsive. But I know what you are.\nWhen every one else in this stupid little place condemned my son,\nwithout hearing a word, there was one who was too noble, too good a\nChristian, to listen to any reason. He was right when the mother herself\nwas wrong. For I don't mind telling you, as I have even told my son,\nthat knowing what he is, I could not help suspecting that he--that he\nhad something to do with it. Not that Lady Waldron had any right\nwhatever--and it will take me a long time to forgive her, and her son is\nquite welcome to tell her that. What you felt yourself was quite\ndifferent, Sir Thomas.\"\n\n\"I can't see that my mother did any harm. Why, she even suspected her\nown twin-brother! If you were to bear ill-will against my mother----\"\n\n\"Of such little tricks I am incapable, Sir Thomas. And of course I can\nallow for foreigners. Even twenty years of English life cannot bring\nthem to see things as we do. Their nature is so--well, I won't say\nnarrow. Neither will I say 'bigoted,' although----\"\n\n\"We quite understand you, my dear madam.\" Mr. Penniloe was shocked at\nhis own rudeness, in thus interrupting a lady, but he knew that very\nlittle more would produce a bad breach betwixt Walderscourt and Foxden.\n\"What a difference really does exist among people equally just and\nupright----\"\n\n\"My dear mother is as just and upright as any Englishwoman in the world,\nProtestant or Catholic,\" the young man exclaimed, having temper on the\nbubble, yet not allowing it to boil against a lady. \"But if his own\nmother condemned him, how--I can't put it into words, as I mean it--how\ncan she be in a wax with my mother? And more than that--as it happens,\nMrs. Fox, my mother starts for Spain to day, and I cannot let her go\nalone.\"\n\n\"Now the Lord must have ordered it so,\" thought the Parson. \"What a\nclearance of hostile elements!\" But fearing that the others might not so\ntake it, he said only--\"Ah, indeed!\"\n\n\"To her native land?\" asked Mrs. Fox, as a Protestant not quite\nunbigoted; and a woman who longed to have it out. \"It seems an\nextraordinary thing just now. But perhaps it is a pilgrimage.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam, for about \u00c2\u00a3500,000,\" answered Sir Thomas, in his youthful\nTory vein, not emancipated yet from disdain of commerce; \"not for the\nsake of the money, of course; but to do justice to the brother she had\nwronged. Mr. Penniloe can tell you all about it. I am not much of a hand\nat arithmetic.\"\n\n\"We won't trouble any one about that now;\" the lady replied with some\nloftiness. \"But I presume that Lady Waldron would wish to see me, before\nshe leaves this country.\"\n\n\"Certainly she would if she had known that you were here. My sister had\nnot come back yet, to tell her. She will be disappointed terribly, when\nshe hears that you have been at Perlycross. But she is compelled to\ncatch the Packet; and I fear that I must say 'good-bye'; mother would\nnever forgive me, if she lost her voyage through any fault of mine.\"\n\n\"You see how they treat us!\" said Mrs. Fox of Foxden, when the young man\nhad made his adieu with great politeness. \"I suppose you understand it,\nMr. Penniloe, though your mind is so very much larger?\"\n\nThe clergyman scarcely knew what to say. He was not at all quick in the\nways of the world; and all feminine rush was beyond him. \"We must all\nallow for circumstances,\" was his quiet platitude.\n\n\"All possible allowance I can make;\" the lady replied with much\nself-command. \"But I think there is nothing more despicable than this\nsmall county-family feeling! Is Lady Waldron not aware that I am\nconnected with the very foremost of your Devonshire families? But\nbecause my husband is engaged in commerce, a military race may look down\nupon us! After all, I should like to know, what are your proudest\nlandowners, but mere agriculturists by deputy? I never lose my temper;\nbut it makes me laugh, when I remember that after all, they are simply\ndependent upon farming. Is not that what it comes to, Mr. Penniloe?\"\n\n\"And a very noble occupation, madam. The first and the finest of the\nways ordained by the Lord for the sustenance of mankind. Next to the\ncare of the human soul, what vocation can be----\"\n\n\"You think so. Then I tell you what I'll do, if only to let those\nWaldrons know how little we care for their prejudices. Everything\ndepends upon me now, in my poor husband's sad condition. I will give my\nconsent to my daughter's alliance--great people call it alliance, don't\nthey?--with a young man, who is a mere farmer!\"\n\n\"I am assured that he will make his way,\" Mr. Penniloe answered with\nsome inward smile, for it is a pleasant path to follow in the track of\nladies. \"He gets a higher price for pigs, than either of my\nChurchwardens.\"\n\n\"What could you desire more than that? It is a proof of the highest\ncapacity. Mr. and Mrs. Frank Gilham shall send their wedding cards to\nWalderscourt, with a prime young porker engraved on them. Oh, Mr.\nPenniloe, I am not perfect. But I have an unusual gift perhaps of\nlargeness of mind, and common sense; and I always go against any one,\nwho endeavours to get the whip-hand of me. And I do believe my darling\nChristie gets it from her mother.\"\n\n\"She is a most charming young lady, Mrs. Fox. What a treasure she would\nbe in this parish! The other day, she said a thing about our Church----\"\n\n\"Just like her. She is always doing that. And when she comes into her\nown money--but that is a low consideration. It is gratitude, my dear\nsir, the deepest and the noblest feeling that still survives in these\nlatter days. Without that heroic young man's behaviour, which has partly\ndisabled him for life, I fear, I should have neither son nor daughter.\nAnd you say that the Gilhams are of very good birth?\"\n\n\"The true name is _Guillaume_, I believe. Their ancestor came with the\nConqueror. Not as a rapacious noble, but in a most useful and peaceful\nvocation; in fact----\"\n\n\"Quite enough, Mr. Penniloe. In such a case, one scorns particulars. My\ndaughter was sure that it was so. But I doubted; although you can see it\nin his bearing. A more thoroughly modest young man never breathed; but I\nshall try to make him not afraid of me. He told my daughter that, in his\nopinion, I realised--but you would think me vain; and I was justly\nannoyed at such nonsense. However, since I have had your advice, I shall\nhesitate no longer.\"\n\nMrs. Fox smiled pleasantly, because her mind was quite made up, to save\nherself a world of useless trouble in this matter, and yet appear to\ntake the upper hand in her surrender.\n\nWondering what advice he could have been supposed to give, the mild yet\ngallant Parson led her to the Foxden carriage, which had halted at his\nouter gate, and opposite the school house. Here with many a bow they\nparted, thinking well of one another, and hoping for the like regard.\nBut as the gentle curate passed the mouth of the T\u00c3\u00a6narian tunnel leading\nto his lower realms, a great surprise befell him.\n\n\"What has happened? There is something wrong. Surely at this time of\nday, one ought to see the sunset through that hole,\" he communed with\nhimself in wonder, for the dark arcade ran from east to west. \"There\nmust be a stoppage somewhere. I am almost sure I can see two heads. Good\npeople, come out, whoever you may be.\"\n\n\"The fact of it is, sir,\" said Sergeant Jakes, marching out of the hole\nwith great dignity, though his hat was white with cob-webs; \"the fact of\nit is that this good lady hath received a sudden shock----\"\n\n\"No sir, no sir. Not at all like that, sir. Only as St. Paul saith in\nchapter 5 of Ephesians--'this is a great mystery.'\"\n\n\"It is indeed. And I must request to have it explained immediately.\"\n\nThyatira's blushes and the sparkling of her eyes made her look quite\npretty, and almost as good as young again, while she turned away with a\nfinal shot from the locker of old authority.\n\n\"You ought to be ashamed, sir, according to my thinking, to be standing\nin this wind so long, without no hat upon your head.\"\n\n\"You see, sir, it is just like this,\" the gallant sergeant followed up,\nwhen his love was out of hearing; \"time hath come for Mrs. Muggridge to\nbe married, now or never. It is not for me to say, as a man who fears\nthe Lord, that I think He was altogether right in the institooting of\nwedlock, supposing as ever He did so. But whether He did it, or whether\nHe did not, the thing hath been so taken up by the humankind--women\nparticular--that for a man getting on in years, 'tis the only thing\nrespectable. Thyatira hath proven that out of the Bible, many times.\"\n\n\"Mr. Jakes, the proper thing is to search the Scriptures for yourself.\"\n\n\"So Thyatira saith. But Lord! She findeth me wrong at every text, from\nlooking up to women so. If she holdeth by St. Paul, a quarter so much as\nshe quoteth him, there won't be another man in Perlycross with such a\nhome as I shall have.\"\n\n\"You have chosen one of the few wise virgins. Jakes, I trust that you\nwill be blest not only with a happy home in this world, but what is a\nthousand-fold more important, the aid of a truly religious wife, to lead\na thoroughly humble, prayerful, and consistent Christian life.\"\n\n\"Thank 'e, sir. Thank 'e. With the grace of God, she will; and my first\nprayer to the Lord in heaven will be just this--to let me live long\nenough for to see that young fool of a Bob the butcher ahanging fom his\nown steelyard. By reason of the idiot he hath made of his self, by\nmarrying of that silly minx, Tamar Haddon!\"\n\n\"The grace of God is boundless; and Tamar may improve. Try to make the\nbest of her, Mr. Jakes. She will always look up to you, I am sure,\nfeeling the strength of your character, and the example of higher\nprinciples.\"\n\n\"She!\" replied the sergeant without a blush, but after a keen\nreconnoitring glance. \"The likes of her doesn't get no benefit from\nexample. But I must not keep you, sir, so long without your hat on.\"\n\n\"This is a day of many strange events,\" Mr. Penniloe began to meditate,\nas he leaned back in his long sermon-chair, with the shadows of the\nSpring night deepening. \"Lady Waldron gone, to support her brother's\ncase in Spain, because she had so wronged him. A thousand pounds\nsuddenly forthcoming, to lift us out of our affliction; sweet Nicie left\nin the charge of Mrs. Webber, who comes to five at Walderscourt;\nChristie Fox allowed to have her own way, as she was pretty sure to do;\nand now Thyatira, Thyatira Muggridge, not content to lead a quiet,\nuseful, respectable, Christian, and well-paid life, but launched into\nmatrimony with a man of many stripes! I know not how the school will be\nconducted, or my own household, if it comes to that. Truly, when a\nclergyman is left without a wife----\"\n\n\"I want to come in, and the door won't open\"--a clear but impatient\nvoice was heard--\"I want to see you, before anybody else does.\" And then\nanother shake was given.\n\n\"Why, Zip, my dear child! Zip, don't be so headlong. I thought you were\nlearning self-command. Why, how have you come? What is the meaning of\nall this?\"\n\n\"Well, now they may kill me, if they like. I told them I would hear your\nvoice again, and then they might skin me, if it suited them. I won't\nhave their religion. There is none of it inside them. You are the only\none I ever saw, that God has made with his eyes open. I like them very\nwell, but what are they to you? Why, they won't let me speak as I was\nmade! It is no good sending me away again. Parson, you mustn't stand up\nlike that. Can't you see that I want to kiss you?\"\n\n\"My dear little child, with all my heart. But I never saw any one half\nso----\"\n\n\"Half so what? I don't care what, so long as I have got you round the\nneck,\" cried the child as she covered his face with kisses, drawing back\nevery now and then, to look into his calm blue eyes with flashes of\nadoration. \"The Lord should have made me your child, instead of that\nwell-conducted waxy thing--look at my nails! She had better not come\nnow.\"\n\n\"Alas! Have you cultivated nothing but your nails? But why did the good\nladies send you home so soon? They said they would keep you until\nWhitsuntide.\"\n\n\"I got a punishment on purpose, and I let the old girls go to dinner.\nThen I said the Lord's Prayer, and slipped down the back stairs.\"\n\n\"And you plodded more than twenty miles alone! Oh Zip, what a difficult\nthing it will be to guide you into the ways of peace!\"\n\n\"They say I talks broad a bit still sometimes, and they gives me ever so\nmuch roilying. But I'd sit up all night with a cork in my mouth, if so\nbe, I could plaize 'e, Parson.\"\n\n\"You must want something better than a cork, my dear\"--vexed as he was,\nMr. Penniloe admired the vigorous growth and high spirit of the\nchild--\"after twenty-two miles of our up and down roads. Now go to Mrs.\nMuggridge, but remember one thing--if you are unkind to my little Fay,\nhow can you expect me to be kind to you?\"\n\n\"Not a very lofty way for me to put it,\" he reflected, while Zip was\nbeing cared for in the kitchen; \"but what am I to do with that strange\nchild? If the girl is mother to the woman, she will be none of the choir\nAngelic, contented with duty, and hymns of repose. If 'nature maketh\nnadders,' as our good people say, Zippy[2] hath more of sting than sugar\nin her bowl.\"\n\nBut when the present moment thrives, and life is warm and active, and\nthose in whom we take delight are prosperous and happy, what is there\nwhy we should not smile, and keep in tune with all around, and find the\nflavour of the world returning to our relish? This may not be of the\nnoblest style of thinking, or of living; but he who would, in his little\nway, rather help than harm his fellows, soon finds out that it cannot be\ndone by carping and girding at them. By intimacy with their lower parts,\nand rank insistence on them, one may for himself obtain some power,\nyielded by a hateful shame. But who esteems him, who is better for his\nfetid labours, who would go to him for comfort when the world is waning,\nwho--though in his home he may be loveable--can love him?\n\nMr. Penniloe was not of those who mount mankind by lowering it. From\nyear to year his influence grew, as grows a tree in the backwood age,\nthat neither shuns nor defies the storm. Though certain persons opposed\nhim still--as happens to every active man--there was not one of them\nthat did not think all the others wrong in doing so. For instance Lady\nWaldron, when she returned with her son from Spain, thought Mrs. Fox by\nno means reasonable, and Mrs. Fox thought Lady Waldron anything but\nsensible, when either of them differed with the clergyman and the other.\nFor verily it was a harder thing to settle all the important points\nconcerning Nicie and Jemmy Fox, than to come to a perfect understanding\nin the case of Christie and Frank Gilham.\n\nHowever the parish was pleased at last to hear that everything had been\narranged; and a mighty day it was to be for all that pleasant\nneighbourhood, although no doubt a quiet, and as every one hoped, a\nsober one. On account of her father's sad condition, Christie as well as\nNicie, was to make her vows in the grand old church, which was not\nwholly finished yet, because there was so much more to do, through the\nfine influx of money. Currency is so called perhaps, not only because it\nruns away so fast, but also because it runs together; the prefix being\nomitted through our warm affection and longing for the terms of\nfamiliarity. At any rate the Parson and the stout Churchwardens of\nPerlycross had just received another hundred pounds when the following\ninterview came to pass.\n\nIt was on the bank of the crystal Perle, at the place where the\nPriestwell brook glides in, and a single plank without a handrail\ncrosses it into the meads below. Here are some stickles of good speed,\nand right complexion, for the fly to float quietly into a dainty mouth,\nand produce a fine fry in the evening; and here, if any man rejoice not\nin the gentle art, yet may he find sweet comfort and release of worldly\ntrouble, by sitting softly on the bank, and letting all the birds sing\nto him, and all the flowers fill the air, and all the little waves go\nby, as his own anxieties have gone.\n\nSometimes Mr. Penniloe, whenever he could spare the time, allowed his\nheart to go up to heaven, where his soul was waiting for it and\nwondering at its little cares. And so on this fair morning of the May,\nhere he sat upon a bank of Spring, gazing at the gliding water through\nthe mute salaam of twigs.\n\n\"Reverend, I congratulate you. Never heard of a finer hit. A solid\nhundred out of Gowler! Never bet with a parson, eh? I thought he knew\nthe world too well.\"\n\nA few months back and the clergyman would have risen very stiffly, and\nkept his distance from this joke. But now he had a genuine liking for\nthis \"Godless Gronow,\" and knew that his mind was the worst part of him.\n\n\"Doctor, you know that it was no bet;\" he said, as he shook hands\nheartily. \"Nevertheless I feel some doubts about accepting----\"\n\n\"You can't help it. The money is not for yourself, and you rob the\nChurch, if you refuse it. The joke of it is that I saw through the\nmill-stone, where that conceited fellow failed. Come now, as you are a\nsporting man, I'll bet you a crown that I catch a trout in this little\nstickle above the plank.\"\n\n\"Done!\" cried Mr. Penniloe, forgetting his position, but observing\nGronow's as he whirled his flies.\n\nThe doctor threshed heartily, and at his very best; even bending his\nback as he had seen Pike do, and screwing up his lips, and keeping, in a\nstrict line with his line, his body and his mind and whole existence.\n\nMr. Penniloe's face wore an amiable smile, as he watched the intensity\nof his friend. Crowns in his private purse were few and far between, and\nif he should attain one by the present venture, it would simply go into\nthe poor-box; yet such was his sympathy with human nature that he hoped\nagainst hope to see a little trout pulled out. But the willows bowed\nsweetly, and the wind went by, and the water flowed on, with all its\nclever children safe.\n\n\"Here you are, Reverend!\" said the philosophic Gronow, pulling out his\ncart-wheel like a man; \"you can't make them take you when they don't\nchoose, can you? But I'll make them pay out for it, when they begin to\nrise.\"\n\n\"The fact of it is that you are too skilful, doctor; and you let them\nsee so much of you that they feel it in their hearts.\"\n\n\"There may be truth in that. But my own idea is, that I manage to instil\ninto my flies too keen a sense of their own dependence upon me. Now what\nam I to do? I must have a dish and a good dish too of trout, for this\nevening's supper. You know the honour and the pleasure I am to have of\ngiving the last bachelor and maiden feast to the heroes and heroines of\nto-morrow, Nicie and Jemmy Fox, Christie and Frank Gilham. Their people\nare glad to be quit of them in the fuss, and they are too glad to be out\nof it. None of your imported stuff for me. Nothing is to be allowed upon\nthe table, unless it is the produce of our own parish. A fine\nfore-quarter, and a ripe sirloin, my own asparagus, and lettuce, and\nsea-kail, and frame-potatoes in their jackets. Stewed pears and clotted\ncream, grapes, and a pine-apple (coming of course from Walderscourt)--oh\nReverend, what a good man you would be, if you only knew what is good to\neat!\"\n\n\"But I do. And I shall know still better by and by. I understood that I\nwas kindly invited.\"\n\n\"To be sure, and one of the most important. But I must look sharp, or I\nshall never get the fish. By the by, you couldn't take the rod for half\nan hour, could you? I hear that you have been a fine hand at it.\"\n\nMr. Penniloe stood with his hand upon a burr-knot of oak, and looked at\nthe fishing-rod. If it had been a good, homely, hard-working, and\nplain-living bit of stuff, such as Saint Peter might have swung upon the\nbanks of Jordan, haply the parson might have yielded to the sweet\ntemptation. For here within a few clicks of reel was goodly choice of\nmany waters, various as the weather--placid glides of middle currents\nrippling off towards either bank, petulant swerves from bank, or hole,\nwith a plashing and a murmur and a gurgling from below, and then a\nspread of quiet dimples deepening to a limpid pool. Taking all the\ntwists and turns of river Perle and Priestwell brook, there must have\nbeen a mile of water in two flowery meadows, water bright with stickle\nruns, gloomy with still corners, or quivering with crafty hovers where a\nking of fish might dwell.\n\nBut lo, the king of fishermen, or at least the young prince was coming!\nThe doctor caught the parson's sleeve, and his face assumed its worst\nexpression, perhaps its usual one before he took to Church-going and\nfly-fishing.\n\n\"Just look! Over there, by that wild cherry-tree!\" He whispered very\nfiercely. \"I am sure it's that sneak of a Pike once more. Come into this\nbush, and watch him. I thought he was gone to Oxford. Why, I never saw\nhim fishing once last week.\"\n\n\"Pike is no sneak, but a very honest fellow,\" his tutor answered warmly.\n\"But I was obliged by a sad offence of his to stop him from handling the\nrod last week. He begged me to lay it on his back instead. The poor boy\nscarcely took a bit of food. He will never forget that punishment.\"\n\n\"Well he seems to be making up for it now. What luck he has, and I get\nnone!\"\n\nMr. Penniloe smiled as his favourite pupil crossed the Perle towards\nthem. He was not wading--in such small waters there is no necessity for\nthat--but stepping lightly from pile to pile and slab to slab, where the\nrelics of an ancient weir stood above the flashing river. Whistling\nsoftly, and calmly watching every curl and ripple, he was throwing a\nlong line up the stream, while his flies were flitting as if human\ngenius had turned them in their posthumous condition into moths. His rod\nshowed not a glance of light, but from spike to top-ring quivered with\nthe vigilance of death.\n\nWhile the envious Gronow watched, with bated breath and teeth set hard,\ntwo or three merry little trout were taught what they were made for;\nthen in a soft swirl near the bank that dimpled like a maiden's cheek,\nan excellent fish with a yellow belly bravely made room in it for\nsomething choice. Before he had smacked his lips thoroughly, behold\nanother fly of wondrous beauty--laced with silver, azure-pinioned, and\nwith an exquisite curl of tail--came fluttering through the golden world\nso marvellous to the race below. The poor fly shuddered at the giddy\ngulf, then folded his wings and fell helpless. \"I have thee,\" exclaimed\nthe trout,--but ah! more truly the same thing said the Pike. A gallant\nstruggle, a thrilling minute, silvery dashes, and golden rolls, and\nthere between Dr. Gronow's feet lay upon Dr. Gronow's land a visitor he\nwould have given half the meadow to have placed there.\n\n\"Don't touch him,\" said Pike, in the calmest manner; \"or you'll be sure\nto let him in again. He will turn the pound handsomely, don't you\nthink?\"\n\n\"A cool hand, truly, this pupil of yours!\" quoth the doctor to the\nparson. \"To consult me about the weight of my own fish, and then put him\nin his basket! Young man, this meadow belongs to me.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, I dare say; but the fish don't live altogether in the meadow.\nAnd I never heard that you preserve the Perle. Priestwell brook you do,\nI know. But I don't want to go there, if I might.\"\n\n\"I dare say. Perhaps the grapes are sour. Never mind; let us see how you\nhave done. I find them taking rather short to-day. Why you don't mean to\nsay you have caught all those!\"\n\n\"I ought to have done better,\" said the modest Pike, \"but I lost two\nvery nice fish by being in too much of a hurry. That comes of being\nstopped from it all last week. But I see you have not been lucky yet.\nYou are welcome to these, sir, if Mr. Penniloe does not want them. By\nstrict right, I dare say they belong to you.\"\n\n\"Not one of them, Mr. Pike. But you are very generous. I hope to catch a\nbasketful very shortly--still, it is just possible that this may not\noccur. I will take them provisionally, and with many thanks. Now, will\nyou add to the obligation, by telling, if your tutor has no objection,\nwhy he put you under such an awful veto?\"\n\n\"My boy, you are welcome to tell Dr. Gronow. It was only a bit of\nthoughtlessness, and your punishment has been severe.\"\n\n\"I shall never touch cobbler's wax again on Sunday. But I wanted to\nfinish a May-fly entirely of my own pattern; and so after church I was\ntouching up his wings, when in comes Mr. Penniloe with his London\nglasses on.\"\n\n\"And I am proud to assure you, Dr. Gronow, that the lad never tried to\ndeceive me. I should have been deeply pained, if he had striven to\nconceal it.\"\n\n\"Well done! That speaks well for both of you. Pike, you are a\nstraight-forward fellow. You shall have a day on my brook once a week.\nIs there anything more I can do for you?\"\n\n\"Yes sir, unless it is too much to ask; and perhaps Mr. Penniloe would\nlike to hear it too. Hopper and I have had many talks about it; and he\nsays that I am superstitious. But his plan of things is to cut for his\nlife over everything that he can see, without stopping once to look at\nit. And when he has jumped over it, he has no more idea what it was,\nthan if he had run under it. He has no faith in anything that he does\nnot see, and he never sees much of anything.\"\n\n\"Ha, Master Pike. You describe it well;\" said the doctor, looking at him\nwith much interest. \"Scepticism without enquiry. Reverend, that\nHop-jumper is not the right stuff for a bishop.\"\n\n\"If you please, Dr. Gronow, we will not discuss that now,\" the parson\nreplied with a glance at young Pike, which the doctor understood and\nheeded: \"What is it, my boy, that you would ask of Dr. Gronow, after\nserious debate with Peckover?\"\n\n\"Nothing sir, nothing. Only we would like to know, if it is not\ndisagreeable to any one, how he could have managed from the very first\nto understand all about Sir Thomas Waldron, and to know that we were all\nmaking fools of ourselves. I say that he must have seen a dream, like\nJacob, or have been cast into a vision, like so many other saints. But\nHopper says no; if there was any inspiration, Dr. Gronow was more likely\nto have got it from the Devil.\"\n\n\"Come now, Pike, and Hopper too,--if he were here to fly my brook,--I\ncall that very unfair of you. No, it was not you who said it; I can\nquite believe that. No fisherman reviles his brother. But you should\nhave given him the spike, my friend. Reverend, is this all the theology\nyou teach? Well, there is one answer as to how I knew it, and a very\nshort one--the little word, _brains_.\"\n\nMr. Penniloe smiled a pleasant smile, and simply said, \"Ah!\" in his\naccustomed tone, which everybody liked for its sympathy and good faith.\nBut Pike took up his rod, and waved his flies about, and answered very\ngravely--\"It must be something more than that.\"\n\n\"No sir,\" said the doctor, looking down at him complacently, and giving\na little tap to his grizzled forehead; \"it was all done here, sir--just\na trifling bit of brains.\"\n\n\"But there never can have been such brains before;\" replied Pike with an\nangler's persistence. \"Why everybody else was a thousand miles astray,\nand yet Dr. Gronow hit the mark at once!\"\n\n\"It is a little humble knack he has, sir. Just a little gift of\nthinking,\" the owner of all this wisdom spoke as if he were half-ashamed\nof it; \"from his earliest days it has been so. Nothing whatever to be\nproud of, and sometimes even a trouble to him, when others require to be\nset right. But how can one help it, Master Pike? There is the power, and\nit must be used. Mr. Penniloe will tell you that.\"\n\n\"All knowledge is from above,\" replied the gentleman thus appealed to;\n\"and beyond all question it is the duty of those who have this precious\ngift, to employ it for the good of others.\"\n\n\"Young man; there is a moral lesson for you. When wiser people set you\nright, be thankful and be humble. That has been my practice always,\nthough I have not found many occasions for it.\"\n\nPike was evidently much impressed, and looked with reverence at both his\nelders. \"Perhaps then,\" he said, with a little hesitation and the bright\nblush of ingenuous youth, \"I ought to set Dr. Gronow right in a little\nmistake he is making.\"\n\n\"If such a thing be possible, of course you should,\" his tutor replied\nwith a smile of surprise; while the doctor recovered his breath, made a\nbow, and said, \"Sir, will you point out my error?\"\n\n\"Here it is, sir,\" quoth Pike, with the certainty of truth overcoming\nhis young diffidence, \"this wire-apparatus in your brook--a very clever\nthing; what is the object of it?\"\n\n\"My _Ichthyophylax_? A noble idea that has puzzled all the parish. A\nsort of a grill that only works one way. It keeps all my fish from going\ndown to my neighbours, and yet allows theirs to come up to me; and when\nthey come up, they can never get back. At the other end of my property,\nI have the same contrivance inverted, so that all the fish come down to\nme, but none of them can go up again. I saw the thing offered in a\nsporting paper, and paid a lot of money for it in London. Reverend,\nisn't it a grand invention? It intercepts them all, like a sluicegate.\"\n\n\"Extremely ingenious, no doubt,\" replied the parson. \"But is not it what\na fair-minded person would consider rather selfish?\"\n\n\"Not at all. They would like to have my fish, if they could; and so I\nanticipate them, and get theirs. Quite the rule of the Scriptures,\nReverend.\"\n\n\"I think that I have read a text,\" said Master Pike, stroking his long\nchin, and not quite sure that he quoted aright; \"the snare which he laid\nfor others, in the same are his own feet taken!\"\n\n\"A very fine text,\" replied Dr. Gronow, with one of his most sarcastic\nsmiles; \"and the special favourite of the Lord must have realized it too\noften. But what has that to do with my _Ichthyophylax_?\"\n\n\"Nothing, sir. Only that you have set it so that it works in the wrong\ndirection. All the fish go out, but they can't come back. And if it is\nso at the upper end, no wonder that you catch nothing.\"\n\n\"Can I ever call any man a fool again?\" cried the doctor, when\nthoroughly convinced.\n\n\"Perhaps that disability will be no loss;\" Mr. Penniloe answered\nquietly.\n\nFOOTNOTE:\n\n[2] This proved too true, as may be shown hereafter.\n\n\nTHE END.\n\nLONDON:\n\nPRINTED BY WILLIAM CLOWES AND SONS, LIMITED,\n\nSTAMFORD STREET AND CHARING CROSS.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Perlycross, by R.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":129,"split":"train"}
