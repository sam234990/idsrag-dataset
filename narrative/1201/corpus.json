The inbred villagers have no interest in religion and Serge is portrayed giving several wildly enthusiastic Masses to his completely empty, near-derelict church. Serge not only seems unperturbed by this state of affairs but actually appears to have positively sought it out especially, for it gives him time to contemplate religious affairs and to fully experience the fervour of his faith. Eventually he has a complete nervous breakdown and collapses into a near-comatose state, whereupon his distant relative, the unconventional doctor Pascal Rougon (the central character of the last novel in the series, 1893's Le Docteur Pascal), places him in the care of the inhabitants of a nearby derelict stately home, Le Paradou.\nThe novel then takes a complete new direction in terms of both tone and style, as Serge \u00e2\u0080\u0094 suffering from amnesia and total long-term memory loss, with no idea who or where he is beyond his first name \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is doted upon by Albine, the whimsical, innocent and entirely uneducated girl who has been left to grow up practically alone and wild in the vast, sprawling, overgrown grounds of Le Paradou. The two of them live a life of idyllic bliss with many Biblical parallels, and over the course of a number of months, they fall deeply in love with one another; however, at the moment they consummate their relationship, they are discovered by Serge's monstrous former monseignor and his memory is instantly returned to him. Wracked with guilt at his unwitting sins, Serge is plunged into a deeper religious fervour than ever before, and poor Albine is left bewildered at the loss of her soulmate. As with many of Zola's earlier works, the novel then builds to a horrible climax.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Abbe Mouret\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Transgression, by Emile Zola\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Zola\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0098Rougon-Macquart\u00e2\u0080\u0099 series;\nbut in the amended and final scheme of that great literary undertaking,\nit occupies the ninth place. It proceeds from the sixth volume of the\nseries, \u00e2\u0080\u0098The Conquest of Plassans;\u00e2\u0080\u0099 which is followed by the two works\nthat deal with the career of Octave Mouret, Abbe Serge Mouret\u00e2\u0080\u0099s elder\nbrother. In \u00e2\u0080\u0098The Conquest of Plassans,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Serge and his half-witted\nsister, Desiree, are seen in childhood at their home in Plassans, which\nis wrecked by the doings of a certain Abbe Faujas and his relatives.\nSerge Mouret grows up, is called by an instinctive vocation to the\npriesthood, and becomes parish priest of Les Artaud, a well-nigh pagan\nhamlet in one of those bare, burning stretches of country with which\nProvence abounds. And here it is that \u00e2\u0080\u0098La Faute de l\u00e2\u0080\u0099Abbe Mouret\u00e2\u0080\u0099 opens\nin the old ruinous church, perched upon a hillock in full view of the\nsqualid village, the arid fields, and the great belts of rock which shut\nin the landscape all around.\n\nThere are two elements in this remarkable story, which, from the\nstandpoint of literary style, has never been excelled by anything that\nM. Zola has since written; and one may glance at it therefore from two\npoints of view. Taking it under its sociological and religious aspect,\nit will be found to be an indirect indictment of the celibacy of the\npriesthood; that celibacy, contrary to Nature\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fundamental law, which\nassuredly has largely influenced the destinies of the Roman Catholic\nChurch. To that celibacy, and to all the evils that have sprang from\nit, may be ascribed much of the irreligion current in France to-day.\nThe periodical reports on criminality issued by the French Ministers of\nJustice since the foundation of the Republic in 1871, supply materials\nfor a most formidable indictment of that vow of perpetual chastity which\nRome exacts from her clergy. Nowadays it is undoubtedly too late for\nRome to go back upon that vow and thereby transform the whole of her\nsacerdotal organisation; but, perhaps, had she done so in past times,\nbefore the spirit of inquiry and free examination came into being, she\nmight have assured herself many more centuries of supremacy than have\nfallen to her lot. But she has ever sought to dissociate the law of the\nDivinity from the law of Nature, as though indeed the latter were but\nthe invention of the Fiend.\n\nAbbe Mouret, M. Zola\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hero, finds himself placed between the law of\nthe Divinity and the law of Nature: and the struggle waged within him by\nthose two forces is a terrible one. That which training has implanted\nin his mind proves the stronger, and, so far as the canons of the Church\ncan warrant it, he saves his soul. But the problem is not quite frankly\nput by M. Zola; for if Abbe Mouret transgresses he does so unwittingly,\nat a time when he is unconscious of his priesthood and has no memory of\nany vow. When the truth flashes upon him he is horrified with himself,\nand forthwith returns to the Church. A further struggle between the\ncontending forces then certainly ensues, and ends in the final victory\nof the Church. But it must at least be said that in the lapses which\noccur in real life among the Roman priesthood, the circumstances are\naltogether different from those which M. Zola has selected for his\nstory.\n\nThe truth is that in \u00e2\u0080\u0098La Faute de l\u00e2\u0080\u0099Abbe Mouret,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 betwixt lifelike\nglimpses of French rural life, the author transports us to a realm of\npoesy and imagination. This is, indeed, so true that he has introduced\ninto his work all the ideas on which he had based an early unfinished\npoem called \u00e2\u0080\u0098Genesis.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 He carries us to an enchanted garden,\nthe Paradou--a name which one need hardly say is Provencal for\nParadise*--and there Serge Mouret, on recovering from brain fever,\nbecomes, as it were, a new Adam by the side of a new Eve, the fair and\nwinsome Albine. All this part of the book, then, is poetry in prose.\nThe author has remembered the ties which link Rousseau to the realistic\nschool of fiction, and, as in the pages of Jean-Jacques, trees, springs,\nmountains, rocks, and flowers become animated beings and claim their\nplace in the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mechanism. One may indeed go back far beyond\nRousseau, even to Lucretius himself; for more than once we are\nirresistibly reminded of Lucretian scenes, above which through M. Zola\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\npages there seems to hover the pronouncement of Sophocles:\n\n     No ordinance of man shall override\n     The settled laws of Nature and of God;\n     Not written these in pages of a book,\n     Nor were they framed to-day, nor yesterday;\n     We know not whence they are; but this we know,\n     That they from all eternity have been,\n     And shall to all eternity endure.\n\n\n  * There is a village called Paradou in Provence, between\n    Les Baux and Arles.\n\nAnd if we pass to the young pair whose duo of love is sung amidst the\nvaried voices of creation, we are irresistibly reminded of the Paul\nand Virginia of St. Pierre, and the Daphnis and Chloe of Longus. Beside\nthem, in their marvellous garden, lingers a memory too of Manon and\nDes Grieux, with a suggestion of Lauzun and a glimpse of the art of\nFragonard. All combine, all contribute--from the great classics to the\neighteenth century _petits maitres_--to build up a story of love\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rise\nin the human breast in answer to Nature\u00e2\u0080\u0099s promptings.\n\nM. Zola wrote \u00e2\u0080\u0098La Faute de l\u00e2\u0080\u0099Abbe Mouret\u00e2\u0080\u0099 one summer under the trees of\nhis garden, mindful the while of gardens that he had known in childhood:\nthe flowery expanse which had stretched before his grandmother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home\nat Pont-au-Beraud and the wild estate of Galice, between Roquefavour and\nAix-en-Provence, through which he had roamed as a lad with friends then\nboys like himself: Professor Baille and Cezanne, the painter. And into\nhis description of the wondrous Paradou he has put all his remembrance\nof the gardens and woods of Provence, where many a plant and flower\nthrive with a luxuriance unknown to England. True, in order to refresh\nhis memory and avoid mistakes, he consulted various horticultural\nmanuals whilst he was writing; of which circumstance captious critics\nhave readily laid hold, to proclaim that the description of the Paradou\nis a mere florist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s catalogue.\n\nBut it is nothing of the kind. The florist who might dare to offer\nsuch a catalogue to the public would be speedily assailed by all the\nhorticultural journalists of England and all the customers of villadom.\nFor M. Zola avails himself of a poet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s license to crowd marvel upon\nmarvel, to exaggerate nature\u00e2\u0080\u0099s forces, to transform the tiniest blooms\ninto giant examples of efflorescence, and to mingle even the seasons\none with the other. But all this was premeditated; there was a picture\nbefore his mind\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eye, and that picture he sought to trace with his pen,\nregardless of all possible objections. It is the poet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s privilege to\ndo this and even to be admired for it. It would be easy for some leaned\nbotanist, some expert zoologist, to demolish Milton from the standpoint\nof their respective sciences, but it would be absurd to do so. We ask of\nthe poet the flowers of his imagination, and the further he carries us\nfrom the sordid realities, the limited possibilities of life, the more\nare we grateful to him.\n\nAnd M. Zola\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Paradou is a flight of fancy, even as its mistress, the\nfair, loving, guileless Albine, whose smiles and whose tears alike go\nto our hearts, is the daughter of imagination. She is a flower--the very\nflower of life\u00e2\u0080\u0099s youth--in the midst of all the blossoms of her\ngarden. She unfolds to life and to love even as they unfold; she loves\nrapturously even as they do under the sun and the azure; and she dies\nwith them when the sun\u00e2\u0080\u0099s caress is gone and the chill of winter has\nfallen. At the thought of her, one instinctively remembers Malherbe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ode A Du Perrier:\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n     She to this earth belonged, where beauty fast\n          To direst fate is borne:\n     A rose, she lasted, as the roses last,\n          Only for one brief morn.\n\n\nFrench painters have made subjects of many episodes in M. Zola\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nworks, but none has been more popular with them than Albine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pathetic,\nperfumed death amidst the flowers. I know several paintings of great\nmerit which that touching incident has inspired.\n\nAlbine, if more or less unreal, a phantasm, the spirit as it were of\nNature incarnate in womanhood, is none the less the most delightful of\nM. Zola\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heroines. She smiles at us like the vision of perfect beauty\nand perfect love which rises before us when our hearts are yet young and\nfull of illusions. She is the ideal, the very quintessence of woman.\n\nIn Serge Mouret, her lover, we find a man who, in more than one respect,\nrecalls M. Zola\u00e2\u0080\u0099s later hero, the Abbe Froment of \u00e2\u0080\u0098Lourdes\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and \u00e2\u0080\u0098Rome.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nHe has the same loving, yearning nature; he is born--absolutely like\nAbbe Froment--of an unbelieving father and a mother of mystical mind.\nBut unlike Froment he cannot shake off the shackles of his priesthood.\nReborn to life after his dangerous illness, he relapses into the\nreligion of death, the religion which regards life as impurity, which\ndenies Nature\u00e2\u0080\u0099s laws, and so often wrecks human existence, as if\nindeed that had been the Divine purpose in setting man upon earth. His\nstruggles suggest various passages in \u00e2\u0080\u0098Lourdes\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and \u00e2\u0080\u0098Rome.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 In fact, in\nwriting those works, M. Zola must have had his earlier creation in\nmind. There are passages in \u00e2\u0080\u0098La Faute de l\u00e2\u0080\u0099Abbe Mouret\u00e2\u0080\u0099 culled from the\nwritings of the Spanish Jesuit Fathers and the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Imitation\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of Thomas\na Kempis that recur almost word for word in the Trilogy of the Three\nCities. Some might regard this as evidence of the limitation of M.\nZola\u00e2\u0080\u0099s powers, but I think differently. I consider that he has in both\ninstances designedly taken the same type of priest in order to show how\nhe may live under varied circumstances; for in the earlier instance\nhe has led him to one goal, and in the later one to another. And the\npassages of prayer, entreaty, and spiritual conflict simply recur\nbecause they are germane, even necessary, to the subject in both cases.\n\nOf the minor characters that figure in \u00e2\u0080\u0098La Faute de l\u00e2\u0080\u0099Abbe Mouret\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the\nchief thing to be said is that they are lifelike. If Serge is almost\nwholly spiritual, if Albine is the daughter of poesy, they, the others,\nare of the earth earthy. As a result of their appearance on the scene,\nthere are some powerful contrasting passages in the book. Archangias,\nthe coarse and brutal Christian Brother who serves as a foil to Abbe\nMouret; La Teuse, the priest\u00e2\u0080\u0099s garrulous old housekeeper; Desiree, his\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098innocent\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sister, a grown woman with the mind of a child and an almost\ncrazy affection for every kind of bird and beast, are all admirably\nportrayed. Old Bambousse, though one sees but little of him, stands\nout as a genuine type of the hard-headed French peasant, who invariably\nplaces pecuniary considerations before all others. And Fortune and\nRosalie, Vincent and Catherine, and their companions, are equally true\nto nature. It need hardly be said that there is many a village in France\nsimilar to Les Artaud. That hamlet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shameless, purely animal life has\nin no wise been over-pictured by M. Zola. Those who might doubt him need\nnot go as far as Provence to find such communities. Many Norman hamlets\nare every whit as bad, and, in Normandy, conditions are aggravated by a\nmarked predilection for the bottle, which, as French social-scientists\nhave been pointing out for some years now, is fast hastening the\ndegenerescence of the peasantry, both morally and physically.\n\nWith reference to the English version of \u00e2\u0080\u0098La Faute de l\u00e2\u0080\u0099Abbe Mouret\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nherewith presented, I may just say that I have subjected it to\nconsiderable revision and have retranslated all the more important\npassages myself.\n\n     MERTON, SURREY.                                    E. A. V.\n\n\n\n\n\nABBE MOURET\u00e2\u0080\u0099S TRANSGRESSION\n\n\n\n\nBOOK I\n\n\n\n\nI\n\nAs La Teuse entered the church she rested her broom and feather-brush\nagainst the altar. She was late, as she had that day began her\nhalf-yearly wash. Limping more than ever in her haste and hustling the\nbenches, she went down the church to ring the _Angelus_. The bare, worn\nbell-rope dangled from the ceiling near the confessional, and ended in a\nbig knot greasy from handling. Again and again, with regular jumps, she\nhung herself upon it; and then let her whole bulky figure go with it,\nwhirling in her petticoats, her cap awry, and her blood rushing to her\nbroad face.\n\nHaving set her cap straight with a little pat, she came back breathless\nto give a hasty sweep before the altar. Every day the dust persistently\nsettled between the disjoined boards of the platform. Her broom rummaged\namong the corners with an angry rumble. Then she lifted the altar cover\nand was sorely vexed to find that the large upper cloth, already darned\nin a score of places, was again worn through in the very middle, so\nas to show the under cloth, which in its turn was so worn and so\ntransparent that one could see the consecrated stone, embedded in the\npainted wood of the altar. La Teuse dusted the linen, yellow from long\nusage, and plied her feather-brush along the shelf against which she set\nthe liturgical altar-cards. Then, climbing upon a chair, she removed the\nyellow cotton covers from the crucifix and two of the candlesticks. The\nbrass of the latter was tarnished.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Dear me!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she muttered, \u00e2\u0080\u0098they really want a clean! I must give them a\npolish up!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen hopping on one leg, swaying and stumping heavily enough to drive in\nthe flagstones, she hastened to the sacristy for the Missal, which\nshe placed unopened on the lectern on the Epistle side, with its edges\nturned towards the middle of the altar. And afterwards she lighted the\ntwo candles. As she went off with her broom, she gave a glance round\nher to make sure that the abode of the Divinity had been put in proper\norder. All was still, save that the bell-rope near the confessional\nstill swung between roof and floor with a sinuous sweep.\n\nAbbe Mouret had just come down to the sacristy, a small and chilly\napartment, which a passage separated from his dining-room.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Good morning, Monsieur le Cure,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said La Teuse, laying her broom aside.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh! you have been lazy this morning! Do you know it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a quarter past\nsix?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And without allowing the smiling young priest sufficient time to\nreply, she added \u00e2\u0080\u0098I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve a scolding to give you. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another hole in\nthe cloth again. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no sense in it. We have only one other, and\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been ruining my eyes over it these three days in trying to mend it.\nYou will leave our poor Lord quite bare, if you go on like this.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAbbe Mouret was still smiling. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Jesus does not need so much linen, my\ngood Teuse,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he cheerfully replied. \u00e2\u0080\u0098He is always warm, always royally\nreceived by those who love Him well.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen stepping towards a small tap, he asked: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Is my sister up yet? I\nhave not seen her.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh, Mademoiselle Desiree has been down a long time,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 answered the\nservant, who was kneeling before an old kitchen sideboard in which the\nsacred vestments were kept. \u00e2\u0080\u0098She is already with her fowls and rabbits.\nShe was expecting some chicks to be hatched yesterday, and it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\ncome off. So you can guess her excitement.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Then the worthy woman broke\noff to inquire: \u00e2\u0080\u0098The gold chasuble, eh?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe priest, who had washed his hands and stood reverently murmuring a\nprayer, nodded affirmatively. The parish possessed only three chasubles:\na violet one, a black one, and one in cloth-of-gold. The last had to be\nused on the days when white, red, or green was prescribed by the ritual,\nand it was therefore an all important garment. La Teuse lifted it\nreverently from the shelf covered with blue paper, on which she laid\nit after each service; and having placed it on the sideboard, she\ncautiously removed the fine cloths which protected its embroidery. A\ngolden lamb slumbered on a golden cross, surrounded by broad rays of\ngold. The gold tissue, frayed at the folds, broke out in little slender\ntufts; the embossed ornaments were getting tarnished and worn. There was\nperpetual anxiety, fluttering concern, at seeing it thus go off spangle\nby spangle. The priest had to wear it almost every day. And how on earth\ncould it be replaced--how would they be able to buy the three chasubles\nwhose place it took, when the last gold threads should be worn out?\n\nUpon the chasuble La Teuse next laid out the stole, the maniple, the\ngirdle, alb and amice. But her tongue still wagged while she crossed\nthe stole with the maniple, and wreathed the girdle so as to trace the\nvenerated initial of Mary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s holy name.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098That girdle is not up to much now,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she muttered; \u00e2\u0080\u0098you will have to\nmake up your mind to get another, your reverence. It wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be very\nhard; I could plait you one myself if I only had some hemp.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAbbe Mouret made no answer. He was dressing the chalice at a small\ntable. A large old silver-gilt chalice it was with a bronze base, which\nhe had just taken from the bottom of a deal cupboard, in which the\nsacred vessels and linen, the Holy Oils, the Missals, candlesticks, and\ncrosses were kept. Across the cup he laid a clean purificator, and on\nthis set the silver-gilt paten, with the host in it, which he covered\nwith a small lawn pall. As he was hiding the chalice by gathering\ntogether the folds in the veil of cloth of gold matching the chasuble,\nLa Teuse exclaimed:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Stop, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no corporal in the burse. Last night I took all the\ndirty purificators, palls, and corporals to wash them--separately, of\ncourse--not with the house-wash. By-the-bye, your reverence, I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\ntell you: I have just started the house-wash. A fine fat one it will be!\nBetter than the last.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen while the priest slipped a corporal into the burse and laid the\nlatter on the veil, she went on quickly:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098By-the-bye, I forgot! that gadabout Vincent hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come. Do you wish me\nto serve your mass, your reverence?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe young priest eyed her sternly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a sin,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she continued, with her genial smile. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I did\nserve a mass once, in Monsieur Caffin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time. I serve it better, too,\nthan ragamuffins who laugh like heathens at seeing a fly buzzing about\nthe church. True I may wear a cap, I may be sixty years old, and as\nround as a tub, but I have more respect for our Lord than those imps of\nboys whom I caught only the other day playing at leap-frog behind the\naltar.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe priest was still looking at her and shaking his head.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What a hole this village is!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she grumbled. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Not a hundred and fifty\npeople in it! There are days, like to-day, when you wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find a\nliving soul in Les Artaud. Even the babies in swaddling clothes are\ngone to the vineyards! And goodness knows what they do among such\nvines--vines that grow under the pebbles and look as dry as thistles! A\nperfect wilderness, three miles from any highway! Unless an angel comes\ndown to serve your mass, your reverence, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve only got me to help you,\non my honour! or one of Mademoiselle Desiree\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rabbits, no offence to\nyour reverence!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nJust at that moment, however, Vincent, the Brichets\u00e2\u0080\u0099 younger son, gently\nopened the door of the sacristy. His shock of red hair and his little,\nglistening, grey eyes exasperated La Teuse.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh! the wretch!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she cried. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll bet he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just been up to some\nmischief! Come on, you scamp, since his reverence is afraid I might\ndirty our Lord!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nOn seeing the lad, Abbe Mouret had taken up the amice. He kissed the\ncross embroidered in the centre of it, and for a second laid the cloth\nupon his head; then lowering it over the collar-band of his cassock, he\ncrossed it and fastened the tapes, the right one over the left. He next\ndonned the alb, the symbol of purity, beginning with the right sleeve.\nVincent stooped and turned around him, adjusting the alb, in order\nthat it should fall evenly all round him to a couple of inches from\nthe ground. Then he presented the girdle to the priest, who fastened\nit tightly round his loins, as a reminder of the bonds wherewith the\nSaviour was bound in His Passion.\n\nLa Teuse remained standing there, feeling jealous and hurt and\nstruggling to keep silence; but so great was the itching of her tongue,\nthat she soon broke out once more: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Brother Archangias has been here.\nHe won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a single child at school to-day. He went off again like a\nwhirlwind to pull the brats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ears in the vineyards. You had better see\nhim. I believe he has got something to say to you.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAbbe Mouret silenced her with a wave of the hand. Then he repeated the\nusual prayers while he took the maniple--which he kissed before slipping\nit over his left forearm, as a symbol of the practice of good works--and\nwhile crossing on his breast the stole, the symbol of his dignity\nand power. La Teuse had to help Vincent in the work of adjusting the\nchasuble, which she fastened together with slender tapes, so that it\nmight not slip off behind.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Holy Virgin! I had forgotten the cruets!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she stammered, rushing to the\ncupboard. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Come, look sharp, lad!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThereupon Vincent filled the cruets, phials of coarse glass, while\nshe hastened to take a clean finger-cloth from a drawer. Abbe Mouret,\nholding the chalice by its stem with his left hand, the fingers of his\nright resting meanwhile on the burse, then bowed profoundly, but without\nremoving his biretta, to a black wooden crucifix, which hung over the\nside-board. The lad bowed too, and, bearing the cruets covered with the\nfinger-cloth, led the way out of the sacristy, followed by the priest,\nwho walked on with downcast eyes, absorbed in deep and prayerful\nmeditation.\n\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nThe empty church was quite white that May morning. The bell-rope near\nthe confessional hung motionless once more. The little bracket light,\nwith its stained glass shade, burned like a crimson splotch against the\nwall on the right of the tabernacle. Vincent, having set the cruets on\nthe credence, came back and knelt just below the altar step on the left,\nwhile the priest, after rendering homage to the Holy Sacrament by a\ngenuflexion, went up to the altar and there spread out the corporal,\non the centre of which he placed the chalice. Then, having opened the\nMissal, he came down again. Another bend of the knee followed, and,\nafter crossing himself and uttering aloud the formula, \u00e2\u0080\u0098In the name of\nthe Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he raised his joined hands to\nhis breast, and entered on the great divine drama, with his countenance\nblanched by faith and love.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098_Introibo ad altare Dei_.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098_Ad Deum qui loetificat juventutem meam_,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 gabbled Vincent, who,\nsquatting on his heels, mumbled the responses of the antiphon and the\npsalm, while watching La Teuse as she roved about the church.\n\nThe old servant was gazing at one of the candles with a troubled look.\nHer anxiety seemed to increase while the priest, bowing down with hands\njoined again, recited the _Confiteor_. She stood still, in her turn\nstruck her breast, her head bowed, but still keeping a watchful eye on\nthe taper. For another minute the priest\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grave voice and the server\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nstammers alternated:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098_Dominus vobiscum_.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098_Et cum spiritu tuo_.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen the priest, spreading out his hands and afterwards again joining\nthem, said with devout compunction: \u00e2\u0080\u0098_Oremus_\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (Let us pray).\n\nLa Teuse could now stand it no longer, but stepped behind the altar,\nreached the guttering candle, and trimmed it with the points of her\nscissors. Two large blobs of wax had already been wasted. When she came\nback again putting the benches straight on her way, and making sure that\nthere was holy-water in the fonts, the priest, whose hands were resting\non the edge of the altar-cloth, was praying in subdued tones. And at\nlast he kissed the altar.\n\nBehind him, the little church still looked wan in the pale light of\nearly morn. The sun, as yet, was only level with the tiled roof. The\n_Kyrie Eleisons_ rang quiveringly through that sort of whitewashed\nstable with flat ceiling and bedaubed beams. On either side three lofty\nwindows of plain glass, most of them cracked or smashed, let in a raw\nlight of chalky crudeness.\n\nThe free air poured in as it listed, emphasising the naked poverty of\nthe God of that forlorn village. At the far end of the church, above\nthe big door which was never opened and the threshold of which was\ngreen with weeds, a boarded gallery--reached by a common miller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nladder--stretched from wall to wall. Dire were its creakings on festival\ndays beneath the weight of wooden shoes. Near the ladder stood the\nconfessional, with warped panels, painted a lemon yellow. Facing it,\nbeside the little door, stood the font--a former holy-water stoup\nresting on a stonework pedestal. To the right and to the left, halfway\ndown the church, two narrow altars stood against the wall, surrounded\nby wooden balustrades. On the left-hand one, dedicated to the Blessed\nVirgin, was a large gilded plaster statue of the Mother of God, wearing\na regal gold crown upon her chestnut hair; while on her left arm sat\nthe Divine Child, nude and smiling, whose little hand raised the\nstar-spangled orb of the universe. The Virgin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feet were poised on\nclouds, and beneath them peeped the heads of winged cherubs. Then the\nright-hand altar, used for the masses for the dead, was surmounted by a\ncrucifix of painted papier-mache--a pendant, as it were, to the Virgin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\neffigy. The figure of Christ, as large as a child of ten years old,\nshowed Him in all the horror of His death-throes, with head thrown back,\nribs projecting, abdomen hollowed in, and limbs distorted and splashed\nwith blood. There was a pulpit, too--a square box reached by a five-step\nblock--near a clock with running weights, in a walnut case, whose thuds\nshook the whole church like the beatings of some huge heart concealed,\nit might be, under the stone flags. All along the nave the fourteen\nStations of the Cross, fourteen coarsely coloured prints in narrow black\nframes, bespeckled the staring whiteness of the walls with the yellow,\nblue, and scarlet of scenes from the Passion.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098_Deo Gratias_,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 stuttered out Vincent at the end of the Epistle.\n\nThe mystery of love, the immolation of the Holy Victim, was about\nto begin. The server took the Missal and bore it to the left, or\nGospel-side, of the altar, taking care not to touch the pages of the\nbook. Each time he passed before the tabernacle he made a genuflexion\nslantwise, which threw him all askew. Returning to the right-hand side\nonce more, he stood upright with crossed arms during the reading of the\nGospel. The priest, after making the sign of the cross upon the Missal,\nnext crossed himself: first upon his forehead--to declare that he\nwould never blush for the divine word; then on his mouth--to show his\nunchanging readiness to confess his faith; and finally on his heart--to\nmark that it belonged to God alone.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098_Dominus vobiscum_,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said he, turning round and facing the cold white\nchurch.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098_Et cum spiritu tuo_,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 answered Vincent, who once more was on his\nknees.\n\nThe Offertory having been recited, the priest uncovered the chalice. For\na moment he held before his breast the paten containing the host, which\nhe offered up to God, for himself, for those present, and for all the\nfaithful, living and dead. Then, slipping it on to the edge of the\ncorporal without touching it with his fingers, he took up the chalice\nand carefully wiped it with the purificator. Vincent had in the\nmeanwhile fetched the cruets from the credence table, and now presented\nthem in turn, first the wine and then the water. The priest then offered\nup on behalf of the whole world the half-filled chalice, which he next\nreplaced upon the corporal and covered with the pall. Then once again\nhe prayed, and returned to the side of the altar where the server let a\nlittle water dribble over his thumbs and forefingers to purify him\nfrom the slightest sinful stain. When he had dried his hands on\nthe finger-cloth, La Teuse--who stood there waiting--emptied the\ncruet-salver into a zinc pail at the corner of the altar.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098_Orate, fratres_,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 resumed the priest aloud as he faced the empty\nbenches, extending and reclasping his hands in a gesture of appeal to\nall men of good-will. And turning again towards the altar, he continued\nhis prayer in a lower tone, while Vincent began to mutter a long Latin\nsentence in which he eventually got lost. Now it was that the yellow\nsunbeams began to dart through the windows; called, as it were, by the\npriest, the sun itself had come to mass, throwing golden sheets of light\nupon the left-hand wall, the confessional, the Virgin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s altar, and the\nbig clock.\n\nA gentle creak came from the confessional; the Mother of God, in a halo,\nin the dazzlement of her golden crown and mantle smiled tenderly with\ntinted lips upon the infant Jesus; and the heated clock throbbed out\nthe time with quickening strokes. It seemed as if the sun peopled the\nbenches with the dusty motes that danced in his beams, as if the\nlittle church, that whitened stable, were filled with a glowing throng.\nWithout, were heard the sounds that told of the happy waking of the\ncountryside, the blades of grass sighed out content, the damp leaves\ndried themselves in the warmth, the birds pruned their feathers and took\na first flit round. And indeed the countryside itself seemed to enter\nwith the sun; for beside one of the windows a large rowan tree shot\nup, thrusting some of its branches through the shattered panes and\nstretching out leafy buds as if to take a peep within; while through\nthe fissures of the great door the weeds on the threshold threatened to\nencroach upon the nave. Amid all this quickening life, the big Christ,\nstill in shadow, alone displayed signs of death, the sufferings of\nochre-daubed and lake-bespattered flesh. A sparrow raised himself up for\na moment at the edge of a hole, took a glance, then flew away; but\nonly to reappear almost immediately when with noiseless wing he\ndropped between the benches before the Virgin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s altar. A second sparrow\nfollowed; and soon from all the boughs of the rowan tree came others\nthat calmly hopped about the flags.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098_Sanctus, Sanctus, Sanctus, Dominus Deus Sabaoth_,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the priest in\na low tone, whilst slightly stooping.\n\nVincent rang the little bell thrice; and the sparrows, scared by the\nsudden tinkling, flew off with such a mighty buzz of wings that La\nTeuse, who had just gone back into the sacristy, came out again,\ngrumbling; \u00e2\u0080\u0098The little rascals! they will mess everything. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll bet that\nMademoiselle Desiree has been here again to scatter bread-crumbs for\nthem.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe dread moment was at hand. The body and the blood of a God were about\nto descend upon the altar. The priest kissed the altar-cloth, clasped\nhis hands, and multiplied signs of the cross over host and chalice.\nThe prayers of the canon of the mass now fell from his lips in a very\necstasy of humility and gratitude. His attitude, his gestures, the\ninflections of his voice, all expressed his consciousness of his\nlittleness, his emotion at being selected for so great a task. Vincent\ncame and knelt beside him, lightly lifted the chasuble with his left\nhand, the bell ready in his right; and the priest, his elbows resting on\nthe edge of the altar, holding the host with the thumbs and forefingers\nof both hands, pronounced over it the words of consecration: _Hoc est\nenim corpus meum_. Then having bowed the knee before it, he raised it\nslowly as high as his hands could reach, following it upwards with\nhis eyes, while the kneeling server rang the bell thrice. Then he\nconsecrated the wine--_Hic est enim calix_--leaning once more upon his\nelbows, bowing, raising the cup aloft, his right hand round the stem,\nhis left holding its base, and his eyes following it aloft. Again the\nserver rang the bell three times. The great mystery of the Redemption\nhad once more been repeated, once more had the adorable Blood flowed\nforth.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Just you wait a bit,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 growled La Teuse, as she tried to scare away the\nsparrows with outstretched fist.\n\nBut the sparrows were now fearless. They had come back even while the\nbell was ringing, and, unabashed, were fluttering about the benches. The\nrepeated tinklings even roused them into liveliness, and they answered\nback with little chirps which crossed amid the Latin words of prayer,\nlike the rippling laughs of free urchins. The sun warmed their plumage,\nthe sweet poverty of the church captivated them. They felt at home\nthere, as in some barn whose shutters had been left open, and screeched,\nfought, and squabbled over the crumbs they found upon the floor. One\nflew to perch himself on the smiling Virgin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s golden veil; another,\nwhose daring put the old servant in a towering rage, made a hasty\nreconnaissance of La Teuse\u00e2\u0080\u0099s skirts. And at the altar, the priest, with\nevery faculty absorbed, his eyes fixed upon the sacred host, his thumbs\nand forefingers joined, did not even hear this invasion of the warm\nMay morning, this rising flood of sunlight, greenery and birds, which\noverflowed even to the foot of the Calvary where doomed nature was\nwrestling in the death-throes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098_Per omnia soecula soeculorum_,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Amen,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 answered Vincent.\n\nThe _Pater_ ended, the priest, holding the host over the chalice,\nbroke it in the centre. Detaching a particle from one of the halves, he\ndropped it into the precious blood, to symbolise the intimate union into\nwhich he was about to enter with God. He said the _Agnus Dei_ aloud,\nsoftly recited the three prescribed prayers, and made his act of\nunworthiness, and then with his elbows resting on the altar, and with\nthe paten beneath his chin, he partook of both portions of the host\nat once. After a fervent meditation, with his hands clasped before\nhis face, he took the paten and gathered from the corporal the sacred\nparticles of the host that had fallen, and dropped them into the\nchalice. One particle which had adhered to his thumb he removed with his\nforefinger. And, crossing himself, chalice in hand, with the paten once\nagain below his chin, he drank all the precious blood in three draughts,\nnever taking his lips from the cup\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rim, but imbibing the divine\nSacrifice to the last drop.\n\nVincent had risen to fetch the cruets from the credence table. But\nsuddenly the door of the passage leading to the parsonage flew open\nand swung back against the wall, to admit a handsome child-like girl of\ntwenty-two, who carried something hidden in her apron.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Thirteen of them,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she called out. \u00e2\u0080\u0098All the eggs were good.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And she\nopened out her apron and revealed a brood of little shivering chicks,\nwith sprouting down and beady black eyes. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Do just look,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said she;\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t they sweet little pets, the darlings! Oh, look at the little\nwhite one climbing on the others\u00e2\u0080\u0099 backs! and the spotted one already\nflapping his tiny wings! The eggs were a splendid lot; not one of them\nunfertile.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nLa Teuse, who was helping to serve the mass in spite of all\nprohibitions, and was at that very moment handing the cruets to Vincent\nfor the ablutions, thereupon turned round and loudly exclaimed: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Do be\nquiet, Mademoiselle Desiree! Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you see we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t finished yet?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThrough the open doorway now came the strong smell of a farmyard,\nblowing like some generative ferment into the church amidst the warm\nsunlight that was creeping over the altar. Desiree stood there for a\nmoment delighted with the little ones she carried, watching Vincent\npour, and her brother drink, the purifying wine, in order that nought of\nthe sacred elements should be left within his mouth. And she stood there\nstill when he came back to the side of the altar, holding the chalice in\nboth hands, so that Vincent might pour over his forefingers and thumbs\nthe wine and water of ablution, which he likewise drank. But when the\nmother hen ran up clucking with alarm to seek her little ones, and\nthreatened to force her way into the church, Desiree went off,\ntalking maternally to her chicks, while the priest, after pressing the\npurificator to his lips, wiped first the rim and next the interior of\nthe chalice.\n\nThen came the end, the act of thanksgiving to God. For the last time the\nserver removed the Missal, and brought it back to the right-hand side.\nThe priest replaced the purificator, paten, and pall upon the chalice;\nonce more pinched the two large folds of the veil together, and laid\nupon it the burse containing the corporal. His whole being was now one\nact of ardent thanksgiving. He besought from Heaven the forgiveness of\nhis sins, the grace of a holy life, and the reward of everlasting\nlife. He remained as if overwhelmed by this miracle of love, the\never-recurring immolation, which sustained him day by day with the blood\nand flesh of his Savior.\n\nHaving read the final prayers, he turned and said: \u00e2\u0080\u0098_Ite, missa est_.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098_Deo gratias_,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 answered Vincent.\n\nAnd having turned back to kiss the altar, the priest faced round anew,\nhis left hand just below his breast, his right outstretched whilst\nblessing the church, which the gladsome sunbeams and noisy sparrows\nfilled.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098_Benedicat vos omnipotens Deus, Pater et Filius, et Spiritus Sanctus_.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098_Amen_,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the server, as he crossed himself.\n\nThe sun had risen higher, and the sparrows were growing bolder. While\nthe priest read from the left-hand altar-card the passage of the Gospel\nof St. John, announcing the eternity of the Word, the sunrays set the\naltar ablaze, whitened the panels of imitation marble, and dimmed the\nflame of the two candles, whose short wicks were now merely two dull\nspots. The victorious orb enveloped with his glory the crucifix, the\ncandlesticks, the chasuble, the veil of the chalice--all the gold work\nthat paled beneath his beams. And when at last the priest, after taking\nthe chalice in his hands and making a genuflexion, covered his head and\nturned from the altar to follow the server, laden with the cruets and\nfinger-cloth, to the sacristy, the planet remained sole master of the\nchurch. Its rays in turn now rested on the altar-cloth, irradiating the\ntabernacle-door with splendour, and celebrating the fertile powers\nof May. Warmth rose from the stone flags. The daubed walls, the tall\nVirgin, the huge Christ, too, all seemed to quiver as with shooting sap,\nas if death had been conquered by the earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eternal youth.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nLe Teuse hastily put out the candles, but lingered to make one last\nattempt to drive away the sparrows, and so when she returned to the\nsacristy with the Missal she no longer found Abbe Mouret there. Having\nwashed his hands and put away the sacred vessels and vestments, he was\nnow standing in the dining room, breakfasting off a cup of milk.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You really ought to prevent your sister from scattering bread in the\nchurch,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said La Teuse on coming in. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It was last winter she hit upon\nthat pretty prank. She said the sparrows were cold, and that God might\nwell give them some food. You see, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll end by making us sleep with\nall her fowls and rabbits.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098We should be all the warmer,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 pleasantly replied the young priest. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You\nare always grumbling, La Teuse. Do let our poor Desiree pet her animals.\nShe has no other pleasure, poor innocent!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe servant took her stand in the centre of the room.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I do believe you yourself wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind a bit if the magpies actually\nbuilt their nests in the church. You never can see anything, everything\nseems just what it ought to be to you. Your sister is precious lucky\nin having had you to take charge of her when you left the seminary. No\nfather, no mother. I should like to know who would let her mess about as\nshe does in a farmyard.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen softening, she added in a gentler tone: \u00e2\u0080\u0098To be sure, it would be\na pity to cross her. She hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a touch of malice in her. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like\na child of ten, although she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of the finest grown girls in the\nneighbourhood. And I have to put her to bed, as you know, every night,\nand send her to sleep with stories, just like a little child.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAbbe Mouret had remained standing, finishing the cup of milk he\nheld between his fingers, which were slightly reddened by the chill\natmosphere of the dining-room--a large room with painted grey walls, a\nfloor of square tiles, and having no furniture beyond a table and a few\nchairs. La Teuse picked up a napkin which she had laid at a corner of\nthe table in readiness for breakfast.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t much linen you dirty,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she muttered. \u00e2\u0080\u0098One would think you\ncould never sit down, that you are always just about to start off. Ah!\nif you had known Monsieur Caffin, the poor dead priest whose place\nyou have taken! What a man he was for comfort! Why, he couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have\ndigested his food, if he had eaten standing. A Norman he was, from\nCanteleu, like myself. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t thank him, I tell you, for having brought\nme to such a wild-beast country as this. When first we came, O, Lord!\nhow bored we were! But the poor priest had had some uncomfortable tales\ngoing about him at home.... Why, sir, didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you sweeten your milk,\nthen? Aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t those the two lumps of sugar?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe priest put down his cup.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes, I must have forgotten, I believe,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said.\n\nLa Teuse stared at him and shrugged her shoulders. She folded up inside\nthe napkin a slice of stale home-made bread which had also been left\nuntouched on the table. Then just as the priest was about to go out,\nshe ran after him and knelt down at his feet, exclaiming: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Stop, your\nshoe-laces are not even fastened. I cannot imagine how your feet can\nstand those peasant shoes, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re such a little, tender man and look as\nif you had been preciously spoilt! Ah, the bishop must have known a deal\nabout you, to go and give you the poorest living in the department.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But it was I who chose Les Artaud,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the priest, breaking into\nanother smile. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You are very bad-tempered this morning, La Teuse. Are we\nnot happy here? We have got all we want, and our life is as peaceful as\nif in paradise.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe then restrained herself and laughed in her turn, saying: \u00e2\u0080\u0098You are a\nholy man, Monsieur le Cure. But come and see what a splendid wash I have\ngot. That will be better than squabbling with one another.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe priest was obliged to follow, for she might prevent him going out\nat all if he did not compliment her on her washing. As he left the\ndining-room he stumbled over a heap of rubbish in the passage.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What is this?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he asked.\n\nOh, nothing,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said La Teuse in her grimest tone. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only the\nparsonage coming down. However, you are quite content, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got all\nyou want. Good heavens! there are holes and to spare. Just look at that\nceiling, now. Isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it cracked all over? If we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get buried alive\none of these days, we shall owe a precious big taper to our guardian\nangel. However, if it suits you--It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like the church. Those broken\npanes ought to have been replaced these two years. In winter our Lord\ngets frozen with the cold. Besides, it would keep out those rascally\nsparrows. I shall paste paper over the holes. You see if I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098A capital idea,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 murmured the priest, \u00e2\u0080\u0098they might very well be pasted\nover. As to the walls, they are stouter than we think. In my room, the\nfloor has only given way slightly in front of the window. The house will\nsee us all buried.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nOn reaching the little open shed near the kitchen, in order to please\nLa Teuse he went into ecstasies over the washing; he even had to dip\nhis fingers into it and feel it. This so pleased the old woman that\nher attentions became quite motherly. She no longer scolded, but ran\nto fetch a clothes-brush, saying: \u00e2\u0080\u0098You surely are not going out with\nyesterday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mud on your cassock! If you had left it out on the banister,\nit would be clean now--it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still a good one. But do lift it up well\nwhen you cross any field. The thistles tear everything.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nWhile speaking she kept turning him round like a child, shaking him from\nhead to foot with her energetic brushing.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There, there, that will do,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said, escaping from her at last. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Take\ncare of Desiree, won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you? I will tell her I am going out.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut at this minute a fresh clear voice called to him: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Serge! Serge!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nDesiree came flying up, her cheeks ruddy with glee, her head bare,\nher black locks twisted tightly upon her neck, and her hands and arms\nsmothered up to the elbows with manure. She had been cleaning out her\npoultry house. When she caught sight of her brother just about to go out\nwith his breviary under his arm, she laughed aloud, and kissed him on\nhis mouth, with her arms thrown back behind her to avoid soiling him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No, no,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she hurriedly exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I should dirty you. Oh! I am having\nsuch fun! You must see the animals when you come back.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThereupon she fled away again. Abbe Mouret then said that he would be\nback about eleven for luncheon, and as he started, La Teuse, who had\nfollowed him to the doorstep, shouted after him her last injunctions.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t forget to see Brother Archangias. And look in also at the\nBrichets\u00e2\u0080\u0099; the wife came again yesterday about that wedding. Just\nlisten, Monsieur le Cure! I met their Rosalie. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099d ask nothing better\nthan to marry big Fortune. Have a talk with old Bambousse; perhaps he\nwill listen to you now. And don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come back at twelve o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, like the\nother day. Come, say you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be back at eleven, won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut the priest turned round no more. So she went in again, growling\nbetween her teeth:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098When does he ever listen to me? Barely twenty-six years old and does\njust as he likes. To be sure, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an old man of sixty for holiness; but\nthen he has never known life; he knows nothing, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no trouble to him\nto be as good as a cherub!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nWhen Abbe Mouret had got beyond all hearing of La Teuse he stopped,\nthankful to be alone at last. The church was built on a hillock, which\nsloped down gently to the village. With its large gaping windows and\nbright red tiles, it stretched out like a deserted sheep-cote. The\npriest turned round and glanced at the parsonage, a greyish building\nspringing from the very side of the church; but as if fearful that\nhe might again be overtaken by the interminable chatter that had been\nbuzzing in his ears ever since morning, he turned up to the right again,\nand only felt safe when he at last stood before the great doorway, where\nhe could not be seen from the parsonage. The front of the church, quite\nbare and worn by the sunshine and rain of years, was crowned by a narrow\nopen stone belfry, in which a small bell showed its black silhouette,\nwhilst its rope disappeared through the tiles. Six broken steps, on\none side half buried in the earth, led up to the lofty arched door, now\ncracked, smothered with dust and rust and cobwebs, and so frailly hung\nupon its outwrenched hinges that it seemed as if the first slight puff\nwould secure free entrance to the winds of heaven. Abbe Mouret, who had\nan affection for this dilapidated door, leaned against one of its leaves\nas he stood upon the steps. Thence he could survey the whole country\nround at a glance. And shading his eyes with his hands he scanned the\nhorizon.\n\nIn the month of May exuberant vegetation burst forth from that stony\nsoil. Gigantic lavenders, juniper bushes, patches of rank herbage\nswarmed over the church threshold, and scattered clumps of dark greenery\neven to the very tiles. It seemed as if the first throb of shooting sap\nin the tough matted underwood might well topple the church over. At that\nearly hour, amid all the travail of nature\u00e2\u0080\u0099s growth, there was a hum of\nvivifying warmth, and the very rocks quivered as with a long and silent\neffort. But the Abbe failed to comprehend the ardour of nature\u00e2\u0080\u0099s painful\nlabour; he simply thought that the steps were tottering, and thereupon\nleant against the other side of the door.\n\nThe countryside stretched away for a distance of six miles, bounded by\na wall of tawny hills speckled with black pine-woods. It was a fearful\nlandscape of arid wastes and rocky spurs rending the soil. The few\npatches of arable ground were like scattered pools of blood, red fields\nwith rows of lean almond trees, grey-topped olive trees and long lines\nof vines, streaking the soil with their brown stems. It was as if some\nhuge conflagration had swept by there, scattering the ashes of forests\nover the hill-tops, consuming all the grass of the meadow lands, and\nleaving its glare and furnace-like heat behind in the hollows. Only here\nand there was the softer note of a pale green patch of growing corn. The\nlandscape generally was wild, lacking even a threadlet of water, dying\nof thirst, and flying away in clouds of dust at the least breath of\nwind. But at the farthest point where the crumbling hills on the horizon\nhad left a breach one espied some distant fresh moist greenery, a\nstretch of the neighbouring valley fertilised by the Viorne, a river\nflowing down from the gorges of the Seille.\n\nThe priest lowered his dazzled glance upon the village, whose few\nscattered houses straggled away below the church--wretched hovels they\nwere of rubble and boards strewn along a narrow path without sign of\nstreets. There were about thirty of them altogether, some squatting\namidst muck-heaps, and black with woeful want; others roomier and more\ncheerful-looking with their roofs of pinkish tiles. Strips of garden,\nvictoriously planted amidst stony soil, displayed plots of vegetables\nenclosed by quickset hedges. At this hour Les Artaud was empty, not a\nwoman was at the windows, not a child was wallowing in the dust; parties\nof fowls alone went to and fro, ferreting among the straw, seeking food\nup to the very thresholds of the houses, whose open doors gaped in the\nsunlight. A big black dog seated on his haunches at the entrance to the\nvillage seemed to be mounting guard over it.\n\nLanguor slowly stole over Abbe Mouret. The rising sun steeped him in\nsuch warmth that he leant back against the church door pervaded by a\nfeeling of happy restfulness. His thoughts were dwelling on that hamlet\nof Les Artaud, which had sprung up there among the stones like one of\nthe knotty growths of the valley. All its inhabitants were related,\nall bore the same name, so that from their very cradle they were\ndistinguished among themselves by nicknames. An Artaud, their ancestor,\nhad come hither and settled like a pariah in this waste. His family had\ngrown with all the wild vitality of the herbage that sucked life from\nthe rocky boulders. It had at last become a tribe, a rural community,\nin which cousin-ships were lost in the mists of centuries. They\nintermarried with shameless promiscuity. Not an instance could be cited\nof any Artaud taking himself a wife from any neighbouring village; only\nsome of the girls occasionally went elsewhere. The others were born and\ndied fixed to that spot, leisurely increasing and multiplying on their\ndunghills with the irreflectiveness of trees, and with no definite\nnotion of the world that lay beyond the tawny rocks, in whose midst they\nvegetated. And yet there were already rich and poor among them; fowls\nhaving at times disappeared, the fowl-houses were now closed at night\nwith stout padlocks; moreover one Artaud had killed another Artaud one\nevening behind the mill. These folk, begirt by that belt of desolate\nhills, were truly a people apart--a race sprung from the soil, a\nminiature replica of mankind, three hundred souls all told, beginning\nthe centuries yet once again.\n\nOver the priest the sombre shadows of seminary life still hovered. For\nyears he had never seen the sun. He perceived it not even now, his\neyes closed and gazing inwards on his soul, and with no feeling for\nperishable nature, fated to damnation, save contempt. For a long time\nin his hours of devout thought he had dreamt of some hermit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s desert,\nof some mountain hole, where no living thing--neither being, plant,\nnor water--should distract him from the contemplation of God. It was an\nimpulse springing from the purest love, from a loathing of all physical\nsensation. There, dying to self, and with his back turned to the light\nof day, he would have waited till he should cease to be, till nothing\nshould remain of him but the sovereign whiteness of the soul. To him\nheaven seemed all white, with a luminous whiteness as if lilies there\nsnowed down upon one, as if every form of purity, innocence, and\nchastity there blazed. But his confessor reproved him whenever he\nrelated his longings for solitude, his cravings for an existence of\nGodlike purity; and recalled him to the struggles of the Church, the\nnecessary duties of the priesthood. Later on, after his ordination, the\nyoung priest had come to Les Artaud at his own request, there hoping to\nrealise his dream of human annihilation. In that desolate spot, on that\nbarren soil, he might shut his ears to all worldly sounds, and live the\ndreamy life of a saint. For some months past, in truth, his existence\nhad been wholly undisturbed, rarely had any thrill of the village-life\ndisturbed him; and even the sun\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heat scarcely brought him any glow\nof feeling as he walked the paths, his whole being wrapped in heaven,\nheedless of the unceasing travail of life amidst which he moved.\n\nThe big black dog watching over Les Artaud had determined to come up to\nAbbe Mouret, and now sat upon its haunches at the priest\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feet; but the\nunconscious man remained absorbed amidst the sweetness of the morning.\nOn the previous evening he had begun the exercises of the Rosary, and\nto the intercession of the Virgin with her Divine Son he attributed the\ngreat joy which filled his soul. How despicable appeared all the good\nthings of the earth! How thankfully he recognised his poverty! When he\nentered into holy orders, after losing on the same day both his father\nand his mother through a tragedy the fearful details of which were even\nnow unknown to him,* he had relinquished all his share of their property\nto an elder brother. His only remaining link with the world was\nhis sister; he had undertaken the care of her, stirred by a kind of\nreligious affection for her feeble intelligence. The dear innocent was\nso childish, such a very little girl, that she recalled to him the poor\nin spirit to whom the Gospel promises the kingdom of heaven. Of late,\nhowever, she had somewhat disturbed him; she was growing too lusty, too\nfull of health and life. But his discomfort was yet of the slightest.\nHis days were spent in that inner life he had created for himself, for\nwhich he had relinquished all else. He closed the portals of his senses,\nand sought to free himself from all bodily needs, so that he might be\nbut a soul enrapt in contemplation. To him nature offered only snares\nand abominations; he gloried in maltreating her, in despising her, in\nreleasing himself from his human slime. And as the just man must be\na fool according to the world, he considered himself an exile on this\nearth; his thoughts were solely fixed upon the favours of Heaven,\nincapable as he was of understanding how an eternity of bliss could be\nweighed against a few hours of perishable enjoyment. His reason\nduped him and his senses lied; and if he advanced in virtue it was\nparticularly by humility and obedience. His wish was to be the last of\nall, one subject to all, in order that the divine dew might fall upon\nhis heart as upon arid sand; he considered himself overwhelmed with\nreproach and with confusion, unworthy of ever being saved from sin. He\nno longer belonged to himself--blind, deaf, dead to the world as he was.\nHe was God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thing. And from the depth of the abjectness to which he\nsought to plunge, Hosannahs suddenly bore him aloft, above the happy and\nthe mighty into the splendour of never-ending bliss.\n\n  * This forms the subject of M. Zola\u00e2\u0080\u0099s novel, _The Conquest of\n    Plassans_. ED.\n\nThus, at Les Artaud, Abbe Mouret had once more experienced, each time he\nread the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Imitation,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the raptures of the cloistered life which he had\nlonged for at one time so ardently. As yet he had not had to fight\nany battle. From the moment that he knelt down, he became perfect,\nabsolutely oblivious of the flesh, unresisting, undisturbed, as if\noverpowered by the Divine grace. Such ecstasy at God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approach is well\nknown to some young priests: it is a blissful moment when all is hushed,\nand the only desire is but a boundless craving for purity. From no human\ncreature had he sought his consolations. He who believes a certain thing\nto be all in all cannot be troubled: and he did believe that God was all\nin all, and that humility, obedience, and chastity were everything.\nHe could remember having heard temptation spoken of as an abominable\ntorture that tries the holiest. But he would only smile: God had\nnever left him. He bore his faith about him thus like a breast-plate\nprotecting him from the slightest breath of evil. He could recall how\nhe had hidden himself and wept for very love; he knew not whom he loved,\nbut he wept for love, for love of some one afar off. The recollection\nnever failed to move him. Later on he had decided on becoming a priest\nin order to satisfy that craving for a superhuman affection which was\nhis sole torment. He could not see where greater love could be. In that\nstate of life he satisfied his being, his inherited predisposition, his\nyouthful dreams, his first virile desires. If temptation must come, he\nawaited it with the calmness of the seminarist ignorant of the world. He\nfelt that his manhood had been killed in him: it gladdened him to feel\nhimself a creature set apart, unsexed, turned from the usual paths of\nlife, and, as became a lamb of the Lord, marked with the tonsure.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nWhile the priest pondered the sun was heating the big church-door.\nGilded flies buzzed round a large flower that was blooming between two\nof the church-door steps. Abbe Mouret, feeling slightly dazed, was\nat last about to move away, when the big black dog sprang, barking\nviolently, towards the iron gate of the little graveyard on the left of\nthe church. At the same time a harsh voice called out: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! you young\nrascal! So you stop away from school, and I find you in the graveyard!\nOh, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say no: I have been watching you this quarter of an hour.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAs the priest stepped forward he saw Vincent, whom a Brother of\nthe Christian Schools was clutching tightly by the ear. The lad was\nsuspended, as it were, over a ravine skirting the graveyard, at the\nbottom of which flowed the Mascle, a mountain torrent whose crystal\nwaters plunged into the Viorne, six miles away.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Brother Archangias!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 softly called the priest, as if to appease the\nfearful man.\n\nThe Brother, however, did not release the boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ear.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s you, Monsieur le Cure?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he growled. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Just fancy, this rascal\nis always poking his nose into the graveyard. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what he can\nbe up to here. I ought to let go of him and let him smash his skull down\nthere. It would be what he deserves.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe lad remained dumb, with his cunning eyes tight shut as he clung to\nthe bushes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Take care, Brother Archangias,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 continued the priest, \u00e2\u0080\u0098he might slip.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAnd he himself helped Vincent to scramble up again.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Come, my young friend, what were you doing there?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he asked. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You must\nnot go playing in graveyards.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe lad had opened his eyes, and crept away, fearfully, from the\nBrother, to place himself under the priest\u00e2\u0080\u0099s protection.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell you,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said in a low voice, as he raised his bushy head.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There is a tomtit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nest in the brambles there, under that rock.\nFor over ten days I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been watching it, and now the little ones are\nhatched, so I came this morning after serving your mass.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098A tomtit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nest!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed Brother Archangias. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Wait a bit! wait a\nbit!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThereupon he stepped aside, picked a clod of earth off a grave and flung\nit into the brambles. But he missed the nest. Another clod, however,\nmore skilfully thrown upset the frail cradle, and precipitated the\nfledglings into the torrent below.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Now, perhaps,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he continued, clapping his hands to shake off the earth\nthat soiled them, \u00e2\u0080\u0098you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come roaming here any more, like a heathen;\nthe dead will pull your feet at night if you go walking over them\nagain.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nVincent, who had laughed at seeing the nest dive into the stream, looked\nround him and shrugged his shoulders like one of strong mind.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not afraid,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Dead folk don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stir.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe graveyard, in truth, was not a place to inspire fear. It was a\nbarren piece of ground whose narrow paths were smothered by rank weeds.\nHere and there the soil was bossy with mounds. A single tombstone, that\nof Abbe Caffin, brand-new and upright, could be perceived in the centre\nof the ground. Save this, all around there were only broken fragments\nof crosses, withered tufts of box, and old slabs split and moss-eaten.\nThere were not two burials a year. Death seemed to make no dwelling in\nthat waste spot, whither La Teuse came every evening to fill her apron\nwith grass for Desiree\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rabbits. A gigantic cypress tree, standing\nnear the gate, alone cast shadow upon the desert field. This cypress,\na landmark visible for nine miles around, was known to the whole\ncountryside as the Solitaire.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s full of lizards,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 added Vincent, looking at the cracks of the\nchurch-wall. \u00e2\u0080\u0098One could have a fine lark--\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut he sprang out with a bound on seeing the Brother lift his foot. The\nlatter proceeded to call the priest\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attention to the dilapidated state\nof the gate, which was not only eaten up with rust, but had one hinge\noff, and the lock broken.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It ought to be repaired,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said he.\n\nAbbe Mouret smiled, but made no reply. Addressing Vincent, who was\nromping with the dog: \u00e2\u0080\u0098I say, my boy,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he asked, \u00e2\u0080\u0098do you know where old\nBambousse is at work this morning?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe lad glanced towards the horizon. \u00e2\u0080\u0098He must be at his Olivettes field\nnow,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he answered, pointing towards the left. \u00e2\u0080\u0098But Voriau will show\nyour reverence the way. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sure to know where his master is.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And he\nclapped his hands and called: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Hie! Voriau! hie!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe big black dog paused a moment, wagging his tail, and seeking to read\nthe urchin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes. Then, barking joyfully, he set off down the slope to\nthe village. Abbe Mouret and Brother Archangias followed him, chatting.\nA hundred yards further Vincent surreptitiously bolted, and again glided\nup towards the church, keeping a watchful eye upon them, and ready\nto dart behind a bush if they should look round. With adder-like\nsuppleness, he once more glided into the graveyard, that paradise full\nof lizards, nests, and flowers.\n\nMeantime, while Voriau led the way before them along the dusty road,\nBrother Archangias was angrily saying to the priest: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Let be! Monsieur\nle Cure, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re spawn of damnation, those toads are! They ought to\nhave their backs broken, to make them pleasing to God. They grow up in\nirreligion, like their fathers. Fifteen years have I been here, and\nnot one Christian have I been able to turn out. The minute they quit\nmy hands, good-bye! They think of nothing but their land, their vines,\ntheir olive-trees. Not one ever sets foot in church. Brute beasts they\nare, struggling with their stony fields! Guide them with the stick,\nMonsieur le Cure, yes, the stick!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen, after drawing breath, he added with a terrific wave of his hands:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Those Artauds, look you, are like the brambles over-running these\nrocks. One stem has been enough to poison the whole district. They cling\non, they multiply, they live in spite of everything. Nothing short of\nfire from heaven, as at Gomorrha, will clear it all away.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098We should never despair of sinners,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Abbe Mouret, all inward\npeacefulness, as he leisurely walked on.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But these are the devil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 broke in the Brother still more\nviolently. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been a peasant, too. Up to eighteen I dug the earth;\nand later on, when I was at the Training College, I had to sweep, pare\nvegetables, do all the heavy work. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not their toilsome labour I find\nfault with. On the contrary, for God prefers the lowly. But the Artauds\nlive like beasts! They are like their dogs, they never attend mass, and\nmake a mock of the commandments of God and of the Church. They think of\nnothing but their plots of lands, so sweet they are on them!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nVoriau, his tail wagging, kept stopping and moving on again as soon as\nhe saw that they still followed him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There certainly are some grievous things going on,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Abbe Mouret.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098My predecessor, Abbe Caffin--\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098A poor specimen,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 interrupted the Brother. \u00e2\u0080\u0098He came here to us from\nNormandy owing to some disreputable affair. Once here, his sole thought\nwas good living; he let everything go to rack and ruin.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh, no, Abbe Caffin certainly did what he could; but I must own\nthat his efforts were all but barren in results. My own are mostly\nfruitless.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBrother Archangias shrugged his shoulders. He walked on for a minute\nin silence, swaying his tall bony frame, which looked as if it had\nbeen roughly fashioned with a hatchet. The sun beat down upon his neck,\nshadowing his hard, sword-edged peasant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Listen to me, Monsieur le Cure,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said at last. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I am too much\nbeneath you to lecture you; but still, I am almost double your age, I\nknow this part, and therefore I feel justified in telling you that you\nwill gain nothing by gentleness. The catechism, understand, is enough.\nGod has no mercy on the wicked. He burns them. Stick to that.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen, as Abbe Mouret, whose head remained bowed, did not open his mouth,\nhe went on: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Religion is leaving the country districts because it\nis made over indulgent. It was respected when it spoke out like an\nunforgiving mistress. I really don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what they can teach you now\nin the seminaries. The new priests weep like children with their\nparishioners. God no longer seems the same. I dare say, Monsieur le\nCure, that you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even know your catechism by heart now?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut the priest, wounded by the imperiousness with which the Brother so\nroughly sought to dominate him, looked up and dryly rejoined:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098That will do, your zeal is very praiseworthy. But haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you something\nto tell me? You came to the parsonage this morning, did you not?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThereupon Brother Archangias plumply answered: \u00e2\u0080\u0098I had to tell you just\nwhat I have told you. The Artauds live like pigs. Only yesterday I\nlearned that Rosalie, old Bambousse\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eldest daughter, is in the family\nway. It happens with all of them before they get married. And they\nsimply laugh at reproaches, as you know.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 murmured Abbe Mouret, \u00e2\u0080\u0098it is a great scandal. I am just on my way\nto see old Bambousse to speak to him about it; it is desirable that they\nshould be married as soon as possible. The child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father, it seems, is\nFortune, the Brichets\u00e2\u0080\u0099 eldest son. Unfortunately the Brichets are poor.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098That Rosalie, now,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 continued the Brother, \u00e2\u0080\u0098is just eighteen. Not four\nyears since I still had her under me at school, and she was already a\ngadabout. I have now got her sister Catherine, a chit of eleven, who\nseems likely to become even worse than her elder. One comes across her\nin every corner with that little scamp, Vincent. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no good, you may\npull their ears till they bleed, the woman always crops up in them.\nThey carry perdition about with them and are only fit to be thrown on a\nmuck-heap. What a splendid riddance if all girls were strangled at their\nbirth!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHis loathing, his hatred of woman made him swear like a carter. Abbe\nMouret, who had been listening to him with unmoved countenance, smiled\nat last at his rabid utterances. He called Voriau, who had strayed into\na field close by.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There, look there!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cried Brother Archangias, pointing to a group of\nchildren playing at the bottom of a ravine, \u00e2\u0080\u0098there are my young devils,\nwho play the truant under pretence of going to help their parents among\nthe vines! You may be certain that jade of a Catherine is among them....\nThere, didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t I tell you! Till to-night, Monsieur le Cure. Oh, just you\nwait, you rascals!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nOff he went at a run, his dirty neckband flying over his shoulder, and\nhis big greasy cassock tearing up the thistles. Abbe Mouret watched him\nswoop down into the midst of the children, who scattered like frightened\nsparrows. But he succeeded in seizing Catherine and one boy by the ears\nand led them back towards the village, clutching them tightly with his\nbig hairy fingers, and overwhelming them with abuse.\n\nThe priest walked on again. Brother Archangias sometimes aroused strange\nscruples in his mind. With his vulgarity and coarseness the Brother\nseemed to him the true man of God, free from earthly ties, submissive in\nall to Heaven\u00e2\u0080\u0099s will, humble, blunt, ready to shower abuse upon sin. He,\nthe priest, would then feel despair at his inability to rid himself\nmore completely of his body; he regretted that he was not ugly, unclean,\ncovered with vermin like some of the saints. Whenever the Brother had\nwounded him by some words of excessive coarseness, or by some over-hasty\nchurlishness, he would blame himself for his refinement, his innate\nshrinking, as if these were really faults. Ought he not to be dead to\nall the weaknesses of this world? And this time also he smiled sadly as\nhe thought how near he had been to losing his temper at the Brother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nroughly put lesson. It was pride, it seemed to him, seeking to work his\nperdition by making him despise the lowly. However, in spite of himself,\nhe felt relieved at being alone again, at being able to walk on gently,\nreading his breviary, free at last from the grating voice that had\ndisturbed his dream of heavenly love.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\nThe road wound on between fallen rocks, among which the peasants had\nsucceeded here and there in reclaiming six or seven yards of chalky\nsoil, planted with old olive trees. Under the priest\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feet the dust in\nthe deep ruts crackled lightly like snow. At times, as he felt a warmer\npuff upon his face, he would raise his eyes from his book, as if to seek\nwhence came this soft caress; but his gaze was vacant, straying without\nperception over the glowing horizon, over the twisted outlines of that\npassion-breathing landscape as it stretched out in the sun before him,\ndry, barren, despairing of the fertilisation for which it longed. And\nhe would lower his hat over his forehead to protect himself against\nthe warm breeze and tranquilly resume his reading, his cassock raising\nbehind him a cloudlet of dust which rolled along the surface of the\nroad.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Good morning, Monsieur le Cure,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 a passing peasant said to him.\n\nSounds of digging alongside the cultivated strips of ground again\nroused him from his abstraction. He turned his head and perceived big\nknotty-limbed old men greeting him from among the vines. The Artauds\nwere eagerly satisfying their passion for the soil, in the sun\u00e2\u0080\u0099s full\nblaze. Sweating brows appeared from behind the bushes, heaving chests\nwere slowly raised, the whole scene was one of ardent fructification,\nthrough which he moved with the calm step born of ignorance. No\ndiscomfort came to him from the great travail of love that permeated\nthat splendid morning.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Steady! Voriau, you mustn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t eat people!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 some one gaily shouted in a\npowerful voice by way of silencing the dog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s loud barks.\n\nAbbe Mouret looked up.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh! it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s you. Fortune?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said, approaching the edge of the field in\nwhich the young peasant was at work. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I was just on my way to speak to\nyou.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nFortune was of the same age as the priest: a bigly built, bold-looking\nyoung fellow, with skin already hardened. He was clearing a small plot\nof stony heath.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What about, Monsieur le Cure?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098About Rosalie and you,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied the priest.\n\nFortune began to laugh. Perhaps he thought it droll that a priest should\ninterest himself in such a matter.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he muttered, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not to blame in it nor she either. So much the\nworse if old Bambousse refuses to let me have her. You saw yourself how\nhis dog was trying to bite me just now; he sets him on me.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen, as Abbe Mouret was about to continue, old Artaud, called Brichet,\nwhom he had not previously perceived, emerged from the shadow of a bush\nbehind which he and his wife were eating. He was a little man, withered\nby age, with a cringing face.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Your reverence must have been told a pack of lies,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he exclaimed.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The youngster is quite ready to marry Rosalie. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happened isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nanybody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fault. It has happened to others who got on all right just the\nsame. The matter doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t rest with us. You ought to speak to Bambousse.\nHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the one who looks down on us because he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got money.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes, we are very poor,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 whined his wife, a tall lachrymose woman, who\nalso rose to her feet. \u00e2\u0080\u0098We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve only this scrap of ground where the very\ndevil seems to have been hailing stones. Not a bite of bread from it,\neven. Without you, your reverence, life would be impossible.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBrichet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wife was the one solitary devotee of the village. Whenever she\nhad been to communion, she would hang about the parsonage, well knowing\nthat La Teuse always kept a couple of loaves for her from her last\nbaking. At times she was even able to carry off a rabbit or a fowl given\nher by Desiree.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no end to the scandals,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 continued the priest. \u00e2\u0080\u0098The marriage\nmust take place without delay.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh! at once! as soon as the others are agreeable,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the old woman,\nalarmed about her periodical presents. \u00e2\u0080\u0098What do you say, Brichet? we are\nnot such bad Christians as to go against his reverence?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nFortune sniggered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m quite ready,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098and so is Rosalie. I saw her yesterday\nat the back of the mill. We haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quarrelled. We stopped there to have\na bit of a laugh.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut Abbe Mouret interrupted him: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Very well, I am now going to speak to\nBambousse. He is over there, at Les Olivettes, I believe.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe priest was going off when the mother asked him what had become of\nher younger son Vincent, who had left in the early morning to serve\nmass. There was a lad now who badly needed his reverence\u00e2\u0080\u0099s admonitions.\nAnd she walked by the priest\u00e2\u0080\u0099s side for another hundred yards, bemoaning\nher poverty, the failure of the potato crop, the frost which had nipped\nthe olive trees, the hot weather which threatened to scorch up the\nscanty corn. Then, as she left him, she solemnly declared that her son\nFortune always said his prayers, both morning and evening.\n\nVoriau now ran on in front, and suddenly, at a turn in the road, he\nbolted across the fields. The priest then struck into a small path\nleading up a low hill. He was now at Les Olivettes, the most fertile\nspot in the neighbourhood, where the mayor of the commune, Artaud,\notherwise Bambousse, owned several fields of corn, olive plantations,\nand vines. The dog was now romping round the skirts of a tall brunette,\nwho burst into a loud laugh as she caught sight of the priest.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Is your father here, Rosalie?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the latter asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes, just across there,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said, pointing with her hand and still\nsmiling.\n\nLeaving the part of the field she had been weeding, she walked on before\nhim with the vigorous springiness of a hard-working woman, her head\nunshielded from the sun, her neck all sunburnt, her hair black and\ncoarse like a horse\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mane. Her green-stained hands exhaled the odour of\nthe weeds she had been pulling up.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Father,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she called out, \u00e2\u0080\u0098here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Monsieur le Cure asking for you.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAnd there she remained, bold, unblushing, with a sly smile still\nhovering over her features. Bambousse, a stout, sweating, round-faced\nman, left his work and gaily came towards the priest.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d take my oath you are going to speak to me about the repairs of\nthe church,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he exclaimed, as he clapped his earthy hands. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, then,\nMonsieur le Cure, I can only say no, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impossible. The commune hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\ngot the coin. If the Lord provides plaster and tiles, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll provide the\nworkmen.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAt this jest of his the unbelieving peasant burst into a loud guffaw,\nslapped his thighs, coughed, and almost choked himself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It was not for the church I came,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied the Abbe Mouret. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I wanted\nto speak to you about your daughter Rosalie.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Rosalie? What has she done to you, then?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 inquired Bambousse, his eyes\nblinking.\n\nThe girl was boldly staring at the young priest, scrutinising his white\nhands and slender, feminine neck, as if trying to make him redden.\nHe, however, bluntly and with unruffled countenance, as if speaking of\nsomething quite indifferent, continued:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You know what I mean, Bambousse. She must get married.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it, is it?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 muttered the old man, with a bantering look.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Many thanks for the message. The Brichets sent you, didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t they? Mother\nBrichet goes to mass, and so you give her a helping hand to marry her\nson--it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all very fine. But, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got nothing to do with that. It\ndoesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t suit me. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThereupon the astonished priest represented to him that the scandal\nmust be stopped, and that he ought to forgive Fortune, as the latter was\nwilling to make reparation for his transgression, and that, lastly, his\ndaughter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reputation demanded a speedy marriage.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ta, ta, ta,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied Bambousse, what a lot of words! I shall keep my\ndaughter, please understand it. All that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got nothing to do with me.\nThat Fortune is a beggarly pauper, without a brass farthing. What an\neasy job, if one could marry a girl like that! At that rate we should\nhave all the young things marrying off morning and night. Thank Heaven!\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not worried about Rosalie: everybody knows what has happened; but\nit makes no difference. She can marry any one she chooses in the\nneighbourhood.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But the child?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 interrupted the priest.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The child indeed! There\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be time enough to think of that when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nborn.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nRosalie, perceiving the turn the priest\u00e2\u0080\u0099s application was taking, now\nthought it proper to ram her fists into her eyes and whimper. And she\neven let herself fall upon the ground.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Shut up, will you, you hussy!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 howled her father in a rage. And he\nproceeded to revile her in the coarsest terms, which made her laugh\nsilently behind her clenched fists.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t shut up? won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you? Just wait a minute then, you jade!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\ncontinued old Bambousse. And thereupon he picked up a clod of earth and\nflung it at her. It burst upon her knot of hair, crumbling down her neck\nand smothering her in dust. Dizzy from the blow, she bounded to her feet\nand fled, sheltering her head between her hands. But Bambousse had time\nto fling two more clods at her, and if the first only grazed her left\nshoulder, the next caught her full on the base of the spine, with such\nforce that she fell upon her knees.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Bambousse!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cried the priest, as he wrenched from the peasant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand a\nnumber of stones which he had just picked up.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Let be, Monsieur le Cure,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the other. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It was only soft earth.\nI ought to have thrown these stones at her. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy to see that you\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know girls. Hard as nails, all of them. I might duck that one in\nthe well, I might break all her bones with a cudgel, and she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d still be\njust the same. But I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got my eye on her, and if I catch her!... Ah!\nwell, they are all like that.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe was already comforted. He took a good pull at a big flat bottle of\nwine, encased in wicker-work, which lay warming on the hot ground.\nAnd breaking once more into a laugh, he said: \u00e2\u0080\u0098If I only had a glass,\nMonsieur le Cure, I would offer you some with pleasure.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098So then,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 again asked the priest, \u00e2\u0080\u0098this marriage?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No, it can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be; I should get laughed at. Rosalie is a stout wench.\nShe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth a man to me. I shall have to hire a lad the day she goes\noff.... We can have another talk about it after the vintage. Besides, I\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to be robbed. Give and take, say I. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fair. What do you\nthink?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nNevertheless for another long half-hour did the priest remain there\npreaching to Bambousse, speaking to him of God, and plying him with all\nthe reasons suited to the circumstances. But the old man had resumed\nhis work; he shrugged his shoulders, jested, and grew more and more\nobstinate. At last, he broke out: \u00e2\u0080\u0098But if you asked me for a sack of\ncorn, you would give me money, wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you? So why do you want me to\nlet my daughter go for nothing?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nMuch discomfited, Abbe Mouret left him. As he went down the path he saw\nRosalie rolling about under an olive tree with Voriau, who was licking\nher face. With her arms whirling, she kept on repeating: \u00e2\u0080\u0098You tickle me,\nyou big stupid. Leave off!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nWhen she perceived the priest, she made an attempt at a blush, settled\nher clothes, and once more raised her fists to her eyes. He, on his\npart, sought to console her by promising to attempt some fresh efforts\nwith her father, adding that, in the meantime, she should do nothing\nto aggravate her sin. And then, as she impudently smiled at him, he\npictured hell, where wicked women burn in torment. And afterwards he\nleft her, his duty done, his soul once more full of the serenity which\nenabled him to pass undisturbed athwart the corruptions of the world.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\nThe morning was becoming terribly hot. In that huge rocky amphitheatre\nthe sun kindled a furnace-like glare from the moment when the first\nfine weather began. By the planet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s height in the sky Abbe Mouret now\nperceived that he had only just time to return home if he wished to\nget there by eleven o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock and escape a scolding from La Teuse. Having\nfinished reading his breviary and made his application to Bambousse, he\nswiftly retraced his steps, gazing as he went at his church, now a grey\nspot in the distance, and at the black rigid silhouette which the\nbig cypress-tree, the Solitaire, set against the blue sky. Amidst the\ndrowsiness fostered by the heat, he thought of how richly that evening\nhe might decorate the Lady chapel for the devotions of the month of\nMary. Before him the road offered a carpet of dust, soft to the tread\nand of dazzling whiteness.\n\nAt the Croix-Verte, as the Abbe was about to cross the highway leading\nfrom Plassans to La Palud, a gig coming down the hill compelled him\nto step behind a heap of stones. Then, as he crossed the open space, a\nvoice called to him: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Hallo, Serge, my boy!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe gig had pulled up and from it a man leant over. The priest\nrecognised him--he was an uncle of his, Doctor Pascal Rougon, or\nMonsieur Pascal, as the poor folk of Plassans, whom he attended for\nnothing, briefly styled him. Although barely over fifty, he was already\nsnowy white, with a big beard and abundant hair, amidst which his\nhandsome regular features took an expression of shrewdness and\nbenevolence.*\n\n  * See M. Zola\u00e2\u0080\u0099s novels, _Dr. Pascal_ and _The Fortune of the\n    Rougons_.--ED.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098So you potter about in the dust at this hour of the day?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said\ngaily, as he stooped to grasp the Abbe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hands. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not afraid of\nsunstroke?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No more than you are, uncle,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 answered the priest, laughing.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh, I have the hood of my trap to shield me. Besides, sick folks won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nwait. People die at all times, my boy.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And he went on to relate that\nhe was now on his way to old Jeanbernat, the steward of the Paradou, who\nhad had an apoplectic stroke the night before. A neighbour, a peasant on\nhis way to Plassans market, had summoned him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He must be dead by this time,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the doctor continued. \u00e2\u0080\u0098However, we must\nmake sure.... Those old demons are jolly tough, you know.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe was already raising his whip, when Abbe Mouret stopped him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Stay! what o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock do you make it, uncle?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098A quarter to eleven.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe Abbe hesitated; he already seemed to hear La Teuse\u00e2\u0080\u0099s terrible voice\nbawling in his ears that his luncheon was getting cold. But he plucked\nup courage and added swiftly: \u00e2\u0080\u0098I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go with you, uncle. The unhappy man\nmay wish to reconcile himself to God in his last hour.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nDoctor Pascal could not restrain a laugh.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What, Jeanbernat!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said; \u00e2\u0080\u0098ah, well! if ever you convert him! Never\nmind, come all the same. The sight of you is enough to cure him.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe priest got in. The doctor, apparently regretting his jest, displayed\nan affectionate warmth of manner, whilst from time to time clucking his\ntongue by way of encouraging his horse. And out of the corner of his eye\nhe inquisitively observed his nephew with the keenness of a scientist\nbent on taking notes. In short kindly sentences he inquired about his\nlife, his habits, and the peaceful happiness he enjoyed at Les Artaud.\nAnd at each satisfactory reply he murmured, as if to himself in a tone\nof reassurance: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Come, so much the better; that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just as it should be!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe displayed peculiar anxiety about the young priest\u00e2\u0080\u0099s state of health.\nAnd Serge, greatly surprised, assured him that he was in splendid\ntrim, and had neither fits of giddiness or of nausea, nor headaches\nwhatsoever.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Capital, capital,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 reiterated his uncle Pascal. \u00e2\u0080\u0098In spring, you see,\nthe blood is active. But you are sound enough. By-the-bye, I saw your\nbrother Octave at Marseilles last month. He is off to Paris, where he\nwill get a fine berth in a high-class business. The young beggar, a nice\nlife he leads.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What life?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 innocently inquired the priest.\n\nTo avoid replying the doctor chirruped to his horse, and then went on:\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Briefly, everybody is well--your aunt Felicite, your uncle Rougon, and\nthe others. Still, that does not hinder our needing your prayers. You\nare the saint of the family, my lad; I rely upon you to save the whole\nlot.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe laughed, but in such a friendly, good-humoured way that Serge himself\nbegan to indulge in jocularity.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You see,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 continued Pascal, \u00e2\u0080\u0098there are some among the lot whom it won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nbe easy to lead to Paradise. Some nice confessions you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d hear if all\ncame in turn. For my part, I can do without their confessions; I\nwatch them from a distance; I have got their records at home among my\nbotanical specimens and medical notes. Some day I shall be able to draw\nup a wondrously interesting diagram. We shall see; we shall see!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe was forgetting himself, carried away by his enthusiasm for science. A\nglance at his nephew\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cassock pulled him up short.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098As for you, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a parson,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he muttered; \u00e2\u0080\u0098you did well; a parson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a\nvery happy man. The calling absorbs you, eh? And so you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve taken to the\ngood path. Well! you would never have been satisfied otherwise. Your\nrelatives, starting like you, have done a deal of evil, and still they\nare unsatisfied. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all logically perfect, my lad. A priest completes\nthe family. Besides, it was inevitable. Our blood was bound to run\nto that. So much the better for you; you have had the most luck.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nCorrecting himself, however, with a strange smile, he added: \u00e2\u0080\u0098No, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nyour sister Desiree who has had the best luck of all.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe whistled, whipped up his horse, and changed the conversation. The\ngig, after climbing a somewhat steep slope, was threading its way\nthrough desolate ravines; at last it reached a tableland, where the\nhollow road skirted an interminable and lofty wall. Les Artaud had\ndisappeared; they found themselves in the heart of a desert.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098We are getting near, are we not?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 asked the priest.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098This is the Paradou,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied the doctor, pointing to the wall.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you been this way before, then? We are not three miles from Les\nArtaud. A splendid property it must have been, this Paradou. The park\nwall this side alone is quite a mile and a half long. But for over a\nhundred years it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all been running wild.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There are some fine trees,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 observed the Abbe, as he looked up in\nastonishment at the luxuriant mass of foliage which jutted over.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes, that part is very fertile. In fact, the park is a regular forest\namidst the bare rocks which surround it. The Mascle, too, rises there; I\nhave heard four or five springs mentioned, I fancy.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nIn short sentences, interspersed with irrelevant digressions, he then\nrelated the story of the Paradou, according to the current legend of\nthe countryside. In the time of Louis XV., a great lord had erected\na magnificent palace there, with vast gardens, fountains, trickling\nstreams, and statues--a miniature Versailles hidden away among the\nstones, under the full blaze of the southern sun. But he had there spent\nbut one season with a lady of bewitching beauty, who doubtless died\nthere, as none had ever seen her leave. Next year the mansion was\ndestroyed by fire, the park doors were nailed up, the very loopholes of\nthe walls were filled with mould; and thus, since that remote time, not\na glance had penetrated that vast enclosure which covered the whole of\none of the plateaux of the Garrigue hills.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There can be no lack of nettles there,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 laughingly said Abbe Mouret.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you find that the whole wall reeks of damp, uncle?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nA pause followed, and he asked:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And whom does the Paradou belong to now?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Why, nobody knows,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the doctor answered. \u00e2\u0080\u0098The owner did come here once,\nsome twenty years ago. But he was so scared by the sight of this\nadders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 nest that he has never turned up since. The real master is the\ncaretaker, that old oddity, Jeanbernat, who has managed to find quarters\nin a lodge where the stones still hang together. There it is, see--that\ngrey building yonder, with its windows all smothered in ivy.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe gig passed by a lordly iron gate, ruddy with rust, and lined inside\nwith a layer of boards. The wide dry throats were black with brambles. A\nhundred yards further on was the lodge inhabited by Jeanbernat. It stood\nwithin the park, which it overlooked. But the old keeper had apparently\nblocked up that side of his dwelling, and had cleared a little garden\nby the road. And there he lived, facing southwards, with his back\nturned upon the Paradou, as if unaware of the immensity of verdure that\nstretched away behind him.\n\nThe young priest jumped down, looking inquisitively around him and\nquestioning the doctor, who was hurriedly fastening the horse to a ring\nfixed in the wall.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And the old man lives all alone in this out-of-the-way hole?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes, quite alone,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied his uncle, adding, however, the next minute:\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, he has with him a niece whom he had to take in, a queer girl,\na regular savage. But we must make haste. The whole place looks\ndeath-like.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\nThe house with its shutters closed seemed wrapped in slumber as it stood\nthere in the midday sun, amidst the hum of the big flies that swarmed\nall up the ivy to the roof tiles. The sunlit ruin was steeped in happy\nquietude. When the doctor had opened the gate of the narrow garden,\nwhich was enclosed by a lofty quickset hedge, there, in the shadow cast\nby a wall, they found Jeanbernat, tall and erect, and calmly smoking his\npipe, as in the deep silence he watched his vegetables grow.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What, are you up then, you humbug?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed the astonished doctor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098So you were coming to bury me, were you?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 growled the old man harshly.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want anybody. I bled myself.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe stopped short as he caught sight of the priest, and assumed so\nthreatening an expression that the doctor hastened to intervene.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098This is my nephew,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said; \u00e2\u0080\u0098the new Cure of Les Artaud--a good\nfellow, too. Devil take it, we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been bowling over the roads at\nthis hour of the day to eat you, Jeanbernat.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe old man calmed down a little.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want any shavelings here,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he grumbled. \u00e2\u0080\u0098They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re enough to make\none croak. Mind, doctor, no priests, and no physics when I go off, or we\nshall quarrel. Let him come in, however, as he is your nephew.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAbbe Mouret, struck dumb with amazement, could not speak a word. He\nstood there in the middle of the path scanning that strange solitaire,\nwith scorched, brick-tinted face, and limbs all withered and twisted\nlike a bundle of ropes, who seemed to bear the burden of his eighty\nyears with a scornful contempt for life. When the doctor attempted to\nfeel his pulse, his ill-humour broke out afresh.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Do leave me in peace! I bled myself with my knife, I tell you. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all\nover, now. Who was the fool of a peasant who disturbed you? The doctor\nhere, and the priest as well, why not the mutes too! Well, it can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be\nhelped, people will be fools. It won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t prevent us from having a drink,\neh?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe fetched a bottle and three glasses, and stood them on an old table\nwhich he brought out into the shade. Then, having filled the glasses\nto the brim, he insisted on clinking them. His anger had given place to\njeering cheerfulness.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t poison you, Monsieur le Cure,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said. \u00e2\u0080\u0098A glass of good\nwine isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a sin. Upon my word, however, this is the first time I ever\nclinked a glass with a cassock, but no offence to you. That poor Abbe\nCaffin, your predecessor, refused to argue with me. He was afraid.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nJeanbernat gave vent to a hearty laugh, and then went on: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Just fancy,\nhe had pledged himself that he would prove to me that God exists.\nSo, whenever I met him, I defied him to do it; and he sloped off\ncrestfallen, I can tell you.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What, God does not exist!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cried Abbe Mouret, roused from his silence.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh! just as you please,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 mockingly replied Jeanbernat. \u00e2\u0080\u0098We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll begin\ntogether all over again, if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s any pleasure to you. But I warn you\nthat I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a tough hand at it. There are some thousands of books in one of\nthe rooms upstairs, which were rescued from the fire at the Paradou: all\nthe philosophers of the eighteenth century, a whole heap of old books\non religion. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve learned some fine things from them. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been reading\nthem these twenty years. Marry! you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got some one who can\ntalk, Monsieur le Cure.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe had risen, slowly waving his hand towards the surrounding horizon,\nto the earth and to the sky, and repeating solemnly: \u00e2\u0080\u0098There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing,\nnothing, nothing. When the sun is snuffed out, all will be at an end.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nDoctor Pascal nudged Abbe Mouret with his elbow. With blinking eyes he\nwas curiously observing the old man and nodding approvingly in order to\ninduce him to talk. \u00e2\u0080\u0098So you are a materialist, Jeanbernat?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh, I am only a poor man,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied the old fellow, relighting his pipe.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098When Count de Corbiere, whose foster-brother I was, died from a fall\nfrom his horse, his children sent me here to look after this park of the\nSleeping Beauty, in order to get rid of me. I was sixty years old then,\nand I thought I was about done. But death forgot me; and I had to make\nmyself a burrow. If one lives all alone, look you, one gets to see\nthings in rather a queer fashion. The trees are no longer trees, the\nearth puts on the ways of a living being, the stones seem to tell you\ntales. A parcel of rubbish, eh? But I know some secrets that would\nfairly stagger you. Besides, what do you think there is to do in\nthis devilish desert? I read the old books; it was more amusing than\nshooting. The Count, who used to curse like a heathen, was always saying\nto me: \u00e2\u0080\u009cJeanbernat, my boy, I fully expect to meet you again in the hot\nplace, so that you will be able to serve me there as you have up here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nOnce more he waved his hand to the horizon and added: \u00e2\u0080\u0098You hear,\nnothing; there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all foolery.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nDr. Pascal began to laugh.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098A pleasant piece of foolery, at any rate,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Jeanbernat, you\nare a deceiver. I suspect you are in love, in spite of your affectation\nof being _blase_. You were speaking very tenderly of the trees and\nstones just now.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh, no, I assure you,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 murmured the old man, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I have done with that.\nAt one time, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true, when I first knew you and used to go herborising\nwith you, I was stupid enough to love all sorts of things I came across\nin that huge liar, the country. Fortunately, the old volumes have killed\nall that. I only wish my garden was smaller; I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go out into the\nroad twice a year. You see that bench? That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where I spend all my time,\njust watching my lettuces grow.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And what about your rounds in the park?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 broke in the doctor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098In the park!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 repeated Jeanbernat, with a look of profound surprise.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Why, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more than twelve years since I set foot in it! What do you\nsuppose I could do inside that cemetery? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too big. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stupid, what\nwith those endless trees and moss everywhere and broken statues, and\nholes in which one might break one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s neck at every step. The last time I\nwent in there, it was so dark under the trees, there was such a stink of\nwild flowers, and such queer breezes blew along the paths, that I felt\nalmost afraid. So I have shut myself up to prevent the park coming in\nhere. A patch of sunlight, three feet of lettuce before me, and a\nbig hedge shutting out all the view, why, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more than enough for\nhappiness. Nothing, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like, nothing at all, something so\ntiny that nothing from outside could come to disturb me. Seven feet of\nearth, if you like, just to be able to croak on my back.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe struck the table with his fist, and suddenly raised his voice to call\nout to Abbe Mouret: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Come, just another glass, your reverence. The old\ngentleman isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t at the bottom of the bottle, you know.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe priest felt ill at ease. To lead back to God that singular old man,\nwhose reason seemed to him to be strangely disordered, appeared a task\nbeyond his powers. He now remembered certain bits of gossip he had\nheard from La Teuse about the Philosopher, as the peasants of Les Artaud\ndubbed Jeanbernat. Scraps of scandalous stories vaguely floated in his\nmemory. He rose, making a sign to the doctor that he wished to leave\nthis house, where he seemed to inhale an odour of damnation. But, in\nspite of his covert fears, a strange feeling of curiosity made him\nlinger. He simply walked to the end of the garden, throwing a searching\nglance into the vestibule, as if to see beyond it, behind the walls. All\nhe could perceive, however, through the gaping doorway, was the black\nstaircase. So he came back again, and sought for some hole, some glimpse\nof that sea of foliage which he knew was near by the mighty murmur that\nbroke upon the house, like the sound of waves.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And is the little one well?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 asked the doctor, taking up his hat.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Pretty well,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 answered Jeanbernat. \u00e2\u0080\u0098She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s never here. She often\ndisappears all day long--still, she may be in the upstair rooms.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe raised his head and called: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Albine! Albine!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Then with a shrug of\nhis shoulders, he added: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes, my word, she is a nice hussy.... Well,\ntill next time, Monsieur le Cure. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m always at your disposal.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAbbe Mouret, however, had no time to accept the Philosopher\u00e2\u0080\u0099s challenge.\nA door suddenly opened at the end of the vestibule; a dazzling breach\nwas made in the black darkness of the wall, and through the breach came\na vision of a virgin forest, a great depth of woodland, beneath a\nflood of sunbeams. In that sudden blaze of light the priest distinctly\nperceived certain far-away things: a large yellow flower in the middle\nof a lawn, a sheet of water falling from a lofty rock, a colossal tree\nfilled with a swarm of birds; and all this steeped, lost, blazing in\nsuch a tangle of greenery, such riotous luxuriance of vegetation, that\nthe whole horizon seemed one great burst of shooting foliage. The door\nbanged to, and everything vanished.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! the jade!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cried Jeanbernat, \u00e2\u0080\u0098she was in the Paradou again!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAlbine was now laughing on the threshold of the vestibule. She wore\nan orange-coloured skirt, with a large red kerchief fastened round her\nwaist, thus looking like some gipsy in holiday garb. And she went on\nlaughing, her head thrown back, her bosom swelling with mirth, delighted\nwith her flowers, wild flowers which she had plaited into her fair hair,\nfastened to her neck, her bodice, and her bare slender golden arms. She\nseemed like a huge nosegay, exhaling a powerful perfume.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ay, you are a beauty!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 growled the old man. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You smell of weeds enough\nto poison one--would any one think she was sixteen, that doll?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAlbine remained unabashed, however, and laughed still more heartily.\nDoctor Pascal, who was her great friend, let her kiss him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098So you are not frightened in the Paradou?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Frightened? What of?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said, her eyes wide open with astonishment.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The walls are too high, no one can get in. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only myself. It is\nmy garden, all my very own. A fine big one, too. I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t found out\nwhere it ends yet.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And the animals?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 interrupted the doctor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The animals? Oh! they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hurt; they all know me well.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But it is very dark under the trees?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Course! there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shade: if there were none, the sun would burn my face\nup. It is very pleasant in the shade among the leaves.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe flitted about, filling the little garden with the rustling sweep of\nher skirts, and scattering round the pungent odour of wild flowers which\nclung to her. She had smiled at Abbe Mouret without trace of shyness,\nwithout heed of the astonished look with which he observed her. The\npriest had stepped aside. That fair-haired maid, with long oval face,\nglowing with life, seemed to him to be the weird mysterious offspring of\nthe forest of which he had caught a glimpse in a sheet of sunlight.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I say, I have got some blackbird nestlings; would you like them?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nAlbine asked the doctor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No, thanks,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he answered, laughing. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You should give them to the Cure\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nsister; she is very fond of pets. Good day, Jeanbernat.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAlbine, however, had fastened on the priest.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You are the vicar of Les Artaud, aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you? You have a sister? I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go\nand see her. Only you must not speak to me about God. My uncle will not\nhave it.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You bother us, be off,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed Jeanbernat, shrugging his shoulders.\nThen bounding away like a goat, dropping a shower of flowers behind her,\nshe disappeared. The slam of a door was heard, and from behind the\nhouse came bursts of laughter, which died away in the distance like the\nscampering rush of some mad animal let loose among the grass.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see, she will end by sleeping in the Paradou,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 muttered the old\nman with indifference.\n\nAnd as he saw his visitors off, he added: \u00e2\u0080\u0098If you should find me dead\none of these fine days, doctor, just do me the favour of pitching me\ninto the muck-pit there, behind my lettuces. Good evening, gentlemen.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe let the wooden gate which closed the hedge fall to again, and the\nhouse assumed once more its aspect of happy peacefulness in the noonday\nsunlight, amidst the buzzing of the big flies that swarmed all up the\nivy even to the roof tiles.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\nThe gig once more rolled along the road skirting the Paradou\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ninterminable wall. Abbe Mouret, still silent, scanned with upturned eyes\nthe huge boughs which stretched over that wall, like the arms of giants\nhidden there. All sorts of sounds came from the park: rustling of wings,\nquivering of leaves, furtive bounds at which branches snapped, mighty\nsighs that bowed the young shoots--a vast breath of life sweeping over\nthe crests of a nation of trees. At times, as he heard a birdlike note\nthat seemed like a human laugh, the priest turned his head, as if he\nfelt uneasy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098A queer girl!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said his uncle as he eased the reins a little. \u00e2\u0080\u0098She was\nnine years old when she took up her quarters with that old heathen. Some\nbrother of his had ruined himself, though in what I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remember. The\nlittle one was at school somewhere when her father killed himself. She\nwas even quite a little lady, up to reading, embroidery, chattering, and\nstrumming on the piano. And such a coquette too! I saw her arrive with\nopen-worked stockings, embroidered skirts, frills, cuffs, a heap of\nfinery. Ah, well! the finery didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t last long!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe laughed. A big stone nearly upset the gig.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It will be lucky if I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t leave a wheel in this cursed road!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he\nmuttered. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Hold on, my boy.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe wall still stretched beside them: the priest still listened.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098As you may well imagine,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 continued the doctor, \u00e2\u0080\u0098the Paradou, what with\nits sun, its stones, and its thistles, would wreck a whole outfit every\nday. Three or four mouthfuls, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all it made of all the little one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nbeautiful dresses. She used to come back naked. Now she dresses like\na savage. To-day she was rather presentable; but sometimes she has\nscarcely anything on beyond her shoes and chemise. Did you hear her? The\nParadou is hers. The very day after she came she took possession of it.\nShe lives in it; jumps out of the window when Jeanbernat locks the door,\nbolts off in spite of all, goes nobody knows whither, buries herself in\nsome invisible burrows known only to herself. She must have a fine time\nin that wilderness.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Hark, uncle!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 interrupted Abbe Mouret. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that some animal running\nbehind the wall?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nUncle Pascal listened.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said after a minute\u00e2\u0080\u0099s silence, \u00e2\u0080\u0098it is the rattle of the trap on\nthe stones. No, the child doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t play the piano now. I believe she has\neven forgotten how to read. Just picture to yourself a young lady gone\nback to a state of primevalness, turned out to play on a desert island.\nMy word, if ever you get to know of a girl who needs proper bringing up,\nI advise you not to entrust her to Jeanbernat. He has a most primitive\nway of letting nature alone. When I ventured to speak to him about\nAlbine he answered me that he must not prevent trees from growing\nas they pleased. He says he is for the normal development of\ntemperaments.... All the same, they are very interesting, both of them.\nI never come this way without paying them a visit.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe gig was now emerging from the hollowed road. At this point the wall\nof the Paradou turned and wound along the crest of the hills as far\nas one could see. As Abbe Mouret turned to take a last look at that\ngrey-hued barrier, whose impenetrable austerity had at last begun to\nannoy him, a rustling of shaken boughs was heard and a clump of young\nbirch trees seemed to bow in greeting from above the wall.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I knew some animal was running behind,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the priest.\n\nBut, although nobody could be seen, though nothing was visible in the\nair above save the birches rocking more and more violently, they heard a\nclear, laughing voice call out: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Good-bye, doctor! good-bye, Monsieur le\nCure! I am kissing the tree, and the tree is sending you my kisses.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Why! it is Albine,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed Doctor Pascal. \u00e2\u0080\u0098She must have followed\nthe trap at a run. Jumping over bushes is mere play to her, the little\nelf!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAnd he in his turn shouted out:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Good-bye, my pet! How tall you must be to bow like that.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe laughter grew louder, the birches bowed still lower, scattering\ntheir leaves around even on the hood of the gig.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am as tall as the trees; all the leaves that fall are kisses,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nreplied the voice now mellowed by distance, so musical, so merged into\nthe rippling whispers of the park, that the young priest was thrilled.\n\nThe road grew better. On coming down the slope Les Artaud reappeared in\nthe midst of the scorched plain. When the gig reached the turning to\nthe village, Abbe Mouret would not let his uncle drive him back to the\nvicarage. He jumped down, saying:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No, thanks, I prefer to walk: it will do me good.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, just as you like,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 at last answered the doctor. And with a clasp\nof the hand, he added: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, if you only had such parishioners as that\nold brute Jeanbernat, you wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t often be disturbed. However, you\nyourself wanted to come. And mind you keep well. At the slightest ache,\nnight or day, send for me. You know I attend all the family gratis....\nThere, good-bye, my boy.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\n\n\nX\n\nAbbe Mouret felt more at ease when he found himself again alone, walking\nalong the dusty road. The stony fields brought him back to his dream of\nausterity, of an inner life spent in a desert. From the trees all along\nthe sunken road disturbing moisture had fallen on his neck, which now\nthe burning sun was drying. The sight of the lean almond trees, the\nscanty corn crops, the weak vines, on either side of the way, soothed\nhim, delivered him from the perturbation into which the lusty atmosphere\nof the Paradou had thrown him. Amid the blinding glare that flowed from\nheaven over the bare land, Jeanbernat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blasphemies no longer cast even\na shadow. A thrill of pleasure ran through the priest as he raised his\nhead and caught sight of the solitaire\u00e2\u0080\u0099s motionless bar-like silhouette\nand the pink patch of tiles on the church.\n\nBut, as he walked on, fresh anxiety beset the Abbe. La Teuse would give\nhim a fine reception; for his luncheon must have been waiting nearly two\nhours for him. He pictured her terrible face, the flood of words with\nwhich she would greet him, the angry clatter of kitchen ware which he\nwould hear the whole afternoon. When he had got through Les Artaud,\nhis fear became so lively that he hesitated, full of trepidation, and\nwondered if it would not be better to go round and reach the parsonage\nby way of the church. But, while he deliberated, La Teuse herself\nappeared on the doorstep of the parsonage, her cap all awry, and her\nhands on her hips. With drooping head he had perforce to climb the\nslope under her storm-laden gaze, which he could feel weighing upon his\nshoulders.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I believe I am rather late, my good Teuse,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he stammered, as he turned\nthe path\u00e2\u0080\u0099s last bend.\n\nLa Teuse waited till he stood quite close before her. She then gave him\na furious glance, and, without a word, turned and stalked before him\ninto the dining-room, banging her big heels upon the floor-tiles and so\nrigid with ire that she hardly limped at all.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I have had so many things to do,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 began the priest, scared by this dumb\nreception. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I have been running about all the morning.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut she cut him short with another look, so fixed, so full of anger,\nthat he felt his legs give way under him. He sat down, and began to eat.\nShe waited on him in the sharp, mechanical manner of an automaton, all\nbut breaking the plates with the violence with which she set them down.\nThe silence became so awful that, choking with emotion, he was unable to\nswallow his third mouthful.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098My sister has had her luncheon?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he asked. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Quite right of her.\nLuncheon should always be served whenever I am kept out.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nNo answer came. La Teuse stood there waiting to remove his plate as\nsoon as he should have emptied it. Thereupon, feeling that he could\nnot possibly eat with those implacable eyes crushing him, he pushed his\nplate away. This angry gesture acted on La Teuse like a whip stroke,\nrousing her from her obstinate stiffness. She fairly jumped.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how it is!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she exclaimed. \u00e2\u0080\u0098There you are again, losing your\ntemper! Very well, I am off; you can pay my fare, so that I may go back\nhome. I have had enough of Les Artaud, and your church, and everything\nelse!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe took off her apron with trembling hands.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You must have seen that I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wish to say anything to you. A nice\nlife, indeed! Only mountebanks do such things, Monsieur le Cure! This\nis eleven o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it! Aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you ashamed of sitting at table when\nit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s almost two o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not like a Christian, no, it is not like a\nChristian!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAnd, taking her stand before him, she went on: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, where do you come\nfrom? whom have you seen? what business can have kept you? If only you\nwere a child you would have the whip. It isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the place for a priest to\nbe, on the roads in the blazing sun like a tramp without a roof to put\nover his head. A fine state you are in, with your shoes all white and\nyour cassock smothered in dust! Who will brush your cassock for you?\nWho will buy you another one? Speak out, will you; tell me what you have\nbeen doing! My word! if everybody didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know you, they would end by\nthinking queer things about you. And shall I tell you? Why, I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say\nbut what you may have been up to something wrong. When folks lunch at\nsuch hours they are capable of anything!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAbbe Mouret let the storm blow over him. At the old servant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wrathful\nwords he experienced a kind of relief.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Come, my good Teuse,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098you will first put your apron on\nagain.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No, no,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she cried, \u00e2\u0080\u0098it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all over, I am going.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut he got up and, laughing, tied her apron round her waist. She\nstruggled against him and stuttered: \u00e2\u0080\u0098I tell you no! You are a wheedler.\nI can see through your game, I see you want to come it over me with your\nhoneyed words. Where did you go? We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see afterwards.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe gaily sat down to table again like a man who has gained a victory.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098First, I must be allowed to eat. I am dying with hunger,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said he.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No doubt,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she murmured, her pity moved. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Is there any common sense\nin it? Would you like me to fry you a couple of eggs? It would not take\nlong. Well, if you have enough. But everything is cold! And I had taken\nsuch pains with your aubergines! Nice they are now! They look like old\nshoe-leather. Luckily you haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t got a tender tooth like poor Monsieur\nCaffin. Yes, you have some good points, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deny it.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThus chattering, she waited on him with all a mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s care. After he\nhad finished she ran to the kitchen to see if the coffee was still warm.\nShe frisked about and limped most outrageously in her delight at having\nmade things up with him. As a rule Abbe Mouret fought shy of coffee,\nwhich always upset his nervous system; but on this occasion, to ratify\nthe conclusion of peace, he took the cup she brought him. And as he\nlingered at table she sat down opposite him and repeated gently, like a\nwoman tortured by curiosity:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Where have you been, Monsieur le Cure?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he answered with a smile, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I have seen the Brichets, I have\nspoken to Bambousse.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThereupon he had to relate to her what the Brichets had said, what\nBambousse had decided, and how they looked, and where they were at work.\nWhen he repeated to her the answer of Rosalie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Of course!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she\nexclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u0098if the child should die her mishap would go for nothing.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nAnd clasping her hands with a look of envious admiration she added, \u00e2\u0080\u0098How\nyou must have chattered, your reverence! More than half the day spent\nto obtain such a fine result! You took it easy coming home? It must have\nbeen very hot on the road?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe Abbe, who by this time had risen, made no answer. He had been on\nthe point of speaking about the Paradou, and asking for some information\nconcerning it. But a fear of being flooded with eager questions, and a\nkind of vague unavowed shame, made him keep silence respecting his visit\nto Jeanbernat. He cut all further questions short by asking:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Where is my sister? I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hear her.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Come along, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said La Teuse, beginning to laugh, and raising her\nfinger to her lips.\n\nThey went into the next room, a country drawing-room, hung with faded\nwall-paper showing large grey flowers, and furnished with four armchairs\nand a sofa, covered with horse-hair. On the sofa now slept Desiree,\nstretched out at full length, with her head resting on her clenched\nhands. The pronounced curve of her bosom was raised somewhat by her\nupstretched arms, bare to the elbows. She was breathing somewhat\nheavily, her red lips parted, and thus showing her teeth.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Lord! isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t she sleeping sound!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 whispered La Teuse. \u00e2\u0080\u0098She didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even\nhear you pitching into me just now. Well, she must be precious tired.\nJust fancy, she was cleaning up her yard till nearly noon. And when she\nhad eaten something, she came and dropped down there like a shot. She\nhas not stirred since.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nFor a moment the priest gazed lovingly at her. \u00e2\u0080\u0098We must let her have as\nmuch rest as she wants,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Of course. Isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it a pity she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s such an innocent? Just look at those\nbig arms! Whenever I dress her I always think what a fine woman she\nwould have made. Ay, she would have brought you some splendid\nnephews, sir. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you think she is like that stone lady in Plassans\ncorn-market?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe spoke thus of a Cybele stretched upon sheaves of wheat, the work\nof one of Puget\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pupils, which was carved on the frontal of the market\nbuilding. Without replying, however, Abbe Mouret gently pushed her out\nof the room, and begged her to make as little noise as possible. Till\nevening, therefore, perfect silence settled on the parsonage. La Teuse\nfinished her washing in the shed. The priest, seated at the bottom of\nthe little garden, his breviary fallen on his lap, remained absorbed\nin pious thoughts, while all around him rosy petals rained from the\nblossoming peach-trees.\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\nAbout six o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock there came a sudden wakening. A noise of doors opening\nand closing, accompanied by bursts of laughter, shook the whole house.\nDesiree appeared, her hair all down and her arms still half bare.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Serge! Serge!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she called.\n\nAnd catching sight of her brother in the garden, she ran up to him and\nsat down for a minute on the ground at his feet, begging him to follow\nher:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Do come and see the animals! You haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen the animals yet, have\nyou? If you only knew how beautiful they are now!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe had to beg very hard, for the yard rather scared him. But when he\nsaw tears in Desiree\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes, he yielded. She threw herself on his neck\nin a sudden puppy-like burst of glee, laughing more than ever, without\nattempting to dry her cheeks.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh! how nice you are!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she stammered, as she dragged him off. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You\nshall see the hens, the rabbits, the pigeons, and my ducks which have\ngot fresh water, and my goat, whose room is as clean as mine now. I have\nthree geese and two turkeys, you know. Come quick. You shall see all.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nDesiree was then twenty-two years old. Reared in the country by her\nnurse, a peasant woman of Saint-Eutrope, she had grown up anyhow. Her\nbrain void of all serious thoughts, she had thriven on the fat soil\nand open air of the country, developing physically but never mentally,\ngrowing into a lovely animal--white, with rosy blood and firm skin. She\nwas not unlike a high-bred donkey endowed with the power of laughter.\nAlthough she dabbled about from morning till night, her delicate hands\nand feet, the supple outlines of her hips, the bourgeois refinement of\nher maiden form remained unimpaired; so that she was in truth a creature\napart--neither lady nor peasant--but a girl nourished by the soil, with\nthe broad shoulders and narrow brow of a youthful goddess.\n\nDoubtless it was by reason of her weak intellect that she was drawn\ntowards animals. She was never happy save with them; she understood\ntheir language far better than that of mankind, and looked after them\nwith motherly affection. Her reasoning powers were deficient, but\nin lieu thereof she had an instinct which put her on a footing of\nintelligence with them. At their very first cry of pain she knew what\nailed them; she would choose dainties upon which they would pounce\ngreedily. A single gesture from her quelled their squabbles. She seemed\nto know their good or their evil character at a glance; and related\nsuch long tales about the tiniest chick, with such an abundance and\nminuteness of detail, as to astound those to whom one chicken was\nexactly like any other. Her farmyard had thus become a country, as it\nwere, over which she reigned; a country complex in its organisation,\ndisturbed by rebellions, peopled by the most diverse creatures whose\nrecords were known to her alone. So accurate was her instinct that she\ndetected the unfertile eggs in a sitting, and foretold the number of a\nlitter of rabbits.\n\nWhen, at sixteen, Desiree became a young woman, she retained all her\nwonted health; and rapidly developed, with round, free-swaying bust,\nbroad hips like those of an antique statue, the full growth indeed of\na vigorous animal. One might have thought that she had sprung from the\nrich soil of her poultry-yard, that she absorbed the sap with her sturdy\nlegs, which were as firm as young trees. And nought disturbed her\namidst all this plenitude. She found continuous satisfaction in being\nsurrounded by birds and animals which ever increased and multiplied,\ntheir fruitfulness filling her with delight. Nothing could have been\nhealthier. She innocently feasted on the odour and warmth of life,\nknowing no depraved curiosity, but retaining all the tranquillity of a\nbeautiful animal, simply happy at seeing her little world thus multiply,\nfeeling as if she thereby became a mother, the common natural mother of\none and all.\n\nSince she had been living at Les Artaud, she had spent her days in\ncomplete beatitude. At last she was satisfying the dream of her life,\nthe only desire which had worried her amidst her weak-minded puerility.\nShe had a poultry-yard, a nook all to herself, where she could breed\nanimals to her heart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s content. And she almost lived there, building\nrabbit-hutches with her own hands, digging out a pond for the ducks,\nknocking in nails, fetching straw, allowing no one to assist her. All\nthat La Teuse had to do was to wash her afterwards. The poultry-yard was\nsituated behind the cemetery; and Desiree often had to jump the wall,\nand run hither and thither among the graves after some fowl whom\ncuriosity had led astray. Right at the end was a shed giving\naccommodation to the fowls and the rabbits; to the right was a little\nstable for the goat. Moreover, all the animals lived together; the\nrabbits ran about with the fowls, the nanny-goat would take a footbath\nin the midst of the ducks; the geese, the turkeys, the guinea-fowls,\nand the pigeons all fraternised in the company of three cats. Whenever\nDesiree appeared at the wooden fence which prevented her charges from\nmaking their way into the church, a deafening uproar greeted her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Eh! can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you hear them?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said to her brother, as they reached the\ndining-room door.\n\nBut, when she had admitted him and closed the gate behind them, she was\nassailed so violently that she almost disappeared. The ducks and the\ngeese, opening and shutting their beaks, tugged at her skirts; the\ngreedy hens sprang up and pecked her hands; the rabbits squatted on her\nfeet and then bounded up to her knees; whilst the three cats leapt upon\nher shoulders, and the goat bleated in its stable at being unable to\nreach her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Leave me alone, do! all you creatures!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she cried with a hearty\nsonorous laugh, feeling tickled by all the feathers, claws, and beaks\nand paws rubbing against her.\n\nHowever, she did not attempt to free herself. As she often said, she\nwould have let herself be devoured; it seemed so sweet to feel all this\nlife cling to her and encompass her with the warmth of eider-down. At\nlast only one cat persisted in remaining on her back.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Moumou,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said. \u00e2\u0080\u0098His paws are like velvet.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Then, calling her\nbrother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attention to the yard, she proudly added: \u00e2\u0080\u0098See, how clean it\nis!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe yard had indeed been swept out, washed, and raked over. But the\ndisturbed water and the forked-up litter exhaled so fetid and powerful\nan odour that Abbe Mouret half choked. The dung was heaped against the\ngraveyard wall in a huge smoking mound.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What a pile, eh?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 continued Desiree, leading her brother into the\npungent vapour, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I put it all there myself, nobody helped me. Go on, it\nisn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t dirty. It cleans. Look at my arms.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAs she spoke she held out her arms, which she had merely dipped into\na pail of water--regal arms they were, superbly rounded, blooming like\nfull white roses amidst the manure.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes, yes,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 gently said the priest, \u00e2\u0080\u0098you have worked hard. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very\nnice now.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen he turned towards the wicket, but she stopped him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Do wait a bit. You shall see them all. You have no idea--\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And so\nsaying, she dragged him to the rabbit house under the shed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There are young ones in all the hutches,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said, clapping her hands\nin glee.\n\nThen at great length she proceeded to explain to him all about the\nlitters. He had to crouch down and come close to the wire netting,\nwhilst she gave him minute details. The mother does, with big restless\nears, eyed him askance, panting and motionless with fear. Then, in\none hutch, he saw a hairy cavity wherein crawled a living heap, an\nindistinct dusky mass heaving like a single body. Close by some young\nones, with enormous heads, ventured to the edge of the hole. A little\nfarther were yet stronger ones, who looked like young rats, ferreting\nand leaping about with their raised rumps showing their white scuts.\nOthers, white ones with pale ruby eyes, and black ones with jet eyes,\ngalloped round their hutches with playful grace. Now a scare would make\nthem bolt off swiftly, revealing at every leap their slender reddened\npaws. Next they would squat down all in a heap, so closely packed that\ntheir heads could no longer be seen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is you they are frightened at,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Desiree kept on saying. \u00e2\u0080\u0098They know\nme well.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe called them and drew some bread-crust from her pocket. The little\nrabbits then became more confident, and, with puckered noses, kept\nsidling up, and rearing against the netting one by one. She kept them\nlike that for a minute to show her brother the rosy down upon their\nbellies, and then gave her crust to the boldest one. Upon this the whole\nof them flocked up, sliding forward and squeezing one another, but never\nquarreling. At one moment three little ones were all nibbling the same\npiece of crust, but others darted away, turning to the wall so as to\neat in peace, while their mothers in the rear remained snuffing\ndistrustfully and refused the crusts.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh! the greedy little things!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed Desiree. \u00e2\u0080\u0098They would eat like\nthat till to-morrow morning! At night, even, you can bear them crunching\nthe leaves they have overlooked in the day-time.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe priest had risen as if to depart, but she never wearied of smiling\non her dear little ones.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You see the big one there, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all white, with black ears--Well! he\ndotes on poppies. He is very clever at picking them out from the other\nweeds. The other day he got the colic. So I took him and kept him warm\nin my pocket. Since then he has been quite frisky.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe poked her fingers through the wire netting and stroked the rabbits\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nbacks.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you say it was satin?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she continued. \u00e2\u0080\u0098They are dressed like\nprinces. And ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t they coquettish! Look, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one who is always\ncleaning himself. He wears the fur off his paws.... If only you knew how\nfunny they are! I say nothing, but I see all their little games. That\ngrey one looking at us, for instance, used to hate a little doe, which\nI had to put somewhere else. There were terrible scenes between them.\nIt would take too long to tell you all, but the last time he gave her\na drubbing, when I came up in a rage, what do you think I saw? Why that\nrascal huddled up at the back there as if he was just at his last gasp.\nHe wanted to make me believe that it was he who had to complain of her.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen Desiree paused to apostrophise the rabbit. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes, you may listen to\nme; you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a rogue!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And turning towards her brother, \u00e2\u0080\u0098He understands\nall I say,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she added softly, with a wink.\n\nBut Abbe Mouret could stand it no longer. He was perturbed by the heat\nthat emanated from the litters, the life that crawled under the hair\nplucked from the does\u00e2\u0080\u0099 bellies, exhaling powerful emanations. On the\nother hand, Desiree, as if slowly intoxicated, was growing brighter and\npinker.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing to take you away!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she cried; \u00e2\u0080\u0098you always seem\nanxious to go off. You must see my little chicks! They were born last\nnight.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe took some rice and threw a handful before her. The hen gravely drew\nnear, clucking to the little band of chickens that followed her chirping\nand scampering as if in bewilderment. When they were fairly in the\nmiddle of the scattered rice the hen eagerly pecked at it, and threw\ndown the grains she cracked, while her little ones hastily began to\nfeed. All the charm of infancy was theirs. Half-naked as it were, with\nround heads, eyes sparkling like steel needles, beaks so queerly set,\nand down so quaintly ruffled up, they looked like penny toys. Desiree\nlaughed with enjoyment at sight of them.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What little loves they are!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she stammered.\n\nShe took up two of them, one in each hand, and smothered them with eager\nkisses. And then the priest had to inspect them all over, while she\ncoolly said to him:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t easy to tell the cocks. But I never make a mistake. This one\nis a hen, and this one is a hen too.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen she set them on the ground again. Other hens were now coming up\nto eat the rice. A large ruddy cock with flaming plumage followed them,\nlifting his large feet with majestic caution.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Alexander is getting splendid,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Abbe, to please his sister.\n\nAlexander was the cock\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name. He looked up at the young girl with his\nfiery eye, his head turned round, his tail outspread, and then installed\nhimself close by her skirts.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He is very fond of me,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Only I can touch him. He is a good\nbird. There are fourteen hens, and never do I find a bad egg in the\nnests. Do I, Alexander?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe stooped; the bird did not fly from her caress. A rush of blood\nseemed to set his comb aflame; flapping his wings, and stretching out\nhis neck, he burst into a long crow which rang out like a blast from a\nbrazen throat. Four times did he repeat his crow while all the cocks of\nLes Artaud answered in the distance. Desiree was greatly amused by her\nbrother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s startled looks.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He deafens one, eh?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said. \u00e2\u0080\u0098He has a splendid voice. But he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nnot vicious, I assure you, though the hens are--You remember the\nbig speckled one, that used to lay yellow eggs? Well, the day before\nyesterday she hurt her foot. When the others saw the blood they went\nquite mad. They all followed her, pecking at her and drinking her blood,\nso that by the evening they had eaten up her foot. I found her with her\nhead behind a stone, like an idiot, saying nothing, and letting herself\nbe devoured.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe remembrance of the fowls\u00e2\u0080\u0099 voracity made her laugh. She calmly\nrelated other cruelties of theirs: young chickens devoured, of which she\nhad only found the necks and wings, and a litter of kittens eaten up in\nthe stable in a few hours.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You might give them a human being,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she continued, \u00e2\u0080\u0098they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d finish him.\nAnd aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t they tough livers! They get on with a broken limb even. They\nmay have wounds, big holes in their bodies, and still they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll gobble\ntheir victuals. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what I like them for; their flesh grows again\nin two days; they are always as warm as if they had a store of sunshine\nunder their feathers. When I want to give them a treat, I cut them up\nsome raw meat. And worms too! Wait, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see how they love them.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe ran to the dungheap, and unhesitatingly picked up a worm she found\nthere. The fowls darted at her hands; but to amuse herself with the\nsight of their greediness she held the worm high above them. At last\nshe opened her fingers, and forthwith the fowls hustled one another and\npounced upon the worm. One of them fled with it in her beak, pursued\nby the others; it was thus taken, snatched away, and retaken many times\nuntil one hen, with a mighty gulp, swallowed it altogether. At that\nthey all stopped short with heads thrown back, and eyes on the alert for\nanother worm. Desiree called them by their names, and talked pettingly\nto them; while Abbe Mouret retreated a few steps from this display of\nvoracious life.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No, I am not at all comfortable,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said to his sister, when she tried\nto make him feel the weight of a fowl she was fattening. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It always\nmakes me uneasy to touch live animals.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe tried to smile, but Desiree taxed him with cowardice.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah well, what about my ducks, and geese, and turkeys?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said she. \u00e2\u0080\u0098What\nwould you do if you had all those to look after? Ducks are dirty, if you\nlike. Do you hear them shaking their bills in the water? And when they\ndive, you can only see their tails sticking straight up like ninepins.\nGeese and turkeys, too, are not easy to manage. Isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it fun to see them\nwalking along with their long necks, some quite white and others quite\nblack? They look like ladies and gentlemen. And I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t advise you\nto trust your finger to them. They would swallow it at a gulp. But my\nfingers, they only kiss--see!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHer words were cut short by a joyous bleat from the goat, which had at\nlast forced the door of the stable open. Two bounds and the animal was\nclose to her, bending its forelegs, and affectionately rubbing its horns\nagainst her. To the priest, with its pointed beard and obliquely set\neyes, it seemed to wear a diabolical grin. But Desiree caught it round\nthe neck, kissed its head, played and ran with it, and talked about how\nshe liked to drink its milk. She often did so, she said, when she was\nthirsty in the stable.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098See, it has plenty of milk,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she added, pointing to the animal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s udder.\n\nThe priest lowered his eyes. He could remember having once seen in\nthe cloister of Saint-Saturnin at Plassans a horrible stone gargoyle,\nrepresenting a goat and a monk; and ever since he had always looked on\ngoats as dissolute creatures of hell. His sister had only been allowed\nto get one after weeks of begging. For his part, whenever he came to\nthe yard, he shunned all contact with the animal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long silky coat, and\ncarefully guarded his cassock from the touch of its horns.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098All right, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll let you go now,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Desiree, becoming aware of his\ngrowing discomfort. \u00e2\u0080\u0098But you must just let me show you something else\nfirst. Promise not to scold me, won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you? I have not said anything to\nyou about it, because you wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have allowed it.... But if you only\nknew how pleased I am!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAs she spoke she put on an entreating expression, clasped her hands, and\nlaid her head upon her brother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shoulder.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Another piece of folly, no doubt,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he murmured, unable to refrain from\nsmiling.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind, will you?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she continued, her eyes glistening with\ndelight. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be angry?--He is so pretty!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThereupon she ran to open the low door under the shed, and forthwith a\nlittle pig bounded into the middle of the yard.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh! isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t he a cherub?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she exclaimed with a look of profound rapture\nas she saw him leap out.\n\nThe little pig was indeed charming, quite pink, his snout washed clean\nby the greasy slops placed before him, though incessant routing in his\ntrough had left a ring of dirt about his eyes. He trotted about, hustled\nthe fowls, rushing to gobble up whatever was thrown them, and upsetting\nthe little yard with his sudden turns and twists. His ears flapped over\nhis eyes, his snout went snorting over the ground, and with his slender\nfeet he resembled a toy animal on wheels. From behind, his tail looked\nlike a bit of string that served to hang him up by.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have this beast here!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed the priest, terribly put out.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh, Serge, dear old Serge,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 begged Desiree again, \u00e2\u0080\u0098don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be so unkind.\nSee, what a harmless little thing he is! I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll wash him, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll keep him\nvery clean. La Teuse went and had him given her for me. We can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t send\nhim back now. See, he is looking at you; he wants to smell you. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be\nafraid, he won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t eat you.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut she broke off, seized with irresistible laughter. The little pig had\nblundered in a dazed fashion between the goat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legs, and tripped her\nup. And he was now madly careering round, squeaking, rolling, scaring\nall the denizens of the poultry-yard. To quiet him Desiree had to get\nhim an earthen pan full of dish-water. In this he wallowed up to his\nears, splashing and grunting, while quick quivers of delight coursed\nover his rosy skin. And now his uncurled tail hung limply down.\n\nThe stirring of this foul water put a crowning touch to Abbe Mouret\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ndisgust. Ever since he had been there, he had choked more and more; his\nhands and chest and face were afire, and he felt quite giddy. The odour\nof the fowls and rabbits, the goat, and the pig, all mingled in one\npestilential stench. The atmosphere, laden with the ferments of life,\nwas too heavy for his maiden shoulders. And it seemed to him that\nDesiree had grown taller, expanding at the hips, waving huge arms,\nsweeping the ground with her skirts, and stirring up all that powerful\nodour which overpowered him. He had only just time to open the wicket.\nHis feet clung to the stone flags still dank with manure, in such wise\nthat it seemed as if he were held there by some clasp of the soil.\nAnd suddenly, despite himself, there came back to him a memory of\nthe Paradou, with its huge trees, its black shadows, its penetrating\nperfumes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There, you are quite red now,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Desiree said to him as she joined him\noutside the wicket. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you pleased to have seen everything? Do you\nhear the noise they are making?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nOn seeing her depart, the birds and animals had thrown themselves\nagainst the trellis work emitting piteous cries. The little pig,\nespecially, gave vent to prolonged whines that suggested the sharpening\nof a saw. Desiree, however, curtsied to them and kissed her finger-tips\nto them, laughing at seeing them all huddled together there, like so\nmany lovers of hers. Then, hugging her brother, as she accompanied him\nto the garden, she whispered into his ear with a blush: \u00e2\u0080\u0098I should so\nlike a cow.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe looked at her, with a ready gesture of disapproval.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No, no, not now,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she hurriedly went on. \u00e2\u0080\u0098We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll talk about it again\nlater on---- But there would be room in the stable. A lovely white cow\nwith red spots. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099d soon see what nice milk we should have. A goat\nbecomes too little in the end. And when the cow has a calf!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAt the mere thought of this she skipped and clapped her hands with glee;\nand to the priest she seemed to have brought the poultry-yard away with\nher in her skirts. So he left her at the end of the garden, sitting in\nthe sunlight on the ground before a hive, whence the bees buzzed like\ngolden berries round her neck, along her bare arms and in her hair,\nwithout thought of stinging her.\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\nBrother Archangias dined at the parsonage every Thursday. As a rule he\ncame early so as to talk over parish matters. It was he who, for the\nlast three months, had kept the Abbe informed of all the affairs of the\nvalley. That Thursday, while waiting till La Teuse should call them,\nthey strolled about in front of the church. The priest, on relating his\ninterview with Bambousse, was surprised to find that the Brother thought\nthe peasant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reply quite natural.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Ignorantin.* \u00e2\u0080\u0098You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give away chattels\nlike that. Rosalie is no great bargain, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always hard to see your\nown daughter throw herself away on a pauper.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n  * A popular name in France for a Christian Brother.--ED.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Still,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 rejoined Abbe Mouret, \u00e2\u0080\u0098a marriage is the only way of stopping\nthe scandal.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe Brother shrugged his big shoulders and laughed aggravatingly.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Do you think you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll cure the neighbourhood with that marriage?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he\nexclaimed. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Before another two years Catherine will be following her\nsister\u00e2\u0080\u0099s example. They all go the same way, and as they end by marrying,\nthey snap their fingers at every one. These Artauds flourish in it all,\nas on a congenial dungheap. There is only one possible remedy, as I\nhave told you before: wring all the girls\u00e2\u0080\u0099 necks if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want the\ncountry to be poisoned. No husbands, Monsieur le Cure, but a good thick\nstick!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen calming down a bit, he added: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Let every one do with their own as\nthey think best.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe went on to speak about fixing the hours for the catechism classes;\nbut Abbe Mouret replied in an absent-minded way, his eyes dwelling on\nthe village at his feet in the setting sun. The peasants were wending\ntheir way homewards, silently and slowly, with the dragging steps of\nwearied oxen returning to their sheds. Before the tumble-down houses\nstood women calling to one another, carrying on bawling conversations\nfrom door to door, while bands of children filled the roadway with the\nriot of their big clumsy shoes, grovelling and rolling and pushing\neach other about. A bestial odour ascended from that heap of tottering\nhouses, and the priest once more fancied himself in Desiree\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\npoultry-yard, where life ever increased and multiplied. Here, too, was\nthe same incessant travail, which so disturbed him. Since morning his\nmind had been running on that episode of Rosalie and Fortune, and now\nhis thoughts returned to it, to the foul features of existence, the\nincessant, fated task of Nature, which sowed men broadcast like grains\nof wheat. The Artauds were a herd penned in between four ranges of\nhills, increasing, multiplying, spreading more and more thickly over the\nland with each successive generation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098See,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cried Brother Archangias, interrupting his discourse to point\nto a tall girl who was letting her sweetheart snatch a kiss, \u00e2\u0080\u0098there is\nanother hussy over there!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe shook his long black arms at the couple and made them flee. In the\ndistance, over the crimson fields and the peeling rocks, the sun was\ndying in one last flare. Night gradually came on. The warm fragrance\nof the lavender became cooler on the wings of the light evening breeze\nwhich now arose. From time to time a deep sigh fell on the ear as if\nthat fearful land, consumed by ardent passions, had at length grown\ncalm under the soft grey rain of twilight. Abbe Mouret, hat in hand,\ndelighted with the coolness, once more felt quietude descend upon him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Monsieur le Cure! Brother Archangias!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cried La Teuse. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Come quick! The\nsoup is on the table.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nIt was cabbage soup, and its odoriferous steam filled the parsonage\ndining-room. The Brother seated himself and fell to, slowly emptying the\nhuge plate that La Teuse had put down before him. He was a big eater,\nand clucked his tongue as each mouthful descended audibly into his\nstomach. Keeping his eyes on his spoon, he did not speak a word.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t my soup good, then, Monsieur le Cure?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the old servant asked the\npriest. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You are only fiddling with your plate.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am not a bit hungry, my good Teuse,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Serge replied, smiling.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well! how can one wonder at it when you go on as you do! But you would\nhave been hungry, if you hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t lunched at past two o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBrother Archangias, tilting into his spoon the last few drops of soup\nremaining in his plate, said gravely: \u00e2\u0080\u0098You should be regular in your\nmeals, Monsieur le Cure.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAt this moment Desiree, who also had finished her soup, sedately and in\nsilence, rose and followed La Teuse to the kitchen. The Brother, then\nleft alone with Abbe Mouret, cut himself some long strips of bread,\nwhich he ate while waiting for the next dish.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098So you made a long round to-day?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he asked the priest. But before\nthe other could reply a noise of footsteps, exclamations, and ringing\nlaughter, arose at the end of the passage, in the direction of the yard.\nA short altercation apparently took place. A flute-like voice which\ndisturbed the Abbe rose in vexed and hurried accents, which finally died\naway in a burst of glee.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What can it be?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Serge, rising from his chair.\n\nBut Desiree bounded in again, carrying something hidden in her\ngathered-up skirt. And she burst out excitedly: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t she queer? She\nwouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come in at all. I caught hold of her dress; but she is awfully\nstrong; she soon got away from me.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Whom on earth is she talking about?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 asked La Teuse, running in from\nthe kitchen with a dish of potatoes, across which lay a piece of bacon.\n\nThe girl sat down, and with the greatest caution drew from her skirt a\nblackbird\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nest in which three wee fledglings were slumbering. She\nlaid it on her plate. The moment the little birds felt the light, they\nstretched out their feeble necks and opened their crimson beaks to ask\nfor food. Desiree clapped her hands, enchanted, seized with strange\nemotion at the sight of these hitherto unknown creatures.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that Paradou girl!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed the Abbe suddenly, remembering\neverything.\n\nLa Teuse had gone to the window. \u00e2\u0080\u0098So it is,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I might have\nknown that grasshopper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice---- Oh! the gipsy! Look, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stopped\nthere to spy on us.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAbbe Mouret drew near. He, too, thought that he could see Albine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\norange-coloured skirt behind a juniper bush. But Brother Archangias, in\na towering passion, raised himself on tiptoe behind him, and, stretching\nout his fist and wagging his churlish head, thundered forth: \u00e2\u0080\u0098May the\ndevil take you, you brigand\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daughter! I will drag you right round the\nchurch by your hair if ever I catch you coming and casting your evil\nspells here!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nA peal of laughter, fresh as the breath of night, rang out from the\npath, followed by light hasty footsteps and the swish of a dress\nrustling through the grass like an adder. Abbe Mouret, standing at\nthe window, saw something golden glide through the pine trees like a\nmoonbeam. The breeze, wafted in from the open country, was now laden\nwith that penetrating perfume of verdure, that scent of wildflowers,\nwhich Albine had scattered from her bare arms, unfettered bosom, and\nstreaming tresses at the Paradou.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098An accursed soul! a child of perdition!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 growled Brother Archangias,\nas he reseated himself at the dinner table. He fell greedily upon his\nbacon, and swallowed his potatoes whole instead of bread. La Teuse,\nhowever, could not persuade Desiree to finish her dinner. That big baby\nwas lost in ecstasy over the nestlings, asking questions, wanting to\nknow what food they ate, if they laid eggs, and how the cockbirds could\nbe known.\n\nThe old servant, however, was troubled by a suspicion, and taking her\nstand on her sound leg, she looked the young cure in the face.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098So you know the Paradou people?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said.\n\nThereupon he simply told the truth, relating the visit he had paid to\nold Jeanbernat. La Teuse exchanged scandalised glances with Brother\nArchangias. At first she answered nothing, but went round and round the\ntable, limping frantically and stamping hard enough with her heels to\nsplit the flooring.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You might have spoken to me of those people these three months past,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nsaid the priest at last. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I should have known at any rate what sort of\npeople I was going to call upon.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nLa Teuse stopped short as if her legs had just broken.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell falsehoods, Monsieur le Cure,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she stuttered, \u00e2\u0080\u0098don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell\nthem; you will only make your sin still worse. How dare you say I\nhaven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t spoken to you of the Philosopher, that heathen who is the\nscandal of the whole neighbourhood? The truth is, you never listen to me\nwhen I talk. It all goes in at one ear and out at the other. Ah, if you\ndid listen to me, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d spare yourself a good deal of trouble!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I, too, have spoken to you about those abominations,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 affirmed the\nBrother.\n\nAbbe Mouret lightly shrugged his shoulders. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remember\nit,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said. It was only when I found myself at the Paradou that I\nfancied I recollected certain tales. Besides, I should have gone to that\nunhappy man all the same as I thought him in danger of death.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBrother Archangias, his mouth full, struck the table violently with his\nknife, and roared: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Jeanbernat is a dog; he ought to die like a dog.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nThen seeing the priest about to protest he cut him short: \u00e2\u0080\u0098No, no, for\nhim there is no God, no penitence, no mercy. It would be better to throw\nthe host to the pigs than carry it to that scoundrel.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen he helped himself to more potatoes, and with his elbows on the\ntable, his chin in his plate, began chewing furiously. La Teuse, her\nlips pinched, quite white with anger, contented herself with saying\ndryly: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Let it be, his reverence will have his own way. He has secrets\nfrom us now.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nSilence reigned. For a moment one only heard the working of Brother\nArchangias\u00e2\u0080\u0099s jaws, and the extraordinary rumbling of his gullet.\nDesiree, with her bare arms round the nest in her plate, smiled to the\nlittle ones, talking to them slowly and softly in a chirruping of her\nown which they seemed to understand.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098People say what they have done when they have nothing to hide,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nsuddenly cried La Teuse.\n\nAnd then silence reigned again. What exasperated the old servant was the\nmystery the priest seemed to make about his visit to the Paradou. She\ndeemed herself a woman who had been shamefully deceived. Her curiosity\nsmarted. She again walked round the table, not looking at the Abbe, not\naddressing anybody, but comforting herself with soliloquy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it; that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why we have lunch so late! We go gadding about till\ntwo o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock in the afternoon. We go into such disreputable houses that\nwe don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even dare to tell what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done. And then we tell lies, we\ndeceive everybody.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But nobody,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 gently interrupted Abbe Mouret, who was forcing himself to\neat a little more, so as to prevent La Teuse from getting crosser than\never, \u00e2\u0080\u0098nobody asked me if I had been to the Paradou. I have not had to\ntell any lies.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nLa Teuse, however, went on as if she had never heard him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes, we go ruining our cassock in the dust, we come home rigged up like\na thief. And if some kind person takes an interest in us, and\nquestions us for our own good, we push her about and treat her like\na good-for-nothing woman, whom we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t trust. We hide things like\na slyboots, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d rather die than breathe a word; we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not even\nconsiderate enough to enliven our home by relating what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe turned to the priest, and looked him full in the face.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes, you take that to yourself. You are a close one, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a bad man!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThereupon she fell to crying and the Abbe had to soothe her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Monsieur Caffin used to tell me everything,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she moaned out.\n\nHowever, she soon grew calmer. Brother Archangias was finishing a big\npiece of cheese, apparently quite unruffled by the scene. In his opinion\nAbbe Mouret really needed being kept straight, and La Teuse was right\nin making him feel the reins. Having drunk a last glassful of the weak\nwine, the Brother threw himself back in his chair to digest his meal.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well now,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 finally asked the old servant, \u00e2\u0080\u0098what did you see at the\nParadou? Tell us, at any rate.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAbbe Mouret smiled and related in a few words how strangely Jeanbernat\nhad received him. La Teuse, after overwhelming him with questions, broke\nout into indignant exclamations, while Brother Archangias clenched his\nfists and brandished them aloft.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098May Heaven crush him!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said he, \u00e2\u0080\u0098and burn both him and his witch!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nIn his turn the Abbe then endeavoured to elicit some fresh particulars\nabout the people at the Paradou, and listened intently to the Brother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nmonstrous narrative.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes, that little she-devil came and sat down in the school. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a long\ntime ago now, she might then have been about ten. Of course, I let\nher come; I thought her uncle was sending her to prepare for her first\ncommunion. But for two months she utterly revolutionised the whole\nclass. She made herself worshipped, the minx! She knew all sorts of\ngames, and invented all sorts of finery with leaves and shreds of rags.\nAnd how quick and clever she was, too, like all those children of hell!\nShe was the top one at catechism. But one fine morning the old man burst\nin just in the middle of our lessons. He was going to smash everything,\nand shouted that the priests had taken his child from him. We had to get\nthe rural policeman to turn him out. As to the little one, she bolted.\nI could see her through the window, in a field opposite, laughing at her\nuncle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s frenzy. She had been coming to school for the last two months\nwithout his even suspecting it. He had regularly scoured the country\nafter her.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s never taken her first communion,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed La Teuse below her\nbreath with a slight shudder.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No, never,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 rejoined Brother Archangias. \u00e2\u0080\u0098She must be sixteen now.\nShe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s growing up like a brute beast. I have seen her running on all\nfours in a thicket near La Palud.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098On all fours,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 muttered the servant, turning towards the window with\nsuperstitious anxiety.\n\nAbbe Mouret attempted to express some doubt, but the Brother burst out:\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes, on all fours! And she jumped like a wild cat. If I had only had\na gun I could have put a bullet in her. We kill creatures that are far\nmore pleasing to God than she is. Besides, every one knows she comes\ncaterwauling every night round Les Artaud. She howls like a beast. If\never a man should fall into her clutches, she wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t leave him a scrap\nof skin on his bones, I know.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe Brother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hatred of womankind was boiling over. He banged the table\nwith his fist, and poured forth all his wonted abuse.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The devil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in them. They reek of the devil! And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what bewitches\nfools.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe priest nodded approvingly. Brother Archangias\u00e2\u0080\u0099s outrageous violence\nand La Teuse\u00e2\u0080\u0099s loquacious tyranny were like castigation with thongs,\nwhich it often rejoiced him to find lashing his shoulders. He took a\npious delight in sinking into abasement beneath their coarse speech.\nHe seemed to see the peace of heaven behind contempt of the world\nand degradation of his whole being. It was delicious to inflict\nmortification upon his body, to drag his susceptible nature through a\ngutter.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There is nought but filth,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he muttered as he folded up his napkin.\n\nLa Teuse began to clear the table and wished to remove the plate on\nwhich Desiree had laid the blackbird\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nest. You are not going to bed\nhere, I suppose, mademoiselle,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Do leave those nasty things.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nDesiree, however, defended her plate. She covered the nest with her bare\narms, no longer gay, but cross at being disturbed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I hope those birds are not going to be kept,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed Brother\nArchangias. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It would bring bad luck. You must wring their necks.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAnd he already stretched out his big hands; but the girl rose and\nstepped back quivering, hugging the nest to her bosom. She stared\nfixedly at the Brother, her lips curling upwards, like those of a wolf\nabout to bite.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t touch the little things,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she stammered. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You are ugly.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nWith such singular contempt did she emphasise that last word that Abbe\nMouret started as if the Brother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ugliness had just struck him for the\nfirst time. The latter contented himself with growling. He had always\nfelt a covert hatred for Desiree, whose lusty physical development\noffended him. When she had left the room, still walking backwards, and\nnever taking her eyes from him, he shrugged his shoulders and muttered\nbetween his teeth some coarse abuse which no one heard.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098She had better go to bed,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said La Teuse. \u00e2\u0080\u0098She would only bore us\nby-and-by in church.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Has any one come yet?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 asked Abbe Mouret.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh, the girls have been outside a long time with armfuls of boughs. I\nam just going to light the lamps. We can begin whenever you like.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nA few seconds later she could be heard swearing in the sacristy because\nthe matches were damp. Brother Archangias, who remained alone with the\npriest, sourly inquired: \u00e2\u0080\u0098For the month of Mary, eh?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied Abbe Mouret. \u00e2\u0080\u0098The last few days the girls about here were\nhard at work and couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come as usual to decorate the Lady Chapel. So\nthe ceremony was postponed till to-night.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098A nice custom,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 muttered the Brother. \u00e2\u0080\u0098When I see them all putting up\ntheir boughs I feel inclined to knock them down and make them confess\ntheir misdeeds before touching the altar. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a shame to allow women to\nrustle their dresses so near the holy relics.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe Abbe made an apologetic gesture. He had only been at Les Artaud a\nlittle while, he must follow the customs.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Whenever you like, Monsieur le Cure, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re ready!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 now called out La\nTeuse.\n\nBut Brother Archangias detained him a minute. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I am off,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Religion isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a prostitute that it should be decorated with flowers\nand laces.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe walked slowly to the door. Then once more he stopped, and lifting one\nof his hairy fingers added: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Beware of your devotion to the Virgin.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\n\n\nXIII\n\nOn entering the church Abbe Mouret found nine or ten big girls awaiting\nhim with boughs of ivy, laurel, and rosemary. Few garden flowers grew\non the rocks of Les Artaud, so the custom was to decorate the Lady altar\nwith a greenery which might last throughout the month of May. Thereto\nLa Teuse would add a few wallflowers whose stems were thrust into old\ndecanters.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Will you let me do it, Monsieur le Cure?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she asked. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You are not used\nto it---- Come, stand there in front of the altar. You can tell me if\nthe decorations please you.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe consented, and it was she who really directed the arrangements.\nHaving climbed upon a pair of steps she bullied the girls as they came\nup to her in turn with their leafy contributions.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Not so fast, now! You must give me time to fix the boughs. We can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nhave all these bundles coming down on his reverence\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head---- Come on,\nBabet, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your turn. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the good of staring at me like that with\nyour big eyes? Fine rosemary yours is, my word! as yellow as a thistle.\nYou next, La Rousse. Ah, well, that is splendid laurel! You got that out\nof your field at Croix-Verte, I know.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe big girls laid their branches on the altar, which they kissed; and\nthere they lingered for a while, handing up the greenery to La Teuse.\nThe sly look of devotion they had assumed on stepping on to the altar\nsteps was quickly set aside, and soon they were laughing, digging each\nother with their knees, swaying their hips against the altar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s edge, and\nthrusting their bosoms against the tabernacle itself. Over them the tall\nVirgin in gilded plaster bent her tinted face, and smiled with her rosy\nlips upon the naked Jesus she bore upon her left arm.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it, Lisa!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cried La Teuse; \u00e2\u0080\u0098why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you sit on the altar while\nyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re about it? Just pull your petticoats straight, will you? Aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nyou ashamed of behaving like that?--If any one of you lolls about I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\nlay her boughs across her face.--Can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you hand me the things quietly?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen turning round, she asked:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Do you like it, sir? Do you think it will do?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe had converted the space behind the Virgin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s statue into a verdant\nniche, whence leafy sprays projected on either side, forming a bower,\nand drooping over in front like palm leaves. The priest expressed his\napproval, but ventured to remark: \u00e2\u0080\u0098I think there ought to be a cluster\nof more delicate foliage up above.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No doubt,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 grumbled La Teuse. \u00e2\u0080\u0098But they only bring me laurel and\nrosemary--I should like to know who has brought an olive branch. Not\none, you bet! They are afraid of losing a single olive, the heathens!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAt this, however, Catherine came up laden with an enormous olive bough\nwhich completely hid her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got some, you minx!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 continued the old servant.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Of course,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 one of the other girls exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u0098she stole it. I saw\nVincent breaking it off while she kept a look-out.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut Catherine flew into a rage and swore it was not true. She turned,\nand thrusting her auburn head through the greenery, which she still\ntightly held, she started lying with marvellous assurance, inventing\nquite a long story to prove that the olive bough was really hers.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Besides,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she added, \u00e2\u0080\u0098all the trees belong to the Blessed Virgin.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAbbe Mouret was about to intervene, but La Teuse sharply inquired if\nthey wanted to make game of her and keep her arms up there all night.\nAt last she proceeded to fasten the olive bough firmly, while Catherine,\nholding on to the steps behind her, mimicked the clumsy manner in which\nshe turned her huge person about with the help of her sound leg. Even\nthe priest could not forbear to smile.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said La Teuse, as she came down and stood beside him to get\na good view of her work, \u00e2\u0080\u0098there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the top done. Now we will put some\nclumps between the candlesticks, unless you would prefer a garland all\nalong the altar shelf.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe priest decided in favour of some big clumps.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Very good; come on, then,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 continued the old servant, once more\nclambering up the steps. \u00e2\u0080\u0098We can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go to bed here. Just kiss the altar,\nwill you, Miette? Do you fancy you are in your stable? Monsieur le Cure,\ndo just see what they are up to over there! I can hear them laughing\nlike lunatics.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nOn raising one of the two lamps the dark end of the church was lit up\nand three of the girls were discovered romping about under the gallery;\none of them had stumbled and pitched head foremost into the holy water\nstoup, which mishap had so tickled the others that they were rolling on\nthe ground to laugh at their ease. They all came back, however, looking\nat the priest sheepishly, with lowered eyelids, but with their hands\nswinging against their hips as if a scolding rather pleased them than\notherwise.\n\nHowever, the measure of La Teuse\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wrath was filled when she suddenly\nperceived Rosalie coming up to the altar like the others with a bundle\nof boughs in her arms.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Get down, will you?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she cried to her. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You are a cool one, and no\nmistake, my lass!--Hurry up, off you go with your bundle.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What for, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to know?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Rosalie boldly. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say I have\nstolen it.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe other girls drew closer, feigning innocence and exchanging sparkling\nglances.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Clear out,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 repeated La Teuse, \u00e2\u0080\u0098you have no business here, do you\nhear?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen, quite losing her scanty patience, she gave vent to a very coarse\nepithet, which provoked a titter of delight among the peasant girls.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, what next?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Rosalie. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Mind your own business. Is it any\nconcern of yours?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen she burst into a fit of sobbing and threw down her boughs, but let\nthe Abbe lead her aside and give her a severe lecture. He had already\ntried to silence La Teuse; for he was beginning to feel uneasy amidst\nthe big shameless hussies who filled the church with their armfuls of\nfoliage. They were pushing right up to the altar step, enclosing him\nwith a belt of woodland, wafting in his face a rank perfume of aromatic\nshoots.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Let us make haste, be quick!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he exclaimed, clapping his hands lightly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Goodness knows I would rather be in my bed,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 grumbled La Teuse. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nnot so easy as you think to fasten all these bits of stuff.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nFinally, however, she succeeded in setting some lofty plumes of foliage\nbetween the candlesticks. Next she folded the steps, which were laid\nbehind the high altar by Catherine. And then she only had to arrange\ntwo clumps of greenery at the sides of the altar table. The last boughs\nsufficed for this, and indeed there were some left which the girls\nstrewed over the sanctuary floor up to the wooden rails. The Lady altar\nnow looked like a grove, a shrubbery with a verdant lawn before it.\n\nAt present La Teuse was willing to make way for Abbe Mouret, who\nascended the altar steps, and, again lightly clapping his hands,\nexclaimed: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Young ladies, to-morrow we will continue the devotions of\nthe month of Mary. Those who may be unable to come ought at least to say\ntheir Rosary at home.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe knelt, and the peasant girls, with a mighty rustle of skirts, sank\ndown and settled themselves on their heels. They followed his prayer\nwith a confused muttering, through which burst here and there a giggle.\nOne of them, on being pinched from behind, burst into a scream, which\nshe attempted to stifle with a sudden fit of coughing; and this so\ndiverted the others that for a moment after the Amen they remained\nwrithing with merriment, their noses close to the stone flags.\n\nLa Teuse dismissed them; while the priest, after crossing himself,\nremained absorbed before the altar, no longer hearing what went on\nbehind him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Come, now, clear out,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 muttered the old woman. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a pack of\ngood-for-nothings, who can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even respect God. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shameful, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nunheard of, for girls to roll about on the floor in church like beasts\nin a meadow---- What are you doing there, La Rousse? If I see you\npinching any one, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to deal with me! Oh, yes, you may put out\nyour tongue at me; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell his reverence about it. Out you get; out\nyou get, you minxes!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe drove them slowly towards the door, while running and bobbling round\nthem frantically. And she had succeeded, as she thought, in getting\nevery one of them outside, when she caught sight of Catherine and\nVincent calmly installed in the confessional, where they were eating\nsomething with an air of great enjoyment. She drove them away; and as\nshe popped her head outside the church, before closing the door, she\nespied Rosalie throwing her arm over the shoulder of Fortune, who had\nbeen waiting for her. The pair of them vanished in the darkness amid a\nfaint sound of kisses.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098To think that such creatures dare to come to our Lady\u00e2\u0080\u0099s altar!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 La\nTeuse stuttered as she shot the bolts. \u00e2\u0080\u0098The others are no better, I am\nsure. If they came to-night with their boughs, it was only for a bit of\nfun and to get kissed by the lads on going off! Not one of them will\nput herself out of the way to-morrow; his reverence will have to say\nhis _Aves_ by himself---- We shall only see the jades who have got\nassignations.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThus soliloquising, she thrust the chairs back into their places, and\nlooked round to see if anything suspicious was lying about before\ngoing off to bed. In the confessional she picked up a handful of\napple-parings, which she threw behind the high altar. And she also found\na bit of ribbon torn from some cap, and a lock of black hair, which she\nmade up into a small parcel, with the view of opening an inquiry into\nthe matter. With these exceptions the church seemed to her tidy. There\nwas oil enough for the night in the bracket-lamp of the sanctuary,\nand as to the flags of the choir, they could do without washing till\nSaturday.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nearly ten o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, Monsieur le Cure,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said, drawing near the\npriest, who was still on his knees. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You might as well come up now.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe made no answer, but only bowed his head.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098All right, I know what that means,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 continued La Teuse. \u00e2\u0080\u0098In\nanother hour he will still be on the stones there, giving himself a\nstomach-ache. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m off, as I shall only bore him. All the same, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nsee much sense in it, eating one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lunch when others are at dinner,\nand going to bed when the fowls get up!---- I worry you, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t I, your\nreverence? Good-night. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not at all reasonable!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe made ready to go, but suddenly came back to put out one of the two\nlamps, muttering the while that such late prayers spelt ruination in\noil. Then, at last, she did go off, after passing her sleeve brushwise\nover the cloth of the high altar, which seemed to her grey with dust.\nAbbe Mouret, his eyes uplifted, his arms tightly clasped against his\nbreast, then remained alone.\n\n\n\n\nXIV\n\nWith only one lamp burning amid the verdure on the altar of the Virgin,\nhuge floating shadows filled the church at either end. From the pulpit a\nsheet of gloom projected to the rafters of the ceiling. The confessional\nlooked quite black under the gallery, showing strange outlines\nsuggestive of a ruined sentry-box. All the light, softened and tinted as\nit were by the green foliage, rested slumberingly upon the tall gilded\nVirgin, who seemed to descend with queenly mien, borne upon the cloud\nround which gambolled the winged cherubim. At sight of that round lamp\ngleaming amid the boughs one might have thought the pallid moon\nwas rising on the verge of a wood, casting its light upon a regal\napparition, a princess of heaven, crowned and clothed with gold, who\nwith her nude and Divine Infant had come to stroll in the mysterious\nwoodland avenues. Between the leaves, along the lofty plumes of\ngreenery, within the large ogival arbour, and even along the branches\nstrewing the flagstones, star-like beams glided drowsily, like the milky\nrain of light that filters through the bushes on moonlit nights. Vague\nsounds and creakings came from the dusky ends of the church; the\nlarge clock on the left of the chancel throbbed slowly, with the heavy\nbreathing of a machine asleep. And the radiant vision, the Mother with\nslender bands of chestnut hair, as if reassured by the nocturnal quiet\nof the nave, came lower and lower, scarce bending the blades of grass in\nthe clearings beneath the gentle flight of her cloudy chariot.\n\nAbbe Mouret gazed at her. This was the hour when he most loved the\nchurch. He forgot the woeful figure on the cross, the Victim bedaubed\nwith carmine and ochre, who gasped out His life behind him, in the\nchapel of the Dead. His thoughts were no longer distracted by the garish\nlight from the windows, by the gayness of morning coming in with the\nsun, by the irruption of outdoor life--the sparrows and the boughs\ninvading the nave through the shattered panes. At that hour of night\nNature was dead; shadows hung the whitewashed walls with crape; a chill\nfell upon his shoulders like a salutary penance-shirt. He could now\nwholly surrender himself to the supremest love, without fear of any\nflickering ray of light, any caressing breeze or scent, any buzzing of\nan insect\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wing disturbing him amidst the delight of loving. Never\nhad his morning mass afforded him the superhuman joys of his nightly\nprayers.\n\nWith quivering lips Abbe Mouret now gazed at the tall Virgin. He\ncould see her coming towards him from the depths of her green bower in\never-increasing splendour. No longer did a flood of moonlight seem to\nfloat across the tree-tops. She seemed to him clothed with the sun; she\nadvanced majestically, glorious, colossal, and so all-powerful that he\nwas tempted at times to cast himself face downwards to shun the flaming\nsplendour of that gate opening into heaven. Then, amidst the adoration\nof his whole being, which stayed his words upon his lips, he remembered\nBrother Archangias\u00e2\u0080\u0099s final rebuke, as he might have remembered words\nof blasphemy. The Brother often reproved him for his devotion to the\nVirgin, which he declared was veritable robbery of devotion due to\nGod. In the Brother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opinion it enervated the soul, put religion\ninto petticoats, created and fostered a state of sentimentalism quite\nunworthy of the strong. He bore the Virgin a grudge for her womanhood,\nher beauty, her maternity; he was ever on his guard against her,\npossessed by a covert fear of feeling tempted by her gracious mien, of\nsuccumbing to her seductive sweetness. \u00e2\u0080\u0098She will lead you far!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he had\ncried one day to the young priest, for in her he saw the commencement\nof human passion. From contemplating her one might glide to delight in\nlovely chestnut hair, in large bright eyes, and the mystery of garments\nfalling from neck to toes. His was the blunt rebellion of a saint who\nroughly parted the Mother from the Son, asking as He did: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Woman, what\nhave we in common, thou and I?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut Abbe Mouret thrust away such thoughts, prostrated himself,\nendeavoured to forget the Brother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s harsh attacks. His rapture in the\nimmaculate purity of Mary alone raised him from the depths of lowliness\nin which he sought to bury himself. Whenever, alone before the tall\ngolden Virgin, he so deceived himself as to imagine that he could see\nher bending down for him to kiss her braided locks, he once more became\nvery young, very good, very strong, very just, full of tenderness.\n\nAbbe Mouret\u00e2\u0080\u0099s devotion to the Virgin dated from his early youth. Already\nwhen he was quite a child, somewhat shy and fond of shrinking into\ncorners, he took pleasure in the thought that a lovely lady was watching\nover him: that two blue eyes, so sweet, ever followed him with their\nsmile. When he felt at night a breath of air glide across his hair, he\nwould often say that the Virgin had come to kiss him. He had grown up\nbeneath this womanly caress, in an atmosphere full of the rustle of\ndivine robes. From the age of seven he had satisfied the cravings of his\naffection by expending all the pence he received as pocket money in the\npurchase of pious picture-cards, which he jealously concealed that he\nalone might feast on them. But never was he tempted by the pictures of\nJesus and the Lamb, of Christ on the Cross, of God the Father, with a\nmighty beard, stooping over a bank of clouds; his preference was always\nfor the winning portraits of Mary, with her tiny smiling mouth and\ndelicate outstretched hands. By degrees he had made quite a collection\nof them all--of Mary between a lily and a distaff, Mary carrying her\nchild as if she were his elder sister, Mary crowned with roses, and\nMary crowned with stars. For him they formed a family of lovely young\nmaidens, alike in their attractiveness, in the grace, kindliness, and\nsweetness of their countenances, so youthful beneath their veils, that\nalthough they bore the name of \u00e2\u0080\u0098Mother of God,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he had felt no awe of\nthem as he had often felt for grown-up persons.\n\nThey seemed to him of his own age, little girls such as he wished to\nmeet with, little girls of heaven such as the little boys who die when\nseven years old have for eternal playmates in some nook of Paradise. But\neven at this early age he was self-contained; and full of the exquisite\nbashfulness of adolescence he grew up without betraying the secret of\nhis religious love. Mary grew up with him, being invariably a year or\ntwo older than himself, as should always be the case with one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chiefest\nfriend. When he was eighteen, she was twenty; she no longer kissed his\nforehead at night time, but stood a little further from him with folded\narms, chastely smiling, ravishingly sweet. And he--he only named her now\nin a whisper, feeling as if he would faint each time the well-loved name\npassed his lips in prayer. No more did he dream of childish games within\nthe garden of heaven, but of continual contemplation before that white\nfigure, whose perfect purity he feared to sully with his breath. Even\nfrom his own mother did he conceal the fervour of his love for Mary.\n\nThen, a few years later, at the seminary, his beautiful affection for\nher, seemingly so just, so natural, was disturbed by inward qualms.\nWas the cult of Mary necessary for salvation? Was he not robbing God\nby giving Mary a part, the greater part, of his love, his thoughts, his\nheart, his entire being? Perplexing questions were these, provoking an\ninward struggle which increased his passion, riveted his bonds. For he\ndived into all the subtleties of his affection, found unknown joys\nin discussing the lawfulness of his feelings. The books treating of\ndevotion to the Virgin brought him excuses, joyful raptures, a wealth of\narguments which he repeated with prayerful fervour. From them he learned\nhow, in Mary, to be the slave of Jesus. He went to Jesus through Mary.\nHe cited all kinds of proofs, he discriminated, he drew inferences.\nMary, whom Jesus had obeyed on earth, should be obeyed by all mankind;\nMary still retained her maternal power in heaven, where she was the\ngreat dispenser of God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s treasures, the only one who could beseech Him,\nthe only one who allotted the heavenly thrones; and thus Mary, a mere\ncreature before God, but raised up to Him, became the human link between\nheaven and earth, the intermediary of every grace, of every mercy; and\nhis conclusion always was that she should be loved above all else in God\nhimself. Another time he was attracted by more complicated theological\ncuriosities: the marriage of the celestial spouse, the Holy Ghost\nsealing the Vase of Election, making of the Virgin Mary an everlasting\nmiracle, offering her inviolable purity to the devotion of mankind. She\nwas the Virgin overcoming all heresies, the irreconcilable foe of Satan,\nthe new Eve of whom it had been foretold that she should crush the\nSerpent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head, the august Gate of Grace, by which the Saviour had\nalready entered once and through which He would come again at the Last\nDay--a vague prophecy, allotting a yet larger future role to Mary, which\nthrew Serge into a dreamy imagining of some immense expansion of divine\nlove.\n\nThis entry of woman into the jealous, cruel heaven depicted by the\nOld Testament, this figure of whiteness set at the feet of the awesome\nTrinity, appeared to him the very grace itself of religion, the one\nconsolation for all the dread inspired by things of faith, the one\nrefuge when he found himself lost amidst the mysteries of dogma. And\nwhen he had thus proved to himself, point by point, that she was the way\nto Jesus--easy, short, perfect, and certain--he surrendered himself anew\nto her, wholly and without remorse: he strove to be her true devotee,\ndead to self and steeped in submission.\n\nIt was an hour of divine voluptuousness! The books treating of devotion\nto the Virgin burned his hands. They spoke to him in a language of love,\nwarm, fragrant as incense. Mary no longer seemed a young maiden veiled\nin white, standing with crossed arms, a foot or two away from his\npillow. She came surrounded by splendour, even as John saw her, clothed\nwith the sun, crowned with twelve stars, and having the moon beneath her\nfeet. She perfumed him with her fragrance, inflamed him with longing for\nheaven, ravished him even with the ardent glow of the planets flaming on\nher brow. He threw himself before her and called himself her slave. No\nword could have been sweeter than that word of slave, which he repeated,\nwhich he relished yet more and more as it trembled on his stammering\ntongue, whilst casting himself at her feet--to become her thing, her\nmite, the dust lightly scattered by the waving of her azure robe. With\nDavid he exclaimed: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Mary is made for me,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and with the Evangelist\nhe added: \u00e2\u0080\u0098I have taken her for my all.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 He called her his \u00e2\u0080\u0098beloved\nmistress,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 for words failed him, and he fell into the prattle of child\nor lover, his breath breaking with intensity of passion. She was the\nBlessed among women, the Queen of Heaven glorified by the nine Choirs\nof Angels, the Mother of Predilection, the Treasure of the Lord. All the\nvivid imagery of her cult unrolled itself before him comparing to her an\nearthly paradise of virgin soil, with beds of flowering virtues, green\nmeadows of hope, impregnable towers of strength, and smiling dwellings\nof confidence. Again she was a fountain sealed by the Holy Ghost, a\nshrine and dwelling-place of the Holy Trinity, the Throne of God, the\nCity of God, the Altar of God, the Temple of God, and the World of God.\nAnd he walked in that garden, in its shade, its sunlight, beneath its\nenchanting greenery; he sighed after the water of that Fountain; he\ndwelt within Mary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beauteous precincts--resting, hiding, heedlessly\nstraying there, drinking in the milk of infinite love that fell drop by\ndrop from her virginal bosom.\n\nEvery morning, on rising at the seminary, he greeted Mary with a hundred\nbows, his face turned towards the strip of sky visible from his window.\nAnd at night in like fashion he bade her farewell with his eyes fixed\nupon the stars. Often, when he thus gazed out on fine bright nights,\nwhen Venus gleamed golden and dreamy through the warm atmosphere, he\nforgot himself, and then, like a soft song, would fall from his lips the\n_Ave maris Stella_, that tender hymn which set before his eyes a distant\nazure land, and a tranquil sea, scarce wrinkled by a caressing quiver,\nand illuminated by a smiling star, a very sun in size. He recited, too,\nthe _Salve Regina_, the _Regina Coeli_, the _O gloriosa Domina_, all the\nprayers and all the canticles. He would read the Office of the Virgin,\nthe holy books written in her honour, the little Psalter of St.\nBonaventura, with such devout tenderness, that he could not turn the\nleaves for tears. He fasted and mortified himself, that he might offer\nup to her his bruised and wounded flesh. Ever since the age of ten he\nhad worn her livery--the holy scapular, the twofold image of Mary sewn\non squares of cloth, whose warmth upon his chest and back thrilled him\nwith delight. Later on, he also took to wearing the little chain in\ntoken of his loving slavery. But his greatest act of love was ever the\nAngelic Salutation, the _Ave Maria_, his heart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s perfect prayer. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Hail,\nMary----\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and he saw her advancing towards him, full of grace, blessed\namongst women; and he cast his heart at her feet for her to tread on it\nin sweetness. He multiplied and repeated that salutation in a hundred\ndifferent ways, ever seeking some more efficacious one. He would say\ntwelve _Aves_ to commemorate the crown of twelve stars that encircled\nMary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brow; he would say fourteen in remembrance of her fourteen joys;\nat another time he would recite seven decades of them in honour of the\nyears she lived on earth. For hours the beads of his Rosary would\nglide between his fingers. Then, again, on certain days of mystical\nassignation he would launch into the endless muttering of the Rosary.\n\nWhen, alone in his cell, with time to give to his love, he knelt upon\nthe floor, the whole of Mary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s garden with its lofty flowers of chastity\nblossomed around him. Between his fingers glided the Rosary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wreath of\n_Aves_, intersected by _Paters_, like a garland of white roses mingled\nwith the lilies of the Annunciation, the blood-hued flowers of Calvary,\nand the stars of the Coronation. He would slowly tread those fragrant\npaths, pausing at each of the fifteen dizains of _Aves_, and dwelling on\nits corresponding mystery; he was beside himself with joy, or grief, or\ntriumph, according as the mystery belonged to one or other of the three\nseries--the joyful, the sorrowful, or the glorious. What an incomparable\nlegend it was, the history of Mary, a complete human life, with all its\nsmiles and tears and triumph, which he lived over again from end to end\nin a single moment! And first he entered into joy with the five glad\nMysteries, steeped in the serene calm of dawn. First the Archangel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nsalutation, the fertilising ray gliding down from heaven, fraught with\nthe spotless union\u00e2\u0080\u0099s adorable ecstasy; then the visit to Elizabeth on a\nbright hope-laden morn, when the fruit of Mary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s womb for the first time\nstirred and thrilled her with the shock at which mothers blench; then\nthe birth in a stable at Bethlehem, and the long string of shepherds\ncoming to pay homage to her Divine Maternity; then the new-born babe\ncarried into the Temple on the arms of his mother who smiled, still\nweary, but already happy at offering her child to God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s justice, to\nSimeon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s embrace, to the desires of the world; and lastly, Jesus at a\nlater age revealing Himself before the doctors, in whose midst He is\nfound by His anxious mother, now proud and comforted.\n\nBut, after that tender radiant dawn, it seemed to Serge as if the sky\nwere suddenly overcast. His feet now trod on brambles, the beads of the\nRosary pricked his fingers; he cowered beneath the horror of the five\nSorrowful Mysteries: Mary, agonising in her Son in the garden of Olives,\nsuffering with Him from the scourging, feeling on her own brow the\nwounds made by the crown of thorns, bearing the fearful weight of His\nCross, and dying at his feet on Calvary. Those inevitable sufferings,\nthat harrowing martyrdom of the queen he worshipped, and for whom\nhe would have shed his blood like Jesus, roused in him a feeling of\nshuddering repulsion which ten years\u00e2\u0080\u0099 practice of the same prayers and\nthe same devotions had failed to weaken. But as the beads flowed on,\nlight suddenly burst upon the darkness of the Crucifixion, and the\nresplendent glory of the five last Mysteries shone forth in all the\nbrightness of a cloudless sun. Mary was transfigured, and sang the\nhallelujah of the Resurrection, the victory over Death and the eternity\nof life. With outstretched hands, and dazed with admiration, she beheld\nthe triumph of her Son ascending into heaven on golden clouds, fringed\nwith purple. She gathered the Apostles round her, and, as on the day\nof her conception, participated in the glow of the Spirit of Love,\ndescending now in tongues of fire. She, too, was carried up to heaven\nby a flight of angels, borne aloft on their white wings like a spotless\nark, and tenderly set down amid the splendour of the heavenly thrones;\nand there, in her supreme glory, amidst a splendour so dazzling that\nthe light of the sun was quenched, God crowned her with the stars of the\nfirmament. Impassioned love has but one word. In reciting a hundred and\nfifty _Aves_ Serge had not once repeated himself. The monotonous murmur,\nthe ever recurring words, akin to the \u00e2\u0080\u0098I love you\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of lovers, assumed\neach time a deeper and deeper meaning; and he lingered over it all,\nexpressed everything with the aid of the one solitary Latin sentence,\nand learned to know Mary through and through, until, as the last bead of\nhis Rosary slipped from his hand, his heart grew faint with the thought\nof parting from her.\n\nMany a night had the young man spent in this way. Daybreak had found\nhim still murmuring his prayers. It was the moon, he would say to cheat\nhimself, that was making the stars wane. His superiors had to reprove\nhim for those vigils, which left him languid and pale as if he had been\nlosing blood. On the wall of his cell had long hung a coloured engraving\nof the Sacred Heart of Mary, an engraving which showed the Virgin\nsmiling placidly, throwing open her bodice, and revealing a crimson\nfissure, wherein glowed her heart, pierced with a sword, and crowned\nwith white roses. That sword tormented him beyond measure, brought him\nan intolerable horror of suffering in woman, the very thought of which\nscattered his pious submissiveness to the winds. He erased the weapon,\nand left only the crowned and flaming heart which seemed to be half torn\nfrom that exquisite flesh, as if tendered as an offering to himself. And\nit was then he felt beloved: Mary was giving him her heart, her living\nheart, even as it throbbed in her bosom, dripping with her rosy blood.\n\nIn all this there was no longer the imagery of devout passion, but a\nmaterial entity, a prodigy of affection which impelled him, when he was\npraying before the engraving, to open out his hands in order that he\nmight reverently receive the heart that leaped from that immaculate\nbosom. He could see it, hear it beat; he was loved, that heart was\nbeating for himself! His whole being quickened with rapture; he would\nfain have kissed that heart, have melted in it, have lain beside it\nwithin the depths of that open breast. Mary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s love for him was an active\none; she desired him to be near her, to be wholly hers in the eternity\nto come; her love was efficacious, too, she was ever solicitous for him,\nwatching over him everywhere, guarding him from the slightest breach of\nhis fidelity. She loved him tenderly, more than the whole of womankind\ntogether, with a love as azure, as deep, as boundless as the sky itself.\nWhere could he ever find so delightful a mistress? What earthly caress\ncould be compared to the air in which he moved, the breath of Mary? What\nmundane union or enjoyment could be weighed against that everlasting\nflower of desire which grew unceasingly, and yet was never over-blown?\nAt this thought the _Magnificat_ would exhale from his mouth, like a\ncloud of incense. He sang the joyful song of Mary, her thrill of joy at\nthe approach of her Divine Spouse. He glorified the Lord who overthrew\nthe mighty from their thrones, and who sent Mary to him, poor destitute\nchild that he was, dying of love on the cold tiled floor of his cell.\n\nAnd when he had given all up to Mary--his body, his soul, his earthly\ngoods, and spiritual chattels--when he stood before her stripped, bare,\nwith all his prayers exhausted, there welled from his burning lips\nthe Virgin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s litanies, with their reiterated, persistent, impassioned\nappeals for heavenly succour. He fancied himself climbing a flight of\npious yearnings, which he ascended step by step at each bound of his\nheart. First he called her \u00e2\u0080\u0098Holy.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Next he called her \u00e2\u0080\u0098Mother,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 most\npure, most chaste, amiable, and admirable. And with fresh ardour he six\ntimes proclaimed her maidenhood; his lips cooled and freshened each time\nthat he pronounced that name of \u00e2\u0080\u0098Virgin,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 which he coupled with power,\ngoodness, and fidelity. And as his heart drew him higher up the ladder\nof light, a strange voice from his veins spoke within him, bursting into\ndazzling flowers of speech. He yearned to melt away in fragrance, to be\nspread around in light, to expire in a sigh of music. As he named her\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Mirror of Justice,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098Seat of Wisdom,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and \u00e2\u0080\u0098Source of Joy,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he could\nbehold himself pale with ecstasy in that mirror, kneeling on the warmth\nof the divine seat, quaffing intoxication in mighty draughts from the\nholy Source.\n\nAgain he would transform her, throwing off all restraint in his frantic\nlove, so as to attain to a yet closer union with her. She became a\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Vessel of Honour,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 chosen of God, a \u00e2\u0080\u0098Bosom of Election,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 wherein he\ndesired to pour his being, and slumber for ever.* She was the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Mystical\nRose\u00e2\u0080\u0099--a great flower which bloomed in Paradise, with petals formed of\nthe angels clustering round their queen, a flower so fresh, so fragrant,\nthat he could inhale its perfume from the depths of his unworthiness\nwith a joyful dilation of his sides which stretched them to bursting.\nShe became changed into a \u00e2\u0080\u0098House of Gold,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 a \u00e2\u0080\u0098Tower of David,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and a\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Tower of Ivory,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of inestimable richness, of a whiteness that swans\nmight envy, and of lofty, massive, rounded form, which he would\nfain have encircled with his outstretched arms as with a girdle of\nsubmissiveness. She stood on the distant skyline as the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Gate of\nHeaven,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 a glimpse of which he caught behind her shoulders when a puff\nof wind threw back the folds of her veil. She rose in splendour from\nbehind the mountain in the waning hour of night, like the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Morning Star\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nto help all travellers astray, like the very dawn of Love. And when he\nhad ascended to this height--scant of breath, yet still unsatiated--he\ncould only further glorify her with the title of \u00e2\u0080\u0098Queen,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 with which he\nnine times hailed her, as with nine parting salutations from the censer\nof his soul. His canticle died joyfully away in those last ejaculations\nof triumph: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Queen of virgins, Queen of all saints. Queen conceived\nwithout sin!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 She, ever before him, shone in splendour; and he, on\nthe topmost step, only reached by Mary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intimates, remained there yet\nanother moment, swooning amidst the subtle atmosphere around him; still\ntoo far away to kiss the edge of her azure robe, already feeling that\nhe was about to fall, but ever possessed by a desire to ascend again and\nagain, and seek that superhuman felicity.\n\n  * Curiously enough I find no trace of \u00e2\u0080\u0098Bosom of Election\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in the\n    Litany of the Blessed Virgin as printed in English Catholic\n    works.--ED.\n\nHow many times had not the Litany of the Virgin, recited in common in\nthe seminary chapel, left the young man with broken limbs and void head,\nas if from some great fall! And since his departure from the seminary,\nAbbe Mouret had grown to love the Virgin still more. He gave to her that\nimpassioned cult which to Brother Archangias savoured of heresy. In his\nopinion it was she who would save the Church by some matchless prodigy\nwhose near appearance would entrance the world. She was the only miracle\nof our impious age--the blue-robed lady that showed herself to little\nshepherdesses, the whiteness that gleamed at night between two clouds,\nher veil trailing over the low thatched roofs of peasant homes. When\nBrother Archangias coarsely asked him if he had ever espied her, he\nsimply smiled and tightened his lips as if to keep his secret. Truth to\nsay, he saw her every night. She no longer seemed a playful sister or a\nlovely pious maiden; she wore a bridal robe, with white flowers in\nher hair; and from beneath her drooping eyelids fell moist glances of\nhopeful promise that set his cheeks aglow. He could feel that she was\ncoming, that she was promising to delay no longer; that she said to him,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Here I am, receive me!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Thrice a day when the _Angelus_ rang out--at\nbreak of dawn, in the fulness of midday, and at the gentle fall of\ntwilight--he bared his head and said an _Ave_ with a glance around him\nas if to ascertain whether the bell were not at last announcing Mary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ncoming. He was five-and-twenty. He awaited her.\n\nDuring the month of May the young priest\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expectation was fraught with\njoyful hope. To La Teuse\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grumblings he no longer paid the slightest\nattention. If he remained so late praying in the church, it was because\nhe entertained the mad idea that the great golden Virgin would at last\ncome down from her pedestal. And yet he stood in awe of that Virgin, so\nlike a princess in her mien. He did not love all the Virgins alike, and\nthis one inspired him with supreme respect. She was, indeed, the\nMother of God, she showed the fertile development of form, the majestic\ncountenance, the strong arms of the Divine Spouse bearing Jesus. He\npictured her thus, standing in the midst of the heavenly court, the\ntrain of her royal mantle trailing among the stars; so far above him,\nand of such exceeding might, that he would be shattered into dust should\nshe deign to cast her eyes upon him. She was the Virgin of his days of\nweakness, the austere Virgin who restored his inward peace by an awesome\nglimpse of Paradise.\n\nThat night Abbe Mouret remained for over an hour on his knees in the\nempty church. With folded hands and eyes fixed on the golden Virgin\nrising planet-like amid the verdure, he sought the drowsiness of\necstasy, the appeasement of the strange discomfort he had felt that day.\nBut he failed to find the semi-somnolence of prayer with the delightful\nease he knew so well. However glorious and pure Mary might reveal\nherself, her motherhood, the maturity of her charms, and the bare infant\nshe bore upon her arm, disquieted him. It seemed as if in heaven itself\nthere were a repetition of the exuberant life, through which he had been\nmoving since the morning. Like the vines of the stony slopes, like the\ntrees of the Paradou, like the human troop of Artauds, Mary suggested\nthe blossoming, the begetting of life. Prayer came but slowly to his\nlips; fancies made his mind wander. He perceived things he had never\nseen before--the gentle wave of her chestnut hair, the rounded swell of\nher rosy throat. She had to assume a sterner air and overwhelm him with\nthe splendour of her sovereign power to bring him back to the unfinished\nsentences of his broken prayer. At last the sight of her golden crown,\nher golden mantle, all the golden sheen which made of her a mighty\nprincess, reduced him once more to slavish submission, and his prayer\nagain flowed evenly, and his mind became wrapped in worship.\n\nIn this ecstatic trance, half asleep, half awake, he remained till\neleven o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, heedless of his aching knees, fancying himself suspended\nin mid air, rocked to and fro like a child, and yielding to restful\nslumber, though conscious of some unknown weight that oppressed his\nheart. Meanwhile the church around him filled with shadows, the lamp\ngrew dim, and the lofty sprays of leafage darkened the tall Virgin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nvarnished face.\n\nWhen the clock, about to strike, gave out a rending whine, a shudder\npassed through Abbe Mouret. He had not hitherto felt the chill of the\nchurch upon his shoulders, but now he was shivering from head to foot.\nAs he crossed himself a memory swiftly flashed through the stupor of his\nwakening--the chattering of his teeth recalled to him the nights he had\nspent on the floor of his cell before the Sacred Heart of Mary, when his\nwhole frame would quiver with fever. He rose up painfully, displeased\nwith himself. As a rule, he would leave the altar untroubled in his\nflesh and with Mary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sweet breath still fresh upon his brow. That\nnight, however, as he took the lamp to go up to his room he felt as if\nhis throbbing temples were bursting. His prayer had not profited him;\nafter a transient alleviation he still experienced the burning glow\nwhich had been rising in his heart and brain since morning. When he\nreached the sacristy door, he turned and mechanically raised the lamp\nto take a last look at the tall Virgin. But she was now shrouded in the\ndeep shadows falling from the rafters, buried in the foliage around her\nwhence only the golden cross upon her crown emerged.\n\n\n\n\nXV\n\nAbbe Mouret\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bedroom, which occupied a corner of the vicarage, was a\nspacious one, having two large square windows; one of which opened above\nDesiree\u00e2\u0080\u0099s farmyard, whilst the other overlooked the village, the valley\nbeyond, the belt of hills, the whole landscape. The yellow-curtained\nbed, the walnut chest of drawers, and the three straw-bottomed chairs\nseemed lost below that lofty ceiling with whitewashed joists. A faint\ntartness, the somewhat musty odour of old country houses, ascended from\nthe tiled and ruddled floor that glistened like a mirror. On the chest\nof drawers a tall statuette of the Immaculate Conception rose greyly\nbetween some porcelain vases which La Teuse had filled with white lilac.\n\nAbbe Mouret set his lamp on the edge of the chest of drawers before the\nVirgin. He felt so unwell that he determined to light the vine-stem fire\nwhich was laid in readiness. He stood there, tongs in hand, watching\nthe kindling wood, his face illuminated by the flame. The house beneath\nslumbered in unbroken stillness. The silence filled his ears with a hum,\nwhich grew into a sound of whispering voices. Slowly and irresistibly\nthese voices mastered him and increased the feeling of anxiety which\nhad almost choked him several times that day. What could be the cause of\nsuch mental anguish? What could be the strange trouble which had slowly\ngrown within him and had now become so unbearable? He had not fallen\ninto sin. It seemed as if but yesterday he had left the seminary with\nall his ardent faith, and so fortified against the world that he moved\namong men beholding God alone. And, suddenly, he fancied himself in his\ncell at five o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock in the morning, the hour for rising. The deacon\non duty passed his door, striking it with his stick, and repeating the\nregulation summons--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098_Benedicamus Domino_!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098_Deo gratias_!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he answered half asleep, with his eyes still swollen\nwith slumber.\n\nAnd he jumped out upon his strip of carpet, washed himself, made his\nbed, swept his room, and refilled his little pitcher. He enjoyed this\npetty domestic work while the morning air sent a thrilling shiver\nthroughout his frame. He could hear the sparrows in the plane-trees\nof the court-yard, rising at the same time as himself with a deafening\nnoise of wings and notes--their way of saying their prayers, thought he.\nThen he went down to the meditation room, and stayed there on his knees\nfor half an hour after prayers, to con that reflection of St. Ignatius:\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What profit be it to a man to gain the whole world if he lose his\nsoul?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 A subject, this, fertile in good resolutions, which impelled him\nto renounce all earthly goods, and dwell on that fond dream of a desert\nlife, beneath the solitary wealth and luxury of a vast blue sky. When\nten minutes had passed, his bruised knees became so painful that his\nwhole being slowly swooned into ecstasy, in which he pictured himself as\na mighty conqueror, the master of an immense empire, flinging down his\ncrown, breaking his sceptre, trampling under foot unheard-of wealth,\nchests of gold, floods of jewels, and rich stuffs embroidered with\nprecious stones, before going to bury himself in some Thebais, clothed\nin rough drugget that rasped his back. Mass, however, snatched him from\nthese heated fancies, upon which he looked back as upon some beautiful\nreality which might have been his lot in ancient times; and then, his\ncommunion made, he chanted the psalm for the day unconscious of any\nother voice than his own, which rang out with crystal purity, flying\nupward till it reached the very ear of the Lord.\n\nWhen he returned to his room he ascended the stairs step by step, as\nadvised by St. Bonaventura and St. Thomas Aquinas. His gait was slow,\nhis mien grave; he kept his head bowed as he walked along, finding\nineffable delight in complying with the most trifling regulations. Next\ncame breakfast. It was pleasant in the refectory to see the hunks of\nbread and the glasses of white wine, set out in rows. He had a good\nappetite, and was of a joyous mood. He would say, for instance, that\nthe wine was truly Christian--a daring allusion to the water which the\nbursar was taxed with putting in the bottles. Still his gravity at once\nreturned to him on going in to lectures. He took notes on his knees,\nwhile the professor, resting his hands on the edge of his desk, talked\naway in familiar Latin, interspersed with an occasional word in French,\nwhen he was at fault for a better. A discussion would then follow in\nwhich the students argued in a strange jargon, with never a smile upon\ntheir faces. Then, at ten o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, there came twenty minutes\u00e2\u0080\u0099 reading\nof Holy Writ. He fetched the Sacred Book, a volume richly bound and\ngilt-edged. Having kissed it with especial reverence, he read it out\nbare-headed, bowing every time he came upon the name of Jesus, Mary, or\nJoseph. And with the arrival of the second meditation he was ready to\nendure for love of God another and even longer spell of kneeling\nthan the first. He avoided resting on his heels for a second even.\nHe delighted in that examination of conscience which lasted for\nthree-quarters of an hour. He racked his memory for sins, and at times\neven fancied himself damned for forgetting to kiss the pictures on his\nscapular the night before, or for having gone to sleep upon his left\nside--abominable faults which he would have willingly redeemed by\nwearing out his knees till night; and yet happy faults, in that they\nkept him busy, for without them he would have no occupation for his\nunspotted heart, steeped in a life of purity.\n\nHe would return to the refectory, as if relieved of some great crime.\nThe seminarists on duty, wearing blue linen aprons, and having their\ncassock sleeves tucked up, brought in the vermicelli soup, the boiled\nbeef cut into little squares, and the helps of roast mutton and French\nbeans. Then followed a terrific rattling of jaws, a gluttonous silence,\na desperate plying of forks, only broken by envious greedy glances at\nthe horseshoe table, where the heads of the seminary ate more delicate\nmeats and drank ruddier wines. And all the while above the hubbub some\nstrong-lunged peasant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son, with a thick voice and utter disregard for\npunctuation, would hem and haw over the perusal of some letters from\nmissionaries, some episcopal pastoral, or some article from a religious\npaper. To this he listened as he ate. Those polemical fragments, those\nnarratives of distant travels, surprised, nay, even frightened him, with\ntheir revelations of bustling, boundless fields of action, of which\nhe had never dreamt, beyond the seminary walls. Eating was still in\nprogress when the wooden clapper announced the recreation hour. The\nrecreation-ground was a sandy yard, in which stood eight plane-trees,\nwhich in summer cast cool shadows around. On the south side rose a wall,\nseventeen feet high, and bristling with broken glass, above which all\nthat one saw of Plassans was the steeple of St. Mark, rising like a\nstony needle against the blue sky. To and fro he slowly paced the court\nwith a row of fellow-students; and each time he faced the wall he eyed\nthat spire which to him represented the whole town, the whole\nearth spread beneath the scudding clouds. Noisy groups waxed hot in\ndisputation round the plane-trees; friends would pair off in the\ncorners under the spying glance of some director concealed behind his\nwindow-blind. Tennis and skittle matches would be quickly organised to\nthe great discomfort of quiet loto players who lounged on the ground\nbefore their cardboard squares, which some bowl or ball would suddenly\nsmother with sand. But when the bell sounded the noise ceased, a flight\nof sparrows rose from the plane-trees, and the breathless students\nbetook themselves to their lesson in plain-chant with folded arms and\nhanging heads. And thus Serge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s day closed in peacefulness; he returned\nto his work; then, at four o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, he partook of his afternoon snack,\nand renewed his everlasting walk in sight of St. Mark\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spire. Supper\nwas marked by the same rattling of jaws and the same droning perusal as\nthe midday meal. And when it was over Serge repaired to the chapel to\nattend prayers, and finally betook himself to bed at a quarter past\neight, after first sprinkling his pallet with holy water to ward off all\nevil dreams.\n\nHow many delightful days like these had he not spent in that ancient\nconvent of old Plassans, where abode the aroma of centuries of piety!\nFor five years had the days followed one another, flowing on with the\nunvarying murmur of limpid water. In this present hour he recalled a\nthousand little incidents which moved him. He remembered going with his\nmother to purchase his first outfit, his two cassocks, his two waist\nsashes, his half-dozen bands, his eight pairs of socks, his surplice,\nand his three-cornered hat. And how his heart had beaten that mild\nOctober evening when the seminary door had first closed behind him!\nHe had gone thither at twenty, after his school years, seized with a\nyearning to believe and love. The very next day he had forgotten all,\nas if he had fallen into a long sleep in that big silent house. He once\nmore saw the narrow cell in which he had lived through his two years as\nstudent of philosophy--a little hutch with only a bed, a table, and a\nchair, divided from the other cells by badly fitted partitions, in a\nvast hall containing about fifty similar little dens. And he again\nsaw the cell he had dwelt in three years longer while in the theology\nclass--a larger one, with an armchair, a dressing-table, and a\nbookcase--a happy room full of the dreams which his faith had evoked.\nDown those endless passages, up those stairs of stone, in all sorts of\nnooks, sudden inspirations, unexpected aid had come to him. From the\nlofty ceilings fell the voices of guardian angels. There was not a\nflagstone in the halls, not an ashlar of the walls, not a bough of the\nplane-trees, but it spoke to him of the delights of his contemplative\nlife, his lispings of tenderness, his gradual initiation, the favours\nvouchsafed him in return for self-bestowal, all that happiness of divine\nfirst love.\n\nOn such and such a day, on awaking, he had beheld a bright flood of\nlight which had steeped him in joy. On such and such an evening as he\nclosed the door of his cell he had felt warm hands clasping his neck\nso lovingly that he had lost consciousness, and had afterwards found\nhimself on the floor weeping and choked by sobs. Again, at other\ntimes, especially in the little archway leading to the chapel, he had\nsurrendered himself to supple arms which raised him from the ground. All\nheaven had then been concerned in him, had moved round him, and imparted\nto his slightest actions a peculiar sense, an astonishing perfume, which\nseemed to cling faintly to his clothes, to his very skin. And again,\nhe remembered the Thursday walks. They started at two o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock for some\nverdant nook about three miles from Plassans. Often they sought a meadow\non the banks of the Viorne, where the gnarled willows steeped their\nleaves in the stream. But he saw nothing--neither the big yellow flowers\nin the meadow, nor the swallows sipping as they flew by, with wings\nlightly touching the surface of the little river. Till six o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock,\nseated in groups beneath the willows, his comrades and himself recited\nthe Office of the Virgin in common, or read in pairs the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Little Hours,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nthe book of prayers recommended to young seminarists, but not enjoined\non them.\n\nAbbe Mouret smiled as he stirred the burning embers of his vine-stock\nfire. In all that past he only found great purity and perfect obedience.\nHe had been a lily whose sweet scent had charmed his masters. He could\nnot recall a single bad action. He had never taken advantage of the\nabsolute freedom of those walks, when the two prefects in charge would\ngo off to have a chat with a parish priest in the neighbourhood, or to\nhave a smoke behind a hedge, or to drink beer with a friend. Never had\nhe hidden a novel under his mattress, nor a bottle of _anisette_ in\na cupboard. For a long time, even, he had had no suspicion of the\nsinfulness around him--of the wings of chicken and the cakes smuggled\ninto the seminary in Lent, of the guilty letters brought in by servers,\nof the abominable conversations carried on in whispers in certain\ncorners of the courtyard. He had wept hot tears when he first perceived\nthat few among his fellows loved God for His own sake. There were\npeasants\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sons there who had taken orders simply through their terror\nof conscription, sluggards who dreamed of a career of idleness, and\nambitious youths already agitated by a vision of the staff and the\nmitre. And when he found the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wickedness reappearing at the\naltar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very foot, he had withdrawn still further into himself, giving\nhimself still more to God, to console Him for being forsaken.\n\nHe did recollect, however, that he had crossed his legs one day in\nclass, and that, when the professor reproved him for it, his face had\nbecome fiery red, as if he had committed some abominable action. He\nwas one of the best students, never arguing, but learning his texts by\nheart. He established the existence and eternity of God by proofs drawn\nfrom Holy Writ, the opinions of the fathers of the Church, the universal\nconsensus of all mankind. This kind of reasoning filled him with an\nunshakeable certainty. During his first year of philosophy, he had\nworked at his logic so earnestly that his professor had checked him,\nremarking that the most learned were not the holiest. In his second\nyear, therefore, he had carried out his study of metaphysics as a\nregulation task, constituting but a small fraction of his daily duties.\nHe felt a growing contempt for science; he wished to remain ignorant, in\norder to preserve the humility of his faith. Later on, he only followed\nthe course of Rohrbacher\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0098Ecclesiastical History\u00e2\u0080\u0099 from submission;\nhe ventured as far as Gousset\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arguments, and Bouvier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0098Theological\nCourse,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 without daring to take up Bellarmin, Liguori, Suarez, or St.\nThomas Aquinas. Holy Writ alone impassioned him. Therein he found all\ndesirable knowledge, a tale of infinite love which should be sufficient\ninstruction for all men of good-will. He simply adopted the dicta of his\nteachers, casting on them the care of inquiry, needing nought of such\nrubbish to know how to love, and accusing books of stealing away the\ntime which should be devoted to prayer. He even succeeded in forgetting\nhis years of college life. He no longer knew anything, but was\nsimplicity itself, a child brought back to the lispings of his\ncatechism.\n\nSuch was the manner in which he had ascended step by step to the\npriesthood. And here his recollections thronged more quickly on him,\nsofter, still warm with heavenly joy. Each year he had drawn nearer\nto God. His vacations had been spent in holy fashion at an uncle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, in\nconfessions every day and communions twice a week. He would lay fasts\nupon himself, hide rock-salt inside his trunk, and kneel on it with\nbared knees for hours together. At recreation time he remained in\nchapel, or went up to the room of one of the directors, who told him\npious and extraordinary stories. Then, as the fast of the Holy Trinity\ndrew nigh, he was rewarded beyond all measure, overwhelmed by\nthe stirring emotion which pervades all seminaries on the eve of\nordinations. This was the great festival of all, when the sky opened to\nallow the elect to rise another step nearer unto God. For a fortnight\nin advance he imposed a bread and water diet on himself. He closed\nhis window blinds so that he might not see the daylight at all, and\nhe prostrated himself in the gloom to implore Jesus to accept his\nsacrifice. During the last four days he suffered torturing pangs,\nterrible scruples, which would force him from his bed in the middle\nof the night to knock at the door of some strange priest giving the\nRetreat--some barefooted Carmelite, or often a converted Protestant\nrespecting whom some wonderful story was current. To him he would\nmake at great length a general confession of his whole life in a voice\nchoking with sobs. Absolution alone quieted him, refreshed him, as if he\nhad enjoyed a bath of grace.\n\nOn the morning of the great day he felt wholly white; and so vividly was\nhe conscious of his whiteness that he seemed to himself to shed light\naround him. The seminary bell rang out in clear notes, while all the\nscents of June--the perfume of blossoming stocks, of mignonette and of\nheliotropes--came over the lofty courtyard wall. In the chapel relatives\nwere waiting in their best attire, so deeply moved that the women sobbed\nbehind their veils. Next came the procession--the deacons about to\nreceive their priesthood in golden chasubles, the sub-deacons in\ndalmatics, those in minor orders and the tonsured with their surplices\nfloating on their shoulders and their black birettas in their hands. The\norgan rolled diffusing the flutelike notes of a canticle of joy. At the\naltar, the bishop officiated, staff in hand, assisted by two canons. All\nthe Chapter were there, the priests of all the parishes thronged thick\namid a dazzling wealth of apparel, a flaring of gold beneath a broad\nray of sunlight falling from a window in the nave. The epistle over, the\nordination began.\n\nAt this very hour Abbe Mouret could remember the chill of the scissors\nwhen he was marked with the tonsure at the beginning of his first year\nof theology. It had made him shudder slightly. But the tonsure had then\nbeen very small, hardly larger than a penny. Later, with each fresh\norder conferred on him, it had grown and grown until it crowned him with\na white spot as large as a big Host. The organ\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hum grew softer, and\nthe censers swung with a silvery tinkling of their slender chains,\nreleasing a cloudlet of white smoke, which unrolled in lacelike folds.\nHe could see himself, a tonsured youth in a surplice, led to the altar\nby the master of ceremonies; there he knelt and bowed his head down low,\nwhile the bishop with golden scissors snipped off three locks--one over\nhis forehead, and the other two near his ears. Yet another twelvemonth,\nand he could again see himself in the chapel amid the incense, receiving\nthe four minor orders. Led by an archdeacon, he went to the main\ndoorway, closed the door with a bang, and opened it again, to show that\nto him was entrusted the care of churches; next he rang a small bell\nwith his right hand, in token that it was his duty to call the faithful\nto the divine offices; then he returned to the altar, where fresh\nprivileges were conferred upon him by the bishop--those of singing the\nlessons, of blessing the bread, of catechising children, of exorcising\nevil spirits, of serving the deacons, of lighting and extinguishing the\ncandles of the altars.\n\nNext came back the memory of the ensuing ordination, more solemn and\nmore dread, amid the same organ strains which sounded now like God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own\nthunder: this time he wore a sub-deacon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dalmatic upon his shoulders,\nhe bound himself for ever by the vow of chastity, he trembled in every\npore, despite his faith, at the terrible _Accedite_ from the bishop,\nwhich put to flight two of his companions, blanching by his side. His\nnew duties were to serve the priest at the altar, to prepare the cruets,\nsing the epistle, wipe the chalice, and carry the cross in processions.\nAnd, at last, he passed once more, and for the last time, into the\nchapel, in the radiance of a June sun: but this time he walked at the\nvery head of the procession, with alb girdled about his waist, with\nstole crossed over his breast, and chasuble falling from his neck. All\nbut fainting from emotion, he could perceive the pallid face of the\nbishop giving him the priesthood, the fulness of the ministry, by\nthe threefold laying of his hands. And after taking the oath of\necclesiastical obedience, he felt himself uplifted from the stone flags,\nwhen the prelate in a full voice repeated the Latin words: \u00e2\u0080\u0098_Accipe\nSpiritum Sanctum.... Quorum remiseris peccata, remittuntur eis, et\nquorum retinueris, retenta sunt_.\u00e2\u0080\u0099--\u00e2\u0080\u0098Receive the Holy Ghost.... Whose\nsins thou dost forgive they are forgiven; and whose sins thou dost\nretain, they are retained.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\n\n\nXVI\n\nThis evocation of the deep joys of his youth had given Abbe Mouret a\ntouch of feverishness. He no longer felt the cold. He put down the tongs\nand walked towards the bedstead as if about to go to bed, but turned\nback and pressed his forehead to a window-pane, looking out into the\nnight with sightless eyes. Could he be ill? Why did he feel such\nlanguor in all his limbs, why did his blood burn in every vein? On two\noccasions, while at the seminary, he had experienced similar attacks--a\nsort of physical discomfort which made him most unhappy; one day,\nindeed, he had gone to bed in raving delirium. Then he bethought himself\nof a young girl possessed by evil spirits, whom Brother Archangias\nasserted he had cured with a simple sign of the cross, one day when she\nfell down before him. This reminded him of the spiritual exorcisms which\none of his teachers had formerly recommended to him: prayer, a general\nconfession, frequent communion, the choosing of a wise confessor\nwho should have great authority on his mind. And then, without any\ntransition, with a suddenness which astonished himself, he saw in\nthe depths of his memory the round face of one of his old friends, a\npeasant, who had been a choir boy at eight years old, and whose expenses\nat the seminary were defrayed by a lady who watched over him. He was\nalways laughing, he rejoiced beforehand at the anticipated emoluments of\nhis career; twelve hundred francs of stipend, a vicarage at the end of a\ngarden, presents, invitations to dinners, little profits from weddings,\nand baptismal and burial fees. That young fellow must indeed be happy in\nhis parish.\n\nThe feeling of melancholy regret evoked by this recollection surprised\nAbbe Mouret extremely. Was he not happy, too? Until that day he had\nregretted nothing, wished for nothing, envied nothing. Even as he\nsearched himself at that very moment he failed to find any cause for\nbitterness. He believed himself the same as in the early days of his\ndeaconship, when the obligatory perusal of his breviary at certain\nstated hours had filled his days with continuous prayer. No doubts had\ntormented him; he had prostrated himself before the mysteries he could\nnot understand; he had sacrificed his reason, which he despised, with\nthe greatest ease. When he left the seminary, he had rejoiced at finding\nhimself a stranger among his fellowmen, no longer walking like them,\ncarrying his head differently, possessed of the gestures, words, and\nopinions of a being apart. He had felt emasculated, nearer to the\nangels, cleansed of sexuality. It had almost made him proud to belong\nno longer to his species, to have been brought up for God and carefully\npurged of all human grossness by a jealously watchful training. Again,\nit had seemed to him as if for years he had been dwelling in holy\noil, prepared with all due rites, which had steeped his flesh in\nbeatification. His limbs, his brain, had lost material substance to\ngain in soulfulness, impregnated with a subtle vapour which, at times,\nintoxicated him and dizzied him as if the earth had suddenly failed\nbeneath his feet. He displayed the fears, the unwittingness, the open\ncandour of a cloistered maiden. He sometimes remarked with a smile that\nhe was prolonging his childhood, under the impression that he was still\nquite little, retaining the same sensations, the same ideas, the same\nopinions as in the past. At six years old, for instance, he had known as\nmuch of God as he knew at twenty-five; in prayer the inflexions of\nhis voice were still the same, and he yet took a childish pleasure in\nfolding his hands quite correctly. The world too seemed to him the same\nas he had seen in former days when his mother led him by the hand.\nHe had been born a priest, and a priest he had grown up. Whenever he\ndisplayed before La Teuse some particularly gross ignorance of life, she\nwould stare him in the face, astounded, and remark with a strange smile\nthat \u00e2\u0080\u0098he was Mademoiselle Desiree\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brother all over.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nIn all his existence he could only recall one shock of shame. It\nhad happened during his last six months at the seminary, between his\ndeaconship and priesthood. He had been ordered to read the work of Abbe\nCraisson, the superior of the great seminary at Valence: \u00e2\u0080\u0098_De rebus\nVeneris ad usum confessariorum_.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And he had risen from this book\nterrified and choking with sobs. That learned casuistry, dealing so\nfully with the abominations of mankind, descending to the most monstrous\nexamples of vice, violated, as it were, all his virginity of body\nand mind. He felt himself for ever befouled. Yet every time he heard\nconfessions he inevitably recurred to that catechism of shame. And\nthough the obscurities of dogma, the duties of his ministry, and the\ndeath of all free will within him left him calm and happy at being\nnought but the child of God, he retained, in spite of himself, a carnal\ntaint of the horrors he must needs stir up; he was conscious of an\nineffaceable stain, deep down somewhere in his being, which might some\nday grow larger and cover him with mud.\n\nThe moon was rising behind the Garrigue hills. Abbe Mouret, still more\nand more feverish, opened the window and leaned out upon his elbows,\nthat he might feel upon his face the coolness of the night. He could no\nlonger remember at what time exactly this illness had come upon him.\nHe recollected, however, that in the morning, while saying mass, he had\nbeen quite calm and restful. It must have been later, perhaps during\nhis long walk in the sun, or while he shivered under the trees of the\nParadou, or while stifling in Desiree\u00e2\u0080\u0099s poultry-yard. And then he lived\nthrough the day again.\n\nBefore him stretched the vast plain, more direful still beneath the\npallid light of the oblique moonbeams. The olive and almond trees showed\nlike grey spots amid the chaos of rocks spreading to the sombre row of\nhills on the horizon. There were big splotches of gloom, bumpy ridges,\nblood-hued earthy pools in which red stars seemed to contemplate one\nanother, patches of chalky light, suggestive of women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s garments cast\noff and disclosing shadowy forms which slumbered in the hollow folds\nof ground. At night that glowing landscape weltered there strangely,\npassionately, slumbering with uncovered bosom, and outspread twisted\nlimbs, whilst heaving mighty sighs, and exhaling the strong aroma of\na sweating sleeper. It was as if some mighty Cybele had fallen there\nbeneath the moon, intoxicated with the embraces of the sun. Far away,\nAbbe Mouret\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes followed the path to Les Olivettes, a narrow pale\nribbon stretching along like a wavy stay-lace. He could hear Brother\nArchangias whipping the truant schoolgirls, and spitting in the faces\nof their elder sisters. He could see Rosalie slyly laughing in her hands\nwhile old Bambousse hurled clods of earth after her and smote her on\nher hips. Then, too, he thought, he had still been well, his neck barely\nheated by the lovely morning sunshine. He had felt but a quivering\nbehind him, that confused hum of life, which he had faintly heard since\nmorning when the sun, in the midst of his mass, had entered the church\nby the shattered windows. Never, then, had the country disturbed him,\nas it did at this hour of night, with its giant bosom, its yielding\nshadows, its gleams of ambery skin, its lavish goddess-like nudity,\nscarce hidden by the silvery gauze of moonlight.\n\nThe young priest lowered his eyes, and gazed upon the village of Les\nArtaud. It had sunk into the heavy slumber of weariness, the soundness\nof peasants\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sleep. Not a light: the battered hovels showed like\ndusky mounds intersected by the white stripes of cross lanes which the\nmoonbeams swept. Even the dogs were surely snoring on the thresholds of\nthe closed doors. Had the Artauds poisoned the air of the parsonage with\nsome abominable plague? Behind him gathered and swept the gust whose\napproach filled him with so much anguish. Now he could detect a sound\nlike the tramping of a flock, a whiff of dusty air, which reached him\nladen with the emanations of beasts. Again came back his thoughts of a\nhandful of men beginning the centuries over again, springing up between\nthose naked rocks like thistles sown by the winds. In his childhood\nnothing had amazed and frightened him more than those myriads of insects\nwhich gushed forth when he raised certain damp stones. The Artauds\ndisturbed him even in their slumber; he could recognise their breath\nin the air he inhaled. He would have liked to have had the rocks alone\nbelow his window. The hamlet was not dead enough; the thatched roofs\nbulged like bosoms; through the gaping cracks in the doors came low\nfaint sounds which spoke of all the swarming life within. Nausea came\nupon him. Yet he had often faced it all without feeling any other need\nthan that of refreshing himself in prayer.\n\nHis brow perspiring, he proceeded to open the other window, as if to\nseek cooler air. Below him, to his left, lay the graveyard with the\nSolitaire erect like a bar, unstirred by the faintest breeze. From the\nempty field arose an odour like that of a newly mown meadow. The\ngrey wall of the church, that wall full of lizards and planted with\nwall-flowers, gleamed coldly in the moonlight, and the panes of one of\nthe windows glistened like plates of steel. The sleeping church could\nnow have no other life within it than the extra-human life of the\nDivinity embodied in the Host enclosed in the tabernacle. He thought of\nthe bracket lamp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s yellow glow peeping out of the gloom, and was tempted\nto go down once more to try to ease his ailing head amid those deep\nshadows. But a strange feeling of terror held him back; he suddenly\nfancied, while his eyes were fixed upon the moonlit panes, that he saw\nthe church illumined by a furnace-like glare, the blaze of a festival\nof hell, in which whirled the Month of May, the plants, the animals,\nand the girls of Les Artaud, who wildly encircled trees with their\nbare arms. Then, as he leaned over, he saw beneath him Desiree\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\npoultry-yard, black and steaming. He could not clearly distinguish the\nrabbit-hutches, the fowls\u00e2\u0080\u0099 roosting-places, or the ducks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 house. The\nplace was all one big mass heaped up in stench, still exhaling in its\nsleep a pestiferous odour. From under the stable-door came the acrid\nsmell of the nanny-goat; while the little pig, stretched upon his back,\nsnorted near an empty porringer. And suddenly with his brazen throat\nAlexander, the big yellow cock, raised a crow, which awoke in the\ndistance impassioned calls from all the cocks of the village.\n\nThen all at once Abbe Mouret remembered: The fever had struck him in\nDesiree\u00e2\u0080\u0099s farmyard, while he was looking at the hens still warm from\nlaying, the rabbit-does plucking the down from under them. And now the\nfeeling that some one was breathing on his neck became so distinct that\nhe turned at last to see who was behind him. And then he recalled Albine\nbounding out of the Paradou, and the door slamming upon the vision of an\nenchanted garden; he recalled the girl racing alongside the interminable\nwall, following the gig at a run, and throwing birch leaves to the\nbreeze as kisses; he recalled her, again, in the twilight, laughing at\nthe oaths of Brother Archangias, her skirts skimming over the path like\na cloudlet of dust bowled along by the evening breeze. She was sixteen;\nhow strange she looked, with her rather elongated face! she savoured\nof the open air, of the grass, of mother earth. And so accurate was his\nrecollection of her that he could once more see a scratch upon one of\nher supple wrists, a rosy scar on her white skin. Why did she laugh like\nthat when she looked at him with her blue eyes? He was engulfed in her\nlaugh as in a sonorous wave which resounded and pressed close to him on\nevery side; he inhaled it, he felt it vibrate within him. Yes, all his\nevil came from that laugh of hers which he had quaffed.\n\nStanding in the middle of the room, with both windows open, he remained\nshivering, seized with a fright which made him hide his face in his\nhands. So this was the ending of the whole day; this evocation of a fair\ngirl, with a somewhat long face and eyes of blue. And the whole day\ncame in through the open windows. In the distance--the glow of those red\nlands, the ardent passion of the big rocks, of the olive-trees springing\nup amid the stones, of the vines twisting their arms by the roadside.\nNearer--the steam of human sweat borne in upon the air from Les Artaud,\nthe musty odour of the cemetery, the fragrance of incense from the\nchurch, tainted by the scent of greasy-haired wenches. And there\nwas also the steaming muck-heap, the fumes of the poultry-yard, the\noppressing ferment of animal germs. And all these vapours poured in at\nonce, in one asphyxiating gust, so offensive, so violent, as to choke\nhim. He tried to close his senses, to subdue and annihilate them. But\nAlbine reappeared before him like a tall flower that had sprung and\ngrown beautiful in that soil. She was the natural blossom of that\ncorruption, delicate in the sunshine, her white shoulders expanding in\nyouthfulness, her whole being so fraught with the gladness of life, that\nshe leaped from her stem and darted upon his mouth, scenting him with\nher long ripple of laughter.\n\nA cry burst from the priest. He had felt a burning touch upon his lips.\nA stream as of fire coursed through his veins. And then, in search\nof refuge, he threw himself on his knees before the statuette of the\nImmaculate Conception, exclaiming, with folded hands:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Holy Virgin of Virgins, pray for me!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\n\n\nXVII\n\nThe Immaculate Conception, set on the walnut chest of drawers, was\nsmiling softly, with her slender lips, marked by a dash of carmine. Her\nform was small and wholly white. Her long white veil, falling from head\nto foot, had but an imperceptible thread of gold around its edge. Her\ngown, draped in long straight folds over a sexless figure, was fastened\naround her flexible neck. Not a single lock of her chestnut hair peeped\nforth. Her countenance was rosy, with clear eyes upturned to heaven: her\nhands were clasped--rosy, childlike hands, whose finger-tips appeared\nbeneath the folds of her veil, above the azure scarf which seemed to\ngirdle her waist with two streaming ends of the firmament. Of all her\nwomanly charms not one was bared, except her feet, adorable feet which\ntrod the mystical eglantine. And from those nude feet sprang golden\nroses, like the natural efflorescence of her twofold purity of flesh.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Virgin most faithful, pray for me,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the priest despairingly pleaded.\n\nThis Virgin had never distressed him. She was not a mother yet; she\ndid not offer Jesus to him, her figure did not yet present the rounded\noutlines of maternity. She was not the Queen of Heaven descending,\ncrowned with gold and clothed in gold like a princess of the earth,\nborne in triumph by a flight of cherubim. She had never assumed an\nawesome mien; had never spoken to him with the austere severity of an\nall-powerful mistress, the very sight of whom must bow all foreheads\nto the dust. He could dare to look on her and love her, without fear of\nbeing moved by the gentle wave of her chestnut hair; her bare feet alone\nexcited his affection, those feet of love which blossomed like a garden\nof chastity in too miraculous a manner for him to seek to cover them\nwith kisses. She scented his room with lily-like fragrance. She was\nindeed the silver lily planted in a golden vase, she was precious,\neternal, impeccable purity. Within the white veil, so closely drawn\nround her, there could be nothing human--only a virgin flame, burning\nwith ever even glow. At night when he went to bed, in the morning\nwhen he woke, he could see her there, still and ever wearing that same\necstatic smile.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Mother most pure, Mother most chaste, Mother ever-virgin, pray for me!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nhe stammered in his fear, pressing close to the Virgin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feet, as if he\ncould hear Albine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sonorous footfalls behind him. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You are my refuge,\nthe source of my joy, the seat of my wisdom, the tower of ivory in\nwhich I have shut up my purity. I place myself in your spotless hands, I\nbeseech you to take me, to cover me with a corner of your veil, to\nhide me beneath your innocence, behind the hallowed rampart of your\ngarment--so that no fleshly breath may reach me. I need you, I die\nwithout you, I shall feel for ever parted from you, if you do not bear\nme away in your helpful arms, far hence into the glowing whiteness\nwherein you dwell. O Mary, conceived without sin, annihilate me in the\ndepths of the immaculate snow that falls from your every limb. You are\nthe miracle of eternal chastity. Your race has sprung from a very beam\nof grace, like some wondrous tree unsown by any germ. Your son, Jesus,\nwas born of the breath of God; you yourself were born without defilement\nof your mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s womb, and I would believe that this virginity goes back\nthus from age to age in endless unwittingness of flesh. Oh! to live, to\ngrow up outside the pale of the senses! Oh! to perpetuate life solely by\nthe contact of a celestial kiss!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThis despairing appeal, this cry of purified longing, calmed the young\npriest\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fears. The Virgin--wholly white, with eyes turned heavenward,\nappeared to smile more tenderly with her thin red lips. And in a\nsoftened voice he went on:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I should like to be a child once more. I should like to be always a\nchild, walking in the shadow of your gown. When I was quite little, I\nclasped my hands when I uttered the name of Mary. My cradle was\nwhite, my body was white, my every thought was white. I could see you\ndistinctly, I could hear you calling me, I went towards you in the light\nof a smile over scattered rose-petals. And nought else did I feel or\nthink, I lived but just enough to be a flower at your feet. No one\nshould grow up. You would have around you none but fair young heads, a\ncrowd of children who would love you with pure hands, unsullied lips,\ntender limbs, stainless as if fresh from a bath of milk. To kiss a\nchild\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cheek is to kiss its soul. A child alone can say your name\nwithout befouling it. In later years our lips grow tainted and reek of\nour passions. Even I, who love you so much, and have given myself to\nyou, I dare not at all times call on you, for I would not let you\ncome in contact with the impurities of my manhood. I have prayed and\nchastised my flesh, I have slept in your keeping, and lived in chastity;\nand yet I weep to see that I am not yet dead enough to this world to\nbe your betrothed. O Mary! adorable Virgin, why can I not be only five\nyears old--why could I not remain the child who pressed his lips to your\npictures? I would take you to my heart, I would lay you by my side, I\nwould clasp and kiss you like a friend--like a girl of my own age. Your\nclose hanging garments, your childish veil, your blue scarf--all that\nyouthfulness which makes you like an elder sister would be mine. I would\nnot try to kiss your locks, for hair is a naked thing which should\nnot be seen; but I would kiss your bare feet, one after the other, for\nnights and nights together, until my lips should have shred the petals\nof those golden roses, those mystical roses of our veins.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe stopped, waiting for the Virgin to look down upon him and touch\nhis forehead with the edges of her veil. But she remained enwrapped\nin muslin to her neck and finger-nails and ankles, so slim, so\netherealised, that she already seemed to be above earth, to be wholly\nheaven\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, then,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he went on more wildly still, \u00e2\u0080\u0098grant that I become a child\nagain, O kindly Virgin! Virgin most powerful. Grant that I may be only\nfive years old. Rid me of my senses, rid me of my manhood. Let a miracle\nsweep away all the man that has grown up within me. You reign in heaven,\nnothing is easier to you than to change me, to rid me of all my strength\nso that evermore I may be unable to raise my little finger without your\nleave. I wish never more to feel either nerve, or muscle, or the beating\nof my heart. I long to be simply a thing--a white stone at your feet,\non which you will leave but a perfume; a stone that will not move from\nwhere you cast it, but will remain earless and eyeless, content to lie\nbeneath your heel, unable to think of foulness! Oh! then what bliss\nfor me! I shall reach without an effort and at a bound my dream of\nperfection. I shall at last proclaim myself your true priest. I shall\nbecome what all my studies, my prayers, my five years of initiation\nhave been unable to make me. Yes, I reject life; I say that the death of\nmankind is better than abomination. Everything is stained; everywhere is\nlove tainted. Earth is steeped in impurity, whose slightest drops yield\ngrowths of shame. But that I may be perfect, O Queen of angels, hearken\nto my prayer, and grant it! Make me one of those angels that have only\ntwo great wings behind their cheeks; I shall then no longer have a body,\nno longer have any limbs; I will fly to you if you call me. I shall be\nbut a mouth to sing your praises, a pair of spotless wings to cradle\nyou in your journeys through the heavens. O death! death! Virgin, most\nvenerable, grant me the death of all! I will love you for the death of\nmy body, the death of all that lives and multiplies. I will consummate\nwith you the sole marriage that my heart desires. I will ascend, ever\nhigher and higher, till I have reached the brasier in which you shine\nin splendour. There one beholds a mighty planet, an immense white rose,\nwhose every petal glows like a moon, a silver throne whence you beam\nwith such a blaze of innocence that heaven itself is all illumined by\nthe gleam of your veil alone. All that is white, the early dawns, the\nsnow on inaccessible peaks, the lilies barely opening, the water of\nhidden, unknown springs, the milky sap of the plants untouched by\nthe sun, the smiles of maidens, the souls of children dead in their\ncradles--all rains upon your white feet. And I will rise to your mouth\nlike a subtle flame; I will enter into you by your parted lips, and\nthe bridal will be fulfilled, while the archangels are thrilled by our\njoyfulness. Oh, to be maiden, to love in maidenhood, to preserve\namid the sweetest kisses one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s maiden whiteness! To possess all love,\nstretched on the wings of swans, in a sky of purity, in the arms of\na mistress of light, whose caresses are but raptures of the soul! Oh,\nthere lies the perfection, the super-human dream, the yearning which\nshatters my very bones, the joy which bears me up to heaven! O Mary,\nVessel of Election, rid me of all that is human in me, so that you may\nfearlessly surrender to me the treasure of your maidenhood!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAnd then Abbe Mouret, felled by fever, his teeth chattering, swooned\naway on the floor.\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK II\n\n\n\n\nI\n\nThrough calico curtains, carefully drawn across the two large windows,\na pale white light like that of breaking day filtered into the room. It\nwas a lofty and spacious room, fitted up with old Louis XV. furniture,\nthe woodwork painted white, the upholstery showing a pattern of red\nflowers on a leafy ground. On the piers above the doors on either side\nof the alcove were faded paintings still displaying the rosy flesh\nof flying Cupids, whose games it was now impossible to follow. The\nwainscoting with oval panels, the folding doors, the rounded ceiling\n(once sky-blue and framed with scrolls, medallions, and bows of\nflesh-coloured ribbons), had all faded to the softest grey. Opposite the\nwindows the large alcove opened beneath banks of clouds which plaster\nCupids drew aside, leaning over, and peeping saucily towards the bed.\nAnd like the windows, the alcove was curtained with coarsely hemmed\ncalico, whose simplicity seemed strange in this room where lingered a\nperfume of whilom luxury and voluptuousness.\n\nSeated near a pier table, on which a little kettle bubbled over a\nspirit-lamp, Albine intently watched the alcove curtains. She was\ngowned in white, her hair gathered up in an old lace kerchief, her hands\ndrooping wearily, as she kept watch with the serious mien of youthful\nwomanhood. A faint breathing, like that of a slumbering child, could be\nheard in the deep silence. But she grew restless after a few minutes,\nand could not restrain herself from stepping lightly towards the alcove\nand raising one of the curtains. On the edge of the big bed lay Serge,\napparently asleep, with his head resting on his bent arm. During his\nillness his hair had lengthened, and his beard had grown. He looked very\nwhite, with sunken eyes and pallid lips.\n\nMoved by the sight Albine was about to let the curtain fall again. But\nSerge faintly murmured, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I am not asleep.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe lay perfectly still with his head on his arm, without stirring even\na finger, as if overwhelmed by delightful weariness. His eyes had slowly\nopened, and his breath blew lightly on one of his hands, raising the\ngolden down on his fair skin.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I heard you,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he murmured again. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You were walking very gently.\u00e2\u0080\u0099*\n\n  * From this point in the original Serge and Albine thee and thou\n    one another; but although this _tutoiement_ has some bearing on\n    the development of the story, it was impossible to preserve it\n    in an English translation.--ED.\n\nHis voice enchanted her. She went up to his bed and crouched beside it\nto bring her face on a level with his own. \u00e2\u0080\u0098How are you?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she asked, and\nthen continued: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh! you are well now. Do you know, I used to cry the\nwhole way home when I came back from over yonder with bad news of you.\nThey told me you were delirious, and that if your dreadful fever did\nspare your life, it would destroy your reason. Oh, didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t I kiss your\nuncle Pascal when he brought you here to recruit your health!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen she tucked in his bed-clothes like a young mother.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Those burnt-up rocks over yonder, you see, were no good to you. You\nneed trees, and coolness, and quiet. The doctor hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even told a soul\nthat he was hiding you away here. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a secret between himself and\nthose who love you. He thought you were lost. Nobody will ever disturb\nyou, you may be sure of that! Uncle Jeanbernat is smoking his pipe by\nhis lettuce bed. The others will get news of you on the sly. Even the\ndoctor isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t coming back any more. I am to be your doctor now. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nwant any more physic, it seems. What you now want is to be loved; do you\nsee?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe did not seem to hear her, his brain as yet was void. His eyes,\nalthough his head remained motionless, wandered inquiringly round the\nroom, and it struck her that he was wondering where he might be.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098This is my room,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I have given it to you. Isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it a pretty\none? I took the finest pieces of furniture out of the lumber attic, and\nthen I made those calico curtains to prevent the daylight from dazzling\nme. And you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not putting me out a bit. I shall sleep on the second\nfloor. There are three or four empty rooms there.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nStill he looked anxious.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re alone?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes; why do you ask that?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe made no answer, but muttered wearily: \u00e2\u0080\u0098I have been dreaming, I am\nalways dreaming. I hear bells ringing, and they tire me.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAnd after a pause he went on: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Go and shut the door, bolt it; I want you\nto be alone, quite alone.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nWhen she came back, bringing a chair with her, and sat down by his\npillow, he looked as gleeful as a child, and kept on saying: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Nobody can\ncome in now. I shall not hear those bells any more. When you are talking\nto me, it rests me.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Would you like something to drink?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she asked.\n\nHe made a sign that he was not thirsty. He looked at Albine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hands as\nif so astonished, so delighted to see them, that with a smile she laid\none on the edge of his pillow. Then he let his head glide down, and\nrested his cheek against that small, cool hand, saying, with a light\nlaugh: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as soft as silk. It is just as if it were sending a\ncool breeze through my hair. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take it away, please.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen came another long spell of silence. They gazed on one another with\nloving kindliness--Albine calmly scanning herself in the convalescent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\neyes, Serge apparently listening to some faint whisper from the small,\ncool hand.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Your hand is so nice,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said once more. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fancy what good it\ndoes me. It seems to steal inside me, and take away all the pain in my\nlimbs. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as if I were being soothed all over, relieved, cured.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe gently rubbed his cheek against it, with growing animation, as if he\nwere at last coming back to life.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give me anything nasty to drink, will you? You won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry me\nwith all sorts of physic? Your hand is quite enough for me. I have come\nhere for you to put it there under my head.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Dear Serge,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Albine softly, \u00e2\u0080\u0098how you must have suffered.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Suffered! yes, yes; but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a long time ago. I slept badly, I had such\nfrightful dreams. If I could, I would tell you all about it.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe closed his eyes for a moment and strove hard to remember.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I can see nothing but darkness,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he stammered. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It is very odd, I\nhave just come back from a long journey. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even know now where I\nstarted from. I had fever, I know, a fever that raced through my veins\nlike a wild beast. That was it--now I remember. The whole time I had a\nnightmare, in which I seemed to be crawling along an endless underground\npassage; and every now and then I had an attack of intolerable pain, and\nthen the passage would be suddenly walled up. A shower of stones fell\nfrom overhead, the side walls closed in, and there I stuck, panting,\nmad to get on; and then I bored into the obstacle and battered away with\nfeet and fists, and skull, despairing of ever being able to get through\nthe ever increasing mound of rubbish. At other times, I only had to\ntouch it with my finger and it vanished: I could then walk freely along\nthe widened gallery, weary only from the pangs of my attack.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAlbine tried to lay a hand upon his lips.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said he, \u00e2\u0080\u0098it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tire me to talk. I can whisper to you\nhere, you see. I feel as if I were thinking and you could hear me. The\nqueerest point about that underground journey of mine was that I hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nthe faintest idea of turning back again; I got obstinate, although I had\nthe thought before me that it would take me thousands of years to clear\naway a single heap of wreckage. It seemed a fated task, which I had to\nfulfil under pain of the greatest misfortunes. So, with my knees all\nbruised, and my forehead bumping against the hard rock, I set myself\nto work with all my might, so that I might get to the end as quickly as\npossible. The end? What was it?... Ah! I do not know, I do not know.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe closed his eyes and pondered dreamily. Then, with a careless pout, he\nagain sank upon Albine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand and said laughing: \u00e2\u0080\u0098How silly of me! I am\na child.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut the girl, to ascertain if he were wholly hers, questioned him and\nled him back to the confused recollections he had tried to summon up.\nHe could remember nothing, however; he was truly in a happy state of\nchildhood. He fancied that he had been born the day before.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh! I am not strong enough yet,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said. \u00e2\u0080\u0098My furthest recollection is\nof a bed which burned me all over, my head rolled about on a pillow\nlike a pan of live coals, and my feet wore away with perpetual rubbing\nagainst each other. I was very bad, I know. It seemed as if I were\nhaving my body changed, as if I were being taken all to pieces, and put\ntogether again like some broken machine.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe laughed at this simile, and continued: \u00e2\u0080\u0098I shall be all new again. My\nillness has given me a fine cleaning. But what was it you were asking\nme? No, nobody was there. I was suffering all by myself at the bottom\nof a black hole. Nobody, nobody. And beyond that, nothing--I can see\nnothing.... Let me be your child, will you? You shall teach me to walk.\nI can see nothing else but you now. I care for nothing but you.... I\ncan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remember, I tell you. I came, you took me, and that is all.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAnd restfully, pettingly, he said once more: \u00e2\u0080\u0098How warm your hand is now!\nit is as nice as the sun. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let us talk any more. It makes me hot.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nA quivering silence fell from the blue ceiling of the large room. The\nspirit lamp had just gone out, and from the kettle came a finer and\nfiner thread of steam. Albine and Serge, their heads side by side upon\nthe pillow, gazed at the large calico curtains drawn across the windows.\nSerge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes, especially, were attracted to them as to the very source\nof light, in which he sought to steep himself, as in diluted sunshine\nfitted to his weakness. He could tell that the sun lay behind that\nyellower gleam upon one corner of the curtain, and that sufficed to make\nhim feel himself again. Meanwhile a far-off rustle of leaves came upon\nhis listening ear, and against the right-hand window the clean-cut\ngreenish shadow of a lofty bough brought him disturbing thoughts of the\nforest which he could feel to be near him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Would you like me to open the curtains?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 asked Albine, misunderstanding\nhis steady gaze.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No, no,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he hastily replied.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fine day; you would see the sunlight and the trees.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No, please don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.... I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to see anything outside. That bough\nthere tires me with its waving and its rising, as if it was alive. Leave\nyour hand here, I will go to sleep. All is white now. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so nice.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAnd then he calmly fell asleep, while Albine watched beside him and\nbreathed upon his face to make his slumber cool.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nThe fine weather broke up on the morrow, and it rained heavily.\nSerge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fever returned, and he spent a day of suffering, with his eyes\ndespairingly fixed upon the curtains through which the light now fell\ndim and ashy grey as in a cellar. He could no longer see a trace of\nsunshine, and he looked in vain for the shadow that had scared him, the\nshadow of that lofty bough which had disappeared amid the mist and the\npouring rain, and seemed to have carried away with it the whole forest.\nTowards evening he became slightly delirious and cried out to Albine\nthat the sun was dead, that he could hear all the sky, all the country\nbewailing the death of the sun. She had to soothe him like a child,\npromising him the sun, telling him that it would come back again, that\nshe would give it to him. But he also grieved for the plants. The seeds,\nhe said, must be suffering underground, waiting for the return of light;\nthey had nightmares, they also dreamed that they were crawling along an\nunderground passage, hindered by mounds of ruins, struggling madly to\nreach the sunshine. And he began to weep and sob out in low tones that\nwinter was a disease of the earth, and that he should die with the\nearth, unless the springtide healed them both.\n\nFor three days more the weather was truly frightful. The downpour burst\nover the trees with the awful clamour of an overflowing river. Gusts\nof wind rolled by and beat against the windows with the violence of\nenormous waves. Serge had insisted on Albine closing the shutters. By\nlamplight he was no longer troubled by the gloom of the pallid curtains,\nhe no longer felt the greyness of the sky glide in through the smallest\nchinks, and flow up to him like a cloud of dust intent on burying him.\nHowever, increasing apathy crept upon him as he lay there with shrunken\narms and pallid features; his weakness augmented as the earth grew more\nailing. At times, when the clouds were inky black, when the bending\ntrees cracked, and the grass lay limp beneath the downpour like the\nhair of a drowned woman, he all but ceased to breathe, and seemed to\nbe passing away, shattered by the hurricane. But at the first gleam of\nlight, at the tiniest speck of blue between two clouds, he breathed once\nmore and drank in the soothing calm of the drying leaves, the whitening\npaths, the fields quaffing their last draught of water. Albine now also\nlonged for the sun; twenty times a day would she go to the window on the\nlanding to scan the sky, delighted at the smallest scrap of white that\nshe espied, but perturbed when she perceived any dusky, copper-tinted,\nhail-laden masses, and ever dreading lest some sable cloud should kill\nher dear patient. She talked of sending for Doctor Pascal, but Serge\nwould not have it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098To-morrow there will be sunlight on the curtains,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098and then I\nshall be well again.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nOne evening when his condition was most alarming, Albine again gave him\nher hand to rest his cheek upon. But when she saw that it brought him no\nrelief she wept to find herself powerless. Since he had fallen into the\nlethargy of winter she had felt too weak to drag him unaided from the\nnightmare in which he was struggling. She needed the assistance of\nspring. She herself was fading away, her arms grew cold, her breath\nscant; she no longer knew how to breathe life into him. For hours\ntogether she would roam about the spacious dismal room, and as she\npassed before the mirror and saw herself darkening in it, she thought\nshe had become hideous.\n\nOne morning, however, as she raised his pillows, not daring to try again\nthe broken spell of her hands, she fancied that she once more caught the\nfirst day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s smile on Serge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lips.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Open the shutters,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said faintly.\n\nShe thought him still delirious, for only an hour previously she had\nseen but a gloomy sky on looking out from the landing.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Hush, go to sleep,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she answered sadly; \u00e2\u0080\u0098I have promised to wake you at\nthe very first ray---- Sleep on, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no sun out yet.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes, I can feel it, its light is there.... Open the shutters.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nAnd there, indeed, the sunlight was. When Albine had opened the\nshutters, behind the large curtains, the genial yellow glow once more\nwarmed a patch of the white calico. But that which impelled Serge to sit\nup in bed was the sight of the shadowy bough, the branch that for him\nheralded the return of life. All the resuscitated earth, with its wealth\nof greenery, its waters, and its belts of hills, was in that greenish\nblur that quivered with the faintest breath of air. It no longer\ndisturbed him; he greedily watched it rocking, and hungered for the\nfortified powers of the vivifying sap which to him it symbolised.\nAlbine, happy once more, exclaimed, as she supported him in her arms:\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! my dear Serge, the winter is over. Now we are saved.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe lay down again, his eyes already brighter, and his voice clearer.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098To-morrow I shall be very strong,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You shall draw back the\ncurtains. I want to see everything.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut on the morrow he was seized with childish fear. He would not hear of\nthe windows being opened wide. \u00e2\u0080\u0098By-and-by,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he muttered, \u00e2\u0080\u0098later on.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 He\nwas fearful, he dreaded the first beam of light that would flash upon\nhis eyes. Evening came on, and still he had been unable to make up\nhis mind to look upon the sun. He remained thus all day long, his face\nturned towards the curtains, watching on their transparent tissue the\npallor of morn, the glow of noon, the violet tint of twilight, all\nthe hues, all the emotions of the sky. There were pictured even the\nquiverings of the warm air at the light stroke of a bird\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wing, even\nthe delight of earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s odours throbbing in a sunbeam. Behind that veil,\nbehind that softened phantasm of the mighty life without, he could hear\nthe rise of spring. He even felt stifled at times when in spite of the\ncurtains\u00e2\u0080\u0099 barrier the rush of the earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new blood came upon him too\nstrongly.\n\nThe following morning he was still asleep when Albine, to hasten his\nrecovery, cried out to him:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Serge! Serge! here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the sun!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe swiftly drew back the curtains and threw the windows wide open. He\nraised himself and knelt upon his bed, oppressed, swooning, his hands\ntightly pressed against his breast to keep his heart from breaking.\nBefore him stretched the broad sky, all blue, a boundless blue; and\nin it he washed away his sufferings, surrendering himself to it, and\ndrinking from it sweetness and purity and youth. The bough whose shadow\nhe had noted jutted across the window and alone set against the azure\nsea its vigorous growth of green; but even this was too much for his\nsickly fastidiousness; it seemed to him that the very swallows flying\npast besmeared the purity of the azure. He was being born anew. He\nraised little involuntary cries, as he felt himself flooded with light,\nassailed by waves of warm air, while a whirling, whelming torrent of\nlife flowed within him. As last with outstretched hands he sank back\nupon his pillow in a swoon of joy.\n\nWhat a happy, delicious day that was! The sun came in from the right,\nfar away from the alcove. Throughout the morning Serge watched it\ncreeping onward. He could see it coming towards him, yellow as gold,\nperching here and there on the old furniture, frolicking in corners,\nat times gliding along the ground like a strip of ribbon. It was a slow\ndeliberate march, the approach of a fond mistress stretching her golden\nlimbs, drawing nigh to the alcove with rhythmic motion, with voluptuous\nlingering, which roused intense desire. At length, towards two o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock,\nthe sheet of sunlight left the last armchair, climbed along the\ncoverlet, and spread over the bed like loosened locks of hair. To its\nglowing fondling Serge surrendered his wasted hands: with his eyes\nhalf-closed, he could feel fiery kisses thrilling each of his fingers;\nhe lay in a bath of light, in the embrace of a glowing orb. And when\nAlbine leaned over smiling, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Let me be,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he stammered, his eyes now\nshut; \u00e2\u0080\u0098don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hold me so tightly. How do you manage to hold me like this\nin your arms?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut the sun crept down the bed again and slowly retreated to the left;\nand as Serge watched it bend once more and settle on chair after chair,\nhe bitterly regretted that he had not kept it to his breast. Albine\nstill sat upon the side of the bed, and the pair of them, an arm round\neach other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s neck, watched the slow paling of the sky. At times a mighty\nthrill seemed to make it blanch. Serge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s languid eyes now wandered over\nit more freely and detected in it exquisite tints of which he had never\ndreamed. It was not all blue, but rosy blue, lilac blue, tawny blue,\nliving flesh, vast and spotless nudity heaving like a woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bosom\nin the breeze. At every glance into space he found a fresh\nsurprise--unknown nooks, coy smiles, bewitching rounded outlines, gauzy\nveils which were cast over the mighty, glorious forms of goddesses\nin the depths of peeping paradises. And with his limbs lightened by\nsuffering he winged his way amid that shimmering silk, that stainless\ndown of azure. The sun sank lower and lower, the blue melted into purest\ngold, the sky\u00e2\u0080\u0099s living flesh gleamed fairer still, and then was slowly\nsteeped in all the hues of gloom. Not a cloud--nought but gradual\ndisappearance, a disrobing which left behind it but a gleam of modesty\non the horizon. And at last the broad sky slumbered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh, the dear baby!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed Albine, as she looked at Serge, who had\nfallen asleep upon her neck at the same time as the heavens.\n\nShe laid him down in bed and shut the windows. Next morning, however,\nthey were opened at break of day. Serge could no longer live without the\nsunlight. His strength was growing, he was becoming accustomed to the\ngusts of air which sent the alcove curtains flying. Even the azure, the\neverlasting azure, began to pall upon him. He grew weary of being white\nand swanlike, of ever swimming on heaven\u00e2\u0080\u0099s limpid lake. He came to wish\nfor a pack of black clouds, some crumbling of the skies, that would\nbreak upon the monotony of all that purity. And as his health returned,\nhe hungered for keener sensations. He now spent hours in gazing at the\nverdant bough: he would have liked to see it grow, expand, and throw\nout its branches to his very bed. It no longer satisfied him, but\nonly roused desires, speaking to him as it did of all the trees whose\ndeep-sounding call he could hear although their crests were hidden from\nhis sight. An endless whispering of leaves, a chattering as of running\nwater, a fluttering as of wings, all blended in one mighty, long-drawn,\nquivering voice, resounded in his ears.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098When you are able to get up,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Albine, \u00e2\u0080\u0098you shall sit at the\nwindow. You will see the lovely garden!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe closed his eyes and murmured gently:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh! I can see it, I hear it; I know where the trees are, where the\nwater runs, where the violets grow.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAnd then he added: \u00e2\u0080\u0098But I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see it clearly, I see it without any\nlight. I must be very strong before I shall be able to get as far as the\nwindow.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAt times when Albine thought him asleep, she would vanish for hours. And\non coming in again, she would find him burning with impatience, his eyes\ngleaming with curiosity.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Where have you been?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he would call to her, taking hold of her arms,\nand feeling her skirts, her bodice, and her cheeks. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You smell of all\nsorts of nice things. Ah! you have been walking on the grass?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAt this she would laugh and show him her shoes wet with dew.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You have been in the garden! you have been in the garden!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he then\nexclaimed delightedly. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I knew it. When you came in you seemed like a\nlarge flower. You have brought the whole garden in your skirt.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe would keep her by him, inhaling her like a nosegay. Sometimes she\ncame back with briars, leaves, or bits of wood entangled in her clothes.\nThese he would remove and hide under his pillow like relics. One day she\nbrought him a bunch of roses. At the sight of them he was so affected\nthat he wept. He kissed them and went to sleep with them in his arms.\nBut when they faded, he felt so keenly grieved that he forbade Albine to\ngather any more. He preferred her, said he, for she was as fresh and as\nbalmy; and she never faded, her hands, her hair, her cheeks were always\nfragrant. At last he himself would send her into the garden, telling her\nnot to come back before an hour.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098In that way,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I shall get sunlight, fresh air, and roses till\nto-morrow.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nOften, when he saw her coming in out of breath, he would cross-examine\nher. Which path had she taken? Had she wandered among the trees, or had\nshe gone round the meadow side? Had she seen any nests? Had she sat down\nbehind a bush of sweetbriar, or under an oak, or in the shade of a clump\nof poplars? But when she answered him and tried to describe the garden\nto him, he would put his hand to her lips.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No, no,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said gently. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It is wrong of me. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to know. I\nwould rather see it myself.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen he would relapse into his favourite dream of all the greenery which\nhe could feel only a step away. For several days he lived on that\ndream alone. At first, he said, he had perceived the garden much more\ndistinctly. As he gained strength, the surging blood that warmed\nhis veins seemed to blur his dreamy imaginings. His uncertainties\nmultiplied. He could no longer tell whether the trees were on the right,\nwhether the water flowed at the bottom of the garden, or whether some\ngreat rocks were not piled below his windows. He talked softly of all\nthis to himself. On the slightest indication he would rear wondrous\nplans, which the song of a bird, the creaking of a bough, the scent of a\nflower, would suddenly make him modify, impelling him to plant a thicket\nof lilac in one spot, and in another to place flower-beds where formerly\nthere had been a lawn. Every hour he designed some new garden, much to\nthe amusement of Albine, who, whenever she surprised him at it, would\nexclaim with a burst of laughter: \u00e2\u0080\u0098That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not it, I assure you. You\ncan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any idea of it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more beautiful than all the beautiful\nthings you ever saw. So don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go racking your head about it. The\ngarden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mine, and I will give it to you. Be easy, it won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t run away.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nSerge, who had already been so afraid of the light, felt considerable\ntrepidation when he found himself strong enough to go and rest his\nelbows on the window-sill. Every evening he once more repeated,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098To-morrow,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and \u00e2\u0080\u0098To-morrow.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 He would turn away in his bed with\na shudder when Albine came in, and would cry out that she smelt of\nhawthorn, that she had scratched her hands in burrowing a hole through\na hedge to bring him all its odour. One morning, however, she suddenly\ntook him up in her arms, and almost carrying him to the window, held him\nthere and forced him to look out and see.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What a coward you are!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she exclaimed with her fine ringing laugh.\n\nAnd waving one hand all round the landscape, she repeated with an air of\ntriumph, full of tender promise: \u00e2\u0080\u0098The Paradou! The Paradou!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nSerge looked out upon it, speechless.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nA sea of verdure, in front, to right, to left, everywhere. A sea rolling\nits surging billows of leaves as far as the horizon, unhindered by\nhouse, or screen of wall, or dusty road. A desert, virgin, hallowed\nsea, displaying its wild sweetness in the innocence of solitude. The\nsun alone came thither, weltering in the meadows in a sheet of gold,\nthreading the paths with the frolicsome scamper of its beams, letting\nits fine-spun, flaming locks droop through the trees, sipping from the\nsprings with amber lips that thrilled the water. Beneath that flaming\ndust the vast garden ran riot like some delighted beast let loose at\nthe world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very end, far from everything and free from everything.\nSo prodigal was the luxuriance of foliage, so overflowing the tide of\nherbage, that from end to end it all seemed hidden, flooded, submerged.\nNought could be seen but slopes of green, stems springing up like\nfountains, billowy masses, woodland curtains closely drawn, mantles of\ncreepers trailing over the ground, and flights of giant boughs swooping\ndown upon every side.\n\nAmidst that tremendous luxuriance of vegetation even lengthy scrutiny\ncould barely make out the bygone plan of the Paradou. In the foreground,\nin a sort of immense amphitheatre, must have lain the flower garden,\nwhose fountains were now sunken and dry, its stone balustrades\nshattered, its flight of steps all warped, and its statues overthrown,\npatches of their whiteness gleaming amidst the dusky stretches of turf.\nFarther back, behind the blue line of a sheet of water, stretched a maze\nof fruit-trees; farther still rose towering woodland, its dusky, violet\ndepths streaked with bands of light. It was a forest which had regained\nvirginity, an endless stretch of tree-tops rising one above the other,\ntinged with yellowish green and pale green and vivid green, according to\nthe variety of the species.\n\nOn the right, the forest scaled some hills, dotting them with little\nclumps of pine-trees, and dying away in straggling brushwood, while a\nhuge barrier of barren rock, heaped together like the fallen wreckage of\na mountain, shut out all view beyond. Flaming growths there cleaved the\nrugged soil, monstrous plants lay motionless in the heat, like drowsing\nreptiles; a silvery streak, a foamy splash that glistened in the\ndistance like a cloud of pearls, revealed the presence of a waterfall,\nthe source of those tranquil streams that lazily skirted the\nflower-garden. Lastly, on the left the river flowed through a vast\nstretch of meadowland, where it parted into four streamlets which winded\nfitfully beneath the rushes, between the willows, behind the taller\ntrees. And far away into the distance grassy patches prolonged the\nlowland freshness, forming a landscape steeped in bluish haze, where\na gleam of daylight slowly melted into the verdant blue of sunset. The\nParadou--its flower-garden, forest, rocks, streams, and meadows--filled\nthe whole breadth of sky.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The Paradou!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 stammered Serge, stretching out his arms as if to clasp\nthe entire garden to his breast.\n\nHe tottered, and Albine had to seat him in an armchair. There he sat\nfor two whole hours intently gazing, without opening his lips, his chin\nresting on his hands. At times his eyelids fluttered and a flush rose\nto his cheeks. Slowly he looked, profoundly amazed. It was all too vast,\ntoo complex, too overpowering.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I cannot see, I cannot understand,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he cried, stretching out his hands\nto Albine with a gesture of uttermost weariness.\n\nThe girl came and leant over the back of his armchair. Taking his head\nbetween her hands, she compelled him to look again, and softly said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all our own. Nobody will ever come in. When you are well again, we\nwill go for walks there. We shall have room enough for walking all our\nlives. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go wherever you like. Where would you like to go?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe smiled.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh! not far,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he murmured. \u00e2\u0080\u0098The first day only two steps or so beyond\nthe door. I should surely fall---- See, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go over there, under that\ntree close to the window.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut she resumed: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Would you like to go into the flower-garden, the\nparterre? You shall see the roses--they have over-run everything, even\nthe old paths are all covered with them. Or would you like the orchard\nbetter? I can only crawl into it on my hands and knees, the boughs are\nso bowed down with fruit. But we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go even farther if you feel strong\nenough. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go as far as the forest, right into the depths of shade,\nfar, far away; so far that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll sleep out there when night steals over\nus. Or else, some morning, we can climb up yonder to the summit of\nthose rocks. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see the plants which make me quake; you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see the\nsprings, such a shower of water! What fun it will be to feel the spray\nall over our faces!... But if you prefer to walk along the hedges,\nbeside a brook, we must go round by the meadows. It is so nice under\nthe willows in the evening, at sunset. One can lie down on the grass and\nwatch the little green frogs hopping about on the rushes.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No, no,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Serge, \u00e2\u0080\u0098you weary me, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to go so far.... I\nwill only go a couple of steps, that will be more than enough.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Even I,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she still continued, \u00e2\u0080\u0098even I have not yet been able to go\neverywhere. There are many nooks I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know. I have walked and walked\nin it for years, and still I feel sure there are unknown spots around,\nplaces where the shade must be cooler and the turf softer. Listen, I\nhave always fancied there must be one especially in which I should like\nto live for ever. I know it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s somewhere; I must have passed it by, or\nperhaps it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hidden so far away that I have never even got as far, with\nall my rambles. But we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll look for it together, Serge, won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t we? and\nlive there.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No, no, be quiet,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 stammered the young man. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand what\nyou are saying. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re killing me.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nFor a moment she let him sob in her arms. It troubled and grieved her\nthat she could find no words to soothe him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the Paradou as beautiful, then, as you fancied it?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she asked at\nlast.\n\nHe raised his face and answered:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know. It was quite little, and now it is ever growing bigger\nand bigger---- Take me away, hide me.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe led him back to bed, soothing him like a child, lulling him with a\nfib.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There, there! it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not true, there is no garden. It was only a story\nthat I told you. Go, sleep in peace.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nEvery day in this wise she made him sit at the window during the cool\nhours of morning. He would now attempt to take a few steps, leaning the\nwhile on the furniture. A rosy tint appeared upon his cheeks, and his\nhands began to lose their waxy transparency. But, while he thus regained\nhealth, his senses remained in a state of stupor which reduced him to\nthe vegetative life of some poor creature born only the day before.\nIndeed, he was nothing but a plant; his sole perception was that of\nthe air which floated round him. He lacked the blood necessary for\nthe efforts of life, and remained, as it were, clinging to the soil,\nimbibing all the sap he could. It was like a slow hatching in the warm\negg of springtide. Albine, remembering certain remarks of Doctor\nPascal, felt terrified at seeing him remain in this state, \u00e2\u0080\u0098innocent,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\ndull-witted like a little boy. She had heard it said that certain\nmaladies left insanity behind them. And she spent hours in gazing at him\nand trying her utmost, as mothers do, to make him smile. But as yet he\nhad not laughed. When she passed her hand across his eyes, he never\nsaw, he never followed the shadow. Even when she spoke to him, he barely\nturned his head in the direction whence the sound came. She had but one\nconsolation: he thrived splendidly, he was quite a handsome child.\n\nFor another whole week she lavished the tenderest care on him. She\npatiently waited for him to grow. And as she marked various symptoms\nof awakening perception, her fears subsided and she began to think\nthat time might make a man of him. When she touched him now he started\nslightly. Another time, one night, he broke into a feeble laugh. On the\nmorrow, when she had seated him at the window, she went down into the\ngarden, and ran about in it, calling to him the while. She vanished\nunder the trees, flitted across the sunny patches, and came back\nbreathless and clapping her hands. At first his wavering eyes failed\nto perceive her. But as she started off again, perpetually playing at\nhide-and-seek, reappearing behind every other bush, he was at last\nable to follow the white gleam of her skirt; and when she suddenly came\nforward and stood with upraised face below his window, he stretched out\nhis arms and seemed anxious to go down to her. But she came upstairs\nagain, and embraced him proudly: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! you saw me, you saw me!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she\ncried. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You would like to come into the garden with me, would you\nnot?---- If you only knew how wretched you have made me these last few\ndays, with your stupid ways, never seeing me or hearing me!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe listened to her, but apparently with some slight sensation of pain\nthat made him bend his neck in a shrinking way.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You are better now, however,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she went on. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Well enough to come down\nwhenever you like---- Why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you say anything? Have you lost your\ntongue? Oh, what a baby! Why, I shall have to teach him how to talk!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAnd thereupon she really did amuse herself by telling him the names of\nthe things he touched. He could only stammer, reiterating the syllables,\nand failing to utter a single word plainly. However, she began to walk\nhim about the room, holding him up and leading him from the bed to the\nwindow--quite a long journey. Two or three times he almost fell on the\nway, at which she laughed. One day he fairly sat down on the floor, and\nshe had all the trouble in the world to get him up on his feet again.\nThen she made him undertake the round of the room, letting him rest by\nthe way on the sofa and the chairs--a tour round a little world which\ntook up a good hour. At last he was able to venture on a few steps\nalone. She would stand before him with outstretched hands, and move\nbackwards, calling him, so that he should cross the room in search of\nher supporting arms. If he sulked and refused to walk, she would take\nthe comb from her hair and hold it out to him like a toy. Then he would\ncome to her and sit still in a corner for hours, playing with her comb,\nand gently scratching his hands with its teeth.\n\nAt last one morning she found him up. He had already succeeded in\nopening one of the shutters, and was attempting to walk about without\nleaning on the furniture.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Good gracious, we are active this morning!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she exclaimed gleefully.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Why, he will be jumping out of the window to-morrow if he has his own\nway---- So you are quite strong now, eh?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nSerge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s answer was a childish laugh. His limbs were regaining the\nstrength of adolescence, but more perceptive sensations remained\nunroused. He spent whole afternoons in gazing out on the Paradou,\npouting like a child that sees nought but whiteness and hears but the\nvibration of sounds. He still retained the ignorance of urchinhood--his\nsense of touch as yet so innocent that he failed to tell Albine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gown\nfrom the covers of the old armchairs. His eyes still stared wonderingly;\nhis movements still displayed the wavering hesitation of limbs which\nscarce knew how to reach their goal; his state was one of incipient,\npurely instinctive existence into which entered no knowledge of\nsurroundings. The man was not yet born within him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll act the silly, will you?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 muttered Albine. \u00e2\u0080\u0098We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\nsee.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe took off her comb, and held it out to him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Will you have my comb?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Come and fetch it.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nWhen she had got him out of the room, by retreating before him all the\nway, she put her arm round his waist and helped him down each stair,\namusing him while she put her comb back, even tickling his neck with\na lock of her hair, so that he remained unaware that he was going\ndownstairs. But when he was in the hall, he became frightened at the\ndarkness of the passage.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Just look!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she cried, throwing the door wide open.\n\nIt was like a sudden dawn, a curtain of shadow snatched aside, revealing\nthe joyousness of early day. The park spread out before them verdantly\nlimpid, freshly cool and deep as a spring. Serge, entranced, lingered\nupon the threshold, with a hesitating desire to feel that luminous lake\nwith his foot.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098One would think you were afraid of wetting yourself,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Albine.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be frightened, the ground is safe enough.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe had ventured to take one step, and was astonished at encountering the\nsoft resistance of the gravel. The first touch of the soil gave him a\nshock; life seemed to rebound within him and to set him for a moment\nerect, with expanding frame, while he drew long breaths.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Come now, be brave,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 insisted Albine. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You know you promised me to\ntake five steps. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go as far as the mulberry tree there under the\nwindow---- There you can rest.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nIt took him a quarter of an hour to make those five steps. After each\neffort he stopped as if he had been obliged to tear up roots that held\nhim to the ground.\n\nThe girl, pushing him along, said with a laugh: \u00e2\u0080\u0098You look just like a\nwalking tree.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHaving placed him with his back leaning against the mulberry tree, in\nthe rain of sunlight falling from its boughs, she bounded off and left\nhim, calling out to him that he must not stir. Serge, standing\nthere with drooping hands, slowly turned his head towards the park.\nTerrestrial childhood met his gaze. The pale greenery was steeped in the\nvery milk of youth, flooded with golden brightness. The trees were still\nin infancy, the flowers were as tender-fleshed as babes, the streams\nwere blue with the artless blue of lovely infantile eyes. Beneath every\nleaf was some token of a delightful awakening.\n\nSerge had fixed his eyes upon a yellow breach which a wide path made in\nfront of him amidst a dense mass of foliage. At the very end, eastward,\nsome meadows, steeped in gold, looked like the luminous field upon which\nthe sun would descend, and he waited for the morn to take that path and\nflow towards him. He could feel it coming in a warm breeze, so faint\nat first that it barely brushed across his skin, but rising little by\nlittle, and growing ever brisker till he was thrilled all over. He could\nalso taste it coming with a more and more pronounced savour, bringing\nthe healthful acridity of the open air, holding to his lips a feast of\nsugary aromatics, sour fruits, and milky shoots. Further, he could smell\nit coming with the perfumes which it culled upon its way--the scent of\nearth, the scent of the shady woods, the scent of the warm plants, the\nscent of living animals, a whole posy of scents, powerful enough to\nbring on dizziness. He could likewise hear it coming with the rapid\nflight of a bird skimming over the grass, waking the whole garden from\nsilence, giving voice to all it touched, and filling his ears with the\nmusic of things and beings. Finally, he could see it coming from the end\nof the path, from the meadows steeped in gold--yes, he could see that\nrosy air, so bright that it lighted the way it took with a gleaming\nsmile, no bigger in the distance than a spot of daylight, but in a few\nswift bounds transformed into the very splendour of the sun. And the\nmorn flowed up and beat against the mulberry tree against which Serge\nwas leaning. And he himself resuscitated amidst the childhood of the\nmorn.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Serge! Serge!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cried Albine, lost to sight behind the high shrubs of\nthe flower garden. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be afraid, I am here.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut Serge no longer felt frightened. He was being born anew in the\nsunshine, in that pure bath of light which streamed upon him. He was\nbeing born anew at five-and-twenty, his senses hurriedly unclosing,\nenraptured with the mighty sky, the joyful earth, the prodigy of\nloveliness spread out around him. This garden, which he knew not only\nthe day before, now afforded him boundless delight. Everything filled\nhim with ecstasy, even the blades of grass, the pebbles in the paths,\nthe invisible puffs of air that flitted over his cheeks. His whole body\nentered into possession of this stretch of nature; he embraced it\nwith his limbs, he drank it in with his lips, he inhaled it with his\nnostrils, he carried it in his ears and hid it in the depths of his\neyes. It was his own. The roses of the flower garden, the lofty boughs\nof the forest, the resounding rocks of the waterfall, the meadows which\nthe sun planted with blades of light, were his. Then he closed his eyes\nand slowly reopened them that he might enjoy the dazzle of a second\nwakening.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The birds have eaten all the strawberries,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Albine disconsolately,\nas she ran up to him. \u00e2\u0080\u0098See, I have only been able to find these two!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut she stopped short a few steps away, heart-struck and gazing at Serge\nwith rapturous astonishment. \u00e2\u0080\u0098How handsome you are!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she cried.\n\nShe drew a little nearer; then stood there, absorbed in her\ncontemplation, and murmuring: \u00e2\u0080\u0098I had never, never seen you before.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe had certainly grown taller. Clothed in a loose garment, he stood\nerect, still somewhat slender, with finely moulded limbs, square chest,\nand rounded shoulders. His head, slightly thrown back, was poised upon\na flexible and snowy neck, rimmed with brown behind. Health and strength\nand power were on his face. He did not smile, his expression was that of\nrepose, with grave and tender mouth, firm cheeks, large nose, and grey,\nclear, commanding eyes. The long locks that thickly covered his head\nfell upon his shoulders in jetty curls; while a slender growth of hair,\nthrough which gleamed his white skin, curled upon his upper lip and\nchin.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh! how handsome, how handsome you are!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 lingeringly repeated Albine,\ncrouching at his feet and gazing up at him with loving eyes. \u00e2\u0080\u0098But why\nare you sulking with me? Why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you speak to me?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nStill he stood there and made no answer. His eyes were far away; he\nnever even saw that child at his feet. He spoke to himself in the\nsunlight, and said: \u00e2\u0080\u0098How good the light is!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThat utterance sounded like a vibration of the sunlight itself. It fell\namid the silence in the faintest of whispers like a musical sigh, a\nquiver of warmth and of life. For several days Albine had never heard\nhis voice, and now, like himself, it had altered. It seemed to her to\ncourse through the park more sweetly than the melody of birds, more\nimperiously than the wind that bends the boughs. It reigned, it ruled.\nThe whole garden heard it, though it had been but a faint and passing\nbreath, and the whole garden was thrilled with the joyousness it\nbrought.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Speak to me,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 implored Albine. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You have never spoken to me like that.\nWhen you were upstairs in your room, when you were not dumb, you talked\nthe silly prattle of a child. How is it I no longer know your voice?\nJust now I thought it had come down from the trees, that it reached me\nfrom every part of the garden, that it was one of those deep sighs that\nused to worry me at night before you came. Listen, everything is keeping\nsilence to hear you speak again.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut still he failed to recognise her presence. Tenderer grew her tones.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t speak if it tires you. Sit down beside me, and we will\nremain here on the grass till the sun wanes. And look, I have found two\nstrawberries. Such trouble I had too! The birds eat up everything. One\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nfor you, both if you like; or we can halve them, and taste each of them.\nYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll thank me, and then I shall hear you.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut he would not sit down, he refused the strawberries, which Albine\npettishly threw away. She did not open her lips again. She would rather\nhave seen him ill, as in those earlier days when she had given him her\nhand for a pillow, and had felt him coming back to life beneath the\ncooling breath she blew upon his face. She cursed the returning health\nwhich now made him stand in the light like a young unheeding god. Would\nhe be ever thus then, with never a glance for her? Would he never be\nfurther healed, and at last see her and love her? And she dreamed of\nonce again being his healer, of accomplishing by the sole power of her\nlittle hands the cure of the second childhood in which he remained.\nShe could clearly see that there was no spark in the depths of his grey\neyes, that his was but a pallid beauty like that of the statues which\nhad fallen among the nettles of the flower-garden. She rose and clasped\nhim, breathing on his neck to rouse him. But that morning Serge never\neven felt the breath that lifted his silky beard. The sun got low, it\nwas time to go indoors. On reaching his room, Albine burst into tears.\n\nFrom that morning forward the invalid took a short walk in the garden\nevery day. He went past the mulberry tree, as far as the edge of the\nterrace, where a wide flight of broken steps descended to the flowery\nparterre. He grew accustomed to the open air, each bath of sunlight\nbrought him fresh vigour. A young chestnut tree, which had sprung from\nsome fallen nut between two stones of the balustrade, burst the resin\nof its buds, and unfolded its leafy fans with far less vigour than he\nprogressed. One day, indeed, he even attempted to descend the steps,\nbut in this his strength failed him, and he sat down among the dane-wort\nwhich had grown up between the cracks in the stone flags. Below, to the\nleft, he could see a small wood of roses. It was thither that he dreamt\nof going.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Wait a little longer,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Albine. \u00e2\u0080\u0098The scent of the roses is too\nstrong for you yet. I have never been able to sit long under the\nrose-trees without feeling exhausted, light-headed, with a longing to\ncry. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be afraid, I will some day lead you to the rose-trees, and I\nshall surely weep among them, for you make me very sad.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\nOne morning she at last succeeded in helping him to the foot of the\nsteps, trampling down the grass before him with her feet, and clearing\na way for him through the briars, whose supple arms barred the last few\nyards. Then they slowly entered the wood of roses. It was indeed a very\nwood, with thickets of tall standard roses throwing out leafy clumps as\nbig as trees, and enormous rose bushes impenetrable as copses of young\noaks. Here, formerly, there had been a most marvellous collection\nof plants. But since the flower garden had been left in abandonment,\neverything had run wild, and a virgin forest had arisen, a forest of\nroses over-running the paths, crowded with wild offshoots, so mingled,\nso blended, that roses of every scent and hue seemed to blossom on the\nsame stem. Creeping roses formed mossy carpets on the ground, while\nclimbing roses clung to others like greedy ivy plants, and ascended in\nspindles of verdure, letting a shower of their loosened petals fall\nat the lightest breeze. Natural paths coursed through the wood--narrow\nfootways, broad avenues, enchanting covered walks in which one strolled\nin the shade and scent. These led to glades and clearings, under bowers\nof small red roses, and between walls hung with tiny yellow ones. Some\nsunny nooks gleamed like green silken stuff embroidered with bright\npatterns; other shadier corners offered the seclusion of alcoves and an\naroma of love, the balmy warmth, as it were, of a posy languishing on a\nwoman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bosom. The rose bushes had whispering voices too. And the rose\nbushes were full of songbirds\u00e2\u0080\u0099 nests.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098We must take care not to lose ourselves,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Albine, as she entered\nthe wood. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I did lose myself once, and the sun had set before I was\nable to free myself from the rose bushes which caught me by the skirt at\nevery step.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThey had barely walked a few minutes, however, before Serge, worn out\nwith fatigue, wished to sit down. He stretched himself upon the ground,\nand fell into deep slumber. Albine sat musing by his side. They were on\nthe edge of a glade, near a narrow path which stretched away through the\nwood, streaked with flashes of sunlight, and, through a small round blue\ngap at its far end, revealed the sky. Other little paths led from the\nclearing into leafy recesses. The glade was formed of tall rose bushes\nrising one above the other with such a wealth of branches, such a tangle\nof thorny shoots, that big patches of foliage were caught aloft, and\nhung there tent-like, stretching out from bush to bush. Through the tiny\napertures in the patches of leaves, which were suggestive of fine lace,\nthe light filtered like impalpable sunny dust. And from the vaulted roof\nhung stray branches, chandeliers, as it were, thick clusters suspended\nfrom green thread-like stems, armfuls of flowers that reached to the\nground, athwart some rent in the leafy ceiling, which trailed around\nlike a tattered curtain.\n\nAlbine meanwhile was gazing at Serge asleep. She had never seen him so\nutterly prostrated in body as now, his hands lying open on the turf, his\nface deathly. So dead indeed he was to her that she thought she could\nkiss his face without his even feeling it. And sadly, absently, she\nbusied her hands with shredding all the roses within her reach. Above\nher head drooped an enormous cluster which brushed against her hair, set\nroses on her twisted locks, her ears, her neck, and even threw a mantle\nof the fragrant flowers across her shoulders. Higher up, under\nher fingers, other roses rained down with large and tender petals\nexquisitely formed, which in hue suggested the faintly flushing purity\nof a maiden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bosom. Like a living snowfall these roses already hid her\nfeet in the grass. And they climbed her knees, covered her skirt,\nand smothered her to her waist; while three stray petals, which had\nfluttered on to her bodice, just above her bosom, there looked like\nthree glimpses of her bewitching skin.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh! the lazy fellow!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she murmured, feeling bored and picking up two\nhandfuls of roses, which she flung in Serge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face to wake him.\n\nHe did not stir, however, but still lay there with the roses on his eyes\nand mouth. This made Albine laugh. She stooped down, and with her whole\nheart kissed both his eyes and his mouth, blowing as she kissed to drive\nthe rose petals away; but they remained upon his lips, and she broke\ninto still louder laughter, intensely amused at this flowery caressing.\n\nSerge slowly raised himself. He gazed at her with amazement, as if\nstartled at finding her there.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Who are you? where do you come from? what are you doing here beside\nme?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he asked her. And still she smiled, transported with delight\nat marking this awakening of his senses. Then he seemed to remember\nsomething, and continued with a gesture of happy confidence:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I know, you are my love, flesh of my flesh, you are waiting for me that\nwe may be one for ever. I was dreaming of you. You were in my breast,\nand I gave you my blood, my muscles, my bones. I felt no pain. You took\nhalf my heart so tenderly that I experienced keen inward delight at thus\ndividing myself. I sought all that was best and most beautiful within\nme to give it to you. You might have carried off everything, and still\nI should have thanked you. And I woke when you went out of me. You\nleft through my eyes and mouth; ay, I felt it. You were all warm, all\nfragrant, so sweet that it was the thrill from you that has made me\nawake.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAlbine listened to his words with ecstasy. At last he saw her; at last\nhis birth was accomplished, his cure begun. With outstretched hands she\nbegged him to go on.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098How have I managed to live without you?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he murmured. \u00e2\u0080\u0098No, I did not\nlive, I was like a slumbering animal. And now you are mine! and you are\nno one but myself! Listen, you must never leave me; for you are my very\nbreath, and in leaving me you would rob me of my life. We will remain\nwithin ourselves. You will be mine even as I shall be yours. Should I\never forsake you, may I be accursed, may my body wither like a useless\nand noxious weed!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe caught hold of her hands, and exclaimed in a voice quivering with\nadmiration: \u00e2\u0080\u0098How beautiful you are!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nIn the falling dust of sunshine Albine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s skin looked milky white, scarce\ngilded here and there by the sunny sheen. The shower of roses around and\non her steeped her in pinkness.\n\nHer fair hair, loosely held together by her comb, decked her head as\nwith a setting planet whose last bright sparks shone upon the nape of\nher neck. She wore a white gown; her arms, her throat, her stainless\nskin bloomed unabashed as a flower, musky with a goodly fragrance. Her\nfigure was slender, not too tall, but supple as a snake\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, with softly\nrounded, voluptuously expanding outlines, in which the freshness of\nchildhood mingled with womanhood\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nascent charms. Her oval face, with\nits narrow brow and rather full mouth, beamed with the tender living\nlight of her blue eyes. And yet she was grave, too, her cheeks\nunruffled, her chin plump--as naturally lovely as are the trees.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And how I love you!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Serge, drawing her to himself.\n\nThey were wholly one another\u00e2\u0080\u0099s now, clasped in each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arms! They\ndid not kiss, but held each other round the waist, cheek to cheek,\nunited, dumb, delighted with their oneness. Around them bloomed the\nroses with a mad, amorous blossoming, full of crimson and rosy and white\nlaughter. The living, opening flowers seemed to bare their very bosoms.\nYellow roses were there showing the golden skin of barbarian maidens:\nstraw-coloured roses, lemon-coloured roses, sun-coloured roses--every\nshade of the necks which are ambered by glowing skies. Then there was\nskin of softer hue: among the tea roses, bewitchingly moist and cool,\none caught glimpses of modest, bashful charms, with skin as fine as silk\ntinged faintly with a blue network of veins. Farther on all the smiling\nlife of the rose expanded: there was the blush white rose, barely\ntinged with a dash of carmine, snowy as the foot of a maid dabbling in a\nspring; there was the silvery pink, more subdued than even the glow\nwith which a youthful arm irradiates a wide sleeve; there was the clear,\nfresh rose, in which blood seemed to gleam under satin as in the bare\nshoulders of a woman bathed in light; and there was the bright pink rose\nwith its buds like the nipples of virgin bosoms, and its opening flowers\nthat suggested parted lips, exhaling warm and perfumed breath. And\nthe climbing roses, the tall cluster roses with their showers of white\nflowers, clothed all these others with the lacework of their bunches,\nthe innocence of their flimsy muslin; while, here and there, roses dark\nas the lees of wine, sanguineous, almost black, showed amidst the bridal\npurity like passion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wounds. Verily, it was like a bridal--the bridal\nof the fragrant wood, the virginity of May led to the fertility of\nJuly and August; the first unknowing kiss culled like a nosegay on\nthe wedding morn. Even in the grass, moss roses, clad in close-fitting\ngarments of green wool, seemed to be awaiting the advent of love.\nFlowers rambled all along the sun-streaked path, faces peeped out\neverywhere to court the passing breezes. Bright were the smiles under\nthe spreading tent of the glade. Not a flower that bloomed the same: the\nroses differed in the fashion of their wooing. Some, shy and blushing,\nwould show but a glimpse of bud, while others, panting and wide open,\nseemed consumed with infatuation for their persons. There were pert,\ngay little things that filed off, cockade in cap; there were huge ones,\nbursting with sensuous charms, like portly, fattened-up sultanas; there\nwere impudent hussies, too, in coquettish disarray, on whose petals the\nwhite traces of the powder-puff could be espied; there were virtuous\nmaids who had donned low-necked garb like demure _bourgeoises_; and\naristocratic ladies, graceful and original, who contrived attractive\ndeshabilles. And the cup-like roses offered their perfume as in precious\ncrystal; the drooping, urn-shaped roses let it drip drop by drop; the\nround, cabbage-like roses exhaled it with the even breath of slumbering\nflowers; while the budding roses tightly locked their petals and only\nsent forth as yet the faint sigh of maidenhood.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I love you, I love you,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 softly repeated Serge.\n\nAlbine, too, was a large rose, a pallid rose that had opened since the\nmorning. Her feet were white, her arms were rosy pink, her neck was fair\nof skin, her throat bewitchingly veined, pale and exquisite. She was\nfragrant, she proffered lips which offered as in a coral cup a perfume\nthat was yet faint and cool. Serge inhaled that perfume, and pressed her\nto his breast. Albine laughed.\n\nThe ring of that laugh, which sounded like a bird\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rhythmic notes,\nenraptured Serge.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What, that lovely song is yours?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It is the sweetest I ever\nheard. You are indeed my joy.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen she laughed yet more sonorously, pouring forth rippling scales of\nhigh-pitched, flute-like notes that melted into deeper ones. It was an\nendless laugh, a long-drawn cooing, then a burst of triumphant music\ncelebrating the delight of awakening love. And everything--the roses,\nthe fragrant wood, the whole of the Paradou--laughed in that laugh of\nwoman just born to beauty and to love. Till now the vast garden had\nlacked one charm--a winning voice which should prove the living mirth\nof the trees, the streams, and the sunlight. Now the vast garden was\nendowed with that charm of laughter.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098How old are you?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 asked Albine, when her song had ended in a faint\nexpiring note.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Nearly twenty-six,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Serge answered.\n\nShe was amazed. What! he was twenty-six! He, too, was astonished at\nhaving made that answer so glibly, for it seemed to him that he had not\nyet lived a day--an hour.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And how old are you?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he asked in his turn.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh, I am sixteen.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen she broke into laughter again, quivering from head to foot,\nrepeating and singing her age. She laughed at her sixteen years with a\nfine-drawn laugh that flowed on with rhythmic trilling like a streamlet.\nSerge scanned her closely, amazed at the laughing life that transfigured\nher face. He scarcely knew her now with those dimples in her cheeks,\nthose bow-shaped lips between which peeped the rosy moistness of her\nmouth, and those eyes blue like bits of sky kindling with the rising of\nthe sun. As she threw back her head, she sent a glow of warmth through\nhim.\n\nHe put out his hand, and fumbled mechanically behind her neck.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What do you want?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she asked. And suddenly remembering, she exclaimed:\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098My comb! my comb! that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe gave him her comb, and let fall her heavy tresses. A cloth of gold\nsuddenly unrolled and clothed her to her hips. Some locks which flowed\ndown upon her breast gave, as it were a finishing touch to her\nregal raiment. At the sight of that sudden blaze, Serge uttered an\nexclamation; he kissed each lock, and burned his lips amidst that\nsunset-like refulgence.\n\nBut Albine now relieved herself of her long silence, and chatted and\nquestioned unceasingly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh, how wretched you made me! You no longer took any notice of me, and\nday after day I found myself useless and powerless, worried out of my\nwits like a good-for-nothing.... And yet the first few days I had done\nyou good. You saw me and spoke to me.... Do you remember when you were\nlying down, and went to sleep on my shoulder, and murmured that I did\nyou good?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Serge, \u00e2\u0080\u0098no, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remember it. I had never seen you before.\nI have only just seen you for the first time--lovely, radiant, never to\nbe forgotten.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe clapped her hands impatiently, exclaiming: \u00e2\u0080\u0098And my comb? You must\nremember how I used to give you my comb to keep you quiet when you were\na little child? Why, you were looking for it just now.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remember. Your hair is like fine silk. I have never kissed\nyour hair before.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAt this, with some vexation, she recounted certain particulars of his\nconvalescence in the room with the blue ceiling. But he only laughed\nat her, and at last closed her lips with his hand, saying with anxious\nweariness: \u00e2\u0080\u0098No, be quiet, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know; I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to know any\nmore.... I have only just woke up, and found you there, covered with\nroses. That is enough.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAnd he drew her once more towards him and held her there, dreaming\naloud, and murmuring: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Perhaps I have lived before. It must have been a\nlong, long time ago.... I loved you in a painful dream. You had the same\nblue eyes, the same rather long face, the same youthful mien. But your\nhair was carefully hidden under a linen cloth, and I never dared to\nremove that cloth, because your locks seemed to me fearsome and\nwould have made me die. But to-day your hair is the very sweetness of\nyourself. It preserves your scent, and when I kiss it, when I bury my\nface in it like this, I drink in your very life.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe kept on passing the long curls through his hands, and pressing them\nto his lips, as if to squeeze from them all Albine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blood. And after\nan interval of silence, he continued: \u00e2\u0080\u0098It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strange, before one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s birth,\none dreams of being born.... I was buried somewhere. I was very cold.\nI could hear all the life of the world outside buzzing above me. But I\nshut my ears despairingly, for I was used to my gloomy den, and enjoyed\nsome fearful delights in it, so that I never sought to free myself from\nall the earth weighing upon my chest. Where could I have been then? Who\nwas it gave me light?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe struggled to remember, while Albine now waited in fear and trembling\nlest he should really do so. Smiling, she took a handful of her hair and\nwound it round the young man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s neck, thus fastening him to herself. This\nplayful act roused him from his musings.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re right,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I am yours, what does the rest matter? It was\nyou, was it not, who drew me out of the earth? I must have been under\nthis garden. What I heard were your steps rattling the little pebbles\nin the path. You were looking for me, you brought down upon my head the\nsongs of the birds, the scent of the pinks, the warmth of the sun. I\nfancied that you would find me at last. I waited a long time for you.\nBut I never expected that you would give yourself to me without your\nveil, with your hair undone--the terrible hair which has become so\nsoft.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe sat her on his lap, placing his face beside hers.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Do not let us talk any more. We are alone for ever. We love each\nother.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAnd thus in all innocence they lingered in each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arms; for a\nlong, long time did they remain there forgetfully. The sun rose higher;\nand the dust of light fell hotter from the lofty boughs. The yellow and\nwhite and crimson roses were now only a ray of their delight, a sign\nof their smiles to one another. They had certainly caused buds to open\naround them. The roses crowned their heads and threw garlands about\ntheir waists. And the scent of the roses became so penetrating, so\nstrong with amorous emotion, that it seemed to be the scent of their own\nbreath.\n\nAt last Serge put up Albine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hair. He raised it in handfuls with\ndelightful awkwardness, and stuck her comb askew in the enormous\nknot that he had heaped upon her head. And as it happened she looked\nbewitching thus. Then, rising from the ground, he held out his hands to\nher, and supported her waist as she got up. They still smiled without\nspeaking a word, and slowly they went down the path.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\nAlbine and Serge entered the flower garden. She was watching him\nwith tender anxiety, fearing lest he should overtire himself; but he\nreassured her with a light laugh. He felt strong enough indeed to carry\nher whithersoever she listed. When he found himself once more in the\nfull sunlight, he drew a sigh of content. At last he lived; he was no\nlonger a plant subject to the terrible sufferings of winter. And how he\nwas moved with loving gratitude! Had it been within his power, he would\nhave spared Albine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tiny feet even the roughness of the paths; he\ndreamed of carrying her, clinging round his neck, like a child lulled\nto sleep by her mother. He already watched over her with a guardian\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nwatchful care, thrusting aside the stones and brambles, jealous lest the\nbreeze should waft a fleeting kiss upon those darling locks which were\nhis alone. She on her side nestled against his shoulder and serenely\nyielded to his guidance.\n\nThus Albine and Serge strolled on together in the sunlight for the first\ntime. A balmy fragrance floated in their wake, the very path on which\nthe sun had unrolled a golden carpet thrilled with delight under their\nfeet. Between the tall flowering shrubs they passed like a vision of\nsuch wondrous charm that the distant paths seemed to entreat their\npresence and hail them with a murmur of admiration, even as crowds hail\nlong-expected sovereigns. They formed one sole, supremely lovely being.\nAlbine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s snowy skin was but the whiteness of Serge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s browner skin.\nAnd slowly they passed along clothed with sunlight--nay, they were\nthemselves the sun--worshipped by the low bending flowers.\n\nA tide of emotion now stirred the Paradou to its depths. The old flower\ngarden escorted them--that vast field bearing a century\u00e2\u0080\u0099s untrammelled\ngrowth, that nook of Paradise sown by the breeze with the choicest\nflowers. The blissful peace of the Paradou, slumbering in the broad\nsunlight, prevented the degeneration of species. It could boast of a\ntemperature ever equable, and a soil which every plant had long enriched\nto thrive therein in the silence of its vigour. Its vegetation was\nmighty, magnificent, luxuriantly untended, full of erratic growths\ndecked with monstrous blossoming, unknown to the spade and watering-pot\nof gardeners. Nature left to herself, free to grow as she listed, in the\ndepths of that solitude protected by natural shelters, threw restraint\naside more heartily at each return of spring, indulged in mighty\ngambols, delighted in offering herself at all seasons strange nosegays\nnot meant for any hand to pluck. A rabid fury seemed to impel her to\noverthrow whatever the effort of man had created; she rebelliously cast\na straggling multitude of flowers over the paths, attacked the rockeries\nwith an ever-rising tide of moss, and knotted round the necks of marble\nstatues the flexible cords of creepers with which she threw them down;\nshe shattered the stonework of the fountains, steps, and terraces with\nshrubs which burst through them; she slowly, creepingly, spread over the\nsmallest cultivated plots, moulding them to her fancy, and planting on\nthem, as ensign of rebellion, some wayside spore, some lowly weed which\nshe transformed into a gigantic growth of verdure. In days gone by the\nparterre, tended by a master passionately fond of flowers, had displayed\nin its trim beds and borders a wondrous wealth of choice blossoms. And\nthe same plants could still be found; but perpetuated, grown into such\nnumberless families, and scampering in such mad fashion throughout the\nwhole garden, that the place was now all helter-skelter riot to its very\nwalls, a very den of debauchery, where intoxicated nature had hiccups of\nverbena and pinks.\n\nThough to outward seeming Albine had yielded her weaker self to the\nguidance of Serge, to whose shoulder she clung, it was she who really\nled him. She took him first to the grotto. Deep within a clump of\npoplars and willows gaped a cavern, formed by rugged bits of rocks which\nhad fallen over a basin where tiny rills of water trickled between the\nstones. The grotto was completely lost to sight beneath the onslaught of\nvegetation. Below, row upon row of hollyhocks seemed to bar all entrance\nwith a trellis-work of red, yellow, mauve, and white-hued flowers, whose\nstems were hidden among colossal bronze-green nettles, which calmly\nexuded blistering poison. Above them was a mighty swarm of creepers\nwhich leaped aloft in a few bounds; jasmines starred with balmy flowers;\nwistarias with delicate lacelike leaves; dense ivy, dentated and\nresembling varnished metal; lithe honeysuckle, laden with pale coral\nsprays; amorous clematideae, reaching out arms all tufted with white\naigrettes. And among them twined yet slenderer plants, binding them\nmore and more closely together, weaving them into a fragrant woof.\nNasturtium, bare and green of skin, showed open mouths of ruddy gold;\nscarlet runners, tough as whipcord, kindled here and there a fire of\ngleaming sparks; convolvuli opened their heart-shaped leaves, and with\nthousands of little bells rang a silent peal of exquisite colours;\nsweetpeas, like swarms of settling butterflies, folded tawny or rosy\nwings, ready to be borne yet farther away by the first breeze. It\nwas all a wealth of leafy locks, sprinkled with a shower of flowers,\nstraying away in wild dishevelment, and suggesting the head of some\ngiantess thrown back in a spasm of passion, with a streaming of\nmagnificent hair, which spread into a pool of perfume.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I have never dared to venture into all that darkness,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Albine whispered\nto Serge.\n\nHe urged her on, carried her over the nettles; and as a great boulder\nbarred the way into the grotto, he held her up for a moment in his arms\nso that she might be able to peer through the opening that yawned at a\nfew feet from the ground.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098A marble woman,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she whispered, \u00e2\u0080\u0098has fallen full length into the\nstream. The water has eaten her face away.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen he, too, in his turn wanted to look, and pulled himself up. A cold\nbreeze played upon his cheeks. In the pale light that glided through the\nhole, he saw the marble woman lying amidst the reeds and the duckweed.\nShe was naked to the waist. She must have been drowning there for the\nlast hundred years. Some grief had probably flung her into that spring\nwhere she was slowly committing suicide. The clear water which flowed\nover her had worn her face into a smooth expanse of marble, a mere white\nsurface without a feature; but her breasts, raised out of the water by\nwhat appeared an effort of her neck, were still perfect and lifelike,\nthrobbing even yet with the joys of some old delight.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098She isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t dead yet,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Serge, getting down again. \u00e2\u0080\u0098One day we will\ncome and get her out of there.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut Albine shuddered and led him away. They passed out again into the\nsunlight and the rank luxuriance of beds and borders. They wandered\nthrough a field of flowers capriciously, at random. Their feet trod a\ncarpet of lovely dwarf plants, which had once neatly fringed the walks,\nand now spread about in wild profusion. In succession they passed\nankle-deep through the spotted silk of soft rose catchflies, through the\ntufted satin of feathered pinks, and the blue velvet of forget-me-nots,\nstudded with melancholy little eyes. Further on they forced their way\nthrough giant mignonette, which rose to their knees like a bath of\nperfume; then they turned through a patch of lilies of the valley in\norder that they might spare an expanse of violets, so delicate-looking\nthat they feared to hurt them. But soon they found themselves surrounded\non all sides by violets, and so with wary, gentle steps they passed over\ntheir fresh fragrance inhaling the very breath of springtide. Beyond the\nviolets, a mass of lobelias spread out like green wool gemmed with\npale mauve. The softly shaded stars of globularia, the blue cups of\nnemophila, the yellow crosses of saponaria, the white and purple ones\nof sweet rocket, wove patches of rich tapestry, stretching onward and\nonward, a fabric of royal luxury, so that the young couple might enjoy\nthe delights of that first walk together without fatigue. But the\nviolets ever reappeared; real seas of violets that rolled all round\nthem, shedding the sweetest perfumes beneath their feet and wafting in\ntheir wake the breath of their leaf-hidden flowerets.\n\nAlbine and Serge quite lost themselves. Thousands of loftier plants\ntowered up in hedges around them, enclosing narrow paths which they\nfound it delightful to thread. These paths twisted and turned, wandered\nmaze-like through dense thickets. There were ageratums with sky-blue\ntufts of bloom; woodruffs with soft musky perfume; brazen-throated\nmimuluses, blotched with bright vermilion; lofty phloxes, crimson and\nviolet, throwing up distaffs of flowers for the breezes to spin; red\nflax with sprays as fine as hair; chrysanthemums like full golden moons,\ncasting short faint rays, white and violet and rose, around them. The\nyoung couple surmounted all the obstacles that lay in their path and\ncontinued their way betwixt the walls of verdure. To the right of\nthem sprang up the slim fraxinella, the centranthus draped with\nsnowy blossoms, and the greyish hounds-tongue, in each of whose tiny\nflowercups gleamed a dewdrop. To their left was a long row of columbines\nof every variety; white ones, pale rose ones, and some of deep violet\nhues, almost black, that seemed to be in mourning, the blossoms that\ndrooped from their lofty, branching stems being plaited and goffered\nlike crape. Then, as they advanced further on, the character of the\nhedges changed. Giant larkspurs thrust up their flower-rods, between the\ndentated foliage of which gaped the mouths of tawny snapdragons, while\nthe schizanthus reared its scanty leaves and fluttering blooms, that\nlooked like butterflies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 wings of sulphur hue splashed with soft lake.\nThe blue bells of campanulae swayed aloft, some of them even over the\ntall asphodels, whose golden stems served as their steeples. In one\ncorner was a giant fennel that reminded one of a lace-dressed lady\nspreading out a sunshade of sea-green satin. Then the pair suddenly\nfound their way blocked. It was impossible to advance any further;\na mass of flowers, a huge sheaf of plants stopped all progress. Down\nbelow, a mass of brank-ursine formed as it were a pedestal, from the\nmidst of which sprang scarlet geum, rhodanthe with stiff petals, and\nclarkia with great white carved crosses, that looked like the insignia\nof some barbarous order. Higher up still, bloomed the rosy viscaria,\nthe yellow leptosiphon, the white colinsia, and the lagurus, whose dusty\ngreen bloom contrasted with the glowing colours around it. Towering over\nall these growths scarlet foxgloves and blue lupins, rising in slender\ncolumns, formed a sort of oriental rotunda gleaming vividly with crimson\nand azure; while at the very summit, like a surmounting dome of dusky\ncopper, were the ruddy leaves of a colossal castor-bean.\n\nAs Serge reached out his hands to try to force a passage, Albine stopped\nhim and begged him not to injure the flowers. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You will break the stems\nand crush the leaves,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Ever since I have been here, I have\nalways taken care to hurt none of them. Come, and I will show you the\npansies.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe made him turn and led him from the narrow paths to the centre of the\nparterre, where, once upon a time, great basins had been hollowed\nout. But these had now fallen into ruin, and were nothing but gigantic\n_jardinieres_, fringed with stained and cracked marble. In one of the\nlargest of them, the wind had sown a wonderful basketful of pansies.\nThe velvety blooms seemed almost like living faces, with bands of violet\nhair, yellow eyes, paler tinted mouths, and chins of a delicate flesh\ncolour.\n\nWhen I was younger they used to make me quite afraid,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 murmured Albine.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Look at them. Wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you think that they were thousands of little\nfaces looking up at you from the ground? And they turn, too, all in\nthe same direction. They might be a lot of buried dolls thrusting their\nheads out of the ground.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe led him still further on. They went the round of all the other\nbasins. In the next one a number of amaranthuses had sprung up, raising\nmonstrous crests which Albine had always shrunk from touching, such was\ntheir resemblance to big bleeding caterpillars. Balsams of all colours,\nnow straw-coloured, now the hue of peach-blossom, now blush-white, now\ngrey like flax, filled another basin where their seed pods split with\nlittle snaps. Then in the midst of a ruined fountain, there flourished\na colony of splendid carnations. White ones hung over the moss-covered\nrims, and flaked ones thrust a bright medley of blossom between the\nchinks of the marble; while from the mouth of the lion, whence formerly\nthe water-jets had spurted, a huge crimson clove now shot out so\nvigorously that the decrepit beast seemed to be spouting blood. Near by,\nthe principal piece of ornamental water, a lake, on whose surface swans\nhad glided, had now become a thicket of lilacs, beneath whose shade\nstocks and verbenas and day-lilies screened their delicate tints, and\ndozed away, all redolent of perfume.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen half the flowers yet,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Albine, proudly. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Over\nyonder there are such huge ones that I can quite bury myself amongst\nthem like a partridge in a corn-field.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThey went thither. They tripped down some broad steps, from whose fallen\nurns still flickered the violet fires of the iris. All down the steps\nstreamed gilliflowers, like liquid gold. The sides were flanked with\nthistles, that shot up like candelabra, of green bronze, twisted and\ncurved into the semblance of birds\u00e2\u0080\u0099 heads, with all the fantastic\nelegance of Chinese incense-burners. Between the broken balustrades\ndrooped tresses of stonecrop, light greenish locks, spotted as with\nmouldiness. Then at the foot of the steps another parterre spread out,\ndotted over with box-trees that were vigorous as oaks; box-trees which\nhad once been carefully pruned and clipped into balls and pyramids and\noctagonal columns, but which were now revelling in unrestrained freedom\nof untidiness, breaking out into ragged masses of greenery, through\nwhich blue patches of sky were visible.\n\nAnd Albine led Serge straight on to a spot that seemed to be the\ngraveyard of the flower-garden. There the scabious mourned, and\nprocessions of poppies stretched out in line, with deathly odour,\nunfolding heavy blooms of feverish brilliance. Sad anemones clustered in\nweary throngs, pallid as if infected by some epidemic. Thick-set daturas\nspread out purplish horns, from which insects, weary of life, sucked\nfatal poison. Marigolds buried with choking foliage their writhing\nstarry flowers, that already reeked of putrefaction. And there were\nother melancholy flowers also: fleshy ranunculi with rusty tints,\nhyacinths and tuberoses that exhaled asphyxia and died from their own\nperfume. But the cinerarias were most conspicuous, crowding thickly in\nhalf-mourning robes of violet and white. In the middle of this gloomy\nspot a mutilated marble Cupid still remained standing, smiling beneath\nthe lichens which overspread his youthful nakedness, while the arm with\nwhich he had once held his bow lay low amongst the nettles.\n\nThen Albine and Serge passed on through a rank growth of peonies,\nreaching to their waists. The white flowers fell to pieces as they\npassed, with a rain of snowy petals which was as refreshing to their\nhands as the heavy drops of a thunder shower. And the red ones grinned\nwith apoplectical faces which perturbed them. Next they passed through\na field of fuchsias, forming dense, vigorous shrubs that delighted them\nwith their countless bells. Then they went on through fields of purple\nveronicas and others of geraniums, blazing with all the fiery tints of\na brasier, which the wind seemed to be ever fanning into fresh heat. And\nthey forced their way through a jungle of gladioli, tall as reeds, which\nthrew up spikes of flowers that gleamed in the full daylight with all\nthe brilliance of burning torches. They lost themselves too in a forest\nof sunflowers, with stalks as thick as Albine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wrist, a forest darkened\nby rough leaves large enough to form an infant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bed, and peopled with\ngiant starry faces that shone like so many suns. And thence they passed\ninto another forest, a forest of rhododendrons so teeming with blossom\nthat the branches and leaves were completely hidden, and nothing but\nhuge nosegays, masses of soft calyces, could be seen as far as the eye\ncould reach.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Come along; we have not got to the end yet,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cried Albine. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Let us push\non.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut Serge stopped. They were now in the midst of an old ruined\ncolonnade. Some of the columns offered inviting seats as they lay\nprostrate amongst primroses and periwinkles. Further away, among the\ncolumns that still remained upright, other flowers were growing in\nprofusion. There were expanses of tulips showing brilliant streaks like\npainted china; expanses of calceolarias dotted with crimson and gold;\nexpanses of zinnias like great daisies; expanses of petunias with petals\nlike soft cambric through which rosy flesh tints gleamed; and other\nfields, with flowers they could not recognise spreading in carpets\nbeneath the sun, in a motley brilliance that was softened by the green\nof their leaves.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098We shall never be able to see it all,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Serge, smiling and waving\nhis hand. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It would be very nice to sit down here, amongst all this\nperfume.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nNear them there was a large patch of heliotropes, whose vanilla-like\nbreath permeated the air with velvety softness. They sat down upon one\nof the fallen columns, in the midst of a cluster of magnificent lilies\nwhich had shot up there. They had been walking for more than an hour.\nThey had wandered on through the flowers from the roses to the lilies.\nThese offered them a calm, quiet haven after their lovers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ramble amid\nthe perfumed solicitations of luscious honeysuckle, musky violets,\nverbenas that breathed out the warm scent of kisses, and tuberoses that\npanted with voluptuous passion. The lilies, with their tall slim stems,\nshot up round them like a white pavilion and sheltered them with snowy\ncups, gleaming only with the gold of their slender pistils. And\nthere they rested, like betrothed children in a tower of purity; an\nimpregnable ivory tower, where all their love was yet perfect innocence.\n\nAlbine and Serge lingered amongst the lilies till evening. They felt\nso happy there, and seemed to break out into a new life. Serge felt the\nlast trace of fever leave his hands, while Albine grew quite white, with\na milky whiteness untinted by any rosy hue. They were unconscious\nthat their arms and necks and shoulders were bare, and their straying\nunconfined hair in nowise troubled them. They laughed merrily one at the\nother, with frank open laughter. The expression of their eyes retained\nthe limpid calmness of clear spring water. When they quitted the lilies,\ntheir feelings were but those of children ten years old; it seemed to\nthem that they had just met each other in that garden so that they might\nbe friends for ever and amuse themselves with perpetual play. And as\nthey returned through the parterre, the very flowers bore themselves\ndiscreetly, as though they were glad to see their childishness, and\nwould do nothing that might corrupt them. The forests of peonies, the\nmasses of carnations, the carpets of forget-me-nots, the curtains\nof clematis now steeped in the atmosphere of evening, slumbering in\nchildlike purity akin to their own, no longer spread suggestions of\nvoluptuousness around them. The pansies looked up at them with their\nlittle candid faces, like playfellows; and the languid mignonette, as\nAlbine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s white skirt brushed by it, seemed full of compassion, and held\nits breath lest it should fan their love prematurely into life.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\nAt dawn the next day it was Serge who called Albine. She slept in a room\non the upper floor. He looked up at her window and saw her throw open\nthe shutters just as she had sprung out of bed. They laughed merrily as\ntheir eyes met.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You must not go out to-day,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Albine, when she came down. \u00e2\u0080\u0098We must\nstay indoors and rest. To-morrow I will take you a long, long way off,\nto a spot where we can have a very jolly time.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But sha\u00e2\u0080\u0099n\u00e2\u0080\u0099t we grow tired of stopping here?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 muttered Serge.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh, dear no! I will tell you stories.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThey passed a delightful day. The windows were thrown wide open, and all\nthe beauty of the Paradou came in and rejoiced with them in the room.\nSerge now really took possession of that delightful room, where he\nimagined he had been born. He insisted upon seeing everything, and upon\nhaving everything explained to him. The plaster Cupids who sported\nround the alcove amused him so much that he mounted upon a chair to tie\nAlbine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sash round the neck of the smallest of them, a little bit of a\nman who was turning somersaults with his head downward. Albine clapped\nher hands, and said that he looked like a cockchafer fastened by a\nstring. Then, as though seized by an access of pity, she said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098No, no,\nunfasten him. It prevents him from flying.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut it was the Cupids painted over the doors that more particularly\nattracted Serge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attention. He fidgeted at not being able to make out\nwhat they were playing at, for the paintings had grown very dim. Helped\nby Albine, he dragged a table to the wall, and when they both had\nclimbed upon it, Albine began to explain things to him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Look, now, those are throwing flowers. Under the flowers you can only\nsee some bare legs. It seems to me that when first I came here I could\nmake out a lady reposing there. But she has been gone for a long time\nnow.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThey examined all the panels in turn; but they had faded to such a\ndegree that little more could be distinguished than the knees and elbows\nof infants. The details which had doubtless delighted the eyes of\nthose whose old-time passion seemed to linger round the alcove, had so\ncompletely disappeared under the influence of the fresh air, that the\nroom, like the park, seemed restored to pristine virginity beneath the\nserene glory of the sun.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh! they are only some little boys playing,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Serge, as he\ndescended from the table. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Do you know how to play at \u00e2\u0080\u009chot cockles\u00e2\u0080\u009d?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThere was no game that Albine did not know how to play at. But, for\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098hot cockles,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 at least three players are necessary, and that made them\nlaugh. Serge protested, however, that they got on too well together ever\nto desire a third there, and they vowed that they would always remain by\nthemselves.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098We are quite alone here; one cannot hear a sound,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the young\nman, lolling on the couch. \u00e2\u0080\u0098And all the furniture has such a pleasant\nold-time smell. The place is as snug as a nest. We ought to be very\nhappy in this room.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe girl shook her head gravely.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098If I had been at all timid,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she murmured, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I should have been very\nmuch frightened at first.... That is one of the stories I want to tell\nyou. The people in the neighbourhood told it to me. Perhaps it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\ntrue, but it will amuse us, at any rate.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen she came and sat down by Serge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s side.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is years and years since it all happened. The Paradou belonged to\na rich lord, who came and shut himself up in it with a very beautiful\nlady. The gates of the mansion were kept so tightly closed, and the\ngarden walls were built so very high, that no one ever caught sight even\nof the lady\u00e2\u0080\u0099s skirts.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! I know,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Serge interrupted; \u00e2\u0080\u0098the lady was never seen again.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen, as Albine looked at him in surprise, somewhat annoyed to find that\nhe knew her story already, he added in a low voice, apparently a little\nastonished himself: \u00e2\u0080\u0098You told me the story before, you know.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe declared that she had never done so; but all at once she seemed to\nchange her mind, and allowed herself to be convinced. However, that did\nnot prevent her from finishing her tale in these words: \u00e2\u0080\u0098When the lord\nwent away his hair was quite white. He had all the gates barricaded up,\nso that no one might get inside and disturb the lady. It was in this\nroom that she died.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098In this room!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cried Serge. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You never told me that! Are you quite sure\nthat it was really in this room she died?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAlbine seemed put out. She repeated to him what every one in the\nneighbourhood knew. The lord had built the pavilion for the reception of\nthis unknown lady, who looked like a princess. The servants employed at\nthe mansion afterwards declared that he spent all his days and nights\nthere. Often, too, they saw him in one of the walks, guiding the tiny\nfeet of the mysterious lady towards the densest coppices. But for all\nthe world they would never have ventured to spy upon the pair, who\nsometimes scoured the park for weeks together.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And it was here she died?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 repeated Serge, who felt touched with\nsorrow. \u00e2\u0080\u0098And you have taken her room; you use her furniture, and you\nsleep in her bed.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAlbine smiled.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! well, you know, I am not timid. Besides, it is so long since it all\nhappened. You said what a delightful room it was.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen they both dropped into silence, and glanced, for a moment, towards\nthe alcove, the lofty ceiling, and the corners, steeped in grey gloom.\nThe faded furniture seemed to speak of long past love. A gentle sigh, as\nof resignation, passed through the room.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No, indeed,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 murmured Serge, \u00e2\u0080\u0098one could not feel afraid here. It is too\npeaceful.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut Albine came closer to him and said: \u00e2\u0080\u0098There is something else\nthat only a few people know, and that is that the lord and the lady\ndiscovered in the garden a certain spot where perfect happiness was to\nbe found, and where they afterwards spent all their time. I have been\ntold that by a very good authority. It is a cool, shady spot, hidden\naway in the midst of an impenetrable jungle, and it is so marvellously\nbeautiful that anyone who reaches it forgets all else in the world. The\npoor lady must have been buried there.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Is it anywhere about the parterre?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 asked Serge curiously.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! I cannot tell, I cannot tell,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the young girl with an\nexpression of discouragement. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I know nothing about it. I have searched\neverywhere, but I have never been able to find the least sign of that\nlovely clearing. It is not amongst the roses, nor the lilies, nor the\nviolets.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Perhaps it is hidden somewhere away amongst those mournful-looking\nflowers, where you showed me the figure of a boy standing with his arm\nbroken off.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No, no, indeed.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Perhaps, then, it is in that grotto, near that clear stream, where the\ngreat marble woman, without a face, is lying.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No, no.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAlbine seemed to reflect for a moment. Then, as though speaking to\nherself, she went on: \u00e2\u0080\u0098As soon as ever I came here, I began to hunt for\nit. I spent whole days in the Paradou, and ferreted about in all the\nout-of-the-way green corners, to have the pleasure of sitting for an\nhour in that happy spot. What mornings have I not wasted in groping\nunder the brambles and peeping into the most distant nooks of the park!\nOh! I should have known it at once, that enchanting retreat, with the\nmighty tree that must shelter it with a canopy of foliage, with its\ncarpet of soft silky turf, and its walls of tangled greenery, which the\nvery birds themselves cannot penetrate.\n\nShe raised her voice, and threw one of her arms round Serge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s neck, as\nshe continued: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Tell me, now; shall we search for it together? We shall\nsurely find it. You, who are strong, will push aside the heavy branches,\nwhile I crawl underneath and search the brakes. When I grow weary, you\ncan carry me; you can help me to cross the streams; and if we happen\nto lose ourselves, you can climb the trees and try to discover our way\nagain. Ah! and how delightful it will be for us to sit, side by side,\nbeneath the green canopy in the centre of the clearing! I have been told\nthat in one minute one may there live the whole of life. Tell me, my\ndear Serge, shall we set off to-morrow and scour the park, from bush to\nbush, until we have found what we want?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nSerge shrugged his shoulders, and smiled. \u00e2\u0080\u0098What would be the use?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he\nsaid. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Is it not pleasant in the parterre? Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you think we ought to\nremain among the flowers, instead of seeking a greater happiness that\nlies so far away?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is there that the dead lady lies buried,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 murmured Albine, falling\nback into her reverie. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It was the joy of being there that killed her.\nThe tree casts a shade, whose charm is deathly.... I would willingly die\nso. We would clasp one another there, and we would die, and none would\never find us again.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t talk like that,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 interrupted Serge. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You make me feel so unhappy.\nI would rather that we should live in the bright sunlight, far away from\nthat fatal shade. Your words distress me, as though they urged us to\nsome irreparable misfortune. It must be forbidden to sit beneath a tree\nwhose shade can thus affect one.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Albine gravely declared, \u00e2\u0080\u0098it is forbidden. All the folks of the\ncountryside have told me that it is forbidden.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen silence fell. Serge rose from the couch where he had been lolling,\nand laughed, and pretended that he did not care about stories. The sun\nwas setting, however, before Albine would consent to go into the garden\nfor even a few minutes. She led Serge to the left, along the enclosing\nwall, to a spot strewn with fragments of stone, and woodwork, and\nironwork, bristling too with briars and brambles. It was the site of the\nold mansion, still black with traces of the fire which had destroyed\nthe building. Underneath the briars lay rotting timbers and fire-split\nmasonry. The spot was like a little ravined, hillocky wilderness of\nsterile rocks, draped with rude vegetation, clinging creepers that\ntwined and twisted through every crevice like green serpents. The young\nfolks amused themselves by wandering across this chaos, groping about in\nthe holes, turning over the debris, trying to reconstruct something\nof the past out of the ruins before them. They did not confess their\ncuriosity as they chased one another through the midst of fallen\nfloorings and overturned partitions; but they were indeed, all the time,\nsecretly pondering over the legend of those ruins, and of that lady,\nlovelier than day, whose silken skirt had rustled down those steps,\nwhere now lizards alone were idly crawling.\n\nSerge ended by climbing the highest of the ruinous masses; and, looking\nround at the park which unfolded its vast expanse of greenery, he sought\nthe grey form of the pavilion through the trees. Albine was standing\nsilent by his side, serious once more.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The pavilion is yonder, to the right,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said at last, without\nwaiting for Serge to ask her. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It is the only one of the buildings\nthat is left. You can see it quite plainly at the end of that grove of\nlime-trees.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThey fell into silence again; and then Albine, as though pursuing aloud\nthe reflections which were passing through their minds, exclaimed: \u00e2\u0080\u0098When\nhe went to see her, he must have gone down yonder path, then past those\nbig chestnut trees, and then under the limes. It wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take him a\nquarter of an hour.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nSerge made no reply. But as they went home, they took the path which\nAlbine had pointed out, past the chestnuts and under the limes. It was a\npath that love had consecrated. And as they walked over the grass, they\nseemed to be seeking footmarks, or a fallen knot of ribbon, or a whiff\nof ancient perfume--something that would clearly satisfy them that they\nwere really travelling along the path that led to the joy of union.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Wait out here,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Albine, when they once more stood before the\npavilion; \u00e2\u0080\u0098don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come up for three minutes.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen she ran off merrily, and shut herself up in the room with the blue\nceiling. And when she had let Serge knock at the door twice, she softly\nset it ajar, and received him with an old-fashioned courtesy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Good morrow, my dear lord,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said as she embraced him.\n\nThis amused them extremely. They played at being lovers with childish\nglee. In stammering accents they would have revived the passion which\nhad once throbbed and died there. But it was like a first effort at\nlearning a lesson. They knew not how to kiss each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lips, but\nsought each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cheeks, and ended by dancing around each other,\nwith shrieks of laughter, from ignorance of any other way of showing the\npleasure they experienced from their mutual love.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\nThe next morning Albine was anxious to start at sunrise upon the grand\nexpedition which she had planned the night before. She tapped her feet\ngleefully on the ground, and declared that they would not come back\nbefore nightfall.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Where are you going to take me?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 asked Serge.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You will see, you will see.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut he caught her by the hands and looked her very earnestly in the\nface. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You must not be foolish, you know. I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have you hunting for\nthat glade of yours, or for the tree, or for the grassy couch where one\ndroops and dies. You know that it is forbidden.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe blushed slightly, protesting that she had no such idea in her head.\nThen she added: \u00e2\u0080\u0098But if we should come across them, just by chance, you\nknow, and without really seeking them, you wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind sitting down,\nwould you? Else you must love me very little.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThey set off, going straight through the parterre without stopping to\nwatch the awakening of the flowers which were all dripping after their\ndewy bath. The morning had a rosy hue, the smile of a beautiful child,\njust opening its eyes on its snowy pillow.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Where are you taking me?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 repeated Serge.\n\nBut Albine only laughed and would not answer. Then, on reaching the\nstream which ran through the garden at the end of the flower-beds, she\nhalted in great distress. The water was swollen with the late rains.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098We shall never be able to get across,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she murmured. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I can generally\nmanage it by taking off my shoes and stockings, but, to-day, the water\nwould reach to our waists.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThey walked for a moment or two along the bank to find some fordable\npoint; but the girl said it was hopeless; she knew the stream quite\nwell. Once there had been a bridge across, but it had fallen in, and had\nstrewn the river bed with great blocks of stone, between which the water\nrushed along in foaming eddies.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Get on to my back, then,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Serge.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No, no; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d rather not. If you were to slip, we should both of us get a\nfamous wetting. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how treacherous those stones are.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Get on to my back,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 repeated Serge.\n\nShe was tempted to do so. She stepped back for a spring, and then jumped\nup, like a boy; but she felt that Serge was tottering; and crying out\nthat she was not safely seated, she got down again. However, after two\nmore attempts, she managed to settle herself securely on Serge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s back.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098When you are quite ready,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the young man, laughing, \u00e2\u0080\u0098we will\nstart. Now, hold on tightly. We are off.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAnd, with three light strides, he crossed the stream, scarcely wetting\neven his toes. Midway, however, Albine thought that he was slipping. She\nbroke out into a little scream, and hugged him tightly round his neck.\nBut he sprang forward, and carried her at a gallop over the fine sand on\nthe other side.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Gee up!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she cried, quite calm again, and delighted with this novel\ngame.\n\nHe ran along with her for some distance, she clucking her tongue, and\nguiding him to right or left by some locks of his hair.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Here--here we are,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said at last, tapping him gently on the cheeks.\n\nThen she jumped to the ground; while he, hot and perspiring, leaned\nagainst a tree to draw breath. Albine thereupon began to scold him, and\nthreatened that she would not nurse him if he made himself ill again.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Stuff!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he cried, \u00e2\u0080\u0098it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s done me good. When I have grown quite strong\nagain, I will carry you about all day. But where are you taking me?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Here,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said, as she seated herself beneath a huge pear-tree.\n\nThey were in the old orchard of the park. A hawthorn hedge, a real wall\nof greenery with here and there a gap, separated it from everything\nelse. There was quite a forest of fruit trees, which no pruning knife\nhad touched for a century past. Some of the trees had been strangely\nwarped and twisted by the storms which had raged over them; while\nothers, bossed all over with huge knots and full of deep holes, seemed\nonly to hold on to the soil with their bark. The high branches, bent\neach year by weight of fruit, stretched out like big rackets; and each\ntree helped to keep its fellows erect. The trunks were like twisted\npillars supporting a roof of greenery; and sometimes narrow cloisters,\nsometimes light halls were formed, while now and again the verdure swept\nalmost to the ground and left scarcely room to pass. Round each colossus\na crowd of wild and self-sown saplings had grown up, thicket-like with\nthe entanglement of their young shoots. In the greenish light which\nfiltered like tinted water through the foliage, in the deep silence\nof the mossy soil, one only heard the dull thud of the fruit as it was\nculled by the wind.\n\nAnd there were patriarchal apricot trees that bore their great age\nquite bravely. Though decayed on one side, where they showed a perfect\nscaffolding of dead wood, they were so youthful, so full of life, that,\non the other, young shoots were ever bursting through their rough bark.\nThere were cherry trees, that formed complete towns with houses of\nseveral stories, that threw out staircases and floors of branches, big\nenough for half a score of families. Then there were the apple trees,\nwith their limbs twisted like old cripples, with bark gnarled and\nknotted, and all stained with lichen-growth. There were also smooth pear\ntrees, that shot up mast-like with long slender spars. And there were\nrosy-blossomed peach-trees that won a place amid this teeming growth as\npretty maids do amidst a human crowd by dint of bright smiles and gentle\npersistence. Some had been formerly trained as espaliers, but they had\nbroken down the low walls which had once supported them, and now spread\nabroad in wild confusion, freed from the trammels of trellis work,\nbroken fragments of which still adhered to some of their branches. They\ngrew just as they listed, and resembled well-bred trees, once neat and\nprim, which, having gone astray, now flaunted but vestiges of whilom\nrespectability. And from tree to tree, and from bough to bough, vine\nbranches hung in confusion. They rose like wild laughter, twined for\nan instant round some lofty knot, then started off again with yet more\nsonorous mirth, splotching all the foliage with the merry ebriety of\ntheir tendrils. Their pale sun-gilt green set a glow of bacchanalianism\nabout the weather-worn heads of the old orchard giants.\n\nThen towards the left were trees less thickly planted. Thin-foliaged\nalmonds allowed the sun\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rays to pass and ripen the pumpkins, which\nlooked like moons that had fallen to the earth. Near the edge of a\nstream which flowed through the orchard there also grew various kinds of\nmelons, some rough with knotty warts, some smooth and shining, as oval\nas the eggs of ostriches. At every step, too, progress was barred by\ncurrant bushes, showing limpid bunches of fruit, rubies in one and all\nof which there sparkled liquid sunlight. And hedges of raspberry\ncanes shot up like wild brambles, while the ground was but a carpet\nof strawberry plants, teeming with ripe berries which exhaled a slight\nodour of vanilla.\n\nBut the enchanted corner of the orchard was still further to the left,\nnear a tier of rocks which there began to soar upwards. There you found\nyourself in a veritable land of fire, in a natural hot-house, on which\nthe sun fell freely. At first, you had to make your way through huge,\nungainly fig trees, which stretched out grey branches like arms weary of\nlying still, and whose villose leather-like foliage was so dense that\nin order to pass one constantly had to snap off twigs that had sprouted\nfrom the old wood. Next you passed on through groves of strawberry trees\nwith verdure like that of giant box-plants, and with scarlet berries\nwhich suggested maize plants decked out with crimson ribbon. Then\nthere came a jungle of nettle-trees, medlars and jujube trees, which\npomegranates skirted with never-fading verdure. The fruit of the latter,\nbig as a child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fist, was scarcely set as yet; and the purple blossoms,\nfluttering at the ends of the branches, looked like the palpitating\nwings of the humming birds, which do not even bend the shoots on which\nthey perch. Lastly, there was a forest of orange and lemon trees growing\nvigorously in the open air. Their straight trunks stood like rows of\nbrown columns, while their shiny leaves showed brightly against the\nblue of the sky, and cast upon the ground a network of light and shadow,\nfiguring the palms of some Indian fabric. Here there was shade beside\nwhich that of the European orchard seemed colourless, insipid; the warm\njoy of sunlight, softened into flying gold-dust; the glad certainty\nof evergreen foliage; the penetrating perfume of blossom, and the more\nsubdued fragrance of fruit; all helping to fill the body with the soft\nlanguor of tropical lands.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And now let us breakfast,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cried Albine, clapping her hands. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It must\nbe at least nine o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, and I am very hungry.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe had risen from the ground. Serge confessed that he, too, would find\nsome food acceptable.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You goose!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand, then, that I brought you\nhere to breakfast. We sha\u00e2\u0080\u0099n\u00e2\u0080\u0099t die of hunger here. We can help ourselves\nto all there is.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThey went along under the trees, pushing aside the branches and making\ntheir way to the thickest of the fruit. Albine, who went first, turned,\nand in her flute-like voice asked her companion: \u00e2\u0080\u0098What do you like best?\nPears, apricots, cherries, or currants? I warn you that the pears are\nstill green; but they are very nice all the same.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nSerge decided upon having cherries, and Albine agreed it would be as\nwell to start with them; but when she saw him foolishly beginning to\nscramble up the first cherry tree he found, she made him go on for\nanother ten minutes through a frightful entanglement of branches. The\ncherries on this tree, she said, were small and good for nothing; those\non that were sour; those on another would not be ripe for at least a\nweek. She knew all the trees.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Stop, climb this one,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said at last, as she stopped at the foot of\na tree, so heavily laden with fruit that clusters of it hung down to the\nground, like strings of coral beads.\n\nSerge settled himself comfortably between two branches and began his\nbreakfast. He no longer paid attention to Albine. He imagined she was in\nanother tree, a few yards away, when, happening to cast his eyes towards\nthe ground, he saw her calmly lying on her back beneath him. She had\nthrown herself there, and, without troubling herself to use her hands,\nwas plucking with her teeth the cherries which dangled over her mouth.\n\nWhen she saw she was discovered, she broke out into a peal of laughter,\nand twisted about on the grass like a fish taken from the water. And\nfinally, crawling along on her elbows, she gradually made the circuit of\nthe tree, snapping up the plumpest cherries as she went along.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098They tickle me so,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she cried. \u00e2\u0080\u0098See, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a beauty just fallen on my\nneck. They are so deliciously fresh and juicy. They get into my ears,\nmy eyes, my nose, everywhere. They are much sweeter down here than up\nthere.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Serge, laughing, \u00e2\u0080\u0098you say that because you daren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t climb up.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe remained for a moment silent with indignation. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Daren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t!--I!--\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she\nstammered.\n\nThen, having gathered up her skirts, she tightly grasped the tree and\npulled herself up the trunk with a single effort of her strong wrists.\nAnd afterwards she stepped lightly along the branches, scarcely using\nher hands to steady herself. She had all the agile nimbleness of a\nsquirrel, and made her way onward, maintaining her equilibrium only by\nthe swaying poise of her body. When she was quite aloft at the end of\na frail branch, which shook dangerously beneath her weight, she cried;\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Now you see whether I daren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t climb.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Come down at once,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 implored Serge, full of alarm for her. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I beg of\nyou to come down. You will be injuring yourself.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut she, enjoying her triumph, began to mount still higher. She crawled\nalong to the extreme end of a branch, grasping its leaves in her hands\nto maintain her hold.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The branch will break!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cried Serge, thoroughly frightened.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Let it break,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she answered, with a laugh; \u00e2\u0080\u0098it will save me the trouble\nof getting down.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAnd the branch did break, but only slowly, with such deliberation that,\nas it gradually settled towards the ground, it let Albine slip down in\nvery gentle fashion. She did not appear in the least degree frightened;\nbut gave herself a shake, and said: \u00e2\u0080\u0098That was really nice. It was quite\nlike being in a carriage.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nSerge had jumped down from the tree to catch her in his arms. As he\nstood there, quite pale from fright, she laughed at him. \u00e2\u0080\u0098One tumbles\ndown from trees every day,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u0098but there is never any harm\ndone. Look more cheerful, you great stupid! Stay, just wet your finger\nand rub it upon my neck. I have scratched it.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nSerge wetted his finger and touched her neck with it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There, I am all right again now,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she cried, as she bounded off. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Let\nus play at hide and seek, shall we?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe was the first to hide. She disappeared, and presently from the\ndepths of the greenery, which she alone knew, and where Serge could not\npossibly find her, she called, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Cuckoo, cuckoo.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 But this game of hide\nand seek did not put a stop to the onslaught upon the fruit trees.\nBreakfasting went on in all the nooks and corners where the two big\nchildren sought each other. Albine, while gliding beneath the branches,\nwould stretch out her hand to pluck a green pear or fill her skirt with\napricots. Then in some of her lurking-places she would come upon such\nrich discoveries as would make her careless of the game, content to\nsit upon the ground and remain eating. Once, however, she lost sound of\nSerge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s movements. So, in her turn, she set about seeking him; and she\nwas surprised, almost vexed, when she discovered him under a plum-tree,\nof whose existence she herself had been ignorant, and whose ripe fruit\nhad a delicious musky perfume. She soundly rated him. Did he want to eat\neverything himself, that he hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t called to her to come? He pretended\nto know nothing about the trees, but he evidently had a very keen scent\nto be able to find all the good things. She was especially indignant\nwith the poor tree itself--a stupid tree which no one had known of, and\nwhich must have sprung up in the night on purpose to put people out. As\nshe stood there pouting, refusing to pluck a single plum, it occurred to\nSerge to shake the tree violently. And then a shower, a regular hail, of\nplums came down. Albine, standing in the midst of the downfall, received\nplums on her arms, plums on her neck, plums on the very tip of her nose.\nAt this she could no longer restrain her laughter; she stood in the\nmidst of the deluge, crying \u00e2\u0080\u0098More! more!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 amused as she was by the round\nbullet-like fruit which fell around her as she squatted there, with\nhands and mouth open, and eyes closed.\n\nIt was a morning of childish play, of wild gambols in the Paradou.\nAlbine and Serge spent hours, scampering up and down, shouting and\nsporting with each other, their thoughts still all innocence. And in\nwhat a delicious spot they found themselves! Depths of greenery, with\nundiscoverable hiding-places; paths, along whose windings it was never\npossible to be serious, such greedy laughter fell from the very hedges.\nIn this happy orchard, there was such a playful straggling of bushes,\nsuch fresh and appetising shade, such a wealth of old trees laden like\nkindly grandfathers with sweet dainties. Even in the depths of the\nrecesses green with moss, beneath the broken trunks which compelled them\nto creep the one behind the other, in the narrow leafy alleys, the young\nfolks never succumbed to the perilous reveries of silence. No trouble\ntouched them in that happy wood.\n\nAnd when they had grown weary of the apricot-trees and the plum-trees\nand the cherry-trees, they ran beneath the slender almond-trees; eating\ngreen almonds, scarcely yet as big as peas, hunting for strawberries in\nthe grassy carpet, and regretting that the melons were not already ripe.\nAlbine finished by running as fast as she could go, pursued by Serge,\nwho was unable to overtake her. She rushed amongst the fig-trees,\nleaping over their heavy branches, and pulling off the leaves to throw\nthem behind her in her companion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face. In a few strides she had\ncleared the clumps of arbutus, whose red berries she tasted on her way;\nand it was in the jungle of nettle-trees, medlars, and jujube-trees that\nSerge lost her. At first he thought she was hiding behind a pomegranate;\nbut found that he had mistaken two clustering blossoms for the rosy\nroundness of her wrists. Then he scoured the plantation of orange-trees,\nrejoicing in their beauty and perfume, and thinking that he must have\nreached the abode of the fairies of the sun. In the midst of them he\ncaught sight of Albine, who, not believing him so near her, was peering\ninquisitively into the green depths.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What are you looking for?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he cried. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You know very well that is\nforbidden.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe sprang up hastily, and slightly blushed for the first time that day.\nThen sitting down by the side of Serge, she told him of the fine times\nthere would be when the oranges should be ripe. The wood would then\nbe all golden, all bright with those round stars, dotting with yellow\nsparks the arching green.\n\nWhen at last they really set off homeward she halted at every\nwild-growing fruit tree, and filled her pockets with sour pears and\nbitter plums, saying that they world be good to eat on their way. They\nwould prove a hundred times more enjoyable than anything they had tasted\nbefore. Serge was obliged to swallow some of them, in spite of the\ngrimaces he made at each bite. And eventually they found themselves\nindoors again, tired out but feeling very happy.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\nA week later there was another expedition to the park. They had planned\nto extend their rambles beyond the orchard, striking out to the left\nthrough the meadows watered by the four streams. They would travel\nseveral miles over the thick grass, and they might live on fish, if they\nhappened to lose themselves.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I will take my knife,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Albine, holding up a broad-bladed peasant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nknife.\n\nShe crammed all kinds of things into her pockets, string, bread,\nmatches, a small bottle of wine, some rags, a comb, and some needles.\nSerge took a rug, but by the time they had passed the lime-trees and\nreached the ruins of the chateau, he found it such an encumbrance that\nhe hid it beneath a piece of fallen wall.\n\nThe sun was hotter than before, Albine had delayed their departure by\nher extensive preparations. Thus in the heat of the morning they stepped\nalong side by side, almost quietly. They actually managed to take twenty\npaces at a time without pushing one another or laughing. They began to\ntalk.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I never can wake up,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 began Albine. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I slept so soundly last night. Did\nyou?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes, indeed, very soundly,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied Serge.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What does it mean when you dream of a bird that talks to you?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the girl\nresumed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know. What did your bird say to you?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh, I have forgotten. But it said all kinds of things, and many of\nthem sounded very comical. Stop, look at that big poppy over there. You\nsha\u00e2\u0080\u0099n\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get it, you sha\u00e2\u0080\u0099n\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get it!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAnd then she sprang forward; but Serge, thanks to his long legs,\noutstripped her and plucked the poppy, which he waved about\nvictoriously. She stood there with lips compressed, saying nothing,\nbut feeling a strong inclination to cry. Serge threw down the flower.\nNothing else occurred to him. Then, to make his peace with her, he\nasked: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Would you like me to carry you as I did the other day?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No, no.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe pouted a little, but she had not gone another thirty steps, when she\nturned round smiling. A bramble had caught hold of her dress.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I thought it was you who were treading on my dress purposely. It won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nlet me go. Come and unfasten me.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nWhen she was released, they walked on again, side by side, very quietly.\nAlbine pretended that it was much more amusing to stroll along in this\nfashion, like steady grown-up folks. They had just reached the meadows.\nFar away, in front of them, stretched grassy expanses scarce broken here\nand there by the tender foliage of willows. The grass looked soft and\ndowny, like velvet. It was a deep green, subsiding in the distance into\nlighter tints, and on the horizon assuming a bright yellow glow beneath\nthe flaring sun. The clumps of willows right over yonder seemed like\npure gold, bathed in the tremulous brilliance of the sunshine. Dancing\ndust tipped the blades of grass with quivering light, and as the gentle\nbreezes swept over the free expanse, moire-like reflections appeared on\nthe caressed and quivering herbage. In the nearer fields a multitude of\nlittle white daisies, now in swarms, now straggling, and now in groups,\nlike holiday makers at some public rejoicing, brightly peopled the dark\ngrass. Buttercups showed themselves, gay like little brass bells which\nthe touch of a fly\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wing would set tinkling. Here and there big lonely\npoppies raised fiery cups, and others, gathered together further away,\nspread out like vats purple with lees of wine. Big cornflowers balanced\naloft their light blue caps which looked as if they would fly away\nat every breath of air. Then under foot there were patches of woolly\nfeather-grass and fragrant meadow-sweet, sheets of fescue, dog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s-tail,\ncreeping-bent, and meadow grass. Sainfoin reared its long fine\nfilaments; clover unfurled its clear green leaves, plantains brandished\nforests of spears, lucerne spread out in soft beds of green satin\nbroidered with purple flowers. And all these were seen, to right, to\nleft, in front, everywhere, rolling over the level soil, showing like\nthe mossy surface of a stagnant sea, asleep beneath the sky which ever\nseemed to expand. Here and there, in the vast expanse, the vegetation\nwas of a limpid blue, as though it reflected the colour of the heavens.\n\nAlbine and Serge stepped along over the meadow-lands, with the grass\nreaching to their knees. It was like wading through a pool. Now and\nthen, indeed, they found themselves caught by a current in which a\nstream of bending stalks seemed to flow away between their legs. Then\nthere were placid-looking, slumbering lakes, basins of short grass,\nwhich scarcely reached their ankles. As they walked along together,\ntheir joy found expression not in wild gambols, as in the orchard a week\nbefore, but rather in loitering, with their feet caught among the supple\narms of the herbage, tasting as it were the caresses of a pure stream\nwhich calmed the exuberance of their youth. Albine turned aside and\nslipped into a lofty patch of vegetation which reached to her chin. Only\nher head appeared. For a moment or two she stood there in silence. Then\nshe called to Serge: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Come here, it is just like a bath. It is as if one\nhad green water all over one.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen she gave a jump and scampered off without waiting for him, and\nthey both walked along the margin of the first stream which barred their\nonward course. It was a shallow tranquil brook between banks of wild\ncress. It flowed on so placidly and gently that its surface reflected\nlike a mirror the smallest reed that grew beside it. Albine and Serge\nfollowed this stream, whose onward motion was slower than their own, for\na long time before they came across a tree that flung a long shadow\nupon the idle waters. As far as their eyes could reach they saw the bare\nbrook stretch out and slumber in the sunlight like a blue serpent half\nuncoiled. At last they reached a clump of three willows. Two had their\nroots in the stream; the third was set a little backward. Their trunks,\nrotten and crumbling with age, were crowned with the bright foliage of\nyouth. The shadow they cast was so slight as scarcely to be perceptible\nupon the sunlit bank. Yet here the water, which, both above and below,\nwas so unruffled, showed a transient quiver, a rippling of its surface,\nas though it were surprised to find even this light veil cast over it.\nBetween the three willows the meadow-land sloped down to the stream, and\nsome crimson poppies had sprung up in the crevices of the decaying old\ntrunks. The foliage of the willows looked like a tent of greenery fixed\nupon three stakes by the water\u00e2\u0080\u0099s edge, beside a rolling prairie.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098This is the place,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cried Albine, \u00e2\u0080\u0098this is the place;\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and she glided\nbeneath the willows.\n\nSerge sat down by her side, his feet almost in the water. He glanced\nround him, and murmured: \u00e2\u0080\u0098You know everything, you know all the best\nspots. One might almost think this was an island, ten feet square, right\nin the middle of the sea.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes, indeed, we are quite at home,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she replied, as she gleefully\ndrummed the grass with her fists. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It is altogether our own, and we are\ngoing to do everything ourselves.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Then, as if struck by a brilliant\nidea, she sprang towards him, and, with her face close to his, asked him\njoyously: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Will you be my husband? I will be your wife.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe was delighted at the notion, and replied that he would gladly be\nher husband, laughing even more loudly than she had done herself.\nThen Albine suddenly became grave, and assumed the anxious air of a\nhousewife.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You know,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098that it is I who will have to give the orders. We\nwill have breakfast as soon as you have laid the table.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe gave him her orders in an imperious fashion. He had to stow all the\nvarious articles which she extracted from her pockets into a hole in one\nof the willows, which bole she called the cupboard. The rags\nsupplied the household linen, while the comb represented the toilette\nnecessaries. The needles and string were to be used for mending the\nexplorers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 clothes. Provision for the inner man consisted of the little\nbottle of wine and a few crusts which she had saved from yesterday. She\nhad, to be sure, some matches, by the aid of which she intended to cook\nthe fish they were going to catch.\n\nWhen Serge had finished laying the table, the bottle of wine in the\ncentre, and three crusts grouped round it, he hazarded the observation\nthat the fare seemed to be scanty. But Albine shrugged her shoulders\nwith feminine superiority. And wading into the water, she said in a\nsevere tone, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I will catch the fish; you can watch me.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nFor half an hour she strenuously exerted herself in trying to catch some\nof the little fishes with her hands. She had gathered up her petticoats\nand fastened them together with a piece of string. And she advanced\nquietly into the water, taking the greatest care not to disturb it. When\nshe was quite close to some tiny fish, that lay lurking between a couple\nof pebbles, she thrust down her bare arm, made a wild grasp, and brought\nher hand up again with nothing in it but sand and gravel. Serge then\nbroke out into noisy laughter which brought her back to the bank,\nindignant. She told him that he had no business to laugh at her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he ended by asking, \u00e2\u0080\u0098how are we going to cook your fish when you\nhave caught it? There is no wood about.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThat put the finishing touch to her discouragement. However, the fish\nin that stream didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to be good for much; so she came out of the\nwater and ran through the long grass to get her feet dry.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098See,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she suddenly exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u0098here is some pimpernel. It is very nice.\nNow we shall have a feast.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nSerge was ordered to gather a quantity of the pimpernel and place it on\nthe table. They ate it with their crusts. Albine declared that it was\nmuch better than nuts. She assumed the position of mistress of the\nestablishment, and cut Serge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bread for him, for she would not trust\nhim with the knife. At last she made him store away in the \u00e2\u0080\u0098cupboard\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nthe few drops of wine that remained at the bottom of the bottle. He was\nalso ordered to sweep the grass. Then Albine lay down at full length.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098We are going to sleep now, you know. You must lie down by my side.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe did as he was ordered. They lay there stiffly staring into the air,\nand saying that they were asleep, and that it was very nice. After a\nwhile, however, they drew slightly away from one another, averting their\nheads as if they felt some discomfort. And at last breaking the silence\nwhich had fallen between them, Serge exclaimed: \u00e2\u0080\u0098I love you very much.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nIt was love such as it is without any sensual feeling; that instinctive\nlove which wakens in the bosom of a little man ten years old at the\nsight of some white-robed baby-girl. The meadow-lands, spreading around\nthem all open and free, dissipated the slight fear each felt of the\nother. They knew that they lay there, seen of all the herbage, that the\nblue sky looked down upon them through the light foliage of the willows,\nand the thought was pleasant to them. The willow canopy over their heads\nwas a mere open screen. The shade it cast was so imperceptible that\nit wafted to them none of the languor that some dim coppice might have\ndone. From the far-off horizon came a healthy breeze fraught with all\nthe freshness of the grassy sea, swelling here and there into waves\nof flowers; while, at their feet, the stream, childlike as they were,\nflowed idly along with a gentle babbling that sounded to them like the\nlaughter of a companion. Ah! happy solitude, so tranquil and placid,\nimmensity wherein the little patch of grass serving as their couch took\nthe semblance of an infant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cradle.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enough; said Albine, getting up; \u00e2\u0080\u0098we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve rested long\nenough.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nSerge seemed a little surprised at this speedy termination of their\nsleep. He stretched out his arm and caught hold of Albine, as though to\ndraw her near him again; and when she, laughing, dropped upon her knees\nhe grasped her elbows and gazed up at her. He knew not to what impulse\nhe was yielding. But when she had freed herself, and again had risen to\nher feet, he buried his face amongst the grass where she had lain, and\nwhich still retained the warmth of her body.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said at last, \u00e2\u0080\u0098it is time to get up,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and then he rose from\nthe ground.\n\nThey scoured the meadow-lands until evening began to fall. They went on\nand on, inspecting their garden. Albine walked in front, sniffing like\na young dog, and saying nothing, but she was ever in search of the happy\nglade, although where they found themselves there were none of the big\ntrees of which her thoughts were full. Serge meanwhile indulged in all\nkinds of clumsy gallantry. He rushed forward so hastily to thrust the\ntall herbage aside, that he nearly tripped her up; and he almost tore\nher arm from her body as he tried to assist her over the brooks. Their\njoy was great when they came to the three other streams. The first\nflowed over a bed of pebbles, between two rows of willows, so closely\nplanted that they had to grope between the branches with the risk of\nfalling into some deep part of the water. It only rose to Serge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s knees,\nhowever, and having caught Albine in his arms he carried her to the\nopposite bank, to save her from a wetting. The next stream flowed black\nwith shade beneath a lofty canopy of foliage, passing languidly onward\nwith the gentle rustling and rippling of the satin train of some lady,\ndreamily sauntering through the woodland depths. It was a deep, cold,\nand rather dangerous-looking stream, but a fallen tree that stretched\nfrom bank to bank served them as a bridge. They crossed over, bestriding\nthe tree with dangling feet, at first amusing themselves by stirring the\nwater which looked like a mirror of burnished steel, but then suddenly\nhastening, frightened by the strange eyes which opened in the depths of\nthe sleepy current at the slightest splash. But it was the last stream\nwhich delayed them the most. It was sportive like themselves, it flowed\nmore slowly at certain bends, whence it started off again with merry\nripples, past piles of big stones, into the shelter of some clump of\ntrees, and grew calmer once more. It exhibited every humour as it sped\nalong over soft sand or rocky boulders, over sparkling pebbles or greasy\nclay, where leaping frogs made yellow puddles. Albine and Serge dabbled\nabout in delight, and even walked homewards through the stream in\npreference to remaining on the bank. At every little island that divided\nthe current they landed. They conquered the savage spot or rested\nbeneath the lofty canes and reeds, which seemed to grow there expressly\nas shelter for shipwrecked adventurers. Thus they made a delightful\nprogress, amused by the changing scenery of the banks, enlivened by the\nmerry humour of the living current.\n\nBut when they were about to leave the river, Serge realised that Albine\nwas still seeking something along the banks, on the island, even among\nthe plants that slept on the surface of the water. He was obliged to\ngo and pull her from the midst of a patch of water-lilies whose broad\nleaves set _collerettes_ around her limbs. He said nothing, but shook\nhis finger at her. And at last they went home, walking along, arm in\narm, like young people after a day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s outing. They looked at each other,\nand thought one another handsomer and stronger than before, and of a\ncertainty their laughter had a different ring from that with which it\nhad sounded in the morning.\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Are we never going out again?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 asked Serge some days later.\n\nAnd when he saw Albine shrug her shoulders with a weary air, he added,\nin a teasing kind of way, \u00e2\u0080\u0098You have got tired of looking for your tree,\nthen?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThey joked about the tree all day and made fun of it. It didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exist.\nIt was only a nursery-story. Yet they both spoke of it with a slight\nfeeling of awe. And on the morrow they settled that they would go to\nthe far end of the park and pay a visit to the great forest-trees which\nSerge had not yet seen. Albine refused to take anything along with them.\nThey breakfasted before starting and did not set off till late. The heat\nof the sun, which was then great, brought them a feeling of languor,\nand they sauntered along gently, side by side, seeking every patch of\nsheltering shade. They lingered neither in the garden nor the orchard,\nthrough which they had to pass. When they gained the shady coolness\nbeneath the big trees, they dropped into a still slower pace; and,\nwithout a word, but with a deep sigh, as though it were welcome relief\nto escape from the glare of day, they pushed on into the forest\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ndepths. And when they had nothing but cool green leaves about them, when\nno glimpse of the sunlit expanse was afforded by any gap in the\nfoliage, they looked at each other and smiled, with a feeling of vague\nuneasiness.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098How nice it is here!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 murmured Serge.\n\nAlbine simply nodded her head. A choking sensation in her throat\nprevented her from speaking. Their arms were not passed as usual round\neach other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s waist, but swung loosely by their sides. They walked along\nwithout touching each other, and with their heads inclined towards the\nground.\n\nBut Serge suddenly stopped short on seeing tears trickle down Albine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ncheeks and mingle with the smile that played around her lips.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What is the matter with you?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he exclaimed; \u00e2\u0080\u0098are you in pain? Have you\nhurt yourself?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you see I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m smiling? I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how it is, but the scent of\nall these trees forces tears into my eyes.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 She glanced at him, and then\nresumed: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Why, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re crying too! You see you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help it.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he murmured, \u00e2\u0080\u0098all this deep shade affects one. It seems so\npeaceful, so mournful here that one feels a little sad. But you must\ntell me, you know, if anything makes you really unhappy. I have not done\nanything to annoy you, have I? you are not vexed with me?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe assured him that she was not. She was quite happy, she said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Then why are you not enjoying yourself more? Shall we have a race?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh! no, we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t race,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said, disdainfully, with a pout. And\nwhen he went on to suggest other amusements, such as bird-nesting or\ngathering strawberries or violets, she replied a little impatiently: \u00e2\u0080\u0098We\nare too big for that sort of thing. It is childish to be always playing.\nDoesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it please you better to walk on quietly by my side?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe stepped along so prettily, that it was, indeed, a pleasure to hear\nthe pit-pat of her little boots on the hard soil of the path. Never\nbefore had he paid attention to the rhythmic motion of her figure, the\nsweep of her skirts that followed her with serpentine motion. It was\nhappiness never to be exhausted, to see her thus walking sedately by\nhis side, for he was ever discovering some new charm in the lissom\nsuppleness of her limbs.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You are right,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098this is really the best. I would walk by your\nside to the end of the world, if you wished it.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nA little further on, however, he asked her if she were not tired, and\nhinted that he would not be sorry to have a rest himself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098We might sit down for a few minutes,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he suggested in a stammering\nvoice.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she replied, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But we might lie down, you know, as we did in the meadows the other\nday. We should be quite comfortable.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No, no; I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAnd she suddenly sprang aside, as if scared by the masculine arms\noutstretched towards her. Serge called her a big stupid, and tried to\ncatch her. But at the light touch of his fingers she cried out with such\nan expression of pain that he drew back, trembling.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I have hurt you?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said.\n\nShe did not reply for a moment, surprised, herself, at her cry of fear,\nand already smiling at her own alarm.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No; leave me, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry me;\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and she added in a grave tone, though\nshe tried to feign jocularity: \u00e2\u0080\u0098you know that I have my tree to look\nfor.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen Serge began to laugh, and offered to help her in her search. He\nconducted himself very gently in order that he might not again alarm\nher, for he saw that she was even yet trembling, though she had resumed\nher slow walk beside him. What they were contemplating was forbidden,\nand could bring them no luck; and he, like her, felt a delightful\nawe, which thrilled him at each repeated sigh of the forest trees. The\nperfume of the foliage, the soft green light which filtered through\nthe leaves, the soughing silence of the undergrowth, filled them with\ntremulous excitement, as though the next turn of the path might lead\nthem to some perilous happiness.\n\nAnd for hours they walked on under the cool trees. They retained their\nreserved attitude towards each other, and scarcely exchanged a word,\nthough they never left each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s side, but went together through the\ndarkest greenery of the forest. At first their way lay through a jungle\nof saplings with trunks no thicker than a child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wrist. They had to\npush them aside, and open a path for themselves through the tender\nshoots which threw a wavy lacework of foliage before their eyes. The\nsaplings closed up again behind them, leaving no trace of their passage,\nand they struggled on and on at random, ignorant of where they might be,\nand leaving nothing behind them to mark their progress, save a momentary\nwaving of shaken boughs. Albine, weary of being unable to see more\nthan three steps in front of her, was delighted when they at last\nfound themselves free of this jungle, whose end they had long tried to\ndiscover. They had now reached a little clearing, whence several narrow\npaths, fringed with green hedges, struck out in various directions,\ntwisting hither and thither, intersecting one another, bending and\nstretching in the most capricious fashion. Albine and Serge rose on\ntip-toes to peep over the hedges; but they were in no haste, and would\nwillingly have stayed where they were, lost in the mazy windings,\nwithout ever getting anywhere, if they had not seen before them the\nproud lines of the lofty forest trees. They passed at last beneath their\nshade, solemnly and with a touch of sacred awe, as when one enters some\nvaulted cathedral. The straight lichen-stained trunks of the mighty\ntrees, of a dingy grey, like discoloured stone, towered loftily, line\nby line, like a far-reaching infinity of columns. Naves opened far away,\nwith lower, narrower aisles; naves strangely bold in their proportions,\nwhose supporting pillars were very slender, richly caned, so finely\nchiselled that everywhere they allowed a glimpse of the blue heavens. A\nreligious silence reigned beneath the giant arches, the ground below lay\nhard as stone in its austere nakedness; not a blade of green was there,\nnought but a ruddy dust of dead leaves. And Serge and Albine listened\nto their ringing footsteps as they went on, thrilled by the majestic\nsolitude of this temple.\n\nHere, indeed, if anywhere, must be the much-sought tree, beneath whose\nshade perfect happiness had made its home. They felt that it was nigh,\nsuch was the delight which stole through them amidst the dimness of\nthose mighty arches. The trees seemed to be creatures of kindliness,\nfull of strength and silence and happy restfulness. They looked at\nthem one by one, and they loved them all; and they awaited from their\nmajestic tranquillity some revelation whereby they themselves might\ngrow, expand into the bliss of strong and perfect life. The maples,\nthe ashes, the hornbeams, the cornels, formed a nation of giants, a\nmultitude full of proud gentleness, who lived in peace, knowing that the\nfall of any one of them would have sufficed to wreck a whole corner of\nthe forest. The elms displayed colossal bodies and limbs full of sap,\nscarce veiled by light clusters of little leaves. The birches and the\nalders, delicate as sylphs, swayed their slim figures in the breeze to\nwhich they surrendered the foliage that streamed around them like the\nlocks of goddesses already half metamorphosed into trees. The planes\nshot up regularly with glossy tattooed bark, whence scaly fragments\nfell. Down a gentle slope descended the larches, resembling a band of\nbarbarians, draped in _sayons_ of woven greenery. But the oaks were\nthe monarchs of all--the mighty oaks, whose sturdy trunks thrust out\nconquering arms that barred the sun\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approach from all around them;\nTitan-like trees, oft lightning-struck, thrown back in postures like\nthose of unconquered wrestlers, with scattered limbs that alone gave\nbirth to a whole forest.\n\nCould the tree which Serge and Albine sought be one of those colossal\noaks? or was it one of those lovely planes, or one of those pale,\nmaidenly birches, or one of those creaking elms? Albine and Serge still\nplodded on, unable to tell, completely lost amongst the crowding trees.\nFor a moment they thought they had found the object of their quest in\nthe midst of a group of walnut trees from whose thick foliage fell\nso cold a shadow that they shivered beneath it. Further on they felt\nanother thrill of emotion as they came upon a little wood of chestnut\ntrees, green with moss and thrusting out big strange-shaped branches, on\nwhich one might have built an aerial village. But further still Albine\ncaught sight of a clearing, whither they both ran hastily. Here, in the\nmidst of a carpet of fine turf, a locust tree had set a very toppling of\ngreenery, a foliaged Babel, whose ruins were covered with the strangest\nvegetation. Stones, sucked up from the ground by the mounting sap, still\nremained adhering to the trunk. High branches bent down to earth again,\nand, taking root, surrounded the parent tree with lofty arches, a nation\nof new trunks which ever increased and multiplied. Upon the bark, seared\nwith bleeding wounds, were ripening fruit-pods; the mere effort of\nbearing fruit strained the old monster\u00e2\u0080\u0099s skin until it split. The young\nfolks walked slowly round it, passing under the arched branches which\nformed as it were the streets of a city, and stared at the gaping cracks\nof the naked roots. Then they went off, for they had not felt there the\nsupernatural happiness they sought.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Where are we?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 asked Serge.\n\nAlbine did not know. She had never before come to this part of the park.\nThey were now in a grove of cytisus and acacias, from whose clustering\nblossoms fell a soft, almost sugary perfume. \u00e2\u0080\u0098We are quite lost,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she\nlaughed. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know these trees at all.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But the garden must come to an end somewhere,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Serge. \u00e2\u0080\u0098When we get\nto the end, you will know where you are, won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she answered, waving her hands afar.\n\nThey fell into silence; never yet had the vastness of the park filled\nthem with such pleasure. They joyed at knowing that they were alone in\nso far-spreading a domain that even they themselves could not reach its\nlimits.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, we are lost,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Serge, gaily; then humbly drawing near her he\ninquired: \u00e2\u0080\u0098You are not afraid, are you?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh! no. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no one except you and me in the garden. What could I\nbe afraid of? The walls are very high. We can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see them, but they guard\nus, you know.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nSerge was now quite close to her, and he murmured, \u00e2\u0080\u0098But a little time\nago you were afraid of me.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe looked him straight in the face, perfectly calm, without the least\nfaltering in her glance. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You hurt me,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she replied, \u00e2\u0080\u0098but you are\ndifferent now. Why should I be afraid of you?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Then you will let me hold you like this. We will go back under the\ntrees.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes, you may put your arm around me, it makes me feel happy. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\nwalk slowly, eh? so that we may not find our way again too soon.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe had passed his arm round her waist, and it was thus that they\nsauntered back to the shade of the great forest trees, under whose\narching vaults they slowly went, with love awakening within them.\nAlbine said that she felt a little tired, and rested her head on Serge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nshoulder. The fabulous tree was now forgotten. They only sought to draw\ntheir faces nearer together that they might smile in one another\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes.\nAnd it was the trees, the maples, the elms, the oaks, with their soft\ngreen shade, that whisperingly suggested to them the first words of\nlove.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I love you!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Serge, while his breath stirred the golden hair that\nclustered round Albine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s temples. He tried to think of other words, but\nhe could only repeat, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I love you! I love you!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAlbine listened with a delightful smile upon her face. The music of her\nheart was in accord with his.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I love you! I love you!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she sighed, with all the sweetness of her soft\nyoung voice.\n\nThen, lifting up her blue eyes, in which the light of love was dawning,\nshe asked, \u00e2\u0080\u0098How do you love me?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nSerge reflected for a moment. The forest was wrapped in solemn quietude,\nthe lofty naves quivered only with the soft footsteps of the young pair.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I love you beyond everything,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he answered. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You are more beautiful\nthan all else that I see when I open my window in the morning. When I\nlook at you, I want nothing more. If I could have you only, I should be\nperfectly happy.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe lowered her eyes, and swayed her head as if accompanying a strain of\nmusic. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I love you,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he went on. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I know nothing about you. I know\nnot who you are, nor whence you came. You are neither my mother nor my\nsister; and yet I love you to a point that I have given you my whole\nheart and kept nought of it for others. Listen, I love those cheeks of\nyours, so soft and satiny; I love your mouth with its rose-sweet breath;\nI love your eyes, in which I see my own love reflected; I love even\nyour eyelashes, even those little veins which blue the whiteness of your\ntemples. Ah! yes, I love you, I love you, Albine.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And I love you, too,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she answered. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You are strong, and tall, and\nhandsome. I love you, Serge.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nFor a moment or two they remained silent, enraptured. It seemed to them\nthat soft, flute-like music went before them, that their own words came\nfrom some dulcet orchestra which they could not see. Shorter and shorter\nbecame their steps as they leaned one towards the other, ever threading\ntheir way amidst the mighty trees. Afar off through the long vista\nof the colonnades were glimpses of waning sunlight, showing like a\nprocession of white-robed maidens entering church for a betrothal\nceremony amid the low strains of an organ.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And why do you love me?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 asked Albine again.\n\nHe only smiled, and did not answer her immediately; then he said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I\nlove you because you came to me. That expresses all.... Now we are\ntogether and we love one another. It seems to me that I could not go on\nliving if I did not love you. You are the very breath of my life.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe bent his head, speaking almost as though he were in a dream.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098One does not know all that at first. It grows up in one as one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart\ngrows. One has to grow, one has to get strong.... Do you remember how\nwe loved one another though we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t speak of it? One is childish and\nsilly at first. Then, one fine day, it all becomes clear, and bursts\nout. You see, we have nothing to trouble about; we love one another\nbecause our love and our life are one.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAlbine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head was cast back, her eyes were tightly closed, and she\nscarce drew her breath. Serge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s caressing words enraptured her: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Do you\nreally, really love me?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she murmured, without opening her eyes.\n\nSerge remained silent, sorely troubled that he could find nothing\nfurther to say to prove to her the force of his love. His eyes wandered\nover her rosy face, which lay upon his shoulder with the restfulness of\nsleep. Her eyelids were soft as silk. Her moist lips were curved into a\nbewitching smile, her brow was pure white, with just a rim of gold below\nher hair. He would have liked to give his whole being with the word\nwhich seemed to be upon his tongue but which he could not utter. Again\nhe bent over her, and seemed to consider on what sweet spot of that fair\nface he should whisper the supreme syllables. But he said nothing, he\nonly breathed a little sigh. Then he kissed Albine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lips.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Albine, I love you!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I love you, Serge!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen they stopped short, thrilled, quivering with that first love kiss.\nShe had opened her eyes quite widely. He was standing with his lips\nprotruding slightly towards hers. They looked at each other without a\nblush. They felt they were under the influence of some sovereign power.\nIt was like the realisation of a long dreamt-of meeting, in which they\nbeheld themselves grown, made one for the other, for ever joined. For a\nmoment they remained wondering, raising their eyes to the solemn vault\nof greenery above them, questioning the tranquil nation of trees as if\nseeking an echo of their kiss. But, beneath the serene complacence of\nthe forest, they yielded to prolonged, ringing lovers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 gaiety, full of\nall the tenderness now born.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Tell me how long you have loved me. Tell me everything. Did you love me\nthat day when you lay sleeping upon my hand? Did you love me when I fell\nout of the cherry tree, and you stood beneath it, stretching out your\narms to catch me, and looking so pale? Did you love me when you took\nhold of me round the waist in the meadows to help me over the streams?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Hush, let me speak. I have always loved you. And you, did you love me;\ndid you?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nUntil the evening closed round them they lived upon that one word\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098love,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in which they ever seemed to find some new sweetness. They\nbrought it into every sentence, ejaculated it inconsequentially, merely\nfor the pleasure they found in pronouncing it. Serge, however, did not\nthink of pressing a second kiss to Albine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lips. The perfume of the\nfirst sufficed them in their purity. They had found their way again, or\nrather had stumbled upon it, for they had paid no attention to the paths\nthey took. As they left the forest, twilight had fallen, and the moon\nwas rising, round and yellow, between the black foliage. It was a\ndelightful walk home through the park, with that discreet luminary\npeering at them through the gaps in the big trees. Albine said that\nthe moon was surely following them. The night was balmy, warm too with\nstars. Far away a long murmur rose from the forest trees, and Serge\nlistened, thinking: \u00e2\u0080\u0098They are talking of us.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nWhen they reached the parterre, they passed through an atmosphere of\nsweetest perfumes; the perfume of flowers at night, which is richer,\nmore caressing than by day, and seems like the very breath of slumber.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Good night, Serge.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Good night, Albine.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThey clasped each other by the hand on the landing of the first floor,\nwithout entering the room where they usually wished each other good\nnight. They did not kiss. But Serge, when he was alone, remained seated\non the edge of his bed, listening to Albine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s every movement in the room\nabove. He was weary with happiness, a happiness that benumbed his limbs.\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\nFor the next few days Albine and Serge experienced a feeling of\nembarrassment. They avoided all allusion to their walk beneath\nthe trees. They had not again kissed each other, or repeated their\nconfession of love. It was not any feeling of shame which had sealed\ntheir lips, but rather a fear of in any way spoiling their happiness.\nWhen they were apart, they lived upon the dear recollection of love\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nawakening, plunged into it, passed once more through the happy hours\nwhich they had spent, with their arms around each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s waist, and\ntheir faces close together. It all ended by throwing them both into a\nfeverish state. They looked at each other with heavy eyes, and talked,\nin a melancholy mood, of things that did not interest them in the least.\nThen, after a long interval of silence, Serge would say to Albine in a\ntone full of anxiety: \u00e2\u0080\u0098You are ill?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut she shook her head as she answered, \u00e2\u0080\u0098No, no. It is you who are not\nwell; your hands are burning.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe thought of the park filled them with vague uneasiness which they\ncould not understand. They felt that danger lurked for them in some\nby-path, and would seize them and do them hurt. They never spoke about\nthese disquieting thoughts, but certain timid glances revealed to them\nthe mutual anguish which held them apart as though they were foes. One\nmorning, however, Albine ventured, after much hesitation, to say to\nSerge: \u00e2\u0080\u0098It is wrong of you to keep always indoors. You will fall ill\nagain.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nSerge laughed in rather an embarrassed way. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Bah!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he muttered, \u00e2\u0080\u0098we have\nbeen everywhere, we know all the garden by heart.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut Albine shook her head, and in a whisper replied, \u00e2\u0080\u0098No, no, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nknow the rocks, we have never been to the springs. It was there that I\nwarmed myself last winter. There are some nooks where the stones seem to\nbe actually alive.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe next morning, without having said another word on the subject, they\nset out together. They climbed up to the left behind the grotto where\nthe marble woman lay slumbering; and as they set foot on the lowest\nstones, Serge remarked: \u00e2\u0080\u0098We must see everything. Perhaps we shall feel\nquieter afterwards.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe day was very hot, there was thunder in the air. They had not\nventured to clasp each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s waist; but stepped along, one behind the\nother, glowing beneath the sunlight. Albine took advantage of a widening\nof the path to let Serge go on in front; for the warmth of his breath\nupon her neck troubled her. All around them the rocks arose in broad\ntiers, storeys of huge flags, bristling with coarse vegetation. They\nfirst came upon golden gorse, clumps of sage, thyme, lavender, and other\nbalsamic plants, with sour-berried juniper trees and bitter rosemary,\nwhose strong scent made them dizzy. Here and there the path was hemmed\nin by holly, that grew in quaint forms like cunningly wrought metal\nwork, gratings of blackened bronze, wrought iron, and polished copper,\nelaborately ornamented, covered with prickly _rosaces_. And before\nreaching the springs, they had to pass through a pine-wood. Its shadow\nseemed to weigh upon their shoulders like lead. The dry needles crackled\nbeneath their feet, throwing up a light resinous dust which burned their\nlips.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Your garden doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make itself very agreeable just here,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Serge,\nturning towards Albine.\n\nThey smiled at each other. They were now near the edge of the springs.\nThe sight of the clear waters brought them relief. Yet these springs did\nnot hide beneath a covering of verdure, like those that bubble up on the\nplains and set thick foliage growing around them that they may slumber\nidly in the shade. They shot up in the full light of day from a cavity\nin the rock, without a blade of grass near by to tinge the clear water\nwith green. Steeped in the sunshine they looked silvery. In their depths\nthe sun beat against the sand in a breathing living dust of light. And\nthey darted out of their basin like arms of purest white, they rebounded\nlike nude infants at play, and then suddenly leapt down in a waterfall\nwhose curve suggested a woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s breast.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Dip your hands in,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cried Albine; \u00e2\u0080\u0098the water is icy cold at the\nbottom.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThey were indeed able to refresh their hot hands. They threw water over\ntheir faces too, and lingered there amidst the spray which rose up from\nthe streaming springs.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Look,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cried Albine; \u00e2\u0080\u0098look, there is the garden, and there are the\nmeadows and the forest.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nFor a moment they looked at the Paradou spread out beneath their feet.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And you see,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she added, \u00e2\u0080\u0098there isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the least sign of any wall. The\nwhole country belongs to us, right up to the sky.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBy this time, almost unawares, they had slipped their arms round each\nother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s waist. The coolness of the springs had soothed their feverish\ndisquietude. But just as they were going away, Albine seemed to recall\nsomething and led Serge back again, saying:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Down there, below the rocks, a long time ago, I once saw the wall.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But there is nothing to be seen,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied Serge, turning a little pale.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes, yes; it must be behind that avenue of chestnut trees on the other\nside of those bushes.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen, on feeling Serge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arm tremble, she added: \u00e2\u0080\u0098But perhaps I am\nmistaken.... Yet I seem to remember that I suddenly came upon it as I\nleft the avenue. It stopped my way, and was so high that I felt a little\nafraid. And a few steps farther on, I came upon another surprise. There\nwas a huge hole in it, through which I could see the whole country\noutside.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nSerge looked at her with entreaty in his eyes. She gave a little shrug\nof her shoulders to reassure him, and went on: \u00e2\u0080\u0098But I stopped the hole\nup; I have told you that we are quite alone, and we are. I stopped it up\nat once. I had my knife with me, and I cut down some brambles and\nrolled up some big stones. I would defy even a sparrow to force its way\nthrough. If you like, we will go and look at it one of these days, and\nthen you will be satisfied.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut he shook his head. Then they went away together, still holding each\nother by the waist; but they had grown anxious once more. Serge gazed\ndown askance at Albine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face, and she felt perturbed beneath his\nglance. They would have liked to go down again at once, and thus escape\nthe uneasiness of a longer walk. But, in spite of themselves, as though\nimpelled by some stronger power, they skirted a rocky cliff and reached\na table-land, where once more they found the intoxication of the full\nsunlight. They no longer inhaled the soft languid perfumes of aromatic\nplants, the musky scent of thyme, and the incense of lavender. Now they\nwere treading a foul-smelling growth under foot; wormwood with bitter,\npenetrating smell; rue that reeked like putrid flesh; and hot valerian,\nclammy with aphrodisiacal exudations. Mandragoras, hemlocks, hellebores,\ndwales, poured forth their odours, and made their heads swim till they\nreeled and tottered one against the other.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Shall I hold you up?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Serge asked Albine, as he felt her leaning\nheavily upon him.\n\nHe was already pressing her in his arms, but she struggled out of his\ngrasp, and drew a long breath.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No; you stifle me,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Leave me alone. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what is the\nmatter with me. The ground seems to give way under my feet. It is there\nI feel the pain.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe took hold of his hand and laid it upon her breast. Then Serge turned\nquite pale. He was even more overcome than she. And both had tears in\ntheir eyes as they saw each other thus ill and troubled, unable to think\nof a remedy for the evil which had fallen upon them. Were they going to\ndie here of that mysterious, suffocating faintness?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Come and sit down in the shade,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Serge. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It is these plants which\nare poisoning us with their noxious odours.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe led her gently along by her finger-tips, for she shivered and\ntrembled when he but touched her wrist. It was beneath a fine cedar,\nwhose level roof-like branches spread nearly a dozen yards around, that\nshe seated herself. Behind grew various quaint conifers; cypresses, with\nsoft flat foliage that looked like heavy lace; spruce firs, erect and\nsolemn, like ancient druidical pillars, still black with the blood of\nsacrificed victims; yews, whose dark robes were fringed with silver;\nevergreen trees of all kinds, with thick-set foliage, dark leathery\nverdure, splashed here and there with yellow and red. There was a\nweird-looking araucaria that stood out strangely with large regular\narms resembling reptiles grafted one on the other, and bristling with\nimbricated leaves that suggested the scales of an excited serpent. In\nthis heavy shade, the warm air lulled one to voluptuous drowsiness. The\natmosphere slept, breathless; and a perfume of Eastern love, the perfume\nthat came from the painted lips of the Shunamite, was exhaled by the\nodorous trees.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Are you not going to sit down?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Albine.\n\nAnd she slipped a little aside to make room for him; but Serge stepped\nback and remained standing. Then, as she renewed her request, he dropped\nupon his knees, a little distance away, and said, softly: \u00e2\u0080\u0098No, I am more\nfeverish even than you are; I should make you hot. If I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t afraid of\nhurting you, I would take you in my arms, and clasp you so tightly that\nwe should no longer feel any pain.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe dragged himself nearer to her on his knees.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh! to have you in my arms! In the night I awake from dreams in which\nI see you near me; but, alas! you are ever far away. There seems to be\nsome wall built up between us which I can never beat down. And yet I am\nnow quite strong again; I could catch you up in my arms and swing you\nover my shoulder, and carry you off as though you belonged to me.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe had let himself sink upon his elbows, in an attitude of deep\nadoration. And he breathed a kiss upon the hem of Albine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s skirt. But at\nthis the girl sprang up, as though it was she herself that had received\nthe kiss. She hid her brow with her hands, perturbed, quivering, and\nstammering forth: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t! don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t! I beg of you. Let us go on.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe did not hurry away, but let Serge follow her as she walked slowly\non, stumbling against the roots of the plants, and with her hands still\nclasped round her head, as though to check the excitement that thrilled\nher. When they came out of the little wood, they took a few steps over\nledges of rocks, on which a whole nation of ardent fleshy plants was\nsquatting. It was like a crawling, writhing assemblage of hideous\nnameless monsters such as people a nightmare; monsters akin to spiders,\ncaterpillars, and wood-lice, grown to gigantic proportions, some with\nbare glaucous skins, others tufted with filthy matted hairs, whilst many\nhad sickly limbs--dwarf legs, and shrivelled, palsied arms--sprawling\naround them. And some displayed horrid dropsical bellies; some had\nspines bossy with hideous humps, and others looked like dislocated\nskeletons. Mamillaria threw up living pustules, a crawling swarm of\ngreenish tortoises, bristling hideously with long hairs that were\nstiffer than iron. The echinocacti, which showed more flesh, suggested\nnests of young writhing, knotted vipers. The echinopses were mere\nexcrescent red-haired growths that made one think of huge insects rolled\ninto balls. The prickly-pears spread out fleshy leaves spotted with\nruddy spikes that resembled swarms of microscopic bees. The gasterias\nsprawled about like big shepherd-spiders turned over on their backs,\nwith long-speckled and striated legs. The cacti of the cereus family\nshowed a horrid vegetation, huge polyps, the diseases of an overheated\nsoil, the maladies of poisoned sap. But the aloes, languidly unfolding\ntheir hearts, were particularly numerous and conspicuous. Among them\none found every possible tint of green, pale green and vivid, yellowish\ngreen and greyish, browny green, dashed with a ruddy tone, and deep\ngreen, fringed with pale gold. And the shapes of their leaves were as\nvaried as their tints. Some were broad and heart-shaped, others were\nlong and narrow like sword-blades; some bristled with spikey thorns,\nwhile yet others looked as though they had been cunningly hemmed at the\nedges. There were giant ones, in lonely majesty, with flower stalks that\ntowered up aloft like poles wreathed with rosy coral; and there were\ntiny ones clustering thickly together on one and the same stem, and\nthrowing forth on all sides leaves that gleamed and quivered like\nadders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 tongues.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Let us go back to the shade,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 begged Serge. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You can sit down there as\nyou did just now, and I will lie at your feet and talk to you.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nWhere they stood the sun rays fell like torrential rain. It was as if\nthe triumphant orb seized upon the shadowless ground, and strained it\nto his blazing breast. Albine grew faint, staggered, and turned to Serge\nfor support.\n\nBut the moment they felt each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s touch, they fell together without\neven a word. It was as though the very rock beneath them had opened, as\nthough they were ever going down and down. Their hands sought each other\ncaressingly, embracingly, but such keen anguish did they experience\nthat they suddenly tore themselves apart, and fled, each in a different\ndirection. Serge did not cease running till he had reached the pavilion,\nand had thrown himself upon his bed, his brain on fire, and despair in\nhis heart. Albine did not return till nightfall, after hours of weeping\nin a corner of the garden. It was the first time that they had not\nreturned home together, tired after their long wanderings. For three\ndays they kept apart, feeling terribly unhappy.\n\n\n\n\nXIII\n\nYet now the park was entirely their own. They had taken sovereign\npossession of it. There was not a corner of it that was not theirs to\nuse as they willed. For them alone the thickets of roses put forth their\nblossoms, and the parterre exhaled its soft perfume, which lulled them\nto sleep as they lay at night with their windows open. The orchard\nprovided them with food, filling Albine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s skirts with fruits, and\nspread over them the shade of its perfumed boughs, under which it was\nso pleasant to breakfast in the early morning. Away in the meadows the\ngrass and the streams were all theirs; the grass, which extended their\nkingdom to such boundless distance, spreading an endless silky carpet\nbefore them; and the streams, which were the best of their joys,\nemblematic of their own purity and innocence, ever offering them\ncoolness and freshness in which they delighted to bathe their youth. The\nforest, too, was entirely theirs, from the mighty oaks, which ten men\ncould not have spanned, to the slim birches which a child might have\nsnapped; the forest, with all its trees, all its shade, all its avenues\nand clearings, its cavities of greenery, of which the very birds\nthemselves were ignorant; the forest which they used as they listed,\nas if it were a giant canopy, beneath which they might shelter from the\nnoontide heat their new-born love. They reigned everywhere, even among\nthe rocks and the springs, even over that gruesome stretch of ground\nthat teemed with such hideous growth, and which had seemed to sink and\ngive way beneath their feet, but which they loved yet even more than\nthe soft grassy couches of the garden, for the strange thrill of passion\nthey had felt there.\n\nThus, now, in front of them, behind them, to the right of them and\nto the left, all was theirs. They had gained possession of the whole\ndomain, and they walked through a friendly expanse which knew them, and\nsmiled kindly greetings to them as they passed, devoting itself to their\npleasure, like a faithful and submissive servitor. The sky, with its\nvast canopy of blue overhead, was also theirs to enjoy. The park walls\ncould not enclose it, their eyes could ever revel in its beauty, and it\nentered into the joy of their life, at daytime with its triumphal sun,\nat night with its golden rain of stars. At every moment of the day it\ndelighted them afresh, its expression ever varying. In the early morning\nit was pale as a maiden just risen from her slumber; at noon, it was\nflushed, radiant as with a longing for fruitfulness, and in the\nevening it became languid and breathless, as after keen enjoyment. Its\ncountenance was constantly changing. Particularly in the evenings, at\nthe hour of parting, did it delight them. The sun, hastening towards the\nhorizon, ever found a fresh smile. Sometimes he disappeared in the\nmidst of serene calmness, unflecked by a single cloud, sinking gradually\nbeneath a golden sea. At other times he threw out crimson glories, tore\nhis vaporous robe to shreds, and set amidst wavy flames that streaked\nthe skies like the tails of gigantic comets, whose radiant heads lit up\nthe crests of the forest trees. Then, again, extinguishing his rays\none by one, he would softly sink to rest on shores of ruddy sand,\nfar-reaching banks of blushing coral; and then, some other night, he\nwould glide away demurely behind a heavy cloud that figured the grey\nhangings of some alcove, through which the eye could only detect a spark\nlike that of a night-light. Or else he would rush to his couch in\na tumult of passion, rolled round with white forms which gradually\ncrimsoned beneath his fiery embraces, and finally disappeared with him\nbelow the horizon in a confused chaos of gleaming, struggling limbs.\n\nIt was only the plants which had not made their submission. Albine and\nSerge passed like monarchs through the kingdom of animals, who rendered\nthem humble and loyal obeisance. When they crossed the parterre, flights\nof butterflies arose to delight their eyes, to fan them with quivering\nwings, and to follow in their train like living sunbeams or flying\nblossoms. In the orchard, they were greeted by the birds that banqueted\nin the fruit-trees. The sparrows, the chaffinches, the golden orioles,\nthe bullfinches, showed them the ripest fruit scarred by their hungry\nbeaks; and while they sat astride the branches and breakfasted, birds\ntwittered and sported round them like children at play, and even\npurloined the fruit beneath their very feet. Albine found even more\namusement in the meadows, where she caught the little green frogs\nwith eyes of gold, that lay squatting amongst the reeds, absorbed in\ncontemplation; while Serge, with a piece of straw, poked the crickets\nout of their hiding-places, or tickled the grasshoppers to make them\nsing. He picked up insects of all colours, blue ones, red ones, yellow\nones, and set them creeping upon his sleeve, where they gleamed and\nglittered like buttons of sapphire and ruby and topaz.\n\nThen there was all the mysterious life of the streams; the grey-backed\nfishes that threaded the dim waters, the eels whose presence was\nbetrayed by a slight quivering of the water-plants, the young fry, which\ndispersed like blackish sand at the slightest sound, the long-legged\nflies and the water-beetles that ruffled into circling silvery ripples\nthe stagnant surface of the pools; all that silent teeming life which\ndrew them to the water and impelled them to dabble and stand in it, so\nthat they might feel those millions of existences ever and ever gliding\npast their limbs. At other times, when the day was hot and languid, they\nwould betake themselves beneath the voiceful shade of the forest and\nlisten to the serenades of their musicians, the clear fluting of the\nnightingales, the silvery bugle-notes of the tomtits, and the far-off\naccompaniment of the cuckoos. They gazed with delight upon the swift\nflight of the pheasants, whose plumes gleamed like sudden sun rays\namidst the branches, and with a smile they stayed their steps to let a\ntroop of young roebucks bound past, or else a couple of grave stags that\nslackened their pace to look at them. Again, on other days they would\nclimb up amongst the rocks, when the sun was blazing in the heavens,\nand find a pleasure in watching the swarms of grasshoppers which at the\nsound of their footsteps arose with a great crepitation of wings from\nthe beds of thyme. The snakes that lay uncoiled beneath the parched\nbushes, or the lizards that sprawled over the red-hot stones, watched\nthem with friendly eyes.\n\nOf all the life that thus teemed round them in the park, Albine and\nSerge had only become really conscious since the day when a kiss had\nawakened them to life themselves. Now it deafened them at times, and\nspoke to them in a language which they did not understand. It was that\nlife--all the voices of the animal creation, all the perfumes and soft\nshadows of the flowers and trees--which perturbed them to such a point\nas to make them angry with one another. And yet throughout the whole\npark they found nothing but loving familiarity. Every plant and every\ncreature was their friend. All the Paradou was one great caress.\n\nBefore they had come thither, the sun had for a whole century reigned\nover it in lonely majesty. The garden, then, had known no other master;\nit had beheld him, every morning, scaling the boundary wall with his\nslanting rays, at noontide it had seen him pour his vertical heat upon\nthe panting soil; and at evening it had seen him go off, on the other\nside, with a kiss of farewell upon its foliage. And so the garden had\nno shyness; it welcomed Albine and Serge, as it had so long welcomed\nthe sun, as pleasant companions, with whom one puts on no ceremony.\nThe animals, the trees, the streams, the rocks, all continued in an\nunrestrained state of nature, speaking aloud, living openly, without a\nsecret, displaying the innocent shamelessness, the hearty tenderness of\nthe world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first days. Serge and Albine, however, suffered from these\nvoluptuous surroundings, and at times felt minded to curse the garden.\nOn the afternoon when Albine had wept so bitterly after their saunter\namongst the rocks, she had called out to the Paradou, whose intensity of\nlife and passion filled her with distress:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098If you really be our friend, why, why do you make us so wretched?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\n\n\nXIV\n\nThe next morning Serge barricaded himself in his room. The perfume from\nthe garden irritated him. He drew the calico curtains closely across the\nwindow to shut out the sight of the park. Perhaps he thought he might\nrecover all his old serenity and calm if he shut himself off from that\ngreenery, whose shade sent such passionate thrills quivering through\nhim.\n\nDuring the long hours they spent together, Albine and he never now spoke\nof the rocks or the streams, the trees or the sky. The Paradou might no\nlonger have been in existence. They strove to forget it. And yet they\nwere all the time conscious of its presence on the other side of\nthose slight curtains. Scented breezes forced their way in through the\ninterstices of the window frame, the many voices of nature made\nthe panes resound. All the life of the park laughed, chattered, and\nwhispered in ambush beneath their window. As it reached them their\ncheeks would pale and they would raise their voices, seeking some\noccupation which might prevent them from hearing it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Have you noticed,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Serge one morning during these uneasy\nintervals, \u00e2\u0080\u0098there is a painting of a woman over the door there? She is\nlike you.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe laughed noisily as he finished speaking. They both turned to the\npaintings and dragged the table once more alongside the wall, with a\nnervous desire to occupy themselves.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh! no,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 murmured Albine. \u00e2\u0080\u0098She is much fatter than I am. But one can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nsee her very well; her position is so queer.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThey relapsed into silence. From the decayed, faded painting a scene,\nwhich they had never before noticed, now showed forth. It was as if the\npicture had taken shape and substance again beneath the influence of\nthe summer heat. You could sea a nymph with arms thrown back and pliant\nfigure on a bed of flowers which had been strewn for her by young\ncupids, who, sickle in hand, ever added fresh blossoms to her rosy\ncouch. And nearer, you could also see a cloven-hoofed faun who had\nsurprised her thus. But Albine repeated, \u00e2\u0080\u0098No, she is not like me, she is\nvery plain.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nSerge said nothing. He looked at the girl and then at Albine, as though\nhe were comparing them one with the other. Albine pulled up one of her\nsleeves, as if to show that her arm was whiter than that of the pictured\ngirl. Then they subsided into silence again, and gazed at the painting;\nand for a moment Albine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s large blue eyes turned to Serge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grey ones,\nwhich were glowing.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You have got all the room painted again, then?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she cried, as she\nsprang from the table. \u00e2\u0080\u0098These people look as though they were all coming\nto life again.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThey began to laugh, but there was a nervous ring about their merriment\nas they glanced at the nude and frisking cupids which started to\nlife again on all the panels. They no longer took those survivals of\nvoluptuous eighteenth century art to represent mere children at play.\nThey were disturbed by the sight of them, and as Albine felt Serge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hot\nbreath on her neck she started and left his side to seat herself on the\nsofa. \u00e2\u0080\u0098They frighten me,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she murmured. \u00e2\u0080\u0098The men are like robbers,\nand the women, with their dying eyes, look like people who are being\nmurdered.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nSerge sat down in a chair, a little distance away, and began to talk of\nother matters. But they remained uneasy. They seemed to think that all\nthose painted figures were gazing at them. It was as if the trooping\ncupids were springing out of the panelling, casting the flowers they\nheld around them, and threatening to bind them together with the blue\nribbons which already enchained two lovers in one corner of the ceiling.\nAnd the whole story of the nymph and her faun lover, from his first peep\nat her to his triumph among the flowers, seemed to burst into warm life.\nWere all those lovers, all those impudent shameless cupids about to step\ndown from their panels and crowd around them? They already seemed to\nhear their panting sighs, and to feel their breath filling the spacious\nroom with the perfume of voluptuousness.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quite suffocating, isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sighed Albine. \u00e2\u0080\u0098In spite of every\nairing I have given it, the room has always seemed close to me!\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The other night,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Serge, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I was awakened by such a penetrating\nperfume, that I called out to you, thinking you had come into the room.\nIt was just like the soft warmth of your hair when you have decked it\nwith heliotropes.... In the earlier times it seemed to be wafted to me\nfrom a distance, it was like the lingering memory of a perfume; but now\nI can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sleep for it, and it is so strong and penetrating that it quite\nstupefies me. The alcove grows so hot, too, at night that I shall be\nobliged to lie on the couch.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAlbine laid her fingers on her lips, and whispered, \u00e2\u0080\u0098It is the dead\ngirl--she who once lived here.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThey sniffed the odorous air with forced gaiety, but in reality feeling\nvery troubled. Certainly never before had the room exhaled such a\ndisquieting aroma. The very walls seemed to be still echoing the faint\nrustling of perfumed skirts; and the floor had retained the fragrance\nof satin slippers dropped by the bedside, and near the head of the bed\nitself Serge thought he could trace the imprint of a little hand, which\nhad left behind it a clinging scent of violets. Over all the furniture\nthe phantom presence of the dead girl still lingered fragrantly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098See, this is the armchair where she used to sit,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cried Albine; \u00e2\u0080\u0098there\nis the scent of her shoulders at the back of it yet.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe sat down in it herself, and bade Serge drop upon his knees and kiss\nher hand.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You remember the day when I first let you in and said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood morrow,\nmy dear lord!\u00e2\u0080\u009d But that wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t all, was it? He kissed her hands when the\ndoor was closed. There they are, my hands. They are yours.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen they tried to resume their old frolics in order that they might\nforget the Paradou, whose joyous murmur they heard ever rising outside,\nand that they might no longer think of the pictures nor yield to the\nlanguor-breathing influence of the room. Albine put on an affected\nmanner, leant back in her chair, and finally laughed at the foolish\nfigure which Serge made at her feet.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You stupid!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098take me round the waist, and say pretty things\nto me, since you are supposed to be in love with me. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you know how\nto make love then?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut as soon as she felt him clasp her with eager impetuosity, she began\nto struggle, and freed herself from his embrace.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No, no; leave me alone. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bear it. I feel as though I were\nchoking in this room.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nFrom that day forward they felt the same kind of fear for the room as\nthey already felt for the garden. Their one remaining harbour of refuge\nwas now a place to be shunned and dreaded, a spot where they could no\nlonger find themselves together without watching each other furtively.\nAlbine now scarcely ventured to enter it, but remained near the\nthreshold, with the door wide open behind her so as to afford her an\nimmediate retreat. Serge lived there in solitude, a prey to sickening\nrestlessness, half-stifling, lying on the couch and vainly trying to\nclose his ears to the sighs of the soughing park and his nostrils to\nthe haunting fragrance of the old furniture. At night he dreamt wild\npassionate dreams, which left him in the morning nervous and disquieted.\nHe believed that he was falling ill again, that he would never recover\nplenitude of health. For days and days he remained there in silence,\nwith dark rings round his sleepy eyes, only starting into wakefulness\nwhen Albine came to visit him. They would remain face to face, gazing\nat one another sadly, and uttering but a few soft words, which seemed to\nchoke them. Albine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes were even darker than Serge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, and were filled\nwith an imploring gaze.\n\nThen, after a week had gone by, Albine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s visit never lasted more than\na few minutes. She seemed to shun him. When she came to the room, she\nappeared thoughtful, remained standing, and hurried off as soon as\npossible. When he questioned her about this change in her demeanour\ntowards him, and reproached her for no longer being friendly, she turned\nher head away and avoided replying. He never could get her to tell him\nhow she spent the mornings that she passed alone. She would only\nshake her head, and talk about being very idle. If he pressed her\nmore closely, she bounded out of the room, just wishing him a hasty\ngood-night as she disappeared through the doorway. He often noticed,\nhowever, that she had been crying. He observed, too, in her expression\nthe phases of a hope that was never fulfilled, the perpetual struggling\nof a desire eager to be satisfied. Sometimes she seemed quite\noverwhelmed with melancholy, dragging herself about with an air of utter\ndiscouragement, like one who no longer had any pleasure in living. At\nother times she laughed lightly, her face shone with an expression of\ntriumphant hope, of which, however, she would not yet speak, and her\nfeet could not remain still, so eager was she to dart away to what\nseemed to her some last certainty. But on the following day, she would\nsink again into desperation, to soar afresh on the morrow on the pinions\nof renewed hope. One thing which she could not conceal from Serge was\nthat she suffered from extreme lassitude. Even during the few moments\nthey spent together she could not prevent her head from nodding, or keep\nherself from dozing off.\n\nSerge, recognising that she was unwilling to reply, had ceased to\nquestion her; and, when she now entered his room, he contented himself\nwith casting an anxious glance at her, fearful lest some evening she\nshould no longer have strength enough to come to him. Where could she\nthus reduce herself to such exhaustion? What perpetual struggle was it\nthat brought about those alternations of joy and despair? One morning\nhe started at the sound of a light footfall beneath his window. It\ncould not be a roe venturing abroad in that manner. Moreover he could\nrecognise that light footfall. Albine was wandering about the Paradou\nwithout him. It was from the Paradou that she returned to him with all\nthose hopes and fears and inward wrestlings, all that lassitude which\nwas killing her. And he could well guess what she was seeking out there,\nalone in the woody depths, with all the silent obstinacy of a woman who\nhas vowed to effect her purpose. After that he used to listen for her\nsteps. He dared not draw aside the curtain and watch her as she hurried\nalong through the trees; but he experienced strange, almost painful\nemotion, in listening to ascertain what direction she took, whether she\nturned to right or to left, whether she went straight on through the\nflower-beds, and how far her ramble extended. Amidst all the noisy life\nof the Paradou, amidst the soughing chorus of the trees, the rustling of\nthe streams, and the ceaseless songs of the birds, he could distinguish\nthe gentle pit-pat of her shoes so plainly that he could have told\nwhether she was stepping over the gravel near the rivers, the crumbling\nmould of the forest, or the bare ledges of the rocks. In time he even\nlearned to tell, from the sound of her nervous footfall, whether she\ncame back hopeful or depressed. As soon as he heard her step on the\nstaircase, he hurried from the window, and he never let her know that\nhe had thus followed her from afar in her wanderings. But she must have\nguessed it, for with a glance she always afterwards told him where she\nhad been.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Stay indoors, and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go out,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he begged her, with clasped hands,\none morning when he saw her still unrecovered from the fatigue of the\nprevious day. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You drive me to despair.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut she hastened away in irritation. The garden, now that it rang with\nAlbine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s footfalls, seemed to have a more depressing influence than ever\nupon Serge. The pit-pat of her feet was yet another voice that called\nhim; an imperious voice that echoed ever more and more loudly within\nhim. He closed his ears and tried to shut out the sound, but the distant\nfootsteps still echoed to him in the throbbings of his heart. And when\nshe came back, in the evening, it was the whole park that came back with\nher, with the memories of their walks together, and of the slow dawn of\ntheir love, in the midst of conniving nature. She seemed to have grown\ntaller and graver, mellowed, matured by her solitary rambles. There\nwas nothing left in her of the frolicsome child, and his teeth would\nsuddenly set at times when he looked at her and beheld her so desirable.\n\nOne day, about noon, Serge heard Albine returning in hot haste. He had\nrestrained himself from listening for her steps when she went away.\nUsually, she did not return till late, and he was amazed at her\nimpetuosity as she sped along, forcing her way through the branches that\nbarred her path. As she passed beneath his window, he heard her laugh;\nand as she mounted the stairway, she panted so heavily that he almost\nthought he could feel her hot breath streaming against his face. She\nthrew the door wide open, and cried out: \u00e2\u0080\u0098I have found it!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen she sat down and repeated softly, breathlessly: \u00e2\u0080\u0098I have found it! I\nhave found it!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nSerge, distracted, laid his fingers on her lips, and stammered: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\ntell me anything, I beg you. I want to know nothing of it. It will kill\nme, if you speak.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen she sank into silence with gleaming eyes and lips tightly pressed\nlest the words she kept back should spring out in spite of her. And\nshe stayed in the room till evening, trying to meet Serge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s glance, and\nimparting to him, each time that their eyes met, something of that which\nshe had discovered. Her whole face beamed with radiance, she exhaled a\ndelicious odour, she was full of life; and Serge felt that she permeated\nhim through all his senses. Despairingly did he struggle against this\ngradual invasion of his being.\n\nOn the morrow she returned to his room as soon as she was up.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you going out?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he asked, conscious that he would be vanquished\nshould she remain there.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said; she wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going out any more. As by degrees she\nrecovered from her fatigue he felt her becoming stronger, more\ntriumphant. She would soon be able to take him by the hand and drag him\nto that spot, whose charm her silence proclaimed so loudly. That day,\nhowever, she did not speak; she contented herself with keeping him\nseated on a cushion at her feet. It was not till the next morning\nthat she ventured to say: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Why do you shut yourself up here? It is so\npleasant under the trees.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe rose from her feet, and stretched out his arms entreatingly. But she\nlaughed at him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, well, then, we won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go out, since you would rather not....\nBut this room has such a strange scent, and we should be much more\ncomfortable in the garden. It is very wrong of you to have taken such a\ndislike to it.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe had again settled himself at her feet in silence, his eyelids\nlowered, his features quivering with passionate emotion.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098We won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go out,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she repeated, \u00e2\u0080\u0098so don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry. But do you really\nprefer these pictures to the grass and flowers in the park? Do you\nremember all we saw together? It is these paintings which make us feel\nso unhappy. They are a nuisance, always looking and watching us as they\ndo.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAs Serge gradually leant more closely against her, she passed her arm\nround his neck and laid his head upon her lap, while murmuring in yet a\nlower tone: \u00e2\u0080\u0098There is a little corner there I know, where we might be\nso very happy. Nothing would trouble us there; the fresh air would cool\nyour feverishness.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen she stopped, as she felt him quivering. She was afraid lest she\nmight again revive his old fears. But she gradually conquered him merely\nby the caressing gaze of her blue eyes. His eyelids were now raised, and\nhe rested there quietly, wholly hers, his tremor past.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! if you only knew!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she softly breathed; and seeing that he\ncontinued to smile, she went on boldly: \u00e2\u0080\u0098It is all a lie; it is not\nforbidden. You are a man now and ought not to be afraid. If we went\nthere, and any danger threatened me, you would protect me, you would\ndefend me, would you not? You could carry me off on your back, couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nyou? I am never the least afraid when I have you with me. Look how\nstrong your arms have grown. What is there for any one with such strong\narms as yours to be afraid of?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe caressed him beguilingly as she spoke, stroking his hair and neck\nand shoulders with her hand.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No, it is not forbidden,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she resumed. \u00e2\u0080\u0098That is only a story for\nstupids, and was invented, long ago, by some one who didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to be\ndisturbed in the most charming spot in the whole garden. As soon as\nyou sat down on that grassy carpet, you would be happy and well again.\nListen, then, come with me.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe shook his head but without any sign of vexation, as though indeed he\nliked thus being teased. Then after a short silence, grieved to see her\npouting, and longing for a renewal of her caresses, he opened his lips\nand asked: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Where is it?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe did not answer him immediately. Her eyes seemed to be wandering far\naway: \u00e2\u0080\u0098It is over yonder,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she murmured at last. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I cannot explain to\nyou clearly. One has to go down the long avenue, and then to turn to\nthe left, and then again to the left. We must have passed it at least a\nscore of times. You might look for it for ever without finding it, if\nI didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go with you to show you. I could find my way to it quite\nstraight, though I could never explain it to you.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And who took you there?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know. That morning the trees and plants seemed to drive me\nthere. The long branches pushed me on, the grass bent down before me\ninvitingly, the paths seemed to open expressly for me to take them. And\nI believe the animals themselves helped to lead me there, for I saw a\nstag trotting on before me as though he wanted me to follow; while a\ncompany of bullfinches flitted on from tree to tree, and warned me with\ntheir cries whenever I was about to take a wrong direction.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And is it very beautiful?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAgain she did not reply. Deep ecstasy filled her eyes; at last, when she\nwas able to speak again, she said: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! so beautiful, that I could\nnever tell you of it. I was so charmed that I was conscious only of\nsome supreme joy, which I could not name, falling from the leaves and\nslumbering amid the grass. And I ran back here to take you along with me\nthat I might not be without you.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen she clasped her arms round his neck again, and entreated him\npassionately, her lips almost pressed to his own.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh! you will come!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she stammered; \u00e2\u0080\u0098you must come; you will make me so\nmiserable if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want me to be miserable.... And even\nif you knew that you would die there, even if that shade should be fatal\nto both of us, would you hesitate or cast a regretful look behind? We\nshould remain there, at the foot of the tree, and sleep on quietly for\never, in one anther\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arms. Ah! would it not be bliss indeed?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes, yes!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he stammered, transported by her passionate entreaties.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But we shall not die,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she continued, raising her voice, and laughing\nwith the laugh which proclaims woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s victory; \u00e2\u0080\u0098we shall live to love\neach other. It is a tree of life, a tree whose shadow will make us\nstronger, more perfect, more complete. You will see that all will now go\nhappily. Some blessed joy will assuredly descend on us from heaven! Will\nyou come?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHis face paled, and his eyelids quivered, as though too powerful a light\nwere suddenly beating against them.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Will you come? will you come?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she cried again, yet more passionately,\nand already half rising to her feet.\n\nHe sprang up and followed her, at first with tottering steps and then\nwith his arm thrown round her waist, as if he could endure no separation\nfrom her. He went where she went, carried along in the warm fragrance\nthat streamed from her hair. And as he thus remained slightly in the\nrear, she turned upon him a face so radiant with love, such tempting\nlips and eyes, which so imperiously bade him follow, that he would have\ngone with her anywhere, trusting and unquestioning, like a dog.\n\n\n\n\nXV\n\nThey went down and out into the garden without the smile fading from\nSerge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face. All that he saw of the greenery around him was such as was\nreflected in the clear depths of Albine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes. As they approached, the\ngarden smiled and smiled again, a murmur of content sped from leaf to\nleaf and from bough to bough to the furthest depths of the avenues. For\ndays and days the garden must have been hoping and expecting to see them\nthus, clinging to one another, making their peace again with the trees\nand searching for their lost love on the grassy banks. A solemn warning\nbreath sighed through the branches; the afternoon sky was drowsy with\nheat; the plants raised their bowing heads to watch them pass.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Listen,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 whispered Albine. \u00e2\u0080\u0098They drop into silence as we come near\nthem; but over yonder they are expecting us, they are telling each other\nthe way they must lead us.... I told you we should have no trouble about\nthe paths, the trees themselves will direct us with their spreading\narms.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe whole park did, indeed, appear to be impelling them gently onward.\nIn their rear it seemed as if a barrier of brush-wood had bristled up\nto prevent them from retracing their steps; while, in front of them, the\ngrassy lawns spread out so invitingly, that they glided along the soft\nslopes, without thought of choosing their way.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And the birds are coming with us, too,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Albine. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It is the tomtits\nthis time. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you see them? They are skimming over the hedges, and\nthey stop at each turning to see that we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t lose our way.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Then she\nadded: \u00e2\u0080\u0098All the living things of the park are with us. Can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you hear\nthem? There is a deep rustling close behind us. It is the birds in\nthe trees, the insects in the grass, the roebucks and the stags in the\ncoppices, and even the little fishes splashing the quiet water with\ntheir beating fins. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t turn round, or you will frighten them. Ah! I\nam sure we have a rare train behind us.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThey still walked on, unfatigued. Albine spoke only to charm Serge with\nthe music of her voice, while Serge obeyed the slightest pressure of her\nhand. They knew not what they passed, but they were certain that they\nwere going straight towards their goal. And as they went along, the\ngarden became gradually graver, more discreet; the soughing of the\nbranches died away, the streams hushed their plashing waters, the birds,\nthe beasts, and the insects fell into silence. All around them reigned\nsolemn stillness.\n\nThen Albine and Serge instinctively raised their heads. In front of them\nthey beheld a colossal mass of foliage; and, as they hesitated for a\nmoment, a roe, after gazing at them with its sweet soft eyes, bounded\ninto the thickets.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is there,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Albine.\n\nShe led the way, her face again turned towards Serge, whom she drew with\nher, and they disappeared amid the quivering leaves, and all grew quiet\nagain. They were entering into delicious peace.\n\nIn the centre there stood a tree covered with so dense a foliage that\none could not recognise its species. It was of giant girth, with a trunk\nthat seemed to breathe like a living breast, and far-reaching boughs\nthat stretched like protecting arms around it. It towered up there\nbeautiful, strong, virile, and fruitful. It was the king of the garden,\nthe father of the forest, the pride of the plants, the beloved of the\nsun, whose earliest and latest beams smiled daily on its crest. From its\ngreen vault poured all the joys of creation: fragrance of flowers, music\nof birds, gleams of golden light, wakeful freshness of dawn, slumbrous\nwarmth of evening twilight. So strong was the sap that it burst through\nthe very bark, bathing the tree with the powers of fruitfulness, making\nit the symbol of earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s virility. Its presence sufficed to give the\nclearing an enchanting charm. The other trees built up around it an\nimpenetrable wall, which isolated it as in a sanctuary of silence\nand twilight. There was but greenery there, not a scrap of sky, not a\nglimpse of horizon; nothing but a swelling rotunda, draped with green\nsilkiness of leaves, adorned below with mossy velvet. And one entered,\nas into the liquid crystal of a source, a greenish limpidity, a sheet\nof silver reposing beneath reflected reeds. Colours, perfumes, sounds,\nquivers, all were vague, indeterminate, transparent, steeped in a\nfelicity amidst which everything seemed to faint away. Languorous\nwarmth, the glimmer of a summer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s night, as it fades on the bare\nshoulder of some fair girl, a scarce perceptible murmur of love sinking\ninto silence, lingered beneath the motionless branches, unstirred by the\nslightest zephyr. It was hymeneal solitude, a chamber where Nature lay\nhidden in the embraces of the sun.\n\nAlbine and Serge stood there in an ecstasy of joy. As soon as the tree\nhad received them beneath its shade, they felt eased of all the anxious\ndisquiet which had so long distressed them. The fears which had made\nthem avoid each other, the fierce wrestling of spirit which had torn\nand wounded them, without consciousness on their part of what they were\nreally contending against, vanished, and left them in perfect peace.\nAbsolute confidence, supreme serenity, now pervaded them, they yielded\nunhesitatingly to the joy of being together in that lonely nook,\nso completely hidden from the outside world. They had surrendered\nthemselves to the garden, they awaited in all calmness the behests of\nthat tree of life. It enveloped them in such ecstasy of love that the\nwhole clearing seemed to disappear from before their eyes, and to leave\nthem wrapped in an atmosphere of perfume.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The air is like ripe fruit,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 murmured Albine.\n\nAnd Serge whispered in his turn: \u00e2\u0080\u0098The grass seems so full of life and\nmotion, that I could almost think I was treading on your dress.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nIt was a kind of religious feeling which made them lower their voices.\nNo sentiment of curiosity impelled them to raise their heads and scan\nthe tree. The consciousness of its majesty weighed heavily upon them.\nWith a glance Albine asked whether she had overrated the enchantment of\nthe greenery, and Serge answered her with two tears that trickled\ndown his cheeks. The joy that filled them at being there could not be\nexpressed in words.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Come,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she whispered in his ear, in a voice that was softer than a\nsigh.\n\nAnd she glided on in front of him, and seated herself at the very foot\nof the tree. Then, with a fond smile, she stretched out her hands to\nhim; while he, standing before her, grasped them in his own with a\nresponsive smile. Then she drew him slowly towards her and he sank down\nby her side.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! do you remember,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098that wall which seemed to have grown up\nbetween us? Now there is nothing to keep us apart--you are not unhappy\nnow?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No, no,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she answered; \u00e2\u0080\u0098very happy.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nFor a moment they relapsed into silence whilst soft emotion stole over\nthem. Then Serge, caressing Albine, exclaimed: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Your face is mine; your\neyes, your mouth, your cheeks are mine. Your arms are mine, from your\nshoulders to the tips of your nails. You are wholly mine.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And as he\nspoke he kissed her lips, her eyes, her cheeks. He kissed her arms, with\nquick short kisses, from her fingers to her shoulders. He poured upon\nher a rain of kisses hot as a summer shower, deluging her cheeks, her\nforehead, her lips, and her neck.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But if you are mine, I am yours,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said he; \u00e2\u0080\u0098yours for ever; for I now\nwell know that you are my queen, my sovereign, whom I must worship\non bended knee. I am here only to obey you, to lie at your feet, to\nanticipate your wishes, to shelter you with my arms, to drive away\nwhatever might trouble your tranquillity. And you are my life\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goal.\nSince I first awoke in this garden, you have ever been before me; I have\ngrown up that I might be yours. Ever, as my end, my reward, have I\ngazed upon your grace. You passed in the sunshine with the sheen of\nyour golden hair; you were a promise that I should some day know all the\nmysteries and necessities of creation, of this earth, of these trees,\nthese waters, these skies, whose last secret is yet unrevealed. I belong\nto you; I am your slave; I will listen to you and obey you, with my lips\nupon your feet.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe said this, bowed to the ground, adoring Woman. And Albine, full of\npride, allowed herself to be adored. She yielded her hands, her cheeks,\nher lips, to Serge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rapturous kisses. She felt herself indeed a queen\nas she saw him, who was so strong, bending so humbly before her. She had\nconquered him, and held him there at her mercy. With a single word\nshe could dispose of him. And that which helped her to recognise\nher omnipotence was that she heard the whole garden rejoicing at her\ntriumph, with gradually swelling paeans of approval.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! if we could fly off together, if we could but die even, in one\nanother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arms,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 faltered Serge, scarce able to articulate. But Albine\nhad strength enough to raise her finger as though to bid him listen.\n\nIt was the garden that had planned and willed it all. For weeks and\nweeks it had been favouring and encouraging their passion, and at last,\non that supreme day, it had lured them to that spot, and now it became\nthe Tempter whose every voice spoke of love. From the flower-beds, amid\nthe fragrance of the languid blossoms, was wafted a soft sighing, which\ntold of the weddings of the roses, the love-joys of the violets; and\nnever before had the heliotropes sent forth so voluptuous a perfume.\nMingled with the soft air which arose from the orchard were all the\nexhalations of ripe fruit, the vanilla of apricots, the musk of oranges,\nall the luscious aroma of fruitfulness. From the meadows came fuller\nnotes, the million sighs of the sun-kissed grass, the multitudinous\nlove-plaints of legions of living things, here and there softened by\nthe refreshing caresses of the rivulets, on whose banks the very willows\npalpitated with desire. And the forest proclaimed the mighty passion of\nthe oaks. Through the high branches sounded solemn music, organ strains\nlike the nuptial marches of the ashes and the birches, the hornbeams\nand the planes, while from the bushes and the young coppices arose noisy\nmirth like that of youthful lovers chasing one another over banks and\ninto hollows amid much crackling and snapping of branches. From afar,\ntoo, the faint breeze wafted the sounds of the rocks splitting in their\npassion beneath the burning heat, while near them the spiky plants\nloved in a tragic fashion of their own, unrefreshed by the neighbouring\nsprings, which themselves glowed with the love of the passionate sun.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What do they say?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 asked Serge, half swooning, as Albine pressed him to\nher bosom. The voices of the Paradou were growing yet more distinct.\nThe animals, in their turn, joined in the universal song of nature.\nThe grasshoppers grew faint with the passion of their chants; the\nbutterflies scattered kisses with their beating wings. The amorous\nsparrows flew to their mates; the rivers rippled over the loves of the\nfishes; whilst in the depths of the forest the nightingales sent forth\npearly, voluptuous notes, and the stags bellowed their love aloud.\nReptiles and insects, every species of invisible life, every atom of\nmatter, the earth itself joined in the great chorus. It was the chorus\nof love and of nature--the chorus of the whole wide world; and in the\nvery sky the clouds were radiant with rapture, as to those two children\nLove revealed the Eternity of Life.\n\n\n\n\nXVI\n\nAlbine and Serge smiled at one another.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I love you, Albine,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Serge.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Serge, I love you,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Albine answered.\n\nAnd never before had those syllables \u00e2\u0080\u0098I love you\u00e2\u0080\u0099 had for them so\nsupreme a meaning. They expressed everything. Joy pervaded those young\nlovers, who had attained to the fulness of life. They felt that they\nwere now on a footing of equality with the forces of the world; and with\ntheir happiness mingled the placid conviction that they had obeyed the\nuniversal law. And Serge seemed to have awakened to life, lion-like,\nto rule the whole far expanse under the free heavens. His feet planted\nthemselves more firmly on the ground, his chest expanded, there was\npride and confidence in his gait and demeanour. He took Albine by the\nhands, she was trembling, and he was obliged to support her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be afraid,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said; \u00e2\u0080\u0098you are she whom I love.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nIt was Albine now who had become the submissive one. She drooped her\nhead upon his shoulder, glancing up at him with anxious scrutiny. Would\nhe never bear her spite for that hour of adoration in which he had\ncalled himself her slave? But he smiled, and stroked her hair, while\nshe said to him: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Let me stay like this, in your arms, for I cannot\nwalk without you. I will make myself so small and light, that you will\nscarcely know I am there.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Then becoming very serious she added, \u00e2\u0080\u0098You\nmust always love me; and I will be very obedient and do whatever you\nwish. I will yield to you in all things if you but love me.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nSerge felt more powerful and virile on seeing her so humble. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Why are\nyou trembling so?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he asked her; \u00e2\u0080\u0098I can have no cause to reproach you.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut she did not answer him, she gazed almost sadly upon the tree and the\nfoliage and the grass around them.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Foolish child!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said, laughing; \u00e2\u0080\u0098are you afraid that I shall be\nangry with you for your love? We have loved as we were meant to love.\nLet me kiss you.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut, dropping her eyelids so that she might not see the tree, she said,\nin a low whisper, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Take me away!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nSerge led her thence, pacing slowly and giving one last glance at the\nspot which love had hallowed. The shadows in the clearing were growing\ndarker, and a gentle quiver coursed through the foliage. When they\nemerged from the wood and caught sight of the sun, still shining\nbrightly in the horizon, they felt easier. Everything around Serge now\nseemed to bend down before him and pay homage to his love. The garden\nwas now nothing but an appanage of Albine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beauty, and seemed to have\ngrown larger and fairer amid the love-kisses of its rulers.\n\nBut Albine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s joy was still tinged with disquietude. She would suddenly\npause amid her laughter and listen anxiously.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What is the matter?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 asked Serge.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Nothing,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she replied, casting furtive glances behind her.\n\nThey did not know in what out-of-the-way corner of the park they were.\nTo lose themselves in their capricious wanderings only served to amuse\nthem as a rule; but that day they experienced anxious embarrassment. By\ndegrees they quickened their pace, plunging more and more deeply into a\nlabyrinth of bushes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you hear?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 asked Albine, nervously, as she suddenly stopped\nshort, almost breathless.\n\nSerge listened, a prey, in his turn, to the anxiety which the girl could\nno longer conceal.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098All the coppice seems full of voices,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she continued. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It sounds as\nthough there were people deriding us. Listen! Wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that a laugh\nthat sounded from that tree? And over yonder did not the grass murmur\nsomething as my dress brushed against it?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No, no,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said, anxious to reassure her, \u00e2\u0080\u0098the garden loves us; and,\nif it said anything, it would not be to vex or annoy us. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you\nremember all the sweet words which sounded through the leaves? You are\nnervous and fancy things.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut she shook her head and faltered: \u00e2\u0080\u0098I know very well that the garden\nis our friend.... So it must be some one who has broken into it. I am\ncertain I hear some one. I am trembling all over. Oh! take me away and\nhide me somewhere, I beseech you.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen they went on again, scanning every tree and bush, and imagining\nthat they could see faces peering at them from behind every trunk.\nAlbine was certain, she said, that there were steps pursuing them in the\ndistance. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Let us hide ourselves,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she begged.\n\nShe had turned quite scarlet. It was new-born modesty, a sense of\nshame which had laid hold of her like a fever, mantling over the snowy\nwhiteness of her skin, which never previously had known that flush.\nSerge was alarmed at seeing her thus crimson, her face full of distress,\nher eyes brimming with tears. He tried to clasp her in his arms again\nand to soothe her with a caress; but she slipped away from him, and,\nwith a despairing gesture, made sign that they were not alone. And her\nblushes grew deeper as her eyes fell upon her bare arms. She shuddered\nwhen her loose hanging hair stirred against her neck and shoulders.\nThe slightest touch of a waving bough or a passing insect, the softest\nbreath of air, now made her tremble as if some invisible hand were\ngrasping at her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Calm yourself,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 begged Serge, \u00e2\u0080\u0098there is no one. You are as crimson as\nthough you had a fever. Let us rest here for a moment. Do; I beg you.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe had no fever at all, she said, but she wanted to get back as quickly\nas possible, so that no one might laugh at her. And, ever increasing her\npace, she plucked handfuls of leaves and tendrils from the hedges, which\nshe entwined about her. She fastened a branch of mulberry over her hair,\ntwisted bindweed round her arms, and tied it to her wrists, and circled\nher neck with such long sprays of laurustinus, that her bosom was hidden\nas by a veil of leaves.\n\nAnd that shame of hers proved contagious. Serge, who first had jested,\nasking her if she were going to a ball, glanced at himself, and likewise\nfelt alarmed and ashamed, to a point that he also wound foliage about\nhis person.\n\nMeantime, they could discover no way out of the labyrinth of bushes, but\nall at once, at the end of the path, they found themselves face to face\nwith an obstacle, a tall, grey, grave mass of stone. It was the wall of\nthe Paradou.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Come away! come away!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cried Albine.\n\nAnd she sought to drag him thence; but they had not taken another twenty\nsteps before they again came upon the wall. They then skirted it at a\nran, panic-stricken. It stretched along, gloomy and stern, without\na break in its surface. But suddenly, at a point where it fringed a\nmeadow, it seemed to fall away. A great breach gaped in it, like a huge\nwindow of light opening on to the neighbouring valley. It must have been\nthe very hole that Albine had one day spoken of, which she said she had\nblocked up with brambles and stones. But the brambles now lay scattered\naround like severed bits of rope, the stones had been thrown some\ndistance away, and the breach itself seemed to have been enlarged by\nsome furious hand.\n\n\n\n\nXVII\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! I felt sure of it,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cried Albine, in accents of supreme despair.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I begged you to take me away--Serge, I beseech you, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look through\nit.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut Serge, in spite of himself, stood rooted to the ground, on the\nthreshold of the breach through which he gazed. Down below, in the\ndepths of the valley, the setting sun cast a sheet of gold upon the\nvillage of Les Artaud, which showed vision-like amidst the twilight in\nwhich the neighbouring fields were already steeped. One could plainly\ndistinguish the houses that straggled along the high road; the little\nyards with their dunghills, and the narrow gardens planted with\nvegetables. Higher up, the tall cypress in the graveyard reared its\ndusky silhouette, and the red tiles on the church glowed brazier-like,\nthe dark bell looking down on them like a human face, while the old\nparsonage at the side threw its doors and windows open to the evening\nair.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098For pity\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sobbed Albine, \u00e2\u0080\u0098don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look out, Serge. Remember that\nyou promised you would always love me. Ah! will you ever love me enough,\nnow? Stay, let me cover your eyes with my hands. You know it was my\nhands that cured you. You won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t push me away.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut he put her from him gently. Then, while she fell down and clung to\nhis legs, he passed his hands across his face, as though he were wiping\nfrom his brow and eyes some last lingering traces of sleep. It was\nyonder, then, that lay the unknown world, the strange land of which he\nhad never dreamed without vague fear. Where had he seen that country?\nFrom what dream was he awakening, that he felt such keen anguish\nswelling up in his breast till it almost choked him? The village was\nbreaking out into life at the close of the day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work. The men were\ncoming home from the fields with weary gait, their jackets thrown over\ntheir shoulders; the women, standing by their doors, were beckoning to\nthem to hasten on; while the children, in noisy bands, chased the\nfowls about and pelted them with stones. In the churchyard a couple of\nscapegraces, a lad and a girl, were creeping along under the shelter of\nthe wall in order to escape notice. Swarms of sparrows were retiring\nto roost beneath the eaves of the church; and, on the steps of the\nparsonage, a blue calico skirt had just appeared, of such spreading\ndimensions as to quite block the doorway.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh! he is looking out! he is looking out!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sobbed Albine. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Listen to\nme. It was only just now that you promised to obey me. I beg of you to\nturn round and to look upon the garden. Haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you been very happy in\nthe garden? It was the garden which gave me to you. Think of the happy\ndays it has in store for us, what lasting bliss and enjoyment. Instead\nof which it will be death that will force its way through that hole,\nif you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quickly flee and take me with you. See, all those people\nyonder will come and thrust themselves between us. We were so quite\nalone, so secluded, so well guarded by the trees! Oh! the garden is our\nlove! Look on the garden, I beg it of you on my knees!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut Serge was quivering. He had began to recollect. The past was\nre-awakening. He could distinctly hear the stir of the village life.\nThose peasants, those women and children, he knew them. There was the\nmayor, Bambousse, returning from Les Olivettes, calculating how much\nthe approaching vintage would yield him; there were the Brichets, the\nhusband crawling along, and the wife moaning with misery. There was\nRosalie flirting with big Fortune behind a wall. He recognised also the\npair in the churchyard, that mischievous Vincent and that bold hussy\nCatherine, who were catching big grasshoppers amongst the tombstones.\nYes, and they had Voriau, the black dog, with them, helping them and\nferreting about in the dry grass, and sniffing at every crack in the old\nstones. Under the eaves of the church the sparrows were twittering\nand bickering before going to roost. The boldest of them flew down and\nentered the church through the broken windows, and, as Serge followed\nthem with his eyes, he recollected all the noise they had formerly made\nbelow the pulpit and on the step by the altar rails, where crumbs were\nalways put for them. And that was La Teuse yonder, on the parsonage\ndoorstep, looking fatter than ever in her blue calico dress. She was\nturning her head to smile at Desiree, who was coming up from the yard,\nlaughing noisily. Then they both vanished indoors, and Serge, distracted\nwith all these revived memories, stretched out his arms.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is all over now,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 faltered Albine, as she sank down amongst the\nbroken brambles. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You will never love me enough again.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe wept, while Serge stood rooted by the breach, straining his ears\nto catch the slightest sound that might be wafted from the village,\nwaiting, as it were, for some voice that might fully awaken him. The\nbell in the church-tower had begun to sway, and slowly through the quiet\nevening air the three chimes of the _Angelus_ floated up to the Paradou.\nIt was a soft and silvery summons. The bell now seemed to be alive.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098O God!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cried Serge, falling on his knees, quite overcome by the\nemotion which the soft notes of the bell had excited in him.\n\nHe bent down towards the ground, and he felt the three peals of the\n_Angelus_ pass over his neck and echo through his heart. The voice of\nthe bell seemed to grow louder. It was raised again sternly, pitilessly,\nfor a few moments which seemed to him to be years. It summoned up\nbefore him all his old life, his pious childhood, his happy days at the\nseminary, and his first Masses in that burning valley of Les Artaud,\nwhere he had dreamt of a solitary, saintly life. He had always heard it\nspeaking to him as it was doing now. He recognised every inflection of\nthat sacred voice, which had so constantly fallen upon his ears, like\nthe grave and gentle voice of a mother. Why had he so long ceased to\nhear it? In former times it had promised him the coming of Mary. Had\nMary come then and taken him and carried him off into those happy green\nfastnesses, which the sound of the bell could not reach? He would never\nhave lapsed into forgetfulness if the bell had not ceased to ring. And\nas he bent his head still lower towards the earth, the contact of his\nbeard with his hands made him start. He could not recognise his own self\nwith that long silky beard. He twisted it and fumbled about in his hair\nseeking for the bare circle of the tonsure, but a heavy growth of curls\nnow covered his whole head from his brow to the nape of his neck.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! you were right,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said, casting a look of despair at Albine.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It was forbidden. We have sinned, and we have merited some terrible\npunishment.... But I, indeed, I tried to reassure you, I did not hear\nthe threats which sounded in your ears through the branches.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAlbine tried to clasp him in her arms again as she sobbed out, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Get up,\nand let us escape together. Perhaps even yet there is time for us to\nlove each other.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No, no; I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the strength. I should stumble and fall over the\nsmallest pebble in the path. Listen to me. I am afraid of myself. I know\nnot what man dwells in me. I have murdered myself, and my hands are red\nwith blood. If you took me away, you would never see aught in my eyes\nsave tears.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe kissed his wet eyes, as she answered passionately, \u00e2\u0080\u0098No matter! Do\nyou love me?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe was too terrified to answer her. A heavy step set the pebbles rolling\non the other side of the wall. A growl of anger seemed to draw nigh.\nAlbine had not been mistaken. Some one was, indeed, there, disturbing\nthe woodland quiet with jealous inquisition. Then both Albine and Serge,\nas if overwhelmed with shame, sought to bide themselves behind a bush.\nBut Brother Archangias, standing in front of the breach, could already\nsee them.\n\nThe Brother remained for a moment silent, clenching his fists and\nlooking at Albine clinging round Serge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s neck, with the disgust of a man\nwho has espied some filth by the roadside.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I suspected it,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he mumbled between his teeth. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It was virtually\ncertain that they had hidden him here.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen he took a few steps, and cried out: \u00e2\u0080\u0098I see you. It is an\nabomination. Are you a brute beast to go coursing through the woods with\nthat female? She has led you far astray, has she not? She has besmeared\nyou with filth, and now you are hairy like a goat.... Pluck a branch\nfrom the trees wherewith to smite her on the back.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAgain Albine whispered in an ardent, prayerful voice: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Do you love me?\nDo you love me?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut Serge, with bowed head, kept silence, though he did not yet drive\nher from him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Fortunately, I have found you,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 continued Brother Archangias. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I\ndiscovered this hole.... You have disobeyed God, and have slain your own\npeace. Henceforward, for ever, temptation will gnaw you with its fiery\ntooth, and you will no longer have ignorance of evil to help you to\nfight it. It was that creature who tempted you to your fall, was it not?\nDo you not see the serpent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tail writhing amongst her hair? The mere\nsight of her shoulders is sufficient to make one vomit with disgust....\nLeave her. Touch her not, for she is the beginning of hell. In the name\nof God, come forth from that garden.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Do you love me? Oh! do you love me?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 reiterated Albine.\n\nBut Serge hastily drew away from her as though her bare arms and\nshoulders really scorched him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098In the name of God! In the name of God!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cried the Brother, in a voice\nof thunder.\n\nSerge unresistingly stepped towards the breach. As soon as Brother\nArchangias, with rough violence, had dragged him out of the Paradou,\nAlbine, who had fallen half fainting to the ground, with hands wildly\nstretched towards the love which was deserting her, rose up again,\nchoking with sobs. And she fled, vanished into the midst of the trees,\nwhose trunks she lashed with her streaming hair.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK III\n\n\n\n\nI\n\nWhen Abbe Mouret had said the _Pater_, he bowed to the altar, and went\nto the Epistle side. Then he came down, and made the sign of the cross\nover big Fortune and Rosalie, who were kneeling, side by side, before\nthe altar-rails.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098_Ego conjungo vos in matrimonium, in nomine Patris, et Filii, et\nSpiritus Sancti_.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098_Amen_,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 responded Vincent, who was serving the mass, and glancing\ncuriously at his big brother out of the corner of his eye.\n\nFortune and Rosalie bent their heads, affected by some slight emotion,\nalthough they had nudged each other with their elbows when they knelt\ndown, by way of making one another laugh. But Vincent went to get the\nbasin and the sprinkler. Fortune placed the ring in the basin, a thick\nring of solid silver. When the priest had blessed it, sprinkling it\ncrosswise, he returned it to Fortune, who slipped it upon Rosalie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nfinger. Her hand was still discoloured with grass-stains, which soap had\nnot been able to remove.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098_In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti_,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Abbe Mouret murmured\nagain, giving them a final benediction.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098_Amen_,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 responded Vincent.\n\nIt was early morning. The sun was not yet shining through the big\nwindows of the church. Outside one could hear the noisy twittering of\nthe sparrows in the branches of the service tree, whose foliage shot\nthrough the broken panes. La Teuse, who had not previously had time to\nclean the church, was now dusting the altar, craning up on her sound leg\nto wipe the feet of the ochre and lake-bedaubed Christ, and arranging\nthe chairs as quietly as possible; all the while bowing and crossing\nherself, and following the service, but not omitting a single sweep of\nher feather broom. Quite alone, at the foot of the pulpit, was mother\nBrichet, praying in a very demonstrative fashion. She kept on her knees,\nand repeated the prayers in so loud a whisper that it seemed as if a\nswarm of bluebottles had taken possession of the nave.\n\nAt the other end of the church near the confessional, Catherine held\nan infant in swaddling clothes. As it began to cry, she turned her back\nupon the altar, and tossed it up, and amused it with the bell-rope,\nwhich dangled just over its nose.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098_Dominus vobiscum_,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the priest, turning round, and spreading out\nhis hands.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098_Et cum spiritu tuo_,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 responded Vincent.\n\nAt that moment three big girls came into the church. They were too shy\nto go far up, though they jostled one another to get a better view of\nwhat was going on. They were three friends of Rosalie, who had dropped\nin for a minute or two on their way to the fields, curious as they were\nto hear what his reverence would say to the bride and bridegroom. They\nhad big scissors hanging at their waists. At last they hid themselves\nbehind the font, where they pinched each other and twisted themselves\nabout, while trying to choke their bursts of laughter with their\nclenched fists.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 whispered La Rousse, a finely built girl, with copper-coloured\nskin and hair, \u00e2\u0080\u0098there won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be any scrimmage to get out of church when\nit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all over.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh! old Bambousse is quite right,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 murmured Lisa, a short dark girl,\nwith gleaming eyes; \u00e2\u0080\u0098when one has vines, one looks after them. Since his\nreverence so particularly desired to marry Rosalie, he can very well do\nit all alone.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe other girl, Babet, who was humpbacked, tittered. \u00e2\u0080\u0098There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother\nBrichet,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said; \u00e2\u0080\u0098she is always here. She prays for the whole family.\nListen, do you hear how she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s buzzing? All that will mean something in\nher pocket. She knows very well what she is about, I can tell you.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098She is playing the organ for them,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 retorted La Rousse.\n\nAt this all three burst into a laugh. La Teuse, in the distance,\nthreatened them with her broom. At the altar, Abbe Mouret was taking the\nsacrament. As he went from the Epistle side towards Vincent, so that the\nwater of ablution might be poured upon his thumb and fore-finger, Lisa\nsaid more softly: \u00e2\u0080\u0098It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nearly over. He will begin to talk to them\ndirectly.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said La Rousse, \u00e2\u0080\u0098and so big Fortune will still be able to go to\nhis work, and Rosalie won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t lose her day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pay at the vintage. It is\nvery convenient to be married so early in the morning. He looks very\nsheepish, that big Fortune.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Of course,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 murmured Babet. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It tires him, keeping so long on his\nknees. You may be sure that he has never knelt so long since his first\ncommunion.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut the girls\u00e2\u0080\u0099 attention was suddenly distracted by the baby which\nCatherine was dangling in her arms. It wanted to get hold of the\nbell-rope, and was quite blue with rage, frantically stretching out its\nlittle hands and almost choking itself with crying.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! so the youngster is there,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said La Rousse.\n\nThe baby now burst into still louder wailing, and struggled like a\nlittle Imp.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Turn it over on its stomach, and let it suck,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Babet to Catherine.\n\nCatherine lifted up her head, and began to laugh, with the shamelessness\nof a little minx. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not at all amusing,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said, giving the baby a\nshake. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Be quiet, will you, little pig! My sister plumped it down on my\nknees.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Naturally,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Babet, mischievously. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You could scarcely have\nexpected her to give the brat to Monsieur le Cure to nurse.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAt this sally, La Rousse almost fell over in a fit of laughter. She\nleaned against the wall, holding her sides with her hands. Lisa threw\nherself against her, and attempted to soothe her by pinching her back\nand shoulders; while Babet laughed with a hunchback\u00e2\u0080\u0099s laugh, which\ngrated on the ear like the sound of a saw.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098If it hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been for the little one,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she continued, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Monsieur le Cure\nwould have lost all use for his holy water. Old Bambousse had made up\nhis mind to marry Rosalie to young Laurent, of Figuieres.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHowever, the girls\u00e2\u0080\u0099 merriment and their chatter now came to an end, for\nthey saw La Teuse limping furiously towards them. At this the three big\nhussies felt alarmed, stepped back, and subsided into sedateness.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You worthless things!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 hissed La Teuse. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You come to talk a lot of\nfilth here, do you? Aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you ashamed of yourself, La Rousse? You ought\nto be there, on your knees, before the altar, like Rosalie. I will throw\nyou outside if you stir again. Do you hear?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nLa Rousse\u00e2\u0080\u0099s copper cheeks were tinged with a rising blush, and Babet\nglanced at her and tittered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And you,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 continued La Teuse, turning towards Catherine, \u00e2\u0080\u0098just you\nleave that baby alone. You are pinching it on purpose to make it scream.\nDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell me you are not. Give it to me.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe took the child, hushed it in her arms for a moment, and then laid\nit upon a chair, where it went to sleep, peacefully like a cherub.\nThe church then subsided into solemn quietness, disturbed only by the\nchattering of the sparrows on the rowan tree outside. At the altar,\nVincent had carried the missal to the right again, and Abbe Mouret had\njust folded the corporal and slipped it within the burse. He was now\nsaying the concluding prayers with a solemn earnestness, which neither\nthe screams of the baby nor the giggling of the three girls had been\nable to disturb. He seemed to hear nothing of them, but to be wholly\nabsorbed in the prayers which he was offering up to Heaven for the\nhappiness of the pair whose union he had just blessed. The sky that\nmorning was grey with a hazy heat, which veiled the sun. Through the\nbroken windows a russet vapour streamed into the church, betokening\na stormy day. Along the walls the gaudily coloured pictures of the\nStations of the Cross displayed their red, blue, and yellow patches;\nat the bottom of the nave the dry woodwork of the gallery creaked and\nstrained; and under the doorway the tall grass by the steps thrust\nripening straw, all alive with little brown grasshoppers. The clock,\nin its wooden case, made a whirring noise, as though it were some\nconsumptive trying to clear his throat, and then huskily struck\nhalf-past six.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098_Ite, missa est_,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the priest, turning round to the congregation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098_Deo gratias_,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 responded Vincent.\n\nThen, having kissed the altar, Abbe Mouret once more turned round,\nand murmured over the bent heads of the newly married pair the final\nbenediction: \u00e2\u0080\u0098_Deus Abraham, Deus Isaac, et Deus Jacob vobiscum\nsit_\u00e2\u0080\u0099--his voice dying away into a gentle whisper.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Now, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to address them,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Babet to her friends.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He is very pale,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 observed Lisa. \u00e2\u0080\u0098He isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a bit like Monsieur Caffin,\nwhose fat face always seemed to be on the laugh. My little sister Rose\nsays that she daren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell him anything when she goes to confess.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098All the same,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 murmured La Rousse, \u00e2\u0080\u0098he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not ugly. His illness has aged\nhim a little, but it seems to suit him. He has bigger eyes, and lines at\nthe corners of his mouth which make him look like a man. Before he had\nthe fever, he was too much like a girl.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I believe he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got some great trouble,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Babet. \u00e2\u0080\u0098He looks as though\nhe were pining away. His face is deadly pale, but how his eyes glitter!\nWhen he drops his eyelids, it is just as though he were doing it to\nextinguish the fire in his eyes.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nLa Teuse again shook her broom at them. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Hush!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she hissed out, so\nenergetically that it seemed as if a blast of wind had burst into the\nchurch.\n\nMeantime Abbe Mouret had collected himself, and he began, in a rather\nlow voice:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098My dear brother, my dear sister, you are joined together in Jesus. The\ninstitution of marriage symbolises the sacred union between Jesus and\nHis Church. It is a bond which nothing can break; which God wills shall\nbe eternal, so that man may not sever those whom Heaven has joined. In\nmaking you flesh of each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flesh, and bone of each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bone,\nGod teaches you that it is your duty to walk side by side through\nlife, a faithful couple, along the paths which He, in His omnipotence,\nappoints for you. And you must love each other with God-like love. The\nslightest ill-feeling between you will be disobedience to the Creator,\nWho has joined you together as a single body. Remain, then, for ever\nunited, after the likeness of the Church, which Jesus has espoused, in\ngiving to us all His body and blood.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBig Fortune and Rosalie sat listening, with their noses peaked up\ninquisitively.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What does he say?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 asked Lisa, who was a little deaf.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh! he says what they all say,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 answered La Rousse. \u00e2\u0080\u0098He has a glib\ntongue, like all the priests have.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAbbe Mouret went on with his address, his eyes wandering over the heads\nof the newly wedded couple towards a shadowy corner of the church. And\nby degrees his voice became more flexible, and he put emotion into the\nwords he spoke, words which he had formerly learned by heart from a\nmanual intended for the use of young priests. He had turned slightly\ntowards Rosalie, and whenever his memory failed him, he added sentences\nof his own:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098My dear sister, submit yourself to your husband, as the Church submits\nitself to Jesus. Remember that you must leave everything to follow him,\nlike a faithful handmaiden. You must give up father and mother, you must\ncleave only to your husband, and you must obey him that you may obey God\nalso. And your yoke will be a yoke of love and peace. Be his comfort,\nhis happiness, the perfume of his days of strength, the support of his\ndays of weakness. Let him find you, as a grace, ever by his side. Let\nhim have but to reach out his hand to find yours grasping it. It is thus\nthat you will step along together, never losing your way, and that you\nwill meet with happiness in the carrying out of the divine laws. Oh! my\ndear sister, my dear daughter, your humility will hear sweet fruit; it\nwill give birth to all the domestic virtues, to the joys of the hearth,\nand the prosperity that attends a God-fearing family. Have for your\nhusband the love of Rachel, the wisdom of Rebecca, the constant fidelity\nof Sarah. Tell yourself that a pure life is the source of all happiness.\nPray to God each morning that He may give you strength to live as a\nwoman who respects her responsibilities and duties; for the punishment\nyou would otherwise incur is terrible: you would lose your love. Oh! to\nlive loveless, to tear flesh from flesh, to belong no more to the one\nwho is half of your very self, to live on in pain and agony, bereft of\nthe one you have loved! In vain would you stretch out your arms to him;\nhe would turn away from you. You would yearn for happiness, but you\nwould find in your heart nothing but shame and bitterness. Hear me, my\ndaughter, it is in your own conduct, in your obedience, in your purity,\nin your love, that God has established the strength of your union.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAs Abbe Mouret spoke these words, there was a burst of laughter at the\nother end of the church. The baby had just woke up on the chair where La\nTeuse had laid it. But it was no longer in a bad temper. Having kicked\nitself free of its swaddling clothes, it was laughing merrily, and\nshaking its rosy little feet in the air. It was the sight of these\nlittle feet that made it laugh.\n\nRosalie, who was beginning to find the priest\u00e2\u0080\u0099s address rather tedious,\nturned her head to smile at the child. But, when she saw it kicking\nabout on the chair, she grew alarmed, and cast an angry look at\nCatherine.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh! you can look at me as much as you like,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Catherine. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not\ngoing to take it any more. It would only begin to cry again.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAnd she turned aside to ferret in an ant-hole at a corner of one of the\nstone flags under the gallery.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Monsieur Caffin didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t talk so long,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 now remarked La Rousse. \u00e2\u0080\u0098When he\nmarried Miette, he just gave her two taps on the cheek and told her to\nbe good.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nMy dear brother,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 resumed Abbe Mouret, turning towards big Fortune, \u00e2\u0080\u0098it\nis God who, to-day, gives you a companion, for He does not wish that man\nshould live alone. But, if He ordains that she shall be your servant,\nHe demands from you that you shall be to her a master full of gentleness\nand love. You will love her, because she is part of your own flesh, of\nyour own blood, and your own bone. You will protect her, because God has\ngiven you strong arms only that you may stretch them over her head in\nthe hour of danger. Remember that she is entrusted to you, and that\nyou cannot abuse her submission and weakness without sin. Oh! my dear\nbrother, what proud happiness should be yours! Henceforth, you will no\nlonger live in the selfish egotism of solitude. At all hours you will\nhave a lovable duty before you. There is nothing better than to love,\nunless it be to protect those whom we love. Your heart will expand;\nyour manly strength will increase a hundredfold. Oh! to be a support and\nstay, to have a love given into your keeping, to see a being sink her\nexistence in yours and say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTake me and do with me what you will! I\ntrust myself wholly to you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d And may you be accursed if you ever abandon\nher! It would be a cowardly desertion which God would assuredly punish.\nFrom the moment she gives herself to you, she becomes yours for ever.\nCarry her rather in your arms, and set her not upon the ground until it\nbe certain that she will be there in safety. Give up everything, my dear\nbrother--\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut here the Abbe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice faltered, and only an indistinct murmur came\nfrom his lips. He had quite closed his eyes, his face was deathly white,\nand his voice betokened such deep distress that big Fortune himself shed\ntears without knowing why.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t recovered yet,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lisa. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It is wrong of him to fatigue\nhimself. See, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Fortune crying!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Men are softer-hearted than women,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 murmured Babet.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He spoke very well, all the same,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 remarked La Rousse. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Those priests\nthink of a lot of things that wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t occur to anybody else.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Hush!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cried La Teuse, who was already making ready to extinguish the\ncandles.\n\nBut Abbe Mouret still stammered on, trying to utter a few more\nsentences. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It is for this reason, my dear brother, my dear sister, that\nyou must live in the Catholic Faith, which alone can ensure the peace of\nyour hearth. Your families have taught you to love God, to pray to Him\nevery morning and evening, to look only for the gifts of His mercy--\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe was unable to finish. He turned round, took the chalice off the\naltar, and retired, with bowed head, into the vestry, preceded by\nVincent, who almost let the cruets and napkin fall, in trying to see\nwhat Catherine might be doing at the end of the church.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh! the heartless creature!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Rosalie, who left her husband to go\nand take her baby in her arms. The child laughed. She kissed it, and\nrearranged its swaddling clothes, while threatening Catherine with her\nfist. \u00e2\u0080\u0098If it had fallen,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she cried out, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I would have boxed your ears\nfor you, nicely.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBig Fortune now came slouching along. The three girls stepped towards\nhim, with compressed lips.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098See how proud he is,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 murmured Babet to the others. \u00e2\u0080\u0098He is sure of\ninheriting old Bambousse\u00e2\u0080\u0099s money now. I used to see him creeping along\nevery night under the little wall with Rosalie.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen they giggled, and big Fortune, standing there in front of them,\nlaughed even louder than they did. He pinched La Rousse, and let Lisa\njeer at him. He was a sturdy young blood, and cared nothing for anybody.\nThe priest\u00e2\u0080\u0099s address had annoyed him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Hallo! mother, come on!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he called in his loud voice. But mother\nBrichet was begging at the vestry door. She stood there, tearful and\nwizen, before La Teuse, who was slipping some eggs into the pocket of\nher apron. Fortune didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to feel the least sense of shame. He just\nwinked and remarked: \u00e2\u0080\u0098She is a knowing old card, my mother is. But then\nthe Cure likes to see people at mass.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nMeanwhile, Rosalie had grown calm again. Before leaving the church, she\nasked Fortune if he had begged the priest to come and bless their\nroom, according to the custom of the country. So Fortune ran off to the\nvestry, striding heavily through the church, as if it were a field. He\nsoon reappeared, shouting that his reverence would come. La Teuse, who\nwas scandalised at the noise made by all these people, who seemed to\nthink themselves in a public street, gently clapped her hands, and\npushed them towards the door.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is all over,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said she; \u00e2\u0080\u0098go away and get to your work.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe thought they had all gone, when her eye caught sight of Catherine,\nwhom Vincent had joined. They were bending anxiously over the ants\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nnest. Catherine was poking a long straw into the hole so roughly, that\na swarm of frightened ants had rushed out upon the floor. Vincent\ndeclared, however, that she must get her straw right to the bottom if\nshe wished to find the queen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! you young imps!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cried La Teuse, \u00e2\u0080\u0098what are you after there? Can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nyou leave the poor little things alone? That is Mademoiselle Desiree\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nants\u00e2\u0080\u0099 nest. She would be nicely pleased if she saw you!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAt this the children promptly took to their heels.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nAbbe Mouret, now wearing his cassock but still bareheaded, had come\nback to kneel at the foot of the altar. In the grey light that streamed\nthrough the window, his tonsure showed like a large livid spot amidst\nhis hair; and a slight quiver, as if from cold, sped down his neck. With\nhis hands tightly clasped he was praying earnestly, so absorbed in his\ndevotions that he did not hear the heavy footsteps of La Teuse, who\nhovered around without daring to disturb him. She seemed to be grieved\nat seeing him bowed down there on his knees. For a moment, she thought\nthat he was in tears, and thereupon she went behind the altar to watch\nhim. Since his return, she had never liked to leave him in the church\nalone, for one evening she had found him lying in a dead faint upon the\nflagstones, with icy lips and clenched teeth, like a corpse.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Come in, mademoiselle!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said to Desiree, who was peeping through\nthe vestry-doorway. \u00e2\u0080\u0098He is still here, and he will lay himself up. You\nknow you are the only person that he will listen to.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is breakfast-time,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she replied softly, \u00e2\u0080\u0098and I am very hungry.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen she gently sidled up to the priest, passed an arm round his neck,\nand kissed him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Good morning, brother,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Do you want to make me die of hunger\nthis morning?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe face he turned upon her was so intensely sad, that she kissed\nhim again on both his cheeks. He was emerging from agony. Then, on\nrecognising her, he tried to put her from him, but she kept hold of one\nof his hands and would not release it. She would scarcely allow him to\ncross himself, but insisted upon leading him away.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Come! Come! for I am very hungry. You must be hungry too.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nLa Teuse had laid out the breakfast beneath two big mulberry trees,\nwhose spreading branches formed a sheltering roof at the bottom of the\nlittle garden. The sun, which had at last succeeded in dissipating\nthe stormy-looking vapours of early morning, was warming the beds\nof vegetables, while the mulberry-trees cast a broad shadow over the\nrickety table, on which were laid two cups of milk and some thick slices\nof bread.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You see how nice it looks,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Desiree, delighted at breakfasting in\nthe fresh air.\n\nShe was already cutting some of the bread into strips, which she ate\nwith eager appetite. And as she saw La Teuse still standing in front of\nthem, she said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you eat something?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I shall, presently,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the old servant answered. \u00e2\u0080\u0098My soup is warming.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen, after a moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s silence, looking with admiration at the girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nbig bites, she said to the priest: \u00e2\u0080\u0098It is quite a pleasure to see her.\nDoesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t she make you feel hungry, Monsieur le Cure? You should force\nyourself.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAbbe Mouret smiled as he glanced at his sister. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes, yes,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he murmured;\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098she gets on famously, she grows fatter every day.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because I eat,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Desiree. \u00e2\u0080\u0098If you would eat you would get\nfat, too. Are you ill again? You look very melancholy. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to\nhave it all over again, you know. I was so very lonely when they took\nyou away to cure you.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098She is right,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said La Teuse. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t behave reasonably, Monsieur le\nCure. You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect to be strong, living, as you do, on two or three\ncrumbs a day, as though you were a bird. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make blood; and\nthat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why you are so pale. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you feel ashamed of keeping as thin as\na lath when we are so fat; we who are only women? People will begin to\nthink that we gobble up everything and leave you nothing but the empty\nplates.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen both La Teuse and Desiree, brimful of health and strength, scolded\nhim affectionately. His eyes seemed very large and bright, but empty,\nexpressionless. He was still gently smiling.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am not ill,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said; \u00e2\u0080\u0098I have nearly finished my milk.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 He had\nswallowed two mouthfuls of it, but had not touched the bread.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The animals, now,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Desiree, thoughtfully, \u00e2\u0080\u0098seem to get on much\nmore comfortably than we do. The fowls never have headaches, have they?\nThe rabbits grow as fat as ever one wants them to be. And you never saw\nmy pig looking sad.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen, turning towards her brother, she went on with an air of rapture:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I have named it Matthew, because it is so like that fat man who brings\nthe letters. It is growing so big and strong. It is very unkind of you\nto refuse to come and look at it as you always do. You will come to see\nit some day, won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nWhile she was thus talking she had laid hold of her brother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s share of\nbread, and was eating away at it. She had already finished one piece,\nand was beginning the second, when La Teuse became aware of what she was\ndoing.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098That doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t belong to you, that bread! You are actually stealing his\nfood from him now!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Let her have it,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Abbe Mouret, gently. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have touched\nit myself. Eat it all, my dear, eat it all.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nFor a moment Desiree fell into confusion, with her eyes fixed upon the\nbread, whilst she struggled to check her rising tears. Then she began to\nlaugh, and finished the slice.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098My cow,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said she, continuing her remarks, \u00e2\u0080\u0098is never as sad as you are.\nYou were not here when uncle Pascal gave her to me, on the promise that\nI would be a good girl, or you would have seen how pleased she was when\nI kissed her for the first time.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe paused to listen. A cock crowed in the yard, and a great uproar\nfollowed, with flapping of wings and cackling, grunting, and hoarse\ncries as if the whole yard were in a state of commotion.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! you know,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 resumed Desiree, clapping her hands, \u00e2\u0080\u0098she must be in\ncalf now. I took her to the bull at Beage, three leagues from here.\nThere are very few bulls hereabouts, you know.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nLa Teuse shrugged her shoulders, and glanced at the priest with an\nexpression of annoyance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It would be much better, mademoiselle,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said she, \u00e2\u0080\u0098if you were to go\nand quiet your fowls. They all seem to be murdering one another.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nIndeed, the uproar in the yard had now become so great that the girl was\nalready hurrying off with a great rustling of her petticoats, when the\npriest called her back. \u00e2\u0080\u0098The milk, my dear; you have not finished the\nmilk.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe held out his cup to her, which he had scarcely touched. And she came\nback and drank the milk without the slightest scruple, in spite of La\nTeuse\u00e2\u0080\u0099s angry look. Then she again set off for the poultry-yard, where\nthey soon heard her reducing the fowls to peace and order. She had,\nperhaps, sat down in the midst of them, for she could be heard gently\nhumming as though she were trying to lull them to sleep.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Now my soup is too hot!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 grumbled La Teuse, as she returned from the\nkitchen with a basin, from which a wooden spoon was projecting.\n\nShe placed herself just in front of Abbe Mouret, and began to eat very\ncautiously from the edge of the spoon. She wanted to enliven the Abbe\nand to draw him out of his melancholy moodiness. Ever since he had\nreturned from the Paradou, he had declared himself well again, and\nhad never complained. Often, indeed, he smiled in so soft and sweet a\nfashion, that his fever seemed to have increased his saintliness, at\nleast so thought the villagers. But, at intervals, he had fits of gloomy\nsilence, and appeared to be suffering torture which he strove to bear\nuncomplainingly. It was a mute agony which bore down upon him, and,\nfor hours at a time, left him stupefied, a prey to a frightful inward\nstruggle, the violence of which could only be guessed by the sweat of\nanguish that streamed down his face.\n\nAt such times La Teuse refused to leave him, and overwhelmed him with\na torrent of gossip, until he had gradually recovered tranquillity by\ncrushing the rebellion of his blood. On that particular morning, the old\nservant foresaw a more grievous attack than usual, and poured forth an\namazing flood of talk, while continuing her wary manoeuvres with the\nspoon, which threatened to burn her tongue.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, well,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said she, \u00e2\u0080\u0098one has to live among a lot of wild beasts\nto see such goings-on. Would any one ever think in a decent village of\nbeing married by candlelight? It shows what a poor sort these Artauds\nare. When I was in Normandy, I used to see weddings that threw every one\ninto commotion for a couple of leagues round. They would feast for three\nwhole days. The priest would be there, and the mayor, too; and at the\nmarriage of one of my cousins, all the firemen came as well. And didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nthey have a fine time of it! But to make a priest get up before sunrise\nand marry people before even the chickens have left their roost, why,\nthere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no sense in it! If I had been your reverence, I should have\nrefused to do it. You haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t had your proper sleep, and you may have\ncaught cold in the church. It is that which has upset you. Besides which\nit would be better to marry brute beasts than that Rosalie and her ugly\nlout. That brat of theirs dirtied one of the chairs.--But you ought to\ntell me when you feel poorly, and I could make you something warm.--Eh!\nMonsieur le Cure, speak to me!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe answered, in a feeble voice, that he was quite well, and only needed\na little fresh air. He had just leant against one of the mulberry-trees,\nand was breathing rather quickly, as if faint.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh! all right,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 went on La Teuse, \u00e2\u0080\u0098do just as you like. Go on marrying\npeople when you haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the strength for it, and when you know very\nwell that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bound to upset you. I knew how it would be; I told you so\nyesterday. And if you took my advice, you wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stay where you are.\nThe smell of the yard is bad for you. It is frightful just now. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nimagine what Mademoiselle Desiree can be stirring about there. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nsinging away, and doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to mind it at all. Ah! that reminds me\nof something I want to tell you. You know that I did all I could to keep\nher from taking the cow to Beage; but she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like you, obstinate, and\nwill go her own way. Fortunately, however, for her, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s none the worse\nfor it. She delights to be amongst the animals and their young ones.\nBut come now, your reverence, do be reasonable. Let me take you to your\nroom. You must lie down and rest a little. What, you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to!\nWell, then, so much the worse for you, if you suffer! Besides, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nabsurd to keep one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worries locked up in one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart till they stifle\none.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen, in her indignation, she hastily swallowed a big spoonful of soup\nat the risk of burning her throat. She rattled the handle of the spoon\nagainst the bowl, muttering and grumbling to herself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There never was such a man,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said she. \u00e2\u0080\u0098He would die rather than say\na word. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all very well for him to keep silent. I know quite\nenough, and it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t require much cleverness to guess the rest. Well!\nwell! let him keep it to himself. I dare say it is better.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nLa Teuse was jealous. Dr. Pascal had had a tremendous fight with her\nin order to get her patient away at the time when he had come to the\nconclusion that the young priest\u00e2\u0080\u0099s case would be quite hopeless if he\nshould remain at the parsonage. He had then explained to her that the\nsound of the bell would aggravate and intensify Serge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fever, that the\nreligious pictures and statuettes scattered about his room would fill\nhis brain with hallucinations, and that entirely new surroundings\nwere necessary if he was to be restored to health and strength and\npeacefulness of mind. She, however, had vigorously shaken her head, and\ndeclared that her \u00e2\u0080\u0098dear child\u00e2\u0080\u0099 would nowhere find a better nurse than\nherself. Still, she had ended by yielding. She had even resigned\nherself to seeing him go to the Paradou, though protesting against this\nselection of the doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, which astonished her. But she retained\na strong feeling of hatred for the Paradou; and she was hurt by the\nsilence which Abbe Mouret maintained as to the time he had spent there.\nShe had frequently laid all sorts of unsuccessful traps to induce him\nto talk of it. That morning, exasperated by his ghastly pallor, and his\nobstinacy in suffering in silence, she ended by waving her spoon about\nand crying:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You should go back yonder again, Monsieur le Cure, if you were so happy\nthere--I dare say there is some one there who would nurse you better\nthan I do.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nIt was the first time she had ventured upon a direct allusion to her\nsuspicions. The blow was so painful to the priest that he could not\ncheck a slight cry, as he raised his grief-racked countenance. At this\nLa Teuse\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kindly heart was filled with regret.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she murmured, \u00e2\u0080\u0098it is all the fault of your uncle Pascal. I told\nhim what it would be. But those clever men cling so obstinately to their\nown ideas. Some of them would kill you, just for the sake of rummaging\nin your body afterwards--It made me so angry that I would never speak of\nit to any one. Yes, Monsieur le Cure, you have me to thank that nobody\nknew where you were; I was so angry about it. I thought it abominable!\nWhen Abbe Guyot, from Saint-Eutrope, who took your place during your\nabsence, came to say mass here on Sundays, I told him all sorts of\nstories. I said you had gone to Switzerland. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even know where\nSwitzerland is.--Well! well! I surely don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to say anything to pain\nyou, but it was certainly over yonder that you got your trouble. Very\nfinely they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve cured you indeed! It would have been very much better if\nthey had left you with me. I shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have thought of trying to turn\nyour head.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAbbe Mouret, whose brow was again lowered, made no attempt to interrupt\nher. La Teuse had seated herself upon the ground a few yards away from\nhim, in order if possible to catch his eye. And she went on again in her\nmotherly way, delighted at his seeming complacency in listening to her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You would never let me tell you about Abbe Caffin. As soon as I began\nto speak of him, you always made me stop. Well, well; Abbe Caffin had\nhad his troubles in my part of the world, at Canteleu. And yet he was a\nvery holy man, with an irreproachable character. But, you see, he was\na man of very delicate taste, and liked soft pretty things. Well, there\nwas a young party who was always prowling round him, the daughter of a\nmiller, whom her parents had sent to a boarding-school. Well, to put it\nshortly, what was likely to happen did happen. When the story got about,\nall the neighbourhood was very indignant with the Abbe. But he managed\nto escape to Rouen, and poured out his grief to the Archbishop there.\nThen he was sent here. The poor man was punished quite enough by being\nmade to live in this hole of a place. I heard of the girl afterwards.\nShe had married a cattle-dealer, and was very happy.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nLa Teuse, delighted at having been allowed to tell her story,\ninterpreted the priest\u00e2\u0080\u0099s silence as an encouragement to continue her\ngossiping. So she drew a little nearer to him and said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He was very friendly with me, was good Monsieur Caffin, and often spoke\nto me of his sin. It won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t keep him out of heaven, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure. He can rest\nquite peacefully out there under the turf, for he never harmed any one.\nFor my part, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand why people should get so angry with a\npriest when such a thing unhappily befalls him. Of course it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wrong,\nand likely to anger God; but then one can confess and repent, and get\nabsolution. Isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it so, your reverence, that when one truly repents,\none is saved in spite of one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sins?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAbbe Mouret slowly raised his head. By a supreme effort he had overcome\nhis agony, and though his face was still very pale, he exclaimed in a\nfirm voice, \u00e2\u0080\u0098One should never sin; never! never!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! sir,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cried the old servant, \u00e2\u0080\u0098you are too proud and reserved. It is\nnot a nice thing, that pride of yours.--If I were in your place, I would\nnot harden myself like that. I would talk of what was troubling me, and\nnot try to rend my heart in pieces. You should reconcile yourself to the\nseparation gradually. The worry wears off little by little. But, instead\nof that, you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even allow people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s names to be uttered. You forbid\nthem to be mentioned. It is as though they were dead. Since you came\nback, I have not dared to tell you the least bit of news. Well, well,\nI am going to speak now, and I shall tell you all I know; because I see\nquite well that it is all this silence that is preying upon your heart.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe looked at her sternly, and lifted his finger to silence her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes, yes,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she went on, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I get news from over yonder, very often\nindeed, and I am going to tell it to you. To begin with, there is some\none there who is no happier than you are.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Silence! Silence!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Abbe Mouret, summoning all his strength to rise\nand move away.\n\nBut La Teuse also rose and barred his way with her bulky figure. She was\nangry, and cried out:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There, you see, you want to be off already! But you are going to listen\nto me. You know quite well that I am not over fond of the people yonder,\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you? If I talk to you about them, it is for your own good. Some\npeople say that I am jealous. Well, one day I mean to take you over\nthere. You would be with me, and you wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be afraid of any harm\nhappening. Will you go?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe motioned her away from him with his hands, and his face was calm\nagain as he said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I desire nothing. I wish to know nothing. There is high mass to-morrow.\nYou must see that the altar is made ready.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen, as he walked away, he added, smiling:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be uneasy, my good Teuse. I am stronger than you imagine. I shall\nbe able to cure myself without any one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assistance.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nWith these words he went off, bearing himself sturdily, with his head\nerect, for he had vanquished his feelings. His cassock rustled very\ngently against the borders of thyme. La Teuse, who for a moment had\nremained rooted to the spot where she was standing, sulkily picked up\nher basin and wooden spoon. Then, shrugging her big shoulders again and\nagain, she mumbled between her teeth:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all bravado of his. He imagines that he is differently made from\nother men, just because he is a priest. Well, as a matter of fact, he is\nvery firm and determined. I have known some who wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have had to be\nwheedled so long. And he is quite capable of crushing his heart, just\nas one might crush a flea. It must be the Almighty who gives him his\nstrength.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAs she returned to the kitchen she saw Abbe Mouret standing by the gate\nof the farmyard. Desiree had stopped him there to make him feel a capon\nwhich she had been fattening for some weeks past. He told her pleasantly\nthat it was very heavy, and the big child chuckled with glee.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! well,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said La Teuse in a fury, \u00e2\u0080\u0098that bird has got to crush its\nheart too. But then it can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help itself.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nAbbe Mouret spent his days at the parsonage. He shunned the long walks\nwhich he had been wont to take before his illness. The scorched soil of\nLes Artaud, the ardent heat of that valley where the vines could never\neven grow straight, distressed him. On two occasions, in the morning, he\nhad attempted to go out and read his breviary as he strolled along the\nroad; but he had not gone beyond the village. He had returned home,\novercome by the perfumes, the heat, the breadth of the landscape. It\nwas only in the evening, in the cool twilight air, that he ventured to\nsaunter a little in front of the church, on the terrace which led to\nthe graveyard. In the afternoons, to fill up his time, and satisfy his\ncraving for some kind of occupation, he had imposed upon himself the\ntask of pasting paper over the broken panes of the church windows, This\nhad kept him for a week mounted on a ladder, arranging his paper panes\nwith great exactness, and laying on the paste with the most scrupulous\ncare in order to avoid any mess.\n\nLa Teuse stood at the foot of the ladder and watched him. And Desiree\nurged that he must not fill up all the windows, or else the sparrows\nwould no longer be able to get through. To please her, the priest left\na pane or two in each window unfilled. Then, having completed these\nrepairs, he was seized with the ambition of decorating the church,\nwithout summoning to his aid either mason or carpenter or painter. He\nwould do it all himself. This sort of handiwork would amuse him, he\nsaid, and help to bring back his strength. Uncle Pascal encouraged him\nevery time he called at the parsonage, assuring him that such exercise\nand fatigue were better than all the drugs in the world. And so Abbe\nMouret began to stop up the holes in the walls with plaster, to drive\nfresh nails into the disjoined altars, and to crush and mix paints,\nin order that he might put a new coating on the pulpit and\nconfessional-box. It was quite an event in the district, and folks\ntalked of it for a couple of leagues round. Peasants would come and\nstand gazing, with their hands behind their backs, at his reverence\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nwork. The Abbe himself, with a blue apron tied round his waist, and his\nhands all soiled with his labour, became absorbed in it, and used it as\nan excuse for no longer going out. He spent his days in the midst of his\nrepairs, and was more tranquil than he had been before; almost cheerful,\nindeed, as he forgot the outer world, the trees and the sunshine and the\nwarm breezes, which had formerly disturbed him so much.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Monsieur le Cure is free to do as he pleases, since the parish hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\ngot to find the money,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said old Bambousse, who came round every evening\nto see how the work was progressing.\n\nAbbe Mouret spent all his savings on it. Some of his decorations,\nindeed, were so awkward that they would have excited many people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nsmiles. The replastering of the stonework soon tired him: so he\ncontented himself with patching up the church walls all round to a\nheight of some six feet from the ground. La Teuse mixed the plaster.\nWhen she talked of repairing the parsonage as well, for she was\ncontinually fearing that it would topple down on their heads, he told\nher that he did not think he could manage it, that a regular workman\nwould be necessary; a reply which led to a terrible quarrel between\nthem. La Teuse said it was quite ridiculous to go on ornamenting the\nchurch, where nobody slept, while their bedrooms were in such a crazy\ncondition, for she was quite sure they would all be found, one morning,\ncrushed to death by the fallen ceilings.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I shall end by bringing my bed here, and placing it behind the altar,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nshe grumbled. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I feel quite terrified sometimes at night.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHowever, when the plaster was all used up, she said no more about\nrepairing the parsonage. The painting which the priest executed quite\ndelighted her. It was the chief charm of the improvements. The Abbe,\nwho had repaired the woodwork everywhere with bits of boards, took\nparticular pleasure in spreading his big brush, dipped in bright yellow\npaint, over all this woodwork. The gentle, up-and-down motion of the\nbrush lulled him, left him thoughtless for hours whilst he gazed on the\noily streaks of paint. When everything was quite yellow, the pulpit,\nthe confessional-box, the altar rails, even the clock-case itself, he\nventured to try his hand at imitation marble work by way of touching up\nthe high altar. Then, growing bolder, he painted it all over. Glistening\nwith white and yellow and blue, it was pronounced superb. People who had\nnot been to mass for fifty years streamed into the church to see it.\n\nAnd now the paint was dry. All that remained for Abbe Mouret to do was\nto edge the panels with brown beading. So, that afternoon, he set to\nwork at it, wishing to get it done by evening; for on the following day,\nas he had reminded La Teuse, there would be high mass. She was there\nready to arrange the altar. She had already placed on the credence\nthe candlesticks and the silver cross, the porcelain vases filled with\nartificial roses, and the laced cloth which was only used on great\nfestivals. The beading, however, proved so difficult of execution, that\nit was not completed till late in the evening. It was growing quite dark\nas the Abbe finished his last panel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It will be really too beautiful,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said a rough voice from amidst the\ngreyish gloom of twilight which was filling the church.\n\nLa Teuse, who had knelt down to get a better view of the Abbe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brush as\nit glided along his rule, started with alarm.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Brother Archangias,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said, turning round. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You came in by\nthe sacristy then? You gave me quite a turn. Your voice seemed to sound\nfrom under the floor.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAbbe Mouret had resumed his work, after greeting the Brother with a\nslight nod. The Brother remained standing there in silence, with his fat\nhands clasped in front of his cassock. Then, shrugging his shoulders,\nas he observed with what scrupulous care the priest sought to make his\nbeading perfectly straight, he repeated:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It will be really too beautiful.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nLa Teuse, who knelt near by in ecstasy, started again.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Dear me!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I had quite forgotten you were there. You really\nought to cough before you speak. You have a voice that comes on one so\nsuddenly that one might think it was a voice from the grave.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe rose up and drew back a little the better to admire the Abbe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Why too beautiful?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she asked. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Nothing can be too beautiful when it is\ndone for the Almighty. If his reverence had only had some gold, he would\nhave done it with gold, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nWhen the priest had finished, she hastened to change the altar-cloth,\ntaking the greatest care not to smudge the beading. Then she arranged\nthe cross, the candlesticks, and the vases symmetrically. Abbe Mouret\nhad gone to lean against the wooden screen which separated the choir\nfrom the nave, by the side of Brother Archangias. Not a word passed\nbetween them. Their eyes were fixed upon the silver crucifix, which, in\nthe increasing gloom, still cast some glimmer of light on the feet and\nthe left side and the right temple of the big Christ. When La Teuse had\nfinished, she came down towards them, triumphantly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it look lovely?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she asked. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Just you see what a crowd there\nwill be at mass to-morrow! Those heathens will only come to God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house\nwhen they think He is well-to-do. Now, Monsieur le Cure, we must do as\nmuch for the Blessed Virgin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s altar.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Waste of money!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 growled Brother Archangias.\n\nBut La Teuse flew into a tantrum; and, as Abbe Mouret remained silent,\nshe led them both before the altar of the Virgin, pushing them and\ndragging them by their cassocks.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Just look at it,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said she; \u00e2\u0080\u0098it is too shabby for anything, now that\nthe high altar is so smart. It looks as though it had never been painted\nat all. However much I may rub it of a morning, the dust sticks to it.\nIt is quite black; it is filthy. Do you know what people will say about\nyou, your reverence? They will say that you care nothing for the Blessed\nVirgin; that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll say.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, what of it?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 queried Brother Archangias.\n\nLa Teuse looked at him, half suffocated by indignation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What of it? It would be sinful, of course,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she muttered. \u00e2\u0080\u0098This altar\nis like a neglected tomb in a graveyard. If it were not for me, the\nspiders would spin their webs across it, and moss would soon grow over\nit. From time to time, when I can spare a bunch of flowers, I give it to\nthe Virgin. All the flowers in our garden used to be for her once.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe had mounted the altar steps, and she took up two withered bunches of\nflowers, which had been left there, forgotten.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098See! it is just as it is in the graveyards,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said, throwing the\nflowers at Abbe Mouret\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feet.\n\nHe picked them up, without replying. It was quite dark now, and Brother\nArchangias stumbled about amongst the chairs and nearly fell. He growled\nand muttered some angry words, in which the names of Jesus and Mary\nrecurred. When La Teuse, who had gone for a lamp, returned into the\nchurch, she asked the priest:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098So I can put the brushes and pots away in the attic, then?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he answered. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I have finished. We will see about the rest later\non.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe walked away in front of them, carrying all the things with her, and\nkeeping silence, lest she should say too much. And as Abbe Mouret had\nkept the withered bunches of flowers in his hand, Brother Archangias\nsaid to him, as they passed the farmyard: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Throw those things away.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe Abbe took a few steps more, with downcast head; and then over the\npalings he flung the flowers upon a manure-heap.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nThe Brother, who had already had his own meal, seated himself astride a\nchair, while the priest dined. Since Serge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s return to Les Artaud, the\nBrother had thus spent most of his evenings at the parsonage; but never\nbefore had he imposed his presence upon the other in so rough a fashion.\nHe stamped on the tiled floor with his heavy boots, his voice thundered\nand he smote the furniture, whilst he related how he had whipped some of\nhis pupils that morning, or expounded his moral principles in terms\nas stern, as uncompromising as bludgeon-blows. Then feeling bored, he\nsuggested that he and La Teuse should have a game at cards. They had\nendless bouts of \u00e2\u0080\u0098Beggar-my-neighbour\u00e2\u0080\u0099 together, that being the only\ngame which La Teuse had ever been able to learn. Abbe Mouret would\nsmilingly glance at the first few cards flung on the table and would\nthen gradually sink into reverie, remaining for hours forgetful of his\nself-restraint, oblivious of his surroundings, beneath the suspicious\nglances of Brother Archangias.\n\nThat evening La Teuse felt so cross that she had talked of going to bed\nas soon as the cloth was removed. The Brother, however, wanted his\ngame of cards. So he caught hold of her shoulders and sat her down, so\nroughly that the chair creaked beneath her. And forthwith he began to\nshuffle the cards. Desiree, who hated him, had gone off carrying her\ndessert, which she generally took upstairs with her every evening to eat\nin bed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I want the red cards,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said La Teuse.\n\nThen the struggle began. The old woman at first won some of the\nBrother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best cards. But before long two aces fell together on the\ntable.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a battle!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she cried, wild with excitement.\n\nShe threw down a nine, which rather alarmed her, but as the Brother,\nin his turn, only put down a seven, she picked up the cards with a\ntriumphant air. At the end of half an hour, however, she had only gained\ntwo aces, so that the chances remained fairly equal. And a quarter of\nan hour later she lost an ace. The knaves and kings and queens were\nperpetually coming and going as the battle furiously progressed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a splendid game, eh?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Brother Archangias, turning towards\nAbbe Mouret.\n\nBut when he saw him sitting there, so absorbed in his reverie, with such\na gentle smile playing unconsciously round his lips, he roughly raised\nhis voice:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Why, Monsieur le Cure, you are not paying any attention to us! It isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\npolite of you. We are only playing on your account. We were trying\nto amuse you. Come and watch the game. It would do you more good than\ndozing and dreaming away there. Where were you just now?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe priest started. He said nothing, but with quivering eyelids tried to\nforce himself to look at the game. The play went on vigorously. La Teuse\nwon her ace back, and then lost it again. On some evenings they would\nfight in this way over the aces for quite four hours, and often they\nwould go off to bed, angry at having failed to bring the contest to a\ndecisive issue.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But, dear me! I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve only just remembered it!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 suddenly cried La Teuse,\nwho greatly feared that she was going to be beaten. \u00e2\u0080\u0098His reverence has\nto go out to-night. He promised Fortune and Rosalie that he would go to\nbless their room, according to the custom. Make haste, Monsieur le Cure!\nThe Brother will go with you.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAbbe Mouret had already risen from his chair, and was looking for\nhis hat. But Brother Archangias, still holding his cards, flew into a\ntantrum: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh! don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bother about it,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said he. \u00e2\u0080\u0098What does it want to\nbe blessed for that pigsty of theirs? It is a custom that you should do\naway with. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see any sense in it. Stay here and let us finish the\ngame. That is much the best thing to do.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the priest, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I promised to go. Those good people might feel\nhurt if I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. You stay here and play your game out while you are\nwaiting for me.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nLa Teuse glanced uneasily at Brother Archangias.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, yes, I will stay here,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cried the Brother. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It is really too\nabsurd.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut before Abbe Mouret could open the door, he flung his cards on the\ntable and rose to follow him. Then half turning back he called to La\nTeuse:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I should have won. Leave the cards as they are, and we will play the\ngame out to-morrow.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh! they are all mixed now,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 answered the old servant, who had lost no\ntime in shuffling them together. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Did you suppose that I was going to\nput your hand away under a glass case? And, besides, I might very well\nhave won, for I still had an ace left.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nA few strides brought Brother Archangias up with Abbe Mouret, who was\nwalking down the narrow path that led to the village. The Brother had\nundertaken the task of keeping watch over the Abbe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s movements. He\nincessantly played the spy upon him, accompanying him everywhere, or,\nif he could not go in person, sending some school urchin to follow\nhim. With that terrible laugh of his, he was wont to remark that he was\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gendarme.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAnd, in truth, the Abbe seemed like a culprit ever guarded by the black\nshadow of the Brother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cassock; a culprit to be treated distrustfully,\nsince in his weakness he might well lapse into fresh crime were he left\nfree from surveillance for a single moment. Thus he was watched and\nguarded with all the spiteful eagerness that some jealous old maid\nmight have displayed, the overreaching zeal of a gaoler who might carry\nprecautions so far as to exclude even such rays of light as might creep\nthrough the chinks of the prison-house. Brother Archangias was always on\nthe watch to keep out the sunlight, to prevent even a whiff of air from\nentering, to shut up his prison so completely that nothing from outside\ncould gain access to it. He noted the Abbe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s slightest fits of weakness,\nand by his glance divined his tender thoughts, which with a word he\npitilessly crushed, as though they were poisonous vermin. The priest\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nintervals of silence, his smiles, the paling of his brow, the faint\nquivering of his limbs, were all noted by the Brother. But he never\nspoke openly of the transgression. His presence alone was a sufficient\nreproach. The manner in which he uttered certain words imparted to them\nall the sting of a whip stroke. With a mere gesture he expressed his\nutter disgust for the priest\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sin. Like one of those betrayed husbands\nwho enjoy torturing their wives with cruel allusions, he contented\nhimself with recalling the scene at the Paradou, in an indirect fashion,\nby some word or phrase which sufficed to annihilate the Abbe, whenever\nthe latter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flesh rebelled.\n\nIt was nearly ten o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock and most of the villagers of Les Artaud had\nretired to rest. But from a brightly lighted house at the far end, near\nthe mill, there still came sounds of merriment. While keeping the best\nrooms for his own use, old Bambousse had given a corner of his house to\nhis daughter and son-in-law. They were all assembled there, drinking a\nlast glass, while waiting for the priest.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098They are drunk,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 growled Brother Archangias. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you hear the row\nthey are making?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAbbe Mouret made no reply. It was a lovely night and all looked bluish\nin the moonlight, which lent to the distant part of the valley the\naspect of a sleeping lake. The priest slackened his pace that he might\nthe more fully enjoy the charm of that soft radiance, and now and then\nhe even stopped as he came upon some expanse of light, experiencing the\ndelightful quiver which the proximity of fresh water brings one on a\nhot day. But the Brother continued striding along, grumbling and calling\nhim.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Come along; come along! It isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t good to loiter out of doors at this\ntime of night. You would be much better in bed.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAll at once, however, just as they were entering the village, Archangias\nhimself stopped short in the middle of the road. He was looking towards\nthe heights, where the white lines of the roads vanished amidst black\npatches of pine-woods, and he growled to himself, like a dog that scents\ndanger.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Who can be coming down so late?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he muttered.\n\nBut the priest, who neither saw nor heard anything, was now, in his\nturn, anxious to press on.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Stay! stay! there he is,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 eagerly added Brother Archangias. \u00e2\u0080\u0098He has\njust turned the corner. See! he is in the moonlight now. One can see him\nplainly. It is a tall man, with a stick.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen, after a moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s silence, he resumed, in a voice husky with fury:\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is he, that beggar! I felt sure it was!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThereupon, the new-comer having now reached the bottom of the hill, Abbe\nMouret saw that it was Jeanbernat. In spite of his eighty years, the old\nman set his feet down with such force, that his heavy, nailed boots\nsent sparks flying from the flints on the road. And he walked along as\nupright as an oak, without the aid of his stick, which he carried across\nhis shoulder like a musket.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! the villain!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 stammered the Brother, still standing motionless.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098May the fiend light all the blazes of hell under his feet!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe priest, who felt greatly disturbed, and despaired of inducing his\ncompanion to come on, turned round to continue his journey, hoping that,\nby a quick walk to the Bambousses\u00e2\u0080\u0099 house, he might yet manage to avoid\nJeanbernat. But he had not taken five strides before he heard the\nbantering voice of the old man close behind him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Hie! Cure! wait for me. Are you afraid of me?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAnd as Abbe Mouret stopped, he came up and continued: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! those\ncassocks of yours are tiresome things, aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t they? They prevent your\ngetting along too quickly. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s such a fine clear night, too, that one\ncan recognise you by your gown a long way off. When I was right at the\ntop of the hill, I said to myself, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSurely that is the little priest\ndown yonder.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Oh! yes, I still have very good eyes.... Well, so you\nnever come to see us now?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I have had so much to do,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 murmured the priest, who had turned very\npale.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, well, every one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s free to please himself. If I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve mentioned the\nmatter, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only because I want you to know that I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bear you any\ngrudge for being a priest. We wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even talk about your religion,\nit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all one and the same to me. But the little one thinks that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s I\nwho prevents your coming. I said to her, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe priest is an idiot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and\nI think so, indeed. Did I try to eat you during your illness? Why, I\ndidn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even go upstairs to see you. Every one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s free, you know.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe spoke on in the most unconcerned manner, pretending that he did not\nnotice the presence of Brother Archangias; but as the latter suddenly\nbroke into an angry grunt, he added, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Why, Cure, so you bring your pig\nout with you?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Take care, you bandit!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 hissed the Brother, clenching his fists.\n\nJeanbernat, whose stick was still raised, then pretended to recognise\nhim.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Hands off!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he cried. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s you, you soul-saver! I ought to have\nknown you by your smell. We have a little account to settle together,\nremember. I have sworn to cut off your ears in the middle of your\nschool. It will amuse the children you are poisoning.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe Brother fell back before the raised staff, a flood of abuse rising\nto his lips; but he began to stammer and went on disjointedly:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I will set the gendarmes after you, scoundrel! You spat on the church;\nI saw you. You give the plague to the poor people who merely pass your\ndoor. At Saint-Eutrope you made a girl die by forcing her to chew a\nconsecrated wafer which you had stolen. At Beage you went and dug up the\nbodies of little dead children and carried them away on your back. You\nare an old sorcerer! Everybody knows it, you scoundrel! You are the\ndisgrace of the district. Whoever strangles you will gain heaven for the\ndeed.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe old man listened with a sneer, twirling the while his staff between\nhis fingers. And between the Brother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s successive insults he ejaculated\nin an undertone:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Go on, go on; relieve yourself, you viper. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll break your back for you\nby-and-by.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAbbe Mouret tried to interfere, but Brother Archangias pushed him away,\nexclaiming: \u00e2\u0080\u0098You are led by him yourself! Didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t he make you trample\nupon the cross? Deny it, if you dare!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Then again, turning to\nJeanbernat, he yelled: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! Satan, you must have chuckled and no mistake\nwhen you held a priest in your grasp! May Heaven curse those who abetted\nyou in that sacrilege! What was it you did, at night, while he slept?\nYou came and moistened his tonsure with your saliva, eh? so that his\nhair might grow more quickly. And then you breathed upon his chin and\nhis cheeks that his beard might grow a hand\u00e2\u0080\u0099s breadth in a single night.\nAnd you rubbed all your philters into his body, and breathed into his\nmouth the lasciviousness of a dog. You turned him into a brute-beast,\nSatan.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s idiotic,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Jeanbernat, resting his stick on his shoulder. \u00e2\u0080\u0098He\nquite bores me.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe Brother, however, growing bolder, thrust his fists under the old\nman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nose.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And that drab of yours!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he cried, \u00e2\u0080\u0098you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deny that you set her on\nto damn the priest.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen he suddenly sprang backwards, with a shriek, for the old man,\nswinging his stick with all his strength, had just broken it over his\nback. Retreating yet a little further, Archangias picked from a heap of\nstones beside the road a piece of flint twice the size of a man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fist,\nand threw it at Jeanbernat. It would surely have split the other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nforehead open if he had not bent down. He, however, now likewise crossed\nover to a heap of stones, sheltered himself behind it, and provided\nhimself with missiles; and from one heap to the other a terrible combat\nbegan, with a perfect hail of flints. The moon now shone very brightly,\nand their dark shadows fell distinctly on the ground.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes, yes, you set that hussy on to ruin him!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 repeated the Brother,\nwild with rage. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! you are astonished that I know all about it! You\nhope for some monstrous result from it all. Every morning you make the\nthirteen signs of hell over that minx of yours! You would like her to\nbecome the mother of Antichrist. You long for Antichrist, you villain!\nBut may this stone blind you!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And may this one bung your mouth up!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 retorted Jeanbernat, who was\nnow quite calm again. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Is he cracked, the silly fellow, with all those\nstories of his?... Shall I have to break your head for you, before I can\nget on my way? Is it your catechism that has turned your brain?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Catechism, indeed! Do you know what catechism is taught to accursed\nones like you? Ah! I will show you how to make the sign of the\ncross.--This stone is for the Father, and this for the Son, and this\nfor the Holy Ghost. Ah! you are still standing. Wait a bit, wait a\nbit. Amen!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Then he threw a handful of small pebbles like a volley of\ngrape-shot. Jeanbernat, who was struck upon the shoulder, dropped the\nstones he was holding, and quietly stepped forwards, while Brother\nArchangias picked two fresh handfuls from the heap, blurting out:\n\nI am going to exterminate you. It is God who wills it. God is acting\nthrough my arm.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Will you be quiet!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the old man, grasping him by the nape of the\nneck.\n\nThen came a short struggle amidst the dust of the road, all bluish with\nmoonlight. The Brother, finding himself the weaker of the two, tried\nto bite. But Jeanbernat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sinewy limbs were like coils of rope which\npinioned him so tightly that he could almost feel them cutting into\nhis flesh. He panted and ceased to struggle, meditating some act of\ntreachery.\n\nThe old man, having got the other under him, scoffingly exclaimed: \u00e2\u0080\u0098I\nhave a good mind to break one of your arms. You see that it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you\nwho are the stronger, but that it is I who am exterminating you.... Now\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to cut your ears off. You have tried my endurance too far.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nJeanbernat calmly drew his knife from his pocket. But Abbe Mouret, who\nhad several times attempted to part the combatants, now raised such\nstrenuous opposition to the old man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s design that he consented to defer\nthe operation till another time.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You are acting foolishly, Cure,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said he. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It would do this scoundrel\ngood to be well bled; but, since it seems to displease you, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll wait a\nlittle longer; I shall be meeting him again in some quiet corner.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAnd as the Brother broke out into a growl, Jeanbernat cried\nthreateningly: \u00e2\u0080\u0098If you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t keep still I will cut your ears off at\nonce!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But you are sitting on his chest,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the priest, \u00e2\u0080\u0098get up and let him\nbreathe.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No, no; he would begin his tomfoolery again. I will give him his\nliberty when I go away, but not before.... Well, I was telling you,\nCure, when this good-for-nothing interrupted us, that you would be very\nwelcome yonder. The little one is mistress, you know; I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t attempt\nto interfere with her any more than I do with my salad-plants. There are\nonly fools like this croaker here who see any harm in it. Where did you\nsee anything wrong, scoundrel? It was yourself who imagined it, villain\nthat you are!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAnd thereupon he gave the Brother another shaking. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Let him get up,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nbegged Abbe Mouret.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098By-and-by. The little one has not been well for a long time. I did not\nnotice anything myself, but she told me; and now I am on my way to tell\nyour uncle Pascal, at Plassans. I like the night for walking; it is\nquiet, and, as a rule, one isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t delayed by meeting people.... Yes, yes,\nthe little one is quite ailing.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe priest could not find a word to say. He staggered, and his head\nsank.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It made her so happy to look after you,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 continued the old man. \u00e2\u0080\u0098While\nI smoked my pipe I used to hear her laugh. That was quite sufficient for\nme. Girls are like the hawthorns; when they break out into blossom, they\ndo all they can. Well, now, you will come, if your heart prompts you to\nit. I am sure it would please the little one. Good night, Cure.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe got up slowly, keeping a firm grasp of the Brother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wrists, to\nguard against any treacherous attack. Then he proceeded on his way, with\nswinging strides, without once turning his head. The Brother silently\ncrept to the heap of stones, and waited till the old man was some\ndistance off. Then, with both hands, and with mad violence, he again\nbegan flinging stones, but they fell harmlessly upon the dusty road.\nJeanbernat did not condescend to notice them, but went his way, upright\nlike a tree, through the clear night.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The accursed one!--Satan carries him on!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 shrieked Brother Archangias,\nas he hurled his last stone. \u00e2\u0080\u0098An old scoundrel, that the least touch\nought to upset! But he is baked in hell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fire. I smelt his claws.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe Brother stamped with impotent rage on the scattered flints. Then he\nsuddenly attacked Abbe Mouret. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It was all your fault,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he cried; \u00e2\u0080\u0098you\nought to have helped me, and, between us, we could have strangled him.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nMeantime, at the other end of the village, the uproar in the Bambousses\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nhouse had become greater than ever. The rhythmic tapping of glasses on\na table could be distinctly heard. The priest resumed his walk without\nraising his head, making his way towards the flood of bright light that\nstreamed out of the window like the flare of a fire of vine-cuttings.\nThe Brother followed him gloomily; his cassock soiled with dust, and one\nof his cheeks bleeding from a stone-cut. And, after a short interval of\nsilence, he asked, in his harsh voice: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Shall you go?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen as Abbe Mouret did not answer, he went on: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Take care! You are\nlapsing into sin again. It was sufficient for that man to pass by to\nsend a thrill through your whole body. I saw you by the light of the\nmoon looking as pale as a girl. Take care! take care! Do you hear me?\nAnother time God will not pardon you--you will sink into the lowest\nabyss! Ah! wretched piece of clay that you are, filth is mastering you!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThereupon, the priest at last raised his head. Big tears were streaming\nfrom his eyes, and it was in gentle heartbroken accents that he spoke:\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Why do you speak to me like that?--You are always with me, and you know\nmy ceaseless struggles. Do not doubt me, leave me strength to master\nmyself.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThose simple words, bathed with silent tears, fell on the night air\nwith such an expression of superhuman suffering, that even Brother\nArchangias, in spite of all his harshness, felt touched. He made no\nreply, but shook his dusty cassock, and wiped his bleeding cheek. When\nthey reached the Bambousses\u00e2\u0080\u0099 house, he refused to go inside. He seated\nhimself, a few yards away, on the body of an overturned cart, where he\nwaited for the Abbe with dog-like patience.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! here is Monsieur le Cure!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cried all the company of Bambousses and\nBrichets as Serge entered.\n\nThey filled their glasses once more. Abbe Mouret was compelled to take\none, too. There had been no regular wedding-feast; but, in the evening,\nafter dinner, a ten-gallon \u00e2\u0080\u0098Dame Jane\u00e2\u0080\u0099 had been placed upon the table,\nand they were making it their business to empty it before going to bed.\nThere were ten of them, and old Bambousse was already with one hand\ntilting over the jar whence only a thread of red liquor now flowed.\nRosalie, in a very sportive frame of mind, was dipping her baby\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chin\ninto her glass, while big Fortune showed off his strength by lifting\nup the chairs with his teeth. All the company passed into the bedroom.\nCustom required that the priest should there drink the glass of wine\nwhich had been poured out for him. It brought good luck, and prevented\nquarrels in the household. In Monsieur Caffin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time, it had always\nbeen a very merry ceremony, for the old priest loved a joke. He had\neven gained a reputation for the skilful way in which he could drain his\nglass, without leaving a single drop at the bottom of it; and the Artaud\nwomen pretended that every drop undrunk meant a year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s less love for the\nnewly married pair. But with Abbe Mouret they dare not joke so freely.\nHowever, he drank his wine at one gulp, which seemed to greatly please\nold Bambousse. Mother Brichet looked at the bottom of the glass and\nsaw but a drop or two of the liquid remaining there. Then, after a few\njokes, they all returned to the living room, where Vincent and Catherine\nhad remained by themselves. Vincent, standing upon a chair, was clasping\nthe huge jar in his arms, and draining the last drops of wine into\nCatherine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s open mouth.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098We are much obliged to you, Monsieur le Cure,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said old Bambousse, as\nhe escorted the priest to the door. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re married now, so I\nsuppose you are satisfied. And they are not likely to complain, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m\nsure.... Good night, sleep well, your reverence.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBrother Archangias had slowly risen from his seat on the old cart.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098May the devil pile hot coals over them, and roast them!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he murmured.\n\nThen without again opening his lips he accompanied Abbe Mouret to the\nparsonage. And he waited outside till the door was closed. Even then he\ndid not go off without twice looking round to make sure that the\nAbbe was not coming out again. As for the priest, when he reached his\nbedroom, he threw himself in his clothes upon his bed, clasping his\nhands to his ears, and pressing his face to the pillow, in order that he\nmight shut out all sound and sight. And thus stilling his senses he fell\ninto death-like slumber.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\nThe next day was Sunday. As the Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy\nCross fell on a high mass day, Abbe Mouret desired to celebrate the\nfestival with especial solemnity. He was now full of extraordinary\ndevotion for the Cross, and had replaced the image of the Immaculate\nConception in his bedroom by a large crucifix of black wood, before\nwhich he spent long hours in worship. To exalt the Cross, to plant it\nbefore him, above all else, in a halo of glory, as the one object of\nhis life, gave him the strength he needed to suffer and to struggle. He\nsometimes dreamed of hanging there himself, in Jesus\u00e2\u0080\u0099s place, his head\ncrowned with thorns, nails driven through his hands and feet, and\nhis side rent by spears. What a coward he must be to complain of an\nimaginary wound, when God bled there from His whole body, and yet\npreserved on His lips the blessed smile of the Redemption! And however\nunworthy it might be, he offered up his wound as a sacrifice, ended by\nfalling into ecstasy, and believing that blood did really stream from\nhis brow and side and limbs. Those were hours of relief, for he fancied\nthat all the impurity within him flowed forth from his wounds. And he\nthen usually drew himself up with the heroism of a martyr, and longed to\nbe called upon to suffer the most frightful tortures, in order that he\nmight bear them without a quiver of the flesh.\n\nAt early dawn that day he knelt before the crucifix, and grace came upon\nhim abundantly as dew. He made no effort, he simply fell upon his knees,\nto receive it in his heart, to be permeated with it to the marrow of his\nbones in sweetest and most refreshing fulness. On the previous day he\nhad prayed for grace in agony, and it had not come. At times it long\nremained deaf to his entreaties, and then, when he simply clasped his\nhands, in quite childlike fashion, it flowed down to succour him.\nIt came upon him that morning like a benediction, bringing perfect\nserenity, absolute trusting faith. He forgot his anguish of the previous\ndays, and surrendered himself wholly to the triumphant joy of the Cross.\nHe seemed to be cased in such impenetrable armour that the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most\ndeadly blows would glide off from it harmlessly. When he came down from\nhis bedroom, he stepped along with an air of serenity and victory. La\nTeuse was astonished, and went to find Desiree, that he might kiss her;\nand both of them clapped their hands, and said that they had not seen\nhim looking so well for the last six months.\n\nBut it was in the church, at high mass, that the priest felt that he\nhad really recovered divine grace. It was a long time since he had\napproached the altar with such loving emotion; and he had to make a\ngreat effort to restrain himself from weeping whilst he remained with\nhis lips pressed to the altar-cloth. It was a solemn high mass. The\nlocal rural guard, an uncle of Rosalie, chanted in a deep bass voice\nwhich rumbled through the low nave like a hoarse organ. Vincent, robed\nin a surplice much too large for him, which had formerly belonged to\nAbbe Caffin, carried an old silver censer, and was vastly amused by the\ntinkling of its chains; he swung it to a great height, so as to produce\ncopious clouds of smoke, and glanced behind him every now and then to\nsee if he had succeeded in making any one cough. The church was almost\nfull, for everybody wanted to see his reverence\u00e2\u0080\u0099s painting. Peasant\nwomen laughed with pleasure because the place smelt so nice, while the\nmen, standing under the gallery, jerked their heads approvingly at each\ndeeper and deeper note that came from the rural guard. Filtering through\nthe paper window panes the full morning sun lighted up the brightly\npainted walls, on which the women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s caps cast shadows resembling huge\nbutterflies. The artificial flowers, with which the altar was decorated,\nalmost seemed to possess the moist freshness of natural ones newly\ngathered; and when the priest turned round to bless the congregation, he\nfelt even stronger emotion than before, as he saw his church so clean,\nso full, and so steeped in music and incense and light.\n\nAfter the offertory, however, a buzzing murmur sped through the peasant\nwomen. Vincent inquisitively turned his head, and in doing so, almost\nlet the charcoal in his censer fall upon the priest\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chasuble. And,\nwishing to excuse himself, as he saw the Abbe looking at him with an\nexpression of reproof, he murmured: \u00e2\u0080\u0098It is your reverence\u00e2\u0080\u0099s uncle, who\nhas just come in.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAt the end of the church, standing beside one of the slender wooden\npillars that supported the gallery, Abbe Mouret then perceived Doctor\nPascal. The doctor was not wearing his usual cheerful and slightly\nscoffing expression. Hat in hand, he stood there looking very grave, and\nfollowed the service with evident impatience. The sight of the priest\nat the altar, his solemn demeanour, his slow gestures, and the perfect\nserenity of his countenance, appeared to gradually increase his\nirritation. He could not stay there till the end of the mass, but left\nthe church, and walked up and down beside his horse and gig, which he\nhad secured to one of the parsonage shutters.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Will that nephew of mine never have finished censing himself?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he asked\nof La Teuse, who was just coming out of the vestry.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is all over,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she replied. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you come into the drawing-room?\nHis reverence is unrobing. He knows you are here.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, unless he were blind, he couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t very well help it,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 growled the\ndoctor, as he followed La Teuse into the cold-looking, stiffly furnished\nchamber, which she pompously called the drawing-room. Here for a few\nminutes he paced up and down. The gloomy coldness of his surroundings\nseemed to increase his irritation. As he strode about, flourishing\na stick he carried, he kept on striking the well-worn chair-seats of\nhorsehair which sounded hard and dead as stone. Then, tired of walking,\nhe took his stand in front of the mantelpiece, in the centre of which a\ngaudily painted image of Saint Joseph occupied the place of a clock.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! here he comes at last,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said, as he heard the door opening.\nAnd stepping towards the Abbe he went on: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Do you know that you made me\nlisten to half a mass? It is a very long time since that happened to me.\nBut I was bent on seeing you to-day. I have something to say to you.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen he stopped, and looked at the priest with an expression of\nsurprise. Silence fell. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You at all events are quite well,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he resumed,\nin a different voice.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes, I am very much better than I was,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied Abbe Mouret, with a\nsmile. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I did not expect you before Thursday. Sunday isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t your day for\ncoming. Is there something you want to tell me?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nUncle Pascal did not give an immediate answer. He went on looking at the\nAbbe. The latter was still fresh from the influence of the church and\nthe mass. His hair was fragrant with the perfume of the incense, and in\nhis eyes shone all the joy of the Cross. His uncle jogged his head, as\nhe noticed that expression of triumphant peace.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I have come from the Paradou,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said, abruptly. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Jeanbernat came to\nfetch me there. I have seen Albine, and she disquiets me. She needs much\ncareful treatment.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe kept his eyes fixed upon the priest as he spoke, but he did not\ndetect so much as a quiver of Serge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyelids.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098She took great care of you, you know,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he added, more roughly. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Without\nher, my boy, you might now be in one of the cells at Les Tulettes, with\na strait waistcoat on.... Well, I promised that you would go to see her.\nI will take you with me. It will be a farewell meeting. She is anxious\nto go away.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I can do nothing more than pray for the person of whom you speak,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said\nAbbe Mouret, softly.\n\nAnd as the doctor, losing his temper, brought his stick down heavily\nupon the couch, he added calmly, but in a firm voice:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am a priest, and can only help with prayers.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah, well! Yes, you are right,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Uncle Pascal, dropping down into\nan armchair, \u00e2\u0080\u0098it is I who am an old fool. Yes, I wept like a child, as\nI came here alone in my gig. That is what comes of living amongst books.\nOne learns a lot from them, but one makes a fool of oneself in the\nworld. How could I guess that it would all turn out so badly?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe rose from his chair and began to walk about again, looking\nexceedingly troubled.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But yes, but yes, I ought to have guessed. It was all quite natural.\nThough with one in your position, it was bound to be abominable! You\nare not as other men. But listen to me, I assure you that otherwise you\nwould never have recovered. It was she alone, with the atmosphere she\nset round you, who saved you from madness. There is no need for me to\ntell you what a state you were in. It is one of my most wonderful cures.\nBut I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take any pride, any pleasure in it, for now the poor girl is\ndying of it!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAbbe Mouret remained there erect, perfectly calm, his face reflecting\nall the quiet serenity of a martyr whom nothing that man might do could\ndisturb.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098God will take mercy upon her,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098God! God!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 muttered the doctor below his breath. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! He would do\nbetter not to interfere. We might manage matters if we were left\nto ourselves.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Then, raising his voice, he added: \u00e2\u0080\u0098I thought I had\nconsidered everything carefully, that is the most wonderful part of it.\nOh! what a fool I was! You would stay there, I thought, for a month to\nrecover your strength. The shade of the trees, the cheerful chatter of\nthe girl, all the youthfulness about you would quickly bring you round.\nAnd then you, on your side, it seemed to me, would do something to\nreclaim the poor child from her wild ways; you would civilise her, and,\nbetween us, we should turn her into a young lady, for whom we should,\nby-and-by, find a suitable husband. It seemed such a perfect scheme. And\nthen how was I to guess that old philosophising Jeanbernat would never\nstir an inch from his lettuce-beds? Well! well! I myself never left\nmy own laboratory. I had such pressing work there.... And it is all my\nfault! Ah! I am a stupid bungler!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe was choking, and wished to go off. And he began to look about him for\nhis hat, though, all the while, he had it on his head.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Good-bye!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he stammered; \u00e2\u0080\u0098I am going. So you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come? Do, now--for\nmy sake! You see how miserable, how upset I am. I swear to you that she\nshall go away immediately afterwards. That is all settled. My gig is\nhere; you might be back in an hour. Come, do come, I beg you.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe priest made a sweeping gesture; such a gesture as the doctor had\nseen him make before the altar.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I cannot.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen, as he accompanied his uncle out of the room, he added:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Tell her to fall on her knees and pray to God. God will hear her as He\nheard me, and He will comfort her as He has comforted me. There is no\nother means of salvation.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe doctor looked him full in the face, and shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Good-bye, then,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he repeated. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You are quite well now, and have no\nfurther need of me.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut, as he was unfastening his horse, Desiree, who had heard his voice,\ncame running up. She was extremely attached to her uncle. When she had\nbeen younger he had been wont to listen to her childish prattle for\nhours without showing the least sign of weariness. And, even now, he\ndid his best to spoil her, and manifested the greatest interest in her\nfarmyard, often spending a whole afternoon with her amongst her fowls\nand ducks, and smiling at her with his bright eyes. He seemed to\nconsider her superior to other girls. And so she now flung herself round\nhis neck, in an impulse of affection, and cried:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you going to stay and have some lunch with us?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut having kissed her, he said he could not remain, and unfastened her\narms from his neck with a somewhat pettish air. She laughed however, and\nagain clasped her arms round him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh! but you must,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she persisted. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I have some eggs that have only just\nbeen laid. I have been looking in the nests, and there are fourteen eggs\nthis morning. And, if you will stay, we can have a fowl, the white\none, that is always quarrelling with the others. When you were here on\nThursday, you know, it pecked the big spotted hen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eye out.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut her uncle persisted in his refusal. He was irritated to find that he\ncould not unfasten the knot in which he had tied his reins. And then she\nbegan to skip round him, clapping her hands and repeating in a sing-song\nvoice: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes! yes! you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll stay, and we will eat it up, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll eat it up!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHer uncle could no longer resist her blandishments; he raised his head\nand smiled at her. She seemed so full of life and health and sincerity;\nher gaiety was as frank and natural as the sheet of sunlight which was\ngilding her bare arms.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You big silly!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said; and clasping her by the wrists as she\ncontinued skipping gleefully about him, he went on: \u00e2\u0080\u0098No, dear; not\nto-day. I have to go to see a poor girl who is ill. But I will come some\nother morning. I promise you faithfully.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098When? when?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she persisted. \u00e2\u0080\u0098On Thursday? The cow is in calf, you know,\nand she hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seemed at all well these last two days. You are a doctor,\nand you ought to be able to give her something to do her good.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAbbe Mouret, who had calmly remained there, could not restrain a slight\nlaugh.\n\nThe doctor gaily got into his gig and exclaimed: \u00e2\u0080\u0098All right, my dear,\nI will attend to your cow. Come and let me kiss you. Ah! how nice\nand healthy you are! And you are worth more than all the others put\ntogether. Ah! if every one was like my big silly, this earth would be\ntoo beautiful!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe set his horse off with a cluck of his tongue, and continued talking\nto himself as the gig rattled down the hill.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes, yes! there should be nothing but animals. Ah! if they were mere\nanimals, how happy and gay and strong they would all be! It has gone\nwell with the girl, who is as happy as her cow; but it has gone badly\nwith the lad, who is in torture beneath his cassock. A drop too much\nblood, a little too much nerve, and one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s whole life is wrecked! ...\nThey are true Rougons and true Macquarts those children there! The\ntail-end of the stock--its final degeneracy.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen, urging on his horse, he drove at a trot up the hill that led to\nthe Paradou.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\nSunday was a busy day for Abbe Mouret. He had to think of vespers, which\nhe generally said to empty seats, for even mother Brichet did not carry\nher piety so far as to go back to church in the afternoon. Then, at four\no\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, Brother Archangias brought the little rogues from his school\nto repeat their catechism to his reverence. This lesson sometimes lasted\nuntil late. When the children showed themselves quite intractable, La\nTeuse was summoned to frighten them with her broom.\n\nOn that particular Sunday, about four o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, Desiree found herself\nquite alone in the parsonage. As she felt a little bored, she went to\ngather some food for her rabbits in the churchyard, where there were\nsome magnificent poppies, of which rabbits are extremely fond. Dragging\nherself about on her knees between the grave-stones, she gathered\napronfuls of juicy verdure on which her pets fell greedily.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh! what lovely plantains!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she muttered, stooping before Abbe Caffin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ntombstone, and delighted with the discovery she had made.\n\nThere were, indeed, some magnificent plantains spreading out their broad\nleaves beside the stone. Desiree had just finished filling her apron\nwith them when she fancied she heard a strange noise behind her. A\nrustling of branches and a rolling of small pebbles came from the ravine\nwhich skirted one side of the graveyard, and at the bottom of which\nflowed the Mascle, a stream which descended from the high lands of\nthe Paradou. But the ascent here was so rough, so impracticable, that\nDesiree imagined that the noise could only have been made by some lost\ndog or straying goat. She stepped quickly to the edge, and, as she\nlooked over, she was amazed to see amidst the brambles a girl who was\nclimbing up the rocks with extraordinary agility.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I will give you a hand,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You might easily break your neck\nthere.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe girl, directly she saw she was discovered, started back, as though\nshe would rather go down again, but after a moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hesitation she\nventured to take the hand that was held out to her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh! I know who you are,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Desiree, with a beaming smile, and\nletting her apron fall that she might grasp the girl by the waist. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You\nonce gave me some blackbirds, but they all died, poor little dears. I\nwas so sorry about it.--Wait a bit, I know your name, I have heard it\nbefore. La Teuse often mentions it when Serge isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t there; but she\ntold me that I was not to repeat it. Wait a moment, I shall remember it\ndirectly!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe tried to recall the name, and grew quite grave in the attempt. Then,\nhaving succeeded in remembering it, she became gay again, and seemingly\nfound great pleasure in dwelling upon its musical sound.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Albine! Albine!---- What a sweet name it is! At first I used to think\nyou must be a tomtit, because I once had a tomtit with a name very like\nyours, though I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remember exactly what it was.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAlbine did not smile. Her face was very pale, and there was a feverish\ngleam in her eyes. A few drops of blood trickled from her hands. When\nshe had recovered her breath, she hastily exclaimed:\n\nNo! no! leave it alone. You will only stain your handkerchief. It is\nnothing but a scratch. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to come by the road, as I should\nhave been seen--so I preferred coming along the bed of the torrent----\nIs Serge there?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nDesiree did not feel at all shocked at hearing the girl pronounce\nher brother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name thus familiarly and with an expression of subdued\npassion. She simply replied that he was in the church hearing the\nchildren say their catechism.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You must not speak at all loudly,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she added, raising her finger to\nher lips. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Serge forbade me to talk loudly when he is catechising the\nchildren, and we shall get into trouble if we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t keep quiet. Let us\ngo into the stable--shall we? We can talk better there.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I want to see Serge,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Albine, simply.\n\nDesiree cast a hasty glance at the church, and then whispered, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes,\nyes; Serge will be finely caught. Come with me. We will hide ourselves,\nand keep quite quiet. We shall have some fine fun!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe had picked up the herbage which had fallen from her apron, and\nquitting the graveyard she stole back to the parsonage, telling Albine\nto hide herself behind her and make herself as little as possible. As\nthey stealthily glided through the farmyard, they caught sight of La\nTeuse, who was crossing over to the vestry, but she did not appear to\nnotice them.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There! There!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Desiree, quite delighted, as they stowed themselves\naway in the stable; \u00e2\u0080\u0098keep quiet, and no one will know that we are here.\nThere is some straw there for you to lie down upon.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAlbine seated herself on a truss of straw.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And Serge?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she asked, persisting in her one fixed idea.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Listen! You can hear his voice. When he claps his hands, it will be all\nover, and the children will go away--Listen! he is telling them a tale.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThey could indeed just hear Abbe Mouret\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice, which was wafted to\nthem through the vestry doorway which La Teuse had doubtless left open.\nIt came to them like a solemn murmur, in which they could distinguish\nthe name of Jesus thrice repeated. Albine trembled. She sprang up as\nthough to hasten to that beloved voice whose caressing accents she knew\nso well, but all sound of it suddenly died away, shut off by the\nclosing of the door. Then she sat down again, to wait, her hands tightly\nclasped, and her clear eyes gleaming with the intensity of her thoughts.\nDesiree, who was lying at her feet, gazed up at her with innocent\nadmiration.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098How beautiful you are!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she whispered. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You are like an image that\nSerge used to have in his bedroom. It was quite white like you are, with\ngreat curls floating about the neck; and the heart was quite bare and\nuncovered, just in the place where I can feel yours beating---- But\nyou are not listening to me. You are looking quite sad. Let us play at\nsomething? Will you?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen she stopped short, holding her breath and saying between her teeth:\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! the wretches! they will get us caught!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 She still had her apron\nfull of herbage with her, and her pets were taking it by assault. A\ntroop of fowls had surrounded her, clucking and calling each other, and\npecking at the hanging green stuff. The goat pushed its head slyly under\nher arm, and began to eat the longer leaves. Even the cow, which was\ntethered to the wall, strained at its cord and poked out its nose,\nkissing her with its warm breath.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh! you thieves!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cried Desiree. \u00e2\u0080\u0098But this is for the rabbits, not for\nyou! Leave me alone, won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you! You, there, will get your ears boxed, if\nyou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go away! And you too will have your tail pulled if I catch you\nat it again. The wretches! they will be eating my hands soon!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe drove the goat off, dispersed the fowls with her feet, and tapped\nthe cow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nose with her fists. But the creatures just shook themselves,\nand then came back more greedily than ever, surrounding her, jumping\non her, and tearing open her apron. At this she whispered to Albine, as\nthough she were afraid the animals might hear her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t they amusing, the dears? Watch them eat.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAlbine looked on with a grave expression.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Now, now, be good,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 resumed Desiree; \u00e2\u0080\u0098you shall all have some, but you\nmust wait your turns. Now, big Lisa, you first. Eh! how fond you are of\nplantain, aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBig Lisa was the cow. She slowly munched a handful of the juicy leaves\nwhich had grown beside Abbe Caffin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tomb. A thread of saliva hung down\nfrom her mouth, and her great brown eyes shone with quiet enjoyment.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There! now it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your turn,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 continued Desiree, turning towards the\ngoat. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You are fond of poppies, I know; and you like the flowers best,\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you? The buds that shine in your teeth like red-hot butterflies!\nSee, here are some splendid ones; they came from the left-hand corner,\nwhere there was a burial last year.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAs she spoke, she gave the goat a bunch of scarlet flowers, which the\nanimal ate from her hand. When there was nothing left in her grasp\nbut the stalks, she pushed these between its teeth. Behind her, in the\nmeanwhile, the fowls were desperately pecking away at her petticoats.\nShe threw them some wild chicory and dandelions which she had gathered\namongst the old slabs that were ranged alongside the church walls.\nIt was particularly over the dandelions that the fowls quarrelled, so\nvoraciously indeed, with such scratchings and flapping of wings,\nthat the other fowls in the yard heard them. And then came a general\ninvasion. The big yellow cock, Alexander, was the first to appear;\nhaving seized a dandelion and torn it in halves, without attempting to\neat it, he called to the hens who were still outside to come and peck.\nThen a white hen strutted in, then a black one, and then a whole crowd\nof hens, who hustled one another, and trod on one another\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tails, and\nended by forming a wild flood of feathers. Behind the fowls came the\npigeons, and the ducks, and the geese, and, last of all, the turkeys.\nDesiree laughed at seeing herself thus surrounded by this noisy,\nsquabbling mob.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098This is what always happens,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said she, \u00e2\u0080\u0098every time that I bring any\ngreen stuff from the graveyard. They nearly kill each other to get at\nit; they must find it very nice.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen she made a fight to keep a few handfuls of the leaves from the\ngreedy beaks which rose all round her, saying that something must really\nbe saved for the rabbits. She would surely get angry with them if\nthey went on like that, and give them nothing but dry bread in future.\nHowever, she was obliged to give way. The geese tugged at her apron\nso violently that she was almost pulled down upon her knees; the ducks\ngobbled away at her ankles; two of the pigeons flew upon her head, and\nsome of the fowls fluttered about her shoulders. It was the ferocity of\ncreatures who smell flesh: the fat plantains, the crimson poppies,\nthe milky dandelions, in which remained some of the life of the dead.\nDesiree laughed loudly, and felt that she was on the point of slipping\ndown, and letting go of her last two handfuls, when the fowls were\npanic-stricken by a terrible grunting.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s you, my fatty,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she exclaimed, quite delighted; \u00e2\u0080\u0098eat them up,\nand set me at liberty.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe pig waddled in; he was no longer the little pig of former days--pink\nas a newly painted toy, with a tiny little tail, like a bit of string;\nbut a fat wobbling creature, fit to be killed, with a belly as round\nas a monk\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, and a back all bristling with rough hairs, that reeked of\nfatness. His stomach had grown quite yellow from his habit of sleeping\non the manure heap. Waddling along on his shaky feet, he charged with\nlowered snout at the scared fowls, and so left Desiree at liberty to\nescape, and take the rabbits the few scraps of green stuff which she had\nso strenuously defended. When she came back, all was peace again. The\nstupid, ecstatic-looking geese were lazily swaying their long necks\nabout, the ducks and turkeys were waddling in ungainly fashion alongside\nthe wall; the fowls were quietly clucking and peaking at invisible\ngrains on the hard ground of the stable; while the pig, the goat, and\nthe big cow, were drowsily blinking their eyes, as though they were\nfalling asleep. Outside it had just begun to rain.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! well, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a shower coming on!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cried Desiree, throwing herself\ndown on the straw. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You had better stay where you are, my dears, if you\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to get soaked.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen she turned to Albine and added: \u00e2\u0080\u0098How stupid they all look, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nthey? They only wake up just to eat!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAlbine still remained silent. The merry laughter of that buxom girl\nas she struggled amidst those greedy necks and gluttonous beaks, which\ntickled and kissed her, and seemed bent on devouring her very flesh, had\nrendered the unhappy daughter of the Paradou yet paler than she had been\nbefore. So much gaiety, so much vitality, so much boisterous health made\nher despair. She strained her feverish arms to her desolate bosom, which\ndesertion had parched.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And Serge?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she asked again, in the same clear, stubborn voice.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Hush!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Desiree. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I heard him just now. He hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t finished yet----\nWe have been making a pretty disturbance; La Teuse must surely have\ngrown deaf this afternoon---- Let us keep quiet now. I like to hear the\nrain fall.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe shower beat in at the open doorway, casting big drops upon the\nthreshold. The restless fowls, after venturing out for a moment, had\nquickly retreated to the far end of the stable; where, indeed, with the\nexception of three ducks who remained quietly walking in the rain, all\nthe pets had now taken refuge, clustering round the girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s skirts. It\nwas growing very warm amongst the straw. Desiree pulled two big trusses\ntogether, made a bed of them, and lay down at full length. She felt\nextremely comfortable there.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is so nice,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she murmured. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Come and lie down like me. It is so\nspringy and soft, all this straw; and it tickles one so funnily in the\nneck. Do you roll about in the straw at home? There is nothing I am\nfonder of---- Sometimes I tickle the soles of my feet with it. That is\nvery funny, too----\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut at that moment, the big yellow cock, who had been gravely stalking\ntowards her, jumped upon her breast.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Get away with you, Alexander! get away!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she cried. \u00e2\u0080\u0098What a tiresome\ncreature he is! The idea of his perching himself on me---- You are too\nrough, sir, and you scratch me with your claws. Do you hear me? I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nwant you to go away, but you must be good, and mustn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t peck at my hair.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen she troubled herself no further about him. The cock still\nmaintained his position, every now and then glancing inquisitively at\nthe girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chin with his gleaming eye. The other birds all began to\ncluster round her. After rolling amongst the straw, she was now lying\nlazily on her back with her arms stretched out.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! how pleasant it is,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said; \u00e2\u0080\u0098but then it makes me feel so\nsleepy. Straw always makes one drowsy, doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it? Serge doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like\nit. Perhaps you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t either. What do you like? Tell me, so that I may\nknow.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe was gradually dozing off. For a moment she opened her eyes widely,\nas though she were looking for something, and then her eyelids fell with\na tranquil smile of content. She seemed to be asleep, but after a few\nminutes she opened her eyes again, and said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The cow is going to have a calf---- That will be so nice, and will\nplease me more than anything.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen she sank into deep slumber. The fowls had ended by perching on\nher body; she was buried beneath a wave of living plumage. Hens were\nbrooding over her feet; geese stretched their soft downy necks over her\nlegs. The pig lay against her left side, while on the right, the goat\npoked its bearded head under her arm. The pigeons were roosting and\nnestling all over her, on her hands, her waist, and her shoulders. And\nthere she lay asleep, in all her rosy freshness, caressed by the cow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nwarm breath, while the big cock still squatted just below her bosom with\ngleaming comb and quivering wings.\n\nOutside, the rain was falling less heavily. A sunbeam, escaping from\nbeneath a cloud, gilded the fine drops of water. Albine, who had\nremained perfectly still, watched the slumber of Desiree, that big,\nplump girl who found her great delight in rolling about in the straw.\nShe wished that she, too, could slumber away so peacefully, and feel\nsuch pleasure, because a few straws had tickled her neck. And she felt\njealous of those strong arms, that firm bosom, all that vitality, all\nthat purely animal development which made the other like a tranquil\neasy-minded sister of the big red and white cow.\n\nHowever, the rain had now quite ceased. The three cats of the parsonage\nfiled out into the yard one after the other, keeping close to the wall,\nand taking the greatest precautions to avoid wetting their paws. They\npeeped into the stable, and then stalked up to the sleeping girl, and\nlay down, purring, close by her. Moumou, the big black cat, curled\nitself up close to her cheek, and gently licked her chin.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And Serge?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 murmured Albine, quite mechanically.\n\nWhat was it that kept them apart? Who was it that prevented them from\nbeing happy together? Why might she not love him, and why might she\nnot be loved, freely and in the broad sunlight, as the trees lived and\nloved? She knew not, but she felt that she had been forsaken, and had\nreceived a mortal wound. Yet she was possessed by a stubborn, determined\nlonging, a very necessity, indeed, of once more clasping her love in\nher arms, of concealing him somewhere, that he might be hers in all\nfelicity. She rose to her feet. The vestry door had just been opened\nagain. A clapping of hands sounded, followed by the uproar of a swarm\nof children clattering in wooden shoes over the stone flags. The\ncatechising was over. Then Albine gently glided out of the stable, where\nshe had been waiting for an hour amidst the reeking warmth that emanated\nfrom Desiree\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pets.\n\nAs she quietly slipped through the passage that led to the vestry,\nshe caught sight of La Teuse, who was going to her kitchen, and who\nfortunately did not turn her head. Certain, now, of not being seen and\nstopped, Albine softly pushed the door which was before her, keeping\nhold of it in order that it might make no noise as it closed again.\n\nAnd she found herself in the church.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\nAt first she could see nobody. Outside, the rain had again begun to fall\nin fine close drops. The church looked very grey and gloomy. She passed\nbehind the high altar, and walked on towards the pulpit. In the middle\nof the nave, there were only a number of empty benches, left there in\ndisorder by the urchins of the catechism class. Amidst all this void\ncame a low tic-tac from the swaying pendulum. She went down the church\nto knock at the confessional-box, which she saw standing at the other\nend. But, just as she passed the Chapel of the Dead, she caught sight\nof Abbe Mouret prostrated before the great bleeding Christ. He did not\nstir; he must have thought that it was only La Teuse putting the seats\nin order behind him.\n\nBut Albine laid her hand upon his shoulder.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Serge,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I have come for you.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe priest raised his head with a start. His face was very pale. He\nremained on his knees and crossed himself, while his lips still quivered\nwith the words of his prayer.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I have been waiting for you,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she continued. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Every morning and every\nevening I looked to see if you were not coming. I have counted the days\ntill I could keep the reckoning no longer. Ah! for weeks and weeks----\nThen, when I grew sure that you were not coming, I set out myself, and\ncame here. I said to myself: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will fetch him away with me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Give me\nyour hand and let us go.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe stretched out her hands, as though to help him to rise. But he only\ncrossed himself, afresh. He still continued his prayers as he looked at\nher. He had succeeded in calming the first quiver of his flesh. From\nthe Divine grace which had been streaming around him since the early\nmorning, like a celestial bath, he derived a superhuman strength.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is not right for you to be here,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said, gravely. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Go away. You\nare aggravating your sufferings.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I suffer no longer,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said, with a smile. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I am well again; I am\ncured, now that I see you once more---- Listen! I made myself out\nworse than I really was, to induce them to go and fetch you. I am quite\nwilling to confess it now. And that promise of going away, of leaving\nthe neighbourhood, you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t suppose I should have kept it, did you?\nNo, indeed, unless I had carried you away with me on my shoulders. The\nothers don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know it, but you must know that I cannot now live anywhere\nbut at your side.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe grew quite cheerful again, and drew close to the priest with the\ncaressing ways of a child of nature, never noticing his cold and rigid\ndemeanour. And she became impatient, clapped her hands, and exclaimed:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Come, Serge; make up your mind and come. We are only losing time. There\nis no necessity to think so much about it. It is quite simple; I am\ngoing to take you with me. If you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want any one to see you, we will\ngo along by the Mascle. It is not very easy walking, but I managed it\nall by myself; and, when we are together, we can help each other. You\nknow the way, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you? We cross the churchyard, we descend to the\ntorrent, and then we shall only have to follow its course right up to\nthe garden. And one is quite at home down there. Nobody can see us,\nthere is nothing but brambles and big round stones. The bed of the\nstream is nearly dry. As I came along, I thought: \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy-and-by, when he is\nwith me, we will walk along gently together and kiss one another.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Come,\nSerge, be quick; I am waiting for you.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe priest no longer appeared to hear her. He had betaken himself to\nhis prayers again, and was asking Heaven to grant him the courage of the\nsaints. Before entering upon the supreme struggle, he was arming himself\nwith the flaming sword of faith. For a moment he had feared he was\nwavering. He had required all a martyr\u00e2\u0080\u0099s courage and endurance to remain\nfirmly kneeling there on the flagstones, while Albine was calling\nhim: his heart had leapt out towards her, all his blood had surged\npassionately through his veins, filling him with an intense yearning to\nclasp her in his arms and kiss her hair. Her mere breath had awakened\nall the memory of their love; the vast garden, their saunters beneath\nthe trees, and all the joy of their companionship.\n\nBut Divine grace was poured down upon him more abundantly, and the\ntorturing strife, during which all his blood seemed to quit his veins,\nlasted but a moment. Nothing human then remained within him. He had\nbecome wholly God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\n\nAlbine, however, again touched him on the shoulder. She was growing\nuneasy and angry.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Why do you not speak to me?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she asked. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t refuse; you will\ncome with me? Remember that I shall die if you refuse. But no! you\ncan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t; it is impossible. We lived together once; it was vowed that we\nshould never separate. Twenty times, at least, did you give yourself to\nme. You bade me take you wholly, your limbs, your breath, your very life\nitself. I did not dream it all. There is nothing of you that you have\nnot given to me; not a hair in your head which is not mine. Your hands\nare mine. For days and days have I held them clasped in mine. Your face,\nyour lips, your eyes, your brow, all, all are mine, and I have lavished\nmy love upon them. Do you hear me, Serge?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe stood erect before him, full of proud assertion, with outstretched\narms. And, in a louder voice, she repeated:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Do you hear me, Serge? You belong to me.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen Abbe Mouret slowly rose to his feet. He leant against the altar,\nand replied:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No. You are mistaken. I belong to God.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe was full of serenity. His shorn face seemed like that of some stone\nsaint, whom no impulse of the flesh can disturb. His cassock fell around\nhim in straight folds like a black winding-sheet, concealing all the\noutlines of his body. Albine dropped back at the sight of that sombre\nphantom of her former love. She missed his freely flowing beard, his\nfreely flowing curls. And in the midst of his shorn locks she saw the\npallid circle of his tonsure, which disquieted her as if it had been\nsome mysterious evil, some malignant sore which had grown there, and\nwould eat away all memory of the happy days they had spent together. She\ncould recognise neither his hands, once so warm with caresses, nor his\nlissom neck, once so sonorous with laughter; nor his agile feet, which\nhad carried her into the recesses of the woodlands. Could this, indeed,\nbe the strong youth with whom she had lived one whole season--the youth\nwith soft down gleaming on his bare breast, with skin browned by the\nsun\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rays, with every limb full of vibrating life? At this present\nhour he seemed fleshless; his hair had fallen away from him, and all his\nvirility had withered within that womanish gown, which left him sexless.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh! you frighten me,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she murmured. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Did you think then that I was\ndead, that you put on mourning? Take off that black thing; put on a\nblouse. You can tuck up the sleeves, and we will catch crayfishes again.\nYour arms used to be as white as mine.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe laid her hand on his cassock, as though to tear it off him; but he\nrepulsed her with a gesture, without touching her. He looked at her now\nand strengthened himself against temptation by never allowing his eyes\nto leave her. She seemed to him to have grown taller. She was no longer\nthe playful damsel adorned with bunches of wild-flowers, and casting to\nthe winds gay, gipsy laughter, nor was she the amorosa in white skirts,\ngracefully bending her slender form as she sauntered lingeringly beside\nthe hedges. Now, there was a velvety bloom upon her lips; her hips were\ngracefully rounded; her bosom was in full bloom. She had become a woman,\nwith a long oval face that seemed expressive of fruitfulness. Life\nslumbered within her. And her cheeks glowed with luscious maturity.\n\nThe priest, bathed in the voluptuous atmosphere that seemed to emanate\nfrom all that feminine ripeness, took a bitter pleasure in defying the\ncaresses of her coral lips, the tempting smile of her eyes, the witching\ncharm of her bosom, and all the intoxication which seemed to pour from\nher at every movement. He even carried his temerity so far as to search\nwith his gaze for the spots that he had once so hotly kissed, the\ncorners of her eyes and lips, her narrow temples, soft as satin, and the\nambery nape of her neck, which was like velvet. And never, even in\nher embrace, had he tasted such felicity as he now felt in martyring\nhimself, by boldly looking in the face the love that he refused. At\nlast, fearing lest he might there yield to some new allurement of the\nflesh, he dropped his eyes, and said, very gently:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I cannot hear you here. Let us go out, if you, indeed, persist in\nadding to the pain of both of us. Our presence in this place is a\nscandal. We are in God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098God!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cried Albine, excitedly, suddenly becoming a child of nature\nonce more. \u00e2\u0080\u0098God! Who is He? I know nothing of your God! I want to know\nnothing of Him if He has stolen you away from me, who have never harmed\nHim. My uncle Jeanbernat was right then when he said that your God was\nonly an invention to frighten people, and make them weep! You are lying;\nyou love me no longer, and that God of yours does not exist.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You are in His house now,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Abbe Mouret, sternly. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You blaspheme.\nWith a breath He might turn you into dust.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe laughed with proud disdain, and raised her hands as if to defy\nHeaven.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! then,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said she, \u00e2\u0080\u0098you prefer your God to me. You think He is\nstronger than I am, and you imagine that He will love you better than\nI did. Oh! but you are a child, a foolish child. Come, leave all this\nfolly. We will return to the garden together, and love each other, and\nbe happy and free. That, that is life!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThis time she succeeded in throwing an arm round his waist, and she\ntried to drag him away. But he, quivering all over, freed himself from\nher embrace, and again took his stand against the altar.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Go away!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he faltered. \u00e2\u0080\u0098If you still love me, go away.... O Lord,\npardon her, and pardon me too, for thus defiling this Thy house. Should\nI go with her beyond the door, I might, perhaps, follow her. Here, in\nThy presence, I am strong. Suffer that I may remain here, to protect\nThee from insult.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAlbine remained silent for a moment. Then, in a calm voice, she said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, let us stay here, then. I wish to speak to you. You cannot,\nsurely, be cruel. You will understand me. You will not let me go away\nalone. Oh! do not begin to excuse yourself. I will not lay my hands upon\nyou again, since it distresses you. I am quite calm now as you can see.\nWe will talk quietly, as we used to do in the old days when we lost our\nway, and did not hurry to find it again, that we might have the more\ntime to talk together.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe smiled at that memory, and continued:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know about these things myself. My uncle Jeanbernat used to\nforbid me to go to church. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSilly girl,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say to me, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy do you\nwant to go to a stuffy building when you have got a garden to run about\nin?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I grew up quite happy and contented. I used to look in the birds\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nnests without even taking the eggs. I did not even pluck the flowers,\nfor fear of hurting the plants; and you know that I could never torture\nan insect. Why, then, should God be angry with me?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You should learn to know Him, pray to Him, and render Him the constant\nworship which is His due,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 answered the priest.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! it would please you if I did, would it not?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You would\nforgive me, and love me again? Well, I will do all that you wish me.\nTell me about God, and I will believe in Him, and worship Him. All that\nyou tell me shall be a truth to which I will listen on my knees. Have I\never had a thought that was not your own? We will begin our long walks\nagain; and you shall teach me, and make of me whatever you will. Say\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cyes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I beg of you.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAbbe Mouret pointed to his cassock.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I cannot,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he simply said. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I am a priest.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098A priest!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she repeated after him, the smile dying out of her eyes. \u00e2\u0080\u0098My\nuncle says that priests have neither wife, nor sister, nor mother. So\nthat is true, then. But why did you ever come? It was you who took me\nfor your sister, for your wife. Were you then lying?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe priest raised his pale face, moist with the sweat of agony. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I have\nsinned,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he murmured.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098When I saw you so free,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the girl went on, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I thought that you were\nno longer a priest. I believed that all that was over, that you would\nalways remain there with me, and for my sake.---- And now, what would\nyou have me do, if you rob me of my whole life?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What I do,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he answered; \u00e2\u0080\u0098kneel down, suffer on your knees, and never\nrise until God pardons you.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Are you a coward, then?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she exclaimed, her anger roused once more, her\nlips curving scornfully.\n\nHe staggered, and kept silence. Agony held him by the throat; but he\nproved stronger than pain. He held his head erect, and a smile almost\nplayed about his trembling lips. Albine for a moment defied him with\nher fixed glance; then, carried away by a fresh burst of passion, she\nexclaimed:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, answer me. Accuse me! Say it was I who came to tempt you! That\nwill be the climax! Speak, and say what you can for yourself. Strike me\nif you like. I should prefer your blows to that corpse-like stiffness\nyou put on. Is there no blood left in your veins? Have you no spirit?\nDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you hear me calling you a coward? Yes, indeed, you are a coward.\nYou should never have loved me, since you may not be a man. Is it that\nblack robe of yours which holds you back? Tear it off! When you are\nnaked, perhaps you will remember yourself again.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe priest slowly repeated his former words:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I have sinned. I had no excuse for my sin. I do penitence for my sin\nwithout hope of pardon. If I tore off my cassock, I should tear away my\nvery flesh, for I have given myself wholly to God, soul and body. I am a\npriest.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And I! what is to become of me?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cried Albine.\n\nHe looked unflinchingly at her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098May your sufferings be reckoned against me as so many crimes! May I be\neternally punished for the desertion in which I am forced to leave you!\nThat will be only just. All unworthy though I be, I pray for you each\nnight.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe shrugged her shoulders with an air of great discouragement. Her\nanger was subsiding. She almost felt inclined to pity him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You are mad,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she murmured. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Keep your prayers. It is you yourself that\nI want. But you will never understand me. There were so many things\nI wanted to tell you! Yet you stand there and irritate me with your\nchatter of another world. Come, let us try to talk sensibly. Let us wait\nfor a moment till we are calmer. You cannot dismiss me in this way,\nI cannot leave you here. It is because you are here that you are so\ncorpse-like, so cold that I dare not touch you. We won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t talk any more\njust now. We will wait a little.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe ceased speaking, and took a few steps, examining the little church.\nThe rain was still gently pattering against the windows; and the cold\ndamp light seemed to moisten the walls. Not a sound came from outside\nsave the monotonous plashing of the rain. The sparrows were doubtless\ncrouching for shelter under the tiles, and the rowan-tree\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deserted\nbranches showed but indistinctly in the veiling, drenching downpour.\nFive o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock struck, grated out, stroke by stroke, from the wheezy chest\nof the old clock; and then the silence fell again, seeming to grow yet\ndeeper, dimmer, and more despairing. The priest\u00e2\u0080\u0099s painting work, as yet\nscarcely dry, gave to the high altar and the wainscoting an appearance\nof gloomy cleanliness, like that of some convent chapel where the sun\nnever shines. Grievous anguish seemed to fill the nave, splashed with\nthe blood that flowed from the limbs of the huge Christ; while, along\nthe walls, the fourteen scenes of the Passion displayed their awful\nstory in red and yellow daubs, reeking with horror. It was life that was\nsuffering the last agonies there, amidst that deathlike quiver of the\natmosphere, upon those altars which resembled tombs, in that bare vault\nwhich looked like a sepulchre. The surroundings all spoke of slaughter\nand gloom, terror and anguish and nothingness. A faint scent of incense\nstill lingered there, like the last expiring breath of some dead girl,\nwho had been hurriedly stifled beneath the flagstones.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Albine at last, \u00e2\u0080\u0098how sweet it used to be in the sunshine!\nDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you remember? One morning we walked past a hedge of tall rose\nbushes, to the left of the flower-garden. I recollect the very colour of\nthe grass; it was almost blue, shot with green. When we reached the end\nof the hedge we turned and walked back again, so sweet was the perfume\nof the sunny air. And we did nothing else, that morning; we took just\ntwenty paces forward and then twenty paces back. It was so sweet a spot\nyou would not leave it. The bees buzzed all around; and there was a\ntomtit that never left us, but skipped along by our side from branch to\nbranch. You whispered to me, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow delightful is life!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ah! life! it was\nthe green grass, the trees, the running waters, the sky, and the sun,\namongst which we seemed all fair and golden.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe mused for another moment and then continued: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Life \u00e2\u0080\u0098twas the\nParadou. How vast it used to seem to us! Never were we able to find the\nend of it. The sea of foliage rolled freely with rustling waves as far\nas the eye could reach. And all that glorious blue overhead! we were\nfree to grow, and soar, and roam, like the clouds without meeting more\nobstacles than they. The very air was ours!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe stopped and pointed to the low walls of the church.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But, here, you are in a grave. You cannot stretch out your hand without\nhurting it against the stones. The roof hides the sky from you and blots\nout the sun. It is all so small and confined that your limbs grow stiff\nand cramped as though you were buried alive.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 answered the priest. \u00e2\u0080\u0098The church is wide as the world.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut she waved her hands towards the crosses, and the dying Christ, and\nthe pictures of the Passion.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And you live in the very midst of death. The grass, the trees, the\nsprings, the sun, the sky, all are in the death throes around you.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No, no; all revives, all grows purified and reascends to the source of\nlight.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe had now drawn himself quite erect, with flashing eyes. And feeling\nthat he was now invincible, so permeated with faith as to disdain\ntemptation, he quitted the altar, took Albine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand, and led her, as\nthough she had been his sister, to the ghastly pictures of the Stations\nof the Cross.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098See,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098this is what God suffered! Jesus is cruelly scourged.\nLook! His shoulders are naked; His flesh is torn; His blood flows down\nHis back.... And Jesus is crowned with thorns. Tears of blood trickle\ndown His gashed brow. On His temple is a jagged wound.... Again Jesus is\ninsulted by the soldiers. His murderers have scoffingly thrown a purple\nrobe around His shoulders, and they spit upon His face and strike Him,\nand press the thorny crown deep into His flesh.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAlbine turned away her head, that she might not see the crudely painted\npictures, in which the ochreous flesh of Christ had been plentifully\nbedaubed with carmine wounds. The purple robe round His shoulders seemed\nlike a shred of His skin torn away.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Why suffer? why die?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said. \u00e2\u0080\u0098O Serge, if you would only\nremember!... You told me, that morning, that you were tired. But I knew\nthat you were only pretending, for the air was quite cool and we had\nonly been walking for a quarter of an hour. But you wanted to sit down\nthat you might hold me in your arms. Right down in the orchard, by\nthe edge of a stream, there was a cherry tree--you remember it, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nyou?--which you never could pass without wishing to kiss my hands. And\nyour kisses ran all up my arms and shoulders to my lips. Cherry time was\nover, and so you devoured my lips.... It used to make us feel so sad to\nsee the flowers fading, and one day, when you found a dead bird in the\ngrass, you turned quite pale, and caught me to your breast, as if to\nforbid the earth to take me.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut the priest drew her towards the other Stations of the Cross.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Hush! hush!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he cried, \u00e2\u0080\u0098look here, and here! Bow down in grief and\npity---- Jesus falls beneath the weight of His cross. The ascent of\nCalvary is very tiring. He has dropped down on His knees. But He does\nnot stay to wipe even the sweat from His brow, He rises up again and\ncontinues His journey.... And again Jesus falls beneath the weight of\nHis cross. At each step He staggers. This time He has fallen on His\nside, so heavily that for a moment He lies there quite breathless. His\nlacerated hands have relaxed their hold upon the cross. His bruised and\naching feet leave blood-stained prints behind them. Agonising weariness\noverwhelms Him, for He carries upon His shoulders the sins of the whole\nworld.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAlbine gazed at the pictured Jesus, lying in a blue shirt prostrate\nbeneath the cross, the blackness of which bedimmed the gold of His\naureole. Then, with her glance wandering far away, she said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh! those meadow-paths! Have you no memory left, Serge? Have you\nforgotten those soft grassy walks through the meadows, amidst very seas\nof greenery? On the afternoon I am telling you of, we had only meant\nto stay out of doors an hour; but we went wandering on and were still\nwandering when the stars came out above us. Ah! how velvety it was, that\nendless carpet, soft as finest silk! It was just like a green sea whose\ngentle waters lapped us round. And well we knew whither those beguiling\npaths that led nowhere, were taking us! They were taking us to our love,\nto the joy of living together, to the certainty of happiness.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nWith his hands trembling with anguish, Abbe Mouret pointed to the\nremaining pictures.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Jesus,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he stammered, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Jesus is nailed to the cross. The nails are\nhammered through His outspread hands. A single nail suffices for his\nfeet, whose bones split asunder. He, Himself, while His flesh quivers\nwith pain, fixes His eyes upon heaven and smiles.... Jesus is crucified\nbetween two thieves. The weight of His body terribly aggravates His\nwounds. From His brow, from His limbs, does a bloody sweat stream down.\nThe two thieves insult Him, the passers-by mock at Him, the soldiers\ncast lots for His raiment. And the shadowy darkness grows deeper and the\nsun hides himself.... Jesus dies upon the cross. He utters a piercing\ncry and gives up the ghost. Oh! most terrible of deaths! The veil of the\ntemple is rent in twain from top to bottom. The earth quakes, the stones\nare broken, and the very graves open.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe priest had fallen on his knees, his voice choked by sobs, his eyes\nfixed upon the three crosses of Calvary, where writhed the gaunt pallid\nbodies of the crucified. Albine placed herself in front of the paintings\nin order that he might no longer see them.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098One evening,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I lay through the long gloaming with my head\nupon your lap. It was in the forest, at the end of that great avenue of\nchestnut-trees, through which the setting sun shot a parting ray. Ah!\nwhat a caressing farewell He bade us! He lingered awhile by our feet\nwith a kindly smile, as if saying \u00e2\u0080\u009cTill to-morrow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The sky slowly grew\npaler. I told you merrily that it was taking off its blue gown, and\ndonning its gold-flowered robe of black to go out for the evening.\nAnd it was not night that fell, but a soft dimness, a veil of love and\nmystery, reminding us of those dusky paths, where the foliage arches\noverhead, one of those paths in which one hides for a moment with the\ncertainty of finding the joyousness of daylight at the other end.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098That evening the calm clearness of the twilight gave promise of a\nsplendid morrow. When I saw that it did not grow dark as quickly as you\nwished, I pretended to fall asleep. I may confess it to you now, but\nI was not really sleeping while you kissed me on the eyes. I felt your\nkisses and tried to keep from laughing. And then, when the darkness\nreally came, it was like one long caress. The trees slept no more than\nI did. At night, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you remember, the flowers always breathed a\nstronger perfume.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen, as he still remained on his knees, while tears streamed down his\nface, she caught him by the wrists, and pulled him to his feet, resuming\npassionately:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh! if you knew you would bid me carry you off; you would fasten your\narms about my neck, lest I should go away without you.... Yesterday I\nhad a longing to see the garden once more. It seems larger, deeper,\nmore unfathomable than ever. I discovered there new scents, so sweetly\naromatic that they brought tears into my eyes. In the avenues I found a\nrain of sunbeams that thrilled me with desire. The roses spoke to me\nof you. The bullfinches were amazed at seeing me alone. All the garden\nbroke out into sighs. Oh! come! Never has the grass spread itself out\nmore softly. I have marked with a flower the hidden nook whither I\nlong to take you. It is a nest of greenery in the midst of a tangle of\nbrushwood. And there one can hear all the teeming life of the garden, of\nthe trees and the streams and the sky. The earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very breathing\nwill softly lull us to rest there. Oh! come! come! and let us love one\nanother amidst that universal loving!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut he pushed her from him. He had returned to the Chapel of the\nDead and stood in front of the painted papier-mache Christ, big as a\nten-year-old boy, that writhed in such horridly realistic agony. There\nwere real iron nails driven into the figure\u00e2\u0080\u0099s limbs, and the wounds\ngaped in the torn and bleeding flesh.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098O Jesus, Who hast died for us!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cried the priest, \u00e2\u0080\u0098convince her of our\nnothingness! Tell her that we are but dust, rottenness, and damnation!\nAh! suffer that I may hide my head in a hair-cloth and rest it against\nThy feet and stay there, motionless, until I rot away in death. The\nearth will no longer exist for me. The sun will no longer shine. I\nshall see nothing more, feel nothing, hear nothing. Nought of all this\nwretched world will come to turn my soul from its adoration of Thee.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe was gradually becoming more and more excited, and he stepped towards\nAlbine with upraised hands.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You said rightly. It is Death that is present here; Death that is\nbefore my eyes; Death that delivers and saves one from all rottenness.\nHear me! I renounce, I deny life, I wholly refuse it, I spit upon it.\nThose flowers of yours stink; your sun dazzles and blinds; your\ngrass makes lepers of those that lie upon it; your garden is but\na charnel-place where all rots and putrefies. The earth reeks with\nabomination. You lie when you talk of love and light and gladsome life\nin the depths of your palace of greenery. There is nought but darkness\nthere. Those trees of yours exhale a poison which transforms men into\nbeasts; your thickets are charged with the venom of vipers; your streams\ncarry pestilence in their blue waters. If I could snatch away from that\nworld of nature, which you extol, its kirtle of sunshine and its girdle\nof greenery, you would see it hideous like a very fury, a skeleton,\nrotting away with disease and vice.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And even if you spoke the truth, even if your hands were really filled\nwith pleasures, even if you should carry me to a couch of roses and\noffer me the dreams of Paradise, I would defend myself yet the more\ndesperately from your embraces. There is war between us; war eternal and\nimplacable. See! the church is very small; it is poverty-stricken; it is\nugly; its confessional-box and pulpit are made of common deal, its font\nis merely of plaster, its altars are formed of four boards which I have\npainted myself. But what of that? It is yet vaster than your garden,\ngreater than the valley, greater, even, than the whole earth. It is an\nimpregnable fortress which nothing can ever break down. The winds, the\nsun, the forests, the ocean, all that is, may combine to assault it; yet\nit will stand erect and unshaken for ever!\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes, let all the jungles tower aloft and assail the walls with their\nthorny arms, let all the legions of insects swarm out of their holes\nin the ground and gnaw at the walls; the church, ruinous though it may\nseem, will never fall before the invasion of life. It is Death, Death\nthe inexpugnable!... And do you know what will one day happen? The\ntiny church will grow and spread to such a colossal size, and will cast\naround such a mighty shadow, that all that nature, you speak of, will\ngive up the ghost. Ah! Death, the Death of everything, with the skies\ngaping to receive our souls, above the curse-stricken ruins of the\nworld!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAs he shouted those last words, he pushed Albine forcibly towards the\ndoor. She, extremely pale, retreated step by step. When he had finished\nin a gasping voice she very gravely answered:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is all over, then? You drive me away? Yet, I am your wife. It is you\nwho made me so. And God, since He permitted it, cannot punish us to such\na point as this.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe was now on the threshold, and she added:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Listen! Every day, at sunset, I go to the end of the garden, to the\nspot where the wall has fallen in. I shall wait for you there.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAnd then she disappeared. The vestry door fell back with a sound like a\ndeep sigh.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\nThe church was perfectly silent, except for the murmuring sound of the\nrain, which was falling heavily once more. In that sudden change to\nquietude the priest\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anger subsided, and he even felt moved. It was\nwith his face streaming with tears, his frame shaken by sobs, that he\nwent back to throw himself on his knees before the great crucifix. A\ntorrent of ardent thanksgiving burst from his lips.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Thanks be to Thee, O God, for the help which Thou hast graciously\nbestowed upon me. Without Thy grace I should have hearkened unto the\npromptings of my flesh, and should have miserably returned to my sin. It\nwas Thy grace that girded my loins as with armour for battle; Thy grace\nwas indeed my armour, my courage, the support of my soul, that kept me\nerect, beyond weakness. Oh! my God, Thou wert in me; it was Thy voice\nthat spoke in me, for I no longer felt the cowardice of the flesh, I\ncould have cut asunder my very heart-strings. And now, O God, I offer\nThee my bleeding heart. It no longer belongs to any creature of this\nworld; it is Thine alone. To give it to Thee I have wrenched it from all\nworldly affection. But think not, O God, that I take any pride to myself\nfor this victory. I know that without Thee I am nothing; and I humbly\ncast myself at Thy feet.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe sank down upon the altar steps, unable to utter another word, while\nhis breath panted incense-like from his parted lips. The divine grace\nbathed him in ineffable ecstasy. He sought Jesus in the recesses of his\nbeing, in that sanctuary of love which he was ever preparing for His\nworthy reception. And Jesus was now present there. The Abbe knew it by\nthe sweet influences which permeated him. And thereupon he joined with\nJesus in that spiritual converse which at times bore him away from earth\nto companionship with God. He sighed out the verse from the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Song of\nSolomon,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098My beloved is mine, and I am his; He feedeth his flock\namong the lilies, until the day be cool, and the shadows flee away.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 He\npondered over the words of the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Imitation:\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098It is a great art to know\nhow to talk with Jesus, and it requires much prudence to keep Him near\none.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And then, with adorable condescension, Jesus came down to him,\nand spoke with him for hours of his needs, his happiness, and his hopes.\nTheir confidences were not less affectionate and touching than those\nof two friends, who meet after long separation and quietly retire to\nconverse on the bank of some lonely stream; for during those hours of\ndivine condescension Jesus deigned to be his friend, his best, most\nfaithful friend, one who never forsook him, and who in return for a\nlittle love gave him all the treasures of eternal life. That day the\npriest was eager to prolong the sweet converse, and indeed, when six\no\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock sounded through the quiet church, he was still listening to the\nwords which echoed through his soul.\n\nOn his side there was unreserved confession, unimpeded by the restraints\nof language, natural effusion of the heart which spoke even more quickly\nthan the mind. Abbe Mouret told everything to Jesus, as to a God who\nhad come down in all the intimacy of the most loving tenderness, and who\nwould listen to everything. He confessed that he still loved Albine; and\nhe was surprised that he had been able to speak sternly to her and drive\nher away, without his whole being breaking out into revolt. He marvelled\nat it, and smiled as though it were some wonderful miracle performed by\nanother. And Jesus told him that he must not be astonished, and that the\ngreatest saints were often but unconscious instruments in the hands of\nGod. Then the Abbe gave expression to a doubt. Had he not lost merit in\nseeking refuge in the Cross and even in the Passion of his Saviour? Had\nhe not shown that he possessed as yet but little courage, since he had\nnot dared to fight unaided? But Jesus evinced kindly tolerance, and\nanswered that man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weakness was God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s continual care, and that He\nespecially loved those suffering souls, to whose assistance He went,\nlike a friend to the bedside of a sick companion.\n\nBut was it a sin to love Albine, a sin for which he, Serge, would\nbe damned? No; if his love was clean of all fleshly taint, and added\nanother hope to his desire for eternal life. But, then, how was he to\nlove her? In silence; without speaking a word to her, without taking a\nstep towards her; simply allowing his pure affection to breathe forth,\nlike a sweet perfume, pleasing unto heaven. And Jesus smiled with\nincreasing kindliness, drawing nearer as if to encourage confession, in\nsuch wise that the priest grew bolder and began to recapitulate Albine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ncharms. She had hair that was fair and golden as an angel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s; she was\nvery white, with big soft eyes, like those of the aureoled saints. Jesus\nseemed to listen to this in silence, though a smile still played upon\nHis face. And the priest continued: She had grown much taller. She was\nnow like a queen, with rounded form and splendid shoulders. Oh! to clasp\nher waist, were it only for a second, and to feel her shoulders drawn\nclose by his embrace! But the smile on the divine countenance then\npaled and died away, as a star sinks and falls beneath the horizon.\nAbbe Mouret now spoke all alone. Ah! had he not shown himself too\nhard-hearted? Why had he driven her away without one single word of\naffection, since Heaven allowed him to love her?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I do love her! I do love her!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he cried aloud, in a distracted voice,\nthat rang through the church.\n\nHe thought he saw her still standing there. She was stretching out her\narms to him; she was beautiful enough to make him break all his vows. He\nthrew himself upon her bosom without thought of the reverence due to\nhis surroundings, he clasped her and rained kisses upon her face. It was\nbefore her that he now knelt, imploring her mercy, and beseeching her to\nforgive him his unkindness. He told her that, at times a voice which was\nnot his own spoke through his lips. Could he himself ever have treated\nher harshly? It was the strange voice that had repulsed her. It could\nnot, surely, be he himself, for he would have been unable to touch a\nhair of her head without loving emotion. And yet he had driven her away.\nThe church was really empty! Whither should he hasten to find her again,\nto bring her back, and wipe her tears away with kisses? The rain was\nstreaming down more violently than ever. The roads must be rivers\nof mud. He pictured her to himself lashed by the downpour, tottering\nalongside the ditches, her clothes soaked and clinging to her skin. No!\nno! it could not have been himself; it was that other voice, the jealous\nvoice that had so cruelly sought to slay his love.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098O Jesus!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he cried in desperation, \u00e2\u0080\u0098be merciful and give her back to\nme!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut his Lord was no longer there. Then Abbe Mouret, awaking with a\nstart, turned horribly pale. He understood it all. He had not known\nhow to keep Jesus with him. He had lost his friend, and had been left\ndefenceless against the powers of evil. Instead of that inward light,\nwhich had shone so brightly within him as he received his God, he now\nfound utter darkness, a foul vapour that irritated his senses. Jesus had\nwithdrawn His grace on leaving him; and he, who since early morning\nhad been so strong with heaven-sent help, now felt utterly miserable,\nforsaken, weak and helpless as an infant. How frightful was his fall!\nHow galling its bitterness! To have straggled so heroically, to have\nremained unshaken, invincible, implacable, while the temptress actually\nstood before him, with all her warm life, her swelling bosom and\nsuperb shoulders, her perfume of love and passion; and then to fall\nso shamefully, to throb with desire, when she had disappeared, leaving\nbehind her but the echo of her skirts, and the fragrance diffused from\nher white neck! Now, these mere recollections sufficed to make her all\npowerful, her influence permeated the church.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Jesus! Jesus!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cried the priest, once more, \u00e2\u0080\u0098return, come back to me;\nspeak to me once again!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut Jesus remained deaf to his cry. For a moment Abbe Mouret raised his\narms to heaven in desperate entreaty. His shoulders cracked and strained\nbeneath the wild violence of his supplications. But soon his hands fell\ndown again in discouragement. Heaven preserved that hopeless silence\nwhich suppliants at times encounter. Then he once more sat down on the\naltar steps, heart-crushed and with ashen face, pressing his elbows to\nhis sides, as though he were trying to reduce his flesh to the smallest\nproportions possible.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098My God! Thou deserted me!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he murmured. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Nevertheless, Thy will be\ndone!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe spoke not another word, but sat there, panting breathlessly, like a\nhunted beast that cowers motionless in fear of the hounds. Ever since\nhis sin, he had thus seemed to be the sport of the divine grace. It\ndenied itself to his most ardent prayers; it poured down upon him,\nunexpectedly and refreshingly, when he had lost all hope of winning it\nfor long years to come.\n\nAt first he had been inclined to rebel against this dispensation of\nHeaven, complaining like a betrayed lover, and demanding the immediate\nreturn of that consoling grace, whose kiss made him so strong. But\nafterwards, after unavailing outbursts of anger, he had learned to\nunderstand that humility profited him most and could alone enable him to\nendure the withdrawal of the divine assistance. Then, for hours and for\ndays, he would humble himself and wait for comfort which came not. In\nvain he cast himself unreservedly into the hands of God, annihilated\nhimself before the Divinity, wearied himself with the incessant\nrepetition of prayers. He could not perceive God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presence with him;\nand his flesh, breaking free from all restraint, rose up in rebellious\ndesire. It was a slow agony of temptation, in which the weapons of faith\nfell, one by one, from his faltering hands, in which he lay inert in\nthe clutch of passion, in which he beheld with horror his own ignominy,\nwithout having the courage to raise his little finger to free himself\nfrom the thraldom of sin.\n\nSuch was now his life. He had felt sin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attacks in every form. Not\na day passed that he was not tried. Sin assumed a thousand guises,\nassailed him through his eyes and ears, flew boldly at his throat,\nleaped treacherously upon his shoulders, or stole torturingly into\nhis bones. His transgression was ever present, he almost always beheld\nAlbine dazzling as the sunshine, lighting up the greenery of the\nParadou. He only ceased to see her in those rare moments when the divine\ngrace deigned to close his eyes with its cool caresses. And he strove to\nhide his sufferings as one hides those of some disgraceful disease. He\nwrapped himself in the endless silence, which no one knew how to make\nhim break, filling the parsonage with his martyrdom and resignation, and\nexasperating La Teuse, who, at times, when his back was turned, would\nshake her fist at heaven.\n\nThis time he was alone now, and need take no care to hide his torment.\nSin had just struck him such an overwhelming blow, that he had not\nstrength left to move from the altar steps, where he had fallen. He\nremained there, sighing, and groaning, parched with agony, incapable of\na single tear. And he thought of the calm unruffled life that had once\nbeen his. Ah! the perfect peace, the full confidence of his first days\nat Les Artaud! The path of salvation had seemed so straight and easy\nthen! He had smiled at the very mention of temptation. He had lived in\nthe midst of wickedness, without knowledge of it, without fear of it,\ncertain of being able to withstand it. He had been a model priest, so\npure and chaste, so inexperienced and innocent in God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sight, that God\nhad led him by the hand like a little child.\n\nBut now, all that childlike innocence was dead, God visited him in the\nmorning, and forthwith tried him. A state of temptation became his life\non earth. Now that full manhood and sin had come upon him, he entered\ninto the everlasting struggle. Could it be that God really loved him\nmore now than before? The great saints have all left fragments of their\ntorn flesh upon the thorns of the way of sorrow. He tried to gather some\nconsolation from this circumstance. At each laceration of his flesh,\neach racking of his bones, he tried to assure himself of some exceeding\ngreat reward. And then, no infliction that Heaven might now cast upon\nhim could be too heavy. He even looked back with scorn on his former\nserenity, his easy fervour, which had set him on his knees with mere\ngirlish enthusiasm, and left him unconscious even of the bruising of the\nhard stones. He strove also to discover pleasure in pain, in plunging\ninto it, annihilating himself in it. But, even while he poured out\nthanks to God, his teeth chattered with growing terror, and the voice of\nhis rebellious blood cried out to him that this was all falsehood, and\nthat the only happiness worth desiring was in Albine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arms, amongst the\nflowers of the Paradou.\n\nYet he had put aside Mary for Jesus, sacrificing his heart that he might\nsubdue his flesh, and hoping to implant some virility in his faith.\nMary disquieted him too much, with her smoothly braided hair, her\noutstretched hands, and her womanly smile. He could never kneel before\nher without dropping his eyes, for fear of catching sight of the hem of\nher dress. Then, too, he accused her of having treated him too tenderly\nin former times. She had kept him sheltered so long within the folds of\nher robe, that he had let himself slip from her arms to those of a human\ncreature without being conscious even of the change of his affection.\nHe thought of all the roughness of Brother Archangias, of his refusal\nto worship Mary, of the distrustful glances with which he had seemed\nto watch her. He himself despaired of ever rising to such a height of\nroughness, and so he simply left her, hiding her images and deserting\nher altar. Yet she remained in his heart, like some love which, though\nunavowed, is ever present. Sin, with sacrilege whose very horror made\nhim shudder, made use of her to tempt him.\n\nWhenever he still invoked her, as he did at times of irrepressible\nemotion, it was Albine who showed herself beneath the white veil, with\nthe blue scarf knotted round her waist and the golden roses blooming on\nher bare feet. All the representations of the Virgin, the Virgin with\nthe royal mantle of cloth-of-gold, the Virgin crowned with stars, the\nVirgin visited by the Angel of the Annunciation, the peaceful Virgin\npoised between a lily and a distaff, all brought him some memory of\nAlbine, her smiling eyes or her delicately curved mouth or her softly\nrounded cheeks.\n\nThereupon, by a supreme effort, he drove the female element from his\nworship, and sought refuge in Jesus, though even His gentle mildness\nsometimes proved a source of disquietude to him. What he needed was a\njealous God, an implacable God, the Jehovah of the Old Testament, girded\nwith thunder and manifesting Himself only to chastise the terrified\nworld. He had done with the saints and the angels and the Divine Mother;\nhe bowed down before God Himself alone, the omnipotent Master, who\ndemanded from him his every breath. And he felt the hand of this God\nlaid heavily upon him, holding him helpless at His mercy through space\nand time, like a guilty atom. Ah! to be nothing, to be damned, to dream\nof hell, to wrestle vainly against hideous temptations, all that was\nsurely good.\n\nFrom Jesus he took but the cross. He was seized with that passion for\nthe cross which has made so many lips press themselves again and again\nto the crucifix till they were worn away with kissing. He took up the\ncross and followed Jesus. He sought to make it heavier, the mightiest of\nburdens; it was great joy to him to fall beneath its weight, to drag it\non his knees, his back half broken. In it he beheld the only source\nof strength for the soul, of joy for the mind, of the consummation of\nvirtue and the perfection of holiness. In it lay all that was good; all\nended in death upon it. To suffer and to die, those words ever sounded\nin his ears, as the end and goal of mortal wisdom. And, when he had\nfastened himself to the cross, he enjoyed the boundless consolation of\nGod\u00e2\u0080\u0099s love. It was no longer, now, upon Mary that he lavished filial\ntenderness or lover\u00e2\u0080\u0099s passion. He loved for love\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mere sake, with an\nabsolute abstract love. He loved God with a love that lifted him out of\nhimself, out of all else, and wrapped him round with a dazzling radiance\nof glory. He was like a torch that burns away with blazing light. And\ndeath seemed to him to be only a great impulse of love.\n\nBut what had he omitted to do that he was thus so sorely tried? With\nhis hand he wiped away the perspiration that streamed down his brow,\nand reflected that, that very morning, he had made his usual\nself-examination without finding any great guilt within him. Was he not\nleading a life of great austerity and mortification of the flesh? Did he\nnot love God solely and blindly? Ah! how he would have blessed His Holy\nName had He only restored him his peace, deeming him now sufficiently\npunished for his transgression! But, perhaps, that sin of his could\nnever be expiated. And then, in spite of himself, his mind reverted to\nAlbine and the Paradou, and all their memories.\n\nAt first he tried to make excuses for himself. He had fallen, one\nevening, senseless upon the tiled floor of his bedroom, stricken with\nbrain fever. For three weeks he had remained unconscious. His blood\nsurged furiously through his veins and raged within him like a torrent\nthat had burst its banks. His whole body, from the crown of his head to\nthe soles of his feet, was so scoured and renewed and wrought afresh\nby the mighty labouring of his ailment, that in his delirium he had\nsometimes thought he could hear the very hammer blows of workmen that\nnailed his bones together again. Then, one morning, he had awakened,\nfeeling like a new being. He was born a second time, freed of all that\nhis five-and-twenty years of life had successively implanted in him. His\nchildish piety, his education at the seminary, the faith of his early\npriesthood, had all vanished, had been carried off, and their place was\nbare and empty. In truth, it could be hell alone that had thus prepared\nhim for the reception of evil, disarming him of all his former weapons,\nand reducing his body to languor and softness, through which sin might\nreadily enter.\n\nHe, perfectly unconscious of it all, unknowingly surrendered himself\nto the gradual approach of evil. When he had reopened his eyes in the\nParadou, he had felt himself an infant once more, with no memory of the\npast, no knowledge of his priesthood. He experienced a gentle pleasure,\na glad feeling of surprise at thus beginning life afresh, as though it\nwere all new and strange to him and would be delightful to learn. Oh!\nthe sweet apprenticeship, the charming observations, the delicious\ndiscoveries! That Paradou was a vast abode of felicity; and hell, in\nplacing him there, had known full well that he would be defenceless.\nNever, in his first youth, had he known such enjoyment in growing. That\nfirst youth of his, when he now thought of it, seemed quite black and\ngloomy, graceless, wan and inactive, as if it had been spent far away\nfrom the sunlight.\n\nBut at the Paradou, how joyfully had he hailed the sun! How admiringly\nhad he gazed at the first tree, at the first flower, at the tiniest\ninsect he had seen, at the most insignificant pebble he had picked up!\nThe very stones charmed him. The horizon was a source of never-ending\namazement. One clear morning, the memory of which still filled his eyes,\nbringing back a perfume of jasmine, a lark\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clear song, he had been so\naffected by emotion that he felt all power desert his limbs. He had long\nfound pleasure in learning the sensations of life. And, ah! the morning\nwhen Albine had been born beside him amidst the roses! As he thought of\nit, an ecstatic smile broke out upon his face. She rose up like a\nstar that was necessary to the very sun\u00e2\u0080\u0099s existence. She illumined\neverything, she made everything clear. She made his life complete.\n\nThen in fancy he once again walked with her through the Paradou. He\nremembered the little curls that waved behind her neck as she ran on\nbefore him. She exhaled delicious scent, and the touch of her warm\nswaying skirts seemed like a caress. And when she clasped him with her\nsupple curving arms, he half expected to see her, so slight and slender\nshe was, twine herself around him. It was she who went foremost. She led\nhim through winding paths, where they loitered, that their walk might\nlast the longer. It was she who instilled into him love for nature; and\nit was by watching the loves of the plants that he had learned to love\nher, with a love that was long, indeed, in bursting into life, but whose\nsweetness had been theirs at last. Beneath the shade of the giant tree\nthey had reached their journey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goal. Oh! to clasp her once again--yet\nonce again!\n\nA low groan suddenly came from the priest. He hastily sprang up and then\nflung himself down again. Temptation had just assailed him afresh. Into\nwhat paths were his recollections leading him? Did he not know, only\ntoo well, that Satan avails himself of every wile to insinuate\nhis serpent-head into the soul, even when it is absorbed in\nself-examination? No! no! he had no excuse. His illness had in no wise\nauthorised him to sin. He should have set strict guard upon himself,\nand have sought God anew upon recovering from his fever. And what a\nfrightful proof he now had of his vileness: he was not even able to\nmake calm confession of his sin. Would he never be able to silence his\nnature? He wildly thought of scooping his brains out of his skull that\nhe might be able to think no more, and of opening his veins that his\nblood might no longer torment him. For a moment he buried his face\nwithin his hands, shuddering as though the beasts that he felt prowling\naround him might infect him with the hot breath of temptation.\n\nBut his thoughts strayed on in spite of himself, and his blood throbbed\nwildly in his very heart. Though he held his clenched fists to his eyes,\nhe still saw Albine, dazzling like a sun. Every effort that he made to\npress the vision from his sight only made her shine out before him with\nincreased brilliancy. Was God, then, utterly forsaking him, that he\ncould find no refuge from temptation? And, in spite of all his efforts\nto control his thoughts, he espied every tiny blade of grass that thrust\nitself up by Albine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s skirts; he saw a little thistle-flower fastened in\nher hair, against which he remembered that he had pricked his lips.\nEven the perfumed atmosphere of the Paradou floated round him, and\nwell-remembered sounds came back, the repeated call of a bird, then an\ninterval of hushed silence, then a sigh floating through the trees.\n\nWhy did not Heaven at once strike him dead with its lightning? That\nwould have been less cruel. It was with a voluptuous pang, like the\npangs which assail the damned, that he recalled his transgression. He\nshuddered when he again heard in his heart the abominable words that he\nhad spoken at Albine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feet. Their echoes were now accusing him before\nthe throne of God. He had acknowledged Woman as his sovereign. He had\nyielded to her as a slave, kissing her feet, longing to be the water she\ndrank and the bread she ate. He began to understand now why he could\nno longer recover self-control. God had given him over to Woman. But he\nwould chastise her, scourge her, break her very limbs to force her to\nlet him go! It was she who was the slave; she, the creature of impurity,\nto whom the Church should have denied a soul. Then he braced himself,\nand shook his fists at the vision of Albine; but his fists opened and\nhis hands glided along her shoulders in a loving caress, while his lips,\njust now breathing out anger and insult, pressed themselves to her hair,\nstammering forth words of adoration.\n\nAbbe Mouret opened his eyes again. The burning apparition of Albine\nvanished. It was sudden and unexpected solace. He was able to weep.\nTears flowed slowly and refreshingly down his cheeks, and he drew a long\nbreath, still fearing to move, lest the Evil One should again grip\nhim by the neck, for he yet thought that he heard the snarl of a beast\nbehind him. And then he found such pleasure in the cessation of his\nsufferings that his one thought was to prolong the enjoyment of it.\n\nOutside the rain had ceased falling. The sun was setting in a vast\ncrimson glow, which spread across the windows like curtains of\nrose-coloured satin. The church was quite warm and bright in the parting\nbreath of the sinking luminary. The priest thanked God for the respite\nHe had been pleased to vouchsafe to him. A broad ray of light, like a\nbeam of gold-dust, streamed through the nave and illumined the far end\nof the building, the clock, the pulpit, and the high altar. Perhaps the\nDivine grace was returning to him from heaven along that radiant path.\nHe watched with interest the atoms that came and went with prodigious\nspeed through the ray, like a swarm of busy messengers ever hastening\nwith news from the sun to the earth. A thousand lighted candles\nwould not have filled the church with such splendour. Curtains of\ncloth-of-gold seemed to hang behind the high altar; treasures of the\ngoldsmith\u00e2\u0080\u0099s art covered all the ledges; candle-holders arose in dazzling\nsheaves; censers glowed full of burning gems; sacred vases gleamed\nlike fiery comets; and around all there seemed to be a rain of luminous\nflowers amidst waving lacework--beds, bouquets, and garlands of roses,\nfrom whose expanding petals dropped showers of stars.\n\nNever had Abbe Mouret desired such magnificence for his poor church. He\nsmiled, and dreamt of how he might retain all that splendour there, and\nthen arrange it most effectively. He would have preferred to see the\ncurtains of cloth-of-gold hung rather higher; the vases, too, needed\nmore careful arrangement; and he thought that the bouquets of flowers\nmight be tied up more neatly, and the garlands be more regularly shaped.\nYet how wondrously magnificent it all was! He was the pontiff of a\nchurch of gold. Bishops, princes, princesses, arrayed in royal mantles,\nmultitudes of believers, bending to the ground, were coming to visit it,\nencamping in the valley, waiting for weeks at the door until they should\nbe able to enter. They kissed his feet, for even his feet had turned\nto gold, and worked miracles. The bath of gold mounted to his knees.\nA golden heart was beating within his golden breast, with so clear a\nmusical pulsation that the waiting crowds could hear it from outside.\nThen a feeling of overweening pride seized upon him. He was an idol.\nThe golden beam mounted still higher, the high altar was all ablaze\nwith glory, and the priest grew certain that the Divine grace must be\nreturning to him, such was his inward satisfaction. The fierce snarl\nbehind him had now grown gentle and coaxing, and he only felt on his\nshoulder a soft velvety pressure, as though some giant cat were lightly\ncaressing him.\n\nHe still pursued his reverie. Never before had he seen things under such\na favourable light. Everything seemed quite easy to him now that he once\nmore felt full of strength. Since Albine was waiting for him, he would\ngo and join her. It was only natural. On the previous morning he had\nmarried Fortune and Rosalie. The Church did not forbid marriages. He saw\nthat young couple again as they knelt before him, smiling and nudging\neach other while his hands were held over them in benediction. Then, in\nthe evening, they had shown him their room. Each word that he had spoken\nto them echoed loudly in his ear. He had told Fortune that God had sent\nhim a companion, because He did not wish man to live alone; and he had\ntold Rosalie that she must cleave to her husband, never leaving him,\nbut always acting as his obedient helpmate. But he had said these things\nalso for Albine and himself. Was she not his companion, his obedient\nhelpmate, whom God had sent to him that his manhood might not wither up\nin solitude? Besides, they had been joined the one to the other. He felt\nsurprised that he had not understood and recognised it at once; that he\nhad not gone away with her, as his duty plainly required that he should\nhave done. But he had quite made up his mind now; he would certainly\njoin her in the morning. He could be with her in half an hour. He would\ngo through the village, and take the road up the hill; it was much the\nshortest way. He could do what he pleased; he was the master, and no one\nwould presume to say anything to him. If any one looked at him, a wave\nof his hand would force them to bend their heads. He would live with\nAlbine. He would call her his wife. They would be very happy together.\n\nThe golden stream mounted still higher, and played amongst his fingers.\nAgain did he seem to be immersed in a bath of gold. He would take\nthe altar-vases away to ornament his house, he would keep up a fine\nestablishment, he would pay his servants with fragments of chalices\nwhich he could easily break with his fingers. He would hang his\nbridal-bed with the cloth-of-gold that draped the altar; and he would\ngive his wife for jewels the golden hearts and chaplets and crosses that\nhung from the necks of the Virgin and the saints. The church itself, if\nanother storey were added to it, would supply them with a palace. God\nwould have no objection to make since He had allowed them to love each\nother. And, besides, was it not he who was now God, with the people\nkissing his golden miracle-working feet?\n\nAbbe Mouret rose. He made that sweeping gesture of Jeanbernat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, that\nwide gesture of negation, that took in everything as far as the horizon.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There is nothing, nothing, nothing!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said. \u00e2\u0080\u0098God does not exist.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nA mighty shudder seemed to sweep through the church. The terrified\npriest turned deadly pale and listened. Who had spoken? Who was it that\nhad blasphemed? Suddenly the velvety caress, whose gentle pressure\nhe had felt upon his shoulder, turned fierce and savage: sharp talons\nseemed to be rending his flesh, and once more he felt his blood\nstreaming forth. Yet he remained on his feet, struggling against the\nsudden attack. He cursed and reviled the triumphant sin that sniggered\nand grinned round his temples, whilst all the hammers of the Evil One\nbattered at them. Why had he not been on his guard against Satan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nwiles? Did he not know full well that it was his habit to glide up\nsoftly with gentle paws that he might drive them like blades into the\nvery vitals of his victim?\n\nHis anger increased as he thought how he had been entrapped, like a mere\nchild. Was he destined, then, to be ever hurled to the ground, with sin\ncrouching victoriously on his breast? This time he had actually denied\nhis God. It was all one fatal descent. His transgression had destroyed\nhis faith, and then dogma had tottered. One single doubt of the\nflesh, pleading abomination, sufficed to sweep heaven away. The divine\nordinances irritated one; the divine mysteries made one smile. Then came\nother temptations and allurements; gold, power, unrestrained liberty,\nan irresistible longing for enjoyment, culminating in luxuriousness,\nsprawling on a bed of wealth and pride. And then God was robbed. His\nvessels were broken to adorn woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impurity. Ah! well, then, he was\ndamned. Nothing could make any difference to him now. Sin might speak\naloud. It was useless to struggle further. The monsters who had hovered\nabout his neck were battening on his vitals now. He yielded to them with\nhideous satisfaction. He shook his fists at the church. No; he believed\nno longer in the divinity of Christ; he believed no longer in the Holy\nTrinity; he believed in naught but himself, and his muscles and the\nappetites of his body. He wanted to live. He felt the necessity of being\na man. Oh! to speed along through the open air, to be lusty and strong,\nto owe obedience to no jealous master, to fell one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enemies with\nstones, to carry off the fair maidens that passed upon one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shoulders.\nHe would break out from that living tomb where cruel hands had thrust\nhim. He would awaken his manhood, which had only been slumbering. And\nmight he die of shame if he should find that it were really dead! And\nmight the Divinity be accursed if, by the touch of His finger, He had\nmade him different from the rest of mankind.\n\nThe priest stood erect, his mind all dazed and scared. He fancied that,\nat this fresh outburst of blasphemy, the church was falling down upon\nhim. The sunlight, which had poured over the high altar, had gradually\nspread and mounted the walls like ruddy fire. Flames soared and licked\nthe rafters, then died away in a sanguineous, ember-like glow. And all\nat once the church became quite black. It was as though the fires of the\nsetting sun had burst the roof asunder, pierced the walls, thrown open\nwide breaches on every side to some exterior foe. The gloomy framework\nseemed to shake beneath some violent assault. Night was coming on\nquickly.\n\nThen, in the far distance, the priest heard a gentle murmur rising from\nthe valley of Les Artaud. The time had been when he had not understood\nthe impassioned language of those burning lands, where writhed but\nknotted vine-stocks, withered almond-trees, and decrepit olives\nsprawling with crippled limbs. Protected by his ignorance, he had passed\nundisturbed through all that world of passion. But, to-day, his ear\ndetected the slightest sigh of the leaves that lay panting in the heat.\nAfar off, on the edge of the horizon, the hills, still hot with the\nsinking luminary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s farewell, seemed to set themselves in motion with the\ntramp of an army on the march. Nearer at hand, the scattered rocks,\nthe stones along the road, all the pebbles in the valley, throbbed and\nrolled as if possessed by a craving for motion. Then the tracts of ruddy\nsoil, the few fields that had been reduced to cultivation, seemed to\nheave and growl like rivers that had burst their banks, bearing along in\na blood-like flood the engenderings of seeds, the births of roots, the\nembraces of plants. Soon everything was in motion. The vine-branches\nappeared to crawl along like huge insects; the parched corn and the dry\ngrass formed into dense, lance-waving battalions; the trees stretched\nout their boughs like wrestlers making ready for a contest; the fallen\nleaves skipped forward; the very dust on the road rolled on. It was a\nmoving multitude reinforced by fresh recruits at every step; a legion,\nthe sound of whose coming went on in front of it; an outburst of\npassionate life, sweeping everything along in a mighty whirlwind of\nfruitfulness. And all at once the assault began. From the limits of\nthe horizon, the whole countryside, the hills and stones and fields and\ntrees, rushed upon the church. At the first shock, the building quivered\nand cracked. The walls were pierced and the tiles on the roof were\nthrown down. But the great Christ, although shaken, did not fall.\n\nA short respite followed. Outside, the voices sounded more angrily, and\nthe priest could now distinguish human ones amongst them. The Artauds,\nthose bastards who sprang up out of the rocky soil with the persistence\nof brambles, were now in their turn blowing a blast that reeked of\nteeming life. They had planted everywhere forests of humanity that\nswallowed up all around them. They came up to the church, they shattered\nthe door with a push, and threatened to block up the very nave with the\ninvading scions of their race. Behind them came the beasts; the oxen\nthat tried to batter down the walls with their horns, the flocks of\nasses, goats, and sheep, that dashed against the ruined church like\nliving waves, while swarms of wood-lice and crickets attacked the\nfoundations and reduced them to dust with their sawlike teeth. Yet\nagain, on the other side, there was Desiree\u00e2\u0080\u0099s poultry-yard, where the\ndunghill reeked with suffocating fumes. Here the big cock, Alexander,\nsounded the assault, and the hens loosened the stones with their beaks,\nand the rabbits burrowed under the very altars; whilst the pig, too\nfat to stir, grunted and waited till all the sacred ornaments should be\nreduced to warm ashes in which he might wallow at his ease.\n\nA great roar ascended, and a second assault was delivered. The\nvillagers, the animals, all that overflowing sea of life assailed the\nchurch with such impetuosity that the rafters bent and curved. This\ntime a part of the walls tottered and fell down, the ceiling shook,\nthe woodwork of the windows was carried away, and the grey mist of the\nevening streamed in through the frightful gaping breaches. The great\nChrist now only clung to His cross by the nail that pierced His left\nhand.\n\nA mighty shout hailed the downfall of the block of wall. Yet the church\nstill stood there firmly, in spite of the injuries it had received. It\noffered a stern, silent, unflinching resistance, clutching desperately\nto the tiniest stones of its foundations. It seemed as though, to keep\nitself from falling, it required only the support of its slenderest\npillar, which, by some miracle of equilibration, held up the gaping\nroof. Then Abbe Mouret beheld the rude plants of the plateau, the\ndreadful-looking growths that had become hard as iron amidst the\narid rocks, that were knotted like snakes and bossy with muscles, set\nthemselves to work. The rust-hued lichens gnawed away at the rough\nplasterwork like fiery leprosy. Then the thyme-plants thrust their roots\nbetween the bricks like so many iron wedges. The lavenders insinuated\nhooked fingers into the loosened stonework, and by slow persistent\nefforts tore the blocks asunder. The junipers, the rosemaries, the\nprickly holly bushes, climbed higher and battered the walls with\nirresistible blows; and even the grass, the grass whose dry blades\nslipped beneath the great door, stiffened itself into steel-like spears\nand made its way down the nave, where it forced up the flagstones with\npowerful levers. It was a victorious revolt, it was revolutionary nature\nconstructing barricades out of the overturned altars, and wrecking the\nchurch which had for centuries cast too deep a shadow over it. The\nother combatants had fallen back, and let the plants, the thyme and the\nlavender and the lichens, complete the overthrow of the building with\ntheir ceaseless little blows, their constant gnawing, which proved more\ndestructive than the heavier onslaught of the stronger assailants.\n\nThen, suddenly, the end came. The rowan-tree, whose topmost branches had\nalready forced their way through the broken windows under the vaulted\nroof, rushed in violently with its formidable stream of greenery. It\nplanted itself in the centre of the nave and grew there monstrously.\nIts trunk expanded till its girth became so colossal that it seemed as\nthough it would burst the church asunder like a girdle spanning it too\nclosely. Its branches shot out in knotted arms, each one of which broke\ndown a piece of the wall or thrust off a strip of the roof, and they\nwent on multiplying without cessation, each branch ramifying, till a\nfresh tree sprang out of each single knot, with such impetuosity of\ngrowth that the ruins of the church, pierced through and through like a\nsieve, flew into fragments, scattering a fine dust to the four quarters\nof the heavens.\n\nNow the giant tree seemed to reach the stars; its forest of branches was\na forest of legs, arms, and breasts full of sap; the long locks of women\nstreamed down from it; men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heads burst out from the bark; and up aloft\npairs of lovers, lying languid by the edges of their nests, filled the\nair with the music of their delights.\n\nA final blast of the storm which had broken over the church swept away\nthe dust of its remains: the pulpit and the confessional-box, which\nhad been ground into powder, the lacerated holy pictures, the shattered\nsacred vessels, all the litter at which the legion of sparrows that had\nonce dwelt amongst the tiles was eagerly pecking. The great Christ,\ntorn from the cross, hung for a moment from one of the streaming women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ncurls, and then was whirled away into the black darkness, in the depths\nof which it sank with a loud crash. The Tree of Life had pierced the\nheavens; it overtopped the stars.\n\nAbbe Mouret was filled with the mad joy of an accursed spirit at the\nsight before him. The church was vanquished; God no longer had a house.\nAnd thenceforward God could no longer trouble him. He was free to rejoin\nAlbine, since it was she who triumphed. He laughed at himself for having\ndeclared, an hour previously, that the church would swallow up the\nwhole earth with its shadow. The earth, indeed, had avenged itself\nby consuming the church. The mad laughter into which he broke had\nthe effect of suddenly awakening him from his hallucination. He\ngazed stupidly round the nave, which the evening shadows were slowly\ndarkening. Through the windows he could see patches of star-spangled\nsky; and he was about to stretch out his arms to feel the walls, when he\nheard Desiree calling to him from the vestry-passage:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Serge! Serge! Are you there? Why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you answer? I have been looking\nfor you for this last half-hour.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe came in; she was holding a lighted lamp; and the priest then saw\nthat the church was still standing. He could no longer understand\nanything, but remained in a horrible state of doubt betwixt the\nunconquerable church, springing up again from its ashes, and Albine, the\nall-powerful, who could shake the very throne of God by a single breath.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\nDesiree came up to him, full of merry chatter.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Are you there? Are you there?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she cried. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Why are you playing at\nhide-and-seek? I called out to you at the top of my voice at least a\ndozen times. I thought you must have gone out.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe pried into all the gloomy corners with an inquisitive glance, and\neven stepped up to the confessional-box, as though she had expected\nto surprise some one hiding there. Then she came back to Serge,\ndisappointed, and continued:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098So you are quite alone? Have you been asleep? What amusement do you\nfind in shutting yourself up all alone in the dark? Come along; it is\ntime we went to dinner.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe Abbe drew his feverish hands across his brow to wipe away the traces\nof the thoughts which he feared were plain for all the world to read. He\nfumbled mechanically at the buttons of his cassock, which seemed to him\nall disarranged. Then he followed his sister with stern-set face and\nnever a sign of emotion, stiffened by that priestly energy which throws\nthe dignity of sacerdotalism like a veil over the agonies of the flesh.\nDesiree did not even suspect that there was anything the matter with\nhim. She simply said as they entered the dining-room:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I have had such a good sleep; but you have been talking too much, and\nhave made yourself quite pale.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nIn the evening, after dinner, Brother Archangias came in to have his\ngame of cards with La Teuse. He was in a very merry mood that night;\nand, when the Brother was merry, it was his habit to prod La Teuse\nin the sides with his big fists, an attention which she returned by\nheartily boxing his ears. This skirmishing made them both laugh, with a\nlaughter that shook the very ceiling. The Brother, too, when he was in\nthese gay humours, would devise all kinds of pranks. He would try to\nsmash plates with his nose, and would offer to wager that he could break\nthrough the dining-room door in battering-ram fashion. He would also\nempty the snuff out of his box into the old servant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coffee, or would\nthrust a handful of pebbles down her neck. The merest trifle would give\nrise to these noisy outbursts of gaiety in the very midst of his wonted\nsurliness. Some little incident, at which nobody else laughed, often\nsufficed to throw him into a state of wild hilarity, make him stamp his\nfeet, twirl himself round like a top, and hold in his splitting sides.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What is it that makes you so gay to-night?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 La Teuse inquired.\n\nHe made no reply, bestriding a chair and galloping round the table on\nit.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well! well! go on making a baby of yourself!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the old woman; \u00e2\u0080\u0098and,\nmy gracious, what a big baby you are! If the Lord is looking at you, He\nmust be very well pleased with you!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe Brother had just slipped off the chair and was lying on the floor,\nwith his legs in the air.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He does see me, and is pleased to see me as I am. It is His wish that I\nshould be gay. When He wishes me to be merry for a time, He rings a bell\nin my body, and then I begin to roll about; and all Paradise smiles as\nit watches me.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe dragged himself on his back to the wall, and then, supporting himself\non the nape of his neck, he hoisted up his body as high as he could and\nbegan drumming on the wall with his heels. His cassock slipped down and\nexposed to view his black breeches, which were patched at the knees with\ngreen cloth.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Look, Monsieur le Cure,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098you see how high I can reach with\nmy heels. I dare bet that you couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do as much. Come! look amused and\nlaugh a little. It is better to drag oneself along on one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s back than to\nthink about a hussy as you are always doing. You know what I mean. For\nmy part, when I take to scratching myself I imagine myself to be God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ndog, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what makes me say that all Paradise looks out of the\nwindows to smile at me. You might just as well laugh too, Monsieur le\nCure. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all done for the saints and you. See! here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a turn-over for\nSaint Joseph; here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another for Saint Michael, and another for Saint\nJohn, and another for Saint Mark, and another for Saint Matthew----\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nSo he went on, enumerating a whole string of saints, and turning\nsomersaults all round the room.\n\nAbbe Mouret, who had been sitting in perfect silence, with his hands\nresting on the edge of the table, was at last constrained to smile. As\na rule, the Brother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sportiveness only disquieted him. La Teuse, as\nArchangias rolled within her reach, kicked at him with her foot.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Come!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098are we to have our game to-night?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHis only reply was a grunt. Then, upon all fours, he sprang towards La\nTeuse as if he meant to bite her. But in lieu thereof he spat upon her\npetticoats.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Let me alone! will you?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she cried. \u00e2\u0080\u0098What are you up to now? I begin\nto think you have gone crazy. What it is that amuses you so much I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nconceive.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What makes me gay is my own affair,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he replied, rising to his feet and\nshaking himself. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It is not necessary to explain it to you, La Teuse.\nHowever, as you want a game of cards, let us have it.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen the game began. It was a terrible struggle. The Brother hurled\nhis cards upon the table. Whenever he cried out the windows shook\nsonorously. La Teuse at last seemed to be winning. She had secured three\naces for some time already, and was casting longing eyes at the fourth.\nBut Brother Archangias began to indulge in fresh outbursts of gaiety.\nHe pushed up the table, at the risk of breaking the lamp. He cheated\noutrageously, and defended himself by means of the most abominable\nlies, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Just for a joke,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said he. Then he suddenly began to sing the\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Vespers,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 beating time on the palm of his left hand with his cards.\nWhen his gaiety reached a climax, and he could find no adequate means\nof expressing it, he always took to chanting the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Vespers,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 which he\nrepeated for hours at a time. La Teuse, who well knew his habits, cried\nout to him, amidst the bellowing with which he shook the room:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Make a little less noise, do! It is quite distracting. You are much too\nlively to-night.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut he set to work on the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Complines.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Abbe Mouret had now seated\nhimself by the window. He appeared to pay no attention to what went on\naround him, apparently neither hearing nor seeing anything of it. At\ndinner he had eaten with his ordinary appetite and had even managed to\nreply to Desiree\u00e2\u0080\u0099s everlasting rattle of questions. But now he had given\nup the struggle, his strength at an end, racked, exhausted as he was\nby the internal tempest that still raged within him. He even lacked the\ncourage to rise from his seat and go upstairs to his own room. Moreover,\nhe was afraid that if he turned his face towards the lamplight, the\ntears, which he could no longer keep from his eyes, would be noticed. So\nhe pressed his face close to the window and gazed out into the darkness,\ngrowing gradually more drowsy, sinking into a kind of nightmare stupor.\n\nBrother Archangias, still busy at his psalm-singing, winked and nodded\nin the direction of the dozing priest.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the matter?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 asked La Teuse.\n\nThe Brother replied by a yet more significant wink.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, what do you mean? Can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you speak? Ah! there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a king. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ncapital!--so I take your queen.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe Brother laid down his cards, bent over the table, and whispered\nclose to La Teuse\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face: \u00e2\u0080\u0098That hussy has been here.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I know that well enough,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 answered La Teuse. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I saw her go with\nmademoiselle into the poultry-yard.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAt this he gave her a terrible look, and shook his fist in her face.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You saw her, and you let her come in! You ought to have called me, and\nwe would have hung her up by the feet to a nail in your kitchen.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut at this the old woman lost her temper, and, lowering her voice\nsolely in order that she might not awaken Abbe Mouret, she replied:\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you go talking about hanging people up in my kitchen! I certainly\nsaw her, and I even kept my back turned when she went to join his\nreverence in the church when the catechising was over. But all that\nwas no business of mine. I had my cooking to attend to! As for the girl\nherself, I detest her. But if his reverence wishes to see her--why, she\nis welcome to come whenever she pleases. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d let her in myself!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098If you were to do that, La Teuse,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 retorted the Brother ragefully, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I\nwould strangle you, that I would.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut she laughed at him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t talk any of your nonsense to me, my man! Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you know that it\nis forbidden you to lay your hands upon a woman, just as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s forbidden\nfor a donkey to have anything to do with the _Pater Noster_? Just you\ntry to strangle me and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do! But do be quiet now, and\nlet us finish the game. See, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another king.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut the Brother, holding up a card, went on growling:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098She must have come by some road that the devil alone knows for me to\nhave missed her to-day. Every afternoon I go and keep guard up yonder\nby the Paradou. If ever I find them together again, I will acquaint\nthe hussy with a stout dogwood stick which I have cut expressly for her\nbenefit. And I shall keep a watch in the church as well now.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe played his card, which La Teuse took with a knave. Then he threw\nhimself back in his chair and again burst into one of his loud laughs.\nHe did not seem to be able to work himself up into a genuine rage that\nevening.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, well,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he grumbled, \u00e2\u0080\u0098never mind, even if she did see him, she had\na smacking fall on her nose. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell you all about it, La Teuse. It\nwas raining, you know. I was standing by the school-door when I caught\nsight of her coming down from the church. She was walking along quite\nstraight and upright, in her stuck-up fashion, in spite of the pouring\nrain. But when she got into the road, she tumbled down full length, no\ndoubt because the ground was so slippery. Oh! how I did laugh! How I did\nlaugh! I clapped my hands, too. When she picked herself up again, I saw\nshe was bleeding at the wrist. I shall feel happy over it for a week.\nI cannot think of her lying there on the ground without feeling the\ngreatest delight.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen, turning his attention to the game, he puffed out his cheeks and\nbegan to chant the _De profundis_. When he had got to the end of it, he\nbegan it all over again. The game came to a conclusion in the midst of\nthis dirge. It was he who was beaten, but his defeat did not seem to vex\nhim in the least.\n\nWhen La Teuse had locked the door behind him, after first awakening Abbe\nMouret, his voice could still be heard, as he went his way through\nthe black night, singing the last verse of the psalm, _Et ipse redimet\nIsrael ex omnibus iniquitatibus ejus_, with extraordinary jubilation.\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\nThat night Abbe Mouret slept very heavily. When he opened his eyes in\nthe morning, later than usual, his face and hands were wet with tears.\nHe had been weeping all through the night while he slept. He did not say\nhis mass that day. In spite of his long rest, he had not recovered from\nhis excessive weariness of the previous evening, and he remained in\nhis bedroom till noon, sitting in a chair at the foot of his bed. The\ncondition of stupor into which he more and more deeply sank, took all\nsensation of suffering away from him. He was conscious only of a great\nvoid and blank as he sat there overpowered and benumbed. Even to\nread his breviary cost him a great effort. Its Latin seemed to him a\nbarbarous language, which he would never again be able to pronounce.\n\nHaving tossed the book upon his bed he gazed for hours through his open\nwindow at the surrounding country. In the far distance he saw the long\nwall of the Paradou, creeping like a thin white line amongst the gloomy\npatches of the pine plantations to the crest of the hills. On the left,\nhidden by one of those plantations, was the breach. He could not see it,\nbut he knew it was there. He remembered every bit of bramble scattered\namong the stones. On the previous night he would not have thus dared to\ngaze upon that dreaded scene. But now with impunity he allowed himself\nto trace the whole line of the wall, as it emerged again and again\nfrom the clumps of verdure which here and there concealed it. His\nblood pulsed none the faster for this scrutiny. Temptation, as though\ndisdaining his present weakness, left him free from attack. Forsaken by\nthe Divine grace, he was incapable of entering upon any struggle, the\nthought of sin could no longer even impassion him; it was sheer stupor\nalone that now rendered him willing to accept that which he had the day\nbefore so strenuously refused.\n\nAt one moment he caught himself talking aloud and saying that, since\nthe breach in the wall was still open, he would go and join Albine at\nsunset. This decision brought him a slight feeling of worry, but he did\nnot think that he could do otherwise. She was expecting him to go,\nand she was his wife. When he tried to picture her face, he could only\nimagine her as very pale and a long way off. Then he felt a little\nuneasy as to their future manner of life together. It would be difficult\nfor them to remain in the neighbourhood; they would have to go away\nsomewhere, without any one knowing anything about it. And then, when\nthey had managed to conceal themselves, they would need a deal of money\nin order to live happily and comfortably. He tried a score of times to\nhit upon some scheme by which they could get away and live together like\nhappy lovers, but he could devise nothing satisfactory. Now that he was\nno longer wild with passion, the practical side of the situation\nalarmed him. He found himself, in all his weakness, face to face with a\ncomplicated problem with which he was incompetent to grapple.\n\nWhere could they get horses for their escape? And if they went away\non foot, would they not be stopped and detained as vagabonds? Was he\ncapable of securing any employment by which he could earn bread for his\nwife? He had never been taught any kind of trade. He was quite ignorant\nof actual life. He ransacked his memory, and he could remember nothing\nbut strings of prayers, details of ceremonies, and pages of Bouvier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Instruction Theologique,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 which he had learned by heart at the\nseminary. He worried too over matters of no real concern. He asked\nhimself whether he would dare to give his arm to his wife in the street.\nHe certainly could not walk with a woman clinging to his arm. He would\nsurely appear so strange and awkward that every one would turn round\nto stare at him. They would guess that he was a priest and would insult\nAlbine. It would be vain for him to try to obliterate the traces of\nhis priesthood. He would always wear that mournful pallor and carry the\nodour of incense about with him. And what if he should have children\nsome day? As this thought suddenly occurred to him, he quite started. He\nfelt a strange repugnance at the very idea. He felt sure that he should\nnot care for any children that might be born to him. Suppose there were\ntwo of them, a little boy and a little girl. He could never let them get\non his knees; it would distress him to feel their hands clutching at his\nclothes. The thought of the little girl troubled him the most; he\ncould already see womanly tenderness shining in the depths of her big,\nchildish eyes. No! no! he would have no children.\n\nNevertheless he resolved that he would flee with Albine that evening.\nBut when the evening came, he felt too weary. So he deferred his flight\ntill the next morning. And the next morning he made a fresh pretext\nfor delay. He could not leave his sister alone with La Teuse. He would\nprepare a letter, directing that she should be taken to her uncle\nPascal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. For three days he was ever on the point of writing that\nletter, and the paper and pen and ink were lying ready on the table\nin his room. Then, on the third day, he went off, leaving the letter\nunwritten. He took up his hat quite suddenly and set off for the\nParadou in a state of mingled stupor and resignation, as though he were\nunwillingly performing some compulsory task which he saw no means of\navoiding. Albine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s image was now effaced from his memory; he no longer\nbeheld her, but he was driven on by old resolves whose lingering\ninfluence, though they themselves were dead, still worked upon him in\nhis silence and loneliness.\n\nHe took no pains to escape notice when he set foot out of doors. He\nstopped at the end of the village to talk for a moment to Rosalie. She\ntold him that her baby was suffering from convulsions; but she laughed,\nas she spoke, with the laugh that was natural to her. Then he struck\nout through the rocks, and walked straight on towards the breach in the\nwall. By force of habit he had brought his breviary with him. Finding\nthe way long, he opened the book and read the regulation prayers. When\nhe put it back again under his arm, he had forgotten the Paradou. He\nwent on walking steadily, thinking about a new chasuble that he wished\nto purchase to replace the old gold-broidered one, which was certainly\nfalling into shreds. For some time past he had been saving up\ntwenty-sous pieces, and he calculated that by the end of seven months\nhe would have got the necessary amount of money together. He had reached\nthe hills when the song of a peasant in the distance reminded him of\na canticle which had been familiar to him at the seminary. He tried to\nrecall the first lines of it, but his recollection failed him. It vexed\nhim to find that his memory was so poor. And when, at last, he succeeded\nin remembering the words, he found a soothing pleasure in humming the\nverses, which came back to his mind one by one. It was a hymn of homage\nto Mary. He smiled as though some soft breath from the days of his\nchildhood were playing upon his face. Ah! how happy he had then been!\nWhy shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t he be as happy again? He had not grown any bigger, he\nwanted nothing more than the same old happiness, unruffled peace, a nook\nin the chapel, where his knees marked his place, a life of seclusion,\nenlivened by the delightful puerilities of childhood. Little by little\nhe raised his voice, singing the canticle in flutelike tones, when he\nsuddenly became aware of the breach immediately in front of him.\n\nFor a moment he seemed surprised. Then, the smile dying from his face,\nhe murmured quietly:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Albine must be expecting me. The sun is already setting.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut just as he was about to push some stones aside to make himself a\npassage, he was startled by a snore. He sprang down again: he had only\njust missed setting his foot upon the very face of Brother Archangias,\nwho was lying on the ground there sleeping soundly. Slumber had\novertaken him while he kept guard over the entrance to the Paradou. He\nbarred the approach to it, lying at full length before its threshold,\nwith arms and legs spread out. His right hand, thrown back behind his\nhead, still clutched his dogwood staff, which he seemed to brandish like\na fiery sword. And he snored loudly in the midst of the brambles, his\nface exposed to the sun, without a quiver on his tanned skin. A swarm of\nbig flies was hovering over his open mouth.\n\nAbbe Mouret looked at him for a moment. He envied the slumber of that\ndust-wallowing saint. He wished to drive the flies away, but they\npersistently returned, and clung around the purple lips of the Brother,\nwho was quite unconscious of their presence. Then the Abbe strode over\nhis big body and entered the Paradou.\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\nAlbine was seated on a patch of grass a few paces away from the wall.\nShe sprang up as she caught sight of Serge.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! you have come!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she cried, trembling from head to foot.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he answered calmly, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I have come.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe flung herself upon his neck, but she did not kiss him. To her bare\narms the beads of his neckband seemed very cold. She scrutinised him,\nalready feeling uneasy, and resuming:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What is the matter with you? Why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you kiss my cheeks as you used\nto do? Oh! if you are ill, I will cure you once again. Now that you\nare here, all our old happiness will return. There will be no more\nwretchedness.... See! I am smiling. You must smile, too, Serge.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut his face remained grave.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I have been troubled, too,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she went on. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I am still quite pale, am I\nnot? For a whole week I have been living on that patch of grass, where\nyou found me. I wanted one thing only, to see you coming back through\nthe breach in the wall. At every sound I sprang up and rushed to meet\nyou. But, alas! it was not you I heard. It was only the leaves rustling\nin the wind. But I was sure that you would come. I should have waited\nfor you for years.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen she asked him:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Do you still love me?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he answered, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I love you still.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThey stood looking at each other, feeling rather ill at ease. And deep\nsilence fell between them. Serge, who evinced perfect calmness, did not\nattempt to break it. Albine twice opened her mouth to speak, but closed\nit immediately, surprised at the words that rose to her lips. She could\nsummon up nothing but expressions tinged with bitterness. She felt tears\nwelling into her eyes. What could be the matter with her that she did\nnot feel happy now that her love had come back?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Listen to me,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said at last. \u00e2\u0080\u0098We must not stay here. It is that\nhole that freezes us! Let us go back to our old home. Give me your\nhand.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThey plunged into the depths of the Paradou. Autumn was fast\napproaching, and the trees seemed anxious as they stood there with their\nyellowing crests from which the leaves were falling one by one. The\npaths were already littered with dead foliage soaked with moisture,\nwhich gave out a sound as of sighing beneath one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tread. And away\nbeyond the lawns misty vapour ascended, throwing a mourning veil over\nthe blue distance. And the whole garden was wrapped in silence, broken\nonly by some sorrowful moans that sounded quiveringly.\n\nSerge began to shiver beneath the avenue of tall trees, along which they\nwere walking.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098How cold it is here!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said he in an undertone.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You are cold indeed,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 murmured Albine, sadly. \u00e2\u0080\u0098My hand is no longer\nable to warm you. Shall I wrap you round with part of my dress? Come,\nall our love will now be born afresh.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe led him to the parterre, the flower-garden. The great thicket-like\nrosary was still fragrant with perfume, but there was a tinge of\nbitterness in the scent of the surviving blossoms, and their foliage,\nwhich had expanded in wild profusion, lay strewn upon the ground. Serge\ndisplayed such unwillingness to enter the tangled jungle, that they\nlingered on its borders, trying to detect in the distance the paths\nalong which they had passed in the spring-time. Albine recollected\nevery little nook. She pointed to the grotto where the marble woman lay\nsleeping; to the hanging screens of honeysuckle and clematis; the fields\nof violets; the fountain that spurted out crimson carnations; the steps\ndown which flowed golden gilliflowers; the ruined colonnade, in the\nmidst of which the lilies were rearing a snowy pavilion. It was\nthere that they had been born again beneath the sunlight. And she\nrecapitulated every detail of that first day together, how they had\nwalked, and how fragrant had been the air beneath the cool shade. Serge\nseemed to be listening, but he suddenly asked a question which showed\nthat he had not understood her. The slight shiver which made his face\nturn pale never left him.\n\nThen she led him towards the orchard, but they could not reach it. The\nstream was too much swollen. Serge no longer thought of taking Albine\nupon his back and lightly bounding across with her to the other side.\nYet there the apple-trees and the pear-trees were still laden with\nfruit, and the vines, now with scantier foliage, bent beneath the weight\nof their gleaming clusters, each grape freckled by the sun\u00e2\u0080\u0099s caress.\nAh! how they had gambolled beneath the appetising shade of those ancient\ntrees! What merry children had they then been! Albine smiled as she\nthought of how she had clambered up into the cherry-tree that had broken\ndown beneath her. He, Serge, must at least remember what a quantity of\nplums they had eaten. He only answered by a nod. He already seemed quite\nweary. The orchard, with its green depths and chaos of mossy trunks,\ndisquieted him and suggested to his mind some dark, dank spot, teeming\nwith snakes and nettles.\n\nThen she led him to the meadow-lands, where he had to take a few steps\namongst the grass. It reached to his shoulders now, and seemed to him\nlike a swarm of clinging arms that tried to bind his limbs and pull him\ndown and drown him beneath an endless sea of greenery. He begged Albine\nto go no further. She was walking on in front, and at first she did not\nstop; but when she saw how distressed he appeared, she halted and\ncame back and stood beside him. She also was growing gradually more\nlow-spirited, and at last she shuddered like himself. Still she went on\ntalking. With a sweeping gesture she pointed out to him the streams,\nthe rows of willows, the grassy expanse stretching far away towards\nthe horizon. All that had formerly been theirs. For whole days they had\nlived there. Over yonder, between those three willows by the water\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nedge, they had played at being lovers. And they would then have been\ndelighted if the grass had been taller than themselves so that they\nmight have lost themselves in its depths, and have been the more\nsecluded, like larks nesting at the bottom of a field of corn. Why,\nthen, did he tremble so to-day, when the tip of his foot just sank into\nthe grass?\n\nThen she led him to the forest. But the huge trees seemed to inspire\nSerge with still greater dread. He did not know them again, so sternly\nsolemn seemed their bare black trunks. Here, more than anywhere else,\namidst those austere columns, through which the light now freely\nstreamed, the past seemed quite dead. The first rains had washed the\ntraces of their footsteps from the sandy paths, the winds had swept\nevery other lingering memorial into the underbrush. But Albine, with\ngrief at her throat, shot out a protesting glance. She could still\nplainly see their lightest footprints on the sandy gravel, and, as they\npassed each bush, the warmth with which they had once brushed against it\nsurged to her cheeks. With eyes full of soft entreaty, she still strove\nto awaken Serge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s memory. It was along that path that they had walked\nin silence, full of emotion, but as yet not daring to confess that they\nloved one another. It was in that clearing that they had lingered one\nevening till very late watching the stars, which had rained upon\nthem like golden drops of warmth. Farther, beneath that oak they had\nexchanged their first kiss. Its fragrance still clung to the tree, and\nthe very moss still remembered it. It was false to say that the forest\nhad become voiceless and bare.\n\nSerge, however, turned away his head, that he might escape the gaze of\nAlbine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes, which oppressed him.\n\nThen she led him to the great rocks. There, perhaps, he would no longer\nshudder with that appearance of debility which so distressed her. At\nthat hour the rocks were still warm with the red glow of the setting\nsun. They still wore an aspect of tragic passion, with their hot ledges\nof stone whereon the fleshy plants writhed monstrously. Without speaking\na word, without even turning her head, Albine led Serge up the rough\nascent, wishing to take him ever higher and higher, far up beyond the\nsprings, till they should emerge into the full light on the summit. They\nwould there see the cedar, beneath whose shade they had first felt\nthe thrill of desire, and there amidst the glowing stones they would\nassuredly find passion once more. But Serge soon began to stumble\npitiably. He could walk no further. He fell a first time on his knees.\nAlbine, by a mighty effort, raised him and for a moment carried him\nalong, but afterwards he fell again, and remained, quite overcome, on\nthe ground. In front of him, beneath him, spread the vast Paradou.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You have lied!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cried Albine. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You love me no longer!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe burst into tears as she stood there by his side, feeling that she\ncould not carry him any higher. There was no sign of anger in her\nnow. She was simply weeping over their dying love. Serge lay dazed and\nstupefied.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The garden is all dead. I feel so very cold,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he murmured. But she took\nhis head between her hands, and showed him the Paradou.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Look at it! Ah! it is your eyes that are dead; your ears and your limbs\nand your whole body. You have passed by all the scenes of our happiness\nwithout seeing them or hearing them or feeling their presence. You have\ndone nothing but slip and stumble, and now you have fallen down here in\nsheer weariness and boredom.... You love me no more.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe protested, but in a gentle, quiet fashion. Then, for the first time,\nshe spoke out passionately.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Be quiet! As if the garden could ever die! It will sleep for the\nwinter, but it will wake up again in May, and will restore to us all\nthe love we have entrusted to its keeping. Our kisses will blossom again\namongst the flower-beds, and our vows will bud again with the trees and\nplants. If you could only see it and understand it, you would know that\nit throbs with even deeper passion, and loves even more absorbingly at\nthis autumn-time, when it falls asleep in its fruitfulness.... But you\nlove me no more, and so you can no longer understand.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe raised his eyes to her as if begging her not to be angry. His face\nwas pinched and pale with an expression of childish fear. The sound of\nher voice made him tremble. He ended by persuading her to rest a little\nwhile by his side. They could talk quietly and discuss matters. Then,\nwith the Paradou spreading out in front of them, they began to speak of\ntheir love, but without even touching one another\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fingers.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I love you; indeed I love you,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Serge, in his calm, quiet voice.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098If I did not love you, I should not be here: I should not have come.\nI am very weary, it is true. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know why. I thought I should find\nthat pleasant warmth again, of which the mere memory was so delightful.\nBut I am cold, the garden seems quite black. I cannot see anything of\nwhat I left here. But it is not my fault. I am trying hard to be as you\nwould wish me and to please you.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You love me no longer!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Albine repeated once more.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes, I do love you. I suffered grievously the other day after I had\ndriven you away.... Oh! I loved you with such passion that, had you come\nback and thrown yourself in my arms, I should almost have crushed you\nto death.... And for hours your image remained present before me. When\nI shut my eyes, you gleamed out with all the brightness of the sun and\nthrew a flame around me.... Then I trampled down every obstacle, and\ncame here.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe remained silent for a moment, as if in thought. Then he spoke again:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And now my arms feel as though they were broken. If I tried to clasp\nyou, I could not hold you; I should let you fall.... Wait till this\nshudder has passed away. Give me your hands, and let me kiss them again.\nBe gentle and do not look at me with such angry eyes. Help me to find my\nheart again.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe spoke with such genuine sadness, such evident longing to begin\nthe past anew, that Albine was touched. For a moment all her wonted\ngentleness returned to her, and she questioned him anxiously:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What is the matter with you? What makes you so ill?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I do not know. It is as though all my blood had left my veins. Just\nnow, as I was coming here, I felt as if some one had flung a robe of ice\naround my shoulders, which turned me into stone from head to foot.... I\nhave felt it before, but where I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remember.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe interrupted him with a kindly laugh.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You are a child. You have caught cold, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all. At any rate, it is\nnot I that you are afraid of, is it? We won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop in the garden during\nthe winter, like a couple of wild things. We will go wherever you like,\nto some big town. We can love each other there, amongst all the people,\nas quietly as amongst the trees. You will see that I can be something\nelse than a wilding, for ever bird\u00e2\u0080\u0099s-nesting and tramping about for\nhours. When I was a little girl, I used to wear embroidered skirts and\nfine stockings and laces and all kinds of finery. I dare say you never\nheard of that.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe was not listening to her. He suddenly gave vent to a little cry, and\nsaid: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! now I recollect!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe asked him what he meant, but he would not answer her. He had just\nremembered the feeling he had long ago experienced in the chapel of the\nseminary. That was the icy robe enwrapping his shoulders and turning him\nto stone. And then his life as a priest took complete possession of his\nthoughts. The vague recollections which had haunted him as he walked\nfrom Les Artaud to the Paradou became more and more distinct and assumed\ncomplete mastery over him. While Albine talked on of the happy life that\nthey would lead together, he heard the tinkling of the sanctuary bell\nthat signalled the elevation of the Host, and he saw the monstrance\ntrace gleaming crosses over the heads of kneeling multitudes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And for your sake,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Albine was saying, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I will put on my broidered\nskirts again.... I want you to be bright and gay. We will try to find\nsomething to make you lively. Perhaps you will love me better when you\nsee me looking beautiful and prettily dressed, like a fine lady. I will\nwear my comb properly and won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let my hair fall wildly about my neck\nany more. And I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t roll my sleeves up over my elbows; I will fasten\nmy dress so as to hide my shoulders. I still know how to bow and how to\nwalk along quite properly. Yes, I will make you a nice little wife, as I\nwalk through the streets leaning on your arm.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Did you ever go to church when you were a little girl?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he asked her in\nan undertone, as if, in spite of himself, he were continuing aloud the\nreverie which prevented him from hearing her. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I could never pass a\nchurch without entering it. As soon as the door closed silently\nbehind me, I felt as though I were in Paradise itself, with the angels\nwhispering stories of love in my ears and the saints caressing me with\ntheir breath. Ah! I would have liked to live there for ever, in that\nabsorbing beatitude.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe looked at him with steady eyes, a passing blaze kindling in her\nloving glance. Nevertheless, submissive still, she answered:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I will do as you may fancy. I learned music once. I was quite a clever\nyoung lady and was taught all the accomplishments. I will go back to\nschool and start music again. If there is any tune you would like to\nhear me play, you will only have to tell me, and I will practise it for\nmonths and months, so as to play it to you some evening in our own home\nwhen we are by ourselves in some snug little room, with the curtains\nclosely drawn. And you will pay me with just one kiss, won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you? A kiss\nright on the lips, which will awaken all your love again!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes, yes,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he murmured, answering his own thoughts only; \u00e2\u0080\u0098my great\npleasure at first was to light the candles, prepare the cruets, and\ncarry the missal. Then, afterwards, I was filled with bliss at the\napproach of God, and felt as though I could die of sheer love. Those are\nmy only recollections. I know of nothing else. When I raise my hand, it\nis to give a benediction. When my lips protrude it is to kiss the altar.\nIf I look for my heart, I can no longer find it. I have offered it to\nGod, and He has taken it.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAlbine grew very pale and her eyes gleamed like fire. In a quivering\nvoice she resumed:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I should not like my little girl to leave me. You can send the boy to\ncollege, if you wish, but the little girl must always keep with me. I\nmyself will teach her to read. Oh! I shall remember everything, and\nif indeed there be anything that I find I have forgotten, I will have\nmasters to teach me.... Yes, we will keep our dear little ones always\nabout our knees. You will be happy so, won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you? Speak to me; tell me\nthat you will then feel warm again, and will smile, and feel no regrets\nfor anything you have left behind.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut Serge continued:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I have often thought of the stone-saints that have been censed in their\nniches for centuries past. They must have become quite saturated with\nincense; and I am like one of them. I have the fragrance of incense\nin the inmost parts of my being. It is that embalmment that gives me\nserenity, deathlike tranquillity of body, and the peace which I enjoy in\nno longer living.... Ah! may nothing ever disturb my quiescence! May I\never remain cold and rigid, with a ceaseless smile on my granite lips,\nincapable of descending among men! That is my one, my only desire!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAt this Albine sprang to her feet, exasperated, threatening. She shook\nSerge and cried:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What are you saying? What is it you are dreaming aloud? Am I not your\nwife? Haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you come here to be my husband?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe recoiled, trembling yet more violently.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No! Leave me! I am afraid!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he faltered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But our life together, our happiness, the children we shall have?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No, no; I am afraid.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And he broke out into a supreme cry: \u00e2\u0080\u0098I cannot! I\ncannot!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nFor a moment Albine remained silent, gazing at the unhappy man who lay\nshivering at her feet. Her face flared. She opened her arms as if to\nseize him and strain him to her breast with wild angry passion. But\nanother idea came to her, and she merely took him by the hand and raised\nhim to his feet.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Come!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said she.\n\nShe led him away to that giant tree, to the very spot where their love\nhad reigned supreme. There was the same bliss-inspiring shade, there was\nthe same trunk as of yore, the same branches spreading far around, like\nsheltering and protecting arms. The tree still towered aloft, kindly,\nrobust, powerful, and fertile. As on the day of their nuptials,\nlanguorous warmth, the glimmer of a summer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s night fading on the bare\nshoulder of some fair girl, a sob of love dying away into passionate\nsilence, lingered about the clearing as it lay there bathed in dim green\nlight. And, in the distance, the Paradou, in spite of the first\nchills of autumn, sighed once more with passion, again becoming love\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\naccomplice. From the parterre, from the orchard, from the meadow-lands,\nfrom the forest, from the great rocks, from the spreading heavens,\ncame back a ripple of voluptuous joy. Never had the garden, even on the\nwarmest evenings of spring-time, shown such deep tenderness as now, on\nthis fair autumn evening, when the plants and trees seemed to be bidding\none another goodnight ere they sank to sleep. And the scent of ripened\ngerms wafted the intoxication of desire athwart the scanty leaves.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Do you hear? Do you hear?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 faltered Albine in Serge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ear, when she had\nlet him slip upon the grass at the foot of the tree.\n\nSerge was weeping.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You see that the Paradou is not dead,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she added. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It is crying out\nto us to love each other. It still desires our union. Oh, do remember!\nClasp me to your heart!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nSerge still wept.\n\nAlbine said nothing more. She flung her arms around him; she pressed her\nwarm lips to his corpse-like face; but tears were still his only answer.\n\nThen, after a long silence, Albine spoke. She stood erect, full of\ncontempt and determination.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Away with you! Go!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said, in a low voice.\n\nSerge rose with difficulty. He picked up his breviary, which had fallen\nupon the grass. And he walked away.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Away with you! Go!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 repeated Albine, in louder tones, as she followed\nand drove him before her.\n\nThus she urged him on from bush to bush till she had driven him back\nto the breach in the wall, in the midst of the stern-looking trees.\nAnd there, as she saw Serge hesitate, with lowered head she cried out\nviolently:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Away with you Go!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAnd slowly she herself went back into the Paradou, without even turning\nher head. Night was fast falling, and the garden was but a huge bier of\nshadows.\n\n\n\n\nXIII\n\nBrother Archangias, aroused from his slumber, stood erect in the breach,\nstriking the stones with his stick and swearing abominably.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098May the devil break their legs for them! May he drag them to hell by\ntheir feet, with their noses trailing in their abomination!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut when he saw Albine driving away the priest, he stopped for a moment\nin surprise. Then he struck the stones yet more vigorously, and burst\ninto a roar of laughter.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Good-bye, you hussy! A pleasant journey to you! Go back to your mates\nthe wolves! A priest is no fit companion for such as you.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen, looking at Abbe Mouret, he growled:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I knew you were in there. I saw that the stones had been disturbed....\nListen to me, Monsieur le Cure. Your sin has made me your superior, and\nGod tells you, through my mouth, that hell has no torments severe enough\nfor a priest who lets himself succumb to the lusts of the flesh. If He\nwere to pardon you now, He would be too indulgent, it would be contrary\nto His own justice.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThey slowly walked down the hill towards Les Artaud. The priest had\nnot opened his lips; but gradually he raised his head erect: he was no\nlonger trembling. As in the distance he caught sight of the Solitaire\nlooming blackly against the purplish sky, and the ruddy glow of the\ntiles on the church, a faint smile came to his lips, while to his calm\neyes there rose an expression of perfect serenity.\n\nMeantime the Brother was every now and then giving a vicious kick at the\nstones that came in his way. Presently he turned to his companion:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Is it all over this time?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he asked. \u00e2\u0080\u0098When I was your age I was\npossessed too. A demon was ever gnawing at me. But, after a time, he\ngrew weary of it, and took himself off. Now that he has gone I live\nquietly enough.... Oh! I knew very well that you would go. For three\nweeks past I have been keeping watch upon you. I used to look into the\ngarden through the breach in the wall. I should have liked to cut the\ntrees down. I have often hurled stones at them; it was delightful to\nbreak the branches. Tell me, now, is it so very nice to be there?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe made Abbe Mouret stop in the middle of the road, and glared at him\nwith a terrible expression of jealousy. The thought of the priest\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nlife in the Paradou tortured him. But the Abbe kept perfect silence, so\nArchangias set off again, jeering as he went. Then, in a louder voice,\nhe said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You see, when a priest behaves as you have done, he scandalises every\nother priest. I myself felt sullied by your conduct. However, you\nare now behaving more sensibly. There is no need for you to make any\nconfession. I know what has happened well enough. Heaven has broken your\nback for you, as it has done for so many others. So much the better! So\nmuch the better!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe clapped his hands triumphantly. But Abbe Mouret, immersed in deep\nreverie, with a smile spreading over his whole face, did not even hear\nhim. When the Brother quitted him at the parsonage door, he went round\nand entered the church. It was grey and gloomy, as on that terrible\nrainy evening when temptation had racked him so violently. And it still\nremained poverty-stricken and meditative, bare of all that gleaming\ngold and sighing passion that had seemed to him to sweep in from the\ncountryside. It preserved solemn silence. But a breath of mercy seemed\nto fill it.\n\nKneeling before the great Christ and bursting into tears, which he let\nflow down his cheeks as though they were so many blessings, the priest\nmurmured:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098O God, it is not true that Thou art pitiless. I know it, I feel it:\nThou hast already pardoned me. I feel it in the outpouring of Thy grace,\nwhich, for hours now, has been flowing through me in a sweet stream,\nbringing me back, slowly but surely, perfect peace and spiritual health.\nO God, it was at the very moment when I was about to forsake Thee that\nThou didst protect me most effectually. Thou didst hide Thyself from me,\nthe better to rescue me from evil. Thou didst allow my flesh to run its\ncourse, that I might be convinced of its nothingness. And now, O God,\nI see that Thou hast for ever marked me with Thy seal, that awful seal,\npregnant with blessings, which sets a man apart from other men, and\nwhose mark is so ineffaceable that, sooner or later, it makes itself\nmanifest even upon those who sin. Thou hast broken me with sin and\ntemptation. Thou hast ravaged me with Thy flames. Thou hast willed\nthat there should be nought left of me save ruins wherein Thou mightest\nsafely descend. I am an empty tabernacle wherein Thou may\u00e2\u0080\u0099st dwell.\nBlessed art Thou, O God!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe prostrated himself and continued stammering in the dust. The church\ntriumphed. It remained firm and unshaken over the priest\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head, with\nits altars and its confessional, its pulpit, its crosses, and its holy\nimages. The world had ceased to exist. Temptation was extinguished like\na fire that was henceforth unnecessary for the Abbe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s purification. He\nwas entering into supernatural peace. And he raised this supreme cry:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098To the exclusion of life and its creatures and of everything that be in\nit, I belong to Thee, O God; to Thee, Thee alone, through all eternity!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\n\n\nXIV\n\nAt that moment Albine was still wandering about the Paradou with all\nthe mute agony of a wounded animal. She had ceased to weep. Her face was\nvery white and a deep crease showed upon her brow. Why did she have to\nsuffer that deathlike agony? Of what fault had she been guilty, that\nthe garden no longer kept the promises it had held out to her since\nher childhood\u00e2\u0080\u0099s days? She questioned herself as she walked along, never\nheeding the avenues through which the gloom was slowly stealing. She\nhad always obeyed the voices of the trees. She could not remember having\ninjured a single flower. She had ever been the beloved daughter of the\ngreenery, hearkening to it submissively, yielding to it with full belief\nin the happiness which it promised to her. And when, on that supreme\nday, the Paradou had cried to her to cast herself beneath the\ngiant-tree, she had done so in compliance with its voice. If she then\nhad nothing to reproach herself with, it must be the garden which had\nbetrayed her; the garden which was torturing her for the mere sake of\nseeing her suffer.\n\nShe halted and looked around her. The great gloomy masses of foliage\npreserved deep silence. The paths were blocked with black walls of\ndarkness. The distant lawns were lulling to sleep the breezes that\nkissed them. And she thrust out her hands with a gesture of hopelessness\nand raised a cry of protest. It could not all end thus. But her voice\nchoked beneath the silent trees. Thrice did she implore the Paradou to\nanswer her, but never an explanation fell from its lofty branches, not\na leaf seemed to be moved with pity for her. Then she resumed her weary\nwandering, and felt that she was entering into the fatal sternness of\nwinter. Now that she had ceased to rebelliously question the earth, she\ncaught sound of a gentle murmur speeding along the ground. It was the\nfarewell of the plants, wishing one another a happy death. To have drunk\nin the sunshine for a whole season, to have lived ever blossoming,\nto have breathed continual perfume, and then, at the first blast, to\ndepart, with the hope of springing up again elsewhere, was not that\nsufficiently long and full a life which obstinate craving for further\nexistence would mar? Ah! how sweet death must be; how sweet to have an\nendless night before one, wherein to dream of the short days of life and\nto recall eternally its fugitive joys!\n\nShe stayed her steps once more; but she no longer protested as she stood\nthere amidst the deep stillness of the Paradou. She now believed that\nshe understood everything. The garden doubtless had death in store for\nher as a supreme culminating happiness. It was to death that it had all\nalong been leading her in its tender fashion. After love, there could be\nnought but death. And never had the garden loved her so much as it did\nnow; she had shown herself ungrateful in accusing it, for all the time\nshe had remained its best beloved child. The motionless boughs, the\npaths blocked up with darkness, the lawns where the breezes fell asleep,\nhad only become mute in order that they might lure her on to taste the\njoys of long silence. They wished her to be with them in their winter\nrest, they dreamt of carrying her off, swathed in their dry leaves with\nher eyes frozen like the waters of the springs, her limbs stiffened like\nthe bare branches, and her blood sleeping the sleep of the sap. And,\nyes, she would live their life to the very end, and die their death.\nPerhaps they had already willed that she should spring up next summer as\na rose in the flower-garden, or a pale willow in the meadow-lands, or a\ntender birch in the forest. Yes, it was the great law of life; she was\nabout to die.\n\nThen, for the last time, she resumed her walk through the Paradou in\nquest of death. What fragrant plant might need her sweet-scented tresses\nto increase the perfume of its leaves? What flower might wish the gift\nof her satinlike skin, the snowy whiteness of her arms, the tender pink\nof her bosom? To what weakly tree should she offer her young blood? She\nwould have liked to be of service to the weeds vegetating beside the\npaths, to slay herself there so that from her flesh some huge greenery\nmight spring, lofty and sapful, laden with birds at May-time, and\npassionately caressed by the sun. But for a long while the Paradou still\nmaintained silence as if it had not yet made up its mind to confide to\nher in what last kiss it would spirit away her life. She had to wander\nall over it again, seeking, pilgrim-like, for her favourite spots. Night\nwas now more swiftly approaching, and it seemed to her as if she were\nbeing gradually sucked into the earth. She climbed to the great rocks\nand questioned them, asking whether it was upon their stony beds that\nshe must breathe her last breath. She crossed the forest with lingering\nsteps, hoping that some oak would topple down and bury her beneath the\nmajesty of its fall. She skirted the streams that flowed through the\nmeadows, bending down at almost every step she took so as to peep into\nthe depths and see whether a couch had not been prepared for her amongst\nthe water lilies. But nowhere did Death call her; nowhere did he offer\nher his cold hands. Yet, she was not mistaken. It was, indeed, the\nParadou that was about to teach her to die, as, indeed, it had taught\nher to love. She again began to scour the bushes, more eagerly even than\non those warm mornings of the past when she had gone searching for love.\nAnd, suddenly, just as she was reaching the parterre, she came upon\ndeath, amidst all the evening fragrance. She ran forward, breaking out\ninto a rapturous laugh. She was to die amongst the flowers.\n\nFirst she hastened to the thicket-like rosary. There, in the last\nflickering of the gloaming, she searched the beds and gathered all the\nroses that hung languishing at the approach of winter. She plucked them\nfrom down below, quite heedless of their thorns; she plucked them in\nfront of her, with both hands; she plucked them from above, rising upon\ntip-toes and pulling down the boughs. So eager was she, so desperate\nwas her haste, that she even broke the branches, she, who had ever shown\nherself tender to the tiniest blades of grass. Soon her arms were full\nof roses, she tottered beneath her burden of flowers. And having quite\nstripped the rose trees, carrying away even the fallen petals, she\nturned her steps to the pavilion; and when she had let her load of\nblossoms slip upon the floor of the room with the blue ceiling, she\nagain went down to the garden.\n\nThis time she sought the violets. She made huge bunches of them,\nwhich she pressed one by one against her breast. Then she sought the\ncarnations, plucking them all, even to the buds; massing them together\nin big sheaves of white blossoms that suggested bowls of milk, and big\nsheaves of the red ones, that seemed like bowls of blood. Then, too,\nshe sought the stocks, the patches of mirabilis, the heliotropes and\nthe lilies. She tore the last blossoming stocks off by the handful,\npitilessly crumpling their satin ruches; she devastated the beds of\nmirabilis, whose flowers were scarcely opening to the evening air; she\nmowed down the field of heliotropes, piling her harvest of blooms into\na heap; and she thrust bundles of lilies under her arms like handles\nof reeds. When she was again laden with as much as she could carry,\nshe returned to the pavilion to cast the violets, the carnations, the\nlilies, the stocks, the heliotrope, and the mirabilis by the side of\nthe roses. And then, without stopping to draw breath, she went down yet\nagain.\n\nThis time she repaired to that gloomy corner which seemed like the\ngraveyard of the flower-garden. A warm autumn had there brought on a\nsecond crop of spring flowers. She raided the borders of tuberoses and\nhyacinths; going down upon her knees, and gathering her harvest with\nall a miser\u00e2\u0080\u0099s care, lest she should miss a single blossom. The tuberoses\nseemed to her to be extremely precious flowers, which would distil drops\nof gold and wealth and wondrous sweetness. The hyacinths, beaded with\npearly blooms, were like necklets, whose every pearl would pour forth\njoys unknown to man. And although she almost buried herself beneath the\nmass of tuberoses and hyacinths which she plucked, she next stripped a\nfield of poppies, and even found means to crop an expanse of marigolds\nfarther on. All these she heaped over the tuberoses and hyacinths, and\nthen ran back to the room with the blue ceiling, taking the greatest\ncare as she went that the breeze should not rob her of a single pistil.\nAnd once more did she come downstairs.\n\nBut what was she to gather now? She had stripped the parterre bare. As\nshe rose upon the tips of her shoes in the dim gloom, she could only see\nthe garden lying there naked and dead, deprived of the tender eyes of\nits roses, the crimson smile of its carnations, and the perfumed locks\nof its heliotropes. Nevertheless, she could not return with empty arms.\nSo she laid hands upon the herbs and leafy plants. She crawled over the\nground, as though she would have carried off the very soil itself in\na clutch of supreme passion. She filled her skirt with a harvest of\naromatic plants, southernwood, mint, verbenas. She came across a border\nof balm, and left not a leaf of it unplucked. She even broke off two big\nfennels which she threw over her shoulders like a couple of trees. Had\nshe been able, she would have carried all the greenery of the garden\naway with her between her teeth. When she reached the threshold of the\npavilion, she turned round and gave a last look at the Paradou. It was\nquite dark now. The night had fully come and cast a black veil over\neverything. Then for the last time she went up the stairs, never more to\nstep down them.\n\nThe spacious room was quickly decked. She had placed a lighted lamp upon\nthe table. She sorted out the flowers heaped upon the floor and arranged\nthem in big bunches, which she distributed about the room. First she\nplaced some lilies behind the lamp on the table, forming with them a\nlofty lacelike screen which softened the light with its snowy purity.\nThen she threw handfuls of carnations and stocks over the old sofa,\nwhich was already strewn with red bouquets that had faded a century\nago, till all these were hidden, and the sofa looked like a huge bed of\nstocks bristling with carnations. Next she placed the four armchairs in\nfront of the alcove. On the first one she piled marigolds, on the second\npoppies, on the third mirabilis, and on the fourth heliotrope. The\nchairs were completely buried in bloom, with nothing but the tips of\ntheir arms visible. At last she thought of the bed. She pushed a little\ntable near the head of it, and reared thereon a huge pile of violets.\nThen she covered the whole bed with the hyacinths and tuberoses she\nhad plucked. They were so abundant that they formed a thick couch\noverflowing all around, so that the bed now looked like one colossal\nbloom.\n\nThe roses still remained. And these she scattered chancewise all over\nthe room, without even looking to see where they fell. Some of them\ndropped upon the table, the sofa, and the chairs; and a corner of the\nbed was inundated with them. For some minutes there was a rain of roses,\na real downpour of heavy blossoms, which settled in flowery pools in the\nhollows of the floor. But as the heap seemed scarcely diminished, she\nfinished by weaving garlands of roses which she hung upon the walls.\nShe twined wreaths around the necks and arms and waists of the plaster\ncupids that sported over the alcove. The blue ceiling, the oval panels,\nedged with flesh-coloured ribbon, the voluptuous paintings, preyed upon\nby time, were all hung with a mantle, a drapery of roses. The big room\nwas fully decked at last. Now she could die there.\n\nFor a moment she remained standing, glancing around her. She was looking\nto see if death was there. And she gathered up the aromatic greenery,\nthe southernwood, the mint, the verbenas, the balm, and the fennel. She\nbroke them and twisted them and made wedges of them with which to stop\nup every little chink and cranny about the windows and the door. Then\nshe drew the white coarsely sewn calico curtains and, without even a\nsigh, laid herself upon the bed, on all the florescence of hyacinths and\ntuberoses.\n\nAnd then a final rapture was granted her. With her eyes wide open she\nsmiled at the room. Ah! how she had loved there! And how happily she was\nthere going to die! At that supreme moment the plaster cupids suggested\nnothing impure to her; the amorous paintings disturbed her no more. She\nwas conscious of nothing beneath that blue ceiling save the intoxicating\nperfume of the flowers. And it seemed to her as if this perfume was none\nother than the old love-fragrance which had always warmed the room, now\nincreased a hundredfold, till it had become so strong and penetrating\nthat it would surely suffocate her. Perchance it was the breath of the\nlady who had died there a century ago. In perfect stillness, with her\nhands clasped over her heart, she continued smiling, while she listened\nto the whispers of the perfumes in her buzzing head. They were singing\nto her a soft strange melody of fragrance, which slowly and very gently\nlulled her to sleep.\n\nAt first there was a prelude, bright and childlike; her hands, that had\njust now twisted and twined the aromatic greenery, exhaled the pungency\nof crushed herbage, and recalled her old girlish ramblings through the\nwildness of the Paradou. Then there came a flutelike song, a song of\nshort musky notes, rising from the violets that lay upon the table near\nthe head of the bed; and this flutelike strain, trilling melodiously to\nthe soft accompaniment of the lilies on the other table, sang to her of\nthe first joys of love, its first confession, and first kiss beneath the\ntrees of the forest. But she began to stifle as passion drew nigh with\nthe clove-like breath of the carnations, which burst upon her in brazen\nnotes that seemed to drown all others. She thought that death was nigh\nwhen the poppies and the marigolds broke into a wailing strain, which\nrecalled the torment of desire. But suddenly all grew quieter; she felt\nthat she could breathe more freely; she glided into greater serenity,\nlulled by a descending scale that came from the throats of the stocks,\nand died away amidst a delightful hymn from the heliotropes, which, with\ntheir vanilla-like breath, proclaimed the approach of nuptial bliss.\nHere and there the mirabilis gently trilled. Then came a hush. And\nafterwards the roses languidly made their entry. Their voices streamed\nfrom the ceiling, like the strains of a distant choir. It was a chorus\nof great breadth, to which she at first listened with a slight quiver.\nThen the volume of the strain increased, and soon her whole frame\nvibrated with the mighty sounds that burst in waves around her. The\nnuptials were at hand, the trumpet blasts of the roses announced\nthem. She pressed her hands more closely to her heart as she lay there\npanting, gasping, dying. When she opened her lips for the kiss which was\nto stifle her, the hyacinths and tuberoses shot out their perfume and\nenveloped her with so deep, so great a sigh that the chorus of the roses\ncould be heard no more.\n\nAnd then, amidst the final gasp of the flowers, Albine died.\n\n\n\n\nXV\n\nAbout three o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock the next afternoon, La Teuse and Brother Archangias,\nwho were chatting on the parsonage-steps, saw Doctor Pascal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gig\ncome at full gallop through the village. The whip was being vigorously\nbrandished from beneath the lowered hood.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Where can he be off to at that rate?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 murmured the old servant. \u00e2\u0080\u0098He\nwill break his neck.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe gig had just reached the rising ground on which the church was\nbuilt. Suddenly, the horse reared and stopped, and the doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head,\nwith its long white hair all dishevelled appeared from under the hood.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Is Serge there?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he cried, in a voice full of indignant excitement.\n\nLa Teuse had stepped to the edge of the hill. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Monsieur le Cure is in\nhis room,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said. \u00e2\u0080\u0098He must be reading his breviary. Do you want to\nspeak to him? Shall I call him?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nUncle Pascal, who seemed almost distracted, made an angry gesture with\nhis whip hand. Bending still further forward, at the risk of falling\nout, he replied:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reading his breviary, is he? No! no! don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t call him. I should\nstrangle him, and that would do no good. I wanted to tell him that\nAlbine was dead. Dead! do you hear me? Tell him, from me, that she is\ndead!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAnd he drove off, lashing his horse so fiercely that it almost bolted.\nBut, twenty paces away, he pulled up again, and once more stretching out\nhis head, cried loudly:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Tell him, too, from me, that she was _enceinte_! It will please him to\nknow that.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen the gig rolled on wildly again, jolting dangerously as it ascended\nthe stony hill that led to the Paradou. La Teuse was quite dumbfounded.\nBut Brother Archangias sniggered and looked at her with savage delight\nglittering in his eyes. She noticed this at last, and thrust him away\nfrom her, almost making him fall down the steps.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Be off with you!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she stammered, full of anger, seeking to relieve her\nfeelings by abusing him. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I shall grow to hate you. Is it possible to\nrejoice at any one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death? I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fond of the girl, myself; but it is\nvery sad to die at her age. Be off with you, and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go on sniggering\nlike that, or I will throw my scissors in your face!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nIt was only about one o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock that a peasant, who had gone to Plassans\nto sell vegetables, had told Doctor Pascal of Albine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death, and had\nadded that Jeanbernat wished to see him. The doctor now was feeling a\nlittle relieved by what he had just shouted as he passed the parsonage.\nHe had gone out of his way expressly to give himself that satisfaction.\nHe reproached himself for the death of the girl as for a crime in which\nhe had participated. All along the road he had never ceased overwhelming\nhimself with insults, and though he wiped the tears from his eyes that\nhe might see where to guide his horse, he ever angrily drove his gig\nover heaps of stones, as if hoping that he would overturn himself and\nbreak one of his limbs. However, when he reached the long lane that\nskirted the endless wall of the park, a glimmer of hope broke upon him.\nPerhaps Albine was only in a dead faint. The peasant had told him that\nshe had suffocated herself with flowers. Ah! if he could only get there\nin time, if he could only save her! And he lashed his horse ferociously\nas though he were lashing himself.\n\nIt was a lovely day. The pavilion was all bathed in sunlight, just as\nit had been in the fair spring-time. But the leaves of the ivy which\nmounted to the roof were spotted and patched with rust, and bees\nno longer buzzed round the tall gilliflowers. Doctor Pascal hastily\ntethered his horse and pushed open the gate of the little garden. All\naround still prevailed that perfect silence amidst which Jeanbernat\nhad been wont to smoke his pipe; but, to-day, the old man was no longer\nseated on his bench watching his lettuces.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Jeanbernat!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 called the doctor.\n\nNo one answered. Then, on entering the vestibule, he saw something that\nhe had never seen before. At the end of the passage, below the dark\nstaircase, was a door opening into the Paradou, and he could see the\nvast garden spreading there beneath the pale sunlight, with all its\nautumn melancholy, its sere and yellow foliage. The doctor hurried\nthrough the doorway and took a few steps over the damp grass.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! it is you, doctor!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Jeanbernat in a calm voice.\n\nThe old man was digging a hole at the foot of a mulberry-tree. He had\nstraightened his tall figure on hearing the approach of footsteps.\nBut he promptly betook himself to his task again, throwing out at each\neffort a huge mass of rich soil.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What are you doing there?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 asked Doctor Pascal.\n\nJeanbernat straightened himself again and wiped the sweat off his\nface with the sleeve of his jacket. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I am digging a hole,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he answered\nsimply. \u00e2\u0080\u0098She always loved the garden, and it will please her to sleep\nhere.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe doctor nearly choked with emotion. For a moment he stood by the\nedge of the grave, incapable of speaking, but watching Jeanbernat as the\nother sturdily dug on.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Where is she?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he asked at last.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Up there, in her room. I left her on the bed. I should like you to\ngo and listen to her heart before she is put away in here. I listened\nmyself, but I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hear anything at all.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe doctor went upstairs. The room had not been disturbed. Only a\nwindow had been opened. There the withered flowers, stifled by their own\nperfumes, exhaled but the faint odour of dead beauty. Within the alcove,\nhowever, there still hung an asphyxiating warmth, which seemed to\ntrickle into the room and gradually disperse in tiny puffs. Albine,\nsnowy-pale, with her hands upon her heart and a smile playing over her\nface, lay sleeping on her couch of hyacinths and tuberoses. And she\nwas quite happy, since she was quite dead. Standing by the bedside,\nthe doctor gazed at her for a long time, with a keen expression such as\ncomes into the eyes of scientists who attempt to work resurrections. But\nhe did not even disturb her clasped hands. He kissed her brow, on the\nspot where her latent maternity had already set a slight shadow. Below,\nin the garden, Jeanbernat was still driving his spade into the ground in\nheavy, regular fashion.\n\nA quarter of an hour later, however, the old man came upstairs. He had\ncompleted his work. He found the doctor seated by the bedside, buried\nin such a deep reverie that he did not seem conscious of the heavy tears\nthat were trickling down his cheeks.\n\nThe two men only glanced at each other. Then, after an interval of\nsilence, Jeanbernat slowly said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, was I not right? There is nothing, nothing, nothing. It is all\nmere nonsense.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe remained standing and began to pick up the roses that had fallen from\nthe bed, throwing them, one by one, upon Albine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s skirts.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The flowers,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098live only for a day, while the rough nettles,\nlike me, wear out the very stones amidst which they spring.... Now it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nall over; I can kick the bucket; I am nearly distracted. My last ray of\nsunlight has been snuffed out. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all nonsense, as I said before.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe threw himself upon one of the chairs in his turn. He did not shed\na tear; he bore himself with rigid despair, like some automaton whose\nmechanism is broken. Mechanically he reached out his hand and took a\nbook that lay on the little table strewn with violets. It was one of the\nbooks stored away in the loft, an odd volume of Holbach,* which he had\nbeen reading since the morning, while watching by Albine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body. As the\ndoctor still remained silent, buried in distressful thought, he began to\nturn its pages over. But a sadden idea occurred to him.\n\n  * Doubtless Holbach\u00e2\u0080\u0099s now forgotten _Catechism of Nature_, into\n    which M. Zola himself may well have peeped whilst writing this\n    story.--ED.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098If you will help me,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said to the doctor, \u00e2\u0080\u0098we will carry her\ndownstairs, and bury her with all her flowers.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nUncle Pascal shuddered. Then he explained to the old man that it was not\nallowed for one to keep the dead in that fashion.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What! it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t allowed!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cried Jeanbernat. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, then, I will allow\nit myself! Doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t she belong to me? Isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t she mine? Do you think I am\ngoing to let the priests walk off with her? Let them try, if they want\nto get a shot from my gun!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe sprang to his feet and waved his book about with a terrible gesture.\nBut the doctor caught hold of his hands and clasped them within his own,\nbeseeching him to be calm. And for a long time he talked to him, saying\nall that he had upon his mind. He blamed himself, made fragmentary\nconfessions of his fault, and vaguely hinted at those who had killed\nAlbine.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Listen,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said in conclusion, \u00e2\u0080\u0098she is yours no longer; you must give\nher up.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut Jeanbernat shook his head, and again waved his hand in token of\nrefusal. However, his obstinate resolution was shaken; and at last he\nsaid:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, well, let them take her, and may she break their arms for them!\nI only wish that she could rise up out of the ground and kill them all\nwith fright.... By the way. I have a little business to settle over\nthere. I will go to-morrow.... Good-bye, then, doctor. The hole will do\nfor me.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAnd, when the doctor had left, he again sat down by the dead girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nside, and gravely resumed the perusal of his book.\n\n\n\n\nXVI\n\nThat morning there was great commotion in the yard at the parsonage.\nThe Artaud butcher had just slaughtered Matthew, the pig, in the shed.\nDesiree, quite enthusiastic about it all, had held Matthew\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feet, while\nhe was being bled, kissing him on the back that he might feel the pain\nof the knife less, and telling him that it was absolutely necessary that\nhe should be killed, now that he had got so fat. No one could cut off a\ngoose\u00e2\u0080\u0099s neck with a single stroke of the hatchet more unconcernedly than\nshe could, or gash open a fowl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s throat with a pair of scissors. However\nmuch she loved her charges, she looked upon their slaughter with great\nequanimity. It was quite necessary, she would say. It made room for the\nyoung ones who were growing up. And that morning she was very gay.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Mademoiselle,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 grumbled La Teuse every minute, \u00e2\u0080\u0098you will end by making\nyourself ill. There is no sense in working yourself up into such a\nstate, just because a pig has been slaughtered. You are as red as if you\nhad been dancing a whole night.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut Desiree only clapped her hands and turned away and bustled about\nagain. La Teuse, for her part, complained that her legs were sinking\nunder her. Since six o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock in the morning her big carcass had been\nperpetually rolling between the kitchen and the yard, for she had black\npuddings to make. It was she who had whisked the blood in two large\nearthenware pans, and she had thought that she would never get finished,\nsince mademoiselle was for ever calling her away for mere nothings.\n\nIt must be admitted that, at the very moment when the butcher was\nbleeding Matthew, Desiree had been thrilled with wild excitement, for\nLisa, the cow, was about to calve. And the girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s delight at this had\nquite turned her head.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098One goes and another comes!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she cried, skipping and twirling round.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Come here, La Teuse! come here!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nIt was eleven o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock. Every now and then the sound of chanting was\nwafted from the church. A confused murmur of doleful voices, a muttering\nof prayers could be heard amidst scraps of Latin pronounced in louder\nand clearer tones.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Come! oh, do come!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 repeated Desiree for the twentieth time.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I must go and toll the bell, now,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 muttered the old servant. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I shall\nnever get finished really. What is it that you want now, mademoiselle?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut she did not wait for an answer. She threw herself upon a swarm of\nfowls, who were greedily drinking the blood from the pans. And having\nangrily kicked them away, and then covered up the pans, she called to\nDesiree:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It would be a great deal better if, instead of tormenting me, you only\ncame to look after these wretched birds. If you let them do as they like\nthere will be no black-pudding for you. Do you hear?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nDesiree only laughed. What of it, if the fowls did drink a few drops of\nthe blood? It would fatten them. Then she again tried to drag La Teuse\noff to the cow, but the old servant refused to go.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I must go and toll the bell. The procession will be coming out of\nchurch directly. You know that quite well.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAt this moment the voices in the church rose yet more loudly, and a\nsound of steps could be distinctly heard.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No! no!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 insisted Desiree, dragging La Teuse towards the stable. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Just\ncome and look at her, and tell me what ought to be done.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nLa Teuse shrugged her shoulders. All that the cow wanted was to be left\nalone and not bothered. Then she set off towards the vestry, but, as she\npassed the shed, she raised a fresh cry:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There! there!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she shrieked, shaking her fist. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! the little wretch!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nMatthew was lying at full length on his back, with his feet in the air,\nunder the shed, waiting to be singed.* The gash which the knife had made\nin his neck was still quite fresh, and was beaded with drops of blood.\nAnd a little white hen was very delicately picking off these drops of\nblood one by one.\n\n  * In some parts of France pigs, when killed, are singed, not scalded,\n    as is, I think, the usual practice in England.--ED.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Why, of course,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 quietly remarked Desiree, \u00e2\u0080\u0098she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s regaling herself.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nAnd the girl stooped and patted the pig\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plump belly, saying: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Eh! my\nfat fellow, you have stolen their food too often to grudge them a wee\nbit of your neck now!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nLa Teuse hastily doffed her apron and threw it round Matthew\u00e2\u0080\u0099s neck.\nThen she hurried away and disappeared within the church. The great door\nhad just creaked on its rusty hinges, and a burst of chanting rose in\nthe open air amidst the quiet sunshine. Suddenly the bell began to toll\nwith slow and regular strokes. Desiree, who had remained kneeling\nbeside the pig patting his belly, raised her head to listen, while still\ncontinuing to smile. When she saw that she was alone, having glanced\ncautiously around, she glided away into the cow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stable and closed the\ndoor behind her.\n\nThe little iron gate of the graveyard, which had been opened quite wide\nto let the body pass, hung against the wall, half torn from its hinges.\nThe sunshine slept upon the herbage of the empty expanse, into which the\nfuneral procession passed, chanting the last verse of the _Miserere_.\nThen silence fell.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098_Requiem \u00c3\u00a6ternam dona ei, Domine_,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 resumed Abbe Mouret, in solemn\ntones.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098_Et lux perpetua luceat ei_,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Brother Archangias bellowed.\n\nAt the head walked Vincent, wearing a surplice and bearing the cross,\na large copper cross, half the silver plating of which had come off. He\nlifted it aloft with both his hands. Then followed Abbe Mouret, looking\nvery pale in his black chasuble, but with his head erect, and without\na quiver on his lips as he chanted the office, gazing into the distance\nwith fixed eyes. The flame of the lighted candle which he was carrying\nscarcely showed in the daylight. And behind him, almost touching him,\ncame Albine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coffin, borne by four peasants on a sort of litter,\npainted black. The coffin was clumsily covered with too short a pall,\nand at the lower end of it the fresh deal of which it was made could be\nseen, with the heads of the nails sparkling with a steely glitter. Upon\nthe pall lay flowers: handfuls of white roses, hyacinths, and tuberoses,\ntaken from the dead girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very bed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Just be careful!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cried Brother Archangias to the peasants, as they\nslightly tilted the litter in order to get it through the gateway. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You\nwill be upsetting everything on to the ground!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe kept the coffin in its place with one of his fat hands. With the\nother--as there was no second clerk--he was carrying the holy-water\nvessel, and he likewise represented the choirman, the rural guard, who\nhad been unable to come.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Come in, too, you others,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he exclaimed, turning round.\n\nThere was a second funeral, that of Rosalie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s baby, who had died the\nprevious day from an attack of convulsions. The mother, the father, old\nmother Brichet, Catherine, and two big girls, La Rousse and Lisa, were\nthere. The two last were carrying the baby\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coffin, one supporting each\nend.\n\nSuddenly all voices were hushed again, and there came another interval\nwhilst the bell continued tolling in slow and desolate accents. The\nfuneral procession crossed the entire burial-ground, going towards\nthe corner which was formed by the church and the wall of Desiree\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\npoultry-yard. Swarms of grasshoppers leaped away at the approaching\nfootsteps, and lizards hurried into their holes. A heavy warmth hung\nover this corner of the loamy cemetery. The crackling of the dry grass\nbeneath the tramp of the mourners sounded like choking sobs.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There! stop where you are!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cried the Brother, barring the way before\nthe two big girls who were carrying the baby\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coffin. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Wait for your\nturn. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be getting in our legs here.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe two girls laid the baby on the ground. Rosalie, Fortune, and old\nmother Brichet were lingering in the middle of the graveyard, while\nCatherine slyly followed Brother Archangias. Albine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grave was on\nthe left hand of Abbe Caffin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tomb, whose white stone seemed in the\nsunshine to be flecked with silvery spangles. The deep cavity, freshly\ndug that morning, yawned amidst thick tufts of grass. Big weeds, almost\nuprooted, drooped over the edges, and a fallen flower lay at the bottom,\nstaining the dark soil with its crimson petals. When Abbe Mouret came\nforward, the soft earth crumbled and gave way beneath his feet; he was\nobliged to step back to keep himself from slipping into the grave.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098_Ego sum_--\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he began in a full voice, which rose above the mournful\ntolling of the bell.\n\nDuring the anthem, those who were present instinctively cast furtive\nglances towards the bottom of the empty grave. Vincent, who had planted\nthe cross at the foot of the cavity opposite the priest, pushed the\nloose earth with his foot, and amused himself by watching it fall. This\ndrew a laugh from Catherine, who was leaning forward from behind him to\nget a better view. The peasants had set the litter on the grass and were\nstretching their arms, while Brother Archangias prepared the sprinkler.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Come here, Voriau!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 called Fortune.\n\nThe big black dog, who had gone to sniff at the coffin, came back\nsulkily.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Why has the dog been brought?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed Rosalie.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh! he followed us,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lisa, smiling quietly.\n\nThey were all chatting together in subdued tones round the baby\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ncoffin. The father and mother occasionally forgot all about it, but\non catching sight of it again, lying between them at their feet, they\nrelapsed into silence.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And so old Bambousse wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said La Rousse. Mother Brichet\nraised her eyes to heaven.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He threatened to break everything to pieces yesterday when the little\none died,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said she. \u00e2\u0080\u0098No, no, I must say that he is not a good man.\nDidn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t he nearly strangle me, crying out that he had been robbed, and\nthat he would have given one of his cornfields for the little one to\nhave died three days before the wedding?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098One can never tell what will happen,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 remarked Fortune with a knowing\nlook.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the good of the old man putting himself out about it? We are\nmarried, all the same, now,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 added Rosalie.\n\nThen they exchanged a smile across the little coffin while Lisa and\nLa Rousse nudged each other with their elbows. But afterwards they all\nbecame very serious again. Fortune picked up a clod of earth to throw at\nVoriau, who was now prowling about amongst the old tombstones.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve nearly finished over there, now!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 La Rousse whispered very\nsoftly.\n\nAbbe Mouret was just concluding the _De profundis_ in front of Albine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ngrave. Then, with slow steps, he approached the coffin, drew himself up\nerect, and gazed at it for a moment without a quiver in his glance. He\nlooked taller, his face shone with a serenity that seemed to transfigure\nhim. He stooped and picked up a handful of earth, and scattered it over\nthe coffin crosswise. Then, in a voice so steady and clear that not a\nsyllable was lost, he said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098_Revertitur in terrain suam unde erat, et spiritus redit ad Deum qui\ndedit illum_.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nA shudder ran through those who were present. Lisa seemed to reflect for\na moment, and then remarked with an expression of worry: \u00e2\u0080\u0098It is not very\ncheerful, eh, when one thinks that one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own turn will come some day or\nother.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut Brother Archangias had now handed the sprinkler to the priest, who\ntook it and shook it several times over the corpse.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098_Requiescat in pace_,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he murmured.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098_Amen_,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 responded Vincent and the Brother together, in tones so\nrespectively shrill and deep that Catherine had to cram her fist into\nher mouth to keep from laughing.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No, indeed, it is certainly not cheerful,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 continued Lisa. \u00e2\u0080\u0098There\nreally was nobody at all at that funeral. The graveyard would be quite\nempty without us.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard say that she killed herself,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said old mother Brichet.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes, I know,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 interrupted La Rousse. \u00e2\u0080\u0098The Brother didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to\nlet her be buried amongst Christians, but Monsieur le Cure said\nthat eternity was for everybody. I was there. But all the same the\nPhilosopher might have come.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAt that very moment Rosalie reduced them all to silence by murmuring:\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098See! there he is, the Philosopher.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nJeanbernat was, indeed, just entering the graveyard. He walked straight\nto the group that stood around Albine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grave; and he stepped along with\nso lithe, so springy a gait, that none of them heard him coming. When\nhe was close to them, he remained for a moment behind Brother Archangias\nand seemed to fix his eyes, for an instant, on the nape of the Brother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nneck. Then, just as the Abbe Mouret was finishing the office, he calmly\ndrew a knife from his pocket, opened it, and with a single cut sliced\noff the Brother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right ear.\n\nThere had been no time for any one to interfere. The Brother gave a\nterrible yell.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The left one will be for another occasion,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Jeanbernat quietly, as\nhe threw the ear upon the ground. Then he went off.\n\nSo great and so general was the stupefaction that nobody followed him.\nBrother Archangias had dropped upon the heap of fresh soil which had\nbeen thrown out of the grave. He was staunching his bleeding wound with\nhis handkerchief. One of the four peasants who had carried the coffin,\nwanted to lead him away, conduct him home; but he refused with a gesture\nand remained where he was, fierce and sullen, wishing to see Albine\nlowered into the pit.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There! it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s our turn at last!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Rosalie with a little sigh.\n\nBut Abbe Mouret still lingered by the grave, watching the bearers who\nwere slipping cords under Albine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coffin in order that they might let\nit down gently. The bell was still tolling; but La Teuse must have been\ngetting tired, for it tolled irregularly, as though it were becoming a\nlittle irritated at the length of the ceremony.\n\nThe sun was growing hotter and the Solitaire\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shadow crept slowly over\nthe grass and the grave mounds. When Abbe Mouret was obliged to step\nback in order to give the bearers room, his eyes lighted upon the marble\ntombstone of Abbe Caffin, that priest who also had loved, and who was\nnow sleeping there so peacefully beneath the wild-flowers.\n\nThen, all at once, even as the coffin descended, supported by the cords,\nwhose knots made it strain and creak, a tremendous uproar arose in the\npoultry-yard on the other side of the wall. The goat began to bleat. The\nducks, the geese, and the turkeys raised their loudest calls and flapped\ntheir wings. The fowls all cackled at once. The yellow cock, Alexander,\ncrowed forth his trumpet notes. The rabbits could even be heard leaping\nin their hutches and shaking their wooden floors. And, above all this\nlifeful uproar of the animal creation, a loud laugh rang out. There was\na rustling of skirts. Desiree, with her hair streaming, her arms bare\nto the elbows, and her face crimson with triumph, burst into sight, her\nhands resting upon the coping of the wall. She had doubtless climbed\nupon the manure-heap.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Serge! Serge!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she cried.\n\nAt that moment Albine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coffin had reached the bottom of the grave.\nThe cords had just been withdrawn. One of the peasants was throwing the\nfirst shovelful of earth into the cavity.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Serge! Serge!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Desiree cried, still more loudly, clapping her hands,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098the cow has got a calf!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\n\n                              THE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Abbe Mouret\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Transgression, by Emile Zola\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ABBE MOURET\u00e2\u0080\u0099S TRANSGRESSION ***\n\n***** This file should be named 14200-0.txt or 14200-0.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/1\/4\/2\/0\/14200\/\n\nProduced by Dagny; and David Widger\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s laws.\n\nThe Foundation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1201,"split":"test"}
