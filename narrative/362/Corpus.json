He has lived an extremely decadent life in Paris, which has left him disgusted with human society. Without telling anyone, he retreats to a house in the countryside.\nHe fills the house with his eclectic art collection (which notably consists of reprints of paintings of Gustave Moreau). Drawing from the theme of Gustave Flaubert's Bouvard et P\u00e9cuchet, Des Esseintes decides to spend the rest of his life in intellectual and aesthetic contemplation. Throughout his intellectual experiments, he recalls various debauched events and love affairs of his past in Paris.\nHe conducts a survey of French and Latin literature, rejecting the works approved by the mainstream critics of his day. Among French authors, he shows nothing but contempt for the Romantics but adores the poetry of Baudelaire and that of the nascent Symbolist movement of Paul Verlaine, Tristan Corbi\u00e8re and St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9, as well as the decadent fiction of the unorthodox Catholic writers Auguste Villiers de l'Isle-Adam and Barbey d'Aurevilly. He rejects the academically respectable Latin authors of the \"Golden Age\" such as Virgil and Cicero, preferring later \"Silver Age\" writers such as Petronius and Apuleius as well as works of early Christian literature, whose style was usually dismissed as the \"barbarous\" product of the Dark Ages. Schopenhauer, he exclaims, has seen the truth, and he clearly expressed it in his philosophy. He studies Moreau's paintings, he tries his hand at inventing perfumes, and he creates a garden of poisonous flowers. In one of the book's most surrealistic episodes, he has gemstones set in the shell of a tortoise. The extra weight on the creature's back causes its death. In another episode, he decides to visit London after reading the novels of Dickens. He dines at an English restaurant in Paris while waiting for his train and is delighted by the resemblance of the people to his notions derived from literature. He then cancels his trip and returns home, convinced that only disillusion would await him if he were to follow through with his plans.\nEventually, his late nights and idiosyncratic diet take their toll on his health, requiring him to return to Paris or to forfeit his life. In the last lines of the book, he compares his return to human society to that of a non-believer trying to embrace religion.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Against The Grain, by Joris-Karl Huysmans\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Closely arrayed, side by\nside, in the old frames which their broad shoulders filled, they\nstartled one with the fixed gaze of their eyes, their fierce\nmoustaches and the chests whose deep curves filled the enormous shells\nof their cuirasses.\n\nThese were the ancestors. There were no portraits of their descendants\nand a wide breach existed in the series of the faces of this race.\nOnly one painting served as a link to connect the past and present--a\ncrafty, mysterious head with haggard and gaunt features, cheekbones\npunctuated with a comma of paint, the hair overspread with pearls, a\npainted neck rising stiffly from the fluted ruff.\n\nIn this representation of one of the most intimate friends of the Duc\nd'Epernon and the Marquis d'O, the ravages of a sluggish and\nimpoverished constitution were already noticeable.\n\nIt was obvious that the decadence of this family had followed an\nunvarying course. The effemination of the males had continued with\nquickened tempo. As if to conclude the work of long years, the Des\nEsseintes had intermarried for two centuries, using up, in such\nconsanguineous unions, such strength as remained.\n\nThere was only one living scion of this family which had once been so\nnumerous that it had occupied all the territories of the Ile-de-France\nand La Brie. The Duc Jean was a slender, nervous young man of thirty,\nwith hollow cheeks, cold, steel-blue eyes, a straight, thin nose and\ndelicate hands.\n\nBy a singular, atavistic reversion, the last descendant resembled the\nold grandsire, from whom he had inherited the pointed, remarkably fair\nbeard and an ambiguous expression, at once weary and cunning.\n\nHis childhood had been an unhappy one. Menaced with scrofula and\nafflicted with relentless fevers, he yet succeeded in crossing the\nbreakers of adolescence, thanks to fresh air and careful attention. He\ngrew stronger, overcame the languors of chlorosis and reached his full\ndevelopment.\n\nHis mother, a tall, pale, taciturn woman, died of anaemia, and his\nfather of some uncertain malady. Des Esseintes was then seventeen\nyears of age.\n\nHe retained but a vague memory of his parents and felt neither\naffection nor gratitude for them. He hardly knew his father, who\nusually resided in Paris. He recalled his mother as she lay motionless\nin a dim room of the Chateau de Lourps. The husband and wife would\nmeet on rare occasions, and he remembered those lifeless interviews\nwhen his parents sat face to face in front of a round table faintly\nlit by a lamp with a wide, low-hanging shade, for the _duchesse_ could\nnot endure light or sound without being seized with a fit of\nnervousness. A few, halting words would be exchanged between them in\nthe gloom and then the indifferent _duc_ would depart to meet the\nfirst train back to Paris.\n\nJean's life at the Jesuit school, where he was sent to study, was more\npleasant. At first the Fathers pampered the lad whose intelligence\nastonished them. But despite their efforts, they could not induce him\nto concentrate on studies requiring discipline. He nibbled at various\nbooks and was precociously brilliant in Latin. On the contrary, he was\nabsolutely incapable of construing two Greek words, showed no aptitude\nfor living languages and promptly proved himself a dunce when obliged\nto master the elements of the sciences.\n\nHis family gave him little heed. Sometimes his father visited him at\nschool. \"How are you . . . be good . . . study hard . . . \"--and he\nwas gone. The lad passed the summer vacations at the Chateau de\nLourps, but his presence could not seduce his mother from her\nreveries. She scarcely noticed him; when she did, her gaze would rest\non him for a moment with a sad smile--and that was all. The moment\nafter she would again become absorbed in the artificial night with\nwhich the heavily curtained windows enshrouded the room.\n\nThe servants were old and dull. Left to himself, the boy delved into\nbooks on rainy days and roamed about the countryside on pleasant\nafternoons.\n\nIt was his supreme delight to wander down the little valley to\nJutigny, a village planted at the foot of the hills, a tiny heap of\ncottages capped with thatch strewn with tufts of sengreen and clumps\nof moss. In the open fields, under the shadow of high ricks, he would\nlie, listening to the hollow splashing of the mills and inhaling the\nfresh breeze from Voulzie. Sometimes he went as far as the peat-bogs,\nto the green and black hamlet of Longueville, or climbed wind-swept\nhillsides affording magnificent views. There, below to one side, as\nfar as the eye could reach, lay the Seine valley, blending in the\ndistance with the blue sky; high up, near the horizon, on the other\nside, rose the churches and tower of Provins which seemed to tremble\nin the golden dust of the air.\n\nImmersed in solitude, he would dream or read far into the night. By\nprotracted contemplation of the same thoughts, his mind grew sharp,\nhis vague, undeveloped ideas took on form. After each vacation, Jean\nreturned to his masters more reflective and headstrong. These changes\ndid not escape them. Subtle and observant, accustomed by their\nprofession to plumb souls to their depths, they were fully aware of\nhis unresponsiveness to their teachings. They knew that this student\nwould never contribute to the glory of their order, and as his family\nwas rich and apparently careless of his future, they soon renounced\nthe idea of having him take up any of the professions their school\noffered. Although he willingly discussed with them those theological\ndoctrines which intrigued his fancy by their subtleties and\nhair-splittings, they did not even think of training him for the\nreligious orders, since, in spite of their efforts, his faith remained\nlanguid. As a last resort, through prudence and fear of the harm he\nmight effect, they permitted him to pursue whatever studies pleased\nhim and to neglect the others, being loath to antagonize this bold and\nindependent spirit by the quibblings of the lay school assistants.\n\nThus he lived in perfect contentment, scarcely feeling the parental\nyoke of the priests. He continued his Latin and French studies when\nthe whim seized him and, although theology did not figure in his\nschedule, he finished his apprenticeship in this science, begun at the\nChateau de Lourps, in the library bequeathed by his grand-uncle, Dom\nProsper, the old prior of the regular canons of Saint-Ruf.\n\nBut soon the time came when he must quit the Jesuit institution. He\nattained his majority and became master of his fortune. The Comte de\nMontchevrel, his cousin and guardian, placed in his hands the title to\nhis wealth. There was no intimacy between them, for there was no\npossible point of contact between these two men, the one young, the\nother old. Impelled by curiosity, idleness or politeness, Des\nEsseintes sometimes visited the Montchevrel family and spent some dull\nevenings in their Rue de la Chaise mansion where the ladies, old as\nantiquity itself, would gossip of quarterings of the noble arms,\nheraldic moons and anachronistic ceremonies.\n\nThe men, gathered around whist tables, proved even more shallow and\ninsignificant than the dowagers; these descendants of ancient,\ncourageous knights, these last branches of feudal races, appeared to\nDes Esseintes as catarrhal, crazy, old men repeating inanities and\ntime-worn phrases. A _fleur de lis_ seemed the sole imprint on the\nsoft pap of their brains.\n\nThe youth felt an unutterable pity for these mummies buried in their\nelaborate hypogeums of wainscoting and grotto work, for these tedious\ntriflers whose eyes were forever turned towards a hazy Canaan, an\nimaginary Palestine.\n\nAfter a few visits with such relatives, he resolved never again to set\nfoot in their homes, regardless of invitations or reproaches.\n\nThen he began to seek out the young men of his own age and set.\n\nOne group, educated like himself in religious institutions, preserved\nthe special marks of this training. They attended religious services,\nreceived the sacrament on Easter, frequented the Catholic circles and\nconcealed as criminal their amorous escapades. For the most part, they\nwere unintelligent, acquiescent fops, stupid bores who had tried the\npatience of their professors. Yet these professors were pleased to\nhave bestowed such docile, pious creatures upon society.\n\nThe other group, educated in the state colleges or in the _lycees_,\nwere less hypocritical and much more courageous, but they were neither\nmore interesting nor less bigoted. Gay young men dazzled by operettas\nand races, they played lansquenet and baccarat, staked large fortunes\non horses and cards, and cultivated all the pleasures enchanting to\nbrainless fools. After a year's experience, Des Esseintes felt an\noverpowering weariness of this company whose debaucheries seemed to\nhim so unrefined, facile and indiscriminate without any ardent\nreactions or excitement of nerves and blood.\n\nHe gradually forsook them to make the acquaintance of literary men, in\nwhom he thought he might find more interest and feel more at ease.\nThis, too, proved disappointing; he was revolted by their rancorous\nand petty judgments, their conversation as obvious as a church door,\ntheir dreary discussions in which they judged the value of a book by\nthe number of editions it had passed and by the profits acquired. At\nthe same time, he noticed that the free thinkers, the doctrinaires of\nthe bourgeoisie, people who claimed every liberty that they might\nstifle the opinions of others, were greedy and shameless puritans\nwhom, in education, he esteemed inferior to the corner shoemaker.\n\nHis contempt for humanity deepened. He reached the conclusion that the\nworld, for the most part, was composed of scoundrels and imbeciles.\nCertainly, he could not hope to discover in others aspirations and\naversions similar to his own, could not expect companionship with an\nintelligence exulting in a studious decrepitude, nor anticipate\nmeeting a mind as keen as his among the writers and scholars.\n\nIrritated, ill at ease and offended by the poverty of ideas given and\nreceived, he became like those people described by Nicole--those who\nare always melancholy. He would fly into a rage when he read the\npatriotic and social balderdash retailed daily in the newspapers, and\nwould exaggerate the significance of the plaudits which a sovereign\npublic always reserves for works deficient in ideas and style.\n\nAlready, he was dreaming of a refined solitude, a comfortable desert,\na motionless ark in which to seek refuge from the unending deluge of\nhuman stupidity.\n\nA single passion, woman, might have curbed his contempt, but that,\ntoo, had palled on him. He had taken to carnal repasts with the\neagerness of a crotchety man affected with a depraved appetite and\ngiven to sudden hungers, whose taste is quickly dulled and surfeited.\nAssociating with country squires, he had taken part in their lavish\nsuppers where, at dessert, tipsy women would unfasten their clothing\nand strike their heads against the tables; he had haunted the green\nrooms, loved actresses and singers, endured, in addition to the\nnatural stupidity he had come to expect of women, the maddening vanity\nof female strolling players. Finally, satiated and weary of this\nmonotonous extravagance and the sameness of their caresses, he had\nplunged into the foul depths, hoping by the contrast of squalid misery\nto revive his desires and stimulate his deadened senses.\n\nWhatever he attempted proved vain; an unconquerable ennui oppressed\nhim. Yet he persisted in his excesses and returned to the perilous\nembraces of accomplished mistresses. But his health failed, his\nnervous system collapsed, the back of his neck grew sensitive, his\nhand, still firm when it seized a heavy object, trembled when it held\na tiny glass.\n\nThe physicians whom he consulted frightened him. It was high time to\ncheck his excesses and renounce those pursuits which were dissipating\nhis reserve of strength! For a while he was at peace, but his brain\nsoon became over-excited. Like those young girls who, in the grip of\npuberty, crave coarse and vile foods, he dreamed of and practiced\nperverse loves and pleasures. This was the end! As though satisfied\nwith having exhausted everything, as though completely surrendering to\nfatigue, his senses fell into a lethargy and impotence threatened him.\n\nHe recovered, but he was lonely, tired, sobered, imploring an end to\nhis life which the cowardice of his flesh prevented him from\nconsummating.\n\nOnce more he was toying with the idea of becoming a recluse, of living\nin some hushed retreat where the turmoil of life would be muffled--as\nin those streets covered with straw to prevent any sound from reaching\ninvalids.\n\nIt was time to make up his mind. The condition of his finances\nterrified him. He had spent, in acts of folly and in drinking bouts,\nthe greater part of his patrimony, and the remainder, invested in\nland, produced a ridiculously small income.\n\nHe decided to sell the Chateau de Lourps, which he no longer visited\nand where he left no memory or regret behind. He liquidated his other\nholdings, bought government bonds and in this way drew an annual\ninterest of fifty thousand francs; in addition, he reserved a sum of\nmoney which he meant to use in buying and furnishing the house where\nhe proposed to enjoy a perfect repose.\n\nExploring the suburbs of the capital, he found a place for sale at the\ntop of Fontenay-aux-Roses, in a secluded section near the fort, far\nfrom any neighbors. His dream was realized! In this country place so\nlittle violated by Parisians, he could be certain of seclusion. The\ndifficulty of reaching the place, due to an unreliable railroad\npassing by at the end of the town, and to the little street cars which\ncame and went at irregular intervals, reassured him. He could picture\nhimself alone on the bluff, sufficiently far away to prevent the\nParisian throngs from reaching him, and yet near enough to the capital\nto confirm him in his solitude. And he felt that in not entirely\nclosing the way, there was a chance that he would not be assailed by a\nwish to return to society, seeing that it is only the impossible, the\nunachievable that arouses desire.\n\nHe put masons to work on the house he had acquired. Then, one day,\ninforming no one of his plans, he quickly disposed of his old\nfurniture, dismissed his servants, and left without giving the\nconcierge any address.\n\n\n\n\n    Chapter 2\n\n\nMore than two months passed before Des Esseintes could bury himself in\nthe silent repose of his Fontenay abode. He was obliged to go to Paris\nagain, to comb the city in his search for the things he wanted to buy.\n\nWhat care he took, what meditations he surrendered himself to, before\nturning over his house to the upholsterers!\n\nHe had long been a connoisseur in the sincerities and evasions of\ncolor-tones. In the days when he had entertained women at his home, he\nhad created a boudoir where, amid daintily carved furniture of pale,\nJapanese camphor-wood, under a sort of pavillion of Indian rose-tinted\nsatin, the flesh would color delicately in the borrowed lights of the\nsilken hangings.\n\nThis room, each of whose sides was lined with mirrors that echoed each\nother all along the walls, reflecting, as far as the eye could reach,\nwhole series of rose boudoirs, had been celebrated among the women who\nloved to immerse their nudity in this bath of warm carnation, made\nfragrant with the odor of mint emanating from the exotic wood of the\nfurniture.\n\nAside from the sensual delights for which he had designed this\nchamber, this painted atmosphere which gave new color to faces grown\ndull and withered by the use of ceruse and by nights of dissipation,\nthere were other, more personal and perverse pleasures which he\nenjoyed in these languorous surroundings,--pleasures which in some way\nstimulated memories of his past pains and dead ennuis.\n\nAs a souvenir of the hated days of his childhood, he had suspended\nfrom the ceiling a small silver-wired cage where a captive cricket\nsang as if in the ashes of the chimneys of the Chateau de Lourps.\nListening to the sound he had so often heard before, he lived over\nagain the silent evenings spent near his mother, the wretchedness of\nhis suffering, repressed youth. And then, while he yielded to the\nvoluptuousness of the woman he mechanically caressed, whose words or\nlaughter tore him from his revery and rudely recalled him to the\nmoment, to the boudoir, to reality, a tumult arose in his soul, a need\nof avenging the sad years he had endured, a mad wish to sully the\nrecollections of his family by shameful action, a furious desire to\npant on cushions of flesh, to drain to their last dregs the most\nviolent of carnal vices.\n\nOn rainy autumnal days when melancholy oppressed him, when a hatred of\nhis home, the muddy yellow skies, the macadam clouds assailed him, he\ntook refuge in this retreat, set the cage lightly in motion and\nwatched it endlessly reflected in the play of the mirrors, until it\nseemed to his dazed eyes that the cage no longer stirred, but that the\nboudoir reeled and turned, filling the house with a rose-colored\nwaltz.\n\nIn the days when he had deemed it necessary to affect singularity, Des\nEsseintes had designed marvelously strange furnishings, dividing his\nsalon into a series of alcoves hung with varied tapestries to relate\nby a subtle analogy, by a vague harmony of joyous or sombre, delicate\nor barbaric colors to the character of the Latin or French books he\nloved. And he would seclude himself in turn in the particular recess\nwhose _decor_ seemed best to correspond with the very essence of the\nwork his caprice of the moment induced him to read.\n\nHe had constructed, too, a lofty high room intended for the reception\nof his tradesmen. Here they were ushered in and seated alongside each\nother in church pews, while from a pulpit he preached to them a sermon\non dandyism, adjuring his bootmakers and tailors implicitly to obey\nhis briefs in the matter of style, threatening them with pecuniary\nexcommunication if they failed to follow to the letter the\ninstructions contained in his monitories and bulls.\n\nHe acquired the reputation of an eccentric, which he enhanced by\nwearing costumes of white velvet, and gold-embroidered waistcoats, by\ninserting, in place of a cravat, a Parma bouquet in the opening of his\nshirt, by giving famous dinners to men of letters, one of which, a\nrevival of the eighteenth century, celebrating the most futile of his\nmisadventures, was a funeral repast.\n\nIn the dining room, hung in black and opening on the transformed\ngarden with its ash-powdered walks, its little pool now bordered with\nbasalt and filled with ink, its clumps of cypresses and pines, the\ndinner had been served on a table draped in black, adorned with\nbaskets of violets and scabiouses, lit by candelabra from which green\nflames blazed, and by chandeliers from which wax tapers flared.\n\nTo the sound of funeral marches played by a concealed orchestra, nude\nnegresses, wearing slippers and stockings of silver cloth with\npatterns of tears, served the guests.\n\nOut of black-edged plates they had drunk turtle soup and eaten Russian\nrye bread, ripe Turkish olives, caviar, smoked Frankfort black\npudding, game with sauces that were the color of licorice and\nblacking, truffle gravy, chocolate cream, puddings, nectarines, grape\npreserves, mulberries and black-heart cherries; they had sipped, out\nof dark glasses, wines from Limagne, Roussillon, Tenedos, Val de Penas\nand Porto, and after the coffee and walnut brandy had partaken of kvas\nand porter and stout.\n\nThe farewell dinner to a temporarily dead virility--this was what he\nhad written on invitation cards designed like bereavement notices.\n\nBut he was done with those extravagances in which he had once gloried.\nToday, he was filled with a contempt for those juvenile displays, the\nsingular apparel, the appointments of his bizarre chambers. He\ncontented himself with planning, for his own pleasure, and no longer\nfor the astonishment of others, an interior that should be comfortable\nalthough embellished in a rare style; with building a curious, calm\nretreat to serve the needs of his future solitude.\n\nWhen the Fontenay house was in readiness, fitted up by an architect\naccording to his plans, when all that remained was to determine the\ncolor scheme, he again devoted himself to long speculations.\n\nHe desired colors whose expressiveness would be displayed in the\nartificial light of lamps. To him it mattered not at all if they were\nlifeless or crude in daylight, for it was at night that he lived,\nfeeling more completely alone then, feeling that only under the\nprotective covering of darkness did the mind grow really animated and\nactive. He also experienced a peculiar pleasure in being in a richly\nilluminated room, the only patch of light amid the shadow-haunted,\nsleeping houses. This was a form of enjoyment in which perhaps entered\nan element of vanity, that peculiar pleasure known to late workers\nwhen, drawing aside the window curtains, they perceive that everything\nabout them is extinguished, silent, dead.\n\nSlowly, one by one, he selected the colors.\n\nBlue inclines to a false green by candle light: if it is dark, like\ncobalt or indigo, it turns black; if it is bright, it turns grey; if\nit is soft, like turquoise, it grows feeble and faded.\n\nThere could be no question of making it the dominant note of a room\nunless it were blended with some other color.\n\nIron grey always frowns and is heavy; pearl grey loses its blue and\nchanges to a muddy white; brown is lifeless and cold; as for deep\ngreen, such as emperor or myrtle, it has the same properties as blue\nand merges into black. There remained, then, the paler greens, such as\npeacock, cinnabar or lacquer, but the light banishes their blues and\nbrings out their yellows in tones that have a false and undecided\nquality.\n\nNo need to waste thought on the salmon, the maize and rose colors\nwhose feminine associations oppose all ideas of isolation! No need to\nconsider the violet which is completely neutralized at night; only the\nred in it holds its ground--and what a red! a viscous red like the\nlees of wine. Besides, it seemed useless to employ this color, for by\nusing a certain amount of santonin, he could get an effect of violet\non his hangings.\n\nThese colors disposed of, only three remained: red, orange, yellow.\n\nOf these, he preferred orange, thus by his own example confirming the\ntruth of a theory which he declared had almost mathematical\ncorrectness--the theory that a harmony exists between the sensual\nnature of a truly artistic individual and the color which most vividly\nimpresses him.\n\nDisregarding entirely the generality of men whose gross retinas are\ncapable of perceiving neither the cadence peculiar to each color nor\nthe mysterious charm of their nuances of light and shade; ignoring the\nbourgeoisie, whose eyes are insensible to the pomp and splendor of\nstrong, vibrant tones; and devoting himself only to people with\nsensitive pupils, refined by literature and art, he was convinced that\nthe eyes of those among them who dream of the ideal and demand\nillusions are generally caressed by blue and its derivatives, mauve,\nlilac and pearl grey, provided always that these colors remain soft\nand do not overstep the bounds where they lose their personalities by\nbeing transformed into pure violets and frank greys.\n\nThose persons, on the contrary, who are energetic and incisive, the\nplethoric, red-blooded, strong males who fling themselves unthinkingly\ninto the affair of the moment, generally delight in the bold gleams of\nyellows and reds, the clashing cymbals of vermilions and chromes that\nblind and intoxicate them.\n\nBut the eyes of enfeebled and nervous persons whose sensual appetites\ncrave highly seasoned foods, the eyes of hectic and over-excited\ncreatures have a predilection toward that irritating and morbid color\nwith its fictitious splendors, its acid fevers--orange.\n\nThus, there could be no question about Des Esseintes' choice, but\nunquestionable difficulties still arose. If red and yellow are\nheightened by light, the same does not always hold true of their\ncompound, orange, which often seems to ignite and turns to nasturtium,\nto a flaming red.\n\nHe studied all their nuances by candlelight, discovering a shade\nwhich, it seemed to him, would not lose its dominant tone, but would\nstand every test required of it. These preliminaries completed, he\nsought to refrain from using, for his study at least, oriental stuffs\nand rugs which have become cheapened and ordinary, now that rich\nmerchants can easily pick them up at auctions and shops.\n\nHe finally decided to bind his walls, like books, with coarse-grained\nmorocco, with Cape skin, polished by strong steel plates under a\npowerful press.\n\nWhen the wainscoting was finished, he had the moulding and high\nplinths painted in indigo, a lacquered indigo like that which\ncoachmakers employ for carriage panels. The ceiling, slightly rounded,\nwas also lined with morocco. In the center was a wide opening\nresembling an immense bull's eye encased in orange skin--a circle of\nthe firmament worked out on a background of king blue silk on which\nwere woven silver seraphim with out-stretched wings. This material had\nlong before been embroidered by the Cologne guild of weavers for an\nold cope.\n\nThe setting was complete. At night the room subsided into a restful,\nsoothing harmony. The wainscoting preserved its blue which seemed\nsustained and warmed by the orange. And the orange remained pure,\nstrengthened and fanned as it was by the insistent breath of the\nblues.\n\nDes Esseintes was not deeply concerned about the furniture itself. The\nonly luxuries in the room were books and rare flowers. He limited\nhimself to these things, intending later on to hang a few drawings or\npaintings on the panels which remained bare; to place shelves and book\nracks of ebony around the walls; to spread the pelts of wild beasts\nand the skins of blue fox on the floor; to install, near a massive\nfifteenth century counting-table, deep armchairs and an old chapel\nreading-desk of forged iron, one of those old lecterns on which the\ndeacon formerly placed the antiphonary and which now supported one of\nthe heavy folios of Du Cange's _Glossarium mediae et infimae\nlatinitatis_.\n\nThe windows whose blue fissured panes, stippled with fragments of\ngold-edged bottles, intercepted the view of the country and only\npermitted a faint light to enter, were draped with curtains cut from\nold stoles of dark and reddish gold neutralized by an almost dead\nrusset woven in the pattern.\n\nThe mantel shelf was sumptuously draped with the remnant of a\nFlorentine dalmatica. Between two gilded copper monstrances of\nByzantine style, originally brought from the old Abbaye-au-Bois de\nBievre, stood a marvelous church canon divided into three separate\ncompartments delicately wrought like lace work. It contained, under\nits glass frame, three works of Baudelaire copied on real vellum, with\nwonderful missal letters and splendid coloring: to the right and left,\nthe sonnets bearing the titles of _La Mort des Amants_ and _L'Ennemi_;\nin the center, the prose poem entitled, _Anywhere Out of the\nWorld--n'importe ou, hors du monde_.\n\n\n\n\n    Chapter 3\n\n\nAfter selling his effects, Des Esseintes retained the two old\ndomestics who had tended his mother and filled the offices of steward\nand house porter at the Chateau de Lourps, which had remained deserted\nand uninhabited until its disposal.\n\nThese servants he brought to Fontenay. They were accustomed to the\nregular life of hospital attendants hourly serving the patients their\nstipulated food and drink, to the rigid silence of cloistral monks who\nlive behind barred doors and windows, having no communication with the\noutside world.\n\nThe man was assigned the task of keeping the house in order and of\nprocuring provisions, the woman that of preparing the food. He\nsurrendered the second story to them, forced them to wear heavy felt\ncoverings over their shoes, put sound mufflers along the well-oiled\ndoors and covered their floor with heavy rugs so that he would never\nhear their footsteps overhead.\n\nHe devised an elaborate signal code of bells whereby his wants were\nmade known. He pointed out the exact spot on his bureau where they\nwere to place the account book each month while he slept. In short,\nmatters were arranged in such wise that he would not be obliged to see\nor to converse with them very often.\n\nNevertheless, since the woman had occasion to walk past the house so\nas to reach the woodshed, he wished to make sure that her shadow, as\nshe passed his windows, would not offend him. He had designed for her\na costume of Flemish silk with a white bonnet and large, black,\nlowered hood, such as is still worn by the nuns of Ghent. The shadow\nof this headdress, in the twilight, gave him the sensation of being in\na cloister, brought back memories of silent, holy villages, dead\nquarters enclosed and buried in some quiet corner of a bustling town.\n\nThe hours of eating were also regulated. His instructions in this\nregard were short and explicit, for the weakened state of his stomach\nno longer permitted him to absorb heavy or varied foods.\n\nIn winter, at five o'clock in the afternoon, when the day was drawing\nto a close, he breakfasted on two boiled eggs, toast and tea. At\neleven o'clock he dined. During the night he drank coffee, and\nsometimes tea and wine, and at five o'clock in the morning, before\nretiring, he supped again lightly.\n\nHis meals, which were planned and ordered once for all at the\nbeginning of each season, were served him on a table in the middle of\na small room separated from his study by a padded corridor,\nhermetically sealed so as to permit neither sound nor odor to filter\ninto either of the two rooms it joined.\n\nWith its vaulted ceiling fitted with beams in a half circle, its\nbulkheads and floor of pine, and the little window in the wainscoting\nthat looked like a porthole, the dining room resembled the cabin of a\nship.\n\nLike those Japanese boxes which fit into each other, this room was\ninserted in a larger apartment--the real dining room constructed by\nthe architect.\n\nIt was pierced by two windows. One of them was invisible, hidden by a\npartition which could, however, be lowered by a spring so as to permit\nfresh air to circulate around this pinewood box and to penetrate into\nit. The other was visible, placed directly opposite the porthole built\nin the wainscoting, but it was blocked up. For a long aquarium\noccupied the entire space between the porthole and the genuine window\nplaced in the outer wall. Thus the light, in order to brighten the\nroom, traversed the window, whose panes had been replaced by a plate\nglass, the water, and, lastly, the window of the porthole.\n\nIn autumn, at sunset, when the steam rose from the samovar on the\ntable, the water of the aquarium, wan and glassy all during the\nmorning, reddened like blazing gleams of embers and lapped restlessly\nagainst the light-colored wood.\n\nSometimes, when it chanced that Des Esseintes was awake in the\nafternoon, he operated the stops of the pipes and conduits which\nemptied the aquarium, replacing it with pure water. Into this, he\npoured drops of colored liquids that made it green or brackish,\nopaline or silvery--tones similar to those of rivers which reflect the\ncolor of the sky, the intensity of the sun, the menace of rain--which\nreflect, in a word, the state of the season and atmosphere.\n\nWhen he did this, he imagined himself on a brig, between decks, and\ncuriously he contemplated the marvelous, mechanical fish, wound like\nclocks, which passed before the porthole or clung to the artificial\nsea-weed. While he inhaled the odor of tar, introduced into the room\nshortly before his arrival, he examined colored engravings, hung on\nthe walls, which represented, just as at Lloyd's office and the\nsteamship agencies, steamers bound for Valparaiso and La Platte, and\nlooked at framed pictures on which were inscribed the itineraries of\nthe Royal Mail Steam Packet, the Lopez and the Valery Companies, the\nfreight and port calls of the Atlantic mail boats.\n\nIf he tired of consulting these guides, he could rest his eyes by\ngazing at the chronometers and sea compasses, the sextants, field\nglasses and cards strewn on a table on which stood a single volume,\nbound in sealskin. The book was \"The Adventures of Arthur Gordon Pym\",\nspecially printed for him on laid paper, each sheet carefully\nselected, with a sea-gull watermark.\n\nOr, he could look at fishing rods, tan-colored nets, rolls of russet\nsail, a tiny, black-painted cork anchor--all thrown in a heap near the\ndoor communicating with the kitchen by a passage furnished with\ncappadine silk which reabsorbed, just as in the corridor which\nconnected the dining room with his study, every odor and sound.\n\nThus, without stirring, he enjoyed the rapid motions of a long sea\nvoyage. The pleasure of travel, which only exists as a matter of fact\nin retrospect and seldom in the present, at the instant when it is\nbeing experienced, he could fully relish at his ease, without the\nnecessity of fatigue or confusion, here in this cabin whose studied\ndisorder, whose transitory appearance and whose seemingly temporary\nfurnishings corresponded so well with the briefness of the time he\nspent there on his meals, and contrasted so perfectly with his study,\na well-arranged, well-furnished room where everything betokened a\nretired, orderly existence.\n\nMovement, after all, seemed futile to him. He felt that imagination\ncould easily be substituted for the vulgar realities of things. It was\npossible, in his opinion, to gratify the most extravagant, absurd\ndesires by a subtle subterfuge, by a slight modification of the object\nof one's wishes. Every epicure nowadays enjoys, in restaurants\ncelebrated for the excellence of their cellars, wines of capital taste\nmanufactured from inferior brands treated by Pasteur's method. For\nthey have the same aroma, the same color, the same bouquet as the rare\nwines of which they are an imitation, and consequently the pleasure\nexperienced in sipping them is identical. The originals, moreover, are\nusually unprocurable, for love or money.\n\nTransposing this insidious deviation, this adroit deceit into the\nrealm of the intellect, there was not the shadow of a doubt that\nfanciful delights resembling the true in every detail, could be\nenjoyed. One could revel, for instance, in long explorations while\nnear one's own fireside, stimulating the restive or sluggish mind, if\nneed be, by reading some suggestive narrative of travel in distant\nlands. One could enjoy the beneficent results of a sea bath, too, even\nin Paris. All that is necessary is to visit the Vigier baths situated\nin a boat on the Seine, far from the shore.\n\nThere, the illusion of the sea is undeniable, imperious, positive. It\nis achieved by salting the water of the bath; by mixing, according to\nthe Codex formula, sulphate of soda, hydrochlorate of magnesia and\nlime; by extracting from a box, carefully closed by means of a screw,\na ball of thread or a very small piece of cable which had been\nspecially procured from one of those great rope-making establishments\nwhose vast warehouses and basements are heavy with odors of the sea\nand the port; by inhaling these perfumes held by the ball or the cable\nend; by consulting an exact photograph of the casino; by eagerly\nreading the Joanne guide describing the beauties of the seashore where\none would wish to be; by being rocked on the waves, made by the eddy\nof fly boats lapping against the pontoon of baths; by listening to the\nplaint of the wind under the arches, or to the hollow murmur of the\nomnibuses passing above on the Port Royal, two steps away.\n\nThe secret lies in knowing how to proceed, how to concentrate deeply\nenough to produce the hallucination and succeed in substituting the\ndream reality for the reality itself.\n\nArtifice, besides, seemed to Des Esseintes the final distinctive mark\nof man's genius.\n\nNature had had her day, as he put it. By the disgusting sameness of\nher landscapes and skies, she had once for all wearied the considerate\npatience of aesthetes. Really, what dullness! the dullness of the\nspecialist confined to his narrow work. What manners! the manners of\nthe tradesman offering one particular ware to the exclusion of all\nothers. What a monotonous storehouse of fields and trees! What a banal\nagency of mountains and seas!\n\nThere is not one of her inventions, no matter how subtle or imposing\nit may be, which human genius cannot create; no Fontainebleau forest,\nno moonlight which a scenic setting flooded with electricity cannot\nproduce; no waterfall which hydraulics cannot imitate to perfection;\nno rock which pasteboard cannot be made to resemble; no flower which\ntaffetas and delicately painted papers cannot simulate.\n\nThere can be no doubt about it: this eternal, driveling, old woman is\nno longer admired by true artists, and the moment has come to replace\nher by artifice.\n\nClosely observe that work of hers which is considered the most\nexquisite, that creation of hers whose beauty is everywhere conceded\nthe most perfect and original--woman. Has not man made, for his own\nuse, an animated and artificial being which easily equals woman, from\nthe point of view of plastic beauty? Is there a woman, whose form is\nmore dazzling, more splendid than the two locomotives that pass over\nthe Northern Railroad lines?\n\nOne, the Crampton, is an adorable, shrill-voiced blonde, a trim,\ngilded blonde, with a large, fragile body imprisoned in a glittering\ncorset of copper, and having the long, sinewy lines of a cat. Her\nextraordinary grace is frightening, as, with the sweat of her hot\nsides rising upwards and her steel muscles stiffening, she puts in\nmotion the immense rose-window of her fine wheels and darts forward,\nmettlesome, along rapids and floods.\n\nThe other, the Engerth, is a nobly proportioned dusky brunette\nemitting raucous, muffled cries. Her heavy loins are strangled in a\ncast-iron breast-plate. A monstrous beast with a disheveled mane of\nblack smoke and with six low, coupled wheels! What irresistible power\nshe has when, causing the earth to tremble, she slowly and heavily\ndrags the unwieldy queue of her merchandise!\n\nUnquestionably, there is not one among the frail blondes and majestic\nbrunettes of the flesh that can vie with their delicate grace and\nterrific strength.\n\nSuch were Des Esseintes' reflections when the breeze brought him the\nfaint whistle of the toy railroad winding playfully, like a spinning\ntop, between Paris and Sceaux. His house was situated at a twenty\nminutes' walk from the Fontenay station, but the height on which it\nwas perched, its isolation, made it immune to the clatter of the noisy\nrabble which the vicinity of a railway station invariably attracts on\na Sunday.\n\nAs for the village itself, he hardly knew it. One night he had gazed\nthrough his window at the silent landscape which slowly unfolded, as\nit dipped to the foot of a slope, on whose summit the batteries of the\nVerrieres woods were trained.\n\nIn the darkness, to left and right, these masses, dim and confused,\nrose tier on tier, dominated far off by other batteries and forts\nwhose high embankments seemed, in the moonlight, bathed in silver\nagainst the sombre sky.\n\nWhere the plain did not fall under the shadow of the hills, it seemed\npowdered with starch and smeared with white cold cream. In the warm\nair that fanned the faded grasses and exhaled a spicy perfume, the\ntrees, chalky white under the moon, shook their pale leaves, and\nseemed to divide their trunks, whose shadows formed bars of black on\nthe plaster-like ground where pebbles scintillated like glittering\nplates.\n\nBecause of its enameled look and its artificial air, the landscape did\nnot displease Des Esseintes. But since that afternoon spent at\nFontenay in search of a house, he had never ventured along its roads\nin daylight. The verdure of this region inspired him with no interest\nwhatever, for it did not have the delicate and doleful charm of the\nsickly and pathetic vegetation which forces its way painfully through\nthe rubbish heaps of the mounds which had once served as the ramparts\nof Paris. That day, in the village, he had perceived corpulent,\nbewhiskered _bourgeois_ citizens and moustached uniformed men with\nheads of magistrates and soldiers, which they held as stiffly as\nmonstrances in churches. And ever since that encounter, his\ndetestation of the human face had been augmented.\n\nDuring the last month of his stay in Paris, when he was weary of\neverything, afflicted with hypochondria, the prey of melancholia, when\nhis nerves had become so sensitive that the sight of an unpleasant\nobject or person impressed itself deeply on his brain--so deeply that\nseveral days were required before the impression could be effaced--the\ntouch of a human body brushing against him in the street had been an\nexcruciating agony.\n\nThe very sight of certain faces made him suffer. He considered the\ncrabbed expressions of some, insulting. He felt a desire to slap the\nfellow who walked, eyes closed, with such a learned air; the one who\nminced along, smiling at his image in the window panes; and the one\nwho seemed stimulated by a whole world of thought while devouring,\nwith contracted brow, the tedious contents of a newspaper.\n\nSuch an inveterate stupidity, such a scorn for literature and art,\nsuch a hatred for all the ideas he worshipped, were implanted and\nanchored in these merchant minds, exclusively preoccupied with the\nbusiness of swindling and money-making, and accessible only to ideas\nof politics--that base distraction of mediocrities--that he returned\nenraged to his home and locked himself in with his books.\n\nHe hated the new generation with all the energy in him. They were\nfrightful clodhoppers who seemed to find it necessary to talk and\nlaugh boisterously in restaurants and cafes. They jostled you on\nsidewalks without begging pardon. They pushed the wheels of their\nperambulators against your legs, without even apologizing.\n\n\n\n\n    Chapter 4\n\n\nA portion of the shelves which lined the walls of his orange and blue\nstudy was devoted exclusively to those Latin works assigned to the\ngeneric period of \"The Decadence\" by those whose minds have absorbed\nthe deplorable teachings of the Sorbonne.\n\nThe Latin written in that era which professors still persist in\ncalling the Great Age, hardly stimulated Des Esseintes. With its\ncarefully premeditated style, its sameness, its stripping of supple\nsyntax, its poverty of color and nuance, this language, pruned of all\nthe rugged and often rich expressions of the preceding ages, was\nconfined to the enunciation of the majestic banalities, the empty\ncommonplaces tiresomely reiterated by the rhetoricians and poets; but\nit betrayed such a lack of curiosity and such a humdrum tediousness,\nsuch a drabness, feebleness and jaded solemnity that to find its\nequal, it was necessary, in linguistic studies, to go to the French\nstyle of the period of Louis XIV.\n\nThe gentle Vergil, whom instructors call the Mantuan swan, perhaps\nbecause he was not born in that city, he considered one of the most\nterrible pedants ever produced by antiquity. Des Esseintes was\nexasperated by his immaculate and bedizened shepherds, his Orpheus\nwhom he compares to a weeping nightingale, his Aristaeus who simpers\nabout bees, his Aeneas, that weak-willed, irresolute person who walks\nwith wooden gestures through the length of the poem. Des Esseintes\nwould gladly have accepted the tedious nonsense which those\nmarionettes exchange with each other off-stage; or even the poet's\nimpudent borrowings from Homer, Theocritus, Ennius and Lucretius; the\nplain theft, revealed to us by Macrobius, of the second song of the\n_Aeneid_, copied almost word for word from one of Pisander's poems; in\nfine, all the unutterable emptiness of this heap of verses. The thing\nhe could not forgive, however, and which infuriated him most, was the\nworkmanship of the hexameters, beating like empty tin cans and\nextending their syllabic quantities measured according to the\nunchanging rule of a pedantic and dull prosody. He disliked the\ntexture of those stiff verses, in their official garb, their abject\nreverence for grammar, their mechanical division by imperturbable\ncaesuras, always plugged at the end in the same way by the impact of a\ndactyl against a spondee.\n\nBorrowed from the perfected forge of Catullus, this unvarying\nversification, lacking imagination, lacking pity, padded with useless\nwords and refuse, with pegs of identical and anticipated assonances,\nthis ceaseless wretchedness of Homeric epithet which designates\nnothing whatever and permits nothing to be seen, all this impoverished\nvocabulary of muffled, lifeless tones bored him beyond measure.\n\nIt is no more than just to add that, if his admiration for Vergil was\nquite restrained, and his attraction for Ovid's lucid outpourings even\nmore circumspect, there was no limit to his disgust at the elephantine\ngraces of Horace, at the prattle of this hopeless lout who smirkingly\nutters the broad, crude jests of an old clown.\n\nNeither was he pleased, in prose, with the verbosities, the redundant\nmetaphors, the ludicrous digressions of Cicero. There was nothing to\nbeguile him in the boasting of his apostrophes, in the flow of his\npatriotic nonsense, in the emphasis of his harangues, in the\nponderousness of his style, fleshy but ropy and lacking in marrow and\nbone, in the insupportable dross of his long adverbs with which he\nintroduces phrases, in the unalterable formula of his adipose periods\nbadly sewed together with the thread of conjunctions and, finally, in\nhis wearisome habits of tautology. Nor was his enthusiasm wakened for\nCaesar, celebrated for his laconic style. Here, on the contrary, was\ndisclosed a surprising aridity, a sterility of recollection, an\nincredibly undue constipation.\n\nHe found pasture neither among them nor among those writers who are\npeculiarly the delight of the spuriously literate: Sallust, who is\nless colorless than the others; sentimental and pompous Titus Livius;\nturgid and lurid Seneca; watery and larval Suetonius; Tacitus who, in\nhis studied conciseness, is the keenest, most wiry and muscular of\nthem all. In poetry, he was untouched by Juvenal, despite some\nroughshod verses, and by Persius, despite his mysterious insinuations.\nIn neglecting Tibullus and Propertius, Quintilian and the Plinies,\nStatius, Martial, even Terence and Plautus whose jargon full of\nneologisms, compound words and diminutives, could please him, but\nwhose low comedy and gross humor he loathed, Des Esseintes only began\nto be interested in the Latin language with Lucan. Here it was\nliberated, already more expressive and less dull. This careful armor,\nthese verses plated with enamel and studded with jewels, captivated\nhim, but the exclusive preoccupation with form, the sonorities of\ntone, the clangor of metals, did not entirely conceal from him the\nemptiness of the thought, the turgidity of those blisters which emboss\nthe skin of the _Pharsale_.\n\nPetronius was the author whom he truly loved and who caused him\nforever to abandon the sonorous ingenuities of Lucan, for he was a\nkeen observer, a delicate analyst, a marvelous painter. Tranquilly,\nwithout prejudice or hate, he described Rome's daily life, recounting\nthe customs of his epoch in the sprightly little chapters of the\n_Satyricon_.\n\nObserving the facts of life, stating them in clear, definite form, he\nrevealed the petty existence of the people, their happenings, their\nbestialities, their passions.\n\nOne glimpses the inspector of furnished lodgings who has inquired\nafter the newly arrived travellers; bawdy houses where men prowl\naround nude women, while through the half-open doors of the rooms\ncouples can be seen in dalliance; the society of the time, in villas\nof an insolent luxury, a revel of richness and magnificence, or in the\npoor quarters with their rumpled, bug-ridden folding-beds; impure\nsharpers, like Ascylte and Eumolpe in search of a rich windfall; old\nincubi with tucked-up dresses and plastered cheeks of white lead and\nred acacia; plump, curled, depraved little girls of sixteen; women who\nare the prey of hysterical attacks; hunters of heritages offering\ntheir sons and daughters to debauched testators. All pass across the\npages. They debate in the streets, rub elbows in the baths, beat each\nother unmercifully as in a pantomime.\n\nAnd all this recounted in a style of strange freshness and precise\ncolor, drawing from all dialects, borrowing expressions from all the\nlanguages that were drifting into Rome, extending all the limits,\nremoving all the handicaps of the so-called Great Age. He made each\nperson speak his own idiom: the uneducated freedmen, the vulgar Latin\nargot of the streets; the strangers, their barbarous patois, the\ncorrupt speech of the African, Syrian and Greek; imbecile pedants,\nlike the Agamemnon of the book, a rhetoric of artificial words. These\npeople are depicted with swift strokes, wallowing around tables,\nexchanging stupid, drunken speech, uttering senile maxims and inept\nproverbs.\n\nThis realistic novel, this slice of Roman life, without any\npreoccupation, whatever one may say of it, with reform and satire,\nwithout the need of any studied end, or of morality; this story\nwithout intrigue or action, portraying the adventures of evil persons,\nanalyzing with a calm finesse the joys and sorrows of these lovers and\ncouples, depicting life in a splendidly wrought language without\nsurrendering himself to any commentary, without approving or cursing\nthe acts and thoughts of his characters, the vices of a decrepit\ncivilization, of an empire that cracks, struck Des Esseintes. In the\nkeenness of the observation, in the firmness of the method, he found\nsingular comparisons, curious analogies with the few modern French\nnovels he could endure.\n\nCertainly, he bitterly regretted the _Eustion_ and the _Albutiae_,\nthose two works by Petronius mentioned by Planciade Fulgence which are\nforever lost. But the bibliophile in him consoled the student, when he\ntouched with worshipful hands the superb edition of the _Satyricon_\nwhich he possessed, the octavo bearing the date 1585 and the name of\nJ. Dousa of Leyden.\n\nLeaving Petronius, his Latin collection entered into the second\ncentury of the Christian era, passed over Fronto, the declaimer, with\nhis antiquated terms; skipped the _Attic Nights_ of Aulus Gellius, his\ndisciple and friend,--a clever, ferreting mind, but a writer entangled\nin a glutinous vase; and halted at Apuleius, of whose works he owned\nthe first edition printed at Rome in 1469.\n\nThis African delighted him. The Latin language was at its richest in\nthe _Metamorphoses_; it contained ooze and rubbish-strewn water\nrushing from all the provinces, and the refuse mingled and was\nconfused in a bizarre, exotic, almost new color. Mannerisms, new\ndetails of Latin society found themselves shaped into neologisms\nspecially created for the needs of conversation, in a Roman corner of\nAfrica. He was amused by the southern exuberance and joviality of a\ndoubtlessly corpulent man. He seemed a salacious, gay crony compared\nwith the Christian apologists who lived in the same century--the\nsoporific Minucius Felix, a pseudo-classicist, pouring forth the still\nthick emulsions of Cicero into his _Octavius_; nay, even\nTertullian--whom he perhaps preserved for his Aldine edition, more\nthan for the work itself.\n\nAlthough he was sufficiently versed in theology, the disputes of the\nMontanists against the Catholic Church, the polemics against the\ngnostics, left him cold. Despite Tertullian's curious, concise style\nfull of ambiguous terms, resting on participles, clashing with\noppositions, bristling with puns and witticisms, dappled with vocables\nculled from the juridical science and the language of the Fathers of\nthe Greek Church, he now hardly ever opened the _Apologetica_ and the\n_Treatise on Patience_. At the most, he read several pages of _De\nculta feminarum_, where Tertullian counsels women not to bedeck\nthemselves with jewels and precious stuffs, forbidding them the use of\ncosmetics, because these attempt to correct and improve nature.\n\nThese ideas, diametrically opposed to his own, made him smile. Then\nthe role played by Tertullian, in his Carthage bishopric, seemed to\nhim suggestive in pleasant reveries. More even than his works did the\nman attract him.\n\nHe had, in fact, lived in stormy times, agitated by frightful\ndisorders, under Caracalla, under Macrinus, under the astonishing High\nPriest of Emesa, Elagabalus, and he tranquilly prepared his sermons,\nhis dogmatic writings, his pleadings, his homelies, while the Roman\nEmpire shook on its foundations, while the follies of Asia, while the\nordures of paganism were full to the brim. With the utmost sang-froid,\nhe recommended carnal abstinence, frugality in food, sobriety in\ndress, while, walking in silver powder and golden sand, a tiara on his\nhead, his garb figured with precious stones, Elagabalus worked, amid\nhis eunuchs, at womanish labor, calling himself the Empress and\nchanging, every night, his Emperor, whom he preferably chose among\nbarbers, scullions and circus drivers.\n\nThis antithesis delighted him. Then the Latin language, arrived at its\nsupreme maturity under Petronius, commenced to decay; the Christian\nliterature replaced it, bringing new words with new ideas, unemployed\nconstructions, strange verbs, adjectives with subtle meanings,\nabstract words until then rare in the Roman language and whose usage\nTertullian had been one of the first to adopt.\n\nBut there was no attraction in this dissolution, continued after\nTertullian's death by his pupil, Saint Cyprian, by Arnobius and by\nLactantius. There was something lacking; it made clumsy returns to\nCiceronian magniloquence, but had not yet acquired that special flavor\nwhich in the fourth century, and particularly during the centuries\nfollowing, the odor of Christianity would give the pagan tongue,\ndecomposed like old venison, crumbling at the same time that the old\nworld civilization collapsed, and the Empires, putrefied by the sanies\nof the centuries, succumbed to the thrusts of the barbarians.\n\nOnly one Christian poet, Commodianus, represented the third century in\nhis library. The _Carmen apologeticum_, written in 259, is a\ncollection of instructions, twisted into acrostics, in popular\nhexameters, with caesuras introduced according to the heroic verse\nstyle, composed without regard to quantity or hiatus and often\naccompanied by such rhymes as the Church Latin would later supply in\nsuch abundance.\n\nThese sombre, tortuous, gamy verses, crammed with terms of ordinary\nspeech, with words diverted from their primitive meaning, claimed and\ninterested him even more than the soft and already green style of the\nhistorians, Ammianus Marcellinus and Aurelius Victorus, Symmachus the\nletter writer, and Macrobius the grammarian and compiler. Them he even\npreferred to the genuinely scanned lines, the spotted and superb\nlanguage of Claudian, Rutilius and Ausonius.\n\nThey were then the masters of art. They filled the dying Empire with\ntheir cries; the Christian Ausonius with his _Centon Nuptial_, and his\nexuberant, embellished _Mosella_; Rutilius, with his hymns to the\nglory of Rome, his anathemas against the Jews and the monks, his\njourney from Italy into Gaul and the impressions recorded along the\nway, the intervals of landscape reflected in the water, the mirage of\nvapors and the movement of mists that enveloped the mountains.\n\nClaudian, a sort of avatar of Lucan, dominates the fourth century with\nthe terrible clarion of his verses: a poet forging a loud and sonorous\nhexameter, striking the epithet with a sharp blow amid sheaves of\nsparks, achieving a certain grandeur which fills his work with a\npowerful breath. In the Occidental Empire tottering more and more in\nthe perpetual menace of the Barbarians now pressing in hordes at the\nEmpire's yielding gates, he revives antiquity, sings of the abduction\nof Proserpine, lays on his vibrant colors and passes with all his\ntorches alight, into the obscurity that was then engulfing his world.\n\nPaganism again lives in his verse, sounding its last fanfare, lifting\nits last great poet above the Christianity which was soon entirely to\nsubmerge the language, and which would forever be sole master of art.\nThe new Christian spirit arose with Paulinus, disciple of Ausonius;\nJuvencus, who paraphrases the gospels in verse; Victorinus, author of\nthe _Maccabees_; Sanctus Burdigalensis who, in an eclogue imitated\nfrom Vergil, makes his shepherds Egon and Buculus lament the maladies\nof their flock; and all the saints: Hilaire of Poitiers, defender of\nthe Nicean faith, the Athanasius of the Occident, as he has been\ncalled; Ambrosius, author of the indigestible homelies, the wearisome\nChristian Cicero; Damasus, maker of lapidary epigrams; Jerome,\ntranslator of the Vulgate, and his adversary Vigilantius, who attacks\nthe cult of saints and the abuse of miracles and fastings, and already\npreaches, with arguments which future ages were to repeat, against the\nmonastic vows and celibacy of the priests.\n\nFinally, in the fifth century came Augustine, bishop of Hippo. Des\nEsseintes knew him only too well, for he was the Church's most reputed\nwriter, founder of Christian orthodoxy, considered an oracle and\nsovereign master by Catholics. He no longer opened the pages of this\nholy man's works, although he had sung his disgust of the earth in the\n_Confessions_, and although his lamenting piety had essayed, in the\n_City of God_, to mitigate the frightful distress of the times by\nsedative promises of a rosier future. When Des Esseintes had studied\ntheology, he was already sick and weary of the old monk's preachings\nand jeremiads, his theories on predestination and grace, his combats\nagainst the schisms.\n\nHe preferred to thumb the _Psychomachia_ of Prudentius, that first\ntype of the allegorical poem which was later, in the Middle Ages, to\nbe used continually, and the works of Sidonius Apollinaris whose\ncorrespondence interlarded with flashes of wit, pungencies, archaisms\nand enigmas, allured him. He willingly re-read the panegyrics in which\nthis bishop invokes pagan deities in substantiation of his\nvainglorious eulogies; and, in spite of everything, he confessed a\nweakness for the affectations of these verses, fabricated, as it were,\nby an ingenious mechanician who operates his machine, oils his wheels\nand invents intricate and useless parts.\n\nAfter Sidonius, he sought Merobaudes, the panegyrist; Sedulius, author\nof the rhymed poems and abecedarian hymns, certain passages of which\nthe Church has appropriated for its services; Marius Victorius, whose\ngloomy treatise on the _Pervesity of the Times_ is illumed, here and\nthere, with verses that gleam with phosphorescence; Paulinus of Pella,\npoet of the shivering _Eucharisticon_; and Orientius, bishop of Auch,\nwho, in the distichs of his _Monitories_, inveighs against the\nlicentiousness of women whose faces, he claims, corrupt the people.\n\nThe interest which Des Esseintes felt for the Latin language did not\npause at this period which found it drooping, thoroughly putrid,\nlosing its members and dropping its pus, and barely preserving through\nall the corruption of its body, those still firm elements which the\nChristians detached to marinate in the brine of their new language.\n\nThe second half of the fifth century had arrived, the horrible epoch\nwhen frightful motions convulsed the earth. The Barbarians sacked\nGaul. Paralyzed Rome, pillaged by the Visigoths, felt its life grow\nfeeble, perceived its extremities, the occident and the orient, writhe\nin blood and grow more exhausted from day to day.\n\nIn this general dissolution, in the successive assassination of the\nCaesars, in the turmoil of carnage from one end of Europe to another,\nthere resounded a terrible shout of triumph, stifling all clamors,\nsilencing all voices. On the banks of the Danube, thousands of men\nastride on small horses, clad in rat-skin coats, monstrous Tartars\nwith enormous heads, flat noses, chins gullied with scars and gashes,\nand jaundiced faces bare of hair, rushed at full speed to envelop the\nterritories of the Lower Empire like a whirlwind.\n\nEverything disappeared in the dust of their gallopings, in the smoke\nof the conflagrations. Darkness fell, and the amazed people trembled,\nas they heard the fearful tornado which passed with thunder crashes.\nThe hordes of Huns razed Europe, rushed toward Gaul, overran the\nplains of Chalons where Aetius pillaged it in an awful charge. The\nplains, gorged with blood, foamed like a purple sea. Two hundred\nthousand corpses barred the way, broke the movement of this avalanche\nwhich, swerving, fell with mighty thunderclaps, against Italy whose\nexterminated towns flamed like burning bricks.\n\nThe Occidental Empire crumbled beneath the shock; the moribund life\nwhich it was pursuing to imbecility and foulness, was extinguished.\nFor another reason, the end of the universe seemed near; such cities\nas had been forgotten by Attila were decimated by famine and plague.\nThe Latin language in its turn, seemed to sink under the world's\nruins.\n\nYears hastened on. The Barbarian idioms began to be modulated, to\nleave their vein-stones and form real languages. Latin, saved in the\ndebacle by the cloisters, was confined in its usage to the convents\nand monasteries.\n\nHere and there some poets gleamed, dully and coldly: the African\nDracontius with his _Hexameron_, Claudius Memertius, with his\nliturgical poetry; Avitus of Vienne; then, the biographers like\nEnnodius, who narrates the prodigies of that perspicacious and\nvenerated diplomat, Saint Epiphanius, the upright and vigilant pastor;\nor like Eugippus, who tells of the life of Saint Severin, that\nmysterious hermit and humble ascetic who appeared like an angel of\ngrace to the distressed people, mad with suffering and fear; writers\nlike Veranius of Gevaudan who prepared a little treatise on\ncontinence; like Aurelianus and Ferreolus who compiled the\necclesiastical canons; historians like Rotherius, famous for a lost\nhistory of the Huns.\n\nDes Esseintes' library did not contain many works of the centuries\nimmediately succeeding. Notwithstanding this deficiency, the sixth\ncentury was represented by Fortunatus, bishop of Poitiers, whose hymns\nand _Vexila regis_, carved out of the old carrion of the Latin\nlanguage and spiced with the aromatics of the Church, haunted him on\ncertain days; by Boethius, Gregory of Tours, and Jornandez. In the\nseventh and eighth centuries since, in addition to the low Latin of\nthe Chroniclers, the Fredegaires and Paul Diacres, and the poems\ncontained in the Bangor antiphonary which he sometimes read for the\nalphabetical and mono-rhymed hymn sung in honor of Saint Comgill, the\nliterature limited itself almost exclusively to biographies of saints,\nto the legend of Saint Columban, written by the monk, Jonas, and to\nthat of the blessed Cuthbert, written by the Venerable Bede from the\nnotes of an anonymous monk of Lindisfarn, he contented himself with\nglancing over, in his moments of tedium, the works of these\nhagiographers and in again reading several extracts from the lives of\nSaint Rusticula and Saint Radegonda, related, the one by Defensorius,\nthe other by the modest and ingenious Baudonivia, a nun of Poitiers.\n\nBut the singular works of Latin and Anglo-Saxon literature allured him\nstill further. They included the whole series of riddles by Adhelme,\nTatwine and Eusebius, who were descendants of Symphosius, and\nespecially the enigmas composed by Saint Boniface, in acrostic\nstrophes whose solution could be found in the initial letters of the\nverses.\n\nHis interest diminished with the end of those two centuries. Hardly\npleased with the cumbersome mass of Carlovingian Latinists, the\nAlcuins and the Eginhards, he contented himself, as a specimen of the\nlanguage of the ninth century, with the chronicles of Saint Gall,\nFreculfe and Reginon; with the poem of the siege of Paris written by\nAbbo le Courbe; with the didactic _Hortulus_, of the Benedictine\nWalafrid Strabo, whose chapter consecrated to the glory of the gourd\nas a symbol of fruitfulness, enlivened him; with the poem in which\nErmold the Dark, celebrating the exploits of Louis the Debonair, a\npoem written in regular hexameters, in an austere, almost forbidding\nstyle and in a Latin of iron dipped in monastic waters with straws of\nsentiment, here and there, in the unpliant metal; with the _De viribus\nherbarum_, the poem of Macer Floridus, who particularly delighted him\nbecause of his poetic recipes and the very strange virtues which he\nascribes to certain plants and flowers; to the aristolochia, for\nexample, which, mixed with the flesh of a cow and placed on the lower\npart of a pregnant woman's abdomen, insures the birth of a male child;\nor to the borage which, when brewed into an infusion in a dining room,\ndiverts guests; or to the peony whose powdered roots cure epilepsy; or\nto the fennel which, if placed on a woman's breasts, clears her water\nand stimulates the indolence of her periods.\n\nApart from several special, unclassified volumes, modern or dateless,\ncertain works on the Cabbala, medicine and botany, certain odd tomes\ncontaining undiscoverable Christian poetry, and the anthology of the\nminor Latin poets of Wernsdorf; apart from _Meursius_, the manual of\nclassical erotology of Forberg, and the diaconals used by confessors,\nwhich he dusted at rare intervals, his Latin library ended at the\nbeginning of the tenth century.\n\nAnd, in fact, the curiosity, the complicated naivete of the Christian\nlanguage had also foundered. The balderdash of philosophers and\nscholars, the logomachy of the Middle Ages, thenceforth held absolute\nsway. The sooty mass of chronicles and historical books and\ncartularies accumulated, and the stammering grace, the often exquisite\nawkwardness of the monks, placing the poetic remains of antiquity in a\nragout, were dead. The fabrications of verbs and purified essences, of\nsubstantives breathing of incense, of bizarre adjectives, coarsely\ncarved from gold, with the barbarous and charming taste of Gothic\njewels, were destroyed. The old editions, beloved by Des Esseintes,\nhere ended; and with a formidable leap of centuries, the books on his\nshelves went straight to the French language of the present century.\n\n\n\n\n    Chapter 5\n\n\nThe afternoon was drawing to its close when a carriage halted in front\nof the Fontenay house. Since Des Esseintes received no visitors, and\nsince the postman never even ventured into these uninhabited parts,\nhaving no occasion to deliver any papers, magazines or letters, the\nservants hesitated before opening the door. Then, as the bell was rung\nfuriously again, they peered through the peep-hole cut into the wall,\nand perceived a man, concealed, from neck to waist, behind an immense\ngold buckler.\n\nThey informed their master, who was breakfasting.\n\n\"Ask him in,\" he said, for he recalled having given his address to a\nlapidary for the delivery of a purchase.\n\nThe man bowed and deposited the buckler on the pinewood floor of the\ndining room. It oscillated and wavered, revealing the serpentine head\nof a tortoise which, suddenly terrified, retreated into its shell.\n\nThis tortoise was a fancy which had seized Des Esseintes some time\nbefore his departure from Paris. Examining an Oriental rug, one day,\nin reflected light, and following the silver gleams which fell on its\nweb of plum violet and alladin yellow, it suddenly occurred to him how\nmuch it would be improved if he could place on it some object whose\ndeep color might enhance the vividness of its tints.\n\nPossessed by this idea, he had been strolling aimlessly along the\nstreets, when suddenly he found himself gazing at the very object of\nhis wishes. There, in a shop window on the Palais Royal, lay a huge\ntortoise in a large basin. He had purchased it. Then he had sat a long\ntime, with eyes half-shut, studying the effect.\n\nDecidedly, the Ethiopic black, the harsh Sienna tone of this shell\ndulled the rug's reflections without adding to it. The dominant silver\ngleams in it barely sparkled, crawling with lack-lustre tones of dead\nzinc against the edges of the hard, tarnished shell.\n\nHe bit his nails while he studied a method of removing these discords\nand reconciling the determined opposition of the tones. He finally\ndiscovered that his first inspiration, which was to animate the fire\nof the weave by setting it off against some dark object, was\nerroneous. In fact, this rug was too new, too petulant and gaudy. The\ncolors were not sufficiently subdued. He must reverse the process,\ndull the tones, and extinguish them by the contrast of a striking\nobject, which would eclipse all else and cast a golden light on the\npale silver. Thus stated, the problem was easier to solve. He\ntherefore decided to glaze the shell of the tortoise with gold.\n\nThe tortoise, just returned by the lapidary, shone brilliantly,\nsoftening the tones of the rug and casting on it a gorgeous reflection\nwhich resembled the irradiations from the scales of a barbaric\nVisigoth shield.\n\nAt first Des Esseintes was enchanted with this effect. Then he\nreflected that this gigantic jewel was only in outline, that it would\nnot really be complete until it had been incrusted with rare stones.\n\nFrom a Japanese collection he chose a design representing a cluster of\nflowers emanating spindle-like, from a slender stalk. Taking it to a\njeweler, he sketched a border to enclose this bouquet in an oval\nframe, and informed the amazed lapidary that every petal and every\nleaf was to be designed with jewels and mounted on the scales of the\ntortoise.\n\nThe choice of stones made him pause. The diamond has become\nnotoriously common since every tradesman has taken to wearing it on\nhis little finger. The oriental emeralds and rubies are less\nvulgarized and cast brilliant, rutilant flames, but they remind one of\nthe green and red antennae of certain omnibuses which carry signal\nlights of these colors. As for topazes, whether sparkling or dim, they\nare cheap stones, precious only to women of the middle class who like\nto have jewel cases on their dressing-tables. And then, although the\nChurch has preserved for the amethyst a sacerdotal character which is\nat once unctuous and solemn, this stone, too, is abused on the\nblood-red ears and veined hands of butchers' wives who love to adorn\nthemselves inexpensively with real and heavy jewels. Only the\nsapphire, among all these stones, has kept its fires undefiled by any\ntaint of commercialism. Its sparks, crackling in its limpid, cold\ndepths have in some way protected its shy and proud nobility from\npollution. Unfortunately, its fresh fire does not sparkle in\nartificial light: the blue retreats and seems to fall asleep, only\nawakening to shine at daybreak.\n\nNone of these satisfied Des Esseintes at all. They were too civilized\nand familiar. He let trickle through his fingers still more\nastonishing and bizarre stones, and finally selected a number of real\nand artificial ones which, used together, should produce a fascinating\nand disconcerting harmony.\n\nThis is how he composed his bouquet of flowers: the leaves were set\nwith jewels of a pronounced, distinct green; the chrysoberyls of\nasparagus green; the chrysolites of leek green; the olivines of olive\ngreen. They hung from branches of almandine and _ouwarovite_ of a\nviolet red, darting spangles of a hard brilliance like tartar micas\ngleaming through forest depths.\n\nFor the flowers, separated from the stalk and removed from the bottom\nof the sheaf, he used blue cinder. But he formally waived that\noriental turquoise used for brooches and rings which, like the banal\npearl and the odious coral, serves to delight people of no importance.\nHe chose occidental turquoises exclusively, stones which, properly\nspeaking, are only a fossil ivory impregnated with coppery substances\nwhose sea blue is choked, opaque, sulphurous, as though yellowed by\nbile.\n\nThis done, he could now set the petals of his flowers with transparent\nstones which had morbid and vitreous sparks, feverish and sharp\nlights.\n\nHe composed them entirely with Ceylon snap-dragons, cymophanes and\nblue chalcedony.\n\nThese three stones darted mysterious and perverse scintillations,\npainfully torn from the frozen depths of their troubled waters.\n\nThe snap-dragon of a greenish grey, streaked with concentric veins\nwhich seem to stir and change constantly, according to the\ndispositions of light.\n\nThe cymophane, whose azure waves float over the milky tint swimming in\nits depths.\n\nThe blue chalcedony which kindles with bluish phosphorescent fires\nagainst a dead brown, chocolate background.\n\nThe lapidary made a note of the places where the stones were to be\ninlaid. \"And the border of the shell?\" he asked Des Esseintes.\n\nAt first he had thought of some opals and hydrophanes; but these\nstones, interesting for their hesitating colors, for the evasions of\ntheir flames, are too refractory and faithless; the opal has a quite\nrheumatic sensitiveness; the play of its rays alters according to the\nhumidity, the warmth or cold; as for the hydrophane, it only burns in\nwater and only consents to kindle its embers when moistened.\n\nHe finally decided on minerals whose reflections vary; for the\nCompostelle hyacinth, mahogany red; the beryl, glaucous green; the\nbalas ruby, vinegar rose; the Sudermanian ruby, pale slate. Their\nfeeble sparklings sufficed to light the darkness of the shell and\npreserved the values of the flowering stones which they encircled with\na slender garland of vague fires.\n\nDes Esseintes now watched the tortoise squatting in a corner of the\ndining room, shining in the shadow.\n\nHe was perfectly happy. His eyes gleamed with pleasure at the\nresplendencies of the flaming corrollae against the gold background.\nThen, he grew hungry--a thing that rarely if ever happened to him--and\ndipped his toast, spread with a special butter, in a cup of tea, a\nflawless blend of Siafayoune, Moyoutann and Khansky--yellow teas which\nhad come from China to Russia by special caravans.\n\nThis liquid perfume he drank in those Chinese porcelains called\negg-shell, so light and diaphanous they are. And, as an accompaniment\nto these adorable cups, he used a service of solid silver, slightly\ngilded; the silver showed faintly under the fatigued layer of gold,\nwhich gave it an aged, quite exhausted and moribund tint.\n\nAfter he had finished his tea, he returned to his study and had the\nservant carry in the tortoise which stubbornly refused to budge.\n\nThe snow was falling. By the lamp light, he saw the icy patterns on\nthe bluish windows, and the hoar-frost, like melted sugar,\nscintillating in the stumps of bottles spotted with gold.\n\nA deep silence enveloped the cottage drooping in shadow.\n\nDes Esseintes fell into revery. The fireplace piled with logs gave\nforth a smell of burning wood. He opened the window slightly.\n\nLike a high tapestry of black ermine, the sky rose before him, black\nflecked with white.\n\nAn icy wind swept past, accelerated the crazy flight of the snow, and\nreversed the color order.\n\nThe heraldic tapestry of heaven returned, became a true ermine, a\nwhite flecked with black, in its turn, by the specks of darkness\ndispersed among the flakes.\n\nHe closed the window. This abrupt transition from torrid warmth to\ncold winter affected him. He crouched near the fire and it occurred to\nhim that he needed a cordial to revive his flagging spirits.\n\nHe went to the dining room where, built in one of the panels, was a\ncloset containing a number of tiny casks, ranged side by side, and\nresting on small stands of sandal wood.\n\nThis collection of barrels he called his mouth organ.\n\nA stem could connect all the spigots and control them by a single\nmovement, so that once attached, he had only to press a button\nconcealed in the woodwork to turn on all the taps at the same time and\nfill the mugs placed underneath.\n\nThe organ was now open. The stops labelled flute, horn, celestial\nvoice, were pulled out, ready to be placed. Des Esseintes sipped here\nand there, enjoying the inner symphonies, succeeded in procuring\nsensations in his throat analogous to those which music gives to the\near.\n\nMoreover, each liquor corresponded, according to his thinking, to the\nsound of some instrument. Dry curacoa, for example, to the clarinet\nwhose tone is sourish and velvety; _kummel_ to the oboe whose sonorous\nnotes snuffle; mint and anisette to the flute, at once sugary and\npeppery, puling and sweet; while, to complete the orchestra,\n_kirschwasser_ has the furious ring of the trumpet; gin and whiskey\nburn the palate with their strident crashings of trombones and\ncornets; brandy storms with the deafening hubbub of tubas; while the\nthunder-claps of the cymbals and the furiously beaten drum roll in the\nmouth by means of the _rakis de Chio_.\n\nHe also thought that the comparison could be continued, that quartets\nof string instruments could play under the palate, with the violin\nsimulated by old brandy, fumous and fine, piercing and frail; the\ntenor violin by rum, louder and more sonorous; the cello by the\nlacerating and lingering ratafia, melancholy and caressing; with the\ndouble-bass, full-bodied, solid and dark as the old bitters. If one\nwished to form a quintet, one could even add a fifth instrument with\nthe vibrant taste, the silvery detached and shrill note of dry cumin\nimitating the harp.\n\nThe comparison was further prolonged. Tone relationships existed in\nthe music of liquors; to cite but one note, benedictine represents, so\nto speak, the minor key of that major key of alcohols which are\ndesignated in commercial scores, under the name of green Chartreuse.\n\nThese principles once admitted, he succeeded, after numerous\nexperiments, in enjoying silent melodies on his tongue, mute funeral\nmarches, in hearing, in his mouth, solos of mint, duos of ratafia and\nrum.\n\nHe was even able to transfer to his palate real pieces of music,\nfollowing the composer step by step, rendering his thought, his\neffects, his nuances, by combinations or contrasts of liquors, by\napproximative and skilled mixtures.\n\nAt other times, he himself composed melodies, executed pastorals with\nmild black-currant which evoked, in his throat, the trillings of\nnightingales; with the tender chouva cocoa which sang saccharine songs\nlike \"The romance of Estelle\" and the \"Ah! Shall I tell you, mama,\" of\npast days.\n\nBut on this evening Des Esseintes was not inclined to listen to this\nmusic. He confined himself to sounding one note on the keyboard of his\norgan, by swallowing a little glass of genuine Irish whiskey.\n\nHe sank into his easy chair and slowly inhaled this fermented juice of\noats and barley: a pronounced taste of creosote was in his mouth.\n\nGradually, as he drank, his thought followed the now revived\nsensitiveness of his palate, fitted its progress to the flavor of the\nwhiskey, re-awakened, by a fatal exactitude of odors, memories effaced\nfor years.\n\nThis carbolic tartness forcibly recalled to him the same taste he had\nhad on his tongue in the days when dentists worked on his gums.\n\nOnce abandoned on this track, his revery, at first dispersed among all\nthe dentists he had known, concentrated and converged on one of them\nwho was more firmly engraved in his memory.\n\nIt had happened three years ago. Seized, in the middle of the night,\nwith an abominable toothache, he put his hand to his cheek, stumbled\nagainst the furniture, pacing up and down the room like a demented\nperson.\n\nIt was a molar which had already been filled; no remedy was possible.\nOnly a dentist could alleviate the pain. He feverishly waited for the\nday, resolved to bear the most atrocious operation provided it would\nonly ease his sufferings.\n\nHolding a hand to his jaw, he asked himself what should be done. The\ndentists who treated him were rich merchants whom one could not see at\nany time; one had to make an appointment. He told himself that this\nwould never do, that he could not endure it. He decided to patronize\nthe first one he could find, to hasten to a popular tooth-extractor,\none of those iron-fisted men who, if they are ignorant of the useless\nart of dressing decaying teeth and of filling holes, know how to pull\nthe stubbornest stump with an unequalled rapidity. There, the office\nis opened early in the morning and one is not required to wait. Seven\no'clock struck at last. He hurried out, and recollecting the name of a\nmechanic who called himself a dentist and dwelt in the corner of a\nquay, he rushed through the streets, holding his cheek with his hands\nrepressing the tears.\n\nArrived in front of the house, recognizable by an immense wooden\nsignboard where the name of \"Gatonax\" sprawled in enormous\npumpkin-colored letters, and by two little glass cases where false\nteeth were carefully set in rose-colored wax, he gasped for breath. He\nperspired profusely. A horrible fear shook him, a trembling crept\nunder his skin; suddenly a calm ensued, the suffering ceased, the\ntooth stopped paining.\n\nHe remained, stupefied, on the sidewalk; finally, he stiffened against\nthe anguish, mounted the dim stairway, running up four steps at a time\nto the fourth story. He found himself in front of a door where an\nenamel plate repeated, inscribed in sky-blue lettering, the name on\nthe signboard. He rang the bell and then, terrified by the great red\nspittles which he noticed on the steps, he faced about, resolved to\nendure his toothache all his life. At that moment an excruciating cry\npierced the partitions, filled the cage of the doorway and glued him\nto the spot with horror, at the same time that a door was opened and\nan old woman invited him to enter.\n\nHis feeling of shame quickly changed to fear. He was ushered into a\ndining room. Another door creaked and in entered a terrible grenadier\ndressed in a frock-coat and black trousers. Des Esseintes followed him\nto another room.\n\nFrom this instant, his sensations were confused. He vaguely remembered\nhaving sunk into a chair opposite a window, having murmured, as he put\na finger to his tooth: \"It has already been filled and I am afraid\nnothing more can be done with it.\"\n\nThe man immediately suppressed these explanations by introducing an\nenormous index finger into his mouth. Muttering beneath his waxed\nfang-like moustaches, he took an instrument from the table.\n\nThen the play began. Clinging to the arms of his seat, Des Esseintes\nfelt a cold sensation in his cheek, and began to suffer unheard\nagonies. Then he beheld stars. He stamped his feet frantically and\nbleated like a sheep about to be slaughtered.\n\nA snapping sound was heard, the molar had broken while being\nextracted. It seemed that his head was being shattered, that his skull\nwas being smashed; he lost his senses, howled as loudly as he could,\nfuriously defending himself from the man who rushed at him anew as if\nhe wished to implant his whole arm in the depths of his bowels,\nbrusquely recoiled a step and, lifting the tooth attached to the jaw,\nbrutally let him fall back into the chair. Breathing heavily, his form\nfilling the window, he brandished at one end of his forceps, a blue\ntooth with blood at one end.\n\nFaint and prostrate, Des Esseintes spat blood into a basin, refused\nwith a gesture, the tooth which the old woman was about to wrap in a\npiece of paper and fled, after paying two francs. Expectorating blood,\nin his turn, down the steps, he at length found himself in the street,\njoyous, feeling ten years younger, interested in every little\noccurrence.\n\n\"Phew!\" he exclaimed, saddened by the assault of these memories. He\nrose to dissipate the horrible spell of this vision and, returning to\nreality, began to be concerned with the tortoise.\n\nIt did not budge at all and he tapped it. The animal was dead.\nDoubtless accustomed to a sedentary existence, to a humble life spent\nunderneath its poor shell, it had been unable to support the dazzling\nluxury imposed on it, the rutilant cope with which it had been\ncovered, the jewels with which its back had been paved, like a pyx.\n\n\n\n\n    Chapter 6\n\n\nWith the sharpening of his desire to withdraw from a hated age, he\nfelt a despotic urge to shun pictures representing humanity striving\nin little holes or running to and fro in quest of money.\n\nWith his growing indifference to contemporary life he had resolved not\nto introduce into his cell any of the ghosts of distastes or regrets,\nbut had desired to procure subtle and exquisite paintings, steeped in\nancient dreams or antique corruptions, far removed from the manner of\nour present day.\n\nFor the delight of his spirit and the joy of his eyes, he had desired\na few suggestive creations that cast him into an unknown world,\nrevealing to him the contours of new conjectures, agitating the\nnervous system by the violent deliriums, complicated nightmares,\nnonchalant or atrocious chimerae they induced.\n\nAmong these were some executed by an artist whose genius allured and\nentranced him: Gustave Moreau.\n\nDes Esseintes had acquired his two masterpieces and, at night, used to\nsink into revery before one of them--a representation of Salome,\nconceived in this fashion:\n\nA throne, resembling the high altar of a cathedral, reared itself\nbeneath innumerable vaults leaping from heavy Romanesque pillars,\nstudded with polychromatic bricks, set with mosaics, incrusted with\nlapis lazuli and sardonyx, in a palace that, like a basilica, was at\nonce Mohammedan and Byzantine in design.\n\nIn the center of the tabernacle, surmounting an altar approached by\nsemi-circular steps, sat Herod the Tetrarch, a tiara upon his head,\nhis legs pressed closely together, his hands resting upon his knees.\n\nHis face was the color of yellow parchment; it was furrowed with\nwrinkles, ravaged with age. His long beard floated like a white cloud\nupon the star-like clusters of jewels constellating the orphrey robe\nfitting tightly over his breast.\n\nAround this form, frozen into the immobile, sacerdotal, hieratic pose\nof a Hindoo god, burned perfumes wafting aloft clouds of incense which\nwere perforated, like phosphorescent eyes of beasts, by the fiery rays\nof the stones set in the throne. Then the vapor rolled up, diffusing\nitself beneath arcades where the blue smoke mingled with the gold\npowder of the long sunbeams falling from the domes.\n\nIn the perverse odor of the perfumes, in the overheated atmosphere of\nthe temple, Salome, her left arm outstretched in a gesture of command,\nher right arm drawn back and holding a large lotus on a level with her\nface, slowly advances on her toes, to the rhythm of a stringed\ninstrument played by a woman seated on the ground.\n\nHer face is meditative, solemn, almost august, as she commences the\nlascivious dance that will awaken the slumbering senses of old Herod.\nDiamonds scintillate against her glistening skin. Her bracelets, her\ngirdles, her rings flash. On her triumphal robe, seamed with pearls,\nflowered with silver and laminated with gold, the breastplate of\njewels, each link of which is a precious stone, flashes serpents of\nfire against the pallid flesh, delicate as a tea-rose: its jewels like\nsplendid insects with dazzling elytra, veined with carmine, dotted\nwith yellow gold, diapered with blue steel, speckled with peacock\ngreen.\n\nWith a tense concentration, with the fixed gaze of a somnambulist, she\nbeholds neither the trembling Tetrarch, nor her mother, the fierce\nHerodias who watches her, nor the hermaphrodite, nor the eunuch who\nsits, sword in hand, at the foot of the throne--a terrible figure,\nveiled to his eyes, whose breasts droop like gourds under his\norange-checkered tunic.\n\nThis conception of Salome, so haunting to artists and poets, had\nobsessed Des Esseintes for years. How often had he read in the old\nBible of Pierre Variquet, translated by the theological doctors of the\nUniversity of Louvain, the Gospel of Saint Matthew who, in brief and\ningenuous phrases, recounts the beheading of the Baptist! How often\nhad he fallen into revery, as he read these lines:\n\n    But when Herod's birthday was kept, the\n    daughter of Herodias danced before them, and\n    pleased Herod.\n\n    Whereupon he promised with an oath to give\n    her whatsoever she would ask.\n\n    And she, being before instructed of her\n    mother, said: Give me here John Baptist's\n    head in a charger.\n\n    And the king was sorry: nevertheless, for\n    the oath's sake, and them which sat with him\n    at meat, he commanded it to be given her.\n\n    And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison.\n\n    And his head was brought in a charger, and\n    given to the damsel: and she brought it to\n    her mother.\n\nBut neither Saint Matthew, nor Saint Mark, nor Saint Luke, nor the\nother Evangelists had emphasized the maddening charms and depravities\nof the dancer. She remained vague and hidden, mysterious and swooning\nin the far-off mist of the centuries, not to be grasped by vulgar and\nmaterialistic minds, accessible only to disordered and volcanic\nintellects made visionaries by their neuroticism; rebellious to\npainters of the flesh, to Rubens who disguised her as a butcher's wife\nof Flanders; a mystery to all the writers who had never succeeded in\nportraying the disquieting exaltation of this dancer, the refined\ngrandeur of this murderess.\n\nIn Gustave Moreau's work, conceived independently of the Testament\nthemes, Des Esseintes as last saw realized the superhuman and exotic\nSalome of his dreams. She was no longer the mere performer who wrests\na cry of desire and of passion from an old man by a perverted twisting\nof her loins; who destroys the energy and breaks the will of a king by\ntrembling breasts and quivering belly. She became, in a sense, the\nsymbolic deity of indestructible lust, the goddess of immortal\nHysteria, of accursed Beauty, distinguished from all others by the\ncatalepsy which stiffens her flesh and hardens her muscles; the\nmonstrous Beast, indifferent, irresponsible, insensible, baneful, like\nthe Helen of antiquity, fatal to all who approach her, all who behold\nher, all whom she touches.\n\nThus understood, she was associated with the theogonies of the Far\nEast. She no longer sprang from biblical traditions, could no longer\neven be assimilated with the living image of Babylon, the royal\nProstitute of the Apocalypse, garbed like her in jewels and purple,\nand painted like her; for she was not hurled by a fatidical power, by\na supreme force, into the alluring vileness of debauchery.\n\nThe painter, moreover, seems to have wished to affirm his desire of\nremaining outside the centuries, scorning to designate the origin,\nnation and epoch, by placing his Salome in this extraordinary palace\nwith its confused and imposing style, in clothing her with sumptuous\nand chimerical robes, in crowning her with a fantastic mitre shaped\nlike a Phoenician tower, such as Salammbo bore, and placing in her\nhand the sceptre of Isis, the tall lotus, sacred flower of Egypt and\nIndia.\n\nDes Esseintes sought the sense of this emblem. Had it that phallic\nsignificance which the primitive cults of India gave it? Did it\nenunciate an oblation of virginity to the senile Herod, an exchange of\nblood, an impure and voluntary wound, offered under the express\nstipulation of a monstrous sin? Or did it represent the allegory of\nfecundity, the Hindoo myth of life, an existence held between the\nhands of woman, distorted and trampled by the palpitant hands of man\nwhom a fit of madness seizes, seduced by a convulsion of the flesh?\n\nPerhaps, too, in arming his enigmatic goddess with the venerated\nlotus, the painter had dreamed of the dancer, the mortal woman with\nthe polluted Vase, from whom spring all sins and crimes. Perhaps he\nhad recalled the rites of ancient Egypt, the sepulchral ceremonies of\nthe embalming when, after stretching the corpse on a bench of jasper,\nextracting the brain with curved needles through the chambers of the\nnose, the chemists and the priests, before gilding the nails and teeth\nand coating the body with bitumens and essences, inserted the chaste\npetals of the divine flower in the sexual parts, to purify them.\n\nHowever this may be, an irresistible fascination emanated from this\npainting; but the water-color entitled _The Apparition_ was perhaps\neven more disturbing.\n\nThere, the palace of Herod arose like an Alhambra on slender,\niridescent columns with moorish tile, joined with silver beton and\ngold cement. Arabesques proceeded from lozenges of lapis lazuli, wove\ntheir patterns on the cupolas where, on nacreous marquetry, crept\nrainbow gleams and prismatic flames.\n\nThe murder was accomplished. The executioner stood impassive, his\nhands on the hilt of his long, blood-stained sword.\n\nThe severed head of the saint stared lividly on the charger resting on\nthe slabs; the mouth was discolored and open, the neck crimson, and\ntears fell from the eyes. The face was encircled by an aureole worked\nin mosaic, which shot rays of light under the porticos and illuminated\nthe horrible ascension of the head, brightening the glassy orbs of the\ncontracted eyes which were fixed with a ghastly stare upon the dancer.\n\nWith a gesture of terror, Salome thrusts from her the horrible vision\nwhich transfixes her, motionless, to the ground. Her eyes dilate, her\nhands clasp her neck in a convulsive clutch.\n\nShe is almost nude. In the ardor of the dance, her veils had become\nloosened. She is garbed only in gold-wrought stuffs and limpid stones;\na neck-piece clasps her as a corselet does the body and, like a superb\nbuckle, a marvelous jewel sparkles on the hollow between her breasts.\nA girdle encircles her hips, concealing the upper part of her thighs,\nagainst which beats a gigantic pendant streaming with carbuncles and\nemeralds.\n\nAll the facets of the jewels kindle under the ardent shafts of light\nescaping from the head of the Baptist. The stones grow warm, outlining\nthe woman's body with incandescent rays, striking her neck, feet and\narms with tongues of fire,--vermilions like coals, violets like jets\nof gas, blues like flames of alcohol, and whites like star light.\n\nThe horrible head blazes, bleeding constantly, clots of sombre purple\non the ends of the beard and hair. Visible for Salome alone, it does\nnot, with its fixed gaze, attract Herodias, musing on her finally\nconsummated revenge, nor the Tetrarch who, bent slightly forward, his\nhands on his knees, still pants, maddened by the nudity of the woman\nsaturated with animal odors, steeped in balms, exuding incense and\nmyrrh.\n\nLike the old king, Des Esseintes remained dumbfounded, overwhelmed and\nseized with giddiness, in the presence of this dancer who was less\nmajestic, less haughty but more disquieting than the Salome of the oil\npainting.\n\nIn this insensate and pitiless image, in this innocent and dangerous\nidol, the eroticism and terror of mankind were depicted. The tall\nlotus had disappeared, the goddess had vanished; a frightful nightmare\nnow stifled the woman, dizzied by the whirlwind of the dance,\nhypnotized and petrified by terror.\n\nIt was here that she was indeed Woman, for here she gave rein to her\nardent and cruel temperament. She was living, more refined and savage,\nmore execrable and exquisite. She more energetically awakened the\ndulled senses of man, more surely bewitched and subdued his power of\nwill, with the charm of a tall venereal flower, cultivated in\nsacrilegious beds, in impious hothouses.\n\nDes Esseintes thought that never before had a water color attained\nsuch magnificent coloring; never before had the poverty of colors been\nable to force jeweled corruscations from paper, gleams like stained\nglass windows touched by rays of sunlight, splendors of tissue and\nflesh so fabulous and dazzling. Lost in contemplation, he sought to\ndiscover the origins of this great artist and mystic pagan, this\nvisionary who succeeded in removing himself from the world\nsufficiently to behold, here in Paris, the splendor of these cruel\nvisions and the enchanting sublimation of past ages.\n\nDes Esseintes could not trace the genesis of this artist. Here and\nthere were vague suggestions of Mantegna and of Jacopo de Barbari;\nhere and there were confused hints of Vinci and of the feverish colors\nof Delacroix. But the influences of such masters remained negligible.\nThe fact was that Gustave Moreau derived from no one else. He remained\nunique in contemporary art, without ancestors and without possible\ndescendants. He went to ethnographic sources, to the origins of myths,\nand he compared and elucidated their intricate enigmas. He reunited\nthe legends of the Far East into a whole, the myths which had been\naltered by the superstitions of other peoples; thus justifying his\narchitectonic fusions, his luxurious and outlandish fabrics, his\nhieratic and sinister allegories sharpened by the restless perceptions\nof a pruriently modern neurosis. And he remained saddened, haunted by\nthe symbols of perversities and superhuman loves, of divine\nstuprations brought to end without abandonment and without hope.\n\nHis depressing and erudite productions possessed a strange\nenchantment, an incantation that stirred one to the depths, just as do\ncertain poems of Baudelaire, caused one to pause disconcerted, amazed,\nbrooding on the spell of an art which leaped beyond the confines of\npainting, borrowing its most subtle effects from the art of writing,\nits most marvelous stokes from the art of Limosin, its most exquisite\nrefinements from the art of the lapidary and the engraver. These two\npictures of Salome, for which Des Esseintes' admiration was boundless,\nhe had hung on the walls of his study on special panels between the\nbookshelves, so that they might live under his eyes.\n\nBut these were not the only pictures he had acquired to divert his\nsolitude.\n\nAlthough he had surrendered to his servants the second story of his\nhouse, which he himself never used at all, the ground floor had\nrequired a number of pictures to fit the walls.\n\nIt was thus arranged:\n\nA dressing room, communicating with the bedroom, occupied one of the\ncorners of the house. One passed from the bedroom to the library, and\nfrom the library into the dining room, which formed the other corner.\n\nThese rooms, whose windows looked out on the Aunay Valley, composed\none of the sides of the dwelling.\n\nThe other side of the house had four rooms arranged in the same order.\nThus, the kitchen formed an angle, and corresponded with the dining\nroom; a long corridor, which served as the entrance, with the library;\na small dressing room, with the bedroom; and the toilet, forming a\nsecond angle, with the dressing room.\n\nThese rooms received the light from the side opposite the Aunay Valley\nand faced the Towers of Croy and Chatillon.\n\nAs for the staircase, it was built outside, against one of the sides\nof the house, and the footsteps of his servants in ascending or\ndescending thus reached Des Esseintes less distinctly.\n\nThe dressing room was tapestried in deep red. On the walls, in ebony\nframes, hung the prints of Jan Luyken, an old Dutch engraver almost\nunknown in France.\n\nHe possessed of the work of this artist, who was fantastic and\nmelancholy, vehement and wild, the series of his _Religious\nPersecutions_, horrible prints depicting all the agonies invented by\nthe madness of religions: prints pregnant with human sufferings,\nshowing bodies roasting on fires, skulls slit open with swords,\ntrepaned with nails and gashed with saws, intestines separated from\nthe abdomen and twisted on spools, finger nails slowly extracted with\npincers, eyes gouged, limbs dislocated and deliberately broken, and\nbones bared of flesh and agonizingly scraped by sheets of metal.\n\nThese works filled with abominable imaginings, offensive with their\nodors of burning, oozing with blood and clamorous with cries of horror\nand maledictions, gave Des Esseintes, who was held fascinated in this\nred room, the creeping sensations of goose-flesh.\n\nBut in addition to the tremblings they occasioned, beyond the terrible\nskill of this man, the extraordinary life which animates his\ncharacters, one discovered, among his astonishing, swarming\nthrongs--among his mobs of people delineated with a dexterity which\nrecalled Callot, but which had a strength never possessed by that\namusing dauber--curious reconstructions of bygone ages. The\narchitecture, costumes and customs during the time of the Maccabeans,\nof Rome under the Christian persecutions, of Spain under the\nInquisition, of France during the Middle Ages, at the time of Saint\nBartholomew and the Dragonnades, were studied with a meticulous care\nand noted with scientific accuracy.\n\nThese prints were veritable treasures of learning. One could gaze at\nthem for hours without experiencing any sense of weariness. Profoundly\nsuggestive in reflections, they assisted Des Esseintes in passing many\na day when his books failed to charm him.\n\nLuyken's life, too, fascinated him, by explaining the hallucination of\nhis work. A fervent Calvinist, a stubborn sectarian, unbalanced by\nprayers and hymns, he wrote religious poetry which he illustrated,\nparaphrased the psalms in verse, lost himself in the reading of the\nBible from which he emerged haggard and frenzied, his brain haunted by\nmonstrous subjects, his mouth twisted by the maledictions of the\nReformation and by its songs of terror and hate.\n\nAnd he scorned the world, surrendering his wealth to the poor and\nsubsisting on a slice of bread. He ended his life in travelling, with\nan equally fanatical servant, going where chance led his boat,\npreaching the Gospel far and wide, endeavoring to forego nourishment,\nand eventually becoming almost demented and violent.\n\nOther bizarre sketches were hung in the larger, adjoining room, as\nwell as in the corridor, both of which had woodwork of red cedar.\n\nThere was Bresdin's _Comedy of Death_ in which, in the fantastic\nlandscape bristling with trees, brushwood and tufts of grass\nresembling phantom, demon forms, teeming with rat-headed, pod-tailed\nbirds, on earth covered with ribs, skulls and bones, gnarled and\ncracked willows rear their trunks, surmounted by agitated skeletons\nwhose arms beat the air while they intone a song of victory. A Christ\nspeeds across a clouded sky; a hermit in the depths of a cave\nmeditates, holding his head in his hands; one wretch dies, exhausted\nby long privation and enfeebled by hunger, lying on his back, his legs\noutstretched in front of a pond.\n\nThe _Good Samaritan_, by the same artist, is a large engraving on\nstone: an incongruous medley of palms, sorbs and oaks grown together,\nheedless of seasons and climates, peopled with monkeys and owls,\ncovered with old stumps as misshapen as the roots of the mandrake;\nthen a magical forest, cut in the center near a glade through which a\nstream can be seen far away, behind a camel and the Samaritan group;\nthen an elfin town appearing on the horizon of an exotic sky dotted\nwith birds and covered with masses of fleecy clouds.\n\nIt could be called the design of an uncertain, primitive Durer with an\nopium-steeped brain. But although he liked the finesse of the detail\nand the imposing appearance of this print, Des Esseintes had a special\nweakness for the other frames adorning the room.\n\nThey were signed: Odilon Redon.\n\nThey enclosed inconceivable apparitions in their rough, gold-striped\npear-tree wood. A head of a Merovingian style, resting against a bowl,\na bearded man, at once resembling a Buddhist priest and an orator at a\npublic reunion, touching the ball of a gigantic cannon with his\nfingers; a frightful spider revealing a human face in its body. The\ncharcoal drawings went even farther into dream terrors. Here, an\nenormous die in which a sad eye winked; there, dry and arid\nlandscapes, dusty plains, shifting ground, volcanic upheavals catching\nrebellious clouds, stagnant and livid skies. Sometimes the subjects\neven seemed to have borrowed from the cacodemons of science, reverting\nto prehistoric times. A monstrous plant on the rocks, queer blocks\neverywhere, glacial mud, figures whose simian shapes, heavy jaws,\nbeetling eyebrows, retreating foreheads and flat skulls, recalled the\nancestral heads of the first quaternary periods, when inarticulate man\nstill devoured fruits and seeds, and was still contemporaneous with\nthe mammoth, the rhinoceros and the big bear. These designs were\nbeyond anything imaginable; they leaped, for the most part, beyond the\nlimits of painting and introduced a fantasy that was unique, the\nfantasy of a diseased and delirious mind.\n\nAnd, indeed, certain of these faces, with their monstrous, insane\neyes, certain of these swollen, deformed bodies resembling carafes,\ninduced in Des Esseintes recollections of typhoid, memories of\nfeverish nights and of the shocking visions of his infancy which\npersisted and would not be suppressed.\n\nSeized with an indefinable uneasiness in the presence of these\nsketches, the same sensation caused by certain _Proverbs_ of Goya\nwhich they recalled, or by the reading of Edgar Allen Poe's tales,\nwhose mirages of hallucination and effects of fear Odilon Redon seemed\nto have transposed to a different art, he rubbed his eyes and turned\nto contemplate a radiant figure which, amid these tormenting sketches,\narose serene and calm--a figure of Melancholy seated near the disk of\na sun, on the rocks, in a dejected and gloomy posture.\n\nThe shadows were dispersed as though by an enchantment. A charming\nsadness, a languid and desolate feeling flowed through him. He\nmeditated long before this work which, with its dashes of paint\nflecking the thick crayon, spread a brilliance of sea-green and of\npale gold among the protracted darkness of the charcoal prints.\n\nIn addition to this series of the works of Redon which adorned nearly\nevery panel of the passage, he had hung a disturbing sketch by El\nGreco in his bedroom. It was a Christ done in strange tints, in a\nstrained design, possessing a wild color and a disordered energy: a\npicture executed in the painter's second manner when he had been\ntormented by the necessity of avoiding imitation of Titian.\n\nThis sinister painting, with its wax and sickly green tones, bore an\naffinity to certain ideas Des Esseintes had with regard to furnishing\na room.\n\nAccording to him, there were but two ways of fitting a bedroom. One\ncould either make it a sense-stimulating alcove, a place for nocturnal\ndelights, or a cell for solitude and repose, a retreat for thought, a\nsort of oratory.\n\nFor the first instance, the Louis XV style was inevitable for the\nfastidious, for the cerebrally morbid. Only the eighteenth century had\nsucceeded in enveloping woman with a vicious atmosphere, imitating her\ncontours in the undulations and twistings of wood and copper,\naccentuating the sugary languor of the blond with its clear and lively\n_decors_, attenuating the pungency of the brunette with its tapestries\nof aqueous, sweet, almost insipid tones.\n\nHe had once had such a room in Paris, with a lofty, white, lacquered\nbed which is one stimulant the more, a source of depravity to old\nroues, leering at the false chastity and hypocritical modesty of\nGreuze's tender virgins, at the deceptive candor of a bed evocative of\nbabes and chaste maidens.\n\nFor the second instance,--and now that he wished to put behind him the\nirritating memories of his past life, this was the only possible\nexpedient--he was compelled to design a room that would be like a\nmonastic cell. But difficulties faced him here, for he refused to\naccept in its entirety the austere ugliness of those asylums of\npenitence and prayer.\n\nBy dint of studying the problem in all its phases, he concluded that\nthe end to be attained could thus be stated: to devise a sombre effect\nby means of cheerful objects, or rather to give a tone of elegance and\ndistinction to the room thus treated, meanwhile preserving its\ncharacter of ugliness; to reverse the practice of the theatre, whose\nvile tinsel imitates sumptuous and costly textures; to obtain the\ncontrary effect by use of splendid fabrics; in a word, to have the\ncell of a Carthusian monk which should possess the appearance of\nreality without in fact being so.\n\nThus he proceeded. To imitate the stone-color of ochre and clerical\nyellow, he had his walls covered with saffron silk; to stimulate the\nchocolate hue of the dadoes common to this type of room, he used\npieces of violet wood deepened with amarinth. The effect was\nbewitching, while recalling to Des Esseintes the repellant rigidity of\nthe model he had followed and yet transformed. The ceiling, in turn,\nwas hung with white, unbleached cloth, in imitation of plaster, but\nwithout its discordant brightness. As for the cold pavement of the\ncell, he was able to copy it, by means of a bit of rug designed in red\nsquares, with whitish spots in the weave to imitate the wear of\nsandals and the friction of boots.\n\nInto this chamber he introduced a small iron bed, the kind used by\nmonks, fashioned of antique, forged and polished iron, the head and\nfoot adorned with thick filigrees of blossoming tulips enlaced with\nvine branches and leaves. Once this had been part of a balustrade of\nan old hostel's superb staircase.\n\nFor his table, he installed an antique praying-desk the inside of\nwhich could contain an urn and the outside a prayer book. Against the\nwall, opposite it, he placed a church pew surmounted by a tall dais\nwith little benches carved out of solid wood. His church tapers were\nmade of real wax, procured from a special house which catered\nexclusively to houses of worship, for Des Esseintes professed a\nsincere repugnance to gas, oil and ordinary candles, to all modern\nforms of illumination, so gaudy and brutal.\n\nBefore going to sleep in the morning, he would gaze, with his head on\nthe pillows, at his El Greco whose barbaric color rebuked the smiling,\nyellow material and recalled it to a more serious tone. Then he could\neasily imagine himself living a hundred leagues removed from Paris,\nfar from society, in cloistral security.\n\nAnd, all in all, the illusion was not difficult, since he led an\nexistence that approached the life of a monk. Thus he had the\nadvantages of monasticism without the inconveniences of its vigorous\ndiscipline, its lack of service, its dirt, its promiscuity and its\nmonotonous idleness. Just as he had transformed his cell into a\ncomfortable chamber, so had he made his life normal, pleasant,\nsurrounded by comforts, occupied and free.\n\nLike a hermit he was ripe for isolation, since life harassed him and\nhe no longer desired anything of it. Again like a monk, he was\ndepressed and in the grip of an obsessing lassitude, seized with the\nneed of self-communion and with a desire to have nothing in common\nwith the profane who were, for him, the utilitarian and the imbecile.\n\nAlthough he experienced no inclination for the state of grace, he felt\na genuine sympathy for those souls immured in monasteries, persecuted\nby a vengeful society which can forgive neither the merited scorn with\nwhich it inspires them, nor the desire to expiate, to atone by long\nsilences, for the ever growing shamelessness of its ridiculous or\ntrifling gossipings.\n\n\n\n\n    Chapter 7\n\n\nEver since the night when he had evoked, for no apparent reason, a\nwhole train of melancholy memories, pictures of his past life returned\nto Des Esseintes and gave him no peace.\n\nHe found himself unable to understand a single word of the books he\nread. He could not even receive impressions through his eyes. It\nseemed to him that his mind, saturated with literature and art,\nrefused to absorb any more.\n\nHe lived within himself, nourished by his own substance, like some\ntorpid creature which hibernates in caves. Solitude had reacted upon\nhis brain like a narcotic. After having strained and enervated it, his\nmind had fallen victim to a sluggishness which annihilated his plans,\nbroke his will power and invoked a cortege of vague reveries to which\nhe passively submitted.\n\nThe confused medley of meditations on art and literature in which he\nhad indulged since his isolation, as a dam to bar the current of old\nmemories, had been rudely swept away, and the onrushing, irresistible\nwave crashed into the present and future, submerging everything\nbeneath the blanket of the past, filling his mind with an immensity of\nsorrow, on whose surface floated, like futile wreckage, absurd trifles\nand dull episodes of his life.\n\nThe book he held in his hands fell to his knees. He abandoned himself\nto the mood which dominated him, watching the dead years of his life\nfilled with so many disgusts and fears, move past. What a life he had\nlived! He thought of the evenings spent in society, the horse races,\ncard parties, love affairs ordered in advance and served at the stroke\nof midnight, in his rose-colored boudoir! He recalled faces,\nexpressions, vain words which obsessed him with the stubbornness of\npopular melodies which one cannot help humming, but which suddenly and\ninexplicably end by boring one.\n\nThis phase had not lasted long. His memory gave him respite and he\nplunged again into his Latin studies, so as to efface the impressions\nof such recollections.\n\nBut almost instantly the rushing force of his memories swept him into\na second phase, that of his childhood, especially of the years spent\nat the school of the Fathers.\n\nAlthough more remote, they were more positive and more indelibly\nstamped on his brain. The leafy park, the long walks, the flower beds,\nthe benches--all the actual details of the monastery rose before him,\nhere in his room.\n\nThe gardens filled and he heard the ringing cries of the students,\nmingling with the laughter of the professors as they played tennis,\nwith their cassocks tucked up between their knees, or perhaps chatted\nunder the trees with the youngsters, without any posturing or hauteur,\nas though they were companions of the same age.\n\nHe recalled the easy yoke of the monks who declined to administer\npunishment by inflicting the committment of five hundred or a thousand\nlines while the others were at play, being satisfied with making those\ndelinquents prepare the lesson that had not been mastered, and most\noften simply having recourse to a gentle admonition. They surrounded\nthe children with an active but gentle watch, seeking to please them,\nconsenting to whatever expeditions they wished to take on Tuesdays,\ntaking the occasion of every minor holiday not formally observed by\nthe Church to add cakes and wine to the ordinary fare, and to\nentertain them with picnics. It was a paternal discipline whose\nsuccess lay in the fact that they did not seek to domineer over the\npupils, that they gossiped with them, treating them as men while\nshowering them with the attentions paid a spoiled child.\n\nIn this manner, the monks succeeded in assuming a real influence over\nthe youngsters; in molding, to some extent, the minds which they were\ncultivating; in directing them, in a sense; in instilling special\nideas; in assuring the growth of their thoughts by insinuating,\nwheedling methods with which they continued to flatter them throughout\ntheir careers, taking pains not to lose sight of them in their later\nlife, and by sending them affectionate letters like those which the\nDominican Lacordaire so skillfully wrote to his former pupils of\nSorreze.\n\nDes Esseintes took note of this system which had been so fruitlessly\nexpended on him. His stubborn, captious and inquisitive character,\ndisposed to controversies, had prevented him from being modelled by\ntheir discipline or subdued by their lessons. His scepticism had\nincreased after he left the precincts of the college. His association\nwith a legitimist, intolerant and shallow society, his conversations\nwith unintelligent church wardens and abbots, whose blunders tore away\nthe veil so subtly woven by the Jesuits, had still more fortified his\nspirit of independence and increased his scorn for any faith whatever.\n\nHe had deemed himself free of all bonds and constraints. Unlike most\ngraduates of _lycees_ or private schools, he had preserved a vivid\nmemory of his college and of his masters. And now, as he considered\nthese matters, he asked himself if the seeds sown until now on barren\nsoil were not beginning to take root.\n\nFor several days, in fact, his soul had been strangely perturbed. At\nmoments, he felt himself veering towards religion. Then, at the\nslightest approach of reason, his faith would dissolve. Yet he\nremained deeply troubled.\n\nAnalyzing himself, he was well aware that he would never possess a\ntruly Christian spirit of humility and penitence. He knew without a\ndoubt that he would never experience that moment of grace mentioned by\nLacordaire, \"when the last shaft of light penetrates the soul and\nunites the truths there lying dispersed.\" He never felt the need of\nmortification and of prayer, without which no conversion in possible,\nif one is to believe the majority of priests. He had no desire to\nimplore a God whose forgiveness seemed most improbable. Yet the\nsympathy he felt for his old teachers lent him an interest in their\nworks and doctrines. Those inimitable accents of conviction, those\nardent voices of men of indubitably superior intelligence returned to\nhim and led him to doubt his own mind and strength. Amid the solitude\nin which he lived, without new nourishment, without any fresh\nexperiences, without any renovation of thought, without that exchange\nof sensations common to society, in this unnatural confinement in\nwhich he persisted, all the questionings forgotten during his stay in\nParis were revived as active irritants. The reading of his beloved\nLatin works, almost all of them written by bishops and monks, had\ndoubtless contributed to this crisis. Enveloped in a convent-like\natmosphere, in a heady perfume of incense, his nervous brain had grown\nexcitable. And by an association of ideas, these books had driven back\nthe memories of his life as a young man, revealing in full light the\nyears spent with the Fathers.\n\n\"There is no doubt about it,\" Des Esseintes mused, as he reasoned the\nmatter and followed the progress of this introduction of the Jesuitic\nspirit into Fontenay. \"Since my childhood, although unaware of it, I\nhave had this leaven which has never fermented. The weakness I have\nalways borne for religious subjects is perhaps a positive proof of\nit.\" But he sought to persuade himself to the contrary, disturbed at\nno longer being his own master. He searched for motives; it had\nrequired a struggle for him to abandon things sacerdotal, since the\nChurch alone had treasured objects of art--the lost forms of past\nages. Even in its wretched modern reproductions, she had preserved the\ncontours of the gold and silver ornaments, the charm of chalices\ncurving like petunias, and the charm of pyxes with their chaste sides;\neven in aluminum and imitation enamels and colored glasses, she had\npreserved the grace of vanished modes. In short, most of the precious\nobjects now to be found in the Cluny museum, which have miraculously\nescaped the crude barbarism of the philistines, come from the ancient\nFrench abbeys. And just as the Church had preserved philosophy and\nhistory and letters from barbarism in the Middle Ages, so had she\nsaved the plastic arts, bringing to our own days those marvelous\nfabrics and jewelries which the makers of sacred objects spoil to the\nbest of their ability, without being able to destroy the originally\nexquisite form. It followed, then, that there was nothing surprising\nin his having bought these old trinkets, in his having, together with\na number of other collectors, purchased such relics from the antique\nshops of Paris and the second-hand dealers of the provinces.\n\nBut these reasons he evoked in vain. He did not wholly succeed in\nconvincing himself. He persisted in considering religion as a superb\nlegend, a magnificent imposture. Yet, despite his convictions, his\nscepticism began to be shattered.\n\nThis was the singular fact he was obliged to face: he was less\nconfident now than in childhood, when he had been directly under the\ninfluence of the Jesuits, when their instruction could not be shunned,\nwhen he was in their hands and belonged to them body and soul, without\nfamily ties, with no outside influence powerful enough to counteract\ntheir precepts. Moreover, they had inculcated in him a certain\ntendency towards the marvelous which, interned and exercised in the\nclose quarters of his fixed ideas, had slowly and obscurely developed\nin his soul, until today it was blossoming in his solitude, affecting\nhis spirit, regardless of arguments.\n\nBy examining the process of his reasoning, by seeking to unite its\nthreads and to discover its sources and causes, he concluded that his\nprevious mode of living was derived from the education he had\nreceived. Thus, his tendencies towards artificiality and his craving\nfor eccentricity, were no more than the results of specious studies,\nspiritual refinements and quasi-theological speculations. They were,\nin the last analysis, ecstacies, aspirations towards an ideal, towards\nan unknown universe as desirable as that promised us by the Holy\nScriptures.\n\nHe curbed his thoughts sharply and broke the thread of his\nreflections.\n\n\"Well!\" he thought, vexed, \"I am even more affected than I had\nimagined. Here am I arguing with myself like a very casuist!\"\n\nHe was left pensive, agitated by a vague fear. Certainly, if\nLacordaire's theory were sound, he had nothing to be afraid of, since\nthe magic touch of conversion is not to be consummated in a moment. To\nbring about the explosion, the ground must be constantly and\nassiduously mined. But just as the romancers speak of the thunderclap\nof love, so do theologians also speak of the thunderclap of\nconversion. No one was safe, should one admit the truth of this\ndoctrine. There was no longer any need of self-analysis, of paying\nheed to presentiments, of taking preventive measures. The psychology\nof mysticism was void. Things were so because they were so, and that\nwas all.\n\n\"I am really becoming stupid,\" thought Des Esseintes. \"The very fear\nof this malady will end by bringing it on, if this continues.\"\n\nHe partially succeeded in shaking off this influence. The memories of\nhis life with the Jesuits waned, only to be replaced by other\nthoughts. He was entirely dominated by morbid abstractions. Despite\nhimself, he thought of the contradictory interpretations of the\ndogmas, of the lost apostasies of Father Labbe, recorded in the works\non the Decrees. Fragments of these schisms, scraps of these heresies\nwhich for centuries had divided the Churches of the Orient and the\nOccident, returned to him.\n\nHere, Nestorius denied the title of \"Mother of God\" to the Virgin\nbecause, in the mystery of the Incarnation, it was not God but rather\na human being she had nourished in her womb; there, Eutyches declared\nthat Christ's image could not resemble that of other men, since\ndivinity had chosen to dwell in his body and had consequently entirely\naltered the form of everything. Other quibblers maintained that the\nRedeemer had had no body at all and that this expression of the holy\nbooks must be taken figuratively, while Tertullian put forth his\nfamous, semi-materialistic axiom: \"Only that which is not, has no\nbody; everything which is, has a body fitting it.\" Finally, this\nancient question, debated for years, demanded an answer: was Christ\nhanged on the cross, or was it the Trinity which had suffered as one\nin its triple hypostasis, on the cross at Calvary? And mechanically,\nlike a lesson long ago learned, he proposed the questions to himself\nand answered them.\n\nFor several days his brain was a swarm of paradoxes, subtleties and\nhair-splittings, a skein of rules as complicated as the articles of\nthe codes that involved the sense of everything, indulged in puns and\nended in a most tenuous and singular celestial jurisprudence. The\nabstract side vanished, in its turn, and under the influence of the\nGustave Moreau paintings of the wall, yielded to a concrete succession\nof pictures.\n\nBefore him he saw marching a procession of prelates. The\narchimandrites and patriarchs, their white beards waving during the\nreading of the prayers, lifted golden arms to bless kneeling throngs.\nHe saw silent files of penitents marching into dim crypts. Before him\nrose vast cathedrals where white monks intoned from pulpits. Just as\nDe Quincey, having taken a dose of opium and uttered the word \"Consul\nRomanus,\" evoked entire pages of Livius, and beheld the solemn advance\nof the consuls and the magnificent, pompous march of the Roman armies,\nso he, at a theological expression, paused breathless as he viewed the\nonrush of penitents and the churchly apparitions which detached\nthemselves from the glowing depths of the basilica. These scenes held\nhim enchanted. They moved from age to age, culminating in the modern\nreligious ceremonies, bathing his soul in a tender, mournful infinity\nof music.\n\nOn this plane, no reasonings were necessary; there were no further\ncontests to be endured. He had an indescribable impression of respect\nand fear. His artistic sense was conquered by the skillfully\ncalculated Catholic rituals. His nerves quivered at these memories.\nThen, in sudden rebellion, in a sudden reversion, monstrous ideas were\nborn in him, fancies concerning those sacrileges warned against by the\nmanual of the Father confessors, of the scandalous, impure desecration\nof holy water and sacred oil. The Demon, a powerful rival, now stood\nagainst an omnipotent God. A frightful grandeur seemed to Des\nEsseintes to emanate from a crime committed in church by a believer\nbent, with blasphemously horrible glee and sadistic joy, over such\nrevered objects, covering them with outrages and saturating them in\nopprobrium.\n\nBefore him were conjured up the madnesses of magic, of the black mass,\nof the witches' revels, of terrors of possessions and of exorcisms. He\nreached the point where he wondered if he were not committing a\nsacrilege in possessing objects which had once been consecrated: the\nChurch canons, chasubles and pyx covers. And this idea of a state of\nsin imparted to him a mixed sensation of pride and relief. The\npleasures of sacrilege were unravelled from the skein of this idea,\nbut these were debatable sacrileges, in any case, and hardly serious,\nsince he really loved these objects and did not pollute them by\nmisuse. In this wise he lulled himself with prudent and cowardly\nthoughts, the caution of his soul forbidding obvious crimes and\ndepriving him of the courage necessary to the consummation of\nfrightful and deliberate sins.\n\nLittle by little this tendency to ineffectual quibbling disappeared.\nIn his mind's eye he saw the panorama of the Church with its\nhereditary influence on humanity through the centuries. He imagined it\nas imposing and suffering, emphasizing to man the horror of life, the\ninfelicity of man's destiny; preaching patience, penitence and the\nspirit of sacrifice; seeking to heal wounds, while it displayed the\nbleeding wounds of Christ; bespeaking divine privileges; promising the\nrichest part of paradise to the afflicted; exhorting humanity to\nsuffer and to render to God, like a holocaust, its trials and\noffenses, its vicissitudes and pains. Thus the Church grew truly\neloquent, the beneficent mother of the oppressed, the eternal menace\nof oppressors and despots.\n\nHere, Des Esseintes was on firm ground. He was thoroughly satisfied\nwith this admission of social ordure, but he revolted against the\nvague hope of remedy in the beyond. Schopenhauer was more true. His\ndoctrine and that of the Church started from common premises. He, too,\nbased his system on the vileness of the world; he, too, like the\nauthor of the _Imitation of Christ_, uttered that grievous outcry:\n\"Truly life on earth is wretched.\" He, also, preached the nothingness\nof life, the advantages of solitude, and warned humanity that no\nmatter what it does, in whatever direction it may turn, it must remain\nwretched, the poor by reason of the sufferings entailed by want, the\nrich by reason of the unconquerable weariness engendered by abundance;\nbut this philosophy promised no universal remedies, did not entice one\nwith false hopes, so as to minimize the inevitable evils of life.\n\nHe did not affirm the revolting conception of original sin, nor did he\nfeel inclined to argue that it is a beneficent God who protects the\nworthless and wicked, rains misfortunes on children, stultifies the\naged and afflicts the innocent. He did not exalt the virtues of a\nProvidence which has invented that useless, incomprehensible, unjust\nand senseless abomination, physical suffering. Far from seeking to\njustify, as does the Church, the necessity of torments and\nafflictions, he cried, in his outraged pity: \"If a God has made this\nworld, I should not wish to be that God. The world's wretchedness\nwould rend my heart.\"\n\nAh! Schopenhauer alone was right. Compared with these treatises of\nspiritual hygiene, of what avail were the evangelical pharmacopoeias?\nHe did not claim to cure anything, and he offered no alleviation to\nthe sick. But his theory of pessimism was, in the end, the great\nconsoler of choice intellects and lofty souls. He revealed society as\nit is, asserted woman's inherent stupidity, indicated the safest\ncourse, preserved you from disillusionment by warning you to restrain\nhopes as much as possible, to refuse to yield to their allurement, to\ndeem yourself fortunate, finally, if they did not come toppling about\nyour ears at some unexpected moment.\n\nTraversing the same path as the _Imitation_, this theory, too, ended\nin similar highways of resignation and indifference, but without going\nastray in mysterious labyrinths and remote roads.\n\nBut if this resignation, which was obviously the only outcome of the\ndeplorable condition of things and their irremediability, was open to\nthe spiritually rich, it was all the more difficult of approach to the\npoor whose passions and cravings were more easily satisfied by the\nbenefits of religion.\n\nThese reflections relieved Des Esseintes of a heavy burden. The\naphorisms of the great German calmed his excited thoughts, and the\npoints of contact in these two doctrines helped him to correlate them;\nand he could never forget that poignant and poetic Catholicism in\nwhich he had bathed, and whose essence he had long ago absorbed.\n\nThese reversions to religion, these intimations of faith tormented him\nparticularly since the changes that had lately taken place in his\nhealth. Their progress coincided with that of his recent nervous\ndisorders.\n\nHe had been tortured since his youth by inexplicable aversions, by\nshudderings which chilled his spine and made him grit his teeth, as,\nfor example, when he saw a girl wringing wet linen. These reactions\nhad long persisted. Even now he suffered poignantly when he heard the\ntearing of cloth, the rubbing of a finger against a piece of chalk, or\na hand touching a bit of moire.\n\nThe excesses of his youthful life, the exaggerated tension of his mind\nhad strangely aggravated his earliest nervous disorder, and had\nthinned the already impoverished blood of his race. In Paris, he had\nbeen compelled to submit to hydrotherapic treatments for his trembling\nfingers, frightful pains, neuralgic strokes which cut his face in two,\ndrummed maddeningly against his temples, pricked his eyelids\nagonizingly and induced a nausea which could be dispelled only by\nlying flat on his back in the dark.\n\nThese afflictions had gradually disappeared, thanks to a more\nregulated and sane mode of living. They now returned in another form,\nattacking his whole body. The pains left his head, but affected his\ninflated stomach. His entrails seemed pierced by hot bars of iron. A\nnervous cough racked him at regular intervals, awakening and almost\nstrangling him in his bed. Then his appetite forsook him; gaseous, hot\nacids and dry heats coursed through his stomach. He grew swollen, was\nchoked for breath, and could not endure his clothes after each attempt\nat eating.\n\nHe shunned alcoholic beverages, coffee and tea, and drank only milk.\nAnd he took recourse to baths of cold water and dosed himself with\nassafoetida, valerian and quinine. He even felt a desire to go out,\nand strolled about the country when the rainy days came to make it\ndesolate and still. He obliged himself to take exercise. As a last\nresort, he temporarily abandoned his books and, corroded with ennui,\ndetermined to make his listless life tolerable by realizing a project\nhe had long deferred through laziness and a dislike of change, since\nhis installment at Fontenay.\n\nBeing no longer able to intoxicate himself with the felicities of\nstyle, with the delicious witchery of the rare epithet which, while\nremaining precise, yet opens to the imagination of the initiate\ninfinite and distant vistas, he determined to give the finishing\ntouches to the decorations of his home. He would procure precious\nhot-house flowers and thus permit himself a material occupation which\nmight distract him, calm his nerves and rest his brain. He also hoped\nthat the sight of their strange and splendid nuances would in some\ndegree atone for the fanciful and genuine colors of style which he was\nfor the time to lose from his literary diet.\n\n\n\n\n    Chapter 8\n\n\nHe had always been passionately fond of flowers, but during his\nresidence at Jutigny, that love had been lavished upon flowers of all\nsorts; he had never cultivated distinctions and discriminations in\nregard to them. Now his taste in this direction had grown refined and\nself-conscious.\n\nFor a long time he had scorned the popular plants which grow in flat\nbaskets, in watered pots, under green awnings or under the red\nparasols of Parisian markets.\n\nSimultaneous with the refinement of his literary taste and his\npreoccupations with art, which permitted him to be content only in the\npresence of choice creations, distilled by subtly troubled brains, and\nsimultaneous with the weariness he began to feel in the presence of\npopular ideas, his love for flowers had grown purged of all impurities\nand lees, and had become clarified.\n\nHe compared a florist's shop to a microcosm wherein all the categories\nof society are represented. Here are poor common flowers, the kind\nfound in hovels, which are truly at home only when resting on ledges\nof garret windows, their roots thrust into milk bottles and old pans,\nlike the gilly-flower for example.\n\nAnd one also finds stupid and pretentious flowers like the rose which\nbelongs in the porcelain flowerpots painted by young girls.\n\nThen, there are flowers of noble lineage like the orchid, so delicate\nand charming, at once cold and palpitating, exotic flowers exiled in\nthe heated glass palaces of Paris, princesses of the vegetable kingdom\nliving in solitude, having absolutely nothing in common with the\nstreet plants and other bourgeois flora.\n\nHe permitted himself to feel a certain interest and pity only for the\npopular flowers enfeebled by their nearness to the odors of sinks and\ndrains in the poor quarters. In revenge he detested the bouquets\nharmonizing with the cream and gold rooms of pretentious houses. For\nthe joy of his eyes he reserved those distinguished, rare blooms which\nhad been brought from distant lands and whose lives were sustained by\nartful devices under artificial equators.\n\nBut this very choice, this predilection for the conservatory plants\nhad itself changed under the influence of his mode of thought.\nFormerly, during his Parisian days, his love for artificiality had led\nhim to abandon real flowers and to use in their place replicas\nfaithfully executed by means of the miracles performed with India\nrubber and wire, calico and taffeta, paper and silk. He was the\npossessor of a marvelous collection of tropical plants, the result of\nthe labors of skilful artists who knew how to follow nature and\nrecreate her step by step, taking the flower as a bud, leading it to\nits full development, even imitating its decline, reaching such a\npoint of perfection as to convey every nuance--the most fugitive\nexpressions of the flower when it opens at dawn and closes at evening,\nobserving the appearance of the petals curled by the wind or rumpled\nby the rain, applying dew drops of gum on its matutinal corollas;\nshaping it in full bloom, when the branches bend under the burden of\ntheir sap, or showing the dried stem and shrivelled cupules, when\ncalyxes are thrown off and leaves fall to the ground.\n\nThis wonderful art had held him entranced for a long while, but now he\nwas dreaming of another experiment.\n\nHe wished to go one step beyond. Instead of artificial flowers\nimitating real flowers, natural flowers should mimic the artificial\nones.\n\nHe directed his ideas to this end and had not to seek long or go far,\nsince his house lay in the very heart of a famous horticultural\nregion. He visited the conservatories of the Avenue de Chatillon and\nof the Aunay valley, and returned exhausted, his purse empty,\nastonished at the strange forms of vegetation he had seen, thinking of\nnothing but the species he had acquired and continually haunted by\nmemories of magnificent and fantastic plants.\n\nThe flowers came several days later.\n\nDes Esseintes holding a list in his hands, verified each one of his\npurchases. The gardeners from their wagons brought a collection of\ncaladiums which sustained enormous heartshaped leaves on turgid hairy\nstalks; while preserving an air of relationship with its neighbor, no\none leaf repeated the same pattern.\n\nOthers were equally extraordinary. The roses like the _Virginale_\nseemed cut out of varnished cloth or oil-silks; the white ones, like\nthe _Albano_, appeared to have been cut out of an ox's transparent\npleura, or the diaphanous bladder of a pig. Some, particularly the\n_Madame Mame_, imitated zinc and parodied pieces of stamped metal\nhaving a hue of emperor green, stained by drops of oil paint and by\nspots of white and red lead; others like the _Bosphorous_, gave the\nillusion of a starched calico in crimson and myrtle green; still\nothers, like the _Aurora Borealis_, displayed leaves having the color\nof raw meat, streaked with purple sides, violet fibrils, tumefied\nleaves from which oozed blue wine and blood.\n\nThe _Albano_ and the _Aurora_ sounded the two extreme notes of\ntemperament, the apoplexy and chlorosis of this plant.\n\nThe gardeners brought still other varieties which had the appearance\nof artificial skin ridged with false veins, and most of them looked as\nthough consumed by syphilis and leprosy, for they exhibited livid\nsurfaces of flesh veined with scarlet rash and damasked with\neruptions. Some had the deep red hue of scars that have just closed or\nthe dark tint of incipient scabs. Others were marked with matter\nraised by scaldings. There were forms which exhibited shaggy skins\nhollowed by ulcers and relieved by cankers. And a few appeared\nembossed with wounds, covered with black mercurial hog lard, with\ngreen unguents of belladonna smeared with grains of dust and the\nyellow micas of iodoforme.\n\nCollected in his home, these flowers seemed to Des Esseintes more\nmonstrous than when he had beheld them, confused with others among the\nglass rooms of the conservatory.\n\n\"_Sapristi!_\" he exclaimed enthusiastically.\n\nA new plant, modelled like the Caladiums, the _Alocasia Metallica_,\nexcited him even more. It was coated with a layer of bronze green on\nwhich glanced silver reflections. It was the masterpiece of\nartificiality. It could be called a piece of stove pipe, cut by a\nchimney-maker into the form of a pike head.\n\nThe men next brought clusters of leaves, lozenge-like in shape and\nbottle-green in color. In the center rose a rod at whose end a\nvarnished ace of hearts swayed. As though meaning to defy all\nconceivable forms of plants, a fleshy stalk climbed through the heart\nof this intense vermilion ace--a stalk that in some specimens was\nstraight, in others showed ringlets like a pig's tail.\n\nIt was the _Anthurium_, an aroid recently imported into France from\nColumbia; a variety of that family to which also belonged an\n_Amorphophallus_, a Cochin China plant with leaves shaped like\nfish-knives, with long dark stems seamed with gashes, like lambs\nflecked with black.\n\nDes Esseintes exulted.\n\nThey brought a new batch of monstrosities from the wagon:\n_Echinopses_, issuing from padded compresses with rose-colored flowers\nthat looked like the pitiful stumps; gaping _Nidularia_ revealing\nskinless foundations in steel plates; _Tillandsia Lindeni_, the color\nof wine must, with jagged scrapers; _Cypripedia_, with complicated\ncontours, a crazy piece of work seemingly designed by a crazy\ninventor. They looked like sabots or like a lady's work-table on which\nlies a human tongue with taut filaments, such as one sees designed on\nthe illustrated pages of works treating of the diseases of the throat\nand mouth; two little side-pieces, of a red jujube color, which\nappeared to have been borrowed from a child's toy mill completed this\nsingular collection of a tongue's underside with the color of slate\nand wine lees, and of a glossy pocket from whose lining oozed a\nviscous glue.\n\nHe could not remove his eyes from this unnatural orchid which had been\nbrought from India. Then the gardeners, impatient at his\nprocrastinations, themselves began to read the labels fastened to the\npots they were carrying in.\n\nBewildered, Des Esseintes looked on and listened to the cacophonous\nsounds of the names: the _Encephalartos horridus_, a gigantic iron\nrust-colored artichoke, like those put on portals of chateaux to foil\nwall climbers; the _Cocos Micania_, a sort of notched and slender palm\nsurrounded by tall leaves resembling paddles and oars; the _Zamia\nLehmanni_, an immense pineapple, a wondrous Chester leaf, planted in\nsweet-heather soil, its top bristling with barbed javelins and jagged\narrows; the _Cibotium Spectabile_, surpassing the others by the\ncraziness of its structure, hurling a defiance to revery, as it\ndarted, through the palmated foliage, an enormous orang-outang tail, a\nhairy dark tail whose end was twisted into the shape of a bishop's\ncross.\n\nBut he gave little heed, for he was impatiently awaiting the series of\nplants which most bewitched him, the vegetable ghouls, the carnivorous\nplants; the _Antilles Fly-Trap_, with its shaggy border, secreting a\ndigestive liquid, armed with crooked prickles coiling around each\nother, forming a grating about the imprisoned insect; the _Drosera_ of\nthe peat-bogs, provided with glandular hair; the _Sarracena_ and the\n_Cephalothus_, opening greedy horns capable of digesting and absorbing\nreal meat; lastly, the _Nepenthes_, whose capricious appearance\ntranscends all limits of eccentric forms.\n\nHe never wearied of turning in his hands the pot in which this floral\nextravagance stirred. It imitated the gum-tree whose long leaf of dark\nmetallic green it possessed, but it differed in that a green string\nhung from the end of its leaf, an umbilic cord supporting a greenish\nurn, streaked with jasper, a sort of German porcelain pipe, a strange\nbird's nest which tranquilly swung about, revealing an interior\ncovered with hair.\n\n\"This is really something worth while,\" Des Esseintes murmured.\n\nHe was forced to tear himself away, for the gardeners, anxious to\nleave, were emptying the wagons of their contents and depositing,\nwithout any semblance of order, the tuberous _Begonias_ and black\n_Crotons_ stained like sheet iron with Saturn red.\n\nThen he perceived that one name still remained on his list. It was the\n_Cattleya_ of New Granada. On it was designed a little winged bell of\na faded lilac, an almost dead mauve. He approached, placed his nose\nabove the plant and quickly recoiled. It exhaled an odor of toy boxes\nof painted pine; it recalled the horrors of a New Year's Day.\n\nHe felt that he would do well to mistrust it and he almost regretted\nhaving admitted, among the scentless plants, this orchid which evoked\nthe most disagreeable memories.\n\nAs soon as he was alone his gaze took in this vegetable tide which\nfoamed in the vestibule. Intermingled with each other, they crossed\ntheir swords, their krisses and stanchions, taking on a resemblance to\na green pile of arms, above which, like barbaric penons, floated\nflowers with hard dazzling colors.\n\nThe air of the room grew rarefied. Then, in the shadowy dimness of a\ncorner, near the floor, a white soft light crept.\n\nHe approached and perceived that the phenomenon came from the\n_Rhizomorphes_ which threw out these night-lamp gleams while\nrespiring.\n\n\"These plants are amazing,\" he reflected. Then he drew back to let his\neye encompass the whole collection at a glance. His purpose was\nachieved. Not one single specimen seemed real; the cloth, paper,\nporcelain and metal seemed to have been loaned by man to nature to\nenable her to create her monstrosities. When unable to imitate man's\nhandiwork, nature had been reduced to copying the inner membranes of\nanimals, to borrowing the vivid tints of their rotting flesh, their\nmagnificent corruptions.\n\n\"All is syphilis,\" thought Des Esseintes, his eye riveted upon the\nhorrible streaked stainings of the Caladium plants caressed by a ray\nof light. And he beheld a sudden vision of humanity consumed through\nthe centuries by the virus of this disease. Since the world's\nbeginnings, every single creature had, from sire to son, transmitted\nthe imperishable heritage, the eternal malady which has ravaged man's\nancestors and whose effects are visible even in the bones of old\nfossils that have been exhumed.\n\nThe disease had swept on through the centuries gaining momentum. It\neven raged today, concealed in obscure sufferings, dissimulated under\nsymptoms of headaches and bronchitis, hysterics and gout. It crept to\nthe surface from time to time, preferably attacking the ill-nourished\nand the poverty stricken, spotting faces with gold pieces, ironically\ndecorating the faces of poor wretches, stamping the mark of money on\ntheir skins to aggravate their unhappiness.\n\nAnd here on the colored leaves of the plants it was resurgent in its\noriginal splendor.\n\n\"It is true,\" pursued Des Esseintes, returning to the course of\nreasoning he had momentarily abandoned, \"it is true that most often\nnature, left alone, is incapable of begetting such perverse and sickly\nspecimens. She furnishes the original substance, the germ and the\nearth, the nourishing womb and the elements of the plant which man\nthen sets up, models, paints, and sculpts as he wills. Limited,\nstubborn and formless though she be, nature has at last been subjected\nand her master has succeeded in changing, through chemical reaction,\nthe earth's substances, in using combinations which had been long\nmatured, cross-fertilization processes long prepared, in making use of\nslips and graftings, and man now forces differently colored flowers in\nthe same species, invests new tones for her, modifies to his will the\nlong-standing form of her plants, polishes the rough clods, puts an\nend to the period of botch work, places his stamp on them, imposes on\nthem the mark of his own unique art.\"\n\n\"It cannot be gainsaid,\" he thought, resuming his reflections, \"that\nman in several years is able to effect a selection which slothful\nnature can produce only after centuries. Decidedly the horticulturists\nare the real artists nowadays.\"\n\nHe was a little tired and he felt stifled in this atmosphere of\ncrowded plants. The promenades he had taken during the last few days\nhad exhausted him. The transition had been too sudden from the tepid\natmosphere of his room to the out-of-doors, from the placid\ntranquillity of a reclusive life to an active one. He left the\nvestibule and stretched out on his bed to rest, but, absorbed by this\nnew fancy of his, his mind, even in his sleep, could not lessen its\ntension and he was soon wandering among the gloomy insanities of a\nnightmare.\n\nHe found himself in the center of a walk, in the heart of the wood;\ntwilight had fallen. He was strolling by the side of a woman whom he\nhad never seen before. She was emaciated and had flaxen hair, a\nbulldog face, freckles on her cheeks, crooked teeth projecting under a\nflat nose. She wore a nurse's white apron, a long neckerchief, torn in\nstrips on her bosom; half-shoes like those worn by Prussian soldiers\nand a black bonnet adorned with frillings and trimmed with a rosette.\n\nThere was a foreign look about her, like that of a mountebank at a\nfair.\n\nHe asked himself who the woman could be; he felt that she had long\nbeen an intimate part of his life; vainly he sought her origin, her\nname, her profession, her reason for being. No recollection of this\nliaison, which was inexplicable and yet positive, rewarded him.\n\nHe was searching his past for a clue, when a strange figure suddenly\nappeared on horse-back before them, trotting about for a moment and\nthen turning around in its saddle. Des Esseintes' heart almost stopped\nbeating and he stood riveted to the spot with horror. He nearly\nfainted. This enigmatic, sexless figure was green; through her violet\neyelids the eyes were terrible in their cold blue; pimples surrounded\nher mouth; horribly emaciated, skeleton arms bared to the elbows\nissued from ragged tattered sleeves and trembled feverishly; and the\nskinny legs shivered in shoes that were several sizes too large.\n\nThe ghastly eyes were fixed on Des Esseintes, penetrating him,\nfreezing his very marrow; wilder than ever, the bulldog woman threw\nherself at him and commenced to howl like a dog at the killing, her\nhead hanging on her rigid neck.\n\nSuddenly he understood the meaning of the frightful vision. Before him\nwas the image of Syphilis.\n\nPursued by fear and quite beside himself, he sped down a pathway at\ntop speed and gained a pavillion standing among the laburnums to the\nleft, where he fell into a chair, in the passage way.\n\nAfter a few moments, when he was beginning to recover his breath, the\nsound of sobbing made him lift his head. The bulldog woman was in\nfront of him and, grotesque and woeful, while warm tears fell from her\neyes, she told him that she had lost her teeth in her flight. As she\nspoke she drew clay pipes from the pocket of her nurse's apron,\nbreaking them and shoving pieces of the stems into the hollows of her\ngums.\n\n\"But she is really absurd,\" Des Esseintes told himself. \"These stems\nwill never stick.\" And, as a matter of fact, they dropped out one\nafter another.\n\nAt this moment were heard the galloping sounds of an approaching\nhorse. A fearful terror pierced Des Esseintes. His limbs gave way. The\ngalloping grew louder. Despair brought him sharply to his senses. He\nthrew himself upon the woman who was stamping on the pipe bowls,\nentreating her to be silent, not to give notice of their presence by\nthe sound of her shoes. She writhed and struggled in his grip; he led\nher to the end of the corridor, strangling her to prevent her from\ncrying out. Suddenly he noticed the door of a coffee house, with green\nVenetian shutters. It was unlocked; he pushed it, rushed in headlong\nand then paused.\n\nBefore him, in the center of a vast glade, huge white pierrots were\nleaping rabbit-like under the rays of the moon.\n\nTears of discouragement welled to his eyes; never, no never would he\nsucceed in crossing the threshold. \"I shall be crushed,\" he thought.\nAnd as though to justify his fears, the ranks of tall pierrots swarmed\nand multiplied; their somersaults now covered the entire horizon, the\nwhole sky on which they landed now on their heads, now on their feet.\n\nThen the hoof beats paused. He was in the passage, behind a round\nskylight. More dead than alive, Des Esseintes turned about and through\nthe round window beheld projecting erect ears, yellow teeth, nostrils\nfrom which breathed two jets of vapor smelling of phenol.\n\nHe sank to the ground, renouncing all ideas of flight or of\nresistance. He closed his eyes so as not to behold the horrible gaze\nof Syphilis which penetrated through the wall, which even pierced his\nclosed lids, which he felt gliding over his moist spine, over his body\nwhose hair bristled in pools of cold sweat. He waited for the worst\nand even hoped for the _coup de grace_ to end everything. A moment\nwhich seemed to last a century passed. Shuddering, he opened his eyes.\nEverything had vanished. Without any transition, as though by some\nstage device, a frightful mineral landscape receded into the distance,\na wan, dead, waste, gullied landscape. A light illumined this desolate\nsite, a peaceful white light that recalled gleams of phosphorus\ndissolved in oil.\n\nSomething that stirred on the ground became a deathly pale, nude woman\nwhose feet were covered with green silk stockings.\n\nHe contemplated her with curiosity. As though frizzed by overheated\nirons, her hair curled, becoming straight again at the end; her\ndistended nostrils were the color of roast veal. Her eyes were\ndesirous, and she called to him in low tones.\n\nHe had no time to answer, for already the woman was changing.\nFlamboyant colors passed and repassed in her eyes. Her lips were\nstained with a furious Anthurium red. The nipples of her breasts\nflashed, painted like two pods of red pepper.\n\nA sudden intuition came to him. \"It is the Flower,\" he said. And his\nreasoning mania persisted in his nightmare.\n\nThen he observed the frightful irritation of the breasts and mouth,\ndiscovered spots of bister and copper on the skin of her body, and\nrecoiled bewildered. But the woman's eyes fascinated him and he\nadvanced slowly, attempting to thrust his heels into the earth so as\nnot to move, letting himself fall, and yet lifting himself to reach\nher. Just as he touched her, the dark _Amorphophalli_ leaped up from\nall sides and thrust their leaves into his abdomen which rose and fell\nlike a sea. He had broken all the plants, experiencing a limitless\ndisgust in seeing these warm, firm stems stirring in his hands.\nSuddenly the detested plants had disappeared and two arms sought to\nenlace him. A terrible anguish made his heart beat furiously, for the\neyes, the horrible eyes of the woman, had become a clear, cold and\nterrible blue. He made a superhuman effort to free himself from her\nembrace, but she held him with an irresistible movement. He beheld the\nwild _Nidularium_ which yawned, bleeding, in steel plates.\n\nWith his body he touched the hideous wound of this plant. He felt\nhimself dying, awoke with a start, suffocating, frozen, mad with fear\nand sighing: \"Ah! thank God, it was but a dream!\"\n\n\n\n\n    Chapter 9\n\n\nThese nightmares attacked him repeatedly. He was afraid to fall\nasleep. For hours he remained stretched on his bed, now a prey to\nfeverish and agitated wakefulness, now in the grip of oppressive\ndreams in which he tumbled down flights of stairs and felt himself\nsinking, powerless, into abysmal depths.\n\nHis nervous attacks, which had abated for several days, became acute,\nmore violent and obstinate than ever, unearthing new tortures.\n\nThe bed covers tormented him. He stifled under the sheets, his body\nsmarted and tingled as though stung by swarms of insects. These\nsymptoms were augmented by a dull pain in his jaws and a throbbing in\nhis temples which seemed to be gripped in a vise.\n\nHis alarm increased; but unfortunately the means of subduing the\ninexorable malady were not at hand. He had unsuccessfully sought to\ninstall a hydropathic apparatus in his dressing room. But the\nimpossibility of forcing water to the height on which his house was\nperched, and the difficulty of procuring water even in the village\nwhere the fountains functioned sparingly and only at certain hours of\nthe day, caused him to renounce the project. Since he could not have\nfloods of water playing on him from the nozzle of a hose, (the only\nefficacious means of overcoming his insomnia and calming his nerves\nthrough its action on his spinal column) he was reduced to brief\nsprays or to mere cold baths, followed by energetic massages applied\nby his servant with the aid of a horse-hair glove.\n\nBut these measures failed to stem the march of his nervous disorder.\nAt best they afforded him a few hours' relief, dearly paid for by the\nreturn of the attacks in an even more virulent form.\n\nHis ennui passed all bounds. His pleasure in the possession of his\nwonderful flowers was exhausted. Their textures and nuances palled on\nhim. Besides, despite the care he lavished on them, most of his plants\ndrooped. He had them removed from his rooms, but in his state of\nextreme excitability, their very absence exasperated him, for his eyes\nwere pained by the void.\n\nTo while away the interminable hours, he had recourse to his\nportfolios of prints, and arranged his Goyas. The first impressions of\ncertain plates of the _Caprices_, recognizable as proofs by their\nreddish hues, which he had bought at auction at a high price,\ncomforted him, and he lost himself in them, following the painter's\nfantasies, distracted by his vertiginous scenes, his witches astride\non cats, his women striving to pluck out the teeth of a hanged man,\nhis bandits, his succubi, his demons and dwarfs.\n\nThen he examined his other series of etchings and aquatints, his\n_Proverbs_ with their macabre horror, his war subjects with their wild\nrage, finally his plate of the Garot, of which he cherished a\nmarvelous trial proof, printed on heavy water-marked paper, unmounted.\n\nGoya's savage verve and keenly fanciful talent delighted him, but the\nuniversal admiration his works had won nevertheless estranged him\nslightly. And for years he had refused to frame them for fear that the\nfirst blundering fool who caught sight of them might deem it necessary\nto fly into banal and facile raptures before them.\n\nThe same applied to his Rembrandts which he examined from time to\ntime, half secretly; and if it be true that the loveliest tune\nimaginable becomes vulgar and insupportable as soon as the public\nbegins to hum it and the hurdy-gurdies make it their own, the work of\nart which does not remain indifferent to the spurious artists, which\nis not contested by fools, and which is not satisfied with awakening\nthe enthusiasm of the few, by this very fact becomes profaned, trite,\nalmost repulsive to the initiate.\n\nThis promiscuity in admiration, furthermore, was one of the greatest\nsources of regret in his life. Incomprehensible successes had forever\nspoiled for him many pictures and books once cherished and dear.\nApproved by the mob, they began to reveal imperceptible defects to\nhim, and he rejected them, wondering meanwhile if his perceptions were\nnot growing blunted.\n\nHe closed his portfolios and, completely disconcerted, again plunged\ninto melancholy. To divert the current of his thoughts and cool his\nbrain, he sought books that would soothe him and turned to the\nromances of Dickens, those charming novels which are so satisfying to\ninvalids and convalescents who might grow fatigued by works of a more\nprofound and vigorous nature.\n\nBut they produced an effect contrary to his expectations. These chaste\nlovers, these protesting heroines garbed to the neck, loved among the\nstars, confined themselves to lowered eyes and blushes, wept tears of\njoy and clasped hands--an exaggeration of purity which threw him into\nan opposite excess. By the law of contrast, he leaped from one extreme\nto the other, let his imagination dwell on vibrant scenes between\nhuman lovers, and mused on their sensual kisses and passionate\nembraces.\n\nHis mind wandered off from his book to worlds far removed from the\nEnglish prude: to wanton peccadilloes and salacious practices\ncondemned by the Church. He grew excited. The impotence of his mind\nand body which he had supposed final, vanished. Solitude again acted\non his disordered nerves; he was once more obsessed, not by religion\nitself, but by the acts and sins it forbids, by the subject of all its\nobsecrations and threats. The carnal side, atrophied for months, which\nhad been stirred by the enervation of his pious readings, then brought\nto a crisis by the English cant, came to the surface. His stimulated\nsenses carried him back to the past and he wallowed in memories of his\nold sin.\n\nHe rose and pensively opened a little box of vermeil with a lid of\naventurine.\n\nIt was filled with violet bonbons. He took one up and pressed it\nbetween his fingers, thinking of the strange properties of this\nsugary, frosted sweetmeat. When his virility had been impaired, when\nthe thought of woman had roused in him no sharp regret or desire, he\nhad only to put one in his mouth, let it melt, and almost at once it\ninduced misty, languishing memories, infinitely tender.\n\nThese bonbons invented by Siraudin and bearing the ridiculous name of\n\"Perles des Pyrenees\" were each a drop of sarcanthus perfume, a drop\nof feminine essence crystallized in a morsel of sugar. They penetrated\nthe papillae of the tongue, recalling the very savor of voluptuous\nkisses.\n\nUsually he smiled as he inhaled this love aroma, this shadow of a\ncaress which for a moment restored the delights of women he had once\nadored. Today they were not merely suggestive, they no longer served\nas a delicate hint of his distant riotous past. They were become\npowerful, thrusting aside the veils, exposing before his eyes the\nimportunate, corporeal and brutal reality.\n\nAt the head of the procession of mistresses whom the fragrance of the\nbonbons helped to place in bold relief, one paused, displaying long\nwhite teeth, a satiny rose skin, a snub nose, mouse-colored eyes, and\nclose-cropped blond hair.\n\nThis was Miss Urania, an American, with a vigorous body, sinewy limbs,\nmuscles of steel and arms of iron.\n\nShe had been one of the most celebrated acrobats of the Circus.\n\nDes Esseintes had watched her attentively through many long evenings.\nAt first, she had seemed to him what she really was, a strong and\nbeautiful woman, but the desire to know her never troubled him. She\npossessed nothing to recommend her in the eyes of a blase man, and yet\nhe returned to the Circus, allured by he knew not what, importuned by\na sentiment difficult to define.\n\nGradually, as he watched her, a fantastic idea seized him. Her\ngraceful antics and arch feminine ways receded to the background of\nhis mind, replaced by her power and strength which had for him all the\ncharm of masculinity. Compared with her, Des Esseintes seemed to\nhimself a frail, effeminate creature, and he began to desire her as\nardently as an anaemic young girl might desire some loutish Hercules\nwhose arms could crush her in a strong embrace.\n\nOne evening he finally decided to communicate with her and dispatched\none of the attendants on this errand. Miss Urania deemed it necessary\nnot to yield before a preliminary courtship; but she showed herself\namenable, as it was common gossip that Des Esseintes was rich and that\nhis name was instrumental in establishing women.\n\nBut as soon as his wishes were granted, his disappointment surpassed\nany he had yet experienced. He had persuaded himself that the American\nwoman would be as bestial and stupid as a wrestler at a county fair,\nand instead her stupidity was of an altogether feminine nature.\nCertainly, she lacked education and tact, had neither good sense nor\nwit, and displayed an animal voracity at table, but she possessed all\nthe childish traits of a woman. Her manner and speech were coquettish\nand affected, those of a silly, scandal-loving young girl. There was\nabsolutely nothing masculine about her.\n\nFurthermore, she was withdrawn and puritanical in her embraces,\ndisplaying none of the brute force he had dreaded yet longed for, and\nshe was subject to none of the perturbations of his sex.\n\nDes Esseintes inevitably returned to the masculine role he had\nmomentarily abandoned.\n\nHis impression of femininity, weakness, need of protection, of fear\neven, disappeared. The illusion was no longer possible! Miss Urania\nwas an ordinary mistress, in no wise justifying the cerebral curiosity\nshe had at first awakened in him.\n\nAlthough the charm of her firm skin and magnificent beauty had at\nfirst astonished and captivated Des Esseintes, he lost no time in\nterminating this liaison, for his impotence was prematurely hastened\nby the frozen and prudish caresses of this woman.\n\nAnd yet she was the first of all the women he had loved, now flitting\nthrough his revery, to stand out. But if she was more strongly\nimprinted on his memory than a host of others whose allurements had\nbeen less spurious and more seductive, the reason must be ascribed to\nher healthy animalism, to her exuberance which contrasted so\nstrikingly with the perfumed anaemia of the others, a faint suggestion\nof which he found in the delicate Siraudin bonbon.\n\nMiss Urania haunted him by reason of her very difference, but almost\ninstantly, offended by the intrusion of this natural, crude aroma, the\nantithesis of the scented confection, Des Esseintes returned to more\ncivilized exhalations and his thoughts reverted to his other\nmistresses. They pressed upon him in a throng; but above them all rose\na woman whose startling talents had satisfied him for months.\n\nShe was a little, slender brunette, with black eyes and burnished hair\nparted on one side and sleeked down over her head. He had known her in\na cafe where she gave ventriloqual performances.\n\nBefore the amazed patrons, she caused her tiny cardboard figures,\nplaced near each other on chairs, to talk; she conversed with the\nanimated mannikins while flies buzzed around the chandeliers. Then one\nheard the rustling of the tense audience, surprised to find itself\nseated and instinctively recoiling when they heard the rumbling of\nimaginary carriages.\n\nDes Esseintes had been fascinated. He lost no time in winning over the\nventriloquist, tempting her with large sums of money. She delighted\nhim by the very contrast she exhibited to the American woman. This\nbrunette used strong perfumes and burned like a crater. Despite all\nher blandishments, Des Esseintes wearied of her in a few short hours.\nBut this did not prevent him from letting himself be fleeced, for the\nphenomenon of the ventriloquist attracted him more than did the charms\nof the mistress.\n\nCertain plans he had long pondered upon ripened, and he decided to\nbring them to fruition.\n\nOne evening he ordered a tiny sphinx brought in--a sphinx carved from\nblack marble and resting in the classic pose with outstretched paws\nand erect head. He also purchased a chimera of polychrome clay; it\nbrandished its mane of hair, and its sides resembled a pair of\nbellows. These two images he placed in a corner of the room. Then he\nextinguished the lamps, permitting the glowing embers to throw a dim\nlight around the room and to magnify the objects which were almost\nimmersed in gloom.\n\nThen he stretched out on a couch beside the woman whose motionless\nfigure was touched by the ember gleams, and waited.\n\nWith strange intonations that he had long and patiently taught her,\nshe animated the two monsters; she did not even move her lips, she did\nnot even glance in their direction.\n\nAnd in the silence followed the marvelous dialogue of the Chimera and\nthe Sphinx; it was recited in deep guttural tones which were at first\nraucous, then turned shrill and unearthly.\n\n\"Here, Chimera, pause!\"\n\n\"Never!\"\n\nLulled by the admirable prose of Flaubert, he listened; he panted and\nshivering sensations raced through his frame, when the Chimera uttered\nthe magical and solemn phrase:\n\n\"New perfumes I seek, stranger flowers I seek, pleasures not yet\ndiscovered.\"\n\nAh! it was to him that this voice, mysterious as an incantation,\nspoke; it was to him that this voice recounted her feverish agitation\nfor the unknown, her insatiable ideals, her imperative need to escape\nfrom the horrible reality of existence, to leap beyond the confines of\nthought, to grope towards the mists of elusive, unattainable art. The\npoignant tragedy of his past failures rent his heart. Gently he\nclasped the silent woman at his side, he sought refuge in her\nnearness, like a child who is inconsolable; he was blind to the\nsulkiness of the comedienne obliged to perform off-scene, in her\nleisure moments, far from the spotlight.\n\nTheir liaison continued, but his spells of exhaustion soon became\nacute. His brain no longer sufficed to stimulate his benumbed body. No\nlonger did his nerves obey his will; and now the crazy whims of\ndotards dominated him. Terrified by the approach of a disastrous\nweakness in the presence of his mistress, he resorted to fear--that\noldest, most efficacious of excitants.\n\nA hoarse voice from behind the door would exclaim, while he held the\nwoman in his arms: \"Open the door, woman, I know you're in there, and\nwith whom. Just wait, wait!\" Instantly, like a libertine stirred by\nfear of discovery in the open, he recovered his strength and hurled\nhimself madly upon the ventriloquist whose voice continued to bluster\noutside the room. In this wise he experienced the pleasures of a\npanic-stricken person.\n\nBut this state, unfortunately, did not last long, and despite the sums\nhe paid her, the ventriloquist parted to offer herself to someone less\nexigent and less complex.\n\nHe had regretted her defection, and now, recalling her, the other\nwomen seemed insipid, their childish graces and monotonous coquetry\ndisgusting him.\n\nIn the ferment of his disordered brain, he delighted in mingling with\nthese recollections of his past, other more gloomy pleasures, as\ntheology qualifies the evocation of past, disgraceful acts. With the\nphysical visions he mingled spiritual ardors brought into play and\nmotivated by his old readings of the casuists, of the Busembaums and\nthe Dianas, of the Liguoris and the Sanchezes, treating of\ntransgressions against the sixth and ninth commandments of the\nDecalogue.\n\nIn awakening an almost divine ideal in this soul steeped in her\nprecepts--a soul possibly predisposed to the teachings of the Church\nthrough hereditary influences dating back from the reign of Henry III,\nreligion had also stirred the illegitimate, forbidden enjoyment of the\nsenses. Licentious and mystical obsessions haunted his brain, they\nmingled confusedly, and he would often be troubled by an unappeasable\ndesire to shun the vulgarities of the world and to plunge, far from\nthe customs and modes held in such reverence, into convulsions and\nraptures which were holy or infernal and which, in either case, proved\ntoo exhausting and enervating.\n\nHe would arise prostrate from such reveries, fatigued and all but\nlifeless. He would light the lamps and candles so as to flood the room\nwith light, for he hoped that by so doing he might possibly diminish\nthe intolerably persistent and dull throbbing of his arteries which\nbeat under his neck with redoubled strokes.\n\n\n\n\n    Chapter 10\n\n\nDuring the course of this malady which attacks impoverished races,\nsudden calms succeed an attack. Strangely enough, Des Esseintes awoke\none morning recovered; no longer was he tormented by the throbbing of\nhis neck or by his racking cough. Instead, he had an ineffable\nsensation of contentment, a lightness of mind in which thought was\nsparklingly clear, turning from a turbid, opaque, green color to a\nliquid iridescence magical with tender rainbow tints.\n\nThis lasted several days. Then hallucinations of odor suddenly\nappeared.\n\nHis room was aromatic with the fragrance of frangipane; he tried to\nascertain if a bottle were not uncorked--no! not a bottle was to be\nfound in the room, and he passed into his study and thence to the\nkitchen. Still the odor persisted.\n\nDes Esseintes rang for his servant and asked if he smelled anything.\nThe domestic sniffed the air and declared he could not detect any\nperfume. There was no doubt about it: his nervous attacks had returned\nagain, under the appearance of a new illusion of the senses.\n\nFatigued by the tenacity of this imaginary aroma, he resolved to steep\nhimself in real perfumes, hoping that this homeopathic treatment would\ncure him or would at least drown the persistent odor.\n\nHe betook himself to his dressing room. There, near an old baptistery\nwhich he used as a wash basin, under a long mirror of forged iron,\nwhich, like the edge of a well silvered by the moon, confined the\ngreen dull surface of the mirror, were bottles of every conceivable\nsize and form, placed on ivory shelves.\n\nHe set them on the table and divided them into two series: one of the\nsimple perfumes, pure extracts or spirits, the other of compound\nperfumes, designated under the generic term of bouquets.\n\nHe sank into an easy chair and meditated.\n\nHe had long been skilled in the science of smell. He believed that\nthis sense could give one delights equal to those of hearing and\nsight; each sense being susceptible, if naturally keen and if properly\ncultivated, to new impressions, which it could intensify, coordinate\nand compose into that unity which constitutes a creative work. And it\nwas not more abnormal and unnatural that an art should be called into\nexistence by disengaging odors than that another art should be evoked\nby detaching sound waves or by striking the eye with diversely colored\nrays. But if no person could discern, without intuition developed by\nstudy, a painting by a master from a daub, a melody of Beethoven from\none by Clapisson, no more could any one at first, without preliminary\ninitiation, help confusing a bouquet invented by a sincere artist with\na pot pourri made by some manufacturer to be sold in groceries and\nbazaars.\n\nIn this art, the branch devoted to achieving certain effects by\nartificial methods particularly delighted him.\n\nPerfumes, in fact, rarely come from the flowers whose names they bear.\nThe artist who dared to borrow nature's elements would only produce a\nbastard work which would have neither authenticity nor style, inasmuch\nas the essence obtained by the distillation of flowers would bear but\na distant and vulgar relation to the odor of the living flower,\nwafting its fragrance into the air.\n\nThus, with the exception of the inimitable jasmine which it is\nimpossible to counterfeit, all flowers are perfectly represented by\nthe blend of aromatic spirits, stealing the very personality of the\nmodel, and to it adding that nuance the more, that heady scent, that\nrare touch which entitled a thing to be called a work of art.\n\nTo resume, in the science of perfumery, the artist develops the\nnatural odor of the flowers, working over his subject like a jeweler\nrefining the lustre of a gem and making it precious.\n\nLittle by little, the arcana of this art, most neglected of all, was\nrevealed to Des Esseintes who could now read this language, as\ndiversified and insinuating as that of literature, this style with its\nunexpected concision under its vague flowing appearance.\n\nTo achieve this end he had first been compelled to master the grammar\nand understand the syntax of odors, learning the secret of the rules\nthat regulate them, and, once familiarized with the dialect, he\ncompared the works of the masters, of the Atkinsons and Lubins, the\nChardins and Violets, the Legrands and Piesses; then he separated the\nconstruction of their phrases, weighed the value of their words and\nthe arrangement of their periods.\n\nLater on, in this idiom of fluids, experience was able to support\ntheories too often incomplete and banal.\n\nClassic perfumery, in fact, was scarcely diversified, almost colorless\nand uniformly issuing from the mold cast by the ancient chemists. It\nwas in its dotage, confined to its old alambics, when the romantic\nperiod was born and had modified the old style, rejuvenating it,\nmaking it more supple and malleable.\n\nStep by step, its history followed that of our language. The perfumed\nLouis XIII style, composed of elements highly prized at that time, of\niris powder, musk, chive and myrtle water already designated under the\nname of \"water of the angels,\" was hardly sufficient to express the\ncavalier graces, the rather crude tones of the period which certain\nsonnets of Saint-Amand have preserved for us. Later, with myrrh and\nolibanum, the mystic odors, austere and powerful, the pompous gesture\nof the great period, the redundant artifices of oratorial art, the\nfull, sustained harmonious style of Bossuet and the masters of the\npulpit were almost possible. Still later, the sophisticated, rather\nbored graces of French society under Louis XV, more easily found their\ninterpretation in the almond which in a manner summed up this epoch;\nthen, after the ennui and jadedness of the first empire, which misused\nEau de Cologne and rosemary, perfumery rushed, in the wake of Victor\nHugo and Gautier, towards the Levant. It created oriental\ncombinations, vivid Eastern nosegays, discovered new intonations,\nantitheses which until then had been unattempted, selected and made\nuse of antique nuances which it complicated, refined and assorted. It\nresolutely rejected that voluntary decrepitude to which it had been\nreduced by the Malesherbes, the Boileaus, the Andrieuxes and the\nBaour-Lormians, wretched distillers of their own poems.\n\nBut this language had not remained stationery since the period of\n1830. It had continued to evolve and, patterning itself on the\nprogress of the century, had advanced parallel with the other arts.\nIt, too, had yielded to the desires of amateurs and artists, receiving\nits inspiration from the Chinese and Japanese, conceiving fragrant\nalbums, imitating the _Takeoka_ bouquets of flowers, obtaining the\nodor of _Rondeletia_ from the blend of lavender and clove; the\npeculiar aroma of Chinese ink from the marriage of patchouli and\ncamphor; the emanation of Japanese _Hovenia_ by compounds of citron,\nclove and neroli.\n\nDes Esseintes studied and analyzed the essences of these fluids,\nexperimenting to corroborate their texts. He took pleasure in playing\nthe role of a psychologist for his personal satisfaction, in taking\napart and re-assembling the machinery of a work, in separating the\npieces forming the structure of a compound exhalation, and his sense\nof smell had thereby attained a sureness that was all but perfect.\n\nJust as a wine merchant has only to smell a drop of wine to recognize\nthe grape, as a hop dealer determines the exact value of hops by\nsniffing a bag, as a Chinese trader can immediately tell the origin of\nthe teas he smells, knowing in what farms of what mountains, in what\nBuddhistic convents it was cultivated, the very time when its leaves\nwere gathered, the state and the degree of torrefaction, the effect\nupon it of its proximity to the plum-tree and other flowers, to all\nthose perfumes which change its essence, adding to it an unexpected\ntouch and introducing into its dryish flavor a hint of distant fresh\nflowers; just so could Des Esseintes, by inhaling a dash of perfume,\ninstantly explain its mixture and the psychology of its blend, and\ncould almost give the name of the artist who had composed and given it\nthe personal mark of his individual style.\n\nNaturally he had a collection of all the products used by perfumers.\nHe even had the real Mecca balm, that rare balm cultivated only in\ncertain parts of Arabia Petraea and under the monopoly of the ruler.\n\nNow, seated in his dressing room in front of his table, he thought of\ncreating a new bouquet; and he was overcome by that moment of wavering\nconfidence familiar to writers when, after months of inaction, they\nprepare for a new work.\n\nLike Balzac who was wont to scribble on many sheets of paper so as to\nput himself in a mood for work, Des Esseintes felt the necessity of\nsteadying his hand by several initial and unimportant experiments.\nDesiring to create heliotrope, he took down bottles of vanilla and\nalmond, then changed his idea and decided to experiment with sweet\npeas.\n\nHe groped for a long time, unable to effect the proper combinations,\nfor orange is dominant in the fragrance of this flower. He attempted\nseveral combinations and ended in achieving the exact blend by joining\ntuberose and rose to orange, the whole united by a drop of vanilla.\n\nHis hesitation disappeared. He felt alert and ready for work; now he\nmade some tea by blending cassie with iris, then, sure of his\ntechnique, he decided to proceed with a fulminating phrase whose\nthunderous roar would annihilate the insidious odor of almond still\nhovering over his room.\n\nHe worked with amber and with Tonkin musk, marvelously powerful; with\npatchouli, the most poignant of vegetable perfumes whose flower, in\nits habitat, wafts an odor of mildew. Try what he would, the\neighteenth century obsessed him; the panier robes and furbelows\nappeared before his eyes; memories of Boucher's _Venus_ haunted him;\nrecollections of Themidor's romance, of the exquisite Rosette pursued\nhim. Furious, he rose and to rid himself of the obsession, with all\nhis strength he inhaled that pure essence of spikenard, so dear to\nOrientals and so repulsive to Europeans because of its pronounced odor\nof valerian. He was stunned by the violence of the shock. As though\npounded by hammer strokes, the filigranes of the delicate odor\ndisappeared; he profited by the period of respite to escape the dead\ncenturies, the antiquated fumes, and to enter, as he formerly had\ndone, less limited or more recent works.\n\nHe had of old loved to lull himself with perfumes. He used effects\nanalogous to those of the poets, and employed the admirable order of\ncertain pieces of Baudelaire, such as _Irreparable_ and _le Balcon_,\nwhere the last of the five lines composing the strophe is the echo of\nthe first verse and returns, like a refrain, to steep the soul in\ninfinite depths of melancholy and languor.\n\nHe strayed into reveries evoked by those aromatic stanzas, suddenly\nbrought to his point of departure, to the motive of his meditation, by\nthe return of the initial theme, reappearing, at stated intervals, in\nthe fragrant orchestration of the poem.\n\nHe actually wished to saunter through an astonishing, diversified\nlandscape, and he began with a sonorous, ample phrase that suddenly\nopened a long vista of fields for him.\n\nWith his vaporizers, he injected an essence formed of ambrosia,\nlavender and sweet peas into this room; this formed an essence which,\nwhen distilled by an artist, deserves the name by which it is known:\n\"extract of wild grass\"; into this he introduced an exact blend of\ntuberose, orange flower and almond, and forthwith artificial lilacs\nsprang into being, while the linden-trees rustled, their thin\nemanations, imitated by extract of London tilia, drooping earthward.\n\nInto this _decor_, arranged with a few broad lines, receding as far as\nthe eye could reach, under his closed lids, he introduced a light rain\nof human and half feline essences, possessing the aroma of petticoats,\nbreathing of the powdered, painted woman, the stephanotis, ayapana,\nopopanax, champaka, sarcanthus and cypress wine, to which he added a\ndash of syringa, in order to give to the artificial life of paints\nwhich they exhaled, a suggestion of natural dewy laughter and\npleasures enjoyed in the open air.\n\nThen, through a ventilator, he permitted these fragrant waves to\nescape, only preserving the field which he renewed, compelling it to\nreturn in his strophes like a ritornello.\n\nThe women had gradually disappeared. Now the plain had grown solitary.\nSuddenly, on the enchanted horizon, factories appeared whose tall\nchimneys flared like bowls of punch.\n\nThe odor of factories and of chemical products now passed with the\nbreeze which was simulated by means of fans; nature exhaled its sweet\neffluvia amid this putrescence.\n\nDes Esseintes warmed a pellet of storax, and a singular odor, at once\nrepugnant and exquisite, pervaded the room. It partook of the\ndelicious fragrance of jonquil and of the stench of gutta percha and\ncoal oil. He disinfected his hands, inserted his resin in a\nhermetically sealed box, and the factories disappeared.\n\nThen, among the revived vapors of the lindens and meadow grass, he\nthrew several drops of new mown hay, and, amid this magic site for the\nmoment despoiled of its lilacs, sheaves of hay were piled up,\nintroducing a new season and scattering their fine effluence into\nthese summer odors.\n\nAt last, when he had sufficiently enjoyed this sight, he suddenly\nscattered the exotic perfumes, emptied his vaporizers, threw in his\nconcentrated spirits, poured his balms, and, in the exasperated and\nstifling heat of the room there rose a crazy sublimated nature, a\nparadoxical nature which was neither genuine nor charming, reuniting\nthe tropical spices and the peppery breath of Chinese sandal wood and\nJamaica hediosmia with the French odors of jasmine, hawthorn and\nverbena. Regardless of seasons and climates he forced trees of diverse\nessences into life, and flowers with conflicting fragrances and\ncolors. By the clash of these tones he created a general, nondescript,\nunexpected, strange perfume in which reappeared, like an obstinate\nrefrain, the decorative phrase of the beginning, the odor of the\nmeadows fanned by the lilacs and lindens.\n\nSuddenly a poignant pain seized him; he felt as though wimbles were\ndrilling into his temples. Opening his eyes he found himself in his\ndressing room, seated in front of his table. Stupefied, he painfully\nwalked across the room to the window which he half opened. A puff of\nwind dispelled the stifling atmosphere which was enveloping him. To\nexercise his limbs, he walked up and down gazing at the ceiling where\ncrabs and sea-wrack stood out in relief against a background as light\nin color as the sands of the seashore. A similar _decor_ covered the\nplinths and bordered the partitions which were covered with Japanese\nsea-green crepe, slightly wrinkled, imitating a river rippled by the\nwind. In this light current swam a rose petal, around which circled a\nschool of tiny fish painted with two strokes of the brush.\n\nBut his eyelids remained heavy. He ceased to pace about the short\nspace between the baptistery and the bath; he leaned against the\nwindow. His dizziness ended. He carefully stopped up the vials, and\nused the occasion to arrange his cosmetics. Since his arrival at\nFontenay he had not touched them; and now was quite astonished to\nbehold once more this collection formerly visited by so many women.\nThe flasks and jars were lying heaped up against each other. Here, a\nporcelain box contained a marvelous white cream which, when applied on\nthe cheeks, turns to a tender rose color, under the action of the\nair--to such a true flesh-color that it procures the very illusion of\na skin touched with blood; there, lacquer objects incrusted with\nmother of pearl enclosed Japanese gold and Athenian green, the color\nof the cantharis wing, gold and green which change to deep purple when\nwetted; there were jars filled with filbert paste, the serkis of the\nharem, emulsions of lilies, lotions of strawberry water and elders for\nthe complexion, and tiny bottles filled with solutions of Chinese ink\nand rose water for the eyes. There were tweezers, scissors, rouge and\npowder-puffs, files and beauty patches.\n\nHe handled this collection, formerly bought to please a mistress who\nswooned under the influence of certain aromatics and balms,--a\nnervous, unbalanced woman who loved to steep the nipples of her\nbreasts in perfumes, but who never really experienced a delicious and\noverwhelming ecstacy save when her head was scraped with a comb or\nwhen she could inhale, amid caresses, the odor of perspiration, or the\nplaster of unfinished houses on rainy days, or of dust splashed by\nhuge drops of rain during summer storms.\n\nHe mused over these memories, and one afternoon spent at Pantin\nthrough idleness and curiosity, in company with this woman at the home\nof one of her sisters, returned to him, stirring in him a forgotten\nworld of old ideas and perfumes; while the two women prattled and\ndisplayed their gowns, he had drawn near the window and had seen,\nthrough the dusty panes, the muddy street sprawling before him, and\nhad heard the repeated sounds of galoches over the puddles of the\npavement.\n\nThis scene, already far removed, came to him suddenly, strangely and\nvividly. Pantin was there before him, animated and throbbing in this\ngreenish and dull mirror into which his unseeing eyes plunged. A\nhallucination transported him far from Fontenay. Beside reflecting the\nstreet, the mirror brought back thoughts it had once been instrumental\nin evoking, and plunged in revery, he repeated to himself this\ningenious, sad and comforting composition he had formerly written upon\nreturning to Paris:\n\n\"Yes, the season of downpours is come. Now behold water-spouts\nvomiting as they rush over the pavements, and rubbish marinates in\npuddles that fill the holes scooped out of the macadam.\n\n\"Under a lowering sky, in the damp air, the walls of houses have black\nperspiration and their air-holes are fetid; the loathsomeness of\nexistence increases and melancholy overwhelms one; the seeds of\nvileness which each person harbors in his soul, sprout. The craving\nfor vile debaucheries seizes austere people and base desires grow\nrampant in the brains of respectable men.\n\n\"And yet I warm myself, here before a cheerful fire. From a basket of\nblossoming flowers comes the aroma of balsamic benzoin, geranium and\nthe whorl-flowered bent-grass which permeates the room. In the very\nmonth of November, at Pantin, in the rue de Paris, springtime\npersists. Here in my solitude I laugh at the fears of families which,\nto shun the approaching cold weather, escape on every steamer to\nCannes and to other winter resorts.\n\n\"Inclement nature does nothing to contribute to this extraordinary\nphenomenon. It must be said that his artificial season at Pantin is\nthe result of man's ingenuity.\n\n\"In fact, these flowers are made of taffeta and are mounted on wire.\nThe springtime odor filters through the window joints, exhaled from\nthe neighboring factories, from the perfumeries of Pinaud and Saint\nJames.\n\n\"For the workmen exhausted by the hard labors of the plants, for the\nyoung employes who too often are fathers, the illusion of a little\nhealthy air is possible, thanks to these manufacturers.\n\n\"So, from this fabulous subterfuge of a country can an intelligent\ncure arise. The consumptive men about town who are sent to the South\ndie, their end due to the change in their habits and to the nostalgia\nfor the Parisian excesses which destroyed them. Here, under an\nartificial climate, libertine memories will reappear, the languishing\nfeminine emanations evaporated by the factories. Instead of the deadly\nennui of provincial life, the doctor can thus platonically substitute\nfor his patient the atmosphere of the Parisian women and of boudoirs.\nMost often, all that is necessary to effect the cure is for the\nsubject to have a somewhat fertile imagination.\n\n\"Since, nowadays, nothing genuine exists, since the wine one drinks\nand the liberty one boldly proclaims are laughable and a sham, since\nit really needs a healthy dose of good will to believe that the\ngoverning classes are respectable and that the lower classes are\nworthy of being assisted or pitied, it seems to me,\" concluded Des\nEsseintes, \"to be neither ridiculous nor senseless, to ask of my\nfellow men a quantity of illusion barely equivalent to what they spend\ndaily in idiotic ends, so as to be able to convince themselves that\nthe town of Pantin is an artificial Nice or a Menton.\n\n\"But all this does not prevent me from seeing,\" he said, forced by\nweakness from his meditations, \"that I must be careful to mistrust\nthese delicious and abominable practices which may ruin my\nconstitution.\" He sighed. \"Well, well, more pleasures to moderate,\nmore precautions to be taken.\"\n\nAnd he passed into his study, hoping the more easily to escape the\nspell of these perfumes.\n\nHe opened the window wide, glad to be able to breath the air. But it\nsuddenly seemed to him that the breeze brought in a vague tide of\nbergamot with which jasmine and rose water were blent. Agitated, he\nasked himself whether he was not really under the yoke of one of those\npossessions exercised in the Middle Ages. The odor changed and was\ntransformed, but it persisted. A faint scent of tincture of tolu, of\nbalm of Peru and of saffron, united by several drams of amber and\nmusk, now issued from the sleeping village and suddenly, the\nmetamorphosis was effected, those scattered elements were blent, and\nonce more the frangipane spread from the valley of Fontenay as far as\nthe fort, assailing his exhausted nostrils, once more shattering his\nhelpless nerves and throwing him into such a prostration that he fell\nunconscious on the window sill.\n\n\n\n\n    Chapter 11\n\n\nThe servants were seized with alarm and lost no time in calling the\nFontenay physician who was completely at sea about Des Esseintes'\ncondition. He mumbled a few medical terms, felt his pulse, examined\nthe invalid's tongue, unsuccessfully sought to make him speak,\nprescribed sedatives and rest, promised to return on the morrow and,\nat the negative sign made by Des Esseintes who recovered enough\nstrength to chide the zeal of his servants and to bid farewell to this\nintruder, he departed and was soon retailing through the village the\neccentricities of this house whose decorations had positively amazed\nhim and held him rooted to the spot.\n\nTo the great astonishment of the domestics, who no longer dared stir\nfrom the servants' quarters, their master recovered in a few days, and\nthey surprised him drumming against the window panes, gazing at the\nsky with a troubled look.\n\nOne afternoon the bells were peremptorily rung and Des Esseintes\ncommanded his trunks to be packed for a long voyage.\n\nWhile the man and the woman were choosing, under his guidance, the\nnecessary equipment, he feverishly paced up and down the cabin of the\ndining room, consulted the timetables of the steamers, walked through\nhis study where he continued to gaze at the clouds with an air at once\nimpatient and satisfied.\n\nFor a whole week, the weather had been atrocious. Streams of soot\nraced unceasing across the grey fields of the sky-masses of clouds\nlike rocks torn from the earth.\n\nAt intervals, showers swept downward, engulfing the valley with\ntorrents of rain.\n\nToday, the appearance of the heavens had changed. The rivers of ink\nhad evaporated and vanished, and the harsh contours of the clouds had\nsoftened. The sky was uniformly flat and covered with a brackish film.\nLittle by little, this film seemed to drop, and a watery haze covered\nthe country side. The rain no longer fell in cataracts as on the\npreceding evening; instead, it fell incessantly, fine, sharp and\npenetrating; it inundated the walks, covered the roads with its\ninnumerable threads which joined heaven and earth. The livid sky threw\na wan leaden light on the village which was now transformed into a\nlake of mud pricked by needles of water that dotted the puddles with\ndrops of bright silver. In this desolation of nature, everything was\ngray, and only the housetops gleamed against the dead tones of the\nwalls.\n\n\"What weather!\" sighed the aged domestic, placing on a chair the\nclothes which his master had requested of him--an outfit formerly\nordered from London.\n\nDes Esseintes' sole response was to rub his hands and to sit down in\nfront of a book-case with glass doors. He examined the socks which had\nbeen placed nearby for his inspection. For a moment he hesitated on\nthe color; then he quickly studied the melancholy day and earnestly\nbethought himself of the effect he desired. He chose a pair the color\nof feuillemort, quickly slipped them on, put on a pair of buttoned\nshoes, donned the mouse grey suit which was checquered with a lava\ngray and dotted with black, placed a small hunting cap on his head and\nthrew a blue raincoat over him. He reached the railway station,\nfollowed by the servant who almost bent under the weight of a trunk, a\nvalise, a carpet bag, a hat box and a traveling rug containing\numbrellas and canes. He informed his servant that the date of his\nreturn was problematical, that he might return in a year, in a month,\nin a week, or even sooner, and enjoined him to change nothing in the\nhouse. He gave a sum of money which he thought would be necessary for\nthe upkeep of the house during his absence, and climbed into the\ncoach, leaving the old man astounded, arms waving and mouth gaping,\nbehind the rail, while the train got under way.\n\nHe was alone in his compartment; a vague and dirty country side, such\nas one sees through an aquarium of troubled water, receded rapidly\nbehind the train which was lashed by the rain. Plunged in his\nmeditations, Des Esseintes closed his eyes.\n\nOnce more, this so ardently desired and finally attained solitude had\nended in a fearful distress. This silence which formerly would have\nappeared as a compensation for the stupidities heard for years, now\nweighed on him with an unendurable burden. One morning he had\nawakened, as uneasy as a prisoner in his cell; his lips had sought to\narticulate sounds, tears had welled to his eyes and he had found it\nimpossible to breathe, suffocating like a person who had sobbed for\nhours.\n\nSeized with a desire to walk, to behold a human figure, to speak to\nsomeone, to mingle with life, he had proceeded to call his domestics,\nemploying a specious pretext; but conversation with them was\nimpossible. Besides the fact that these old people, bowed down by\nyears of silence and the customs of attendants, were almost dumb, the\ndistance at which Des Esseintes had always kept them was hardly\nconducive to inducing them to open their mouths now. Too, they\npossessed dull brains and were incapable of answering his questions\nother than by monosyllables.\n\nIt was impossible, therefore, to find any solace in their society; but\na new phenomenon now occurred. The reading of the novels of Dickens,\nwhich he had lately undertaken to soothe his nerves and which had only\nproduced effects the opposite of those hoped for, began slowly to act\nin an unexpected manner, bringing on visions of English existence on\nwhich he mused for hours; little by little, in these fictive\ncontemplations, ideas insinuated themselves, ideas of the voyage\nbrought to an end, of verified dreams on which was imposed the desire\nto experience new impressions, and thus escape the exhausting cerebral\ndebauches intent upon beating in the void.\n\nWith its mist and rain, this abominable weather aided his thoughts\nstill more, by reinforcing the memories of his readings, by placing\nunder his eyes the unfading image of a land of fog and mud, and by\nrefusing to let his ideas wander idly.\n\nOne day, able to endure it no longer, he had instantly decided. Such\nwas his haste that he even took flight before the designated time, for\nhe wished to shun the present moment, wished to find himself jostled\nand shouldered in the hubbub of crowded streets and railway stations.\n\n\"I breathe!\" he exclaimed when the train moderated its waltz and\nstopped in the Sceaux station rotunda, panting while its wheels\nperformed its last pirouettes.\n\nOnce in the boulevard d'Enfer, he hailed a coachman. In some strange\nmanner he extracted a pleasure from the fact that he was so hampered\nwith trunks and rugs. By promising a substantial tip, he reached an\nunderstanding with the man of the brown trousers and red waistcoat.\n\n\"At once!\" he commanded. \"And when you reach the rue de Rivoli, stop\nin front of _Galignani's Messenger_.\" Before departing, he desired to\nbuy a Baedeker or Murray guide of London.\n\nThe carriage got under way heavily, raising rings of mud around its\nwheels and moving through marsh-like ground. Beneath the gray sky\nwhich seemed suspended over the house tops, water gushed down the\nthick sides of the high walls, spouts overflowed, and the streets were\ncoated with a slimy dirt in which passersby slipped. Thickset men\npaused on sidewalks bespattered by passing omnibuses, and women, their\nskirts tucked up to the knees, bent under umbrellas, flattened\nthemselves against the shops to avoid being splashed.\n\nThe rain entered diagonally through the carriage doors. Des Esseintes\nwas obliged to lift the carriage windows down which the water ran,\nwhile drops of mud furrowed their way like fireworks on each side of\nthe _fiacre_. To the monotonous sound of sacks of peas shaking against\nhis head through the action of the showers pattering against the\ntrunks and on the carriage rug, Des Esseintes dreamed of his voyage.\nThis already was a partial realization of his England, enjoyed in\nParis through the means of this frightful weather: a rainy, colossal\nLondon smelling of molten metal and of soot, ceaselessly steaming and\nsmoking in the fog now spread out before his eyes; then rows of docks\nsprawled ahead, as far as the eye could reach, docks full of cranes,\nhand winches and bales, swarming with men perched on masts or astride\nyard sails, while myriads of other men on the quays pushed hogsheads\ninto cellars.\n\nAll this was transpiring in vast warehouses along the river banks\nwhich were bathed by the muddy and dull water of an imaginary Thames,\nin a forest of masts and girders piercing the wan clouds of the\nfirmament, while trains rushed past at full speed or rumpled\nunderground uttering horrible cries and vomiting waves of smoke, and\nwhile, through every street, monstrous and gaudy and infamous\nadvertisements flared through the eternal twilight, and strings of\ncarriages passed between rows of preoccupied and taciturn people whose\neyes stared ahead and whose elbows pressed closely against their\nbodies.\n\nDes Esseintes shivered deliciously to feel himself mingling in this\nterrible world of merchants, in this insulating mist, in this\nincessant activity, in this pitiless gearing which ground millions of\nthe disinherited, urged by the comfort-distilling philanthropists to\nrecite Biblical verses and to sing psalms.\n\nThen the vision faded suddenly with a jolt of the _fiacre_ which made\nhim rebound in his seat. He gazed through the carriage windows. Night\nhad fallen; gas burners blinked through the fog, amid a yellowish\nhalo; ribbons of fire swam in puddles of water and seemed to revolve\naround wheels of carriages moving through liquid and dirty flame. He\nendeavored to get his bearings, perceived the Carrousel and suddenly,\nunreasoningly, perhaps through the simple effect of the high fall from\nfanciful spaces, his thought reverted to a very trivial incident. He\nremembered that his domestic had neglected to put a tooth brush in his\nbelongings. Then, he passed in review the list of objects packed up;\neverything had been placed in his valise, but the annoyance of having\nomitted this brush persisted until the driver, pulling up, broke the\nchain of his reminiscences and regrets.\n\nHe was in the rue de Rivoli, in front of _Galignani's Messenger_.\nSeparated by a door whose unpolished glass was covered with\ninscriptions and with strips of passe-partout framing newspaper\nclippings and telegrams, were two vast shop windows crammed with\nalbums and books. He drew near, attracted by the sight of these books\nbound in parrot-blue and cabbage-green paper, embossed with silver and\ngolden letterings. All this had an anti-Parisian touch, a mercantile\nappearance, more brutal and yet less wretched than those worthless\nbindings of French books; here and there, in the midst of the opened\nalbums, reproducing humorous scenes from Du Maurier and John Leech, or\nthe delirious cavalcades of Caldecott, some French novels appeared,\nblending placid and satisfied vulgarities to these rich verjuice hues.\nHe tore himself away from his contemplation, opened the door and\nentered a large library which was full of people. Seated strangers\nunfolded maps and jabbered in strange languages. A clerk brought him a\ncomplete collection of guides. He, in turns, sat down to examine the\nbooks with their flexible covers. He glanced through them and paused\nat a page of the Baedeker describing the London museums. He became\ninterested in the laconic and exact details of the guide books, but\nhis attention wandered away from the old English paintings to the\nmoderns which attracted him much more. He recalled certain works he\nhad seen at international expositions, and imagined that he might\npossibly behold them once more at London: pictures by Millais--the\n_Eve of Saint Agnes_ with its lunar clear green; pictures by Watts,\nstrange in color, checquered with gamboge and indigo, pictures\nsketched by a sick Gustave Moreau, painted by an anaemic Michael\nAngelo and retouched by a Raphael submerged in blue. Among other\ncanvasses, he recalled a _Denunciation of Cain_, an _Ida_, some _Eves_\nwhere, in the strange and mysterious mixture of these three masters,\nrose the personality, at once refined and crude, of a learned and\ndreamy Englishman tormented by the bewitchment of cruel tones.\n\nThese canvasses thronged through his memory. The clerk, astonished by\nthis client who was so lost to the world, asked him which of the\nguides he would take. Des Esseintes remained dumbfounded, then excused\nhimself, bought a Baedeker and departed. The dampness froze him to the\nspot; the wind blew from the side, lashing the arcades with whips of\nrain. \"Proceed to that place,\" he said to the driver, pointing with\nhis finger to the end of a passage where a store formed the angle of\nthe rue de Rivoli and the rue Castiglione and, with its whitish panes\nof glass illumed from within, resembled a vast night lamp burning\nthrough the wretchedness of this mist, in the misery of this crazy\nweather.\n\nIt was the _Bodega_. Des Esseintes strayed into a large room sustained\nby iron pillars and lined, on each side of its walls, with tall\nbarrels placed on their ends upon gantries, hooped with iron, their\npaunches with wooden loopholes imitating a rack of pipes and from\nwhose notches hung tulip-shaped glasses, upside down. The lower sides\nwere bored and hafted with stone cocks. These hogsheads painted with a\nroyal coat of arms displayed the names of their drinks, the contents,\nand the prices on colored labels and stated that they were to be\npurchased by the cask, by the bottle or by the glass.\n\nIn the passage between these rows of casks, under the gas jets which\nflared at one end of an ugly iron-gray chandelier, tables covered with\nbaskets of Palmers biscuits, hard and salty cakes, plates piled with\nmince pies and sandwiches concealing strong, mustardy concoctions\nunder their unsavory covers, succeeded each other between a row of\nseats and as far as the end of this cellar which was lined with still\nmore hogsheads carrying tiny barrels on their tops, resting on their\nsides and bearing their names stamped with hot metal into the oak.\n\nAn odor of alcohol assailed Des Esseintes upon taking a seat in this\nroom heavy with strong wines. He looked about him. Here, the tuns were\nplaced in a straight line, exhibiting the whole series of ports, the\nsweet or sour wines the color of mahogany or amaranth, and\ndistinguished by such laudatory epithets as _old port_, _light\ndelicate_, _Cockburn's very fine_, _magnificent old Regina_. There,\nprotruding formidable abdomens pressed closely against each other,\nhuge casks contained the martial Spanish wines, sherry and its\nderivatives, the _san lucar_, _pasto_, _pale dry_, _oloroso_ and\n_amontilla_.\n\nThe cellar was filled with people. Leaning on his elbows on a corner\nof the table, Des Esseintes sat waiting for his glass of port ordered\nof a gentleman who was opening explosive sodas contained in oval\nbottles which recalled, while exaggerating, the capsules of gelatine\nand gluten used by pharmacies to conceal the taste of certain\nmedicines.\n\nEnglishmen were everywhere,--awkward pale clergymen garbed in black\nfrom head to foot, with soft hats, laced shoes, very long coats dotted\nin the front with tiny buttons, clean-shaved chins, round spectacles,\ngreasy flat hair; faces of tripe dealers and mastiff snouts with\napoplectic necks, ears like tomatoes, vinous cheeks, blood-shot crazy\neyes, whiskers that looked like those of some big monkeys; farther\naway, at the end of the wine store, a long row of tow-headed\nindividuals, their chins covered with white hair like the end of an\nartichoke, reading, through a microscope, the tiny roman type of an\nEnglish newspaper; opposite him, a sort of American commodore, dumpy\nand thick-set, with smoked skin and bulbous nose, was sleeping, a\ncigar planted in the hairy aperture of his mouth. Opposite were frames\nhanging on the wall enclosing advertisements of Champagne, the trade\nmarks of Perrier and Roederer, Heidsieck and Mumm, and a hooded head\nof a monk, with the name of Dom Perignon, Rheims, written in Gothic\ncharacters.\n\nA certain enervation enveloped Des Esseintes in this guard house\natmosphere; stunned by the prattle of the Englishmen conversing among\nthemselves, he fell into a revery, evoking, before the purple port\nwhich filled the glasses, the creatures of Dickens that love this\ndrink so very much, imaginatively peopling the cellar with new\npersonages, seeing here, the white head of hair and the ruddy\ncomplexion of Mr. Wickfield; there, the phlegmatic, crafty face and\nthe vengeful eye of Mr. Tulkinghorn, the melancholy solicitor in\n_Bleak House_. Positively, all of them broke away from his memory and\ninstalled themselves in the _Bodega_, with their peculiar\ncharacteristics and their betraying gestures. His memories, brought to\nlife by his recent readings, attained a startling precision. The city\nof the romancer, the house illumined and warmed, so perfectly tended\nand isolated, the bottles poured slowly by little Dorrit and Dora\nCopperfield and Tom Pinch's sister, appeared to him sailing like an\nark in a deluge of mire and soot. Idly he wandered through this\nimaginary London, happy to be sheltered, as he listened to the\nsinister shrieks of tugs plying up and down the Thames. His glass was\nempty. Despite the heavy fumes in this cellar, caused by the cigars\nand pipes, he experienced a cold shiver when he returned to the\nreality of the damp and fetid weather.\n\nHe called for a glass of amontillado, and suddenly, beside this pale,\ndry wine, the lenitive, sweetish stories of the English author were\nrouted, to be replaced by the pitiless revulsives and the grievous\nirritants of Edgar Allen Poe; the cold nightmares of _The Cask of\nAmontillado_, of the man immured in a vault, assailed him; the\nordinary placid faces of American and English drinkers who occupied\nthe room, appeared to him to reflect involuntary frightful thoughts,\nto be harboring instinctive, odious plots. Then he perceived that he\nwas left alone here and that the dinner hour was near. He payed his\nbill, tore himself from his seat and dizzily gained the door. He\nreceived a wet slap in the face upon leaving the place. The street\nlamps moved their tiny fans of flame which failed to illuminate; the\nsky had dropped to the very houses. Des Esseintes viewed the arcades\nof the rue de Rivoli, drowned in the gloom and submerged by water, and\nit seemed to him that he was in the gloomy tunnel under the Thames.\nTwitchings of his stomach recalled him to reality. He regained his\ncarriage, gave the driver the address of the tavern in the rue\nd'Amsterdam near the station, and looked at his watch: seven o'clock.\nHe had just time to eat dinner; the train would not leave until ten\nminutes of nine, and he counted on his fingers, reckoning the hours of\ntravel from Dieppe to Newhaven, saying to himself: \"If the figures of\nthe timetable are correct, I shall be at London tomorrow at\ntwelve-thirty.\"\n\nThe _fiacre_ stopped in front of the tavern. Once more, Des Esseintes\nalighted and entered a long dark plain room, divided into partitions\nas high as a man's waist,--a series of compartments resembling stalls.\nIn this room, wider towards the door, many beer pumps stood on a\ncounter, near hams having the color of old violins, red lobsters,\nmarinated mackerel, with onions and carrots, slices of lemon, bunches\nof laurel and thym, juniper berries and long peppers swimming in thick\nsauce.\n\nOne of these boxes was unoccupied. He took it and called a young\nblack-suited man who bent forward, muttering something in a jargon he\ncould not understand. While the cloth was being laid, Des Esseintes\nviewed his neighbors. They were islanders, just as at the _Bodega_,\nwith cold faience eyes, crimson complexions, thoughtful or haughty\nairs. They were reading foreign newspapers. The only ones eating were\nunescorted women in pairs, robust English women with boyish faces,\nlarge teeth, ruddy apple cheeks, long hands and legs. They attacked,\nwith genuine ardor, a rumpsteak pie, a warm meat dish cooked in\nmushroom sauce and covered with a crust, like a pie.\n\nAfter having lacked appetite for such a long time, he remained amazed\nin the presence of these hearty eaters whose voracity whetted his\nhunger. He ordered oxtail soup and enjoyed it heartily. Then he\nglanced at the menu for the fish, ordered a haddock and, seized with a\nsudden pang of hunger at the sight of so many people relishing their\nfood, he ate some roast beef and drank two pints of ale, stimulated by\nthe flavor of a cow-shed which this fine, pale beer exhaled.\n\nHis hunger persisted. He lingered over a piece of blue Stilton cheese,\nmade quick work of a rhubarb tart, and to vary his drinking, quenched\nhis thirst with porter, that dark beer which smells of Spanish\nlicorice but which does not have its sugary taste.\n\nHe breathed deeply. Not for years had he eaten and drunk so much. This\nchange of habit, this choice of unexpected and solid food had awakened\nhis stomach from its long sleep. He leaned back in his chair, lit a\ncigarette and prepared to sip his coffee into which gin had been\npoured.\n\nThe rain continued to fall. He heard it patter on the panes which\nformed a ceiling at the end of the room; it fell in cascades down the\nspouts. No one was stirring in the room. Everybody, utterly weary, was\nindulging himself in front of his wine glass.\n\nTongues were now wagging freely. As almost all the English men and\nwomen raised their eyes as they spoke, Des Esseintes concluded that\nthey were talking of the bad weather; not one of them laughed. He\nthrew a delighted glance on their suits whose color and cut did not\nperceivably differ from that of others, and he experienced a sense of\ncontentment in not being out of tune in this environment, of being, in\nsome way, though superficially, a naturalized London citizen. Then he\nsuddenly started. \"And what about the train?\" he asked himself. He\nglanced at his watch: ten minutes to eight. \"I still have nearly a\nhalf-hour to remain here.\" Once more, he began to muse upon the plan\nhe had conceived.\n\nIn his sedentary life, only two countries had ever attracted him:\nHolland and England.\n\nHe had satisfied the first of his desires. Unable to keep away, one\nfine day he had left Paris and visited the towns of the Low Lands, one\nby one.\n\nIn short, nothing but cruel disillusions had resulted from this trip.\nHe had fancied a Holland after the works of Teniers and Steen, of\nRembrandt and Ostade, in his usual way imagining rich, unique and\nincomparable Ghettos, had thought of amazing kermesses, continual\ndebauches in the country sides, intent for a view of that patriarchal\nsimplicity, that jovial lusty spirit celebrated by the old masters.\n\nCertainly, Haarlem and Amsterdam had enraptured him. The unwashed\npeople, seen in their country farms, really resembled those types\npainted by Van Ostade, with their uncouth children and their old fat\nwomen, embossed with huge breasts and enormous bellies. But of the\nunrestrained joys, the drunken family carousals, not a whit. He had to\nadmit that the Dutch paintings at the Louvre had misled him. They had\nsimply served as a springing board for his dreams. He had rushed\nforward on a false track and had wandered into capricious visions,\nunable to discover in the land itself, anything of that real and\nmagical country which he had hoped to behold, seeing nothing at all,\non the plots of ground strewn with barrels, of the dances of\npetticoated and stockinged peasants crying for very joy, stamping\ntheir feet out of sheer happiness and laughing loudly.\n\nDecidedly nothing of all this was visible. Holland was a country just\nlike any other country, and what was more, a country in no wise\nprimitive, not at all simple, for the Protestant religion with its\nformal hypocricies and solemn rigidness held sway here.\n\nThe memory of that disenchantment returned to him. Once more he\nglanced at his watch: ten minutes still separated him from the train's\ndeparture. \"It is about time to ask for the bill and leave,\" he told\nhimself.\n\nHe felt an extreme heaviness in his stomach and through his body.\n\"Come!\" he addressed himself, \"let us drink and screw up our courage.\"\nHe filled a glass of brandy, while asking for the reckoning. An\nindividual in black suit and with a napkin under one arm, a sort of\nmajordomo with a bald and sharp head, a greying beard without\nmoustaches, came forward. A pencil rested behind his ear and he\nassumed an attitude like a singer, one foot in front of the other; he\ndrew a note book from his pocket, and without glancing at his paper,\nhis eyes fixed on the ceiling, near a chandelier, wrote while\ncounting. \"There you are!\" he said, tearing the sheet from his note\nbook and giving it to Des Esseintes who looked at him with curiosity,\nas though he were a rare animal. What a surprising John Bull, he\nthought, contemplating this phlegmatic person who had, because of his\nshaved mouth, the appearance of a wheelsman of an American ship.\n\nAt this moment, the tavern door opened. Several persons entered\nbringing with them an odor of wet dog to which was blent the smell of\ncoal wafted by the wind through the opened door. Des Esseintes was\nincapable of moving a limb. A soft warm languor prevented him from\neven stretching out his hand to light a cigar. He told himself: \"Come\nnow, let us get up, we must take ourselves off.\" Immediate objections\nthwarted his orders. What is the use of moving, when one can travel on\na chair so magnificently? Was he not even now in London, whose aromas\nand atmosphere and inhabitants, whose food and utensils surrounded\nhim? For what could he hope, if not new disillusionments, as had\nhappened to him in Holland?\n\nHe had but sufficient time to race to the station. An overwhelming\naversion for the trip, an imperious need of remaining tranquil, seized\nhim with a more and more obvious and stubborn strength. Pensively, he\nlet the minutes pass, thus cutting off all retreat, and he said to\nhimself, \"Now it would be necessary to rush to the gate and crowd into\nthe baggage room! What ennui! What a bore that would be!\" Then he\nrepeated to himself once more, \"In fine, I have experienced and seen\nall I wished to experience and see. I have been filled with English\nlife since my departure. I would be mad indeed to go and, by an\nawkward trip, lose those imperishable sensations. How stupid of me to\nhave sought to disown my old ideas, to have doubted the efficacy of\nthe docile phantasmagories of my brain, like a very fool to have\nthought of the necessity, of the curiosity, of the interest of an\nexcursion!\"\n\n\"Well!\" he exclaimed, consulting his watch, \"it is now time to return\nhome.\"\n\nThis time, he arose and left, ordered the driver to bring him back to\nthe Sceaux station, and returned with his trunks, packages, valises,\nrugs, umbrellas and canes, to Fontenay, feeling the physical\nstimulation and the moral fatigue of a man coming back to his home\nafter a long and dangerous voyage.\n\n\n\n\n    Chapter 12\n\n\nDuring the days following his return, Des Esseintes contemplated his\nbooks and experienced, at the thought that he might have been\nseparated from them for a long period, a satisfaction as complete as\nthat which comes after a protracted absence. Under the touch of this\nsentiment, these objects possessed a renewed novelty to his mind, and\nhe perceived in them beauties forgotten since the time he had\npurchased them.\n\nEverything there, books, bric-a-brac and furniture, had an individual\ncharm for him. His bed seemed the softer by comparison with the hard\nbed he would have occupied in London. The silent, discreet\nministrations of his servants charmed him, exhausted as he was at the\nthought of the loud loquacity of hotel attendants. The methodical\norganization of his life made him feel that it was especially to be\nenvied since the possibility of traveling had become imminent.\n\nHe steeped himself in this bath of habitude, to which artificial\nregrets insinuated a tonic quality.\n\nBut his books chiefly preoccupied him. He examined them, re-arranged\nthem on the shelves, anxious to learn if the hot weather and the rains\nhad damaged the bindings and injured the rare paper.\n\nHe began by moving all his Latin books; then he arranged in a new\norder the special works of Archelaus, Albert le Grand, Lully and\nArnaud de Villanova treating of cabbala and the occult sciences;\nfinally he examined his modern books, one by one, and was happy to\nperceive that all had remained intact.\n\nThis collection had cost him a considerable sum of money. He would not\nsuffer, in his library, the books he loved to resemble other similar\nvolumes, printed on cotton paper with the watermarks of _Auvergne_.\n\nFormerly in Paris he had ordered made, for himself alone, certain\nvolumes which specially engaged mechanics printed from hand presses.\nSometimes, he applied to Perrin of Lyons, whose graceful, clear type\nwas suitable for archaic reprints of old books. At other times he\ndispatched orders to England or to America for the execution of modern\nliterature and the works of the present century. Still again, he\napplied to a house in Lille, which for centuries had possessed a\ncomplete set of Gothic characters; he also would send requisitions to\nthe old Enschede printing house of Haarlem whose foundry still has the\nstamps and dies of certain antique letters.\n\nHe had followed the same method in selecting his papers. Finally\ngrowing weary of the snowy Chinese and the nacreous and gilded\nJapanese papers, the white Whatmans, the brown Hollands, the\nbuff-colored Turkeys and Seychal Mills, and equally disgusted with all\nmechanically manufactured sheets, he had ordered special laid paper in\nthe mould, from the old plants of Vire which still employ the pestles\nonce in use to grind hemp. To introduce a certain variety into his\ncollection, he had repeatedly brought from London prepared stuffs,\npaper interwoven with hairs, and as a mark of his disdain for\nbibliophiles, he had a Lubeck merchant prepare for him an improved\ncandle paper of bottle-blue tint, clear and somewhat brittle, in the\npulp of which the straw was replaced by golden spangles resembling\nthose which dot Danzig brandy.\n\nUnder these circumstances he had succeeded in procuring unique books,\nadopting obsolete formats which he had bound by Lortic, by\nTrautz-Bauzonnet or Chambolle, by the successors of Cape, in\nirreproachable covers of old silk, stamped cow hide, Cape goat skin,\nin full bindings with compartments and in mosaic designs, protected by\ntabby or moire watered silk, ecclesiastically ornamented with clasps\nand corners, and sometimes even enamelled by Gruel Engelmann with\nsilver oxide and clear enamels.\n\nThus, with the marvelous episcopal lettering used in the old house of\nLe Clere, he had Baudelaire's works printed in a large format\nrecalling that of ancient missals, on a very light and spongy Japan\npaper, soft as elder pith and imperceptibly tinted with a light rose\nhue through its milky white. This edition, limited to one copy,\nprinted with a velvety black Chinese ink, had been covered outside and\nthen recovered within with a wonderful genuine sow skin, chosen among\na thousand, the color of flesh, its surface spotted where the hairs\nhad been and adorned with black silk stamped in cold iron in\nmiraculous designs by a great artist.\n\nThat day, Des Esseintes took this incomparable book from his shelves\nand handled it devotedly, once more reading certain pieces which\nseemed to him, in this simple but inestimable frame, more than\nordinarily penetrating.\n\nHis admiration for this writer was unqualified. According to him,\nuntil Baudelaire's advent in literature, writers had limited\nthemselves to exploring the surfaces of the soul or to penetrating\ninto the accessible and illuminated caverns, restoring here and there\nthe layers of capital sins, studying their veins, their growths, and\nnoting, like Balzac for example, the layers of strata in the soul\npossessed by the monomania of a passion, by ambition, by avarice, by\npaternal stupidity, or by senile love.\n\nWhat had been treated heretofore was the abundant health of virtues\nand of vices, the tranquil functioning of commonplace brains, and the\npractical reality of contemporary ideas, without any ideal of sickly\ndepravation or of any beyond. In short, the discoveries of those\nanalysts had stopped at the speculations of good or evil classified by\nthe Church. It was the simple investigation, the conventional\nexamination of a botanist minutely observing the anticipated\ndevelopment of normal efflorescence abounding in the natural earth.\n\nBaudelaire had gone farther. He had descended to the very bowels of\nthe inexhaustible mine, had involved his mind in abandoned and\nunfamiliar levels, and come to those districts of the soul where\nmonstrous vegetations of thought extend their branches.\n\nThere, near those confines, the haunt of aberrations and of sickness,\nof the mystic lockjaw, the warm fever of lust, and the typhoids and\nvomits of crime, he had found, brooding under the gloomy clock of\nEnnui, the terrifying spectre of the age of sentiments and ideas.\n\nHe had revealed the morbid psychology of the mind which has attained\nthe October of its sensations, recounted the symptoms of souls\nsummoned by grief and licensed by spleen, and shown the increasing\ndecay of impressions while the enthusiasms and beliefs of youth are\nenfeebled and the only thing remaining is the arid memory of miseries\nborne, intolerances endured and affronts suffered by intelligences\noppressed by a ridiculous destiny.\n\nHe had pursued all the phases of that lamentable autumn, studying the\nhuman creature, quick to exasperation, ingenious in deceiving himself,\ncompelling his thoughts to cheat each other so as to suffer the more\nkeenly, and frustrating in advance all possible joy by his faculty of\nanalysis and observation.\n\nThen, in this vexed sensibility of the soul, in this ferocity of\nreflection that repels the restless ardor of devotions and the\nwell-meaning outrages of charity, he gradually saw arising the horror\nof those senile passions, those ripe loves, where one person yields\nwhile the other is still suspicious, where lassitude denies such\ncouples the filial caresses whose apparent youthfulness seems new, and\nthe maternal candors whose gentleness and comfort impart, in a sense,\nthe engaging remorse of a vague incest.\n\nIn magnificent pages he exposed his hybrid loves who were exasperated\nby the impotence in which they were overwhelmed, the hazardous deceits\nof narcotics and poisons invoked to aid in calming suffering and\nconquering ennui. At an epoch when literature attributed unhappiness\nof life almost exclusively to the mischances of unrequited love or to\nthe jealousies that attend adulterous love, he disregarded such\npuerile maladies and probed into those wounds which are more fatal,\nmore keen and deep, which arise from satiety, disillusion and scorn in\nruined souls whom the present tortures, the past fills with loathing\nand the future frightens and menaces with despair.\n\nAnd the more Des Esseintes read Baudelaire, the more he felt the\nineffable charm of this writer who, in an age when verse served only\nto portray the external semblance of beings and things, had succeeded\nin expressing the inexpressible in a muscular and brawny language;\nwho, more than any other writer possessed a marvelous power to define\nwith a strange robustness of expression, the most fugitive and\ntentative morbidities of exhausted minds and sad souls.\n\nAfter Baudelaire's works, the number of French books given place in\nhis shelves was strictly limited. He was completely indifferent to\nthose works which it is fashionable to praise. \"The broad laugh of\nRabelais,\" and \"the deep comedy of Moliere,\" did not succeed in\ndiverting him, and the antipathy he felt against these farces was so\ngreat that he did not hesitate to liken them, in the point of art, to\nthe capers of circus clowns.\n\nAs for old poetry, he read hardly anything except Villon, whose\nmelancholy ballads touched him, and, here and there, certain fragments\nfrom d'Aubigne, which stimulated his blood with the incredible\nvehemence of their apostrophes and curses.\n\nIn prose, he cared little for Voltaire and Rousseau, and was unmoved\neven by Diderot, whose so greatly praised _Salons_ he found strangely\nsaturated with moralizing twaddle and futility; in his hatred toward\nall this balderdash, he limited himself almost exclusively to the\nreading of Christian eloquence, to the books of Bourdaloue and Bossuet\nwhose sonorously embellished periods were imposing; but, still more,\nhe relished suggestive ideas condensed into severe and strong phrases,\nsuch as those created by Nicole in his reflections, and especially\nPascal, whose austere pessimism and attrition deeply touched him.\n\nApart from such books as these, French literature began in his library\nwith the nineteenth century.\n\nThis section was divided into two groups, one of which included the\nordinary, secular literature, and the other the Catholic literature, a\nspecial but little known literature published by large publishing\nhouses and circulated to the four corners of the earth.\n\nHe had had the hardihood to explore such crypts as these, just as in\nthe secular art he had discovered, under an enormous mass of insipid\nwritings, a few books written by true masters.\n\nThe distinctive character of this literature was the constant\nimmutability of its ideas and language. Just as the Church perpetuated\nthe primitive form of holy objects, so she has preserved the relics of\nher dogmas, piously retaining, as the frame that encloses them, the\noratorical language of the celebrated century. As one of the Church's\nown writers, Ozanam, has put it, the Christian style needed only to\nmake use of the dialect employed by Bourdaloue and by Bossuet to the\nexclusion of all else.\n\nIn spite of this statement, the Church, more indulgent, closed its\neyes to certain expressions, certain turns of style borrowed from the\nsecular language of the same century, and the Catholic idiom had\nslightly purified itself of its heavy and massive phrases, especially\ncleaning itself, in Bossuet, of its prolixity and the painful rallying\nof its pronouns; but here ended the concessions, and others would\ndoubtless have been purposeless for the prose sufficed without this\nballast for the limited range of subjects to which the Church confined\nitself.\n\nIncapable of grappling with contemporary life, of rendering the most\nsimple aspects of things and persons visible and palpable, unqualified\nto explain the complicated wiles of intellects indifferent to the\nbenefits of salvation, this language was nevertheless excellent when\nit treated of abstract subjects. It proved valuable in the argument of\ncontroversy, in the demonstration of a theory, in the obscurity of a\ncommentary and, more than any other style, had the necessary authority\nto affirm, without any discussion, the intent of a doctrine.\n\nUnfortunately, here as everywhere, the sanctuary had been invaded by a\nnumerous army of pedants who smirched by their ignorance and lack of\ntalent the Church's noble and austere attire. Further to profane it,\ndevout women had interfered, and stupid sacristans and foolish\n_salons_ had acclaimed as works of genius the wretched prattle of such\nwomen.\n\nAmong such works, Des Esseintes had had the curiosity to read those of\nMadame Swetchine, the Russian, whose house in Paris was the rendezvous\nof the most fervent Catholics. Her writings had filled him with\ninsufferably horrible boredom; they were more than merely wretched:\nthey were wretched in every way, resembling the echoes of a tiny\nchapel where the solemn worshippers mumble their prayers, asking news\nof one another in low voices, while they repeat with a deeply\nmysterious air the common gossip of politics, weather forecasts and\nthe state of the weather.\n\nBut there was even worse: a female laureate licensed by the Institute,\nMadame Augustus Craven, author of _Recit d'une soeur_, of _Eliane_ and\n_Fleaurange_, puffed into reputation by the whole apostolic press.\nNever, no, never, had Des Esseintes imagined that any person could\nwrite such ridiculous nonsense. In the point of conception, these\nbooks were so absurd, and were written in such a disgusting style,\nthat by these tokens they became almost remarkable and rare.\n\nIt was not at all among the works of women that Des Esseintes, whose\nsoul was completely jaded and whose nature was not inclined to\nsentimentality, could come upon a literary retreat suited to his\ntaste.\n\nYet he strove, with a diligence that no impatience could overcome, to\nenjoy the works of a certain girl of genius, the blue-stocking pucelle\nof the group, but his efforts miscarried. He did not take to the\n_Journal_ and the _Lettres_ in which Eugenie de Guerin celebrates,\nwithout discretion, the amazing talent of a brother who rhymed, with\nsuch cleverness and grace that one must go to the works of de Jouy and\nEcouchard Lebrun to find anything so novel and daring.\n\nHe had also unavailingly attempted to comprehend the delights of those\nworks in which one may find such things as these:\n\n    This morning I hung on papa's bed a cross which a little\n    girl had given him yesterday.\n\nOr:\n\n    Mimi and I are invited by Monsieur Roquiers to attend the\n    consecration of a bell tomorrow. This does not displease\n    me at all.\n\nOr wherein we find such important events as these:\n\n    On my neck I have hung a medal of the Holy Virgin which\n    Louise had brought me, as an amulet against cholera.\n\nOr poetry of this sort:\n\n    O the lovely moonbeam which fell on the Bible I was reading!\n\nAnd, finally, such fine and penetrating observations as these:\n\n    When I see a man pass before a crucifix, lift his hat and\n    make the sign of the Cross, I say to myself, 'There goes a\n    Christian.'\n\nAnd she continued in this fashion, without pause, until after Maurice\nde Guerin had died, after which his sister bewailed him in other\npages, written in a watery prose strewn here and there with bits of\npoems whose humiliating poverty ended by moving Des Esseintes to pity.\n\nAh! it was hardly worth mentioning, but the Catholic party was not at\nall particular in the choice of its proteges and not at all artistic.\nWithout exception, all these writers wrote in the pallid white prose\nof pensioners of a monastery, in a flowing movement of phrase which no\nastringent could counterbalance.\n\nSo Des Esseintes, horror-stricken at such insipidities, entirely\nforsook this literature. But neither did he find atonement for his\ndisappointments among the modern masters of the clergy. These latter\nwere one-sided divines or impeccably correct controversialists, but\nthe Christian language in their orations and books had ended by\nbecoming impersonal and congealing into a rhetoric whose every\nmovement and pause was anticipated, in a sequence of periods\nconstructed after a single model. And, in fact, Des Esseintes\ndiscovered that all the ecclesiastics wrote in the same manner, with a\nlittle more or a little less abandon or emphasis, and there was seldom\nany variations between the bodiless patterns traded by Dupanloup or\nLandriot, La Bouillerie or Gaume, by Dom Gueranger or Ratisbonne, by\nFreppel or Perraud, by Ravignan or Gratry, by Olivain or Dosithee, by\nDidon or Chocarne.\n\nDes Esseintes had often pondered upon this matter. A really authentic\ntalent, a supremely profound originality, a well-anchored conviction,\nhe thought, was needed to animate this formal style which was too\nfrail to support any thought that was unforseen or any thesis that was\naudacious.\n\nYet, despite all this, there were several writers whose burning\neloquence fused and shaped this language, notably Lacordaire, who was\none of the few really great writers the Church had produced for many\nyears.\n\nImmured, like his colleagues, in the narrow circle of orthodox\nspeculations, likewise obliged to dissipate his energies in the\nexclusive consideration of those theories which had been expressed and\nconsecrated by the Fathers of the Church and developed by the masters\nof the pulpit, he succeeded in inbuing them with novelty and in\nrejuvenating, almost in modifying them, by clothing them in a more\npersonal and stimulating form. Here and there in his _Conferences de\nNotre-Dame_, were treasures of expression, audacious usages of words,\naccents of love, rapid movements, cries of joy and distracted\neffusions. Then, to his position as a brilliant and gentle monk whose\ningenuity and labors had been exhausted in the impossible task of\nconciliating the liberal doctrines of society with the authoritarian\ndogmas of the Church, he added a temperament of fierce love and suave\ndiplomatic tenderness. In his letters to young men may be found the\ncaressing inflections of a father exhorting his sons with smiling\nreprimands, the well-meaning advice and the indulgent forgiveness.\nSome of these Des Esseintes found charming, confessing as they did the\nmonk's yearning for affection, while others were even imposing when\nthey sought to sustain courage and dissipate doubts by the inimitable\ncertainties of Faith. In fine, this sentiment of paternity, which gave\nhis pen a delicately feminine quality, lent to his prose a\ncharacteristically individual accent discernible among all the\nclerical literature.\n\nAfter Lacordaire, ecclesiastics and monks possessing any individuality\nwere extremely rare. At the very most, a few pages of his pupil, the\nAbbe Peyreyve, merited reading. He left sympathetic biographies of his\nmaster, wrote a few loveable letters, composed treatises in the\nsonorous language of formal discourse, and delivered panegyrics in\nwhich the declamatory tone was too broadly stressed. Certainly the\nAbbe Peyreyve had neither the emotion nor the ardor of Lacordaire. He\nwas too much a priest and too little a man. Yet, here and there in the\nrhetoric of his sermons, flashed interesting effects of large and\nsolid phrasing or touches of nobility that were almost venerable.\n\nBut to find writers of prose whose works justify close study, one was\nobliged to seek those who had not submitted to Ordination; to the\nsecular writers whom the interests of Catholicism engaged and devoted\nto its cause.\n\nWith the Comte de Falloux, the episcopal style, so stupidly handled by\nthe prelates, recruited new strength and in a manner recovered its\nmasculine vigor. Under his guise of moderation, this academician\nexuded gall. The discourse which he delivered to Parliament in 1848\nwas diffuse and abject, but his articles, first printed in the\n_Correspondant_ and since collected into books, were mordant and\ndiscerning under the exaggerated politeness of their form. Conceived\nas harangues, they contained a certain strong muscular energy and were\nastonishing in the intolerance of their convictions.\n\nA dangerous polemist because of his ambuscades, a shrewd logician,\nexecuting flanking movements and attacking unexpectedly, the Comte de\nFalloux had also written striking, penetrating pages on the death of\nMadame Swetchine, whose tracts he had collected and whom he revered as\na saint.\n\nBut the true temperament of the writer was betrayed in the two\nbrochures which appeared in 1848 and 1880, the latter entitled\n_l'Unite nationale_.\n\nMoved by a cold rage, the implacable legitimist this time fought\nopenly, contrary to his custom, and hurled against the infidels, in\nthe form of a peroration, such fulminating invectives as these:\n\n\"And you, systematic Utopians, who make an abstraction of human\nnature, fomentors of atheism, fed on chimerae and hatreds,\nemancipators of woman, destroyers of the family, genealogists of the\nsimian race, you whose name was but lately an outrage, be satisfied:\nyou shall have been the prophets, and your disciples will be the\nhigh-priests of an abominable future!\"\n\nThe other brochure bore the title _le Parti catholique_ and was\ndirected against the despotism of the _Univers_ and against Veuillot\nwhose name he refused to mention. Here the sinuous attacks were\nresumed, venom filtered beneath each line, when the gentleman, clad in\nblue answered the sharp physical blows of the fighter with scornful\nsarcasms.\n\nThese contestants represented the two parties of the Church, the two\nfactions whose differences were resolved into virulent hatreds. De\nFalloux, the more haughty and cunning, belonged to the liberal camp\nwhich already claimed Montalembert and Cochin, Lacordaire and De\nBroglie. He subscribed to the principles of the _Correspondant_, a\nreview which attempted to cover the imperious theories of the Church\nwith a varnish of tolerance. Veuillot, franker and more open, scorned\nsuch masks, unhesitatingly admitted the tyranny of the ultramontaine\ndoctrines and confessed, with a certain compunction, the pitiless yoke\nof the Church's dogma.\n\nFor the conduct of this verbal warfare, Veuillot had made himself\nmaster of a special style, partly borrowed from La Bruyere and Du\nGros-Caillou. This half-solemn, half-slang style, had the force of a\ntomahawk in the hands of this vehement personality. Strangely\nheadstrong and brave, he had overwhelmed both free thinkers and\nbishops with this terrible weapon, charging at his enemies like a\nbull, regardless of the party to which they belonged. Distrusted by\nthe Church, which would tolerate neither his contraband style nor his\nfortified theories, he had nevertheless overawed everybody by his\npowerful talent, incurring the attack of the entire press which he\neffectively thrashed in his _Odeurs de Paris_, coping with every\nassault, freeing himself with a kick of the foot of all the wretched\nhack-writers who had presumed to attack him.\n\nUnfortunately, this undisputed talent only existed in pugilism. At\npeace, Veuillot was no more than a mediocre writer. His poetry and\nnovels were pitiful. His language was vapid, when it was not engaged\nin a striking controversy. In repose, he changed, uttering banal\nlitanies and mumbling childish hymns.\n\nMore formal, more constrained and more serious was the beloved\napologist of the Church, Ozanam, the inquisitor of the Christian\nlanguage. Although he was very difficult to understand, Des Esseintes\nnever failed to be astonished by the insouciance of this writer, who\nspoke confidently of God's impenetrable designs, although he felt\nobliged to establish proof of the improbable assertions he advanced.\nWith the utmost self-confidence, he deformed events, contradicted,\nwith greater impudence even than the panegyrists of other parties, the\nknown facts of history, averred that the Church had never concealed\nthe esteem it had for science, called heresies impure miasmas, and\ntreated Buddhism and other religions with such contempt that he\napologized for even soiling his Catholic prose by onslaught on their\ndoctrines.\n\nAt times, religious passion breathed a certain ardor into his\noratorical language, under the ice of which seethed a violent current;\nin his numerous writings on Dante, on Saint Francis, on the author of\n_Stabat Mater_, on the Franciscan poets, on socialism, on commercial\nlaw and every imaginable subject, this man pleaded for the defense of\nthe Vatican which he held indefectible, and judged causes and opinions\naccording to their harmony or discord with those that he advanced.\n\nThis manner of viewing questions from a single viewpoint was also the\nmethod of that literary scamp, Nettement, whom some people would have\nmade the other's rival. The latter was less bigoted than the master,\naffected less arrogance and admitted more worldly pretentions. He\nrepeatedly left the literary cloister in which Ozanam had imprisoned\nhimself, and had read secular works so as to be able to judge of them.\nThis province he entered gropingly, like a child in a vault, seeing\nnothing but shadow around him, perceiving in this gloom only the gleam\nof the candle which illumed the place a few paces before him.\n\nIn this gloom, uncertain of his bearings, he stumbled at every turn,\nspeaking of Murger who had \"the care of a chiselled and carefully\nfinished style\"; of Hugo who sought the noisome and unclean and to\nwhom he dared compare De Laprade; of Paul Delacroix who scorned the\nrules; of Paul Delaroche and of the poet Reboul, whom he praised\nbecause of their apparent faith.\n\nDes Esseintes could not restrain a shrug of the shoulders before these\nstupid opinions, covered by a borrowed prose whose already worn\ntexture clung or became torn at each phrase.\n\nIn a different way, the works of Poujoulat and Genoude, Montalembert,\nNicolas and Carne failed to inspire him with any definite interest.\nHis taste for history was not pronounced, even when treated with the\nscholarly fidelity and harmonious style of the Duc de Broglie, nor was\nhis penchant for the social and religious questions, even when\nbroached by Henry Cochin, who revealed his true self in a letter where\nhe gave a stirring account of the taking of the veil at the\nSacre-Coeur. He had not touched these books for a long time, and the\nperiod was already remote when he had thrown with his waste paper the\npuerile lucubrations of the gloomy Pontmartin and the pitiful Feval;\nand long since he had given to his servants, for a certain vulgar\nusage, the short stories of Aubineau and Lasserre, in which are\nrecorded wretched hagiographies of miracles effected by Dupont of\nTours and by the Virgin.\n\nIn no way did Des Esseintes derive even a fugitive distraction from\nhis boredom from this literature. The mass of books which he had once\nstudied he had thrown into dim corners of his library shelves when he\nleft the Fathers' school. \"I should have left them in Paris,\" he told\nhimself, as he turned out some books which were particularly\ninsufferable: those of the Abbe Lamennais and that impervious\nsectarian so magisterially, so pompously dull and empty, the Comte\nJoseph de Maistre.\n\nA single volume remained on a shelf, within reach of his hand. It was\nthe _Homme_ of Ernest Hello. This writer was the absolute opposite of\nhis religious confederates. Almost isolated among the pious group\nterrified by his conduct, Ernest Hello had ended by abandoning the\nopen road that led from earth to heaven. Probably disgusted by the\ndullness of the journey and the noisy mob of those pilgrims of letters\nwho for centuries followed one after the other upon the same highway,\nmarching in each other's steps, stopping at the same places to\nexchange the same commonplace remarks on religion, on the Church\nFathers, on their similar beliefs, on their common masters, he had\ndeparted through the byways to wander in the gloomy glade of Pascal,\nwhere he tarried long to recover his breath before continuing on his\nway and going even farther in the regions of human thought than the\nJansenist, whom he derided.\n\nTortuous and precious, doctoral and complex, Hello, by the piercing\ncunning of his analysis, recalled to Des Esseintes the sharp, probing\ninvestigations of some of the infidel psychologists of the preceding\nand present century. In him was a sort of Catholic Duranty, but more\ndogmatic and penetrating, an experienced manipulation of the\nmagnifying glass, a sophisticated engineer of the soul, a skillful\nwatchmaker of the brain, delighting to examine the mechanism of a\npassion and elucidate it by details of the wheel work.\n\nIn this oddly formed mind existed unsurmised relationships of\nthoughts, harmonies and oppositions; furthermore, he affected a wholly\nnovel manner of action which used the etymology of words as a\nspring-board for ideas whose associations sometimes became tenuous,\nbut which almost constantly remained ingenious and sparkling.\n\nThus, despite the awkwardness of his structure, he dissected with a\nsingular perspicacity, the _Avare_, \"the ordinary man,\" and \"the\npassion of unhappiness,\" revealing meanwhile interesting comparisons\nwhich could be constructed between the operations of photography and\nof memory.\n\nBut such skill in handling this perfected instrument of analysis,\nstolen from the enemies of the Church, represented only one of the\ntemperamental phases of this man.\n\nStill another existed. This mind divided itself in two parts and\nrevealed, besides the writer, the religious fanatic and Biblical\nprophet.\n\nLike Hugo, whom he now and again recalled in distortions of phrases\nand words, Ernest Hello had delighted in imitating Saint John of\nPatmos. He pontificated and vaticinated from his retreat in the rue\nSaint-Sulpice, haranguing the reader with an apocalyptic language\npartaking in spots of the bitterness of an Isaiah.\n\nHe affected inordinate pretentions of profundity. There were some\nfawning and complacent people who pretended to consider him a great\nman, the reservoir of learning, the encyclopedic giant of the age.\nPerhaps he was a well, but one at whose bottom one often could not\nfind a drop of water.\n\nIn his volume _Paroles de Dieu_, he paraphrased the Holy Scriptures,\nendeavoring to complicate their ordinarily obvious sense. In his other\nbook _Homme_, and in his brochure _le Jour du Seigneur_, written in a\nbiblical style, rugged and obscure, he sought to appear like a\nvengeful apostle, prideful and tormented with spleen, but showed\nhimself a deacon touched with a mystic epilepsy, or like a talented\nMaistre, a surly and bitter sectarian.\n\nBut, thought Des Esseintes, this sickly shamelessness often obstructed\nthe inventive sallies of the casuist. With more intolerance than even\nOzanam, he resolutely denied all that pertained to his clan,\nproclaimed the most disconcerting axioms, maintained with a\ndisconcerting authority that \"geology is returning toward Moses,\" and\nthat natural history, like chemistry and every contemporary science,\nverifies the scientific truth of the Bible. The proposition on each\npage was of the unique truth and the superhuman knowledge of the\nChurch, and everywhere were interspersed more than perilous aphorisms\nand raging curses cast at the art of the last century.\n\nTo this strange mixture was added the love of sanctimonious delights,\nsuch as a translation of the _Visions_ by Angele de Foligno, a book of\nan unparalleled fluid stupidity, with selected works of Jean Rusbrock\nl'Admirable, a mystic of the thirteenth century whose prose offered an\nincomprehensible but alluring combination of dusky exaltations,\ncaressing effusions, and poignant transports.\n\nThe whole attitude of this presumptuous pontiff, Hello, had leaped\nfrom a preface written for this book. He himself remarked that\n\"extraordinary things can only be stammered,\" and he stammered in good\ntruth, declaring that \"the holy gloom where Rusbrock extends his eagle\nwings is his ocean, his prey, his glory, and for such as him the far\nhorizons would be a too narrow garment.\"\n\nHowever this might be, Des Esseintes felt himself intrigued toward\nthis ill-balanced but subtile mind. No fusion had been effected\nbetween the skilful psychologist and the pious pedant, and the very\njolts and incoherencies constituted the personality of the man.\n\nWith him was recruited the little group of writers who fought on the\nfront battle line of the clerical camp. They did not belong to the\nregular army, but were more properly the scouts of a religion which\ndistrusted men of such talent as Veuillot and Hello, because they did\nnot seem sufficiently submissive and shallow. What the Church really\ndesires is soldiers who do not reason, files of such blind combatants\nand such mediocrities as Hello describes with the rage of one who has\nsubmitted to their yoke. Thus it was that Catholicism had lost no time\nin driving away one of its partisans, an enraged pamphleteer who wrote\nin a style at once rare and exasperated, the savage Leon Bloy; and\ncaused to be cast from the doors of its bookshops, as it would a\nplague or a filthy vagrant, another writer who had made himself hoarse\nwith celebrating its praises, Barbey d'Aurevilly.\n\nIt is true that the latter was too prone to compromise and not\nsufficiently docile. Others bent their heads under rebukes and\nreturned to the ranks; but he was the _enfant terrible_, and was\nunrecognized by the party. In a literary way, he pursued women whom he\ndragged into the sanctuary. Nay, even that vast disdain was invoked,\nwith which Catholicism enshrouds talent to prevent excommunication\nfrom putting beyond the pale of the law a perplexing servant who,\nunder pretext of honoring his masters, broke the window panes of the\nchapel, juggled with the holy pyxes and executed eccentric dances\naround the tabernacle.\n\nTwo works of Barbey d'Aurevilly specially attracted Des Esseintes, the\n_Pretre marie_ and the _Diaboliques_. Others, such as the _Ensorcele_,\nthe _Chevalier des touches_ and _Une Vieille Maitresse_, were\ncertainly more comprehensive and more finely balanced, but they left\nDes Esseintes untouched, for he was really interested only in\nunhealthy works which were consumed and irritated by fever.\n\nIn these all but healthy volumes, Barbey d'Aurevilly constantly\nhesitated between those two pits which the Catholic religion succeeds\nin reconciling: mysticism and sadism.\n\nIn these two books which Des Esseintes was thumbing, Barbey had lost\nall prudence, given full rein to his steed, and galloped at full speed\nover roads to their farthest limits.\n\nAll the mysterious horror of the Middle Ages hovered over that\nimprobable book, the _Pretre marie_; magic blended with religion,\nblack magic with prayer and, more pitiless and savage than the Devil\nhimself, the God of Original Sin incessantly tortured the innocent\nCalixte, His reprobate, as once He had caused one of his angels to\nmark the houses of unbelievers whom he wished to slay.\n\nConceived by a fasting monk in the grip of delirium, these scenes were\nunfolded in the uneven style of a tortured soul. Unfortunately, among\nthose disordered creatures that were like galvanized Coppelias of\nHoffmann, some, like Neel de Nehou, seemed to have been imagined in\nmoments of exhaustion following convulsions, and were discordant notes\nin this harmony of sombre madness, where they were as comical and\nridiculous as a tiny zinc figure playing on a horn on a timepiece.\n\nAfter these mystic divagations, the writer had experienced a period of\ncalm. Then a terrible relapse followed.\n\nThis belief that man is a Buridanesque donkey, a being balanced\nbetween two forces of equal attraction which successively remain\nvictorious and vanquished, this conviction that human life is only an\nuncertain combat waged between hell and heaven, this faith in two\nopposite beings, Satan and Christ, was fatally certain to engender\nsuch inner discords of the soul, exalted by incessant struggle,\nexcited at once by promises and menaces, and ending by abandoning\nitself to whichever of the two forces persisted in the pursuit the\nmore relentlessly.\n\nIn the _Pretre marie_, Barbey d'Aurevilly sang the praises of Christ,\nwho had prevailed against temptations; in the _Diaboliques_, the\nauthor succumbed to the Devil, whom he celebrated; then appeared\nsadism, that bastard of Catholicism, which through the centuries\nreligion has relentlessly pursued with its exorcisms and stakes.\n\nThis condition, at once fascinating and ambiguous, can not arise in\nthe soul of an unbeliever. It does not merely consist in sinking\noneself in the excesses of the flesh, excited by outrageous\nblasphemies, for in such a case it would be no more than a case of\nsatyriasis that had reached its climax. Before all, it consists in\nsacrilegious practice, in moral rebellion, in spiritual debauchery, in\na wholly ideal aberration, and in this it is exemplarily Christian. It\nalso is founded upon a joy tempered by fear, a joy analogous to the\nsatisfaction of children who disobey their parents and play with\nforbidden things, for no reason other than that they had been\nforbidden to do so.\n\nIn fact, if it did not admit of sacrilege, sadism would have no reason\nfor existence. Besides, the sacrilege proceeding from the very\nexistence of a religion, can only be intentionally and pertinently\nperformed by a believer, for no one would take pleasure in profaning a\nfaith that was indifferent or unknown to him.\n\nThe power of sadism and the attraction it presents, lies entirely then\nin the prohibited enjoyment of transferring to Satan the praises and\nprayers due to God; it lies in the non-observance of Catholic precepts\nwhich one really follows unwillingly, by committing in deeper scorn of\nChrist, those sins which the Church has especially cursed, such as\npollution of worship and carnal orgy.\n\nIn its elements, this phenomenon to which the Marquis de Sade has\nbequeathed his name is as old as the Church. It had reared its head in\nthe eighteenth century, recalling, to go back no farther, by a simple\nphenomenon of atavism the impious practices of the Sabbath, the\nwitches' revels of the Middle Ages.\n\nBy having consulted the _Malleus maleficorum_, that terrible code of\nJacob Sprenger which permits the Church wholesale burnings of\nnecromancers and sorcerers, Des Esseintes recognized in the witches'\nSabbath, all the obscene practices and all the blasphemies of sadism.\nIn addition to the unclean scenes beloved by Malin, the nights\nsuccessively and lawfully consecrated to excessive sensual orgies and\ndevoted to the bestialities of passion, he once more discovered the\nparody of the processions, the insults and eternal threats levelled at\nGod and the devotion bestowed upon His rival, while amid cursing of\nthe wine and the bread, the black mass was being celebrated on the\nback of a woman on all fours, whose stained bare thighs served as the\naltar from which the congregation received the communion from a black\ngoblet stamped with an image of a goat.\n\nThis profusion of impure mockeries and foul shames were marked in the\ncareer of the Marquis de Sade, who garnished his terrible pleasures\nwith outrageous sacrileges.\n\nHe cried out to the sky, invoked Lucifer, shouted his contempt of God,\ncalling Him rogue and imbecile, spat upon the communion, endeavored to\ncontaminate with vile ordures a Divinity who he prayed might damn him,\nthe while he declared, to defy Him the more, that He did not exist.\n\nBarbey d'Aurevilly approached this psychic state. If he did not\npresume as far as De Sade in uttering atrocious curses against the\nSaviour; if, more prudent or more timid, he claimed ever to honor the\nChurch, he none the less addressed his suit to the Devil as was done\nin medieval times and he, too, in order to brave God, fell into\ndemoniac nymphomania, inventing sensual monstrosities, even borrowing\nfrom bedroom philosophy a certain episode which he seasoned with new\ncondiments when he wrote the story _le Diner d'un athee_.\n\nThis extravagant book pleased Des Esseintes. He had caused to be\nprinted, in violet ink and in a frame of cardinal purple, on a genuine\nparchment which the judges of the Rota had blessed, a copy of the\n_Diaboliques_, with characters whose quaint quavers and flourishes in\nturned up tails and claws affected a satanic form.\n\nAfter certain pieces of Baudelaire that, in imitation of the clamorous\nsongs of nocturnal revels, celebrated infernal litanies, this volume\nalone of all the works of contemporary apostolic literature testified\nto this state of mind, at once impious and devout, toward which\nCatholicism often thrust Des Esseintes.\n\nWith Barbey d'Aurevilly ended the line of religious writers; and in\ntruth, that pariah belonged more, from every point of view, to secular\nliterature than to the other with which he demanded a place that was\ndenied him. His language was the language of disheveled romanticism,\nfull of involved expressions, unfamiliar turns of speech, delighted\nwith extravagant comparisons and with whip strokes and phrases which\nexploded, like the clangor of noisy bells, along the text. In short,\nd'Aurevilly was like a stallion among the geldings of the\nultramontaine stables.\n\nDes Esseintes reflected in this wise while re-reading, here and there,\nseveral passages of the book and, comparing its nervous and changing\nstyle with the fixed manner of other Church writers, he thought of the\nevolution of language which Darwin has so truly revealed.\n\nCompelled to live in a secular atmosphere, raised in the heart of the\nromantic school, constantly being in the current of modern literature\nand accustomed to reading contemporary publications, Barbey\nd'Aurevilly had acquired a dialect which although it had sustained\nnumerous and profound changes since the Great Age, had nevertheless\nrenewed itself in his works.\n\nThe ecclesiastical writers, on the contrary, confined within specific\nlimitations, restricted to ancient Church literature, knowing nothing\nof the literary progress of the centuries and determined if need be to\nblind their eyes the more surely not to see, necessarily were\nconstrained to the use of an inflexible language, like that of the\neighteenth century which descendants of the French who settled in\nCanada still speak and write today, without change of phrasing or\nwords, having succeeded in preserving their original idiom by\nisolation in certain metropolitan centres, despite the fact that they\nare enveloped upon every side by English-speaking peoples.\n\nMeanwhile the silvery sound of a clock that tolled the angelus\nannounced breakfast time to Des Esseintes. He abandoned his books,\npressed his brow and went to the dining room, saying to himself that,\namong all the volumes he had just arranged, the works of Barbey\nd'Aurevilly were the only ones whose ideas and style offered the\ngaminess he so loved to savor in the Latin and decadent, monastic\nwriters of past ages.\n\n\n\n\n    Chapter 13\n\n\nAs the season advanced, the weather, far from improving, grew worse.\nEverything seemed to go wrong that year. After the squalls and mists,\nthe sky was covered with a white expanse of heat, like plates of sheet\niron. In two days, without transition, a torrid heat, an atmosphere of\nfrightful heaviness, succeeded the damp cold of foggy days and the\nstreaming of the rains. As though stirred by furious pokers, the sun\nshowed like a kiln-hole, darting a light almost white-hot, burning\none's face. A hot dust rose from the roads, scorching the dry trees,\nand the yellowed lawns became a deep brown. A temperature like that of\na foundry hung over the dwelling of Des Esseintes.\n\nHalf naked, he opened a window and received the air like a furnace\nblast in his face. The dining room, to which he fled, was fiery, and\nthe rarefied air simmered. Utterly distressed, he sat down, for the\nstimulation that had seized him had ended since the close of his\nreveries.\n\nLike all people tormented by nervousness, heat distracted him. And his\nanaemia, checked by cold weather, again became pronounced, weakening\nhis body which had been debilitated by copious perspiration.\n\nThe back of his shirt was saturated, his perinaeum was damp, his feet\nand arms moist, his brow overflowing with sweat that ran down his\ncheeks. Des Esseintes reclined, annihilated, on a chair.\n\nThe sight of the meat placed on the table at that moment caused his\nstomach to rise. He ordered the food removed, asked for boiled eggs,\nand tried to swallow some bread soaked in eggs, but his stomach would\nhave none of it. A fit of nausea overcame him. He drank a few drops of\nwine that pricked his stomach like points of fire. He wet his face;\nthe perspiration, alternately warm and cold, coursed along his\ntemples. He began to suck some pieces of ice to overcome his troubled\nheart--but in vain.\n\nSo weak was he that he leaned against the table. He rose, feeling the\nneed of air, but the bread had slowly risen in his gullet and remained\nthere. Never had he felt so distressed, so shattered, so ill at ease.\nTo add to his discomfort, his eyes distressed him and he saw objects\nin double. Soon he lost his sense of distance, and his glass seemed to\nbe a league away. He told himself that he was the play-thing of\nsensorial illusions and that he was incapable of reacting. He\nstretched out on a couch, but instantly he was cradled as by the\ntossing of a moving ship, and the affection of his heart increased. He\nrose to his feet, determined to rid himself, by means of a digestive,\nof the food which was choking him.\n\nHe again reached the dining room and sadly compared himself, in this\ncabin, to passengers seized with sea-sickness. Stumbling, he made his\nway to the closet, examined the mouth organ without opening any of the\nstops, but instead took from a high shelf a bottle of benedictine\nwhich he kept because of its form which to him seemed suggestive of\nthoughts that were at once gently wanton and vaguely mystic.\n\nBut at this moment he remained indifferent, gazing with lack-lustre,\nstaring eyes at this squat, dark-green bottle which, at other times,\nhad brought before him images of the medieval priories by its\nold-fashioned monkish paunch, its head and neck covered with a\nparchment hood, its red wax stamp quartered with three silver mitres\nagainst a field of azure and fastened at the neck, like a papal bull,\nwith bands of lead, its label inscribed in sonorous Latin, on paper\nthat seemed to have yellowed with age: _Liquor Monachorum\nBenedictinorum Abbatiae Fiscannensis_.\n\nUnder this thoroughly abbatial robe, signed with a cross and the\necclesiastic initials 'D.O.M.', pressed in between its parchments and\nligatures, slept an exquisitely fine saffron-colored liquid. It\nbreathed an aroma that seemed the quintessence of angelica and hyssop\nblended with sea-weeds and of iodines and bromes hidden in sweet\nessences, and it stimulated the palate with a spiritous ardor\nconcealed under a virginal daintiness, and charmed the sense of smell\nby a pungency enveloped in a caress innocent and devout.\n\nThis deceit which resulted from the extraordinary disharmony between\ncontents and container, between the liturgic form of the flask and its\nso feminine and modern soul, had formerly stimulated Des Esseintes to\nrevery and, facing the bottle, he was inclined to think at great\nlength of the monks who sold it, the Benedictines of the Abbey of\nFecamp who, belonging to the brotherhood of Saint-Maur which had been\ncelebrated for its controversial works under the rule of Saint Benoit,\nfollowed neither the observances of the white monks of Citeaux nor of\nthe black monks of Cluny. He could not but think of them as being like\ntheir brethren of the Middle Ages, cultivating simples, heating\nretorts and distilling faultless panaceas and prescriptions.\n\nHe tasted a drop of this liquor and, for a few moments, had relief.\nBut soon the fire, which the dash of wine had lit in his bowels,\nrevived. He threw down his napkin, returned to his study, and paced\nthe floor. He felt as if he were under a pneumatic clock, and a\nnumbing weakness stole from his brain through his limbs. Unable to\nendure it longer, he betook himself to the garden. It was the first\ntime he had done this since his arrival at Fontenay. There he found\nshelter beneath a tree which radiated a circle of shadow. Seated on\nthe lawn, he looked around with a besotted air at the square beds of\nvegetables planted by the servants. He gazed, but it was only at the\nend of an hour that he really saw them, for a greenish film floated\nbefore his eyes, permitting him only to see, as in the depths of\nwater, flickering images of shifting tones.\n\nBut when he recovered his balance, he clearly distinguished the onions\nand cabbages, a garden bed of lettuce further off, and, in the\ndistance along the hedge, a row of white lillies recumbent in the\nheavy air.\n\nA smile played on his lips, for he suddenly recalled the strange\ncomparison of old Nicandre, who likened, in the point of form, the\npistils of lillies to the genital organs of a donkey; and he recalled\nalso a passage from Albert le Grand, in which that thaumaturgist\ndescribes a strange way of discovering whether a girl is still a\nvirgin, by means of a lettuce.\n\nThese remembrances distracted him somewhat. He examined the garden,\ninteresting himself in the plants withered by the heat, and in the hot\nground whose vapors rose into the dusty air. Then, above the hedge\nwhich separated the garden below from the embankment leading to the\nfort, he watched the urchins struggling and tumbling on the ground.\n\nHe was concentrating his attention upon them when another younger,\nsorry little specimen appeared. He had hair like seaweed covered with\nsand, two green bubbles beneath his nose, and disgusting lips\nsurrounded by a dirty white frame formed by a slice of bread smeared\nwith cheese and filled with pieces of scallions.\n\nDes Esseintes inhaled the air. A perverse appetite seized him. This\ndirty slice made his mouth water. It seemed to him that his stomach,\nrefusing all other nourishment, could digest this shocking food, and\nthat his palate would enjoy it as though it were a feast.\n\nHe leaped up, ran to the kitchen and ordered a loaf, white cheese and\ngreen onions to be brought from the village, emphasizing his desire\nfor a slice exactly like the one being eaten by the child. Then he\nreturned to sit beneath the tree.\n\nThe little chaps were fighting with one another. They struggled for\nbits of bread which they shoved into their cheeks, meanwhile sucking\ntheir fingers. Kicks and blows rained freely, and the weakest,\ntrampled upon, cried out.\n\nAt this sight, Des Esseintes recovered his animation. The interest he\ntook in this fight distracted his thoughts from his illness.\nContemplating the blind fury of these urchins, he thought of the cruel\nand abominable law of the struggle of existence; and, although these\nchildren were mean, he could not help being interested in their\nfutures, yet could not but believe that it had been better for them\nhad their mothers never given them birth.\n\nIn fact, all they could expect of life was rash, colic, fever, and\nmeasles in their earliest years; slaps in the face and degrading\ndrudgeries up to thirteen years; deceptions by women, sicknesses and\ninfidelity during manhood and, toward the last, infirmities and\nagonies in a poorhouse or asylum.\n\nAnd the future was the same for every one, and none in his good senses\ncould envy his neighbor. The rich had the same passions, the same\nanxieties, the same pains and the same illnesses, but in a different\nenvironment; the same mediocre enjoyments, whether alcoholic, literary\nor carnal. There was even a vague compensation in evils, a sort of\njustice which re-established the balance of misfortune between the\nclasses, permitting the poor to bear physical suffering more easily,\nand making it difficult for the unresisting, weaker bodies of the rich\nto withstand it.\n\nHow vain, silly and mad it is to beget brats! And Des Esseintes\nthought of those ecclesiastics who had taken vows of sterility, yet\nwere so inconsistent as to canonize Saint Vincent de Paul, because he\nbrought vain tortures to innocent creatures.\n\nBy means of his hateful precautions, Vincent de Paul had deferred for\nyears the death of unintelligent and insensate beings, in such a way\nthat when they later became almost intelligent and sentient to grief,\nthey were able to anticipate the future, to await and fear that death\nof whose very name they had of late been ignorant, some of them going\nas far to invoke it, in hatred of that sentence of life which the monk\ninflicted upon them by an absurd theological code.\n\nAnd since this old man's death, his ideas had prevailed. Abandoned\nchildren were sheltered instead of being killed and yet their lives\ndaily became increasingly rigorous and barren! Then, under pretext of\nliberty and progress, Society had discovered another means of\nincreasing man's miseries by tearing him from his home, forcing him to\ndon a ridiculous uniform and carry weapons, by brutalizing him in a\nslavery in every respect like that from which he had compassionately\nfreed the negro, and all to enable him to slaughter his neighbor\nwithout risking the scaffold like ordinary murderers who operate\nsingle-handed, without uniforms and with weapons that are less swift\nand deafening.\n\nDes Esseintes wondered if there had ever been such a time as ours. Our\nage invokes the causes of humanity, endeavors to perfect anaesthesia\nto suppress physical suffering. Yet at the same time it prepares these\nvery stimulants to increase moral wretchedness.\n\nAh! if ever this useless procreation should be abolished, it were now.\nBut here, again, the laws enacted by men like Portalis and Homais\nappeared strange and cruel.\n\nIn the matter of generation, Justice finds the agencies for deception\nto be quite natural. It is a recognized and acknowledged fact. There\nis scarcely a home of any station that does not confide its children\nto the drain pipes, or that does not employ contrivances that are\nfreely sold, and which it would enter no person's mind to prohibit.\nAnd yet, if these subterfuges proved insufficient, if the attempt\nmiscarried and if, to remedy matters, one had recourse to more\nefficacious measures, ah! then there were not prisons enough, not\nmunicipal jails enough to confine those who, in good faith, were\ncondemned by other individuals who had that very evening, on the\nconjugal bed, done their utmost to avoid giving birth to children.\n\nThe deceit itself was not a crime, it seemed. The crime lay in the\njustification of the deceit.\n\nWhat Society considered a crime was the act of killing a being endowed\nwith life; and yet, in expelling a foetus, one destroyed an animal\nthat was less formed and living and certainly less intelligent and\nmore ugly than a dog or a cat, although it is permissible to strangle\nthese creatures as soon as they are born.\n\nIt is only right to add, for the sake of fairness, thought Des\nEsseintes, that it is not the awkward man, who generally loses no time\nin disappearing, but rather the woman, the victim of his stupidity,\nwho expiates the crime of having saved an innocent life.\n\nYet was it right that the world should be filled with such prejudice\nas to wish to repress manoeuvres so natural that primitive man, the\nPolynesian savage, for instance, instinctively practices them?\n\nThe servant interrupted the charitable reflections of Des Esseintes,\nwho received the slice of bread on a plate of vermeil. Pains shot\nthrough his heart. He did not have the courage to eat this bread, for\nthe unhealthy excitement of his stomach had ceased. A sensation of\nfrightful decay swept upon him. He was compelled to rise. The sun\nturned, and slowly fell upon the place that he had lately occupied.\nThe heat became more heavy and fierce.\n\n\"Throw this slice of bread to those children who are murdering each\nother on the road,\" he ordered his servant. \"Let the weakest be\ncrippled, be denied share in the prize, and be soundly thrashed into\nthe bargain, as they will be when they return to their homes with torn\ntrousers and bruised eyes. This will give them an idea of the life\nthat awaits them!\"\n\nAnd he entered the house and sank into his armchair.\n\n\"But I must try to eat something,\" he said. And he attempted to soak a\nbiscuit in old Constantia wine, several bottles of which remained in\nhis cellar.\n\nThat wine, the color of slightly burned onions, partaking of Malaga\nand Port, but with a specially luscious flavor, and an after-taste of\ngrapes dried by fiery suns, had often comforted him, given a new\nenergy to his stomach weakened by the fasts which he was forced to\nundergo. But this cordial, usually so efficacious, now failed. Then he\nthought that an emollient might perhaps counteract the fiery pains\nwhich were consuming him, and he took out the Nalifka, a Russian\nliqueur, contained in a bottle frosted with unpolished glass. This\nunctuous raspberry-flavored syrup also failed. Alas! the time was far\noff when, enjoying good health, Des Esseintes had ridden to his house\nin the hot summer days in a sleigh, and there, covered with furs\nwrapped about his chest, forced himself to shiver, saying, as he\nlistened attentively to the chattering of his teeth: \"Ah, how biting\nthis wind is! It is freezing!\" Thus he had almost succeeded in\nconvincing himself that it was cold.\n\nUnfortunately, such remedies as these had failed of their purpose ever\nsince his sickness became vital.\n\nWith all this, he was unable to make use of laudanum: instead of\nallaying the pain, this sedative irritated him even to the degree of\ndepriving him of rest. At one time he had endeavored to procure\nvisions through opium and hashish, but these two substances had led to\nvomitings and intense nervous disturbances. He had instantly been\nforced to give up the idea of taking them, and without the aid of\nthese coarse stimulants, demand of his brain alone to transport him\ninto the land of dreams, far, far from life.\n\n\"What a day!\" he said to himself, sponging his neck, feeling every\nounce of his strength dissolve in perspiration; a feverish agitation\nstill prevented him from remaining in one spot; once more he walked up\nand down, trying every chair in the room in turn. Wearied of the\nstruggle, at last he fell against his bureau and leaning mechanically\nagainst the table, without thinking of anything, he touched an\nastrolabe which rested on a mass of books and notes and served as a\npaper weight.\n\nHe had purchased this engraved and gilded copper instrument (it had\ncome from Germany and dated from the seventeenth century) of a\nsecond-hand Paris dealer, after a visit to the Cluny Museum, where he\nhad stood for a long while in ecstatic admiration before a marvelous\nastrolabe made of chiseled ivory, whose cabalistic appearance\nenchanted him.\n\nThis paper weight evoked many reminiscences within him. Aroused and\nactuated by the appearance of this trinket, his thoughts rushed from\nFontenay to Paris, to the curio shop where he had purchased it, then\nreturned to the Museum, and he mentally beheld the ivory astrolabe,\nwhile his unseeing eyes continued to gaze upon the copper astrolabe on\nthe table.\n\nThen he left the Museum and, without quitting the town, strolled down\nthe streets, wandered through the rue du Sommerard and the boulevard\nSaint-Michel, branched off into the neighboring streets, and paused\nbefore certain shops whose quite extraordinary appearance and\nprofusion had often attracted him.\n\nBeginning with an astrolabe, this spiritual jaunt ended in the cafes\nof the Latin Quarter.\n\nHe remembered how these places were crowded in the rue\nMonsieur-le-Prince and at the end of the rue de Vaugirard, touching\nthe Odeon; sometimes they followed one another like the old _riddecks_\nof the Canal-aux-Harengs, at Antwerp, each of which revealed a front,\nthe counterpart of its neighbor.\n\nThrough the half-opened doors and the windows dimmed with colored\npanes or curtains, he had often seen women who walked about like\ngeese; others, on benches, rested their elbows on the marble tables,\nhumming, their temples resting between their hands; still others\nstrutted and posed in front of mirrors, playing with their false hair\npomaded by hair-dressers; others, again, took money from their purses\nand methodically sorted the different denominations in little heaps.\n\nMost of them had heavy features, hoarse voices, flabby necks and\npainted eyes; and all of them, like automatons, moved simultaneously\nupon the same impulse, flung the same enticements with the same tone\nand uttered the identical queer words, the same odd inflections and\nthe same smile.\n\nCertain ideas associated themselves in the mind of Des Esseintes,\nwhose reveries came to an end, now that he recalled this collection of\ncoffee-houses and streets.\n\nHe understood the significance of those cafes which reflected the\nstate of soul of an entire generation, and from it he discovered the\nsynthesis of the period.\n\nAnd, in fact, the symptoms were certain and obvious. The houses of\nprostitution disappeared, and as soon as one of them closed, a cafe\nbegan to operate.\n\nThis restriction of prostitution which proved profitable to\nclandestine loves, evidently arose from the incomprehensible illusions\nof men in the matter of carnal life.\n\nMonstrous as it may appear, these haunts satisfied an ideal.\n\nAlthough the utilitarian tendencies transmitted by heredity and\ndeveloped by the precocious rudeness and constant brutalities of the\ncolleges had made the youth of the day strangely crude and as\nstrangely positive and cold, it had none the less preserved, in the\nback of their heads, an old blue flower, an old ideal of a vague, sour\naffection.\n\nToday, when the blood clamored, youths could not bring themselves to\ngo through the formality of entering, ending, paying and leaving; in\ntheir eyes, this was bestiality, the action of a dog attacking a bitch\nwithout much ado. Then, too, vanity fled unsatisfied from these houses\nwhere there was no semblance of resistance; there was no victory, no\nhoped for preference, nor even largess obtained from the tradeswoman\nwho measured her caresses according to the price. On the contrary, the\ncourting of a girl of the cafes stimulated all the susceptibilities of\nlove, all the refinements of sentiment. One disputed with the others\nfor such a girl, and those to whom she granted a rendezvous, in\nconsideration of much money, were sincere in imagining that they had\nwon her from a rival, and in so thinking they were the objects of\nhonorary distinction and favor.\n\nYet this domesticity was as stupid, as selfish, as vile as that of\nhouses of ill-fame. Its creatures drank without being thirsty, laughed\nwithout reason, were charmed by the caresses of a slut, quarrelled and\nfought for no reason whatever, despite everything. The Parisian youth\nhad not been able to see that these girls were, from the point of\nplastic beauty, graceful attitudes and necessary attire, quite\ninferior to the women in the bawdy houses! \"My God,\" Des Esseintes\nexclaimed, \"what ninnies are these fellows who flutter around the\ncafes; for, over and above their silly illusions, they forget the\ndanger of degraded, suspicious allurements, and they are unaware of\nthe sums of money given for affairs priced in advance by the mistress,\nof the time lost in waiting for an assignation deferred so as to\nincrease its value and cost, delays which are repeated to provide more\ntips for the waiters.\"\n\nThis imbecile sentimentality, combined with a ferociously practical\nsense, represented the dominant motive of the age. These very persons\nwho would have gouged their neighbors' eyes to gain ten _sous_, lost\nall presence of mind and discrimination before suspicious looking\ngirls in restaurants who pitilessly harassed and relentlessly fleeced\nthem. Fathers devoted their lives to their businesses and labors,\nfamilies devoured one another on the pretext of trade, only to be\nrobbed by their sons who, in turn, allowed themselves to be fleeced by\nwomen who posed as sweethearts to obtain their money.\n\nIn all Paris, from east to west and from north to south, there existed\nan unbroken chain of female tricksters, a system of organized theft,\nand all because, instead of satisfying men at once, these women were\nskilled in the subterfuges of delay.\n\nAt bottom, one might say that human wisdom consisted in the\nprotraction of all things, in saying \"no\" before saying \"yes,\" for one\ncould manage people only by trifling with them.\n\n\"Ah! if the same were but true of the stomach,\" sighed Des Esseintes,\nracked by a cramp which instantly and sharply brought back his mind,\nthat had roved far off, to Fontenay.\n\n\n\n\n    Chapter 14\n\n\nSeveral days slowly passed thanks to certain measures which succeeded\nin tricking the stomach, but one morning Des Esseintes could endure\nfood no longer, and he asked himself anxiously whether his already\nserious weakness would not grow worse and force him to take to bed. A\nsudden gleam of light relieved his distress; he remembered that one of\nhis friends, quite ill at one time, had made use of a Papin's digester\nto overcome his anaemia and preserve what little strength he had.\n\nHe dispatched his servant to Paris for this precious utensil, and\nfollowing the directions contained in the prospectus which the\nmanufacturer had enclosed, he himself instructed the cook how to cut\nthe roast beef into bits, put it into the pewter pot, with a slice of\nleek and carrot, and screw on the cover to let it boil for four hours.\n\nAt the end of this time the meat fibres were strained. He drank a\nspoonful of the thick salty juice deposited at the bottom of the pot.\nThen he felt a warmth, like a smooth caress, descend upon him.\n\nThis nourishment relieved his pain and nausea, and even strengthened\nhis stomach which did not refuse to accept these few drops of soup.\n\nThanks to this digester, his neurosis was arrested and Des Esseintes\nsaid to himself: \"Well, it is so much gained; perhaps the temperature\nwill change, the sky will throw some ashes upon this abominable sun\nwhich exhausts me, and I shall hold out without accident till the\nfirst fogs and frosts of winter.\"\n\nIn the torpor and listless ennui in which he was sunk, the disorder of\nhis library, whose arrangement had never been completed, irritated\nhim. Helpless in his armchair, he had constantly in sight the books\nset awry on the shelves propped against each other or lying flat on\ntheir sides, like a tumbled pack of cards. This disorder offended him\nthe more when he contrasted it with the perfect order of his religious\nworks, carefully placed on parade along the walls.\n\nHe tried to clear up the confusion, but after ten minutes of work,\nperspiration covered him; the effort weakened him. He stretched\nhimself on a couch and rang for his servant.\n\nFollowing his directions, the old man continued the task, bringing\neach book in turn to Des Esseintes who examined it and directed where\nit was to be placed.\n\nThis task did not last long, for Des Esseintes' library contained but\na very limited number of contemporary, secular works.\n\nThey were drawn through his brain as bands of metal are drawn through\na steel-plate from which they issue thin, light, and reduced to almost\nimperceptible wires; and he had ended by possessing only those books\nwhich could submit to such treatment and which were so solidly\ntempered as to withstand the rolling-mill of each new reading. In his\ndesire to refine, he had restrained and almost sterilized his\nenjoyment, ever accentuating the irremediable conflict existing\nbetween his ideas and those of the world in which he had happened to\nbe born. He had now reached such a pass that he could no longer\ndiscover any writings to content his secret longings. And his\nadmiration even weaned itself from those volumes which had certainly\ncontributed to sharpen his mind, making it so suspicious and subtle.\n\nIn art, his ideas had sprung from a simple point of view. For him\nschools did not exist, and only the temperament of the writer\nmattered, only the working of his brain interested him, regardless of\nthe subject. Unfortunately, this verity of appreciation, worthy of\nPalisse, was scarcely applicable, for the simple reason that, even\nwhile desiring to be free of prejudices and passion, each person\nnaturally goes to the works which most intimately correspond with his\nown temperament, and ends by relegating all others to the rear.\n\nThis work of selection had slowly acted within him; not long ago he\nhad adored the great Balzac, but as his body weakened and his nerves\nbecame troublesome, his tastes modified and his admirations changed.\n\nVery soon, and despite the fact that he was aware of his injustice to\nthe amazing author of the _Comedie humaine_, Des Esseintes had reached\na point where he no longer opened Balzac's books; their healthy spirit\njarred on him. Other aspirations now stirred in him, somehow becoming\nundefinable.\n\nYet when he probed himself he understood that to attract, a work must\nhave that character of strangeness demanded by Edgar Allen Poe; but he\nventured even further on this path and called for Byzantine flora of\nbrain and complicated deliquescences of language. He desired a\ntroubled indecision on which he might brood until he could shape it at\nwill to a more vague or determinate form, according to the momentary\nstate of his soul. In short, he desired a work of art both for what it\nwas in itself and for what it permitted him to endow it. He wished to\npass by means of it into a sphere of sublimated sensation which would\narouse in him new commotions whose cause he might long and vainly seek\nto analyze.\n\nIn short, since leaving Paris, Des Esseintes was removing himself\nfurther and further from reality, especially from the contemporary\nworld which he held in an ever growing detestation. This hatred had\ninevitably reacted on his literary and artistic tastes, and he would\nhave as little as possible to do with paintings and books whose\nlimited subjects dealt with modern life.\n\nThus, losing the faculty of admiring beauty indiscriminately under\nwhatever form it was presented, he preferred Flaubert's _Tentation de\nsaint Antoine_ to his _Education sentimentale_; Goncourt's _Faustin_\nto his _Germinie Lacerteux_; Zola's _Faute de l'abbe Mouret_ to his\n_Assommoir_.\n\nThis point of view seemed logical to him; these works less immediate,\nbut just as vibrant and human, enabled him to penetrate farther into\nthe depths of the temperaments of these masters who revealed in them\nthe most mysterious transports of their being with a more sincere\nabandon; and they lifted him far above this trivial life which wearied\nhim so.\n\nIn them he entered into a perfect communion of ideas with their\nauthors who had written them when their state of soul was analogous to\nhis own.\n\nIn fact, when the period in which a man of talent is obliged to live\nis dull and stupid, the artist, though unconsciously, is haunted by a\nnostalgia of some past century.\n\nFinding himself unable to harmonize, save at rare intervals, with the\nenvironment in which he lives and not discovering sufficient\ndistraction in the pleasures of observation and analysis, in the\nexamination of the environment and its people, he feels in himself the\ndawning of strange ideas. Confused desires for other lands awake and\nare clarified by reflection and study. Instincts, sensations and\nthoughts bequeathed by heredity, awake, grow fixed, assert themselves\nwith an imperious assurance. He recalls memories of beings and things\nhe has never really known and a time comes when he escapes from the\npenitentiary of his age and roves, in full liberty, into another epoch\nwith which, through a last illusion, he seems more in harmony.\n\nWith some, it is a return to vanished ages, to extinct civilizations,\nto dead epochs; with others, it is an urge towards a fantastic future,\nto a more or less intense vision of a period about to dawn, whose\nimage, by an effect of atavism of which he is unaware, is a\nreproduction of some past age.\n\nIn Flaubert this nostalgia is expressed in solemn and majestic\npictures of magnificent splendors, in whose gorgeous, barbaric frames\nmove palpitating and delicate creatures, mysterious and haughty--women\ngifted, in the perfection of their beauty, with souls capable of\nsuffering and in whose depths he discerned frightful derangements, mad\naspirations, grieved as they were by the haunting premonition of the\ndissillusionments their follies held in store.\n\nThe temperament of this great artist is fully revealed in the\nincomparable pages of the _Tentation de saint Antoine_ and _Salammbo_\nwhere, far from our sorry life, he evokes the splendors of old Asia,\nthe age of fervent prayer and mystic depression, of languorous\npassions and excesses induced by the unbearable ennui resulting from\nopulence and prayer.\n\nIn de Goncourt, it was the nostalgia of the preceding century, a\nreturn to the elegances of a society forever lost. The stupendous\nsetting of seas beating against jetties, of deserts stretching under\ntorrid skies to distant horizons, did not exist in his nostalgic work\nwhich confined itself to a boudoir, near an aulic park, scented with\nthe voluptuous fragrance of a woman with a tired smile, a perverse\nlittle pout and unresigned, pensive eyes. The soul with which he\nanimated his characters was not that breathed by Flaubert into his\ncreatures, no longer the soul early thrown in revolt by the inexorable\ncertainty that no new happiness is possible; it was a soul that had\ntoo late revolted, after the experience, against all the useless\nattempts to invent new spiritual liaisons and to heighten the\nenjoyment of lovers, which from immemorial times has always ended in\nsatiety.\n\nAlthough she lived in, and partook of the life of our time, Faustin,\nby her ancestral influences, was a creature of the past century whose\ncerebral lassitude and sensual excesses she possessed.\n\nThis book of Edmond de Goncourt was one of the volumes which Des\nEsseintes loved best, and the suggestion of revery which he demanded\nlived in this work where, under each written line, another line was\netched, visible to the spirit alone, indicated by a hint which\nrevealed passion, by a reticence permitting one to divine subtle\nstates of soul which no idiom could express. And it was no longer\nFlaubert's language in its inimitable magnificence, but a morbid,\nperspicacious style, nervous and twisted, keen to note the impalpable\nimpression that strikes the senses, a style expert in modulating the\ncomplicated nuances of an epoch which in itself was singularly\ncomplex. In short, it was the epithet indispensable to decrepit\ncivilizations, no matter how old they be, which must have words with\nnew meanings and forms, innovations in phrases and words for their\ncomplex needs.\n\nAt Rome, the dying paganism had modified its prosody and transmuted\nits language with Ausonius, with Claudian and Rutilius whose\nattentive, scrupulous, sonorous and powerful style presented, in its\ndescriptive parts especially, reflections, hints and nuances bearing\nan affinity with the style of de Goncourt.\n\nAt Paris, a fact unique in literary history had been consummated. That\nmoribund society of the eighteenth century, which possessed painters,\nmusicians and architects imbued with its tastes and doctrines, had not\nbeen able to produce a writer who could truly depict its dying\nelegances, the quintessence of its joys so cruelly expiated. It had\nbeen necessary to await the arrival of de Goncourt (whose temperament\nwas formed of memories and regrets made more poignant by the sad\nspectacle of the intellectual poverty and the pitiful aspirations of\nhis own time) to resuscitate, not only in his historical works, but\neven more in _Faustin_, the very soul of that period; incarnating its\nnervous refinements in this actress who tortured her mind and her\nsenses so as to savor to exhaustion the grievous revulsives of love\nand of art.\n\nWith Zola, the nostalgia of the far-away was different. In him was no\nlonging for vanished ages, no aspiring toward worlds lost in the night\nof time. His strong and solid temperament, dazzled with the luxuriance\nof life, its sanguine forces and moral health, diverted him from the\nartificial graces and painted chloroses of the past century, as well\nas from the hierarchic solemnity, the brutal ferocity and misty,\neffeminate dreams of the old orient. When he, too, had become obsessed\nby this nostalgia, by this need, which is nothing less than poetry\nitself, of shunning the contemporary world he was studying, he had\nrushed into an ideal and fruitful country, had dreamed of fantastic\npassions of skies, of long raptures of earth, and of fecund rains of\npollen falling into panting organs of flowers. He had ended in a\ngigantic pantheism, had created, unwittingly perhaps, with this\nEdenesque environment in which he placed his Adam and Eve, a marvelous\nHindoo poem, singing, in a style whose broad, crude strokes had\nsomething of the bizarre brilliance of an Indian painting, the song of\nthe flesh, of animated living matter revealing, to the human creature,\nby its passion for reproduction the forbidden fruits of love, its\nsuffocations, its instinctive caresses and natural attitudes.\n\nWith Baudelaire, these three masters had most affected Des Esseintes\nin modern, French, secular literature. But he had read them so often,\nhad saturated himself in them so completely, that in order to absorb\nthem he had been compelled to lay them aside and let them remain\nunread on his shelves.\n\nEven now when the servant was arranging them for him, he did not care\nto open them, and contented himself merely with indicating the place\nthey were to occupy and seeing that they were properly classified and\nput away.\n\nThe servant brought him a new series of books. These oppressed him\nmore. They were books toward which his taste had gradually veered,\nbooks which diverted him by their very faults from the perfection of\nmore vigorous writers. Here, too, Des Esseintes had reached the point\nwhere he sought, among these troubled pages, only phrases which\ndischarged a sort of electricity that made him tremble; they\ntransmitted their fluid through a medium which at first sight seemed\nrefractory.\n\nTheir imperfections pleased him, provided they were neither parasitic\nnor servile, and perhaps there was a grain of truth in his theory that\nthe inferior and decadent writer, who is more subjective, though\nunfinished, distills a more irritating aperient and acid balm than the\nartist of the same period who is truly great. In his opinion, it was\nin their turbulent sketches that one perceived the exaltations of the\nmost excitable sensibilities, the caprices of the most morbid\npsychological states, the most extravagant depravities of language\ncharged, in spite of its rebelliousness, with the difficult task of\ncontaining the effervescent salts of sensations and ideas.\n\nThus, after the masters, he betook himself to a few writers who\nattracted him all the more because of the disdain in which they were\nheld by the public incapable of understanding them.\n\nOne of them was Paul Verlaine who had begun with a volume of verse,\nthe _Poemes Saturniens_, a rather ineffectual book where imitations of\nLeconte de Lisle jostled with exercises in romantic rhetoric, but\nthrough which already filtered the real personality of the poet in\nsuch poems as the sonnet _Reve Familier_.\n\nIn searching for his antecedents, Des Esseintes discovered, under the\nhesitant strokes of the sketches, a talent already deeply affected by\nBaudelaire, whose influence had been accentuated later on, acquiesced\nin by the peerless master; but the imitation was never flagrant.\n\nAnd in some of his books, _Bonne Chanson_, _Fetes Galantes_, _Romances\nsans paroles_, and his last volume, _Sagesse_, were poems where he\nhimself was revealed as an original and outstanding figure.\n\nWith rhymes obtained from verb tenses, sometimes even from long\nadverbs preceded by a monosyllable from which they fell as from a rock\ninto a heavy cascade of water, his verses, divided by improbable\ncaesuras, often became strangely obscure with their audacious ellipses\nand strange inaccuracies which none the less did not lack grace.\n\nWith his unrivalled ability to handle metre, he had sought to\nrejuvenate the fixed poetic forms. He turned the tail of the sonnet\ninto the air, like those Japanese fish of polychrome clay which rest\non stands, their heads straight down, their tails on top. Sometimes he\ncorrupted it by using only masculine rhymes to which he seemed\npartial. He had often employed a bizarre form--a stanza of three lines\nwhose middle verse was unrhymed, and a tiercet with but one rhyme,\nfollowed by a single line, an echoing refrain like \"Dansons la Gigue\"\nin _Streets_. He had employed other rhymes whose dim echoes are\nrepeated in remote stanzas, like faint reverberations of a bell.\n\nBut his personality expressed itself most of all in vague and\ndelicious confidences breathed in hushed accents, in the twilight. He\nalone had been able to reveal the troubled Ultima Thules of the soul;\nlow whisperings of thoughts, avowals so haltingly and murmuringly\nconfessed that the ear which hears them remains hesitant, passing on\nto the soul languors quickened by the mystery of this suggestion which\nis divined rather than felt. Everything characteristic of Verlaine was\nexpressed in these adorable verses of the _Fetes Galantes_:\n\n    Le soir tombait, un soir equivoque\n      d'automne,\n    Les belles se pendant reveuses a nos\n      bras,\n    Dirent alors des mots si specieux tout\n      bas,\n    Que notre ame depuis ce temps\n      tremble et s'etonne\n\nIt was no longer the immense horizon opened by the unforgettable\nportals of Baudelaire; it was a crevice in the moonlight, opening on a\nfield which was more intimate and more restrained, peculiar to\nVerlaine who had formulated his poetic system in those lines of which\nDes Esseintes was so fond:\n\n    Car nous voulons la nuance encore,\n    Pas la couleur, rien que la nuance.\n    Et tout le reste est litterature.\n\nDes Esseintes had followed him with delight in his most diversified\nworks. After his _Romances sans paroles_ which had appeared in a\njournal, Verlaine had preserved a long silence, reappearing later in\nthose charming verses, hauntingly suggestive of the gentle and cold\naccents of Villon, singing of the Virgin, \"removed from our days of\ncarnal thought and weary flesh.\" Des Esseintes often re-read _Sagesse_\nwhose poems provoked him to secret reveries, a fanciful love for a\nByzantine Madonna who, at a certain moment, changed into a distracted\nmodern Cydalise so mysterious and troubling that one could not know\nwhether she aspired toward depravities so monstrous that they became\nirresistible, or whether she moved in an immaculate dream where the\nadoration of the soul floated around her ever unavowed and ever pure.\n\nThere were other poets, too, who induced him to confide himself to\nthem: Tristan Corbiere who, in 1873, in the midst of the general\napathy had issued a most eccentric volume entitled: _Les Amours\njaunes_. Des Esseintes who, in his hatred of the banal and\ncommonplace, would gladly have accepted the most affected folly and\nthe most singular extravagance, spent many enjoyable hours with this\nwork where drollery mingled with a disordered energy, and where\ndisconcerting lines blazed out of poems so absolutely obscure as the\nlitanies of _Sommeil_, that they qualified their author for the name\nof\n\n    Obscene confesseur des devotes mort-nees.\n\nThe style was hardly French. The author wrote in the negro dialect,\nwas telegraphic in form, suppressed verbs, affected a teasing\nphraseology, revelled in the impossible puns of a travelling salesman;\nthen out of this jumble, laughable conceits and sly affectations\nemerged, and suddenly a cry of keen anguish rang out, like the\nsnapping string of a violoncello. And with all this, in his hard\nrugged style, bristling with obsolescent words and unexpected\nneologisms, flashed perfect originalities, treasures of expression and\nsuperbly nomadic lines amputated of rhyme. Finally, over and above his\n_Poemes Parisiens_, where Des Esseintes had discovered this profound\ndefinition of woman:\n\n    Eternel feminin de l'eternel jocrisse\n\nTristan Corbiere had celebrated in a powerfully concise style, the Sea\nof Brittany, mermaids and the Pardon of Saint Anne. And he had even\nrisen to an eloquence of hate in the insults he hurled, apropos of the\nConlie camp, at the individuals whom he designated under the name of\n\"foreigners of the Fourth of September.\"\n\nThe raciness of which he was so fond, which Corbiere offered him in\nhis sharp epithets, his beauties which ever remained a trifle suspect,\nDes Esseintes found again in another poet, Theodore Hannon, a disciple\nof Baudelaire and Gautier, moved by a very unusual sense of the\nexquisite and the artificial.\n\nUnlike Verlaine whose work was directly influenced by Baudelaire,\nespecially on the psychological side, in his insidious nuances of\nthought and skilful quintessence of sentiment, Theodore Hannon\nespecially descended from the master on the plastic side, by the\nexternal vision of persons and things.\n\nHis charming corruption fatally corresponded to the tendencies of Des\nEsseintes who, on misty or rainy days, enclosed himself in the retreat\nfancied by the poet and intoxicated his eyes with the rustlings of his\nfabrics, with the incandescence of his stones, with his exclusively\nmaterial sumptuousness which ministered to cerebral reactions, and\nrose like a cantharides powder in a cloud of fragrant incense toward a\nBrussel idol with painted face and belly stained by the perfumes.\n\nWith the exception of the works of these poets and of Stephane\nMallarme, which his servant was told to place to one side so that he\nmight classify them separately, Des Esseintes was but slightly\nattracted towards the poets.\n\nNotwithstanding the majestic form and the imposing quality of his\nverse which struck such a brilliant note that even the hexameters of\nHugo seemed pale in comparison, Leconte de Lisle could no longer\nsatisfy him. The antiquity so marvelously restored by Flaubert\nremained cold and immobile in his hands. Nothing palpitated in his\nverses, which lacked depth and which, most often, contained no idea.\nNothing moved in those gloomy, waste poems whose impassive mythologies\nended by finally leaving him cold. Too, after having long delighted in\nGautier, Des Esseintes reached the point where he no longer cared for\nhim. The admiration he felt for this man's incomparable painting had\ngradually dissolved; now he was more astonished than ravished by his\ndescriptions. Objects impressed themselves upon Gautier's perceptive\neyes but they went no further, they never penetrated deeper into his\nbrain and flesh. Like a giant mirror, this writer constantly limited\nhimself to reflecting surrounding objects with impersonal clearness.\nCertainly, Des Esseintes still loved the works of these two poets, as\nhe loved rare stones and precious objects, but none of the variations\nof these perfect instrumentalists could hold him longer, neither being\nevocative of revery, neither opening for him, at least, broad roads of\nescape to beguile the tedium of dragging hours.\n\nThese two books left him unsatisfied. And it was the same with Hugo;\nthe oriental and patriarchal side was too conventional and barren to\ndetain him. And his manners, at once childish and that of a\ngrandfather, exasperated him. He had to go to the _Chansons des rues\net des bois_ to enjoy the perfect acrobatics of his metrics. But how\ngladly, after all, would he not have exchanged all this _tour de\nforce_ for a new work by Baudelaire which might equal the others, for\nhe, decidedly, was almost the only one whose verses, under their\nsplendid form, contained a healing and nutritive substance. In passing\nfrom one extreme to the other, from form deprived of ideas to ideas\ndeprived of form, Des Esseintes remained no less circumspect and cold.\nThe psychological labyrinths of Stendhal, the analytical detours of\nDuranty seduced him, but their administrative, colorless and arid\nlanguage, their static prose, fit at best for the wretched industry of\nthe theatre, repelled him. Then their interesting works and their\nastute analyses applied to brains agitated by passions in which he was\nno longer interested. He was not at all concerned with general\naffections or points of view, with associations of common ideas, now\nthat the reserve of his mind was more keenly developed and that he no\nlonger admitted aught but superfine sensations and catholic or sensual\ntorments. To enjoy a work which should combine, according to his\nwishes, incisive style with penetrating and feline analysis, he had to\ngo to the master of induction, the profound and strange Edgar Allen\nPoe, for whom, since the time when he re-read him, his preference had\nnever wavered.\n\nMore than any other, perhaps, he approached, by his intimate affinity,\nDes Esseintes' meditative cast of mind.\n\nIf Baudelaire, in the hieroglyphics of the soul, had deciphered the\nreturn of the age of sentiment and ideas, Poe, in the field of morbid\npsychology had more especially investigated the domain of the soul.\n\nUnder the emblematic title, _The Demon of Perversity_, he had been the\nfirst in literature to pry into the irresistible, unconscious impulses\nof the will which mental pathology now explains more scientifically.\nHe had also been the first to divulge, if not to signal the impressive\ninfluence of fear which acts on the will like an anaesthetic,\nparalyzing sensibility and like the curare, stupefying the nerves. It\nwas on the problem of the lethargy of the will, that Poe had centered\nhis studies, analyzing the effects of this moral poison, indicating\nthe symptoms of its progress, the troubles commencing with anxiety,\ncontinuing through anguish, ending finally in the terror which deadens\nthe will without intelligence succumbing, though sorely disturbed.\nDeath, which the dramatists had so much abused, he had in some manner\nchanged and made more poignant, by introducing an algebraic and\nsuperhuman element; but in truth, it was less the real agony of the\ndying person which he described and more the moral agony of the\nsurvivor, haunted at the death bed by monstrous hallucinations\nengendered by grief and fatigue. With a frightful fascination, he\ndwelt on acts of terror, on the snapping of the will, coldly reasoning\nabout them, little by little making the reader gasp, suffocated and\npanting before these feverish mechanically contrived nightmares.\n\nConvulsed by hereditary neurosis, maddened by a moral St. Vitus dance,\nPoe's creatures lived only through their nerves; his women, the\nMorellas and Ligeias, possessed an immense erudition. They were\nsteeped in the mists of German philosophy and the cabalistic mysteries\nof the old Orient; and all had the boyish and inert breasts of angels,\nall were sexless.\n\nBaudelaire and Poe, these two men who had often been compared because\nof their common poetic strain and predilection for the examination of\nmental maladies, differed radically in the affective conceptions which\nheld such a large place in their works; Baudelaire with his iniquitous\nand debased loves--cruel loves which made one think of the reprisals\nof an inquisition; Poe with his chaste, aerial loves, in which the\nsenses played no part, where only the mind functioned without\ncorresponding to organs which, if they existed, remained forever\nfrozen and virgin. This cerebral clinic where, vivisecting in a\nstifling atmosphere, that spiritual surgeon became, as soon as his\nattention flagged, a prey to an imagination which evoked, like\ndelicious miasmas, somnambulistic and angelic apparitions, was to Des\nEsseintes a source of unwearying conjecture. But now that his nervous\ndisorders were augmented, days came when his readings broke his spirit\nand when, hands trembling, body alert, like the desolate Usher he was\nhaunted by an unreasoning fear and a secret terror.\n\nThus he was compelled to moderate his desires, and he rarely touched\nthese fearful elixirs, in the same way that he could no longer with\nimpunity visit his red corridor and grow ecstatic at the sight of the\ngloomy Odilon Redon prints and the Jan Luyken horrors. And yet, when\nhe felt inclined to read, all literature seemed to him dull after\nthese terrible American imported philtres. Then he betook himself to\nVilliers de L'Isle Adam in whose scattered works he noted seditious\nobservations and spasmodic vibrations, but which no longer gave one,\nwith the exception of his Claire Lenoir, such troubling horror.\n\nThis Claire Lenoir which appeared in 1867 in the _Revue des lettres et\ndes arts_, opened a series of tales comprised under the title of\n_Histoires Moroses_ where against a background of obscure speculations\nborrowed from old Hegel, dislocated creatures stirred, Dr. Tribulat\nBonhomet, solemn and childish, a Claire Lenoir, farcical and sinister,\nwith blue spectacles, round and large as franc pieces, which covered\nher almost dead eyes.\n\nThis story centered about a simple adultery and ended with an\ninexpressible terror when Bonhomet, opening Claire's eyelids, as she\nlies in her death bed, and penetrating them with monstrous plummets,\ndistinctively perceives the reflection of the husband brandishing the\nlover's decapitated head, while shouting a war song, like a Kanaka.\n\nBased on this more or less just observation that the eyes of certain\nanimals, cows for instance, preserve even to decomposition, like\nphotographic plates, the image of the beings and things their eyes\nbehold at the moment they expire, this story evidently derived from\nPoe, from whom he appropriated the terrifying and elaborate technique.\n\nThis also applied to the _Intersigne_, which had later been joined to\nthe _Contes cruels_, a collection of indisputable talent in which was\nfound _Vera_, which Des Esseintes considered a little masterpiece.\n\nHere, the hallucination was marked with an exquisite tenderness; no\nlonger was it the dark mirages of the American author, but the fluid,\nwarm, almost celestial vision; it was in an identical genre, the\nreverse of the Beatrices and Legeias, those gloomy and dark phantoms\nengendered by the inexorable nightmare of opium.\n\nThis story also put in play the operations of the will, but it no\nlonger treated of its defeats and helplessness under the effects of\nfear; on the contrary, it studied the exaltations of the will under\nthe impulse of a fixed idea; it demonstrated its power which often\nsucceeded in saturating the atmosphere and in imposing its qualities\non surrounding objects.\n\nAnother book by Villiers de L'Isle Adam, _Isis_, seemed to him curious\nin other respects. The philosophic medley of Clair Lenoir was evident\nin this work which offered an unbelievable jumble of verbal and\ntroubled observations, souvenirs of old melodramas, poniards and rope\nladders--all the romanticism which Villiers de L'Isle Adam could never\nrejuvenate in his _Elen_ and _Morgane_, forgotten pieces published by\nan obscure man, Sieur Francisque Guyon.\n\nThe heroine of this book, Marquise Tullia Fabriana, reputed to have\nassimilated the Chaldean science of the women of Edgar Allen Poe, and\nthe diplomatic sagacities of Stendhal, had the enigmatic countenance\nof Bradamante abused by an antique Circe. These insoluble mixtures\ndeveloped a fuliginous vapor across which philosophic and literary\ninfluences jostled, without being able to be regulated in the author's\nbrain when he wrote the prolegomenae of this work which could not have\nembraced less than seven volumes.\n\nBut there was another side to Villiers' temperament. It was piercing\nand acute in an altogether different sense--a side of forbidding\npleasantry and fierce raillery. No longer was it the paradoxical\nmystifications of Poe, but a scoffing that had in it the lugubrious\nand savage comedy which Swift possessed. A series of sketches, _les\nDemoiselles de Bienfilatre_, _l'Affichage celeste_, _la Machine a\ngloire_, and _le Plus beau diner du monde_, betrayed a singularly\ninventive and keenly bantering mind. The whole order of contemporary\nand utilitarian ideas, the whole commercialized baseness of the age\nwere glorified in stories whose poignant irony transported Des\nEsseintes.\n\nNo other French book had been written in this serious and bitter\nstyle. At the most, a tale by Charles Cros, _La science de l'amour_,\nprinted long ago in the _Revue du Monde-Nouveau_, could astonish by\nreason of its chemical whims, by its affected humor and by its coldly\nfacetious observations. But the pleasure to be extracted from the\nstory was merely relative, since its execution was a dismal failure.\nThe firm, colored and often original style of Villiers had disappeared\nto give way to a mixture scraped on the literary bench of the\nfirst-comer.\n\n\"Heavens! heavens! how few books are really worth re-reading,\" sighed\nDes Esseintes, gazing at the servant who left the stool on which he\nhad been perched, to permit Des Esseintes to survey his books with a\nsingle glance.\n\nDes Esseintes nodded his head. But two small books remained on the\ntable. With a sigh, he dismissed the old man, and turned over the\nleaves of a volume bound in onager skin which had been glazed by a\nhydraulic press and speckled with silver clouds. It was held together\nby fly-leaves of old silk damask whose faint patterns held that charm\nof faded things celebrated by Mallarme in an exquisite poem.\n\nThese pages, numbering nine, had been extracted from copies of the two\nfirst Parnassian books; it was printed on parchment paper and preceded\nby this title: _Quelques vers de Mallarme_, designed in a surprising\ncalligraphy in uncial letters, illuminated and relieved with gold, as\nin old manuscripts.\n\nAmong the eleven poems brought together in these covers, several\ninvited him: _Les fenetres_, _l'epilogue_ and _Azur_; but one among\nthem all, a fragment of the _Herodiade_, held him at certain hours in\na spell.\n\nHow often, beneath the lamp that threw a low light on the silent\nchamber, had he not felt himself haunted by this Herodiade who, in the\nwork of Gustave Moreau, was now plunged in gloom revealing but a dim\nwhite statue in a brazier extinguished by stones.\n\nThe darkness concealed the blood, the reflections and the golds, hid\nthe temple's farther sides, drowned the supernumeraries of the crime\nenshrouded in their dead colors, and, only sparing the aquerelle\nwhites, revealed the woman's jewels and heightened her nudity.\n\nAt such times he was forced to gaze upon her unforgotten outlines; and\nshe lived for him, her lips articulating those bizarre and delicate\nlines which Mallarme makes her utter:\n\n                            O miroir!\n    Eau froide par l'ennui dans ton cadre\n      gelee\n    Que de fois, et pendant les heures,\n      desolee\n    Des songes et cherchant mes souvenirs\n      qui sont\n    Comme des feuilles sous ta glace au\n      trou profond,\n    Je m'apparus en toi comme une ombre\n      lointaine!\n    Mais, horreur! des soirs, dans ta\n      severe fontaine,\n    J'ai de mon reve epars connu la nudite!\n\nThese lines he loved, as he loved the works of this poet who, in an\nage of democracy devoted to lucre, lived his solitary and literary\nlife sheltered by his disdain from the encompassing stupidity,\ndelighting, far from society, in the surprises of the intellect, in\ncerebral visions, refining on subtle ideas, grafting Byzantine\ndelicacies upon them, perpetuating them in suggestions lightly\nconnected by an almost imperceptible thread.\n\nThese twisted and precious ideas were bound together with an adhesive\nand secret language full of phrase contractions, ellipses and bold\ntropes.\n\nPerceiving the remotest analogies, with a single term which by an\neffect of similitude at once gave the form, the perfume, the color and\nthe quality, he described the object or being to which otherwise he\nwould have been compelled to place numerous and different epithets so\nas to disengage all their facets and nuances, had he simply contented\nhimself with indicating the technical name. Thus he succeeded in\ndispensing with the comparison, which formed in the reader's mind by\nanalogy as soon as the symbol was understood. Neither was the\nattention of the reader diverted by the enumeration of the qualities\nwhich the juxtaposition of adjectives would have induced.\nConcentrating upon a single word, he produced, as for a picture, the\nensemble, a unique and complete aspect.\n\nIt became a concentrated literature, an essential unity, a sublimate\nof art. This style was at first employed with restraint in his earlier\nworks, but Mallarme had boldly proclaimed it in a verse on Theophile\nGautier and in _l'Apres-midi du faune_, an eclogue where the\nsubtleties of sensual joys are described in mysterious and caressing\nverses suddenly pierced by this wild, rending faun cry:\n\n    Alors m'eveillerai-je a la ferveur\n      premiere,\n    Droit et seul sous un flot antique de\n      lumiere,\n    Lys! et l'un de vous tous pour\n      l'ingenuite.\n\nThat line with the monosyllable _lys_ like a sprig, evoked the image\nof something rigid, slender and white; it rhymed with the substantive\n_ingenuite_, allegorically expressing, by a single term, the passion,\nthe effervescence, the fugitive mood of a virgin faun amorously\ndistracted by the sight of nymphs.\n\nIn this extraordinary poem, surprising and unthought of images leaped\nup at the end of each line, when the poet described the elations and\nregrets of the faun contemplating, at the edge of a fen, the tufts of\nreeds still preserving, in its transitory mould, the form made by the\nnaiades who had occupied it.\n\nThen, Des Esseintes also experienced insidious delights in touching\nthis diminutive book whose cover of Japan vellum, as white as curdled\nmilk, were held together by two silk bands, one of Chinese rose, the\nother of black.\n\nHidden behind the cover, the black band rejoined the rose which rested\nlike a touch of modern Japanese paint or like a lascivious adjutant\nagainst the antique white, against the candid carnation tint of the\nbook, and enlaced it, united its sombre color with the light color\ninto a light rosette. It insinuated a faint warning of that regret, a\nvague menace of that sadness which succeeds the ended transports and\nthe calmed excitements of the senses.\n\nDes Esseintes placed _l'Apres-midi du faune_ on the table and examined\nanother little book he had printed, an anthology of prose poems, a\ntiny chapel, placed under the invocation of Baudelaire and opening on\nthe parvise of his poems.\n\nThis anthology comprised a selection of _Gaspard de la nuit_ of that\nfantastic Aloysius Bertrand who had transferred the behavior of\nLeonard in prose and, with his metallic oxydes, painted little\npictures whose vivid colors sparkle like those of clear enamels. To\nthis, Des Esseintes had joined _le Vox populi_ of Villiers, a superb\npiece of work in a hammered, golden style after the manner of Leconte\nde Lisle and of Flaubert, and some selections from that delicate\n_livre de Jade_ whose exotic perfume of ginseng and of tea blends with\nthe odorous freshness of water babbling along the book, under\nmoonlight.\n\nBut in this collection had been gathered certain poems resurrected\nfrom defunct reviews: _le Demon de l'analogie_, _la Pipe_, _le Pauvre\nenfant pale_, _le Spectacle interrompu_, _le Phenomene futur_, and\nespecially _Plaintes d'automne_ and _Frisson d'hiver_ which were\nMallarme's masterpieces and were also celebrated among the\nmasterpieces of prose poems, for they united such a magnificently\ndelicate language that they cradled, like a melancholy incantation or\na maddening melody, thoughts of an irresistible suggestiveness,\npulsations of the soul of a sensitive person whose excited nerves\nvibrate with a keenness which penetrates ravishingly and induces a\nsadness.\n\nOf all the forms of literature, that of the prose poem was the form\nDes Esseintes preferred. Handled by an alchemist of genius, it\ncontained in its slender volume the strength of the novel whose\nanalytic developments and descriptive redundancies it suppressed.\nQuite often, Des Esseintes had meditated on that disquieting\nproblem--to write a novel concentrated in a few phrases which should\ncontain the essence of hundreds of pages always employed to establish\nthe setting, to sketch the characters, and to pile up observations and\nminute details. Then the chosen words would be so unexchangeable that\nthey would do duty for many others, the adjective placed in such an\ningenious and definite fashion that it could not be displaced, opening\nsuch perspectives that the reader could dream for whole weeks on its\nsense at once precise and complex, could record the present,\nreconstruct the past, divine the future of the souls of the\ncharacters, revealed by the gleams of this unique epithet.\n\nThus conceived and condensed in a page or two, the novel could become\na communion of thought between a magical writer and an ideal reader, a\nspiritual collaboration agreed to between ten superior persons\nscattered throughout the universe, a delight offered to the refined,\nand accessible to them alone.\n\nTo Des Esseintes, the prose poem represented the concrete juice of\nliterature, the essential oil of art.\n\nThat succulence, developed and concentrated into a drop, already\nexisted in Baudelaire and in those poems of Mallarme which he read\nwith such deep joy.\n\nWhen he had closed his anthology, Des Esseintes told himself that his\nbooks which had ended on this last book, would probably never have\nanything added to it.\n\nIn fact, the decadence of a literature, irreparably affected in its\norganism, enfeebled by old ideas, exhausted by excesses of syntax,\nsensitive only to the curiosities which make sick persons feverish,\nand yet intent upon expressing everything in its decline, eager to\nrepair all the omissions of enjoyment, to bequeath the most subtle\nmemories of grief in its death bed, was incarnate in Mallarme, in the\nmost perfect exquisite manner imaginable.\n\nHere were the quintessences of Baudelaire and of Poe; here were their\nfine and powerful substances distilled and disengaging new flavors and\nintoxications.\n\nIt was the agony of the old language which, after having become moldy\nfrom age to age, ended by dissolving, by reaching that deliquescence\nof the Latin language which expired in the mysterious concepts and the\nenigmatical expressions of Saint Boniface and Saint Adhelme.\n\nThe decomposition of the French language had been effected suddenly.\nIn the Latin language, a long transition, a distance of four hundred\nyears existed between the spotted and superb epithet of Claudian and\nRutilius and the gamy epithet of the eighth century. In the French\nlanguage, no lapse of time, no succession of ages had taken place; the\nstained and superb style of the de Goncourts and the gamy style of\nVerlaine and Mallarme jostled in Paris, living in the same period,\nepoch and century.\n\nAnd Des Esseintes, gazing at one of the folios opened on his chapel\ndesk, smiled at the thought that the moment would soon come when an\nerudite scholar would prepare for the decadence of the French language\na glossary similar to that in which the savant, Du Cange, has noted\nthe last murmurings, the last spasms, the last flashes of the Latin\nlanguage dying of old age in the cloisters and sounding its death\nrattle.\n\n\n\n\n    Chapter 15\n\n\nBurning at first like a rick on fire, his enthusiasm for the digester\nas quickly died out. Torpid at first, his nervous dyspepsia\nreappeared, and then this hot essence induced such an irritation in\nhis stomach that Des Esseintes was quickly compelled to stop using it.\n\nThe malady increased in strength; peculiar symptoms attended it. After\nthe nightmares, hallucinations of smell, pains in the eye and deep\ncoughing which recurred with clock-like regularity, after the pounding\nof his heart and arteries and the cold perspiration, arose illusions\nof hearing, those alterations which only reveal themselves in the last\nperiod of sickness.\n\nAttacked by a strong fever, Des Esseintes suddenly heard murmurings of\nwater; then those sounds united into one and resembled a roaring which\nincreased and then slowly resolved itself into a silvery bell sound.\n\nHe felt his delirious brain whirling in musical waves, engulfed in the\nmystic whirlwinds of his infancy. The songs learned at the Jesuits\nreappeared, bringing with them pictures of the school and the chapel\nwhere they had resounded, driving their hallucinations to the\nolfactory and visual organs, veiling them with clouds of incense and\nthe pallid light irradiating through the stained-glass windows, under\nthe lofty arches.\n\nAt the Fathers, the religious ceremonies had been practiced with great\npomp. An excellent organist and remarkable singing director made an\nartistic delight of these spiritual exercises that were conducive to\nworship. The organist was in love with the old masters and on holidays\ncelebrated masses by Palestrina and Orlando Lasso, psalms by Marcello,\noratorios by Handel, motets by Bach; he preferred to render the sweet\nand facile compilations of Father Lambillotte so much favored by\npriests, the \"Laudi Spirituali\" of the sixteenth century whose\nsacerdotal beauty had often bewitched Des Esseintes.\n\nBut he particularly extracted ineffable pleasures while listening to\nthe plain-chant which the organist had preserved regardless of new\nideas.\n\nThat form which was now considered a decrepit and Gothic form of\nChristian liturgy, an archaeological curiosity, a relic of ancient\ntime, had been the voice of the early Church, the soul of the Middle\nAge. It was the eternal prayer that had been sung and modulated in\nharmony with the soul's transports, the enduring hymn uplifted for\ncenturies to the Almighty.\n\nThat traditional melody was the only one which, with its strong\nunison, its solemn and massive harmonies, like freestone, was not out\nof place with the old basilicas, making eloquent the Romanesque\nvaults, whose emanation and very spirit they seemed to be.\n\nHow often had Des Esseintes not thrilled under its spell, when the\n\"Christus factus est\" of the Gregorian chant rose from the nave whose\npillars seemed to tremble among the rolling clouds from censers, or\nwhen the \"De Profundis\" was sung, sad and mournful as a suppressed\nsob, poignant as a despairing invocation of humanity bewailing its\nmortal destiny and imploring the tender forgiveness of its Savior!\n\nAll religious music seemed profane to him compared with that\nmagnificent chant created by the genius of the Church, anonymous as\nthe organ whose inventor is unknown. At bottom, in the works of\nJomelli and Porpora, Carissimi and Durante, in the most wonderful\ncompositions of Handel and Bach, there was never a hint of a\nrenunciation of public success, or the sacrifice of an effect of art,\nor the abdication of human pride hearkening to its own prayer.\n\nAt the most, the religious style, august and solemn, had crystallized\nin Lesueur's imposing masses celebrated at Saint-Roch, tending to\napproach the severe nudity and austere majesty of the old plain-chant.\n\nSince then, absolutely revolted by these pretexts at _Stabat Maters_\ndevised by the Pergolesis and the Rossinis, by this intrusion of\nprofane art in liturgic art, Des Esseintes had shunned those ambiguous\nworks tolerated by the indulgent Church.\n\nIn addition, this weakness brought about by the desire for large\ncongregations had quickly resulted in the adoption of songs borrowed\nfrom Italian operas, of low cavatinas and indecent quadrilles played\nin churches converted to boudoirs and surrendered to stage actors\nwhose voices resounded aloft, their impurity tainting the tones of the\nholy organ.\n\nFor years he had obstinately refused to take part in these pious\nentertainments, contenting himself with his memories of childhood. He\neven regretted having heard the _Te Deum_ of the great masters, for he\nremembered that admirable plain-chant, that hymn so simple and solemn\ncomposed by some unknown saint, a Saint Ambrose or Hilary who, lacking\nthe complicated resources of an orchestra and the musical mechanics of\nmodern science, revealed an ardent faith, a delirious jubilation,\nuttered, from the soul of humanity, in the piercing and almost\ncelestial accents of conviction.\n\nDes Esseintes' ideas on music were in flagrant contradiction with the\ntheories he professed regarding the other arts. In religious music, he\napproved only of the monastic music of the Middle Ages, that emaciated\nmusic which instinctively reacted on his nerves like certain pages of\nthe old Christian Latin. Then (he freely confessed it) he was\nincapable of understanding the tricks that the contemporary masters\nhad introduced into Catholic art. And he had not studied music with\nthat passion which had led him towards painting and letters. He played\nindifferently on the piano and after many painful attempts had\nsucceeded in reading a score, but he was ignorant of harmony, of the\ntechnique needed really to understand a nuance, to appreciate a\nfinesse, to savor a refinement with full comprehension.\n\nIn other respects, when not read in solitude, profane music is a\npromiscuous art. To enjoy music, one must become part of that public\nwhich fills the theatres where, in a vile atmosphere, one perceives a\nloutish-looking man butchering episodes from Wagner, to the huge\ndelight of the ignorant mob.\n\nHe had always lacked the courage to plunge in this mob-bath so as to\nlisten to Berlioz' compositions, several fragments of which had\nbewitched him by their passionate exaltations and their vigorous\nfugues, and he was certain that there was not one single scene, not\neven a phrase of one of the operas of the amazing Wagner which could\nwith impunity be detached from its whole.\n\nThe fragments, cut and served on the plate of a concert, lost all\nsignificance and remained senseless, since (like the chapters of a\nbook, completing each other and moving to an inevitable conclusion)\nWagner's melodies were necessary to sketch the characters, to\nincarnate their thoughts and to express their apparent or secret\nmotives. He knew that their ingenious and persistent returns were\nunderstood only by the auditors who followed the subject from the\nbeginning and gradually beheld the characters in relief, in a setting\nfrom which they could not be removed without dying, like branches torn\nfrom a tree.\n\nThat was why he felt that, among the vulgar herd of melomaniacs\nenthusing each Sunday on benches, scarcely any knew the score that was\nbeing massacred, when the ushers consented to be silent and permit the\norchestra to be heard.\n\nGranted also that intelligent patriotism forbade a French theatre to\ngive a Wagnerian opera, the only thing left to the curious who know\nnothing of musical arcana and either cannot or will not betake\nthemselves to Bayreuth, is to remain at home. And that was precisely\nthe course of conduct he had pursued.\n\nThe more public and facile music and the independent pieces of the old\noperas hardly interested him; the wretched trills of Auber and\nBoieldieu, of Adam and Flotow and the rhetorical commonplaces of\nAmbroise Thomas and the Bazins disgusted him as did the superannuated\naffectations and vulgar graces of Italians. That was why he had\nresolutely broken with musical art, and during the years of his\nabstention, he pleasurably recalled only certain programs of chamber\nmusic when he had heard Beethoven, and especially Schumann and\nSchubert which had affected his nerves in the same manner as had the\nmore intimate and troubling poems of Edgar Allen Poe.\n\nSome of Schubert's parts for violoncello had positively left him\npanting, in the grip of hysteria. But it was particularly Schubert's\nlieders that had immeasurably excited him, causing him to experience\nsimilar sensations as after a waste of nervous fluid, or a mystic\ndissipation of the soul.\n\nThis music penetrated and drove back an infinity of forgotten\nsufferings and spleen in his heart. He was astonished at being able to\ncontain so many dim miseries and vague griefs. This desolate music,\ncrying from the inmost depths, terrified while charming him. Never\ncould he repeat the \"Young Girl's Lament\" without a welling of tears\nin his eyes, for in this plaint resided something beyond a mere\nbroken-hearted state; something in it clutched him, something like a\nromance ending in a gloomy landscape.\n\nAnd always, when these exquisite, sad plaints returned to his lips,\nthere was evoked for him a suburban, flinty and gloomy site where a\nsuccession of silent bent persons, harassed by life, filed past into\nthe twilight, while, steeped in bitterness and overflowing with\ndisgust, he felt himself solitary in this dejected landscape, struck\nby an inexpressibly melancholy and stubborn distress whose mysterious\nintensity excluded all consolation, pity and repose. Like a\nfuneral-knell, this despairing chant haunted him, now that he was in\nbed, prostrated by fever and agitated by an anxiety so much the more\ninappeasable for the fact that he could not discover its cause. He\nended by abandoning himself to the torrent of anguishes suddenly\ndammed by the chant of psalms slowly rising in his tortured head.\n\nOne morning, nevertheless, he felt more tranquil and requested the\nservant to bring a looking-glass. It fell from his hands. He hardly\nrecognized himself. His face was a clay color, the lips bloated and\ndry, the tongue parched, the skin rough. His hair and beard, untended\nsince his illness by the domestic, added to the horror of the sunken\nface and staring eyes burning with feverish intensity in this skeleton\nhead that bristled with hair. More than his weakness, more than his\nvomitings which began with each attempt at taking nourishment, more\nthan his emaciation, did his changed visage terrify him. He felt lost.\nThen, in the dejection which overcame him, a sudden energy forced him\nin a sitting posture. He had strength to write a letter to his Paris\nphysician and to order the servant to depart instantly, seek and bring\nhim back that very day.\n\nHe passed suddenly from complete depression into boundless hope. This\nphysician was a celebrated specialist, a doctor renowned for his cures\nof nervous maladies \"He must have cured many more dangerous cases than\nmine,\" Des Esseintes reflected. \"I shall certainly be on my feet in a\nfew days.\" Disenchantment succeeded his confidence. Learned and\nintuitive though they be, physicians know absolutely nothing of\nneurotic diseases, being ignorant of their origins. Like the others,\nthis one would prescribe the eternal oxyde of zinc and quinine,\nbromide of potassium and valerian. He had recourse to another thought:\n\"If these remedies have availed me little in the past, could it not be\ndue to the fact that I have not taken the right quantities?\"\n\nIn spite of everything, this expectation of being cured cheered him,\nbut then a new fear entered. His servant might have failed to find the\nphysician. Again he grew faint, passing instantly from the most\nunreasoning hopes to the most baseless fears, exaggerating the chances\nof a sudden recovery and his apprehensions of danger. The hours passed\nand the moment came when, in utter despair and convinced that the\nphysician would not arrive, he angrily told himself that he certainly\nwould have been saved, had he acted sooner. Then his rage against the\nservant and the physician whom he accused of permitting him to die,\nvanished, and he ended by reproaching himself for having waited so\nlong before seeking aid, persuading himself that he would now be\nwholly cured had he that very last evening used the medicine.\n\nLittle by little, these alternations of hope and alarms jostling in\nhis poor head, abated. The struggles ended by crushing him, and he\nrelapsed into exhausted sleep interrupted by incoherent dreams, a sort\nof syncope pierced by awakenings in which he was barely conscious of\nanything. He had reached such a state where he lost all idea of\ndesires and fears, and he was stupefied, experiencing neither\nastonishment or joy, when the physician suddenly arrived.\n\nThe doctor had doubtless been apprised by the servant of Des\nEsseintes' mode of living and of the various symptoms observed since\nthe day when the master of the house had been found near the window,\noverwhelmed by the violence of perfumes. He put very few questions to\nthe patient whom he had known for many years. He felt his pulse and\nattentively studied the urine where certain white spots revealed one\nof the determining causes of nervousness. He wrote a prescription and\nleft without saying more than that he would soon return.\n\nThis visit comforted Des Esseintes who none the less was frightened by\nthe taciturnity observed; he adjured his servant not to conceal the\ntruth from him any longer. But the servant declared that the doctor\nhad exhibited no uneasiness, and despite his suspicions, Des Esseintes\ncould seize upon no sign that might betray a shadow of a lie on the\ntranquil countenance of the old man.\n\nThen his thoughts began to obsess him less; his suffering disappeared\nand to the exhaustion he had felt throughout his members was grafted a\ncertain indescribable languor. He was astonished and satisfied not to\nbe weighted with drugs and vials, and a faint smile played on his lips\nwhen the servant brought a nourishing injection of peptone and told\nhim he was to take it three times every twenty-four hours.\n\nThe operation succeeded and Des Esseintes could not forbear to\ncongratulate himself on this event which in a manner crowned the\nexistence he had created. His penchant towards the artificial had now,\nthough involuntarily, reached the supreme goal.\n\nFarther one could not go. The nourishment thus absorbed was the\nultimate deviation one could possibly commit.\n\n\"How delicious it would be\" he reflected, \"to continue this simple\nregime in complete health! What economy of time, what a pronounced\ndeliverance from the aversion which food gives those who lack\nappetite! What a complete riddance from the disgust induced by food\nforcibly eaten! What an energetic protestation against the vile sin of\ngluttony, what a positive insult hurled at old nature whose monotonous\ndemands would thus be avoided.\"\n\nAnd he continued, talking to himself half-aloud. One could easily\nstimulate desire for food by swallowing a strong aperitif. After the\nquestion, \"what time is it getting to be? I am famished,\" one would\nmove to the table and place the instrument on the cloth, and then, in\nthe time it takes to say grace, one could have suppressed the tiresome\nand vulgar demands of the body.\n\nSeveral days afterwards, the servant presented an injection whose\ncolor and odor differed from the other.\n\n\"But it is not the same at all!\" Des Esseintes cried, gazing with deep\nfeeling at the liquid poured into the apparatus. As if in a\nrestaurant, he asked for the card, and unfolding the physician's\nprescription, read:\n\n    Cod Liver Oil . . . . . . . .  20 grammes\n    Beef Tea  . . . . . . . . . . 200 grammes\n    Burgundy Wine . . . . . . . . 200 grammes\n    Yolk of one egg.\n\nHe remained meditative. He who by reason of the weakened state of his\nstomach had never seriously preoccupied himself with the art of the\ncuisine, was surprised to find himself thinking of combinations to\nplease an artificial epicure. Then a strange idea crossed his brain.\nPerhaps the physician had imagined that the strange palate of his\npatient was fatigued by the taste of the peptone; perhaps he had\nwished, like a clever chef, to vary the taste of foods and to prevent\nthe monotony of dishes that might lead to want of appetite. Once in\nthe wake of these reflections, Des Esseintes sketched new recipes,\npreparing vegetable dinners for Fridays, using the dose of cod liver\noil and wine, dismissing the beef tea as a meat food specially\nprohibited by the Church. But he had no occasion longer to ruminate on\nthese nourishing drinks, for the physician succeeded gradually in\ncuring the vomiting attacks, and he was soon swallowing, in the normal\nmanner, a syrup of punch containing a pulverized meat whose faint\naroma of cacao pleased his palate.\n\nWeeks passed before his stomach decided to function. The nausea\nreturned at certain moments, but these attacks were disposed of by\nginger ale and Rivieres' antiemetic drink.\n\nFinally the organs were restored. Meats were digested with the aid of\npepsines. Recovering strength, he was able to stand up and attempt to\nwalk, leaning on a cane and supporting himself on the furniture.\nInstead of being thankful over his success, he forgot his past pains,\ngrew irritated at the length of time needed for convalescence and\nreproached the doctor for not effecting a more rapid cure.\n\nAt last the day came when he could remain standing for whole\nafternoons. Then his study irritated him. Certain blemishes it\npossessed, and which habit had accustomed him to overlook, now were\napparent. The colors chosen to be seen by lamp-light seemed discordant\nin full day. He thought of changing them and for whole hours he\ncombined rebellious harmonies of hues, hybrid pairings of cloth and\nleathers.\n\n\"I am certainly on the road to recovery,\" he reflected, taking note of\nhis old hobbies.\n\nOne morning, while contemplating his orange and blue walls,\nconsidering some ideal tapestries worked with stoles of the Greek\nChurch, dreaming of Russian orphrey dalmaticas and brocaded copes\nflowered with Slavonic letters done in Ural stones and rows of pearls,\nthe physician entered and, noticing the patient's eyes, questioned\nhim.\n\nDes Esseintes spoke of his unrealizable longings. He commenced to\ncontrive new color schemes, to talk of harmonies and discords of tones\nhe meant to produce, when the doctor stunned him by peremptorily\nannouncing that these projects would never be executed here.\n\nAnd, without giving him time to catch breath, he informed Des\nEsseintes that he had done his utmost in re-establishing the digestive\nfunctions and that now it was necessary to attack the neurosis which\nwas by no means cured and which would necessitate years of diet and\ncare. He added that before attempting a cure, before commencing any\nhydrotherapic treatment, impossible of execution at Fontenay, Des\nEsseintes must quit that solitude, return to Paris, and live an\nordinary mode of existence by amusing himself like others.\n\n\"But the pleasures of others will not amuse me,\" Des Esseintes\nindignantly cried.\n\nWithout debating the matter, the doctor merely asserted that this\nradical change was, in his eyes, a question of life or death, a\nquestion of health or insanity possibly complicated in the near future\nby tuberculosis.\n\n\"So it is a choice between death and the hulks!\" Des Esseintes\nexasperatedly exclaimed.\n\nThe doctor, who was imbued with all the prejudices of a man of the\nworld, smiled and reached the door without saying a word.\n\n\n\n\n    Chapter 16\n\n\nDes Esseintes locked himself up in his bedroom, closing his ears to\nthe sounds of hammers on packing cases. Each stroke rent his heart,\ndrove a sorrow into his flesh. The physician's order was being\nfulfilled; the fear of once more submitting to the pains he had\nendured, the fear of a frightful agony had acted more powerfully on\nDes Esseintes than the hatred of the detestable existence to which the\nmedical order condemned him.\n\nYet he told himself there were people who live without conversing with\nanyone, absorbed far from the world in their own affairs, like\nrecluses and trappists, and there is nothing to prove that these\nwretches and sages become madmen or consumptives. He had\nunsuccessfully cited these examples to the doctor; the latter had\nrepeated, coldly and firmly, in a tone that admitted of no reply, that\nhis verdict, (confirmed besides by consultation with all the experts\non neurosis) was that distraction, amusement, pleasure alone might\nmake an impression on this malady whose spiritual side eluded all\nremedy; and made impatient by the recriminations of his patient, he\nfor the last time declared that he would refuse to continue treating\nhim if he did not consent to a change of air, and live under new\nhygienic conditions.\n\nDes Esseintes had instantly betaken himself to Paris, had consulted\nother specialists, had impartially put the case before them. All\nhaving unhesitatingly approved of the action of their colleague, he\nhad rented an apartment in a new house, had returned to Fontenay and,\nwhite with rage, had given orders to have his trunks packed.\n\nSunk in his easy chair, he now ruminated upon that unyielding order\nwhich was wrecking his plans, breaking the strings of his present life\nand overturning his future plans. His beatitude was ended. He was\ncompelled to abandon this sheltering haven and return at full speed\ninto the stupidity which had once attacked him.\n\nThe physicians spoke of amusement and distraction. With whom, and with\nwhat did they wish him to distract and amuse himself?\n\nHad he not banished himself from society? Did he know a single person\nwhose existence would approximate his in seclusion and contemplation?\nDid he know a man capable of appreciating the fineness of a phrase,\nthe subtlety of a painting, the quintessence of an idea,--a man whose\nsoul was delicate and exquisite enough to understand Mallarme and love\nVerlaine?\n\nWhere and when must he search to discover a twin spirit, a soul\ndetached from commonplaces, blessing silence as a benefit, ingratitude\nas a solace, contempt as a refuge and port?\n\nIn the world where he had dwelt before his departure for Fontenay? But\nmost of the county squires he had associated with must since have\nstultified themselves near card tables or ended upon the lips of\nwomen; most by this time must have married; after having enjoyed,\nduring their life, the spoils of cads, their spouses now possessed the\nremains of strumpets, for, master of first-fruits, the people alone\nwaste nothing.\n\n\"A pretty change--this custom adopted by a prudish society!\" Des\nEsseintes reflected.\n\nThe nobility had died, the aristocracy had marched to imbecility or\nordure! It was extinguished in the corruption of its descendants whose\nfaculties grew weaker with each generation and ended in the instincts\nof gorillas fermented in the brains of grooms and jockeys; or rather,\nas with the Choiseul-Praslins, Polignacs and Chevreuses, wallowed in\nthe mud of lawsuits which made it equal the other classes in\nturpitude.\n\nThe mansions themselves, the secular escutcheons, the heraldic\ndeportment of this antique caste had disappeared. The land no longer\nyielding anything was put up for sale, money being needed to procure\nthe venereal witchcraft for the besotted descendants of the old races.\n\nThe less scrupulous and stupid threw aside all sense of shame. They\nweltered in the mire of fraud and deceit, behaved like cheap sharpers.\n\nThis eagerness for gain, this lust for lucre had even reacted on that\nother class which had constantly supported itself on the nobility--the\nclergy. Now one perceived, in newspapers, announcements of corn cures\nby priests. The monasteries had changed into apothecary or liqueur\nworkrooms. They sold recipes or manufactured products: the Citeaux\norder, chocolate; the trappists, semolina; the Maristes Brothers,\nbiphosphate of medicinal lime and arquebuse water; the jacobins, an\nanti-apoplectic elixir; the disciples of Saint Benoit, benedictine;\nthe friars of Saint Bruno, chartreuse.\n\nBusiness had invaded the cloisters where, in place of antiphonaries,\nheavy ledgers reposed on reading-desks. Like leprosy, the avidity of\nthe age was ravaging the Church, weighing down the monks with\ninventories and invoices.\n\nAnd yet, in spite of everything, it was only among the ecclesiastics\nthat Des Esseintes could hope for pleasurable contract. In the society\nof well-bred and learned canons, he would have been compelled to share\ntheir faith, to refrain from floating between sceptical ideas and\ntransports of conviction which rose from time to time on the water,\nsustained by recollections of childhood.\n\nHe would have had to muster identical opinions and never admit (he\nfreely did in his ardent moments) a Catholicism charged with a soupcon\nof magic, as under Henry the Third, and with a dash of sadism, as at\nthe end of the last century. This special clericalism, this depraved\nand artistically perverse mysticism towards which he wended could not\neven be discussed with a priest who would not have understood them or\nwho would have banished them with horror.\n\nFor the twentieth time, this irresolvable problem troubled him. He\nwould have desired an end to this irresolute state in which he\nfloundered. Now that he was pursuing a changed life, he would have\nliked to possess faith, to incrust it as soon as seized, to screw it\ninto his soul, to shield it finally from all those reflections which\nuprooted and agitated it. But the more he desired it and the less his\nemptiness of spirit was evident, the more Christ's visitation receded.\nAs his religious hunger augmented and he gazed eagerly at this faith\nvisible but so far off that the distance terrified him, ideas pressed\nupon his active mind, driving back his will, rejecting, by common\nsense and mathematical proofs, the mysteries and dogmas. He sadly told\nhimself that he would have to find a way to abstain from\nself-discussion. He would have to learn how to close his eyes and let\nhimself be swept along by the current, forgetting those accursed\ndiscoveries which have destroyed the religious edifice, from top to\nbottom, since the last two centuries.\n\nHe sighed. It is neither the physiologists nor the infidels that\ndemolish Catholicism, but the priests, whose stupid works could\nextirpate convictions the most steadfast.\n\nA Dominican friar, Rouard de Card, had proved in a brochure entitled\n\"On the Adulteration of Sacramental Substances\" that most masses were\nnot valid, because the elements used for worship had been adulterated\nby the manufacturers.\n\nFor years, the holy oils had been adulterated with chicken fat; wax,\nwith burned bones; incense, with cheap resin and benzoin. But the\nthing that was worse was that the substances, indispensable to the\nholy sacrifice, the two substances without which no oblation is\npossible, had also been debased: the wine, by numerous dilutions and\nby illicit introductions of Pernambuco wood, danewort berries, alcohol\nand alum; the bread of the Eucharist that must be kneaded with the\nfine flour of wheat, by kidney beans, potash and pipe clay.\n\nBut they had gone even farther. They had dared suppress the wheat and\nshameless dealers were making almost all the Host with the fecula of\npotatoes.\n\nNow, God refused to descend into the fecula. It was an undeniable fact\nand a certain one. In the second volume of his treatise on moral\ntheology, Cardinal Gousset had dwelt at length on this question of the\nfraud practiced from the divine point of view. And, according to the\nincontestable authority of this master, one could not consecrate bread\nmade of flour of oats, buckwheat or barley, and if the matter of using\nrye be less doubtful, no argument was possible in regard to the fecula\nwhich, according to the ecclesiastic expression, was in no way fit for\nsacramental purposes.\n\nBy means of the rapid manipulation of the fecula and the beautiful\nappearance presented by the unleavened breads created with this\nelement, the shameless imposture had been so propagated that now the\nmystery of the transubstantiation hardly existed any longer and the\npriests and faithful were holding communion, without being aware of\nit, with neutral elements.\n\nAh! far off was the time when Radegonda, Queen of France, had with her\nown hands prepared the bread destined for the alters, or the time\nwhen, after the customs of Cluny, three priests or deacons, fasting\nand garbed in alb and amice, washed their faces and hands and then\npicked out the wheat, grain by grain, grinding it under millstone,\nkneading the paste in a cold and pure water and themselves baking it\nunder a clear fire, while chanting psalms.\n\n\"All this matter of eternal dupery,\" Des Esseintes reflected, \"is not\nconducive to the steadying of my already weakened faith. And how admit\nthat omnipotence which stops at such a trifle as a pinch of fecula or\na soupcon of alcohol?\"\n\nThese reflections all the more threw a gloom over the view of his\nfuture life and rendered his horizon more menacing and dark.\n\nHe was lost, utterly lost. What would become of him in this Paris\nwhere he had neither family nor friends? No bond united him to the\nSaint-Germain quarters now in its dotage, scaling into the dust of\ndesuetude, buried in a new society like an empty husk. And what\ncontact could exist between him and that bourgeois class which had\ngradually climbed up, profiting by all the disasters to grow rich,\nmaking use of all the catastrophes to impose respect on its crimes and\nthefts.\n\nAfter the aristocracy of birth had come the aristocracy of money. Now\none saw the reign of the caliphates of commerce, the despotism of the\nrue du Sentier, the tyranny of trade, bringing in its train venal\nnarrow ideas, knavish and vain instincts.\n\nViler and more dishonest than the nobility despoiled and the decayed\nclergy, the bourgeoisie borrowed their frivolous ostentations, their\nbraggadoccio, degrading these qualities by its lack of _savoir-vivre_;\nthe bourgeoisie stole their faults and converted them into\nhypocritical vices. And, authoritative and sly, low and cowardly, it\npitilessly attacked its eternal and necessary dupe, the populace,\nunmuzzled and placed in ambush so as to be in readiness to assault the\nold castes.\n\nIt was now an acknowledged fact. Its task once terminated, the\nproletariat had been bled, supposedly as a measure of hygiene. The\nbourgeoisie, reassured, strutted about in good humor, thanks to its\nwealth and the contagion of its stupidity. The result of its accession\nto power had been the destruction of all intelligence, the negation of\nall honesty, the death of all art, and, in fact, the debased artists\nhad fallen on their knees, and they eagerly kissed the dirty feet of\nthe eminent jobbers and low satraps whose alms permitted them to live.\n\nIn painting, one now beheld a deluge of silliness; in literature, an\nintemperate mixture of dull style and cowardly ideas, for they had to\ncredit the business man with honesty, the buccaneer who purchased a\ndot for his son and refused to pay that of his daughter, with virtue;\nchaste love to the Voltairian agnostic who accused the clergy of rapes\nand then went hypocritically and stupidly to sniff, in the obscene\nchambers.\n\nIt was the great American hulks transported to our continent. It was\nthe immense, the profound, the incommensurable peasantry of the\nfinancier and the parvenu, beaming, like a pitiful sun, upon the\nidolatrous town which wallowed on the ground the while it uttered\nimpure psalms before the impious tabernacle of banks.\n\n\"Well, then, society, crash to ruin! Die, aged world!\" cried Des\nEsseintes, angered by the ignominy of the spectacle he had evoked.\nThis cry of hate broke the nightmare that oppressed him.\n\n\"Ah!\" he exclaimed, \"To think that all this is not a dream, to think\nthat I am going to return into the cowardly and servile crowd of this\ncentury!\" To console himself, he recalled the comforting maxims of\nSchopenhauer, and repeated to himself the sad axiom of Pascal: \"The\nsoul is pained by all things it thinks upon.\" But the words resounded\nin his mind like sounds deprived of sense; his ennui disintegrated,\nlifting all significance from the words, all healing virtue, all\neffective and gentle vigor.\n\nHe came at last to perceive that the reasonings of pessimism availed\nlittle in comforting him, that impossible faith in a future life alone\nwould pacify him.\n\nAn access of rage swept aside, like a hurricane, his attempts at\nresignation and indifference. He could no longer conceal the hideous\ntruth--nothing was left, all was in ruins. The bourgeoisie were\ngormandizing on the solemn ruins of the Church which had become a\nplace of rendez-vous, a mass of rubbish, soiled by petty puns and\nscandalous jests. Were the terrible God of Genesis and the Pale Christ\nof Golgotha not going to prove their existence by commanding the\ncataclysms of yore, by rekindling the flames that once consumed the\nsinful cities? Was this degradation to continue to flow and cover with\nits pestilence the old world planted with seeds of iniquities and\nshames?\n\nThe door was suddenly opened. Clean-shaved men appeared, bringing\nchests and carrying the furniture; then the door closed once more on\nthe servant who was removing packages of books.\n\nDes Esseintes sank into a chair.\n\n\"I shall be in Paris in two days. Well, all is finished. The waves of\nhuman mediocrity rise to the sky and they will engulf the refuge whose\ndams I open. Ah! courage leaves me, my heart breaks! O Lord, pity the\nChristian who doubts, the sceptic who would believe, the convict of\nlife embarking alone in the night, under a sky no longer illumined by\nthe consoling beacons of ancient faith.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Against The Grain, by Joris-Karl Huysmans\n\n[Transcriber's Note, to forestall future queries:\n\nThis translation, as printed, omits two sections: chapter 6 entirely,\nand a few paragraphs near the end of chapter 9 (totalling 2500 words,\nor about 4%). \n\nIn chapter 6, Des Esseintes is relaxing in a wing-chair in front of\nthe fire, remembering an event. One evening in the Rue de Rivoli he\nhad befriended a young man, taken him to an expensive brothel, and\npaid for his entertainment. He had explained to the madam how he\nplanned to turn the innocent young man into a murderer: by paying for\nregular visits and making him accustomed to a luxury he could not\nafford, then after three months stopping all payment. To maintain his\nhabit, he would be driven to burglary, and perhaps kill someone who\nhappened upon him. Des Esseintes' reflections have only the regret\nthat he did not pursue his scheme closely enough to ensure its\nsuccess. \n\nNear the end of chapter 9, after musing upon the ventriloquist, Des\nEsseintes recalls walking along the Avenue de Latour-Maubourg when he\nwas approached by a young man. He remembers this leading to an intense\nrelationship that he looks back upon with a disturbing ambivalence. \n\nHuysmans expressed antipathy to the moral content of these passages in\na postface of 1903. ]\n\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK AGAINST THE GRAIN ***\n\n***** This file should be named 12341.txt or 12341.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/1\/2\/3\/4\/12341\/\n\nProduced by Harrison Ainsworth\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\n\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\ndownload by the etext year.\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/etext06\n\n    (Or \/etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\n\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/1\/0\/2\/3\/10234\n\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/2\/4\/6\/8\/24689\n\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/GUTINDEX.ALL\n\n","id":362,"split":"train"}
