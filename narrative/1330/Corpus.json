Unlike the ruthless Bussy, Clermont is a Christian Stoic. Clermont is a follower of the Duc de Guise, a powerful nobleman\u00e2\u0080\u0094though this relationship breeds suspicion in the King, who is urged on by the political manipulator Baligny. (Malicious characters in the play see Clermont's devotion to the Guise in homoerotic terms; but the stoical Clermont prefers relations with men over those with women, precisely because they are asexual.) Eventually the Guise is assassinated, and Clermont commits suicide. A subplot involves the relationship between Clermont and Tamyra, Bussy's former lover; Tamyra urges Clermont to take vengeance on her husband Montsurry, the agent of Bussy's destruction. The cowardly Montsurry manages to avoid a confrontation with Clermont through most of the play; but in the final Act, Bussy's ghost rises to tell Clermont that divine justice demands the punishment of Montsurry. Clermont finally persuades Montsurry to face him on the field of honor and accept his death.\nThe Stoic nature of the play extends beyond the values and worldview of the character Clermont. In The Revenge of Bussy D'Ambois, even more so than in other Chapman plays, events are reported rather than enacted, and little actually happens on stage. This has prevented the play from earning itself a significant stage history.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Bussy D'Ambois and The Revenge of Bussy\nD'Ambois, by George Chapman\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

HEATH & CO.\n\n\n\n\nPrefatory Note\n\n\nIn this volume an attempt is made for the first time to edit _Bussy\nD'Ambois_ and _The Revenge of Bussy D'Ambois_ in a manner suitable to\nthe requirements of modern scholarship. Of the relations of this edition\nto its predecessors some details are given in the Notes on the Text of\nthe two plays. But in these few prefatory words I should like to call\nattention to one or two points, and make some acknowledgments.\n\nThe immediate source of _Bussy D'Ambois_ still remains undiscovered. But\nthe episodes in the career of Chapman's hero, vouched for by\ncontemporaries like Brant\u00c3\u00b4me and Marguerite of Valois, and related in\nsome detail in my _Introduction_, are typical of the material which the\ndramatist worked upon. And an important clue to the spirit in which he\nhandled it is the identification, here first made, of part of Bussy's\ndying speech with lines put by Seneca into the mouth of Hercules in his\nlast agony on Mount Oeta. The exploits of D'Ambois were in Chapman's\nimaginative vision those of a semi-mythical hero rather than of a\nFrenchman whose life overlapped with his own.\n\nOn the _provenance_ of _The Revenge of Bussy D'Ambois_ I have been\nfortunately able, with valuable assistance from others, to cast much new\nlight. In an article in _The Athen\u00c3\u00a6um_, Jan. 10, 1903, I showed that the\nimmediate source of many of the episodes in the play was Edward\nGrimeston's translation (1607) of Jean de Serres's _Inventaire G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9ral\nde l'Histoire de France_. Since that date I owe to Mr. H. Richards,\nFellow of Wadham College, Oxford, the important discovery that a number\nof speeches in the play are borrowed from the _Discourses_ of Epictetus,\nfrom whom Chapman drew his conception of the character of Clermont\nD'Ambois. My brother-in-law, Mr. S. G. Owen, Student of Christ Church,\nhas given me valuable help in explaining some obscure classical\nallusions. Dr. J. A. H. Murray, the editor of the _New English\nDictionary_, has kindly furnished me with the interpretation of a\ndifficult passage in _Bussy D'Ambois_; and Mr. W. J. Craig, editor of\nthe _Arden_ Shakespeare, and Mr. Le Gay Brereton, of the University of\nSidney, have been good enough to proffer helpful suggestions. Finally I\nam indebted to Professor George P. Baker, the General Editor of this\nSeries, for valuable advice and help on a large number of points, while\nthe proofs of this volume were passing through the press.\n\n                                                           F. S. B.\n\n\n\n\nBiography\n\n\nGeorge Chapman was probably born in the year after Elizabeth's\naccession. Anthony Wood gives 1557 as the date, but the inscription on\nhis portrait, prefixed to the edition of _The Whole Works of Homer_ in\n1616, points to 1559. He was a native of Hitchin in Hertfordshire, as we\nlearn from an allusion in his poem _Euthymi\u00c3\u00a6 Raptus_ or _The Teares of\nPeace_, and from W. Browne's reference to him in _Britannia's Pastorals_\nas \"the learned shepheard of faire Hitching Hill.\" According to Wood \"in\n1574 or thereabouts, he being well grounded in school learning was sent\nto the University.\" Wood is uncertain whether he went first to Oxford or\nto Cambridge, but he is sure, though he gives no authority for the\nstatement, that Chapman spent some time at the former \"where he was\nobserved to be most excellent in the Latin & Greek tongues, but not in\nlogic or philosophy, and therefore I presume that that was the reason\nwhy he took no degree there.\"\n\nHis life for almost a couple of decades afterwards is a blank, though it\nhas been conjectured on evidences drawn from _The Shadow of Night_ and\n_Alphonsus Emperor of Germany_, respectively, that he served in one of\nSir F. Vere's campaigns in the Netherlands, and that he travelled in\nGermany. _The Shadow of Night_, consisting of two \"poeticall hymnes\"\nappeared in 1594, and is his first extant work. It was followed in 1595\nby _Ovid's Banquet of Sence_, _The Amorous Zodiac_, and other poems.\nThese early compositions, while containing fine passages, are obscure\nand crabbed in style.[v-1] In 1598 appeared Marlowe's fragmentary _Hero\nand Leander_ with Chapman's continuation. By this year he had\nestablished his position as a playwright, for Meres in his _Palladis\nTamia_ praises him both as a writer of tragedy and of comedy. We know\nfrom Henslowe's _Diary_ that his earliest extant comedy _The Blinde\nBegger of Alexandria_ was produced on February 12, 1596, and that for\nthe next two or three years he was working busily for this enterprising\nmanager. _An Humerous dayes Myrth_ (pr. 1599), and _All Fooles_ (pr.\n1605) under the earlier title of _The World Runs on Wheels_,[vi-1] were\ncomposed during this period.\n\nMeanwhile he had begun the work with which his name is most closely\nlinked, his translation of Homer. The first instalment, entitled _Seaven\nBookes of the Iliades of Homere, Prince of Poets_, was published in\n1598, and was dedicated to the Earl of Essex. After the Earl's execution\nChapman found a yet more powerful patron, for, as we learn from the\nletters printed recently in _The Athen\u00c3\u00a6um_ (cf. _Bibliography_, sec.\nIII), he was appointed about 1604 \"sewer (i. e. cupbearer) in ordinary,\"\nto Prince Henry, eldest son of James I. The Prince encouraged him to\nproceed with his translation, and about 1609 appeared the first twelve\nbooks of the _Iliad_ (including the seven formerly published) with a\nfine \"Epistle Dedicatory,\" to \"the high-born Prince of men, Henry.\" In\n1611 the version of the _Iliad_ was completed, and that of the _Odyssey_\nwas, at Prince Henry's desire, now taken in hand. But the untimely death\nof the Prince, on November 6th, 1612, dashed all Chapman's hopes of\nreceiving the anticipated reward of his labours. According to a petition\nwhich he addressed to the Privy Council, the Prince had promised him on\nthe conclusion of his translation \u00c2\u00a3300, and \"uppon his deathbed a good\npension during my life.\" Not only were both of these withheld, but he\nwas deprived of his post of \"sewer\" by Prince Charles. Nevertheless he\ncompleted the version of the _Odyssey_ in 1614, and in 1616 he published\na folio volume entitled _The Whole Works of Homer_. The translation, in\nspite of its inaccuracies and its \"conceits,\" is, by virtue of its\nsustained dignity and vigour, one of the noblest monuments of\nElizabethan genius.\n\nBy 1605, if not earlier, Chapman had resumed his work for the stage. In\nthat year he wrote conjointly with Marston and Jonson the comedy of\n_Eastward Hoe_. On account of some passages reflecting on the Scotch,\nthe authors were imprisoned. The details of the affair are obscure.\nAccording to Jonson, in his conversation later with Drummond, Chapman\nand Marston were responsible for the obnoxious passages, and he\nvoluntarily imprisoned himself with them. But in one of the recently\nprinted letters, which apparently refers to this episode, Chapman\ndeclares that he and Jonson lie under the Kings displeasure for \"two\nclawses and both of them not our owne,\" i. e., apparently, written by\nMarston.[vii-1] However this may be, the offenders were soon released,\nand Chapman continued energetically his dramatic work. In 1606 appeared\ntwo of his most elaborate comedies, _The Gentleman Usher_ and _Monsieur\nD'Olive_, and in the next year was published his first and most\nsuccessful tragedy, _Bussy D'Ambois_. In 1608 were produced two\nconnected plays, _The Conspiracie and Tragedie of Charles, Duke of\nByron_, dealing with recent events in France, and based upon materials\nin E. Grimeston's translation (1607) of Jean de Serres' History. Again\nChapman found himself in trouble with the authorities, for the French\nambassador, offended by a scene in which Henry IV's Queen was introduced\nin unseemly fashion, had the performance of the plays stopped for a\ntime. Chapman had to go into hiding to avoid arrest, and when he came\nout, he had great difficulty in getting the plays licensed for\npublication, even with the omission of the offending episodes. His\nfourth tragedy based on French history, _The Revenge of Bussy D'Ambois_,\nappeared in 1613. It had been preceded by two comedies, _May-Day_\n(1611), and _The Widdowes' Teares_ (1612). Possibly, as Mr Dobell\nsuggests (_Athen\u00c3\u00a6um_, 23 March, 1901), the coarse satire of the latter\nplay may have been due to its author's annoyance at the apparent refusal\nof his suit by a widow to whom some of the recently printed letters are\naddressed. In 1613 he produced his _Maske of the Middle Temple and\nLyncolns Inne_, which was one of the series performed in honour of the\nmarriage of the Princess Elizabeth and the Elector Palatine. Another\nhymeneal work, produced on a much less auspicious occasion, was an\nallegorical poem, _Andromeda Liberata_, celebrating the marriage of the\nEarl of Somerset with the divorced Lady Essex in December, 1613.\n\nThe year 1614, when the _Odyssey_ was completed, marks the culminating\npoint of Chapman's literary activity. Henceforward, partly perhaps owing\nto the disappointment of his hopes through Prince Henry's death, his\nproduction was more intermittent. Translations of the _Homeric Hymns_,\nof the _Georgicks_ of Hesiod, and other classical writings, mainly\noccupy the period till 1631. In that year he printed another tragedy,\n_C\u00c3\u00a6sar and Pompey_, which, however, as we learn from the dedication, had\nbeen written \"long since.\" The remaining plays with which his name has\nbeen connected did not appear during his lifetime. A comedy, _The Ball_,\nlicensed in 1632, but not published till 1639, has the names of Chapman\nand Shirley on the title-page, but the latter was certainly its main\nauthor. Another play, however, issued in the same year, and ascribed to\nthe same hands, _The Tragedie of Chabot, Admiral of France_ makes the\nimpression, from its subject-matter and its style, of being chiefly due\nto Chapman. In 1654 two tragedies, _Alphonsus Emperour of Germany_ and\n_The Revenge for Honour_, were separately published under Chapman's\nname. Their authorship, however, is doubtful. There is nothing in the\nstyle or diction of _Alphonsus_ which resembles Chapman's undisputed\nwork, and it is hard to believe that he had a hand in it. _The Revenge\nfor Honour_ is on an Oriental theme, entirely different from those\nhandled by Chapman in his other tragedies, and the versification is\nmarked by a greater frequency of feminine endings than is usual with\nhim; but phrases and thoughts occur which may be paralleled from his\nplays, and the work may be from his hand.\n\nOn May 12, 1634, he died, and was buried in the churchyard of St.\nGiles's in the Field, where his friend Inigo Jones erected a monument to\nhis memory. According to Wood, he was a person of \"most reverend aspect,\nreligious and temperate, qualities rarely meeting in a poet.\" Though his\nmaterial success seems to have been small, he gained the friendship of\nmany of the most illustrious spirits of his time--Essex, Prince Henry,\nBacon, Jonson, Webster, among the number--and it has been his good\nfortune to draw in after years splendid tributes from such successors in\nthe poetic art as Keats and A. C. Swinburne.\n\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[v-1] This Biography was written before the appearance of Mr. Acheson's\nvolume, _Shakespeare and the Rival Poet_. Without endorsing all his\narguments or conclusions, I hold that Mr. Acheson has proved that\nShakespeare in a number of his Sonnets refers to these earlier poems of\nChapman's. He has thus brought almost conclusive evidence in support of\nMinto's identification of Shakespeare's rival with Chapman--a conjecture\nwith which I, in 1896, expressed strong sympathy in my _Shakspere and\nhis Predecessors_.\n\n[vi-1] This identification seems established by the entry in Henslowe's\n_Diary_, under date 2 July 1599. \"Lent unto thomas Dowton to paye Mr\nChapman, in full paymente for his boocke called the world rones a\nwhelles, and now all foolles, but the foolle, some of ______ xxxs.\"\n\n[vii-1] See pp. 158-64, Jonson's _Eastward Hoe and Alchemist_, F. E.\nSchelling (Belles Lettres Series, 1904).\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nThe group of Chapman's plays based upon recent French history, to which\n_Bussy D'Ambois_ and its sequel belong, forms one of the most unique\nmemorials of the Elizabethan drama. The playwrights of the period were\nprofoundly interested in the annals of their own country, and exploited\nthem for the stage with a magnificent indifference to historical\naccuracy. Gorboduc and Locrine were as real to them as any Lancastrian\nor Tudor prince, and their reigns were made to furnish salutary lessons\nto sixteenth century \"magistrates.\" Scarcely less interesting were the\nheroes of republican Greece and Rome: C\u00c3\u00a6sar, Pompey, and Antony, decked\nout in Elizabethan garb, were as familiar to the playgoers of the time\nas their own national heroes, real or legendary. But the contemporary\nhistory of continental states had comparatively little attraction for\nthe dramatists of the period, and when they handled it, they usually had\nsome political or religious end in view. Under a thin veil of allegory,\nLyly in _Midas_ gratified his audience with a scathing denunciation of\nthe ambition and gold-hunger of Philip II of Spain; and half a century\nlater Middleton in a still bolder and more transparent allegory, _The\nGame of Chess_, dared to ridicule on the stage Philip's successor, and\nhis envoy, Gondomar. But both plays were suggested by the elements of\nfriction in the relations of England and Spain.\n\nFrench history also supplied material to some of the London\nplaywrights, but almost exclusively as it bore upon the great conflict\nbetween the forces of Roman Catholicism and Protestantism. The _Masaker\nof France_, which Henslowe mentions as having been played on January 3,\n1592-3, may or may not be identical with Marlowe's _The Massacre at\nParis_, printed towards the close of the sixteenth century, but in all\nprobability it expressed similarly the burning indignation of Protestant\nEngland at the appalling events of the Eve of St. Bartholomew. Whatever\nMarlowe's religious or irreligious views may have been, he acted on this\noccasion as the mouthpiece of the vast majority of his countrymen, and\nhe founded on recent French history a play which, with all its defects,\nis of special interest to our present inquiry. For Chapman, who finished\nMarlowe's incompleted poem, _Hero and Leander_, must have been familiar\nwith this drama, which introduced personages and events that were partly\nto reappear in the two _Bussy_ plays. A brief examination of _The\nMassacre at Paris_ will, therefore, help to throw into relief the\nspecial characteristics of Chapman's dramas.\n\nIt opens with the marriage, in 1572, of Henry of Navarre and Margaret,\nsister of King Charles IX, which was intended to assuage the religious\nstrife. But the Duke of Guise, the protagonist of the play, is\ndetermined to counterwork this policy, and with the aid of Catherine de\nMedicis, the Queen-Mother, and the Duke of Anjou (afterwards Henry III),\nhe arranges the massacre of the Huguenots. Of the events of the fatal\nnight we get a number of glimpses, including the murder of a\nProtestant, Scroune, by Mountsorrell (Chapman's Montsurry), who is\nrepresented as one of the Guise's most fanatical adherents. Charles soon\nafterwards dies, and is succeeded by his brother Henry, but \"his mind\nruns on his minions,\" and Catherine and the Guise wield all real power.\nBut there is one sphere which Guise cannot control--his wife's heart,\nwhich is given to Mugeroun, one of the \"minions\" of the King. Another of\nthe minions, Joyeux, is sent against Henry of Navarre, and is defeated\nand slain; but Henry, learning that Guise has raised an army against his\nsovereign \"to plant the Pope and Popelings in the realm,\" joins forces\nwith the King against the rebel, who is treacherously murdered and dies\ncrying, \"_Vive la messe!_ perish Huguenots!\" His brother, the Cardinal,\nmeets a similar fate, but the house of Lorraine is speedily revenged by\na friar, who stabs King Henry. He dies, vowing vengeance upon Rome, and\nsending messages to Queen Elizabeth, \"whom God hath bless'd for hating\npapistry.\"\n\nIt is easy to see how a play on these lines would have appealed to an\nElizabethan audience, while Marlowe, whether his religious sympathies\nwere engaged or not, realized the dramatic possibilities of the figure\nof the Guise, one of the lawlessly aspiring brotherhood that had so\nirresistible a fascination for his genius. But it is much more difficult\nto understand why, soon after the accession of James I, Chapman should\nhave gone back to the same period of French history, and reintroduced a\nnumber of the same prominent figures, Henry III, Guise, his Duchess, and\nMountsorrell, not in their relation to great political and religious\noutbreaks, but grouped round a figure who can scarcely have been very\nfamiliar to the English theatre-going public--Louis de Clermont, Bussy\nd'Amboise.[xii-1]\n\nThis personage was born in 1549, and was the eldest son of Jacques de\nClermont d'Amboise, seigneur de Bussy et de Saxe-Fontaine, by his first\nwife, Catherine de Beauvais. He followed the career of arms, and in 1568\nwe hear of him as a commandant of a company. He was in Paris during the\nmassacre of St. Bartholomew, and took advantage of it to settle a\nprivate feud. He had had a prolonged lawsuit with his cousin Antoine de\nClermont, a prominent Huguenot, and follower of the King of Navarre.\nWhile his rival was fleeing for safety he had the misfortune to fall\ninto the hands of Bussy, who dispatched him then and there. He\nafterwards distinguished himself in various operations against the\nHuguenots, and by his bravery and accomplishments won the favour of the\nDuke of Anjou, who, after the accession of Henry III in 1575, was heir\nto the throne. The Duke in this year appointed him his _couronell_, and\nhenceforward he passed into his service. In 1576, as a reward for\nnegotiating \"_la paix de Monsieur_\" with the Huguenots, the Duke\nreceived the territories of Anjou, Touraine, and Berry, and at once\nappointed Bussy governor of Anjou. In November the new governor arrived\nat Angers, the capital of the Duchy, and was welcomed by the citizens;\nbut the disorders and exactions of his troops soon aroused the anger of\nthe populace, and the King had to interfere in their behalf, though for\na time Bussy set his injunctions at defiance. At last he retired from\nthe city, and rejoined the Duke, in close intercourse with whom he\nremained during the following years, accompanying him finally on his\nunsuccessful expedition to the Low Countries in the summer of 1578. On\nAnjou's return to court in January, 1579, Bussy, who seems to have\nalienated his patron by his presumptuous behaviour, did not go with him,\nbut took up his residence again in the territory of Anjou. He was less\noccupied, however, with his official duties than with his criminal\npassion for Fran\u00c3\u00a7oise de Maridort, wife of the Comte de Monsoreau, who\nhad been appointed _grand-veneur_ to the Duke. The favorite mansion of\nthe Comte was at La Coutanci\u00c3\u00a8re, and it was here that Bussy ardently\npursued his intrigue with the Countess. But a jocular letter on the\nsubject, which he sent to the Duke of Anjou, was shown, according to the\nhistorian, De Thou, by the Duke to the King, who, in his turn, passed it\non to Montsoreau. The latter thereupon forced his wife to make a\ntreacherous assignation with Bussy at the ch\u00c3\u00a2teau on the night of the\n18th of August, and on his appearance, with his companion in pleasure,\nClaude Colasseau, they were both assassinated by the retainers of the\ninfuriated husband.\n\nThe tragic close of Bussy's life has given his career an interest\ndisproportionate to his historical importance. But the drama of La\nCoutanci\u00c3\u00a8re was only the final episode in a career crowded with romantic\nincidents. The annalists and memoir-writers of the period prove that\nBussy's exploits as a duellist and a gallant had impressed vividly the\nimagination of his contemporaries. Margaret of Valois, the wife of Henry\nIV, Brant\u00c3\u00b4me, who was a relative and friend of D'Ambois, and L'Estoile,\nthe chronicler and journalist, are amongst those who have left us their\nimpressions of this _beau sabreur_. Chapman must have had access to\nmemorials akin to theirs as a foundation for his drama, and though, for\nchronological reasons, they cannot have been utilized by him, they\nillustrate the materials which he employed.\n\nThe first two Acts of the play are chiefly occupied with Bussy's\narrival at court, his entry into the service of Monsieur, his quarrel\nwith Guise, and the duel between himself and Barrisor, with two\nsupporters on either side. Brant\u00c3\u00b4me, in his _Discours sur les Duels_,\nrelates from personal knowledge an incident between Guise and Bussy,\nwhich took place shortly after the accession of Henry III. The Duke took\noccasion of a royal hunting party to draw Bussy alone into the forest,\nand to demand certain explanations of him. D'Ambois gave these in a\nsatisfactory manner; but had he not done so, the Duke declared, in spite\nof their difference of rank, he would have engaged in single combat with\nhim. The explanations demanded may well have concerned the honour of the\nDuchess, and we get at any rate a hint for the episode in Chapman's play\n(I, ii, 57-185).\n\nFor the duelling narrative (II, i, 35-137) we get considerably more than\na hint. Our chief authority is again Brant\u00c3\u00b4me, in another work, the\n_Discours sur les Couronnels de l'infanterie de France_. He tells us\nthat he was with Bussy at a play, when a dispute arose between him and\nthe Marquis of Saint-Phal as to whether the jet embroidery on a certain\nmuff represented XX or YY. The quarrel was appeased for the time being,\nbut on the following day Bussy, meeting Saint-Phal at the house of a\nlady with whom he had had relations, and who was now the mistress of the\nMarquis, renewed the dispute. An encounter took place between Bussy,\nsupported by five or six gentlemen, and Saint-Phal, assisted by an equal\nnumber of Scotchmen of the Royal Guard, one of whom wounded Bussy's\nhand. Thereupon Saint-Phal withdrew, but his fire-eating rival was\nanxious at all hazards for another encounter. It was only with the\ngreatest difficulty, as Brant\u00c3\u00b4me relates in entertaining fashion, that\nthe King was able to bring about a reconciliation between them. Such an\nepisode, reported with exaggeration of details, might well have\nsuggested the narrative in Act II of the triple encounter.\n\nBrant\u00c3\u00b4me further relates a midnight attack upon Bussy, about a month\nlater, by a number of his jealous rivals, when he had a narrow escape\nfrom death. Of this incident another account has been given by Margaret\nof Valois in her _M\u00c3\u00a9moires_. Margaret and her brother, the Duke of\nAnjou, were devoted to one another, and Bussy was for a time a paramour\nof the Queen of Navarre. Though she denies the liaison, she says of him\nthat there was not \"_en ce si\u00c3\u00a8cle-l\u00c3\u00a0 de son sexe et de sa qualit\u00c3\u00a9 rien\nde semblable en valeur, reputation, grace, et esprit_.\" Margaret,\nL'Estoile, and Brant\u00c3\u00b4me all relate similar incidents during Bussy's\nsojourn at court in the year 1578, and the last-named adds:\n\n     \"_Si je voulois raconter toutes les querelles qu'il a eues,\n     j'aurois beaucoup affaire; h\u00c3\u00a9las! il en a trop eu, et toutes\n     les a desmesl\u00c3\u00a9es \u00c3\u00a0 son tr\u00c3\u00a8s-grand honneur et heur. Il en\n     vouloit souvant par trop \u00c3\u00a0 plusieurs, sans aucun respect; je\n     luy ay dict cent fois; mais il se fioit tant en sa valeur qu'il\n     mesprisoit tous les conseils de ses amis . . . Dieu ayt son \u00c3\u00a2me!\n     Mais il mourut (quand il trespassa) un preux tr\u00c3\u00a9s vaillant et\n     g\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9reux._\"\n\nIt is plain, therefore, that Chapman in his picture of Bussy's quarrels\nand encounters-at-arms was deviating little, except in details of names\nand dates, from the actual facts of history. Bussy's career was so\nromantic that it was impossible for even the most inventive dramatist to\nembellish it. This was especially true of its closing episode, which\noccupies the later acts of Chapman's drama--the intrigue with the\nCountess of Montsoreau and the tragic fate which it involved. It is\nsomewhat singular that the earliest narratives of the event which have\ncome down to us were published subsequently to the play. The statement,\naccepted for a long time, that De Thou's _Histori\u00c3\u00a6 sui Temporis_ was the\nbasis of Chapman's tragedy, has been completely disproved. The passage\nin which he narrates the story of Bussy's death does not occur in the\nearlier editions of his work, and first found its way into the issue\npublished at Geneva in 1620. A similar narrative appeared in the\nfollowing year in L'Estoile's _Journal_, which first saw the light in\n1621, ten years after its author's death. But under a thin disguise\nthere had already appeared a detailed history of Bussy's last _amour_\nand his fall, though this, too, was later than Chapman's drama. A\nnovelist, Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois de Rosset, had published a volume of tales entitled\n_Les Histoires Tragiques de Nostre Temps_. The earliest known edition is\none of 1615, though it was preceded, probably not long, by an earlier\nedition full of \"_fautes insupportables_,\" for which Rosset apologizes.\nHe is careful to state in his preface that he is relating \"_des\nhistoires autant veritables que tristes et funestes. Les noms de la\npluspart des personnages sont seulement desguisez en ce Theatre, \u00c3\u00a0 fin\nde n'affliger pas tant les familles de ceux qui en ont donn\u00c3\u00a9 le sujet._\"\nThe fate of Bussy forms the subject of the seventeenth history,\nentitled \"_De la mort pitoyable du valeureux Lysis_.\" Lysis was the name\nunder which Margaret of Valois celebrated the memory of her former lover\nin a poem entitled \"_L'esprit de Lysis disant adieu \u00c3\u00a0 sa Flore_.\" But\napart from this proof of identification, the details given by Rosset are\nso full that there can be no uncertainty in the matter. Indeed, in some\nof his statements, as in his account of the first meeting between the\nlovers, Rosset probably supplies facts unrecorded by the historians of\nthe period.\n\nFrom a comparison of these more or less contemporary records it is\nevident that, whatever actual source Chapman may have used, he has given\nin many respects a faithful portrait of the historical Bussy D'Ambois.\nIt happened that at the time of Bussy's death the Duke of Anjou, his\npatron, was in London, laying ineffective siege to the hand of\nElizabeth. This coincidence may have given wider currency in England to\nBussy's tragic story than would otherwise have been the case. But a\nquarter of a century later this adventitious interest would have\nevaporated, and the success of Chapman's play would be due less to its\ntheme than to its qualities of style and construction. To these we must\ntherefore now turn.\n\nWith Chapman's enthusiasm for classical literature, it was natural that\nhe should be influenced by classical models, even when handling a\nthoroughly modern subject. His Bussy is, in certain aspects, the _miles\ngloriosus_ of Latin drama, while in the tragic crisis of his fate he\ndemonstrably borrows, as is shown in this edition for the first time,\nthe accents of the Senecan Hercules on Mount Oeta (cf. notes on v, iv,\n100 and 109). Hence the technique of the work is largely of the\nsemi-Senecan type with which Kyd and his school had familiarized the\nEnglish stage. Thus Bussy's opening monologue serves in some sort as a\nPrologue; the narrative by the _Nuntius_ in Act II, i, 35-137, is in the\nmost approved classical manner; an _Umbra_ or Ghost makes its regulation\nentrance in the last Act, and though the accumulated horrors of the\nclosing scenes violate every canon of classical art, they had become\ntraditional in the semi-Senecan type of play, and were doubtless highly\nacceptable to the audiences of the period. But while the Senecan and\nsemi-Senecan methods had their dangers, their effect on English\ndramatists was in so far salutary that they necessitated care in\nplot-construction. And it is doubtful whether Chapman has hitherto\nreceived due credit for the ingenuity and skill with which he has woven\ninto the texture of his drama a number of varied threads. Bussy's life\nwas, as has been shown, crowded with incidents, and the final\ncatastrophe at La Coutanci\u00c3\u00a8re had no direct relation with the duels and\nintrigues of his younger days at Court. Chapman, however, has connected\nthe earlier and the later episodes with much ingenuity. Departing from\nhistorical truth, he represents Bussy as a poor adventurer at Court,\nwhose fortunes are entirely made by the patronage of Monsieur. His\nsudden elevation turns his head, and he insults the Duke of Guise by\ncourting his wife before his face, thus earning his enmity, and exciting\nat the same time the ridicule of the other courtiers. Hence springs the\nencounter with Barrisor and his companions, and this is made to serve as\nan introduction to the _amour_ between Bussy and Tamyra, as Chapman\nchooses to call the Countess of Montsurry. For Barrisor, we are told\n(II, ii, 202 ff.), had long wooed the Countess, and the report was\nspread that the \"main quarrel\" between him and Bussy \"grew about her\nlove,\" Barrisor thinking that D'Ambois's courtship of the Duchess of\nGuise was really directed towards \"his elected mistress.\" On the advice\nof a Friar named Comolet, to whom Chapman strangely enough assigns the\nrepulsive _r\u00c3\u00b4le_ of go-between, Bussy wins his way at night into\nTamyra's chamber on the plea that he has come to reassure her that she\nis in no way guilty of Barrisor's blood. Thus the main theme of the play\nis linked with the opening incidents, and the action from first to last\nis laid in Paris, whither the closing scenes of Bussy's career are\nshifted. By another ingenious departure from historical truth the Duke\nof Anjou, to whom Bussy owes his rise, is represented as the main agent\nin his fall. He is angered at the favour shown by the King to the\nfollower whom he had raised to serve his own ends, and he conspires with\nGuise for his overthrow. He is the more eagerly bent upon this when he\ndiscovers through Tamyra's waiting-woman that the Countess, whose\nfavours he has vainly sought to win, has granted them to Bussy. It is he\nwho, by means of a paper, convinces Montsurry of his wife's guilt, and\nit is he, together with Guise, who suggests to the Count the stratagem\nby which Tamyra is forced to decoy her paramour to his doom. All this\nis deftly contrived and does credit to Chapman's dramatic craftsmanship.\nIt is true that the last two Acts are spun out with supernatural\nepisodes of a singularly unconvincing type. The Friar's invocation of\nBehemoth, who proves a most unserviceable spirit, and the vain attempts\nof this scoundrelly ecclesiastic's ghost to shield D'Ambois from his\nfate, strike us as wofully crude and mechanical excursions into the\noccult. But they doubtless served their turn with audiences who had an\ninsatiable craving for such manifestations, and were not particular as\nto the precise form they took.\n\nIn point of character-drawing the play presents a more complex problem.\nBussy is a typically Renaissance hero and appealed to the sympathies of\nan age which set store above all things on exuberant vitality and\nprowess, and was readier than our own to allow them full rein. The King\nseems to be giving voice to Chapman's conception of Bussy's character,\nwhen he describes him in III, ii, 90 ff. as\n\n     \"A man so good that only would uphold\n     Man in his native noblesse, from whose fall\n     All our dissentions arise,\" &c.\n\nAnd in certain aspects Bussy does not come far short of the ideal thus\npictured. His bravery, versatility, frankness, and readiness of speech\nare all vividly portrayed, while his mettlesome temper and his arrogance\nare alike essential to his _r\u00c3\u00b4le_, and are true to the record of the\nhistorical D'Ambois. But there is a coarseness of fibre in Chapman's\ncreation, an occasional foul-mouthed ribaldry of utterance which robs\nhim of sympathetic charm. He has in him more of the swashbuckler and the\nbully than of the courtier and the cavalier. Beaumont and Fletcher, one\ncannot help feeling, would have invested him with more refinement and\ngrace, and would have given a tenderer note to the love-scenes between\nhim and Tamyra. Bussy takes the Countess's affections so completely by\nstorm, and he ignores so entirely the rights of her husband, that it is\ndifficult to accord him the measure of sympathy in his fall, which the\nfate of a tragic hero should evoke.\n\nTamyra appeals more to us, because we see in her more of the conflict\nbetween passion and moral obligation, which is the essence of drama. Her\nscornful rejection of the advances of Monsieur (II, ii), though her\nhusband palliates his conduct as that of \"a bachelor and a courtier, I,\nand a prince,\" proves that she is no light o' love, and that her\nsurrender to Bussy is the result of a sudden and overmastering passion.\nEven in the moment of keenest expectation she is torn between\nconflicting emotions (II, ii, 169-182), and after their first interview,\nBussy takes her to task because her\n\n                 \"Conscience is too nice,\n     And bites too hotly of the Puritane spice.\"\n\nBut she masters her scruples sufficiently to play the thorough-going\ndissembler when she meets her husband, and she keeps up the pretence\nwhen she declares to Bussy before the Court (III, ii, 138), \"Y'are one I\nknow not,\" and speaks of him vaguely in a later scene as \"the man.\" So,\ntoo, when Montsurry first tells her of the suspicions which Monsieur\nhas excited in him, she protests with artfully calculated indignation\nagainst the charge of wrong-doing with this \"serpent.\" But the brutal\nand deliberate violence of her husband when he knows the truth, and the\nperfidious meanness with which he makes her the reluctant instrument of\nher lover's ruin, win back for her much of our alienated sympathy. Yet\nat the close her position is curiously equivocal. It is at her prayer\nthat Bussy has spared Montsurry when \"he hath him down\" in the final\nstruggle; but when her lover is mortally wounded by a pistol shot, she\nimplores his pardon for her share in bringing him to his doom. And when\nthe Friar's ghost seeks to reconcile husband and wife, the former is\njustified in crying ironically (V, iv, 163-64):\n\n     \"See how she merits this, still kneeling by,\n     And mourning his fall, more than her own fault!\"\n\nMontsurry's portraiture, indeed, suffers from the same lack of\nconsistency as his wife's. In his earlier relations with her he strikes\na tenderer note than is heard elsewhere in the play, and his first\noutburst of fury, when his suspicions are aroused, springs, like\nOthello's, from the depth of his love and trust (IV, i, 169-70):\n\n                   \"My whole heart is wounded,\n     When any least thought in you is but touch'd.\"\n\nBut there is nothing of Othello's noble agony of soul, nor of his sense\nthat he is carrying out a solemn judicial act on the woman he still\nloves, in Montsurry's long-drawn torture of his wife. Indeed a\ncomparison of the episodes brings into relief the restraint and purity\nof Shakespeare's art when handling the most terrible of tragic themes.\nYet the Moor himself might have uttered Montsurry's cry (V, i, 183-85),\n\n                 \"Here, here was she\n     That was a whole world without spot to me,\n     Though now a world of spot.\"\n\nAnd there is something of pathetic dignity in his final forgiveness of\nhis wife, coupled with the declaration that his honour demands that she\nmust fly his house for ever.\n\nMonsieur and the Guise are simpler types. The former is the ambitious\nvillain of quality, chafing at the thought that there is but a thread\nbetwixt him and a crown, and prepared to compass his ends by any means\nthat fall short of the actual killing of the King. It is as a useful\nadherent of his faction that he elevates Bussy, and when he finds him\nfavoured by Henry he ruthlessly strikes him down, all the more readily\nthat he is his successful rival for Tamyra's love. He is the typical\nRenaissance politician, whose characteristics are expounded with\ncharacteristically vituperative energy by Bussy in III, ii, 439-94.\n\nBeside this arch-villain, the Guise, aspiring and factious though he be,\nfalls into a secondary place. Probably Chapman did not care to elaborate\na figure of whom Marlowe had given so powerful a sketch in the _Massacre\nat Paris_. The influence of the early play may also be seen in the\nhandling of the King, who is portrayed with an indulgent pen, and who\nreappears in the _r\u00c3\u00b4le_ of an enthusiastic admirer of the English Queen\nand Court. The other personages in the drama are colourless, though\nChapman succeeds in creating the general atmosphere of a frivolous and\ndissolute society.\n\nBut the plot and portraiture in _Bussy D'Ambois_ are both less\ndistinctive than the \"full and heightened\" style, to which was largely\ndue its popularity with readers and theatre-goers of its period, but\nwhich was afterwards to bring upon it such severe censure, when taste\nhad changed. Dryden's onslaught in his _Dedication to the Spanish Friar_\n(1681) marks the full turn of the tide. The passage is familiar, but it\nmust be reproduced here:\n\n     \"I have sometimes wondered, in the reading, what has become of\n     those glaring colours which annoyed me in _Bussy D'Ambois_\n     upon the theatre; but when I had taken up what I supposed a\n     fallen star, I found I had been cozened with a jelly; nothing\n     but a cold dull mass, which glittered no longer than it was\n     shooting; a dwarfish thought, dressed up in gigantic words,\n     repetition in abundance, looseness of expression, and gross\n     hyperboles; the sense of one line expanded prodigiously into\n     ten; and, to sum up all, uncorrect English, and a hideous\n     mingle of false poetry and true nonsense; or, at best, a\n     scantling of wit, which lay gasping for life, and groaning\n     beneath a heap of rubbish. A famous modern poet used to\n     sacrifice every year a Statius to Virgil's _manes_; and I have\n     indignation enough to burn a _D'Ambois_ annually to the memory\n     of Jonson.\"\n\nDryden's critical verdicts are never lightly to be set aside. He is\nsingularly shrewd and unprejudiced in his judgements, and has a\nremarkable faculty of hitting the right nail on the head. But Chapman,\nin whom the barbarian and the pedant were so strongly commingled, was a\ntype that fell outside the wide range of Dryden's appreciation. The\nRestoration writer fails, in the first place, to recognize that _Bussy\nD'Ambois_ is pitched advisedly from first to last in a high key.\nThroughout the drama men and women are playing for great stakes. No one\nis ever at rest. Action and passion are both at fever heat. We move in\nan atmosphere of duels and state intrigues by day, of assignations and\nmurders by night. Even the subordinate personages in the drama, the\nstewards and waiting-women, partake of the restless spirit of their\nsuperiors. They are constantly arguing, quarrelling, gossiping--their\ntongues and wits are always on the move. Thus Chapman aimed throughout\nat energy of expression at all costs. To this he sacrificed beauty of\nphrase and rhythm, even lucidity. He pushed it often to exaggerated\nextremes of coarseness and riotous fancy. He laid on \"glaring colours\"\ntill eye and brain are fatigued. To this opening phrase of Dryden no\nexception can be taken. But can his further charges stand? Is it true to\nsay of _Bussy D'Ambois_ that it is characterised by \"dwarfish thought\ndressed up in gigantic words,\" that it is \"a hideous mingle of false\npoetry and true nonsense\"? The accusation of \"nonsense\" recoils upon its\nmaker. Involved, obscure, inflated as Chapman's phrasing not\ninfrequently is, it is not mere rhodomontade, sound, and fury,\nsignifying nothing. There are some passages (as the Notes testify) where\nthe thread of his meaning seems to disappear amidst his fertile imagery,\nbut even here one feels not that sense is lacking, but that one has\nfailed to find the clue to the zigzag movements of Chapman's brain. Nor\nis it fair to speak of Chapman as dressing up dwarfish thoughts in\nstilted phrases. There is not the slightest tendency in the play to spin\nout words to hide a poverty of ideas; in fact many of the difficulties\nspring from excessive condensation. Where Chapman is really assailable\nis in a singular incontinence of imagery. Every idea that occurs to him\nbrings with it a plethora of illustrations, in the way of simile,\nmetaphor, or other figure of speech; he seems impotent to check the\nexuberant riot of his fancy till it has exhausted its whole store. The\nunderlying thought in many passages, though not deserving Dryden's\ncontemptuous epithet, is sufficiently obvious. Chapman was not dowered\nwith the penetrating imagination that reveals as by a lightning flash\nunsuspected depths of human character or of moral law. But he has the\ngnomic faculty that can convey truths of general experience in\naphoristic form, and he can wind into a debatable moral issue with\nadroit casuistry. Take for instance the discussion (II, i, 149-79) on\nthe legitimacy of private vengeance, or (III, i, 10-30) on the nature\nand effect of sin, or (V, ii) on Nature's \"blindness\" in her workings.\nIn lighter vein, but winged with the shafts of a caustic humour are\nBussy's invectives against courtly practices (I, i, 84-104) and\nhypocrisy in high places (III, ii, 25-59), while the \"flyting\" between\nhim and Monsieur is perhaps the choicest specimen of Elizabethan\n\"Billingsgate\" that has come down to us. It was a versatile pen that\ncould turn from passages like these to the epic narrative of the duel,\nor Tamyra's lyric invocation of the \"peaceful regents of the night\" (II,\nii, 158), or Bussy's stately elegy upon himself, as he dies standing,\npropped on his true sword.\n\nIt can only have been the ingrained prejudice of the Restoration period\nagainst \"metaphysical\" verse that deadened Dryden's ear to the charm of\nsuch passages as these. Another less notable poet and playwright of the\ntime showed more discrimination. This was Thomas D'Urfey, who in 1691\nbrought out a revised version of the play at the Theatre Royal. In a\ndedication to Lord Carlisle which he prefixed to this version, on its\npublication in the same year, he testifies to the great popularity of\nthe play after the reopening of the theatres.\n\n     \"About sixteen years since, when first my good or ill stars\n     ordained me a Knight Errant in this fairy land of poetry, I\n     saw the _Bussy d'Ambois_ of Mr. Chapman acted by Mr. Hart,\n     which in spight of the obsolete phrases and intolerable\n     fustian with which a great part of it was cramm'd, and which I\n     have altered in these new sheets, had some extraordinary\n     beauties, which sensibly charmed me; which being improved by\n     the graceful action of that eternally renowned and best of\n     actors, so attracted not only me, but the town in general,\n     that they were obliged to pass by and excuse the gross errors\n     in the writing, and allow it amongst the rank of the topping\n     tragedies of that time.\"\n\nCharles Hart, who was thus one of the long succession of actors to make\na striking reputation in the title part, died in 1683, and, according to\nD'Urfey, \"for a long time after\" the play \"lay buried in [his] grave.\"\nBut \"not willing to have it quite lost, I presumed to revise it and\nwrite the plot new.\" D'Urfey's main alteration was to represent Bussy\nand Tamyra as having been betrothed before the play opens, and the\nlatter forced against her will into a marriage with the wealthy Count\nMontsurry. This, he maintained, palliated the heroine's surrender to\npassion and made her \"distress in the last Act . . . much more liable to\npity.\" Whether morality is really a gainer by this well-meant variation\nfrom the more primitive code of the original play is open to question,\nbut we welcome the substitution of Teresia the \"governess\" and\nconfidante of Tamyra for Friar Comolet as the envoy between the lovers.\nAnother notable change is the omission of the narrative of the\n_Nuntius_, which is replaced by a short duelling scene upon the stage.\nD'Urfey rejects, too, the supernatural machinery in Act IV, and the\ndetails of the torture of the erring Countess, whom, at the close of the\nplay, he represents not as wandering from her husband's home, but as\nstabbing herself in despair.\n\nIf Chapman's plot needed to be \"writ new\" at all, D'Urfey deserves\ncredit for having done his work with considerable skill and taste,\nthough he hints in his dedication that there were detractors who did not\nview his version as favourably as Lord Carlisle. He had some difficulty,\nhe tells us, in finding an actor to undertake the part, but at last\nprevailed upon Mountfort to do so, though he was diffident of appearing\nin a _r\u00c3\u00b4le_ in which Hart had made so great a reputation. Mrs.\nBracegirdle, as we learn from the list of _Dramatis Person\u00c3\u00a6_ prefixed to\nthe published edition, played Tamyra, and the revival seems to have been\na success. But Mountfort was assassinated in the Strand towards the\nclose of the following year, and apparently the career of _Bussy_ upon\nthe boards ended with his life.\n\nIn the same year as D'Urfey revised the play, Langbaine published his\n_Account of the English Dramatick Poets_, wherein (p. 59) he mentions\nthat Bussy \"has the preference\" among all Chapman's writings and\nvindicates it against Dryden's attack:\n\n     \"I know not how Mr. Dryden came to be so possest with\n     indignation against this play, as to resolve to burn one\n     annually to the memory of Ben Jonson: but I know very well\n     that there are some who allow it a just commendation; and\n     others that since have taken the liberty to promise a solemn\n     annual sacrifice of _The Hind and Panther_ to the memory of\n     Mr. Quarles and John Bunyan.\"\n\nBut neither D'Urfey nor Langbaine could secure for _Bussy D'Ambois_ a\nrenewal of its earlier popularity. During the eighteenth century it fell\ninto complete oblivion, and though (as the Bibliography testifies)\nnineteenth-century critics and commentators have sought to atone for the\nneglect of their predecessors, the faults of the play, obvious at a\nglance, have hitherto impaired the full recognition of its distinctive\nmerits of design and thought. To bring these into clearer relief, and\ntrace the relation of its plot to the recorded episodes of Bussy's\ncareer, has been the aim of the preceding pages. It must always count to\nChapman's credit that he, an Englishman, realized to the full the\nfascination of the brilliant Renaissance figure, who had to wait till\nthe nineteenth century to be rediscovered for literary purposes by the\ngreatest romance-writer among his own countrymen. In Bussy, the man of\naction, there was a Titanic strain that appealed to Chapman's\nintractable and rough-hewn genius. To the dramatist he was the classical\nHercules born anew, accomplishing similar feats, and lured to a similar\ntreacherous doom. Thus the cardinal virtue of the play is a Herculean\nenergy of movement and of speech which borrows something of epic quality\nfrom the Homeric translations on which Chapman was simultaneously\nengaged, and thereby links _Bussy D'Ambois_ to his most triumphant\nliterary achievement.\n\nSix years after the publication of the first Quarto of _Bussy D'Ambois_\nChapman issued a sequel, _The Revenge of Bussy D'Ambois_, which, as we\nlearn from the title-page, had been \"often presented at the private\nPlayhouse in the White-Fryers.\" But in the interval he had written two\nother plays based on recent French history, _Byrons Conspiracie_ and\n_The Tragedie of Charles Duke of Byron_, and in certain aspects _The\nRevenge_ is more closely related to these immediate forerunners than to\nthe piece of which it is the titular successor. The discovery which I\nrecently was fortunate enough to make of a common immediate source of\nthe two Byron plays and of _The Revenge_ accentuates the connection\nbetween them, and at the same time throws fresh light on the problem of\nthe _provenance_ of the second D'Ambois drama.\n\nIn his scholarly monograph _Quellen Studien zu den Dramen George\nChapmans, Massingers, und Fords_ (1897), E. Koeppel showed that the\nthree connected plays were based upon materials taken from Jean de\nSerres's _Inventaire G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9ral de l'Histoire de France_ (1603), Pierre\nMatthieu's _Histoire de France durant Sept Ann\u00c3\u00a9es de Paix du Regne de\nHenri IV_ (1605), and P. V. Cayet's _Chronologie Sept\u00c3\u00a9naire de\nl'Histoire de la Paix entre les Roys de France et d'Espagne_ (1605).\nThe picture suggested by Koeppel's treatise was of Chapman collating a\nnumber of contemporary French historical works, and choosing from each\nof them such portions as suited his dramatic purposes. But this\nconception, as I have shown in the _Athen\u00c3\u00a6um_ for Jan. 10, 1903, p. 51,\nmust now be abandoned. Chapman did not go to the French originals at\nall, but to a more easily accessible source, wherein the task of\nselection and rearrangement had already been in large measure performed.\nIn 1607 the printer, George Eld, published a handsome folio, of which\nthe British Museum possesses a fine copy (c. 66, b. 14), originally the\nproperty of Prince Henry, eldest son of James I. Its title is: \"_A\nGeneral Inventorie of the Historie of France, from the beginning of that\nMonarchie, unto the Treatie of Vervins, in the Yeare 1598. Written by\nJhon de Serres. And continued unto these Times, out of the best Authors\nwhich have written of that Subiect. Translated out of French into\nEnglish by Edward Grimeston, Gentleman._\" This work, the popularity of\nwhich is attested by the publication of a second, enlarged, edition in\n1611, was the direct source of the \"Byron\" plays, and of _The Revenge_.\n\nIn a dedication addressed to the Earls of Suffolk and Salisbury,\nGrimeston states that having retired to \"private and domesticke cares\"\nafter \"some years expence in France, for the publike service of the\nState,\" he has translated \"this generall Historie of France written by\nJohn de Serres.\" In a preface \"to the Reader\" he makes the further\nimportant statement:\n\n     \"The History of John de Serres ends with the Treatie at\n     Vervins betwixt France and Spaine in the yeare 1598. I have\n     been importuned to make the History perfect, and to continue\n     it unto these times, whereunto I have added (for your better\n     satisfaction) what I could extract out of Peter Mathew and\n     other late writers touching this subject. Some perchance will\n     challenge me of indiscretion, that I have not translated Peter\n     Mathew onely, being reputed so eloquent and learned a Writer.\n     To them I answere first, that I found many things written by\n     him that were not fit to be inserted, and some things\n     belonging unto the Historie, related by others, whereof he\n     makes no mention. Secondly his style is so full and his\n     discourse so copious, as the worke would have held no\n     proportion, for that this last addition of seven years must\n     have exceeded halfe Serres Historie. Which considerations have\n     made me to draw forth what I thought most materiall for the\n     subject, and to leave the rest as unnecessarie.\"\n\nFrom this we learn that Grimeston followed Jean de Serres till 1598, and\nthat from then till 1604 (his time-limit in his first edition) his\nprincipal source was P. Matthieu's _Histoire de France_, rigorously\ncondensed, and, at the same time, supplemented from other authorities. A\ncollation of Grimeston's text with that of the \"Byron\" plays and _The\nRevenge_ proves that every passage in which the dramatist draws upon\nhistorical materials is to be found within the four corners of the folio\nof 1607. The most striking illustrations of this are to be found in the\n\"Byron\" plays, and I have shown elsewhere (_Athen\u00c3\u00a6um_, _loc. cit._) that\nthough Chapman in handling the career of the ill-fated Marshal of France\nis apparently exploiting Pierre Matthieu, Jean de Serres, and Cayet in\nturn, he is really taking advantage of the labours of Grimeston, who had\nrifled their stores for his skilful historical mosaic. Grimeston must\nthus henceforward be recognized as holding something of the same\nrelation to Chapman as Sir T. North does to Shakespeare, with the\ndistinction that he not only provides the raw material of historical\ntragedy, but goes some way in the refining process.\n\n_The Revenge of Bussy D'Ambois_ follows historical lines less closely\nthan the \"Byron\" plays, but here, too, Grimeston's volume was Chapman's\ninspiring source, and the perusal of its closing pages gives a clue to\nthe origin of this most singular of the dramatist's serious plays. The\nfinal episode included in the folio of 1607 was the plot by which the\nCount d'Auvergne, who had been one of Byron's fellow conspirators, and\nwho had fallen under suspicion for a second time in 1604, was\ntreacherously arrested by agents of the King while attending a review of\ntroops. The position of this narrative (translated from P. Matthieu) at\nthe close of the folio must have helped to draw Chapman's special\nattention to it, and having expended his genius so liberally on the\ncareer of the arch-conspirator of the period, he was apparently moved to\nhandle also that of his interesting confederate. But D'Auvergne's\nfortunes scarcely furnished the stuff for a complete drama, on Chapman's\ncustomary broad scale, and he seems therefore to have conceived the\ningenious idea of utilising them as the groundwork of a sequel to his\nmost popular play, _Bussy D'Ambois_.\n\nHe transformed the Count into an imaginary brother of his former hero.\nFor though D'Ambois had two younger brothers, Hubert, seigneur de\nMoigneville, and Georges, baron de Bussy, it is highly improbable that\nChapman had ever heard of them, and there was nothing in the career of\neither to suggest the figure of Clermont D'Ambois. The name given by\nChapman to this unhistorical addition to the family was, I believe, due\nto a mere chance, if not a misunderstanding. In Grimeston's narrative of\nthe plot against D'Auvergne he mentions that one of the King's agents,\nD'Eurre, \"came to Clermont on Monday at night, and goes unto him\n[D'Auvergne] where he supped.\" Here the name Clermont denotes, of\ncourse, a place. But Chapman may have possibly misconceived it to refer\nto the Count, and, in any case, its occurrence in this context probably\nsuggested its bestowal upon the hero of the second D'Ambois play.\n\nA later passage in Grimeston's history gives an interesting glimpse of\nD'Auvergne's character. We are told that after he had been arrested, and\nwas being conducted to Paris, \"all the way he seemed no more afflicted,\nthen when he was at libertie. He tould youthfull and idle tales of his\nlove, and the deceiving of ladies. Hee shott in a harquebuse at birds,\nwherein hee was so perfect and excellent, as hee did kill larkes as they\nwere flying.\"\n\nFrom this hint of a personality serenely proof against the shocks of\nadversity Chapman elaborated the figure of the \"Senecall man,\" Clermont\nD'Ambois. In developing his conception he drew, however, not primarily,\nas this phrase suggests, from the writings of the Roman senator and\nsage, but from those of the lowlier, though not less authoritative\nexponent of Stoic doctrine, the enfranchised slave, Epictetus. As is\nshown, for the first time, in the Notes to this edition, the\n_Discourses_ of \"the grave Greek moralist,\" known probably through a\nLatin version (cf. II, i, 157), must have been almost as close to\nChapman's hand while he was writing _The Revenge_ as Grimeston's\ncompilation. Five long passages in the play (I, i, 336-42, II, i,\n157-60, II, i, 211-32, III, iv, 58-75, and III, iv, 127-41) are\ntranslated or adapted from specific _dicta_ in the _Discourses_, while\nEpictetus's work in its whole ethical teaching furnished material for\nthe delineation of the ideal Stoic (IV, iv, 14-46) who\n\n         \"May with heavens immortall powers compare,\n     To whom the day and fortune equall are;\n     Come faire or foule, what ever chance can fall,\n     Fixt in himselfe, hee still is one to all.\"\n\nBut in the character of Clermont there mingle other elements than those\nderived from either the historical figure of D'Auvergne, or the ideal\nman of Stoic speculation. Had Hamlet never faltered in the task of\nexecuting justice upon the murderer of his father, it is doubtful if a\nbrother of Bussy would ever have trod the Jacobean stage. Not indeed\nthat the idea of vengeance being sought for D'Ambois's fate by one of\nhis nearest kith and kin was without basis in fact. But it was a sister,\nnot a brother, who had devoted her own and her husband's energies to the\ntask, though finally the matter had been compromised. De Thou, at the\nclose of his account of Bussy's murder, relates (vol. III, lib. LXVII,\np. 330):\n\n     \"_Inde odia capitalia inter Bussianos et Monsorellum exorta:\n     quorum exercendorum onus in se suscepit Joannes Monlucius\n     Balagnius, . . . ducta in matrimonium occisi Bussii sorore,\n     magni animi foemina quae faces irae maritali subjiciebat:\n     vixque post novennium certis conditionibus jussu regis inter\n     eum et Monsorellum transactum fuit._\"[xxxvii-1]\n\nIn a later passage (vol. V, lib. CXVIII, p. 558) he is even more\nexplicit. After referring to Bussy's treacherous assassination, he\ncontinues:\n\n     \"_Quam injuriam Renata ejus soror, generosa foemina et supra\n     sexum ambitiosa, a fratre proximisque neglectam, cum inultam\n     manere impatientissime ferret, Balagnio se ultorem profitente,\n     spretis suorum monitis in matrimonium cum ipso\n     consensit._\"[xxxvii-2]\n\nAs these passages first appeared in De Thou's History in the edition of\n1620, they cannot have been known to Chapman, when he was writing _The\nRevenge_. But the circumstances must have been familiar to him from some\nother source, probably that which supplied the material for the earlier\nplay. He accordingly introduces Ren\u00c3\u00a9e D'Ambois (whom he rechristens\nCharlotte) with her husband into his drama, but with great skill he\nmakes her fiery passion for revenge at all costs a foil to the\nscrupulous and deliberate procedure of the high-souled Clermont. Like\nHamlet, the latter has been commissioned by the ghost of his murdered\nkinsman to the execution of a task alien to his nature.\n\nThough he sends a challenge to Montsurry, and is not lacking in \"the\nD'Ambois spirit,\" the atmosphere in which he lingers with whole-hearted\nzest is that of the philosophical schools. He is eager to draw every\nchance comer into debate on the first principles of action. Absorbed in\nspeculation, he is indifferent to external circumstances. As Hamlet at\nthe crisis of his fate lets himself be shipped off to England, so\nClermont makes no demur when the King, who suspects him of complicity\nwith Guise's traitorous designs, sends him to Cambray, of which his\nbrother-in-law, Baligny, has been appointed Lieutenant. When on his\narrival, his sister, the Lieutenant's wife, upbraids him with\n\"lingering\" their \"dear brother's wreak,\" he makes the confession (III,\nii, 112-15):\n\n                         \"I repent that ever\n     (By any instigation in th'appearance\n     My brothers spirit made, as I imagin'd)\n     That e'er I yeelded to revenge his murther.\"\n\nLike Hamlet, too, Clermont, \"generous and free from all contriving,\" is\nslow to suspect evil in others, and though warned by an anonymous\nletter--here Chapman draws the incidents from the story of Count\nD'Auvergne--he lets himself be entrapped at a \"muster\" or review of\ntroops by the King's emissaries. But the intervention of Guise soon\nprocures his release. In the dialogue that follows between him and his\npatron the influence of Shakespeare's tragedy is unmistakably patent.\nThe latter is confiding to Clermont his apprehensions for the future,\nwhen the ghost of Bussy appears, and chides his brother for his delay in\nrighting his wrongs. That the _Umbra_ of the elder D'Ambois is here\nmerely emulating the attitude of the elder Hamlet's spirit would be\nsufficiently obvious, even if it were not put beyond doubt by the\nexcited dialogue between Guise, to whom the Ghost is invisible, and\nClermont, which is almost a verbal echo of the parallel dialogue between\nthe Danish Prince and the Queen. This second visitation from the unseen\nworld at last stirs up Clermont to execute the long-delayed vengeance\nupon Montsurry, though he is all but forestalled by Charlotte, who has\ndonned masculine disguise for the purpose. But hard upon the deed comes\nthe news of Guise's assassination, and impatient of the earthly barriers\nthat now sever him from his \"lord,\" Clermont takes his own life in the\napproved Stoic fashion. So passes from the scene one of the most\noriginal and engaging figures in our dramatic literature, and the more\nthorough our analysis of the curiously diverse elements out of which he\nhas been fashioned, the higher will be our estimate of Chapman's\ncreative power.\n\nWas it primarily with the motive of providing Clermont with a plausible\nexcuse for suicide that Chapman so startlingly transformed the\npersonality of Henry of Guise? The Duke as he appears in _The Revenge_\nhas scarcely a feature in common either with the Guise of history or of\nthe earlier play. Instead of the turbulent and intriguing noble we see a\n\"true tenth worthy,\" who realizes that without accompanying virtues\n\"greatness is a shade, a bubble,\" and who drinks in from the lips of\nClermont doctrines \"of stability and freedom.\" To such an extent does\nChapman turn apologist for Guise that in a well-known passage (II, i,\n205 ff.) he goes out of his way to declare that the Massacre of St.\nBartholomew was \"hainous\" only \"to a brutish sense, But not a manly\nreason,\" and to argue that the blame lay not with \"religious Guise,\" but\nwith those who had played false to \"faith and true religion.\" So\nastonishing is the dramatist's change of front that, but for the\ncomplete lack of substantiating evidence, one would infer that, like\nDryden in the interval between _Religio Laici_ and _The Hind and\nPanther_, he had joined the Church of Rome. In any case the change is\nnot due to the influence of Grimeston's volume, whence Chapman draws his\nmaterial for the account of Guise's last days. For Jean de Serres (whom\nthe Englishman is here translating) sums up the Duke's character in an\n\"appreciation,\" where virtues and faults are impartially balanced and\nthe latter are in no wise extenuated. It is another tribute to Chapman's\nskill, which only close study of the play in relation to its source\nbrings out, that while he borrows, even to the most minute particulars,\nfrom the annalist, he throws round the closing episodes of Guise's\ncareer a halo of political martyrdom which there is nothing in the\noriginal to suggest. This metamorphosis of Guise is all the more\nremarkable, because Monsieur, his former co-partner in villany,\nreappears, in the one scene where he figures, in the same ribald,\nblustering vein as before, and his death is reported, at the close of\nAct IV, as a fulfilment of Bussy's dying curse.\n\nWhile Guise is transfigured, and Monsieur remains his truculent,\nvainglorious self, Montsurry has suffered a strange degeneration. It is\nsufficiently remarkable, to begin with, after his declaration at the\nend of _Bussy D'Ambois_,\n\n     \"May both points of heavens strait axeltree\n     Conjoyne in one, before thy selfe and me!\"\n\nto find him ready to receive back Tamyra as his wife, though her sole\nmotive in rejoining him is to precipitate vengeance on his head. Nor had\nanything in the earlier play prepared us for the spectacle of him as a\npoltroon, who has \"barricado'd\" himself in his house to avoid a\nchallenge, and who shrieks \"murther!\" at the entrance of an unexpected\nvisitor. In the light of such conduct it is difficult to regard as\nmerely assumed his pusillanimity in the final scene, where he at first\ngrovels before Clermont on the plea that by his baseness he will \"shame\"\nthe avenger's victory. And when he does finally nerve himself to the\nencounter, and dies with words of forgiveness for Clermont and Tamyra on\nhis lips, the episode of reconciliation, though evidently intended to be\nedifying, is so huddled and inconsecutive as to be well-nigh ridiculous.\n\nEqually ineffective and incongruous are the moralising discourses of\nwhich Bussy's ghost is made the spokesman. It does not seem to have\noccurred to Chapman that vindications of divine justice, suitable on the\nlips of the elder Hamlet, fell with singular infelicity from one who had\nmet his doom in the course of a midnight intrigue. In fact, wherever the\ndramatist reintroduces the main figures of the earlier play, he falls to\nan inferior level. He seems unable to revivify its nobler elements, and\nmerely repeats the more melodramatic and garish effects which refuse to\nblend with the classic grace and pathos of Clermont's story. The\naudiences before whom _The Revenge_ was produced evidently showed\nthemselves ill-affected towards such a medley of purely fictitious\ncreations, and of historical personages and incidents, treated in the\nmost arbitrary fashion. For Chapman in his dedicatory letter to Sir\nThomas Howard refers bitterly to the \"maligners\" with whom the play met\n\"in the scenicall presentation,\" and asks who will expect \"the\nautenticall truth of eyther person or action . . . in a poeme, whose\nsubject is not truth, but things like truth?\" He forgets that \"things\nlike truth\" are not attained, when alien elements are forced into\nmechanical union, or when well-known historical characters and events\nare presented under radically false colours. But we who read the drama\nafter an interval of three centuries can afford to be less perturbed\nthan Jacobean playgoers at its audacious juggling with facts, provided\nthat it appeals to us in other ways. We are not likely indeed to adopt\nChapman's view that the elements that give it enduring value are\n\"materiall instruction, elegant and sententious excitation to vertue,\nand deflection from her contrary.\" For these we shall assuredly look\nelsewhere; it is not to them that _The Revenge of Bussy D'Ambois_ owes\nits distinctive charm. The secret of that charm lies outside the spheres\nof \"autenticall truth,\" moral as well as historical. It consists, as it\nseems to me, essentially in this--that the play is one of the most truly\nspontaneous products of English \"humanism\" in its later phase. The same\npassionate impulse--in itself so curiously \"romantic\"--to revitalise\nclassical life and ideals, which prompted Chapman's translation of\n\"Homer, Prince of Poets,\" is the shaping spirit of this singular\ntragedy. Its hero, as we have seen, has strayed into the France of the\nCatholic Reaction from some academe in Athens or in imperial Rome. He\nis, in truth, far more really a spirit risen from the dead than the\nmaterialised _Umbra_ of his brother. His pervasive influence works in\nall around him, so that nobles and courtiers forget for a time the\nstrife of faction while they linger over some fragrant memory of the\nolder world. Epictetus with his doctrines of how to live and how to die;\nthe \"grave Greeke tragedian\" who drew \"the princesse, sweet Antigone\";\nHomer with his \"unmatched poem\"; the orators Demetrius Phalerius and\nDemades--these and their like cast a spell over the scene, and transport\nus out of the troubled atmosphere of sixteenth-century vendetta into the\n\"ampler \u00c3\u00a6ther,\" the \"diviner air,\" of \"the glory that was Greece, the\ngrandeur that was Rome.\"\n\nThus the two _Bussy_ plays, when critically examined, are seen to be\nessentially unlike in spite of their external similarity. The plot of\nthe one springs from that of the other; both are laid in the same period\nand _milieu_; in technique they are closely akin. The diction and\nimagery are, indeed, simpler, and the verse is of more liquid cadence in\n_The Revenge_ than in _Bussy D'Ambois_. But the true difference lies\ndeeper,--in the innermost spirit of the two dramas. _Bussy D'Ambois_ is\nbegotten of \"the very torrent, tempest, and whirlwind\" of passion; it\nthrobs with the stress of an over-tumultuous life. _The Revenge_ is the\noffspring of the meditative impulse, that averts its gaze from the\noutward pageant of existence, to peer into the secrets of Man's ultimate\ndestiny, and his relation to the \"Universal,\" of which he involuntarily\nfinds himself a part.\n\n                                                 FREDERICK S. BOAS.\n\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[xii-1] Through the kindness of Professor Baker I have seen an\nunpublished paper of Mr. P. C. Hoyt, Instructor in Harvard University,\nwhich first calls attention to the combined suggestiveness of three\nentries in _Henslowe's Diary_ (Collier's ed.) for any discussion of the\ndate of _Bussy D'Ambois_. In Henslowe's \"Enventorey of all the aparell\nof the Lord Admirals men, taken the 13th of Marcher 1598,\" is an item,\n\"Perowes sewt, which Wm Sley were.\" (_Henslowe's Diary_, ed. Collier, p.\n275.) In no extant play save _Bussy D'Ambois_ is a character called Pero\nintroduced. Moreover, Henslowe (pp. 113 and 110) has the following\nentries: \"Lent unto Wm Borne, the 19 of novembr 1598 . . . the some of\nxijs, wch he sayd yt was to Imbrader his hatte for the Gwisse. Lent Wm\nBirde, ales Borne, the 27 of novembr, to bye a payer of sylke stockens,\nto playe the Gwisse in xxs.\" Taken by themselves these two allusions to\nthe \"Gwisse\" might refer, as Collier supposed, to Marlowe's _The\nMassacre at Paris_. But when combined with the mention of Pero earlier\nin the year, they may equally well refer to the Guise in _Bussy\nD'Ambois_. Can _Bussy D'Ambois_ have been the unnamed \"tragedie\" by\nChapman, for the first three Acts of which Henslowe lent him iijli on\nJan. 4, 1598, followed by a similar sum on Jan. 8th, \"in fulle payment\nfor his tragedie?\" The words which Dekker quotes in _Satiromastix_, Sc 7\n(1602), \"For trusty D'Amboys now the deed is done,\" seem to be a line\nfrom a play introducing D'Ambois. If, however, the play was written\ncirca 1598, it must have been considerably revised after the accession\nof James I to the throne, for the allusions to Elizabeth as an \"old\nQueene\" (1, 2, 12), and to Bussy as being mistaken for \"a knight of the\nnew edition,\" must have been written after the accession of James I\n(_Chronicle of the English Drama_, 1, 59). But Mr Fleay's further\nstatement that the words, \"Tis leape yeere\" (1, 2, 85), \"must apply to\nthe date of production,\" and \"fix the time of representation to 1604,\"\nis only an ingenious conjecture. If the words \"Ile be your ghost to\nhaunt you,\" etc (1, 2, 243-244), refer to _Macbeth_, as I have suggested\nin the note on the passage, they point to a revision of the play not\nearlier than the latter part of 1606.\n\n[xxxvii-1] \"Hence a deadly feud arose between the kin of Bussy and\nMontsurry. The task of carrying this into action was undertaken by Jean\nMontluc Baligny, who had married the murdered man's sister, a\nhigh-spirited woman who fanned the flame of her husband's wrath. With\ndifficulty, after a period of nine years, was an arrangement come to\nbetween him and Montsurry on specified terms by the order of the King.\"\n\n[xxxvii-2] \"Ren\u00c3\u00a9e, his sister, a high-souled woman, and of aspirations\nloftier than those of her sex, brooked it very ill that this injury, of\nwhich his brother and nearest kin took no heed, should remain unavenged.\nWhen, therefore, Baligny profferred himself as an avenger, she agreed to\nmarry him, in defiance of the admonitions of her family.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE TEXT\n\n\n_Bussy D'Ambois_ was first printed in quarto in 1607 by W. Aspley, and\nwas reissued in 1608. In 1641, seven years after Chapman's death, Robert\nLunne published another edition in quarto of the play, which, according\nto the title-page, was \"much corrected and amended by the Author before\nhis death.\" This quarto differs essentially from its predecessors. It\nomits and adds numerous passages, and makes constant minor changes in\nthe text. The revised version is not appreciably superior to the\noriginal draft, but, on the evidence of the title-page, it must be\naccepted as authoritative. It was reissued by Lunne, with a different\nimprint, in 1646, and by J. Kirton, with a new title-page, in 1657.\nCopies of the 1641 quarto differ in unimportant details such as\n_articular_, _articulat_, for evidently some errors were corrected as\nthe edition passed through the press. Some copies of the 1646 quarto\nduplicate the uncorrected copies of the 1641 quarto.\n\nIn a reprint of Chapman's Tragedies and Comedies, published by J.\nPearson in 1873, the anonymous editor purported to \"follow mainly\" the\ntext of 1641, but collation with the originals shows that he transcribed\nthat of 1607, substituting the later version where the two quartos\ndiffered, but retaining elsewhere the spelling of the earlier one. Nor\nis his list of variants complete. There have been also three editions of\nthe play in modernized spelling by C. W. Dilke in 1814, R. H. Shepherd\nin 1874, and W. L. Phelps in 1895, particulars of which are given in the\nBibliography. The present edition is therefore the first to reproduce\nthe authoritative text unimpaired. The original spelling has been\nretained, though capitalization has been modernized, and the use of\nitalics for personal names has not been preserved. But the chaotic\npunctuation has been throughout revised, though, except to remove\nambiguity, I have not interfered with one distinctive feature, an\nexceptionally frequent use of brackets. In a few cases of doubtful\ninterpretation, the old punctuation has been given in the footnotes.\n\nDilke, though the earliest of the annotators, contributed most to the\nelucidation of allusions and obsolete phrases. While seeking to\nsupplement his and his successors' labours in this direction, I have\nalso attempted a more perilous task--the interpretation of passages\nwhere the difficulty arises from the peculiar texture of Chapman's\nthought and style. Such a critical venture seems a necessary preliminary\nif we are ever to sift truth from falsehood in Dryden's\nindictment--indolently accepted by many critics as conclusive--of _Bussy\nD'Ambois_.\n\nThe group of quartos of 1641, 1646, and 1657, containing Chapman's\nrevised text, is denoted by the symbol \"B\"; those of 1607 and 1608 by\n\"A.\" In the footnotes all the variants contained in A are given except\nin a few cases where the reading of A has been adopted in the text and\nthat of B recorded as a variant. I have preferred the reading of A to B,\nwhen it gives an obviously better sense, or is metrically superior. I\nhave also included in the Text fifty lines at the beginning of Act II,\nScene 2, which are found only in A. Some slight conjectural emendations\nhave been attempted which are distinguished by \"emend. ed.\" in the\nfootnotes. In these cases the reading of the quartos, if unanimous, is\ndenoted by \"Qq.\"\n\nIn the quartos the play is simply divided into five Acts. These I have\nsubdivided into Scenes, within which the lines have been numbered to\nfacilitate reference. The stage directions in B are numerous and\nprecise, and I have made only a few additions, which are enclosed in\nbrackets. The quartos vary between _Bussy_ and _D'Ambois_, and between\n_Behemoth_ and _Spiritus_, as a prefix to speeches. I have kept to the\nformer throughout in either case.\n\n                                                           F. S.

Extracts\nfrom De Thou's _Historiae sui temporis_ and Rosset's _Histoires\nTragiques_, which tell the tale of Bussy's amorous intrigue and his\nassassination, have also been reprinted as an Appendix. But both these\nnarratives are later than the play. Seneca's representation in the\n_Hercules Oetaeus_ of the Greek hero's destruction by treachery gave\nChapman suggestions for his treatment of the final episode in Bussy's\ncareer (cf. V, 4, 100-108, and note).\n\n\n\n\nPROLOGUE\n\n\n  _Not out of confidence that none but wee\n  Are able to present this tragedie,\n  Nor out of envie at the grace of late\n  It did receive, nor yet to derogate\n  From their deserts, who give out boldly that                         5\n  They move with equall feet on the same flat;\n  Neither for all, nor any of such ends,\n  We offer it, gracious and noble friends,\n  To your review; wee, farre from emulation,\n  And (charitably judge) from imitation,                              10\n  With this work entertaine you, a peece knowne,\n  And still beleev'd, in Court to be our owne.\n  To quit our claime, doubting our right or merit,\n  Would argue in us poverty of spirit\n  Which we must not subscribe to: Field is gone,                      15\n  Whose action first did give it name, and one\n  Who came the neerest to him, is denide\n  By his gray beard to shew the height and pride\n  Of D'Ambois youth and braverie; yet to hold\n  Our title still a foot, and not grow cold                           20\n  By giving it o're, a third man with his best\n  Of care and paines defends our interest;\n  As Richard he was lik'd, nor doe wee feare,\n  In personating D'Ambois, hee'le appeare\n  To faint, or goe lesse, so your free consent,                       25\n  As heretofore, give him encouragement._\n\n\nLINENOTES:\n\n              _Prologue._ The Prologue does not appear in A.\n\n          10  (_charitably judge_).

Our French Court\n  Is a meere mirror of confusion to it:\n  The king and subject, lord and every slave,\n  Dance a continuall haie; our roomes of state\n  Kept like our stables; no place more observ'd                       30\n  Than a rude market-place: and though our custome\n  Keepe this assur'd confusion from our eyes,\n  'Tis nere the lesse essentially unsightly,\n  Which they would soone see, would they change their forme\n  To this of ours, and then compare them both;                        35\n  Which we must not affect, because in kingdomes,\n  Where the Kings change doth breed the subjects terror,\n  Pure innovation is more grosse than error.\n\n  _Mont._ No question we shall see them imitate\n  (Though a farre off) the fashions of our Courts,                    40\n  As they have ever ap't us in attire;\n  Never were men so weary of their skins,\n  And apt to leape out of themselves as they;\n  Who, when they travell to bring forth rare men,\n  Come home delivered of a fine French suit:                          45\n  Their braines lie with their tailors, and get babies\n  For their most compleat issue; hee's sole heire\n  To all the morall vertues that first greetes\n  The light with a new fashion, which becomes them\n  Like apes, disfigur'd with the attires of men.                      50\n\n  _Henr._ No question they much wrong their reall worth\n  In affectation of outlandish scumme;\n  But they have faults, and we more: they foolish-proud\n  To jet in others plumes so haughtely;\n  We proud that they are proud of foolerie,                           55\n  Holding our worthes more compleat for their vaunts.\n\n          _Enter Monsieur, D'Ambois._\n\n  _Monsieur._ Come, mine owne sweet heart, I will enter thee.\n  Sir, I have brought a gentleman to court;\n  And pray, you would vouchsafe to doe him grace.\n\n  _Henr._ D'Ambois, I thinke.\n\n  _Bussy._                    That's still my name, my lord,          60\n  Though I be something altered in attire.\n\n  _Henr._ We like your alteration, and must tell you,\n  We have expected th'offer of your service;\n  For we (in feare to make mild vertue proud)\n  Use not to seeke her out in any man.                                65\n\n  _Buss._ Nor doth she use to seeke out any man:\n  He that will winne, must wooe her: she's not shameless.\n\n  _Mons._ I urg'd her modestie in him, my lord,\n  And gave her those rites that he sayes shee merits.\n\n  _Henr._ If you have woo'd and won, then, brother, weare him.        70\n\n  _Mons._ Th'art mine, sweet heart! See, here's the Guises Duches;\n  The Countesse of Mountsurreaue, Beaupre.\n  Come, I'le enseame thee. Ladies, y'are too many\n  To be in counsell: I have here a friend\n  That I would gladly enter in your graces.                           75\n\n  _Buss._ 'Save you, ladyes!\n\n  _Duchess._ If you enter him in our graces, my\n  lord, me thinkes, by his blunt behaviour he should\n  come out of himselfe.\n\n  _Tamyra._ Has he never beene courtier, my                           80\n  lord?\n\n  _Mons._ Never, my lady.\n\n  _Beaupre._ And why did the toy take him inth'\n  head now?\n\n  _Buss._ Tis leape yeare, lady, and therefore very                   85\n  good to enter a courtier.\n\n  _Henr._ Marke, Duchesse of Guise, there is\n  one is not bashfull.\n\n  _Duch._ No my lord, he is much guilty of the\n  bold extremity.                                                     90\n\n  _Tam._ The man's a courtier at first sight.\n\n  _Buss._ I can sing pricksong, lady, at first\n  sight; and why not be a courtier as suddenly?\n\n  _Beaup._ Here's a courtier rotten before he be\n  ripe.                                                               95\n\n  _Buss._ Thinke me not impudent, lady; I am\n  yet no courtier; I desire to be one and would\n  gladly take entrance, madam, under your\n  princely colours.\n\n          _Enter Barrisor, L'Anou, Pyrhot._\n\n  _Duch._ Soft sir, you must rise by degrees, first                  100\n  being the servant of some common Lady or\n  Knights wife, then a little higher to a Lords\n  wife; next a little higher to a Countesse; yet a\n  little higher to a Duchesse, and then turne the\n  ladder.                                                            105\n\n  _Buss._ Doe you alow a man then foure mistresses,\n  when the greatest mistresse is alowed\n  but three servants?\n\n  _Duch._ Where find you that statute sir.\n\n  _Buss._ Why be judged by the groome-porters.                       110\n\n  _Duch._ The groome-porters!\n\n  _Buss._ I, madam, must not they judge of all\n  gamings i'th' Court?\n\n  _Duch._ You talke like a gamester.\n\n  _Gui._ Sir, know you me?                                           115\n\n  _Buss._ My lord!\n\n  _Gui._ I know not you; whom doe you serve?\n\n  _Buss._ Serve, my lord!\n\n  _Gui._ Go to companion; your courtship's too\n  saucie.                                                            120\n\n  _Buss._ Saucie! Companion! tis the Guise,\n  but yet those termes might have beene spar'd of\n  the guiserd. Companion! He's jealous, by this\n  light. Are you blind of that side, Duke? Ile\n  to her againe for that. Forth, princely mistresse,                 125\n  for the honour of courtship. Another riddle.\n\n  _Gui._ Cease your courtshippe, or, by heaven,\n  Ile cut your throat.\n\n  _Buss._ Cut my throat? cut a whetstone, young\n  Accius Noevius! Doe as much with your                              130\n  tongue as he did with a rasor. Cut my throat!\n\n  _Barrisor._ What new-come gallant have wee\n  heere, that dares mate the Guise thus?\n\n  _L'Anou._ Sfoot, tis D'Ambois! the Duke mistakes\n  him (on my life) for some Knight of the                            135\n  new edition.\n\n  _Buss._ Cut my throat! I would the King\n  fear'd thy cutting of his throat no more than I\n  feare thy cutting of mine.\n\n  _Gui._ Ile doe't, by this hand.                                    140\n\n  _Buss._ That hand dares not doe't; y'ave cut\n  too many throats already, Guise, and robb'd the\n  realme of many thousand soules, more precious\n  than thine owne. Come, madam, talk on. Sfoot,\n  can you not talk? Talk on, I say. Another                          145\n  riddle.\n\n  _Pyrhot._ Here's some strange distemper.\n\n  _Bar._ Here's a sudden transmigration with\n  D'Ambois, out of the Knights ward into the\n  Duches bed.                                                        150\n\n  _L'An._ See what a metamorphosis a brave\n  suit can work.\n\n  _Pyr._ Slight! step to the Guise, and discover\n  him.\n\n  _Bar._ By no meanes; let the new suit work;                        155\n  wee'll see the issue.\n\n  _Gui._ Leave your courting.\n\n  _Buss._ I will not. I say, mistresse, and I will\n  stand unto it, that if a woman may have three\n  servants, a man may have threescore mistresses.                    160\n\n  _Gui._ Sirrha, Ile have you whipt out of the\n  Court for this insolence.\n\n  _Buss._ Whipt! Such another syllable out a\n  th'presence, if thou dar'st, for thy Dukedome.\n\n  _Gui._ Remember, poultron!                                         165\n\n  _Mons._ Pray thee forbeare!\n\n  _Buss._ Passion of death! Were not the King\n  here, he should strow the chamber like a rush.\n\n  _Mons._ But leave courting his wife then.\n\n  _Buss._ I wil not: Ile court her in despight of                    170\n  him. Not court her! Come madam, talk on;\n  feare me nothing. [_To Guise._] Well mai'st\n  thou drive thy master from the Court, but never\n  D'Ambois.\n\n  _Mons._ His great heart will not down, tis like the sea,           175\n  That partly by his owne internall heat,\n  Partly the starrs daily and nightly motion,\n  Their heat and light, and partly of the place\n  The divers frames, but chiefly by the moone,\n  Bristled with surges, never will be wonne,                         180\n  (No, not when th'hearts of all those powers are burst)\n  To make retreat into his setled home,\n  Till he be crown'd with his owne quiet fome.\n\n  _Henr._ You have the mate. Another?\n\n  _Gui._                              No more.    _Flourish short._\n\n          _Exit Guise; after him the King, Mons[ieur] whispering._\n\n  _Bar._ Why here's the lion skar'd with the                         185\n  throat of a dunghill cock, a fellow that has\n  newly shak'd off his shackles; now does he\n  crow for that victory.\n\n  _L'An._ Tis one of the best jiggs that ever\n  was acted.                                                         190\n\n  _Pyr._ Whom does the Guise suppose him to\n  be, troe?\n\n  _L'An._ Out of doubt, some new denizond\n  Lord, and thinks that suit newly drawne out a\n  th' mercers books.                                                 195\n\n  _Bar._ I have heard of a fellow, that by a fixt\n  imagination looking upon a bulbaiting, had a\n  visible paire of hornes grew out of his forhead:\n  and I beleeve this gallant overjoyed with the\n  conceit of Monsieurs cast suit, imagines himselfe                  200\n  to be the Monsieur.\n\n  _L'An._ And why not? as well as the asse\n  stalking in the lions case, bare himselfe like a\n  lion, braying all the huger beasts out of the\n  forrest?                                                           205\n\n  _Pyr._ Peace! he looks this way.\n\n  _Bar._ Marrie, let him look, sir; what will you\n  say now if the Guise be gone to fetch a blanquet\n  for him?\n\n  _L'An._ Faith, I beleeve it, for his honour sake.                  210\n\n  _Pyr._ But, if D'Ambois carrie it cleane?        _Exeunt Ladies._\n\n  _Bar._ True, when he curvets in the blanquet.\n\n  _Pyr._ I, marrie, sir.\n\n  _L'An._ Sfoot, see how he stares on's.\n\n  _Bar._ Lord blesse us, let's away.                                 215\n\n  _Buss._ Now, sir, take your full view: who\n  does the object please ye?\n\n  _Bar._ If you aske my opinion, sir, I think\n  your suit sits as well as if't had beene made for\n  you.                                                               220\n\n  _Buss._ So, sir, and was that the subject of your\n  ridiculous joylity?\n\n  _L'An._ What's that to you, sir?\n\n  _Buss._ Sir, I have observ'd all your fleerings;\n  and resolve your selves yee shall give a strickt                   225\n  account for't.\n\n          _Enter Brisac, Melynell._\n\n  _Bar._ O miraculous jealousie! Doe you think\n  your selfe such a singular subject for laughter\n  that none can fall into the matter of our merriment\n  but you?                                                           230\n\n  _L'An._ This jealousie of yours, sir, confesses\n  some close defect in your selfe that wee never\n  dream'd of.\n\n  _Pyr._ Wee held discourse of a perfum'd asse,\n  that being disguis'd in a lions case imagin'd                      235\n  himself a lion: I hope that toucht not you.\n\n  _Buss._ So, sir? Your descants doe marvellous\n  well fit this ground; we shall meet where your\n  buffonly laughters will cost ye the best blood in\n  your bodies.                                                       240\n\n  _Bar._ For lifes sake, let's be gone; hee'll kill's\n  outright else.\n\n  _Buss._ Goe, at your pleasures; Ile be your\n  ghost to haunt you; and yee sleepe an't, hang\n  me.                                                                245\n\n  _L'An._ Goe, goe, sir; court your mistresse.\n\n  _Pyr._ And be advis'd; we shall have odds\n  against you.\n\n  _Buss._ Tush, valour stands not in number: Ile\n  maintaine it that one man may beat three boyes.                    250\n\n  _Brisac._ Nay, you shall have no ods of him in\n  number, sir; hee's a gentleman as good as the\n  proudest of you, and yee shall not wrong him.\n\n  _Bar._ Not, sir?\n\n  _Melynell._ Not, sir; though he be not so rich,                    255\n  hee's a better man than the best of you; and I\n  will not endure it.\n\n  _L'An._ Not you, sir?\n\n  _Bris._ No, sir, nor I.\n\n  _Buss._ I should thank you for this kindnesse,                     260\n  if I thought these perfum'd musk-cats (being\n  out of this priviledge) durst but once mew at us.\n\n  _Bar._ Does your confident spirit doubt that,\n  sir?

Speak boldly, and be\n  sure of all things I have sworne to thee.\n\n  _Pero._ Building on that assurance (my lord) I\n  may speak; and much the rather because my                          195\n  lady hath not trusted me with that I can tell\n  you; for now I cannot be said to betray her.\n\n  _Mons._ That's all one, so wee reach our\n  objects: forth, I beseech thee.\n\n  _Per._ To tell you truth, my lord, I have made                     200\n  a strange discovery.\n\n  _Mons._ Excellent Pero, thou reviv'st me; may I\n  sink quick to perdition if my tongue discover it!\n\n  _Per._ Tis thus, then: this last night my lord\n  lay forth, and I, watching my ladies sitting up,                   205\n  stole up at midnight from my pallat, and (having\n  before made a hole both through the wall and\n  arras to her inmost chamber) I saw D'Ambois\n  and her selfe reading a letter!\n\n  _Mons._ D'Ambois!                                                  210\n\n  _Per._ Even he, my lord.\n\n  _Mons._ Do'st thou not dreame, wench?\n\n  _Per._ I sweare he is the man.\n\n  _Mons._ The devill he is, and thy lady his dam!\n  Why this was the happiest shot that ever flewe;                    215\n  the just plague of hypocrisie level'd it. Oh, the\n  infinite regions betwixt a womans tongue and\n  her heart! is this our Goddesse of chastity? I\n  thought I could not be so sleighted, if she had\n  not her fraught besides, and therefore plotted this                220\n  with her woman, never dreaming of D'Amboys.\n  Deare Pero, I will advance thee for ever: but\n  tell me now--Gods pretious, it transformes mee\n  with admiration--sweet Pero, whom should she\n  trust with this conveyance? Or, all the dores                      225\n  being made sure, how should his conveyance be\n  made?\n\n  _Per._ Nay, my lord, that amazes me: I cannot\n  by any study so much as guesse at it.\n\n  _Mons._ Well, let's favour our apprehensions                       230\n  with forbearing that a little; for, if my heart\n  were not hoopt with adamant, the conceipt of\n  this would have burst it: but heark thee.             _Whispers._\n\n  _Mont._ I pray thee, resolve mee: the Duke\n  will never imagine that I am busie about's wife:                   235\n  hath D'Ambois any privy accesse to her?\n\n  _An._ No, my lord, D'Ambois neglects her (as\n  shee takes it) and is therefore suspicious that\n  either your lady, or the lady Beaupre, hath\n  closely entertain'd him.                                           240\n\n  _Mont._ Ber lady, a likely suspition, and very\n  neere the life--especially of my wife.\n\n  _Mons._ Come, we'l disguise all with seeming\n  onely to have courted.--Away, dry palm! sh'as\n  a livor as dry as a bisket; a man may goe a                        245\n  whole voyage with her, and get nothing but\n  tempests from her windpipe.\n\n  _Gui._ Here's one (I think) has swallowed a\n  porcupine, shee casts pricks from her tongue so.\n\n  _Mont._ And here's a peacock seemes to have                        250\n  devour'd one of the Alpes, she has so swelling\n  a spirit, & is so cold of her kindnes.\n\n  _Char._ We are no windfalls, my lord; ye must\n  gather us with the ladder of matrimony, or we'l\n  hang till we be rotten.                                            255\n\n  _Mons._ Indeed, that's the way to make ye right\n  openarses. But, alas, ye have no portions fit for\n  such husbands as we wish you.\n\n  _Per._ Portions, my lord! yes, and such portions\n  as your principality cannot purchase.                              260\n\n  _Mons._ What, woman, what are those portions?\n\n  _Per._ Riddle my riddle, my lord.\n\n  _Mons._ I, marry, wench, I think thy portion\n  is a right riddle; a man shall never finde it out:\n  but let's heare it.                                                265\n\n  _Per._ You shall, my lord.\n  _What's that, that being most rar's most cheap?\n  That when you sow, you never reap?\n  That when it growes most, most you [th]in it,\n  And still you lose it, when you win it?                            270\n  That when tis commonest, tis dearest,\n  And when tis farthest off, 'tis neerest?_\n\n  _Mons._ Is this your great portion?\n\n  _Per._ Even this, my lord.\n\n  _Mons._ Beleeve me, I cannot riddle it.                            275\n\n  _Per._ No, my lord; tis my chastity, which you\n  shall neither riddle nor fiddle.\n\n  _Mons._ Your chastity! Let me begin with the\n  end of it; how is a womans chastity neerest\n  man, when tis furthest off?                                        280\n\n  _Per._ Why, my lord, when you cannot get it,\n  it goes to th'heart on you; and that I think comes\n  most neere you: and I am sure it shall be farre\n  enough off. And so wee leave you to our mercies.  _Exeunt Women._\n\n  _Mons._ Farewell, riddle.                                          285\n\n  _Gui._ Farewell, medlar.\n\n  _Mont._ Farewell, winter plum.\n\n  _Mons._ Now, my lords, what fruit of our inquisition?\n  feele you nothing budding yet? Speak,\n  good my lord Montsurry.                                            290\n\n  _Mont._ Nothing but this: D'Ambois is thought\n  negligent in observing the Duchesse, and therefore\n  she is suspicious that your neece or my wife\n  closely entertaines him.\n\n  _Mons._ Your wife, my lord! Think you that                         295\n  possible?\n\n  _Mont._ Alas, I know she flies him like her\n  last houre.\n\n  _Mons._ Her last houre? Why that comes upon\n  her the more she flies it. Does D'Ambois so,                       300\n  think you?\n\n  _Mont._ That's not worth the answering. Tis\n  miraculous to think with what monsters womens\n  imaginations engrosse them when they are once\n  enamour'd, and what wonders they will work                         305\n  for their satisfaction. They will make a sheepe\n  valiant, a lion fearefull.\n\n  _Mons._ And an asse confident. Well, my lord,\n  more will come forth shortly; get you to the\n  banquet.                                                           310\n\n  _Gui._ Come, my lord, I have the blind side of\n  one of them.                        _Exit Guise cum Mont[surry]._\n\n  _Mons._ O the unsounded sea of womens bloods,\n  That when tis calmest, is most dangerous!\n  Not any wrinkle creaming in their faces,                           315\n  When in their hearts are Scylla and Caribdis,\n  Which still are hid in dark and standing foggs,\n  Where never day shines, nothing ever growes\n  But weeds and poysons that no states-man knowes;\n  Nor Cerberus ever saw the damned nookes                            320\n  Hid with the veiles of womens vertuous lookes.\n  But what a cloud of sulphur have I drawne\n  Up to my bosome in this dangerous secret!\n  Which if my hast with any spark should light\n  Ere D'Ambois were engag'd in some sure plot,                       325\n  I were blowne up; he would be, sure, my death.\n  Would I had never knowne it, for before\n  I shall perswade th'importance to Montsurry,\n  And make him with some studied stratagem\n  Train D'Ambois to his wreak, his maid may tell it;                 330\n  Or I (out of my fiery thirst to play\n  With the fell tyger up in darknesse tyed,\n  And give it some light) make it quite break loose.\n  I feare it, afore heaven, and will not see\n  D'Ambois againe, till I have told Montsurry,                       335\n  And set a snare with him to free my feares.\n  Whose there?\n\n          _Enter Maffe._\n\n  _Maffe._     My lord?\n\n  _Mons._               Goe, call the Count Montsurry,\n  And make the dores fast; I will speak with none\n  Till he come to me.\n\n  _Maf._              Well, my lord.                    _Exiturus._\n\n  _Mons._                            Or else\n  Send you some other, and see all the dores                         340\n  Made safe your selfe, I pray; hast, flie about it.\n\n  _Maf._ You'l speak with none but with the Count Montsurry?\n\n  _Mons._ With none but hee, except it be the Guise.\n\n  _Maf._ See, even by this there's one exception more;\n  Your Grace must be more firme in the command,                      345\n  Or else shall I as weakly execute.\n  The Guise shall speak with you?\n\n  _Mons._                         He shall, I say.\n\n  _Maf._ And Count Montsurry?\n\n  _Mons._                     I, and Count Montsurry.\n\n  _Maf._ Your Grace must pardon me, that I am bold\n  To urge the cleare and full sence of your pleasure;                350\n  Which when so ever I have knowne, I hope\n  Your Grace will say I hit it to a haire.\n\n  _Mons._ You have.\n\n  _Maf._            I hope so, or I would be glad--\n\n  _Mons._ I pray thee, get thee gone; thou art so tedious\n  In the strick't forme of all thy services                          355\n  That I had better have one negligent.\n  You hit my pleasure well, when D'Ambois hit you;\n  Did you not, think you?\n\n  _Maf._                  D'Ambois!

The play had evidently been performed, not long before 1641,\nby a company which had not possessed original acting rights in it. The\nperformance had been successful (cf. ll. 3-4 \"the grace of late It did\nreceive\"), and the \"King's men,\" while not claiming a monopoly in it,\nnor seeking to detract from their rivals' merits, felt bound to revive\nthe play on their own account, lest they should seem to be letting their\nclaim go by default. It is possible that in ll. 11-12, they refer to a\nperformance that in vindication of this claim they had given at Court,\nwhile, as further evidence of their priority of interest, they remind\nthe audience of the actors belonging to the company who had appeared in\nthe title-r\u00c3\u00b4le. Nathaniel Field (l. 15), born in 1587, had as a boy been\none of the \"Children of the Queen's Revels,\" and had performed in\nJonson's _Cynthia's Revels_, 1600, and _Poetaster_, 1601. He seems to\nhave joined the King's players soon after 1614, and his name appears in\nthe list of \"the principall actors in all these playes\" prefixed to the\nfirst Shakespearean Folio of 1623. Not long after this period, Field,\nwho by his _Woman is a Weathercock_ (1612) and his _Amends for Ladies_\n(1618) had made a reputation as a dramatist as well as an actor, is\nbelieved to have retired from the stage, though he lived till 1633. If,\nhowever, he did not appear as Bussy till after 1614, when the play had\nalready been at least seven years, perhaps considerably longer, on the\nboards, it can scarcely be said with truth that his \"action first did\ngive it name\" (l. 16). His successor in the part, whom the \"gray beard\"\n(l. 18) of advancing years had now disqualified, cannot be identified;\nbut the \"third man\" (l. 21) is probably Ilyard Swanston, who, according\nto Fleay (_Biog. Chron. of Drama_, vol. I, p. 60), was one of the\n\"King's men\" from 1625 to 1642. His impersonation of Bussy is\nfavourably referred to by Edmund Gayton in his _Festivous Notes upon Don\nQuixote_ (1654), p. 25 and his previous r\u00c3\u00b4le of \"Richard\" (l. 23) may\nhave been that of Ricardo in Massinger's _Picture_, which he had played\nin 1629 (cf. Phelps, _Geo. Chap._ p. 125). The earlier editors thought\nthat Charles Hart was here alluded to, but Wright in his _Historia\nHistrionica_ states it was the part of the Duchess in Shirley's\n_Cardinal_, licensed 1641, that first gave him any reputation. Hence he\ncannot at this date have performed Bussy; his fame in the part was made\nafter the Restoration (cf. Introduction, p. xxv).\n\n=5-6=, 1-33. =Fortune . . . port.= This opening speech of Bussy\nillustrates the difficult compression of Chapman's style and the\ndiversion of his thought from strictly logical sequence by his excessive\nuse of simile. He begins (ll. 1-4) by emphasising the paradoxical\ncharacter of human affairs, in which only those escape poverty who are\nabnormal, while it is among the necessitous that worthily typical\nrepresentatives of the race must be sought. The former class, under the\ndesignation of \"great men,\" are then (after a parenthetical comparison\nwith cedars waxing amidst tempests) likened to statuaries who are\nsatisfied if the exterior of the Colossus they are creating is\nsufficiently imposing; they are then (by an awkward transition of the\nimagery) likened to the statues themselves (l. 15) \"heroique\" in form\nbut \"morter, flint, and lead\" within. Chapman's meaning is here obvious\nenough, but it is a singular canon of \u00c3\u00a6sthetics that estimates the worth\nof a statue by the materials out of which it is made. In l. 18 a new\nthought is started, that of the transitoriness of life, and the\nperishable nature of its gifts, and as the ocean-voyager needs a\nstay-at-home pilot to steer him safely into port, so the adventurer in\n\"the waves of glassie glory\" (ll. 29-30) is bidden look to \"vertue\" for\nguidance to his desired haven--not exactly the conclusion to be expected\nfrom the opening lines of the speech.\n\n=6=, 23. =To put a girdle . . . world.= The editors all compare _Mid.\nNight's Dream_, I, 1, 175, which Chapman probably had in mind.\n\n=7=, 34. =in numerous state.= A play of words, apparently, on two senses\nof the phrase: (1) the series of numbers, (2) a populous kingdom.\n\n=8=, 59. =gurmundist.= The _N. E. D._ quotes no other example of the\nform \"gurmundist\" for \"gurmond\" = \"gourmand.\"\n\n=9=, 86-87. =set my looks In an eternall brake:= keep my countenance\nperpetually immoveable. A \"brake\" is a piece of framework for holding\nsomething steady.\n\n=15=, 187. =I am a poet.= This is historically true. A poem of some\nlength, _Stances faictes par M. de Bussy_, is quoted by Joubert in his\n_Bussy D'Amboise_, pp. 205-09.\n\n=15=, 194-95. =chaine And velvet jacket:= the symbols of a steward's\noffice.\n\n=16=, 207. =his woodden dagger.= The Elizabethan jester carried the\nwooden dagger or sword, which was often one of the properties of the\n\"Vice\" in the later Moralities and the Interludes.\n\n=17=, =Pyra.= Though this character is mentioned here and elsewhere\namong the _Dramatis Person\u00c3\u00a6_, she takes no part in the dialogue.\n\n=17=, 2. _that English virgin:_ apparently Annable, who is the Duchess\nof Guise's lady-in-waiting (cf. III, 2, 234-40).\n\n=18=, 15. =what's that to:= what has that to do with.\n\n=18=, 16-27. =Assure you . . . confusion to it.= With this encomium on\nElizabeth and her Court compare Crequi's account of Byron's compliments\nto the Queen (_Byron's Conspiracie_, IV, 1).\n\n=19=, 36. =Which we must not affect:= which change, however, we must not\ndesire to take place.\n\n=19=, 39-43. =No question . . . as they.= The travelled Englishman's\naffectation of foreign attire is a stock theme of Elizabethan satire.\nCf. (e. g.) _Merch. of Ven._ I, 2, 78-81.\n\n=19=, 44. =travell.= A pun on the two senses, (1) journey, (2) labour,\nthe latter of which is now distinguished by the spelling \"travail.\"\n\n=21=, 85. =Tis leape yeare.= F. G. Fleay (_Biog. Chron._ I, 59)\nconsiders that this refers \"to the date of production, as Bussy's\nintroduction at Court was in 1569, not a Leap Year,\" and that it \"fixes\nthe time of representation to 1604.\" See _Introduction_.\n\n=22=, 110. =the groome-porters.= Chapman here transfers to the French\nCourt an official peculiar to the English Royal Household till his\nabolition under George III. The function of the groom-porter was to\nfurnish cards and dice for all gaming at Court, and to decide disputes\narising at play.\n\n=23=, 123. =the guiserd.= The play on words here is not clear; \"guiserd\"\nmay be a variant of \"gizzard,\" in which case it would mean the Duke's\nthroat. This is more probable than a \"jingling allusion . . . to\ngoose-herd or gozzard,\" which Dilke suggests.\n\n=23=, 124. =are you blind of that side:= unguarded and assailable in\nthat direction.\n\n=23=, 130. =Accius N\u00c3\u00a6vius:= the augur who cut a whetstone in pieces in\npresence of Tarquinius Priscus.\n\n=23=, 133. =mate:= either _match_ or _put down_, _overcome_. The latter\nsense is more probable, with a punning allusion to the use of the word\nin chess, at which Guise seems to be engaged with the King. Cf. l. 184.\n\n=23=, 135-36. =of the new edition:= of the recent creation. An allusion\nto the lavish creation of knights by James, shortly after his accession.\n\n=24=, 141-42. =y'ave cut too many throats.= An allusion to Guise's share\nin the Massacre of St. Bartholomew. Contrast the references to the\nepisode in _The Revenge_, II, 1, 198-234.\n\n=24=, 149. =the Knights ward.= Dilke thought that the allusion here was\nto the \"poor knights of Windsor,\" but it really refers to a part of the\n\"Counter\" prison in London. Cf. _Eastward Hoe_, V, 2, 54, where Wolf\nsays of Sir Petronel Flash, \"The knight will i' the Knights-Ward, doe\nwhat we can, sir.\" (See Schelling's note.)\n\n=24=, 163-64. =out a th' presence:= outside the presence of the\nSovereign.\n\n=25=, 168. =like a rush.= An allusion to the custom, still prevalent in\nChapman's time, of strewing floors with rushes.\n\n=25=, 178-79. =of the place The divers frames.= An obscure expression,\nwhich may mean: the varied character in different places of the bed of\nthe sea.\n\n=25=, 180-83. =Bristled . . . fome.= The imagery in these lines also\npresents difficulty. D'Ambois's heart is likened to the sea, which,\nonce swollen into billows, will not sink into its original calm till it\nis overspread by the crown or sheet of foam which the waves, after their\nsubsidence, leave behind.\n\n=25=, 184. =You have the mate.= Cf. textual note on I, 1, 153, and note\non =23=, 133, p. 148.\n\n=26=, 208. =a blanquet.= To toss D'Ambois in, as is plain from l. 212.\n\n=26=, 211. =carrie it cleane:= comes off easily superior.\n\n=27=, 237-38. =Your descants . . . this ground.= There is a complicated\nplay on words here. _Descant_ in music is the melodious accompaniment to\na simple theme, the _plainsong_ or _ground_. Hence arises the derived\nmeaning, _a variation on any theme_, _a comment_, often of a censorious\nkind. This, as well as the original meaning, is implied here, while\n_ground_ has, of course, its usual as well as its technical sense.\n\n=28=, 243-44. =Ile be your ghost to haunt you.= May this be an early\nreference to Banquo's ghost? _Macbeth_ was probably produced in 1606,\nthe year before _Bussy D'Ambois_ was printed.\n\n=28=, 261. =musk-cats:= _civet-cats_, and hence, _scented persons_,\n_fops_.\n\n=28=, 262. =this priviledge.= The royal presence-chamber, though the\nKing has left it, is still regarded as inviolable.\n\n=29=. =Henry, Guise, Montsurry and Attendants.= The Qq of 1607 and 1608,\ninstead of _Montsurry and Attendants_, read _Beaumond, Nuncius_.\n_Nuncius_ is a mistake, as he does not enter till after l. 24.\n_Beaumond_ is evidently a courtier, who speaks ll. 105-107 (_Such a life\n. . . of men_), and who goes out with the King after l. 206. In 1641 and\nlater Qq it was apparently thought desirable to leave out this\n\"single-speech\" character and transfer his words to Montsurry; but by an\noversight _Beau._ was left prefixed to the second half of l. 105, and\nthe S. D., _Exit Rex cum Beau._, was retained after l. 206. The editor\nhas therefore substituted _Mont._ for _Beau._ in either case. Montsurry\nbeing thus present at the pardon of Bussy, the 1641 and later Qq leave\nout ll. 1-50 of the next Scene wherein _inter alia_ Montsurry speaks of\nthe pardon as yet undecided, and Guise enters to announce it to him.\n\nDilke in his edition in 1814 thought _Beaumond_ a misprint for\n_Beaupre_, who appears in other scenes, and whom he took to be a man,\ninstead of a woman. Hence he reads _Montsurry, Beaupre and Attendants_\nboth here and after l. 206. The other editors have not realized that\nthere is any discrepancy to be explained.\n\n=29=, 12-13. =bruits it . . . healthfull:= proclaims it through the\nworld to be sound and wholesome.\n\n=31=, 51-52. =Pyrrho's opinion . . . are one.= A sweeping\ngeneralisation, which cannot be accepted as an interpretation of the\ndoctrines of the sceptical philosopher of Elis.\n\n=31=, 54-58. =As Hector . . . speak.= The reference is to _Iliad_, VII,\n54 ff., though Hector is there described as keeping back the Trojans\nwith his spear.\n\n=32=, 60. =Ript up the quarrell:= explained the cause and origin of the\nquarrel (Dilke).\n\n=32=, 63-64. =conclude The others dangers:= might put an end to the\nrisks of their companions by making their single combat cover the whole\nquarrel. _Conclude_ here unites the Elizabethan sense _include_ with the\nordinary meaning _finish_.\n\n=32=, 77-80. =And then . . . never kill.= An anticipation, as Lamb and\nothers have pointed out, of Milton's description of angelic wounds,\n_Par. Lost_, VI, 344-49.\n\n=33=, 84-87. =Thrice pluckt . . . scap't.= The accumulation of personal\npronouns makes the interpretation somewhat difficult: thrice D'Ambois\nplucked at it, and thrice drew on thrusts from Barrisor who darted\nhither and thither like flame, and continued thrusting as D'Ambois\nplucked; yet, incredible to relate, the latter escaped injury.\n\n=33=, 90. =only made more horrid with his wound:= Barrisor being only\nrendered fiercer by his wound. The construction is loose, as\ngrammatically the words should qualify D'Ambois.\n\n=33=, 92. =redoubled in his danger:= thrusting himself into danger for\nthe second time. For this peculiar use of _redoubled_ cf. l. 190, \"on my\nknees redoubled,\" and note.\n\n=33=, 94. =Arden.= Probably to be no more identified here with the\nWarwickshire district of this name than in _As You Like It_. Ardennes\nwould be more appropriate on a Frenchman's lips, but the district\nbelongs to the realm of fancy as much as Armenia in l. 117.\n\n=33=, 97. =he gan to nodde.= An anacoluthon. The construction should be\n\"begin to nodde\" after \"I have seene an oke\" in l. 94, but the\nintervening participial clauses produce irregularity. Similarily in l.\n101 \"he fell\" should be \"fall\" and \"hid\" should be \"hide.\"\n\n=33=, 103-104. =Of ten set . . . Navarre.= The war between Henry III and\nHenry of Navarre continued from 1587 to 1589, but the \"ten set battles\"\nare without historical foundation.\n\n=34=, 105. [=Montsurry.=] See note on stage direction at beginning of\nthe scene.\n\n=34=, 108. =felt report:= probably, account related with feeling.\n\n=34=, 121. =the treasure of his brow:= his horn.\n\n=34=, 122. =shelter of a tree.= Unicorns were supposed to be worsted in\nencounters by their adversaries sheltering behind trees, in which they\nimpaled themselves. Spenser, _F. Q._ II, 5, 10, describes how a lion\ndefeats a unicorn by this stratagem. Cf. _Jul. C\u00c3\u00a6s._ II, 1, 303-04.\n\n                    \"He loves to hear\n     That unicorns may be betray'd with trees.\"\n\n=34=, 128. =th' tw' other=, i. e. Pyrrhot and Melynell.\n\n=35=, 130. =hunt Honour at the view.= A rare metaphorical application of\nthe technical phrase, \"hunt at the view.\"\n\n=35.= [=Exit Nuntius.=] The editor has inserted this, as the Qq do not\nindicate when the Nuncius departs, and, with the entrance of Bussy,\nthere is no further need of him. =bare:= bareheaded.\n\n=35=, 141-44. =If ever Nature . . . one.= Difficult lines, which may be\nparaphrased: if ever Nature's bond maintained its strength, when\nsubjected to the severe test of bridging the distance between sovereign\nand subject, both sprung from the same seed, now prove that in elevated\nstations she can show her nobility.\n\n=36=, 156. =that=, i. e. positive law.\n\n=36=, 157. =prefixing:= settling beforehand.\n\n=36=, 164. =this fact, though of justice:= this action, though done in\nthe name of justice.\n\n=37=, 170. =he=, i. e. his enemy.\n\n=37=, 175-76. =which . . . him:= which is more precious than a human\nlife, which is inferior in value to it, and which was rightly forfeited\nto him through ill-doing.\n\n=37=, 190. =This is a grace.= The grace or boon for which Bussy asks is\nexplained by him in ll. 193-203. \"This\" usually refers to something that\nhas gone before, =on my knees redoubled:= going down for the second time\non my knees--from which he had risen after l. 179.\n\n=37=, 192. =And shall=, i. e. And which grace shall.\n\n=38=, 198-204. =Let me . . . King indeed.= With this assertion of man's\noriginal \"Kingship\" cf. _The Gentleman Usher_, V, 1.\n\n     And what's a prince? Had all been virtuous men,\n     There never had been prince upon the earth,\n     And so no subject: all men had been princes.\n     A virtuous man is subject to no prince,\n     But to his soul and honour.\n\n=38.= [=Exit Rex cum Montsurry.=] See note on stage direction at\nbeginning of this scene.\n\n=40=, 18. =Although she be my ante.= From these words we learn that\nBeaupre is niece to the Duke and Duchess of Guise. Compare III, ii, 188,\nand the reference to \"my lady, your niece\" in the passage in Qq 1607 and\n1608 quoted in the textual note on III, ii, 233.\n\n=42=, 49. =an agent for my bloud:= an instrument in the satisfaction of\nmy passions.\n\n=42=, 57-58. =his retiring . . . aspiring:= his retirement to a position\nof inferiority will satisfy my aspirations.\n\n=43=, 70-71. =Wise wives . . . friend.= Tamyra ironically keeps up the\nmetaphor of the \"two strings\" in l. 66, and plays upon the double senses\nof \"firm\" and \"loose\" in archery and morals.\n\n=44=, 95. =as good cheap as it:= literally, on as advantageous terms as;\nhence, with as little effort as, as readily as.\n\n=45=, 108-10. =Whose there . . . quality.= Cf. _All Fools_, II, 1, p. 67\n(Phelps).\n\n     While I sit like a well-taught writing-woman\n     Turning her eyes upon some work or picture,\n     Read in a book, or take a feigned nap,\n     While her kind lady takes one to her lap.\n\n=45=, 117. =oportunities:= importunities, which Dilke wished to\nsubstitute. But \"opportunity\" was used in this sense. Cf. _Mer. Wiv.\nWind._ III, 4, 20-2.\n\n     \"Yet seeke my Fathers love, still seeke it, sir;\n     If opportunity and humblest suite\n     Cannot attain it, why then harke you hither.\"\n\n=45=, 121-122. =as to their pardons . . . Parliaments.= The meaning\nappears to be: as the exceptions they make, after Parliaments have\nceased to sit, are to the pardons they have granted.\n\n=46=, 129. =part'st with victory:= comest off victoriously.\n\n=48=, 165. =the Center:= the unmoved central point of the earth,\naccording to the Ptolemaic system.\n\n=49=, 182. =cast . . . beene:= undress, as if I had never been watching\nhere. Tamyra here determines to go to bed, but afterwards (l. 242) she\nreturns.\n\n=49=, 198. =the first orbe move.= An allusion to the _Primum Mobile_,\nwhich, in the Ptolemaic system, was the tenth sphere \"of a most pure and\ncleare substance and without starres,\" which revolved in twenty-four\nhours, and carried round in its course all the inner spheres.\n\n=51=, 231-32. =If not . . . satisfi'd:= if she is not given opportunity\nto dissemble or show petulance, she is not satisfied even if she gains\nwhat she desires.\n\n=56=, 20-30. =Sin . . . troth.= A characteristic illustration of how one\nsimile in Chapman's verse begets another, with little regard for logical\nsequence. The \"shadowes\" with which sin frightens us are first compared\nto the imaginary creatures into which fancy shapes the clouds; then sin\nitself (relegated from an active to a passive part) is likened not to a\npure creation of the fancy, but to an exaggerated picture of a real\nmonster displayed by \"policy,\" i. e. the craft which seeks to debar men\nfrom their desires.\n\nFor the custom of exhibiting a rude painting of a curiosity, as a decoy\nto sightseers, cf. _The Tempest_, II, 2, 29-31, \"Were I in England now .\n. . and had but this fish painted, not a holiday fool there but would\ngive a piece of silver.\"\n\n=56=, 21. =in his truest valour:= if his valour be rightly estimated.\n\n=56=, 33. =our three powers.= The vegetative, sensitive and reasoning\nfaculties.\n\n=56-57=, 40-43. =Nor shall . . . wings.= Tamyra's \"fame,\" which in l. 38\nhas been spoken of as a \"jewell,\" is now likened to a fabulous winged\ncreature which is accorded free flight.\n\n=57=, 44. =It rests as:= the secret remains as inviolable as if.\n\n=58=, 69-71. =layes . . . oppos'd.= I am indebted to Dr. J. A. H. Murray\nfor the following interpretation of this passage: [Nature] brings our\npowers into accordance with its own will or working, just as the stone\n(laid by the builder) should be apposed or brought into accord with the\nline, not the line (which is straight and not to be shifted) made to lie\nalong the stone.\n\n=60=, 119. =greatnesse with him:= high place in his favour.\n\n=62=, 13. =Boots of hay-ropes.= Bands of hay were sometimes wrapped\nround the legs, to serve instead of boots. Cf. Ben Jonson's _Every Man\nin his Humour_, I, 2. _Step._ But I have no boots . . . _Brainworm_. Why\na fine wisp of hay roll'd hard, Master Stephen.\n\n=62=, 18. =a redhair'd man:= a deceiver, traitor; so called from the\nrepresentation of Judas in tapestries, and probably on the stage of the\nMiracle plays, with red hair.\n\n=63=, 23. =put them up:= start them from their cover.\n\n=63=, 28. =That . . . clapdish:= That keeps regal state, though sprung\nfrom beggary. A clapdish was a wooden dish with a lid, carried by\nbeggars and lepers, which they clapped to announce their approach.\n\n=63=, 46. =Venting . . . Hebrew:= putting the best product of his\nlivings to the reverse of its intended use. Hebrew is read backwards.\n\n=65=, 69. =that popular purple.= An allusion to the Duke's robe, which\nwas of royal purple, to impress the populace.\n\n=65=, 76. =He's noblier borne.= \"Noblier\" has been here substituted for\n\"nobly.\" The parallel phrases in the preceding lines are all\ncomparatives, \"better,\" \"more,\" \"greater,\" and Bussy, in the second half\nof this line, cannot mean to deny that Guise is of noble birth.\n\n=65=, 79. =Cardinall of Ambois.= The Cardinal Georges d'Amboise was in\nreality Bussy's great-uncle.\n\n=66=, 84. =great in faction:= active in promoting leagues.\n\n=66=, 86-87. =Be a duke . . . field.= A play, of course, on the original\nmeaning of Duke, as _Dux_ or _leader_.\n\n=67=, 108. =the Hermean rod:= the caduceus or rod of Hermes, with which\nhe parted two fighting serpents, whereupon they embraced and stuck to\nthe rod.\n\n=69=, 144-47. =and as this . . . pride.= An allusion to the myth of the\ngiant Typhoeus who, according to one version, was created by Hera alone,\nin anger at the birth of Pallas from the head of Zeus. He was killed by\nZeus with a flash of lighting, and was buried in Tartarus under Mt.\nEtna.\n\n=69=, 154. =make scapes to please advantage:= commit escapades, and\nthereby give points against themselves.\n\n=69=, 155-56. =women . . . candels:= women who make the worst\naccomplices to men.\n\n=70=, 157. =their women:= their waiting-women.\n\n=71=, 187-88. =as far as an unkle may.= Guise is uncle to the lady\nBeaupre. Cf. note on II, 2, 18.\n\n=74=, 243-44. =Come . . . courted.= These words are whispered by\nMonsieur to Pero. The rest of his speech is spoken aloud as if in\ndisgust at the rejection of advances made by him to Pero.\n\n=74=, 244. =dry palm:= a sign of chastity.\n\n=77=, 311. =I have the blind side of:= I can play on the weakness of.\n\n=78=, 325. =engag'd in some sure plot:= involved in the toils of some\nplot securely laid against him.\n\n=78=, 330. =Train . . . wreak:= allure D'Ambois within reach of his\nrevenge.\n\n=80=, 375. =angell of my life:= an allusion to the tutelary genius. For\na similar use of _angel_ cf. _Ant. and Cleop._ II, 3, 21.\n\n=81=, 383. =rais'd without a circle.= If a necromancer, before raising a\nspirit, drew a circle within which he stood, he was secure against its\npower.\n\n=82=, 406. =which I have still in thought:= which is always with me, as\nfar as my thoughts are concerned.\n\n=84=, 445-46. =to force . . . estates.= With the punctuation adopted\n_And . . . throats_ is a clause parenthetically inserted in the main\nstatement, and the meaning is: to get possession of estates by\nforeclosing mortgages, and thus destroying their owners. The Qq have a\ncomma after _possessions_, and no brackets in the following line.\n\n=84-85=, 448-49. =quarrell . . . Ajax.= A reference to the well-known\nepisode in Sophocles' _Ajax_.\n\n=85=, 453. =make them of a peece:= make them complete.\n\n=85=, 464-66. =which not to sooth . . . Thou eat'st.= An anacoluthon.\n\n=85=, 465. =And glorifie . . . Hammon.= Probably an allusion to the\nadoration of Alexander the Great as the son of Jupiter Ammon by the\npriests of this originally \u00c3\u0086thiopian deity, at Thebes in Upper Egypt, in\nB. C. 331.\n\n=86=, 473. =like a scrich-owle sing.= The screech of the owl was\nsupposed to be an omen of death to the hearer. Cf. _Macbeth_, II, 2,\n3-4.\n\n=87=, 500. =to that wall:= at the distance of that wall.\n\n=87=, 507. =her breathing rock.= Dilke explains this as \"the distaff\nfrom whence she draws the thread of life,\" but though this is evidently\nthe meaning required, it is difficult to extract it from this obscure\nphrase.\n\n=87=, 510. =Defil'd . . . soule.= Another instance of confused imagery,\nwhich yields no satisfactory meaning.\n\n=89=, 28. =which=, sc. time.\n\n=90=, 35. =princely mistresse:= the Duchess of Guise.\n\n=90=, 39. =Your servant:= D'Ambois.\n\n=90=, 52. =in high formes:= on stools of disgrace.\n\n=91=, 55. =great eagles beak.= Cf. III, 2, 4.\n\n=91=, 57. =her . . . liver.= A double allusion, as Dilke has pointed\nout, to the story of Prometheus, and to the conception of the liver as\nthe seat of the emotions.\n\n=92=, 77. =with a traine:= by a stratagem.\n\n=93=, 84. =gushing.= Used here transitively, qualifying _laws_, and\ngoverning _blood_.\n\n=93=, 87. =bare . . . hammes:= the uncovered heads and cringing postures\nof sycophants.\n\n=93=, 98. =Armenian dragons.= Chapman is fond of locating fabulous\nmonsters in Armenia. Cf. II, 1, 118-19.\n\n=94=, 115. =almighty \u00c3\u0086ther.= Probably a reminiscence of Virgil,\n_Georg._ 2, 325, _pater omnipotens \u00c3\u0086ther_.\n\n=94=, 120. =Nay, they are two.= Monsieur, while saying this, makes two\nhorns with his fingers.\n\n=95=, 126. =a meere Cynthia:= a perfect moon-goddess.\n\n=96=, 138. =The plague of Herod.= Cf. Acts XII, 23, \"And he was eaten of\nworms, and gave up the ghost.\"\n\n=98=, 180. =thus, with his fingers.= Cf. note on l. 120.\n\n=98=, 181-83. =comes . . . slew:= if he is the source of the blot on my\nhonour, it becomes a beauty, not a blemish, and proves that I posses the\nsame innocence that caused the death of.\n\n=98=, 183. =Chym\u00c3\u00a6ra.= A fire-breathing monster, brought up by\nAmisodarus, King of Caria. She was slain by Bellerophon. This Corinthian\nprince, to purify himself from a murder he had committed, had fled to\nthe court of Proetus of Argos, whose wife, Anteia, fell in love with\nhim. On his rejection of her advances, she made false accusations\nagainst him, whereupon Proetus sent him to his father-in-law, Iobates,\nKing of Lycia, with a sealed letter, requesting him to put him to death.\nIobates sent him to kill Chim\u00c3\u00a6ra, thinking he would be certain to perish\nin the attempt. But mounted on the winged horse Pegasus, he killed her\nfrom on high with his arrows.\n\n=98=, 183-84. =rescued . . . Peleon.= Peleus, King of the Myrmidons,\nduring a visit to Iolcus, attracted the love of Astydameia, the wife of\nAcastus. On his rejection of her proposals, she denounced him falsely to\nher husband, who took him to hunt wild beasts on Mount Peleon, and when\nhe fell asleep through fatigue, concealed his sword, and left him alone\nto be devoured. But he was saved by Cheiron, who restored him his sword.\n\n=98=, 185. =the chaste Athenian prince:= Hippolytus, son of Theseus and\nHippolyta, with whom his step-mother Ph\u00c3\u00a6dra fell in love. On his\nrejection of her advances, she accused him to Theseus, at whose prayer\nPoseidon caused his destruction, by frightening his horses, when he was\ndriving along the seacoast, and overturning his chariot. Afterwards, on\nthe discovery of his innocence, Asclepius restored him to the upper\nworld.\n\n=98=, 187. =Egean.= So the Qq, instead of \"Augean.\"\n\n=98=, 190. =where thou fear'st, are dreadfull:= inspirest terror even in\nthose of whom thou art afraid.\n\n=98-99=, 192-94. =the serpent . . . and me.= A curious application of\nthe legend of armed men springing from the dragon's teeth sown by Jason.\n\n=99=, 204. =feares his owne hand:= is afraid of the consequences of his\nown handwriting.\n\n=99=, 205-208. =papers hold . . . honors:= written documents often\ncontain the revelation of our true selves, and, though of no material\nvalue, put the crown to our reputations.\n\n=99-100=, 209-210. =and with . . . knowes:= and compare with its\ncontents the evidence of this my most intimate attendant.\n\n=101=, 6. =trails hotly of him:= is hot upon his scent. _Him_ apparently\nrefers to _mischiefe_ in l. 4.\n\n=102=, 25. =With . . . affrighted:= by which all things capable of\nterror are frightened.\n\n=103=, 32. =Epimethean.= Epimetheus, the brother of Prometheus, opened\nPandora's box, and let its evils loose among mankind.\n\n=103=, 37-38. =Or stood . . . artillerie.= In the war of Zeus against\nCronos, the Cyclopes aided the former, who had released them from\nTartarus, by furnishing him with thunderbolts.\n\n=103=, 47-48. =I will . . . spirit:= I will command a spirit, raised by\nmy art, to enlighten us.\n\n=104=, 54. =Behemoth.= The editor has been unable to find any precedent\nfor Chapman's application of this name--which in the Book of Job denotes\nthe whale or hippopotamus--to the chief of the powers of darkness.\n\n=104=, 55. =Asaroth.= Apparently a variant of _Ashtaroth_, the plural of\n_Ashtoreth,_ the Phoenician moon-goddess; here mistakenly used for the\nname of a male spirit.\n\n=104.= =Cartophylax.= A post-classical Greek term for \"guardian of\npapers.\"\n\n=106=, 97. =great in our command:= powerful in exercising command over\nus.\n\n=107-109=, 113-51. =There is . . . his soule.= The dialogue and action\nhere take place probably at the back of the stage, perhaps on the upper\nstage, of which use is made in _The Tempest_, the _Spanish Tragedie_,\nand other plays. The characters (as is evident from ll. 102-104) are\nsupposed to be far off, but rendered visible and audible to Tamyra and\nD'Ambois by Behemoth's power.\n\n=107=, 113. =a glasse of ink:= a mirror made of ink, i. e. the paper\nwith the proofs of Tamyra's unfaithfulness.\n\n=107=, 116. =fames sepulchres:= the foulness beneath which her good name\nis buried.\n\n=107=, 120-21. =were . . . rarely:= were it never so uncommon, bear it\nwith as unexampled courage.\n\n=109=, 156. =In her forc'd bloud.= Dilke is followed in the substitution\nof _her_ for _his_. The allusion is evidently to the letter that Tamyra\nafterwards writes to D'Ambois in her own blood. Cf. V, 1, 176-77.\n\n=110=, 169-70. =Lest . . . abuse:= lest a furious outburst due to your\nforeknowledge of the plot against us.\n\n=111=, 185. =And . . . policy:= and the Monsieur's stratagems shall be\ntaken in the flank by my own.\n\n=111=, 186. =Center.= Here and in l. 192 this word, though strictly\nmeaning the central point of the earth, seems used for the earth itself,\nas the centre of the universe. For this use cf. Shaks. _Tro. and Cress._\nI, 3, 85-86.\n\n     \"The heavens themselves, the planets, and this center\n     Observe degree, priority, and place.\"\n\n=111=, 191. =calme . . . ruine:= unsuspecting tranquillity previous to a\nconvulsion of the elements.\n\n=113=, 17-18. =The stony . . . sleeper.= The thunderstone, or\nthunderbolt, was supposed to have no power of harming any one who was\nasleep, or who wore laurel leaves. Leigh, in his _Observations on the\nFirst Twelve C\u00c3\u00a6sars_ (1647), p. 43, says of Tiberius that \"he feared\nthunder exceedingly, and when the aire or weather was any thing\ntroubled, he even carried a chaplet or wreath of laurell about his neck,\nbecause that as (Pliny reporteth) is never blasted with lightning.\"\n\n=114=, 50. =determinate:= apparently used in the sense of _final_,\nthough the sense is rare, except as qualifying a word which implies\nprevious deliberation.\n\n=115=, 55-56. =preventing . . . death:= anticipating the last blast that\nis to kill those who live, and to give life anew to the dead.\n\n=115=, 64. =Fame growes in going.= Borrowed from the _\u00c3\u0086neid_, IV,\n173-75, _Fama . . . viresque acquirit eundo._\n\n=115=, 67-68. =come . . . lust.= The _syren_ is Tamyra; her song the\nletter she is to write to her lover (cf. l. 75); Montsurry; band of\nmurderers the fatal _rocks_; and the _ruffin gally_, D'Ambois.\n\n=115=, 69-71. =the nets . . . danc'd.= There is a play here upon _nets_\nin the sense of wiles, and in its usual signification. To \"dance,\" or\n\"march,\" or \"hide\" in a net was to delude oneself that one was acting\nsecretly (cf. _Henry V_, I, 4, 173, and _Span. Trag._ IV, 4, 118).\n\n=116=, 84. =for all:= in spite of all.\n\n=116=, 86. =their= should be, in grammatical sequence, \"her,\" referring\nto \"a womans\" in 83.\n\n=116=, 91. =nor in humane consort:= nor do they find human fellowship.\nThe metaphor of the _wildernesse_ is still being carried on.\n\n=118=, 128-30. =Where . . . cruelty:= in the same quarter [i. e. your\nperson] where all these bonds have been violated, they are preserved by\nthe infliction of just punishment, with some exhibition of the same\nquintessence of cruelty that you have shown me.\n\n=118=, 142. =Thus I expresse thee yet:= thus I give a further stroke to\nmy delineation of thee.\n\n=118=, 143. =thy . . . yet:= the image of thy unnatural depravity is not\nyet fully completed.\n\n=118=, 145. =This other engine:= the rack, on which Montsurry's servants\nplace Tamyra. Cf. l. 157, \"O let me downe, my lord.\"\n\n=119=, 151-52. =O who . . . None but my lord and husband.= Tamyra thinks\nthat some evil spirit has taken her husband's shape, and cries to\nMontsurry to appear and deliver her.\n\n=119=, 161. =Now . . . stands still.= This statement of the leading\nprinciple of the Copernican system, as a mere rhetorical paradox, is\nremarkable.\n\n=119-120=, 163-72. =The too huge . . . with hypocrisie.= In this curious\npassage the earth is conceived of as a recumbent figure, which usually\nlies face upwards to the sky. But the weight of her sins has caused her\nto roll over, so that her back part now _braves_ heaven, while her face\nis turned to the Antipodes; and all the deceitful appearances which she\nhas adopted through her cheating arts have come out in their true nature\non her back, so that her hypocrisy stands revealed.\n\n=120=, 178. =he:= the Friar.\n\n=120=, 181. =his.= We should expect a repetition of _her_ in l. 180.\n_His_, however seems to be equivalent to _man's_, anticipating _man_ in\nl. 182. Possibly we should read _this_.\n\n=121=, 191. =In, Ile after.= These words are addressed to the body of\nthe Friar.\n\n=122=, 20. =with terror:= inspiring terror in their enemies.\n\n=123=, 28. =And . . . man:= And consider it, though left headless, as a\ncompletely formed man.\n\n=123=, 36. =vertuous treasurie:= stock of virtues.\n\n=124=, 46-53. =Not so . . . mens hate.= An adaptation of Seneca's\n_Agamemnon_, 64-72:\n\n     _Non sic Libycis Syrtibus \u00c3\u00a6quor\n     Furit alternos volvere fluctus,\n     Non Euxini turget ab imis\n     Commota vadis unda, nivali\n     Vicina polo;\n     Ubi, c\u00c3\u00a6ruleis immunis aquis,\n     Lucida versat plaustra Bootes,\n     Ut praecipites regum casus\n     Fortuna rotat._\n\nThese lines, with those immediately before and after, are more loosely\nadapted in Kyd's _Spanish Tragedie_, III, 1, 1-11.\n\n=126=, 23. =this embodied shadow:= this spirit while it had bodily form.\n\n=126=, 24-27. =With reminiscion . . . of art.= Cf. IV, 2, 158-61.\n\n=127=, 41-53. =Terror of darknesse . . . greater light.= After Bussy's\nstatement in ll. 29-32 we should expect him to immediately summon _the\nPrince of darknesse_, Behemoth. But ll. 41-46 are apparently addressed\nto the sun-god, who is invoked to put to flight night and mystery. Then\nas an alternative, in ll. 47-53, Behemoth, to whom darkness is as light,\nis bidden appear. Dilke substitutes _oh_ for _or_ (the reading of all\nQq) at the beginning of l. 47. If this change be right, the invocation\ncommences at this line, and ll. 41-46 are merely a preliminary\nrhetorical appeal for more illumination. But in this case there is an\nincongruity between such an appeal and the summoning of the _Prince of\nshades_, who sees best where darkness is thickest. Lamb in his\n_Specimens_ retains the reading of the Qq, and says of the passage:\n\"This calling upon Light and Darkness for information, but, above all,\nthe description of the spirit--'threw his changed countenance headlong\ninto clouds'--is tremendous, to the curdling of the blood. I know\nnothing in poetry like it.\"\n\n=130=, 103. =all the signes:= i. e. of the Zodiac.\n\n=131.= =Intrat Umbra Frier . . . Tamyra.= The Ghost of the Friar enters\nand _discovers_, i. e. _reveals to view_, Tamyra, who since the close of\nV, 1, has remained wrapped _in the arras_, or, as the variant stage\ndirection in A here puts it, _wrapt in a canapie_.\n\n=131=, 9. =before he be revenged:= before vengeance is taken on him. The\nreading of A, _engaged_, is perhaps (as Dilke suggests) preferable.\n\n=133=, 27-28. =what . . . D'Amboys:= what bugbear, such as this, is not\nafraid to visit D'Amboys, even in his sleep?\n\n=134=, 45. =Will . . . here?= D'Ambois's sword fails to pierce the\n_privy coat_ worn by the murderer.

S.\nfor John Helme. No reprint appeared till 1873, when it was included in\nthe edition of Chapman's Tragedies and Comedies published by J. Pearson.\nThe text of the quarto was reproduced, with the original spelling and\npunctuation, but with a few errors. There have been two later editions\nin modernized spelling, and with slight emendations, by R. H. Shepherd\nin 1874, and W. L. Phelps in 1895.\n\nIn the present edition the text of the quarto has been reproduced, with\nsome additional emendations, and the original spelling has been\nretained. As regards punctuation, the use of capital letters and\nitalics, and the division of the Acts into Scenes, the same methods have\nbeen followed as in the case of _Bussy D'Ambois_.\n\n\n\n\nTHE\nREVENGE\nOF\n_Bussy D'Ambois_.\n\n\nA\nTRAGEDIE\n\n\n_As it hath beene often presented at the\npriuate Play-house in the White Fryers._\n\n\nWritten\nBy GEORGE CHAPMAN, Gentleman.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\nLONDON:\n\nPrinted by _T.

Dunstones Church-Yard,\n              in _Fleetstreet_. 1613.\n\n\n\n\nSOURCES\n\n\nThe story of a plot by Bussy D'Ambois's kinsfolk to avenge his murder\nis, in the main, of Chapman's own invention. But he had evidently read\nan account similar to that given later by De Thou of the design\nentertained for a time by Bussy's sister Ren\u00c3\u00a9e (whom Chapman calls\nCharlotte) and her husband, Baligny, to take vengeance on Montsurry.\nClermont D'Ambois is himself a fictitious character, but the episodes in\nwhich he appears in Acts II-IV are drawn from the account of the\ntreacherous proceedings against the Count d'Auvergne in Edward\nGrimeston's translation of Jean de Serres's _Inventaire G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9ral de\nl'Histoire de France_. This narrative, however, is not by De Serres, but\nby Pierre Matthieu, whose _Histoire de France_ was one of the sources\nused by Grimeston for events later than 1598.\n\nThe portraiture of Clermont throughout the play as the high-souled\nphilosopher is inspired by Epictetus's delineation in his _Discourses_\nof the ideal Stoic. But in his reluctance to carry out his duty of\nrevenge he is evidently modelled upon Hamlet. In Act V, Scene i, the\ninfluence of Shakespeare's tragedy is specially manifest.\n\nThe Scenes in Act V relating to the assassination of Guise are based\nupon Grimeston's translation of De Serres's _Inventaire G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9ral_.\n\nThe passages in Grimeston's volume which recount the Duke's murder, and\nthose which tell the story of the Count d'Auvergne, are reprinted as an\nAppendix.\n\nThe frontispiece to this volume, the Ch\u00c3\u00a2teau of La Coutanci\u00c3\u00a8re, at which\nBussy D'Ambois was killed, is reproduced from an illustration in A.\nJoubert's _Louis de Clermont_.\n\n\n\n\nTO THE RIGHT\n\nVERTUOUS, AND\n\ntruely Noble Knight, Sr.\n\n_Thomas Howard, &c._\n\n\n_Sir_,\n\nSince workes of this kinde have beene lately esteemed\nworthy the patronage of some of our worthiest\nNobles, I have made no doubt to preferre this of mine\nto your undoubted vertue and exceeding true noblesse,\nas contayning matter no lesse deserving your reading,                  5\nand excitation to heroycall life, then any such late dedication.\nNor have the greatest Princes of Italie and other\ncountries conceived it any least diminution to their greatnesse\nto have their names wing'd with these tragicke\nplumes, and disperst by way of patronage through the                  10\nmost noble notices of Europe.\n\nHowsoever, therefore, in the sc\u00c3\u00a6nicall presentation it\nmight meete with some maligners, yet, considering even\ntherein it past with approbation of more worthy judgements,\nthe ballance of their side (especially being held                     15\nby your impartiall hand) I hope will to no graine abide\nthe out-weighing.

But to note the cause\n  Of all these foule digressions and revolts\n  From our first natures, this tis in a word:\n  Since good arts faile, crafts and deceits are us'd:\n  Men ignorant are idle; idle men                                     65\n  Most practise what they most may doe with ease,\n  Fashion and favour; all their studies ayming\n  At getting money, which no wise man ever\n  Fed his desires with.\n\n  _Bal._                Yet now none are wise\n  That thinke not heavens true foolish, weigh'd with that.            70\n  Well, thou most worthy to be greatest Guise,\n  Make with thy greatnesse a new world arise.\n  Such deprest nobles (followers of his)\n  As you, my selfe, my lord, will finde a time\n  When to revenge your wrongs.\n\n  _Ren._                       I make no doubt:                       75\n  In meane time, I could wish the wrong were righted\n  Of your slaine brother in law, brave Bussy D'Ambois.\n\n  _Bal._ That one accident was made my charge.\n  My brother Bussy's sister (now my wife)\n  By no suite would consent to satisfie                               80\n  My love of her with marriage, till I vow'd\n  To use my utmost to revenge my brother:\n  But Clermont D'Ambois (Bussy's second brother)\n  Had, since, his apparition, and excitement\n  To suffer none but his hand in his wreake;                          85\n  Which hee hath vow'd, and so will needes acquite\n  Me of my vow made to my wife, his sister,\n  And undertake himselfe Bussy's revenge.\n  Yet loathing any way to give it act,\n  But in the noblest and most manly course,                           90\n  If th'Earle dares take it, he resolves to send\n  A challenge to him, and my selfe must beare it;\n  To which deliverie I can use no meanes,\n  He is so barricado'd in his house,\n  And arm'd with guard still.\n\n  _Ren._                      That meanes lay on mee,                 95\n  Which I can strangely make.

To the right vertuous . . . Sr. Thomas Howard, &c.= Thomas Howard,\nborn before 1594, was the second son of the first Earl of Suffolk. He\nwas created a Knight of the Bath in January, 1605, and in May, 1614, was\nappointed Master of the Horse to Charles, Prince of Wales. In 1622 he\nbecame Viscount Andover, and in 1626 Earl of Berkshire. He held a number\nof posts till the outbreak of the Civil War, and after the Restoration\nwas appointed Gentleman of the Bedchamber to Charles II, and Privy\nCouncillor. He died on July 16, 1669. His daughter Elizabeth married\nDryden, and his sixth son, Sir Robert Howard, became distinguished as a\ndramatic writer and critic. Chapman addresses to this patron one of the\nSonnets appended to his translation of the _Iliad_, in which he compares\nhim to Antilochus, and calls him \"valiant, and mild, and most\ningenious.\"\n\n=169=, 35-36. =the most divine philosopher.= The reference is doubtless\nto Epictetus, the influence of whose _Discourses_ appears throughout\n_The Revenge of Bussy D'Ambois_.\n\n=174=, 70. =That thinke . . . that=, that do not consider heavenly bliss\ncomplete folly, when compared with money.\n\n=175=, 71-2. =Well . . . arise.= A hypocritical appeal by Baligny to the\nabsent Duke of Guise, of whose ambitious schemes he suspects Renel to be\na supporter.\n\n=175=, 79-82. =My brother . . . brother.= Cf. _Introduction_, p. xxxvii.\n\n=176=, 97. =stands now on price with him:= is now the subject of\nbargaining between him and me.\n\n=178. Monsieur taking leave of the King.= Henry apparently leaves the\nstage, after this formal ceremony of farewell, without speaking, for he\ntakes no part in the dialogue, and he is not mentioned among those who\n_exeunt_ at l. 290.\n\n=178=, 145. =See . . . Brabant.= The expedition of the Duke of Anjou\nhere alluded to is that of 1582, when he was crowned Duke of Brabant at\nAntwerp.\n\n=181=, 202-4. =durst . . . lady.= Cf. _Bussy D'Ambois_, I, ii, 96-179.\n\n=181=, 204-8. =emptied . . . were.= Cf. _Bussy D'Ambois_, III, ii,\n478-515.\n\n=182=, 234-5. =When . . . commanders.= Monsieur's description in these\nand the following lines of Clermont's and Bussy's first appearance at\nCourt is purely fictitious.\n\n=183=, 254. =a keele of sea-coale.= A keel was a flat-bottomed boat,\nused in the northeast of England, for loading and carrying coal.\nAfterwards the word was also used of the amount of coal a keel would\ncarry, i. e. 8 chaldrons, or 21 tons 4 cwt. Sea-coal was the original\nterm for the fossil coal borne from Newcastle to London by sea, to\ndistinguish it from _char-coal_. Cf.

But a great resolution, thinking that there is no more\nharme in fearing, then in the thing that causeth feare, feares extremely\nto make shewe that hee hath any feare.\"\n\n=233=, 24. =Two . . .

V, iv,\n34-5.\n\n=234=, 14-25. =When Homer . . . despis'd.= The editor of the 1873\nedition of Chapman's Plays points out that \"these twelve lines headed\n_Of great men_ appear, with a few unimportant verbal differences, among\nthe Epigrams printed at the end of Chapman's Petrarch in 1612.\"\n\n=234=, 20. =for disposing these:= for regulating these gifts of fame,\nstrength, noble birth, and beauty. _These_ is used loosely to qualify\nthe nouns implied by the adjectives, _Strong'st_, _noblest_, _fairest_,\nin l. 19.\n\n=236=, 56-7. =You can . . . minde.= If the text is correct, the lines\nmean: you can never find means to give attention to externals without\nneglecting the improvement of your mind. Mr. Brereton has suggested to\nthe editor that the true reading may be, _Things out worth care_, in\nwhich case \"out\" = \"outward.\"\n\n=236=, 58-75. =God . . . birth.= A free paraphrase of the _Discourses_\nof Epictetus, bk.

He was educated at Cambridge, and from an early age\nbecame a prominent figure at the Court of Elizabeth, who, it was said in\n1573, \"delighteth more in his personage, and his dancing and\nvaliantness, than any other.\" In 1575 he paid a visit to Italy, and it\nis apparently to an episode on his return journey in the spring of 1576\nthat reference is made here, and in the following lines. The portrait\nhere drawn of him is too flattering, as he was violent in temper and\nextravagant, but the Earl's literary gifts merited the praise of\nChapman. Puttenham and Meres speak highly of him as a writer of comedy,\nand Webbe pays a tribute to his excellence in \"the rare devises of\npoetry.\" Over twenty of his lyrics survive, chiefly in anthologies.\n\n=237=, 95-103. =being offer'd . . . quit.= The _Duke Cassimere_ here\nspoken of was John Casimir, Count Palatine, who in the autumn of 1575\nentered into alliance with the Huguenots and invaded France, but, after\nsuffering a check at the hands of the Duke of Guise, made a truce and\nretired. The incident here spoken of apparently took place in the spring\nof the next year (cf. the previous note). Why, however, does Chapman\nintroduce it here, and how did he know of it? Can he, immediately after\nleaving Oxford, which he entered, according to Wood, \"in 1574 or\nthereabouts,\" have gone in Oxford's train to the Continent?\n\n=238=, 112. =a Sir John Smith.= Though alluded to in so contemptuous a\nway, this Sir John Smith appears to be the noted soldier of fortune,\ndiplomatist, and military writer, who lived from about 1534 to 1607.\nAfter serving for many years in continental armies, in 1574 he became an\nagent of the English government, and took part in various diplomatic\nmissions. In 1590 he published \"Certain Discourses concerning the formes\nand effects of divers sorts of Weapons\" and dedicated the work to the\nEnglish nobility, whom he calls in one part of his \"proeme\" the \"verie\neyes, eares and language of the king, and the bodie of the watch, and\nredresse of the Commonwealth.\" Hence perhaps the allusion in l. 113 to\n\"common Nobles fashions.\"\n\n=238-9=, 127-41. =If you would Consull be . . . no thought?= A\ntranslation of the _Discourses_ of Epictetus, bk.

In the Preface to the\nvolume he declares: \"Ce ne sont pas des contes de l'Antiquit\u00c3\u00a9 fabuleuse\n. . . Ce sont des histoires autant veritables que tristes et funestes.\nLes noms de la pluspart des personnages sont seulement desguisez en ce\nTh\u00c3\u00a9atre, \u00c3\u00a0 fin de n'affliger pas tant les familles de ceux qui en ont\ndonn\u00c3\u00a9 le suject, puis qu'elles en sont assez afflig\u00c3\u00a9es.\" We thus find\nthat the outlines of the story of \"Lysis\" tally with what we know about\nBussy from other sources, and Rosset not improbably preserves details\nomitted by the historians of the period.\n\nLysis, Rosset tells us, was sprung from one of the most noble and\nrenowned Houses of France. At seventeen he had acquired an extraordinary\nreputation for bravery, which increased till \"jamais la France depuis le\nvaleureux Roland, ne porta un tel Palladin.\" Afterwards \"il vint \u00c3\u00a0 la\ncour du Prince qui venoit de quiter une Couronne estrangere, pour\nrecevoir celle qui luy appartenoit par les droits de la loy Salique, [i.\ne. Henry III, who gave up the throne of Poland on succeeding to that of\nFrance.] . . . Les rares dons dont il estoit accomply luy acquirent tant\nde part aux bonnes graces du premier Prince du sang Royal, qu'il estoit\ntousiours aupres de luy. . . . Mais l'envie . . . tous les jours . . .\nfaisait de mauvais rapports a sa Maiest\u00c3\u00a9 de Lysis, de sorte qu'elle le\nvoyoit d'aussi mauvais oeil, que l'autre Prince, son proche parent,\nfaisoit conte de sa prou\u00c3\u00absse.\"\n\nHe had never been the victim of love, but he was instantly captivated by\nthe beautiful eyes of a lady whom he met at an assembly at the house of\na Judge in one of the towns of which he was Governor.\n\n\"Ceste beaut\u00c3\u00a9, pour le respect que je dois \u00c3\u00a0 ceux a qui elle\nappartenoit, sera nomm\u00c3\u00a9e Sylvie. . . . Cette dame . . . estoit mari\u00c3\u00a9e\navec un grand Seigneur, jeune, vaillan, sage, discret et courtois.\" She\nwould not at first gratify her lover's passion, though she granted him\n\"de petites privautez,\" which only fanned the flame. He wrote her a\nletter in which he declared that if she refused him her favour, it meant\nhis sentence of death. She replied in a temporising manner that when he\nhad given proofs of his fidelity, she would decide as to what she ought\nto do. Rosset asserts that these two letters are not invented, but that\nhe obtained them from a friend who had made a collection of such\nepistles, and who \"a est\u00c3\u00a9 curieux de s\u00c3\u00a7avoir le nom des personnes qui\nles ont escrites.\"\n\nMeanwhile, he continues, \"elle donne le vray moyen \u00c3\u00a0 Lysis de la voir,\nsans le souciet qu'on en parle, pourveu que sa conscience la deffende.\nEt particulierement ce fut en un jardin qui est \u00c3\u00a0 l'un des fauxbourgs de\nla ville.\" Some tale-bearers, putting the worst construction on their\nbehaviour, gave information to Lisandre, the husband of Sylvie, but he\nrefused to credit anything to the dishonour of his wife. To stop gossip,\nhowever, he took her with him to a house he had not far from the town.\nBut the lovers communicated with one another by messengers, till\nLisandre's departure on a journey removed all obstacle to their\nintercourse. \"Ce Seigneur avait des affaires hors de la province o\u00c3\u00b9 il\nfaisoit pour lors sa demeure. Pour les terminer, il s'y achemine au\ngrand contentement de Sylvie, qui neantmoins contrefaisoit la dolente \u00c3\u00a0\nson depart & le sommoit de revenir le plustot qu'il luy seroit possible,\ntandis que dans son ame elle prioit \u00c3\u00a0 Dieu que son voyage fust aussi\nlong que celuy d'Ulysse.\" When he was gone, she immediately sent for\nLysis, and they spent two or three days in transports of delight, though\nshe continued to safeguard her honour.\n\nOn Lisandre's return the King, instigated by the enemies of Lysis,\nreproached the former for tamely enduring dishonour, and bade him never\nreappear in the royal presence till he had wiped out the stain. Lisandre\ntherefore offered his wife the choice of three courses. She was to\nswallow poison, or die beneath his dagger, or write to Lysis, telling\nhim that Lisandre was still absent, and begging him to come to her.\nAfter a struggle Sylvie wrote the fatal missive, and Lysis, though at\nthe castle gate he was overcome by a premonition of evil and almost\nturned back, was obedient to her summons, and entered her chamber\nunarmed. The final scene is thus described.\n\n\"A l'instant il se void environn\u00c3\u00a9 d'une douzaine d'hommes armez, qui de\npistolets, qui d'espees nues, et qui de hallebardes. Lisandre est parmy\neux, qui luy crie: 'C'est maintenant que tu recevras le salaire de la\nhonte que tu as faicte \u00c3\u00a0 ma maison. Ce disant, il lasche un pistolet, et\nluy perce un bras. Les autres le chargent avec leurs halebardes, et avec\nleurs espees. . . . Le valeureux Lysis . . . avec un escabeau qu'il\ntient en main donne si rudement sur la teste de l'un de ses adversaires,\nqu'il en fait sortir la cervelle. Il en assomme encores deux autres:\nmais que peut-il faire contre tant de gens, & ainsi desarm\u00c3\u00a9 qu'il est?\nSon corps perc\u00c3\u00a9 comme un crible, verse un grand ruisseau de sang. En fin\nil se jette sur Lisandre, et bien que par derriere on luy baille cent\ncoups de poignards, il le prend, et le souleve, prest \u00c3\u00a0 le jetter du\nhaut en bas d'une fenestre, si tous les autres ensemble, en se jettant\nsur luy, ne l'en eussent empesch\u00c3\u00a9. Il les escarte encores \u00c3\u00a0 coups de\npoings & neantmoins il sesent tousiours percer de part en part. Voyant\nqu'il ne pouvoit eschapper la mort, il s'approche de la fenestre & puis,\ntout sanglant qu'il est, il saute legerement en bas. Mais, \u00c3\u00b4 malheur, il\nportoit un accoustrement decoupp\u00c3\u00a9, qui est arrest\u00c3\u00a9 par le fer d'un\ntreillis. Ses adversaires le voyant ainsi empestr\u00c3\u00a9 comme un autre\nAbsalon, luy donnent tant de coups de halebardes, qu'\u00c3\u00a0 la fin, ils\nprivent le monde du plus grand courage, et de la plus grande valeur du\nsiecle. O valeureux Lysis! que je plains l'injustice de ton sort!\"\n\nIt will be seen that Rosset's account of the final episodes, beginning\nwith the intervention of the King, agrees, in the main details, with the\nfollowing description by De Thou, which appeared in 1620, in the Genevan\nedition of the _Historiae Sui Temporis_, lib. LXVIII, p. 330 (vol. III,\np. 675, of Buckley's edition, 1733).\n\n\"Dum[310:1] adhuc Andinus in aula esset, literas per jocum regi\nostenderat a Ludovico Claramontio Ambosiano Bussio ad se scriptas;\nquibus, pro summa quae ei cum hero suo juvene erat familiaritate,\nsignificabat se feram magni venatoris (ita uxorem vocabat Caroli Cambii\nMonsorelli comitis, quem ea dignitate Andinus paulo ante Bussii\ncommendatione ornaverat) indagine cinxisse, et in plagas conjecisse.\nQuas literas rex retinuerat, et Bussii jam a longo tempore insolenti\narrogantia et petulantia irritatus, occasionem inde sumpsit veteres ab\neo acceptas injurias ulciscendi. Is siquidem, et dum in aula esset,\nnullo non contumeliae genere in proceres et gynaeceum etiam aulicum usus\nfuerat, fiducia pugnacitatis qua se terribilem cunctis reddiderat; sed\netiam postquam se ad comitatum Andini receperat, dum Andegavi arcem toto\nillo tractu munitissimam et urbi populosae impositam teneret, oppidanis\net toti provinciae gravis ob crebras exactiones, quas privata\nauctoritate, non consulto plerumque Andino ipso, faciebat, summum omnium\nodium in se concitaverat. Igitur rex Monsorellum, qui tunc forte in aula\nerat, clam revocat, et literas Bussii ei ostendit; additque se decoris\nfamiliae et ejus dignitatis perquam studiosum, noluisse rem adeo\ninjuriosam eum celare; ceterum scire ipsum debere, quid consilii in tali\noccasione se capere deceat et oporteat. Nec plura elocutus hominem\ndimittit, qui, non solum injuriae tantae morsu perculsus, sed monitis\nregis incitatus, quae ille tanquam ignaviae exprobationem si injuriam\nferret accipiebat, protinus domum revolat, summo silentio, ut Bussium\nlateret: astuque per uxorem ad Bussium literas dari curat, quibus ei\nhoram ad secretum Coustanteriae condicebat; ea erat arx voluptuaria et\nvenationibus opportuna; ad quam cum Bussius cum Colladone conscio sub\nvesperam XIV Kal. Sept. venisset, ab ipso Monsorello et aliis loricatis\noppressus: tamen, qua erat animi praesentia, quamvis unus contra plures,\nsumma vi percussores initio disjecit; tandemque numero victus, spiritu\ninter certandum deficiente, cum se in fossam per fenestram praecipitare\nvellet, a tergo interfectus est.\"\n\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[310:1] While the Duke of Anjou was still at Court, he had shown in jest\nto the King, a letter which had been written to him by Louis de Clermont\nBussy d'Ambois. In this letter, owing to the very intimate terms on\nwhich he stood with his young patron, he told him that he had enclosed\nand caught in his net the hind of a mighty hunter. Thus he termed the\nwife of Charles de Chambes, Count of Montsoreau, on whom the Duke had\nconferred that title a short time before, at the recommendation of\nBussy. This letter the King had kept, and as he had long been annoyed by\nBussy's insolent arrogance and his petulant temper, he availed himself\nof this opportunity of avenging the old insults he had received from\nhim. Even while he was at Court, he had been guilty of every sort of\ninsult to nobles and Court ladies, trusting to his prowess as a\nswordsman, by which he made himself a terror to every one. So also after\nhe had betaken himself to the district of Anjou, occupying, as he did,\nthe citadel of Angers, the most powerful stronghold in all that\ndistrict, and commanding the populous city, he had made himself a burden\nto the townspeople and the whole province by his frequent exactions,\ngenerally made on his own authority, without consulting the Duke of\nAnjou. He had thus stirred up against himself a deep-seated and\nuniversal hatred.\n\nTherefore the King secretly called aside Montsoreau, who was then at\nCourt, and showed him Bussy's letter, and added that, as he was\nextremely solicitous about his family honour and his dignity, he did not\nwish to conceal so insulting a matter from him; for the rest he ought to\nknow himself what measures it behoved him to take under such\ncircumstances. Without further words he dismissed Montsoreau. The Count,\nstung to the quick by so grave an injury to his honour, and excited by\nthe admonitions of the King, which he interpreted as reproaches for his\ncowardice, should he tamely bear the insult, at once flew home, in the\ngreatest secrecy, so that Bussy should not know of his return. By a\nstratagem he arranged that a letter should be sent by his wife to Bussy,\nmaking a secret assignation with him at La Coutanci\u00c3\u00a8re, which was a\npleasure-resort and convenient for hunting purposes. When Bussy came\nthere with his associate Colasseau at nightfall on the nineteenth of\nAugust, he was fallen upon by Montsoreau and other armed men. Yet, such\nwas his coolness, that though he was one against many, he at first by\nmighty exertions discomfited his assailants. At length, overcome by\nnumbers, and breath failing him in the struggle, he tried to throw\nhimself out of the window into the castle-moat, but was stabbed in the\nback and killed.\n\n\n\n\nAPPENDIX B\n\nHISTORICAL SOURCES OF THE REVENGE OF BUSSY D'AMBOIS\n\n\nI\n\nPIERRE MATTHIEU'S NARRATIVE OF THE ARREST OF THE COUNT D'AUVERGNE,\nINCORPORATED BY EDWARD GRIMESTON IN HIS TRANSLATION OF JEAN DE SERRES'S\nINVENTAIRE G\u00c3\u0089N\u00c3\u0089RAL DE L'HISTOIRE DE FRANCE\n\n(1046.)[313:1] \"The King offended with the practises of the Count of\nAuvergne, commanded him to come unto him, and to trust unto his\nclemency, the which was not unknowne unto him. Descures made some\njorneys unto him, from whome he brought nothing but delaies and excuses.\n. . .\n\n(1047.) \"The King, therefore, seeing that he would not come but with\nconditions that did not agree with a perfect obedience, resolved to have\nhim by one means or other. . . . The King's intention was imparted to\nthe Vicont of Pont du Chasteau, to D'Eurre, Lieutenant of the Duke of\nVandosmes company, to the Baron of Camilac, to La Boulaye, Lieutenant to\nthe company of the Marquis of Verneuil, to Nerestan, Colonell of a\nRegiment of foote, and to so many others as it is a wonder it was not\ndivulged being in so many heads. In this action all shewed the duties\nand affections of good men which respected their honours. Many means\nwere attempted but they were incountred with great difficulties and\ncrosses. . . . The surest meanes (& that wherein there was least trouble\nand scandall) was the mustring of the Duke of Vandosmes company. . . .\nD'Eurre who prest Murat (Treasorer extraordinary of the warres) to paie\nhis company a muster, intreated the count of Auvergne to see it, to the\nende hee might assure the King that hee had gallant men and good horses,\nand that all his companions should be wonderfully honored with the\npresence of their coronell. 'I will part to morrowe' sayd the Count of\nAuvergne 'to hunt at Alezou, and will returne againe on Monday at night;\nI pray you bee heere at super, and lodge your company at Normain, to the\nende that the next day, after that wee have dronke, runne at the ring,\nand dined, we may see it.'\n\n(1048.) \"This was done as he had appointed. . . . D'Eurre came to\nClermont on Monday at night, and goes unto him where he supped in one of\ntheir houses that managed this businesse. . . . The next day, the ninth\nof November, the morning was spent in running at the ring. . . . They\nwent to dinner, and it was well observed that the Count of Auvergne had\nsome distrust. He hath since confest that hee was ready to call the two\nbrothers of Murat into his cabinet, and to cause them to be searcht, for\nthat he was well advertised that they alwayes carryed the Kings letters\nand his commandments. But a great resolution, thinking that there is no\nmore harme in fearing then in the thing that causeth feare, feares\nextremely to make shewe that hee hath any feare. After dinner D'Eurre\nasked, 'If it pleased him to go to horse to see the musters.' He\nanswered him; 'That it should be presently, and that he should use\nspeed.' He retyred himselfe soone after into his cabinet and went downe\n. . . mounted upon a Scottish horse (which Vitry had given him) the\nwhich would have outrunne all the horses of France. He would not attend\nthe other noblemen for that he distrusted them, having an intent to\npasse on, if he found them not ready. But beeing come to the place, he\nfound the company in battell. This great diligence made him somewhat\njealous, and they might perceive him, that, pulling up his cloake, he\ndrewe his sword foure fingers out, yet without any amazement. D'Eurre,\nseeing him make even the reynes of his horse, came to him trotting, with\nhis hat in his hand, and hearing him sweare with a great oath that he\nhad been very dilligent, 'You may see, my lord' (answered he) 'I have\ncaused my companions to advance, for that I would not trouble you with\nattendance.' 'Monsieur D'Eurre' (replyed the Earle) 'you are one of my\nfriends, I cannot make any long stay here.' To whome D'Eurre said: 'All\nmy companions are not yet here, but, if it please you, you shall see\nthis troupe, and judge of the whole by a part.' Hereupon he sees some\nhorsemen come and demands what they were. D'Eurre told him: 'That it was\nNerestan, who had beene at Rion about a sute of his daughters.' He\nbeleeved it, for he knewe that Nerestan had stayd some dayes at Rion and\nyet his heart began to suspect more. But it was too late, hee was\nenvironed on every side, and hardly can one resist many. Nerestan\nlighted to salute him, and having entertayned him with some discourse\nuppon the occasion of his staye at Rion, or of his returne to Court, he\nwent presently to horse-back, and thrust on one of the lackquaies with\nhis foote, for a signe and token of the beginning of the execution.\n\n\"One of Nerestans three lackquaies takes holde of his horse by the\nbridle. D'Eurre, seeing that Nerestan had taken the right side to salute\nthe Count of Auvergne, went unto the left, and laying hold with his hand\nuppon the hilt of his sword, he sayd unto him that hee had commandement\nfrom the King to take him. The other two laquais pulled him so roughly\nfrom his horse, as he had like to have fallen to the ground; hee was\nmooved to see himselfe so intreated by laquais, intreating D'Eurre to\ncause two of his companions to light, and that hee might not see those\nrascalls any more. Nerestan sayd unto him that they were soldiars so\nattyred to serve the King in this action. A peece shott into the ayre by\nchance made him to doubt worse measure, so as hee intreated D'Eurre that\nhe would not use his pistolet. D'Eurre freed him from these\napprehensions, intreating him to resolve upon the Kings will, and not to\nforce them to intreat him otherwise than they desired. 'Well,' said hee,\n'I yeeld, what will you have mee to doe?' 'That you mount upon the\ntrompets horse,' sayd D'Eurre. It was feared that he would not have\nsuffered himselfe to bee taken so easily nor so quietly, as wee have\nseene many great courages choose rather to be cut in peeces then to see\nthemselves reserved for some shamefull end, and others that have\nwillingly dyed, for that they would not die by force. When as he sees\nhimselfe in the toyles invironed on al sides . . . hee sayd, 'Ah! in the\nDivels name, I doubted all this.' Being mounted upon the trompets nagg,\nthey conduct him presently to Aigueperse. Before hee had gone a hundred\npaces, he intreated D'Eurre to lend him one of his troupe, to carry some\nmessage of his remembrance, and of his miserie, to a ladie that attended\nhim. De Pleche had the charge. Shee who had not prepared her heart to\nwithstand the assaults of a most extreame and sensible griefe, tooke\nD'Eurre for the object, against whome shee poured forth the furie of her\npassions. 'If I knew' (sayd shee unto this gentleman) 'that I might save\nhim in forcing through your troupe, I would willingly doe it, and if I\nhad but tenne men of my courage and resolution, you should not carrie\nhim where you thinke. But I will never die till I have given D'Eurre a\nhundred shott with a pistoll, and to Murat a hundred blowes with a\nsword.' These were the passions of her love, transported with a\nresolution beyond her sexe, and which did participate of a man, of a\ntroubled mind, and of love. This last makes miracles of marvells and\nmarvells of miracles, in wills that are equally toucht with his\ninspirations. . . . Shee loved him well, and was well beloved: for the\nCount of Auvergne hath been heard say, that if the King did set him at\nlibertie, and send him back to his house, uppon condition that hee\nshould not see this ladie, hee would rather desire to die. Shee\npresently ordered the affaires of her house, the disposition of her\nfurniture, and the retreat of her servants. This passion going from the\nmemorie to the thought, from the thought to the heart, from the heart to\nthe eyes, made her to powre forth so many teares, as shee lost the sight\nof one eye for a tyme. . . .\n\n\"All the way hee seemed no more afflicted, then when hee was at\nlibertie. He tould youthfull and idle tales of his love, and the\ndeceiving of ladies. Hee shott in a harquebuse at birds, wherein hee was\nso perfect and excellent, as hee did kill larkes as they were flying. .\n. .\n\n(1050.) \"We may observe in this apprehension many things that may breed\nadmiration and amazement, and which shewe that men do in vaine furnish\nthemselves with wisedome against Heaven and with intelligences against\nthe King. The Count of Auvergne had advertisements from all places that\nthey should take him, and that the Kings pensioners were in the field to\nthat effect. His most inward and neerest friends and, among others\nFlorac, knewe it, and said nothing unto him, preferring his duty to his\nPrince before all affection. The Constable was also as well informed\nthereof as any other and yet he made no shewe thereof. . . . His duty\nprescribed him a law to all the bounds of nature; so there is not any\none but is more bound to the service of the King and his country then\nto his owne health, or to that of his children. A gentleman, being at\nhis table, speaking of this taking, said, 'Sir, if the King should\ncommand mee to take you, I would doe it, although I bee your most humble\nservant, that you march in the first rankes of greatnesse in the realm,\nand that all things touching armes, depend upon your commandments.' 'I\nbeleeve it' (answered the Constable) 'else you should do ill, for the\nKing is both your King and mine. I am your friend.' There is no love nor\naffection to dispence any one from the Kings commandments.\"\n\n\nII\n\nGRIMESTON'S TRANSLATION OF J.

The King had the two and twentith day\nfollowing prepared seven of his five and fortie (they were gentlemen\nwhome hee had appointed to be neere his person, besides the ordinarie\narchers of his gard) to execute his will, and by many dispatches had\nassured those townes which hee held to bee most mutinous. The three and\ntwentith he assembles his Councell somewhat more early in the morning\nthen was usuall, having a devotion to go after dinner, and to spend the\nholidayes at our Ladie of Clery. . . . The Duke of Guise comes, and\nattending the beginning of the councell sends for a handkercher: (the\ngroome of [724] his chamber had forgotten to put one into his hose.)\nPericart, his secretarie, not daring to commit this new advertisement to\nany mans report, ties a note to one of the corners thereof, saying,\n'Come forth and save your selfe, else you are but a dead man.' But they\nstay the page that carried it. Larchant, captaine of the Kings gard,\ncauseth an other to be given unto him with all speed by Saint Prix, the\nchiefe grome of the Kings chamber. The Castle gates are shutt, and the\nCouncell sits about eight of the clocke.\n\n\"The spirit of man doth often prophecie of the mischeefe that doth\npursue him. So whilest they dispute of a matter propounded by\nPetremolle, the Duke feeles strange alterations, and extraordinary\ndistemperatures, and, amidest his distrust, a great fainting of his\nheart. Saint Prix presents unto him some prunes of Brignolles and\nraisins of the sunne. Hee eats, and thereupon the King calls him into\nhis Cabinet by Revoll, one of the secretaries of his Estate, as it were\nto confer with him about some secret of importance. The Duke leaves the\nCouncell to passe unto the Cabinet: and as he did lift up the tapistrie\nwith one hand to enter, they charge him with their swords, daggers, and\npertuisans: yet not with so great violence, but he shewed the murtherers\nthe last endeavours of an invincible valour and courage.\n\n\"Thus lived and thus died Henry of Lorraine, Duke of Guise: a Prince\nworthie to be in the first rankes of Princes, goodly, great, tall of\nproportion, amiable of countenance, great of courage, readie in the\nexecution of his enterprises, popular, dissembling, but covering the\nsecrets of his minde with his outward behaviour, imbracing all times and\noccasions, politike in stratagems, making much of his souldiars, and\nhonouring his captaines. But a Prince who hath blemished the greatest\nbeautie of his practises by extreame ambition; factious, a great\nbragger, vaine in beleeving of soothsayers who assured him of his\ngreatnes, and of the change of his familie into a royaltie, proud, not\nable to submit his hopes, even to those from whome hee should hope for\nhis advancement, giving men to understand by his inclination, that he\nwas not borne to obey, but to commaund, and with this dessein, he framed\nthe minds of the French, by his first actions, to beleeve that he had\npartes fit to make a strange alteration in a realme.\"\n\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[313:1] The numbers refer to the pages of Grimeston's volume.\n\n\n\n\nBibliography\n\n_The place of publication is London unless otherwise indicated._\n\n\nI.

LXVIII, p. 330 ff.) the narrative of Bussy's murder, in printed\nAppendix A, and (lib. CXIII, p. 558) of Ren\u00c3\u00a9e D'Ambois's meditated\nrevenge (cf. Introduction, p. xxxvi).

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1330,"split":"test"}
