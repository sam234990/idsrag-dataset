{"ori_id":"824064fb9cee19809e9965768967fb741ea535ee","title":"Framley Parsonage","context":"Framley Parsonage\n The hero of Framley Parsonage, Mark Robarts, is a young vicar, settled in the village of Framley in Barsetshire with his wife and children. The living has come into his hands through Lady Lufton, the mother of his childhood friend Ludovic, Lord Lufton. Mark has ambitions to further his career and begins to seek connections in the county's high society. He is soon preyed upon by local Whig Member of Parliament Mr Sowerby to guarantee a substantial loan, which Mark in a moment of weakness agrees to do, even though he does not have the means and knows Sowerby to be a notorious debtor. The consequences of this blunder play a major role in the plot, with Mark eventually being publicly humiliated when bailiffs arrive and begin to take an inventory of the Robarts' furniture. At the last moment, Lord Lufton forces a loan on the reluctant Mark.\nAnother plot line deals with the romance between Mark's sister Lucy and Lord Lufton. The couple are deeply in love and the young man proposes, but Lady Lufton is against the marriage. She would prefer that her son instead choose the coldly beautiful Griselda Grantly, daughter of Archdeacon Grantly, and fears that Lucy is too \"insignificant\" for such a high position. Lucy herself recognises the great gulf between their social positions and declines the proposal. When Lord Lufton persists, she agrees only on condition that Lady Lufton ask her to accept her son. Lucy's conduct and charity (especially towards the family of poor priest Josiah Crawley) weaken her ladyship's resolve. In addition, Griselda becomes engaged to Lord Dumbello. But it is the determination of Lord Lufton that in the end vanquishes his doting mother.\nThe book ends with Lucy and Ludovic's marriage as well as three other marriages. Two of these involve the daughters of Bishop Proudie and Archdeacon Grantly. The rivalry between Mrs Proudie and Mrs Grantly over their matrimonial ambitions forms a significant comic subplot, with the latter triumphant. The other marriage is that of the outspoken heiress, Martha Dunstable, to Doctor Thorne, the eponymous hero of the preceding novel in the series.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, Framley Parsonage, by Anthony Trollope,\nIllustrated by John Everett Millais\n\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

He was a gentleman\npossessed of no private means, but enjoying a lucrative practice,\nwhich had enabled him to maintain and educate a family with all the\nadvantages which money can give in this country. Mark was his eldest\nson and second child; and the first page or two of this narrative\nmust be consumed in giving a catalogue of the good things which\nchance and conduct together had heaped upon this young man's head.\n\nHis first step forward in life had arisen from his having been\nsent, while still very young, as a private pupil to the house of a\nclergyman, who was an old friend and intimate friend of his father's.\nThis clergyman had one other, and only one other, pupil--the young\nLord Lufton; and between the two boys, there had sprung up a close\nalliance.\n\nWhile they were both so placed, Lady Lufton had visited her son,\nand then invited young Robarts to pass his next holidays at Framley\nCourt. This visit was made; and it ended in Mark going back to Exeter\nwith a letter full of praise from the widowed peeress. She had been\ndelighted, she said, in having such a companion for her son, and\nexpressed a hope that the boys might remain together during the\ncourse of their education. Dr. Robarts was a man who thought much of\nthe breath of peers and peeresses, and was by no means inclined to\nthrow away any advantage which might arise to his child from such a\nfriendship. When, therefore, the young lord was sent to Harrow, Mark\nRobarts went there also.\n\nThat the lord and his friend often quarrelled, and occasionally\nfought,--the fact even that for one period of three months they never\nspoke to each other--by no means interfered with the doctor's hopes.\nMark again and again stayed a fortnight at Framley Court, and Lady\nLufton always wrote about him in the highest terms.\n\nAnd then the lads went together to Oxford, and here Mark's good\nfortune followed him, consisting rather in the highly respectable\nmanner in which he lived, than in any wonderful career of collegiate\nsuccess. His family was proud of him, and the doctor was always ready\nto talk of him to his patients; not because he was a prizeman, and\nhad gotten medals and scholarships, but on account of the excellence\nof his general conduct. He lived with the best set--he incurred no\ndebts--he was fond of society, but able to avoid low society--liked\nhis glass of wine, but was never known to be drunk; and, above all\nthings, was one of the most popular men in the university.\n\nThen came the question of a profession for this young Hyperion,\nand on this subject, Dr. Robarts was invited himself to go over to\nFramley Court to discuss the matter with Lady Lufton. Dr. Robarts\nreturned with a very strong conception that the Church was the\nprofession best suited to his son.\n\nLady Lufton had not sent for Dr. Robarts all the way from Exeter for\nnothing. The living of Framley was in the gift of the Lufton family,\nand the next presentation would be in Lady Lufton's hands, if it\nshould fall vacant before the young lord was twenty-five years of\nage, and in the young lord's hands if it should fall afterwards. But\nthe mother and the heir consented to give a joint promise to Dr.\nRobarts. Now, as the present incumbent was over seventy, and as the\nliving was worth \u00c2\u00a3900 a year, there could be no doubt as to the\neligibility of the clerical profession.\n\nAnd I must further say, that the dowager and the doctor were\njustified in their choice by the life and principles of the young\nman--as far as any father can be justified in choosing such a\nprofession for his son, and as far as any lay impropriator can be\njustified in making such a promise. Had Lady Lufton had a second son,\nthat second son would probably have had the living, and no one would\nhave thought it wrong;--certainly not if that second son had been\nsuch a one as Mark Robarts.\n\nLady Lufton herself was a woman who thought much on religious\nmatters, and would by no means have been disposed to place any one in\na living, merely because such a one had been her son's friend. Her\ntendencies were High Church, and she was enabled to perceive that\nthose of young Mark Robarts ran in the same direction. She was very\ndesirous that her son should make an associate of his clergyman, and\nby this step she would insure, at any rate, that. She was anxious\nthat the parish vicar should be one with whom she could herself fully\nco-operate, and was perhaps unconsciously wishful that he might in\nsome measure be subject to her influence. Should she appoint an elder\nman, this might probably not be the case to the same extent; and\nshould her son have the gift, it might probably not be the case at\nall. And therefore it was resolved that the living should be given to\nyoung Robarts.\n\nHe took his degree--not with any brilliancy, but quite in the manner\nthat his father desired; he then travelled for eight or ten months\nwith Lord Lufton and a college don, and almost immediately after his\nreturn home was ordained.\n\nThe living of Framley is in the diocese of Barchester; and, seeing\nwhat were Mark's hopes with reference to that diocese, it was by no\nmeans difficult to get him a curacy within it. But this curacy he was\nnot allowed long to fill. He had not been in it above a twelvemonth,\nwhen poor old Dr. Stopford, the then vicar of Framley, was gathered\nto his fathers, and the full fruition of his rich hopes fell upon his\nshoulders.\n\nBut even yet more must be told of his good fortune before we can come\nto the actual incidents of our story. Lady Lufton, who, as I have\nsaid, thought much of clerical matters, did not carry her High Church\nprinciples so far as to advocate celibacy for the clergy. On the\ncontrary, she had an idea that a man could not be a good parish\nparson without a wife. So, having given to her favourite a position\nin the world, and an income sufficient for a gentleman's wants, she\nset herself to work to find him a partner in those blessings.\n\nAnd here also, as in other matters, he fell in with the views of\nhis patroness--not, however, that they were declared to him in that\nmarked manner in which the affair of the living had been broached.\nLady Lufton was much too highly gifted with woman's craft for that.\nShe never told the young vicar that Miss Monsell accompanied her\nladyship's married daughter to Framley Court expressly that he, Mark,\nmight fall in love with her; but such was in truth the case.\n\nLady Lufton had but two children. The eldest, a daughter, had been\nmarried some four or five years to Sir George Meredith, and this\nMiss Monsell was a dear friend of hers. And now looms before me the\nnovelist's great difficulty. Miss Monsell,--or, rather, Mrs. Mark\nRobarts,--must be described. As Miss Monsell, our tale will have\nto take no prolonged note of her. And yet we will call her Fanny\nMonsell, when we declare that she was one of the pleasantest\ncompanions that could be brought near to a man, as the future partner\nof his home, and owner of his heart. And if high principles without\nasperity, female gentleness without weakness, a love of laughter\nwithout malice, and a true loving heart, can qualify a woman to be a\nparson's wife, then was Fanny Monsell qualified to fill that station.\n\nIn person she was somewhat larger than common. Her face would have\nbeen beautiful but that her mouth was large. Her hair, which was\ncopious, was of a bright brown; her eyes also were brown, and, being\nso, were the distinctive feature of her face, for brown eyes are not\ncommon. They were liquid, large, and full either of tenderness or of\nmirth. Mark Robarts still had his accustomed luck, when such a girl\nas this was brought to Framley for his wooing.\n\nAnd he did woo her--and won her. For Mark himself was a handsome\nfellow. At this time the vicar was about twenty-five years of age,\nand the future Mrs. Robarts was two or three years younger. Nor did\nshe come quite empty-handed to the vicarage. It cannot be said that\nFanny Monsell was an heiress, but she had been left with a provision\nof some few thousand pounds. This was so settled, that the interest\nof his wife's money paid the heavy insurance on his life which\nyoung Robarts effected, and there was left to him, over and above,\nsufficient to furnish his parsonage in the very best style of\nclerical comfort,--and to start him on the road of life rejoicing.\n\nSo much did Lady Lufton do for her _prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9_, and it may well be\nimagined that the Devonshire physician, sitting meditative over his\nparlour fire, looking back, as men will look back on the upshot of\ntheir life, was well contented with that upshot, as regarded his\neldest offshoot, the Rev. Mark Robarts, the vicar of Framley.\n\nBut little has as yet been said, personally, as to our hero himself,\nand perhaps it may not be necessary to say much. Let us hope that by\ndegrees he may come forth upon the canvas, showing to the beholder\nthe nature of the man inwardly and outwardly. Here it may suffice\nto say that he was no born heaven's cherub, neither was he a born\nfallen devil's spirit. Such as his training made him, such he was.\nHe had large capabilities for good--and aptitudes also for evil,\nquite enough: quite enough to make it needful that he should repel\ntemptation as temptation only can be repelled. Much had been done to\nspoil him, but in the ordinary acceptation of the word he was not\nspoiled. He had too much tact, too much common sense, to believe\nhimself to be the paragon which his mother thought him. Self-conceit\nwas not, perhaps, his greatest danger. Had he possessed more of it,\nhe might have been a less agreeable man, but his course before him\nmight on that account have been the safer.\n\nIn person he was manly, tall, and fair-haired, with a square\nforehead, denoting intelligence rather than thought, with clear white\nhands, filbert nails, and a power of dressing himself in such a\nmanner that no one should ever observe of him that his clothes were\neither good or bad, shabby or smart.\n\nSuch was Mark Robarts when at the age of twenty-five, or a little\nmore, he married Fanny Monsell. The marriage was celebrated in his\nown church, for Miss Monsell had no home of her own, and had been\nstaying for the last three months at Framley Court. She was given\naway by Sir George Meredith, and Lady Lufton herself saw that the\nwedding was what it should be, with almost as much care as she had\nbestowed on that of her own daughter. The deed of marrying, the\nabsolute tying of the knot, was performed by the Very Reverend the\nDean of Barchester, an esteemed friend of Lady Lufton's. And Mrs.\nArabin, the dean's wife, was of the party, though the distance from\nBarchester to Framley is long, and the roads deep, and no railway\nlends its assistance. And Lord Lufton was there of course; and people\nprotested that he would surely fall in love with one of the four\nbeautiful bridesmaids, of whom Blanche Robarts, the vicar's second\nsister, was by common acknowledgment by far the most beautiful.\n\nAnd there was there another and a younger sister of Mark's--who did\nnot officiate at the ceremony, though she was present--and of whom no\nprediction was made, seeing that she was then only sixteen, but of\nwhom mention is made here, as it will come to pass that my readers\nwill know her hereafter. Her name was Lucy Robarts.\n\nAnd then the vicar and his wife went off on their wedding tour, the\nold curate taking care of the Framley souls the while.\n\nAnd in due time they returned; and after a further interval, in due\ncourse, a child was born to them; and then another; and after that\ncame the period at which we will begin our story. But before doing\nso, may I not assert that all men were right in saying all manner of\ngood things to the Devonshire physician, and in praising his luck in\nhaving such a son?\n\n\"You were up at the house to-day, I suppose?\" said Mark to his wife,\nas he sat stretching himself in an easy chair in the drawing-room,\nbefore the fire, previously to his dressing for dinner. It was a\nNovember evening, and he had been out all day, and on such occasions\nthe aptitude for delay in dressing is very powerful. A strong-minded\nman goes direct from the hall-door to his chamber without\nencountering the temptation of the drawing-room fire.\n\n\"No; but Lady Lufton was down here.\"\n\n\"Full of arguments in favour of Sarah Thompson?\"\n\n\"Exactly so, Mark.\"\n\n\"And what did you say about Sarah Thompson?\"\n\n\"Very little as coming from myself; but I did hint that you thought,\nor that I thought that you thought, that one of the regular trained\nschoolmistresses would be better.\"\n\n\"But her ladyship did not agree?\"\n\n\"Well, I won't exactly say that;--though I think that perhaps she did\nnot.\"\n\n\"I am sure she did not. When she has a point to carry, she is very\nfond of carrying it.\"\n\n\"But then, Mark, her points are generally so good.\"\n\n\"But, you see, in this affair of the school she is thinking more of\nher _prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9e_ than she does of the children.\"\n\n\"Tell her that, and I am sure she will give way.\"\n\nAnd then again they were both silent. And the vicar having thoroughly\nwarmed himself, as far as this might be done by facing the fire,\nturned round and began the operation _\u00c3\u00a0 tergo_.\n\n\"Come, Mark, it is twenty minutes past six. Will you go and dress?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what, Fanny: she must have her way about Sarah\nThompson. You can see her to-morrow and tell her so.\"\n\n\"I am sure, Mark, I would not give way, if I thought it wrong. Nor\nwould she expect it.\"\n\n\"If I persist this time, I shall certainly have to yield the next;\nand then the next may probably be more important.\"\n\n\"But if it's wrong, Mark?\"\n\n\"I didn't say it was wrong. Besides, if it is wrong, wrong in some\ninfinitesimal degree, one must put up with it. Sarah Thompson is very\nrespectable; the only question is whether she can teach.\"\n\nThe young wife, though she did not say so, had some idea that her\nhusband was in error. It is true that one must put up with wrong,\nwith a great deal of wrong. But no one need put up with wrong that\nhe can remedy. Why should he, the vicar, consent to receive an\nincompetent teacher for the parish children, when he was able to\nprocure one that was competent? In such a case,--so thought Mrs.\nRobarts to herself,--she would have fought the matter out with Lady\nLufton.\n\nOn the next morning, however, she did as she was bid, and signified\nto the dowager that all objection to Sarah Thompson would be\nwithdrawn.\n\n\"Ah! I was sure he would agree with me,\" said her ladyship, \"when\nhe learned what sort of person she is. I know I had only to\nexplain;\"--and then she plumed her feathers, and was very gracious;\nfor, to tell the truth, Lady Lufton did not like to be opposed in\nthings which concerned the parish nearly.\n\n\"And, Fanny,\" said Lady Lufton, in her kindest manner, \"you are not\ngoing anywhere on Saturday, are you?\"\n\n\"No, I think not.\"\n\n\"Then you must come to us. Justinia is to be here, you know\"--Lady\nMeredith was named Justinia--\"and you and Mr. Robarts had better stay\nwith us till Monday. He can have the little book-room all to himself\non Sunday. The Merediths go on Monday; and Justinia won't be happy if\nyou are not with her.\"\n\nIt would be unjust to say that Lady Lufton had determined not to\ninvite the Robartses if she were not allowed to have her own way\nabout Sarah Thompson. But such would have been the result. As it\nwas, however, she was all kindness; and when Mrs. Robarts made some\nlittle excuse, saying that she was afraid she must return home in the\nevening, because of the children, Lady Lufton declared that there was\nroom enough at Framley Court for baby and nurse, and so settled the\nmatter in her own way, with a couple of nods and three taps of her\numbrella.\n\nThis was on a Tuesday morning, and on the same evening, before\ndinner, the vicar again seated himself in the same chair before the\ndrawing-room fire, as soon as he had seen his horse led into the\nstable.\n\n\"Mark,\" said his wife, \"the Merediths are to be at Framley on\nSaturday and Sunday; and I have promised that we will go up and stay\nover till Monday.\"\n\n\"You don't mean it! Goodness gracious, how provoking!\"\n\n\"Why? I thought you wouldn't mind it. And Justinia would think it\nunkind if I were not there.\"\n\n\"You can go, my dear, and of course will go. But as for me, it is\nimpossible.\"\n\n\"But why, love?\"\n\n\"Why? Just now, at the school-house, I answered a letter that was\nbrought to me from Chaldicotes. Sowerby insists on my going over\nthere for a week or so; and I have said that I would.\"\n\n\"Go to Chaldicotes for a week, Mark?\"\n\n\"I believe I have even consented to ten days.\"\n\n\"And be away two Sundays?\"\n\n\"No, Fanny, only one. Don't be so censorious.\"\n\n\"Don't call me censorious, Mark; you know I am not so. But I am so\nsorry. It is just what Lady Lufton won't like. Besides, you were away\nin Scotland two Sundays last month.\"\n\n\"In September, Fanny. And that is being censorious.\"\n\n\"Oh, but, Mark, dear Mark; don't say so. You know I don't mean it.\nBut Lady Lufton does not like those Chaldicotes people. You know Lord\nLufton was with you the last time you were there; and how annoyed she\nwas!\"\n\n\"Lord Lufton won't be with me now, for he is still in Scotland. And\nthe reason why I am going is this: Harold Smith and his wife will be\nthere, and I am very anxious to know more of them. I have no doubt\nthat Harold Smith will be in the government some day, and I cannot\nafford to neglect such a man's acquaintance.\"\n\n\"But, Mark, what do you want of any government?\"\n\n\"Well, Fanny, of course I am bound to say that I want nothing;\nneither in one sense do I; but nevertheless, I shall go and meet the\nHarold Smiths.\"\n\n\"Could you not be back before Sunday?\"\n\n\"I have promised to preach at Chaldicotes. Harold Smith is going to\nlecture at Barchester, about the Australasian archipelago, and I am\nto preach a charity sermon on the same subject. They want to send out\nmore missionaries.\"\n\n\"A charity sermon at Chaldicotes!\"\n\n\"And why not? The house will be quite full, you know; and I dare say\nthe Arabins will be there.\"\n\n\"I think not; Mrs. Arabin may get on with Mrs. Harold Smith, though\nI doubt that; but I'm sure she's not fond of Mrs. Smith's brother.\nI don't think she would stay at Chaldicotes.\"\n\n\"And the bishop will probably be there for a day or two.\"\n\n\"That is much more likely, Mark. If the pleasure of meeting Mrs.\nProudie is taking you to Chaldicotes, I have not a word more to say.\"\n\n\"I am not a bit more fond of Mrs. Proudie than you are, Fanny,\" said\nthe vicar, with something like vexation in the tone of his voice,\nfor he thought that his wife was hard upon him. \"But it is generally\nthought that a parish clergyman does well to meet his bishop now and\nthen. And as I was invited there, especially to preach while all\nthese people are staying at the place, I could not well refuse.\"\nAnd then he got up, and taking his candlestick, escaped to his\ndressing-room.\n\n\"But what am I to say to Lady Lufton?\" his wife said to him, in the\ncourse of the evening.\n\n\"Just write her a note, and tell her that you find I had promised to\npreach at Chaldicotes next Sunday. You'll go, of course?\"\n\n\"Yes: but I know she'll be annoyed. You were away the last time she\nhad people there.\"\n\n\"It can't be helped. She must put it down against Sarah Thompson. She\nought not to expect to win always.\"\n\n\"I should not have minded it, if she had lost, as you call it, about\nSarah Thompson. That was a case in which you ought to have had your\nown way.\"\n\n\"And this other is a case in which I shall have it. It's a pity that\nthere should be such a difference; isn't it?\"\n\nThen the wife perceived that, vexed as she was, it would be better\nthat she should say nothing further; and before she went to bed, she\nwrote the note to Lady Lufton, as her husband recommended.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nTHE FRAMLEY SET, AND THE CHALDICOTES SET.\n\n\nIt will be necessary that I should say a word or two of some of the\npeople named in the few preceding pages, and also of the localities\nin which they lived.\n\nOf Lady Lufton herself enough, perhaps, has been written to introduce\nher to my readers. The Framley property belonged to her son; but\nas Lufton Park--an ancient ramshackle place in another county--had\nheretofore been the family residence of the Lufton family, Framley\nCourt had been apportioned to her for her residence for life. Lord\nLufton himself was still unmarried; and as he had no establishment\nat Lufton Park--which indeed had not been inhabited since his\ngrandfather died--he lived with his mother when it suited him to\nlive anywhere in that neighbourhood. The widow would fain have seen\nmore of him than he allowed her to do. He had a shooting-lodge\nin Scotland, and apartments in London, and a string of horses in\nLeicestershire--much to the disgust of the county gentry around him,\nwho held that their own hunting was as good as any that England could\nafford. His lordship, however, paid his subscription to the East\nBarsetshire pack, and then thought himself at liberty to follow his\nown pleasure as to his own amusement.\n\nFramley itself was a pleasant country place, having about it nothing\nof seignorial dignity or grandeur, but possessing everything\nnecessary for the comfort of country life. The house was a low\nbuilding of two stories, built at different periods, and devoid of\nall pretensions to any style of architecture; but the rooms, though\nnot lofty, were warm and comfortable, and the gardens were trim and\nneat beyond all others in the county. Indeed, it was for its gardens\nonly that Framley Court was celebrated.\n\nVillage there was none, properly speaking. The high road went winding\nabout through the Framley paddocks, shrubberies, and wood-skirted\nhome fields, for a mile and a half, not two hundred yards of which\nran in a straight line; and there was a cross-road which passed\ndown through the domain, whereby there came to be a locality called\nFramley Cross. Here stood the \"Lufton Arms,\" and here, at Framley\nCross, the hounds occasionally would meet; for the Framley woods were\ndrawn in spite of the young lord's truant disposition; and then, at\nthe Cross also, lived the shoemaker, who kept the post-office.\n\nFramley church was distant from this just a quarter of a mile, and\nstood immediately opposite to the chief entrance to Framley Court. It\nwas but a mean, ugly building, having been erected about a hundred\nyears since, when all churches then built were made to be mean and\nugly; nor was it large enough for the congregation, some of whom were\nthus driven to the dissenting chapels, the Sions and Ebenezers, which\nhad got themselves established on each side of the parish, in putting\ndown which Lady Lufton thought that her pet parson was hardly as\nenergetic as he might be. It was, therefore, a matter near to Lady\nLufton's heart to see a new church built, and she was urgent in her\neloquence, both with her son and with the vicar, to have this good\nwork commenced.\n\nBeyond the church, but close to it, were the boys' school and girls'\nschool, two distinct buildings, which owed their erection to Lady\nLufton's energy; then came a neat little grocer's shop, the neat\ngrocer being the clerk and sexton, and the neat grocer's wife, the\npew-opener in the church. Podgens was their name, and they were great\nfavourites with her ladyship, both having been servants up at the\nhouse.\n\nAnd here the road took a sudden turn to the left, turning, as it\nwere, away from Framley Court; and just beyond the turn was the\nvicarage, so that there was a little garden path running from the\nback of the vicarage grounds into the churchyard, cutting the\nPodgenses off into an isolated corner of their own;--from whence, to\ntell the truth, the vicar would have been glad to banish them and\ntheir cabbages, could he have had the power to do so. For has not\nthe small vineyard of Naboth been always an eyesore to neighbouring\npotentates?\n\nThe potentate in this case had as little excuse as Ahab, for nothing\nin the parsonage way could be more perfect than his parsonage. It\nhad all the details requisite for the house of a moderate gentleman\nwith moderate means, and none of those expensive superfluities which\nimmoderate gentlemen demand, or which themselves demand--immoderate\nmeans. And then the gardens and paddocks were exactly suited to it;\nand everything was in good order;--not exactly new, so as to be raw\nand uncovered, and redolent of workmen; but just at that era of their\nexistence in which newness gives way to comfortable homeliness.\n\nOther village at Framley there was none. At the back of the Court, up\none of those cross-roads, there was another small shop or two, and\nthere was a very neat cottage residence, in which lived the widow of\na former curate, another _prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9_ of Lady Lufton's; and there was a\nbig, staring brick house, in which the present curate lived; but this\nwas a full mile distant from the church, and farther from Framley\nCourt, standing on that cross-road which runs from Framley Cross in a\ndirection away from the mansion. This gentleman, the Rev. Evan Jones,\nmight, from his age, have been the vicar's father; but he had been\nfor many years curate of Framley; and though he was personally\ndisliked by Lady Lufton, as being Low Church in his principles, and\nunsightly in his appearance, nevertheless, she would not urge his\nremoval. He had two or three pupils in that large brick house, and\nif turned out from these and from his curacy, might find it difficult\nto establish himself elsewhere. On this account mercy was extended\nto the Rev. E. Jones, and, in spite of his red face and awkward\nbig feet, he was invited to dine at Framley Court, with his plain\ndaughter, once in every three months.\n\nOver and above these, there was hardly a house in the parish of\nFramley, outside the bounds of Framley Court, except those of farmers\nand farm labourers; and yet the parish was of large extent.\n\nFramley is in the eastern division of the county of Barsetshire,\nwhich, as all the world knows, is, politically speaking, as true\nblue a county as any in England. There have been backslidings even\nhere, it is true; but then, in what county have there not been such\nbackslidings? Where, in these pinchbeck days, can we hope to find\nthe old agricultural virtue in all its purity? But, among those\nbacksliders, I regret to say, that men now reckon Lord Lufton. Not\nthat he is a violent Whig, or perhaps that he is a Whig at all.\nBut he jeers and sneers at the old county doings; declares, when\nsolicited on the subject, that, as far as he is concerned, Mr. Bright\nmay sit for the county, if he pleases; and alleges, that being\nunfortunately a peer, he has no right even to interest himself in\nthe question. All this is deeply regretted, for, in the old days,\nthere was no portion of the county more decidedly true blue than that\nFramley district; and, indeed, up to the present day, the dowager is\nable to give an occasional helping hand.\n\nChaldicotes is the seat of Nathaniel Sowerby, Esq., who, at the\nmoment supposed to be now present, is one of the members for the\nWestern Division of Barsetshire. But this Western Division can boast\nnone of the fine political attributes which grace its twin brother.\nIt is decidedly Whig, and is almost governed in its politics by one\nor two great Whig families.\n\nIt has been said that Mark Robarts was about to pay a visit to\nChaldicotes, and it has been hinted that his wife would have been as\nwell pleased had this not been the case. Such was certainly the fact;\nfor she, dear, prudent, excellent wife as she was, knew that Mr.\nSowerby was not the most eligible friend in the world for a young\nclergyman, and knew, also, that there was but one other house in the\nwhole county the name of which was so distasteful to Lady Lufton.\nThe reasons for this were, I may say, manifold. In the first place,\nMr. Sowerby was a Whig, and was seated in Parliament mainly by the\ninterest of that great Whig autocrat the Duke of Omnium, whose\nresidence was more dangerous even than that of Mr. Sowerby, and whom\nLady Lufton regarded as an impersonation of Lucifer upon earth. Mr.\nSowerby, too, was unmarried--as indeed, also, was Lord Lufton, much\nto his mother's grief. Mr. Sowerby, it is true, was fifty, whereas\nthe young lord was as yet only twenty-six, but, nevertheless, her\nladyship was becoming anxious on the subject. In her mind, every\nman was bound to marry as soon as he could maintain a wife; and she\nheld an idea--a quite private tenet, of which she was herself but\nimperfectly conscious--that men in general were inclined to neglect\nthis duty for their own selfish gratifications, that the wicked ones\nencouraged the more innocent in this neglect, and that many would\nnot marry at all, were not an unseen coercion exercised against them\nby the other sex. The Duke of Omnium was the very head of all such\nsinners, and Lady Lufton greatly feared that her son might be made\nsubject to the baneful Omnium influence, by means of Mr. Sowerby and\nChaldicotes.\n\nAnd then Mr. Sowerby was known to be a very poor man, with a very\nlarge estate. He had wasted, men said, much on electioneering, and\nmore in gambling. A considerable portion of his property had already\ngone into the hands of the duke, who, as a rule, bought up everything\naround him that was to be purchased. Indeed it was said of him by his\nenemies, that so covetous was he of Barsetshire property, that he\nwould lead a young neighbour on to his ruin, in order that he might\nget his land. What--oh! what if he should come to be possessed in\nthis way of any of the fair acres of Framley Court? What if he should\nbecome possessed of them all? It can hardly be wondered at that Lady\nLufton should not like Chaldicotes.\n\nThe Chaldicotes set, as Lady Lufton called them, were in every way\nopposed to what a set should be according to her ideas. She liked\ncheerful, quiet, well-to-do people, who loved their Church, their\ncountry, and their Queen, and who were not too anxious to make a\nnoise in the world. She desired that all the farmers round her should\nbe able to pay their rents without trouble, that all the old women\nshould have warm flannel petticoats, that the working men should\nbe saved from rheumatism by healthy food and dry houses, that they\nshould all be obedient to their pastors and masters--temporal as well\nas spiritual. That was her idea of loving her country. She desired\nalso that the copses should be full of pheasants, the stubble-field\nof partridges, and the gorse covers of foxes;--in that way, also, she\nloved her country. She had ardently longed, during that Crimean war,\nthat the Russians might be beaten--but not by the French, to the\nexclusion of the English, as had seemed to her to be too much the\ncase; and hardly by the English under the dictatorship of Lord\nPalmerston. Indeed, she had had but little faith in that war after\nLord Aberdeen had been expelled. If, indeed, Lord Derby could have\ncome in!\n\nBut now as to this Chaldicotes set. After all, there was nothing\nso very dangerous about them; for it was in London, not in the\ncountry, that Mr. Sowerby indulged, if he did indulge, his bachelor\nmal-practices. Speaking of them as a set, the chief offender was\nMr. Harold Smith, or perhaps his wife. He also was a member of\nParliament, and, as many thought, a rising man. His father had been\nfor many years a debater in the House, and had held high office.\nHarold, in early life, had intended himself for the cabinet; and if\nworking hard at his trade could ensure success, he ought to obtain\nit sooner or later. He had already filled more than one subordinate\nstation, had been at the Treasury, and for a month or two at the\nAdmiralty, astonishing official mankind by his diligence. Those\nlast-named few months had been under Lord Aberdeen, with whom he had\nbeen forced to retire. He was a younger son, and not possessed of any\nlarge fortune. Politics as a profession was therefore of importance\nto him. He had in early life married a sister of Mr. Sowerby; and\nas the lady was some six or seven years older than himself, and had\nbrought with her but a scanty dowry, people thought that in this\nmatter Mr. Harold Smith had not been perspicacious. Mr. Harold Smith\nwas not personally a popular man with any party, though some judged\nhim to be eminently useful. He was laborious, well-informed, and, on\nthe whole, honest; but he was conceited, long-winded, and pompous.\n\nMrs. Harold Smith was the very opposite of her lord. She was a\nclever, bright woman, good-looking for her time of life--and she was\nnow over forty--with a keen sense of the value of all worldly things,\nand a keen relish for all the world's pleasures. She was neither\nlaborious, nor well-informed, nor perhaps altogether honest--what\nwoman ever understood the necessity or recognized the advantage of\npolitical honesty?--but then she was neither dull nor pompous, and\nif she was conceited, she did not show it. She was a disappointed\nwoman, as regards her husband; seeing that she had married him on the\nspeculation that he would at once become politically important; and\nas yet Mr. Smith had not quite fulfilled the prophecies of his early\nlife.\n\nAnd Lady Lufton, when she spoke of the Chaldicotes set, distinctly\nincluded, in her own mind, the Bishop of Barchester, and his wife\nand daughter. Seeing that Bishop Proudie was, of course, a man much\naddicted to religion and to religious thinking, and that Mr. Sowerby\nhimself had no peculiar religious sentiments whatever, there would\nnot at first sight appear to be ground for much intercourse, and\nperhaps there was not much of such intercourse; but Mrs. Proudie\nand Mrs. Harold Smith were firm friends of four or five years'\nstanding--ever since the Proudies came into the diocese; and\ntherefore the bishop was usually taken to Chaldicotes whenever Mrs.\nSmith paid her brother a visit. Now Bishop Proudie was by no means\na High Church dignitary, and Lady Lufton had never forgiven him for\ncoming into that diocese. She had, instinctively, a high respect\nfor the episcopal office; but of Bishop Proudie himself she hardly\nthought better than she did of Mr. Sowerby, or of that fabricator of\nevil, the Duke of Omnium. Whenever Mr. Robarts would plead that in\ngoing anywhere he would have the benefit of meeting the bishop, Lady\nLufton would slightly curl her upper lip. She could not say in words,\nthat Bishop Proudie--bishop as he certainly must be called--was no\nbetter than he ought to be; but by that curl of her lip she did\nexplain to those who knew her that such was the inner feeling of her\nheart.\n\nAnd then it was understood--Mark Robarts, at least, had so heard,\nand the information soon reached Framley Court--that Mr. Supplehouse\nwas to make one of the Chaldicotes party. Now Mr. Supplehouse was a\nworse companion for a gentlemanlike, young, High Church, conservative\ncounty parson than even Harold Smith. He also was in Parliament, and\nhad been extolled during the early days of that Russian war by some\nportion of the metropolitan daily press, as the only man who could\nsave the country. Let him be in the ministry, the _Jupiter_ had said,\nand there would be some hope of reform, some chance that England's\nancient glory would not be allowed in these perilous times to go\nheadlong to oblivion. And upon this the ministry, not anticipating\nmuch salvation from Mr. Supplehouse, but willing, as they usually\nare, to have the _Jupiter_ at their back, did send for that\ngentleman, and gave him some footing among them. But how can a man\nborn to save a nation, and to lead a people, be content to fill the\nchair of an under-secretary? Supplehouse was not content, and soon\ngave it to be understood that his place was much higher than any\nyet tendered to him. The seals of high office, or war to the knife,\nwas the alternative which he offered to a much-belaboured Head of\nAffairs--nothing doubting that the Head of Affairs would recognize\nthe claimant's value, and would have before his eyes a wholesome fear\nof the _Jupiter_. But the Head of Affairs, much belaboured as he was,\nknew that he might pay too high even for Mr. Supplehouse and the\n_Jupiter_; and the saviour of the nation was told that he might swing\nhis tomahawk. Since that time he had been swinging his tomahawk, but\nnot with so much effect as had been anticipated. He also was very\nintimate with Mr. Sowerby, and was decidedly one of the Chaldicotes\nset.\n\nAnd there were many others included in the stigma whose sins were\npolitical or religious rather than moral. But they were gall and\nwormwood to Lady Lufton, who regarded them as children of the Lost\nOne, and who grieved with a mother's grief when she knew that her son\nwas among them, and felt all a patron's anger when she heard that her\nclerical _prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9_ was about to seek such society. Mrs. Robarts might\nwell say that Lady Lufton would be annoyed.\n\n\"You won't call at the house before you go, will you?\" the wife asked\non the following morning. He was to start after lunch on that day,\ndriving himself in his own gig, so as to reach Chaldicotes, some\ntwenty-four miles distant, before dinner.\n\n\"No, I think not. What good should I do?\"\n\n\"Well, I can't explain; but I think I should call: partly, perhaps,\nto show her that as I had determined to go, I was not afraid of\ntelling her so.\"\n\n\"Afraid! That's nonsense, Fanny. I'm not afraid of her. But I don't\nsee why I should bring down upon myself the disagreeable things she\nwill say. Besides, I have not time. I must walk up and see Jones\nabout the duties; and then, what with getting ready, I shall have\nenough to do to get off in time.\"\n\nHe paid his visit to Mr. Jones, the curate, feeling no qualms\nof conscience there, as he rather boasted of all the members of\nParliament he was going to meet, and of the bishop who would be with\nthem. Mr. Evan Jones was only his curate, and in speaking to him on\nthe matter he could talk as though it were quite the proper thing for\na vicar to meet his bishop at the house of a county member. And one\nwould be inclined to say that it was proper: only why could he not\ntalk of it in the same tone to Lady Lufton? And then, having kissed\nhis wife and children, he drove off, well pleased with his prospect\nfor the coming ten days, but already anticipating some discomfort on\nhis return.\n\nOn the three following days, Mrs. Robarts did not meet her ladyship.\nShe did not exactly take any steps to avoid such a meeting, but she\ndid not purposely go up to the big house. She went to her school as\nusual, and made one or two calls among the farmers' wives, but put\nno foot within the Framley Court grounds. She was braver than her\nhusband, but even she did not wish to anticipate the evil day.\n\nOn the Saturday, just before it began to get dusk, when she was\nthinking of preparing for the fatal plunge, her friend, Lady\nMeredith, came to her.\n\n\"So, Fanny, we shall again be so unfortunate as to miss Mr. Robarts,\"\nsaid her ladyship.\n\n\"Yes. Did you ever know anything so unlucky? But he had promised Mr.\nSowerby before he heard that you were coming. Pray do not think that\nhe would have gone away had he known it.\"\n\n\"We should have been sorry to keep him from so much more amusing a\nparty.\"\n\n\"Now, Justinia, you are unfair. You intend to imply that he has gone\nto Chaldicotes, because he likes it better than Framley Court; but\nthat is not the case. I hope Lady Lufton does not think that it is.\"\n\nLady Meredith laughed as she put her arm round her friend's waist.\n\"Don't lose your eloquence in defending him to me,\" she said. \"You'll\nwant all that for my mother.\"\n\n\"But is your mother angry?\" asked Mrs. Robarts, showing by her\ncountenance, how eager she was for true tidings on the subject.\n\n\"Well, Fanny, you know her ladyship as well as I do. She thinks so\nvery highly of the vicar of Framley, that she does begrudge him to\nthose politicians at Chaldicotes.\"\n\n\"But, Justinia, the bishop is to be there, you know.\"\n\n\"I don't think that that consideration will at all reconcile my\nmother to the gentleman's absence. He ought to be very proud, I know,\nto find that he is so much thought of. But come, Fanny, I want you to\nwalk back with me, and you can dress at the house. And now we'll go\nand look at the children.\"\n\nAfter that, as they walked together to Framley Court, Mrs. Robarts\nmade her friend promise that she would stand by her if any serious\nattack were made on the absent clergyman.\n\n\"Are you going up to your room at once?\" said the vicar's wife,\nas soon as they were inside the porch leading into the hall. Lady\nMeredith immediately knew what her friend meant, and decided that the\nevil day should not be postponed. \"We had better go in and have it\nover,\" she said, \"and then we shall be comfortable for the evening.\"\nSo the drawing-room door was opened, and there was Lady Lufton alone\nupon the sofa.\n\n\"Now, mamma,\" said the daughter, \"you mustn't scold Fanny much about\nMr. Robarts. He has gone to preach a charity sermon before the\nbishop, and under those circumstances, perhaps, he could not refuse.\"\nThis was a stretch on the part of Lady Meredith--put in with much\ngood nature, no doubt; but still a stretch; for no one had supposed\nthat the bishop would remain at Chaldicotes for the Sunday.\n\n\"How do you do, Fanny?\" said Lady Lufton, getting up. \"I am not\ngoing to scold her; and I don't know how you can talk such nonsense,\nJustinia. Of course, we are very sorry not to have Mr. Robarts; more\nespecially as he was not here the last Sunday that Sir George was\nwith us. I do like to see Mr. Robarts in his own church, certainly;\nand I don't like any other clergyman there as well. If Fanny takes\nthat for scolding, why--\"\n\n\"Oh! no, Lady Lufton; and it's so kind of you to say so. But Mr.\nRobarts was so sorry that he had accepted this invitation to\nChaldicotes, before he heard that Sir George was coming, and--\"\n\n\"Oh, I know that Chaldicotes has great attractions which we cannot\noffer,\" said Lady Lufton.\n\n\"Indeed, it was not that. But he was asked to preach, you know; and\nMr. Harold Smith--\" Poor Fanny was only making it worse. Had she been\nworldly wise, she would have accepted the little compliment implied\nin Lady Lufton's first rebuke, and then have held her peace.\n\n\"Oh, yes; the Harold Smiths! They are irresistible, I know. How could\nany man refuse to join a party, graced both by Mrs. Harold Smith and\nMrs. Proudie--even though his duty should require him to stay away?\"\n\n\"Now, mamma--\" said Justinia.\n\n\"Well, my dear, what am I to say? You would not wish me to tell a\nfib. I don't like Mrs. Harold Smith--at least, what I hear of her;\nfor it has not been my fortune to meet her since her marriage. It\nmay be conceited; but to own the truth, I think that Mr. Robarts\nwould be better off with us at Framley than with the Harold Smiths at\nChaldicotes,--even though Mrs. Proudie be thrown into the bargain.\"\n\nIt was nearly dark, and therefore the rising colour in the face of\nMrs. Robarts could not be seen. She, however, was too good a wife to\nhear these things said without some anger within her bosom. She could\nblame her husband in her own mind; but it was intolerable to her that\nothers should blame him in her hearing.\n\n\"He would undoubtedly be better off,\" she said; \"but then, Lady\nLufton, people can't always go exactly where they will be best off.\nGentlemen sometimes must--\"\n\n\"Well--well, my dear, that will do. He has not taken you, at any\nrate; and so we will forgive him.\" And Lady Lufton kissed her. \"As it\nis,\"--and she affected a low whisper between the two young wives--\"as\nit is, we must e'en put up with poor old Evan Jones. He is to be here\nto-night, and we must go and dress to receive him.\"\n\nAnd so they went off. Lady Lufton was quite good enough at heart to\nlike Mrs. Robarts all the better for standing up for her absent lord.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nCHALDICOTES.\n\n\nChaldicotes is a house of much more pretension than Framley Court.\nIndeed, if one looks at the ancient marks about it, rather than\nat those of the present day, it is a place of very considerable\npretension. There is an old forest, not altogether belonging to the\nproperty, but attached to it, called the Chace of Chaldicotes. A\nportion of this forest comes up close behind the mansion, and of\nitself gives a character and celebrity to the place. The Chace of\nChaldicotes--the greater part of it, at least--is, as all the world\nknows, Crown property, and now, in these utilitarian days, is to be\ndisforested. In former times it was a great forest, stretching half\nacross the country, almost as far as Silverbridge; and there are bits\nof it, here and there, still to be seen at intervals throughout the\nwhole distance; but the larger remaining portion, consisting of aged\nhollow oaks, centuries old, and wide-spreading withered beeches,\nstands in the two parishes of Chaldicotes and Uffley. People still\ncome from afar to see the oaks of Chaldicotes, and to hear their feet\nrustle among the thick autumn leaves. But they will soon come no\nlonger. The giants of past ages are to give way to wheat and turnips;\na ruthless Chancellor of the Exchequer, disregarding old associations\nand rural beauty, requires money returns from the lands; and the\nChace of Chaldicotes is to vanish from the earth's surface.\n\nSome part of it, however, is the private property of Mr. Sowerby,\nwho hitherto, through all his pecuniary distresses, has managed to\nsave from the axe and the auction-mart that portion of his paternal\nheritage. The house of Chaldicotes is a large stone building,\nprobably of the time of Charles the Second. It is approached on both\nfronts by a heavy double flight of stone steps. In the front of\nthe house a long, solemn, straight avenue through a double row of\nlime-trees, leads away to lodge-gates, which stand in the centre of\nthe village of Chaldicotes; but to the rear the windows open upon\nfour different vistas, which run down through the forest: four open\ngreen rides, which all converge together at a large iron gateway,\nthe barrier which divides the private grounds from the Chace. The\nSowerbys, for many generations, have been rangers of the Chace of\nChaldicotes, thus having almost as wide an authority over the Crown\nforest as over their own. But now all this is to cease, for the\nforest will be disforested.\n\nIt was nearly dark as Mark Robarts drove up through the avenue of\nlime-trees to the hall-door; but it was easy to see that the house,\nwhich was dead and silent as the grave through nine months of the\nyear, was now alive in all its parts. There were lights in many\nof the windows, and a noise of voices came from the stables, and\nservants were moving about, and dogs barked, and the dark gravel\nbefore the front steps was cut up with many a coach-wheel.\n\n\"Oh, be that you, sir, Mr. Robarts?\" said a groom, taking the\nparson's horse by the head, and touching his own hat. \"I hope I see\nyour reverence well?\"\n\n\"Quite well, Bob, thank you. All well at Chaldicotes?\"\n\n\"Pretty bobbish, Mr. Robarts. Deal of life going on here now, sir.\nThe bishop and his lady came this morning.\"\n\n\"Oh--ah--yes! I understood they were to be here. Any of the young\nladies?\"\n\n\"One young lady. Miss Olivia, I think they call her, your reverence.\"\n\n\"And how's Mr. Sowerby?\"\n\n\"Very well, your reverence. He, and Mr. Harold Smith, and Mr.\nFothergill--that's the duke's man of business, you know--is getting\noff their horses now in the stable-yard there.\"\n\n\"Home from hunting--eh, Bob?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, just home, this minute.\" And then Mr. Robarts walked into\nthe house, his portmanteau following on a footboy's shoulder.\n\nIt will be seen that our young vicar was very intimate at\nChaldicotes; so much so that the groom knew him, and talked to him\nabout the people in the house. Yes; he was intimate there: much more\nthan he had given the Framley people to understand. Not that he had\nwilfully and overtly deceived any one; not that he had ever spoken a\nfalse word about Chaldicotes. But he had never boasted at home that\nhe and Sowerby were near allies. Neither had he told them there\nhow often Mr. Sowerby and Lord Lufton were together in London. Why\ntrouble women with such matters? Why annoy so excellent a woman as\nLady Lufton?\n\nAnd then Mr. Sowerby was one whose intimacy few young men would\nwish to reject. He was fifty, and had lived, perhaps, not the most\nsalutary life; but he dressed young, and usually looked well. He was\nbald, with a good forehead, and sparkling moist eyes. He was a clever\nman, and a pleasant companion, and always good-humoured when it\nso suited him. He was a gentleman, too, of high breeding and good\nbirth, whose ancestors had been known in that county--longer, the\nfarmers around would boast, than those of any other landowner in it,\nunless it be the Thornes of Ullathorne, or perhaps the Greshams of\nGreshamsbury--much longer than the De Courcys at Courcy Castle. As\nfor the Duke of Omnium, he, comparatively speaking, was a new man.\n\nAnd then he was a member of Parliament, a friend of some men in\npower, and of others who might be there; a man who could talk about\nthe world as one knowing the matter of which he talked. And moreover,\nwhatever might be his ways of life at other times, when in the\npresence of a clergyman he rarely made himself offensive to clerical\ntastes. He neither swore, nor brought his vices on the carpet, nor\nsneered at the faith of the Church. If he was no churchman himself,\nhe at least knew how to live with those who were.\n\nHow was it possible that such a one as our vicar should not relish\nthe intimacy of Mr. Sowerby? It might be very well, he would say to\nhimself, for a woman like Lady Lufton to turn up her nose at him--for\nLady Lufton, who spent ten months of the year at Framley Court, and\nwho during those ten months, and for the matter of that, during the\ntwo months also which she spent in London, saw no one out of her own\nset. Women did not understand such things, the vicar said to himself;\neven his own wife--good, and nice, and sensible, and intelligent as\nshe was--even she did not understand that a man in the world must\nmeet all sorts of men; and that in these days it did not do for a\nclergyman to be a hermit.\n\n'Twas thus that Mark Robarts argued when he found himself called upon\nto defend himself before the bar of his own conscience for going to\nChaldicotes and increasing his intimacy with Mr. Sowerby. He did know\nthat Mr. Sowerby was a dangerous man; he was aware that he was over\nhead and ears in debt, and that he had already entangled young Lord\nLufton in some pecuniary embarrassment; his conscience did tell him\nthat it would be well for him, as one of Christ's soldiers, to look\nout for companions of a different stamp. But nevertheless he went\nto Chaldicotes, not satisfied with himself indeed, but repeating to\nhimself a great many arguments why he should be so satisfied.\n\nHe was shown into the drawing-room at once, and there he found Mrs.\nHarold Smith, with Mrs. and Miss Proudie, and a lady whom he had\nnever before seen, and whose name he did not at first hear mentioned.\n\n\"Is that Mr. Robarts?\" said Mrs. Harold Smith, getting up to greet\nhim, and screening her pretended ignorance under the veil of the\ndarkness. \"And have you really driven over four-and-twenty miles of\nBarsetshire roads on such a day as this to assist us in our little\ndifficulties? Well, we can promise you gratitude at any rate.\"\n\nAnd then the vicar shook hands with Mrs. Proudie, in that deferential\nmanner which is due from a vicar to his bishop's wife; and Mrs.\nProudie returned the greeting with all that smiling condescension\nwhich a bishop's wife should show to a vicar. Miss Proudie was not\nquite so civil. Had Mr. Robarts been still unmarried, she also could\nhave smiled sweetly; but she had been exercising smiles on clergymen\ntoo long to waste them now on a married parish parson.\n\n\"And what are the difficulties, Mrs. Smith, in which I am to assist\nyou?\"\n\n\"We have six or seven gentlemen here, Mr. Robarts, and they always go\nout hunting before breakfast, and they never come back--I was going\nto say--till after dinner. I wish it were so, for then we should not\nhave to wait for them.\"\n\n\"Excepting Mr. Supplehouse, you know,\" said the unknown lady, in a\nloud voice.\n\n\"And he is generally shut up in the library, writing articles.\"\n\n\"He'd be better employed if he were trying to break his neck like the\nothers,\" said the unknown lady.\n\n\"Only he would never succeed,\" said Mrs. Harold Smith. \"But perhaps,\nMr. Robarts, you are as bad as the rest; perhaps you, too, will be\nhunting to-morrow.\"\n\n\"My dear Mrs. Smith!\" said Mrs. Proudie, in a tone denoting slight\nreproach, and modified horror.\n\n\"Oh! I forgot. No, of course, you won't be hunting, Mr. Robarts;\nyou'll only be wishing that you could.\"\n\n\"Why can't he?\" said the lady with the loud voice.\n\n\"My dear Miss Dunstable! a clergyman hunt, while he is staying in the\nsame house with the bishop? Think of the proprieties!\"\n\n\"Oh--ah! The bishop wouldn't like it--wouldn't he? Now, do tell me,\nsir, what would the bishop do to you if you did hunt?\"\n\n\"It would depend upon his mood at the time, madam,\" said Mr. Robarts.\n\"If that were very stern, he might perhaps have me beheaded before\nthe palace gates.\"\n\nMrs. Proudie drew herself up in her chair, showing that she did\nnot like the tone of the conversation; and Miss Proudie fixed her\neyes vehemently on her book, showing that Miss Dunstable and her\nconversation were both beneath her notice.\n\n\"If these gentlemen do not mean to break their necks to-night,\" said\nMrs. Harold Smith, \"I wish they'd let us know it. It's half-past six\nalready.\"\n\nAnd then Mr. Robarts gave them to understand that no such catastrophe\ncould be looked for that day, as Mr. Sowerby and the other sportsmen\nwere within the stable-yard when he entered the door.\n\n\"Then, ladies, we may as well dress,\" said Mrs. Harold Smith. But\nas she moved towards the door, it opened, and a short gentleman,\nwith a slow, quiet step, entered the room; but was not yet to be\ndistinguished through the dusk by the eyes of Mr. Robarts. \"Oh!\nbishop, is that you?\" said Mrs. Smith. \"Here is one of the luminaries\nof your diocese.\" And then the bishop, feeling through the dark, made\nhis way up to the vicar and shook him cordially by the hand. \"He\nwas delighted to meet Mr. Robarts at Chaldicotes,\" he said--\"quite\ndelighted. Was he not going to preach on behalf of the Papuan Mission\nnext Sunday? Ah! so he, the bishop, had heard. It was a good work,\nan excellent work.\" And then Dr. Proudie expressed himself as much\ngrieved that he could not remain at Chaldicotes, and hear the sermon.\nIt was plain that his bishop thought no ill of him on account of his\nintimacy with Mr. Sowerby. But then he felt in his own heart that he\ndid not much regard his bishop's opinion.\n\n\"Ah, Robarts, I'm delighted to see you,\" said Mr. Sowerby, when they\nmet on the drawing-room rug before dinner. \"You know Harold Smith?\nYes, of course you do. Well, who else is there? Oh! Supplehouse. Mr.\nSupplehouse, allow me to introduce to you my friend Mr. Robarts. It\nis he who will extract the five-pound note out of your pocket next\nSunday for these poor Papuans whom we are going to Christianize.\nThat is, if Harold Smith does not finish the work out of hand at his\nSaturday lecture. And, Robarts, you have seen the bishop, of course:\"\nthis he said in a whisper. \"A fine thing to be a bishop, isn't it?\nI wish I had half your chance. But, my dear fellow, I've made such a\nmistake; I haven't got a bachelor parson for Miss Proudie. You must\nhelp me out, and take her in to dinner.\" And then the great gong\nsounded, and off they went in pairs.\n\nAt dinner Mark found himself seated between Miss Proudie and the lady\nwhom he had heard named as Miss Dunstable. Of the former he was not\nvery fond, and, in spite of his host's petition, was not inclined to\nplay bachelor parson for her benefit. With the other lady he would\nwillingly have chatted during the dinner, only that everybody else at\ntable seemed to be intent on doing the same thing. She was neither\nyoung, nor beautiful, nor peculiarly ladylike; yet she seemed\nto enjoy a popularity which must have excited the envy of Mr.\nSupplehouse, and which certainly was not altogether to the taste\nof Mrs. Proudie--who, however, f\u00c3\u00aated her as much as did the others.\nSo that our clergyman found himself unable to obtain more than an\ninconsiderable share of the lady's attention.\n\n\"Bishop,\" said she, speaking across the table, \"we have missed you so\nall day! we have had no one on earth to say a word to us.\"\n\n\"My dear Miss Dunstable, had I known that-- But I really was engaged\non business of some importance.\"\n\n\"I don't believe in business of importance; do you, Mrs. Smith?\"\n\n\"Do I not?\" said Mrs. Smith. \"If you were married to Mr. Harold Smith\nfor one week, you'd believe in it.\"\n\n\"Should I, now? What a pity that I can't have that chance of\nimproving my faith! But you are a man of business, also, Mr.\nSupplehouse; so they tell me.\" And she turned to her neighbour on her\nright hand.\n\n\"I cannot compare myself to Harold Smith,\" said he. \"But perhaps I\nmay equal the bishop.\"\n\n\"What does a man do, now, when he sits himself down to business? How\ndoes he set about it? What are his tools? A quire of blotting paper,\nI suppose, to begin with?\"\n\n\"That depends, I should say, on his trade. A shoemaker begins by\nwaxing his thread.\"\n\n\"And Mr. Harold Smith--?\"\n\n\"By counting up his yesterday's figures, generally, I should say;\nor else by unrolling a ball of red tape. Well-docketed papers and\nstatistical facts are his forte.\"\n\n\"And what does a bishop do? Can you tell me that?\"\n\n\"He sends forth to his clergy either blessings or blowings-up,\naccording to the state of his digestive organs. But Mrs. Proudie can\nexplain all that to you with the greatest accuracy.\"\n\n\"Can she, now? I understand what you mean, but I don't believe a word\nof it. The bishop manages his own affairs himself, quite as much as\nyou do, or Mr. Harold Smith.\"\n\n\"I, Miss Dunstable?\"\n\n\"Yes, you.\"\n\n\"But I, unluckily, have not a wife to manage them for me.\"\n\n\"Then you should not laugh at those who have, for you don't know what\nyou may come to yourself, when you're married.\"\n\nMr. Supplehouse began to make a pretty speech, saying that he would\nbe delighted to incur any danger in that respect to which he might\nbe subjected by the companionship of Miss Dunstable. But before he\nwas half through it, she had turned her back upon him, and begun a\nconversation with Mark Robarts.\n\n\"Have you much work in your parish, Mr. Robarts?\" she asked. Now,\nMark was not aware that she knew his name, or the fact of his having\na parish, and was rather surprised by the question. And he had not\nquite liked the tone in which she had seemed to speak of the bishop\nand his work. His desire for her further acquaintance was therefore\nsomewhat moderated, and he was not prepared to answer her question\nwith much zeal.\n\n\"All parish clergymen have plenty of work, if they choose to do it.\"\n\n\"Ah, that is it; is it not, Mr. Robarts? If they choose to do it? A\ngreat many do--many that I know, do; and see what a result they have.\nBut many neglect it--and see what a result _they_ have. I think it\nought to be the happiest life that a man can lead, that of a parish\nclergyman, with a wife and family, and a sufficient income.\"\n\n\"I think it is,\" said Mark Robarts, asking himself whether the\ncontentment accruing to him from such blessings had made him\nsatisfied at all points. He had all these things of which Miss\nDunstable spoke, and yet he had told his wife, the other day, that he\ncould not afford to neglect the acquaintance of a rising politician\nlike Harold Smith.\n\n\"What I find fault with is this,\" continued Miss Dunstable, \"that we\nexpect clergymen to do their duty, and don't give them a sufficient\nincome--give them hardly any income at all. Is it not a scandal,\nthat an educated gentleman with a family should be made to work half\nhis life, and perhaps the whole, for a pittance of seventy pounds a\nyear?\"\n\nMark said that it was a scandal, and thought of Mr. Evan Jones and\nhis daughter;--and thought also of his own worth, and his own house,\nand his own nine hundred a year.\n\n\"And yet you clergymen are so proud--aristocratic would be the\ngenteel word, I know--that you won't take the money of common,\nordinary poor people. You must be paid from land and endowments, from\ntithe and church property. You can't bring yourself to work for what\nyou earn, as lawyers and doctors do. It is better that curates should\nstarve than undergo such ignominy as that.\"\n\n\"It is a long subject, Miss Dunstable.\"\n\n\"A very long one; and that means that I am not to say any more about\nit.\"\n\n\"I did not mean that exactly.\"\n\n\"Oh! but you did though, Mr. Robarts. And I can take a hint of that\nkind when I get it. You clergymen like to keep those long subjects\nfor your sermons, when no one can answer you. Now if I have a longing\nheart's desire for anything at all in this world, it is to be able to\nget up into a pulpit, and preach a sermon.\"\n\n\"You can't conceive how soon that appetite would pall upon you, after\nits first indulgence.\"\n\n\"That would depend upon whether I could get people to listen to me.\nIt does not pall upon Mr. Spurgeon, I suppose.\" Then her attention\nwas called away by some question from Mr. Sowerby, and Mark Robarts\nfound himself bound to address his conversation to Miss Proudie.\nMiss Proudie, however, was not thankful, and gave him little but\nmonosyllables for his pains.\n\n\"Of course you know Harold Smith is going to give us a lecture about\nthese islanders,\" Mr. Sowerby said to him, as they sat round the fire\nover their wine after dinner. Mark said that he had been so informed,\nand should be delighted to be one of the listeners.\n\n\"You are bound to do that, as he is going to listen to you the day\nafterwards--or, at any rate, to pretend to do so, which is as much as\nyou will do for him. It'll be a terrible bore--the lecture, I mean,\nnot the sermon.\" And he spoke very low into his friend's ear. \"Fancy\nhaving to drive ten miles after dusk, and ten miles back, to hear\nHarold Smith talk for two hours about Borneo! One must do it, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"I daresay it will be very interesting.\"\n\n\"My dear fellow, you haven't undergone so many of these things as I\nhave. But he's right to do it. It's his line of life; and when a man\nbegins a thing he ought to go on with it. Where's Lufton all this\ntime?\"\n\n\"In Scotland, when I last heard from him; but he's probably at Melton\nnow.\"\n\n\"It's deuced shabby of him, not hunting here in his own county. He\nescapes all the bore of going to lectures, and giving feeds to the\nneighbours; that's why he treats us so. He has no idea of his duty,\nhas he?\"\n\n\"Lady Lufton does all that, you know.\"\n\n\"I wish I'd a Mrs. Sowerby _m\u00c3\u00a8re_ to do it for me. But then Lufton\nhas no constituents to look after--lucky dog! By-the-by, has he\nspoken to you about selling that outlying bit of land of his in\nOxfordshire? It belongs to the Lufton property, and yet it doesn't.\nIn my mind it gives more trouble than it's worth.\"\n\nLord Lufton had spoken to Mark about this sale, and had explained to\nhim that such a sacrifice was absolutely necessary, in consequence\nof certain pecuniary transactions between him, Lord Lufton, and Mr.\nSowerby. But it was found impracticable to complete the business\nwithout Lady Lufton's knowledge, and her son had commissioned Mr.\nRobarts not only to inform her ladyship, but to talk her over, and\nto appease her wrath. This commission he had not yet attempted to\nexecute, and it was probable that this visit to Chaldicotes would not\ndo much to facilitate the business.\n\n\"They are the most magnificent islands under the sun,\" said Harold\nSmith to the bishop.\n\n\"Are they, indeed!\" said the bishop, opening his eyes wide, and\nassuming a look of intense interest.\n\n\"And the most intelligent people.\"\n\n\"Dear me!\" said the bishop.\n\n\"All they want is guidance, encouragement, instruction--\"\n\n\"And Christianity,\" suggested the bishop.\n\n\"And Christianity, of course,\" said Mr. Smith, remembering that he\nwas speaking to a dignitary of the Church. It was well to humour such\npeople, Mr. Smith thought. But the Christianity was to be done in the\nSunday sermon, and was not part of his work.\n\n\"And how do you intend to begin with them?\" asked Mr. Supplehouse,\nthe business of whose life it had been to suggest difficulties.\n\n\"Begin with them--oh--why--it's very easy to begin with them. The\ndifficulty is to go on with them, after the money is all spent. We'll\nbegin by explaining to them the benefits of civilization.\"\n\n\"Capital plan!\" said Mr. Supplehouse. \"But how do you set about it,\nSmith?\"\n\n\"How do we set about it? How did we set about it with Australia and\nAmerica? It is very easy to criticize; but in such matters the great\nthing is to put one's shoulder to the wheel.\"\n\n\"We sent our felons to Australia,\" said Supplehouse, \"and they began\nthe work for us. And as to America, we exterminated the people\ninstead of civilizing them.\"\n\n\"We did not exterminate the inhabitants of India,\" said Harold Smith,\nangrily.\n\n\"Nor have we attempted to Christianize them, as the bishop so\nproperly wishes to do with your islanders.\"\n\n\"Supplehouse, you are not fair,\" said Mr. Sowerby, \"neither to Harold\nSmith nor to us;--you are making him rehearse his lecture, which is\nbad for him; and making us hear the rehearsal, which is bad for us.\"\n\n\"Supplehouse belongs to a clique which monopolizes the wisdom of\nEngland,\" said Harold Smith; \"or, at any rate, thinks that it\ndoes. But the worst of them is that they are given to talk leading\narticles.\"\n\n\"Better that, than talk articles which are not leading,\" said Mr.\nSupplehouse. \"Some first-class official men do that.\"\n\n\"Shall I meet you at the duke's next week, Mr. Robarts?\" said the\nbishop to him, soon after they had gone into the drawing-room.\n\nMeet him at the duke's!--the established enemy of Barsetshire\nmankind, as Lady Lufton regarded his grace! No idea of going to the\nduke's had ever entered our hero's mind; nor had he been aware that\nthe duke was about to entertain any one.\n\n\"No, my lord; I think not. Indeed, I have no acquaintance with his\ngrace.\"\n\n\"Oh--ah! I did not know. Because Mr. Sowerby is going; and so are the\nHarold Smiths, and, I think, Mr. Supplehouse. An excellent man is\nthe duke;--that is, as regards all the county interests,\" added the\nbishop, remembering that the moral character of his bachelor grace\nwas not the very best in the world.\n\nAnd then his lordship began to ask some questions about the church\naffairs of Framley, in which a little interest as to Framley Court\nwas also mixed up, when he was interrupted by a rather sharp voice,\nto which he instantly attended.\n\n\"Bishop,\" said the rather sharp voice; and the bishop trotted across\nthe room to the back of the sofa, on which his wife was sitting.\n\"Miss Dunstable thinks that she will be able to come to us for a\ncouple of days, after we leave the duke's.\"\n\n\"I shall be delighted above all things,\" said the bishop, bowing low\nto the dominant lady of the day. For be it known to all men, that\nMiss Dunstable was the great heiress of that name.\n\n\"Mrs. Proudie is so very kind as to say that she will take me in,\nwith my poodle, parrot, and pet old woman.\"\n\n\"I tell Miss Dunstable that we shall have quite room for any of her\nsuite,\" said Mrs. Proudie. \"And that it will give us no trouble.\"\n\n\"'The labour we delight in physics pain,'\" said the gallant bishop,\nbowing low, and putting his hand upon his heart.\n\nIn the meantime, Mr. Fothergill had got hold of Mark Robarts. Mr.\nFothergill was a gentleman, and a magistrate of the county, but\nhe occupied the position of managing man on the Duke of Omnium's\nestates. He was not exactly his agent; that is to say, he did not\nreceive his rents; but he \"managed\" for him, saw people, went about\nthe county, wrote letters, supported the electioneering interest,\ndid popularity when it was too much trouble for the duke to do it\nhimself, and was, in fact, invaluable. People in West Barsetshire\nwould often say that they did not know what _on earth_ the duke would\ndo, if it were not for Mr. Fothergill. Indeed, Mr. Fothergill was\nuseful to the duke.\n\n\"Mr. Robarts,\" he said, \"I am very happy to have the pleasure of\nmeeting you--very happy, indeed. I have often heard of you from our\nfriend Sowerby.\"\n\nMark bowed, and said that he was delighted to have the honour of\nmaking Mr. Fothergill's acquaintance.\n\n\"I am commissioned by the Duke of Omnium,\" continued Mr. Fothergill,\n\"to say how glad he will be if you will join his grace's party at\nGatherum Castle, next week. The bishop will be there, and indeed\nnearly the whole set who are here now. The duke would have written\nwhen he heard that you were to be at Chaldicotes; but things were\nhardly quite arranged then, so his grace has left it for me to tell\nyou how happy he will be to make your acquaintance in his own house.\nI have spoken to Sowerby,\" continued Mr. Fothergill, \"and he very\nmuch hopes that you will be able to join us.\"\n\nMark felt that his face became red when this proposition was made\nto him. The party in the county to which he properly belonged--he\nand his wife, and all that made him happy and respectable--looked\nupon the Duke of Omnium with horror and amazement; and now he had\nabsolutely received an invitation to the duke's house! A proposition\nwas made to him that he should be numbered among the duke's friends!\n\nAnd though in one sense he was sorry that the proposition was made\nto him, yet in another he was proud of it. It is not every young\nman, let his profession be what it may, who can receive overtures of\nfriendship from dukes without some elation. Mark, too, had risen in\nthe world, as far as he had yet risen, by knowing great people; and\nhe certainly had an ambition to rise higher. I will not degrade him\nby calling him a tuft-hunter; but he undoubtedly had a feeling that\nthe paths most pleasant for a clergyman's feet were those which were\ntrodden by the great ones of the earth.\n\nNevertheless, at the moment he declined the duke's invitation. He\nwas very much flattered, he said, but the duties of his parish would\nrequire him to return direct from Chaldicotes to Framley.\n\n\"You need not give me an answer to-night, you know,\" said Mr.\nFothergill. \"Before the week is past, we will talk it over with\nSowerby and the bishop. It will be a thousand pities, Mr. Robarts,\nif you will allow me to say so, that you should neglect such an\nopportunity of knowing his grace.\"\n\nWhen Mark went to bed, his mind was still set against going to the\nduke's; but, nevertheless, he did feel that it was a pity that he\nshould not do so. After all, was it necessary that he should obey\nLady Lufton in all things?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nA MATTER OF CONSCIENCE.\n\n\nIt is no doubt very wrong to long after a naughty thing. But\nnevertheless we all do so. One may say that hankering after naughty\nthings is the very essence of the evil into which we have been\nprecipitated by Adam's fall. When we confess that we are all sinners,\nwe confess that we all long after naughty things.\n\nAnd ambition is a great vice--as Mark Antony told us a long time\nago--a great vice, no doubt, if the ambition of the man be with\nreference to his own advancement, and not to the advancement of\nothers. But then, how many of us are there who are not ambitious in\nthis vicious manner?\n\nAnd there is nothing viler than the desire to know great\npeople--people of great rank, I should say; nothing worse than the\nhunting of titles and worshipping of wealth. We all know this, and\nsay it every day of our lives. But presuming that a way into the\nsociety of Park Lane was open to us, and a way also into that of\nBedford Row, how many of us are there who would prefer Bedford Row\nbecause it is so vile to worship wealth and title?\n\nI am led into these rather trite remarks by the necessity of putting\nforward some sort of excuse for that frame of mind in which the Rev.\nMark Robarts awoke on the morning after his arrival at Chaldicotes.\nAnd I trust that the fact of his being a clergyman will not be\nallowed to press against him unfairly. Clergymen are subject to\nthe same passions as other men; and, as far as I can see, give way\nto them, in one line or in another, almost as frequently. Every\nclergyman should, by canonical rule, feel a personal disinclination\nto a bishopric; but yet we do not believe that such personal\ndisinclination is generally very strong.\n\nMark's first thoughts when he woke on that morning flew back to Mr.\nFothergill's invitation. The duke had sent a special message to say\nhow peculiarly glad he, the duke, would be to make acquaintance\nwith him, the parson! How much of this message had been of Mr.\nFothergill's own manufacture, that Mark Robarts did not consider.\n\nHe had obtained a living at an age when other young clergymen are\nbeginning to think of a curacy, and he had obtained such a living as\nmiddle-aged parsons in their dreams regard as a possible Paradise for\ntheir old years. Of course he thought that all these good things had\nbeen the results of his own peculiar merits. Of course he felt that\nhe was different from other parsons,--more fitted by nature for\nintimacy with great persons, more urbane, more polished, and more\nrichly endowed with modern clerical well-to-do aptitudes. He was\ngrateful to Lady Lufton for what she had done for him; but perhaps\nnot so grateful as he should have been.\n\nAt any rate he was not Lady Lufton's servant, nor even her dependant.\nSo much he had repeated to himself on many occasions, and had gone\nso far as to hint the same idea to his wife. In his career as parish\npriest he must in most things be the judge of his own actions--and in\nmany also it was his duty to be the judge of those of his patroness.\nThe fact of Lady Lufton having placed him in the living, could by no\nmeans make her the proper judge of his actions. This he often said\nto himself; and he said as often that Lady Lufton certainly had a\nhankering after such a judgment-seat.\n\nOf whom generally did prime ministers and official bigwigs think it\nexpedient to make bishops and deans? Was it not, as a rule, of those\nclergymen who had shown themselves able to perform their clerical\nduties efficiently, and able also to take their place with ease in\nhigh society? He was very well off certainly at Framley; but he\ncould never hope for anything beyond Framley, if he allowed himself\nto regard Lady Lufton as a bugbear. Putting Lady Lufton and her\nprejudices out of the question, was there any reason why he ought not\nto accept the duke's invitation? He could not see that there was any\nsuch reason. If any one could be a better judge on such a subject\nthan himself, it must be his bishop. And it was clear that the bishop\nwished him to go to Gatherum Castle.\n\nThe matter was still left open to him. Mr. Fothergill had especially\nexplained that; and therefore his ultimate decision was as yet within\nhis own power. Such a visit would cost him some money, for he knew\nthat a man does not stay at great houses without expense; and then,\nin spite of his good income, he was not very flush of money. He had\nbeen down this year with Lord Lufton in Scotland. Perhaps it might be\nmore prudent for him to return home.\n\nBut then an idea came to him that it behoved him as a man and a\npriest to break through that Framley thraldom under which he felt\nthat he did to a certain extent exist. Was it not the fact that he\nwas about to decline this invitation from fear of Lady Lufton? and\nif so, was that a motive by which he ought to be actuated? It was\nincumbent on him to rid himself of that feeling. And in this spirit\nhe got up and dressed.\n\nThere was hunting again on that day; and as the hounds were to meet\nnear Chaldicotes, and to draw some coverts lying on the verge of the\nChace, the ladies were to go in carriages through the drives of the\nforest, and Mr. Robarts was to escort them on horseback. Indeed it\nwas one of those hunting-days got up rather for the ladies than for\nthe sport. Great nuisances they are to steady, middle-aged hunting\nmen; but the young fellows like them because they have thereby an\nopportunity of showing off their sporting finery, and of doing a\nlittle flirtation on horseback. The bishop, also, had been minded to\nbe of the party; so, at least, he had said on the previous evening;\nand a place in one of the carriages had been set apart for him: but\nsince that, he and Mrs. Proudie had discussed the matter in private,\nand at breakfast his lordship declared that he had changed his mind.\n\nMr. Sowerby was one of those men who are known to be very poor--as\npoor as debt can make a man--but who, nevertheless, enjoy all the\nluxuries which money can give. It was believed that he could not\nlive in England out of jail but for his protection as a member of\nParliament; and yet it seemed that there was no end to his horses\nand carriages, his servants and retinue. He had been at this work\nfor a great many years, and practice, they say, makes perfect. Such\ncompanions are very dangerous. There is no cholera, no yellow-fever,\nno small-pox more contagious than debt. If one lives habitually among\nembarrassed men, one catches it to a certainty. No one had injured\nthe community in this way more fatally than Mr. Sowerby. But still he\ncarried on the game himself; and now on this morning carriages and\nhorses thronged at his gate, as though he were as substantially rich\nas his friend the Duke of Omnium.\n\n\"Robarts, my dear fellow,\" said Mr. Sowerby, when they were well\nunder way down one of the glades of the forest,--for the place\nwhere the hounds met was some four or five miles from the house of\nChaldicotes,--\"ride on with me a moment. I want to speak to you; and\nif I stay behind we shall never get to the hounds.\" So Mark, who had\ncome expressly to escort the ladies, rode on alongside of Mr. Sowerby\nin his pink coat.\n\n\"My dear fellow, Fothergill tells me that you have some hesitation\nabout going to Gatherum Castle.\"\n\n\"Well, I did decline, certainly. You know I am not a man of pleasure,\nas you are. I have some duties to attend to.\"\n\n\"Gammon!\" said Mr. Sowerby; and as he said it he looked with a kind\nof derisive smile into the clergyman's face.\n\n\"It is easy enough to say that, Sowerby; and perhaps I have no right\nto expect that you should understand me.\"\n\n\"Ah, but I do understand you; and I say it is gammon. I would be the\nlast man in the world to ridicule your scruples about duty, if this\nhesitation on your part arose from any such scruple. But answer me\nhonestly, do you not know that such is not the case?\"\n\n\"I know nothing of the kind.\"\n\n\"Ah, but I think you do. If you persist in refusing this invitation\nwill it not be because you are afraid of making Lady Lufton angry? I\ndo not know what there can be in that woman that she is able to hold\nboth you and Lufton in leading-strings.\"\n\nRobarts, of course, denied the charge and protested that he was not\nto be taken back to his own parsonage by any fear of Lady Lufton.\nBut though he made such protest with warmth, he knew that he did so\nineffectually. Sowerby only smiled and said that the proof of the\npudding was in the eating.\n\n\"What is the good of a man keeping a curate if it be not to save him\nfrom that sort of drudgery?\" he asked.\n\n\"Drudgery! If I were a drudge how could I be here to-day?\"\n\n\"Well, Robarts, look here. I am speaking now, perhaps, with more of\nthe energy of an old friend than circumstances fully warrant; but\nI am an older man than you, and as I have a regard for you I do not\nlike to see you throw up a good game when it is in your hands.\"\n\n\"Oh, as far as that goes, Sowerby, I need hardly tell you that I\nappreciate your kindness.\"\n\n\"If you are content,\" continued the man of the world, \"to live at\nFramley all your life, and to warm yourself in the sunshine of the\ndowager there, why, in such case, it may perhaps be useless for you\nto extend the circle of your friends; but if you have higher ideas\nthan these, I think you will be very wrong to omit the present\nopportunity of going to the duke's. I never knew the duke go so much\nout of his way to be civil to a clergyman as he has done in this\ninstance.\"\n\n\"I am sure I am very much obliged to him.\"\n\n\"The fact is, that you may, if you please, make yourself popular\nin the county; but you cannot do it by obeying all Lady Lufton's\nbehests. She is a dear old woman, I am sure.\"\n\n\"She is, Sowerby; and you would say so, if you knew her.\"\n\n\"I don't doubt it; but it would not do for you or me to live exactly\naccording to her ideas. Now, here, in this case, the bishop of the\ndiocese is to be one of the party, and he has, I believe, already\nexpressed a wish that you should be another.\"\n\n\"He asked me if I were going.\"\n\n\"Exactly; and Archdeacon Grantly will be there.\"\n\n\"Will he?\" asked Mark. Now, that would be a great point gained, for\nArchdeacon Grantly was a close friend of Lady Lufton.\n\n\"So I understand from Fothergill. Indeed, it will be very wrong of\nyou not to go, and I tell you so plainly; and what is more, when you\ntalk about your duty--you having a curate as you have--why, it is\ngammon.\" These last words he spoke looking back over his shoulder\nas he stood up in his stirrups, for he had caught the eye of the\nhuntsman, who was surrounded by his hounds, and was now trotting on\nto join him.\n\nDuring a great portion of the day, Mark found himself riding by the\nside of Mrs. Proudie, as that lady leaned back in her carriage. And\nMrs. Proudie smiled on him graciously, though her daughter would not\ndo so. Mrs. Proudie was fond of having an attendant clergyman; and\nas it was evident that Mr. Robarts lived among nice people--titled\ndowagers, members of Parliament, and people of that sort--she was\nquite willing to instal him as a sort of honorary chaplain _pro tem_.\n\n\"I'll tell you what we have settled, Mrs. Harold Smith and I,\" said\nMrs. Proudie to him. \"This lecture at Barchester will be so late on\nSaturday evening, that you had all better come and dine with us.\"\n\nMark bowed and thanked her, and declared that he should be very happy\nto make one of such a party. Even Lady Lufton could not object to\nthis, although she was not especially fond of Mrs. Proudie.\n\n\"And then they are to sleep at the hotel. It will really be too late\nfor ladies to think of going back so far at this time of the year. I\ntold Mrs. Harold Smith, and Miss Dunstable, too, that we could manage\nto make room at any rate for them. But they will not leave the other\nladies; so they go to the hotel for that night. But, Mr. Robarts, the\nbishop will never allow you to stay at the inn, so of course you will\ntake a bed at the palace.\"\n\nIt immediately occurred to Mark that as the lecture was to be given\non Saturday evening, the next morning would be Sunday; and, on that\nSunday, he would have to preach at Chaldicotes. \"I thought they were\nall going to return the same night,\" said he.\n\n\"Well, they did intend it; but you see Mrs. Smith is afraid.\"\n\n\"I should have to get back here on the Sunday morning, Mrs. Proudie.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes, that is bad--very bad, indeed. No one dislikes any\ninterference with the Sabbath more than I do. Indeed, if I am\nparticular about anything it is about that. But some works are works\nof necessity, Mr. Robarts; are they not? Now you must necessarily\nbe back at Chaldicotes on Sunday morning!\" And so the matter was\nsettled. Mrs. Proudie was very firm in general in the matter of\nSabbath-day observances; but when she had to deal with such persons\nas Mrs. Harold Smith, it was expedient that she should give way a\nlittle. \"You can start as soon as it's daylight, you know, if you\nlike it, Mr. Robarts,\" said Mrs. Proudie.\n\nThere was not much to boast of as to the hunting, but it was a very\npleasant day for the ladies. The men rode up and down the grass roads\nthrough the Chace, sometimes in the greatest possible hurry as though\nthey never could go quick enough; and then the coachmen would drive\nvery fast also, though they did not know why, for a fast pace of\nmovement is another of those contagious diseases. And then again\nthe sportsmen would move at an undertaker's pace, when the fox had\ntraversed and the hounds would be at a loss to know which was the\nhunt and which was the heel; and then the carriage also would go\nslowly, and the ladies would stand up and talk. And then the time for\nlunch came; and altogether the day went by pleasantly enough.\n\n\"And so that's hunting, is it?\" said Miss Dunstable.\n\n\"Yes, that's hunting,\" said Mr. Sowerby.\n\n\"I did not see any gentleman do anything that I could not do myself,\nexcept there was one young man slipped off into the mud; and I\nshouldn't like that.\"\n\n\"But there was no breaking of bones, was there, my dear?\" said Mrs.\nHarold Smith.\n\n\"And nobody caught any foxes,\" said Miss Dunstable. \"The fact is,\nMrs. Smith, that I don't think much more of their sport than I do of\ntheir business. I shall take to hunting a pack of hounds myself after\nthis.\"\n\n\"Do, my dear, and I'll be your whipper-in. I wonder whether Mrs.\nProudie would join us.\"\n\n\"I shall be writing to the duke to-night,\" said Mr. Fothergill to\nMark, as they were all riding up to the stable-yard together. \"You\nwill let me tell his grace that you will accept his invitation--will\nyou not?\"\n\n\"Upon my word, the duke is very kind,\" said Mark.\n\n\"He is very anxious to know you, I can assure you,\" said Fothergill.\n\nWhat could a young flattered fool of a parson do, but say that he\nwould go? Mark did say that he would go; and in the course of the\nevening his friend Mr. Sowerby congratulated him, and the bishop\njoked with him and said that he knew that he would not give up good\ncompany so soon; and Miss Dunstable said she would make him her\nchaplain as soon as Parliament would allow quack doctors to have such\narticles--an allusion which Mark did not understand, till he learned\nthat Miss Dunstable was herself the proprietress of the celebrated\nOil of Lebanon, invented by her late respected father, and patented\nby him with such wonderful results in the way of accumulated fortune;\nand Mrs. Proudie made him quite one of their party, talking to him\nabout all manner of church subjects; and then at last, even Miss\nProudie smiled on him, when she learned that he had been thought\nworthy of a bed at a duke's castle. And all the world seemed to be\nopen to him.\n\nBut he could not make himself happy that evening. On the next morning\nhe must write to his wife; and he could already see the look of\npainful sorrow which would fall upon his Fanny's brow when she\nlearned that her husband was going to be a guest at the Duke of\nOmnium's. And he must tell her to send him money, and money was\nscarce. And then, as to Lady Lufton, should he send her some message,\nor should he not? In either case he must declare war against her. And\nthen did he not owe everything to Lady Lufton? And thus in spite of\nall his triumphs he could not get himself to bed in a happy frame of\nmind.\n\nOn the next day, which was Friday, he postponed the disagreeable\ntask of writing. Saturday would do as well; and on Saturday morning,\nbefore they all started for Barchester, he did write. And his letter\nran as follows:--\n\n\n   Chaldicotes, -- November, 185--.\n\n   DEAREST LOVE,--You will be astonished when I tell you how\n   gay we all are here, and what further dissipations are in\n   store for us. The Arabins, as you supposed, are not of\n   our party; but the Proudies are,--as you supposed also.\n   Your suppositions are always right. And what will you\n   think when I tell you that I am to sleep at the palace\n   on Saturday? You know that there is to be a lecture in\n   Barchester on that day. Well; we must all go, of course,\n   as Harold Smith, one of our set here, is to give it. And\n   now it turns out that we cannot get back the same night\n   because there is no moon; and Mrs. Bishop would not allow\n   that my cloth should be contaminated by an hotel;--very\n   kind and considerate, is it not?\n\n   But I have a more astounding piece of news for you than\n   this. There is to be a great party at Gatherum Castle\n   next week, and they have talked me over into accepting an\n   invitation which the duke sent expressly to me. I refused\n   at first; but everybody here said that my doing so would\n   be so strange; and then they all wanted to know my reason.\n   When I came to render it, I did not know what reason I had\n   to give. The bishop is going, and he thought it very odd\n   that I should not go also, seeing that I was asked.\n\n   I know what my own darling will think, and I know that she\n   will not be pleased, and I must put off my defence till I\n   return to her from this ogre-land,--if ever I do get back\n   alive. But joking apart, Fanny, I think that I should\n   have been wrong to stand out, when so much was said about\n   it. I should have been seeming to take upon myself to\n   sit in judgment upon the duke. I doubt if there be a\n   single clergyman in the diocese, under fifty years of\n   age, who would have refused the invitation under such\n   circumstances,--unless it be Crawley, who is so mad on the\n   subject that he thinks it almost wrong to take a walk out\n   of his own parish.\n\n   I must stay at Gatherum Castle over Sunday week--indeed,\n   we only go there on Friday. I have written to Jones about\n   the duties. I can make it up to him, as I know he wishes\n   to go into Wales at Christmas. My wanderings will all be\n   over then, and he may go for a couple of months if he\n   pleases. I suppose you will take my classes in the school\n   on Sunday, as well as your own; but pray make them have a\n   good fire. If this is too much for you, make Mrs. Podgens\n   take the boys. Indeed I think that will be better.\n\n   Of course you will tell her ladyship of my whereabouts.\n   Tell her from me, that as regards the bishop, as well as\n   regarding another great personage, the colour has been\n   laid on perhaps a little too thickly. Not that Lady Lufton\n   would ever like him. Make her understand that my going to\n   the duke's has almost become a matter of conscience with\n   me. I have not known how to make it appear that it would\n   be right for me to refuse, without absolutely making a\n   party matter of it. I saw that it would be said, that I,\n   coming from Lady Lufton's parish, could not go to the Duke\n   of Omnium's. This I did not choose.\n\n   I find that I shall want a little more money before I\n   leave here, five or ten pounds--say ten pounds. If you\n   cannot spare it, get it from Davis. He owes me more than\n   that, a good deal.\n\n   And now, God bless and preserve you, my own love. Kiss my\n   darling bairns for papa, and give them my blessing.\n\n   Always and ever your own,\n\n   M. R.\n\n\nAnd then there was written, on an outside scrap which was folded\nround the full-written sheet of paper, \"Make it as smooth at Framley\nCourt as possible.\"\n\nHowever strong, and reasonable, and unanswerable the body of Mark's\nletter may have been, all his hesitation, weakness, doubt, and fear,\nwere expressed in this short postscript.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nAMANTIUM IR\u00c3\u0086 AMORIS INTEGRATIO.\n\n\nAnd now, with my reader's consent, I will follow the postman with\nthat letter to Framley; not by its own circuitous route indeed, or by\nthe same mode of conveyance; for that letter went into Barchester by\nthe Courcy night mail-cart, which, on its road, passes through the\nvillages of Uffley and Chaldicotes, reaching Barchester in time for\nthe up mail-train to London. By that train, the letter was sent\ntowards the metropolis as far as the junction of the Barset branch\nline, but there it was turned in its course, and came down again by\nthe main line as far as Silverbridge; at which place, between six\nand seven in the morning, it was shouldered by the Framley footpost\nmessenger, and in due course delivered at the Framley Parsonage\nexactly as Mrs. Robarts had finished reading prayers to the four\nservants. Or, I should say rather, that such would in its usual\ncourse have been that letter's destiny. As it was, however, it\nreached Silverbridge on Sunday, and lay there till the Monday, as\nthe Framley people have declined their Sunday post. And then again,\nwhen the letter was delivered at the parsonage, on that wet Monday\nmorning, Mrs. Robarts was not at home. As we are all aware, she was\nstaying with her ladyship at Framley Court.\n\n\"Oh, but it's mortial wet,\" said the shivering postman as he handed\nin that and the vicar's newspaper. The vicar was a man of the world,\nand took the _Jupiter_.\n\n\"Come in, Robin postman, and warm theeself awhile,\" said Jemima the\ncook, pushing a stool a little to one side, but still well in front\nof the big kitchen fire.\n\n\"Well, I dudna jist know how it'll be. The wery 'edges 'as eyes\nand tells on me in Silverbridge, if I so much as stops to pick a\nblackberry.\"\n\n\"There bain't no hedges here, mon, nor yet no blackberries; so sit\nthee down and warm theeself. That's better nor blackberries I'm\nthinking,\" and she handed him a bowl of tea with a slice of buttered\ntoast.\n\nRobin postman took the proffered tea, put his dripping hat on the\nground, and thanked Jemima cook. \"But I dudna jist know how it'll\nbe,\" said he; \"only it do pour so tarnation heavy.\" Which among us,\nO my readers, could have withstood that temptation?\n\nSuch was the circuitous course of Mark's letter; but as it left\nChaldicotes on Saturday evening, and reached Mrs. Robarts on the\nfollowing morning, or would have done, but for that intervening\nSunday, doing all its peregrinations during the night, it may be held\nthat its course of transport was not inconveniently arranged. We,\nhowever, will travel by a much shorter route.\n\nRobin, in the course of his daily travels, passed, first the\npost-office at Framley, then the Framley Court back entrance, and\nthen the vicar's house, so that on this wet morning Jemima cook was\nnot able to make use of his services in transporting this letter back\nto her mistress; for Robin had got another village before him,\nexpectant of its letters.\n\n\"Why didn't thee leave it, mon, with Mr. Applejohn at the Court?\" Mr.\nApplejohn was the butler who took the letter-bag. \"Thee know'st as\nhow missus was there.\"\n\nAnd then Robin, mindful of the tea and toast, explained to her\ncourteously how the law made it imperative on him to bring the letter\nto the very house that was indicated, let the owner of the letter be\nwhere she might; and he laid down the law very satisfactorily with\nsundry long-worded quotations. Not to much effect, however, for the\nhousemaid called him an oaf; and Robin would decidedly have had the\nworst of it had not the gardener come in and taken his part. \"They\nwomen knows nothin', and understands nothin',\" said the gardener.\n\"Give us hold of the letter. I'll take it up to the house. It's the\nmaster's fist.\" And then Robin postman went on one way, and the\ngardener, he went the other. The gardener never disliked an excuse\nfor going up to the Court gardens, even on so wet a day as this.\n\nMrs. Robarts was sitting over the drawing-room fire with Lady\nMeredith, when her husband's letter was brought to her. The Framley\nCourt letter-bag had been discussed at breakfast; but that was now\nnearly an hour since, and Lady Lufton, as was her wont, was away\nin her own room writing her own letters, and looking after her own\nmatters: for Lady Lufton was a person who dealt in figures herself,\nand understood business almost as well as Harold Smith. And on that\nmorning she also had received a letter which had displeased her not\na little. Whence arose this displeasure neither Mrs. Robarts nor Lady\nMeredith knew; but her ladyship's brow had grown black at breakfast\ntime; she had bundled up an ominous-looking epistle into her bag\nwithout speaking of it, and had left the room immediately that\nbreakfast was over.\n\n\"There's something wrong,\" said Sir George.\n\n\"Mamma does fret herself so much about Ludovic's money matters,\" said\nLady Meredith. Ludovic was Lord Lufton,--Ludovic Lufton, Baron Lufton\nof Lufton, in the county of Oxfordshire.\n\n\"And yet I don't think Lufton gets much astray,\" said Sir George,\nas he sauntered out of the room. \"Well, Justy; we'll put off going\nthen till to-morrow; but remember, it must be the first train.\"\nLady Meredith said she would remember, and then they went into the\ndrawing-room, and there Mrs. Robarts received her letter.\n\nFanny, when she read it, hardly at first realized to herself the\nidea that her husband, the clergyman of Framley, the family clerical\nfriend of Lady Lufton's establishment, was going to stay with the\nDuke of Omnium. It was so thoroughly understood at Framley Court that\nthe duke and all belonging to him was noxious and damnable. He was a\nWhig, he was a bachelor, he was a gambler, he was immoral in every\nway, he was a man of no church principle, a corrupter of youth, a\nsworn foe of young wives, a swallower up of small men's patrimonies;\na man whom mothers feared for their sons, and sisters for their\nbrothers; and worse again, whom fathers had cause to fear for their\ndaughters, and brothers for their sisters;--a man who, with his\nbelongings, dwelt, and must dwell, poles asunder from Lady Lufton and\nher belongings!\n\nAnd it must be remembered that all these evil things were fully\nbelieved by Mrs. Robarts. Could it really be that her husband was\ngoing to dwell in the halls of Apollyon, to shelter himself beneath\nthe wings of this very Lucifer? A cloud of sorrow settled upon her\nface, and then she read the letter again very slowly, not omitting\nthe tell-tale postscript.\n\n\"Oh, Justinia!\" at last she said.\n\n\"What, have you got bad news, too?\"\n\n\"I hardly know how to tell you what has occurred. There; I suppose\nyou had better read it;\" and she handed her husband's epistle to Lady\nMeredith,--keeping back, however, the postscript.\n\n\"What on earth will her ladyship say now?\" said Lady Meredith, as she\nfolded the paper, and replaced it in the envelope.\n\n\"What had I better do, Justinia? how had I better tell her?\" And then\nthe two ladies put their heads together, bethinking themselves how\nthey might best deprecate the wrath of Lady Lufton. It had been\narranged that Mrs. Robarts should go back to the parsonage after\nlunch, and she had persisted in her intention after it had been\nsettled that the Merediths were to stay over that evening. Lady\nMeredith now advised her friend to carry out this determination\nwithout saying anything about her husband's terrible iniquities, and\nthen to send the letter up to Lady Lufton as soon as she reached the\nparsonage. \"Mamma will never know that you received it here,\" said\nLady Meredith.\n\nBut Mrs. Robarts would not consent to this. Such a course seemed to\nher to be cowardly. She knew that her husband was doing wrong; she\nfelt that he knew it himself; but still it was necessary that she\nshould defend him. However terrible might be the storm, it must break\nupon her own head. So she at once went up and tapped at Lady Lufton's\nprivate door; and as she did so Lady Meredith followed her.\n\n\"Come in,\" said Lady Lufton, and the voice did not sound soft and\npleasant. When they entered, they found her sitting at her little\nwriting table, with her head resting on her arm, and that letter\nwhich she had received that morning was lying open on the table\nbefore her. Indeed there were two letters now there, one from a\nLondon lawyer to herself, and the other from her son to that London\nlawyer. It needs only be explained that the subject of those letters\nwas the immediate sale of that outlying portion of the Lufton\nproperty in Oxfordshire, as to which Mr. Sowerby once spoke. Lord\nLufton had told the lawyer that the thing must be done at once,\nadding that his friend Robarts would have explained the whole affair\nto his mother. And then the lawyer had written to Lady Lufton, as\nindeed was necessary; but unfortunately Lady Lufton had not hitherto\nheard a word of the matter.\n\nIn her eyes the sale of family property was horrible; the fact that a\nyoung man with some fifteen or twenty thousand a year should require\nsubsidiary money was horrible; that her own son should have not\nwritten to her himself was horrible; and it was also horrible that\nher own pet, the clergyman whom she had brought there to be her\nson's friend, should be mixed up in the matter,--should be cognizant\nof it while she was not cognizant,--should be employed in it as a\ngo-between and agent in her son's bad courses. It was all horrible,\nand Lady Lufton was sitting there with a black brow and an uneasy\nheart. As regarded our poor parson, we may say that in this matter\nhe was blameless, except that he had hitherto lacked the courage to\nexecute his friend's commission.\n\n\"What is it, Fanny?\" said Lady Lufton as soon as the door was opened;\n\"I should have been down in half-an-hour, if you wanted me,\nJustinia.\"\n\n\"Fanny has received a letter which makes her wish to speak to you at\nonce,\" said Lady Meredith. \"What letter, Fanny?\"\n\nPoor Fanny's heart was in her mouth; she held it in her hand, but had\nnot yet quite made up her mind whether she would show it bodily to\nLady Lufton.\n\n\"From Mr. Robarts,\" she said.\n\n\"Well; I suppose he is going to stay another week at Chaldicotes. For\nmy part I should be as well pleased;\" and Lady Lufton's voice was\nnot friendly, for she was thinking of that farm in Oxfordshire. The\nimprudence of the young is very sore to the prudence of their elders.\nNo woman could be less covetous, less grasping than Lady Lufton; but\nthe sale of a portion of the old family property was to her as the\nloss of her own heart's blood.\n\n\"Here is the letter, Lady Lufton; perhaps you had better read it;\"\nand Fanny handed it to her, again keeping back the postscript. She\nhad read and re-read the letter downstairs, but could not make out\nwhether her husband had intended her to show it. From the line of the\nargument she thought that he must have done so. At any rate he said\nfor himself more than she could say for him, and so, probably, it was\nbest that her ladyship should see it.\n\nLady Lufton took it, and read it, and her face grew blacker and\nblacker. Her mind was set against the writer before she began it, and\nevery word in it tended to make her feel more estranged from him.\n\"Oh, he is going to the palace, is he?--well; he must choose his own\nfriends. Harold Smith one of his party! It's a pity, my dear, he did\nnot see Miss Proudie before he met you, he might have lived to be the\nbishop's chaplain. Gatherum Castle! You don't mean to tell me that he\nis going there? Then I tell you fairly, Fanny, that I have done with\nhim.\"\n\n\"Oh, Lady Lufton, don't say that,\" said Mrs. Robarts, with tears in\nher eyes.\n\n\"Mamma, mamma, don't speak in that way,\" said Lady Meredith.\n\n\"But my dear, what am I to say? I must speak in that way. You would\nnot wish me to speak falsehoods, would you? A man must choose for\nhimself, but he can't live with two different sets of people; at\nleast, not if I belong to one and the Duke of Omnium to the other.\nThe bishop going indeed! If there be anything that I hate it is\nhypocrisy.\"\n\n\"There is no hypocrisy in that, Lady Lufton.\"\n\n\"But I say there is, Fanny. Very strange, indeed! 'Put off his\ndefence!' Why should a man need any defence to his wife if he acts in\na straightforward way? His own language condemns him: 'Wrong to stand\nout!' Now, will either of you tell me that Mr. Robarts would really\nhave thought it wrong to refuse that invitation? I say that that is\nhypocrisy. There is no other word for it.\"\n\nBy this time the poor wife, who had been in tears, was wiping them\naway and preparing for action. Lady Lufton's extreme severity gave\nher courage. She knew that it behoved her to fight for her husband\nwhen he was thus attacked. Had Lady Lufton been moderate in her\nremarks Mrs. Robarts would not have had a word to say.\n\n\"My husband may have been ill-judged,\" she said, \"but he is no\nhypocrite.\"\n\n\"Very well, my dear, I dare say you know better than I; but to me it\nlooks extremely like hypocrisy: eh, Justinia?\"\n\n\"Oh, mamma, do be moderate.\"\n\n\"Moderate! That's all very well. How is one to moderate one's\nfeelings when one has been betrayed?\"\n\n\"You do not mean that Mr. Robarts has betrayed you?\" said the wife.\n\n\"Oh, no; of course not.\" And then she went on reading the letter:\n\"'Seem to have been standing in judgment upon the duke.' Might he\nnot use the same argument as to going into any house in the kingdom,\nhowever infamous? We must all stand in judgment one upon another in\nthat sense. 'Crawley!' Yes; if he were a little more like Mr. Crawley\nit would be a good thing for me, and for the parish, and for you too,\nmy dear. God forgive me for bringing him here; that's all.\"\n\n\"Lady Lufton, I must say that you are very hard upon him--very hard.\nI did not expect it from such a friend.\"\n\n\"My dear, you ought to know me well enough to be sure that I shall\nspeak my mind. 'Written to Jones'--yes; it is easy enough to write to\npoor Jones. He had better write to Jones, and bid him do the whole\nduty. Then he can go and be the duke's domestic chaplain.\"\n\n\"I believe my husband does as much of his own duty as any clergyman\nin the whole diocese,\" said Mrs. Robarts, now again in tears.\n\n\"And you are to take his work in the school; you and Mrs. Podgens.\nWhat with his curate and his wife and Mrs. Podgens, I don't see why\nhe should come back at all.\"\n\n\"Oh, mamma,\" said Justinia, \"pray, pray don't be so harsh to her.\"\n\n\"Let me finish it, my dear;--oh, here I come. 'Tell her ladyship my\nwhereabouts.' He little thought you'd show me this letter.\"\n\n\"Didn't he?\" said Mrs. Robarts, putting out her hand to get it back,\nbut in vain. \"I thought it was for the best; I did indeed.\"\n\n\"I had better finish it now, if you please. What is this? How does\nhe dare send his ribald jokes to me in such a matter? No, I do not\nsuppose I ever shall like Dr. Proudie; I have never expected it. A\nmatter of conscience with him! Well--well, well. Had I not read it\nmyself, I could not have believed it of him. I would not positively\nhave believed it. 'Coming from my parish he could not go to the Duke\nof Omnium!' And it is what I would wish to have said. People fit for\nthis parish should not be fit for the Duke of Omnium's house. And I\nhad trusted that he would have this feeling more strongly than any\none else in it. I have been deceived--that's all.\"\n\n\"He has done nothing to deceive you, Lady Lufton.\"\n\n\"I hope he will not have deceived you, my dear. 'More money;' yes,\nit is probable that he will want more money. There is your letter,\nFanny. I am very sorry for it. I can say nothing more.\" And she\nfolded up the letter and gave it back to Mrs. Robarts.\n\n\"I thought it right to show it you,\" said Mrs. Robarts.\n\n\"It did not much matter whether you did or no; of course I must have\nbeen told.\"\n\n\"He especially begs me to tell you.\"\n\n\"Why, yes; he could not very well have kept me in the dark in such\na matter. He could not neglect his own work, and go and live with\ngamblers and adulterers at the Duke of Omnium's without my knowing\nit.\"\n\nAnd now Fanny Robarts's cup was full, full to the overflowing. When\nshe heard these words she forgot all about Lady Lufton, all about\nLady Meredith, and remembered only her husband,--that he was her\nhusband, and, in spite of his faults, a good and loving husband;--and\nthat other fact also she remembered, that she was his wife.\n\n\"Lady Lufton,\" she said, \"you forget yourself in speaking in that way\nof my husband.\"\n\n\"What!\" said her ladyship; \"you are to show me such a letter as that,\nand I am not to tell you what I think?\"\n\n\"Not if you think such hard things as that. Even you are not\njustified in speaking to me in that way, and I will not hear it.\"\n\n\"Heighty-tighty!\" said her ladyship.\n\n\"Whether or no he is right in going to the Duke of Omnium's, I will\nnot pretend to judge. He is the judge of his own actions, and neither\nyou nor I.\"\n\n\"And when he leaves you with the butcher's bill unpaid and no money\nto buy shoes for the children, who will be the judge then?\"\n\n\"Not you, Lady Lufton. If such bad days should ever come--and neither\nyou nor I have a right to expect them--I will not come to you in my\ntroubles; not after this.\"\n\n\"Very well, my dear. You may go to the Duke of Omnium if that suits\nyou better.\"\n\n\"Fanny, come away,\" said Lady Meredith. \"Why should you try to anger\nmy mother?\"\n\n\"I don't want to anger her; but I won't hear him abused in that way\nwithout speaking up for him. If I don't defend him, who will? Lady\nLufton has said terrible things about him; and they are not true.\"\n\n\"Oh, Fanny!\" said Justinia.\n\n\"Very well, very well!\" said Lady Lufton. \"This is the sort of return\nthat one gets.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you mean by return, Lady Lufton: but would you\nwish me to stand by quietly and hear such things said of my husband?\nHe does not live with such people as you have named. He does not\nneglect his duties. If every clergyman were as much in his parish,\nit would be well for some of them. And in going to such a house as\nthe Duke of Omnium's it does make a difference that he goes there\nin company with the bishop. I can't explain why, but I know that it\ndoes.\"\n\n\"Especially when the bishop is coupled up with the devil, as Mr.\nRobarts has done,\" said Lady Lufton; \"he can join the duke with them\nand then they'll stand for the three Graces, won't they, Justinia?\"\nAnd Lady Lufton laughed a bitter little laugh at her own wit.\n\n\"I suppose I may go now, Lady Lufton.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, certainly, my dear.\"\n\n\"I am sorry if I have made you angry with me; but I will not allow\nany one to speak against Mr. Robarts without answering them. You have\nbeen very unjust to him; and even though I do anger you, I must say\nso.\"\n\n\"Come, Fanny; this is too bad,\" said Lady Lufton. \"You have been\nscolding me for the last half-hour because I would not congratulate\nyou on this new friend that your husband has made, and now you are\ngoing to begin it all over again. That is more than I can stand. If\nyou have nothing else particular to say, you might as well leave me.\"\nAnd Lady Lufton's face as she spoke was unbending, severe, and harsh.\n\nMrs. Robarts had never before been so spoken to by her old friend;\nindeed she had never been so spoken to by any one, and she hardly\nknew how to bear herself.\n\n\"Very well, Lady Lufton,\" she said; \"then I will go. Good-bye.\"\n\n\"Good-bye,\" said Lady Lufton, and turning herself to her table she\nbegan to arrange her papers. Fanny had never before left Framley\nCourt to go back to her own parsonage without a warm embrace. Now she\nwas to do so without even having her hand taken. Had it come to this,\nthat there was absolutely to be a quarrel between them,--a quarrel\nfor ever?\n\n\"Fanny is going, you know, mamma,\" said Lady Meredith. \"She will be\nhome before you are down again.\"\n\n\"I cannot help it, my dear. Fanny must do as she pleases. I am not to\nbe the judge of her actions. She has just told me so.\"\n\nMrs. Robarts had said nothing of the kind, but she was far too\nproud to point this out. So with a gentle step she retreated\nthrough the door, and then Lady Meredith, having tried what a\nconciliatory whisper with her mother would do, followed her. Alas,\nthe conciliatory whisper was altogether ineffectual!\n\nThe two ladies said nothing as they descended the stairs, but when\nthey had regained the drawing-room they looked with blank horror into\neach other's faces. What were they to do now? Of such a tragedy as\nthis they had had no remotest preconception. Was it absolutely the\ncase that Fanny Robarts was to walk out of Lady Lufton's house as a\ndeclared enemy,--she who, before her marriage as well as since, had\nbeen almost treated as an adopted daughter of the family?\n\n\"Oh, Fanny, why did you answer my mother in that way?\" said Lady\nMeredith. \"You saw that she was vexed. She had other things to vex\nher besides this about Mr. Robarts.\"\n\n\"And would not you answer any one who attacked Sir George?\"\n\n\"No, not my own mother. I would let her say what she pleased, and\nleave Sir George to fight his own battles.\"\n\n\"Ah, but it is different with you. You are her daughter, and Sir\nGeorge--she would not dare to speak in that way as to Sir George's\ndoings.\"\n\n\"Indeed she would, if it pleased her. I am sorry I let you go up to\nher.\"\n\n\"It is as well that it should be over, Justinia. As those are her\nthoughts about Mr. Robarts, it is quite as well that we should know\nthem. Even for all that I owe to her, and all the love I bear to you,\nI will not come to this house if I am to hear my husband abused;--not\ninto any house.\"\n\n\"My dearest Fanny, we all know what happens when two angry people get\ntogether.\"\n\n\"I was not angry when I went up to her; not in the least.\"\n\n\"It is no good looking back. What are we to do now, Fanny?\"\n\n\"I suppose I had better go home,\" said Mrs. Robarts. \"I will go and\nput my things up, and then I will send James for them.\"\n\n\"Wait till after lunch, and then you will be able to kiss my mother\nbefore you leave us.\"\n\n\"No, Justinia; I cannot wait. I must answer Mr. Robarts by this post,\nand I must think what I have to say to him. I could not write that\nletter here, and the post goes at four.\" And Mrs. Robarts got up from\nher chair, preparatory to her final departure.\n\n\"I shall come to you before dinner,\" said Lady Meredith; \"and if I\ncan bring you good tidings, I shall expect you to come back here with\nme. It is out of the question that I should go away from Framley\nleaving you and my mother at enmity with each other.\"\n\nTo this Mrs. Robarts made no answer; and in a very few minutes\nafterwards she was in her own nursery, kissing her children, and\nteaching the elder one to say something about papa. But, even as she\ntaught him, the tears stood in her eyes, and the little fellow knew\nthat everything was not right.\n\nAnd there she sat till about two, doing little odds and ends of\nthings for the children, and allowing that occupation to stand as an\nexcuse to her for not commencing her letter. But then there remained\nonly two hours to her, and it might be that the letter would be\ndifficult in the writing--would require thought and changes, and must\nneeds be copied, perhaps more than once. As to the money, that she\nhad in the house--as much, at least, as Mark now wanted, though the\nsending of it would leave her nearly penniless. She could, however,\nin case of personal need, resort to Davis as desired by him.\n\nSo she got out her desk in the drawing-room and sat down and wrote\nher letter. It was difficult, though she found that it hardly took so\nlong as she expected. It was difficult, for she felt bound to tell\nhim the truth; and yet she was anxious not to spoil all his pleasure\namong his friends. She told him, however, that Lady Lufton was very\nangry, \"unreasonably angry, I must say,\" she put in, in order to\nshow that she had not sided against him. \"And indeed we have quite\nquarrelled, and this has made me unhappy, as it will you, dearest;\nI know that. But we both know how good she is at heart, and Justinia\nthinks that she had other things to trouble her; and I hope it will\nall be made up before you come home; only, dearest Mark, pray do not\nbe longer than you said in your last letter.\" And then there were\nthree or four paragraphs about the babies and two about the schools,\nwhich I may as well omit.\n\nShe had just finished her letter, and was carefully folding it for\nits envelope, with the two whole five-pound notes imprudently placed\nwithin it, when she heard a footstep on the gravel path which led\nup from a small wicket to the front-door. The path ran near the\ndrawing-room window, and she was just in time to catch a glimpse\nof the last fold of a passing cloak. \"It is Justinia,\" she said\nto herself; and her heart became disturbed at the idea of again\ndiscussing the morning's adventure. \"What am I to do,\" she had said\nto herself before, \"if she wants me to beg her pardon? I will not own\nbefore her that he is in the wrong.\"\n\nAnd then the door opened--for the visitor made her entrance without\nthe aid of any servant--and Lady Lufton herself stood before her.\n\"Fanny,\" she said at once, \"I have come to beg your pardon.\"\n\n\"Oh, Lady Lufton!\"\n\n\"I was very much harassed when you came to me just now;--by more\nthings than one, my dear. But, nevertheless, I should not have spoken\nto you of your husband as I did, and so I have come to beg your\npardon.\"\n\nMrs. Robarts was past answering by the time that this was said,--past\nanswering at least in words; so she jumped up and, with her eyes\nfull of tears, threw herself into her old friend's arms. \"Oh, Lady\nLufton!\" she sobbed forth again.\n\n\"You will forgive me, won't you?\" said her ladyship, as she returned\nher young friend's caress. \"Well, that's right. I have not been at\nall happy since you left my den this morning, and I don't suppose you\nhave. But, Fanny, dearest, we love each other too well and know each\nother too thoroughly, to have a long quarrel, don't we?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, Lady Lufton.\"\n\n\"Of course we do. Friends are not to be picked up on the road-side\nevery day; nor are they to be thrown away lightly. And now sit down,\nmy love, and let us have a little talk. There, I must take my bonnet\noff. You have pulled the strings so that you have almost choked me.\"\nAnd Lady Lufton deposited her bonnet on the table and seated herself\ncomfortably in the corner of the sofa.\n\n\"My dear,\" she said, \"there is no duty which any woman owes to any\nother human being at all equal to that which she owes to her husband,\nand, therefore, you were quite right to stand up for Mr. Robarts this\nmorning.\"\n\nUpon this Mrs. Robarts said nothing, but she got her hand within that\nof her ladyship and gave it a slight squeeze.\n\n\"And I loved you for what you were doing all the time. I did, my\ndear; though you were a little fierce, you know. Even Justinia admits\nthat, and she has been at me ever since you went away. And indeed,\nI did not know that it was in you to look in that way out of those\npretty eyes of yours.\"\n\n\"Oh, Lady Lufton!\"\n\n\"But I looked fierce enough too myself, I dare say; so we'll say\nnothing more about that; will we? But now, about this good man of\nyours?\"\n\n\"Dear Lady Lufton, you must forgive him.\"\n\n\"Well: as you ask me, I will. We'll have nothing more said about the\nduke, either now or when he comes back; not a word. Let me see--he's\nto be back;--when is it?\"\n\n\"Wednesday week, I think.\"\n\n\"Ah, Wednesday. Well, tell him to come and dine up at the house on\nWednesday. He'll be in time, I suppose, and there shan't be a word\nsaid about this horrid duke.\"\n\n\"I am so much obliged to you, Lady Lufton.\"\n\n\"But look here, my dear; believe me, he's better off without such\nfriends.\"\n\n\"Oh, I know he is; much better off.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm glad you admit that, for I thought you seemed to be in\nfavour of the duke.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, Lady Lufton.\"\n\n\"That's right, then. And now, if you'll take my advice, you'll use\nyour influence, as a good, dear sweet wife as you are, to prevent his\ngoing there any more. I'm an old woman and he is a young man, and\nit's very natural that he should think me behind the times. I'm not\nangry at that. But he'll find that it's better for him, better for\nhim in every way, to stick to his old friends. It will be better for\nhis peace of mind, better for his character as a clergyman, better\nfor his pocket, better for his children and for you,--and better for\nhis eternal welfare. The duke is not such a companion as he should\nseek;--nor if he is sought, should he allow himself to be led away.\"\n\nAnd then Lady Lufton ceased, and Fanny Robarts kneeling at her feet\nsobbed, with her face hidden on her friend's knees. She had not\na word now to say as to her husband's capability of judging for\nhimself.\n\n\"And now I must be going again; but Justinia has made me\npromise,--promise, mind you, most solemnly, that I would have you\nback to dinner to-night,--by force if necessary. It was the only\nway I could make my peace with her; so you must not leave me in the\nlurch.\" Of course, Fanny said that she would go and dine at Framley\nCourt.\n\n\"And you must not send that letter, by any means,\" said her ladyship\nas she was leaving the room, poking with her umbrella at the epistle,\nwhich lay directed on Mrs. Robarts's desk. \"I can understand very\nwell what it contains. You must alter it altogether, my dear.\" And\nthen Lady Lufton went.\n\nMrs. Robarts instantly rushed to her desk and tore open her letter.\nShe looked at her watch and it was past four. She had hardly begun\nanother when the postman came. \"Oh, Mary,\" she said, \"do make him\nwait. If he'll wait a quarter of an hour I'll give him a shilling.\"\n\n\"There's no need of that, ma'am. Let him have a glass of beer.\"\n\n\"Very well, Mary; but don't give him too much, for fear he should\ndrop the letters about. I'll be ready in ten minutes.\"\n\nAnd in five minutes she had scrawled a very different sort of a\nletter. But he might want the money immediately, so she would not\ndelay it for a day.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nMR. HAROLD SMITH'S LECTURE.\n\n\nOn the whole the party at Chaldicotes was very pleasant, and the\ntime passed away quickly enough. Mr. Robarts's chief friend there,\nindependently of Mr. Sowerby, was Miss Dunstable, who seemed to take\na great fancy to him, whereas she was not very accessible to the\nblandishments of Mr. Supplehouse, nor more specially courteous\neven to her host than good manners required of her. But then Mr.\nSupplehouse and Mr. Sowerby were both bachelors, while Mark Robarts\nwas a married man.\n\nWith Mr. Sowerby Robarts had more than one communication respecting\nLord Lufton and his affairs, which he would willingly have avoided\nhad it been possible. Sowerby was one of those men who are always\nmixing up business with pleasure, and who have usually some scheme\nin their mind which requires forwarding. Men of this class have, as\na rule, no daily work, no regular routine of labour; but it may be\ndoubted whether they do not toil much more incessantly than those who\nhave.\n\n\"Lufton is so dilatory,\" Mr. Sowerby said. \"Why did he not arrange\nthis at once, when he promised it? And then he is so afraid of that\nold woman at Framley Court. Well, my dear fellow, say what you will;\nshe is an old woman and she'll never be younger. But do write to\nLufton and tell him that this delay is inconvenient to me; he'll do\nanything for you, I know.\"\n\nMark said that he would write, and, indeed, did do so; but he did not\nat first like the tone of the conversation into which he was dragged.\nIt was very painful to him to hear Lady Lufton called an old woman,\nand hardly less so to discuss the propriety of Lord Lufton's parting\nwith his property. This was irksome to him, till habit made it easy.\nBut by degrees his feelings became less acute, and he accustomed\nhimself to his friend Sowerby's mode of talking.\n\nAnd then on the Saturday afternoon they all went over to Barchester.\nHarold Smith during the last forty-eight hours had become crammed\nto overflowing with Sarawak, Labuan, New Guinea, and the Salomon\nIslands. As is the case with all men labouring under temporary\nspecialities, he for the time had faith in nothing else, and was\nnot content that any one near him should have any other faith. They\ncalled him Viscount Papua and Baron Borneo; and his wife, who headed\nthe joke against him, insisted on having her title. Miss Dunstable\nswore that she would wed none but a South Sea islander; and to Mark\nwas offered the income and duties of Bishop of Spices. Nor did the\nProudie family set themselves against these little sarcastic quips\nwith any overwhelming severity. It is sweet to unbend oneself at\nthe proper opportunity, and this was the proper opportunity for Mrs.\nProudie's unbending. No mortal can be seriously wise at all hours;\nand in these happy hours did that usually wise mortal, the bishop,\nlay aside for awhile his serious wisdom.\n\n\"We think of dining at five to-morrow, my Lady Papua,\" said the\nfacetious bishop; \"will that suit his lordship and the affairs of\nState? he! he! he!\" And the good prelate laughed at the fun.\n\nHow pleasantly young men and women of fifty or thereabouts can joke\nand flirt and poke their fun about, laughing and holding their sides,\ndealing in little innuendoes and rejoicing in nicknames when they\nhave no Mentors of twenty-five or thirty near them to keep them in\norder. The vicar of Framley might perhaps have been regarded as such\na Mentor, were it not for that capability of adapting himself to the\ncompany immediately around him on which he so much piqued himself.\nHe therefore also talked to my Lady Papua, and was jocose about\nthe Baron,--not altogether to the satisfaction of Mr. Harold Smith\nhimself.\n\nFor Mr. Harold Smith was in earnest and did not quite relish these\njocundities. He had an idea that he could in about three months talk\nthe British world into civilizing New Guinea, and that the world of\nBarsetshire would be made to go with him by one night's efforts.\nHe did not understand why others should be less serious, and was\ninclined to resent somewhat stiffly the amenities of our friend Mark.\n\n\"We must not keep the Baron waiting,\" said Mark, as they were\npreparing to start for Barchester.\n\n\"I don't know what you mean by the Baron, sir,\" said Harold Smith.\n\"But perhaps the joke will be against you, when you are getting\nup into your pulpit to-morrow and sending the hat round among the\nclodhoppers of Chaldicotes.\"\n\n\"Those who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones; eh, Baron?\"\nsaid Miss Dunstable. \"Mr. Robarts's sermon will be too near akin to\nyour lecture to allow of his laughing.\"\n\n\"If we can do nothing towards instructing the outer world till it's\ndone by the parsons,\" said Harold Smith, \"the outer world will have\nto wait a long time, I fear.\"\n\n\"Nobody can do anything of that kind short of a member of Parliament\nand a would-be minister,\" whispered Mrs. Harold.\n\nAnd so they were all very pleasant together, in spite of a little\nfencing with edge-tools; and at three o'clock the _cort\u00c3\u00a9ge_ of\ncarriages started for Barchester, that of the bishop, of course,\nleading the way. His lordship, however, was not in it.\n\n\"Mrs. Proudie, I'm sure you'll let me go with you,\" said Miss\nDunstable, at the last moment, as she came down the big stone steps.\n\"I want to hear the rest of that story about Mr. Slope.\"\n\nNow this upset everything. The bishop was to have gone with his wife,\nMrs. Smith, and Mark Robarts; and Mr. Sowerby had so arranged matters\nthat he could have accompanied Miss Dunstable in his phaeton. But no\none ever dreamed of denying Miss Dunstable anything. Of course Mark\ngave way; but it ended in the bishop declaring that he had no special\npredilection for his own carriage, which he did in compliance with a\nglance from his wife's eye. Then other changes of course followed,\nand, at last, Mr. Sowerby and Harold Smith were the joint occupants\nof the phaeton.\n\nThe poor lecturer, as he seated himself, made some remark such as\nthose he had been making for the last two days--for out of a full\nheart the mouth speaketh. But he spoke to an impatient listener.\n\"D---- the South Sea islanders,\" said Mr. Sowerby. \"You'll have it\nall your own way in a few minutes, like a bull in a china-shop; but\nfor Heaven's sake let us have a little peace till that time comes.\"\nIt appeared that Mr. Sowerby's little plan of having Miss Dunstable\nfor his companion was not quite insignificant; and, indeed, it may be\nsaid that but few of his little plans were so. At the present moment\nhe flung himself back in the carriage and prepared for sleep. He\ncould further no plan of his by a _t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aate_ conversation with his\nbrother-in-law.\n\nAnd then Mrs. Proudie began her story about Mr. Slope, or rather\nrecommenced it. She was very fond of talking about this gentleman,\nwho had once been her pet chaplain but was now her bitterest foe; and\nin telling the story, she had sometimes to whisper to Miss Dunstable,\nfor there were one or two fie-fie little anecdotes about a married\nlady, not altogether fit for young Mr. Robarts's ears. But Mrs.\nHarold Smith insisted on having them out loud, and Miss Dunstable\nwould gratify that lady in spite of Mrs. Proudie's winks.\n\n\"What, kissing her hand, and he a clergyman!\" said Miss Dunstable.\n\"I did not think they ever did such things, Mr. Robarts.\"\n\n\"Still waters run deepest,\" said Mrs. Harold Smith.\n\n\"Hush-h-h,\" looked, rather than spoke, Mrs. Proudie. \"The grief\nof spirit which that bad man caused me nearly broke my heart, and\nall the while, you know, he was courting--\" and then Mrs. Proudie\nwhispered a name.\n\n\"What, the dean's wife!\" shouted Miss Dunstable, in a voice which\nmade the coachman of the next carriage give a chuck to his horses as\nhe overheard her.\n\n\"The archdeacon's sister-in-law!\" screamed Mrs. Harold Smith.\n\n\"What might he not have attempted next?\" said Miss Dunstable.\n\n\"She wasn't the dean's wife then, you know,\" said Mrs. Proudie,\nexplaining.\n\n\"Well, you've a gay set in the chapter, I must say,\" said Miss\nDunstable. \"You ought to make one of them in Barchester, Mr.\nRobarts.\"\n\n\"Only perhaps Mrs. Robarts might not like it,\" said Mrs. Harold\nSmith.\n\n\"And then the schemes which he tried on with the bishop!\" said Mrs.\nProudie.\n\n\"It's all fair in love and war, you know,\" said Miss Dunstable.\n\n\"But he little knew whom he had to deal with when he began that,\"\nsaid Mrs. Proudie.\n\n\"The bishop was too many for him,\" suggested Mrs. Harold Smith, very\nmaliciously.\n\n\"If the bishop was not, somebody else was; and he was obliged to\nleave Barchester in utter disgrace. He has since married the wife of\nsome tallow-chandler.\"\n\n\"The wife!\" said Miss Dunstable. \"What a man!\"\n\n\"Widow, I mean; but it's all one to him.\"\n\n\"The gentleman was clearly born when Venus was in the ascendant,\"\nsaid Mrs. Smith. \"You clergymen usually are, I believe, Mr. Robarts.\"\nSo that Mrs. Proudie's carriage was by no means the dullest as they\ndrove into Barchester that day; and by degrees our friend Mark became\naccustomed to his companions, and before they reached the palace he\nacknowledged to himself that Miss Dunstable was very good fun.\n\nWe cannot linger over the bishop's dinner, though it was very good of\nits kind; and as Mr. Sowerby contrived to sit next to Miss Dunstable,\nthereby overturning a little scheme made by Mr. Supplehouse, he again\nshone forth in unclouded good humour. But Mr. Harold Smith became\nimpatient immediately on the withdrawal of the cloth. The lecture was\nto begin at seven, and according to his watch that hour had already\ncome. He declared that Sowerby and Supplehouse were endeavouring to\ndelay matters in order that the Barchesterians might become vexed\nand impatient; and so the bishop was not allowed to exercise his\nhospitality in true episcopal fashion.\n\n\"You forget, Sowerby,\" said Supplehouse, \"that the world here for the\nlast fortnight has been looking forward to nothing else.\"\n\n\"The world shall be gratified at once,\" said Mrs. Harold, obeying a\nlittle nod from Mrs. Proudie. \"Come, my dear,\" and she took hold of\nMiss Dunstable's arm, \"don't let us keep Barchester waiting. We shall\nbe ready in a quarter-of-an-hour, shall we not, Mrs. Proudie?\" and so\nthey sailed off.\n\n\"And we shall have time for one glass of claret,\" said the bishop.\n\n\"There; that's seven by the cathedral,\" said Harold Smith, jumping\nup from his chair as he heard the clock. \"If the people have come it\nwould not be right in me to keep them waiting, and I shall go.\"\n\n\"Just one glass of claret, Mr. Smith, and we'll be off,\" said the\nbishop.\n\n\"Those women will keep me an hour,\" said Harold, filling his glass,\nand drinking it standing. \"They do it on purpose.\" He was thinking\nof his wife, but it seemed to the bishop as though his guest were\nactually speaking of Mrs. Proudie.\n\nIt was rather late when they all found themselves in the big room of\nthe Mechanics' Institute; but I do not know whether this on the whole\ndid them any harm. Most of Mr. Smith's hearers, excepting the party\nfrom the palace, were Barchester tradesmen with their wives and\nfamilies; and they waited, not impatiently, for the big people. And\nthen the lecture was gratis, a fact which is always borne in mind\nby an Englishman when he comes to reckon up and calculate the way\nin which he is treated. When he pays his money, then he takes his\nchoice; he may be impatient or not as he likes. His sense of justice\nteaches him so much, and in accordance with that sense he usually\nacts.\n\nSo the people on the benches rose graciously when the palace\nparty entered the room. Seats for them had been kept in the front.\nThere were three arm-chairs, which were filled, after some little\nhesitation, by the bishop, Mrs. Proudie, and Miss Dunstable--Mrs.\nSmith positively declining to take one of them; though, as she\nadmitted, her rank as Lady Papua of the islands did give her some\nclaim. And this remark, as it was made quite out loud, reached Mr.\nSmith's ears as he stood behind a little table on a small raised\ndais, holding his white kid gloves; and it annoyed him and rather put\nhim out. He did not like that joke about Lady Papua.\n\nAnd then the others of the party sat upon a front bench covered with\nred cloth. \"We shall find this very hard and very narrow about the\nsecond hour,\" said Mr. Sowerby, and Mr. Smith on his dais again\noverheard the words, and dashed his gloves down to the table. He felt\nthat all the room would hear it.\n\nAnd there were one or two gentlemen on the second seat who shook\nhands with some of our party. There was Mr. Thorne of Ullathorne,\na good-natured old bachelor, whose residence was near enough\nto Barchester to allow of his coming in without much personal\ninconvenience; and next to him was Mr. Harding, an old clergyman\nof the chapter, with whom Mrs. Proudie shook hands very graciously,\nmaking way for him to seat himself close behind her if he would so\nplease. But Mr. Harding did not so please. Having paid his respects\nto the bishop he returned quietly to the side of his old friend Mr.\nThorne, thereby angering Mrs. Proudie, as might easily be seen by her\nface. And Mr. Chadwick also was there, the episcopal man of business\nfor the diocese; but he also adhered to the two gentlemen above\nnamed.\n\nAnd now that the bishop and the ladies had taken their places, Mr.\nHarold Smith relifted his gloves and again laid them down, hummed\nthree times distinctly, and then began.\n\n\"It was,\" he said, \"the most peculiar characteristic of the present\nera in the British islands that those who were high placed before the\nworld in rank, wealth, and education were willing to come forward\nand give their time and knowledge without fee or reward, for the\nadvantage and amelioration of those who did not stand so high in the\nsocial scale.\" And then he paused for a moment, during which Mrs.\nSmith remarked to Miss Dunstable that that was pretty well for a\nbeginning; and Miss Dunstable replied, \"that as for herself she felt\nvery grateful to rank, wealth, and education.\" Mr. Sowerby winked\nto Mr. Supplehouse, who opened his eyes very wide and shrugged his\nshoulders. But the Barchesterians took it all in good part and gave\nthe lecturer the applause of their hands and feet.\n\nAnd then, well pleased, he recommenced--\"I do not make these remarks\nwith reference to myself--\"\n\n\"I hope he's not going to be modest,\" said Miss Dunstable.\n\n\"It will be quite new if he is,\" replied Mrs. Smith.\n\n\"--so much as to many noble and talented lords and members of the\nLower House who have lately from time to time devoted themselves to\nthis good work.\" And then he went through a long list of peers and\nmembers of Parliament, beginning, of course, with Lord Boanerges, and\nending with Mr. Green Walker, a young gentleman who had lately been\nreturned by his uncle's interest for the borough of Crewe Junction,\nand had immediately made his entrance into public life by giving a\nlecture on the grammarians of the Latin language as exemplified at\nEton school.\n\n\"On the present occasion,\" Mr. Smith continued, \"our object is to\nlearn something as to those grand and magnificent islands which lie\nfar away, beyond the Indies, in the Southern Ocean; the lands of\nwhich produce rich spices and glorious fruits, and whose seas are\nimbedded with pearls and corals,--Papua and the Philippines, Borneo\nand the Moluccas. My friends, you are familiar with your maps, and\nyou know the track which the equator makes for itself through those\ndistant oceans.\" And then many heads were turned down, and there was\na rustle of leaves; for not a few of those \"who stood not so high in\nthe social scale\" had brought their maps with them, and refreshed\ntheir memories as to the whereabouts of these wondrous islands.\n\nAnd then Mr. Smith also, with a map in his hand, and pointing\noccasionally to another large map which hung against the wall, went\ninto the geography of the matter. \"We might have found that out from\nour atlases, I think, without coming all the way to Barchester,\"\nsaid that unsympathizing helpmate, Mrs. Harold, very cruelly--most\nillogically too, for there be so many things which we could find out\nourselves by search, but which we never do find out unless they be\nspecially told us; and why should not the latitude and longitude of\nLabuan be one--or rather two of these things?\n\nAnd then, when he had duly marked the path of the line through\nBorneo, Celebes, and Gilolo, through the Macassar strait and the\nMolucca passage, Mr. Harold Smith rose to a higher flight. \"But\nwhat,\" said he, \"avails all that God can give to man, unless man will\nopen his hand to receive the gift? And what is this opening of the\nhand but the process of civilization--yes, my friends, the process\nof civilization? These South Sea islanders have all that a kind\nProvidence can bestow on them; but that all is as nothing without\neducation. That education and that civilization it is for you to\nbestow upon them--yes, my friends, for you; for you, citizens of\nBarchester as you are.\" And then he paused again, in order that the\nfeet and hands might go to work. The feet and hands did go to work,\nduring which Mr. Smith took a slight drink of water.\n\nHe was now quite in his element and had got into the proper way of\npunching the table with his fists. A few words dropping from Mr.\nSowerby did now and again find their way to his ears, but the sound\nof his own voice had brought with it the accustomed charm, and he ran\non from platitude to truism, and from truism back to platitude, with\nan eloquence that was charming to himself.\n\n\"Civilization,\" he exclaimed, lifting up his eyes and hands to the\nceiling. \"Oh, civilization--\"\n\n\"There will not be a chance for us now for the next hour and a half,\"\nsaid Mr. Supplehouse, groaning.\n\nHarold Smith cast one eye down at him, but it immediately flew back\nto the ceiling.\n\n\"Oh, civilization! thou that ennoblest mankind and makest him equal\nto the gods, what is like unto thee?\" Here Mrs. Proudie showed\nevident signs of disapprobation, which no doubt would have been\nshared by the bishop, had not that worthy prelate been asleep. But\nMr. Smith continued unobservant; or, at any rate, regardless.\n\n\"What is like unto thee? Thou art the irrigating stream which makest\nfertile the barren plain. Till thou comest all is dark and dreary;\nbut at thy advent the noontide sun shines out, the earth gives forth\nher increase; the deep bowels of the rocks render up their tribute.\nForms which were dull and hideous become endowed with grace and\nbeauty, and vegetable existence rises to the scale of celestial life.\nThen, too, Genius appears clad in a panoply of translucent armour,\ngrasping in his hand the whole terrestrial surface, and making every\nrood of earth subservient to his purposes;--Genius, the child of\ncivilization, the mother of the Arts!\"\n\nThe last little bit, taken from the Pedigree of Progress, had a\ngreat success, and all Barchester went to work with its hands\nand feet;--all Barchester, except that ill-natured aristocratic\nfront-row together with the three arm-chairs at the corner of it.\nThe aristocratic front-row felt itself to be too intimate with\ncivilization to care much about it; and the three arm-chairs, or\nrather that special one which contained Mrs. Proudie, considered\nthat there was a certain heathenness, a pagan sentimentality almost\namounting to infidelity, contained in the lecturer's remarks, with\nwhich she, a pillar of the Church, could not put up, seated as she\nwas now in public conclave.\n\n\"It is to civilization that we must look,\" continued Mr. Harold\nSmith, descending from poetry to prose as a lecturer well knows how,\nand thereby showing the value of both--\"for any material progress in\nthese islands; and--\"\n\n\"And to Christianity,\" shouted Mrs. Proudie, to the great amazement\nof the assembled people and to the thorough wakening of the bishop,\nwho, jumping up in his chair at the sound of the well-known voice,\nexclaimed, \"Certainly, certainly.\"\n\n\"Hear, hear, hear,\" said those on the benches who particularly\nbelonged to Mrs. Proudie's school of divinity in the city, and among\nthe voices was distinctly heard that of a new verger in whose behalf\nshe had greatly interested herself.\n\n\"Oh, yes, Christianity of course,\" said Harold Smith, upon whom the\ninterruption did not seem to operate favourably.\n\n\"Christianity and Sabbath-day observance,\" exclaimed Mrs. Proudie,\nwho, now that she had obtained the ear of the public, seemed well\ninclined to keep it. \"Let us never forget that these islanders can\nnever prosper unless they keep the Sabbath holy.\"\n\nPoor Mr. Smith, having been so rudely dragged from his high horse,\nwas never able to mount it again, and completed the lecture in a\nmanner not at all comfortable to himself. He had there, on the table\nbefore him, a huge bundle of statistics with which he had meant to\nconvince the reason of his hearers after he had taken full possession\nof their feelings. But they fell very dull and flat. And at the\nmoment when he was interrupted he was about to explain that that\nmaterial progress to which he had alluded could not be attained\nwithout money; and that it behoved them, the people of Barchester\nbefore him, to come forward with their purses like men and brothers.\nHe did also attempt this; but from the moment of that fatal onslaught\nfrom the arm-chair, it was clear to him and to every one else, that\nMrs. Proudie was now the hero of the hour. His time had gone by, and\nthe people of Barchester did not care a straw for his appeal.\n\nFrom these causes the lecture was over full twenty minutes earlier\nthan any one had expected, to the great delight of Messrs. Sowerby\nand Supplehouse, who, on that evening, moved and carried a vote of\nthanks to Mrs. Proudie. For they had gay doings yet before they went\nto their beds.\n\n\"Robarts, here one moment,\" Mr. Sowerby said, as they were standing\nat the door of the Mechanics' Institute. \"Don't you go off with Mr.\nand Mrs. Bishop. We are going to have a little supper at the Dragon\nof Wantly, and after what we have gone through upon my word we want\nit. You can tell one of the palace servants to let you in.\"\n\nMark considered the proposal wistfully. He would fain have joined the\nsupper-party had he dared; but he, like many others of his cloth, had\nthe fear of Mrs. Proudie before his eyes.\n\nAnd a very merry supper they had; but poor Mr. Harold Smith was not\nthe merriest of the party.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nSUNDAY MORNING.\n\n\nIt was, perhaps, quite as well on the whole for Mark Robarts, that he\ndid not go to that supper party. It was eleven o'clock before they\nsat down, and nearly two before the gentlemen were in bed. It must\nbe remembered that he had to preach, on the coming Sunday morning,\na charity sermon on behalf of a mission to Mr. Harold Smith's\nislanders; and, to tell the truth, it was a task for which he had now\nvery little inclination.\n\nWhen first invited to do this, he had regarded the task seriously\nenough, as he always did regard such work, and he completed his\nsermon for the occasion before he left Framley; but, since that, an\nair of ridicule had been thrown over the whole affair, in which he\nhad joined without much thinking of his own sermon, and this made him\nnow heartily wish that he could choose a discourse upon any other\nsubject.\n\nHe knew well that the very points on which he had most insisted, were\nthose which had drawn most mirth from Miss Dunstable and Mrs. Smith,\nand had oftenest provoked his own laughter; and how was he now to\npreach on those matters in a fitting mood, knowing, as he would know,\nthat those two ladies would be looking at him, would endeavour to\ncatch his eye, and would turn him into ridicule as they had already\nturned the lecturer?\n\nIn this he did injustice to one of the ladies, unconsciously. Miss\nDunstable, with all her aptitude for mirth, and we may almost fairly\nsay for frolic, was in no way inclined to ridicule religion or\nanything which she thought to appertain to it. It may be presumed\nthat among such things she did not include Mrs. Proudie, as she was\nwilling enough to laugh at that lady; but Mark, had he known her\nbetter, might have been sure that she would have sat out his sermon\nwith perfect propriety.\n\nAs it was, however, he did feel considerable uneasiness; and in the\nmorning he got up early with the view of seeing what might be done\nin the way of emendation. He cut out those parts which referred most\nspecially to the islands,--he rejected altogether those names over\nwhich they had all laughed together so heartily,--and he inserted a\nstring of general remarks, very useful, no doubt, which he flattered\nhimself would rob his sermon of all similarity to Harold Smith's\nlecture. He had, perhaps, hoped, when writing it, to create some\nlittle sensation; but now he would be quite satisfied if it passed\nwithout remark.\n\nBut his troubles for that Sunday were destined to be many. It had\nbeen arranged that the party at the hotel should breakfast at eight,\nand start at half-past eight punctually, so as to enable them to\nreach Chaldicotes in ample time to arrange their dresses before they\nwent to church. The church stood in the grounds, close to that long\nformal avenue of lime-trees, but within the front gates. Their walk,\ntherefore, after reaching Mr. Sowerby's house, would not be long.\n\nMrs. Proudie, who was herself an early body, would not hear of her\nguest--and he a clergyman--going out to the inn for his breakfast\non a Sunday morning. As regarded that Sabbath-day journey to\nChaldicotes, to that she had given her assent, no doubt with much\nuneasiness of mind; but let them have as little desecration as\npossible. It was, therefore, an understood thing that he was to\nreturn with his friends; but he should not go without the advantage\nof family prayers and family breakfast. And so Mrs. Proudie on\nretiring to rest gave the necessary orders, to the great annoyance of\nher household.\n\nTo the great annoyance, at least, of her servants! The bishop himself\ndid not make his appearance till a much later hour. He in all things\nnow supported his wife's rule; in all things, now, I say; for\nthere had been a moment, when in the first flush and pride of his\nepiscopacy other ideas had filled his mind. Now, however, he gave no\nopposition to that good woman with whom Providence had blessed him;\nand in return for such conduct that good woman administered in all\nthings to his little personal comforts. With what surprise did the\nbishop now look back upon that unholy war which he had once been\ntempted to wage against the wife of his bosom?\n\nNor did any of the Miss Proudies show themselves at that early hour.\nThey, perhaps, were absent on a different ground. With them Mrs.\nProudie had not been so successful as with the bishop. They had\nwills of their own which became stronger and stronger every day.\nOf the three with whom Mrs. Proudie was blessed one was already in\na position to exercise that will in a legitimate way over a very\nexcellent young clergyman in the diocese, the Rev. Optimus Grey; but\nthe other two, having as yet no such opening for their powers of\ncommand, were perhaps a little too much inclined to keep themselves\nin practice at home.\n\nBut at half-past seven punctually Mrs. Proudie was there, and so was\nthe domestic chaplain; so was Mr. Robarts, and so were the household\nservants,--all excepting one lazy recreant. \"Where is Thomas?\" said\nshe of the Argus eyes, standing up with her book of family prayers in\nher hand. \"So please you, ma'am, Tummas be bad with the tooth-ache.\"\n\"Tooth-ache!\" exclaimed Mrs. Proudie; but her eyes said more terrible\nthings than that. \"Let Thomas come to me before church.\" And then\nthey proceeded to prayers. These were read by the chaplain, as it was\nproper and decent that they should be; but I cannot but think that\nMrs. Proudie a little exceeded her office in taking upon herself\nto pronounce the blessing when the prayers were over. She did it,\nhowever, in a clear, sonorous voice, and perhaps with more personal\ndignity than was within the chaplain's compass.\n\nMrs. Proudie was rather stern at breakfast, and the vicar of Framley\nfelt an unaccountable desire to get out of the house. In the first\nplace she was not dressed with her usual punctilious attention to the\nproprieties of her high situation. It was evident that there was to\nbe a further toilet before she sailed up the middle of the cathedral\nchoir. She had on a large loose cap with no other strings than those\nwhich were wanted for tying it beneath her chin, a cap with which the\nhousehold and the chaplain were well acquainted, but which seemed\nungracious in the eyes of Mr. Robarts after all the well-dressed\nholiday doings of the last week. She wore also a large, loose,\ndark-coloured wrapper, which came well up round her neck, and which\nwas not buoyed out, as were her dresses in general, with an under\nmechanism of petticoats. It clung to her closely, and added to the\ninflexibility of her general appearance. And then she had encased her\nfeet in large carpet slippers, which no doubt were comfortable, but\nwhich struck her visitor as being strange and unsightly.\n\n\"Do you find a difficulty in getting your people together for early\nmorning prayers?\" she said, as she commenced her operations with the\nteapot.\n\n\"I can't say that I do,\" said Mark. \"But then we are seldom so early\nas this.\"\n\n\"Parish clergymen should be early, I think,\" said she. \"It sets a\ngood example in the village.\"\n\n\"I am thinking of having morning prayers in the church,\" said Mr.\nRobarts.\n\n\"That's nonsense,\" said Mrs. Proudie, \"and usually means worse than\nnonsense. I know what that comes to. If you have three services on\nSunday and domestic prayers at home, you do very well.\" And so saying\nshe handed him his cup.\n\n\"But I have not three services on Sunday, Mrs. Proudie.\"\n\n\"Then I think you should have. Where can the poor people be so well\noff on Sundays as in church? The bishop intends to express a very\nstrong opinion on this subject in his next charge; and then I am sure\nyou will attend to his wishes.\"\n\nTo this Mark made no answer, but devoted himself to his egg.\n\n\"I suppose you have not a very large establishment at Framley?\" asked\nMrs. Proudie.\n\n\"What, at the parsonage?\"\n\n\"Yes; you live at the parsonage, don't you?\"\n\n\"Certainly--well; not very large, Mrs. Proudie; just enough to do the\nwork, make things comfortable, and look after the children.\"\n\n\"It is a very fine living,\" said she; \"very fine. I don't remember\nthat we have anything so good ourselves,--except it is Plumstead, the\narchdeacon's place. He has managed to butter his bread pretty well.\"\n\n\"His father was Bishop of Barchester.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I know all about him. Only for that he would barely have\nrisen to be an archdeacon, I suspect. Let me see; yours is \u00c2\u00a3800, is\nit not, Mr. Robarts? And you such a young man! I suppose you have\ninsured your life highly.\"\n\n\"Pretty well, Mrs. Proudie.\"\n\n\"And then, too, your wife had some little fortune, had she not? We\ncannot all fall on our feet like that; can we, Mr. White?\" and Mrs.\nProudie in her playful way appealed to the chaplain.\n\nMrs. Proudie was an imperious woman; but then so also was Lady\nLufton; and it may therefore be said that Mr. Robarts ought to have\nbeen accustomed to feminine domination; but as he sat there munching\nhis toast he could not but make a comparison between the two. Lady\nLufton in her little attempts sometimes angered him; but he certainly\nthought, comparing the lay lady and the clerical together, that the\nrule of the former was the lighter and the pleasanter. But then Lady\nLufton had given him a living and a wife, and Mrs. Proudie had given\nhim nothing.\n\nImmediately after breakfast Mr. Robarts escaped to the Dragon of\nWantly, partly because he had had enough of the matutinal Mrs.\nProudie, and partly also in order that he might hurry his friends\nthere. He was already becoming fidgety about the time, as Harold\nSmith had been on the preceding evening, and he did not give Mrs.\nSmith credit for much punctuality. When he arrived at the inn he\nasked if they had done breakfast, and was immediately told that not\none of them was yet down. It was already half-past eight, and they\nought to be now under weigh on the road.\n\nHe immediately went to Mr. Sowerby's room, and found that gentleman\nshaving himself. \"Don't be a bit uneasy,\" said Mr. Sowerby. \"You and\nSmith shall have my phaeton, and those horses will take you there in\nan hour. Not, however, but what we shall all be in time. We'll send\nround to the whole party and ferret them out.\" And then Mr. Sowerby,\nhaving evoked manifold aid with various peals of the bell, sent\nmessengers, male and female, flying to all the different rooms.\n\n\"I think I'll hire a gig and go over at once,\" said Mark. \"It would\nnot do for me to be late, you know.\"\n\n\"It won't do for any of us to be late; and it's all nonsense about\nhiring a gig. It would be just throwing a sovereign away, and we\nshould pass you on the road. Go down and see that the tea is made,\nand all that; and make them have the bill ready; and, Robarts, you\nmay pay it too, if you like it. But I believe we may as well leave\nthat to Baron Borneo--eh?\"\n\nAnd then Mark did go down and make the tea, and he did order the\nbill; and then he walked about the room, looking at his watch, and\nnervously waiting for the footsteps of his friends. And as he was so\nemployed, he bethought himself whether it was fit that he should be\nso doing on a Sunday morning; whether it was good that he should be\nwaiting there, in painful anxiety, to gallop over a dozen miles in\norder that he might not be too late with his sermon; whether his\nown snug room at home, with Fanny opposite to him, and his bairns\ncrawling on the floor, with his own preparations for his own quiet\nservice, and the warm pressure of Lady Lufton's hand when that\nservice should be over, was not better than all this.\n\nHe could not afford not to know Harold Smith, and Mr. Sowerby, and\nthe Duke of Omnium, he had said to himself. He had to look to rise\nin the world, as other men did. But what pleasure had come to him as\nyet from these intimacies? How much had he hitherto done towards his\nrising? To speak the truth he was not over well pleased with himself,\nas he made Mrs. Harold Smith's tea and ordered Mr. Sowerby's\nmutton-chops on that Sunday morning.\n\nAt a little after nine they all assembled; but even then he could\nnot make the ladies understand that there was any cause for hurry;\nat least Mrs. Smith, who was the leader of the party, would not\nunderstand it. When Mark again talked of hiring a gig, Miss Dunstable\nindeed said that she would join him; and seemed to be so far earnest\nin the matter that Mr. Sowerby hurried through his second egg in\norder to prevent such a catastrophe. And then Mark absolutely did\norder the gig; whereupon Mrs. Smith remarked that in such case she\nneed not hurry herself; but the waiter brought up word that all\nthe horses of the hotel were out, excepting one pair, neither of\nwhich could go in single harness. Indeed, half of their stable\nestablishment was already secured by Mr. Sowerby's own party.\n\n\"Then let me have the pair,\" said Mark, almost frantic with delay.\n\n\"Nonsense, Robarts; we are ready now. He won't want them, James.\nCome, Supplehouse, have you done?\"\n\n\"Then I am to hurry myself, am I?\" said Mrs. Harold Smith. \"What\nchangeable creatures you men are! May I be allowed half a cup more\ntea, Mr. Robarts?\"\n\nMark, who was now really angry, turned away to the window. There\nwas no charity in these people, he said to himself. They knew the\nnature of his distress, and yet they only laughed at him. He did not,\nperhaps, reflect that he had assisted in the joke against Harold\nSmith on the previous evening.\n\n\"James,\" said he, turning to the waiter, \"let me have that pair of\nhorses immediately, if you please.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; round in fifteen minutes, sir: only Ned, sir, the\npost-boy, sir; I fear he's at his breakfast, sir; but we'll have him\nhere in less than no time, sir!\"\n\nBut before Ned and the pair were there, Mrs. Smith had absolutely got\nher bonnet on, and at ten they started. Mark did share the phaeton\nwith Harold Smith, but the phaeton did not go any faster than the\nother carriages. They led the way, indeed, but that was all; and when\nthe vicar's watch told him that it was eleven, they were still a\nmile from Chaldicotes' gate, although the horses were in a lather of\nsteam; and they had only just entered the village when the church\nbells ceased to be heard.\n\n\"Come, you are in time, after all,\" said Harold Smith. \"Better time\nthan I was last night.\" Robarts could not explain to him that the\nentry of a clergyman into church, of a clergyman who is going to\nassist in the service, should not be made at the last minute, that it\nshould be staid and decorous, and not done in scrambling haste, with\nrunning feet and scant breath.\n\n\"I suppose we'll stop here, sir,\" said the postilion, as he pulled\nup his horses short at the church-door, in the midst of the people\nwho were congregated together ready for the service. But Mark had not\nanticipated being so late, and said at first that it was necessary\nthat he should go on to the house; then, when the horses had again\nbegun to move, he remembered that he could send for his gown, and\nas he got out of the carriage he gave his orders accordingly. And\nnow the other two carriages were there, and so there was a noise\nand confusion at the door--very unseemly, as Mark felt it; and the\ngentlemen spoke in loud voices, and Mrs. Harold Smith declared\nthat she had no prayer-book, and was much too tired to go in at\npresent;--she would go home and rest herself, she said. And two\nother ladies of the party did so also, leaving Miss Dunstable to go\nalone;--for which, however, she did not care one button. And then one\nof the party, who had a nasty habit of swearing, cursed at something\nas he walked in close to Mark's elbow; and so they made their way up\nthe church as the absolution was being read, and Mark Robarts felt\nthoroughly ashamed of himself. If his rising in the world brought him\nin contact with such things as these, would it not be better for him\nthat he should do without rising?\n\nHis sermon went off without any special notice. Mrs. Harold Smith was\nnot there, much to his satisfaction; and the others who were did not\nseem to pay any special attention to it. The subject had lost its\nnovelty, except with the ordinary church congregation, the farmers\nand labourers of the parish; and the \"quality\" in the squire's great\npew were content to show their sympathy by a moderate subscription.\nMiss Dunstable, however, gave a ten-pound note, which swelled up the\nsum total to a respectable amount--for such a place as Chaldicotes.\n\n\"And now I hope I may never hear another word about New Guinea,\" said\nMr. Sowerby, as they all clustered round the drawing-room fire after\nchurch. \"That subject may be regarded as having been killed and\nburied; eh, Harold?\"\n\n\"Certainly murdered last night,\" said Mrs. Harold, \"by that awful\nwoman, Mrs. Proudie.\"\n\n\"I wonder you did not make a dash at her and pull her out of the\narm-chair,\" said Miss Dunstable. \"I was expecting it, and thought\nthat I should come to grief in the scrimmage.\"\n\n\"I never knew a lady do such a brazen-faced thing before,\" said Miss\nKerrigy, a travelling friend of Miss Dunstable's.\n\n\"Nor I--never; in a public place, too,\" said Dr. Easyman, a medical\ngentleman, who also often accompanied her.\n\n\"As for brass,\" said Mr. Supplehouse, \"she would never stop at\nanything for want of that. It is well that she has enough, for the\npoor bishop is but badly provided.\"\n\n\"I hardly heard what it was she did say,\" said Harold Smith; \"so I\ncould not answer her, you know. Something about Sundays, I believe.\"\n\n\"She hoped you would not put the South Sea islanders up to Sabbath\ntravelling,\" said Mr. Sowerby.\n\n\"And specially begged that you would establish Lord's-day schools,\"\nsaid Mrs. Smith; and then they all went to work and picked Mrs.\nProudie to pieces from the top ribbon of her cap down to the sole of\nher slipper.\n\n\"And then she expects the poor parsons to fall in love with her\ndaughters. That's the hardest thing of all,\" said Miss Dunstable.\n\nBut, on the whole, when our vicar went to bed he did not feel that he\nhad spent a profitable Sunday.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nGATHERUM CASTLE.\n\n\nOn the Tuesday morning Mark did receive his wife's letter and the\nten-pound note, whereby a strong proof was given of the honesty of\nthe post-office people in Barsetshire. That letter, written as it had\nbeen in a hurry, while Robin post-boy was drinking a single mug of\nbeer,--well, what of it if it was half filled a second time?--was\nnevertheless eloquent of his wife's love and of her great triumph.\n\n\n   I have only half a moment to send you the money [she\n   said], for the postman is here waiting. When I see you\n   I'll explain why I am so hurried. Let me know that you\n   get it safe. It is all right now, and Lady Lufton was\n   here not a minute ago. She did not quite like it; about\n   Gatherum Castle I mean; but you'll hear _nothing about\n   it_. Only remember that _you must dine_ at Framley Court\n   on Wednesday week. _I have promised for you._ You will:\n   won't you, dearest? I shall come and fetch you away if you\n   attempt to stay longer than you have said. But I'm sure\n   you won't. God bless you, my own one! Mr. Jones gave\n   us the same sermon he preached the second Sunday after\n   Easter. Twice in the same year is too often. God bless\n   you! The children _are quite well_. Mark sends a big\n   kiss.--Your own F.\n\n\nRobarts, as he read this letter and crumpled the note up into his\npocket, felt that it was much more satisfactory than he deserved. He\nknew that there must have been a fight, and that his wife, fighting\nloyally on his behalf, had got the best of it; and he knew also that\nher victory had not been owing to the goodness of her cause. He\nfrequently declared to himself that he would not be afraid of Lady\nLufton; but nevertheless these tidings that no reproaches were to be\nmade to him afforded him great relief.\n\nOn the following Friday they all went to the duke's, and found that\nthe bishop and Mrs. Proudie were there before them; as were also\nsundry other people, mostly of some note, either in the estimation of\nthe world at large or of that of West Barsetshire. Lord Boanerges was\nthere, an old man who would have his own way in everything, and who\nwas regarded by all men--apparently even by the duke himself--as\nan intellectual king, by no means of the constitutional kind,--as\nan intellectual emperor, rather, who took upon himself to rule all\nquestions of mind without the assistance of any ministers whatever.\nAnd Baron Brawl was of the party, one of her Majesty's puisne judges,\nas jovial a guest as ever entered a country house; but given to be\nrather sharp withal in his jovialities. And there was Mr. Green\nWalker, a young but rising man, the same who lectured not long since\non a popular subject to his constituents at the Crewe Junction. Mr.\nGreen Walker was a nephew of the Marchioness of Hartletop, and the\nMarchioness of Hartletop was a friend of the Duke of Omnium's. Mr.\nMark Robarts was certainly elated when he ascertained who composed\nthe company of which he had been so earnestly pressed to make a\nportion. Would it have been wise in him to forego this on account of\nthe prejudices of Lady Lufton?\n\nAs the guests were so many and so great, the huge front portals of\nGatherum Castle were thrown open, and the vast hall, adorned with\ntrophies--with marble busts from Italy and armour from Wardour\nStreet,--was thronged with gentlemen and ladies, and gave forth\nunwonted echoes to many a footstep. His grace himself, when Mark\narrived there with Sowerby and Miss Dunstable--for in this instance\nMiss Dunstable did travel in the phaeton while Mark occupied a\nseat in the dicky--his grace himself was at this moment in the\ndrawing-room, and nothing could exceed his urbanity.\n\n\"Oh, Miss Dunstable,\" he said, taking that lady by the hand, and\nleading her up to the fire, \"now I feel for the first time that\nGatherum Castle has not been built for nothing.\"\n\n\"Nobody ever supposed it was, your grace,\" said Miss Dunstable. \"I am\nsure the architect did not think so when his bill was paid.\" And Miss\nDunstable put her toes up on the fender to warm them with as much\nself-possession as though her father had been a duke also, instead of\na quack doctor.\n\n\"We have given the strictest orders about the parrot,\" said the\nduke--\n\n\"Ah! but I have not brought him after all,\" said Miss Dunstable.\n\n--\"and I have had an aviary built on purpose,--just such as parrots\nare used to in their own country. Well, Miss Dunstable, I do call\nthat unkind. Is it too late to send for him?\"\n\n\"He and Dr. Easyman are travelling together. The truth was, I could\nnot rob the doctor of his companion.\"\n\n\"Why? I have had another aviary built for him. I declare, Miss\nDunstable, the honour you are doing me is shorn of half its glory.\nBut the poodle--I still trust in the poodle.\"\n\n\"And your grace's trust shall not in that respect be in vain. Where\nis he, I wonder?\" And Miss Dunstable looked round as though she\nexpected that somebody would certainly have brought her dog in after\nher. \"I declare I must go and look for him,--only think if they\nwere to put him among your grace's dogs,--how his morals would be\ndestroyed!\"\n\n\"Miss Dunstable, is that intended to be personal?\" But the lady had\nturned away from the fire, and the duke was able to welcome his other\nguests.\n\nThis he did with much courtesy. \"Sowerby,\" he said, \"I am glad to\nfind that you have survived the lecture. I can assure you I had fears\nfor you.\"\n\n\"I was brought back to life after considerable delay by the\nadministration of tonics at the Dragon of Wantly. Will your grace\nallow me to present to you Mr. Robarts, who on that occasion was not\nso fortunate. It was found necessary to carry him off to the palace,\nwhere he was obliged to undergo very vigorous treatment.\"\n\nAnd then the duke shook hands with Mr. Robarts, assuring him that he\nwas most happy to make his acquaintance. He had often heard of him\nsince he came into the county; and then he asked after Lord Lufton,\nregretting that he had been unable to induce his lordship to come to\nGatherum Castle.\n\n\"But you had a diversion at the lecture, I am told,\" continued the\nduke. \"There was a second performer, was there not, who almost\neclipsed poor Harold Smith?\" And then Mr. Sowerby gave an amusing\nsketch of the little Proudie episode.\n\n\"It has, of course, ruined your brother-in-law for ever as a\nlecturer,\" said the duke, laughing.\n\n\"If so, we shall feel ourselves under the deepest obligations to Mrs.\nProudie,\" said Mr. Sowerby. And then Harold Smith himself came up and\nreceived the duke's sincere and hearty congratulations on the success\nof his enterprise at Barchester.\n\nMark Robarts had now turned away, and his attention was suddenly\narrested by the loud voice of Miss Dunstable, who had stumbled across\nsome very dear friends in her passage through the rooms, and who by\nno means hid from the public her delight upon the occasion.\n\n\"Well--well--well!\" she exclaimed, and then she seized upon a very\nquiet-looking, well-dressed, attractive young woman who was walking\ntowards her, in company with a gentleman. The gentleman and lady, as\nit turned out, were husband and wife. \"Well--well--well! I hardly\nhoped for this.\" And then she took hold of the lady and kissed her\nenthusiastically, and after that grasped both the gentleman's hands,\nshaking them stoutly.\n\n\"And what a deal I shall have to say to you!\" she went on. \"You'll\nupset all my other plans. But, Mary, my dear, how long are you going\nto stay here? I go--let me see--I forget when, but it's all put down\nin a book upstairs. But the next stage is at Mrs. Proudie's. I shan't\nmeet you there, I suppose. And now, Frank, how's the governor?\"\n\nThe gentleman called Frank declared that the governor was all\nright--\"mad about the hounds, of course, you know.\"\n\n\"Well, my dear, that's better than the hounds being mad about him,\nlike the poor gentleman they've put into a statue. But talking of\nhounds, Frank, how badly they manage their foxes at Chaldicotes!\nI was out hunting all one day--\"\n\n\"You out hunting!\" said the lady called Mary.\n\n\"And why shouldn't I go out hunting? I'll tell you what, Mrs. Proudie\nwas out hunting, too. But they didn't catch a single fox; and, if you\nmust have the truth, it seemed to me to be rather slow.\"\n\n\"You were in the wrong division of the county,\" said the gentleman\ncalled Frank.\n\n\"Of course I was. When I really want to practise hunting I'll go to\nGreshamsbury; not a doubt about that.\"\n\n\"Or to Boxall Hill,\" said the lady; \"you'll find quite as much zeal\nthere as at Greshamsbury.\"\n\n\"And more discretion, you should add,\" said the gentleman.\n\n\"Ha! ha! ha!\" laughed Miss Dunstable; \"your discretion indeed! But\nyou have not told me a word about Lady Arabella.\"\n\n\"My mother is quite well,\" said the gentleman.\n\n\"And the doctor? By-the-by, my dear, I've had such a letter from the\ndoctor; only two days ago. I'll show it you upstairs to-morrow. But\nmind, it must be a positive secret. If he goes on in this way he'll\nget himself into the Tower, or Coventry, or a blue-book, or some\ndreadful place.\"\n\n\"Why; what has he said?\"\n\n\"Never you mind, Master Frank: I don't mean to show you the letter,\nyou may be sure of that. But if your wife will swear three times on\na poker and tongs that she won't reveal, I'll show it to her. And so\nyou are quite settled at Boxall Hill, are you?\"\n\n\"Frank's horses are settled; and the dogs nearly so,\" said Frank's\nwife; \"but I can't boast much of anything else yet.\"\n\n\"Well, there's a good time coming. I must go and change my things\nnow. But, Mary, mind you get near me this evening; I have such a deal\nto say to you.\" And then Miss Dunstable marched out of the room.\n\nAll this had been said in so loud a voice that it was, as a matter\nof course, overheard by Mark Robarts--that part of the conversation\nof course I mean which had come from Miss Dunstable. And then Mark\nlearned that this was young Frank Gresham of Boxall Hill, son of\nold Mr. Gresham of Greshamsbury. Frank had lately married a great\nheiress; a greater heiress, men said, even than Miss Dunstable;\nand as the marriage was hardly as yet more than six months old the\nBarsetshire world was still full of it.\n\n\"The two heiresses seem to be very loving, don't they?\" said Mr.\nSupplehouse. \"Birds of a feather flock together, you know. But they\ndid say some little time ago that young Gresham was to have married\nMiss Dunstable himself.\"\n\n\"Miss Dunstable! why she might almost be his mother,\" said Mark.\n\n\"That makes but little difference. He was obliged to marry money, and\nI believe there is no doubt that he did at one time propose to Miss\nDunstable.\"\n\n\"I have had a letter from Lufton,\" Mr. Sowerby said to him the next\nmorning. \"He declares that the delay was all your fault. You were to\nhave told Lady Lufton before he did anything, and he was waiting to\nwrite about it till he heard from you. It seems that you never said a\nword to her ladyship on the subject.\"\n\n\"I never did, certainly. My commission from Lufton was to break the\nmatter to her when I found her in a proper humour for receiving it.\nIf you knew Lady Lufton as well as I do, you would know that it is\nnot every day that she would be in a humour for such tidings.\"\n\n\"And so I was to be kept waiting indefinitely because you two between\nyou were afraid of an old woman! However I have not a word to say\nagainst her, and the matter is settled now.\"\n\n\"Has the farm been sold?\"\n\n\"Not a bit of it. The dowager could not bring her mind to suffer\nsuch profanation for the Lufton acres, and so she sold five\nthousand pounds out of the funds and sent the money to Lufton as a\npresent;--sent it to him without saying a word, only hoping that it\nwould suffice for his wants. I wish I had a mother, I know.\"\n\nMark found it impossible at the moment to make any remark upon what\nhad been told him, but he felt a sudden qualm of conscience and a\nwish that he was at Framley instead of at Gatherum Castle at the\npresent moment. He knew a good deal respecting Lady Lufton's income\nand the manner in which it was spent. It was very handsome for a\nsingle lady, but then she lived in a free and open-handed style; her\ncharities were noble; there was no reason why she should save money,\nand her annual income was usually spent within the year. Mark knew\nthis, and he knew also that nothing short of an impossibility to\nmaintain them would induce her to lessen her charities. She had now\ngiven away a portion of her principal to save the property of her\nson--her son, who was so much more opulent than herself,--upon whose\nmeans, too, the world made fewer effectual claims.\n\nAnd Mark knew, too, something of the purpose for which this money had\ngone. There had been unsettled gambling claims between Sowerby and\nLord Lufton, originating in affairs of the turf. It had now been\ngoing on for four years, almost from the period when Lord Lufton had\nbecome of age. He had before now spoken to Robarts on the matter\nwith much bitter anger, alleging that Mr. Sowerby was treating him\nunfairly, nay, dishonestly--that he was claiming money that was not\ndue to him; and then he declared more than once that he would bring\nthe matter before the Jockey Club. But Mark, knowing that Lord Lufton\nwas not clear-sighted in these matters, and believing it to be\nimpossible that Mr. Sowerby should actually endeavour to defraud his\nfriend, had smoothed down the young lord's anger, and recommended\nhim to get the case referred to some private arbiter. All this had\nafterwards been discussed between Robarts and Mr. Sowerby himself,\nand hence had originated their intimacy. The matter was so referred,\nMr. Sowerby naming the referee; and Lord Lufton, when the matter was\ngiven against him, took it easily. His anger was over by that time.\n\"I've been clean done among them,\" he said to Mark, laughing; \"but\nit does not signify; a man must pay for his experience. Of course,\nSowerby thinks it all right; I am bound to suppose so.\" And then\nthere had been some further delay as to the amount, and part of the\nmoney had been paid to a third person, and a bill had been given, and\nheaven and the Jews only know how much money Lord Lufton had paid\nin all; and now it was ended by his handing over to some wretched\nvillain of a money-dealer, on behalf of Mr. Sowerby, the enormous sum\nof five thousand pounds, which had been deducted from the means of\nhis mother, Lady Lufton!\n\nMark, as he thought of all this, could not but feel a certain\nanimosity against Mr. Sowerby--could not but suspect that he was a\nbad man. Nay, must he not have known that he was very bad? And yet he\ncontinued walking with him through the duke's grounds, still talking\nabout Lord Lufton's affairs, and still listening with interest to\nwhat Sowerby told him of his own.\n\n\"No man was ever robbed as I have been,\" said he. \"But I shall win\nthrough yet, in spite of them all. But those Jews, Mark\"--he had\nbecome very intimate with him in these latter days--\"whatever you do,\nkeep clear of them. Why, I could paper a room with their signatures;\nand yet I never had a claim upon one of them, though they always have\nclaims on me!\"\n\nI have said above that this affair of Lord Lufton's was ended; but\nit now appeared to Mark that it was not _quite_ ended. \"Tell Lufton,\nyou know,\" said Sowerby, \"that every bit of paper with his name has\nbeen taken up, except what that ruffian Tozer has. Tozer may have\none bill, I believe,--something that was not given up when it was\nrenewed. But I'll make my lawyer Gumption get that up. It may cost\nten pounds or twenty pounds, not more. You'll remember that when you\nsee Lufton, will you?\"\n\n\"You'll see Lufton in all probability before I shall.\"\n\n\"Oh, did I not tell you? He's going to Framley Court at once; you'll\nfind him there when you return.\"\n\n\"Find him at Framley!\"\n\n\"Yes; this little _cadeau_ from his mother has touched his filial\nheart. He is rushing home to Framley to pay back the dowager's hard\nmoidores in soft caresses. I wish I had a mother; I know that.\"\n\nAnd Mark still felt that he feared Mr. Sowerby, but he could not make\nup his mind to break away from him.\n\nAnd there was much talk of politics just then at the castle. Not that\nthe duke joined in it with any enthusiasm. He was a Whig--a huge\nmountain of a colossal Whig--all the world knew that. No opponent\nwould have dreamed of tampering with his whiggery, nor would any\nbrother Whig have dreamed of doubting it. But he was a Whig who gave\nvery little practical support to any set of men, and very little\npractical opposition to any other set. He was above troubling himself\nwith such sublunar matters. At election time he supported, and always\ncarried, Whig candidates; and in return he had been appointed lord\nlieutenant of the county by one Whig minister, and had received the\nGarter from another. But these things were matters of course to a\nDuke of Omnium. He was born to be a lord lieutenant and a knight of\nthe Garter.\n\nBut not the less on account of his apathy, or rather quiescence,\nwas it thought that Gatherum Castle was a fitting place in which\npoliticians might express to each other their present hopes and\nfuture aims, and concoct together little plots in a half-serious\nand half-mocking way. Indeed it was hinted that Mr. Supplehouse and\nHarold Smith, with one or two others, were at Gatherum for this\nexpress purpose. Mr. Fothergill, too, was a noted politician, and\nwas supposed to know the duke's mind well; and Mr. Green Walker, the\nnephew of the marchioness, was a young man whom the duke desired to\nhave brought forward. Mr. Sowerby also was the duke's own member, and\nso the occasion suited well for the interchange of a few ideas.\n\nThe then prime minister, angry as many men were with him, had not\nbeen altogether unsuccessful. He had brought the Russian war to a\nclose, which, if not glorious, was at any rate much more so than\nEnglishmen at one time had ventured to hope. And he had had wonderful\nluck in that Indian mutiny. It is true that many of those even who\nvoted with him would declare that this was in no way attributable\nto him. Great men had risen in India and done all that. Even his\nminister there, the governor whom he had sent out, was not allowed\nin those days any credit for the success which was achieved under\nhis orders. There was great reason to doubt the man at the helm. But\nnevertheless he had been lucky. There is no merit in a public man\nlike success!\n\nBut now, when the evil days were well nigh over, came the question\nwhether he had not been too successful. When a man has nailed fortune\nto his chariot-wheels he is apt to travel about in rather a proud\nfashion. There are servants who think that their masters cannot do\nwithout them; and the public also may occasionally have some such\nservant. What if this too successful minister were one of them!\n\nAnd then a discreet, commonplace, zealous member of the Lower\nHouse does not like to be jeered at, when he does his duty by his\nconstituents and asks a few questions. An all-successful minister who\ncannot keep his triumph to himself, but must needs drive about in a\nproud fashion, laughing at commonplace zealous members--laughing even\noccasionally at members who are by no means commonplace, which is\noutrageous!--may it not be as well to ostracize him for awhile?\n\n\"Had we not better throw in our shells against him?\" says Mr. Harold\nSmith.\n\n\"Let us throw in our shells, by all means,\" says Mr. Supplehouse,\nmindful as Juno of his despised charms. And when Mr. Supplehouse\ndeclares himself an enemy, men know how much it means. They know that\nthat much-belaboured head of affairs must succumb to the terrible\nblows which are now in store for him. \"Yes, we will throw in our\nshells.\" And Mr. Supplehouse rises from his chair with gleaming\neyes. \"Has not Greece as noble sons as him? ay, and much nobler,\ntraitor that he is. We must judge a man by his friends,\" says Mr.\nSupplehouse; and he points away to the East, where our dear allies\nthe French are supposed to live, and where our head of affairs is\nsupposed to have too close an intimacy.\n\nThey all understand this, even Mr. Green Walker. \"I don't know that\nhe is any good to any of us at all, now,\" says the talented member\nfor the Crewe Junction. \"He's a great deal too uppish to suit my\nbook; and I know a great many people that think so too. There's my\nuncle--\"\n\n\"He's the best fellow in the world,\" said Mr. Fothergill, who felt,\nperhaps, that that coming revelation about Mr. Green Walker's uncle\nmight not be of use to them; \"but the fact is one gets tired of the\nsame man always. One does not like partridge every day. As for me, I\nhave nothing to do with it myself; but I would certainly like to\nchange the dish.\"\n\n\"If we're merely to do as we are bid, and have no voice of our own,\nI don't see what's the good of going to the shop at all,\" said Mr.\nSowerby.\n\n\"Not the least use,\" said Mr. Supplehouse. \"We are false to our\nconstituents in submitting to such a dominion.\"\n\n\"Let's have a change, then,\" said Mr. Sowerby. \"The matter's pretty\nmuch in our own hands.\"\n\n\"Altogether,\" said Mr. Green Walker. \"That's what my uncle always\nsays.\"\n\n\"The Manchester men will only be too happy for the chance,\" said\nHarold Smith.\n\n\"And as for the high and dry gentlemen,\" said Mr. Sowerby, \"it's not\nvery likely that they will object to pick up the fruit when we shake\nthe tree.\"\n\n\"As to picking up the fruit, that's as may be,\" said Mr. Supplehouse.\nWas he not the man to save the nation; and if so, why should he not\npick up the fruit himself? Had not the greatest power in the country\npointed him out as such a saviour? What though the country at the\npresent moment needed no more saving, might there not, nevertheless,\nbe a good time coming? Were there not rumours of other wars still\nprevalent--if indeed the actual war then going on was being brought\nto a close without his assistance by some other species of salvation?\nHe thought of that country to which he had pointed, and of that\nfriend of his enemies, and remembered that there might be still work\nfor a mighty saviour. The public mind was now awake, and understood\nwhat it was about. When a man gets into his head an idea that the\npublic voice calls for him, it is astonishing how great becomes his\ntrust in the wisdom of the public. _Vox populi vox Dei._ \"Has it not\nbeen so always?\" he says to himself, as he gets up and as he goes to\nbed. And then Mr. Supplehouse felt that he was the master mind there\nat Gatherum Castle, and that those there were all puppets in his\nhand. It is such a pleasant thing to feel that one's friends are\npuppets, and that the strings are in one's own possession. But what\nif Mr. Supplehouse himself were a puppet?\n\nSome months afterwards, when the much-belaboured head of affairs\nwas in very truth made to retire, when unkind shells were thrown in\nagainst him in great numbers, when he exclaimed, \"_Et tu, Brute!_\"\ntill the words were stereotyped upon his lips, all men in all places\ntalked much about the great Gatherum Castle confederation. The Duke\nof Omnium, the world said, had taken into his high consideration the\nstate of affairs, and seeing with his eagle's eye that the welfare\nof his countrymen at large required that some great step should be\ninitiated, he had at once summoned to his mansion many members of the\nLower House, and some also of the House of Lords,--mention was here\nespecially made of the all-venerable and all-wise Lord Boanerges; and\nmen went on to say that there, in deep conclave, he had made known\nto them his views. It was thus agreed that the head of affairs, Whig\nas he was, must fall. The country required it, and the duke did his\nduty. This was the beginning, the world said, of that celebrated\nconfederation, by which the ministry was overturned, and--as the\n_Goody Twoshoes_ added,--the country saved. But the _Jupiter_ took\nall the credit to itself; and the _Jupiter_ was not far wrong. All\nthe credit was due to the _Jupiter_--in that, as in everything else.\n\nIn the meantime the Duke of Omnium entertained his guests in\nthe quiet princely style, but did not condescend to have much\nconversation on politics either with Mr. Supplehouse or with Mr.\nHarold Smith. And as for Lord Boanerges, he spent the morning on\nwhich the above-described conversation took place in teaching Miss\nDunstable to blow soap-bubbles on scientific principles.\n\n\"Dear, dear!\" said Miss Dunstable, as sparks of knowledge came\nflying in upon her mind. \"I always thought that a soap-bubble was a\nsoap-bubble, and I never asked the reason why. One doesn't, you know,\nmy lord.\"\n\n\"Pardon me, Miss Dunstable,\" said the old lord, \"one does; but nine\nhundred and ninety-nine do not.\"\n\n\"And the nine hundred and ninety-nine have the best of it,\" said Miss\nDunstable. \"What pleasure can one have in a ghost after one has seen\nthe phosphorus rubbed on?\"\n\n\"Quite true, my dear lady. 'If ignorance be bliss, 'tis folly to be\nwise.' It all lies in the 'if.'\"\n\nThen Miss Dunstable began to sing:--\n\n   \"'What tho' I trace each herb and flower\n     That sips the morning dew--'\n\n--you know the rest, my lord.\"\n\nLord Boanerges did know almost everything, but he did not know that;\nand so Miss Dunstable went on:--\n\n   \"'Did I not own Jehovah's power\n     How vain were all I knew.'\"\n\n\"Exactly, exactly, Miss Dunstable,\" said his lordship; \"but why not\nown the power and trace the flower as well? perhaps one might help\nthe other.\"\n\nUpon the whole I am afraid that Lord Boanerges got the best of it.\nBut then that is his line. He has been getting the best of it all his\nlife.\n\nIt was observed by all that the duke was especially attentive to\nyoung Mr. Frank Gresham, the gentleman on whom and on whose wife Miss\nDunstable had seized so vehemently. This Mr. Gresham was the richest\ncommoner in the county, and it was rumoured that at the next election\nhe would be one of the members for the East Riding. Now the duke had\nlittle or nothing to do with the East Riding, and it was well known\nthat young Gresham would be brought forward as a strong conservative.\nBut, nevertheless, his acres were so extensive and his money so\nplentiful that he was worth a duke's notice. Mr. Sowerby also was\nalmost more than civil to him, as was natural, seeing that this very\nyoung man by a mere scratch of his pen could turn a scrap of paper\ninto a bank-note of almost fabulous value.\n\n\"So you have the East Barsetshire hounds at Boxall Hill; have you\nnot?\" said the duke.\n\n\"The hounds are there,\" said Frank. \"But I am not the master.\"\n\n\"Oh! I understood--\"\n\n\"My father has them. But he finds Boxall Hill more centrical than\nGreshamsbury. The dogs and horses have to go shorter distances.\"\n\n\"Boxall Hill is very centrical.\"\n\n\"Oh, exactly!\"\n\n\"And your young gorse coverts are doing well?\"\n\n\"Pretty well--gorse won't thrive everywhere, I find. I wish it\nwould.\"\n\n\"That's just what I say to Fothergill; and then where there's much\nwoodland you can't get the vermin to leave it.\"\n\n\"But we haven't a tree at Boxall Hill,\" said Mrs. Gresham.\n\n\"Ah, yes; you're new there, certainly; you've enough of it at\nGreshamsbury in all conscience. There's a larger extent of wood there\nthan we have; isn't there, Fothergill?\"\n\nMr. Fothergill said that the Greshamsbury woods were very extensive,\nbut that, perhaps, he thought--\n\n\"Oh, ah! I know,\" said the duke. \"The Black Forest in its old days\nwas nothing to Gatherum woods, according to Fothergill. And then\nagain, nothing in East Barsetshire could be equal to anything in West\nBarsetshire. Isn't that it; eh, Fothergill?\"\n\nMr. Fothergill professed that he had been brought up in that faith\nand intended to die in it.\n\n\"Your exotics at Boxall Hill are very fine, magnificent!\" said Mr.\nSowerby.\n\n\"I'd sooner have one full-grown oak standing in its pride alone,\"\nsaid young Gresham, rather grandiloquently, \"than all the exotics in\nthe world.\"\n\n\"They'll come in due time,\" said the duke.\n\n\"But the due time won't be in my days. And so they're going to cut\ndown Chaldicotes forest, are they, Mr. Sowerby?\"\n\n\"Well, I can't tell you that. They are going to disforest it. I have\nbeen ranger since I was twenty-two, and I don't yet know whether that\nmeans cutting down.\"\n\n\"Not only cutting down, but rooting up,\" said Mr. Fothergill.\n\n\"It's a murderous shame,\" said Frank Gresham; \"and I will say one\nthing, I don't think any but a Whig government would do it.\"\n\n\"Ha, ha, ha!\" laughed his grace. \"At any rate I'm sure of this,\" he\nsaid, \"that if a conservative government did do so, the Whigs would\nbe just as indignant as you are now.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what you ought to do, Mr. Gresham,\" said Sowerby: \"put\nin an offer for the whole of the West Barsetshire crown property;\nthey will be very glad to sell it.\"\n\n\"And we should be delighted to welcome you on this side of the\nborder,\" said the duke.\n\nYoung Gresham did feel rather flattered. There were not many men in\nthe county to whom such an offer could be made without an absurdity.\nIt might be doubted whether the duke himself could purchase the Chace\nof Chaldicotes with ready money; but that he, Gresham, could do\nso--he and his wife between them--no man did doubt. And then Mr.\nGresham thought of a former day when he had once been at Gatherum\nCastle. He had been poor enough then, and the duke had not treated\nhim in the most courteous manner in the world. How hard it is for\na rich man not to lean upon his riches! harder, indeed, than for a\ncamel to go through the eye of a needle.\n\nAll Barsetshire knew--at any rate all West Barsetshire--that Miss\nDunstable had been brought down in those parts in order that Mr.\nSowerby might marry her. It was not surmised that Miss Dunstable\nherself had had any previous notice of this arrangement, but it was\nsupposed that the thing would turn out as a matter of course. Mr.\nSowerby had no money, but then he was witty, clever, good-looking,\nand a member of Parliament. He lived before the world, represented an\nold family, and had an old place. How could Miss Dunstable possibly\ndo better? She was not so young now, and it was time that she should\nlook about her.\n\nThe suggestion as regarded Mr. Sowerby was certainly true, and was\nnot the less so as regarded some of Mr. Sowerby's friends. His\nsister, Mrs. Harold Smith, had devoted herself to the work, and with\nthis view had run up a dear friendship with Miss Dunstable. The\nbishop had intimated, nodding his head knowingly, that it would\nbe a very good thing. Mrs. Proudie had given in her adherence. Mr.\nSupplehouse had been made to understand that it must be a case of\n\"Paws off\" with him, as long as he remained in that part of the\nworld; and even the duke himself had desired Fothergill to manage it.\n\n\"He owes me an enormous sum of money,\" said the duke, who held all\nMr. Sowerby's title-deeds, \"and I doubt whether the security will be\nsufficient.\"\n\n\"Your grace will find the security quite sufficient,\" said Mr.\nFothergill; \"but nevertheless it would be a good match.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said the duke. And then it became Mr. Fothergill's duty\nto see that Mr. Sowerby and Miss Dunstable became man and wife as\nspeedily as possible.\n\nSome of the party, who were more wide awake than others, declared\nthat he had made the offer; others, that he was just going to do so;\nand one very knowing lady went so far at one time as to say that he\nwas making it at that moment. Bets also were laid as to the lady's\nanswer, as to the terms of the settlement, and as to the period\nof the marriage,--of all which poor Miss Dunstable of course knew\nnothing.\n\nMr. Sowerby, in spite of the publicity of his proceedings, proceeded\nin the matter very well. He said little about it to those who joked\nwith him, but carried on the fight with what best knowledge he had\nin such matters. But so much it is given to us to declare with\ncertainty, that he had not proposed on the evening previous to the\nmorning fixed for the departure of Mark Robarts.\n\nDuring the last two days Mr. Sowerby's intimacy with Mark had grown\nwarmer and warmer. He had talked to the vicar confidentially about\nthe doings of these bigwigs now present at the castle, as though\nthere were no other guest there with whom he could speak in so free\na manner. He confided, it seemed, much more in Mark than in his\nbrother-in-law, Harold Smith, or in any of his brother members of\nParliament, and had altogether opened his heart to him in this affair\nof his anticipated marriage. Now Mr. Sowerby was a man of mark in the\nworld, and all this flattered our young clergyman not a little.\n\nOn that evening before Robarts went away Sowerby asked him to come up\ninto his bedroom when the whole party was breaking up, and there got\nhim into an easy-chair while he, Sowerby, walked up and down the\nroom.\n\n\"You can hardly tell, my dear fellow,\" said he, \"the state of nervous\nanxiety in which this puts me.\"\n\n\"Why don't you ask her and have done with it? She seems to me to be\nfond of your society.\"\n\n\"Ah, it is not that only; there are wheels within wheels;\" and then\nhe walked once or twice up and down the room, during which Mark\nthought that he might as well go to bed.\n\n\"Not that I mind telling you everything,\" said Sowerby. \"I am\ninfernally hard up for a little ready money just at the present\nmoment. It may be, and indeed I think it will be, the case that I\nshall be ruined in this matter for the want of it.\"\n\n\"Could not Harold Smith give it you?\"\n\n\"Ha, ha, ha! you don't know Harold Smith. Did you ever hear of his\nlending a man a shilling in his life?\"\n\n\"Or Supplehouse?\"\n\n\"Lord love you! You see me and Supplehouse together here, and he\ncomes and stays at my house, and all that; but Supplehouse and I are\nno friends. Look you here, Mark--I would do more for your little\nfinger than for his whole hand, including the pen which he holds in\nit. Fothergill indeed might--but then I know Fothergill is pressed\nhimself at the present moment. It is deuced hard, isn't it? I must\ngive up the whole game if I can't put my hand upon \u00c2\u00a3400 within the\nnext two days.\"\n\n\"Ask her for it, herself.\"\n\n\"What, the woman I wish to marry! No, Mark, I'm not quite come to\nthat. I would sooner lose her than that.\"\n\nMark sat silent, gazing at the fire and wishing that he was in his\nown bedroom. He had an idea that Mr. Sowerby wished him to produce\nthis \u00c2\u00a3400; and he knew also that he had not \u00c2\u00a3400 in the world, and\nthat if he had he would be acting very foolishly to give it to Mr.\nSowerby. But nevertheless he felt half fascinated by the man, and\nhalf afraid of him.\n\n\"Lufton owes it to me to do more than this,\" continued Mr. Sowerby;\n\"but then Lufton is not here.\"\n\n\"Why, he has just paid five thousand pounds for you.\"\n\n\"Paid five thousand pounds for me! Indeed he has done no such thing:\nnot a sixpence of it came into my hands. Believe me, Mark, you don't\nknow the whole of that yet. Not that I mean to say a word against\nLufton. He is the soul of honour; though so deucedly dilatory in\nmoney matters. He thought he was right all through that affair, but\nno man was ever so confoundedly wrong. Why, don't you remember that\nthat was the very view you took of it yourself?\"\n\n\"I remember saying that I thought he was mistaken.\"\n\n\"Of course he was mistaken. And dearly the mistake cost me. I had to\nmake good the money for two or three years. And my property is not\nlike his--I wish it were.\"\n\n\"Marry Miss Dunstable, and that will set it all right for you.\"\n\n\"Ah! so I would if I had this money. At any rate I would bring it to\nthe point. Now, I tell you what, Mark; if you'll assist me at this\nstrait I'll never forget it. And the time will come round when I may\nbe able to do something for you.\"\n\n\"I have not got a hundred, no, not fifty pounds by me in the world.\"\n\n\"Of course you've not. Men don't walk about the streets with \u00c2\u00a3400 in\ntheir pockets. I don't suppose there's a single man here in the house\nwith such a sum at his bankers', unless it be the duke.\"\n\n\"What is it you want then?\"\n\n\"Why, your name, to be sure. Believe me, my dear fellow, I would not\nask you really to put your hand into your pocket to such a tune as\nthat. Allow me to draw on you for that amount at three months. Long\nbefore that time I shall be flush enough.\" And then, before Mark\ncould answer, he had a bill stamp and pen and ink out on the table\nbefore him, and was filling in the bill as though his friend had\nalready given his consent.\n\n\"Upon my word, Sowerby, I had rather not do that.\"\n\n\"Why! what are you afraid of?\"--Mr. Sowerby asked this very sharply.\n\"Did you ever hear of my having neglected to take up a bill when it\nfell due?\" Robarts thought that he had heard of such a thing; but\nin his confusion he was not exactly sure, and so he said nothing.\n\n\"No, my boy; I have not come to that. Look here: just you write,\n'Accepted, Mark Robarts,' across that, and then you shall never hear\nof the transaction again;--and you will have obliged me for ever.\"\n\n\"As a clergyman it would be wrong of me,\" said Robarts.\n\n\"As a clergyman! Come, Mark! If you don't like to do as much as that\nfor a friend, say so; but don't let us have that sort of humbug. If\nthere be one class of men whose names would be found more frequent on\nthe backs of bills in the provincial banks than another, clergymen\nare that class. Come, old fellow, you won't throw me over when I am\nso hard pushed.\"\n\nMark Robarts took the pen and signed the bill. It was the first time\nin his life that he had ever done such an act. Sowerby then shook\nhim cordially by the hand, and he walked off to his own bedroom a\nwretched man.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nTHE VICAR'S RETURN.\n\n\nThe next morning Mr. Robarts took leave of all his grand friends with\na heavy heart. He had lain awake half the night thinking of what he\nhad done and trying to reconcile himself to his position. He had not\nwell left Mr. Sowerby's room before he felt certain that at the end\nof three months he would again be troubled about that \u00c2\u00a3400. As he\nwent along the passage all the man's known antecedents crowded upon\nhim much quicker than he could remember them when seated in that\narm-chair with the bill stamp before him, and the pen and ink ready\nto his hand. He remembered what Lord Lufton had told him--how he had\ncomplained of having been left in the lurch; he thought of all the\nstories current through the entire county as to the impossibility\nof getting money from Chaldicotes; he brought to mind the known\ncharacter of the man, and then he knew that he must prepare himself\nto make good a portion at least of that heavy payment.\n\nWhy had he come to this horrid place? Had he not everything at home\nat Framley which the heart of man could desire? No; the heart of man\ncan desire deaneries--the heart, that is, of the man vicar; and the\nheart of the man dean can desire bishoprics; and before the eyes\nof the man bishop does there not loom the transcendental glory of\nLambeth? He had owned to himself that he was ambitious; but he had to\nown to himself now also that he had hitherto taken but a sorry path\ntowards the object of his ambition.\n\nOn the next morning at breakfast-time, before his horse and gig\narrived for him, no one was so bright as his friend Sowerby. \"So you\nare off, are you?\" said he.\n\n\"Yes, I shall go this morning.\"\n\n\"Say everything that's kind from me to Lufton. I may possibly see him\nout hunting; otherwise we shan't meet till the spring. As to my going\nto Framley, that's out of the question. Her ladyship would look for\nmy tail, and swear that she smelt brimstone. By-bye, old fellow!\"\n\nThe German student when he first made his bargain with the devil felt\nan indescribable attraction to his new friend; and such was the case\nnow with Robarts. He shook Sowerby's hand very warmly, said that\nhe hoped he should meet him soon somewhere, and professed himself\nspecially anxious to hear how that affair with the lady came off.\nAs he had made his bargain--as he had undertaken to pay nearly\nhalf-a-year's income for his dear friend--ought he not to have as\nmuch value as possible for his money? If the dear friendship of\nthis flash member of Parliament did not represent that value, what\nelse did do so? But then he felt, or fancied that he felt, that Mr.\nSowerby did not care for him so much this morning as he had done on\nthe previous evening. \"By-bye,\" said Mr. Sowerby, but he spoke no\nword as to such future meetings, nor did he even promise to write.\nMr. Sowerby probably had many things on his mind; and it might be\nthat it behoved him, having finished one piece of business,\nimmediately to look to another.\n\nThe sum for which Robarts had made himself responsible--which he so\nmuch feared that he would be called upon to pay--was very nearly\nhalf-a-year's income; and as yet he had not put by one shilling since\nhe had been married. When he found himself settled in his parsonage,\nhe found also that all the world regarded him as a rich man. He had\ntaken the dictum of all the world as true, and had set himself to\nwork to live comfortably. He had no absolute need of a curate; but he\ncould afford the \u00c2\u00a370--as Lady Lufton had said rather injudiciously;\nand by keeping Jones in the parish he would be acting charitably to a\nbrother clergyman, and would also place himself in a more independent\nposition. Lady Lufton had wished to see her pet clergyman well-to-do\nand comfortable; but now, as matters had turned out, she much\nregretted this affair of the curate. Mr. Jones, she said to herself,\nmore than once, must be made to depart from Framley.\n\nHe had given his wife a pony-carriage, and for himself he had a\nsaddle-horse, and a second horse for his gig. A man in his position,\nwell-to-do as he was, required as much as that. He had a footman\nalso, and a gardener, and a groom. The two latter were absolutely\nnecessary, but about the former there had been a question. His wife\nhad been decidedly hostile to the footman; but, in all such matters\nas that, to doubt is to be lost. When the footman had been discussed\nfor a week it became quite clear to the master that he also was a\nnecessary.\n\nAs he drove home that morning he pronounced to himself the doom of\nthat footman, and the doom also of that saddle-horse. They at any\nrate should go. And then he would spend no more money in trips\nto Scotland; and above all, he would keep out of the bedrooms of\nimpoverished members of Parliament at the witching hour of midnight.\nSuch resolves did he make to himself as he drove home; and bethought\nhimself wearily how that \u00c2\u00a3400 might be made to be forthcoming. As to\nany assistance in the matter from Sowerby,--of that he gave himself\nno promise.\n\nBut he almost felt himself happy again as his wife came out into the\nporch to meet him, with a silk shawl over her head, and pretending to\nshiver as she watched him descending from his gig.\n\n\"My dear old man,\" she said, as she led him into the warm\ndrawing-room with all his wrappings still about him, \"you must be\nstarved.\" But Mark during the whole drive had been thinking too much\nof that transaction in Mr. Sowerby's bedroom to remember that the air\nwas cold. Now he had his arm round his own dear Fanny's waist; but\nwas he to tell her of that transaction? At any rate he would not do\nit now, while his two boys were in his arms, rubbing the moisture\nfrom his whiskers with their kisses. After all, what is there equal\nto that coming home?\n\n\"And so Lufton is here. I say, Frank, gently, old boy,\"--Frank was\nhis eldest son--\"you'll have baby into the fender.\"\n\n\"Let me take baby; it's impossible to hold the two of them, they\nare so strong,\" said the proud mother. \"Oh, yes, he came home early\nyesterday.\"\n\n\"Have you seen him?\"\n\n\"He was here yesterday, with her ladyship; and I lunched there\nto-day. The letter came, you know, in time to stop the Merediths.\nThey don't go till to-morrow, so you will meet them after all. Sir\nGeorge is wild about it, but Lady Lufton would have her way. You\nnever saw her in such a state as she is.\"\n\n\"Good spirits, eh?\"\n\n\"I should think so. All Lord Lufton's horses are coming, and he's to\nbe here till March.\"\n\n\"Till March!\"\n\n\"So her ladyship whispered to me. She could not conceal her triumph\nat his coming. He's going to give up Leicestershire this year\naltogether. I wonder what has brought it all about?\" Mark knew very\nwell what had brought it about; he had been made acquainted, as the\nreader has also, with the price at which Lady Lufton had purchased\nher son's visit. But no one had told Mrs. Robarts that the mother had\nmade her son a present of five thousand pounds.\n\n\"She's in a good humour about everything now,\" continued Fanny; \"so\nyou need say nothing at all about Gatherum Castle.\"\n\n\"But she was very angry when she first heard it; was she not?\"\n\n\"Well, Mark, to tell the truth, she was; and we had quite a scene\nthere up in her own room up-stairs,--Justinia and I. She had heard\nsomething else that she did not like at the same time; and then--but\nyou know her way. She blazed up quite hot.\"\n\n\"And said all manner of horrid things about me.\"\n\n\"About the duke she did. You know she never did like the duke; and\nfor the matter of that, neither do I. I tell you that fairly, Master\nMark!\"\n\n\"The duke is not so bad as he's painted.\"\n\n\"Ah, that's what you say about another great person. However, he\nwon't come here to trouble us, I suppose. And then I left her, not in\nthe best temper in the world; for I blazed up too, you must know.\"\n\n\"I am sure you did,\" said Mark, pressing his arm round her waist.\n\n\"And then we were going to have a dreadful war, I thought; and I came\nhome and wrote such a doleful letter to you. But what should happen\nwhen I had just closed it, but in came her ladyship--all alone,\nand--. But I can't tell you what she did or said, only she behaved\nbeautifully; just like herself too; so full of love and truth and\nhonesty. There's nobody like her, Mark; and she's better than all the\ndukes that ever wore--whatever dukes do wear.\"\n\n\"Horns and hoofs; that's their usual apparel, according to you and\nLady Lufton,\" said he, remembering what Mr. Sowerby had said of\nhimself.\n\n\"You may say what you like about me, Mark, but you shan't abuse\nLady Lufton. And if horns and hoofs mean wickedness and dissipation,\nI believe it's not far wrong. But get off your big coat and make\nyourself comfortable.\" And that was all the scolding that Mark\nRobarts got from his wife on the occasion of his great iniquity.\n\n\"I will certainly tell her about this bill transaction,\" he said to\nhimself; \"but not to-day; not till after I have seen Lufton.\"\n\nThat evening they dined at Framley Court, and there they met the\nyoung lord; they found also Lady Lufton still in high good-humour.\nLord Lufton himself was a fine, bright-looking young man; not so tall\nas Mark Robarts, and with perhaps less intelligence marked on his\nface; but his features were finer, and there was in his countenance a\nthorough appearance of good-humour and sweet temper. It was, indeed,\na pleasant face to look upon, and dearly Lady Lufton loved to gaze at\nit.\n\n\"Well, Mark, so you have been among the Philistines?\" that was his\nlordship's first remark. Robarts laughed as he took his friend's\nhands, and bethought himself how truly that was the case; that he\nwas, in very truth, already \"himself in bonds under Philistian\nyoke.\" Alas, alas, it is very hard to break asunder the bonds of the\nlatter-day Philistines. When a Samson does now and then pull a temple\ndown about their ears, is he not sure to be engulfed in the ruin with\nthem? There is no horse-leech that sticks so fast as your latter-day\nPhilistine.\n\n\"So you have caught Sir George, after all,\" said Lady Lufton; and\nthat was nearly all she did say in allusion to his absence. There\nwas afterwards some conversation about the lecture, and from her\nladyship's remarks, it certainly was apparent that she did not like\nthe people among whom the vicar had been lately staying; but she said\nno word that was personal to him himself, or that could be taken\nas a reproach. The little episode of Mrs. Proudie's address in the\nlecture-room had already reached Framley, and it was only to be\nexpected that Lady Lufton should enjoy the joke. She would affect to\nbelieve that the body of the lecture had been given by the bishop's\nwife; and afterwards, when Mark described her costume at that Sunday\nmorning breakfast-table, Lady Lufton would assume that such had been\nthe dress in which she had exercised her faculties in public.\n\n\"I would have given a five-pound note to have heard it,\" said Sir\nGeorge.\n\n\"So would not I,\" said Lady Lufton. \"When one hears of such things\ndescribed so graphically as Mr. Robarts now tells it, one can hardly\nhelp laughing. But it would give me great pain to see the wife of one\nof our bishops place herself in such a situation. For he is a bishop\nafter all.\"\n\n\"Well, upon my word, my lady, I agree with Meredith,\" said Lord\nLufton. \"It must have been good fun. As it did happen, you know,--as\nthe Church was doomed to the disgrace, I should like to have heard\nit.\"\n\n\"I know you would have been shocked, Ludovic.\"\n\n\"I should have got over that in time, mother. It would have been\nlike a bull-fight I suppose--horrible to see no doubt, but extremely\ninteresting. And Harold Smith, Mark; what did he do all the while?\"\n\n\"It didn't take so very long, you know,\" said Robarts.\n\n\"And the poor bishop,\" said Lady Meredith; \"how did he look? I really\ndo pity him.\"\n\n\"Well, he was asleep, I think.\"\n\n\"What, slept through it all?\" said Sir George.\n\n\"It awakened him; and then he jumped up and said something.\"\n\n\"What, out loud too?\"\n\n\"Only one word or so.\"\n\n\"What a disgraceful scene!\" said Lady Lufton. \"To those who remember\nthe good old man who was in the diocese before him it is perfectly\nshocking. He confirmed you, Ludovic, and you ought to remember\nhim. It was over at Barchester, and you went and lunched with him\nafterwards.\"\n\n\"I do remember; and especially this, that I never ate such tarts\nin my life, before or since. The old man particularly called my\nattention to them, and seemed remarkably pleased that I concurred in\nhis sentiments. There are no such tarts as those going in the palace\nnow, I'll be bound.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Proudie will be very happy to do her best for you if you will\ngo and try,\" said Sir George.\n\n\"I beg that he will do no such thing,\" said Lady Lufton, and that was\nthe only severe word she said about any of Mark's visitings.\n\nAs Sir George Meredith was there, Robarts could say nothing then to\nLord Lufton about Mr. Sowerby and Mr. Sowerby's money affairs; but he\ndid make an appointment for a _t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aate_ on the next morning.\n\n\"You must come down and see my nags, Mark; they came to-day. The\nMerediths will be off at twelve, and then we can have an hour\ntogether.\" Mark said he would, and then went home with his wife under\nhis arm.\n\n\"Well, now, is not she kind?\" said Fanny, as soon as they were out on\nthe gravel together.\n\n\"She is kind; kinder than I can tell you just at present. But did you\never know anything so bitter as she is to the poor bishop? And really\nthe bishop is not so bad.\"\n\n\"Yes; I know something much more bitter; and that is what she thinks\nof the bishop's wife. And you know, Mark, it was so unladylike, her\ngetting up in that way. What must the people of Barchester think of\nher?\"\n\n\"As far as I could see the people of Barchester liked it.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, Mark; they could not. But never mind that now. I want you\nto own that she is good.\" And then Mrs. Robarts went on with another\nlong eulogy on the dowager. Since that affair of the pardon-begging\nat the parsonage Mrs. Robarts hardly knew how to think well enough of\nher friend. And the evening had been so pleasant after the dreadful\nstorm and threatenings of hurricanes; her husband had been so well\nreceived after his lapse of judgment; the wounds that had looked so\nsore had been so thoroughly healed, and everything was so pleasant.\nHow all of this would have been changed had she known of that little\nbill!\n\nAt twelve the next morning the lord and the vicar were walking\nthrough the Framley stables together. Quite a commotion had been\nmade there, for the larger portion of these buildings had of late\nyears seldom been used. But now all was crowding and activity.\nSeven or eight very precious animals had followed Lord Lufton from\nLeicestershire, and all of them required dimensions that were thought\nto be rather excessive by the Framley old-fashioned groom. My lord,\nhowever, had a head man of his own who took the matter quite into his\nown hands.\n\nMark, priest as he was, was quite worldly enough to be fond of a good\nhorse; and for some little time allowed Lord Lufton to descant on the\nmerit of this four-year-old filly, and that magnificent Rattlebones\ncolt, out of a Mousetrap mare; but he had other things that lay\nheavy on his mind, and after bestowing half an hour on the stud, he\ncontrived to get his friend away to the shrubbery walks.\n\n\"So you have settled with Sowerby,\" Robarts began by saying.\n\n\"Settled with him; yes, but do you know the price?\"\n\n\"I believe that you have paid five thousand pounds.\"\n\n\"Yes, and about three before; and that in a matter in which I did not\nreally owe one shilling. Whatever I do in future, I'll keep out of\nSowerby's grip.\"\n\n\"But you don't think he has been unfair to you.\"\n\n\"Mark, to tell you the truth I have banished the affair from my mind,\nand don't wish to take it up again. My mother has paid the money to\nsave the property, and of course I must pay her back. But I think\nI may promise that I will not have any more money dealings with\nSowerby. I will not say that he is dishonest, but at any rate he is\nsharp.\"\n\n\"Well, Lufton; what will you say when I tell you that I have put my\nname to a bill for him, for four hundred pounds?\"\n\n\"Say; why I should say--; but you're joking; a man in your position\nwould never do such a thing.\"\n\n\"But I have done it.\"\n\nLord Lufton gave a long low whistle.\n\n\"He asked me the last night that I was there, making a great\nfavour of it, and declaring that no bill of his had ever yet been\ndishonoured.\"\n\nLord Lufton whistled again. \"No bill of his dishonoured! Why the\npocket-books of the Jews are stuffed full of his dishonoured papers!\nAnd you have really given him your name for four hundred pounds?\"\n\n\"I have certainly.\"\n\n\"At what date?\"\n\n\"Three months.\"\n\n\"And have you thought where you are to get the money?\"\n\n\"I know very well that I can't get it; not at least by that time. The\nbankers must renew it for me, and I must pay it by degrees. That is,\nif Sowerby really does not take it up.\"\n\n\"It is just as likely that he will take up the national debt.\"\n\nRobarts then told him about the projected marriage with Miss\nDunstable, giving it as his opinion that the lady would probably\naccept the gentleman.\n\n\"Not at all improbable,\" said his lordship, \"for Sowerby is an\nagreeable fellow; and if it be so, he will have all that he wants\nfor life. But his creditors will gain nothing. The duke, who has his\ntitle-deeds, will doubtless get his money, and the estate will in\nfact belong to the wife. But the small fry, such as you, will not get\na shilling.\"\n\nPoor Mark! He had had an inkling of this before; but it had hardly\npresented itself to him in such certain terms. It was, then, a\npositive fact, that in punishment for his weakness in having signed\nthat bill he would have to pay, not only four hundred pounds, but\nfour hundred pounds with interest, and expenses of renewal, and\ncommission, and bill stamps. Yes; he had certainly got among the\nPhilistines during that visit of his to the duke. It began to appear\nto him pretty clearly that it would have been better for him to have\nrelinquished altogether the glories of Chaldicotes and Gatherum\nCastle.\n\nAnd now, how was he to tell his wife?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nLUCY ROBARTS.\n\n\nAnd now how was he to tell his wife? That was the consideration heavy\non Mark Robarts' mind when last we left him; and he turned the matter\noften in his thoughts before he could bring himself to a resolution.\nAt last he did do so, and one may say that it was not altogether a\nbad one, if only he could carry it out.\n\nHe would ascertain in what bank that bill of his had been discounted.\nHe would ask Sowerby, and if he could not learn from him, he would go\nto the three banks in Barchester. That it had been taken to one of\nthem he felt tolerably certain. He would explain to the manager his\nconviction that he would have to make good the amount, his inability\nto do so at the end of the three months, and the whole state of his\nincome; and then the banker would explain to him how the matter might\nbe arranged. He thought that he could pay \u00c2\u00a350 every three months with\ninterest. As soon as this should have been concerted with the banker,\nhe would let his wife know all about it. Were he to tell her at the\npresent moment, while the matter was all unsettled, the intelligence\nwould frighten her into illness.\n\nBut on the next morning there came to him tidings by the hands of\nRobin postman, which for a long while upset all his plans. The letter\nwas from Exeter. His father had been taken ill, and had very quickly\nbeen pronounced to be in danger. That evening--the evening on which\nhis sister wrote--the old man was much worse, and it was desirable\nthat Mark should go off to Exeter as quickly as possible. Of\ncourse he went to Exeter--again leaving the Framley souls at the\nmercy of the Welsh Low Churchman. Framley is only four miles from\nSilverbridge, and at Silverbridge he was on the direct road to the\nwest. He was therefore at Exeter before nightfall on that day.\n\nBut nevertheless he arrived there too late to see his father again\nalive. The old man's illness had been sudden and rapid, and he\nexpired without again seeing his eldest son. Mark arrived at the\nhouse of mourning just as they were learning to realize the full\nchange in their position.\n\nThe doctor's career had been on the whole successful, but\nnevertheless he did not leave behind him as much money as the world\nhad given him credit for possessing. Who ever does? Dr. Robarts had\neducated a large family, had always lived with every comfort, and\nhad never possessed a shilling but what he had earned himself. A\nphysician's fees come in, no doubt, with comfortable rapidity as soon\nas rich old gentlemen and middle-aged ladies begin to put their faith\nin him; but fees run out almost with equal rapidity when a wife and\nseven children are treated to everything that the world considers\nmost desirable. Mark, we have seen, had been educated at Harrow and\nOxford, and it may be said, therefore, that he had received his\npatrimony early in life. For Gerald Robarts, the second brother, a\ncommission had been bought in a crack regiment. He also had been\nlucky, having lived and become a captain in the Crimea; and the\npurchase-money was lodged for his majority. And John Robarts, the\nyoungest, was a clerk in the Petty Bag Office, and was already\nassistant private secretary to the Lord Petty Bag himself--a place of\nconsiderable trust, if not hitherto of large emolument; and on his\neducation money had been spent freely, for in these days a young man\ncannot get into the Petty Bag Office without knowing at least three\nmodern languages; and he must be well up in trigonometry too, in\nbible theology, or in one dead language--at his option.\n\nAnd the doctor had four daughters. The two elder were married,\nincluding that Blanche with whom Lord Lufton was to have fallen in\nlove at the vicar's wedding. A Devonshire squire had done this in the\nlord's place; but on marrying her it was necessary that he should\nhave a few thousand pounds, two or three perhaps, and the old doctor\nhad managed that they should be forthcoming. The elder also had not\nbeen sent away from the paternal mansion quite empty-handed. There\nwere, therefore, at the time of the doctor's death two children left\nat home, of whom one only, Lucy, the younger, will come much across\nus in the course of our story.\n\nMark stayed for ten days at Exeter, he and the Devonshire squire\nhaving been named as executors in the will. In this document it was\nexplained that the doctor trusted that provision had been made for\nmost of his children. As for his dear son Mark, he said, he was aware\nthat he need be under no uneasiness. On hearing this read Mark smiled\nsweetly, and looked very gracious; but, nevertheless, his heart did\nsink somewhat within him, for there had been a hope that a small\nwindfall, coming now so opportunely, might enable him to rid himself\nat once of that dreadful Sowerby incubus. And then the will went on\nto declare that Mary, and Gerald, and Blanche, had also, by God's\nprovidence, been placed beyond want. And here, looking into the\nsquire's face, one might have thought that his heart fell a little\nalso; for he had not so full a command of his feelings as his\nbrother-in-law, who had been so much more before the world. To John,\nthe assistant private secretary, was left a legacy of a thousand\npounds; and to Jane and Lucy certain sums in certain four per cents.,\nwhich were quite sufficient to add an efficient value to the hands\nof those young ladies in the eyes of most prudent young would-be\nBenedicts. Over and beyond this there was nothing but the furniture,\nwhich he desired might be sold, and the proceeds divided among them\nall. It might come to sixty or seventy pounds a piece, and pay the\nexpenses incidental on his death.\n\nAnd then all men and women there and thereabouts said that old Dr.\nRobarts had done well. His life had been good and prosperous, and\nhis will was just. And Mark, among others, so declared,--and was so\nconvinced in spite of his own little disappointment. And on the third\nmorning after the reading of the will Squire Crowdy, of Creamclotted\nHall, altogether got over his grief, and said that it was all right.\nAnd then it was decided that Jane should go home with him,--for\nthere was a brother squire who, it was thought, might have an eye to\nJane;--and Lucy, the younger, should be taken to Framley Parsonage.\nIn a fortnight from the receipt of that letter Mark arrived at his\nown house with his sister Lucy under his wing.\n\nAll this interfered greatly with Mark's wise resolution as to\nthe Sowerby-bill incubus. In the first place he could not get to\nBarchester as soon as he had intended, and then an idea came across\nhim that possibly it might be well that he should borrow the money of\nhis brother John, explaining the circumstances, of course, and paying\nhim due interest. But he had not liked to broach the subject when\nthey were there in Exeter, standing, as it were, over their father's\ngrave, and so the matter was postponed. There was still ample time\nfor arrangement before the bill would come due, and he would not tell\nFanny till he had made up his mind what that arrangement would be. It\nwould kill her, he said to himself over and over again, were he to\ntell her of it without being able to tell her also that the means of\nliquidating the debt were to be forthcoming.\n\nAnd now I must say a word about Lucy Robarts. If one might only go on\nwithout those descriptions, how pleasant it would all be! But Lucy\nRobarts has to play a forward part in this little drama, and those\nwho care for such matters must be made to understand something of her\nform and likeness. When last we mentioned her as appearing, though\nnot in any prominent position, at her brother's wedding, she was only\nsixteen; but now, at the time of her father's death, somewhat over\ntwo years having since elapsed, she was nearly nineteen. Laying aside\nfor the sake of clearness that indefinite term of girl--for girls\nare girls from the age of three up to forty-three, if not previously\nmarried--dropping that generic word, we may say that then, at that\nwedding of her brother, she was a child; and now, at the death of her\nfather, she was a woman.\n\nNothing, perhaps, adds so much to womanhood, turns the child so\nquickly into a woman, as such death-bed scenes as these. Hitherto\nbut little had fallen to Lucy to do in the way of woman's duties. Of\nmoney transactions she had known nothing, beyond a jocose attempt\nto make her annual allowance of twenty-five pounds cover all her\npersonal wants--an attempt which was made jocose by the loving bounty\nof her father. Her sister, who was three years her elder--for John\ncame in between them--had managed the house; that is, she had made\nthe tea and talked to the housekeeper about the dinners. But Lucy had\nsat at her father's elbow, had read to him of evenings when he went\nto sleep, had brought him his slippers and looked after the comforts\nof his easy-chair. All this she had done as a child; but when she\nstood at the coffin head, and knelt at the coffin side, then she was\na woman.\n\nShe was smaller in stature than either of her three sisters, to all\nof whom had been acceded the praise of being fine women--a eulogy\nwhich the people of Exeter, looking back at the elder sisters, and\nthe general remembrance of them which pervaded the city, were not\nwilling to extend to Lucy. \"Dear--dear!\" had been said of her; \"poor\nLucy is not like a Robarts at all; is she, now, Mrs. Pole?\"--for\nas the daughters had become fine women, so had the sons grown into\nstalwart men. And then Mrs. Pole had answered: \"Not a bit; is she,\nnow? Only think what Blanche was at her age. But she has fine eyes,\nfor all that; and they do say she is the cleverest of them all.\"\n\nAnd that, too, is so true a description of her, that I do not know\nthat I can add much to it. She was not like Blanche; for Blanche had\na bright complexion, and a fine neck, and a noble bust, _et vera\nincessu patuit Dea_--a true goddess, that is, as far as the eye\nwent. She had a grand idea, moreover, of an apple-pie, and had not\nreigned eighteen months at Creamclotted Hall before she knew all the\nmysteries of pigs and milk, and most of those appertaining to cider\nand green geese.\n\nLucy had no neck at all worth speaking of,--no neck, I mean, that\never produced eloquence; she was brown, too, and had addicted herself\nin nowise, as she undoubtedly should have done, to larder utility. In\nregard to the neck and colour, poor girl, she could not help herself;\nbut in that other respect she must be held as having wasted her\nopportunities.\n\nBut then what eyes she had! Mrs. Pole was right there. They flashed\nupon you--not always softly; indeed not often softly, if you were a\nstranger to her; but whether softly or savagely, with a brilliancy\nthat dazzled you as you looked at them. And who shall say of what\ncolour they were? Green probably, for most eyes are green--green or\ngrey, if green be thought uncomely for an eye-colour. But it was not\ntheir colour, but their fire, which struck one with such surprise.\n\nLucy Robarts was thoroughly a brunette. Sometimes the dark tint\nof her cheek was exquisitely rich and lovely, and the fringes of\nher eyes were long and soft, and her small teeth, which one so\nseldom saw, were white as pearls, and her hair, though short, was\nbeautifully soft--by no means black, but yet of so dark a shade of\nbrown. Blanche, too, was noted for fine teeth. They were white and\nregular and lofty as a new row of houses in a French city. But then\nwhen she laughed she was all teeth; as she was all neck when she sat\nat the piano. But Lucy's teeth!--it was only now and again, when in\nsome sudden burst of wonder she would sit for a moment with her lips\napart, that the fine finished lines and dainty pearl-white colour of\nthat perfect set of ivory could be seen. Mrs. Pole would have said\na word of her teeth also, but that to her they had never been made\nvisible.\n\n\"But they do say that she is the cleverest of them all,\" Mrs. Pole\nhad added, very properly. The people of Exeter had expressed such an\nopinion, and had been quite just in doing so. I do not know how it\nhappens, but it always does happen, that everybody in every small\ntown knows which is the brightest-witted in every family. In this\nrespect Mrs. Pole had only expressed public opinion, and public\nopinion was right. Lucy Robarts was blessed with an intelligence\nkeener than that of her brothers or sisters.\n\n\"To tell the truth, Mark, I admire Lucy more than I do Blanche.\"\nThis had been said by Mrs. Robarts within a few hours of her having\nassumed that name. \"She's not a beauty, I know, but yet I do.\"\n\n\"My dearest Fanny!\" Mark had answered in a tone of surprise.\n\n\"I do then; of course people won't think so; but I never seem to care\nabout regular beauties. Perhaps I envy them too much.\"\n\nWhat Mark said next need not be repeated, but everybody may be\nsure that it contained some gross flattery for his young bride. He\nremembered this, however, and had always called Lucy his wife's pet.\nNeither of the sisters had since that been at Framley; and though\nFanny had spent a week at Exeter on the occasion of Blanche's\nmarriage, it could hardly be said that she was very intimate with\nthem. Nevertheless, when it became expedient that one of them should\ngo to Framley, the remembrance of what his wife had said immediately\ninduced Mark to make the offer to Lucy; and Jane, who was of a\nkindred soul with Blanche, was delighted to go to Creamclotted\nHall. The acres of Heavybed House, down in that fat Totnes country,\nadjoined those of Creamclotted Hall, and Heavybed House still wanted\na mistress.\n\nFanny was delighted when the news reached her. It would of course\nbe proper that one of his sisters should live with Mark under their\npresent circumstances, and she was happy to think that that quiet\nlittle bright-eyed creature was to come and nestle with her under the\nsame roof. The children should so love her--only not quite so much as\nthey loved mamma; and the snug little room that looks out over the\nporch, in which the chimney never smokes, should be made ready for\nher; and she should be allowed her share of driving the pony--which\nwas a great sacrifice of self on the part of Mrs. Robarts--and Lady\nLufton's best good-will should be bespoken. In fact, Lucy was not\nunfortunate in the destination that was laid out for her.\n\nLady Lufton had of course heard of the doctor's death, and had sent\nall manner of kind messages to Mark, advising him not to hurry home\nby any means until everything was settled at Exeter. And then she was\ntold of the new-comer that was expected in the parish. When she heard\nthat it was Lucy, the younger, she also was satisfied; for Blanche's\ncharms, though indisputable, had not been altogether to her taste. If\na second Blanche were to arrive there what danger might there not be\nfor young Lord Lufton!\n\n\"Quite right,\" said her ladyship, \"just what he ought to do. I\nthink I remember the young lady; rather small, is she not, and very\nretiring?\"\n\n\"Rather small and very retiring. What a description!\" said Lord\nLufton.\n\n\"Never mind, Ludovic; some young ladies must be small, and some\nat least ought to be retiring. We shall be delighted to make her\nacquaintance.\"\n\n\"I remember your other sister-in-law very well,\" said Lord Lufton.\n\"She was a beautiful woman.\"\n\n\"I don't think you will consider Lucy a beauty,\" said Mrs. Robarts.\n\n\"Small, retiring, and--\" so far Lord Lufton had gone, when Mrs.\nRobarts finished by the word, \"plain.\" She had liked Lucy's face, but\nshe had thought that others probably did not do so.\n\n\"Upon my word,\" said Lady Lufton, \"you don't deserve to have a\nsister-in-law. I remember her very well, and can say that she is not\nplain. I was very much taken with her manner at your wedding, my\ndear; and thought more of her than I did of the beauty, I can tell\nyou.\"\n\n\"I must confess I do not remember her at all,\" said his lordship. And\nso the conversation ended.\n\nAnd then at the end of the fortnight Mark arrived with his sister.\nThey did not reach Framley till long after dark--somewhere between\nsix and seven--and by this time it was December. There was snow on\nthe ground, and frost in the air, and no moon, and cautious men when\nthey went on the roads had their horses' shoes cocked. Such being the\nstate of the weather Mark's gig had been nearly filled with cloaks\nand shawls when it was sent over to Silverbridge. And a cart was sent\nfor Lucy's luggage, and all manner of preparations had been made.\nThree times had Fanny gone herself to see that the fire burned\nbrightly in the little room over the porch, and at the moment that\nthe sound of the wheels was heard she was engaged in opening her\nson's mind as to the nature of an aunt. Hitherto papa and mamma and\nLady Lufton were all that he had known, excepting, of course, the\nsatellites of the nursery.\n\nAnd then in three minutes Lucy was standing by the fire. Those three\nminutes had been taken up in embraces between the husband and the\nwife. Let who would be brought as a visitor to the house, after a\nfortnight's absence, she would kiss him before she welcomed any one\nelse. But then she turned to Lucy, and began to assist her with her\ncloaks.\n\n\"Oh, thank you,\" said Lucy; \"I'm not cold,--not very at least. Don't\ntrouble yourself: I can do it.\" But here she had made a false boast,\nfor her fingers had been so numbed that she could not do nor undo\nanything.\n\nThey were all in black, of course; but the sombreness of Lucy's\nclothes struck Fanny much more than her own. They seemed to have\nswallowed her up in their blackness, and to have made her almost\nan emblem of death. She did not look up, but kept her face turned\ntowards the fire, and seemed almost afraid of her position.\n\n\"She may say what she likes, Fanny,\" said Mark, \"but she is very\ncold. And so am I,--cold enough. You had better go up with her to her\nroom. We won't do much in the dressing way to-night; eh, Lucy?\"\n\nIn the bedroom Lucy thawed a little, and Fanny, as she kissed her,\nsaid to herself that she had been wrong as to that word \"plain.\"\nLucy, at any rate, was not plain.\n\n\"You will be used to us soon,\" said Fanny, \"and then I hope we shall\nmake you comfortable.\" And she took her sister-in-law's hand and\npressed it.\n\nLucy looked up at her, and her eyes then were tender enough. \"I am\nsure I shall be happy here,\" she said, \"with you. But--but--dear\npapa!\" And then they got into each other's arms, and had a great bout\nof kissing and crying. \"Plain,\" said Fanny to herself, as at last\nshe got her guest's hair smoothed and the tears washed from her\neyes--\"plain! She has the loveliest countenance that I ever looked at\nin my life!\"\n\n\"Your sister is quite beautiful,\" she said to Mark, as they talked\nher over alone before they went to sleep that night.\n\n\"No, she's not beautiful; but she's a very good girl, and clever\nenough too, in her sort of way.\"\n\n\"I think her perfectly lovely. I never saw such eyes in my life\nbefore.\"\n\n\"I'll leave her in your hands then; you shall get her a husband.\"\n\n\"That mayn't be so easy. I don't think she'd marry anybody.\"\n\n\"Well, I hope not. But she seems to me to be exactly cut out for an\nold maid;--to be aunt Lucy for ever and ever to your bairns.\"\n\n\"And so she shall, with all my heart. But I don't think she will,\nvery long. I have no doubt she will be hard to please; but if I were\na man I should fall in love with her at once. Did you ever observe\nher teeth, Mark?\"\n\n\"I don't think I ever did.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't know whether any one had a tooth in their head, I\nbelieve.\"\n\n\"No one except you, my dear; and I know all yours by heart.\"\n\n\"You are a goose.\"\n\n\"And a very sleepy one; so, if you please, I'll go to roost.\" And\nthus there was nothing more said about Lucy's beauty on that\noccasion.\n\nFor the first two days Mrs. Robarts did not make much of her\nsister-in-law. Lucy, indeed, was not demonstrative; and she was,\nmoreover, one of those few persons--for they are very few--who are\ncontented to go on with their existence without making themselves the\ncentre of any special outward circle. To the ordinary run of minds\nit is impossible not to do this. A man's own dinner is to himself\nso important that he cannot bring himself to believe that it is a\nmatter utterly indifferent to every one else. A lady's collection of\nbaby-clothes, in early years, and of house linen and curtain-fringes\nin later life, is so very interesting to her own eyes, that she\ncannot believe but what other people will rejoice to behold it. I\nwould not, however, be held as regarding this tendency as evil. It\nleads to conversation of some sort among people, and perhaps to a\nkind of sympathy. Mrs. Jones will look at Mrs. White's linen-chest,\nhoping that Mrs. White may be induced to look at hers. One can only\npour out of a jug that which is in it. For the most of us, if we do\nnot talk of ourselves, or at any rate of the individual circles of\nwhich we are the centres, we can talk of nothing. I cannot hold with\nthose who wish to put down the insignificant chatter of the world.\nAs for myself, I am always happy to look at Mrs. Jones's linen,\nand never omit an opportunity of giving her the details of my own\ndinners.\n\nBut Lucy Robarts had not this gift. She had come there as a stranger\ninto her sister-in-law's house, and at first seemed as though she\nwould be contented in simply having her corner in the drawing-room\nand her place at the parlour-table. She did not seem to need the\ncomforts of condolence and open-hearted talking. I do not mean to say\nthat she was moody, that she did not answer when she was spoken to,\nor that she took no notice of the children; but she did not at once\nthrow herself and all her hopes and sorrows into Fanny's heart, as\nFanny would have had her do.\n\nMrs. Robarts herself was what we call demonstrative. When she was\nangry with Lady Lufton she showed it. And as since that time her love\nand admiration for Lady Lufton had increased, she showed that also.\nWhen she was in any way displeased with her husband, she could\nnot hide it, even though she tried to do so, and fancied herself\nsuccessful;--no more than she could hide her warm, constant,\noverflowing woman's love. She could not walk through a room hanging\non her husband's arm without seeming to proclaim to every one there\nthat she thought him the best man in it. She was demonstrative, and\ntherefore she was the more disappointed in that Lucy did not rush at\nonce with all her cares into her open heart.\n\n\"She is so quiet,\" Fanny said to her husband.\n\n\"That's her nature,\" said Mark. \"She always was quiet as a child.\nWhile we were smashing everything, she would never crack a teacup.\"\n\n\"I wish she would break something now,\" said Fanny, \"and then perhaps\nwe should get to talk about it.\" But she did not on this account\ngive over loving her sister-in-law. She probably valued her the more,\nunconsciously, for not having those aptitudes with which she herself\nwas endowed.\n\nAnd then after two days Lady Lufton called; of course it may be\nsupposed that Fanny had said a good deal to her new inmate about Lady\nLufton. A neighbour of that kind in the country exercises so large an\ninfluence upon the whole tenor of one's life, that to abstain from\nsuch talk is out of the question. Mrs. Robarts had been brought up\nalmost under the dowager's wing, and of course she regarded her as\nbeing worthy of much talking. Do not let persons on this account\nsuppose that Mrs. Robarts was a tuft-hunter, or a toad-eater. If they\ndo not see the difference they have yet got to study the earliest\nprinciples of human nature.\n\nLady Lufton called, and Lucy was struck dumb. Fanny was particularly\nanxious that her ladyship's first impression should be favourable,\nand to effect this, she especially endeavoured to throw the two\ntogether during that visit. But in this she was unwise. Lady Lufton,\nhowever, had woman-craft enough not to be led into any egregious\nerror by Lucy's silence.\n\n\"And what day will you come and dine with us?\" said Lady Lufton,\nturning expressly to her old friend Fanny.\n\n\"Oh, do you name the day. We never have many engagements, you know.\"\n\n\"Will Thursday do, Miss Robarts? You will meet nobody you know, only\nmy son; so you need not regard it as going out. Fanny here will tell\nyou that stepping over to Framley Court is no more going out, than\nwhen you go from one room to another in the parsonage. Is it, Fanny?\"\n\nFanny laughed and said that that stepping over to Framley Court\ncertainly was done so often that perhaps they did not think so much\nabout it as they ought to do.\n\n\"We consider ourselves a sort of happy family here, Miss Robarts,\nand are delighted to have the opportunity of including you in the\nm\u00c3\u00a9nage.\"\n\nLucy gave her ladyship one of her sweetest smiles, but what she said\nat that moment was inaudible. It was plain, however, that she could\nnot bring herself even to go as far as Framley Court for her dinner\njust at present. \"It was very kind of Lady Lufton,\" she said to\nFanny; \"but it was so very soon, and--and--and if they would only\ngo without her, she would be so happy.\" But as the object was to go\nwith her--expressly to take her there--the dinner was adjourned for a\nshort time--_sine die_.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nGRISELDA GRANTLY.\n\n\nIt was nearly a month after this that Lucy was first introduced to\nLord Lufton, and then it was brought about only by accident. During\nthat time Lady Lufton had been often at the parsonage, and had in a\ncertain degree learned to know Lucy; but the stranger in the parish\nhad never yet plucked up courage to accept one of the numerous\ninvitations that had reached her. Mr. Robarts and his wife had\nfrequently been at Framley Court, but the dreaded day of Lucy's\ninitiation had not yet arrived.\n\nShe had seen Lord Lufton in church, but hardly so as to know him, and\nbeyond that she had not seen him at all. One day, however--or rather,\none evening, for it was already dusk--he overtook her and Mrs.\nRobarts on the road walking towards the vicarage. He had his gun on\nhis shoulder, three pointers were at his heels, and a gamekeeper\nfollowed a little in the rear.\n\n\"How are you, Mrs. Robarts?\" he said, almost before he had overtaken\nthem. \"I have been chasing you along the road for the last half mile.\nI never knew ladies walk so fast.\"\n\n\"We should be frozen if we were to dawdle about as you gentlemen do,\"\nand then she stopped and shook hands with him. She forgot at the\nmoment that Lucy and he had not met, and therefore she did not\nintroduce them.\n\n\"Won't you make me known to your sister-in-law?\" said he, taking off\nhis hat, and bowing to Lucy. \"I have never yet had the pleasure of\nmeeting her, though we have been neighbours for a month and more.\"\n\nFanny made her excuses and introduced them, and then they went on\ntill they came to Framley Gate, Lord Lufton talking to them both, and\nFanny answering for the two, and there they stopped for a moment.\n\n\"I am surprised to see you alone,\" Mrs. Robarts had just said; \"I\nthought that Captain Culpepper was with you.\"\n\n\"The captain has left me for this one day. If you'll whisper I'll\ntell you where he has gone. I dare not speak it out loud, even to the\nwoods.\"\n\n\"To what terrible place can he have taken himself? I'll have no\nwhisperings about such horrors.\"\n\n\"He has gone to--to--but you'll promise not to tell my mother?\"\n\n\"Not tell your mother! Well, now you have excited my curiosity! where\ncan he be?\"\n\n\"Do you promise, then?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes! I will promise, because I am sure Lady Lufton won't ask me\nas to Captain Culpepper's whereabouts. We won't tell; will we, Lucy?\"\n\n\"He has gone to Gatherum Castle for a day's pheasant-shooting. Now,\nmind, you must not betray us. Her ladyship supposes that he is shut\nup in his room with a toothache. We did not dare to mention the name\nto her.\"\n\nAnd then it appeared that Mrs. Robarts had some engagement which made\nit necessary that she should go up and see Lady Lufton, whereas Lucy\nwas intending to walk on to the parsonage alone.\n\n\"And I have promised to go to your husband,\" said Lord Lufton; \"or\nrather to your husband's dog, Ponto. And I will do two other good\nthings--I will carry a brace of pheasants with me, and protect Miss\nRobarts from the evil spirits of the Framley roads.\" And so Mrs.\nRobarts turned in at the gate, and Lucy and his lordship walked off\ntogether.\n\nLord Lufton, though he had never before spoken to Miss Robarts, had\nalready found out that she was by no means plain. Though he had\nhardly seen her except at church, he had already made himself certain\nthat the owner of that face must be worth knowing, and was not sorry\nto have the present opportunity of speaking to her. \"So you have\nan unknown damsel shut up in your castle,\" he had once said to Mrs.\nRobarts. \"If she be kept a prisoner much longer, I shall find it my\nduty to come and release her by force of arms.\" He had been there\ntwice with the object of seeing her, but on both occasions Lucy had\nmanaged to escape. Now we may say she was fairly caught, and Lord\nLufton, taking a pair of pheasants from the gamekeeper, and swinging\nthem over his shoulder, walked off with his prey.\n\n\n[Illustration: Lord Lufton and Lucy Robarts.]\n\n\n\"You have been here a long time,\" he said, \"without our having had\nthe pleasure of seeing you.\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord,\" said Lucy. Lords had not been frequent among her\nacquaintance hitherto.\n\n\"I tell Mrs. Robarts that she has been confining you illegally, and\nthat we shall release you by force or stratagem.\"\n\n\"I--I--I have had a great sorrow lately.\"\n\n\"Yes, Miss Robarts; I know you have; and I am only joking, you know.\nBut I do hope that now you will be able to come amongst us. My mother\nis so anxious that you should do so.\"\n\n\"I am sure she is very kind, and you also--my lord.\"\n\n\"I never knew my own father,\" said Lord Lufton, speaking gravely.\n\"But I can well understand what a loss you have had.\" And then, after\npausing a moment, he continued, \"I remember Dr. Robarts well.\"\n\n\"Do you, indeed?\" said Lucy, turning sharply towards him, and\nspeaking now with some animation in her voice. Nobody had yet spoken\nto her about her father since she had been at Framley. It had been as\nthough the subject were a forbidden one. And how frequently is this\nthe case! When those we love are dead, our friends dread to mention\nthem, though to us who are bereaved no subject would be so pleasant\nas their names. But we rarely understand how to treat our own sorrow\nor those of others.\n\nThere was once a people in some land--and they may be still there\nfor what I know--who thought it sacrilegious to stay the course of a\nraging fire. If a house were being burned, burn it must, even though\nthere were facilities for saving it. For who would dare to interfere\nwith the course of the god? Our idea of sorrow is much the same. We\nthink it wicked, or at any rate heartless, to put it out. If a man's\nwife be dead, he should go about lugubrious, with long face, for at\nleast two years, or perhaps with full length for eighteen months,\ndecreasing gradually during the other six. If he be a man who can\nquench his sorrow--put out his fire as it were--in less time than\nthat, let him at any rate not show his power!\n\n\"Yes: I remember him,\" continued Lord Lufton. \"He came twice to\nFramley while I was a boy, consulting with my mother about Mark and\nmyself,--whether the Eton floggings were not more efficacious than\nthose at Harrow. He was very kind to me, foreboding all manner of\ngood things on my behalf.\"\n\n\"He was very kind to every one,\" said Lucy.\n\n\"I should think he would have been--a kind, good, genial man--just\nthe man to be adored by his own family.\"\n\n\"Exactly; and so he was. I do not remember that I ever heard an\nunkind word from him. There was not a harsh tone in his voice. And\nhe was generous as the day.\" Lucy, we have said, was not generally\ndemonstrative, but now, on this subject, and with this absolute\nstranger, she became almost eloquent.\n\n\"I do not wonder that you should feel his loss, Miss Robarts.\"\n\n\"Oh, I do feel it. Mark is the best of brothers, and, as for Fanny,\nshe is too kind and too good to me. But I had always been specially\nmy father's friend. For the last year or two we had lived so much\ntogether!\"\n\n\"He was an old man when he died, was he not?\"\n\n\"Just seventy, my lord.\"\n\n\"Ah, then he was old. My mother is only fifty, and we sometimes call\nher the old woman. Do you think she looks older than that? We all say\nthat she makes herself out to be so much more ancient than she need\ndo.\"\n\n\"Lady Lufton does not dress young.\"\n\n\"That is it. She never has, in my memory. She always used to wear\nblack when I first recollect her. She has given that up now; but she\nis still very sombre; is she not?\"\n\n\"I do not like ladies to dress very young, that is, ladies of--of--\"\n\n\"Ladies of fifty, we will say?\"\n\n\"Very well; ladies of fifty, if you like it.\"\n\n\"Then I am sure you will like my mother.\"\n\nThey had now turned up through the parsonage wicket, a little gate\nthat opened into the garden at a point on the road nearer than the\nchief entrance.\n\n\"I suppose I shall find Mark up at the house?\" said he.\n\n\"I daresay you will, my lord.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll go round this way, for my business is partly in the\nstable. You see I am quite at home here, though you never have seen\nme before. But, Miss Robarts, now that the ice is broken, I hope that\nwe may be friends.\" He then put out his hand, and when she gave him\nhers he pressed it almost as an old friend might have done.\n\nAnd, indeed, Lucy had talked to him almost as though he were an old\nfriend. For a minute or two she had forgotten that he was a lord and\na stranger--had forgotten also to be stiff and guarded as was her\nwont. Lord Lufton had spoken to her as though he had really cared to\nknow her; and she, unconsciously, had been taken by the compliment.\nLord Lufton, indeed, had not thought much about it--excepting as\nthus, that he liked the glance of a pair of bright eyes, as most\nother young men do like it. But, on this occasion, the evening had\nbeen so dark, that he had hardly seen Lucy's eyes at all.\n\n\"Well, Lucy, I hope you liked your companion,\" Mrs. Robarts said,\nas the three of them clustered round the drawing-room fire before\ndinner.\n\n\"Oh, yes; pretty well,\" said Lucy.\n\n\"That is not at all complimentary to his lordship.\"\n\n\"I did not mean to be complimentary, Fanny.\"\n\n\"Lucy is a great deal too matter-of-fact for compliments,\" said Mark.\n\n\"What I meant was, that I had no great opportunity for judging,\nseeing that I was only with Lord Lufton for about ten minutes.\"\n\n\"Ah! but there are girls here who would give their eyes for ten\nminutes of Lord Lufton to themselves. You do not know how he's\nvalued. He has the character of being always able to make himself\nagreeable to ladies at half a minute's warning.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he had not the half-minute's warning in this case,\" said\nLucy,--hypocrite that she was.\n\n\"Poor Lucy,\" said her brother; \"he was coming up to see Ponto's\nshoulder, and I am afraid he was thinking more about the dog than\nyou.\"\n\n\"Very likely,\" said Lucy; and then they went in to dinner.\n\nLucy had been a hypocrite, for she had confessed to herself, while\ndressing, that Lord Lufton had been very pleasant; but then it is\nallowed to young ladies to be hypocrites when the subject under\ndiscussion is the character of a young gentleman.\n\nSoon after that, Lucy did dine at Framley Court. Captain Culpepper,\nin spite of his enormity with reference to Gatherum Castle, was still\nstaying there, as was also a clergyman from the neighbourhood of\nBarchester with his wife and daughter. This was Archdeacon Grantly,\na gentleman whom we have mentioned before, and who was as well known\nin the diocese as the bishop himself,--and more thought about by many\nclergymen than even that illustrious prelate.\n\nMiss Grantly was a young lady not much older than Lucy Robarts,\nand she also was quiet, and not given to much talking in open\ncompany. She was decidedly a beauty, but somewhat statuesque in her\nloveliness. Her forehead was high and white, but perhaps too like\nmarble to gratify the taste of those who are fond of flesh and blood.\nHer eyes were large and exquisitely formed, but they seldom showed\nmuch emotion. She, indeed, was impassive herself, and betrayed but\nlittle of her feelings. Her nose was nearly Grecian, not coming\nabsolutely in a straight line from her forehead, but doing so nearly\nenough to entitle it to be considered as classical. Her mouth, too,\nwas very fine--artists, at least, said so, and connoisseurs in\nbeauty; but to me she always seemed as though she wanted fulness of\nlip. But the exquisite symmetry of her cheek and chin and lower face\nno man could deny. Her hair was light, and being always dressed with\nconsiderable care, did not detract from her appearance; but it lacked\nthat richness which gives such luxuriance to feminine loveliness. She\nwas tall and slight, and very graceful in her movements; but there\nwere those who thought that she wanted the ease and _abandon_ of\nyouth. They said that she was too composed and stiff for her age, and\nthat she gave but little to society beyond the beauty of her form and\nface.\n\nThere can be no doubt, however, that she was considered by most men\nand women to be the beauty of Barsetshire, and that gentlemen from\nneighbouring counties would come many miles through dirty roads on\nthe mere hope of being able to dance with her. Whatever attractions\nshe may have lacked, she had at any rate created for herself a great\nreputation. She had spent two months of the last spring in London,\nand even there she had made a sensation; and people had said that\nLord Dumbello, Lady Hartletop's eldest son, had been peculiarly\nstruck with her.\n\nIt may be imagined that the archdeacon was proud of her, and so\nindeed was Mrs. Grantly--more proud, perhaps, of her daughter's\nbeauty, than so excellent a woman should have allowed herself to be\nof such an attribute. Griselda--that was her name--was now an only\ndaughter. One sister she had had, but that sister had died. There\nwere two brothers also left, one in the Church and the other in the\narmy. That was the extent of the archdeacon's family, and as the\narchdeacon was a very rich man--he was the only child of his father,\nwho had been Bishop of Barchester for a great many years; and\nin those years it had been worth a man's while to be Bishop of\nBarchester--it was supposed that Miss Grantly would have a large\nfortune. Mrs. Grantly, however, had been heard to say, that she was\nin no hurry to see her daughter established in the world;--ordinary\nyoung ladies are merely married, but those of real importance are\nestablished:--and this, if anything, added to the value of the prize.\nMothers sometimes depreciate their wares by an undue solicitude to\ndispose of them.\n\nBut to tell the truth openly and at once--a virtue for which a\nnovelist does not receive very much commendation--Griselda Grantly\nwas, to a certain extent, already given away. Not that she, Griselda,\nknew anything about it, or that the thrice happy gentleman had been\nmade aware of his good fortune; nor even had the archdeacon been\ntold. But Mrs. Grantly and Lady Lufton had been closeted together\nmore than once, and terms had been signed and sealed between them.\nNot signed on parchment, and sealed with wax, as is the case with\ntreaties made by kings and diplomats,--to be broken by the same; but\nsigned with little words, and sealed with certain pressings of the\nhand,--a treaty which between two such contracting parties would be\nbinding enough. And by the terms of this treaty Griselda Grantly was\nto become Lady Lufton.\n\nLady Lufton had hitherto been fortunate in her matrimonial\nspeculations. She had selected Sir George for her daughter, and Sir\nGeorge, with the utmost good nature, had fallen in with her views.\nShe had selected Fanny Monsell for Mr. Robarts, and Fanny Monsell\nhad not rebelled against her for a moment. There was a prestige of\nsuccess about her doings, and she felt almost confident that her dear\nson Ludovic must fall in love with Griselda.\n\nAs to the lady herself, nothing, Lady Lufton thought, could be much\nbetter than such a match for her son. Lady Lufton, I have said, was a\ngood churchwoman, and the archdeacon was the very type of that branch\nof the Church which she venerated. The Grantlys, too, were of a good\nfamily,--not noble, indeed; but in such matters Lady Lufton did not\nwant everything. She was one of those persons who, in placing their\nhopes at a moderate pitch, may fairly trust to see them realized. She\nwould fain that her son's wife should be handsome; this she wished\nfor his sake, that he might be proud of his wife, and because men\nlove to look on beauty. But she was afraid of vivacious beauty,\nof those soft, sparkling feminine charms which are spread out as\nlures for all the world, soft dimples, laughing eyes, luscious lips,\nconscious smiles, and easy whispers. What if her son should bring her\nhome a rattling, rapid-spoken, painted piece of Eve's flesh such as\nthis? Would not the glory and joy of her life be over, even though\nsuch child of their first mother should have come forth to the\npresent day ennobled by the blood of two dozen successive British\npeers?\n\nAnd then, too, Griselda's money would not be useless. Lady Lufton,\nwith all her high-flown ideas, was not an imprudent woman. She knew\nthat her son had been extravagant, though she did not believe that he\nhad been reckless; and she was well content to think that some balsam\nfrom the old bishop's coffers should be made to cure the slight\nwounds which his early imprudence might have inflicted on the carcase\nof the family property. And thus, in this way, and for these reasons,\nGriselda Grantly had been chosen out from all the world to be the\nfuture Lady Lufton.\n\nLord Lufton had met Griselda more than once already; had met\nher before these high contracting parties had come to any terms\nwhatsoever, and had evidently admired her. Lord Dumbello had remained\nsilent one whole evening in London with ineffable disgust, because\nLord Lufton had been rather particular in his attentions; but then\nLord Dumbello's muteness was his most eloquent mode of expression.\nBoth Lady Hartletop and Mrs. Grantly, when they saw him, knew very\nwell what he meant. But that match would not exactly have suited Mrs.\nGrantly's views. The Hartletop people were not in her line. They\nbelonged altogether to another set, being connected, as we have heard\nbefore, with the Omnium interest--\"those _horrid_ Gatherum people,\"\nas Lady Lufton would say to her, raising her hands and eyebrows, and\nshaking her head. Lady Lufton probably thought that they ate babies\nin pies during their midnight orgies at Gatherum Castle; and that\nwidows were kept in cells, and occasionally put on racks for the\namusement of the duke's guests.\n\nWhen the Robarts's party entered the drawing-room the Grantlys were\nalready there, and the archdeacon's voice sounded loud and imposing\nin Lucy's ears, as she heard him speaking while she was yet on the\nthreshold of the door.\n\n\"My dear Lady Lufton, I would believe anything on earth about\nher--anything. There is nothing too outrageous for her. Had she\ninsisted on going there with the bishop's apron on, I should not\nhave been surprised.\" And then they all knew that the archdeacon was\ntalking about Mrs. Proudie, for Mrs. Proudie was his bugbear.\n\nLady Lufton after receiving her guests introduced Lucy to Griselda\nGrantly. Miss Grantly smiled graciously, bowed slightly, and then\nremarked in the lowest voice possible that it was exceedingly cold.\nA low voice, we know, is an excellent thing in woman.\n\nLucy, who thought that she was bound to speak, said that it was cold,\nbut that she did not mind it when she was walking. And then Griselda\nsmiled again, somewhat less graciously than before, and so the\nconversation ended. Miss Grantly was the elder of the two, and having\nseen most of the world, should have been the best able to talk,\nbut perhaps she was not very anxious for a conversation with Miss\nRobarts.\n\n\"So, Robarts, I hear that you have been preaching at Chaldicotes,\"\nsaid the archdeacon, still rather loudly. \"I saw Sowerby the other\nday, and he told me that you gave them the fag end of Mrs. Proudie's\nlecture.\"\n\n\"It was ill-natured of Sowerby to say the fag end,\" said Robarts. \"We\ndivided the matter into thirds. Harold Smith took the first part, I\nthe last--\"\n\n\"And the lady the intervening portion. You have electrified the\ncounty between you; but I am told that she had the best of it.\"\n\n\"I was so sorry that Mr. Robarts went there,\" said Lady Lufton, as\nshe walked into the dining-room leaning on the archdeacon's arm.\n\n\"I am inclined to think he could not very well have helped himself,\"\nsaid the archdeacon, who was never willing to lean heavily on a\nbrother parson, unless on one who had utterly and irrevocably gone\naway from his side of the Church.\n\n\"Do you think not, archdeacon?\"\n\n\"Why, no: Sowerby is a friend of Lufton's--\"\n\n\"Not particularly,\" said poor Lady Lufton, in a deprecating tone.\n\n\"Well, they have been intimate; and Robarts, when he was asked to\npreach at Chaldicotes, could not well refuse.\"\n\n\"But then he went afterwards to Gatherum Castle. Not that I am vexed\nwith him at all now, you understand. But it is such a dangerous\nhouse, you know.\"\n\n\"So it is.--But the very fact of the duke's wishing to have a\nclergyman there, should always be taken as a sign of grace, Lady\nLufton. The air was impure, no doubt; but it was less impure with\nRobarts there than it would have been without him. But, gracious\nheavens! what blasphemy have I been saying about impure air? Why, the\nbishop was there!\"\n\n\"Yes, the bishop was there,\" said Lady Lufton, and they both\nunderstood each other thoroughly.\n\nLord Lufton took out Mrs. Grantly to dinner, and matters were so\nmanaged that Miss Grantly sat on his other side. There was no\nmanagement apparent in this to anybody; but there she was, while\nLucy was placed between her brother and Captain Culpepper. Captain\nCulpepper was a man with an enormous moustache, and a great aptitude\nfor slaughtering game; but as he had no other strong characteristics,\nit was not probable that he would make himself very agreeable to poor\nLucy.\n\nShe had seen Lord Lufton once, for two minutes, since the day of that\nwalk, and then he had addressed her quite like an old friend. It had\nbeen in the parsonage drawing-room, and Fanny had been there. Fanny\nnow was so well accustomed to his lordship, that she thought but\nlittle of this, but to Lucy it had been very pleasant. He was not\nforward or familiar, but kind, and gentle, and pleasant; and Lucy did\nfeel that she liked him.\n\nNow, on this evening, he had hitherto hardly spoken to her; but then\nshe knew that there were other people in the company to whom he was\nbound to speak. She was not exactly humble-minded in the usual sense\nof the word; but she did recognize the fact that her position was\nless important than that of other people there, and that therefore\nit was probable that to a certain extent she would be overlooked.\nBut not the less would she have liked to occupy the seat to which\nMiss Grantly had found her way. She did not want to flirt with Lord\nLufton; she was not such a fool as that; but she would have liked to\nhave heard the sound of his voice close to her ear, instead of that\nof Captain Culpepper's knife and fork.\n\nThis was the first occasion on which she had endeavoured to dress\nherself with care since her father had died; and now, sombre though\nshe was in her deep mourning, she did look very well.\n\n\"There is an expression about her forehead that is full of poetry,\"\nFanny had said to her husband.\n\n\"Don't you turn her head, Fanny, and make her believe that she is a\nbeauty,\" Mark had answered.\n\n\"I doubt it is not so easy to turn her head, Mark. There is more in\nLucy than you imagine, and so you will find out before long.\" It was\nthus that Mrs. Robarts prophesied about her sister-in-law. Had she\nbeen asked she might perhaps have said that Lucy's presence would be\ndangerous to the Grantly interest at Framley Court.\n\nLord Lufton's voice was audible enough as he went on talking to Miss\nGrantly--his voice, but not his words. He talked in such a way that\nthere was no appearance of whispering, and yet the person to whom he\nspoke, and she only, could hear what he said. Mrs. Grantly the while\nconversed constantly with Lucy's brother, who sat at Lucy's left\nhand. She never lacked for subjects on which to speak to a country\nclergyman of the right sort, and thus Griselda was left quite\nuninterrupted.\n\nBut Lucy could not but observe that Griselda herself seemed to have\nvery little to say,--or at any rate to say very little. Every now and\nthen she did open her mouth, and some word or brace of words would\nfall from it. But for the most part she seemed to be content in\nthe fact that Lord Lufton was paying her attention. She showed no\nanimation, but sat there still and graceful, composed and classical,\nas she always was. Lucy, who could not keep her ears from listening\nor her eyes from looking, thought that had she been there she would\nhave endeavoured to take a more prominent part in the conversation.\nBut then Griselda Grantly probably knew much better than Lucy did\nhow to comport herself in such a situation. Perhaps it might be that\nyoung men, such as Lord Lufton, liked to hear the sound of their own\nvoices.\n\n\"Immense deal of game about here,\" Captain Culpepper said to her\ntowards the end of the dinner. It was the second attempt he had made;\non the former he had asked her whether she knew any of the fellows of\nthe 9th.\n\n\"Is there?\" said Lucy. \"Oh! I saw Lord Lufton the other day with a\ngreat armful of pheasants.\"\n\n\"An armful! Why we had seven cartloads the other day at Gatherum.\"\n\n\"Seven carts full of pheasants!\" said Lucy, amazed.\n\n\"That's not so much. We had eight guns, you know. Eight guns will do\na deal of work when the game has been well got together. They manage\nall that capitally at Gatherum. Been at the duke's, eh?\"\n\nLucy had heard the Framley report as to Gatherum Castle, and said\nwith a sort of shudder that she had never been at that place. After\nthis, Captain Culpepper troubled her no further.\n\nWhen the ladies had taken themselves to the drawing-room Lucy found\nherself hardly better off than she had been at the dinner-table. Lady\nLufton and Mrs. Grantly got themselves on to a sofa together, and\nthere chatted confidentially into each other's ears. Her ladyship\nhad introduced Lucy and Miss Grantly, and then she naturally thought\nthat the young people might do very well together. Mrs. Robarts did\nattempt to bring about a joint conversation, which should include the\nthree, and for ten minutes or so she worked hard at it. But it did\nnot thrive. Miss Grantly was monosyllabic, smiling, however, at every\nmonosyllable; and Lucy found that nothing would occur to her at that\nmoment worthy of being spoken. There she sat, still and motionless,\nafraid to take up a book, and thinking in her heart how much happier\nshe would have been at home at the parsonage. She was not made for\nsociety; she felt sure of that; and another time she would let Mark\nand Fanny come to Framley Court by themselves.\n\nAnd then the gentlemen came in, and there was another stir in the\nroom. Lady Lufton got up and bustled about; she poked the fire and\nshifted the candles, spoke a few words to Dr. Grantly, whispered\nsomething to her son, patted Lucy on the cheek, told Fanny, who was a\nmusician, that they would have a little music, and ended by putting\nher two hands on Griselda's shoulders and telling her that the fit\nof her frock was perfect. For Lady Lufton, though she did dress old\nherself, as Lucy had said, delighted to see those around her neat and\npretty, jaunty and graceful.\n\n\"Dear Lady Lufton!\" said Griselda, putting up her hand so as to\npress the end of her ladyship's fingers. It was the first piece of\nanimation she had shown, and Lucy Robarts watched it all.\n\nAnd then there was music. Lucy neither played nor sang; Fanny did\nboth, and for an amateur did both well. Griselda did not sing, but\nshe played; and did so in a manner that showed that neither her own\nlabour nor her father's money had been spared in her instruction.\nLord Lufton sang also, a little, and Captain Culpepper a very little;\nso that they got up a concert among them. In the meantime the doctor\nand Mark stood talking together on the rug before the fire; the two\nmothers sat contented, watching the billings and the cooings of their\noffspring--and Lucy sat alone, turning over the leaves of a book of\npictures. She made up her mind fully, then and there, that she was\nquite unfitted by disposition for such work as this. She cared for\nno one, and no one cared for her. Well, she must go through with it\nnow; but another time she would know better. With her own book and a\nfireside she never felt herself to be miserable as she was now.\n\nShe had turned her back to the music, for she was sick of seeing\nLord Lufton watch the artistic motion of Miss Grantly's fingers, and\nwas sitting at a small table as far away from the piano as a long\nroom would permit, when she was suddenly roused from a reverie of\nself-reproach by a voice close behind her: \"Miss Robarts,\" said the\nvoice, \"why have you cut us all?\" and Lucy felt that though she heard\nthe words plainly, nobody else did. Lord Lufton was now speaking to\nher as he had before spoken to Miss Grantly.\n\n\"I don't play, my lord,\" said Lucy, \"nor yet sing.\"\n\n\"That would have made your company so much more valuable to us, for\nwe are terribly badly off for listeners. Perhaps you don't like\nmusic?\"\n\n\"I do like it,--sometimes very much.\"\n\n\"And when are the sometimes? But we shall find it all out in time. We\nshall have unravelled all your mysteries, and read all your riddles,\nby--when shall I say?--by the end of the winter. Shall we not?\"\n\n\"I do not know that I have got any mysteries.\"\n\n\"Oh, but you have! It is very mysterious in you to come and sit here,\nwith your back to us all--\"\n\n\"Oh, Lord Lufton; if I have done wrong--!\" and poor Lucy almost\nstarted from her chair, and a deep flush came across her dark cheek.\n\n\"No--no; you have done no wrong. I was only joking. It is we who have\ndone wrong in leaving you to yourself--you who are the greatest\nstranger among us.\"\n\n\"I have been very well, thank you. I don't care about being left\nalone. I have always been used to it.\"\n\n\"Ah! but we must break you of the habit. We won't allow you to make a\nhermit of yourself. But the truth is, Miss Robarts, you don't know us\nyet, and therefore you are not quite happy among us.\"\n\n\"Oh! yes, I am; you are all very good to me.\"\n\n\"You must let us be good to you. At any rate, you must let me be so.\nYou know, don't you, that Mark and I have been dear friends since we\nwere seven years old. His wife has been my sister's dearest friend\nalmost as long; and now that you are with them, you must be a dear\nfriend too. You won't refuse the offer; will you?\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" she said, quite in a whisper; and, indeed, she could hardly\nraise her voice above a whisper, fearing that tears would fall from\nher tell-tale eyes.\n\n\"Dr. and Mrs. Grantly will have gone in a couple of days, and then we\nmust get you down here. Miss Grantly is to remain for Christmas, and\nyou two must become bosom friends.\"\n\nLucy smiled, and tried to look pleased, but she felt that she and\nGriselda Grantly could never be bosom friends--could never have\nanything in common between them. She felt sure that Griselda despised\nher, little, brown, plain, and unimportant as she was. She herself\ncould not despise Griselda in turn; indeed she could not but admire\nMiss Grantly's great beauty and dignity of demeanour; but she knew\nthat she could never love her. It is hardly possible that the\nproud-hearted should love those who despise them; and Lucy Robarts\nwas very proud-hearted.\n\n\"Don't you think she is very handsome?\" said Lord Lufton.\n\n\"Oh, very,\" said Lucy. \"Nobody can doubt that.\"\n\n\"Ludovic,\" said Lady Lufton--not quite approving of her son's\nremaining so long at the back of Lucy's chair--\"won't you give us\nanother song? Mrs. Robarts and Miss Grantly are still at the piano.\"\n\n\"I have sung away all that I knew, mother. There's Culpepper has not\nhad a chance yet. He has got to give us his dream--how he 'dreamt\nthat he dwelt in marble halls!'\"\n\n\"I sang that an hour ago,\" said the captain, not over pleased.\n\n\"But you certainly have not told us how 'your little lovers came!'\"\n\nThe captain, however, would not sing any more. And then the party was\nbroken up, and the Robartses went home to their parsonage.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nTHE LITTLE BILL.\n\n\nLucy, during those last fifteen minutes of her sojourn in the Framley\nCourt drawing-room, somewhat modified the very strong opinion she\nhad before formed as to her unfitness for such society. It was very\npleasant sitting there in that easy chair, while Lord Lufton stood at\nthe back of it saying nice, soft, good-natured words to her. She was\nsure that in a little time she could feel a true friendship for him,\nand that she could do so without any risk of falling in love with\nhim. But then she had a glimmering of an idea that such a friendship\nwould be open to all manner of remarks, and would hardly be\ncompatible with the world's ordinary ways. At any rate it would be\npleasant to be at Framley Court, if he would come and occasionally\nnotice her. But she did not admit to herself that such a visit would\nbe intolerable if his whole time were devoted to Griselda Grantly.\nShe neither admitted it, nor thought it; but nevertheless, in a\nstrange unconscious way, such a feeling did find entrance in her\nbosom.\n\nAnd then the Christmas holidays passed away. How much of this\nenjoyment fell to her share, and how much of this suffering she\nendured, we will not attempt accurately to describe. Miss Grantly\nremained at Framley Court up to Twelfth Night, and the Robartses\nalso spent most of the season at the house. Lady Lufton, no doubt,\nhad hoped that everything might have been arranged on this occasion\nin accordance with her wishes, but such had not been the case. Lord\nLufton had evidently admired Miss Grantly very much; indeed, he\nhad said so to his mother half-a-dozen times; but it may almost be\nquestioned whether the pleasure Lady Lufton derived from this was not\nmore than neutralized by an opinion he once put forward that Griselda\nGrantly wanted some of the fire of Lucy Robarts.\n\n\"Surely, Ludovic, you would never compare the two girls,\" said Lady\nLufton.\n\n\"Of course not. They are the very antipodes to each other. Miss\nGrantly would probably be more to my taste; but then I am wise enough\nto know that it is so because my taste is a bad taste.\"\n\n\"I know no man with a more accurate or refined taste in such\nmatters,\" said Lady Lufton. Beyond this she did not dare to go. She\nknew very well that her strategy would be vain should her son once\nlearn that she had a strategy. To tell the truth, Lady Lufton was\nbecoming somewhat indifferent to Lucy Robarts. She had been very kind\nto the little girl; but the little girl seemed hardly to appreciate\nthe kindness as she should do--and then Lord Lufton would talk to\nLucy, \"which was so unnecessary, you know;\" and Lucy had got into\na way of talking quite freely with Lord Lufton, having completely\ndropped that short, spasmodic, ugly exclamation of \"my lord.\"\n\nAnd so the Christmas festivities were at an end, and January wore\nitself away. During the greater part of this month Lord Lufton did\nnot remain at Framley, but was nevertheless in the county, hunting\nwith the hounds of both divisions, and staying at various houses. Two\nor three nights he spent at Chaldicotes; and one--let it only be told\nin an under voice--at Gatherum Castle! Of this he said nothing to\nLady Lufton. \"Why make her unhappy?\" as he said to Mark. But Lady\nLufton knew it, though she said not a word to him--knew it, and was\nunhappy. \"If he would only marry Griselda, there would be an end of\nthat danger,\" she said to herself.\n\nBut now we must go back for a while to the vicar and his little bill.\nIt will be remembered, that his first idea with reference to that\ntrouble, after the reading of his father's will, was to borrow the\nmoney from his brother John. John was down at Exeter at the time, and\nwas to stay one night at the parsonage on his way to London. Mark\nwould broach the matter to him on the journey, painful though it\nwould be to him to tell the story of his own folly to a brother\nso much younger than himself, and who had always looked up to him,\nclergyman and full-blown vicar as he was, with a deference greater\nthan that which such difference in age required.\n\nThe story was told, however; but was told all in vain, as Mark found\nout before he reached Framley. His brother John immediately declared\nthat he would lend him the money, of course--eight hundred, if\nhis brother wanted it. He, John, confessed that, as regarded the\nremaining two, he should like to feel the pleasure of immediate\npossession. As for interest, he would not take any--take interest\nfrom a brother! of course not. Well, if Mark made such a fuss about\nit, he supposed he must take it; but would rather not. Mark should\nhave his own way, and do just what he liked.\n\nThis was all very well, and Mark had fully made up his mind that his\nbrother should not be kept long out of his money. But then arose the\nquestion, how was that money to be reached? He, Mark, was executor,\nor one of the executors under his father's will, and, therefore, no\ndoubt, could put his hand upon it; but his brother wanted five months\nof being of age, and could not therefore as yet be put legally in\npossession of the legacy.\n\n\"That's a bore,\" said the assistant private secretary to the Lord\nPetty Bag, thinking, perhaps, as much of his own immediate wish for\nready cash as he did of his brother's necessities. Mark felt that it\nwas a bore, but there was nothing more to be done in that direction.\nHe must now find out how far the bankers could assist him.\n\nSome week or two after his return to Framley he went over to\nBarchester, and called there on a certain Mr. Forrest, the manager\nof one of the banks, with whom he was acquainted; and with many\ninjunctions as to secrecy told this manager the whole of his story.\nAt first he concealed the name of his friend Sowerby, but it soon\nappeared that no such concealment was of any avail. \"That's Sowerby,\nof course,\" said Mr. Forrest. \"I know you are intimate with him; and\nall his friends go through that, sooner or later.\"\n\nIt seemed to Mark as though Mr. Forrest made very light of the whole\ntransaction.\n\n\"I cannot possibly pay the bill when it falls due,\" said Mark.\n\n\"Oh, no, of course not,\" said Mr. Forrest. \"It's never very\nconvenient to hand out four hundred pounds at a blow. Nobody will\nexpect you to pay it!\"\n\n\"But I suppose I shall have to do it sooner or later?\"\n\n\"Well, that's as may be. It will depend partly on how you manage with\nSowerby, and partly on the hands it gets into. As the bill has your\nname on it, they'll have patience as long as the interest is paid,\nand the commissions on renewal. But no doubt it will have to be met\nsome day by somebody.\"\n\nMr. Forrest said that he was sure that the bill was not in\nBarchester; Mr. Sowerby would not, he thought, have brought it to a\nBarchester bank. The bill was probably in London, but doubtless would\nbe sent to Barchester for collection. \"If it comes in my way,\" said\nMr. Forrest, \"I will give you plenty of time, so that you may manage\nabout the renewal with Sowerby. I suppose he'll pay the expense of\ndoing that.\"\n\nMark's heart was somewhat lighter as he left the bank. Mr. Forrest\nhad made so little of the whole transaction that he felt himself\njustified in making little of it also. \"It may be as well,\" said he\nto himself, as he drove home, \"not to tell Fanny anything about it\ntill the three months have run round. I must make some arrangement\nthen.\" And in this way his mind was easier during the last of those\nthree months than it had been during the two former. That feeling\nof over-due bills, of bills coming due, of accounts overdrawn, of\ntradesmen unpaid, of general money cares, is very dreadful at first;\nbut it is astonishing how soon men get used to it. A load which would\ncrush a man at first becomes, by habit, not only endurable, but\neasy and comfortable to the bearer. The habitual debtor goes along\njaunty and with elastic step, almost enjoying the excitement of his\nembarrassments. There was Mr. Sowerby himself; who ever saw a cloud\non his brow? It made one almost in love with ruin to be in his\ncompany. And even now, already, Mark Robarts was thinking to himself\nquite comfortably about this bill;--how very pleasantly those bankers\nmanaged these things. Pay it! No; no one will be so unreasonable\nas to expect you to do that! And then Mr. Sowerby certainly was a\npleasant fellow, and gave a man something in return for his money. It\nwas still a question with Mark whether Lord Lufton had not been too\nhard on Sowerby. Had that gentleman fallen across his clerical friend\nat the present moment, he might no doubt have gotten from him an\nacceptance for another four hundred pounds.\n\nOne is almost inclined to believe that there is something pleasurable\nin the excitement of such embarrassments, as there is also in the\nexcitement of drink. But then, at last, the time does come when the\nexcitement is over, and when nothing but the misery is left. If there\nbe an existence of wretchedness on earth it must be that of the\nelderly, worn-out _rou\u00c3\u00a9_, who has run this race of debt and bills\nof accommodation and acceptances,--of what, if we were not in these\ndays somewhat afraid of good broad English, we might call lying and\nswindling, falsehood and fraud--and who, having ruined all whom he\nshould have loved, having burnt up every one who would trust him\nmuch, and scorched all who would trust him a little, is at last\nleft to finish his life with such bread and water as these men get,\nwithout one honest thought to strengthen his sinking heart, or one\nhonest friend to hold his shivering hand! If a man could only think\nof that, as he puts his name to the first little bill, as to which he\nis so good-naturedly assured that it can easily be renewed!\n\nWhen the three months had nearly run out, it so happened that Robarts\nmet his friend Sowerby. Mark had once or twice ridden with Lord\nLufton as far as the meet of the hounds, and may, perhaps, have gone\na field or two farther on some occasions. The reader must not think\nthat he had taken to hunting, as some parsons do; and it is singular\nenough that whenever they do so they always show a special aptitude\nfor the pursuit, as though hunting were an employment peculiarly\ncongenial with a cure of souls in the country. Such a thought would\ndo our vicar injustice. But when Lord Lufton would ask him what on\nearth could be the harm of riding along the roads to look at the\nhounds, he hardly knew what sensible answer to give his lordship. It\nwould be absurd to say that his time would be better employed at home\nin clerical matters, for it was notorious that he had not clerical\npursuits for the employment of half his time. In this way, therefore,\nhe had got into a habit of looking at the hounds, and keeping up his\nacquaintance in the county, meeting Lord Dumbello, Mr. Green Walker,\nHarold Smith, and other such like sinners; and on one such occasion,\nas the three months were nearly closing, he did meet Mr. Sowerby.\n\n\"Look here, Sowerby; I want to speak to you for half a moment. What\nare you doing about that bill?\"\n\n\"Bill--bill! what bill?--which bill? The whole bill, and nothing but\nthe bill. That seems to be the conversation now-a-days of all men,\nmorning, noon, and night.\"\n\n\"Don't you know the bill I signed for you for four hundred pounds?\"\n\n\"Did you, though? Was not that rather green of you?\"\n\nThis did seem strange to Mark. Could it really be the fact that\nMr. Sowerby had so many bills flying about that he had absolutely\nforgotten that occurrence in the Gatherum Castle bedroom? And then to\nbe called green by the very man whom he had obliged!\n\n\"Perhaps I was,\" said Mark, in a tone that showed that he was\nsomewhat piqued. \"But all the same I should be glad to know how it\nwill be taken up.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mark, what a ruffian you are to spoil my day's sport in this\nway. Any man but a parson would be too good a Christian for such\nintense cruelty. But let me see--four hundred pounds? Oh, yes--Tozer\nhas it.\"\n\n\"And what will Tozer do with it?\"\n\n\"Make money of it; whatever way he may go to work he will do that.\"\n\n\"But will Tozer bring it to me on the 20th?\"\n\n\"Oh, Lord, no! Upon my word, Mark, you are deliciously green. A cat\nwould as soon think of killing a mouse directly she got it into her\nclaws. But, joking apart, you need not trouble yourself. Maybe you\nwill hear no more about it; or, perhaps, which no doubt is more\nprobable, I may have to send it to you to be renewed. But you need do\nnothing till you hear from me or somebody else.\"\n\n\"Only do not let any one come down upon me for the money.\"\n\n\"There is not the slightest fear of that. Tally-ho, old fellow! He's\naway. Tally-ho! right over by Gossetts' barn. Come along, and never\nmind Tozer--'Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.'\" And away\nthey both went together, parson and member of Parliament.\n\nAnd then again on that occasion Mark went home with a sort of feeling\nthat the bill did not matter. Tozer would manage it somehow; and it\nwas quite clear that it would not do to tell his wife of it just at\npresent.\n\nOn the 21st of that month of February, however, he did receive a\nreminder that the bill and all concerning it had not merely been a\nfarce. This was a letter from Mr. Sowerby, dated from Chaldicotes,\nthough not bearing the Barchester post-mark, in which that gentleman\nsuggested a renewal--not exactly of the old bill, but of a new one.\nIt seemed to Mark that the letter had been posted in London. If I\ngive it entire, I shall, perhaps, most quickly explain its purport:\n\n\n   Chaldicotes,--20th February, 185--.\n\n   MY DEAR MARK,--\"Lend not thy name to the money-dealers,\n   for the same is a destruction and a snare.\" If that be\n   not in the Proverbs, it ought to be. Tozer has given me\n   certain signs of his being alive and strong this cold\n   weather. As we can neither of us take up that bill\n   for \u00c2\u00a3400 at the moment, we must renew it, and pay him\n   his commission and interest, with all the rest of his\n   perquisites, and pickings, and stealings--from all which,\n   I can assure you, Tozer does not keep his hands as he\n   should do.\n\n   To cover this and some other little outstanding trifles,\n   I have filled in the new bill for \u00c2\u00a3500, making it due\n   23rd of May next. Before that time, a certain accident\n   will, I trust, have occurred to your impoverished friend.\n   By-the-by, I never told you how she went off from Gatherum\n   Castle, the morning after you left us, with the Greshams.\n   Cart-ropes would not hold her, even though the duke held\n   them; which he did, with all the strength of his ducal\n   hands. She would go to meet some doctor of theirs, and so\n   I was put off for that time; but I think that the matter\n   stands in a good train.\n\n   Do not lose a post in sending back the bill accepted, as\n   Tozer may annoy you--nay, undoubtedly will, if the matter\n   be not in his hand, duly signed by both of us, the day\n   after to-morrow. He is an ungrateful brute; he has lived\n   on me for these eight years, and would not let me off a\n   single squeeze now to save my life. But I am specially\n   anxious to save you from the annoyance and cost of\n   lawyers' letters; and if delayed, it might get into the\n   papers.\n\n   Put it under cover to me, at No. 7, Duke Street, St.\n   James's. I shall be in town by that time.\n\n   Good-bye, old fellow. That was a decent brush we had the\n   other day from Cobbold's Ashes. I wish I could get that\n   brown horse from you. I would not mind going to a hundred\n   and thirty.\n\n   Yours ever,\n\n   N. SOWERBY.\n\n\nWhen Mark had read it through he looked down on his table to see\nwhether the old bill had fallen from the letter; but no, there was\nno enclosure, and had been no enclosure but the new bill. And then\nhe read the letter through again, and found that there was no word\nabout the old bill,--not a syllable, at least, as to its whereabouts.\nSowerby did not even say that it would remain in his own hands.\n\nMark did not in truth know much about such things. It might be that\nthe very fact of his signing this second document would render that\nfirst document null and void; and from Sowerby's silence on the\nsubject, it might be argued that this was so well known to be the\ncase, that he had not thought of explaining it. But yet Mark could\nnot see how this should be so.\n\nBut what was he to do? That threat of cost and lawyers, and specially\nof the newspapers, did have its effect upon him--as no doubt it was\nintended to do. And then he was utterly dumfounded by Sowerby's\nimpudence in drawing on him for \u00c2\u00a3500 instead of \u00c2\u00a3400, \"covering,\" as\nSowerby so good-humouredly said, \"sundry little outstanding trifles.\"\n\nBut at last he did sign the bill, and sent it off, as Sowerby had\ndirected. What else was he to do?\n\nFool that he was. A man always can do right, even though he has done\nwrong before. But that previous wrong adds so much difficulty to the\npath--a difficulty which increases in tremendous ratio, till a man at\nlast is choked in his struggling, and is drowned beneath the waters.\n\nAnd then he put away Sowerby's letter carefully, locking it up from\nhis wife's sight. It was a letter that no parish clergyman should\nhave received. So much he acknowledged to himself. But nevertheless\nit was necessary that he should keep it. And now again for a few\nhours this affair made him very miserable.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nDELICATE HINTS.\n\n\nLady Lufton had been greatly rejoiced at that good deed which her son\ndid in giving up his Leicestershire hunting, and coming to reside for\nthe winter at Framley. It was proper, and becoming, and comfortable\nin the extreme. An English nobleman ought to hunt in the county where\nhe himself owns the fields over which he rides; he ought to receive\nthe respect and honour due to him from his own tenants; he ought to\nsleep under a roof of his own, and he ought also--so Lady Lufton\nthought--to fall in love with a young embryo bride of his own\nmother's choosing.\n\nAnd then it was so pleasant to have him there in the house. Lady\nLufton was not a woman who allowed her life to be what people in\ncommon parlance call dull. She had too many duties, and thought too\nmuch of them, to allow of her suffering from tedium and _ennui_.\nBut nevertheless the house was more joyous to her when he was there.\nThere was a reason for some little gaiety, which would never have\nbeen attracted thither by herself, but which, nevertheless, she did\nenjoy when it was brought about by his presence. She was younger and\nbrighter when he was there, thinking more of the future and less of\nthe past. She could look at him, and that alone was happiness to her.\nAnd then he was pleasant-mannered with her; joking with her on her\nlittle old-world prejudices in a tone that was musical to her ear as\ncoming from him; smiling on her, reminding her of those smiles which\nshe had loved so dearly when as yet he was all her own, lying there\nin his little bed beside her chair. He was kind and gracious to her,\nbehaving like a good son, at any rate while he was there in her\npresence. When we add, to this, her fears that he might not be so\nperfect in his conduct when absent, we may well imagine that Lady\nLufton was pleased to have him there at Framley Court.\n\nShe had hardly said a word to him as to that five thousand pounds.\nMany a night, as she lay thinking on her pillow, she said to herself\nthat no money had ever been better expended, since it had brought him\nback to his own house. He had thanked her for it in his own open way,\ndeclaring that he would pay it back to her during the coming year,\nand comforting her heart by his rejoicing that the property had not\nbeen sold.\n\n\"I don't like the idea of parting with an acre of it,\" he had said.\n\n\"Of course not, Ludovic. Never let the estate decrease in your hands.\nIt is only by such resolutions as that that English noblemen and\nEnglish gentlemen can preserve their country. I cannot bear to see\nproperty changing hands.\"\n\n\"Well, I suppose it's a good thing to have land in the market\nsometimes, so that the millionnaires may know what to do with their\nmoney.\"\n\n\"God forbid that yours should be there!\" And the widow made a little\nmental prayer that her son's acres might be protected from the\nmillionnaires and other Philistines.\n\n\"Why, yes: I don't exactly want to see a Jew tailor investing his\nearnings at Lufton,\" said the lord.\n\n\"Heaven forbid!\" said the widow.\n\nAll this, as I have said, was very nice. It was manifest to her\nladyship, from his lordship's way of talking, that no vital injury\nhad as yet been done: he had no cares on his mind, and spoke freely\nabout the property: but nevertheless there were clouds even now, at\nthis period of bliss, which somewhat obscured the brilliancy of Lady\nLufton's sky. Why was Ludovic so slow in that affair of Griselda\nGrantly? why so often in these latter winter days did he saunter over\nto the parsonage? And then that terrible visit to Gatherum Castle!\n\nWhat actually did happen at Gatherum Castle, she never knew. We,\nhowever, are more intrusive, less delicate in our inquiries, and we\ncan say. He had a very bad day's sport with the West Barsetshire. The\ncounty is altogether short of foxes, and some one who understands\nthe matter must take that point up before they can do any good. And\nafter that he had had rather a dull dinner with the duke. Sowerby had\nbeen there, and in the evening he and Sowerby had played billiards.\nSowerby had won a pound or two, and that had been the extent of the\ndamage done.\n\nBut those saunterings over to the parsonage might be more dangerous.\nNot that it ever occurred to Lady Lufton as possible that her son\nshould fall in love with Lucy Robarts. Lucy's personal attractions\nwere not of a nature to give ground for such a fear as that. But he\nmight turn the girl's head with his chatter; she might be fool enough\nto fancy any folly; and, moreover, people would talk. Why should he\ngo to the parsonage now more frequently than he had ever done before\nLucy came there?\n\nAnd then her ladyship, in reference to the same trouble, hardly knew\nhow to manage her invitations to the parsonage. These hitherto had\nbeen very frequent, and she had been in the habit of thinking that\nthey could hardly be too much so; but now she was almost afraid\nto continue the custom. She could not ask the parson and his wife\nwithout Lucy; and when Lucy was there, her son would pass the greater\npart of the evening in talking to her, or playing chess with her. Now\nthis did disturb Lady Lufton not a little.\n\nAnd then Lucy took it all so quietly. On her first arrival at Framley\nshe had been so shy, so silent, and so much awestruck by the grandeur\nof Framley Court, that Lady Lufton had sympathized with her and\nencouraged her. She had endeavoured to moderate the blaze of her\nown splendour, in order that Lucy's unaccustomed eyes might not be\ndazzled. But all this was changed now. Lucy could listen to the young\nlord's voice by the hour together--without being dazzled in the\nleast.\n\nUnder these circumstances two things occurred to her. She would speak\neither to her son or to Fanny Robarts, and by a little diplomacy have\nthis evil remedied. And then she had to determine on which step she\nwould take.\n\n\"Nothing could be more reasonable than Ludovic.\" So at least she said\nto herself over and over again. But then Ludovic understood nothing\nabout such matters; and he had, moreover, a habit, inherited from his\nfather, of taking the bit between his teeth whenever he suspected\ninterference. Drive him gently without pulling his mouth about, and\nyou might take him anywhere, almost at any pace; but a smart touch,\nlet it be ever so slight, would bring him on his haunches, and then\nit might be a question whether you could get him another mile that\nday. So that on the whole Lady Lufton thought that the other plan\nwould be the best. I have no doubt that Lady Lufton was right.\n\nShe got Fanny up into her own den one afternoon, and seated her\ndiscreetly in an easy arm-chair, making her guest take off her\nbonnet, and showing by various signs that the visit was regarded as\none of great moment.\n\n\"Fanny,\" she said, \"I want to speak to you about something that is\nimportant and necessary to mention, and yet it is a very delicate\naffair to speak of.\" Fanny opened her eyes, and said that she hoped\nthat nothing was wrong.\n\n\"No, my dear, I think nothing is wrong: I hope so, and I think I may\nsay I'm sure of it; but then it's always well to be on one's guard.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is,\" said Fanny, who knew that something unpleasant was\ncoming--something as to which she might probably be called upon to\ndiffer from her ladyship. Mrs. Robarts' own fears, however, were\nrunning entirely in the direction of her husband;--and, indeed,\nLady Lufton had a word or two to say on that subject also, only not\nexactly now. A hunting parson was not at all to her taste; but that\nmatter might be allowed to remain in abeyance for a few days.\n\n\"Now, Fanny, you know that we have all liked your sister-in-law,\nLucy, very much.\" And then Mrs. Robarts' mind was immediately opened,\nand she knew the rest as well as though it had all been spoken. \"I\nneed hardly tell you that, for I am sure we have shown it.\"\n\n\"You have, indeed, as you always do.\"\n\n\"And you must not think that I am going to complain,\" continued Lady\nLufton.\n\n\"I hope there is nothing to complain of,\" said Fanny, speaking by\nno means in a defiant tone, but humbly as it were, and deprecating\nher ladyship's wrath. Fanny had gained one signal victory over Lady\nLufton, and on that account, with a prudence equal to her generosity,\nfelt that she could afford to be submissive. It might, perhaps, not\nbe long before she would be equally anxious to conquer again.\n\n\"Well, no; I don't think there is,\" said Lady Lufton. \"Nothing to\ncomplain of; but a little chat between you and me may, perhaps, set\nmatters right, which, otherwise, might become troublesome.\"\n\n\"Is it about Lucy?\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear--about Lucy. She is a very nice, good girl, and a\ncredit to her father--\"\n\n\"And a great comfort to us,\" said Fanny.\n\n\"I am sure she is: she must be a very pleasant companion to you, and\nso useful about the children; but--\" And then Lady Lufton paused for\na moment; for she, eloquent and discreet as she always was, felt\nherself rather at a loss for words to express her exact meaning.\n\n\"I don't know what I should do without her,\" said Fanny, speaking\nwith the object of assisting her ladyship in her embarrassment.\n\n\"But the truth is this: she and Lord Lufton are getting into the way\nof being too much together--of talking to each other too exclusively.\nI am sure you must have noticed it, Fanny. It is not that I suspect\nany evil. I don't think that I am suspicious by nature.\"\n\n\"Oh! no,\" said Fanny.\n\n\"But they will each of them get wrong ideas about the other, and\nabout themselves. Lucy will, perhaps, think that Ludovic means more\nthan he does, and Ludovic will--\" But it was not quite so easy to say\nwhat Ludovic might do or think; but Lady Lufton went on: \"I am sure\nthat you understand me, Fanny, with your excellent sense and tact.\nLucy is clever, and amusing, and all that; and Ludovic, like all\nyoung men, is perhaps ignorant that his attentions may be taken to\nmean more than he intends--\"\n\n\"You don't think that Lucy is in love with him?\"\n\n\"Oh dear, no--nothing of the kind. If I thought it had come to that,\nI should recommend that she should be sent away altogether. I am sure\nshe is not so foolish as that.\"\n\n\"I don't think there is anything in it at all, Lady Lufton.\"\n\n\"I don't think there is, my dear, and therefore I would not for\nworlds make any suggestion about it to Lord Lufton. I would not let\nhim suppose that I suspected Lucy of being so imprudent. But still,\nit may be well that you should just say a word to her. A little\nmanagement now and then, in such matters, is so useful.\"\n\n\"But what shall I say to her?\"\n\n\"Just explain to her that any young lady who talks so much to the\nsame young gentleman will certainly be observed--that people will\naccuse her of setting her cap at Lord Lufton. Not that I suspect\nher--I give her credit for too much proper feeling: I know her\neducation has been good, and her principles are upright. But people\nwill talk of her. You must understand that, Fanny, as well as I do.\"\n\nFanny could not help meditating whether proper feeling, education,\nand upright principles did forbid Lucy Robarts to fall in love with\nLord Lufton; but her doubts on this subject, if she held any, were\nnot communicated to her ladyship. It had never entered into her mind\nthat a match was possible between Lord Lufton and Lucy Robarts, nor\nhad she the slightest wish to encourage it now that the idea was\nsuggested to her. On such a matter she could sympathize with Lady\nLufton, though she did not completely agree with her as to the\nexpediency of any interference. Nevertheless, she at once offered to\nspeak to Lucy.\n\n\"I don't think that Lucy has any idea in her head upon the subject,\"\nsaid Mrs. Robarts.\n\n\"I dare say not--I don't suppose she has. But young ladies sometimes\nallow themselves to fall in love, and then to think themselves very\nill-used, just because they have had no idea in their head.\"\n\n\"I will put her on her guard if you wish it, Lady Lufton.\"\n\n\"Exactly, my dear; that is just it. Put her on her guard--that is all\nthat is necessary. She is a dear, good, clever girl, and it would be\nvery sad if anything were to interrupt our comfortable way of getting\non with her.\"\n\nMrs. Robarts knew to a nicety the exact meaning of this threat. If\nLucy would persist in securing to herself so much of Lord Lufton's\ntime and attention, her visits to Framley Court must become less\nfrequent. Lady Lufton would do much, very much, indeed, for her\nfriends at the parsonage; but not even for them could she permit her\nson's prospects in life to be endangered.\n\nThere was nothing more said between them, and Mrs. Robarts got up to\ntake her leave, having promised to speak to Lucy.\n\n\"You manage everything so perfectly,\" said Lady Lufton, as she\npressed Mrs. Robarts' hand, \"that I am quite at ease now that I find\nyou will agree with me.\" Mrs. Robarts did not exactly agree with her\nladyship, but she hardly thought it worth her while to say so.\n\nMrs. Robarts immediately started off on her walk to her own home, and\nwhen she had got out of the grounds into the road, where it makes a\nturn towards the parsonage, nearly opposite to Podgens' shop, she\nsaw Lord Lufton on horseback, and Lucy standing beside him. It was\nalready nearly five o'clock, and it was getting dusk; but as she\napproached, or rather as she came suddenly within sight of them, she\ncould see that they were in close conversation. Lord Lufton's face\nwas towards her, and his horse was standing still; he was leaning\nover towards his companion, and the whip, which he held in his right\nhand, hung almost over her arm and down her back, as though his hand\nhad touched and perhaps rested on her shoulder. She was standing by\nhis side, looking up into his face, with one gloved hand resting on\nthe horse's neck. Mrs. Robarts, as she saw them, could not but own\nthat there might be cause for Lady Lufton's fears.\n\nBut then Lucy's manner, as Mrs. Robarts approached, was calculated to\ndissipate any such fears, and to prove that there was no ground for\nthem. She did not move from her position, or allow her hand to drop,\nor show that she was in any way either confused or conscious. She\nstood her ground, and when her sister-in-law came up was smiling and\nat her ease.\n\n\"Lord Lufton wants me to learn to ride,\" said she.\n\n\"To learn to ride!\" said Fanny, not knowing what answer to make to\nsuch a proposition.\n\n\"Yes,\" said he. \"This horse would carry her beautifully: he is as\nquiet as a lamb, and I made Gregory go out with him yesterday with a\nsheet hanging over him like a lady's habit, and the man got up into a\nlady's saddle.\"\n\n\"I think Gregory would make a better hand of it than Lucy.\"\n\n\"The horse cantered with him as though he had carried a lady all his\nlife, and his mouth is like velvet; indeed, that is his fault--he is\ntoo soft-mouthed.\"\n\n\"I suppose that's the same sort of thing as a man being\nsoft-hearted,\" said Lucy.\n\n\"Exactly: you ought to ride them both with a very light hand. They\nare difficult cattle to manage, but very pleasant when you know how\nto do it.\"\n\n\"But you see I don't know how to do it,\" said Lucy.\n\n\"As regards the horse, you will learn in two days, and I do hope you\nwill try. Don't you think it will be an excellent thing for her, Mrs.\nRobarts?\"\n\n\"Lucy has got no habit,\" said Mrs. Robarts, making use of the excuse\ncommon on all such occasions.\n\n\"There is one of Justinia's in the house, I know. She always leaves\none here, in order that she may be able to ride when she comes.\"\n\n\"She would not think of taking such a liberty with Lady Meredith's\nthings,\" said Fanny, almost frightened at the proposal.\n\n\"Of course it is out of the question, Fanny,\" said Lucy, now speaking\nrather seriously. \"In the first place, I would not take Lord Lufton's\nhorse; in the second place, I would not take Lady Meredith's habit;\nin the third place, I should be a great deal too much frightened;\nand, lastly, it is quite out of the question for a great many other\nvery good reasons.\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" said Lord Lufton.\n\n\"A great deal of nonsense,\" said Lucy, laughing, \"but all of it\nof Lord Lufton's talking. But we are getting cold--are we not,\nFanny?--so we will wish you good-night.\" And then the two ladies\nshook hands with him, and walked on towards the parsonage.\n\nThat which astonished Mrs. Robarts the most in all this was the\nperfectly collected manner in which Lucy spoke and conducted herself.\nThis connected, as she could not but connect it, with the air of\nchagrin with which Lord Lufton received Lucy's decision, made it\nmanifest to Mrs. Robarts that Lord Lufton was annoyed because Lucy\nwould not consent to learn to ride; whereas she, Lucy herself, had\ngiven her refusal in a firm and decided tone, as though resolved that\nnothing more should be said about it.\n\nThey walked on in silence for a minute or two, till they reached the\nparsonage gate, and then Lucy said, laughing, \"Can't you fancy me\nsitting on that great big horse? I wonder what Lady Lufton would say\nif she saw me there, and his lordship giving me my first lesson?\"\n\n\"I don't think she would like it,\" said Fanny.\n\n\"I'm sure she would not. But I will not try her temper in that\nrespect. Sometimes I fancy that she does not even like seeing Lord\nLufton talking to me.\"\n\n\"She does not like it, Lucy, when she sees him flirting with you.\"\n\nThis Mrs. Robarts said rather gravely, whereas Lucy had been speaking\nin a half-bantering tone. As soon as even the word flirting was out\nof Fanny's mouth, she was conscious that she had been guilty of\nan injustice in using it. She had wished to say something which\nwould convey to her sister-in-law an idea of what Lady Lufton would\ndislike; but in doing so, she had unintentionally brought against her\nan accusation.\n\n\"Flirting, Fanny!\" said Lucy, standing still in the path, and looking\nup into her companion's face with all her eyes. \"Do you mean to say\nthat I have been flirting with Lord Lufton?\"\n\n\"I did not say that.\"\n\n\"Or that I have allowed him to flirt with me?\"\n\n\"I did not mean to shock you, Lucy.\"\n\n\"What did you mean, Fanny?\"\n\n\"Why, just this: that Lady Lufton would not be pleased if he paid you\nmarked attentions, and if you received them;--just like that affair\nof the riding; it was better to decline it.\"\n\n\"Of course I declined it; of course I never dreamt of accepting such\nan offer. Go riding about the country on his horses! What have I\ndone, Fanny, that you should suppose such a thing?\"\n\n\"You have done nothing, dearest.\"\n\n\"Then why did you speak as you did just now?\"\n\n\"Because I wished to put you on your guard. You know, Lucy, that I\ndo not intend to find fault with you; but you may be sure, as a rule,\nthat intimate friendships between young gentlemen and young ladies\nare dangerous things.\"\n\nThey then walked up to the hall-door in silence. When they had\nreached it, Lucy stood in the doorway instead of entering it, and\nsaid, \"Fanny, let us take another turn together, if you are not\ntired.\"\n\n\"No, I'm not tired.\"\n\n\"It will be better that I should understand you at once,\"--and then\nthey again moved away from the house. \"Tell me truly now, do you\nthink that Lord Lufton and I have been flirting?\"\n\n\"I do think that he is a little inclined to flirt with you.\"\n\n\"And Lady Lufton has been asking you to lecture me about it?\"\n\nPoor Mrs. Robarts hardly knew what to say. She thought well of all\nthe persons concerned, and was very anxious to behave well by all\nof them;--was particularly anxious to create no ill feeling, and\nwished that everybody should be comfortable, and on good terms with\neverybody else. But yet the truth was forced out of her when this\nquestion was asked so suddenly.\n\n\"Not to lecture you, Lucy,\" she said at last.\n\n\"Well, to preach to me, or to talk to me, or to give me a lesson;\nto say something that shall drive me to put my back up against Lord\nLufton?\"\n\n\"To caution you, dearest. Had you heard what she said, you would\nhardly have felt angry with Lady Lufton.\"\n\n\"Well, to caution me. It is such a pleasant thing for a girl to be\ncautioned against falling in love with a gentleman, especially when\nthe gentleman is very rich, and a lord, and all that sort of thing!\"\n\n\"Nobody for a moment attributes anything wrong to you, Lucy.\"\n\n\"Anything wrong--no. I don't know whether it would be anything wrong,\neven if I were to fall in love with him. I wonder whether they\ncautioned Griselda Grantly when she was here? I suppose when young\nlords go about, all the girls are cautioned as a matter of course.\nWhy do they not label him 'dangerous'?\" And then again they were\nsilent for a moment, as Mrs. Robarts did not feel that she had\nanything further to say on the matter.\n\n\"'Poison' should be the word with any one so fatal as Lord Lufton;\nand he ought to be made up of some particular colour, for fear he\nshould be swallowed in mistake.\"\n\n\"You will be safe, you see,\" said Fanny, laughing, \"as you have been\nspecially cautioned as to this individual bottle.\"\n\n\"Ah! but what's the use of that after I have had so many doses? It is\nno good telling me about it now, when the mischief is done,--after I\nhave been taking it for I don't know how long. Dear! dear! dear! and\nI regarded it as a mere commonplace powder, good for the complexion.\nI wonder whether it's too late, or whether there's any antidote?\"\n\nMrs. Robarts did not always quite understand her sister-in-law, and\nnow she was a little at a loss. \"I don't think there's much harm done\nyet on either side,\" she said, cheerily.\n\n\"Ah! you don't know, Fanny. But I do think that if I die--as I\nshall--I feel I shall;--and if so, I do think it ought to go very\nhard with Lady Lufton. Why didn't she label him 'dangerous' in time?\"\nAnd then they went into the house and up to their own rooms.\n\nIt was difficult for any one to understand Lucy's state of mind at\npresent, and it can hardly be said that she understood it herself.\nShe felt that she had received a severe blow in having been thus made\nthe subject of remark with reference to Lord Lufton. She knew that\nher pleasant evenings at Framley Court were now over, and that she\ncould not again talk to him in an unrestrained tone and without\nembarrassment. She had felt the air of the whole place to be very\ncold before her intimacy with him, and now it must be cold again.\nTwo homes had been open to her, Framley Court and the parsonage; and\nnow, as far as comfort was concerned, she must confine herself to\nthe latter. She could not again be comfortable in Lady Lufton's\ndrawing-room.\n\nBut then she could not help asking herself whether Lady Lufton was\nnot right. She had had courage enough, and presence of mind, to joke\nabout the matter when her sister-in-law spoke to her, and yet she\nwas quite aware that it was no joking matter. Lord Lufton had not\nabsolutely made love to her, but he had latterly spoken to her\nin a manner which she knew was not compatible with that ordinary\ncomfortable masculine friendship with the idea of which she had once\nsatisfied herself. Was not Fanny right when she said that intimate\nfriendships of that nature were dangerous things?\n\nYes, Lucy, very dangerous. Lucy, before she went to bed that night,\nhad owned to herself that they were so; and lying there with\nsleepless eyes and a moist pillow, she was driven to confess that the\nlabel would in truth be now too late, that the caution had come to\nher after the poison had been swallowed. Was there any antidote? That\nwas all that was left for her to consider. But, nevertheless, on the\nfollowing morning she could appear quite at her ease. And when Mark\nhad left the house after breakfast, she could still joke with Fanny\nas to Lady Lufton's poison cupboard.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nMR. CRAWLEY OF HOGGLESTOCK.\n\n\nAnd then there was that other trouble in Lady Lufton's mind, the\nsins, namely, of her selected parson. She had selected him, and she\nwas by no means inclined to give him up, even though his sins against\nparsondom were grievous. Indeed she was a woman not prone to give\nup anything, and of all things not prone to give up a _prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9_.\nThe very fact that she herself had selected him was the strongest\nargument in his favour.\n\nBut his sins against parsondom were becoming very grievous in her\neyes, and she was at a loss to know what steps to take. She hardly\ndared to take him to task, him himself. Were she to do so, and should\nhe then tell her to mind her own business--as he probably might do,\nthough not in those words--there would be a schism in the parish; and\nalmost anything would be better than that. The whole work of her life\nwould be upset, all the outlets of her energy would be impeded if not\nabsolutely closed, if a state of things were to come to pass in which\nshe and the parson of her parish should not be on good terms.\n\nBut what was to be done? Early in the winter he had gone to\nChaldicotes and to Gatherum Castle, consorting with gamblers, Whigs,\natheists, men of loose pleasure, and Proudieites. That she had\ncondoned; and now he was turning out a hunting parson on her hands.\nIt was all very well for Fanny to say that he merely looked at the\nhounds as he rode about his parish. Fanny might be deceived. Being\nhis wife, it might be her duty not to see her husband's iniquities.\nBut Lady Lufton could not be deceived. She knew very well in what\npart of the county Cobbold's Ashes lay. It was not in Framley\nparish, nor in the next parish to it. It was half-way across to\nChaldicotes--in the western division; and she had heard of that run\nin which two horses had been killed, and in which Parson Robarts had\nwon such immortal glory among West Barsetshire sportsmen. It was not\neasy to keep Lady Lufton in the dark as to matters occurring in her\nown county.\n\nAll these things she knew, but as yet had not noticed, grieving over\nthem in her own heart the more on that account. Spoken grief relieves\nitself; and when one can give counsel, one always hopes at least\nthat that counsel will be effective. To her son she had said, more\nthan once, that it was a pity that Mr. Robarts should follow the\nhounds.--\"The world has agreed that it is unbecoming in a clergyman,\"\nshe would urge, in her deprecatory tone. But her son would by no\nmeans give her any comfort. \"He doesn't hunt, you know--not as I do,\"\nhe would say. \"And if he did, I really don't see the harm of it. A\nman must have some amusement, even if he be an archbishop.\" \"He has\namusement at home,\" Lady Lufton would answer. \"What does his wife\ndo--and his sister?\" This allusion to Lucy, however, was very soon\ndropped.\n\nLord Lufton would in no wise help her. He would not even passively\ndiscourage the vicar, or refrain from offering to give him a seat in\ngoing to the meets. Mark and Lord Lufton had been boys together, and\nhis lordship knew that Mark in his heart would enjoy a brush across\nthe country quite as well as he himself; and then what was the harm\nof it?\n\nLady Lufton's best aid had been in Mark's own conscience. He had\ntaken himself to task more than once, and had promised himself that\nhe would not become a sporting parson. Indeed, where would be his\nhopes of ulterior promotion, if he allowed himself to degenerate\nso far as that? It had been his intention, in reviewing what he\nconsidered to be the necessary proprieties of clerical life, in\nlaying out his own future mode of living, to assume no peculiar\nsacerdotal strictness; he would not be known as a denouncer of\ndancing or of card-tables, of theatres or of novel-reading; he would\ntake the world around him as he found it, endeavouring by precept\nand practice to lend a hand to the gradual amelioration which\nChristianity is producing; but he would attempt no sudden or majestic\nreforms. Cake and ale would still be popular, and ginger be hot in\nthe mouth, let him preach ever so--let him be never so solemn a\nhermit; but a bright face, a true trusting heart, a strong arm, and\nan humble mind, might do much in teaching those around him that men\nmay be gay and yet not profligate, that women may be devout and yet\nnot dead to the world.\n\nSuch had been his ideas as to his own future life; and though many\nwould think that as a clergyman he should have gone about his work\nwith more serious devotion of thought, nevertheless there was some\nwisdom in them;--some folly also, undoubtedly, as appeared by the\ntroubles into which they led him.\n\n\"I will not affect to think that to be bad,\" said he to himself,\n\"which in my heart of hearts does not seem to be bad.\" And thus he\nresolved that he might live without contamination among hunting\nsquires. And then, being a man only too prone by nature to do as\nothers did around him, he found by degrees that that could hardly be\nwrong for him which he admitted to be right for others.\n\nBut still his conscience upbraided him, and he declared to himself\nmore than once that after this year he would hunt no more. And then\nhis own Fanny would look at him on his return home on those days in a\nmanner that cut him to the heart. She would say nothing to him. She\nnever inquired in a sneering tone, and with angry eyes, whether he\nhad enjoyed his day's sport; but when he spoke of it, she could not\nanswer him with enthusiasm; and in other matters which concerned him\nshe was always enthusiastic.\n\nAfter a while, too, he made matters worse, for about the end of March\nhe did another very foolish thing. He almost consented to buy an\nexpensive horse from Sowerby--an animal which he by no means wanted,\nand which, if once possessed, would certainly lead him into further\ntrouble. A gentleman, when he has a good horse in his stable,\ndoes not like to leave him there eating his head off. If he be a\ngig-horse, the owner of him will be keen to drive a gig; if a hunter,\nthe happy possessor will wish to be with a pack of hounds.\n\n\"Mark,\" said Sowerby to him one day, when they were out together,\n\"this brute of mine is so fresh, I can hardly ride him; you are young\nand strong; change with me for an hour or so.\" And then they did\nchange, and the horse on which Robarts found himself mounted went\naway with him beautifully.\n\n\"He's a splendid animal,\" said Mark, when they again met.\n\n\"Yes, for a man of your weight. He's thrown away upon me;--too much\nof a horse for my purposes. I don't get along now quite as well as I\nused to do. He is a nice sort of hunter; just rising six, you know.\"\n\nHow it came to pass that the price of the splendid animal was\nmentioned between them, I need not describe with exactness. But it\ndid come to pass that Mr. Sowerby told the parson that the horse\nshould be his for \u00c2\u00a3130.\n\n\"And I really wish you'd take him,\" said Sowerby. \"It would be the\nmeans of partially relieving my mind of a great weight.\"\n\nMark looked up into his friend's face with an air of surprise, for he\ndid not at the moment understand how this should be the case.\n\n\"I am afraid, you know, that you will have to put your hand into your\npocket sooner or later about that accursed bill--\" Mark shrank as the\nprofane word struck his ears--\"and I should be glad to think that you\nhad got something in hand in the way of value.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that I shall have to pay the whole sum of \u00c2\u00a3500?\"\n\n\"Oh! dear, no; nothing of the kind. But something I dare say you will\nhave to pay: if you like to take Dandy for a hundred and thirty, you\ncan be prepared for that amount when Tozer comes to you. The horse is\ndog cheap, and you will have a long day for your money.\"\n\nMark at first declared, in a quiet, determined tone, that he did not\nwant the horse; but it afterwards appeared to him that if it were so\nfated that he must pay a portion of Mr. Sowerby's debts, he might as\nwell repay himself to any extent within his power. It would be as\nwell perhaps that he should take the horse and sell him. It did not\noccur to him that by so doing he would put it in Mr. Sowerby's power\nto say that some valuable consideration had passed between them with\nreference to this bill, and that he would be aiding that gentleman\nin preparing an inextricable confusion of money-matters between them.\nMr. Sowerby well knew the value of this. It would enable him to make\na plausible story, as he had done in that other case of Lord Lufton.\n\n\"Are you going to have Dandy?\" Sowerby said to him again.\n\n\"I can't say that I will just at present,\" said the parson. \"What\nshould I want of him now the season's over?\"\n\n\"Exactly, my dear fellow; and what do I want of him now the season's\nover? If it were the beginning of October instead of the end of\nMarch, Dandy would be up at two hundred and thirty instead of one: in\nsix months' time that horse will be worth anything you like to ask\nfor him. Look at his bone.\"\n\nThe vicar did look at his bones, examining the brute in a very\nknowing and unclerical manner. He lifted the animal's four feet, one\nafter another, handling the frogs, and measuring with his eye the\nproportion of the parts; he passed his hand up and down the legs,\nspanning the bones of the lower joint; he peered into his eyes, took\ninto consideration the width of his chest, the dip of his back, the\nform of his ribs, the curve of his haunches, and his capabilities\nfor breathing when pressed by work. And then he stood away a little,\neyeing him from the side, and taking in a general idea of the form\nand make of the whole. \"He seems to stand over a little, I think,\"\nsaid the parson.\n\n\"It's the lie of the ground. Move him about, Bob. There now, let him\nstand there.\"\n\n\"He's not perfect,\" said Mark. \"I don't quite like his heels; but no\ndoubt he's a nicish cut of a horse.\"\n\n\"I rather think he is. If he were perfect, as you say, he would not\nbe going into your stables for a hundred and thirty. Do you ever\nremember to have seen a perfect horse?\"\n\n\"Your mare Mrs. Gamp was as nearly perfect as possible.\"\n\n\"Even Mrs. Gamp had her faults. In the first place she was a bad\nfeeder. But one certainly doesn't often come across anything much\nbetter than Mrs. Gamp.\" And thus the matter was talked over between\nthem with much stable conversation, all of which tended to make\nSowerby more and more oblivious of his friend's sacred profession,\nand perhaps to make the vicar himself too frequently oblivious of it\nalso. But no: he was not oblivious of it. He was even mindful of it;\nbut mindful of it in such a manner that his thoughts on the subject\nwere nowadays always painful.\n\nThere is a parish called Hogglestock lying away quite in the northern\nextremity of the eastern division of the county--lying also on the\nborders of the western division. I almost fear that it will become\nnecessary, before this history be completed, to provide a map of\nBarsetshire for the due explanation of all these localities. Framley\nis also in the northern portion of the county, but just to the\nsouth of the grand trunk line of railway from which the branch to\nBarchester strikes off at a point some thirty miles nearer to London.\nThe station for Framley Court is Silverbridge, which is, however, in\nthe western division of the county. Hogglestock is to the north of\nthe railway, the line of which, however, runs through a portion of\nthe parish, and it adjoins Framley, though the churches are as much\nas seven miles apart. Barsetshire, taken altogether, is a pleasant\ngreen tree-becrowded county, with large bosky hedges, pretty damp\ndeep lanes, and roads with broad grass margins running along them.\nSuch is the general nature of the county; but just up in its northern\nextremity this nature alters. There it is bleak and ugly, with low\nartificial hedges and without wood; not uncultivated, as it is all\nportioned out into new-looking large fields, bearing turnips and\nwheat and mangel, all in due course of agricultural rotation; but it\nhas none of the special beauties of English cultivation. There is not\na gentleman's house in the parish of Hogglestock besides that of the\nclergyman; and this, though it is certainly the house of a gentleman,\ncan hardly be said to be fit to be so. It is ugly, and straight, and\nsmall. There is a garden attached to the house, half in front of\nit and half behind; but this garden, like the rest of the parish,\nis by no means ornamental, though sufficiently useful. It produces\ncabbages, but no trees: potatoes of, I believe, an excellent\ndescription, but hardly any flowers, and nothing worthy of the name\nof a shrub. Indeed the whole parish of Hogglestock should have been\nin the adjoining county, which is by no means so attractive as\nBarsetshire;--a fact well known to those few of my readers who are\nwell acquainted with their own country.\n\nMr. Crawley, whose name has been mentioned in these pages, was the\nincumbent of Hogglestock. On what principle the remuneration of our\nparish clergymen was settled when the original settlement was made,\nno deepest, keenest lover of middle-aged ecclesiastical black-letter\nlearning can, I take it, now say. That the priests were to be paid\nfrom tithes of the parish produce, out of which tithes certain other\ngood things were to be bought and paid for, such as church repairs\nand education, of so much the most of us have an inkling. That\na rector, being a big sort of parson, owned the tithes of his\nparish in full,--or at any rate that part of them intended for the\nclergyman,--and that a vicar was somebody's deputy, and therefore\nentitled only to little tithes, as being a little body: of so much we\nthat are simple in such matters have a general idea. But one cannot\nconceive that even in this way any approximation could have been\nmade, even in those old medi\u00c3\u00a6val days, towards a fair proportioning\nof the pay to the work. At any rate, it is clear enough that there is\nno such approximation now.\n\nAnd what a screech would there not be among the clergy of the Church,\neven in these reforming days, if any over-bold reformer were to\nsuggest that such an approximation should be attempted? Let those who\nknow clergymen, and like them, and have lived with them, only fancy\nit! Clergymen to be paid, not according to the temporalities of any\nliving which they may have acquired either by merit or favour, but\nin accordance with the work to be done! O Doddington! and O Stanhope,\nthink of this, if an idea so sacrilegious can find entrance into your\nwarm ecclesiastical bosoms! Ecclesiastical work to be bought and paid\nfor according to its quantity and quality!\n\nBut, nevertheless, one may prophesy that we Englishmen must come to\nthis, disagreeable as the idea undoubtedly is. Most pleasant-minded\nchurchmen feel, I think, on this subject pretty much in the same way.\nOur present arrangement of parochial incomes is beloved as being\ntime-honoured, gentlemanlike, English, and picturesque. We would fain\nadhere to it closely as long as we can, but we know that we do so\nby the force of our prejudices, and not by that of our judgment.\nA time-honoured, gentlemanlike, English, picturesque arrangement\nis so far very delightful. But are there not other attributes very\ndesirable--nay, absolutely necessary--in respect to which this\ntime-honoured, picturesque arrangement is so very deficient?\n\nHow pleasant it was, too, that one bishop should be getting fifteen\nthousand a year and another with an equal cure of parsons only four!\nThat a certain prelate could get twenty thousand one year and his\nsuccessor in the same diocese only five the next! There was something\nin it pleasant, and picturesque; it was an arrangement endowed with\nfeudal charms, and the change which they have made was distasteful to\nmany of us. A bishop with a regular salary, and no appanage of land\nand land-bailiffs, is only half a bishop. Let any man prove to me the\ncontrary ever so thoroughly--let me prove it to my own self ever so\noften--my heart in this matter is not thereby a whit altered. One\nliked to know that there was a dean or two who got his three thousand\na year, and that old Dr. Purple held four stalls, one of which was\ngolden, and the other three silver-gilt! Such knowledge was always\npleasant to me! A golden stall! How sweet is the sound thereof to\nchurch-loving ears!\n\nBut bishops have been shorn of their beauty, and deans are in\ntheir decadence. A utilitarian age requires the fatness of the\necclesiastical land, in order that it may be divided out into\nsmall portions of provender, on which necessary working clergymen\nmay live,--into portions so infinitesimally small that working\nclergymen can hardly live. And the full-blown rectors and vicars,\nwith full-blown tithes--with tithes when too full-blown for strict\nutilitarian principles--will necessarily follow. Stanhope and\nDoddington must bow their heads, with such compensation for temporal\nrights as may be extracted,--but probably without such compensation\nas may be desired. In other trades, professions, and lines of life,\nmen are paid according to their work. Let it be so in the Church.\nSuch will sooner or later be the edict of a utilitarian, reforming,\nmatter-of-fact House of Parliament.\n\nI have a scheme of my own on the subject, which I will not introduce\nhere, seeing that neither men nor women would read it. And with\nreference to this matter, I will only here further explain that all\nthese words have been brought about by the fact, necessary to be here\nstated, that Mr. Crawley only received one hundred and thirty pounds\na year for performing the whole parochial duty of the parish of\nHogglestock. And Hogglestock is a large parish. It includes two\npopulous villages, abounding in brickmakers, a race of men very\ntroublesome to a zealous parson who won't let men go rollicking to\nthe devil without interference. Hogglestock has full work for two\nmen; and yet all the funds therein applicable to parson's work is\nthis miserable stipend of one hundred and thirty pounds a year. It\nis a stipend neither picturesque, nor time-honoured, nor feudal, for\nHogglestock takes rank only as a perpetual curacy.\n\nMr. Crawley has been mentioned before as a clergyman of whom Mr.\nRobarts said, that he almost thought it wrong to take a walk out of\nhis own parish. In so saying Mark Robarts of course burlesqued his\nbrother parson; but there can be no doubt that Mr. Crawley was a\nstrict man,--a strict, stern, unpleasant man, and one who feared God\nand his own conscience. We must say a word or two of Mr. Crawley and\nhis concerns.\n\nHe was now some forty years of age, but of these he had not been in\npossession even of his present benefice for more than four or five.\nThe first ten years of his life as a clergyman had been passed in\nperforming the duties and struggling through the life of a curate\nin a bleak, ugly, cold parish on the northern coast of Cornwall.\nIt had been a weary life and a fearful struggle, made up of duties\nill requited and not always satisfactorily performed, of love and\npoverty, of increasing cares, of sickness, debt, and death. For Mr.\nCrawley had married almost as soon as he was ordained, and children\nhad been born to him in that chill, comfortless Cornish cottage.\nHe had married a lady well educated and softly nurtured, but not\ndowered with worldly wealth. They two had gone forth determined\nto fight bravely together; to disregard the world and the world's\nways, looking only to God and to each other for their comfort. They\nwould give up ideas of gentle living, of soft raiment, and delicate\nfeeding. Others,--those that work with their hands, even the\nbettermost of such workers--could live in decency and health upon\neven such provision as he could earn as a clergyman. In such manner\nwould they live, so poorly and so decently, working out their work,\nnot with their hands but with their hearts.\n\nAnd so they had established themselves, beginning the world with\none bare-footed little girl of fourteen to aid them in their small\nhousehold matters; and for a while they had both kept heart, loving\neach other dearly, and prospering somewhat in their work. But a man\nwho has once walked the world as a gentleman knows not what it is to\nchange his position, and place himself lower down in the social rank.\nMuch less can he know what it is so to put down the woman whom he\nloves. There are a thousand things, mean and trifling in themselves,\nwhich a man despises when he thinks of them in his philosophy, but\nto dispense with which puts his philosophy to so stern a proof. Let\nany plainest man who reads this think of his usual mode of getting\nhimself into his matutinal garments, and confess how much such a\nstruggle would cost him.\n\nAnd then children had come. The wife of the labouring man does rear\nher children, and often rears them in health, without even so many\nappliances of comfort as found their way into Mrs. Crawley's cottage;\nbut the task to her was almost more than she could accomplish. Not\nthat she ever fainted or gave way: she was made of the sterner metal\nof the two, and could last on while he was prostrate.\n\nAnd sometimes he was prostrate--prostrate in soul and spirit. Then\nwould he complain with bitter voice, crying out that the world was\ntoo hard for him, that his back was broken with his burden, that his\nGod had deserted him. For days and days, in such moods, he would stay\nwithin his cottage, never darkening the door or seeing other face\nthan those of his own inmates. Those days were terrible both to him\nand her. He would sit there unwashed, with his unshorn face resting\non his hand, with an old dressing-gown hanging loose about him,\nhardly tasting food, seldom speaking, striving to pray, but striving\nso frequently in vain. And then he would rise from his chair, and,\nwith a burst of frenzy, call upon his Creator to remove him from this\nmisery.\n\nIn these moments she never deserted him. At one period they had had\nfour children, and though the whole weight of this young brood rested\non her arms, on her muscles, on her strength of mind and body, she\nnever ceased in her efforts to comfort him. Then at length, falling\nutterly upon the ground, he would pour forth piteous prayers for\nmercy, and, after a night of sleep, would once more go forth to his\nwork.\n\nBut she never yielded to despair: the struggle was never beyond\nher powers of endurance. She had possessed her share of woman's\nloveliness, but that was now all gone. Her colour quickly faded, and\nthe fresh, soft tints soon deserted her face and forehead. She became\nthin, and rough, and almost haggard: thin, till her cheek-bones were\nnearly pressing through her skin, till her elbows were sharp, and her\nfinger-bones as those of a skeleton. Her eye did not lose its lustre,\nbut it became unnaturally bright, prominent, and too large for her\nwan face. The soft brown locks which she had once loved to brush\nback, scorning, as she would boast to herself, to care that they\nshould be seen, were now sparse enough and all untidy and unclean.\nIt was matter of little thought now whether they were seen or no.\nWhether he could be made fit to go into his pulpit--whether they\nmight be fed--those four innocents--and their backs kept from the\ncold wind--that was now the matter of her thought.\n\nAnd then two of them died, and she went forth herself to see them\nlaid under the frost-bound sod, lest he should faint in his work over\ntheir graves. For he would ask aid from no man--such at least was his\nboast through all.\n\nTwo of them died, but their illness had been long; and then debts\ncame upon them. Debt, indeed, had been creeping on them with slow\nbut sure feet during the last five years. Who can see his children\nhungry, and not take bread if it be offered? Who can see his wife\nlying in sharpest want, and not seek a remedy if there be a remedy\nwithin reach? So debt had come upon them, and rude men pressed for\nsmall sums of money--for sums small to the world, but impossibly\nlarge to them. And he would hide himself within there, in that cranny\nof an inner chamber--hide himself with deep shame from the world,\nwith shame, and a sinking heart, and a broken spirit.\n\nBut had such a man no friend? it will be said. Such men, I take it,\ndo not make many friends. But this man was not utterly friendless.\nAlmost every year one visit was paid to him in his Cornish curacy\nby a brother clergyman, an old college friend, who, as far as\nmight in him lie, did give aid to the curate and his wife. This\ngentleman would take up his abode for a week at a farmer's in the\nneighbourhood, and though he found Mr. Crawley in despair, he would\nleave him with some drops of comfort in his soul. Nor were the\nbenefits in this respect all on one side. Mr. Crawley, though at some\nperiods weak enough for himself, could be strong for others; and,\nmore than once, was strong to the great advantage of this man whom\nhe loved. And then, too, pecuniary assistance was forthcoming--in\nthose earlier years not in great amount, for this friend was not then\namong the rich ones of the earth--but in amount sufficient for that\nmoderate hearth, if only its acceptance could have been managed. But\nin that matter there were difficulties without end. Of absolute money\ntenders Mr. Crawley would accept none. But a bill here and there was\npaid, the wife assisting; and shoes came for Kate--till Kate was\nplaced beyond the need of shoes; and cloth for Harry and Frank found\nits way surreptitiously in beneath the cover of that wife's solitary\ntrunk--cloth with which those lean fingers worked garments for the\ntwo boys, to be worn--such was God's will--only by the one.\n\nSuch were Mr. and Mrs. Crawley in their Cornish curacy, and during\ntheir severest struggles. To one who thinks that a fair day's work is\nworth a fair day's wages, it seems hard enough that a man should work\nso hard and receive so little. There will be those who think that the\nfault was all his own in marrying so young. But still there remains\nthat question, Is not a fair day's work worth a fair day's wages?\nThis man did work hard--at a task perhaps the hardest of any that a\nman may do; and for ten years he earned some seventy pounds a year.\nWill any one say that he received fair wages for his fair work, let\nhim be married or single? And yet there are so many who would fain\npay their clergy, if they only knew how to apply their money! But\nthat is a long subject, as Mr. Robarts had told Miss Dunstable.\n\nSuch was Mr. Crawley in his Cornish curacy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nLADY LUFTON'S AMBASSADOR.\n\n\nAnd then, in the days which followed, that friend of Mr. Crawley's,\nwhose name, by-the-by, is yet to be mentioned, received quick\nand great promotion. Mr. Arabin by name he was then;--Dr. Arabin\nafterwards, when that quick and great promotion reached its climax.\nHe had been simply a Fellow of Lazarus in those former years. Then he\nbecame Vicar of St. Ewold's, in East Barsetshire, and had not yet got\nhimself settled there when he married the Widow Bold, a widow with\nbelongings in land and funded money, and with but one small baby as\nan encumbrance. Nor had he even yet married her,--had only engaged\nhimself so to do, when they made him Dean of Barchester--all which\nmay be read in the diocesan and county chronicles.\n\nAnd now that he was wealthy, the new dean did contrive to pay the\ndebts of his poor friend, some lawyer of Camelford assisting him.\nIt was but a paltry schedule after all, amounting in the total to\nsomething not much above a hundred pounds. And then, in the course\nof eighteen months, this poor piece of preferment fell in the dean's\nway, this incumbency of Hogglestock with its stipend reaching one\nhundred and thirty pounds a year. Even that was worth double the\nCornish curacy, and there was, moreover, a house attached to it. Poor\nMrs. Crawley, when she heard of it, thought that their struggles\nof poverty were now well nigh over. What might not be done with a\nhundred and thirty pounds by people who had lived for ten years on\nseventy?\n\nAnd so they moved away out of that cold, bleak country, carrying with\nthem their humble household gods, and settled themselves in another\ncountry, cold and bleak also, but less terribly so than the former.\nThey settled themselves, and again began their struggles against\nman's hardness and the devil's zeal. I have said that Mr. Crawley was\na stern, unpleasant man; and it certainly was so. The man must be\nmade of very sterling stuff, whom continued and undeserved misfortune\ndoes not make unpleasant. This man had so far succumbed to grief,\nthat it had left upon him its marks, palpable and not to be effaced.\nHe cared little for society, judging men to be doing evil who did\ncare for it. He knew as a fact, and believed with all his heart,\nthat these sorrows had come to him from the hand of God, and that\nthey would work for his weal in the long run; but not the less did\nthey make him morose, silent, and dogged. He had always at his\nheart a feeling that he and his had been ill-used, and too often\nsolaced himself, at the devil's bidding, with the conviction that\neternity would make equal that which life in this world had made so\nunequal;--the last bait that with which the devil angles after those\nwho are struggling to elude his rod and line.\n\nThe Framley property did not run into the parish of Hogglestock; but\nnevertheless Lady Lufton did what she could in the way of kindness to\nthese new-comers. Providence had not supplied Hogglestock with a Lady\nLufton, or with any substitute in the shape of lord or lady, squire\nor squiress. The Hogglestock farmers, male and female, were a rude,\nrough set, not bordering in their social rank on the farmer gentle;\nand Lady Lufton, knowing this, and hearing something of these\nCrawleys from Mrs. Arabin, the dean's wife, trimmed her lamps, so\nthat they should shed a wider light, and pour forth some of their\ninfluence on that forlorn household.\n\nAnd as regards Mrs. Crawley, Lady Lufton by no means found that\nher work and good-will were thrown away. Mrs. Crawley accepted her\nkindness with thankfulness, and returned to some of the softnesses of\nlife under her hand. As for dining at Framley Court, that was out of\nthe question. Mr. Crawley, she knew, would not hear of it, even if\nother things were fitting and appliances were at command. Indeed Mrs.\nCrawley at once said that she felt herself unfit to go through such\na ceremony with anything like comfort. The dean, she said, would\ntalk of their going to stay at the deanery; but she thought it quite\nimpossible that either of them should endure even that. But, all the\nsame, Lady Lufton was a comfort to her; and the poor woman felt that\nit was well to have a lady near her in case of need.\n\nThe task was much harder with Mr. Crawley, but even with him it was\nnot altogether unsuccessful. Lady Lufton talked to him of his parish\nand of her own; made Mark Robarts go to him, and by degrees did\nsomething towards civilizing him. Between him and Robarts too there\ngrew up an intimacy rather than a friendship. Robarts would submit\nto his opinion on matters of ecclesiastical and even theological law,\nwould listen to him with patience, would agree with him where he\ncould, and differ from him mildly when he could not. For Robarts\nwas a man who made himself pleasant to all men. And thus, under\nLady Lufton's wing, there grew up a connection between Framley and\nHogglestock, in which Mrs. Robarts also assisted.\n\nAnd now that Lady Lufton was looking about her, to see how she might\nbest bring proper clerical influence to bear upon her own recreant\nfox-hunting parson, it occurred to her that she might use Mr. Crawley\nin the matter. Mr. Crawley would certainly be on her side as far as\nopinion went, and would have no fear as to expressing his opinion to\nhis brother clergyman. So she sent for Mr. Crawley.\n\nIn appearance he was the very opposite to Mark Robarts. He was a\nlean, slim, meagre man, with shoulders slightly curved, and pale,\nlank, long locks of ragged hair; his forehead was high, but his face\nwas narrow; his small grey eyes were deeply sunken in his head, his\nnose was well-formed, his lips thin, and his mouth expressive. Nobody\ncould look at him without seeing that there was a purpose and a\nmeaning in his countenance. He always wore, in summer and winter,\na long dusky gray coat, which buttoned close up to his neck and\ndescended almost to his heels. He was full six feet high, but being\nso slight in build, he looked as though he were taller.\n\nHe came at once at Lady Lufton's bidding, putting himself into the\ngig beside the servant, to whom he spoke no single word during\nthe journey. And the man, looking into his face, was struck with\ntaciturnity. Now Mark Robarts would have talked with him the whole\nway from Hogglestock to Framley Court; discoursing partly as to\nhorses and land, but partly also as to higher things.\n\nAnd then Lady Lufton opened her mind and told her griefs to Mr.\nCrawley, urging, however, through the whole length of her narrative,\nthat Mr. Robarts was an excellent parish clergyman,--\"just such a\nclergyman in his church as I would wish him to be,\" she explained,\nwith the view of saving herself from an expression of any of Mr.\nCrawley's special ideas as to church teaching, and of confining him\nto the one subject-matter in hand; \"but he got this living so young,\nMr. Crawley, that he is hardly quite as steady as I could wish him to\nbe. It has been as much my fault as his own in placing him in such a\nposition so early in life.\"\n\n\"I think it has,\" said Mr. Crawley, who might perhaps be a little\nsore on such a subject.\n\n\"Quite so, quite so,\" continued her ladyship, swallowing down with\na gulp a certain sense of anger. \"But that is done now, and is past\ncure. That Mr. Robarts will become a credit to his profession, I do\nnot doubt, for his heart is in the right place and his sentiments are\ngood; but I fear that at present he is succumbing to temptation.\"\n\n\"I am told that he hunts two or three times a week. Everybody round\nus is talking about it.\"\n\n\"No, Mr. Crawley; not two or three times a week; very seldom above\nonce, I think. And then I do believe he does it more with the view of\nbeing with Lord Lufton than anything else.\"\n\n\"I cannot see that that would make the matter better,\" said Mr.\nCrawley.\n\n\"It would show that he was not strongly imbued with a taste which I\ncannot but regard as vicious in a clergyman.\"\n\n\"It must be vicious in all men,\" said Mr. Crawley. \"It is in itself\ncruel, and leads to idleness and profligacy.\"\n\nAgain Lady Lufton made a gulp. She had called Mr. Crawley thither to\nher aid, and felt that it would be inexpedient to quarrel with him.\nBut she did not like to be told that her son's amusement was idle and\nprofligate. She had always regarded hunting as a proper pursuit for\na country gentleman. It was, indeed, in her eyes one of the peculiar\ninstitutions of country life in England, and it may be almost said\nthat she looked upon the Barsetshire hunt as something sacred. She\ncould not endure to hear that a fox was trapped, and allowed her\nturkeys to be purloined without a groan. Such being the case, she\ndid not like being told that it was vicious, and had by no means\nwished to consult Mr. Crawley on that matter. But nevertheless, she\nswallowed down her wrath.\n\n\"It is at any rate unbecoming in a clergyman,\" she said; \"and as I\nknow that Mr. Robarts places a high value on your opinion, perhaps\nyou will not object to advise him to discontinue it. He might\npossibly feel aggrieved were I to interfere personally on such a\nquestion.\"\n\n\"I have no doubt he would,\" said Mr. Crawley. \"It is not within a\nwoman's province to give counsel to a clergyman on such a subject,\nunless she be very near and very dear to him--his wife, or mother, or\nsister.\"\n\n\"As living in the same parish, you know, and being, perhaps--\" the\nleading person in it, and the one who naturally rules the others.\nThose would have been the fitting words for the expression of her\nladyship's ideas; but she remembered herself, and did not use them.\nShe had made up her mind that, great as her influence ought to be,\nshe was not the proper person to speak to Mr. Robarts as to his\npernicious, unclerical habits, and she would not now depart from her\nresolve by attempting to prove that she was the proper person.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Crawley, \"just so. All that would entitle him to\noffer you his counsel if he thought that your mode of life was such\nas to require it, but could by no means justify you in addressing\nyourself to him.\"\n\nThis was very hard upon Lady Lufton. She was endeavouring with all\nher woman's strength to do her best, and endeavouring so to do it\nthat the feelings of the sinner might be spared; and yet the ghostly\ncomforter whom she had evoked to her aid, treated her as though she\nwere arrogant and overbearing. She acknowledged the weakness of her\nown position with reference to her parish clergyman by calling in the\naid of Mr. Crawley; and under such circumstances, he might, at any\nrate, have abstained from throwing that weakness in her teeth.\n\n\"Well, sir; I hope my mode of life may not require it; but that is\nnot exactly to the point: what I wish to know is, whether you will\nspeak to Mr. Robarts?\"\n\n\"Certainly I will,\" said he.\n\n\"Then I shall be much obliged to you. But, Mr. Crawley, pray--pray,\nremember this: I would not on any account wish that you should be\nharsh with him. He is an excellent young man, and--\"\n\n\"Lady Lufton, if I do this, I can only do it in my own way, as best\nI may, using such words as God may give me at the time. I hope that\nI am harsh to no man; but it is worse than useless, in all cases, to\nspeak anything but the truth.\"\n\n\"Of course--of course.\"\n\n\"If the ears be too delicate to hear the truth, the mind will be too\nperverse to profit by it.\" And then Mr. Crawley got up to take his\nleave.\n\nBut Lady Lufton insisted that he should go with her to luncheon. He\nhummed and ha'd and would fain have refused, but on this subject she\nwas peremptory. It might be that she was unfit to advise a clergyman\nas to his duties, but in a matter of hospitality she did know what\nshe was about. Mr. Crawley should not leave the house without\nrefreshment. As to this, she carried her point; and Mr. Crawley--when\nthe matter before him was cold roast-beef and hot potatoes,\ninstead of the relative position of a parish priest and his\nparishioner--became humble, submissive, and almost timid. Lady Lufton\nrecommended Madeira instead of Sherry, and Mr. Crawley obeyed at\nonce, and was, indeed, perfectly unconscious of the difference. Then\nthere was a basket of seakale in the gig for Mrs. Crawley; that he\nwould have left behind had he dared, but he did not dare. Not a word\nwas said to him as to the marmalade for the children which was hidden\nunder the seakale, Lady Lufton feeling well aware that that would\nfind its way to its proper destination without any necessity for his\nco-operation. And then Mr. Crawley returned home in the Framley Court\ngig.\n\nThree or four days after this he walked over to Framley Parsonage.\nThis he did on a Saturday, having learned that the hounds never\nhunted on that day; and he started early, so that he might be sure to\ncatch Mr. Robarts before he went out on his parish business. He was\nquite early enough to attain this object, for when he reached the\nparsonage door at about half-past nine, the vicar, with his wife and\nsister, were just sitting down to breakfast.\n\n\"Oh, Crawley,\" said Robarts, before the other had well spoken, \"you\nare a capital fellow;\" and then he got him into a chair, and Mrs.\nRobarts had poured him out tea, and Lucy had surrendered to him a\nknife and plate, before he knew under what guise to excuse his coming\namong them.\n\n\"I hope you will excuse this intrusion,\" at last he muttered; \"but I\nhave a few words of business to which I will request your attention\npresently.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Robarts, conveying a broiled kidney on to the plate\nbefore Mr. Crawley; \"but there is no preparation for business like\na good breakfast. Lucy, hand Mr. Crawley the buttered toast. Eggs,\nFanny; where are the eggs?\" And then John, in livery, brought in the\nfresh eggs. \"Now we shall do. I always eat my eggs while they're hot,\nCrawley, and I advise you to do the same.\"\n\nTo all this Mr. Crawley said very little, and he was not at all at\nhome under the circumstances. Perhaps a thought did pass across his\nbrain, as to the difference between the meal which he had left on his\nown table, and that which he now saw before him; and as to any cause\nwhich might exist for such difference. But, if so, it was a very\nfleeting thought, for he had far other matter now fully occupying his\nmind. And then the breakfast was over, and in a few minutes the two\nclergymen found themselves together in the parsonage study.\n\n\"Mr. Robarts,\" began the senior, when he had seated himself\nuncomfortably on one of the ordinary chairs at the farther side of\nthe well-stored library table, while Mark was sitting at his ease\nin his own arm-chair by the fire, \"I have called upon you on an\nunpleasant business.\"\n\nMark's mind immediately flew off to Mr. Sowerby's bill, but he could\nnot think it possible that Mr. Crawley could have had anything to do\nwith that.\n\n\"But as a brother clergyman, and as one who esteems you much and\nwishes you well, I have thought myself bound to take this matter in\nhand.\"\n\n\"What matter is it, Crawley?\"\n\n\"Mr. Robarts, men say that your present mode of life is one that is\nnot befitting a soldier in Christ's army.\"\n\n\"Men say so! what men?\"\n\n\"The men around you, of your own neighbourhood; those who watch\nyour life, and know all your doings; those who look to see you\nwalking as a lamp to guide their feet, but find you consorting with\nhorse-jockeys and hunters, galloping after hounds, and taking your\nplace among the vainest of worldly pleasure-seekers. Those who have a\nright to expect an example of good living, and who think that they do\nnot see it.\"\n\nMr. Crawley had gone at once to the root of the matter, and in doing\nso had certainly made his own task so much the easier. There is\nnothing like going to the root of the matter at once when one has on\nhand an unpleasant piece of business.\n\n\"And have such men deputed you to come here?\"\n\n\"No one has or could depute me. I have come to speak my own mind, not\nthat of any other. But I refer to what those around you think and\nsay, because it is to them that your duties are due. You owe it to\nthose around you to live a godly, cleanly life;--as you owe it also,\nin a much higher way, to your Father who is in heaven. I now make\nbold to ask you whether you are doing your best to lead such a life\nas that?\" And then he remained silent, waiting for an answer.\n\nHe was a singular man; so humble and meek, so unutterably inefficient\nand awkward in the ordinary intercourse of life, but so bold and\nenterprising, almost eloquent, on the one subject which was the work\nof his mind! As he sat there, he looked into his companion's face\nfrom out his sunken grey eyes with a gaze which made his victim\nquail. And then repeated his words: \"I now make bold to ask you,\nMr. Robarts, whether you are doing your best to lead such a life as\nmay become a parish clergyman among his parishioners?\" And again he\npaused for an answer.\n\n\"There are but few of us,\" said Mark in a low tone, \"who could safely\nanswer that question in the affirmative.\"\n\n\"But are there many, think you, among us who would find the question\nso unanswerable as yourself? And even were there many, would you,\nyoung, enterprising, and talented as you are, be content to be\nnumbered among them? Are you satisfied to be a castaway after you\nhave taken upon yourself Christ's armour? If you will say so, I am\nmistaken in you, and will go my way.\" There was again a pause, and\nthen he went on. \"Speak to me, my brother, and open your heart if it\nbe possible.\" And rising from his chair, he walked across the room,\nand laid his hand tenderly on Mark's shoulder.\n\nMark had been sitting lounging in his chair, and had at first, for a\nmoment only, thought to brazen it out. But all idea of brazening had\nnow left him. He had raised himself from his comfortable ease, and\nwas leaning forward with his elbow on the table; but now, when he\nheard these words, he allowed his head to sink upon his arms, and he\nburied his face between his hands.\n\n\"It is a terrible falling off,\" continued Crawley: \"terrible in the\nfall, but doubly terrible through that difficulty of returning. But\nit cannot be that it should content you to place yourself as one\namong those thoughtless sinners, for the crushing of whose sin you\nhave been placed here among them. You become a hunting parson, and\nride with a happy mind among blasphemers and mocking devils--you,\nwhose aspirations were so high, who have spoken so often and so well\nof the duties of a minister of Christ; you, who can argue in your\npride as to the petty details of your Church, as though the broad\nteachings of its great and simple lessons were not enough for your\nenergies! It cannot be that I have had a hypocrite beside me in all\nthose eager controversies!\"\n\n\"Not a hypocrite--not a hypocrite,\" said Mark, in a tone which was\nalmost reduced to sobbing.\n\n\"But a castaway! Is it so that I must call you? No, Mr. Robarts,\nnot a castaway; neither a hypocrite, nor a castaway; but one who\nin walking has stumbled in the dark and bruised his feet among\nthe stones. Henceforth let him take a lantern in his hand, and\nlook warily to his path, and walk cautiously among the thorns and\nrocks,--cautiously, but yet boldly, with manly courage, but Christian\nmeekness, as all men should walk on their pilgrimage through this\nvale of tears.\" And then without giving his companion time to stop\nhim he hurried out of the room, and from the house, and without\nagain seeing any others of the family, stalked back on his road to\nHogglestock, thus tramping fourteen miles through the deep mud in\nperformance of the mission on which he had been sent.\n\nIt was some hours before Mr. Robarts left his room. As soon as he\nfound that Crawley was really gone, and that he should see him no\nmore, he turned the lock of his door, and sat himself down to think\nover his present life. At about eleven his wife knocked, not knowing\nwhether that other strange clergyman were there or no, for none had\nseen his departure. But Mark, answering cheerily, desired that he\nmight be left to his studies.\n\nLet us hope that his thoughts and mental resolves were then of\nservice to him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nMRS. PODGENS' BABY.\n\n\nThe hunting season had now nearly passed away, and the great ones\nof the Barsetshire world were thinking of the glories of London. Of\nthese glories Lady Lufton always thought with much inquietude of\nmind. She would fain have remained throughout the whole year at\nFramley Court, did not certain grave considerations render such a\ncourse on her part improper in her own estimation. All the Lady\nLuftons of whom she had heard, dowager and ante-dowager, had always\nhad their seasons in London, till old age had incapacitated them for\nsuch doings--sometimes for clearly long after the arrival of such\nperiod. And then she had an idea, perhaps not altogether erroneous,\nthat she annually imported back with her into the country somewhat of\nthe passing civilization of the times:--may we not say an idea that\ncertainly was not erroneous? for how otherwise is it that the forms\nof new caps and remodelled shapes for women's waists find their\nway down into agricultural parts, and that the rural eye learns\nto appreciate grace and beauty? There are those who think that\nremodelled waists and new caps had better be kept to the towns; but\nsuch people, if they would follow out their own argument, would wish\nto see ploughboys painted with ruddle and milkmaids covered with\nskins.\n\nFor these and other reasons Lady Lufton always went to London in\nApril, and stayed there till the beginning of June. But for her this\nwas usually a period of penance. In London she was no very great\npersonage. She had never laid herself out for greatness of that sort,\nand did not shine as a lady-patroness or state secretary in the\nfemale cabinet of fashion. She was dull and listless, and without\ncongenial pursuits in London, and spent her happiest moments in\nreading accounts of what was being done at Framley, and in writing\norders for further local information of the same kind.\n\nBut on this occasion there was a matter of vital import to give\nan interest of its own to her visit to town. She was to entertain\nGriselda Grantly, and as far as might be possible to induce her son\nto remain in Griselda's society. The plan of the campaign was to be\nas follows:--Mrs. Grantly and the archdeacon were in the first place\nto go up to London for a month, taking Griselda with them; and then,\nwhen they returned to Plumstead, Griselda was to go to Lady Lufton.\nThis arrangement was not at all points agreeable to Lady Lufton, for\nshe knew that Mrs. Grantly did not turn her back on the Hartletop\npeople quite as cordially as she should do, considering the terms of\nthe Lufton-Grantly family treaty. But then Mrs. Grantly might have\nalleged in excuse the slow manner in which Lord Lufton proceeded in\nthe making and declaring of his love, and the absolute necessity\nwhich there is for two strings to one's bow, when one string may be\nin any way doubtful. Could it be possible that Mrs. Grantly had heard\nanything of that unfortunate Platonic friendship with Lucy Robarts?\n\nThere came a letter from Mrs. Grantly just about the end of March,\nwhich added much to Lady Lufton's uneasiness, and made her more\nthan ever anxious to be herself on the scene of action and to have\nGriselda in her own hands. After some communications of mere ordinary\nimportance with reference to the London world in general and the\nLufton-Grantly world in particular, Mrs. Grantly wrote confidentially\nabout her daughter:\n\n\"It would be useless to deny,\" she said, with a mother's pride and a\nmother's humility, \"that she is very much admired. She is asked out a\ngreat deal more than I can take her, and to houses to which I myself\nby no means wish to go. I could not refuse her as to Lady Hartletop's\nfirst ball, for there will be nothing else this year like them; and\nof course when with you, dear Lady Lufton, that house will be out\nof the question. So indeed would it be with me, were I myself only\nconcerned. The duke was there, of course, and I really wonder Lady\nHartletop should not be more discreet in her own drawing-room when\nall the world is there. It is clear to me that Lord Dumbello admires\nGriselda much more than I could wish. She, dear girl, has such\nexcellent sense that I do not think it likely that her head should\nbe turned by it; but with how many girls would not the admiration of\nsuch a man be irresistible? The marquis, you know, is very feeble,\nand I am told that since this rage for building has come on, the\nLancashire property is over two hundred thousand a year!! I do not\nthink that Lord Dumbello has said much to her. Indeed it seems to me\nthat he never does say much to any one. But he always stands up to\ndance with her, and I see that he is uneasy and fidgety when she\nstands up with any other partner whom he could care about. It was\nreally embarrassing to see him the other night at Miss Dunstable's,\nwhen Griselda was dancing with a certain friend of ours. But she did\nlook very well that evening, and I have seldom seen her more\nanimated!\"\n\nAll this, and a great deal more of the same sort in the same letter,\ntended to make Lady Lufton anxious to be in London. It was quite\ncertain--there was no doubt of that, at any rate--that Griselda would\nsee no more of Lady Hartletop's meretricious grandeur when she had\nbeen transferred to Lady Lufton's guardianship. And she, Lady Lufton,\ndid wonder that Mrs. Grantly should have taken her daughter to such\na house. All about Lady Hartletop was known to all the world. It was\nknown that it was almost the only house in London at which the Duke\nof Omnium was constantly to be met. Lady Lufton herself would almost\nas soon think of taking a young girl to Gatherum Castle; and on these\naccounts she did feel rather angry with her friend Mrs. Grantly. But\nthen perhaps she did not sufficiently calculate that Mrs. Grantly's\nletter had been written purposely to produce such feelings--with the\nexpress view of awakening her ladyship to the necessity of action.\nIndeed in such a matter as this Mrs. Grantly was a more able woman\nthan Lady Lufton--more able to see her way and to follow it out.\nThe Lufton-Grantly alliance was in her mind the best, seeing that\nshe did not regard money as everything. But failing that, the\nHartletop-Grantly alliance was not bad. Regarding it as a second\nstring to her bow, she thought that it was not at all bad.\n\nLady Lufton's reply was very affectionate. She declared how happy\nshe was to know that Griselda was enjoying herself; she insinuated\nthat Lord Dumbello was known to the world as a fool, and his mother\nas--being not a bit better than she ought to be; and then she added\nthat circumstances would bring herself up to town four days sooner\nthan she had expected, and that she hoped her dear Griselda would\ncome to her at once. Lord Lufton, she said, though he would not sleep\nin Bruton Street--Lady Lufton lived in Bruton Street--had promised\nto pass there as much of his time as his parliamentary duties would\npermit.\n\nO Lady Lufton! Lady Lufton! did it not occur to you, when you wrote\nthose last words, intending that they should have so strong an\neffect on the mind of your correspondent, that you were telling\na--tarradiddle? Was it not the case that you had said to your son, in\nyour own dear, kind, motherly way: \"Ludovic, we shall see something\nof you in Bruton Street this year, shall we not? Griselda Grantly\nwill be with me, and we must not let her be dull--must we?\" And then\nhad he not answered, \"Oh, of course, mother,\" and sauntered out of\nthe room, not altogether graciously? Had he, or you, said a word\nabout his parliamentary duties? Not a word! O Lady Lufton! have you\nnot now written a tarradiddle to your friend?\n\nIn these days we are becoming very strict about truth with our\nchildren; terribly strict occasionally, when we consider the natural\nweakness of the moral courage at the ages of ten, twelve, and\nfourteen. But I do not know that we are at all increasing the measure\nof strictness with which we, grown-up people, regulate our own truth\nand falsehood. Heaven forbid that I should be thought to advocate\nfalsehood in children; but an untruth is more pardonable in them than\nin their parents. Lady Lufton's tarradiddle was of a nature that\nis usually considered excusable--at least with grown people; but,\nnevertheless, she would have been nearer to perfection could she have\nconfined herself to the truth. Let us suppose that a boy were to\nwrite home from school, saying that another boy had promised to come\nand stay with him, that other having given no such promise--what a\nvery naughty boy would that first boy be in the eyes of his pastors\nand masters!\n\nThat little conversation between Lord Lufton and his mother--in which\nnothing was said about his lordship's parliamentary duties--took\nplace on the evening before he started for London. On that occasion\nhe certainly was not in his best humour, nor did he behave to his\nmother in his kindest manner. He had then left the room when she\nbegan to talk about Miss Grantly; and once again in the course of the\nevening, when his mother, not very judiciously, said a word or two\nabout Griselda's beauty, he had remarked that she was no conjuror,\nand would hardly set the Thames on fire.\n\n\"If she were a conjuror!\" said Lady Lufton, rather piqued, \"I should\nnot now be going to take her out in London. I know many of those sort\nof girls whom you call conjurors; they can talk for ever, and always\ntalk either loudly or in a whisper. I don't like them, and I am sure\nthat you do not in your heart.\"\n\n\"Oh, as to liking them in my heart--that is being very particular.\"\n\n\"Griselda Grantly is a lady, and as such I shall be happy to have her\nwith me in town. She is just the girl that Justinia will like to have\nwith her.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Lord Lufton. \"She will do exceedingly well for\nJustinia.\"\n\nNow this was not good-natured on the part of Lord Lufton; and his\nmother felt it the more strongly, inasmuch as it seemed to signify\nthat he was setting his back up against the Lufton-Grantly alliance.\nShe had been pretty sure that he would do so in the event of his\nsuspecting that a plot was being laid to catch him; and now it almost\nappeared that he did suspect such a plot. Why else that sarcasm as to\nGriselda doing very well for his sister?\n\nAnd now we must go back and describe a little scene at Framley which\nwill account for his lordship's ill-humour and suspicions, and\nexplain how it came to pass that he so snubbed his mother. This scene\ntook place about ten days after the evening on which Mrs. Robarts\nand Lucy were walking together in the parsonage garden, and during\nthose ten days Lucy had not once allowed herself to be entrapped\ninto any special conversation with the young peer. She had dined at\nFramley Court during that interval, and had spent a second evening\nthere; Lord Lufton had also been up at the parsonage on three or\nfour occasions, and had looked for her in her usual walks; but,\nnevertheless, they had never come together in their old familiar\nway, since the day on which Lady Lufton had hinted her fears to Mrs.\nRobarts.\n\nLord Lufton had very much missed her. At first he had not attributed\nthis change to a purposed scheme of action on the part of any one;\nnor, indeed, had he much thought about it, although he had felt\nhimself to be annoyed. But as the period fixed for his departure\ngrew near, it did occur to him as very odd that he should never hear\nLucy's voice unless when she said a few words to his mother, or to\nher sister-in-law. And then he made up his mind that he would speak\nto her before he went, and that the mystery should be explained to\nhim.\n\nAnd he carried out his purpose, calling at the parsonage on one\nspecial afternoon; and it was on the evening of the same day that\nhis mother sang the praises of Griselda Grantly so inopportunely.\nRobarts, he knew, was then absent from home, and Mrs. Robarts was\nwith his mother down at the house, preparing lists of the poor people\nto be specially attended to in Lady Lufton's approaching absence.\nTaking advantage of this, he walked boldly in through the parsonage\ngarden; asked the gardener, with an indifferent voice, whether either\nof the ladies were at home, and then caught poor Lucy exactly on the\ndoorstep of the house.\n\n\"Were you going in or out, Miss Robarts?\"\n\n\"Well, I was going out,\" said Lucy; and she began to consider how\nbest she might get quit of any prolonged encounter.\n\n\"Oh, going out, were you? I don't know whether I may offer to--\"\n\n\"Well, Lord Lufton, not exactly, seeing that I am about to pay a\nvisit to our near neighbour, Mrs. Podgens. Perhaps you have no\nparticular call towards Mrs. Podgens' just at present, or to her new\nbaby?\"\n\n\"And have you any very particular call that way?\"\n\n\"Yes, and especially to Baby Podgens. Baby Podgens is a real little\nduck--only just two days old.\" And Lucy, as she spoke, progressed\na step or two, as though she were determined not to remain there\ntalking on the doorstep.\n\nA slight cloud came across his brow as he saw this, and made him\nresolve that she should not gain her purpose. He was not going to be\nfoiled in that way by such a girl as Lucy Robarts. He had come there\nto speak to her, and speak to her he would. There had been enough of\nintimacy between them to justify him in demanding, at any rate, as\nmuch as that.\n\n\"Miss Robarts,\" he said, \"I am starting for London to-morrow, and if\nI do not say good-bye to you now, I shall not be able to do so at\nall.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, Lord Lufton,\" she said, giving him her hand, and smiling\non him with her old genial, good-humoured, racy smile. \"And mind you\nbring into Parliament that law which you promised me for defending my\nyoung chickens.\"\n\nHe took her hand, but that was not all that he wanted. \"Surely Mrs.\nPodgens and her baby can wait ten minutes. I shall not see you again\nfor months to come, and yet you seem to begrudge me two words.\"\n\n\"Not two hundred if they can be of any service to you,\" said she,\nwalking cheerily back into the drawing-room; \"only I did not think it\nworth while to waste your time, as Fanny is not here.\"\n\nShe was infinitely more collected, more master of herself than he\nwas. Inwardly, she did tremble at the idea of what was coming, but\noutwardly she showed no agitation--none as yet; if only she could so\npossess herself as to refrain from doing so, when she heard what he\nmight have to say to her.\n\nHe hardly knew what it was for the saying of which he had so\nresolutely come thither. He had by no means made up his mind that he\nloved Lucy Robarts; nor had he made up his mind that, loving her, he\nwould, or that, loving her, he would not, make her his wife. He had\nnever used his mind in the matter in any way, either for good or\nevil. He had learned to like her and to think that she was very\npretty. He had found out that it was very pleasant to talk to her;\nwhereas, talking to Griselda Grantly, and, indeed, to some other\nyoung ladies of his acquaintance, was often hard work. The half-hours\nwhich he had spent with Lucy had always been satisfactory to him. He\nhad found himself to be more bright with her than with other people,\nand more apt to discuss subjects worth discussing; and thus it had\ncome about that he thoroughly liked Lucy Robarts. As to whether his\naffection was Platonic or anti-Platonic he had never asked himself;\nbut he had spoken words to her, shortly before that sudden cessation\nof their intimacy, which might have been taken as anti-Platonic by\nany girl so disposed to regard them. He had not thrown himself at\nher feet, and declared himself to be devoured by a consuming passion;\nbut he had touched her hand as lovers touch those of women whom they\nlove; he had had his confidences with her, talking to her of his own\nmother, of his sister, and of his friends; and he had called her his\nown dear friend Lucy.\n\nAll this had been very sweet to her, but very poisonous also. She had\ndeclared to herself very frequently that her liking for this young\nnobleman was as purely a feeling of mere friendship as was that of\nher brother; and she had professed to herself that she would give\nthe lie to the world's cold sarcasms on such subjects. But she had\nnow acknowledged that the sarcasms of the world on that matter,\ncold though they may be, are not the less true; and having so\nacknowledged, she had resolved that all close alliance between\nherself and Lord Lufton must be at an end. She had come to a\nconclusion, but he had come to none; and in this frame of mind he\nwas now there with the object of reopening that dangerous friendship\nwhich she had had the sense to close.\n\n\"And so you are going to-morrow?\" she said, as soon as they were both\nwithin the drawing-room.\n\n\"Yes: I'm off by the early train to-morrow morning, and Heaven knows\nwhen we may meet again.\"\n\n\"Next winter, shall we not?\"\n\n\"Yes, for a day or two, I suppose. I do not know whether I shall pass\nanother winter here. Indeed, one can never say where one will be.\"\n\n\"No, one can't; such as you, at least, cannot. I am not of a\nmigratory tribe myself.\"\n\n\"I wish you were.\"\n\n\"I'm not a bit obliged to you. Your nomade life does not agree with\nyoung ladies.\"\n\n\"I think they are taking to it pretty freely, then. We have\nunprotected young women all about the world.\"\n\n\"And great bores you find them, I suppose?\"\n\n\"No; I like it. The more we can get out of old-fashioned grooves the\nbetter I am pleased. I should be a radical to-morrow--a regular man\nof the people,--only I should break my mother's heart.\"\n\n\"Whatever you do, Lord Lufton, do not do that.\"\n\n\"That is why I have liked you so much,\" he continued, \"because you\nget out of the grooves.\"\n\n\"Do I?\"\n\n\"Yes; and go along by yourself, guiding your own footsteps; not\ncarried hither and thither, just as your grandmother's old tramway\nmay chance to take you.\"\n\n\"Do you know I have a strong idea that my grandmother's old tramway\nwill be the safest and the best after all? I have not left it very\nfar, and I certainly mean to go back to it.\"\n\n\"That's impossible! An army of old women, with coils of ropes made\nout of time-honoured prejudices, could not drag you back.\"\n\n\"No, Lord Lufton, that is true. But one--\" and then she stopped\nherself. She could not tell him that one loving mother, anxious for\nher only son, had sufficed to do it. She could not explain to him\nthat this departure from the established tramway had already broken\nher own rest, and turned her peaceful happy life into a grievous\nbattle.\n\n\"I know that you are trying to go back,\" he said. \"Do you think that\nI have eyes and cannot see? Come, Lucy, you and I have been friends,\nand we must not part in this way. My mother is a paragon among women.\nI say it in earnest;--a paragon among women: and her love for me is\nthe perfection of motherly love.\"\n\n\"It is, it is; and I am so glad that you acknowledge it.\"\n\n\"I should be worse than a brute did I not do so; but, nevertheless, I\ncannot allow her to lead me in all things. Were I to do so, I should\ncease to be a man.\"\n\n\"Where can you find any one who will counsel you so truly?\"\n\n\"But, nevertheless, I must rule myself. I do not know whether my\nsuspicions may be perfectly just, but I fancy that she has created\nthis estrangement between you and me. Has it not been so?\"\n\n\"Certainly not by speaking to me,\" said Lucy, blushing ruby-red\nthrough every vein of her deep-tinted face. But though she could not\ncommand her blood, her voice was still under her control--her voice\nand her manner.\n\n\"But has she not done so? You, I know, will tell me nothing but the\ntruth.\"\n\n\"I will tell you nothing on this matter, Lord Lufton, whether true or\nfalse. It is a subject on which it does not concern me to speak.\"\n\n\"Ah! I understand,\" he said; and rising from his chair, he stood\nagainst the chimney-piece with his back to the fire. \"She cannot\nleave me alone to choose for myself my own friends, and my own--;\"\nbut he did not fill up the void.\n\n\"But why tell me this, Lord Lufton?\"\n\n\"No! I am not to choose my own friends, though they be among the best\nand purest of God's creatures. Lucy, I cannot think that you have\nceased to have a regard for me. That you had a regard for me, I am\nsure.\"\n\nShe felt that it was almost unmanly of him thus to seek her out,\nand hunt her down, and then throw upon her the whole weight of\nthe explanation that his coming thither made necessary. But,\nnevertheless, the truth must be told, and with God's help she would\nfind strength for the telling of it.\n\n\"Yes, Lord Lufton, I had a regard for you--and have. By that word you\nmean something more than the customary feeling of acquaintance which\nmay ordinarily prevail between a gentleman and lady of different\nfamilies, who have known each other so short a time as we have done.\"\n\n\"Yes, something much more,\" said he, with energy.\n\n\"Well, I will not define the much--something closer than that.\"\n\n\"Yes, and warmer, and dearer, and more worthy of two human creatures\nwho value each other's minds and hearts.\"\n\n\"Some such closer regard I have felt for you--very foolishly. Stop!\nYou have made me speak, and do not interrupt me now. Does not your\nconscience tell you that in doing so I have unwisely deserted\nthose wise old grandmother's tramways of which you spoke just now?\nIt has been pleasant to me to do so. I have liked the feeling of\nindependence with which I have thought that I might indulge in an\nopen friendship with such as you are. And your rank, so different\nfrom my own, has doubtless made this more attractive.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\"\n\n\"Ah! but it has. I know it now. But what will the world say of me as\nto such an alliance?\"\n\n\"The world!\"\n\n\"Yes, the world! I am not such a philosopher as to disregard it,\nthough you may afford to do so. The world will say that I, the\nparson's sister, set my cap at the young lord, and that the young\nlord had made a fool of me.\"\n\n\"The world shall say no such thing!\" said Lord Lufton, very\nimperiously.\n\n\"Ah! but it will. You can no more stop it, than King Canute could the\nwaters. Your mother has interfered wisely to spare me from this; and\nthe only favour that I can ask you is, that you will spare me also.\"\nAnd then she got up as though she intended at once to walk forth to\nher visit to Mrs. Podgens' baby.\n\n\"Stop, Lucy!\" he said, putting himself between her and the door.\n\n\"It must not be Lucy any longer, Lord Lufton; I was madly foolish\nwhen I first allowed it.\"\n\n\"By heavens! but it shall be Lucy--Lucy before all the world. My\nLucy, my own Lucy--my heart's best friend, and chosen love. Lucy,\nthere is my hand. How long you may have had my heart, it matters not\nto say now.\"\n\nThe game was at her feet now, and no doubt she felt her triumph. Her\nready wit and speaking lip, not her beauty, had brought him to her\nside; and now he was forced to acknowledge that her power over him\nhad been supreme. Sooner than leave her he would risk all. She did\nfeel her triumph; but there was nothing in her face to tell him that\nshe did so.\n\nAs to what she would now do she did not for a moment doubt. He had\nbeen precipitated into the declaration he had made, not by his love,\nbut by his embarrassment. She had thrown in his teeth the injury\nwhich he had done her, and he had then been moved by his generosity\nto repair that injury by the noblest sacrifice which he could make.\nBut Lucy Robarts was not the girl to accept a sacrifice.\n\nHe had stepped forward as though he were going to clasp her round the\nwaist, but she receded, and got beyond the reach of his hand. \"Lord\nLufton!\" she said, \"when you are more cool you will know that this is\nwrong. The best thing for both of us now is to part.\"\n\n\"Not the best thing, but the very worst, till we perfectly understand\neach other.\"\n\n\"Then perfectly understand me, that I cannot be your wife.\"\n\n\"Lucy! do you mean that you cannot learn to love me?\"\n\n\"I mean that I shall not try. Do not persevere in this, or you will\nhave to hate yourself for your own folly.\"\n\n\"But I will persevere till you accept my love, or say with your hand\non your heart that you cannot and will not love me.\"\n\n\"Then I must beg you to let me go,\" and having so said, she paused\nwhile he walked once or twice hurriedly up and down the room. \"And,\nLord Lufton,\" she continued, \"if you will leave me now, the words\nthat you have spoken shall be as though they had never been uttered.\"\n\n\"I care not who knows that they have been uttered. The sooner that\nthey are known to all the world, the better I shall be pleased,\nunless indeed--\"\n\n\"Think of your mother, Lord Lufton.\"\n\n\"What can I do better than give her as a daughter the best and\nsweetest girl I have ever met? When my mother really knows you, she\nwill love you as I do. Lucy, say one word to me of comfort.\"\n\n\"I will say no word to you that shall injure your future comfort. It\nis impossible that I should be your wife.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that you cannot love me?\"\n\n\"You have no right to press me any further,\" she said; and sat down\nupon the sofa, with an angry frown upon her forehead.\n\n\"By heavens,\" he said, \"I will take no such answer from you till you\nput your hand upon your heart, and say that you cannot love me.\"\n\n\"Oh, why should you press me so, Lord Lufton?\"\n\n\"Why! because my happiness depends upon it; because it behoves me to\nknow the very truth. It has come to this, that I love you with my\nwhole heart, and I must know how your heart stands towards me.\"\n\nShe had now again risen from the sofa, and was looking steadily in\nhis face.\n\n\"Lord Lufton,\" she said, \"I cannot love you,\" and as she spoke she\ndid put her hand, as he had desired, upon her heart.\n\n\"Then God help me! for I am very wretched. Good-bye, Lucy,\" and he\nstretched out his hand to her.\n\n\"Good-bye, my lord. Do not be angry with me.\"\n\n\"No, no, no!\" and without further speech he left the room and the\nhouse, and hurried home. It was hardly surprising that he should that\nevening tell his mother that Griselda Grantly would be a companion\nsufficiently good for his sister. He wanted no such companion.\n\nAnd when he was well gone--absolutely out of sight from the\nwindow--Lucy walked steadily up to her room, locked the door, and\nthen threw herself on the bed. Why--oh! why had she told such\na falsehood? Could anything justify her in a lie? Was it not a\nlie--knowing as she did that she loved him with all her loving heart?\n\n\n[Illustration: \"Was it not a lie?\"]\n\n\nBut, then, his mother! and the sneers of the world, which would have\ndeclared that she had set her trap, and caught the foolish young\nlord! Her pride would not have submitted to that. Strong as her love\nwas, yet her pride was, perhaps, stronger--stronger at any rate\nduring that interview.\n\nBut how was she to forgive herself the falsehood she had told?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\nMRS. PROUDIE'S CONVERSAZIONE.\n\n\nIt was grievous to think of the mischief and danger into which\nGriselda Grantly was brought by the worldliness of her mother in\nthose few weeks previous to Lady Lufton's arrival in town--very\ngrievous, at least, to her ladyship, as from time to time she heard\nof what was done in London. Lady Hartletop's was not the only\nobjectionable house at which Griselda was allowed to reap fresh\nfashionable laurels. It had been stated openly in the _Morning Post_\nthat that young lady had been the most admired among the beautiful at\none of Miss Dunstable's celebrated _soir\u00c3\u00a9es_, and then she was heard\nof as gracing the drawing-room at Mrs. Proudie's conversazione.\n\nOf Miss Dunstable herself Lady Lufton was not able openly to allege\nany evil. She was acquainted, Lady Lufton knew, with very many people\nof the right sort, and was the dear friend of Lady Lufton's highly\nconservative and not very distant neighbours, the Greshams. But then\nshe was also acquainted with so many people of the bad sort. Indeed,\nshe was intimate with everybody, from the Duke of Omnium to old\nDowager Lady Goodygaffer, who had represented all the cardinal\nvirtues for the last quarter of a century. She smiled with equal\nsweetness on treacle and on brimstone; was quite at home at Exeter\nHall, having been consulted--so the world said, probably not with\nexact truth--as to the selection of more than one disagreeably Low\nChurch bishop; and was not less frequent in her attendance at the\necclesiastical doings of a certain terrible prelate in the Midland\ncounties, who was supposed to favour stoles and vespers, and to have\nno proper Protestant hatred for auricular confession and fish on\nFridays. Lady Lufton, who was very staunch, did not like this, and\nwould say of Miss Dunstable that it was impossible to serve both God\nand Mammon.\n\nBut Mrs. Proudie was much more objectionable to her. Seeing how\nsharp was the feud between the Proudies and the Grantlys down in\nBarsetshire, how absolutely unable they had always been to carry a\ndecent face towards each other in church matters, how they headed two\nparties in the diocese, which were, when brought together, as oil and\nvinegar, in which battles the whole Lufton influence had always been\nbrought to bear on the Grantly side;--seeing all this, I say, Lady\nLufton was surprised to hear that Griselda had been taken to Mrs.\nProudie's evening exhibition. \"Had the archdeacon been consulted\nabout it,\" she said to herself, \"this would never have happened.\"\nBut there she was wrong, for in matters concerning his daughter's\nintroduction to the world the archdeacon never interfered.\n\nOn the whole, I am inclined to think that Mrs. Grantly understood\nthe world better than did Lady Lufton. In her heart of hearts Mrs.\nGrantly hated Mrs. Proudie--that is, with that sort of hatred one\nChristian lady allows herself to feel towards another. Of course Mrs.\nGrantly forgave Mrs. Proudie all her offences, and wished her well,\nand was at peace with her, in the Christian sense of the word, as\nwith all other women. But under this forbearance and meekness, and\nperhaps, we may say, wholly unconnected with it, there was certainly\na current of antagonistic feeling which, in the ordinary unconsidered\nlanguage of every day, men and women do call hatred. This raged and\nwas strong throughout the whole year in Barsetshire, before the eyes\nof all mankind. But, nevertheless, Mrs. Grantly took Griselda to Mrs.\nProudie's evening parties in London.\n\nIn these days Mrs. Proudie considered herself to be by no means the\nleast among bishops' wives. She had opened the season this year in a\nnew house in Gloucester Place, at which the reception rooms, at any\nrate, were all that a lady bishop could desire. Here she had a front\ndrawing-room of very noble dimensions, a second drawing-room rather\nnoble also, though it had lost one of its back corners awkwardly\nenough, apparently in a jostle with the neighbouring house; and then\nthere was a third--shall we say drawing-room, or closet?--in which\nMrs. Proudie delighted to be seen sitting, in order that the world\nmight know that there was a third room; altogether a noble suite, as\nMrs. Proudie herself said in confidence to more than one clergyman's\nwife from Barsetshire. \"A noble suite, indeed, Mrs. Proudie!\" the\nclergymen's wives from Barsetshire would usually answer.\n\nFor some time Mrs. Proudie was much at a loss to know by what sort\nof party or entertainment she would make herself famous. Balls and\nsuppers were of course out of the question. She did not object to\nher daughters dancing all night at other houses--at least, of late\nshe had not objected, for the fashionable world required it, and the\nyoung ladies had perhaps a will of their own--but dancing at her\nhouse--absolutely under the shade of the bishop's apron--would be a\nsin and a scandal. And then as to suppers--of all modes in which one\nmay extend one's hospitality to a large acquaintance, they are the\nmost costly.\n\n\"It is horrid to think that we should go out among our friends for\nthe mere sake of eating and drinking,\" Mrs. Proudie would say to\nthe clergymen's wives from Barsetshire. \"It shows such a sensual\npropensity.\"\n\n\"Indeed it does, Mrs. Proudie; and is so vulgar too!\" those ladies\nwould reply.\n\nBut the elder among them would remember with regret the unsparing,\nopen-handed hospitality of Barchester palace in the good old days of\nBishop Grantly--God rest his soul! One old vicar's wife there was\nwhose answer had not been so courteous--\n\n\"When we are hungry, Mrs. Proudie,\" she had said, \"we do all have\nsensual propensities.\"\n\n\"It would be much better, Mrs. Athill, if the world would provide\nfor all that at home,\" Mrs. Proudie had rapidly replied; with which\nopinion I must here profess that I cannot by any means bring myself\nto coincide.\n\nBut a conversazione would give play to no sensual propensity, nor\noccasion that intolerable expense which the gratification of sensual\npropensities too often produces. Mrs. Proudie felt that the word was\nnot all that she could have desired. It was a little faded by old use\nand present oblivion, and seemed to address itself to that portion\nof the London world that is considered blue, rather than fashionable.\nBut, nevertheless, there was a spirituality about it which suited\nher, and one may also say an economy. And then as regarded fashion,\nit might perhaps not be beyond the power of a Mrs. Proudie to regild\nthe word with a newly burnished gilding. Some leading person must\nproduce fashion at first hand, and why not Mrs. Proudie?\n\nHer plan was to set the people by the ears talking, if talk they\nwould, or to induce them to show themselves there inert if no more\ncould be got from them. To accommodate with chairs and sofas as many\nas the furniture of her noble suite of rooms would allow, especially\nwith the two chairs and padded bench against the wall in the back\ncloset--the small inner drawing-room, as she would call it to the\nclergymen's wives from Barsetshire--and to let the others stand\nabout upright, or \"group themselves,\" as she described it. Then four\ntimes during the two hours' period of her conversazione tea and cake\nwere to be handed round on salvers. It is astonishing how far a\nvery little cake will go in this way, particularly if administered\ntolerably early after dinner. The men can't eat it, and the women,\nhaving no plates and no table, are obliged to abstain. Mrs. Jones\nknows that she cannot hold a piece of crumbly cake in her hand till\nit be consumed without doing serious injury to her best dress. When\nMrs. Proudie, with her weekly books before her, looked into the\nfinancial upshot of her conversazione, her conscience told her that\nshe had done the right thing.\n\nGoing out to tea is not a bad thing, if one can contrive to dine\nearly, and then be allowed to sit round a big table with a tea\nurn in the middle. I would, however, suggest that breakfast cups\nshould always be provided for the gentlemen. And then with pleasant\nneighbours,--or more especially with a pleasant neighbour,--the\naffair is not, according to my taste, by any means the worst phase\nof society. But I do dislike that handing round, unless it be of a\nsubsidiary thimbleful when the business of the social intercourse has\nbeen dinner.\n\nAnd indeed this handing round has become a vulgar and an intolerable\nnuisance among us second-class gentry with our eight hundred a\nyear--there or thereabouts;--doubly intolerable as being destructive\nof our natural comforts, and a wretchedly vulgar aping of men\nwith large incomes. The Duke of Omnium and Lady Hartletop are\nundoubtedly wise to have everything handed round. Friends of mine who\noccasionally dine at such houses tell me that they get their wine\nquite as quickly as they can drink it, that their mutton is brought\nto them without delay, and that the potato-bearer follows quick upon\nthe heels of carnifer. Nothing can be more comfortable, and we may no\ndoubt acknowledge that these first-class grandees do understand their\nmaterial comforts. But we of the eight hundred can no more come up to\nthem in this than we can in their opera-boxes and equipages. May I\nnot say that the usual tether of this class, in the way of carnifers,\ncup-bearers, and the rest, does not reach beyond neat-handed Phyllis\nand the greengrocer? and that Phyllis, neat-handed as she probably\nis, and the greengrocer, though he be ever so active, cannot\nadminister a dinner to twelve people who are prohibited by a\nMedo-Persian law from all self-administration whatever? And may I not\nfurther say that the lamentable consequence to us eight hundreders\ndining out among each other is this, that we too often get no dinner\nat all. Phyllis, with the potatoes, cannot reach us till our mutton\nis devoured, or in a lukewarm state past our power of managing; and\nGanymede, the greengrocer, though we admire the skill of his necktie\nand the whiteness of his unexceptionable gloves, fails to keep us\ngoing in Sherry.\n\nSeeing a lady the other day in this strait, left without a small\nmodicum of stimulus which was no doubt necessary for her good\ndigestion, I ventured to ask her to drink wine with me. But when I\nbowed my head at her, she looked at me with all her eyes, struck with\namazement. Had I suggested that she should join me in a wild Indian\nwar-dance, with nothing on but my paint, her face could not have\nshown greater astonishment. And yet I should have thought she might\nhave remembered the days when Christian men and women used to drink\nwine with each other.\n\nGod be with the good old days when I could hobnob with my friend over\nthe table as often as I was inclined to lift my glass to my lips, and\nmake a long arm for a hot potato whenever the exigencies of my plate\nrequired it.\n\nI think it may be laid down as a rule in affairs of hospitality, that\nwhatever extra luxury or grandeur we introduce at our tables when\nguests are with us, should be introduced for the advantage of the\nguest and not for our own. If, for instance, our dinner be served in\na manner different from that usual to us, it should be so served in\norder that our friends may with more satisfaction eat our repast than\nour everyday practice would produce on them. But the change should\nby no means be made to their material detriment in order that our\nfashion may be acknowledged. Again, if I decorate my sideboard and\ntable, wishing that the eyes of my visitors may rest on that which\nis elegant and pleasant to the sight, I act in that matter with\na becoming sense of hospitality; but if my object be to kill Mrs.\nJones with envy at the sight of all my silver trinkets, I am a very\nmean-spirited fellow. This, in a broad way, will be acknowledged; but\nif we would bear in mind the same idea at all times,--on occasions\nwhen the way perhaps may not be so broad, when more thinking may\nbe required to ascertain what is true hospitality,--I think we\nof the eight hundred would make a greater advance towards really\nentertaining our own friends than by any rearrangement of the actual\nmeats and dishes which we set before them.\n\nKnowing as we do, that the terms of the Lufton-Grantly alliance had\nbeen so solemnly ratified between the two mothers, it is perhaps\nhardly open to us to suppose that Mrs. Grantly was induced to take\nher daughter to Mrs. Proudie's by any knowledge which she may have\nacquired that Lord Dumbello had promised to grace the bishop's\nassembly. It is certainly the fact that high contracting parties\ndo sometimes allow themselves a latitude which would be considered\ndishonest by contractors of a lower sort; and it may be possible that\nthe archdeacon's wife did think of that second string with which\nher bow was furnished. Be that as it may, Lord Dumbello was at Mrs.\nProudie's, and it did so come to pass that Griselda was seated at\nthe corner of a sofa close to which was a vacant space in which his\nlordship could--\"group himself.\"\n\nThey had not been long there before Lord Dumbello did group himself.\n\"Fine day,\" he said, coming up and occupying the vacant position by\nMiss Grantly's elbow.\n\n\"We were driving to-day, and we thought it rather cold,\" said\nGriselda.\n\n\"Deuced cold,\" said Lord Dumbello, and then he adjusted his white\ncravat and touched up his whiskers. Having got so far, he did not\nproceed to any other immediate conversational efforts; nor did\nGriselda. But he grouped himself again as became a marquis, and gave\nvery intense satisfaction to Mrs. Proudie.\n\n\"This is so kind of you, Lord Dumbello,\" said that lady, coming up to\nhim and shaking his hand warmly; \"so very kind of you to come to my\npoor little tea-party.\"\n\n\"Uncommonly pleasant, I call it,\" said his lordship. \"I like this\nsort of thing--no trouble, you know.\"\n\n\"No; that is the charm of it: isn't it? no trouble, or fuss,\nor parade. That's what I always say. According to my ideas,\nsociety consists in giving people facility for an interchange of\nthoughts--what we call conversation.\"\n\n\"Aw, yes, exactly.\"\n\n\"Not in eating and drinking together--eh, Lord Dumbello? And yet the\npractice of our lives would seem to show that the indulgence of those\nanimal propensities can alone suffice to bring people together. The\nworld in this has surely made a great mistake.\"\n\n\"I like a good dinner all the same,\" said Lord Dumbello.\n\n\"Oh, yes, of course--of course. I am by no means one of those who\nwould pretend to preach that our tastes have not been given to us for\nour enjoyment. Why should things be nice if we are not to like them?\"\n\n\"A man who can really give a good dinner has learned a great deal,\"\nsaid Lord Dumbello, with unusual animation.\n\n\"An immense deal. It is quite an art in itself; and one which I, at\nany rate, by no means despise. But we cannot always be eating--can\nwe?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Lord Dumbello, \"not always.\" And he looked as though he\nlamented that his powers should be so circumscribed.\n\nAnd then Mrs. Proudie passed on to Mrs. Grantly. The two ladies were\nquite friendly in London; though down in their own neighbourhood\nthey waged a war so internecine in its nature. But nevertheless Mrs.\nProudie's manner might have showed to a very close observer that she\nknew the difference between a bishop and an archdeacon. \"I am so\ndelighted to see you,\" said she. \"No, don't mind moving; I won't sit\ndown just at present. But why didn't the archdeacon come?\"\n\n\"It was quite impossible; it was indeed,\" said Mrs. Grantly. \"The\narchdeacon never has a moment in London that he can call his own.\"\n\n\"You don't stay up very long, I believe.\"\n\n\"A good deal longer than we either of us like, I can assure you.\nLondon life is a perfect nuisance to me.\"\n\n\"But people in a certain position must go through with it, you know,\"\nsaid Mrs. Proudie. \"The bishop, for instance, must attend the House.\"\n\n\"Must he?\" asked Mrs. Grantly, as though she were not at all well\ninformed with reference to this branch of a bishop's business. \"I am\nvery glad that archdeacons are under no such liability.\"\n\n\"Oh, no; there's nothing of that sort,\" said Mrs. Proudie, very\nseriously. \"But how uncommonly well Miss Grantly is looking! I do\nhear that she has quite been admired.\"\n\nThis phrase certainly was a little hard for the mother to bear. All\nthe world had acknowledged, so Mrs. Grantly had taught herself to\nbelieve, that Griselda was undoubtedly the beauty of the season.\nMarquises and lords were already contending for her smiles, and\nparagraphs had been written in newspapers as to her profile. It was\ntoo hard to be told, after that, that her daughter had been \"quite\nadmired.\" Such a phrase might suit a pretty little red-cheeked\nmilkmaid of a girl.\n\n\"She cannot, of course, come near your girls in that respect,\" said\nMrs. Grantly, very quietly. Now the Miss Proudies had not elicited\nfrom the fashionable world any very loud encomiums on their beauty.\nTheir mother felt the taunt in its fullest force, but she would not\nessay to do battle on the present arena. She jotted down the item in\nher mind, and kept it over for Barchester and the chapter. Such debts\nas those she usually paid on some day, if the means of doing so were\nat all within her power.\n\n\"But there is Miss Dunstable, I declare,\" she said, seeing that that\nlady had entered the room; and away went Mrs. Proudie to welcome her\ndistinguished guest.\n\n\"And so this is a conversazione, is it?\" said that lady, speaking, as\nusual, not in a suppressed voice. \"Well, I declare, it's very nice.\nIt means conversation, don't it, Mrs. Proudie?\"\n\n\"Ha, ha, ha! Miss Dunstable, there is nobody like you, I declare.\"\n\n\"Well, but don't it? and tea and cake? and then, when we're tired of\ntalking, we go away,--isn't that it?\"\n\n\"But you must not be tired for these three hours yet.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm never tired of talking; all the world knows that. How do,\nbishop? A very nice sort of thing this conversazione, isn't it now?\"\n\nThe bishop rubbed his hands together and smiled, and said that he\nthought it was rather nice.\n\n\"Mrs. Proudie is so fortunate in all her little arrangements,\" said\nMiss Dunstable.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said the bishop. \"I think she is happy in these matters.\nI do flatter myself that she is so. Of course, Miss Dunstable, you\nare accustomed to things on a much grander scale.\"\n\n\"I! Lord bless you, no! Nobody hates grandeur so much as I do. Of\ncourse I must do as I am told. I must live in a big House, and have\nthree footmen six feet high. I must have a coachman with a top-heavy\nwig, and horses so big that they frighten me. If I did not, I should\nbe made out a lunatic and declared unable to manage my own affairs.\nBut as for grandeur, I hate it. I certainly think that I shall have\nsome of these conversaziones. I wonder whether Mrs. Proudie will come\nand put me up to a wrinkle or two.\"\n\nThe bishop again rubbed his hands, and said that he was sure she\nwould. He never felt quite at his ease with Miss Dunstable, as he\nrarely could ascertain whether or no she was earnest in what she was\nsaying. So he trotted off, muttering some excuse as he went, and\nMiss Dunstable chuckled with an inward chuckle at his too evident\nbewilderment. Miss Dunstable was by nature kind, generous, and\nopen-hearted; but she was living now very much with people on whom\nkindness, generosity, and open-heartedness were thrown away. She\nwas clever also, and could be sarcastic; and she found that those\nqualities told better in the world around her than generosity and an\nopen heart. And so she went on from month to month, and year to year,\nnot progressing in a good spirit as she might have done, but still\ncarrying within her bosom a warm affection for those she could\nreally love. And she knew that she was hardly living as she should\nlive,--that the wealth which she affected to despise was eating into\nthe soundness of her character, not by its splendour, but by the\nstyle of life which it had seemed to produce as a necessity. She knew\nthat she was gradually becoming irreverent, scornful, and prone to\nridicule; but yet, knowing this and hating it, she hardly knew how to\nbreak from it.\n\nShe had seen so much of the blacker side of human nature that\nblackness no longer startled her as it should do. She had been the\nprize at which so many ruined spendthrifts had aimed; so many pirates\nhad endeavoured to run her down while sailing in the open waters of\nlife, that she had ceased to regard such attempts on her money-bags\nas unmanly or over-covetous. She was content to fight her own battle\nwith her own weapons, feeling secure in her own strength of purpose\nand strength of wit.\n\nSome few friends she had whom she really loved,--among whom her inner\nself could come out and speak boldly what it had to say with its own\ntrue voice. And the woman who thus so spoke was very different from\nthat Miss Dunstable whom Mrs. Proudie courted, and the Duke of Omnium\nf\u00c3\u00aated, and Mrs. Harold Smith claimed as her bosom friend. If only she\ncould find among such one special companion on whom her heart might\nrest, who would help her to bear the heavy burdens of her world!\nBut where was she to find such a friend?--she with her keen wit,\nher untold money, and loud laughing voice. Everything about her was\ncalculated to attract those whom she could not value, and to scare\nfrom her the sort of friend to whom she would fain have linked her\nlot.\n\nAnd then she met Mrs. Harold Smith, who had taken Mrs. Proudie's\nnoble suite of rooms in her tour for the evening, and was devoting\nto them a period of twenty minutes. \"And so I may congratulate you,\"\nMiss Dunstable said eagerly to her friend.\n\n\"No, in mercy's name do no such thing, or you may too probably have\nto uncongratulate me again; and that will be so unpleasant.\"\n\n\"But they told me that Lord Brock had sent for him yesterday.\" Now at\nthis period Lord Brock was Prime Minister.\n\n\"So he did, and Harold was with him backwards and forwards all the\nday. But he can't shut his eyes and open his mouth, and see what God\nwill send him, as a wise and prudent man should do. He is always for\nbargaining, and no Prime Minister likes that.\"\n\n\"I would not be in his shoes if, after all, he has to come home and\nsay that the bargain is off.\"\n\n\"Ha, ha, ha! Well, I should not take it very quietly. But what can we\npoor women do, you know? When it is settled, my dear, I'll send you a\nline at once.\" And then Mrs. Harold Smith finished her course round\nthe rooms, and regained her carriage within the twenty minutes.\n\n\"Beautiful profile, has she not?\" said Miss Dunstable, somewhat later\nin the evening, to Mrs. Proudie. Of course, the profile spoken of\nbelonged to Miss Grantly.\n\n\"Yes, it is beautiful, certainly,\" said Mrs. Proudie. \"The pity is\nthat it means nothing.\"\n\n\"The gentlemen seem to think that it means a good deal.\"\n\n\"I am not sure of that. She has no conversation, you see; not a word.\nShe has been sitting there with Lord Dumbello at her elbow for the\nlast hour, and yet she has hardly opened her mouth three times.\"\n\n\"But, my dear Mrs. Proudie, who on earth could talk to Lord\nDumbello?\"\n\nMrs. Proudie thought that her own daughter Olivia would undoubtedly\nbe able to do so, if only she could get the opportunity. But, then,\nOlivia had so much conversation.\n\nAnd while the two ladies were yet looking at the youthful pair, Lord\nDumbello did speak again. \"I think I have had enough of this now,\"\nsaid he, addressing himself to Griselda.\n\n\"I suppose you have other engagements,\" said she.\n\n\"Oh, yes; and I believe I shall go to Lady Clantelbrocks.\" And then\nhe took his departure. No other word was spoken that evening between\nhim and Miss Grantly beyond those given in this chronicle, and yet\nthe world declared that he and that young lady had passed the evening\nin so close a flirtation as to make the matter more than ordinarily\nparticular; and Mrs. Grantly, as she was driven home to her lodgings,\nbegan to have doubts in her mind whether it would be wise to\ndiscountenance so great an alliance as that which the head of the\ngreat Hartletop family now seemed so desirous to establish. The\nprudent mother had not yet spoken a word to her daughter on these\nsubjects, but it might soon become necessary to do so. It was all\nvery well for Lady Lufton to hurry up to town, but of what service\nwould that be, if Lord Lufton were not to be found in Bruton Street?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\nTHE NEW MINISTER'S PATRONAGE.\n\n\nAt that time, just as Lady Lufton was about to leave Framley for\nLondon, Mark Robarts received a pressing letter, inviting him also to\ngo up to the metropolis for a day or two--not for pleasure, but on\nbusiness. The letter was from his indefatigable friend Sowerby.\n\n\"My dear Robarts,\" the letter ran:--\n\n\n   I have just heard that poor little Burslem, the\n   Barsetshire prebendary, is dead. We must all die some day,\n   you know,--as you have told your parishioners from the\n   Framley pulpit more than once, no doubt. The stall must\n   be filled up, and why should not you have it as well as\n   another? It is six hundred a year and a house. Little\n   Burslem had nine, but the good old times are gone.\n   Whether the house is letable or not under the present\n   ecclesiastical r\u00c3\u00a9gime, I do not know. It used to be so,\n   for I remember Mrs. Wiggins, the tallow-chandler's widow,\n   living in old Stanhope's house.\n\n   Harold Smith has just joined the Government as Lord Petty\n   Bag, and could, I think, at the present moment get this\n   for asking. He cannot well refuse me, and, if you will\n   say the word, I will speak to him. You had better come up\n   yourself; but say the word \"Yes,\" or \"No,\" by the wires.\n\n   If you say \"Yes,\" as of course you will, do not fail to\n   come up. You will find me at the \"Travellers,\" or at the\n   House. The stall will just suit you,--will give you no\n   trouble, improve your position, and give some little\n   assistance towards bed and board, and rack and manger.\n\n   Yours ever faithfully,\n\n   N. SOWERBY.\n\n   Singularly enough, I hear that your brother is private\n   secretary to the new Lord Petty Bag. I am told that his\n   chief duty will consist in desiring the servants to call\n   my sister's carriage. I have only seen Harold once since\n   he accepted office; but my Lady Petty Bag says that he has\n   certainly grown an inch since that occurrence.\n\n\nThis was certainly very good-natured on the part of Mr. Sowerby, and\nshowed that he had a feeling within his bosom that he owed something\nto his friend the parson for the injury he had done him. And such\nwas in truth the case. A more reckless being than the member for\nWest Barsetshire could not exist. He was reckless for himself, and\nreckless for all others with whom he might be concerned. He could\nruin his friends with as little remorse as he had ruined himself. All\nwas fair game that came in the way of his net. But, nevertheless, he\nwas good-natured, and willing to move heaven and earth to do a friend\na good turn, if it came in his way to do so.\n\nHe did really love Mark Robarts as much as it was given him to love\nany among his acquaintance. He knew that he had already done him an\nalmost irreparable injury, and might very probably injure him still\ndeeper before he had done with him. That he would undoubtedly do so,\nif it came in his way, was very certain. But then, if it also came\nin his way to repay his friend by any side blow, he would also\nundoubtedly do that. Such an occasion had now come, and he had\ndesired his sister to give the new Lord Petty Bag no rest till he\nshould have promised to use all his influence in getting the vacant\nprebend for Mark Robarts.\n\nThis letter of Sowerby's Mark immediately showed to his wife. How\nlucky, thought he to himself, that not a word was said in it about\nthose accursed money transactions! Had he understood Sowerby better\nhe would have known that that gentleman never said anything about\nmoney transactions until it became absolutely necessary. \"I know you\ndon't like Mr. Sowerby,\" he said; \"but you must own that this is very\ngood-natured.\"\n\n\"It is the character I hear of him that I don't like,\" said Mrs.\nRobarts.\n\n\"But what shall I do now, Fanny? As he says, why should not I have\nthe stall as well as another?\"\n\n\"I suppose it would not interfere with your parish?\" she asked.\n\n\"Not in the least, at the distance at which we are. I did think of\ngiving up old Jones; but if I take this, of course I must keep a\ncurate.\"\n\nHis wife could not find it in her heart to dissuade him from\naccepting promotion when it came in his way--what vicar's wife would\nhave so persuaded her husband? But yet she did not altogether like\nit. She feared that Greek from Chaldicotes, even when he came with\nthe present of a prebendal stall in his hands. And then what would\nLady Lufton say?\n\n\"And do you think that you must go up to London, Mark?\"\n\n\"Oh, certainly; that is, if I intend to accept Harold Smith's kind\noffices in the matter.\"\n\n\"I suppose it will be better to accept them,\" said Fanny, feeling\nperhaps that it would be useless in her to hope that they should not\nbe accepted.\n\n\"Prebendal stalls, Fanny, don't generally go begging long among\nparish clergymen. How could I reconcile it to the duty I owe to my\nchildren to refuse such an increase to my income?\" And so it was\nsettled that he should at once drive to Silverbridge and send off a\nmessage by telegraph, and that he should himself proceed to London on\nthe following day. \"But you must see Lady Lufton first, of course,\"\nsaid Fanny, as soon as all this was settled.\n\nMark would have avoided this if he could have decently done so, but\nhe felt that it would be impolitic, as well as indecent. And why\nshould he be afraid to tell Lady Lufton that he hoped to receive this\npiece of promotion from the present government? There was nothing\ndisgraceful in a clergyman becoming a prebendary of Barchester. Lady\nLufton herself had always been very civil to the prebendaries, and\nespecially to little Dr. Burslem, the meagre little man who had just\nnow paid the debt of nature. She had always been very fond of the\nchapter, and her original dislike to Bishop Proudie had been chiefly\nfounded on his interference with the cathedral clergy,--on his\ninterference, or on that of his wife or chaplain. Considering these\nthings Mark Robarts tried to make himself believe that Lady Lufton\nwould be delighted at his good fortune. But yet he did not believe\nit. She at any rate would revolt from the gift of the Greek of\nChaldicotes.\n\n\"Oh, indeed,\" she said, when the vicar had with some difficulty\nexplained to her all the circumstances of the case. \"Well, I\ncongratulate you, Mr. Robarts, on your powerful new patron.\"\n\n\"You will probably feel with me, Lady Lufton, that the benefice is\none which I can hold without any detriment to me in my position here\nat Framley,\" said he, prudently resolving to let the slur upon his\nfriends pass by unheeded.\n\n\"Well, I hope so. Of course, you are a very young man, Mr. Robarts,\nand these things have generally been given to clergymen more advanced\nin life.\"\n\n\"But you do not mean to say that you think I ought to refuse it?\"\n\n\"What my advice to you might be if you really came to me for advice,\nI am hardly prepared to say at so very short a notice. You seem to\nhave made up your mind, and therefore I need not consider it. As it\nis, I wish you joy, and hope that it may turn out to your advantage\nin every way.\"\n\n\"You understand, Lady Lufton, that I have by no means got it as yet.\"\n\n\"Oh, I thought it had been offered to you: I thought you spoke of\nthis new minister as having all that in his own hand.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear, no. What may be the amount of his influence in that\nrespect I do not at all know. But my correspondent assures me--\"\n\n\"Mr. Sowerby, you mean. Why don't you call him by his name?\"\n\n\"Mr. Sowerby assures me that Mr. Smith will ask for it; and thinks it\nmost probable that his request will be successful.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course. Mr. Sowerby and Mr. Harold Smith together would no\ndoubt be successful in anything. They are the sort of men who are\nsuccessful nowadays. Well, Mr. Robarts, I wish you joy.\" And she gave\nhim her hand in token of her sincerity.\n\nMark took her hand, resolving to say nothing further on that\noccasion. That Lady Lufton was not now cordial with him, as she used\nto be, he was well aware; and sooner or later he was determined\nto have the matter out with her. He would ask her why she now so\nconstantly met him with a taunt, and so seldom greeted him with that\nkind old affectionate smile which he knew and appreciated so well.\nThat she was honest and true, he was quite sure. If he asked her the\nquestion plainly, she would answer him openly. And if he could induce\nher to say that she would return to her old ways, return to them she\nwould in a hearty manner. But he could not do this just at present.\nIt was but a day or two since Mr. Crawley had been with him; and\nwas it not probable that Mr. Crawley had been sent thither by Lady\nLufton? His own hands were not clean enough for a remonstrance at the\npresent moment. He would cleanse them, and then he would remonstrate.\n\n\"Would you like to live part of the year in Barchester?\" he said to\nhis wife and sister that evening.\n\n\"I think that two houses are only a trouble,\" said his wife. \"And we\nhave been very happy here.\"\n\n\"I have always liked a cathedral town,\" said Lucy; \"and I am\nparticularly fond of the close.\"\n\n\"And Barchester-close is the closest of all closes,\" said Mark.\n\"There is not a single house within the gateways that does not belong\nto the chapter.\"\n\n\"But if we are to keep up two houses, the additional income will soon\nbe wasted,\" said Fanny prudently.\n\n\"The thing would be, to let the house furnished every summer,\" said\nLucy.\n\n\"But I must take my residence as the terms come,\" said the vicar;\n\"and I certainly should not like to be away from Framley all the\nwinter; I should never see anything of Lufton.\" And perhaps he\nthought of his hunting, and then thought again of that cleansing of\nhis hands.\n\n\"I should not a bit mind being away during the winter,\" said Lucy,\nthinking of what the last winter had done for her.\n\n\"But where on earth should we find money to furnish one of those\nlarge, old-fashioned houses? Pray, Mark, do not do anything rash.\"\nAnd the wife laid her hand affectionately on her husband's arm. In\nthis manner the question of the prebend was discussed between them on\nthe evening before he started for London.\n\nSuccess had at last crowned the earnest effort with which Harold\nSmith had carried on the political battle of his life for the last\nten years. The late Lord Petty Bag had resigned in disgust, having\nbeen unable to digest the Prime Minister's ideas on Indian Reform,\nand Mr. Harold Smith, after sundry hitches in the business, was\ninstalled in his place. It was said that Harold Smith was not\nexactly the man whom the Premier would himself have chosen for\nthat high office; but the Premier's hands were a good deal tied\nby circumstances. The last great appointment he had made had been\nterribly unpopular,--so much so as to subject him, popular as he\nundoubtedly was himself, to a screech from the whole nation. The\n_Jupiter_, with withering scorn, had asked whether vice of every kind\nwas to be considered, in these days of Queen Victoria, as a passport\nto the cabinet. Adverse members of both Houses had arrayed themselves\nin a pure panoply of morality, and thundered forth their sarcasms\nwith the indignant virtue and keen discontent of political Juvenals;\nand even his own friends had held up their hands in dismay. Under\nthese circumstances he had thought himself obliged in the present\ninstance to select a man who would not be especially objectionable\nto any party. Now Harold Smith lived with his wife, and his\ncircumstances were not more than ordinarily embarrassed. He kept no\nrace-horses; and, as Lord Brock now heard for the first time, gave\nlectures in provincial towns on popular subjects. He had a seat\nwhich was tolerably secure, and could talk to the House by the yard\nif required to do so. Moreover, Lord Brock had a great idea that\nthe whole machinery of his own ministry would break to pieces very\nspeedily. His own reputation was not bad, but it was insufficient\nfor himself and that lately selected friend of his. Under all these\ncircumstances combined, he chose Harold Smith to fill the vacant\noffice of Lord Petty Bag.\n\nAnd very proud the Lord Petty Bag was. For the last three or four\nmonths, he and Mr. Supplehouse had been agreeing to consign the\nministry to speedy perdition. \"This sort of dictatorship will never\ndo,\" Harold Smith had himself said, justifying that future vote\nof his as to want of confidence in the Queen's government. And Mr.\nSupplehouse in this matter had fully agreed with him. He was a Juno\nwhose form that wicked old Paris had utterly despised, and he, too,\nhad quite made up his mind as to the lobby in which he would be found\nwhen that day of vengeance should arrive. But now things were much\naltered in Harold Smith's views. The Premier had shown his wisdom\nin seeking for new strength where strength ought to be sought, and\nintroducing new blood into the body of his ministry. The people would\nnow feel fresh confidence, and probably the House also. As to Mr.\nSupplehouse--he would use all his influence on Supplehouse. But,\nafter all, Mr. Supplehouse was not everything.\n\nOn the morning after our vicar's arrival in London he attended at\nthe Petty Bag office. It was situated in the close neighbourhood\nof Downing Street and the higher governmental gods; and though the\nbuilding itself was not much, seeing that it was shored up on one\nside, that it bulged out in the front, was foul with smoke, dingy\nwith dirt, and was devoid of any single architectural grace or modern\nscientific improvement, nevertheless its position gave it a status in\nthe world which made the clerks in the Lord Petty Bag's office quite\nrespectable in their walk in life. Mark had seen his friend Sowerby\non the previous evening, and had then made an appointment with him\nfor the following morning at the new minister's office. And now he\nwas there a little before his time, in order that he might have a few\nmoments' chat with his brother.\n\nWhen Mark found himself in the private secretary's room he was quite\nastonished to see the change in his brother's appearance which the\nchange in his official rank had produced. Jack Robarts had been\na well-built, straight-legged, lissome young fellow, pleasant to\nthe eye because of his natural advantages, but rather given to a\nharum-skarum style of gait, and occasionally careless, not to say\nslovenly, in his dress. But now he was the very pink of perfection.\nHis jaunty frock-coat fitted him to perfection; not a hair of his\nhead was out of place; his waistcoat and trousers were glossy and\nnew, and his umbrella, which stood in the umbrella-stand in the\ncorner, was tight, and neat, and small, and natty.\n\n\"Well, John, you've become quite a great man,\" said his brother.\n\n\"I don't know much about that,\" said John; \"but I find that I have an\nenormous deal of fagging to go through.\"\n\n\"Do you mean work? I thought you had about the easiest berth in the\nwhole Civil Service.\"\n\n\"Ah! that's just the mistake that people make. Because we don't cover\nwhole reams of foolscap paper at the rate of fifteen lines to a page,\nand five words to a line, people think that we private secretaries\nhave got nothing to do. Look here,\" and he tossed over scornfully a\ndozen or so of little notes. \"I tell you what, Mark; it is no easy\nmatter to manage the patronage of a cabinet minister. Now I am bound\nto write to every one of these fellows a letter that will please him;\nand yet I shall refuse to every one of them the request which he\nasks.\"\n\n\"That must be difficult.\"\n\n\"Difficult is no word for it. But, after all, it consists chiefly in\nthe knack of the thing. One must have the wit 'from such a sharp and\nwaspish word as No to pluck the sting.' I do it every day, and I\nreally think that the people like it.\"\n\n\"Perhaps your refusals are better than other people's acquiescences.\"\n\n\"I don't mean that at all. We private secretaries have all to do the\nsame thing. Now, would you believe it? I have used up three lifts of\nnote-paper already in telling people that there is no vacancy for a\nlobby messenger in the Petty Bag office. Seven peeresses have asked\nfor it for their favourite footmen. But there--there's the Lord Petty\nBag!\"\n\nA bell rang and the private secretary, jumping up from his\nnote-paper, tripped away quickly to the great man's room.\n\n\"He'll see you at once,\" said he, returning. \"Buggins, show the\nReverend Mr. Robarts to the Lord Petty Bag.\"\n\nBuggins was the messenger for whose not vacant place all the\npeeresses were striving with so much animation. And then Mark,\nfollowing Buggins for two steps, was ushered into the next room.\n\nIf a man be altered by becoming a private secretary, he is much more\naltered by being made a cabinet minister. Robarts, as he entered the\nroom, could hardly believe that this was the same Harold Smith whom\nMrs. Proudie bothered so cruelly in the lecture-room at Barchester.\nThen he was cross, and touchy, and uneasy, and insignificant. Now,\nas he stood smiling on the hearthrug of his official fireplace, it\nwas quite pleasant to see the kind, patronizing smile which lighted\nup his features. He delighted to stand there, with his hands in\nhis trousers' pocket, the great man of the place, conscious of his\nlordship, and feeling himself every inch a minister. Sowerby had come\nwith him, and was standing a little in the background, from which\nposition he winked occasionally at the parson over the minister's\nshoulder.\n\n\"Ah, Robarts, delighted to see you. How odd, by-the-by, that your\nbrother should be my private secretary!\" Mark said that it was a\nsingular coincidence.\n\n\"A very smart young fellow, and, if he minds himself, he'll do well.\"\n\n\"I'm quite sure he'll do well,\" said Mark.\n\n\"Ah! well, yes; I think he will. And now, what can I do for you,\nRobarts?\"\n\nHereupon Mr. Sowerby struck in, making it apparent by his explanation\nthat Mr. Robarts himself by no means intended to ask for anything;\nbut that, as his friends had thought that this stall at Barchester\nmight be put into his hands with more fitness than in those of any\nother clergyman of the day, he was willing to accept the piece of\npreferment from a man whom he respected so much as he did the new\nLord Petty Bag.\n\nThe minister did not quite like this, as it restricted him from\nmuch of his condescension, and robbed him of the incense of a\npetition which he had expected Mark Robarts would make to him. But,\nnevertheless, he was very gracious.\n\n\"He could not take upon himself to declare,\" he said, \"what might be\nLord Brock's pleasure with reference to the preferment at Barchester\nwhich was vacant. He had certainly already spoken to his lordship\non the subject, and had perhaps some reason to believe that his own\nwishes would be consulted. No distinct promise had been made, but\nhe might perhaps go so far as to say that he expected such result.\nIf so, it would give him the greatest pleasure in the world to\ncongratulate Mr. Robarts on the possession of the stall--a stall\nwhich he was sure Mr. Robarts would fill with dignity, piety, and\nbrotherly love.\" And then, when he had finished, Mr. Sowerby gave a\nfinal wink, and said that he regarded the matter as settled.\n\n\"No, not settled, Nathaniel,\" said the cautious minister.\n\n\"It's the same thing,\" rejoined Sowerby. \"We all know what all\nthat flummery means. Men in office, Mark, never do make a distinct\npromise,--not even to themselves of the leg of mutton which is\nroasting before their kitchen fires. It is so necessary in these days\nto be safe; is it not, Harold?\"\n\n\"Most expedient,\" said Harold Smith, shaking his head wisely. \"Well,\nRobarts, who is it now?\" This he said to his private secretary,\nwho came to notice the arrival of some bigwig. \"Well, yes. I will\nsay good morning, with your leave, for I am a little hurried. And\nremember, Mr. Robarts, I will do what I can for you; but you must\ndistinctly understand that there is no promise.\"\n\n\"Oh, no promise at all,\" said Sowerby--\"of course not.\" And then,\nas he sauntered up Whitehall towards Charing Cross, with Robarts\non his arm, he again pressed upon him the sale of that invaluable\nhunter, who was eating his head off his shoulders in the stable at\nChaldicotes.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\nMONEY DEALINGS.\n\n\nMr. Sowerby, in his resolution to obtain this good gift for the Vicar\nof Framley, did not depend quite alone on the influence of his near\nconnection with the Lord Petty Bag. He felt the occasion to be one\non which he might endeavour to move even higher powers than that,\nand therefore he had opened the matter to the duke--not by direct\napplication, but through Mr. Fothergill. No man who understood\nmatters ever thought of going direct to the duke in such an affair as\nthat. If one wanted to speak about a woman or a horse or a picture\nthe duke could, on occasions, be affable enough.\n\nBut through Mr. Fothergill the duke was approached. It was\nrepresented, with some cunning, that this buying over of the Framley\nclergyman from the Lufton side would be a praiseworthy spoiling of\nthe Amalekites. The doing so would give the Omnium interest a hold\neven in the cathedral close. And then it was known to all men that\nMr. Robarts had considerable influence over Lord Lufton himself. So\nguided, the Duke of Omnium did say two words to the Prime Minister,\nand two words from the duke went a great way, even with Lord Brock.\nThe upshot of all this was, that Mark Robarts did get the stall; but\nhe did not hear the tidings of his success till some days after his\nreturn to Framley.\n\nMr. Sowerby did not forget to tell him of the great effort--the\nunusual effort, as he of Chaldicotes called it--which the duke had\nmade on the subject. \"I don't know when he has done such a thing\nbefore,\" said Sowerby; \"and you may be quite sure of this, he would\nnot have done it now, had you not gone to Gatherum Castle when he\nasked you: indeed, Fothergill would have known that it was vain to\nattempt it. And I'll tell you what, Mark--it does not do for me to\nmake little of my own nest, but I truly believe the duke's word will\nbe more efficacious than the Lord Petty Bag's solemn adjuration.\"\n\nMark, of course, expressed his gratitude in proper terms, and did buy\nthe horse for a hundred and thirty pounds. \"He's as well worth it,\"\nsaid Sowerby, \"as any animal that ever stood on four legs; and my\nonly reason for pressing him on you is, that when Tozer's day does\ncome round, I know you will have to stand to us to something about\nthat tune.\" It did not occur to Mark to ask him why the horse should\nnot be sold to some one else, and the money forthcoming in the\nregular way. But this would not have suited Mr. Sowerby.\n\nMark knew that the beast was good, and as he walked to his lodgings\nwas half proud of his new possession. But then, how would he justify\nit to his wife, or how introduce the animal into his stables without\nattempting any justification in the matter? And yet, looking to the\nabsolute amount of his income, surely he might feel himself entitled\nto buy a new horse when it suited him. He wondered what Mr. Crawley\nwould say when he heard of the new purchase. He had lately fallen\ninto a state of much wondering as to what his friends and neighbours\nwould say about him.\n\nHe had now been two days in town, and was to go down after breakfast\non the following morning so that he might reach home by Friday\nafternoon. But on that evening, just as he was going to bed, he was\nsurprised by Lord Lufton coming into the coffee-room at his hotel.\nHe walked in with a hurried step, his face was red, and it was clear\nthat he was very angry.\n\n\"Robarts,\" said he, walking up to his friend and taking the hand that\nwas extended to him, \"do you know anything about this man, Tozer?\"\n\n\"Tozer--what Tozer? I have heard Sowerby speak of such a man.\"\n\n\"Of course you have. If I do not mistake you have written to me about\nhim yourself.\"\n\n\"Very probably. I remember Sowerby mentioning the man with reference\nto your affairs. But why do you ask me?\"\n\n\"This man has not only written to me, but has absolutely forced his\nway into my rooms when I was dressing for dinner; and absolutely had\nthe impudence to tell me that if I did not honour some bill which he\nholds for eight hundred pounds he would proceed against me.\"\n\n\"But you settled all that matter with Sowerby?\"\n\n\"I did settle it at a very great cost to me. Sooner than have a fuss\nI paid him through the nose--like a fool that I was--everything that\nhe claimed. This is an absolute swindle, and if it goes on I will\nexpose it as such.\"\n\nRobarts looked round the room, but luckily there was not a soul in\nit but themselves. \"You do not mean to say that Sowerby is swindling\nyou?\" said the clergyman.\n\n\"It looks very like it,\" said Lord Lufton; \"and I tell you fairly\nthat I am not in a humour to endure any more of this sort of thing.\nSome years ago I made an ass of myself through that man's fault. But\nfour thousand pounds should have covered the whole of what I really\nlost. I have now paid more than three times that sum; and, by\nheavens! I will not pay more without exposing the whole affair.\"\n\n\"But, Lufton, I do not understand. What is this bill?--has it your\nname to it?\"\n\n\"Yes, it has: I'll not deny my name, and if there be absolute need I\nwill pay it; but if I do so, my lawyer shall sift it, and it shall go\nbefore a jury.\"\n\n\"But I thought all those bills were paid?\"\n\n\"I left it to Sowerby to get up the old bills when they were renewed,\nand now one of them that has in truth been already honoured is\nbrought against me.\"\n\nMark could not but think of the two documents which he himself had\nsigned, and both of which were now undoubtedly in the hands of Tozer,\nor of some other gentleman of the same profession;--which both\nmight be brought against him, the second as soon as he should have\nsatisfied the first. And then he remembered that Sowerby had said\nsomething to him about an outstanding bill, for the filling up of\nwhich some trifle must be paid, and of this he reminded Lord Lufton.\n\n\"And do you call eight hundred pounds a trifle? If so, I do not.\"\n\n\"They will probably make no such demand as that.\"\n\n\"But I tell you they do make such a demand, and have made it. The\nman whom I saw, and who told me that he was Tozer's friend, but who\nwas probably Tozer himself, positively swore to me that he would be\nobliged to take legal proceedings if the money were not forthcoming\nwithin a week or ten days. When I explained to him that it was an old\nbill that had been renewed, he declared that his friend had given\nfull value for it.\"\n\n\"Sowerby said that you would probably have to pay ten pounds to\nredeem it. I should offer the man some such sum as that.\"\n\n\"My intention is to offer the man nothing, but to leave the affair\nin the hands of my lawyer with instructions to him to spare\nnone;--neither myself nor any one else. I am not going to allow such\na man as Sowerby to squeeze me like an orange.\"\n\n\"But, Lufton, you seem as though you were angry with me.\"\n\n\"No, I am not. But I think it is as well to caution you about this\nman; my transactions with him lately have chiefly been through you,\nand therefore--\"\n\n\"But they have only been so through his and your wish: because I have\nbeen anxious to oblige you both. I hope you don't mean to say that I\nam concerned in these bills.\"\n\n\"I know that you are concerned in bills with him.\"\n\n\"Why, Lufton, am I to understand, then, that you are accusing me\nof having any interest in these transactions which you have called\nswindling?\"\n\n\"As far as I am concerned there has been swindling, and there is\nswindling going on now.\"\n\n\"But you do not answer my question. Do you bring any accusation\nagainst me? If so, I agree with you that you had better go to your\nlawyer.\"\n\n\"I think that is what I shall do.\"\n\n\"Very well. But upon the whole, I never heard of a more unreasonable\nman, or of one whose thoughts are more unjust than yours. Solely with\nthe view of assisting you, and solely at your request, I spoke to\nSowerby about these money transactions of yours. Then at his request,\nwhich originated out of your request, he using me as his ambassador\nto you, as you had used me as yours to him, I wrote and spoke to you.\nAnd now this is the upshot.\"\n\n\"I bring no accusation against you, Robarts; but I know you have\ndealings with this man. You have told me so yourself.\"\n\n\"Yes, at his request to accommodate him, I have put my name to a\nbill.\"\n\n\"Only to one?\"\n\n\"Only to one; and then to that same renewed, or not exactly to that\nsame, but to one which stands for it. The first was for four hundred\npounds; the last for five hundred.\"\n\n\"All which you will have to make good, and the world will of course\ntell you that you have paid that price for this stall at Barchester.\"\n\nThis was terrible to be borne. He had heard much lately which had\nfrightened and scared him, but nothing so terrible as this; nothing\nwhich so stunned him, or conveyed to his mind so frightful a reality\nof misery and ruin. He made no immediate answer, but standing on the\nhearthrug with his back to the fire, looked up the whole length of\nthe room. Hitherto his eyes had been fixed upon Lord Lufton's face,\nbut now it seemed to him as though he had but little more to do with\nLord Lufton. Lord Lufton and Lord Lufton's mother were neither now to\nbe counted among those who wished him well. Upon whom indeed could he\nnow count, except that wife of his bosom upon whom he was bringing\nall this wretchedness?\n\nIn that moment of agony ideas ran quickly through his brain. He would\nimmediately abandon this preferment at Barchester, of which it might\nbe said with so much colour that he had bought it. He would go to\nHarold Smith, and say positively that he declined it. Then he would\nreturn home and tell his wife all that had occurred;--tell the whole\nalso to Lady Lufton, if that might still be of any service. He would\nmake arrangement for the payment of both those bills as they might be\npresented, asking no questions as to the justice of the claim, making\nno complaint to any one, not even to Sowerby. He would put half his\nincome, if half were necessary, into the hands of Forrest the banker,\ntill all was paid. He would sell every horse he had. He would part\nwith his footman and groom, and at any rate strive like a man to get\nagain a firm footing on good ground. Then, at that moment, he loathed\nwith his whole soul the position in which he found himself placed,\nand his own folly which had placed him there. How could he reconcile\nit to his conscience that he was there in London with Sowerby and\nHarold Smith, petitioning for Church preferment to a man who should\nhave been altogether powerless in such a matter, buying horses,\nand arranging about past due bills? He did not reconcile it to his\nconscience. Mr. Crawley had been right when he told him that he was a\ncastaway.\n\nLord Lufton, whose anger during the whole interview had been extreme,\nand who had become more angry the more he talked, had now walked once\nor twice up and down the room; and as he so walked the idea did occur\nto him that he had been unjust. He had come there with the intention\nof exclaiming against Sowerby, and of inducing Robarts to convey to\nthat gentleman, that if he, Lord Lufton, were made to undergo any\nfurther annoyance about this bill, the whole affair should be thrown\ninto the lawyer's hands; but instead of doing this, he had brought\nan accusation against Robarts. That Robarts had latterly become\nSowerby's friend rather than his own in all these horrid money\ndealings, had galled him; and now he had expressed himself in terms\nmuch stronger than he had intended to use.\n\n\"As to you personally, Mark,\" he said, coming back to the spot on\nwhich Robarts was standing, \"I do not wish to say anything that shall\nannoy you.\"\n\n\"You have said quite enough, Lord Lufton.\"\n\n\"You cannot be surprised that I should be angry and indignant at the\ntreatment I have received.\"\n\n\"You might, I think, have separated in your mind those who have\nwronged you, if there has been such wrong, from those who have\nonly endeavoured to do your will and pleasure for you. That I, as\na clergyman, have been very wrong in taking any part whatsoever\nin these matters, I am well aware. That as a man I have been\noutrageously foolish in lending my name to Mr. Sowerby, I also know\nwell enough: it is perhaps as well that I should be told of this\nsomewhat rudely; but I certainly did not expect the lesson to come\nfrom you.\"\n\n\"Well, there has been mischief enough. The question is, what we had\nbetter now both do?\"\n\n\"You have said what you mean to do. You will put the affair into the\nhands of your lawyer.\"\n\n\"Not with any object of exposing you.\"\n\n\"Exposing me, Lord Lufton! Why, one would think that I had had the\nhandling of your money.\"\n\n\"You will misunderstand me. I think no such thing. But do you not\nknow yourself that if legal steps be taken in this wretched affair,\nyour arrangements with Sowerby will be brought to light?\"\n\n\"My arrangements with Sowerby will consist in paying or having to\npay, on his account, a large sum of money, for which I have never had\nand shall never have any consideration whatever.\"\n\n\"And what will be said about this stall at Barchester?\"\n\n\"After the charge which you brought against me just now, I shall\ndecline to accept it.\"\n\nAt this moment three or four other gentlemen entered the room, and\nthe conversation between our two friends was stopped. They still\nremained standing near the fire, but for a few minutes neither of\nthem said anything. Robarts was waiting till Lord Lufton should go\naway, and Lord Lufton had not yet said that which he had come to say.\nAt last he spoke again, almost in a whisper: \"I think it will be best\nto ask Sowerby to come to my rooms to-morrow, and I think also that\nyou should meet him there.\"\n\n\"I do not see any necessity for my presence,\" said Robarts. \"It seems\nprobable that I shall suffer enough for meddling with your affairs,\nand I will do so no more.\"\n\n\"Of course I cannot make you come; but I think it will be only just\nto Sowerby, and it will be a favour to me.\"\n\nRobarts again walked up and down the room for half-a-dozen times,\ntrying to resolve what it would most become him to do in the present\nemergency. If his name were dragged before the courts,--if he\nshould be shown up in the public papers as having been engaged in\naccommodation bills, that would certainly be ruinous to him. He had\nalready learned from Lord Lufton's innuendoes what he might expect to\nhear as the public version of his share in these transactions! And\nthen his wife,--how would she bear such exposure?\n\n\"I will meet Mr. Sowerby at your rooms to-morrow, on one condition,\"\nhe at last said.\n\n\"And what is that?\"\n\n\"That I receive your positive assurance that I am not suspected\nby you of having had any pecuniary interest whatever in any money\nmatters with Mr. Sowerby, either as concerns your affairs or those of\nanybody else.\"\n\n\"I have never suspected you of any such thing. But I have thought\nthat you were compromised with him.\"\n\n\"And so I am--I am liable for these bills. But you ought to have\nknown, and do know, that I have never received a shilling on account\nof such liability. I have endeavoured to oblige a man whom I regarded\nfirst as your friend, and then as my own; and this has been the\nresult.\"\n\nLord Lufton did at last give him the assurance that he desired,\nas they sat with their heads together over one of the coffee-room\ntables; and then Robarts promised that he would postpone his return\nto Framley till the Saturday, so that he might meet Sowerby at Lord\nLufton's chambers in the Albany on the following afternoon. As soon\nas this was arranged, Lord Lufton took his leave and went his way.\n\nAfter that poor Mark had a very uneasy night of it. It was clear\nenough that Lord Lufton had thought, if he did not still think, that\nthe stall at Barchester was to be given as pecuniary recompense in\nreturn for certain money accommodation to be afforded by the nominee\nto the dispenser of this patronage. Nothing on earth could be worse\nthan this. In the first place it would be simony; and then it would\nbe simony beyond all description mean and simoniacal. The very\nthought of it filled Mark's soul with horror and dismay. It might\nbe that Lord Lufton's suspicions were now at rest; but others would\nthink the same thing, and their suspicions it would be impossible to\nallay; those others would consist of the outer world, which is always\nso eager to gloat over the detected vice of a clergyman.\n\nAnd then that wretched horse which he had purchased, and the purchase\nof which should have prohibited him from saying that nothing of value\nhad accrued to him in these transactions with Mr. Sowerby! what was\nhe to do about that? And then of late he had been spending, and had\ncontinued to spend, more money than he could well afford. This very\njourney of his up to London would be most imprudent, if it should\nbecome necessary for him to give up all hope of holding the prebend.\nAs to that he had made up his mind; but then again he unmade it, as\nmen always do in such troubles. That line of conduct which he had\nlaid down for himself in the first moments of his indignation against\nLord Lufton, by adopting which he would have to encounter poverty,\nand ridicule, and discomfort, the annihilation of his high hopes,\nand the ruin of his ambition--that, he said to himself over and over\nagain, would now be the best for him. But it is so hard for us to\ngive up our high hopes, and willingly encounter poverty, ridicule,\nand discomfort!\n\nOn the following morning, however, he boldly walked down to the\nPetty Bag office, determined to let Harold Smith know that he was no\nlonger desirous of the Barchester stall. He found his brother there,\nstill writing artistic notes to anxious peeresses on the subject of\nBuggins' non-vacant situation; but the great man of the place, the\nLord Petty Bag himself, was not there. He might probably look in when\nthe House was beginning to sit, perhaps at four or a little after;\nbut he certainly would not be at the office in the morning. The\nfunctions of the Lord Petty Bag he was no doubt performing elsewhere.\nPerhaps he had carried his work home with him--a practice which the\nworld should know is not uncommon with civil servants of exceeding\nzeal.\n\nMark did think of opening his heart to his brother, and of leaving\nhis message with him. But his courage failed him, or perhaps it might\nbe more correct to say that his prudence prevented him. It would be\nbetter for him, he thought, to tell his wife before he told any one\nelse. So he merely chatted with his brother for half an hour and then\nleft him.\n\nThe day was very tedious till the hour came at which he was to attend\nat Lord Lufton's rooms; but at last it did come, and just as the\nclock struck, he turned out of Piccadilly into the Albany. As he was\ngoing across the court before he entered the building, he was greeted\nby a voice just behind him.\n\n\"As punctual as the big clock on Barchester tower,\" said Mr. Sowerby.\n\"See what it is to have a summons from a great man, Mr. Prebendary.\"\n\nHe turned round and extended his hand mechanically to Mr. Sowerby,\nand as he looked at him he thought he had never before seen him\nso pleasant in appearance, so free from care, and so joyous in\ndemeanour.\n\n\"You have heard from Lord Lufton,\" said Mark in a voice that was\ncertainly very lugubrious.\n\n\"Heard from him! oh, yes, of course I have heard from him. I'll tell\nyou what it is, Mark,\" and he now spoke almost in a whisper as they\nwalked together along the Albany passage, \"Lufton is a child in money\nmatters--a perfect child. The dearest, finest fellow in the world,\nyou know; but a very baby in money matters.\" And then they entered\nhis lordship's rooms.\n\nLord Lufton's countenance also was lugubrious enough, but this did\nnot in the least abash Sowerby, who walked quickly up to the young\nlord with his gait perfectly self-possessed and his face radiant with\nsatisfaction.\n\n\"Well, Lufton, how are you?\" said he. \"It seems that my worthy friend\nTozer has been giving you some trouble?\"\n\nThen Lord Lufton with a face by no means radiant with satisfaction\nagain began the story of Tozer's fraudulent demand upon him. Sowerby\ndid not interrupt him, but listened patiently to the end;--quite\npatiently, although Lord Lufton, as he made himself more and more\nangry by the history of his own wrongs, did not hesitate to pronounce\ncertain threats against Mr. Sowerby, as he had pronounced them before\nagainst Mark Robarts. He would not, he said, pay a shilling, except\nthrough his lawyer; and he would instruct his lawyer, that before he\npaid anything, the whole matter should be exposed openly in court. He\ndid not care, he said, what might be the effect on himself or any one\nelse. He was determined that the whole case should go to a jury.\n\n\"To grand jury, and special jury, and common jury, and Old Jewry, if\nyou like,\" said Sowerby. \"The truth is, Lufton, you lost some money,\nand as there was some delay in paying it, you have been harassed.\"\n\n\"I have paid more than I lost three times over,\" said Lord Lufton,\nstamping his foot.\n\n\"I will not go into that question now. It was settled, as I thought,\nsome time ago by persons to whom you yourself referred it. But will\nyou tell me this: Why on earth should Robarts be troubled in this\nmatter? What has he done?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know. He arranged the matter with you.\"\n\n\"No such thing. He was kind enough to carry a message from you to me,\nand to convey back a return message from me to you. That has been his\npart in it.\"\n\n\"You don't suppose that I want to implicate him: do you?\"\n\n\"I don't think you want to implicate any one, but you are hot-headed\nand difficult to deal with, and very irrational into the bargain.\nAnd, what is worse, I must say you are a little suspicious. In all\nthis matter I have harassed myself greatly to oblige you, and in\nreturn I have got more kicks than halfpence.\"\n\n\"Did not you give this bill to Tozer--the bill which he now holds?\"\n\n\"In the first place he does not hold it; and in the next place I did\nnot give it to him. These things pass through scores of hands before\nthey reach the man who makes the application for payment.\"\n\n\"And who came to me the other day?\"\n\n\"That, I take it, was Tom Tozer, a brother of our Tozer's.\"\n\n\"Then he holds the bill, for I saw it with him.\"\n\n\"Wait a moment; that is very likely. I sent you word that you would\nhave to pay for taking it up. Of course they don't abandon those sort\nof things without some consideration.\"\n\n\"Ten pounds, you said,\" observed Mark.\n\n\"Ten or twenty; some such sum as that. But you were hardly so soft\nas to suppose that the man would ask for such a sum. Of course he\nwould demand the full payment. There is the bill, Lord Lufton,\" and\nSowerby, producing a document, handed it across the table to his\nlordship. \"I gave five-and-twenty pounds for it this morning.\"\n\nLord Lufton took the paper and looked at it. \"Yes,\" said he, \"that's\nthe bill. What am I to do with it now?\"\n\n\"Put it with the family archives,\" said Sowerby,--\"or behind the\nfire, just which you please.\"\n\n\"And is this the last of them? Can no other be brought up?\"\n\n\"You know better than I do what paper you may have put your hand to.\nI know of no other. At the last renewal that was the only outstanding\nbill of which I was aware.\"\n\n\"And you have paid five-and-twenty pounds for it?\"\n\n\"I have. Only that you have been in such a tantrum about it, and\nwould have made such a noise this afternoon if I had not brought it,\nI might have had it for fifteen or twenty. In three or four days they\nwould have taken fifteen.\"\n\n\"The odd ten pounds does not signify, and I'll pay you the\ntwenty-five, of course,\" said Lord Lufton, who now began to feel a\nlittle ashamed of himself.\n\n\"You may do as you please about that.\"\n\n\"Oh! it's my affair, as a matter of course. Any amount of that kind I\ndon't mind,\" and he sat down to fill in a cheque for the money.\n\n\"Well, now, Lufton, let me say a few words to you,\" said Sowerby,\nstanding with his back against the fireplace, and playing with a\nsmall cane which he held in his hand. \"For heaven's sake try and be a\nlittle more charitable to those around you. When you become fidgety\nabout anything, you indulge in language which the world won't stand,\nthough men who know you as well as Robarts and I may consent to put\nup with it. You have accused me, since I have been here, of all\nmanner of iniquity--\"\n\n\"Now, Sowerby--\"\n\n\"My dear fellow, let me have my say out. You have accused me, I say,\nand I believe that you have accused him. But it has never occurred to\nyou, I daresay, to accuse yourself.\"\n\n\"Indeed it has.\"\n\n\"Of course you have been wrong in having to do with such men as\nTozer. I have also been very wrong. It wants no great moral authority\nto tell us that. Pattern gentlemen don't have dealings with Tozer,\nand very much the better they are for not having them. But a man\nshould have back enough to bear the weight which he himself puts on\nit. Keep away from Tozer, if you can, for the future; but if you do\ndeal with him, for heaven's sake keep your temper.\"\n\n\"That's all very fine, Sowerby; but you know as well as I do--\"\n\n\"I know this,\" said the devil, quoting Scripture, as he folded up the\ncheck for twenty-five pounds, and put it in his pocket, \"that when a\nman sows tares, he won't reap wheat, and it's no use to expect it. I\nam tough in these matters, and can bear a great deal--that is, if I\nbe not pushed too far,\" and he looked full into Lord Lufton's face as\nhe spoke; \"but I think you have been very hard upon Robarts.\"\n\n\"Never mind me, Sowerby; Lord Lufton and I are very old friends.\"\n\n\"And may therefore take a liberty with each other. Very well. And\nnow I've done my sermon. My dear dignitary, allow me to congratulate\nyou. I hear from Fothergill that that little affair of yours has been\ndefinitely settled.\"\n\nMark's face again became clouded. \"I rather think,\" said he, \"that I\nshall decline the presentation.\"\n\n\"Decline it!\" said Sowerby, who, having used his utmost efforts\nto obtain it, would have been more absolutely offended by such\nvacillation on the vicar's part than by any personal abuse which\neither he or Lord Lufton could heap upon him.\n\n\"I think I shall,\" said Mark.\n\n\"And why?\"\n\nMark looked up at Lord Lufton, and then remained silent for a moment.\n\n\"There can be no occasion for such a sacrifice under the present\ncircumstances,\" said his lordship.\n\n\"And under what circumstances could there be occasion for it?\" asked\nSowerby. \"The Duke of Omnium has used some little influence to get\nthe place for you as a parish clergyman belonging to his county, and\nI should think it monstrous if you were now to reject it.\"\n\nAnd then Robarts openly stated the whole of his reasons, explaining\nexactly what Lord Lufton had said with reference to the bill\ntransactions, and to the allegation which would be made as to the\nstall having been given in payment for the accommodation.\n\n\"Upon my word that's too bad,\" said Sowerby.\n\n\"Now, Sowerby, I won't be lectured,\" said Lord Lufton.\n\n\"I have done my lecture,\" said he, aware, perhaps, that it would\nnot do for him to push his friend too far, \"and I shall not give a\nsecond. But, Robarts, let me tell you this: as far as I know, Harold\nSmith has had little or nothing to do with the appointment. The duke\nhas told the Prime Minister that he was very anxious that a parish\nclergyman from the county should go into the chapter, and then, at\nLord Brock's request, he named you. If under those circumstances you\ntalk of giving it up, I shall believe you to be insane. As for the\nbill which you accepted for me, you need have no uneasiness about it.\nThe money will be ready; but of course, when that time comes, you\nwill let me have the hundred and thirty for--\"\n\nAnd then Mr. Sowerby took his leave, having certainly made himself\nmaster of the occasion. If a man of fifty have his wits about him,\nand be not too prosy, he can generally make himself master of the\noccasion, when his companions are under thirty.\n\nRobarts did not stay at the Albany long after him, but took his\nleave, having received some assurances of Lord Lufton's regret for\nwhat had passed and many promises of his friendship for the future.\nIndeed Lord Lufton was a little ashamed of himself. \"And as for\nthe prebend, after what has passed, of course you must accept it.\"\nNevertheless his lordship had not omitted to notice Mr. Sowerby's\nhint about the horse and the hundred and thirty pounds.\n\nRobarts, as he walked back to his hotel, thought that he certainly\nwould accept the Barchester promotion, and was very glad that he had\nsaid nothing on the subject to his brother. On the whole his spirits\nwere much raised. That assurance of Sowerby's about the bill was very\ncomforting to him; and strange to say, he absolutely believed it. In\ntruth Sowerby had been so completely the winning horse at the late\nmeeting, that both Lord Lufton and Robarts were inclined to believe\nalmost anything he said;--which was not always the case with either\nof them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\nHAROLD SMITH IN THE CABINET.\n\n\nFor a few days the whole Harold Smith party held their heads very\nhigh. It was not only that their man had been made a cabinet\nminister; but a rumour had got abroad that Lord Brock, in selecting\nhim, had amazingly strengthened his party, and done much to cure the\nwounds which his own arrogance and lack of judgment had inflicted\non the body politic of his government. So said the Harold-Smithians,\nmuch elated. And when we consider what Harold had himself achieved,\nwe need not be surprised that he himself was somewhat elated also.\n\nIt must be a proud day for any man when he first walks into a\ncabinet. But when a humble-minded man thinks of such a phase of life,\nhis mind becomes lost in wondering what a cabinet is. Are they gods\nthat attend there or men? Do they sit on chairs, or hang about on\nclouds? When they speak, is the music of the spheres audible in their\nOlympian mansion, making heaven drowsy with its harmony? In what way\ndo they congregate? In what order do they address each other? Are the\nvoices of all the deities free and equal? Is plodding Themis from\nthe Home Department, or Ceres from the Colonies, heard with as rapt\nattention as powerful Pallas of the Foreign Office, the goddess that\nis never seen without her lance and helmet? Does our Whitehall Mars\nmake eyes there at bright young Venus of the Privy Seal, disgusting\nthat quaint tinkering Vulcan, who is blowing his bellows at our\nExchequer, not altogether unsuccessfully? Old Saturn of the Woolsack\nsits there mute, we will say, a relic of other days, as seated in\nthis divan. The hall in which he rules is now elsewhere. Is our\nMercury of the Post Office ever ready to fly nimbly from globe to\nglobe, as great Jove may order him, while Neptune, unaccustomed to\nthe waves, offers needful assistance to the Apollo of the India\nBoard? How Juno sits apart, glum and huffy, uncared for, Council\nPresident though she be, great in name, but despised among gods--that\nwe can guess. If Bacchus and Cupid share Trade and the Board of Works\nbetween them, the fitness of things will have been as fully consulted\nas is usual. And modest Diana of the Petty Bag, latest summoned to\nthese banquets of ambrosia,--does she not cling retiring near the\ndoors, hardly able as yet to make her low voice heard among her\nbrother deities? But Jove, great Jove--old Jove, the King of Olympus,\nhero among gods and men, how does he carry himself in these councils\nsummoned by his voice? Does he lie there at his ease, with his purple\ncloak cut from the firmament around his shoulders? Is his thunderbolt\never at his hand to reduce a recreant god to order? Can he proclaim\nsilence in that immortal hall? Is it not there, as elsewhere, in all\nplaces, and among all nations, that a king of gods and a king of men\nis and will be king, rules and will rule, over those who are smaller\nthan himself?\n\nHarold Smith, when he was summoned to the august hall of divine\ncouncils, did feel himself to be a proud man; but we may perhaps\nconclude that at the first meeting or two he did not attempt to take\na very leading part. Some of my readers may have sat at vestries, and\nwill remember how mild, and for the most part, mute, is a new-comer\nat their board. He agrees generally, with abated enthusiasm; but\nshould he differ, he apologizes for the liberty. But anon, when the\nvoices of his colleagues have become habitual in his ears--when the\nstrangeness of the room is gone, and the table before him is known\nand trusted--he throws off his awe and dismay, and electrifies his\nbrotherhood by the vehemence of his declamation and the violence of\nhis thumping. So let us suppose it will be with Harold Smith, perhaps\nin the second or third season of his cabinet practice. Alas! alas!\nthat such pleasures should be so fleeting!\n\nAnd then, too, there came upon him a blow which somewhat modified his\ntriumph--a cruel, dastard blow, from a hand which should have been\nfriendly to him, from one to whom he had fondly looked to buoy him\nup in the great course that was before him. It had been said by his\nfriends that in obtaining Harold Smith's services the Prime Minister\nhad infused new young healthy blood into his body. Harold himself had\nliked the phrase, and had seen at a glance how it might have been\nmade to tell by some friendly Supplehouse or the like. But why should\na Supplehouse out of Elysium be friendly to a Harold Smith within it?\nMen lapped in Elysium, steeped to the neck in bliss, must expect to\nsee their friends fall off from them. Human nature cannot stand it.\nIf I want to get anything from my old friend Jones, I like to see him\nshoved up into a high place. But if Jones, even in his high place,\ncan do nothing for me, then his exaltation above my head is an insult\nand an injury. Who ever believes his own dear intimate companion to\nbe fit for the highest promotion? Mr. Supplehouse had known Mr. Smith\ntoo closely to think much of his young blood.\n\nConsequently, there appeared an article in the _Jupiter_, which was\nby no means complimentary to the ministry in general. It harped a\ngood deal on the young blood view of the question, and seemed to\ninsinuate that Harold Smith was not much better than diluted water.\n\"The Prime Minister,\" the article said, \"having lately recruited\nhis impaired vigour by a new infusion of aristocratic influence of\nthe highest moral tone, had again added to himself another tower of\nstrength chosen from among the people. What might he not hope, now\nthat he possessed the services of Lord Brittleback and Mr. Harold\nSmith! Renovated in a Medea's caldron of such potency, all his effete\nlimbs--and it must be acknowledged that some of them had become very\neffete--would come forth young and round and robust. A new energy\nwould diffuse itself through every department; India would be saved\nand quieted; the ambition of France would be tamed; even-handed\nreform would remodel our courts of law and parliamentary elections;\nand Utopia would be realized. Such, it seems, is the result expected\nin the ministry from Mr. Harold Smith's young blood!\"\n\nThis was cruel enough, but even this was hardly so cruel as the words\nwith which the article ended. By that time irony had been dropped,\nand the writer spoke out earnestly his opinion upon the matter. \"We\nbeg to assure Lord Brock,\" said the article, \"that such alliances as\nthese will not save him from the speedy fall with which his arrogance\nand want of judgment threaten to overwhelm it. As regards himself we\nshall be sorry to hear of his resignation. He is in many respects the\nbest statesman that we possess for the emergencies of the present\nperiod. But if he be so ill-judged as to rest on such men as Mr.\nHarold Smith and Lord Brittleback for his assistants in the work\nwhich is before him, he must not expect that the country will support\nhim. Mr. Harold Smith is not made of the stuff from which cabinet\nministers should be formed.\"\n\nMr. Harold Smith, as he read this, seated at his breakfast-table,\nrecognized, or said that he recognized, the hand of Mr. Supplehouse\nin every touch. That phrase about the effete limbs was Supplehouse\nall over, as was also the realization of Utopia. \"When he wants to\nbe witty, he always talks about Utopia,\" said Mr. Harold Smith--to\nhimself: for Mrs. Harold was not usually present in the flesh at\nthese matutinal meals.\n\nAnd then he went down to his office, and saw in the glance of every\nman that he met an announcement that that article in the _Jupiter_\nhad been read. His private secretary tittered in evident allusion to\nthe article, and the way in which Buggins took his coat made it clear\nthat it was well known in the messengers' lobby. \"He won't have to\nfill up my vacancy when I go,\" Buggins was saying to himself. And\nthen in the course of the morning came the cabinet council, the\nsecond that he had attended, and he read in the countenance of every\ngod and goddess there assembled that their chief was thought to have\nmade another mistake. If Mr. Supplehouse could have been induced to\nwrite in another strain, then indeed that new blood might have been\nfelt to have been efficacious.\n\nAll this was a great drawback to his happiness, but still it could\nnot rob him of the fact of his position. Lord Brock could not ask him\nto resign because the _Jupiter_ had written against him; nor was Lord\nBrock the man to desert a new colleague for such a reason. So Harold\nSmith girded his loins, and went about the duties of the Petty Bag\nwith new zeal. \"Upon my word, the _Jupiter_ is right,\" said young\nRobarts to himself, as he finished his fourth dozen of private notes\nexplanatory of everything in and about the Petty Bag Office. Harold\nSmith required that his private secretary's notes should be so\nterribly precise.\n\nBut nevertheless, in spite of his drawbacks, Harold Smith was happy\nin his new honours, and Mrs. Harold Smith enjoyed them also. She\ncertainly, among her acquaintance, did quiz the new cabinet minister\nnot a little, and it may be a question whether she was not as hard\nupon him as the writer in the _Jupiter_. She whispered a great deal\nto Miss Dunstable about new blood, and talked of going down to\nWestminster Bridge to see whether the Thames were really on fire. But\nthough she laughed, she triumphed, and though she flattered herself\nthat she bore her honours without any outward sign, the world knew\nthat she was triumphing, and ridiculed her elation.\n\nAbout this time she also gave a party--not a pure-minded\nconversazione like Mrs. Proudie, but a downright wicked worldly\ndance, at which there were fiddles, ices, and champagne sufficient to\nrun away with the first quarter's salary accruing to Harold from the\nPetty Bag Office. To us this ball is chiefly memorable from the fact\nthat Lady Lufton was among the guests. Immediately on her arrival in\ntown she received cards from Mrs. H. Smith for herself and Griselda,\nand was about to send back a reply at once declining the honour.\nWhat had she to do at the house of Mr. Sowerby's sister? But it\nso happened that at that moment her son was with her, and as he\nexpressed a wish that she should go, she yielded. Had there been\nnothing in his tone of persuasion more than ordinary,--had it merely\nhad reference to herself,--she would have smiled on him for his kind\nsolicitude, have made out some occasion for kissing his forehead as\nshe thanked him, and would still have declined. But he had reminded\nher both of himself and Griselda. \"You might as well go, mother, for\nthe sake of meeting me,\" he said; \"Mrs. Harold caught me the other\nday, and would not liberate me till I had given her a promise.\"\n\n\"That is an attraction certainly,\" said Lady Lufton. \"I do like going\nto a house when I know that you will be there.\"\n\n\"And now that Miss Grantly is with you--you owe it to her to do the\nbest you can for her.\"\n\n\"I certainly do, Ludovic; and I have to thank you for reminding me\nof my duty so gallantly.\" And so she said that she would go to Mrs.\nHarold Smith's. Poor lady! She gave much more weight to those few\nwords about Miss Grantly than they deserved. It rejoiced her heart\nto think that her son was anxious to meet Griselda--that he should\nperpetrate this little _ruse_ in order to gain his wish. But he had\nspoken out of the mere emptiness of his mind, without thought of what\nhe was saying, excepting that he wished to please his mother.\n\nBut nevertheless he went to Mrs. Harold Smith's, and when there he\ndid dance more than once with Griselda Grantly--to the manifest\ndiscomfiture of Lord Dumbello. He came in late, and at the moment\nLord Dumbello was moving slowly up the room, with Griselda on his\narm, while Lady Lufton was sitting near looking on with unhappy eyes.\nAnd then Griselda sat down, and Lord Dumbello stood mute at her\nelbow.\n\n\"Ludovic,\" whispered his mother, \"Griselda is absolutely bored by\nthat man, who follows her like a ghost. Do go and rescue her.\"\n\nHe did go and rescue her, and afterwards danced with her for the\nbest part of an hour consecutively. He knew that the world gave Lord\nDumbello the credit of admiring the young lady, and was quite alive\nto the pleasure of filling his brother nobleman's heart with jealousy\nand anger. Moreover, Griselda was in his eyes very beautiful, and had\nshe been one whit more animated, or had his mother's tactics been but\na thought better concealed, Griselda might have been asked that night\nto share the vacant throne at Lufton, in spite of all that had been\nsaid and sworn in the drawing-room of Framley Parsonage.\n\nIt must be remembered that our gallant, gay Lothario had passed some\nconsiderable number of days with Miss Grantly in his mother's house,\nand the danger of such contiguity must be remembered also. Lord\nLufton was by no means a man capable of seeing beauty unmoved or of\nspending hours with a young lady without some approach to tenderness.\nHad there been no such approach, it is probable that Lady Lufton\nwould not have pursued the matter. But, according to her ideas on\nsuch subjects, her son Ludovic had on some occasions shown quite\nsufficient partiality for Miss Grantly to justify her in her hopes,\nand to lead her to think that nothing but opportunity was wanted.\nNow, at this ball of Mrs. Smith's, he did, for a while, seem to be\ntaking advantage of such opportunity, and his mother's heart was\nglad. If things should turn out well on this evening she would\nforgive Mrs. Harold Smith all her sins.\n\nAnd for a while it looked as though things would turn out well. Not\nthat it must be supposed that Lord Lufton had come there with any\nintention of making love to Griselda, or that he ever had any fixed\nthought that he was doing so. Young men in such matters are so often\nwithout any fixed thoughts! They are such absolute moths. They amuse\nthemselves with the light of the beautiful candle, fluttering about,\non and off, in and out of the flame with dazzled eyes, till in a rash\nmoment they rush in too near the wick, and then fall with singed\nwings and crippled legs, burnt up and reduced to tinder by the\nconsuming fire of matrimony. Happy marriages, men say, are made in\nheaven, and I believe it. Most marriages are fairly happy, in spite\nof Sir Cresswell Cresswell; and yet how little care is taken on earth\ntowards such a result!\n\n\"I hope my mother is using you well?\" said Lord Lufton to Griselda,\nas they were standing together in a doorway between the dances.\n\n\"Oh, yes: she is very kind.\"\n\n\"You have been rash to trust yourself in the hands of so very staid\nand demure a person. And, indeed, you owe your presence here at Mrs.\nHarold Smith's first cabinet ball altogether to me. I don't know\nwhether you are aware of that.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes: Lady Lufton told me.\"\n\n\"And are you grateful or otherwise? Have I done you an injury or a\nbenefit? Which do you find best, sitting with a novel in the corner\nof a sofa in Bruton Street, or pretending to dance polkas here with\nLord Dumbello?\"\n\n\"I don't know what you mean. I haven't stood up with Lord Dumbello\nall the evening. We were going to dance a quadrille, but we didn't.\"\n\n\"Exactly; just what I say;--pretending to do it. Even that's a good\ndeal for Lord Dumbello; isn't it?\" And then Lord Lufton, not being a\npretender himself, put his arm round her waist, and away they went up\nand down the room, and across and about, with an energy which showed\nthat what Griselda lacked in her tongue she made up with her feet.\nLord Dumbello, in the meantime, stood by, observant, thinking to\nhimself that Lord Lufton was a glib-tongued, empty-headed ass, and\nreflecting that if his rival were to break the tendons of his leg in\none of those rapid evolutions, or suddenly come by any other dreadful\nmisfortune, such as the loss of all his property, absolute blindness,\nor chronic lumbago, it would only serve him right. And in that frame\nof mind he went to bed, in spite of the prayer which no doubt he said\nas to his forgiveness of other people's trespasses.\n\nAnd then, when they were again standing, Lord Lufton, in the little\nintervals between his violent gasps for fresh breath, asked Griselda\nif she liked London. \"Pretty well,\" said Griselda, gasping also a\nlittle herself.\n\n\"I am afraid--you were very dull--down at Framley.\"\n\n\"Oh, no;--I liked it--particularly.\"\n\n\"It was a great bore when you went--away, I know. There wasn't a\nsoul--about the house worth speaking to.\" And they remained silent\nfor a minute till their lungs had become quiescent.\n\n\"Not a soul,\" he continued--not of falsehood prepense, for he was not\nin fact thinking of what he was saying. It did not occur to him at\nthe moment that he had truly found Griselda's going a great relief,\nand that he had been able to do more in the way of conversation with\nLucy Robarts in one hour than with Miss Grantly during a month of\nintercourse in the same house. But, nevertheless, we should not be\nhard upon him. All is fair in love and war; and if this was not love,\nit was the usual thing that stands as a counterpart for it.\n\n\"Not a soul,\" said Lord Lufton. \"I was very nearly hanging myself in\nthe park next morning;--only it rained.\"\n\n\"What nonsense! You had your mother to talk to.\"\n\n\"Oh, my mother,--yes; and you may tell me too, if you please, that\nCaptain Culpepper was there. I do love my mother dearly; but do you\nthink that she could make up for your absence?\" And his voice was\nvery tender, and so were his eyes.\n\n\"And Miss Robarts; I thought you admired her very much?\"\n\n\"What, Lucy Robarts?\" said Lord Lufton, feeling that Lucy's name\nwas more than he at present knew how to manage. Indeed that name\ndestroyed all the life there was in that little flirtation. \"I do\nlike Lucy Robarts, certainly. She is very clever; but it so happened\nthat I saw little or nothing of her after you were gone.\"\n\nTo this Griselda made no answer, but drew herself up, and looked\nas cold as Diana when she froze Orion in the cave. Nor could she\nbe got to give more than monosyllabic answers to the three or four\nsucceeding attempts at conversation which Lord Lufton made. And then\nthey danced again, but Griselda's steps were by no means so lively as\nbefore.\n\nWhat took place between them on that occasion was very little more\nthan what has been here related. There may have been an ice or a\nglass of lemonade into the bargain, and perhaps the faintest possible\nattempt at hand-pressing. But if so, it was all on one side. To such\novertures as that Griselda Grantly was as cold as any Diana.\n\nBut little as all this was, it was sufficient to fill Lady Lufton's\nmind and heart. No mother with six daughters was ever more anxious\nto get them off her hands, than Lady Lufton was to see her son\nmarried,--married, that is, to some girl of the right sort. And now\nit really did seem as though he were actually going to comply with\nher wishes. She had watched him during the whole evening, painfully\nendeavouring not to be observed in doing so. She had seen Lord\nDumbello's failure and wrath, and she had seen her son's victory and\npride. Could it be the case that he had already said something, which\nwas still allowed to be indecisive only through Griselda's coldness?\nMight it not be the case, that by some judicious aid on her part,\nthat indecision might be turned into certainty, and that coldness\ninto warmth? But then any such interference requires so delicate a\ntouch,--as Lady Lufton was well aware.\n\n\"Have you had a pleasant evening?\" Lady Lufton said, when she and\nGriselda were seated together with their feet on the fender of her\nladyship's dressing-room. Lady Lufton had especially invited her\nguest into this, her most private sanctum, to which as a rule none\nhad admittance but her daughter, and sometimes Fanny Robarts. But\nto what sanctum might not such a daughter-in-law as Griselda have\nadmittance?\n\n\"Oh, yes--very,\" said Griselda.\n\n\"It seemed to me that you bestowed most of your smiles upon Ludovic.\"\nAnd Lady Lufton put on a look of good pleasure that such should have\nbeen the case.\n\n\"Oh! I don't know,\" said Griselda: \"I did dance with him two or three\ntimes.\"\n\n\"Not once too often to please me, my dear. I like to see Ludovic\ndancing with my friends.\"\n\n\"I am sure I am very much obliged to you, Lady Lufton.\"\n\n\"Not at all, my dear. I don't know where he could get so nice a\npartner.\" And then she paused a moment, not feeling how far she might\ngo. In the meantime Griselda sat still, staring at the hot coals.\n\"Indeed, I know that he admires you very much,\" continued Lady\nLufton.\n\n\"Oh! no, I am sure he doesn't,\" said Griselda; and then there was\nanother pause.\n\n\"I can only say this,\" said Lady Lufton, \"that if he does do so--and\nI believe he does--it would give me very great pleasure. For you\nknow, my dear, that I am very fond of you myself.\"\n\n\"Oh! thank you,\" said Griselda, and stared at the coals more\nperseveringly than before.\n\n\"He is a young man of a most excellent disposition--though he is my\nown son, I will say that--and if there should be anything between you\nand him--\"\n\n\"There isn't, indeed, Lady Lufton.\"\n\n\"But if there ever should be, I should be delighted to think that\nLudovic had made so good a choice.\"\n\n\"But there will never be anything of the sort, I'm sure, Lady Lufton.\nHe is not thinking of such a thing in the least.\"\n\n\"Well, perhaps he may, some day. And now, good-night, my dear.\"\n\n\"Good-night, Lady Lufton.\" And Griselda kissed her with the utmost\ncomposure, and betook herself to her own bedroom. Before she retired\nto sleep she looked carefully to her different articles of dress,\ndiscovering what amount of damage the evening's wear and tear might\nhave inflicted.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\nWHY PUCK, THE PONY, WAS BEATEN.\n\n\nMark Robarts returned home the day after the scene at the Albany,\nconsiderably relieved in spirit. He now felt that he might accept\nthe stall without discredit to himself as a clergyman in doing so.\nIndeed, after what Mr. Sowerby had said, and after Lord Lufton's\nassent to it, it would have been madness, he considered, to decline\nit. And then, too, Mr. Sowerby's promise about the bills was very\ncomfortable to him. After all, might it not be possible that he might\nget rid of all these troubles with no other drawback than that of\nhaving to pay \u00c2\u00a3130 for a horse that was well worth the money?\n\nOn the day after his return he received proper authentic tidings of\nhis presentation to the prebend. He was, in fact, already prebendary,\nor would be as soon as the dean and chapter had gone through the form\nof instituting him in his stall. The income was already his own; and\nthe house also would be given up to him in a week's time--a part of\nthe arrangement with which he would most willingly have dispensed had\nit been at all possible to do so. His wife congratulated him nicely,\nwith open affection, and apparent satisfaction at the arrangement.\nThe enjoyment of one's own happiness at such windfalls depends so\nmuch on the free and freely expressed enjoyment of others! Lady\nLufton's congratulations had nearly made him throw up the whole\nthing; but his wife's smiles re-encouraged him; and Lucy's warm and\neager joy made him feel quite delighted with Mr. Sowerby and the Duke\nof Omnium. And then that splendid animal, Dandy, came home to the\nparsonage stables, much to the delight of the groom and gardener,\nand of the assistant stable boy who had been allowed to creep into\nthe establishment, unawares as it were, since \"master\" had taken so\nkeenly to hunting. But this satisfaction was not shared in the\ndrawing-room. The horse was seen on his first journey round to the\nstable gate, and questions were immediately asked. It was a horse,\nMark said, \"which he had bought from Mr. Sowerby some little time\nsince with the object of obliging him. He, Mark, intended to sell him\nagain, as soon as he could do so judiciously.\" This, as I have said\nabove, was not satisfactory. Neither of the two ladies at Framley\nParsonage knew much about horses, or of the manner in which one\ngentleman might think it proper to oblige another by purchasing the\nsuperfluities of his stable; but they did both feel that there were\nhorses enough in the parsonage stable without Dandy, and that the\npurchasing of a hunter with the view of immediately selling him\nagain, was, to say the least of it, an operation hardly congenial\nwith the usual tastes and pursuits of a clergyman.\n\n\"I hope you did not give very much money for him, Mark,\" said Fanny.\n\n\"Not more than I shall get again,\" said Mark; and Fanny saw from the\nform of his countenance that she had better not pursue the subject\nany further at that moment.\n\n\"I suppose I shall have to go into residence almost immediately,\"\nsaid Mark, recurring to the more agreeable subject of the stall.\n\n\"And shall we all have to go and live at Barchester at once?\" asked\nLucy.\n\n\"The house will not be furnished, will it, Mark?\" said his wife. \"I\ndon't know how we shall get on.\"\n\n\"Don't frighten yourselves. I shall take lodgings in Barchester.\"\n\n\"And we shall not see you all the time,\" said Mrs. Robarts with\ndismay. But the prebendary explained that he would be backwards and\nforwards at Framley every week, and that in all probability he would\nonly sleep at Barchester on the Saturdays and Sundays--and, perhaps,\nnot always then.\n\n\"It does not seem very hard work, that of a prebendary,\" said Lucy.\n\n\"But it is very dignified,\" said Fanny. \"Prebendaries are dignitaries\nof the Church--are they not, Mark?\"\n\n\"Decidedly,\" said he; \"and their wives also, by special canon law.\nThe worst of it is that both of them are obliged to wear wigs.\"\n\n\"Shall you have a hat, Mark, with curly things at the side, and\nstrings through to hold them up?\" asked Lucy.\n\n\"I fear that does not come within my perquisites.\"\n\n\"Nor a rosette? Then I shall never believe that you are a dignitary.\nDo you mean to say that you will wear a hat like a common\nparson--like Mr. Crawley, for instance?\"\n\n\"Well--I believe I may give a twist to the leaf; but I am by no means\nsure till I shall have consulted the dean in chapter.\"\n\nAnd thus at the parsonage they talked over the good things that were\ncoming to them, and endeavoured to forget the new horse, and the\nhunting boots that had been used so often during the last winter, and\nLady Lufton's altered countenance. It might be that the evils would\nvanish away, and the good things alone remain to them.\n\nIt was now the month of April, and the fields were beginning to look\ngreen, and the wind had got itself out of the east and was soft\nand genial, and the early spring flowers were showing their bright\ncolours in the parsonage garden, and all things were sweet and\npleasant. This was a period of the year that was usually dear to Mrs.\nRobarts. Her husband was always a better parson when the warm months\ncame than he had been during the winter. The distant county friends\nwhom she did not know and of whom she did not approve went away when\nthe spring came, leaving their houses innocent and empty. The parish\nduty was better attended to, and perhaps domestic duties also. At\nsuch period he was a pattern parson and a pattern husband, atoning to\nhis own conscience for past shortcomings by present zeal. And then,\nthough she had never acknowledged it to herself, the absence of her\ndear friend Lady Lufton was perhaps in itself not disagreeable. Mrs.\nRobarts did love Lady Lufton heartily; but it must be acknowledged of\nher ladyship, that, with all her good qualities, she was inclined to\nbe masterful. She liked to rule, and she made people feel that she\nliked it. Mrs. Robarts would never have confessed that she laboured\nunder a sense of thraldom; but perhaps she was mouse enough to enjoy\nthe temporary absence of her kind-hearted cat. When Lady Lufton was\naway Mrs. Robarts herself had more play in the parish.\n\nAnd Mark also was not unhappy, though he did not find it practicable\nimmediately to turn Dandy into money. Indeed, just at this moment,\nwhen he was a good deal over at Barchester, going through those deep\nmysteries and rigid ecclesiastical examinations which are necessary\nbefore a clergyman can become one of a chapter, Dandy was rather a\nthorn in his side. Those wretched bills were to come due early in\nMay, and before the end of April Sowerby wrote to him saying that he\nwas doing his utmost to provide for the evil day; but that if the\nprice of Dandy could be remitted to him _at once_, it would greatly\nfacilitate his object. Nothing could be more different than Mr.\nSowerby's tone about money at different times. When he wanted to\nraise the wind, everything was so important; haste and superhuman\nefforts, and men running to and fro with blank acceptances in their\nhands, could alone stave off the crack of doom; but at other times,\nwhen retaliatory applications were made to him, he could prove with\nthe easiest voice and most jaunty manner that everything was quite\nserene. Now, at this period, he was in that mood of superhuman\nefforts, and he called loudly for the hundred and thirty pounds for\nDandy. After what had passed, Mark could not bring himself to say\nthat he would pay nothing till the bills were safe; and therefore\nwith the assistance of Mr. Forrest of the Bank, he did remit the\nprice of Dandy to his friend Sowerby in London.\n\nAnd Lucy Robarts--we must now say a word of her. We have seen how, on\nthat occasion, when the world was at her feet, she had sent her noble\nsuitor away, not only dismissed, but so dismissed that he might be\ntaught never again to offer to her the sweet incense of his vows. She\nhad declared to him plainly that she did not love him and could not\nlove him, and had thus thrown away not only riches and honour and\nhigh station, but more than that--much worse than that--she had flung\naway from her the lover to whose love her warm heart clung. That her\nlove did cling to him, she knew even then, and owned more thoroughly\nas soon as he was gone. So much her pride had done for her, and that\nstrong resolve that Lady Lufton should not scowl on her and tell her\nthat she had entrapped her son.\n\nI know it will be said of Lord Lufton himself that, putting aside his\npeerage and broad acres, and handsome, sonsy face, he was not worth\na girl's care and love. That will be said because people think that\nheroes in books should be so much better than heroes got up for the\nworld's common wear and tear. I may as well confess that of absolute,\ntrue heroism there was only a moderate admixture in Lord Lufton's\ncomposition; but what would the world come to if none but absolute\ntrue heroes were to be thought worthy of women's love? What would the\nmen do? and what--oh! what would become of the women? Lucy Robarts\nin her heart did not give her dismissed lover credit for much more\nheroism than did truly appertain to him;--did not, perhaps, give\nhim full credit for a certain amount of heroism which did really\nappertain to him; but, nevertheless, she would have been very glad to\ntake him could she have done so without wounding her pride.\n\nThat girls should not marry for money we are all agreed. A lady who\ncan sell herself for a title or an estate, for an income or a set\nof family diamonds, treats herself as a farmer treats his sheep and\noxen--makes hardly more of herself, of her own inner self, in which\nare comprised a mind and soul, than the poor wretch of her own sex\nwho earns her bread in the lowest stage of degradation. But a title,\nand an estate, and an income, are matters which will weigh in the\nbalance with all Eve's daughters--as they do with all Adam's sons.\nPride of place, and the power of living well in front of the world's\neye, are dear to us all;--are, doubtless, intended to be dear. Only\nin acknowledging so much, let us remember that there are prices at\nwhich these good things may be too costly. Therefore, being desirous,\ntoo, of telling the truth in this matter, I must confess that Lucy\ndid speculate with some regret on what it would have been to be Lady\nLufton. To have been the wife of such a man, the owner of such a\nheart, the mistress of such a destiny--what more or what better could\nthe world have done for her? And now she had thrown all that aside\nbecause she would not endure that Lady Lufton should call her a\nscheming, artful girl! Actuated by that fear she had repulsed him\nwith a falsehood, though the matter was one on which it was so\nterribly expedient that she should tell the truth.\n\nAnd yet she was cheerful with her brother and sister-in-law. It\nwas when she was quite alone, at night in her own room, or in her\nsolitary walks, that a single silent tear would gather in the corner\nof her eye and gradually moisten her eyelids. \"She never told\nher love,\" nor did she allow concealment to \"feed on her damask\ncheek.\" In all her employments, in her ways about the house, and her\naccustomed quiet mirth, she was the same as ever. In this she showed\nthe peculiar strength which God had given her. But not the less did\nshe in truth mourn for her lost love and spoiled ambition.\n\n\"We are going to drive over to Hogglestock this morning,\" Fanny said\none day at breakfast. \"I suppose, Mark, you won't go with us?\"\n\n\"Well, no; I think not. The pony-carriage is wretched for three.\"\n\n\"Oh, as for that, I should have thought the new horse might have been\nable to carry you as far as that. I heard you say you wanted to see\nMr. Crawley.\"\n\n\"So I do; and the new horse, as you call him, shall carry me there\nto-morrow. Will you say that I'll be over about twelve o'clock?\"\n\n\"You had better say earlier, as he is always out about the parish.\"\n\n\"Very well, say eleven. It is parish business about which I am going,\nso it need not irk his conscience to stay in for me.\"\n\n\"Well, Lucy, we must drive ourselves, that's all. You shall be\ncharioteer going, and then we'll change coming back.\" To all which\nLucy agreed, and as soon as their work in the school was over they\nstarted.\n\nNot a word had been spoken between them about Lord Lufton since that\nevening, now more than a month ago, on which they had been walking\ntogether in the garden. Lucy had so demeaned herself on that occasion\nas to make her sister-in-law quite sure that there had been no love\npassages up to that time; and nothing had since occurred which had\ncreated any suspicion in Mrs. Robarts' mind. She had seen at once\nthat all the close intimacy between them was over, and thought that\neverything was as it should be.\n\n\"Do you know, I have an idea,\" she said in the pony-carriage that\nday, \"that Lord Lufton will marry Griselda Grantly.\" Lucy could\nnot refrain from giving a little check at the reins which she was\nholding, and she felt that the blood rushed quickly to her heart. But\nshe did not betray herself. \"Perhaps he may,\" she said, and then gave\nthe pony a little touch with her whip.\n\n\"Oh, Lucy, I won't have Puck beaten. He was going very nicely.\"\n\n\"I beg Puck's pardon. But you see when one is trusted with a whip one\nfeels such a longing to use it.\"\n\n\"Oh, but you should keep it still. I feel almost certain that Lady\nLufton would like such a match.\"\n\n\"I daresay she might. Miss Grantly will have a large fortune, I\nbelieve.\"\n\n\"It is not that altogether: but she is the sort of young lady that\nLady Lufton likes. She is ladylike and very beautiful--\"\n\n\"Come, Fanny!\"\n\n\"I really think she is; not what I should call lovely, you know, but\nvery beautiful. And then she is quiet and reserved; she does not\nrequire excitement, and I am sure is conscientious in the performance\nof her duties.\"\n\n\"Very conscientious, I have no doubt,\" said Lucy, with something like\na sneer in her tone. \"But the question, I suppose, is, whether Lord\nLufton likes her.\"\n\n\"I think he does,--in a sort of way. He did not talk to her so much\nas he did to you--\"\n\n\"Ah! that was all Lady Lufton's fault, because she didn't have him\nproperly labelled.\"\n\n\"There does not seem to have been much harm done?\"\n\n\"Oh! by God's mercy, very little. As for me, I shall get over it in\nthree or four years I don't doubt--that's if I can get ass's milk and\nchange of air.\"\n\n\"We'll take you to Barchester for that. But as I was saying, I really\ndo think Lord Lufton likes Griselda Grantly.\"\n\n\"Then I really do think that he has uncommon bad taste,\" said Lucy,\nwith a reality in her voice differing much from the tone of banter\nshe had hitherto used.\n\n\"What, Lucy!\" said her sister-in-law, looking at her. \"Then I fear we\nshall really want the ass's milk.\"\n\n\"Perhaps, considering my position, I ought to know nothing of Lord\nLufton, for you say that it is very dangerous for young ladies to\nknow young gentlemen. But I do know enough of him to understand that\nhe ought not to like such a girl as Griselda Grantly. He ought to\nknow that she is a mere automaton, cold, lifeless, spiritless, and\neven vapid. There is, I believe, nothing in her mentally, whatever\nmay be her moral excellences. To me she is more absolutely like a\nstatue than any other human being I ever saw. To sit still and be\nadmired is all that she desires; and if she cannot get that, to sit\nstill and not be admired would almost suffice for her. I do not\nworship Lady Lufton as you do; but I think quite well enough of her\nto wonder that she should choose such a girl as that for her son's\nwife. That she does wish it, I do not doubt. But I shall indeed be\nsurprised if he wishes it also.\" And then as she finished her speech,\nLucy again flogged the pony. This she did in vexation, because she\nfelt that the tell-tale blood had suffused her face.\n\n\"Why, Lucy, if he were your brother you could not be more eager about\nit.\"\n\n\"No, I could not. He is the only man friend with whom I was ever\nintimate, and I cannot bear to think that he should throw himself\naway. It's horridly improper to care about such a thing, I have no\ndoubt.\"\n\n\"I think we might acknowledge that if he and his mother are both\nsatisfied, we may be satisfied also.\"\n\n\"I shall not be satisfied. It's no use your looking at me, Fanny. You\nwill make me talk of it, and I won't tell a lie on the subject. I do\nlike Lord Lufton very much; and I do dislike Griselda Grantly almost\nas much. Therefore I shall not be satisfied if they become man and\nwife. However, I do not suppose that either of them will ask my\nconsent; nor is it probable that Lady Lufton will do so.\" And then\nthey went on for perhaps a quarter of a mile without speaking.\n\n\"Poor Puck!\" at last Lucy said. \"He shan't be whipped any more, shall\nhe, because Miss Grantly looks like a statue? And, Fanny, don't tell\nMark to put me into a lunatic asylum. I also know a hawk from a\nheron, and that's why I don't like to see such a very unfitting\nmarriage.\" There was then nothing more said on the subject, and in\ntwo minutes they arrived at the house of the Hogglestock clergyman.\n\nMrs. Crawley had brought two children with her when she came from the\nCornish curacy to Hogglestock, and two other babies had been added to\nher cares since then. One of these was now ill with croup, and it was\nwith the object of offering to the mother some comfort and solace,\nthat the present visit was made. The two ladies got down from their\ncarriage, having obtained the services of a boy to hold Puck, and\nsoon found themselves in Mrs. Crawley's single sitting-room. She was\nsitting there with her foot on the board of a child's cradle, rocking\nit, while an infant about three months old was lying in her lap. For\nthe elder one, who was the sufferer, had in her illness usurped the\nbaby's place. Two other children, considerably older, were also in\nthe room. The eldest was a girl, perhaps nine years of age, and the\nother a boy three years her junior. These were standing at their\nfather's elbow, who was studiously endeavouring to initiate them in\nthe early mysteries of grammar. To tell the truth Mrs. Robarts would\nmuch have preferred that Mr. Crawley had not been there, for she had\nwith her and about her certain contraband articles, presents for the\nchildren, as they were to be called, but in truth relief for that\npoor, much-tasked mother, which they knew it would be impossible to\nintroduce in Mr. Crawley's presence.\n\nShe, as we have said, was not quite so gaunt, not altogether so\nhaggard as in the latter of those dreadful Cornish days. Lady Lufton\nand Mrs. Arabin between them, and the scanty comfort of their\nimproved, though still wretched income, had done something towards\nbringing her back to the world in which she had lived in the soft\ndays of her childhood. But even the liberal stipend of a hundred\nand thirty pounds a-year--liberal according to the scale by which\nthe incomes of clergymen in some of our new districts are now\napportioned--would not admit of a gentleman with his wife and four\nchildren living with the ordinary comforts of an artisan's family. As\nregards the mere eating and drinking, the amounts of butcher's meat\nand tea and butter, they of course were used in quantities which any\nartisan would have regarded as compatible only with demi-starvation.\nBetter clothing for her children was necessary, and better clothing\nfor him. As for her own raiment, the wives of few artisans would have\nbeen content to put up with Mrs. Crawley's best gown. The stuff of\nwhich it was made had been paid for by her mother when she with much\ndifficulty bestowed upon her daughter her modest wedding _trousseau_.\n\nLucy had never seen Mrs. Crawley. These visits to Hogglestock were\nnot frequent, and had generally been made by Lady Lufton and Mrs.\nRobarts together. It was known that they were distasteful to Mr.\nCrawley, who felt a savage satisfaction in being left to himself.\nIt may almost be said of him that he felt angry with those who\nrelieved him, and he had certainly never as yet forgiven the Dean\nof Barchester for paying his debts. The dean had also given him his\npresent living; and consequently his old friend was not now so dear\nto him as when in old days he would come down to that farm-house,\nalmost as penniless as the curate himself. Then they would walk\ntogether for hours along the rock-bound shore, listening to the\nwaves, discussing deep polemical mysteries, sometimes with hot fury,\nthen again with tender, loving charity, but always with a mutual\nacknowledgment of each other's truth. Now they lived comparatively\nnear together, but no opportunities arose for such discussions. At\nany rate once a quarter Mr. Crawley was pressed by his old friend to\nvisit him at the deanery, and Dr. Arabin had promised that no one\nelse should be in the house if Mr. Crawley objected to society. But\nthis was not what he wanted. The finery and grandeur of the deanery,\nand the comfort of that warm, snug library, would silence him at\nonce. Why did not Dr. Arabin come out there to Hogglestock, and tramp\nwith him through the dirty lanes as they used to tramp? Then he could\nhave enjoyed himself; then he could have talked; then old days would\nhave come back to them. But now!--\"Arabin always rides on a sleek,\nfine horse, now-a-days,\" he once said to his wife with a sneer. His\npoverty had been so terrible to himself that it was not in his heart\nto love a rich friend.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\nHOGGLESTOCK PARSONAGE.\n\n\nAt the end of the last chapter, we left Lucy Robarts waiting for an\nintroduction to Mrs. Crawley, who was sitting with one baby in her\nlap while she was rocking another who lay in a cradle at her feet.\nMr. Crawley, in the meanwhile, had risen from his seat with his\nfinger between the leaves of an old grammar out of which he had been\nteaching his two elder children. The whole Crawley family was thus\nbefore them when Mrs. Robarts and Lucy entered the sitting-room.\n\n\n[Illustration: The Crawley Family.]\n\n\n\"This is my sister-in-law, Lucy,\" said Mrs. Robarts. \"Pray don't move\nnow, Mrs. Crawley; or if you do, let me take baby.\" And she put out\nher arms and took the infant into them, making him quite at home\nthere; for she had work of this kind of her own, at home, which she\nby no means neglected, though the attendance of nurses was more\nplentiful with her than at Hogglestock.\n\nMrs. Crawley did get up, and told Lucy that she was glad to see her,\nand Mr. Crawley came forward, grammar in hand, looking humble and\nmeek. Could we have looked into the innermost spirit of him and his\nlife's partner, we should have seen that mixed with the pride of his\npoverty there was some feeling of disgrace that he was poor, but that\nwith her, regarding this matter, there was neither pride nor shame.\nThe realities of life had become so stern to her that the outward\naspects of them were as nothing. She would have liked a new gown\nbecause it would have been useful; but it would have been nothing to\nher if all the county knew that the one in which she went to church\nhad been turned three times. It galled him, however, to think that he\nand his were so poorly dressed.\n\n\"I am afraid you can hardly find a chair, Miss Robarts,\" said Mr.\nCrawley.\n\n\"Oh, yes; there is nothing here but this young gentleman's library,\"\nsaid Lucy, moving a pile of ragged, coverless books on to the table.\n\"I hope he'll forgive me for moving them.\"\n\n\"They are not Bob's,--at least, not the most of them,--but mine,\"\nsaid the girl.\n\n\"But some of them are mine,\" said the boy; \"ain't they, Grace?\"\n\n\"And are you a great scholar?\" asked Lucy, drawing the child to her.\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Grace, with a sheepish face. \"I am in Greek\nDelectus and the irregular verbs.\"\n\n\"Greek Delectus and the irregular verbs!\" And Lucy put up her hands\nwith astonishment.\n\n\"And she knows an ode of Horace all by heart,\" said Bob.\n\n\"An ode of Horace!\" said Lucy, still holding the young shamefaced\nfemale prodigy close to her knees.\n\n\"It is all that I can give them,\" said Mr. Crawley, apologetically.\n\"A little scholarship is the only fortune that has come in my way,\nand I endeavour to share that with my children.\"\n\n\"I believe men say that it is the best fortune any of us can have,\"\nsaid Lucy, thinking, however, in her own mind, that Horace and the\nirregular Greek verbs savoured too much of precocious forcing in a\nyoung lady of nine years old. But, nevertheless, Grace was a pretty,\nsimple-looking girl, and clung to her ally closely, and seemed to\nlike being fondled. So that Lucy anxiously wished that Mr. Crawley\ncould be got rid of and the presents produced.\n\n\"I hope you have left Mr. Robarts quite well,\" said Mr. Crawley, with\na stiff, ceremonial voice, differing very much from that in which he\nhad so energetically addressed his brother clergyman when they were\nalone together in the study at Framley.\n\n\"He is quite well, thank you. I suppose you have heard of his good\nfortune?\"\n\n\"Yes; I have heard of it,\" said Mr. Crawley, gravely. \"I hope that\nhis promotion may tend in every way to his advantage here and\nhereafter.\"\n\nIt seemed, however, to be manifest from the manner in which he\nexpressed his kind wishes, that his hopes and expectations did not go\nhand-in-hand together.\n\n\"By-the-by, he desired us to say that he will call here to-morrow; at\nabout eleven, didn't he say, Fanny?\"\n\n\"Yes; he wishes to see you about some parish business, I think,\" said\nMrs. Robarts, looking up for a moment from the anxious discussion in\nwhich she was already engaged with Mrs. Crawley on nursery matters.\n\n\"Pray tell him,\" said Mr. Crawley, \"that I shall be happy to see him;\nthough, perhaps, now that new duties have been thrown upon him, it\nwill be better that I should visit him at Framley.\"\n\n\"His new duties do not disturb him much as yet,\" said Lucy. \"And his\nriding over here will be no trouble to him.\"\n\n\"Yes; there he has the advantage over me. I unfortunately have no\nhorse.\"\n\nAnd then Lucy began petting the little boy, and by degrees slipped a\nsmall bag of gingerbread-nuts out of her muff into his hands. She had\nnot the patience necessary for waiting, as had her sister-in-law.\n\nThe boy took the bag, peeped into it, and then looked up into her\nface.\n\n\"What is that, Bob?\" said Mr. Crawley.\n\n\"Gingerbread,\" faltered Bobby, feeling that a sin had been committed,\nthough, probably, feeling also that he himself could hardly as yet be\naccounted as deeply guilty.\n\n\"Miss Robarts,\" said the father, \"we are very much obliged to you;\nbut our children are hardly used to such things.\"\n\n\"I am a lady with a weak mind, Mr. Crawley, and always carry things\nof this sort about with me when I go to visit children; so you must\nforgive me, and allow your little boy to accept them.\"\n\n\"Oh, certainly. Bob, my child, give the bag to your mamma, and she\nwill let you and Grace have them, one at a time.\" And then the bag in\na solemn manner was carried over to their mother, who, taking it from\nher son's hands, laid it high on a bookshelf.\n\n\"And not one now?\" said Lucy Robarts, very piteously. \"Don't be so\nhard, Mr. Crawley,--not upon them, but upon me. May I not learn\nwhether they are good of their kind?\"\n\n\"I am sure they are very good; but I think their mamma will prefer\ntheir being put by for the present.\"\n\nThis was very discouraging to Lucy. If one small bag of\ngingerbread-nuts created so great a difficulty, how was she to\ndispose of the pot of guava jelly and box of bonbons, which were\nstill in her muff; or how distribute the packet of oranges with which\nthe pony-carriage was laden? And there was jelly for the sick child,\nand chicken broth, which was, indeed, another jelly; and, to tell the\ntruth openly, there was also a joint of fresh pork and a basket of\neggs from the Framley Parsonage farmyard, which Mrs. Robarts was to\nintroduce, should she find herself capable of doing so; but which\nwould certainly be cast out with utter scorn by Mr. Crawley, if\ntendered in his immediate presence. There had also been a suggestion\nas to adding two or three bottles of port; but the courage of the\nladies had failed them on that head, and the wine was not now added\nto their difficulties.\n\nLucy found it very difficult to keep up a conversation with Mr.\nCrawley--the more so, as Mrs. Robarts and Mrs. Crawley presently\nwithdrew into a bedroom, taking the two younger children with them.\n\"How unlucky,\" thought Lucy, \"that she has not got my muff with her!\"\nBut the muff lay in her lap, ponderous with its rich enclosures.\n\n\"I suppose you will live in Barchester for a portion of the year\nnow,\" said Mr. Crawley.\n\n\"I really do not know as yet; Mark talks of taking lodgings for his\nfirst month's residence.\"\n\n\"But he will have the house, will he not?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; I suppose so.\"\n\n\"I fear he will find it interfere with his own parish--with his\ngeneral utility there: the schools, for instance.\"\n\n\"Mark thinks that, as he is so near, he need not be much absent from\nFramley, even during his residence. And then Lady Lufton is so good\nabout the schools.\"\n\n\"Ah! yes; but Lady Lufton is not a clergyman, Miss Robarts.\"\n\nIt was on Lucy's tongue to say that her ladyship was pretty nearly as\nbad, but she stopped herself.\n\nAt this moment Providence sent great relief to Miss Robarts in the\nshape of Mrs. Crawley's red-armed maid-of-all-work, who, walking up\nto her master, whispered into his ear that he was wanted. It was the\ntime of day at which his attendance was always required in his parish\nschool; and that attendance being so punctually given, those who\nwanted him looked for him there at this hour, and if he were absent,\ndid not scruple to send for him.\n\n\"Miss Robarts, I am afraid you must excuse me,\" said he, getting up\nand taking his hat and stick. Lucy begged that she might not be at\nall in the way, and already began to speculate how she might best\nunload her treasures. \"Will you make my compliments to Mrs. Robarts,\nand say that I am sorry to miss the pleasure of wishing her good-bye?\nBut I shall probably see her as she passes the school-house.\" And\nthen, stick in hand, he walked forth, and Lucy fancied that Bobby's\neyes immediately rested on the bag of gingerbread-nuts.\n\n\"Bob,\" said she, almost in a whisper, \"do you like sugar-plums?\"\n\n\"Very much indeed,\" said Bob, with exceeding gravity, and with his\neye upon the window to see whether his father had passed.\n\n\"Then come here,\" said Lucy. But as she spoke the door again opened,\nand Mr. Crawley reappeared. \"I have left a book behind me,\" he\nsaid; and, coming back through the room, he took up the well-worn\nprayer-book which accompanied him in all his wanderings through\nthe parish. Bobby, when he saw his father, had retreated a few\nsteps back, as also did Grace, who, to confess the truth, had been\nattracted by the sound of sugar-plums, in spite of the irregular\nverbs. And Lucy withdrew her hand from her muff, and looked guilty.\nWas she not deceiving the good man--nay, teaching his own children to\ndeceive him? But there are men made of such stuff that an angel could\nhardly live with them without some deceit.\n\n\"Papa's gone now,\" whispered Bobby; \"I saw him turn round the\ncorner.\" He, at any rate, had learned his lesson--as it was natural\nthat he should do.\n\nSome one else, also, had learned that papa was gone; for while Bob\nand Grace were still counting the big lumps of sugar-candy, each\nemployed the while for inward solace with an inch of barley-sugar,\nthe front-door opened, and a big basket, and a bundle done up in a\nkitchen-cloth, made surreptitious entrance into the house, and\nwere quickly unpacked by Mrs. Robarts herself on the table in Mrs.\nCrawley's bedroom.\n\n\"I did venture to bring them,\" said Fanny, with a look of shame, \"for\nI know how a sick child occupies the whole house.\"\n\n\"Ah! my friend,\" said Mrs. Crawley, taking hold of Mrs. Robarts' arm\nand looking into her face, \"that sort of shame is over with me. God\nhas tried us with want, and for my children's sake I am glad of such\nrelief.\"\n\n\"But will he be angry?\"\n\n\"I will manage it. Dear Mrs. Robarts, you must not be surprised at\nhim. His lot is sometimes very hard to bear: such things are so much\nworse for a man than for a woman.\"\n\nFanny was not quite prepared to admit this in her own heart, but she\nmade no reply on that head. \"I am sure I hope we may be able to be\nof use to you,\" she said, \"if you will only look upon me as an old\nfriend, and write to me if you want me. I hesitate to come frequently\nfor fear that I should offend him.\"\n\nAnd then, by degrees, there was confidence between them, and the\npoverty-stricken helpmate of the perpetual curate was able to speak\nof the weight of her burden to the well-to-do young wife of the\nBarchester prebendary. \"It was hard,\" the former said, \"to feel\nherself so different from the wives of other clergymen around\nher--to know that they lived softly, while she, with all the work\nof her hands, and unceasing struggle of her energies, could hardly\nmanage to place wholesome food before her husband and children. It\nwas a terrible thing--a grievous thing to think of, that all the\nwork of her mind should be given up to such subjects as these. But,\nnevertheless, she could bear it,\" she said, \"as long as he would\ncarry himself like a man, and face his lot boldly before the world.\"\nAnd then she told how he had been better there at Hogglestock than\nin their former residence down in Cornwall, and in warm language she\nexpressed her thanks to the friend who had done so much for them.\n\n\"Mrs. Arabin told me that she was so anxious you should go to them,\"\nsaid Mrs. Robarts.\n\n\"Ah, yes; but that I fear is impossible. The children, you know, Mrs.\nRobarts.\"\n\n\"I would take care of two of them for you.\"\n\n\"Oh, no; I could not punish you for your goodness in that way. But\nhe would not go. He could go and leave me at home. Sometimes I have\nthought that it might be so, and I have done all in my power to\npersuade him. I have told him that if he could mix once more with the\nworld, with the clerical world, you know, that he would be better\nfitted for the performance of his own duties. But he answers me\nangrily, that it is impossible--that his coat is not fit for the\ndean's table,\" and Mrs. Crawley almost blushed as she spoke of such a\nreason.\n\n\"What! with an old friend like Dr. Arabin? Surely that must be\nnonsense.\"\n\n\"I know that it is. The dean would be glad to see him with any coat.\nBut the fact is that he cannot bear to enter the house of a rich man\nunless his duty calls him there.\"\n\n\"But surely that is a mistake?\"\n\n\"It is a mistake. But what can I do? I fear that he regards the rich\nas his enemies. He is pining for the solace of some friend to whom\nhe could talk--for some equal, with a mind educated like his own, to\nwhose thoughts he could listen, and to whom he could speak his own\nthoughts. But such a friend must be equal, not only in mind, but in\npurse; and where can he ever find such a man as that?\"\n\n\"But you may get better preferment.\"\n\n\"Ah, no; and if he did, we are hardly fit for it now. If I could\nthink that I could educate my children; if I could only do something\nfor my poor Grace--\"\n\nIn answer to this Mrs. Robarts said a word or two, but not much.\nShe resolved, however, that if she could get her husband's leave,\nsomething should be done for Grace. Would it not be a good work? and\nwas it not incumbent on her to make some kindly use of all the goods\nwith which Providence had blessed herself?\n\nAnd then they went back to the sitting-room, each again with a young\nchild in her arms, Mrs. Crawley having stowed away in the kitchen the\nchicken broth and the leg of pork and the supply of eggs. Lucy had\nbeen engaged the while with the children, and when the two married\nladies entered, they found that a shop had been opened at which\nall manner of luxuries were being readily sold and purchased at\nmarvellously easy prices; the guava jelly was there, and the oranges,\nand the sugar-plums, red and yellow and striped; and, moreover, the\ngingerbread had been taken down in the audacity of their commercial\nspeculations, and the nuts were spread out upon a board, behind which\nLucy stood as shop-girl, disposing of them for kisses.\n\n\"Mamma, mamma,\" said Bobby, running up to his mother, \"you must buy\nsomething of her,\" and he pointed with his fingers at the shop-girl.\n\"You must give her two kisses for that heap of barley-sugar.\" Looking\nat Bobby's mouth at the time, one would have said that his kisses\nmight be dispensed with.\n\nWhen they were again in the pony-carriage, behind the impatient Puck,\nand were well away from the door, Fanny was the first to speak.\n\n\"How very different those two are,\" she said; \"different in their\nminds and in their spirit!\"\n\n\"But how much higher toned is her mind than his! How weak he is in\nmany things, and how strong she is in everything! How false is his\npride, and how false his shame!\"\n\n\"But we must remember what he has to bear. It is not every one that\ncan endure such a life as his without false pride and false shame.\"\n\n\"But she has neither,\" said Lucy.\n\n\"Because you have one hero in a family, does that give you a right to\nexpect another?\" said Mrs. Robarts. \"Of all my own acquaintance, Mrs.\nCrawley, I think, comes nearest to heroism.\"\n\nAnd then they passed by the Hogglestock school, and Mr. Crawley, when\nhe heard the noise of the wheels, came out.\n\n\"You have been very kind,\" said he, \"to remain so long with my poor\nwife.\"\n\n\"We had a great many things to talk about, after you went.\"\n\n\"It is very kind of you, for she does not often see a friend,\nnow-a-days. Will you have the goodness to tell Mr. Robarts that I\nshall be here at the school, at eleven o'clock to-morrow?\"\n\nAnd then he bowed, taking off his hat to them, and they drove on.\n\n\"If he really does care about her comfort, I shall not think so badly\nof him,\" said Lucy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\nTHE TRIUMPH OF THE GIANTS.\n\n\nAnd now about the end of April news arrived almost simultaneously\nin all quarters of the habitable globe that was terrible in its\nimport to one of the chief persons of our history;--some may\nthink to the chief person in it. All high parliamentary people\nwill doubtless so think, and the wives and daughters of such. The\nTitans warring against the gods had been for awhile successful.\nTyphoeus and Mimas, Porphyrion and Rhoecus, the giant brood of\nold, steeped in ignorance and wedded to corruption, had scaled the\nheights of Olympus, assisted by that audacious flinger of deadly\nponderous missiles, who stands ever ready armed with his terrific\nsling--Supplehouse, the Enceladus of the press. And in this universal\ncataclasm of the starry councils, what could a poor Diana do, Diana\nof the Petty Bag, but abandon her pride of place to some rude Orion?\nIn other words, the ministry had been compelled to resign, and with\nthem Mr. Harold Smith.\n\n\"And so poor Harold is out, before he has well tasted the sweets of\noffice,\" said Sowerby, writing to his friend the parson; \"and as far\nas I know, the only piece of Church patronage which has fallen in\nthe way of the ministry since he joined it, has made its way down to\nFramley--to my great joy and contentment.\" But it hardly tended to\nMark's joy and contentment on the same subject that he should be so\noften reminded of the benefit conferred upon him.\n\nTerrible was this break-down of the ministry, and especially to\nHarold Smith, who to the last had had confidence in that theory of\nnew blood. He could hardly believe that a large majority of the House\nshould vote against a government which he had only just joined. \"If\nwe are to go on in this way,\" he said to his young friend Green\nWalker, \"the Queen's government cannot be carried on.\" That alleged\ndifficulty as to carrying on the Queen's government has been\nfrequently mooted in late years since a certain great man first\nintroduced the idea. Nevertheless, the Queen's government is carried\non, and the propensity and aptitude of men for this work seems to be\nnot at all on the decrease. If we have but few young statesmen, it is\nbecause the old stagers are so fond of the rattle of their harness.\n\n\"I really do not see how the Queen's government is to be carried on,\"\nsaid Harold Smith to Green Walker, standing in a corner of one of the\nlobbies of the House of Commons on the first of those days of awful\ninterest, in which the Queen was sending for one crack statesman\nafter another; and some anxious men were beginning to doubt whether\nor no we should, in truth, be able to obtain the blessing of another\ncabinet. The gods had all vanished from their places. Would the\ngiants be good enough to do anything for us or no? There were men who\nseemed to think that the giants would refuse to do anything for us.\n\"The House will now be adjourned over till Monday, and I would not be\nin her Majesty's shoes for something,\" said Mr. Harold Smith.\n\n\"By Jove! no,\" said Green Walker, who in these days was a stanch\nHarold Smithian, having felt a pride in joining himself on as a\nsubstantial support to a cabinet minister. Had he contented himself\nwith being merely a Brockite, he would have counted as nobody. \"By\nJove! no,\" and Green Walker opened his eyes and shook his head, as\nhe thought of the perilous condition in which her Majesty must be\nplaced. \"I happen to know that Lord ---- won't join them unless he\nhas the Foreign Office,\" and he mentioned some hundred-handed Gyas\nsupposed to be of the utmost importance to the counsels of the\nTitans.\n\n\"And that, of course, is impossible. I don't see what on earth\nthey are to do. There's Sidonia; they do say that he's making some\ndifficulty now.\" Now Sidonia was another giant, supposed to be very\npowerful.\n\n\"We all know that the Queen won't see him,\" said Green Walker, who,\nbeing a member of Parliament for the Crewe Junction, and nephew to\nLady Hartletop, of course had perfectly correct means of ascertaining\nwhat the Queen would do, and what she would not.\n\n\"The fact is,\" said Harold Smith, recurring again to his own\nsituation as an ejected god, \"that the House does not in the least\nunderstand what it is about;--doesn't know what it wants. The\nquestion I should like to ask them is this: do they intend that the\nQueen shall have a government, or do they not? Are they prepared to\nsupport such men as Sidonia and Lord De Terrier? If so, I am their\nobedient humble servant; but I shall be very much surprised, that's\nall.\" Lord De Terrier was at this time recognized by all men as the\nleader of the giants.\n\n\"And so shall I,--deucedly surprised. They can't do it, you know.\nThere are the Manchester men. I ought to know something about them\ndown in my country; and I say they can't support Lord De Terrier. It\nwouldn't be natural.\"\n\n\"Natural! Human nature has come to an end, I think,\" said Harold\nSmith, who could hardly understand that the world should conspire to\nthrow over a government which he had joined, and that, too, before\nthe world had waited to see how much he would do for it; \"the fact\nis this, Walker, we have no longer among us any strong feeling of\nparty.\"\n\n\"No, not a d----,\" said Green Walker, who was very energetic in his\npresent political aspirations.\n\n\"And till we can recover that, we shall never be able to have a\ngovernment firm-seated and sure-handed. Nobody can count on men\nfrom one week to another. The very members who in one month place\na minister in power, are the very first to vote against him in the\nnext.\"\n\n\"We must put a stop to that sort of thing, otherwise we shall never\ndo any good.\"\n\n\"I don't mean to deny that Brock was wrong with reference to Lord\nBrittleback. I think that he was wrong, and I said so all through.\nBut, heavens on earth--!\" and instead of completing his speech Harold\nSmith turned away his head, and struck his hands together in token of\nhis astonishment at the fatuity of the age. What he probably meant to\nexpress was this: that if such a good deed as that late appointment\nmade at the Petty Bag Office were not held sufficient to atone for\nthat other evil deed to which he had alluded, there would be an end\nof all justice in sublunary matters. Was no offence to be forgiven,\neven when so great virtue had been displayed?\n\n\"I attribute it all to Supplehouse,\" said Green Walker, trying to\nconsole his friend.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Harold Smith, now verging on the bounds of parliamentary\neloquence, although he still spoke with bated breath, and to one\nsolitary hearer. \"Yes; we are becoming the slaves of a mercenary and\nirresponsible press--of one single newspaper. There is a man endowed\nwith no great talent, enjoying no public confidence, untrusted as a\npolitician, and unheard of even as a writer by the world at large,\nand yet, because he is on the staff of the _Jupiter_, he is able to\noverturn the government and throw the whole country into dismay. It\nis astonishing to me that a man like Lord Brock should allow himself\nto be so timid.\" And nevertheless it was not yet a month since Harold\nSmith had been counselling with Supplehouse how a series of strong\narticles in the _Jupiter_, together with the expected support of the\nManchester men, might probably be effective in hurling the minister\nfrom his seat. But at that time the minister had not revigorated\nhimself with young blood. \"How the Queen's government is to be\ncarried on, that is the question now,\" Harold Smith repeated. A\ndifficulty which had not caused him much dismay at that period, about\na month since, to which we have alluded.\n\nAt this moment Sowerby and Supplehouse together joined them, having\ncome out of the House, in which some unimportant business had been\ncompleted after the minister's notice of adjournment.\n\n\"Well, Harold,\" said Sowerby, \"what do you say to your governor's\nstatement?\"\n\n\"I have nothing to say to it,\" said Harold Smith, looking up very\nsolemnly from under the penthouse of his hat, and, perhaps, rather\nsavagely. Sowerby had supported the government at the late crisis;\nbut why was he now seen herding with such a one as Supplehouse?\n\n\"He did it pretty well, I think,\" said Sowerby.\n\n\"Very well, indeed,\" said Supplehouse; \"as he always does those sort\nof things. No man makes so good an explanation of circumstances, or\ncomes out with so telling a personal statement. He ought to keep\nhimself in reserve for those sort of things.\"\n\n\"And who in the meantime is to carry on the Queen's government?\" said\nHarold Smith, looking very stern.\n\n\"That should be left to men of lesser mark,\" said he of the\n_Jupiter_. \"The points as to which one really listens to a minister,\nthe subjects about which men really care, are always personal. How\nmany of us are truly interested as to the best mode of governing\nIndia? But in a question touching the character of a prime minister\nwe all muster together like bees round a sounding cymbal.\"\n\n\"That arises from envy, malice, and all uncharitableness,\" said\nHarold Smith.\n\n\"Yes; and from picking and stealing, evil speaking, lying, and\nslandering,\" said Mr. Sowerby.\n\n\"We are so prone to desire and covet other men's places,\" said\nSupplehouse.\n\n\"Some men are so,\" said Sowerby; \"but it is the evil speaking, lying,\nand slandering, which does the mischief. Is it not, Harold?\"\n\n\"And in the meantime how is the Queen's government to be carried on?\"\nsaid Mr. Green Walker.\n\nOn the following morning it was known that Lord De Terrier was with\nthe Queen at Buckingham Palace, and at about twelve a list of the new\nministry was published, which must have been in the highest degree\nsatisfactory to the whole brood of giants. Every son of Tellus was\nincluded in it, as were also very many of the daughters. But then,\nlate in the afternoon, Lord Brock was again summoned to the palace,\nand it was thought in the West End among the clubs that the gods had\nagain a chance. \"If only,\" said the _Purist_, an evening paper which\nwas supposed to be very much in the interest of Mr. Harold Smith, \"if\nonly Lord Brock can have the wisdom to place the right men in the\nright places. It was only the other day that he introduced Mr. Smith\ninto his government. That this was a step in the right direction\nevery one has acknowledged, though unfortunately it was made too\nlate to prevent the disturbance which has since occurred. It now\nappears probable that his lordship will again have an opportunity\nof selecting a list of statesmen with the view of carrying on the\nQueen's government; and it is to be hoped that such men as Mr. Smith\nmay be placed in situations in which their talents, industry, and\nacknowledged official aptitudes, may be of permanent service to the\ncountry.\"\n\nSupplehouse, when he read this at the club with Mr. Sowerby at his\nelbow, declared that the style was too well marked to leave any doubt\nas to the author; but we ourselves are not inclined to think that Mr.\nHarold Smith wrote the article himself, although it may be probable\nthat he saw it in type.\n\nBut the _Jupiter_ the next morning settled the whole question, and\nmade it known to the world that, in spite of all the sendings and\nre-sendings, Lord Brock and the gods were permanently out, and Lord\nDe Terrier and the giants permanently in. That fractious giant who\nwould only go to the Foreign Office had, in fact, gone to some sphere\nof much less important duty, and Sidonia, in spite of the whispered\ndislike of an illustrious personage, opened the campaign with all the\nfull appanages of a giant of the highest standing. \"We hope,\" said\nthe _Jupiter_, \"that Lord Brock may not yet be too old to take a\nlesson. If so, the present decision of the House of Commons, and we\nmay say of the country also, may teach him not to put his trust in\nsuch princes as Lord Brittleback, or such broken reeds as Mr. Harold\nSmith.\" Now this parting blow we always thought to be exceedingly\nunkind, and altogether unnecessary, on the part of Mr. Supplehouse.\n\n\"My dear,\" said Mrs. Harold, when she first met Miss Dunstable\nafter the catastrophe was known, \"how am I possibly to endure this\ndegradation?\" And she put her deeply-laced handkerchief up to her\neyes.\n\n\"Christian resignation,\" suggested Miss Dunstable.\n\n\"Fiddlestick!\" said Mrs. Harold Smith. \"You millionnaires always talk\nof Christian resignation, because you never are called on to resign\nanything. If I had any Christian resignation, I shouldn't have\ncared for such pomps and vanities. Think of it, my dear; a cabinet\nminister's wife for only three weeks!\"\n\n\"How does poor Mr. Smith endure it?\"\n\n\"What? Harold? He only lives on the hope of vengeance. When he has\nput an end to Mr. Supplehouse, he will be content to die.\"\n\nAnd then there were further explanations in both Houses of\nParliament, which were altogether satisfactory. The high-bred,\ncourteous giants assured the gods that they had piled Pelion on Ossa\nand thus climbed up into power, very much in opposition to their own\ngood-wills; for they, the giants themselves, preferred the sweets of\ndignified retirement. But the voice of the people had been too strong\nfor them; the effort had been made, not by themselves, but by others,\nwho were determined that the giants should be at the head of affairs.\nIndeed, the spirit of the times was so clearly in favour of giants\nthat there had been no alternative. So said Briareus to the Lords,\nand Orion to the Commons. And then the gods were absolutely happy in\nceding their places; and so far were they from any uncelestial envy\nor malice which might not be divine, that they promised to give the\ngiants all the assistance in their power in carrying on the work of\ngovernment; upon which the giants declared how deeply indebted they\nwould be for such valuable counsel and friendly assistance. All this\nwas delightful in the extreme; but not the less did ordinary men seem\nto expect that the usual battle would go on in the old customary way.\nIt is easy to love one's enemy when one is making fine speeches; but\nso difficult to do so in the actual everyday work of life.\n\nBut there was and always has been this peculiar good point about the\ngiants, that they are never too proud to follow in the footsteps\nof the gods. If the gods, deliberating painfully together, have\nelaborated any skilful project, the giants are always willing to\nadopt it as their own, not treating the bantling as a foster-child,\nbut praising it and pushing it so that men should regard it as the\nundoubted offspring of their own brains. Now just at this time there\nhad been a plan much thought of for increasing the number of the\nbishops. Good active bishops were very desirable, and there was a\nstrong feeling among certain excellent churchmen that there could\nhardly be too many of them. Lord Brock had his measure cut and dry.\nThere should be a Bishop of Westminster to share the Herculean\ntoils of the metropolitan prelate, and another up in the North to\nChristianize the mining interests and wash white the blackamoors of\nNewcastle: Bishop of Beverley he should be called. But, in opposition\nto this, the giants, it was known, had intended to put forth the\nwhole measure of their brute force. More curates, they said, were\nwanting, and district incumbents; not more bishops rolling in\ncarriages. That bishops should roll in carriages was very good; but\nof such blessings the English world for the present had enough. And\ntherefore Lord Brock and the gods had had much fear as to their\nlittle project.\n\nBut now, immediately on the accession of the giants, it was known\nthat the bishop bill was to be gone on with immediately. Some small\nchanges would be effected so that the bill should be gigantic rather\nthan divine; but the result would be altogether the same. It must,\nhowever, be admitted that bishops appointed by ourselves may be very\ngood things, whereas those appointed by our adversaries will be\nanything but good. And, no doubt, this feeling went a long way with\nthe giants. Be that as it may, the new bishop bill was to be their\nfirst work of government, and it was to be brought forward and\ncarried, and the new prelates selected and put into their chairs all\nat once,--before the grouse should begin to crow and put an end to\nthe doings of gods as well as giants.\n\nAmong other minor effects arising from this decision was the\nfollowing, that Archdeacon and Mrs. Grantly returned to London, and\nagain took the lodgings in which they had before been staying. On\nvarious occasions also during the first week of this second sojourn,\nDr. Grantly might be seen entering the official chambers of the First\nLord of the Treasury. Much counsel was necessary among high churchmen\nof great repute before any fixed resolution could wisely be made in\nsuch a matter as this; and few churchmen stood in higher repute than\nthe Archdeacon of Barchester. And then it began to be rumoured in\nthe world that the minister had disposed at any rate of the see of\nWestminster.\n\nThis present time was a very nervous one for Mrs. Grantly. What\nmight be the aspirations of the archdeacon himself, we will not\nstop to inquire. It may be that time and experience had taught\nhim the futility of earthly honours, and made him content with\nthe comfortable opulence of his Barsetshire rectory. But there\nis no theory of church discipline which makes it necessary that\na clergyman's wife should have an objection to a bishopric. The\narchdeacon probably was only anxious to give a disinterested aid to\nthe minister, but Mrs. Grantly did long to sit in high places, and\nbe at any rate equal to Mrs. Proudie. It was for her children, she\nsaid to herself, that she was thus anxious,--that they should have a\ngood position before the world, and the means of making the best of\nthemselves. \"One is able to do nothing, you know, shut up there, down\nat Plumstead,\" she had remarked to Lady Lufton on the occasion of\nher first visit to London, and yet the time was not long past when\nshe had thought that rectory house at Plumstead to be by no means\ninsufficient or contemptible.\n\nAnd then there came a question whether or no Griselda should go\nback to her mother; but this idea was very strongly opposed by Lady\nLufton, and ultimately with success. \"I really think the dear girl is\nvery happy with me,\" said Lady Lufton; \"and if ever she is to belong\nto me more closely, it will be so well that we should know and love\none another.\"\n\nTo tell the truth, Lady Lufton had been trying hard to know and love\nGriselda, but hitherto she had scarcely succeeded to the full extent\nof her wishes. That she loved Griselda was certain,--with that sort\nof love which springs from a person's volition and not from the\njudgment. She had said all along to herself and others that she did\nlove Griselda Grantly. She had admired the young lady's face, liked\nher manner, approved of her fortune and family, and had selected her\nfor a daughter-in-law in a somewhat impetuous manner. Therefore she\nloved her. But it was by no means clear to Lady Lufton that she did\nas yet know her young friend. The match was a plan of her own, and\ntherefore she stuck to it as warmly as ever, but she began to have\nsome misgivings whether or no the dear girl would be to her herself\nall that she had dreamed of in a daughter-in-law.\n\n\"But, dear Lady Lufton,\" said Mrs. Grantly, \"is it not possible that\nwe may put her affections to too severe a test? What, if she should\nlearn to regard him, and then--\"\n\n\"Ah! if she did, I should have no fear of the result. If she showed\nanything like love for Ludovic, he would be at her feet in a moment.\nHe is impulsive, but she is not.\"\n\n\"Exactly, Lady Lufton. It is his privilege to be impulsive and to\nsue for her affection, and hers to have her love sought for without\nmaking any demonstration. It is perhaps the fault of young ladies of\nthe present day that they are too impulsive. They assume privileges\nwhich are not their own, and thus lose those which are.\"\n\n\"Quite true! I quite agree with you. It is probably that very feeling\nthat has made me think so highly of Griselda. But then--\" But then a\nyoung lady, though she need not jump down a gentleman's throat, or\nthrow herself into his face, may give some signs that she is made of\nflesh and blood; especially when her papa and mamma and all belonging\nto her are so anxious to make the path of her love run smooth. That\nwas what was passing through Lady Lufton's mind; but she did not say\nit all; she merely looked it.\n\n\"I don't think she will ever allow herself to indulge in an\nunauthorized passion,\" said Mrs. Grantly.\n\n\"I am sure she will not,\" said Lady Lufton, with ready agreement,\nfearing perhaps in her heart that Griselda would never indulge in any\npassion, authorized or unauthorized.\n\n\"I don't know whether Lord Lufton sees much of her now,\" said Mrs.\nGrantly, thinking perhaps of that promise of Lady Lufton's with\nreference to his lordship's spare time.\n\n\"Just lately, during these changes, you know, everybody has been so\nmuch engaged. Ludovic has been constantly at the House, and then men\nfind it so necessary to be at their clubs just now.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, of course,\" said Mrs. Grantly, who was not at all disposed\nto think little of the importance of the present crisis, or to wonder\nthat men should congregate together when such deeds were to be done\nas those which now occupied the breasts of the Queen's advisers.\nAt last, however, the two mothers perfectly understood each other.\nGriselda was still to remain with Lady Lufton; and was to accept her\nladyship's son, if he could only be induced to exercise his privilege\nof asking her; but in the meantime, as this seemed to be doubtful,\nGriselda was not to be debarred from her privilege of making what use\nshe could of any other string which she might have to her bow.\n\n\"But, mamma,\" said Griselda, in a moment of unwatched intercourse\nbetween the mother and daughter, \"is it really true that they are\ngoing to make papa a bishop?\"\n\n\"We can tell nothing as yet, my dear. People in the world are talking\nabout it. Your papa has been a good deal with Lord De Terrier.\"\n\n\"And isn't he prime minister?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; I am happy to say that he is.\"\n\n\"I thought the prime minister could make any one a bishop that he\nchooses,--any clergyman, that is.\"\n\n\"But there is no see vacant,\" said Mrs. Grantly.\n\n\"Then there isn't any chance,\" said Griselda, looking very glum.\n\n\"They are going to have an Act of Parliament for making two more\nbishops. That's what they are talking about at least. And if they\ndo--\"\n\n\"Papa will be Bishop of Westminster--won't he? And we shall live in\nLondon?\"\n\n\"But you must not talk about it, my dear.\"\n\n\"No, I won't. But, mamma, a Bishop of Westminster will be higher than\na Bishop of Barchester; won't he? I shall so like to be able to snub\nthose Miss Proudies.\" It will therefore be seen that there were\nmatters on which even Griselda Grantly could be animated. Like the\nrest of her family she was devoted to the Church.\n\nLate on that afternoon the archdeacon returned home to dine in Mount\nStreet, having spent the whole of the day between the Treasury\nchambers, a meeting of Convocation, and his club. And when he did get\nhome it was soon manifest to his wife that he was not laden with good\nnews.\n\n\"It is almost incredible,\" he said, standing with his back to the\ndrawing-room fire.\n\n\"What is incredible?\" said his wife, sharing her husband's anxiety to\nthe full.\n\n\"If I had not learned it as fact, I would not have believed it, even\nof Lord Brock,\" said the archdeacon.\n\n\"Learned what?\" said the anxious wife.\n\n\"After all, they are going to oppose the bill.\"\n\n\"Impossible!\" said Mrs. Grantly.\n\n\"But they are.\"\n\n\"The bill for the two new bishops, archdeacon? oppose their own\nbill!\"\n\n\"Yes--oppose their own bill. It is almost incredible; but so it is.\nSome changes have been forced upon us; little things which they\nhad forgotten--quite minor matters; and they now say that they\nwill be obliged to divide against us on these twopenny-halfpenny,\nhair-splitting points. It is Lord Brock's own doing too, after\nall that he said about abstaining from factious opposition to the\ngovernment.\"\n\n\"I believe there is nothing too bad or too false for that man,\" said\nMrs. Grantly.\n\n\"After all they said, too, when they were in power themselves, as to\nthe present government opposing the cause of religion! They declare\nnow that Lord De Terrier cannot be very anxious about it, as he had\nso many good reasons against it a few weeks ago. Is it not dreadful\nthat there should be such double-dealing in men in such positions?\"\n\n\"It is sickening,\" said Mrs. Grantly.\n\nAnd then there was a pause between them as each thought of the injury\nthat was done to them.\n\n\"But, archdeacon--\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Could you not give up those small points and shame them into\ncompliance?\"\n\n\"Nothing would shame them.\"\n\n\"But would it not be well to try?\"\n\nThe game was so good a one, and the stake so important, that Mrs.\nGrantly felt that it would be worth playing for to the last.\n\n\"It is no good.\"\n\n\"But I certainly would suggest it to Lord De Terrier. I am sure the\ncountry would go along with him; at any rate the Church would.\"\n\n\"It is impossible,\" said the archdeacon. \"To tell the truth, it did\noccur to me. But some of them down there seemed to think that it\nwould not do.\"\n\nMrs. Grantly sat awhile on the sofa, still meditating in her mind\nwhether there might not yet be some escape from so terrible a\ndownfall.\n\n\"But, archdeacon--\"\n\n\"I'll go upstairs and dress,\" said he, in despondency.\n\n\"But, archdeacon, surely the present ministry may have a majority on\nsuch a subject as that; I thought they were sure of a majority now.\"\n\n\"No; not sure.\"\n\n\"But at any rate the chances are in their favour? I do hope they'll\ndo their duty, and exert themselves to keep their members together.\"\n\nAnd then the archdeacon told out the whole of the truth.\n\n\"Lord De Terrier says that under the present circumstances he will\nnot bring the matter forward this session at all. So we had better go\nback to Plumstead.\"\n\nMrs. Grantly then felt that there was nothing further to be said, and\nit will be proper that the historian should drop a veil over their\nsufferings.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\nMAGNA EST VERITAS.\n\n\nIt was made known to the reader that in the early part of the winter\nMr. Sowerby had a scheme for retrieving his lost fortunes, and\nsetting himself right in the world, by marrying that rich heiress,\nMiss Dunstable. I fear my friend Sowerby does not, at present, stand\nhigh in the estimation of those who have come on with me thus far in\nthis narrative. He has been described as a spendthrift and gambler,\nand as one scarcely honest in his extravagance and gambling. But\nnevertheless there are worse men than Mr. Sowerby, and I am not\nprepared to say that, should he be successful with Miss Dunstable,\nthat lady would choose by any means the worst of the suitors who are\ncontinually throwing themselves at her feet. Reckless as this man\nalways appeared to be, reckless as he absolutely was, there was still\nwithin his heart a desire for better things, and in his mind an\nunderstanding that he had hitherto missed the career of an honest\nEnglish gentleman. He was proud of his position as member for his\ncounty, though hitherto he had done so little to grace it; he was\nproud of his domain at Chaldicotes, though the possession of it had\nso nearly passed out of his own hands; he was proud of the old\nblood that flowed in his veins; and he was proud also of that easy,\ncomfortable, gay manner, which went so far in the world's judgment\nto atone for his extravagance and evil practices. If only he could\nget another chance, as he now said to himself, things should go very\ndifferently with him. He would utterly forswear the whole company of\nTozers. He would cease to deal in bills, and to pay heaven only knows\nhow many hundred per cent. for his moneys. He would no longer prey\nupon his friends, and would redeem his title-deeds from the clutches\nof the Duke of Omnium. If only he could get another chance!\n\nMiss Dunstable's fortune would do all this and ever so much more, and\nthen, moreover, Miss Dunstable was a woman whom he really liked. She\nwas not soft, feminine, or pretty, nor was she very young; but she\nwas clever, self-possessed, and quite able to hold her own in any\nclass; and as to age, Mr. Sowerby was not very young himself. In\nmaking such a match he would have no cause of shame. He could speak\nof it before his friends without fear of their grimaces, and ask\nthem to his house, with the full assurance that the head of his\ntable would not disgrace him. And then as the scheme grew clearer\nand clearer to him, he declared to himself that if he should\nbe successful, he would use her well, and not rob her of her\nmoney--beyond what was absolutely necessary.\n\nHe had intended to have laid his fortunes at her feet at Chaldicotes;\nbut the lady had been coy. Then the deed was to have been done at\nGatherum Castle, but the lady ran away from Gatherum Castle just at\nthe time on which he had fixed. And since that, one circumstance\nafter another had postponed the affair in London, till now at last\nhe was resolved that he would know his fate, let it be what it might.\nIf he could not contrive that things should speedily be arranged,\nit might come to pass that he would be altogether debarred from\npresenting himself to the lady as Mr. Sowerby of Chaldicotes. Tidings\nhad reached him, through Mr. Fothergill, that the duke would be glad\nto have matters arranged; and Mr. Sowerby well knew the meaning of\nthat message.\n\nMr. Sowerby was not fighting this campaign alone, without the aid of\nany ally. Indeed, no man ever had a more trusty ally in any campaign\nthan he had in this. And it was this ally, the only faithful comrade\nthat clung to him through good and ill during his whole life, who\nfirst put it into his head that Miss Dunstable was a woman and might\nbe married.\n\n\"A hundred needy adventurers have attempted it, and failed already,\"\nMr. Sowerby had said, when the plan was first proposed to him.\n\n\"But, nevertheless, she will some day marry some one; and why not you\nas well as another?\" his sister had answered. For Mrs. Harold Smith\nwas the ally of whom I have spoken.\n\nMrs. Harold Smith, whatever may have been her faults, could boast of\nthis virtue--that she loved her brother. He was probably the only\nhuman being that she did love. Children she had none; and as for her\nhusband, it had never occurred to her to love him. She had married\nhim for a position; and being a clever woman, with a good digestion\nand command of her temper, had managed to get through the world\nwithout much of that unhappiness which usually follows ill-assorted\nmarriages. At home she managed to keep the upper hand, but she did\nso in an easy, good-humoured way that made her rule bearable; and\naway from home she assisted her lord's political standing, though\nshe laughed more keenly than any one else at his foibles. But the\nlord of her heart was her brother; and in all his scrapes, all his\nextravagances, and all his recklessness, she had ever been willing to\nassist him. With the view of doing this she had sought the intimacy\nof Miss Dunstable, and for the last year past had indulged every\ncaprice of that lady. Or rather, she had had the wit to learn that\nMiss Dunstable was to be won, not by the indulgence of caprices, but\nby free and easy intercourse, with a dash of fun, and, at any rate,\na semblance of honesty. Mrs. Harold Smith was not, perhaps, herself\nvery honest by disposition; but in these latter days she had taken up\na theory of honesty for the sake of Miss Dunstable--not altogether in\nvain, for Miss Dunstable and Mrs. Harold Smith were certainly very\nintimate.\n\n\"If I am to do it at all, I must not wait any longer,\" said Mr.\nSowerby to his sister a day or two after the final break-down of the\ngods. The affection of the sister for the brother may be imagined\nfrom the fact that at such a time she could give up her mind to\nsuch a subject. But, in truth, her husband's position as a cabinet\nminister was as nothing to her compared with her brother's position\nas a county gentleman.\n\n\"One time is as good as another,\" said Mrs. Harold Smith.\n\n\"You mean that you would advise me to ask her at once.\"\n\n\"Certainly. But you must remember, Nat, that you will have no easy\ntask. It will not do for you to kneel down and swear that you love\nher.\"\n\n\"If I do it at all, I shall certainly do it without kneeling--you may\nbe sure of that, Harriet.\"\n\n\"Yes, and without swearing that you love her. There is only one way\nin which you can be successful with Miss Dunstable--you must tell her\nthe truth.\"\n\n\"What!--tell her that I am ruined, horse, foot, and dragoons, and\nthen bid her help me out of the mire?\"\n\n\"Exactly: that will be your only chance, strange as it may appear.\"\n\n\"This is very different from what you used to say, down at\nChaldicotes.\"\n\n\"So it is; but I know her much better than I did when we were there.\nSince then I have done but little else than study the freaks of her\ncharacter. If she really likes you--and I think she does--she could\nforgive you any other crime but that of swearing that you loved her.\"\n\n\"I should hardly know how to propose without saying something about\nit.\"\n\n\"But you must say nothing--not a word; you must tell her that you are\na gentleman of good blood and high station, but sadly out at elbows.\"\n\n\"She knows that already.\"\n\n\"Of course she does; but she must know it as coming directly from\nyour own mouth. And then tell her that you propose to set yourself\nright by marrying her--by marrying her for the sake of her money.\"\n\n\"That will hardly win her, I should say.\"\n\n\"If it does not, no other way, that I know of, will do so. As I told\nyou before, it will be no easy task. Of course you must make her\nunderstand that her happiness shall be cared for; but that must not\nbe put prominently forward as your object. Your first object is her\nmoney, and your only chance for success is in telling the truth.\"\n\n\"It is very seldom that a man finds himself in such a position as\nthat,\" said Sowerby, walking up and down his sister's room; \"and,\nupon my word, I don't think I am up to the task. I should certainly\nbreak down. I don't believe there's a man in London could go to a\nwoman with such a story as that, and then ask her to marry him.\"\n\n\"If you cannot, you may as well give it up,\" said Mrs. Harold\nSmith. \"But if you can do it--if you can go through with it in that\nmanner--my own opinion is that your chance of success would not be\nbad. The fact is,\" added the sister after awhile, during which her\nbrother was continuing his walk and meditating on the difficulties\nof his position--\"the fact is, you men never understand a woman; you\ngive her credit neither for her strength, nor for her weakness. You\nare too bold, and too timid: you think she is a fool and tell her so,\nand yet never can trust her to do a kind action. Why should she not\nmarry you with the intention of doing you a good turn? After all, she\nwould lose very little: there is the estate, and if she redeemed it,\nit would belong to her as well as to you.\"\n\n\"It would be a good turn, indeed. I fear I should be too modest to\nput it to her in that way.\"\n\n\"Her position would be much better as your wife than it is at\npresent. You are good-humoured and good-tempered, you would intend to\ntreat her well, and, on the whole, she would be much happier as Mrs.\nSowerby, of Chaldicotes, than she can be in her present position.\"\n\n\"If she cared about being married, I suppose she could be a peer's\nwife to-morrow.\"\n\n\"But I don't think she cares about being a peer's wife. A needy peer\nmight perhaps win her in the way that I propose to you; but then a\nneedy peer would not know how to set about it. Needy peers have\ntried--half a dozen I have no doubt--and have failed, because they\nhave pretended that they were in love with her. It may be difficult,\nbut your only chance is to tell her the truth.\"\n\n\"And where shall I do it?\"\n\n\"Here if you choose; but her own house will be better.\"\n\n\"But I never can see her there--at least, not alone. I believe that\nshe never is alone. She always keeps a lot of people round her in\norder to stave off her lovers. Upon my word, Harriet, I think I'll\ngive it up. It is impossible that I should make such a declaration to\nher as that you propose.\"\n\n\"Faint heart, Nat--you know the rest.\"\n\n\"But the poet never alluded to such wooing as that you have\nsuggested. I suppose I had better begin with a schedule of my debts,\nand make reference, if she doubts me, to Fothergill, the sheriff's\nofficers, and the Tozer family.\"\n\n\"She will not doubt you, on that head; nor will she be a bit\nsurprised.\"\n\nThen there was again a pause, during which Mr. Sowerby still walked\nup and down the room, thinking whether or no he might possibly have\nany chance of success in so hazardous an enterprise.\n\n\"I tell you what, Harriet,\" at last he said; \"I wish you'd do it for\nme.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said she, \"if you really mean it, I will make the attempt.\"\n\n\"I am sure of this, that I shall never make it myself. I positively\nshould not have the courage to tell her in so many words, that I\nwanted to marry her for her money.\"\n\n\"Well, Nat, I will attempt it. At any rate, I am not afraid of her.\nShe and I are excellent friends, and, to tell the truth, I think I\nlike her better than any other woman that I know; but I never should\nhave been intimate with her, had it not been for your sake.\"\n\n\"And now you will have to quarrel with her, also for my sake?\"\n\n\"Not at all. You'll find that whether she accedes to my proposition\nor not, we shall continue friends. I do not think that she would die\nfor me--nor I for her. But as the world goes we suit each other. Such\na little trifle as this will not break our loves.\"\n\nAnd so it was settled. On the following day Mrs. Harold Smith was to\nfind an opportunity of explaining the whole matter to Miss Dunstable,\nand was to ask that lady to share her fortune--some incredible\nnumber of thousands of pounds--with the bankrupt member for West\nBarsetshire, who in return was to bestow on her--himself and his\ndebts.\n\nMrs. Harold Smith had spoken no more than the truth in saying that\nshe and Miss Dunstable suited one another. And she had not improperly\ndescribed their friendship. They were not prepared to die, one for\nthe sake of the other. They had said nothing to each other of mutual\nlove and affection. They never kissed, or cried, or made speeches,\nwhen they met or when they parted. There was no great benefit for\nwhich either had to be grateful to the other; no terrible injury\nwhich either had forgiven. But they suited each other; and this, I\ntake it, is the secret of most of our pleasantest intercourse in the\nworld.\n\nAnd it was almost grievous that they should suit each other, for\nMiss Dunstable was much the worthier of the two, had she but known\nit herself. It was almost to be lamented that she should have found\nherself able to live with Mrs. Harold Smith on terms that were\nperfectly satisfactory to herself. Mrs. Harold Smith was worldly,\nheartless--to all the world but her brother--and, as has been above\nhinted, almost dishonest. Miss Dunstable was not worldly, though it\nwas possible that her present style of life might make her so; she\nwas affectionate, fond of truth, and prone to honesty, if those\naround would but allow her to exercise it. But she was fond of ease\nand humour, sometimes of wit that might almost be called broad, and\nshe had a thorough love of ridiculing the world's humbugs. In all\nthese propensities Mrs. Harold Smith indulged her.\n\nUnder these circumstances they were now together almost every day.\nIt had become quite a habit with Mrs. Harold Smith to have herself\ndriven early in the forenoon to Miss Dunstable's house; and that\nlady, though she could never be found alone by Mr. Sowerby, was\nhabitually so found by his sister. And after that they would go out\ntogether, or each separately, as fancy or the business of the day\nmight direct them. Each was easy to the other in this alliance, and\nthey so managed that they never trod on each other's corns.\n\nOn the day following the agreement made between Mr. Sowerby and Mrs.\nHarold Smith, that lady as usual called on Miss Dunstable, and soon\nfound herself alone with her friend in a small room which the heiress\nkept solely for her own purposes. On special occasions persons of\nvarious sorts were there admitted; occasionally a parson who had a\nchurch to build, or a dowager laden with the last morsel of town\nslander, or a poor author who could not get due payment for the\nefforts of his brain, or a poor governess on whose feeble stamina the\nweight of the world had borne too hardly. But men who by possibility\ncould be lovers did not make their way thither, nor women who could\nbe bores. In these latter days, that is, during the present London\nseason, the doors of it had been oftener opened to Mrs. Harold Smith\nthan to any other person.\n\nAnd now the effort was to be made with the object of which all this\nintimacy had been effected. As she came thither in her carriage, Mrs.\nHarold Smith herself was not altogether devoid of that sinking of\nthe heart which is so frequently the forerunner of any difficult and\nhazardous undertaking. She had declared that she would feel no fear\nin making the little proposition. But she did feel something very\nlike it; and when she made her entrance into the little room she\ncertainly wished that the work was done and over.\n\n\"How is poor Mr. Smith to-day?\" asked Miss Dunstable, with an air\nof mock condolence, as her friend seated herself in her accustomed\neasy-chair. The downfall of the gods was as yet a history hardly\nthree days old, and it might well be supposed that the late lord of\nthe Petty Bag had hardly recovered from his misfortune.\n\n\"Well, he is better, I think, this morning; at least I should judge\nso from the manner in which he confronted his eggs. But still I don't\nlike the way he handles the carving-knife. I am sure he is always\nthinking of Mr. Supplehouse at those moments.\"\n\n\"Poor man! I mean Supplehouse. After all, why shouldn't he follow his\ntrade as well as another? Live and let live, that's what I say.\"\n\n\"Ay, but it's kill and let kill with him. That is what Horace says.\nHowever, I am tired of all that now, and I came here to-day to talk\nabout something else.\"\n\n\"I rather like Mr. Supplehouse myself,\" exclaimed Miss Dunstable. \"He\nnever makes any bones about the matter. He has a certain work to do,\nand a certain cause to serve--namely, his own; and in order to do\nthat work, and serve that cause, he uses such weapons as God has\nplaced in his hands.\"\n\n\"That's what the wild beasts do.\"\n\n\"And where will you find men honester than they? The tiger tears you\nup because he is hungry and wants to eat you. That's what Supplehouse\ndoes. But there are so many among us tearing up one another without\nany excuse of hunger. The mere pleasure of destroying is reason\nenough.\"\n\n\"Well, my dear, my mission to you to-day is certainly not one of\ndestruction, as you will admit when you hear it. It is one, rather,\nvery absolutely of salvation. I have come to make love to you.\"\n\n\"Then the salvation, I suppose, is not for myself,\" said Miss\nDunstable.\n\nIt was quite clear to Mrs. Harold Smith that Miss Dunstable had\nimmediately understood the whole purport of this visit, and that she\nwas not in any great measure surprised. It did not seem from the\ntone of the heiress's voice, or from the serious look which at once\nsettled on her face, that she would be prepared to give a very\nready compliance. But then great objects can only be won with great\nefforts.\n\n\"That's as may be,\" said Mrs. Harold Smith. \"For you and another\nalso, I hope. But I trust, at any rate, that I may not offend you?\"\n\n\"Oh, laws, no; nothing of that kind ever offends me now.\"\n\n\"Well, I suppose you're used to it.\"\n\n\"Like the eels, my dear. I don't mind it the least in the world--only\nsometimes, you know, it is a little tedious.\"\n\n\"I'll endeavour to avoid that, so I may as well break the ice at\nonce. You know enough of Nathaniel's affairs to be aware that he is\nnot a very rich man.\"\n\n\"Since you do ask me about it, I suppose there's no harm in saying\nthat I believe him to be a very poor man.\"\n\n\"Not the least harm in the world, but just the reverse. Whatever may\ncome of this, my wish is that the truth should be told scrupulously\non all sides; the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.\"\n\n\"_Magna est veritas_,\" said Miss Dunstable. \"The Bishop of Barchester\ntaught me as much Latin as that at Chaldicotes; and he did add some\nmore, but there was a long word, and I forgot it.\"\n\n\"The bishop was quite right, my dear, I'm sure. But if you go to your\nLatin, I'm lost. As we were just now saying, my brother's pecuniary\naffairs are in a very bad state. He has a beautiful property of\nhis own, which has been in the family for I can't say how many\ncenturies--long before the Conquest, I know.\"\n\n\"I wonder what my ancestors were then?\"\n\n\"It does not much signify to any of us,\" said Mrs. Harold Smith, with\na moral shake of her head, \"what our ancestors were; but it's a sad\nthing to see an old property go to ruin.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed; we none of us like to see our property going to ruin,\nwhether it be old or new. I have some of that sort of feeling\nalready, although mine was only made the other day out of an\napothecary's shop.\"\n\n\"God forbid that I should ever help you to ruin it,\" said Mrs. Harold\nSmith. \"I should be sorry to be the means of your losing a ten-pound\nnote.\"\n\n\"_Magna est veritas_, as the dear bishop said,\" exclaimed Miss\nDunstable. \"Let us have the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but\nthe truth, as we agreed just now.\"\n\nMrs. Harold Smith did begin to find that the task before her was\ndifficult. There was a hardness about Miss Dunstable when matters of\nbusiness were concerned on which it seemed almost impossible to make\nany impression. It was not that she had evinced any determination to\nrefuse the tender of Mr. Sowerby's hand; but she was so painfully\nresolute not to have dust thrown in her eyes! Mrs. Harold Smith had\ncommenced with a mind fixed upon avoiding what she called humbug;\nbut this sort of humbug had become so prominent a part of her usual\nrhetoric, that she found it very hard to abandon it.\n\n\"And that's what I wish,\" said she. \"Of course my chief object is to\nsecure my brother's happiness.\"\n\n\"That's very unkind to poor Mr. Harold Smith.\"\n\n\"Well, well, well--you know what I mean.\"\n\n\"Yes, I think I do know what you mean. Your brother is a gentleman of\ngood family, but of no means.\"\n\n\"Not quite so bad as that.\"\n\n\"Of embarrassed means, then, or anything that you will; whereas I am\na lady of no family, but of sufficient wealth. You think that if you\nbrought us together and made a match of it, it would be a very good\nthing for--for whom?\" said Miss Dunstable.\n\n\"Yes, exactly,\" said Mrs. Harold Smith.\n\n\"For which of us? Remember the bishop now and his nice little bit of\nLatin.\"\n\n\"For Nathaniel then,\" said Mrs. Harold Smith, boldly. \"It would be a\nvery good thing for him.\" And a slight smile came across her face as\nshe said it. \"Now that's honest, or the mischief is in it.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's honest enough. And did he send you here to tell me\nthis?\"\n\n\"Well, he did that, and something else.\"\n\n\"And now let's have the something else. The really important part, I\nhave no doubt, has been spoken.\"\n\n\"No, by no means, by no means all of it. But you are so hard on one,\nmy dear, with your running after honesty, that one is not able to\ntell the real facts as they are. You make one speak in such a bald,\nnaked way.\"\n\n\"Ah, you think that anything naked must be indecent; even truth.\"\n\n\"I think it is more proper-looking, and better suited, too, for the\nworld's work, when it goes about with some sort of a garment on\nit. We are so used to a leaven of falsehood in all we hear and say,\nnow-a-days, that nothing is more likely to deceive us than the\nabsolute truth. If a shopkeeper told me that his wares were simply\nmiddling, of course, I should think that they were not worth a\nfarthing. But all that has nothing to do with my poor brother. Well,\nwhat was I saying?\"\n\n\"You were going to tell me how well he would use me, no doubt.\"\n\n\"Something of that kind.\"\n\n\"That he wouldn't beat me; or spend all my money if I managed to have\nit tied up out of his power; or look down on me with contempt because\nmy father was an apothecary! Was not that what you were going to\nsay?\"\n\n\"I was going to tell you that you might be more happy as Mrs. Sowerby\nof Chaldicotes than you can be as Miss Dunstable--\"\n\n\"Of Mount Lebanon. And had Mr. Sowerby no other message to\nsend?--nothing about love, or anything of that sort? I should like,\nyou know, to understand what his feelings are before I take such a\nleap.\"\n\n\"I do believe he has as true a regard for you as any man of his age\never does have--\"\n\n\"For any woman of mine. That is not putting it in a very devoted\nway certainly; but I am glad to see that you remember the bishop's\nmaxim.\"\n\n\"What would you have me say? If I told you that he was dying for\nlove, you would say, I was trying to cheat you; and now because I\ndon't tell you so, you say that he is wanting in devotion. I must say\nyou are hard to please.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I am, and very unreasonable into the bargain. I ought to ask\nno questions of the kind when your brother proposes to do me so much\nhonour. As for my expecting the love of a man who condescends to wish\nto be my husband, that, of course, would be monstrous. What right can\nI have to think that any man should love me? It ought to be enough\nfor me to know that as I am rich, I can get a husband. What business\ncan such as I have to inquire whether the gentleman who would so\nhonour me really would like my company, or would only deign to put up\nwith my presence in his household?\"\n\n\"Now, my dear Miss Dunstable--\"\n\n\"Of course I am not such an ass as to expect that any gentleman\nshould love me; and I feel that I ought to be obliged to your brother\nfor sparing me the string of complimentary declarations which are\nusual on such occasions. He, at any rate, is not tedious--or rather\nyou on his behalf; for no doubt his own time is so occupied with his\nparliamentary duties that he cannot attend to this little matter\nhimself. I do feel grateful to him; and perhaps nothing more will be\nnecessary than to give him a schedule of the property, and name an\nearly day for putting him in possession.\"\n\nMrs. Smith did feel that she was rather badly used. This Miss\nDunstable, in their mutual confidences, had so often ridiculed the\nlove-making grimaces of her mercenary suitors--had spoken so fiercely\nagainst those who had persecuted her, not because they had desired\nher money, but on account of their ill-judgment in thinking her to\nbe a fool--that Mrs. Smith had a right to expect that the method\nshe had adopted for opening the negotiation would be taken in a\nbetter spirit. Could it be possible, after all, thought Mrs. Smith to\nherself, that Miss Dunstable was like other women, and that she did\nlike to have men kneeling at her feet? Could it be the case that she\nhad advised her brother badly, and that it would have been better for\nhim to have gone about his work in the old-fashioned way? \"They are\nvery hard to manage,\" said Mrs. Harold Smith to herself, thinking of\nher own sex.\n\n\"He was coming here himself,\" said she, \"but I advised him not to do\nso.\"\n\n\"That was so kind of you.\"\n\n\"I thought that I could explain to you more openly and more freely,\nwhat his intentions really are.\"\n\n\"Oh! I have no doubt that they are honourable,\" said Miss Dunstable.\n\"He does not want to deceive me in that way, I am quite sure.\"\n\nIt was impossible to help laughing, and Mrs. Harold Smith did laugh.\n\"Upon my word, you would provoke a saint,\" said she.\n\n\"I am not likely to get into any such company by the alliance that\nyou are now suggesting to me. There are not many saints usually at\nChaldicotes, I believe;--always excepting my dear bishop and his\nwife.\"\n\n\"But, my dear, what am I to say to Nathaniel?\"\n\n\"Tell him, of course, how much obliged to him I am.\"\n\n\"Do listen to me one moment. I daresay that I have done wrong to\nspeak to you in such a bold, unromantic way.\"\n\n\"Not at all. The truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.\nThat's what we agreed upon. But one's first efforts in any line are\nalways apt to be a little uncouth.\"\n\n\"I will send Nathaniel to you himself.\"\n\n\"No, do not do so. Why torment either him or me? I do like\nyour brother; in a certain way I like him much. But no earthly\nconsideration would induce me to marry him. Is it not so glaringly\nplain that he would marry me for my money only, that you have not\neven dared to suggest any other reason?\"\n\n\"Of course it would have been nonsense to say that he had no regard\nwhatever towards your money.\"\n\n\"Of course it would--absolute nonsense. He is a poor man with a good\nposition, and he wants to marry me because I have got that which\nhe wants. But, my dear, I do not want that which he has got, and\ntherefore the bargain would not be a fair one.\"\n\n\"But he would do his very best to make you happy.\"\n\n\"I am so much obliged to him; but you see, I am very happy as I am.\nWhat should I gain?\"\n\n\"A companion whom you confess that you like.\"\n\n\"Ah! but I don't know that I should like too much even of such a\ncompanion as your brother. No, my dear--it won't do. Believe me when\nI tell you, once for all, that it won't do.\"\n\n\"Do you mean, then, Miss Dunstable, that you'll never marry?\"\n\n\"To-morrow--if I met any one that I fancied, and he would have me.\nBut I rather think that any that I may fancy won't have me. In the\nfirst place, if I marry any one, the man must be quite indifferent to\nmoney.\"\n\n\"Then you'll not find him in this world, my dear.\"\n\n\"Very possibly not,\" said Miss Dunstable.\n\nAll that was further said upon the subject need not be here repeated.\nMrs. Harold Smith did not give up her cause quite at once, although\nMiss Dunstable had spoken so plainly. She tried to explain how\neligible would be her friend's situation as mistress of Chaldicotes,\nwhen Chaldicotes should owe no penny to any man: and went so far\nas to hint that the master of Chaldicotes, if relieved of his\nembarrassments and known as a rich man, might in all probability be\nfound worthy of a peerage when the gods should return to Olympus. Mr.\nHarold Smith, as a cabinet minister, would, of course, do his best.\nBut it was all of no use. \"It's not my destiny,\" said Miss Dunstable,\n\"and therefore do not press it any longer.\"\n\n\"But we shall not quarrel,\" said Mrs. Harold Smith, almost tenderly.\n\n\"Oh, no--why should we quarrel?\"\n\n\"And you won't look glum at my brother?\"\n\n\"Why should I look glum at him? But, Mrs. Smith, I'll do more than\nnot looking glum at him. I do like you, and I do like your brother,\nand if I can in any moderate way assist him in his difficulties, let\nhim tell me so.\"\n\nSoon after this, Mrs. Harold Smith went her way. Of course, she\ndeclared in a very strong manner that her brother could not think of\naccepting from Miss Dunstable any such pecuniary assistance as that\noffered--and, to give her her due, such was the feeling of her mind\nat the moment; but as she went to meet her brother and gave him an\naccount of this interview, it did occur to her that possibly Miss\nDunstable might be a better creditor than the Duke of Omnium for the\nChaldicotes property.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\nNON-IMPULSIVE.\n\n\nIt cannot be held as astonishing, that that last decision on the\npart of the giants in the matter of the two bishoprics should\nhave disgusted Archdeacon Grantly. He was a politician, but not a\npolitician as they were. As is the case with all exoteric men, his\npolitical eyes saw a short way only, and his political aspirations\nwere as limited. When his friends came into office, that bishop bill,\nwhich as the original product of his enemies had been regarded by\nhim as being so pernicious--for was it not about to be made law in\norder that other Proudies and such like might be hoisted up into\nhigh places and large incomes, to the terrible detriment of the\nChurch?--that bishop bill, I say, in the hands of his friends, had\nappeared to him to be a means of almost national salvation. And then,\nhow great had been the good fortune of the giants in this matter! Had\nthey been the originators of such a measure they would not have had\na chance of success; but now--now that the two bishops were falling\ninto their mouths out of the weak hands of the gods, was not their\nsuccess ensured? So Dr. Grantly had girded up his loins and marched\nup to the fight, almost regretting that the triumph would be so easy.\nThe subsequent failure was very trying to his temper as a party man.\n\nIt always strikes me that the supporters of the Titans are in this\nrespect much to be pitied. The giants themselves, those who are\nactually handling Pelion and breaking their shins over the lower\nrocks of Ossa, are always advancing in some sort towards the councils\nof Olympus. Their highest policy is to snatch some ray from heaven.\nWhy else put Pelion on Ossa, unless it be that a furtive hand, making\nits way through Jove's windows, may pluck forth a thunderbolt or two,\nor some article less destructive, but of manufacture equally divine?\nAnd in this consists the wisdom of the higher giants--that, in spite\nof their mundane antecedents, theories, and predilections, they can\nsee that articles of divine manufacture are necessary. But then\nthey never carry their supporters with them. Their whole army is an\narmy of martyrs. \"For twenty years I have stuck to them, and see\nhow they have treated me!\" Is not that always the plaint of an old\ngiant-slave? \"I have been true to my party all my life, and where am\nI now?\" he says. Where, indeed, my friend? Looking about you, you\nbegin to learn that you cannot describe your whereabouts. I do not\nmarvel at that. No one finds himself planted at last in so terribly\nfoul a morass, as he would fain stand still for ever on dry ground.\n\nDr. Grantly was disgusted; and although he was himself too true and\nthorough in all his feelings, to be able to say aloud that any Giant\nwas wrong, still he had a sad feeling within his heart that the world\nwas sinking from under him. He was still sufficiently exoteric to\nthink that a good stand-up fight in a good cause was a good thing.\nNo doubt he did wish to be Bishop of Westminster, and was anxious to\ncompass that preferment by any means that might appear to him to be\nfair. And why not? But this was not the end of his aspirations. He\nwished that the giants might prevail in everything, in bishoprics as\nin all other matters; and he could not understand that they should\ngive way on the very first appearance of a skirmish. In his open talk\nhe was loud against many a god; but in his heart of hearts he was\nbitter enough against both Porphyrion and Orion.\n\n\"My dear doctor, it would not do;--not in this session; it would not\nindeed.\" So had spoken to him a half-fledged but especially esoteric\nyoung monster-cub at the Treasury, who considered himself as up to\nall the dodges of his party, and regarded the army of martyrs who\nsupported it as a rather heavy, but very useful collection of fogeys.\nDr. Grantly had not cared to discuss the matter with the half-fledged\nmonster-cub. The best licked of all the monsters, the Giant most like\na god of them all, had said a word or two to him; and he also had\nsaid a word or two to that Giant. Porphyrion had told him that the\nbishop bill would not do; and he, in return, speaking with warm face,\nand blood in his cheeks, had told Porphyrion that he saw no reason\nwhy the bill should not do. The courteous Giant had smiled as he\nshook his ponderous head, and then the archdeacon had left him,\nunconsciously shaking some dust from his shoes, as he paced the\npassages of the Treasury chambers for the last time. As he walked\nback to his lodgings in Mount Street, many thoughts, not altogether\nbad in their nature, passed through his mind. Why should he trouble\nhimself about a bishopric? Was he not well as he was, in his rectory\ndown at Plumstead? Might it not be ill for him at his age to\ntransplant himself into new soil, to engage in new duties, and live\namong new people? Was he not useful at Barchester, and respected\nalso; and might it not be possible, that up there at Westminster, he\nmight be regarded merely as a tool with which other men could work?\nHe had not quite liked the tone of that specially esoteric young\nmonster-cub, who had clearly regarded him as a distinguished fogey\nfrom the army of martyrs. He would take his wife back to Barsetshire,\nand there live contented with the good things which Providence had\ngiven him.\n\nThose high political grapes had become sour, my sneering friends will\nsay. Well? Is it not a good thing that grapes should become sour\nwhich hang out of reach? Is he not wise who can regard all grapes as\nsour which are manifestly too high for his hand? Those grapes of the\nTreasury bench, for which gods and giants fight, suffering so much\nwhen they are forced to abstain from eating, and so much more when\nthey do eat,--those grapes are very sour to me. I am sure that they\nare indigestible, and that those who eat them undergo all the ills\nwhich the Revalenta Arabica is prepared to cure. And so it was now\nwith the archdeacon. He thought of the strain which would have been\nput on his conscience had he come up there to sit in London as Bishop\nof Westminster; and in this frame of mind he walked home to his wife.\n\nDuring the first few moments of his interview with her all his\nregrets had come back upon him. Indeed, it would have hardly suited\nfor him then to have preached this new doctrine of rural contentment.\nThe wife of his bosom, whom he so fully trusted--had so fully\nloved--wished for grapes that hung high upon the wall, and he knew\nthat it was past his power to teach her at the moment to drop her\nambition. Any teaching that he might effect in that way, must come\nby degrees. But before many minutes were over he had told her of\nher fate and of his own decision. \"So we had better go back to\nPlumstead,\" he said; and she had not dissented.\n\n\"I am sorry for poor Griselda's sake,\" Mrs. Grantly had remarked\nlater in the evening, when they were again together.\n\n\"But I thought she was to remain with Lady Lufton?\"\n\n\"Well; so she will, for a little time. There is no one with whom I\nwould so soon trust her out of my own care as with Lady Lufton. She\nis all that one can desire.\"\n\n\"Exactly; and as far as Griselda is concerned, I cannot say that I\nthink she is to be pitied.\"\n\n\"Not to be pitied, perhaps,\" said Mrs. Grantly. \"But, you see,\narchdeacon, Lady Lufton, of course, has her own views.\"\n\n\"Her own views?\"\n\n\"It is hardly any secret that she is very anxious to make a match\nbetween Lord Lufton and Griselda. And though that might be a very\nproper arrangement if it were fixed--\"\n\n\"Lord Lufton marry Griselda!\" said the archdeacon, speaking quick and\nraising his eyebrows. His mind had as yet been troubled by but few\nthoughts respecting his child's future establishment. \"I had never\ndreamt of such a thing.\"\n\n\"But other people have done more than dream of it, archdeacon. As\nregards the match itself, it would, I think, be unobjectionable. Lord\nLufton will not be a very rich man, but his property is respectable,\nand as far as I can learn his character is on the whole good. If they\nlike each other, I should be contented with such a marriage. But,\nI must own, I am not quite satisfied at the idea of leaving her all\nalone with Lady Lufton. People will look on it as a settled thing,\nwhen it is not settled--and very probably may not be settled; and\nthat will do the poor girl harm. She is very much admired; there can\nbe no doubt of that; and Lord Dumbello--\"\n\nThe archdeacon opened his eyes still wider. He had had no idea that\nsuch a choice of sons-in-law was being prepared for him; and, to\ntell the truth, was almost bewildered by the height of his wife's\nambition. Lord Lufton, with his barony and twenty thousand a year,\nmight be accepted as just good enough; but failing him there was an\nembryo marquis, whose fortune would be more than ten times as great,\nall ready to accept his child! And then he thought, as husbands\nsometimes will think, of Susan Harding as she was when he had gone\na-courting to her under the elms before the house in the warden's\ngarden at Barchester, and of dear old Mr. Harding, his wife's father,\nwho still lived in humble lodgings in that city; and as he thought,\nhe wondered at and admired the greatness of that lady's mind.\n\n\"I never can forgive Lord De Terrier,\" said the lady, connecting\nvarious points together in her own mind.\n\n\"That's nonsense,\" said the archdeacon. \"You must forgive him.\"\n\n\"And I must confess that it annoys me to leave London at present.\"\n\n\"It can't be helped,\" said the archdeacon, somewhat gruffly; for he\nwas a man who, on certain points, chose to have his own way--and had\nit.\n\n\"Oh, no: I know it can't be helped,\" said Mrs. Grantly, in a tone\nwhich implied a deep injury. \"I know it can't be helped. Poor\nGriselda!\" And then they went to bed.\n\nOn the next morning Griselda came to her, and in an interview that\nwas strictly private, her mother said more to her than she had ever\nyet spoken, as to the prospects of her future life. Hitherto, on this\nsubject, Mrs. Grantly had said little or nothing. She would have been\nwell pleased that her daughter should have received the incense of\nLord Lufton's vows--or, perhaps, as well pleased had it been the\nincense of Lord Dumbello's vows--without any interference on her\npart. In such case her child, she knew, would have told her with\nquite sufficient eagerness, and the matter in either case would have\nbeen arranged as a very pretty love match. She had no fear of any\nimpropriety or of any rashness on Griselda's part. She had thoroughly\nknown her daughter when she boasted that Griselda would never indulge\nin an unauthorized passion. But as matters now stood, with those two\nstrings to her bow, and with that Lufton-Grantly alliance treaty\nin existence--of which she, Griselda herself, knew nothing--might\nit not be possible that the poor child should stumble through want\nof adequate direction? Guided by these thoughts, Mrs. Grantly had\nresolved to say a few words before she left London. So she wrote\na line to her daughter, and Griselda reached Mount Street at two\no'clock in Lady Lufton's carriage, which, during the interview,\nwaited for her at the beer-shop round the corner.\n\n\"And papa won't be Bishop of Westminster?\" said the young lady, when\nthe doings of the giants had been sufficiently explained to make her\nunderstand that all those hopes were over.\n\n\"No, my dear; at any rate not now.\"\n\n\"What a shame! I thought it was all settled. What's the good, mamma,\nof Lord De Terrier being prime minister, if he can't make whom he\nlikes a bishop?\"\n\n\"I don't think that Lord De Terrier has behaved at all well to your\nfather. However, that's a long question, and we can't go into it\nnow.\"\n\n\"How glad those Proudies will be!\"\n\nGriselda would have talked by the hour on this subject had her mother\nallowed her, but it was necessary that Mrs. Grantly should go to\nother matters. She began about Lady Lufton, saying what a dear woman\nher ladyship was; and then went on to say that Griselda was to remain\nin London as long as it suited her friend and hostess to stay there\nwith her; but added, that this might probably not be very long, as it\nwas notorious that Lady Lufton, when in London, was always in a hurry\nto get back to Framley.\n\n\"But I don't think she is in such a hurry this year, mamma,\" said\nGriselda, who in the month of May preferred Bruton Street to\nPlumstead, and had no objection whatever to the coronet on the panels\nof Lady Lufton's coach.\n\nAnd then Mrs. Grantly commenced her explanation--very cautiously.\n\"No, my dear, I daresay she is not in such a hurry this year,--that\nis, as long as you remain with her.\"\n\n\"I am sure she is very kind.\"\n\n\"She is very kind, and you ought to love her very much. I know I do.\nI have no friend in the world for whom I have a greater regard than\nfor Lady Lufton. It is that which makes me so happy to leave you with\nher.\"\n\n\"All the same, I wish that you and papa had remained up; that is, if\nthey had made papa a bishop.\"\n\n\"It's no good thinking of that now, my dear. What I particularly\nwanted to say to you was this: I think you should know what are the\nideas which Lady Lufton entertains.\"\n\n\"Her ideas!\" said Griselda, who had never troubled herself much in\nthinking about other people's thoughts.\n\n\"Yes, Griselda. While you were staying down at Framley Court, and\nalso, I suppose, since you have been up here in Bruton Street, you\nmust have seen a good deal of--Lord Lufton.\"\n\n\"He doesn't come very often to Bruton Street,--that is to say, not\n_very_ often.\"\n\n\"H-m,\" ejaculated Mrs. Grantly, very gently. She would willingly have\nrepressed the sound altogether, but it had been too much for her. If\nshe found reason to think that Lady Lufton was playing her false, she\nwould immediately take her daughter away, break up the treaty, and\nprepare for the Hartletop alliance. Such were the thoughts that ran\nthrough her mind. But she knew all the while that Lady Lufton was not\nfalse. The fault was not with Lady Lufton; nor, perhaps, altogether\nwith Lord Lufton. Mrs. Grantly had understood the full force of the\ncomplaint which Lady Lufton had made against her daughter; and though\nshe had of course defended her child, and on the whole had defended\nher successfully, yet she confessed to herself that Griselda's chance\nof a first-rate establishment would be better if she were a little\nmore impulsive. A man does not wish to marry a statue, let the\nstatue be ever so statuesque. She could not teach her daughter to be\nimpulsive, any more than she could teach her to be six feet high; but\nmight it not be possible to teach her to seem so? The task was a very\ndelicate one, even for a mother's hand.\n\n\"Of course he cannot be at home now as much as he was down in the\ncountry, when he was living in the same house,\" said Mrs. Grantly,\nwhose business it was to take Lord Lufton's part at the present\nmoment. \"He must be at his club, and at the House of Lords, and in\ntwenty places.\"\n\n\"He is very fond of going to parties, and he dances beautifully.\"\n\n\"I am sure he does. I have seen as much as that myself, and I think\nI know some one with whom he likes to dance.\" And the mother gave her\ndaughter a loving little squeeze.\n\n\"Do you mean me, mamma?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do mean you, my dear. And is it not true? Lady Lufton says\nthat he likes dancing with you better than with any one else in\nLondon.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Griselda, looking down upon the ground.\n\nMrs. Grantly thought that this upon the whole was rather a good\nopening. It might have been better. Some point of interest more\nserious in its nature than that of a waltz might have been found on\nwhich to connect her daughter's sympathies with those of her future\nhusband. But any point of interest was better than none; and it is so\ndifficult to find points of interest in persons who by their nature\nare not impulsive.\n\n\"Lady Lufton says so, at any rate,\" continued Mrs. Grantly, ever so\ncautiously. \"She thinks that Lord Lufton likes no partner better.\nWhat do you think yourself, Griselda?\"\n\n\"I don't know, mamma.\"\n\n\"But young ladies must think of such things, must they not?\"\n\n\"Must they, mamma?\"\n\n\"I suppose they do, don't they? The truth is, Griselda, that Lady\nLufton thinks that if-- Can you guess what it is she thinks?\"\n\n\"No, mamma.\" But that was a fib on Griselda's part.\n\n\"She thinks that my Griselda would make the best possible wife in the\nworld for her son; and I think so too. I think that her son will be\na very fortunate man if he can get such a wife. And now what do you\nthink, Griselda?\"\n\n\"I don't think anything, mamma.\"\n\nBut that would not do. It was absolutely necessary that she should\nthink, and absolutely necessary that her mother should tell her so.\nSuch a degree of unimpulsiveness as this would lead to--heaven knows\nwhat results! Lufton-Grantly treaties and Hartletop interests would\nbe all thrown away upon a young lady who would not think anything of\na noble suitor sighing for her smiles. Besides, it was not natural.\nGriselda, as her mother knew, had never been a girl of headlong\nfeeling; but still she had had her likes and her dislikes. In that\nmatter of the bishopric she was keen enough; and no one could evince\na deeper interest in the subject of a well-made new dress than\nGriselda Grantly. It was not possible that she should be indifferent\nas to her future prospects, and she must know that those prospects\ndepended mainly on her marriage. Her mother was almost angry with\nher, but nevertheless she went on very gently:\n\n\"You don't think anything! But, my darling, you must think. You must\nmake up your mind what would be your answer if Lord Lufton were to\npropose to you. That is what Lady Lufton wishes him to do.\"\n\n\"But he never will, mamma.\"\n\n\"And if he did?\"\n\n\"But I'm sure he never will. He doesn't think of such a thing at\nall--and--and--\"\n\n\"And what, my dear?\"\n\n\"I don't know, mamma.\"\n\n\"Surely you can speak out to me, dearest! All I care about is your\nhappiness. Both Lady Lufton and I think that it would be a happy\nmarriage if you both cared for each other enough. She thinks that\nhe is fond of you. But if he were ten times Lord Lufton I would not\ntease you about it if I thought that you could not learn to care\nabout him. What was it you were going to say, my dear?\"\n\n\"Lord Lufton thinks a great deal more of Lucy Robarts than he does\nof--of--of any one else, I believe,\" said Griselda, showing now some\nlittle animation by her manner, \"dumpy little black thing that she\nis.\"\n\n\"Lucy Robarts!\" said Mrs. Grantly, taken by surprise at finding that\nher daughter was moved by such a passion as jealousy, and feeling\nalso perfectly assured that there could not be any possible ground\nfor jealousy in such a direction as that. \"Lucy Robarts, my dear! I\ndon't suppose Lord Lufton ever thought of speaking to her, except in\nthe way of civility.\"\n\n\"Yes, he did, mamma! Don't you remember at Framley?\"\n\nMrs. Grantly began to look back in her mind, and she thought she\ndid remember having once observed Lord Lufton talking in rather a\nconfidential manner with the parson's sister. But she was sure that\nthere was nothing in it. If that was the reason why Griselda was so\ncold to her proposed lover, it would be a thousand pities that it\nshould not be removed.\n\n\"Now you mention her, I do remember the young lady,\" said Mrs.\nGrantly, \"a dark girl, very low, and without much figure. She seemed\nto me to keep very much in the background.\"\n\n\"I don't know much about that, mamma.\"\n\n\"As far as I saw her, she did. But, my dear Griselda, you should not\nallow yourself to think of such a thing. Lord Lufton, of course, is\nbound to be civil to any young lady in his mother's house, and I am\nquite sure that he has no other idea whatever with regard to Miss\nRobarts. I certainly cannot speak as to her intellect, for I do not\nthink she opened her mouth in my presence; but--\"\n\n\"Oh! she has plenty to say for herself, when she pleases. She's a sly\nlittle thing.\"\n\n\"But, at any rate, my dear, she has no personal attractions whatever,\nand I do not at all think that Lord Lufton is a man to be taken\nby--by--by anything that Miss Robarts might do or say.\"\n\nAs those words \"personal attractions\" were uttered, Griselda managed\nso to turn her neck as to catch a side view of herself in one of the\nmirrors on the wall, and then she bridled herself up, and made a\nlittle play with her eyes, and looked, as her mother thought, very\nwell. \"It is all nothing to me, mamma, of course,\" she said.\n\n\"Well, my dear, perhaps not. I don't say that it is. I do not wish to\nput the slightest constraint upon your feelings. If I did not have\nthe most thorough dependence on your good sense and high principles,\nI should not speak to you in this way. But as I have, I thought it\nbest to tell you that both Lady Lufton and I should be well pleased\nif we thought that you and Lord Lufton were fond of each other.\"\n\n\"I am sure he never thinks of such a thing, mamma.\"\n\n\"And as for Lucy Robarts, pray get that idea out of your head; if not\nfor your sake, then for his. You should give him credit for better\ntaste.\"\n\nBut it was not so easy to take anything out of Griselda's head that\nshe had once taken into it. \"As for tastes, mamma, there is no\naccounting for them,\" she said; and then the colloquy on that subject\nwas over. The result of it on Mrs. Grantly's mind was a feeling\namounting almost to a conviction in favour of the Dumbello interest.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\nIMPULSIVE.\n\n\nI trust my readers will all remember how Puck the pony was beaten\nduring that drive to Hogglestock. It may be presumed that Puck\nhimself on that occasion did not suffer much. His skin was not so\nsoft as Mrs. Robarts's heart. The little beast was full of oats and\nall the good things of this world, and therefore, when the whip\ntouched him, he would dance about and shake his little ears, and run\non at a tremendous pace for twenty yards, making his mistress think\nthat he had endured terrible things. But, in truth, during those\nwhippings Puck was not the chief sufferer.\n\nLucy had been forced to declare--forced by the strength of her own\nfeelings, and by the impossibility of assenting to the propriety of a\nmarriage between Lord Lufton and Miss Grantly--, she had been forced\nto declare that she did care about Lord Lufton as much as though\nhe were her brother. She had said all this to herself,--nay, much\nmore than this--very often. But now she had said it out loud to her\nsister-in-law; and she knew that what she had said was remembered,\nconsidered, and had, to a certain extent, become the cause of\naltered conduct. Fanny alluded very seldom to the Luftons in casual\nconversation, and never spoke about Lord Lufton, unless when her\nhusband made it impossible that she should not speak of him. Lucy had\nattempted on more than one occasion to remedy this, by talking about\nthe young lord in a laughing and, perhaps, half-jeering way; she\nhad been sarcastic as to his hunting and shooting, and had boldly\nattempted to say a word in joke about his love for Griselda. But she\nfelt that she had failed; that she had failed altogether as regarded\nFanny; and that as to her brother, she would more probably be the\nmeans of opening his eyes, than have any effect in keeping them\nclosed. So she gave up her efforts and spoke no further word about\nLord Lufton. Her secret had been told, and she knew that it had been\ntold.\n\nAt this time the two ladies were left a great deal alone together in\nthe drawing-room at the parsonage; more, perhaps, than had ever yet\nbeen the case since Lucy had been there. Lady Lufton was away, and\ntherefore the almost daily visit to Framley Court was not made; and\nMark in these days was a great deal at Barchester, having, no doubt,\nvery onerous duties to perform before he could be admitted as one of\nthat chapter. He went into, what he was pleased to call residence,\nalmost at once. That is, he took his month of preaching, aiding also\nin some slight and very dignified way, in the general Sunday morning\nservices. He did not exactly live at Barchester, because the house\nwas not ready. That at least was the assumed reason. The chattels of\nDr. Stanhope, the late prebendary, had not been as yet removed, and\nthere was likely to be some little delay, creditors asserting their\nright to them. This might have been very inconvenient to a gentleman\nanxiously expecting the excellent house which the liberality of past\nages had provided for his use; but it was not so felt by Mr. Robarts.\nIf Dr. Stanhope's family or creditors would keep the house for the\nnext twelve months, he would be well pleased. And by this arrangement\nhe was enabled to get through his first month of absence from the\nchurch of Framley without any notice from Lady Lufton, seeing that\nLady Lufton was in London all the time. This also was convenient,\nand taught our young prebendary to look on his new preferment more\nfavourably than he had hitherto done.\n\nFanny and Lucy were thus left much alone: and as out of the full\nhead the mouth speaks, so is the full heart more prone to speak at\nsuch periods of confidence as these. Lucy, when she first thought\nof her own state, determined to endow herself with a powerful gift\nof reticence. She would never tell her love, certainly; but neither\nwould she let concealment feed on her damask cheek, nor would she\never be found for a moment sitting like Patience on a monument. She\nwould fight her own fight bravely within her own bosom, and conquer\nher enemy altogether. She would either preach, or starve, or weary\nher love into subjection, and no one should be a bit the wiser. She\nwould teach herself to shake hands with Lord Lufton without a quiver,\nand would be prepared to like his wife amazingly--unless indeed that\nwife should be Griselda Grantly. Such were her resolutions; but at\nthe end of the first week they were broken into shivers and scattered\nto the winds.\n\nThey had been sitting in the house together the whole of one wet day;\nand as Mark was to dine in Barchester with the dean, they had had\ndinner early, eating with the children almost in their laps. It is\nso that ladies do, when their husbands leave them to themselves. It\nwas getting dusk towards evening, and they were still sitting in the\ndrawing-room, the children now having retired, when Mrs. Robarts for\nthe fifth time since her visit to Hogglestock began to express her\nwish that she could do some good to the Crawleys,--to Grace Crawley\nin particular, who, standing up there at her father's elbow, learning\nGreek irregular verbs, had appeared to Mrs. Robarts to be an especial\nobject of pity.\n\n\"I don't know how to set about it,\" said Mrs. Robarts.\n\nNow any allusion to that visit to Hogglestock always drove Lucy's\nmind back to the consideration of the subject which had most occupied\nit at the time. She at such moments remembered how she had beaten\nPuck, and how in her half-bantering but still too serious manner\nshe had apologized for doing so, and had explained the reason. And\ntherefore she could not interest herself about Grace Crawley as\nvividly as she should have done.\n\n\"No; one never does,\" she said.\n\n\"I was thinking about it all that day as I drove home,\" said Fanny.\n\"The difficulty is this: What can we do with her?\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Lucy, remembering the very point of the road at which\nshe had declared that she did like Lord Lufton very much.\n\n\"If we could have her here for a month or so and then send her to\nschool;--but I know Mr. Crawley would not allow us to pay for her\nschooling.\"\n\n\"I don't think he would,\" said Lucy, with her thoughts far removed\nfrom Mr. Crawley and his daughter Grace.\n\n\"And then we should not know what to do with her; should we?\"\n\n\"No; you would not.\"\n\n\"It would never do to have the poor girl about the house here, with\nno one to teach her anything. Mark would not teach her Greek verbs,\nyou know.\"\n\n\"I suppose not.\"\n\n\"Lucy, you are not attending to a word I say to you, and I don't\nthink you have for the last hour. I don't believe you know what I am\ntalking about.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I do--Grace Crawley; I'll try and teach her if you like,\nonly I don't know anything myself.\"\n\n\"That's not what I mean at all, and you know I would not ask you to\ntake such a task as that on yourself. But I do think you might talk\nit over with me.\"\n\n\"Might I? very well; I will. What is it? Oh, Grace Crawley--you\nwant to know who is to teach her the irregular Greek verbs. Oh dear,\nFanny, my head does ache so: pray don't be angry with me.\" And then\nLucy, throwing herself back on the sofa, put one hand up painfully to\nher forehead, and altogether gave up the battle.\n\nMrs. Robarts was by her side in a moment. \"Dearest Lucy, what is\nit makes your head ache so often now? you used not to have those\nheadaches.\"\n\n\"It's because I'm growing stupid: never mind. We will go on about\npoor Grace. It would not do to have a governess, would it?\"\n\n\"I can see that you are not well, Lucy,\" said Mrs. Robarts, with a\nlook of deep concern. \"What is it, dearest? I can see that something\nis the matter.\"\n\n\"Something the matter! No, there's not; nothing worth talking of.\nSometimes I think I'll go back to Devonshire and live there. I could\nstay with Blanche for a time, and then get a lodging in Exeter.\"\n\n\"Go back to Devonshire!\" and Mrs. Robarts looked as though she\nthought that her sister-in-law was going mad. \"Why do you want to go\naway from us? This is to be your own, own home, always now.\"\n\n\"Is it? Then I am in a bad way. Oh dear, oh dear, what a fool I am!\nWhat an idiot I've been! Fanny, I don't think I can stay here; and I\ndo so wish I'd never come. I do--I do--I do, though you look at me so\nhorribly,\" and jumping up she threw herself into her sister-in-law's\narms and began kissing her violently. \"Don't pretend to be wounded,\nfor you know that I love you. You know that I could live with you all\nmy life, and think you were perfect--as you are; but--\"\n\n\"Has Mark said anything?\"\n\n\"Not a word,--not a ghost of a syllable. It is not Mark; oh, Fanny!\"\n\n\"I am afraid I know what you mean,\" said Mrs. Robarts in a low\ntremulous voice, and with deep sorrow painted on her face.\n\n\"Of course you do; of course you know; you have known it all along:\nsince that day in the pony-carriage. I knew that you knew it. You do\nnot dare to mention his name: would not that tell me that you know\nit? And I, I am hypocrite enough for Mark; but my hypocrisy won't\npass muster before you. And, now, had I not better go to Devonshire?\"\n\n\"Dearest, dearest Lucy.\"\n\n\"Was I not right about that labelling? O heavens! what idiots we\ngirls are! That a dozen soft words should have bowled me over like a\nninepin, and left me without an inch of ground to call my own. And\nI was so proud of my own strength; so sure that I should never be\nmissish, and spoony, and sentimental! I was so determined to like him\nas Mark does, or you--\"\n\n\"I shall not like him at all if he has spoken words to you that he\nshould not have spoken.\"\n\n\"But he has not.\" And then she stopped a moment to consider. \"No, he\nhas not. He never said a word to me that would make you angry with\nhim if you knew of it. Except, perhaps, that he called me Lucy; and\nthat was my fault, not his.\"\n\n\"Because you talked of soft words.\"\n\n\"Fanny, you have no idea what an absolute fool I am, what an\nunutterable ass. The soft words of which I tell you were of the kind\nwhich he speaks to you when he asks you how the cow gets on which he\nsent you from Ireland, or to Mark about Ponto's shoulder. He told me\nthat he knew papa, and that he was at school with Mark, and that as\nhe was such good friends with you here at the parsonage, he must be\ngood friends with me too. No; it has not been his fault. The soft\nwords which did the mischief were such as those. But how well his\nmother understood the world! In order to have been safe, I should not\nhave dared to look at him.\"\n\n\"But, dearest Lucy--\"\n\n\"I know what you are going to say, and I admit it all. He is no hero.\nThere is nothing on earth wonderful about him. I never heard him say\na single word of wisdom, or utter a thought that was akin to poetry.\nHe devotes all his energies to riding after a fox or killing poor\nbirds, and I never heard of his doing a single great action in my\nlife. And yet--\"\n\nFanny was so astounded by the way her sister-in-law went on, that she\nhardly knew how to speak. \"He is an excellent son, I believe,\" at\nlast she said.\n\n\"Except when he goes to Gatherum Castle. I'll tell you what he has:\nhe has fine straight legs, and a smooth forehead, and a good-humoured\neye, and white teeth. Was it possible to see such a catalogue of\nperfections, and not fall down, stricken to the very bone? But it was\nnot that that did it all, Fanny. I could have stood against that. I\nthink I could at least. It was his title that killed me. I had never\nspoken to a lord before. Oh, me! what a fool, what a beast I have\nbeen!\" And then she burst out into tears.\n\nMrs. Robarts, to tell the truth, could hardly understand poor Lucy's\nailment. It was evident enough that her misery was real; but yet she\nspoke of herself and her sufferings with so much irony, with so near\nan approach to joking, that it was very hard to tell how far she was\nin earnest. Lucy, too, was so much given to a species of badinage\nwhich Mrs. Robarts did not always quite understand, that the latter\nwas afraid sometimes to speak out what came uppermost to her tongue.\nBut now that Lucy was absolutely in tears, and was almost breathless\nwith excitement, she could not remain silent any longer. \"Dearest\nLucy, pray do not speak in that way; it will all come right. Things\nalways do come right when no one has acted wrongly.\"\n\n\"Yes, when nobody has done wrongly. That's what papa used to call\nbegging the question. But I'll tell you what, Fanny; I will not be\nbeaten. I will either kill myself or get through it. I am so heartily\nself-ashamed that I owe it to myself to fight the battle out.\"\n\n\"To fight what battle, dearest?\"\n\n\"This battle. Here, now, at the present moment, I could not meet Lord\nLufton. I should have to run like a scared fowl if he were to show\nhimself within the gate; and I should not dare to go out of the\nhouse, if I knew that he was in the parish.\"\n\n\"I don't see that, for I am sure you have not betrayed yourself.\"\n\n\"Well, no; as for myself, I believe I have done the lying and the\nhypocrisy pretty well. But, dearest Fanny, you don't know half; and\nyou cannot and must not know.\"\n\n\"But I thought you said there had been nothing whatever between you.\"\n\n\"Did I? Well, to you I have not said a word that was not true. I said\nthat he had spoken nothing that it was wrong for him to say. It could\nnot be wrong--. But never mind. I'll tell you what I mean to do. I\nhave been thinking of it for the last week--only I shall have to tell\nMark.\"\n\n\"If I were you I would tell him all.\"\n\n\"What, Mark! If you do, Fanny, I'll never, never, never speak to you\nagain. Would you--when I have given you all my heart in true sisterly\nlove?\"\n\nMrs. Robarts had to explain that she had not proposed to tell\nanything to Mark herself, and was persuaded, moreover, to give a\nsolemn promise that she would not tell anything to him unless\nspecially authorized to do so.\n\n\"I'll go into a home, I think,\" continued Lucy. \"You know what those\nhomes are?\" Mrs. Robarts assured her that she knew very well, and\nthen Lucy went on: \"A year ago I should have said that I was the last\ngirl in England to think of such a life, but I do believe now that it\nwould be the best thing for me. And then I'll starve myself, and flog\nmyself, and in that way I'll get back my own mind and my own soul.\"\n\n\"Your own soul, Lucy!\" said Mrs. Robarts, in a tone of horror.\n\n\"Well, my own heart, if you like it better; but I hate to hear myself\ntalking about hearts. I don't care for my heart. I'd let it go--with\nthis young popinjay lord or anyone else, so that I could read, and\ntalk, and walk, and sleep, and eat, without always feeling that I was\nwrong here--here--here,\" and she pressed her hand vehemently against\nher side. \"What is it that I feel, Fanny? Why am I so weak in body\nthat I cannot take exercise? Why cannot I keep my mind on a book for\none moment? Why can I not write two sentences together? Why should\nevery mouthful that I eat stick in my throat? Oh, Fanny, is it his\nlegs, think you, or is it his title?\"\n\nThrough all her sorrow,--and she was very sorrowful,--Mrs. Robarts\ncould not help smiling. And, indeed, there was every now and then\nsomething even in Lucy's look that was almost comic. She acted the\nirony so well with which she strove to throw ridicule on herself! \"Do\nlaugh at me,\" she said. \"Nothing on earth will do me so much good as\nthat; nothing, unless it be starvation and a whip. If you would only\ntell me that I must be a sneak and an idiot to care for a man because\nhe is good-looking and a lord!\"\n\n\"But that has not been the reason. There is a great deal more in Lord\nLufton than that; and since I must speak, dear Lucy, I cannot but say\nthat I should not wonder at your being in love with him, only--only\nthat--\"\n\n\"Only what? Come, out with it. Do not mince matters, or think that I\nshall be angry with you because you scold me.\"\n\n\"Only that I should have thought that you would have been too guarded\nto have--have cared for any gentleman till--till he had shown that he\ncared for you.\"\n\n\"Guarded! Yes, that's it; that's just the word. But it's he that\nshould have been guarded. He should have had a fire-guard hung before\nhim--or a love-guard, if you will. Guarded! Was I not guarded, till\nyou all would drag me out? Did I want to go there? And when I was\nthere, did I not make a fool of myself, sitting in a corner, and\nthinking how much better placed I should have been down in the\nservants' hall. Lady Lufton--she dragged me out, and then cautioned\nme, and then, then-- Why is Lady Lufton to have it all her own way?\nWhy am I to be sacrificed for her? I did not want to know Lady\nLufton, or any one belonging to her.\"\n\n\"I cannot think that you have any cause to blame Lady Lufton, nor,\nperhaps, to blame anybody very much.\"\n\n\"Well, no, it has been all my own fault; though for the life of me,\nFanny, going back and back, I cannot see where I took the first false\nstep. I do not know where I went wrong. One wrong thing I did, and it\nis the only thing that I do not regret.\"\n\n\"What was that, Lucy?\"\n\n\"I told him a lie.\"\n\nMrs. Robarts was altogether in the dark, and feeling that she was\nso, she knew that she could not give counsel as a friend or a sister.\nLucy had begun by declaring--so Mrs. Robarts thought--that nothing\nhad passed between her and Lord Lufton but words of most trivial\nimport, and yet she now accused herself of falsehood, and declared\nthat that falsehood was the only thing which she did not regret!\n\n\"I hope not,\" said Mrs. Robarts. \"If you did, you were very unlike\nyourself.\"\n\n\"But I did, and were he here again, speaking to me in the same way,\nI should repeat it. I know I should. If I did not, I should have\nall the world on me. You would frown on me, and be cold. My darling\nFanny, how would you look if I really displeasured you?\"\n\n\"I don't think you will do that, Lucy.\"\n\n\"But if I told him the truth I should, should I not? Speak now. But\nno, Fanny, you need not speak. It was not the fear of you; no, nor\neven of her: though Heaven knows that her terrible glumness would be\nquite unendurable.\"\n\n\"I cannot understand you, Lucy. What truth or what untruth can you\nhave told him if, as you say, there has been nothing between you but\nordinary conversation?\"\n\nLucy then got up from the sofa, and walked twice the length of the\nroom before she spoke. Mrs. Robarts had all the ordinary curiosity--I\nwas going to say, of a woman, but I mean to say, of humanity; and she\nhad, moreover, all the love of a sister. She was both curious and\nanxious, and remained sitting where she was, silent, and with her\neyes fixed on her companion.\n\n\"Did I say so?\" Lucy said at last. \"No, Fanny; you have mistaken me:\nI did not say that. Ah, yes, about the cow and the dog. All that was\ntrue. I was telling you of what his soft words had been while I was\nbecoming such a fool. Since that he has said more.\"\n\n\"What more has he said, Lucy?\"\n\n\"I yearn to tell you, if only I can trust you;\" and Lucy knelt down\nat the feet of Mrs. Robarts, looking up into her face and smiling\nthrough the remaining drops of her tears. \"I would fain tell you,\nbut I do not know you yet,--whether you are quite true. I could be\ntrue,--true against all the world, if my friend told me. I will\ntell you, Fanny, if you say that you can be true. But if you doubt\nyourself, if you must whisper all to Mark--then let us be silent.\"\n\nThere was something almost awful in this to Mrs. Robarts. Hitherto,\nsince their marriage, hardly a thought had passed through her mind\nwhich she had not shared with her husband. But now all this had come\nupon her so suddenly, that she was unable to think whether it would\nbe well that she should become the depositary of such a secret,--not\nto be mentioned to Lucy's brother, not to be mentioned to her own\nhusband. But who ever yet was offered a secret and declined it? Who\nat least ever declined a love secret? What sister could do so? Mrs.\nRobarts therefore gave the promise, smoothing Lucy's hair as she did\nso, and kissing her forehead and looking into her eyes, which, like\na rainbow, were the brighter for her tears. \"And what has he said to\nyou, Lucy?\"\n\n\"What? Only this, that he asked me to be his wife.\"\n\n\"Lord Lufton proposed to you?\"\n\n\"Yes; proposed to me. It is not credible, is it? You cannot bring\nyourself to believe that such a thing happened, can you?\" And Lucy\nrose again to her feet, as the idea of the scorn with which she\nfelt that others would treat her--with which she herself treated\nherself--made the blood rise to her cheek. \"And yet it is not a\ndream. I think that it is not a dream. I think that he really did.\"\n\n\"Think, Lucy!\"\n\n\"Well, I may say that I am sure.\"\n\n\"A gentleman would not make you a formal proposal, and leave you in\ndoubt as to what he meant.\"\n\n\"Oh dear, no. There was no doubt at all of that kind; none in the\nleast. Mr. Smith in asking Miss Jones to do him the honour of\nbecoming Mrs. Smith never spoke more plainly. I was alluding to the\npossibility of having dreamt it all.\"\n\n\"Lucy!\"\n\n\"Well, it was not a dream. Here, standing here, on this very spot--on\nthat flower of the carpet--he begged me a dozen times to be his wife.\nI wonder whether you and Mark would let me cut it out and keep it.\"\n\n\"And what answer did you make to him?\"\n\n\"I lied to him and told him that I did not love him.\"\n\n\"You refused him?\"\n\n\"Yes; I refused a live lord. There is some satisfaction in having\nthat to think of, is there not? Fanny, was I wicked to tell that\nfalsehood?\"\n\n\"And why did you refuse him?\"\n\n\"Why? Can you ask? Think what it would have been to go down to\nFramley Court, and to tell her ladyship in the course of conversation\nthat I was engaged to her son. Think of Lady Lufton. But yet it was\nnot that, Fanny. Had I thought that it was good for him, that he\nwould not have repented, I would have braved anything--for his sake.\nEven your frown, for you would have frowned. You would have thought\nit sacrilege for me to marry Lord Lufton! You know you would.\"\n\nMrs. Robarts hardly knew how to say what she thought, or indeed what\nshe ought to think. It was a matter on which much meditation would be\nrequired before she could give advice, and there was Lucy expecting\ncounsel from her at that very moment. If Lord Lufton really loved\nLucy Robarts, and was loved by Lucy Robarts, why should not they two\nbecome man and wife? And yet she did feel that it would be--perhaps\nnot sacrilege, as Lucy had said, but something almost as troublesome.\nWhat would Lady Lufton say, or think, or feel? What would she say,\nand think, and feel as to that parsonage from which so deadly a blow\nwould fall upon her? Would she not accuse the vicar and the vicar's\nwife of the blackest ingratitude? Would life be endurable at Framley\nunder such circumstances as those?\n\n\"What you tell me so surprises me, that I hardly as yet know how to\nspeak about it,\" said Mrs. Robarts.\n\n\"It was amazing, was it not? He must have been insane at the time;\nthere can be no other excuse made for him. I wonder whether there is\nanything of that sort in the family?\"\n\n\"What; madness?\" said Mrs. Robarts, quite in earnest.\n\n\"Well, don't you think he must have been mad when such an idea as\nthat came into his head? But you don't believe it; I can see that.\nAnd yet it is as true as heaven. Standing exactly here, on this spot,\nhe said that he would persevere till I accepted his love. I wonder\nwhat made me specially observe that both his feet were within the\nlines of that division.\"\n\n\"And you would not accept his love?\"\n\n\"No; I would have nothing to say to it. Look you, I stood here, and\nputting my hand upon my heart,--for he bade me to do that,--I said\nthat I could not love him.\"\n\n\"And what then?\"\n\n\"He went away,--with a look as though he were heart-broken. He crept\naway slowly, saying that he was the most wretched soul alive. For a\nminute I believed him, and could almost have called him back. But,\nno, Fanny; do not think that I am over proud, or conceited about my\nconquest. He had not reached the gate before he was thanking God for\nhis escape.\"\n\n\"That I do not believe.\"\n\n\"But I do; and I thought of Lady Lufton too. How could I bear that\nshe should scorn me, and accuse me of stealing her son's heart? I\nknow that it is better as it is; but tell me--is a falsehood always\nwrong, or can it be possible that the end should justify the means?\nOught I to have told him the truth, and to have let him know that I\ncould almost kiss the ground on which he stood?\"\n\nThis was a question for the doctors which Mrs. Robarts would not take\nupon herself to answer. She would not make that falsehood matter of\naccusation, but neither would she pronounce for it any absolution. In\nthat matter Lucy must regulate her own conscience. \"And what shall\nI do next?\" said Lucy, still speaking in a tone that was half tragic\nand half jeering.\n\n\"Do?\" said Mrs. Robarts.\n\n\"Yes, something must be done. If I were a man I should go to\nSwitzerland, of course; or, as the case is a bad one, perhaps as far\nas Hungary. What is it that girls do? they don't die now-a-days, I\nbelieve.\"\n\n\"Lucy, I do not believe that you care for him one jot. If you were in\nlove you would not speak of it like that.\"\n\n\"There, there. That's my only hope. If I could laugh at myself till\nit had become incredible to you, I also, by degrees, should cease to\nbelieve that I had cared for him. But, Fanny, it is very hard. If\nI were to starve, and rise before daybreak, and pinch myself, or do\nsome nasty work,--clean the pots and pans and the candlesticks; that\nI think would do the most good. I have got a piece of sack-cloth, and\nI mean to wear that, when I have made it up.\"\n\n\"You are joking now, Lucy, I know.\"\n\n\"No, by my word; not in the spirit of what I am saying. How shall\nI act upon my heart, if I do not do it through the blood and the\nflesh?\"\n\n\"Do you not pray that God will give you strength to bear these\ntroubles?\"\n\n\"But how is one to word one's prayer, or how even to word one's\nwishes? I do not know what is the wrong that I have done. I say it\nboldly; in this matter I cannot see my own fault. I have simply found\nthat I have been a fool.\"\n\nIt was now quite dark in the room, or would have been so to any one\nentering it afresh. They had remained there talking till their eyes\nhad become accustomed to the gloom, and would still have remained,\nhad they not suddenly been disturbed by the sound of a horse's feet.\n\n\"There is Mark,\" said Fanny, jumping up and running to the bell, that\nlights might be ready when he should enter.\n\n\"I thought he remained in Barchester to-night.\"\n\n\"And so did I; but he said it might be doubtful. What shall we do if\nhe has not dined?\"\n\nThat, I believe, is always the first thought in the mind of a good\nwife when her husband returns home. Has he had his dinner? What can\nI give him for dinner? Will he like his dinner? Oh dear, oh dear!\nthere is nothing in the house but cold mutton. But on this occasion\nthe lord of the mansion had dined, and came home radiant with\ngood-humour, and owing, perhaps, a little of his radiance to the\ndean's claret. \"I have told them,\" said he, \"that they may keep\npossession of the house for the next two months, and they have agreed\nto that arrangement.\"\n\n\"That is very pleasant,\" said Mrs. Robarts.\n\n\"And I don't think we shall have so much trouble about the\ndilapidations after all.\"\n\n\"I am very glad of that,\" said Mrs. Robarts. But nevertheless she was\nthinking much more of Lucy than of the house in Barchester Close.\n\n\"You won't betray me,\" said Lucy, as she gave her sister-in-law a\nparting kiss at night.\n\n\"No; not unless you give me permission.\"\n\n\"Ah; I shall never do that.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.\n\nSOUTH AUDLEY STREET.\n\n\nThe Duke of Omnium had notified to Mr. Fothergill his wish that some\narrangement should be made about the Chaldicotes mortgages, and Mr.\nFothergill had understood what the duke meant as well as though his\ninstructions had been written down with all a lawyer's verbosity.\nThe duke's meaning was this, that Chaldicotes was to be swept up\nand garnered, and made part and parcel of the Gatherum property. It\nhad seemed to the duke that that affair between his friend and Miss\nDunstable was hanging fire, and, therefore, it would be well that\nChaldicotes should be swept up and garnered. And, moreover, tidings\nhad come into the western division of the county that young Frank\nGresham of Boxall Hill was in treaty with the Government for the\npurchase of all that Crown property called the Chace of Chaldicotes.\nIt had been offered to the duke, but the duke had given no definite\nanswer. Had he got his money back from Mr. Sowerby, he could have\nforestalled Mr. Gresham; but now that did not seem to be probable,\nand his grace was resolved that either the one property or the other\nshould be duly garnered. Therefore Mr. Fothergill went up to town,\nand therefore Mr. Sowerby was, most unwillingly, compelled to have a\nbusiness interview with Mr. Fothergill. In the meantime, since last\nwe saw him, Mr. Sowerby had learned from his sister the answer which\nMiss Dunstable had given to his proposition, and knew that he had no\nfurther hope in that direction.\n\nThere was no further hope thence of absolute deliverance, but there\nhad been a tender of money services. To give Mr. Sowerby his due,\nhe had at once declared that it would be quite out of the question\nthat he should now receive any assistance of that sort from Miss\nDunstable; but his sister had explained to him that it would be a\nmere business transaction; that Miss Dunstable would receive her\ninterest; and that, if she would be content with four per cent.,\nwhereas the duke received five, and other creditors six, seven,\neight, ten, and heaven only knows how much more, it might be well for\nall parties. He, himself, understood, as well as Fothergill had done,\nwhat was the meaning of the duke's message. Chaldicotes was to be\ngathered up and garnered, as had been done with so many another fair\nproperty lying in those regions. It was to be swallowed whole, and\nthe master was to walk out from his old family hall, to leave the\nold woods that he loved, to give up utterly to another the parks and\npaddocks and pleasant places which he had known from his earliest\ninfancy, and owned from his earliest manhood.\n\nThere can be nothing more bitter to a man than such a surrender.\nWhat, compared to this, can be the loss of wealth to one who has\nhimself made it, and brought it together, but has never actually seen\nit with his bodily eyes? Such wealth has come by one chance, and\ngoes by another: the loss of it is part of the game which the man is\nplaying; and if he cannot lose as well as win, he is a poor, weak,\ncowardly creature. Such men, as a rule, do know how to bear a mind\nfairly equal to adversity. But to have squandered the acres which\nhave descended from generation to generation; to be the member of\none's family that has ruined that family; to have swallowed up in\none's own maw all that should have graced one's children, and one's\ngrandchildren! It seems to me that the misfortunes of this world can\nhardly go beyond that!\n\nMr. Sowerby, in spite of his recklessness and that dare-devil gaiety\nwhich he knew so well how to wear and use, felt all this as keenly\nas any man could feel it. It had been absolutely his own fault. The\nacres had come to him all his own, and now, before his death, every\none of them would have gone bodily into that greedy maw. The duke\nhad bought up nearly all the debts which had been secured upon the\nproperty, and now could make a clean sweep of it. Sowerby, when he\nreceived that message from Mr. Fothergill, knew well that this was\nintended; and he knew well also, that when once he should cease to be\nMr. Sowerby of Chaldicotes, he need never again hope to be returned\nas member for West Barsetshire. This world would for him be all over.\nAnd what must such a man feel when he reflects that this world is for\nhim all over?\n\nOn the morning in question he went to his appointment, still bearing\na cheerful countenance. Mr. Fothergill, when in town on such business\nas this, always had a room at his service in the house of Messrs.\nGumption and Gagebee, the duke's London law agents, and it was\nthither that Mr. Sowerby had been summoned. The house of business of\nMessrs. Gumption and Gagebee was in South Audley Street; and it may\nbe said that there was no spot on the whole earth which Mr. Sowerby\nso hated as he did the gloomy, dingy back sitting-room up-stairs\nin that house. He had been there very often, but had never been\nthere without annoyance. It was a horrid torture-chamber, kept for\nsuch dread purposes as these, and no doubt had been furnished, and\npapered, and curtained with the express object of finally breaking\ndown the spirits of such poor country gentlemen as chanced to be\ninvolved. Everything was of a brown crimson,--of a crimson that had\nbecome brown. Sunlight, real genial light of the sun, never made its\nway there, and no amount of candles could illumine the gloom of that\nbrownness. The windows were never washed; the ceiling was of a dark\nbrown; the old Turkey carpet was thick with dust, and brown withal.\nThe ungainly office-table, in the middle of the room, had been\ncovered with black leather, but that was now brown. There was a\nbookcase full of dingy brown law books in a recess on one side of\nthe fireplace, but no one had touched them for years, and over the\nchimney-piece hung some old legal pedigree table, black with soot.\nSuch was the room which Mr. Fothergill always used in the business\nhouse of Messrs. Gumption and Gagebee, in South Audley Street, near\nto Park Lane.\n\nI once heard this room spoken of by an old friend of mine, one\nMr. Gresham of Greshamsbury, the father of Frank Gresham, who was\nnow about to purchase that part of the Chace of Chaldicotes which\nbelonged to the Crown. He also had had evil days, though now happily\nthey were past and gone; and he, too, had sat in that room, and\nlistened to the voice of men who were powerful over his property,\nand intended to use that power. The idea which he left on my mind\nwas much the same as that which I had entertained, when a boy, of\na certain room in the castle of Udolpho. There was a chair in that\nUdolpho room in which those who sat were dragged out limb by limb,\nthe head one way and the legs another; the fingers were dragged off\nfrom the hands, and the teeth out from the jaws, and the hair off\nthe head, and the flesh from the bones, and the joints from their\nsockets, till there was nothing left but a lifeless trunk seated in\nthe chair. Mr. Gresham, as he told me, always sat in the same seat,\nand the tortures he suffered when so seated, the dislocations of his\nproperty which he was forced to discuss, the operations on his very\nself which he was forced to witness, made me regard that room as\nworse than the chamber of Udolpho. He, luckily--a rare instance of\ngood fortune--had lived to see all his bones and joints put together\nagain, and flourishing soundly; but he never could speak of the room\nwithout horror.\n\n\"No consideration on earth,\" he once said to me, very solemnly,--\"I\nsay none, should make me again enter that room.\" And indeed this\nfeeling was so strong with him, that from the day when his affairs\ntook a turn he would never even walk down South Audley Street. On\nthe morning in question into this torture-chamber Mr. Sowerby went,\nand there, after some two or three minutes, he was joined by Mr.\nFothergill.\n\nMr. Fothergill was, in one respect, like to his friend Sowerby. He\nenacted two altogether different persons on occasions which were\naltogether different. Generally speaking, with the world at large, he\nwas a jolly, rollicking, popular man, fond of eating and drinking,\nknown to be devoted to the duke's interests, and supposed to be\nsomewhat unscrupulous, or at any rate hard, when they were concerned;\nbut in other respects a good-natured fellow; and there was a report\nabout that he had once lent somebody money, without charging him\ninterest or taking security. On the present occasion Sowerby saw\nat a glance that he had come thither with all the aptitudes and\nappurtenances of his business about him. He walked into the room with\na short, quick step; there was no smile on his face as he shook hands\nwith his old friend; he brought with him a box laden with papers and\nparchments, and he had not been a minute in the room before he was\nseated in one of the old dingy chairs.\n\n\"How long have you been in town, Fothergill?\" said Sowerby, still\nstanding with his back against the chimney. He had resolved on only\none thing--that nothing should induce him to touch, look at, or\nlisten to any of those papers. He knew well enough that no good would\ncome of that. He also had his own lawyer, to see that he was pilfered\naccording to rule.\n\n\"How long? Since the day before yesterday. I never was so busy in my\nlife. The duke, as usual, wants to have everything done at once.\"\n\n\"If he wants to have all that I owe him paid at once, he is like to\nbe out in his reckoning.\"\n\n\"Ah, well; I'm glad you are ready to come quickly to business,\nbecause it's always best. Won't you come and sit down here?\"\n\n\"No, thank you; I'll stand.\"\n\n\"But we shall have to go through these figures, you know.\"\n\n\"Not a figure, Fothergill. What good would it do? None to me, and\nnone to you either, as I take it; if there is anything wrong,\nPotter's fellows will find it out. What is it the duke wants?\"\n\n\"Well; to tell the truth, he wants his money.\"\n\n\"In one sense, and that the main sense, he has got it. He gets his\ninterest regularly, does not he?\"\n\n\"Pretty well for that, seeing how times are. But, Sowerby, that's\nnonsense. You understand the duke as well as I do, and you know very\nwell what he wants. He has given you time, and if you had taken any\nsteps towards getting the money, you might have saved the property.\"\n\n\"A hundred and eighty thousand pounds! What steps could I take to\nget that? Fly a bill, and let Tozer have it to get cash on it in the\nCity!\"\n\n\"We hoped you were going to marry.\"\n\n\"That's all off.\"\n\n\"Then I don't think you can blame the duke for looking for his own.\nIt does not suit him to have so large a sum standing out any longer.\nYou see, he wants land, and will have it. Had you paid off what you\nowed him, he would have purchased the Crown property; and now, it\nseems, young Gresham has bid against him, and is to have it. This has\nriled him, and I may as well tell you fairly, that he is determined\nto have either money or marbles.\"\n\n\"You mean that I am to be dispossessed.\"\n\n\"Well, yes; if you choose to call it so. My instructions are to\nforeclose at once.\"\n\n\"Then I must say the duke is treating me most uncommonly ill.\"\n\n\"Well, Sowerby, I can't see it.\"\n\n\"I can, though. He has his money like clock-work; and he has bought\nup these debts from persons who would have never disturbed me as long\nas they got their interest.\"\n\n\"Haven't you had the seat?\"\n\n\"The seat! and is it expected that I am to pay for that?\"\n\n\"I don't see that any one is asking you to pay for it. You are like\na great many other people that I know. You want to eat your cake and\nhave it. You have been eating it for the last twenty years, and now\nyou think yourself very ill-used because the duke wants to have his\nturn.\"\n\n\"I shall think myself very ill-used if he sells me out--worse than\nill-used. I do not want to use strong language, but it will be more\nthan ill-usage. I can hardly believe that he really means to treat me\nin that way.\"\n\n\"It is very hard that he should want his own money!\"\n\n\"It is not his money that he wants. It is my property.\"\n\n\"And has he not paid for it? Have you not had the price of your\nproperty? Now, Sowerby, it is of no use for you to be angry; you have\nknown for the last three years what was coming on you as well as I\ndid. Why should the duke lend you money without an object? Of course\nhe has his own views. But I do say this; he has not hurried you; and\nhad you been able to do anything to save the place you might have\ndone it. You have had time enough to look about you.\"\n\nSowerby still stood in the place in which he had first fixed himself,\nand now for awhile he remained silent. His face was very stern, and\nthere was in his countenance none of those winning looks which often\ntold so powerfully with his young friends,--which had caught Lord\nLufton and had charmed Mark Robarts. The world was going against him,\nand things around him were coming to an end. He was beginning to\nperceive that he had in truth eaten his cake, and that there was now\nlittle left for him to do,--unless he chose to blow out his brains.\nHe had said to Lord Lufton that a man's back should be broad enough\nfor any burden with which he himself might load it. Could he now\nboast that his back was broad enough and strong enough for this\nburden? But he had even then, at that bitter moment, a strong\nremembrance that it behoved him still to be a man. His final ruin was\ncoming on him, and he would soon be swept away out of the knowledge\nand memory of those with whom he had lived. But, nevertheless, he\nwould bear himself well to the last. It was true that he had made his\nown bed, and he understood the justice which required him to lie upon\nit.\n\nDuring all this time Fothergill occupied himself with the papers.\nHe continued to turn over one sheet after another, as though he\nwere deeply engaged in money considerations and calculations. But,\nin truth, during all that time he did not read a word. There was\nnothing there for him to read. The reading and the writing, and the\narithmetic in such matters, are done by underlings--not by such big\nmen as Mr. Fothergill. His business was to tell Sowerby that he was\nto go. All those records there were of very little use. The duke had\nthe power; Sowerby knew that the duke had the power; and Fothergill's\nbusiness was to explain that the duke meant to exercise his power.\nHe was used to the work, and went on turning over the papers and\npretending to read them, as though his doing so were of the greatest\nmoment.\n\n\"I shall see the duke myself,\" Mr. Sowerby said at last, and there\nwas something almost dreadful in the sound of his voice.\n\n\"You know that the duke won't see you on a matter of this kind. He\nnever speaks to anyone about money; you know that as well as I do.\"\n\n\"By ----, but he shall speak to me. Never speak to anyone about\nmoney! Why is he ashamed to speak of it when he loves it so dearly?\nHe shall see me.\"\n\n\"I have nothing further to say, Sowerby. Of course I shan't ask his\ngrace to see you; and if you force your way in on him you know what\nwill happen. It won't be my doing if he is set against you. Nothing\nthat you say to me in that way,--nothing that anybody ever\nsays,--goes beyond myself.\"\n\n\"I shall manage the matter through my own lawyer,\" said Sowerby; and\nthen he took his hat, and, without uttering another word, left the\nroom.\n\nWe know not what may be the nature of that eternal punishment to\nwhich those will be doomed who shall be judged to have been evil at\nthe last; but methinks that no more terrible torment can be devised\nthan the memory of self-imposed ruin. What wretchedness can exceed\nthat of remembering from day to day that the race has been all run,\nand has been altogether lost; that the last chance has gone, and has\ngone in vain; that the end has come, and with it disgrace, contempt,\nand self-scorn--disgrace that never can be redeemed, contempt that\nnever can be removed, and self-scorn that will eat into one's vitals\nfor ever?\n\nMr. Sowerby was now fifty; he had enjoyed his chances in life; and as\nhe walked back, up South Audley Street, he could not but think of the\nuses he had made of them. He had fallen into the possession of a fine\nproperty on the attainment of his manhood; he had been endowed with\nmore than average gifts of intellect; never-failing health had been\ngiven to him, and a vision fairly clear in discerning good from evil;\nand now to what a pass had he brought himself!\n\nAnd that man Fothergill had put all this before him in so terribly\nclear a light! Now that the day for his final demolishment had\narrived, the necessity that he should be demolished--finished away at\nonce, out of sight and out of mind--had not been softened, or, as it\nwere, half hidden, by any ambiguous phrase. \"You have had your cake,\nand eaten it--eaten it greedily. Is not that sufficient for you?\nWould you eat your cake twice? Would you have a succession of cakes?\nNo, my friend; there is no succession of these cakes for those who\neat them greedily. Your proposition is not a fair one, and we who\nhave the whip-hand of you will not listen to it. Be good enough to\nvanish. Permit yourself to be swept quietly into the dunghill. All\nthat there was about you of value has departed from you; and allow me\nto say that you are now--rubbish.\" And then the ruthless besom comes\nwith irresistible rush, and the rubbish is swept into the pit, there\nto be hidden for ever from the sight.\n\nAnd the pity of it is this--that a man, if he will only restrain\nhis greed, may eat his cake and yet have it; ay, and in so doing\nwill have twice more the flavour of the cake than he who with\ngourmandizing maw will devour his dainty all at once. Cakes in this\nworld will grow by being fed on, if only the feeder be not too\ninsatiate. On all which wisdom Mr. Sowerby pondered with sad heart\nand very melancholy mind as he walked away from the premises of\nMessrs. Gumption and Gagebee.\n\nHis intention had been to go down to the House after leaving Mr.\nFothergill, but the prospect of immediate ruin had been too much for\nhim, and he knew that he was not fit to be seen at once among the\nhaunts of men. And he had intended also to go down to Barchester\nearly on the following morning--only for a few hours, that he might\nmake further arrangements respecting that bill which Robarts had\naccepted for him. That bill--the second one--had now become due, and\nMr. Tozer had been with him.\n\n\"Now it ain't no use in life, Mr. Sowerby,\" Tozer had said. \"I ain't\ngot the paper myself, nor didn't 'old it, not two hours. It went away\nthrough Tom Tozer; you knows that, Mr. Sowerby, as well as I do.\"\n\nNow, whenever Tozer, Mr. Sowerby's Tozer, spoke of Tom Tozer, Mr.\nSowerby knew that seven devils were being evoked, each worse than\nthe first devil. Mr. Sowerby did feel something like sincere regard,\nor rather love, for that poor parson whom he had inveigled into\nmischief, and would fain save him, if it were possible, from the\nTozer fang. Mr. Forrest, of the Barchester bank, would probably take\nup that last five hundred pound bill, on behalf of Mr. Robarts,--only\nit would be needful that he, Sowerby, should run down and see that\nthis was properly done. As to the other bill--the former and lesser\none--as to that, Mr. Tozer would probably be quiet for a while.\n\nSuch had been Sowerby's programme for these two days; but now--what\nfurther possibility was there now that he should care for Robarts,\nor any other human being; he that was to be swept at once into the\ndung-heap?\n\nIn this frame of mind he walked up South Audley Street, and crossed\none side of Grosvenor Square, and went almost mechanically into Green\nStreet. At the farther end of Green Street, near to Park Lane, lived\nMr. and Mrs. Harold Smith.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\n\nDR. THORNE.\n\n\nWhen Miss Dunstable met her friends, the Greshams--young Frank\nGresham and his wife--at Gatherum Castle, she immediately asked after\none Dr. Thorne, who was Mrs. Gresham's uncle. Dr. Thorne was an old\nbachelor, in whom both as a man and a doctor Miss Dunstable was\ninclined to place much confidence. Not that she had ever entrusted\nthe cure of her bodily ailments to Dr. Thorne--for she kept a doctor\nof her own, Dr. Easyman, for this purpose--and it may moreover be\nsaid that she rarely had bodily ailments requiring the care of any\ndoctor. But she always spoke of Dr. Thorne among her friends as a man\nof wonderful erudition and judgment; and had once or twice asked and\nacted on his advice in matters of much moment. Dr. Thorne was not\na man accustomed to the London world; he kept no house there, and\nseldom even visited the metropolis; but Miss Dunstable had known him\nat Greshamsbury, where he lived, and there had for some months past\ngrown up a considerable intimacy between them. He was now staying at\nthe house of his niece, Mrs. Gresham; but the chief reason of his\ncoming up had been a desire expressed by Miss Dunstable, that he\nshould do so. She had wished for his advice; and at the instigation\nof his niece he had visited London and given it.\n\nThe special piece of business as to which Dr. Thorne had thus been\nsummoned from the bedsides of his country patients, and especially\nfrom the bedside of Lady Arabella Gresham, to whose son his niece was\nmarried, related to certain large money interests, as to which one\nmight have imagined that Dr. Thorne's advice would not be peculiarly\nvaluable. He had never been much versed in such matters on his own\naccount, and was knowing neither in the ways of the share market, nor\nin the prices of land. But Miss Dunstable was a lady accustomed to\nhave her own way, and to be indulged in her own wishes without being\ncalled on to give adequate reasons for them.\n\n\"My dear,\" she had said to young Mrs. Gresham, \"if your uncle don't\ncome up to London now, when I make such a point of it, I shall think\nthat he is a bear and a savage; and I certainly will never speak to\nhim again,--or to Frank--or to you; so you had better see to it.\"\nMrs. Gresham had not probably taken her friend's threat as meaning\nquite all that it threatened. Miss Dunstable habitually used strong\nlanguage; and those who knew her well, generally understood when\nshe was to be taken as expressing her thoughts by figures of speech.\nIn this instance she had not meant it all; but, nevertheless, Mrs.\nGresham had used violent influence in bringing the poor doctor up to\nLondon.\n\n\"Besides,\" said Miss Dunstable, \"I have resolved on having the doctor\nat my conversazione, and if he won't come of himself, I shall go down\nand fetch him. I have set my heart on trumping my dear friend Mrs.\nProudie's best card; so I mean to get everybody!\"\n\nThe upshot of all this was, that the doctor did come up to town, and\nremained the best part of a week at his niece's house in Portman\nSquare--to the great disgust of the Lady Arabella, who conceived\nthat she must die if neglected for three days. As to the matter\nof business, I have no doubt but that he was of great use. He\nwas possessed of common sense and an honest purpose; and I am\ninclined to think that they are often a sufficient counterpoise to\na considerable amount of worldly experience. If one could have the\nworldly experience also--! True! but then it is so difficult to get\neverything. But with that special matter of business we need not\nhave any further concern. We will presume it to have been discussed\nand completed, and will now dress ourselves for Miss Dunstable's\nconversazione.\n\nBut it must not be supposed that she was so poor in genius as to call\nher party openly by a name borrowed for the nonce from Mrs. Proudie.\nIt was only among her specially intimate friends, Mrs. Harold Smith\nand some few dozen others, that she indulged in this little joke.\nThere had been nothing in the least pretentious about the card with\nwhich she summoned her friends to her house on this occasion. She\nhad merely signified in some ordinary way, that she would be glad to\nsee them as soon after nine o'clock on Thursday evening, the ----\ninstant, as might be convenient. But all the world understood that\nall the world was to be gathered together at Miss Dunstable's house\non the night in question,--that an effort was to be made to bring\ntogether people of all classes, gods and giants, saints and sinners,\nthose rabid through the strength of their morality, such as our\ndear friend Lady Lufton, and those who were rabid in the opposite\ndirection, such as Lady Hartletop, the Duke of Omnium, and Mr.\nSowerby. An orthodox martyr had been caught from the East, and an\noily latter-day St. Paul from the other side of the water--to the\nhorror and amazement of Archdeacon Grantly, who had come up all the\nway from Plumstead to be present on the occasion. Mrs. Grantly also\nhad hankered to be there; but when she heard of the presence of the\nlatter-day St. Paul, she triumphed loudly over her husband, who had\nmade no offer to take her. That Lords Brock and De Terrier were to\nbe at the gathering was nothing. The pleasant king of the gods and\nthe courtly chief of the giants could shake hands with each other\nin any house with the greatest pleasure; but men were to meet who,\nin reference to each other, could shake nothing but their heads or\ntheir fists. Supplehouse was to be there, and Harold Smith, who now\nhated his enemy with a hatred surpassing that of women--or even\nof politicians. The minor gods, it was thought, would congregate\ntogether in one room, very bitter in their present state of\nbanishment; and the minor giants in another, terribly loud in\ntheir triumph. That is the fault of the giants, who, otherwise,\nare not bad fellows; they are unable to endure the weight of any\ntemporary success. When attempting Olympus--and this work of\nattempting is doubtless their natural condition--they scratch and\nscramble, diligently using both toes and fingers, with a mixture\nof good-humoured virulence and self-satisfied industry that\nis gratifying to all parties. But whenever their efforts are\nunexpectedly, and for themselves unfortunately successful, they are\nso taken aback that they lose the power of behaving themselves with\neven gigantesque propriety.\n\nSuch, so great and so various, was to be the intended gathering\nat Miss Dunstable's house. She herself laughed, and quizzed\nherself--speaking of the affair to Mrs. Harold Smith as though it\nwere an excellent joke, and to Mrs. Proudie as though she were simply\nemulous of rivalling those world-famous assemblies in Gloucester\nPlace; but the town at large knew that an effort was being made, and\nit was supposed that even Miss Dunstable was somewhat nervous. In\nspite of her excellent joking it was presumed that she would be\nunhappy if she failed.\n\nTo Mrs. Frank Gresham she did speak with some little seriousness.\n\"But why on earth should you give yourself all this trouble?\" that\nlady had said, when Miss Dunstable owned that she was doubtful,\nand unhappy in her doubts, as to the coming of one of the great\ncolleagues of Mr. Supplehouse. \"When such hundreds are coming, big\nwigs and little wigs of all shades, what can it matter whether Mr.\nTowers be there or not?\"\n\nBut Miss Dunstable had answered almost with a screech,--\"My dear, it\nwill be nothing without him. You don't understand; but the fact is,\nthat Tom Towers is everybody and everything at present.\"\n\nAnd then, by no means for the first time, Mrs. Gresham began to\nlecture her friend as to her vanity; in answer to which lecture Miss\nDunstable mysteriously hinted, that if she were only allowed her full\nswing on this occasion,--if all the world would now indulge her, she\nwould-- She did not quite say what she would do, but the inference\ndrawn by Mrs. Gresham was this: that if the incense now offered on\nthe altar of Fashion were accepted, Miss Dunstable would at once\nabandon the pomps and vanities of this wicked world, and all the\nsinful lusts of the flesh.\n\n\"But the doctor will stay, my dear? I hope I may look on that as\nfixed.\"\n\nMiss Dunstable, in making this demand on the doctor's time, showed an\nenergy quite equal to that with which she invoked the gods that Tom\nTowers might not be absent. Now, to tell the truth, Dr. Thorne had at\nfirst thought it very unreasonable that he should be asked to remain\nup in London in order that he might be present at an evening party,\nand had for a while pertinaciously refused; but when he learned that\nthree or four prime ministers were expected, and that it was possible\nthat even Tom Towers might be there in the flesh, his philosophy also\nhad become weak, and he had written to Lady Arabella to say that his\nprolonged absence for two days further must be endured, and that the\nmild tonics, morning and evening, might be continued.\n\nBut why should Miss Dunstable be so anxious that Dr. Thorne should\nbe present on this grand occasion? Why, indeed, should she be so\nfrequently inclined to summon him away from his country practice, his\ncompounding board, and his useful ministrations to rural ailments?\nThe doctor was connected with her by no ties of blood. Their\nfriendship, intimate as it was, had as yet been but of short date.\nShe was a very rich woman, capable of purchasing all manner of advice\nand good counsel, whereas he was so far from being rich, that any\ncontinued disturbance to his practice might be inconvenient to him.\nNevertheless, Miss Dunstable seemed to have no more compunction in\nmaking calls upon his time, than she might have felt had he been her\nbrother. No ideas on this matter suggested themselves to the doctor\nhimself. He was a simple-minded man, taking things as they came,\nand especially so taking things that came pleasantly. He liked Miss\nDunstable, and was gratified by her friendship, and did not think\nof asking himself whether she had a right to put him to trouble and\ninconvenience. But such ideas did occur to Mrs. Gresham, the doctor's\nniece. Had Miss Dunstable any object, and if so, what object? Was\nit simply veneration for the doctor, or was it caprice? Was it\neccentricity--or could it possibly be love?\n\nIn speaking of the ages of these two friends it may be said in round\nterms that the lady was well past forty, and that the gentleman was\nwell past fifty. Under such circumstances could it be love? The lady,\ntoo, was one who had had offers almost by the dozen,--offers from men\nof rank, from men of fashion, and from men of power; from men endowed\nwith personal attractions, with pleasant manners, with cultivated\ntastes, and with eloquent tongues. Not only had she loved none such,\nbut by none such had she been cajoled into an idea that it was\npossible that she could love them. That Dr. Thorne's tastes were\ncultivated, and his manners pleasant, might probably be admitted by\nthree or four old friends in the country who valued him; but the\nworld in London, that world to which Miss Dunstable was accustomed,\nand which was apparently becoming dearer to her day by day, would not\nhave regarded the doctor as a man likely to become the object of a\nlady's passion.\n\nBut nevertheless the idea did occur to Mrs. Gresham. She had been\nbrought up at the elbow of this country practitioner; she had lived\nwith him as though she had been his daughter; she had been for years\nthe ministering angel of his household; and, till her heart had\nopened to the natural love of womanhood, all her closest sympathies\nhad been with him. In her eyes the doctor was all but perfect; and it\ndid not seem to her to be out of the question that Miss Dunstable\nshould have fallen in love with her uncle.\n\nMiss Dunstable once said to Mrs. Harold Smith that it was possible\nthat she might marry, the only condition then expressed being this,\nthat the man elected should be one who was quite indifferent as to\nmoney. Mrs. Harold Smith, who, by her friends, was presumed to know\nthe world with tolerable accuracy, had replied that such a man Miss\nDunstable would never find in this world. All this had passed in that\nhalf comic vein of banter which Miss Dunstable so commonly used when\nconversing with such friends as Mrs. Harold Smith; but she had spoken\nwords of the same import more than once to Mrs. Gresham; and Mrs.\nGresham, putting two and two together as women do, had made four\nof the little sum; and, as the final result of the calculation,\ndetermined that Miss Dunstable would marry Dr. Thorne if Dr. Thorne\nwould ask her.\n\nAnd then Mrs. Gresham began to bethink herself of two other\nquestions. Would it be well that her uncle should marry Miss\nDunstable? and if so, would it be possible to induce him to make such\na proposition? After the consideration of many pros and cons, and the\nbalancing of very various arguments, Mrs. Gresham thought that the\narrangement on the whole might not be a bad one. For Miss Dunstable\nshe herself had a sincere affection, which was shared by her\nhusband. She had often grieved at the sacrifices Miss Dunstable\nmade to the world, thinking that her friend was falling into vanity,\nindifference, and an ill mode of life; but such a marriage as this\nwould probably cure all that. And then as to Dr. Thorne himself, to\nwhose benefit were of course applied Mrs. Gresham's most earnest\nthoughts in this matter, she could not but think that he would be\nhappier married than he was single. In point of temper, no woman\ncould stand higher than Miss Dunstable; no one had ever heard of her\nbeing in an ill humour; and then though Mrs. Gresham was gifted with\na mind which was far removed from being mercenary, it was impossible\nnot to feel that some benefit must accrue from the bride's wealth.\nMary Thorne, the present Mrs. Frank Gresham, had herself been a\ngreat heiress. Circumstances had weighted her hand with enormous\npossessions, and hitherto she had not realized the truth of that\nlesson which would teach us to believe that happiness and riches are\nincompatible. Therefore she resolved that it might be well if the\ndoctor and Miss Dunstable were brought together.\n\nBut could the doctor be induced to make such an offer? Mrs. Gresham\nacknowledged a terrible difficulty in looking at the matter from that\npoint of view. Her uncle was fond of Miss Dunstable; but she was sure\nthat an idea of such a marriage had never entered his head; that\nit would be very difficult--almost impossible--to create such an\nidea; and that if the idea were there, the doctor could hardly be\ninstigated to make the proposition. Looking at the matter as a whole,\nshe feared that the match was not practicable.\n\nOn the day of Miss Dunstable's party, Mrs. Gresham and her uncle\ndined together alone in Portman Square. Mr. Gresham was not yet in\nParliament, but an almost immediate vacancy was expected in his\ndivision of the county, and it was known that no one could stand\nagainst him with any chance of success. This threw him much among the\npoliticians of his party--those giants, namely, whom it would be his\nbusiness to support--and on this account he was a good deal away from\nhis own house at the present moment.\n\n\"Politics make a terrible demand on a man's time,\" he said to his\nwife; and then went down to dine at his club in Pall Mall with sundry\nother young philogeants. On men of that class politics do make a\ngreat demand--at the hour of dinner and thereabouts.\n\n\"What do you think of Miss Dunstable?\" said Mrs. Gresham to her\nuncle, as they sat together over their coffee. She added nothing to\nthe question, but asked it in all its baldness.\n\n\"Think about her!\" said the doctor. \"Well, Mary; what do you think\nabout her? I dare say we think the same.\"\n\n\"But that's not the question. What do you think about her? Do you\nthink she's honest?\"\n\n\"Honest? Oh, yes, certainly--very honest, I should say.\"\n\n\"And good-tempered?\"\n\n\"Uncommonly good-tempered.\"\n\n\"And affectionate?\"\n\n\"Well; yes,--and affectionate. I should certainly say that she is\naffectionate.\"\n\n\"I'm sure she's clever.\"\n\n\"Yes, I think she's clever.\"\n\n\"And, and--and womanly in her feelings.\" Mrs. Gresham felt that she\ncould not quite say lady-like, though she would fain have done so had\nshe dared.\n\n\"Oh, certainly,\" said the doctor. \"But, Mary, why are you dissecting\nMiss Dunstable's character with so much ingenuity?\"\n\n\"Well, uncle, I will tell you why; because--\" and Mrs. Gresham, while\nshe was speaking, got up from her chair, and going round the table to\nher uncle's side, put her arm round his neck till her face was close\nto his, and then continued speaking as she stood behind him out of\nhis sight--\"because--I think that Miss Dunstable is--is very fond of\nyou; and that it would make her happy if you would--ask her to be\nyour wife.\"\n\n\"Mary!\" said the doctor, turning round with an endeavour to look his\nniece in the face.\n\n\"I am quite in earnest, uncle--quite in earnest. From little things\nthat she has said, and little things that I have seen, I do believe\nwhat I now tell you.\"\n\n\"And you want me to--\"\n\n\"Dear uncle; my own one darling uncle, I want you only to do that\nwhich will make you--make you happy. What is Miss Dunstable to me\ncompared to you?\" And then she stooped down and kissed him.\n\nThe doctor was apparently too much astounded by the intimation given\nhim to make any further immediate reply. His niece, seeing this,\nleft him that she might go and dress; and when they met again in the\ndrawing-room Frank Gresham was with them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX.\n\nMISS DUNSTABLE AT HOME.\n\n\nMiss Dunstable did not look like a love-lorn maiden, as she stood in\na small ante-chamber at the top of her drawing-room stairs receiving\nher guests. Her house was one of those abnormal mansions, which are\nto be seen here and there in London, built in compliance rather with\nthe rules of rural architecture, than with those which usually govern\nthe erection of city streets and town terraces. It stood back from\nits brethren, and alone, so that its owner could walk round it. It\nwas approached by a short carriageway; the chief door was in the back\nof the building; and the front of the house looked on to one of the\nparks. Miss Dunstable in procuring it had had her usual luck. It had\nbeen built by an eccentric millionnaire at an enormous cost; and\nthe eccentric millionnaire, after living in it for twelve months,\nhad declared that it did not possess a single comfort, and that\nit was deficient in most of those details which, in point of\nhouse accommodation, are necessary to the very existence of man.\nConsequently the mansion was sold, and Miss Dunstable was the\npurchaser. Cranbourn House it had been named, and its present owner\nhad made no change in this respect; but the world at large very\ngenerally called it Ointment Hall, and Miss Dunstable herself as\nfrequently used that name for it as any other. It was impossible to\nquiz Miss Dunstable with any success, because she always joined in\nthe joke herself.\n\nNot a word further had passed between Mrs. Gresham and Dr. Thorne on\nthe subject of their last conversation; but the doctor as he entered\nthe lady's portals amongst a tribe of servants and in a glare of\nlight, and saw the crowd before him and the crowd behind him, felt\nthat it was quite impossible that he should ever be at home there.\nIt might be all right that a Miss Dunstable should live in this way,\nbut it could not be right that the wife of Dr. Thorne should so live.\nBut all this was a matter of the merest speculation, for he was\nwell aware--as he said to himself a dozen times--that his niece had\nblundered strangely in her reading of Miss Dunstable's character.\n\nWhen the Gresham party entered the ante-room into which the staircase\nopened, they found Miss Dunstable standing there surrounded by a few\nof her most intimate allies. Mrs. Harold Smith was sitting quite\nclose to her; Dr. Easyman was reclining on a sofa against the wall,\nand the lady who habitually lived with Miss Dunstable was by his\nside. One or two others were there also, so that a little running\nconversation was kept up, in order to relieve Miss Dunstable of the\ntedium which might otherwise be engendered by the work she had in\nhand. As Mrs. Gresham, leaning on her husband's arm, entered the\nroom, she saw the back of Mrs. Proudie, as that lady made her way\nthrough the opposite door, leaning on the arm of the bishop.\n\nMrs. Harold Smith had apparently recovered from the annoyance which\nshe must no doubt have felt when Miss Dunstable so utterly rejected\nher suit on behalf of her brother. If any feeling had existed, even\nfor a day, calculated to put a stop to the intimacy between the two\nladies, that feeling had altogether died away, for Mrs. Harold Smith\nwas conversing with her friend, quite in the old way. She made some\nremark on each of the guests as they passed by, and apparently did\nso in a manner satisfactory to the owner of the house, for Miss\nDunstable answered with her kindest smiles, and in that genial, happy\ntone of voice which gave its peculiar character to her good humour:\n\n\"She is quite convinced that you are a mere plagiarist in what you\nare doing,\" said Mrs. Harold Smith, speaking of Mrs. Proudie.\n\n\"And so I am. I don't suppose there can be anything very original\nnow-a-days about an evening party.\"\n\n\"But she thinks you are copying her.\"\n\n\"And why not? I copy everybody that I see, more or less. You did not\nat first begin to wear big petticoats out of your own head? If Mrs.\nProudie has any such pride as that, pray don't rob her of it. Here's\nthe doctor and the Greshams. Mary, my darling, how are you?\" and in\nspite of all her grandeur of apparel, Miss Dunstable took hold of\nMrs. Gresham and kissed her--to the disgust of the dozen-and-a-half\nof the distinguished fashionable world who were passing up the stairs\nbehind.\n\nThe doctor was somewhat repressed in his mode of address by the\ncommunication which had so lately been made to him. Miss Dunstable\nwas now standing on the very top of the pinnacle of wealth, and\nseemed to him to be not only so much above his reach, but also so\nfar removed from his track in life, that he could not in any way put\nhimself on a level with her. He could neither aspire so high nor\ndescend so low; and thinking of this he spoke to Miss Dunstable as\nthough there were some great distance between them,--as though there\nhad been no hours of intimate friendship down at Greshamsbury. There\nhad been such hours, during which Miss Dunstable and Dr. Thorne had\nlived as though they belonged to the same world: and this at any rate\nmay be said of Miss Dunstable, that she had no idea of forgetting\nthem.\n\nDr. Thorne merely gave her his hand, and then prepared to pass on.\n\n\"Don't go, doctor,\" she said; \"for heaven's sake, don't go yet. I\ndon't know when I may catch you if you get in there. I shan't be able\nto follow you for the next two hours. Lady Meredith, I am so much\nobliged to you for coming--your mother will be here, I hope. Oh, I am\nso glad! From her you know that is quite a favour. You, Sir George,\nare half a sinner yourself, so I don't think so much about it.\"\n\n\"Oh, quite so,\" said Sir George; \"perhaps rather the largest half.\"\n\n\"The men divide the world into gods and giants,\" said Miss Dunstable.\n\"We women have our divisions also. We are saints or sinners according\nto our party. The worst of it is, that we rat almost as often as you\ndo.\" Whereupon Sir George laughed and passed on.\n\n\"I know, doctor, you don't like this kind of thing,\" she continued,\n\"but there is no reason why you should indulge yourself altogether in\nyour own way, more than another--is there, Frank?\"\n\n\"I am not so sure but he does like it,\" said Mr. Gresham. \"There are\nsome of your reputed friends whom he owns that he is anxious to see.\"\n\n\"Are there? Then there is some hope of his ratting too. But he'll\nnever make a good staunch sinner; will he, Mary? You're too old to\nlearn new tricks; eh, doctor?\"\n\n\"I am afraid I am,\" said the doctor, with a faint laugh.\n\n\"Does Dr. Thorne rank himself among the army of saints?\" asked Mrs.\nHarold Smith.\n\n\"Decidedly,\" said Miss Dunstable. \"But you must always remember that\nthere are saints of different orders; are there not, Mary? and nobody\nsupposes that the Franciscans and the Dominicans agree very well\ntogether. Dr. Thorne does not belong to the school of St. Proudie,\nof Barchester; he would prefer the priestess whom I see coming round\nthe corner of the staircase, with a very famous young novice at her\nelbow.\"\n\n\"From all that I can hear, you will have to reckon Miss Grantly among\nthe sinners,\" said Mrs. Harold Smith--seeing that Lady Lufton with\nher young friend was approaching--\"unless, indeed, you can make a\nsaint of Lady Hartletop.\"\n\nAnd then Lady Lufton entered the room, and Miss Dunstable came\nforward to meet her with more quiet respect in her manner than she\nhad as yet shown to many of her guests. \"I am much obliged to you for\ncoming, Lady Lufton,\" she said, \"and the more so, for bringing Miss\nGrantly with you.\"\n\nLady Lufton uttered some pretty little speech, during which Dr.\nThorne came up and shook hands with her; as did also Frank Gresham\nand his wife. There was a county acquaintance between the Framley\npeople and the Greshamsbury people, and therefore there was a little\ngeneral conversation before Lady Lufton passed out of the small\nroom into what Mrs. Proudie would have called the noble suite of\napartments. \"Papa will be here,\" said Miss Grantly; \"at least so I\nunderstand. I have not seen him yet myself.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, he has promised me,\" said Miss Dunstable; \"and the\narchdeacon, I know, will keep his word. I should by no means have the\nproper ecclesiastical balance without him.\"\n\n\"Papa always does keep his word,\" said Miss Grantly, in a tone\nthat was almost severe. She had not at all understood poor Miss\nDunstable's little joke, or at any rate she was too dignified to\nrespond to it.\n\n\"I understand that old Sir John is to accept the Chiltern Hundreds\nat once,\" said Lady Lufton, in a half whisper to Frank Gresham. Lady\nLufton had always taken a keen interest in the politics of East\nBarsetshire, and was now desirous of expressing her satisfaction that\na Gresham should again sit for the county. The Greshams had been old\ncounty members in Barsetshire, time out of mind.\n\n\"Oh, yes; I believe so,\" said Frank, blushing. He was still young\nenough to feel almost ashamed of putting himself forward for such\nhigh honours.\n\n\"There will be no contest, of course,\" said Lady Lufton,\nconfidentially. \"There seldom is in East Barsetshire, I am happy to\nsay. But if there were, every tenant at Framley would vote on the\nright side; I can assure you of that. Lord Lufton was saying so to me\nonly this morning.\"\n\nFrank Gresham made a pretty little speech in reply, such as young\nsucking politicians are expected to make; and this, with sundry other\nsmall courteous murmurings, detained the Lufton party for a minute or\ntwo in the ante-chamber. In the meantime the world was pressing on\nand passing through to the four or five large reception-rooms--the\nnoble suite, which was already piercing poor Mrs. Proudie's heart\nwith envy to the very core. \"These are the sort of rooms,\" she said\nto herself unconsciously, \"which ought to be provided by the country\nfor the use of its bishops.\"\n\n\"But the people are not brought enough together,\" she said to her\nlord.\n\n\"No, no; I don't think they are,\" said the bishop.\n\n\"And that is so essential for a conversazione,\" continued Mrs.\nProudie. \"Now in Gloucester Place--.\" But we will not record all\nher adverse criticisms, as Lady Lufton is waiting for us in the\nante-room.\n\nAnd now another arrival of moment had taken place;--an arrival\nindeed of very great moment. To tell the truth, Miss Dunstable's\nheart had been set upon having two special persons; and though\nno stone had been left unturned,--no stone which could be turned\nwith discretion,--she was still left in doubt as to both these two\nwondrous potentates. At the very moment of which we are now speaking,\nlight and airy as she appeared to be--for it was her character to be\nlight and airy--her mind was torn with doubts. If the wished-for two\nwould come, her evening would be thoroughly successful; but if not,\nall her trouble would have been thrown away, and the thing would\nhave been a failure; and there were circumstances connected with the\npresent assembly which made Miss Dunstable very anxious that she\nshould not fail. That the two great ones of the earth were Tom Towers\nof the _Jupiter_, and the Duke of Omnium, need hardly be expressed in\nwords.\n\nAnd now, at this very moment, as Lady Lufton was making her civil\nspeeches to young Gresham, apparently in no hurry to move on, and\nwhile Miss Dunstable was endeavouring to whisper something into the\ndoctor's ear, which would make him feel himself at home in this new\nworld, a sound was heard which made that lady know that half her wish\nhad at any rate been granted to her. A sound was heard--but only by\nher own and one other attentive pair of ears. Mrs. Harold Smith had\nalso caught the name, and knew that the duke was approaching.\n\nThere was great glory and triumph in this; but why had his grace come\nat so unchancy a moment? Miss Dunstable had been fully aware of the\nimpropriety of bringing Lady Lufton and the Duke of Omnium into the\nsame house at the same time; but when she had asked Lady Lufton, she\nhad been led to believe that there was no hope of obtaining the duke;\nand then, when that hope had dawned upon her, she had comforted\nherself with the reflection that the two suns, though they might for\nsome few minutes be in the same hemisphere, could hardly be expected\nto clash, or come across each other's orbits. Her rooms were large\nand would be crowded; the duke would probably do little more than\nwalk through them once, and Lady Lufton would certainly be surrounded\nby persons of her own class. Thus Miss Dunstable had comforted\nherself. But now all things were going wrong, and Lady Lufton would\nfind herself in close contiguity to the nearest representative of\nSatanic agency, which, according to her ideas, was allowed to walk\nthis nether English world of ours. Would she scream? or indignantly\nretreat out of the house?--or would she proudly raise her head, and\nwith outstretched hand and audible voice, boldly defy the devil and\nall his works? In thinking of these things as the duke approached\nMiss Dunstable almost lost her presence of mind.\n\nBut Mrs. Harold Smith did not lose hers. \"So here at last is the\nduke,\" she said, in a tone intended to catch the express attention of\nLady Lufton.\n\nMrs. Smith had calculated that there might still be time for her\nladyship to pass on and avoid the interview. But Lady Lufton, if she\nheard the words, did not completely understand them. At any rate\nthey did not convey to her mind at the moment the meaning they were\nintended to convey. She paused to whisper a last little speech to\nFrank Gresham, and then looking round, found that the gentleman who\nwas pressing against her dress was--the Duke of Omnium!\n\nOn this great occasion, when the misfortune could no longer be\navoided, Miss Dunstable was by no means beneath herself or her\ncharacter. She deplored the calamity, but she now saw that it was\nonly left to her to make the best of it. The duke had honoured her\nby coming to her house, and she was bound to welcome him, though in\ndoing so she should bring Lady Lufton to her last gasp.\n\n\"Duke,\" she said, \"I am greatly honoured by this kindness on the part\nof your grace. I hardly expected that you would be so good to me.\"\n\n\"The goodness is all on the other side,\" said the duke, bowing over\nher hand.\n\nAnd then in the usual course of things this would have been all. The\nduke would have walked on and shown himself, would have said a word\nor two to Lady Hartletop, to the bishop, to Mr. Gresham, and such\nlike, and would then have left the rooms by another way, and quietly\nescaped. This was the duty expected from him, and this he would have\ndone, and the value of the party would have been increased thirty per\ncent. by such doing; but now, as it was, the news-mongers of the West\nEnd were likely to get much more out of him.\n\nCircumstances had so turned out that he had absolutely been pressed\nclose against Lady Lufton, and she, when she heard the voice, and was\nmade positively acquainted with the fact of the great man's presence\nby Miss Dunstable's words, turned round quickly, but still with much\nfeminine dignity, removing her dress from the contact. In doing this\nshe was brought absolutely face to face with the duke, so that each\ncould not but look full at the other. \"I beg your pardon,\" said the\nduke. They were the only words that had ever passed between them,\nnor have they spoken to each other since; but simple as they were,\naccompanied by the little by-play of the speakers, they gave rise\nto a considerable amount of ferment in the fashionable world. Lady\nLufton, as she retreated back on to Dr. Easyman, curtseyed low;\nshe curtseyed low and slowly, and with a haughty arrangement of\nher drapery that was all her own; but the curtsey, though it was\neloquent, did not say half so much,--did not reprobate the habitual\niniquities of the duke with a voice nearly as potent as that which\nwas expressed in the gradual fall of her eye and the gradual pressure\nof her lips. When she commenced her curtsey she was looking full\nin her foe's face. By the time that she had completed it her eyes\nwere turned upon the ground, but there was an ineffable amount of\nscorn expressed in the lines of her mouth. She spoke no word, and\nretreated, as modest virtue and feminine weakness must ever retreat,\nbefore barefaced vice and virile power; but nevertheless she was held\nby all the world to have had the best of the encounter. The duke,\nas he begged her pardon, wore in his countenance that expression of\nmodified sorrow which is common to any gentleman who is supposed\nby himself to have incommoded a lady. But over and above this,--or\nrather under it,--there was a slight smile of derision, as though\nit were impossible for him to look upon the bearing of Lady Lufton\nwithout some amount of ridicule. All this was legible to eyes so\nkeen as those of Miss Dunstable and Mrs. Harold Smith, and the duke\nwas known to be a master of this silent inward sarcasm; but even by\nthem,--by Miss Dunstable and Mrs. Harold Smith,--it was admitted that\nLady Lufton had conquered. When her ladyship again looked up, the\nduke had passed on; she then resumed the care of Miss Grantly's hand,\nand followed in among the company.\n\n\n[Illustration: Lady Lufton and the Duke of Omnium.]\n\n\n\"That is what I call unfortunate,\" said Miss Dunstable, as soon as\nboth belligerents had departed from the field of battle. \"The fates\nsometimes will be against one.\"\n\n\"But they have not been at all against you here,\" said Mrs. Harold\nSmith. \"If you could arrive at her ladyship's private thoughts\nto-morrow morning, you would find her to be quite happy in having\nmet the duke. It will be years before she has done boasting of her\ntriumph, and it will be talked of by the young ladies of Framley for\nthe next three generations.\"\n\nThe Gresham party, including Dr. Thorne, had remained in the\nante-chamber during the battle. The whole combat did not occupy above\ntwo minutes, and the three of them were hemmed off from escape by\nLady Lufton's retreat into Dr. Easyman's lap; but now they, too,\nessayed to pass on.\n\n\"What, you will desert me,\" said Miss Dunstable. \"Very well; but I\nshall find you out by-and-by. Frank, there is to be some dancing in\none of the rooms,--just to distinguish the affair from Mrs. Proudie's\nconversazione. It would be stupid, you know, if all conversaziones\nwere alike; wouldn't it? So I hope you will go and dance.\"\n\n\"There will, I presume, be another variation at feeding time,\" said\nMrs. Harold Smith.\n\n\"Oh, yes; certainly; I am the most vulgar of all wretches in\nthat respect. I do love to set people eating and drinking.--Mr.\nSupplehouse, I am delighted to see you; but do tell me--\" and then\nshe whispered with great energy into the ear of Mr. Supplehouse, and\nMr. Supplehouse again whispered into her ear. \"You think he will,\nthen?\" said Miss Dunstable.\n\nMr. Supplehouse assented; he did think so; but he had no warrant for\nstating the circumstance as a fact. And then he passed on, hardly\nlooking at Mrs. Harold Smith as he passed.\n\n\"What a hang-dog countenance he has,\" said that lady.\n\n\"Ah! you're prejudiced, my dear, and no wonder; as for myself I\nalways liked Supplehouse. He means mischief; but then mischief is his\ntrade, and he does not conceal it. If I were a politician I should as\nsoon think of being angry with Mr. Supplehouse for turning against me\nas I am now with a pin for pricking me. It's my own awkwardness, and\nI ought to have known how to use the pin more craftily.\"\n\n\"But you must detest a man who professes to stand by his party, and\nthen does his best to ruin it.\"\n\n\"So many have done that, my dear; and with much more success than Mr.\nSupplehouse! All is fair in love and war,--why not add politics to\nthe list? If we could only agree to do that, it would save us from\nsuch a deal of heartburning, and would make none of us a bit the\nworse.\"\n\nMiss Dunstable's rooms, large as they were--\"a noble suite of\nrooms certainly, though perhaps a little too--too--too scattered,\nwe will say, eh, bishop?\"--were now nearly full, and would have\nbeen inconveniently crowded, were it not that many who came only\nremained for half-an-hour or so. Space, however, had been kept for\nthe dancers--much to Mrs. Proudie's consternation. Not that she\ndisapproved of dancing in London, as a rule; but she was indignant\nthat the laws of a conversazione, as re-established by herself in the\nfashionable world, should be so violently infringed.\n\n\"Conversaziones will come to mean nothing,\" she said to the bishop,\nputting great stress on the latter word, \"nothing at all, if they are\nto be treated in this way.\"\n\n\"No, they won't; nothing in the least,\" said the bishop.\n\n\"Dancing may be very well in its place,\" said Mrs. Proudie.\n\n\"I have never objected to it myself; that is, for the laity,\" said\nthe bishop.\n\n\"But when people profess to assemble for higher objects,\" said Mrs.\nProudie, \"they ought to act up to their professions.\"\n\n\"Otherwise they are no better than hypocrites,\" said the bishop.\n\n\"A spade should be called a spade,\" said Mrs. Proudie.\n\n\"Decidedly,\" said the bishop, assenting.\n\n\"And when I undertook the trouble and expense of introducing\nconversaziones,\" continued Mrs. Proudie, with an evident feeling that\nshe had been ill-used, \"I had no idea of seeing the word so--so--so\nmisinterpreted;\" and then observing certain desirable acquaintances\nat the other side of the room, she went across, leaving the bishop to\nfend for himself.\n\nLady Lufton, having achieved her success, passed on to the dancing,\nwhither it was not probable that her enemy would follow her, and she\nhad not been there very long before she was joined by her son. Her\nheart at the present moment was not quite satisfied at the state of\naffairs with reference to Griselda. She had gone so far as to tell\nher young friend what were her own wishes; she had declared her\ndesire that Griselda should become her daughter-in-law; but in answer\nto this Griselda herself had declared nothing. It was, to be sure,\nno more than natural that a young lady so well brought up as Miss\nGrantly should show no signs of a passion till she was warranted in\nshowing them by the proceedings of the gentleman; but notwithstanding\nthis--fully aware as she was of the propriety of such reticence--Lady\nLufton did think that to her Griselda might have spoken some word\nevincing that the alliance would be satisfactory to her. Griselda,\nhowever, had spoken no such word, nor had she uttered a syllable to\nshow that she would accept Lord Lufton if he did offer. Then again\nshe had uttered no syllable to show that she would not accept him;\nbut, nevertheless, although she knew that the world had been talking\nabout her and Lord Dumbello, she stood up to dance with the future\nmarquess on every possible occasion. All this did give annoyance\nto Lady Lufton, who began to bethink herself that if she could not\nquickly bring her little plan to a favourable issue, it might be well\nfor her to wash her hands of it. She was still anxious for the match\non her son's account. Griselda would, she did not doubt, make a good\nwife; but Lady Lufton was not so sure as she once had been that\nshe herself would be able to keep up so strong a feeling for her\ndaughter-in-law as she had hitherto hoped to do.\n\n\"Ludovic, have you been here long?\" she said, smiling as she always\ndid smile when her eyes fell upon her son's face.\n\n\"This instant arrived; and I hurried on after you, as Miss Dunstable\ntold me that you were here. What a crowd she has! Did you see Lord\nBrock?\"\n\n\"I did not observe him.\"\n\n\"Or Lord De Terrier? I saw them both in the centre room.\"\n\n\"Lord De Terrier did me the honour of shaking hands with me as I\npassed through.\"\n\n\"I never saw such a mixture of people. There is Mrs. Proudie going\nout of her mind because you are all going to dance.\"\n\n\"The Miss Proudies dance,\" said Griselda Grantly.\n\n\"But not at conversaziones. You don't see the difference. And I saw\nSpermoil there, looking as pleased as Punch. He had quite a circle of\nhis own round him, and was chattering away as though he were quite\naccustomed to the wickednesses of the world.\"\n\n\"There certainly are people here whom one would not have wished to\nmeet, had one thought of it,\" said Lady Lufton, mindful of her late\nengagement.\n\n\"But it must be all right, for I walked up the stairs with the\narchdeacon. That is an absolute proof, is it not, Miss Grantly?\"\n\n\"I have no fears. When I am with your mother I know I must be safe.\"\n\n\"I am not so sure of that,\" said Lord Lufton, laughing. \"Mother, you\nhardly know the worst of it yet. Who is here, do you think?\"\n\n\"I know whom you mean; I have seen him,\" said Lady Lufton, very\nquietly.\n\n\"We came across him just at the top of the stairs,\" said Griselda,\nwith more animation in her face than ever Lord Lufton had seen there\nbefore.\n\n\"What; the duke?\"\n\n\"Yes, the duke,\" said Lady Lufton. \"I certainly should not have come\nhad I expected to be brought in contact with that man. But it was an\naccident, and on such an occasion as this it could not be helped.\"\n\nLord Lufton at once perceived, by the tone of his mother's voice and\nby the shades of her countenance that she had absolutely endured some\npersonal encounter with the duke, and also that she was by no means\nso indignant at the occurrence as might have been expected. There she\nwas, still in Miss Dunstable's house, and expressing no anger as to\nMiss Dunstable's conduct. Lord Lufton could hardly have been more\nsurprised had he seen the duke handing his mother down to supper; he\nsaid, however, nothing further on the subject.\n\n\"Are you going to dance, Ludovic?\" said Lady Lufton.\n\n\"Well, I am not sure that I do not agree with Mrs. Proudie in\nthinking that dancing would contaminate a conversazione. What are\nyour ideas, Miss Grantly?\"\n\nGriselda was never very good at a joke, and imagined that Lord Lufton\nwanted to escape the trouble of dancing with her. This angered her.\nFor the only species of love-making, or flirtation, or sociability\nbetween herself as a young lady, and any other self as a young\ngentleman, which recommended itself to her taste, was to be found in\nthe amusement of dancing. She was altogether at variance with Mrs.\nProudie on this matter, and gave Miss Dunstable great credit for her\ninnovation. In society Griselda's toes were more serviceable to her\nthan her tongue, and she was to be won by a rapid twirl much more\nprobably than by a soft word. The offer of which she would approve\nwould be conveyed by two all but breathless words during a spasmodic\npause in a waltz; and then as she lifted up her arm to receive the\naccustomed support at her back, she might just find power enough to\nsay, \"You--must ask--papa.\" After that she would not care to have the\naffair mentioned till everything was properly settled.\n\n\"I have not thought about it,\" said Griselda, turning her face away\nfrom Lord Lufton.\n\nIt must not, however, be supposed that Miss Grantly had not thought\nabout Lord Lufton, or that she had not considered how great might be\nthe advantage of having Lady Lufton on her side if she made up her\nmind that she did wish to become Lord Lufton's wife. She knew well\nthat now was her time for a triumph, now in this very first season of\nher acknowledged beauty; and she knew also that young, good-looking\nbachelor lords do not grow on hedges like blackberries. Had Lord\nLufton offered to her, she would have accepted him at once without\nany remorse as to the greater glories which might appertain to a\nfuture Marchioness of Hartletop. In that direction she was not\nwithout sufficient wisdom. But then Lord Lufton had not offered\nto her, nor given any signs that he intended to do so; and to\ngive Griselda Grantly her due, she was not a girl to make a first\noverture. Neither had Lord Dumbello offered; but he had given\nsigns,--dumb signs, such as birds give to each other, quite as\nintelligible as verbal signs to a girl who preferred the use of her\ntoes to that of her tongue.\n\n\"I have not thought about it,\" said Griselda, very coldly, and at\nthat moment a gentleman stood before her and asked her hand for the\nnext dance. It was Lord Dumbello; and Griselda, making no reply\nexcept by a slight bow, got up and put her hand within her partner's\narm.\n\n\"Shall I find you here, Lady Lufton, when we have done?\" she said;\nand then started off among the dancers. When the work before one is\ndancing the proper thing for a gentleman to do is, at any rate, to\nask a lady; this proper thing Lord Lufton had omitted, and now the\nprize was taken away from under his very nose.\n\nThere was clearly an air of triumph about Lord Dumbello as he walked\naway with the beauty. The world had been saying that Lord Lufton was\nto marry her, and the world had also been saying that Lord Dumbello\nadmired her. Now this had angered Lord Dumbello, and made him feel\nas though he walked about, a mark of scorn, as a disappointed suitor.\nHad it not been for Lord Lufton, perhaps he would not have cared so\nmuch for Griselda Grantly; but circumstances had so turned out that\nhe did care for her, and felt it to be incumbent upon him as the\nheir to a marquisate to obtain what he wanted, let who would have a\nhankering after the same article. It is in this way that pictures are\nso well sold at auctions; and Lord Dumbello regarded Miss Grantly\nas being now subject to the auctioneer's hammer, and conceived that\nLord Lufton was bidding against him. There was, therefore, an air\nof triumph about him as he put his arm round Griselda's waist and\nwhirled her up and down the room in obedience to the music.\n\nLady Lufton and her son were left together looking at each other.\nOf course he had intended to ask Griselda to dance, but it cannot\nbe said that he very much regretted his disappointment. Of course\nalso Lady Lufton had expected that her son and Griselda would stand\nup together, and she was a little inclined to be angry with her\n_prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9e_.\n\n\"I think she might have waited a minute,\" said Lady Lufton.\n\n\"But why, mother? There are certain things for which no one ever\nwaits: to give a friend, for instance, the first passage through a\ngate out hunting, and such like. Miss Grantly was quite right to take\nthe first that offered.\"\n\nLady Lufton had determined to learn what was to be the end of this\nscheme of hers. She could not have Griselda always with her, and if\nanything were to be arranged it must be arranged now, while both of\nthem were in London. At the close of the season Griselda would return\nto Plumstead, and Lord Lufton would go--nobody as yet knew where. It\nwould be useless to look forward to further opportunities. If they\ndid not contrive to love each other now, they would never do so. Lady\nLufton was beginning to fear that her plan would not work, but she\nmade up her mind that she would learn the truth then and there,--at\nleast as far as her son was concerned.\n\n\"Oh, yes; quite so;--if it is equal to her with which she dances,\"\nsaid Lady Lufton.\n\n\"Quite equal, I should think--unless it be that Dumbello is\nlonger-winded than I am.\"\n\n\"I am sorry to hear you speak of her in that way, Ludovic.\"\n\n\"Why sorry, mother?\"\n\n\"Because I had hoped--that you and she would have liked each other.\"\nThis she said in a serious tone of voice, tender and sad, looking up\ninto his face with a plaintive gaze, as though she knew that she were\nasking of him some great favour.\n\n\"Yes, mother, I have known that you have wished that.\"\n\n\"You have known it, Ludovic!\"\n\n\"Oh, dear, yes; you are not at all sharp at keeping your secrets\nfrom me. And, mother, at one time, for a day or so, I thought that I\ncould oblige you. You have been so good to me, that I would almost do\nanything for you.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, no, no,\" she said, deprecating his praise, and the sacrifice\nwhich he seemed to offer of his own hopes and aspirations. \"I would\nnot for worlds have you do so for my sake. No mother ever had a\nbetter son, and my only ambition is for your happiness.\"\n\n\"But, mother, she would not make me happy. I was mad enough for a\nmoment to think that she could do so--for a moment I did think so.\nThere was one occasion on which I would have asked her to take me,\nbut--\"\n\n\"But what, Ludovic?\"\n\n\"Never mind; it passed away; and now I shall never ask her. Indeed\nI do not think she would have me. She is ambitious, and flying at\nhigher game than I am. And I must say this for her, that she knows\nwell what she is doing, and plays her cards as though she had been\nborn with them in her hand.\"\n\n\"You will never ask her?\"\n\n\"No, mother; had I done so, it would have been for love of you--only\nfor love of you.\"\n\n\"I would not for worlds that you should do that.\"\n\n\"Let her have Dumbello; she will make an excellent wife for him, just\nthe wife that he will want. And you, you will have been so good to\nher in assisting her to such a matter.\"\n\n\"But, Ludovic, I am so anxious to see you settled.\"\n\n\"All in good time, mother!\"\n\n\"Ah, but the good time is passing away. Years run so very quickly. I\nhope you think about marrying, Ludovic.\"\n\n\"But, mother, what if I brought you a wife that you did not approve?\"\n\n\"I will approve of any one that you love; that is--\"\n\n\"That is, if you love her also; eh, mother?\"\n\n\"But I rely with such confidence on your taste. I know that you can\nlike no one that is not lady-like and good.\"\n\n\"Lady-like and good! Will that suffice?\" said he, thinking of Lucy\nRobarts.\n\n\"Yes; it will suffice, if you love her. I don't want you to care for\nmoney. Griselda will have a fortune that would have been convenient;\nbut I do not wish you to care for that.\" And thus, as they stood\ntogether in Miss Dunstable's crowded room, the mother and son settled\nbetween themselves that the Lufton-Grantly alliance treaty was not\nto be ratified. \"I suppose I must let Mrs. Grantly know,\" said Lady\nLufton to herself, as Griselda returned to her side. There had\nnot been above a dozen words spoken between Lord Dumbello and his\npartner, but that young lady also had now fully made up her mind that\nthe treaty above mentioned should never be brought into operation.\n\nWe must go back to our hostess, whom we should not have left for so\nlong a time, seeing that this chapter is written to show how well\nshe could conduct herself in great emergencies. She had declared\nthat after awhile she would be able to leave her position near the\nentrance door, and find out her own peculiar friends among the crowd;\nbut the opportunity for doing so did not come till very late in the\nevening. There was a continuation of arrivals; she was wearied to\ndeath with making little speeches, and had more than once declared\nthat she must depute Mrs. Harold Smith to take her place.\n\nThat lady stuck to her through all her labours with admirable\nconstancy, and made the work bearable. Without some such constancy\non a friend's part, it would have been unbearable. And it must\nbe acknowledged that this was much to the credit of Mrs. Harold\nSmith. Her own hopes with reference to the great heiress had all\nbeen shattered, and her answer had been given to her in very plain\nlanguage. But, nevertheless, she was true to her friendship, and was\nalmost as willing to endure fatigue on the occasion as though she had\na sister-in-law's right in the house.\n\nAt about one o'clock her brother came. He had not yet seen Miss\nDunstable since the offer had been made, and had now with difficulty\nbeen persuaded by his sister to show himself.\n\n\"What can be the use?\" said he. \"The game is up with me\nnow;\"--meaning, poor, ruined ne'er-do-well, not only that that game\nwith Miss Dunstable was up, but that the great game of his whole life\nwas being brought to an uncomfortable termination.\n\n\"Nonsense,\" said his sister. \"Do you mean to despair because a man\nlike the Duke of Omnium wants his money? What has been good security\nfor him will be good security for another;\" and then Mrs. Harold\nSmith made herself more agreeable than ever to Miss Dunstable.\n\nWhen Miss Dunstable was nearly worn out, but was still endeavouring\nto buoy herself up by a hope of the still-expected great arrival--for\nshe knew that the hero would show himself only at a very late hour\nif it were to be her good fortune that he showed himself at all--Mr.\nSowerby walked up the stairs. He had schooled himself to go through\nthis ordeal with all the cool effrontery which was at his command;\nbut it was clearly to be seen that all his effrontery did not stand\nhim in sufficient stead, and that the interview would have been\nembarrassing had it not been for the genuine good-humour of the lady.\n\n\"Here is my brother,\" said Mrs. Harold Smith, showing by the\ntremulousness of the whisper that she looked forward to the meeting\nwith some amount of apprehension.\n\n\"How do you do, Mr. Sowerby?\" said Miss Dunstable, walking almost\ninto the doorway to welcome him. \"Better late than never.\"\n\n\"I have only just got away from the House,\" said he, as he gave her\nhis hand.\n\n\"Oh, I know well that you are _sans reproche_ among senators;--as Mr.\nHarold Smith is _sans peur_;--eh, my dear?\"\n\n\"I must confess that you have contrived to be uncommonly severe upon\nthem both,\" said Mrs. Harold, laughing; \"and as regards poor Harold,\nmost undeservedly so: Nathaniel is here, and may defend himself.\"\n\n\"And no one is better able to do so on all occasions. But, my dear\nMr. Sowerby, I am dying of despair. Do you think he'll come?\"\n\n\"He? who?\"\n\n\"You stupid man--as if there were more than one he! There were two,\nbut the other has been.\"\n\n\"Upon my word, I don't understand,\" said Mr. Sowerby, now again at\nhis ease. \"But can I do anything? shall I go and fetch any one? Oh,\nTom Towers! I fear I can't help you. But here he is at the foot of\nthe stairs!\" And then Mr. Sowerby stood back with his sister to make\nway for the great representative man of the age.\n\n\"Angels and ministers of grace, assist me!\" said Miss Dunstable. \"How\non earth am I to behave myself? Mr. Sowerby, do you think that I\nought to kneel down? My dear, will he have a reporter at his back\nin the royal livery?\" And then Miss Dunstable advanced two or three\nsteps--not into the doorway, as she had done for Mr. Sowerby--put out\nher hand, and smiled her sweetest on Mr. Towers, of the _Jupiter_.\n\n\"Mr. Towers,\" she said, \"I am delighted to have this opportunity of\nseeing you in my own house.\"\n\n\"Miss Dunstable, I am immensely honoured by the privilege of being\nhere,\" said he.\n\n\"The honour done is all conferred on me,\" and she bowed and curtseyed\nwith very stately grace. Each thoroughly understood the badinage of\nthe other; and then, in a few moments, they were engaged in very easy\nconversation.\n\n\"By-the-by, Sowerby, what do you think of this threatened\ndissolution?\" said Tom Towers.\n\n\"We are all in the hands of Providence,\" said Mr. Sowerby, striving\nto take the matter without any outward show of emotion. But the\nquestion was one of terrible import to him, and up to this time he\nhad heard of no such threat. Nor had Mrs. Harold Smith, nor Miss\nDunstable, nor had a hundred others who now either listened to the\nvaticinations of Mr. Towers, or to the immediate report made of\nthem. But it is given to some men to originate such tidings, and the\nperformance of the prophecy is often brought about by the authority\nof the prophet. On the following morning the rumour that there would\nbe a dissolution was current in all high circles. \"They have no\nconscience in such matters; no conscience whatever,\" said a small\ngod, speaking of the giants,--a small god, whose constituency was\nexpensive.\n\nMr. Towers stood there chatting for about twenty minutes, and then\ntook his departure without making his way into the room. He had\nanswered the purpose for which he had been invited, and left Miss\nDunstable in a happy frame of mind.\n\n\"I am very glad that he came,\" said Mrs. Harold Smith, with an air of\ntriumph.\n\n\"Yes, I am glad,\" said Miss Dunstable, \"though I am thoroughly\nashamed that I should be so. After all, what good has he done to me\nor to any one?\" And having uttered this moral reflection, she made\nher way into the rooms, and soon discovered Dr. Thorne standing by\nhimself against the wall.\n\n\"Well, doctor,\" she said, \"where are Mary and Frank? You do not look\nat all comfortable, standing here by yourself.\"\n\n\"I am quite as comfortable as I expected, thank you,\" said he. \"They\nare in the room somewhere, and, as I believe, equally happy.\"\n\n\"That's spiteful in you, doctor, to speak in that way. What would you\nsay if you were called on to endure all that I have gone through this\nevening?\"\n\n\"There is no accounting for tastes, but I presume you like it.\"\n\n\"I am not so sure of that. Give me your arm, and let me get some\nsupper. One always likes the idea of having done hard work, and one\nalways likes to have been successful.\"\n\n\"We all know that virtue is its own reward,\" said the doctor.\n\n\"Well, that is something hard upon me,\" said Miss Dunstable, as she\nsat down to table. \"And you really think that no good of any sort can\ncome from my giving such a party as this?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; some people, no doubt, have been amused.\"\n\n\"It is all vanity in your estimation,\" said Miss Dunstable; \"vanity\nand vexation of spirit. Well; there is a good deal of the latter,\ncertainly. Sherry, if you please. I would give anything for a glass\nof beer, but that is out of the question. Vanity and vexation of\nspirit! And yet I meant to do good.\"\n\n\"Pray, do not suppose that I am condemning you, Miss Dunstable.\"\n\n\"Ah, but I do suppose it. Not only you, but another also, whose\njudgment I care for perhaps more than yours; and that, let me tell\nyou, is saying a great deal. You do condemn me, Dr. Thorne, and I\nalso condemn myself. It is not that I have done wrong, but the game\nis not worth the candle.\"\n\n\"Ah; that's the question.\"\n\n\"The game is not worth the candle. And yet it was a triumph to have\nboth the duke and Tom Towers. You must confess that I have not.\nmanaged badly.\"\n\nSoon after that the Greshams went away, and in an hour's time or so,\nMiss Dunstable was allowed to drag herself to her own bed.\n\nThat is the great question to be asked on all such occasions, \"Is the\ngame worth the candle?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX.\n\nTHE GRANTLY TRIUMPH.\n\n\nIt has been mentioned cursorily--the reader, no doubt, will have\nforgotten it--that Mrs. Grantly was not specially invited by her\nhusband to go up to town with a view of being present at Miss\nDunstable's party. Mrs. Grantly said nothing on the subject, but she\nwas somewhat chagrined; not on account of the loss she sustained with\nreference to that celebrated assembly, but because she felt that her\ndaughter's affairs required the supervision of a mother's eye. She\nalso doubted the final ratification of that Lufton-Grantly treaty,\nand, doubting it, she did not feel quite satisfied that her daughter\nshould be left in Lady Lufton's hands. She had said a word or two to\nthe archdeacon before he went up, but only a word or two, for she\nhesitated to trust him in so delicate a matter. She was, therefore,\nnot a little surprised at receiving, on the second morning after\nher husband's departure, a letter from him desiring her immediate\npresence in London. She was surprised; but her heart was filled\nrather with hope than dismay, for she had full confidence in her\ndaughter's discretion.\n\nOn the morning after the party, Lady Lufton and Griselda had\nbreakfasted together as usual, but each felt that the manner of the\nother was altered. Lady Lufton thought that her young friend was\nsomewhat less attentive, and perhaps less meek in her demeanour, than\nusual; and Griselda felt that Lady Lufton was less affectionate. Very\nlittle, however, was said between them, and Lady Lufton expressed no\nsurprise when Griselda begged to be left alone at home, instead of\naccompanying her ladyship when the carriage came to the door.\n\nNobody called in Bruton Street that afternoon--no one, at least, was\nlet in--except the archdeacon. He came there late in the day, and\nremained with his daughter till Lady Lufton returned. Then he took\nhis leave, with more abruptness than was usual with him, and without\nsaying anything special to account for the duration of his visit.\nNeither did Griselda say anything special; and so the evening wore\naway, each feeling in some unconscious manner that she was on less\nintimate terms with the other than had previously been the case.\n\nOn the next day also Griselda would not go out, but at four o'clock\na servant brought a letter to her from Mount Street. Her mother had\narrived in London and wished to see her at once. Mrs. Grantly sent\nher love to Lady Lufton, and would call at half-past five, or at any\nlater hour at which it might be convenient for Lady Lufton to see\nher. Griselda was to stay and dine in Mount Street; so said the\nletter. Lady Lufton declared that she would be very happy to see\nMrs. Grantly at the hour named; and then, armed with this message,\nGriselda started for her mother's lodgings.\n\n\"I'll send the carriage for you,\" said Lady Lufton. \"I suppose about\nten will do.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Griselda, \"that will do very nicely;\" and then she\nwent.\n\nExactly at half-past five Mrs. Grantly was shown into Lady Lufton's\ndrawing-room. Her daughter did not come with her, and Lady Lufton\ncould see by the expression of her friend's face that business was\nto be discussed. Indeed, it was necessary that she herself should\ndiscuss business, for Mrs. Grantly must now be told that the family\ntreaty could not be ratified. The gentleman declined the alliance,\nand poor Lady Lufton was uneasy in her mind at the nature of the task\nbefore her.\n\n\"Your coming up has been rather unexpected,\" said Lady Lufton, as\nsoon as her friend was seated on the sofa.\n\n\"Yes, indeed; I got a letter from the archdeacon only this morning,\nwhich made it absolutely necessary that I should come.\"\n\n\"No bad news, I hope?\" said Lady Lufton.\n\n\"No; I can't call it bad news. But, dear Lady Lufton, things won't\nalways turn out exactly as one would have them.\"\n\n\"No, indeed,\" said her ladyship, remembering that it was incumbent\non her to explain to Mrs. Grantly now at this present interview the\ntidings with which her mind was fraught. She would, however, let Mrs.\nGrantly first tell her own story, feeling, perhaps, that the one\nmight possibly bear upon the other.\n\n\"Poor dear Griselda!\" said Mrs. Grantly, almost with a sigh. \"I need\nnot tell you, Lady Lufton, what my hopes were regarding her.\"\n\n\"Has she told you anything--anything that--\"\n\n\"She would have spoken to you at once--and it was due to you that she\nshould have done so--but she was timid; and not unnaturally so. And\nthen it was right that she should see her father and me before she\nquite made up her own mind. But I may say that it is settled now.\"\n\n\"What is settled?\" asked Lady Lufton.\n\n\"Of course it is impossible for any one to tell beforehand how these\nthings will turn out,\" continued Mrs. Grantly, beating about the bush\nrather more than was necessary. \"The dearest wish of my heart was to\nsee her married to Lord Lufton. I should so much have wished to have\nher in the same county with me, and such a match as that would have\nfully satisfied my ambition.\"\n\n\"Well, I should rather think it might!\" Lady Lufton did not say this\nout loud, but she thought it. Mrs. Grantly was absolutely speaking of\na match between her daughter and Lord Lufton as though she would have\ndisplayed some amount of Christian moderation in putting up with it!\nGriselda Grantly might be a very nice girl; but even she--so thought\nLady Lufton at the moment--might possibly be priced too highly.\n\n\"Dear Mrs. Grantly,\" she said, \"I have foreseen for the last few days\nthat our mutual hopes in this respect would not be gratified. Lord\nLufton, I think;--but perhaps it is not necessary to explain-- Had\nyou not come up to town I should have written to you,--probably\nto-day. Whatever may be dear Griselda's fate in life, I sincerely\nhope that she may be happy.\"\n\n\"I think she will,\" said Mrs. Grantly, in a tone that expressed much\nsatisfaction.\n\n\"Has--has anything--\"\n\n\"Lord Dumbello proposed to Griselda the other night, at Miss\nDunstable's party,\" said Mrs. Grantly, with her eyes fixed upon\nthe floor, and assuming on the sudden much meekness in her manner;\n\"and his lordship was with the archdeacon yesterday, and again this\nmorning. I fancy he is in Mount Street at the present moment.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed!\" said Lady Lufton. She would have given worlds to have\npossessed at the moment sufficient self-command to have enabled her\nto express in her tone and manner unqualified satisfaction at the\ntidings. But she had not such self-command, and was painfully aware\nof her own deficiency.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mrs. Grantly. \"And as it is all so far settled, and as\nI know you are so kindly anxious about dear Griselda, I thought\nit right to let you know at once. Nothing can be more upright,\nhonourable, and generous, than Lord Dumbello's conduct; and, on the\nwhole, the match is one with which I and the archdeacon cannot but be\ncontented.\"\n\n\"It is certainly a great match,\" said Lady Lufton. \"Have you seen\nLady Hartletop yet?\"\n\nNow Lady Hartletop could not be regarded as an agreeable connection,\nbut this was the only word which escaped from Lady Lufton that could\nbe considered in any way disparaging, and, on the whole, I think that\nshe behaved well.\n\n\"Lord Dumbello is so completely his own master that that has not been\nnecessary,\" said Mrs. Grantly. \"The marquis has been told, and the\narchdeacon will see him either to-morrow or the day after.\"\n\nThere was nothing left for Lady Lufton but to congratulate her\nfriend, and this she did in words perhaps not very sincere, but\nwhich, on the whole, were not badly chosen.\n\n\"I am sure I hope she will be very happy,\" said Lady Lufton, \"and\nI trust that the alliance\"--the word was very agreeable to Mrs.\nGrantly's ear--\"will give unalloyed gratification to you and to her\nfather. The position which she is called to fill is a very splendid\none, but I do not think that it is above her merits.\"\n\nThis was very generous, and so Mrs. Grantly felt it. She had expected\nthat her news would be received with the coldest shade of civility,\nand she was quite prepared to do battle if there were occasion. But\nshe had no wish for war, and was almost grateful to Lady Lufton for\nher cordiality.\n\n\"Dear Lady Lufton,\" she said, \"it is so kind of you to say so. I have\ntold no one else, and of course would tell no one till you knew it.\nNo one has known her and understood her so well as you have done. And\nI can assure you of this: that there is no one to whose friendship\nshe looks forward in her new sphere of life with half so much\npleasure as she does to yours.\"\n\nLady Lufton did not say much further. She could not declare that\nshe expected much gratification from an intimacy with the future\nMarchioness of Hartletop. The Hartletops and Luftons must, at any\nrate for her generation, live in a world apart, and she had now said\nall that her old friendship with Mrs. Grantly required. Mrs. Grantly\nunderstood all this quite as well as did Lady Lufton; but then Mrs.\nGrantly was much the better woman of the world.\n\nIt was arranged that Griselda should come back to Bruton Street for\nthat night, and that her visit should then be brought to a close.\n\n\"The archdeacon thinks that for the present I had better remain up in\ntown,\" said Mrs. Grantly, \"and under the very peculiar circumstances\nGriselda will be--perhaps more comfortable with me.\"\n\nTo this Lady Lufton entirely agreed; and so they parted, excellent\nfriends, embracing each other in a most affectionate manner.\n\nThat evening Griselda did return to Bruton Street, and Lady Lufton\nhad to go through the further task of congratulating her. This was\nthe more disagreeable of the two, especially so as it had to be\nthought over beforehand. But the young lady's excellent good sense\nand sterling qualities made the task comparatively an easy one. She\nneither cried, nor was impassioned, nor went into hysterics, nor\nshowed any emotion. She did not even talk of her noble Dumbello--her\ngenerous Dumbello. She took Lady Lufton's kisses almost in silence,\nthanked her gently for her kindness, and made no allusion to her own\nfuture grandeur.\n\n\"I think I should like to go to bed early,\" she said, \"as I must see\nto my packing up.\"\n\n\"Richards will do all that for you, my dear.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, thank you, nothing can be kinder than Richards. But I'll\njust see to my own dresses.\" And so she went to bed early.\n\nLady Lufton did not see her son for the next two days, but when she\ndid, of course she said a word or two about Griselda.\n\n\"You have heard the news, Ludovic?\" she asked.\n\n\"Oh, yes: it's at all the clubs. I have been overwhelmed with\npresents of willow branches.\"\n\n\"You, at any rate, have got nothing to regret,\" she said.\n\n\"Nor you either, mother. I am sure that you do not think you have.\nSay that you do not regret it. Dearest mother, say so for my sake. Do\nyou not know in your heart of hearts that she was not suited to be\nhappy as my wife,--or to make me happy?\"\n\n\"Perhaps not,\" said Lady Lufton, sighing. And then she kissed her\nson, and declared to herself that no girl in England could be good\nenough for him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI.\n\nSALMON FISHING IN NORWAY.\n\n\nLord Dumbello's engagement with Griselda Grantly was the talk of the\ntown for the next ten days. It formed, at least, one of two subjects\nwhich monopolized attention, the other being that dreadful rumour,\nfirst put in motion by Tom Towers at Miss Dunstable's party, as to a\nthreatened dissolution of Parliament.\n\n\"Perhaps, after all, it will be the best thing for us,\" said Mr.\nGreen Walker, who felt himself to be tolerably safe at Crewe\nJunction.\n\n\"I regard it as a most wicked attempt,\" said Harold Smith, who was\nnot equally secure in his own borough, and to whom the expense of\nan election was disagreeable. \"It is done in order that they may\nget time to tide over the autumn. They won't gain ten votes by a\ndissolution, and less than forty would hardly give them a majority.\nBut they have no sense of public duty--none whatever. Indeed, I don't\nknow who has.\"\n\n\"No, by Jove; that's just it. That's what my aunt Lady Hartletop\nsays; there is no sense of duty left in the world. By-the-by, what an\nuncommon fool Dumbello is making himself!\" And then the conversation\nwent off to that other topic.\n\nLord Lufton's joke against himself about the willow branches was all\nvery well, and nobody dreamed that his heart was sore in that matter.\nThe world was laughing at Lord Dumbello for what it chose to call\na foolish match, and Lord Lufton's friends talked to him about it\nas though they had never suspected that he could have made an ass\nof himself in the same direction; but, nevertheless, he was not\naltogether contented. He by no means wished to marry Griselda; he\nhad declared to himself a dozen times since he had first suspected\nhis mother's manoeuvres, that no consideration on earth should\ninduce him to do so; he had pronounced her to be cold, insipid, and\nunattractive in spite of her beauty; and yet he felt almost angry\nthat Lord Dumbello should have been successful. And this, too,\nwas the more inexcusable, seeing that he had never forgotten Lucy\nRobarts, had never ceased to love her, and that, in holding those\nvarious conversations within his own bosom, he was as loud in Lucy's\nfavour as he was in dispraise of Griselda.\n\n\"Your hero, then,\" I hear some well-balanced critic say, \"is not\nworth very much.\"\n\nIn the first place Lord Lufton is not my hero; and in the next place,\na man may be very imperfect and yet worth a great deal. A man may be\nas imperfect as Lord Lufton, and yet worthy of a good mother and a\ngood wife. If not, how many of us are unworthy of the mothers and\nwives we have! It is my belief that few young men settle themselves\ndown to the work of the world, to the begetting of children, and\ncarving and paying and struggling and fretting for the same, without\nhaving first been in love with four or five possible mothers for\nthem, and probably with two or three at the same time. And yet these\nmen are, as a rule, worthy of the excellent wives that ultimately\nfall to their lot. In this way Lord Lufton had, to a certain extent,\nbeen in love with Griselda. There had been one moment in his life\nin which he would have offered her his hand, had not her discretion\nbeen so excellent; and though that moment never returned, still he\nsuffered from some feeling akin to disappointment when he learned\nthat Griselda had been won and was to be worn. He was, then, a dog\nin the manger, you will say. Well; and are we not all dogs in the\nmanger, more or less actively? Is not that manger-doggishness one of\nthe most common phases of the human heart?\n\nBut not the less was Lord Lufton truly in love with Lucy Robarts.\nHad he fancied that any Dumbello was carrying on a siege before\nthat fortress, his vexation would have manifested itself in a very\ndifferent manner. He could joke about Griselda Grantly with a frank\nface and a happy tone of voice; but had he heard of any tidings of a\nsimilar import with reference to Lucy, he would have been past all\njoking, and I much doubt whether it would not even have affected his\nappetite.\n\n\"Mother,\" he said to Lady Lufton a day or two after the declaration\nof Griselda's engagement, \"I am going to Norway to fish.\"\n\n\"To Norway,--to fish!\"\n\n\"Yes. We've got rather a nice party. Clontarf is going, and\nCulpepper--\"\n\n\"What, that horrid man!\"\n\n\"He's an excellent hand at fishing;--and Haddington Peebles,\nand--and--there'll be six of us altogether; and we start this day\nweek.\"\n\n\"That's rather sudden, Ludovic.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is sudden; but we're sick of London. I should not care to\ngo so soon myself, but Clontarf and Culpepper say that the season\nis early this year. I must go down to Framley before I start--about\nmy horses; and therefore I came to tell you that I shall be there\nto-morrow.\"\n\n\"At Framley to-morrow! If you could put it off for three days I\nshould be going myself.\"\n\nBut Lord Lufton could not put it off for three days. It may be that\non this occasion he did not wish for his mother's presence at Framley\nwhile he was there; that he conceived that he should be more at his\nease in giving orders about his stable if he were alone while so\nemployed. At any rate he declined her company, and on the following\nmorning did go down to Framley by himself.\n\n\"Mark,\" said Mrs. Robarts, hurrying into her husband's book-room\nabout the middle of the day, \"Lord Lufton is at home. Have you heard\nit?\"\n\n\"What! here at Framley?\"\n\n\"He is over at Framley Court; so the servants say. Carson saw him in\nthe paddock with some of the horses. Won't you go and see him?\"\n\n\"Of course I will,\" said Mark, shutting up his papers. \"Lady Lufton\ncan't be here, and if he is alone he will probably come and dine.\"\n\n\"I don't know about that,\" said Mrs. Robarts, thinking of poor Lucy.\n\n\"He is not in the least particular. What does for us will do for\nhim. I shall ask him, at any rate.\" And without further parley the\nclergyman took up his hat and went off in search of his friend.\n\nLucy Robarts had been present when the gardener brought in tidings of\nLord Lufton's arrival at Framley, and was aware that Fanny had gone\nto tell her husband.\n\n\"He won't come here, will he?\" she said, as soon as Mrs. Robarts\nreturned.\n\n\"I can't say,\" said Fanny. \"I hope not. He ought not to do so, and I\ndon't think he will. But Mark says that he will ask him to dinner.\"\n\n\"Then, Fanny, I must be taken ill. There is nothing else for it.\"\n\n\"I don't think he will come. I don't think he can be so cruel.\nIndeed, I feel sure that he won't; but I thought it right to tell\nyou.\"\n\nLucy also conceived that it was improbable that Lord Lufton should\ncome to the parsonage under the present circumstances; and she\ndeclared to herself that it would not be possible that she should\nappear at table if he did do so; but, nevertheless, the idea of his\nbeing at Framley was, perhaps, not altogether painful to her. She did\nnot recognize any pleasure as coming to her from his arrival, but\nstill there was something in his presence which was, unconsciously\nto herself, soothing to her feelings. But that terrible question\nremained;--how was she to act if it should turn out that he was\ncoming to dinner?\n\n\"If he does come, Fanny,\" she said, solemnly, after a pause, \"I must\nkeep to my own room, and leave Mark to think what he pleases. It will\nbe better for me to make a fool of myself there, than in his presence\nin the drawing-room.\"\n\nMark Robarts took his hat and stick and went over at once to the\nhome paddock, in which he knew that Lord Lufton was engaged with the\nhorses and grooms. He also was in no supremely happy frame of mind,\nfor his correspondence with Mr. Tozer was on the increase. He had\nreceived notice from that indefatigable gentleman that certain\n\"overdue bills\" were now lying at the bank in Barchester, and were\nvery desirous of his, Mr. Robarts's, notice. A concatenation of\ncertain peculiarly unfortunate circumstances made it indispensably\nnecessary that Mr. Tozer should be repaid, without further loss of\ntime, the various sums of money which he had advanced on the credit\nof Mr. Robarts's name, &c. &c. &c. No absolute threat was put forth,\nand, singular to say, no actual amount was named. Mr. Robarts,\nhowever, could not but observe, with a most painfully accurate\nattention, that mention was made, not of an overdue bill, but of\noverdue bills. What if Mr. Tozer were to demand from him the instant\nrepayment of nine hundred pounds? Hitherto he had merely written to\nMr. Sowerby, and he might have had an answer from that gentleman this\nmorning, but no such answer had as yet reached him. Consequently he\nwas not, at the present moment, in a very happy frame of mind.\n\nHe soon found himself with Lord Lufton and the horses. Four or five\nof them were being walked slowly about the paddock in the care of as\nmany men or boys, and the sheets were being taken off them--off one\nafter another, so that their master might look at them with the more\naccuracy and satisfaction. But though Lord Lufton was thus doing his\nduty, and going through his work, he was not doing it with his whole\nheart,--as the head groom perceived very well. He was fretful about\nthe nags, and seemed anxious to get them out of his sight as soon as\nhe had made a decent pretext of looking at them.\n\n\"How are you, Lufton?\" said Robarts, coming forward. \"They told me\nthat you were down, and so I came across at once.\"\n\n\"Yes; I only got here this morning, and should have been over with\nyou directly. I am going to Norway for six weeks or so, and it seems\nthat the fish are so early this year, that we must start at once. I\nhave a matter on which I want to speak to you before I leave; and,\nindeed, it was that which brought me down more than anything else.\"\n\nThere was something hurried and not altogether easy about his manner\nas he spoke, which struck Robarts, and made him think that this\npromised matter to be spoken of would not be agreeable in discussion.\nHe did not know whether Lord Lufton might not again be mixed up with\nTozer and the bills.\n\n\"You will dine with us to-day,\" he said, \"if, as I suppose, you are\nall alone.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am all alone.\"\n\n\"Then you'll come?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't quite know. No, I don't think I can go over to dinner.\nDon't look so disgusted. I'll explain it all to you just now.\"\n\nWhat could there be in the wind; and how was it possible that Tozer's\nbill should make it inexpedient for Lord Lufton to dine at the\nparsonage? Robarts, however, said nothing further about it at the\nmoment, but turned off to look at the horses.\n\n\"They are an uncommonly nice set of animals,\" said he.\n\n\"Well, yes; I don't know. When a man has four or five horses to look\nat, somehow or other he never has one fit to go. That chestnut mare\nis a picture, now that nobody wants her; but she wasn't able to carry\nme well to hounds a single day last winter. Take them in, Pounce;\nthat'll do.\"\n\n\"Won't your lordship run your eye over the old black 'oss?\" said\nPounce, the head groom, in a melancholy tone; \"he's as fine, sir--as\nfine as a stag.\"\n\n\"To tell you the truth, I think they're too fine; but that'll do;\ntake them in. And now, Mark, if you're at leisure, we'll take a turn\nround the place.\"\n\nMark, of course, was at leisure, and so they started on their walk.\n\n\"You're too difficult to please about your stable,\" Robarts began.\n\n\"Never mind the stable now,\" said Lord Lufton. \"The truth is, I am\nnot thinking about it. Mark,\" he then said, very abruptly, \"I want\nyou to be frank with me. Has your sister ever spoken to you about\nme?\"\n\n\"My sister; Lucy?\"\n\n\"Yes; your sister Lucy.\"\n\n\"No, never; at least nothing especial; nothing that I can remember at\nthis moment.\"\n\n\"Nor your wife?\"\n\n\"Spoken about you!--Fanny? Of course she has, in an ordinary way. It\nwould be impossible that she should not. But what do you mean?\"\n\n\"Have either of them told you that I made an offer to your sister?\"\n\n\"That you made an offer to Lucy?\"\n\n\"Yes, that I made an offer to Lucy.\"\n\n\"No; nobody has told me so. I have never dreamed of such a thing;\nnor, as far as I believe, have they. If anybody has spread such a\nreport, or said that either of them have hinted at such a thing, it\nis a base lie. Good heavens! Lufton, for what do you take them?\"\n\n\"But I did,\" said his lordship.\n\n\"Did what?\" said the parson.\n\n\"I did make your sister an offer.\"\n\n\"You made Lucy an offer of marriage!\"\n\n\"Yes, I did;--in as plain language as a gentleman could use to a\nlady.\"\n\n\"And what answer did she make?\"\n\n\"She refused me. And now, Mark, I have come down here with the\nexpress purpose of making that offer again. Nothing could be more\ndecided than your sister's answer. It struck me as being almost\nuncourteously decided. But still it is possible that circumstances\nmay have weighed with her, which ought not to weigh with her. If her\nlove be not given to any one else, I may still have a chance of it.\nIt's the old story of faint heart, you know: at any rate, I mean to\ntry my luck again; and thinking over it with deliberate purpose, I\nhave come to the conclusion that I ought to tell you before I see\nher.\"\n\nLord Lufton in love with Lucy! As these words repeated themselves\nover and over again within Mark Robarts's mind, his mind added\nto them notes of surprise without end. How had it possibly come\nabout,--and why? In his estimation his sister Lucy was a very simple\ngirl--not plain indeed, but by no means beautiful; certainly not\nstupid, but by no means brilliant. And then, he would have said, that\nof all men whom he knew, Lord Lufton would have been the last to\nfall in love with such a girl as his sister. And now, what was he\nto say or do? What views was he bound to hold? In what direction\nshould he act? There was Lady Lufton on the one side, to whom\nhe owed everything. How would life be possible to him in that\nparsonage--within a few yards of her elbow--if he consented to\nreceive Lord Lufton as the acknowledged suitor of his sister? It\nwould be a great match for Lucy, doubtless; but-- Indeed, he could\nnot bring himself to believe that Lucy could in truth become the\nabsolute reigning queen of Framley Court.\n\n\"Do you think that Fanny knows anything of all this?\" he said, after\na moment or two.\n\n\"I cannot possibly tell. If she does it is not with my knowledge. I\nshould have thought that you could best answer that.\"\n\n\"I cannot answer it at all,\" said Mark. \"I, at least, have had no\nremotest idea of such a thing.\"\n\n\"Your ideas of it now need not be at all remote,\" said Lord Lufton,\nwith a faint smile; \"and you may know it as a fact. I did make her an\noffer of marriage; I was refused; I am going to repeat it; and I am\nnow taking you into my confidence, in order that, as her brother, and\nas my friend, you may give me such assistance as you can.\" They then\nwalked on in silence for some yards, after which Lord Lufton added:\n\"And now I'll dine with you to-day if you wish it.\"\n\nMr. Robarts did not know what to say; he could not bethink himself\nwhat answer duty required of him. He had no right to interfere\nbetween his sister and such a marriage, if she herself should wish\nit; but still there was something terrible in the thought of it! He\nhad a vague conception that it must come to evil; that the project\nwas a dangerous one; and that it could not finally result happily for\nany of them. What would Lady Lufton say? That undoubtedly was the\nchief source of his dismay.\n\n\"Have you spoken to your mother about this?\" he said.\n\n\"My mother? no; why speak to her till I know my fate? A man does not\nlike to speak much of such matters if there be a probability of his\nbeing rejected. I tell you because I do not like to make my way into\nyour house under a false pretence.\"\n\n\"But what would Lady Lufton say?\"\n\n\"I think it probable that she would be displeased on the first\nhearing it; that in four-and-twenty hours she would be reconciled;\nand that after a week or so Lucy would be her dearest favourite and\nthe prime minister of all her machinations. You don't know my mother\nas well as I do. She would give her head off her shoulders to do me a\npleasure.\"\n\n\"And for that reason,\" said Mark Robarts, \"you ought, if possible, to\ndo her pleasure.\"\n\n\"I cannot absolutely marry a wife of her choosing, if you mean that,\"\nsaid Lord Lufton.\n\nThey went on walking about the garden for an hour, but they hardly\ngot any farther than the point to which we have now brought them.\nMark Robarts could not make up his mind on the spur of the moment;\nnor, as he said more than once to Lord Lufton, could he be at all\nsure that Lucy would in any way be guided by him. It was, therefore,\nat last settled between them that Lord Lufton should come to the\nparsonage immediately after breakfast on the following morning. It\nwas agreed also that the dinner had better not come off, and Robarts\npromised that he would, if possible, have determined by the morning\nas to what advice he would give his sister.\n\nHe went direct home to the parsonage from Framley Court, feeling that\nhe was altogether in the dark till he should have consulted his wife.\nHow would he feel if Lucy were to become Lady Lufton? and how would\nhe look Lady Lufton in the face in telling her that such was to be\nhis sister's destiny? On returning home he immediately found his\nwife, and had not been closeted with her five minutes before he knew,\nat any rate, all that she knew.\n\n\"And you mean to say that she does love him?\" said Mark.\n\n\"Indeed she does; and is it not natural that she should? When I saw\nthem so much together I feared that she would. But I never thought\nthat he would care for her.\"\n\nEven Fanny did not as yet give Lucy credit for half her\nattractiveness. After an hour's talking the interview between the\nhusband and wife ended in a message to Lucy, begging her to join them\nboth in the book-room.\n\n\"Aunt Lucy,\" said a chubby little darling, who was taken up into his\naunt's arms as he spoke, \"papa and mamma 'ant 'oo in te tuddy, and I\nmusn't go wis 'oo.\"\n\nLucy, as she kissed the boy and pressed his face against her own,\nfelt that her blood was running quick to her heart.\n\n\"Musn't 'oo go wis me, my own one?\" she said, as she put her\nplayfellow down; but she played with the child only because she\ndid not wish to betray even to him that she was hardly mistress of\nherself. She knew that Lord Lufton was at Framley; she knew that her\nbrother had been to him; she knew that a proposal had been made that\nhe should come there that day to dinner. Must it not therefore be the\ncase that this call to a meeting in the study had arisen out of Lord\nLufton's arrival at Framley? and yet, how could it have done so? Had\nFanny betrayed her in order to prevent the dinner invitation? It\ncould not be possible that Lord Lufton himself should have spoken on\nthe subject! And then she again stooped to kiss the child, rubbed\nher hands across her forehead to smooth her hair, and erase, if\nthat might be possible, the look of care which she wore, and then\ndescended slowly to her brother's sitting-room.\n\nHer hand paused for a second on the door ere she opened it, but she\nhad resolved that, come what might, she would be brave. She pushed it\nopen and walked in with a bold front, with eyes wide open, and a slow\nstep.\n\n\"Frank says that you want me,\" she said.\n\nMr. Robarts and Fanny were both standing up by the fireplace, and\neach waited a second for the other to speak when Lucy entered the\nroom; and then Fanny began,--\n\n\"Lord Lufton is here, Lucy.\"\n\n\"Here! Where? At the parsonage?\"\n\n\"No, not at the parsonage; but over at Framley Court,\" said Mark.\n\n\"And he promises to call here after breakfast to-morrow,\" said Fanny.\nAnd then again there was a pause. Mrs. Robarts hardly dared to look\nLucy in the face. She had not betrayed her trust, seeing that the\nsecret had been told to Mark, not by her, but by Lord Lufton; but she\ncould not but feel that Lucy would think that she had betrayed it.\n\n\"Very well,\" said Lucy, trying to smile; \"I have no objection in\nlife.\"\n\n\"But, Lucy, dear,\"--and now Mrs. Robarts put her arm round her\nsister-in-law's waist,--\"he is coming here especially to see you.\"\n\n\"Oh; that makes a difference. I am afraid that I shall be--engaged.\"\n\n\"He has told everything to Mark,\" said Mrs. Robarts.\n\nLucy now felt that her bravery was almost deserting her. She hardly\nknew which way to look or how to stand. Had Fanny told everything\nalso? There was so much that Fanny knew that Lord Lufton could not\nhave known. But, in truth, Fanny had told all--the whole story of\nLucy's love, and had described the reasons which had induced her to\nreject her suitor; and had done so in words which, had Lord Lufton\nheard them, would have made him twice as passionate in his love.\n\nAnd then it certainly did occur to Lucy to think why Lord Lufton\nshould have come to Framley and told all this history to her brother.\nShe attempted for a moment to make herself believe that she was angry\nwith him for doing so. But she was not angry. She had not time to\nargue much about it, but there came upon her a gratified sensation of\nhaving been remembered, and thought of, and--loved. Must it not be\nso? Could it be possible that he himself would have told this tale to\nher brother, if he did not still love her? Fifty times she had said\nto herself that his offer had been an affair of the moment, and fifty\ntimes she had been unhappy in so saying. But this new coming of his\ncould not be an affair of the moment. She had been the dupe, she had\nthought, of an absurd passion on her own part; but now--how was it\nnow? She did not bring herself to think that she should ever be Lady\nLufton. She had still, in some perversely obstinate manner, made up\nher mind against that result. But yet, nevertheless, it did in some\nunaccountable manner satisfy her to feel that Lord Lufton had himself\ncome down to Framley and himself told this story.\n\n\"He has told everything to Mark,\" said Mrs. Robarts; and then again\nthere was a pause for a moment, during which these thoughts passed\nthrough Lucy's mind.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mark, \"he has told me all, and he is coming here\nto-morrow morning that he may receive an answer from yourself.\"\n\n\"What answer?\" said Lucy, trembling.\n\n\"Nay, dearest; who can say that but yourself?\" and her sister-in-law,\nas she spoke, pressed close against her. \"You must say that\nyourself.\"\n\nMrs. Robarts in her long conversation with her husband had pleaded\nstrongly on Lucy's behalf, taking, as it were, a part against Lady\nLufton. She had said that if Lord Lufton persevered in his suit, they\nat the parsonage could not be justified in robbing Lucy of all that\nshe had won for herself, in order to do Lady Lufton's pleasure.\n\n\"But she will think,\" said Mark, \"that we have plotted and intrigued\nfor this. She will call us ungrateful, and will make Lucy's life\nwretched.\" To which the wife had answered, that all that must be\nleft in God's hands. They had not plotted or intrigued. Lucy, though\nloving the man in her heart of hearts, had already once refused him,\nbecause she would not be thought to have snatched at so great a\nprize. But if Lord Lufton loved her so warmly that he had come down\nthere in this manner, on purpose, as he himself had put it, that he\nmight learn his fate, then--so argued Mrs. Robarts--they two, let\ntheir loyalty to Lady Lufton be ever so strong, could not justify it\nto their consciences to stand between Lucy and her lover. Mark had\nstill somewhat demurred to this, suggesting how terrible would be\ntheir plight if they should now encourage Lord Lufton, and if he,\nafter such encouragement, when they should have quarrelled with Lady\nLufton, should allow himself to be led away from his engagement by\nhis mother. To which Fanny had answered that justice was justice, and\nthat right was right. Everything must be told to Lucy, and she must\njudge for herself.\n\n\"But I do not know what Lord Lufton wants,\" said Lucy, with her eyes\nfixed upon the ground, and now trembling more than ever. \"He did come\nto me, and I did give him an answer.\"\n\n\"And is that answer to be final?\" said Mark,--somewhat cruelly, for\nLucy had not yet been told that her lover had made any repetition of\nhis proposal. Fanny, however, determined that no injustice should be\ndone, and therefore she at last continued the story.\n\n\"We know that you did give him an answer, dearest; but gentlemen\nsometimes will not put up with one answer on such a subject. Lord\nLufton has declared to Mark that he means to ask again. He has come\ndown here on purpose to do so.\"\n\n\"And Lady Lufton--\" said Lucy, speaking hardly above a whisper, and\nstill hiding her face as she leaned against her sister's shoulder.\n\n\"Lord Lufton has not spoken to his mother about it,\" said Mark; and\nit immediately became clear to Lucy, from the tone of her brother's\nvoice, that he, at least, would not be pleased, should she accept her\nlover's vow.\n\n\"You must decide out of your own heart, dear,\" said Fanny,\ngenerously. \"Mark and I know how well you have behaved, for I have\ntold him everything.\" Lucy shuddered and leaned closer against her\nsister as this was said to her. \"I had no alternative, dearest, but\nto tell him. It was best so; was it not? But nothing has been told\nto Lord Lufton. Mark would not let him come here to-day, because it\nwould have flurried you, and he wished to give you time to think.\nBut you can see him to-morrow morning,--can you not? and then answer\nhim.\"\n\nLucy now stood perfectly silent, feeling that she dearly loved her\nsister-in-law for her sisterly kindness--for that sisterly wish to\npromote a sister's love; but still there was in her mind a strong\nresolve not to allow Lord Lufton to come there under the idea that\nhe would be received as a favoured lover. Her love was powerful, but\nso also was her pride; and she could not bring herself to bear the\nscorn which would lay in Lady Lufton's eyes. \"His mother will despise\nme, and then he will despise me too,\" she said to herself; and with\na strong gulp of disappointed love and ambition she determined to\npersist.\n\n\"Shall we leave you now, dear; and speak of it again to-morrow\nmorning, before he comes?\" said Fanny.\n\n\"That will be the best,\" said Mark. \"Turn it in your mind every way\nto-night. Think of it when you have said your prayers--and, Lucy,\ncome here to me;\"--then, taking her in his arms, he kissed her with a\ntenderness that was not customary with him towards her. \"It is fair,\"\nsaid he, \"that I should tell you this: that I have perfect confidence\nin your judgment and feeling; and that I will stand by you as your\nbrother in whatever decision you may come to. Fanny and I both think\nthat you have behaved excellently, and are both of us sure that you\nwill do what is best. Whatever you do I will stick to you;--and so\nwill Fanny.\"\n\n\"Dearest, dearest Mark!\"\n\n\"And now we will say nothing more about it till to-morrow morning,\"\nsaid Fanny.\n\nBut Lucy felt that this saying nothing more about it till to-morrow\nmorning would be tantamount to an acceptance on her part of Lord\nLufton's offer. Mrs. Robarts knew, and Mr. Robarts also now knew, the\nsecret of her heart; and if, such being the case, she allowed Lord\nLufton to come there with the acknowledged purpose of pleading his\nown suit, it would be impossible for her not to yield. If she were\nresolved that she would not yield, now was the time for her to stand\nher ground and make her fight.\n\n\"Do not go, Fanny; at least not quite yet,\" she said.\n\n\"Well, dear?\"\n\n\"I want you to stay while I tell Mark. He must not let Lord Lufton\ncome here to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Not let him!\" said Mrs. Robarts.\n\nMr. Robarts said nothing, but he felt that his sister was rising in\nhis esteem from minute to minute.\n\n\"No; Mark must bid him not come. He will not wish to pain me when it\ncan do no good. Look here, Mark;\" and she walked over to her brother,\nand put both her hands upon his arm. \"I do love Lord Lufton. I had no\nsuch meaning or thought when I first knew him. But I do love him--I\nlove him dearly;--almost as well as Fanny loves you, I suppose. You\nmay tell him so if you think proper--nay, you must tell him so, or he\nwill not understand me. But tell him this, as coming from me: that I\nwill never marry him, unless his mother asks me.\"\n\n\"She will not do that, I fear,\" said Mark, sorrowfully.\n\n\"No; I suppose not,\" said Lucy, now regaining all her courage.\n\"If I thought it probable that she should wish me to be her\ndaughter-in-law, it would not be necessary that I should make such a\nstipulation. It is because she will not wish it; because she would\nregard me as unfit to--to--to mate with her son. She would hate me,\nand scorn me; and then he would begin to scorn me, and perhaps would\ncease to love me. I could not bear her eye upon me, if she thought\nthat I had injured her son. Mark, you will go to him now; will you\nnot? and explain this to him;--as much of it as is necessary. Tell\nhim, that if his mother asks me I will--consent. But that as I know\nthat she never will, he is to look upon all that he has said as\nforgotten. With me it shall be the same as though it were forgotten.\"\n\nSuch was her verdict, and so confident were they both of her\nfirmness--of her obstinacy Mark would have called it on any other\noccasion,--that they, neither of them, sought to make her alter it.\n\n\"You will go to him now,--this afternoon; will you not?\" she said;\nand Mark promised that he would. He could not but feel that he\nhimself was greatly relieved. Lady Lufton might probably hear that\nher son had been fool enough to fall in love with the parson's\nsister, but under existing circumstances she could not consider\nherself aggrieved either by the parson or by his sister. Lucy was\nbehaving well, and Mark was proud of her. Lucy was behaving with\nfierce spirit, and Fanny was grieving for her.\n\n\"I'd rather be by myself till dinner-time,\" said Lucy, as Mrs.\nRobarts prepared to go with her out of the room. \"Dear Fanny, don't\nlook unhappy; there's nothing to make us unhappy. I told you I should\nwant goat's milk, and that will be all.\"\n\nRobarts, after sitting for an hour with his wife, did return again to\nFramley Court; and, after a considerable search, found Lord Lufton\nreturning home to a late dinner.\n\n\"Unless my mother asks her,\" said he, when the story had been told\nhim. \"That is nonsense. Surely you told her that such is not the way\nof the world.\"\n\nRobarts endeavoured to explain to him that Lucy could not endure to\nthink that her husband's mother should look on her with disfavour.\n\n\"Does she think that my mother dislikes her--her specially?\" asked\nLord Lufton.\n\nNo; Robarts could not suppose that that was the case; but Lady Lufton\nmight probably think that a marriage with a clergyman's sister would\nbe a m\u00c3\u00a9salliance.\n\n\"That is out of the question,\" said Lord Lufton; \"as she has\nespecially wanted me to marry a clergyman's daughter for some time\npast. But, Mark, it is absurd talking about my mother. A man in these\ndays is not to marry as his mother bids him.\"\n\nMark could only assure him, in answer to all this, that Lucy was very\nfirm in what she was doing, that she had quite made up her mind, and\nthat she altogether absolved Lord Lufton from any necessity to speak\nto his mother, if he did not think well of doing so. But all this was\nto very little purpose.\n\n\"She does love me then?\" said Lord Lufton.\n\n\"Well,\" said Mark, \"I will not say whether she does or does not. I\ncan only repeat her own message. She cannot accept you, unless she\ndoes so at your mother's request.\" And having said that again, he\ntook his leave, and went back to the parsonage.\n\nPoor Lucy, having finished her interview with so much dignity, having\nfully satisfied her brother, and declined any immediate consolation\nfrom her sister-in-law, betook herself to her own bed-room. She had\nto think over what she had said and done, and it was necessary that\nshe should be alone to do so. It might be that, when she came to\nreconsider the matter, she would not be quite so well satisfied\nas was her brother. Her grandeur of demeanour and slow propriety\nof carriage lasted her till she was well into her own room. There\nare animals who, when they are ailing in any way, contrive to hide\nthemselves, ashamed, as it were, that the weakness of their suffering\nshould be witnessed. Indeed, I am not sure whether all dumb animals\ndo not do so more or less; and in this respect Lucy was like a dumb\nanimal. Even in her confidences with Fanny she made a joke of her own\nmisfortunes, and spoke of her heart ailments with self-ridicule. But\nnow, having walked up the staircase with no hurried step, and having\ndeliberately locked the door, she turned herself round to suffer in\nsilence and solitude--as do the beasts and birds.\n\nShe sat herself down on a low chair, which stood at the foot of her\nbed, and, throwing back her head, held her handkerchief across her\neyes and forehead, holding it tight in both her hands; and then she\nbegan to think. She began to think and also to cry, for the tears\ncame running down from beneath the handkerchief; and low sobs were to\nbe heard,--only that the animal had taken itself off, to suffer in\nsolitude.\n\nHad she not thrown from her all her chances of happiness? Was it\npossible that he should come to her yet again,--a third time? No;\nit was not possible. The very mode and pride of this, her second\nrejection of him, made it impossible. In coming to her determination,\nand making her avowal, she had been actuated by the knowledge that\nLady Lufton would regard such a marriage with abhorrence. Lady Lufton\nwould not and could not ask her to condescend to be her son's bride.\nHer chance of happiness, of glory, of ambition, of love, was all\ngone. She had sacrificed everything, not to virtue, but to pride;\nand she had sacrificed not only herself, but him. When first he came\nthere--when she had meditated over his first visit--she had hardly\ngiven him credit for deep love; but now--there could be no doubt that\nhe loved her now. After his season in London, his days and nights\npassed with all that was beautiful, he had returned there, to that\nlittle country parsonage, that he might again throw himself at her\nfeet. And she--she had refused to see him, though she loved him with\nall her heart; she had refused to see him, because she was so vile a\ncoward that she could not bear the sour looks of an old woman!\n\n\"I will come down directly,\" she said, when Fanny at last knocked at\nthe door, begging to be admitted. \"I won't open it, love, but I will\nbe with you in ten minutes; I will, indeed.\" And so she was; not,\nperhaps, without traces of tears, discernible by the experienced eye\nof Mrs. Robarts, but yet with a smooth brow, and voice under her own\ncommand.\n\n\"I wonder whether she really loves him,\" Mark said to his wife that\nnight.\n\n\"Love him!\" his wife had answered; \"indeed she does; and, Mark, do\nnot be led away by the stern quiet of her demeanour. To my thinking\nshe is a girl who might almost die for love.\"\n\nOn the next day Lord Lufton left Framley; and started, according to\nhis arrangements, for the Norway salmon fishing.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII.\n\nTHE GOAT AND COMPASSES.\n\n\nHarold Smith had been made unhappy by that rumour of a dissolution;\nbut the misfortune to him would be as nothing compared to the\nseverity with which it would fall on Mr. Sowerby. Harold Smith might\nor might not lose his borough, but Mr. Sowerby would undoubtedly lose\nhis county; and, in losing that, he would lose everything. He felt\nvery certain now that the duke would not support him again, let who\nwould be master of Chaldicotes; and as he reflected on these things\nhe found it very hard to keep up his spirits.\n\nTom Towers, it seems, had known all about it, as he always does. The\nlittle remark which had dropped from him at Miss Dunstable's, made,\nno doubt, after mature deliberation, and with profound political\nmotives, was the forerunner, only by twelve hours, of a very general\nreport that the giants were going to the country. It was manifest\nthat the giants had not a majority in Parliament, generous as had\nbeen the promises of support disinterestedly made to them by the\ngods. This indeed was manifest, and therefore they were going to\nthe country, although they had been deliberately warned by a very\nprominent scion of Olympus that if they did do so that disinterested\nsupport must be withdrawn. This threat did not seem to weigh much,\nand by two o'clock on the day following Miss Dunstable's party, the\nfiat was presumed to have gone forth. The rumour had begun with Tom\nTowers, but by that time it had reached Buggins at the Petty Bag\nOffice.\n\n\"It won't make no difference to hus, sir; will it, Mr. Robarts?\" said\nBuggins, as he leaned respectfully against the wall near the door, in\nthe room of the private secretary at that establishment.\n\nA good deal of conversation, miscellaneous, special, and political,\nwent on between young Robarts and Buggins in the course of the day;\nas was natural, seeing that they were thrown in these evil times very\nmuch upon each other. The Lord Petty Bag of the present ministry was\nnot such a one as Harold Smith. He was a giant indifferent to his\nprivate notes, and careless as to the duties even of patronage; he\nrarely visited the office, and as there were no other clerks in the\nestablishment--owing to a root and branch reform carried out in the\nshort reign of Harold Smith--to whom could young Robarts talk, if not\nto Buggins?\n\n\"No; I suppose not,\" said Robarts, as he completed on his\nblotting-paper an elaborate picture of a Turk seated on his divan.\n\n\"'Cause, you see, sir, we're in the Upper 'Ouse, now;--as I always\nthinks we hought to be. I don't think it ain't constitutional for\nthe Petty Bag to be in the Commons, Mr. Robarts. Hany ways, it never\nusen't.\"\n\n\"They're changing all those sort of things now-a-days, Buggins,\" said\nRobarts, giving the final touch to the Turk's smoke.\n\n\"Well; I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Robarts: I think I'll go. I\ncan't stand all these changes. I'm turned of sixty now, and don't\nwant any 'stifflicates. I think I'll take my pension and walk. The\nhoffice ain't the same place at all since it come down among the\nCommons.\" And then Buggins retired sighing, to console himself with a\npot of porter behind a large open office ledger, set up on end on a\nsmall table in the little lobby outside the private secretary's room.\nBuggins sighed again as he saw that the date made visible in the open\nbook was almost as old as his own appointment; for such a book as\nthis lasted long in the Petty Bag Office. A peer of high degree had\nbeen Lord Petty Bag in those days; one whom a messenger's heart could\nrespect with infinite veneration, as he made his unaccustomed visits\nto the office with much solemnity--perhaps four times during the\nseason. The Lord Petty Bag then was highly regarded by his staff, and\nhis coming among them was talked about for some hours previously and\nfor some days afterwards; but Harold Smith had bustled in and out\nlike the managing clerk in a Manchester house. \"The service is going\nto the dogs,\" said Buggins to himself, as he put down the porter pot\nand looked up over the book at a gentleman who presented himself at\nthe door.\n\n\"Mr. Robarts in his room?\" said Buggins, repeating the gentleman's\nwords. \"Yes, Mr. Sowerby; you'll find him there; first door to the\nleft.\" And then, remembering that the visitor was a county member--a\nposition which Buggins regarded as next to that of a peer--he got up,\nand, opening the private secretary's door, ushered in the visitor.\n\nYoung Robarts and Mr. Sowerby had, of course, become acquainted\nin the days of Harold Smith's reign. During that short time the\nmember for East Barset had on most days dropped in at the Petty Bag\nOffice for a minute or two, finding out what the energetic cabinet\nminister was doing, chatting on semi-official subjects, and teaching\nthe private secretary to laugh at his master. There was nothing,\ntherefore, in his present visit which need appear to be singular, or\nwhich required any immediate special explanation. He sat himself down\nin his ordinary way, and began to speak of the subject of the day.\n\n\"We're all to go,\" said Sowerby.\n\n\"So I hear,\" said the private secretary. \"It will give me no trouble,\nfor, as the respectable Buggins says, we're in the Upper House now.\"\n\n\"What a delightful time those lucky dogs of lords do have!\" said\nSowerby. \"No constituents, no turning out, no fighting, no necessity\nfor political opinions,--and, as a rule, no such opinions at all!\"\n\n\"I suppose you're tolerably safe in East Barsetshire?\" said Robarts.\n\"The duke has it pretty much his own way there.\"\n\n\"Yes; the duke does have it pretty much his own way. By-the-by, where\nis your brother?\"\n\n\"At home,\" said Robarts; \"at least I presume so.\"\n\n\"At Framley or at Barchester? I believe he was in residence at\nBarchester not long since.\"\n\n\"He's at Framley now, I know. I got a letter only yesterday from\nhis wife, with a commission. He was there, and Lord Lufton had just\nleft.\"\n\n\"Yes; Lufton was down. He started for Norway this morning. I want to\nsee your brother. You have not heard from him yourself, have you?\"\n\n\"No; not lately. Mark is a bad correspondent. He would not do at all\nfor a private secretary.\"\n\n\"At any rate, not to Harold Smith. But you are sure I should not\ncatch him at Barchester?\"\n\n\"Send down by telegraph, and he would meet you.\"\n\n\"I don't want to do that. A telegraph message makes such a fuss in\nthe country, frightening people's wives, and setting all the horses\nabout the place galloping.\"\n\n\"What is it about?\"\n\n\"Nothing of any great consequence. I didn't know whether he might\nhave told you. I'll write down by to-night's post, and then he can\nmeet me at Barchester to-morrow. Or do you write. There's nothing\nI hate so much as letter-writing;--just tell him that I called,\nand that I shall be much obliged if he can meet me at the Dragon of\nWantly--say at two to-morrow. I will go down by the express.\"\n\nMark Robarts, in talking over this coming money trouble with Sowerby,\nhad once mentioned that if it were necessary to take up the bill for\na short time he might be able to borrow the money from his brother.\nSo much of the father's legacy still remained in the hands of the\nprivate secretary as would enable him to produce the amount of the\nlatter bill, and there could be no doubt that he would lend it if\nasked. Mr. Sowerby's visit to the Petty Bag Office had been caused by\na desire to learn whether any such request had been made,--and also\nby a half-formed resolution to make the request himself if he should\nfind that the clergyman had not done so. It seemed to him to be\na pity that such a sum should be lying about, as it were, within\nreach, and that he should not stoop to put his hands upon it. Such\nabstinence would be so contrary to all the practice of his life that\nit was as difficult to him as it is for a sportsman to let pass a\ncock-pheasant. But yet something like remorse touched his heart as he\nsat there balancing himself on his chair in the private secretary's\nroom, and looking at the young man's open face.\n\n\"Yes; I'll write to him,\" said John Robarts; \"but he hasn't said\nanything to me about anything particular.\"\n\n\"Hasn't he? It does not much signify. I only mentioned it because I\nthought I understood him to say that he would.\" And then Mr. Sowerby\nwent on swinging himself. How was it that he felt so averse to\nmention that little sum of \u00c2\u00a3500 to a young man like John Robarts,\na fellow without wife or children or calls on him of any sort, who\nwould not even be injured by the loss of the money, seeing that\nhe had an ample salary on which to live? He wondered at his own\nweakness. The want of the money was urgent on him in the extreme. He\nhad reasons for supposing that Mark would find it very difficult to\nrenew the bills, but he, Sowerby, could stop their presentation if he\ncould get this money at once into his own hands.\n\n\"Can I do anything for you?\" said the innocent lamb, offering his\nthroat to the butcher.\n\nBut some unwonted feeling numbed the butcher's fingers, and blunted\nhis knife. He sat still for half a minute after the question, and\nthen jumping from his seat, declined the offer. \"No, no; nothing,\nthank you. Only write to Mark, and say that I shall be there\nto-morrow,\" and then, taking his hat, he hurried out of the office.\n\"What an ass I am,\" he said to himself as he went: \"as if it were of\nany use now to be particular!\"\n\nHe then got into a cab and had himself driven half way up Portman\nStreet towards the New Road, and walking from thence a few hundred\nyards down a cross-street he came to a public-house. It was called\nthe \"Goat and Compasses,\"--a very meaningless name, one would say;\nbut the house boasted of being a place of public entertainment very\nlong established on that site, having been a tavern out in the\ncountry in the days of Cromwell. At that time the pious landlord,\nputting up a pious legend for the benefit of his pious customers, had\ndeclared that--\"God encompasseth us.\" The \"Goat and Compasses\" in\nthese days does quite as well; and, considering the present character\nof the house, was perhaps less unsuitable than the old legend.\n\n\"Is Mr. Austen here?\" asked Mr. Sowerby of the man at the bar.\n\n\"Which on 'em? Not Mr. John; he ain't here. Mr. Tom is in--the little\nroom on the left-hand side.\" The man whom Mr. Sowerby would have\npreferred to see was the elder brother, John; but as he was not to\nbe found, he did go into the little room. In that room he found--Mr.\nAusten, Junior, according to one arrangement of nomenclature, and Mr.\nTom Tozer according to another. To gentlemen of the legal profession\nhe generally chose to introduce himself as belonging to the\nrespectable family of the Austens; but among his intimates he had\nalways been--Tozer.\n\nMr. Sowerby, though he was intimate with the family, did not love\nthe Tozers; but he especially hated Tom Tozer. Tom Tozer was a\nbull-necked, beetle-browed fellow, the expression of whose face was\neloquent with acknowledged roguery. \"I am a rogue,\" it seemed to say.\n\"I know it; all the world knows it: but you're another. All the world\ndon't know that, but I do. Men are all rogues, pretty nigh. Some are\nsoft rogues, and some are 'cute rogues. I am a 'cute one; so mind\nyour eye.\" It was with such words that Tom Tozer's face spoke out;\nand though a thorough liar in his heart, he was not a liar in his\nface.\n\n\"Well, Tozer,\" said Mr. Sowerby, absolutely shaking hands with the\ndirty miscreant, \"I wanted to see your brother.\"\n\n\"John ain't here, and ain't like; but it's all as one.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes; I suppose it is. I know you two hunt in couples.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you mean about hunting, Mr. Sowerby. You gents 'as\nall the hunting, and we poor folk 'as all the work. I hope you're\ngoing to make up this trifle of money we're out of so long.\"\n\n\"It's about that I've called. I don't know what you call long, Tozer;\nbut the last bill was only dated in February.\"\n\n\"It's overdue; ain't it?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; it's overdue. There's no doubt about that.\"\n\n\"Well; when a bit of paper is come round, the next thing is to take\nit up. Them's my ideas. And to tell you the truth, Mr. Sowerby, we\ndon't think as 'ow you've been treating us just on the square lately.\nIn that matter of Lord Lufton's you was down on us uncommon.\"\n\n\"You know I couldn't help myself.\"\n\n\"Well; and we can't help ourselves now. That's where it is, Mr.\nSowerby. Lord love you; we know what's what, we do. And so, the fact\nis we're uncommon low as to the ready just at present, and we must\nhave them few hundred pounds. We must have them at once, or we must\nsell up that clerical gent. I'm dashed if it ain't as hard to get\nmoney from a parson as it is to take a bone from a dog. 'E's 'ad 'is\naccount, no doubt, and why don't 'e pay?\"\n\nMr. Sowerby had called with the intention of explaining that he was\nabout to proceed to Barchester on the following day with the express\nview of \"making arrangements\" about this bill; and had he seen John\nTozer, John would have been compelled to accord to him some little\nextension of time. Both Tom and John knew this; and, therefore,\nJohn--the soft-hearted one--kept out of the way. There was no danger\nthat Tom would be weak; and, after some half-hour of parley, he was\nagain left by Mr. Sowerby, without having evinced any symptom of\nweakness.\n\n\"It's the dibs as we want, Mr. Sowerby; that's all,\" were the last\nwords which he spoke as the member of Parliament left the room.\n\nMr. Sowerby then got into another cab, and had himself driven to his\nsister's house. It is a remarkable thing with reference to men who\nare distressed for money--distressed as was now the case with Mr.\nSowerby--that they never seem at a loss for small sums, or deny\nthemselves those luxuries which small sums purchase. Cabs, dinners,\nwine, theatres, and new gloves are always at the command of men who\nare drowned in pecuniary embarrassments, whereas those who don't owe\na shilling are so frequently obliged to go without them! It would\nseem that there is no gratification so costly as that of keeping out\nof debt. But then it is only fair that, if a man has a hobby, he\nshould pay for it.\n\nAny one else would have saved his shilling, as Mrs. Harold Smith's\nhouse was only just across Oxford Street, in the neighbourhood of\nHanover Square; but Mr. Sowerby never thought of this. He had never\nsaved a shilling in his life, and it did not occur to him to begin\nnow. He had sent word to her to remain at home for him, and he now\nfound her waiting.\n\n\"Harriet,\" said he, throwing himself back into an easy chair, \"the\ngame is pretty well up at last.\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" said she. \"The game is not up at all if you have the\nspirit to carry it on.\"\n\n\"I can only say that I got a formal notice this morning from the\nduke's lawyer, saying that he meant to foreclose at once;--not from\nFothergill, but from those people in South Audley Street.\"\n\n\"You expected that,\" said his sister.\n\n\"I don't see how that makes it any better; besides, I am not quite\nsure that I did expect it; at any rate I did not feel certain. There\nis no doubt now.\"\n\n\"It is better that there should be no doubt. It is much better that\nyou should know on what ground you have to stand.\"\n\n\"I shall soon have no ground to stand on, none at least of my\nown,--not an acre,\" said the unhappy man, with great bitterness in\nhis tone.\n\n\"You can't in reality be poorer now than you were last year. You\nhave not spent anything to speak of. There can be no doubt that\nChaldicotes will be ample to pay all you owe the duke.\"\n\n\"It's as much as it will; and what am I to do then? I almost think\nmore of the seat than I do of Chaldicotes.\"\n\n\"You know what I advise,\" said Mrs. Smith. \"Ask Miss Dunstable to\nadvance the money on the same security which the duke holds. She will\nbe as safe then as he is now. And if you can arrange that, stand for\nthe county against him; perhaps you may be beaten.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't have a chance.\"\n\n\"But it would show that you are not a creature in the duke's hands.\nThat's my advice,\" said Mrs. Smith, with much spirit; \"and if you\nwish, I'll broach it to Miss Dunstable, and ask her to get her lawyer\nto look into it.\"\n\n\"If I had done this before I had run my head into that other\nabsurdity!\"\n\n\"Don't fret yourself about that; she will lose nothing by such an\ninvestment, and therefore you are not asking any favour of her.\nBesides, did she not make the offer? and she is just the woman to do\nthis for you now, because she refused to do that other thing for you\nyesterday. You understand most things, Nathaniel; but I am not sure\nthat you understand women; not, at any rate, such a woman as her.\"\n\nIt went against the grain with Mr. Sowerby, this seeking of pecuniary\nassistance from the very woman whose hand he had attempted to gain\nabout a fortnight since; but he allowed his sister to prevail. What\ncould any man do in such straits that would not go against the grain?\nAt the present moment he felt in his mind an infinite hatred against\nthe duke, Mr. Fothergill, Gumption and Gagebee, and all the tribes\nof Gatherum Castle and South Audley Street; they wanted to rob him\nof that which had belonged to the Sowerbys before the name of Omnium\nhad been heard of in the county, or in England! The great leviathan\nof the deep was anxious to swallow him up as a prey! He was to be\nswallowed up, and made away with, and put out of sight, without a\npang of remorse! Any measure which could now present itself as the\nmeans of staving off so evil a day would be acceptable; and therefore\nhe gave his sister the commission of making this second proposal\nto Miss Dunstable. In cursing the duke--for he did curse the duke\nlustily--it hardly occurred to him to think that, after all, the duke\nonly asked for his own.\n\nAs for Mrs. Harold Smith, whatever may be the view taken of her\ngeneral character as a wife and a member of society, it must be\nadmitted that as a sister she had virtues.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\n\nCONSOLATION.\n\n\nOn the next day, at two o'clock punctually, Mark Robarts was at the\n\"Dragon of Wantly,\" walking up and down the very room in which the\nparty had breakfasted after Harold Smith's lecture, and waiting for\nthe arrival of Mr. Sowerby. He had been very well able to divine what\nwas the business on which his friend wished to see him, and he had\nbeen rather glad than otherwise to receive the summons. Judging of\nhis friend's character by what he had hitherto seen, he thought that\nMr. Sowerby would have kept out of the way, unless he had it in his\npower to make some provision for these terrible bills. So he walked\nup and down the dingy room, impatient for the expected arrival, and\nthought himself wickedly ill-used in that Mr. Sowerby was not there\nwhen the clock struck a quarter to three. But when the clock struck\nthree, Mr. Sowerby was there, and Mark Robarts's hopes were nearly at\nan end.\n\n\"Do you mean that they will demand nine hundred pounds?\" said\nRobarts, standing up and glaring angrily at the member of Parliament.\n\n\"I fear that they will,\" said Sowerby. \"I think it is best to tell\nyou the worst, in order that we may see what can be done.\"\n\n\"I can do nothing, and will do nothing,\" said Robarts. \"They may do\nwhat they choose--what the law allows them.\"\n\nAnd then he thought of Fanny and his nursery, and Lucy refusing in\nher pride Lord Lufton's offer, and he turned away his face that the\nhard man of the world before him might not see the tear gathering in\nhis eye.\n\n\"But, Mark, my dear fellow--\" said Sowerby, trying to have recourse\nto the power of his cajoling voice.\n\nRobarts, however, would not listen.\n\n\"Mr. Sowerby,\" said he, with an attempt at calmness which betrayed\nitself at every syllable, \"it seems to me that you have robbed\nme. That I have been a fool, and worse than a fool, I know well;\nbut--but--but I thought that your position in the world would\nguarantee me from such treatment as this.\"\n\nMr. Sowerby was by no means without feeling, and the words which he\nnow heard cut him very deeply--the more so because it was impossible\nthat he should answer them with an attempt at indignation. He had\nrobbed his friend, and, with all his wit, knew no words at the\npresent moment sufficiently witty to make it seem that he had not\ndone so.\n\n\"Robarts,\" said he, \"you may say what you like to me now; I shall not\nresent it.\"\n\n\"Who would care for your resentment?\" said the clergyman, turning on\nhim with ferocity. \"The resentment of a gentleman is terrible to a\ngentleman; and the resentment of one just man is terrible to another.\nYour resentment!\"--and then he walked twice the length of the room,\nleaving Sowerby dumb in his seat. \"I wonder whether you ever thought\nof my wife and children when you were plotting this ruin for me!\" And\nthen again he walked the room.\n\n\"I suppose you will be calm enough presently to speak of this with\nsome attempt to make a settlement?\"\n\n\"No; I will make no such attempt. These friends of yours, you tell\nme, have a claim on me for nine hundred pounds, of which they demand\nimmediate payment. You shall be asked in a court of law how much of\nthat money I have handled. You know that I have never touched--have\nnever wanted to touch--one shilling. I will make no attempt at any\nsettlement. My person is here, and there is my house. Let them do\ntheir worst.\"\n\n\"But, Mark--\"\n\n\"Call me by my name, sir, and drop that affectation of regard. What\nan ass I have been to be so cozened by a sharper!\"\n\nSowerby had by no means expected this. He had always known that\nRobarts possessed what he, Sowerby, would have called the spirit of\na gentleman. He had regarded him as a bold, open, generous fellow,\nable to take his own part when called on to do so, and by no means\ndisinclined to speak his own mind; but he had not expected from him\nsuch a torrent of indignation, or thought that he was capable of such\na depth of anger.\n\n\"If you use such language as that, Robarts, I can only leave you.\"\n\n\"You are welcome. Go. You tell me that you are the messenger of these\nmen who intend to work nine hundred pounds out of me. You have done\nyour part in the plot, and have now brought their message. It seems\nto me that you had better go back to them. As for me, I want my time\nto prepare my wife for the destiny before her.\"\n\n\"Robarts, you will be sorry some day for the cruelty of your words.\"\n\n\"I wonder whether you will ever be sorry for the cruelty of your\ndoings, or whether these things are really a joke to you.\"\n\n\"I am at this moment a ruined man,\" said Sowerby. \"Everything is\ngoing from me,--my place in the world, the estate of my family, my\nfather's house, my seat in Parliament, the power of living among my\ncountrymen, or, indeed, of living anywhere;--but all this does not\noppress me now so much as the misery which I have brought upon you.\"\nAnd then Sowerby also turned away his face, and wiped from his eyes\ntears which were not artificial.\n\nRobarts was still walking up and down the room, but it was not\npossible for him to continue his reproaches after this. This is\nalways the case. Let a man endure to heap contumely on his own head,\nand he will silence the contumely of others--for the moment. Sowerby,\nwithout meditating on the matter, had had some inkling of this, and\nimmediately saw that there was at last an opening for conversation.\n\n\"You are unjust to me,\" said he, \"in supposing that I have now no\nwish to save you. It is solely in the hope of doing so that I have\ncome here.\"\n\n\"And what is your hope? That I should accept another brace of bills,\nI suppose.\"\n\n\"Not a brace; but one renewed bill for--\"\n\n\"Look here, Mr. Sowerby. On no earthly consideration that can be put\nbefore me will I again sign my name to any bill in the guise of an\nacceptance. I have been very weak, and am ashamed of my weakness; but\nso much strength as that, I hope, is left to me. I have been very\nwicked, and am ashamed of my wickedness; but so much right principle\nas that, I hope, remains. I will put my name to no other bill; not\nfor you, not even for myself.\"\n\n\"But, Robarts, under your present circumstances that will be\nmadness.\"\n\n\"Then I will be mad.\"\n\n\"Have you seen Forrest? If you will speak to him I think you will\nfind that everything can be accommodated.\"\n\n\"I already owe Mr. Forrest a hundred and fifty pounds, which I\nobtained from him when you pressed me for the price of that horse,\nand I will not increase the debt. What a fool I was again there.\nPerhaps you do not remember that, when I agreed to buy the horse, the\nprice was to be my contribution to the liquidation of these bills.\"\n\n\"I do remember it; but I will tell you how that was.\"\n\n\"It does not signify. It has been all of a piece.\"\n\n\"But listen to me. I think you would feel for me if you knew all\nthat I have gone through. I pledge you my solemn word that I\nhad no intention of asking you for the money when you took the\nhorse;--indeed I had not. But you remember that affair of Lufton's,\nwhen he came to you at your hotel in London and was so angry about an\noutstanding bill.\"\n\n\"I know that he was very unreasonable as far as I was concerned.\"\n\n\"He was so; but that makes no difference. He was resolved, in his\nrage, to expose the whole affair; and I saw that, if he did so, it\nwould be most injurious to you, seeing that you had just accepted\nyour stall at Barchester.\" Here the poor prebendary winced terribly.\n\"I moved heaven and earth to get up that bill. Those vultures stuck\nto their prey when they found the value which I attached to it, and\nI was forced to raise above a hundred pounds at the moment to obtain\npossession of it, although every shilling absolutely due on it had\nlong since been paid. Never in my life did I wish to get money as I\ndid to raise that hundred and twenty pounds; and as I hope for mercy\nin my last moments, I did that for your sake. Lufton could not have\ninjured me in that matter.\"\n\n\"But you told him that you got it for twenty-five pounds.\"\n\n\"Yes, I told him so. I was obliged to tell him that, or I should have\napparently condemned myself by showing how anxious I was to get it.\nAnd you know I could not have explained all this before him and you.\nYou would have thrown up the stall in disgust.\"\n\nWould that he had! That was Mark's wish now,--his futile wish. In\nwhat a slough of despond had he come to wallow in consequence of his\nfolly on that night at Gatherum Castle! He had then done a silly\nthing, and was he now to rue it by almost total ruin? He was sickened\nalso with all these lies. His very soul was dismayed by the dirt\nthrough which he was forced to wade. He had become unconsciously\nconnected with the lowest dregs of mankind, and would have to see his\nname mingled with theirs in the daily newspapers. And for what had he\ndone this? Why had he thus filed his mind and made himself a disgrace\nto his cloth? In order that he might befriend such a one as Mr.\nSowerby!\n\n\"Well,\" continued Sowerby, \"I did get the money, but you would\nhardly believe the rigour of the pledge which was exacted from me\nfor repayment. I got it from Harold Smith, and never, in my worst\nstraits, will I again look to him for assistance. I borrowed it only\nfor a fortnight; and in order that I might repay it, I was obliged to\nask you for the price of the horse. Mark, it was on your behalf that\nI did all this,--indeed it was.\"\n\n\"And now I am to repay you for your kindness by the loss of all that\nI have in the world.\"\n\n\"If you will put the affair into the hands of Mr. Forrest, nothing\nneed be touched,--not a hair of a horse's back; no, not though you\nshould be obliged to pay the whole amount yourself, gradually out\nof your income. You must execute a series of bills, falling due\nquarterly, and then--\"\n\n\"I will execute no bill, I will put my name to no paper in the\nmatter; as to that my mind is fully made up. They may come and do\ntheir worst.\"\n\nMr. Sowerby persevered for a long time, but he was quite unable to\nmove the parson from this position. He would do nothing towards\nmaking what Mr. Sowerby called an arrangement, but persisted that he\nwould remain at home at Framley, and that any one who had a claim\nupon him might take legal steps.\n\n\"I shall do nothing myself,\" he said; \"but if proceedings against\nme be taken, I shall prove that I have never had a shilling of the\nmoney.\" And in this resolution he quitted the Dragon of Wantly.\n\nMr. Sowerby at one time said a word as to the expediency of borrowing\nthat sum of money from John Robarts; but as to this Mark would say\nnothing. Mr. Sowerby was not the friend with whom he now intended to\nhold consultation in such matters. \"I am not at present prepared,\" he\nsaid, \"to declare what I may do; I must first see what steps others\ntake.\" And then he took his hat and went off; and mounting his horse\nin the yard of the Dragon of Wantly--that horse which he had now so\nmany reasons to dislike--he slowly rode back home.\n\nMany thoughts passed through his mind during that ride, but only one\nresolution obtained for itself a fixture there. He must now tell his\nwife everything. He would not be so cruel as to let it remain untold\nuntil a bailiff were at the door, ready to walk him off to the county\ngaol, or until the bed on which they slept was to be sold from under\nthem. Yes, he would tell her everything,--immediately, before his\nresolution could again have faded away. He got off his horse in the\nyard, and seeing his wife's maid at the kitchen door, desired her to\nbeg her mistress to come to him in the book-room. He would not allow\none half-hour to pass towards the waning of his purpose. If it be\nordained that a man shall drown, had he not better drown and have\ndone with it?\n\nMrs. Robarts came to him in his room, reaching him in time to touch\nhis arm as he entered it.\n\n\"Mary says you want me. I have been gardening, and she caught me just\nas I came in.\"\n\n\"Yes, Fanny, I do want you. Sit down for a moment.\" And walking\nacross the room, he placed his whip in its proper place.\n\n\"Oh, Mark, is there anything the matter?\"\n\n\"Yes, dearest; yes. Sit down, Fanny; I can talk to you better if you\nwill sit.\"\n\nBut she, poor lady, did not wish to sit. He had hinted at some\nmisfortune, and therefore she felt a longing to stand by him and\ncling to him.\n\n\"Well, there; I will if I must; but, Mark, do not frighten me. Why is\nyour face so very wretched?\"\n\n\"Fanny, I have done very wrong,\" he said. \"I have been very foolish.\nI fear that I have brought upon you great sorrow and trouble.\" And\nthen he leaned his head upon his hand and turned his face away from\nher.\n\n\"Oh, Mark, dearest Mark, my own Mark! what is it?\" and then she was\nquickly up from her chair, and went down on her knees before him. \"Do\nnot turn from me. Tell me, Mark! tell me, that we may share it.\"\n\n\"Yes, Fanny, I must tell you now; but I hardly know what you will\nthink of me when you have heard it.\"\n\n\"I will think that you are my own husband, Mark; I will think\nthat--that chiefly, whatever it may be.\" And then she caressed his\nknees, and looked up in his face, and, getting hold of one of his\nhands, pressed it between her own. \"Even if you have been foolish,\nwho should forgive you if I cannot?\"\n\nAnd then he told it her all, beginning from that evening when Mr.\nSowerby had got him into his bedroom, and going on gradually, now\nabout the bills, and now about the horses, till his poor wife was\nutterly lost in the complexity of the accounts. She could by no\nmeans follow him in the details of his story; nor could she quite\nsympathize with him in his indignation against Mr. Sowerby, seeing\nthat she did not comprehend at all the nature of the renewing of a\nbill. The only part to her of importance in the matter was the amount\nof money which her husband would be called upon to pay;--that and\nher strong hope, which was already a conviction, that he would never\nagain incur such debts.\n\n\"And how much is it, dearest, altogether?\"\n\n\"These men claim nine hundred pounds of me.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear! that is a terrible sum.\"\n\n\"And then there is the hundred and fifty which I have borrowed from\nthe bank--the price of the horse, you know; and there are some other\ndebts,--not a great deal, I think; but people will now look for every\nshilling that is due to them. If I have to pay it all, it will be\ntwelve or thirteen hundred pounds.\"\n\n\"That will be as much as a year's income, Mark; even with the stall.\"\n\nThat was the only word of reproach she said,--if that could be called\na reproach.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said; \"and it is claimed by men who will have no pity in\nexacting it at any sacrifice, if they have the power. And to think\nthat I should have incurred all this debt without having received\nanything for it. Oh, Fanny, what will you think of me!\"\n\nBut she swore to him that she would think nothing of it;--that she\nwould never bear it in her mind against him,--that it could have no\neffect in lessening her trust in him. Was he not her husband? She was\nso glad she knew it, that she might comfort him. And she did comfort\nhim, making the weight seem lighter and lighter on his shoulders\nas he talked of it. And such weights do thus become lighter. A\nburden that will crush a single pair of shoulders will, when equally\ndivided--when shared by two, each of whom is willing to take the\nheavier part--become light as a feather. Is not that sharing of the\nmind's burdens one of the chief purposes for which a man wants a\nwife? For there is no folly so great as keeping one's sorrows hidden.\n\nAnd this wife cheerfully, gladly, thankfully took her share. To\nendure with her lord all her lord's troubles was easy to her; it was\nthe work to which she had pledged herself. But to have thought that\nher lord had troubles not communicated to her--that would have been\nto her the one thing not to be borne.\n\nAnd then they discussed their plans;--what mode of escape they might\nhave out of this terrible money difficulty. Like a true woman, Mrs.\nRobarts proposed at once to abandon all superfluities. They would\nsell all their horses; they would not sell their cows, but would sell\nthe butter that came from them; they would sell the pony-carriage,\nand get rid of the groom. That the footman must go was so much a\nmatter of course, that it was hardly mentioned. But then, as to\nthat house at Barchester, the dignified prebendal mansion in the\nclose--might they not be allowed to leave it unoccupied for one year\nlonger,--perhaps to let it? The world of course must know of their\nmisfortune; but if that misfortune was faced bravely, the world\nwould be less bitter in its condemnation. And then, above all things,\neverything must be told to Lady Lufton.\n\n\"You may, at any rate, believe this, Fanny,\" said he, \"that for no\nconsideration which can be offered to me will I ever put my name to\nanother bill.\"\n\nThe kiss with which she thanked him for this was as warm and generous\nas though he had brought to her that day news of the brightest; and\nwhen he sat, as he did that evening, discussing it all, not only with\nhis wife, but with Lucy, he wondered how it was that his troubles\nwere now so light.\n\nWhether or no a man should have his own private pleasures, I will\nnot now say; but it never can be worth his while to keep his sorrows\nprivate.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\n\nLADY LUFTON IS TAKEN BY SURPRISE.\n\n\nLord Lufton, as he returned to town, found some difficulty in\nresolving what step he would next take. Sometimes, for a minute or\ntwo, he was half inclined to think--or rather to say to himself--that\nLucy was perhaps not worth the trouble which she threw in his way.\nHe loved her very dearly, and would willingly make her his wife,\nhe thought or said at such moments; but-- Such moments, however,\nwere only moments. A man in love seldom loves less because his love\nbecomes difficult. And thus, when those moments were over, he would\ndetermine to tell his mother at once, and urge her to signify her\nconsent to Miss Robarts. That she would not be quite pleased he knew;\nbut if he were firm enough to show that he had a will of his own in\nthis matter, she would probably not gainsay him. He would not ask\nthis humbly, as a favour, but request her ladyship to go through the\nceremony as though it were one of those motherly duties which she\nas a good mother could not hesitate to perform on behalf of her son.\nSuch was the final resolve with which he reached his chambers in the\nAlbany.\n\nOn the next day he did not see his mother. It would be well, he\nthought, to have his interview with her immediately before he started\nfor Norway, so that there might be no repetition of it; and it was on\nthe day before he did start that he made his communication, having\ninvited himself to breakfast in Brook Street on the occasion.\n\n\"Mother,\" he said, quite abruptly, throwing himself into one of the\ndining-room arm-chairs, \"I have a thing to tell you.\"\n\nHis mother at once knew that the thing was important, and with her\nown peculiar motherly instinct imagined that the question to be\ndiscussed had reference to matrimony. Had her son desired to speak\nto her about money, his tone and look would have been different; as\nwould also have been the case--in a different way--had he entertained\nany thought of a pilgrimage to Pekin, or a prolonged fishing\nexcursion to the Hudson Bay territories.\n\n\"A thing, Ludovic! well; I am quite at liberty.\"\n\n\"I want to know what you think of Lucy Robarts?\"\n\nLady Lufton became pale and frightened, and the blood ran cold to her\nheart. She had feared more than rejoiced in conceiving that her son\nwas about to talk of love, but she had feared nothing so bad as this.\n\"What do I think of Lucy Robarts?\" she said, repeating her son's\nwords in a tone of evident dismay.\n\n\"Yes, mother; you have said once or twice lately that you thought I\nought to marry, and I am beginning to think so too. You selected one\nclergyman's daughter for me, but that lady is going to do much better\nwith herself--\"\n\n\"Indeed she is not,\" said Lady Lufton sharply.\n\n\"And therefore I rather think I shall select for myself another\nclergyman's sister. You don't dislike Miss Robarts, I hope?\"\n\n\"Oh, Ludovic!\"\n\nIt was all that Lady Lufton could say at the spur of the moment.\n\n\"Is there any harm in her? Have you any objection to her? Is there\nanything about her that makes her unfit to be my wife?\"\n\nFor a moment or two Lady Lufton sat silent, collecting her thoughts.\nShe thought that there was very great objection to Lucy Robarts,\nregarding her as the possible future Lady Lufton. She could hardly\nhave stated all her reasons, but they were very cogent. Lucy Robarts\nhad, in her eyes, neither beauty, nor style, nor manner, nor even the\neducation which was desirable. Lady Lufton was not herself a worldly\nwoman. She was almost as far removed from being so as a woman could\nbe in her position. But, nevertheless, there were certain worldly\nattributes which she regarded as essential to the character of any\nyoung lady who might be considered fit to take the place which she\nherself had so long filled. It was her desire in looking for a wife\nfor her son to combine these with certain moral excellences which\nshe regarded as equally essential. Lucy Robarts might have the moral\nexcellences, or she might not; but as to the other attributes Lady\nLufton regarded her as altogether deficient. She could never look\nlike a Lady Lufton, or carry herself in the county as a Lady Lufton\nshould do. She had not that quiet personal demeanour--that dignity of\nrepose--which Lady Lufton loved to look upon in a young married woman\nof rank. Lucy, she would have said, could be nobody in a room except\nby dint of her tongue, whereas Griselda Grantly would have held her\npeace for a whole evening, and yet would have impressed everybody\nby the majesty of her presence. Then again Lucy had no money--and,\nagain, Lucy was only the sister of her own parish clergyman. People\nare rarely prophets in their own country, and Lucy was no prophet\nat Framley; she was none, at least, in the eyes of Lady Lufton.\nOnce before, as may be remembered, she had had fears on this\nsubject--fears, not so much for her son, whom she could hardly bring\nherself to suspect of such a folly, but for Lucy, who might be\nfoolish enough to fancy that the lord was in love with her. Alas!\nalas! her son's question fell upon the poor woman at the present\nmoment with the weight of a terrible blow.\n\n\"Is there anything about her which makes her unfit to be my wife?\"\n\nThose were her son's last words.\n\n\"Dearest Ludovic, dearest Ludovic!\" and she got up and came over to\nhim, \"I do think so; I do, indeed.\"\n\n\"Think what?\" said he, in a tone that was almost angry.\n\n\"I do think that she is unfit to be your wife. She is not of that\nclass from which I would wish to see you choose.\"\n\n\"She is of the same class as Griselda Grantly.\"\n\n\"No, dearest. I think you are in error there. The Grantlys have moved\nin a different sphere of life. I think you must feel that they are--\"\n\n\"Upon my word, mother, I don't. One man is Rector of Plumstead, and\nthe other is Vicar of Framley. But it is no good arguing that. I want\nyou to take to Lucy Robarts. I have come to you on purpose to ask it\nof you as a favour.\"\n\n\"Do you mean as your wife, Ludovic?\"\n\n\"Yes; as my wife.\"\n\n\"Am I to understand that you are--are engaged to her?\"\n\n\"Well, I cannot say that I am--not actually engaged to her. But you\nmay take this for granted, that, as far as it lies in my power, I\nintend to become so. My mind is made up, and I certainly shall not\nalter it.\"\n\n\"And the young lady knows all this?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"Horrid, sly, detestable, underhand girl,\" Lady Lufton said to\nherself, not being by any means brave enough to speak out such\nlanguage before her son. What hope could there be if Lord Lufton had\nalready committed himself by a positive offer? \"And her brother, and\nMrs. Robarts; are they aware of it?\"\n\n\"Yes; both of them.\"\n\n\"And both approve of it?\"\n\n\"Well, I cannot say that. I have not seen Mrs. Robarts, and do not\nknow what may be her opinion. To speak my mind honestly about Mark,\nI do not think he does cordially approve. He is afraid of you, and\nwould be desirous of knowing what you think.\"\n\n\"I am glad, at any rate, to hear that,\" said Lady Lufton, gravely.\n\"Had he done anything to encourage this, it would have been very\nbase.\" And then there was another short period of silence.\n\nLord Lufton had determined not to explain to his mother the whole\nstate of the case. He would not tell her that everything depended\non her word--that Lucy was ready to marry him only on condition\nthat she, Lady Lufton, would desire her to do so. He would not\nlet her know that everything depended on her--according to Lucy's\npresent verdict. He had a strong disinclination to ask his mother's\npermission to get married; and he would have to ask it were he to\ntell her the whole truth. His object was to make her think well of\nLucy, and to induce her to be kind, and generous, and affectionate\ndown at Framley. Then things would all turn out comfortably when he\nagain visited that place, as he intended to do on his return from\nNorway. So much he thought it possible he might effect, relying on\nhis mother's probable calculation that it would be useless for her\nto oppose a measure which she had no power of stopping by authority.\nBut were he to tell her that she was to be the final judge, that\neverything was to depend on her will, then, so thought Lord Lufton,\nthat permission would in all probability be refused.\n\n\"Well, mother, what answer do you intend to give me?\" he said. \"My\nmind is positively made up. I should not have come to you had not\nthat been the case. You will now be going down home, and I would wish\nyou to treat Lucy as you yourself would wish to treat any girl to\nwhom you knew that I was engaged.\"\n\n\"But you say that you are not engaged.\"\n\n\"No, I am not; but I have made my offer to her, and I have not been\nrejected. She has confessed that she--loves me,--not to myself, but\nto her brother. Under these circumstances, may I count upon your\nobliging me?\"\n\nThere was something in his manner which almost frightened his mother,\nand made her think that there was more behind than was told to her.\nGenerally speaking, his manner was open, gentle, and unguarded; but\nnow he spoke as though he had prepared his words, and was resolved on\nbeing harsh as well as obstinate.\n\n\"I am so much taken by surprise, Ludovic, that I can hardly give you\nan answer. If you ask me whether I approve of such a marriage, I must\nsay that I do not; I think that you would be throwing yourself away\nin marrying Miss Robarts.\"\n\n\"That is because you do not know her.\"\n\n\"May it not be possible that I know her better than you do, dear\nLudovic? You have been flirting with her--\"\n\n\"I hate that word; it always sounds to me to be vulgar.\"\n\n\"I will say making love to her, if you like it better; and gentlemen\nunder these circumstances will sometimes become infatuated.\"\n\n\"You would not have a man marry a girl without making love to her.\nThe fact is, mother, that your tastes and mine are not exactly the\nsame; you like silent beauty, whereas I like talking beauty, and\nthen--\"\n\n\"Do you call Miss Robarts beautiful?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do; very beautiful; she has the beauty that I admire.\nGood-bye now, mother; I shall not see you again before I start. It\nwill be no use writing, as I shall be away so short a time, and I\ndon't quite know where we shall be. I shall come down to Framley\nimmediately I return, and shall learn from you how the land lies. I\nhave told you my wishes, and you will consider how far you think it\nright to fall in with them.\" He then kissed her, and without waiting\nfor her reply he took his leave.\n\nPoor Lady Lufton, when she was left to herself, felt that her\nhead was going round and round. Was this to be the end of all her\nambition,--of all her love for her son? and was this to be the result\nof all her kindness to the Robartses? She almost hated Mark Robarts\nas she reflected that she had been the means of bringing him and his\nsister to Framley. She thought over all his sins, his absences from\nthe parish, his visit to Gatherum Castle, his dealings with reference\nto that farm which was to have been sold, his hunting, and then his\nacceptance of that stall, given, as she had been told, through the\nOmnium interest. How could she love him at such a moment as this?\nAnd then she thought of his wife. Could it be possible that Fanny\nRobarts, her own friend Fanny, would be so untrue to her as to\nlend any assistance to such a marriage as this; as not to use all\nher power in preventing it? She had spoken to Fanny on this very\nsubject,--not fearing for her son, but with a general idea of the\nimpropriety of intimacies between such girls as Lucy and such men as\nLord Lufton, and then Fanny had agreed with her. Could it be possible\nthat even she must be regarded as an enemy?\n\nAnd then by degrees Lady Lufton began to reflect what steps she had\nbetter take. In the first place, should she give in at once, and\nconsent to the marriage? The only thing quite certain to her was\nthis, that life would be not worth having if she were forced into a\npermanent quarrel with her son. Such an event would probably kill\nher. When she read of quarrels in other noble families--and the\naccounts of such quarrels will sometimes, unfortunately, force\nthemselves upon the attention of unwilling readers--she would hug\nherself, with a spirit that was almost pharisaical, reflecting that\nher destiny was not like that of others. Such quarrels and hatreds\nbetween fathers and daughters, and mothers and sons, were in her eyes\ndisreputable to all the persons concerned. She had lived happily with\nher husband, comfortably with her neighbours, respectably with the\nworld, and, above all things, affectionately with her children.\nShe spoke everywhere of Lord Lufton as though he were nearly\nperfect,--and in so speaking, she had not belied her convictions.\nUnder these circumstances, would not any marriage be better than a\nquarrel?\n\nBut then, again, how much of the pride of her daily life would be\ndestroyed by such a match as that! And might it not be within her\npower to prevent it without any quarrel? That her son would be\nsick of such a chit as Lucy before he had been married to her six\nmonths--of that Lady Lufton entertained no doubt, and therefore her\nconscience would not be disquieted in disturbing the consummation of\nan arrangement so pernicious. It was evident that the matter was not\nconsidered as settled even by her son; and also evident that he\nregarded the matter as being in some way dependent on his mother's\nconsent. On the whole, might it not be better for her--better for\nthem all--that she should think wholly of her duty, and not of the\ndisagreeable results to which that duty might possibly lead? It\ncould not be her duty to accede to such an alliance; and therefore\nshe would do her best to prevent it. Such, at least, should be her\nattempt in the first instance.\n\nHaving so decided, she next resolved on her course of action.\nImmediately on her arrival at Framley, she would send for Lucy\nRobarts, and use all her eloquence--and perhaps also a little of that\nstern dignity for which she was so remarkable--in explaining to that\nyoung lady how very wicked it was on her part to think of forcing\nherself into such a family as that of the Luftons. She would explain\nto Lucy that no happiness could come of it, that people placed by\nmisfortune above their sphere are always miserable; and, in short,\nmake use of all those excellent moral lessons which are so customary\non such occasions. The morality might, perhaps, be thrown away;\nbut Lady Lufton depended much on her dignified sternness. And then,\nhaving so resolved, she prepared for her journey home.\n\nVery little had been said at Framley Parsonage about Lord Lufton's\noffer after the departure of that gentleman; very little, at least,\nin Lucy's presence. That the parson and his wife should talk about it\nbetween themselves was a matter of course; but very few words were\nspoken on the matter either by or to Lucy. She was left to her own\nthoughts, and possibly to her own hopes.\n\nAnd then other matters came up at Framley which turned the current of\ninterest into other tracks. In the first place there was the visit\nmade by Mr. Sowerby to the Dragon of Wantly, and the consequent\nrevelation made by Mark Robarts to his wife. And while that latter\nsubject was yet new, before Fanny and Lucy had as yet made up their\nminds as to all the little economies which might be practised in the\nhousehold without serious detriment to the master's comfort, news\nreached them that Mrs. Crawley of Hogglestock had been stricken with\nfever. Nothing of the kind could well be more dreadful than this.\nTo those who knew the family it seemed impossible that their most\nordinary wants could be supplied if that courageous head were even\nfor a day laid low; and then the poverty of poor Mr. Crawley was\nsuch that the sad necessities of a sick bed could hardly be supplied\nwithout assistance.\n\n\"I will go over at once,\" said Fanny.\n\n\"My dear!\" said her husband, \"it is typhus, and you must first think\nof the children. I will go.\"\n\n\"What on earth could you do, Mark?\" said his wife. \"Men on such\noccasions are almost worse than useless; and then they are so much\nmore liable to infection.\"\n\n\"I have no children, nor am I a man,\" said Lucy, smiling; \"for both\nof which exemptions I am thankful. I will go, and when I come back\nI will keep clear of the bairns.\"\n\nSo it was settled, and Lucy started in the pony-carriage, carrying\nwith her such things from the parsonage storehouse as were thought\nto be suitable to the wants of the sick lady at Hogglestock. When\nshe arrived there, she made her way into the house, finding the door\nopen, and not being able to obtain the assistance of the servant\ngirl in ushering her in. In the parlour she found Grace Crawley,\nthe eldest child, sitting demurely in her mother's chair nursing an\ninfant. She, Grace herself, was still a young child, but not the\nless, on this occasion of well-understood sorrow, did she go through\nher task not only with zeal but almost with solemnity. Her brother,\na boy of six years old, was with her, and he had the care of\nanother baby. There they sat in a cluster, quiet, grave, and silent,\nattending on themselves, because it had been willed by fate that no\none else should attend on them.\n\n\"How is your mamma, dear Grace?\" said Lucy, walking up to her, and\nholding out her hand.\n\n\"Poor mamma is very ill, indeed,\" said Grace.\n\n\"And papa is very unhappy,\" said Bobby, the boy.\n\n\"I can't get up because of baby,\" said Grace; \"but Bobby can go and\ncall papa out.\"\n\n\"I will knock at the door,\" said Lucy, and so saying she walked up to\nthe bedroom door, and tapped against it lightly. She repeated this\nfor the third time before she was summoned in by a low hoarse voice,\nand then on entering she saw Mr. Crawley standing by the bedside with\na book in his hand. He looked at her uncomfortably, in a manner which\nseemed to show that he was annoyed by this intrusion, and Lucy was\naware that she had disturbed him while at prayers by the bedside of\nhis wife. He came across the room, however, and shook hands with her,\nand answered her inquiries in his ordinary grave and solemn voice.\n\n\"Mrs. Crawley is very ill,\" he said, \"very ill. God has stricken us\nheavily, but His will be done. But you had better not go to her, Miss\nRobarts. It is typhus.\"\n\nThe caution, however, was too late; for Lucy was already by the\nbedside, and had taken the hand of the sick woman, which had been\nextended on the coverlid to greet her. \"Dear Miss Robarts,\" said a\nweak voice; \"this is very good of you; but it makes me unhappy to see\nyou here.\"\n\nLucy lost no time in taking sundry matters into her own hands, and\nascertaining what was most wanted in that wretched household. For\nit was wretched enough. Their only servant, a girl of sixteen, had\nbeen taken away by her mother as soon as it became known that Mrs.\nCrawley was ill with fever. The poor mother, to give her her due,\nhad promised to come down morning and evening herself, to do such\nwork as might be done in an hour or so; but she could not, she said,\nleave her child to catch the fever. And now, at the period of Lucy's\nvisit, no step had been taken to procure a nurse, Mr. Crawley having\nresolved to take upon himself the duties of that position. In his\nabsolute ignorance of all sanatory measures, he had thrown himself on\nhis knees to pray; and if prayers--true prayers--might succour his\npoor wife, of such succour she might be confident. Lucy, however,\nthought that other aid also was wanting to her.\n\n\"If you can do anything for us,\" said Mrs. Crawley, \"let it be for\nthe poor children.\"\n\n\"I will have them all moved from this till you are better,\" said\nLucy, boldly.\n\n\"Moved!\" said Mr. Crawley, who even now--even in his present\nstrait--felt a repugnance to the idea that any one should relieve him\nof any portion of his burden.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Lucy; \"I am sure it will be better that you should lose\nthem for a week or two, till Mrs. Crawley may be able to leave her\nroom.\"\n\n\"But where are they to go?\" said he, very gloomily.\n\nAs to this Lucy was not as yet able to say anything. Indeed when she\nleft Framley Parsonage there had been no time for discussion. She\nwould go back and talk it all over with Fanny, and find out in what\nway the children might be best put out of danger. Why should they\nnot all be harboured at the parsonage, as soon as assurance could\nbe felt that they were not tainted with the poison of the fever? An\nEnglish lady of the right sort will do all things but one for a sick\nneighbour; but for no neighbour will she wittingly admit contagious\nsickness within the precincts of her own nursery.\n\nLucy unloaded her jellies and her febrifuges, Mr. Crawley frowning\nat her bitterly the while. It had come to this with him, that food\nhad been brought into his house, as an act of charity, in his very\npresence, and in his heart of hearts he disliked Lucy Robarts in that\nshe had brought it. He could not cause the jars and the pots to be\nreplaced in the pony-carriage, as he would have done had the position\nof his wife been different. In her state it would have been barbarous\nto refuse them, and barbarous also to have created the _fracas_ of a\nrefusal; but each parcel that was introduced was an additional weight\nlaid on the sore withers of his pride, till the total burden became\nalmost intolerable. All this his wife saw and recognized even in her\nillness, and did make some slight ineffectual efforts to give him\nease; but Lucy in her new power was ruthless, and the chicken to make\nthe chicken-broth was taken out of the basket under his very nose.\n\nBut Lucy did not remain long. She had made up her mind what it\nbehoved her to do herself, and she was soon ready to return to\nFramley. \"I shall be back again, Mr. Crawley,\" she said, \"probably\nthis evening, and I shall stay with her till she is better.\" \"Nurses\ndon't want rooms,\" she went on to say, when Mr. Crawley muttered\nsomething as to there being no bed-chamber. \"I shall make up some\nsort of a litter near her; you'll see that I shall be very snug.\" And\nthen she got into the pony-chaise, and drove herself home.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV.\n\nTHE STORY OF KING COPHETUA.\n\n\nLucy as she drove herself home had much as to which it was necessary\nthat she should arouse her thoughts. That she would go back and nurse\nMrs. Crawley through her fever she was resolved. She was free agent\nenough to take so much on herself, and to feel sure that she could\ncarry it through. But how was she to redeem her promise about the\nchildren? Twenty plans ran through her mind, as to farm-houses in\nwhich they might be placed, or cottages which might be hired for\nthem; but all these entailed the want of money; and at the present\nmoment, were not all the inhabitants of the parsonage pledged to a\ndire economy? This use of the pony-carriage would have been illicit\nunder any circumstances less pressing than the present, for it had\nbeen decided that the carriage, and even poor Puck himself, should\nbe sold. She had, however, given her promise about the children, and\nthough her own stock of money was very low, that promise should be\nredeemed.\n\nWhen she reached the parsonage she was of course full of her schemes,\nbut she found that another subject of interest had come up in her\nabsence, which prevented her from obtaining the undivided attention\nof her sister-in-law to her present plans. Lady Lufton had returned\nthat day, and immediately on her return had sent up a note addressed\nto Miss Lucy Robarts, which note was in Fanny's hands when Lucy\nstepped out of the pony-carriage. The servant who brought it had\nasked for an answer, and a verbal answer had been sent, saying that\nMiss Robarts was away from home, and would herself send a reply when\nshe returned. It cannot be denied that the colour came to Lucy's\nface, and that her hand trembled when she took the note from Fanny in\nthe drawing-room. Everything in the world to her might depend on what\nthat note contained; and yet she did not open it at once, but stood\nwith it in her hand, and when Fanny pressed her on the subject, still\nendeavoured to bring back the conversation to the subject of Mrs.\nCrawley.\n\nBut yet her mind was intent on the letter, and she had already\naugured ill from the handwriting and even from the words of the\naddress. Had Lady Lufton intended to be propitious, she would have\ndirected her letter to Miss Robarts, without the Christian name; so\nat least argued Lucy,--quite unconsciously, as one does argue in such\nmatters. One forms half the conclusions of one's life without any\ndistinct knowledge that the premises have even passed through one's\nmind.\n\nThey were now alone together, as Mark was out.\n\n\"Won't you open her letter?\" said Mrs. Robarts.\n\n\"Yes, immediately; but, Fanny, I must speak to you about Mrs. Crawley\nfirst. I must go back there this evening, and stay there; I have\npromised to do so, and shall certainly keep my promise. I have\npromised also that the children shall be taken away, and we must\narrange about that. It is dreadful, the state she is in. There is no\none to see to her but Mr. Crawley, and the children are altogether\nleft to themselves.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that you are going back to stay?\"\n\n\"Yes, certainly; I have made a distinct promise that I would do\nso. And about the children; could not you manage for the children,\nFanny,--not perhaps in the house; at least not at first perhaps?\"\nAnd yet during all the time that she was thus speaking and pleading\nfor the Crawleys, she was endeavouring to imagine what might be the\ncontents of that letter which she held between her fingers.\n\n\"And is she so very ill?\" asked Mrs. Robarts.\n\n\"I cannot say how ill she may be, except this, that she certainly has\ntyphus fever. They have had some doctor or doctor's assistant from\nSilverbridge; but it seems to me that they are greatly in want of\nbetter advice.\"\n\n\"But, Lucy, will you not read your letter? It is astonishing to me\nthat you should be so indifferent about it.\"\n\nLucy was anything but indifferent, and now did proceed to tear the\nenvelope. The note was very short, and ran in these words,--\n\n\n   MY DEAR MISS ROBARTS,--I am particularly anxious to see\n   you, and shall feel much obliged to you if you can step\n   over to me here, at Framley Court. I must apologize for\n   taking this liberty with you, but you will probably feel\n   that an interview here would suit us both better than one\n   at the parsonage. Truly yours,\n\n   M. LUFTON.\n\n\n\"There; I am in for it now,\" said Lucy, handing the note over to Mrs.\nRobarts. \"I shall have to be talked to as never poor girl was talked\nto before; and when one thinks of what I have done, it is hard.\"\n\n\"Yes; and of what you have not done.\"\n\n\"Exactly; and of what I have not done. But I suppose I must go,\" and\nshe proceeded to re-tie the strings of her bonnet, which she had\nloosened.\n\n\"Do you mean that you are going over at once?\"\n\n\"Yes; immediately. Why not? it will be better to have it over, and\nthen I can go to the Crawleys. But, Fanny, the pity of it is that I\nknow it all as well as though it had been already spoken; and what\ngood can there be in my having to endure it? Can't you fancy the\ntone in which she will explain to me the conventional inconveniences\nwhich arose when King Cophetua would marry the beggar's daughter? how\nshe will explain what Griselda went through;--not the archdeacon's\ndaughter, but the other Griselda?\"\n\n\"But it all came right with her.\"\n\n\"Yes; but then I am not Griselda, and she will explain how it would\ncertainly all go wrong with me. But what's the good when I know it\nall beforehand? Have I not desired King Cophetua to take himself and\nsceptre elsewhere?\"\n\nAnd then she started, having first said another word or two about\nthe Crawley children, and obtained a promise of Puck and the\npony-carriage for the afternoon. It was also almost agreed that\nPuck on his return to Framley should bring back the four children\nwith him; but on this subject it was necessary that Mark should be\nconsulted. The present scheme was to prepare for them a room outside\nthe house, once the dairy, at present occupied by the groom and his\nwife; and to bring them into the house as soon as it was manifest\nthat there was no danger from infection. But all this was to be\nmatter for deliberation.\n\nFanny wanted her to send over a note, in reply to Lady Lufton's, as\nharbinger of her coming; but Lucy marched off, hardly answering this\nproposition.\n\n\"What's the use of such a deal of ceremony?\" she said. \"I know she's\nat home; and if she is not, I shall only lose ten minutes in going.\"\nAnd so she went, and on reaching the door of Framley Court house\nfound that her ladyship was at home. Her heart almost came to her\nmouth as she was told so, and then, in two minutes' time, she found\nherself in the little room upstairs. In that little room we found\nourselves once before,--you, and I, O my reader;--but Lucy had never\nbefore visited that hallowed precinct. There was something in its\nair calculated to inspire awe in those who first saw Lady Lufton\nsitting bolt upright in the cane-bottomed arm-chair, which she always\noccupied when at work at her books and papers; and this she knew when\nshe determined to receive Lucy in that apartment. But there was there\nanother arm-chair, an easy, cozy chair, which stood by the fireside;\nand for those who had caught Lady Lufton napping in that chair of an\nafternoon, some of this awe had perhaps been dissipated.\n\n\"Miss Robarts,\" she said, not rising from her chair, but holding out\nher hand to her visitor; \"I am much obliged to you for having come\nover to me here. You, no doubt, are aware of the subject on which I\nwish to speak to you, and will agree with me that it is better that\nwe should meet here than over at the parsonage.\"\n\nIn answer to which Lucy merely bowed her head, and took her seat on\nthe chair which had been prepared for her.\n\n\"My son,\" continued her ladyship, \"has spoken to me on the subject\nof--I think I understand, Miss Robarts, that there has been no\nengagement between you and him?\"\n\n\"None whatever,\" said Lucy. \"He made me an offer and I refused\nhim.\" This she said very sharply;--more so undoubtedly than the\ncircumstances required; and with a brusqueness that was injudicious\nas well as uncourteous. But at the moment, she was thinking of her\nown position with reference to Lady Lufton--not to Lord Lufton; and\nof her feelings with reference to the lady--not to the gentleman.\n\n\"Oh,\" said Lady Lufton, a little startled by the manner of the\ncommunication. \"Then I am to understand that there is nothing now\ngoing on between you and my son;--that the whole affair is over?\"\n\n\"That depends entirely upon you.\"\n\n\"On me! does it?\"\n\n\"I do not know what your son may have told you, Lady Lufton. For\nmyself, I do not care to have any secrets from you in this matter;\nand as he has spoken to you about it, I suppose that such is his\nwish also. Am I right in presuming that he has spoken to you on the\nsubject?\"\n\n\"Yes, he has; and it is for that reason that I have taken the liberty\nof sending for you.\"\n\n\"And may I ask what he has told you? I mean, of course, as regards\nmyself,\" said Lucy.\n\nLady Lufton, before she answered this question, began to reflect\nthat the young lady was taking too much of the initiative in this\nconversation, and was, in fact, playing the game in her own fashion,\nwhich was not at all in accordance with those motives which had\ninduced Lady Lufton to send for her.\n\n\"He has told me that he made you an offer of marriage,\" replied Lady\nLufton; \"a matter which, of course, is very serious to me, as his\nmother; and I have thought, therefore, that I had better see you,\nand appeal to your own good sense and judgment and high feeling. Of\ncourse you are aware--\"\n\nNow was coming the lecture to be illustrated by King Cophetua and\nGriselda, as Lucy had suggested to Mrs. Robarts; but she succeeded in\nstopping it for awhile.\n\n\"And did Lord Lufton tell you what was my answer?\"\n\n\"Not in words. But you yourself now say that you refused him; and I\nmust express my admiration for your good--\"\n\n\"Wait half a moment, Lady Lufton. Your son did make me an offer. He\nmade it to me in person, up at the parsonage, and I then refused\nhim;--foolishly, as I now believe, for I dearly love him. But I did\nso from a mixture of feelings which I need not, perhaps, explain;\nthat most prominent, no doubt, was a fear of your displeasure. And\nthen he came again, not to me but to my brother, and urged his suit\nto him. Nothing can have been kinder to me, more noble, more loving,\nmore generous, than his conduct. At first I thought, when he was\nspeaking to myself, that he was led on thoughtlessly to say all that\nhe did say. I did not trust his love, though I saw that he did trust\nit himself. But I could not but trust it when he came again--to my\nbrother, and made his proposal to him. I don't know whether you will\nunderstand me, Lady Lufton; but a girl placed as I am feels ten times\nmore assurance in such a tender of affection as that, than in one\nmade to herself, at the spur of the moment, perhaps. And then you\nmust remember that I--I myself--I loved him from the first. I was\nfoolish enough to think that I could know him and not love him.\"\n\n\"I saw all that going on,\" said Lady Lufton, with a certain\nassumption of wisdom about her; \"and took steps which I hoped would\nhave put a stop to it in time.\"\n\n\"Everybody saw it. It was a matter of course,\" said Lucy, destroying\nher ladyship's wisdom at a blow. \"Well; I did learn to love him, not\nmeaning to do so; and I do love him with all my heart. It is no use\nmy striving to think that I do not; and I could stand with him at the\naltar to-morrow and give him my hand, feeling that I was doing my\nduty by him, as a woman should do. And now he has told you of his\nlove, and I believe in that as I do in my own--\" And then for a\nmoment she paused.\n\n\"But, my dear Miss Robarts--\" began Lady Lufton.\n\nLucy, however, had now worked herself up into a condition of power,\nand would not allow her ladyship to interrupt her in her speech.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, Lady Lufton; I shall have done directly, and then\nI will hear you. And so my brother came to me, not urging this suit,\nexpressing no wish for such a marriage, but allowing me to judge\nfor myself, and proposing that I should see your son again on the\nfollowing morning. Had I done so, I could not but have accepted him.\nThink of it, Lady Lufton. How could I have done other than accept\nhim, seeing that in my heart I had accepted his love already?\"\n\n\"Well?\" said Lady Lufton, not wishing now to put in any speech of her\nown.\n\n\"I did not see him--I refused to do so--because I was a coward. I\ncould not endure to come into this house as your son's wife, and be\ncoldly looked on by your son's mother. Much as I loved him, much as I\ndo love him, dearly as I prize the generous offer which he came down\nhere to repeat to me, I could not live with him to be made the object\nof your scorn. I sent him word, therefore, that I would have him when\nyou would ask me, and not before.\"\n\nAnd then, having thus pleaded her cause--and pleaded as she believed\nthe cause of her lover also--she ceased from speaking, and prepared\nherself to listen to the story of King Cophetua.\n\nBut Lady Lufton felt considerable difficulty in commencing her\nspeech. In the first place she was by no means a hard-hearted or\na selfish woman; and were it not that her own son was concerned,\nand all the glory which was reflected upon her from her son, her\nsympathies would have been given to Lucy Robarts. As it was, she did\nsympathize with her, and admire her, and to a certain extent like\nher. She began also to understand what it was that had brought\nabout her son's love, and to feel that but for certain unfortunate\nconcomitant circumstances the girl before her might have made\na fitting Lady Lufton. Lucy had grown bigger in her eyes while\nsitting there and talking, and had lost much of that missish want\nof importance--that lack of social weight which Lady Lufton in her\nown opinion had always imputed to her. A girl that could thus speak\nup and explain her own position now, would be able to speak up and\nexplain her own, and perhaps some other positions at any future time.\n\nBut not for all or any of these reasons did Lady Lufton think of\ngiving way. The power of making or marring this marriage was placed\nin her hands, as was very fitting, and that power it behoved her\nto use, as best she might use it, to her son's advantage. Much as\nshe might admire Lucy, she could not sacrifice her son to that\nadmiration. The unfortunate concomitant circumstances still remained,\nand were of sufficient force, as she thought, to make such a marriage\ninexpedient. Lucy was the sister of a gentleman, who by his peculiar\nposition as parish clergyman of Framley was unfitted to be the\nbrother-in-law of the owner of Framley. Nobody liked clergymen better\nthan Lady Lufton, or was more willing to live with them on terms\nof affectionate intimacy, but she could not get over the feeling\nthat the clergyman of her own parish,--or of her son's,--was a part\nof her own establishment, of her own appanage,--or of his,--and\nthat it could not be well that Lord Lufton should marry among his\nown--dependants. Lady Lufton would not have used the word, but she\ndid think it. And then, too, Lucy's education had been so deficient.\nShe had had no one about her in early life accustomed to the ways\nof,--of what shall I say, without making Lady Lufton appear more\nworldly than she was? Lucy's wants in this respect, not to be defined\nin words, had been exemplified by the very way in which she had just\nnow stated her case. She had shown talent, good temper, and sound\njudgment; but there had been no quiet, no repose about her. The\nspecies of power in young ladies which Lady Lufton most admired was\nthe _vis inerti\u00c3\u00a6_ belonging to beautiful and dignified reticence; of\nthis poor Lucy had none. Then, too, she had no fortune, which, though\na minor evil, was an evil; and she had no birth, in the high-life\nsense of the word, which was a greater evil. And then, though her\neyes had sparkled when she confessed her love, Lady Lufton was not\nprepared to admit that she was possessed of positive beauty. Such\nwere the unfortunate concomitant circumstances which still induced\nLady Lufton to resolve that the match must be marred.\n\nBut the performance of her part in this play was much more difficult\nthan she had imagined, and she found herself obliged to sit silent\nfor a minute or two, during which, however, Miss Robarts made no\nattempt at further speech.\n\n\"I am greatly struck,\" Lady Lufton said at last, \"by the excellent\nsense you have displayed in the whole of this affair; and you must\nallow me to say, Miss Robarts, that I now regard you with very\ndifferent feelings from those which I entertained when I left\nLondon.\" Upon this Lucy bowed her head, slightly but very stiffly;\nacknowledging rather the former censure implied than the present\neulogium expressed.\n\n\"But my feelings,\" continued Lady Lufton, \"my strongest feelings in\nthis matter, must be those of a mother. What might be my conduct if\nsuch a marriage did take place, I need not now consider. But I must\nconfess that I should think such a marriage very--very ill-judged.\nA better hearted young man than Lord Lufton does not exist, nor one\nwith better principles, or a deeper regard for his word; but he is\nexactly the man to be mistaken in any hurried outlook as to his\nfuture life. Were you and he to become man and wife, such a marriage\nwould tend to the happiness neither of him nor of you.\"\n\nIt was clear that the whole lecture was now coming; and as Lucy\nhad openly declared her own weakness, and thrown all the power of\ndecision into the hands of Lady Lufton, she did not see why she\nshould endure this.\n\n\"We need not argue about that, Lady Lufton,\" she said. \"I have told\nyou the only circumstances under which I would marry your son; and\nyou, at any rate, are safe.\"\n\n\"No; I was not wishing to argue,\" answered Lady Lufton, almost\nhumbly; \"but I was desirous of excusing myself to you, so that you\nshould not think me cruel in withholding my consent. I wished to make\nyou believe that I was doing the best for my son.\"\n\n\"I am sure that you think you are, and therefore no excuse is\nnecessary.\"\n\n\"No; exactly; of course it is a matter of opinion, and I do think so.\nI cannot believe that this marriage would make either of you happy,\nand therefore I should be very wrong to express my consent.\"\n\n\"Then, Lady Lufton,\" said Lucy, rising from her chair, \"I suppose we\nhave both now said what is necessary, and I will therefore wish you\ngood-bye.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, Miss Robarts. I wish I could make you understand how very\nhighly I regard your conduct in this matter. It has been above all\npraise, and so I shall not hesitate to say when speaking of it to\nyour relatives.\" This was disagreeable enough to Lucy, who cared\nbut little for any praise which Lady Lufton might express to her\nrelatives in this matter. \"And pray,\" continued Lady Lufton, \"give\nmy best love to Mrs. Robarts, and tell her that I shall hope to see\nher over here very soon, and Mr. Robarts also. I would name a day for\nyou all to dine, but perhaps it will be better that I should have a\nlittle talk with Fanny first.\"\n\nLucy muttered something, which was intended to signify that any\nsuch dinner-party had better not be made up with the intention of\nincluding her, and then took her leave. She had decidedly had the\nbest of the interview, and there was a consciousness of this in her\nheart as she allowed Lady Lufton to shake hands with her. She had\nstopped her antagonist short on each occasion on which an attempt had\nbeen made to produce the homily which had been prepared, and during\nthe interview had spoken probably three words for every one which\nher ladyship had been able to utter. But, nevertheless, there was\na bitter feeling of disappointment about her heart as she walked\nback home; and a feeling, also, that she herself had caused her own\nunhappiness. Why should she have been so romantic and chivalrous and\nself-sacrificing, seeing that her romance and chivalry had all been\nto his detriment as well as to hers,--seeing that she sacrificed\nhim as well as herself? Why should she have been so anxious to play\ninto Lady Lufton's hands? It was not because she thought it right,\nas a general social rule, that a lady should refuse a gentleman's\nhand, unless the gentleman's mother were a consenting party to the\nmarriage. She would have held any such doctrine as absurd. The lady,\nshe would have said, would have had to look to her own family and no\nfurther. It was not virtue but cowardice which had influenced her,\nand she had none of that solace which may come to us in misfortune\nfrom a consciousness that our own conduct has been blameless. Lady\nLufton had inspired her with awe, and any such feeling on her part\nwas mean, ignoble, and unbecoming the spirit with which she wished to\nthink that she was endowed. That was the accusation which she brought\nagainst herself, and it forbade her to feel any triumph as to the\nresult of her interview.\n\nWhen she reached the parsonage, Mark was there, and they were of\ncourse expecting her. \"Well,\" said she, in her short, hurried manner,\n\"is Puck ready again? I have no time to lose, and I must go and pack\nup a few things. Have you settled about the children, Fanny?\"\n\n\"Yes; I will tell you directly; but you have seen Lady Lufton?\"\n\n\"Seen her! Oh, yes, of course I have seen her. Did she not send for\nme? and in that case it was not on the cards that I should disobey\nher.\"\n\n\"And what did she say?\"\n\n\"How green you are, Mark; and not only green, but impolite also, to\nmake me repeat the story of my own disgrace. Of course she told me\nthat she did not intend that I should marry my lord, her son; and of\ncourse I said that under those circumstances I should not think of\ndoing such a thing.\"\n\n\"Lucy, I cannot understand you,\" said Fanny, very gravely. \"I am\nsometimes inclined to doubt whether you have any deep feeling in the\nmatter or not. If you have, how can you bring yourself to joke about\nit?\"\n\n\"Well, it is singular; and sometimes I doubt myself whether I have.\nI ought to be pale, ought I not? and very thin, and to go mad by\ndegrees? I have not the least intention of doing anything of the\nkind, and, therefore, the matter is not worth any further notice.\"\n\n\"But was she civil to you, Lucy?\" asked Mark; \"civil in her manner,\nyou know?\"\n\n\"Oh, uncommonly so. You will hardly believe it, but she actually\nasked me to dine. She always does, you know, when she wants to\nshow her good-humour. If you'd broken your leg, and she wished to\ncommiserate you, she'd ask you to dinner.\"\n\n\"I suppose she meant to be kind,\" said Fanny, who was not disposed to\ngive up her old friend, though she was quite ready to fight Lucy's\nbattle, if there were any occasion for a battle to be fought.\n\n\"Lucy is so perverse,\" said Mark, \"that it is impossible to learn\nfrom her what really has taken place.\"\n\n\"Upon my word, then, you know it all as well as I can tell you. She\nasked me if Lord Lufton had made me an offer. I said, yes. She asked\nnext, if I meant to accept it. Not without her approval, I said. And\nthen she asked us all to dinner. That is exactly what took place, and\nI cannot see that I have been perverse at all.\" After that she threw\nherself into a chair, and Mark and Fanny stood looking at each other.\n\n\"Mark,\" she said, after a while, \"don't be unkind to me. I make as\nlittle of it as I can, for all our sakes. It is better so, Fanny,\nthan that I should go about moaning, like a sick cow;\" and then they\nlooked at her, and saw that the tears were already brimming over from\nher eyes.\n\n\"Dearest, dearest Lucy,\" said Fanny, immediately going down on her\nknees before her, \"I won't be unkind to you again.\" And then they had\na great cry together.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\n\nKIDNAPPING AT HOGGLESTOCK.\n\n\nThe great cry, however, did not take long, and Lucy was soon in the\npony-carriage again. On this occasion her brother volunteered to\ndrive her, and it was now understood that he was to bring back with\nhim all the Crawley children. The whole thing had been arranged;\nthe groom and his wife were to be taken into the house, and the\nbig bedroom across the yard, usually occupied by them, was to be\nconverted into a quarantine hospital until such time as it might be\nsafe to pull down the yellow flag. They were about half way on their\nroad to Hogglestock when they were overtaken by a man on horseback,\nwhom, when he came up beside them, Mr. Robarts recognized as Dr.\nArabin, Dean of Barchester, and head of the chapter to which he\nhimself belonged. It immediately appeared that the dean also was\ngoing to Hogglestock, having heard of the misfortune that had\nbefallen his friends there; he had, he said, started as soon as the\nnews reached him, in order that he might ascertain how best he might\nrender assistance. To effect this he had undertaken a ride of nearly\nforty miles, and explained that he did not expect to reach home again\nmuch before midnight.\n\n\"You pass by Framley?\" said Robarts.\n\n\"Yes, I do,\" said the dean.\n\n\"Then of course you will dine with us as you go home; you and your\nhorse also, which will be quite as important.\" This having been duly\nsettled, and the proper ceremony of introduction having taken place\nbetween the dean and Lucy, they proceeded to discuss the character of\nMr. Crawley.\n\n\"I have known him all my life,\" said the dean, \"having been at school\nand college with him, and for years since that I was on terms of the\nclosest intimacy with him; but in spite of that, I do not know how to\nhelp him in his need. A prouder-hearted man I never met, or one less\nwilling to share his sorrows with his friends.\"\n\n\"I have often heard him speak of you,\" said Mark.\n\n\"One of the bitterest feelings I have is that a man so dear to me\nshould live so near to me, and that I should see so little of him.\nBut what can I do? He will not come to my house; and when I go to\nhis he is angry with me because I wear a shovel hat and ride on\nhorseback.\"\n\n\"I should leave my hat and my horse at the borders of the last\nparish,\" said Lucy, timidly.\n\n\"Well; yes, certainly; one ought not to give offence even in such\nmatters as that; but my coat and waistcoat would then be equally\nobjectionable. I have changed,--in outward matters I mean,--and he\nhas not. That irritates him, and unless I could be what I was in the\nold days, he will not look at me with the same eyes;\" and then he\nrode on, in order, as he said, that the first pang of the interview\nmight be over before Robarts and his sister came upon the scene.\n\nMr. Crawley was standing before his door, leaning over the little\nwooden railing, when the dean trotted up on his horse. He had come\nout after hours of close watching to get a few mouthfuls of the\nsweet summer air, and as he stood there he held the youngest of his\nchildren in his arms. The poor little baby sat there, quiet indeed,\nbut hardly happy. This father, though he loved his offspring with\nan affection as intense as that which human nature can supply, was\nnot gifted with the knack of making children fond of him; for it\nis hardly more than a knack, that aptitude which some men have of\ngaining the good graces of the young. Such men are not always the\nbest fathers or the safest guardians; but they carry about with them\na certain duc ad me which children recognize, and which in three\nminutes upsets all the barriers between five and five-and-forty.\nBut Mr. Crawley was a stern man, thinking ever of the souls and\nminds of his bairns--as a father should do; and thinking also that\nevery season was fitted for operating on these souls and minds--as,\nperhaps, he should not have done either as a father or as a teacher.\nAnd consequently his children avoided him when the choice was given\nthem, thereby adding fresh wounds to his torn heart, but by no means\nquenching any of the great love with which he regarded them.\n\nHe was standing there thus with a placid little baby in his arms--a\nbaby placid enough, but one that would not kiss him eagerly, and\nstroke his face with her soft little hands, as he would have had her\ndo--when he saw the dean coming towards him. He was sharp-sighted\nas a lynx out in the open air, though now obliged to pore over his\nwell-fingered books with spectacles on his nose; and thus he knew his\nfriend from a long distance, and had time to meditate the mode of his\ngreeting. He too doubtless had come, if not with jelly and chicken,\nthen with money and advice;--with money and advice such as a thriving\ndean might offer to a poor brother clergyman; and Mr. Crawley, though\nno husband could possibly be more anxious for a wife's safety than\nhe was, immediately put his back up and began to bethink himself how\nthese tenders might be rejected.\n\n\"How is she?\" were the first words which the dean spoke as he pulled\nup his horse close to the little gate, and put out his hand to take\nthat of his friend.\n\n\"How are you, Arabin?\" said he. \"It is very kind of you to come so\nfar, seeing how much there is to keep you at Barchester. I cannot\nsay that she is any better, but I do not know that she is worse.\nSometimes I fancy that she is delirious, though I hardly know. At any\nrate her mind wanders, and then after that she sleeps.\"\n\n\"But is the fever less?\"\n\n\"Sometimes less and sometimes more, I imagine.\"\n\n\"And the children?\"\n\n\"Poor things; they are well as yet.\"\n\n\"They must be taken from this, Crawley, as a matter of course.\"\n\nMr. Crawley fancied that there was a tone of authority in the dean's\nadvice, and immediately put himself into opposition.\n\n\"I do not know how that may be; I have not yet made up my mind.\"\n\n\"But, my dear Crawley--\"\n\n\"Providence does not admit of such removals in all cases,\" said he.\n\"Among the poorer classes the children must endure such perils.\"\n\n\"In many cases it is so,\" said the dean, by no means inclined to make\nan argument of it at the present moment; \"but in this case they need\nnot. You must allow me to make arrangements for sending for them, as\nof course your time is occupied here.\"\n\nMiss Robarts, though she had mentioned her intention of staying with\nMrs. Crawley, had said nothing of the Framley plan with reference to\nthe children.\n\n\"What you mean is that you intend to take the burden off my\nshoulders--in fact, to pay for them. I cannot allow that, Arabin.\nThey must take the lot of their father and their mother, as it is\nproper that they should do.\"\n\nAgain the dean had no inclination for arguing, and thought it might\nbe well to let the question of the children drop for a little while.\n\n\"And is there no nurse with her?\" said he.\n\n\"No, no; I am seeing to her myself at the present moment. A woman\nwill be here just now.\"\n\n\"What woman?\"\n\n\"Well; her name is Mrs. Stubbs; she lives in the parish. She will put\nthe younger children to bed, and--and--but it's no use troubling you\nwith all that. There was a young lady talked of coming, but no doubt\nshe has found it too inconvenient. It will be better as it is.\"\n\n\"You mean Miss Robarts; she will be here directly; I passed her as\nI came here;\" and as Dr. Arabin was yet speaking, the noise of the\ncarriage wheels was heard upon the road.\n\n\"I will go in now,\" said Mr. Crawley, \"and see if she still sleeps;\"\nand then he entered the house, leaving the dean at the door still\nseated upon his horse. \"He will be afraid of the infection, and I\nwill not ask him to come in,\" said Mr. Crawley to himself.\n\n\"I shall seem to be prying into his poverty, if I enter unasked,\"\nsaid the dean to himself. And so he remained there till Puck, now\nacquainted with the locality, stopped at the door.\n\n\"Have you not been in?\" said Robarts.\n\n\"No; Crawley has been at the door talking to me; he will be here\ndirectly, I suppose;\" and then Mark Robarts also prepared himself to\nwait till the master of the house should reappear.\n\nBut Lucy had no such punctilious misgivings; she did not much care\nnow whether she offended Mr. Crawley or no. Her idea was to place\nherself by the sick woman's bedside, and to send the four children\naway;--with their father's consent if it might be; but certainly\nwithout it if that consent were withheld. So she got down from the\ncarriage, and taking certain packages in her hand made her way direct\ninto the house.\n\n\"There's a big bundle under the seat, Mark,\" she said; \"I'll come and\nfetch it directly, if you'll drag it out.\"\n\nFor some five minutes the two dignitaries of the Church remained at\nthe door, one on his cob and the other in his low carriage, saying a\nfew words to each other and waiting till some one should again appear\nfrom the house. \"It is all arranged, indeed it is,\" were the first\nwords which reached their ears, and these came from Lucy. \"There will\nbe no trouble at all, and no expense, and they shall all come back as\nsoon as Mrs. Crawley is able to get out of bed.\"\n\n\"But, Miss Robarts, I can assure--\" That was Mr. Crawley's voice,\nheard from him as he followed Miss Robarts to the door; but one of\nthe elder children had then called him into the sick room, and Lucy\nwas left to do her worst.\n\n\"Are you going to take the children back with you?\" said the dean.\n\n\"Yes; Mrs. Robarts has prepared for them.\"\n\n\"You can take greater liberties with my friend here than I can.\"\n\n\"It is all my sister's doing,\" said Robarts. \"Women are always bolder\nin such matters than men.\" And then Lucy reappeared, bringing Bobby\nwith her, and one of the younger children.\n\n\"Do not mind what he says,\" said she, \"but drive away when you have\ngot them all. Tell Fanny I have put into the basket what things I\ncould find, but they are very few. She must borrow things for Grace\nfrom Mrs. Granger's little girl\"--(Mrs. Granger was the wife of a\nFramley farmer);--\"and, Mark, turn Puck's head round, so that you may\nbe off in a moment. I'll have Grace and the other one here directly.\"\nAnd then, leaving her brother to pack Bobby and his little sister on\nthe back part of the vehicle, she returned to her business in the\nhouse. She had just looked in at Mrs. Crawley's bed, and finding her\nawake, had smiled on her, and deposited her bundle in token of her\nintended stay, and then, without speaking a word, had gone on her\nerrand about the children. She had called to Grace to show her where\nshe might find such things as were to be taken to Framley, and having\nexplained to the bairns, as well as she might, the destiny which\nimmediately awaited them, prepared them for their departure without\nsaying a word to Mr. Crawley on the subject. Bobby and the elder\nof the two infants were stowed away safely in the back part of the\ncarriage, where they allowed themselves to be placed without saying\na word. They opened their eyes and stared at the dean, who sat by on\nhis horse, and assented to such orders as Mr. Robarts gave them,--no\ndoubt with much surprise, but nevertheless in absolute silence.\n\n\"Now, Grace, be quick, there's a dear,\" said Lucy, returning with\nthe infant in her arms. \"And, Grace, mind you are very careful about\nbaby; and bring the basket; I'll give it you when you are in.\" Grace\nand the other child were then packed on to the other seat, and a\nbasket with children's clothes put in on the top of them. \"That'll\ndo, Mark; good-bye; tell Fanny to be sure and send the day after\nto-morrow, and not to forget--\" and then she whispered into her\nbrother's ear an injunction about certain dairy comforts which might\nnot be spoken of in the hearing of Mr. Crawley. \"Good-bye, dears;\nmind you are good children; you shall hear about mamma the day after\nto-morrow,\" said Lucy; and Puck, admonished by a sound from his\nmaster's voice, began to move just as Mr. Crawley reappeared at the\nhouse door.\n\n\"Oh, oh, stop!\" he said. \"Miss Robarts, you really had better not--\"\n\n\"Go on, Mark,\" said Lucy, in a whisper, which, whether audible or not\nby Mr. Crawley, was heard very plainly by the dean. And Mark, who had\nslightly arrested Puck by the reins on the appearance of Mr. Crawley,\nnow touched the impatient little beast with his whip; and the vehicle\nwith its freight darted off rapidly, Puck shaking his head and going\naway with a tremendously quick short trot which soon separated Mr.\nCrawley from his family.\n\n\"Miss Robarts,\" he began, \"this step has been taken altogether\nwithout--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said she, interrupting him. \"My brother was obliged to return\nat once. The children, you know, will remain all together at the\nparsonage; and that, I think, is what Mrs. Crawley will best like. In\na day or two they will be under Mrs. Robarts's own charge.\"\n\n\"But, my dear Miss Robarts, I had no intention whatever of putting\nthe burden of my family on the shoulders of another person. They must\nreturn to their own home immediately--that is, as soon as they can be\nbrought back.\"\n\n\"I really think Miss Robarts has managed very well,\" said the dean.\n\"Mrs. Crawley must be so much more comfortable to think that they are\nout of danger.\"\n\n\"And they will be quite comfortable at the parsonage,\" said Lucy.\n\n\"I do not at all doubt that,\" said Mr. Crawley; \"but too much of such\ncomforts will unfit them for their home; and--and I could have wished\nthat I had been consulted more at leisure before the proceeding had\nbeen taken.\"\n\n\"It was arranged, Mr. Crawley, when I was here before, that the\nchildren had better go away,\" pleaded Lucy.\n\n\"I do not remember agreeing to such a measure, Miss Robarts;\nhowever-- I suppose they cannot be had back to-night?\"\n\n\"No, not to-night,\" said Lucy. \"And now I will go in to your wife.\"\nAnd then she returned to the house, leaving the two gentlemen at the\ndoor. At this moment a labourer's boy came sauntering by, and the\ndean, obtaining possession of his services for the custody of his\nhorse, was able to dismount and put himself on a more equal footing\nfor conversation with his friend.\n\n\"Crawley,\" said he, putting his hand affectionately on his friend's\nshoulder, as they both stood leaning on the little rail before the\ndoor; \"that is a good girl--a very good girl.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said he slowly; \"she means well.\"\n\n\"Nay, but she does well; she does excellently. What can be better\nthan her conduct now? While I was meditating how I might possibly\nassist your wife in this strait--\"\n\n\"I want no assistance; none, at least, from man,\" said Crawley,\nbitterly.\n\n\"Oh, my friend, think of what you are saying! Think of the wickedness\nwhich must accompany such a state of mind! Have you ever known any\nman able to walk alone, without assistance from his brother men?\"\n\nMr. Crawley did not make any immediate answer, but putting his arms\nbehind his back and closing his hands, as was his wont when he walked\nalone thinking of the general bitterness of his lot in life, began to\nmove slowly along the road in front of his house. He did not invite\nthe other to walk with him, but neither was there anything in his\nmanner which seemed to indicate that he had intended to be left to\nhimself. It was a beautiful summer afternoon, at that delicious\nperiod of the year when summer has just burst forth from the growth\nof spring; when the summer is yet but three days old, and all the\nvarious shades of green which nature can put forth are still in their\nunsoiled purity of freshness. The apple blossoms were on the trees,\nand the hedges were sweet with May. The cuckoo at five o'clock was\nstill sounding his soft summer call with unabated energy, and even\nthe common grasses of the hedgerows were sweet with the fragrance of\ntheir new growth. The foliage of the oaks was complete, so that every\nbough and twig was clothed; but the leaves did not yet hang heavy in\nmasses, and the bend of every bough and the tapering curve of every\ntwig were visible through their light green covering. There is no\ntime of the year equal in beauty to the first week in summer; and\nno colour which nature gives, not even the gorgeous hues of autumn,\nwhich can equal the verdure produced by the first warm suns of May.\n\nHogglestock, as has been explained, has little to offer in the way\nof landskip beauty, and the clergyman's house at Hogglestock was not\nplaced on a green slopy bank of land, retired from the road, with its\nwindows opening on to a lawn, surrounded by shrubs, with a view of\nthe small church tower seen through them; it had none of that beauty\nwhich is so common to the cozy houses of our spiritual pastors in\nthe agricultural parts of England. Hogglestock Parsonage stood bleak\nbeside the road, with no pretty paling lined inside by hollies and\nlaburnum, Portugal laurels and rose-trees. But, nevertheless, even\nHogglestock was pretty now. There were apple-trees there covered with\nblossom, and the hedgerows were in full flower. There were thrushes\nsinging, and here and there an oak-tree stood in the roadside,\nperfect in its solitary beauty.\n\n\"Let us walk on a little,\" said the dean. \"Miss Robarts is with her\nnow, and you will be better for leaving the room for a few minutes.\"\n\n\"No,\" said he; \"I must go back; I cannot leave that young lady to do\nmy work.\"\n\n\"Stop, Crawley!\" And the dean, putting his hand upon him, stayed him\nin the road. \"She is doing her own work, and if you were speaking of\nher with reference to any other household than your own, you would\nsay so. Is it not a comfort to you to know that your wife has a woman\nnear her at such a time as this; and a woman, too, who can speak to\nher as one lady does to another?\"\n\n\"These are comforts which we have no right to expect. I could not\nhave done much for poor Mary; but what a man could have done should\nnot have been wanting.\"\n\n\"I am sure of it; I know it well. What any man could do by himself\nyou would do--excepting one thing.\" And the dean as he spoke looked\nfull into the other's face.\n\n\"And what is there I would not do?\" said Crawley.\n\n\"Sacrifice your own pride.\"\n\n\"My pride?\"\n\n\"Yes; your own pride.\"\n\n\"I have had but little pride this many a day. Arabin, you do not know\nwhat my life has been. How is a man to be proud who--\" And then he\nstopped himself, not wishing to go through the catalogue of those\ngrievances, which, as he thought, had killed the very germs of pride\nwithin him, or to insist by spoken words on his poverty, his wants,\nand the injustice of his position. \"No; I wish I could be proud; but\nthe world has been too heavy to me, and I have forgotten all that.\"\n\n\"How long have I known you, Crawley?\"\n\n\"How long? Ah dear! a life-time nearly, now.\"\n\n\"And we were like brothers once.\"\n\n\"Yes; we were equal as brothers then--in our fortunes, our tastes,\nand our modes of life.\"\n\n\"And yet you would begrudge me the pleasure of putting my hand in my\npocket, and relieving the inconveniences which have been thrown on\nyou, and those you love better than yourself, by the chances of your\nfate in life.\"\n\n\"I will live on no man's charity,\" said Crawley, with an abruptness\nwhich amounted almost to an expression of anger.\n\n\"And is not that pride?\"\n\n\"No--yes;--it is a species of pride, but not that pride of which\nyou spoke. A man cannot be honest if he have not some pride. You\nyourself;--would you not rather starve than become a beggar?\"\n\n\"I would rather beg than see my wife starve,\" said Arabin.\n\nCrawley when he heard these words turned sharply round, and stood\nwith his back to the dean, with his hands still behind him, and with\nhis eyes fixed upon the ground.\n\n\"But in this case there is no question of begging,\" continued the\ndean. \"I, out of those superfluities which it has pleased God to put\nat my disposal, am anxious to assist the needs of those whom I love.\"\n\n\"She is not starving,\" said Crawley, in a voice very bitter, but\nstill intended to be exculpatory of himself.\n\n\"No, my dear friend; I know she is not, and do not you be angry\nwith me because I have endeavoured to put the matter to you in the\nstrongest language I could use.\"\n\n\"You look at it, Arabin, from one side only; I can only look at it\nfrom the other. It is very sweet to give; I do not doubt that. But\nthe taking of what is given is very bitter. Gift bread chokes in\na man's throat and poisons his blood, and sits like lead upon the\nheart. You have never tried it.\"\n\n\"But that is the very fault for which I blame you. That is the pride\nwhich I say you ought to sacrifice.\"\n\n\"And why should I be called on to do so? Is not the labourer worthy\nof his hire? Am I not able to work, and willing? Have I not always\nhad my shoulder to the collar, and is it right that I should now be\ncontented with the scraps from a rich man's kitchen? Arabin, you\nand I were equal once and we were then friends, understanding each\nother's thoughts and sympathizing with each other's sorrows. But it\ncannot be so now.\"\n\n\"If there be such inability, it is all with you.\"\n\n\"It is all with me,--because in our connection the pain would all be\non my side. It would not hurt you to see me at your table with worn\nshoes and a ragged shirt. I do not think so meanly of you as that.\nYou would give me your feast to eat though I were not clad a tithe as\nwell as the menial behind your chair. But it would hurt me to know\nthat there were those looking at me who thought me unfit to sit in\nyour rooms.\"\n\n\"That is the pride of which I speak;--false pride.\"\n\n\"Call it so if you will; but, Arabin, no preaching of yours can alter\nit. It is all that is left to me of my manliness. That poor broken\nreed who is lying there sick,--who has sacrificed all the world to\nher love for me,--who is the mother of my children, and the partner\nof my sorrows and the wife of my bosom,--even she cannot change me in\nthis, though she pleads with the eloquence of all her wants. Not even\nfor her can I hold out my hand for a dole.\"\n\nThey had now come back to the door of the house, and Mr. Crawley,\nhardly conscious of what he was doing, was preparing to enter.\n\n\"Will Mrs. Crawley be able to see me if I come in?\" said the dean.\n\n\"Oh, stop; no; you had better not do so,\" said Mr. Crawley. \"You, no\ndoubt, might be subject to infection, and then Mrs. Arabin would be\nfrightened.\"\n\n\"I do not care about it in the least,\" said the dean.\n\n\"But it is of no use; you had better not. Her room, I fear, is\nquite unfit for you to see; and the whole house, you know, may be\ninfected.\"\n\nDr. Arabin by this time was in the sitting-room; but seeing that his\nfriend was really anxious that he should not go farther, he did not\npersist.\n\n\"It will be a comfort to us, at any rate, to know that Miss Robarts\nis with her.\"\n\n\"The young lady is very good--very good indeed,\" said Crawley; \"but\nI trust she will return to her home to-morrow. It is impossible that\nshe should remain in so poor a house as mine. There will be nothing\nhere of all the things that she will want.\"\n\nThe dean thought that Lucy Robarts's wants during her present\noccupation of nursing would not be so numerous as to make her\ncontinued sojourn in Mrs. Crawley's sick room impossible, and\ntherefore took his leave with a satisfied conviction that the poor\nlady would not be left wholly to the somewhat unskilful nursing of\nher husband.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\n\nMR. SOWERBY WITHOUT COMPANY.\n\n\nAnd now there were going to be wondrous doings in West Barsetshire,\nand men's minds were much disturbed. The fiat had gone forth from the\nhigh places, and the Queen had dissolved her faithful Commons. The\ngiants, finding that they could effect little or nothing with the old\nHouse, had resolved to try what a new venture would do for them, and\nthe hubbub of a general election was to pervade the country. This\nproduced no inconsiderable irritation and annoyance, for the House\nwas not as yet quite three years old; and members of Parliament,\nthough they naturally feel a constitutional pleasure in meeting\ntheir friends and in pressing the hands of their constituents, are,\nnevertheless, so far akin to the lower order of humanity that they\nappreciate the danger of losing their seats; and the certainty of\na considerable outlay in their endeavours to retain them is not\nagreeable to the legislative mind.\n\nNever did the old family fury between the gods and giants rage higher\nthan at the present moment. The giants declared that every turn which\nthey attempted to take in their country's service had been thwarted\nby faction, in spite of those benign promises of assistance made\nto them only a few weeks since by their opponents; and the gods\nanswered by asserting that they were driven to this opposition by\nthe Boeotian fatuity of the giants. They had no doubt promised\ntheir aid, and were ready to give it to measures that were decently\nprudent; but not to a bill enabling government at its will to pension\naged bishops! No; there must be some limit to their tolerance, and\nwhen such attempts as these were made that limit had been clearly\npassed.\n\nAll this had taken place openly only a day or two after that casual\nwhisper dropped by Tom Towers at Miss Dunstable's party--by Tom\nTowers, that most pleasant of all pleasant fellows. And how should\nhe have known it,--he who flutters from one sweetest flower of the\ngarden to another,\n\n   \"Adding sugar to the pink, and honey to the rose,\n    So loved for what he gives, but taking nothing as he goes\"?\n\nBut the whisper had grown into a rumour, and the rumour into a\nfact, and the political world was in a ferment. The giants, furious\nabout their bishops' pension bill, threatened the House--most\ninjudiciously; and then it was beautiful to see how indignant members\ngot up, glowing with honesty, and declared that it was base to\nconceive that any gentleman in that House could be actuated in his\nvote by any hopes or fears with reference to his seat. And so matters\ngrew from bad to worse, and these contending parties never hit at\neach other with such envenomed wrath as they did now;--having entered\nthe ring together so lately with such manifold promises of good-will,\nrespect, and forbearance!\n\nBut going from the general to the particular, we may say that nowhere\nwas a deeper consternation spread than in the electoral division\nof West Barsetshire. No sooner had the tidings of the dissolution\nreached the county than it was known that the duke intended to change\nhis nominee. Mr. Sowerby had now sat for the division since the\nReform Bill! He had become one of the county institutions, and by the\ndint of custom and long establishment had been borne with and even\nliked by the county gentlemen, in spite of his well-known pecuniary\nirregularities. Now all this was to be changed. No reason had as yet\nbeen publicly given, but it was understood that Lord Dumbello was to\nbe returned, although he did not own an acre of land in the county.\nIt is true that rumour went on to say that Lord Dumbello was about\nto form close connections with Barsetshire. He was on the eve of\nmarrying a young lady, from the other division indeed, and was\nnow engaged, so it was said, in completing arrangements with the\ngovernment for the purchase of that noble crown property usually\nknown as the Chace of Chaldicotes. It was also stated--this\nstatement, however, had hitherto been only announced in confidential\nwhispers--that Chaldicotes House itself would soon become the\nresidence of the marquis. The duke was claiming it as his own--would\nvery shortly have completed his claims and taken possession;--and\nthen, by some arrangement between them, it was to be made over to\nLord Dumbello.\n\nBut very contrary rumours to these got abroad also. Men said--such\nas dared to oppose the duke, and some few also who did not dare\nto oppose him when the day of battle came--that it was beyond his\ngrace's power to turn Lord Dumbello into a Barsetshire magnate. The\ncrown property--such men said--was to fall into the hands of young\nMr. Gresham, of Boxall Hill, in the other division, and that the\nterms of purchase had been already settled. And as to Mr. Sowerby's\nproperty and the house of Chaldicotes--these opponents of the Omnium\ninterest went on to explain--it was by no means as yet so certain\nthat the duke would be able to enter it and take possession. The\nplace was not to be given up to him quietly. A great fight would be\nmade, and it was beginning to be believed that the enormous mortgages\nwould be paid off by a lady of immense wealth. And then a dash of\nromance was not wanting to make these stories palatable. This lady of\nimmense wealth had been courted by Mr. Sowerby, had acknowledged her\nlove,--but had refused to marry him on account of his character. In\ntestimony of her love, however, she was about to pay all his debts.\n\nIt was soon put beyond a rumour, and became manifest enough, that Mr.\nSowerby did not intend to retire from the county in obedience to the\nduke's behests. A placard was posted through the whole division in\nwhich no allusion was made by name to the duke, but in which Mr.\nSowerby warned his friends not to be led away by any report that he\nintended to retire from the representation of West Barsetshire. \"He\nhad sat,\" the placard said, \"for the same county during the full\nperiod of a quarter of a century, and he would not lightly give up an\nhonour that had been extended to him so often and which he prized so\ndearly. There were but few men now in the House whose connection with\nthe same body of constituents had remained unbroken so long as had\nthat which bound him to West Barsetshire; and he confidently hoped\nthat that connection might be continued through another period of\ncoming years till he might find himself in the glorious position of\nbeing the father of the county members of the House of Commons.\" The\nplacard said much more than this, and hinted at sundry and various\nquestions, all of great interest to the county; but it did not say\none word of the Duke of Omnium, though every one knew what the\nduke was supposed to be doing in the matter. He was, as it were, a\ngreat Llama, shut up in a holy of holies, inscrutable, invisible,\ninexorable,--not to be seen by men's eyes or heard by their ears,\nhardly to be mentioned by ordinary men at such periods as these\nwithout an inward quaking. But nevertheless, it was he who was\nsupposed to rule them. Euphemism required that his name should\nbe mentioned at no public meetings in connection with the coming\nelection; but, nevertheless, most men in the county believed that\nhe could send his dog up to the House of Commons as member for West\nBarsetshire if it so pleased him.\n\nIt was supposed, therefore, that our friend Sowerby would have no\nchance; but he was lucky in finding assistance in a quarter from\nwhich he certainly had not deserved it. He had been a staunch friend\nof the gods during the whole of his political life,--as, indeed, was\nto be expected, seeing that he had been the duke's nominee; but,\nnevertheless, on the present occasion, all the giants connected with\nthe county came forward to his rescue. They did not do this with the\nacknowledged purpose of opposing the duke; they declared that they\nwere actuated by a generous disinclination to see an old county\nmember put from his seat;--but the world knew that the battle was to\nbe waged against the great Llama. It was to be a contest between the\npowers of aristocracy and the powers of oligarchy, as those powers\nexisted in West Barsetshire,--and, it may be added, that democracy\nwould have very little to say to it, on one side or on the other.\nThe lower order of voters, the small farmers and tradesmen, would no\ndoubt range themselves on the side of the duke, and would endeavour\nto flatter themselves that they were thereby furthering the views of\nthe liberal side; but they would in fact be led to the poll by an\nold-fashioned, time-honoured adherence to the will of their great\nLlama; and by an apprehension of evil if that Llama should arise and\nshake himself in his wrath. What might not come to the county if the\nLlama were to walk himself off, he with his satellites and armies and\ncourtiers? There he was, a great Llama; and though he came among them\nbut seldom, and was scarcely seen when he did come, nevertheless--and\nnot the less but rather the more--was obedience to him considered as\nsalutary and opposition regarded as dangerous. A great rural Llama is\nstill sufficiently mighty in rural England.\n\nBut the priest of the temple, Mr. Fothergill, was frequent enough\nin men's eyes, and it was beautiful to hear with how varied a voice\nhe alluded to the things around him and to the changes which were\ncoming. To the small farmers, not only on the Gatherum property\nbut on others also, he spoke of the duke as a beneficent influence,\nshedding prosperity on all around him, keeping up prices by his\npresence, and forbidding the poor rates to rise above one and\nfourpence in the pound by the general employment which he occasioned.\nMen must be mad, he thought, who would willingly fly in the duke's\nface. To the squires from a distance he declared that no one had a\nright to charge the duke with any interference;--as far, at least, as\nhe knew the duke's mind. People would talk of things of which they\nunderstood nothing. Could any one say that he had traced a single\nrequest for a vote home to the duke? All this did not alter the\nsettled conviction on men's minds; but it had its effect, and tended\nto increase the mystery in which the duke's doings were enveloped.\nBut to his own familiars, to the gentry immediately around him, Mr.\nFothergill merely winked his eye. They knew what was what, and so\ndid he. The duke had never been bit yet in such matters, and Mr.\nFothergill did not think that he would now submit himself to any such\noperation.\n\nI never heard in what manner and at what rate Mr. Fothergill received\nremuneration for the various services performed by him with reference\nto the duke's property in Barsetshire; but I am very sure that,\nwhatever might be the amount, he earned it thoroughly. Never was\nthere a more faithful partisan, or one who, in his partisanship, was\nmore discreet. In this matter of the coming election he declared\nthat he himself,--personally, on his own hook,--did intend to bestir\nhimself actively on behalf of Lord Dumbello. Mr. Sowerby was an old\nfriend of his, and a very good fellow. That was true. But all the\nworld must admit that Sowerby was not in the position which a county\nmember ought to occupy. He was a ruined man, and it would not be for\nhis own advantage that he should be maintained in a position which\nwas fit only for a man of property. He knew--he, Fothergill--that Mr.\nSowerby must abandon all right and claim to Chaldicotes; and if so,\nwhat would be more absurd than to acknowledge that he had a right and\nclaim to the seat in Parliament? As to Lord Dumbello, it was probable\nthat he would soon become one of the largest landowners in the\ncounty; and, as such, who could be more fit for the representation?\nBeyond this, Mr. Fothergill was not ashamed to confess--so he\nsaid--that he hoped to hold Lord Dumbello's agency. It would be\ncompatible with his other duties, and therefore, as a matter of\ncourse, he intended to support Lord Dumbello;--he himself, that is.\nAs to the duke's mind in the matter--! But I have already explained\nhow Mr. Fothergill disposed of that.\n\nIn these days, Mr. Sowerby came down to his own house--for ostensibly\nit was still his own house--but he came very quietly, and his arrival\nwas hardly known in his own village. Though his placard was stuck\nup so widely, he himself took no electioneering steps; none, at\nleast, as yet. The protection against arrest which he derived from\nParliament would soon be over, and those who were most bitter against\nthe duke averred that steps would be taken to arrest him, should he\ngive sufficient opportunity to the myrmidons of the law. That he\nwould, in such case, be arrested was very likely; but it was not\nlikely that this would be done in any way at the duke's instance. Mr.\nFothergill declared indignantly that this insinuation made him very\nangry; but he was too prudent a man to be very angry at anything, and\nhe knew how to make capital on his own side of charges such as these\nwhich overshot their own mark.\n\nMr. Sowerby came down very quietly to Chaldicotes, and there he\nremained for a couple of days, quite alone. The place bore a very\ndifferent aspect now to that which we noticed when Mark Robarts drove\nup to it, in the early pages of this little narrative. There were no\nlights in the windows now, and no voices came from the stables; no\ndogs barked, and all was dead and silent as the grave. During the\ngreater portion of those two days he sat alone within the house,\nalmost unoccupied. He did not even open his letters, which lay piled\non a crowded table in the small breakfast parlour in which he sat;\nfor the letters of such men come in piles, and there are few of\nthem which are pleasant in the reading. There he sat, troubled with\nthoughts which were sad enough, now and then moving to and fro the\nhouse, but for the most part occupied in thinking over the position\nto which he had brought himself. What would he be in the world's\neye, if he ceased to be the owner of Chaldicotes, and ceased also\nto be the member for his county? He had lived ever before the world,\nand, though always harassed by encumbrances, had been sustained and\ncomforted by the excitement of a prominent position. His debts and\ndifficulties had hitherto been bearable, and he had borne them with\nease so long that he had almost taught himself to think that they\nwould never be unendurable. But now,--\n\nThe order for foreclosing had gone forth, and the harpies of the law,\nby their present speed in sticking their claws into the carcase of\nhis property, were atoning to themselves for the delay with which\nthey had hitherto been compelled to approach their prey. And the\norder as to his seat had gone forth also. That placard had been drawn\nup by the combined efforts of his sister, Miss Dunstable, and a\ncertain well-known electioneering agent, named Closerstill, presumed\nto be in the interest of the giants. But poor Sowerby had but little\nconfidence in the placard. No one knew better than he how great was\nthe duke's power.\n\nHe was hopeless, therefore, as he walked about through those empty\nrooms, thinking of his past life and of that life which was to come.\nWould it not be well for him that he were dead, now that he was dying\nto all that had made the world pleasant! We see and hear of such men\nas Mr. Sowerby, and are apt to think that they enjoy all that the\nworld can give, and that they enjoy that all without payment either\nin care or labour; but I doubt that, with even the most callous\nof them, their periods of wretchedness must be frequent, and that\nwretchedness very intense. Salmon and lamb in February and green\npease and new potatoes in March can hardly make a man happy,\neven though nobody pays for them; and the feeling that one is an\n_antecedentem scelestum_ after whom a sure, though lame, Nemesis\nis hobbling, must sometimes disturb one's slumbers. On the present\noccasion Scelestus felt that his Nemesis had overtaken him. Lame as\nshe had been, and swift as he had run, she had mouthed him at last,\nand there was nothing left for him but to listen to the \"whoop\" set\nup at the sight of his own death-throes.\n\nIt was a melancholy, dreary place now, that big house of Chaldicotes;\nand though the woods were all green with their early leaves, and the\ngardens thick with flowers, they also were melancholy and dreary.\nThe lawns were untrimmed and weeds were growing through the gravel,\nand here and there a cracked Dryad, tumbled from her pedestal and\nsprawling in the grass, gave a look of disorder to the whole place.\nThe wooden trellis-work was shattered here and bending there, the\nstandard rose-trees were stooping to the ground, and the leaves of\nthe winter still encumbered the borders. Late in the evening of the\nsecond day Mr. Sowerby strolled out, and went through the gardens\ninto the wood. Of all the inanimate things of the world this wood\nof Chaldicotes was the dearest to him. He was not a man to whom his\ncompanions gave much credit for feelings or thoughts akin to poetry,\nbut here, out in the Chace, his mind would be almost poetical. While\nwandering among the forest trees, he became susceptible of the\ntenderness of human nature: he would listen to the birds singing,\nand pick here and there a wild flower on his path. He would watch\nthe decay of the old trees and the progress of the young, and make\npictures in his eyes of every turn in the wood. He would mark the\ncolour of a bit of road as it dipped into a dell, and then, passing\nthrough a water-course, rose brown, rough, irregular, and beautiful\nagainst the bank on the other side. And then he would sit and think\nof his old family: how they had roamed there time out of mind in\nthose Chaldicotes woods, father and son and grandson in regular\nsuccession, each giving them over, without blemish or decrease, to\nhis successor. So he would sit; and so he did sit even now, and,\nthinking of these things, wished that he had never been born.\n\nIt was dark night when he returned to the house, and as he did so he\nresolved that he would quit the place altogether, and give up the\nbattle as lost. The duke should take it and do as he pleased with\nit; and as for the seat in Parliament, Lord Dumbello, or any other\nequally gifted young patrician, might hold it for him. He would\nvanish from the scene and betake himself to some land from whence he\nwould be neither heard nor seen, and there--starve. Such were now his\nfuture outlooks into the world; and yet, as regards health and all\nphysical capacities, he knew that he was still in the prime of his\nlife. Yes; in the prime of his life! But what could he do with what\nremained to him of such prime? How could he turn either his mind or\nhis strength to such account as might now be serviceable? How could\nhe, in his sore need, earn for himself even the barest bread? Would\nit not be better for him that he should die? Let not any one covet\nthe lot of a spendthrift, even though the days of his early pease and\nchampagne seem to be unnumbered; for that lame Nemesis will surely be\nup before the game has been all played out.\n\nWhen Mr. Sowerby reached his house he found that a message by\ntelegraph had arrived for him in his absence. It was from his sister,\nand it informed him that she would be with him that night. She was\ncoming down by the mail train, had telegraphed to Barchester for\npost-horses, and would be at Chaldicotes about two hours after\nmidnight. It was therefore manifest enough that her business was of\nimportance.\n\nExactly at two the Barchester post-chaise did arrive, and Mrs. Harold\nSmith, before she retired to her bed, was closeted for about an hour\nwith her brother.\n\n\"Well,\" she said, the following morning, as they sat together at the\nbreakfast-table, \"what do you say to it now? If you accept her offer\nyou should be with her lawyer this afternoon.\"\n\n\"I suppose I must accept it,\" said he.\n\n\"Certainly, I think so. No doubt it will take the property out of\nyour own hands as completely as though the duke had it, but it will\nleave you the house, at any rate, for your life.\"\n\n\"What good will the house be, when I can't keep it up?\"\n\n\"But I am not so sure of that. She will not want more than her fair\ninterest; and as it will be thoroughly well managed, I should think\nthat there would be something over--something enough to keep up the\nhouse. And then, you know, we must have some place in the country.\"\n\n\"I tell you fairly, Harriet, that I will have nothing further to do\nwith Harold in the way of money.\"\n\n\"Ah! that was because you would go to him. Why did you not come to\nme? And then, Nathaniel, it is the only way in which you can have a\nchance of keeping the seat. She is the queerest woman I ever met, but\nshe seems resolved on beating the duke.\"\n\n\"I do not quite understand it, but I have not the slightest\nobjection.\"\n\n\"She thinks that he is interfering with young Gresham about the crown\nproperty. I had no idea that she had so much business at her fingers'\nends. When I first proposed the matter she took it up quite as a\nlawyer might, and seemed to have forgotten altogether what occurred\nabout that other matter.\"\n\n\"I wish I could forget it also,\" said Mr. Sowerby.\n\n\"I really think that she does. When I was obliged to make some\nallusion to it--at least I felt myself obliged, and was sorry\nafterwards that I did--she merely laughed--a great loud laugh as she\nalways does, and then went on about the business. However, she was\nclear about this, that all the expenses of the election should be\nadded to the sum to be advanced by her, and that the house should be\nleft to you without any rent. If you choose to take the land round\nthe house you must pay for it, by the acre, as the tenants do. She\nwas as clear about it all as though she had passed her life in a\nlawyer's office.\"\n\nMy readers will now pretty well understand what last step that\nexcellent sister, Mrs. Harold Smith, had taken on her brother's\nbehalf, nor will they be surprised to learn that in the course of\nthe day Mr. Sowerby hurried back to town and put himself into\ncommunication with Miss Dunstable's lawyer.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\n\nIS THERE CAUSE OR JUST IMPEDIMENT?\n\n\nI now purpose to visit another country house in Barsetshire, but\non this occasion our sojourn shall be in the eastern division, in\nwhich, as in every other county in England, electioneering matters\nare paramount at the present moment. It has been mentioned that Mr.\nGresham, junior, young Frank Gresham as he was always called, lived\nat a place called Boxall Hill. This property had come to his wife by\nwill, and he was now settled there,--seeing that his father still\nheld the family seat of the Greshams at Greshamsbury.\n\nAt the present moment Miss Dunstable was staying at Boxall Hill\nwith Mrs. Frank Gresham. They had left London,--as, indeed, all the\nworld had done, to the terrible dismay of the London tradesmen. This\ndissolution of Parliament was ruining everybody except the country\npublicans, and had of course destroyed the London season among other\nthings.\n\nMrs. Harold Smith had only just managed to catch Miss Dunstable\nbefore she left London; but she did do so, and the great heiress\nhad at once seen her lawyers, and instructed them how to act with\nreference to the mortgages on the Chaldicotes property. Miss\nDunstable was in the habit of speaking of herself and her own\npecuniary concerns as though she herself were rarely allowed to\nmeddle in their management; but this was one of those small jokes\nwhich she ordinarily perpetrated; for in truth few ladies, and\nperhaps not many gentlemen, have a more thorough knowledge of their\nown concerns or a more potent voice in their own affairs, than was\npossessed by Miss Dunstable. Circumstances had lately brought her\nmuch into Barsetshire and she had there contracted very intimate\nfriendships. She was now disposed to become, if possible, a\nBarsetshire proprietor, and with this view had lately agreed with\nyoung Mr. Gresham that she would become the purchaser of the Crown\nproperty. As, however, the purchase had been commenced in his name,\nit was so to be continued; but now, as we are aware, it was rumoured\nthat, after all, the duke, or, if not the duke, then the Marquis of\nDumbello, was to be the future owner of the Chace. Miss Dunstable,\nhowever, was not a person to give up her object if she could attain\nit, nor, under the circumstances, was she at all displeased at\nfinding herself endowed with the power of rescuing the Sowerby\nportion of the Chaldicotes property from the duke's clutches. Why\nhad the duke meddled with her, or with her friend, as to the other\nproperty? Therefore it was arranged that the full amount due to the\nduke on mortgage should be ready for immediate payment; but it was\narranged also that the security as held by Miss Dunstable should be\nvery valid.\n\nMiss Dunstable, at Boxall Hill or at Greshamsbury, was a very\ndifferent person from Miss Dunstable in London; and it was this\ndifference which so much vexed Mrs. Gresham; not that her friend\nomitted to bring with her into the country her London wit and\naptitude for fun, but that she did not take with her up to town the\ngenuine goodness and love of honesty which made her loveable in the\ncountry. She was as it were two persons, and Mrs. Gresham could not\nunderstand that any lady should permit herself to be more worldly at\none time of the year than at another--or in one place than in any\nother.\n\n\"Well, my dear, I am heartily glad we've done with that,\" Miss\nDunstable said to her, as she sat herself down to her desk in the\ndrawing-room on the first morning after her arrival at Boxall Hill.\n\n\n[Illustration: Mrs. Gresham and Miss Dunstable.]\n\n\n\"What does 'that' mean?\" said Mrs. Gresham.\n\n\"Why, London and smoke and late hours, and standing on one's legs\nfor four hours at a stretch on the top of one's own staircase, to be\nbowed at by any one who chooses to come. That's all done--for one\nyear, at any rate.\"\n\n\"You know you like it.\"\n\n\"No, Mary; that's just what I don't know. I don't know whether I like\nit or not. Sometimes, when the spirit of that dearest of all women,\nMrs. Harold Smith, is upon me, I think that I do like it; but then\nagain, when other spirits are on me, I think that I don't.\"\n\n\"And who are the owners of the other spirits?\"\n\n\"Oh! you are one, of course. But you are a weak little thing, by no\nmeans able to contend with such a Samson as Mrs. Harold. And then you\nare a little given to wickedness yourself, you know. You've learned\nto like London well enough since you sat down to the table of Dives.\nYour uncle,--he's the real impracticable, unapproachable Lazarus who\ndeclares that he can't come down because of the big gulf. I wonder\nhow he'd behave, if somebody left him ten thousand a year?\"\n\n\"Uncommonly well, I am sure.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; he is a Lazarus now, so of course we are bound to speak\nwell of him; but I should like to see him tried. I don't doubt but\nwhat he'd have a house in Belgrave Square, and become noted for his\nlittle dinners before the first year of his trial was over.\"\n\n\"Well, and why not? You would not wish him to be an anchorite?\"\n\n\"I am told that he is going to try his luck,--not with ten thousand a\nyear, but with one or two.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Jane tells me that they all say at Greshamsbury that he is going to\nmarry Lady Scatcherd.\" Now Lady Scatcherd was a widow living in those\nparts; an excellent woman, but one not formed by nature to grace\nsociety of the highest order.\n\n\"What!\" exclaimed Mrs. Gresham, rising up from her chair while her\neyes flashed with anger at such a rumour.\n\n\"Well, my dear, don't eat me. I don't say it is so; I only say that\nJane said so.\"\n\n\"Then you ought to send Jane out of the house.\"\n\n\"You may be sure of this, my dear: Jane would not have told me if\nsomebody had not told her.\"\n\n\"And you believed it?\"\n\n\"I have said nothing about that.\"\n\n\"But you look as if you had believed it.\"\n\n\"Do I? Let us see what sort of a look it is, this look of faith.\"\nAnd Miss Dunstable got up and went to the glass over the fire-place.\n\"But, Mary, my dear, ain't you old enough to know that you should not\ncredit people's looks? You should believe nothing now-a-days; and\nI did not believe the story about poor Lady Scatcherd. I know the\ndoctor well enough to be sure that he is not a marrying man.\"\n\n\"What a nasty, hackneyed, false phrase that is--that of a marrying\nman! It sounds as though some men were in the habit of getting\nmarried three or four times a month.\"\n\n\"It means a great deal all the same. One can tell very soon whether a\nman is likely to marry or no.\"\n\n\"And can one tell the same of a woman?\"\n\n\"The thing is so different. All unmarried women are necessarily in\nthe market; but if they behave themselves properly they make no\nsigns. Now there was Griselda Grantly; of course she intended to get\nherself a husband, and a very grand one she has got; but she always\nlooked as though butter would not melt in her mouth. It would have\nbeen very wrong to call her a marrying girl.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course she was,\" says Mrs. Gresham, with that sort of\nacrimony which one pretty young woman so frequently expresses with\nreference to another. \"But if one could always tell of a woman, as\nyou say you can of a man, I should be able to tell of you. Now, I\nwonder whether you are a marrying woman? I have never been able to\nmake up my mind yet.\"\n\nMiss Dunstable remained silent for a few moments, as though she were\nat first minded to take the question as being, in some sort, one made\nin earnest; but then she attempted to laugh it off. \"Well, I wonder\nat that,\" said she, \"as it was only the other day I told you how many\noffers I had refused.\"\n\n\"Yes; but you did not tell me whether any had been made that you\nmeant to accept.\"\n\n\"None such was ever made to me. Talking of that, I shall never forget\nyour cousin, the Honourable George.\"\n\n\"He is not my cousin.\"\n\n\"Well, your husband's. It would not be fair to show a man's letters;\nbut I should like to show you his.\"\n\n\"You are determined, then, to remain single?\"\n\n\"I didn't say that. But why do you cross-question me so?\"\n\n\"Because I think so much about you. I am afraid that you will become\nso afraid of men's motives as to doubt that any one can be honest.\nAnd yet sometimes I think you would be a happier woman and a better\nwoman, if you were married.\"\n\n\"To such an one as the Honourable George, for instance?\"\n\n\"No, not to such an one as him; you have probably picked out the\nworst.\"\n\n\"Or to Mr. Sowerby?\"\n\n\"Well, no; not to Mr. Sowerby, either. I would not have you marry any\nman that looked to you for your money principally.\"\n\n\"And how is it possible that I should expect any one to look to me\nprincipally for anything else? You don't see my difficulty, my dear?\nIf I had only five hundred a year, I might come across some decent\nmiddle-aged personage, like myself, who would like me, myself, pretty\nwell, and would like my little income--pretty well also. He would not\ntell me any violent lie, and perhaps no lie at all. I should take to\nhim in the same sort of way, and we might do very well. But, as it\nis, how is it possible that any disinterested person should learn to\nlike me? How could such a man set about it? If a sheep have two\nheads, is not the fact of the two heads the first and, indeed, only\nthing which the world regards in that sheep? Must it not be so as a\nmatter of course? I am a sheep with two heads. All this money which\nmy father put together, and which has been growing since like grass\nunder May showers, has turned me into an abortion. I am not the\ngiantess eight feet high, or the dwarf that stands in the man's\nhand,--\"\n\n\"Or the two-headed sheep--\"\n\n\"But I am the unmarried woman with--half a dozen millions of\nmoney--as I believe some people think. Under such circumstances have\nI a fair chance of getting my own sweet bit of grass to nibble, like\nany ordinary animal with one head? I never was very beautiful, and I\nam not more so now than I was fifteen years ago.\"\n\n\"I am quite sure it is not that which hinders it. You would not call\nyourself plain; and even plain women are married every day, and are\nloved, too, as well as pretty women.\"\n\n\"Are they? Well, we won't say more about that; but I don't expect a\ngreat many lovers on account of my beauty. If ever you hear of such\nan one, mind you tell me.\"\n\nIt was almost on Mrs. Gresham's tongue to say that she did know of\none such--meaning her uncle. But in truth, she did not know any such\nthing; nor could she boast to herself that she had good grounds for\nfeeling that it was so--certainly none sufficient to justify her in\nspeaking of it. Her uncle had said no word to her on the matter, and\nhad been confused and embarrassed when the idea of such a marriage\nwas hinted to him. But, nevertheless, Mrs. Gresham did think that\neach of these two was well inclined to love the other, and that they\nwould be happier together than they would be single. The difficulty,\nhowever, was very great, for the doctor would be terribly afraid of\nbeing thought covetous in regard to Miss Dunstable's money; and it\nwould hardly be expected that she should be induced to make the first\noverture to the doctor.\n\n\"My uncle would be the only man that I can think of that would be at\nall fit for you,\" said Mrs. Gresham, boldly.\n\n\"What, and rob poor Lady Scatcherd!\" said Miss Dunstable.\n\n\"Oh, very well. If you choose to make a joke of his name in that way,\nI have done.\"\n\n\"Why, God bless the girl! what does she want me to say? And as for\njoking, surely that is innocent enough. You're as tender about the\ndoctor as though he were a girl of seventeen.\"\n\n\"It's not about him; but it's such a shame to laugh at poor dear Lady\nScatcherd. If she were to hear it she'd lose all comfort in having my\nuncle near her.\"\n\n\"And I'm to marry him, so that she may be safe with her friend!\"\n\n\"Very well; I have done.\" And Mrs. Gresham, who had already got up\nfrom her seat, employed herself very sedulously in arranging flowers\nwhich had been brought in for the drawing-room tables. Thus they\nremained silent for a minute or two, during which she began to\nreflect that, after all, it might probably be thought that she also\nwas endeavouring to catch the great heiress for her uncle.\n\n\"And now you are angry with me,\" said Miss Dunstable.\n\n\"No, I am not.\"\n\n\"Oh, but you are. Do you think I'm such a fool as not to see when a\nperson's vexed? You wouldn't have twitched that geranium's head off\nif you'd been in a proper frame of mind.\"\n\n\"I don't like that joke about Lady Scatcherd.\"\n\n\"And is that all, Mary? Now do try and be true, if you can. You\nremember the bishop? _Magna est veritas._\"\n\n\"The fact is you've got into such a way of being sharp, and saying\nsharp things among your friends up in London, that you can hardly\nanswer a person without it.\"\n\n\"Can't I? Dear, dear, what a Mentor you are, Mary! No poor lad that\never ran up from Oxford for a spree in town got so lectured for his\ndissipation and iniquities as I do. Well, I beg Dr. Thorne's pardon,\nand Lady Scatcherd's, and I won't be sharp any more; and I will--let\nme see, what was it I was to do? Marry him myself, I believe; was not\nthat it?\"\n\n\"No; you're not half good enough for him.\"\n\n\"I know that. I'm quite sure of that. Though I am so sharp, I'm very\nhumble. You can't accuse me of putting any very great value on\nmyself.\"\n\n\"Perhaps not as much as you ought to do--on yourself.\"\n\n\"Now, what do you mean, Mary? I won't be bullied and teased, and have\ninnuendos thrown out at me, because you've got something on your\nmind, and don't quite dare to speak it out. If you have got anything\nto say, say it.\"\n\nBut Mrs. Gresham did not choose to say it at that moment. She held\nher peace, and went on arranging her flowers--now with a more\nsatisfied air, and without destruction to the geraniums. And when she\nhad grouped her bunches properly she carried the jar from one part of\nthe room to another, backwards and forwards, trying the effect of the\ncolours, as though her mind was quite intent upon her flowers, and\nwas for the moment wholly unoccupied with any other subject.\n\nBut Miss Dunstable was not the woman to put up with this. She sat\nsilent in her place, while her friend made one or two turns about the\nroom; and then she got up from her seat also. \"Mary,\" she said, \"give\nover about those wretched bits of green branches and leave the jars\nwhere they are. You're trying to fidget me into a passion.\"\n\n\"Am I?\" said Mrs. Gresham, standing opposite to a big bowl, and\nputting her head a little on one side, as though she could better\nlook at her handiwork in that position.\n\n\"You know you are; and it's all because you lack courage to speak\nout. You didn't begin at me in this way for nothing.\"\n\n\"I do lack courage. That's just it,\" said Mrs. Gresham, still giving\na twist here and a set there to some of the small sprigs which\nconstituted the background of her bouquet. \"I do lack courage--to\nhave ill motives imputed to me. I was thinking of saying something,\nand I am afraid, and therefore I will not say it. And now, if you\nlike, I will be ready to take you out in ten minutes.\"\n\nBut Miss Dunstable was not going to be put off in this way. And to\ntell the truth, I must admit that her friend Mrs. Gresham was not\nusing her altogether well. She should either have held her peace on\nthe matter altogether,--which would probably have been her wiser\ncourse,--or she should have declared her own ideas boldly, feeling\nsecure in her own conscience as to her own motives. \"I shall not stir\nfrom this room,\" said Miss Dunstable, \"till I have had this matter\nout with you. And as for imputations,--my imputing bad motives to\nyou,--I don't know how far you may be joking, and saying what you\ncall sharp things to me; but you have no right to think that I should\nthink evil of you. If you really do think so, it is treason to the\nlove I have for you. If I thought that you thought so, I could not\nremain in the house with you. What! you are not able to know the\ndifference which one makes between one's real friends and one's mock\nfriends! I don't believe it of you, and I know you are only striving\nto bully me.\" And Miss Dunstable now took her turn of walking up and\ndown the room.\n\n\"Well, she shan't be bullied,\" said Mrs. Gresham, leaving her\nflowers, and putting her arm round her friend's waist;--\"at least,\nnot here, in this house, although she is sometimes such a bully\nherself.\"\n\n\"Mary, you have gone too far about this to go back. Tell me what\nit was that was on your mind, and as far as it concerns me, I will\nanswer you honestly.\"\n\nMrs. Gresham now began to repent that she had made her little\nattempt. That uttering of hints in a half-joking way was all very\nwell, and might possibly bring about the desired result, without the\nnecessity of any formal suggestion on her part; but now she was so\nbrought to book that she must say something formal. She must commit\nherself to the expression of her own wishes, and to an expression\nalso of an opinion as to what had been the wishes of her friend; and\nthis she must do without being able to say anything as to the wishes\nof that third person.\n\n\"Well,\" she said, \"I suppose you know what I meant.\"\n\n\"I suppose I did,\" said Miss Dunstable; \"but it is not at all the\nless necessary that you should say it out. I am not to commit myself\nby my interpretation of your thoughts, while you remain perfectly\nsecure in having only hinted your own. I hate hints, as I do--the\nmischief. I go in for the bishop's doctrine. _Magna est veritas._\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know,\" said Mrs. Gresham.\n\n\"Ah! but I do,\" said Miss Dunstable. \"And therefore go on, or for\never hold your peace.\"\n\n\"That's just it,\" said Mrs. Gresham.\n\n\"What's just it?\" said Miss Dunstable.\n\n\"The quotation out of the Prayer Book which you finished just now.\n'If any of you know cause or just impediment why these two persons\nshould not be joined together in holy matrimony, ye are to declare\nit. This is the first time of asking.' Do you know any cause, Miss\nDunstable?\"\n\n\"Do you know any, Mrs. Gresham?\"\n\n\"None, on my honour!\" said the younger lady, putting her hand upon\nher breast.\n\n\"Ah! but do you not?\" and Miss Dunstable caught hold of her arm, and\nspoke almost abruptly in her energy.\n\n\"No, certainly not. What impediment? If I did, I should not have\nbroached the subject. I declare I think you would both be very happy\ntogether. Of course, there is one impediment; we all know that. That\nmust be your look out.\"\n\n\"What do you mean? What impediment?\"\n\n\"Your own money.\"\n\n\"Psha! Did you find that an impediment in marrying Frank Gresham?\"\n\n\"Ah! the matter was so different there. He had much more to give than\nI had, when all was counted. And I had no money when we--when we were\nfirst engaged.\" And the tears came into her eyes as she thought of\nthe circumstances of her early love;--all of which have been narrated\nin the county chronicles of Barsetshire, and may now be read by men\nand women interested therein.\n\n\"Yes; yours was a love match. I declare, Mary, I often think that you\nare the happiest woman of whom I ever heard; to have it all to give,\nwhen you were so sure that you were loved while you yet had nothing.\"\n\n\"Yes; I was sure,\" and she wiped the sweet tears from her eyes, as\nshe remembered a certain day when a certain youth had come to her,\nclaiming all kinds of privileges in a very determined manner. She had\nbeen no heiress then. \"Yes; I was sure. But now with you, dear, you\ncan't make yourself poor again. If you can trust no one--\"\n\n\"I can. I can trust him. As regards that I do trust him altogether.\nBut how can I tell that he would care for me?\"\n\n\"Do you not know that he likes you?\"\n\n\"Ah, yes; and so he does Lady Scatcherd.\"\n\n\"Miss Dunstable!\"\n\n\"And why not Lady Scatcherd, as well as me? We are of the same\nkind--come from the same class.\"\n\n\"Not quite that, I think.\"\n\n\"Yes, from the same class; only I have managed to poke myself up\namong dukes and duchesses, whereas she has been content to remain\nwhere God placed her. Where I beat her in art, she beats me in\nnature.\"\n\n\"You know you are talking nonsense.\"\n\n\"I think that we are both doing that--absolute nonsense; such as\nschoolgirls of eighteen talk to each other. But there is a relief in\nit; is there not? It would be a terrible curse to have to talk sense\nalways. Well, that's done; and now let us go out.\"\n\nMrs. Gresham was sure after this that Miss Dunstable would be a\nconsenting party to the little arrangement which she contemplated.\nBut of that she had felt but little doubt for some considerable time\npast. The difficulty lay on the other side, and all that she had as\nyet done was to convince herself that she would be safe in assuring\nher uncle of success if he could be induced to take the enterprise in\nhand. He was to come to Boxall Hill that evening, and to remain there\nfor a day or two. If anything could be done in the matter, now would\nbe the time for doing it. So at least thought Mrs. Gresham.\n\nThe doctor did come, and did remain for the allotted time at Boxall\nHill; but when he left, Mrs. Gresham had not been successful. Indeed,\nhe did not seem to enjoy his visit as was usual with him; and there\nwas very little of that pleasant friendly intercourse which for some\ntime past had been customary between him and Miss Dunstable. There\nwere no passages of arms between them; no abuse from the doctor\nagainst the lady's London gaiety; no raillery from the lady as to\nthe doctor's country habits. They were very courteous to each other,\nand, as Mrs. Gresham thought, too civil by half; nor, as far as she\ncould see, did they ever remain alone in each other's company for\nfive minutes at a time during the whole period of the doctor's visit.\nWhat, thought Mrs. Gresham to herself,--what if she had set these two\nfriends at variance with each other, instead of binding them together\nin the closest and most durable friendship!\n\nBut still she had an idea that, as she had begun to play this game,\nshe must play it out. She felt conscious that what she had done must\ndo evil, unless she could so carry it on as to make it result in\ngood. Indeed, unless she could so manage, she would have done a\nmanifest injury to Miss Dunstable in forcing her to declare her\nthoughts and feelings. She had already spoken to her uncle in London,\nand though he had said nothing to show that he approved of her\nplan, neither had he said anything to show that he disapproved it.\nTherefore she had hoped through the whole of those three days that he\nwould make some sign,--at any rate to her; that he would in some way\ndeclare what were his own thoughts on this matter. But the morning of\nhis departure came, and he had declared nothing.\n\n\"Uncle,\" she said, in the last five minutes of his sojourn there,\nafter he had already taken leave of Miss Dunstable and shaken hands\nwith Mrs. Gresham, \"have you ever thought of what I said to you up in\nLondon?\"\n\n\"Yes, Mary; of course I have thought about it. Such an idea as that,\nwhen put into a man's head, will make itself thought about.\"\n\n\"Well; and what next? Do talk to me about it. Do not be so hard and\nunlike yourself.\"\n\n\"I have very little to say about it.\"\n\n\"I can tell you this for certain, you may if you like.\"\n\n\"Mary! Mary!\"\n\n\"I would not say so if I were not sure that I should not lead you\ninto trouble.\"\n\n\"You are foolish in wishing this, my dear; foolish in trying to tempt\nan old man into a folly.\"\n\n\"Not foolish if I know that it will make you both happier.\"\n\nHe made her no further reply, but stooping down that she might kiss\nhim, as was his wont, went his way, leaving her almost miserable in\nthe thought that she had troubled all these waters to no purpose.\nWhat would Miss Dunstable think of her? But on that afternoon Miss\nDunstable seemed to be as happy and even-tempered as ever.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\n\nHOW TO WRITE A LOVE LETTER.\n\n\nDr. Thorne, in the few words which he spoke to his niece before he\nleft Boxall Hill, had called himself an old man; but he was as yet on\nthe right side of sixty by five good years, and bore about with him\nless of the marks of age than most men of fifty-five do bear. One\nwould have said in looking at him that there was no reason why he\nshould not marry if he found that such a step seemed good to him;\nand looking at the age of the proposed bride, there was nothing\nunsuitable in that respect.\n\nBut nevertheless he felt almost ashamed of himself, in that he\nallowed himself even to think of the proposition which his niece had\nmade. He mounted his horse that day at Boxall Hill--for he made all\nhis journeys about the county on horseback--and rode slowly home to\nGreshamsbury, thinking not so much of the suggested marriage as of\nhis own folly in thinking of it. How could he be such an ass at his\ntime of life as to allow the even course of his way to be disturbed\nby any such idea? Of course he could not propose to himself such a\nwife as Miss Dunstable without having some thoughts as to her wealth;\nand it had been the pride of his life so to live that the world might\nknow that he was indifferent about money. His profession was all in\nall to him,--the air which he breathed as well as the bread which\nhe ate; and how could he follow his profession if he made such a\nmarriage as this? She would expect him to go to London with her; and\nwhat would he become, dangling at her heels there, known only to the\nworld as the husband of the richest woman in the town? The kind of\nlife was one which would be unsuitable to him;--and yet, as he rode\nhome, he could not resolve to rid himself of the idea. He went on\nthinking of it, though he still continued to condemn himself for\nkeeping it in his thoughts. That night at home he would make up his\nmind, so he declared to himself; and would then write to his niece\nbegging her to drop the subject. Having so far come to a resolution\nhe went on meditating what course of life it might be well for him\nto pursue if he and Miss Dunstable should, after all, become man and\nwife.\n\nThere were two ladies whom it behoved him to see on the day of\nhis arrival--whom, indeed, he generally saw every day except when\nabsent from Greshamsbury. The first of these--first in the general\nconsideration of the people of the place--was the wife of the squire,\nLady Arabella Gresham, a very old patient of the doctor's. Her it was\nhis custom to visit early in the afternoon; and then, if he were able\nto escape the squire's daily invitation to dinner, he customarily\nwent to the other, Lady Scatcherd, when the rapid meal in his own\nhouse was over. Such, at least, was his summer practice.\n\n\"Well, doctor, how are they at Boxall Hill?\" said the squire,\nwaylaying him on the gravel sweep before the door. The squire was\nvery hard set for occupation in these summer months.\n\n\"Quite well, I believe.\"\n\n\"I don't know what's come to Frank. I think he hates this place now.\nHe's full of the election, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; he told me to say he should be over here soon. Of course\nthere'll be no contest, so he need not trouble himself.\"\n\n\"Happy dog, isn't he, doctor? to have it all before him instead of\nbehind him. Well, well; he's as good a lad as ever lived,--as ever\nlived. And let me see; Mary's time--\" And then there were a few very\nimportant words spoken on that subject.\n\n\"I'll just step up to Lady Arabella now,\" said the doctor.\n\n\"She's as fretful as possible,\" said the squire. \"I've just left\nher.\"\n\n\"Nothing special the matter, I hope?\"\n\n\"No, I think not; nothing in your way, that is; only specially\ncross, which always comes in my way. You'll stop and dine to-day, of\ncourse?\"\n\n\"Not to-day, squire.\"\n\n\"Nonsense; you will. I have been quite counting on you. I have a\nparticular reason for wanting to have you to-day,--a most particular\nreason.\" But the squire always had his particular reasons.\n\n\"I'm very sorry, but it is impossible to-day. I shall have a letter\nto write that I must sit down to seriously. Shall I see you when I\ncome down from her ladyship?\"\n\nThe squire turned away sulkily, almost without answering him, for he\nnow had no prospect of any alleviation to the tedium of the evening;\nand the doctor went up-stairs to his patient.\n\nFor Lady Arabella, though it cannot be said that she was ill, was\nalways a patient. It must not be supposed that she kept her bed and\nswallowed daily doses, or was prevented from taking her share in such\nprosy gaieties as came from time to time in the way of her prosy\nlife; but it suited her turn of mind to be an invalid and to have a\ndoctor; and as the doctor whom her good fates had placed at her elbow\nthoroughly understood her case, no great harm was done.\n\n\"It frets me dreadfully that I cannot get to see Mary,\" Lady Arabella\nsaid, as soon as the first ordinary question as to her ailments had\nbeen asked and answered.\n\n\"She's quite well and will be over to see you before long.\"\n\n\"Now I beg that she won't. She never thinks of coming when there\ncan be no possible objection, and travelling, at the present moment,\nwould be--\" Whereupon the Lady Arabella shook her head very gravely.\n\"Only think of the importance of it, doctor,\" she said. \"Remember the\nenormous stake there is to be considered.\"\n\n\"It would not do her a ha'porth of harm if the stake were twice as\nlarge.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, doctor, don't tell me; as if I didn't know myself. I was\nvery much against her going to London this spring, but of course what\nI said was overruled. It always is. I do believe Mr. Gresham went\nover to Boxall Hill, on purpose to induce her to go. But what does he\ncare? He's fond of Frank; but he never thinks of looking beyond the\npresent day. He never did, as you know well enough, doctor.\"\n\n\"The trip did her all the good in the world,\" said Dr. Thorne,\npreferring anything to a conversation respecting the squire's sins.\n\n\"I very well remember that when I was in that way it wasn't thought\nthat such trips would do me any good. But, perhaps, things are\naltered since then.\"\n\n\"Yes, they are,\" said the doctor. \"We don't interfere so much\nnow-a-days.\"\n\n\"I know I never asked for such amusements when so much depended on\nquietness. I remember before Frank was born--and, indeed, when all of\nthem were born-- But as you say, things were different then; and I\ncan easily believe that Mary is a person quite determined to have her\nown way.\"\n\n\"Why, Lady Arabella, she would have stayed at home without wishing to\nstir if Frank had done so much as hold up his little finger.\"\n\n\"So did I always. If Mr. Gresham made the slightest hint I gave way.\nBut I really don't see what one gets in return for such implicit\nobedience. Now this year, doctor, of course I should have liked\nto have been up in London for a week or two. You seemed to think\nyourself that I might as well see Sir Omicron.\"\n\n\"There could be no possible objection, I said.\"\n\n\"Well; no; exactly; and as Mr. Gresham knew I wished it, I think he\nmight as well have offered it. I suppose there can be no reason now\nabout money.\"\n\n\"But I understood that Mary specially asked you and Augusta?\"\n\n\"Yes; Mary was very good. She did ask me. But I know very well that\nMary wants all the room she has got in London. The house is not at\nall too large for herself. And, for the matter of that, my sister,\nthe countess, was very anxious that I should be with her. But one\ndoes like to be independent if one can, and for one fortnight I do\nthink that Mr. Gresham might have managed it. When I knew that he was\nso dreadfully out at elbows I never troubled him about it,--though,\ngoodness knows, all that was never my fault.\"\n\n\"The squire hates London. A fortnight there in warm weather would\nnearly be the death of him.\"\n\n\"He might at any rate have paid me the compliment of asking me.\nThe chances are ten to one I should not have gone. It is that\nindifference that cuts me so. He was here just now, and, would you\nbelieve it?--\"\n\nBut the doctor was determined to avoid further complaint for the\npresent day. \"I wonder what you would feel, Lady Arabella, if the\nsquire were to take it into his head to go away and amuse himself,\nleaving you at home. There are worse men than Mr. Gresham, if you\nwill believe me.\" All this was an allusion to Earl de Courcy, her\nladyship's brother, as Lady Arabella very well understood; and the\nargument was one which was very often used to silence her.\n\n\"Upon my word, then, I should like it better than his hanging about\nhere doing nothing but attend to those nasty dogs. I really sometimes\nthink that he has no spirit left.\"\n\n\"You are mistaken there, Lady Arabella,\" said the doctor, rising with\nhis hat in his hand and making his escape without further parley.\n\nAs he went home he could not but think that that phase of married\nlife was not a very pleasant one. Mr. Gresham and his wife were\nsupposed by the world to live on the best of terms. They always\ninhabited the same house, went out together when they did go out,\nalways sat in their respective corners in the family pew, and in\ntheir wildest dreams after the happiness of novelty never thought of\nSir Cresswell Cresswell. In some respects--with regard, for instance,\nto the continued duration of their joint domesticity at the family\nmansion of Greshamsbury--they might have been taken for a pattern\ncouple. But yet, as far as the doctor could see, they did not seem\nto add much to the happiness of each other. They loved each other,\ndoubtless, and had either of them been in real danger, that danger\nwould have made the other miserable; but yet it might well be a\nquestion whether either would not be more comfortable without the\nother.\n\nThe doctor, as was his custom, dined at five, and at seven he went\nup to the cottage of his old friend Lady Scatcherd. Lady Scatcherd\nwas not a refined woman, having in her early days been a labourer's\ndaughter and having then married a labourer. But her husband had\nrisen in the world--as has been told in those chronicles before\nmentioned,--and his widow was now Lady Scatcherd with a pretty\ncottage and a good jointure. She was in all things the very opposite\nto Lady Arabella Gresham; nevertheless, under the doctor's auspices,\nthe two ladies were in some measure acquainted with each other. Of\nher married life, also, Dr. Thorne had seen something, and it may\nbe questioned whether the memory of that was more alluring than the\nreality now existing at Greshamsbury.\n\nOf the two women Dr. Thorne much preferred his humbler friend, and\nto her he made his visits not in the guise of a doctor, but as a\nneighbour. \"Well, my lady,\" he said, as he sat down by her on a broad\ngarden seat--all the world called Lady Scatcherd \"my lady,\"--\"and how\ndo these long summer days agree with you? Your roses are twice better\nout than any I see up at the big house.\"\n\n\"You may well call them long, doctor. They're long enough surely.\"\n\n\"But not too long. Come, now, I won't have you complaining. You don't\nmean to tell me that you have anything to make you wretched? You had\nbetter not, for I won't believe you.\"\n\n\"Eh; well; wretched! I don't know as I'm wretched. It'd be wicked to\nsay that, and I with such comforts about me.\"\n\n\"I think it would, almost.\" The doctor did not say this harshly, but\nin a soft, friendly tone, and pressing her hand gently as he spoke.\n\n\"And I didn't mean to be wicked. I'm very thankful for\neverything--leastways, I always try to be. But, doctor, it is so\nlonely like.\"\n\n\"Lonely! not more lonely than I am.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; you're different. You can go everywheres. But what can a\nlone woman do? I'll tell you what, doctor; I'd give it all up to have\nRoger back with his apron on and his pick in his hand. How well I\nmind his look when he'd come home o' nights.\"\n\n\"And yet it was a hard life you had then, eh, old woman? It would be\nbetter for you to be thankful for what you've got.\"\n\n\"I am thankful. Didn't I tell you so before?\" said she, somewhat\ncrossly. \"But it's a sad life, this living alone. I declares I envy\nHannah, 'cause she's got Jemima to sit in the kitchen with her. I\nwant her to sit with me sometimes, but she won't.\"\n\n\"Ah! but you shouldn't ask her. It's letting yourself down.\"\n\n\"What do I care about down or up? It makes no difference, as he's\ngone. If he had lived one might have cared about being up, as you\ncall it. Eh, deary; I'll be going after him before long, and it will\nbe no matter then.\"\n\n\"We shall all be going after him, sooner or later; that's sure\nenough.\"\n\n\"Eh, dear, that's true, surely. It's only a span long, as Parson\nOriel tells us when he gets romantic in his sermons. But it's a hard\nthing, doctor, when two is married, as they can't have their span,\nas he calls it, out together. Well, I must only put up with it, I\nsuppose, as others does. Now, you're not going, doctor? You'll stop\nand have a dish of tea with me. You never see such cream as Hannah\nhas from the Alderney cow. Do'ey now, doctor.\"\n\nBut the doctor had his letter to write, and would not allow himself\nto be tempted even by the promise of Hannah's cream. So he went\nhis way, angering Lady Scatcherd by his departure as he had\nbefore angered the squire, and thinking as he went which was most\nunreasonable in her wretchedness, his friend Lady Arabella, or his\nfriend Lady Scatcherd. The former was always complaining of an\nexisting husband who never refused her any moderate request; and the\nother passed her days in murmuring at the loss of a dead husband,\nwho in his life had ever been to her imperious and harsh, and had\nsometimes been cruel and unjust.\n\nThe doctor had his letter to write, but even yet he had not quite\nmade up his mind what he would put into it; indeed, he had not\nhitherto resolved to whom it should be written. Looking at the matter\nas he had endeavoured to look at it, his niece, Mrs. Gresham, would\nbe his correspondent; but if he brought himself to take this jump\nin the dark, in that case he would address himself direct to Miss\nDunstable.\n\nHe walked home, not by the straightest road, but taking a\nconsiderable curve, round by narrow lanes, and through thick\nflower-laden hedges,--very thoughtful. He was told that she wished to\nmarry him; and was he to think only of himself? And as to that pride\nof his about money, was it in truth a hearty, manly feeling; or was\nit a false pride, of which it behoved him to be ashamed as it did\nof many cognate feelings? If he acted rightly in this matter, why\nshould he be afraid of the thoughts of any one? A life of solitude\nwas bitter enough, as poor Lady Scatcherd had complained. But then,\nlooking at Lady Scatcherd, and looking also at his other near\nneighbour, his friend the squire, there was little thereabouts to\nlead him on to matrimony. So he walked home slowly through the lanes,\nvery meditative, with his hands behind his back.\n\nNor when he got home was he much more inclined to any resolute line\nof action. He might have drunk his tea with Lady Scatcherd, as well\nas have sat there in his own drawing-room, drinking it alone; for he\ngot no pen and paper, and he dawdled over his teacup with the utmost\ndilatoriness, putting off, as it were, the evil day. To only one\nthing was he fixed--to this, namely, that that letter should be\nwritten before he went to bed.\n\nHaving finished his tea, which did not take place till near eleven,\nhe went downstairs to an untidy little room which lay behind his\ndep\u00c3\u00b4t of medicines, and in which he was wont to do his writing;\nand herein he did at last set himself down to his work. Even at\nthat moment he was in doubt. But he would write his letter to Miss\nDunstable and see how it looked. He was almost determined not to send\nit; so, at least, he said to himself: but he could do no harm by\nwriting it. So he did write it, as follows:--\n\n\n   Greshamsbury, -- June, 185--.\n\n   MY DEAR MISS DUNSTABLE,--\n\n\nWhen he had got so far, he leaned back in his chair and looked at the\npaper. How on earth was he to find words to say that which he now\nwished to have said? He had never written such a letter in his life,\nor anything approaching to it, and now found himself overwhelmed with\na difficulty of which he had not previously thought. He spent another\nhalf-hour in looking at the paper, and was at last nearly deterred by\nthis new difficulty. He would use the simplest, plainest language, he\nsaid to himself over and over again; but it is not always easy to use\nsimple, plain language,--by no means so easy as to mount on stilts,\nand to march along with sesquipedalian words, with pathos, spasms,\nand notes of interjection. But the letter did at last get itself\nwritten, and there was not a note of interjection in it.\n\n\n   MY DEAR MISS DUNSTABLE,--I think it right to confess that\n   I should not be now writing this letter to you, had I not\n   been led to believe by other judgment than my own that the\n   proposition which I am going to make would be regarded\n   by you with favour. Without such other judgment I should,\n   I own, have feared that the great disparity between you\n   and me in regard to money would have given to such a\n   proposition an appearance of being false and mercenary.\n   All I ask of you now, with confidence, is to acquit me of\n   such fault as that.\n\n   When you have read so far you will understand what I mean.\n   We have known each other now somewhat intimately, though\n   indeed not very long, and I have sometimes fancied that\n   you were almost as well pleased to be with me as I have\n   been to be with you. If I have been wrong in this, tell me\n   so simply, and I will endeavour to let our friendship run\n   on as though this letter had not been written. But if I\n   have been right, and if it be possible that you can think\n   that a union between us will make us both happier than we\n   are single, I will plight you my word and troth with good\n   faith, and will do what an old man may do to make the\n   burden of the world lie light upon your shoulders. Looking\n   at my age I can hardly keep myself from thinking that I\n   am an old fool: but I try to reconcile myself to that by\n   remembering that you yourself are no longer a girl. You\n   see that I pay you no compliments, and that you need\n   expect none from me.\n\n   I do not know that I could add anything to the truth of\n   this, if I were to write three times as much. All that is\n   necessary is, that you should know what I mean. If you do\n   not believe me to be true and honest already, nothing that\n   I can write will make you believe it.\n\n   God bless you. I know you will not keep me long in\n   suspense for an answer.\n\n   Affectionately your friend,\n\n   THOMAS THORNE.\n\n\nWhen he had finished he meditated again for another half-hour whether\nit would not be right that he should add something about her money.\nWould it not be well for him to tell her--it might be said in a\npostscript--that with regard to all her wealth she would be free to\ndo what she chose? At any rate he owed no debts for her to pay, and\nwould still have his own income, sufficient for his own purposes. But\nabout one o'clock he came to the conclusion that it would be better\nto leave the matter alone. If she cared for him, and could trust him,\nand was worthy also that he should trust her, no omission of such a\nstatement would deter her from coming to him: and if there were no\nsuch trust, it would not be created by any such assurance on his\npart. So he read the letter over twice, sealed it, and took it up,\ntogether with his bed candle, into his bed-room. Now that the letter\nwas written it seemed to be a thing fixed by fate that it must go.\nHe had written it that he might see how it looked when written; but\nnow that it was written, there remained no doubt but that it must be\nsent. So he went to bed, with the letter on the toilette-table beside\nhim; and early in the morning--so early as to make it seem that the\nimportance of the letter had disturbed his rest--he sent it off by a\nspecial messenger to Boxall Hill.\n\n\"I'se wait for an answer?\" said the boy.\n\n\"No,\" said the doctor: \"leave the letter, and come away.\"\n\nThe breakfast hour was not very early at Boxall Hill in these summer\nmonths. Frank Gresham, no doubt, went round his farm before he came\nin for prayers, and his wife was probably looking to the butter\nin the dairy. At any rate, they did not meet till near ten, and\ntherefore, though the ride from Greshamsbury to Boxall Hill was\nnearly two hours' work, Miss Dunstable had her letter in her own room\nbefore she came down.\n\nShe read it in silence as she was dressing, while the maid was with\nher in the room; but she made no sign which could induce her Abigail\nto think that the epistle was more than ordinarily important.\nShe read it, and then quietly refolding it and placing it in the\nenvelope, she put it down on the table at which she was sitting.\nIt was full fifteen minutes afterwards that she begged her servant\nto see if Mrs. Gresham were still in her own room. \"Because I want\nto see her for five minutes, alone, before breakfast,\" said Miss\nDunstable.\n\n\"You traitor; you false, black traitor!\" were the first words which\nMiss Dunstable spoke when she found herself alone with her friend.\n\n\"Why, what's the matter?\"\n\n\"I did not think there was so much mischief in you, nor so keen and\ncommonplace a desire for match-making. Look here. Read the first four\nlines; not more, if you please; the rest is private. Whose is the\nother judgment of whom your uncle speaks in his letter?\"\n\n\"Oh, Miss Dunstable! I must read it all.\"\n\n\"Indeed you'll do no such thing. You think it's a love-letter, I dare\nsay; but indeed there's not a word about love in it.\"\n\n\"I know he has offered. I shall be so glad, for I know you like him.\"\n\n\"He tells me that I am an old woman, and insinuates that I may\nprobably be an old fool.\"\n\n\"I am sure he does not say that.\"\n\n\"Ah! but I'm sure that he does. The former is true enough, and I\nnever complain of the truth. But as to the latter, I am by no means\nso certain that it is true--not in the sense that he means it.\"\n\n\"Dear, dearest woman, don't go on in that way now. Do speak out to\nme, and speak without jesting.\"\n\n\"Whose was the other judgment to whom he trusts so implicitly? Tell\nme that.\"\n\n\"Mine, mine, of course. No one else can have spoken to him about it.\nOf course I talked to him.\"\n\n\"And what did you tell him?\"\n\n\"I told him--\"\n\n\"Well, out with it. Let me have the real facts. Mind, I tell you\nfairly that you had no right to tell him anything. What passed\nbetween us, passed in confidence. But let us hear what you did say.\"\n\n\"I told him that you would have him if he offered.\" And Mrs. Gresham,\nas she spoke, looked into her friend's face doubtingly, not knowing\nwhether in very truth Miss Dunstable were pleased with her or\ndispleased. If she were displeased, then how had her uncle been\ndeceived!\n\n\"You told him that as a fact?\"\n\n\"I told him that I thought so.\"\n\n\"Then I suppose I am bound to have him,\" said Miss Dunstable,\ndropping the letter on to the floor in mock despair.\n\n\"My dear, dear, dearest woman!\" said Mrs. Gresham, bursting into\ntears, and throwing herself on to her friend's neck.\n\n\"Mind you are a dutiful niece,\" said Miss Dunstable. \"And now let me\ngo and finish dressing.\"\n\nIn the course of the afternoon, an answer was sent back to\nGreshamsbury, in these words:--\n\n\n   DEAR DR. THORNE,--I do and will trust you in everything;\n   and it shall be as you would have it. Mary writes to you;\n   but do not believe a word she says. I never will again,\n   for she has behaved so bad in this matter.\n\n   Yours affectionately and very truly,\n\n   MARTHA DUNSTABLE.\n\n\n\"And so I am going to marry the richest woman in England,\" said Dr.\nThorne to himself, as he sat down that day to his mutton-chop.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL.\n\nINTERNECINE.\n\n\nIt must be conceived that there was some feeling of triumph at\nPlumstead Episcopi, when the wife of the rector returned home with\nher daughter, the bride elect of the Lord Dumbello. The heir of the\nMarquis of Hartletop was, in wealth, the most considerable unmarried\nyoung nobleman of the day; he was noted, too, as a man difficult to\nbe pleased, as one who was very fine and who gave himself airs,--and\nto have been selected as the wife of such a man as this was a great\nthing for the daughter of a parish clergyman. We have seen in what\nmanner the happy girl's mother communicated the fact to Lady Lufton,\nhiding, as it were, her pride under a veil; and we have seen also how\nmeekly the happy girl bore her own great fortune, applying herself\nhumbly to the packing of her clothes, as though she ignored her own\nglory.\n\nBut nevertheless there was triumph at Plumstead Episcopi. The mother,\nwhen she returned home, began to feel that she had been thoroughly\nsuccessful in the great object of her life. While she was yet in\nLondon she had hardly realized her satisfaction, and there were\ndoubts then whether the cup might not be dashed from her lips before\nit was tasted. It might be that even the son of the Marquis of\nHartletop was subject to parental authority, and that barriers should\nspring up between Griselda and her coronet; but there had been\nnothing of the kind. The archdeacon had been closeted with the\nmarquis, and Mrs. Grantly had been closeted with the marchioness;\nand though neither of those noble persons had expressed themselves\ngratified by their son's proposed marriage, so also neither of them\nhad made any attempt to prevent it. Lord Dumbello was a man who had\na will of his own,--as the Grantlys boasted amongst themselves. Poor\nGriselda! the day may perhaps come when this fact of her lord's\nmasterful will may not to her be matter of much boasting. But in\nLondon, as I was saying, there had been no time for an appreciation\nof the family joy. The work to be done was nervous in its nature,\nand self-glorification might have been fatal; but now, when they\nwere safe at Plumstead, the great truth burst upon them in all its\nsplendour.\n\nMrs. Grantly had but one daughter, and the formation of that child's\ncharacter and her establishment in the world had been the one main\nobject of the mother's life. Of Griselda's great beauty the Plumstead\nhousehold had long been conscious; of her discretion also, of her\nconduct, and of her demeanour there had been no doubt. But the father\nhad sometimes hinted to the mother that he did not think that Grizzy\nwas quite so clever as her brothers. \"I don't agree with you at all,\"\nMrs. Grantly had answered. \"Besides, what you call cleverness is not\nat all necessary in a girl; she is perfectly ladylike; even you won't\ndeny that.\" The archdeacon had never wished to deny it, and was now\nfain to admit that what he had called cleverness was not necessary in\na young lady.\n\nAt this period of the family glory the archdeacon himself was kept a\nlittle in abeyance, and was hardly allowed free intercourse with his\nown magnificent child. Indeed, to give him his due, it must be said\nof him that he would not consent to walk in the triumphal procession\nwhich moved with stately step, to and fro, through the Barchester\nregions. He kissed his daughter and blessed her, and bade her love\nher husband and be a good wife; but such injunctions as these,\nseeing how splendidly she had done her duty in securing to herself a\nmarquis, seemed out of place and almost vulgar. Girls about to marry\ncurates or sucking barristers should be told to do their duty in that\nstation of life to which God might be calling them; but it seemed to\nbe almost an impertinence in a father to give such an injunction to a\nfuture marchioness.\n\n\"I do not think that you have any ground for fear on her behalf,\"\nsaid Mrs. Grantly, \"seeing in what way she has hitherto conducted\nherself.\"\n\n\"She has been a good girl,\" said the archdeacon, \"but she is about to\nbe placed in a position of great temptation.\"\n\n\"She has a strength of mind suited for any position,\" replied Mrs.\nGrantly, vain-gloriously.\n\nBut nevertheless even the archdeacon moved about through the close\nat Barchester with a somewhat prouder step since the tidings of this\nalliance had become known there. The time had been--in the latter\ndays of his father's lifetime--when he was the greatest man of the\nclose. The dean had been old and infirm, and Dr. Grantly had wielded\nthe bishop's authority. But since that things had altered. A new\nbishop had come there, absolutely hostile to him. A new dean had\nalso come, who was not only his friend, but the brother-in-law of\nhis wife; but even this advent had lessened the authority of the\narchdeacon. The vicars choral did not hang upon his words as they\nhad been wont to do, and the minor canons smiled in return to\nhis smile less obsequiously when they met him in the clerical\ncircles of Barchester. But now it seemed that his old supremacy was\nrestored to him. In the minds of many men an archdeacon, who was the\nfather-in-law of a marquis, was himself as good as any bishop. He did\nnot say much of his new connection to others beside the dean, but he\nwas conscious of the fact, and conscious also of the reflected glory\nwhich shone around his own head.\n\nBut as regards Mrs. Grantly it may be said that she moved in an\nunending procession of stately ovation. It must not be supposed that\nshe continually talked to her friends and neighbours of Lord Dumbello\nand the marchioness. She was by far too wise for such folly as that.\nThe coming alliance having been once announced, the name of Hartletop\nwas hardly mentioned by her out of her own domestic circle. But she\nassumed, with an ease that was surprising even to herself, the airs\nand graces of a mighty woman. She went through her work of morning\ncalls as though it were her business to be affable to the country\ngentry. She astonished her sister, the dean's wife, by the simplicity\nof her grandeur; and condescended to Mrs. Proudie in a manner which\nnearly broke that lady's heart. \"I shall be even with her yet,\" said\nMrs. Proudie to herself, who had contrived to learn various very\ndeleterious circumstances respecting the Hartletop family since the\nnews about Lord Dumbello and Griselda had become known to her.\n\nGriselda herself was carried about in the procession, taking but\nlittle part in it of her own, like an Eastern god. She suffered her\nmother's caresses and smiled in her mother's face as she listened to\nher own praises, but her triumph was apparently within. To no one did\nshe say much on the subject, and greatly disgusted the old family\nhousekeeper by declining altogether to discuss the future Dumbello\n_m\u00c3\u00a9nage_. To her aunt, Mrs. Arabin, who strove hard to lead her\ninto some open-hearted speech as to her future aspirations, she was\nperfectly impassive. \"Oh, yes, aunt, of course,\" and \"I'll think\nabout it, aunt Eleanor,\" or \"Of course I shall do that if Lord\nDumbello wishes it.\" Nothing beyond this could be got from her; and\nso, after half-a-dozen ineffectual attempts, Mrs. Arabin abandoned\nthe matter.\n\nBut then there arose the subject of clothes--of the wedding\n_trousseau_! Sarcastic people are wont to say that the tailor makes\nthe man. Were I such a one, I might certainly assert that the\nmilliner makes the bride. As regarding her bridehood, in distinction\neither to her girlhood or her wifehood--as being a line of plain\ndemarcation between those two periods of a woman's life--the milliner\ndoes do much to make her. She would be hardly a bride if the\n_trousseau_ were not there. A girl married without some such\nappendage would seem to pass into the condition of a wife without any\nsuch line of demarcation. In that moment in which she finds herself\nin the first fruition of her marriage finery she becomes a bride; and\nin that other moment, when she begins to act upon the finest of these\nthings as clothes to be packed up, she becomes a wife.\n\nWhen this subject was discussed Griselda displayed no lack of a\nbecoming interest. She went to work steadily, slowly, and almost with\nsolemnity, as though the business in hand were one which it would be\nwicked to treat with impatience. She even struck her mother with awe\nby the grandeur of her ideas and the depth of her theories. Nor let\nit be supposed that she rushed away at once to the consideration of\nthe great fabric which was to be the ultimate sign and mark of her\nstatus, the quintessence of her briding, the outer veil, as it were,\nof the tabernacle--namely, her wedding-dress. As a great poet works\nhimself up by degrees to that inspiration which is necessary for\nthe grand turning point of his epic, so did she slowly approach the\nhallowed ground on which she would sit, with her ministers around\nher, when about to discuss the nature, the extent, the design, the\ncolouring, the structure, and the ornamentation of that momentous\npiece of apparel. No; there was much indeed to be done before she\ncame to this; and as the poet, to whom I have already alluded, first\ninvokes his muse, and then brings his smaller events gradually out\nupon his stage, so did Miss Grantly with sacred fervour ask her\nmother's aid, and then prepare her list of all those articles\nof under-clothing which must be the substratum for the visible\nmagnificence of her _trousseau_.\n\nMoney was no object. We all know what that means; and frequently\nunderstand, when the words are used, that a blaze of splendour is to\nbe attained at the cheapest possible price. But, in this instance,\nmoney was no object;--such an amount of money, at least, as could by\nany possibility be spent on a lady's clothes, independently of her\njewels. With reference to diamonds and such like, the archdeacon\nat once declared his intention of taking the matter into his own\nhands--except in so far as Lord Dumbello, or the Hartletop interest,\nmight be pleased to participate in the selection. Nor was Mrs.\nGrantly sorry for such a decision. She was not an imprudent woman,\nand would have dreaded the responsibility of trusting herself on\nsuch an occasion among the dangerous temptations of a jeweller's\nshop. But as far as silks and satins went--in the matter of\nFrench bonnets, muslins, velvets, hats, riding-habits, artificial\nflowers, head-gilding, curious nettings, enamelled buckles, golden\ntagged bobbins, and mechanical petticoats--as regarded shoes, and\ngloves, and corsets, and stockings, and linen, and flannel, and\ncalico--money, I may conscientiously assert, was no object. And,\nunder these circumstances, Griselda Grantly went to work with a\nsolemn industry and a steady perseverance that was beyond all praise.\n\n\"I hope she will be happy,\" Mrs. Arabin said to her sister, as the\ntwo were sitting together in the dean's drawing-room.\n\n\"Oh, yes; I think she will. Why should she not?\" said the mother.\n\n\"Oh, no; I know of no reason. But she is going up into a station so\nmuch above her own in the eyes of the world that one cannot but feel\nanxious for her.\"\n\n\"I should feel much more anxious if she were going to marry a poor\nman,\" said Mrs. Grantly. \"It has always seemed to me that Griselda\nwas fitted for a high position; that nature intended her for rank and\nstate. You see that she is not a bit elated. She takes it all as if\nit were her own by right. I do not think that there is any danger\nthat her head will be turned, if you mean that.\"\n\n\"I was thinking rather of her heart,\" said Mrs. Arabin.\n\n\"She never would have taken Lord Dumbello without loving him,\" said\nMrs. Grantly, speaking rather quickly.\n\n\"That is not quite what I mean either, Susan. I am sure she would not\nhave accepted him had she not loved him. But it is so hard to keep\nthe heart fresh among all the grandeurs of high rank; and it is\nharder for a girl to do so who has not been born to it, than for one\nwho has enjoyed it as her birthright.\"\n\n\"I don't quite understand about fresh hearts,\" said Mrs. Grantly,\npettishly. \"If she does her duty, and loves her husband, and fills\nthe position in which God has placed her with propriety, I don't know\nthat we need look for anything more. I don't at all approve of the\nplan of frightening a young girl when she is making her first outset\ninto the world.\"\n\n\"No; I would not frighten her. I think it would be almost difficult\nto frighten Griselda.\"\n\n\"I hope it would. The great matter with a girl is whether she has\nbeen brought up with proper notions as to a woman's duty. Of course\nit is not for me to boast on this subject. Such as she is, I, of\ncourse, am responsible. But I must own that I do not see occasion to\nwish for any change.\" And then the subject was allowed to drop.\n\nAmong those of her relations who wondered much at the girl's fortune,\nbut allowed themselves to say but little, was her grandfather, Mr.\nHarding. He was an old clergyman, plain and simple in his manners,\nand not occupying a very prominent position, seeing that he was only\nprecentor to the chapter. He was loved by his daughter, Mrs. Grantly,\nand was treated by the archdeacon, if not invariably with the highest\nrespect, at least always with consideration and regard. But, old\nand plain as he was, the young people at Plumstead did not hold him\nin any great reverence. He was poorer than their other relatives,\nand made no attempt to hold his head high in Barsetshire circles.\nMoreover, in these latter days, the home of his heart had been at the\ndeanery. He had, indeed, a lodging of his own in the city, but was\ngradually allowing himself to be weaned away from it. He had his own\nbedroom in the dean's house, his own arm-chair in the dean's library,\nand his own corner on a sofa in Mrs. Dean's drawing-room. It was\nnot, therefore, necessary that he should interfere greatly in this\ncoming marriage; but still it became his duty to say a word of\ncongratulation to his granddaughter,--and perhaps to say a word of\nadvice.\n\n\"Grizzy, my dear,\" he said to her--he always called her Grizzy, but\nthe endearment of the appellation had never been appreciated by the\nyoung lady--\"come and kiss me, and let me congratulate you on your\ngreat promotion. I do so very heartily.\"\n\n\"Thank you, grandpapa,\" she said, touching his forehead with her\nlips, thus being, as it were, very sparing with her kiss. But those\nlips now were august and reserved for nobler foreheads than that of\nan old cathedral hack. For Mr. Harding still chanted the Litany from\nSunday to Sunday, unceasingly, standing at that well-known desk in\nthe cathedral choir; and Griselda had a thought in her mind that\nwhen the Hartletop people should hear of the practice they would not\nbe delighted. Dean and archdeacon might be very well, and if her\ngrandfather had even been a prebendary, she might have put up with\nhim; but he had, she thought, almost disgraced his family in being,\nat his age, one of the working menial clergy of the cathedral. She\nkissed him, therefore, sparingly, and resolved that her words with\nhim should be few.\n\n\"You are going to be a great lady, Grizzy,\" said he.\n\n\"Umph!\" said she.\n\nWhat was she to say when so addressed?\n\n\"And I hope you will be happy,--and make others happy.\"\n\n\"I hope I shall,\" said she.\n\n\"But always think most about the latter, my dear. Think about the\nhappiness of those around you, and your own will come without\nthinking. You understand that; do you not?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I understand,\" she said.\n\nAs they were speaking Mr. Harding still held her hand, but Griselda\nleft it with him unwillingly, and therefore ungraciously, looking as\nthough she were dragging it from him.\n\n\"And Grizzy--I believe it is quite as easy for a rich countess to be\nhappy, as for a dairymaid--\"\n\nGriselda gave her head a little chuck which was produced by two\ndifferent operations of her mind. The first was a reflection that\nher grandpapa was robbing her of her rank. She was to be a rich\nmarchioness. And the second was a feeling of anger at the old man for\ncomparing her lot to that of a dairymaid.\n\n\"Quite as easy, I believe,\" continued he; \"though others will tell\nyou that it is not so. But with the countess as with the dairymaid,\nit must depend on the woman herself. Being a countess--that fact\nalone won't make you happy.\"\n\n\"Lord Dumbello at present is only a viscount,\" said Griselda. \"There\nis no earl's title in the family.\"\n\n\"Oh! I did not know,\" said Mr. Harding, relinquishing his\ngranddaughter's hand; and, after that, he troubled her with no\nfurther advice.\n\nBoth Mrs. Proudie and the bishop had called at Plumstead since Mrs.\nGrantly had come back from London, and the ladies from Plumstead,\nof course, returned the visit. It was natural that the Grantlys and\nProudies should hate each other. They were essentially church people,\nand their views on all church matters were antagonistic. They had\nbeen compelled to fight for supremacy in the diocese, and neither\nfamily had so conquered the other as to have become capable of\nmagnanimity and good-humour. They did hate each other, and this\nhatred had, at one time, almost produced an absolute disseverance of\neven the courtesies which are so necessary between a bishop and his\nclergy. But the bitterness of this rancour had been overcome, and the\nladies of the families had continued on visiting terms.\n\nBut now this match was almost more than Mrs. Proudie could bear.\nThe great disappointment which, as she well knew, the Grantlys had\nencountered in that matter of the proposed new bishopric had for\nthe moment mollified her. She had been able to talk of poor dear\nMrs. Grantly! \"She is heartbroken, you know, in this matter, and the\nrepetition of such misfortunes is hard to bear,\" she had been heard\nto say, with a complacency which had been quite becoming to her. But\nnow that complacency was at an end. Olivia Proudie had just accepted\na widowed preacher at a district church in Bethnal Green,--a man with\nthree children, who was dependent on pew-rents; and Griselda Grantly\nwas engaged to the eldest son of the Marquis of Hartletop! When women\nare enjoined to forgive their enemies it cannot be intended that such\nwrongs as these should be included.\n\nBut Mrs. Proudie's courage was nothing daunted. It may be boasted of\nher that nothing could daunt her courage. Soon after her return to\nBarchester, she and Olivia--Olivia being very unwilling--had driven\nover to Plumstead, and, not finding the Grantlys at home, had left\ntheir cards; and now, at a proper interval, Mrs. Grantly and Griselda\nreturned the visit. It was the first time that Miss Grantly had been\nseen by the Proudie ladies since the fact of her engagement had\nbecome known.\n\nThe first bevy of compliments that passed might be likened to a crowd\nof flowers on a hedge rosebush. They were beautiful to the eye but\nwere so closely environed by thorns that they could not be plucked\nwithout great danger. As long as the compliments were allowed to\nremain on the hedge--while no attempt was made to garner them and\nrealize their fruits for enjoyment--they did no mischief; but the\nfirst finger that was put forth for such a purpose was soon drawn\nback, marked with spots of blood.\n\n\"Of course it is a great match for Griselda,\" said Mrs. Grantly, in\na whisper the meekness of which would have disarmed an enemy whose\nweapons were less firmly clutched than those of Mrs. Proudie; \"but,\nindependently of that, the connection is one which is gratifying in\nmany ways.\"\n\n\"Oh, no doubt,\" said Mrs. Proudie.\n\n\"Lord Dumbello is so completely his own master,\" continued Mrs.\nGrantly, and a slight, unintended semi-tone of triumph mingled itself\nwith the meekness of that whisper.\n\n\"And is likely to remain so, from all I hear,\" said Mrs. Proudie, and\nthe scratched hand was at once drawn back.\n\n\"Of course the estab--,\" and then Mrs. Proudie, who was blandly\ncontinuing her list of congratulations, whispered her sentence close\ninto the ear of Mrs. Grantly, so that not a word of what she said\nmight be audible by the young people.\n\n\"I never heard a word of it,\" said Mrs. Grantly, gathering herself\nup, \"and I don't believe it.\"\n\n\"Oh, I may be wrong; and I'm sure I hope so. But young men will be\nyoung men, you know;--and children will take after their parents. I\nsuppose you will see a great deal of the Duke of Omnium now.\"\n\nBut Mrs. Grantly was not a woman to be knocked down and trampled on\nwithout resistance; and though she had been lacerated by the rosebush\nshe was not as yet placed altogether _hors de combat_. She said some\nword about the Duke of Omnium very tranquilly, speaking of him merely\nas a Barsetshire proprietor, and then, smiling with her sweetest\nsmile, expressed a hope that she might soon have the pleasure of\nbecoming acquainted with Mr. Tickler; and as she spoke she made a\npretty little bow towards Olivia Proudie. Now Mr. Tickler was the\nworthy clergyman attached to the district church at Bethnal Green.\n\n\"He'll be down here in August,\" said Olivia, boldly, determined not\nto be shamefaced about her love affairs.\n\n\"You'll be starring it about the Continent by that time, my dear,\"\nsaid Mrs. Proudie to Griselda. \"Lord Dumbello is well known at\nHomburg and Ems, and places of that sort; so you will find yourself\nquite at home.\"\n\n\"We are going to Rome,\" said Griselda, majestically.\n\n\"I suppose Mr. Tickler will come into the diocese soon,\" said Mrs.\nGrantly. \"I remember hearing him very favourably spoken of by Mr.\nSlope, who was a friend of his.\"\n\nNothing short of a fixed resolve on the part of Mrs. Grantly that the\ntime had now come in which she must throw away her shield and stand\nbehind her sword, declare war to the knife, and neither give nor take\nquarter, could have justified such a speech as this. Any allusion to\nMr. Slope acted on Mrs. Proudie as a red cloth is supposed to act on\na bull; but when that allusion connected the name of Mr. Slope in\na friendly bracket with that of Mrs. Proudie's future son-in-law\nit might be certain that the effect would be terrific. And there\nwas more than this: for that very Mr. Slope had once entertained\naudacious hopes--hopes not thought to be audacious by the young lady\nherself--with reference to Miss Olivia Proudie. All this Mrs. Grantly\nknew, and, knowing it, still dared to mention his name.\n\nThe countenance of Mrs. Proudie became darkened with black anger,\nand the polished smile of her company manners gave place before the\noutraged feelings of her nature.\n\n\"The man you speak of, Mrs. Grantly,\" said she, \"was never known as a\nfriend by Mr. Tickler.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed,\" said Mrs. Grantly. \"Perhaps I have made a mistake. I am\nsure I have heard Mr. Slope mention him.\"\n\n\"When Mr. Slope was running after your sister, Mrs. Grantly, and was\nencouraged by her as he was, you perhaps saw more of him than I did.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Proudie, that was never the case.\"\n\n\"I have reason to know that the archdeacon conceived it to be so, and\nthat he was very unhappy about it.\" Now this, unfortunately, was a\nfact which Mrs. Grantly could not deny.\n\n\"The archdeacon may have been mistaken about Mr. Slope,\" she said,\n\"as were some other people at Barchester. But it was you, I think,\nMrs. Proudie, who were responsible for bringing him here.\"\n\nMrs. Grantly, at this period of the engagement, might have inflicted\na fatal wound by referring to poor Olivia's former love affairs, but\nshe was not destitute of generosity. Even in the extremest heat of\nthe battle she knew how to spare the young and tender.\n\n\"When I came here, Mrs. Grantly, I little dreamed what a depth of\nwickedness might be found in the very close of a cathedral city,\"\nsaid Mrs. Proudie.\n\n\"Then, for dear Olivia's sake, pray do not bring poor Mr. Tickler to\nBarchester.\"\n\n\"Mr. Tickler, Mrs. Grantly, is a man of assured morals and of a\nhighly religious tone of thinking. I wish every one could be so safe\nas regards their daughters' future prospects as I am.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know he has the advantage of being a family man,\" said Mrs.\nGrantly, getting up. \"Good morning, Mrs. Proudie; good day, Olivia.\"\n\n\"A great deal better that than--\" But the blow fell upon the empty\nair; for Mrs. Grantly had already escaped on to the staircase while\nOlivia was ringing the bell for the servant to attend the front-door.\n\nMrs. Grantly, as she got into her carriage, smiled slightly, thinking\nof the battle, and as she sat down she gently pressed her daughter's\nhand. But Mrs. Proudie's face was still dark as Acheron when her\nenemy withdrew, and with angry tone she sent her daughter to her\nwork. \"Mr. Tickler will have great reason to complain if, in your\nposition, you indulge such habits of idleness,\" she said. Therefore\nI conceive that I am justified in saying that in that encounter Mrs.\nGrantly was the conqueror.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI.\n\nDON QUIXOTE.\n\n\nOn the day on which Lucy had her interview with Lady Lufton the dean\ndined at Framley Parsonage. He and Robarts had known each other\nsince the latter had been in the diocese, and now, owing to Mark's\npreferment in the chapter, had become almost intimate. The dean was\ngreatly pleased with the manner in which poor Mr. Crawley's children\nhad been conveyed away from Hogglestock, and was inclined to open his\nheart to the whole Framley household. As he still had to ride home\nhe could only allow himself to remain half an hour after dinner, but\nin that half-hour he said a great deal about Crawley, complimented\nRobarts on the manner in which he was playing the part of the Good\nSamaritan, and then by degrees informed him that it had come to his,\nthe dean's, ears, before he left Barchester, that a writ was in the\nhands of certain persons in the city, enabling them to seize--he did\nnot know whether it was the person or the property of the vicar of\nFramley.\n\nThe fact was that these tidings had been conveyed to the dean with\nthe express intent that he might put Robarts on his guard; but the\ntask of speaking on such a subject to a brother clergyman had been so\nunpleasant to him that he had been unable to introduce it till the\nlast five minutes before his departure.\n\n\"I hope you will not put it down as an impertinent interference,\"\nsaid the dean, apologizing.\n\n\"No,\" said Mark; \"no, I do not think that.\" He was so sad at heart\nthat he hardly knew how to speak of it.\n\n\"I do not understand much about such matters,\" said the dean; \"but I\nthink, if I were you, I should go to a lawyer. I should imagine that\nanything so terribly disagreeable as an arrest might be avoided.\"\n\n\"It is a hard case,\" said Mark, pleading his own cause. \"Though these\nmen have this claim against me I have never received a shilling\neither in money or money's worth.\"\n\n\"And yet your name is to the bills!\" said the dean.\n\n\"Yes, my name is to the bills, certainly, but it was to oblige a\nfriend.\"\n\nAnd then the dean, having given his advice, rode away. He could not\nunderstand how a clergyman, situated as was Mr. Robarts, could find\nhimself called upon by friendship to attach his name to accommodation\nbills which he had not the power of liquidating when due!\n\nOn that evening they were both wretched enough at the parsonage.\nHitherto Mark had hoped that perhaps, after all, no absolutely\nhostile steps would be taken against him with reference to these\nbills. Some unforeseen chance might occur in his favour, or the\npersons holding them might consent to take small instalments of\npayment from time to time; but now it seemed that the evil day was\nactually coming upon him at a blow. He had no longer any secrets from\nhis wife. Should he go to a lawyer? and if so, to what lawyer? And\nwhen he had found his lawyer, what should he say to him? Mrs. Robarts\nat one time suggested that everything should be told to Lady Lufton.\nMark, however, could not bring himself to do that. \"It would seem,\"\nhe said, \"as though I wanted her to lend me the money.\"\n\nOn the following morning Mark did ride into Barchester, dreading,\nhowever, lest he should be arrested on his journey, and he did see a\nlawyer. During his absence two calls were made at the parsonage--one\nby a very rough-looking individual, who left a suspicious document\nin the hands of the servant, purporting to be an invitation--not to\ndinner--from one of the judges of the land; and the other call was\nmade by Lady Lufton in person.\n\nMrs. Robarts had determined to go down to Framley Court on that day.\nIn accordance with her usual custom she would have been there within\nan hour or two of Lady Lufton's return from London, but things\nbetween them were not now as they usually had been. This affair of\nLucy's must make a difference, let them both resolve to the contrary\nas they might. And, indeed, Mrs. Robarts had found that the closeness\nof her intimacy with Framley Court had been diminishing from day to\nday since Lucy had first begun to be on friendly terms with Lord\nLufton. Since that she had been less at Framley Court than usual;\nshe had heard from Lady Lufton less frequently by letter during her\nabsence than she had done in former years, and was aware that she was\nless implicitly trusted with all the affairs of the parish. This had\nnot made her angry, for she was in a manner conscious that it must be\nso. It made her unhappy, but what could she do? She could not blame\nLucy, nor could she blame Lady Lufton. Lord Lufton she did blame, but\nshe did so in the hearing of no one but her husband.\n\nHer mind, however, was made up to go over and bear the first brunt\nof her ladyship's arguments, when she was stopped by her ladyship's\narrival. If it were not for this terrible matter of Lucy's love--a\nmatter on which they could not now be silent when they met--there\nwould be twenty subjects of pleasant, or, at any rate, not unpleasant\nconversation. But even then there would be those terrible bills\nhanging over her conscience, and almost crushing her by their weight.\nAt the moment in which Lady Lufton walked up to the drawing-room\nwindow, Mrs. Robarts held in her hand that ominous invitation from\nthe judge. Would it not be well that she should make a clean breast\nof it all, disregarding what her husband had said? It might be well:\nonly this--she had never yet done anything in opposition to her\nhusband's wishes. So she hid the slip within her desk, and left the\nmatter open to consideration.\n\nThe interview commenced with an affectionate embrace, as was a matter\nof course. \"Dear Fanny,\" and \"Dear Lady Lufton,\" was said between\nthem with all the usual warmth. And then the first inquiry was made\nabout the children, and the second about the school. For a minute or\ntwo Mrs. Robarts thought that, perhaps, nothing was to be said about\nLucy. If it pleased Lady Lufton to be silent she, at least, would not\ncommence the subject.\n\nThen there was a word or two spoken about Mrs. Podgens' baby, after\nwhich Lady Lufton asked whether Fanny were alone.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mrs. Robarts. \"Mark has gone over to Barchester.\"\n\n\"I hope he will not be long before he lets me see him. Perhaps he can\ncall to-morrow. Would you both come and dine to-morrow?\"\n\n\"Not to-morrow, I think, Lady Lufton; but Mark, I am sure, will go\nover and call.\"\n\n\"And why not come to dinner? I hope there is to be no change among\nus, eh, Fanny?\" and Lady Lufton as she spoke looked into the other's\nface in a manner which almost made Mrs. Robarts get up and throw\nherself on her old friend's neck. Where was she to find a friend\nwho would give her such constant love as she had received from Lady\nLufton? And who was kinder, better, more honest than she?\n\n\"Change! no, I hope not, Lady Lufton;\" and as she spoke the tears\nstood in her eyes.\n\n\"Ah, but I shall think there is if you will not come to me as you\nused to do. You always used to come and dine with me the day I came\nhome, as a matter of course.\"\n\nWhat could she say, poor woman, to this?\n\n\"We were all in confusion yesterday about poor Mrs. Crawley, and the\ndean dined here; he had been over at Hogglestock to see his friend.\"\n\n\"I have heard of her illness, and will go over and see what ought\nto be done. Don't you go, do you hear, Fanny? You with your young\nchildren! I should never forgive you if you did.\"\n\nAnd then Mrs. Robarts explained how Lucy had gone there, had sent\nthe four children back to Framley, and was herself now staying at\nHogglestock with the object of nursing Mrs. Crawley. In telling the\nstory she abstained from praising Lucy with all the strong language\nwhich she would have used had not Lucy's name and character been\nat the present moment of peculiar import to Lady Lufton; but\nnevertheless she could not tell it without dwelling much on Lucy's\nkindness. It would have been ungenerous to Lady Lufton to make much\nof Lucy's virtue at this present moment, but unjust to Lucy to make\nnothing of it.\n\n\"And she is actually with Mrs. Crawley now?\" asked Lady Lufton.\n\n\"Oh, yes; Mark left her there yesterday afternoon.\"\n\n\"And the four children are all here in the house?\"\n\n\"Not exactly in the house--that is, not as yet. We have arranged a\nsort of quarantine hospital over the coach-house.\"\n\n\"What, where Stubbs lives?\"\n\n\"Yes; Stubbs and his wife have come into the house, and the children\nare to remain up there till the doctor says that there is no danger\nof infection. I have not even seen my visitors myself as yet,\" said\nMrs. Robarts with a slight laugh.\n\n\"Dear me!\" said Lady Lufton. \"I declare you have been very prompt.\nAnd so Miss Robarts is over there! I should have thought Mr. Crawley\nwould have made a difficulty about the children.\"\n\n\"Well, he did; but they kidnapped them,--that is, Lucy and Mark did.\nThe dean gave me such an account of it. Lucy brought them out by twos\nand packed them in the pony-carriage, and then Mark drove off at a\ngallop while Mr. Crawley stood calling to them in the road. The dean\nwas there at the time and saw it all.\"\n\n\"That Miss Lucy of yours seems to be a very determined young lady\nwhen she takes a thing into her head,\" said Lady Lufton, now sitting\ndown for the first time.\n\n\"Yes, she is,\" said Mrs. Robarts, having laid aside all her pleasant\nanimation, for the discussion which she dreaded was now at hand.\n\n\"A very determined young lady,\" continued Lady Lufton. \"Of course, my\ndear Fanny, you know all this about Ludovic and your sister-in-law?\"\n\n\"Yes, she has told me about it.\"\n\n\"It is very unfortunate--very.\"\n\n\"I do not think Lucy has been to blame,\" said Mrs. Robarts; and as\nshe spoke the blood was already mounting to her cheeks.\n\n\"Do not be too anxious to defend her, my dear, before any one accuses\nher. Whenever a person does that it looks as though their cause were\nweak.\"\n\n\"But my cause is not weak as far as Lucy is concerned; I feel quite\nsure that she has not been to blame.\"\n\n\"I know how obstinate you can be, Fanny, when you think it necessary\nto dub yourself any one's champion. Don Quixote was not a better\nknight-errant than you are. But is it not a pity to take up your\nlance and shield before an enemy is within sight or hearing? But that\nwas ever the way with your Don Quixotes.\"\n\n\"Perhaps there may be an enemy in ambush.\" That was Mrs. Robarts'\nthought to herself, but she did not dare to express it, so she\nremained silent.\n\n\"My only hope is,\" continued Lady Lufton, \"that when my back is\nturned you fight as gallantly for me.\"\n\n\"Ah, you are never under a cloud, like poor Lucy.\"\n\n\"Am I not? But, Fanny, you do not see all the clouds. The sun does\nnot always shine for any of us, and the down-pouring rain and the\nheavy wind scatter also my fairest flowers,--as they have done hers,\npoor girl. Dear Fanny, I hope it may be long before any cloud comes\nacross the brightness of your heaven. Of all the creatures I know you\nare the one most fitted for quiet continued sunshine.\"\n\nAnd then Mrs. Robarts did get up and embrace her friend, thus hiding\nthe tears which were running down her face. Continued sunshine\nindeed! A dark spot had already gathered on her horizon which was\nlikely to fall in a very waterspout of rain. What was to come of that\nterrible notice which was now lying in the desk under Lady Lufton's\nvery arm?\n\n\"But I am not come here to croak like an old raven,\" continued Lady\nLufton, when she had brought this embrace to an end. \"It is probable\nthat we all may have our sorrows; but I am quite sure of this,--that\nif we endeavour to do our duties honestly, we shall all find our\nconsolation and all have our joys also. And now, my dear, let you\nand I say a few words about this unfortunate affair. It would not be\nnatural if we were to hold our tongues to each other; would it?\"\n\n\"I suppose not,\" said Mrs. Robarts.\n\n\"We should always be conceiving worse than the truth,--each as to the\nother's thoughts. Now, some time ago, when I spoke to you about your\nsister-in-law and Ludovic--I daresay you remember--\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I remember.\"\n\n\"We both thought then that there would really be no danger. To tell\nyou the plain truth I fancied, and indeed hoped, that his affections\nwere engaged elsewhere; but I was altogether wrong then; wrong in\nthinking it, and wrong in hoping it.\"\n\nMrs. Robarts knew well that Lady Lufton was alluding to Griselda\nGrantly, but she conceived that it would be discreet to say nothing\nherself on that subject at present. She remembered, however, Lucy's\nflashing eye when the possibility of Lord Lufton making such a\nmarriage was spoken of in the pony-carriage, and could not but feel\nglad that Lady Lufton had been disappointed.\n\n\"I do not at all impute any blame to Miss Robarts for what has\noccurred since,\" continued her ladyship. \"I wish you distinctly to\nunderstand that.\"\n\n\"I do not see how any one could blame her. She has behaved so nobly.\"\n\n\"It is of no use inquiring whether any one can. It is sufficient that\nI do not.\"\n\n\"But I think that is hardly sufficient,\" said Mrs. Robarts,\npertinaciously.\n\n\"Is it not?\" asked her ladyship, raising her eyebrows.\n\n\"No. Only think what Lucy has done and is doing. If she had chosen to\nsay that she would accept your son I really do not know how you could\nhave justly blamed her. I do not by any means say that I would have\nadvised such a thing.\"\n\n\"I am glad of that, Fanny.\"\n\n\"I have not given any advice; nor is it needed. I know no one more\nable than Lucy to see clearly, by her own judgment, what course she\nought to pursue. I should be afraid to advise one whose mind is so\nstrong, and who, of her own nature, is so self-denying as she is.\nShe is sacrificing herself now, because she will not be the means of\nbringing trouble and dissension between you and your son. If you ask\nme, Lady Lufton, I think you owe her a deep debt of gratitude. I do,\nindeed. And as for blaming her--what has she done that you possibly\ncould blame?\"\n\n\"Don Quixote on horseback!\" said Lady Lufton. \"Fanny, I shall always\ncall you Don Quixote, and some day or other I will get somebody to\nwrite your adventures. But the truth is this, my dear: there has been\nimprudence. You may call it mine, if you will--though I really hardly\nsee how I am to take the blame. I could not do other than ask Miss\nRobarts to my house, and I could not very well turn my son out of it.\nIn point of fact, it has been the old story.\"\n\n\"Exactly; the story that is as old as the world, and which will\ncontinue as long as people are born into it. It is a story of God's\nown telling!\"\n\n\"But, my dear child, you do not mean that every young gentleman and\nevery young lady should fall in love with each other directly they\nmeet! Such a doctrine would be very inconvenient.\"\n\n\"No, I do not mean that. Lord Lufton and Miss Grantly did not fall in\nlove with each other, though you meant them to do so. But was it not\nquite as natural that Lord Lufton and Lucy should do so instead?\"\n\n\"It is generally thought, Fanny, that young ladies should not give\nloose to their affections until they have been certified of their\nfriends' approval.\"\n\n\"And that young gentlemen of fortune may amuse themselves as they\nplease! I know that is what the world teaches, but I cannot agree to\nthe justice of it. The terrible suffering which Lucy has to endure\nmakes me cry out against it. She did not seek your son. The moment\nshe began to suspect that there might be danger she avoided him\nscrupulously. She would not go down to Framley Court, though her not\ndoing so was remarked by yourself. She would hardly go out about the\nplace lest she should meet him. She was contented to put herself\naltogether in the background till he should have pleased to leave the\nplace. But he--he came to her here, and insisted on seeing her. He\nfound her when I was out, and declared himself determined to speak to\nher. What was she to do? She did try to escape, but he stopped her at\nthe door. Was it her fault that he made her an offer?\"\n\n\"My dear, no one has said so.\"\n\n\"Yes, but you do say so when you tell me that young ladies should not\ngive play to their affections without permission. He persisted in\nsaying to her, here, all that it pleased him, though she implored him\nto be silent. I cannot tell the words she used, but she did implore\nhim.\"\n\n\"I do not doubt that she behaved well.\"\n\n\"But he--he persisted, and begged her to accept his hand. She refused\nhim then, Lady Lufton--not as some girls do, with a mock reserve, not\nintending to be taken at their words--but steadily, and, God forgive\nher, untruly. Knowing what your feelings would be, and knowing what\nthe world would say, she declared to him that he was indifferent to\nher. What more could she do in your behalf?\" And then Mrs. Robarts\npaused.\n\n\"I shall wait till you have done, Fanny.\"\n\n\"You spoke of girls giving loose to their affections. She did not do\nso. She went about her work exactly as she had done before. She did\nnot even speak to me of what had passed--not then, at least. She\ndetermined that it should all be as though it had never been. She\nhad learned to love your son; but that was her misfortune and she\nwould get over it as she might. Tidings came to us here that he was\nengaged, or about to engage himself, to Miss Grantly.\"\n\n\"Those tidings were untrue.\"\n\n\"Yes, we know that now; but she did not know it then. Of course she\ncould not but suffer; but she suffered within herself.\" Mrs. Robarts,\nas she said this, remembered the pony-carriage and how Puck had been\nbeaten. \"She made no complaint that he had ill-treated her--not even\nto herself. She had thought it right to reject his offer; and there,\nas far as he was concerned, was to be an end of it.\"\n\n\"That would be a matter of course, I should suppose.\"\n\n\"But it was not a matter of course, Lady Lufton. He returned from\nLondon to Framley on purpose to repeat his offer. He sent for her\nbrother-- You talk of a young lady waiting for her friends' approval.\nIn this matter who would be Lucy's friends?\"\n\n\"You and Mr. Robarts, of course.\"\n\n\"Exactly; her only friends. Well, Lord Lufton sent for Mark and\nrepeated his offer to him. Mind you, Mark had never heard a word of\nthis before, and you may guess whether or no he was surprised. Lord\nLufton repeated his offer in the most formal manner and claimed\npermission to see Lucy. She refused to see him. She has never seen\nhim since that day when, in opposition to all her efforts, he made\nhis way into this room. Mark,--as I think very properly,--would have\nallowed Lord Lufton to come up here. Looking at both their ages and\nposition he could have had no right to forbid it. But Lucy positively\nrefused to see your son, and sent him a message instead, of the\npurport of which you are now aware--that she would never accept him\nunless she did so at your request.\"\n\n\"It was a very proper message.\"\n\n\"I say nothing about that. Had she accepted him I would not have\nblamed her:--and so I told her, Lady Lufton.\"\n\n\"I cannot understand your saying that, Fanny.\"\n\n\"Well; I did say so. I don't want to argue now about myself,--whether\nI was right or wrong, but I did say so. Whatever sanction I could\ngive she would have had. But she again chose to sacrifice herself,\nalthough I believe she regards him with as true a love as ever a girl\nfelt for a man. Upon my word I don't know that she is right. Those\nconsiderations for the world may perhaps be carried too far.\"\n\n\"I think that she was perfectly right.\"\n\n\"Very well, Lady Lufton; I can understand that. But after such\nsacrifice on her part--a sacrifice made entirely to you--how can you\ntalk of 'not blaming her'? Is that the language in which you speak\nof those whose conduct from first to last has been superlatively\nexcellent? If she is open to blame at all, it is--it is--\"\n\nBut here Mrs. Robarts stopped herself. In defending her sister she\nhad worked herself almost into a passion; but such a state of feeling\nwas not customary to her, and now that she had spoken her mind she\nsank suddenly into silence.\n\n\"It seems to me, Fanny, that you almost regret Miss Robarts'\ndecision,\" said Lady Lufton.\n\n\"My wish in this matter is for her happiness, and I regret anything\nthat may mar it.\"\n\n\"You think nothing then of our welfare, and yet I do not know to whom\nI might have looked for hearty friendship and for sympathy in\ndifficulties, if not to you?\"\n\nPoor Mrs. Robarts was almost upset by this. A few months ago, before\nLucy's arrival, she would have declared that the interests of Lady\nLufton's family would have been paramount with her, after and next to\nthose of her own husband. And even now, it seemed to argue so black\nan ingratitude on her part--this accusation that she was indifferent\nto them! From her childhood upwards she had revered and loved Lady\nLufton, and for years had taught herself to regard her as an epitome\nof all that was good and gracious in woman. Lady Lufton's theories of\nlife had been accepted by her as the right theories, and those whom\nLady Lufton had liked she had liked. But now it seemed that all these\nideas which it had taken a life to build up were to be thrown to the\nground, because she was bound to defend a sister-in-law whom she had\nonly known for the last eight months. It was not that she regretted a\nword that she had spoken on Lucy's behalf. Chance had thrown her and\nLucy together, and, as Lucy was her sister, she should receive from\nher a sister's treatment. But she did not the less feel how terrible\nwould be the effect of any disseverance from Lady Lufton.\n\n\"Oh, Lady Lufton,\" she said, \"do not say that.\"\n\n\"But, Fanny, dear, I must speak as I find. You were talking about\nclouds just now, and do you think that all this is not a cloud in my\nsky? Ludovic tells me that he is attached to Miss Robarts, and you\ntell me that she is attached to him; and I am called upon to decide\nbetween them. Her very act obliges me to do so.\"\n\n\"Dear Lady Lufton,\" said Mrs. Robarts, springing from her seat. It\nseemed to her at the moment as though the whole difficulty were to be\nsolved by an act of grace on the part of her old friend.\n\n\"And yet I cannot approve of such a marriage,\" said Lady Lufton.\n\nMrs. Robarts returned to her seat, saying nothing further.\n\n\"Is not that a cloud on one's horizon?\" continued her ladyship. \"Do\nyou think that I can be basking in the sunshine while I have such a\nweight upon my heart as that? Ludovic will soon be home, but instead\nof looking to his return with pleasure I dread it. I would prefer\nthat he should remain in Norway. I would wish that he should stay\naway for months. And, Fanny, it is a great addition to my misfortune\nto feel that you do not sympathize with me.\"\n\nHaving said this, in a slow, sorrowful, and severe tone, Lady Lufton\ngot up and took her departure. Of course Mrs. Robarts did not let her\ngo without assuring her that she did sympathize with her,--did love\nher as she ever had loved her. But wounds cannot be cured as easily\nas they may be inflicted, and Lady Lufton went her way with much real\nsorrow at her heart. She was proud and masterful, fond of her own\nway, and much too careful of the worldly dignities to which her lot\nhad called her: but she was a woman who could cause no sorrow to\nthose she loved without deep sorrow to herself.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII.\n\nTOUCHING PITCH.\n\n\nIn these hot midsummer days, the end of June and the beginning of\nJuly, Mr. Sowerby had but an uneasy time of it. At his sister's\ninstance, he had hurried up to London, and there had remained for\ndays in attendance on the lawyers. He had to see new lawyers, Miss\nDunstable's men of business, quiet old cautious gentlemen whose\nplace of business was in a dark alley behind the Bank, Messrs. Slow\nand Bideawhile by name, who had no scruple in detaining him for\nhours while they or their clerks talked to him about anything or\nabout nothing. It was of vital consequence to Mr. Sowerby that this\nbusiness of his should be settled without delay, and yet these men,\nto whose care this settling was now confided, went on as though law\nprocesses were a sunny bank on which it delighted men to bask easily.\nAnd then, too, he had to go more than once to South Audley Street,\nwhich was a worse infliction; for the men in South Audley Street\nwere less civil now than had been their wont. It was well understood\nthere that Mr. Sowerby was no longer a client of the duke's, but\nhis opponent; no longer his nominee and dependant, but his enemy in\nthe county. \"Chaldicotes,\" as old Mr. Gumption remarked to young Mr.\nGagebee; \"Chaldicotes, Gagebee, is a cooked goose, as far as Sowerby\nis concerned. And what difference could it make to him whether the\nduke is to own it or Miss Dunstable? For my part I cannot understand\nhow a gentleman like Sowerby can like to see his property go into the\nhands of a gallipot wench whose money still smells of bad drugs. And\nnothing can be more ungrateful,\" he said, \"than Sowerby's conduct.\nHe has held the county for five-and-twenty years without expense;\nand now that the time for payment has come, he begrudges the price.\"\nHe called it no better than cheating, he did not--he, Mr. Gumption.\nAccording to his ideas Sowerby was attempting to cheat the duke. It\nmay be imagined, therefore, that Mr. Sowerby did not feel any very\ngreat delight in attending at South Audley Street.\n\nAnd then rumour was spread about among all the bill-discounting\nleeches that blood was once more to be sucked from the Sowerby\ncarcase. The rich Miss Dunstable had taken up his affairs; so much\nas that became known in the purlieus of the Goat and Compasses. Tom\nTozer's brother declared that she and Sowerby were going to make\na match of it, and that any scrap of paper with Sowerby's name\non it would become worth its weight in bank-notes; but Tom Tozer\nhimself--Tom, who was the real hero of the family--pooh-poohed at\nthis, screwing up his nose, and alluding in most contemptuous terms\nto his brother's softness. He knew better--as was indeed the fact.\nMiss Dunstable was buying up the squire, and by jingo she should buy\nthem up--them, the Tozers, as well as others! They knew their value,\nthe Tozers did;--whereupon they became more than ordinarily active.\n\nFrom them and all their brethren Mr. Sowerby at this time endeavoured\nto keep his distance, but his endeavours were not altogether\neffectual. Whenever he could escape for a day or two from the lawyers\nhe ran down to Chaldicotes; but Tom Tozer in his perseverance\nfollowed him there, and boldly sent in his name by the servant at the\nfront-door.\n\n\"Mr. Sowerby is not just at home at the present moment,\" said the\nwell-trained domestic.\n\n\"I'll wait about then,\" said Tom, seating himself on an heraldic\nstone griffin which flanked the big stone steps before the house.\nAnd in this way Mr. Tozer gained his purpose. Sowerby was still\ncontesting the county, and it behoved him not to let his enemies say\nthat he was hiding himself. It had been a part of his bargain with\nMiss Dunstable that he should contest the county. She had taken it\ninto her head that the duke had behaved badly, and she had resolved\nthat he should be made to pay for it. \"The duke,\" she said, \"had\nmeddled long enough;\" she would now see whether the Chaldicotes\ninterest would not suffice of itself to return a member for the\ncounty, even in opposition to the duke. Mr. Sowerby himself was so\nharassed at the time, that he would have given way on this point if\nhe had had the power; but Miss Dunstable was determined, and he was\nobliged to yield to her. In this manner Mr. Tom Tozer succeeded and\ndid make his way into Mr. Sowerby's presence--of which intrusion one\neffect was the following letter from Mr. Sowerby to his friend Mark\nRobarts:--\n\n\n   Chaldicotes, July, 185--.\n\n   MY DEAR ROBARTS,--I am so harassed at the present moment\n   by an infinity of troubles of my own that I am almost\n   callous to those of other people. They say that prosperity\n   makes a man selfish. I have never tried that, but I am\n   quite sure that adversity does so. Nevertheless I am\n   anxious about those bills of yours--\n\n\n\"Bills of mine!\" said Robarts to himself, as he walked up and down\nthe shrubbery path at the parsonage, reading this letter. This\nhappened a day or two after his visit to the lawyer at Barchester.\n\n\n   --and would rejoice greatly if I thought that I could\n   save you from any further annoyance about them. That kite,\n   Tom Tozer, has just been with me, and insists that both\n   of them shall be paid. He knows--no one better--that no\n   consideration was given for the latter. But he knows also\n   that the dealing was not with him, nor even with his\n   brother, and he will be prepared to swear that he gave\n   value for both. He would swear anything for five hundred\n   pounds--or for half the money, for that matter. I do not\n   think that the father of mischief ever let loose upon the\n   world a greater rascal than Tom Tozer.\n\n   He declares that nothing shall induce him to take one\n   shilling less than the whole sum of nine hundred pounds.\n   He has been brought to this by hearing that my debts are\n   about to be paid. Heaven help me! The meaning of that is\n   that these wretched acres, which are now mortgaged to one\n   millionnaire, are to change hands and be mortgaged to\n   another instead. By this exchange I may possibly obtain\n   the benefit of having a house to live in for the next\n   twelve months, but no other. Tozer, however, is altogether\n   wrong in his scent; and the worst of it is that his malice\n   will fall on you rather than on me.\n\n   What I want you to do is this: let us pay him one hundred\n   pounds between us. Though I sell the last sorry jade of a\n   horse I have, I will make up fifty; and I know you can, at\n   any rate, do as much as that. Then do you accept a bill,\n   conjointly with me, for eight hundred. It shall be done\n   in Forrest's presence, and handed to him; and you shall\n   receive back the two old bills into your own hands at the\n   same time. This new bill should be timed to run ninety\n   days; and I will move heaven and earth during that time to\n   have it included in the general schedule of my debts which\n   are to be secured on the Chaldicotes property.\n\n\nThe meaning of which was that Miss Dunstable was to be cozened into\npaying the money under an idea that it was part of the sum covered by\nthe existing mortgage.\n\n\n   What you said the other day at Barchester, as to never\n   executing another bill, is very well as regards future\n   transactions. Nothing can be wiser than such a resolution.\n   But it would be folly--worse than folly--if you were\n   to allow your furniture to be seized when the means of\n   preventing it are so ready to your hand. By leaving the\n   new bill in Forrest's hands you may be sure that you are\n   safe from the claws of such birds of prey as these Tozers.\n   Even if I cannot get it settled when the three months are\n   over, Forrest will enable you to make any arrangement that\n   may be most convenient.\n\n   For Heaven's sake, my dear fellow, do not refuse this.\n   You can hardly conceive how it weighs upon me, this fear\n   that bailiffs should make their way into your wife's\n   drawing-room. I know you think ill of me, and I do not\n   wonder at it. But you would be less inclined to do so if\n   you knew how terribly I am punished. Pray let me hear that\n   you will do as I counsel you.\n\n   Yours always faithfully,\n\n   N. SOWERBY.\n\n\nIn answer to which the parson wrote a very short reply:--\n\n\n   Framley, July, 185--.\n\n   MY DEAR SOWERBY,--\n\n   I will sign no more bills on any consideration.\n\n   Yours truly,\n\n   MARK ROBARTS.\n\n\nAnd then having written this, and having shown it to his wife, he\nreturned to the shrubbery walk and paced it up and down, looking\nevery now and then to Sowerby's letter as he thought over all the\npast circumstances of his friendship with that gentleman.\n\nThat the man who had written this letter should be his friend--that\nvery fact was a disgrace to him. Sowerby so well knew himself and his\nown reputation, that he did not dare to suppose that his own word\nwould be taken for anything,--not even when the thing promised was an\nact of the commonest honesty. \"The old bills shall be given back into\nyour own hands,\" he had declared with energy, knowing that his friend\nand correspondent would not feel himself secure against further fraud\nunder any less stringent guarantee. This gentleman, this county\nmember, the owner of Chaldicotes, with whom Mark Robarts had been so\nanxious to be on terms of intimacy, had now come to such a phase of\nlife that he had given over speaking of himself as an honest man. He\nhad become so used to suspicion that he argued of it as of a thing\nof course. He knew that no one could trust either his spoken or\nhis written word, and he was content to speak and to write without\nattempt to hide this conviction.\n\nAnd this was the man whom he had been so glad to call his friend; for\nwhose sake he had been willing to quarrel with Lady Lufton, and at\nwhose instance he had unconsciously abandoned so many of the best\nresolutions of his life. He looked back now, as he walked there\nslowly, still holding the letter in his hand, to the day when he had\nstopped at the school-house and written his letter to Mr. Sowerby,\npromising to join the party at Chaldicotes. He had been so eager then\nto have his own way, that he would not permit himself to go home and\ntalk the matter over with his wife. He thought also of the manner in\nwhich he had been tempted to the house of the Duke of Omnium, and\nthe conviction on his mind at the time that his giving way to that\ntemptation would surely bring him to evil. And then he remembered the\nevening in Sowerby's bedroom, when the bill had been brought out, and\nhe had allowed himself to be persuaded to put his name upon it;--not\nbecause he was willing in this way to assist his friend, but because\nhe was unable to refuse. He had lacked the courage to say, \"No,\"\nthough he knew at the time how gross was the error which he was\ncommitting. He had lacked the courage to say, \"No,\" and hence had\ncome upon him and on his household all this misery and cause for\nbitter repentance.\n\nI have written much of clergymen, but in doing so I have endeavoured\nto portray them as they bear on our social life rather than to\ndescribe the mode and working of their professional careers. Had\nI done the latter I could hardly have steered clear of subjects on\nwhich it has not been my intention to pronounce an opinion, and I\nshould either have laden my fiction with sermons or I should have\ndegraded my sermons into fiction. Therefore I have said but little in\nmy narrative of this man's feelings or doings as a clergyman.\n\nBut I must protest against its being on this account considered that\nMr. Robarts was indifferent to the duties of his clerical position.\nHe had been fond of pleasure and had given way to temptation,--as is\nso customarily done by young men of six-and-twenty, who are placed\nbeyond control and who have means at command. Had he remained as a\ncurate till that age, subject in all his movements to the eye of\na superior, he would, we may say, have put his name to no bills,\nhave ridden after no hounds, have seen nothing of the iniquities of\nGatherum Castle. There are men of twenty-six as fit to stand alone\nas ever they will be--fit to be prime ministers, heads of schools,\njudges on the bench--almost fit to be bishops; but Mark Robarts had\nnot been one of them. He had within him many aptitudes for good, but\nnot the strengthened courage of a man to act up to them. The stuff of\nwhich his manhood was to be formed had been slow of growth, as it is\nwith many men; and, consequently, when temptation was offered to him,\nhe had fallen.\n\nBut he deeply grieved over his own stumbling, and from time to time,\nas his periods of penitence came upon him, he resolved that he would\nonce more put his shoulder to the wheel as became one who fights\nupon earth that battle for which he had put on his armour. Over and\nover again did he think of those words of Mr. Crawley, and now as\nhe walked up and down the path, crumpling Mr. Sowerby's letter in\nhis hand, he thought of them again--\"It is a terrible falling off;\nterrible in the fall, but doubly terrible through that difficulty\nof returning.\" Yes; that is a difficulty which multiplies itself\nin a fearful ratio as one goes on pleasantly running down the\npath--whitherward? Had it come to that with him that he could not\nreturn--that he could never again hold up his head with a safe\nconscience as the pastor of his parish! It was Sowerby who had led\nhim into this misery, who had brought on him this ruin? But then\nhad not Sowerby paid him? Had not that stall which he now held in\nBarchester been Sowerby's gift? He was a poor man now--a distressed,\npoverty-stricken man; but nevertheless he wished with all his\nheart that he had never become a sharer in the good things of the\nBarchester chapter.\n\n\"I shall resign the stall,\" he said to his wife that night. \"I think\nI may say that I have made up my mind as to that.\"\n\n\"But, Mark, will not people say that it is odd?\"\n\n\"I cannot help it--they must say it. Fanny, I fear that we shall have\nto bear the saying of harder words than that.\"\n\n\"Nobody can ever say that you have done anything that is unjust or\ndishonourable. If there are such men as Mr. Sowerby--\"\n\n\"The blackness of his fault will not excuse mine.\" And then again he\nsat silent, hiding his eyes, while his wife, sitting by him, held his\nhand.\n\n\"Don't make yourself wretched, Mark. Matters will all come right yet.\nIt cannot be that the loss of a few hundred pounds should ruin you.\"\n\n\"It is not the money--it is not the money!\"\n\n\"But you have done nothing wrong, Mark.\"\n\n\"How am I to go into the church, and take my place before them all,\nwhen every one will know that bailiffs are in the house?\" And then,\ndropping his head on to the table, he sobbed aloud.\n\nMark Robarts' mistake had been mainly this,--he had thought to touch\npitch and not to be defiled. He, looking out from his pleasant\nparsonage into the pleasant upper ranks of the world around him, had\nseen that men and things in those quarters were very engaging. His\nown parsonage, with his sweet wife, were exceedingly dear to him, and\nLady Lufton's affectionate friendship had its value; but were not\nthese things rather dull for one who had lived in the best sets at\nHarrow and Oxford;--unless, indeed, he could supplement them with\nsome occasional bursts of more lively life? Cakes and ale were as\npleasant to his palate as to the palates of those with whom he had\nformerly lived at college. He had the same eye to look at a horse,\nand the same heart to make him go across a country, as they. And\nthen, too, he found that men liked him,--men and women also; men and\nwomen who were high in worldly standing. His ass's ears were tickled,\nand he learned to fancy that he was intended by nature for the\nsociety of high people. It seemed as though he were following his\nappointed course in meeting men and women of the world at the houses\nof the fashionable and the rich. He was not the first clergyman that\nhad so lived and had so prospered. Yes, clergymen had so lived, and\nhad done their duties in their sphere of life altogether to the\nsatisfaction of their countrymen--and of their sovereigns. Thus\nMark Robarts had determined that he would touch pitch, and escape\ndefilement if that were possible. With what result those who have\nread so far will have perceived.\n\nLate on the following afternoon who should drive up to the parsonage\ndoor but Mr. Forrest, the bank manager from Barchester--Mr. Forrest,\nto whom Sowerby had always pointed as the _Deus ex machin\u00c3\u00a2_ who, if\nduly invoked, could relieve them all from their present troubles, and\ndismiss the whole Tozer family--not howling into the wilderness, as\none would have wished to do with that brood of Tozers, but so gorged\nwith prey that from them no further annoyance need be dreaded? All\nthis Mr. Forrest could do; nay, more, most willingly would do! Only\nlet Mark Robarts put himself into the banker's hand, and blandly sign\nwhat documents the banker might desire.\n\n\"This is a very unpleasant affair,\" said Mr. Forrest as soon as\nthey were closeted together in Mark's book-room. In answer to which\nobservation the parson acknowledged that it was a very unpleasant\naffair.\n\n\"Mr. Sowerby has managed to put you into the hands of about the worst\nset of rogues now existing, in their line of business, in London.\"\n\n\"So I supposed; Curling told me the same.\" Curling was the Barchester\nattorney whose aid he had lately invoked.\n\n\"Curling has threatened them that he will expose their whole trade;\nbut one of them who was down here, a man named Tozer, replied, that\nyou had much more to lose by exposure than he had. He went further\nand declared that he would defy any jury in England to refuse him his\nmoney. He swore that he discounted both bills in the regular way of\nbusiness; and, though this is of course false, I fear that it will\nbe impossible to prove it so. He well knows that you are a clergyman,\nand that, therefore, he has a stronger hold on you than on other\nmen.\"\n\n\"The disgrace shall fall on Sowerby,\" said Robarts, hardly actuated\nat the moment by any strong feeling of Christian forgiveness.\n\n\"I fear, Mr. Robarts, that he is somewhat in the condition of the\nTozers. He will not feel it as you will do.\"\n\n\"I must bear it, Mr. Forrest, as best I may.\"\n\n\"Will you allow me, Mr. Robarts, to give you my advice? Perhaps\nI ought to apologize for intruding it upon you; but as the bills\nhave been presented and dishonoured across my counter, I have, of\nnecessity, become acquainted with the circumstances.\"\n\n\"I am sure I am very much obliged to you,\" said Mark.\n\n\"You must pay this money, or, at any rate, the most considerable\nportion of it;--the whole of it, indeed, with such deduction as a\nlawyer may be able to induce these hawks to make on the sight of the\nready money. Perhaps \u00c2\u00a3750 or \u00c2\u00a3800 may see you clear of the whole\naffair.\"\n\n\"But I have not a quarter of that sum lying by me.\"\n\n\"No, I suppose not; but what I would recommend is this:\nthat you should borrow the money from the bank, on your own\nresponsibility,--with the joint security of some friend who may be\nwilling to assist you with his name. Lord Lufton probably would do\nit.\"\n\n\"No, Mr. Forrest--\"\n\n\"Listen to me first, before you make up your mind. If you took this\nstep, of course you would do so with the fixed intention of paying\nthe money yourself,--without any further reliance on Sowerby or on\nany one else.\"\n\n\"I shall not rely on Mr. Sowerby again; you may be sure of that.\"\n\n\"What I mean is that you must teach yourself to recognize the debt as\nyour own. If you can do that, with your income you can surely pay it,\nwith interest, in two years. If Lord Lufton will assist you with\nhis name I will so arrange the bills that the payments shall be made\nto fall equally over that period. In that way the world will know\nnothing about it, and in two years' time you will once more be a free\nman. Many men, Mr. Robarts, have bought their experience much dearer\nthan that, I can assure you.\"\n\n\"Mr. Forrest, it is quite out of the question.\"\n\n\"You mean that Lord Lufton will not give you his name.\"\n\n\"I certainly shall not ask him; but that is not all. In the first\nplace my income will not be what you think it, for I shall probably\ngive up the prebend at Barchester.\"\n\n\"Give up the prebend! give up six hundred a year!\"\n\n\"And, beyond this, I think I may say that nothing shall tempt me to\nput my name to another bill. I have learned a lesson which I hope I\nmay never forget.\"\n\n\"Then what do you intend to do?\"\n\n\"Nothing!\"\n\n\"Then those men will sell every stick of furniture about the place.\nThey know that your property here is enough to secure all that they\nclaim.\"\n\n\"If they have the power, they must sell it.\"\n\n\"And all the world will know the facts.\"\n\n\"So it must be. Of the faults which a man commits he must bear the\npunishment. If it were only myself!\"\n\n\"That's where it is, Mr. Robarts. Think what your wife will have to\nsuffer in going through such misery as that! You had better take my\nadvice. Lord Lufton, I am sure--\"\n\nBut the very name of Lord Lufton, his sister's lover, again gave him\ncourage. He thought, too, of the accusations which Lord Lufton had\nbrought against him on that night when he had come to him in the\ncoffee-room of the hotel, and he felt that it was impossible that he\nshould apply to him for such aid. It would be better to tell all to\nLady Lufton! That she would relieve him, let the cost to herself be\nwhat it might, he was very sure. Only this;--that in looking to her\nfor assistance he would be forced to bite the dust in very deed.\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. Forrest, but I have made up my mind. Do not\nthink that I am the less obliged to you for your disinterested\nkindness,--for I know that it is disinterested; but this I think I\nmay confidently say, that not even to avert so terrible a calamity\nwill I again put my name to any bill. Even if you could take my own\npromise to pay without the addition of any second name, I would not\ndo it.\"\n\nThere was nothing for Mr. Forrest to do under such circumstances but\nsimply to drive back to Barchester. He had done the best for the\nyoung clergyman according to his lights, and perhaps, in a worldly\nview, his advice had not been bad. But Mark dreaded the very name of\na bill. He was as a dog that had been terribly scorched, and nothing\nshould again induce him to go near the fire.\n\n\"Was not that the man from the bank?\" said Fanny, coming into the\nroom when the sound of the wheels had died away.\n\n\"Yes; Mr. Forrest.\"\n\n\"Well, dearest?\"\n\n\"We must prepare ourselves for the worst.\"\n\n\"You will not sign any more papers, eh, Mark?\"\n\n\"No; I have just now positively refused to do so.\"\n\n\"Then I can bear anything. But, dearest, dearest Mark, will you not\nlet me tell Lady Lufton?\"\n\nLet them look at the matter in any way the punishment was very heavy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII.\n\nIS SHE NOT INSIGNIFICANT?\n\n\nAnd now a month went by at Framley without any increase of comfort to\nour friends there, and also without any absolute development of the\nruin which had been daily expected at the parsonage. Sundry letters\nhad reached Mr. Robarts from various personages acting in the Tozer\ninterest, all of which he referred to Mr. Curling, of Barchester.\nSome of these letters contained prayers for the money, pointing out\nhow an innocent widow lady had been induced to invest her all on\nthe faith of Mr. Robarts' name, and was now starving in a garret,\nwith her three children, because Mr. Robarts would not make good\nhis own undertakings. But the majority of them were filled with\nthreats;--only two days longer would be allowed and then the\nsheriff's officers would be enjoined to do their work; then one day\nof grace would be added, at the expiration of which the dogs of war\nwould be unloosed. These, as fast as they came, were sent to Mr.\nCurling, who took no notice of them individually, but continued his\nendeavour to prevent the evil day. The second bill Mr. Robarts would\ntake up--such was Mr. Curling's proposition; and would pay by two\ninstalments of \u00c2\u00a3250 each, the first in two months, and the second\nin four. If this were acceptable to the Tozer interest--well; if it\nwere not, the sheriff's officers must do their worst and the Tozer\ninterest must look for what it could get. The Tozer interest would\nnot declare itself satisfied with these terms, and so the matter went\non. During which the roses faded from day to day on the cheeks of\nMrs. Robarts, as under such circumstances may easily be conceived.\n\nIn the meantime Lucy still remained at Hogglestock and had there\nbecome absolute mistress of the house. Poor Mrs. Crawley had been\nat death's door; for some days she was delirious, and afterwards\nremained so weak as to be almost unconscious; but now the worst\nwas over, and Mr. Crawley had been informed, that as far as human\njudgment might pronounce, his children would not become orphans nor\nwould he become a widower. During these weeks Lucy had not once been\nhome nor had she seen any of the Framley people. \"Why should she\nincur the risk of conveying infection for so small an object?\" as she\nherself argued, writing by letters, which were duly fumigated before\nthey were opened at the parsonage. So she remained at Hogglestock,\nand the Crawley children, now admitted to all the honours of the\nnursery, were kept at Framley. They were kept at Framley, although it\nwas expected from day to day that the beds on which they lay would be\nseized for the payment of Mr. Sowerby's debts.\n\nLucy, as I have said, became mistress of the house at Hogglestock\nand made herself absolutely ascendant over Mr. Crawley. Jellies, and\nbroth, and fruit, and even butter, came from Lufton Court, which she\ndisplayed on the table, absolutely on the cloth before him, and yet\nhe bore it. I cannot say that he partook of these delicacies with any\nfreedom himself, but he did drink his tea when it was given to him\nalthough it contained Framley cream;--and, had he known it, Bohea\nitself from the Framley chest. In truth, in these days, he had given\nhimself over to the dominion of this stranger; and he said nothing\nbeyond, \"Well, well,\" with two uplifted hands, when he came upon her\nas she was sewing the buttons on to his own shirts--sewing on the\nbuttons and perhaps occasionally applying her needle elsewhere,--not\nwithout utility.\n\nHe said to her at this period very little in the way of thanks. Some\nprotracted conversations they did have, now and again, during the\nlong evenings; but even in these he did not utter many words as to\ntheir present state of life. It was on religion chiefly that he\nspoke, not lecturing her individually, but laying down his ideas as\nto what the life of a Christian should be, and especially what should\nbe the life of a minister. \"But though I can see this, Miss Robarts,\"\nhe said, \"I am bound to say that no one has fallen off so frequently\nas myself. I have renounced the devil and all his works; but it is by\nword of mouth only--by word of mouth only. How shall a man crucify\nthe old Adam that is within him, unless he throw himself prostrate in\nthe dust and acknowledge that all his strength is weaker than water?\"\nTo this, often as it might be repeated, she would listen patiently,\ncomforting him by such words as her theology would supply; but then,\nwhen this was over, she would again resume her command and enforce\nfrom him a close obedience to her domestic behests.\n\nAt the end of the month Lord Lufton came back to Framley Court. His\narrival there was quite unexpected; though, as he pointed out when\nhis mother expressed some surprise, he had returned exactly at the\ntime named by him before he started.\n\n\"I need not say, Ludovic, how glad I am to have you,\" said she,\nlooking to his face and pressing his arm; \"the more so, indeed,\nseeing that I hardly expected it.\"\n\nHe said nothing to his mother about Lucy the first evening, although\nthere was some conversation respecting the Robarts family.\n\n\"I am afraid Mr. Robarts has embarrassed himself,\" said Lady Lufton,\nlooking very seriously. \"Rumours reach me which are most distressing.\nI have said nothing to anybody as yet--not even to Fanny; but I can\nsee in her face, and hear in the tones of her voice, that she is\nsuffering some great sorrow.\"\n\n\"I know all about it,\" said Lord Lufton.\n\n\"You know all about it, Ludovic?\"\n\n\"Yes; it is through that precious friend of mine, Mr. Sowerby, of\nChaldicotes. He has accepted bills for Sowerby; indeed, he told me\nso.\"\n\n\"What business had he at Chaldicotes? What had he to do with such\nfriends as that? I do not know how I am to forgive him.\"\n\n\"It was through me that he became acquainted with Sowerby. You must\nremember that, mother.\"\n\n\"I do not see that that is any excuse. Is he to consider that\nall your acquaintances must necessarily be his friends also? It\nis reasonable to suppose that you in your position must live\noccasionally with a great many people who are altogether unfit\ncompanions for him as a parish clergyman. He will not remember this,\nand he must be taught it. What business had he to go to Gatherum\nCastle?\"\n\n\"He got his stall at Barchester by going there.\"\n\n\"He would be much better without his stall, and Fanny has the sense\nto know this. What does he want with two houses? Prebendal stalls are\nfor older men than he--for men who have earned them, and who at the\nend of their lives want some ease. I wish with all my heart that he\nhad never taken it.\"\n\n\"Six hundred a year has its charms all the same,\" said Lufton,\ngetting up and strolling out of the room.\n\n\"If Mark really be in any difficulty,\" he said, later in the evening,\n\"we must put him on his legs.\"\n\n\"You mean, pay his debts?\"\n\n\"Yes; he has no debts except these acceptances of Sowerby's.\"\n\n\"How much will it be, Ludovic?\"\n\n\"A thousand pounds, perhaps, more or less. I'll find the money,\nmother; only I shan't be able to pay you quite as soon as I\nintended.\" Whereupon his mother got up, and throwing her arms round\nhis neck declared that she would never forgive him if he ever said\na word more about her little present to him. I suppose there is no\npleasure a mother can have more attractive than giving away her money\nto an only son.\n\nLucy's name was first mentioned at breakfast the next morning. Lord\nLufton had made up his mind to attack his mother on the subject early\nin the morning--before he went up to the parsonage; but as matters\nturned out Miss Robarts' doings were necessarily brought under\ndiscussion without reference to Lord Lufton's special aspirations\nregarding her. The fact of Mrs. Crawley's illness had been mentioned,\nand Lady Lufton had stated how it had come to pass that all the\nCrawleys' children were at the parsonage.\n\n\"I must say that Fanny has behaved excellently,\" said Lady Lufton.\n\"It was just what might have been expected from her. And indeed,\" she\nadded, speaking in an embarrassed tone, \"so has Miss Robarts. Miss\nRobarts has remained at Hogglestock and nursed Mrs. Crawley through\nthe whole.\"\n\n\"Remained at Hogglestock--through the fever!\" exclaimed his lordship.\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" said Lady Lufton.\n\n\"And is she there now?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; I am not aware that she thinks of leaving just yet.\"\n\n\"Then I say that it is a great shame--a scandalous shame!\"\n\n\"But, Ludovic, it was her own doing.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; I understand. But why should she be sacrificed? Were there\nno nurses in the country to be hired, but that she must go and remain\nthere for a month at the bedside of a pestilent fever? There is no\njustice in it.\"\n\n\"Justice, Ludovic? I don't know about justice, but there was great\nChristian charity. Mrs. Crawley has probably owed her life to Miss\nRobarts.\"\n\n\"Has she been ill? Is she ill? I insist upon knowing whether she\nis ill. I shall go over to Hogglestock myself immediately after\nbreakfast.\"\n\nTo this Lady Lufton made no reply. If Lord Lufton chose to go to\nHogglestock she could not prevent him. She thought, however, that it\nwould be much better that he should stay away. He would be quite as\nopen to the infection as Lucy Robarts; and, moreover, Mrs. Crawley's\nbedside would be as inconvenient a place as might be selected for\nany interview between two lovers. Lady Lufton felt at the present\nmoment that she was cruelly treated by circumstances with reference\nto Miss Robarts. Of course it would have been her part to lessen,\nif she could do so without injustice, that high idea which her\nson entertained of the beauty and worth of the young lady; but,\nunfortunately, she had been compelled to praise her and to load her\nname with all manner of eulogy. Lady Lufton was essentially a true\nwoman, and not even with the object of carrying out her own views in\nso important a matter would she be guilty of such deception as she\nmight have practised by simply holding her tongue; but nevertheless\nshe could hardly reconcile herself to the necessity of singing Lucy's\npraises.\n\nAfter breakfast Lady Lufton got up from her chair, but hung about the\nroom without making any show of leaving. In accordance with her usual\ncustom she would have asked her son what he was going to do; but\nshe did not dare so to inquire now. Had he not declared, only a few\nminutes since, whither he would go? \"I suppose I shall see you at\nlunch?\" at last she said.\n\n\"At lunch? Well, I don't know. Look here, mother. What am I to say to\nMiss Robarts when I see her?\" and he leaned with his back against the\nchimney-piece as he interrogated his mother.\n\n\"What are you to say to her, Ludovic?\"\n\n\"Yes; what am I to say,--as coming from you? Am I to tell her that\nyou will receive her as your daughter-in-law?\"\n\n\"Ludovic, I have explained all that to Miss Robarts herself.\"\n\n\"Explained what?\"\n\n\"I have told her that I did not think that such a marriage would make\neither you or her happy.\"\n\n\"And why have you told her so? Why have you taken upon yourself to\njudge for me in such a matter, as though I were a child? Mother, you\nmust unsay what you have said.\"\n\nLord Lufton, as he spoke, looked full into his mother's face; and\nhe did so, not as though he were begging from her a favour, but\nissuing to her a command. She stood near him, with one hand on the\nbreakfast-table, gazing at him almost furtively, not quite daring\nto meet the full view of his eye. There was only one thing on earth\nwhich Lady Lufton feared, and that was her son's displeasure. The\nsun of her earthly heaven shone upon her through the medium of his\nexistence. If she were driven to quarrel with him, as some ladies of\nher acquaintance were driven to quarrel with their sons, the world\nto her would be over. Not but what facts might be so strong as to\nmake it absolutely necessary that she should do this. As some people\nresolve that, under certain circumstances, they will commit suicide,\nso she could see that, under certain circumstances, she must consent\neven to be separated from him. She would not do wrong,--not that\nwhich she knew to be wrong,--even for his sake. If it were necessary\nthat all her happiness should collapse and be crushed in ruin around\nher, she must endure it, and wait God's time to relieve her from so\ndark a world. The light of the sun was very dear to her, but even\nthat might be purchased at too dear a cost.\n\n\"I told you before, mother, that my choice was made, and I asked you\nthen to give your consent; you have now had time to think about it,\nand therefore I have come to ask you again. I have reason to know\nthat there will be no impediment to my marriage if you will frankly\nhold out your hand to Lucy.\"\n\nThe matter was altogether in Lady Lufton's hands, but, fond as she\nwas of power, she absolutely wished that it were not so. Had her son\nmarried without asking her and then brought Lucy home as his wife,\nshe would undoubtedly have forgiven him; and much as she might have\ndisliked the match, she would, ultimately, have embraced the bride.\nBut now she was compelled to exercise her judgment. If he married\nimprudently, it would be her doing. How was she to give her expressed\nconsent to that which she believed to be wrong?\n\n\"Do you know anything against her; any reason why she should not be\nmy wife?\" continued he.\n\n\"If you mean as regards her moral conduct, certainly not,\" said Lady\nLufton. \"But I could say as much as that in favour of a great many\nyoung ladies whom I should regard as very ill suited for such a\nmarriage.\"\n\n\"Yes; some might be vulgar, some might be ill-tempered, some might be\nugly; others might be burdened with disagreeable connections. I can\nunderstand that you should object to a daughter-in-law under any of\nthese circumstances. But none of these things can be said of Miss\nRobarts. I defy you to say that she is not in all respects what a\nlady should be.\"\n\nBut her father was a doctor of medicine, she is the sister of the\nparish clergyman, she is only five feet two in height, and is so\nuncommonly brown! Had Lady Lufton dared to give a catalogue of her\nobjections, such would have been its extent and nature. But she did\nnot dare to do this.\n\n\"I cannot say, Ludovic, that she is possessed of all that you should\nseek in a wife.\" Such was her answer.\n\n\"Do you mean that she has not got money?\"\n\n\"No, not that; I should be very sorry to see you making money your\nchief object, or indeed any essential object. If it chanced that your\nwife did have money, no doubt you would find it a convenience. But\npray understand me, Ludovic; I would not for a moment advise you to\nsubject your happiness to such a necessity as that. It is not because\nshe is without fortune--\"\n\n\"Then why is it? At breakfast you were singing her praises, and\nsaying how excellent she is.\"\n\n\"If I were forced to put my objection into one word, I should say--\"\nand then she paused, hardly daring to encounter the frown which was\nalready gathering itself on her son's brow.\n\n\"You would say what?\" said Lord Lufton, almost roughly.\n\n\"Don't be angry with me, Ludovic; all that I think, and all that I\nsay on this subject, I think and say with only one object--that of\nyour happiness. What other motive can I have for anything in this\nworld?\" And then she came close to him and kissed him.\n\n\"But tell me, mother, what is this objection; what is this terrible\nword that is to sum up the list of all poor Lucy's sins, and prove\nthat she is unfit for married life?\"\n\n\"Ludovic, I did not say that. You know that I did not.\"\n\n\"What is the word, mother?\"\n\nAnd then at last Lady Lufton spoke it out. \"She is--insignificant. I\nbelieve her to be a very good girl, but she is not qualified to fill\nthe high position to which you would exalt her.\"\n\n\"Insignificant!\"\n\n\"Yes, Ludovic, I think so.\"\n\n\"Then, mother, you do not know her. You must permit me to say that\nyou are talking of a girl whom you do not know. Of all the epithets\nof opprobrium which the English language could give you, that would\nbe nearly the last which she would deserve.\"\n\n\"I have not intended any opprobrium.\"\n\n\"Insignificant!\"\n\n\"Perhaps you do not quite understand me, Ludovic.\"\n\n\"I know what insignificant means, mother.\"\n\n\"I think that she would not worthily fill the position which your\nwife should take in the world.\"\n\n\"I understand what you say.\"\n\n\"She would not do you honour at the head of your table.\"\n\n\"Ah, I understand. You want me to marry some bouncing Amazon, some\npink and white giantess of fashion who would frighten the little\npeople into their proprieties.\"\n\n\"Oh, Ludovic! you are intending to laugh at me now.\"\n\n\"I was never less inclined to laugh in my life--never, I can assure\nyou. And now I am more certain than ever that your objection to Miss\nRobarts arises from your not knowing her. You will find, I think,\nwhen you do know her, that she is as well able to hold her own as\nany lady of your acquaintance;--ay, and to maintain her husband's\nposition, too. I can assure you that I shall have no fear of her on\nthat score.\"\n\n\"I think, dearest, that perhaps you hardly--\"\n\n\"I think this, mother, that in such a matter as this I must choose\nfor myself. I have chosen; and I now ask you, as my mother, to go to\nher and bid her welcome. Dear mother, I will own this, that I should\nnot be happy if I thought that you did not love my wife.\" These last\nwords he said in a tone of affection that went to his mother's heart,\nand then he left the room.\n\nPoor Lady Lufton, when she was alone, waited till she heard her son's\nsteps retreating through the hall, and then betook herself up-stairs\nto her customary morning work. She sat down at last as though about\nso to occupy herself; but her mind was too full to allow of her\ntaking up her pen. She had often said to herself, in days which\nto her were not as yet long gone by, that she would choose a bride\nfor her son, and that then she would love the chosen one with all\nher heart. She would dethrone herself in favour of this new queen,\nsinking with joy into her dowager state, in order that her son's wife\nmight shine with the greater splendour. The fondest day-dreams of her\nlife had all had reference to the time when her son should bring home\na new Lady Lufton, selected by herself from the female excellence of\nEngland, and in which she might be the first to worship her new idol.\nBut could she dethrone herself for Lucy Robarts? Could she give up\nher chair of state in order to place thereon the little girl from\nthe parsonage? Could she take to her heart, and treat with absolute\nloving confidence, with the confidence of an almost idolatrous\nmother, that little chit who, a few months since, had sat awkwardly\nin one corner of her drawing-room, afraid to speak to any one? And\nyet it seemed that it must come to this--to this--or else those\nday-dreams of hers would in nowise come to pass.\n\nShe sat herself down, trying to think whether it were possible that\nLucy might fill the throne; for she had begun to recognize it as\nprobable that her son's will would be too strong for her; but her\nthoughts would fly away to Griselda Grantly. In her first and only\nmatured attempt to realize her day-dreams, she had chosen Griselda\nfor her queen. She had failed there, seeing that the fates had\ndestined Miss Grantly for another throne;--for another and a higher\none, as far as the world goes. She would have made Griselda the wife\nof a baron, but fate was about to make that young lady the wife of a\nmarquis. Was there cause of grief in this? Did she really regret that\nMiss Grantly, with all her virtues, should be made over to the house\nof Hartletop? Lady Lufton was a woman who did not bear disappointment\nlightly; but nevertheless she did almost feel herself to have been\nrelieved from a burden when she thought of the termination of the\nLufton-Grantly marriage treaty. What if she had been successful, and,\nafter all, the prize had been other than she had expected? She was\nsometimes prone to think that that prize was not exactly all that\nshe had once hoped. Griselda looked the very thing that Lady Lufton\nwanted for a queen;--but how would a queen reign who trusted only to\nher looks? In that respect it was perhaps well for her that destiny\nhad interposed. Griselda, she was driven to admit, was better suited\nto Lord Dumbello than to her son.\n\nBut still--such a queen as Lucy! Could it ever come to pass that the\nlieges of the kingdom would bow the knee in proper respect before so\npuny a sovereign? And then there was that feeling which, in still\nhigher quarters, prevents the marriage of princes with the most noble\nof their people. Is it not a recognized rule of these realms that\nnone of the blood royal shall raise to royal honours those of the\nsubjects who are by birth un-royal! Lucy was a subject of the house\nof Lufton in that she was the sister of the parson and a resident\ndenizen of the parsonage. Presuming that Lucy herself might do for\nqueen--granting that she might have some faculty to reign, the crown\nhaving been duly placed on her brow--how, then, about that clerical\nbrother near the throne? Would it not come to this, that there would\nno longer be a queen at Framley?\n\nAnd yet she knew that she must yield. She did not say so to herself.\nShe did not as yet acknowledge that she must put out her hand to\nLucy, calling her by name as her daughter. She did not absolutely say\nas much to her own heart;--not as yet. But she did begin to bethink\nherself of Lucy's high qualities, and to declare to herself that the\ngirl, if not fit to be a queen, was at any rate fit to be a woman.\nThat there was a spirit within that body, insignificant though the\nbody might be, Lady Lufton was prepared to admit. That she had\nacquired the power--the chief of all powers in this world--of\nsacrificing herself for the sake of others; that, too, was evident\nenough. That she was a good girl, in the usual acceptation of the\nword good, Lady Lufton had never doubted. She was ready-witted too,\nprompt in action, gifted with a certain fire. It was that gift of\nfire which had won for her, so unfortunately, Lord Lufton's love. It\nwas quite possible for her also to love Lucy Robarts; Lady Lufton\nadmitted that to herself;--but then who could bow the knee before\nher, and serve her as a queen? Was it not a pity that she should be\nso insignificant?\n\nBut, nevertheless, we may say that as Lady Lufton sate that morning\nin her own room for two hours without employment, the star of Lucy\nRobarts was gradually rising in the firmament. After all, love was\nthe food chiefly necessary for the nourishment of Lady Lufton,--the\nonly food absolutely necessary. She was not aware of this herself,\nnor probably would those who knew her best have so spoken of her.\nThey would have declared that family pride was her daily pabulum, and\nshe herself would have said so too, calling it, however, by some less\noffensive name. Her son's honour, and the honour of her house!--of\nthose she would have spoken as the things dearest to her in this\nworld. And this was partly true, for had her son been dishonoured,\nshe would have sunk with sorrow to the grave. But the one thing\nnecessary to her daily life was the power of loving those who were\nnear to her.\n\nLord Lufton, when he left the dining-room, intended at once to go up\nto the parsonage, but he first strolled round the garden in order\nthat he might make up his mind what he would say there. He was angry\nwith his mother, having not had the wit to see that she was about\nto give way and yield to him, and he was determined to make it\nunderstood that in this matter he would have his own way. He had\nlearned that which it was necessary that he should know as to Lucy's\nheart, and such being the case he would not conceive it possible that\nhe should be debarred by his mother's opposition. \"There is no son\nin England loves his mother better than I do,\" he said to himself;\n\"but there are some things which a man cannot stand. She would have\nmarried me to that block of stone if I would have let her; and now,\nbecause she is disappointed there-- Insignificant! I never in my life\nheard anything so absurd, so untrue, so uncharitable, so-- She'd like\nme to bring a dragon home, I suppose. It would serve her right if I\ndid,--some creature that would make the house intolerable to her.\"\n\"She must do it though,\" he said again, \"or she and I will quarrel,\"\nand then he turned off towards the gate, preparing to go to the\nparsonage.\n\n\"My lord, have you heard what has happened?\" said the gardener,\ncoming to him at the gate. The man was out of breath and almost\noverwhelmed by the greatness of his own tidings.\n\n\"No; I have heard nothing. What is it?\"\n\n\"The bailiffs have taken possession of everything at the parsonage.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV.\n\nTHE PHILISTINES AT THE PARSONAGE.\n\n\nIt has been already told how things went on between the Tozers, Mr.\nCurling, and Mark Robarts during that month. Mr. Forrest had drifted\nout of the business altogether, as also had Mr. Sowerby, as far as\nany active participation in it went. Letters came frequently from\nMr. Curling to the parsonage, and at last came a message by special\nmission to say that the evil day was at hand. As far as Mr. Curling's\nprofessional experience would enable him to anticipate or foretell\nthe proceedings of such a man as Tom Tozer, he thought that the\nsheriff's officers would be at Framley Parsonage on the following\nmorning. Mr. Curling's experience did not mislead him in this\nrespect.\n\n\"And what will you do, Mark?\" said Fanny, speaking through her tears,\nafter she had read the letter which her husband handed to her.\n\n\"Nothing. What can I do? They must come.\"\n\n\"Lord Lufton came to-day. Will you not go to him?\"\n\n\"No. If I were to do so it would be the same as asking him for the\nmoney.\"\n\n\"Why not borrow it of him, dearest? Surely it would not be so much\nfor him to lend.\"\n\n\"I could not do it. Think of Lucy, and how she stands with him.\nBesides I have already had words with Lufton about Sowerby and his\nmoney matters. He thinks that I am to blame, and he would tell me\nso; and then there would be sharp things said between us. He would\nadvance me the money if I pressed for it, but he would do so in a way\nthat would make it impossible that I should take it.\"\n\nThere was nothing more then to be said. If she had had her own way\nMrs. Robarts would have gone at once to Lady Lufton, but she could\nnot induce her husband to sanction such a proceeding. The objection\nto seeking assistance from her ladyship was as strong as that which\nprevailed as to her son. There had already been some little beginning\nof ill-feeling, and under such circumstances it was impossible to ask\nfor pecuniary assistance. Fanny, however, had a prophetic assurance\nthat assistance out of these difficulties must in the end come to\nthem from that quarter, or not come at all; and she would fain, had\nshe been allowed, make everything known at the big house.\n\nOn the following morning they breakfasted at the usual hour, but in\ngreat sadness. A maid-servant, whom Mrs. Robarts had brought with her\nwhen she married, told her that a rumour of what was to happen had\nreached the kitchen. Stubbs, the groom, had been in Barchester on the\npreceding day, and, according to his account--so said Mary--everybody\nin the city was talking about it. \"Never mind, Mary,\" said Mrs.\nRobarts, and Mary replied, \"Oh, no, of course not, ma'am.\"\n\nIn these days Mrs. Robarts was ordinarily very busy, seeing that\nthere were six children in the house, four of whom had come to her\nbut ill supplied with infantine belongings; and now, as usual, she\nwent about her work immediately after breakfast. But she moved about\nthe house very slowly, and was almost unable to give her orders\nto the servants, and spoke sadly to the children who hung about\nher wondering what was the matter. Her husband at the same time\ntook himself to his book-room, but when there did not attempt any\nemployment. He thrust his hands into his pockets, and, leaning\nagainst the fire-place, fixed his eyes upon the table before him\nwithout looking at anything that was on it; it was impossible for him\nto betake himself to his work. Remember what is the ordinary labour\nof a clergyman in his study, and think how fit he must have been for\nsuch employment! What would have been the nature of a sermon composed\nat such a moment, and with what satisfaction could he have used the\nsacred volume in referring to it for his arguments? He, in this\nrespect, was worse off than his wife; she did employ herself, but he\nstood there without moving, doing nothing, with fixed eyes, thinking\nwhat men would say of him.\n\nLuckily for him this state of suspense was not long, for within half\nan hour of his leaving the breakfast-table the footman knocked at his\ndoor--that footman with whom at the beginning of his difficulties he\nhad made up his mind to dispense, but who had been kept on because of\nthe Barchester prebend.\n\n\"If you please, your reverence, there are two men outside,\" said the\nfootman.\n\nTwo men! Mark knew well enough what men they were, but he could\nhardly take the coming of two such men to his quiet country parsonage\nquite as a matter of course.\n\n\"Who are they, John?\" said he, not wishing any answer, but because\nthe question was forced upon him.\n\n\"I'm afeard they're--bailiffs, sir.\"\n\n\"Very well, John; that will do; of course they must do what they\nplease about the place.\"\n\nAnd then, when the servant left him, he still stood without moving,\nexactly as he had stood before. There he remained for ten minutes,\nbut the time went by very slowly. When about noon some circumstance\ntold him what was the hour, he was astonished to find that the day\nhad not nearly passed away.\n\nAnd then another tap was struck on the door,--a sound which he well\nrecognized,--and his wife crept silently into the room. She came\nclose up to him before she spoke, and put her arm within his:\n\n\"Mark,\" she said, \"the men are here; they are in the yard.\"\n\n\n[Illustration: \"Mark,\" she said, \"the men are here.\"]\n\n\n\"I know it,\" he answered gruffly.\n\n\"Will it be better that you should see them, dearest?\"\n\n\"See them; no; what good can I do by seeing them? But I shall see\nthem soon enough; they will be here, I suppose, in a few minutes.\"\n\n\"They are taking an inventory, cook says; they are in the stable\nnow.\"\n\n\"Very well; they must do as they please; I cannot help them.\"\n\n\"Cook says that if they are allowed their meals and some beer, and if\nnobody takes anything away, they will be quite civil.\"\n\n\"Civil! But what does it matter? Let them eat and drink what they\nplease, as long as the food lasts. I don't suppose the butcher will\nsend you more.\"\n\n\"But, Mark, there's nothing due to the butcher,--only the regular\nmonthly bill.\"\n\n\"Very well; you'll see.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mark, don't look at me in that way. Do not turn away from me.\nWhat is to comfort us if we do not cling to each other now?\"\n\n\"Comfort us! God help you! I wonder, Fanny, that you can bear to stay\nin the room with me.\"\n\n\"Mark, dearest Mark, my own dear, dearest husband! who is to be true\nto you, if I am not? You shall not turn from me. How can anything\nlike this make a difference between you and me?\" And then she threw\nher arms round his neck and embraced him.\n\nIt was a terrible morning to him, and one of which every incident\nwill dwell on his memory to the last day of his life. He had been\nso proud in his position--had assumed to himself so prominent a\nstanding--had contrived, by some trick which he had acquired, to\ncarry his head so high above the heads of neighbouring parsons. It\nwas this that had taken him among great people, had introduced him to\nthe Duke of Omnium, had procured for him the stall at Barchester. But\nhow was he to carry his head now? What would the Arabins and Grantlys\nsay? How would the bishop sneer at him, and Mrs. Proudie and her\ndaughters tell of him in all their quarters? How would Crawley look\nat him--Crawley, who had already once had him on the hip? The stern\nseverity of Crawley's face loomed upon him now. Crawley, with his\nchildren half naked, and his wife a drudge, and himself half starved,\nhad never had a bailiff in his house at Hogglestock! And then his\nown curate, Evans, whom he had patronized, and treated almost as a\ndependant--how was he to look his curate in the face and arrange with\nhim for the sacred duties of the next Sunday?\n\nHis wife still stood by him, gazing into his face; and as he looked\nat her and thought of her misery, he could not control his heart\nwith reference to the wrongs which Sowerby had heaped on him. It was\nSowerby's falsehood and Sowerby's fraud which had brought upon him\nand his wife this terrible anguish. \"If there be justice on earth he\nwill suffer for it yet,\" he said at last, not speaking intentionally\nto his wife, but unable to repress his feelings.\n\n\"Do not wish him evil, Mark; you may be sure he has his own sorrows.\"\n\n\"His own sorrows! No; he is callous to such misery as this. He has\nbecome so hardened in dishonesty that all this is mirth to him. If\nthere be punishment in heaven for falsehood--\"\n\n\"Oh, Mark, do not curse him!\"\n\n\"How am I to keep myself from cursing when I see what he has brought\nupon you?\"\n\n\"'Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord,'\" answered the young wife, not\nwith solemn, preaching accent, as though bent on reproof, but with\nthe softest whisper into his ear. \"Leave that to Him, Mark; and for\nus, let us pray that He may soften the hearts of us all;--of him who\nhas caused us to suffer, and of our own.\"\n\nMark was not called upon to reply to this, for he was again disturbed\nby a servant at the door. It was the cook this time herself, who had\ncome with a message from the men of the law. And she had come, be it\nremembered, not from any necessity that she as cook should do this\nline of work; for the footman, or Mrs. Robarts' maid, might have\ncome as well as she. But when things are out of course servants are\nalways out of course also. As a rule, nothing will induce a butler\nto go into a stable, or persuade a housemaid to put her hand to\na frying-pan. But now that this new excitement had come upon the\nhousehold--seeing that the bailiffs were in possession, and that the\nchattels were being entered in a catalogue, everybody was willing to\ndo everything--everything but his or her own work. The gardener was\nlooking after the dear children; the nurse was doing the rooms before\nthe bailiffs should reach them; the groom had gone into the kitchen\nto get their lunch ready for them; and the cook was walking about\nwith an inkstand, obeying all the orders of these great potentates.\nAs far as the servants were concerned, it may be a question whether\nthe coming of the bailiffs had not hitherto been regarded as a treat.\n\n\"If you please, ma'am,\" said Jemima cook, \"they wishes to know in\nwhich room you'd be pleased to have the inmin-tory took fust. 'Cause,\nma'am, they wouldn't disturb you nor master more than can be avoided.\nFor their line of life, ma'am, they is very civil--very civil\nindeed.\"\n\n\"I suppose they may go into the drawing-room,\" said Mrs. Robarts, in\na sad low voice. All nice women are proud of their drawing-rooms, and\nshe was very proud of hers. It had been furnished when money was\nplenty with them, immediately after their marriage, and everything\nin it was pretty, good, and dear to her. O ladies, who have\ndrawing-rooms in which the things are pretty, good, and dear to you,\nthink of what it would be to have two bailiffs rummaging among them\nwith pen and inkhorn, making a catalogue preparatory to a sheriff's\nauction; and all without fault or extravagance of your own! There\nwere things there that had been given to her by Lady Lufton, by Lady\nMeredith, and other friends, and the idea did occur to her that it\nmight be possible to save them from contamination; but she would not\nsay a word, lest by so saying she might add to Mark's misery.\n\n\"And then the dining-room,\" said Jemima cook, in a tone almost of\nelation.\n\n\"Yes; if they please.\"\n\n\"And then master's book-room here; or perhaps the bedrooms, if you\nand master be still here.\"\n\n\"Any way they please, cook; it does not much signify,\" said Mrs.\nRobarts. But for some days after that Jemima was by no means a\nfavourite with her.\n\nThe cook was hardly out of the room before a quick footstep was heard\non the gravel before the window, and the hall door was immediately\nopened.\n\n\"Where is your master?\" said the well-known voice of Lord Lufton; and\nthen in half a minute he also was in the book-room.\n\n\"Mark, my dear fellow, what's all this?\" said he, in a cheery tone\nand with a pleasant face. \"Did not you know that I was here? I came\ndown yesterday; landed from Hamburg only yesterday morning. How do\nyou do, Mrs. Robarts? This is a terrible bore, isn't it?\"\n\nRobarts, at the first moment, hardly knew how to speak to his old\nfriend. He was struck dumb by the disgrace of his position; the more\nso as his misfortune was one which it was partly in the power of Lord\nLufton to remedy. He had never yet borrowed money since he had filled\na man's position, but he had had words about money with the young\npeer, in which he knew that his friend had wronged him; and for this\ndouble reason he was now speechless.\n\n\"Mr. Sowerby has betrayed him,\" said Mrs. Robarts, wiping the tears\nfrom her eyes. Hitherto she had said no word against Sowerby, but now\nit was necessary to defend her husband.\n\n\"No doubt about it. I believe he has always betrayed every one who\nhas ever trusted him. I told you what he was, some time since; did I\nnot? But, Mark, why on earth have you let it go so far as this? Would\nnot Forrest help you?\"\n\n\"Mr. Forrest wanted him to sign more bills, and he would not do\nthat,\" said Mrs. Robarts, sobbing.\n\n\"Bills are like dram-drinking,\" said the discreet young lord: \"when\none once begins, it is very hard to leave off. Is it true that the\nmen are here now, Mark?\"\n\n\"Yes, they are in the next room.\"\n\n\"What, in the drawing-room?\"\n\n\"They are making out a list of the things,\" said Mrs. Robarts.\n\n\"We must stop that at any rate,\" said his lordship, walking off\ntowards the scene of the operations; and as he left the room Mrs.\nRobarts followed him, leaving her husband by himself.\n\n\"Why did you not send down to my mother?\" said he, speaking hardly\nabove a whisper, as they stood together in the hall.\n\n\"He would not let me.\"\n\n\"But why not go yourself? or why not have written to me,--considering\nhow intimate we are?\"\n\nMrs. Robarts could not explain to him that the peculiar intimacy\nbetween him and Lucy must have hindered her from doing so, even if\notherwise it might have been possible; but she felt such was the\ncase.\n\n\"Well, my men, this is bad work you're doing here,\" said he, walking\ninto the drawing-room. Whereupon the cook curtseyed low, and the\nbailiffs, knowing his lordship, stopped from their business and\nput their hands to their foreheads. \"You must stop this, if you\nplease,--at once. Come, let's go out into the kitchen, or some place\noutside. I don't like to see you here with your big boots and the pen\nand ink among the furniture.\"\n\n\"We ain't a-done no harm, my lord, so please your lordship,\" said\nJemima cook.\n\n\"And we is only a-doing our bounden dooties,\" said one of the\nbailiffs.\n\n\"As we is sworn to do, so please your lordship,\" said the other.\n\n\"And is wery sorry to be unconwenient, my lord, to any gen'leman or\nlady as is a gen'leman or lady. But accidents will happen, and then\nwhat can the likes of us do?\" said the first.\n\n\"Because we is sworn, my lord,\" said the second. But, nevertheless,\nin spite of their oaths, and in spite also of the stern necessity\nwhich they pleaded, they ceased their operations at the instance of\nthe peer. For the name of a lord is still great in England.\n\n\"And now leave this, and let Mrs. Robarts go into her drawing-room.\"\n\n\"And, please your lordship, what is we to do? Who is we to look to?\"\n\nIn satisfying them absolutely on this point Lord Lufton had to\nuse more than his influence as a peer. It was necessary that he\nshould have pen and paper. But with pen and paper he did satisfy\nthem;--satisfy them so far that they agreed to return to Stubbs'\nroom, the former hospital, due stipulation having been made for the\nmeals and beer, and there await the order to evacuate the premises\nwhich would no doubt, under his lordship's influence, reach them on\nthe following day. The meaning of all which was that Lord Lufton had\nundertaken to bear upon his own shoulder the whole debt due by Mr.\nRobarts.\n\nAnd then he returned to the book-room where Mark was still standing\nalmost on the spot in which he had placed himself immediately after\nbreakfast. Mrs. Robarts did not return, but went up among the\nchildren to counter-order such directions as she had given for the\npreparation of the nursery for the Philistines. \"Mark,\" he said,\n\"do not trouble yourself about this more than you can help. The men\nhave ceased doing anything, and they shall leave the place to-morrow\nmorning.\"\n\n\"And how will the money--be paid?\" said the poor clergyman.\n\n\"Do not bother yourself about that at present. It shall so be managed\nthat the burden shall fall ultimately on yourself--not on any one\nelse. But I am sure it must be a comfort to you to know that your\nwife need not be driven out of her drawing-room.\"\n\n\"But, Lufton, I cannot allow you--after what has passed--and at the\npresent moment--\"\n\n\"My dear fellow, I know all about it, and I am coming to that just\nnow. You have employed Curling, and he shall settle it; and upon my\nword, Mark, you shall pay the bill. But, for the present emergency,\nthe money is at my banker's.\"\n\n\"But, Lufton--\"\n\n\"And to deal honestly, about Curling's bill I mean, it ought to be as\nmuch my affair as your own. It was I that brought you into this mess\nwith Sowerby, and I know now how unjust about it I was to you up in\nLondon. But the truth is that Sowerby's treachery had nearly driven\nme wild. It has done the same to you since, I have no doubt.\"\n\n\"He has ruined me,\" said Robarts.\n\n\"No, he has not done that. No thanks to him though; he would not have\nscrupled to do it had it come in his way. The fact is, Mark, that you\nand I cannot conceive the depth of fraud in such a man as that. He\nis always looking for money; I believe that in all his hours of most\nfriendly intercourse,--when he is sitting with you over your wine,\nand riding beside you in the field,--he is still thinking how he can\nmake use of you to tide him over some difficulty. He has lived in\nthat way till he has a pleasure in cheating, and has become so clever\nin his line of life that if you or I were with him again to-morrow he\nwould again get the better of us. He is a man that must be absolutely\navoided; I, at any rate, have learned to know so much.\"\n\nIn the expression of which opinion Lord Lufton was too hard upon\npoor Sowerby; as indeed we are all apt to be too hard in forming an\nopinion upon the rogues of the world. That Mr. Sowerby had been a\nrogue, I cannot deny. It is roguish to lie, and he had been a great\nliar. It is roguish to make promises which the promiser knows he\ncannot perform, and such had been Mr. Sowerby's daily practice. It\nis roguish to live on other men's money, and Mr. Sowerby had long\nbeen doing so. It is roguish, at least so I would hold it, to deal\nwillingly with rogues; and Mr. Sowerby had been constant in such\ndealings. I do not know whether he had not at times fallen even into\nmore palpable roguery than is proved by such practices as those\nenumerated. Though I have for him some tender feeling, knowing that\nthere was still a touch of gentle bearing round his heart, an abiding\ntaste for better things within him, I cannot acquit him from the\ngreat accusation. But, for all that, in spite of his acknowledged\nroguery, Lord Lufton was too hard upon him in his judgment. There was\nyet within him the means of repentance, could a _locus penitenti\u00c3\u00a6_\nhave been supplied to him. He grieved bitterly over his own ill\ndoings, and knew well what changes gentlehood would have demanded\nfrom him. Whether or no he had gone too far for all changes--whether\nthe _locus penitenti\u00c3\u00a6_ was for him still a possibility--that was\nbetween him and a higher power.\n\n\"I have no one to blame but myself,\" said Mark, still speaking in the\nsame heart-broken tone and with his face averted from his friend.\n\nThe debt would now be paid, and the bailiffs would be expelled; but\nthat would not set him right before the world. It would be known to\nall men--to all clergymen in the diocese--that the sheriff's officers\nhad been in charge of Framley Parsonage, and he could never again\nhold up his head in the close of Barchester.\n\n\"My dear fellow, if we were all to make ourselves miserable for such\na trifle as this--\" said Lord Lufton, putting his arm affectionately\non his friend's shoulder.\n\n\"But we are not all clergymen,\" said Mark, and as he spoke he turned\naway to the window and Lord Lufton knew that the tears were on his\ncheek.\n\nNothing was then said between them for some moments, after which Lord\nLufton again spoke,--\n\n\"Mark, my dear fellow!\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Mark, with his face still turned towards the window.\n\n\"You must remember one thing; in helping you over this stile, which\nwill be really a matter of no inconvenience to me, I have a better\nright than that even of an old friend; I look upon you now as my\nbrother-in-law.\"\n\nMark turned slowly round, plainly showing the tears upon his face.\n\n\"Do you mean,\" said he, \"that anything more has taken place?\"\n\n\"I mean to make your sister my wife; she sent me word by you to say\nthat she loved me, and I am not going to stand upon any nonsense\nafter that. If she and I are both willing no one alive has a right to\nstand between us; and, by heavens, no one shall. I will do nothing\nsecretly, so I tell you that, exactly as I have told her ladyship.\"\n\n\"But what does she say?\"\n\n\"She says nothing; but it cannot go on like that. My mother and I\ncannot live here together if she opposes me in this way. I do not\nwant to frighten your sister by going over to her at Hogglestock, but\nI expect you to tell her so much as I now tell you, as coming from\nme; otherwise she will think that I have forgotten her.\"\n\n\"She will not think that.\"\n\n\"She need not; good-bye, old fellow. I'll make it all right between\nyou and her ladyship about this affair of Sowerby's.\"\n\nAnd then he took his leave and walked off to settle about the payment\nof the money.\n\n\"Mother,\" said he to Lady Lufton that evening, \"you must not bring\nthis affair of the bailiffs up against Robarts. It has been more my\nfault than his.\"\n\nHitherto not a word had been spoken between Lady Lufton and her\nson on the subject. She had heard with terrible dismay of what had\nhappened, and had heard also that Lord Lufton had immediately gone\nto the parsonage. It was impossible, therefore, that she should now\ninterfere. That the necessary money would be forthcoming she was\naware, but that would not wipe out the terrible disgrace attached\nto an execution in a clergyman's house. And then, too, he was\nher clergyman,--her own clergyman, selected, and appointed, and\nbrought to Framley by herself, endowed with a wife of her own\nchoosing, filled with good things by her own hand! It was a terrible\nmisadventure, and she began to repent that she had ever heard the\nname of Robarts. She would not, however, have been slow to put forth\nthe hand to lessen the evil by giving her own money, had this been\neither necessary or possible. But how could she interfere between\nRobarts and her son, especially when she remembered the proposed\nconnection between Lucy and Lord Lufton?\n\n\"Your fault, Ludovic?\"\n\n\"Yes, mother. It was I who introduced him to Mr. Sowerby; and, to\ntell the truth, I do not think he would ever have been intimate\nwith Sowerby if I had not given him some sort of a commission with\nreference to money matters then pending between Mr. Sowerby and me.\nThey are all over now,--thanks to you, indeed.\"\n\n\"Mr. Robarts' character as a clergyman should have kept him from such\ntroubles, if no other feeling did so.\"\n\n\"At any rate, mother, oblige me by letting it pass by.\"\n\n\"Oh, I shall say nothing to him.\"\n\n\"You had better say something to her, or otherwise it will be\nstrange; and even to him I would say a word or two,--a word in\nkindness, as you so well know how. It will be easier to him in that\nway, than if you were to be altogether silent.\"\n\nNo further conversation took place between them at the time, but\nlater in the evening she brushed her hand across her son's forehead,\nsweeping the long silken hairs into their place, as she was wont to\ndo when moved by any special feeling of love. \"Ludovic,\" she said,\n\"no one, I think, has so good a heart as you. I will do exactly as\nyou would have me about this affair of Mr. Robarts and the money.\"\nAnd then there was nothing more said about it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLV.\n\nPALACE BLESSINGS.\n\n\nAnd now, at this period, terrible rumours found their way into\nBarchester, and flew about the cathedral towers and round the\ncathedral door; ay, and into the canons' houses and the humbler\nsitting-rooms of the vicars choral. Whether they made their way from\nthence up to the bishop's palace, or whether they descended from\nthe palace to the close, I will not pretend to say. But they were\nshocking, unnatural, and no doubt grievous to all those excellent\necclesiastical hearts which cluster so thickly in those quarters.\n\nThe first of these had reference to the new prebendary, and to the\ndisgrace which he had brought on the chapter; a disgrace, as some of\nthem boasted, which Barchester had never known before. This, however,\nlike most other boasts, was hardly true; for within but a very few\nyears there had been an execution in the house of a late prebendary,\nold Dr. Stanhope; and on that occasion the doctor himself had been\nforced to fly away to Italy, starting in the night, lest he also\nshould fall into the hands of the Philistines, as well as his chairs\nand tables.\n\n\"It is a scandalous shame,\" said Mrs. Proudie, speaking not of the\nold doctor, but of the new offender; \"a scandalous shame: and it\nwould only serve him right if the gown were stripped from his back.\"\n\n\"I suppose his living will be sequestrated,\" said a young minor canon\nwho attended much to the ecclesiastical injunctions of the lady of\nthe diocese, and was deservedly held in high favour. If Framley were\nsequestrated, why should not he, as well as another, undertake the\nduty--with such stipend as the bishop might award?\n\n\"I am told that he is over head and ears in debt,\" said the future\nMrs. Tickler, \"and chiefly for horses which he has bought and not\npaid for.\"\n\n\"I see him riding very splendid animals when he comes over for the\ncathedral duties,\" said the minor canon.\n\n\"The sheriff's officers are in the house at present, I am told,\" said\nMrs. Proudie.\n\n\"And is not he in jail?\" said Mrs. Tickler.\n\n\"If not, he ought to be,\" said Mrs. Tickler's mother.\n\n\"And no doubt soon will be,\" said the minor canon; \"for I hear that\nhe is linked up with a most discreditable gang of persons.\"\n\nThis was what was said in the palace on that heading; and though,\nno doubt, more spirit and poetry was displayed there than in the\nhouses of the less gifted clergy, this shows the manner in which the\nmisfortune of Mr. Robarts was generally discussed. Nor, indeed, had\nhe deserved any better treatment at their hands. But his name did\nnot run the gauntlet for the usual nine days; nor, indeed, did his\nfame endure at its height for more than two. This sudden fall was\noccasioned by other tidings of a still more distressing nature; by\na rumour which so affected Mrs. Proudie that it caused, as she said,\nher blood to creep. And she was very careful that the blood of others\nshould creep also, if the blood of others was equally sensitive. It\nwas said that Lord Dumbello had jilted Miss Grantly.\n\nFrom what adverse spot in the world these cruel tidings fell upon\nBarchester I have never been able to discover. We know how quickly\nrumour flies, making herself common through all the cities. That\nMrs. Proudie should have known more of the facts connected with the\nHartletop family than any one else in Barchester was not surprising,\nseeing that she was so much more conversant with the great world in\nwhich such people lived. She knew, and was therefore correct enough\nin declaring, that Lord Dumbello had already jilted one other young\nlady--the Lady Julia Mac Mull, to whom he had been engaged three\nseasons back, and that therefore his character in such matters was\nnot to be trusted. That Lady Julia had been a terrible flirt and\ngreatly given to waltzing with a certain German count, with whom\nshe had since gone off--that, I suppose, Mrs. Proudie did not know,\nmuch as she was conversant with the great world,--seeing that she\nsaid nothing about it to any of her ecclesiastical listeners on the\npresent occasion.\n\n\"It will be a terrible warning, Mrs. Quiverful, to us all; a most\nuseful warning to us--not to trust to the things of this world.\nI fear they made no inquiry about this young nobleman before they\nagreed that his name should be linked with that of their daughter.\"\nThis she said to the wife of the present warden of Hiram's Hospital,\na lady who had received favours from her, and was therefore bound to\nlisten attentively to her voice.\n\n\"But I hope it may not be true,\" said Mrs. Quiverful, who, in spite\nof the allegiance due by her to Mrs. Proudie, had reasons of her own\nfor wishing well to the Grantly family.\n\n\"I hope so, indeed,\" said Mrs. Proudie, with a slight tinge of anger\nin her voice; \"but I fear that there is no doubt. And I must confess\nthat it is no more than we had a right to expect. I hope that it may\nbe taken by all of us as a lesson, and an ensample, and a teaching\nof the Lord's mercy. And I wish you would request your husband--from\nme, Mrs. Quiverful--to dwell on this subject in morning and evening\nlecture at the hospital on Sabbath next, showing how false is the\ntrust which we put in the good things of this world;\" which behest,\nto a certain extent, Mr. Quiverful did obey, feeling that a quiet\nlife in Barchester was of great value to him; but he did not go so\nfar as to caution his hearers, who consisted of the aged bedesmen of\nthe hospital, against matrimonial projects of an ambitious nature.\n\nIn this case, as in all others of the kind, the report was known to\nall the chapter before it had been heard by the archdeacon or his\nwife. The dean heard it, and disregarded it; as did also the dean's\nwife--at first; and those who generally sided with the Grantlys in\nthe diocesan battles pooh-poohed the tidings, saying to each other\nthat both the archdeacon and Mrs. Grantly were very well able to take\ncare of their own affairs. But dripping water hollows a stone; and at\nlast it was admitted on all sides that there was ground for fear,--on\nall sides, except at Plumstead.\n\n\"I am sure there is nothing in it; I really am sure of it,\" said Mrs.\nArabin, whispering to her sister; \"but after turning it over in my\nmind, I thought it right to tell you. And yet I don't know now but I\nam wrong.\"\n\n\"Quite right, dearest Eleanor,\" said Mrs. Grantly. \"And I am much\nobliged to you. But we understand it, you know. It comes, of course,\nlike all other Christian blessings, from the palace.\" And then there\nwas nothing more said about it between Mrs. Grantly and her sister.\n\nBut on the following morning there arrived a letter by post,\naddressed to Mrs. Grantly, bearing the postmark of Littlebath. The\nletter ran:--\n\n\n   MADAM,\n\n   It is known to the writer that Lord Dumbello has arranged\n   with certain friends how he may escape from his present\n   engagement. I think, therefore, that it is my duty as a\n   Christian to warn you of this.\n\n   Yours truly,\n\n   A WELLWISHER.\n\n\nNow it had happened that the embryo Mrs. Tickler's most intimate\nbosom friend and confidante was known at Plumstead to live at\nLittlebath, and it had also happened--most unfortunately--that\nthe embryo Mrs. Tickler, in the warmth of her neighbourly regard,\nhad written a friendly line to her friend Griselda Grantly,\ncongratulating her with all female sincerity on her splendid nuptials\nwith the Lord Dumbello.\n\n\"It is not her natural hand,\" said Mrs. Grantly, talking the matter\nover with her husband, \"but you may be sure it has come from her. It\nis a part of the new Christianity which we learn day by day from the\npalace teaching.\"\n\nBut these things had some effect on the archdeacon's mind. He had\nlearned lately the story of Lady Julia Mac Mull, and was not sure\nthat his son-in-law--as ought to be about to be--had been entirely\nblameless in that matter. And then in these days Lord Dumbello made\nno great sign. Immediately on Griselda's return to Plumstead he had\nsent her a magnificent present of emeralds, which, however, had come\nto her direct from the jewellers, and might have been--and probably\nwas--ordered by his man of business. Since that he had neither come,\nnor sent, nor written. Griselda did not seem to be in any way annoyed\nby this absence of the usual sign of love, and went on steadily\nwith her great duties. \"Nothing,\" as she told her mother, \"had been\nsaid about writing, and, therefore, she did not expect it.\" But the\narchdeacon was not quite at his ease. \"Keep Dumbello up to his P's\nand Q's, you know,\" a friend of his had whispered to him at his\nclub. By heavens, yes. The archdeacon was not a man to bear with\nindifference a wrong in such a quarter. In spite of his clerical\nprofession, few men were more inclined to fight against personal\nwrongs--and few men more able.\n\n\"Can there be anything wrong, I wonder?\" said he to his wife. \"Is\nit worth while that I should go up to London?\" But Mrs. Grantly\nattributed it all to the palace doctrine. What could be more natural,\nlooking at all the circumstances of the Tickler engagement? She\ntherefore gave her voice against any steps being taken by the\narchdeacon.\n\nA day or two after that Mrs. Proudie met Mrs. Arabin in the close\nand condoled with her openly on the termination of the marriage\ntreaty;--quite openly, for Mrs. Tickler--as she was to be--was with\nher mother, and Mrs. Arabin was accompanied by her sister-in-law,\nMary Bold.\n\n\"It must be very grievous to Mrs. Grantly, very grievous indeed,\"\nsaid Mrs. Proudie, \"and I sincerely feel for her. But, Mrs. Arabin,\nall these lessons are sent to us for our eternal welfare.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Mrs. Arabin. \"But as to this special lesson, I am\ninclined to doubt that it--\"\n\n\"Ah-h! I fear it is too true. I fear there is no room for doubt. Of\ncourse you are aware that Lord Dumbello is off for the Continent.\"\n\nMrs. Arabin was not aware of it, and she was obliged to admit as\nmuch.\n\n\"He started four days ago, by way of Boulogne,\" said Mrs. Tickler,\nwho seemed to be very well up in the whole affair. \"I am so sorry for\npoor dear Griselda. I am told she has got all her things. It is such\na pity, you know.\"\n\n\"But why should not Lord Dumbello come back from the Continent?\" said\nMiss Bold, very quietly.\n\n\"Why not, indeed? I'm sure I hope he may,\" said Mrs. Proudie. \"And no\ndoubt he will, some day. But if he be such a man as they say he is,\nit is really well for Griselda that she should be relieved from such\na marriage. For, after all, Mrs. Arabin, what are the things of this\nworld?--dust beneath our feet, ashes between our teeth, grass cut for\nthe oven, vanity, vexation, and nothing more!\"--well pleased with\nwhich variety of Christian metaphors Mrs. Proudie walked on, still\nmuttering, however, something about worms and grubs, by which she\nintended to signify her own species and the Dumbello and Grantly\nsects of it in particular.\n\nThis now had gone so far that Mrs. Arabin conceived herself bound in\nduty to see her sister, and it was then settled in consultation at\nPlumstead that the archdeacon should call officially at the palace\nand beg that the rumour might be contradicted. This he did early on\nthe next morning and was shown into the bishop's study, in which he\nfound both his lordship and Mrs. Proudie. The bishop rose to greet\nhim with special civility, smiling his very sweetest on him, as\nthough of all his clergy the archdeacon were the favourite; but Mrs.\nProudie wore something of a gloomy aspect, as though she knew that\nsuch a visit at such an hour must have reference to some special\nbusiness. The morning calls made by the archdeacon at the palace in\nthe way of ordinary civility were not numerous.\n\nOn the present occasion he dashed at once into his subject. \"I have\ncalled this morning, Mrs. Proudie,\" said he, \"because I wish to ask\na favour from you.\" Whereupon Mrs. Proudie bowed.\n\n\"Mrs. Proudie will be most happy, I am sure,\" said the bishop.\n\n\"I find that some foolish people have been talking in Barchester\nabout my daughter,\" said the archdeacon; \"and I wish to ask Mrs.\nProudie--\"\n\nMost women under such circumstances would have felt the awkwardness\nof their situation, and would have prepared to eat their past\nwords with wry faces. But not so Mrs. Proudie. Mrs. Grantly had had\nthe imprudence to throw Mr. Slope in her face--there, in her own\ndrawing-room, and she was resolved to be revenged. Mrs. Grantly, too,\nhad ridiculed the Tickler match, and no too great niceness should now\nprevent Mrs. Proudie from speaking her mind about the Dumbello match.\n\n\"A great many people are talking about her, I am sorry to say,\" said\nMrs. Proudie; \"but, poor dear, it is not her fault. It might have\nhappened to any girl; only, perhaps, a little more care--; you'll\nexcuse me, Dr. Grantly.\"\n\n\"I have come here to allude to a report which has been spread about\nin Barchester, that the match between Lord Dumbello and my daughter\nhas been broken off; and--\"\n\n\"Everybody in Barchester knows it, I believe,\" said Mrs. Proudie.\n\n--\"and,\" continued the archdeacon, \"to request that that report may\nbe contradicted.\"\n\n\"Contradicted! Why, he has gone right away,--out of the country!\"\n\n\"Never mind where he has gone to, Mrs. Proudie; I beg that the report\nmay be contradicted.\"\n\n\"You'll have to go round to every house in Barchester then,\" said\nshe.\n\n\"By no means,\" replied the archdeacon. \"And perhaps it may be right\nthat I should explain to the bishop that I came here because--\"\n\n\"The bishop knows nothing about it,\" said Mrs. Proudie.\n\n\"Nothing in the world,\" said his lordship. \"And I am sure I hope that\nthe young lady may not be disappointed.\"\n\n--\"because the matter was so distinctly mentioned to Mrs. Arabin by\nyourself yesterday.\"\n\n\"Distinctly mentioned! Of course it was distinctly mentioned. There\nare some things which can't be kept under a bushel, Dr. Grantly; and\nthis seems to be one of them. Your going about in this way won't make\nLord Dumbello marry the young lady.\"\n\nThat was true; nor would it make Mrs. Proudie hold her tongue.\nPerhaps the archdeacon was wrong in his present errand, and so he now\nbegan to bethink himself. \"At any rate,\" said he, \"when I tell you\nthat there is no ground whatever for such a report you will do me the\nkindness to say that, as far as you are concerned, it shall go no\nfurther. I think, my lord, I am not asking too much in asking that.\"\n\n\"The bishop knows nothing about it,\" said Mrs. Proudie again.\n\n\"Nothing at all,\" said the bishop.\n\n\"And as I must protest that I believe the information which has\nreached me on this head,\" said Mrs. Proudie, \"I do not see how it is\npossible that I should contradict it. I can easily understand your\nfeelings, Dr. Grantly. Considering your daughter's position the match\nwas, as regards earthly wealth, a very great one. I do not wonder\nthat you should be grieved at its being broken off; but I trust that\nthis sorrow may eventuate in a blessing to you and to Miss Griselda.\nThese worldly disappointments are precious balms, and I trust you\nknow how to accept them as such.\"\n\nThe fact was that Dr. Grantly had done altogether wrong in coming to\nthe palace. His wife might have some chance with Mrs. Proudie, but\nhe had none. Since she had come to Barchester he had had only two or\nthree encounters with her, and in all of these he had gone to the\nwall. His visits to the palace always resulted in his leaving the\npresence of the inhabitants in a frame of mind by no means desirable,\nand he now found that he had to do so once again. He could not\ncompel Mrs. Proudie to say that the report was untrue; nor could he\ncondescend to make counter hits at her about her own daughter, as his\nwife would have done. And thus, having utterly failed, he got up and\ntook his leave.\n\nBut the worst of the matter was, that, in going home, he could not\ndivest his mind of the idea that there might be some truth in the\nreport. What if Lord Dumbello had gone to the Continent resolved\nto send back from thence some reason why it was impossible that he\nshould make Miss Grantly his wife? Such things had been done before\nnow by men in his rank. Whether or no Mrs. Tickler had been the\nletter-writing wellwisher from Littlebath, or had induced her friend\nto be so, it did seem manifest to him, Dr. Grantly, that Mrs. Proudie\nabsolutely believed the report which she promulgated so diligently.\nThe wish might be father to the thought, no doubt; but that the\nthought was truly there, Dr. Grantly could not induce himself to\ndisbelieve.\n\nHis wife was less credulous, and to a certain degree comforted him;\nbut that evening he received a letter which greatly confirmed the\nsuspicions set on foot by Mrs. Proudie, and even shook his wife's\nfaith in Lord Dumbello. It was from a mere acquaintance, who in the\nordinary course of things would not have written to him. And the bulk\nof the letter referred to ordinary things, as to which the gentleman\nin question would hardly have thought of giving himself the trouble\nto write a letter. But at the end of the note he said,--\n\n\"Of course you are aware that Dumbello is off to Paris; I have not\nheard whether the exact day of his return is fixed.\"\n\n\"It is true then,\" said the archdeacon, striking the library table\nwith his hand, and becoming absolutely white about the mouth and\njaws.\n\n\"It cannot be,\" said Mrs. Grantly; but even she was now trembling.\n\n\"If it be so I'll drag him back to England by the collar of his coat,\nand disgrace him before the steps of his father's hall.\"\n\nAnd the archdeacon as he uttered the threat looked his character as\nan irate British father much better than he did his other character\nas a clergyman of the Church of England. The archdeacon had been\ngreatly worsted by Mrs. Proudie, but he was a man who knew how to\nfight his battles among men,--sometimes without too close a regard to\nhis cloth.\n\n\"Had Lord Dumbello intended any such thing he would have written, or\ngot some friend to write by this time,\" said Mrs. Grantly. \"It is\nquite possible that he might wish to be off, but he would be too\nchary of his name not to endeavour to do so with decency.\"\n\nThus the matter was discussed, and it appeared to them both to be so\nserious that the archdeacon resolved to go at once to London. That\nLord Dumbello had gone to France he did not doubt; but he would find\nsome one in town acquainted with the young man's intentions, and\nhe would, no doubt, be able to hear when his return was expected.\nIf there were real reason for apprehension he would follow the\nrunagate to the Continent, but he would not do this without absolute\nknowledge. According to Lord Dumbello's present engagements he was\nbound to present himself in August next at Plumstead Episcopi, with\nthe view of then and there taking Griselda Grantly in marriage;\nbut if he kept his word in this respect no one had a right to\nquarrel with him for going to Paris in the meantime. Most expectant\nbridegrooms would, no doubt, under such circumstances have declared\ntheir intentions to their future brides; but if Lord Dumbello\nwere different from others, who had a right on that account to be\nindignant with him? He was unlike other men in other things; and\nespecially unlike other men in being the eldest son of the Marquis\nof Hartletop. It would be all very well for Tickler to proclaim his\nwhereabouts from week to week; but the eldest son of a marquis might\nfind it inconvenient to be so precise! Nevertheless the archdeacon\nthought it only prudent to go up to London.\n\n\"Susan,\" said the archdeacon to his wife, just as he was\nstarting;--at this moment neither of them were in the happiest\nspirits,--\"I think I would say a word of caution to Griselda.\"\n\n\"Do you feel so much doubt about it as that?\" said Mrs. Grantly. But\neven she did not dare to put a direct negative to this proposal, so\nmuch had she been moved by what she had heard!\n\n\"I think I would do so, not frightening her more than I could help.\nIt will lessen the blow if it be that the blow is to fall.\"\n\n\"It will kill me,\" said Mrs. Grantly; \"but I think that she will be\nable to bear it.\"\n\nOn the next morning Mrs. Grantly, with much cunning preparation, went\nabout the task which her husband had left her to perform. It took her\nlong to do, for she was very cunning in the doing of it; but at last\nit dropped from her in words that there was a possibility--a bare\npossibility--that some disappointment might even yet be in store for\nthem.\n\n\"Do you mean, mamma, that the marriage will be put off?\"\n\n\"I don't mean to say that I think it will; God forbid! but it is just\npossible. I daresay that I am very wrong to tell you of this, but I\nknow that you have sense enough to bear it. Papa has gone to London\nand we shall hear from him soon.\"\n\n\"Then, mamma, I had better give them orders not to go on with the\nmarking.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVI.\n\nLADY LUFTON'S REQUEST.\n\n\nThe bailiffs on that day had their meals regular,--and their beer,\nwhich state of things, together with an absence of all duty in the\nway of making inventories and the like, I take to be the earthly\nparadise of bailiffs; and on the next morning they walked off with\ncivil speeches and many apologies as to their intrusion. \"They was\nvery sorry,\" they said, \"to have troubled a gen'leman as were a\ngen'leman, but in their way of business what could they do?\" To\nwhich one of them added a remark that, \"business is business.\" This\nstatement I am not prepared to contradict, but I would recommend\nall men in choosing a profession to avoid any that may require an\napology at every turn;--either an apology or else a somewhat violent\nassertion of right. Each younger male reader may perhaps reply that\nhe has no thought of becoming a sheriff's officer; but then are there\nnot other cognate lines of life to which perhaps the attention of\nsome such may be attracted?\n\nOn the evening of the day on which they went Mark received a note\nfrom Lady Lufton begging him to call early on the following morning,\nand immediately after breakfast he went across to Framley Court. It\nmay be imagined that he was not in a very happy frame of mind, but he\nfelt the truth of his wife's remark that the first plunge into cold\nwater was always the worst. Lady Lufton was not a woman who would\ncontinually throw his disgrace into his teeth, however terribly cold\nmight be the first words with which she spoke of it. He strove hard\nas he entered her room to carry his usual look and bearing, and to\nput out his hand to greet her with his customary freedom, but he knew\nthat he failed. And it may be said that no good man who has broken\ndown in his goodness can carry the disgrace of his fall without some\nlook of shame. When a man is able to do that, he ceases to be in any\nway good.\n\n\"This has been a distressing affair,\" said Lady Lufton after her\nfirst salutation.\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" said he. \"It has been very sad for poor Fanny.\"\n\n\"Well; we must all have our little periods of grief; and it may\nperhaps be fortunate if none of us have worse than this. She will not\ncomplain, herself, I am sure.\"\n\n\"She complain!\"\n\n\"No, I am sure she will not. And now all I've got to say, Mr.\nRobarts, is this: I hope you and Lufton have had enough to do with\nblack sheep to last you your lives; for I must protest that your late\nfriend Mr. Sowerby is a black sheep.\"\n\nIn no possible way could Lady Lufton have alluded to the matter with\ngreater kindness than in thus joining Mark's name with that of her\nson. It took away all the bitterness of the rebuke, and made the\nsubject one on which even he might have spoken without difficulty.\nBut now, seeing that she was so gentle to him, he could not but lean\nthe more hardly on himself.\n\n\"I have been very foolish,\" said he, \"very foolish and very wrong,\nand very wicked.\"\n\n\"Very foolish, I believe, Mr. Robarts--to speak frankly and once for\nall; but, as I also believe, nothing worse. I thought it best for\nboth of us that we should just have one word about it, and now I\nrecommend that the matter be never mentioned between us again.\"\n\n\"God bless you, Lady Lufton,\" he said. \"I think no man ever had such\na friend as you are.\"\n\nShe had been very quiet during the interview, and almost subdued, not\nspeaking with the animation that was usual to her; for this affair\nwith Mr. Robarts was not the only one she had to complete that day,\nnor, perhaps, the one most difficult of completion. But she cheered\nup a little under the praise now bestowed on her, for it was the\nsort of praise she loved best. She did hope, and, perhaps, flatter\nherself, that she was a good friend.\n\n\"You must be good enough, then, to gratify my friendship by coming up\nto dinner this evening; and Fanny, too, of course. I cannot take any\nexcuse, for the matter is completely arranged. I have a particular\nreason for wishing it.\" These last violent injunctions had been added\nbecause Lady Lufton had seen a refusal rising in the parson's face.\nPoor Lady Lufton! Her enemies--for even she had enemies--used to\ndeclare of her, that an invitation to dinner was the only method of\nshowing itself of which her good-humour was cognizant. But let me ask\nof her enemies whether it is not as good a method as any other known\nto be extant? Under such orders as these obedience was of course a\nnecessity, and he promised that he, with his wife, would come across\nto dinner. And then, when he went away, Lady Lufton ordered her\ncarriage.\n\nDuring these doings at Framley, Lucy Robarts still remained at\nHogglestock, nursing Mrs. Crawley. Nothing occurred to take her back\nto Framley, for the same note from Fanny which gave her the first\ntidings of the arrival of the Philistines told her also of their\ndeparture--and also of the source from whence relief had reached\nthem. \"Don't come, therefore, for that reason,\" said the note, \"but,\nnevertheless, do come as quickly as you can, for the whole house is\nsad without you.\"\n\nOn the morning after the receipt of this note Lucy was sitting, as\nwas now usual with her, beside an old arm-chair to which her patient\nhad lately been promoted. The fever had gone, and Mrs. Crawley was\nslowly regaining her strength--very slowly, and with frequent caution\nfrom the Silverbridge doctor that any attempt at being well too fast\nmight again precipitate her into an abyss of illness and domestic\ninefficiency.\n\n\"I really think I can get about to-morrow,\" said she; \"and then, dear\nLucy, I need not keep you longer from your home.\"\n\n\"You are in a great hurry to get rid of me, I think. I suppose Mr.\nCrawley has been complaining again about the cream in his tea.\"\nMr. Crawley had on one occasion stated his assured conviction that\nsurreptitious daily supplies were being brought into the house,\nbecause he had detected the presence of cream instead of milk in his\nown cup. As, however, the cream had been going for sundry days before\nthis, Miss Robarts had not thought much of his ingenuity in making\nthe discovery.\n\n\"Ah, you do not know how he speaks of you when your back is turned.\"\n\n\"And how does he speak of me? I know you would not have the courage\nto tell me the whole.\"\n\n\"No, I have not; for you would think it absurd coming from one\nwho looks like him. He says that if he were to write a poem about\nwomanhood, he would make you the heroine.\"\n\n\"With a cream-jug in my hand, or else sewing buttons on to a\nshirt-collar. But he never forgave me about the mutton broth. He told\nme, in so many words, that I was a--storyteller. And for the matter\nof that, my dear, so I was.\"\n\n\"He told me that you were an angel.\"\n\n\"Goodness gracious!\"\n\n\"A ministering angel. And so you have been. I can almost feel it in\nmy heart to be glad that I have been ill, seeing that I have had you\nfor my friend.\"\n\n\"But you might have had that good fortune without the fever.\"\n\n\"No, I should not. In my married life I have made no friends till my\nillness brought you to me; nor should I ever really have known you\nbut for that. How should I get to know any one?\"\n\n\"You will now, Mrs. Crawley; will you not? Promise that you will.\nYou will come to us at Framley when you are well? You have promised\nalready, you know.\"\n\n\"You made me do so when I was too weak to refuse.\"\n\n\"And I shall make you keep your promise too. He shall come, also,\nif he likes; but you shall come whether he likes or no. And I won't\nhear a word about your old dresses. Old dresses will wear as well at\nFramley as at Hogglestock.\"\n\nFrom all which it will appear that Mrs. Crawley and Lucy Robarts had\nbecome very intimate during this period of the nursing; as two women\nalways will, or, at least should do, when shut up for weeks together\nin the same sick room.\n\nThe conversation was still going on between them when the sound of\nwheels was heard upon the road. It was no highway that passed before\nthe house, and carriages of any sort were not frequent there.\n\n\"It is Fanny, I am sure,\" said Lucy, rising from her chair.\n\n\"There are two horses,\" said Mrs. Crawley, distinguishing the noise\nwith the accurate sense of hearing which is always attached to\nsickness; \"and it is not the noise of the pony-carriage.\"\n\n\"It is a regular carriage,\" said Lucy, speaking from the window, \"and\nstopping here. It is somebody from Framley Court, for I know the\nservant.\"\n\nAs she spoke a blush came to her forehead. Might it not be Lord\nLufton, she thought to herself,--forgetting at the moment that Lord\nLufton did not go about the country in a close chariot with a fat\nfootman. Intimate as she had become with Mrs. Crawley she had said\nnothing to her new friend on the subject of her love affair.\n\nThe carriage stopped and down came the footman, but nobody spoke to\nhim from the inside.\n\n\"He has probably brought something from Framley,\" said Lucy, having\ncream and such like matters in her mind; for cream and such like\nmatters had come from Framley Court more than once during her sojourn\nthere. \"And the carriage, probably, happened to be coming this way.\"\n\nBut the mystery soon elucidated itself partially, or, perhaps, became\nmore mysterious in another way. The red-armed little girl who had\nbeen taken away by her frightened mother in the first burst of the\nfever had now returned to her place, and at the present moment\nentered the room, with awestruck face, declaring that Miss Robarts\nwas to go at once to the big lady in the carriage.\n\n\"I suppose it's Lady Lufton,\" said Mrs. Crawley.\n\nLucy's heart was so absolutely in her mouth that any kind of speech\nwas at the moment impossible to her. Why should Lady Lufton have\ncome thither to Hogglestock, and why should she want to see her,\nLucy Robarts, in the carriage? Had not everything between them been\nsettled? And yet--! Lucy, in the moment for thought that was allowed\nto her, could not determine what might be the probable upshot of such\nan interview. Her chief feeling was a desire to postpone it for the\npresent instant. But the red-armed little girl would not allow that.\n\n\"You are to come at once,\" said she.\n\nAnd then Lucy, without having spoken a word, got up and left the\nroom. She walked downstairs, along the little passage, and out\nthrough the small garden, with firm steps, but hardly knowing whither\nshe went, or why. Her presence of mind and self-possession had all\ndeserted her. She knew that she was unable to speak as she should do;\nshe felt that she would have to regret her present behaviour, but yet\nshe could not help herself. Why should Lady Lufton have come to her\nthere? She went on, and the big footman stood with the carriage door\nopen. She stepped up almost unconsciously, and, without knowing how\nshe got there, she found herself seated by Lady Lufton.\n\nTo tell the truth her ladyship also was a little at a loss to know\nhow she was to carry through her present plan of operations. The duty\nof beginning, however, was clearly with her, and therefore, having\ntaken Lucy by the hand, she spoke.\n\n\"Miss Robarts,\" she said, \"my son has come home. I don't know whether\nyou are aware of it.\"\n\nShe spoke with a low, gentle voice, not quite like herself, but Lucy\nwas much too confused to notice this.\n\n\"I was not aware of it,\" said Lucy.\n\nShe had, however, been so informed in Fanny's letter, but all that\nhad gone out of her head.\n\n\"Yes; he has come back. He has been in Norway, you know,--fishing.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Lucy.\n\n\"I am sure you will remember all that took place when you came to me,\nnot long ago, in my little room upstairs at Framley Court.\"\n\nIn answer to which, Lucy, quivering in every nerve, and wrongly\nthinking that she was visibly shaking in every limb, timidly answered\nthat she did remember. Why was it that she had then been so bold, and\nnow was so poor a coward?\n\n\"Well, my dear, all that I said to you then I said to you thinking\nthat it was for the best. You, at any rate, will not be angry with me\nfor loving my own son better than I love any one else.\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said Lucy.\n\n\"He is the best of sons, and the best of men, and I am sure that he\nwill be the best of husbands.\"\n\nLucy had an idea, by instinct, however, rather than by sight, that\nLady Lufton's eyes were full of tears as she spoke. As for herself\nshe was altogether blinded and did not dare to lift her face or to\nturn her head. As for the utterance of any sound, that was quite out\nof the question.\n\n\"And now I have come here, Lucy, to ask you to be his wife.\"\n\nShe was quite sure that she heard the words. They came plainly to\nher ears, leaving on her brain their proper sense, but yet she could\nnot move or make any sign that she had understood them. It seemed\nas though it would be ungenerous in her to take advantage of such\nconduct and to accept an offer made with so much self-sacrifice. She\nhad not time at the first moment to think even of his happiness,\nlet alone her own, but she thought only of the magnitude of the\nconcession which had been made to her. When she had constituted Lady\nLufton the arbiter of her destiny she had regarded the question of\nher love as decided against herself. She had found herself unable to\nendure the position of being Lady Lufton's daughter-in-law while Lady\nLufton would be scorning her, and therefore she had given up the\ngame. She had given up the game, sacrificing herself, and, as far as\nit might be a sacrifice, sacrificing him also. She had been resolute\nto stand to her word in this respect, but she had never allowed\nherself to think it possible that Lady Lufton should comply with the\nconditions which she, Lucy, had laid upon her. And yet such was the\ncase, as she so plainly heard. \"And now I have come here, Lucy, to\nask you to be his wife.\"\n\nHow long they sat together silent, I cannot say; counted by minutes\nthe time would not probably have amounted to many, but to each of\nthem the duration seemed considerable. Lady Lufton, while she was\nspeaking, had contrived to get hold of Lucy's hand, and she sat,\nstill holding it, trying to look into Lucy's face,--which, however,\nshe could hardly see, so much was it turned away. Neither, indeed,\nwere Lady Lufton's eyes perfectly dry. No answer came to her\nquestion, and therefore, after a while, it was necessary that she\nshould speak again.\n\n\"Must I go back to him, Lucy, and tell him that there is some other\nobjection--something besides a stern old mother; some hindrance,\nperhaps, not so easily overcome?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Lucy, and it was all which at the moment she could say.\n\n\"What shall I tell him, then? Shall I say yes--simply yes?\"\n\n\"Simply yes,\" said Lucy.\n\n\"And as to the stern old mother who thought her only son too precious\nto be parted with at the first word--is nothing to be said to her?\"\n\n\"Oh, Lady Lufton!\"\n\n\"No forgiveness to be spoken, no sign of affection to be given?\nIs she always to be regarded as stern and cross, vexatious and\ndisagreeable?\"\n\nLucy slowly turned round her head and looked up into her companion's\nface. Though she had as yet no voice to speak of affection she could\nfill her eyes with love, and in that way make to her future mother\nall the promises that were needed.\n\n\"Lucy, dearest Lucy, you must be very dear to me now.\" And then they\nwere in each other's arms, kissing each other.\n\nLady Lufton now desired her coachman to drive up and down for some\nlittle space along the road while she completed her necessary\nconversation with Lucy. She wanted at first to carry her back to\nFramley that evening, promising to send her again to Mrs. Crawley\non the following morning--\"till some permanent arrangement could be\nmade,\" by which Lady Lufton intended the substitution of a regular\nnurse for her future daughter-in-law, seeing that Lucy Robarts was\nnow invested in her eyes with attributes which made it unbecoming\nthat she should sit in attendance at Mrs. Crawley's bedside. But Lucy\nwould not go back to Framley on that evening; no, nor on the next\nmorning. She would be so glad if Fanny would come to her there, and\nthen she would arrange about going home.\n\n\"But, Lucy, dear, what am I to say to Ludovic? Perhaps you would feel\nit awkward if he were to come to see you here.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, Lady Lufton; pray tell him not to do that.\"\n\n\"And is that all that I am to tell him?\"\n\n\"Tell him--tell him--He won't want you to tell him anything;--only I\nshould like to be quiet for a day, Lady Lufton.\"\n\n\"Well, dearest, you shall be quiet; the day after to-morrow\nthen.--Mind we must not spare you any longer, because it will be\nright that you should be at home now. He would think it very hard if\nyou were to be so near, and he was not to be allowed to look at you.\nAnd there will be some one else who will want to see you. I shall\nwant to have you very near to me, for I shall be wretched, Lucy, if I\ncannot teach you to love me.\" In answer to which Lucy did find voice\nenough to make sundry promises.\n\nAnd then she was put out of the carriage at the little wicket gate,\nand Lady Lufton was driven back to Framley. I wonder whether the\nservant when he held the door for Miss Robarts was conscious that he\nwas waiting on his future mistress. I fancy that he was, for these\nsort of people always know everything, and the peculiar courtesy of\nhis demeanour as he let down the carriage steps was very observable.\n\nLucy felt almost beside herself as she returned upstairs, not knowing\nwhat to do, or how to look, and with what words to speak. It behoved\nher to go at once to Mrs. Crawley's room, and yet she longed to be\nalone. She knew that she was quite unable either to conceal her\nthoughts or express them; nor did she wish at the present moment to\ntalk to any one about her happiness,--seeing that she could not at\nthe present moment talk to Fanny Robarts. She went, however, without\ndelay into Mrs. Crawley's room, and with that little eager way of\nspeaking quickly which is so common with people who know that they\nare confused, said that she feared she had been a very long time\naway.\n\n\"And was it Lady Lufton?\"\n\n\"Yes; it was Lady Lufton.\"\n\n\"Why, Lucy; I did not know that you and her ladyship were such\nfriends.\"\n\n\"She had something particular she wanted to say,\" said Lucy, avoiding\nthe question, and avoiding also Mrs. Crawley's eyes; and then she\nsate down in her usual chair.\n\n\"It was nothing unpleasant, I hope.\"\n\n\"No, nothing at all unpleasant; nothing of that kind.--Oh, Mrs.\nCrawley, I'll tell you some other time, but pray do not ask me now.\"\nAnd then she got up and escaped, for it was absolutely necessary that\nshe should be alone.\n\nWhen she reached her own room--that in which the children usually\nslept--she made a great effort to compose herself, but not altogether\nsuccessfully. She got out her paper and blotting-book intending, as\nshe said to herself, to write to Fanny, knowing, however, that the\nletter when written would be destroyed; but she was not able even\nto form a word. Her hand was unsteady and her eyes were dim and her\nthoughts were incapable of being fixed. She could only sit, and\nthink, and wonder, and hope; occasionally wiping the tears from her\neyes, and asking herself why her present frame of mind was so painful\nto her? During the last two or three months she had felt no fear\nof Lord Lufton, had always carried herself before him on equal\nterms, and had been signally capable of doing so when he made his\ndeclaration to her at the parsonage; but now she looked forward with\nan undefined dread to the first moment in which she should see him.\n\nAnd then she thought of a certain evening she had passed at Framley\nCourt, and acknowledged to herself that there was some pleasure in\nlooking back to that. Griselda Grantly had been there, and all the\nconstitutional powers of the two families had been at work to render\neasy a process of love-making between her and Lord Lufton. Lucy had\nseen and understood it all, without knowing that she understood it,\nand had, in a certain degree, suffered from beholding it. She had\nplaced herself apart, not complaining--painfully conscious of some\ninferiority, but, at the same time, almost boasting to herself that\nin her own way she was the superior. And then he had come behind\nher chair, whispering to her, speaking to her his first words of\nkindness and good-nature, and she had resolved that she would be his\nfriend--his friend, even though Griselda Grantly might be his wife.\nWhat those resolutions were worth had soon become manifest to her.\nShe had soon confessed to herself the result of that friendship, and\nhad determined to bear her punishment with courage. But now--\n\nShe sate so for about an hour, and would fain have so sat out the\nday. But as this could not be, she got up, and having washed her face\nand eyes returned to Mrs. Crawley's room. There she found Mr. Crawley\nalso, to her great joy, for she knew that while he was there no\nquestions would be asked of her. He was always very gentle to her,\ntreating her with an old-fashioned polished respect--except when\ncompelled on that one occasion by his sense of duty to accuse her of\nmendacity respecting the purveying of victuals--, but he had never\nbecome absolutely familiar with her as his wife had done; and it was\nwell for her now that he had not done so, for she could not have\ntalked about Lady Lufton.\n\nIn the evening, when the three were present, she did manage to say\nthat she expected Mrs. Robarts would come over on the following day.\n\n\"We shall part with you, Miss Robarts, with the deepest regret,\" said\nMr. Crawley; \"but we would not on any account keep you longer. Mrs.\nCrawley can do without you now. What she would have done, had you not\ncome to us, I am at a loss to think.\"\n\n\"I did not say that I should go,\" said Lucy.\n\n\"But you will,\" said Mrs. Crawley. \"Yes, dear, you will. I know that\nit is proper now that you should return. Nay, but we will not have\nyou any longer. And the poor dear children, too,--they may return.\nHow am I to thank Mrs. Robarts for what she has done for us?\"\n\nIt was settled that if Mrs. Robarts came on the following day Lucy\nshould go back with her; and then, during the long watches of the\nnight--for on this last night Lucy would not leave the bed-side of\nher new friend till long after the dawn had broken--she did tell Mrs.\nCrawley what was to be her destiny in life. To herself there seemed\nnothing strange in her new position; but to Mrs. Crawley it was\nwonderful that she--she, poor as she was--should have an embryo\npeeress at her bedside, handing her her cup to drink, and smoothing\nher pillow that she might be at rest. It was strange, and she could\nhardly maintain her accustomed familiarity. Lucy felt this, at the\nmoment.\n\n\"It must make no difference, you know,\" said she, eagerly; \"none at\nall, between you and me. Promise me that it shall make no\ndifference.\"\n\nThe promise was, of course, exacted; but it was not possible that\nsuch a promise should be kept.\n\nVery early on the following morning--so early that it woke her while\nstill in her first sleep--there came a letter for her from the\nparsonage. Mrs. Robarts had written it, after her return home from\nLady Lufton's dinner.\n\nThe letter said:--\n\n\n   MY OWN OWN DARLING,\n\n   How am I to congratulate you, and be eager enough in\n   wishing you joy? I do wish you joy, and am so very happy.\n   I write now chiefly to say that I shall be over with\n   you about twelve to-morrow, and that I _must_ bring you\n   away with me. If I did not some one else, by no means so\n   trustworthy, would insist on doing it.\n\n\nBut this, though it was thus stated to be the chief part of the\nletter, and though it might be so in matter, was by no means so in\nspace. It was very long, for Mrs. Robarts had sat writing it till\npast midnight.\n\n\n   I will not say anything about him [she went on to say,\n   after two pages had been filled with his name], but I must\n   tell you how beautifully she has behaved. You will own\n   that she is a dear woman; will you not?\n\n\nLucy had already owned it many times since the visit of yesterday,\nand had declared to herself, as she has continued to declare ever\nsince, that she had never doubted it.\n\n\n   She took us by surprise when we got into the drawing-room\n   before dinner, and she told us first of all that she had\n   been to see you at Hogglestock. Lord Lufton, of course,\n   could not keep the secret, but brought it out instantly.\n   I can't tell you now how he told it all, but I am sure you\n   will believe that he did it in the best possible manner.\n   He took my hand and pressed it half a dozen times, and\n   I thought he was going to do something else; but he did\n   not, so you need not be jealous. And she was so nice to\n   Mark, saying such things in praise of you, and paying all\n   manner of compliments to your father. But Lord Lufton\n   scolded her immensely for not bringing you. He said it was\n   lackadaisical and nonsensical; but I could see how much he\n   loved her for what she had done; and she could see it too,\n   for I know her ways, and know that she was delighted with\n   him. She could not keep her eyes off him all the evening,\n   and certainly I never did see him look so well.\n\n   And then while Lord Lufton and Mark were in the\n   dining-room, where they remained a terribly long time, she\n   would make me go through the house that she might show\n   me your rooms, and explain how you were to be mistress\n   there. She has got it all arranged to perfection, and I am\n   sure she has been thinking about it for years. Her great\n   fear at present is that you and he should go and live at\n   Lufton. If you have any gratitude in you, either to her or\n   me, you will not let him do this. I consoled her by saying\n   that there are not two stones upon one another at Lufton\n   as yet; and I believe such is the case. Besides, everybody\n   says that it is the ugliest spot in the world. She went\n   on to declare, with tears in her eyes, that if you were\n   content to remain at Framley, she would never interfere in\n   anything. I do think that she is the best woman that ever\n   lived.\n\n\nSo much as I have given of this letter formed but a small portion of\nit, but it comprises all that it is necessary that we should know.\nExactly at twelve o'clock on that day Puck the pony appeared, with\nMrs. Robarts and Grace Crawley behind him, Grace having been brought\nback as being capable of some service in the house. Nothing that was\nconfidential, and very little that was loving, could be said at the\nmoment, because Mr. Crawley was there, waiting to bid Miss Robarts\nadieu; and he had not as yet been informed of what was to be the\nfuture fate of his visitor. So they could only press each other's\nhands and embrace, which to Lucy was almost a relief; for even to\nher sister-in-law she hardly as yet knew how to speak openly on this\nsubject.\n\n\"May God Almighty bless you, Miss Robarts,\" said Mr. Crawley, as\nhe stood in his dingy sitting-room ready to lead her out to the\npony-carriage. \"You have brought sunshine into this house, even in\nthe time of sickness, when there was no sunshine; and He will bless\nyou. You have been the Good Samaritan, binding up the wounds of the\nafflicted, pouring in oil and balm. To the mother of my children\nyou have given life, and to me you have brought light, and comfort,\nand good words,--making my spirit glad within me as it had not been\ngladdened before. All this hath come of charity, which vaunteth not\nitself and is not puffed up. Faith and hope are great and beautiful,\nbut charity exceedeth them all.\" And having so spoken, instead of\nleading her out, he went away and hid himself.\n\nHow Puck behaved himself as Fanny drove him back to Framley, and\nhow those two ladies in the carriage behaved themselves--of that,\nperhaps, nothing further need be said.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVII.\n\nNEMESIS.\n\n\nBut in spite of all these joyful tidings it must, alas! be remembered\nthat Poena, that just but Rhadamanthine goddess, whom we moderns\nordinarily call Punishment, or Nemesis when we wish to speak of her\ngoddess-ship, very seldom fails to catch a wicked man though she\nhave sometimes a lame foot of her own, and though the wicked man may\npossibly get a start of her. In this instance the wicked man had been\nour unfortunate friend Mark Robarts; wicked in that he had wittingly\ntouched pitch, gone to Gatherum Castle, ridden fast mares across the\ncountry to Cobbold's Ashes, and fallen very imprudently among the\nTozers; and the instrument used by Nemesis was Mr. Tom Towers of the\n_Jupiter_, than whom, in these our days, there is no deadlier scourge\nin the hands of that goddess.\n\nIn the first instance, however, I must mention, though I will not\nrelate, a little conversation which took place between Lady Lufton\nand Mr. Robarts. That gentleman thought it right to say a few words\nmore to her ladyship respecting those money transactions. He could\nnot but feel, he said, that he had received that prebendal stall from\nthe hands of Mr. Sowerby; and under such circumstances, considering\nall that had happened, he could not be easy in his mind as long\nas he held it. What he was about to do would, he was aware, delay\nconsiderably his final settlement with Lord Lufton; but Lufton, he\nhoped, would pardon that, and agree with him as to the propriety of\nwhat he was about to do.\n\nOn the first blush of the thing Lady Lufton did not quite go along\nwith him. Now that Lord Lufton was to marry the parson's sister it\nmight be well that the parson should be a dignitary of the Church;\nand it might be well, also, that one so nearly connected with her son\nshould be comfortable in his money matters. There loomed also, in the\nfuture, some distant possibility of higher clerical honours for a\npeer's brother-in-law; and the top rung of the ladder is always more\neasily attained when a man has already ascended a step or two. But,\nnevertheless, when the matter came to be fully explained to her, when\nshe saw clearly the circumstances under which the stall had been\nconferred, she did agree that it had better be given up.\n\nAnd well for both of them it was--well for them all at Framley--that\nthis conclusion had been reached before the scourge of Nemesis had\nfallen. Nemesis, of course, declared that her scourge had produced\nthe resignation; but it was generally understood that this was a\nfalse boast, for all clerical men at Barchester knew that the stall\nhad been restored to the chapter, or, in other words, into the hands\nof the Government, before Tom Towers had twirled the fatal lash above\nhis head. But the manner of the twirling was as follows:--\n\n\n   It is with difficulty enough [said the article in the\n   _Jupiter_], that the Church of England maintains at the\n   present moment that ascendancy among the religious sects\n   of this country which it so loudly claims. And perhaps\n   it is rather from an old-fashioned and time-honoured\n   affection for its standing than from any intrinsic merits\n   of its own that some such general acknowledgment of its\n   ascendancy is still allowed to prevail. If, however, the\n   patrons and clerical members of this Church are bold\n   enough to disregard all general rules of decent behaviour,\n   we think we may predict that this chivalrous feeling\n   will be found to give way. From time to time we hear of\n   instances of such imprudence, and are made to wonder at\n   the folly of those who are supposed to hold the State\n   Church in the greatest reverence.\n\n   Among those positions of dignified ease to which fortunate\n   clergymen may be promoted are the stalls of the canons\n   or prebendaries in our cathedrals. Some of these, as is\n   well known, carry little or no emolument with them, but\n   some are rich in the good things of this world. Excellent\n   family houses are attached to them, with we hardly know\n   what domestic privileges, and clerical incomes, moreover,\n   of an amount which, if divided, would make glad the hearts\n   of many a hard-working clerical slave. Reform has been\n   busy even among these stalls, attaching some amount of\n   work to the pay, and paring off some superfluous wealth\n   from such of them as were over full; but reform has been\n   lenient with them, acknowledging that it was well to have\n   some such places of comfortable and dignified retirement\n   for those who have worn themselves out in the hard work of\n   their profession. There has of late prevailed a taste for\n   the appointment of young bishops, produced no doubt by a\n   feeling that bishops should be men fitted to get through\n   really hard work; but we have never heard that young\n   prebendaries were considered desirable. A clergyman\n   selected for such a position should, we have always\n   thought, have earned an evening of ease by a long day of\n   work, and should, above all things, be one whose life\n   has been, and therefore in human probability will be,\n   so decorous as to be honourable to the cathedral of his\n   adoption.\n\n   We were, however, the other day given to understand\n   that one of these luxurious benefices, belonging to the\n   cathedral of Barchester, had been bestowed on the Rev.\n   Mark Robarts, the vicar of a neighbouring parish, on the\n   understanding that he should hold the living and the\n   stall together; and on making further inquiry we were\n   surprised to learn that this fortunate gentleman is as yet\n   considerably under thirty years of age. We were desirous,\n   however, of believing that his learning, his piety, and\n   his conduct, might be of a nature to add peculiar grace to\n   his chapter, and therefore, though almost unwillingly, we\n   were silent. But now it has come to our ears, and, indeed,\n   to the ears of all the world, that this piety and conduct\n   are sadly wanting; and judging of Mr. Robarts by his\n   life and associates, we are inclined to doubt even the\n   learning. He has at this moment, or at any rate had but\n   a few days since, an execution in his parsonage house at\n   Framley, on the suit of certain most disreputable bill\n   discounters in London; and probably would have another\n   execution in his other house in Barchester close, but for\n   the fact that he has never thought it necessary to go into\n   residence.\n\n\nThen followed some very stringent, and, no doubt, much-needed advice\nto those clerical members of the Church of England who are supposed\nto be mainly responsible for the conduct of their brethren; and the\narticle ended as follows:--\n\n\n   Many of these stalls are in the gift of the respective\n   deans and chapters, and in such cases the dean and\n   chapters are bound to see that proper persons are\n   appointed; but in other instances the power of selection\n   is vested in the Crown, and then an equal responsibility\n   rests on the government of the day. Mr. Robarts, we learn,\n   was appointed to the stall in Barchester by the late Prime\n   Minister, and we really think that a grave censure rests\n   on him for the manner in which his patronage has been\n   exercised. It may be impossible that he should himself in\n   all such cases satisfy himself by personal inquiry. But\n   our government is altogether conducted on the footing of\n   vicarial responsibility. _Quod facit per alium, facit per\n   se_, is in a special manner true of our ministers, and\n   any man who rises to high position among them must abide\n   by the danger thereby incurred. In this peculiar case\n   we are informed that the recommendation was made by a\n   very recently admitted member of the Cabinet, to whose\n   appointment we alluded at the time as a great mistake. The\n   gentleman in question held no high individual office of\n   his own; but evil such as this which has now been done at\n   Barchester, is exactly the sort of mischief which follows\n   the exaltation of unfit men to high positions, even though\n   no great scope for executive failure may be placed within\n   their reach.\n\n   If Mr. Robarts will allow us to tender to him our advice,\n   he will lose no time in going through such ceremony as may\n   be necessary again to place the stall at the disposal of\n   the Crown!\n\n\nI may here observe that poor Harold Smith, when he read this,\nwrithing in agony, declared it to be the handiwork of his hated\nenemy, Mr. Supplehouse. He knew the mark; so, at least, he said; but\nI myself am inclined to believe that his animosity misled him. I\nthink that one greater than Mr. Supplehouse had taken upon himself\nthe punishment of our poor vicar.\n\nThis was very dreadful to them all at Framley, and, when first read,\nseemed to crush them to atoms. Poor Mrs. Robarts, when she heard it,\nseemed to think that for them the world was over. An attempt had been\nmade to keep it from her, but such attempts always fail, as did this.\nThe article was copied into all the good-natured local newspapers,\nand she soon discovered that something was being hidden. At last it\nwas shown to her by her husband, and then for a few hours she was\nannihilated; for a few days she was unwilling to show herself; and\nfor a few weeks she was very sad. But after that the world seemed to\ngo on much as it had done before; the sun shone upon them as warmly\nas though the article had not been written; and not only the sun\nof heaven, which, as a rule, is not limited in his shining by any\ndisplay of pagan thunder, but also the genial sun of their own\nsphere, the warmth and light of which were so essentially necessary\nto their happiness. Neighbouring rectors did not look glum, nor\ndid the rectors' wives refuse to call. The people in the shops at\nBarchester did not regard her as though she were a disgraced woman,\nthough it must be acknowledged that Mrs. Proudie passed her in the\nclose with the coldest nod of recognition.\n\nOn Mrs. Proudie's mind alone did the article seem to have any\nenduring effect. In one respect it was, perhaps, beneficial; Lady\nLufton was at once induced by it to make common cause with her own\nclergyman, and thus the remembrance of Mr. Robarts' sins passed away\nthe quicker from the minds of the whole Framley Court household.\n\nAnd, indeed, the county at large was not able to give to the matter\nthat undivided attention which would have been considered its due\nat periods of no more than ordinary interest. At the present moment\npreparations were being made for a general election, and although no\ncontest was to take place in the eastern division, a very violent\nfight was being carried on in the west; and the circumstances\nof that fight were so exciting that Mr. Robarts and his article\nwere forgotten before their time. An edict had gone forth from\nGatherum Castle directing that Mr. Sowerby should be turned out, and\nan answering note of defiance had been sounded from Chaldicotes,\nprotesting on behalf of Mr. Sowerby, that the duke's behest would not\nbe obeyed.\n\nThere are two classes of persons in this realm who are\nconstitutionally inefficient to take any part in returning members\nto Parliament--peers, namely, and women; and yet it was soon known\nthrough the whole length and breadth of the county that the present\nelectioneering fight was being carried on between a peer and a\nwoman. Miss Dunstable had been declared the purchaser of the Chace\nof Chaldicotes, as it were, just in the very nick of time; which\npurchase--so men in Barsetshire declared, not knowing anything of the\nfacts--would have gone altogether the other way, had not the giants\nobtained temporary supremacy over the gods. The duke was a supporter\nof the gods, and therefore, so Mr. Fothergill hinted, his money had\nbeen refused. Miss Dunstable was prepared to beard this ducal friend\nof the gods in his own county, and therefore her money had been\ntaken. I am inclined, however, to think that Mr. Fothergill knew\nnothing about it, and to opine that Miss Dunstable, in her eagerness\nfor victory, offered to the Crown more money than the property was\nworth in the duke's opinion, and that the Crown took advantage of her\nanxiety, to the manifest profit of the public at large.\n\nAnd it soon became known also that Miss Dunstable was, in fact, the\nproprietor of the whole Chaldicotes estate, and that in promoting\nthe success of Mr. Sowerby as a candidate for the county, she was\nstanding by her own tenant. It also became known, in the course\nof the battle, that Miss Dunstable had herself at last succumbed,\nand that she was about to marry Dr. Thorne of Greshamsbury, or the\n\"Greshamsbury apothecary,\" as the adverse party now delighted to call\nhim. \"He has been little better than a quack all his life,\" said Dr.\nFillgrave, the eminent physician of Barchester, \"and now he is going\nto marry a quack's daughter.\" By which, and the like to which, Dr.\nThorne did not allow himself to be much annoyed.\n\nBut all this gave rise to a very pretty series of squibs arranged\nbetween Mr. Fothergill and Mr. Closerstill, the electioneering agent.\nMr. Sowerby was named \"the lady's pet,\" and descriptions were given\nof the lady who kept this pet, which were by no means flattering to\nMiss Dunstable's appearance, or manners, or age. And then the western\ndivision of the county was asked in a grave tone--as counties and\nboroughs are asked by means of advertisements stuck up on blind walls\nand barn doors--whether it was fitting and proper that it should be\nrepresented by a woman. Upon which the county was again asked whether\nit was fitting and proper that it should be represented by a duke.\nAnd then the question became more personal as against Miss Dunstable,\nand inquiry was urged whether the county would not be indelibly\ndisgraced if it were not only handed over to a woman, but handed over\nto a woman who sold the oil of Lebanon. But little was got by this\nmove, for an answering placard explained to the unfortunate county\nhow deep would be its shame if it allowed itself to become the\nappanage of any peer, but more especially of a peer who was known to\nbe the most immoral lord that ever disgraced the benches of the upper\nhouse.\n\nAnd so the battle went on very prettily, and, as money was allowed\nto flow freely, the West Barsetshire world at large was not ill\nsatisfied. It is wonderful how much disgrace of that kind a borough\nor county can endure without flinching; and wonderful, also, seeing\nhow supreme is the value attached to the constitution by the realm at\nlarge, how very little the principles of that constitution are valued\nby the people in detail. The duke, of course, did not show himself.\nHe rarely did on any occasion, and never on such occasions as this;\nbut Mr. Fothergill was to be seen everywhere. Miss Dunstable, also,\ndid not hide her light under a bushel; though I here declare, on the\nfaith of an historian, that the rumour spread abroad of her having\nmade a speech to the electors from the top of the porch over the\nhotel-door at Courcy was not founded on fact. No doubt she was at\nCourcy, and her carriage stopped at the hotel; but neither there\nnor elsewhere did she make any public exhibition. \"They must have\nmistaken me for Mrs. Proudie,\" she said, when the rumour reached her\nears.\n\nBut there was, alas! one great element of failure on Miss Dunstable's\nside of the battle. Mr. Sowerby himself could not be induced to fight\nit as became a man. Any positive injunctions that were laid upon him\nhe did, in a sort, obey. It had been a part of the bargain that he\nshould stand the contest, and from that bargain he could not well go\nback; but he had not the spirit left to him for any true fighting on\nhis own part. He could not go up on the hustings, and there defy the\nduke. Early in the affair Mr. Fothergill challenged him to do so, and\nMr. Sowerby never took up the gauntlet.\n\n\"We have heard,\" said Mr. Fothergill, in that great speech which he\nmade at the Omnium Arms at Silverbridge--\"we have heard much during\nthis election of the Duke of Omnium, and of the injuries which he\nis supposed to have inflicted on one of the candidates. The duke's\nname is very frequent in the mouths of the gentlemen,--and of the\nlady,--who support Mr. Sowerby's claims. But I do not think that\nMr. Sowerby himself has dared to say much about the duke. I defy Mr.\nSowerby to mention the duke's name upon the hustings.\"\n\nAnd it so happened that Mr. Sowerby never did mention the duke's\nname.\n\nIt is ill fighting when the spirit is gone, and Mr. Sowerby's spirit\nfor such things was now well nigh broken. It is true that he had\nescaped from the net in which the duke, by Mr. Fothergill's aid,\nhad entangled him; but he had only broken out of one captivity into\nanother. Money is a serious thing; and when gone cannot be had back\nby a shuffle in the game, or a fortunate blow with the battledore, as\nmay political power, or reputation, or fashion. One hundred thousand\npounds gone, must remain as gone, let the person who claims to have\nhad the honour of advancing it be Mrs. B. or my Lord C. No lucky\ndodge can erase such a claim from the things that be--unless, indeed,\nsuch dodge be possible as Mr. Sowerby tried with Miss Dunstable. It\nwas better for him, undoubtedly, to have the lady for a creditor than\nthe duke, seeing that it was possible for him to live as a tenant in\nhis own old house under the lady's reign. But this he found to be a\nsad enough life, after all that was come and gone.\n\nThe election on Miss Dunstable's part was lost. She carried on\nthe contest nobly, fighting it to the last moment, and sparing\nneither her own money nor that of her antagonist; but she carried\nit on unsuccessfully. Many gentlemen did support Mr. Sowerby\nbecause they were willing enough to emancipate their county from\nthe duke's thraldom; but Mr. Sowerby was felt to be a black\nsheep, as Lady Lufton had called him, and at the close of the\nelection he found himself banished from the representation of West\nBarsetshire;--banished for ever, after having held the county for\nfive-and-twenty years.\n\nUnfortunate Mr. Sowerby! I cannot take leave of him here without\nsome feeling of regret, knowing that there was that within him which\nmight, under better guidance, have produced better things. There are\nmen, even of high birth, who seem as though they were born to be\nrogues; but Mr. Sowerby was, to my thinking, born to be a gentleman.\nThat he had not been a gentleman--that he had bolted from his\nappointed course, going terribly on the wrong side of the posts--let\nus all acknowledge. It is not a gentlemanlike deed, but a very\nblackguard action, to obtain a friend's acceptance to a bill in an\nunguarded hour of social intercourse. That and other similar doings\nhave stamped his character too plainly. But, nevertheless, I claim a\ntear for Mr. Sowerby, and lament that he has failed to run his race\ndiscreetly, in accordance with the rules of the Jockey Club.\n\nHe attempted that plan of living as a tenant in his old house at\nChaldicotes and of making a living out of the land which he farmed;\nbut he soon abandoned it. He had no aptitude for such industry,\nand could not endure his altered position in the county. He soon\nrelinquished Chaldicotes of his own accord, and has vanished away, as\nsuch men do vanish--not altogether without necessary income; to which\npoint in the final arrangement of their joint affairs, Mrs. Thorne's\nman of business--if I may be allowed so far to anticipate--paid\nspecial attention.\n\nAnd thus Lord Dumbello, the duke's nominee, got in, as the duke's\nnominee had done for very many years past. There was no Nemesis\nhere--none as yet. Nevertheless, she with the lame foot will\nassuredly catch him, the duke, if it be that he deserve to be caught.\nWith us his grace's appearance has been so unfrequent that I think we\nmay omit to make any further inquiry as to his concerns.\n\nOne point, however, is worthy of notice, as showing the good sense\nwith which we manage our affairs here in England. In an early portion\nof this story the reader was introduced to the interior of Gatherum\nCastle, and there saw Miss Dunstable entertained by the duke in the\nmost friendly manner. Since those days the lady has become the duke's\nneighbour, and has waged a war with him, which he probably felt to\nbe very vexatious. But, nevertheless, on the next great occasion at\nGatherum Castle, Doctor and Mrs. Thorne were among the visitors, and\nto no one was the duke more personally courteous than to his opulent\nneighbour, the late Miss Dunstable.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\n\nHOW THEY WERE ALL MARRIED, HAD TWO CHILDREN,\nAND LIVED HAPPY EVER AFTER.\n\n\nDear, affectionate, sympathetic readers, we have four couple of\nsighing lovers with whom to deal in this our last chapter, and I,\nas leader of the chorus, disdain to press you further with doubts\nas to the happiness of any of that quadrille. They were all made\nhappy, in spite of that little episode which so lately took place at\nBarchester; and in telling of their happiness--shortly, as is now\nnecessary--we will take them chronologically, giving precedence to\nthose who first appeared at the hymeneal altar.\n\nIn July, then, at the cathedral, by the father of the bride, assisted\nby his examining chaplain, Olivia Proudie, the eldest daughter of\nthe Bishop of Barchester, was joined in marriage to the Rev. Tobias\nTickler, incumbent of the Trinity district church in Bethnal Green.\nOf the bridegroom, in this instance, our acquaintance has been so\nshort, that it is not, perhaps, necessary to say much. When coming to\nthe wedding he proposed to bring his three darling children with him;\nbut in this measure he was, I think prudently, stopped by advice,\nrather strongly worded, from his future valued mother-in-law. Mr.\nTickler was not an opulent man, nor had he hitherto attained any\ngreat fame in his profession; but, at the age of forty-three he still\nhad sufficient opportunity before him, and now that his merit has\nbeen properly viewed by high ecclesiastical eyes the refreshing dew\nof deserved promotion will no doubt fall upon him. The marriage was\nvery smart, and Olivia carried herself through the trying ordeal with\nan excellent propriety of conduct.\n\nUp to that time, and even for a few days longer, there was doubt at\nBarchester as to that strange journey which Lord Dumbello undoubtedly\ndid take to France. When a man so circumstanced will suddenly go to\nParis, without notice given even to his future bride, people must\ndoubt; and grave were the apprehensions expressed on this occasion by\nMrs. Proudie, even at her child's wedding-breakfast. \"God bless you,\nmy dear children,\" she said, standing up at the head of her table as\nshe addressed Mr. Tickler and his wife; \"when I see your perfect\nhappiness--perfect, that is, as far as human happiness can be made\nperfect in this vale of tears--and think of the terrible calamity\nwhich has fallen on our unfortunate neighbours, I cannot but\nacknowledge His infinite mercy and goodness. The Lord giveth, and the\nLord taketh away.\" By which she intended, no doubt, to signify that\nwhereas Mr. Tickler had been given to her Olivia, Lord Dumbello had\nbeen taken away from the archdeacon's Griselda. The happy couple\nthen went in Mrs. Proudie's carriage to the nearest railway station\nbut one, and from thence proceeded to Malvern, and there spent the\nhoneymoon.\n\nAnd a great comfort it was, I am sure, to Mrs. Proudie when\nauthenticated tidings reached Barchester that Lord Dumbello had\nreturned from Paris, and that the Hartletop-Grantly alliance was\nto be carried to its completion. She still, however, held her\nopinion--whether correctly or not, who shall say?--that the young\nlord had intended to escape. \"The archdeacon has shown great firmness\nin the way in which he has done it,\" said Mrs. Proudie; \"but whether\nhe has consulted his child's best interests in forcing her into\na marriage with an unwilling husband, I for one must take leave\nto doubt. But then, unfortunately, we all know how completely the\narchdeacon is devoted to worldly matters.\"\n\nIn this instance the archdeacon's devotion to worldly matters was\nrewarded by that success which he no doubt desired. He did go up\nto London, and did see one or two of Lord Dumbello's friends. This\nhe did, not obtrusively, as though in fear of any falsehood or\nvacillation on the part of the viscount, but with that discretion\nand tact for which he has been so long noted. Mrs. Proudie declares\nthat during the few days of his absence from Barsetshire he himself\ncrossed to France and hunted down Lord Dumbello at Paris. As to this\nI am not prepared to say anything; but I am quite sure, as will be\nall those who knew the archdeacon, that he was not a man to see his\ndaughter wronged as long as any measure remained by which such wrong\nmight be avoided.\n\nBut, be that as it may--that mooted question as to the archdeacon's\njourney to Paris--Lord Dumbello was forthcoming at Plumstead on the\n5th of August, and went through his work like a man. The Hartletop\nfamily, when the alliance was found to be unavoidable, endeavoured to\narrange that the wedding should be held at Hartletop Priory, in order\nthat the clerical dust and dinginess of Barchester Close might not\nsoil the splendour of the marriage gala doings; for, to tell the\ntruth, the Hartletopians, as a rule, were not proud of their new\nclerical connections. But on this subject Mrs. Grantly was very\nproperly inexorable; nor, when an attempt was made on the bride to\ninduce her to throw over her mamma at the last moment and pronounce\nfor herself that she would be married at the priory, was it attended\nwith any success. The Hartletopians knew nothing of the Grantly fibre\nand calibre, or they would have made no such attempt. The marriage\ntook place at Plumstead, and on the morning of the day Lord Dumbello\nposted over from Barchester to the rectory. The ceremony was\nperformed by the archdeacon, without assistance, although the dean,\nand the precentor, and two other clergymen, were at the ceremony.\nGriselda's propriety of conduct was quite equal to that of Olivia\nProudie; indeed, nothing could exceed the statuesque grace and fine\naristocratic bearing with which she carried herself on the occasion.\nThe three or four words which the service required of her she said\nwith ease and dignity; there was neither sobbing nor crying to\ndisturb the work or embarrass her friends, and she signed her name in\nthe church books as \"Griselda Grantly\" without a tremor--and without\na regret.\n\nMrs. Grantly kissed her and blessed her in the hall as she was about\nto step forward to her travelling carriage, leaning on her father's\narm, and the child put up her face to her mother for a last whisper.\n\"Mamma,\" she said, \"I suppose Jane can put her hand at once on the\nmoire antique when we reach Dover?\" Mrs. Grantly smiled and nodded,\nand again blessed her child. There was not a tear shed--at least, not\nthen--nor a sign of sorrow to cloud for a moment the gay splendour\nof the day. But the mother did bethink herself, in the solitude of\nher own room, of those last words, and did acknowledge a lack of\nsomething for which her heart had sighed. She had boasted to her\nsister that she had nothing to regret as to her daughter's education;\nbut now, when she was alone after her success, did she feel that she\ncould still support herself with that boast? For, be it known, Mrs.\nGrantly had a heart within her bosom and a faith within her heart.\nThe world, it is true, had pressed upon her sorely with all its\nweight of accumulated clerical wealth, but it had not utterly crushed\nher--not her, but only her child. For the sins of the father, are\nthey not visited on the third and fourth generation?\n\nBut if any such feeling of remorse did for awhile mar the fulness\nof Mrs. Grantly's joy, it was soon dispelled by the perfect success\nof her daughter's married life. At the end of the autumn the bride\nand bridegroom returned from their tour, and it was evident to all\nthe circle at Hartletop Priory that Lord Dumbello was by no means\ndissatisfied with his bargain. His wife had been admired everywhere\nto the top of his bent. All the world at Ems, and at Baden, and\nat Nice, had been stricken by the stately beauty of the young\nviscountess. And then, too, her manner, style, and high dignity\nof demeanour altogether supported the reverential feeling which\nher grace and form at first inspired. She never derogated from her\nhusband's honour by the fictitious liveliness of gossip, or allowed\nany one to forget the peeress in the woman. Lord Dumbello soon found\nthat his reputation for discretion was quite safe in her hands, and\nthat there were no lessons as to conduct in which it was necessary\nthat he should give instruction.\n\nBefore the winter was over she had equally won the hearts of all\nthe circle at Hartletop Priory. The duke was there and declared to\nthe marchioness that Dumbello could not possibly have done better.\n\"Indeed, I do not think he could,\" said the happy mother. \"She sees\nall that she ought to see, and nothing that she ought not.\"\n\nAnd then, in London, when the season came, all men sang all manner\nof praises in her favour, and Lord Dumbello was made aware that he\nwas reckoned among the wisest of his age. He had married a wife who\nmanaged everything for him, who never troubled him, whom no woman\ndisliked, and whom every man admired. As for feast of reason and\nfor flow of soul, is it not a question whether any such flows and\nfeasts are necessary between a man and his wife? How many men can\ntruly assert that they ever enjoy connubial flows of soul, or that\nconnubial feasts of reason are in their nature enjoyable? But a\nhandsome woman at the head of your table, who knows how to dress, and\nhow to sit, and how to get in and out of her carriage--who will not\ndisgrace her lord by her ignorance, or fret him by her coquetry, or\ndisparage him by her talent--how beautiful a thing it is! For my own\npart I think that Griselda Grantly was born to be the wife of a great\nEnglish peer.\n\n\"After all, then,\" said Miss Dunstable, speaking of Lady\nDumbello--she was Mrs. Thorne at this time--\"after all, there is some\ntruth in what our quaint latter-day philosopher tells us--'Great are\nthy powers, O Silence!'\"\n\nThe marriage of our old friends Dr. Thorne and Miss Dunstable was the\nthird on the list, but that did not take place till the latter end of\nSeptember. The lawyers on such an occasion had no inconsiderable work\nto accomplish, and though the lady was not coy, nor the gentleman\nslow, it was not found practicable to arrange an earlier wedding. The\nceremony was performed at St. George's, Hanover Square, and was not\nbrilliant in any special degree. London at the time was empty, and\nthe few persons whose presence was actually necessary were imported\nfrom the country for the occasion. The bride was given away by Dr.\nEasyman, and the two bridesmaids were ladies who had lived with Miss\nDunstable as companions. Young Mr. Gresham and his wife were there,\nas was also Mrs. Harold Smith, who was not at all prepared to drop\nher old friend in her new sphere of life.\n\n\"We shall call her Mrs. Thorne instead of Miss Dunstable, and I\nreally think that that will be all the difference,\" said Mrs. Harold\nSmith.\n\nTo Mrs. Harold Smith that probably was all the difference, but it was\nnot so to the persons most concerned.\n\nAccording to the plan of life arranged between the doctor and his\nwife she was still to keep up her house in London, remaining there\nduring such period of the season as she might choose, and receiving\nhim when it might appear good to him to visit her; but he was to be\nthe master in the country. A mansion at the Chace was to be built,\nand till such time as that was completed, they would keep on the old\nhouse at Greshamsbury. Into this, small as it was, Mrs. Thorne,--in\nspite of her great wealth,--did not disdain to enter. But subsequent\ncircumstances changed their plans. It was found that Mr. Sowerby\ncould not or would not live at Chaldicotes; and, therefore, in the\nsecond year of their marriage, that place was prepared for them.\nThey are now well known to the whole county as Dr. and Mrs. Thorne\nof Chaldicotes,--of Chaldicotes, in distinction to the well-known\nThornes of Ullathorne in the eastern division. Here they live\nrespected by their neighbours, and on terms of alliance both with\nthe Duke of Omnium and with Lady Lufton. \"Of course those dear old\navenues will be very sad to me,\" said Mrs. Harold Smith, when at the\nend of a London season she was invited down to Chaldicotes; and as\nshe spoke she put her handkerchief up to her eyes.\n\n\"Well, dear, what can I do?\" said Mrs. Thorne. \"I can't cut them\ndown; the doctor would not let me.\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said Mrs. Harold Smith, sighing; and in spite of her\nfeelings she did visit Chaldicotes.\n\nBut it was October before Lord Lufton was made a happy man;--that\nis, if the fruition of his happiness was a greater joy than the\nanticipation of it. I will not say that the happiness of marriage is\nlike the Dead Sea fruit,--an apple which, when eaten, turns to bitter\nashes in the mouth. Such pretended sarcasm would be very false.\nNevertheless, is it not the fact that the sweetest morsel of love's\nfeast has been eaten, that the freshest, fairest blush of the flower\nhas been snatched and has passed away, when the ceremony at the altar\nhas been performed, and legal possession has been given? There is an\naroma of love, an undefinable delicacy of flavour, which escapes and\nis gone before the church portal is left, vanishing with the maiden\nname, and incompatible with the solid comfort appertaining to the\nrank of wife. To love one's own spouse, and to be loved by her, is\nthe ordinary lot of man, and is a duty exacted under penalties. But\nto be allowed to love youth and beauty that is not one's own--to know\nthat one is loved by a soft being who still hangs cowering from the\neye of the world as though her love were all but illicit--can it be\nthat a man is made happy when a state of anticipation such as this is\nbrought to a close? No; when the husband walks back from the altar,\nhe has already swallowed the choicest dainties of his banquet. The\nbeef and pudding of married life are then in store for him;--or\nperhaps only the bread and cheese. Let him take care lest hardly a\ncrust remain,--or perhaps not a crust.\n\nBut before we finish, let us go back for one moment to the\ndainties,--to the time before the beef and pudding were\nserved,--while Lucy was still at the parsonage, and Lord Lufton still\nstaying at Framley Court. He had come up one morning, as was now\nfrequently his wont, and, after a few minutes' conversation, Mrs.\nRobarts had left the room,--as not unfrequently on such occasions was\nher wont. Lucy was working and continued her work, and Lord Lufton\nfor a moment or two sat looking at her; then he got up abruptly, and\nstanding before her, thus questioned her:--\n\n\"Lucy,\" said he.\n\n\"Well, what of Lucy now? Any particular fault this morning?\"\n\n\"Yes, a most particular fault. When I asked you, here, in this room,\non this very spot, whether it was possible that you should love\nme--why did you say that it was impossible?\"\n\nLucy, instead of answering at the moment, looked down upon the\ncarpet, to see if his memory were as good as hers. Yes; he was\nstanding on the exact spot where he had stood before. No spot in all\nthe world was more frequently clear before her own eyes.\n\n\"Do you remember that day, Lucy?\" he said again.\n\n\"Yes, I remember it,\" she said.\n\n\"Why did you say it was impossible?\"\n\n\"Did I say impossible?\"\n\nShe knew that she had said so. She remembered how she had waited till\nhe had gone, and that then, going to her own room, she had reproached\nherself with the cowardice of the falsehood. She had lied to him\nthen; and now--how was she punished for it?\n\n\"Well, I suppose it was possible,\" she said.\n\n\"But why did you say so when you knew it would make me so miserable?\"\n\n\"Miserable! nay, but you went away happy enough! I thought I had\nnever seen you look better satisfied.\"\n\n\"Lucy!\"\n\n\"You had done your duty and had had such a lucky escape! What\nastonishes me is that you should have ever come back again. But the\npitcher may go to the well once too often, Lord Lufton.\"\n\n\"But will you tell me the truth now?\"\n\n\"What truth?\"\n\n\"That day, when I came to you,--did you love me at all then?\"\n\n\"We'll let bygones be bygones, if you please.\"\n\n\"But I swear you shall tell me. It was such a cruel thing to answer\nme as you did, unless you meant it. And yet you never saw me again\ntill after my mother had been over for you to Mrs. Crawley's.\"\n\n\"It was absence that made me--care for you.\"\n\n\"Lucy, I swear I believe you loved me then.\"\n\n\"Ludovic, some conjuror must have told you that.\"\n\nShe was standing as she spoke, and, laughing at him, she held up her\nhands and shook her head. But she was now in his power, and he had\nhis revenge,--his revenge for her past falsehood and her present\njoke. How could he be more happy when he was made happy by having her\nall his own, than he was now?\n\nAnd in these days there again came up that petition as to her\nriding--with very different result now than on that former occasion.\nThere were ever so many objections, then. There was no habit, and\nLucy was--or said that she was--afraid; and then, what would Lady\nLufton say? But now Lady Lufton thought it would be quite right;\nonly were they quite sure about the horse? Was Ludovic certain that\nthe horse had been ridden by a lady? And Lady Meredith's habits\nwere dragged out as a matter of course, and one of them chipped and\nsnipped and altered, without any compunction. And as for fear, there\ncould be no bolder horsewoman than Lucy Robarts. It was quite clear\nto all Framley that riding was the very thing for her. \"But I never\nshall be happy, Ludovic, till you have got a horse properly suited\nfor her,\" said Lady Lufton.\n\nAnd then, also, came the affair of her wedding garments, of her\n_trousseau_,--as to which I cannot boast that she showed capacity\nor steadiness at all equal to that of Lady Dumbello. Lady Lufton,\nhowever, thought it a very serious matter; and as, in her opinion,\nMrs. Robarts did not go about it with sufficient energy, she took the\nmatter mainly into her own hands, striking Lucy dumb by her frowns\nand nods, deciding on everything herself, down to the very tags of\nthe boot-ties.\n\n\"My dear, you really must allow me to know what I am about;\" and\nLady Lufton patted her on the arm as she spoke. \"I did it all for\nJustinia, and she never had reason to regret a single thing that\nI bought. If you'll ask her, she'll tell you so.\"\n\nLucy did not ask her future sister-in-law, seeing that she had no\ndoubt whatever as to her future mother-in-law's judgment on the\narticles in question. Only the money! And what could she want with\nsix dozen pocket-handkerchiefs all at once? There was no question\nof Lord Lufton's going out as governor-general to India! But twelve\ndozen pocket-handkerchiefs had not been too many for Griselda's\nimagination.\n\nAnd Lucy would sit alone in the drawing-room at Framley Court,\nfilling her heart with thoughts of that evening when she had first\nsat there. She had then resolved, painfully, with inward tears, with\ngroanings of her spirit, that she was wrongly placed in being in that\ncompany. Griselda Grantly had been there, quite at her ease, petted\nby Lady Lufton, admired by Lord Lufton; while she had retired out of\nsight, sore at heart, because she felt herself to be no fit companion\nto those around her. Then he had come to her, making matters almost\nworse by talking to her, bringing the tears into her eyes by his\ngood-nature, but still wounding her by the feeling that she could not\nspeak to him at her ease.\n\nBut things were at a different pass with her now. He had chosen\nher--her out of all the world, and brought her there to share with\nhim his own home, his own honours, and all that he had to give. She\nwas the apple of his eye, and the pride of his heart. And the stern\nmother, of whom she had stood so much in awe, who at first had\npassed her by as a thing not to be noticed, and had then sent out\nto her that she might be warned to keep herself aloof, now hardly\nknew in what way she might sufficiently show her love, regard, and\nsolicitude.\n\nI must not say that Lucy was not proud in these moments--that her\nheart was not elated at these thoughts. Success does beget pride, as\nfailure begets shame. But her pride was of that sort which is in no\nway disgraceful to either man or woman, and was accompanied by pure\ntrue love, and a full resolution to do her duty in that state of life\nto which it had pleased her God to call her. She did rejoice greatly\nto think that she had been chosen, and not Griselda. Was it possible\nthat having loved she should not so rejoice, or that, rejoicing, she\nshould not be proud of her love?\n\nThey spent the whole winter abroad, leaving the dowager Lady Lufton\nto her plans and preparations for their reception at Framley Court;\nand in the following spring they appeared in London, and there set\nup their staff. Lucy had some inner tremblings of the spirit, and\nquiverings about the heart, at thus beginning her duty before the\ngreat world, but she said little or nothing to her husband on the\nmatter. Other women had done as much before her time, and by courage\nhad gone through with it. It would be dreadful enough, that position\nin her own house with lords and ladies bowing to her, and stiff\nmembers of Parliament for whom it would be necessary to make small\ntalk; but, nevertheless, it was to be endured. The time came, and she\ndid endure it. The time came, and before the first six weeks were\nover she found that it was easy enough. The lords and ladies got into\ntheir proper places and talked to her about ordinary matters in a\nway that made no effort necessary, and the members of Parliament\nwere hardly more stiff than the clergymen she had known in the\nneighbourhood of Framley.\n\nShe had not been long in town before she met Lady Dumbello. At this\ninterview also she had to overcome some little inward emotion. On the\nfew occasions on which she had met Griselda Grantly at Framley they\nhad not much progressed in friendship, and Lucy had felt that she had\nbeen despised by the rich beauty. She also in her turn had disliked,\nif she had not despised, her rival. But how would it be now? Lady\nDumbello could hardly despise her, and yet it did not seem possible\nthat they should meet as friends. They did meet, and Lucy came\nforward with a pretty eagerness to give her hand to Lady Lufton's\nlate favourite. Lady Dumbello smiled slightly--the same old smile\nwhich had come across her face when they two had been first\nintroduced in the Framley drawing-room; the same smile without the\nvariation of a line,--took the offered hand, muttered a word or\ntwo, and then receded. It was exactly as she had done before. She\nhad never despised Lucy Robarts. She had accorded to the parson's\nsister the amount of cordiality with which she usually received her\nacquaintance; and now she could do no more for the peer's wife. Lady\nDumbello and Lady Lufton have known each other ever since, and have\noccasionally visited at each other's houses, but the intimacy between\nthem has never gone beyond this.\n\nThe dowager came up to town for about a month, and while there was\ncontented to fill a second place. She had no desire to be the great\nlady in London. But then came the trying period when they commenced\ntheir life together at Framley Court. The elder lady formally\nrenounced her place at the top of the table,--formally persisted in\nrenouncing it though Lucy with tears implored her to resume it. She\nsaid also, with equal formality--repeating her determination over and\nover again to Mrs. Robarts with great energy--that she would in no\nrespect detract by interference of her own from the authority of the\nproper mistress of the house; but, nevertheless, it is well known to\nevery one at Framley that old Lady Lufton still reigns paramount in\nthe parish.\n\n\"Yes, my dear; the big room looking into the little garden to the\nsouth was always the nursery; and if you ask my advice, it will still\nremain so. But, of course, any room you please--\"\n\nAnd the big room looking into the little garden to the south is still\nthe nursery at Framley Court.\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK FRAMLEY PARSONAGE***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 2860-8.txt or 2860-8.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/dirs\/2\/8\/6\/2860\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":551,"split":"train"}
