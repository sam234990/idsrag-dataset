Reinhard, who's five years older than Elisabeth, impresses her by writing fairy tales on slips of paper for her. Without Elisabeth knowing, Reinhard additionally keeps a vellum-bound book in which he composes poems about his life experiences.\nDespite his young age, Reinhard is sure that he wants to spend his whole life with Elisabeth. Neither a new school, nor his new male friends can change this. He reveals his childhood dream of a life together in India to Elisabeth. After a moment of hesitation, 5-year old Elisabeth approves to his future plans.\nAt the age of seventeen, the moment of separation from Elisabeth comes inescapably closer. Although he will pursue his education in town, Reinhard promises to continue writing fairy tales for her and send them by letter to his mother. She is delighted about this idea for she cannot imagine a life without Reinhard.\nSoon enough Christmas Eve comes along. Reinhard spends his time with his fellow students in the Ratskeller, where he shows interest to a girl playing the zither accompanied by a fiddler. After acting coy, she eventually sings for Reinhard. However, he offends her by heading home in a rush after receiving a message from an arrival. There Reinhard finds a parcel. Excited, he looks at the parcel's content. Besides a cake and some personal items the parcel also contains letters from Elizabeth and his mother. In her letter Elisabeth complains about the death of the bird which Reinhard gave her as a present. Furthermore, she reproaches him for not writing fairy tales for her anymore. He is overwhelmed by a desire to return home. Immediately, he writes letters to Elisabeth and his mother after taking a walk, during which he gives half of the cake to a beggar girl.\nAt Easter, after a long-awaited time, Reinhard returns to see Elisabeth. However, they seem to have grown apart. In Reinhard's absence, his old schoolfriend Erich has inherited his father's farm at Immensee. Erich gave a new bird to Elisabeth. Reinhard entrusts his personal diary to Elisabeth, who is unsettled by the many poems he dedicated to her. When he asks her to hand him the book back, she returns it to him along with his favourite flower. Shortly before his departure Reinhard makes Elisabeth promise that she will still love him after his two-year absence. He leaves having told her that he has a secret, which he vows to tell her upon his return. Two more years pass by with no more correspondence between the two of them, then Reinhard gets a letter from his mother about Elisabeth and Erich's engagement. Elisabeth had twice rejected Erich's proposal.\nA few years later Reinhard accepts Erich's invitation to Immensee without Elisabeth and her mother knowing. Elisabeth is very happy about Reinhard's unexpected arrival. Reinhard has collected several poems and songs over the last few years and now he is asked to perform some of his latest folksongs. With the evening drawing near, Reinhard recites some verses of a romantic drama, prompting Elisabeth to leave the small party embarrassed. Shortly afterwards, Reinhard is on his way down to the lake where he tries to reach a water lily by swimming into the middle. He cannot reach it and returns to the shore scared.\nThe following afternoon Reinhard and Elisabeth go for a walk on the other side of the lake. Discovering a field of erica and listening to Reinhard's words about lost youth bring tears to Elisabeth's eyes. In silence they make their way back to the house by boat but Reinhard returns alone later.\nDuring the whole time at the manor Reinhard is not able to express his thoughts. He decides to abandon Immensee early next morning, leaving a note behind but Elisabeth surprises him when she anticipates his plan to depart and never come back. He withdraws himself from her sight stepping outside and taking off.\nAt late dusk, in his mind's eye, the old man once more catches sight of the water lily on the lake through the window. The lily seems to be close but still unreachable. He remembers his bygone youth and delves into his studies, to which he dedicated a lot of time in the past.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Immensee, by Theodore W.

STORM\n\nTRANSLATED BY C. W. BELL M. A.\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE\n\n\n\nWe are at the beginning of a new era which will, it is to be hoped, be\nmarked by a general _rapprochement_ between the nations. The need to\nknow and understand one another is being felt more and more. It follows\nthat the study of foreign languages will assume an ever-increasing\nimportance; indeed, so far as language, literature, and music are\nconcerned, one may safely assert that _fas est et ab hoste doceri_.\n\nAll those who wish to make acquaintance with the speech of their\nneighbours, or who have allowed their former knowledge to grow rusty,\nwill welcome this edition, which will enable them, independently of\nbulky dictionaries, to devote to language study the moments of leisure\nwhich offer themselves in the course of the day.\n\nThe texts have been selected from the double point of view of their\nliterary worth and of the usefulness of their vocabulary; in the\ntranslations, also, the endeavour has been to unite qualities of style\nwith strict fidelity to the original.\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\n\nTheodor W. Storm, poet and short-story writer (1817-1888), was born in\nSchleswig. He was called to the Bar in his native town, Husum, in\n1842, but had his licence to practise cancelled in 1853 for\n'Germanophilism,' and had to remove to Germany. It was only in 1864\nthat he was able to return to Husum, where in 1874 he became a judge\nof the Court of Appeals.\n\nAs early as 1843 he had made himself known as a lyrical poet of the\nRomantic School, but it was as a short-story writer that he first took\na prominent place in literature, making a most happy _d\u00c3\u00a9but_ with\nthe story entitled _Immensee_.\n\nThere followed a long series of tales, rich in fancy and in humour,\nalthough their inspiration is generally derived from the humble town\nand country life which formed his immediate environment; but he wrote\nnothing that excels, in depth and tenderness of feeling, the charming\nstory of _Immensee_; and taking his work all in all, Storm still\nranks to-day as a master of the short story in German literature, rich\nthough it is in this form of prose-fiction.\n\n\n\n\nIMMENSEE\n\n\n\n\nTHE OLD MAN\n\n\n\nOne afternoon in the late autumn a well-dressed old man was walking\nslowly down the street. He appeared to be returning home from a walk,\nfor his buckle-shoes, which followed a fashion long since out of date,\nwere covered with dust.\n\nUnder his arm he carried a long, gold-headed cane; his dark eyes, in\nwhich the whole of his long-lost youth seemed to have centred, and\nwhich contrasted strangely with his snow-white hair, gazed calmly on\nthe sights around him or peered into the town below as it lay before\nhim, bathed in the haze of sunset. He appeared to be almost a\nstranger, for of the passers-by only a few greeted him, although many\na one involuntarily was compelled to gaze into those grave eyes.\n\nAt last he halted before a high, gabled house, cast one more glance\nout toward the town, and then passed into the hall. At the sound of\nthe door-bell some one in the room within drew aside the green curtain\nfrom a small window that looked out on to the hall, and the face of an\nold woman was seen behind it. The man made a sign to her with his\ncane.\n\n\"No light yet!\" he said in a slightly southern accent, and the\nhousekeeper let the curtain fall again.\n\nThe old man now passed through the broad hall, through an inner hall,\nwherein against the walls stood huge oaken chests bearing porcelain\nvases; then through the door opposite he entered a small lobby, from\nwhich a narrow staircase led to the upper rooms at the back of the\nhouse. He climbed the stairs slowly, unlocked a door at the top, and\nlanded in a room of medium size.\n\nIt was a comfortable, quiet retreat. One of the walls was lined with\ncupboards and bookcases; on the other hung pictures of men and places;\non a table with a green cover lay a number of open books, and before\nthe table stood a massive arm-chair with a red velvet cushion.\n\nAfter the old man had placed his hat and stick in a corner, he sat down\nin the arm-chair and, folding his hands, seemed to be taking his rest\nafter his walk. While he sat thus, it was growing gradually darker; and\nbefore long a moonbeam came streaming through the window-panes and upon\nthe pictures on the wall; and as the bright band of light passed slowly\nonward the old man followed it involuntarily with his eyes.\n\nNow it reached a little picture in a simple black frame. \"Elisabeth!\"\nsaid the old man softly; and as he uttered the word, time had changed:\n_he was young again_.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nTHE CHILDREN\n\n\n\nBefore very long the dainty form of a little maiden advanced toward\nhim. Her name was Elisabeth, and she might have been five years old.\nHe himself was twice that age. Round her neck she wore a red silk\nkerchief which was very becoming to her brown eyes.\n\n\"Reinhard!\" she cried, \"we have a holiday, a holiday! No school the\nwhole day and none to-morrow either!\"\n\nReinhard was carrying his slate under his arm, but he flung it behind\nthe front door, and then both the children ran through the house into\nthe garden and through the garden gate out into the meadow. The\nunexpected holiday came to them at a most happily opportune moment.\n\nIt was in the meadow that Reinhard, with Elisabeth's help, had built a\nhouse out of sods of grass. They meant to live in it during the summer\nevenings; but it still wanted a bench. He set to work at once; nails,\nhammer, and the necessary boards were already to hand.\n\nWhile he was thus engaged, Elisabeth went along the dyke, gathering\nthe ring-shaped seeds of the wild mallow in her apron, with the object\nof making herself chains and necklaces out of them; so that when\nReinhard had at last finished his bench in spite of many a crookedly\nhammered nail, and came out into the sunlight again, she was already\nwandering far away at the other end of the meadow.\n\n\"Elisabeth!\" he called, \"Elisabeth!\" and then she came, her hair\nstreaming behind her.\n\n\"Come here,\" he said; \"our house is finished now. Why, you have got\nquite hot! Come in, and let us sit on the new bench. I will tell you a\nstory.\"\n\nSo they both went in and sat down on the new bench. Elisabeth took the\nlittle seed-rings out of her apron and strung them on long threads.\nReinhard began his tale: \"There were once upon a time three\nspinning-women...\"[1]\n\n[1] The beginning of one of the best known of Grimm's fairy tales.\n\n\"Oh!\" said Elisabeth, \"I know that off by heart; you really must not\nalways tell me the same story.\"\n\nAccordingly Reinhard had to give up the story of the three\nspinning-women and tell instead the story of the poor man who was cast\ninto the den of lions.\n\n\"It was now night,\" he said, \"black night, you know, and the lions\nwere asleep. But every now and then they would yawn in their sleep and\nshoot out their red tongues. And then the man would shudder and think\nit was morning. All at once a bright light fell all about him, and\nwhen he looked up an angel was standing before him. The angel beckoned\nto him with his hand and then went straight into the rocks.\"\n\nElisabeth had been listening attentively. \"An angel?\" she said. \"Had\nhe wings then?\"\n\n\"It is only a story,\" answered Reinhard; \"there are no angels, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"Oh, fie! Reinhard!\" she said, staring him straight in the face.\n\nHe looked at her with a frown, and she asked him hesitatingly: \"Well,\nwhy do they always say there are? mother, and aunt, and at school as\nwell?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" he answered.\n\n\"But tell me,\" said Elisabeth, \"are there no lions either?\"\n\n\"Lions? Are there lions? In India, yes. The heathen priests harness\nthem to their carriages, and drive about the desert with them. When\nI'm big, I mean to go out there myself. It is thousands of times more\nbeautiful in that country than it is here at home; there's no winter\nat all there. And you must come with me. Will you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Elisabeth; \"but mother must come with us, and your mother\nas well.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Reinhard, \"they will be too old then, and cannot come with\nus.\"\n\n\"But I mayn't go by myself.\"\n\n\"Oh, but you may right enough; you will then really be my wife, and\nthe others will have no say in the matter.\"\n\n\"But mother will cry!\"\n\n\"We shall come back again of course,\" said Reinhard impetuously. \"Now\njust tell me straight out, will you go with me? If not, I will go all\nalone, and then I shall never come back again.\"\n\nThe little girl came very near to crying. \"Please don't look so\nangry,\" said she; \"I will go to India with you.\"\n\nReinhard seized both her hands with frantic glee, and rushed out with\nher into the meadow.\n\n\"To India, to India!\" he sang, and swung her round and round, so that\nher little red kerchief was whirled from off her neck. Then he\nsuddenly let her go and said solemnly:\n\n\"Nothing will come of it, I'm sure; you haven't the pluck.\"\n\n\"Elisabeth! Reinhard!\" some one was now calling from the garden gate.\n\"Here we are!\" the children answered, and raced home hand in hand.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nIN THE WOODS\n\n\n\nSo the children lived together. She was often too quiet for him, and\nhe was often too head-strong for her, but for all that they stuck to\none another. They spent nearly all their leisure hours together: in\nwinter in their mothers' tiny rooms, during the summer in wood and\nfield.\n\nOnce when Elisabeth was scolded by the teacher in Reinhard's hearing,\nhe angrily banged his slate upon the table in order to turn upon\nhimself the master's wrath. This failed to attract attention.\n\nBut Reinhard paid no further attention to the geography lessons, and\ninstead he composed a long poem, in which he compared himself to a\nyoung eagle, the schoolmaster to a grey crow, and Elisabeth to a white\ndove; the eagle vowed vengeance on the grey crow, as soon as his wings\nhad grown.\n\nTears stood in the young poet's eyes: he felt very proud of himself.\nWhen he reached home he contrived to get hold of a little\nparchment-bound volume with a lot of blank pages in it; and on the first\npages he elaborately wrote out his first poem.\n\nSoon after this he went to another school. Here he made many new\nfriendships among boys of his own age, but this did not interrupt his\ncomings and goings with Elisabeth. Of the stories which he had\nformerly told her over and over again he now began to write down the\nones which she had liked best, and in doing so the fancy often took\nhim to weave in something of his own thoughts; yet, for some reason he\ncould not understand, he could never manage it.\n\nSo he wrote them down exactly as he had heard them himself. Then he\nhanded them over to Elisabeth, who kept them carefully in a drawer of\nher writing-desk, and now and again of an evening when he was present\nit afforded him agreeable satisfaction to hear her reading aloud to\nher mother these little tales out of the notebooks in which he had\nwritten them.\n\nSeven years had gone by. Reinhard was to leave the town in order to\nproceed to his higher education. Elisabeth could not bring herself to\nthink that there would now be a time to be passed entirely without\nReinhard. She was delighted when he told her one day that he would\ncontinue to write out stories for her as before; he would send them to\nher in the letters to his mother, and then she would have to write\nback to him and tell him how she liked them.\n\nThe day of departure was approaching, but ere it came a good deal more\npoetry found its way into the parchment-bound volume. This was the one\nsecret he kept from Elisabeth, although she herself had inspired the\nwhole book and most of the songs, which gradually had filled up almost\nhalf of the blank pages.\n\nIt was the month of June, and Reinhard was to start on the following\nday. It was proposed to spend one more festive day together and\ntherefore a picnic was arranged for a rather large party of friends in\nan adjacent forest.\n\nIt was an hour's drive along the road to the edge of the wood, and\nthere the company took down the provision baskets from the carriages\nand walked the rest of the way. The road lay first of all through a\npine grove, where it was cool and darksome, and the ground was all\nstrewed with pine needles.\n\nAfter half an hour's walk they passed out of the gloom of the pine\ntrees into a bright fresh beech wood. Here everything was light and\ngreen; every here and there a sunbeam burst through the leafy\nbranches, and high above their heads a squirrel was leaping from\nbranch to branch.\n\nThe party came to a halt at a certain spot, over which the topmost\nbranches of ancient beech trees interwove a transparent canopy of\nleaves. Elisabeth's mother opened one of the baskets, and an old\ngentleman constituted himself quartermaster.\n\n\"Round me, all of you young people,\" he cried, \"and attend carefully\nto what I have to say to you. For lunch each one of you will now get\ntwo dry rolls; the butter has been left behind at home. The extras\nevery one must find for himself. There are plenty of strawberries in\nthe wood--that is, for anyone who knows where to find them. Unless you\nare sharp, you'll have to eat dry bread; that's the way of the world\nall over. Do you understand what I say?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" cried the young folks.\n\n\"Yes, but look here,\" said the old gentleman, \"I have not done yet. We\nold folks have done enough roaming about in our time, and therefore we\nwill stay at home now, here, I mean, under these wide-spreading trees,\nand we'll peel the potatoes and make a fire and lay the table, and by\ntwelve o'clock the eggs shall be boiled.\n\n\"In return for all this you will be owing us half of your\nstrawberries, so that we may also be able to serve some dessert. So\noff you go now, east and west, and mind be honest.\"\n\nThe young folks cast many a roguish glance at one another.\n\n\"Wait,\" cried the old gentleman once again. \"I suppose I need not tell\nyou this, that whoever finds none need not produce any; but take\nparticular note of this, that he will get nothing out of us old folks\neither. Now you have had enough good advice for to-day; and if you\ngather strawberries to match you will get on very well for the present\nat any rate.\"\n\nThe young people were of the same opinion, and pairing off in couples\nset out on their quest.\n\n\"Come along, Elisabeth,\" said Reinhard, \"I know where there is a clump\nof strawberry bushes; you shan't eat dry bread.\"\n\nElisabeth tied the green ribbons of her straw hat together and hung it\non her arm. \"Come on, then,\" she said, \"the basket is ready.\"\n\nOff into the wood they went, on and on; on through moist shady glens,\nwhere everything was so peaceful, except for the cry of the falcon\nflying unseen in the heavens far above their heads; on again through\nthe thick brushwood, so thick that Reinhard must needs go on ahead to\nmake a track, here snapping off a branch, there bending aside a\ntrailing vine. But ere long he heard Elisabeth behind him calling out\nhis name. He turned round.\n\n\"Reinhard!\" she called, \"do wait for me! Reinhard!\"\n\nHe could not see her, but at length he caught sight of her some way\noff struggling with the undergrowth, her dainty head just peeping out\nover the tops of the ferns. So back he went once more and brought her\nout from the tangled mass of briar and brake into an open space where\nblue butterflies fluttered among the solitary wood blossoms.\n\nReinhard brushed the damp hair away from her heated face, and would\nhave tied the straw hat upon her head, but she refused; yet at his\nearnest request she consented after all.\n\n\"But where are your strawberries?\" she asked at length, standing still\nand drawing a deep breath.\n\n\"They were here,\" he said, \"but the toads have got here before us, or\nthe martens, or perhaps the fairies.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Elisabeth, \"the leaves are still here; but not a word\nabout fairies in this place. Come along, I'm not a bit tired yet; let\nus look farther on.\"\n\nIn front of them ran a little brook, and on the far side the wood\nbegan again. Reinhard raised Elisabeth in his arms and carried her\nover. After a while they emerged from the shady foliage and stood in a\nwide clearing.\n\n\"There must be strawberries here,\" said the girl, \"it all smells so\nsweet.\"\n\nThey searched about the sunny spot, but they found none. \"No,\" said\nReinhard, \"it is only the smell of the heather.\"\n\nEverywhere was a confusion of raspberry-bushes and holly, and the air\nwas filled with a strong smell of heather, patches of which alternated\nwith the short grass over these open spaces.\n\n\"How lonely it is here!\" said Elisabeth \"I wonder where the others\nare?\"\n\nReinhard had never thought of getting back.\n\n\"Wait a bit,\" he said, holding his hand aloft; \"where is the wind\ncoming from?\" But wind there was none.\n\n\"Listen!\" said Elisabeth, \"I think I heard them talking. Just give a\ncall in that direction.\"\n\nReinhard hollowed his hand and shouted: \"Come here!\"\n\n\"Here!\" was echoed back.\n\n\"They answered,\" cried Elisabeth clapping her hands.\n\n\"No, that was nothing; it was only the echo.\"\n\nElisabeth seized Reinhard's hand. \"I'm frightened!\" she said.\n\n\"Oh! no, you must not be frightened. It is lovely here. Sit down there\nin the shade among the long grass. Let us rest awhile: we'll find the\nothers soon enough.\"\n\nElisabeth sat down under the overhanging branch of a beech and\nlistened intently in every direction. Reinhard sat a few paces off on\na tree stump, and gazed over at her in silence.\n\nThe sun was just above their heads, shining with the full glare of\nmidday heat. Tiny, gold-flecked, steel-blue flies poised in the air\nwith vibrating wings. Their ears caught a gentle humming and buzzing\nall round them, and far away in the wood were heard now and again the\ntap-tap of the woodpecker and the screech of other birds.\n\n\"Listen,\" said Elisabeth, \"I hear a bell.\"\n\n\"Where?\" asked Reinhard.\n\n\"Behind us. Do you hear it? It is striking twelve o'clock.\"\n\n\"Then the town lies behind us, and if we go straight through in this\ndirection we are bound to fall in with the others.\"\n\nSo they started on their homeward way; they had given up looking for\nstrawberries, for Elisabeth had become tired. And at last there rang\nout from among the trees the laughing voices of the picnic party; then\nthey saw too a white cloth spread gleaming on the ground; it was the\nluncheon-table and on it were strawberries enough and to spare.\n\nThe old gentleman had a table-napkin tucked in his button-hole and was\ncontinuing his moral sermon to the young folks and vigorously carving\na joint of roast meat.\n\n\"Here come the stragglers,\" cried the young people when they saw\nReinhard and Elisabeth advancing among the trees.\n\n\"This way,\" shouted the old gentleman. \"Empty your handkerchiefs,\nupside down, with your hats! Now show us what you have found.\"\n\n\"Only hunger and thirst,\" said Reinhard.\n\n\"If that's all,\" replied the old man, lifting up and showing them the\nbowl full of fruit, \"you must keep what you've got. You remember the\nagreement: nothing here for lazybones to eat.\"\n\nBut in the end he was prevailed on to relent; the banquet proceeded,\nand a thrush in a juniper bush provided the music.\n\nSo the day passed. But Reinhard had, after all, found something, and\nthough it was not strawberries yet it was something that had grown in\nthe wood. When he got home this is what he wrote in his old\nparchment-bound volume:\n\n    Out on the hill-side yonder\n       The wind to rest is laid;\n     Under the drooping branches\n       There sits the little maid.\n\n    She sits among the wild thyme,\n       She sits in the fragrant air;\n    The blue flies hum around her,\n       Bright wings flash everywhere.\n\n    And through the silent woodland\n       She peers with watchful eyen,\n    While on her hazel ringlets\n       Sparkles the glad sunshine.\n\n    And far, far off the cuckoo\n       Laughs out his song.\n    I ween Hers are the bright, the golden\n       Eyes of the woodland queen.\n\nSo she was not only his little sweetheart, but was also the expression\nof all that was lovely and wonderful in his opening life.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nBY THE ROADSIDE THE CHILD STOOD\n\n\n\nThe time is Christmas Eve. Before the close of the afternoon Reinhard\nand some other students were sitting together at an old oak table in the\nRatskeller.[2]\n\n[2] The basement of the Rathaus or Town Hall. This, in almost every\nGerman town of importance, has become a restaurant and place of\nrefreshment.\n\nThe lamps on the wall were lighted, for down here in the basement it was\nalready growing dark; but there was only a thin sprinkling of customers\npresent, and the waiters were leaning idly up against the pillars let\ninto the walls.\n\nIn a corner of the vaulted room sat a fiddler and a fine-featured\ngipsy-girl with a zither; their instruments lay in their laps, and\nthey seemed to be looking about them with an air of indifference.\n\nA champagne cork popped off at the table occupied by the students.\n\"Drink, my gipsy darling!\" cried a young man of aristocratic\nappearance, holding out to the girl a glass full of wine.\n\n\"I don't care about it,\" she said, without altering her position.\n\n\"Well, then, give us a song,\" cried the young nobleman, and threw a\nsilver coin into her lap. The girl slowly ran her fingers through her\nblack hair while the fiddler whispered in her ear. But she threw back\nher head, and rested her chin on her zither.\n\n\"For him,\" she said, \"I'm not going to play.\"\n\nReinhard leapt up with his glass in his hand and stood in front of\nher.\n\n\"What do you want?\" she asked defiantly.\n\n\"To have a look at your eyes.\"\n\n\"What have my eyes to do with you?\"\n\nReinhard's glance flashed down on her. \"I _know_ they are false.\"\n\nShe laid her cheek in the palm of her hand and gave him a searching\nlook. Reinhard raised his glass to his mouth.\n\n\"Here's to your beautiful, wicked eyes!\" he said, and drank.\n\nShe laughed and tossed her head.\n\n\"Give it here,\" she said, and fastening her black eyes on his, she\nslowly drank what was left in the glass. Then she struck a chord and\nsang in a deep, passionate voice:\n\n    To-day, to-day thou think'st me\n       Fairest maid of all;\n    To-morrow, ah! then beauty\n       Fadeth past recall.\n    While the hour remaineth,\n       Thou art yet mine own;\n    Then when death shall claim me,\n       I must die alone.\n\nWhile the fiddler struck up an allegro finale, a new arrival joined\nthe group.\n\n\"I went to call for you, Reinhard,\" he said, \"You had already gone\nout, but Santa Claus had paid you a visit.\"\n\n\"Santa Claus?\" said Reinhard. \"Santa Claus never comes to me now.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, he does! The whole of your room smelt of Christmas tree and\nginger cakes.\"\n\nReinhard dropped the glass out of his hand and seized his cap.\n\n\"Well, what are you going to do now?\" asked the girl.\n\n\"I'll be back in a minute.\"\n\nShe frowned. \"Stay,\" she said gently, casting an amorous glance at\nhim.\n\nReinhard hesitated. \"I can't,\" he said.\n\nShe laughingly gave him a tap with the toe of her shoe and said: \"Go\naway, then, you good-for-nothing; you are one as bad as the other, all\ngood-for-nothings.\" And as she turned away from him, Reinhard went\nslowly up the steps of the Ratskeller.\n\nOutside in the street deep twilight had set in; he felt the cool\nwinter air blowing on his heated brow. From some window every here and\nthere fell the bright gleam of a Christmas tree all lighted up, now\nand then was heard from within some room the sound of little pipes and\ntin trumpets mingled with the merry din of children's voices.\n\nCrowds of beggar children were going from house to house or climbing\nup on to the railings of the front steps, trying to catch a glimpse\nthrough the window of a splendour that was denied to them. Sometimes\ntoo a door would suddenly be flung open, and scolding voices would\ndrive a whole swarm of these little visitors away out into the dark\nstreet. In the vestibule of yet another house they were singing an old\nChristmas carol, and little girls' clear voices were heard among the\nrest.\n\nBut Reinhard heard not; he passed quickly by them all, out of one\nstreet into another. When he reached his lodging it had grown almost\nquite dark; he stumbled up the stairs and so gained his apartment.\n\nA sweet fragrance greeted him; it reminded him of home; it was the\nsmell of the parlour in his mother's house at Christmas time. With\ntrembling hand he lit his lamp; and there lay a mighty parcel on the\ntable. When he opened it, out fell the familiar ginger cakes. On some\nof them were the initial letters of his name written in sprinkles of\nsugar; no one but Elisabeth could have done that.\n\nNext came to view a little parcel containing neatly embroidered linen,\nhandkerchiefs and cuffs; and finally letters from his mother and\nElisabeth. Reinhard opened Elisabeth's letter first, and this is what\nshe wrote:\n\n\"The pretty sugared letters will no doubt tell you who helped with the\ncakes. The same person also embroidered the cuffs for you. We shall\nhave a very quiet time at home this Christmas Eve. Mother always puts\nher spinning-wheel away in the corner as early as half-past nine. It\nis so very lonesome this winter now that you are not here.\n\n\"And now, too, the linnet you made me a present of died last Sunday.\nIt made me cry a good deal, though I am sure I looked after it well.\n\n\"It always used to sing of an afternoon when the sun shone on its\ncage. You remember how often mother would hang a piece of cloth over\nthe cage in order to keep it quiet when it sang so lustily.\n\n\"Thus our room is now quieter than ever, except that your old friend\nEric now drops in to see us occasionally. You told us once that he was\njust like his brown top-coat. I can't help thinking of it every time\nhe comes in at the door, and it is really too funny; but don't tell\nmother, it might easily make her angry.\n\n\"Guess what I am giving your mother for a Christmas present! You can't\nguess? Well, it is myself! Eric is making a drawing of me in black\nchalk; I have had to give him three sittings, each time for a whole\nhour.\n\n\"I simply loathed the idea of a stranger getting to know my face so\nwell. Nor did I wish it, but mother pressed me, and said it would very\nmuch please dear Frau Werner.\n\n\"But you are not keeping your word, Reinhard. You haven't sent me any\nstories. I have often complained to your mother about it, but she\nalways says you now have more to do than to attend to such childish\nthings. But I don't believe it; there's something else perhaps.\"\n\nAfter this Reinhard read his mother's letter, and when he had read\nthem both and slowly folded them up again and put them away, he was\novercome with an irresistible feeling of home-sickness. For a long\nwhile he walked up and down his room, talking softly to himself, and\nthen, under his breath, he murmured:\n\n    I have err'd from the straight path,\n      Bewildered I roam;\n    By the roadside the child stands\n      And beckons me home.\n\nThen he went to his desk, took out some money, and stepped down into\nthe street again. During all this while it had become quieter out\nthere; the lights on the Christmas trees had burnt out, the\nprocessions of children had come to an end. The wind was sweeping\nthrough the deserted streets; old and young alike were sitting\ntogether at home in family parties; the second period of Christmas Eve\ncelebrations had begun.\n\nAs Reinhard drew near the Ratskeller he heard from below the scraping\nof the fiddle and the singing of the zither girl. The restaurant door\nbell tinkled and a dark form staggered up the broad dimly-lighted\nstair.\n\nReinhard drew aside into the shadow of the houses and then passed\nswiftly by. After a while he reached the well-lighted shop of a\njeweller, and after buying a little cross studded with red corals, he\nreturned by the same way he had come.\n\nNot far from his lodgings he caught sight of a little girl, dressed in\nmiserable rags, standing before a tall door, in a vain attempt to open\nit.\n\n\"Shall I help you?\" he said.\n\nThe child gave no answer, but let go the massive door-handle. Reinhard\nhad soon opened the door.\n\n\"No,\" he said; \"they might drive you out again. Come along with me,\nand I'll give you some Christmas cake.\"\n\nHe then closed the door again and gave his hand to the little girl,\nwho walked along with him in silence to his lodgings.\n\nOn going out he had left the light burning.\n\n\"Here are some cakes for you,\" he said, pouring half of his whole\nstock into her apron, though he gave none that bore the sugar letters.\n\n\"Now, off you go home, and give your mother some of them too.\"\n\nThe child cast a shy look up at him; she seemed unaccustomed to such\nkindness and unable to say anything in reply. Reinhard opened the\ndoor, and lighted her way, and then the little thing like a bird flew\ndownstairs with her cakes and out of the house.\n\nReinhard poked the fire in the stove, set the dusty ink-stand on the\ntable, and then sat down and wrote and wrote letters the whole night\nlong to his mother and Elisabeth.\n\nThe remainder of the Christmas cakes lay untouched by his side, but he\nhad buttoned on Elisabeth's cuffs, and odd they looked on his shaggy\ncoat of undyed wool. And there he was still sitting when the winter\nsun cast its light on the frosted window-panes, and showed him a pale,\ngrave face reflected in the looking-glass.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nHOME\n\n\n\nWhen the Easter vacation came Reinhard journeyed home. On the morning\nafter his arrival he went to see Elisabeth.\n\n\"How tall you've grown,\" he said, as the pretty, slender girl advanced\nwith a smile to meet him. She blushed, but made no reply; he had taken\nher hand in his own in greeting, and she tried to draw it gently away.\nHe looked at her doubtingly, for never had she done that before; but\nnow it was as if some strange thing was coming between them.\n\nThe same feeling remained, too, after he had been at home for some\ntime and came to see her constantly day after day. When they sat alone\ntogether there ensued pauses in the conversation which distressed him,\nand which he anxiously did his best to avoid. In order to have a\ndefinite occupation during the holidays, he began to give Elisabeth\nsome instruction in botany, in which he himself had been keenly\ninterested during the early months of his university career.\n\nElisabeth, who was wont to follow him in all things and was moreover\nvery quick to learn, willingly entered into the proposal. So now\nseveral times in the week they made excursions into the fields or the\nmoors, and if by midday they brought home their green field-box full\nof plants and flowers, Reinhard would come again later in the day and\nshare with Elisabeth what they had collected in common.\n\nWith this same object in view, he entered the room one afternoon while\nElisabeth was standing by the window and sticking some fresh chick-weed\nin a gilded birdcage which he had not seen in the place before. In the\ncage was a canary, which was flapping its wings and shrilly chirruping\nas it pecked at Elisabeth's fingers. Previously to this Reinhard's bird\nhad hung in that spot.\n\n\"Has my poor linnet changed into a goldfinch after its death?\" he\nasked jovially.\n\n\"Linnets are not accustomed to do any such thing,\" said Elizabeth's\nmother, who sat spinning in her arm-chair. \"Your friend Eric sent it\nthis noon from his estate as a present for Elisabeth.\"\n\n\"What estate?\"\n\n\"Why, don't you know?\"\n\n\"Know what?\"\n\n\"That a month ago Eric took over his father's second estate by the\nImmensee.\"[3]\n\n[3] _i.e._ the 'Lake of the Bees'\n\n\"But you have never said a word to me about it.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the mother, \"you haven't yet made a single word of\ninquiry after your friend. He is a very nice, sensible young man.\"\n\nThe mother went out of the room to make the coffee. Elisabeth had her\nback turned to Reinhard, and was still busy with the making of her\nlittle chick-weed bower.\n\n\"Please, just a little longer,\" she said, \"I'll be done in a minute.\"\n\nAs Reinhard did not answer, contrary to his wont, she turned round and\nfaced him. In his eyes there was a sudden expression of trouble which\nshe had never observed before in them.\n\n\"What is the matter with you, Reinhard?\" she said, drawing nearer to\nhim.\n\n\"With me?\" he said, his thoughts far away and his eyes resting\ndreamily on hers.\n\n\"You look so sad.\"\n\n\"Elisabeth,\" he said, \"I cannot bear that yellow bird.\"\n\nShe looked at him in astonishment, without understanding his meaning.\n\"You are so strange,\" she said.\n\nHe took both her hands in his, and she let him keep them there. Her\nmother came back into the room shortly after; and after they had drunk\ntheir coffee she sat down at her spinning-wheel, while Reinhard and\nElisabeth went off into the next room to arrange their plants.\n\nStamens were counted, leaves and blossoms carefully opened out, and\ntwo specimens of each sort were laid to dry between the pages of a\nlarge folio volume.\n\nAll was calm and still this sunny afternoon; the only sounds to be\nheard were the hum of the mother's spinning-wheel in the next room,\nand now and then the subdued voice of Reinhard, as he named the orders\nof the families of the plants, and corrected Elisabeth's awkward\npronunciation of the Latin names.\n\n\"I am still short of that lily of the valley which I didn't get last\ntime,\" said she, after the whole collection had been classified and\narranged.\n\nReinhard pulled a little white vellum volume from his pocket. \"Here is\na spray of the lily of the valley for you,\" he said, taking out a\nhalf-pressed bloom.\n\nWhen Elisabeth saw the pages all covered with writing, she asked:\n\"Have you been writing stories again?\"\n\n\"These aren't stories,\" he answered, handing her the book.\n\nThe contents were all poems, and the majority of them at most filled\none page. Elisabeth turned over the leaves one after another; she\nappeared to be reading the titles only. \"When she was scolded by the\nteacher.\" \"When they lost their way in the woods.\" \"An Easter story.\"\n\"On her writing to me for the first time.\" Thus ran most of the\ntitles.\n\nReinhard fixed his eyes on her with a searching look, and as she kept\nturning over the leaves he saw that a gentle blush arose and gradually\nmantled over the whole of her sweet face. He would fain have looked\ninto her eyes, but Elisabeth did not look up, and finally laid the\nbook down before him without a word.\n\n\"Don't give it back like that,\" he said.\n\nShe took a brown spray out of the tin case. \"I will put your favourite\nflower inside,\" she said, giving back the book into his hands.\n\nAt length came the last day of the vacation and the morning of his\ndeparture. At her own request Elisabeth received permission from her\nmother to accompany her friend to the stage-coach, which had its\nstation a few streets from their house.\n\nWhen they passed out of the front door Reinhard gave her his arm, and\nthus he walked in silence side by side with the slender maiden. The\nnearer they came to their destination the more he felt as if he had\nsomething he must say to her before he bade her a long farewell,\nsomething on which all that was worthy and all that was sweet in his\nfuture life depended, and yet he could not formulate the saving word.\nIn his anguish, he walked slower and slower.\n\n\"You'll be too late,\" she said; \"it has already struck ten by St\nMary's clock.\"\n\nBut he did not quicken his pace for all that. At last he stammered\nout:\n\n\"Elisabeth, you will not see me again for two whole years. Shall I be\nas dear to you as ever when I come back?\"\n\nShe nodded, and looked affectionately into his face.\n\n\"I stood up for you too,\" she said, after a pause.\n\n\"Me? And against whom had you to stand up for me?\"\n\n\"Against my mother. We were talking about you a long time yesterday\nevening after you left. She thought you were not so nice now as you\nonce were.\"\n\nReinhard held his peace for a moment: then he took her hand in his,\nand looking gravely into her childish eyes, he said:\n\n\"I am still just as nice as I ever was; I would have you firmly\nbelieve that. Do you believe it, Elisabeth?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said.\n\nHe freed her hand and quickly walked with her through the last street.\nThe nearer he felt the time of parting approach, the happier became\nthe look on his face; he went almost too quickly for her.\n\n\"What is the matter with you, Reinhard?\" she asked.\n\n\"I have a secret, a beautiful secret,\" said Reinhard, looking at her\nwith a light in his eyes. \"When I come back again in two years' time,\nthen you shall know it.\"\n\nMeanwhile they had reached the stage-coach; they were only just in\ntime. Once more Reinhard took her hand. \"Farewell!\" he said,\n\"farewell, Elisabeth! Do not forget!\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"Farewell,\" she said. Reinhard climbed up into the\ncoach and the horses started. As the coach rumbled round the corner of\nthe street he saw her dear form once more as she slowly wended her way\nhome.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nA LETTER\n\n\n\nNearly two years later Reinhard was sitting by lamplight with his\nbooks and papers around him, expecting a friend with whom he used to\nstudy in common. Some one came upstairs. \"Come in.\" It was the\nlandlady. \"A letter for you, Herr Werner,\" and she went away.\n\nReinhard had never written to Elisabeth since his visit home, and he\nhad received no letter from her. Nor was this one from her; it was in\nhis mother's handwriting.\n\nReinhard broke the seal and read, and ere long he came to this\nparagraph:\n\n\"At your time of life, my dear boy, nearly every year still brings its\nown peculiar experience; for youth is apt to turn everything to the\nbest account. At home, too, things have changed very much, and all\nthis will, I fear, cause you much pain at first, if my understanding\nof you is at all correct.\n\n\"Yesterday Eric was at last accepted by Elisabeth, after having twice\nproposed in vain during the last three months. She had never been able\nto make up her mind to it, but now in the end she has done so. To my\nmind she is still far too young. The wedding is to take place soon,\nand her mother means to go away with them.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nIMMENSEE\n\n\n\nAgain years have passed. One warm afternoon in spring a young man,\nwhose sunburnt face was the picture of health, was walking along a\nshady road through the wood leading down to the valley below.\n\nHis grave dark eyes looked intently into the distance, as though he\nwas expecting to find every moment some change in the monotony of the\nroad, a change however which seemed reluctant to come about. At length\nhe saw a cart slowly coming up from below.\n\n\"Hullo! my friend,\" shouted the traveller to the farmer, who was\nwalking by the side of the cart, \"is this the right road to Immensee?\"\n\n\"Yes, straight on,\" answered the man touching his slouch hat.\n\n\"Is it still far off?\"\n\n\"You are close to the place, sir. In less time than it takes to smoke\nhalf a pipe of tobacco you'll be at the lake side, and the manor is\nhard by.\"\n\nThe farmer passed on while the other quickened his pace as he went\nalong under the trees. After a quarter of an hour's walk the shade to\nthe left of him suddenly came to an end; the road led along a steep\nslope from which the ancient oaks growing below hardly reared their\ntopmost branches.\n\nAway over their crests opened out a broad, sunny landscape. Far below\nlay the peaceful, dark-blue lake, almost entirely surrounded by green\nsun-lit woods, save where on one spot they divided and afforded an\nextensive view until it closed in the distant blue mountains.\n\nStraight opposite, in the middle of all this forest verdure, there lay\na patch of white, like driven snow. This was an expanse of blossoming\nfruit-trees, and out of them, up on the high lake shore, rose the\nmanor-house, shining white, with tiles of red. A stork flew up from\nthe chimney, and circled slowly above the waters.\n\n\"Immensee!\" exclaimed the traveller.\n\nIt almost seemed as if he had now reached the end of his journey, for\nhe stood motionless, looking out over the tops of the trees at his\nfeet, and gazing at the farther shore, where the reflection of the\nmanor-house floated, rocking gently, on the bosom of the water. Then\nhe suddenly started on his way again.\n\nHis road now led almost steeply down the mountain-side, so that the\ntrees that had once stood below him again gave him their shade, but at\nthe same time cut off from him the view of the lake, which only now\nand then peeped out between the gaps in the branches.\n\nSoon the way went gently upwards again, and to left and right the\nwoods disappeared, yielding place to vine-clad hills stretching along\nthe pathway; while on either side stood fruit-trees in blossom, filled\nwith the hum of the bees as they busily pried into the blossoms. A\ntall man wearing a brown overcoat advanced to meet the traveller. When\nhe had almost come up to him, he waved his cap and cried out in a loud\nvoice:\n\n\"Welcome, welcome, brother Reinhard! Welcome to my Immensee estate!\"\n\n\"God's greeting to you[4], Eric, and thank you for\nyour welcome,\" replied the other.\n\n[4] This form of salutation is especially common in the south of\nGermany.\n\nBy this time they had come up close to one another, and clasped hands.\n\n\"And is it really you?\" said Eric, when he at last got a near sight of\nthe grave face of his old school-fellow.\n\n\"It is I right enough, Eric, and I recognize you too; only you almost\nlook cheerier than you ever did before.\"\n\nAt these words a glad smile made Eric's plain features all the more\ncheerful.\n\n\"Yes, brother Reinhard,\" he said, as he once more held out his hand to\nhim, \"but since those days, you see, I have won the great prize; but\nyou know that well enough.\"\n\nThen he rubbed his hands and cried cheerily: \"This _will_ be a\nsurprise! You are the last person she expects to see.\"\n\n\"A surprise?\" asked Reinhard. \"For whom, pray?\"\n\n\"Why, for Elisabeth.\"\n\n\"Elisabeth! You haven't told her a word about my visit?\"\n\n\"Not a word, brother Reinhard; she has no thought of you, nor her\nmother either. I invited you entirely on the quiet, in order that the\npleasure might be all the greater. You know I always had little quiet\nschemes of my own.\"\n\nReinhard turned thoughtful; he seemed to breathe more heavily the\nnearer they approached the house.\n\nOn the left side of the road the vineyards came to an end, and gave\nplace to an extensive kitchen-garden, which reached almost as far as\nthe lake-shore. The stork had meanwhile come to earth and was striding\nsolemnly between the vegetable beds.\n\n\"Hullo!\" cried Eric, clapping his hands together, \"if that long-legged\nEgyptian isn't stealing my short pea-sticks again!\"\n\nThe bird slowly rose and flew on to the roof of a new building, which\nran along the end of the kitchen-garden, and whose walls were covered\nwith the branches of the peach and apricot trees that were trained\nover them.\n\n\"That's the distillery,\" said Eric. \"I built it only two years ago. My\nlate father had the farm buildings rebuilt; the dwelling-house was\nbuilt as far back as my grandfather's time. So we go ever forward a\nlittle bit at a time.\"\n\nTalking thus they came to a wide, open space, enclosed at the sides by\nfarm-buildings, and in the rear by the manor-house, the two wings of\nwhich were connected by a high garden wall. Behind this wall ran dark\nhedges of yew trees, while here and there syringa trees trailed their\nblossoming branches over into the courtyard.\n\nMen with faces scorched by the sun and heated with toil were walking\nover the open space and gave a greeting to the two friends, while Eric\ncalled out to one or another of them some order or question about\ntheir day's work.\n\nBy this time they had reached the house. They entered a high, cool\nvestibule, at the far end of which they turned to the left into a\nsomewhat darker passage.\n\nHere Eric opened a door and they passed into a spacious room that\nopened into a garden. The heavy mass of leafage that covered the\nopposite windows filled this room at either end with a green twilight,\nwhile between the windows two lofty wide-open folding-doors let in the\nfull glow of spring sunshine, and afforded a view into a garden, laid\nout with circular flower-beds and steep hedgerows and divided by a\nstraight, broad path, along which the eye roamed out on to the lake\nand away over the woods growing on the opposite shore.\n\nAs the two friends entered, a breath of wind bore in upon them a\nperfect stream of fragrance.\n\nOn a terrace in front of the door leading to the garden sat a girlish\nfigure dressed in white. She rose and came to meet the two friends as\nthey entered, but half-way she stood stock-still as if rooted to the\nspot and stared at the stranger. With a smile he held out his hand to\nher.\n\n\"Reinhard!\" she cried. \"Reinhard! Oh! is it you? It is such a long\ntime since we have seen each other.\"\n\n\"Yes, a long time,\" he said, and not a word more could he utter; for\non hearing her voice he felt a keen, physical pain at his heart, and\nas he looked up to her, there she stood before him, the same slight,\ngraceful figure to whom he had said farewell years ago in the town\nwhere he was born.\n\nEric had stood back by the door, with joy beaming from his eyes.\n\n\"Now, then, Elisabeth,\" he said, \"isn't he really the very last person\nin the world you would have expected to see?\"\n\nElisabeth looked at him with the eyes of a sister. \"You are so kind,\nEric,\" she said.\n\nHe took her slender hand caressingly in his. \"And now that we have\nhim,\" he said, \"we shall not be in a hurry to let him go. He has been\nso long away abroad, we will try to make him feel at home again. Just\nsee how foreign-looking he has become, and what a distinguished\nappearance he has!\"\n\nElisabeth shyly scanned Reinhard's face. \"The time that we have been\nseparated is enough to account for that,\" she said.\n\nAt this moment in at the door came her mother, key-basket on arm.\n\n\"Herr Werner!\" she cried, when she caught sight of Reinhard; \"ah! you\nare as dearly welcome as you are unexpected.\"\n\nAnd so the conversation went smoothly on with questions and answers.\nThe ladies sat over their work, and while Reinhard enjoyed the\nrefreshment that had been prepared for him, Eric had lighted his huge\nmeerschaum pipe and sat smoking and conversing by his side.\n\nNext day Reinhard had to go out with him to see the fields, the\nvineyards, the hop-garden, the distillery. It was all well appointed;\nthe people who were working on the land or at the vats all had a\nhealthy and contented look.\n\nFor dinner the family assembled in the room that opened into the\ngarden, and the day was spent more or less in company just according\nto the leisure of the host and hostess. Only during the hours\npreceding the evening meal, as also during the early hours of the\nforenoon, did Reinhard stay working in his own room.\n\nFor some years past, whenever he could come across them, he had been\ncollecting the rhymes and songs that form part of the life of the\npeople, and now set about arranging his treasure, and wherever\npossible increasing it by means of fresh records from the immediate\nneighbourhood.\n\nElisabeth was at all times gentle and kind. Eric's constant attentions\nshe received with an almost humble gratitude, and Reinhard thought at\nwhiles that the gay, cheerful child of bygone days had given promise\nof a somewhat less sedate womanhood.\n\nEver since the second day of his visit he had been wont of an evening\nto take a walk along the shore of the lake. The road led along close\nunder the garden. At the end of the latter, on a projecting mound,\nthere was a bench under some tall birch trees. Elisabeth's mother had\nchristened it the Evening Bench, because the spot faced westward, and\nwas mostly used at that time of the day in order to enjoy a view of\nthe sunset.\n\nOne evening Reinhard was returning from his walk along this road when\nhe was overtaken by the rain. He sought shelter under one of the\nlinden trees that grew by the water-side, but the heavy drops were\nsoon pelting through the leaves. Wet through as he was he resigned\nhimself to his fate and slowly continued his homeward way.\n\nIt was almost dark; the rain fell faster and faster. As he drew near\nto the Evening Bench he fancied he could make out the figure of a\nwoman dressed in white standing among the gleaming birch tree trunks.\nShe stood motionless, and, as far as he could make out on approaching\nnearer, with her face turned in his direction, as if she was expecting\nsome one.\n\nHe thought it was Elisabeth. But when he quickened his pace in order\nthat he might catch up to her and then return together with her\nthrough the garden into the house, she turned slowly away and\ndisappeared among the dark side-paths.\n\nHe could not understand it; he was almost angry with Elisabeth, and yet\nhe doubted whether it had really been she. He was, however, shy of\nquestioning her about it--nay, he even avoided going into the\ngarden-room on his return to the house for fear he should happen to see\nElisabeth enter through the garden-door.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nBY MY MOTHER'S HARD DECREE\n\n\n\nSome days later, as evening was already closing in, the family was, as\nusual at this time of the day, sitting all together in their\ngarden-room. The doors stood wide open, and the sun had already sunk\nbehind the woods on the far side of the lake.\n\nReinhard was invited to read some folk-songs which had been sent to\nhim that afternoon by a friend who lived away in the country. He went\nup to his room and soon returned with a roll of papers which seemed to\nconsist of detached neatly written pages.\n\nSo they all sat down to the table, Elisabeth beside Reinhard. \"We\nshall read them at random,\" said the latter, \"I have not yet looked\nthrough them myself.\"\n\nElisabeth unrolled the manuscript. \"Here's some music,\" she said, \"you\nmust sing it, Reinhard.\"\n\nTo begin with he read some Tyrolese ditties[5] and as he read on he\nwould now and then hum one or other of the lively melodies. A general\nfeeling of cheeriness pervaded the little party.\n\n[5] Dialectal for _Schnitterh\u00c3\u00bcpfen_, _i.e._ 'reapers' dances,' sung\nespecially in the Tyrol and in Bavaria.\n\n\"And who, pray, made all these pretty songs?\" asked Elisabeth.\n\n\"Oh,\" said Eric, \"you can tell that by listening to the rubbishy\nthings--tailors' apprentices and barbers and such-like merry folk.\"\n\nReinhard said: \"They are not made; they grow, they drop from the clouds,\nthey float over the land like gossamer, hither and thither, and are sung\nin a thousand places at the same time.[6] We discover in these songs our\nvery inmost activities and sufferings: it is as if we all had helped to\nwrite them.\"\n\n[6] These fine cobwebs, produced by field-spiders, have always in the\npopular mind been connected with the gods. After the advent of\nChristianity they were connected with the Virgin Mary. The shroud in\nwhich she was wrapped after her death was believed to have been woven of\nthe very finest thread, which during her ascent to Heaven frayed away\nfrom her body.\n\nHe took up another sheet: \"I stood on the mountain height...\"[7]\n\n[7] An ancient folk-song which treats of a beautiful but poor maiden,\nwho, being unable to marry 'the young count,' retired to a convent.\n\n\"I know that one,\" cried Elisabeth; \"begin it, do, Reinhard, and I\nwill help you out.\"\n\nSo they sang that famous melody, which is so mysterious that one can\nhardly believe that it was ever conceived by the heart of man,\nElisabeth with her slightly clouded contralta taking the second part\nto the young man's tenor.\n\nThe mother meanwhile sat busy with her needlework, while Eric listened\nattentively, with one hand clasped in the other. The song finished,\nReinhard laid the sheet on one side in silence. Up from the lake-shore\ncame through the evening calm the tinkle of the cattle bells; they\nwere all listening without knowing why, and presently they heard a\nboy's clear voice singing:\n\n    I stood on the mountain height\n    And viewed the deep valley beneath....\n\nReinhard smiled. \"Do you hear that now? So it passes from mouth to\nmouth.\"\n\n\"It is often sung in these parts,\" said Elisabeth.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Eric, \"it is Casper the herdsman; he is driving the heifers\nhome.\"[8]\n\n[8] _Starke_ is the southern dialect word for _F\u00c3\u00a4rse_, 'young cow,'\n'heifer.'\n\nThey listened a while longer until the tinkle of the bells died away\nbehind the farm buildings. \"These melodies are as old as the world,\"\nsaid Reinhard; \"they slumber in the depths of the forest; God knows\nwho discovered them.\"\n\nHe drew forth a fresh sheet.\n\nIt had now grown darker; a crimson evening glow lay like foam over the\nwoods in the farther side of the lake. Reinhard unrolled the sheet,\nElisabeth caught one side of it in her hand, and they both examined it\ntogether. Then Reinhard read:\n\n    By my mother's hard decree\n    Another's wife I needs must be;\n    Him on whom my heart was set,\n    Him, alas! I must forget;\n    My heart protesting, but not free.\n\n    Bitterly did I complain\n    That my mother brought me pain.\n    What mine honour might have been,\n    That is turned to deadly sin.\n    Can I ever hope again?\n\n    For my pride what can I show,\n    And my joy, save grief and woe?\n    Oh! could I undo what's done,\n    O'er the moor scorched by the sun\n    Beggarwise I'd gladly go.\n\nDuring the reading of this Reinhard had felt an imperceptible\nquivering of the paper; and when he came to an end Elisabeth gently\npushed her chair back and passed silently out into the garden. Her\nmother followed her with a look. Eric made as if to go after, but the\nmother said:\n\n\"Elisabeth has one or two little things to do outside,\" so he remained\nwhere he was.\n\nBut out of doors the evening brooded darker and darker over garden and\nlake. Moths whirred past the open doors through which the fragrance of\nflower and bush floated in increasingly; up from the water came the\ncroak of the frogs, under the windows a nightingale commenced his song\nanswered by another from within the depths of the garden; the moon\nappeared over the tree-tops.\n\nReinhard looked for a little while longer at the spot where\nElisabeth's sweet form had been lost to sight in the thick-foliaged\ngarden paths, and then he rolled up his manuscript, bade his friends\ngood-night and passed through the house down to the water.\n\nThe woods stood silent and cast their dark shadow far out over the\nlake, while the centre was bathed in the haze of a pale moonlight. Now\nand then a gentle rustle trembled through the trees, though wind there\nwas none; it was but the breath of summer night.\n\nReinhard continued along the shore. A stone's throw from the land he\nperceived a white water-lily. All at once he was seized with the\ndesire to see it quite close, so he threw off his clothes and entered\nthe water. It was quite shallow; sharp stones and water plants cut his\nfeet, and yet he could not reach water deep enough for him to swim in.\n\nThen suddenly he stepped out of his depth: the waters swirled above\nhim; and it was some time before he rose to the surface again. He\nstruck out with hands and feet and swam about in a circle until he had\nmade quite sure from what point he had entered the water. And soon too\nhe saw the lily again floating lonely among the large, gleaming\nleaves.\n\nHe swam slowly out, lifting every now and then his arms out of the\nwater so that the drops trickled down and sparkled in the moonlight.\nYet the distance between him and the flower showed no signs of\ndiminishing, while the shore, as he glanced back at it, showed behind\nhim in a hazy mist that ever deepened. But he refused to give up the\nventure and vigorously continued swimming in the same direction.\n\nAt length he had come so near the flower that he was able clearly to\ndistinguish the silvery leaves in the moonlight; but at the same time\nhe felt himself entangled in a net formed by the smooth stems of the\nwater plants which swayed up from the bottom and wound themselves\nround his naked limbs.\n\nThe unfamiliar water was black all round about him, and behind him he\nheard the sound of a fish leaping. Suddenly such an uncanny feeling\noverpowered him in the midst of this strange element that with might\nand main he tore asunder the network of plants and swam back to land\nin breathless haste. And when from the shore he looked back upon the\nlake, there floated the lily on the bosom of the darkling water as far\naway and as lonely as before.\n\nHe dressed and slowly wended his way home. As he passed out of the\ngarden into the room he discovered Eric and the mother busied with\npreparations for a short journey which had to be undertaken for\nbusiness purposes on the morrow.\n\n\"Where ever have you been so late in the dark?\" the mother called out\nto him.\n\n\"I?\" he answered, \"oh, I wanted to pay a call on the water-lily, but I\nfailed.\"\n\n\"That's beyond the comprehension of any man,\" said Eric. \"What on\nearth had you to do with the water-lily?\"\n\n\"Oh, I used to be friends with the lily once,\" said Reinhard; \"but\nthat was long ago.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nELISABETH\n\n\n\nThe following afternoon Reinhard and Elisabeth went for a walk on the\nfarther side of the lake, strolling at times through the woodland, at\nother times along the shore where it jutted out into the water.\nElisabeth had received injunctions from Eric, during the absence of\nhimself and her mother to show Reinhard the prettiest views in the\nimmediate neighbourhood, particularly the view toward the farm itself\nfrom the other side of the lake. So now they proceeded from one point\nto another.\n\nAt last Elisabeth got tired and sat down in the shade of some\noverhanging branches. Reinhard stood opposite to her, leaning against\na tree trunk; and as he heard the cuckoo calling farther back in the\nwoods, it suddenly struck him that all this had happened once before.\nHe looked at her and with an odd smile asked:\n\n\"Shall we look for strawberries?\"\n\n\"It isn't strawberry time,\" she said.\n\n\"No, but it will soon be here.\"\n\nElisabeth shook her head in silence; then she rose and the two\nstrolled on together. And as they wandered side by side, his eyes ever\nand again were bent toward her; for she walked gracefully and her step\nwas light. He often unconsciously fell back a pace in order that he\nmight feast his eyes on a full view of her.\n\nSo they came to an open space overgrown with heather where the view\nextended far over the country-side. Reinhard bent down and plucked a\nbloom from one of the little plants that grew at his feet. When he\nlooked up again there was an expression of deep pain on his face.\n\n\"Do you know this flower?\" he asked.\n\nShe gave him a questioning look. \"It is an erica. I have often\ngathered them in the woods.\"\n\n\"I have an old book at home,\" he said; \"I once used to write in it all\nsorts of songs and rhymes, but that is all over and done with long\nsince. Between its leaves also there is an erica, but it is only a\nfaded one. Do you know who gave it me?\"\n\nShe nodded without saying a word; but she cast down her eyes and fixed\nthem on the bloom which he held in his hand. For a long time they\nstood thus. When she raised her eyes on him again he saw that they\nwere brimming over with tears.\n\n\"Elisabeth,\" he said, \"behind yonder blue hills lies our youth. What\nhas become of it?\"\n\nNothing more was spoken. They walked dumbly by each other's side down\nto the lake. The air was sultry; to westward dark clouds were rising.\n\"There's going to be a storm,\" said Elisabeth, hastening her steps.\nReinhard nodded in silence, and together they rapidly sped along the\nshore till they reached their boat.\n\nOn the way across Elisabeth rested her hand on the gunwale of the\nboat. As he rowed Reinhard glanced along at her, but she gazed past\nhim into the distance. And so his glance fell downward and rested on\nher hand, and the white hand betrayed to him what her lips had failed\nto reveal.\n\nIt revealed those fine traces of secret pain that so readily mark a\nwoman's fair hands, when they lie at nights folded across an aching\nheart. And as Elisabeth felt his glance resting on her hand she let it\nslip gently over the gunwale into the water.\n\nOn arriving at the farm they fell in with a scissors grinder's cart\nstanding in front of the manor-house. A man with black, loosely-flowing\nhair was busily plying his wheel and humming a gipsy melody between his\nteeth, while a dog that was harnessed to the cart lay panting hard by.\nOn the threshold stood a girl dressed in rags, with features of faded\nbeauty, and with outstretched hand she asked alms of Elisabeth.\n\nReinhard thrust his hand into his pocket, but Elisabeth was before\nhim, and hastily emptied the entire contents of her purse into the\nbeggar's open palm. Then she turned quickly away, and Reinhard heard\nher go sobbing up the stairs.\n\nHe would fain have detained her, but he changed his mind and remained\nat the foot of the stairs. The beggar girl was still standing at the\ndoorway, motionless, and holding in her hand the money she had\nreceived.\n\n\"What more do you want?\" asked Reinhard.\n\nShe gave a sudden start: \"I want nothing more,\" she said; then,\nturning her head toward him and staring at him with wild eyes, she\npassed slowly out of the door. He uttered a name, but she heard him\nnot; with drooping head, with arms folded over her breast, she walked\ndown across the farmyard:\n\n    Then when death shall claim me,\n       I must die alone.\n\nAn old song surged in Reinhard's ears, he gasped for breath; a little\nwhile only, and then he turned away and went up to his chamber.\n\nHe sat down to work, but his thoughts were far afield. After an hour's\nvain attempt he descended to the parlour. Nobody was in it, only cool,\ngreen twilight; on Elisabeth's work-table lay a red ribbon which she\nhad worn round her neck during the afternoon. He took it up in his\nhand, but it hurt him, and he laid it down again.\n\nHe could find no rest. He walked down to the lake and untied the boat.\nHe rowed over the water and trod once again all the paths which he and\nElisabeth had paced together but a short hour ago. When he got back\nhome it was dark. At the farm he met the coachman, who was about to\nturn the carriage horses out into the pasture; the travellers had just\nreturned.\n\nAs he came into the entrance hall he heard Eric pacing up and down the\ngarden-room. He did not go in to him; he stood still for a moment, and\nthen softly climbed the stairs and so to his own room. Here he sat in\nthe arm-chair by the window. He made himself believe that he was\nlistening to the nightingale's throbbing music in the garden hedges\nbelow, but what he heard was the throbbing of his own heart.\nDownstairs in the house every one went to bed, the night-hours passed,\nbut he paid no heed.\n\nFor hours he sat thus, till at last he rose and leaned out of the open\nwindow. The dew was dripping among the leaves, the nightingale had\nceased to trill. By degrees the deep blue of the darksome sky was\nchased away by a faint yellow gleam that came from the east; a fresh\nwind rose and brushed Reinhard's heated brow; the early lark soared\ntriumphant up into the sky.\n\nReinhard suddenly turned and stepped up to the table. He groped about\nfor a pencil and when he had found one he sat down and wrote a few\nlines on a sheet of white paper. Having finished his writing he took\nup hat and stick, and leaving the paper behind him, carefully opened\nthe door and descended to the vestibule.\n\nThe morning twilight yet brooded in every corner; the big house-cat\nstretched its limbs on the straw mat and arched its back against\nReinhard's hand, which he unthinkingly held out to it. Outside in the\ngarden the sparrows were already chirping their patter from among the\nbranches, and giving notice to all that the night was now past.[9]\n\n[9] Literally, \"sang out pompously, like priests.\" The word seems to\nhave been coined by the author. The English 'patter' is derived from\n_Pater noster_, and seems an appropriate translation.\n\nThen within the house he heard a door open on the upper floor; some\none came downstairs, and on looking up he saw Elisabeth standing\nbefore him. She laid her hand upon his arm, her lips moved, but not a\nword did he hear.\n\nPresently she said: \"You will never come back. I know it; do not deny\nit; you will never come back.\"\n\n\"No, never,\" he said.\n\nShe let her hand fall from his arm and said no more. He crossed the\nhall to the door, then turned once more. She was standing motionless\non the same spot and looking at him with lifeless eyes. He advanced\none step and opened his arms toward her; then, with a violent effort,\nhe turned away and so passed out of the door.\n\nOutside the world lay bathed in morning light, the drops of pearly dew\ncaught on the spiders' webs glistened in the first rays of the rising\nsun. He never looked back; he walked rapidly onward; behind him the\npeaceful farmstead gradually disappeared from view as out in front of\nhim rose the great wide world.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nTHE OLD MAN\n\n\n\nThe moon had ceased to shine in through the window-panes, and it had\ngrown quite dark; but the old man still sat in his arm-chair with\nfolded hands and gazed before him into the emptiness of the room.\n\nGradually, the murky darkness around him dissolved away before his\neyes and changed into a broad dark lake; one black wave after another\nwent rolling on farther and farther, and on the last one, so far away\nas to be almost beyond the reach of the old man's vision, floated\nlonely among its broad leaves a white water-lily.\n\nThe door opened, and a bright glare of light filled the room.\n\n\"I am glad that you have come, Bridget,\" said the old man. \"Set the\nlamp upon the table.\"\n\nThen he drew his chair up to the table, took one of the open books and\nburied himself in studies to which he had once applied all the\nstrength of his youth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Immensee, by Theodore W.

Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1383,"split":"test"}
