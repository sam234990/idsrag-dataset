Ralph buys a wife for himself - a girl named Jocelyn Leigh - little knowing that she is the escaping ward of King James I, fleeing a forced marriage to Lord Carnal. Jocelyn hardly loves Ralph - indeed, she seems to abhor him. Carnal, Jocelyn's husband-to-be, eventually comes to Jamestown, unaware that Ralph Percy and Jocelyn Leigh are man and wife.\nLord Carnal attempts to kidnap Jocelyn several times and eventually follows Ralph, Jocelyn, and their two companions - Jeremy Sparrow, the Separatist minister, and Diccon, Ralph's servant - as they escape from the King's orders to arrest Ralph and carry Jocelyn back to England. The boat they are in, however, crashes on a desert island, but they are accosted by pirates, who, after a short struggle, agree to take Ralph as their captain, after he pretends to be the pirate \"Kirby\". The pirates gleefully play on with Ralph's masquerade, until he refuses to allow them to rape and pillage those aboard Spanish ships.\nThe play is up when the pirates see an English ship off the coast of Florida. Ralph refuses to fire upon it, knowing it carries the new Virginian governor, Sir Francis Wyatt, but the pirates open fire, and Jeremy Sparrow, before the English ship can be destroyed, purposefully crashes the ship into a reef. The pirates are all killed, but the Englishmen (and woman) are rescued by the Governor's ship.\nAboard the ship, Ralph is tried for piracy after Lord Carnal tells the Governor that he ordered the destruction of the ship, but Jocelyn, having come to love Ralph, speaks for him. Her words are so persuasive that the Governor believes her and frees Ralph. They return to Virginia, though Ralph is forced to remain in a gaol - King's orders.\nRalph is lured into a trap, though, by Lord Carnal and is subsequently captured by Indians - but not before putting up a fight and seeing Lord Carnal terribly wounded. The brother of Pocahontas, the Indian Nantauquas, rescues him and Diccon, but only to inform them that all the Virginian Indians plan to massacre the Jamestown settlers. As they are on their way back to Jamestown, Diccon is shot and killed by a hostile Indian, and Ralph is left alone to brave his way back. Returning to the colony, he gives his information, only to be told that Jocelyn had made her way to the forest in search of him after his absence was noticed, with Jeremy Sparrow, and that they had not been found. It is also discovered that Lord Carnal has taken poison and will die within a week.\nJamestown is saved, thanks to Ralph's almost-too-late warning, and after things are stabilized, Ralph goes in search of Jocelyn and the minister. After a long and seemingly fruitless search, Nantauquas himself, though he had turned traitor, leads Ralph to where Jocelyn is staying. The two are reunited, and at the end of the story intend to go to England, where Jocelyn's lands have been restored to her and they can finally live in peace.\nTo Have and to Hold was revised and edited by Josh and Sarah Wean for the four-hundredth anniversary of the founding of Jamestown.

Death is not more still\nthan is this Virginian land in the hour when the sun has sunk away, and\nit is black beneath the trees, and the stars brighten slowly and softly,\none by one. The birds that sing all day have hushed, and the horned\nowls, the monster frogs, and that strange and ominous fowl (if fowl it\nbe, and not, as some assert, a spirit damned) which we English call the\nwhippoorwill, are yet silent. Later the wolf will howl and the panther\nscream, but now there is no sound. The winds are laid, and the restless\nleaves droop and are quiet. The low lap of the water among the reeds is\nlike the breathing of one who sleeps in his watch beside the dead.\n\nI marked the light die from the broad bosom of the river, leaving it\na dead man's hue. Awhile ago, and for many evenings, it had been\ncrimson,--a river of blood. A week before, a great meteor had shot\nthrough the night, blood-red and bearded, drawing a slow-fading fiery\ntrail across the heavens; and the moon had risen that same night\nblood-red, and upon its disk there was drawn in shadow a thing most\nmarvelously like a scalping knife. Wherefore, the following day being\nSunday, good Mr. Stockham, our minister at Weyanoke, exhorted us to be\non our guard, and in his prayer besought that no sedition or rebellion\nmight raise its head amongst the Indian subjects of the Lord's anointed.\nAfterward, in the churchyard, between the services, the more timorous\nbegan to tell of divers portents which they had observed, and to recount\nold tales of how the savages distressed us in the Starving Time. The\nbolder spirits laughed them to scorn, but the women began to weep and\ncower, and I, though I laughed too, thought of Smith, and how he ever\nheld the savages, and more especially that Opechancanough who was now\ntheir emperor, in a most deep distrust; telling us that the red men\nwatched while we slept, that they might teach wiliness to a Jesuit, and\nhow to bide its time to a cat crouched before a mousehole. I thought\nof the terms we now kept with these heathen; of how they came and went\nfamiliarly amongst us, spying out our weakness, and losing the salutary\nawe which that noblest captain had struck into their souls; of how many\nwere employed as hunters to bring down deer for lazy masters; of how,\nbreaking the law, and that not secretly, we gave them knives and arms, a\nsoldier's bread, in exchange for pelts and pearls; of how their emperor\nwas forever sending us smooth messages; of how their lips smiled\nand their eyes frowned. That afternoon, as I rode home through the\nlengthening shadows, a hunter, red-brown and naked, rose from behind a\nfallen tree that sprawled across my path, and made offer to bring me my\nmeat from the moon of corn to the moon of stags in exchange for a gun.\nThere was scant love between the savages and myself,--it was answer\nenough when I told him my name. I left the dark figure standing, still\nas a carved stone, in the heavy shadow of the trees, and, spurring my\nhorse (sent me from home, the year before, by my cousin Percy), was soon\nat my house,--a poor and rude one, but pleasantly set upon a slope of\ngreen turf, and girt with maize and the broad leaves of the tobacco.\nWhen I had had my supper, I called from their hut the two Paspahegh lads\nbought by me from their tribe the Michaelmas before, and soundly flogged\nthem both, having in my mind a saying of my ancient captain's, namely,\n\"He who strikes first oft-times strikes last.\"\n\nUpon the afternoon of which I now speak, in the midsummer of the year of\ngrace 1621, as I sat upon my doorstep, my long pipe between my teeth and\nmy eyes upon the pallid stream below, my thoughts were busy with these\nmatters,--so busy that I did not see a horse and rider emerge from the\ndimness of the forest into the cleared space before my palisade, nor\nknew, until his voice came up the bank, that my good friend, Master John\nRolfe, was without and would speak to me.\n\nI went down to the gate, and, unbarring it, gave him my hand and led the\nhorse within the inclosure.\n\n\"Thou careful man!\" he said, with a laugh, as he dismounted. \"Who else,\nthink you, in this or any other hundred, now bars his gate when the sun\ngoes down?\"\n\n\"It is my sunset gun,\" I answered briefly, fastening his horse as I\nspoke.\n\nHe put his arm about my shoulder, for we were old friends, and together\nwe went up the green bank to the house, and, when I had brought him a\npipe, sat down side by side upon the doorstep.\n\n\"Of what were you dreaming?\" he asked presently, when we had made for\nourselves a great cloud of smoke. \"I called you twice.\"\n\n\"I was wishing for Dale's times and Dale's laws.\"\n\nHe laughed, and touched my knee with his hand, white and smooth as a\nwoman's, and with a green jewel upon the forefinger.\n\n\"Thou Mars incarnate!\" he cried. \"Thou first, last, and in the meantime\nsoldier! Why, what wilt thou do when thou gettest to heaven? Make it too\nhot to hold thee? Or take out letters of marque against the Enemy?\"\n\n\"I am not there yet,\" I said dryly. \"In the meantime I would like a\ncommission against--your relatives.\"\n\nHe laughed, then sighed, and, sinking his chin into his hand and softly\ntapping his foot against the ground, fell into a reverie.\n\n\"I would your princess were alive,\" I said presently.\n\n\"So do I,\" he answered softly. \"So do I.\" Locking his hands behind his\nhead, he raised his quiet face to the evening star. \"Brave and wise and\ngentle,\" he mused. \"If I did not think to meet her again, beyond that\nstar, I could not smile and speak calmly, Ralph, as I do now.\"\n\n\"'T is a strange thing,\" I said, as I refilled my pipe. \"Love for your\nbrother-in-arms, love for your commander if he be a commander worth\nhaving, love for your horse and dog, I understand. But wedded love! to\ntie a burden around one's neck because 't is pink and white, or clear\nbronze, and shaped with elegance! Faugh!\"\n\n\"Yet I came with half a mind to persuade thee to that very burden!\" he\ncried, with another laugh.\n\n\"Thanks for thy pains,\" I said, blowing blue rings into the air.\n\n\"I have ridden to-day from Jamestown,\" he went on. \"I was the only\nman, i' faith, that cared to leave its gates; and I met the world--the\nbachelor world--flocking to them. Not a mile of the way but I\nencountered Tom, Dick, and Harry, dressed in their Sunday bravery and\nmaking full tilt for the city. And the boats upon the river! I have seen\nthe Thames less crowded.\"\n\n\"There was more passing than usual,\" I said; \"but I was busy in the\nfields, and did not attend. What's the lodestar?\"\n\n\"The star that draws us all,--some to ruin, some to bliss ineffable,\nwoman.\"\n\n\"Humph! The maids have come, then?\"\n\nHe nodded. \"There's a goodly ship down there, with a goodly lading.\"\n\n\"Videlicet, some fourscore waiting damsels and milkmaids, warranted\nhonest by my Lord Warwick,\" I muttered.\n\n\"This business hath been of Edwyn Sandys' management, as you very well\nknow,\" he rejoined, with some heat. \"His word is good: therefore I hold\nthem chaste. That they are fair I can testify, having seen them leave\nthe ship.\"\n\n\"Fair and chaste,\" I said, \"but meanly born.\"\n\n\"I grant you that,\" he answered. \"But after all, what of it? Beggars\nmust not be choosers. The land is new and must be peopled, nor will\nthose who come after us look too curiously into the lineage of those\nto whom a nation owes its birth. What we in these plantations need is\na loosening of the bonds which tie us to home, to England, and a\ntightening of those which bind us to this land in which we have cast our\nlot. We put our hand to the plough, but we turn our heads and look\nto our Egypt and its fleshpots. 'T is children and wife--be that wife\nprincess or peasant--that make home of a desert, that bind a man with\nchains of gold to the country where they abide. Wherefore, when at\nmidday I met good Master Wickham rowing down from Henricus to Jamestown,\nto offer his aid to Master Bucke in his press of business to-morrow, I\ngave the good man Godspeed, and thought his a fruitful errand and one\npleasing to the Lord.\"\n\n\"Amen,\" I yawned. \"I love the land, and call it home. My withers are\nunwrung.\"\n\nHe rose to his feet, and began to pace the greensward before the door.\nMy eyes followed his trim figure, richly though sombrely clad, then fell\nwith a sudden dissatisfaction upon my own stained and frayed apparel.\n\n\"Ralph,\" he said presently, coming to a stand before me, \"have you ever\nan hundred and twenty pounds of tobacco in hand? If not, I\"--\n\n\"I have the weed,\" I replied. \"What then?\"\n\n\"Then at dawn drop down with the tide to the city, and secure for\nthyself one of these same errant damsels.\"\n\nI stared at him, and then broke into laughter, in which, after a space\nand unwillingly, he himself joined. When at length I wiped the water\nfrom my eyes it was quite dark, the whippoorwills had begun to call, and\nRolfe must needs hasten on. I went with him down to the gate.\n\n\"Take my advice,--it is that of your friend,\" he said, as he swung\nhimself into the saddle. He gathered up the reins and struck spurs into\nhis horse, then turned to call back to me: \"Sleep upon my words, Ralph,\nand the next time I come I look to see a farthingale behind thee!\"\n\n\"Thou art as like to see one upon me,\" I answered.\n\nNevertheless, when he had gone, and I climbed the bank and reentered the\nhouse, it was with a strange pang at the cheerlessness of my hearth,\nand an angry and unreasoning impatience at the lack of welcoming face or\nvoice. In God's name, who was there to welcome me? None but my hounds,\nand the flying squirrel I had caught and tamed. Groping my way to the\ncorner, I took from my store two torches, lit them, and stuck them into\nthe holes pierced in the mantel shelf; then stood beneath the clear\nflame, and looked with a sudden sick distaste upon the disorder which\nthe light betrayed. The fire was dead, and ashes and embers were\nscattered upon the hearth; fragments of my last meal littered the table,\nand upon the unwashed floor lay the bones I had thrown my dogs. Dirt\nand confusion reigned; only upon my armor, my sword and gun, my hunting\nknife and dagger, there was no spot or stain. I turned to gaze upon\nthem where they hung against the wall, and in my soul I hated the piping\ntimes of peace, and longed for the camp fire and the call to arms.\n\nWith an impatient sigh, I swept the litter from the table, and,\ntaking from the shelf that held my meagre library a bundle of Master\nShakespeare's plays (gathered for me by Rolfe when he was last in\nLondon), I began to read; but my thoughts wandered, and the tale seemed\ndull and oft told. I tossed it aside, and, taking dice from my pocket,\nbegan to throw. As I cast the bits of bone, idly, and scarce caring to\nobserve what numbers came uppermost, I had a vision of the forester's\nhut at home, where, when I was a boy, in the days before I ran away to\nthe wars in the Low Countries, I had spent many a happy hour. Again I\nsaw the bright light of the fire reflected in each well-scrubbed crock\nand pannikin; again I heard the cheerful hum of the wheel; again the\nface of the forester's daughter smiled upon me. The old gray manor\nhouse, where my mother, a stately dame, sat ever at her tapestry, and an\nimperious elder brother strode to and fro among his hounds, seemed less\nof home to me than did that tiny, friendly hut. To-morrow would be my\nthirty-sixth birthday. All the numbers that I cast were high. \"If I\nthrow ambs-ace,\" I said, with a smile for my own caprice, \"curse me if I\ndo not take Rolfe's advice!\"\n\nI shook the box and clapped it down upon the table, then lifted it,\nand stared with a lengthening face at what it had hidden; which done, I\ndiced no more, but put out my lights and went soberly to bed.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II IN WHICH I MEET MASTER JEREMY SPARROW\n\n\nMINE are not dicers' oaths. The stars were yet shining when I left the\nhouse, and, after a word with my man Diccon, at the servants' huts,\nstrode down the bank and through the gate of the palisade to the wharf,\nwhere I loosed my boat, put up her sail, and turned her head down the\nbroad stream. The wind was fresh and favorable, and we went swiftly down\nthe river through the silver mist toward the sunrise. The sky grew pale\npink to the zenith; then the sun rose and drank up the mist. The river\nsparkled and shone; from the fresh green banks came the smell of the\nwoods and the song of birds; above rose the sky, bright blue, with a few\nfleecy clouds drifting across it. I thought of the day, thirteen years\nbefore, when for the first time white men sailed up this same river,\nand of how noble its width, how enchanting its shores, how gay and sweet\ntheir blooms and odors, how vast their trees, how strange the painted\nsavages, had seemed to us, storm-tossed adventurers, who thought we had\nfound a very paradise, the Fortunate Isles at least. How quickly were\nwe undeceived! As I lay back in the stern with half-shut eyes and tiller\nidle in my hand, our many tribulations and our few joys passed in review\nbefore me. Indian attacks; dissension and strife amongst our rulers;\ntrue men persecuted, false knaves elevated; the weary search for gold\nand the South Sea; the horror of the pestilence and the blacker horror\nof the Starving Time; the arrival of the Patience and Deliverance,\nwhereat we wept like children; that most joyful Sunday morning when we\nfollowed my Lord de la Warre to church; the coming of Dale with that\nstern but wholesome martial code which was no stranger to me who had\nfought under Maurice of Nassau; the good times that followed, when\nbowl-playing gallants were put down, cities founded, forts built, and\nthe gospel preached; the marriage of Rolfe and his dusky princess;\nArgall's expedition, in which I played a part, and Argall's iniquitous\nrule; the return of Yeardley as Sir George, and the priceless gift he\nbrought us,--all this and much else, old friends, old enemies, old toils\nand strifes and pleasures, ran, bitter-sweet, through my memory, as the\nwind and flood bore me on. Of what was before me I did not choose to\nthink, sufficient unto the hour being the evil thereof.\n\nThe river seemed deserted: no horsemen spurred Along the bridle path on\nthe shore; the boats were few and far between, and held only servants\nor Indians or very old men. It was as Rolfe had said, and the free and\nable-bodied of the plantations had put out, posthaste, for matrimony.\nChaplain's Choice appeared unpeopled; Piersey's Hundred slept in the\nsunshine, its wharf deserted, and but few, slow-moving figures in the\ntobacco fields; even the Indian villages looked scant of all but squaws\nand children, for the braves were gone to see the palefaces buy their\nwives. Below Paspahegh a cockleshell of a boat carrying a great white\nsail overtook me, and I was hailed by young Hamor.\n\n\"The maids are come!\" he cried. \"Hurrah!\" and stood up to wave his hat.\n\n\"Humph!\" I said. \"I guess thy destination by thy hose. Are they not\n'those that were thy peach-colored ones'?\"\n\n\"Oons! yes!\" he answered, looking down with complacency upon his\ntarnished finery. \"Wedding garments, Captain Percy, wedding garments!\"\n\nI laughed. \"Thou art a tardy bridegroom. I thought that the bachelors of\nthis quarter of the globe slept last night in Jamestown.\"\n\nHis face fell. \"I know it,\" he said ruefully; \"but my doublet had more\nrents than slashes in it, and Martin Tailor kept it until cockcrow.\nThat fellow rolls in tobacco; he hath grown rich off our impoverished\nwardrobes since the ship down yonder passed the capes. After all,\" he\nbrightened, \"the bargaining takes not place until toward midday, after\nsolemn service and thanksgiving. There's time enough!\" He waved me a\nfarewell, as his great sail and narrow craft carried him past me.\n\nI looked at the sun, which truly was not very high, with a secret\ndisquietude; for I had had a scurvy hope that after all I should be\ntoo late, and so the noose which I felt tightening about my neck might\nunknot itself. Wind and tide were against me, and an hour later saw me\nnearing the peninsula and marveling at the shipping which crowded its\nwaters. It was as if every sloop, barge, canoe, and dugout between Point\nComfort and Henricus were anchored off its shores, while above them\ntowered the masts of the Marmaduke and Furtherance, then in port, and of\nthe tall ship which had brought in those doves for sale. The river with\nits dancing freight, the blue heavens and bright sunshine, the green\ntrees waving in the wind, the stir and bustle in the street and market\nplace thronged with gayly dressed gallants, made a fair and pleasant\nscene. As I drove my boat in between the sloop of the commander of\nShirley Hundred and the canoe of the Nansemond werowance, the two\nbells then newly hung in the church began to peal and the drum to beat.\nStepping ashore, I had a rear view only of the folk who had clustered\nalong the banks and in the street, their faces and footsteps being with\none accord directed toward the market place. I went with the throng,\njostled alike by velvet and dowlas, by youths with their estates upon\ntheir backs and naked fantastically painted savages, and trampling the\ntobacco with which the greedy citizens had planted the very street. In\nthe square I brought up before the Governor's house, and found myself\ncheek by jowl with Master Pory, our Secretary, and Speaker of the\nAssembly.\n\n\"Ha, Ralph Percy!\" he cried, wagging his gray head, \"we two be the only\nsane younkers in the plantations! All the others are horn-mad!\"\n\n\"I have caught the infection,\" I said, \"and am one of the bedlamites.\"\n\nHe stared, then broke into a roar of laughter. \"Art in earnest?\" he\nasked, holding his fat sides. \"Is Saul among the prophets?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I answered. \"I diced last night,--yea or no; and the\n'yea'--plague on 't--had it.\"\n\nHe broke into another roar. \"And thou callest that bridal attire, man!\nWhy, our cow-keeper goes in flaming silk to-day!\"\n\nI looked down upon my suit of buff, which had in truth seen some\nservice, and at my great boots, which I had not thought to clean since I\nmired in a swamp, coming from Henricus the week before; then shrugged my\nshoulders.\n\n\"You will go begging,\" he continued, wiping his eyes. \"Not a one of them\nwill so much as look at you.\"\n\n\"Then will they miss seeing a man, and not a popinjay,\" I retorted. \"I\nshall not break my heart.\"\n\nA cheer arose from the crowd, followed by a crashing peal of the bells\nand a louder roll of the drum. The doors of the houses around and to\nright and left of the square swung open, and the company which had\nbeen quartered overnight upon the citizens began to emerge. By twos and\nthrees, some with hurried steps and downcast eyes, others more slowly\nand with free glances at the staring men, they gathered to the centre of\nthe square, where, in surplice and band, there awaited them godly Master\nBucke and Master Wickham of Henricus. I stared with the rest, though I\ndid not add my voice to theirs.\n\nBefore the arrival of yesterday's ship there had been in this natural\nEden (leaving the savages out of the reckoning) several thousand Adams,\nand but some threescore Eves. And for the most part, the Eves were\neither portly and bustling or withered and shrewish housewives, of age\nand experience to defy the serpent. These were different. Ninety slender\nfigures decked in all the bravery they could assume; ninety comely\nfaces, pink and white, or clear brown with the rich blood showing\nthrough; ninety pair of eyes, laughing and alluring, or downcast with\nlong fringes sweeping rounded cheeks; ninety pair of ripe red lips,--the\ncrowd shouted itself hoarse and would not be restrained, brushing aside\nlike straws the staves of the marshal and his men, and surging in upon\nthe line of adventurous damsels. I saw young men, panting, seize hand or\narm and strive to pull toward them some reluctant fair; others snatched\nkisses, or fell on their knees and began speeches out of Euphues; others\ncommenced an inventory of their possessions,--acres, tobacco, servants,\nhousehold plenishing. All was hubbub, protestation, frightened cries,\nand hysterical laughter. The officers ran to and fro, threatening and\ncommanding; Master Pory alternately cried \"Shame!\" and laughed his\nloudest; and I plucked away a jackanapes of sixteen who had his hand\nupon a girl's ruff, and shook him until the breath was well-nigh out of\nhim. The clamor did but increase.\n\n\"Way for the Governor!\" cried the marshal. \"Shame on you, my masters!\nWay for his Honor and the worshipful Council!\"\n\nThe three wooden steps leading down from the door of the Governor's\nhouse suddenly blossomed into crimson and gold, as his Honor with the\nattendant Councilors emerged from the hall and stood staring at the mob\nbelow.\n\nThe Governor's honest moon face was quite pale with passion. \"What a\ndevil is this?\" he cried wrathfully. \"Did you never see a woman before?\nWhere's the marshal? I'll imprison the last one of you for rioters!\"\n\nUpon the platform of the pillory, which stood in the centre of the\nmarket place, suddenly appeared a man of a gigantic frame, with a strong\nface deeply lined and a great shock of grizzled hair,--a strange thing,\nfor he was not old. I knew him to be one Master Jeremy Sparrow, a\nminister brought by the Southampton a month before, and as yet without\na charge, but at that time I had not spoken with him. Without word of\nwarning he thundered into a psalm of thanksgiving, singing it at the\ntop of a powerful and yet sweet and tender voice, and with a fervor and\nexaltation that caught the heart of the riotous crowd. The two ministers\nin the throng beneath took up the strain; Master Pory added a husky\ntenor, eloquent of much sack; presently we were all singing. The\naudacious suitors, charmed into rationality, fell back, and the broken\nline re-formed. The Governor and the Council descended, and with pomp\nand solemnity took their places between the maids and the two ministers\nwho were to head the column. The psalm ended, the drum beat a thundering\nroll, and the procession moved forward in the direction of the church.\n\nMaster Pory having left me, to take his place among his brethren of\nthe Council, and the mob of those who had come to purchase and of the\ncurious idle having streamed away at the heels of the marshal and his\nofficers, I found myself alone in the square, save for the singer, who\nnow descended from the pillory and came up to me.\n\n\"Captain Ralph Percy, if I mistake not?\" he said, in a voice as deep and\nrich as the bass of an organ.\n\n\"The same,\" I answered. \"And you are Master Jeremy Sparrow?\"\n\n\"Yea, a silly preacher,--the poorest, meekest, and lowliest of the\nLord's servitors.\"\n\nHis deep voice, magnificent frame, and bold and free address so gave\nthe lie to the humility of his words that I had much ado to keep from\nlaughing. He saw, and his face, which was of a cast most martial,\nflashed into a smile, like sunshine on a scarred cliff.\n\n\"You laugh in your sleeve,\" he said good-humoredly, \"and yet I am but\nwhat I profess to be. In spirit I am a very Job, though nature hath\nfit to dress me as a Samson. I assure you, I am worse misfitted than is\nMaster Yardstick yonder in those Falstaffian hose. But, good sir, will\nyou not go to church?\"\n\n\"If the church were Paul's, I might,\" I answered. \"As it is, we could\nnot get within fifty feet of the door.\"\n\n\"Of the great door, ay, but the ministers may pass through the side\ndoor. If you please, I will take you in with me. The pretty fools yonder\nmarch slowly; if we turn down this lane, we will outstrip them quite.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" I said, and we turned into a lane thick planted with tobacco,\nmade a detour of the Governor's house, and outflanked the procession,\narriving at the small door before it had entered the churchyard. Here we\nfound the sexton mounting guard.\n\n\"I am Master Sparrow, the minister that came in the Southampton,\" my\nnew acquaintance explained. \"I am to sit in the choir. Let us pass, good\nfellow.\"\n\nThe sexton squared himself before the narrow opening, and swelled with\nimportance.\n\n\"You, reverend sir, I will admit, such being my duty. But this gentleman\nis no preacher; I may not allow him to pass.\"\n\n\"You mistake, friend,\" said my companion gravely. \"This gentleman, my\nworthy colleague, has but just come from the island of St. Brandon,\nwhere he preaches on the witches' Sabbath: hence the disorder of his\napparel. His admittance be on my head: wherefore let us by.\"\n\n\"None to enter at the west door save Councilors, commander, and\nministers. Any attempting to force an entrance to be arrested and laid\nby the heels if they be of the generality, or, if they be of quality,\nto be duly fined and debarred from the purchase of any maid whatsoever,\"\nchanted the sexton.\n\n\"Then, in God's name, let's on!\" I exclaimed \"Here, try this!\" and I\ndrew from my purse, which was something of the leanest, a shilling.\n\n\"Try this,\" quoth Master Jeremy Sparrow, and knocked the sexton down.\n\nWe left the fellow sprawling in the doorway, sputtering threats to the\nair without, but with one covetous hand clutching at the shilling which\nI threw behind me, and entered the church, which we found yet empty,\nthough through the open great door we heard the drum beat loudly and a\ndeepening sound of footsteps.\n\n\"I have choice of position,\" I said. \"Yonder window seems a good\nstation. You remain here in the choir?\"\n\n\"Ay,\" he answered, with a sigh; \"the dignity of my calling must be\nupheld: wherefore I sit in high places, rubbing elbows with gold lace,\nwhen of the very truth the humility of my spirit is such that I would\nfeel more at home in the servants' seats or among the negars that we\nbought last year.\"\n\nHad we not been in church I would have laughed, though indeed I saw that\nhe devoutly believed his own words. He took his seat in the largest\nand finest of the chairs behind the great velvet one reserved for the\nGovernor, while I went and leaned against my window, and we stared at\neach other across the flower-decked building in profound silence, until,\nwith one great final crash, the bells ceased, the drum stopped beating,\nand the procession entered.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III IN WHICH I MARRY IN HASTE\n\n\nTHE long service of praise and thanksgiving was well-nigh over when I\nfirst saw her.\n\nShe sat some ten feet from me, in the corner, and so in the shadow of a\ntall pew. Beyond her was a row of milkmaid beauties, red of cheek, free\nof eye, deep-bosomed, and beribboned like Maypoles. I looked again, and\nsaw--and see--a rose amongst blowzed poppies and peonies, a pearl amidst\nglass beads, a Perdita in a ring of rustics, a nonparella of all grace\nand beauty! As I gazed with all my eyes, I found more than grace and\nbeauty in that wonderful face,--found pride, wit, fire, determination,\nfinally shame and anger. For, feeling my eyes upon her, she looked up\nand met what she must have thought the impudent stare of an appraiser.\nHer face, which had been without color, pale and clear like the sky\nabout the evening star, went crimson in a moment. She bit her lip and\nshot at me one withering glance, then dropped her eyelids and hid the\nlightning. When I looked at her again, covertly, and from under my hand\nraised as though to push back my hair, she was pale once more, and her\ndark eyes were fixed upon the water and the green trees without the\nwindow.\n\nThe congregation rose, and she stood up with the other maids. Her dress\nof dark woolen, severe and unadorned, her close ruff and prim white\ncoif, would have cried \"Puritan,\" had ever Puritan looked like this\nwoman, upon whom the poor apparel had the seeming of purple and ermine.\n\nAnon came the benediction. Governor, Councilors, commanders, and\nministers left the choir and paced solemnly down the aisle; the maids\nclosed in behind; and we who had lined the walls, shifting from one heel\nto the other for a long two hours, brought up the rear, and so passed\nfrom the church to a fair green meadow adjacent thereto. Here the\ncompany disbanded; the wearers of gold lace betaking themselves to seats\nerected in the shadow of a mighty oak, and the ministers, of whom there\nwere four, bestowing themselves within pulpits of turf. For one altar\nand one clergyman could not hope to dispatch that day's business.\n\nAs for the maids, for a minute or more they made one cluster; then,\nshyly or with laughter, they drifted apart like the petals of a\nwind-blown rose, and silk doublet and hose gave chase. Five minutes saw\nthe goodly company of damsels errant and would-be bridegrooms scattered\nfar and near over the smiling meadow. For the most part they went man\nand maid, but the fairer of the feminine cohort had rings of clamorous\nsuitors from whom to choose. As for me, I walked alone; for if by chance\nI neared a maid, she looked (womanlike) at my apparel first, and never\nreached my face, but squarely turned her back. So disengaged, I felt\nlike a guest at a mask, and in some measure enjoyed the show, though\nwith an uneasy consciousness that I was pledged to become, sooner or\nlater, a part of the spectacle. I saw a shepherdess fresh from Arcadia\nwave back a dozen importunate gallants, then throw a knot of blue ribbon\ninto their midst, laugh with glee at the scramble that ensued, and\nfinally march off with the wearer of the favor. I saw a neighbor of\nmine, tall Jack Pride, who lived twelve miles above me, blush and\nstammer, and bow again and again to a milliner's apprentice of a girl,\nnot five feet high and all eyes, who dropped a curtsy at each bow. When\nI had passed them fifty yards or more, and looked back, they were still\nbobbing and bowing. And I heard a dialogue between Phyllis and Corydon.\nSays Phyllis, \"Any poultry?\"\n\nCorydon. \"A matter of twalve hens and twa cocks.\"\n\nPhyllis. \"A cow?\"\n\nCorydon. \"Twa.\"\n\nPhyllis. \"How much tobacco?\"\n\nCorydon. \"Three acres, hinny, though I dinna drink the weed mysel'. I'm\na Stewart, woman, an' the King's puir cousin.\"\n\nPhyllis. \"What household plenishing?\"\n\nCorydon. \"Ane large bed, ane flock bed, ane trundle bed, ane chest, ane\ntrunk, ane leather cairpet, sax cawfskin chairs an' twa-three rush, five\npair o' sheets an' auchteen dowlas napkins, sax alchemy spunes\"--\n\nPhyllis. \"I'll take you.\"\n\nAt the far end of the meadow, near to the fort, I met young Hamor,\nalone, flushed, and hurrying back to the more populous part of the\nfield.\n\n\"Not yet mated?\" I asked. \"Where are the maids' eyes?\"\n\n\"By--!\" he answered, with an angry laugh. \"If they're all like the\nsample I've just left, I'll buy me a squaw from the Paspaheghs!\"\n\nI smiled. \"So your wooing has not prospered?\"\n\nHis vanity took fire. \"I have not wooed in earnest,\" he said carelessly,\nand hitched forward his cloak of sky-blue tuftaffeta with an air. \"I\nsheered off quickly enough, I warrant you, when I found the nature of\nthe commodity I had to deal with.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" I said. \"When I left the crowd they were going very fast. You had\nbest hurry, if you wish to secure a bargain.\"\n\n\"I'm off,\" he answered; then, jerking his thumb over his shoulder,\n\"If you keep on to the river and that clump of cedars, you will find\nTermagaunt in ruff and farthingale.\"\n\nWhen he was gone, I stood still for a while and watched the slow sweep\nof a buzzard high in the blue, after which I unsheathed my dagger, and\nwith it tried to scrape the dried mud from my boots. Succeeding but\nindifferently, I put the blade up, stared again at the sky, drew a long\nbreath, and marched upon the covert of cedars indicated by Hamor.\n\nAs I neared it, I heard at first only the wash of the river; but\npresently there came to my ears the sound of a man's voice, and then a\nwoman's angry \"Begone, sir!\"\n\n\"Kiss and be friends,\" said the man.\n\nThe sound that followed being something of the loudest for even the most\nhearty salutation, I was not surprised, on parting the bushes, to find\nthe man nursing his cheek, and the maid her hand.\n\n\"You shall pay well for that, you sweet vixen!\" he cried, and caught her\nby both wrists.\n\nShe struggled fiercely, bending her head this way and that, but his hot\nlips had touched her face before I could come between.\n\nWhen I had knocked him down he lay where he fell, dazed by the blow,\nand blinking up at me with his small ferret eyes. I knew him to be one\nEdward Sharpless, and I knew no good of him. He had been a lawyer in\nEngland. He lay on the very brink of the stream, with one arm touching\nthe water. Flesh and blood could not resist it, so, assisted by the toe\nof my boot, he took a cold bath to cool his hot blood.\n\nWhen he had clambered out and had gone away, cursing, I turned to face\nher. She stood against the trunk of a great cedar, her head thrown back,\na spot of angry crimson in each cheek, one small hand clenched at her\nthroat. I had heard her laugh as Sharpless touched the water, but now\nthere was only defiance in her face. As we gazed at each other, a\nburst of laughter came to us from the meadow behind. I looked over my\nshoulder, and beheld young Hamor, probably disappointed of a wife,--with\nGiles Allen and Wynne, returning to his abandoned quarry. She saw, too,\nfor the crimson spread and deepened and her bosom heaved. Her dark eyes,\nglancing here and there like those of a hunted creature, met my own.\n\n\"Madam,\" I said, \"will you marry me?\"\n\nShe looked at me strangely. \"Do you live here?\" she asked at last, with\na disdainful wave of her hand toward the town.\n\n\"No, madam,\" I answered. \"I live up river, in Weyanoke Hundred, some\nmiles from here.\"\n\n\"Then, in God's name, let us be gone!\" she cried, with sudden passion.\n\nI bowed low, and advanced to kiss her hand.\n\nThe finger tips which she slowly and reluctantly resigned to me were\nicy, and the look with which she favored me was not such an one as poets\nfeign for like occasions. I shrugged the shoulders of my spirit, but\nsaid nothing. So, hand in hand, though at arms' length, we passed from\nthe shade of the cedars into the open meadow, where we presently met\nHamor and his party. They would have barred the way, laughing and making\nunsavory jests, but I drew her closer to me and laid my hand upon my\nsword. They stood aside, for I was the best swordsman in Virginia.\n\nThe meadow was now less thronged. The river, up and down, was white with\nsailboats, and across the neck of the peninsula went a line of horsemen,\neach with his purchase upon a pillion behind him. The Governor, the\nCouncilors, and the commanders had betaken themselves to the Governor's\nhouse, where a great dinner was to be given. But Master Piersey, the\nCape Merchant, remained to see the Company reimbursed to the last leaf,\nand the four ministers still found occupation, though one couple trod\nnot upon the heels of another, as they had done an hour agone.\n\n\"I must first satisfy the treasurer,\" I said, coming to a halt within\nfifty feet of the now deserted high places.\n\nShe drew her hand from mine, and looked me up and down.\n\n\"How much is it?\" she asked at last. \"I will pay it.\"\n\nI stared at her.\n\n\"Can't you speak?\" she cried, with a stamp of her foot. \"At what am I\nvalued? Ten pounds--fifty pounds\"--\n\n\"At one hundred and twenty pounds of tobacco, madam,\" I said dryly. \"I\nwill pay it myself. To what name upon the ship's list do you answer?\"\n\n\"Patience Worth,\" she replied.\n\nI left her standing there, and went upon my errand with a whirling\nbrain. Her enrollment in that company proclaimed her meanly born, and\nshe bore herself as of blood royal; of her own free will she had crossed\nan ocean to meet this day, and she held in passionate hatred this\nday and all that it contained; she was come to Virginia to better her\ncondition, and the purse which she had drawn from her bosom was filled\nwith gold pieces. To another I would have advised caution, delay,\napplication to the Governor, inquiry; for myself I cared not to make\ninquiries.\n\nThe treasurer gave me my receipt, and I procured, from the crowd around\nhim, Humfrey Kent, a good man and true, and old Belfield, the perfumer,\nfor witnesses. With them at my heels I went back to her, and, giving her\nmy hand, was making for the nearest minister, when a voice at a little\ndistance hailed me, crying out, \"This way, Captain Percy!\"\n\nI turned toward the voice, and beheld the great figure of Master\nJeremy Sparrow sitting, cross-legged like the Grand Turk, upon a grassy\nhillock, and beckoning to me from that elevation.\n\n\"Our acquaintance hath been of the shortest,\" he said genially, when the\nmaid, the witnesses, and I had reached the foot of the hillock, \"but I\nhave taken a liking to you and would fain do you a service. Moreover, I\nlack employment. The maids take me for a hedge parson, and sheer off\nto my brethren, who truly are of a more clerical appearance. Whereas if\nthey could only look upon the inner man! You have been long in choosing,\nbut have doubtless chosen\"--He glanced from me to the woman beside me,\nand broke off with open mouth and staring eyes. There was excuse, for\nher beauty was amazing. \"A paragon,\" he ended, recovering himself.\n\n\"Marry us quickly, friend,\" I said. \"Clouds are gathering, and we have\nfar to go.\"\n\nHe came down from his mound, and we went and stood before him. I had\naround my neck the gold chain given me upon a certain occasion by Prince\nMaurice, and in lieu of other ring I now twisted off the smallest link\nand gave it to her.\n\n\"Your name?\" asked Master Sparrow, opening his book.\n\n\"Ralph Percy, Gentleman.\"\n\n\"And yours?\" he demanded, staring at her with a somewhat too apparent\ndelight in her beauty.\n\nShe flushed richly and bit her lip.\n\nHe repeated the question.\n\nShe stood a minute in silence, her eyes upon the darkening sky. Then she\nsaid in a low voice, \"Jocelyn Leigh.\"\n\nIt was not the name I had watched the Cape Merchant strike off his list.\nI turned upon her and made her meet my eyes. \"What is your name?\" I\ndemanded. \"Tell me the truth!\"\n\n\"I have told it,\" she answered proudly. \"It is Jocelyn Leigh.\"\n\nI faced the minister again. \"Go on,\" I said briefly.\n\n\"The Company commands that no constraint be put upon its poor maids.\nWherefore, do you marry this man of your own free will and choice?\"\n\n\"Ay,\" she said, \"of my own free will.\"\n\nWell, we were married, and Master Jeremy Sparrow wished us joy, and Kent\nwould have kissed the bride had I not frowned him off. He and Belfield\nstrode away, and I left her there, and went to get her bundle from the\nhouse that had sheltered her overnight. Returning, I found her seated\non the turf, her chin in her hand and her dark eyes watching the distant\nplay of lightning. Master Sparrow had left his post, and was nowhere to\nbe seen.\n\nI gave her my hand and led her to the shore; then loosed my boat and\nhelped her aboard. I was pushing off when a voice hailed us from the\nbank, and the next instant a great bunch of red roses whirled past me\nand fell into her lap. \"Sweets to the sweet, you know,\" said Master\nJeremy Sparrow genially. \"Goodwife Allen will never miss them.\"\n\nI was in two minds whether to laugh or to swear,--for I had never\ngiven her flowers,--when she settled the question for me by raising the\ncrimson mass and bestowing it upon the flood.\n\nA sudden puff of wind brought the sail around, hiding his fallen\ncountenance. The wind freshened, coming from the bay, and the boat\nwas off like a startled deer. When I next saw him he had recovered his\nequanimity, and, with a smile upon his rugged features, was waving us\na farewell. I looked at the beauty opposite me, and, with a sudden\nmovement of pity for him, mateless, stood up and waved to him vigorously\nin turn.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV IN WHICH I AM LIKE TO REPENT AT LEISURE\n\n\nWHEN we had passed the mouth of the Chickahominy, I broke the silence,\nnow prolonged beyond reason, by pointing to the village upon its bank,\nand telling her something of Smith's expedition up that river, ending by\nasking her if she feared the savages.\n\nWhen at length she succeeded in abstracting her attention from the\nclouds, it was to answer in the negative, in a tone of the supremest\nindifference, after which she relapsed into her contemplation of the\nweather.\n\nFurther on I tried again. \"That is Kent's, yonder. He brought his wife\nfrom home last year. What a hedge of sunflowers she has planted! If you\nlove flowers, you will find those of paradise in these woods.\"\n\nNo answer.\n\nBelow Martin-Brandon we met a canoe full of Paspaheghs, bound upon a\nfriendly visit to some one of the down-river tribes; for in the bottom\nof the boat reposed a fat buck, and at the feet of the young men lay\ntrenchers of maize cakes and of late mulberries. I hailed them, and when\nwe were alongside held up the brooch from my hat, then pointed to the\npurple fruit. The exchange was soon made; they sped away, and I placed\nthe mulberries upon the thwart beside her.\n\n\"I am not hungry,\" she said coldly. \"Take them away.\"\n\nI bit my lip, and returned to my place at the tiller. This rose was set\nwith thorns, and already I felt their sting. Presently she leaned back\nin the nest I had made for her. \"I wish to sleep,\" she said haughtily,\nand, turning her face from me, pillowed her head upon her arms.\n\nI sat, bent forward, the tiller in my hand, and stared at my wife in\nsome consternation. This was not the tame pigeon, the rosy, humble,\ndomestic creature who was to make me a home and rear me children. A sea\nbird with broad white wings swooped down upon the water, now dark and\nridged, rested there a moment, then swept away into the heart of the\ngathering storm. She was liker such an one. Such birds were caught at\ntimes, but never tamed and never kept.\n\nThe lightning, which had played incessantly in pale flashes across the\nlow clouds in the south, now leaped to higher peaks and became more\nvivid, and the muttering of the thunder changed to long, booming peals.\nThirteen years before, the Virginia storms had struck us with terror.\nCompared with those of the Old World we had left, they were as cannon to\nthe whistling of arrows, as breakers on an iron coast to the dull wash\nof level seas. Now they were nothing to me, but as the peals changed to\ngreat crashes as of falling cities, I marveled to see my wife sleeping\nso quietly. The rain began to fall, slowly, in large sullen drops, and I\nrose to cover her with my cloak. Then I saw that the sleep was feigned,\nfor she was gazing at the storm with wide eyes, though with no fear in\ntheir dark depths. When I moved they closed, and when I reached her the\nlashes still swept her cheeks, and she breathed evenly through parted\nlips. But, against her will, she shrank from my touch as I put the cloak\nabout her; and when I had returned to my seat, I bent to one side and\nsaw, as I had expected to see, that her eyes were wide open again. If\nshe had been one whit less beautiful, I would have wished her back at\nJamestown, back on the Atlantic, back at whatever outlandish place,\nwhere manners were unknown, that had owned her and cast her out. Pride\nand temper! I set my lips, and vowed that she should find her match.\n\nThe storm did not last. Ere we had reached Piersey's the rain had ceased\nand the clouds were breaking; above Chaplain's Choice hung a great\nrainbow; we passed Tants Weyanoke in the glory of the sunset, all\nshattered gold and crimson. Not a word had been spoken. I sat in a humor\ngrim enough, and she lay there before me, wide awake, staring at the\nshifting banks and running water, and thinking that I thought she slept.\n\nAt last my own wharf rose before me through the gathering dusk, and\nbeyond it shone out a light; for I had told Diccon to set my house in\norder, and to provide fire and torches, that my wife might see I wished\nto do her honor. I looked at that wife, and of a sudden the anger in my\nheart melted away. It was a wilderness vast and dreadful to which she\nhad come. The mighty stream, the towering forests, the black skies and\ndeafening thunder, the wild cries of bird and beast the savages, uncouth\nand terrible,--for a moment I saw my world as the woman at my feet must\nsee it, strange, wild, and menacing, an evil land, the other side of the\nmoon. A thing that I had forgotten came to my mind: how that, after our\nlanding at Jamestown, years before, a boy whom we had with us did each\nnight fill with cries and lamentations the hut where he lay with my\ncousin Percy, Gosnold, and myself, nor would cease though we tried both\ncrying shame and a rope's end. It was not for homesickness, for he\nhad no mother or kin or home; and at length Master Hunt brought him to\nconfess that it was but pure panic terror of the land itself,--not of\nthe Indians or of our hardships, both of which he faced bravely enough,\nbut of the strange trees and the high and long roofs of vine, of\nthe black sliding earth and the white mist, of the fireflies and the\nwhippoorwills,--a sick fear of primeval Nature and her tragic mask.\n\nThis was a woman, young, alone, and friendless, unless I, who had sworn\nto cherish and protect her, should prove myself her friend. Wherefore,\nwhen, a few minutes later, I bent over her, it was with all gentleness\nthat I touched and spoke to her.\n\n\"Our journey is over,\" I said. \"This is home, my dear.\"\n\nShe let me help her to her feet, and up the wet and slippery steps to\nthe level of the wharf. It was now quite dark, there being no moon, and\nthin clouds obscuring the stars. The touch of her hand, which I perforce\nheld since I must guide her over the long, narrow, and unrailed trestle,\nchilled me, and her breathing was hurried, but she moved by my side\nthrough the gross darkness unfalteringly enough. Arrived at the gate of\nthe palisade, I beat upon it with the hilt of my sword, and shouted to\nmy men to open to us. A moment, and a dozen torches came flaring down\nthe bank. Diccon shot back the bolts, and we entered. The men drew\nup and saluted; for I held my manor a camp, my servants soldiers, and\nmyself their captain.\n\nI have seen worse favored companies, but doubtless the woman beside\nme had not. Perhaps, too, the red light of the torches, now flaring\nbrightly, now sunk before the wind, gave their countenances a more\nvillainous cast than usual. They were not all bad. Diccon had the\nvirtue of fidelity, if none other; there were a brace of Puritans, and\na handful of honest fools, who, if they drilled badly, yet abhorred\nmutiny. But the half dozen I had taken off Argall's hands; the Dutchmen\nwho might have been own brothers to those two Judases, Adam and Francis;\nthe thief and the highwayman I had bought from the precious crew sent\nus by the King the year before; the negro and the Indians--small wonder\nthat she shrank and cowered. It was but for a moment. I was yet seeking\nfor words sufficiently reassuring when she was herself again. She\ndid not deign to notice the men's awkward salute, and when Diccon, a\nhandsome rogue enough, advancing to light us up the bank, brushed by her\nsomething too closely, she drew away her skirts as though he had been a\nlazar. At my own door I turned and spoke to the men, who had followed us\nup the ascent.\n\n\"This lady,\" I said, taking her hand as she stood beside me, \"is my true\nand lawful wife, your mistress, to be honored and obeyed as such. Who\nfails in reverence to her I hold as mutinous to myself, and will deal\nwith him accordingly. She gives you to-morrow for holiday, with double\nrations, and to each a measure of rum. Now thank her properly.\"\n\nThey cheered lustily, of course, and Diccon, stepping forward, gave us\nthanks in the name of them all, and wished us joy. After which, with\nanother cheer, they backed from out our presence, then turned and made\nfor their quarters, while I led my wife within the house and closed the\ndoor.\n\nDiccon was an ingenious scoundrel. I had told him to banish the dogs, to\nhave the house cleaned and lit, and supper upon the table; but I had\nnot ordered the floor to be strewn with rushes, the walls draped with\nflowering vines, a great jar filled with sunflowers, and an illumination\nof a dozen torches. Nevertheless, it looked well, and I highly approved\nthe capon and maize cakes, the venison pasty and ale, with which the\ntable was set. Through the open doors of the two other rooms were to be\nseen more rushes, more flowers, and more lights.\n\nTo the larger of these rooms I now led the way, deposited her bundle\nupon the settle, and saw that Diccon had provided fair water for her\nface and hands; which done, I told her that supper waited upon her\nconvenience, and went back to the great room.\n\nShe was long in coming, so long that I grew impatient and went to call\nher. The door was ajar, and so I saw her, kneeling in the middle of the\nfloor, her head thrown back, her hands raised and clasped, on her face\nterror and anguish of spirit written so large that I started to see it.\nI stared in amazement, and, had I followed my first impulse, would\nhave gone to her, as I would have gone to any other creature in so dire\ndistress. On second thoughts, I went noiselessly back to my station in\nthe great room. She had not seen me, I was sure. Nor had I long to wait.\nPresently she appeared, and I could have doubted the testimony of my\neyes, so changed were the agonized face and figure of a few moments\nbefore. Beautiful and disdainful, she moved to the table, and took\nthe great chair drawn before it with the air of an empress mounting a\nthrone. I contented myself with the stool.\n\nShe ate nothing, and scarcely touched the canary I poured for her.\nI pressed upon her wine and viands,--in vain; I strove to make\nconversation,--equally in vain. Finally, tired of \"yes\" and \"no\" uttered\nas though she were reluctantly casting pearls before swine, I desisted,\nand applied myself to my supper in a silence as sullen as her own. At\nlast we rose from table, and I went to look to the fastenings of door\nand windows, and returning found her standing in the centre of the room,\nher head up and her hands clenched at her sides. I saw that we were to\nhave it out then and there, and I was glad of it.\n\n\"You have something to say,\" I said. \"I am quite at your command,\" and I\nwent and leaned against the chimneypiece.\n\nThe low fire upon the hearth burnt lower still before she broke the\nsilence. When she did speak it was slowly, and with a voice which was\nevidently controlled only by a strong effort of a strong will. She\nsaid:--\n\n\"When--yesterday, to-day, ten thousand years ago you went from this\nhorrible forest down to that wretched village yonder, to those huts that\nmake your London, you went to buy you a wife?\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" I answered. \"I went with that intention.\"\n\n\"You had made your calculation? In your mind you had pitched upon\nsuch and such an article, with such and such qualities, as desirable?\nDoubtless you meant to get your money's worth?\"\n\n\"Doubtless,\" I said dryly.\n\n\"Will you tell me what you were inclined to consider its equivalent?\"\n\nI stared at her, much inclined to laugh. The interview promised to be\ninteresting.\n\n\"I went to Jamestown to get me a wife,\" I said at length, \"because I had\npledged my word that I would do so. I was not over-anxious. I did not\nrun all the way. But, as you say, I intended to do the best I could for\nmyself; one hundred and twenty pounds of tobacco being a considerable\nsum, and not to be lightly thrown away. I went to look for a mistress\nfor my house, a companion for my idle hours, a rosy, humble, docile\nlass, with no aspirations beyond cleanliness and good temper, who was to\norder my household and make me a home. I was to be her head and her law,\nbut also her sword and shield. That is what I went to look for.\"\n\n\"And you found--me!\" she said, and broke into strange laughter.\n\nI bowed.\n\n\"In God's name, why did you not go further?\"\n\nI suppose she saw in my face why I went no further, for into her own the\ncolor came flaming.\n\n\"I am not what I seem!\" she cried out. \"I was not in that company of\nchoice!\"\n\nI bowed again. \"You have no need to tell me that, madam,\" I said. \"I\nhave eyes. I desire to know why you were there at all, and why you\nmarried me.\"\n\nShe turned from me, until I could see nothing but the coiled wealth of\nher hair and the bit of white neck between it and the ruff. We stood so\nin silence, she with bent head and fingers clasping and unclasping,\nI leaning against the wall and staring at her, for what seemed a long\ntime. At least I had time to grow impatient, when she faced me again,\nand all my irritation vanished in a gasp of admiration.\n\nOh, she was beautiful, and of a sweetness most alluring and fatal! Had\nMedea worn such a look, sure Jason had quite forgot the fleece, and with\nthose eyes Circe had needed no other charm to make men what she would.\nHer voice, when she spoke, was no longer imperious; it was low pleading\nmusic. And she held out entreating hands.\n\n\"Have pity on me,\" she said. \"Listen kindly, and have pity on me. You\nare a strong man and wear a sword. You can cut your way through trouble\nand peril. I am a woman, weak, friendless, helpless. I was in distress\nand peril, and I had no arm to save, no knight to fight my battle. I do\nnot love deceit. Ah, do not think that I have not hated myself for the\nlie I have been. But these forest creatures that you take,--will they\nnot bite against springe and snare? Are they scrupulous as to how they\nfree themselves? I too was in the toils of the hunter, and I too was not\nscrupulous. There was a thing of which I stood in danger that would\nhave been bitterer to me, a thousand times, than death. I had but\none thought, to escape; how, I did not care,--only to escape. I had a\nwaiting woman named Patience Worth. One night she came to me, weeping.\nShe had wearied of service, and had signed to go to Virginia as one of\nSir Edwyn Sandys' maids, and at the last moment her heart had failed\nher. There had been pressure brought to bear upon me that day,--I had\nbeen angered to the very soul. I sent her away with a heavy bribe, and\nin her dress and under her name I fled from--I went aboard that ship. No\none guessed that I was not the Patience Worth to whose name I answered.\nNo one knows now,--none but you, none but you.\"\n\n\"And why am I so far honored, madam?\" I said bluntly.\n\nShe crimsoned, then went white again. She was trembling now through her\nwhole frame. At last she broke out: \"I am not of that crew that came\nto marry! To me you are the veriest stranger,--you are but the hand at\nwhich I caught to draw myself from a pit that had been digged for me.\nIt was my hope that this hour would never come. When I fled, mad\nfor escape, willing to dare anything but that which I left behind,\nI thought, 'I may die before that ship with its shameless cargo sets\nsail.' When the ship set sail, and we met with stormy weather, and there\nwas much sickness aboard, I thought, 'I may drown or I may die of the\nfever.' When, this afternoon, I lay there in the boat, coming up this\ndreadful river through the glare of the lightning, and you thought I\nslept, I was thinking, 'The bolts may strike me yet, and all will be\nwell.' I prayed for that death, but the storm passed. I am not without\nshame. I know that you must think all ill of me, that you must feel\nyourself gulled and cheated. I am sorry--that is all I can say--I am\nsorry. I am your wife--I was married to you to-day--but I know you not\nand love you not. I ask you to hold me as I hold myself, a guest in your\nhouse, nothing more. I am quite at your mercy. I am entirely friendless,\nentirely alone. I appeal to your generosity, to your honor\"--\n\nBefore I could prevent her she was kneeling to me, and she would not\nrise, though I bade her do so.\n\nI went to the door, unbarred it, and looked out into the night, for\nthe air within the room stifled me. It was not much better outside. The\nclouds had gathered again, and were now hanging thick and low. From the\ndistance came a rumble of thunder, and the whole night was dull,\nheavy, and breathless. Hot anger possessed me: anger against Rolfe\nfor suggesting this thing to me; anger against myself for that unlucky\nthrow; anger, most of all, against the woman who had so cozened me. In\nthe servants' huts, a hundred yards away, lights were still burning,\nagainst rule, for the hour was late. Glad that there was something I\ncould rail out against, I strode down upon the men, and caught them\nassembled in Diccon's cabin, dicing for to-morrow's rum. When I had\nstruck out the light with my rapier, and had rated the rogues to\ntheir several quarters, I went back through the gathering storm to the\nbrightly-lit, flower-decked room, and to Mistress Percy.\n\nShe was still kneeling, her hands at her breast, and her eyes, wide and\ndark, fixed upon the blackness without the open door. I went up to her\nand took her by the hand.\n\n\"I am a gentleman, madam,\" I said. \"You need have no fear of me. I pray\nyou to rise.\"\n\nShe stood up at that, and her breath came hurriedly through her parted\nlips, but she did not speak.\n\n\"It grows late, and you must be weary,\" I continued. \"Your room is\nyonder. I trust that you will sleep well. Good-night.\"\n\nI bowed low, and she curtsied to me. \"Good-night,\" she said.\n\nOn her way to the door, she brushed against the rack wherein hung my\nweapons. Among them was a small dagger. Her quick eye caught its gleam,\nand I saw her press closer to the wall, and with her right hand\nstrive stealthily to detach the blade from its fastening. She did not\nunderstand the trick. Her hand dropped to her side, and she was passing\non, when I crossed the room, loosened the dagger, and offered it to her,\nwith a smile and a bow. She flushed scarlet and bit her lips, but she\ntook it.\n\n\"There are bars to the door within,\" I said. \"Again, good-night.\"\n\n\"Good-night,\" she answered, and, entering the room, she shut the door. A\nmoment more, and I heard the heavy bars drop into place.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V IN WHICH A WOMAN HAS HER WAY\n\n\nTEN days later, Rolfe, going down river in his barge, touched at my\nwharf, and finding me there walked with me toward the house.\n\n\"I have not seen you since you laughed my advice to scorn--and took it,\"\nhe said. \"Where's the farthingale, Benedick the married man?\"\n\n\"In the house.\"\n\n\"Oh, ay!\" he commented. \"It's near to supper time. I trust she's a good\ncook?\"\n\n\"She does not cook,\" I said dryly. \"I have hired old Goody Cotton to do\nthat.\"\n\nHe eyed me closely. \"By all the gods! a new doublet! She is skillful\nwith her needle, then?\"\n\n\"She may be,\" I answered. \"Having never seen her with one, I am no\njudge. The doublet was made by the tailor at Flowerdieu Hundred.\"\n\nBy this we had reached the level sward at the top of the bank. \"Roses!\"\nhe exclaimed,--\"a long row of them new planted! An arbor, too, and\na seat beneath the big walnut! Since when hast thou turned gardner,\nRalph?\"\n\n\"It's Diccon's doing. He is anxious to please his mistress.\"\n\n\"Who neither sews, nor cooks, nor plants! What does she do?\"\n\n\"She pulls the roses,\" I said. \"Come in.\"\n\nWhen we had entered the house he stared about him; then cried out,\n\"Acrasia's bower! Oh, thou sometime Guyon!\" and began to laugh.\n\nIt was late afternoon, and the slant sunshine streaming in at door and\nwindow striped wall and floor with gold. Floor and wall were no longer\nlogs gnarled and stained: upon the one lay a carpet of delicate ferns\nand aromatic leaves, and glossy vines, purple-berried, tapestried\nthe other. Flowers--purple and red and yellow--were everywhere. As we\nentered, a figure started up from the hearth.\n\n\"St. George!\" exclaimed Rolfe. \"You have never married a blackamoor?\"\n\n\"It is the negress, Angela,\" I said. \"I bought her from William Pierce\nthe other day. Mistress Percy wished a waiting damsel.\"\n\nThe creature, one of the five females of her kind then in Virginia,\nlooked at us with large, rolling eyes. She knew a little Spanish, and I\nspoke to her in that tongue, bidding her find her mistress and tell her\nthat company waited. When she was gone I placed a jack of ale upon the\ntable, and Rolfe and I sat down to discuss it. Had I been in a mood\nfor laughter, I could have found reason in his puzzled face. There were\nflowers upon the table, and beside them a litter of small objects, one\nof which he now took up.\n\n\"A white glove,\" he said, \"perfumed and silver-fringed, and of a size to\nfit Titania.\"\n\nI spread its mate out upon my palm. \"A woman's hand. Too white, too\nsoft, and too small.\"\n\nHe touched lightly, one by one, the slender fingers of the glove he\nheld. \"A woman's hand,--strength in weakness, veiled power, the star in\nthe mist, guiding, beckoning, drawing upward!\"\n\nI laughed and threw the glove from me. \"The star, a will-of-the-wisp;\nthe goal, a slough,\" I said.\n\nAs he sat opposite me a change came over his face, a change so great\nthat I knew before I turned that she was in the room.\n\nThe bundle which I had carried for her from Jamestown was neither small\nnor light. Why, when she fled, she chose to burden herself with such\ntoys, or whether she gave a thought to the suspicions that might be\nraised in Virginia if one of Sir Edwyn's maids bedecked herself in silk\nand lace and jewels, I do not know, but she had brought to the forest\nand the tobacco fields the gauds of a maid of honor. The Puritan dress\nin which I first saw her was a thing of the past; she clothed herself\nnow like the parrakeets in the forest,--or liker the lilies of the\nfield, for verily she toiled not, neither did she spin.\n\nRolfe and I rose from our seats. \"Mistress Percy,\" I said, \"let me\npresent to you a right worthy gentleman and my very good friend, Master\nJohn Rolfe.\"\n\nShe curtsied, and he bowed low. He was a man of quick wit and had been\nat court, but for a time he could find no words. Then: \"Mistress Percy's\nface is not one to be forgotten. I have surely seen it before, though\nwhere\"--\n\nHer color mounted, but she answered him indifferently enough. \"Probably\nin London, amongst the spectators of some pageant arranged in honor of\nthe princess, your wife, sir,\" she said carelessly. \"I had twice the\nfortune to see the Lady Rebekah passing through the streets.\"\n\n\"Not in the streets only,\" he said courteously. \"I remember now: 't\nwas at my lord bishop's dinner. A very courtly company it was. You were\nlaughing with my Lord Rich. You wore pearls in your hair\"--\n\nShe met his gaze fully and boldly. \"Memory plays us strange tricks at\ntimes,\" she told him in a clear, slightly raised voice, \"and it hath\nbeen three years since Master Rolfe and his Indian princess were in\nLondon. His memory hath played him false.\"\n\nShe took her seat in the great chair which stood in the centre of the\nroom, bathed in the sunlight, and the negress brought a cushion for her\nfeet. It was not until this was done, and until she had resigned her fan\nto the slave, who stood behind her slowly waving the plumed toy to and\nfro, that she turned her lovely face upon us and bade us be seated.\n\nAn hour later a whippoorwill uttered its cry close to the window,\nthrough which now shone the crescent moon. Rolfe started up. \"Beshrew\nme! but I had forgot that I am to sleep at Chaplain's to-night. I must\nhurry on.\"\n\nI rose, also. \"You have had no supper!\" I cried. \"I too have forgotten.\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"I cannot wait. Moreover, I have feasted,--yea, and\ndrunk deep.\"\n\nHis eyes were very bright, with an exaltation in them as of wine.\nMine, I felt, had the same light. Indeed, we were both drunk with her\nlaughter, her beauty, and her wit. When he had kissed her hand, and\nI had followed him out of the house and down the bank, he broke the\nsilence.\n\n\"Why she came to Virginia I do not know \"--\n\n\"Nor care to ask,\" I said.\n\n\"Nor care to ask,\" he repeated, meeting my gaze. \"And I know neither her\nname nor her rank. But as I stand here, Ralph, I saw her, a guest, at\nthat feast of which I spoke; and Edwyn Sandys picked not his maids from\nsuch assemblies.\"\n\nI stopped him with my hand upon his shoulder. \"She is one of Sandys'\nmaids,\" I asserted, with deliberation, \"a waiting damsel who wearied of\nservice and came to Virginia to better herself. She was landed with her\nmates at Jamestown a week or more agone, went with them to church and\nthence to the courting meadow, where she and Captain Ralph Percy, a\ngentleman adventurer, so pleased each other that they were married\nforthwith. That same day he brought her to his house, where she now\nabides, his wife, and as such to be honored by those who call themselves\nhis friends. And she is not to be lightly spoken of, nor comment\npassed upon her grace, beauty, and bearing (something too great for her\nstation, I admit), lest idle tales should get abroad.\"\n\n\"Am I not thy friend, Ralph?\" he asked with smiling eyes.\n\n\"I have thought so at times,\" I answered.\n\n\"My friend's honor is my honor,\" he went on. \"Where his lips are sealed\nmine open not. Art content?\"\n\n\"Content,\" I said, and pressed the hand he held out to me.\n\nWe reached the steps of the wharf, and descending them he entered his\nbarge, rocking lazily with the advancing tide. His rowers cast loose\nfrom the piles, and the black water slowly widened between us. From over\nmy shoulder came a sudden bright gleam of light from the house above,\nand I knew that Mistress Percy was as usual wasting good pine knots. I\nhad a vision of the many lights within, and of the beauty whom the world\ncalled my wife, sitting erect, bathed in that rosy glow, in the great\narmchair, with the turbaned negress behind her. I suppose Rolfe saw the\nsame thing, for he looked from the light to me, and I heard him draw his\nbreath.\n\n\"Ralph Percy, thou art the very button upon the cap of Fortune,\" he\nsaid.\n\nTo myself my laugh sounded something of the bitterest, but to him, I\npresume, it vaunted my return through the darkness to the lit room and\nits resplendent pearl. He waved farewell, and the dusk swallowed up him\nand his boat. I went back to the house and to her.\n\nShe was sitting as we had left her, with her small feet crossed upon the\ncushion beneath them, her hands folded in her silken lap, the air from\nthe waving fan blowing tendrils of her dark hair against her delicate\nstanding ruff. I went and leaned against the window, facing her.\n\n\"I have been chosen Burgess for this hundred,\" I said abruptly. \"The\nAssembly meets next week. I must be in Jamestown then and for some time\nto come.\"\n\nShe took the fan from the negress, and waved it lazily to and fro. \"When\ndo we go?\" she asked at last.\n\n\"We!\" I answered. \"I had thought to go alone.\"\n\nThe fan dropped to the floor, and her eyes opened wide. \"And leave me\nhere!\" she exclaimed. \"Leave me in these woods, at the mercy of Indians,\nwolves, and your rabble of servants!\"\n\nI smiled. \"We are at peace with the Indians; it would be a stout wolf\nthat could leap this palisade; and the servants know their master too\nwell to care to offend their mistress. Moreover, I would leave Diccon in\ncharge.\"\n\n\"Diccon!\" she cried. \"The old woman in the kitchen hath told me tales of\nDiccon! Diccon Bravo! Diccon Gamester! Diccon Cutthroat!\"\n\n\"Granted,\" I said. \"But Diccon Faithful as well. I can trust him.\"\n\n\"But I do not trust him!\" she retorted. \"And I wish to go to Jamestown.\nThis forest wearies me.\" Her tone was imperious.\n\n\"I must think it over,\" I said coolly. \"I may take you, or I may not. I\ncannot tell yet.\"\n\n\"But I desire to go, sir!\"\n\n\"And I may desire you to stay.\"\n\n\"You are a churl!\"\n\nI bowed. \"I am the man of your choice, madam.\"\n\nShe rose with a stamp of her foot, and, turning her back upon me, took\na flower from the table and commenced to pull from it its petals. I\nunsheathed my sword, and, seating myself, began to polish away a speck\nof rust upon the blade. Ten minutes later I looked up from the task,\nto receive full in my face a red rose tossed from the other side of the\nroom. The missile was followed by an enchanting burst of laughter.\n\n\"We cannot afford to quarrel, can we?\" cried Mistress Jocelyn Percy.\n\"Life is sad enough in this solitude without that. Nothing but trees and\nwater all day long, and not a soul to speak to! And I am horribly afraid\nof the Indians! What if they were to kill me while you were away? You\nknow you swore before the minister to protect me. You won't leave me to\nthe mercies of the savages, will you? And I may go to Jamestown, may n't\nI? I want to go to church. I want to go to the Governor's house. I want\nto buy a many things. I have gold in plenty, and but this one decent\ndress. You'll take me with you, won't you?\"\n\n\"There's not your like in Virginia,\" I told her. \"If you go to town clad\nlike that and with that bearing, there will be talk enough. And ships\ncome and go, and there are those besides Rolfe who have been to London.\"\n\nFor a moment the laughter died from her eyes and lips, but it returned.\n\"Let them talk,\" she said. \"What care I? And I do not think your ship\ncaptains, your traders and adventurers, do often dine with my lord\nbishop. This barbarous forest world and another world that I wot of are\nso far apart that the inhabitants of the one do not trouble those of the\nother. In that petty village down there I am safe enough. Besides, sir,\nyou wear a sword.\"\n\n\"My sword is ever at your service, madam.\"\n\n\"Then I may go to Jamestown?\"\n\n\"If you will it so.\"\n\nWith her bright eyes upon me, and with one hand softly striking a rose\nagainst her laughing lips, she extended the other hand.\n\n\"You may kiss it, if you wish, sir,\" she said demurely.\n\nI knelt and kissed the white fingers, and four days later we went to\nJamestown.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI IN WHICH WE GO TO JAMESTOWN\n\n\nIT was early morning when we set out on horseback for Jamestown. I rode\nin front, with Mistress Percy upon a pillion behind me, and Diccon on\nthe brown mare brought up the rear. The negress and the mails I had sent\nby boat.\n\nNow, a ride through the green wood with a noble horse beneath you, and\naround you the freshness of the morn, is pleasant enough. Each twig had\nits row of diamonds, and the wet leaves that we pushed aside spilled\ngems upon us. The horses set their hoofs daintily upon fern and moss\nand lush grass. In the purple distances deer stood at gaze, the air rang\nwith innumerable bird notes, clear and sweet, squirrels chattered, bees\nhummed, and through the thick leafy roof of the forest the sun showered\ngold dust. And Mistress Jocelyn Percy was as merry as the morning. It\nwas now fourteen days since she and I had first met, and in that time\nI had found in her thrice that number of moods. She could be as gay and\nsweet as the morning, as dark and vengeful as the storms that came up of\nafternoons, pensive as the twilight, stately as the night,--in her there\nmet a hundred minds. Also she could be childishly frank--and tell you\nnothing.\n\nTo-day she chose to be gracious. Ten times in an hour Diccon was off\nhis horse to pluck this or that flower that her white forefinger pointed\nout. She wove the blooms into a chaplet, and placed it upon her head;\nshe filled her lap with trailers of the vine that swayed against us, and\nstained her fingers and lips with the berries Diccon brought her; she\nlaughed at the squirrels, at the scurrying partridges, at the turkeys\nthat crossed our path, at the fish that leaped from the brooks, at old\nJocomb and his sons who ferried us across the Chickahominy. She was\ncurious concerning the musket I carried; and when, in an open space in\nthe wood, we saw an eagle perched upon a blasted pine, she demanded my\npistol. I took it from my belt and gave it to her, with a laugh. \"I will\neat all of your killing,\" I said.\n\nShe aimed the weapon. \"A wager!\" she declared. \"There be mercers in\nJamestown? If I hit, thou 'lt buy me a pearl hatband?\"\n\n\"Two.\"\n\nShe fired, and the bird rose with a scream of wrath and sailed away. But\ntwo or three feathers came floating to the ground, and when Diccon had\nbrought them to her she pointed triumphantly to the blood upon them.\n\"You said two!\" she cried.\n\nThe sun rose higher, and the heat of the day set in. Mistress Percy's\ninterest in forest bloom and creature flagged. Instead of laughter, we\nhad sighs at the length of way; the vines slid from her lap, and she\ntook the faded flowers from her head and cast them aside. She talked no\nmore, and by and by I felt her head droop against my shoulder.\n\n\"Madam is asleep,\" said Diccon's voice behind me.\n\n\"Ay,\" I answered. \"She'll find a jack of mail but a hard pillow. And\nlook to her that she does not fall.\"\n\n\"I had best walk beside you, then,\" he said.\n\nI nodded, and he dismounted, and throwing the mare's bridle over his arm\nstrode on beside us, with his hand upon the frame of the pillion. Ten\nminutes passed, the last five of which I rode with my face over my\nshoulder. \"Diccon!\" I cried at last, sharply.\n\nHe came to his senses with a start. \"Ay, sir?\" he questioned, his face\ndark red.\n\n\"Suppose you look at me for a change,\" I said. \"How long since Dale came\nin, Diccon?\"\n\n\"Ten years, sir.\"\n\n\"Before we enter Jamestown we'll pass through a certain field and\nbeneath a certain tree. Do you remember what happened there, some years\nago?\"\n\n\"I am not like to forget, sir. You saved me from the wheel.\"\n\n\"Upon which you were bound, ready to be broken for drunkenness, gaming,\nand loose living. I begged your life from Dale for no other reason, I\nthink, than that you had been a horse-boy in my old company in the Low\nCountries. God wot, the life was scarcely worth the saving!\"\n\n\"I know it, sir.\"\n\n\"Dale would not let you go scot-free, but would sell you into slavery.\nAt your own entreaty I bought you, since when you have served me\nindifferently well. You have showed small penitence for past misdeeds,\nand your amendment hath been of yet lesser bulk. A hardy rogue thou wast\nborn, and a rogue thou wilt remain to the end of time. But we have lived\nand hunted, fought and bled together, and in our own fashion I think we\nbear each other good will,--even some love. I have winked at much, have\nshielded you in much, perhaps. In return I have demanded one thing,\nwhich if you had not given I would have found you another Dale to deal\nwith.\"\n\n\"Have I ever refused it, my captain?\"\n\n\"Not yet. Take your hand from that pillion and hold it up; then say\nafter me these words: 'This lady is my mistress, my master's wife, to be\nby me reverenced as such. Her face is not for my eyes nor her hand for\nmy lips. If I keep not myself clean of all offense toward her, may God\napprove that which my master shall do!'\"\n\nThe blood rushed to his face. I watched his fingers slowly loosening\ntheir grasp.\n\n\"Tardy obedience is of the house of mutiny,\" I said sternly. \"Will you,\nsirrah, or will you not?\"\n\nHe raised his hand and repeated the words.\n\n\"Now hold her as before,\" I ordered, and, straightening myself in the\nsaddle, rode on, with my eyes once more on the path before me.\n\nA mile further on, Mistress Percy stirred and raised her head from my\nshoulder. \"Not at Jamestown yet?\" she sighed, as yet but half awake.\n\"Oh, the endless trees! I dreamed I was hawking at Windsor, and then\nsuddenly I was here in this forest, a bird, happy because I was free;\nand then a falcon came swooping down upon me,--it had me in its talons,\nand I changed to myself again, and it changed to--What am I saying? I am\ntalking in my sleep. Who is that singing?\"\n\nIn fact, from the woods in front of us, and not a bowshot away, rang out\na powerful voice:--\n\n    \"'In the merry month of May,\n\n     In a morn by break of day,\n\n     With a troop of damsels playing\n\nForth I went, forsooth, a-maying;'\" and presently, the trees thinning\nin front of us, we came upon a little open glade and upon the singer. He\nlay on his back, on the soft turf beneath an oak, with his hands clasped\nbehind his head and his eyes upturned to the blue sky showing between\nleaf and branch. On one knee crossed above the other sat a squirrel with\na nut in its paws, and half a dozen others scampered here and there over\nhis great body, like so many frolicsome kittens. At a little distance\ngrazed an old horse, gray and gaunt, springhalt and spavined, with ribs\nlike Death's own. Its saddle and bridle adorned a limb of the oak.\n\nThe song went cheerfully on:--\n\n    \"'Much ado there was, God wot:\n\n     would love and she would not;\n\n     said, \"Never man was true.\"\n\n     He said, \"None was false to you.\"'\"\n\n\"Give you good-day, reverend sir!\" I called. \"Art conning next Sunday's\nhymn?\"\n\nNothing abashed, Master Jeremy Sparrow gently shook off the squirrels,\nand getting to his feet advanced to meet us.\n\n\"A toy,\" he declared, with a wave of his hand, \"a trifle, a silly old\nsong that came into my mind unawares, the leaves being so green and the\nsky so blue. Had you come a little earlier or a little later, you would\nhave heard the ninetieth psalm. Give you good-day madam. I must have\nsung for that the very queen of May was coming by.\"\n\n\"Art on your way to Jamestown?\" I demanded. \"Come ride with us. Diccon,\nsaddle his reverence's horse.\"\n\n\"Saddle him an thou wilt, friend,\" said Master Sparrow, \"for he and I\nhave idled long enough, but I fear I cannot keep pace with this fair\ncompany. I and the horse are footing it together.\"\n\n\"He is not long for this world,\" I remarked, eyeing his ill-favored\nsteed, \"but neither are we far from Jamestown. He'll last that far.\"\n\nMaster Sparrow shook his head, with a rueful countenance. \"I bought him\nfrom one of the French vignerons below Westover,\" he said. \"The fellow\nwas astride the poor creature, beating him with a club because he could\nnot go. I laid Monsieur Crapaud in the dust, after which we compounded,\nhe for my purse, I for the animal; since when the poor beast and I have\ntramped it together, for I could not in conscience ride him. Have you\nread me Aesop's fables, Captain Percy?\"\n\n\"I remember the man, the boy, and the ass,\" I replied. \"The ass came\nto grief in the end. Put thy scruples in thy pocket, man, and mount thy\npale horse.\"\n\n\"Not I!\" he said, with a smile. \"'T is a thousand pities, Captain Percy,\nthat a small, mean, and squeamish spirit like mine should be cased like\na very Guy of Warwick. Now, if I were slight of body, or even if I were\nno heavier than your servant there\"--\n\n\"Oh!\" I said. \"Diccon, give his reverence the mare, and do you mount his\nhorse and bring him slowly on to town. If he will not carry you, you can\nlead him in.\"\n\nSunshine revisited the countenance of Master Jeremy Sparrow; he swung\nhis great body into the saddle, gathered up the reins, and made the mare\nto caracole across the path for very joy.\n\n\"Have a care of the poor brute, friend!\" he cried genially to Diccon,\nwhose looks were of the sulkiest. \"Bring him gently on, and leave him at\nMaster Bucke's, near to the church.\"\n\n\"What do you do at Jamestown?\" I asked, as we passed from out the\nglade into the gloom of a pine wood. \"I was told that you were gone to\nHenricus, to help Master Thorpe convert the Indians.\"\n\n\"Ay,\" he answered, \"I did go. I had a call,--I was sure I had a call.\nI thought of myself as a very apostle to the Gentiles. I went from\nHenricus one day's journey into the wilderness, with none but an Indian\nlad for interpreter, and coming to an Indian village gathered its\ninhabitants about me, and sitting down upon a hillock read and expounded\nto them the Sermon on the Mount. I was much edified by the solemnity of\ntheir demeanor and the earnestness of their attention, and had\nconceived great hopes for their spiritual welfare, when, the reading\nand exhortation being finished, one of their old men arose and made me\na long speech, which I could not well understand, but took to be one\nof grateful welcome to myself and my tidings of peace and good will.\nHe then desired me to tarry with them, and to be present at some\nentertainment or other, the nature of which I could not make out. I\ntarried; and toward evening they conducted me with much ceremony to an\nopen space in the midst of the village. There I found planted in the\nground a thick stake, and around it a ring of flaming brushwood. To\nthe stake was fastened an Indian warrior, captured, so my interpreter\ninformed me, from some hostile tribe above the falls. His arms and\nankles were secured to the stake by means of thongs passed through\nincisions in the flesh; his body was stuck over with countless pine\nsplinters, each burning like a miniature torch; and on his shaven crown\nwas tied a thin plate of copper heaped with red-hot coals. A little to\none side appeared another stake and another circle of brushwood: the one\nwith nothing tied to it as yet, and the other still unlit. My friend, I\ndid not tarry to see it lit. I tore a branch from an oak, and I became\nas Samson with the jaw bone of the ass. I fell upon and smote those\nPhilistines. Their wretched victim was beyond all human help, but I\ndearly avenged him upon his enemies. And they had their pains for naught\nwhen they planted that second stake and laid the brush for their hell\nfire. At last I dropped into the stream upon which their damnable\nvillage was situate, and got safely away. Next day I went to George\nThorpe and resigned my ministry, telling him that we were nowhere\ncommanded to preach to devils; when the Company was ready to send shot\nand steel amongst them, they might count upon me. After which I came\ndown the river to Jamestown, where I found worthy Master Bucke well-nigh\ndespaired of with the fever. Finally he was taken up river for change of\nair, and, for lack of worthier substitute, the Governor and Captain West\nconstrained me to remain and minister to the shepherdless flock. Where\nwill you lodge, good sir?\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" I said. \"The town will be full, and the guest house is\nnot yet finished.\"\n\n\"Why not come to me?\" he asked. \"There are none in the minister's house\nbut me and Goodwife Allen who keeps it. There are five fair large rooms\nand a goodly garden, though the trees do too much shadow the house. If\nyou will come and let the sunshine in,\"--a bow and smile for madam,--\"I\nshall be your debtor.\"\n\nHis plea pleased me well. Except the Governor's and Captain West's, the\nminister's house was the best in the town. It was retired, too, being\nset in its own grounds, and not upon the street, and I desired privacy.\nGoodwife Allen was stolid and incurious. Moreover, I liked Master Jeremy\nSparrow.\n\nI accepted his hospitality and gave him thanks. He waved them away, and\nfell to complimenting Mistress Percy, who was pleased to be gracious to\nus both. Well content for the moment with the world and ourselves, we\nfared on through the alternating sunshine and shade, and were happy\nwith the careless inhabitants of the forest. Oversoon we came to the\npeninsula, and crossed the neck of land. Before us lay the town: to\nthe outer eye a poor and mean village, indeed, but to the inner the\nstronghold and capital of our race in the western world, the germ from\nwhich might spring stately cities, the newborn babe which might in time\nequal its parent in stature, strength, and comeliness. So I and a few\nbesides, both in Virginia and at home, viewed the mean houses, the\npoor church and rude fort, and loved the spot which had witnessed much\nsuffering and small joy, but which held within it the future, which was\neven now a bit in the mouth of Spain, a thing in itself outweighing all\nthe toil and anguish of our planting. But there were others who saw only\nthe meanness of the place, its almost defenselessness, its fluxes and\nfevers, the fewness of its inhabitants and the number of its graves.\nFinding no gold and no earthly paradise, and that in the sweat of their\nbrow they must eat their bread, they straightway fell into the dumps,\nand either died out of sheer perversity, or went yelping home to the\nCompany with all manner of dismal tales,--which tales, through my Lord\nWarwick's good offices, never failed to reach the sacred ears of his\nMajesty, and to bring the colony and the Company into disfavor.\n\nWe came to the palisade, and found the gates wide open and the warder\ngone.\n\n\"Where be the people?\" marveled Master Sparrow, as we rode through\ninto the street. In truth, where were the people? On either side of the\nstreet the doors of the houses stood open, but no person looked out from\nthem or loitered on the doorsteps; the square was empty; there were no\nwomen at the well, no children underfoot, no gaping crowd before gaol\nand pillory, no guard before the Governor's house,--not a soul, high or\nlow, to be seen.\n\n\"Have they all migrated?\" cried Sparrow. \"Are they gone to Croatan?\"\n\n\"They have left one to tell the tale, then,\" I said, \"for here he comes\nrunning.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII IN WHICH WE PREPARE TO FIGHT THE SPANIARD\n\n\nA MAN came panting down the street. \"Captain Ralph Percy!\" he cried.\n\"My master said it was your horse coming across the neck. The Governor\ncommands your attendance at once, sir.\"\n\n\"Where is the Governor? Where are all the people?\" I demanded.\n\n\"At the fort. They are all at the fort or on the bank below. Oh, sirs, a\nwoeful day for us all!\"\n\n\"A woeful day!\" I exclaimed. \"What's the matter?\"\n\nThe man, whom I recognized as one of the commander's servants, a fellow\nwith the soul of a French valet de chambre, was wild with terror.\n\n\"They are at the guns!\" he quavered. \"Alackaday! what can a few sakers\nand demiculverins do against them?\"\n\n\"Against whom?\" I cried.\n\n\"They are giving out pikes and cutlasses! Woe's me, the sight of naked\nsteel hath ever made me sick!\"\n\nI drew my dagger, and flashed it before him. \"Does 't make you sick?\" I\nasked. \"You shall be sicker yet, if you do not speak to some purpose.\"\n\nThe fellow shrank back, his eyeballs starting from his head.\n\n\"It's a tall ship,\" he gasped, \"a very big ship! It hath ten culverins,\nbeside fowlers and murderers, sabers, falcons, and bases!\"\n\nI took him by the collar and shook him off his feet.\n\n\"There are priests on board!\" he managed to say as I set him down. \"This\ntime to-morrrow we'll all be on the rack! And next week the galleys will\nhave us!\"\n\n\"It's the Spaniard at last,\" I said. \"Come on!\"\n\nWhen we reached the river bank before the fort, it was to find confusion\nworse confounded. The gates of the palisade were open, and through them\nstreamed Councilors, Burgesses, and officers, while the bank itself was\nthronged with the generality. Ancient planters, Smith's men, Dale's men,\ntenants and servants, women and children, including the little eyases we\nimported the year before, negroes, Paspaheghs, French vignerons, Dutch\nsawmill men, Italian glassworkers,--all seethed to and fro, all talked\nat once, and all looked down the river. Out of the babel of voices these\nwords came to us over and over: \"The Spaniard!\" \"The Inquisition!\" \"The\ngalleys!\" They were the words oftenest heard at that time, when strange\nsails hove in sight.\n\nBut where was the Spaniard? On the river, hugging the shore, were many\nsmall craft, barges, shallops, sloops, and pinnaces, and beyond them the\nmasts of the Truelove, the Due Return, and the Tiger, then in port; on\nthese three, of which the largest, the Due Return, was of but eighty\ntons burthen, the mariners were running about and the masters bawling\norders. But there was no other ship, no bark, galleon, or man-of-war,\nwith three tiers of grinning ordnance, and the hated yellow flag\nflaunting above.\n\nI sprang from my horse, and, leaving it and Mistress Percy in Sparrow's\ncharge, hastened up to the fort. As I passed through the palisade I\nheard my name called, and turning waited for Master Pory to come up. He\nwas panting and puffing, his jovial face very red.\n\n\"I was across the neck of land when I heard the news,\" he said. \"I ran\nall the way, and am somewhat scant of breath. Here's the devil to pay!\"\n\n\"It looks another mare's-nest,\" I replied. \"We have cried 'Spaniard!'\npretty often.\"\n\n\"But this time the wolf's here,\" he answered. \"Davies sent a horseman at\na gallop from Algernon with the tidings. He passed the ship, and it was\na very great one. We may thank this dead calm that it did not catch us\nunawares.\"\n\nWithin the palisade was noise enough, but more order than without. On\nthe half-moons commanding the river, gunners were busy about our sakers,\nfalcons, and three culverins. In one place, West, the commander, was\ngiving out brigandines, jacks, skulls, muskets, halberds, swords, and\nlongbows; in another, his wife, who was a very Mary Ambree, supervised\nthe boiling of a great caldron of pitch. Each loophole in palisade and\nfort had already its marksman. Through the west port came a horde of\nreluctant invaders,--cattle, swine, and poultry,--driven in by yelling\nboys.\n\nI made my way through the press to where I saw the Governor, surrounded\nby Councilors and Burgesses, sitting on a keg of powder, and issuing\norders at the top of his voice. \"Ha, Captain Percy!\" he cried, as I came\nup. \"You are in good time, man! You've served your apprenticeship at the\nwars. You must teach us how to beat the dons.\"\n\n\"To Englishmen, that comes by nature, sir,\" I said. \"Art sure we are to\nhave the pleasure?\"\n\n\"Not a doubt of it this time,\" he answered. \"The ship slipped in past\nthe Point last night. Davies signaled her to stop, and then sent a ball\nover her; but she kept on. True, it was too dark to make out much; but\nif she were friendly, why did she not stop for castle duties? Moreover,\nthey say she was of at least five hundred tons, and no ship of that size\nhath ever visited these waters. There was no wind, and they sent a man\non at once, hoping to outstrip the enemy and warn us. The man changed\nhorses at Basse's Choice, and passed the ship about dawn. All he could\ntell for the mist was that it was a very great ship, with three tiers of\nguns.\"\n\n\"The flag?\"\n\n\"She carried none.\"\n\n\"Humph!\" I said. \"It hath a suspicious look. At least we do well to be\nready. We'll give them a warm welcome.\"\n\n\"There are those here who counsel surrender,\" continued the Governor.\n\"There's one, at least, who wants the Tiger sent downstream with a white\nflag and my sword.\"\n\n\"Where?\" I cried. \"He's no Englishman, I warrant!\"\n\n\"As much an Englishman as thou, sir!\" called out a gentleman whom I had\nencountered before, to wit, Master Edward Sharpless. \"It's well enough\nfor swingebuckler captains, Low Country fire-eaters, to talk of holding\nout againt a Spanish man-of-war with twice our number of fighting men,\nand enough ordnance to batter the town out of existence. Wise men know\nwhen the odds are too heavy!\"\n\n\"It's well enough for lily-livered, goose-fleshed lawyers to hold their\ntongues when men and soldiers talk,\" I retorted. \"We are not making\nindentures to the devil, and so have no need of such gentry.\"\n\nThere was a roar of laughter from the captains and gunners, but terror\nof the Spaniard had made Master Edward Sharpless bold to all besides.\n\n\"They will wipe us off the face of the earth!\" he lamented. \"There won't\nbe an Englishman left in America! they'll come close in upon us! they'll\nbatter down the fort with their culverins; they'll turn all their\nswivels, sakers, and falcons upon us; they'll throw into our midst\nstinkpots and grenades; they'll mow us down with chain shot! Their\ngunners never miss!\" His voice rose to a scream, and he shook as with\nan ague. \"Are you mad? It's Spain that's to be fought! Spain the rich!\nSpain the powerful! Spain the lord of the New World!\"\n\n\"It's England that fights!\" I cried. \"For very shame, hold thy tongue!\"\n\n\"If we surrender at once, they'll let us go!\" he whined. \"We can take\nthe small boats and get to the Bermudas, they'll let us go.\"\n\n\"Into the galleys,\" muttered West.\n\nThe craven tried another feint. \"Think of the women and children!\"\n\n\"We do,\" I said sternly. \"Silence, fool!\"\n\nThe Governor, a brave and honest man, rose from the keg of powder. \"All\nthis is foreign to the matter, Master Sharpless. I think our duty is\nclear, be the odds what they may. This is our post, and we will hold it\nor die beside it. We are few in number, but we are England in America,\nand I think we will remain here. This is the King's fifth kingdom, and\nwe will keep it for him. We will trust in the Lord and fight it out.\"\n\n\"Amen,\" I said, and \"Amen,\" said the ring of Councilors and Burgesses\nand the armed men beyond.\n\nThe hum of voices now rose into excited cries, and the watchman\nstationed atop the big culverin called out, \"Sail ho!\" With one accord\nwe turned our faces downstream. There was the ship, undoubtedly.\nMoreover, a strong breeze had sprung up, blowing from the sea, filling\nher white sails, and rapidly lessening the distance between us. As yet\nwe could only tell that she was indeed a large ship with all sail set.\n\nThrough the gates of the palisade now came, pellmell, the crowd without.\nIn ten minutes' time the women were in line ready to load the muskets,\nthe children sheltered as best they might be, the men in ranks, the\ngunners at their guns, and the flag up. I had run it up with my own\nhand, and as I stood beneath the folds Master Sparrow and my wife came\nto my side.\n\n\"The women are over there,\" I said to the latter, \"where you had best\nbetake yourself.\"\n\n\"I prefer to stay here,\" she answered. \"I am not afraid.\" Her color was\nhigh, and she held her head up. \"My father fought the Armada,\" she said.\n\n\"Get me a sword from that man who is giving them out.\"\n\nFrom his coign of vantage the watch now called out: \"She's a long\nship,--five hundred tons, anyhow! Lord! the metal that she carries!\nShe's rasedecked!\"\n\n\"Then she's Spanish, sure enough!\" cried the Governor.\n\nFrom the crowd of servants, felons, and foreigners rose a great clamor,\nand presently we made out Sharpless perched on a cask in their midst and\nwildly gesticulating.\n\n\"The Tiger, the Truelove, and the Due Return have swung across channel!\"\nannounced the watch. \"They 've trained their guns on the Spaniard!\"\n\nThe Englishmen cheered, but the bastard crew about Sharpless groaned.\nExtreme fear had made the lawyer shameless. \"What guns have those\nboats?\" he screamed. \"Two falcons apiece and a handful of muskets, and\nthey go out against a man-of-war! She'll trample them underfoot! She'll\nsink them with a shot apiece! The Tiger is forty tons, and the Truelove\nis sixty. You 're all mad!\"\n\n\"Sometimes quality beats quantity,\" said West.\n\n\"Didst ever hear of the Content?\" sang out a gunner.\n\n\"Or of the Merchant Royal?\" cried another.\n\n\"Or of the Revenge?\" quoth Master Jeremy Sparrow. \"Go hang thyself,\ncoward, or, if you choose, swim out to the Spaniard, and shift from thy\nwet doublet and hose into a sanbenito. Let the don come, shoot if he\ncan, and land if he will! We'll singe his beard in Virginia as we did at\nCales!\n\n    'The great St. Philip, the pride of the Spaniards,\n\n     Was burnt to the bottom and sunk in the sea.\n\n     the St. Andrew and eke the St. Matthew\n\n     We took in fight manfully and brought away.'\n\nAnd so we'll do with this one, my masters! We'll sink her, or we'll take\nher and send her against her own galleons and galleasses!\n\n    'Dub-a-dub, dub-a-dub, thus strike their drums,\n\n    Tantara, tantara, the Englishman comes!'\"\n\nHis great voice and great presence seized and held the attention of all.\nOver his doublet of rusty black he had clapped a yet rustier back and\nbreast; on his bushy hair rode a headpiece many sizes too small; by his\nside was an old broadsword, and over his shoulder a pike. Suddenly, from\ngay hardihood his countenance changed to an expression more befitting\nhis calling. \"Our cause is just, my masters!\" he cried. \"We stand here\nnot for England alone; we stand for the love of law, for the love of\nliberty, for the fear of God, who will not desert his servants and his\ncause, nor give over to Anti-Christ this virgin world. This plantation\nis the leaven which is to leaven the whole lump, and surely he will\nhide it in the hollow of his hand and in the shadow of his wing. God of\nbattles, hear us! God of England, God of America, aid the children of\nthe one, the saviors of the other!\"\n\nHe had dropped the pike to raise his clasped hands to the blue heavens,\nbut now he lifted it again, threw back his shoulders, and flung up his\nhead. He laid his hand on the flagstaff, and looked up to the banner\nstreaming in the breeze. \"It looks well so high against the blue, does\nn't it, friends?\" he cried genially. \"Suppose we keep it there forever\nand a day!\"\n\nA cheer arose, so loud that it silenced, if it did not convince, the\ncraven few. As for Master Edward Sharpless, he disappeared behind the\nline of women.\n\nThe great ship came steadily on, her white sails growing larger and\nlarger, moment by moment, her tiers of guns more distinct and menacing,\nher whole aspect more defiant. Her waist seemed packed with men. But no\nstreamers, no flag.\n\nA puff of smoke floated up from the deck of the Tiger, and a ball from\none of her two tiny falcons passed through the stranger's rigging. A\ncheer for the brave little cockboat arose from the English. \"David\nand his pebble!\" exclaimed Master Jeremy Sparrow. \"Now for Goliath's\ntwenty-pounders!\"\n\nBut no flame and thunder issued from the guns aboard the stranger.\nInstead, from her deck there came to us what sounded mightily like\na roar of laughter. Suddenly, from each masthead and yard shot out\nstreamers of red and blue, up from the poop rose and flaunted in the\nwind the crosses of St. George and St. Andrew, and with a crash trumpet,\ndrum, and fife rushed into\n\n     \"Here's to jolly good ale and old!\"\n\n\"By the Lord, she's English!\" shouted the Governor.\n\nOn she came, banners flying, music playing, and inextinguishable\nlaughter rising from her decks. The Tiger, the Truelove, and the Due\nReturn sent no more hailstones against her; they turned and resolved\nthemselves into her consort. The watch, a grim old sea dog that had\ncome in with Dale, swung himself down from his post, and came toward\nthe Governor at a run. \"I know her now, sir!\" he shouted. \"I was at the\nwinning of Cales, and she's the Santa Teresa, that we took and sent home\nto the Queen. She was Spanish once, sir, but she's English now.\"\n\nThe gates were flung open, and the excited people poured out again\nupon the river bank. I found myself beside the Governor, whose honest\ncountenance wore an expression of profound bewilderment.\n\n\"What d' ye make of her, Percy?\" he said. \"The Company does n't send\nservants, felons, 'prentices, or maids in such craft; no, nor officers\nor governors, either. It's the King's ship, sure enough, but what is she\ndoing here?--that 's the question. What does she want, and whom does she\nbring?\"\n\n\"We'll soon know,\" I answered, \"for there goes her anchor.\"\n\nFive minutes later a boat was lowered from the ship, and came swiftly\ntoward us. The boat had four rowers, and in the stern sat a tall man,\nblack-bearded, high-colored, and magnificently dressed. It touched the\nsand some two hundred feet from the spot where Governor, Councilors,\nofficers, and a sprinkling of other sorts stood staring at it, and at\nthe great ship beyond. The man in the stern leaped out, looked around\nhim, and then walked toward us. As he walked slowly, we had leisure to\nnote the richness of his doublet and cloak,--the one slashed, the other\nlined with scarlet taffeta,--the arrogance of his mien and gait, and the\nsuperb full-blooded beauty of his face.\n\n\"The handsomest man that ever I saw!\" ejaculated the Governor.\n\nMaster Pory, standing beside him, drew in his breath, then puffed it out\nagain. \"Handsome enough, your Honor,\" he said, \"unless handsome is as\nhandsome does. That, gentlemen, is my Lord Carnal,--that is the King's\nlatest favorite.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII IN WHICH ENTERS MY LORD CARNAL\n\n\nI FELT a touch upon my shoulder, and turned to find Mistress Percy\nbeside me. Her cheeks were white, her eyes aflame, her whole frame\ntense. The passion that dominated her was so clearly anger at white heat\nthat I stared at her in amazement. Her hand slid from my shoulder to the\nbend of my arm and rested there. \"Remember that I am your wife, sir,\"\nshe said in a low, fierce voice,--\"your kind and loving wife. You said\nthat your sword was mine; now bring your wit to the same service!\"\n\nThere was not time to question her meaning. The man whose position in\nthe realm had just been announced by the Secretary, and of whom we had\nall heard as one not unlikely to supplant even Buckingham himself, was\nclose at hand. The Governor, headpiece in hand, stepped forward; the\nother swept off his Spanish hat; both bowed profoundly.\n\n\"I speak to his Honor the Governor of Virginia?\" inquired the newcomer.\nHis tone was offhand, his hat already back upon his head.\n\n\"I am George Yeardley, at my Lord Carnal's service,\" answered the\nGovernor.\n\nThe favorite raised his eyebrows. \"I don't need to introduce myself, it\nseems,\" he said. \"You've found that I am not the devil, after all,--at\nleast not the Spanish Apollyon. Zooks! a hawk above a poultry yard could\nn't have caused a greater commotion than did my poor little ship and my\nfew poor birding pieces! Does every strange sail so put you through your\npaces?\"\n\nThe Governor's color mounted. \"We are not at home,\" he answered stiffly.\n\"Here we are few and weak and surrounded by many dangers, and have need\nto be vigilant, being planted, as it were, in the very grasp of that\nSpain who holds Europe in awe, and who claims this land as her own. That\nwe are here at all is proof enough of our courage, my lord.\"\n\nThe other shrugged his shoulders. \"I don't doubt your mettle,\" he said\nnegligently. \"I dare say it matches your armor.\"\n\nHis glance had rested for a moment upon the battered headpiece and\nancient rusty breastplate with which Master Jeremy Sparrow was bedight.\n\n\"It is something antique, truly, something out of fashion,\" remarked\nthat worthy,--\"almost as out of fashion as courtesy from guests, or\nrespect for dignities from my-face-is-my-fortune minions and lords on\ncarpet considerations.\"\n\nThe hush of consternation following this audacious speech was broken by\na roar of laughter from the favorite himself. \"Zounds!\" he cried, \"your\ncourage is worn on your sleeve, good giant! I'll uphold you to face\nSpaniards, strappado, rack, galleys, and all!\"\n\nThe bravado with which he spoke, the insolence of his bold glance and\ncurled lip, the arrogance with which he flaunted that King's favor which\nshould be a brand more infamous than the hangman's, his beauty, the pomp\nof his dress,--all were alike hateful. I hated him then, scarce knowing\nwhy, as I hated him afterward with reason.\n\nHe now pulled from the breast of his doublet a packet, which he\nproffered the Governor. \"From the King, sir,\" he announced, in the\nhalf-fierce, half--mocking tone he had made his own. \"You may read it at\nyour leisure. He wishes you to further me in a quest upon which I have\ncome.\"\n\nThe Governor took the packet with reverence. \"His Majesty's will is our\nlaw,\" he said. \"Anything that lies in our power, sir; though if you come\nfor gold\"--\n\nThe favorite laughed again. \"I've come for a thing a deal more precious,\nSir Governor,--a thing worth more to me than all the treasure of the\nIndies with Manoa and El Dorado thrown in,--to wit, the thing upon which\nI've set my mind. That which I determine to do, I do, sir, and the thing\nI determine to have, why, sooner or later, by hook or by crook, fair\nmeans or foul, I have it! I am not one to be crossed or defied with\nimpunity.\"\n\n\"I do not take your meaning, my lord,\" said the Governor, puzzled,\nbut courteous. \"There are none here who would care to thwart, in any\nhonorable enterprise, a nobleman so high in the King's favor. I trust\nthat my Lord Carnal will make my poor house his own during his stay in\nVirginia--What's the matter, my lord?\"\n\nMy lord's face was dark red, his black eyes afire, his mustaches working\nup and down. His white teeth had closed with a click on the loud oath\nwhich had interrupted the Governor's speech. Honest Sir George and his\ncircle stared at this unaccountable guest in amazement not unmixed with\ndismay. As for myself, I knew before he spoke what had caused the oath\nand the fierce triumph in that handsome face. Master Jeremy Sparrow had\nmoved a little to one side, thus exposing to view that which his great\nbody had before screened from observation,--namely, Mistress Jocelyn\nPercy.\n\nIn a moment the favorite was before her, hat in hand, bowing to the\nground.\n\n\"My quest hath ended where I feared it but begun!\" he cried, flushed and\nexultant. \"I have found my Manoa sooner than I thought for. Have you no\nwelcome for me, lady?\"\n\nShe withdrew her arm from mine and curtsied to him profoundly; then\nstood erect, indignant and defiant, her eyes angry stars, her cheeks\ncarnation, scorn on her smiling lips.\n\n\"I cannot welcome you as you should be welcomed, my lord,\" she said in a\nclear voice. \"I have but my bare hands. Manoa, my lord, lies far to the\nsouthward. This land is quite out of your course, and you will find here\nbut your travail for your pains. My lord, permit me to present to you my\nhusband, Captain Ralph Percy. I think that you know his cousin, my Lord\nof Northumberland.\"\n\nThe red left the favorite's cheeks, and he moved as though a blow had\nbeen dealt him by some invisible hand. Recovering himself he bowed\nto me, and I to him, which done we looked each other in the eyes long\nenough for each to see the thrown gauntlet.\n\n\"I raise it,\" I said.\n\n\"And I raise it,\" he answered.\n\n\"A l'outrance, I think, sir?\" I continued.\n\n\"A l'outrance,\" he assented.\n\n\"And between us two alone,\" I suggested.\n\nHis answering smile was not good to see, nor was the tone in which he\nspoke to the Governor good to hear.\n\n\"It is now some weeks, sir,\" he said, \"since there disappeared from\ncourt a jewel, a diamond of most inestimable worth. It in some sort\nbelonged to the King, and his Majesty, in the goodness of his heart,\nhad promised it to a certain one,--nay, had sworn by his kingdom that\nit should be his. Well, sir, that man put forth his hand to claim his\nown--when lo! the jewel vanished! Where it went no man could tell. There\nwas, as you may believe, a mighty running up and down and looking into\ndark corners, all for naught,--it was clean gone. But the man to whom\nthat bright gem had been promised was not one easily hoodwinked or\nbaffled. He swore to trace it, follow it, find it, and wear it.\"\n\nHis bold eyes left the Governor, to rest upon the woman beside me; had\nhe pointed to her with his hand, he could not have more surely drawn\nupon her the regard of that motley throng. By degrees the crowd had\nfallen back, leaving us three--the King's minion, the masquerading lady,\nand myself--the centre of a ring of staring faces; but now she became\nthe sole target at which all eyes were directed.\n\nIn Virginia, at this time, the women of our own race were held in high\nesteem. During the first years of our planting they were a greater\nrarity than the mocking-birds and flying squirrels, or than that weed\nthe eating of which made fools of men. The man whose wife was loving and\ndaring enough, or jealous enough of Indian maids, to follow him into\nthe wilderness counted his friends by the score and never lacked for\ncompany. The first marriage in Virginia was between a laborer and a\nwaiting maid, and yet there was as great a deal of candy stuff as if it\nhad been the nuptials of a lieutenant of the shire. The brother of my\nLord de la Warre stood up with the groom, the brother of my Lord of\nNorthumberland gave away the bride and was the first to kiss her, and\nthe President himself held the caudle to their lips that night. Since\nthat wedding there had been others. Gentlewomen made the Virginia voyage\nwith husband or father; women signed as servants and came over, to marry\nin three weeks' time, the husband paying good tobacco for the wife's\nfreedom; in the cargoes of children sent for apprentices there were many\ngirls. And last, but not least, had come Sir Edwyn's doves. Things had\nchanged since that day--at the memory of which men still held their\nsides--when Madam West, then the only woman in the town with youth and\nbeauty, had marched down the street to the pillory, mounted it, called\nto her the drummer, and ordered him to summon to the square by tuck of\ndrum every man in the place. Which done, and the amazed population\nat hand, gaping at the spectacle of the wife of their commander (then\nabsent from home) pilloried before them, she gave command, through\nthe crier, that they should take their fill of gazing, whispering, and\nnudging then and there, forever and a day, and then should go about\ntheir business and give her leave to mind her own.\n\nThat day was gone, but men still dropped their work to see a woman pass,\nstill cheered when a farthingale appeared over a ship's side, and at\nchurch still devoted their eyes to other service than staring at the\nminister. In our short but crowded history few things had made a greater\nstir than the coming in of Sir Edwyn's maids. They were married now,\nbut they were still the observed of all observers; to be pointed out to\nstrangers, run after by children, gaped at by the vulgar, bowed to with\nbroad smiles by Burgess, Councilor, and commander, and openly contemned\nby those dames who had attained to a husband in somewhat more regular\nfashion. Of the ninety who had arrived two weeks before, the greater\nnumber had found husbands in the town itself or in the neighboring\nhundreds, so that in the crowd that had gathered to withstand the\nSpaniard, and had stayed to welcome the King's favorite, there were\nfarthingales not a few.\n\nBut there were none like the woman whose hand I had kissed in the\ncourting meadow. In the throng, that day, in her Puritan dress and amid\nthe crowd of meaner beauties, she had passed without overmuch comment,\nand since that day none had seen her save Rolfe and the minister, my\nservants and myself; and when \"The Spaniard!\" was cried, men thought of\nother things than the beauty of women; so that until this moment she\nhad escaped any special notice. Now all that was changed. The Governor,\nfollowing the pointing of those insolent eyes, fixed his own upon her\nin a stare of sheer amazement; the gold-laced quality about him craned\nnecks, lifted eyebrows, and whispered; and the rabble behind followed\ntheir betters' example with an emphasis quite their own.\n\n\"Where do you suppose that jewel went, Sir Governor,\" said the\nfavorite,--\"that jewel which was overnice to shine at court, which set\nup its will against the King's, which would have none of that one to\nwhom it had been given?\"\n\n\"I am a plain man, my lord,\" replied the Governor bluntly. \"An it please\nyou, give me plain words.\"\n\nMy lord laughed, his eyes traveling round the ring of greedily intent\nfaces. \"So be it, sir,\" he assented. \"May I ask who is this lady?\"\n\n\"She came in the Bonaventure,\" answered the Governor. \"She was one of\nthe treasurer's poor maids.\"\n\n\"With whom I trod a measure at court not long ago,\" said the favorite.\n\"I had to wait for the honor until the prince had been gratified.\"\n\nThe Governor's round eyes grew rounder. Young Hamor, a-tiptoe behind\nhim, drew a long, low whistle.\n\n\"In so small a community,\" went on my lord, \"sure you must all know\none another. There can be no masks worn, no false colors displayed.\nEverything must be as open as daylight. But we all have a past as well\nas a present. Now, for instance\"--\n\nI interrupted him. \"In Virginia, my lord, we live in the present. At\npresent, my lord, I like not the color of your lordship's cloak.\"\n\nHe stared at me, with his black brows drawn together. \"It is not of your\nchoosing nor for your wearing, sir,\" he rejoined haughtily.\n\n\"And your sword knot is villainously tied,\" I continued. \"And I like not\nsuch a fire-new, bejeweled scabbard. Mine, you see, is out at heel.\"\n\n\"I see,\" he said dryly.\n\n\"The pinking of your doublet suits me not, either,\" I declared. \"I could\nmake it more to my liking,\" and I touched his Genoa three-pile with the\npoint of my rapier.\n\nA loud murmur arose from the crowd, and the Governor started forward,\ncrying out, \"Captain Percy! Are you mad?\"\n\n\"I was never saner in my life, sir,\" I answered. \"French fashions like\nme not,--that is all,--nor Englishmen that wear them. To my thinking\nsuch are scarcely true-born.\"\n\nThat thrust went home. All the world knew the story of my late Lord\nCarnal and the waiting woman in the service of the French ambassador's\nwife. A gasp of admiration went up from the crowd. My lord's rapier was\nout, the hand that held it shaking with passion. I had my blade in my\nhand, but the point was upon the ground. \"I'll lesson you, you madman!\"\nhe said thickly. Suddenly, without any warning, he thrust at me; had\nhe been less blind with rage, the long score which each was to run up\nagainst the other might have ended where it began. I swerved, and the\nnext instant with my own point sent his rapier whirling. It fell at the\nGovernor's feet.\n\n\"Your lordship may pick it up,\" I remarked. \"Your grasp is as firm as\nyour honor, my lord.\"\n\nHe glared at me, foam upon his lips. Men were between us now,--the\nGovernor, Francis West, Master Pory, Hamor, Wynne,--and a babel of\nexcited voices arose. The diversion I had aimed to make had been made\nwith a vengeance. West had me by the arm. \"What a murrain is all this\ncoil about, Ralph Percy? If you hurt hair of his head, you are lost!\"\n\nThe favorite broke from the Governor's detaining hand and conciliatory\nspeech.\n\n\"You'll fight, sir?\" he cried hoarsely.\n\n\"You know that I need not now, my lord,\" I answered.\n\nHe stamped upon the ground with rage and shame; not true shame for that\nfoul thrust, but shame for the sword upon the grass, for that which\ncould be read in men's eyes, strive to hide it as they might, for the\nopen scorn upon one face. Then, during the minute or more in which we\nfaced each other in silence, he exerted to some effect that will\nof which he had boasted. The scarlet faded from his face, his frame\nsteadied, and he forced a smile. Also he called to his aid a certain\nsoldierly, honest-seeming frankness of speech and manner which he could\nassume at will.\n\n\"Your Virginian sunshine dazzleth the eyes, sir,\" he said. \"Of a verity\nit made me think you on guard. Forgive me my mistake.\"\n\nI bowed. \"Your lordship will find me at your service. I lodge at the\nminister's house, where your lordship's messenger will find me. I am\ngoing there now with my wife, who hath ridden a score of miles this\nmorning and is weary. We give you good-day, my lord.\"\n\nI bowed to him again and to the Governor, then gave my hand to Mistress\nPercy. The crowd opening before us, we passed through it, and crossed\nthe parade by the west bulwark. At the further end was a bit of rising\nground. This we mounted; then, before descending the other side into the\nlane leading to the minister's house, we turned as by one impulse\nand looked back. Life is like one of those endless Italian corridors,\npainted, picture after picture, by a master hand; and man is the\ntraveler through it, taking his eyes from one scene but to rest them\nupon another. Some remain a blur in his mind; some he remembers not; for\nsome he has but to close his eyes and he sees them again, line for line,\ntint for tint, the whole spirit of the piece. I close my eyes, and I\nsee the sunshine hot and bright, the blue of the skies, the sheen of the\nriver. The sails are white again upon boats long lost; the Santa Teresa,\nsunk in a fight with an Algerine rover two years afterward, rides\nat anchor there forever in the James, her crew in the waist and the\nrigging, her master and his mates on the poop, above them the flag.\nI see the plain at our feet and the crowd beyond, all staring with\nupturned faces; and standing out from the group of perplexed and\nwondering dignitaries a man in black and scarlet, one hand busy at his\nmouth, the other clenched upon the newly restored and unsheathed sword.\nAnd I see, standing on the green hillock, hand in hand, us two, myself\nand the woman so near to me, and yet so far away that a common enemy\nseemed our only tie.\n\nWe turned and descended to the green lane and the deserted houses. When\nwe were quite hidden from those we had left on the bank below the fort,\nshe dropped my hand and moved to the other side of the lane; and thus,\nwith never a word to spare, we walked sedately on until we reached the\nminister's house.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX IN WHICH TWO DRINK OF ONE CUP\n\n\nWAITING for us in the doorway we found Master Jeremy Sparrow, relieved\nof his battered armor, his face wreathed with hospitable smiles, and a\nposy in his hand.\n\n\"When the Spaniard turned out to be only the King's minion, I slipped\naway to see that all was in order,\" he said genially. \"Here are roses,\nmadam, that you are not to treat as you did those others.\"\n\nShe took them from him with a smile, and we went into the house to find\nthree fair large rooms, something bare of furnishing, but clean and\nsweet, with here and there a bow pot of newly gathered flowers, a dish\nof wardens on the table, and a cool air laden with the fragrance of the\npine blowing through the open window.\n\n\"This is your demesne,\" quoth the minister. \"I have worthy Master\nBucke's own chamber upstairs. Ah, good man, I wish he may quickly\nrecover his strength and come back to his own, and so relieve me of the\nburden of all this luxury. I, whom nature meant for an eremite, have no\nbusiness in kings' chambers such as these.\"\n\nHis devout faith in his own distaste for soft living and his longings\nafter a hermit's cell was an edifying spectacle. So was the evident\npride which he took in his domain, the complacence with which he pointed\nout the shady, well-stocked garden, and the delight with which he\nproduced and set upon the table a huge pasty and a flagon of wine.\n\n\"It is a fast day with me,\" he said. \"I may neither eat nor drink until\nthe sun goes down. The flesh is a strong giant, very full of pride and\nlust of living, and the spirit must needs keep watch and ward, seizing\nevery opportunity to mortify and deject its adversary. Goodwife Allen is\nstill gaping with the crowd at the fort, and your man and maid have not\nyet come, but I shall be overhead if you need aught. Mistress Percy must\nwant rest after her ride.\"\n\nHe was gone, leaving us two alone together. She stood opposite me,\nbeside the window, from which she had not moved since entering the room.\nThe color was still in her cheeks, the light in her eyes, and she still\nheld the roses with which Sparrow had heaped her arms. I was moving to\nthe table.\n\n\"Wait!\" she said, and I turned toward her again.\n\n\"Have you no questions to ask?\" she demanded.\n\nI shook my head. \"None, madam.\"\n\n\"I was the King's ward!\" she cried.\n\nI bowed, but spoke no word, though she waited for me.\n\n\"If you will listen,\" she said at last, proudly, and yet with a pleading\nsweetness,--\"if you will listen, I will tell you how it was that I--that\nI came to wrong you so.\"\n\n\"I am listening, madam,\" I replied.\n\nShe stood against the light, the roses pressed to her bosom, her dark\neyes upon me, her head held high. \"My mother died when I was born; my\nfather, years ago. I was the King's ward. While the Queen lived she kept\nme with her,--she loved me, I think; and the King too was kind,--would\nhave me sing to him, and would talk to me about witchcraft and the\nScriptures, and how rebellion to a king is rebellion to God. When I was\nsixteen, and he tendered me marriage with a Scotch lord, I, who loved\nthe gentleman not, never having seen him, prayed the King to take the\nvalue of my marriage and leave me my freedom. He was so good to me then\nthat the Scotch lord was wed elsewhere, and I danced at the wedding with\na mind at ease. Time passed, and the King was still my very good lord.\nThen, one black day, my Lord Carnal came to court, and the King looked\nat him oftener than at his Grace of Buckingham. A few months, and my\nlord's wish was the King's will. To do this new favorite pleasure he\nforgot his ancient kindness of heart; yea, and he made the law of no\naccount. I was his kinswoman, and under my full age; he would give my\nhand to whom he chose. He chose to give it to my Lord Carnal.\"\n\nShe broke off, and turned her face from me toward the slant sunshine\nwithout the window. Thus far she had spoken quietly, with a certain\nproud patience of voice and bearing; but as she stood there in a silence\nwhich I did not break, the memory of her wrongs brought the crimson\nto her cheeks and the anger to her eyes. Suddenly she burst forth\npassionately: \"The King is the King! What is a subject's will to clash\nwith his? What weighs a woman's heart against his whim? Little cared\nhe that my hand held back, grew cold at the touch of that other hand\nin which he would have put it. What matter if my will was against that\nmarriage? It was but the will of a girl, and must be broken. All my\nworld was with the King; I, who stood alone, was but a woman, young and\nuntaught. Oh, they pressed me sore, they angered me to the very heart!\nThere was not one to fight my battle, to help me in that strait, to show\nme a better path than that I took. With all my heart, with all my soul,\nwith all my might, I hate that man which that ship brought here to-day!\nYou know what I did to escape them all, to escape that man. I fled from\nEngland in the dress of my waiting maid and under her name. I came to\nVirginia in that guise. I let myself be put up, appraised, cried for\nsale, in that meadow yonder, as if I had been indeed the piece of\nmerchandise I professed myself. The one man who approached me with\nrespect I gulled and cheated. I let him, a stranger, give me his name. I\nshelter myself now behind his name. I have foisted on him my quarrel.\nI have--Oh, despise me, if you will! You cannot despise me more than I\ndespise myself!\"\n\nI stood with my hand upon the table and my eyes studying the shadow\nof the vines upon the floor. All that she said was perfectly true,\nand yet--I had a vision of a scarlet and black figure and a dark and\nbeautiful face. I too hated my Lord Carnal.\n\n\"I do not despise you, madam,\" I said at last. \"What was done two weeks\nago in the meadow yonder is past recall. Let it rest. What is mine is\nyours: it's little beside my sword and my name. The one is naturally at\nmy wife's service; for the other, I have had some pride in keeping it\nuntarnished. It is now in your keeping as well as my own. I do not fear\nto leave it there, madam.\"\n\nI had spoken with my eyes upon the garden outside the window, but now I\nlooked at her, to see that she was trembling in every limb,--trembling\nso that I thought she would fall. I hastened to her. \"The roses,\" she\nsaid,--\"the roses are too heavy. Oh, I am tired--and the room goes\nround.\"\n\nI caught her as she fell, and laid her gently upon the floor. There\nwas water on the table, and I dashed some in her face and moistened\nher lips; then turned to the door to get woman's help, and ran against\nDiccon.\n\n\"I got that bag of bones here at last, sir,\" he began. \"If ever I\"--His\neyes traveled past me, and he broke off.\n\n\"Don't stand there staring,\" I ordered. \"Go bring the first woman you\nmeet.\"\n\n\"Is she dead?\" he asked under his breath. \"Have you killed her?\"\n\n\"Killed her, fool!\" I cried. \"Have you never seen a woman swoon?\"\n\n\"She looks like death,\" he muttered. \"I thought\"--\n\n\"You thought!\" I exclaimed. \"You have too many thoughts. Begone, and\ncall for help!\"\n\n\"Here is Angela,\" he said sullenly and without offering to move, as,\nlight of foot, soft of voice, ox-eyed and docile, the black woman\nentered the room. When I saw her upon her knees beside the motionless\nfigure, the head pillowed on her arm, her hand busy with the fastenings\nabout throat and bosom, her dark face as womanly tender as any English\nmother's bending over her nursling; and when I saw my wife, with a\nlittle moan, creep further into the encircling arms, I was satisfied.\n\n\"Come away!\" I said, and, followed by Diccon, went out and shut the\ndoor.\n\nMy Lord Carnal was never one to let the grass grow beneath his feet.\nAn hour later came his cartel, borne by no less a personage than the\nSecretary of the colony.\n\nI took it from the point of that worthy's rapier. It ran thus: \"SIR,--At\nwhat hour to-morrow and at what place do you prefer to die? And with\nwhat weapon shall I kill you?\"\n\n\"Captain Percy will give me credit for the profound reluctance with\nwhich I act in this affair against a gentleman and an officer so high\nin the esteem of the colony,\" said Master Pory, with his hand upon his\nheart. \"When I tell him that I once fought at Paris in a duel of six\non the same side with my late Lord Carnal, and that when I was last\nat court my Lord Warwick did me the honor to present me to the present\nlord, he will see that I could not well refuse when the latter requested\nmy aid.\"\n\n\"Master Pory's disinterestedness is perfectly well known,\" I said,\nwithout a smile. \"If he ever chooses the stronger side, sure he has\nstrong reasons for so doing. He will oblige me by telling his principal\nthat I ever thought sunrise a pleasant hour for dying, and that there\ncould be no fitter place than the field behind the church, convenient as\nit is to the graveyard. As for weapons, I have heard that he is a good\nswordsman, but I have some little reputation that way myself. If he\nprefers pistols or daggers, so be it.\"\n\n\"I think we may assume the sword,\" said Master Pory.\n\nI bowed.\n\n\"You'll bring a friend?\" he asked.\n\n\"I do not despair of finding one,\" I answered, \"though my second, Master\nSecretary, will put himself in some jeopardy.\"\n\n\"It is combat... outrance, I believe?\"\n\n\"I understand it so.\"\n\n\"Then we'd better have Bohun. The survivor may need his services.\"\n\n\"As you please,\" I replied, \"though my man Diccon dresses my scratches\nwell enough.\"\n\nHe bit his lip, but could not hide the twinkle in his eye.\n\n\"You are cocksure,\" he said. \"Curiously enough, so is my lord. There\nare no further formalities to adjust, I believe? To-morrow at sunrise,\nbehind the church, and with rapiers?\"\n\n\"Precisely.\"\n\nHe slapped his blade back into its sheath. \"Then that's over and done\nwith, for the nonce at least! Sufficient unto the day, etcetera. 'S\nlife! I'm hot and dry! You've sacked cities, Ralph Percy; now sack me\nthe minister's closet and bring out his sherris I'll be at charges for\nthe next communion.\"\n\nWe sat us down upon the doorstep with a tankard of sack between us, and\nMaster Pory drank, and drank, and drank again.\n\n\"How's the crop?\" he asked. \"Martin reports it poorer in quality than\never, but Sir George will have it that it is very Varinas.\"\n\n\"It's every whit as good as the Spanish,\" I answered. \"You may tell my\nLord Warwick so, when next you write.\"\n\nHe laughed. If he was a timeserver and leagued with my Lord Warwick's\nfaction in the Company, he was a jovial sinner. Traveler and student,\nmuch of a philosopher, more of a wit, and boon companion to any beggar\nwith a pottle of ale,--while the drink lasted,--we might look askance at\nhis dealings, but we liked his company passing well. If he took half a\npoor rustic's crop for his fee, he was ready enough to toss him sixpence\nfor drink money; and if he made the tenants of the lands allotted to\nhis office leave their tobacco uncared for whilst they rowed him on\nhis innumerable roving expeditions up creeks and rivers, he at least\nlightened their labors with most side-splitting tales, and with bottle\nsongs learned in a thousand taverns.\n\n\"After to-morrow there'll be more interesting news to write,\" he\nannounced. \"You're a bold man, Captain Percy.\"\n\nHe looked at me out of the corners of his little twinkling eyes. I sat\nand smoked in silence.\n\n\"The King begins to dote upon him,\" he said; \"leans on his arm, plays\nwith his hand, touches his cheek. Buckingham stands by, biting his lip,\nhis brow like a thundercloud. You'll find in to-morrow's antagonist,\nRalph Percy, as potent a conjurer as your cousin Hotspur found in\nGlendower. He'll conjure you up the Tower, and a hanging, drawing, and\nquartering. Who touches the King's favorite had safer touch the King.\nIt's _lese-majeste_\u00c2\u0082 you contemplate.\"\n\nHe lit his pipe and blew out a great cloud of smoke, then burst into\na roar of laughter. \"My Lord High Admiral may see you through. Zooks!\nthere'll be a raree-show worth the penny, behind the church to-morrow, a\nPercy striving with all his might and main to serve a Villiers! Eureka!\nThere is something new under the sun, despite the Preacher!\" He blew out\nanother cloud of smoke. By this the tankard was empty, and his cheeks\nwere red, his eyes moist, and his laughter very ready.\n\n\"Where's the Lady Jocelyn Leigh?\" he asked. \"May I not have the honor to\nkiss her hand before I go?\"\n\nI stared at him. \"I do not understand you,\" I said coldly. \"There\n's none within but Mistress Percy. She is weary, and rests after her\njourney. We came from Weyanoke this morning.\"\n\nHe shook with laughter. \"Ay, ay, brave it out!\" he cried. \"It's what\nevery man Jack of us said you would do! But all's known, man! The\nGovernor read the King's letters in full Council an hour ago. She's the\nLady Jocelyn Leigh; she 's a ward of the King's; she and her lands are\nto wed my Lord Carnal!\"\n\n\"She was all that,\" I replied. \"Now she 's my wife.\"\n\n\"You'll find that the Court of High Commission will not agree with you.\"\n\nMy rapier lay across my knees, and I ran my hand down its worn scabbard.\n\"Here 's one that agrees with me,\" I said. \"And up there is Another,\"\nand I lifted my hat.\n\nHe stared. \"God and my good sword!\" he cried. \"A very knightly\ndependence, but not to be mentioned nowadays in the same breath with\ngold and the King's favor. Better bend to the storm, man; sing low while\nit roars past. You can swear that you did n't know her to be of finer\nweave than dowlas. Oh, they'll call it in some sort a marriage, for the\nlady's own sake; but they'll find flaws enough to crack a thousand such\nmad matches. The divorce is the thing! There's precedent, you know. A\nfair lady was parted from a brave man not a thousand years ago, because\na favorite wanted her. True, Frances Howard wanted the favorite, whilst\nthis beauty of yours\"--\n\n\"You will please not couple the name of my wife with the name of that\nadulteress!\" I interrupted fiercely.\n\nHe started; then cried out somewhat hurriedly: \"No offense, no offense!\nI meant no comparisons; comparisons are odorous, saith Dogberry. All at\ncourt know the Lady Jocelyn Leigh for a very Britomart, a maid as cold\nas Dian!\"\n\nI rose, and began to pace up and down the bit of green before the door.\n\"Master Pory,\" I said at last, coming to a stop before him, \"if, without\nbreach of faith, you can tell me what was said or done at the Council\nto-day anent this matter, you will lay me under an obligation that I\nshall not forget.\"\n\nHe studied the lace on his sleeve in silence for a while; then glanced\nup at me out of those small, sly, merry eyes. \"Why,\" he answered, \"the\nKing demands that the lady be sent home forthwith, on the ship that gave\nus such a turn to-day, in fact, with a couple of women to attend her,\nand under the protection of the only other passenger of quality, to wit,\nmy Lord Carnal. His Majesty cannot conceive it possible that she hath\nso far forgotten her birth, rank, and duty as to have maintained in\nVirginia this mad masquerade, throwing herself into the arms of any\npetty planter or broken adventurer who hath chanced to have an hundred\nand twenty pounds of filthy tobacco with which to buy him a wife. If she\nhath been so mad, she is to be sent home none the less, where she will\nbe tenderly dealt with as one surely in this sole matter under the spell\nof witchcraft. The ship is to bring home also--and in irons--the man\nwho married her. If he swears to have been ignorant of her quality, and\nplaces no straws in the way of the King's Commissioners, then shall he\nbe sent honorably back to Virginia with enough in his hand to get him\nanother wife. Per contra, if he erred with open eyes, and if he remain\ncontumacious, he will have to deal with the King and with the Court of\nHigh Commission, to say nothing of the King's favorite. That's the sum\nand substance, Ralph Percy.\"\n\n\"Why was my Lord Carnal sent?\" I asked.\n\n\"Probably because my Lord Carnal would come. He hath a will, hath my\nLord, and the King is more indulgent than Eli to those upon whom he\ndotes. Doubtless, my Lord High Admiral sped him on his way, gave him the\nKing's best ship, wished him a favorable wind--to hell.\"\n\n\"I was not ignorant that she was other than she seemed, and I remain\ncontumacious.\"\n\n\"Then,\" he said shamelessly, \"you'll forgive me if in public, at least,\nI forswear your company? You're plague-spotted, Captain Percy, and your\nfriends may wish you well, but they must stay at home and burn juniper\nbefore their own doors.\"\n\n\"I'll forgive you,\" I said, \"when you 've told me what the Governor will\ndo.\"\n\n\"Why, there's the rub,\" he answered. \"Yeardley is the most obstinate man\nof my acquaintance. He who at his first coming, beside a great deal of\nworth in his person, brought only his sword hath grown to be as very a\nSir Oracle among us as ever I saw. It's 'Sir George says this,' and 'Sir\nGeorge says that,' and so there's an end on't. It's all because of that\nleave to cut your own throats in your own way that he brought you last\nyear. Sir George and Sir Edwyn! Zooks! you had better dub them St.\nGeorge and St. Edwyn at once, and be done with it. Well, on this\noccasion Sir George stands up and says roundly, with a good round\noath to boot: 'The King's commands have always come to us through the\nCompany. The Company obeys the King; we obey the Company. His Majesty's\ndemand (with reverence I speak it) is out of all order. Let the Company,\nthrough the treasurer, command us to send Captain Percy home in irons to\nanswer for this passing strange offense, or to return, willy nilly, the\nlady who is now surely his wife, and we will have no choice but to\nobey. Until the Company commands us we will do nothing; nay we can do\nnothing.' And every one of my fellow Councilors (for myself, I was busy\nwith my pens) saith, 'My opinion, Sir George.' The upshot of it all\nis that the Due Return is to sail in two days with our humble\nrepresentation to his Majesty that though we bow to his lightest word as\nthe leaf bows to the zephyr, yet we are, in this sole matter, handfast,\ncompelled by his Majesty's own gracious charter to refer our slightest\nofficial doing to that noble Company which owes its very being to its\nrigid adherence to the terms of said charter. Wherefore, if his Majesty\nwill be graciously pleased to command us as usual through the said\nCompany--and so on. Of course, not a soul in the Council, or in\nJamestown, or in Virginia dreams of a duel behind the church at sunrise\nto-morrow.\" He knocked the ashes from his pipe, and by degrees got his\nfat body up from the doorstep. \"So there's a reprieve for you, Ralph\nPercy, unless you kill or are killed to-morrow morning. In the latter\ncase, the problem's solved; in the former, the best service you can do\nyourself, and maybe the Company, is to walk out of the world of your\nown accord, and that as quickly as possible. Better a cross-roads and a\nstake through a dead heart than a hangman's hands upon a live one.\"\n\n\"One moment,\" I said. \"Doth my Lord Carnal know of this decision of the\nGovernor's?\"\n\n\"Ay, and a fine passion it put him into. Stormed and swore and\nthreatened, and put the Governor's back up finely. It seems that he\nthought to 'bout ship to-morrow, lady and all. He refuseth to go without\nthe lady, and so remaineth in Virginia until he can have his will. Lord!\nbut Buckingham would be a happy man if he were kept here forever and a\nday! My lord knows what he risks, and he's in as black a humor as ever\nyou saw. But I have striven to drop oil on the troubled waters. 'My\nlord,' I told him, 'you have but to posses your soul with patience for a\nfew short weeks, just until the ship the Governor sends can return. Then\nall must needs be as your lordship wishes. In the meantime, you may find\nexistence in these wilds and away from that good company which is the\nsoul of life endurable, and perhaps pleasant. You may have daily sight\nof the lady who is to become your wife, and that should count for\nmuch with so ardent and determined a lover as your lordship hath shown\nyourself to be. You may have the pleasure of contemplating your rival's\ngrave, if you kill him. If he kills you, you will care the less about\nthe date of the Santa Teresa's sailing. The land, too, hath inducements\nto offer to a philosophical and contemplative mind such as one whom his\nMajesty delighteth to honor must needs possess. Beside these crystal\nrivers and among these odoriferous woods, my lord, one escapes much\nexpense, envy, contempt, vanity, and vexation of mind.'\"\n\nThe hoary sinner laughed and laughed. When he had gone away, still in\nhuge enjoyment of his own mirth, I, who had seen small cause for mirth,\nwent slowly indoors. Not a yard from the door, in the shadow of the\nvines that draped the window, stood the woman who was bringing this fate\nupon me.\n\n\"I thought that you were in your own room,\" I said harshly, after a\nmoment of dead silence.\n\n\"I came to the window,\" she replied. \"I listened. I heard all.\" She\nspoke haltingly, through dry lips. Her face was as white as her ruff,\nbut a strange light burned in her eyes, and there was no trembling.\n\"This morning you said that all that you had--your name and your\nsword--were at my service. You may take them both again, sir. I refuse\nthe aid you offer. Swear what you will, tell them what you please, make\nyour peace whilst you may. I will not have your blood upon my soul.\"\n\nThere was yet wine upon the table. I filled a cup and brought it to her.\n\"Drink!\" I commanded.\n\n\"I have much of forbearance, much of courtesy, to thank you for,\" she\nsaid. \"I will remember it when--Do not think that I shall blame you\"--\n\nI held the cup to her lips. \"Drink!\" I repeated. She touched the red\nwine with her lips. I took it from her and put it to my own. \"We drink\nof the same cup,\" I said, with my eyes upon hers, and drained it to the\nbottom. \"I am weary of swords and courts and kings. Let us go into the\ngarden and watch the minister's bees.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X IN WHICH MASTER PORY GAINS TIME TO SOME PURPOSE\n\n\nROLFE coming down by boat from Varina, had reached the town in the dusk\nof that day which had seen the arrival of the Santa Teresa, and I had\ngone to him before I slept that night. Early morning found us together\nagain in the field behind the church. We had not long to wait in the\nchill air and dew-drenched grass. When the red rim of the sun showed\nlike a fire between the trunks of the pines came my Lord Carnal, and\nwith him Master Pory and Dr. Lawrence Bohun.\n\nMy lord and I bowed to each other profoundly. Rolfe with my sword and\nMaster Pory with my lord's stepped aside to measure the blades. Dr.\nBohun, muttering something about the feverishness of the early air,\nwrapped his cloak about him, and huddled in among the roots of a\ngigantic cedar. I stood with my back to the church, and my face to the\nred water between us and the illimitable forest; my lord opposite me,\nsix feet away. He was dressed again splendidly in black and scarlet,\ncolors he much affected, and, with the dark beauty of his face and the\narrogant grace with which he stood there waiting for his sword, made a\npicture worth looking upon.\n\nRolfe and the Secretary came back to us. \"If you kill him, Ralph,\" said\nthe former in a low voice, as he took my doublet from me, \"you are to\nput yourself in my hands and do as you are bid.\"\n\n\"Which means that you will try to smuggle me north to the Dutch. Thanks,\nfriend, but I'll see the play out here.\"\n\n\"You were ever obstinate, self-willed, reckless--and the man most to my\nheart,\" he continued. \"Have your way, in God's name, but I wish not to\nsee what will come of it! All's ready, Master Secretary.\"\n\nVery slowly that worthy stooped down and examined the ground, narrowly\nand quite at his leisure. \"I like it not, Master Rolfe,\" he declared at\nlength. \"Here is a molehill, and there a fairy ring.\"\n\n\"I see neither,\" said Rolfe. \"It looks as smooth as a table. But we can\neasily shift under the cedars where there is no grass.\"\n\n\"Here's a projecting root,\" announced the Secretary, when the new ground\nhad been reached.\n\nRolfe shrugged his shoulders, but we moved again.\n\n\"The light comes jaggedly through the branches,\" objected my lord's\nsecond. \"Better try the open again.\"\n\nRolfe uttered an exclamation of impatience, and my lord stamped his foot\non the ground. \"What is this foolery, sir?\" the latter cried fiercely.\n\"The ground's well enough, and there 's sufficient light to die by.\"\n\n\"Let the light pass, then,\" said his second resignedly. \"Gentlemen,\nare you read--Ods blood! my lord, I had not noticed the roses upon your\nlordship's shoes! They are so large and have such a fall that they\nsweep the ground on either side your foot; you might stumble in all that\ndangling ribbon and lace. Allow me to remove them.\"\n\nHe unsheathed his knife, and, sinking upon his knees, began leisurely to\nsever the threads that held the roses to the leather. As he worked, he\nlooked neither at the roses nor at my lord's angry face, but beneath his\nown bent arm toward the church and the town beyond.\n\nHow long he would have sawed away at the threads there is no telling;\nfor my lord, amongst whose virtues patience was not one, broke from him,\nand with an oath stooped and tore away the offending roses with his\nown hand, then straightened himself and gripped his sword more closely.\n\"I've learned one thing in this d----d land,\" he snarled, \"and that is\nwhere not to choose a second. You, sir,\" to Rolfe, \"give the word.\"\n\nMaster Pory rose from his knees, unruffled and unabashed, and still with\na curiously absent expression upon his fat face and with his ears cocked\nin the direction of the church. \"One moment, gentlemen,\" he said. \"I\nhave just bethought me\"--\n\n\"On guard!\" cried Rolfe, and cut him short.\n\nThe King's favorite was no mean antagonist. Once or twice the thought\ncrossed my mind that here, where I least desired it, I had met my match.\nThe apprehension passed. He fought as he lived, with a fierce intensity,\na headlong passion, a brute force, bearing down and overwhelming most\nobstacles. But that I could tire him out I soon knew.\n\nThe incessant flash and clash of steel, the quick changes in position,\nthe need to bring all powers of body and mind to aid of eye and wrist,\nthe will to win, the shame of loss, the rage and lust of blood,--there\nwas no sight or sound outside that trampled circle that could force\nitself upon our brain or make us glance aside. If there was a sudden\ncommotion amongst the three witnesses, if an expression of immense\nrelief and childlike satisfaction reigned in Master Pory's face, we knew\nit not. We were both bleeding,--I from a pin prick on the shoulder,\nhe from a touch beneath the arm. He made a desperate thrust, which I\nparried, and the blades clashed. A third came down upon them with such\nforce that the sparks flew.\n\n\"In the King's name!\" commanded the Governor.\n\nWe fell apart, panting, white with rage, staring at the unexpected\ndisturbers of our peace. They were the Governor, the commander, the Cape\nMerchant, and the watch.\n\n\"Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace!\" exclaimed Master\nPory, and retired to the cedar and Dr. Bohun.\n\n\"This ends here, gentlemen,\" said the Governor firmly. \"You are both\nbleeding. It is enough.\"\n\n\"Out of my way, sir!\" cried my lord, foaming at the mouth. He made a mad\nthrust over the Governor's extended arm at me, who was ready enough to\nmeet him. \"Have at thee, thou bridegroom!\" he said between his teeth.\n\nThe Governor caught him by the wrist. \"Put up your sword, my lord, or,\nas I stand here, you shall give it into the commander's hands!\"\n\n\"Hell and furies!\" ejaculated my lord. \"Do you know who I am, sir?\"\n\n\"Ay,\" replied the Governor sturdily, \"I do know. It is because of that\nknowledge, my Lord Carnal, that I interfere in this affair. Were you\nother than you are, you and this gentleman might fight until doomsday,\nand meet with no hindrance from me. Being what you are, I will prevent\nany renewal of this duel, by fair means if I may, by foul if I must.\"\n\nHe left my lord, and came over to me. \"Since when have you been upon my\nLord Warwick's side, Ralph Percy?\" he demanded, lowering his voice.\n\n\"I am not so,\" I said.\n\n\"Then appearances are mightily deceitful,\" he retorted.\n\n\"I know what you mean, Sir George,\" I answered. \"I know that if the\nKing's darling should meet death or maiming in this fashion, upon\nVirginian soil, the Company, already so out of favor, might find some\ndifficulty in explaining things to his Majesty's satisfaction. But I\nthink my Lord Southampton and Sir Edwyn Sandys and Sir George Yeardley\nequal to the task, especially if they are able to deliver to his Majesty\nthe man whom his Majesty will doubtless consider the true and only rebel\nand murderer. Let us fight it out, sir. You can all retire to a distance\nand remain in profound ignorance of any such affair. If I fall, you have\nnothing to fear. If he falls,--why, I shall not run away, and the Due\nReturn sails to-morrow.\"\n\nHe eyed me closely from under frowning brows.\n\n\"And when your wife's a widow, what then?\" he asked abruptly.\n\nI have not known many better men than this simple, straightforward,\nsoldierly Governor. The manliness of his character begot trust, invited\nconfidence. Men told him of their hidden troubles almost against their\nwill, and afterward felt neither shame nor fear, knowing the simplicity\nof his thoughts and the reticence of his speech. I looked him in the\neyes, and let him read what I would have shown to no other, and felt no\nshame. \"The Lord may raise her up a helper,\" I said. \"At least she won't\nhave to marry him.\"\n\nHe turned on his heel and moved back to his former station between us\ntwo. \"My Lord Carnal,\" he said, \"and you, Captain Percy, heed what I\nsay; for what I say I will do. You may take your choice: either you will\nsheathe your swords here in my presence, giving me your word of honor\nthat you will not draw them upon each other before his Majesty shall\nhave made known his will in this matter to the Company, and the Company\nshall have transmitted it to me, in token of which truce between you you\nshall touch each other's hands; or you will pass the time between this\nand the return of the ship with the King's and the Company's will in\nstrict confinement,--you, Captain Percy, in gaol, and you, my Lord\nCarnal, in my own poor house, where I will use my best endeavors to\nmake the days pass as pleasantly as possible for your lordship. I have\nspoken, gentlemen.\"\n\nThere was no protest. For my own part, I knew Yeardley too well to\nattempt any; moreover, had I been in his place, his course should have\nbeen mine. For my Lord Carnal,--what black thoughts visited that fierce\nand sullen brain I know not, but there was acquiescence in his face,\nhaughty, dark, and vengeful though it was. Slowly and as with one motion\nwe sheathed our swords, and more slowly still repeated the few words\nafter the Governor. His Honor's countenance shone with relief. \"Take\neach other by the hand, gentlemen, and then let 's all to breakfast at\nmy own house, where there shall be no feud save with good capon pasty\nand jolly good ale.\" In dead silence my lord and I touched each other's\nfinger tips.\n\nThe world was now a flood of sunshine, the mist on the river vanishing,\nthe birds singing, the trees waving in the pleasant morning air.\nFrom the town came the roll of the drum summoning all to the week-day\nservice. The bells too began to ring, sounding sweetly through the clear\nair. The Governor took off his hat. \"Let's all to church, gentlemen,\" he\nsaid gravely. \"Our cheeks are flushed as with a fever and our pulses run\nhigh this morning. There be some among us, perhaps, that have in their\nhearts discontent, anger, and hatred. I know no better place to take\nsuch passions, provided we bring them not forth again.\"\n\nWe went in and sat down. Jeremy Sparrow was in the pulpit. Singly or\nin groups the town folk entered. Down the aisle strode bearded men,\nold soldiers, adventurers, sailors, scarred body and soul; young men\nfollowed, younger sons and younger brothers, prodigals whose portion had\nbeen spent, whose souls now ate of the husks; to the servants' benches\ncame dull laborers, dimly comprehending, groping in the twilight; women\nentered softly and slowly, some with children clinging to their skirts.\nOne came alone and knelt alone, her face shadowed by her mantle. Amongst\nthe servants stood a slave or two, blindly staring, and behind them all\none of that felon crew sent us by the King.\n\nThrough the open windows streamed the summer sunshine, soft and\nfragrant, impartial and unquestioning, caressing alike the uplifted\nface of the minister, the head of the convict, and all between. The\nminister's voice was grave and tender when he read and prayed, but\nin the hymn it rose above the people's like the voice of some mighty\narchangel. That triumphant singing shook the air, and still rang in the\nheart while we said the Creed.\n\nWhen the service was over, the congregation waited for the Governor to\npass out first. At the door he pressed me to go with him and his party\nto his own house, and I gave him thanks, but made excuse to stay away.\nWhen he and the nobleman who was his guest had left the churchyard, and\nthe townspeople too were gone, I and my wife and the minister walked\nhome together through the dewy meadow, with the splendor of the morning\nabout us, and the birds caroling from every tree and thicket.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI IN WHICH I MEET AN ITALIAN DOCTOR\n\n\nTHE summer slipped away, and autumn came, with the purple of the grape\nand the yellowing corn, the nuts within the forest, and the return of\nthe countless wild fowl to the marshes and reedy river banks, and still\nI stayed in Jamestown, and my wife with me, and still the Santa Teresa\nrode at anchor in the river below the fort. If the man whom she brought\nknew that by tarrying in Virginia he risked his ruin with the King, yet,\nwith a courage worthy of a better cause, he tarried.\n\nNow and then ships came in, but they were small, belated craft. The\nmost had left England before the sailing of the Santa Teresa; the rest,\nprivate ventures, trading for clapboard or sassafras, knew nothing of\ncourt affairs. Only the Sea Flower, sailing from London a fortnight\nafter the Santa Teresa, and much delayed by adverse winds, brought a\nletter from the deputy treasurer to Yeardley and the Council. From\nRolfe I learned its contents. It spoke of the stir that was made by the\ndeparture from the realm of the King's favorite. \"None know where he\nhath gone. The King looks dour; 't is hinted that the privy council are\nas much at sea as the rest of the world; my Lord of Buckingham saith\nnothing, but his following--which of late hath somewhat decayed--is so\nincreased that his antechambers cannot hold the throngs that come to\nwait upon him. Some will have it that my Lord Carnal hath fled the\nkingdom to escape the Tower; others, that the King hath sent him on a\nmission to the King of Spain about this detested Spanish match; others,\nthat the gadfly hath stung him and he is gone to America,--to search for\nRaleigh's gold mine, maybe. This last most improbable; but if 't is so,\nand he should touch at Virginia, receive him with all honor. If indeed\nhe is not out of favor, the Company may find in him a powerful friend;\nof powerful enemies, God knows, there is no lack!\"\n\nThus the worthy Master Ferrar. And at the bottom of the letter, among\nother news of city and court, mention was made of the disappearance of a\nward of the King's, the Lady Jocelyn Leigh. Strict search had been made,\nbut the unfortunate lady had not been found. \"'T is whispered that she\nhath killed herself; also, that his Majesty had meant to give her\nin marriage to my Lord Carnal. But that all true love and virtue and\nconstancy have gone from the age, one might conceive that the said\nlord had but fled the court for a while, to indulge his grief in some\nsolitude of hill and stream and shady vale,--the lost lady being right\nworthy of such dole.\"\n\nIn sooth she was, but my lord was not given to such fashion of mourning.\n\nThe summer passed, and I did nothing. What was there I could do? I had\nwritten by the Due Return to Sir Edwyn, and to my cousin, the Earl\nof Northumberland. The King hated Sir Edwyn as he hated tobacco and\nwitchcraft. \"Choose the devil, but not Sir Edwyn Sandys!\" had been his\npassionate words to the Company the year before. A certain fifth of\nNovember had despoiled my Lord of Northumberland of wealth, fame, and\ninfluence. Small hope there was in those two. That the Governor and\nCouncil, remembering old dangers shared, wished me well I did not doubt,\nbut that was all. Yeardley had done all he could do, more than most men\nwould have dared to do, in procuring this delay. There was no further\nhelp in him; nor would I have asked it. Already out of favor with the\nWarwick faction, he had risked enough for me and mine. I could not flee\nwith my wife to the Indians, exposing her, perhaps, to a death by\nfierce tortures; moreover, Opechancanough had of late strangely taken to\nreturning to the settlements those runaway servants and fugitives from\njustice which before we had demanded from him in vain. If even it had\nbeen possible to run the gauntlet of the Indian villages, war parties,\nand hunting bands, what would have been before us but endless forest and\na winter which for us would have had no spring? I could not see her die\nof hunger and cold, or by the teeth of the wolves. I could not do what I\nshould have liked to do,--take, single-handed, that King's ship with\nits sturdy crew and sail with her south and ever southwards, before us\nnothing more formidable than Spanish ships, and beyond them blue waters,\nspice winds, new lands, strange islands of the blest.\n\nThere seemed naught that I could do, naught that she could do. Our Fate\nhad us by the hands, and held us fast. We stood still, and the days came\nand went like dreams.\n\nWhile the Assembly was in session I had my part to act as Burgess from\nmy hundred. Each day I sat with my fellows in the church, facing the\nGovernor in his great velvet chair, the Council on either hand, and\nlistened to the droning of old Twine, the clerk, like the droning of the\nbees without the window; to the chant of the sergeant-at-arms; to long\nand windy discourses from men who planted better than they spoke; to\nremarks by the Secretary, witty, crammed with Latin and traveled talk;\nto the Governor's slow, weighty words. At Weyanoke we had had trouble\nwith the Indians. I was one who loved them not and had fought them\nwell, for which reason the hundred chose me its representative. In the\nAssembly it was my part to urge a greater severity toward those our\nnatural enemies, a greater watchfulness on our part, the need for\npalisades and sentinels, the danger that lay in their acquisition of\nfirearms, which, in defiance of the law, men gave them in exchange for\nworthless Indian commodities. This Indian business was the chief matter\nbefore the Assembly. I spoke when I thought speech was needed, and spoke\nstrongly; for my heart foreboded that which was to come upon us too soon\nand too surely. The Governor listened gravely, nodding his head;\nMaster Pory, too, the Cape Merchant, and West were of my mind; but the\nremainder were besotted by their own conceit, esteeming the very name of\nEnglishman sentinel and palisade enough, or trusting in the smooth\nwords and vows of brotherhood poured forth so plentifully by that red\nApollyon, Opechancanough.\n\nWhen the day's work was done, and we streamed out of the church,--the\nGovernor and Council first, the rest of us in order,--it was to find\nas often as not a red and black figure waiting for us among the graves.\nSometimes it joined itself to the Governor, sometimes to Master Pory;\nsometimes the whole party, save one, went off with it to the guest\nhouse, there to eat, drink, and make merry.\n\nIf Virginia and all that it contained, save only that jewel of which\nit had robbed the court, were out of favor with the King's minion, he\nshowed it not. Perhaps he had accepted the inevitable with a good grace;\nperhaps it was but his mode of biding his time; but he had shifted\ninto that soldierly frankness of speech and manner, that genial,\nhail-fellow-well-met air, behind which most safely hides a villain's\nmind. Two days after that morning behind the church, he had removed\nhimself, his French valets, and his Italian physician from the\nGovernor's house to the newly finished guest house. Here he lived, cock\nof the walk, taking his ease in his inn, elbowing out all guests save\nthose of his own inviting. If, what with his open face and his open\nhand, his dinners and bear-baitings and hunting parties, his tales\nof the court and the wars, his half hints as to the good he might do\nVirginia with the King, extending even to the lightening of the tax upon\nour tobacco and the prohibition of the Spanish import, his known riches\nand power, and the unknown height to which they might attain if his star\nat court were indeed in the ascendant,--if with these things he slowly,\nbut surely, won to his following all save a very few of those I had\nthought my fast friends, it was not a thing marvelous or without\nprecedent. Upon his side was good that might be seen and handled; on\nmine was only a dubious right and a not at all dubious danger. I do not\nthink it plagued me much. The going of those who had it in their heart\nto wish to go left me content, and for those who fawned upon him from\nthe first, or for the rabble multitude who flung up their caps and ran\nat his heels, I cared not a doit. There were still Rolfe and West and\nthe Governor, Jeremy Sparrow and Diccon.\n\nMy lord and I met, perforce, in the street, at the Governor's house,\nin church, on the river, in the saddle. If we met in the presence of\nothers, we spoke the necessary formal words of greeting or leave-taking,\nand he kept his countenance; if none were by, off went the mask. The\nman himself and I looked each other in the eyes and passed on. Once we\nencountered on a late evening among the graves, and I was not alone.\nMistress Percy had been restless, and had gone, despite the minister's\nprotests, to sit upon the river bank. When I returned from the assembly\nand found her gone, I went to fetch her. A storm was rolling slowly up.\nReturning the long way through the churchyard, we came upon him sitting\nbeside a sunken grave, his knees drawn up to meet his chin, his eyes\ngloomily regardful of the dark broad river, the unseen ocean, and\nthe ship that could not return for weeks to come. We passed him in\nsilence,--I with a slight bow, she with a slighter curtsy. An hour\nlater, going down the street in the dusk of the storm, I ran against Dr.\nLawrence Bohun. \"Don't stop me!\" he panted. \"The Italian doctor is away\nin the woods gathering simples, and they found my Lord Carnal in a fit\namong the graves, half an hour agone.\" My lord was bled, and the next\nmorning went hunting.\n\nThe lady whom I had married abode with me in the minister's house, held\nher head high, and looked the world in the face. She seldom went from\nhome, but when she did take the air it was with pomp and circumstance.\nWhen that slender figure and exquisite face, set off by as rich apparel\nas could be bought from a store of finery brought in by the Southampton,\nand attended by a turbaned negress and a serving man who had been to the\nwars, and had escaped the wheel by the skin of his teeth, appeared in\nthe street, small wonder if a greater commotion arose than had been\nsince the days of the Princess Pocahontas and her train of dusky\nbeauties. To this fairer, more imperial dame gold lace doffed its\nhat and made its courtliest bow, and young planters bent to their\nsaddlebows, while the common folk nudged and stared and had their\nsay. The beauty, the grace, the pride, that deigned small response\nto well-meant words,--all that would have been intolerable in plain\nMistress Percy, once a waiting maid, then a piece of merchandise to be\nsold for one hundred and twenty pounds of tobacco, then the wife of a\npoor gentleman, was pardoned readily enough to the Lady Jocelyn Leigh,\nthe ward of the King, the bride to be (so soon as the King's Court\nof High Commission should have snapped in twain an inconvenient and\nill-welded fetter) of the King's minion.\n\nSo she passed like a splendid vision through the street perhaps once a\nweek. On Sundays she went with me to church, and the people looked at\nher instead of at the minister, who rebuked them not, because his eyes\nwere upon the same errand.\n\nThe early autumn passed and the leaves began to turn, and still all\nthings were as they had been, save that the Assembly sat no longer. My\nfellow Burgesses went back to their hundreds, but my house at Weyanoke\nknew me no more. In a tone that was apologetic, but firm, the Governor\nhad told me that he wished my company at Jamestown. I was pleased enough\nto stay, I assured him,--as indeed I was. At Weyanoke, the thunderbolt\nwould fall without warning; at Jamestown, at least I could see, coming\nup the river, the sails of the Due Return or what other ship the Company\nmight send.\n\nThe color of the leaves deepened, and there came a season of a beauty\nsingular and sad, like a smile left upon the face of the dead summer.\nOver all things, near and far, the forest where it met the sky, the\nnearer woods, the great river, and the streams that empty into it,\nthere hung a blue haze, soft and dream-like. The forest became a painted\nforest, with an ever thinning canopy and an ever thickening carpet of\ncrimson and gold; everywhere there was a low rustling underfoot and a\nslow rain of color. It was neither cold nor hot, but very quiet, and the\nbirds went by like shadows,--a listless and forgetful weather, in which\nwe began to look, every hour of every day, for the sail which we knew we\nshould not see for weeks to come.\n\nGood Master Bucke tarried with Master Thorpe at Henricus, recruiting\nhis strength, and Jeremy Sparrow preached in his pulpit, slept in his\nchamber, and worked in his garden. This garden ran down to the green\nbank of the river; and here, sitting idly by the stream, her chin in her\nhand and her dark eyes watching the strong, free sea birds as they came\nand went, I found my wife one evening, as I came from the fort, where\nhad been some martial exercise. Thirty feet away Master Jeremy Sparrow\nworked among the dying flowers, and hummed:--\n\n    \"There is a garden in her face,\n\n     Where roses and white lilies grow.\"\n\nHe and I had agreed that when I must needs be absent he should be within\ncall of her; for I believed my Lord Carnal very capable of intruding\nhimself into her presence. That house and garden, her movements and\nmine, were spied upon by his foreign hirelings, I knew perfectly well.\n\nAs I sat down upon the bank at her feet, she turned to me with a sudden\npassion. \"I am weary of it all!\" she cried. \"I am tired of being pent up\nin this house and garden, and of the watch you keep upon me. And if I go\nabroad, it is worse! I hate all those shameless faces that stare at me\nas if I were in the pillory. I am pilloried before you all, and I find\nthe experience sufficiently bitter. And when I think that that man whom\nI hate, hate, hate, breathes the air that I breathe, it stifles me! If I\ncould fly away like those birds, if I could only be gone from this place\nfor even a day!\"\n\n\"I would beg leave to take you home, to Weyanoke,\" I said after a pause,\n\"but I cannot go and leave the field to him.\"\n\n\"And I cannot go,\" she answered. \"I must watch for that ship and that\nKing's command that my Lord Carnal thinks potent enough to make me his\nwife. King's commands are strong, but a woman's will is stronger. At\nthe last I shall know what to do. But now why may I not take Angela and\ncross that strip of sand and go into the woods on the other side? They\nare so fair and strange,--all red and yellow,--and they look very still\nand peaceful. I could walk in them, or lie down under the trees and\nforget awhile, and they are not at all far away.\" She looked at me\neagerly.\n\n\"You could not go alone,\" I told her. \"There would be danger in that.\nBut to-morrow, if you choose, I and Master Sparrow and Diccon will take\nyou there. A day in the woods is pleasant enough, and will do none of\nus harm. Then you may wander as you please, fill your arms with colored\nleaves, and forget the world. We will watch that no harm comes nigh you,\nbut otherwise you shall not be disturbed.\"\n\nShe broke into delighted laughter. Of all women the most steadfast of\nsoul, her outward moods were as variable as a child's. \"Agreed!\" she\ncried. \"You and the minister and Diccon Demon shall lay your muskets\nacross your knees, and Angela shall witch you into stone with her old,\nmad, heathen charms. And then--and then--I will gather more gold than\nhad King Midas; I will dance with the hamadryads; I will find out Oberon\nand make Titania jealous!\"\n\n\"I do not doubt that you could do so,\" I said, as she sprang to her\nfeet, childishly eager and radiantly beautiful.\n\nI rose to go in with her, for it was supper time, but in a moment\nchanged my mind, and resumed my seat on the bank of turf. \"Do you go\nin,\" I said. \"There's a snake near by, in those bushes below the bank.\nI'll kill the creature, and then I'll come to supper.\"\n\nWhen she was gone, I walked to where, ten feet away, the bank dipped\nto a clump of reeds and willows planted in the mud on the brink of the\nriver. Dropping on my knees I leaned over, and, grasping a man by the\ncollar, lifted him from the slime where he belonged to the bank beside\nme.\n\nIt was my Lord Carnal's Italian doctor that I had so fished up. I had\nseen him before, and had found in his very small, mean figure clad all\nin black, and his narrow face with malignant eyes, and thin white lips\ndrawn tightly over gleaming teeth, something infinitely repulsive,\nsickening to the sight as are certain reptiles to the touch.\n\n\"There are no simples or herbs of grace to be found amongst reeds and\nhalf-drowned willows,\" I said. \"What did so learned a doctor look for in\nso unlikely a place?\"\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders and made play with his clawlike hands, as if\nhe understood me not. It was a lie, for I knew that he and the English\ntongue were sufficiently acquainted. I told him as much, and he shot\nat me a most venomous glance, but continued to shrug, gesticulate, and\njabber in Italian. At last I saw nothing better to do than to take him,\nstill by the collar, to the edge of the garden next the churchyard, and\nwith the toe of my boot to send him tumbling among the graves. I watched\nhim pick himself up, set his attire to rights, and go away in the\ngathering dusk, winding in and out among the graves; and then I went in\nto supper, and told Mistress Percy that the snake was dead.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII IN WHICH I RECEIVE A WARNING AND REPOSE A TRUST\n\n\nSHORTLY before daybreak I was wakened by a voice beneath my window.\n\"Captain Percy,\" it cried, \"the Governor wishes you at his house!\" and\nwas gone.\n\nI dressed and left the house, disturbing no one. Hurrying through the\nchill dawn, I reached the square not much behind the rapid footsteps\nof the watch who had wakened me. About the Governor's door were horses,\nsaddled and bridled, with grooms at their heads, men and beasts gray and\nindistinct, wrapped in the fog. I went up the steps and into the hall,\nand knocked at the door of the Governor's great room. It opened, and I\nentered to find Sir George, with Master Pory, Rolfe, West, and others of\nthe Council gathered about the great centre table and talking eagerly.\nThe Governor was but half dressed; West and Rolfe were in jack boots and\ncoats of mail. A man, breathless with hard riding, spattered with swamp\nmud and torn by briers, stood, cap in hand, staring from one to the\nother.\n\n\"In good time, Captain Percy!\" cried the Governor. \"Yesterday you called\nthe profound peace with the Indians, of which some of us boasted, the\nlull before the storm. Faith, it looks to-day as though you were in the\nright, after all!\"\n\n\"What 's the matter, sir?\" I asked, advancing to the table.\n\n\"Matter enough!\" he answered. \"This man has come, post haste, from the\nplantations above Paspahegh. Three days ago, Morgan, the trader, was\ndecoyed into the woods by that Paspahegh fool and bully, Nemattanow,\nwhom they call Jack of the Feather, and there murdered. Yesterday, out\nof sheer bravado, the Indian turned up at Morgan's house, and Morgan's\nmen shot him down. They buried the dog, and thought no more of it. Three\nhours ago, Chanco the Christian went to the commander and warned him\nthat the Paspaheghs were in a ferment, and that the warriors were\npainting themselves black. The commander sent off at once to me, and I\nsee naught better to do than to dispatch you with a dozen men to bring\nthem to their senses. But there 's to be no harrying nor battle. A show\nof force is all that 's needed,--I'll stake my head upon it. Let them\nsee that we are not to be taken unawares, but give them fair words. That\nthey may be the sooner placated I send with you Master Rolfe,--they'll\nlisten to him. See that the black paint is covered with red, give them\nsome beads and a knife or two, then come home. If you like not the\nlook of things, find out where Opechancanough is, and I'll send him an\nembassy. He loves us well, and will put down any disaffection.\"\n\n\"There's no doubt that he loves us,\" I said dryly. \"He loves us as a\ncat loves the mouse that it plays with. If we are to start at once, sir,\nI'll go get my horse.\"\n\n\"Then meet us at the neck of land,\" said Rolfe.\n\nI nodded, and left the room. As I descended the steps into the growing\nlight outside, I found Master Pory at my side.\n\n\"I kept late hours last night,\" he remarked, with a portentous yawn.\n\"Now that this business is settled, I'll go back to bed.\"\n\nI walked on in silence.\n\n\"I am in your black books,\" he continued, with his sly, merry, sidelong\nglance. \"You think that I was overcareful of the ground, that morning\nbehind the church, and so unfortunately delayed matters until the\nGovernor happened by and brought things to another guess conclusion.\"\n\n\"I think that you warned the Governor,\" I said bluntly.\n\nHe shook with laughter. \"Warned him? Of course I warned him. Youth would\nnever have seen that molehill and fairy ring and projecting root, but\nwisdom cometh with gray hairs, my son. D' ye not think I'll have the\nKing's thanks?\"\n\n\"Doubtless,\" I answered. \"An the price contents you, I do not know why I\nshould quarrel with it.\"\n\nBy this we were halfway down the street, and we now came upon the guest\nhouse. A window above us was unshuttered, and in the room within a light\nstill burned. Suddenly it was extinguished. A man's face looked down\nupon us for a moment, then drew back; a skeleton hand was put out softly\nand slowly, and the shutter drawn to. Hand and face belonged to the man\nI had sent tumbling among the graves the evening before.\n\n\"The Italian doctor,\" said Master Pory.\n\nThere was something peculiar in his tone. I glanced at him, but his\nbroad red face and twinkling eyes told me nothing. \"The Italian doctor,\"\nhe repeated. \"If I had a friend in Captain Percy's predicament, I should\nbid him beware of the Italian doctor.\"\n\n\"Your friend would be obliged for the warning,\" I replied.\n\nWe walked a little further. \"And I think,\" he said, \"that I should\ninform this purely hypothetical friend of mine that the Italian and his\npatron had their heads mighty close together, last night.\"\n\n\"Last night?\"\n\n\"Ay, last night. I went to drink with my lord, and so broke up their\ntete-a-tete. My lord was boisterous in his cups and not oversecret.\nHe dropped some hints\"--He broke off to indulge in one of his endless\nsilent laughs. \"I don't know why I tell you this, Captain Percy. I am\non the other side, you know,--quite on the other side. But now I bethink\nme, I am only telling you what I should tell you were I upon your side.\nThere's no harm in that, I hope, no disloyalty to my Lord Carnal's\ninterests which happen to be my interests?\"\n\nI made no answer. I gave him credit both for his ignorance of the very\nhornbook of honor and for his large share of the milk of human kindness.\n\n\"My lord grows restive,\" he said, when we had gone a little further.\n\"The Francis and John, coming in yesterday, brought court news. Out of\nsight, out of mind. Buckingham is making hay while the sun shines. Useth\nangel water for his complexion, sleepeth in a medicated mask such as the\nValois used, and is grown handsomer than ever; changeth the fashion of\nhis clothes thrice a week, which mightily pleaseth his Majesty. Whoops\non the Spanish match, too, and, wonderful past all whooping, from the\nprince's detestation hath become his bosom friend. Small wonder if my\nLord Carnal thinks it's time he was back at Whitehall.\"\n\n\"Let him go, then,\" I said. \"There's his ship that brought him here.\"\n\n\"Ay, there 's his ship,\" rejoined Master Pory. \"A few weeks more, and\nthe Due Return will be here with the Company's commands. D' ye think,\nCaptain Percy, that there's the slightest doubt as to their tenor?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then my lord has but to possess his soul with patience and wait for the\nDue Return. No doubt he'll do so.\"\n\n\"No doubt he'll do so,\" I echoed.\n\nBy this we had reached the Secretary's own door. \"Fortune favor you with\nthe Paspaheghs!\" he said, with another mighty yawn. \"As for me, I'll\nto bed. Do you ever dream, Captain Percy? I don't; mine is too good a\nconscience. But if I did, I should dream of an Italian doctor.\"\n\nThe door shut upon his red face and bright eyes. I walked rapidly on\ndown the street to the minister's house. The light was very pale as yet,\nand house and garden lay beneath a veil of mist. No one was stirring. I\nwent on through the gray wet paths to the stable, and roused Diccon.\n\n\"Saddle Black Lamoral quickly,\" I ordered. \"There's trouble with the\nPaspaheghs, and I am off with Master Rolfe to settle it.\"\n\n\"Am I to go with you?\" he asked.\n\nI shook my head. \"We have a dozen men. There's no need of more.\"\n\nI left him busy with the horse, and went to the house. In the hall I\nfound the negress strewing the floor with fresh rushes, and asked her\nif her mistress yet slept. In her soft half English, half Spanish, she\nanswered in the affirmative. I went to my own room and armed myself;\nthen ran upstairs to the comfortable chamber where abode Master Jeremy\nSparrow, surrounded by luxuries which his soul contemned. He was not\nthere. At the foot of the stair I was met by Goodwife Allen. \"The\nminister was called an hour ago, sir,\" she announced. \"There's a man\ndying of the fever at Archer's Hope, and they sent a boat for him. He\nwon't be back until afternoon.\"\n\nI hurried past her back to the stable. Black Lamoral was saddled, and\nDiccon held the stirrup for me to mount.\n\n\"Good luck with the vermin, sir!\" he said. \"I wish I were going, too.\"\n\nHis tone was sullen, yet wistful. I knew that he loved danger as I\nloved it, and a sudden remembrance of the dangers we had faced together\nbrought us nearer to each other than we had been for many a day.\n\n\"I don't take you,\" I explained, \"because I have need of you here.\nMaster Sparrow has gone to watch beside a dying man, and will not be\nback for hours. As for myself, there's no telling how long I may be\nkept. Until I come you are to guard house and garden well. You know what\nI mean. Your mistress is to be molested by no one.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir.\"\n\n\"One thing more. There was some talk yesterday of my taking her across\nthe neck to the forest. When she awakes, tell her from me that I am\nsorry for her to lose her pleasure, but that now she could not go even\nwere I here to take her.\"\n\n\"There 's no danger from the Paspaheghs there,\" he muttered.\n\n\"The Paspaheghs happen not to be my only foes,\" I said curtly. \"Do as I\nbid you without remark. Tell her that I have good reasons for desiring\nher to remain within doors until my return. On no account whatever is\nshe to venture without the garden.\"\n\nI gathered up the reins, and he stood back from the horse's head. When\nI had gone a few paces I drew rein, and, turning in my saddle, spoke to\nhim across the dew-drenched grass. \"This is a trust, Diccon,\" I said.\n\nThe red came into his tanned face. He raised his hand and made our old\nmilitary salute. \"I understand it so, my captain,\" he answered, and I\nrode away satisfied.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII IN WHICH THE SANTA TERESA DROPS DOWNSTREAM\n\n\nAN hour's ride brought us to the block house standing within the forest,\nmidway between the white plantations at Paspahegh and the village of the\ntribe. We found it well garrisoned, spies out, and the men inclined to\nmake light of the black paint and the seething village.\n\nAmongst them was Chanco the Christian. I called him to me, and we\nlistened to his report with growing perturbation. \"Thirty warriors!\"\nI said, when he had finished. \"And they are painted yellow as well as\nblack, and have dashed their cheeks with puccoon: it's _l'outrance_,\nthen! And the war dance is toward! If we are to pacify this hornets'\nnest, it's high time we set about it. Gentlemen of the block house, we\nare but twelve, and they may beat us back, in which case those that are\nleft of us will fight it out with you here. Watch for us, therefore, and\nhave a sally party ready. Forward, men!\"\n\n\"One moment, Captain Percy,\" said Rolfe. \"Chanco, where's the Emperor?\"\n\n\"Five suns ago he was with the priests at Uttamussac,\" answered the\nIndian. \"Yesterday, at the full sun power, he was in the lodge of\nthe werowance of the Chickahominies. He feasts there still. The\nChickahominies and the Powhatans have buried the hatchet.\"\n\n\"I regret to hear it,\" I remarked. \"Whilst they took each other's\nscalps, mine own felt the safer.\"\n\n\"I advise going direct to Opechancanough,\" said Rolfe.\n\n\"Since he's only a league away, so do I,\" I answered.\n\nWe left the block house and the clearing around it, and plunged into\nthe depths of the forest. In these virgin woods the trees are set well\napart, though linked one to the other by the omnipresent grape, and\nthere is little undergrowth, so that we were able to make good speed.\nRolfe and I rode well in front of our men. By now the sun was shining\nthrough the lower branches of the trees, and the mist was fast\nvanishing. The forest--around us, above us, and under the hoofs of the\nhorses where the fallen leaves lay thick--was as yellow as gold and as\nred as blood.\n\n\"Rolfe,\" I asked, breaking a long silence, \"do you credit what the\nIndians say of Opechancanough?\"\n\n\"That he was brother to Powhatan only by adoption?\"\n\n\"That, fleeing for his life, he came to Virginia, years and years ago,\nfrom some mysterious land far to the south and west?\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" he replied thoughtfully. \"He is like, and yet not like,\nthe people whom he rules. In his eye there is the authority of mind; his\nfeatures are of a nobler cast \"--\n\n\"And his heart is of a darker,\" I said. \"It is a strange and subtle\nsavage.\"\n\n\"Strange enough and subtle enough, I admit,\" he answered, \"though I\nbelieve not with you that his friendliness toward us is but a mask.\"\n\n\"Believe it or not, it is so,\" I said. \"That dark, cold, still face is\na mask, and that simple-seeming amazement at horses and armor, guns and\nblue beads, is a mask. It is in my mind that some fair day the mask will\nbe dropped. Here's the village.\"\n\nUntil our interview with Chanco the Christian, the village of the\nPaspaheghs, and not the village of the Chickahominies, had been our\ndestination, and since leaving the block house we had made good speed;\nbut now, within the usual girdle of mulberries, we were met by the\nwerowance and his chief men with the customary savage ceremonies. We had\nlong since come to the conclusion that the birds of the air and the fish\nof the streams were Mercuries to the Indians.\n\nThe werowance received us in due form, with presents of fish and\nvenison, cakes of chinquapin meal and gourds of pohickory, an uncouth\ndance by twelve of his young men and a deal of hellish noise; then, at\nour command, led us into the village, and to the lodge which marked its\ncentre. Around it were gathered Opechancanough's own warriors, men from\nOrapax and Uttamussac and Werowocomoco, chosen for their strength and\ncunning; while upon the grass beneath a blood-red gum tree sat his\nwives, painted and tattooed, with great strings of pearl and copper\nabout their necks. Beyond them were the women and children of the\nChickahominies, and around us all the red forest.\n\nThe mat that hung before the door of the lodge was lifted, and an\nIndian, emerging, came forward, with a gesture of welcome. It was\nNantauquas, the Lady Rebekah's brother, and the one Indian--saving\nalways his dead sister--that was ever to my liking; a savage, indeed,\nbut a savage as brave and chivalrous, as courteous and truthful, as a\nChristian knight.\n\nRolfe sprang from his horse, and advancing to meet the young chief\nembraced him. Nantauquas had been much with his sister during those her\nhappy days at Varina, before she went with Rolfe that ill-fated voyage\nto England, and Rolfe loved him for her sake and for his own. \"I thought\nyou at Orapax, Nantauquas!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"I was there, my brother,\" said the Indian, and his voice was sweet,\ndeep, and grave, like that of his sister. \"But Opechancanough would go\nto Uttamussac, to the temple and the dead kings. I lead his war parties\nnow, and I came with him. Opechancanough is within the lodge. He asks\nthat my brother and Captain Percy come to him there.\"\n\nHe lifted the mat for us, and followed us into the lodge. There was the\nusual winding entrance, with half a dozen mats to be lifted one after\nthe other, but at last we came to the central chamber and to the man we\nsought.\n\nHe sat beside a small fire burning redly in the twilight of the room.\nThe light shone now upon the feathers in his scalp lock, now upon the\ntriple row of pearls around his neck, now upon knife and tomahawk in his\nsilk grass belt, now on the otterskin mantle hanging from his shoulder\nand drawn across his knees. How old he was no man knew. Men said that he\nwas older than Powhatan, and Powhatan was very old when he died. But\nhe looked a man in the prime of life; his frame was vigorous, his skin\nunwrinkled, his eyes bright and full. When he rose to welcome us, and\nNantauquas stood beside him, there seemed not a score of years between\nthem.\n\nThe matter upon which we had come was not one that brooked delay. We\nwaited with what patience we might until his long speech of welcome was\nfinished, when, in as few words as possible, Rolfe laid before him our\ncomplaint against the Paspaheghs. The Indian listened; then said, in\nthat voice that always made me think of some cold, still, bottomless\npool lying black beneath overhanging rocks: \"My brothers may go in\npeace. The Paspaheghs have washed off the black paint. If my brothers go\nto the village, they will find the peace pipe ready for their smoking.\"\n\nRolfe and I stared at each other. \"I have sent messengers,\" continued\nthe Emperor. \"I have told the Paspaheghs of my love for the white man,\nand of the goodwill the white man bears the Indian. I have told them\nthat Nemattanow was a murderer, and that his death was just. They are\nsatisfied. Their village is as still as this beast at my feet.\" He\npointed downward to a tame panther crouched against his moccasins. I\nthought it an ominous comparison.\n\nInvoluntarily we looked at Nantauquas. \"It is true,\" he said. \"I am\nbut come from the village of the Paspaheghs. I took them the word of\nOpechancanough.\"\n\n\"Then, since the matter is settled, we may go home,\" I remarked, rising\nas I spoke. \"We could, of course, have put down the Paspaheghs with one\nhand, giving them besides a lesson which they would not soon forget, but\nin the kindness of our hearts toward them and to save ourselves trouble\nwe came to Opechancanough. For his aid in this trifling business the\nGovernor gives him thanks.\"\n\nA smile just lit the features of the Indian. It was gone in a moment.\n\"Does not Opechancanough love the white men?\" he said. \"Some day he will\ndo more than this for them.\"\n\nWe left the lodge and the dark Emperor within it, got to horse, and\nquitted the village, with its painted people, yellowing mulberries, and\nblood-red gum trees. Nantauquas went with us, keeping pace with Rolfe's\nhorse, and giving us now and then, in his deep musical voice, this or\nthat bit of woodland news. At the block house we found confirmation of\nthe Emperor's statement. An embassy from the Paspaheghs had come with\npresents, and the peace pipe had been smoked. The spies, too, brought\nnews that all war-like preparations had ceased in the village. It\nhad sunk once more into a quietude befitting the sleepy, dreamy, hazy\nweather.\n\nRolfe and I held a short consultation. All appeared safe, but there was\nthe possibility of a ruse. At the last it seemed best that he, who\nby virtue of his peculiar relations with the Indians was ever our\nnegotiator, should remain with half our troop at the block house, while\nI reported to the Governor. So I left him, and Nantauquas with him, and\nrode back to Jamestown, reaching the town some hours sooner than I was\nexpected.\n\nIt was after nooning when I passed through the gates of the palisade,\nand an hour later when I finished my report to the Governor. When he at\nlast dismissed me, I rode quickly down the street toward the minister's\nhouse. As I passed the guest house, I glanced up at the window from\nwhich, at daybreak, the Italian had looked down upon me. No one looked\nout now; the window was closely shuttered, and at the door beneath my\nlord's French rascals were conspicuously absent. A few yards further on\nI met my lord face to face, as he emerged from a lane that led down to\nthe river. At sight of me he started violently, and his hand went to his\nmouth. I slightly bent my head, and rode on past him. At the gate of the\nchurchyard, a stone's throw from home, I met Master Jeremy Sparrow.\n\n\"Well met!\" he exclaimed. \"Are the Indians quiet?\"\n\n\"For the nonce. How is your sick man?\"\n\n\"Very well,\" he answered gravely. \"I closed his eyes two hours ago.\"\n\n\"He's dead, then,\" I said. \"Well, he 's out of his troubles, and hath\nthat advantage over the living. Have you another call, that you travel\nfrom home so fast?\"\n\n\"Why, to tell the truth,\" he replied, \"I could not but feel uneasy when\nI learned just now of this commotion amongst the heathen. You must know\nbest, but I should not have thought it a day for madam to walk in the\nwoods; so I e'en thought I would cross the neck and bring her home.\"\n\n\"For madam to walk in the woods?\" I said slowly. \"So she walks there?\nWith whom?\"\n\n\"With Diccon and Angela,\" he answered. \"They went before the sun was\nan hour high, so Goodwife Allen says. I thought that you--\" \"No,\" I\ntold him. \"On the contrary, I left command that she should not venture\noutside the garden. There are more than Indians abroad.\"\n\nI was white with anger; but besides anger there was fear in my heart.\n\n\"I will go at once and bring her home,\" I said. As I spoke, I happened\nto glance toward the fort and the shipping in the river beyond.\nSomething seemed wrong with the prospect. I looked again, and saw what\nhated and familiar object was missing.\n\n\"Where is the Santa Teresa?\" I demanded, the fear at my heart tugging\nharder.\n\n\"She dropped downstream this morning. I passed her as I came up from\nArcher's Hope, awhile ago. She's anchored in midstream off the big\nspring. Why did she go?\"\n\nWe looked each other in the eyes, and each read the thought that neither\ncared to put into words.\n\n\"You can take the brown mare,\" I said, speaking lightly because my heart\nwas as heavy as lead, \"and we'll ride to the forest. It is all right, I\ndare say. Doubtless we'll find her garlanding herself with the grape, or\nplaying with the squirrels, or asleep on the red leaves, with her head\nin Angela's lap.\"\n\n\"Doubtless,\" he said. \"Don't lose time. I'll saddle the mare and\novertake you in two minutes.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV IN WHICH WE SEEK A LOST LADY\n\n\nBESIDE the minister and myself, nothing human moved in the crimson\nwoods. Blue haze was there, and the steady drift of colored leaves, and\nthe sunshine freely falling through bared limbs, but no man or woman.\nThe fallen leaves rustled as the deer passed, the squirrels chattered\nand the foxes barked, but we heard no sweet laughter or ringing song.\n\nWe found a bank of moss, and lying upon it a chaplet of red-brown oak\nleaves; further on, the mint beside a crystal streamlet had been trodden\nunderfoot; then, flung down upon the brown earth beneath some pines, we\ncame upon a long trailer of scarlet vine. Beyond was a fairy hollow, a\ncuplike depression, curtained from the world by the red vines that hung\nfrom the trees upon its brim, and carpeted with the gold of a great\nmaple; and here Fear became a giant with whom it was vain to wrestle.\n\nThere had been a struggle in the hollow. The curtain of vines was\ntorn, the boughs of a sumach bent and broken, the fallen leaves groun\nunderfoot. In one place there was blood upon the leaves.\n\nThe forest seemed suddenly very quiet,--quite soundless save for the\nbeating of our hearts. On every side opened red and yellow ways, sunny\nglades, labyrinthine paths, long aisles, all dim with the blue haze like\nthe cloudy incense in stone cathedrals, but nothing moved in them save\nthe creatures of the forest. Without the hollow there was no sign. The\nleaves looked undisturbed, or others, drifting down, had hidden any\nmarks there might have been; no footprints, no broken branches, no token\nof those who had left the hollow. Down which of the painted ways had\nthey gone, and where were they now?\n\nSparrow and I sat our horses, and stared now down this alley, now down\nthat, into the blue that closed each vista.\n\n\"The Santa Teresa is just off the big spring,\" he said at last. \"She\nmust have dropped down there in order to take in water quietly.\"\n\n\"The man that came upon her is still in town,--or was an hour agone,\" I\nreplied.\n\n\"Then she has n't sailed yet,\" he said.\n\nIn the distance something grew out of the blue mist. I had not lived\nthirteen years in the woodland to be dim of sight or dull of hearing.\n\n\"Some one is coming,\" I announced. \"Back your horse into this clump of\nsumach.\"\n\nThe sumach grew thick, and was draped, moreover, with some broad-leafed\nvine. Within its covert we could see with small danger of being seen,\nunless the approaching figure should prove to be that of an Indian. It\nwas not an Indian; it was my Lord Carnal. He came on slowly, glancing\nfrom side to side, and pausing now and then as if to listen. He was so\nlittle of a woodsman that he never looked underfoot.\n\nSparrow touched my arm and pointed down a glade at right angles with\nthe path my lord was pursuing. Up this glade there was coming toward\nus another figure,--a small black figure that moved swiftly, looking\nneither to the right nor to the left.\n\nBlack Lamoral stood like a stone; the brown mare, too, had learned what\nmeant a certain touch upon her shoulder. Sparrow and I, with small\nshame for our eavesdropping, bent to our saddlebows and looked sideways\nthrough tiny gaps in the crimson foliage.\n\nMy lord descended one side of the hollow, his heavy foot bringing down\nthe dead leaves and loose earth; the Italian glided down the opposite\nside, disturbing the economy of the forest as little as a snake would\nhave done.\n\n\"I thought I should never meet you,\" growled my lord. \"I thought I had\nlost you and her and myself. This d-d red forest and this blue haze are\nenough to\"--He broke off with an oath.\n\n\"I came as fast as I could,\" said the other. His voice was strange, thin\nand dreamy, matching his filmy eyes and his eternal, very faint smile.\n\"Your poor physician congratulates your lordship upon the success that\nstill attends you. Yours is a fortunate star, my lord.\"\n\n\"Then you have her safe?\" cried my lord.\n\n\"Three miles from here, on the river bank, is a ring of pines, in which\nthe trees grow so thick that it is always twilight. Ten years ago a man\nwas murdered there, and Sir Thomas Dale chained the murderer to the tree\nbeneath which his victim was buried, and left him to perish of hunger\nand thirst. That is the tale they tell at Jamestown. The wood is said\nto be haunted by murdered and murderer, and no one enters it or comes\nnearer to it than he can avoid: which makes it an excellent resort for\nthose whom the dead cannot scare. The lady is there, my lord, with your\nfour knaves to guard her. They do not know that the gloom and quiet of\nthe place are due to more than nature.\"\n\nMy lord began to laugh. Either he had been drinking, or the success of\nhis villainy had served for wine. \"You are a man in a thousand, Nicolo!\"\nhe said. \"How far above or below the ship is this fortunate wood?\"\n\n\"Just opposite, my lord.\"\n\n\"Can a boat land easily?\"\n\n\"A creek runs through the wood to the river. There needs but the\nappointed signal from the bank, and a boat from the Santa Teresa can be\nrowed up the stream to the very tree beneath which the lady sits.\"\n\nMy lord's laughter rang out again. \"You're a man in ten thousand,\nNicolo! Nicolo, the bridegroom's in town.\"\n\n\"Back so soon?\" said the Italian. \"Then we must change your lordship's\nplan. With him on the ground, you can no longer wait until nightfall to\nrow downstream to the lady and the Santa Teresa. He'll come to look for\nher.\"\n\n\"Ay he'll come to look for her, curse him!\" echoed my lord.\n\n\"Do you think the dead will scare him?\" continued the Italian.\n\n\"No, I don't!\" answered my lord, with an oath. \"I would he were among\nthem! An I could have killed him before I went\"--\n\n\"I had devised a way to do it long ago, had not your lordship's\nconscience been so tender. And yet, before now, our enemies--yours and\nmine, my lord--have met with sudden and mysterious death. Men stared,\nbut they ended by calling it a dispensation of Providence.\" He broke\noff to laugh with silent, hateful laughter, as mirthful as the grin of a\ndeath's-head.\n\n\"I know, I know!\" said my lord impatiently. \"We are not overnice,\nNicolo. But between me and those who then stood in my way there had\npassed no challenge. This is my mortal foe, through whose heart I would\ndrive my sword. I would give my ruby to know whether he's in the town or\nin the forest.\"\n\n\"He's in the forest,\" I said.\n\nBlack Lamoral and the brown mare were beside them before either moved\nhand or foot, or did aught but stare and stare, as though men and horses\nhad risen from the dead. All the color was gone from my lord's face,--it\nlooked white, drawn, and pinched; as for his companion, his countenance\ndid not change,--never changed, I believe,--but the trembling of the\nfeather in his hat was not caused by the wind.\n\nJeremy Sparrow bent down from his saddle, seized the Italian under the\narmpits, and swung him clean from the ground up to the brown mare's\nneck. \"Divinity and medicine,\" he said genially, \"soul healer and body\npoisoner, we'll ride double for a time,\" and proceeded to bind the\ndoctor's hands with his own scarf. The creature of venom before him\nwrithed and struggled, but the minister's strength was as the strength\nof ten, and the minister's hand held him down. By this I was off Black\nLamoral and facing my lord. The color had come back to his lip and\ncheek, and the flash to his eye. His hand went to his sword hilt.\n\n\"I shall not draw mine, my lord,\" I told him. \"I keep troth.\"\n\nHe stared at me with a frown that suddenly changed into a laugh, forced\nand unnatural enough. \"Then go thy ways, and let me go mine!\" he cried.\n\"Be complaisant, worthy captain of trainbands and Burgess from a dozen\nhuts! The King and I will make it worth your while.\"\n\n\"I will not draw my sword upon you,\" I replied, \"but I will try a fall\nwith you,\" and I seized him by the wrist.\n\nHe was a good wrestler as he was a good swordsman, but, with bitter\nanger in my heart and a vision of the haunted wood before my eyes, I\nthink I could have wrestled with Hercules and won. Presently I threw\nhim, and, pinning him down with my knee upon his breast, cried to\nSparrow to cut the bridle reins from Black Lamoral and throw them to me.\nThough he had the Italian upon his hands, he managed to obey. With my\nfree hand and my teeth I drew a thong about my lord's arms and bound\nthem to his sides; then took my knee from his chest and my hand from his\nthroat, and rose to my feet. He rose too with one spring. He was very\nwhite, and there was foam on his lips.\n\n\"What next, captain?\" he demanded thickly. \"Your score is mounting up\nrather rapidly. What next?\"\n\n\"This,\" I replied, and with the other thong fastened him, despite his\nstruggles, to the young maple beneath which we had wrestled. When the\ntask was done, I first drew his sword from its jeweled scabbard and laid\nit on the ground at his feet, and then cut the leather which restrained\nhis arms, leaving him only tied to the tree. \"I am not Sir Thomas Dale,\"\nI said, \"and therefore I shall not gag you and leave you bound for an\nindefinite length of time, to contemplate a grave that you thought\nto dig. One haunted wood is enough for one county. Your lordship will\nobserve that I have knotted your bonds in easy reach of your hands, the\nuse of which I have just restored to you. The knot is a peculiar one;\nan Indian taught it to me. If you set to work at once, you will get it\nuntied before nightfall. That you may not think it the Gordian knot and\ntreat it as such, I have put your sword where you can get it only when\nyou have worked for it. Your familiar, my lord, may prove of use to us;\ntherefore we will take him with us to the haunted wood. I have the honor\nto wish your lordship a very good day.\"\n\nI bowed low, swung myself into my saddle, and turned my back upon\nhis glaring eyes and bared teeth. Sparrow, his prize flung across his\nsaddlebow, turned with me. A minute more saw us out of the hollow, and\nentered upon the glade up which had come the Italian. When we had gone\na short distance, I turned in my saddle and looked back. The tiny hollow\nhad vanished; all the forest looked level, dreamy and still, barren of\nhumanity, given over to its own shy children, nothing moving save the\nslow-falling leaves. But from beyond a great clump of sumach, set like\na torch in the vaporous blue, came a steady stream of words, happily\nrendered indistinguishable by distance, and I knew that the King's\nminion was cursing the Italian, the Governor, the Santa Teresa, the Due\nReturn, the minister, the forest, the haunted wood, his sword, the knot\nthat I had tied, and myself.\n\nI admit that the sound was music in mine ears.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV IN WHICH WE FIND THE HAUNTED WOOD\n\n\nON the outskirts of the haunted wood we dismounted, fastening the horses\nto two pines. The Italian we gagged and bound across the brown mare's\nsaddle. Then, as noiselessly as Indians, we entered the wood.\n\nOnce within it, it was as though the sun had suddenly sunk from the\nheavens. The pines, of magnificent height and girth, were so closely\nset that far overhead, where the branches began, was a heavy roof of\nfoliage, impervious to the sunshine, brooding, dark and sullen as\na thundercloud, over the cavernous world beneath. There was no\nundergrowth, no clinging vines, no bloom, no color; only the dark,\ninnumerable tree trunks and the purplish-brown, scented, and slippery\nearth. The air was heavy, cold, and still, like cave air; the silence as\nblank and awful as the silence beneath the earth.\n\nThe minister and I stole through the dusk, and for a long time heard\nnothing but our own breathing and the beating of our hearts. But coming\nto a sluggish stream, as quiet as the wood through which it crept,\nand following its slow windings, we at last heard a voice, and in the\ndistance made out dark forms sitting on the earth beside that sombre\nwater. We went on with caution, gliding from tree to tree and making\nno noise. In the cheerless silence of that place any sound would have\nshattered the stillness like a pistol shot.\n\nPresently we came to a halt, and, ourselves hidden by a giant trunk,\nlooked out on stealers and stolen. They were gathered on the bank of\nthe stream, waiting for the boat from the Santa Teresa. The lady whom we\nsought lay like a fallen flower on the dark ground beneath a pine. She\ndid not move, and her eyes were shut. At her head crouched the negress,\nher white garments showing ghostlike through the gloom. Beneath the\nnext tree sat Diccon, his hands tied behind him, and around him my Lord\nCarnal's four knaves. It was Diccon's voice that we had heard. He was\nstill speaking, and now we could distinguish the words.\n\n\"So Sir Thomas chains him there,\" he said,--\"right there to that tree\nunder which you are sitting, Jacky Bonhomme.\" Jacques incontinently\nshifted his position. \"He chains him there, with one chain around his\nneck, one around his waist, and one around his ankles. Then he sticks me\na bodkin through his tongue.\" A groan of admiration from his audience.\n\"Then they dig, before his very eyes, a grave,--shallow enough they\nmake it, too,--and they put into it, uncoffined, with only a long white\nshroud upon him, the man he murdered. Then they cover the grave. You're\nsitting on it now, you other Jacky.\"\n\n\"Godam!\" cried the rascal addressed, and removed with expedition to a\nless storied piece of ground.\n\n\"Then they go away,\" continued Diccon in graveyard tones. \"They all go\naway together,--Sir Thomas and Captain Argall, Captain West, Lieutenant\nGeorge Percy and his cousin, my master, and Sir Thomas's men; they go\nout of the wood as though it were accursed, though indeed it was not\nhalf so gloomy then as it is now. The sun shone into it then, sometimes,\nand the birds sang. You would n't think it from the looks of things now,\nwould you? As the dead man rotted in his grave, and the living man died\nby inches above him, they say the wood grew darker, and darker, and\ndarker. How dark it's getting now, and cold,--cold as the dead!\"\n\nHis auditors drew closer together, and shivered. Sparrow and I were so\nnear that we could see the hands of the ingenious story-teller, bound\nbehind his back, working as he talked. Now they strained this way, and\nnow that, at the piece of rope that bound them.\n\n\"That was ten years ago,\" he said, his voice becoming more and more\nimpressive. \"Since that day nothing comes into this wood,--nothing\nhuman, that is. Neither white man nor Indian comes, that's certain. Then\nwhy are n't there chains around that tree, and why are there no bones\nbeneath it, on the ground there? Because, Jackies all, the man that did\nthat murder walks! It is not always deadly still here; sometimes there\n's a clanking of chains! And a bodkin through the tongue can't keep the\ndead from wailing! And the murdered man walks, too; in his shroud he\nfollows the other--Is n't that something white in the distance yonder?\"\n\nMy lord's four knaves looked down the arcade of trees, and saw the\nsomething white as plainly as if it had been verily there. Each moment\nthe wood grew darker,--a thing in nature, since the sun outside was\nswiftly sinking to the horizon. But to those to whom that tale had been\ntold it was a darkening unearthly and portentous, bringing with it a\ncolder air and a deepened silence.\n\n\"Oh, Sir Thomas Dale, Sir Thomas Dale!\"\n\nThe voice seemed to come from the distance, and bore in its dismal\ncadence the melancholy of the damned. For a moment my heart stood still,\nand the hair of my head commenced to rise; the next, I knew that Diccon\nhad found an ally, not in the dead, but in the living. The minister,\nstanding beside me, opened his mouth again, and again that dismal voice\nrang through the wood, and again it seemed, by I know not what art, to\ncome from any spot rather than from that particular tree behind whose\ntrunk stood Master Jeremy Sparrow.\n\n\"Oh, the bodkin through my tongue! Oh, the bodkin through my tongue!\"\n\nTwo of the guard sat with hanging lip and lacklustre eyes, turned to\nstone; one, at full length upon the ground, bruised his face against\nthe pine needles and called on the Virgin; the fourth, panic-stricken,\nleaped to his feet and dashed off into the darkness, to trouble us no\nmore that day.\n\n\"Oh, the heavy chains!\" cried the unseen spectre. \"Oh, the dead man in\nhis grave!\"\n\nThe man on his face dug his nails into the earth and howled; his fellows\nwere too frightened for sound or motion. Diccon, a hardy rogue, with\nlittle fear of God or man, gave no sign of perturbation beyond a\ndesperate tugging at the rope about his wrists. He was ever quick to\ntake suggestion, and he had probably begun to question the nature of the\nghost who was doing him such yeoman service.\n\n\"D' ye think they've had enough?\" said Sparrow in my ear. \"My invention\nflaggeth.\"\n\nI nodded, too choked with laughter for speech, and drew my sword. The\nnext moment we were upon the men like wolves upon the fold.\n\nThey made no resistance. Amazed and shaken as they were, we might have\ndispatched them with all ease, to join the dead whose lamentations yet\nrang in their ears; but we contented ourselves with disarming them and\nbidding them begone for their lives in the direction of the Pamunkey.\nThey went like frightened deer, their one goal in life escape from the\nwood.\n\n\"Did you meet the Italian?\"\n\nI turned to find my wife at my side. The King's ward had a kingly\nspirit; she was not one that the dead or the living could daunt. To her,\nas to me, danger was a trumpet call to nerve heart and strengthen soul.\nShe had been in peril of that which she most feared, but the light in\nher eye was not quenched, and the hand with which she touched mine,\nthough cold, was steady.\n\n\"Is he dead?\" she asked. \"At court they called him the Black Death. They\nsaid\"--\n\n\"I did not kill him,\" I answered, \"but I will if you desire it.\"\n\n\"And his master?\" she demanded. \"What have you done with his master?\"\n\nI told her. At the vision my words conjured up her strained nerves gave\nway, and she broke into laughter as cruel as it was sweet. Peal after\npeal rang through the haunted wood, and increased the eeriness of the\nplace.\n\n\"The knot that I tied he will untie directly,\" I said. \"If we would\nreach Jamestown first, we had best be going.\"\n\n\"Night is upon us, too,\" said the minister, \"and this place hath the\nlook of the very valley of the shadow of death. If the spirits walk, it\nis hard upon their time--and I prefer to walk elsewhere.\"\n\n\"Cease your laughter, madam,\" I said. \"Should a boat be coming up this\nstream, you would betray us.\"\n\nI went over to Diccon, and in a silence as grim as his own cut the rope\nwhich bound his hands, which done we all moved through the deepening\ngloom to where we had left the horses, Jeremy Sparrow going on ahead to\nhave them in readiness. Presently he came hurrying back. \"The Italian is\ngone!\" he cried.\n\n\"Gone!\" I exclaimed. \"I told you to tie him fast to the saddle!\"\n\n\"Why, so I did,\" he replied. \"I drew the thongs so tight that they cut\ninto his flesh. He could not have endured to pull against them.\"\n\n\"Then how did he get away?\"\n\n\"Why,\" he answered, with a rueful countenance, \"I did bind him, as I\nhave said; but when I had done so, I bethought me of how the leather\nmust cut, and of how pain is dreadful even to a snake, and of the\ninjunction to do as you would be done by, and so e'en loosened his\nbonds. But, as I am a christened man, I thought that they would yet hold\nhim fast!\"\n\nI began to swear, but ended in vexed laughter. \"The milk's spilt. There\n's no use in crying over it. After all, we must have loosed him before\nwe entered the town.\"\n\n\"Will you not bring the matter before the Governor?\" he asked.\n\nI shook my head. \"If Yeardley did me right, he would put in jeopardy his\noffice and his person. This is my private quarrel, and I will draw no\nman into it against his will. Here are the horses, and we had best be\ngone, for by this time my lord and his physician may have their heads\ntogether again.\"\n\nI mounted Black Lamoral, and lifted Mistress Percy to a seat behind me.\nThe brown mare bore the minister and the negress, and Diccon, doggedly\nsilent, trudged beside us.\n\nWe passed through the haunted wood and the painted forest beyond without\nadventure. We rode in silence: the lady behind me too weary for speech,\nthe minister revolving in his mind the escape of the Italian, and I with\nmy own thoughts to occupy me. It was dusk when we crossed the neck\nof land, and as we rode down the street torches were being lit in the\nhouses. The upper room in the guest house was brightly illumined, and\nthe window was open. Black Lamoral and the brown mare made a trampling\nwith their hoofs, and I began to whistle a gay old tune I had learnt in\nthe wars. A figure in scarlet and black came to the window, and stood\nthere looking down upon us. The lady riding with me straightened herself\nand raised her weary head. \"The next time we go to the forest, Ralph,\"\nshe said in a clear, high voice, \"thou 'lt show me a certain tree,\" and\nshe broke into silvery laughter. She laughed until we had left behind\nthe guest house and the figure in the upper window, and then the\nlaughter changed to something like a sob. If there were pain and anger\nin her heart, pain and anger were in mine also. She had never called me\nby my name before. She had only used it now as a dagger with which to\nstab at that fierce heart above us.\n\nAt last we reached the minister's house, and dismounted before the door.\nDiccon led the horses away, and I handed my wife into the great room.\nThe minister tarried but for a few words anent some precautions that I\nmeant to take, and then betook himself to his own chamber. As he went\nout of the door Diccon entered the room.\n\n\"Oh, I am weary!\" sighed Mistress Jocelyn Percy. \"What was the mighty\nbusiness, Captain Percy, that made you break tryst with a lady? You\nshould go to court, sir, to be taught gallantry.\"\n\n\"Where should a wife go to be taught obedience?\" I demanded. \"You know\nwhere I went and why I could not keep tryst. Why did you not obey my\norders?\"\n\nShe opened wide her eyes. \"Your orders? I never received any,--not that\nI should have obeyed them if I had. Know where you went? I know neither\nwhy nor where you went!\"\n\nI leaned my hand upon the table, and looked from her to Diccon.\n\n\"I was sent by the Governor to quell a disturbance amongst the nearest\nIndians. The woods today have been full of danger. Moreover, the plan\nthat we made yesterday was overheard by the Italian. When I had to go\nthis morning without seeing you, I left you word where I had gone and\nwhy, and also my commands that you should not stir outside the garden.\nWere you not told this, madam?\"\n\n\"No!\" she cried.\n\nI looked at Diccon. \"I told madam that you were called away on\nbusiness,\" he said sullenly. \"I told her that you were sorry you could\nnot go with her to the woods.\"\n\n\"You told her nothing more?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"May I ask why?\"\n\nHe threw back his head. \"I did not believe the Paspaheghs would trouble\nher,\" he answered, with hardihood, \"and you had n't seen fit, sir, to\ntell me of the other danger. Madam wanted to go, and I thought it a pity\nthat she should lose her pleasure for nothing.\"\n\nI had been hunting the day before, and my whip yet lay upon the table.\n\"I have known you for a hardy rogue,\" I said, with my hand upon it; \"now\nI know you for a faithless one as well. If I gave you credit for all the\nvices of the soldier, I gave you credit also for his virtues. I was the\nmore deceived. The disobedient servant I might pardon, but the soldier\nwho is faithless to his trust\"--\n\nI raised the whip and brought it down again and again across his\nshoulders. He stood without a word, his face dark red and his hands\nclenched at his sides. For a minute or more there was no sound in the\nroom save the sound of the blows; then my wife suddenly cried out: \"It\nis enough! You have beaten him enough! Let him go, sir!\"\n\nI threw down the whip. \"Begone, sirrah!\" I ordered. \"And keep out of my\nsight to-morrow!\"\n\nWith his face still dark red and with a pulse beating fiercely in his\ncheek, he moved slowly toward the door, turned when he had reached it\nand saluted, then went out and closed it after him.\n\n\"Now he too will be your enemy,\" said Mistress Percy, \"and all through\nme. I have brought you many enemies, have I not? Perhaps you count me\namongst them? I should not wonder if you did. Do you not wish me gone\nfrom Virginia?\"\n\n\"So I were with you, madam,\" I said bluntly, and went to call the\nminister down to supper.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI IN WHICH I AM RID OF AN UNPROFITABLE SERVANT\n\n\nTHE next day, Governor and Councilors sat to receive presents from\nthe Paspaheghs and to listen to long and affectionate messages from\nOpechancanough, who, like the player queen, did protest too much. The\nCouncil met at Yeardley's house, and I was called before it to make my\nreport of the expedition of the day before. It was late afternoon when\nthe Governor dismissed us, and I found myself leaving the house in\ncompany with Master Pory.\n\n\"I am bound for my lord's,\" said that worthy as we neared the guest\nhouse. \"My lord hath Xeres wine that is the very original nectar of the\ngods, and he drinks it from goblets worth a king's ransom. We have heard\na deal to-day about burying hatchets: bury thine for the nonce, Ralph\nPercy, and come drink with us.\"\n\n\"Not I,\" I said. \"I would sooner drink with--some one else.\"\n\nHe laughed. \"Here's my lord himself shall persuade you.\"\n\nMy lord, dressed with his usual magnificence and darkly handsome as\never, was indeed standing within the guest-house door. Pory drew up\nbeside him. I was passing on with a slight bow, when the Secretary\ncaught me by the sleeve. At the Governor's house wine had been set forth\nto revive the jaded Council, and he was already half seas over. \"Tarry\nwith us, captain!\" he cried. \"Good wine's good wine, no matter who pours\nit! 'S bud! in my young days men called a truce and forgot they were\nfoes when the bottle went round!\"\n\n\"If Captain Percy will stay,\" quoth my lord, \"I will give him welcome\nand good wine. As Master Pory says, men cannot be always fighting. A\nbreathing spell to-day gives to-morrow's struggle new zest.\"\n\nHe spoke frankly, with open face and candid eyes. I was not fooled.\nIf yesterday he would have slain me only in fair fight, it was not so\nto-day. Under the lace that fell over his wrist was a red cirque, the\nmark of the thong with which I had bound him. As if he had told me, I\nknew that he had thrown his scruples to the winds, and that he cared not\nwhat foul play he used to sweep me from his path. My spirit and my\nwit rose to meet the danger. Of a sudden I resolved to accept his\ninvitation.\n\n\"So be it,\" I said, with a laugh and a shrug of my shoulders. \"A cup of\nwine is no great matter. I'll take it at your hands, my lord, and drink\nto our better acquaintance.\"\n\nWe all three went up into my lord's room. The King had fitted out his\nminion bravely for the Virginia voyage, and the riches that had decked\nthe state cabin aboard the Santa Teresa now served to transform the bare\nroom in the guest house at Jamestown into a corner of Whitehall. The\nwalls were hung with arras, there was a noble carpet beneath as well as\nupon the table, and against the wall stood richly carved trunks. On the\ntable, beside a bowl of late flowers were a great silver flagon and\na number of goblets, some of chased silver and some of colored glass,\nstrangely shaped and fragile as an eggshell. The late sun now shining in\nat the open window made the glass to glow like precious stones.\n\nMy lord rang a little silver bell, and a door behind us was opened.\n\"Wine, Giles!\" cried my lord in a raised voice. \"Wine for Master Pory,\nCaptain Percy, and myself! And Giles, my two choice goblets.\"\n\nGiles, whom I had never seen before, advanced to the table, took the\nflagon, and went toward the door, which he had shut behind him. I\nnegligently turned in my seat, and so came in for a glimpse, as he\nslipped through the door, of a figure in black in the next room.\n\nThe wine was brought, and with it two goblets. My lord broke off in the\nmidst of an account of the morning's bear-baiting which the tediousness\nof the Indians had caused us to miss. \"Who knows if we three shall\never drink together again?\" he said. \"To honor this bout I use my most\nprecious cups.\" Voice and manner were free and unconstrained. \"This gold\ncup \"--he held it up--\"belonged to the Medici. Master Pory, who is a man\nof taste, will note the beauty of the graven maenads upon this side, and\nof the Bacchus and Ariadne upon this. It is the work of none other than\nBenvenuto Cellini. I pour for you, sir.\" He filled the gold cup with\nthe ruby wine and set it before the Secretary, who eyed it with all the\npassion of a lover, and waited not for us, but raised it to his lips\nat once. My lord took up the other cup. \"This glass,\" he continued, \"as\ngreen as an emerald, freckled inside and out with gold, and shaped like\na lily, was once amongst a convent's treasures. My father brought it\nfrom Italy, years ago. I use it as he used it, only on gala days. I fill\nto you, sir.\" He poured the wine into the green and gold and twisted\nbauble and set it before me, then filled a silver goblet for himself.\n\"Drink, gentlemen,\" he said.\n\n\"Faith, I have drunken already,\" quoth the Secretary, and proceeded\nto fill for himself a second time. \"Here's to you, gentlemen!\" and he\nemptied half the measure.\n\n\"Captain Percy does not drink,\" remarked my lord.\n\nI leaned my elbow upon the table, and, holding up the glass against the\nlight, began to admire its beauty. \"The tint is wonderful,\" I said, \"as\nlucent a green as the top of the comber that is to break and overwhelm\nyou. And these knobs of gold, within and without, and the strange shape\nthe tortured glass has been made to take. I find it of a quite sinister\nbeauty, my lord.\"\n\n\"It hath been much admired,\" said the nobleman addressed.\n\n\"I am strangely suited, my lord,\" I went on, still dreamily enjoying\nthe beauty of the green gem within my clasp. \"I am a soldier with an\nimagination. Sometimes, to give the rein to my fancy pleases me more\nthan wine. Now, this strange chalice,--might it not breed dreams as\nstrange?\"\n\n\"When I had drunken, I think,\" replied my lord. \"The wine would be a\npotent spur to my fancy.\"\n\n\"What saith honest Jack Falstaff?\" broke in the maudlin Secretary. \"Doth\nhe not bear testimony that good sherris maketh the brain apprehensive\nand quick; filleth it with nimble, fiery, and delectable shapes, which\nbeing delivered by the tongue become excellent wit? Wherefore let us\ndrink, gentlemen, and beget fancies.\" He filled for himself again, and\nburied his nose in the cup.\n\n\"'T is such a cup, methinks,\" I said, \"as Medea may have filled for\nTheseus. The white hand of Circe may have closed around this stem when\nshe stood to greet Ulysses, and knew not that he had the saving herb in\nhis palm. Goneril may have sent this green and gilded shape to Regan.\nFair Rosamond may have drunk from it while the Queen watched her. At\nsome voluptuous feast, Caesar Borgia and his sister, sitting crowned with\nroses, side by side, may have pressed it upon a reluctant guest, who\nhad, perhaps, a treasure of his own. I dare swear Rene, the Florentine,\nhath fingered many such a goblet before it went to whom Catherine de'\nMedici delighted to honor.\"\n\n\"She had the whitest hands,\" maundered the Secretary. \"I kissed them\nonce before she died, in Blois, when I was young. Rene was one of your\nslow poisoners. Smell a rose, draw on a pair of perfumed gloves, drink\nfrom a certain cup, and you rang your own knell, though your bier might\nnot receive you for many and many a day,--not till the rose was dust,\nthe gloves lost, the cup forgotten.\"\n\n\"There's a fashion I have seen followed abroad, that I like,\" I said.\n\"Host and guest fill to each other, then change tankards. You are my\nhost to-day, my lord, and I am your guest. I will drink to you, my lord,\nfrom your silver goblet.\"\n\nWith as frank a manner as his own of a while before, I pushed the green\nand gold glass over to him, and held out my hand for the silver goblet.\nThat a man may smile and smile and be a villain is no new doctrine. My\nlord's laugh and gesture of courtesy were as free and ready as if the\npoisoned splendor he drew toward him had been as innocent as a pearl\nwithin the shell. I took the silver cup from before him. \"I drink to\nthe King,\" I said, and drained it to the bottom. \"Your lordship does not\ndrink. 'T is a toast no man refuses.\"\n\nHe raised the glass to his lips, but set it down before its rim had\ntouched them. \"I have a headache,\" he declared. \"I will not drink\nto-day.\"\n\nMaster Pory pulled the flagon toward him, tilted it, and found it\nempty. His rueful face made me laugh. My lord laughed too,--somewhat\nloudly,--but ordered no more wine. \"I would I were at the Mermaid\nagain,\" lamented the now drunken Secretary. \"There we did n't split a\nflagon in three parts.... The Tsar of Muscovy drinks me down a quartern\nof aqua vitae at a gulp,--I've seen him do it....I would I were the\nBacchus on this cup, with the purple grapes adangle above me.... Wine\nand women--wine and women... good wine needs no bush... good sherris\nsack\"... His voice died into unintelligible mutterings, and his gray\nunreverend head sank upon the table.\n\nI rose, leaving him to his drunken slumbers, and, bowing to my lord,\ntook my leave. My lord followed me down to the public room below. A\nparty of upriver planters had been drinking, and a bit of chalk lay upon\na settle behind the door upon which the landlord had marked their score.\nI passed it; then turned back and picked it up. \"How long a line shall I\ndraw, my lord?\" I asked with a smile.\n\n\"How does the length of the door strike you?\" he answered.\n\nI drew the chalk from top to bottom of the wood. \"A heavy Core makes a\nheavy reckoning, my lord,\" I said, and, leaving the mark upon the door,\nI bowed again and went out into the street.\n\nThe sun was sinking when I reached the minister's house, and going into\nthe great room drew a stool to the table and sat down to think. Mistress\nPercy was in her own chamber; in the room overhead the minister paced up\nand down, humming a psalm. A fire was burning briskly upon the hearth,\nand the red light rose and fell,--now brightening all the room, now\nleaving it to the gathering dusk. Through the door, which I had left\nopen, came the odor of the pines, the fallen leaves, and the damp earth.\nIn the churchyard an owl hooted, and the murmur of the river was louder\nthan usual.\n\nI had sat staring at the table before me for perhaps half an hour, when\nI chanced to raise my eyes to the opposite wall. Now, on this wall,\nreflecting the firelight and the open door behind me, hung a small\nVenetian mirror, which I had bought from a number of such toys brought\nin by the Southampton, and had given to Mistress Percy. My eyes rested\nupon it, idly at first, then closely enough as I saw within it a man\nenter the room. I had heard no footfall; there was no noise now behind\nme. The fire was somewhat sunken, and the room was almost in darkness;\nI saw him in the glass dimly, as shadow rather than substance. But the\nlight was not so faint that the mirror could not show me the raised\nhand and the dagger within its grasp. I sat without motion, watching\nthe figure in the glass grow larger. When it was nearly upon me, and the\nhand with the dagger drawn back for the blow, I sprang up, wheeled, and\ncaught it by the wrist.\n\nA moment's fierce struggle, and I had the dagger in my own hand and\nthe man at my mercy. The fire upon the hearth seized on a pine knot and\nblazed up brightly, filling the room with light. \"Diccon!\" I cried, and\ndropped my arm.\n\nI had never thought of this. The room was very quiet as, master and man,\nwe stood and looked each other in the face. He fell back to the wall and\nleaned against it, breathing heavily; into the space between us the past\ncame thronging.\n\nI opened my hand and let the dagger drop to the floor. \"I suppose that\nthis was because of last night,\" I said. \"I shall never strike you\nagain.\"\n\nI went to the table, and sitting down leaned my forehead upon my hand.\nIt was Diccon who would have done this thing! The fire crackled on the\nhearth as had crackled the old camp fires in Flanders; the wind outside\nwas the wind that had whistled through the rigging of the Treasurer,\none terrible night when we lashed ourselves to the same mast and never\nthought to see the morning. Diccon!\n\nUpon the table was the minister's inkhorn and pen. I drew my tablets\nfrom the breast of my doublet and began to write. \"Diccon!\" I called,\nwithout turning, when I had finished.\n\nHe came slowly forward to the table, and stood beside it with hanging\nhead. I tore the leaf from the book and pushed it over to him. \"Take\nit,\" I ordered.\n\n\"To the commander?\" he asked. \"I am to take it to the commander?\"\n\nI shook my head. \"Read it.\"\n\nHe stared at it vacantly, turning it now this way, now that.\n\n\"Did you forget how to read when you forgot all else?\" I said sternly.\n\nHe read, and the color rushed into his face.\n\n\"It is your freedom,\" I said. \"You are no longer man of mine. Begone,\nsirrah!\"\n\nHe crumpled the paper in his hand. \"I was mad,\" he muttered.\n\n\"I could almost believe it,\" I replied. \"Begone!\"\n\nAfter a moment he went. Sitting still in my place, I heard him heavily\nand slowly leave the room, descend the step at the door, and go out into\nthe night.\n\nA door opened, and Mistress Jocelyn Percy came into the great room, like\na sunbeam strayed back to earth. Her skirt was of flowered satin, her\nbodice of rich taffeta; between the gossamer walls of her French ruff\nrose the whitest neck to meet the fairest face. Upon her dark hair sat,\nas lightly as a kiss, a little pearl-bordered cap. A color was in her\ncheeks and a laugh on her lips. The rosy light of the burning pine\ncaressed her,--now dwelling on the rich dress, now on the gold chain\naround the slender waist, now on rounded arms, now on the white forehead\nbelow the pearls. Well, she was a fair lady for a man to lay down his\nlife for.\n\n\"I held court this afternoon!\" she cried. \"Where were you, sir? Madam\nWest was here, and my Lady Temperance Yeardley, and Master Wynne,\nand Master Thorpe from Henricus, and Master Rolfe with his Indian\nbrother,--who, I protest, needs but silk doublet and hose and a month at\nWhitehall to make him a very fine gentleman.\"\n\n\"If courage, steadfastness, truth, and courtesy make a gentleman,\" I\nsaid, \"he is one already. Such an one needs not silk doublet nor court\ntraining.\"\n\nShe looked at me with her bright eyes. \"No,\" she repeated, \"such an one\nneeds not silk doublet nor court training.\" Going to the fire, she stood\nwith one hand upon the mantelshelf, looking down into the ruddy hollows.\nPresently she stooped and gathered up something from the hearth. \"You\nwaste paper strangely, Captain Percy,\" she said. \"Here is a whole\nhandful of torn pieces.\"\n\nShe came over to the table, and with a laugh showered the white\nfragments down upon it, then fell to idly piecing them together. \"What\nwere you writing?\" she asked. \"'To all whom it may concern: I, Ralph\nPercy, Gentleman, of the Hundred of Weyanoke, do hereby set free from\nall service to me and mine'\"--\n\nI took from her the bits of paper, and fed the fire with them. \"Paper\nis but paper,\" I said. \"It is easily rent. Happily a man's will is more\ndurable.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII IN WHICH MY LORD AND I PLAY AT BOWLS\n\n\nTHE Governor had brought with him from London the year before, a set\nof boxwood bowls, and had made, between his house and the fort, a noble\ngreen. The generality must still use for the game that portion of the\nstreet that was not tobacco-planted; but the quality flocked to the\nGovernor's green, and here, one holiday afternoon, a fortnight or more\nfrom the day in which I had drunk to the King from my lord's silver\ngoblet, was gathered a very great company. The Governor's match\nwas toward,--ten men to a side, a hogshead of sweet-scented to the\nvictorious ten, and a keg of canary to the man whose bowl should hit the\njack.\n\nThe season had been one of unusual mildness, and the sunshine was still\nwarm and bright, gilding the velvet of the green, and making the red and\nyellow leaves swept into the trench to glow like a ribbon of flame. The\nsky was blue, the water bluer still, the leaves bright-colored, the wind\nblowing; only the enshrouding forest, wrapped in haze, seemed as dim,\nunreal, and far away as a last year's dream.\n\nThe Governor's gilt armchair had been brought from the church, and put\nfor him upon the bank of turf at the upper end of the green. By his side\nsat my Lady Temperance, while the gayly dressed dames and the men who\nwere to play and to watch were accommodated with stools and settles or\nwith seats on the green grass. All were dressed in holiday clothes, all\ntongues spoke, all eyes laughed; you might have thought there was not a\nheavy heart amongst them. Rolfe was there, gravely courteous, quiet\nand ready; and by his side, in otterskin mantle, beaded moccasins, and\nfeathered headdress, the Indian chief, his brother-in-law,--the bravest,\ncomeliest, and manliest savage with whom I have ever dealt. There, too,\nwas Master Pory, red and jovial, with an eye to the sack the servants\nwere bringing from the Governor's house; and the commander, with his\nwife; and Master Jeremy Sparrow, fresh from a most moving sermon on the\nvanities of this world. Captains, Councilors, and Burgesses aired their\ngold lace, and their wit or their lack of it; while a swarm of younger\nadventurers, youths of good blood and bad living, come from home for the\nweal of England and the woe of Virginia, went here and there through the\ncrowd like gilded summer flies.\n\nRolfe and I were to play; he sat on the grass at the feet of Mistress\nJocelyn Percy, making her now and then some courtly speech, and I stood\nbeside her, my hand on the back of her chair.\n\nThe King's ward held court as though she were a king's daughter. In the\nbrightness of her beauty she sat there, as gracious for the nonce as the\nsunshine, and as much of another world. All knew her story, and to the\ndaring that is in men's hearts her own daring appealed,--and she was\nyoung and very beautiful. Some there had not been my friends, and now\nrejoiced in what seemed my inevitable ruin; some whom I had thought my\nfriends were gone over to the stronger side; many who in secret wished\nme well still shook their heads and shrugged their shoulders over what\nthey were pleased to call my madness; but for her, I was glad to know,\nthere were only good words. The Governor had left his gilt armchair to\nwelcome her to the green, and had caused a chair to be set for her near\nhis own, and here men came and bowed before her as if she had been a\nprincess indeed.\n\nA stir amongst the crowd, a murmur, and a craning of necks heralded the\napproach of that other at whom the town gaped with admiration. He came\nwith his retinue of attendants, his pomp of dress, his arrogance of\nport, his splendid beauty. Men looked from the beauty of the King's ward\nto the beauty of the King's minion, from her costly silk to his velvet\nand miniver, from the air of the court that became her well to the\ntowering pride and insolence which to the thoughtless seemed his\nfortune's proper mantle, and deemed them a pair well suited, and the\nKing's will indeed the will of Heaven.\n\nI was never one to value a man by his outward seeming, but suddenly I\nsaw myself as in a mirror,--a soldier, scarred and bronzed, acquainted\nwith the camp, but not with the court, roughened by a rude life, poor in\nthis world's goods, the first flush of youth gone forever. For a moment\nmy heart was bitter within me. The pang passed, and my hand tightened\nits grasp upon the chair in which sat the woman I had wed. She was my\nwife, and I would keep my own.\n\nMy lord had paused to speak to the Governor, who had risen to greet him.\nNow he came toward us, and the crowd pressed and whispered. He bowed\nlow to Mistress Percy, made as if to pass on, then came to a stop before\nher, his hat in his hand, his handsome head bent, a smile upon his\nbearded lips.\n\n\"When was it that we last sat to see men bowl, lady?\" he said. \"I\nremember a gay match when I bowled against my Lord of Buckingham, and\nfair ladies sat and smiled upon us. The fairest laughed, and tied her\ncolors around my arm.\"\n\nThe lady whom he addressed sat quietly, with hands folded in her silken\nlap and an untroubled face. \"I did not know you then, my lord,\" she\nanswered him, quite softly and sweetly. \"Had I done so, be sure I\nwould have cut my hand off ere it gave color of mine to\"--\"To whom?\" he\ndemanded, as she paused.\n\n\"To a coward, my lord,\" she said clearly.\n\nAs if she had been a man, his hand went to his sword hilt. As for her,\nshe leaned back in her chair and looked at him with a smile.\n\nHe spoke at last, slowly and with deliberate emphasis. \"I won then,\" he\nsaid. \"I shall win again, my lady,--my Lady Jocelyn Leigh.\"\n\nI dropped my hand from her chair and stepped forward. \"It is my wife\nto whom you speak, my Lord Carnal,\" I said sternly. \"I wait to hear you\nname her rightly.\"\n\nRolfe rose from the grass and stood beside me, and Jeremy Sparrow,\nshouldering aside with scant ceremony Burgess and Councilor, came also.\nThe Governor leaned forward out of his chair, and the crowd became\nsuddenly very still.\n\n\"I am waiting, my lord,\" I repeated.\n\nIn an instant, from what he had been he became the frank and guileless\nnobleman. \"A slip of the tongue, Captain Percy!\" he cried, his white\nteeth showing and his hand raised in a gesture of deprecation. \"A\nnatural thing, seeing how often, how very often, I have so\naddressed this lady in the days when we had not the pleasure of your\nacquaintance.\" He turned to her and bowed, until the feather in his hat\nswept the ground. \"I won then,\" he said. \"I shall win again--Mistress\nPercy,\" and passed on to the seat that had been reserved for him.\n\nThe game began. I was to lead one side, and young Clement the other. At\nthe last moment he came over to me. \"I am out of it, Captain Percy,\"\nhe announced with a rueful face. \"My lord there asks me to give him my\nplace. When we were hunting yesterday, and the stag turned upon me, he\ncame between and thrust his knife into the brute, which else might have\nput an end to my hunting forever and a day: so you see I can't refuse\nhim. Plague take it all! and Dorothy Gookin sitting there watching!\"\n\nMy lord and I stood forward, each with a bowl in his hand. We looked\ntoward the Governor. \"My lord first, as becometh his rank,\" he said.\nMy lord stooped and threw, and his bowl went swiftly over the grass,\nturned, and rested not a hands'-breadth from the jack. I threw. \"One\nis as near as the other!\" cried Master Macocke for the judges. A murmur\narose from the crowd, and my lord swore beneath his breath. He and I\nretreated to our several sides, and Rolfe and West took our places.\nWhile they and those that followed bowled, the crowd, attentive though\nit was, still talked and laughed, and laid wagers upon its favorites;\nbut when my lord and I again stood forth, the noise was hushed, and men\nand women stared with all their eyes. He delivered, and his bowl touched\nthe jack. He straightened himself, with a smile, and I heard Jeremy\nSparrow behind me groan; but my bowl too kissed the jack. The crowd\nbegan to laugh with sheer delight, but my lord turned red and his brows\ndrew together. We had but one turn more. While we waited, I marked his\nblack eyes studying every inch of the ground between him and that small\nwhite ball, to strike which, at that moment, I verily believe he would\nhave given the King's favor. All men pray, though they pray not to the\nsame god. As he stood there, when his time had come, weighing the bowl\nin his hand, I knew that he prayed to his daemon, fate, star, whatever\nthing he raised an altar to and bent before. He threw, and I followed,\nwhile the throng held its breath. Master Macocke rose to his feet. \"It's\na tie, my masters!\" he exclaimed.\n\nThe excited crowd surged forward, and a babel of voices arose. \"Silence,\nall!\" cried the Governor. \"Let them play it out!\"\n\nMy lord threw, and his bowl stopped perilously near the shining mark. As\nI stepped to my place a low and supplicating \"O Lord!\" came to my\nears from the lips and the heart of the preacher, who had that morning\nthundered against the toys of this world. I drew back my arm and threw\nwith all my force. A cry arose from the throng, and my lord ground his\nheel into the earth. The bowl, spurning the jack before it, rushed on,\nuntil both buried themselves in the red and yellow leaves that filled\nthe trench.\n\nI turned and bowed to my antagonist. \"You bowl well, my lord,\" I said.\n\"Had you had the forest training of eye and arm, our fortunes might have\nbeen reversed.\"\n\nHe looked me up and down. \"You are kind, sir,\" he said thickly.\n\"'To-day to thee, to-morrow to me.' I give you joy of your petty\nvictory.\"\n\nHe turned squarely from me, and stood with his face downstream. I was\nspeaking to Rolfe and to the few--not even all of that side for which I\nhad won--who pressed around me, when he wheeled.\n\n\"Your Honor,\" he cried to the Governor, who had paused beside Mistress\nPercy, \"is not the Due Return high-pooped? Doth she not carry a blue\npennant, and hath she not a gilt siren for figurehead?\"\n\n\"Ay,\" answered the Governor, lifting his head from the hand he had\nkissed with ponderous gallantry. \"What then, my lord?\"\n\n\"Then to-morrow has dawned, sir captain,\" said my lord to me. \"Sure,\nDame Venus and her blind son have begged for me favorable winds; for the\nDue Return has come again.\"\n\nThe game that had been played was forgotten for that day. The hogshead\nof sweet scented, lying to one side, wreathed with bright vines, was\nunclaimed of either party; the servants who brought forward the keg of\ncanary dropped their burden, and stared with the rest. All looked down\nthe river, and all saw the Due Return coming up the broad, ruffled\nstream, the wind from the sea filling her sails, the tide with her, the\ngilt mermaid on her prow just rising from the rushing foam. She came as\nswiftly as a bird to its nest. None had thought to see her for at least\nten days.\n\nUpon all there fell a sudden realization that it was the word of the\nKing, feathered by the command of the Company, that was hurrying,\narrow-like, toward us. All knew what the Company's orders would\nbe,--must needs be,--and the Tudor sovereigns were not so long in the\ngrave that men had forgot to fear the wrath of kings. The crowd drew\nback from me as from a man plague-spotted. Only Rolfe, Sparrow, and the\nIndian stood their ground.\n\nThe Governor turned from staring downstream. \"The game is played,\ngentlemen,\" he announced abruptly. \"The wind grows colder, too, and\nclouds are gathering. This fair company will pardon me if I dismiss them\nsomewhat sooner than is our wont. The next sunny day we will play again.\nGive you God den, gentles.\"\n\nThe crowd stood not upon the order of its going, but streamed away to\nthe river bank, whence it could best watch the oncoming ship. My lord,\nafter a most triumphant bow, swept off with his train in the direction\nof the guest house. With him went Master Pory. The Governor drew nearer\nto me. \"Captain Percy,\" he said, lowering his voice, \"I am going now to\nmine own house. The letters which yonder ship brings will be in my hands\nin less than an hour. When I have read them, I shall perforce obey their\ninstructions. Before I have them I will see you, if you so wish.\"\n\n\"I will be with your Honor in five minutes.\"\n\nHe nodded, and strode off across the green to his garden. I turned to\nRolfe. \"Will you take her home?\" I said briefly. She was so white and\nsat so still in her chair that I feared to see her swoon. But when\nI spoke to her she answered clearly and steadily enough, even with a\nsmile, and she would not lean upon Rolfe's arm. \"I will walk alone,\" she\nsaid. \"None that see me shall think that I am stricken down.\" I watched\nher move away, Rolfe beside her, and the Indian following with his\nnoiseless step; then I went to the Governor's house. Master Jeremy\nSparrow had disappeared some minutes before, I knew not whither.\n\nI found Yeardley in his great room, standing before a fire and staring\ndown into its hollows. \"Captain Percy,\" he said, as I went up to him, \"I\nam most heartily sorry for you and for the lady whom you so ignorantly\nmarried.\"\n\n\"I shall not plead ignorance,\" I told him.\n\n\"You married, not the Lady Jocelyn Leigh, but a waiting woman named\nPatience Worth. The Lady Jocelyn Leigh, a noble lady, and a ward of\nthe King, could not marry without the King's consent. And you, Captain\nPercy, are but a mere private gentleman, a poor Virginia adventurer;\nand my Lord Carnal is--my Lord Carnal. The Court of High Commission will\nmake short work of this fantastic marriage.\"\n\n\"Then they may do it without my aid,\" I said. \"Come, Sir George, had\nyou wed my Lady Temperance in such fashion, and found this hornets' nest\nabout your ears, what would you have done?\"\n\nHe gave his short, honest laugh. \"It's beside the question, Ralph Percy,\nbut I dare say you can guess what I would have done.\"\n\n\"I'll fight for my own to the last ditch,\" I continued. \"I married her\nknowing her name, if not her quality. Had I known the latter, had I\nknown she was the King's ward, all the same I should have married her,\nan she would have had me. She is my wife in the sight of God and honest\nmen. Esteeming her honor, which is mine, at stake, Death may silence me,\nbut men shall not bend me.\"\n\n\"Your best hope is in my Lord of Buckingham,\" he said. \"They say it\nis out of sight, out of mind, with the King, and, thanks to this\ninfatuation of my Lord Carnal's, Buckingham hath the field. That he\nstrains every nerve to oust completely this his first rival since he\nhimself distanced Somerset goes without saying. That to thwart my lord\nin this passion would be honey to him is equally of course. I do not\nneed to tell you that, if the Company so orders, I shall have no choice\nbut to send you and the lady home to England. When you are in London,\nmake your suit to my Lord of Buckingham, and I earnestly hope that you\nmay find in him an ally powerful enough to bring you and the lady, to\nwhose grace, beauty, and courage we all do homage, out of this coil.\"\n\n\"We give you thanks, sir,\" I said.\n\n\"As you know,\" he went on, \"I have written to the Company, humbly\npetitioning that I be graciously relieved from a most thankless task,\nto wit, the governorship of Virginia. My health faileth, and I am,\nmoreover, under my Lord Warwick's displeasure. He waxeth ever stronger\nin the Company, and if I put not myself out, he will do it for me. If\nI be relieved at once, and one of the Council appointed in my place, I\nshall go home to look after certain of my interests there. Then shall I\nbe but a private gentleman, and if I can serve you, Ralph Percy, I shall\nbe blithe to do so; but now, you understand\"--\n\n\"I understand, and thank you, Sir George,\" I said. \"May I ask one\nquestion?\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Will you obey to the letter the instructions the Company sends?\"\n\n\"To the letter,\" he answered. \"I am its sworn officer.\"\n\n\"One thing more,\" I went on: \"the parole I gave you, sir, that morning\nbehind the church, is mine own again when you shall have read those\nletters and know the King's will. I am free from that bond, at least.\"\n\nHe looked at me with a frown. \"Make not bad worse, Captain Percy,\" he\nsaid sternly.\n\nI laughed. \"It is my aim to make bad better, Sir George. I see through\nthe window that the Due Return hath come to anchor; I will no longer\ntrespass on your Honor's time.\" I bowed myself out, leaving him still\nwith the frown upon his face, staring at the fire.\n\nWithout, the world was bathed in the glow of a magnificent sunset.\nClouds, dark purple and dark crimson, reared themselves in the west to\ndizzy heights, and hung threateningly over the darkening land beneath.\nIn the east loomed more pallid masses, and from the bastions of the east\nto the bastions of the west went hurrying, wind-driven cloudless, dark\nin the east, red in the west. There was a high wind, and the river,\nwhere it was not reddened by the sunset, was lividly green. \"A storm,\ntoo!\" I muttered.\n\nAs I passed the guest house, there came to me from within a burst of\nloud and vaunting laughter and a boisterous drinking catch sung by many\nvoices; and I knew that my lord drank, and gave others to drink, to the\norders which the Due Return should bring. The minister's house was\nin darkness. In the great room I struck a light and fired the fresh\ntorches, and found I was not its sole occupant. On the hearth, the ashes\nof the dead fire touching her skirts, sat Mistress Jocelyn Percy, her\narms resting upon a low stool, and her head pillowed upon them. Her face\nwas not hidden: it was cold and pure and still, like carven marble. I\nstood and gazed at her a moment; then, as she did not offer to move, I\nbrought wood to the fire and made the forlorn room bright again.\n\n\"Where is Rolfe?\" I asked at last.\n\n\"He would have stayed,\" she answered, \"but I made him go. I wished to\nbe alone.\" She rose, and going to the window leaned her forehead against\nthe bars, and looked out upon the wild sky and the hurrying river. \"I\nwould I were alone,\" she said in a low voice and with a catch of her\nbreath. As she stood there in the twilight by the window, I knew that\nshe was weeping, though her pride strove to keep that knowledge from me.\nMy heart ached for her, and I knew not how to comfort her. At last she\nturned. A pasty and stoup of wine were upon the table.\n\n\"You are tired and shaken,\" I said, \"and you may need all your strength.\nCome, eat and drink.\"\n\n\"For to-morrow we die,\" she added, and broke into tremulous laughter.\nHer lashes were still wet, but her pride and daring had returned. She\ndrank the wine I poured for her, and we spoke of indifferent things,--of\nthe game that afternoon, of the Indian Nantauquas, of the wild night\nthat clouds and wind portended. Supper over, I called Angela to bear\nher company, and I myself went out into the night, and down the street\ntoward the guest house.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII IN WHICH WE GO OUT INTO THE NIGHT\n\n\nTHE guest house was aflame with lights. As I neared it, there was\nborne to my ears a burst of drunken shouts accompanied by a volley of\nmusketry. My lord was pursuing with a vengeance our senseless fashion\nof wasting in drinking bouts powder that would have been better spent\nagainst the Indians. The noise increased. The door was flung open, and\nthere issued a tide of drawers and servants headed by mine host himself,\nand followed by a hail of such minor breakables as the house contained\nand by Olympian laughter.\n\nI made my way past the indignant host and his staff, and standing upon\nthe threshold looked at the riot within. The long room was thick with\nthe smoke of tobacco and the smoke of powder, through which the many\ntorches burned yellow. Upon the great table wine had been spilt, and\ndripped to swell a red pool upon the floor. Underneath the table, still\ngrasping his empty tankard, lay the first of my lord's guests to fall,\nan up-river Burgess with white hair. The rest of the company were fast\nreeling to a like fate. Young Hamor had a fiddle, and, one foot upon a\nsettle, the other upon the table, drew across it a fast and furious bow.\nMaster Pory, arrived at the maudlin stage, alternately sang a slow and\nmelancholy ditty and wiped the tears from his eyes with elaborate\ncare. Master Edward Sharpless, now in a high voice, now in an\nundistinguishable murmur, argued some imaginary case. Peaceable Sherwood\nwas drunk, and Giles Allen, and Pettiplace Clause. Captain John Martin,\nsitting with outstretched legs, called now for a fresh tankard, which\nhe emptied at a gulp; now for his pistols, which, as fast as my lord's\nservants brought them to him new primed, he discharged at the ceiling.\nThe loud wind rattled doors and windows, and made the flame of the\ntorches stream sideways. The music grew madder and madder, the shots\nmore frequent, the drunken voices thicker and louder.\n\nThe master of the feast carried his wine better than did his guests,\nor had drunk less, but his spirit too was quite without bounds. A color\nburned in his cheeks, a wicked light in his eyes; he laughed to himself.\nIn the gray smoke cloud he saw me not, or saw me only as one of the many\nwho thronged the doorway and stared at the revel within. He raised his\nsilver cup with a slow and wavering hand. \"Drink, you dogs!\" he chanted.\n\"Drink to the Santa Teresa! Drink to to-morrow night! Drink to a proud\nlady within my arms and an enemy in my power!\"\n\nThe wine that had made him mad had maddened those others, also. In that\nhour they were dead to honor. With shameless laughter and as little\nspilling as might be, they raised their tankards as my lord raised his.\nA stone thrown by some one behind me struck the cup from my lord's hand,\nsending it clattering to the floor and dashing him with the red wine.\nMaster Pory roared with drunken laughter. \"Cup and lip missed that\ntime!\" he cried.\n\nThe man who had thrown the stone was Jeremy Sparrow. For one instant\nI saw his great figure, and the wrathful face beneath his shock of\ngrizzled hair; the next he had made his way through the crowd of gaping\nmenials and was gone.\n\nMy lord stared foolishly at the stains upon his hands, at the fallen\ngoblet and the stone beside it. \"Cogged dice,\" he said thickly, \"or\nI had not lost that throw! I'll drink that toast by myself to-morrow\nnight, when the ship does n't rock like this d--d floor, and the sea\nhas no stones to throw. More wine, Giles! To my Lord High Admiral,\ngentlemen! To his Grace of Buckingham! May he shortly howl in hell, and\nlooking back to Whitehall see me upon the King's bosom! The King 's a\ngood king, gentlemen! He gave me this ruby. D' ye know what I had of him\nlast year? I\"--\n\nI turned and left the door and the house. I could not thrust a fight\nupon a drunken man.\n\nTen yards away, suddenly and without any warning of his approach, I\nfound beside me the Indian Nantauquas. \"I have been to the woods to\nhunt,\" he said, in the slow musical English Rolfe had taught him. \"I\nknew where a panther lodged, and to-day I laid a snare, and took him\nin it. I brought him to my brother's house, and caged him there. When I\nhave tamed him, I shall give him to the beautiful lady.\"\n\nHe expected no answer, and I gave him none. There are times when an\nIndian is the best company in the world.\n\nJust before we reached the market place we had to pass the mouth of a\nnarrow lane leading down to the river. The night was very dark, though\nthe stars still shone through rifts in the ever moving clouds. The\nIndian and I walked rapidly on,--my footfalls sounding clear and sharp\non the frosty ground, he as noiseless as a shadow. We had reached the\nfurther side of the lane, when he put forth an arm and plucked from the\nblackness a small black figure.\n\nIn the middle of the square was kept burning a great brazier filled\nwith pitched wood. It was the duty of the watch to keep it flaming from\ndarkness to dawn. We found it freshly heaped with pine, and its red\nglare lit a goodly circle. The Indian, pinioning the wrists of his\ncaptive with his own hand of steel, dragged him with us into this circle\nof light.\n\n\"Looking for simples once more, learned doctor?\" I demanded.\n\nHe mowed and jabbered, twisting this way and that in the grasp of the\nIndian.\n\n\"Loose him,\" I said to the latter, \"but let him not come too near you.\nWhy, worthy doctor, in so wild and threatening a night, when fire is\nburning and wine flowing at the guest house, do you choose to crouch\nhere in the cold and darkness?\"\n\nHe looked at me with his filmy eyes, and that faint smile that had more\nof menace in it than a panther's snarl. \"I laid in wait for you, it is\ntrue, noble sir,\" he said in his thin, dreamy voice, \"but it was for\nyour good. I would give you warning, sir.\"\n\nHe stood with his mean figure bent cringingly forward, and with his hat\nin his hand. \"A warning, sir,\" he went ramblingly on. \"Maybe a certain\none has made me his enemy. Maybe I cut myself loose from his service.\nMaybe I would do him an ill turn. I can tell you a secret, sir.\" He\nlowered his voice and looked around, as if in fear of eavesdroppers.\n\n\"In your ear, sir,\" he said.\n\nI recoiled. \"Stand back,\" I cried, \"or you will cull no more simples\nthis side of hell!\"\n\n\"Hell!\" he answered. \"There's no such place. I will not tell my secret\naloud.\"\n\n\"Nicolo the Italian! Nicolo the Poisoner! Nicolo the Black Death! I am\ncoming for the soul you sold me. There is a hell!\"\n\nThe thundering voice came from underneath our feet. With a sound that\nwas not a groan and not a screech, the Italian reeled back against the\nheated iron of the brazier. Starting from that fiery contact with\nan unearthly shriek, he threw up his arms and dashed away into the\ndarkness. The sound of his madly hurrying footsteps came back to us\nuntil the guest house had swallowed him and his guilty terrors.\n\n\"Can the preacher play the devil too?\" I asked, as Sparrow came up to\nus from the other side of the fire. \"I could have sworn that that voice\ncame from the bowels of the earth. 'T is the strangest gift!\"\n\n\"A mere trick,\" he said, with his great laugh, \"but it has served me\nwell on more occasions than one. It is not known in Virginia, sir, but\nbefore ever the word of the Lord came to me to save poor silly souls\nI was a player. Once I played the King's ghost in Will Shakespeare's\n'Hamlet,' and then, I warrant you, I spoke from the cellarage indeed. I\nso frighted players and playgoers that they swore it was witchcraft, and\nBurbage's knees did knock together in dead earnest. But to the matter\nin hand. When I had thrown yonder stone, I walked quietly down to the\nGovernor's house and looked through the window. The Governor hath\nthe Company's letters, and he and the Council--all save the reprobate\nPory--sit there staring at them and drumming with their fingers on the\ntable.\"\n\n\"Is Rolfe of the Council?\" I asked.\n\n\"Ay; he was speaking,--for you, I suppose, though I heard not the words.\nThey all listened, but they all shook their heads.\"\n\n\"We shall know in the morning,\" I said. \"The night grows wilder, and\nhonest folks should be abed. Nantauquas, good-night. When will you have\ntamed your panther?\"\n\n\"It is now the moon of cohonks,\" answered the Indian. \"When the moon of\nblossoms is here, the panther shall roll at the beautiful lady's feet.\"\n\n\"The moon of blossoms!\" I said. \"The moon of blossoms is a long way off.\nI have panthers myself to tame before it comes. This wild night gives\none wild thoughts, Master Sparrow. The loud wind, and the sound of the\nwater, and the hurrying clouds--who knows if we shall ever see the moon\nof blossoms?\" I broke off with a laugh for my own weakness. \"It's not\noften that a soldier thinks of death,\" I said. \"Come to bed, reverend\nsir. Nantauquas, again, good-night, and may you tame your panther!\"\n\nIn the great room of the minister's house I paced up and down; now\npausing at the window, to look out upon the fast darkening houses of the\ntown, the ever thickening clouds, and the bending trees; now speaking to\nmy wife, who sat in the chair I had drawn for her before the fire, her\nhands idle in her lap, her head thrown back against the wood, her face\nwhite and still, with wide dark eyes. We waited for we knew not what,\nbut the light still burned in the Governor's house, and we could not\nsleep and leave it there.\n\nIt grew later and later. The wind howled down the chimney, and I heaped\nmore wood upon the fire. The town lay in darkness now; only in the\ndistance burned like an angry star the light in the Governor's house. In\nthe lull between the blasts of wind it was so very still that the sound\nof my footfalls upon the floor, the dropping of the charred wood upon\nthe hearth, the tapping of the withered vines without the window, jarred\nlike thunder.\n\nSuddenly madam leaned forward in her chair. \"There is some one at the\ndoor,\" she said.\n\nAs she spoke, the latch rose and some one pushed heavily against the\ndoor. I had drawn the bars across. \"Who is it?\" I demanded, going to it.\n\n\"It is Diccon, sir,\" replied a guarded voice outside. \"I beg of you, for\nthe lady's sake, to let me speak to you.\"\n\nI opened the door, and he crossed the threshold. I had not seen him\nsince the night he would have played the assassin. I had heard of him\nas being in Martin's Hundred, with which plantation and its turbulent\ncommander the debtor and the outlaw often found sanctuary.\n\n\"What is it, sirrah?\" I inquired sternly.\n\nHe stood with his eyes upon the floor, twirling his cap in his hands. He\nhad looked once at madam when he entered, but not at me. When he spoke\nthere was the old bravado in his voice, and he threw up his head with\nthe old reckless gesture. \"Though I am no longer your man, sir,\" he\nsaid, \"yet I hope that one Christian may warn another. The marshal, with\na dozen men at his heels, will be here anon.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\"\n\n\"Why, I was in the shadow by the Governor's window when the parson\nplayed eavesdropper. When he was gone I drew myself up to the ledge, and\nwith my knife made a hole in the shutter that fitted my ear well enough.\nThe Governor and the Council sat there, with the Company's letters\nspread upon the table. I heard the letters read. Sir George Yeardley's\npetition to be released from the governorship of Virginia is granted,\nbut he will remain in office until the new Governor, Sir Francis Wyatt,\ncan arrive in Virginia. The Company is out of favor. The King hath sent\nSir Edwyn Sandys to the Tower. My Lord Warwick waxeth greater every day.\nThe very life of the Company dependeth upon the pleasure of the King,\nand it may not defy him. You are to be taken into custody within six\nhours of the reading of the letter, to be kept straitly until the\nsailing of the Santa Teresa, and to be sent home aboard of her in irons.\nThe lady is to go also, with all honor, and with women to attend her.\nUpon reaching London, you are to be sent to the Tower, the lady to\nWhitehall. The Court of High Commission will take the matter under\nconsideration at once. My Lord of Southampton writes that, because of\nthe urgent entreaty of Sir George Yeardley, he will do for you all that\nlieth in his power, but that if you prove not yourself conformable,\nthere will be little that any can do.\"\n\n\"When will the marshal be here?\" I demanded.\n\n\"Directly. The Governor was sending for him when I left the window.\nMaster Rolfe spoke vehemently for you, and would have left the Council\nto come to you; but the Governor, swearing that the Company should not\nbe betrayed by its officers, constrained him to remain. I'm not the\nCompany's officer, so I may tell its orders if I please. A masterless\nman may speak without fear or favor. I have told you all I know.\" Before\nI could speak he was gone, closing the door heavily behind him.\n\nI turned to the King's ward. She had risen from the chair, and now stood\nin the centre of the room, one hand at her bosom, the other clenched at\nher side, her head thrown up. She looked as she had looked at Weyanoke,\nthat first night.\n\n\"Madam,\" I said under my breath.\n\nShe turned her face upon me. \"Did you think,\" she asked in a low,\neven voice,--\"did you think that I would ever set my foot upon that\nship,--that ship on the river there? One ship brought me here upon\na shameful errand; another shall not take me upon one more shameful\nstill.\"\n\nShe took her hand from her bosom; in it gleamed in the firelight the\nsmall dagger I had given her that night. She laid it on the table, but\nkept her hand upon it. \"You will choose for me, sir,\" she declared.\n\nI went to the door and looked out. \"It is a wild night,\" I said. \"I\ncan suit it with as wild an enterprise. Make a bundle of your warmest\nclothing, madam, and wrap your mantle about you. Will you take Angela?\"\n\n\"No,\" she answered. \"I will not have her peril too upon me.\"\n\nAs she stood there, her hand no longer upon the dagger, the large tears\nwelled into her eyes and fell slowly over her white cheeks. \"It is for\nmine honor, sir,\" she said. \"I know that I ask your death.\"\n\nI could not bear to see her weep, and so I spoke roughly. \"I have told\nyou before,\" I said, \"that your honor is my honor. Do you think I would\nsleep to-morrow night, in the hold of the Santa Teresa, knowing that my\nwife supped with my Lord Carnal?\"\n\nI crossed the room to take my pistols from the rack. As I passed her she\ncaught my hand in hers, and bending pressed her lips upon it. \"You have\nbeen very good to me,\" she murmured. \"Do not think me an ingrate.\"\n\nFive minutes later she came from her own room, hooded and mantled, and\nwith a packet of clothing in her hand. I extinguished the torches,\nthen opened the door. As we crossed the threshold, we paused as by one\nimpulse and looked back into the firelit warmth of the room; then I\nclosed the door softly behind us, and we went out into the night.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX IN WHICH WE HAVE UNEXPECTED COMPANY\n\n\nTHE wind, which had heretofore come in fierce blasts, was now steadying\nto a gale. What with the flying of the heaped clouds, the slanting,\ngroaning pines, and the rushing of the river, the whole earth seemed a\nfugitive, fleeing breathless to the sea. From across the neck of land\ncame the long-drawn howl of wolves, and in the wood beyond the church a\ncatamount screamed and screamed. The town before us lay as dark and as\nstill as the grave; from the garden where we were we could not see the\nGovernor's house.\n\n\"I will carry madam's bundle,\" said a voice behind us.\n\nIt was the minister who had spoken, and he now stood beside us. There\nwas a moment's silence, then I said, with a laugh: \"We are not going\nupon a summer jaunt, friend Sparrow. There is a warm fire in the great\nroom, to which your reverence had best betake yourself out of this windy\nnight.\"\n\nAs he made no movement to depart, but instead possessed himself of\nMistress Percy's bundle, I spoke again, with some impatience: \"We are no\nlonger of your fold, reverend sir, but are bound for another parish. We\ngive you hearty thanks for your hospitality, and wish you a very good\nnight.\"\n\nAs I spoke I would have taken the bundle from him, but he tucked it\nunder his arm, and, passing us, opened the garden gate. \"Did I forget to\ntell you,\" he said, \"that worthy Master Bucke is well of the fever, and\nreturns to his own to-morrow? His house and church are no longer mine. I\nhave no charge anywhere. I am free and footloose. May I not go with\nyou, madam? There may be dragons to slay, and two can guard a distressed\nprincess better than one. Will you take me for your squire, Captain\nPercy?\"\n\nHe held out his great hand, and after a moment I put my own in it.\n\nWe left the garden and struck into a lane. \"The river, then, instead of\nthe forest?\" he asked in a low voice.\n\n\"Ay,\" I answered. \"Of the two evils it seems the lesser.\"\n\n\"How about a boat?\"\n\n\"My own is fastened to the piles of the old deserted wharf.\"\n\n\"You have with you neither food nor water.\"\n\n\"Both are in the boat. I have kept her victualed for a week or more.\"\n\nHe laughed in the darkness, and I heard my wife beside me utter a\nstifled exclamation.\n\nThe lane that we were now in ran parallel to the street to within fifty\nyards of the guest house, when it bent sharply down to the river. We\nmoved silently and with caution, for some night bird might accost us\nor the watch come upon us. In the guest house all was darkness save one\nroom,--the upper room,--from which came a very pale light. When we had\nturned with the lane there were no houses to pass; only gaunt pines\nand copses of sumach. I took my wife by the hand and hurried her on. A\nhundred yards before us ran the river, dark and turbulent, and between\nus and it rose an old, unsafe, and abandoned landing. Sparrow laid his\nhand upon my arm. \"Footsteps behind us,\" he whispered.\n\nWithout slackening pace I turned my head and looked. The clouds, high\naround the horizon, were thinning overhead, and the moon, herself\ninvisible, yet lightened the darkness below. The sandy lane stretched\nbehind us like a ribbon of twilight,--nothing to be seen but it and the\nebony mass of bush and tree lining it on either side. We hastened on. A\nminute later and we heard behind us a sound like the winding of a small\nhorn, clear, shrill, and sweet. Sparrow and I wheeled--and saw nothing.\nThe trees ran down to the very edge of the wharf, upon whose rotten,\nloosened, and noisy boards we now trod. Suddenly the clouds above us\nbroke, and the moon shone forth, whitening the mountainous clouds,\nthe ridged and angry river, and the low, tree-fringed shore. Below us,\nfastened to the piles and rocking with the waves, was the open boat in\nwhich we were to embark. A few broken steps led from the boards above to\nthe water below. Descending these I sprang into the boat and held out my\narms for Mistress Percy. Sparrow gave her to me, and I lifted her down\nbeside me; then turned to give what aid I might to the minister, who was\nhalfway down the steps--and faced my Lord Carnal.\n\nWhat devil had led him forth on such a night; why he, whom with my own\neyes, three hours agone, I had seen drunken, should have chosen, after\nhis carouse, cold air and his own company rather than sleep; when and\nwhere he first spied us, how long he had followed us, I have never\nknown. Perhaps he could not sleep for triumph, had heard of my impending\narrest, had come forth to add to the bitterness of my cup by his\npresence, and so had happened upon us. He could only have guessed at\nthose he followed, until he reached the edge of the wharf and looked\ndown upon us in the moonlight. For a moment he stood without moving;\nthen he raised his hand to his lips, and the shrill call that had before\nstartled us rang out again. At the far end of the lane lights appeared.\nMen were coming down the lane at a run; whether they were the watch,\nor my lord's own rogues, we tarried not to see. There was not time to\nloosen the rope from the piles, so I drew my knife to cut it. My lord\nsaw the movement, and sprang down the steps, at the same time shouting\nto the men behind to hasten. Sparrow, grappling with him, locked him in\na giant's embrace, lifted him bodily from the steps, and flung him into\nthe boat. His head struck against a thwart, and he lay, huddled beneath\nit, quiet enough. The minister sprang after him, and I cut the rope. By\nnow the wharf shook with running feet, and the backward-streaming flame\nof the torches reddened its boards and the black water beneath; but each\ninstant the water widened between us and our pursuers. Wind and current\nswept us out, and at that wharf there were no boats to follow us.\n\nThose whom my lord's whistle had brought were now upon the very edge of\nthe wharf. The marshal's voice called upon us in the name of the King to\nreturn. Finding that we vouchsafed no answer, he pulled out a pistol and\nfired, the ball going through my hat; then whipped out its fellow and\nfired again. Mistress Percy, whose behavior had been that of an angel,\nstirred in her seat. I did not know until the day broke that the ball\nhad grazed her arm, drenching her sleeve with blood.\n\n\"It is time we were away,\" I said, with a laugh. \"If your reverence will\nkeep your hand upon the tiller and your eye upon the gentleman whom you\nhave made our traveling companion, I'll put up the sail.\"\n\nI was on my way to the foremast, when the boom lying prone before\nme rose. Slowly and majestically the sail ascended, tapering upward,\nsilvered by the moon,--the great white pinion which should bear us we\nknew not whither. I stopped short in my tracks, Mistress Percy drew a\nsobbing breath, and the minister gasped with admiration. We all three\nstared as though the white cloth had veritably been a monster wing\nendowed with life.\n\n\"Sails don't rise of themselves!\" I exclaimed, and was at the mast\nbefore the words were out of my lips. Crouched behind it was a man. I\nshould have known him even without the aid of the moon. Often enough,\nGod knows, I had seen him crouched like this beside me, ourselves in\nambush awaiting some unwary foe, brute or human; or ourselves in hiding,\nholding our breath lest it should betray us. The minister who had been a\nplayer, the rival who would have poisoned me, the servant who would\nhave stabbed me, the wife who was wife in name only,--mine were strange\nshipmates.\n\nHe rose to his feet and stood there against the mast, in the old\nhalf-submissive, half-defiant attitude, with his head thrown back in the\nold way.\n\n\"If you order me, sir, I will swim ashore,\" he said, half sullenly,\nhalf--I know not how.\n\n\"You would never reach the shore,\" I replied. \"And you know that I\nwill never order you again. Stay here if you please, or come aft if you\nplease.\"\n\nI went back and took the tiller from Sparrow. We were now in mid-river,\nand the swollen stream and the strong wind bore us on with them like a\nleaf before the gale. We left behind the lights and the clamor, the dark\ntown and the silent fort, the weary Due Return and the shipping about\nthe lower wharf. Before us loomed the Santa Teresa; we passed so close\nbeneath her huge black sides that we heard the wind whistling through\nher rigging. When she, too, was gone, the river lay bare before us;\nsilver when the moon shone, of an inky blackness when it was obscured by\none of the many flying clouds.\n\nMy wife wrapped her mantle closer about her, and, leaning back in her\nseat in the stern beside me, raised her face to the wild and solemn\nheavens. Diccon sat apart in the bow and held his tongue. The minister\nbent over, and, lifting the man that lay in the bottom of the boat, laid\nhim at full length upon the thwart before us. The moonlight streamed\ndown upon the prostrate figure. I think it could never have shone upon\na more handsome or a more wicked man. He lay there in his splendid dress\nand dark beauty, Endymion-like, beneath the moon. The King's ward turned\nher eyes upon him, kept them there a moment, then glanced away, and\nlooked at him no more.\n\n\"There's a parlous lump upon his forehead where it struck the thwart,\"\nsaid the minister, \"but the life's yet in him. He'll shame honest men\nfor many a day to come. Your Platonists, who from a goodly outside argue\nas fair a soul, could never have been acquainted with this gentleman.\"\n\nThe subject of his discourse moaned and stirred. The minister raised one\nof the hanging hands and felt for the pulse. \"Faint enough,\" he went on.\n\"A little more and the King might have waited for his minion forever\nand a day. It would have been the better for us, who have now, indeed, a\nstrange fish upon our hands, but I am glad I killed him not.\"\n\nI tossed him a flask. \"It's good aqua vitae, and the flask is honest.\nGive him to drink of it.\"\n\nHe forced the liquor between my lord's teeth, then dashed water in his\nface. Another minute and the King's favorite sat up and looked around\nhim. Dazed as yet, he stared, with no comprehension in his eyes, at\nthe clouds, the sail, the rushing water, the dark figures about him.\n\"Nicolo!\" he cried sharply.\n\n\"He's not here, my lord,\" I said.\n\nAt the sound of my voice he sprang to his feet.\n\n\"I should advise your lordship to sit still,\" I said. \"The wind is very\nboisterous, and we are not under bare poles. If you exert yourself, you\nmay capsize the boat.\"\n\nHe sat down mechanically, and put his hand to his forehead. I watched\nhim curiously. It was the strangest trick that fortune had played him.\n\nHis hand dropped at last, and he straightened himself, with a long\nbreath. \"Who threw me into the boat?\" he demanded.\n\n\"The honor was mine,\" declared the minister.\n\nThe King's minion lacked not the courage of the body, nor, when\npassionate action had brought him naught, a certain reserve force of\nphilosophy. He now did the best thing he could have done,--burst into\na roar of laughter. \"Zooks!\" he cried. \"It's as good a comedy as ever\nI saw! How's the play to end, captain? Are we to go off laughing, or\nis the end to be bloody after all? For instance, is there murder to be\ndone?\" He looked at me boldly, one hand on his hip, the other twirling\nhis mustaches.\n\n\"We are not all murderers, my lord,\" I told him. \"For the present you\nare in no danger other than that which is common to us all.\"\n\nHe looked at the clouds piling behind us, thicker and thicker, higher\nand higher, at the bending mast, at the black water swirling now and\nagain over the gunwales. \"It's enough,\" he muttered.\n\nI beckoned to Diccon, and putting the tiller into his hands went forward\nto reef the sail. When it was done and I was back in my place, my lord\nspoke again.\n\n\"Where are we going, captain?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"If you leave that sail up much longer, you will land us at the bottom\nof the river.\"\n\n\"There are worse places,\" I replied.\n\nHe left his seat, and moved, though with caution, to one nearer Mistress\nPercy. \"Are cold and storm and peril sweeter to you, lady, than warmth\nand safety, and a love that would guard you from, not run you into,\ndanger?\" he said in a whisper. \"Do you not wish this boat the Santa\nTeresa, these rude boards the velvet cushions of her state cabin, this\ndarkness her many lights, this cold her warmth, with the night shut out\nand love shut in?\"\n\nHis audacity, if it angered me, yet made me laugh. Not so with the\nKing's ward. She shrank from him until she pressed against the tiller.\nOur flight, the pursuing feet, the struggle at the wharf, her wounded\narm of which she had not told, the terror of the white sail rising as if\nby magic, the vision of the man she hated lying as one dead before her\nin the moonlight, the cold, the hurry of the night,--small wonder if\nher spirit failed her for some time. I felt her hand touch mine where\nit rested upon the tiller. \"Captain Percy,\" she murmured, with a little\nsobbing breath.\n\nI leaned across the tiller and addressed the favorite. \"My lord,\" I\nsaid, \"courtesy to prisoners is one thing, and freedom from restraint\nand license of tongue is another. Here at the stern the boat is somewhat\nheavily freighted. Your lordship will oblige me if you will go forward\nwhere there is room enough and to spare.\"\n\nHis black brows drew together. \"And what if I refuse, sir?\" he demanded\nhaughtily.\n\n\"I have rope here,\" I answered, \"and to aid me the gentleman who once\nbefore to-night, and in despite of your struggles, lifted you in his\narms like an infant. We will tie you hand and foot, and lay you in the\nbottom of the boat. If you make too much trouble, there is always the\nriver. My lord, you are not now at Whitehall. You are with desperate\nmen, outlaws who have no king, and so fear no king's minions. Will you\ngo free, or will you go bound? Go you shall, one way or the other.\"\n\nHe looked at me with rage and hatred in his face. Then, with a laugh\nthat was not good to hear and a shrug of the shoulders, he went forward\nto bear Diccon company in the bow.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX IN WHICH WE ARE IN DESPERATE CASE\n\n\n\"GOD walketh upon the sea as he walketh upon the land,\" said the\nminister. \"The sea is his and we are his. He will do what it liketh\nhim with his own.\" As he spoke he looked with a steadfast soul into the\nblack hollow of the wave that combed above us, threatening destruction.\n\nThe wave broke, and the boat still lived. Borne high upon the shoulder\nof the next rolling hill, we looked north, south, east, and west, and\nsaw only a waste of livid, ever forming, ever breaking waves, a gray\nsky streaked with darker gray shifting vapor, and a horizon impenetrably\nveiled. Where we were in the great bay, in what direction we were being\ndriven, how near we might be to the open sea or to some fatal shore, we\nknew not. What we did know was that both masts were gone, that we must\nbail the boat without ceasing if we would keep it from swamping, that\nthe wind was doing an apparently impossible thing and rising higher and\nhigher, and that the waves which buffeted us from one to the other were\nhourly swelling to a more monstrous bulk.\n\nWe had come into the wider waters at dawn, and still under canvas. An\nhour later, off Point Comfort, a bare mast contented us; we had hardly\ngotten the sail in when mast and all went overboard. That had been hours\nago.\n\nA common peril is a mighty leveler of barriers. Scant time was there\nin that boat to make distinction between friend and foe. As one man\nwe fought the element which would devour us. Each took his turn at\nthe bailing, each watched for the next great wave before which we must\ncower, clinging with numbed hands to gunwale and thwart. We fared alike,\ntoiled alike, and suffered alike, only that the minister and I cared for\nMistress Percy, asking no help from the others.\n\nThe King's ward endured all without a murmur. She was cold, she was worn\nwith watching and terror, she was wounded; each moment Death raised his\narm to strike, but she sat there dauntless, and looked him in the face\nwith a smile upon her own. If, wearied out, we had given up the fight,\nher look would have spurred us on to wrestle with our fate to the last\ngasp. She sat between Sparrow and me, and as best we might we shielded\nher from the drenching seas and the icy wind. Morning had shown me the\nblood upon her sleeve, and I had cut away the cloth from the white arm,\nand had washed the wound with wine and bound it up. If for my fee, I\nshould have liked to press my lips upon the blue-veined marble, still I\ndid it not.\n\nWhen, a week before, I had stored the boat with food and drink and had\nbrought it to that lonely wharf, I had thought that if at the last my\nwife willed to flee I would attempt to reach the bay, and passing out\nbetween the capes would go to the north. Given an open boat and the\ntempestuous seas of November, there might be one chance out of a hundred\nof our reaching Manhattan and the Dutch, who might or might not give us\nrefuge. She had willed to flee, and we were upon our journey, and the\none chance had vanished. That wan, monotonous, cold, and clinging mist\nhad shrouded us for our burial, and our grave yawned beneath us.\n\nThe day passed and the night came, and still we fought the sea, and\nstill the wind drove us whither it would. The night passed and the\nsecond morning came, and found us yet alive. My wife lay now at my feet,\nher head pillowed upon the bundle she had brought from the minister's\nhouse. Too weak for speech, waiting in pain and cold and terror for\ndeath to bring her warmth and life, the knightly spirit yet lived in her\neyes, and she smiled when I bent over her with wine to moisten her lips.\nAt length she began to wander in her mind, and to speak of summer days\nand flowers. A hand held my heart in a slowly tightening grip of iron,\nand the tears ran down the minister's cheeks. The man who had darkened\nher young life, bringing her to this, looked at her with an ashen face.\n\nAs the day wore on, the gray of the sky paled to a dead man's hue and\nthe wind lessened, but the waves were still mountain high. One moment\nwe poised, like the gulls that now screamed about us, upon some giddy\nsummit, the sky alone above and around us; the next we sank into dark\ngreen and glassy caverns. Suddenly the wind fell away, veered, and rose\nagain like a giant refreshed.\n\nDiccon started, put his hand to his ear, then sprang to his feet.\n\"Breakers!\" he cried hoarsely.\n\nWe listened with straining ears. He was right. The low, ominous murmur\nchanged to a distant roar, grew louder yet, and yet louder, and was no\nlonger distant.\n\n\"It will be the sand islets off Cape Charles, sir,\" he said. I nodded.\nHe and I knew there was no need of words.\n\nThe sky grew paler and paler, and soon upon the woof of the clouds\na splash of dull yellow showed where the sun would be. The fog rose,\nlaying bare the desolate ocean. Before us were two very small islands,\nmere handfuls of sand, lying side by side, and encompassed half by the\nopen sea, half by stiller waters diked in by marshes and sand bars. A\ncoarse, scanty grass and a few stunted trees with branches bending away\nfrom the sea lived upon them, but nothing else. Over them and over the\nmarshes and the sand banks circled myriads of great white gulls. Their\nharsh, unearthly voices came to us faintly, and increased the desolation\nof earth and sky and sea.\n\nTo the shell-strewn beach of the outer of the two islets raced long\nlines of surf, and between us and it lurked a sand bar, against which\nthe great rollers dashed with a bull-like roar. The wind drove us\nstraight upon this bar. A moment of deadly peril and it had us fast,\nholding us for the waves to beat our life out. The boat listed, then\nrested, quivering through all its length. The waves pounded against its\nside, each watery battering-ram dissolving in foam and spray but to give\nplace to another, and yet it held together, and yet we lived. How long\nit would hold we could not tell; we only knew it could not be for long.\nThe inclination of the boat was not so great but that, with caution, we\nmight move about. There were on board rope and an axe. With the latter I\ncut away the thwarts and the decking in the bow, and Diccon and I made\na small raft. When it was finished, I lifted my wife in my arms and laid\nher upon it and lashed her to it with the rope. She smiled like a child,\nthen closed her eyes. \"I have gathered primroses until I am tired,\" she\nsaid. \"I will sleep here a little in the sunshine, and when I awake I\nwill make you a cowslip ball.\"\n\nTime passed, and the groaning, trembling timbers still held together.\nThe wind fell, the sky became blue, and the sun shone. Another while,\nand the waves were less mountainous and beat less furiously against the\nboat. Hope brightened before us. To strong swimmers the distance to the\nislet was trifling; if the boat would but last until the sea subsided,\nwe might gain the beach. What we would do upon that barren spot, where\nwas neither man nor brute, food nor water, was a thing that we had not\nthe time to consider. It was land that we craved.\n\nAnother hour, and the sea still fell. Another, and a wave struck the\nboat with force. \"The sea is coming in!\" cried the minister.\n\n\"Ay,\" I answered. \"She will go to pieces now.\"\n\nThe minister rose to his feet. \"I am no mariner,\" he said, \"but once\nin the water I can swim you like any fish. There have been times when I\nhave reproached the Lord for that he cased a poor silly humble preacher\nlike me with the strength and seeming of some might man of old, and\nthere have been times when I have thanked him for that strength. I thank\nhim now. Captain Percy, if you will trust the lady to me, I will take\nher safely to that shore.\"\n\nI raised my head from the figure over which I was bending, and looked\nfirst at the still tumultuous sea, and then at the gigantic frame of the\nminister. When we had made that frail raft no swimmer could have lived\nin that shock of waves; now there was a chance for all, and for the\nminister, with his great strength, the greatest I have ever seen in any\nman, a double chance. I took her from the raft and gave her into his\narms. A minute later the boat went to pieces.\n\nSide by side Sparrow and I buffeted the sea. He held the King's ward\nin one arm, and he bore her safely over the huge swells and through the\nonslaught of the breaking waves. I could thank God for his strength, and\ntrust her to it. For the other three of us, we were all strong swimmers,\nand though bruised and beat about, we held our own. Each wave, overcome,\nleft us nearer the islet,--a little while and our feet touched bottom.\nA short struggle with the tremendous surf and we were out of the maw of\nthe sea, but out upon a desolate islet, a mere hand's-breadth of sand\nand shell in a lonely ocean, some three leagues from the mainland of\nAccomac, and upon it neither food nor water. We had the clothes upon our\nbacks, and my lord and I had kept our swords. I had a knife, and Diccon\ntoo was probably armed. The flint and steel and tinder box within my\npouch made up our store.\n\nThe minister laid the woman whom he carried upon the pebbles, fell upon\nhis knees, and lifted his rugged face to heaven. I too knelt, and with\nmy hand upon her heart said my own prayer in my own way. My lord stood\nwith unbent head, his eyes upon that still white face, but Diccon turned\nabruptly and strode off to a low ridge of sand, from the top of which\none might survey the entire island.\n\nIn two minutes he was back again. \"There's plenty of driftwood further\nup the beach,\" he announced, \"and a mort of dried seaweed. At least we\nneed n't freeze.\"\n\nThe great bonfire that we made roared and crackled, sending out a most\ncheerful heat and light. Under that genial breath the color came\nslowly back to madam's cheek and lip, and her heart beat more strongly.\nPresently she turned under my hand, and with a sigh pillowed her head\nupon her arm and went to sleep in that blessed warmth like a little\nchild.\n\nWe who had no mind for sleep sat there beside the fire and watched the\nsun sink behind the low black line of the mainland, now plainly visible\nin the cleared air. It dyed the waves blood red, and shot out one long\nray to crimson a single floating cloud, no larger than a man's hand,\nhigh in the blue. Sea birds, a countless multitude, went to and fro with\nharsh cries from island to marsh, and marsh to island. The marshes were\nstill green; they lay, a half moon of fantastic shapes, each parted from\nthe other by pink water. Beyond them was the inlet dividing us from\nthe mainland, and that inlet was three leagues in width. We turned and\nlooked seaward. Naught but leaping waves white-capped to the horizon.\n\n\"We touched here the time we went against the French at Port Royal and\nSt. Croix,\" I said. \"We had heard a rumor that the Bermuda pirates had\nhidden gold here. Argall and I went over every foot of it.\"\n\n\"And found no water?\" questioned the minister.\n\n\"And found no water.\"\n\nThe light died from the west and from the sea beneath, and the night\nfell. When with the darkness the sea fowl ceased their clamor, a\ndreadful silence suddenly enfolded us. The rush of the surf made no\ndifference; the ear heard it, but to the mind there was no sound. The\nsky was thick with stars; every moment one shot, and the trail of white\nfire it left behind melted into the night silently like snowflakes.\nThere was no wind. The moon rose out of the sea, and lent the sandy isle\nher own pallor. Here and there, back amongst the dunes, the branches of\na low and leafless tree writhed upward like dark fingers thrust from out\nthe spectral earth. The ocean, quiet now, dreamed beneath the moon and\ncared not for the five lives it had cast upon that span of sand.\n\nWe piled driftwood and tangles of seaweed upon our fire, and it flamed\nand roared and broke the silence. Diccon, going to the landward side of\nthe islet, found some oysters, which we roasted and ate; but we had nor\nwine nor water with which to wash them down.\n\n\"At least there are here no foes to fear,\" quoth my lord. \"We may all\nsleep to-night; and zooks! we shall need it!\" He spoke frankly, with an\nopen face.\n\n\"I will take one watch, if you will take the other,\" I said to the\nminister.\n\nHe nodded. \"I will watch until midnight.\"\n\nIt was long past that time when he roused me from where I lay at\nMistress Percy's feet.\n\n\"I should have relieved you long ago,\" I told him.\n\nHe smiled. The moon, now high in the heavens, shone upon and softened\nhis rugged features. I thought I had never seen a face so filled with\ntenderness and hope and a sort of patient power. \"I have been with God,\"\nhe said simply. \"The starry skies and the great ocean and the little\nshells beneath my hand,--how wonderful are thy works, O Lord! What is\nman that thou art mindful of him? And yet not a sparrow falleth\"--I rose\nand sat by the fire, and he laid himself down upon the sand beside me.\n\n\"Master Sparrow,\" I asked, \"have you ever suffered thirst?\"\n\n\"No,\" he answered. We spoke in low tones, lest we should wake her.\nDiccon and my lord, upon the other side of the fire, were sleeping\nheavily.\n\n\"I have,\" I said. \"Once I lay upon a field of battle throughout a summer\nday, sore wounded and with my dead horse across my body. I shall forget\nthe horror of that lost field and the torment of that weight before I\nforget the thirst.\"\n\n\"You think there is no hope?\"\n\n\"What hope should there be?\"\n\nHe was silent. Presently he turned and looked at the King's ward where\nshe lay in the rosy light; then his eyes came back to mine.\n\n\"If it comes to the worst I shall put her out of her torment,\" I said.\n\nHe bowed his head and we sat in silence, our gaze upon the ground\nbetween us, listening to the low thunder of the surf and the crackling\nof the fire. \"I love her,\" I said at last. \"God help me!\"\n\nHe put his finger to his lips. She had stirred and opened her eyes. I\nknelt beside her, and asked her how she did and if she wanted aught.\n\n\"It is warm,\" she said wonderingly.\n\n\"You are no longer in the boat,\" I told her. \"You are safe upon the\nland. You have been sleeping here by the fire that we kindled.\"\n\nAn exquisite smile just lit her face, and her eyelids drooped again.\n\"I am so tired,\" she said drowsily, \"that I will sleep a little longer.\nWill you bring me some water, Captain Percy? I am very thirsty.\"\n\nAfter a moment I said gently, \"I will go get it, madam.\" She made no\nanswer; she was already asleep. Nor did Sparrow and I speak again. He\nlaid himself down with his face to the ocean, and I sat with my head in\nmy hands, and thought and thought, to no purpose.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI IN WHICH A GRAVE IS DIGGED\n\n\nWHEN the stars had gone out and the moon begun to pale, I raised my face\nfrom my hands. Only a few glowing embers remained of the fire, and the\ndriftwood that we had collected was exhausted. I thought that I would\ngather more, and build up the fire against the time when the others\nshould awake. The driftwood lay in greatest quantity some distance up\nthe beach, against a low ridge of sand dunes. Beyond these the islet\ntapered off to a long gray point of sand and shell. Walking toward this\npoint in the first pale light of dawn, I chanced to raise my eyes, and\nbeheld riding at anchor beyond the spit of sand a ship.\n\nI stopped short and rubbed my eyes. She lay there on the sleeping ocean\nlike a dream ship, her masts and rigging black against the pallid sky,\nthe mist that rested upon the sea enfolding half her hull. She might\nhave been of three hundred tons burthen; she was black and two-decked,\nand very high at poop and forecastle, and she was heavily armed. My eyes\ntraveled from the ship to the shore, and there dragged up on the point,\nthe oars within it, was a boat.\n\nAt the head of the beach, beyond the line of shell and weed, the sand\nlay piled in heaps. With these friendly hillocks between me and the sea,\nI crept on as silently as I might, until I reached a point just above\nthe boat. Here I first heard voices. I went a little further, then\nknelt, and, parting the long coarse grass that filled the hollow between\ntwo hillocks, looked out upon two men who were digging a grave.\n\nThey dug in a furious hurry, throwing the sand to left and right, and\ncursing as they dug. They were powerful men, of a most villainous cast\nof countenance, and dressed very oddly. One with a shirt of coarsest\ndowlas, and a filthy rag tying up a broken head, yet wore velvet\nbreeches, and wiped the sweat from his face with a wrought handkerchief;\nthe other topped a suit of shreds and patches with a fine bushy ruff,\nand swung from one ragged shoulder a cloak of grogram lined with\ntaffeta. On the ground, to one side of them, lay something long and\nwrapped in white.\n\nAs they dug and cursed, the light strengthened. The east changed from\ngray to pale rose, from rose to a splendid crimson shot with gold. The\nmist lifted and the sea burned red. Two boats were lowered from the\nship, and came swiftly toward the point.\n\n\"Here they are at last,\" growled the gravedigger with the broken head\nand velvet breeches.\n\n\"They've taken their time,\" snarled his companion, \"and us two here\non this d-d island with a dead man the whole ghost's hour. Boarding a\nship's nothing, but to dig a grave on the land before cockcrow, with the\nman you're to put in it looking at you! Why could n't he be buried at\nsea, decent and respectable, like other folk?\"\n\n\"It was his will,--that's all I know,\" said the first; \"just as it was\nhis will, when he found he was a dying man, to come booming away from\nthe gold seas up here to a land where there is n't no gold, and never\nwill be. Belike he thought he'd find waiting for him at the bottom of\nthe sea, all along from the Lucayas to Cartagena, the many he sent\nthere afore he died. And Captain Paradise, he says, says he: 'It's ill\ncrossing a dead man. We'll obey him this once more'\"--\n\n\"Captain Paradise!\" cried he of the ruff. \"Who made him captain?--curse\nhim!\"\n\nHis fellow straightened himself with a jerk. \"Who made him captain? The\nship will make him captain. Who else should be captain?\"\n\n\"Red Gil!\"\n\n\"Red Gil!\" exclaimed the other. \"I'd rather have the Spaniard!\"\n\n\"The Spaniard would do well enough, if the rest of us were n't English.\nIf hating every other Spaniard would do it, he'd be English fast\nenough.\"\n\nThe scoundrel with the broken head burst into a loud laugh. \"D' ye\nremember the bark we took off Porto Bello, with the priests aboard? Oho!\nOho!\"\n\nThe rogue with the ruff grinned. \"I reckon the padres remember it, and\nfind hell easy lying. This hole's deep enough, I'm thinking.\"\n\nThey both clambered out, and one squatted at the head of the grave and\nmopped his face with his delicate handkerchief, while the other swung\nhis fine cloak with an air and dug his bare toes in the sand.\n\nThe two boats now grated upon the beach, and several of their occupants,\nspringing out, dragged them up on the sand.\n\n\"We'll never get another like him that's gone,\" said the worthy at the\nhead of the grave, gloomily regarding the something wrapped in white.\n\n\"That's gospel truth,\" assented the other, with a prodigious sigh. \"He\nwas a man what was a man. He never stuck at nothing. Don or priest, man\nor woman, good red gold or dirty silver,--it was all one to him. But\nhe's dead and gone!\"\n\n\"Now, if we had a captain like Kirby,\" suggested the first.\n\n\"Kirby keeps to the Summer Isles,\" said the second. \"'T is n't often now\nthat he swoops down as far as the Indies.\"\n\nThe man with the broken head laughed. \"When he does, there's a noise in\nthat part of the world.\"\n\n\"And that's gospel truth, too,\" swore the other, with an oath of\nadmiration.\n\nBy this the score or more who had come in the two boats were halfway\nup the beach. In front, side by side, as each conceding no inch of\nleadership, walked three men: a large man, with a villainous face much\nscarred, and a huge, bushy, dark red beard; a tall dark man, with a thin\nfierce face and bloodshot eyes, the Spaniard by his looks; and a slight\nman, with the face and bearing of an English gentleman. The men behind\nthem differed no whit from the two gravediggers, being as scoundrelly of\nface, as great of strength, and as curiously attired. They came straight\nto the open grave, and the dead man beside it. The three who seemed of\nmost importance disposed themselves, still side by side, at the head of\nthe grave, and their following took the foot.\n\n\"It's a dirty piece of work,\" said Red Gil in a voice like a raven's,\n\"and the sooner it's done with, and we are aboard again and booming back\nto the Indies, the better I'll like it. Over with him, brave boys!\"\n\n\"Is it yours to give the word?\" asked the slight man, who was dressed\npoint-device, and with a finical nicety, in black and silver. His voice\nwas low and clear, and of a somewhat melancholy cadence, going well with\nthe pensiveness of fine, deeply fringed eyes.\n\n\"Why should n't I give the word?\" growled the personage addressed,\nadding with an oath, \"I've as good a right to give it as any man,--maybe\na better right!\"\n\n\"That would be scanned,\" said he of the pensive eyes. \"Gentlemen, we\nhave here the pick of the ship. For the captain that these choose, those\non board will throw up their caps. Let us bury the dead, and then let\nchoice be made of one of us three, each of whom has claims that might\nbe put forward\"--He broke off and picking up a delicate shell began\nto study its pearly spirals with a tender, thoughtful, half-pleased,\nhalf-melancholy countenance.\n\nThe gravedigger with the wrought handkerchief looked from him to\nthe rascal crew massed at the foot of the grave, and, seeing his own\nsentiments mirrored in the countenances of not a few, snatched the\nbloody clout from his head, waved it, and cried out, \"Paradise!\"\nWhereupon arose a great confusion. Some bawled for Paradise, some for\nRed Gil, a few for the Spaniard. The two gravediggers locked horns, and\na brawny devil with a woman's mantle swathed about his naked shoulders\ndrew a knife, and made for a partisan of the Spaniard, who in his turn\nskillfully interposed between himself and the attack the body of a\nbawling well-wisher to Red Gil.\n\nThe man in black and silver tossed aside the shell, rose, and entered\nthe lists. With one hand he seized the gravedigger of the ruff, and\nhurled him apart from him of the velvet breeches; with the other he\npresented a dagger with a jeweled haft at the breast of the ruffian with\nthe woman's mantle, while in tones that would have befitted Astrophel\nplaining of his love to rocks, woods, and streams, he poured forth a\nflood of wild, singular, and filthy oaths, such as would have disgraced\na camp follower. His interference was effectual. The combatants\nfell apart and the clamor was stilled, whereupon the gentleman of\ncontrarieties at once resumed the gentle and indifferent melancholy of\nmanner and address.\n\n\"Let us off with the old love before we are on with the new, gentlemen,\"\nhe said. \"We'll bury the dead first, and choose his successor\nafterward,--decently and in order, I trust, and with due submission to\nthe majority.\"\n\n\"I'll fight for my rights,\" growled Red Gil.\n\n\"And I for mine,\" cried the Spaniard.\n\n\"And each of us'll back his own man,\" muttered in an aside the\ngravedigger with the broken head.\n\nThe one they called Paradise sighed. \"It is a thousand pities that there\nis not amongst us some one of merit so preeminent that faction should\nhide its head before it. But to the work in hand, gentlemen.\"\n\nThey gathered closer around the yawning grave, and some began to lift\nthe corpse. As for me, I withdrew as noiselessly as an Indian from my\nlair of grass, and, hidden by the heaped-up sand, made off across the\npoint and down the beach to where a light curl of smoke showed that\nsome one was mending the fire I had neglected. It was Sparrow, who\nalternately threw on driftwood and seaweed and spoke to madam, who\nsat at his feet in the blended warmth of fire and sunshine. Diccon was\nroasting the remainder of the oysters he had gathered the night before,\nand my lord stood and stared with a frowning face at the nine-mile\ndistant mainland. All turned their eyes upon me as I came up to the\nfire.\n\n\"A little longer, Captain Percy, and we would have had out a search\nwarrant,\" began the minister cheerfully. \"Have you been building a\nbridge?\"\n\n\"If I build one,\" I said, \"it will be a perilous one enough. Have you\nlooked seaward?\"\n\n\"We waked but a minute agone,\" he answered. As he spoke, he straightened\nhis great form and lifted his face from the fire to the blue sea.\nDiccon, still on his knees at his task, looked too; and my lord, turning\nfrom his contemplation of the distant kingdom of Accomac; and Mistress\nPercy, one hand shading her eyes, the slender fingers of the other still\nimmeshed in her long dark hair which she had been braiding. They stared\nat the ship in silence until my lord laughed.\n\n\"Conjure us on board at once, captain,\" he cried. \"We are thirsty.\"\n\nI drew the minister aside. \"I am going up the beach, beyond that point,\nagain; you will one and all stay here. If I do not come back, do\nthe best you can, and sell her life as dearly as you can. If I come\nback,--you are quick of wit and have been a player; look that you take\nthe cue I give you!\"\n\nI returned to the fire, and he followed me, amazement in his face. \"My\nLord Carnal,\" I said, \"I must ask you for your sword.\"\n\nHe started, and his black brows drew together. \"Though the fortunes of\nwar have made me in some sort your captive, sir,\" he said at last, and\nnot without dignity, \"I do not see, upon this isle to which we are\nall prisoners, the need of so strong testimony to the abjectness of my\ncondition, nor deem it generous\"--\n\n\"We will speak of generosity another day, my lord,\" I interrupted. \"At\npresent I am in a hurry. That you are my prisoner in verity is enough\nfor me, but not for others. I must have you so in seeming as well as in\ntruth. Moreover, Master Sparrow is weaponless, and I must needs disarm\nan enemy to arm a friend. I beg that you will give what else we must\ntake.\"\n\nHe looked at Diccon, but Diccon stood with his face to the sea. I\nthought we were to have a struggle, and I was sorry for it, but my\nlord could and did add discretion to a valor that I never doubted.\nHe shrugged his shoulders, burst into a laugh, and turned to Mistress\nPercy.\n\n\"What can one do, lady, when one is doubly a prisoner, prisoner to\nnumbers and to beauty? E'en laugh at fate, and make the best of a bad\njob. Here, sir! Some day it shall be the point!\"\n\nHe drew his rapier from its sheath, and presented the hilt to me. I took\nit with a bow, and handed it to Sparrow.\n\nThe King's ward had risen, and now leant against the bank of sand,\nher long dark hair, half braided, drawn over either shoulder, her face\nmarble white between the waves of darkness.\n\n\"I do not know that I shall ever come back,\" I said, stopping before\nher. \"May I kiss your hand before I go?\"\n\nHer lips moved, but she did not speak. I knelt and kissed her clasped\nhands. They were cold to my lips. \"Where are you going?\" she whispered.\n\"Into what danger are you going? I--I--take me with you!\"\n\nI rose, with a laugh at my own folly that could have rested brow and\nlips on those hands, and let the world wag. \"Another time,\" I said.\n\"Rest in the sunshine now, and think that all is well. All will be well,\nI trust.\"\n\nA few minutes later saw me almost upon the party gathered about the\ngrave. The grave had received that which it was to hold until the\ncrack of doom, and was now being rapidly filled with sand. The crew of\ndeep-dyed villains worked or stood or sat in silence, but all looked\nat the grave, and saw me not. As the last handful of sand made it level\nwith the beach, I walked into their midst, and found myself face to face\nwith the three candidates for the now vacant captaincy.\n\n\"Give you good-day, gentlemen,\" I cried. \"Is it your captain that you\nbury or one of your crew, or is it only pezos and pieces of eight?\"\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII IN WHICH I CHANGE MY NAME AND OCCUPATION\n\n\n\n\"THE sun shining on so much bare steel hurts my eyes,\" I said. \"Put\nup, gentlemen, put up! Cannot one rover attend the funeral of another\nwithout all this crowding and display of cutlery? If you will take the\ntrouble to look around you, you will see that I have brought to the\nobsequies only myself.\"\n\nOne by one cutlass and sword were lowered, and those who had drawn them,\nfalling somewhat back, spat and swore and laughed. The man in black and\nsilver only smiled gently and sadly. \"Did you drop from the blue?\" he\nasked. \"Or did you come up from the sea?\"\n\n\"I came out of it,\" I said. \"My ship went down in the storm yesterday.\nYour little cockboat yonder was more fortunate.\" I waved my hand toward\nthat ship of three hundred tons, then twirled my mustaches and stood at\ngaze.\n\n\"Was your ship so large, then?\" demanded Paradise, while a murmur of\nadmiration, larded with oaths, ran around the circle.\n\n\"She was a very great galleon,\" I replied, with a sigh for the good ship\nthat was gone.\n\nA moment's silence, during which they all looked at me. \"A galleon,\"\nthen said Paradise softly.\n\n\"They that sailed her yesterday are to-day at the bottom of the sea,\" I\ncontinued. \"Alackaday! so are one hundred thousand pezos of gold, three\nthousand bars of silver, ten frails of pearls, jewels uncounted, cloth\nof gold and cloth of silver. She was a very rich prize.\"\n\nThe circle sucked in their breath. \"All at the bottom of the sea?\"\nqueried Red Gil, with gloating eyes fixed upon the smiling water. \"Not\none pezo left, not one little, little pearl?\"\n\nI shook my head and heaved a prodigious sigh. \"The treasure is gone,\"\nI said, \"and the men with whom I took it are gone. I am a captain with\nneither ship nor crew. I take you, my friends, for a ship and crew\nwithout a captain. The inference is obvious.\"\n\nThe ring gaped with wonder, then strange oaths arose. Red Gil broke into\na bellow of angry laughter, while the Spaniard glared like a catamount\nabout to spring. \"So you would be our captain?\" said Paradise, picking\nup another shell, and poising it upon a hand as fine and small as a\nwoman's.\n\n\"Faith, you might go farther and fare worse,\" I answered, and began to\nhum a tune. When I had finished it, \"I am Kirby,\" I said, and waited to\nsee if that shot should go wide or through the hull.\n\nFor two minutes the dash of the surf and the cries of the wheeling sea\nfowl made the only sound in that part of the world; then from those\nhalf-clad rapscallions arose a shout of \"Kirby!\"--a shout in which the\nthree leaders did not join. That one who looked a gentleman rose from\nthe sand and made me a low bow. \"Well met, noble captain,\" he cried in\nthose his honey tones. \"You will doubtless remember me who was with you\nthat time at Maracaibo when you sunk the galleasses. Five years have\npassed since then, and yet I see you ten years younger and three inches\ntaller.\"\n\n\"I touched once at the Lucayas, and found the spring de Leon sought,\"\nI said. \"Sure the waters have a marvelous effect, and if they give not\neternal youth at least renew that which we have lost.\"\n\n\"Truly a potent aqua vitae,\" he remarked, still with thoughtful\nmelancholy. \"I see that it hath changed your eyes from black to gray.\"\n\n\"It hath that peculiar virtue,\" I said, \"that it can make black seem\nwhite.\"\n\nThe man with the woman's mantle drawn about him now thrust himself from\nthe rear to the front rank. \"That's not Kirby!\" he bawled. \"He's no more\nKirby than I am Kirby! Did n't I sail with Kirby from the Summer Isles\nto Cartagena and back again? He's a cheat, and I am agoing to cut his\nheart out!\" He was making at me with a long knife, when I whipped out my\nrapier.\n\n\"Am I not Kirby, you dog?\" I cried, and ran him through the shoulder.\n\nHe dropped, and his fellows surged forward with a yell. \"Yet a little\npatience, my masters!\" said Paradise in a raised voice and with genuine\namusement in his eyes. \"It is true that that Kirby with whom I and our\nfriend there on the ground sailed was somewhat short and as swart as a\nraven, besides having a cut across his face that had taken away a part\nof his lip and the top of his ear, and that this gentleman who announces\nhimself as Kirby hath none of Kirby's marks. But we are fair and\ngenerous and open to conviction\"--\n\n\"He'll have to convince my cutlass!\" roared Red Gil.\n\nI turned upon him. \"If I do convince it, what then?\" I demanded. \"If I\nconvince your sword, you of Spain, and yours, Sir Black and Silver?\"\n\nThe Spaniard stared. \"I was the best sword in Lima,\" he said stiffly. \"I\nand my Toledo will not change our minds.\"\n\n\"Let him try to convince Paradise; he's got no reputation as a\nswordsman!\" cried out the gravedigger with the broken head.\n\nA roar of laughter followed this suggestion, and I gathered from it\nand from the oaths and allusions to this or that time and place that\nParadise was not without reputation.\n\nI turned to him. \"If I fight you three, one by one, and win, am I\nKirby?\"\n\nHe regarded the shell with which he was toying with a thoughtful smile,\nheld it up that the light might strike through its rose and pearl, then\ncrushed it to dust between his fingers.\n\n\"Ay,\" he said with an oath. \"If you win against the cutlass of Red Gil,\nthe best blade of Lima, and the sword of Paradise, you may call yourself\nthe devil an you please, and we will all subscribe to it.\"\n\nI lifted my hand. \"I am to have fair play?\"\n\nAs one man that crew of desperate villains swore that the odds should be\nonly three to one. By this the whole matter had presented itself to them\nas an entertainment more diverting than bullfight or bearbaiting. They\nthat follow the sea, whether honest men or black-hearted knaves, have in\ntheir composition a certain childlikeness that makes them easily turned,\neasily led, and easily pleased. The wind of their passion shifts quickly\nfrom point to point, one moment blowing a hurricane, the next sinking\nto a happy-go-lucky summer breeze. I have seen a little thing convert a\ncrew on the point of mutiny into a set of rollicking, good-natured souls\nwho--until the wind veered again--would not hurt a fly. So with these.\nThey spread themselves into a circle, squatting or kneeling or standing\nupon the white sand in the bright sunshine, their sinewy hands that\nshould have been ingrained red clasped over their knees, or, arms\nakimbo, resting upon their hips, on their scoundrel faces a broad smile,\nand in their eyes that had looked on nameless horrors a pleasurable\nexpectation as of spectators in a playhouse awaiting the entrance of the\nplayers.\n\n\"There is really no good reason why we should gratify your whim,\" said\nParadise, still amused. \"But it will serve to pass the time. We will\nfight you, one by one.\"\n\n\"And if I win?\"\n\nHe laughed. \"Then, on the honor of a gentleman, you are Kirby and our\ncaptain. If you lose, we will leave you where you stand for the gulls to\nbury.\"\n\n\"A bargain,\" I said, and drew my sword.\n\n\"I first!\" roared Red Gil. \"God's wounds! there will need no second!\"\n\nAs he spoke he swung his cutlass and made an arc of blue flame. The\nweapon became in his hands a flail, terrible to look upon, making\nlightnings and whistling in the air, but in reality not so deadly as it\nseemed. The fury of his onslaught would have beaten down the guard of\nany mere swordsman, but that I was not. A man, knowing his weakness and\ninsufficiency in many and many a thing, may yet know his strength in one\nor two and his modesty take no hurt. I was ever master of my sword, and\nit did the thing I would have it do. Moreover, as I fought I saw her as\nI had last seen her, standing against the bank of sand, her dark hair,\nhalf braided, drawn over her bosom and hanging to her knees. Her\neyes haunted me, and my lips yet felt the touch of her hand. I fought\nwell,--how well the lapsing of oaths and laughter into breathless\nsilence bore witness.\n\nThe ruffian against whom I was pitted began to draw his breath in gasps.\nHe was a scoundrel not fit to die, less fit to live, unworthy of\na gentleman's steel. I presently ran him through with as little\ncompunction and as great a desire to be quit of a dirty job as if he had\nbeen a mad dog. He fell, and a little later, while I was engaged with\nthe Spaniard, his soul went to that hell which had long gaped for it.\nTo those his companions his death was as slight a thing as would theirs\nhave been to him. In the eyes of the two remaining would-be leaders\nhe was a stumbling-block removed, and to the squatting, open-mouthed\ncommonality his taking off weighed not a feather against the solid\nentertainment I was affording them. I was now a better man than Red\nGil,--that was all.\n\nThe Spaniard was a more formidable antagonist. The best blade of Lima\nwas by no means to be despised; but Lima is a small place, and its\nblades can be numbered. The sword that for three years had been counted\nthe best in all the Low Countries was its better. But I fought fasting\nand for the second time that morning, so maybe the odds were not so\ngreat. I wounded him slightly, and presently succeeded in disarming him.\n\"Am I Kirby?\" I demanded, with my point at his breast.\n\n\"Kirby, of course, senor,\" he answered with a sour smile, his eyes upon\nthe gleaming blade.\n\nI lowered my point and we bowed to each other, after which he sat down\nupon the sand and applied himself to stanching the bleeding from his\nwound. The pirate ring gave him no attention, but stared at me instead.\nI was now a better man than the Spaniard.\n\nThe man in black and silver rose and removed his doublet, folding it\nvery carefully, inside out, that the sand might not injure the velvet,\nthen drew his rapier, looked at it lovingly, made it bend until point\nand hilt well-nigh met, and faced me with a bow.\n\n\"You have fought twice, and must be weary,\" he said. \"Will you not take\nbreath before we engage, or will your long rest afterward suffice you?\"\n\n\"I will rest aboard my ship,\" I made reply. \"And as I am in a hurry to\nbe gone we won't delay.\"\n\nOur blades had no sooner crossed than I knew that in this last encounter\nI should need every whit of my skill, all my wit, audacity, and\nstrength. I had met my equal, and he came to it fresh and I jaded. I\nclenched my teeth and prayed with all my heart; I set her face before\nme, and thought if I should fail her to what ghastly fate she might\ncome, and I fought as I had never fought before. The sound of the surf\nbecame a roar in my ears, the sunshine an intolerable blaze of light;\nthe blue above and around seemed suddenly beneath my feet as well. We\nwere fighting high in the air, and had fought thus for ages. I knew that\nhe made no thrust I did not parry, no feint I could not interpret. I\nknew that my eye was more quick to see, my brain to conceive, and my\nhand to execute than ever before; but it was as though I held that\nknowledge of some other, and I myself was far away, at Weyanoke, in the\nminister's garden, in the haunted wood, anywhere save on that barren\nislet. I heard him swear under his breath, and in the face I had set\nbefore me the eyes brightened. As if she had loved me I fought for\nher with all my powers of body and mind. He swore again, and my heart\nlaughed within me. The sea now roared less loudly, and I felt the good\nearth beneath my feet. Slowly but surely I wore him out. His breath\ncame short, the sweat stood upon his forehead, and still I deferred my\nattack. He made the thrust of a boy of fifteen, and I smiled as I put it\nby.\n\n\"Why don't you end it?\" he breathed. \"Finish and be d-d to you!\"\n\nFor answer I sent his sword flying over the nearest hillock of sand.\n\"Am I Kirby?\" I said. He fell back against the heaped-up sand and leaned\nthere, panting, with his hand to his side. \"Kirby or devil,\" he replied.\n\"Have it your own way.\"\n\nI turned to the now highly excited rabble. \"Shove the boats off, half a\ndozen of you!\" I ordered. \"Some of you others take up that carrion there\nand throw it into the sea. The gold upon it is for your pains. You there\nwith the wounded shoulder you have no great hurt. I'll salve it with ten\npieces of eight from the captain's own share, the next prize we take.\"\n\nA shout of acclamation arose that scared the sea fowl. They who so short\na time before had been ready to tear me limb from limb now with the\ngreatest apparent delight hailed me as captain. How soon they might\nrevert to their former mood was a question that I found not worth while\nto propound to myself.\n\nBy this the man in black and silver had recovered his breath and his\nequanimity. \"Have you no commission with which to honor me, noble\ncaptain?\" he asked in gently reproachful tones. \"Have you forgot how\noften you were wont to employ me in those sweet days when your eyes were\nblack?\"\n\n\"By no means, Master Paradise,\" I said courteously. \"I desire your\ncompany and that of the gentleman from Lima. You will go with me to\nbring up the rest of my party. The three gentlemen of the broken head,\nthe bushy ruff, which I protest is vastly becoming, and the wounded\nshoulder will escort us.\"\n\n\"The rest of your party?\" said Paradise softly.\n\n\"Ay,\" I answered nonchalantly. \"They are down the beach and around the\npoint warming themselves by a fire which this piled-up sand hides from\nyou. Despite the sunshine it is a biting air. Let us be going! This\nisland wearies me, and I am anxious to be on board ship and away.\"\n\n\"So small an escort scarce befits so great a captain,\" he said. \"We will\nall attend you.\" One and all started forward.\n\nI called to mind and gave utterance to all the oaths I had heard in the\nwars. \"I entertain you for my subordinate whom I command, and not who\ncommands me!\" I cried, when my memory failed me. \"As for you, you dogs,\nwho would question your captain and his doings, stay where you are, if\nyou would not be lessoned in earnest!\"\n\nSheer audacity is at times the surest steed a man can bestride. Now at\nleast it did me good service. With oaths and grunts of admiration\nthe pirates stayed where they were, and went about their business of\nlaunching the boats and stripping the body of Red Gil, while the man in\nblack and silver, the Spaniard, the two gravediggers, the knave with the\nwounded shoulder, and myself walked briskly up the beach.\n\nWith these five at my heels I strode up to the dying fire and to those\nwho had sprung to their feet at our approach. \"Sparrow,\" I said easily,\n\"luck being with us as usual, I have fallen in with a party of rovers.\nI have told them who I am,--that Kirby, to wit, whom an injurious world\ncalls the blackest pirate unhanged,--and have recounted to them how the\ngreat galleon which I took some months ago went down yesterday with all\non board, you and I with these others being the sole survivors. By dint\nof a little persuasion they have elected me their captain, and we will\ngo on board directly and set sail for the Indies, a hunting ground which\nwe never should have left. You need not look so blank; you shall be my\nmate and right hand still.\" I turned to the five who formed my escort.\n\"This, gentlemen, is my mate, Jeremy Sparrow by name, who hath a taste\nfor divinity that in no wise interferes with his taste for a galleon\nor a guarda costa. This man, Diccon Demon by name, was of my crew. The\ngentleman without a sword is my prisoner, taken by me from the last ship\nI sunk. How he, an Englishman, came to be upon a Spanish bark I have not\nfound leisure to inquire. The lady is my prisoner, also.\"\n\n\"Sure by rights she should be gaoler and hold all men's hearts in ward,\"\nsaid Paradise, with a low bow to my unfortunate captive.\n\nWhile he spoke a most remarkable transformation was going on. The\nminister's grave, rugged, and deeply lined face smoothed itself and shed\nten years at least; in the eyes that I had seen wet with noble tears a\nlaughing devil now lurked, while his strong mouth became a loose-lipped,\ndevil-may-care one. His head with its aureole of bushy, grizzled hair\nset itself jauntily upon one side, and from it and from his face and his\nwhole great frame breathed a wicked jollity quite indescribable.\n\n\"Odsbodikins, captain!\" he cried. \"Kirby's luck!--'t will pass into a\nsaw! Adzooks! and so you're captain once more, and I'm mate once more,\nand we've a ship once more, and we're off once more\n\n     sail the Spanish Main\n\n     give the Spaniard pain,\n\n     ho, bully boy, heave ho!\n\nBy 'r lakin! I'm too dry to sing. It will take all the wine of Xeres in\nthe next galleon to unparch my tongue!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII IN WHICH WE WRITE UPON THE SAND\n\n\nDAY after day the wind filled our sails and sang in the rigging, and day\nafter day we sailed through blue seas toward the magic of the south. Day\nafter day a listless and voluptuous world seemed too idle for any dream\nof wrong, and day after day we whom a strange turn of Fortune's wheel\nhad placed upon a pirate ship held our lives in our hands, and walked so\nclose with Death that at length that very intimacy did breed contempt.\nIt was not a time to think; it was a time to act, to laugh and make\nothers laugh, to bluster and brag, to estrange sword and scabbard, to\nplay one's hand with a fine unconcern, but all the time to watch, watch,\nwatch, day in and day out, every minute of every hour. That ship became\na stage, and we, the actors, should have been applauded to the echo. How\nwell we played let witness the fact that the ship came to the Indies,\nwith me for captain and the minister for mate, and with the woman that\nwas on board unharmed; nay, reverenced like a queen. The great cabin was\nhers, and the poop deck; we made for her a fantastic state with\ndoffing of hats and bowings and backward steps. We were her guard,--the\ngentlemen of the Queen,--I and my Lord Carnal, the minister and Diccon,\nand we kept between her and the rest of the ship.\n\nWe did our best, and our best was very much. When I think of the songs\nthe minister sang; of the roars of laughter that went up from the\nlounging pirates when, sitting astride one of the main-deck guns, he\nmade his voice call to them, now from the hold, now from the stern\ngallery, now from the masthead, now from the gilt sea maid upon the\nprow, I laugh too. Sometimes a space was cleared for him, and he played\nto them as to the pit at Blackfriars. They laughed and wept and swore\nwith delight,--all save the Spaniard, who was ever like a thundercloud,\nand Paradise, who only smiled like some languid, side-box lord. There\nwas wine on board, and during the long, idle days, when the wind droned\nin the rigging like a bagpipe, and there was never a cloud in the sky,\nand the galleons were still far away, the pirates gambled and drank.\nDiccon diced with them, and taught them all the oaths of a free company.\nSo much wine, and no more, should they have; when they frowned, I let\nthem see that their frowning and their half-drawn knives mattered no\ndoit to me. It was their whim--a huge jest of which they could never\nhave enough--still to make believe that they sailed under Kirby. Lest\nit should spoil the jest, and while the jest outranked all other\nentertainment, they obeyed as though I had been indeed that fierce sea\nwolf.\n\nTime passed, though it passed like a tortoise, and we came to the\nLucayas, to the outposts of the vast hunting ground of Spaniard and\npirate and buccaneer, the fringe of that zone of beauty and villainy and\nfear, and sailed slowly past the islands, looking for our prey.\n\nThe sea was blue as blue could be. Only in the morning and the evening\nit glowed blood red, or spread upon its still bosom all the gold of\nall the Indies, or became an endless mead of palest green shot with\namethyst. When night fell, it mirrored the stars, great and small, or\nwas caught in a net of gold flung across it from horizon to horizon.\nThe ship rent the net with a wake of white fire. The air was balm;\nthe islands were enchanted places, abandoned by Spaniard and Indian,\novergrown, serpent-haunted. The reef, the still water, pink or gold,\nthe gleaming beach, the green plume of the palm, the scarlet birds, the\ncataracts of bloom,--the senses swooned with the color, the steaming\nincense, the warmth, the wonder of that fantastic world. Sometimes, in\nthe crystal waters near the land, we sailed over the gardens of the sea\ngods, and, looking down, saw red and purple blooms and shadowy waving\nforests, with rainbow fish for humming birds. Once we saw below us a\nsunken ship. With how much gold she had endowed the wealthy sea, how\nmany long drowned would rise from her rotted decks when the waves gave\nup their dead, no man could tell. Away from the ship darted many-hued\nfish, gold-disked, or barred and spotted with crimson, or silver and\npurple. The dolphin and the tunny and the flying fish swam with us.\nSometimes flights of small birds came to us from the land. Sometimes the\nsea was thickly set with full-blown pale red bloom, the jellyfish that\nwas a flower to the sight and a nettle to the touch. If a storm arose,\na fury that raged and threatened, it presently swept away, and the blue\nlaughed again. When the sun sank, there arose in the east such a moon\nas might have been sole light to all the realms of faery. A beauty\nlanguorous and seductive was most absolute empress of the wonderful land\nand the wonderful sea.\n\nWe were in the hunting grounds, and men went not there to gather\nflowers. Day after day we watched for Spanish sails; for the plate\nfleets went that way, and some galleass or caravel or galleon might\nstray aside. At last, in the clear green bay of a nameless island at\nwhich we stopped for water, we found two carracks come upon the same\nerrand, took them, and with them some slight treasure in rich cloths and\ngems. A week later, in a strait between two islands like tinted clouds,\nwe fought a very great galleon from sunrise to noon, pierced her hull\nthrough and through and silenced her ordnance, then boarded her and\nfound a king's ransom in gold and silver. When the fighting had ceased\nand the treasure was ours, then we four stood side by side on the deck\nof the slowly sinking galleon, in front of our prisoners,--of the men\nwho had fought well, of the ashen priests and the trembling women.\nThose whom we faced were in high good humor: they had gold with which to\ngamble, and wine to drink, and rich clothing with which to prank their\nvillainous bodies, and prisoners with whom to make merry. When I ordered\nthe Spaniards to lower their boats, and taking with them their priests\nand women row off to one of those two islands, the weather changed.\n\nWe outlived that storm, but how I scarcely know. As Kirby would have\ndone, so did I; rating my crew like hounds, turning my point this way\nand that, daring them to come taste the red death upon it, braving it\nout like some devil who knows he is invulnerable. My lord, swinging\nthe cutlass with which he was armed, stood beside me, knee to knee, and\nDiccon cursed after me, making quarterstaff play with his long pike.\nBut it was the minister that won us through. At length they laughed, and\nParadise, standing forward, swore that such a captain and such a mate\nwere worth the lives of a thousand Spaniards. To pleasure Kirby, they\nwould depart this once from their ancient usage and let the prisoners\ngo, though it was passing strange,--it being Kirby's wont to clap\nprisoners under hatches and fire their ship above them. At the end\nof which speech the Spaniard began to rave, and sprang at me like a\ncatamount. Paradise put forth a foot and tripped him up, whereat the\npirates laughed again, and held him back when he would have come at me a\nsecond time.\n\nFrom the deck of the shattered galleon I watched her boats, with their\nheavy freight of cowering humanity, pull off toward the island. Back\nupon my own poop, the grappling irons cast loose, and a swiftly widening\nribbon of blue between us and the sinking ship, I looked at the pirates\nthronging the waist below me, and knew that the play was nearly over.\nHow many days, weeks, hours, before the lights would go out, I could not\ntell: they might burn until we took or lost another ship; the next hour\nmight see that brief tragedy consummated.\n\nI turned, and going below met Sparrow at the foot of the poop ladder.\n\n\"I have sworn at these pirates until my hair stood on end,\" he said\nruefully. \"God forgive me! And I have bent into circles three half pikes\nin demonstration of the thing that would occur to them if they tempted\nme overmuch. And I have sung them all the bloody and lascivious songs\nthat ever I knew in my unregenerate days. I have played the bravo\nand buffoon until they gaped for wonder. I have damned myself to all\neternity, I fear, but there'll be no mutiny this fair day. It may arrive\nby to-morrow, though.\"\n\n\"Likely enough,\" I said. \"Come within. I have eaten nothing since\nyesterday.\"\n\n\"I'll speak to Diccon first,\" he answered, and went on toward the\nforecastle, while I entered the state cabin. Here I found Mistress Percy\nkneeling beside the bench beneath the stern windows, her face buried in\nher outstretched arms, her dark hair shadowing her like a mantle. When\nI spoke to her she did not answer. With a sudden fear I stooped and\ntouched her clasped hands. A shudder ran through her frame, and she\nslowly raised a colorless face.\n\n\"Are you come back?\" she whispered. \"I thought you would never come\nback. I thought they had killed you. I was only praying before I killed\nmyself.\"\n\nI took her hands and wrung them apart to rouse her, she was so white and\ncold, and spoke so strangely. \"God forbid that I should die yet awhile,\nmadam!\" I said. \"When I can no longer serve you, then I shall not care\nhow soon I die.\"\n\nThe eyes with which she gazed upon me were still wide and unseeing. \"The\nguns!\" she cried, wresting her hands from mine and putting them to\nher ears. \"Oh, the guns! they shake the air. And the screams and the\ntrampling--the guns again!\"\n\nI brought her wine and made her drink it; then sat beside her, and told\nher gently, over and over again, that there was no longer thunder of the\nguns or screams or trampling. At last the long, tearless sobs ceased,\nand she rose from her knees, and let me lead her to the door of her\ncabin. There she thanked me softly, with downcast eyes and lips that\nyet trembled; then vanished from my sight, leaving me first to wonder at\nthat terror and emotion in her who seldom showed the thing she felt, and\nfinally to conclude that it was not so wonderful after all.\n\nWe sailed on,--southwards to Cuba, then north again to the Lucayas\nand the Florida straits, looking for Spanish ships and their gold. The\nlights yet burned,--now brightly, now so sunken that it seemed as though\nthe next hour they must flicker out. We, the players, flagged not in\nthat desperate masque; but we knew that, in spite of all endeavor, the\ndarkness was coming fast upon us.\n\nHad it been possible, we would have escaped from the ship, hazarding new\nfortunes on the Spanish Main, in an open boat, sans food or water.\nBut the pirates watched us very closely. They called me \"captain\" and\n\"Kirby,\" and for the jest's sake gave an exaggerated obedience, with\nlaughter and flourishes; but none the less I was their prisoner,--I and\nthose I had brought with me to that ship.\n\nAn islet, shaped like the crescent moon, rose from out the sea before\nus. We needed water, and so we felt our way between the horns of\nthe crescent into the blue crystal of a fairy harbor. One low hill,\nrose-colored from base to summit, with scarce a hint of the green world\nbelow that canopy of giant bloom, a little silver beach with wonderful\nshells upon it, the sound of a waterfall and a lazy surf,--we smelt the\nfruits and the flowers, and a longing for the land came upon us. Six\nmen were left on the ship, and all besides went ashore. Some rolled the\nwater casks toward the sound of the cascade; others plunged into the\nforest, to return laden with strange and luscious fruits, birds, guanas,\nconies,--whatever eatable thing they could lay hands upon; others\nscattered along the beach to find turtle eggs, or, if fortune favored\nthem, the turtle itself. They laughed, they sang, they swore, until the\nisle rang to their merriment. Like wanton children, they called to each\nother, to the screaming birds, to the echoing bloom-draped hill.\n\nI spread a square of cloth upon the sand, in the shadow of a mighty tree\nthat stood at the edge of the forest, and the King's ward took her seat\nupon it, and looked, in the golden light of the sinking sun, the very\nspirit of the isle. By this we two were alone on the beach. The hunters\nfor eggs, led by Diccon, were out upon the farthest gleaming horn;\nfrom the wood came the loud laughter of the fruit gatherers, and a most\nrollicking song issuing from the mighty chest of Master Jeremy Sparrow.\nWith the woodsmen had gone my lord.\n\nI walked a little way into the forest, and shouted a warning to Sparrow\nagainst venturing too far. When I returned to the giant tree and the\ncloth in the shadow of its outer branches, my wife was writing on the\nsand with a pointed shell. She had not seen or heard me, and I stood\nbehind her and read what she wrote. It was my name. She wrote it three\ntimes, slowly and carefully; then she felt my presence, glanced swiftly\nup, smiled, rubbed out my name, and wrote Sparrow's, Diccon's, and the\nKing's in succession. \"Lest I should forget to make my letters,\" she\nexplained.\n\nI sat down at her feet, and for some time we said no word. The light,\nfalling between the heavy blooms, cast bright sequins upon her dress and\ndark hair. The blooms were not more pink than her cheeks, the recesses\nof the forest behind us not deeper or darker than her eyes. The laughter\nand the song came faintly to us now. The sun was low in the west, and a\nwonderful light slept upon the sea.\n\n\"Last year we had a masque at court,\" she said at length, breaking the\nlong silence. \"We had Calypso's island, and I was Calypso. The island\nwas built of boards covered with green velvet, and there was a mound\nupon it of pink silk roses. There was a deep blue painted sea below,\nand a deep blue painted sky above. My nymphs danced around the mound of\nroses, while I sat upon a real rock beside the painted sea and talked\nwith Ulysses--to wit, my Lord of Buckingham--in gold armor. That was\na strange, bright, unreal, and wearisome day, but not so strange and\nunreal as this.\"\n\nShe ceased to speak, and began again to write upon the sand. I watched\nher white hand moving to and fro. She wrote, \"How long will it last?\"\n\n\"I do not know. Not long.\"\n\nShe wrote again: \"If there is time at the last, when you see that it is\nbest, will you kill me?\"\n\nI took the shell from her hand, and wrote my answer beneath her\nquestion.\n\nThe forest behind us sank into that pause and breathless hush between\nthe noises of the day and the noises of the night. The sun dropped\nlower, and the water became as pink as the blooms above us.\n\n\"An you could, would you change?\" I asked. \"Would you return to England\nand safety?\"\n\nShe took a handful of the sand and let it slowly drift through her white\nfingers. \"You know that I would not,\" she said; \"not if the end were\nto come to-night. Only--only\"--She turned from me and looked far out to\nsea. I could not see her face, only the dusk of her hair and her heaving\nbosom. \"My blood may be upon your hands,\" she said in a whisper, \"but\nyours will be upon my soul.\"\n\nShe turned yet further away, and covered her eyes with her hand. I\narose, and bent over her until I could have touched with my lips that\nbowed head. \"Jocelyn,\" I said.\n\nA branch of yellow fruit fell beside us, and my Lord Carnal, a mass of\ngaudy bloom in his hand, stepped from the wood. \"I returned to lay our\nfirst-fruits at madam's feet,\" he explained, his darkly watchful eyes\nupon us both. \"A gift from one poor prisoner to another, madam.\" He\ndropped the flowers in her lap. \"Will you wear them, lady? They are as\nfair almost as I could wish.\"\n\nShe touched the blossoms with listless fingers, said they were fair;\nthen, rising, let them drop upon the sand. \"I wear no flowers save of my\nhusband's gathering, my lord,\" she said.\n\nThere was a pathos and weariness in her voice, and a mist of unshed\ntears in her eyes. She hated him; she loved me not, yet was forced to\nturn to me for help at every point, and she had stood for weeks upon the\nbrink of death and looked unfalteringly into the gulf beneath her.\n\n\"My lord,\" I said, \"you know in what direction Master Sparrow led the\nmen. Will you reenter the wood and call them to return? The sun is fast\nsinking, and darkness will be upon us.\"\n\nHe looked from her to me, with his brows drawn downwards and his\nlips pressed together. Stooping, he took up the fallen flowers and\ndeliberately tore them to pieces, until the pink petals were all\nscattered upon the sand.\n\n\"I am weary of requests that are but sugared commands,\" he said thickly.\n\"Go seek your own men, an you will. Here we are but man to man, and\nI budge not. I stay, as the King would have me stay, beside the\nunfortunate lady whom you have made the prisoner and the plaything of a\npirate ship.\"\n\n\"You wear no sword, my Lord Carnal,\" I said at last, \"and so may lie\nwith impunity.\"\n\n\"But you can get me one!\" he cried, with ill-concealed eagerness.\n\nI laughed. \"I am not zealous in mine enemy's cause, my lord. I shall not\ndeprive Master Sparrow of your lordship's sword.\"\n\nBefore I knew what he was about he crossed the yard of sand between us\nand struck me in the face. \"Will that quicken your zeal?\" he demanded\nbetween his teeth.\n\nI seized him by the arm, and we stood so, both white with passion, both\nbreathing heavily. At length I flung his arm from me and stepped back.\n\"I fight not my prisoner,\" I said, \"nor, while the lady you have named\nabides upon that ship with the nobleman who, more than myself, is\nanswerable for her being there, do I put my life in unnecessary hazard.\nI will endure the smart as best I may, my lord, until a more convenient\nseason, when I will salve it well.\"\n\nI turned to Mistress Percy, and giving her my hand led her down to the\nboats; for I heard the fruit gatherers breaking through the wood,\nand the hunters for eggs, black figures against the crimson sky, were\nhurrying down the beach. Before the night had quite fallen we were out\nof the fairy harbor, and when the moon rose the islet looked only a\nsilver sail against the jeweled heavens.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV IN WHICH WE CHOOSE THE LESSER OF TWO EVILS\n\n\nTHE luck that had been ours could not hold; when the tide turned, it\nebbed fast.\n\nThe weather changed. One hurricane followed upon the stride of another,\nwith only a blue day or two between. Ofttimes we thought the ship was\nlost. All hands toiled like galley slaves; and as the heavens darkened,\nthere darkened also the mood of the pirates.\n\nIn sight of the great island of Cuba we gave chase to a bark. The sun\nwas shining and the sea fairly still when first she fled before us;\nwe gained upon her, and there was not a mile between us when a cloud\nblotted out the sun. The next minute our own sails gave us occupation\nenough. The storm, not we, was victor over the bark; she sank with a\nshriek from her decks that rang above the roaring wind. Two days later\nwe fought a large caravel. With a fortunate shot she brought down our\nforemast, and sailed away from us with small damage of her own. All that\nday and night the wind blew, driving us out of our course, and by dawn\nwe were as a shuttlecock between it and the sea. We weathered the gale,\nbut when the wind sank there fell on board that black ship a menacing\nsilence.\n\nIn the state cabin I held a council of war. Mistress Percy sat beside\nme, her arm upon the table, her hand shadowing her eyes; my lord,\nopposite, never took his gaze from her, though he listened gloomily to\nSparrow's rueful assertion that the brazen game we had been playing was\nwell-nigh over. Diccon, standing behind him, bit his nails and stared at\nthe floor.\n\n\"For myself I care not overmuch,\" ended the minister. \"I scorn not life,\nbut think it at its worst well worth the living; yet when my God calls\nme, I will go as to a gala day and triumph. You are a soldier, Captain\nPercy, you and Diccon here, and know how to die. You too, my Lord\nCarnal, are a brave man, though a most wicked one. For us four, we can\ndrink the cup, bitter though it be, with little trembling. But there is\none among us\"--His great voice broke, and he sat staring at the table.\n\nThe King's ward uncovered her eyes. \"If I be not a man and a soldier,\nMaster Sparrow,\" she said simply, \"yet I am the daughter of many valiant\ngentlemen. I will die as they died before me. And for me, as for you\nfour, it will be only death,--naught else.\" She looked at me with a\nproud smile.\n\n\"Naught else,\" I said.\n\nMy lord started from his seat and strode over to the window, where he\nstood drumming his fingers against the casing. I turned toward him. \"My\nLord Carnal,\" I said, \"you were overheard last night when you plotted\nwith the Spaniard.\"\n\nHe recoiled with a gasp, and his hand went to his side, where it found\nno sword. I saw his eyes busy here and there through the cabin, seeking\nsomething which he might convert into a weapon.\n\n\"I am yet captain of this ship,\" I continued. \"Why I do not, even though\nit be my last act of authority, have you flung to the sharks, I scarcely\nknow.\"\n\nHe threw back his head, all his bravado returned to him. \"It is not I\nthat stand in danger,\" he began loftily; \"and I would have you remember,\nsir, that you are my enemy, and that I owe you no loyalty.\"\n\n\"I am content to be your enemy,\" I answered.\n\n\"You do not dare to set upon me now,\" he went on, with his old insolent,\nboastful smile. \"Let me cry out, make a certain signal, and they without\nwill be here in a twinkling, breaking in the door\"--\"The signal set?\"\nI said. \"The mine laid, the match burning? Then 't is time that we were\ngone. When I bid the world good-night, my lord, my wife goes with me.\"\n\nHis lips moved and his black eyes narrowed, but he did not speak.\n\n\"An my cheek did not burn so,\" I said, \"I would be content to let you\nlive; live, captain in verity of this ship of devils, until, tired of\nyou, the devils cut your throat, or until some victorious Spaniard\nhung you at his yardarm; live even to crawl back to England, by hook\nor crook, to wait, hat in hand, in the antechamber of his Grace of\nBuckingham. As it is, I will kill you here and now. I restore you your\nsword, my lord, and there lies my challenge.\"\n\nI flung my glove at his feet, and Sparrow unbuckled the keen blade which\nhe had worn since the day I had asked it of its owner, and pushed it\nto me across the table. The King's ward leaned back in her chair, very\nwhite, but with a proud, still face, and hands loosely folded in her\nlap. My lord stood irresolute, his lip caught between his teeth, his\neyes upon the door.\n\n\"Cry out, my lord,\" I said. \"You are in danger. Cry to your friends\nwithout, who may come in time. Cry out loudly, like a soldier and a\ngentleman!\"\n\nWith a furious oath he stooped and caught up the glove at his feet; then\nsnatched out of my hand the sword that I offered him.\n\n\"Push back the settle, you; it is in the way!\" he cried to Diccon; then\nto me, in a voice thick with passion: \"Come on, sir! Here there are no\nmeddling governors; this time let Death throw down the warder!\"\n\n\"He throws it,\" said the minister beneath his breath.\n\nFrom without came a trampling and a sudden burst of excited voices. The\nnext instant the door was burst open, and a most villainous, fiery-red\nface thrust itself inside. \"A ship!\" bawled the apparition, and\nvanished. The clamor increased; voices cried for captain and mate, and\nmore pirates appeared at the door, swearing out the good news, come in\nsearch of Kirby, and giving no choice but to go with them at once.\n\n\"Until this interruption is over, sir,\" I said sternly, bowing to him as\nI spoke. \"No longer.\"\n\n\"Be sure, sir, that to my impatience the time will go heavily,\" he\nanswered as sternly.\n\nWe reached the poop to find the fog that had lain about us thick and\nwhite suddenly lifted, and the hot sunshine streaming down upon a rough\nblue sea. To the larboard, a league away, lay a low, endless coast of\nsand, as dazzling white as the surf that broke upon it, and running back\nto a matted growth of vivid green.\n\n\"That is Florida,\" said Paradise at my elbow, \"and there are reefs\nand shoals enough between us. It was Kirby's luck that the fog lifted.\nYonder tall ship hath a less fortunate star.\"\n\nShe lay between us and the white beach, evidently in shoal and dangerous\nwaters. She too had encountered a hurricane, and had not come forth\nvictorious. Foremast and forecastle were gone, and her bowsprit was\nbroken. She lay heavily, her ports but a few inches above the water.\nThough we did not know it then, most of her ordnance had been flung\noverboard to lighten her. Crippled as she was, with what sail she could\nset, she was beating back to open sea from that dangerous offing.\n\n\"Where she went we can follow!\" sang out a voice from the throng in our\nwaist. \"A d--d easy prize! And we'll give no quarter this time!\" There\nwas a grimness in the applause of his fellows that boded little good to\nsome on either ship.\n\n\"Lord help all poor souls this day!\" ejaculated the minister in\nundertones; then aloud and more hopefully, \"She hath not the look of a\ndon; maybe she's buccaneer.\"\n\n\"She is an English merchantman,\" said Paradise. \"Look at her colors. A\nCompany ship, probably, bound for Virginia, with a cargo of servants,\ngentlemen out at elbows, felons, children for apprentices, traders,\nFrench vignerons, glasswork Italians, returning Councilors and heads\nof hundreds, with their wives and daughters, men servants and maid\nservants. I made the Virginia voyage once myself, captain.\"\n\nI did not answer. I too saw the two crosses, and I did not doubt that\nthe arms upon the flag beneath were those of the Company. The vessel,\nwhich was of about two hundred tons, had mightily the look of the\nGeorge, a ship with which we at Jamestown were all familiar. Sparrow\nspoke for me.\n\n\"An English ship!\" he cried out of the simplicity of his heart. \"Then\nshe's safe enough for us! Perhaps we might speak her and show her that\nwe are English, too! Perhaps\"--He looked at me eagerly.\n\n\"Perhaps you might be let to go off to her in one of the boats,\"\nfinished Paradise dryly. \"I think not, Master Sparrow.\"\n\n\"It's other guess messengers that they'll send,\" muttered Diccon.\n\"They're uncovering the guns, sir.\"\n\nEvery man of those villains, save one, was of English birth; every\nman knew that the disabled ship was an English merchantman filled with\npeaceful folk, but the knowledge changed their plans no whit. There was\na great hubbub; cries and oaths and brutal laughter, the noise of the\ngunners with their guns, the clang of cutlass and pike as they were\ndealt out, but not a voice raised against the murder that was to be\ndone. I looked from the doomed ship, upon which there was now frantic\nhaste and confusion, to the excited throng below me, and knew that I had\nas well cry for mercy to winter wolves.\n\nThe helmsman behind me had not waited for orders, and we were bearing\ndown upon the disabled bark. Ahead of us, upon our larboard bow, was\na patch of lighter green, and beyond it a slight hurry and foam of the\nwaters. Half a dozen voices cried warning to the helmsman. It was he of\nthe woman's mantle, whom I had run through the shoulder on the island\noff Cape Charles, and he had been Kirby's pilot from Maracaibo to Fort\nCaroline. Now he answered with a burst of vaunting oaths: \"We're in deep\nwater, and there's deep water beyond. I've passed this way before, and\nI'll carry ye safe past that reef were 't hell's gate!\"\n\nThe desperadoes who heard him swore applause, and thought no more of\nthe reef that lay in wait. Long since they had gone through the gates\nof hell for the sake of the prize beyond. Knowing the appeal to be\nhopeless, I yet made it.\n\n\"She is English, men!\" I shouted. \"We will fight the Spaniards while\nthey have a flag in the Indies, but our own people we will not touch!\"\n\nThe clamor of shouts and oaths suddenly fell, and the wind in the\nrigging, the water at the keel, the surf on the shore, made themselves\nheard. In the silence, the terror of the fated ship became audible.\nConfused voices came to us, and the scream of a woman.\n\nOn the faces of a very few of the pirates there was a look of momentary\ndoubt and wavering; it passed, and the most had never worn it. They\nbegan to press forward toward the poop, cursing and threatening,\nworking themselves up into a rage that would not care for my sword, the\nminister's cutlass, or Diccon's pike. One who called himself a wit cried\nout something about Kirby and his methods, and two or three laughed.\n\n\"I find that the role of Kirby wearies me,\" I said. \"I am an English\ngentleman, and I will not fire upon an English ship.\"\n\nAs if in answer there came from our forecastle a flame and thunder of\nguns. The gunners there, intent upon their business, and now within\nrange of the merchantman, had fired the three forecastle culverins. The\nshot cut her rigging and brought down the flag. The pirates' shout of\ntriumph was echoed by a cry from her decks and the defiant roar of her\nfew remaining guns.\n\nI drew my sword. The minister and Diccon moved nearer to me, and the\nKing's ward, still and white and braver than a man, stood beside me.\nFrom the pirates that we faced came one deep breath, like the first\nsigh of the wind before the blast strikes. Suddenly the Spaniard pushed\nhimself to the front; with his gaunt figure and sable dress he had the\nseeming of a raven come to croak over the dead. He rested his gloomy\neyes upon my lord. The latter, very white, returned the look; then, with\nhis head held high, crossed the deck with a measured step and took his\nplace among us. He was followed a moment later by Paradise. \"I never\nthought to die in my bed, captain,\" said the latter nonchalantly.\n\"Sooner or later, what does it matter? And you must know that before\nI was a pirate I was a gentleman.\" Turning, he doffed his hat with a\nflourish to those he had quitted. \"Hell litter!\" he cried. \"I have run\nwith you long enough. Now I have a mind to die an honest man.\"\n\nAt this defection a dead hush of amazement fell upon that crew. One and\nall they stared at the man in black and silver, moistening their lips,\nbut saying no word. We were five armed and desperate men; they were\nfourscore. We might send many to death before us, but at the last we\nourselves must die,--we and those aboard the helpless ship.\n\nIn the moment's respite I bowed my head and whispered to the King's\nward.\n\n\"I had rather it were your sword,\" she answered in a low voice, in which\nthere was neither dread nor sorrow. \"You must not let it grieve you;\nit will be added to your good deeds. And it is I that should ask your\nforgiveness, not you mine.\"\n\nThough there was scant time for such dalliance, I bent my knee and\nrested my forehead upon her hand. As I rose, the minister's hand touched\nmy shoulder and the voice spoke in my ear. \"There is another way,\" he\nsaid. \"There is God's death, and not man's. Look and see what I mean.\"\n\nI followed the pointing of his eyes, and saw how close we were to those\nwhite and tumbling waters, the danger signal, the rattle of the hidden\nsnake. The eyes of the pirate at the helm, too, were upon them; his\nbrows were drawn downward, his lips pressed together, the whole man bent\nupon the ship's safe passage.... The low thunder of the surf, the cry of\na wheeling sea bird, the gleaming lonely shore, the cloudless sky, the\nocean, and the white sand far, far below, where one might sleep well,\nsleep well, with other valiant dead, long drowned, long changed. \"Of\ntheir bones are coral made.\"\n\nThe storm broke with fury and outcries, and a blue radiance of drawn\nsteel. A pistol ball sang past my ear.\n\n\"Don't shoot!\" roared the gravedigger to the man who had fired the shot.\n\"Don't cut them down! Take them and thrust them under hatches until\nwe've time to give them a slow death! And hands off the woman until\nwe've time to draw lots!\"\n\nHe and the Spaniard led the rush. I turned my head and nodded to\nSparrow, then faced them again. \"Then may the Lord have mercy upon your\nsouls!\" I said.\n\nAs I spoke the minister sprang upon the helmsman, and, striking him\nto the deck with one blow of his huge fist, himself seized the\nwheel. Before the pirates could draw breath he had jammed the helm to\nstarboard, and the reef lay right across our bows.\n\nA dreadful cry went up from that black ship to a deaf Heaven,--a cry\nthat was echoed by a wild shout of triumph from the merchantman. The\nmass fronting us broke in terror and rage and confusion. Some ran\nfrantically up and down with shrieks and curses; others sprang\noverboard. A few made a dash for the poop and for us who stood to meet\nthem. They were led by the Spaniard and the gravedigger. The former I\nmet and sent tumbling back into the waist; the latter whirled past me,\nand rushing upon Paradise thrust him through with a pike, then dashed on\nto the wheel, to be met and hewn down by Diccon.\n\nThe ship struck. I put my arm around my wife, and my hand before her\neyes; and while I looked only at her, in that storm of terrible cries,\nof flapping canvas, rushing water, and crashing timbers, the Spaniard\nclambered like a catamount upon the poop, that was now high above the\nbroken forepart of the ship, and fired his pistol at me point-blank.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV IN WHICH MY LORD HATH HIS DAY\n\n\nI AND Black Lamoral were leading a forlorn hope. With all my old company\nbehind us, we were thundering upon an enemy as thick as ants, covering\nthe face of the earth. Down came Black Lamoral, and the hoofs of every\nmad charger went over me. For a time I was dead; then I lived again, and\nwas walking with the forester's daughter in the green chase at home. The\noaks stretched broad sheltering arms above the young fern and the little\nwild flowers, and the deer turned and looked at us. In the open spaces,\nstarring the lush grass, were all the yellow primroses that ever\nbloomed. I gathered them for her, but when I would have given them to\nher she was no longer the forester's daughter, but a proud lady,\nheiress to lands and gold, the ward of the King. She would not take the\nprimroses from a poor gentleman, but shook her head and laughed sweetly,\nand faded into a waterfall that leaped from a pink hill into a waveless\nsea. Another darkness, and I was captive to the Chickahominies, tied to\nthe stake. My arm and shoulder were on fire, and Opechancanough came and\nlooked at me, with his dark, still face and his burning eyes. The fierce\npain died, and I with it, and I lay in a grave and listened to the loud\nand deep murmur of the forest above. I lay there for ages on ages before\nI awoke to the fact that the darkness about me was the darkness of\na ship's hold, and the murmur of the forest the wash of the water\nalongside. I put out an arm and touched, not the side of a grave, but a\nship's timbers. I stretched forth the other arm, then dropped it with a\ngroan. Some one bent over me and held water to my lips. I drank, and my\nsenses came fully to me. \"Diccon!\" I said.\n\n\"It's not Diccon,\" replied the figure, setting down a pitcher. \"It is\nJeremy Sparrow. Thank God, you are yourself again!\"\n\n\"Where are we?\" I asked, when I had lain and listened to the water a\nlittle longer.\n\n\"In the hold of the George,\" he answered. \"The ship sank by the bows,\nand well-nigh all were drowned. But when they upon the George saw that\nthere was a woman amongst us who clung to the poop deck, they sent their\nlongboat to take us off.\"\n\nThe light was too dim for me to read his face, so I touched his arm.\n\n\"She was saved,\" he said. \"She is safe now. There are gentlewomen\naboard, and she is in their care.\"\n\nI put my unhurt arm across my eyes.\n\n\"You are weak yet,\" said the minister gently. \"The Spaniard's ball, you\nknow, went through your shoulder, and in some way your arm was badly\ntorn from shoulder to wrist. You have been out of your head ever since\nwe were brought here, three days ago. The chirurgeon came and dressed\nyour wound, and it is healing well. Don't try to speak,--I'll tell\nyou all. Diccon has been pressed into service, as the ship is short of\nhands, having lost some by fever and some overboard. Four of the pirates\nwere picked up, and hung at the yardarm next morning.\"\n\nHe moved as he spoke, and something clanked in the stillness. \"You are\nironed!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"Only my ankles. My lord would have had me bound hand and foot; but you\nwere raving for water, and, taking you for a dying man, they were so\nhumane as to leave my hands free to attend you.\"\n\n\"My lord would have had you bound,\" I said slowly. \"Then it's my lord's\nday.\"\n\n\"High noon and blazing sunshine,\" he answered, with a rueful laugh. \"It\nseems that half the folk on board had gaped at him at court. Lord! when\nhe put his foot over the side of the ship, how the women screeched and\nthe men stared! He 's cock of the walk now, my Lord Carnal, the King's\nfavorite!\"\n\n\"And we are pirates.\"\n\n\"That 's the case in a nutshell,\" he answered cheerfully.\n\n\"Do they know how the ship came to strike upon that reef?\" I asked.\n\n\"Probably not, unless madam has enlightened them. I did n't take the\ntrouble,--they would n't have believed me,--and I can take my oath my\nlord has n't. He was only our helpless prisoner, you know; and they\nwould think madam mistaken or bewitched.\"\n\n\"It 's not a likely tale,\" I said grimly, \"seeing that we had already\nopened fire upon them.\"\n\n\"I trust in heaven the sharks got the men who fired the culverins!\" he\ncried, and then laughed at his own savagery.\n\nI lay still and tried to think. \"Who are they on board?\" I asked at\nlast.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he replied. \"I was only on deck until my lord had had\nhis say in the poop cabin with the master and a gentleman who appeared\nmost in authority. Then the pirates were strung up, and we were bundled\ndown here in quick order. But there seems to be more of quality than\nusual aboard.\"\n\n\"You do not know where we are?\"\n\n\"We lay at anchor for a day,--whilst they patched her up, I\nsuppose,--and since then there has been rough weather. We must be still\noff Florida, and that is all I know. Now go to sleep. You'll get your\nstrength best so, and there's nothing to be gotten by waking.\"\n\nHe began to croon a many-versed psalm. I slept and waked, and slept\nagain, and was waked by the light of a torch against my eyes. The torch\nwas held by a much-betarred seaman, and by its light a gentleman of a\nvery meagre aspect, with a weazen face and small black eyes, was busily\nexamining my wounded shoulder and arm.\n\n\"It passeth belief,\" he said in a sing-song voice, \"how often wounds,\nwith naught in the world done for them outside of fair water and a clean\nrag, do turn to and heal out of sheer perversity. Now, if I had been\nallowed to treat this one properly with scalding oil and melted lead,\nand to have bled the patient as he should have been bled, it is ten to\none that by this time there would have been a pirate the less in the\nworld.\" He rose to his feet with a highly injured countenance.\n\n\"Then he's doing well?\" asked Sparrow.\n\n\"So well that he could n't do better,\" replied the other. \"The arm was\na trifling matter, though no doubt exquisitely painful. The wound in\nthe shoulder is miraculously healing, without either blood-letting or\ncauteries. You'll have to hang after all, my friend.\" He looked at me\nwith his little beady eyes. \"It must have been a grand life,\" he said\nregretfully. \"I never expected to see a pirate chief in the flesh. When\nI was a boy, I used to dream of the black ships and the gold and the\nfighting. By the serpent of Esculapius, in my heart of hearts I would\nrather be such a world's thief, uncaught, than Governor of Virginia!\" He\ngathered up the tools of his trade, and motioned to his torchbearer\nto go before. \"I'll have to report you rapidly recovering,\" he said\nwarningly, as he turned to follow the light.\n\n\"Very well,\" I made answer. \"To whom am I indebted for so much\nkindness?\"\n\n\"I am Dr. John Pott, newly appointed physician general to the colony of\nVirginia. It is little of my skill I could give you, but that little I\ngladly bestow upon a real pirate. What a life it must have been! And to\nhave to part with it when you are yet young! And the good red gold and\nthe rich gems all at the bottom of the sea!\"\n\nHe sighed heavily and went his way. The hatches were closed after\nhim, and the minister and I were left in darkness while the slow hours\ndragged themselves past us. Through the chinks of the hatches a very\nfaint light streamed down, and made the darkness gray instead of black.\nThe minister and I saw each other dimly, as spectres. Some one brought\nus mouldy biscuit that I wanted not, and water for which I thirsted.\nSparrow put the small pitcher to his lips, kept it there a moment, then\nheld it to mine. I drank, and with that generous draught tasted pure\nbliss. It was not until five minutes later that I raised myself upon my\nelbow and turned on him.\n\n\"The pitcher felt full to my lips!\" I exclaimed. \"Did you drink when you\nsaid you did?\"\n\nHe put out his great hand and pushed me gently down. \"I have no wound,\"\nhe said, \"and there was not enough for two.\"\n\nThe light that trembled through the cracks above died away, and the\ndarkness became gross. The air in the hold was stifling; our souls\npanted for the wind and the stars outside. At the worst, when the fetid\nblackness lay upon our chests like a nightmare, the hatch was suddenly\nlifted, a rush of pure air came to us, and with it the sound of men's\nvoices speaking on the deck above. Said one, \"True the doctor pronounces\nhim out of all danger, yet he is a wounded man.\"\n\n\"He is a desperate and dangerous man,\" broke in another harshly. \"I\nknow not how you will answer to your Company for leaving him unironed so\nlong.\"\n\n\"I and the Company understand each other, my lord,\" rejoined the first\nspeaker, with some haughtiness. \"I can keep my prisoner without advice.\nIf I now order irons to be put upon him and his accomplice, it is\nbecause I see fit to do so, and not because of your suggestion, my lord.\nYou wish to take this opportunity to have speech with him,--to that I\ncan have no objection.\"\n\nThe speaker moved away. As his footsteps died in the distance my lord\nlaughed, and his merriment was echoed by three or four harsh voices.\nSome one struck flint against steel, and there was a sudden flare\nof torches and the steadier light of a lantern. A man with a brutal,\nweather-beaten face--the master of the ship, we guessed--came down the\nladder, lantern in hand, turned when he had reached the foot, and held\nup the lantern to light my lord down. I lay and watched the King's\nfavorite as he descended. The torches held slantingly above cast a fiery\nlight over his stately figure and the face which had raised him from the\nlow estate of a doubtful birth and a most lean purse to a pinnacle too\nnear the sun for men to gaze at with undazzled eyes. In his rich dress\nand the splendor of his beauty, with the red glow enveloping him, he lit\nthe darkness like a baleful star.\n\nThe two torchbearers and a third man descended, closing the hatch after\nthem. When all were down, my lord, the master at his heels, came and\nstood over me. I raised myself, though with difficulty, for the fever\nhad left me weak as a babe, and met his gaze. His was a cruel look; if\nI had expected, as assuredly I did not expect, mercy or generosity\nfrom this my dearest foe, his look would have struck such a hope dead.\nPresently he beckoned to the men behind him. \"Put the manacles upon him\nfirst,\" he said, with a jerk of his thumb toward Sparrow.\n\nThe man who had come down last, and who carried irons enough to fetter\nsix pirates, started forward to do my lord's bidding. The master glanced\nat Sparrow's great frame, and pulled out a pistol. The minister laughed.\n\"You'll not need it, friend. I know when the odds are too great.\" He\nheld out his arms, and the men fettered them wrist to wrist. When they\nhad finished he said calmly: \"'I have seen the wicked in great power,\nand spreading himself like a green bay tree. Yet he passed away, and,\nlo, he was not: yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.'\"\n\nMy lord turned from him, and pointed to me. He kept his eyes upon my\nface while they shackled me hand and foot; then said abruptly, \"You have\ncords there: bind his arms to his sides.\" The men wound the cords around\nme many times. \"Draw them tight,\" commanded my lord.\n\nThere came a wrathful clank of the minister's chains. \"The arm is torn\nand inflamed from shoulder to wrist, as I make no doubt you have been\ntold!\" he cried. \"For very shame, man!\"\n\n\"Draw them tighter,\" said my lord, between his teeth.\n\nThe men knotted the cords, and rose to their feet, to be dismissed by my\nlord with a curt \"You may go.\" They drew back to the foot of the ladder,\nwhile the master of the ship went and perched himself upon one of the\nrungs. \"The air is fresher here beneath the hatch,\" he remarked.\n\nAs for me, though I lay at my enemy's feet, I could yet set my teeth and\nlook him in the eyes. The cup was bitter, but I could drink it with an\nunmoved face.\n\n\"Art paid?\" he demanded. \"Art paid for the tree in the red forest\nwithout the haunted wood? Art paid, thou bridegroom?\"\n\n\"No,\" I answered. \"Bring her here to laugh at me as she laughed in the\ntwilight beneath the guesthouse window.\"\n\nI thought he would murder me with the poniard he drew, but presently he\nput it up.\n\n\"She is come to her senses,\" he said. \"Up in the state cabin are bright\nlights, and wine and laughter. There are gentlewomen aboard, and I have\nbeen singing to the lute, to them--and to her. She is saved from the\nperil into which you plunged her; she knows that the King's Court of\nHigh Commission, to say nothing of the hangman, will soon snap the\nfetters which she now shudders to think of; that the King and one\nbesides will condone her past short madness. Her cheeks are roses, her\neyes are stars. But now, when I pressed her hand between the verses of\nmy song, she smiled and sighed and blushed. She is again the dutiful\nward of the King, the Lady Jocelyn Leigh--she hath asked to be so\ncalled\"--\n\n\"You lie,\" I said. \"She is my true and noble wife. She may sit in the\nstate cabin, in the air and warmth and light, she may even laugh with\nher lips, but her heart is here with me in the hold.\"\n\nAs I spoke, I knew, and knew not how I knew, that the thing which I had\nsaid was true. With that knowledge came a happiness so deep and strong\nthat it swept aside like straw the torment of those cords, and the\ndeeper hurt that I lay at his feet. I suppose my face altered, and\nmirrored that blessed glow about my heart, for into his own came a white\nfury, changing its beauty into something inhuman and terrifying. He\nlooked a devil baffled. For a minute he stood there rigid, with hands\nclenched. \"Embrace her heart, if thou canst,\" he said, in a voice so low\nthat it came like a whisper from the realm he might have left. \"I shall\npress my face against her bosom.\"\n\nAnother minute of a silence that I disdained to break; then he turned\nand went up the ladder. The seamen and the master followed. The hatch\nwas clapped to and fastened, and we were left to the darkness and the\nheavy air, and to a grim endurance of what could not be cured.\n\nDuring those hours of thirst and torment I came indeed to know the man\nwho sat beside me. His hands were so fastened that he could not loosen\nthe cords, and there was no water for him to give me; but he could\nand did bestow a higher alms,--the tenderness of a brother, the manly\nsympathy of a soldier, the balm of the priest of God. I lay in silence,\nand he spoke not often; but when he did so, there was that in the tone\nof his voice--Another cycle of pain, and I awoke from a half swoon,\nin which there was water to drink and no anguish, to hear him praying\nbeside me. He ceased to speak, and in the darkness I heard him draw his\nbreath hard and his great muscles crack. Suddenly there came a sharp\nsound of breaking iron, and a low \"Thank Thee, Lord!\" Another moment,\nand I felt his hands busy at the knotted cords. \"I will have them off\nthee in a twinkling, Ralph,\" he said, \"thanks to Him who taught my hands\nto war, and my arms to break in two a bow of steel.\" As he spoke, the\ncords loosened beneath his fingers.\n\nI raised my head and laid it on his knee, and he put his great arm, with\nthe broken chain dangling from it, around me, and, like a mother with a\nbabe, crooned me to sleep with the twenty-third psalm.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI IN WHICH I AM BROUGHT TO TRIAL\n\n\nMY lord came not again into the hold, and the untied cords and the\nbroken chain were not replaced. Morning and evening we were brought a\nniggard allowance of bread and water; but the man who carried it bore\nno light, and may not even have observed their absence. We saw no one in\nauthority. Hour by hour my wounds healed and my strength returned. If\nit was a dark and noisome prison, if there were hunger and thirst and\ninaction to be endured, if we knew not how near to us might be a death\nof ignominy, yet the minister and I found the jewel in the head of the\ntoad; for in that time of pain and heaviness we became as David and\nJonathan.\n\nAt last some one came beside the brute who brought us food. A quiet\ngentleman, with whitening hair and bright dark eyes, stood before us. He\nhad ordered the two men with him to leave open the hatch, and he held\nin his hand a sponge soaked with vinegar. \"Which of you is--or rather\nwas--Captain Ralph Percy?\" he asked, in a grave but pleasant voice.\n\n\"I am Captain Percy,\" I answered.\n\nHe looked at me with attention. \"I have heard of you before,\" he said.\n\"I read the letter you wrote to Sir Edwyn Sandys, and thought it an\nexcellently conceived and manly epistle. What magic transformed a\ngentleman and a soldier into a pirate?\"\n\nAs he waited for me to speak, I gave him for answer, \"Necessity.\"\n\n\"A sad metamorphosis,\" he said. \"I had rather read of nymphs changed\ninto laurel and gushing springs. I am come to take you, sir, before the\nofficers of the Company aboard this ship, when, if you have aught to say\nfor yourself, you may say it. I need not tell you, who saw so clearly\nsome time ago the danger in which you then stood, that your plight is\nnow a thousandfold worse.\"\n\n\"I am perfectly aware of it,\" I said. \"Am I to go in fetters?\"\n\n\"No,\" he replied, with a smile. \"I have no instructions on the subject,\nbut I will take it upon myself to free you from them,--even for the sake\nof that excellently writ letter.\"\n\n\"Is not this gentleman to go too?\" I asked.\n\nHe shook his head. \"I have no orders to that effect.\"\n\nWhile the men who were with him removed the irons from my wrists and\nankles he stood in silence, regarding me with a scrutiny so close that\nit would have been offensive had I been in a position to take offense.\nWhen they had finished I turned and held Jeremy's hand in mine for an\ninstant, then followed the new-comer to the ladder and out of the hold;\nthe two men coming after us, and resolving themselves above into a\nguard. As we traversed the main deck we came upon Diccon, busy with two\nor three others about the ports. He saw me, and, dropping the bar that\nhe held, started forward, to be plucked back by an angry arm. The men\nwho guarded me pushed in between us, and there was no word spoken by\neither. I walked on, the gentleman at my side, and presently came to an\nopen port, and saw, with an intake of my breath, the sunshine, a dark\nblue heaven flecked with white, and a quiet ocean. My companion glanced\nat me keenly.\n\n\"Doubtless it seems fair enough, after that Cimmerian darkness below,\"\nhe remarked. \"Would you like to rest here a moment?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, and, leaning against the side of the port, looked out at\nthe beauty of the light.\n\n\"We are off Hatteras,\" he informed me, \"but we have not met with the\nstormy seas that vex poor mariners hereabouts. Those sails you see on\nour quarter belong to our consort. We were separated by the hurricane\nthat nigh sunk us, and finally drove us, helpless as we were, toward\nthe Florida coast and across your path. For us that was a fortunate reef\nupon which you dashed. The gods must have made your helmsman blind,\nfor he ran you into a destruction that gaped not for you. Why did every\nwretch that we hung next morning curse you before he died?\"\n\n\"If I told you, you would not believe me,\" I replied.\n\nI was dizzy with the bliss of the air and the light, and it seemed a\nsmall thing that he would not believe me. The wind sounded in my ears\nlike a harp, and the sea beckoned. A white bird flashed down into the\ncrystal hollow between two waves, hung there a second, then rose, a\nsilver radiance against the blue. Suddenly I saw a river, dark and\nridged beneath thunderclouds, a boat, and in it, her head pillowed upon\nher arm, a woman, who pretended that she slept. With a shock my senses\nsteadied, and I became myself again. The sea was but the sea, the wind\nthe wind; in the hold below me lay my friend; somewhere in that ship was\nmy wife; and awaiting me in the state cabin were men who perhaps had\nthe will, as they had the right and the might, to hang me at the yardarm\nthat same hour.\n\n\"I have had my fill of rest,\" I said. \"Whom am I to stand before?\"\n\n\"The newly appointed officers of the Company, bound in this ship for\nVirginia,\" he answered. \"The ship carries Sir Francis Wyatt, the new\nGovernor; Master Davison, the Secretary; young Clayborne, the surveyor\ngeneral; the knight marshal, the physician general, and the Treasurer,\nwith other gentlemen, and with fair ladies, their wives and sisters. I\nam George Sandys, the Treasurer.\"\n\nThe blood rushed to my face, for it hurt me that the brother of Sir\nEdwyn Sandys should believe that the firing of those guns had been my\nact. His was the trained observation of the traveler and writer, and he\nprobably read the color aright. \"I pity you, if I can no longer esteem\nyou,\" he said, after a pause. \"I know no sorrier sight than a brave\nman's shield reversed.\"\n\nI bit my lip and kept back the angry word. The next minute saw us at\nthe door of the state cabin. It opened, and my companion entered, and\nI after him, with my two guards at my back. Around a large table were\ngathered a number of gentlemen, some seated, some standing. There\nwere but two among them whom I had seen before,--the physician who had\ndressed my wound and my Lord Carnal. The latter was seated in a great\nchair, beside a gentleman with a pleasant active face and light brown\ncurling hair,--the new Governor, as I guessed. The Treasurer, nodding to\nthe two men to fall back to the window, glided to a seat upon my lord's\nother hand, and I went and stood before the Governor of Virginia.\n\nFor some moments there was silence in the cabin, every man being engaged\nin staring at me with all his eyes; then the Governor spoke: \"It should\nbe upon your knees, sir.\"\n\n\"I am neither petitioner nor penitent,\" I said. \"I know no reason why I\nshould kneel, your Honor.\"\n\n\"There 's reason, God wot, why you should be both!\" he exclaimed. \"Did\nyou not, now some months agone, defy the writ of the King and Company,\nrefusing to stand when called upon to do so in the King's name?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Did you not, when he would have stayed your lawless flight, lay violent\nhands upon a nobleman high in the King's favor, and, overpowering him\nwith numbers, carry him out of the King's realm?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Did you not seduce from her duty to the King, and force to fly with\nyou, his Majesty's ward, the Lady Jocelyn Leigh?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said. \"There was with me only my wife, who chose to follow the\nfortunes of her husband.\"\n\nHe frowned, and my lord swore beneath his breath. \"Did you not, falling\nin with a pirate ship, cast in your lot with the scoundrels upon it, and\nyourself turn pirate?\"\n\n\"In some sort.\"\n\n\"And become their chief?\"\n\n\"Since there was no other situation open,--yes.\"\n\n\"Taking with you as captives upon the pirate ship that lady and that\nnobleman?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You proceeded to ravage the dominions of the King of Spain, with whom\nhis Majesty is at peace\"--\n\n\"Like Drake and Raleigh,--yes,\" I said.\n\nHe smiled, then frowned \"Tempora mutantur,\" he said dryly. \"And I have\nnever heard that Drake or Raleigh attacked an English ship.\"\n\n\"Nor have I attacked one,\" I said.\n\nHe leaned back in his chair and stared at me. \"We saw the flame and\nheard the thunder of your guns, and our rigging was cut by the shot. Did\nyou expect me to believe that last assertion?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then you might have spared yourself--and us--that lie,\" he said coldly.\n\nThe Treasurer moved restlessly in his seat, and began to whisper to his\nneighbor the Secretary. A young man, with the eyes of a hawk and an iron\njaw,--Clayborne, the surveyor general,--who sat at the end of the table\nbeside the window, turned and gazed out upon the clouds and the sea,\nas if, contempt having taken the place of curiosity, he had no further\ninterest in the proceedings. As for me, I set my face like a flint,\nand looked past the man who might have saved me that last speech of the\nGovernor's as if he had never been.\n\nThere was a closed door in the cabin, opposite the one by which I had\nentered. Suddenly from behind it came the sound of a short struggle,\nfollowed by the quick turn of a key in the lock. The door was flung\nopen, and two women entered the cabin. One, a fair young gentlewoman,\nwith tears in her brown eyes, came forward hurriedly with outspread\nhands.\n\n\"I did what I could, Frank!\" she cried. \"When she would not listen to\nreason, I e'en locked the door; but she is strong, for all that she has\nbeen ill, and she forced the key out of my hand!\" She looked at the red\nmark upon the white hand, and two tears fell from her long lashes upon\nher wild-rose cheeks.\n\nWith a smile the Governor put out an arm and drew her down upon a stool\nbeside him, then rose and bowed low to the King's ward. \"You are not yet\nwell enough to leave your cabin, as our worthy physician general will\nassure you, lady,\" he said courteously, but firmly. \"Permit me to lead\nyou back to it.\"\n\nStill smiling he made as if to advance, when she stayed him with a\ngesture of her raised hand, at once so majestic and so pleading that it\nwas as though a strain of music had passed through the stillness of the\ncabin.\n\n\"Sir Francis Wyatt, as you are a gentleman, let me speak,\" she said.\nIt was the voice of that first night at Weyanoke, all pathos, all\nsweetness, all entreating.\n\nThe Governor stopped short, the smile still upon his lips, his hand\nstill outstretched,--stood thus for a moment, then sat down. Around the\nhalf circle of gentlemen went a little rustling sound, like wind in dead\nleaves. My lord half rose from his seat. \"She is bewitched,\" he said,\nwith dry lips. \"She will say what she has been told to say. Lest she\nspeak to her shame, we should refuse to hear her.\"\n\nShe had been standing in the centre of the floor, her hands clasped, her\nbody bowed toward the Governor, but at my lord's words she straightened\nlike a bow unbent. \"I may speak, your Honor?\" she asked clearly.\n\nThe Governor, who had looked askance at the working face of the\nman beside him, slightly bent his head and leaned back in his great\narmchair. The King's favorite started to his feet. The King's ward\nturned her eyes upon him. \"Sit down, my lord,\" she said. \"Surely these\ngentlemen will think that you are afraid of what I, a poor erring woman,\nrebellious to the King, traitress to mine own honor, late the plaything\nof a pirate ship, may say or do. Truth, my lord, should be more\ncourageous.\" Her voice was gentle, even plaintive, but it had in it the\nquality that lurks in the eyes of the crouching panther.\n\nMy lord sat down, one hand hiding his working mouth, the other clenched\non the arm of his chair as if it had been an arm of flesh.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII IN WHICH I FIND AN ADVOCATE\n\n\nSHE came slowly nearer the ring of now very quiet and attentive faces\nuntil she stood beside me, but she neither looked at me nor spoke to me.\nShe was thinner and there were heavy shadows beneath her eyes, but she\nwas beautiful.\n\n\"I stand before gentlemen to whom, perhaps, I am not utterly unknown,\"\nshe said. \"Some here, perchance, have been to court, and have seen me\nthere. Master Sandys, once, before the Queen died, you came to Greenwich\nto kiss her Majesty's hands; and while you waited in her antechamber you\nsaw a young maid of honor--scarce more than a child--curled in a window\nseat with a book. You sat beside her, and told her wonderful tales\nof sunny lands and gods and nymphs. I was that maid of honor. Master\nClayborne, once, hawking near Windsor, I dropped my glove. There were a\nmany out of their saddles before it touched the ground, but a gentleman,\nnot of our party, who had drawn his horse to one side to let us pass,\nwas quicker than they all. Did you not think yourself well paid, sir,\nwhen you kissed the hand to which you restored the glove? All here, I\nthink, may have heard my name. If any hath heard aught that ever I\ndid in all my life to tarnish it, I pray him to speak now and shame me\nbefore you all!\"\n\nClayborne started up. \"I remember that day at Windsor, lady!\" he cried.\n\"The man of whom I afterward asked your name was a most libertine\ncourtier, and he raised his hat when he spoke of you, calling you a lily\nwhich the mire of the court could not besmirch. I will believe all good,\nbut no harm of you, lady!\"\n\nHe sat down, and Master Sandys said gravely: \"Men need not be courtiers\nto have known of a lady of great wealth and high birth, a ward of the\nKing's, and both beautiful and pure. I nor no man else, I think, ever\nheard aught of the Lady Jocelyn Leigh but what became a daughter of her\nline.\"\n\nA murmur of assent went round the circle. The Governor, leaning forward\nfrom his seat, his wife's hand in his, gravely bent his head. \"All this\nis known, lady,\" he said courteously.\n\nShe did not answer; her eyes were upon the King's favorite, and the\ncircle waited with her.\n\n\"It is known,\" said my lord.\n\nShe smiled proudly. \"For so much grace, thanks, my lord,\" she said, then\naddressed herself again to the Governor: \"Your Honor, that is the past,\nthe long past, the long, long past, though not a year has gone by. Then\nI was a girl, proud and careless; now, your Honor, I am a woman, and\nI stand here in the dignity of suffering and peril. I fled from\nEngland\"--She paused, drew herself up, and turned upon my lord a face\nand form so still, and yet so expressive of noble indignation, outraged\nwomanhood, scorn, and withal a kind of angry pity, that small wonder if\nhe shrank as from a blow. \"I left the only world I knew,\" she said. \"I\ntook a way low and narrow and dark and set with thorns, but the only way\nthat I--alone and helpless and bewildered---could find, because that I,\nJocelyn Leigh, willed not to wed with you, my Lord Carnal. Why did you\nfollow me, my lord? You knew that I loved you not. You knew my mind,\nand that I was weak and friendless, and you used your power. I must\ntell you, my lord, that you were not chivalrous, nor compassionate, nor\nbrave\"--\n\n\"I loved you!\" he cried, and stretched out his arm toward her across the\ntable. He saw no one but her, spoke to none but her. There was a fierce\nyearning and a hopelessness in his voice and bent head and outstretched\narm that lent for the time a tragic dignity to the pageant, evil and\nmagnificent, of his life.\n\n\"You loved me,\" she said. \"I had rather you had hated me, my lord. I\ncame to Virginia, your Honor, and men thought me the thing I professed\nmyself. In the green meadow beyond the church they wooed me as such.\nThis one came and that one, and at last a fellow, when I said him nay\nand bade him begone, did dare to seize my hands and kiss my lips. While\nI struggled one came and flung that dastard out of the way, then asked\nme plainly to become his wife, and there was no laugh or insult in his\nvoice. I was wearied and fordone and desperate.... So I met my husband,\nand so I married him. That same day I told him a part of my secret, and\nwhen my Lord Carnal was come I told him all.... I had not met with much\ntrue love or courtesy or compassion in my life. When I saw the danger in\nwhich he stood because of me, I told him he might free himself from that\ncoil, might swear to what they pleased, whistle me off, save himself,\nand I would say no word of blame. There was wine upon the table, and he\nfilled a cup and brought it to me, and we drank of it together. We drank\nof the same cup then, your Honor, and we will drink of it still. We\ntwain were wedded, and the world strove to part us. Which of you here,\nin such quarrel, would not withstand the world? Lady Wyatt, would not\nthy husband hold thee, while he lived, against the world? Then speak for\nmine!\"\n\n\"Frank, Frank!\" cried Lady Wyatt. \"They love each other!\"\n\n\"If he withstood the King,\" went on the King's ward, \"it was for his\nhonor and for mine. If he fled from Virginia, it was because I willed\nit so. Had he stayed, my Lord Carnal, and had you willed to follow me\nagain, you must have made a yet longer journey to a most distant bourne.\nThat wild night when we fled, why did you come upon us, my lord? The\nmoon burst forth from a black cloud, and you stood there upon the wharf\nabove us, calling to the footsteps behind to hasten. We would have left\nyou there in safety, and gone ourselves alone down that stream as black\nand strange as death. Why did you spring down the steps and grapple with\nthe minister? And he that might have thrust you beneath the flood and\ndrowned you there did but fling you into the boat. We wished not your\ncompany, my lord; we would willingly have gone without you. I trust, my\nlord, you have made honest report of this matter, and have told these\ngentlemen that my husband gave you, a prisoner whom he wanted not, all\nfair and honorable treatment. That you have done this I dare take my\noath, my lord\"--\n\nShe stood silent, her eyes upon his. The men around stirred, and a\nlittle flash like the glint of drawn steel went from one pair of eyes to\nanother.\n\n\"My lord, my lord!\" said the King's ward. \"Long ago you won my hatred;\nan you would not win my contempt, speak truth this day!\"\n\nIn his eyes, which he had never taken from her face, there leaped to\nmeet the proud appeal in her own a strange fire. That he loved her with\na great and evil passion, I, who needs had watched him closely, had\nlong known. Suddenly he burst into jarring laughter. \"Yea, he treated me\nfairly enough, damn him to everlasting hell! But he 's a pirate, sweet\nbird; he's a pirate, and must swing as such!\"\n\n\"A pirate!\" she cried. \"But he was none! My lord, you know he was none!\nYour Honor\"--\n\nThe Governor interrupted her: \"He made himself captain of a pirate ship,\nlady. He took and sunk ships of Spain.\"\n\n\"In what sort did he become their chief?\" she cried. \"In such sort,\ngentlemen, as the bravest of you, in like straits, would have been\nblithe to be, an you had had like measure of wit and daring! Your Honor,\nthe wind before which our boat drave like a leaf, the waves that would\nengulf us, wrecked us upon a desert isle. There was no food or water\nor shelter. That night, while we slept, a pirate ship anchored off the\nbeach, and in the morning the pirates came ashore to bury their captain.\nMy husband met them alone, fought their would-be leaders one by one, and\nforced the election to fall upon himself. Well he knew that if he left\nnot that isle their leader, he would leave it their captive; and not\nhe alone! God's mercy, gentlemen, what other could he do? I pray you\nto hold him absolved from a willing embrace of that life! Sunk ships\nof Spain! Yea, forsooth; and how long hath it been since other English\ngentlemen sunk other ships of Spain? The world hath changed indeed if\nto fight the Spaniard in the Indies, e'en though at home we be at peace\nwith him, be conceived so black a crime! He fought their galleons fair\nand knightly, with his life in his hand; he gave quarter, and while\nthey called him chief those pirates tortured no prisoner and wronged\nno woman. Had he not been there, would the ships have been taken less\nsurely? Had he not been there, God wot, ships and ships' boats alike\nwould have sunk or burned, and no Spanish men and women had rowed away\nand blessed a generous foe. A pirate! He, with me and with the minister\nand with my Lord Carnal, was prisoner to the pirates, and out of that\ndanger he plucked safety for us all! Who hath so misnamed a gallant\ngentleman? Was it you, my lord?\"\n\nEyes and voice were imperious, and in her cheeks burned an indignant\ncrimson. My lord's face was set and white; he looked at her, but spoke\nno word.\n\n\"The Spanish ships might pass, lady,\" said the Governor; \"but this is an\nEnglish ship, with the flag of England above her.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" she said. \"What then?\"\n\nThe circle rustled again. The Governor loosed his wife's fingers and\nleaned forward. \"You plead well, lady!\" he exclaimed. \"You might win, an\nCaptain Percy had not seen fit to fire upon us.\"\n\nA dead silence followed his words. Outside the square window a cloud\npassed from the face of the sun, and a great burst of sunshine entered\nthe cabin. She stood in the heart of it, and looked a goddess angered.\nMy lord, with his haggard face and burning eyes, slowly rose from his\nseat, and they faced each other.\n\n\"You told them not who fired those guns, who sunk that pirate ship?\"\nshe said. \"Because he was your enemy, you held your tongue? Knight and\ngentleman--my Lord Carnal--my Lord Coward!\"\n\n\"Honor is an empty word to me,\" he answered. \"For you I would dive into\nthe deepest hell,--if there be a deeper than that which burns me, day\nin, day out.... Jocelyn, Jocelyn, Jocelyn!\"\n\n\"You love me so?\" she said. \"Then do me pleasure. Because I ask it of\nyou, tell these men the truth.\" She came a step nearer, and held out her\nclasped hands to him. \"Tell them how it was, my lord, and I will strive\nto hate you no longer. The harm that you have done me I will pray for\nstrength to forgive. Ah, my lord, let me not ask in vain! Will you that\nI kneel to you?\"\n\n\"I fix my own price,\" he said. \"I will do what you ask, an you will let\nme kiss your lips.\"\n\nI sprang forward with an oath. Some one behind caught both my wrists in\nan iron grasp and pulled me back. \"Be not a fool!\" growled Clayborne\nin my ear. \"The cord's loosening fast: if you interfere, it may tighten\nwith a jerk!\" I freed my hands from his grasp. The Treasurer, sitting\nnext him, leaned across the table and motioned to the two seamen beside\nthe window. They left their station, and each seized me by an arm. \"Be\nguided, Captain Percy,\" said Master Sandys in a low voice. \"We wish you\nwell. Let her win you through.\"\n\n\"First tell the truth, my lord,\" said the King's ward; \"then come and\ntake the reward you ask.\"\n\n\"Jocelyn!\" I cried. \"I command you\"--\n\nShe turned upon me a perfectly colorless face. \"All my life after I will\nbe to you an obedient wife,\" she said. \"This once I pray you to hold me\nexcused.... Speak, my lord.\"\n\nThere was the mirth of the lost in the laugh with which he turned to the\nGovernor. \"That pretty little tale, sir, that I regaled you with, the\nday you obligingly picked me up, was pure imagination; the wetting must\nhave disordered my reason. A potion sweeter than the honey of Hybla,\nwhich I am about to drink, hath restored me beforehand. Gentlemen all,\nthere was mutiny aboard that ship which so providentially sank before\nyour very eyes. For why? The crew, who were pirates, and the captain,\nwho was yonder gentleman, did not agree. The one wished to attack\nyou, board you, rummage you, and slay, after recondite fashions, every\nmother's son of you; the other demurred,--so strongly, in fact, that his\nlife ceased to be worth a pin's purchase. Indeed, I believe he resigned\nhis captaincy then and there, and, declining to lift a finger against\nan English ship, defied them to do their worst. He had no hand in the\nfiring of those culverins; the mutineers touched them off without so\nmuch as a 'by your leave.' His attention was otherwise occupied. Good\nsirs, there was not the slightest reason in nature why the ship should\nhave struck upon that sunken reef, to the damnation of her people and\nthe salvation of yours. Why do you suppose she diverged from the path of\nsafety to split into slivers against that fortunate ledge?\"\n\nThe men around drew in their breath, and one or two sprang to their\nfeet. My lord laughed again. \"Have you seen the pious man who\nleft Jamestown and went aboard the pirate ship as this gentleman's\nlieutenant? He hath the strength of a bull. Captain Percy here had but\nto nod his head, and hey, presto! the helmsman was bowled over, and the\nminister had the helm. The ship struck: the pirates went to hell, and\nyou, gentlemen, were preserved to order all things well in Virginia. May\nshe long be grateful! The man who dared that death rather than attack\nthe ship he guessed to be the Company's is my mortal foe, whom I will\nyet sweep from my path, but he is not a pirate. Ay, take it down, an it\nplease you, Master Secretary! I retreat from a most choice position, to\nbe sure, but what care I? I see a vantage ground more to my liking. I\nhave lost a throw, perhaps, but I will recoup ten such losses with one\nsuch kiss. By your leave, lady.\"\n\nHe went up to her where she stood, with hanging arms, her head a little\nbent, white and cold and yielding as a lady done in snow; gazed at her\na moment, with his passion written in his fierce eyes and haggard,\nhandsome face; then crushed her to him.\n\nIf I could have struck him dead, I would have done so. When her word had\nbeen kept, she released herself with a quiet and resolute dignity. As\nfor him, he sank back into the great chair beside the Governor's, leaned\nan elbow on the table, and hid his eyes with one shaking hand.\n\nThe Governor rose to his feet, and motioned away the two seamen who held\nme fast. \"We'll have no hanging this morning, gentlemen,\" he announced.\n\"Captain Percy, I beg to apologize to you for words that were never\nmeant for a brave and gallant gentleman, but for a pirate who I find\ndoes not exist. I pray you to forget them, quite.\"\n\nI returned his bow, but my eyes traveled past him.\n\n\"I will allow you no words with my Lord Carnal,\" he said. \"With your\nwife,--that is different.\" He moved aside with a smile.\n\nShe was standing, pale, with downcast eyes, where my lord had left her.\n\"Jocelyn,\" I said. She turned toward me, crimsoned deeply, uttered a low\ncry, half laughter, half a sob, then covered her face with her hands. I\ntook them away and spoke her name again, and this time she hid her face\nupon my breast.\n\nA moment thus; then--for all eyes were upon her--I lifted her head,\nkissed her, and gave her to Lady Wyatt, whom I found at my side. \"I\ncommend my wife to your ladyship's care,\" I said. \"As you are woman,\ndeal sisterly by her!\"\n\n\"You may trust me, sir,\" she made answer, the tears upon her cheeks. \"I\ndid not know,--I did not understand....Dear heart, come away,--come away\nwith Margaret Wyatt.\"\n\nClayborne opened the door of the cabin, and stood aside with a low bow.\nThe men who had sat to judge me rose; only the King's favorite kept his\nseat. With Lady Wyatt's arm about her, the King's ward passed between\nthe lines of standing gentlemen to the door, there hesitated, turned,\nand, facing them with I know not what of pride and shame, wistfulness of\nentreaty and noble challenge to belief in the face and form that were of\nall women's most beautiful, curtsied to them until her knee touched the\nfloor. She was gone, and the sunlight with her.\n\nWhen I turned upon that shameless lord where he sat in his evil beauty,\nwith his honor dead before him, men came hastily in between. I put\nthem aside with a laugh. I had but wanted to look at him. I had no\nsword,--already he lay beneath my challenge,--and words are weak things.\n\nAt length he rose, as arrogant as ever in his port, as evilly superb in\nhis towering pride, and as amazingly indifferent to the thoughts of men\nwho lied not. \"This case hath wearied me,\" he said. \"I will retire for\na while to rest, and in dreams to live over a past sweetness. Give\nyou good-day, gentles! Sir Francis Wyatt, you will remember that\nthis gentleman did resist arrest, and that he lieth under the King's\ndispleasure!\" So saying he clapped his hat upon his head and walked out\nof the cabin. The Company's officers drew a long breath, as if a fresher\nair had come in with his departure.\n\n\"I have no choice, Captain Percy, but to keep you still under restraint,\nboth here and when we shall reach Jamestown,\" said the Governor. \"All\nthat the Company, through me, can do, consistent with its duty to his\nMajesty, to lighten your confinement shall be done\"--\n\n\"Then send him not again into the hold, Sir Francis!\" exclaimed the\nTreasurer, with a wry face.\n\nThe Governor laughed. \"Lighter and sweeter quarters shall be found. Your\nwife's a brave lady, Captain Percy\"--\n\n\"And a passing fair one,\" said Claybourne under his breath.\n\n\"I left a friend below in the hold, your Honor,\" I said. \"He came with\nme from Jamestown because he was my friend. The King hath never heard\nof him. And he's no more a pirate than I or you, your Honor. He is a\nminister,--a sober, meek, and godly man\"--\n\nFrom behind the Secretary rose the singsong of my acquaintance of the\nhold, Dr. John Pott. \"He is Jeremy, your Honor, Jeremy who made the town\nmerry at Blackfriars. Your Honor remembers him? He had a sickness, and\nforsook the life and went into the country. He was known to the Dean\nof St. Paul's. All the town laughed when it heard that he had taken\norders.\"\n\n\"Jeremy!\" cried out the Treasurer. \"Nick Bottom! Christopher Sly! Sir\nToby Belch! Sir Francis, give me Jeremy to keep in my cabin!\"\n\nThe Governor laughed. \"He shall be bestowed with Captain Percy where\nhe'll not lack for company, I warrant! Jeremy! Ben Jonson loved him;\nthey drank together at the Mermaid.\"\n\nA little later the Treasurer turned to leave my new quarters, to\nwhich he had walked beside me, glanced at the men who waited for him\nwithout,--Jeremy had not yet been brought from the hold,--and returned\nto my side to say, in a low voice, but with emphasis: \"Captain Percy has\nbeen a long time without news from home,--from England. What would he\nmost desire to hear?\"\n\n\"Of the welfare of his Grace of Buckingham,\" I replied.\n\nHe smiled. \"His Grace is as well as heart could desire, and as powerful.\nThe Queen's dog now tuggeth the sow by the ears this way or that, as it\npleaseth him. Since we are not to hang you as a pirate, Captain Percy,\nI incline to think your affairs in better posture than when you left\nVirginia.\"\n\n\"I think so too, sir,\" I said, and gave him thanks for his courtesy, and\nwished him good-day, being anxious to sit still and thank God, with my\nface in my hands and summer in my heart.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII IN WHICH THE SPRINGTIME IS AT HAND\n\n\nTIRED of dicing against myself, and of the books that Rolfe had sent\nme, I betook myself to the gaol window, and, leaning against the bars,\nlooked out in search of entertainment. The nearest if not the merriest\nthing the prospect had to offer was the pillory. It was built so tall\nthat it was but little lower than the low upper story of the gaol, and\nit faced my window at so short a distance that I could hear the long,\nwhistling breath of the wretch who happened to occupy it. It was not a\npleasant sound; neither was a livid face, new branded on the cheek with\na great R, and with a trickle of dark blood from the mutilated ears\nstaining the board in which the head was immovably fixed, a pleasant\nsight. A little to one side was the whipping post: a woman had been\nwhipped that morning, and her cries had tainted the air even more\neffectually than had the decayed matter with which certain small devils\nhad pelted the runaway in the pillory. I looked away from the poor rogue\nbelow me into the clear, hard brightness of the March day, and was most\nheartily weary of the bars between me and it. The wind blew keenly; the\nsky was blue as blue could be, and the river a great ribbon of azure\nsewn with diamonds. All colors were vivid and all distances near. There\nwas no haze over the forest; brown and bare it struck the cloudless\nblue. The marsh was emerald, the green of the pines deep and rich, the\nbudding maples redder than coral. The church, with the low green graves\naround it, appeared not a stone's throw away, and the voices of the\nchildren up and down the street sounded clearly, as though they played\nin the brown square below me. When the drum beat for the nooning the\nroll was close in my ears. The world looked so bright and keen that it\nseemed new made, and the brilliant sunshine and the cold wind stirred\nthe blood like wine.\n\nNow and then men and women passed through the square below. Well-nigh\nall glanced up at the window, and their eyes were friendly. It was\nknown now that Buckingham was paramount at home, and my Lord Carnal's\nfollowing in Virginia was much decayed. Young Hamor strode by, bravely\ndressed and whistling cheerily, and doffed a hat with a most noble\nbroken feather. \"We're going to bait a bear below the fort!\" he called.\n\"Sorry you'll miss the sport! There will be all the world--and my Lord\nCarnal.\" He whistled himself away, and presently there came along\nMaster Edward Sharpless. He stopped and stared at the rogue in the\npillory,--with no prescience, I suppose, of a day when he was to stand\nthere himself; then looked up at me with as much malevolence as his\nsmall soul could write upon his mean features, and passed on. He had a\njaded look; moreover, his clothes were swamp-stained and his cloak had\nbeen torn by briers. \"What did you go to the forest for?\" I muttered.\n\nThe key grated in the door behind me, and it opened to admit the gaoler\nand Diccon with my dinner,--which I was not sorry to see. \"Sir George\nsent the venison, sir,\" said the gaoler, grinning, \"and Master Piersey\nthe wild fowl, and Madam West the pasty and the marchpane, and Master\nPory the sack. Be there anything you lack, sir?\"\n\n\"Nothing that you can supply,\" I answered curtly.\n\nThe fellow grinned again, straightened the things upon the table, and\nstarted for the door. \"You can stay until I come for the platters,\"\nhe said to Diccon, and went out, locking the door after him with\nostentation.\n\nI applied myself to the dinner, and Diccon went to the window, and stood\nthere looking out at the blue sky and at the man in the pillory. He had\nthe freedom of the gaol. I was somewhat more straitly confined, though\nmy friends had easy access to me. As for Jeremy Sparrow, he had spent\ntwenty-four hours in gaol, at the end of which time Madam West had a\nfit of the spleen, declared she was dying, and insisted upon Master\nSparrow's being sent for to administer consolation; Master Bucke,\nunfortunately, having gone up to Henricus on business connected with the\ncollege. From the bedside of that despotic lady Sparrow was called to\nbury a man on the other side of the river, and from the grave to marry\na couple at Mulberry Island. And the next day being Sunday, and no\nminister at hand, he preached again in Master Bucke's pulpit,--and\npreached a sermon so powerful and moving that its like had never been\nheard in Virginia. They marched him not back from the pulpit to gaol.\nThere were but five ministers in Virginia, and there were a many more\nsick to visit and dead to bury. Master Bucke, still feeble in body,\ntarried up river discussing with Thorpe the latter's darling project of\nconverting every imp of an Indian this side the South Sea, and Jeremy\nslipped into his old place. There had been some talk of a public\ncensure, but it died away.\n\nThe pasty and sack disposed of, I turned in my seat and spoke to Diccon:\n\"I looked for Master Rolfe to-day. Have you heard aught of him?\"\n\n\"No,\" he answered. As he spoke, the door was opened and the gaoler put\nin his head. \"A messenger from Master Rolfe, captain.\" He drew back, and\nthe Indian Nantauquas entered the room.\n\nRolfe I had seen twice since the arrival of the George at Jamestown, but\nthe Indian had not been with him. The young chief now came forward and\ntouched the hand I held out to him. \"My brother will be here before the\nsun touches the tallest pine,\" he announced in his grave, calm voice.\n\"He asks Captain Percy to deny himself to any other that may come. He\nwishes to see him alone.\"\n\n\"I shall hardly be troubled with company,\" I said. \"There's a\nbear-baiting toward.\"\n\nNantauquas smiled. \"My brother asked me to find a bear for to-day. I\nbought one from the Paspaheghs for a piece of copper, and took him to\nthe ring below the fort.\"\n\n\"Where all the town will presently be gone,\" I said. \"I wonder what\nRolfe did that for!\"\n\nFilling a cup with sack, I pushed it to the Indian across the table.\n\"You are little in the woods nowadays, Nantauquas.\"\n\nHis fine dark face clouded ever so slightly. \"Opechancanough has dreamt\nthat I am Indian no longer. Singing birds have lied to him, telling him\nthat I love the white man, and hate my own color. He calls me no more\nhis brave, his brother Powhatan's dear son. I do not sit by his council\nfire now, nor do I lead his war bands. When I went last to his lodge and\nstood before him, his eyes burned me like the coals the Monacans once\nclosed my hands upon. He would not speak to me.\"\n\n\"It would not fret me if he never spoke again,\" I said. \"You have been\nto the forest to-day?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he replied, glancing at the smear of leaf mould upon his beaded\nmoccasins. \"Captain Percy's eyes are quick; he should have been an\nIndian. I went to the Paspaheghs to take them the piece of copper. I\ncould tell Captain Percy a curious thing\"--\n\n\"Well?\" I demanded, as he paused.\n\n\"I went to the lodge of the werowance with the copper, and found him not\nthere. The old men declared that he had gone to the weirs for fish,--he\nand ten of his braves. The old men lied. I had passed the weirs of the\nPaspaheghs, and no man was there. I sat and smoked before the lodge, and\nthe maidens brought me chinquapin cakes and pohickory; for Nantauquas\nis a prince and a welcome guest to all save Opechancanough. The old men\nsmoked, with their eyes upon the ground, each seeing only the days when\nhe was even as Nantauquas. They never knew when a wife of the werowance,\nturned child by pride, unfolded a doeskin and showed Nantauquas a silver\ncup carved all over and set with colored stones.\"\n\n\"Humph!\"\n\n\"The cup was a heavy price to pay,\" continued the Indian. \"I do not know\nwhat great thing it bought.\"\n\n\"Humph!\" I said again. \"Did you happen to meet Master Edward Sharpless\nin the forest?\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"The forest is wide, and there are many trails\nthrough it. Nantauquas looked for that of the werowance of the\nPaspaheghs, but found it not. He had no time to waste upon a white man.\"\n\nHe gathered his otterskin mantle about him and prepared to depart. I\nrose and gave him my hand, for I thoroughly liked him, and in the past\nhe had made me his debtor. \"Tell Rolfe he will find me alone,\" I said,\n\"and take my thanks for your pains, Nantauquas. If ever we hunt together\nagain, may I have the chance to serve you! I bear the scars of the\nwolf's teeth yet; you came in the nick of time, that day.\"\n\nThe Indian smiled. \"It was a fierce old wolf. I wish Captain Percy free\nwith all my heart, and then we will hunt more wolves, he and I.\"\n\nWhen he was gone, and the gaoler and Diccon with him, I returned to\nthe window. The runaway in the pillory was released, and went away\nhomewards, staggering beside his master's stirrup. Passers-by grew more\nand more infrequent, and up the street came faint sounds of laughter\nand hurrahing,--the bear must be making good sport. I could see the\nhalf-moon, and the guns, and the flag that streamed in the wind, and on\nthe river a sail or two, white in the sunlight as the gulls that swooped\npast. Beyond rose the bare masts of the George. The Santa Teresa rode\nno more forever in the James. The King's ship was gone home to the King\nwithout the freight he looked for. Three days, and the George would\nspread her white wings and go down the wide river, and I with her, and\nthe King's ward, and the King's sometime favorite. I looked down the\nwind-ruffled stream, and saw the great bay into which it emptied, and\nbeyond the bay the heaving ocean, dark and light, league on league,\nleague on league; then green England, and London, and the Tower. The\nvision disturbed me less than once it would have done. Men that I knew\nand trusted were to be passengers on that ship, as well as one I knew\nand did not trust. And if, at the journey's end, I saw the Tower, I\nsaw also his Grace of Buckingham. Where I hated he hated, and was now\npowerful enough to strike.\n\nThe wind blew from the west, from the unknown. I turned my head, and\nit beat against my forehead, cold and fragrant with the essence of the\nforest,--pine and cedar, dead leaves and black mould, fen and hollow\nand hill,--all the world of woods over which it had passed. The ghost\nof things long dead, which face or voice could never conjure up, will\nsometimes start across our path at the beckoning of an odor. A day in\nthe Starving Time came back to me: how I had dragged myself from our\nbroken palisade and crazy huts, and the groans of the famished and the\nplague-stricken, and the presence of the unburied dead, across the neck\nand into the woods, and had lain down there to die, being taken with a\nsick fear and horror of the place of cannibals behind me; and how weak\nI was!--too weak to care any more. I had been a strong man, and it had\ncome to that, and I was content to let it be. The smell of the woods\nthat day, the chill brown earth beneath me, the blowing wind, the long\nstretch of the river gleaming between the pines,... and fair in sight\nthe white sails of the Patience and the Deliverance.\n\nI had been too nigh gone then to greatly care that I was saved; now I\ncared, and thanked God for my life. Come what might in the future, the\npast was mine. Though I should never see my wife again, I had that hour\nin the state cabin of the George. I loved, and was loved again.\n\nThere was a noise outside the door, and Rolfe's voice speaking to the\ngaoler. Impatient for his entrance I started toward the door, but when\nit opened he made no move to cross the threshold. \"I am not coming in,\"\nhe said, with a face that he strove to keep grave. \"I only came to bring\nsome one else.\" With that he stepped back, and a second figure, coming\nforward out of the dimness behind him, crossed the threshold. It was a\nwoman, cloaked and hooded. The door was drawn to behind her, and we were\nalone together.\n\nBeside the cloak and hood she wore a riding mask. \"Do you know who it\nis?\" she asked, when she had stood, so shrouded, for a long minute,\nduring which I had found no words with which to welcome her.\n\n\"Yea,\" I answered: \"the princess in the fairy tale.\"\n\nShe freed her dark hair from its covering, and unclasping her cloak let\nit drop to the floor. \"Shall I unmask?\" she asked, with a sigh. \"Faith!\nI should keep the bit of silk between your eyes, sir, and my blushes. Am\nI ever to be the forward one? Do you not think me too bold a lady?\" As\nshe spoke, her white hands were busy about the fastening of her mask.\n\"The knot is too hard,\" she murmured, with a little tremulous laugh and\na catch of her breath.\n\nI untied the ribbons.\n\n\"May I not sit down?\" she said plaintively, but with soft merriment in\nher eyes. \"I am not quite strong yet. My heart--you do not know what\npain I have in my heart sometimes. It makes me weep of nights and when\nnone are by, indeed it does!\"\n\nThere was a settle beneath the window. I led her to it, and she sat\ndown.\n\n\"You must know that I am walking in the Governor's garden, that hath\nonly a lane between it and the gaol.\" Her eyes were downcast, her cheeks\npure rose.\n\n\"When did you first love me?\" I demanded.\n\n\"Lady Wyatt must have guessed why Master Rolfe alone went not to the\nbear-baiting, but joined us in the garden. She said the air was keen,\nand fetched me her mask, and then herself went indoors to embroider\nSamson in the arms of Delilah.'\n\n\"Was it here at Jamestown, or was it when we were first wrecked, or on\nthe island with the pink hill when you wrote my name in the sand, or\"--\n\n\"The George will sail in three days, and we are to be taken back to\nEngland after all. It does not scare me now.\"\n\n\"In all my life I have kissed you only once,\" I said.\n\nThe rose deepened, and in her eyes there was laughter, with tears\nbehind. \"You are a gentleman of determination,\" she said. \"If you\nare bent upon having your way, I do not know that I--that I--can help\nmyself. I do not even know that I want to help myself.\"\n\nOutside the wind blew and the sun shone, and the laughter from below the\nfort was too far away and elfin to jar upon us. The world forgot us, and\nwe were well content. There seemed not much to say: I suppose we were\ntoo happy for words. I knelt beside her, and she laid her hands in\nmine, and now and then we spoke. In her short and lonely life, and in my\nlonger stern and crowded one, there had been little tenderness, little\nhappiness. In her past, to those about her, she had seemed bright and\ngay; I had been a comrade whom men liked because I could jest as well as\nfight. Now we were happy, but we were not gay. Each felt for the other a\ngreat compassion; each knew that though we smiled to-day, the groan and\nthe tear might be to-morrow's due; the sunshine around us was pure gold,\nbut that the clouds were mounting we knew full well.\n\n\"I must soon be gone,\" she said at last. \"It is a stolen meeting. I do\nnot know when we shall meet again.\"\n\nShe rose from the settle, and I rose with her, and we stood together\nbeside the barred window. There was no danger of her being seen; street\nand square were left to the wind and the sunshine. My arm was around\nher, and she leaned her head against my breast. \"Perhaps we shall never\nmeet again,\" she said.\n\n\"The winter is over,\" I answered. \"Soon the trees will be green and\nthe flowers in bloom. I will not believe that our spring can have no\nsummer.\"\n\nShe took from her bosom a little flower that had been pinned there. It\nlay, a purple star, in the hollow of her hand. \"It grew in the sun. It\nis the first flower of spring.\" She put it to her lips, then laid\nit upon the window ledge beside my hand. \"I have brought you evil\ngifts,--foes and strife and peril. Will you take this little purple\nflower--and all my heart beside?\"\n\nI bent and kissed first the tiny blossom, and then the lips that had\nproffered it. \"I am very rich,\" I said.\n\nThe sun was now low, and the pines in the square and the upright of the\npillory cast long shadows. The wind had fallen and the sounds had died\naway. It seemed very still. Nothing moved but the creeping shadows until\na flight of small white-breasted birds went past the window. \"The snow\nis gone,\" I said. \"The snowbirds are flying north.\"\n\n\"The woods will soon be green,\" she murmured wistfully. \"Ah, if we could\nride through them once more, back to Weyanoke\"--\n\n\"To home,\" I said.\n\n\"Home,\" she echoed softly.\n\nThere was a low knocking at the door behind us. \"It is Master Rolfe's\nsignal,\" she said. \"I must not stay. Tell me that you love me, and let\nme go.\"\n\nI drew her closer to me and pressed my lips upon her bowed head. \"Do you\nnot know that I love you?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yea,\" she answered. \"I have been taught it. Tell me that you believe\nthat God will be good to us. Tell me that we shall be happy yet; for oh,\nI have a boding heart this day!\"\n\nHer voice broke, and she lay trembling in my arms, her face hidden. \"If\nthe summer never comes for us\"--she whispered. \"Good-by, my lover and my\nhusband. If I have brought you ruin and death, I have brought you, too,\na love that is very great. Forgive me and kiss me, and let me go.\"\n\n\"Thou art my dearly loved and honored wife,\" I said. \"My heart forebodes\nsummer, and joy, and peace, and home.\"\n\nWe kissed each other solemnly, as those who part for a journey and a\nwarfare. I spoke no word to Rolfe when the door was opened and she had\npassed out with her cloak drawn about her face, but we clasped hands,\nand each knew the other for his friend indeed. They were gone, the\ngaoler closing and locking the door behind them. As for me, I went back\nto the settle beneath the window, and, falling on my knees beside it,\nburied my face in my arms.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX IN WHICH I KEEP TRYST\n\n\nTHE sun dropped below the forest, blood red, dyeing the river its own\ncolor. There were no clouds in the sky,--only a great suffusion of\ncrimson climbing to the zenith; against it the woods were as black as\nwar paint. The color faded and the night set in, a night of no wind and\nof numberless stars. On the hearth burned a fire. I left the window and\nsat beside it, and in the hollows between the red embers made pictures,\nas I used to make them when I was a boy.\n\nI sat there long. It grew late, and all sounds in the town were hushed;\nonly now and then the \"All's well!\" of the watch came faintly to my\nears. Diccon lodged with me; he lay in his clothes upon a pallet in the\nfar corner of the room, but whether he slept or not I did not ask. He\nand I had never wasted words; since chance had thrown us together again\nwe spoke only when occasion required.\n\nThe fire was nigh out, and it must have been ten of the clock when, with\nsomewhat more of caution and less of noise than usual, the key grated\nin the lock; the door opened, and the gaoler entered, closing it\nnoiselessly behind him. There was no reason why he should intrude\nhimself upon me after nightfall, and I regarded him with a frown and an\nimpatience that presently turned to curiosity.\n\nHe began to move about the room, making pretense of seeing that there\nwas water in the pitcher beside my pallet, that the straw beneath the\ncoverlet was fresh, that the bars of the window were firm, and ended by\napproaching the fire and heaping pine upon it. It flamed up brilliantly,\nand in the strong red light he half opened a clenched hand and showed\nme two gold pieces, and beneath them a folded paper. I looked at his\nfurtive eyes and brutal, doltish face, but he kept them blank as a wall.\nThe hand closed again over the treasure within it, and he turned away\nas if to leave the room. I drew a noble--one of a small store of gold\npieces conveyed to me by Rolfe--from my pocket, and stooping made it\nspin upon the hearth in the red firelight. The gaoler looked at it\naskance, but continued his progress toward the door. I drew out its\nfellow, set it too to spinning, then leaned back against the table.\n\"They hunt in couples,\" I said. \"There will be no third one.\"\n\nHe had his foot upon them before they had done spinning. The next moment\nthey had kissed the two pieces already in his possession, and he had\ntransferred all four to his pocket. I held out my hand for the paper,\nand he gave it to me grudgingly, with a spiteful slowness of movement.\nHe would have stayed beside me as I read it, but I sternly bade him keep\nhis distance; then kneeling before the fire to get the light, I opened\nthe paper. It was written upon in a delicate, woman's hand, and it ran\nthus:--\n\nAn you hold me dear, come to me at once. Come without tarrying to the\ndeserted hut on the neck of land, nearest to the forest. As you love me,\nas you are my knight, keep this tryst.\n\nIn distress and peril, THY WIFE.\n\nFolded with it was a line in the commander's hand and with his\nsignature: \"The bearer may pass without the palisade at his pleasure.\"\n\nI read the first paper again, refolded it, and rose to my feet. \"Who\nbrought this, sirrah?\" I demanded.\n\nHis answer was glib enough: \"One of the governor's servants. He said as\nhow there was no harm in the letter, and the gold was good.\"\n\n\"When was this?\"\n\n\"Just now. No, I did n't know the man.\"\n\nI saw no way to discover whether or not he lied. Drawing out another\ngold piece, I laid it upon the table. He eyed it greedily, edging nearer\nand nearer.\n\n\"For leaving this door unlocked,\" I said.\n\nHis eyes narrowed and he moistened his lips, shifting from one foot to\nthe other.\n\nI put down a second piece. \"For opening the outer door,\" I said.\n\nHe wet his lips again, made an inarticulate sound in his throat,\nand finally broke out with, \"The commander will nail my ears to the\npillory.\"\n\n\"You can lock the doors after me, and know as little as you choose in\nthe morning. No gain without some risk.\"\n\n\"That's so,\" he agreed, and made a clutch at the gold.\n\nI swept it out of his reach. \"First earn it,\" I said dryly. \"Look at the\nfoot of the pillory an hour from now and you'll find it. I'll not pay\nyou this side of the doors.\"\n\nHe bit his lips and studied the floor. \"You're a gentleman,\" he growled\nat last. \"I suppose I can trust ye.\"\n\n\"I suppose you can.\"\n\nTaking up his lantern he turned toward the door. \"It 's growing late,\"\nhe said, with a most uncouth attempt to feign a guileless drowsiness.\n\"I'll to bed, captain, when I've locked up. Good-night to ye!\"\n\nHe was gone, and the door was left unlocked. I could walk out of that\ngaol as I could have walked out of my house at Weyanoke. I was free, but\nshould I take my freedom? Going back to the light of the fire I unfolded\nthe paper and stared at it, turning its contents this way and that in\nmy mind. The hand--but once had I seen her writing, and then it had been\nwrought with a shell upon firm sand. I could not judge if this were the\nsame. Had the paper indeed come from her? Had it not? If in truth it\nwas a message from my wife, what had befallen in a few hours since our\nparting? If it was a forger's lie, what trap was set, what toils were\nlaid? I walked up and down, and tried to think it out. The strangeness\nof it all, the choice of a lonely and distant hut for trysting place,\nthat pass coming from a sworn officer of the Company, certain things I\nhad heard that day... A trap... and to walk into it with my eyes\nopen.... An you hold me dear. As you are my knight, keep this tryst. In\ndistress and peril.... Come what might, there was a risk I could not run.\n\nI had no weapons to assume, no preparations to make. Gathering up the\ngaoler's gold I started toward the door, opened it, and going out would\nhave closed it softly behind me but that a booted leg thrust across\nthe jamb prevented me. \"I am going with you,\" said Diccon in a guarded\nvoice. \"If you try to prevent me, I will rouse the house.\" His head was\nthrown back in the old way; the old daredevil look was upon his face.\n\"I don't know why you are going,\" he declared, \"but there'll be danger,\nanyhow.\"\n\n\"To the best of my belief I am walking into a trap,\" I said.\n\n\"Then it will shut on two instead of one,\" he answered doggedly.\n\nBy this he was through the door, and there was no shadow of turning on\nhis dark, determined face. I knew my man, and wasted no more words.\nLong ago it had grown to seem the thing most in nature that the hour of\ndanger should find us side by side.\n\nWhen the door of the firelit room was shut, the gaol was in darkness\nthat might be felt. It was very still: the few other inmates were fast\nasleep; the gaoler was somewhere out of sight, dreaming with open\neyes. We groped our way through the passage to the stairs, noiselessly\ndescended them, and found the outer door unchained, unbarred, and\nslightly ajar.\n\nWhen I had laid the gold beneath the pillory, we struck swiftly across\nthe square, being in fear lest the watch should come upon us, and took\nthe first lane that led toward the palisade. Beneath the burning stars\nthe town lay stark in sleep. So bright in the wintry air were those\nfar-away lights that the darkness below them was not great. We could\nsee the low houses, the shadowy pines, the naked oaks, the sandy lane\nglimmering away to the river, star-strewn to match the heavens. The air\nwas cold, but exceedingly clear and still. Now and then a dog barked, or\nwolves howled in the forest across the river. We kept in the shadow\nof the houses and the trees, and went with the swiftness, silence, and\ncaution of Indians.\n\nThe last house we must pass before reaching the palisade was one\nthat Rolfe owned, and in which he lodged when business brought him to\nJamestown. It and some low outbuildings beyond it were as dark as the\ncedars in which they were set, and as silent as the grave. Rolfe and his\nIndian brother were sleeping there now, while I stood without. Or did\nthey sleep? Were they there at all? Might it not have been Rolfe who had\nbribed the gaoler and procured the pass from West? Might I not find him\nat that strange trysting place? Might not all be well, after all? I was\nsorely tempted to rouse that silent house and demand if its master were\nwithin. I did it not. Servants were there, and noise would be made, and\ntime that might be more precious than life-blood was flying fast. I went\non, and Diccon with me.\n\nThere was a cabin built almost against the palisade, and here one man\nwas supposed to watch, whilst another slept. To-night we found both\nasleep. I shook the younger to his feet, and heartily cursed him for his\nnegligence. He listened stupidly, and read as stupidly, by the light of\nhis lantern, the pass which I thrust beneath his nose. Staggering to his\nfeet, and drunk with his unlawful slumber, he fumbled at the fastenings\nof the gate for full three minutes before the ponderous wood finally\nswung open and showed the road beyond. \"It's all right,\" he muttered\nthickly. \"The commander's pass. Good-night, the three of ye!\"\n\n\"Are you drunk or drugged?\" I demanded. \"There are only two. It's not\nsleep that is the matter with you. What is it?\"\n\nHe made no answer, but stood holding the gate open and blinking at us\nwith dull, unseeing eyes. Something ailed him besides sleep; he may have\nbeen drugged, for aught I know. When we had gone some yards from the\ngate, we heard him say again, in precisely the same tone, \"Good-night,\nthe three of ye!\" Then the gate creaked to, and we heard the bars drawn\nacross it.\n\nWithout the palisade was a space of waste land, marsh and thicket,\ntapering to the narrow strip of sand and scrub joining the peninsula to\nthe forest, and here and there upon this waste ground rose a mean house,\ndwelt in by the poorer sort. All were dark. We left them behind, and\nfound ourselves upon the neck, with the desolate murmur of the river on\neither hand, and before us the deep blackness of the forest. Suddenly\nDiccon stopped in his tracks and turned his head. \"I did hear something\nthen,\" he muttered. \"Look, sir!\"\n\nThe stars faintly lit the road that had been trodden hard and bare by\nthe feet of all who came and went. Down this road something was coming\ntoward us, something low and dark, that moved not fast, and not slow,\nbut with a measured and relentless pace. \"A panther!\" said Diccon.\n\nWe watched the creature with more of curiosity than alarm. Unless\nbrought to bay, or hungry, or wantonly irritated, these great cats were\ncowardly enough. It would hardly attack the two of us. Nearer and nearer\nit came, showing no signs of anger and none of fear, and paying no\nattention to the withered branch with which Diccon tried to scare it\noff. When it was so close that we could see the white of its breast it\nstopped, looking at us with large unfaltering eyes, and slightly moving\nits tail to and fro.\n\n\"A tame panther!\" ejaculated Diccon. \"It must be the one Nantauquas\ntamed, sir. He would have kept it somewhere near Master Rolfe's house.\"\n\n\"And it heard us, and followed us through the gate,\" I said. \"It was the\nthird the warder talked of.\"\n\nWe walked on, and the beast, addressing itself to motion, followed at\nour heels. Now and then we looked back at it, but we feared it not.\n\nAs for me, I had begun to think that a panther might be the least\nformidable thing I should meet that night. By this I had scarcely any\nhope--or fear--that I should find her at our journey's end. The lonesome\npath that led only to the night-time forest, the deep and dark river\nwith its mournful voice, the hard, bright, pitiless stars, the cold, the\nloneliness, the distance,--how should she be there? And if not she, who\nthen?\n\nThe hut to which I had been directed stood in an angle made by the neck\nand the main bank of the river. On one side of it was the water, on\nthe other a deep wood. The place had an evil name, and no man had\nlived there since the planter who had built it hanged himself upon its\nthreshold. The hut was ruinous: in the summer tall weeds grew up around\nit, and venomous snakes harbored beneath its rotted and broken floor; in\nthe winter the snow whitened it, and the wild fowl flew screaming in and\nout of the open door and the windows that needed no barring. To-night\nthe door was shut and the windows in some way obscured. But the\ninterstices between the logs showed red; the hut was lighted within, and\nsome one was keeping tryst.\n\nThe stillness was deadly. It was not silence, for the river murmured in\nthe stiff reeds, and far off in the midnight forest some beast of the\nnight uttered its cry, but a hush, a holding of the breath, an expectant\nhorror. The door, warped and shrunken, was drawn to, but was not\nfastened, as I could tell by the unbroken line of red light down one\nside from top to bottom. Making no sound, I laid my hand upon it, pushed\nit open a little way, and looked within the hut.\n\nI had thought to find it empty or to find it crowded. It was neither.\nA torch lit it, and on the hearth burned a fire. Drawn in front of the\nblaze was an old rude chair, and in it sat a slight figure draped from\nhead to foot in a black cloak. The head was bowed and hidden, the whole\nattitude one of listlessness and dejection. As I looked, there came a\nlong tremulous sigh, and the head drooped lower and lower, as if in a\ngrowing hopelessness.\n\nThe revulsion of feeling was so great that for the moment I was dazed as\nby a sudden blow. There had been time during the walk from the gaol for\nenough of wild and whirling thoughts as to what should greet me in that\nhut; and now the slight figure by the fire, the exquisite melancholy of\nits posture, its bent head, the weeping I could divine,--I had but one\nthought, to comfort her as quickly as I might. Diccon's hand was upon\nmy arm, but I shook it off, and pushing the door open crossed the uneven\nand noisy floor to the fire, and bent over the lonely figure beside it.\n\"Jocelyn,\" I said, \"I have kept tryst.\"\n\nAs I spoke, I laid my hand upon the bowed and covered head. It was\nraised, the cloak was drawn aside, and there looked me in the eyes the\nItalian.\n\nAs if it had been the Gorgon's gaze, I was turned to stone. The filmy\neyes, the smile that would have been mocking had it not been so very\nfaint, the pallor, the malignance,--I stared and stared, and my heart\ngrew cold and sick.\n\nIt was but for a minute; then a warning cry from Diccon roused me. I\nsprang backward until the width of the hearth was between me and the\nItalian, then wheeled and found myself face to face with the King's late\nfavorite. Behind him was an open door, and beyond it a small inner room,\ndimly lighted. He stood and looked at me with an insolence and a triumph\nmost intolerable. His drawn sword was in his hand, the jeweled hilt\nblazing in the firelight, and on his dark, superb face a taunting smile.\nI met it with one as bold, at least, but I said no word, good or bad.\nIn the cabin of the George I had sworn to myself that thenceforward my\nsword should speak for me to this gentleman.\n\n\"You came,\" he said. \"I thought you would.\"\n\nI glanced around the hut, seeking for a weapon. Seeing nothing more\npromising than the thick, half-consumed torch, I sprang to it and\nwrested it from the socket. Diccon caught up a piece of rusted iron from\nthe hearth, and together we faced my lord's drawn sword and a small,\nsharp, and strangely shaped dagger that the Italian drew from a velvet\nsheath.\n\nMy lord laughed, reading my thoughts. \"You are mistaken,\" he declared\ncoolly. \"I am content that Captain Percy knows I do not fear to fight\nhim. This time I play to win.\" Turning toward the outer door, he raised\nhis hand with a gesture of command.\n\nIn an instant the room was filled. The red-brown figures, naked save for\nthe loincloth and the headdress, the impassive faces dashed with black,\nthe ruthless eyes--I knew now why Master Edward Sharpless had gone to\nthe forest, and what service had been bought with that silver cup. The\nPaspaheghs and I were old enemies; doubtless they would find their task\na pleasant one.\n\n\"My own knaves, unfortunately, were out of the way; sent home on the\nSanta Teresa,\" said my lord, still smiling. \"I am not yet so poor that I\ncannot hire others. True, Nicolo might have done the work just now, when\nyou bent over him so lovingly and spoke so softly; but the river might\ngive up your body to tell strange tales. I have heard that the Indians\nare more ingenious, and leave no such witness anywhere.\"\n\nBefore the words were out of his mouth I had sprung upon him, and had\ncaught him by the sword wrist and the throat. He strove to free his\nhand, to withdraw himself from my grasp. Locked together, we struggled\nbackward and forward in what seemed a blaze of lights and a roaring as\nof mighty waters. Red hands caught at me, sharp knives panted to drink\nmy blood; but so fast we turned and writhed, now he uppermost, now I,\nthat for very fear of striking the wrong man hands and knives could not\nbe bold. I heard Diccon fighting, and knew that there would be howling\ntomorrow among the squaws of the Paspaheghs. With all his might my lord\nstrove to bend the sword against me, and at last did cut me across the\narm, causing the blood to flow freely. It made a pool upon the floor,\nand once my foot slipped in it, and I stumbled and almost fell.\n\nTwo of the Paspaheghs were silent for evermore. Diccon had the knife of\nthe first to fall, and it ran red. The Italian, quick and sinuous as a\nserpent, kept beside my lord and me, striving to bring his dagger to his\nmaster's aid. We two panted hard; before our eyes blood, within our ears\nthe sea. The noise of the other combatants suddenly fell. The hush could\nonly mean that Diccon was dead or taken. I could not look behind to\nsee. With an access of fury I drove my antagonist toward a corner of the\nhut,--the corner, so it chanced, in which the panther had taken up its\nquarters. With his heel he struck the beast out of his way, then made\na last desperate effort to throw me. I let him think he was about to\nsucceed, gathered my forces and brought him crashing to the ground. The\nsword was in my hand and shortened, the point was at his throat, when my\narm was jerked backwards. A moment, and half a dozen hands had dragged\nme from the man beneath me, and a supple savage had passed a thong of\ndeerskin around my arms and pinioned them to my sides. The game was up;\nthere remained only to pay the forfeit without a grimace.\n\nDiccon was not dead; pinioned, like myself, and breathing hard, he\nleaned sullenly against the wall, they that he had slain at his feet.\nMy lord rose, and stood over against me. His rich doublet was torn and\ndragged away at the neck, and my blood stained his hand and arm. A smile\nwas upon the face that had made him master of a kingdom's master.\n\n\"The game was long,\" he said, \"but I have won at last. A long good-night\nto you, Captain Percy, and a dreamless sleep!\"\n\nThere was a swift backward movement of the Indians, and a loud \"The\npanther, sir! Have a care!\" from Diccon. I turned. The panther, maddened\nby the noise and light, the shifting figures, the blocked doors, the\nsight and smell of blood, the blow that had been dealt it, was crouching\nfor a spring. The red-brown hair was bristling, the eyes were terrible.\nI was before it, but those glaring eyes had marked me not. It passed me\nlike a bar from a catapult, and the man whose heel it had felt was full\nin its path. One of its forefeet sank in the velvet of the doublet;\nthe claws of the other entered the flesh below the temple, and tore\ndownwards and across. With a cry as awful as the panther's scream the\nItalian threw himself upon the beast and buried his poniard in its neck.\nThe panther and the man it had attacked went down together.\n\nWhen the Indians had unlocked that dread embrace and had thrust aside\nthe dead brute, there emerged from the dimness of the inner room Master\nEdward Sharpless, gray with fear, trembling in every limb, to take the\nreins that had fallen from my lord's hands. The King's minion lay in\nhis blood, a ghastly spectacle; unconscious now, but with life before\nhim,--life through which to pass a nightmare vision. The face out of\nwhich had looked that sullen, proud, and wicked spirit had been one\nof great beauty; it had brought him exceeding wealth and power beyond\nmeasure; the King had loved to look upon it; and it had come to this. He\nlived, and I was to die: better my death than his life. In every heart\nthere are dark depths, whence at times ugly things creep into the\ndaylight; but at least I could drive back that unmanly triumph, and bid\nit never come again. I would have killed him, but I would not have had\nhim thus.\n\nThe Italian was upon his knees beside his master: even such a creature\ncould love. From his skeleton throat came a low, prolonged, croaking\nsound, and his bony hands strove to wipe away the blood. The Paspaheghs\ndrew around us closer and closer, and the werowance clutched me by the\nshoulder. I shook him off. \"Give the word, Sharpless,\" I said, \"or nod,\nif thou art too frightened to speak. Murder is too stern a stuff for\nsuch a base kitchen knave as thou to deal in.\"\n\nWhite and shaking, he would not meet my eyes, but beckoned the werowance\nto him, and began to whisper vehemently; pointing now to the man upon\nthe floor, now to the town, now to the forest. The Indian listened,\nnodded, and glided back to his fellows.\n\n\"The white men upon the Powhatan are many,\" he said in his own tongue,\n\"but they build not their wigwams upon the banks of the Pamunkey. 1 The\nsinging birds of the Pamunkey tell no tales. The pine splinters will\nburn as brightly there, and the white men will smell them not. We will\nbuild a fire at Uttamussac, between the red hills, before the temple and\nthe graves of the kings.\" There was a murmur of assent from his braves.\n\nUttamussac! They would probably make a two days' journey of it. We had\nthat long, then, to live.\n\nCaptors and captives, we presently left the hut. On the threshold I\nlooked back, past the poltroon whom I had flung into the river one\nmidsummer day, to that prone and bleeding figure. As I looked, it\ngroaned and moved. The Indians behind me forced me on; a moment, and\nwe were out beneath the stars. They shone so very brightly; there was\none--large, steadfast, golden--just over the dark town behind us, over\nthe Governor's house. Did she sleep or did she wake? Sleeping or waking,\nI prayed God to keep her safe and give her comfort. The stars now shone\nthrough naked branches, black tree trunks hemmed us round, and under our\nfeet was the dreary rustling of dead leaves. The leafless trees gave\nway to pines and cedars, and the closely woven, scented roof hid the\nheavens, and made a darkness of the world beneath.\n\n     1. The modern York.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX IN WHICH WE START UPON A JOURNEY\n\n\nWHEN the dawn broke, it found us traveling through a narrow\nvalley, beside a stream of some width. Upon its banks grew trees of\nextraordinary height and girth; cypress and oak and walnut, they towered\ninto the air, their topmost branches stark and black against the roseate\nheavens. Below that iron tracery glowed the firebrands of the maples,\nand here and there a willow leaned a pale green cloud above the stream.\nMist closed the distances; we could hear, but not see, the deer where\nthey stood to drink in the shallow places, or couched in the gray and\ndreamlike recesses of the forest.\n\nSpectral, unreal, and hollow seems the world at dawn. Then, if ever, the\nheart sickens and the will flags, and life becomes a pageant that hath\nceased to entertain. As I moved through the mist and the silence, and\nfelt the tug of the thong that bound me to the wrist of the savage who\nstalked before me, I cared not how soon they made an end, seeing how\nstale and unprofitable were all things under the sun.\n\nDiccon, walking behind me, stumbled over a root and fell upon his knees,\ndragging down with him the Indian to whom he was tied. In a sudden\naccess of fury, aggravated by the jeers with which his fellows greeted\nhis mishap, the savage turned upon his prisoner and would have stuck\na knife into him, bound and helpless as he was, had not the werowance\ninterfered. The momentary altercation over, and the knife restored\nto its owner's belt, the Indians relapsed into their usual menacing\nsilence, and the sullen march was resumed. Presently the stream made a\nsharp bend across our path, and we forded it as best we might. It ran\ndark and swift, and the water was of icy coldness. Beyond, the woods\nhad been burnt, the trees rising from the red ground like charred and\nblackened stakes, with the ghostlike mist between. We left this dismal\ntract behind, and entered a wood of mighty oaks, standing well apart,\nand with the earth below carpeted with moss and early wild flowers. The\nsun rose, the mist vanished, and there set in the March day of keen wind\nand brilliant sunshine.\n\nFarther on, an Indian bent his bow against a bear shambling across a\nlittle sunny glade. The arrow did its errand, and where the creature\nfell, there we sat down and feasted beside a fire kindled by rubbing two\nsticks together. According to their wont the Indians ate ravenously, and\nwhen the meal was ended began to smoke, each warrior first throwing\ninto the air, as thank-offering to Kiwassa, a pinch of tobacco. They all\nstared at the fire around which we sat, and the silence was unbroken.\nOne by one, as the pipes were smoked, they laid themselves down upon\nthe brown leaves and went to sleep, only our two guardians and a third\nIndian over against us remaining wide-eyed and watchful.\n\nThere was no hope of escape, and we entertained no thought of it. Diccon\nsat, biting his nails, staring into the fire, and I stretched myself\nout, and burying my head in my arms tried to sleep, but could not.\n\nWith the midday we were afoot again, and we went steadily on through the\nbright afternoon. We met with no harsh treatment other than our bonds.\nInstead, when our captors spoke to us, it was with words of amity and\nsmiling lips. Who accounteth for Indian fashions? It is a way they\nhave, to flatter and caress the wretch for whom have been provided the\ntorments of the damned. If, when at sunset we halted for supper and\ngathered around the fire, the werowance began to tell of a foray I had\nled against the Paspaheghs years before, and if he and his warriors, for\nall the world like generous foes, loudly applauded some daring that had\naccompanied that raid, none the less did the red stake wait for us; none\nthe less would they strive, as for heaven, to wring from us groans and\ncries.\n\nThe sun sank, and the darkness entered the forest. In the distance we\nheard the wolves, so the fire was kept up through the night. Diccon and\nI were tied to trees, and all the savages save one lay down and slept. I\nworked awhile at my bonds; but an Indian had tied them, and after a time\nI desisted from the useless labor. We two could have no speech together;\nthe fire was between us, and we saw each other but dimly through the\nflame and wreathing smoke,--as each might see the other to-morrow. What\nDiccon's thoughts were I know not; mine were not of the morrow.\n\nThere had been no rain for a long time, and the multitude of leaves\nunderfoot were crisp and dry. The wind was loud in them and in the\nswaying trees. Off in the forest was a bog, and the will-o'-the-wisps\ndanced over it,--pale, cold flames, moving aimlessly here and there like\nghosts of those lost in the woods. Toward the middle of the night some\nheavy animal crashed through a thicket to the left of us, and tore away\ninto the darkness over the loud-rustling leaves; and later on wolves'\neyes gleamed from out the ring of darkness beyond the firelight. Far on\nin the night the wind fell and the moon rose, changing the forest into\nsome dim, exquisite, far-off land, seen only in dreams. The Indians\nawoke silently and all at once, as at an appointed hour. They spoke for\na while among themselves; then we were loosed from the trees, and the\nwalk toward death began anew.\n\nOn this march the werowance himself stalked beside me, the moonlight\nwhitening his dark limbs and relentless face. He spoke no word, nor did\nI deign to question or reason or entreat. Alike in the darkness of the\ndeep woods, and in the silver of the glades, and in the long twilight\nstretches of sassafras and sighing grass, there was for me but one\nvision. Slender and still and white, she moved before me, with her wide\ndark eyes upon my face. Jocelyn! Jocelyn!\n\nAt sunrise the mist lifted from a low hill before us, and showed an\nIndian boy, painted white, poised upon the summit, like a spirit about\nto take its flight. He prayed to the One over All, and his voice came\ndown to us pure and earnest. At sight of us he bounded down the hillside\nlike a ball, and would have rushed away into the forest had not a\nPaspahegh starting out of line seized him and set him in our midst,\nwhere he stood, cool and undismayed, a warrior in miniature. He was\nof the Pamunkeys, and his tribe and the Paspaheghs were at peace;\ntherefore, when he saw the totem burnt upon the breast of the werowance,\nhe became loquacious enough, and offered to go before us to his village,\nupon the banks of a stream, some bowshots away. He went, and the\nPaspaheghs rested under the trees until the old men of the village\ncame forth to lead them through the brown fields and past the ring of\nleafless mulberries to the strangers' lodge. Here on the green turf mats\nwere laid for the visitors, and water was brought for their hands. Later\non, the women spread a great breakfast of fish and turkey and venison,\nmaize bread, tuckahoe and pohickory. When it was eaten, the Paspaheghs\nranged themselves in a semicircle upon the grass, the Pamunkeys faced\nthem, and each warrior and old man drew out his pipe and tobacco pouch.\nThey smoked gravely, in a silence broken only by an occasional slow and\nstately question or compliment. The blue incense from the pipes mingled\nwith the sunshine falling freely through the bare branches; the stream\nwhich ran by the lodge rippled and shone, and the wind rose and fell in\nthe pines upon its farther bank.\n\nDiccon and I had been freed for the time from our bonds, and placed in\nthe centre of this ring, and when the Indians raised their eyes from the\nground it was to gaze steadfastly at us. I knew their ways, and how\nthey valued pride, indifference, and a bravado disregard of the worst an\nenemy could do. They should not find the white man less proud than the\nsavage.\n\nThey gave us readily enough the pipes I asked for. Diccon lit one and\nI the other, and sitting side by side we smoked in a contentment as\nabsolute as the Indians' own. With his eyes upon the werowance, Diccon\ntold an old story of a piece of Paspahegh villainy and of the payment\nwhich the English exacted, and I laughed as at the most amusing thing in\nthe world. The story ended, we smoked with serenity for a while; then I\ndrew my dice from my pocket, and, beginning to throw, we were at once as\nmuch absorbed in the game as if there were no other stake in the world\nbeside the remnant of gold that I piled between us. The strange people\nin whose power we found ourselves looked on with grim approval, as at\nbrave men who could laugh in Death's face.\n\nThe sun was high in the heavens when we bade the Pamunkeys farewell. The\ncleared ground, the mulberry trees, and the grass beneath, the few rude\nlodges with the curling smoke above them, the warriors and women and\nbrown naked children,--all vanished, and the forest closed around us.\nA high wind was blowing, and the branches far above beat at one another\nfuriously, while the pendent, leafless vines swayed against us, and the\ndead leaves went past in the whirlwind. A monstrous flight of pigeons\ncrossed the heavens, flying from west to east, and darkening the land\nbeneath like a transient cloud. We came to a plain covered with very\ntall trees that had one and all been ringed by the Indians. Long dead,\nand partially stripped of the bark, with their branches, great and\nsmall, squandered upon the ground, they stood, gaunt and silver gray,\nready for their fall. As we passed, the wind brought two crashing to\nthe earth. In the centre of the plain something--deer or wolf or bear or\nman--lay dead, for to that point the buzzards were sweeping from every\nquarter of the blue. Beyond was a pine wood, silent and dim, with a high\ngreen roof and a smooth and scented floor. We walked through it for an\nhour, and it led us to the Pamunkey. A tiny village, counting no more\nthan a dozen warriors, stood among the pines that ran to the water's\nedge, and tied to the trees that shadowed the slow-moving flood were\nits canoes. When the people came forth to meet us, the Paspaheghs bought\nfrom them, for a string of roanoke, two of these boats; and we made no\ntarrying, but, embarking at once, rowed up river toward Uttamussac and\nits three temples.\n\nDiccon and I were placed in the same canoe. We were not bound: what\nneed of bonds, when we had no friend nearer than the Powhatan, and\nwhen Uttamussac was so near? After a time the paddles were put into our\nhands, and we were required to row while our captors rested. There was\nno use in sulkiness; we laughed as at some huge jest, and bent to the\ntask with a will that sent our canoe well in advance of its mate. Diccon\nburst into an old song that we had sung in the Low Countries, by camp\nfires, on the march, before the battle. The forest echoed to the loud\nand warlike tune, and a multitude of birds rose startled from the trees\nupon the bank. The Indians frowned, and one in the boat behind called\nout to strike the singer upon the mouth; but the werowance shook his\nhead. There were none upon that river who might not know that the\nPaspaheghs journeyed to Uttamussac with prisoners in their midst. Diccon\nsang on, his head thrown back, the old bold laugh in his eyes. When he\ncame to the chorus I joined my voice to his, and the woodland rang\nto the song. A psalm had better befitted our lips than those rude and\nvaunting words, seeing that we should never sing again upon this earth;\nbut at least we sang bravely and gayly, with minds that were reasonably\nquiet.\n\nThe sun dropped low in the heavens, and the trees cast shadows across\nthe water. The Paspaheghs now began to recount the entertainment they\nmeant to offer us in the morning. All those tortures that they were\nwont to practice with hellish ingenuity they told over, slowly and\ntauntingly, watching to see a lip whiten or an eyelid quiver. They\nboasted that they would make women of us at the stake. At all events,\nthey made not women of us beforehand. We laughed as we rowed, and Diccon\nwhistled to the leaping fish, and the fish-hawk, and the otter lying\nalong a fallen tree beneath the bank.\n\nThe sunset came, and the river lay beneath the colored clouds like\nmolten gold, with the gaunt forest black upon either hand. From the\nlifted paddles the water showered in golden drops. The wind died away,\nand with it all noises, and a dank stillness settled upon the flood and\nupon the endless forest. We were nearing Uttamussac, and the Indians\nrowed quietly, with bent heads and fearful glances; for Okee brooded\nover this place, and he might be angry. It grew colder and stiller, but\nthe light dwelt in the heavens, and was reflected in the bosom of the\nriver. The trees upon the southern bank were all pines; as if they had\nbeen carved from black stone they stood rigid against the saffron sky.\nPresently, back from the shore, there rose before us a few small hills,\ntreeless, but covered with some low, dark growth. The one that stood\nthe highest bore upon its crest three black houses shaped like coffins.\nBehind them was the deep yellow of the sunset.\n\nAn Indian rowing in the second canoe commenced a chant or prayer to\nOkee. The notes were low and broken, unutterably wild and melancholy.\nOne by one his fellows took up the strain; it swelled higher, louder,\nand sterner, became a deafening cry, then ceased abruptly, making the\nstillness that followed like death itself. Both canoes swung round from\nthe middle stream and made for the bank. When the boats had slipped from\nthe stripe of gold into the inky shadow of the pines, the Paspaheghs\nbegan to divest themselves of this or that which they conceived Okee\nmight desire to possess. One flung into the stream a handful of copper\nlinks, another the chaplet of feathers from his head, a third a bracelet\nof blue beads. The werowance drew out the arrows from a gaudily painted\nand beaded quiver, stuck them into his belt, and dropped the quiver into\nthe water.\n\nWe landed, dragging the canoes into a covert of overhanging bushes and\nfastening them there; then struck through the pines toward the rising\nground, and presently came to a large village, with many long huts,\nand a great central lodge where dwelt the emperors when they came to\nUttamussac. It was vacant now, Opechancanough being no man knew where.\n\nWhen the usual stately welcome had been extended to the Paspaheghs, and\nwhen they had returned as stately thanks, the werowance began a harangue\nfor which I furnished the matter. When he ceased to speak a great\nacclamation and tumult arose, and I thought they would scarce wait for\nthe morrow. But it was late, and their werowance and conjurer restrained\nthem. In the end the men drew off, and the yelling of the children\nand the passionate cries of the women, importunate for vengeance,\nwere stilled. A guard was placed around the vacant lodge, and we two\nEnglishmen were taken within and bound down to great logs, such as the\nIndians use to roll against their doors when they go from home.\n\nThere was revelry in the village; for hours after the night came,\neverywhere were bright firelight and the rise and fall of laughter and\nsong. The voices of the women were musical, tender, and plaintive, and\nyet they waited for the morrow as for a gala day. I thought of a woman\nwho used to sing, softly and sweetly, in the twilight at Weyanoke, in\nthe firelight at the minister's house. At last the noises ceased, the\nlight died away, and the village slept beneath a heaven that seemed\nsomewhat deaf and blind.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI IN WHICH NANTAUQUAS COMES TO OUR RESCUE\n\n\nA MAN who hath been a soldier and an adventurer into far and strange\ncountries must needs have faced Death many times and in many guises. I\nhad learned to know that grim countenance, and to have no great fear of\nit. And beneath the ugliness of the mask that now presented itself there\nwas only Death at last. I was no babe to whimper at a sudden darkness,\nto cry out against a curtain that a Hand chose to drop between me and\nthe life I had lived. Death frighted me not, but when I thought of one\nwhom I should leave behind me I feared lest I should go mad. Had this\nthing come to me a year before, I could have slept the night through;\nnow--now--I lay, bound to the log, before the open door of the lodge,\nand, looking through it, saw the pines waving in the night wind and the\ngleam of the river beneath the stars, and saw her as plainly as though\nshe had stood there under the trees, in a flood of noon sunshine. Now\nshe was the Jocelyn Percy of Weyanoke, now of the minister's house, now\nof a storm-tossed boat and a pirate ship, now of the gaol at Jamestown.\nOne of my arms was free; I could take from within my doublet the little\npurple flower, and drop my face upon the hand that held it. The bloom\nwas quite withered, and scalding tears would not give it life again.\n\nThe face that was, now gay, now defiant, now pale and suffering, became\nsteadfastly the face that had leaned upon my breast in the Jamestown\ngaol, and looked at me with a mournful brightness of love and sorrow.\nSpring was in the land, and the summer would come, but not to us. I\nstretched forth my hand to the wife who was not there, and my heart lay\ncrushed within me. She had been my wife not a year; it was but the other\nday that I knew she loved me--\n\nAfter a while the anguish lessened, and I lay, dull and hopeless,\nthinking of trifling things, counting the stars between the pines.\nAnother slow hour, and, a braver mood coming upon me, I thought of\nDiccon, who was in that plight because of me, and spoke to him, asking\nhim how he did. He answered from the other side of the lodge, but the\nwords were scarcely out of his mouth before our guard broke in upon us\ncommanding silence. Diccon cursed them, whereupon a savage struck him\nacross the head with the handle of a tomahawk, stunning him for a time.\nAs soon as I heard him move I spoke again, to know if he were much hurt;\nwhen he had answered in the negative we said no more.\n\nIt was now moonlight without the lodge and very quiet. The night was\nfar gone; already we could smell the morning, and it would come apace.\nKnowing the swiftness of that approach, and what the early light would\nbring, I strove for a courage which should be the steadfastness of the\nChristian, and not the vainglorious pride of the heathen. If my thoughts\nwandered, if her face would come athwart the verses I tried to remember,\nthe prayer I tried to frame, perhaps He who made her lovely understood\nand forgave. I said the prayer I used to say when I was a child, and\nwished with all my heart for Jeremy.\n\nSuddenly, in the first gray dawn, as at a trumpet's call, the village\nawoke. From the long, communal houses poured forth men, women, and\nchildren; fires sprang up, dispersing the mist, and a commotion arose\nthrough the length and breadth of the place. The women made haste with\ntheir cooking, and bore maize cakes and broiled fish to the warriors who\nsat on the ground in front of the royal lodge. Diccon and I were loosed,\nbrought without, and allotted our share of the food. We ate sitting side\nby side with our captors, and Diccon, with a great cut across his head,\nseized the Indian girl who brought him his platter of fish, and pulling\nher down beside him kissed her soundly, whereat the maid seemed not ill\npleased and the warriors laughed.\n\nIn the usual order of things, the meal over, tobacco should have\nfollowed. But now not a pipe was lit, and the women made haste to take\naway the platters and to get all things in readiness. The werowance of\nthe Paspaheghs rose to his feet, cast aside his mantle, and began to\nspeak. He was a man in the prime of life, of a great figure, strong as\na Susquehannock, and a savage cruel and crafty beyond measure. Over his\nbreast, stained with strange figures, hung a chain of small bones, and\nthe scalp locks of his enemies fringed his moccasins. His tribe being\nthe nearest to Jamestown, and in frequent altercation with us, I had\nheard him speak many times, and knew his power over the passions of his\npeople. No player could be more skillful in gesture and expression, no\npoet more nice in the choice of words, no general more quick to raise\na wild enthusiasm in the soldiers to whom he called. All Indians are\neloquent, but this savage was a leader among them.\n\nHe spoke now to some effect. Commencing with a day in the moon of\nblossoms when for the first time winged canoes brought white men into\nthe Powhatan, he came down through year after year to the present hour,\nceased, and stood in silence, regarding his triumph. It was complete. In\nits wild excitement the village was ready then and there to make an\nend of us who had sprung to our feet and stood with our backs against\na great bay tree, facing the maddened throng. So much the best for us\nwould it be if the tomahawks left the hands that were drawn back to\nthrow, if the knives that were flourished in our faces should be buried\nto the haft in our hearts, that we courted death, striving with word\nand look to infuriate our executioners to the point of forgetting their\nformer purpose in the lust for instant vengeance. It was not to be. The\nwerowance spoke again, pointing to the hills with the black houses upon\nthem, dimly seen through the mist. A moment, and the hands clenched upon\nthe weapons fell; another, and we were upon the march.\n\nAs one man, the village swept through the forest toward the rising\nground that was but a few bowshots away. The young men bounded ahead to\nmake preparation; but the approved warriors and the old men went more\nsedately, and with them walked Diccon and I, as steady of step as they.\nThe women and children for the most part brought up the rear, though\na few impatient hags ran past us, calling the men tortoises who would\nnever reach the goal. One of these women bore a great burning torch, the\nflame and smoke streaming over her shoulder as she ran. Others carried\npieces of bark heaped with the slivers of pine of which every wigwam has\nstore.\n\nThe sun was yet to rise when we reached a hollow amongst the low red\nhills. Above us were the three long houses in which they keep the image\nof Okee and the mummies of their kings. These temples faced the crimson\neast, and the mist was yet about them. Hideous priests, painted over\nwith strange devices, the stuffed skins of snakes knotted about their\nheads, in their hands great rattles which they shook vehemently, rushed\nthrough the doors and down the bank to meet us, and began to dance\naround us, contorting their bodies, throwing up their arms, and making a\nhellish noise. Diccon stared at them, shrugged his shoulders, and with\na grunt of contempt sat down upon a fallen tree to watch the enemy's\nmanoeuvres.\n\nThe place was a natural amphitheatre, well fitted for a spectacle. Those\nIndians who could not crowd into the narrow level spread themselves over\nthe rising ground, and looked down with fierce laughter upon the driving\nof the stakes which the young men brought. The women and children\nscattered into the woods beyond the cleft between the hills, and\nreturned bearing great armfuls of dry branches. The hollow rang to the\nexultation of the playgoers. Taunting laughter, cries of savage triumph,\nthe shaking of the rattles, and the furious beating of two great drums\ncombined to make a clamor deafening to stupor. And above the hollow was\nthe angry reddening of the heavens, and the white mist curling up like\nsmoke.\n\nI sat down beside Diccon on the log. Beneath it there were growing\ntufts of a pale blue, slender-stemmed flower. I plucked a handful of the\nblossoms, and thought how blue they would look against the whiteness of\nher hand; then dropped them in a sudden shame that in that hour I was so\nlittle steadfast to things which were not of earth. I did not speak to\nDiccon, nor he to me. There seemed no need of speech. In the pandemonium\nto which the world had narrowed, the one familiar, matter-of-course\nthing was that he and I were to die together.\n\nThe stakes were in the ground and painted red, the wood properly\narranged. The Indian woman who held the torch that was to light the pile\nran past us, whirling the wood around her head to make it blaze more\nfiercely. As she went by she lowered the brand and slowly dragged it\nacross my wrists. The beating of the drums suddenly ceased, and the\nloud voices died away. To Indians no music is so sweet as the cry of an\nenemy; if they have wrung it from a brave man who has striven to endure,\nso much the better. They were very still now, because they would not\nlose so much as a drawing in of the breath.\n\nSeeing that they were coming for us, Diccon and I rose to await them.\nWhen they were nearly upon us I turned to him and held out my hand.\n\nHe made no motion to take it. Instead he stood with fixed eyes looking\npast me and slightly upwards. A sudden pallor had overspread the\nbronze of his face. \"There's a verse somewhere,\" he said in a quiet\nvoice,--\"it's in the Bible, I think,--I heard it once long ago, before I\nwas lost: 'I will look unto the hills from whence cometh my help'--Look,\nsir!\"\n\nI turned and followed with my eyes the pointing of his finger. In front\nof us the bank rose steeply, bare to the summit,--no trees, only the red\nearth, with here and there a low growth of leafless bushes. Behind it\nwas the eastern sky. Upon the crest, against the sunrise, stood the\nfigure of a man,--an Indian. From one shoulder hung an otterskin, and\na great bow was in his hand. His limbs were bare, and as he stood\nmotionless, bathed in the rosy light, he looked like some bronze god,\nperfect from the beaded moccasins to the calm, uneager face below the\nfeathered headdress. He had but just risen above the brow of the hill;\nthe Indians in the hollow saw him not.\n\nWhile Diccon and I stared our tormentors were upon us. They came a dozen\nor more at once, and we had no weapons. Two hung upon my arms, while a\nthird laid hold of my doublet to rend it from me. An arrow whistled over\nour heads and stuck into a tree behind us. The hands that clutched\nme dropped, and with a yell the busy throng turned their faces in the\ndirection whence had come the arrow.\n\nThe Indian who had sent that dart before him was descending the bank. An\ninstant's breathless hush while they stared at the solitary figure; then\nthe dark forms bent forward for the rush straightened, and there arose a\nloud cry of recognition. \"The son of Powhatan! The son of Powhatan!\"\n\nHe came down the hillside to the level of the hollow, the authority of\nhis look and gesture making way for him through the crowd that surged\nthis way and that, and walked up to us where we stood, hemmed round,\nbut no longer in the clutch of our enemies. \"It was a very big wolf this\ntime, Captain Percy,\" he said.\n\n\"You were never more welcome, Nantauquas,\" I answered,--\"unless, indeed,\nthe wolf intends making a meal of three instead of two.\"\n\nHe smiled. \"The wolf will go hungry to-day.\" Taking my hand in his he\nturned to his frowning countrymen. \"Men of the Pamunkeys!\" he cried.\n\"This is Nantauquas' friend, and so the friend of all the tribes that\ncalled Powhatan 'father.' The fire is not for him nor for his servant;\nkeep it for the Monacans and for the dogs of the Long House! The calumet\nis for the friend of Nantauquas, and the dance of the maidens, the\nnoblest buck and the best of the weirs\"--\n\nThere was a surging forward of the Indians, and a fierce murmur of\ndissent. The werowance, standing out from the throng, lifted his voice.\n\"There was a time,\" he cried, \"when Nantauquas was the panther crouched\nupon the bough above the leader of the herd; now Nantauquas is a tame\npanther and rolls at the white men's feet! There was a time when the\nword of the son of Powhatan weighed more than the lives of many dogs\nsuch as these, but now I know not why we should put out the fire at his\ncommand! He is war chief no longer, for Opechancanough will have no\ntame panther to lead the tribes. Opechancanough is our head, and\nOpechancanough kindleth a fire indeed! We will give to this one what\nfuel we choose, and to-night Nantauquas may look for the bones of the\nwhite men!\"\n\nHe ended, and a great clamor arose. The Paspaheghs would have cast\nthemselves upon us again but for a sudden action of the young chief,\nwho had stood motionless, with raised head and unmoved face, during the\nwerowance's bitter speech. Now he flung up his hand, and in it was a\nbracelet of gold carved and twisted like a coiled snake and set with a\ngreen stone. I had never seen the toy before, but evidently others\nhad done so. The excited voices fell, and the Indians, Pamunkeys and\nPaspaheghs alike, stood as though turned to stone.\n\nNantauquas smiled coldly. \"This day hath Opechancanough made me war\nchief again. We have smoked the peace pipe together--my father's brother\nand I--in the starlight, sitting before his lodge, with the wide marshes\nand the river dark at our feet. Singing birds in the forest have been\nmany; evil tales have they told; Opechancanough has stopped his ears\nagainst their false singing. My friends are his friends, my brother is\nhis brother, my word is his word: witness the armlet that hath no like;\nthat Opechancanough brought with him when he came from no man knows\nwhere to the land of the Powhatans, many Huskanawings ago; that no\nwhite men but these have ever seen. Opechancanough is at hand; he comes\nthrough the forest with his two hundred warriors that are as tall as\nSusquehannocks, and as brave as the children of Wahunsonacock. He comes\nto the temples to pray to Kiwassa for a great hunting. Will you, when\nyou lie at his feet, that he ask you, 'Where is the friend of my friend,\nof my war chief, of the Panther who is one with me again?'\"\n\nThere came a long, deep breath from the Indians, then a silence, in\nwhich they fell back, slowly and sullenly; whipped hounds, but with the\nwill to break that leash of fear.\n\n\"Hark!\" said Nantauquas, smiling. \"I hear Opechancanough and his\nwarriors coming over the leaves.\"\n\nThe noise of many footsteps was indeed audible, coming toward the\nhollow from the woods beyond. With a burst of cries, the priests and\nthe conjurer whirled away to bear the welcome of Okee to the royal\nworshiper, and at their heels went the chief men of the Pamunkeys.\nThe werowance of the Paspaheghs was one that sailed with the wind; he\nlistened to the deepening sound, and glanced at the son of Powhatan\nwhere he stood, calm and confident, then smoothed his own countenance\nand made a most pacific speech, in which all the blame of the late\nproceedings was laid upon the singing birds. When he had done speaking,\nthe young men tore the stakes from the earth and threw them into a\nthicket, while the women plucked apart the newly kindled fire and flung\nthe brands into a little near-by stream, where they went out in a cloud\nof hissing steam.\n\nI turned to the Indian who had wrought this miracle. \"Art sure it is\nnot a dream, Nantauquas?\" I said. \"I think that Opechancanough would not\nlift a finger to save me from all the deaths the tribes could invent.\"\n\n\"Opechancanough is very wise,\" he answered quietly. \"He says that now\nthe English will believe in his love indeed when they see that he holds\ndear even one who might be called his enemy, who hath spoken against\nhim at the Englishmen's council fire. He says that for five suns Captain\nPercy shall feast with Opechancanough, and that then he shall be sent\nback free to Jamestown. He thinks that then Captain Percy will not speak\nagainst him any more, calling his love to the white men only words with\nno good deeds behind.\"\n\nHe spoke simply, out of the nobility of his nature, believing his own\nspeech. I that was older, and had more knowledge of men and the masks\nthat they wear, was but half deceived. My belief in the hatred of the\ndark Emperor was not shaken, and I looked yet to find the drop of poison\nwithin this honey flower. How poisoned was that bloom God knows I could\nnot guess!\n\n\"When you were missed, three suns ago,\" Nantauquas went on, \"I and my\nbrother tracked you to the hut beside the forest, where we found only\nthe dead panther. There we struck the trail of the Paspaheghs; but\npresently we came to running water, and the trail was gone.\"\n\n\"We walked up the bed of the stream for half the night,\" I said.\n\nThe Indian nodded. \"I know. My brother went back to Jamestown for men\nand boats and guns to go to the Paspahegh village and up the Powhatan.\nHe was wise with the wisdom of the white men, but I, who needed no gun,\nand who would not fight against my own people, I stepped into the stream\nand walked up it until past the full sun power. Then I found a broken\ntwig and the print of a moccasin, half hidden by a bush, overlooked when\nthe other prints were smoothed away. I left the stream and followed the\ntrail until it was broken again. I looked for it no more then, for I\nknew that the Paspaheghs had turned their faces toward Uttamussac, and\nthat they would make a fire where many others had been made, in the\nhollow below the three temples. Instead I went with speed to seek\nOpechancanough. Yesterday, when the sun was low, I found him, sitting in\nhis lodge above the marshes and the colored river. We smoked the peace\npipe together, and I am his war chief again. I asked for the green\nstone, that I might show it to the Paspaheghs for a sign. He gave it,\nbut he willed to come to Uttamussac with me.\"\n\n\"I owe you my life,\" I said, with my hand upon his. \"I and Diccon\"--What\nI would have said he put aside with a fine gesture. \"Captain Percy is\nmy friend. My brother loves him, and he was kind to Matoax when she\nwas brought prisoner to Jamestown. I am glad that I could pull off this\nwolf.\"\n\n\"Tell me one thing,\" I asked. \"Before you left Jamestown, had you heard\naught of my wife or of my enemy?\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"At sunrise, the commander came to rouse my brother,\ncrying out that you had broken gaol and were nowhere to be found, and\nthat the man you hate was lying within the guest house, sorely torn by\nsome beast of the forest. My brother and I followed your trail at once;\nthe town was scarce awake when we left it behind us,--and I did not\nreturn.\"\n\nBy this we three were alone in the hollow, for all the savages, men and\nwomen, had gone forth to meet the Indian whose word was law from the\nfalls of the far west to the Chesapeake. The sun now rode above the low\nhills, pouring its gold into the hollow and brightening all the world\nbesides. The little stream flashed diamonds, and the carven devils upon\nthe black houses above us were frightful no longer. There was not a\nmenace anywhere from the cloudless skies to the sweet and plaintive\nchant to Kiwassa, sung by women and floating to us from the woods beyond\nthe hollow. The singing grew nearer, and the rustling of the leaves\nbeneath many feet more loud and deep; then all noise ceased, and\nOpechancanough entered the hollow alone. An eagle feather was thrust\nthrough his scalp lock; over his naked breast, that was neither painted\nnor pricked into strange figures, hung a triple row of pearls; his\nmantle was woven of bluebird feathers, as soft and sleek as satin. The\nface of this barbarian was dark, cold, and impassive as death. Behind\nthat changeless mask, as in a safe retreat, the supersubtle devil that\nwas the man might plot destruction and plan the laying of dreadful\nmines. He had dignity and courage,--no man denied him that. I suppose he\nthought that he and his had wrongs: God knows! perhaps they had. But if\never we were hard or unjust in our dealings with the savages,--I say not\nthat this was the case,--at least we were not treacherous and dealt not\nin Judas kisses.\n\nI stepped forward, and met him on the spot where the fire had been. For\na minute neither spoke. It was true that I had striven against him many\na time, and I knew that he knew it. It was also true that without his\naid Nantauquas could not have rescued us from that dire peril. And it\nwas again the truth that an Indian neither forgives nor forgets. He was\nmy saviour, and I knew that mercy had been shown for some dark reason\nwhich I could not divine. Yet I owed him thanks, and gave them as\nshortly and simply as I could.\n\nHe heard me out with neither liking nor disliking nor any other emotion\nwritten upon his face; but when I had finished, as though he suddenly\nbethought himself, he smiled and held out his hand, white-man fashion.\nNow, when a man's lips widen I look into his eyes. The eyes of\nOpechancanough were as fathomless as a pool at midnight, and as devoid\nof mirth or friendliness as the staring orbs of the carven imps upon the\ntemple corners.\n\n\"Singing birds have lied to Captain Percy,\" he said, and his voice was\nlike his eyes. \"Opechancanough thinks that Captain Percy will never\nlisten to them again. The chief of the Powhatans is a lover of the white\nmen, of the English, and of other white men,--if there are others. He\nwould call the Englishmen his brothers, and be taught of them how to\nrule, and who to pray to\"--\n\n\"Let Opechancanough go with me to-day to Jamestown,\" I said. \"He hath\nthe wisdom of the woods; let him come and gain that of the town.\"\n\nThe Emperor smiled again. \"I will come to Jamestown soon, but not to-day\nnor to-morrow nor the next day. And Captain Percy must smoke the peace\npipe in my lodge above the Pamunkey, and watch my young men and maidens\ndance, and eat with me five days. Then he may go back to Jamestown\nwith presents for the great white father there, and with a message that\nOpechancanough is coming soon to learn of the white men.\"\n\nI could have gnashed my teeth at that delay when she must think me dead,\nbut it would have been the madness of folly to show the impatience which\nI felt. I too could smile with my lips when occasion drove, and drink a\nbitter draught as though my soul delighted in it. Blithe enough to\nall seeming, and with as few inward misgivings as the case called for,\nDiccon and I went with the subtle Emperor and the young chief he had\nbound to himself once more, and with their fierce train, back to that\nvillage which we had never thought to see again. A day and a night we\nstayed there; then Opechancanough sent away the Paspaheghs,--where we\nknew not,--and taking us with him went to his own village above the\ngreat marshes of the Pamunkey.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII IN WHICH WE ARE THE GUESTS OF AN EMPEROR\n\n\nI HAD before this spent days among the Indians, on voyages of discovery,\nas conqueror, as negotiator for food, exchanging blue beads for corn and\nturkeys. Other Englishmen had been with me. Knowing those with whom we\ndealt for sly and fierce heathen, friends to-day, to-morrow deadly foes,\nwe kept our muskets ready and our eyes and ears open, and, what with the\ndanger and the novelty and the bold wild life, managed to extract some\nmerriment as well as profit from these visits. It was different now.\n\nDay after day I ate my heart out in that cursed village. The feasting\nand the hunting and the triumph, the wild songs and wilder dances, the\nfantastic mummeries, the sudden rages, the sudden laughter, the great\nfires with their rings of painted warriors, the sleepless sentinels, the\nwide marshes that could not be crossed by night, the leaves that rustled\nso loudly beneath the lightest footfall, the monotonous days, the\nendless nights when I thought of her grief, of her peril, maybe,--it was\nan evil dream, and for my own pleasure I could not wake too soon.\n\nShould we ever wake? Should we not sink from that dream without pause\ninto a deeper sleep whence there would be no waking? It was a question\nthat I asked myself each morning, half looking to find another hollow\nbetween the hills before the night should fall. The night fell, and\nthere was no change in the dream.\n\nI will allow that the dark Emperor to whom we were so much beholden gave\nus courteous keeping. The best of the hunt was ours, the noblest fish,\nthe most delicate roots. The skins beneath which we slept were fine and\nsoft; the women waited upon us, and the old men and warriors held with\nus much stately converse, sitting beneath the budding trees with the\nblue tobacco smoke curling above our heads. We were alive and sound\nof limb, well treated and with the promise of release; we might have\nwaited, seeing that wait we must, in some measure of content. We did not\nso. There was a horror in the air. From the marshes that were growing\ngreen, from the sluggish river, from the rotting leaves and cold black\nearth and naked forest, it rose like an exhalation. We knew not what it\nwas, but we breathed it in, and it went to the marrow of our bones.\n\nOpechancanough we rarely saw, though we were bestowed so near to him\nthat his sentinels served for ours. Like some god, he kept within his\nlodge with the winding passage, and the hanging mats between him and the\nworld without. At other times, issuing from that retirement, he would\nstride away into the forest. Picked men went with him, and they were\ngone for hours; but when they returned they bore no trophies, brute or\nhuman. What they did we could not guess. We might have had much comfort\nin Nantauquas, but the morning after our arrival in this village the\nEmperor sent him upon an embassy to the Rappahannocks, and when for\nthe fourth time the forest stood black against the sunset he had not\nreturned. If escape had been possible, we would not have awaited the\ndoubtful fulfillment of that promise made to us below the Uttamussac\ntemples. But the vigilance of the Indians never slept; they watched us\nlike hawks, night and day. And the dry leaves underfoot would not hold\ntheir peace, and there were the marshes to cross and the river.\n\nThus four days dragged themselves by, and in the early morning of the\nfifth, when we came from our wigwam, it was to find Nantauquas sitting\nby the fire, magnificent in the paint and trappings of the ambassador,\nmotionless as a piece of bronze, and apparently quite unmindful of the\nadmiring glances of the women who knelt about the fire preparing our\nbreakfast. When he saw us he rose and came to meet us, and I embraced\nhim, I was so glad to see him. \"The Rappahannocks feasted me long,\" he\nsaid. \"I was afraid that Captain Percy would be gone to Jamestown before\nI was back upon the Pamunkey.\"\n\n\"Shall I ever see Jamestown again, Nantauquas?\" I demanded. \"I have my\ndoubts.\"\n\nHe looked me full in the eyes, and there was no doubting the candor of\nhis own. \"You go with the next sunrise,\" he answered. \"Opechancanough\nhas given me his word.\"\n\n\"I am glad to hear it,\" I said. \"Why have we been kept at all? Why did\nhe not free us five days agone?\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"I do not know. Opechancanough has many thoughts\nwhich he shares with no man. But now he will send you with presents for\nthe Governor, and with messages of his love to the white men. There will\nbe a great feast to-day, and to-night the young men and maidens will\ndance before you. Then in the morning you will go.\"\n\n\"Will you not come with us?\" I asked. \"You are ever welcome amongst us,\nNantauquas, both for your sister's sake and for your own. Rolfe will\nrejoice to have you with him again; he ever grudgeth you to the forest.\"\n\nHe shook his head again. \"Nantauquas, the son of Powhatan, hath had much\ntalk with himself lately,\" he said simply. \"The white men's ways have\nseemed very good to him, and the God of the white men he knows to be\ngreater than Okee, and to be good and tender; not like Okee, who sucks\nthe blood of the children. He remembers Matoax, too, and how she loved\nand cared for the white men and would weep when danger threatened them.\nAnd Rolfe is his brother and his teacher. But Opechancanough is his\nking, and the red men are his people, and the forest is his home. If,\nbecause he loved Rolfe, and because the ways of the white men seemed to\nhim better than his own ways, he forgot these things, he did wrong,\nand the One over All frowns upon him. Now he has come back to his home\nagain, to the forest and the hunting and the warpath, to his king and\nhis people. He will be again the panther crouching upon the bough\"--\n\n\"Above the white men?\"\n\nHe gazed at me in silence, a shadow upon his face. \"Above the Monacans,\"\nhe answered slowly. \"Why did Captain Percy say 'above the white men'?\nOpechancanough and the English have buried the hatchet forever, and the\nsmoke of the peace pipe will never fade from the air. Nantauquas meant\n'above the Monacans or the Long House dogs.'\"\n\nI put my hand upon his shoulder. \"I know you did, brother of Rolfe by\nnature if not by blood! Forget what I said; it was without thought\nor meaning. If we go indeed to-morrow, I shall be loath to leave you\nbehind; and yet, were I in your place, I should do as you are doing.\"\n\nThe shadow left his face and he drew himself up. \"Is it what you call\nfaith and loyalty and like a knight?\" he demanded, with a touch of\neagerness breaking through the slowness and gravity with which an Indian\nspeaks.\n\n\"Yea,\" I made reply. \"I think you good knight and true, Nantauquas, and\nmy friend, moreover, who saved my life.\"\n\nHis smile was like his sister's, quick and very bright, and leaving\nbehind it a most entire gravity. Together we sat down by the fire and\nate of the sylvan breakfast, with shy brown maidens to serve us and with\nthe sunshine streaming down upon us through the trees that were growing\nfaintly green. It was a thing to smile at to see how the Indian girls\nmanoeuvred to give the choicest meat, the most delicate maize cakes,\nto the young war chief, and to see how quietly he turned aside their\nbenevolence. The meal over, he went to divest himself of his red and\nwhite paint, of the stuffed hawk and strings of copper that formed his\nheaddress, of his gorgeous belt and quiver and his mantle of raccoon\nskins, while Diccon and I sat still before our wigwam, smoking, and\nreckoning the distance to Jamestown and the shortest time in which we\ncould cover it.\n\nWhen we had sat there for an hour the old men and the warriors came to\nvisit us, and the smoking must commence all over again. The women laid\nmats in a great half circle, and each savage took his seat with perfect\nbreeding; that is, in absolute silence and with a face like a stone.\nThe peace paint was upon them all,--red, or red and white; they sat and\nlooked at the ground until I had made the speech of welcome. Soon the\nair was dense with the fragrant smoke; in the thick blue haze the sweep\nof painted figures had the seeming of some fantastic dream. An old\nman arose and made a long and touching speech with much reference to\ncalumets and buried hatchets. When he had finished a chief talked of\nOpechancanough's love for the English, \"high as the stars, deep as\nPopogusso, wide as from the sunrise to the sunset,\" adding that the\ndeath of Nemattanow last year and the troubles over the hunting grounds\nhad kindled in the breasts of the Indians no desire for revenge. With\nwhich highly probable statement he made an end, and all sat in silence\nlooking at me and waiting for my contribution of honeyed words. These\nPamunkeys, living at a distance from the settlements, had but little\nEnglish to their credit, and the learning of the Paspaheghs was not much\ngreater. I sat and repeated to them the better part of the seventh canto\nof the second book of Master Spenser's \"Faery Queen.\" Then I told them\nthe story of the Moor of Venice, and ended by relating Smith's tale of\nthe three Turks' heads. It all answered the purpose to admiration. When\nat length they went away to change their paint for the coming feast\nDiccon and I laughed at that foolery as though there were none beside us\nwho could juggle with words. We were as light-hearted as children--God\nforgive us!\n\nThe day wore on, with relay after relay of food which we must taste at\nleast, with endless smoking of pipes and speeches that must be listened\nto and answered. When evening came and our entertainers drew off to\nprepare for the dance, they left us as wearied as by a long day's march.\n\nThe wind had been high during the day, but with the sunset it sank to\na desolate murmur. The sky wore the strange crimson of the past year\nat Weyanoke. Against that sea of color the pines were drawn in ink, and\nbeneath it the winding, threadlike creeks that pierced the marshes had\nthe look of spilt blood moving slowly and heavily to join the river that\nwas black where the pines shadowed it, red where the light touched\nit. From the marsh arose the cry of some great bird that made its home\nthere; it had a lonely and a boding sound, like a trumpet blown above\nthe dead. The color died into an ashen gray and the air grew cold,\nwith a heaviness beside that dragged at the very soul. Diccon shivered\nviolently, turned restlessly upon the log that served him as settle, and\nbegan to mutter to himself.\n\n\"Art cold?\" I asked.\n\nHe shook his head. \"Something walked over my grave,\" he said. \"I would\ngive all the pohickory that was ever brewed by heathen for a toss of\naqua vitae!\"\n\nIn the centre of the village rose a great heap of logs and dry branches,\nbuilt during the day by the women and children. When the twilight fell\nand the owls began to hoot this pile was fired, and lit the place from\nend to end. The scattered wigwams, the scaffolding where the fish\nwere dried, the tall pines and wide-branching mulberries, the trodden\ngrass,--all flashed into sight as the flame roared up to the top-most\nwithered bough. The village glowed like a lamp set in the dead blackness\nof marsh and forest. Opechancanough came from the forest with a score of\nwarriors behind him, and stopped beside me. I rose to greet him, as was\ndecent; for he was an Emperor, albeit a savage and a pagan. \"Tell the\nEnglish that Opechancanough grows old,\" he said. \"The years that once\nwere as light upon him as the dew upon the maize are now hailstones\nto beat him back to the earth whence he came. His arm is not swift to\nstrike and strong as it once was. He is old; the warpath and the scalp\ndance please him no longer. He would die at peace with all men. Tell\nthe English this; tell them also that Opechancanough knows that they are\ngood and just, that they do not treat men whose color is not their own\nlike babes, fooling them with toys, thrusting them out of their path\nwhen they grow troublesome. The land is wide and the hunting grounds\nare many. Let the red men who were here as many moons ago as there are\nleaves in summer and the white men who came yesterday dwell side by side\nin peace, sharing the maize fields and the weirs and the hunting grounds\ntogether.\" He waited not for my answer, but passed on, and there was no\nsign of age in his stately figure and his slow, firm step. I watched him\nwith a frown until the darkness of his lodge had swallowed up him and\nhis warriors, and mistrusted him for a cold and subtle devil.\n\nSuddenly, as we sat staring at the fire we were beset by a band of\nmaidens, coming out of the woods, painted, with antlers upon their heads\nand pine branches in their hands. They danced about us, now advancing\nuntil the green needles met above our heads, now retreating until there\nwas a space of turf between us. Their slender limbs gleamed in the\nfirelight; they moved with grace, keeping time to a plaintive song, now\nraised by the whole choir, now fallen to a single voice. Pocahontas\nhad danced thus before the English many a time. I thought of the little\nmaid, of her great wondering eyes and her piteous, untimely death, of\nhow loving she was to Rolfe and how happy they had been in their brief\nwedded life. It had bloomed like a rose, as fair and as early fallen,\nwith only a memory of past sweetness. Death was a coward, passing by\nmen whose trade it was to out-brave him, and striking at the young and\nlovely and innocent....\n\nWe were tired with all the mummery of the day; moreover, every fibre of\nour souls had been strained to meet the hours that had passed since we\nleft the gaol at Jamestown. The elation we had felt earlier in the day\nwas all gone. Now, the plaintive song, the swaying figures, the red\nlight beating against the trees, the blackness of the enshrouding\nforest, the low, melancholy wind,--all things seemed strange, and yet\ndeadly old, as though we had seen and heard them since the beginning of\nthe world. All at once a fear fell upon me, causeless and unreasonable,\nbut weighing upon my heart like a stone. She was in a palisaded town,\nunder the Governor's protection, with my friends about her and my enemy\nlying sick, unable to harm her. It was I, not she, that was in danger.\nI laughed at myself, but my heart was heavy, and I was in a fever to be\ngone.\n\nThe Indian girls danced more and more swiftly, and their song changed,\nbecoming gay and shrill and sweet. Higher and higher rang the notes,\nfaster and faster moved the dark limbs; then, quite suddenly, song and\nmotion ceased together. They who had danced with the abandonment of wild\npriestesses to some wild god were again but shy brown Indian maids who\nwent and set them meekly down upon the grass beneath the trees. From the\ndarkness now came a burst of savage cries only less appalling than the\nwar whoop itself. In a moment the men of the village had rushed from the\nshadow of the trees into the broad, firelit space before us. Now they\ncircled around us, now around the fire; now each man danced and stamped\nand muttered to himself. For the most part they were painted red, but\nsome were white from head to heel,--statues come to life,--while others\nhad first oiled their bodies, then plastered them over with small\nbright-colored feathers. The tall headdresses made giants of them all;\nas they leaped and danced in the glare of the fire they had a fiendish\nlook. They sang, too, but the air was rude, and broken by dreadful\ncries. Out of a hut behind us burst two or three priests, the conjurer,\nand a score or more of old men. They had Indian drums upon which\nthey beat furiously, and long pipes made of reeds which gave forth no\nuncertain sound. Fixed upon a pole and borne high above them was the\nimage of their Okee, a hideous thing of stuffed skins and rattling\nchains of copper. When they had joined themselves to the throng in the\nfirelight the clamor became deafening. Some one piled on more logs,\nand the place grew light as day. Opechancanough was not there, nor\nNantauquas.\n\nDiccon and I watched that uncouth spectacle, that Virginian masque, as\nwe had watched many another one, with disgust and weariness. It would\nlast, we knew, for the better part of the night. It was in our honor,\nand for a while we must stay and testify our pleasure; but after a time,\nwhen they had sung and danced themselves into oblivion of our presence,\nwe might retire, and leave the very old men, the women, and the children\nsole spectators. We waited for that relief with impatience, though we\nshowed it not to those who pressed about us.\n\nTime passed, and the noise deepened and the dancing became more frantic.\nThe dancers struck at one another as they leaped and whirled, the sweat\nrolled from their bodies, and from their lips came hoarse, animal-like\ncries. The fire, ever freshly fed, roared and crackled, mocking the\nsilent stars. The pines were bronze-red, the woods beyond a dead black.\nAll noises of marsh and forest were lost in the scream of the pipes, the\nwild yelling, and the beating of the drums.\n\nFrom the ranks of the women beneath the reddened pines rose shrill\nlaughter and applause as they sat or knelt, bent forward, watching the\ndancers. One girl alone watched not them, but us. She stood somewhat\nback of her companions, one slim brown hand touching the trunk of a\ntree, one brown foot advanced, her attitude that of one who waits but\nfor a signal to be gone. Now and then she glanced impatiently at the\nwheeling figures, or at the old men and the few warriors who took no\npart in the masque, but her eyes always came back to us. She had been\namong the maidens who danced before us earlier in the night; when they\nrested beneath the trees she had gone away, and the night was much older\nwhen I marked her again, coming out of the firelit distance back to the\nfire and her dusky mates. It was soon after this that I became aware\nthat she must have some reason for her anxious scrutiny, some message to\ndeliver or warning to give. Once when I made a slight motion as if to go\nto her, she shook her head and laid her finger upon her lips.\n\nA dancer fell from sheer exhaustion, another and another, and warriors\nfrom the dozen or more seated at our right began to take the places of\nthe fallen. The priests shook their rattles, and made themselves dizzy\nwith bending and whirling about their Okee; the old men, too, though\nthey sat like statues, thought only of the dance, and of how they\nthemselves had excelled, long ago when they were young.\n\nI rose, and making my way to the werowance of the village where he\nsat with his eyes fixed upon a young Indian, his son, who bade fair to\noutlast all others in that wild contest, told him that I was wearied and\nwould go to my hut, I and my servant, to rest for the few hours that yet\nremained of the night. He listened dreamily, his eyes upon the dancing\nIndian, but made offer to escort me thither. I pointed out to him that\nmy quarters were not fifty yards away, in the broad firelight, in sight\nof them all, and that it were a pity to take him or any others from the\ncontemplation of that whirling Indian, so strong and so brave that he\nwould surely one day lead the war parties.\n\nAfter a moment he acquiesced, and Diccon and I, quietly and yet with\nsome ostentation, so as to avoid all appearance of stealing away, left\nthe press of savages and began to cross the firelit turf between them\nand our lodge. When we had gone fifty paces I glanced over my shoulder\nand saw that the Indian maid no longer stood where we had last seen\nher, beneath the pines. A little farther on we caught a glimpse of her\nwinding in and out among a row of trees to our left. The trees ran past\nour lodge. When we had reached its entrance we paused and looked back to\nthe throng we had left. Every back seemed turned to us, every eye intent\nupon the leaping figures around the great fire. Swiftly and quietly we\nwalked across the bit of even ground to the friendly trees, and found\nourselves in a thin strip of shadow between the light of the great fire\nwe had left and that of a lesser one burning redly before the Emperor's\nlodge. Beneath the trees, waiting for us, was the Indian maid, with her\nlight form, and large, shy eyes, and finger upon her lips. She would not\nspeak or tarry, but flitted before us as dusk and noiseless as a moth,\nand we followed her into the darkness beyond the firelight, well-nigh\nto the line of sentinels. A wigwam, larger than common and shadowed by\ntrees, rose in our path; the girl, gliding in front of us, held aside\nthe mats that curtained the entrance. We hesitated a moment, then\nstooped and entered the place.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII IN WHICH MY FRIEND BECOMES MY FOE\n\n\nIN the centre of the wigwam the customary fire burned clear and bright,\nshowing the white mats, the dressed skins, the implements of war\nhanging upon the bark walls,--all the usual furniture of an Indian\ndwelling,--and showing also Nantauquas standing against the stripped\ntrunk of a pine that pierced the wigwam from floor to roof. The fire was\nbetween us. He stood so rigid, at his full height, with folded arms and\nhead held high, and his features were so blank and still, so forced and\nfrozen, as it were, into composure, that, with the red light beating\nupon him and the thin smoke curling above his head, he had the look of a\nwarrior tied to the stake.\n\n\"Nantauquas!\" I exclaimed, and striding past the fire would have touched\nhim but that with a slight and authoritative motion of the hand he kept\nme back. Otherwise there was no change in his position or in the dead\ncalm of his face.\n\nThe Indian maid had dropped the mat at the entrance, and if she waited,\nwaited without in the darkness. Diccon, now staring at the young chief,\nnow eyeing the weapons upon the wall with all a lover's passion, kept\nnear the doorway. Through the thickness of the bark and woven twigs the\nwild cries and singing came to us somewhat faintly; beneath that distant\nnoise could be heard the wind in the trees and the soft fall of the\nburning pine.\n\n\"Well!\" I asked at last. \"What is the matter, my friend?\"\n\nFor a full minute he made no answer, and when he did speak his voice\nmatched his face.\n\n\"My friend,\" he said, \"I am going to show myself a friend indeed to the\nEnglish, to the strangers who were not content with their own hunting\ngrounds beyond the great salt water. When I have done this, I do not\nknow that Captain Percy will call me 'friend' again.\"\n\n\"You were wont to speak plainly, Nantauquas,\" I answered him. \"I am not\nfond of riddles.\"\n\nAgain he waited, as though he found speech difficult. I stared at him in\namazement, he was so changed in so short a time.\n\nHe spoke at last: \"When the dance is over, and the fires are low, and\nthe sunrise is at hand, then will Opechancanough come to you to bid you\nfarewell. He will give you the pearls that he wears about his neck for a\npresent to the Governor, and a bracelet for yourself. Also he will give\nyou three men for a guard through the forest. He has messages of love to\nsend the white men, and he would send them by you who were his enemy and\nhis captive. So all the white men shall believe in his love.\"\n\n\"Well,\" I said dryly as he paused. \"I will take his messages. What\nnext?\"\n\n\"Those are the words of Opechancanough. Now listen to the words of\nNantauquas, the son of Wahunsonacock, a war chief of the Powhatans.\nThere are two sharp knives there, hanging beneath the bow and the quiver\nand the shield. Take them and hide them.\"\n\nThe words were scarcely out of his mouth before Diccon had the two keen\nEnglish blades. I took the one he offered me, and hid it in my doublet.\n\n\"So we go armed, Nantauquas,\" I said. \"Love and peace and goodwill\nconsort not with such toys.\"\n\n\"You may want them,\" he went on, with no change in his low, measured\ntones. \"If you see aught in the forest that you should not see, if they\nthink you know more than you are meant to know, then those three, who\nhave knives and tomahawks, are to kill you, whom they believe unarmed.\"\n\n\"See aught that we should not see, know more than we are meant to know?\"\nI said. \"To the point, friend.\"\n\n\"They will go slowly, too, through the forest to Jamestown, stopping to\neat and to sleep. For them there is no need to run like the stag with\nthe hunter behind him.\"\n\n\"Then we should make for Jamestown as for life,\" I said, \"not sleeping\nor eating or making pause?\"\n\n\"Yea,\" he replied, \"if you would not die, you and all your people.\"\n\nIn the silence of the hut the fire crackled, and the branches of the\ntrees outside, bent by the wind, made a grating sound against the bark\nroof.\n\n\"How die?\" I asked at last. \"Speak out!\"\n\n\"Die by the arrow and the tomahawk,\" he answered,--\"yea, and by the\nguns you have given the red men. To-morrow's sun, and the next, and the\nnext,--three suns,--and the tribes will fall upon the English. At the\nsame hour, when the men are in the fields and the women and children\nare in the houses, they will strike,--Kecoughtans, Paspaheghs,\nChickahominies, Pamunkeys, Arrowhatocks, Chesapeakes, Nansemonds,\nAccomacs,--as one man will they strike; and from where the Powhatan\nfalls over the rocks to the salt water beyond Accomac, there will not be\none white man left alive.\"\n\nHe ceased to speak, and for a minute the fire made the only sound in\nthe hut. Then, \"All die?\" I asked dully. \"There are three thousand\nEnglishmen in Virginia.\"\n\n\"They are scattered and unwarned. The fighting men of the villages of\nthe Powhatan and the Pamunkey and the great bay are many, and they have\nsharpened their hatchets and filled their quivers with arrows.\"\n\n\"Scattered,\" I said, \"strewn broadcast up and down the river,--here a\nlonely house, there a cluster of two or three; they at Jamestown and\nHenricus off guard,--the men in the fields or at the wharves, the women\nand the children busy within doors, all unwarned--O my God!\"\n\nDiccon strode over from the doorway to the fire. \"We'd best be going, I\nreckon, sir,\" he cried. \"Or you wait until morning; then there'll be two\nchances. Now that I've a knife, I'm thinking I can give account of one\nof them damned sentries, at least. Once clear of them\"--\n\nI shook my head, and the Indian too made a gesture of dissent. \"You\nwould only be the first to die.\"\n\nI leaned against the side of the hut, for my heart beat like a\nfrightened woman's. \"Three days!\" I exclaimed. \"If we go with all our\nspeed we shall be in time. When did you learn this thing?\"\n\n\"While you watched the dance,\" he answered, \"Opechancanough and I sat\nwithin his lodge in the darkness. His heart was moved, and he talked to\nme of his own youth in a strange country, south of the sunset, where he\nand his people dwelt in stone houses and worshiped a great and fierce\ngod, giving him blood to drink and flesh to eat. To that country,\ntoo, white men had come in ships. Then he spoke to me of Powhatan, my\nfather,--of how wise he was and how great a chief before the English\ncame, and how the English made him kneel in sign that he held his lands\nfrom their King, and how he hated them; and then he told me that the\ntribes had called me 'woman,' 'lover no longer of the warpath and the\nscalp dance,' but that he, who had no son, loved me as his son, knowing\nmy heart to be Indian still; and then I heard what I have told you.\"\n\n\"How long had this been planned?\"\n\n\"For many moons. I have been a child, fooled and turned aside from the\ntrail; not wise enough to see it beneath the flowers, through the smoke\nof the peace pipes.\"\n\n\"Why does Opechancanough send us back to the settlements?\" I demanded.\n\"Their faith in him needs no strengthening.\"\n\n\"It is his fancy. Every hunter and trader and learner of our tongues,\nliving in the villages or straying in the woods, has been sent back\nto Jamestown or to his hundred with presents and with words that are\nsweeter than honey. He has told the three who go with you the hour in\nwhich you are to reach Jamestown; he would have you as singing birds,\ntelling lying tales to the Governor, with scarce the smoking of a pipe\nbetween those words of peace and the war whoop. But if those who go with\nyou see reason to misdoubt you, they will kill you in the forest.\"\n\nHis voice fell, and he stood in silence, straight as an arrow, against\nthe post, the firelight playing over his dark limbs and sternly quiet\nface. Outside, the night wind, rising, began to howl through the naked\nbranches, and a louder burst of yells came to us from the roisterers in\nthe distance. The mat before the doorway shook, and a slim brown hand,\nslipped between the wood and the woven grass, beckoned to us.\n\n\"Why did you come?\" demanded the Indian. \"Long ago, when there were\nnone but dark men from the Chesapeake to the hunting grounds beneath the\nsunset, we were happy. Why did you leave your own land, in the strange\nblack ships with sails like the piled-up clouds of summer? Was it not a\ngood land? Were not your forests broad and green, your fields fruitful,\nyour rivers deep and filled with fish? And the towns I have heard\nof--were they not fair? You are brave men: had you no enemies there,\nand no warpaths? It was your home: a man should love the good earth over\nwhich he hunts, upon which stands his village. This is the red man's\nland. He wishes his hunting grounds, his maize fields, and his rivers\nfor himself, his women and children. He has no ships in which to go to\nanother country. When you first came we thought you were gods; but you\nhave not done like the great white God who, you say, loves you so. You\nare wiser and stronger than we, but your strength and wisdom help us\nnot: they press us down from men to children; they are weights upon the\nhead and shoulders of a babe to keep him under stature. Ill gifts have\nyou brought us, evil have you wrought us\"--\n\n\"Not to you, Nantauquas!\" I cried, stung into speech.\n\nHe turned his eyes upon me. \"Nantauquas is the war chief of his tribe.\nOpechancanough is his king, and he lies upon his bed in his lodge\nand says within himself: 'My war chief, the Panther, the son of\nWahunsonacock, who was chief of all the Powhatans, sits now within his\nwigwam, sharpening flints for his arrows, making his tomahawk bright and\nkeen, thinking of a day three suns hence, when the tribes will shake off\nforever the hand upon their shoulder,--the hand so heavy and white that\nstrives always to bend them to the earth and keep them there.' Tell me,\nyou Englishman who have led in war, another name for Nantauquas, and ask\nno more what evil you have done him.\"\n\n\"I will not call you 'traitor,' Nantauquas,\" I said, after a pause.\n\"There is a difference. You are not the first child of Powhatan who has\nloved and shielded the white men.\"\n\n\"She was a woman, a child,\" he answered. \"Out of pity she saved your\nlives, not knowing that it was to the hurt of her people. Then you were\nfew and weak, and could not take your revenge. Now, if you die not, you\nwill drink deep of vengeance,--so deep that your lips may never leave\nthe cup. More ships will come, and more; you will grow ever stronger.\nThere may come a moon when the deep forests and the shining rivers know\nus, to whom Kiwassa gave them, no more.\" He paused, with unmoved face,\nand eyes that seemed to pierce the wall and look out into unfathomable\ndistances. \"Go!\" he said at last. \"If you die not in the woods, if you\nsee again the man whom I called my brother and teacher, tell him. ..\ntell him nothing! Go!\"\n\n\"Come with us,\" urged Diccon gruffly. \"We English will make a place for\nyou among us\"--and got no further, for I turned upon him with a stern\ncommand for silence.\n\n\"I ask of you no such thing, Nantauquas,\" I said. \"Come against us,\nif you will. Nobly warned, fair upon our guard, we will meet you as\nknightly foe should be met.\"\n\nHe stood for a minute, the quick change that had come into his face\nat Diccon's blundering words gone, and his features sternly impassive\nagain; then, very slowly, he raised his arm from his side and held out\nhis hand. His eyes met mine in sombre inquiry, half eager, half proudly\ndoubtful.\n\nI went to him at once, and took his hand in mine. No word was spoken.\nPresently he withdrew his hand from my clasp, and, putting his finger\nto his lips, whistled low to the Indian girl. She drew aside the hanging\nmats, and we passed out, Diccon and I, leaving him standing as we had\nfound him, upright against the post, in the red firelight.\n\nShould we ever go through the woods, pass through that gathering storm,\nreach Jamestown, warn them there of the death that was rushing upon\nthem? Should we ever leave that hated village? Would the morning ever\ncome? When we reached our hut, unseen, and sat down just within the\ndoorway to watch for the dawn, it seemed as though the stars would never\npale. Again and again the leaping Indians between us and the fire fed\nthe tall flame; if one figure fell in the wild dancing, another took its\nplace; the yelling never ceased, nor the beating of the drums.\n\nIt was an alarum that was sounding, and there were only two to hear;\nmiles away beneath the mute stars English men and women lay asleep, with\nthe hour thundering at their gates, and there was none to cry, \"Awake!\"\nWhen would the dawn come, when should we be gone? I could have cried out\nin that agony of waiting, with the leagues on leagues to be traveled,\nand the time so short! If we never reached those sleepers--I saw the\ndark warriors gathering, tribe on tribe, war party on war party, thick\ncrowding shadows of death, slipping though the silent forest... and\nthe clearings we had made and the houses we had built... the goodly\nEnglishmen, Kent and Thorpe and Yeardley, Maddison, Wynne, Hamor, the\nmen who had striven to win and hold this land so fatal and so fair, West\nand Rolfe and Jeremy Sparrow... the children about the doorsteps, the\nwomen... one woman...\n\nIt came to an end, as all things earthly will. The flames of the great\nbonfire sank lower and lower, and as they sank the gray light faltered\ninto being, grew, and strengthened. At last the dancers were still, the\nwomen scattered, the priests with their hideous Okee gone. The wailing\nof the pipes died away, the drums ceased to beat, and the village lay in\nthe keen wind and the pale light, inert and quiet with the stillness of\nexhaustion.\n\nThe pause and hush did not last. When the ruffled pools amid the marshes\nwere rosy beneath the sunrise, the women brought us food, and the\nwarriors and old men gathered about us. They sat upon mats or billets of\nwood, and I offered them bread and meat, and told them they must come to\nJamestown to taste of the white man's cookery.\n\nScarcely was the meal over when Opechancanough issued from his lodge,\nwith his picked men behind him, and, coming slowly up to us, took his\nseat upon the white mat that was spread for him. For a few minutes he\nsat in a silence that neither we nor his people cared to break. Only\nthe wind sang in the brown branches, and from some forest brake came a\nstag's hoarse cry. As he sat in the sunshine he glistened all over, like\nan Ethiop besprent with silver; for his dark limbs and mighty chest had\nbeen oiled, and then powdered with antimony. Through his scalp lock was\nstuck an eagle's feather; across his face, from temple to chin, was a\nbar of red paint; the eyes above were very bright and watchful, but we\nupon whom that scrutiny was bent were as little wont as he to let our\nfaces tell our minds.\n\nOne of his young men brought a great pipe, carved and painted, stem and\nbowl; an old man filled it with tobacco, and a warrior lit it and bore\nit to the Emperor. He put it to his lips and smoked in silence, while\nthe sun climbed higher and higher, and the golden minutes that were more\nprecious than heart's blood went by, at once too slow, too swift.\n\nAt last, his part in the solemn mockery played, he held out the pipe to\nme. \"The sky will fall, and the rivers run dry, and the birds cease to\nsing,\" he said, \"before the smoke of the calumet fades from the land.\"\n\nI took the symbol of peace, and smoked it as silently and soberly--ay,\nand as slowly--as he had done before me, then laid it leisurely aside\nand held out my hand. \"My eyes have been holden,\" I told him, \"but now\nI see plainly the deep graves of the hatchets and the drifting of the\npeace smoke through the forest. Let Opechancanough come to Jamestown to\nsmoke of the Englishman's uppowoc, and to receive rich presents,--a red\nrobe like his brother Powhatan's, and a cup from which he shall drink,\nhe and all his people.\"\n\nHe laid his dark fingers in mine for an instant, withdrew them, and,\nrising to his feet, motioned to three Indians who stood out from the\nthrong of warriors. \"These are Captain Percy's guides and friends,\"\nhe announced. \"The sun is high; it is time that he was gone. Here are\npresents for him and for my brother the Governor.\" As he spoke, he took\nfrom his neck the rope of pearls and from his arm a copper bracelet, and\nlaid both upon my palm.\n\nI thrust the pearls within my doublet, and slipped the bracelet upon my\nwrist. \"Thanks, Opechancanough,\" I said briefly. \"When we meet again I\nshall not greet you with empty thanks.\"\n\nBy this all the folk of the village had gathered around us; and now the\ndrums beat again, and the maidens raised a wild and plaintive song\nof farewell. At a sign from the werowance men and women formed a rude\nprocession, and followed us, who were to go upon a journey, to the edge\nof the village where the marsh began. Only the dark Emperor and the old\nmen stayed behind, sitting and standing in the sunshine, with the peace\npipe lying on the grass at their feet, and the wind moving the branches\noverhead. I looked back and saw them thus, and wondered idly how many\nminutes they would wait before putting on the black paint. Of Nantauquas\nwe had seen nothing. Either he had gone to the forest, or upon some\npretense he kept within his lodge.\n\nWe bade farewell to the noisy throng who had brought us upon our way,\nand went down to the river, where we found a canoe and rowers, crossed\nthe stream, and, bidding the rowers good-by, entered the forest. It\nwas Wednesday morning, and the sun was two hours high. Three suns,\nNantauquas had said: on Friday, then, the blow would fall. Three\ndays! Once at Jamestown, it would take three days to warn each lonely\nscattered settlement, to put the colony into any posture of defense.\nWhat of the leagues of danger-haunted forest to be traversed before even\na single soul of the three thousand could be warned?\n\nAs for the three Indians,--who had their orders to go slowly, who at any\nsuspicious haste or question or anxiety on our part were to kill us whom\nthey deemed unarmed,--when they left their village that morning, they\nleft it forever. There were times when Diccon and I had no need of\nspeech, but knew each other's mind without; so now, though no word had\nbeen spoken, we were agreed to set upon and slay our guides the first\noccasion that offered.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV IN WHICH THE RACE IS NOT TO THE SWIFT\n\n\nTHE three Indians of whom we must rid ourselves were approved warriors,\nfierce as wolves, cunning as foxes, keen-eyed as hawks. They had no\nreason to doubt us, to dream that we would turn upon them, but from\nhabit they watched us, with tomahawk and knife resting lightly in their\nbelts.\n\nAs for us, we walked slowly, smiled freely, and spoke frankly. The\nsunshine streaming down in the spaces where the trees fell away was not\nbrighter than our mood. Had we not smoked the peace pipe? Were we not\non our way home? Diccon, walking behind me, fell into a low-voiced\nconversation with the savage who strode beside him. It related to the\nbarter for a dozen otterskins of a gun which he had at Jamestown. The\nsavage was to bring the skins to Paspahegh at his earliest convenience,\nand Diccon would meet him there and give him the gun, provided the pelts\nwere to his liking. As they talked, each, in his mind's eye, saw the\nother dead before him. The one meant to possess a gun, indeed, but he\nthought to take it himself from the munition house at Jamestown; the\nother knew that the otter which died not until this Indian's arrow\nquivered in its side would live until doomsday. Yet they discussed the\nmatter gravely, hedging themselves about with provisos, and, the\nbargain clinched, walked on side by side in the silence of a perfect and\nall-comprehending amity.\n\nThe sun rode higher and higher, gilding the misty green of the budding\ntrees, quickening the red maple bloom into fierce scarlet, throwing\nlances of light down through the pine branches to splinter against the\ndark earth far below. For an hour it shone; then clouds gathered and\nshut it from sight. The forest darkened, and the wind arose with\na shriek. The young trees cowered before the blast, the strong and\nvigorous beat their branches together with a groaning sound, the old and\nworn fell crashing to the earth. Presently the rain rushed down, slant\nlines of silver tearing through the wood with the sound of the feet of\nan army; hail followed, a torrent of ice beating and bruising all tender\ngreen things to the earth. The wind took the multitudinous sounds,--the\ncries of frightened birds, the creaking trees, the snap of breaking\nboughs, the crash of falling giants, the rush of the rain, the drumming\nof the hail,--enwound them with itself, and made the forest like a great\nshell held close to the ear.\n\nThere was no house to flee to; so long as we could face the hail we\nstaggered on, heads down, buffeting the wind; but at last, the fury of\nthe storm increasing, we were fain to throw ourselves upon the earth,\nin a little brake, where an overhanging bank somewhat broke the wind. A\nmighty oak, swaying and groaning above us, might fall and crush us like\neggshells; but if we went on, the like fate might meet us in the way.\nBroken and withered limbs, driven by the wind, went past us like crooked\nshadows; it grew darker and darker, and the air was deadly cold.\n\nThe three Indians pressed their faces against the ground; they dreamed\nnot of harm from us, but Okee was in the merciless hail and the first\nthunder of the year, now pealing through the wood. Suddenly Diccon\nraised himself upon his elbow, and looked across at me. Our eyes had\nno sooner met than his hand was at his bosom. The savage nearest him,\nfeeling the movement, as it were, lifted his head from the earth, of\nwhich it was so soon to become a part; but if he saw the knife, he saw\nit too late. The blade, driven down with all the strength of a desperate\nman, struck home; when it was drawn from its sheath of flesh, there\nremained to us but a foe apiece.\n\nIn the instant of its descent I had thrown myself upon the Indian\nnearest me. It was not a time for overniceness. If I could have done so,\nI would have struck him in the back while he thought no harm; as it was,\nsome subtle instinct warning him, he whirled himself over in time to\nstrike up my hand and to clench with me. He was very strong, and his\nnaked body, wet with rain, slipped like a snake from my hold. Over and\nover we rolled on the rain-soaked moss and rotted leaves and cold black\nearth, the hail blinding us, and the wind shrieking like a thousand\nwatching demons. He strove to reach the knife within his belt; I, to\nprevent him, and to strike deep with the knife I yet held.\n\nAt last I did so. Blood gushed over my hand and wrist, the clutch upon\nmy arm relaxed, the head fell back. The dying eyes glared into mine;\nthen the lids shut forever upon that unquenchable hatred. I staggered to\nmy feet and turned, to find that Diccon had given account of the third\nIndian.\n\nWe stood up in the hail and the wind, and looked at the dead men at\nour feet. Then, without speaking, we went our way through the tossing\nforest, with the hailstones coming thick against us, and the wind a\nstrong hand to push us back. When we came to a little trickling spring,\nwe knelt and washed our hands.\n\nThe hail ceased, but the rain fell and the wind blew throughout the\nmorning. We made what speed we could over the boggy earth against the\nstorm, but we knew that we were measuring miles where we should have\nmeasured leagues. There was no breath to waste in words, and thought\nwas a burden quite intolerable; it was enough to stumble on through\nthe partial light, with a mind as gray and blank as the rain-blurred\ndistance.\n\nAt noon the clouds broke, and an hour later the sunshine was streaming\ndown from a cloudless heaven, beneath which the forest lay clear before\nus, naught stirring save shy sylvan creatures to whom it mattered not if\nred man or white held the land.\n\nSide by side Diccon and I hurried on, not speaking, keeping eye and ear\nopen, proposing with all our will to reach the goal we had set, and\nto reach it in time, let what might oppose. It was but another forced\nmarch; many had we made in our time, through dangers manifold, and had\nlived to tell the tale.\n\nThere was no leisure in which to play the Indian and cover up our\nfootprints as we made them, but when we came to a brook we stepped into\nthe cold, swift-flowing water, and kept it company for a while.\nThe brook flowed between willows, thickly set, already green, and\noverarching a yard or more of water. Presently it bent sharply, and we\nturned with it. Ten yards in front of us the growth of willows ceased\nabruptly, the low, steep banks shelved downwards to a grassy level,\nand the stream widened into a clear and placid pool, as blue as the sky\nabove. Crouched upon the grass or standing in the shallow water were\nsome fifteen or twenty deer. We had come upon them without noise; the\nwind blew from them to us, and the willows hid us from their sight.\nThere was no alarm, and we stood a moment watching them before we should\nthrow a stone or branch into their midst and scare them from our path.\n\nSuddenly, as we looked, the leader threw up his head, made a spring, and\nwas off like a dart, across the stream and into the depths of the forest\nbeyond. The herd followed. A moment, and there were only the trodden\ngrass and the troubled waters; no other sign that aught living had\npassed that way.\n\n\"Now what was that for?\" muttered Diccon. \"I'm thinking we had best not\ntake to the open just yet.\"\n\nFor answer I parted the willows, and forced myself into the covert,\npressing as closely as possible against the bank, and motioning him to\ndo the same. He obeyed, and the thick-clustering gold-green twigs swung\ninto place again, shutting us in with the black water and the leafy,\ncrumbling bank. From that green dimness we could look out upon the pool\nand the grass, with small fear that we ourselves would be seen.\n\nOut of the shadow of the trees into the grassy space stepped an Indian;\na second followed, a third, a fourth,--one by one they came from the\ngloom into the sunlight, until we had counted a score or more. They made\nno pause, a glance telling them to what were due the trampled grass and\nthe muddied water. As they crossed the stream one stooped and drank\nfrom his hand, but they said no word and made no noise. All were painted\nblack; a few had face and chest striped with yellow. Their headdresses\nwere tall and wonderful, their leggings and moccasins fringed with scalp\nlocks; their hatchets glinted in the sunshine, and their quivers were\nstuck full of arrows. One by one they glided from the stream into the\nthick woods beyond. We waited until we knew that they were were deep in\nthe forest, then crept from the willows and went our way.\n\n\"They were Youghtenunds,\" I said, in the low tones we used when we spoke\nat all, \"and they went to the southward.\"\n\n\"We may thank our stars that they missed our trail,\" Diccon answered.\n\nWe spoke no more, but, leaving the stream, struck again toward the\nsouth. The day wore on, and still we went without pause. Sun and shade\nand keen wind, long stretches of pine and open glades where we quickened\nour pace to a run, dense woods, snares of leafless vines, swamp and\nthicket through which we toiled so slowly that the heart bled at the\ndelay, streams and fallen trees,--on and on we hurried, until the sun\nsank and the dusk came creeping in upon us.\n\n\"We've dined with Duke Humphrey to-day,\" said Diccon at last; \"but if we\ncan keep this pace, and don't meet any more war parties, or fall foul of\nan Indian village, or have to fight the wolves to-night, we'll dine with\nthe Governor to-morrow. What's that?\"\n\n\"That\" was the report of a musket, and a spent ball had struck me above\nthe knee, bruising the flesh beneath the leather of my boot.\n\nWe wheeled, and looked in the direction whence lead come that unwelcome\nvisitor. There was naught to be seen. It was dusk in the distance,\nand there were thickets too, and fallen logs. Where that ambuscade was\nplanted, if one or twenty Indians lurked in the dusk behind the trees,\nor lay on the further side of those logs, or crouched within a thicket,\nno mortal man could tell.\n\n\"It was a spent ball,\" I said. \"Our best hope is in our heels.\"\n\n\"There are pines beyond, and smooth going,\" he answered; \"but if ever I\nthought to run from an Indian!\"\n\nWithout more ado we started. If we could outstrip that marksman, if we\ncould even hold our distance until night had fallen, all might yet be\nwell. A little longer, and even an Indian must fire at random; moreover,\nwe might reach some stream and manage to break our trail. The ground was\nsmooth before us,--too smooth, and slippery with pine needles; the pines\nthemselves stood in grim brown rows, and we ran between them lightly and\neasily, husbanding our strength. Now and again one or the other looked\nbehind, but we saw only the pines and the gathering dusk. Hope was\nstrengthening in us, when a second bullet dug into the earth just beyond\nus.\n\nDiccon swore beneath his breath. \"It struck deep,\" he muttered. \"The\ndark is slow in coming.\"\n\nA minute later, as I ran with my head over my shoulder, I saw our\npursuer, dimly, like a deeper shadow in the shadows far down the arcade\nbehind us. There was but one man,--a tall warrior, strayed aside from\nhis band, perhaps, or bound upon a warpath of his own. The musket that\nhe carried some English fool had sold him for a mess of pottage.\n\nPutting forth all our strength, we ran for our lives, and for the lives\nof many others. Before us the pine wood sloped down to a deep and wide\nthicket, and beyond the thicket a line of sycamores promised water. If\nwe could reach the thicket, its close embrace would hide us,--then the\ndarkness and the stream. A third shot, and Diccon staggered slightly.\n\n\"For God's sake, not struck, man?\" I cried.\n\n\"It grazed my arm,\" he panted. \"No harm done. Here's the thicket!\"\n\nInto the dense growth we broke, reckless of the blood which the sharp\ntwigs drew from face and hands. The twigs met in a thick roof over our\nheads; that was all we cared for, and through the network we saw one of\nthe larger stars brighten into being. The thicket was many yards across.\nWhen we had gone thirty feet down we crouched and waited for the dark.\nIf our enemy followed us, he must do so at his peril, with only his\nknife for dependence.\n\nOne by one the stars swam into sight, until the square of sky above us\nwas thickly studded. There was no sound, and no living thing could have\nentered that thicket without noise. For what seemed an eternity,\nwe waited; then we rose and broke our way through the bushes to the\nsycamores, to find that they indeed shadowed a little sluggish stream.\n\nDown this we waded for some distance before taking to dry earth again.\nSince entering the thicket we had seen and heard nothing suspicious,\nand were now fain to conclude that the dark warrior had wearied of the\nchase, and was gone on his way toward his mates and that larger and\nsurer quarry which two suns would bring. Certain it is that we saw no\nmore of him.\n\nThe stream flowing to the south, we went with it, hurrying along its\nbank, beneath the shadow of great trees, with the stars gleaming down\nthrough the branches. It was cold and still, and far in the distance we\nheard wolves hunting. As for me, I felt no weariness. Every sense\nwas sharpened; my feet were light; the keen air was like wine in the\ndrinking; there was a star low in the south that shone and beckoned. The\nleagues between my wife and me were few. I saw her standing beneath the\nstar, with a little purple flower in her hand.\n\nSuddenly, a bend in the stream hiding the star, I became aware that\nDiccon was no longer keeping step with me, but had fallen somewhat to\nthe rear. I turned, and he was leaning heavily, with drooping head,\nagainst the trunk of a tree.\n\n\"Art so worn as that?\" I exclaimed. \"Put more heart into thy heels,\nman!\"\n\nHe straightened himself and strode on beside me. \"I don't know what came\nover me for a minute,\" he answered. \"The wolves are loud to-night. I\nhope they'll keep to their side of the water.\"\n\nA stone's throw farther on, the stream curving to the west, we left it,\nand found ourselves in a sparsely wooded glade, with a bare and sandy\nsoil beneath our feet, and above, in the western sky, a crescent moon.\nAgain Diccon lagged behind, and presently I heard him groan in the\ndarkness.\n\nI wheeled. \"Diccon!\" I cried. \"What is the matter?\"\n\nBefore I could reach him he had sunk to his knees. When I put my hand\nupon his arm and again demanded what ailed him, he tried to laugh, then\ntried to swear, and ended with another groan. \"The ball did graze my\narm,\" he said, \"but it went on into my side. I'll just lie here and\ndie, and wish you well at Jamestown. When the red imps come against you\nthere, and you open fire on them, name a bullet for me.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV IN WHICH I COME TO THE GOVERNOR'S HOUSE\n\n\nI LAID him down upon the earth, and, cutting away his doublet and the\nshirt beneath, saw the wound, and knew that there was a journey indeed\nthat he would shortly make. \"The world is turning round,\" he muttered,\n\"and the stars are falling thicker than the hailstones yesterday. Go on,\nand I will stay behind,--I and the wolves.\"\n\nI took him in my arms and carried him back to the bank of the stream,\nfor I knew that he would want water until he died. My head was bare, but\nhe had worn his cap from the gaol at Jamestown that night. I filled it\nwith water and gave him to drink; then washed the wound and did what I\ncould to stanch the bleeding. He turned from side to side, and presently\nhis mind began to wander, and he talked of the tobacco in the fields\nat Weyanoke. Soon he was raving of old things, old camp fires and\nnight-time marches and wild skirmishes, perils by land and by sea; then\nof dice and wine and women. Once he cried out that Dale had bound him\nupon the wheel, and that his arms and legs were broken, and the woods\nrang to his screams. Why, in that wakeful forest, they were unheard, or\nwhy, if heard, they went unheeded, God only knows.\n\nThe moon went down, and it was very cold. How black were the shadows\naround us, what foes might steal from that darkness upon us, it was not\nworth while to consider. I do not know what I thought of on that night,\nor even that I thought at all. Between my journeys for the water that he\ncalled for I sat beside the dying man with my hand upon his breast, for\nhe was quieter so. Now and then I spoke to him, but he answered not.\n\nHours before we had heard the howling of wolves, and knew that some\nravenous pack was abroad. With the setting of the moon the noise had\nceased, and I thought that the brutes had pulled down the deer they\nhunted, or else had gone with their hunger and their dismal voices out\nof earshot. Suddenly the howling recommenced, at first faint and far\naway, then nearer and nearer yet. Earlier in the evening the stream had\nbeen between us, but now the wolves had crossed and were coming down our\nside of the water, and were coming fast.\n\nAll the ground was strewn with dead wood, and near by was a growth of\nlow and brittle bushes. I gathered the withered branches, and broke\nfagots from the bushes; then into the press of dark and stealthy forms I\nthrew a great crooked stick, shouting as I did so, and threatening with\nmy arms. They turned and fled, but presently they were back again. Again\nI frightened them away, and again they returned. I had flint and steel\nand tinder box; when I had scared them from us a third time, and they\nhad gone only a little way, I lit a splinter of pine, and with it fired\nmy heap of wood; then dragged Diccon into the light and sat down beside\nhim, with no longer any fear of the wolves, but with absolute confidence\nin the quick appearance of less cowardly foes. There was wood enough and\nto spare; when the fire sank low and the hungry eyes gleamed nearer, I\nfed it again, and the flame leaped up and mocked the eyes.\n\nNo human enemy came upon us. The fire blazed and roared, and the man who\nlay in its rosy glare raved on, crying out now and then at the top of\nhis voice; but on that night of all nights, of all years, light and\nvoice drew no savage band to put out the one and silence the other\nforever.\n\nHours passed, and as it drew toward midnight Diccon sank into a stupor.\nI knew that the end was not far away. The wolves were gone at last, and\nmy fire was dying down. He needed my touch upon his breast no longer,\nand I went to the stream and bathed my hands and forehead, and then\nthrew myself face downward upon the bank. In a little while the desolate\nmurmur of the water became intolerable, and I rose and went back to the\nfire, and to the man whom, as God lives, I loved as a brother.\n\nHe was conscious. Pale and cold and nigh gone as he was, there came a\nlight to his eyes and a smile to his lips when I knelt beside him. \"You\ndid not go?\" he breathed.\n\n\"No,\" I answered, \"I did not go.\"\n\nFor a few minutes he lay with closed eyes; when he again opened them\nupon my face, there were in their depths a question and an appeal. I\nbent over him, and asked him what he would have.\n\n\"You know,\" he whispered. \"If you can... I would not go without it.\"\n\n\"Is it that?\" I asked. \"I forgave you long ago.\"\n\n\"I meant to kill you. I was mad because you struck me before the lady,\nand because I had betrayed my trust. An you had not caught my hand,\nI should be your murderer.\" He spoke with long intervals between the\nwords, and the death dew was on his forehead.\n\n\"Remember it not, Diccon,\" I entreated. \"I too was to blame. And I see\nnot that night for other nights,--for other nights and days, Diccon.\"\n\nHe smiled, but there was still in his face a shadowy eagerness. \"You\nsaid you would never strike me again,\" he went on, \"and that I was man\nof yours no more forever--and you gave me my freedom in the paper which\nI tore.\" He spoke in gasps, with his eyes upon mine. \"I'll be gone in\na few minutes now. If I might go as your man still, and could tell the\nLord Jesus Christ that my master on earth forgave, and took back, it\nwould be a hand in the dark. I have spent my life in gathering darkness\nfor myself at the last.\"\n\nI bent lower over him, and took his hand in mine. \"Diccon, my man,\" I\nsaid.\n\nA brightness came into his face, and he faintly pressed my hand. I\nslipped my arm beneath him and raised him a little higher to meet his\ndeath. He was smiling now, and his mind was not quite clear. \"Do you\nmind, sir,\" he asked, \"how green and strong and sweet smelled the pines\nthat May day, when we found Virginia, so many years ago?\"\n\n\"Ay, Diccon,\" I answered. \"Before we saw the land, the fragrance told us\nwe were near it.\"\n\n\"I smell it now,\" he went on, \"and the bloom of the grape, and the\nMay-time flowers. And can you not hear, sir, the whistling and the\nlaughter and the sound of the falling trees, that merry time when Smith\nmade axemen of all our fine gentlemen?\"\n\n\"Ay, Diccon,\" I said. \"And the sound of the water that was dashed down\nthe sleeve of any that were caught in an oath.\"\n\nHe laughed like a little child. \"It is well that I was n't a gentleman,\nand had not those trees to fell, or I should have been as wet as any\nmerman.... And Pocahontas, the little maid... and how blue the sky was,\nand how glad we were what time the Patience and Deliverance came in!\"\n\nHis voice failed, and for a minute I thought he was gone; but he had\nbeen a strong man, and life slipped not easily from him. When his eyes\nopened again he knew me not, but thought he was in some tavern, and\nstruck with his hand upon the ground as upon a table, and called for the\ndrawer.\n\nAround him were only the stillness and the shadows of the night, but\nto his vision men sat and drank with him, diced and swore and told wild\ntales of this or that. For a time he talked loudly and at random of the\nvile quality of the drink, and his viler luck at the dice; then he began\nto tell a story. As he told it, his senses seemed to steady, and he\nspoke with coherence and like a shadow of himself.\n\n\"And you call that a great thing, William Host?\" he demanded. \"I can\ntell a true tale worth two such lies, my masters. (Robin tapster, more\nale! And move less like a slug, or my tankard and your ear will cry,\n'Well met!') It was between Ypres and Courtrai, friends, and it's nigh\nfifteen years ago. There were fields in which nothing was sowed because\nthey were ploughed with the hoofs of war horses, and ditches in which\ndead men were thrown, and dismal marshes, and roads that were no roads\nat all, but only sloughs. And there was a great stone house, old and\nruinous, with tall poplars shivering in the rain and mist. Into this\nhouse there threw themselves a band of Dutch and English, and hard\non their heels came two hundred Spaniards. All day they besieged that\nhouse,--smoke and flame and thunder and shouting and the crash of\nmasonry,--and when eventide was come we, the Dutch and the English,\nthought that Death was not an hour behind.\"\n\nHe paused, and made a gesture of raising a tankard to his lips. His\neyes were bright, his voice was firm. The memory of that old day and its\nmortal strife had wrought upon him like wine.\n\n\"There was one amongst us,\" he said, \"he was our captain, and it's of\nhim I am going to tell the story. Robin tapster, bring me no more ale,\nbut good mulled wine! It's cold and getting dark, and I have to drink to\na brave man besides\"--\n\nWith the old bold laugh in his eyes, he raised himself, for the moment\nas strong as I that held him. \"Drink to that Englishman, all of ye!\" he\ncried, \"and not in filthy ale, but in good, gentlemanly sack! I'll pay\nthe score. Here's to him, brave hearts! Here's to my master!\"\n\nWith his hand at his mouth, and his story untold, he fell back. I held\nhim in my arms until the brief struggle was over, and then laid his body\ndown upon the earth.\n\nIt might have been one of the clock. For a little while I sat beside\nhim, with my head bowed in my hands. Then I straightened his limbs and\ncrossed his hands upon his breast, and kissed him upon the brow, and\nleft him lying dead in the forest.\n\nIt was hard going through the blackness of the night-time woods. Once\nI was nigh sucked under in a great swamp, and once I stumbled into some\nhole or pit in the earth, and for a time thought that I had broken my\nleg. The night was very dark, and sometimes when I could not see the\nstars, I lost my way, and went to the right or the left, or even back\nupon my track. Though I heard the wolves, they did not come nigh me.\nJust before daybreak, I crouched behind a log, and watched a party of\nsavages file past like shadows of the night.\n\nAt last the dawn came, and I could press on more rapidly. For two days\nand two nights I had not slept; for a day and a night I had not tasted\nfood. As the sun climbed the heavens, a thousand black spots, like\nsummer gnats, danced between his face and my weary eyes. The forest laid\nstumbling-blocks before me, and drove me back, and made me wind in and\nout when I would have had my path straighter than an arrow. When\nthe ground allowed I ran; when I must break my way, panting, through\nundergrowth so dense and stubborn that it seemed some enchanted thicket,\nwhere each twig snapped but to be on the instant stiff in place again, I\nbroke it with what patience I might; when I must turn aside for this\nor that obstacle I made the detour, though my heart cried out at the\nnecessity. Once I saw reason to believe that two or more Indians were\nupon my trail, and lost time in outwitting them; and once I must go a\nmile out of my way to avoid an Indian village.\n\nAs the day wore on, I began to go as in a dream. It had come to seem the\ngigantic wood of some fantastic tale through which I was traveling.\nThe fallen trees ranged themselves into an abatis hard to surmount; the\nthickets withstood one like iron; the streamlets were like rivers, the\nmarshes leagues wide, the treetops miles away. Little things, twisted\nroots, trailing vines, dead and rotten wood, made me stumble. A wind\nwas blowing that had blown just so since time began, and the forest was\nfilled with the sound of the sea.\n\nAfternoon came, and the shadows began to lengthen. They were lines of\nblack paint spilt in a thousand places, and stealing swiftly and surely\nacross the brightness of the land. Torn and bleeding and breathless, I\nhastened on; for it was drawing toward night, and I should have been at\nJamestown hours before. My head pained me, and as I ran I saw men and\nwomen stealing in and out among the trees before me: Pocahontas with her\nwistful eyes and braided hair and finger on her lips; Nantauquas; Dale,\nthe knight-marshal, and Argall with his fierce, unscrupulous face;\nmy cousin George Percy, and my mother with her stately figure, her\nembroidery in her hands. I knew that they were but phantoms of my brain,\nbut their presence confused and troubled me.\n\nThe shadows ran together, and the sunshine died out of the forest.\nStumbling on, I saw through the thinning trees a long gleam of red, and\nthought it was blood, but presently knew that it was the river, crimson\nfrom the sunset. A minute more and I stood upon the shore of the mighty\nstream, between the two brightnesses of flood and heavens. There was\na silver crescent in the sky with one white star above it, and fair in\nsight, down the James, with lights springing up through the twilight,\nwas the town,--the English town that we had built and named for our\nKing, and had held in the teeth of Spain, in the teeth of the wilderness\nand its terrors. It was not a mile away; a little longer,--a little\nlonger and I could rest, with my tidings told.\n\nThe dusk had quite fallen when I reached the neck of land. The hut to\nwhich I had been enticed that night stood dark and ghastly, with its\ndoor swinging in the wind. I ran past it and across the neck, and,\narriving at the palisade, beat upon the gate with my hands, and called\nto the warder to open. When I had told him my name and tidings, he did\nso, with shaking knees and starting eyes. Cautioning him to raise no\nalarm in the town, I hurried by him into the street, and down it toward\nthe house that was set aside for the Governor of Virginia. I should find\nthere now, not Yeardley, but Sir Francis Wyatt.\n\nThe torches were lighted, and the folk were indoors, for the night was\ncold. One or two figures that I met or passed would have accosted me,\nnot knowing who I was, but I brushed by them, and hastened on. Only when\nI passed the guest house I looked up, and saw that mine host's chief\nrooms were yet in use.\n\nThe Governor's door was open, and in the hall servingmen were moving\nto and fro. When I came in upon them, they cried out as it had been a\nghost, and one fellow let a silver dish that he carried fall clattering\nto the floor. They shook and stood back, as I passed them without a\nword, and went on to the Governor's great room. The door was ajar, and I\npushed it open and stood for a minute upon the threshold, unobserved by\nthe occupants of the room.\n\nAfter the darkness outside the lights dazzled me; the room, too, seemed\ncrowded with men, though when I counted them there were not so many,\nafter all. Supper had been put upon the table, but they were not eating.\nBefore the fire, his head thoughtfully bent, and his fingers tapping\nupon the arm of his chair, sat the Governor; over against him, and as\nserious of aspect, was the Treasurer. West stood by the mantel, tugging\nat his long mustaches and softly swearing. Clayborne was in the room,\nPiersey the Cape Merchant, and one or two besides. And Rolfe was there,\nwalking up and down with hasty steps, and a flushed and haggard\nface. His suit of buff was torn and stained, and his great-boots were\nspattered with mud.\n\nThe Governor let his fingers rest upon the arm of his chair, and raised\nhis head.\n\n\"He is dead, Master Rolfe,\" he said. \"There can be no other\nconclusion,--a brave man lost to you and to the colony. We mourn with\nyou, sir.\"\n\n\"We too have searched, Jack,\" put in West. \"We have not been idle,\nthough well-nigh all men believe that the Indians, who we know had a\ngrudge against him, murdered him and his man that night, then threw\ntheir bodies into the river, and themselves made off out of our reach.\nBut we hoped against hope that when your party returned he would be in\nyour midst.\"\n\n\"As for this latest loss,\" continued the Governor, \"within an hour\nof its discovery this morning search parties were out; yea, if I had\nallowed it, the whole town would have betaken itself to the woods. The\nsearchers have not returned, and we are gravely anxious. Yet we are not\nutterly cast down. This trail can hardly be missed, and the Indians are\nfriendly. There were a number in town overnight, and they went with the\nsearchers, volunteering to act as their guides. We cannot but think that\nof this load, our hearts will soon be eased.\"\n\n\"God grant it!\" groaned Rolfe. \"I will drink but a cup of wine, sir, and\nthen will be gone upon this new quest.\"\n\nThere was a movement in the room. \"You are worn and spent with your\nfruitless travel, sir,\" said the Governor kindly. \"I give you my word\nthat all that can be done is doing. Wait at least for the morning, and\nthe good news it may bring.\"\n\nThe other shook his head. \"I will go now. I could not look my friend in\nthe face else--God in heaven!\"\n\nThe Governor sprang to his feet; through the Treasurer's lips came a\nlong, sighing breath; West's dark face was ashen. I came forward to the\ntable, and leaned my weight upon it; for all the waves of the sea were\nroaring in my ears, and the lights were going up and down.\n\n\"Are you man or spirit?\" cried Rolfe through white lips. \"Are you Ralph\nPercy?\"\n\n\"Yes, I am Percy,\" I said. \"I have not well understood what quest you\nwould go upon, Rolfe, but you cannot go to-night. And those parties that\nyour Honor talked of, that have gone with Indians to guide them to look\nfor some lost person,--I think that you will never see them again.\"\n\nWith an effort I drew myself erect, and standing so told my tidings,\nquietly and with circumstance, so as to leave no room for doubt as\nto their verity, or as to the sanity of him who brought them. They\nlistened, as the warder had listened, with shaking limbs and gasping\nbreath; for this was the fall and wiping out of a people of which I\nbrought warning.\n\nWhen all was told, and they stood there before me, white and shaken,\nseeking in their minds the thing to say or do first, I thought to ask a\nquestion myself; but before my tongue could frame it, the roaring of the\nsea became so loud that I could hear naught else, and the lights all ran\ntogether into a wheel of fire. Then in a moment all sounds ceased, and\nto the lights succeeded the blackness of outer darkness.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI IN WHICH I HEAR ILL NEWS\n\n\nWHEN I awoke from the sleep or stupor into which I must have passed from\nthat swoon, it was to find myself lying upon a bed in a room flooded\nwith sunshine. I was alone. For a moment I lay still, staring at the\nblue sky without the window, and wondering where I was and how I\ncame there. A drum beat, a dog barked, and a man's quick voice gave a\ncommand. The sounds stung me into remembrance, and I was at the window\nwhile the voice was yet speaking.\n\nIt was West in the street below, pointing with his sword now to the\nfort, now to the palisade, and giving directions to the armed men about\nhim. There were many people in the street. Women hurried by to the\nfort with white, scared faces, their arms filled with household gear;\nchildren ran beside them, sturdily bearing their share of the goods, but\npressing close to their elders' skirts; men went to and fro, the most\ngrimly silent, but a few talking loudly. Not all of the faces in the\ncrowd belonged to the town: there were Kingsmell and his wife from the\nmain, and John Ellison from Archer's Hope, and the Italians Vincencio\nand Bernardo from the Glass House. The nearer plantations, then, had\nbeen warned, and their people had come for refuge to the city. A negro\npassed, but on that morning, alone of many days, no Indian aired his\npaint and feathers in the white man's village.\n\nI could not see the palisade across the neck, but I knew that it was\nthere that the fight--if fight there were--would be made. Should the\nIndians take the palisade, there would yet be the houses of the town,\nand, last of all, the fort in which to make a stand. I believed not that\nthey would take it. Long since we had found out their method of warfare.\nThey used ambuscade, surprise, and massacre; when withstood in force and\nwith determination they withdrew to their stronghold the forest, there\nto bide their time until, in the blackness of some night, they could\nagain swoop down upon a sleeping foe.\n\nThe drum beat again, and a messenger from the palisade came down the\nstreet at a run. \"They're in the woods over against us, thicker than\nants!\" he cried to West as he passed. \"A boat has just drifted ashore\nyonder, with two men in it, dead and scalped!\"\n\nI turned to leave the room, and ran against Master Pory coming in on\ntiptoe, with a red and solemn face. He started when he saw me.\n\n\"The roll of the drum brought you to your feet, then!\" he cried. \"You've\nlain like the dead all night. I came but to see if you were breathing.\"\n\n\"When I have eaten, I shall be myself again,\" I said. \"There's no attack\nas yet?\"\n\n\"No,\" he answered. \"They must know that we are prepared. But they\nhave kindled fires along the river bank, and we can hear them yelling.\nWhether they'll be mad enough to come against us remains to be seen.\"\n\n\"The nearest settlements have been warned?\"\n\n\"Ay. The Governor offered a thousand pounds of tobacco and the perpetual\nesteem of the Company to the man or men who would carry the news. Six\nvolunteered, and went off in boats, three up river, three down. How\nmany they reached, or if they still have their scalps, we know not. And\nawhile ago, just before daybreak, comes with frantic haste Richard\nPace, who had rowed up from Pace's Pains to tell the news which you had\nalready brought. Chanco the Christian had betrayed the plot to him, and\nhe managed to give warning at Powel's and one or two other places as he\ncame up the river.\"\n\nHe broke off, but when I would have spoken interrupted me with: \"And so\nyou were on the Pamunkey all this while! Then the Paspaheghs fooled us\nwith the simple truth, for they swore so stoutly that their absent chief\nmen were but gone on a hunt toward the Pamunkey that we had no choice\nbut to believe them gone in quite another direction. And one and all of\nevery tribe we questioned swore that Opechancanough was at Orapax. So\nMaster Rolfe puts off up river to find, if not you, then the Emperor,\nand make him give up your murderers; and the Governor sends a party\nalong the bay, and West another up the Chickahominy. And there you were,\nall the time, mewed up in the village above the marshes! And Nantauquas,\nafter saving our lives like one of us, is turned Indian again! And your\nman is killed! Alackaday! there's naught but trouble in the world. 'As\nthe sparks fly upwards,' you know. But a brave man draws his breath and\nsets his teeth.\"\n\nIn his manner, his rapid talk, his uneasy glances toward the door, I\nfound something forced and strange. \"I thought Rolfe was behind me,\" he\nsaid, \"but he must have been delayed. There are meat and drink set out\nin the great room, where the Governor and those of the Council who\nare safe here with us are advising together. Let's descend; you've not\neaten, and the good sack will give you strength. Wilt come?\"\n\n\"Ay,\" I answered, \"but tell me the news as we go. I have been gone ten\ndays,--faith, it seems ten years! There have no ships sailed, Master\nPory? The George is still here?\" I looked him full in the eye, for a\nsudden guess at a possible reason for his confusion had stabbed me like\na knife.\n\n\"Ay,\" he said, with a readiness that could scarce be feigned. \"She was\nto have sailed this week, it is true, the Governor fearing to keep\nher longer. But the Esperance, coming in yesterday, brought news which\nremoved his Honor's scruples. Now she'll wait to see out this hand at\nthe cards, and to take home the names of those who are left alive\nin Virginia. If the red varlets do swarm in upon us, there are her\ntwelve-pounders; they and the fort guns\"--\n\nI let him talk on. The George had not sailed. I saw again a firelit\nhut, and a man and a panther who went down together. Those claws had dug\ndeep; the man across whose face they had torn their way would keep his\nroom in the guest house at Jamestown until his wounds were somewhat\nhealed. The George would wait for him, would scarcely dare to sail\nwithout him, and I should find the lady whom she was to carry away to\nEngland in Virginia still. It was this that I had built upon, the\ngrain of comfort, the passionate hope, the sustaining cordial, of those\nyear-long days in the village above the Pamunkey.\n\nMy heart was sore because of Diccon; but I could speak of that grief to\nher, and she would grieve with me. There were awe and dread and stern\nsorrow in the knowledge that even now in the bright spring morning blood\nfrom a hundred homes might be flowing to meet the shining, careless\nriver; but it was the springtime, and she was waiting for me. I strode\non toward the stairway so fast that when I asked a question Master Pory,\nat my side, was too out of breath to answer it. Halfway down the stairs\nI asked it again, and again received no answer save a \"Zooks! you go\ntoo fast for my years and having in flesh! Go more slowly, Ralph Percy;\nthere's time enough, there's time enough!\"\n\nThere was a tone in his voice that I liked not, for it savored of pity.\nI looked at him with knitted brows; but we were now in the hall, and\nthrough the open door of the great room I caught a glimpse of a woman's\nskirt. There were men in the hall, servants and messengers, who made\nway for us, staring at me as they did so, and whispering. I knew that\nmy clothing was torn and muddied and stained with blood; as we paused\nat the door there came to me in a flash that day in the courting meadow\nwhen I had tried with my dagger to scrape the dried mud from my boots.\nI laughed at myself for caring now, and for thinking that she would care\nthat I was not dressed for a lady's bower. The next moment we were in\nthe great room.\n\nShe was not there. The silken skirt that I had seen, and--there being\nbut one woman in all the world for me--had taken for hers, belonged to\nLady Wyatt, who, pale and terrified, was sitting with clasped hands,\nmutely following with her eyes her husband as he walked to and fro. West\nhad come in from the street and was making some report. Around the table\nwere gathered two or three of the Council; Master Sandys stood at\na window, Rolfe beside Lady Wyatt's chair. The room was filled with\nsunshine, and a caged bird was singing, singing. It made the only sound\nthere when they saw that I stood amongst them.\n\nWhen I had made my bow to Lady Wyatt and to the Governor, and had\nclasped hands with Rolfe, I began to find in the silence, as I had found\nin Master Pory's loquaciousness, something strange. They looked at me\nuneasily, and I caught a swift glance from the Treasurer to Master Pory,\nand an answering shake of the latter's head. Rolfe was very white and\nhis lips were set; West was pulling at his mustaches and staring at the\nfloor.\n\n\"With all our hearts we welcome you back to life and to the service of\nVirginia, Captain Percy,\" said the Governor, when the silence had become\nawkward.\n\nA murmur of assent went round the room.\n\nI bowed. \"I thank you, sir, and these gentlemen very heartily. You have\nbut to command me now. I find that I have to-day the best will in\nthe world toward fighting. I trust that your Honor does not deem it\nnecessary to send me back to gaol?\"\n\n\"Virginia has no gaol for Captain Percy,\" he answered gravely. \"She has\nonly grateful thanks and fullest sympathy.\"\n\nI glanced at him keenly. \"Then I hold myself at your command, sir, when\nI shall have seen and spoken with my wife.\"\n\nHe looked at the floor, and they one and all held their peace.\n\n\"Madam,\" I said to Lady Wyatt, \"I have been watching your ladyship's\nface. Will you tell me why it is so very full of pity, and why there are\ntears in your eyes?\"\n\nShe shrank back in her chair with a little cry, and Rolfe stepped toward\nme, then turned sharply aside. \"I cannot!\" he cried, \"I that know\"--\n\nI drew myself up to meet the blow, whatever it might be. \"I demand of\nyou my wife, Sir Francis Wyatt,\" I said. \"If there is ill news to be\ntold, be so good as to tell it quickly. If she is sick, or hath been\nsent away to England\"--\n\nThe Governor made as if to speak, then turned and flung out his hands to\nhis wife. \"'T is woman's work, Margaret!\" he cried. \"Tell him!\"\n\nMore merciful than the men, she came to me at once, the tears running\ndown her cheeks, and laid one trembling hand upon my arm. \"She was a\nbrave lady, Captain Percy,\" she said. \"Bear it as she would have had you\nbear it.\"\n\n\"I am bearing it, madam,\" I answered at length. \"'She was a brave lady.'\nMay it please your ladyship to go on?\"\n\n\"I will tell you all, Captain Percy; I will tell you everything.... She\nnever believed you dead, and she begged upon her knees that we would\nallow her to go in search of you with Master Rolfe. That could not be;\nmy husband, in duty to the Company, could not let her have her will.\nMaster Rolfe went, and she sat in the window, yonder, day after day,\nwatching for his return. When other parties went out, she besought the\nmen, as they had wives whom they loved, to search as though those\nloved ones were in captivity and danger; when they grew weary and\nfainthearted, to think of her face waiting in the window.... Day after\nday she sat there watching for them to come back; when they were come,\nthen she watched the river for Master Rolfe's boats. Then came word down\nthe river that he had found no trace of you whom he sought, that he was\non his way back to Jamestown, that he too believed you dead.... We put\na watch upon her after that, for we feared we knew not what, there was\nsuch a light and purpose in her eyes. But two nights ago, in the middle\nof the night, the woman who stayed in her chamber fell asleep. When she\nawoke before the dawn, it was to find her gone.\"\n\n\"To find her gone?\" I said dully. \"To find her dead?\"\n\nShe locked her hands together and the tears came faster. \"Oh, Captain\nPercy, it had been better so!--it had been better so! Then would she\nhave lain to greet you, calm and white, unmarred and beautiful, with the\nspring flowers upon her.... She believed not that you were dead; she\nwas distraught with grief and watching; she thought that love might find\nwhat friendship missed; she went to the forest to seek you. They that\nwere sent to find and bring her back have never returned\"--\n\n\"Into the forest!\" I cried. \"Jocelyn, Jocelyn, Jocelyn, come back!\"\n\nSome one pushed me into a chair, and I felt the warmth of wine within my\nlips. In the moment that the world steadied I rose and went toward the\ndoor to find my way barred by Rolfe.\n\n\"Not you, too, Ralph!\" he cried. \"I will not let you go. Look for\nyourself!\"\n\nHe drew me to the window, Master Sandys gravely making place for us.\nFrom the window was visible the neck of land and the forest beyond, and\nfrom the forest, up and down the river as far as the eye could reach,\nrose here and there thin columns of smoke. Suddenly, as we stared,\nthree or four white smoke puffs, like giant flowers, started out of the\nshadowy woods across the neck. Following the crack of the muskets--fired\nout of pure bravado by their Indian owners--came the yelling of the\nsavages. The sound was prolonged and deep, as though issuing from many\nthroats.\n\nI looked and listened, and knew that I could not go,--not now.\n\n\"She was not alone, Ralph,\" said Rolfe, with his arm about me. \"On the\nmorning that she was missed, they found not Jeremy Sparrow either. They\ntracked them both to the forest by the footprints upon the sand,\nthough once in the wood the trail was lost. The minister must have been\nwatching, must have seen her leave the house, and must have followed\nher. How she, and he after her, passed through the gates, none know. So\ncareless and confident had we grown--God forgive us!--that they may have\nbeen left open all that night. But he was with her, Ralph; she had not\nto face it alone\"--His voice broke.\n\nFor myself, I was glad that the minister had been there, though I knew\nthat for him also I should grieve after a while.\n\nAt the firing and the shouting West had rushed from the room, followed\nby his fellow Councilors, and now the Governor clapped on his headpiece\nand called to his men to bring his back-and-breast. His wife hung around\nhis neck, and he bade her good-by with great tenderness. I looked dully\non at that parting. I too was going to battle. Once I had tasted such a\nfarewell, the pain, the passion, the sweetness, but never again,--never\nagain.\n\nHe went, and the Treasurer, after a few words of comfort to Lady Wyatt,\nwas gone also. Both were merciful, and spoke not to me, but only bowed\nand turned aside, requiring no answering word or motion of mine. When\nthey were away, and there was no sound in the room save the caged bird's\nsinging and Lady Wyatt's low sobs, I begged Rolfe to leave me, telling\nhim that he was needed, as indeed he was, and that I would stay in the\nwindow for a while, and then would join him at the palisade. He was\nloath to go; but he too had loved and lost, and knew that there is\nnothing to be said, and that it is best to be alone. He went, and only\nLady Wyatt and I kept the quiet room with the singing bird and the\nsunshine on the floor.\n\nI leaned against the window and looked out into the street,--which was\nnot crowded now, for the men were all at their several posts,--and at\nthe budding trees, and at the smoke of many fires going up from the\nforest to the sky, from a world of hate and pain and woe to the heaven\nwhere she dwelt, and then I turned and went to the table, where had been\nset bread and meat and wine.\n\nAt the sound of my footstep Lady Wyatt uncovered her face. \"Is there\naught that I can do for you, sir?\" she asked timidly.\n\n\"I have not broken my fast for many hours, madam,\" I answered. \"I would\neat and drink, that I may not be found wanting in strength. There is a\nthing that I have yet to do.\"\n\nRising from her chair, she brushed away her tears, and coming to the\ntable with a little housewifely eagerness would not let me wait upon\nmyself, but carved and poured for me, and then sat down opposite me and\ncovered her eyes with her hand.\n\n\"I think that the Governor is quite safe, madam,\" I said. \"I do not\nbelieve that the Indians will take the palisade. It may even be that,\nknowing we are prepared, they will not attack at all. Indeed, I think\nthat you may be easy about him.\"\n\nShe thanked me with a smile. \"It is all so strange and dreadful to me,\nsir,\" she said. \"At my home, in England, it was like a Sunday morning\nall the year round,--all stillness and peace; no terror, no alarm. I\nfear that I am not yet a good Virginian.\"\n\nWhen I had eaten, and had drunk the wine she gave me, I rose, and asked\nher if I might not see her safe within the fort before I joined her\nhusband at the palisade. She shook her head, and told me that there were\nwith her faithful servants, and that if the savages broke in upon the\ntown she would have warning in time to flee, the fort being so close at\nhand. When I thereupon begged her leave to depart, she first curtsied to\nme, and then, again with tears, came to me and took my hand in hers. \"I\nknow that there is naught that I can say.... Your wife loved you, sir,\nwith all her heart.\" She drew something from the bosom of her gown.\n\"Would you like this? It is a knot of ribbon that she wore. They found\nit caught in a bush at the edge of the forest.\"\n\nI took the ribbon from her and put it to my lips, then unknotted it and\ntied it around my arm; and then, wearing my wife's colors, I went softly\nout into the street, and turned my face toward the guest house and the\nman whom I meant to kill.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII IN WHICH MY LORD AND I PART COMPANY\n\n\nTHE door of the guest house stood wide, and within the lower room were\nneither men that drank nor men that gave to drink. Host and drawers and\nchance guests alike had left pipe and tankard for sword and musket, and\nwere gone to fort or palisade or river bank.\n\nI crossed the empty room and went up the creaking stairway. No one\nmet me or withstood me; only a pigeon perched upon the sill of a sunny\nwindow whirred off into the blue. I glanced out of the window as I\npassed it, and saw the silver river and the George and the Esperance,\nwith the gunners at the guns watching for Indian canoes, and saw smoke\nrising from the forest on the southern shore. There had been three\nhouses there,--John West's and Minifie's and Crashaw's. I wondered if\nmine were burning, too, at Weyanoke, and cared not if 't was so.\n\nThe door of the upper room was shut. When I raised the latch and pushed\nagainst it, it gave at the top and middle, but there was some pressure\nfrom within at the bottom. I pushed again, more strongly, and the door\nslowly opened, moving away whatever thing had lain before it. Another\nmoment, and I was in the room, and had closed and barred the door behind\nme.\n\nThe weight that had opposed me was the body of the Italian, lying face\ndownwards, upon the floor. I stooped and turned it over, and saw that\nthe venomous spirit had flown. The face was purple and distorted; the\nlips were drawn back from the teeth in a dreadful smile. There was in\nthe room a faint, peculiar, not unpleasant odor. It did not seem strange\nto me to find that serpent, which had coiled in my path, dead and\nharmless for evermore. Death had been busy of late; if he struck down\nthe flower, why should he spare the thing that I pushed out of my way\nwith my foot?\n\nTen feet from the door stood a great screen, hiding from view all that\nmight be beyond. It was very quiet in the room, with the sunshine coming\nthrough the window, and a breeze that smelt of the sea. I had not\ncared to walk lightly or to close the door softly, and yet no voice had\nchallenged my entrance. For a minute I feared to find the dead physician\nthe room's only occupant; then I passed the screen and came upon my\nenemy.\n\nHe was sitting beside a table, with his arms outstretched and his head\nbowed upon them. My footfall did not rouse him; he sat there in the\nsunshine as still as the figure that lay before the threshold. I thought\nwith a dull fury that maybe he was dead already, and I walked hastily\nand heavily across the floor to the table. He was a living man, for with\nthe fingers of one hand he was slowly striking against a sheet of\npaper that lay beneath them. He knew not that I stood above him; he was\nlistening to other footsteps.\n\nThe paper was a letter, unfolded and written over with great black\ncharacters. The few lines above those moving fingers stared me in the\nface. They ran thus: \"I told you that you had as well cut your throat\nas go upon that mad Virginia voyage. Now all's gone,--wealth, honors,\nfavor. Buckingham is the sun in heaven, and cold are the shadows in\nwhich we walk who hailed another luminary. There's a warrant out for\nthe Black Death; look to it that one meets not you too, when you come at\nlast. But come, in the name of all the fiends, and play your last card.\nThere's your cursed beauty still. Come, and let the King behold your\nface once more\"--The rest was hidden.\n\nI put out my hand and touched him upon the shoulder, and he raised his\nhead and stared at me as at one come from the grave.\n\nOver one side of his face, from temple to chin, was drawn and fastened\na black cloth; the unharmed cheek was bloodless and shrunken, the lip\ntwisted. Only the eyes, dark, sinister, and splendid, were as they had\nbeen. \"I dig not my graves deep enough,\" he said. \"Is she behind you\nthere in the shadow?\"\n\nFlung across a chair was a cloak of scarlet cloth. I took it and spread\nit out upon the floor, then unsheathed a dagger which I had taken from\nthe rack of weapons in the Governor's hall. \"Loosen thy poniard, thou\nmurderer,\" I cried, \"and come stand with me upon the cloak.\"\n\n\"Art quick or dead?\" he answered. \"I will not fight the dead.\" He had\nnot moved in his seat, and there was a lethargy and a dullness in his\nvoice and eyes. \"There is time enough,\" he said. \"I too will soon be\nof thy world, thou haggard, bloody shape. Wait until I come, and I will\nfight thee, shadow to shadow.\"\n\n\"I am not dead,\" I said, \"but there is one that is. Stand up, villain\nand murderer, or I will kill you sitting there, with her blood upon your\nhands!\"\n\nHe rose at that, and drew his dagger from the sheath. I laid aside my\ndoublet, and he followed my example, but his hands moved listlessly and\nhis fingers bungled at the fastenings. I waited for him in some wonder,\nit not being like him to come tardily to such pastime.\n\nHe came at length, slowly and with an uncertain step, and we stood\ntogether on the scarlet cloak. I raised my left arm and he raised his,\nand we locked hands. There was no strength in his clasp; his hand lay\nwithin mine cold and languid. \"Art ready?\" I demanded.\n\n\"Yea,\" he answered in a strange voice, \"but I would that she did\nnot stand there with her head upon your breast.... I too loved thee,\nJocelyn,--Jocelyn lying dead in the forest!\"\n\nI struck at him with the dagger in my right hand, and wounded him, but\nnot deeply, in the side. He gave blow for blow, but his poniard scarce\ndrew blood, so nerveless was the arm that would have driven it home. I\nstruck again, and he stabbed weakly at the air, then let his arm drop to\nhis side, as though the light and jeweled blade had weighed it down.\n\nLoosening the clasp of our left hands, I fell back until the narrow\nscarlet field was between us. \"Hast no more strength than that?\" I\ncried. \"I cannot murder you!\"\n\nHe stood looking past me as into a great distance. He was bleeding, but\nI had as yet been able to strike no mortal blow. \"It is as you choose,\"\nhe said. \"I am as one bound before you. I am sick unto death.\"\n\nTurning, he went back, swaying as he walked, to his chair, and sinking\ninto it sat there a minute with half-closed eyes; then raised his head\nand looked at me, with a shadow of the old arrogance, pride, and disdain\nupon his scarred face. \"Not yet, captain?\" he demanded. \"To the heart,\nman! So I would strike an you sat here and I stood there.\"\n\n\"I know you would,\" I said, and going to the window I flung the dagger\ndown into the empty street; then stood and watched the smoke across the\nriver, and thought it strange that the sun shone and the birds sang.\n\nWhen I turned to the room again, he still sat there in the great chair,\na tragic, splendid figure, with his ruined face and the sullen woe of\nhis eyes. \"I had sworn to kill you,\" I said. \"It is not just that you\nshould live.\"\n\nHe gazed at me with something like a smile upon his bloodless lips.\n\"Fret not thyself, Ralph Percy,\" he said. \"Within a week I shall be\ngone. Did you see my servant, my Italian doctor, lying dead upon the\nfloor, there beyond the screen? He had poisons, had Nicolo whom men\ncalled the Black Death,--poisons swift and strong, or subtle and slow.\nDay and night, the earth and sunshine have become hateful to me. I will\ngo to the fires of hell, and see if they can make me forget,--can make\nme forget the face of a woman.\" He was speaking half to me, half to\nhimself. \"Her eyes are dark and large,\" he said, \"and there are shadows\nbeneath them, and the mark of tears. She stands there day and night with\nher eyes upon me. Her lips are parted, but she never speaks. There was\na way that she had with her hands, holding them one within the other,\nthus\"--\n\nI stopped him with a cry for silence, and I leaned trembling against the\ntable. \"Thou wretch!\" I cried. \"Thou art her murderer!\"\n\nHe raised his head and looked beyond me with that strange, faint smile.\n\"I know,\" he replied, with the dignity which was his at times. \"You may\nplay the headsman, if you choose. I dispute not your right. But it is\nscarce worth while. I have taken poison.\"\n\nThe sunshine came into the room, and the wind from the river, and the\ntrumpet notes of swans flying to the north. \"The George is ready for\nsailing,\" he said at last. \"To-morrow or the next day she will be going\nhome with the tidings of this massacre. I shall go with her, and within\na week they will bury me at sea. There is a stealthy, slow, and secret\npoison.... I would not die in a land where I have lost every throw of\nthe dice, and I would not die in England for Buckingham to come and look\nupon my face, and so I took that poison. For the man upon the floor,\nthere,--prison and death awaited him at home. He chose to flee at once.\"\n\nHe ceased to speak, and sat with his head bowed upon his breast. \"If you\nare content that it should be as it is,\" he said at length, \"perhaps you\nwill leave me? I am not good company to-day.\"\n\nHis hand was busy again with the letter upon the table, and his gaze\nwas fixed beyond me. \"I have lost,\" he muttered. \"How I came to play\nmy cards so badly I do not know. The stake was heavy,--I have not\nwherewithal to play again.\"\n\nHis head sank upon his outstretched arm. As for me, I stood a minute\nwith set lips and clenched hands, and then I turned and went out of the\nroom and down the stair and out into the street. In the dust beneath\nthe window lay my dagger. I picked it up, sheathed it, and went my way.\n\nThe street was very quiet. All windows and doors were closed and barred;\nnot a soul was there to trouble me with look or speech. The yelling from\nthe forest had ceased; only the keen wind blew, and brought from the\nEsperance upon the river a sound of singing. The sea was the home of the\nmen upon her decks, and their hearts dwelt not in this port; they could\nsing while the smoke went up from our homes and the dead lay across the\nthresholds.\n\nI went on through the sunshine and the stillness to the minister's\nhouse. The trees in the garden were bare, the flowers dead. The door was\nnot barred. I entered the house and went into the great room and flung\nthe heavy shutters wide, then stood and looked about me. Naught was\nchanged; it was as we had left it that wild November night. Even the\nmirror which, one other night, had shown me Diccon still hung upon the\nwall. Master Bucke had been seldom at home, perhaps, or was feeble and\ncareless of altering matters. All was as though we had been but an hour\ngone, save that no fire burned upon the hearth.\n\nI went to the table, and the books upon it were Jeremy Sparrow's: the\nminister's house, then, had been his home once more. Beside the books\nlay a packet, tied with silk, sealed, and addressed to me. Perhaps the\nGovernor had given it, the day before, into Master Bucke's care,--I do\nnot know; at any rate, there it lay. I looked at the \"By the Esperance\"\nupon the cover, and wondered dully who at home would care to write to\nme; then broke the seal and untied the silk. Within the cover there\nwas a letter with the superscription, \"To a Gentleman who has served me\nwell.\"\n\nI read the letter through to the signature, which was that of his Grace\nof Buckingham, and then I laughed, who had never thought to laugh again,\nand threw the paper down. It mattered naught to me now that George\nVilliers should be grateful, or that James Stewart could deny a favorite\nnothing. \"The King graciously sanctions the marriage of his sometime\nward, the Lady Jocelyn Leigh, with Captain Ralph Percy; invites them\nhome\"--\n\nShe was gone home, and I her husband, I who loved her, was left behind.\nHow many years of pilgrimage... how long, how long, O Lord?\n\nThe minister's great armchair was drawn before the cold and blackened\nhearth. How often she had sat there within its dark clasp, the firelight\non her dress, her hands, her face! She had been fair to look upon; the\npride, the daring, the willfulness, were but the thorns about the rose;\nbehind those defenses was the flower, pure and lovely, with a heart of\ngold. I flung myself down beside the chair, and, putting my arms across\nit, hid my face upon them, and could weep at last.\n\nThat passion spent itself, and I lay with my face against the wood and\nwell-nigh slept. The battle was done; the field was lost; the storm\nand stress of life had sunk into this dull calm, as still as peace, as\nhopeless as the charred log and white ash upon the hearth, cold, never\nto be quickened again.\n\nTime passed, and at length I raised my head, roused suddenly to the\nconsciousness that for a while there had been no stillness. The air was\nfull of sound, shouts, savage cries, the beating of a drum, the noise\nof musketry. I sprang to my feet, and went to the door to meet Rolfe\ncrossing the threshold.\n\nHe put his arm within mine and drew me out into the sunshine upon the\ndoorstep. \"I thought I should find you here,\" he said; \"but it is only\na room with its memories, Ralph. Out here is more breadth, more height.\nThere is country yet, Ralph, and after a while, friends. The Indians\nare beginning to attack in force. Humphry Boyse is killed, and Morris\nChaloner. There is smoke over the plantations up and down the river, as\nfar as we can see, and awhile ago the body of a child drifted down to\nus.\"\n\n\"I am unarmed,\" I said. \"I will but run to the fort for sword and\nmusket\"--\n\n\"No need,\" he answered. \"There are the dead whom you may rob.\" The noise\nincreasing as he spoke, we made no further tarrying, but, leaving behind\nus house and garden, hurried to the palisade.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII IN WHICH I GO UPON A QUEST\n\n\nTHROUGH a loophole in the gate of the palisade I looked, and saw the\nsandy neck joining the town to the main, and the deep and dark woods\nbeyond, the fairy mantle giving invisibility to a host. Between us and\nthat refuge dead men lay here and there, stiff and stark, with the black\npaint upon them, and the colored feathers of their headdresses red or\nblue against the sand. One warrior, shot through the back, crawled like\na wounded beetle to the forest. We let him go, for we cared not to waste\nammunition upon him.\n\nI drew back from my loophole, and held out my hand to the women for a\nfreshly loaded musket. A quick murmur like the drawing of a breath came\nfrom our line. The Governor, standing near me, cast an anxious glance\nalong the stretch of wooden stakes that were neither so high nor so\nthick as they should have been. \"I am new to this warfare, Captain\nPercy,\" he said. \"Do they think to use those logs that they carry as\nbattering rams?\"\n\n\"As scaling ladders, your Honor,\" I replied. \"It is on the cards that we\nmay have some sword play, after all.\"\n\n\"We'll take your advice, the next time we build a palisade, Ralph\nPercy,\" muttered West on my other side. Mounting the breastwork that\nwe had thrown up to shelter the women who were to load the muskets, he\ncoolly looked over the pales at the oncoming savages. \"Wait until they\npass the blasted pine, men!\" he cried. \"Then give them a hail of lead\nthat will beat them back to the Pamunkey!\"\n\nAn arrow whistled by his ear; a second struck him on the shoulder, but\npierced not his coat of mail. He came down from his dangerous post with\na laugh.\n\n\"If the leader could be picked off\"--I said. \"It's a long shot, but\nthere's no harm in trying.\"\n\nAs I spoke I raised my gun to my shoulder; but he leaned across Rolfe,\nwho stood between us, and plucked me by the sleeve. \"You've not looked\nat him closely. Look again.\"\n\nI did as he told me, and lowered my musket. It was not for me to send\nthat Indian leader to his account. Rolfe's lips tightened and a sudden\npallor overspread his face. \"Nantauquas?\" he muttered in my ear, and I\nnodded yes.\n\nThe volley that we fired full into the ranks of our foe was deadly, and\nwe looked to see them turn and flee, as they had fled before. But this\ntime they were led by one who had been trained in English steadfastness.\nBroken for the moment, they rallied and came on yelling, bearing logs,\nthick branches of trees, oars tied together,--anything by whose help\nthey could hope to surmount the palisade. We fired again, but they had\nplanted their ladders. Before we could snatch the loaded muskets from\nthe women a dozen painted figures appeared above the sharpened stakes. A\nmoment, and they and a score behind them had leaped down upon us.\n\nIt was no time now to skulk behind a palisade. At all hazards, that tide\nfrom the forest must be stemmed. Those that were amongst us we might\nkill, but more were swarming after them, and from the neck came the\nexultant yelling of madly hurrying reinforcements.\n\nWe flung open the gates. I drove my sword through the heart of an Indian\nwho would have opposed me, and, calling for men to follow me, sprang\nforward. Perhaps thirty came at my call; together we made for the\nopening. A party of the savages in our midst interposed. We set upon\nthem with sword and musket butt, and though they fought like very devils\ndrove them before us through the gateway. Behind us were wild clamor,\nthe shrieking of women, the stern shouts of the English, the whooping of\nthe savages; before us a rush that must be met and turned.\n\nIt was done. A moment's fierce fighting, then the Indians wavered,\nbroke, and fled. Like sheep we drove them before us, across the neck,\nto the edge of the forest, into which they plunged. Into that ambush\nwe cared not to follow, but fell back to the palisade and the town,\nbelieving, and with reason, that the lesson had been taught. The strip\nof sand was strewn with the dead and the dying, but they belonged not to\nus. Our dead numbered but three, and we bore their bodies with us.\n\nWithin the palisade we found the English in sufficiently good case.\nOf the score or more Indians cut off by us from their mates and penned\nwithin that death trap, half at least were already dead, run through\nwith sword and pike, shot down with the muskets that there was now time\nto load. The remainder, hemmed about, pressed against the wall, were\nfast meeting with a like fate. They stood no chance against us; we cared\nnot to make prisoners of them; it was a slaughter, but they had taken\nthe initiative. They fought with the courage of despair, striving to\nspring in upon us, striking when they could with hatchet and knife,\nand through it all talking and laughing, making God knows what savage\nboasts, what taunts against the English, what references to the hunting\ngrounds to which they were going. They were brave men that we slew that\nday.\n\nAt last there was left but the leader,--unharmed, unwounded, though time\nand again he had striven to close with some one of us, to strike and\nto die striking with his fellows. Behind him was the wall: of the half\ncircle which he faced well-nigh all were old soldiers and servants of\nthe colony, gentlemen none of whom had come in later than Dale,--Rolfe,\nWest, Wynne, and others. We were swordsmen all. When in his desperation\nhe would have thrown himself upon us, we contented ourselves with\nkeeping him at sword's length, and at last West sent the knife in\nthe dark hand whirling over the palisade. Some one had shouted to the\nmusketeers to spare him.\n\nWhen he saw that he stood alone, he stepped back against the wall, drew\nhimself up to his full height, and folded his arms. Perhaps he thought\nthat we would shoot him down then and there; perhaps he saw himself a\ncaptive amongst us, a show for the idle and for the strangers that the\nships brought in.\n\nThe din had ceased, and we the living, the victors, stood and looked at\nthe vanquished dead at our feet, and at the dead beyond the gates, and\nat the neck upon which was no living foe, and at the blue sky bending\nover all. Our hearts told us, and told us truly, that the lesson had\nbeen taught, that no more forever need we at Jamestown fear an Indian\nattack. And then we looked at him whose life we had spared.\n\nHe opposed our gaze with his folded arms and his head held high and his\nback against the wall. Many of us could remember him, a proud, shy lad,\ncoming for the first time from the forest with his sister to see the\nEnglish village and its wonders. For idleness we had set him in our\nmidst that summer day, long ago, on the green by the fort, and had\ncalled him \"your royal highness,\" laughing at the quickness of our wit,\nand admiring the spirit and bearing of the lad and the promise he gave\nof a splendid manhood. And all knew the tale I had brought the night\nbefore.\n\nSlowly, as one man, and with no spoken word, we fell back, the half\ncircle straightening into a line and leaving a clear pathway to the open\ngates. The wind had ceased to blow, I remember, and a sunny stillness\nlay upon the sand, and the rough-hewn wooden stakes, and a little patch\nof tender grass across which stretched a dead man's arm. The church\nbells began to ring.\n\nThe Indian out of whose path to life and freedom we had stepped glanced\nfrom the line of lowered steel to the open gates and the forest beyond,\nand understood. For a full minute he waited, moving not a muscle, still\nand stately as some noble masterpiece in bronze. Then he stepped from\nthe shadow of the wall and moved past us through the sunshine that\nturned the eagle feather in his scalp lock to gold. His eyes were fixed\nupon the forest; there was no change in the superb calm of his face. He\nwent by the huddled dead and the long line of the living that spoke no\nword, and out of the gates and across the neck, walking slowly that we\nmight yet shoot him down if we saw fit to repent ourselves, and proudly\nlike a king's son. There was no sound save the church bells ringing for\nour deliverance. He reached the shadow of the trees: a moment, and the\nforest had back her own.\n\nWe sheathed our swords and listened to the Governor's few earnest words\nof thankfulness and of recognition of this or that man's service, and\nthen we set to work to clear the ground of the dead, to place sentinels,\nto bring the town into order, to determine what policy we should pursue,\nto search for ways by which we might reach and aid those who might be\nyet alive in the plantations above and below us.\n\nWe could not go through the forest where every tree might hide a foe,\nbut there was the river. For the most part, the houses of the English\nhad been built, like mine at Weyanoke, very near to the water. I\nvolunteered to lead a party up river, and Wynne to go with another\ntoward the bay. But as the council at the Governor's was breaking up,\nand as Wynne and I were hurrying off to make our choice of the craft at\nthe landing, there came a great noise from the watchers upon the bank,\nand a cry that boats were coming down the stream.\n\nIt was so, and there were in them white men, nearly all of whom had\ntheir wounds to show, and cowering women and children. One boat had come\nfrom the plantation at Paspahegh, and two from Martin-Brandon; they held\nall that were left of the people.... A woman had in her lap the body\nof a child, and would not let us take it from her; another, with a\nhalf-severed arm, crouched above a man who lay in his blood in the\nbottom of the boat.\n\nThus began that strange procession that lasted throughout the afternoon\nand night and into the next day, when a sloop came down from Henricus\nwith the news that the English were in force there to stand their\nground, although their loss had been heavy. Hour after hour they came\nas fast as sail and oar could bring them, the panic-stricken folk, whose\nhomes were burned, whose kindred were slain, who had themselves escaped\nas by a miracle. Many were sorely wounded, so that they died when we\nlifted them from the boats; others had slighter hurts. Each boatload\nhad the same tale to tell of treachery, surprise, and fiendish butchery.\nWherever it had been possible the English had made a desperate defense,\nin the face of which the savages gave way and finally retired to the\nforest. Contrary to their wont, the Indians took few prisoners, but for\nthe most part slew outright those whom they seized, wreaking their\nspite upon the senseless corpses. A man too good for this world, George\nThorpe, who would think no evil, was killed and his body mutilated by\nthose whom he had taught and loved. And Nathaniel Powel was dead, and\nfour others of the Council, besides many more of name and note. There\nwere many women slain and little children.\n\nFrom the stronger hundreds came tidings of the number lost, and that the\nsurvivors would hold the homes that were left, for the time at least.\nThe Indians had withdrawn; it remained to be seen if they were satisfied\nwith the havoc they had wrought. Would his Honor send by boat--there\ncould be no traveling through the woods--news of how others had fared,\nand also powder and shot?\n\nBefore the dawning we had heard from all save the remoter settlements.\nThe blow had been struck, and the hurt was deep. But it was not beyond\nremedy, thank God! It is known what measures we took for our protection,\nand how soon the wound to the colony was healed, and what vengeance we\nmeted out to those who had set upon us in the dark, and had failed to\nreach the heart. These things belong to history, and I am but telling my\nown story,--mine and another's.\n\nIn the chill and darkness of the hour before dawn something like quiet\nfell upon the distracted, breathless town. There was a pause in the\ncoming of the boats. The wounded and the dying had been cared for, and\nthe noise of the women and the children was stilled at last. All was\nwell at the palisade; the strong party encamped upon the neck reported\nthe forest beyond them as still as death.\n\nIn the Governor's house was held a short council, subdued and quiet, for\nwe were all of one mind and our words were few. It was decided that the\nGeorge should sail at once with the tidings, and with an appeal for arms\nand powder and a supply of men. The Esperance would still be with us,\nbesides the Hope-in-God and the Tiger; the Margaret and John would\nshortly come in, being already overdue.\n\n\"My Lord Carnal goes upon the George, gentlemen,\" said Master Pory. \"He\nsent but now to demand if she sailed to-morrow. He is ill, and would be\nat home.\"\n\nOne or two glanced at me, but I sat with a face like stone, and the\nGovernor, rising, broke up the council.\n\nI left the house, and the street that was lit with torches and noisy\nwith going to and fro, and went down to the river. Rolfe had been\ndetained by the Governor, West commanded the party at the neck. There\nwere great fires burning along the river bank, and men watching for the\nincoming boats; but I knew of a place where no guard was set, and where\none or two canoes were moored. There was no firelight there, and no one\nsaw me when I entered a canoe and cut the rope and pushed off from the\nland.\n\nWell-nigh a day and a night had passed since Lady Wyatt had told me that\nwhich made for my heart a night-time indeed. I believed my wife to\nbe dead,--yea, I trusted that she was dead. I hoped that it had been\nquickly over,--one blow.... Better that, oh, better that a thousand\ntimes, than that she should have been carried off to some village, saved\nto-day to die a thousand deaths to-morrow.\n\nBut I thought that there might have been left, lying on the dead leaves\nof the forest, that fair shell from which the soul had flown. I knew not\nwhere to go,--to the north, to the east, to the west,--but go I must. I\nhad no hope of finding that which I went to seek, and no thought but to\ntake up that quest. I was a soldier, and I had stood to my post; but now\nthe need was past, and I could go. In the hall at the Governor's house,\nI had written a line of farewell to Rolfe, and had given the paper into\nthe hand of a trusty fellow, charging him not to deliver it for two\nhours to come.\n\nI rowed two miles downstream through the quiet darkness,--so quiet after\nthe hubbub of the town. When I turned my boat to the shore the day\nwas close at hand. The stars were gone, and a pale, cold light, more\ndesolate than the dark, streamed from the east across which ran, like\na faded blood stain, a smear of faint red. Upon the forest the mist lay\nheavy. When I drove the boat in amongst the sedge and reeds below the\nbank, I could see only the trunks of the nearest trees, hear only the\nsullen cry of some river bird that I had disturbed.\n\nWhy I was at some pains to fasten the boat to a sycamore that dipped a\npallid arm into the stream I do not know. I never thought to come back\nto the sycamore; I never thought to bend to an oar again, to behold\nagain the river that the trees and the mist hid from me before I had\ngone twenty yards into the forest.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX IN WHICH WE LISTEN TO A SONG\n\n\nIT was like a May morning, so mild was the air, so gay the sunshine,\nwhen the mist had risen. Wild flowers were blooming, and here and there\nunfolding leaves made a delicate fretwork against a deep blue sky.\nThe wind did not blow; everywhere were stillness soft and sweet, dewy\nfreshness, careless peace.\n\nHour after hour I walked slowly through the woodland, pausing now and\nthen to look from side to side. It was idle going, wandering in a desert\nwith no guiding star. The place where I would be might lie to the east,\nto the west. In the wide enshrouding forest I might have passed it by.\nI believed not that I had done so. Surely, surely I should have known;\nsurely the voice that lived only in my heart would have called to me to\nstay.\n\nBeside a newly felled tree, in a glade starred with small white flowers,\nI came upon the bodies of a man and a boy, so hacked, so hewn, so robbed\nof all comeliness, that at the sight the heart stood still and the brain\ngrew sick. Farther on was a clearing, and in its midst the charred and\nblackened walls of what had been a home. I crossed the freshly turned\nearth, and looked in at the cabin door with the stillness and the\nsunshine. A woman lay dead upon the floor, her outstretched hand\nclenched upon the foot of a cradle. I entered the room, and, looking\nwithin the cradle, found that the babe had not been spared. Taking up\nthe little waxen body with the blood upon its innocent breast, I laid\nit within the mother's arms, and went my way over the sunny doorstep and\nthe earth that had been made ready for planting. A white butterfly--the\nfirst of the year--fluttered before me; then rose through a mist of\ngreen and passed from my sight.\n\nThe sun climbed higher into the deep blue sky. Save where grew pines or\ncedars there were no shadowy places in the forest. The slight green of\nuncurling leaves, the airy scarlet of the maples, the bare branches of\nthe tardier trees, opposed no barrier to the sunlight. It streamed into\nthe world below the treetops, and lay warm upon the dead leaves and the\ngreen moss and the fragile wild flowers. There was a noise of birds,\nand a fox barked. All was lightness, gayety, and warmth; the sap was\nrunning, the heyday of the spring at hand. Ah! to be riding with her,\nto be going home through the fairy forest, the sunshine, and the\nsinging!... The happy miles to Weyanoke, the smell of the sassafras in\nits woods, the house all lit and trimmed. The fire kindled, the wine\nupon the table... Diccon's welcoming face, and his hand upon Black\nLamoral's bridle; the minister, too, maybe, with his great heart and his\nkindly eyes; her hand in mine, her head upon my breast--\n\nThe vision faded. Never, never, never for me a home-coming such as that,\nso deep, so dear, so sweet. The men who were my friends, the woman whom\nI loved, had gone into a far country. This world was not their home.\nThey had crossed the threshold while I lagged behind. The door was shut,\nand without were the night and I.\n\nWith the fading of the vision came a sudden consciousness of a presence\nin the forest other than my own. I turned sharply, and saw an Indian\nwalking with me, step for step, but with a space between us of earth and\nbrown tree trunks and drooping branches. For a moment I thought that\nhe was a shadow, not substance; then I stood still, waiting for him to\nspeak or to draw nearer. At the first glimpse of the bronze figure I had\ntouched my sword, but when I saw who it was I let my hand fall. He too\npaused, but he did not offer to speak. With his hand upon a great bow,\nhe waited, motionless in the sunlight. A minute or more thus; then I\nwalked on with my eyes upon him.\n\nAt once he addressed himself to motion, not speaking or making any sign\nor lessening the distance between us, but moving as I moved through the\nlight and shade, the warmth and stillness, of the forest. For a time\nI kept my eyes upon him, but soon I was back with my dreams again. It\nseemed not worth while to wonder why he walked with me, who was now the\nmortal foe of the people to whom he had returned.\n\nFrom the river bank, the sycamore, and the boat that I had fastened\nthere, I had gone northward toward the Pamunkey; from the clearing and\nthe ruined cabin with the dead within it, I had turned to the eastward.\nNow, in that hopeless wandering, I would have faced the north again. But\nthe Indian who had made himself my traveling companion stopped short,\nand pointed to the east. I looked at him, and thought that he knew,\nmaybe, of some war party between us and the Pamunkey, and would save\nme from it. A listlessness had come upon me, and I obeyed the pointing\nfinger.\n\nSo, estranged and silent, with two spears' length of earth between us,\nwe went on until we came to a quiet stream flowing between low, dark\nbanks. Again I would have turned to the northward, but the son of\nPowhatan, gliding before me, set his face down the stream, toward the\nriver I had left. A minute in which I tried to think and could not,\nbecause in my ears was the singing of the birds at Weyanoke; then I\nfollowed him.\n\nHow long I walked in a dream, hand in hand with the sweetness of the\npast, I do not know; but when the present and its anguish weighed\nagain upon my heart it was darker, colder, stiller, in the forest. The\nsoundless stream was bright no longer; the golden sunshine that had lain\nupon the earth was all gathered up; the earth was dark and smooth and\nbare, with not a flower; the tree trunks were many and straight and\ntall. Above were no longer brown branch and blue sky, but a deep and\nsombre green, thick woven, keeping out the sunlight like a pall. I stood\nstill and gazed around me, and knew the place.\n\nTo me, whose heart was haunted, the dismal wood, the charmed silence,\nthe withdrawal of the light, were less than nothing. All day I had\nlooked for one sight of horror; yea, had longed to come at last upon it,\nto fall beside it, to embrace it with my arms. There, there, though it\nshould be some fair and sunny spot, there would be my haunted wood. As\nfor this place of gloom and stillness, it fell in with my mood. More\nwelcome than the mocking sunshine were this cold and solemn light, this\ndeathlike silence, these ranged pines. It was a place in which to think\nof life as a slight thing and scarcely worth the while, given without\nthe asking, spent in turmoil, strife, suffering, and longings all in\nvain. Easily laid down, too,--so easily laid down that the wonder was--\n\nI looked at the ghostly wood, and at the dull stream, and at my hand\nupon the hilt of the sword that I had drawn halfway from the scabbard.\nThe life within that hand I had not asked for. Why should I stand like\na soldier left to guard a thing not worth the guarding; seeing\nhis comrades march homeward, hearing a cry to him from his distant\nhearthstone?\n\nI drew my sword well-nigh from its sheath; and then of a sudden I saw\nthe matter in a truer light; knew that I was indeed the soldier, and\nwilled to be neither coward nor deserter. The blade dropped back into\nthe scabbard with a clang, and, straightening myself, I walked on beside\nthe sluggish stream deep into the haunted wood.\n\nPresently it occurred to me to glance aside at the Indian who had kept\npace with me through the forest. He was not there; he walked with me no\nlonger; save for myself there seemed no breathing creature in the dim\nwood. I looked to right and left, and saw only the tall, straight pines\nand the needle-strewn ground. How long he had been gone I could not\ntell. He might have left me when first we came to the pines, for my\ndreams had held me, and I had not looked his way.\n\nThere was that in the twilight place, or in the strangeness, the horror,\nand the yearning that had kept company with me that day, or in the dull\nweariness of a mind and body overwrought of late, which made thought\nimpossible. I went on down the stream toward the river, because it\nchanced that my face was set in that direction.\n\nHow dark was the shadow of the pines, how lifeless the earth beneath,\nhow faint and far away the blue that showed here and there through rifts\nin the heavy roof of foliage! The stream bending to one side I turned\nwith it, and there before me stood the minister!\n\nI do not know what strangled cry burst from me. The earth was rocking,\nall the wood a glare of light. As for him, at the sight of me and\nthe sound of my voice he had staggered back against a tree; but now,\nrecovering himself, he ran to me and put his great arms about me. \"From\nthe power of the dog, from the lion's mouth,\" he cried brokenly. \"And\nthey slew thee not, Ralph, the heathen who took thee away! Yesternight I\nlearned that you lived, but I looked not for you here.\"\n\nI scarce heard or marked what he was saying, and found no time in which\nto wonder at his knowledge that I had not perished. I only saw that\nhe was alone, and that in the evening wood there was no sign of other\nliving creature.\n\n\"Yea, they slew me not, Jeremy,\" I said. \"I would that they had done so.\nAnd you are alone? I am glad that you died not, my friend; yes, faith,\nI am very glad that one escaped. Tell me about it, and I will sit here\nupon the bank and listen. Was it done in this wood? A gloomy deathbed,\nfriend, for one so young and fair. She should have died to soft music,\nin the sunshine, with flowers about her.\"\n\nWith an exclamation he put me from him, but kept his hand upon my arm\nand his steady eyes upon my face.\n\n\"She loved laughter and sunshine and sweet songs,\" I continued. \"She\ncan never know them in this wood. They are outside; they are outside the\nworld, I think. It is sad, is it not? Faith, I think it is the saddest\nthing I have ever known.\"\n\nHe clapped his other hand upon my shoulder. \"Wake, man!\" he commanded.\n\"If thou shouldst go mad now--Wake! thy brain is turning. Hold to\nthyself. Stand fast, as thou art soldier and Christian! Ralph, she\nis not dead. She will wear flowers,--thy flowers,--sing, laugh, move\nthrough the sunshine of earth for many and many a year, please God! Art\nlistening, Ralph? Canst hear what I am saying?\"\n\n\"I hear,\" I said at last, \"but I do not well understand.\"\n\nHe pushed me back against a pine, and held me there with his hands upon\nmy shoulders. \"Listen,\" he said, speaking rapidly and keeping his\neyes upon mine. \"All those days that you were gone, when all the world\ndeclared you dead, she believed you living. She saw party after party\ncome back without you, and she believed that you were left behind in the\nforest. Also she knew that the George waited but for the search to be\nquite given over, and for my Lord Carnal's recovery. She had been told\nthat the King's command might not be defied, that the Governor had no\nchoice but to send her from Virginia. Ralph, I watched her, and I knew\nthat she meant not to go upon that ship. Three nights agone she stole\nfrom the Governor's house, and, passing through the gates that the\nsleeping warder had left unfastened, went toward the forest. I saw her\nand followed her, and at the edge of the forest I spoke to her. I stayed\nher not, I brought her not back, Ralph, because I was convinced that an\nI did so she would die. I knew of no great danger, and I trusted in the\nLord to show me what to do, step by step, and how to guide her gently\nback when she was weary of wandering,--when, worn out, she was willing\nto give up the quest for the dead. Art following me, Ralph?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I answered, and took my hand from my eyes. \"I was nigh mad,\nJeremy, for my faith was not like hers. I have looked on Death too much\nof late, and yesterday all men believed that he had come to dwell in the\nforest and had swept clean his house before him. But you escaped, you\nboth escaped\"--\n\n\"God's hand was over us,\" he said reverently. \"This is the way of it.\nShe had been ill, you know, and of late she had taken no thought of food\nor sleep. She was so weak, we had to go so slowly, and so winding was\nour path, who knew not the country, that the evening found us not far\nupon our way, if way we had. We came to a cabin in a clearing, and they\nwhose home it was gave us shelter for the night. In the morning, when\nthe father and son would go forth to their work we walked with them.\nWhen they came to the trees they meant to fell we bade them good-by, and\nwent on alone. We had not gone an hundred paces when, looking back, we\nsaw three Indians start from the dimness of the forest and set upon and\nslay the man and the boy. That murder done they gave chase to me, who\ncaught up thy wife and ran for both our lives. When I saw that they were\nlight of foot and would overtake me, I set my burden down, and, drawing\na sword that I had with me, went back to meet them halfway. Ralph, I\nslew all three,--may the Lord have mercy on my soul! I knew not what to\nthink of that attack, the peace with the Indians being so profound, and\nI began to fear for thy wife's safety. She knew not the woods, and I\nmanaged to turn our steps back toward Jamestown without her knowledge\nthat I did so. It was about midday when we saw the gleam of the river\nthrough the trees before us, and heard the sound of firing and of a\ngreat yelling. I made her crouch within a thicket, while I myself went\nforward to reconnoitre, and well-nigh stumbled into the midst of an\narmy. Yelling, painted, maddened, brandishing their weapons toward the\ntown, human hair dabbled with blood at the belts of many--in the name of\nGod, Ralph, what is the meaning of it all?\"\n\n\"It means,\" I said, \"that yesterday they rose against us and slew us by\nthe hundred. The town was warned and is safe. Go on.\"\n\n\"I crept back to madam,\" he continued, \"and hurried her away from that\ndangerous neighborhood. We found a growth of bushes and hid ourselves\nwithin it, and just in time, for from the north came a great band of\npicked warriors, tall and black and wondrously feathered, fresh to the\nfray, whatever the fray might be. They joined themselves to the imps\nupon the river bank, and presently we heard another great din with more\nfiring and more yelling. Well, to make a long story short, we crouched\nthere in the bushes until late afternoon, not knowing what was the\nmatter, and not daring to venture forth to find out. The woman of the\ncabin at which we had slept had given us a packet of bread and meat, so\nwe were not without food, but the time was long. And then of a sudden\nthe wood around us was filled with the heathen, band after band, coming\nfrom the river, stealing like serpents this way and that into the depths\nof the forest. They saw us not in the thick bushes; maybe it was because\nof the prayers which I said with might and main. At last the distance\nswallowed them, the forest seemed clear, no sound, no motion. Long we\nwaited, but with the sunset we stole from the bushes and down an aisle\nof the forest toward the river, rounded a little wood of cedar, and\ncame full upon perhaps fifty of the savages\"--He paused to draw a great\nbreath and to raise his brows after a fashion that he had.\n\n\"Go on, go on!\" I cried. \"What did you do? You have said that she is\nalive and safe!\"\n\n\"She is,\" he answered, \"but no thanks to me, though I did set lustily\nupon that painted fry. Who led them, d' ye think, Ralph? Who saved us\nfrom those bloody hands?\"\n\nA light broke in upon me. \"I know,\" I said. \"And he brought you here\"--\n\n\"Ay, he sent away the devils whose color he is, worse luck! He told us\nthat there were Indians, not of his tribe, between us and the town. If\nwe went on we should fall into their hands. But there was a place that\nwas shunned by the Indian as by the white man: we could bide there until\nthe morrow, when we might find the woods clear. He guided us to this\ndismal wood that was not altogether strange to us. Ay, he told her that\nyou were alive. He said no more than that; all at once, when we were\nwell within the wood and the twilight was about us, he was gone.\"\n\nHe ceased to speak, and stood regarding me with a smile upon his rugged\nface. I took his hand and raised it to my lips. \"I owe you more than I\ncan ever pay,\" I said. \"Where is she, my friend?\"\n\n\"Not far away,\" he answered. \"We sought the centre of the wood, and\nbecause she was so chilled and weary and shaken I did dare to build a\nfire there. Not a foe has come against us, and we waited but for the\ndusk of this evening to try to make the town. I came down to the stream\njust now to find, if I could, how near we were to the river\"--\n\nHe broke off, made a gesture with his hand toward one of the long aisles\nof pine trees, and then, with a muttered \"God bless you both,\" left me,\nand going a little way down the stream, stood with his back to a great\ntree and his eyes upon the slow, deep water.\n\nShe was coming. I watched the slight figure grow out of the dusk between\nthe trees, and the darkness in which I had walked of late fell away. The\nwood that had been so gloomy was a place of sunlight and song; had red\nroses sprung up around me I had felt no wonder. She came softly and\nslowly, with bent head and hanging arms, not knowing that I was near.\nI went not to meet her,--it was my fancy to have her come to me\nstill,--but when she raised her eyes and saw me I fell upon my knees.\n\nFor a moment she stood still, with her hands at her bosom; then, softly\nand slowly through the dusky wood, she came to me and touched me upon\nthe shoulder. \"Art come to take me home?\" she asked. \"I have wept and\nprayed and waited long, but now the spring is here and the woods are\ngrowing green.\"\n\nI took her hands and bowed my head upon them. \"I believed thee dead,\"\nI said. \"I thought that thou hadst gone home, indeed, and I was left in\nthe world alone. I can never tell thee how I love thee.\"\n\n\"I need no telling,\" she answered. \"I am glad that I did so forget my\nwomanhood as to come to Virginia on such an errand; glad that they did\nlaugh at and insult me in the meadow at Jamestown, for else thou mightst\nhave given me no thought; very heartily glad that thou didst buy me with\nthy handful of tobacco. With all my heart I love thee, my knight, my\nlover, my lord and husband\"--Her voice broke, and I felt the trembling\nof her frame. \"I love not thy tears upon my hands,\" she murmured. \"I\nhave wandered far and am weary. Wilt rise and put thy arm around me and\nlead me home?\"\n\nI stood up, and she came to my arms like a tired bird to its nest. I\nbent my head, and kissed her upon the brow, the blue-veined eyelids, the\nperfect lips. \"I love thee,\" I said. \"The song is old, but it is sweet.\nSee! I wear thy color, my lady.\"\n\nThe hand that had touched the ribbon upon my arm stole upwards to my\nlips. \"An old song, but a sweet one,\" she said. \"I love thee. I will\nalways love thee. My head may lie upon thy breast, but my heart lies at\nthy feet.\"\n\nThere was joy in the haunted wood, deep peace, quiet thankfulness, a\nspringtime of the heart,--not riotous like the May, but fair and grave\nand tender like the young world in the sunshine without the pines. Our\nlips met again, and then, with my arm around her, we moved to the giant\npine beneath which stood the minister. He turned at our approach, and\nlooked at us with a quiet and tender smile, though the water stood\nin his eyes. \"'Heaviness may endure for a night,'\" he said, \"'but joy\ncometh in the morning.' I thank God for you both.\"\n\n\"Last summer, in the green meadow, we knelt before you while you blessed\nus, Jeremy,\" I answered. \"Bless us now again, true friend and man of\nGod.\"\n\nHe laid his hands upon our bowed heads and blessed us, and then we three\nmoved through the dismal wood and beside the sluggish stream down to\nthe great bright river. Ere we reached it the pines had fallen away, the\nhaunted wood was behind us, our steps were set through a fairy world of\ngreening bough and springing bloom. The blue sky laughed above, the late\nsunshine barred our path with gold. When we came to the river it lay in\nsilver at our feet, making low music amongst its reeds.\n\nI had bethought me of the boat which I had fastened that morning to the\nsycamore between us and the town, and now we moved along the river bank\nuntil we should come to the tree. Though we walked through an enemy's\ncountry we saw no foe. Stillness and peace encompassed us; it was like a\nbeautiful dream from which one fears no wakening.\n\nAs we went, I told them, speaking low, for we knew not if we were yet\nin safety, of the slaughter that had been made and of Diccon. My wife\nshuddered and wept, and the minister drew long breaths while his hands\nopened and closed. And then, when she asked me, I told of how I had been\ntrapped to the ruined hut that night and of all that had followed.\nWhen I had done she turned within my arm and clung to me with her face\nhidden. I kissed her and comforted her, and presently we came to the\nsycamore tree reaching out over the clear water, and to the boat that I\nhad fastened there.\n\nThe sunset was nigh at hand, and all the west was pink. The wind had\ndied away, and the river lay like tinted glass between the dark borders\nof the forest. Above the sky was blue, while in the south rose clouds\nthat were like pillars, tall and golden. The air was soft as silk; there\nwas no sound other than the ripple of the water about our keel and the\nlow dash of the oars. The minister rowed, while I sat idle beside my\nlove. He would have it so, and I made slight demur.\n\nWe left the bank behind us and glided into the midstream, for it was as\nwell to be out of arrowshot. The shadow of the forest was gone; still\nand bright around us lay the mighty river. When at length the boat head\nturned to the west, we saw far up the stream the roofs of Jamestown,\ndark against the rosy sky.\n\n\"There is a ship going home,\" said the minister.\n\nWe to whom he spoke looked with him down the river, and saw a tall ship\nwith her prow to the ocean. All her sails were set; the last rays of the\nsinking sun struck against her poop windows and made of them a half-moon\nof fire. She went slowly, for the wind was light, but she went surely,\naway from the new land back to the old, down the stately river to the\nbay and the wide ocean, and to the burial at sea of one upon her. With\nher pearly sails and the line of flame color beneath, she looked\na dwindling cloud; a little while, and she would be claimed of the\ndistance and the dusk.\n\n\"It is the George,\" I said.\n\nThe lady who sat beside me caught her breath. \"Ay, sweetheart,\" I went\non. \"She carries one for whom she waited. He has gone from out our life\nforever.\"\n\nShe uttered a low cry and turned to me, trembling, her lips parted, her\neyes eloquent. \"We will not speak of him,\" I said. \"As if he were dead\nlet his name rest between us. I have another thing to tell thee, dear\nheart, dear court lady masking as a waiting damsel, dear ward of the\nKing whom his Majesty hath thundered against for so many weary months.\nWould it grieve thee to go home, after all?\"\n\n\"Home?\" she asked. \"To Weyanoke? That would not grieve me.\"\n\n\"Not to Weyanoke, but to England,\" I said. \"The George is gone, but\nthree days since the Esperance came in. When she sails again I think\nthat we must go.\"\n\nShe gazed at me with a whitening face. \"And you?\" she whispered. \"How\nwill you go? In chains?\"\n\nI took her clasped hands, parted them, and drew her arms around my neck.\n\"Ay,\" I answered, \"I will go in chains that I care not to have broken.\nMy dear love, I think that the summer lies fair before us. Listen while\nI tell thee of news that the Esperance brought.\"\n\nWhile I told of new orders from the Company to the Governor and of my\nletter from Buckingham, the minister rested upon his oars that he might\nhear the better. When I had ceased to speak he bent to them again, and\nhis tireless strength sent us swiftly over the glassy water toward the\ntown that was no longer distant. \"I am more glad than I can tell you,\nRalph and Jocelyn,\" he said, and the smile with which he spoke made his\nface beautiful.\n\nThe light streaming to us from the ruddy west laid roses in the cheeks\nof the sometime ward of the King, and the low wind lifted the dark hair\nfrom her forehead. Her head was on my breast, her hand in mine; we cared\nnot to speak, we were so happy. On her finger was her wedding ring, the\nring that was only a link torn from the gold chain Prince Maurice had\ngiven me. When she saw my eyes upon it, she raised her hand and kissed\nthe rude circlet.\n\nThe hue of the sunset lingered in cloud and water, and in the pale\nheavens above the rose and purple shone the evening star. The cloudlike\nship at which we had gazed was gone into the distance and the twilight;\nwe saw her no more. Broad between its blackening shores stretched the\nJames, mirroring the bloom in the west, the silver star, the lights upon\nthe Esperance that lay between us and the town. Aboard her the mariners\nwere singing, and their song of the sea floated over the water to us,\nsweetly and like a love song. We passed the ship unhailed, and glided on\nto the haven where we would be. The singing behind us died away, but the\nsong in our hearts kept on. All things die not: while the soul lives,\nlove lives: the song may be now gay, now plaintive, but it is deathless.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of To Have and To Hold, by Mary Johnston\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK TO HAVE AND TO HOLD ***\n\n***** This file should be named 2807-8.txt or 2807-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/2\/8\/0\/2807\/\n\nProduced by David Reed\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":826,"split":"train"}
